The concern was strictly a private
bank, having no directors. Kellogg
claimed to the depositors that he was
secured by an indemnity bond. Banks
of this character are not examined by
State or Federal officials.
A meeting of a number of depositors
of the bank was held thl3 afternoon.
All moneys received by the cashier on
the 14th, which was the last day the
bank was open, were returned to de
po&itors. A committee was appointed
to examine the books, moneys and se
curities and to report next Monday.
So far as can be ascertained, here Is
no shortage.
The general belief Is that Kellogg,
having become tired of the. banking
business in Cleelum, simply threw up
his hands, leaving Cashier Sasse to
straighten out the accounts.

characterizes the dastardly nature of
the deed."
The Sviet remarks: "The commission
of the crime in the highest government
building in Finland, where the Czar
would justly regard himself as abso
lutely safe, has incensed the whole of
thinking Russia. Bobrikoff was gentle,
noble and condescending, and of un
blemished morality. His only enemies
were Russia's enemies."
The Llstok says: "The crime can
evoke nothing but the deepest censure
in Russia, as well as in Finland, where
the royal section will understand its
senselessness. It is hoped that com
mon sense will get the upper hand of
the propaganda which Is pushing the
country."

himself to be a stout, honest defender
of Russia's imperial interests.

ashore. All the watches taken from
the bodies of the drowned stopped be

"open shop." With the exception of
two or three, however, all agreements
signed in the year with the union pro

its members. J
The resolution .follows:
"Resolved. That thi3 association in
structs its members to refuse to sign

any sort be signed with them which

CHICAGO, June 17. â The Employ
ers' Association of Chicago has set
May 1, 1905, as the date for a general
contest with the Teamsters' Union. A
resolution carrying this decision, re
cently passed by the executive board,
has just been made public. The or
ganization in the meantime will pre
pare for the struggle:
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind.. June 17.â A
cablegram to the Indianapolis News
from Stanley Washburn, special war
correspondent of the Chicago News at
Chefu, says that Hector Fuller, staff
war correspondent of the Indianapolis
News, has been captured by four Rus
sian soldiers and taken to Port Arthur.
Fuller was blindfolded and placed in
prison.
The State Department at Washington
was notified last Wednesday that Ful
ler, who started from Chefu m an open
boat with two Chinese oarsn^en for Port
Arthur, had landed in the vicinity of
the latter city about June 12.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â The State
Department has received the following
reply from Minister Griscom at Tokio
in response to its inquiry regarding the
disappearance of Hector Fuller, the In
dianapolis war correspondent:
"Washburn of Chicago News states
that Fuller was arrÂ«sted at Port Arthur
on the 13th inst."
Russian Soldiers Place Him in Prison
at Port Arthur.
CORRESPONDENT IN JAIL.
As these boats move along, the mo
tion of the long oars resemble the
legs of the Chinese dragon, and the
rowers rise and stand in their seats,
thus completing the resemblance to
the dragon's body. A drummer accom
panies each boat to beat time.
A peculiar preparation of hulled rice,
soaked in lye and wrapped In palm
leaves, is thrown out to the hungry
fishes, | so that they may be induced
to restrain their appetites and not feast
upon the remains' of the drowned hero.
It Is called "chung," which is a pun
on the Chinese word for faithfulness,
which is "chung" also. In all the
grocery stores in Chinatown piles of
"chung" have been exposed for sale
for a week past, and the small boy
has held a feast on his own account,
â¢regardless of the fishes.
Here and there may be found a few
faithful hearts who remember the
legend, and repeat as the boats rush
past:
"Wat Yuen chi nik shuie: Tuen
yeung king to. Wat Perfection haa
jumped into the water. Who arrives
first to rescue him."
Yesterday all Chinatown celebrated
the Dragon Boat festival. Feasts were
served in the public restaurants and
private homes and last night the larg
est restaurant in the quarter was the
scene of j great festivity. At the res
taurant the Chinese Military Corps was
entertained by the Sheung Mo Hok
Tong Military Association. Speeches
by Wong Kim, Dr. Gardiner. Major
Falkenberg and others were followed
by the presentation of the- Chinese
dragon flag and the Stars and Stripes
by Dr. Gardiner to the Sheung Mo
Hok Tong Military Association. . Toasts
to the Emperor Kwang-Su, President
Roosevelt, Wong Kim, the organizer;
Chan Kei, the president; and to the
cueless Chinese of San Francisco.
The holiday is one of the most noted
in the Chinese calendar. The legend
of the dragon boat runs as follows:
Many years ago Wat Yuen, a loyal
hearted noble of the Celestial kingdom,
who had served his country and sov
ereign faithfully, was forgotten when
the royal favors were dispensed. Later
when his services were recalled to the
memory of the King, he was ordered
to the palace to receive his reward.
But he had learned not to put his
trust in princes, and rather than accept
the belated kindness he threw, himself
into the river. So, full of admiration
for this unprecedented act of humility,
the anniversary of the same was set
apart as a national holiday, and the
fifth day of the fifth month is observed
by the patriotic Cllnamen throughout
the world.
In order to rescue his corpse from
the fishes, long boats are manned by
many men, and the first to arrive at
.the goal is supposed to be the fortun
ate savior.

WASHINGTON, June 17.â Secretary
Moody returned to Washington thiÂ»
morning from Massachusetts, where he
has been for several days, and had con
ference with the President and Attor
ney General Knox, at which the retire
ment of the latter and accession of
Moody to his place was discussed.
It is stated that Knox will not be
able to vacate his office to accept the
new appointment as Senator until
about July 1, because of a number of
details which he wishes to see closed
up, so Moody will not take his place
at the head of the Department of Jus
tice until after that date.
Moody al3O discussed with the Presi
dent on the question of his successor,
but as far as can be learned there has
been no decision on this matter, and it
is still in the air.

although it Is believed that General
Stakelberg will continue to retire to
the. northward. It is possible, how
ever, that reinforcements are being
sent to his support. This might be in
ferred from a significant message just
received from one of the* correspond
ents at Tashichia reporting an enor
mous movement of troops, including
cavalry and Infantry, along the rail
road, but the correspondent" Was not
allowed to say in -which direction the
troops were marching. It may ! be
therefore reinforcements moving to
support General Stakelberg or the
force of that commander retiring to
the northward. The message also says
that the whereabouts of Major General
MistcheÂ».ko is not known f\nd this
latter statement may be pregnant with
significance.

Before the expiration of the forty
minutes agreed upon the Russians tor

Colonel Suchi, who was in command
of the troops on board the Hitache, and
many other men committed suicide.
Suchi was educated in France.
The majority of the men on board the
Sado were rescued; the majority on
board the Hitachi were annihilated.
The Sado was not sunk. She floated
east of Okino Island and has been
towed into port.
TOKIO. June 17.â It is impossible to
obtain accurate figures of the losses
sustained by the Japanese as a result
of the sinking of the transport Hitachi
and the shelling of the transport Sado.
A survivor has reported to Vice Ad
miral Hidematsu Teunoda, commander
in chief of the Takeshika Naval Es
tablishment, that the Hitachi was hit
sixty times by the Russian fire and
that the fired on the Russian vessels.
It is suspected that the Russians in
tended shelling the Sado. and a small
boat from this transport pulled over
to the Russian vestel for the purpose of
a parley. The Russians agreed t" give
the men on the Sado forty minutes in
which to get away from their ship, and
said ihey would take the non-combat
ants nn board their own vessels. The
survivor who gives these details de
clares that subsequently the Russians
refused to receive the non-combatants,
with the exception of an Englishman,
who was chief mate of the Sado.

It is believed that Colonel Waters,
the British military attache, was pres
ent during the battle of Vafangow.
The whole regret Is that General
Stakelberg did not draw the Japanese
farther north before allowing them to
engage him, but experts suspect that
certain conditions compelled Stakelberg
to fight at Vafangow.
General Stakelberg is praised for the
skillful handling of his men in the field.
He and his old war comrade, General
Kuropatkin, fought side by side in
Turkestan, and he Insisted on again
taking the field, although almost an In
valid.
ST. PETERSBURG. June . 17.âMili
tary circles do not view the battle of
Vafangow as a defeat, and they con
tend that General Stakelberg, unlike
Lieutenant Zassalitch, won more than
he lost. Whether General Stakelberg's
expedition to the south had an imme
diate bearing on the situation at Port
Arthur, it is thought that his presence
has caused a diversion which will ma
terially affect the operations in the
southern part of the Liaotung Penin
sula. It is thought unlikely that th'e
Japanese had north of Kinchou such,
a large force as that which engaged
Stakelberg's division, and the num
bers seem to indicate that they drew
off some of the troops operating against
Port Arthur. It is pointed out that the
force engaged at Vafangow must re
cuperate for several days, and it is ex
pected that the fight will materially
retard the siege operations against Port
Arthur.

More Than He' Lost.

The young woman sank twice and

LIAOYAXG, June-17. â A press corre
spondent who was present at the battle,
of Vafangow describes the fighting as
follows: - i
"The stern, dogged fighting at the
battle of Vafangow was like another
Borodino. The roar of the machine
guns and the. boom. 'of the cannon still
ring in one's ears. ~
"Throughout the three days of com
bat the officers and men vied with
each other in pluck and heroism. They
have added glorious passages to Rus
sian military, history. . .
"The enemy's advance originally In
cluded the Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh
divisions, twelve squadrons of cavalry
and splendid artillery. About 200 guns
were belching a continuous stream of
shot and shell. Large reinforcements
enabled them to turn the Russian
flanks. A diversion on the right pre
cipitated the battle on the morning of
June 15.
"Major General Gerngross, who was
wounded, commanded the left flank,
and General Loutchkovsky commanded
the center. Including four battalions
concealed in a small wood, whence they
dealt death and destruction on the en
emy. The Russian right was protected
by Cossacks, dragoons and Siberian
Rifles.
THUNDER Op THE BIG GUNS.
"While th^se big guns were thunder
ing I made my way, at about 11 a. m., to
the Russian right flank and climbed a
hill, whence I could view the whole
fit-Id of battle. Behind me a battery had
taken up a position, from which it kept
up a continuous fire upon the advanc
ing ranks of the enemy. Through
glasses I could see the sandy valley of
the Tassa, with the Chinese village of
Vafan.
"The heights of Fuchu. the railway
bridge and the surrounding cops were
occupied by Japanese infantry. Then
*â¢'â¢<â¢(? the retreat. The Japanese shells
were falling , on the station buildings,
from which train - after tra*n ha.2
moved. v
"I descended the hill and Just suc
ceeded in jumping on the footboard
of the last car. Some of the Russian
batteries on the left flank were still
firing. ?The main force then began
slowly to retreat toward Vantslalin
(thirty miles north of Vafangow) and
about 1 in the afternoon had accom
plished its strategic mission. The bat
tle of Vafangow had deflected consid
erable Japanese forces from Port
Arthur.
WENT INTO BATTLE SINGING.
"The fighting was glorious. For
two days the Russian regiments val
orously maintained their positions and
took the offensive on the left, so press
ing the enemy there that a- couple of
Japanese batteries fell into the Cos
sacks' hands. The Russian soldiers
went into battle singing, their spirits
not affected by the fierce heat and
furious cannonading, whose, intensity
may be gauged from the influence It
had on the atmospheric conditions.
Rain drops fell like tears at the height
of the battle, although the day dawn
ed clear.
"Many Russians have fallen, but a
greater . number of Japanese were
killed. The Russian shells and bullets
mowed, tHem down like wheat. The
whole valley was bestrewn with the
corpses and the river Tafesa ran red.
But it was with Japanese" more than
with Russian blood.
"I left on the last train with Gen
eral Stakelberg. This train collided
with the one preceding it near Vant
sialin, but it was not damaged.
"When passing Kaichou we saw
three Japanese cruisers.
"The railroad north was ocupled by*
Russian troops. The Russians say
that the Japanese cannot "advance
much further north, even when they
recover from the effects of the battle
of Vafangow."
black lines of infantry, like threads,
could be seen creeping through the ver
dure. Nearer the slope of a hill was
dotted by the, gray shirts of the Rus
sian riflemen. A brownish smoke over
hung some of the batteries, and others
showed flashes of flames. The crackle
of rifle fire/was punctuated by the roar
of 'guns. Occasionally I heard the hiss
of a Japanese bullet.
"The scene was awe-inspiring. Over
the Russian. center and left flank hov
ered chocolate clouds from bursting
shrapnel. It. was evident that the tide
of battle was coming toward the Rus
sian right. I saw reserves . hurrying
forward, the Cossacks galloping, fol
lowed by. columns of infantry. Sud
denly they disappeared in an adjacent
defile. Tne valley -where the Russians
had camped . was emptied as if by
magic.
RETIRE IX GOOD ORDER.'
"Rattling volleys ' were fired behind
the screen of hills which concealed the
fighting troops from view in that direc
tion, the sound of the firing being. the
only evidence .of the deadly struggle
proceeding there. This continued for
half an hour." Suddenly a company of
Cossacks appeared on the crest of a
hill and began to descend. They were
followed by Infantry. The Japanese
gunners promptly pursued them with
shrapnel. Horses and men began fall-
Ing.
"A moment of harrowing suspense
was relieved by a shout of 'HurrahJ,'
was from a couple of thousand
Russian troops just brought up by
train. They quickly jumped from the
cars, fixed bayonets and literally ran
into the fight.
"Again the crackle of musketry un

The flames were confined by flooding
the ship with water to a single com
partment In the after part of the ship.
The steerage berths and woodwork
were eaten away, but so far as exam
ination this morning shows none of the
steel frames or plates of the vessel were
warped. The fire originated in this part
of the steerage, but investigation has
yet failed to reveal the cause.
The Ohio was built in Philadelphia In
1S73. Her gross tonnage is 3438. She
Is 343 feet long. 43 feet beam and 24.9
feet deep. For many years the Ohio
ran out of New York, and at one time
was one of the greyhounds of the At
lantic. In 1S9S the Empire Transporta
tion Company, former owners of the
ship, sent her around the Horn with
the Indiana, Conemaugh and Pennsyl
vania, and entered them In the trans
port service out of San Francisco.
In 1909 the Ohio was placed on the
Nome run and continued in that service
until this spring, when she was pur
chased by the Moran Brothers' Com
pany, who contemplated spending $100.
000 in refitting and repairing the vessel.
SEATTLE. June 17.â The damage to
the steamship Ohio, which caught fire
at Moran's shipyards shortly after mid
night, is estimated at between $20,000
and $25,000. *
TOKIO, June 17.â Details Is connec
tion with the sinking of the Japanese
tiansport Hitachi by Russian warships
are being furnished by survivors. The
Russian ships were sighted at 7 o'clock
in the morning and in response to a
signal the Hitachi was stopped, but at
10 o'clock got under way again and at
tempted to escape. The Russians fol
lowed and opened a heavy fire directed
about the water line with the evident
intention of destroying the troops on
board. The fire was terrific and In a
few minutes the decks were covered
with corpses and awash with blood.
One shell which struck the engine room
killed two hundred men. The shio be
gan to fill and sunk gradually by the
stern. At 6 o'clock in the evening she
was completely submerged. Captain
Campbell, the English master of the
transport, jumped overboard at 2
o'clock in the afternoon and Is num
bered among the missing.
The chief engineer was killed on the
bridge. The' commander of the troops
ordered the flag to be burned and
then killed himself. The second mate
committed suicide. Many of the crew
and troops escaped in the boats.
The transport Sado is badly dam
aged. She sighted the Russian ships
thirty-five miles west of Shiro Island.
Their signals to stop were unheeded,
so the Russians opened fire and signal
ed for those on board the Sado to
leave the ship. Upon that the crew
took to the boats and in this way
many escaped when the ship was
eventually fired by the enemy.
The 4 number of men on board the
two transports and the list of casual
ties are not as yet obtainable.
"The Russian artillery." the lieuten
ant says, "was splendidly served, but
was outmatched in number by the Jap
anese. One Russian battery pitted
airninÂ«t Japanese batteries was literally
smothered by Japanese shells.
"I saw one battery land three shells
in the midst of an ammunition train
which was galloping up to serve the
Japanese guns. Two caissons explod
ed, killing all the horses and drivers.
"The Japanese guns fired at least
1200 rounds. The Russians fired several
times on Japanese infantry in close
formation, causing tremendous havoc."
An officer of the Fourth Battery 8Â«ys
his battery was in a duel at two and
a half miles with a Japanese battery
and silenced it. His battery then ran
out of ammunition and the men carried
the breech mechanism of the guns with
them to the rear and brought up a
fresh supply of ammunition and' re
sumed serving the guns.
Several of the Russian dead found
in the bushes were horribly mutilated.
The foreign attaches drew up a formal
memorandum of this.
LI AO YANG, June 17.â The wounded
in the first two days' fighting at
Vafangow- are arriving. A lieutenant
of Cossacks says the American military
attaches were with his command most
of June 15 during the hottest part of
thÂ«r fight. He commented upon their

CALL BUREAU, WORLD'S FAIR.
ST. LOUIS, June 17.â The commission
ers from the California counties to the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition will
give an opening. It will take place In
California's space In the Palace of Ag
riculture, and the custodians of the
county exhibits hope to make it the
vehicle for a good advertisement for
the State. The final touches are being
put on the exhibits in the California
section, and the general display will be
in Its fairest form when the reception
Is given. -The county commissioners'
organization will have the floor in the
entire space oiled, which will give a
better appearance to the section, now a
small fair In Itself and filled with va
ried beauties. There will be music at
the reception, as planned now, and an
nouncements will be made in the St.
Louis papers so as to draw the largest
crowd possible and make the occasion
a noteworthy one. All Californlans
will be invited to be present with
badges displayed and receive the vis
itors and furnish information required
by them. The State commissioners will
be asked to select a date for the open-
Ing. The expense will be paid by the
counties' organization.
A fund for local advertising has also
been raised by the county commission
ers, and fair visitors will be informed
through various sources that the most
wonderful exhibit of the soil's products
ever gathered together on the face of
the globe is to be seen In the California
section of the Palaces of Agriculture
and Horticulture. The object is to make
the California displays in these build
ings objects that "must be seen" by
visitors who wish to see the fair's main
features.

The Pike parties of Miss Alice

mining exhibit commissioner, is out

side display.
In the horticultural section New Mex
ico Is making a demonstration of the
early maturity of her apples that is
novel. Every fifteen days specimens
enough to fill a glass Jar are received
from an orchard near Roswell and
placed on exhibition... The first con
signment, consisting of eight varieties,
was received on April 23. These are
about as large as pigeon eggs and
from this the apples will take- their
gradual steps to full and appetizing
maturity. Fruits and cereals with all
the beauty brought by perpetual sun
shine on irrigated lands are shown by
the Territory.
The "fadies â¢ of New Mexico have
taken an active part in making the
exhibit attractive. The Women's Board
of Trade of Santa Fe has contributed
for the main reception room of the
building a costly filigree table that is
the delight of every lady visitor who
sees it. This table, which is kept in
a glass case, is made of gold and sil
ver and the precious stones found In
the Territory. Silver plate, lace and
other fabrics, all of ancient make,
have been contributed by the Lady
Managers' Auxiliary. There is one lady
manager from each county, appointed
by the gallant Governor Otero and the
board selected Miss Otero for its presi
dent. She has placed an exhibit in the
New Mexico building that, while it has
nothing In particular to do with New
Mexico, draws many curious people. It
Is the coat worn .by Aguinaldo when
he was captured. It Is an ordinary,
white duck garment, such as an Amer
ican barber might wear and was pre
sented to Mrs. Otero by an officer who
was present at the capture and se
cured It.
The Territory's ethnological exhibit
fills all of room 111 In the Anthropol
ogy building, 32x45 feet. A display
of basketry and blanketry is made
that is attracting the attention of
many scientific men.
Of the two bells mentioned, both
were brought from Spain in the fif
teenth century by the Franciscans.
One had been cast many years before.
In them are said to be much gold and
silver that once were ornaments and
many Jewels,; all cast into the molten
metal by the faithful as an earnest of
their devotion. One was used in an
old mission near Santa Fe and belongs
to the New Mexico Historical Society.
The other was found in the ruins of
the Grand Quiveras In Southern New
Mexico. It was recently discovered
by Governor Otero, who borrowed It
for the exposition. It is the one that
was pealing In Spain before Columbus
sailed first

The deceased was a member of the

SAN JOSE, June 17.â John L. Stock,
the senior member of the firm of John
Stock Sons, plumbers and tinners, died
this morning at his home at 117 Vine

years and his death has not been un
expected during the past week. He
was a native of Chicago and 54 years
of aee.
John L. Stock Succumbs to an Illness
Lasting O\-er a Period of
Two Years.
The news has been received here of
the death in Cologne on May 8 of
Baroness Ella von Wrede, wife of
Baron Hermann von Wrede and
mother of the Baroness Ray von
Wrede and Mrs. William B. Brandon.
formerly Kuhr.e Beveridge, the sculp
tor, who is living with her husband in
Johannesburg, South Africa. Death
was due to appendicitis.
The late Baroness was fprmerly
Mrs. Philo Beveridge of Springfield,
111. Ten years ago, after the death of
Be\-eridge, she met and married the
Baron von Wrede in this city.
Baroness von Wrede was well
known In this city, where for a num
ber of year?, during her many ad
versities, she struggled hard to main
tain hersolf and daughter and give the
latter an opportunity to develop her
talent as a sculptor. Her marriage to
Baron von Wrede brought her only
on empty title, for her husband was
without financial means and, in or
der to support his wife, was com
pelled to accept a position as clerk in
the old Baldwin Hotel. Later the
Baron and Baroness went East, where
Kuhne Beveridge realized her ambi
tion in gaining fame in her art, but in
the zenith of her fame she married
and was soon forgotten here.

Chretien became suspicious and then told
mÂ«> that the Van Dlven account should i><*
$491 Instead of the amount first stated. This
slip caused Chretien's downfall. HÂ» was put
under a vigorous interrogation, but denied
that he fcrsed Van Dlven 1 a name. He ex
plained the order by saying he found It on
his desk. He could not tell who put it there
or anything more about It. I had Chretien
sent Into the Jute mill forthwith.
We probably would have known nothing
about it had not Van Dlven complained. Of
course he did not get the actual coin, but
would no doubt have done Â«o after Van Dlven
left San Quentin. I was always suspicious of
this fellow Chretien, and. In fact, often
watched him closely In various transactions,
but had no direct evidence and could not get
it. He Is now In a place where he cannot do
any more such work. Ilia credits have not
yet been taken away. He had one of the best
positW is held by any convict.
John M. Chretien was for a long time
clerk in the turnkey's office. Subse
quently he was promoted to head book
keeper at the prison.
A convict named Carl Van Dlven. doing Â»tx
years for burglary, was paroled May 14,
Van Dlven had $491 to his credit. According
to prison accounts he had only $441. He was
$50 ehort. I investigated and found an order
signed ty Van Diven for $50. It was shown
him, but he stoutly denied ever having signed
the order. Captain Swan, who has control of
the convict cash, claimed to know nothing
about it.
Chretien was deprived of his easy
berth as head accountant of the prison
and now suffers the ignominy of work
ing alongside of the most desperate
characters' in the Jute mill. In all
probability he will be required to wear
prison garb for the entire remaining
period of his term. The matter will
be taken up by the State Board of
Prison Directors to-morrow morning.
From circumstances surrounding the
case will not only be denied parole,
but will be deprived of over threa
years' credits.
Chretien cam* to San Quentin De
cember 13, 1900. With credits he would
leave San Quentin the last part of this
year. He will not now be liberated
until June 30, 1907.
Warden Tompklns when Interviewed
tp-nlght, said:
Chretien was sent up for forgery
committed In San Francisco In De
cember, 1900. With only a short time
to serve and with fine chances of being
paroled within a few months, he has
signed another man's name. This time
he attempted to deprive a fellow con
vict of $30 sent him by relatives. By
the merest accident the little game was
foiled.
SAN QUENTIN, June 17.â While
serving a ten-year sentence for forgery-
John M. Chretien has committed the
same crime inside the prison walls for
which he was convicted as a free man.
He has made a fac simile of a signature,
and by so doing came very near obtain
ing a sum of money from a fellow
convict.
Special DlÂ»r*tch to Tho Call.
The committee then adjourned until
10 o'clock Monday morning, all the con
tests before it having been settled.
Senator Scott of West Virginia to
day issued the 'following, which may
have significance in view of the fact
that Senator Scott has been quoted as
being a candidate for the chairman
ship of the national committee:
"I think that the precedent of the
party should be and will be followed
in the 'selection of a chairman an<5
that the wishes of the candidate for
President will be followed. I am not
informed as to what the President's
wishes are, but we must go into the
campaign united behind the chairman,
whoever he Is."
A resolution was passed to the effect
that the members of the Republican
National Committee from all the States
and Territories and the District of Co
lumbia are instructed to call a meet-
Ing of their respective delegations for
a time not later than the evening of
Monday, June 20, for the selection of
members of the various convention
committees.
A long list of minor employes such
as doorkeepers, reading clerks and
pages was adopted, as reported by the
sub-committee.
While the contest is practically
settled eo far as the national conven
tion Is concerned, the dispute among
the two factions of Wisconsin Repub
licans is not ended. Wisconsin courts
are tp be asked to determine which of
the two State conventions recently
held In Wisconsin was entitled to have
the names cf its nominees for State of
ficers placed on the official ballot under
the regular party name.
The "stalwarts' " delegates at large
who are seated are Senator John C.
Spooner, Senator Joseph V. Quarles,
Congressman J. W. Babcock and Emil
Baensch.
After the national committee had de
cided against the supporters of the
Governor from Wisconsin, the leaders
isi the La Follette side announced their
determination to carry their fight to
the end and it Is probable that in spite
of the decision of the committeemen
that the dispute will again be fought
out befcrre the committee on creden
tials in the national convention.
Missouri and Texas contests were de
cided, in the latter State the Lyon fac
tion winning the delegates at large.
The committee affirmed the report of
the sub-committee in the selection of
temporary officers for the convention.
These will be Charles' W. Johnson of
Minneapolis, secretary; John R. Malloy
of Ohio, first assistant secretary; Elihu
Root, temporary chairman; William E.
Stone, sergeant at arms; David C.
Owens, Milwaukee, first assistant ser
geant at arms.
CHICAGO, June 17.â By unanimous
vote the Republican National Commit
tee decided to seat the delegates at
large from Wisconsin, who are mem
bers of the "stalwart" faction, headed
by United States Senators John C.
Spooner and Joseph V. Quarles and
opposed to the Republicans led by Gov
ernor Robert La Follette.

Earthquake. Shock at Callstoga.

shock of earthquake was felt here this

were from. east to west. No damage
is reported. ' , [ : â¢ .
NEW YORK, June 17.â The sentiment
in Wall street to-day was largely influ
enced by the attitude assumed by the
stockholders of the Southern Pacific
and others toward the financial plan
recently/announced. A further discus
sion and reflection on the proposals of
the j Southern Pacific management
seemed to demonstrate pretty clearly
the fact that the plan to raise J JO, 000,000
in cash by the sale of 7 per cent pre
ferred stock, and the right to authorize
an issue of JlOO.OOQ.OOi}, has not been fa
vorably received: This sentiment was
evidenced by liquidation in Southern
Pacific, which affected the entire mar
ket.
The fact that the Southern Pacific
Company reserved the right to redeem
the preferred stock at 115 within a pe
riod of five years after July 1. 1905,
brought about a decided change in the
estimated status of the new preferred
stock, as well as the rights accruing
on present stock. It was quite gener
ally believed that the new stock would
sell above 115, but the redemption
clause carried with it the conviction
that the new stock would sell some
where between that figure and 120. The
course of the rights on the curb, where
they are now traded in. together with
the decline in the stock to 117. con
firmed the general impression. The
suggestion was also made that no mat
ter what refunding process was put
into operation the new preferred stock
would probably be funded into bonds.

Slayer Alleges Self-Defense for a
Crime Committed on the North

APHLAND, Or., June 17.â News has
reached here of a tragedy at Picard.
in Butte Creek Valley, California. ea3t

young man of Ashland, wa.i shot and
killed, and his companion, named Mc-
Kay, seriously wounded by a man
named Snyder at a cabin near the

Klamath County, and gave himself up
to the officers, claiming that the shoot
ing was dene in defense of his property.
The report is being persistently cir
culated in local railroad and financial
circles that the recent incorporation of
a company to build a six-mile road
from Oakdale, the southern terminus
of the Sierra Railway, to Riverbank, a
station on the line of the Santa Fe, is
the forerunner of a bigger deal, involv
ing the transfer of ownership of the
Sierra Railway. x
According to the information now in
the possession of men of finance, Wil
liam R. Thorsen of Wisconsin, head of
the syndicate which purchased the
West Side Lumber Company's plant in
Tuelumne County two years ago and
has Just incorporated the company
which will build the road from Oakdale
to Riverbank. has secured an option
on the Sierra Railway property. It Is
claimed that Thorsen, since he first
came to California two years ago, has
been quietly working for the Santa Fe
Company with a view of securing for
it a foothold in the big timber dis
tricts in Tuolumne and adjacent coun
ties, and while engineering this scheme
he took advantage of an opportunity
to purchase the West Side Lumber
Company's interests.
RIPLEY STEALS A MARCH.
About a year ago a company, in
which Thorsen is said to have been the
backer, incorporated for the purpose
of building a road from a point on the
Sierra Railway to Claus, a station of
the Santa Fe. The attempts of the
company to secure rights of way were
thwarted by the Southern Pacific It
was then that Thorsen, acting under
advice of the president and other lead
ing officials of the Santa Fe. under
took another project and before the
Southern Pacific Company realized the
fact the newly incorporated company,
known N as the Oakdale and Western
Railroad, had obtained the necessary
rights of way between Riverbank and
Oakdale and "let Its contract for grad
ing. Before accomplishing this much,
however, Thorsen had been dealing
witlulhe stockholders of the Sierra
Railway and obtained an option in his
Own name, but which, in reality. Is for
the Santa Fe Company.
THORSEN HURRIES EAST.
The option guarantees Thorsen con
trol of the road as soon as he has
made a sufficient financial advance
ment on the major portion of the stock
that is bonded to him and to carry out
this object he is now in the East.con
ferring with the representatives of
the Santa Fe. During the progress of
the recent deal Thorsen "made his head
quarters at the Palace Hotel and was
dally in conference with Captain A. H.
Payson at the local offices of the Santa
Fe read. The Sierra Railway is a val
uable acquisition to the Santa Fe in
that it gives it a rich field in which
to operate, and guarantees it a large
share of the lumber traffic which orig
inates in the Tuolumne timber dis
trict.
"As Secretary of the Department of
Commerce and Labor, I am the head
of the Federal inquiry into this' af
fair and I propose to give it my per
sonal and in so far as possible my un
divided attention until the matter- Is
finally settled. As soon as practicable
the Board of Inspectors will get to
gether and take testimony. This in
quiry will be separate and distinct
from any proceedings brought by city,
State or county officials. V* V"
CORTELYOU TO INVESTIGATE.
"I want to correct an impression
that seems to have gone abroad that
this investigation will be left to sub
ordinates in the department. This. is
absolutely untrue. I will hold the in
quiry myself and will have ample as
sistance from the most prominent and
efficient men in the department.
Every one who can throw the least
light upon the matter will be brought
before the board and the taking of
testimony will continue so long as any
one can be found who can aid us in
arriving at a correct estimate of the
facts. The sittings of the board will
continue until the whole . truth is
known." . .
While the divers and others were
busy looking for- bodies to-day the
steamer Grand Republic, . the sister
ship of the General Slocum, parsed- up
the river with a party of excursionists
on board. Every , deck was crowded.
As .the vessel. neared the point where
the divers were working on the wreck-
"I wish to say that a most thorough
investigation will be made into the
most awful tragedy and that no stone
will be left unturned to lay bare the
whole truth with regard to it.
Secretary Cortelyou, who had a long
conference with Robert S. Rodie, in
spector of the Second District of
New York, after his arrival here, said
to-day that he would give his per
sonal attention to the Federal investi
gation of the Slocum disaster. Mr.
Cortelyou said:
The distressing concentration of the
blow of the disaster is shown by the
fact that in one apartment house on
Eighth street there are thirty-five
dead, while in a Rivington-street house
sixteen bodies await burial. '
Preliminary steps ,have been taken
for three distinct investigations of the
disaster. These are being undertaken
by the Federal authorities through the
Department of Commerce, by the Coro
ner's office and by the District Attor
ney. The Coroner's inquest will begin
on .Monday next and Captain Van
Schaick- of the Slocum and six of his
crew lie in a hospital with a police
man at the bedside of each. They are
at present detained as witnesses. The 1
authorities are rapidly gathering such
evidence as will be needed in ascertain
ing whether or "not there -was neglect
or carelessness in the safety appli
ances of the vessel.' First Officer Ed
ward Flanagan of the Slocum is quoted
in an Interview as saying that the
steamer's flre hose, was rotten and use
less and that it burst in a dozen places
when he and his men tried-to use it.
The charge Is also made that the life
preservers on the vessel were old and
rotten and in most instances proved in
adequate when used. Several papers
to-day print pictures of preservers
taken from the Slocum which bear in
black letters this inscription:
"Passed by United States Steamboat
Inspector, June 18, 1891."
BOATS FASTENED BY WIRES.
William Thembly, a deckhand, cor
roborates Flanagan's statement regard
ing the defective fire hose and it is re
ported that evidence has been secured
showing that some of the life boats
were made fast by wires, making it
impossible for them to be cast loose
and lowered. All the men who have
made these statements will be called
as witnesses by the Coroner.
Police boats and other, harbor craft.
still maintain their patrol of the waters
of the East River in the vicinity of the
accident in the hope of recovering
bodies.
NEW YORK, Juno 17.â Forty-eight
hours after the burning of the steamer
General Slocum the exact number of
victims is still unknown. Up to the
rresent time the total number of
bodies recovered is 560, and of these
Â£21 have been identified. With no more
arrivals at the Morgue for several
hours, hope began to be felt that^tho
awful total had been completed, but it
was soon shattered by a report that
divers at work on the hulk of the Slo
cum had discovered a mass of bodies
wedged in one of the paddle boxes.
How many corpses there will prove to
be in this place will not be known for
some hours, as they will not be dis
turbed until the Coroner is on the
scene. One hopeful phase of the sit
uation is the steady decrease in the
number of missing, though it is still
appallingly large, the number being
somewhere between 400 and 500. The
various officials whose positions brings
them into touch with the disaster still
adhere to the belief that when all is
tojd it will be found that between 900
and 1000 persons perished.
The sad' task of burying the dead
began to-day. A meeting of the Ger
man Lutheran ministers of the city
was held and a programme of services
arranged. While in many instances a
Joint service will be held over several
bodies, nevertheless the clergymen of
this denomination have a herculean
task before them in administering the
last rites over the dead of their faith.

At various hospitals where the in
jured are It was said to-day their con
dition is satisfactory. There are now
only 53 victims of the disaster In the
hospitals.
It developed to-day that a new hor
ror had been added to the terrible con
ditions resulting from the Slocum dis
aster through the over-offlciousness of
some person at the Morgue. Asa re
sult some of the bodies probably never
will be identified and will go to a last
resting place in the humble plat fur
nished by the city's charity. When the
bodies were taken by hundreds from
the water and laid in rows on the grass
at North Brother Island each was tag
ged with a number. That number was
carefully recorded and" the papers, val
uables and trinkets which would have
served to positively identify the bodies
were removed and placed In separate
packages, each package bearing a
number corresponding to the number
on the body from which the articles
were taken. These packages then were
placed in the custody of the Coroner.
Scores of the bodies at the Morgue
were burned or bruised beyond recog
nition, but it was hoped that all might
be claimed by friends by means of the
papers and Jewelry. ,
When the bodies were taken to the
Morgue they were placed in numbered
boxes, but in many cases these num
bers did not correspond with the fig
ures the bodies had previously borne.
As a result the plans were completely
upset and the numbered packages of
valuables became practically worthless
aB a means of identifying the owners.
MORGUE RECORDS INCOMPLETE.
One case which came to the attention
of the officials to-day was that of A.
T. Hill of Wllllamsburg. Hill called
at the morgue yesterday and Identified
the bodies of his brother-in-law, Will
iam RIchter, and the wife of the lat
ter, and they were removed to the of
fice of an undertaker. In the afternoon
the bodies of Catherine and .Lillian
Richter, 3 and 4 years old, respectively,'
also.' were identified by hi: . When he
called at the morgue to-day with an
undertaker who was to attend to the
burial of the bodies they could not be
found. The bodies were, numbered 173
and X75 respectively and the authorities
at the morgue - have no record of any
such bodies, having been given to any
one, though they had a record of iden
tification made by, HilJ yesterday.
It. is thought: that, some undertaker
was given the bodies in place of two
others which he .'should have taken,
INJURED ARE IMPROVING.
Discussions as to the best means for
preventing such disasters have brought
out expressions, of opinion by several
leading shipbuilders and naval archi
tects that it Is easily possible to con-
Btruct vessels of the type of the Gen
eral Slocum In such a way as to make
them comparatively safe. These ex
perts believe the free use of steel in
the construction of the upper works
would Involve a greater expense than
builders of excursion craft .are ready
to Incur. They believe that a safe boat
constructed with bulkheads, corru
gated Iron partitions and fireproof ma
terials, might be built for about 20 to
30 per cent more than the cost of a
wooden vessel such as the General Slo
cum. . . ... ;. .
One leading; constructor expressed
the idea that every vessel should have
bulkheads j of light double plating,
filled with asbestos. These should
so fitted that they could be swung
or dropped across certain parts of the
steamer when necessary without ob
structing free passage at other times.
All machinery should be incased m
metal to the top deck. Decks should
be supported by metal framework and
fireproof materials wherever possible.
Inflammable stuff, he. said, should be
barred. , >
Divers had explored the wreck of
the steamer yesterday and reported
that no iriore bodies were. to be found
there, but to-day a diver who was at
work on the sunken hull found a large
number of bodies packed tightly inside
one of the paddle wheels.
Nearly all of the bodies recovered
yesterday were "found in the mud close
to the westerly shore of North Brother
Island, where the Slocum was fir3t
beached and where hundreds went to
their death.
DISCUSSING THE DISASTER.

Story That for a Time
Causes Gunst Uneasiness
By F. W. BISHOP.

ON BOARD CALIFORNIA DELE
GATION'S SPECIAL TRAIN, OMAHA,
Neb., June 17. â Governor Pardee's pen
chant fur practical Jokes and the him
csty of Colonel Kowalsky's colored
volet. Bob Jackson, served to enliven
for a time to-day the wearying trav
elers.
In the first instance the Governor let
it be noised about that he was en
gaged in endeavoring to create an op
position to M. A. Gunst, who seeks to
represent California on the committee
that will formally notify Roosevelt of
his nomination. As soon as Gunst's
discomfiture was manifested to a de
gree satisfactory to all concerned, an
nouncement was made that the Gov
ernor was only indulging in his desire
to joke. Then Gunst opened the wine.
The incident in which Kowalsky's
valet was the '"honest hero" happened
this way. Bob was directed by the Col
onel to leave the train during the stop
at Cheyenne and file a telegram.
When the train was about to pull out
It was said that Bob was not on the
station platform and it was necessary
to delay the start until he could be
located.
Finally he was found in his em
ployer's drawing-room.
"Why didn't you tell me you got
back so we could start?" said the con
ductor, angrily.
"Because Ah didn't got back. Ah
never did <go," answered Bob. "Ah
found diamonds." In Bob's ebony hand
ten diamonds sparkled. He had found
them on a car step as he was leaving
to file the telegram.^
The find took his breath, he forgot his
mission and returned to the Colonel's
compartment to report his luck. An
investigation disclosed the fact that
the gems were the property of Mrs. Dr.
Karsner of Oroville. She had not dis
covered the loss until announcement
was made that the sparklers had been
found. Then, in her excitement, she
rewarded the Pullman porter, but
"right will prevail" and a "committee"
was appointed to see that the porter
disgorged in favor of Bob.
For hundreds of miles the train has
sped to-day across the rolling prairie
land of Wyoming, fresh with the show
ers of early summer, and through the
green fields and woods of Nebraska.
All of the delegates, undisturbed by
politics, the only important question,
that of national commltteeman, having
been settled in favor of Knight, settled
down and enjoyed to the fullest extent
the refreshing change from the desert
of Nevada and the dusty heights of
Utah.
The sDeed of the train has been tre
mendous to-day. Between Green River,
Wyo., and Omaha more than sixty
miles an hour was maintained, eighty
eight miles an hour being the maximum
attained. The train reached Green
River two hours and forty-five minutes
behind schedule, but arrived here at
8:45 o'clock, twenty-five minutes ahead
of schedule. This time was made up in
a* distance of 825 miles, and every one
admits that it was a great feat in rail
roading.
To-morrow at 10 a. m. Chicago will
be reached. Elaborate preparations for
the entry of the delegates Into the city
have been made. Carriages will be in
waiting, a brass band will be ready,
and when the Auditorium is reached
the East will know without mistake
that the Farthest West has come to
cast its vote for Roosevelt.
The delegations from Hawaii, the
Philippines and Nevada will join Cali
fornia in the parade, but when the
Auditorium is reached the Nevada
delegation will depart for independent
and unattached headquarters in the
Great Northern Hotel, as befits an in
dependent, sovereign State. _ '

LIVERXASII TALKS. \
The Iroquols Club gave an Informal
reception last night to Congressman E.
J. Llvernash at Pythian Castle. The
hall was well filled with the members
of the club and many outsiders.
After a short introductory speech
by William H. Kline, president of the
club, â¢ Mr. Livernash Â¦ started in by
giving a few experiences in Congress.
Soon, however, he branched to capital
and labor. He scored the monopolies
and declared that the workingman's
salvation lies in labor unions and the
voting of the Democratic ticket. His
closing remarks reviewed the work of
the Democratic party, which he said
was "wrong once in a while, and some
times entirely wrong (being a human
institution), but whose maxim is, the
greatest good for the greatest num
ber."
The executive committee of the Re
publican State Central Committee met
last night at party headquarters. Pal
ace Hotel, and framed a call to be pre-
Bented for adoption at a meeting of
the general committee to-day. It Is
recommended that the delegates to the
State Convention assemble on Thurs
day. August 25. The Impression pre
vails that the committee meeting in
the Palace Maple room to-day will des
ignate Santa Cruz as the place for
liolding the convention. The appor
tionment adopted is the same as that
vhich applied to the May convention of
the party, or one delegate for e-Â£h 200
votes cast for Governor Pardee in 1902
and one Oelegate for a majority frac
tion thereof. This will create a
convention of 734 delegates. The
Lumber accredited to San Francisco
is 121. apportioned as follows to
the respective Assembly districts:
Twenty-eighth. 5; Twenty-ninth, 5;
Thirtieth. 6; Thirty-first, 5; Thirty
second, S; Thirty-third, 3; Thirty

In San Francisco, Oakland, Los An
peles. Sacramento, San Diego, Stock
ton. Alameda, Berkeley, Fresno, Pasa
dena, Yallejo and the county of Santa
Clara the delegates are to be chosen
under the provisions of the primary
election law on Tuesday, August 9. In
counties or Assembly districts where
the provisions of the primary law are
not mandatory delegates may be ap
pointed or elected in such manner as
may be determined by the respective
county committees. The test to be re
quired of a voter is a "bona ride pres

COXGHESS AND LEGISLATURE.
With reference to Congressional and
legislative nominations the call can
t-ins these requirements:
That *hfrÂ» no petition shall have b**n filed

Ceorg- Stone, chairman; E. F. Wood
ward, secretary; James K. Wilson,
treasurer; Robert T. Devlin, P. S. Tel

The convention will nominate Presi
dential Electors to be voted for at the
general election, Tuesday, November 8,
1904.
The subject of registration engaged
the attention of the committee for a
considerable length of time last night.
According to a decision of the Supreme
Court, deputies or clerks employed by
County Clerks to register voters can
not be paid from funds of the county,
hence party clubs may be urged to
aseiBt in bringing about a complete
registration cf voters.
McNAB AND TARPEY.
The new Democratic State Central
Committee v.iJl meet for organization
In the California Hotel at 1 p. "m. to
day. Lively times are expected, as a
fight is on between Gavin McXab and
M. F. Tarpey for possession of the
â¢uorks. The McXab forces will support
William J. McGee of San Francisco for
chairman. Tarpey's followers will line
up for M. F. Cochrane of San Rafael.
A battle for the secretaryship is also
foreshadowed. Last night the leaders
cf each faction were confident of suc
crEf. It remains to be seen whether
Frank H. Gould, chairman of the late
Eanta Cruz convention, or Barney Mur
phy, chairman of the old State Central
Committee, will call the meeting to or
der. Comments of this kind were made
in the "organisation" camps last night:
"McNab would not be so absolutely
cure of winning out if he had not gone
over the roll carefully and ascertained
beyond doubt that a majority will vote
lor McGee."
In the Hearst camp it waa said:
"Tarpey would not be so positive of
Cochrane's election if he had not gone
flown the line and checked every mem
ber of the committee."
The Democrats may resolve to hold

begin "operations early in July.
During the year ending June 30,' 1903,
the Yukon, territory produced gold to
the value of $12,113,015. The production
of the preceding year was $9,566,340. The
gold . output for >the first mentioned
year was greater than that of any in
the history of the district, the next in
record making being the year of 1899
1900, when the output amounted to $9,
809,464. The large output of last year
was due to the abundance^of water.
The figures relative to the gold produc

The argument for the peddlers was

Murphy appeared for the Commission
ers and Luther/Elkins for the city.
Superior Judge Hunt yesterday heard
arguments and took under submission
the case of William Kamelakls against
the Park Commissioners and the Chief
of Police. The plaintiff is a peddler
and in his suit represents other ped
dlers who seek. to annul the order of
the Park Commissioners excluding
them from plying theii^' business on
the ocean beach, particularly near the
Cliff House. The peddlers contend
that they, solicit trade between high
and low tide and that their ground is
not within the juriwliction of the* Park
Commission. The Commission argues
that the map filed in I860 shows that
the highway extends to the lap of the
water, otherwise, . westward from a
given point, to the Pacific Ocean.^ The

claimed he hud attempted to strangle
her, but she was convicted of assault

Shortly before 9 o'clock Gagan-en
tered the room of Pauline Pepin in
Bacon place and was leaving with a
bundle under his arm when he was
seen by some of the other women, who
raised an alarm. Gagan fled and dur
ing his flight dropped the bundle in
front of the California Hotel. It con
tained several silk wrappers belong

Policeman Grunwald was notified
and while he was searching for Gagan
an alarm of fire was turned in from

Grunwald hurried to that corner and
found Gagan, who had turned in the
alarm, in charge of W. Hartnup, a pri

According to Mr. Brzezinski's theory
he was the victim of a modern arrange

to have been in active operation long
before the gold brick swindle was first
sprung upon the PomDeilans. He was
entertaining in his apartment a young
lady from an adjacent dance hall who
had manifested preference for his so
ciety when the door was rudely burst
open and two men, believed to be the
defendants, rushed in, and after chid
ing his gallantry relieved him of $360
cash, a watch and chain and three
boxes of cigars. Several detectives and
others gave testimony that served to
help the prosecution, and the defense
will have its inning next Monday.
Miss Raynee Langford, the lady in
the case, haughtily denied collusion
w,jth the defendants, and also tried to
make It appear that her visit to Mr.
Brzezinski's chamber was not volun
tary, as he had insinuated. She went
there, she said, to call upon his two
daughters, each of whom presides over

of Justice with bonds for Brennan's
release. | He was followed by Bren

an order signed by Judge Fritz, who
had accepted the bonds.
Cannon denied emphatically that any
attempt at compromise had come from

finish. He supposed that Hassett,
after reflection, had concluded it was
inadvisable to proceed with the case.

a felony?"
Hassett disclaimed any such inten

Judge Gesford of Napa, sitting in de

marked that he would like to 6ee any

so angered the foreman that he went
to the front office and notified Mr.

to where the intruder coolly awaited
expulsion and at once expelled him.
Mr. Toomey averred that unnecessary
violence was used in his removal, as
he was pitched headlong down a stair

RECENT OPERATIONS.
Operators of other sorts of mines
may be interested in seeing the â¢ offi
cial returns of the cost of producing
52,538,614 worth of borax. There was
paid out In salaries for the year 1902
the sum of $18,128; for wages, $114,863;
for miscellaneous expenses, $47,606; for
supplies and material, $213,538. The
total cost, as represented by ttlese fig
ures, for producing 19,142 tons of borax
was 5394,137 t> or at the rate of a frac
tion more than $20 per ton.
This high cost may be largely at
tributed to the distance of borax de
posits from bases of supplies and mar
kets, necessitating teaming over long
reaches of deserts in a temperature
and under circumstances extremely
trying.

States, and the total value of the
product- was but $25,750, the quantity
produced being but 1245 short tons.
Lepidolite constituted more than 70
per cent of the total output. The Geo
logical Survey slightly raises the
amount of lithium minerals mined to
1750 tons, worth $43,200.
Growing out of a generous offer on
the part of, George Crocker j of San

The census returns never have dealt
separately with borax until the cen
sus to which allusion is made in this
article. Since the beginning of the
borax mining industry In California
the output has varied from nothing in
18C9, 1870 and 1871 to 19,142 short tons
in 1902. The value of borax produced
in California is treated separately by

representing the value of the output;
for 1902 they are $2,538,614.
COST OP BORAX MINING.
Some interesting facts may be glean
ed from a bewildering array of sta
tistical tables relating to the growth
of the borax industry in California,
The first commercial production of
borax in the United States was in
184C, when twelve short tons were
mined in California. Borax production
in. the United States is credited by the
Government mainly to the colemanite
deposits in this State, although there
was some production, not very formid
able in amount, from the marsh de
posits of California, Nevada and Ore
gon.
California is seventh in the value of
products. Of the flfty-two different
classifications of minerals mined in the
United States in 1902 California Is cred
ited by the Government with twenty
six. Since that census, It may be re
marked, some discoveries have been
made in this State. The State Mineralo
gist of California, in fact, in his last
annual report claimed that more than
fifty different minerals are mined in
this State.
In connection with mines, quarries
and oil and gas wells the rank of the
States is set down as follows on the
basis of the complete returns of 1902:
Pennsylvania leads in the number of
wage earners employed and in the
value of products. Ohio is second in
value of products and third in number
of wage earners, Illinois is second in
wage earners and sixth in value of
products, Michigan is third in value of
products and fourth in number of wage
earners, West Virginia is fourth In
value of products and fifth in wage
earners.
RANKING TILE STATES.
The statistics and general statements
that are made relate to all mines and
quarries and petroleum and natural
gag wells that were in operation during
any portion of the calendar year ending
December 31, 1902. The inclusion of the
refined products for gold, silver and
other metals that are summarized in a
comprehensive tabulation brings up the
value of products for 1902 to $884,040,863.
an excess of $87,214,452 over the $796,826,
417 reported as the value of the direct
products of the mines, quarries antt pe
troleum and natural gas wells. The
returns for 1903 that have been given
out are necessarily incomplete, being
based somewhat on estimates. This for
the present makes the bulletin in hand
the latest handbook that will be avail
able to careful investigators.
That the State of California is cred
ited with heing the richest of any In
the sisterhood of States in the matter
of diversity of minerals will not be
overlooked by Investors in all parts of
the world, to whom the publication In
question will be a valuable and trust
worthy handbook of information.
The Department of Commerce and
Labor has caused the facts to be gath
ered from the mining census that was
conducted in connection with the
United States Geological Survey. The
census methods were modified to agree
with those of the geological ' survey.
The totals for the two offices agree.
Therefore the publication now submit
ted by the Department of Commerce
and Labor is reliable. This ia- an im
portant consideration, being a guaran
tee of the accuracy of the statements
made.
The State of . California, so reports
the Department of Commerce and La
bor in a bulletin just issued relating to
mines and quarries i of the United
States, although ranking seventh in the
value of products in 1903rheld the first
place in diversification of minerals.
This fact has been known to persons
familiar with the mines and minerals
of this State, but the official pronounce
ment of It by a branch of the Federal
Government h*as advantages that can
not be overlooked.

James Jackson (colored) will be sen- |
tenced to six months to-day by Judge i
Mown, who has discovered that he is !
an old offender in the larceny line.
Mr. Jackson was arrested one day |
last week for failing to return a bicycle :
which he had borrowed from a boy, j
and in court he repeatedly and solemn
ly declared that he had no recollection
of what he did with the vehicle. As he !
testified, his hat - in his hand, the j
Judge's eagle eye perceived a bit of j
paper stuck in and almost concealed by |
the sweat band. The headgear was I
snatched from Mr. Jackson's hand and j
the paper examined, and, sure enough, i
it turned out to be a pakn ticket show
ing* that Mr. Jackson had pledged one i
bicycle for the sum of $2 50. j
Then one of the bailiffs whispered
something to his Honor, who sharply
interrogated Mr. Jackson and quickly
ascertained that he was recently re
leased from prison after serving a six
months' term for stealing some Jewelry
from Mrs. Julia Taylor of 250 Minna
street and forgetting to remember what
he had done with the plunder until it
was found where he had concealed it
behind a gate post near the Taylor resi
dence.

So firmly wedded to the pistol-carry
ing habit is Charles Johnson that neith
er detention in prison nor judicial
warning can divorce him from it. He
was arrested several weeks ago for
brandishing his revolver in the face of
a Fifth street restaurateur with whom
he had a dispute over payment for a
meal, and when he promised to drop
the weapon into the deepest part of the
bay Judge Slogan gave him freedom
to do so. Instead of separating him
self from the pistol, however, he kept
it concealed on his person until Thurs
day evening, when he again displayed
it in a threatening manner in a saloon
at 839 Howard street. His case has gone
over until next Monday, by which time
the court will probably have devised
some other means of attempting' to
cure him of a dangerous mania.
The woman was arrested in the Em
porium by Special Officers Allan and
Tilton, who state that she had stolen
from that establishment four silver
spoons, three shirtwaists and three
sets of buttons, of the total value of
J7 30.
Ida Morton, a young married woman,
charged with shoplifting:, failed to ap
pear for trial before Judge Conlan

proaching maternity would make her

might result seriously. The case went
over till to-day for further inquiry.

in future."
The case was that of Ah Jim, who
stole a pair of pantaloons from the
clothing establishment of J. Rosenthal
on Dupont street and concealed the
plunder underneath his blouse, where
it was discovered by Patrolman Bert
Wren. Jini will be sentenced to-day
for petty larceny.

BERKELEY, June 17.â The reorgani
zation of the Berkeley Fire Depart
ment has begun, and the efforts of
Mayor Thomas Rlckard and Fire Chief
James Kenny, seconded by the Trus
tees, to give the town a better fire ser
vice are bearing fruit. Berkeley has
been practically without fire or police
protection for years, and the present
Board of Trustees, at the Initiative of
Rickard, has been attempting to reme
dy this delinquency. The old volunteer
department is being largely replaced
by paid firemen. In a few years more
the department will be entirely paid.
Several important changes are bslng
made in the department, to take effect
on or before July 1. Two old flre
houscs will be abandoned and four new
men added to the list of paid firemen
by that date. The money saved from
the abandonment of the houses is used
to pay the salaries of the firemen,
which now amount to $145 a month.
These men have only antiquated ap
paratus with which to work but hope
to be better equipped if the proposed
bond issue Is approved by the voters.
With the $145 a month expended on

salaries the city gets the services of
twenty-nine men, who receive $5 each.
The changing of these men from volun
teers to salaried flre-flghters has been
going on for two years and twenty
five of them have been carried on the
city pay-roll for a year. As fast as
the fire companies are disbanded cer
tain of the members are retained for

panies that remain intact, however,
there are still 150 volunteers who assist
at fires. The paid men are scattered

Honor ruled that the sidewalks of the
city are for the exclusive use of pe
destrians, that cyclicts are not pedes
trians and, therefore, the bicycle can
not be ridden on a sidewalk.
For that reason the case of William
Clarke, a wheelman, who failed to turn
out and dismount when meeting a pe
df.=trian on a sidewalk, was dismissed,
the decision being that any punish
ment administered under the ordinance
would be invalid.
The Judge used the following lan
guage regarding the question:
Any law that attempt* to KivÂ« a bfcyclttt
privileges to ride on a cMrwalk la Invalid.
The Council has no right to permit the
wheelman under any restriction* to use the
Â¦>!<!eÂ«-alk that under the municipal charter is
for thÂ« exclusive use of pedf-Mrlans. When a
City Council attempts to grant permission to
cyclUtK to rids on the sidewalk It goes ouUidÂ«s
of Its powers. I rid? a wheel myself, but I
keep to the street. The city must have a new
ordinance, or no more arrt-Ms of violators of
the bicycle law will b? of avail.

It will be remembered that In No
vember last a duel with swords, in
which the principals were MM.
Charles Ebelot and Henri Lautier,
ended in the death of the latter. 9 is
antagonist, an advocate from - Tou
louse, was the other day charged be
fore the Seine Assizes with "having- by
blows and wounds caused death unin
tentionally." Judging from the word
ing of the indictment, the law does
not take duelists seriously, or it would
not admit the supposition that they
do not enter, into the encounter with
any 'deadly intention. In this case
proof was forthcoming that the affair
had been carried out fairly, according
to the recognized rules .of. the code,
and the prisoner was acquitted. The
family of the deceased^took no part in
the criminal prosecution, .but obtained
in the civil action 1 fran: damages and

Very few people, says Railway Loco
motive and Engineering, would doubt
the electric telegraph being exclusively
a modern invention, yet experiments
were made centuries before the electric
telegraph came Into use, which indi
cated that a system of electric teleg
raphy could have been worked out had
the need of it existed.
In 1746 Le Monnier exhibited a series
of experiments in the Royal Gardens at
Paris showing how erectricity could be
transmitted through iron wires 95Q
fathoms in length. In 1753 Charles Mar
shall published a remarkable descrip
tion of the electric telegraph in the
Scots' Magazine under the title of "An
Expeditious Method of Conveying In
telligence." In 1846 George Lewis Le
sage, professor of mathematics at
Geneva, promulgated an invention of
an electric telegraph, which he eventu
ally completed and set to work In 1774.
This system was composed of twenty
four I metallic wires, insulated and in
closed in a non-conducting substance.
Each wire ended in a stock mounted
with a little ball of elder pith and sus
pended by a silk thread. When a cur
rent of electricity was sent through the
wire the eider ball at the opposite end
was repolled, the \ movement desig
nating a letter of the alphabet. By this
means word3 could be spelled out. It
was a crude method, but it was a com
plete electric telegraph system. The
reason why this and other inventions
of a. similar nature never came into
general use was that the need had not
arrived. â Express Gazette.

The copper, company seeks to ac
quire the chemical plant so .that . it
can use the output in connection with
its own plant at Keswick. By doing
this it will avoid bringing raw ma
terials jised for its purposes from tide
water to Keswick arid then returning
the finished product back to tide
water. A large amount of money will
be saved this way in freight charges.
If the deal goes through the plant at
Flemings Point will be enlarged and
employment given to several hundred
men. . It is rumored that the copper
company is also negotiating for a
chemical plant up the bay, near Mar
tinez, which will be consolidated with
the one here.

this matter for some time, but they

day at Los Alisos, Sunol, after a long
ilmess. Three years ago he wa3

BERKELEY, June 17. â The Berke

was a year old last night and the in
teresting event was marked by a birth
day celebration in the hall of Shat
tuck avenue. A banquet was served,
and, in spite of the fact that it was
all informal, turned out to be quite
successful. Assemblyman William H.
Waste was. the toastmaster. In his
opening remarks he 'si/oke of the pros
perous condition of the association,
which had struggled through its first
year without any great financial trials.
Responses to proposals were then
made by W. H.. Parkinson, secretary
of the.association; F. E. Sadler, Earl
H. Russell. Loring Barker, Louis Pape,
F. C. Ford, E. L. Davenport and the

Joseph's Well.
At Dothan. in Upper Palestine?. Is a
pool which has refreshed the traveler
for centuries. It is the well of Joseph.
Its environs form a dreary enough
prospect. Above It Is a low, Insignifi
cant hill upon whose summit cluster
a few miserable mud huts, and at the
base is the sordid anachronism of a
puffing steam mill, while away from
it stretches in all directions the faint
toned, almost hueless expanse of the
Syrian landscape, long reaches of
palest blue and gray and yellow, with
only an occasional blotch of brilliant
color in the foreground. Dreary and
waste and sad indeed is the scene to
the eyes of the flesh, but to the eyes
of the spirit that squat, bald hill be
comes a veritable Mount of Vislonsj â
visions a thousand times more real
and vivid than the spectacle of mud
huts and steam mill and rocky wastes.

in part:
It seems entirely fit and appropriate to me
that we should gather here to-day, the an
niversary of the battle of Bunker Hill, to
cr.nsecrate this burial plat of Lyon Pout
No. S. named after General Nathaniel Lyon.
who fell at the battle of Wilsons Creek, in
Mihgourl, during the early part of the Civil
War. Dust we are and to dust we must
return and the chief reason why we are met
here t'o-day is to turn back the pages of our
memory and meditate upen the ll\-es and
patriotism of the noble makers and defenders
of the nation, who are.no more on earth.
Bunker Hill and what transpired there had
bÂ«en a beacon Iirht of history. Even 1 nation
has bowed In homage and recognized thÂ»
valor there displayed by our forefathers.
When I visited the monument of Bunker Hill
as a boy I felt like Scripture tells us Moaes
felt when he approached the burning bush.
An unplaced voleÂ« teemed to whisper to me.
"Thou are treading on holy ground." The
herces of Bunker Hill helped to make the
republic, the veterans of the Civil War pre
served It and the younger heroes of the Span
ish-American war removed the yoke of op-
Uekslon from Cuba. These were grand and
glorious achievements arid all credit and rev
erence Is due tr. those who participated in
thtm. To-day as we consecrate this sacred
s|Â«t we have reason to -congratulate ourselves
on the condition of our country and to revere
the memory of those who bequeathed to us
such a splendid heritage, not forgetting the
father of our country. George .Washington,
and its Â«avlcr Abraham Lincoln. Let us be
guided by the patriotism which Inspired the
makers and defenders of this nation and our
future will be blessed.

The American bark Holliswood, which was

change received a tflogram from San Pulro
saying that the rchooner Transit from the
Columbia Itlver had been hailed by the Hollis
wood in latitude :;3 degrees .'{0 minutes north
and longitude 122 degrees :*> minutes wet<t.
That would mean that thÂ» bark was about KO
mllps soutbweyt of this j>ort. The Transit re
port* that the Molliswood was leaking badly
ani was short of provisions, which were fur
nlfliod her from the storf-s of the schooner.
The Holliswood is now 112 days from New
castle. Australia, bound for this port, and her
non-arrival yesterday caused her relnsuranct
ratÂ«-n to Jump from 15 to 20 per oent. The
revenue cutter Daniel Manning left port yes
terday to search for the missing bark and will
probably find her before morning. There vu
no change in the reinsurance rates for the

H. W. Reed, chief yeoman, who has been en

H. C. Fassett, who has spent fifteen years on
the Albatross in the service of the Fish Com
mission, or Bureau of Fisheries, as it Is now
called, was yesterday detached and ordered
to Loring, A'aska. to make a study of the
ralmon there. Faysett, during his long service
on the AlbatrOEs. has had the advantage of
co-operating In the most important scientific
researches in which the Fish Commission
steamer has participated, and he Is deemed
me of the most valuable men in the service.
He hae friends wherever the AlbatrOFs has
dropped anchor. To Fassett's skill as a writer
many of the who have cruised on
the Albatrom owe the conclf^nr^s of th^lr re

he has earned the promotion that has coroe to

The repairs will probably take not
more than a day and as soon as they
are completed the Lothian will resume
her voyage.
Captain and chief engineer were
! permitted to land to make arrange
i ments for the repairs, but the Lothian
i will be detained in quarantine during
', her stay in port. There are several
; cases of sickness on board.
The Lothian is bound from Hong
kong to Salina Cruz and has on board
768 Chinese passengers. When 2000
miles west of San Francisco a strain
pipe burst, doing considerable dam
age in the engine-room. As Salina
Cruz Is an open roadstead and lacks
facilities for making the repairs the
Lothian needs. Captain Williamson de
cided to run into San Francisco.
The China Commercial Company's
Steamship Lothian surprised the local
shipping world yesterday by putting in
au appearance at this port. It is some
time since San Francisco was aban
doned as a port of call for the ves
sels of this line and the Lothian's ar
rival caused much speculation until it
was learned that she was seeking re
pairs.
"The agreement," went on Mr.
Nash, "is for the benefit of the Job
bers In perishable products and not
for the good of the men who have
signed it. It 2s a measure of protec
tion to the Jobbers and not to us. It
prevents the retailer and restaurant
keeper from going on the wharf
to buy one sack of produce at a time.
It enables the jobbers to take produce
to their stores and sHl It to the retail
ers. The larger dealers do not ob
ject to retailing on the wharves, but
thry have placed these limits on the
minimum quantity to be sold entirely
to p'rotect the\jobbers."
Whrn Mr. Nash had concluded the
Commissioners went out with W. IL
Davis, the attorney of the board. This
frave the rival produce dealers a
chance to discuss ox>enly among them
selves the various statements that had
been made, especially those that had
been made by Nash. The smaller
dealers ridiculed the statement that
the combine was working in their In
terest- Remarks were made that
might have led' to uppercuts and
other varieties, of fisticuffs, but. noth
ing of the sort resulted.
The entire section of the wharves
where perishable products are sold
will be the scene ot animated discus
sion until next Monday forenoon at
least- Then the Harbor Commission
ers will decide whether the dealers
who have just been deprived of their
permits shall receive new ones to sell
en the wharves of the State.
Nash rose to accept this challenge.
Attorney Reinstein tried to dissuade
him from making any statement, Nash
having said that he would like to an
swer, but would not confine himself
to any categorical statement, affirm
atively or negatively. Despite Rein
ctein'B advice. Nash made his state
ment and incidentally Issued a "defi"
to the dealers who withdrew from the
Produce Dealers' Protective Associa
tion and who appeared as complain
nnts against I* Scatena & Co., Wolf
& Son and the American Produce
Company. "
"I challenge them," shouted Na^h.
pointing at the hostile camp of prod
uce men arrayed on the opposite side
of the Harbor Commissioners' board
room, "to say that they wish this
agreement of which Mr. Wise, their
attorney, complains to be changed."
There was response from the other
camp. Charlra J. Lercarl accepted
the challenge and said it was desired
that the agreement among the mem
bers of the combine should be discon
tinued.
TALKS ABOCT JOBBERS.
Incidentally, while making his ar
gument. Attorney Wise said that he
would challenge J. T. Xash to deny
that the intent of the agreement en
tered into after the Produce Dealers'
Protective Association dissolved was
that the members of the new com
bine -would not sell less than fifty
sacks of potatoes or twenty-five sacks
of onions to any member of the com
bine.
unexpected turn yesterday. Attorney
Wise had argued at great length that
the agreement among seventy or
more wholesale firms to sell no less
than fifty sacks of potatoes or twenty
five sacks of onions to any member of
the combine was in violation of the
Woodward law, which provides that
no discrimination shall be made as be
tween solvent purchasers. He con
tended that such an agreement
would effectually shut out of
business the dealers of email
mean 1 ?, who could not afford to buy
large quantities. Attorney Reinstein
replied that the agreement was all
right; that the provision to which Mr.
Wise/ especially oxcepted and which
provided that any quantities of onions
or potatoes less than those specified
in the agreement should bring a high
er price proportional to the smallness
of the lot, was just.
The proceedings took a somewhat
An important issue under the now
ramouj Woodward law to regulate th^
f;Â«1c of perishable products pn the
Site's property in this city was raised
before the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners yesterday. Whether new per
mits to sell on the wharves fhall be
granted to Wolf & Son, L. Scatena &
Co. and the American Produce Com
rany, who were deprived of permits
by the Commissioners last week, wan
p. Question then left unsettled. Ar
guments were heard from Attorneys
Otto Wise and J. B. Reinstein. After
Commissioners Mackensie and Kirk
r atrick had conferred Klrkpatrick
Pa id that R grave question had been
raised about an agreement on the part
of seventy or more of the wholesal
er of produce and the Commissioners
â¢Tinted time to consult with counsel.
A decision will be given next Monday
morning at 11 o'clock.
There were before the board npp.i
cntions from Ivanovich & Co., Mitch
ell & Goodall. Garcia & Maggini and
G Berti & Co. for permits to sell on
the wharves. These firms were de
prived of their permits by the Com
missioners some months ago. When
s permit Is taken away under the
Woodward law it is necessary only to
X^ay $50 for a new permit and to se
cure the favorable action of the Com
missioners. The firms of Ivancovkh
& Co.. Mitchell & Goodall. Garcia &
Mapfrini nnd G. Berti & Co. had neg
lected to deposit S50 with each of
their several applications. The sec
retary of the bonrd was instructed to
notify these firms that their petitions
would not be considered until the
money was deposited.
AX INEXPECTEI) TURN.
Had her enc'nes been stopped and due dili
gence been observed by the appellant. I believe
every Â«>ul on the South Portland could have
beÂ«n saved. He took to thÂ« first boat Instead
of remaining on the vessel and seeing that
every perron on board was in the boats, his
excuRe being that hÂ» had a superior knowledge
of the coast thereabout, and thereby could be
expected to land his boat safely. The fact is;
he thought he was at the time eighteen miles I
north of. the CapÂ« Blanco Reef.
Such conduct on his part on leaving the ves
sel at the time he did was, to nay the least,
extremely selfish, if not decidedly unseaman-
Uke. even though he had arranged with his
chief officer to take charge of and place in the
starboard boat those he left remaining on the
ship. The result shows how shocklnjly that
arrangement- was carried out. The sea was
comparatively smooth, and both of her boats
might have been safely lowered away with
passengers and crew In thÂ«m and got away
from the ship without accident under more
skillful seamanship.
I agree with thÂ» local board In Us findings,
but in consideration of the admission of some
of the testimony taken by the local board In Its
Investigation of the cause of the loss of the
steamer South Portland. I will mitigate the
penalty of the revocation of his license as
master, ocean, then having- three years ejght
months and sixteen days to run, to a suspen
sion of the same for two years from November
23, 1903.
Bermingham finds that Captain Me- j
Intyre. was negligent and unskill/ul, j
having changed the vessel's course
four or five times between the Colum- J
bia River bar and Cape Blanco reef,
where she fetruck about a mile and a
half from shore. She was then going
at full, speed in a dense fog without |
previously obtaining proper sound- j
Ings. Mclntyre at that time believed i
his vessel had struck on the reef off j
the Coquille River, about eighteen j
miles to the north of where she ac- i
tually struck. Captain Bermingham
says:
Justice Is tempered with mercy In
a decision handed down yesterday by
United States Supervising Inspector
Captain John Bermingham In the ap
peal of . Captain James B. Mclntyre,
formerly of the steamship South Port

â¢ An emissary of Japan, high in authority, has reached

thing in his power to win our friendship?
THE battles won by the' Japanese on the peninsula
above Port Arthur arc among the greatest actions
at arms that have gone. into history. 7 The latest,

King Victor Emmanuel's pet ambi
tion is to signalize his reign in the an
nals of Italy by converting Rome into
a seaport. The project of connecting
the EternaLClty with the sea by means
of a ship canal Is, of course, not a new
one; in fact, it has been mooted quite
a number of times. But now, thanks
to the energy and determination of
-the King, the scheme is about to be
put Into execution. The Tiber, which
should be the natural means of navi
gation between the metropolis and the
sea, is, unfortunately, useless for the
purpose, as the shifting sands at its
mouth, its winding course and its ever
changing shoals and pools not merely
render it unavailable for any sea-going
craft, but are likewise 'of a nature to
preclude any attempt to render it navi
gable by means of dredging for ships:
of large tonnage. â¢ The canal, however,
could easily be constructed and offers
no engineering difficulties. The total
cost has been estimated at $11,000,000.
the idea being to make it wide and
deep enough to enable two vessels of
big tonnage to pass each ether, and
the time required for the construction
would be between four and five years.
The distance from Rome to the sea is
considerably under fifty miles and the
canal would have the, effect of draln

Against the Kaiser's rebellious fub
jects â the Hereros. These warlike
native?. 50.000 strong, have provided
ihe Kaiser's crack army with the
toughest military nut it hss been
Â¦exiled upon to crack since the war
svith France, and after Fix months of
blundering by leaders of the lower
rank the Emperor decided to send an
officer from the general staff to the
scene of action. General von Trotha,
who enjoys a fine reputation as an or
ganizer and tactician, is taking with
him reinforcements of 1500 men and
horses, and he will assume the active
I'ommind of the colonial army later
in June.
The new commander in chief is 56
years old. From 1894 to 1897 he com
manded the Kaiser's colonial forces in
East Africa, and in 1900 he accom
panied Count von Walderpee to China
Â»ith the rank of major general.
â¢ Problems that will tax General von
Trotha'n abilities to the fullest await
him in West Africa. The Hereros
have proved a crafty and stubborn
foe. In the serious engagements that
have so far taken place they have suc

Signally. Their resistance has, indeed,
become so stanch that the Germans
have practically declared a truce
pending the arrival of reinforcements
from home: Armed with the Mauser
rifles and ammunition' supplied them
by German settlers in ' peaceful days,
the Hereroe have shown that they are
strategists as well. On two occasions
they have decisively outwitted their
crack antagonists, killing and wound
ing more than 100 officers and men.
There Is considerable my*tery about
the result of one ftghtyfind the where
abouts of a machine gun. with which
the natives are believed to have got
away. The Herero*, like the Boers,
are all mounted, understand the art
of lighting behind cover and se>m to
have mapped ont a comprehensive
guerrilla campaign. The Germans,
fresh from the fortresses and drilling
grounds of the Fatherland, find them
selves confronted with the necessity
of opposing tactics about which they
know practically nothing. The Hereros
occupy a country admirably fitted for
a tedious defensive campaign. The re
gion is mountainous and heavily tim
bered ami well fitted for harassing the
operations of an organized enemy.
The difficulties confronting Germany
in its Southwest African colony have

Many of the railroads in the South
are prone to giving passes indiscrim
inately, so that on come of the smaller
roads about all the prominent people
who live along the line are carried
! free. Storekeepers, sawmill proprietors,
politiciansâ in fact almost everybody
who can afford to pay his fare goes
scot free, while the negroes and poor
country folk pay the large fares ex
actedâthe larger, of course, for the
ronds* loss on the deadheads. One
Georgia railroad, however, according
to the Boston Transcript, has set its
face against the evil, and has resorted
to Scripture to make plain Its position.
It has posted in the two or three pas
senger cars that comprise its equip
ment the following notice:

Biblical Warning.
The ornithologists of the Department
of Agriculture have been making an
investigation of the economic va'ue of
the Bob White, or meadow lark, as we
call him in California, as a result of
which it Is now announced that that
bird is "probably the most useful
abundant species on the farms."
Field observations, experiments and
examinations show that the Bob White
consumes large quantities of weed
seeds and destroys many of the worst
insect oests with which farmers con
tend, and yet it does not injure grain,
fruit or any other crop.
It is calculated that from September
1 to April 30," ' annually, in Virginia
alone, the total consumption or weed
seed *y Bob Whites amounts to 373
tons. Some of the pests which it ha
bitually destroys, the report says, are
the Mexican cotton. boll weevil, which
damages the cotton crop upward of
$15,000,000, a year; the" potato beetle,
which cuts off $10,000,000 from the value
of the potato crop; the cotton worms,
which have been known to cause $30,
000,000 loss in a year; the cinch bug
and the Rocky Mountain locust,
scourges which leave desolation in
their path and have caused loss to the
extent of $100,000,000 in some years.
The report urges measures to secure
the preservation of the Bob Whites in
this country. '

He will have in mind the matter of parks and park
ways, of architecture, of the most effective methods to
supply vantage points from which to see wonderful
vistas of -ba3 r , ocean and mountains, and of the. adorn

existing. From his labors much in the way of good
suggestion is expected.
From the pinnacles of the highest hills in the city,
the Twin Peaks; from the rocky headlands that rise
on opposing ?ides of the Golden Gate and front the
width of the blue Pacific, on the tops of scores of ele
vated localities, there is so much to be seen and to be
admired that the oldest citizen who is endowed with
artistic perception and sense 'of the picturesque never
tires of looking. With a system of improvements that
is commensurate with the opportunities afforded the
scenic advantages will be greatly enhanced.
Los Angeles has paid a great deal of attention to
the creation of a park system and has thereby provided
for its enjoyment some of the show places. of the United
States. Sacramento is now incubating schemes for the
bcautification of the area that has been known for many
years as the China Slough. Improvement clubs in all
parts of this State are engaged in making the best of
their surroundings, employing their best judgment to
produce good effects.
Development of natural beauties has been longer de
layed in the larger cities north of California, on the
Pacific Coast. Now, however, stimulated in some de
gree by the coming Lewis and Clark Exposition, Port
land, Oregon, is entertaining large ideas lor its' own
Â¦improvement. A report has been obtained from John
C. Olmstcd of Boston, who laid out the Lewis and
Clark exposition grounds, outlining a system of park
ways, boulevards and parks for the city.
A large forest reservation west of the Willamette
River with a f picturesque parkway running along the
river bank, extending to another large forest rcscrva
. tion on the hills northwest of the Mountain View Park
addition and connecting City Park and Maclay Park;
a river bluff parkway cast of the river and connected by
a bridge with a parkway west of the river at Fulton;
another river bluff parkway east of the river to a bluff
park, west of Columbia University; a great meadow
reservation among the Columbia sloughs; a park on
Mount Tabor to preserve hill scenery cast of the river;
a boulevard^ to Mount Tabor Park; parks on Ross
Island and Swan Island â these are among the largest
features of the scheme as reported.
There is no doubt that Portland will be benefited if
it enter upon large and properly conceived improve
ment on. the plans outlined in the foregoing. The Pa
cific Coast is properly the scenic region of the United
States and its attractive places are numerous. Common
advantage will be derived from having all the principal
places on the routes of travel 'on this coast made as
pleasing as possible'. They will form" a chain to draw
spectators from the remotest parts of the civilized coun
tries of the earth.
THE minds of the people of the Pacific Coast have
Â¦ ever been awake to the advantages that inhere
in developing the picturesque surroundings with
which they are endowed by nature. In this city, after
some years of discussion' of a preliminary sort, an asso
ciation has . been formed having for its purpose the
improvement and adornment' of San Francisco. A
landscape artist of acknowledged reputation and of wide
experience has been engaged to provide a plan suffi
ciently comprehensive to serve for the future and a
report will be submitted by him for consideration within
a year.
\ BEAUTIFYING . COAST CITIES.
The Board of Health, after a "deal of agitation, inves
tigation and discussion, has legislated pure milk for San
Francisco. It will be interesting to watch now what
relation these new laws will bear to a practical reforma
tion of conditions which have become a serious menace
to the health of the city. A little more watchfulness by
officials, and a little less la'w from municipal bureaus
might work wo'nders.

"little war" has already cost the Kaiser
over *3,000,C00 and has wiped out the re

the military problem, the financial loss
and the economic waste involved in
the war, the rebellion has stirred up a
nasty departmental squabble in Berlin,
with the Foreign Office, the Colonial
Office and the War Department fight
ing each other and indulging in all
kinds of Intrigues.
Meanwhile General von Trotha must
have been a good deal embarrassed by
the attentions that were' lavished upon
him prior to his departure. Since the
news of his appointment was made
public he hap been feted throughout
the country. Banquets have been given
in his honor, and speeches made glori

After the fact it i^ easy to see how more effective
means might have been taken to save life after the
fire started. It was in the bow of the boat. The offi
cers ran her to beach, bow on. This made a draft that
sent the blaze quickly her whole ; length, cutting off
all chance of escape from death by fire except death by
water. . When beached she was still ., in water at such
depth and so far from shore that beaching her did no
good. The stream there is' always full of craft of all
kinds. It would seem that v if the officers had backed
her, blowing signals of distress, the fire would not have
been forced astern, and backing in midstream other
boats could have approached and taken off many of
the passengers who perished by running her ahead.
But f there is little time for thinking in ten minutes
in such a panic and such peril, v and the officers did the
best that occurred to them. The lesson should be
heeded wherever boats are liable to be crowded, and
people who use them, a<? well as the officers who com
mand them, and all public authority that may be in
voked, should concert measures that will secure the
maximum of safety.
Within the brief space of ten minutes between 700
and 1000 perished in East . River, at the beginning of
what was intended to be a day of pleasure. In ali of
its aspects the calamity is sad and awful and appeals
to human sympathy far and near, as shown by the con
dolence ofjnunicipal officers in this country and Europe,
and the official sympathy expressed by the President
of France and other rulers, through President Roose
velt. *"-
Probably not one in all the hundreds that swarmed
on the Slocum thought of danger, or planned how to
meet it if it came. Least of all dangers is it probable
that any thought of fire. New York and all the-Atlantic
Coast cities and the towns on the Great Lakes have this
boat excursion habit. There is a charm in being on the
water that lures thousands to enjoy it, and so there are
in tall such cities regular summer excursion boats that
rarely leave the dock with less than the limit of passen
gers allowed bjy law, and this limit is often exceeded
with impunity. These are usually wooden boats, and
even if the hull is metal the upper works are of wood
and very inflammable, because of the use of paint and
varnish.
Official regulations are made ; to secure safety, but
these seem insufficient. The profits of the owners of
the boats depend upon accommodating all that can
crowd aboard, at a cheap rate, and there is such a
universal lack of caution and care for consequences
among excursionists that every boat is a floating possi
bility of disaster. No one can control nor hold in dis
cipline such a crowd as went to its death on the Slocum.
Any slight thing that would cause a panic would be
sure to bring injury and death to many under such con
ditions.
For a brief time excursion going folks who seek
escape from the blistering heat of waterside cities in
the East will remember this awful scene and avoid
crowded boats. But the memory of it will soon pass
away and other boats will be as crowded and with risk
as great. It ought to be easy, in the case of v such
organizations as the Sunday school that was on the
Slocum, to regulate the number going on. board so as
not to crowd the boat and to divide the children into
commands, each instructed to obey a captain. By select
ing cool-headed persons for command, who know all
about getting at life preservers, rafts and boats, the
fatalities might be minimized, even in the face of such
sudden and unexpected peril as struck the ill-fated
pleasure boat and turned her into a floating and fiery
charnel house. It may be well to invoke some form ,of
public authority charged with the enforcement of all
possible precautions. When Sunday schools and other
organizations with a definite number charter a boat,
such public authority would take charge and all the
passengers could be instructed to obey its commands.
The whole subject will no doubt be fully discussed,
and as in the case of precautions in theaters some
measures will issue from it that will enhance the safety
of such crowds on such craft.
THE Chicago theater fire was the cause oMmme
diate official attention to fireproofing of theaters
and places of public assemblage, and to the con
dition of exits therefrom.' The hundreds who died in
that catastrophe were not sacrificed altogether in. vain;
Small as may be the consolation to the thousands who
mourn them, their fate saved thousands of others "by
the stern regulations which it caused to be made all
over the world, whereby a similar horror is made less
possible. j
The opening of ;the heated term and of the con
current excursion seasqn in New York is the occasion
of the greatest disaster on the .water that has ever oc
curred in this country. The children of a largeparish. on
a Sunday school outing, crowding a regular '"'excursion
"boat, have been cruelly sacrificed to a false feeling of
confidence in the safety of the boat. No doubt her hull
and machinery were in order and the official inspectors
had done their duty. But no matter how fit she was
for the waters on which she sailed there is never safety
on such .a boat, crowded to her limit with women and
children, whose only thought is the pleasures of the
DISASTERS ON THE WATER.
It seems no longer safe for Russia to depend upon
her supposed superiority in numbers and equipment.
Japan has a military force of one million men. Russia
claims ten millions. But she is far from her base, while
Japan is in ready contact with hers. The Japanese have
won the respect of the whole military world, and the
non-military as well. Japan has generals who are as
keen experts in the art ; of war as Alexander, Caesar,
Marlborough and Napotebn in their day, and as skill
ful as Grant and Von Moltke. Then they have observed
strictly all the conventions of warfare, according to the
most modern ideas. They have been gallant to prisoners
of war, have given every care to the wounded enemy
and have buried their dead foemen with all the honors
of war. The Western nations can well afford to fellow
ship these island warriors and patriots. They are no
discredit to the civilized family of the world in which
they have incorporated themselves in the short space
of a half century.

Considering the favorable official and
private crop reports, wheat has ruled
remarkably firm, the high price having
a natural effect on foreign demand. In
fact it was reported that exporters
were selling wheat at Duluth.
Stocks will be low when the new crop
is harvested and domestic consumption
has absorbed offerings despite compar
ative quiet of late at Northwestern
mills. Wheat exports from all ports of
the United States, flour included,
amounted to 1.371.304 bushels, compared
with 2.S09.002 bushels a year ago.
Liabilities of commercial failures
thus far reported for June aggregated
$4,151,108, of which $1,SM,7C2 were in
manufacturing, $1, 879,394 in trading and
J416.S52 In other commercial lines.
Failures this week number 257 in the
United States, against 213 last year,
and 16 in Canada, compared with 24 a
year ago.
Industry suffers from an epidemic of
ultra conservatism emanating appar
ently from the theory that a season of
expression must come every ten years,
while the coincidence of a Presidential
election furnishes another precedent.
As a result, stocks of merchandise have
been reduced, railway traffic is less
ened, preparations for future business
are curtailed and less money is dis
tributed in the form of wages, while
those having capital to invest confine
their attention to the highest classes
of bonds or hold back for still lower se
curities prices. All these factors have
combined to produce a reaction entirefy
out of proportion to the natural read
justment that was really started by
abnormally high prices of raw mate
rials and other excessive costs of pro
duction, resulting in accumulation of
goods that could not be sold at a prof
it. Retrenchment has made consider
able progress, wage earners as a rule
recognizing the importance of accept
ing reductions in pay. The lake strike
has been adjusted, leaving little friction
between employer and employe.
As the season advances the crop out
look improves and there is no funda
mental weakness in the nation's com
mercial or financial position. Evi

numerous, however, railway earnings

loss of 7.1 per cent, as compared with

LOS GATOS, June 17. â The one hun
dred and twenty-ninth anniversary of
the battle of Bunker Hill was fittingly
commemorated at Los Gatos to-day
by the Bunker Hill Association and
other. patriotic societies of San Fran
cisco, acting in conjunction with the
local Grand Army post and Board of
Trade. ' Â¦
The San Francisco contingent ar
rived by a broadgauge train at 11
o'clock and were met at the depot by
the Grand Army* post and a delega
tion of citizens and escorted to Bunker
Hill Park, where the literary pro
gramme was held.
-The Tenth Infantry band, which ac
companied the excursionists, opened
the exercises with a patriotic overture.
After a prayer by Rev. Ernest Bradley
of St. Stephen's Church, the president
of the day, Colonel A- D. Cutler, pres
ident of the Sons of the American Rev
olution, made a few opening remarks
and introduced Alfred Wllkie, who
sang the "Sword of Bunker Hill."
Edward H. Hart delivered a stirring
oration on patriotism, in which he con
trasted the Eastern States, with their
historic landmarks, with the newer
civilization of our own State, and
closed with a glowing tribute to the
patriotism of California.
The Oakland Masonic Quartet, con
sisting: of Messrs. D. M. Lawrence, H.
W. Patrick, Alfred Wllkie and Wllhelm
Nielsen, sang "My Own United States."
An original poem entitled "A Flag of
Truce" was recited by Professor E.
Knowlton, followed by a soprano solo,
"The Star-spangled Banner." by Mrs.
Greenleaf Kruger. The Masonic Quar
tet rendered "The Shot Heard Round
the World." The audience was request
ed to rise and sing "America," and
was dismissed with a benediction pro
nounced by the chaplain of the day.
In the afternoon music for dancing
was furnished by the band, and races
and athletic games were held.
This year's celebration was the big
gest that has been held in Los Gatoa
by the Bunker Hill Association, it be
ing estimated that, including those
from the surrounding country, there
were from 7000 to '8000 people In town.
Almost every business house was dec

charge arranged a tasteful display on
Main street and at" the picnic grounds.
The park where the picnic was held
is known as Bunker Hill Park, Jt hav

tables and benches and a large dancing
platform, making an ideal spot for a
celebration of this kind.

Crop advices to Bradstreet's tell of
improvements. This is most notice
able in winter wheat, harvesting of
which has become general in the
Southwest and in California. Spring
wheat 'is *also making progress along
satisfactory lines. An average crop of
wheat ha* been raised in Texas, but
the yield in California will be below
the average owing to damage by dry
winds. The stand of corn is good, but
the weather Is too cool for the best
growth. The California grape and
raisin crop will be very large and
southern peaches promise a heavy
yield.
The leading industries generally dis
play quietness, iron and steel are dull
ard production is being curtailed but
price weakness is less manifest. The
lumber trade is'rather irregular, being
very much depressed on the Pacific
Coast, fairly active In the Northwest,
but rather dull in the East. Low prices
for yellow pine are inducing a change
In demand to those sorts from white
pine.
NEW YORK, June 17.â Bradstreefa
Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Favorable features this week are the
further improvement shown In leading
crops and the ending of the tie-up on
the great lakes. Wheat, cats and cot
ton have improved, but corn is still
backward owing to the cool weather.
General trade and industry have re
mained quiet and may be said to have
"marked time." The mrtable underly
ing feature of the entire situation is
the feeling that with an average yield
of wheat and large crops of the other
cereals and of cotton now in prospect
a good fail and winter business is to
be looked for. Pending further progress
in this direction the tendency is to
await events. Prices of leading pro
ducts have felt the Influence of crop
news. Wheat, oats and cotton declined,
while corn had remained steady on re
ports of backward conditions and
small supplies offering. Railway earn
ings reflect current quietness in busi
ness and the decreases of 3-5 per cent
of gross in May and of 6 per cent In
April net. indicated last week, are con
firmed by fuller details. Transporta
tion business generally is better than
in 1902. Bank clearings, more imme
diate reflection of current business,
show an enlargement over last week,
but the grand totals still show reces
sions from a year ago. The cross cur
rent of ebb and flow, noted at dif
ferent cities, however, may possibly be
significant of a change in the tide. Col
lections still reflect the influence of a
backward spring In retail trade and
are complained of as slow at a num
ber of centers. Money continues easy
and the stock market activity is large
ly professional.

OFFICERS IX PURSUIT.
Onr~e admission was gained, the hold
ups directed their attention to the
Btrong box. Fi\e sticks of dynamite
veie placed on top of the safe and ig
rited. The charge was insutticlent, and
another and larger cap was used. The
second charge exploded with terrific
force, bloxvin? out the side of the car
and throwing the safe a distance of
forty feet. .After rifling the safe of
its contents the robbers commanded
the train crew to remain quiet and no
harm would be done them. Whilt*
jrivln? this command one of tho
robbers accidentally struck the en
gineer with his revolver, and in apolo

a railroad man.

A whining religion wins none, -n
avowedly racing machines, built solely
for speed. The Challenger, designed
by B. B. Crowninshield of Boston, who
designed the ninety-foot Independence
for T. H. Lawson, is a fin-keel boat 42
feet 6 inches over all, 26 feet on the
â¢water line, with a beam of 10 feet 4
inches amidships. The hull draws 2
feet 6 Inches and the fin brings, the
draft up to C\' s feet. She has a short
bowsprit of 3 feet 7 inches and carries
about 1000 square feet of canvas. She
was built by John Twigg & Sons and
won the cup by defeating the sloop
Harpoon, sailed by F. R. Cook.
The Corinthian, designed by W. S.
Burgess of Boston, is 56 feet over all,
24 feet on the water line and has 14 feet
6 inches beam. She has a draft of
only 2 feet 7 inches and a centerboard
with a drop of jibout 8 feet. The steal
body was constructed in the East and
the wooden skin covering it was built
by F. Stone & Co. F. Stone will sail
her, the crew being made up of J. C.
P>rickcll, X. McLean. J. Short, F. E.
Fchober and Douglas Erskine.
W. G. Morrow, owner of the Chal-
Icnper, will sail her and has the advan
tage of great familiarity with his boat.
Jt is thought the Challenger will do
lÂ»est in a hard blow, but that the Cor
inthian may elip along faster in light
airs. The race will be unusually In
teresting, as being the first that has
occurred between two regular racing
machines In this bay.

The Tigers are more than holding
their own, and Mike Fisher is to be
congratulated In keeping his band to
gether, as he has succeeded In doing.
It looked all along as though the Tigers
were playing above their ability and
that they could not maintain such a
fast clip, but this theory has been dis
pelled since they got going and met and
beat the best of them, and decisively at
that. . .
Los Angeles seems to have developed
a faculty for hitting the ball as soon
as it arrived on northern soil. This
was the weak spot in the southern
team while it was playing here and
on the home grounds. The Angels have
really outslugged the mighty sluggers,
the Siwashes, on their own battle
ground, and If they can keep this up
there will be doings.
The Oakland team has not been play
ing its game for the last couple of
weeks. The players have not hit the
ball as hard as they are capable of do
ing, and their work on the bases has
been exceedingly slow at times. The
team has also developed the bad trait
of taking an aerial voyage In one.in
ning and remaining in the lofty height?
just long enough to allow the opposing
team to make enough runs to win the
game.
race for the coast baseball pennant. It
is one leader to-day and another to
morrow. If anything, the struggle for
supremacy has waxed more keen in the
last few days, and it seems another
fortnight will be required to tell which
team can rightly call the first place its
own.

ing is improving steadily.
W. W. Richards writes from Big
Meadows that the water is still a trifle
high, but it is going down at the rate
of three inches per day. The fishing
is crood and is improving.
H. A. Greene of Monterey reports
that 2000 pounds of salmon were
taken in three days by professional
boatmen. The fish averaged about
eleven pounds. There are plenty of
sardines and anchovies in the bay.

that in spite of the loss of Kortlang,

The Pacific batsmen made no stand
at all against the San Francisco Coun

matches which have recently been
played in the class singles tournaments
it was decided to re-classify the play
ers. The standing as arranged fol
lows:
First class â W. C. Allen. N. Ambrose, George
L. Baker, A. H. Hrabant, C J. Dunlap. C
K. Foley, Carl Gardner, Clarence J. Griffin,

Of these Herbert Long and Clarence
Griffin are perhaps the besL They
are both young players who are im
proving rapidly and who have given
a good account of themselves in past
tournaments.
Percy Murdock and Will Allen will
probably be the strongest players en
tered in the tournament and in either
one of them Champion Grant Smith
would find a formidable opponent.
George Baker has not made up his
mind whether he will play or" not. If
he decides to take part he will be a
dangerous competitor.
William B. Collier Jr. .finds he will
not be able to spare the time to take
part.
Among the other players who will
compete are: George Janes, Herbert
Long, Melville Long, Clarence Griffin.
N." Ambrose, S. C. Gayness, Sidney

RAIN STOPS SPIRITED GAME.
TACOMA; June 17. â Jupiter Plu
vius butted in and stopped the game
after the visitors had their inning in
the sixth. Although short, the game
was full of excitement and Umpire
O'Connell handed out fines of $5 to
Hilderbrand and Knell, besides chas
ir.g them off the lot. The trouble
tame in the fifth, after Doyle hit to
left field. He stretched it to a double,
but probably would have been out had
Reitz touched him. The decision was
close and the San Francisco men made
a bis fuss-
Before the row ended O'Connell
held the watch on the visitors and dis
ciplined them. Thomas was effective
and pulled himself out of a tight hole
in the fourth after Waldron doubled
and Irwin singled. The visitors' tally
came on Miller's single and Egan's
error. Irwin's error and Casey's sin
gle scored Egran in the second and
Eheehan's double and Egan's single
brought the former home with the
winning tally. Score:

ANGELS WIN IN A CANTER.
SEATTLE, Wash.. June 17.â Seattle
went down to defeat this afternoon in
a windstorm, a cjoud of dust and a
rainstorm. The weather seemed to
be to the liking of Los Angeles.
The- men from the south simply ran
away from the Siwashes. giving them
a little consolation toward the end of
the came.
Big Warren Hall had everything in
the line of good pitching, and as long
as there was a ghest of a chance for
Seattle to get into the running he kept
Going. .
After a while he took things easier,
the ball became wet and Seattle man
aged to cnop out a few hits. Six out of
Heattle's eleven hits did not count for
cnythlnjr. On the other hand only
three of those gathered by the cham
pions were wasted.
Williams put the ball over the plate
us biff as a balloon, and every man on
the Los Angeles team, excepting Flood
tnd Hall, made from one to three hlta.

PORTLAND. June 17. â Buchanan,
brought up by Pete Lohraan to pitch
ball for the team from Oakland, gave
a wonderful performance this after
noon on the Twenty-fourth street
grounds. Others may have played in
the game, but nobody had eyes for
anything but the work of the big man
in the short sleeved uniform of the

Huchanan used the black art on them;

CHICAGO, June 17.â The American
Derby will be run at Washington Park
to-morrow. For the first time in the
history of the race a dÂ«termined at
tempt will be made, it is said, to pro
hibit betting. Mayor Harrison issued
an order to the police several days ago
that no betting is to be permitted at
Washington Park this vear, and to
morrow 300 policemen will be at the
track, it is planned, to see the order is
enforced. Officers of the track have
promised to enforce the law, and indi
cations to-night are the Derby will be
decided without the excitement of open
betting. Out of 119 horses originally
named sixteen are carded to start. In
point of number this falls three short of
the field last year. What the race lacks
in number this year it more than makes
up in class. Experts figure six as on
more even terms than in any previous
race. These are English Lad, Moharib,
Highball. Fort Hunter, Rapid Water
and Bill Curtis.
The big powwow will be held at Har
bin Springs to-day when James W.
Coffroth, representing the Yosemlte
Club, and Harry Pollock. Jack Mun
roe's representative, will meet the
mighty Jeffries. Dr. Devening will be
an Important figure at the conference.
Apparently all parties at Interest are
anxious to have the fight take place on
the 30th inst.. if it is possible for Jef
fries to appear In the ring. The cham
pion will suffer somewhat in prestige
If it is found necessary to declare the
fight off. The club will lose the large
amount It has expended for advertis
ing. Munroe will come out of it best
of all. He will lose the amount of his
training expenses, but the advertising
he has received has made him a much
sought after attraction and he will
soon be reimbursed, for. the time he has
spent on this coast.
There was but little improvement
yesterday In Jeffries' condition. Dr.
Devening changed the treatment, ap
plying Iodine and glycerine to the in
jured knee. This was done twice dur
ing the day. A boil developed yester
day on the leg above the knee and was
taken as a good sign by the "first aid
to the injured" brigade headed by the
chief nurse Kid Eagan.
Jeffries has been eating sparingly
since he has been confined to bis bed
and has taken on but little flesh. Kid
Fagan expressed the opinion yester
day that a few days' exercise would
fit Jeffries for the ring if his knee
would permit him to move around.
There is a feeling about Jack Mun
roe's training quarters that the fight
will not take place. Every one about
the establishment. Including the miner
himself, seems to be of the same opin
ion. Instead of going through his usual
stunts yesterday Jack loafed all day
and did not do a stroke of work, al
though there was a big crowd on hand
to see him perform.
"While no one in the camp has any
authority to speak on the subject still
each and every one of the miner's re
tainers feels confident the battle of the
year will not take place. Tim Me-
Grath has about given up hope and
Andy Gallagher says there is no chance
and that the big fellow knows It as
well as does any one else.
Manager Harry Pollock has not ex
pressed himself as to the probability of
the fight's coming off. No one knows
whether he and Munroe have had a
talk about the matter, but it Is likely
they have postponed such a discussion
until Pollock's return from the camp
of the champion. Munroe's trainers
announce that the miner will resume
work to-day and keep on till It Is of
ficially settled whether or not the mill
Is to be held.

HAMBURG, June 17.â M. Thery in a
RIchard-Brasier won the James Gor
don Bennett international automobile
cup in a magnificent race. In doing so
he has gained a double victory, for he
demonstrated both his qualities as
driver and the perfection to which the
automobile industry has been brought
fn France.
Rarely has so much tense suspense
been crowded into ten hours. At the
end of the first round M. Thery was
thirty-one seconds behind M. Jenatzy,
the "Re dDevil." as Hamburg has
learned to call the winner of last year's
race for the cup.
At the second passage of the two re
doubtable antagonists before the grand
stand M. Thery was one minute and
forty seconds ahead, tearing along the
closely guarded road at a speed that
thrashed the spectators Into excitement.
The champion of France and the
champion of Germany contested every
kilometer with bitter determination and
reckless audacity. As they swept past
the third time M. Thery was leading by
nine minutes and thirty-five seconds.
The people did not know the exact'fig
ure. All they realized was that M.
Thery was widening the gap separating
him from his relentless pursuer, and
that was enough to bring forth deafen
ing cheers, that drowned even the
thunder of the passing machines.
"Bravo, Thery." . "Vive la France,"
and a wild tumult of delight, confidence
and pride showed there was enough of
a mighty-lunged French contingent
present, or that the spectators were
mainly Francophile.
Never did a couple of hours seem so
long. Partisans of both men strolled
restlessly about, looked at their watches
every minute, tried to chat and showed
by their indifference to what was said
that their thoughts were riveted upon
some other subject. They were think
ing of one or other of the two men
flying around the racecourse, the win
ning of which meant peril to life and
limb. - V>V
At last the trumpet call announced
the racers were coming. The suspense
at this moment was maddening. M.
Jenatzy was about due. "Was it M.
Jenatzy whose approach was signaled
or had some mishap delayed him?
The warning trumpet call was for
M. Jenatzy. His arrival was gre'eted
with cheers, in which, however, some
anxiety was discerned. M. Thery had
started twenty-eight minutes after M.
Jenatzy and at the end of the last
circuit but one he was leading by more
.than nine minutes. If he passed the
line inside of nineteen minutes he had
won the cup. If he passed twenty
minutes later than his competitor. M.
Jenatzy retained the coveted trophy.
Then began the real period of anx
iety for M. Thery's well wishers. The
Emperor had returned at about half
past four to witness' the finish, but
even interest in his movements failed
io make the time pass quickly. Ten
minutes, eleven, were ticked off. Have
they been delayed by any cause? Sud
denly the trumpets blare forth. There
is a quiver of excitement that swells
into a shout and develops into a crash-
Ing roar of triumph. M. Thery had
won the cup.
As he flew across the finishing line,
like a bomb skimming the earth, the
grandstands on both sides of the road
were a mass of waving handkerchiefs.
The Emperor took off his cap and
waved it in the air. As for the French
visitors, their enthusiasm was deliri
ous. If M. Thery had won back
Alsace and Lorraine he could not have
received a more tempestuous ovation.
No accident of consequence was re
ported throughout the race.

In the first round the advantage was
on the side of Forbes. In the second
round Nell landed some heavy blows
on Forbes' stomach, and Forbes put In
a number of left Jabs and right upper
cuts on the champion's face. The blows,
however, had little effect on Neil, who
rushed constantly throughout the
round.
At the opening of the third round it
seemed Forbes was about to gain the
upper hand. He sent a straight left to
Neil's face, Btraightenlng him up, and
then crossed with the right to the Jaw.
He repeated this twice more without a
return. As they backed away from a
clinch Neil let go a vicious left swing,
which caught Forbes fairly on the chin,'
and he went to the floor. He was up
at the count of nine, but was weak.
Neil sent another left to the Jaw and

finished as named.
The winner proved to be Lady Uncas,
at 40 to 1. She was well handled
by King and lasted long enough to
be awarded the decision In as close a
finish as the Judges have had to. de
cide this year. In another stride
Broomstick would have won.
The race was run on the main track.
Reliable had been assigned 138 pounds,
but aNpenalty of five pounds for win
ning after the weights were announced
brought his impost up to 143 pounds,
and his owner wisely, scratched him.
This left Hurst Park the top weight
of those down to start, but wise heads
did not think any too well of his
chances when they recalled the fact
that at Morris Park he was slow to
begin. He ran well enough, however,
to prove he will do to back in a smaller
field. <
SHEEPSHEAD BAY, June 17.â Close

On account of the depressed condi
tion of the salmon market, many can
neries in Alaska will not be operated
this year. Other packing companies
will go farther north, where they will
catch, less pink and get more red sal
mon. Reds are now selling at $1 25 on
the coast, while pinks are very low,
the minimum quotations being 50 cents.
This is below the cost of production and
there is no profit for those compa'nies
the bulk of whose packs are pinks.
The cause of the unfavorable condition
of the market is overproduction pri
marily.. An effort Â¦ has â¢ been made to
maintain prices, but without avail. â

BIGGS, June 17.â Mrs. Augusta
Humble, a pioneer woman of Biggs,
native of Germany, committed suicide
this morning at 7 o'clock by taking
strychnine. Her husband said that
during the past two years he has three
times prevented her from* killing her
self. She quarreled with him on ac
count of things she wished for the
house. He told her he was unable to
provide the money, upon which Bhe
again threatened suicide. She fol
lowed him about the. premises, per
sisting In her demand for money, and
finally went to the house. Her daugh
ter and son shortly afterward called
in the doctors, who discovered that
she had taken strychnine. Mrs. Hum
ble refused medical aid until too late
to prevent death.

"WASHINGTON. June 17.â ThÂ© Navy
Department to-day made public the
conclusions of the liquid fuel board of
the navy, consisting of Commander
John Edward, Lieutenant Commander
F. H. Parks and Lieutenant B. H. Han
ley, formed as the results of tests cov
ering a period of twenty-eight months
with coal and oil, respectively, as a
navy fuel. In the opinion of the board
an Intelligent flreroom force should find
no trouble In burning oil In a uniform
manner, and for general purposes on
ehore high pressure steam was found
to be a better spraying medium than
air.
Regarding the question of burners
the board says "that as the warship is
designed to be operated at short no
tice, under the severest forced draught
conditions, the question will have to
be considered whether It Is not more
advisable to fit air burners that would
be found most efficient for the day of
battle rather than In an Installation
of steam burners that are most desir
able for general cruising."
The board declares that" no fuel oil
Installation should be permitted for
marine purposes which would not per
mit a return to coal within twenty
four hours in case of the failure of tha
oil supply.
Naval Experts Believe That
Oil Can Be Successfully
Burned on Fighting Ships

There was no Orange auction, as there was
not enough fresh â¢ stock available. In the
open market Oranges and other Citrus fruits
cut but little figure, as the cool, cloudy
weather restricted trarte and dealers were busy
with deciduous fruits.
The fruit market had an easy tone, as local
trading was quiet, as usual on Friday, and
the call for shipping was limited to small
purchases of well-colored lots of early de
ciduous fruits, supplies of which were more
than sufficient fcr the demand. Cherries and
Gooseberries were firm at Improved values, as
stocks of both are steadily decreasing, but all
other descriptions were easy, with prices tend
ing downward. ThÂ« canners were offering
54c p*r pound for Royal Anne Cherries, but
were unable to procure them, as the distillers
were paying 6c for surplus iots. Currants met
with a sluggish demand and were weaktr, as
receipts were liberal and the carrv-over from
the preceding day was large. All kinds of
berries were In good supply and prices were
lower all arcund. as a large portion of the
receipts, particularly of Strawberries, were of
poor quality and i the demand *vas nothing
extra.

I The selling of Southern Pacific was large. In

I The buying was believed to be In the nature
; of supi'ortlr.g orders, but it served to relieve
. thÂ» anxiety lect new financial plans should
break the Southern Pacific and thus hurt the
market. Sharp decline; in the Metropolitan
group of street railway stock* were a depress
ing Influence. News of crop conditions was
very favorable, but was disregarded. So were
the report* of heavy sales of copper, both for
domestic and expert. The money market was
Â¦ called weak, seven months' loans being made

I million dollars. Southern Pacific was forced
down 1H late in the day, but vigorous sup

CHICAGO. June 17.â Prospects of a free
movement from the farms in the near future
had much to do with producing a weak un
dertone in wheat to-day. At the close July
wheat was down HÂ©VÂ»c. Corn is off %@iÂ£c.
Oats shtw a loss of %@'%c and provisions a
shade to "He. â¢ '.-â¢
Steady cables and a big decrease In Argentine
shipments caused a fair degree of firmness
in wheat at the start. Opening quotations tor
July were unchanged to He higber at MVitf
S4*ic. The: market .soon lost Its initial
strength, however, on selling by pit trailers
ani commission houtes. The greater part of
thf trading was In the Septtmber delivery.
Offerings were much in excess of the demand
and as a result prices started downward. The'
cliler cause of the early selling was excellent
weather conditions throughout the greater part
of the country. There were also numerous
bearish crop reports. Canadian dinpatches as
serted that crops had made fine progress dur
ing the past week and that the acreage w.ll
be 9\4 per cent more than for 1003.- Equally
bearish news regarding spring wheat In Min
nesota and the Dakotas was ' received from
Minneapolis, reports from a thousand inquiries
sent out from that city showing a somewhat
larger acreage than last year. In connection
with harvecting operation* in the Southwest
a St. Louis trade paper claimed that Indica
tions point to a satisfactory yield with quality
generally good. Talk about new 'wheat com
ing on the market was played to advantage
a* a bear card. The weakness of the Sep
tember and December options at Mlnnsapolls
also had a depressing influence on the market
hen* late In the day. *A fair recovery . was
made In July during the last half hour on
covering' by shorts. . After selling down to
S-'%Â©KJ?*c that delivery closed at S4&S41&C.
September ranged between 70^e79V4c and
?'J~,*c, closing at 7SH4t?79ttc.- *
Sentiment in the corn market early In the
day was somewhat unsettled, but as the ces
rlon advanced the tone became quite ; weak
as a result of heavy selling of July by a prom
inent commission houte. July opened a shade
to JSc lower at 4S^,Â©4$\c. sold between 4Sc
and 49<! and closed at 48-Hc. . â¢ â¢â¢Â¦
Oatg w*re affected by the weakness of corn
and by an official . report- showing increased
acreage in Canada. - After opening ?ie lower
at 30 Vc July sold between 3>%c and 3VHC,
closing at 36*4??3S%c. .
In provisions there was enough realizing by
lecal longs to cause a reaction and a change
frum- strength to comparative weakness. Small
receipts of liogs and firm prices at the yards
were early bull far-tors. The market closed
near the bottom, with September pork down
5<g7Hc at $12 &0612 82%; lard was off 2^c

Mississippi Tomatoes are about cleaned up
and stocks of Mexican are steadily decreasing,
but the market is still overloaded with Los
Angeles stock, which is weak, and large lines
have to be carried over from day to day.
Asparagus is a little firmer, with the ctnncn
paying 5c per pcund for No. 2 and 5Hc for
No. 1. Offerings of String Beans consisted
chiefly of dried and tough stock, which
dragged, but fancy lots were firm at the top
rate and occasional sales of fine stock from
Haywards were reported at a slight advance.
Cucumbers continued to weaken under in
creasing receipts, but the other vegetables
shewed little change.
Receipts of new Potatoes were heavier than
usual, and although trade continued active
the market had an easier tone and prices
r&nged lower. The top quotation, for white
was extreme and obtained only for a few lota

peted for by rival jobbers. $1 75 being the
top for the general market. Garnet Chiles

women, who had arrived as stow

the Canadian authorities at Montreal
and the. attempt to bring the women
Into the United States through British
Columbia was for a time frustrated.
But the men then took the women to
New Westminster, B. C, and brought
them over to the American side at 2
o'clock one morning in a fishing boat.
From, that point they came to this city
by â¢ rail. Inspector . Geffeney, who is
also an interpreter of Japaneese, came
to this city with .warrants last Tues
day.
Sugiyama was convicted of a similar
offense several years ago in the United

A tin box in the possession of Alan
A. McAlpin when he died at, Jiminez,
Mexico, was the object of a fultless
journey in quest of a supposed for
tune. The facts are set forth in the
report of John W. McAlpin, accom
panying, his final account as adminis
trator of Alan A. McAlpin's estate,
filed yesterday in the' Superior Court
The administrator states that he
had reason to believe that Alan A. Mc-
Alpin had* possessed considerable
property, and the tin box which Alan
had at the time of his death was sup
posed to contain valuable papers and
a will. The State of Chihuahua de
clined to surrender the box or to fur
nish any information regarding its
contents, so the administrator sent H.
L. Paddock, an attorney, to Mexico to
investigate. Padodck had a personal
acquaintance with Ygnaclo Sepulveda,
legal adviser of President Porfirio
Diaz, and Sepulveda is said to have
deplored the bad state of affairs re
garding the custody of the tin box
and assured Paddock that he would
have no more^trojible in getting it.
Being thus assured Paddock ap
pointed a citizen of Mexico, W. H.
Searles, to look after the case, but
when Searles forwarded the contents
of the tin box it was found that there
was no will nor any evidences of a
fortune. So, according to the admin
istrator's report, the estate of McAl
pin consists only of. $783 64 cash and
160 acres of land in San Luis Obispo
County, valaed at S1000.
Administrator of McAlpin Estate
Tells of Fruitless Trip ofÂ«At
" torncy to Mexico.'
At this point another tilt occurred
between opposing counsel. The court
admonished the attorneys that Bide re
marks would no longer be tolerated.
After a futile effort on the part of the
defense to force the witness to admit
he was under pay of the Police Depart
ment, the case was continued until
Monday morning.
The witness said he was familiar
with' the warehouse and the piles of
wheat and was positive that the grain
on which Jacob Eppinger borrowed
money in April of 1903 was shipped to
a foreign port In December of 1902. The
witness had not counted the sacks in
the piles and had not weighed the
grain, but got his information by look-
Ing over the shoulder .of the weigher
while he was making entrles t In his
book.
Williams' testimony regarding the
manner of doing business in the ware
house was corroborative of others, who
swore that affairs were conducted in
a loose manner. The numbers on re
ceipts were frequently disregarded and
orders and reports were taken by tele
phone. He recalled the time when pile
709 had been shipped instead of 710 and
said that Chief Inspector Bunker had
been telephoned to regarding the sub
stitution and was satisfied, as the
quantity and quality of grain In the
piles were identical. Concerning the
lots of wheat on which the money was
borrowed and on which the indictment
is based the witness gave detailed tes
timony.
"At any time between December 5
and April 25 were there any piles
marked 706, 707 and 708?" was asked.
"Yes," was, the reply.
"Did not each option pile have Its
own lot number?"
Robert Williams, a deputy grain in
spector for the Merchants* Exchange,
occupied the stand yesterday in the
case against Jacob Eppinger, charged
with obtaining money under false pre
tenses. On the direct examination his
testimony was damaging to the de
fense. On cross-examination by Henry
Ach an effort was made to show bias
on the part of the witness and in thia
he succeeded to some extent when
Williams admitted that his expenses
had been paid by Detective Gibson
while they were searching for James
Deming, superintendent of the ware
house at Crockett. He stated positive
ly, however, that aside from this he
had never received a cent from the
Police Department nor/ had he been
promised any money. /
The same fiddle that squeaked on the
Fidehills.of Tuolumne County in "the
days of old, the days of gold, the days
of '<9," feebly echoed memories of the
past at Golden Gate Park yesterday.
Circled about the gray-haired fiddler,
Jim Fuller, were men and women who
had heard the strains of the battered
instrument when it inspired boisterous,
healthy amusement in the golden days.
It brought back to them the gulches
and the little cabins of the mining
camps. While their children and their
grandchildren chattered merrily about
them they were silent, looking through
dim eyes back over the waste of yes
terday to the time when every one in
Tuolumne owned a million â in the
ground.
The old violin squeaked tales that
outdid anything in fiction. It told of
the big-armed miners, the true-hearted,
courageous i>ioneer women, of the all
absorbing quest of gold, of loves and
fighting. Even the chattering of those
who did not know grew subdued as the
venerable fiddler bowed over his instru
ment in the "Days of Old."
Then gray-haired miners rose and,
leaning on their canes, spoke words
that even Bret Harte could not chron
icle. " 'Twas out of Chinese Camp.
Pete Smith, he was my pardner. Every
one here knows Pete. He's dead now â
Vent up in a blast. Well, me and Pete
lived off the burro for a week. Then
we boiled the hoofs. Just when we was
trying to chew the bones we struck it.
The dust lasted three weeks in Frisco â
we had to throw some in the bay to get
rid of it. But we dumped it all. We
knew there was lots more in Tuol
umne." ; -)',
So ran the tales.
Reminiscences that thrilled and
brought tears to the eyes were told of
the old mining camps â Sonora, Jim
town, Shaws Flat, ScrapervIIle, Pine
Log. Chinese Camp and Poverty Flat.
Each had its tale; all were worth hear
ing. The "Old Friends of Tuolumne"
ivtll meet again next year.

Closely Questions Witness in
Eppinger Case Regarding
Connection With Police
At the meeting of the Fire Commis
sioners yesterday a communication
was received from Colonel A. "^An
drews of the Diamond Palace asking
permission to present a gold watch to
the valiant fireman. President New
hall of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children tendered a
bronze medal to the hero. A check
for $25 from the California Fruit
Canning Company, where Mrs. Massa
was employee!, was sent to the Fire
Commission to be presented to En
gelke.
The Fire Commissioners recom
mended that Mayor Schmitz send En
gelke to the St. Louis World's Fair as
an exemplar of the kind of men who
compose the' San Francisco Fire De
partment. In addition the commis
sion granted him two months' leave of
absence with full pay.
Dynamite will soon be among the
fire-fighting weapons of the San Fran
cisco Fire Department. The Fire Com
missioners made application yesterday
to the military, authorities for permis
sion to store quantities of the explo
sive. In event of a great conflagration
it Is indispensable that the department
should have it on. hand. The value of
dynamite in blocking fires has already
been proved in the East.
Honors came fast yesterday to Aug
ust Engelke, the heroic fireman who
rescued, at the imminent risk- of his
own lifei the three-year-old boy, Lau
rie Massa, from a burning flat at 41
Vandewater street recently. Engelke
swung himself from the window of
arr~adjoining room.^took the baby in
his arms and descended on a ladder
raised by his comrades. . Â¦ Â¦

ACH ATTEMPTS
TO SHOW BIAS
AN OLD FIDDLE
RECALLS PAST
ENGELKE OVERWHELMED
WITH HIS MANY HONORS
I call the board's attention also to the fact
that there is no limitation, restriction or no
tification to the Auditor concerning civil ser
vice eligible list.* as applied to this commit
tee's expenditures.
I wish bere to emphasize the fact that
where civil service provisions apply the offi
cial in whose department the employes are to
be employed .will be presumed to : follow the
law and where such provisions do not apply
he cannot be compelled by a declaration of the
budget to make them comply. Â¦.. ;Â¦-.
- \\ hile the Twin Peaks auxiliary water sup
ply- system for Increased fire protection, for
which $150,000 is appropriated, is a desirable
and perhaps, under present conditions, a
necessary expenditure. I wish to call the at
tention of the Board of Supervisors to th* fact
that the Spring- Valley Waier Works Is col
lecting from the city ,_every year, a large
amount of money for such fire protection, and
that In nxing its rates hereafter. If this
auxiliary system shall be Installed, there
should be deducted from the amount now al
lowed Â¦ that company for, such' fire .protection
the cost of operatinr the- auxiliary system to
gether with Interest and. Â¦ proportion of costs of
construction thereof. ' "
.The company clearly Is not entitled to col
lect rates on the ordinance of 1902-1903. and
as it has itself caused to be suspended by la-
I hereby disapprove and veto the following
words In the Item relating to sanitary measures
in the dUtrict known as Chinatown, to wit:
"A special committee of the Board of Super
visors with, the advice of." leaving the ex
penditure of the appropriation of $10,000 to the
State and City Boards of Health and the United
States Marine Hospital Servlc* at this
pott, on the ground that I such expenditure
should for beÂ«t results properly tÂ» made by
the various health authorities.
In this connection also, I wish to call the
attention of the board to the fact that no
civil service restrictions were attempted to be
placed on the employment of the men who
were to receive the moneys to be expended by
the special committee of the Board of Super
visors for such work, although for similar
work by other departments civil service noti
fications, limitations and restrictions were
liberally applied. â¢ -V- Â¦â¢â¢Â¦
I am also informed that the chairman of
the Public Utilities Committee has employed
clerical help without application to, or rec
ommendation by. the Mayor or without the
affirmative vote of fourteen members of the
Board of Supervisors, as required by the char
ter, and that he has failed to select the same
from "any civil service lists, although In. open
board a very fervent advocate of the applica
tion of civil service provisions to other munic
ipal departments, and I am further Informed
that one of his appointees is not a resident of
the city and county of San Francisco. By
what right or authority the chairman of thia
committee has created and appointed to public
positions these employes I do not know.
NO LIMITATIONS NOTED.
CLEANING OF CHINATOWN.
The members who are responsible - for the
drafting of this budget have zealously labored
to fasten upon every department Involving re
sponsibility to the Mayor of the city the bur
den of doing work with employes not of their
own selection, taken arbitrarily from lists of
men, many of whom are absolutely unfit prop
erly to do the work expected of them, while
In the departments friendly with and of the
same political party as the members referred
to. and Indeed, hi the matters under their
own Immediate control, they have been very
careful not to provide these restrictions.
I have no fault to find with the principles
of civil service reform. If the practice ac
corded with the theory a beautiful govern
mental fa brio could be created; but when men
taken from the civil service lists rejoice In
their disloyalty to the administration of which
they are a part when they write letters to
public officials recommending applicants for
employment upon the sole ground that they are
political enemies of the Mayor of the city,
I think it high time to express a disapproval
of conditions which would In no private bus
iness enterprise be tolerated even for a mo
ment and which do not make for the best In
terests of the city..
EMPLOYES ARE UNFIT.
I wish to call the attention of the members
of the board and also of the people of San
Francisco to the manifest petty political re
taliations and unconcealed hypocrisy which
are apparent In the construction and presenta
tion of this budget. In every department of
the city administration which is directed by
officials who owe their appointment to the
Mayor of San Francisco the figures of the ap
propriation have been calculated with such
subtlety and with such restriction, as seri
ously to impair their efficient operation and
almost to cripple their admfnlstratlon. while in
departments controlled by the political col
leagues of the gentlemen who drafted the
budget liberality and indeed extravagance are
easily to be found. â .
The following items were reduced by
the amount set opposite to them in the
vetoes of the Mayor: â¢
Public convenience station. Fifth street,
$7500; electric elevator. City Hall. Â»760O: new
stenographer. Board of Supervisors, *1200;
Finance Committee, expert services, $8000; ad
vertislns, $1000; law books for public offices.
$1000; expenses in acquiring public utilities,
$3000; maintenance of minors in non-secta
rian institutions, $5000; premiums on official
bonds, $1475; expenses of eult of Spring \a.
ley Water Company. $15,000; driving tenders
and dolphins at Third-street bridge, $3000.
Total reduction, $53,675.
The Mayor's veto ran in part as fol
lows:
Under the rules the veto message will
be officially printed once and will then
be referred to the Finance Committee
for a report. When the message comes
before the board it will require fifteen
Supervisors to override the specific
vetoes. Booth and Payot are away,
and it is likelv that the vetoes will be
sustained by the votes of Finn, Rea,
Lunstedt and Boxton.
MESSAGE TO 'BE PRINTED.
- In reducing the appropriation of $25,
000 to $10,000 for defending the Spring
Valley Water Company's suit against
the city the Mayor says he will with
draw his veto If the money Is used to
bring an action to settle the water rate
controversy.
right to dictate In the premises, as the
law must be obeyed without any out
side interference.
Junction tho rates for 1903-1901 there are. In
my opinion, do rates which It can enforce or
collect, and I believo that during the past
year thÂ» Spring Valley Water Works has beÂ«n
collecting Its -water bills illegally from thÂ«
rate payers and water consumers of San Fran
cisco and any one of them, in my opinion, has
thÂ» right to refuse payment of any rates base!
on the ordinance of 1902-1903. When the Su
pervisors this year passed an ordinance, tlx
lag water rates for 1904-19C5 the Spring Val
ley Water Works began another action similar
in kind to the action of the former year and
will nndoubtedly proceed to collect Its water
bills as during the past year upon the basis
of the rates of two years ago.
The Mayor vetoed all the clauses Jn
the budget directing that money ap
propriated for salaries shall be used
only for civil service employes. He
contends that the Supervisors have no
Mayor Schmitz yesterday transmitted
to the Board of Supervisors his veto
message on the municipal budget for
the next fiscal year. The appropria
tions vetoed or reduced by the Mayor
aggregate^ the small sum of $53,675,
which is much less than was expected.
The Mayor explains that there are a
number of Items he deems unjust which
he would have vetoed, but it would
be futile, as the appropriations so elim
inated could not be used for other pur
poses.
The appropriation of $628,336 for in

turbed. The Mayor contented himself
with scoring: the Board of Supervisors
for what he considers petty tactics in
crippling departments over which his
appointees have supervision, and claim
ing that offices friendly to the Demo
cratic majority of the Board of Super
visors were treated in a liberal man
ner.

assigned to speakers as follows:
On one of his periodical visits to -the
racing tracks of the Pacific Coast he
met Miss Hopkins, and love ensued.
They were married and an ideal life of
married happiness, according to their
friends, has been the result.
What steps, are to be taken to vindi
cate Mrs. Quinn's good name and dis
pel all the rumors connecting her with
a low intrigue remains to be deter
mined. The reports connecting her
with the attempted suicide in St.
Louis are strongly resented by her rel
atives in this city.
Relatives and friends of Mrs. Charles
Quinn in this city are indignant at the
stories printed in a local morning paper
of accounts of her attempted suicide
in St. Louis. As a matter of- fact Mrs.
Quinn has never been in St. Louis and
is now with her husband in Chicago,
living in a handsomely furnished flat
at 5731 Madison avenue, one of the
swellest residence districts of the mid-
Eastern metropolis.
Whoever the unfortunate woman was
in St. Louis, who shot herself for love
of a bartender, it was not the wife of
Charles Quinn. - On May 1 Quinn and
his wife left San Francisco for an
Eastern trip and went first to, the Au
ditorium Hotel Annex in Chicago. Two
weeks later they removed to a flat on
Madison avenue. - Never at any time
were they in St. Louis.
Mrs. Quinn was formerly Miss Belle
Hopkins, niece of E. W. Hopkins of
this city and heiress to $1,000,000 under
the will of Mark Hopkins, one of the
"big four" who constructed the Central
Pacific line. She is said to be in the
receipt of $1000 a month as an income
from her property. Two years ago she
met and married Charles Quinn, who
was "bred in old Kentucky" and car
ried in his strain the love of pretty
women and fast horses that comes
from birth and breeding in the blue
Grass meadows.
