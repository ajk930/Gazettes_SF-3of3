SALT LAKE. Utah, Feb. 3.â Oscar
Beebe, a cattle rancher of Emery Coun
ty, in this State, is the discoverer of
an immense body of radium bearing
ore. The rock is located on the Beebe
ranch, forty-five miles north of Emery.
There is raid to be a ridge of this
ore 2000 feet Jong; by 50 yards wide.
ThÂ»^ pitchblende ore is very dark, in
crusted With* a greenish yellow sub-
KtjLBce, which contains the radium and
uranium in high percentage. The car*
rotite is a canary yellow rock and
quite pretty. Professor Hilderbrand's
analysis shows that this contains 52
per eer.t of the uranium and 18 per cent
of vanadium.

6x>ecial Dirpatch to The Call
NEW YORK, Feb. 3.â Archbishop
Farley has been offered tho red hat
of a Cardinal and his visit to Rome is
for the purpose of discussing the mat
ter with the Pope.
This report, whlch.has been confined
strictly tn religious circles, leaked out
to-day and accvunts for the unusual
interest taken by the Catholic clergy
In Archbishop Farley's trip to Rome.
The Archbishop carries a letter from
the American Archbishops to the heads
of the church in Rome-. One small
part of this, it was hinted to-day, is a
mild protest from the American Cath
oliCB against the recent tdict pf the
Vatican against the presence of female
voices ljj church choirs. It is gener
ally felt that a strict enforcement of
the edict would c*-ork a great hardship
here.
The Archbishop carries with him to
Rom* a larger offering of Peters pence,
it is said, than any the Vatican has
previously had from this archdiocese.

CONDITION
OF HANNA
PRECARIOUS
Senator Has Setback
but Family Still
Is Hopeful.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 3.â Senator M.
A. Hanna had a setback late this aft
ernoon, which for a time considerably
alarmed his family, who had been en
couraged to hope he was getting to be
hfmself again, but the congestive at
tack which they feared was averted to
some extent by prompt action, and to
night the Senator, while not sa well as
early in the day, showed excellent ral
lying power and improvement over his
condition at sundown.
The setback came in the form of an
attack that resembled sick spells that
have seized the Senator on two or three
occasions in the past few years. . He
was .taken about 5:30 this afternoon
with a congestive chill, which has been
marked heretofore by a rush of blood
to the head and coldness of the i ex
tremities. Members of the family were
on hand at its first outbreak, and by
the prompt application of mustard
plasters and hot water the attack was
prevented from becoming so serious as
it was feared it might become, and later
in the evening it was stated that the
Senator's condition was again almost
at his normal staje of the past 'few
weeks.
Dr. Rixey, the attending physician,
called in Dr. Magruder, and when they
left Mr. Hanna's home at 9 o'clock the
Senator was sleeping soundly and the
physicians said they did not expect
to return again until 8 o'clock to-mor
row morning. When th'ey left the Sen
ator's pulse was 86, his normal pulse
being 72 and the temperature 100, or
1-10 above the normal. The doctors
said th<^ thought his temperature
would l>*JnDrmal again in the morning.
A thorough examination was made of
Mr. Hanna's heart, lungs and kidneys,
and they were found to be all right.
Dr. Rixey to-night said:
"Senator Hanna's condition is not"
alarming and I hope he will be out in
a week or ten days. His illness is due
to physical and nervous exhaustion,
caused by attacks of grip and over
work." o
At the request of Mrs. Hanna, Dr.
Brewer, the New' York physician who
has attended the Senator and members
of his family at intermittent periods
for the past twenty-five years, has been
asked to come to Washington for con
sultation with the other physicians. He
is expected to arrive here early to
morrow morning.
Elmer S. Glover, the Senator's pri
vate secretary, postponed his trip to
Chicago, which he intended to make to
night, to attend the meeting of the
sub-committee of the National Com
mittee, to make arrangements for the
National Convention. Mr. Glover hopes
to start to-morrow with Senator Scott

WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â Mail advices
from authentic sources which reached
several persons in '..Washington to-day
indicate that a terrifying state of af
fairs has existed recently in Haytl. One
letter from Port au Prince gives the fol
lowing account of happenings at that
place:
"Affairs here are in a state of wild
and dreadful disorder. While the Presi
dent, General Nord, was in Gonaives.-a
city In the northern part of the repub
lic, a conspiracy was discovered to in
augurate a revolution, not so' much
against General Nord himself as for the
purpose of getting control of this city
and forcing the President to agree to
certain measures respecting the libera
tion and pardoning of a number of
Haytiens implicated In the bank scan
dal. When the time arrived to carry
the plot into execution many withdrew
therefrom. One of the number, General
Maximo Nomplaizer, was, however, de-'
termined to carry it through.
"Learning of the conspiracy, the mili
tary governor of the city, with a num
ber of soldiers, broke into the house
where Nomplaizer and a few pf his
friends were gathered. Orders were
given to shoot all those within on the
spot. Those who were killed were Nom
plaizer, his son, one or two other per
sons and a servant. The. owner of the
house escaped by jumping. from a sec
ond story window, and in so : ' doing
broke his leg, but managed to crawl to
the house of a German, who gave: him
shelter. - The military authorities ar
rested arid Imprisoned his wife...
"Hearing this the man informed the
authorities that if they would release
his wife he would "return to his house.
He kept his word, returning to the
house, where the authorities found him
in bed after a physician' had set his leg.
Without any, ceremony they killed him
as he lay there by firing thirteen bullets
Into his.hody.
"The foreign residents then became
alarmed, and the German admiral In
formed iihR. authorities if their action
did not . cease he ' would t land marines
and take posession of â . the , city. . This
stopped ; further - proceedings.'
SAN FRANCISCO; THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4; 1904.
SUSPENSION of the well-known firm of Bolton, De Huyter fr Co., gen*
** eral commission brokers, was practically announced yesterday after*
noon when notice was sent out for a meeting of the creditors at 49O Cat'
ifornia street to*day. The firm was about emerging from the stress of
losses incident to the failure of Sharp & Bryan of New-York, when it
was discovered that one of the clerks had, without the knowledge or con*
sent of Bolton, T>e Tiuyter Sp Co., extended unusual credits to local cus*

conjecture as to the amount in
volved in the failure, but there is
an impression that the sum will
approximate $250,000. The losses
will fall" chiefly on local custom
ers^ It was surmised last evening
that some of the banks would be
heavy losers, but inquiry elicits
the statement that no bank is
concerned ; to . any considerable
extent. Some- years ago the
Crocker - Woolworth National
Bank was very close to the house"
of Bolton, De Ruyter & Co., but
the connection during Â» r,ecent
months has not been close
enough to create comment. ;
Last eveningjohn E. de Ruy
ter courteously; declined ; to speak
of the; firm's embarrassment or to
foreshadow, /announcements.; He
referred The Call toV.Thjpimas CC.

Van Ness was seen , at -his resi
dence and asked ? if * the;, report f of
the firm's suspension was found
ed on a fact, and. he replied that
a meeting of creditors had been
called.
BEGINNING OF TROUBLE.
"The embarrassment of Bol
ton, De Ruyter & Co. began,"
said Mrs' Van, Ness, "when the
failure of Sharp & Bryan of New
York occurred. That failure hap
pened last- September and bore
heavily on Bolton, De Ruyter &
Co., .who were: correspondents in
California. That was the begin
ning of the trouble in San Fran
cisco, yet it was not the immedi
ate cause of the decision to call. a
meeting of creditors. The stress
caused by the New York disas
ter was really overcome-by the
San Francisco correspondents,
but the members of the local firm
exhausted their resources hv or
der t< meet unexpected losses
and protect their creditors. Let
me explain that causes, other
than the failure of Sharp & Bryan
contributed to the embarrass
ment of Bolton, De Ruyter , & Co.
TJay. before yesterday the knowl
edge I suddenly came to the firm
that a clerk or a subordinate con
nected with the firm had, with
out; the ; consent or authority of
the house, extended large credits
to^ local; customers,; and it was
disclosed by- investigation that se
rious losses would* surely â  be i the
result of this unauthorized ; ac-.
commodation."

amount involved in . the' failure
would .reach $200,000 or $300,

"All the transactions will *be

I cannot say how many creditors
there are, but the number. is quite
large. The losses will fall chiefly
on individuals residing in the
city. In truth, the firm could harve
gone ahead with the brokerage
business, as there is no shrinkage
in the value of securities, but
when I saw the real condition of
affairs and. estimated the looses
arising from the acts of a subur
dinate I advised a suspension of
proceedings until the creditors
could. .be consulted." <'\^
"You ' ask the' question," re
marked Mr. Van Ness, "if any" of
the local banks will be subjected
to heavy loss., In my "judgment
the suspension of Bolton, De
Ruyter & Co. will not entail
serious loss to any bank in San
Francisco. There is no reason
why any other firm should fail.
True, a feeling of distrust or lack
of confidence may develop inhe
rent weakness in other firms.
Robert C. Bolton, the senior
member of the firm, very. nearly
exhausted his resources in meet
ing the losses . incident to the
New York failure. It should be

ment of the house is not due to

Special Dispatch toThe CilL
GUATMAS, Mexico. Feb. 3. â Pas
sengers arriving this morning from
Ortiz, on the Sonora Railroad, brought
the first news of a terrible crime com
mitted by Yaqui Indians. The stage
which runs between Ortiz and Las
Cruces was held up by the savages
and all on board, numbering six per
sona, were killed, among them Salva
dor Flores and his nephew, Francisco
Flores.
The Flores belong to families prom
inent ip Sonora. They were en route
to the Guadaloupe mine near Las Cru
ces, as were also three Mexican min
ers traveling on the same stage. As
the coach was rolling over a moun
tainous section o^f the ,road. the Yaqui
rebels appeared *f rota <2zLin<l a. anvall
butte. There were fifteen in the par
ty, according to the recollection of
Francisco Flores, who did not expire
until after he was picked up by a
party of vaqueros, who were traveling
in the opposite direction. The In
dians opened fire on the driver with
out even calling on him to throw up
his hands, and he was dead on his
box before he could reach for his gun.
All three miners were armed and re
turned the flrt, which only incited the
Yaquis to further murder. The elder
Flores begged the miners not to re
turn the fire, believing the^ Taquis
might spare them if they did not re
sist. They realized that resistance
was useless, as t*e Indians far out
numbered them. ' The Indians soon
mowed down their victims and all but
the younger Flores were instantly
killed. He wjis left for dead, but Sur
vived long enough after being found
to tell the story of the terrible affair.
The Indians carried off the express
which was on the stage and exchansj*?d
their worn out horses for those draw
ing the stage. When the crime was
discovered the officers in charge of
the garrison at Ortiz v/ere notified and
a detachment of mounted troop3
started in pursuit of the Indians. The
attack has occasioned great alarm
among the mining camps in the vicin
ity of Las Cruces and travelers are not
venturing on the roads without escort3
unless several are traveling together
and all are well armed.
KAISER'S VOICE
IN PHONOGRAPH
Record to Be Kept at Harvard
University, National Museum
and Congressional Library
BERLIN, Feb. 3.â A phonographic
record of Emperor "William's voice on
metal matrices will be the first de
posits made In the phonetic archives
that are to be kept at Harvard Uni
versity and in the Congressional Li
brary and the" National Museum at
Washington. The Emperor, upon the
application of EÂ»r. Edward W. Scrip
ture, the psychologist of Yale Univer
sity, through the United States Em
bassador here, has given two examples
of his voice for â permanent preserva
tion. Dr. Scripture, describing the
meaning of his request, said:
"The phonetic archives are -to Include
records from such persons as will pre
sumably have permanent historical in
terest for America. The Importance of
the undertaking can be estimated by
considering what would have been the
present value of voice records of De
mosthenes, Shakespeare or Emperor
William the Great. An advisory com
mittee of eminent Americans has pre
pared a list of ten living Americans of
the first historical Interest, whose
voices will be preserved. I wish to
record his Majesty's voice as the first
European record deposited in the ar
chives."
The Emperor received Dr. Scripture
after the morning church service on
Sunday. During the making "of the
record the Emperor was alone with the
phonograph. He spoke twice 'into the
apparatus. The first cylinder, made
especially for the Harvard University,
contained observations on Frederick
the Great. The other was a short dis
quisition on "Fortitude in Pain." The
Emperor's manner was kind . and he
showed interest In the matter. * These
archives of voices are said to be the
first instituted for historical purposes.2

At the top of the blackboard
are suggestively arranged two
heads, one bear, one bull â and
one full-grown eagle â but no
lamb. Under these, showing the
scope of the transactions, are
headings for the New York stock

San Francisco grain market,
other grain markets, and room
for quotations of wheat, corn,
oats, pork, lard, ribs, etc. The
field of deals covers about every
large corporation that has shares
in the market.
All last night the windows of
the offices of Bolton, De Ruyter
& Co. blazed. Within the offices
a force of clerks toiled under the
electric lights. Bookkeepers were
busily 0 engaged in getting ac
counts posted and laying the
basis for a financial statement of
the firm to be exhibited at the
first meeting of creditors. Re
porters who secured admittance
were told by the manager of the
concern that no news would be
given out.
Even the fact, well-established
earlier in the day, that the firm
had virtually suspended, was a
topic oh which the manager and
the clerks were silent. Thev
would not admit nor would they
denv that failure had come.
CASH CAREFULLY COUNTED.
Until quite late the manager of the
house was absent Â£rbm the firm's
place of business, and he said that he
had been with Mr. Bolton. but a
search for the last named at the clubs
and at his home at the corner of Sac
ramento and Webster streets proved
to be unavailing. He could not be
found.
The banking section of the city is
practically deserted every evening af
ter 8 o'clock. The few pedestrians
who passed by the doors of Bolton,
De Ruyter & Co. last night were as
tonished at the signs of activity with
in the brightly lighted offices. Even
this was denied by the astute men in
the offices to indicate anything out of
the usual. The contents of the safe
were taken out a short time'before
midnight and the cash was all care
fully counted and the amount was en
tered on the books. Even then ..the
manager said that it was common for
the people in the office to work late
at night whenever there was a lively
market. '/. j
No information could be gained at
the offices concerning the identity of
the creditors nor of the amounts that
are due. Probably it will be ..found
that there are many creditors owing
to the nature and extent of the busi
ness.

PARTISAN FEELING
AT HIGHEST PITCH
Democrats Make an Issue of
the Action Regarding the
Extradition of Taylor in the
Goebel Assassination Case
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â Indiana and
Kentucky locked horns in the House
to-day. The debate, which involved
nearly every member of both State
delegations, was fast and furious from
start to finish.
Kentucky demanded of Indiana the
return of W. S. Taylor that he might
be tried for the assassination of Wil
liam Goebel. The attack was made by
James of Kentucky, a"nd the de
fense was led by Crumpacker of
Indiana. Partisan feeling rose to an
extreme tension. The diplomatic ap
propriation bill was under considera
tion at the time.
Jumes fired both sides of the
House to interest and feeling by de
claring at the outset that the "Rough
Rider President" was ridiculous in his
message to Congress favoring interna
tional extradition treaties when
one State could not get an
other's fugitive from justice. He
had, he said, introduced a bill
in which the Federal Government
made extradition compulsory where
persons had been indicted fpr crime.
For four years, he said. Governor Dur
bin of Indiana had protected Taylor,
who had been regularly indicted in
Kentucky for the murder of Goebel,
"and yet I notice that when Durbin
comes to town," continued James,
â¢'he is wined and dined by this great
Don Quixote upon extradition, who
absolutely confides to Durbin the right
to give the waiting and anxious world
the news that Hanna can run for Pres
ident if he wants to. And when we
all read that we again declare 'The
King can do no wrong.' "
These remarks met with Democratic
applause and laughter, but stirred the
opposition to action, and for something
like two hours many members were
on their feet at a time, and the crim
inal and political records of both
Kentucky and Indiana were handled
without gloves. The Democrats main
tained that a State government had
no right to take the question of "fair
trial" into consideration in honoring
extradition papers from another Sta.te,
while the Republicans maintained
that history would justify Indiana's
action in this case.
When Crumpacker took the floor
in defense of Indiana he was be
get with a voiley of questions from the
Democratic side, and was hardly able
t<f maintain the thread of his argu
ment on account of interruptions. The
tension was lessened and better nature
restored by the interposition of a
speech on the reorganization of the
consular service by Adams of Penn
sylvania, but it afterward brokÂ«
out again under the lead of Stanley
of Kentucky, only to again be
quelled by a long speech against Cana
'dian reciprocity by Volstead of Minne
sota. , , . . _
The session was concluded at 5
o'clock by a ten-minute appeal by
Harrison of New York for equal treat
ment of American citizens abroad, es
pecially for American Hebrews in
Russia.
CORRESPONDENCE DELIVERED.
President Resi>onds to Gorman's Reso-
lution Regarding Colombia.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â The Presi
dent sent to the Senate to-day a mass
of correspondence in response to Sen
ator Gorman's resolution calling for the
dates and circumstances under which
the United States used forces in .the
affairs of New Granada, or Colombia,
and whether such uses of military
forces were on the initiative of the
United States or by the request of New
Granada or Colombia, or in consequence
of any official representation of either.
The resolution also called for copies of
orders by the Navy Department relat
ing to such use of military forces.
The circumstances undter which force3
were landed are given by the Presi
dent in detail, but orders by the War
and Navy departemnts concerning thd
workings of sueh departments and
which will constitute a part of the rec
ords of the officers of the military and
naval intelligence bureaus are withheld
on the ground that the disclosure of
such confidential information would be
incompatible with the country's inter
ests. The President? in His letter of
transmittal says:
The correspondence since November 16, 1002,
referred to In the letter of the Secretary of
the Navy, which has not already been trans
mitted to the Senate, has no reference to tho
matters covered by the â¢ resolutions and deals
with military srovernments. and for that rea
son It Is deemeed Incompatible with the public
Interest to make it public at this time. ,
'. As a preface to the correspondence
Acting Secretary of State Loomis writes
a letter in which he says all the cor
respondence on record in the Depart
ment of State is given and that from
this it appears the United States forces
have been landed on the isthmus of
Panama ten times. Acting Secretary
Loomis says further:
The accompanying papers also show, as a
reply to the second request of the Senate reso
lution, that the United States has been re
quested by New Granada or Colombia to exe
cute by armed forces the guaranty of the neu
trality of the isthmus or of the sovereignty
of New Granada or of Colombia, and the dates
and circumstance* of such requests, particu
larly by the notcis from â¢ the Granadlan lepa
tion of May, 1869; June 20, 1862; September
18 1S62, and from the Colombian legation of
April 2 and 4, 186. r >.
In reply to the third request of the resolu
tion It appears from the correspondence that
on one occasion United States forces were
landed solely on the initiative of the United
States, namely. In September, 1902, when the
Panama authorities were duly notified of the
proposed landing-
The correspondence further shows, as a re
ply to the fourth rrqueBt of the Senate reso
lution, that the forces of the United States
have never been employed tn the Internal af
fairs of New Granada or Colombia otherwise
than to protect United States property and
maintain order and the freedom of the transit
on the Isthmian territory under the provisions
of the treaty of 1848. .::'Z*'\
The State Department letters are
thirty-six in number. The first is dated
October 2, 1856, and the last October i6,

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 3.â Governor
Pardee this afternoon announced his
refusal to interfere in the case of Wil
liam Glover, who *is~ to, be executed at
Folsom prison on Friday next for the
murder of a Placer County farmer
named Nierhoff.
Glover had be.en keeping company
with Miss Agnes Nierhoff, when her
father ordered him to no longer call on
her. A few days later Oscar Glover, a
brother, was engaged in conversation,
with Nierhoff on the latter's place when
William Glover suddenly emerged from
the farmer's house with the latter's gun
in his hand. He raised it and shot Nier
hoff, who lingered for several days.
Nierhoff declared in his dying state
ment that the shooting was wholly un
provoked.
Oscar Glover testified that his broth
er had acted in self-defense, and in this
claim Miss Nierhoff agreed until the
trial, when she swore that her father's
murder was deliberate and uncalled
for. She testified that her former state
ments were made under threats . of
death from the Glover brothers.

for a loan of $1,600,000 to the St. Louis
Exposition to get through without any
discussion whatever, the Senate to-day
changed its tactics just as the vote was
about to be taken and began a debate
on the loan provision, which continued
for about four hours and was still in
progress when the Senate adjourned for
the day.
The debate was precipitated- by a
point of order made against the amend
ment by Mr. Bailey, who maintained
that the National Government was not
as such, concerned with the success or
failure of any exposition. He was sup
ported by Lodge and Elkins, while
speeches were made in support of the
amendment by Hale, Allison, Cockrell,
Spooner, McComas and others.
The debate took a political turn at
one time. Gorman took advantage of a
.declaration that the condition of the
treasury was such as to render it un
wise to enter upon this expenditure to
charge the party in power with mis
management. Spooner replied in de
fense of the administration. The de
bate throughout was spirited but good
natured, and the galleries were well en
tertained.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â President
Roosevelt, General John C. Black, the
commander in chief of the Grand Army
of the Republic; Secretary Taft, Gen
eral Nelson A. Miles and other well
known officials were guests of honor at
the banquet to-night to the Department
of the Potomac of the G. A. R.
The President arrived at -the banquet
hall shortly after 10 o'clock and was
given a cordial reception. He listened
to a patriotic speech by General Black
and then was introduced to the large
assemblage. The . President spoke for
about half an hour. He paid a tribute
to the G. A. R. and its work, and in a.
general way spoke of the duties of citi
zenship and the lessons taught by the
Civil War.
In the beginning of his speech the
President said he had made it a point
because of the pressure of official du
tfes not to accept social invitations this
winter, but he added that when It
comes to a dinner given by the G. A. R.,
with the commander in chief as-ita
guest, nice customs must courtesy to a

WRECK OF TRAIN
AVERTED BY ACCIDENT
Freight Crew Makes Timely Discovery
of an Open Switch on the
Oregon Short Line.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 3. â A well
planned attempt to wreck the east
bound passenger train No. 1 on the
Oregon Short Line was made. Sunday
night at a point seven miles west of
Wiss, Idaho, and but for the fact that
the fast passenger train was a few
minutes late it would have dashed into
an open switch at a fifty-mile gait and
been hurled into a deep ditch. The
fact that the train was late enabled a
freight train to get to the danger spot
first and resulted in the discovery of
the turned switch in time to avert a
disastrous wreck. The railroad de
tectives are making a searching inves
tigation and expect to make arrests in
a. few days.
That a deliberate attempt was made
to wreck the train there is no doubt.
The switch had been turned but a few
â minutes before the discovery and
placed in such a position that it would
throw the train Into the ditch. The
freight happened ttk. reach the side
track ahead of the passenger train
and stopped short, prepared to get out
of the way of No. 1. Then,' the train
crew Â«iisÂ»covered the' turned switch. It
was readjusted and No. 1 thundered
past in safety, two minutes later.
RANCHER AND HIS< WIFE
VICTIMS OP A MURDERER
Assassin Shoots Them While They Are
Grossing From Chemainus to Their
Home on Kuper Island.
NANAIMO, B. C, Feb. 3.â The bod
ies of Charles Wilson, a wealthy
rancher, and his wife came ashore at
Chemainus this morning in an Indian
canoe. The unfortunate couple were
the victims of one of the most brutal
crimes in the history of Nanaimo.
They left Chemainus, a suburb of this
place, yesterday to cross to their home
cm Kuoer Island, and a party of log
gers discovered their canoe on the
beach this morning riddled with bul
lets and bespattered with blood. Lying
in the bottom were the bodies of Wil
son and his wife, the flesh torn to rib
bons and the skulls crushed in. The
shots had been fired at close range and
the murderer evidently finished his
terrible work with the butt end of a
gun. â¢ Â«.
Wilson was known to carry large
sums of money, which fact possibly
furnishes the motive for the crime. A
posse has been organized and the
the woods and shore are being scoured
for a clew. to the assassin.

REPLY TO BE PACIFIC.
Russia Will Grant Everything Con
sistent With Dignity.
PARIS. Feb. 4.â The Revue Russe
says it has just received Authoritative
information showing that Russia is
resolutely maintaining a pacific policy
and" in the note about to be transmitted
to, Japan she hfis mad* all the conces
sions compatible with dignity. Russia
will declare therein, the paper contin
ues, that her interests in connection
with the railroad are too great for her
not to insist upon occupying a position
which will enable her to protect this
costly enterprise, but she recognizes
algo the ri?ht of Japan to develop^ ex
tend and create outlets in Manchuria
as well as m Korea. The contents in
the Russian note, the Revue Ruase
avers, are known in Tokio, where they
have created a most favorable impres
sion. In any case, the paper concludes,
Russia has decided not to engage Japan
unless she is directly attacked.
The Matin this morning quotes what
it terms a â¢"high English authority" for
the following statement:
"If Japan seeks to begin war by re
jecting Russia's forthcoming response
Great Britain will use all her influence
to hold her back."
A dispatch from Port Arthur to the

JAPAN'S STATESMEN CONFER.
Meeting Is Believed to Foreshadow
Important Events.
TOKIO. Feb. 3. â A specially sum
moned conference of the Cabinet,
elder statesmen and military and
naval chiefs "was held to-day at the
residence of Premier Katsura. The
meeting is believed to have been of
much importance, though no details of
the discussion have been made public.
Possibly it foreshadows energetic ac
tion on account of Rusian proscratina
tion.
Although the Government officials
continue reticent, it is manifest that
the Fituation is of the gravest and that
a crisis is near at hands The time in
which the Russian reply will continue
to be a factor in the situation is nar
rowing. The patience of the Govern
ment is becoming exhausted and if the
expected answer is delayed many days
longer the Issuance of an ultimatum
by Japan will become inevitable. The
Japanese feel that the existing condi
tions have entitled â¢ them to a more
prompt reply and are bound to infer
that the St. Petersburg Government is
determined not to yield, but it utilizing
the time to advance its preparations
for war.

Russia Continues to Increase Her
Stock of Coal,
TIENTSIN, Feb. 3.â In the event of
an outbreak of hostilities between Rus
sia and Japan, the railroad adminis

ing stock of the extra-mural line inside
the great wall.
Russia has ordered another 20,000 tons
of Kaiping coal for delivery at Port
Arthur, making 70,000 tons in a week.
It is pointed out that if war breaks
out soon the coal will hardly reach its
destination, as the stocks here are low
and the steamers scarce.
It Is reported that the Russians are
building a railroad to connect Mukden
with Sinminting, thirty miles west of
Mukden, on the railroad running to

St. Petersburg Newspaper Blames
Uncle Sam for the Trouble.
LONDON, Feb. 4. â Special dispatches
received here from the Far East and
published this morning add nothing
to the knowledge of the actual situa
tion.
The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Daily Telegraph quotes from the
Novoe Vremya a bitter editorial at
tack upon the United States, which he
supposes to De an outcome of the dis
patch of American Consuls to Mukden
and Antungr. The Novoe. Vremya ac
cuses the United States of a desire to
win the hegemony of the entire globe
and exclude Europe from the Far East
ern market, and declares "if, as it
seems likely, war breaks out, it will
have been instigated by th e Yankees
with their utilitarian views."
Baron Hayashi, Japanese Minister
to Great Britain, described the situa
tion in the Far East as "certainly very
threatening," but said everything de
pended upon Russia's reply. "It is
highly improbable," the Minister con
tinued, "that Russia will make any
aggressive move before the Japanese
Government has received and consid
ered Russia's reply. What Russia
wishes to do is to throw the responsibil
ity of taking the initiative upon
Japan." The foregoing utterances
LORENZ OWED
MACHEN MONEY
. WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â Shortly be
fore adjournment to-day counsel for
the defense in the postal trial produced
a note dated July 1, 1883, for $25,000
drawn by George E. Lorenz in favor of
August *W. Machen. In . the opening
statement of the defense Kumler, in
behalf of Lorenz, said he would prove
the existence of an indebtedness of this
amount on the part of Lorenz to Ma
chen. The note, he said to-day, was
offered for this purpose and explained
various remittances forwarded by
Lorenz to Machen. A hundred or more
notes, aggregating over $53,000, were
identified by President S. D. Carr of
the National Bank of Commerce of To
ledo, as having been discounted by his
bank on the indorsement of Lorenz and
his brother and Machen, tha loans hav
ing been made to enable them to de
velop their oil properties in Wood
County, Ohio. Carr further testified
that Machen had sold out his Interest
to Lorenz, the bank "thereafter accept
ing the single indorsement of George
E. Lorenz.
Earlier in the day Dlller B. Groff pro
duced various checks in favor of his
brother as evidence that he had paid
him all That was due as his share of
the profits. Groff explained his failure
to send remittances to Lorenz after
November, 1902, by the fact that the
Government still owed Groff Brothers
$13,000 and that it was necessary to pay
the manufactruers of the fasteners. J.
H. McGill, a patent attorney, testified
that the Miller device, which had been
referred to In the course of the trial,
was an Infringement of the Groff fast

COURSE OF IRISH PARTY
Ireland's lender Says There Is No
Such Thins as an Alternative to
Home Rule.
LONDON, Feb. 3.â "For the Irish
party there is no such thing as an al
ternative policy to home rule," declared
John Redmond, the leader of the Irish
Parliamentary party, in the House of
Commons to-day as he resumed debate
on the address in reply to the speech
from ; the throne. Redmond proceeded
to detail the various grievances of Ire
land, incidentally informing the Liber
als that it was delusion to suppose they
could count on Irish support by prom
ising an alternative policy to the home
rulers. ; Because the Irish obtained an
act last year remedying some of the
evils of past governments some persons
seemed to think that the Irish question
was shelved, but^ no concession could
weaken the bill for self-government.
On the contrary, every concession they
had obtained or might obtain would be
used for the â¢ furtherance of the contest
for'home rule. The Irish would rather
govern themselves badly than be gov
erned well by another nation. . -

COLONEL IiUTAVEIN SAFE
IN HIS OWN LINES
Governor of German Southwest Africa
Returns After Subduing the
Bondelztvarts.
BERLIN, Feb. 3. â The following ca^
blegram has been received from Swak
opmund, German Southwest Africa,
from the commander of the German
gunboat Habicht:
"The garrisons at Windhoek and Oka
handja have been relieved by Franke's
company with two guns. The relief
of Okahandja occurred January 27,
Emperor William's birthday, and was
without losses.
"On January 28 there occurred a ter
rific battle between the gallant little
German force and the enemy, who
numbered thousands. The engagement
lasted for six hours and ended with the
storming of the main camp of the en
emy, situated on Kaiser Wilhelm
Mountain. Four Germans were wound
ed. After this defeat the enemy with
drew to the Otjisangati hills, but we
succeeded in getting away all â¢ the
stolen cattle. The enemy devastated
all the farms and the railroad stations
in the Windhoek and Okahandja dis
tricts, a portion of Karibib and the
barracks of the mountain battery at
Johann Albrecht Heights. The losses
so far are known to be forty-four set
tlers, including women and children,
killed, and in most cases the bodies
were mutilated. The military losses
amount to twenty-six and there have
been fifty other fatalities. It is prob
able that Catadis has been besieged
since January 16. The march on Omar
urair will be begun to-morrow. Colonel
Leutwein, Governor of German South
west Africa, is expected here by
steamer on February 5. Lieutenant
Winkler has arrived here with supports
from the steamer Ernest Woennann."
This news was circulated here in ex
tra editions of the papers to-night and
caused universal rejoicing.
BERLIN, Feb. 3. â Later advices cor
rected the first statement made in re
gard to the whereabouts of Colonel
Leutwein. saying he arrived recently
at Port Xolloth, Cape Colony, and
afterward sailed for Swakopmund,
where he is due to arrive February 5.
A cablegram has .been received here
from the commander of the German
gunboat Habicht, saying that the gar
risons at Windhoek and Okahandja
have been relieved. The latter place
was taken by storm. The tribesmen
killed and in most cases mutilated
forty-four settlers, including women
and children. The military losses were
twenty-six, and it is probable that the
death list has been Increased by fifty
casualties. On January 28 the principal
camp of the tribesmen was on Kaiser
Wilhelm Mountains.

OAKLAND, Feb. 3. â The route of
the Western Pacific Railroad through
Alameda ' County has been settled.
More deeds have been filed and they
show the route and show by what line
the Western Pacific will find its way
from the San Joaquin Valley to tide
water on the Oakland side of the bay.
The Western Pacific will absorb the
coal road that extends from Stockton
to Tesla. The line of the franchises
secured by the company in Oakland
shows the route from the foot of Union
street along Third, into East Oakland
and along Twelfth street, from Thir
teenth to Twenty-third avenues. Re
cently deeds were filed that show
the route of the road from Dublin up
the Redwood Canyon, but the connect
ing links were not known until noÂ»v.
ROUTE IS KNOWN. "
The route can now be definitely an
nounced. The line of the coal road
from Stockton to Tesla will be used
and a tunnel through Corral Hollow
Pass will be built. It- will .be about
7000 feet long. The line to Liverraore
is almost straight from the western
portal of the tunnel and the depot site
has already been secured in Livermore,
a little east of the depot of the South
ern . Pacific Company. . From Liver
more the line to Dublin will be almost
straight, following the line of the old
overland road from Stockton.
It was thought that tha road would
reach the western side of the hills,
through the Hay.wards Pasa into Hay
wards, but the town of Haywards will
be left upon the sidetrack. Before the
summit is reached in the Haywards
Pass the road will swing northward
through the old Redwood road and
along the banks of San Leandro Creek.
It will cross Crow Creek and Cull Creek
and will follow the line of one of the
oldest sections of Alameda County un
til the old Redwood Schoolhouse is
reached. From there the road will
swing westward and will cross the di
vide with a tunnel about 300 feet long
and drop down the western slope of
the Contra Costa hills, back of Laun
dry Farm. 1
TWO OPTION'S OUT. "
: This is the only point where the
rights of way have not been completed
and it is said that there are two op
tions out, one for the line now oper
ated by the Leona Heights branch of
the Oakland Transit Company and one
for an independent right of way. The
tunnel through the hills will be on the
Hewston place and the line swings
down the hillside through the Hews
ton place and several big tracts now
controlled by the Realty Syndicate
and into Fruitvale at the junction of
East Twelfth street and Fruitvale ave
nue, where the franchise from the city
of Oakland ends.
The people of Haywards and San
Leandro are disturbed over this sud
den change of the overland route, but
the statement Is made by those who
arefjiitertsted -in securing the rights
of way for the road that the people
of Haywards wanted S 80.000 for the
right of way through that city and
San Leandro wanted as much more,
and that the road was compelled to
abandon its plans in that direction and
go up the eastern side of the hills and
cross nearer Fruitvale.
The Oakland City Council has ob
jected to the slowness with which the
new road completed its work. Valu
able franchises wejje granted through
the city of Oakland and just enough
work was done upon these franchises
to hold them for a year. The City
Council has notified the new road that
it will have to begin its work in earn
est or steps will be taken toÂ»revoke
the franchises. As yet no answer has
been received from the railroad. It is
generally believed that the amount
spent for rights of way in this county
is a guarantee that the road is going
to be built. â¢ . "-- * .

posed all along that it was a relic of a
building where the university was born in
Oakland. This turns out to be a myth, for
the sign was only one that the owner of a
dance hall had painted, with an eye to busi
ness.- The sign will not be brought to Berke

FINANCES RUNNING LOW
President Wheeler Consents
to Use of Open Air Theater
for Chorus of 3000 Voices
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center street, Feb. 3.
Berkeley is In such sore need of funds
Just now that it . cannot spare the
money. to buy books for the juvenile
department in the new Carnegie library,
but the children of Ihe schools, 3000
of them, are going: to raise the amount
needed with their voices. They will
literally sing for the money, and like
the sirens of old, no doubt, charm a
good pile of it into the consuming maw
of the city's treasure box. Best of all.
each child will have a sort of proprie
tary interest in the Juvenile department
he helped to found, for it will be his
voice that will have helped to buy the
books.
This concert of little voices is to be
given in the new Greek Theater at the
University of California on Friday
afternoon, February 25. President
Wheeler gave his consent to it to-day
to the board of library trustees and
wished them success. Practice for the
novel undertaking will begin at once
In all the schools. Assistance is prom
ised from two or three people interested
in music and a good deal of the work
will be taken off the teachers' hands.
The idea of giving the concert sprang
from the mind of School Superintendent
S. D. Waterman, who is also president
of- the library board. His suggestion
that the Greek Theater would be a good
place for it met with instant favor and
application was made at once to Presi
dent Wheeler with the happy result
stated.
"We need 5000 additional books for
the juvenile room," said Mr. Waterman
to-day, "and there isn't a cent to buy
them with. We ought to give a verv
successful concert with the children,
not only financially but artistically."

A Preparation Discovered That Will J>e-

For some time it has been known that
dandruff is caused by a germ that digs
up the scalp into little white flakes, and
by sapping the vitality of the hatr at the
root, causes falling hair, and, of course,
finally baldness. For years there have
beer* all kinds of hair stimulants and
scalp tonics on the market, but there has
been no permanent cure for dandruff un-
til the discovery of a preparation called
Newbro's Herpicide, which destroys the
dandruff germ. Destroy the cause, the
effect will cease to exist. Kill the dan-
druff germ and you'll have no dandruff,
no itehinsr scalp, no falling hair. Sold by

CLALLAM CASE
IS SUBMITTED
MaMne Inspectors Conclude
the Investigation Into the
Loss of Ill-Fated Steamer
CAPTAIN ON THE STAND
Owing to Mass of Testimony
Taken, a Decision Will Not
Be Given for Several Weeks
SEATTLE, Feb. 3.â Captain George
Roberts, master of the Clallam, again
occupied the witness chair to-day dur
ing the steamship disaster inquiry and
his testimony closed the Investigation.
It was the first and only time he was
recalled. He held to his original story
throughout, despite the cross-question
ing of the marine inspectors and Chief
Engineer de Launay. In the course of
his testimony Captain Roberts flatly
contradicted the evidence of Henry
Jensen, a deckhand of the Clallam, to
the effect that the latter had delivered
a message to him from De Launay re
specting the condition of affairs in. the
engineer's department, and especially
regarding the broken deadlight.
The investigation closed after eight
days of testimony taking. While a
transcript has already been made of
much of the testimony, the Inspectors
will probably not be able to review it
and render their decision for ten days
or two werÂ»ks.
Captain Roberts was questioned after
telling his story again by Chief En
gineer de Launay. De Launay wanted
to know of Captain Roberts how he
knew or the condition of the pumps,
and Roberts replied: "You told me the
pumps choked up."
Roberts declared, answering De Lau
nay on the question of the efficiency
oZ the ' Clallam's rudder, that the
"vessel steered as well as she ever
did." Having asked Captain Robert*
various questions respecting the rud
der, and having received unsatisfac
tory replies, De. Launay, addressing
the captain, said: "It is very evident,
Captain Roberts, that these gentlemen
w<ll hold me responsible for this acci
dent."
"I object to any conclusions you
have." Inspector Whitney interposed,
but De Launay continued, "I am posi
tive. Captain Roberts, that no man
will ever convince you that t l was re
sponsible."
Captain Roberts declared that in
giving his testimony he had told noth
ing but the truth, to which De Launay
answered: 'I hope you have a clear
conscience."
"I have," replied Roberts. "I was
taught from childhood to tell the
truth."
STEAMSHIP AND SCHOONER
REPRESENTATIVES CONFER
Owners of Rival Transportation Com
panies Hope to Effect a Satisfac
tory Compromise To-Day.
Robert Dollar and William J. Wood
side, representing the steam schooner
interests; Manager Pierce, the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company; E. O. Mc-
CormJck. the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and a representative of Wells,
Fargo & Co., met in the offices of the
Jatter company yesterday afternoon to
further deliberate over the proposed
compromise of the existing difficulties
between the schooner owners ana" the
steamship company growing out oJ
their competition in coast passenger
traffic. Passenger Traffic Manager E.
O. McCormick was present somewhat
as a moderator, for E. H. Harriman
iias decreed that the fight between the
schooner owners and the steamship
company shall not be carried to a
point where it will jeopardize the lum
ber interests of the coast. As a result
of the railroad company's threats to
enter the fight in the event of hostili
ties being carried too far, the contend
ing parties have both suggested meas
ures'for a compromise and it is expect
ed that they will arrive at some satis
factory, arrangement to-day whereby
the threatened cut in passenger prices
and the tariff on lumber shipments
will be avoided.
Thief Rifles Register.
A thief rifled the cash register of the
Windsor Hotel on Market street yes
terday morning shortly after 4 o'clock
and secured $9 45 in cash and three
valuable diamond rings. The method
employed was a particularly bold one.
Tuesday afternoon a man giving the
name of Frank. Ree.d rented a room
from the clerk and said he would re
turn later. About 4 o'clock- yesterday
morning he put in an appearance and
asked to be shown to his room. The
night clerk. P. Shorten, although
somewhat suspicious of the fellow
from his general appearance, went to
the room with him. Upon lighting the
gas it was found that the tip was out
and they returned to the office to se
cure another one. Reed stepped out
side â  and disappeared down Market
street. Shorten upon going to the
register a few minutes later discovered
that' during his absence Reed's con
federate had been busy with the cash
register. "

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 4. 1904, N
UNTRAINED MISSOURIAN
FALLS TO A DICE GAME
Complains to Police of Loss of $100 and Noted
Criminal Is Taken Into Custodyâ Ministers Ap
pear to Testify Against Alleged Cruel Driver
John X-undgrin is the original "K.
C. Kid," who has the temerity to ad
mit that Missouri is his birthplace.
When he climbed over the rail fence
of his native hemp patch and conclud
ed to seek adventure it became, nec
essary to put his trunk aboard a train
through a cattle chute for fear he
would stampede. Then he went from
bad to worse, until he finally became
a resident of Kansas City.
Recently he reformed and made a
trip to San Francisco. Here he fell
into the hands of friends. Two men
met him on Mission street and treated
him in a princely manner. They
bought him beakers of foaming steam
beer for three days and finally to ce
ment their friendship they gave him
an opportunity to win their money
on January 23 last in the saloon of
Tom Sawyer at 935 Mission street.
All he had to do was to count the
spots on the tops of five dice and
make a wager whether or not the
spots on the bottom of the dice ex
ceeded his count. He waa given
either end of the proposition he want
ed.. The only trouble he had was with
the limit. When he guessed right
only a small amount was wagered,
but when he was wrong there was no
limit to the amount he was allowed to
bet. It was the old "top and bottom
game." which has been in existence
since the first Babylonian framed two
dice from the tooth of a dlnosaurus
and skinned his trusting friend out
Â»f an ichthyosaurus overcoat. Alto
gether Lundgrin was loser to the
amount of 5100.
P. F. Sullivan and John Reynolds
were arrested Tuesday night by De
tectives Ryan and Taylor for bunko
ing Lundgriri and the two defendants
were before Judge Fritz yesterday.
The complaining witness was "not in
court, but it was shown by Arthur
Mack, attorney for Reynolds, that
Lundgrin was positive that Reynolds
was not one of the men who shook
dice with him. Accordingly Reynolds
was released on the nominal ball of
$5. Sullivan waa held in â¢ bonds of
$1000. T<
Sullivan is JMe man who stabbed
and killed Charles Barr, a well-known
commercial traveler, in front of the
bar of -the old Baldwin Hotel on July
13, 1895. The crime created an im
mense sensation In the city at the
time. He was convicted of man
slaughter and sentenced to ten years'
imprisonment in San Quentln. Before
that he had served a term in Colorado
for a similar offense.- . \
Church dignitaries mingled with the
scum of the police courts before Judge
Conlan yesterday during the trial of
E. D. Fie'l, who was accused of cru
elty, to animals.. The complaining
witnesses were Rev. S. H. Wingfield
Digby. whose card proclaims him as
of Chnist Church, Oxford, and Rev.
Charles Bruce. Both of the clergy
men are connected with the Seamen's
Institute at 33 Steuart street.
Last Thursday they were out driv
ing and claim to have seen Fiel give
an unmerciful beating to a horse he
was driving-. They said he struck
him with a scantling: eight feet long
that raised welts. on the animal's body
which were as conspicuous as a re
spectable man on the Barbary Coast.

there were no bruises on the animal.
He was corroborated by several wit

performance of asking the assembled
bums up to the bar for "just one
more."
When he laid a greenback down on
the bar in payment one of his newly
made friends would gather up. the
change and hand it to him. With qau
tion born of long experience he would
slip the silver into the waistband of his
drawers and thence it would progress
safely to his shoes. He wasn't count
ing the change, : but he kept a : keen
outlook on his shoes.
Regan heard about the good thing
and dropped Into the saloon casually.
He saw Kenny, put up a $5 bill for
nine beers and a man named Charles
McCarthy carefully gathered up the
change. Regan stopped the deal for
a minute until he had ascertained that
McCarthy, in the o role of paying teller,
had held out Jl 50. Then he arrested
him for petty larceny.
McCarthy told Judge Mogan yes
terday that Kenny wds an old friend of
his and voluntary gave- him the
money to pay .his passage to Fairfax.
Then the deluge came for McCarthy.
Kenny had been arrested for drunken
ness and was still in the City Prison.
He was escorted down to the court
room and testified that he had never
seen McCarthy before and" never had
given him money voluntarily.
McCarthy was found guilty and his
next journey will not be to Fairfax,
but out to a resort nor' nor' by west,
where bad men are sequestered.
Herman Hohn, in distress at the
grief of an aged mother, has placed
himself in a distressful state. He
conducts a grocery at 1301 Buchanan
street and cashed a check for Henry
Brannan for the amount of $75. The
check purported to be signed by Paul
Jones and was drawn on the First Na
tional Bank of Reno^Nev. A telegram
from the bank disclosed the fact that
Paul Jones was a mythical person.
Hohn swore out a warrant against
Brannan for felony embezzlement.
When the newspapers published the
fact that Brannan had been arrested
Hohn received word from the de
fendant's mother that she would pay
the amount of the check. In consid
eration of $75 he surrendered all the
documentary evidence in the case and
yesterday was in Judge Mogan's court
to state that he-did not desire any fur
ther prosecution. *
When he was questioned concerning
the check he admitted having given it
to an 84-year-old -woman, who wished
to save her boy from the penitentiary.
He was told by the Judge that he had
put himself in the way of committing
a grave offense in the matter of com
pounding a felony, but no further ac
tion was taken. The fact that ti
mother's tears had influenced him to
dispose of the evidence was taken
into consideration. Brannan's case
was continued until February 5 for
further investigation.
Samuel Bowers went into a restau
rant at 211 Sixth" s\reet Tuesday night
and ordered "ham and â .". There was
a conspicuous sign on the wall an
nouncing that "ham andâ" was as
sessed at 15 cents. Bowers wanted to
pay only 10 cents after he had finished
his repast. The proprietor took a long,
premeditated swing at Bowers' eye and
knocked him out into the middle of the
street. Then Bowers walked up and
down in front of theplace, crying "Un
fair house" and. other things that may
not go into print. A policeman came
along and took 'Bowers into custody.
In view of the fact that Bowers had
spent one night in jail, had a black
eye and had really eaten those eggs
along with the ham, he was given his
liberty with a warning never again to
indulge his appetite beyond his means.
Attorney Archie Campbell pleaded
guilty to petty larceny before Judge
Mogan yesterday on behalf of his client,
Lillle Langtry, who has dropped out of
sight of the police until the harvest
days are over in her case. She was
originally accused of grand larceny, but
the prosecuting witness, John Muller
by name, admitted that the money he
alleged was taken from him was
promptly returned at his demand, even
before he called in the police to prose
cute- the case. A fine of $25 was as
sessed, and Miss Langtry may now re
turn to the city and resume her career.
Peter Pretonious, George Batsakis,
Peter Pelonious and John Conecols

The suit of former Public Adminis
trator John Farnham to oust from of
fice M. J. Hynes, his successor, was
given a hearing by Judge Sloss yester
day. The~evidence given by Farnham.
the first; withness examined, showed
that he had been just as neglectful as
Hynes and had not been even as
prompt as the latter in filing his bond.
He said that lie did not file his cer
tificate : of election until January 2.
1902, and that he did not file his bond
until fourteen days later. : He also tes
tified that he simply brought hi* oath
of office to the office of the County
Clerk and had it marked .filed and
then look it; to the Auditor's office and
left It there, thus showing that It had
really never been filed with the County
Clerk, as the law provides that It must
be left with that official. I
Farnham's evidence was also a body
blow to his : suit, as it was simply, an
admittance that. he had done the very
things he claims, should disqualify
Hynes. The other evidence taken at
the hearing -was also against Farnham.

Sp^ulati^n in the minds of many is
gambling. It is frequently said of men
uhi ?n?rulat<Â» On t ne Board of Trade
or St<rk Exchange that "th^y gam
ble," of that "they are garrÂ»b!Â«?rs." In
other words, the public has fallon into
the idea that sp^ulatiin and gambJtng
are synonyrr.our. But l^t us rovers-?
the proposition. Whoever h<Â»ard it
charged that a man who visited a. pool-;
room or a faro hante. or who â¢Â«at in"
a poker gamp, did *â¢â¢> for the purpose
of speculating. So the two words
"{rambling" and "speculation" are not
synonymous, for they cannot be used
intrrrhanp^ably. '.
Speculation is a necessity. In proof
of This statement I refer tbÂ»Â» reader to
the report of what was known as the
industrial commission, appointed by
Congress in 1SSS. This commission la
bored for three years. Its first chair
man was the late Senator Kyle of
South Dakota, who was originally a
strong granger and Populist, and as
such opposed to speculation in farm
products. After a thoi^ugh investiga
tion a report was adopted and con
curred in by every member bf the com
mission, which unreservedly took the
pround that th<? grain speculator ren
dered almost indispensable services to
the farmer in the distribution of crops.
Somebody, the report stated, must
take the speculative risks of changes
in the market between the time when
the crops are harvested and the time
when they are used b;.- the consumer.
The farmer might store his grain him
gelf, but he would have to Insure it
and take the chances of loss in various
forms. This ould require more cap
ital than he possesses, and if he were
to borrow for this haphazard purpose
be -would have to pay higher interest
than before. For similar reasons the
Â« nsumer cannot store the grain in
large quantities and keep it until he is
ready to use it.
The result is that a separate class
of experts has been developed who
make it their business to store the
crops and take the chances of loss
and gain involved In that calling. In
other words, the speculators of the
corn and wheat pits are the dis
tributers of the nation's farm pro
ducts. The commission found that
these men did the work on a closer
margin. of cost than the farmer could
do it. Thus the producer gets bet
ter prices and the consumer gets
cheaper bread than if there were no
professional speculators. Intense com
petition among the dealers themselves
lends constantly to cut down their
own profits and to bring the producer
and the consumer closer together. The
dealers are forced constantly to seek
to reduce the risks of their business,
xvhile the mails and the telegraph en
able the farmer to keep informed as
to the latest conditions of Â«he market.
The grower can convert his crop
quickly into cash capital and turn his
attention to preparing for the next
crop, leaving the speculators to attend
to the risks and worries of distribu
tion.
Before future delivery trading, as
now practiced on the various boards
of trade was established, every coun
try grain dealer was a speculator in
cash grain and had to contend with all
the uncertainties of the markets. To
day he can work on an assured margin
of profit by making sales for future
delivery. To illustrate: A dealer in
Iowa buys 10,000 bushels of ear corn
in January of farmers and store it in
his own crib. It will be spring be
fore 't is fit to shell and ship, but the
dealer orders the commission mer
chant on the Chicago Board of Trade
Co Bell 10,000 bushels of corn for May
delivery. Thus he has secured his
I roflt, although he does not have to
deliver the corn in Chicago for five
months?, the length of time it will
take to cure. The dealer has made
what the. public would call a specula
tive transaction, but he is certainly
not a speculator. For' has he not
eliminated the risk of changes which
would possibly occur within the five
months? In the same 'way millers
and grain dealers throughout the world
trade in "futures" in Chicago in order
to avoid speculating in their business.
Ccnfusjon reigns fo generally in
court .decisions and the minds of the
public, and the press that one cannot
but reach the conclusion that there
has been a lack of intelligent investi
gation, and education as to the func
tions of speculation. Take, for in
stance, a case where one sees a chance
to make a profitable deal on a corner
lot. He does not buy the property out
right, but puts up a sura of money
which gives him the option of buying
it at a certain price, say in sixty days. A
week later he has an opportunity to
sell the lot for u larger sum than he
agreed to pay for it, and he does so,
niakins a profit on the transaction be
fore his'option matures. His transac
tion is just as much of a- speculative
character as the tfuying and selling of
grain and Ptocks on margins, yet who
ever thinks of branding the man who
speculates in real estate as a gambler?
fie is generally regarded as a benefac
tor, for by carrying a part of the "sur
plus area" hi? helps to increase the
value of the balance of thn !;md in his
rity, township or village.
A speculator on the Board of Trade
or Stock Exchange performs exactly
the same functions If he is a buyer of
farm products or securities. He re
lieves the market of lhe pressure of
whatsoever he may buy and thus aids
in preventing depression in values, and
yet if a. man with 510,000. put up as
margins, buys 100.000 bushels of
wheat, thereby providing a market for
this product of the farm, he is
"dubbed" a gambler, while in fact he
is performing the same service as the
land speculator.

ET MALCOLM Mo DO WELL.
(Autfccr of â¢'Shop Talk en the Wonders of the
Crafts.")
tOpyr'ght, I5Â»O4. by Joseph B. BowleM
Radio-activity is a scientific term
of elastic interpretation which has been
sadly overworked lately. Whenever
radium, uranium or thorium has been
mentioned, and they all have figured
largely in print recently, it is pretty
certain that "radio-activity" or "radio
active" has been used several times.
There has been so much of the purely
speculative and nonsensical written
abQut radium and its astonishing power
of spontaneously and naturally emit
ting wonderful rays for a time not yet
measured or known, without any ap
preciable change in the substances,
that the layman who is at all Interested
in such thinsrs is beginning to believe
that some scientists, like actresses,
have press agents in their trains.
It is evident that the earnest, sincere
men who discovered and are experi
menting with and testing the marvel
ous radio-active bodies are not to be
held responsible for the exaggerations
and wild speculations of uninformed
space fillers, for the men whose bril
liant achievements have startled the
scientific world are extremely conserv
ative in what they say or write about
themselves, their work and results.
But out of one of their laboratories
came a few words the other day: "It
may be that our investigations may
lead" us to the truth about electricity
and magnetism."
Many tintt-B men have believed they
held the solution of the mystery of elec
tricity. They have called it a fluid, an
emanation, an emission, a flux, a cur
rent; they have said it was etherlc
vibrations, waves of the equally mys
terious ether; they have thought it to
be molecular movement or a form of
energy which slid over conductors at
an unthinkable speed, like rubber bands
sliding over a lead pencil. They know
its effects; they have learned how to
handle it and make it do useful work,
but what it is is beyond them.
But when you come to think about it
magnetism is much more mysterious
to the ordinary citizen. The average
man has some sort of understandable
idea of a current of electricity. He at
least can sea the sparks and feel the
tingle of the "juice," but when he ob
serves a magnet at work and stops to
figure it out he just naturally gives it
up. He remembers in a hazy way that
when he was a high school scholar ne
learned that electricity and magnetism
were coupled together; that electricity
turned soft iron into magnets and that
magnetism started electric currents.
When a boy he carried a small horse
shoe magnet in his pocket or magne
tized a steel knife blade by rubbing it
with some other boy's magnet. There
is nothing brilliant or spectacular about
a magnet. It exercises its mysterious
power quietly. It is this unostentatious
characteristic which makes it so inter
esting to one who looks for the uncom
mon In common things.
Have vou ever considered the part
which the magnet plays in your every
day life? 'Did it ever occur to you that
without toe magnet ships would not at
tempt to navigate out of sight of land,
for the needle of the compass is a bar
magnet? Do you know how many mag
nets are in daily use in your home?
Every telephone and electric doorbell
has its magnet. Without magnets the
telegraph instruments would be silent,
telephone, exchanges would be closed,
fire departments would go back to high
watch towers, for there would be no
alarm boxes worth pulling. Without
magnets electric street cars would stop
running and electric lights would cease
to glow, for there would be no dyna
mos and electric motors.
Railroads would have to go back to
the days before they were paralleled by
telegraph wires, and hotels would be
compelled to return to the wire or cord
pulled bells of the old-time inn kind if
magnets should' be taken out of the
world. And, of course, all these things
xiould be if electricity should suddenly
suspend business, for the industrial
magnets are electro-magnets â pieces of
scft iron, wound around" with insulated
wire, to be made active magnets when
the electric current circles around the
inert iron through the wire.
Men knew of magnetism and em
ployed it long before any one aver
dreamed of electricity. It is pretty well
established that centuries ago the Chi
nese used the compass â it is believed
they invented " jt. The ancient Egyp
tians knew of \he power of the load
stone â the dark Iron gray mineral found
among 'some iron ores, to attract iron
to it. The old writers call the load
stone "leading stone," "quick iron" and
"lovestone." The Chinese have an an
cient tradition of a mountain of mag
netic ore which formed an island and
which drew out the Iron bands from
ships that chanced to come within the
limits of its attraction.
Magnetic chariots or wagons were
used in China as late as the fifteenth
century, and they were the compasses
which enabled Chinese travelers and
armies to cross great deserts and track
less plains. A chariot of this kind car
ried a little figure, a manikin, whose
outstretched arm ever pointed to the
southâ not the north, as points our
compass needle. A magnetized bar of
steelâ probably made magnetic by be
ing rubbed with a loadstone â was con
cealed in the pointing arm and was-del
icately pivoted. The bar magnet ranged
r.orth and south, but the Chinese put
the index finger on the south end. The
magnetic chariot was drawn in front of
the army, and thus served as a land
compass.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 4. 1001,
THE S A NFRiA^CLSCO CALL

LEADING HOME PAPER.
THE CALL takes a special pleasure in inviting the
attention of advertisers and the reading public gen
erally to its Sunday edition for the last day in
January. Not because that issue differs widely from
laic previous issues, but because it is one of the largest
editions in point of circulation outside of special holiday
numbers printed by this paper since it was established in
1856. Of the issue of Sunday, January 31, there were
printed and distributed 85,440 full and complete copies
of ' forty- four pages each. This enormous total is
equaled by only one other San Francisco paper, and the
number of daily publications, west of Chicago to reach
so large a distribution can be counted on the fingers of
one hand. The amount of paper required in its produc
tion exceeded fifty thousand pounds.
When the present proprietor assumed control of The
Call in 1897 its circulation did not exceed 45,000 copies,
and the Sunday issue was made up of from twenty-four
to twenty-eight pages; one press was required in its
production and the type was set by hand. At present
three Hoe quadruple presses are employed and the type
is set by sixteen Mcrgenthaler type-setting machines.
The magazine section alone is made up of sixteen pages
of the latest and best literature and contains numerous
examples of the best newspaper art work. , Last Sun
day's issue contained the first installment of Booth Tark
ington's most popular novel, "The Two Vanrevels," a
page of book notes and reviews, nine short stories by the
best fiction writers of the day, fashion articles for wo
men, important papers on the world at large, and two
piges devoted to the affairs of childhood. It is this
careful attention to the requirements of the reading
public, a superior news service at home and abroad, con v
sistent and conservative views expressed in its editorial
columns which have served to increase the paper's popu
larity and place it on the high road to success. .
Of the entire Sunday edition less than five per cent or
about 4000 copies went out free as exchanges, copies to
advertisers, office files, etc., leaving a net paid circulation
served by carriers, sent through the mail, sold by news
boys and at news stands and on trains, in excess of
81,000 copies. This is of a special value to users of ad
vertising space, as they are thus in possession of a posi
tive guarantee that their announcements were placed be
fore so large a number of regular paying subscribers.
On the very low estimate of three readers to each paper,
therefore, an advertiser was able to place his announce
ment .before a quarter of a million of people, each one
having many wants to be satisfied.
While making special reference to the Sunday issue
the daily edition of The Call must not be 'overlooked.
The total distribution of the daily edition, independently
of the Sunday issue, during 1003 was 19,103,674 copies,
an average daily circulation of 61,034. For months The
Call has devoted a large amount of space, time and
money to the preparation and publication of articles re
lating to the industries of the State, and particularly to
Central and Northern California. Large numbers of the
issues containing this special matter are bought by differ
ent organizations and distributed throughout the East,
creating an added interest in California's resources and
proving an important factor in inducing settlers to come
to the coast.
The advertising columns of The Call are kept as free
as possible from objectionable matter, and the paper is
established as the leading home paper of the Pacific
Coast. In fact, it may be safely claimed that it has a
larger percentage of its circulation in the homes of
people of intelligence and discrimination than any other
newspaper published in California. The circulation^ re
cords of The Call are al./ays open for the inspection of
legitimate advertisers.
As Joseph Chamberlain sat and listened to his de
fense delivered the other day in the House of Commons
by his son he had at least one splendid gratification.
While Austen Chamberlain, made the worst defense ever
attributed to a party in power in England, he gave an
example of the highest filiaKduty and allegiance. What
he lacks as a statesman he makes up as a son.
AMERICAN SHIPPING.
WHILE it is now probable that no effort will be
made in Congress to enact a comprehensive
bill for the promotion of the American mer
chant marine engaged in foreign commerce, until after
the report of. a commission to be appointed to investi
gate the whole subject, there is good prospect of the
passage of the Frye bill, proving for the extension of
our coastwise shipping "laws to the trade of the Philip
pines. The attainment of that much of justice for
American shipping would be the more encouraging be
cause it has, been opposed almost as vigorously as the
ship subsidy bill itself.
Among the elements of opposition there are two de
serving of special notice. One of these is made up
mainly of the cordage manufacturers of New England
and the other is found, strangely enough, in the "Mari
time Association of the Port of New York." The com
bination of these two forces in antagonism to a measurd
designed to promote *the carrying' of American com
merce in American ship's will help the public. to under
staife why it is that for so long a time the struggle for a
due mee*d of governmental assistance in the work of up
building our ocean merchant fleets has been made in
The plea of the cordage men was made not long ago
by the president of the Plymouth Cordage Company,
and was to the effect that "there is no American ship
ping adapted or available for this Philippine trade."
The trade he referred to is that between the Philip
pines and the *ports of the Atlantic Coast. It seems he
took no account of trade with Pacific Coast ports; or if
he did, he treated it as something antagonistic to that of
the Atlantic ports,, and therefore, in his judgment, not
deserving of promotion. .
In reviewing these statements W. L. Marvin, author
of "The American Merchant Marine," points out that the
cordage man was, mistaken as to the facts, there being
among, American ships available for trade between the
Philippines and bur Atlantic ports thirty-one steamers
of all siys, ranging from 1200 to -5000 tons net register,
and in addition more than a hundred sailing vessels. Mr.
Marvin goes on to say it mayÂ«be asked why these ships
are not engaged in the Philippine trade â  at present, and
answers: "For much the same reason why, before: the
Spanish war, there were no American steamers in the
trade between our Atlantic Coast and Hawaii and Porto
Rico. Foreigners, firmly intrenched in the business,
would have met the first American steamer with a sharp
reduction in rates, to be continued until the Yankees
had been driven out. of the traffic."
..So much for the opposition of the cordaee-men. As
for, that : manifest in the Maritime Association of the
Port of New York, it turns out to be due almost wholly
to the foreign element in the membership of the asso
ciation. In commenting on it the New York Commer
cial recently said:
"It is a source of deep and constant humiliation that
there should exist in New York to-day, an active, work
ing commercial body, a large proportion of whose mem
bers is composed of sworn enemies of American ship
ping interests and openly boasts of it. Imagine a mari
time association or exchange in London constantly
throwing obstacles in . the way of Great Britain's mari
time interests, or one in Hamburg laboring unceasingly
to promote American commerce as against that of the
German Empire! How long would either be tolerated?"
We have thus a revelation that a. measure designed to
promote a great American interest in the Pacific is op
posed by a narrow sectional feeling in New England
and a foreign influence in New York. Fortunately it
appears the combination will not be able to defeat the
bill, for, as we have said, all reports from Washington
tend to the conclusion fhat the ; measure will be duly
enacted by Congress at this session.
Dissolute, drunken, lawless Americans, says an au
thority, are one of the most serious problems of govern
ment and order in the Philippines. While we are meet
ing with tremendous difficulties in trying to induce the
Filipinos to accept what is best in our civilization it
certainly is monstrous to force our South Sea wards to
endure what is worst among us. A few Americans less
in the Philippines evidently would do the Filipinos and
us much good.
THE MORAL SENSE.
MR. BRYAN has assumed a new role. He presents
himself as a conscience, a moral sense, and de
sires to be used as what the Buddists call "the"
National Karma." To adopt an entomological and hor
ticultural figure he is a capri fig, into which the blas
tophaga conscience has crawled and the*national fig tree
will bear no fruit until the moral insect crawls out and
carries the true Bryan pollen with it.
In his address to the Holland Society in New York,
on Peace, he 'said: "The evils which afflict the body poli
tic are not due to the extraordinary- development of the
material resources of the world, but to the fact that the
moral sense has not always kept pace with industrial ex
pansion. But there is an awakening at hand."
Yes, there always is, for those who dolefully and con
tinually deplore their own age as the world's worst and
their own country as the worst of the age. If Mr. Bryan
have his way it is evident that we are, to havs another
campaign of deploring and detraction, in which those
who believe in their time and country must attack those
who don't. Mr. Bean's utterance is a bit mystical, but
what meaning it has runs to socialism. According to
that cult those who make profit and those who earn
should divide with those who don't.
Such an application of the conscience and moral sense
leads directly to individuaPweakness and national decay.
Men will not sow for non-sowers to reap, and they will
not reap for non-reapers to eat. Yet that is the com
mand-of Mr. Bryan's brand of conscience. That the
moral sense of this age and country is quickened and ac
tive is shown by proofs that abound. Labor hs? never
had as good reward as here. The lame, halt and blind
were never as kindly cared for as here. The young were
never as well educated, and the aged in better shelter
than here. The average man never commanded as much
of the comforts and luxuries of life as here. Yet Mr.
Bryan puts dust on his head and bellows!
Does the country need lectures on its moral sense
from him? Will its conscience be quickened by a man
who is at this moment striving with his might to take
$50,000 from a widow and children that he never earned
and to which he has not the slightest moral claim and
only a doubtful legal one? We think not. We think that
Mr. Bryan is not the man to defame his country and de
cry his countrymen, nor to usefully deplore the love of
money. He has been the beneficiary of much patience
and has been treated with great politeness by his coun
trymen. Before he requites this by calling attention to
their soiled hands let him go wash his own.
Secretary of War Tail is emphatically of the opinion
that the Sultan of Jolo is a gambler, an intriguer, a cow
ard and no patriot. What a pity it is we can't trans
plant the Sultan in Venezuela and match # him against
Castro, who has been offensively and suspiciously quiet
for some time. With qualities so eminently fitting him
for participation in South American politics, the Sultan
is wastii:;? activities that in- another environment would
be productive of at least an interesting row.
NATIONAL ROADS.
IF; the* increasing demands on the Federal treasury
are all met, the time when we were a billion-dollar
country will look like a peanut. The proposed addi
tional pension legislation will at once run our annual
pension appropriation up to -two hundred millions. -The
men are not long voters who w.re boys when General
Garfield introduced the, pension appropriation in the
House with an apology because it carried thirty-eight
millions, and said he was able t to assure the country
that that was high-water mark, and the appropriation
would decline from that time on. < Yet in 1903 the pen
sion appropriation was $138,000,000, having gained; \z
hundred millions on Garfield's high-water mark, and now
threatens to' rise $162,000,000 above it.
The newest demand on the Federal Government is for
$24,000,000 to build county roads throughout the coun
try.. No one pretends to Â£?11 why the United States
should build neighborhood , roads. If the people pafd
their road tax in money and it was properly spent, we
would have the best roads in the world. But they waste
the local tax, and now have been induced to ask the Fed
eral Government to do for them what they are entirely
able to do for themselves.
It is interesting that the , leading advocate of this new
raid is the Democratic Senator Latimer of South Caro
lina, who admits^ the constitutional incapacity of the Fed
eral Government, to do it, but declares that the constitu
tion is violated for everything else, and therefore ought
to be for this. If that were, true, \ wise statesmanship
would seem to require that the constitution be respected
iiv all things, and hot' make a pm hole in ' it the excuse
for jumping through it, like a papered hoop at a circus.
Of course there is'a chance to build up a road bureau
at Washington, to. handle- these millions and have a full
staff, from chief to charwoman, but it is plain that if
every bucket is to be filled Uncle SamV cow will not
have enough milk.
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Judicial Dignity.
When Samuel H. Dwinelle presided
over the old Fifteenth District Court
in the early seventies he had occasion
to assert his. dignity in a very forceful
manner one 'day.
A man was being tried for the shoot
ing c-f a second individual in the bar
room of v the old Parker House, famous
in those days as a resort for members
of the legal fraternity. George W. Ty
ler, a brusque, brow-beating attorney,
and Alexander Campbell were the op
posing counsels. One of the disputed
points at issue was the question of the
width of the saloon. One witness Bwore
it was , forty feet wide, while another
declared it to be only twenty-five.
- Suddenly Tyler appealed to Judge
Dwinelle, saying: "Your Honor knows
very well that this witness is commit
ting perjury when he swears the saloon
in question is forty feet wide. You
yourself know as well if not better than
any man in Fan Francisco the depth
and width of the Parker House sa
loon."
"One minute, sir," quickly ordereft
the Judge: "it may be true and it
undoubtedly is true that Samuel H.
Dwinelle, Judge of the Fifteenth Dis
trict Court, has been in the saloon in
question, and sometimes in very doubt
ful company with very disreputable
members of the bar. But. sir. I want
you to understand that this court has
no judicial knowledge either of the
place or of the competency of Samuel
H. Dwlnelle's knowledge concerning it.
"In the future, sir. be careful how
you tamper with the majesty of the
law."
When court adjourned Judge Dwi
ndle leaned his elbows on the Parker
House bar and clicked glasses with
Attorney Tyler.
A Duty Done.
Over in Oakland they have a police
man who believes in the practical ap
plication of the axiom that the "law
ls.no respecter of persons." And the
object of the application was no less
a man than Warren Olney. Mayor
and ex-officio a member of the Board
of Police and Fire Commissioners of
the city of oaks.
Oakland has a municipal ordinance
that requires property owners to keep
sidewalk shade trees >o the foliage
will not obstruct pedestrians. Jusc
new, under Mayor Olney's direction,
the city is being cleaned and beauti
fied along thoroughfares as never be
fore in its history. His Honor is bend
ing every official energy in that di
rection. The Police Department has
been under strict orders toenforc* all
ordinances in bearing upon clean
streets.
The other night Policeman Jack
Gardiner, whose beat Includes "Black
stone Hill," where the Mayor's home
is located, noticed that the luxuriant
growth about the Olney grounds was
out of bounds. So the patrolman
acted. i. V
Meeting the Mayor at his doorway
the policeman saluted and said:
"Mayor Olney, your trees are not
trimmed according to regulation, and
I am compelled to call your attention
to them."
"Well, well. Is that so," responded
the Mayor. "I am obliged to you. It
shall .be done at once."
"By the way, are you a regular po
lice officer of this city?" queried his
Honor.
"Yes, sir," replied Gardiner, a bit
nonplussed.
But as the Mayor extended his hand
and Clasped the other's in hearty
grasp, saying, "I am very glad to
know j-ou, sir," the doubts and fears,
if any he had, disappeared from the
vigilant patrolman's mind.
'A Verified Complaint.
Many queer complaints are received
by the municipal authorities at the
City Hall. Perhaps the queerest was
one received a few days ago by the
Board of Health. It came in the shape
o.f a communication calling the atten
tion of the board to the fact that a cer
tain lodging-house on Third street was
not overcleanly. "Every time I stop
there," said the complainant, "I find
myself the prey of bedbugs."
Inclosed with the communication was
a small envelope, tightly sealed. Writ
ten across the face of this envelope
were these words: "A few samples."
The Storm King.
The day is dying, somber-hued.
Its gloom affrights each tender flower;
But o'er the land yon mountain grand
Stands sentinel, in pride and power.
0 Storm King bold, I trust in thee,
Thou emblem of eternity!
Alone thou art: oh. would my heart
Like thee alone, were strong like thee!
1 saw the sunset redden wild,'
One last despairing smile of fate;
An instant bright in face of night.
It looked serene on love and hate.
O Storm Kingr high, inspire my soul
To such nobility as thine!
'Mid tempest's ire and lightning's fire.
Point thou where shine the stars divine.
â Success.
Like Bears.
Some curious experiments have been
made at one of the royal philanthropic
institutions In Copenhagen. For some
years back the seventy boys and girls
in the place have been carefully
weighed every day in groups of fifteen
,and under.'. Thereby it is proved that
the children gain weight mostly in au
tumn and in the early part of Decem
ber. From that time till the end of
April there is scarcely any increase in
weight. More remarkable still, "there is
a diminution till the end of summer. â
Chicago Tribune.
Eugenie's Jewels.
The story of the Servian jewels must
recall to the former. Empress Eugenie
her own experiences when the waves
first began to dash about her throne.
She determined to sell the greater part
of her jewels, in hope to do something
to save the dynasty, says the St. James
Gazette.
Publicity, had to be avoided, and a
market was not to be found in Europe,
newly thrilled by the horrors of Sedan.
The Empress .lool-ed "to the East for a
market. An Englishman was on his
way home for ' a â¢; holiday. A telegram
at Bombay awaited him from one of
the greatest European financial houses
and informed him of the determination
of the Empress. The difficulty had
been to find a man with sufficient in
fluence to be able to approach the
Princes of India in secret with a view
to selling them Jewels. Not less hard
was it to la.v hands on the man who
had moral strength sufficient to carry
with him surreptitiously hundreds of
thousands of pounds' worth of Jewels
in lands where the Queen's writ did
not run and where the protection of
the constable is not immediately avail
able. :*> '
Every care had been taken to insnr*
secrecy. The Jewels had been taken
to pieces; the gems removed from their
settings; the latter "jointed" to ad
mit of their holding and being worn
around the waist of their bearer in a
belt of soft leather. The Englishman
put on the belt, armed himself with a
trusty revolver, engaged as trusty a
servant, acd set forth on his mission.
For three months he wandered over
road, rail and river. The responsibility
of his trust, the constant danger of dis
covery, the difficulty of disposing of
his burden' were â¢worries that combined
almost to kill him. At last he was
successful. The jewels were sold to
a prince who esteemed them the more
that they were the property of a dis
tressed Empress. There would have
been trouble, no doubt, had ihe matter
been known at the India office, but the
man who discharged the undertaking
afforded an example of courage and a
solid worth in trying conditions which
merit a place in the story of commer
cial integrity and disregard of personal
danger. Far less exciting enterprises
have served to make popular novels
before now.
Another, Flying Dutchman.
A vessel that Is supposed to be the
oldest ship of her kind sailing under
the British flag is described by the St.
James Gazette. It is said that "her
name is the Dart; she was built at Car
narvon seventy-eight years ago, and
ever since has been in constant em
ployment. At one time she sailed be
tween Carnarvon and Liverpool; she is
now engaged in the coasting trade be
tween Arbroath and ports on the north
east coast of England. The Dart ha*
another distinction besides her age. She
is manned by the oldest crew sailing
the high seas. The captain is 70, the
mate 72, the cook 71 and a seaman 61 â
a total of 332. They have been with the
Dart for some years"; and were all boys
together."

The farmer is satisfied if his cereal
crop yields him a profit of $10 or $20
an acre. The horticulturist â and I
mean by this term the man who grows
fruit or vegetables outdoors â must get
from $50 to $5000 per acre; and to
do this he must be able to make use
of every possible fact which science
and practice have shown to be of
value. v

THEATERS MUST
BE MADE SAFE
Playhouse Managers and City
Officials Assemble in Mayor's
Office to Discuss Reports
LAW HAS. BEEN IGNORED
Disposition Is Shown, However,
to Comply With All Sugges
tions tv Protect Human Life
Protection of human M(% in the event
of fire or panic in a theater was the
pubjeet of an exhaustive discussion yes
terday afternoon in the private office of
Mayor Srhmitz. Among those who par
ticipated were the Mayor, Fire Chief
Sullivan, managers of the various play
housfs and members of the Police Com
mission and the Board of Public Work?.
Reports of Chief Sullivan and of the
Police Commission and the Board of
Works on the condition of th<? theaters
had been submitted to the Mayor, and
he called- the meeting for the purpose
of seeing what the managers had done
and were ready to do in the way of
compiling with the ordinance relative
to public safety in theaters.
"These reports show," the Mayor ex
plained to the managers, "that there
haVe been many violations of the law,
but we don't want to take radical ac
tion of any kind until you have had
full and free discussion of the subject.
At the outset, however, I wish to have
It distinctly understood that the or
dinance must be obeyed until such time
as its unjust or impracticable provi
sions can be repealed. Public life in the
theaters must be safeguarded by every
possjble means."
The theaters were then taken up one
by one, and as the Mayor read the al
terations and improvements that had
been suggested the manager of the
house in question stated what he had
done and what he was willing to do in
compliance with the reports.
MOKE WATER NEEDED.
Charles L. Ackerman. who represent
ed the Orpheum, the Tivoli, the Grand
Opera-house, the Alhambra, the Chutes
and the Lyceum, evidently voiced the
sentiments of the other managers in all
his promises and objections. In expla
nation of the inadequate water pressure
in each theater reported by Chief Sul
livan, Mr. Ackerman said that the
blame for that lay with the Spring
Valley Company, which had refused to
supply the pressure dAnanded by the
ordinance. The automatic system of
water pipes on the stage, also pre
scribed by the ordinance, he pronounced
both unnecessary and impracticable, as
the same 'purpose could be accomplished
â¢with more certainty and quickness by
the perforated pipe system, now mostly
used, with a fireman constantly in at
tendance while the public is in the the
ater. Chief Sullivan and Commissioner
Casey said that to insure perfect safety
both those systems should be employed.
Mr. Ackerman said the managers were
as eager as any one else to promote
safety in their respective houses, but
they did object to the automatic sys
tem as both impracticable and pro
hibitive in price. â¢ â¢
The Tivoli was the first theater con
sidered, and Mr. Ackerman said that
every improvement suggested in the re
ports will be complied with at once.
Manager Marks of the Columbia also
expressed desire to do what the mu
nicipality demanded. The Alhambra
management promised to hasten the
completion of thÂ£ alterations recom
mended, as did the manager of the Cal
ifornia.
AS TO THE ALCAZAR
When the condition of the Alcazar
was taken up for discussion the Mayor J
said that as the house is now construct- :
ed and equipped a fire or other cause of \
panic within Its walls during a per- i
formance would be likely to result in I
loss of life, and that its facilities for i
egress must be improved at once. Man- j
ager Mayer said he was ready to make i
any alterations the Board of Works or |
the Poiice Commission might suggest. !
The alterations recommended by the !
reports include more exits, the substi- !
tution of an inclined plane for the j
staircase at the main entrance, the
placing of the aisles on a level with the
parquet floor, the widening of all the
aisles and improvement of the stair
ways from the balcony to the foyer.
Mayor Schmitz said he has some plans
in view which he will explain to Man
ager Mayer later.
The Orpheum is to be supplied with*
better protection from fire, with wider
aisles, with more exits and with aisles
leading directly to them.
Fischer's Theater must also be
equipped with more efficient fire-fight
ing facilities, more exits from the audi
torium, fire escapes from the rear of the
gallery to O'Farrell street, wider aisles
and a wider main entrance.
The manager of the Novelty Theater
said he had already complied with all
the recommendations reported.
SPRING VALLEY AGAIN.
When the Grand Opera-house was
taken up and Mr. Ackerman stated for
the third or fourth time that the in
adequate water pressure complained of
by Chief Sullivan was the fault of the
Spring Valley Water Company the
Mayor declared that the Spring Valley
"Water 'Company must be asked for an
explanation of its conduct in the mat
ter. Among the improvements sug
gested for the Grand Opera-house are
an exit on either side of the auditorium,
higher gallery rails and removal of
the three marble steps in the foyer.
Mr. Ackerman filed vigorous protest
against thqflatter proposition and the
Mayor promised it would be held in
abeyance.
The condition of the Central Theater
was favorably reported on and the
house manager of the Lyceum said that
every alteration suggested in the re
ports on his theater had already been
made. The manager of the Midway
was informed that If he does not Im
mediately make more exits In his the
ater and furnish it with better protec
tion from fire it will be closed and he
laughingly said that as ithe property
lately changed ownership it is likely to
be closed anyway.
The Unique, the Cineograph and the
Marionette theaters were reported on in
a bunch, and the report was to the
effect that their condition is a menace
to the safety of their inmates In the
event of fire or panic, while, their con
struction is so generally defective that
no specific recommendations as to their
Improvement could be made. The
Board of Works suggested that the
three houses be closed If they are not
made safe at once.
The C^iutes completed the list and
the manager said he had done every
thing the reports advised him to do.

ASKS COUNTIES
TO MAKE HASTE
Secretary Willis of World's Fair
Commission Sends Notice to
Arouse Tardy Exhibitors
SPACE IS ALL ADJUSTED
Steps Will Next Be* Taken to
Forward California's Prod
ucts for Show to Exposition
After a herculean struggle in. the
division of space In the agriculture
building at St. Louis between the coun
ties that will make exhibit at the ex
position of tha present year, the Cali
fornia Commissioners have reached a
point where there is only one possible
ground for further discussion concern
ing space allotments.
All the counties have agreed to take
what has been assigned, with the ex
ception of Alameda County. The peo
ple of Alameda were contented to oc
cupy the portion of the ground and
wall room that a diagram showed to
have been set aside for their exhibit.
Recently, however, a map or chart was
received from St. Louis which had lines
on it inclosing a flatiron shaped area
that was apparently taken from Ala
meda. .
Letters have been sent to St. Louis
to inquire what is meant by this. The
Commissioners have no knowledge of
any space being shorn from the Ala
meda area, but the map tells a dif
ferent story. It may be all a mistake.
On the receipt of replies from St. Louis
the fate of Alameda County will be
fixed. If there is no interference with
the space as originally assigned there
will be no reason for any additional
question. All other counties are satis
fied.
Acting on the belief that the space
allotment matter is now practically dis
posed of. Secretary E. B. Willis has
sent out a circular letter 'addressed to
the persons who have charge of the
exhibits that are to be forwarded to
St. Louis at the expense of the com
mission and has requested that they
move promptly to get their wares into
the bands of the commission at an
early date. In part Secretary Willis
writes:
"We besr to request that you will
get your material packed for Shipment
at the earliest possible day and supply
the commission as soon as possible with
a memorandum of the number of pack
ages you will have and list the con
tents tjf the same. It is suggested that,
owing to the very high rate on struc
tural material, the counties and Indi
vidual exhibitors shall arrange to have
their structures built it St. Louis."

DAIRIES MAKE
BIG RETURNS
State Bureau Reports That
Output for Last Season Ex
ceeded $20,000,000 in Value
BEATS THE GOLD MINES
Irrigation Figures as Leading
Factor in Counties Where In
crease Was Largely Effected
The State Dairy Bureau has just com
pleted the compilation of statistics of
the butter and cheese output of Califor
nia during the last year. It is shown
that the increase over the output of the
preceding season was 3,075,213 pounds.
The total output for 1902-03 was 34.676,
311 pounds. That of the preceding sea
son was 31,528.763. The Increase amount
ed to about 10 per cent. Altogether the
dairy output amounted in value to $20,
436,152 for the last season. Secretary
Saylor of the State Dairy Bureau
claims that the dairy interest is the
largest income producer of any single
line of industry in California.
â¢ The butter produced during the last
season was worth $8,669,077. The cheese
sold for $856,996. Condensed milk repre
sented the value of $621,233. The people
of California consumed $6,682,73$ worth
of milk. Calves raised and sold for veal
brought In $1,724,844. and the pork that
was raised on by-products had a value
of $1,881,264.
"These figures," says Secretary Bay
lor, "are based upon a- most conserva
tive basis. The gold mines of Califor
nia have / made ' the State famous
throughout the civilized world, and yet
the value of the product of the dairy
cows of the State for the last year ex
ceeds that of the gold output for 1902 by
more than J3.000.000. The increase in
the output in butter in one year was
more than 60 per cent."
An analysis of the statistics is sup
plied by Secretary Saylor. He says that
it is shown that the increase in the
dairy output is largely confined to cer
tain districts, and Is especially marked
in districts where the people have taken
recently to. dairying on irrigated land.
He says:
The coast counties, excepting Los Angeles
and San Diego, in the extreme southern end
of the State, have just about held their own,
Humboldt County, the largest butter producer
In the State, showing a slight decline. The
Bain is therefore confined almost entirely to
the counties in Southern California, the San
Joaquin and a portion of the Sacramento val
leys. During the season two more counties
crossed the l,00O.*X>-pound mark. They are
Stanislaus and Tulare. making nine in the
State with an annual output of over 1,000,000
pounds. In the case of both these counties the
increase over the previous year amounts to
almost 60 per cent. Kings and Merced coun
ties gaired each approximately 30 per cent and
Fresno 25. " Five counties in the- San Joaquin
valley â Fresno, Kings. Merced, Stanislaus
and Tulare â made a total gain over the pre
vious year of over 1,500,000 pounds, or ap
proximately 40 per cent.
In â¢ the Sacramento Valley there are only
two counties in which dairy development Is as
yet conspicuous. These are Sacramento and
l'olo. The former gained a little over 10 per
cent and the latter 15.
While there has been a gain of about 10 per
cent in the total output of butter Jn Califor
nia, the increase must be credited to about
a dozen counties located In the irrlarated, al
falfa growing sections of the State. The hilly
roast and intermountaln counties are barely
keeping up with former years.
John Redmond, in his reply to the
speech from the throne, said yesterday

until they had home rule. If more ladies
would act on' this principle few kitchens

HYMNS SUBJECT
OF DISCUSSION
Presbyterians Do Not Regard
With Favor Gospel Songs and
Indorse Onlv Standard Music
CHOIR "3IUST BE SELECT
Professor Buck Is Outspoken
Before Theological Seminary
Conference and Wins Support
Music and poetry, true rhythm and
perfect harmony, were among the ( im
portant subjects discussed at the second
day of the conference of the alumnt of
the San Francisco Theological Seminary
yesterday at San Anselmo. .
The gospel hymn and the standard
hymn were considered, and critics were
numerous and profound and in accord
as to the quality, the tone and standard
of the hymns that should be sung in
the Presbyterian church.
The general opinion was that the
church should be careful of the stand
ard of church music and the poetry to
which the music Is set. The recom
mendation arrived at was that the Pre3- J
byterlan church use the hymnal pre
pared by the denominational commit
tee and reject that class of hymns cal
culated to appeal more to the emotion
than the understanding.
The discussion was aroused through
Professor Charles G. Buck, who spoke
on "A Study of Hymnology," In part
saying:
Is the Presbyterian church making use of
{rood hymns and good music in its public ser
vice?
A hymn should be reverent and dignified in
rhythm and also in its poetic treatment. If
the solemnity of the worship of God is relaxed,
if the minister makes it a point to be free and
easy and undignified, sometimes even in
prayer, and the hymns are chosen with a view
to awaken a sentimental emotion or to tickle
the ears of the congregation, you will get peo
ple into the church, but they will drift away
more easily, for the foundation of love is taken
away from them.
HYMNS MUST BE DIGNIFIED.
A feeling of revolt against authority has al
ways led the masses to welcome any tendency
to a .relaxation of the dignity of the service of
woi>nip, and I am inclined to believe that re
laxation is usually shown first in the music.
It has been the case in all religious denomina
tions.
There is" a certain atmosphere of dignity
about the worship of God that should be pre
served In the hymns and in the service. His
word is written in a stately language of its
own, which should give the keynote to the
whole service.
The same characteristics should distinguish
the music to which hymns are set. It should
be reverent and dignified. It may. be strong
or graceful, ioyous or sad. as the sentiment
shall demand, ' but it should be worthy of the
subject. In referring to the gospel hymns
which came into mich prominence In the time
of Mr. Moody's great work, let us see If the
gospel hymns are reverent, poetic or dignified
in words onil music.
I don't know that I can call them irreverent.
Are these hymns poetic? Have they inter
pretative power that Is, as Mathew Arnold
says, the power of so dealing with things as
to awaken in us a wonderfully full, new and
intimate eense of them and of our relations
with them?
BALD UXPOETIC RHYMES.
I am willing- to admit the claim that hymns
have been a. means of salvation and comfort
to many who were hearing these things for
the flrst time, but I cannot understand any
one persisting- in the use of these bald, un
poetlc. commonplace rhymes after he haa
once heard -the work of poets and musicians.
Why, when we have the standard hymns,
should any one Â»lng gospel hymns? They are
the work of people without inspiration. I be
lieve that the sun of the eo*pel hymn as a
"part of the church service has set. A proof
of it is thÂ£ welcome given to our beautiful
new hymnal, which eeems to me a collec
tion worthy to be the permanent *hook of praise
for the Presbytertan church. ' "
Surely, if Episcopalian children can learn
(rood ml beautiful hymns Presbyterian chil
dren can. â¢ \
The Rev. Frederick A. Doane 4ed the
discussion on the subject. Dr. John S.
Macintosh, agreeing with all Professor
Buck said, was followed by Dr. Cros
by, who condemned sentimental and
operatic singing in church. After the
Rev. A. K. Magary. the Rev. Dr. Mills,
the Rev. Mr. Rich and Professor Thom
as F. Day, D. D., had spoken in favor
of standard hymns Professor Buck re
plied and laid particular stress upon the
necessity of having Christians in the
choir and of having, the right kind of
leader, in sympathy with the church,
who would not tolerate a soloist who
merely sang "to show himself or her
self oft."
Professor Buck considered that the
leader or director of a choir must be
autocratic and one able to choose ac
cording to general temperament and
character, and keep out of the choirs
the kind of people they did not want.
Other, discussions of the day and
evening were "The Province of Chris
tian Dogmatics," by the Rev. James
freorge Anderson; "The Bible as Liter
ature." by the Rev. George G. Eldredge.
and "The Meaning of the Cross," by the
Rev. Mr. Strong.
This afternoon Dr. John S. Macintosh
will be Inaugurated as president of the
seminary and installed as professor of
systematic theology.

YOUNG CORBETT SIGNS TO FIGHT SULLIVAN THIS MONTH
YOSEMITE CLUB
SECURES MATCH
Negotiations Arc # Conducted'
Quietly and Announcement
Has Created Some Surprise
BRITT FIGHT AFJECTED
The Californian Says He Will
Not Meet the Featherweight
â¢ If This Event Goes Through
Toung Corbett and Dave Sullivan
were matched by tfce Yosemite Club
yesterday to fight twenty rounds on
the last day of this monfh in Mechan
ics' Pavilion. The men have agreed to
weigh 130 pounds at 6 o'clock on the
day of the fight.
The announcement of this match had
much the same effect on the people
interested in the Corbett-Brltt fight as
would the explosion of a bomb in their
midst. Britfs attitude is summarized
in his words: "If that fight Is on. my
fight with Young Corbett is off."
The Hayes Valley Club officials take
the same viewpoint and announce that
they will nc/t promote the fight if Cor
bett persists in keeping this engage
ment. What complicates the case is
the fact that Referee Eddie Graney
holds a $2500 forfeit from Britt and
another from the club, the former guar
anteeing the boxer's appearance in the
ring: and the latter guaranteeing the
ability of the club to promote the con
tesL
Britt said last night: "Young Cor
belt takes the chance of injuring his
hands or even of being defeated, either
of which would kill all Interest in o-ur
fight. The club managers also intended
to boom our fieht. but with this one
scheduled they could do nothing until
it had been decided. It means hard
work for me to make the weight at
which we are to fleht and I do not
vant to dÂ» a month's work for noth
ing. While there is no clause in the
Rilffles binding Young Corbett not to
fight, he gave me his word that he
would not do so."
"Corbett has only followed out his
usual custom in this matter." said
Manager Coffroth of the Yosemite Club
last night. "Fighting is his business
and he tries to keep going all the time.
When he si.?nf-d for Hanlon a year ago
he went and fought Maynard on his
way out here. From the day "he signed
r:tth Britt he has been endeavoring to
Â£<?t on another match. His ooint of
vfewls simply this â he says the owner
of a race horse which is entered in
rich events starts his horse in cheaper
races when he sees a chance of winning
some easy money and of giving him a
good workout."
Sullivan was in Boston yesterday and
at once started for New York, en route
tj this.olty. He has never fought Cor
bett. but has met McGovern, Broad and
the other featherweights.
The making of this match again puts
off Frankie Neil's first appearance here
since he won the championship. A
match had nearly been arranged be
tween himself and Abe Attel. When
this fell through a match was sug
gested between Nell and Monte Attel
Â«t US pounds. The pair may meet In
the south.

OARSMEN PLAN
SPRING RACES
University Mon Expect a Match
With Northern College Crews
Early in. the Present Season
SUGGEST ESTUARY .CQUKSE
As They Went North Last Year
and Were Beaten .They Want
a Trial in Home Waters
BERKELEY. Feb. 3.â If the plans
go through as expected, the rowing
crews Of the University erf California
and of the University of Washington
will meet on the water some time dur
ing the spring. The boating associa
tion of the university has already sent
a challenge to Washington^ fon a re
gatta in April, and a reply is awaited
from the north with some anxiety. The
challenge Is the result of a lot of cor
respondence carried on between the
rowing men of the two universities, the
discussion being over terms and place.
California went north and met defeat
at the hands of the Washingtorrtans
last summer, and now California wants
to have the matches decided here Just
to see if it cannot even up matters. It
Is likely to prevail, as all the convinc
ing argument seems to be on its side,
particularly when there is such an ideal
place as Oakland estuary to point ta
as a good rowing: course.
There is a chance, too, that Stanford
will figure in the rowing game this
year. Urged by the California rowers,
Stanford has been gradually working
up to the point of negotiating for boats,
and it is understood one Is now build
ing for the Palo Alto Institution in the
East. With California, Washington
and Stanford supporting rowing crews,
it seems possible there will be three
cornered intercollegiate matches every
year.
In anticipation that there may be a
match with Stanford freshmen this
year, the California freshmen are do
ing a lot of work these days with the
Indoc-r rowing machine and on the
track, the exercises being intended to
develop the wind and the muscles of
the men. A. S. Bunnell, '04, has charge
of the freshmen and every day he* puts
them through a course of exercise,
pupils are H. W. Schrieber, H. M. Hall.

Bojs Do Their- Share tÂ« Raise Funds
for Xew Clubhouse at
- Vallejo.
The entertainment by the boys from
the training station at Goat Island for
the benefit of the naval clubhouse at
Vallejo last night was a success, so
cially, artistically and financially. The
boys who have' been trained to walk
the decks of a ship trod the boards as
though acting, not fighting, were their
specialty in life. The entertainment
opened with an overture by the United
States naval band, followed by a drill
of apprentices. The one-act sketch
"Stranded on Goat Island" was next
produced. The various parts in the cast
were filled by the following sailor men:
W. H: J. Dallaghan, bugler; T. R.
Spear, boatswain's mate; F. Nief, ap
prentice: C. O. Davis, chief yeoman; J.
McDonald, landsman for training; 11.
Hendrollet. landsman for training, and
M. P. Casey, chief boatswain's mate.
This was followed by a song by E. G.
Dickerson and some clever head .bal
ancing by G. Brown, after which the
sketch "Lights and Shadows of a Po
lice Court" was enacted, the partici
pants being: S. Smith, cockswain; J.
Cline, J. Simmons, Bill Bailey; C. O.
Davis, chief yeoman; N. Clark, G.
Brown; J. S. Parker, â¢ landsman for
training; C. Constantine, ship's cook;
A, Mongula and F. L. Heiser. ,
The sketch "The Boxing Instructor's

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 4, 19Q4.
GOLD MONEY AT SCANT ODDS
WINS IN A COMMON GALLOP
Rollick Drops In
First* at Odds
of 15 to 1.
A well-balanced card drew/ a large
attendance to Ingleslde track yester
day and the talent had only themselves
to blame If the bookies were not.worst
ed. Backed! horses with one exception
ran closely to form, three favorites, two
second choices and an outsider annex
ing purses. Pleasant weather and a
fast track left nothing .to wish for.
On the strength of his race the pre
ceding day Mr. Dingle looked almost
an absolute certainty for the opening
seven furlong run. He was backed
down to C to 5, and, well handled by
Larsen. passed Little Sister in the
stretch, winning cleverly from lsabel
lita. The latter mare was bet on and
If awav tyetter might have won. Lou
Clieveden ran . a fair- race, finishing
fourth behind Little Sister.
But four started in the mile run for
mares and" geldings, and it turned out
to be uuite a spirited betting affair.
Esherin was played from 10 to 4%.
Major Tenny had many friends, but as
the big bettors stayed with Daisy
Green, ridden by Hildebrand. the East
ern mare closed favorite over Grafter.
GUAITER WINS EASILY.
Daisy and Esherin cut out the run
ning for six and a half furlongs, when
both had played out their string. Tom
my Burns slipped through on the rail
with Major Tenny and for a second
looked dangerous, but Jack Martin
astride Grafter had too much in re
serve, winning almost easily by less
than a length. The favorite lost the
show to Esherin by/ a head.
At odds of 1 to 2, Walter Jennings'
crack mare Gold Money won the Fu
turity course sprint, next to be decided,
just as she pleased. Jack Martin, of
course, had the mount, and had the
course, had the mount, and had the fa
vorite up in his lap behindMoneyMusa
to the stretch. Although the latter
sprinter was tiring, Hagerdon could not
overhaul him, finishing in the show.
Bookmaker Frank Lanterman'e
Stuyve enjoyed quite as easy a. vic
tory in the mile selling run. The brown
gelding, with Hildebrand up, was
quoted a 9 to 10 chance at post time
and simply galloped out In front from
start to finish. Somenos, the runner
up for three-quarters of the route, ijed
away, and Hainault ran second, four
lengths before Illilouon. Scotsman by
his poor showing displayed the fact
that he possesses little class. .
AX A OUTSIDER LAXDS.
Milt Jones* Rollick, with Johnny Daly
on his back, stopped the progress of
the favorites by capturing the- fifth
race at odds of 15 to 1. Daly moved
his mount into the leading position
after Muresca and Yellowstone had
tired and passed the wire four open
lengths before Bard Burns. Judge Voor
hies, a well backed outsider piloted by
Tommy Burns, led the favorite Matt
Hogan out for the show.
As there was some doubt about Mar
tinmas going one and a sixteenth miles,
Charley Heilshall got 3 to 1 for some of
Tils money in the betting on the last
race. The regulars stayed with Ni
greUe, making the little black mare fa
vorite at 8 to 5. Kunz took Martinmas
out in front at the start, and stalling
off the challenge of Oliphant on the fa
vorite in the stretch earned the decision
by half a length". His Eminence finished
third, five lengths behind Nigrette.
After an early exhibition of speed Nam
tor died away to nothing.
NOTES OP THE TRACK.
Jack Martin piloted two winners.
Hiram Pierce and H. Magill after an
argument came to blows down in the
paddock. The matter was reported to
the judges.
Isabellita experienced little difficulty
beating Carilee In the opening event
yesterday. The mare improved consid
erably over night and was bet on by
some smart ones.
Dr. Long, an outsider starting in the
third race, was well played for the
show. The company was too rich for
the Doctor.
i The flags at Ingleside hung at half
mast yesterday out of respect to the
memory of William C Whitney.
Harry Birkenruth, who has been rid
ing at Los Angeles, was at the track
yesterday. He is on his way back to
"Chicago.
Twenty-four books cut in. The Mel
bourne Club was the absentee.
Foley will ride Joe Lesser in the big
race on Saturday.

MAKES A PESPERATE
EFFORT TO ESCAPE
James Bailey Breaks Away From a
Policeman and Risks Life in
James Bailey, known to the police
as a morphine fiend and suspected of
having committed various acts of
petty larceny, made a desperate at
tempt to escape from the custody of
the police yesterday morning. Bailey
was arrested by Officer Connolly on
Kearny street, but while en route to
the Hall of Justice made a bold dash
*or freedom.
The desperate man first ran into a
lodging-house at the corner of Mer
chant street and Dunbar alley, 'from
which he traversed a narrow ledge on
the addition from the Morgue build
ing to the Hall of Justice. From the
ledge he leaped head foremost
through a window into the Morgue
building, carrying the sash with
him. Messenger James Murphy cor
nered the man and after a few blows
had been exchanged turned him over
to the waiting officers. Bailey was
not Injured by his leap through the
window.
Body Found In the Bay.
The body of Francis Charlin, a
sailor, was found floating off Washing
ton-street wharf yesterday afternoon
by D. L. O'Brien and Frank Beggs.
two employes of the McNeil Launch
Company. Deceased had been em
ployed on the French ship Vercinge
torix as engineer of the donkey engine.
About twelve days ago he was paid off
and was subsequently seen drunk
along the water front.- From the con
dition of the body it is the opinion of
Autopsy Surgeon Bacigaltffrl that the
body had been in the water about ten
days. An examination of the remains
gives no evidence of foul play.
It is generally the hot-headed poker
player who first displays symptoms of
cold feet.

IS OBSTRUCTION
Works Board Members Say Gift
of Lotta Impedes Traffic and
Musi Be, Eemoved in Time
The Board of Works yesterday direct
ed die City Engineer to prepare plans
for a pubitc safety station at the cor
ner of Powell and Market streets. The
station is to be similar to the one at
Market and Kearny streets.
Commissioner Woodward desired to
know if the latter station did not-inter
fere with on the thoroughfare.
Commissioner Ca*ey replied that traffic
â was seriously impeded at the point
â¢where it stood on account of the prox
imity of Lotta's fountain.
"The fountain is very much in the
â¢way," paid Casey, "and it is only a
question of time when It must be re
moved from its present location. Of
course the proposed new station at
Powell street will have more surround
ing space and teaming will httve more
room* than at Kearny street."
The board also expressed itself In
favor of placing the proposed new con
venience elation underneath the safety
station at Powell sfreet. The City En
gineer is now preparing plans for the
convenience station.
The board approved the map of the
district to be assessed for grade
changes on Fourteenth street, between
Castro and Alpine.
The San Francisco Construction Com
pany was granted a permit to construct
a sewer on Frederick street, between
First avenue and Willard street;
Grades were ordered changed on San
rhez and Thirtieth and Green and Fill
more streets.
On account of ill health Building In
spector M. A. Clark resigned and hi3
refcisnation was accepted.
The board ordered the construction of
an artificial stone sidewalk on Green
Ftreet. ne*r Webster, the owner having
failed, after due notice, to replace a
dangerous wooden sidewalk in front of
his premises at 20C0 Green street.
The board decided to order the con
struction of sidewalks nine feet In
width on Point Lobos avenue from Wil
liamson to Flirt avenue.
The receipts of the Bureau of En
gineering for January were reported to
be $791 for lot surveys and $948 50 for
street work surveys, a total of $1739 .'Â»0.
The expenses, not including the salary
vl the City Engineer, were $4444 03.
Chief Clerk Orrett Resigns.
Edwin Orrctt. for many years chief
Oerk of the purchases and supplies
department of the Southern Pacific
Company, has tendered his resignation
to Manager Stevenson to take effect
on February 15. It is announced that
b*Â» haa retired to accept a position
with R. P. Behwerin. who recently re
tired from the Southern Pacific Com
pany to take full charge of the Har
riman steamship interests. Manager

GIVES DINNER
AT A CLUB TO
HIS FIANCEE
By Sally Sharp.
Under fruit laden branches of orange
genial Jack Wilson gave a dinner at
the Bohemian Club last night, honoring
his fiancee, Miss Cluff, with the final
festivity before their nuptials on the
10th inst.
An amber glow spread from yellow
shades, toning exquisitely with the
golden fruit and its symbolic blossoms.
And, whether by accident or design,
the bride-to-be was gowned in a regal
yellow chiffon robe, spangled with gold.
It was distinctly a yellow dinner, and
one of note as a function of perfect de
tail. Goodfellowship â that which far
outshines the arts of the chef or cellar
manâdistinguished the affair from" all
too many of Its fellows.
The bridal party, consisting of Miss
de Young:, Miss Constance de Young,
Miss Pearl Landers and Miss California
Cluff, were conspicuously honored
guests.
This gay. feast brought to a finis a
round of entertainment in honor of the
fair bride-to-be. The week that re
mains before the wedding will be ab
sorbed religiously by the gownmaker
and the rest of the trousseau tribeâ
with a few hours of restâ the rarest
thing to-day in the possession of a
prospective bride â wedged in between.
A notable wedding was celebrated
yesterday at 3 o'clock, when Mis3
Louise Harrington, daughter of Mrs.
W. P. Harrington, became the bride of
Lieutenant William D. Leahy.
Owing to a recent bereavement the
tfffair was celebrated in the . quietest
manner possible, the bride being at
tended solely by Miss Marie Louise
Harrington, a tiny niece; Lieutenant
Hanrahan, U. S. N., serving the groom
as best man.
The bride, a Junoesque girl of fine
style, never appeared more lovely than
in her nuptial robe of white Chantifly
over ivory silk.
It is a matter of regret that Mrs.
I^eahy must be lost to local society, but
such is the chosen lot of the naval
brides. As Mr. Leahy is attached to
the Tacoma its destination will decide,
their future abiding place.
The marriage of Miss Mabel I. Gunn
and Louis M. Dillman of Chicago last
night was a surprise to the many
friends of. the bride.
. Miss Gunn, who is the daughter of
Amos F. Gunn, is a native of this State
and has spent all her life here. The
groom is manager of the Chicago
branch of the American Book Publish
ing Company and is well known in
business, social and club circles in that
city. He is a graduate of Ohio Uni
versity. During his periodical visits
I here he met Miss Gunn and fell in lave
with her at sight. The engagement
! has only been of short standing; al
, though the interested parties have been
j acquainted for some time.
The marriage was solemnized ' last
night in the apartments of the bride's
j father at the St. Nicholas Hotel. The
â¢ rooms were magnificently decorated in
honor of the occasion. A great pro
! fusion of beautiful white roses filled
every available space, while in the bay
window was suspended a large um
; brella wrought of white crown lilies
â  and tiny electric lights.
The . marriage service was read by
Bishop Nichols. At the conclusion
: of the ceremony an elaborate
wedding supper was served in adjoin
i ing apartment^. The bride was a pic
| ture of exquisite loveliness in a beau
â  tiful wedding robe of white crepe de
chine over silk and chiffon, the waist
trimmed wJth point applique. Her coif
fure was dressed high and from it de
pended the wedding veil and wreath
of orange blossoms that had been worn
by her mother on her wedding day
thirty years ago. Her corsage was
decked *with two magnificent pendants
i of rare pearls and diamonds, the gift
[ of the groom.
Mrs. Gunn looked very handsome in
a rich gown of pale gray crepe, with
point lace.
Only the relatives of the family were
present.
Mrs. Dillman will be greatly missed
i in this city, where she enjoys a large
; and devoted circle of friends and ac-
I quaintances.
Mr. and Mrs. Dillman will leave at
i 10 o'clock this morning for an extended
visit to Eastern and Southern cities,
and will then return to Chicago, where
they will reside permanently.
Miss Ardella Mills and Miss Eliza
beth were hostesses at a very pleasant
card party yesterday in their apart
ments at the Cecil. Fourteen friends
were entertained with the well-known
charm of the Misses Mills. The clever
ness of the young ladies at entertaining
is another unquestionable evidence of
heredity. .
Quite the most attractive luncheon of
the week was given yesterday by Miss
Jane Wilshire in honor of Miss Con
stance de Young. It was indeed an af
fair of "hearts," great red hearts and
red blossoms making the decoration.
But quite the prettiest decoration in
the room was the group of maidens
around the table, who were Miss Con
stance de Young, Miss Mabyl Cluff,
Miss Frances Harris, Miss Ruth Fos
ter. Miss Gertrude Van Wyck, Miss
Clara Carpenter, Miss.Gertrude Jolliffe,

TRUSTS NOT DANGEROUS
SAYS DR. ALBERT SHAW
Editor of Review of Reviews Discusses Capital
Combines,* the Tariff and Need of Reciprocal
Relations With Canada and' Philippine Group
EDITOR OF THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS, WHO ARRIVED IN THIS
CITY YESTERDAY. HE WILL LECTURE THIS EVENING AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ON "MORALS OF TRADE."
Dr. Albert Shaw, editor of the Ameri
can Monthly Review of Reviews, and
regarded as one of the most careful
students of political science and eco
nomics in this country, arrived in this
city yesterday and is registered. at the
Palace Hotel. Dr. Shaw's coming to
San Francisco at this particular date
is primarily due to an engagement to
lecture before the student body of the
University of California to-night. He
will discuss "The Morals of Trade."
a subject provided for under the Henry
Weinstock benefice* Dr. Shaw said yes
terday:-
The subject gives ample latitude and I will
take advantage of the fact. I am satisfied that
Mr. Weinttock had in view, when he selected
this subject, a broad contemplation of wha:
it was expected to cover. I expect to dwell
considerably on the present business methods
and conditions of the day. We have all no
doubt realized that a business la no longer re
garded in the light of a private matter, but
more as a public affair, where the individual
aim is to accomplish something that Is In the
end a benefit shared by the entire community.
A business duty has developed to a point sim
ilar to that of a -newspaper, which Is a pri
vate tnterprlse. yet working in the interest of
all. It 1* like a. surgeon's practice or the
traffic operations of our great railroads.
Dr. Shaw referred to the high order
of intelligence that has asserted itself
to a remarkably extent in the world's
great business affairs of the last few
years, and gradually his remarks cen
tered upon the existence of the trusts
and their effects on the conditions of
mankind. Asked if he thought the
trust tended to minimize the oppor
tunities of young men in business pur
suits, he replied that it was his opinion
that while these great c/ombinations
may change the careers of many young
men they will eventually right them
selves in the new conditions and pro
ceed with the same success or failure
that might have attended their efforts
under the old condition of affairs. In
have issued cards for luncheons on the
9th and the 11th at their beautiful new
home.
On Tuesday Mr. and Mrs. John D.
Spreckels will entertain at a large din
ner.
Mr. and Mrs. E. H. McCracken of
Portland, Or., are at the Palace. They
are en route from New York, where
they have been spending the. winter.
Last night a pretty wedding occurred
at St. Mary's, when Miss Madaline B.
Leahy became the bride of Judge John
J. Van Nostrand. An informal recep
tion was held at the California Hotel,
after whJch the young people departed
for the south for a two weeks' nuptial
trip.
Mrs. J. Parker Currier will entertain
about sixty guests at luncheon to-day

other words, Dr. Shaw expressed him
self most charitably toward the trusts,
a few of which, he admitted, had men
aced industrial and commercial pro
gress, but he argued. that the majority
had been of benefit. He continued:
If you wjll look backward a little you will
recall a number of so-called trusts that . were
really of a menacing character, but being
b-ueh they goon disappeared from the Indus
trial field. The majority of the trusts exist
ing to-day, and especially the greatest of these
combinations of Invested capital. In my opinion
have wrought no harm to' the communities.
They have not advanced the price. of commo
dities consumed. : but. have Increased the con
sumption cf products and In no way Injured
the common purchaser. Those who have suf
fered mainly. If any suffering has been the
case In the organization of these big con
cerns, are those who Invested their capital in
them. Of course, a few have lost their sav
ings.- but most of. the losses can be easily
traced . to the wealthier classes, which
contributed - the capital for the ex
perimental undertakings. Many of the accu
sations that have been hurled at the heads of
trusts of late might more Justly have been
modified to charges of mistakes. These rich
men undertook many things that have since
proved mUtakes and no one realizes that they
were mistaken more than those who were per
haps responslhle for them. But all these dif
ficulties will finally adjust themselves.
HONOR AND ITS USES.
Dr. Shaw classifies the trust as a
high order of commercial enterprise and
looks to its development Into a per
manent and perfect method of modern
business. In all undertakings of a com
mercial character he concedes that
business honor figures prominently, and
in dwelling on this fact he remarked:
Honor, of course, belongs to the man and
his success In life depneds on how he will use
it. If he has the instinct of the rogue It will
poon show Itself. The trust is ostensibly for
the promotion of honest business Intersourse,
and in my Judgment It greatly eliminates
much of the old-time cutthroat method of
carrying on business enterprises by maintain
ing a schedule of prices and providing vast
numbers of the toilers with employment" and
broader avenues for the marketing of prod
ucts.
Although unwilling to enter into a
general discussion of the political pos
sibilities of the coming national cam
paign or to suggest the probable Presi
dential candidates to be chosen at the
party conventions, Dr. Shaw did vol
unteer the prediction that the trusts
would not cut much of a figure in the
deliberations of the two great parties,
and sa!d:
Of course, much may depend on who Is nomi
nated, but when it is remembered that Wall
street is Interested In both tickets, It becomes
doubtful if the trusts will be made a great is
sue of the campaign. There are men there of
both parties . and they are busily engaged in
making tickets, and, if I am not mistaken, they
are nt present very busy with the making of
the Democratic ticket*. They realize that the
Interests of the country cannot be Jeopardised
by attacks on Industrial concerns.
Taking up the often suggested propo
sition, that the existing high tariff of
the country was materially responsible
for the development of the trust farm
of business, the gentleman replied that
he did not coincide with those who have
made this claim, and added:
The heads of the trusts have the mgclves
told you that they were not greatly concerned
over the tariff. They control the more Impor
tant products of the country and if the tariff
on similar commodities from abroad were re
duced they figure that they would not suffer
to any great extent.
Dr. Shaw expects to remain in this
city for several days and will then
journey to Southern California for a
litle rest, of which he is much in need.

LOVED MOTHER
LAID TO REST
Last Sad Rites Over Body of
Mary, de Sales Bouse in the
Chapel at Magdalen ' Asylum
ELOQUENT TRIBUTE TAW
Father Casey Tells of the
Life of Heroic Self-Sacrifice
and Devotion Led by Deceased
v
The body of Mother Mary de Sales
Bouse, who for several years had been
Buperior at the Magdalen Asylum, was
laid to rest in Holy Cross Cemetery
yesterday morning. The funeral ser
vices were held in the chapel at the
Magdalen Asylum, where a solemn
requiem high mass was celebrated by
Father P. S. Casey, assisted by Fath
ers Lyons, Scanlon, Nugent. Demar
slni, S. J.; Mackey. Smith and Lande.
Father Casey preached an eloquent
sermon, in which he paid a fitting tri
bute to the noble woman who had
given up her entire life to work for
others and make their lot in life easier.
He dwelt particularly with the services
she had rendered at the Magdalen Asy
lum, where, he said, she had ever been a
true mother to all penitents, and all
will miss her.
For more than a quarter of a cen
tury Mother de Sales had labored in
California. She was educated by the
Sisters of Mercy at Kinsale, Ireland,
being a pupil of Mother Russell, who
afterward founded the order of Sisters
of Mercy in this country. Deceased
was received into the order in this
country by Mother Russell in 1S57, and
was sent to a branch house at Sacra
mento. As a teacher there she was
noted tf or her zeal and cleverness. After
leaving Sacramento she also taught at
Our Lady of Mercy and St. Peter's
schools in this city. After leaving St.
Peter's she was assigned to the Mag
dalen Asylum, where her self-sacrific
ing devotion to her labors and earliest
sympathy with those in misfortune
â¢won the hearts of all.
For the last three years she had
been afflicted with heart trouble, and,
as predicted by the doctors, death
came suddenly. Sunday morning she
began her duties as usual at 5 o'clock,
and appeared to be in better health
than usual. In the evening she had a
sudden attack of heart failure, from
which she never recovered. The funeral
was largely attended, members of the
order coming from Sacramento and
other places to be present at the cere
mony.
Madden Denies Statement.
The published statement that I in
vited to my house Hector A. Robichon.
the man named as corespondent in my
son's suit for divorce, is unqualifiedly
false. I have not seen the man since
August 1, 1903. when he called at my
house, uninvited, to see my wife con
cerning my daughter-in-law, Mrs. Edith
Partello Madden. Neither since Rob
ichon's dismissal from the army for con
duct unbecoming an officer and a gentle
man, nor before that event, have I in
vited him to visit my house. Whoever
says to the contrary says what is ab
solutely falne.
I do not know the purpose of this
malignant attack upon me unless it be
part of a campaign of vindlctiveness
against me because I have dared to
stand with my son. now absent from
home in the service of his country, in
the legal effort he is making to protect
his honor and the honor of his family.

Trial of a Big Mining Case
Begins in the U. S. Circuit
Court With Army of Talent
IMMENSE PROFITS ' SHOWN
Judge Morrow and a Jury in the
United States Circuit Court yesterday
were occupied with the trial of the case
of the Utah-Nevada Company, an Iowa
corporation, vs. Joseph R. de Lamar
of New York City to recover a per
centage of the gold taken from certain
mines. The Jury was excused from
attending to-day, in order that the at
torneys may argue as to the manner
in which the evidence shall be pre
sented.
A formidable array of attorneys was
present. Representing the complainant
were Houx & Barrett, George E. Bates,
James G. Magulre, W. H. Metson and
Hiram Johnson. The defendant was
represented by Pillsbury, Madison &
Sutro and Lindley & Eickhoff.
The complainant asks for damages
In the sum of $5,260,500, together with
interest, that sum being the amount
alleged to be due as 49 per cent of the
net profits and dividends of the mines
named.
The complaint sets forth the history
of the case as follows:
On January 23, 1894, D. A. Reeves, Frank
Wilson, A. W. Ellis and W. C. Parian, own
ers of the Monitor, Monitor No. 2. the Mon
itor Dump, the Princess, the segregated west
half of the Cliff, an undivided three-quarters
of the Millionaire and an undivided seven
eighths of ihe Lucky Bar mining claims in
Ferguson mining district. Lincoln County. Ne
vada, agreed to sell the same to Samuel T.
Godbe of Utah for $158,033 33, cash, within
thirty days, or on the payment of 5200,000, of
whicil $40,000 was to be paid within thirty
days, and the remainder in three equal pay
ments in six, eight and ten months. The agree
ment required Godbe to pipe water into the
property and to erect a quartz mill of forty
stamps, to cost not less than $SO.OCO nor
more than $80,000, and to operate the mines
In an economical manner. It was stipulated
that should default be made in any of the
payments Godbe shouUL. forfeit Immediately to
the owners all payments previously made, to
g-ether with an undivided half Interest In the
water and milling property and all the Im
provements made by him.
TIME IS EXTENDED.
On March 10. 1894. the time set for making
there payments was extended for oixty days
for tht consideration of $5000 paid by Godbe.
On January 27. 1834, James Xcsbitt, George
NeEbitt. Mrs. Julia McFaddcn and H. A.
Cchen, owners of the Jim Crow mines, ad
joining, made an agreement to sell that prop
erty to Godbe for $150,600, under similar con
liMcns to those prescribed for the sale of the
Monitor claims. Immediately after securing
these agreements Godbe went to New -York
and sold his options to Isaac E. Blake. Blake
on Apt 11 1, 1S94, made an agreement with
De Lamar by which the mines were to be
taken and worked by De Larr.af, he to re
ceive 51 per cent of the stock and dlvldenda
and Blake to receive 49 per cent of the net
profits.
While these things were going on a dis
agreement arose between the sellers concern
ing the exact location of the apex of the lode
or vein in the Jim Crow and Monitor Dump
mines, and by reason of this controversy and
threatened litigation Blake and De Lamar, on
April 22. 1594, obtained the conveyance to De
Lamar of the legal title of the Monitor prop
erties for $80,000 and of the Jim Crow prop
erty for $50,000. De Lamar taking possession
of the mines and continuing to work them. In
the latter part of the year 1894. or the first
part of 1895. De Lamar incorporated De La
mar's Nevada Gold Mining Company and
transferred these mines to that company.
RECEIPTS ARE LARGE.
It is alleged that De Lamar has re
ceived from the profits and dividends
on the stock and the moneys advanced
by him in operating and improving the
properties a large amount of money,
and that he has himself stated that
he has taken from the mines 513,000,000,
of which aj^out 410,000,000 is net prof
its. It is further alleged that he has
not turned over to Blakeor the com
plainant the 49 per cent of the profits,
excepting 57363 44, and that the com
plainant has been therefore damaged
in the sum of 55,260,500, together with
interest. Blake has assigned his in
terest to the 'Utah-Nevada Alining
Company.
Isaac E. Blake occupied the witness
stand in the afternoon and testified to
an oral agreement between himself and
De Lamar at the latter's residence ix\
New York. During the discussion on
the objections to this testimony the
court adiourned.

GRAVE FEARS EXPERIENCED
FOR OVERDUE BARK THEODOR
FOUR-MASTED GERMAN BARK OPTIMA. WHICH HAS JUST BROKEN THE RECORD BY A "WIDE MARGIN
FOR SAILING VESSELS BETWEEN THIS PORT"AND NEWCASTLE, AUSTRALIA, A VOYAGE SHE
COMPLETED IN THIRTY-SEVEN DAYS. , '
The Norwegian bark Theodor was
quoted yesterday for reinsurance at 10
per cent and, although the rate is low,
grave fears are expressed for the ves
sel's safety. The Theodor left Rot
terdam April 9 of last year for this
port. She was next heard from Au
gust 11, when she put into Montevideo
very much the worse for wear. Bat
tered in a heavy gale, she had lost
spars and sails and sustained other
serious damage. She left Montevideo
September 21, after undergoing tempor
ary repairs. She is now out 136 days,
considerably longer than should have
been necessary to bring her to .San
Francisco. '
The St. Mirren's rata remains at 30
per cent, but a substantial advance is
looted for unless the coal laden lime
juicer shows up. The Martaban is
quoted at 90 per cent.
Kosmos Liner 3feinplils Arrives.
The Kosmos liner Memphis arrived yestjerr
day, 114 days from Hamburg. She brought
about "000 tons of cargo and 19 passengers.
Among the latter, tvas F. P. Flood, a mining
engineer, who came from Acapulco and Is
seriously 111 from Intermittent fever. The
Memphis had an uneventful passage. Her pas
sengers Included the following named:
Mrs. John Barnett. Miss Ruby Barnett,
Jac. Barnett, Sydney Barnett, Mrs.' Ida M.
Brown, Miss Kathie Coakley, Dr. Med.
Husted G. Roy Bullen, F. P. Flood, Mrs.
Flood, Leslie Elliot.
Optima's JPast Passage.
The wonderful passage of the German bark
Optima from this port to Newcastle, Austra
lia, was a well-discussed topic yesterday In
the local marine world. In making the run
across the Pacific from port to port in 37
days the Optima established a new mark for
sailing vpsaels. This is the fastest passage
by a wide margin ever recorded Ixtween
thcRe ports. The Optima Is a four-maatod
bark of 2S45 tons register. She was built In
1S92 at Hamburg, where she is owned.
"Daddy" Blair Celebrates.
"Daddy" Blair, port admiral of the Alaska
Commerolal Company's fleet, yesterday cele
brated tho fortieth anniversary of his first
command. Forty years ago "Daddy" was
mate of the American bark Henry. While at
Palermo loading fruit for New York the cap
tain was taken sick and "Daddy" was placed
In charge. Tlie Henry was a vessel of only
5S5 tons, but Captain John G. Blair still glows
with pride when he talks of his first com
mand and the flash voyage he made In her
on that first voyage. The' captain died dur
ing the passage and "Daddy" retained the
command and wore the title of captain until
somebody, many years ago, dubbed him
"Daddy." and to that name he has answered
ever since.
Schooners in Collision.
The schooner Fanny Adele, coming In from
Grays Harbor Tuesday night about 11 o'clock,
drifted across the bow of the schooner Ad
vent, anchored off Alcatraz. The Advent's
spinnaker. was torn, and to clear the careless
Fanny the Advent had to ellp her anchor and
leave mud hook and 45 fathoms of chain a:
the bottom of the bay. ,
To Go Halibut Fishing.
The scow schooner Kate, Captain Foster,
which sailed yesterday for Port Tbwnsend,
Is to be used in the halibut fishing trade.

THROUGH TRAIN
SERVICE FAILS
."Key Boute" Lacks Both Cars
. and Tracks for a Service
Into Center of Oakland
MORE EQUIPMENT OKDERED
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 3.
It will be $. long while â probably sev
eral yearsâ before the Key Route finds
Its way into Oakland proper.
This is the actual condition of affairs
as admitted by officials of that new
ferry system, though that admission is
not made for publication. v
The people of Oakland have been
wondering why the Key Route has not
been giving Oakland a service. There
are more people In Oakland than In
Berkeley, and the Key Route was com
pelled to come to Oakland for its ter
minal franchises, and Oakland turned
over to that company and the Santa Fe
one entire street, yet Oakland to-day
has no service from the Key Route,
though full trains are run to Berkeley
every trip. This condition of affairs
has given rise to much talk in Oakland,
and it has even been hinted In San
Francisco papers that there was a traf
fic agreement between the new ferry
system and the old.
An official of the Key Route system
made the following: statement in regard
to its service to Oakland, which shows
the condition of the new company:
In the first place, we cannot run "Key
Route" trains into Oakland, because we have
not got the cars. We have only got cars
enough to run trains to Berkeley s and even
these cars are running full to overflowing.
We have been compelled to put into thÂ«
Berkeley service cars that we ha*-e been com
pelled to adapt from other branches of thÂ«
service. We have determined that we will not
attempt to handle more than we can comfort
ably do, and for that reason, if for no other,
we arc confining ourselves to that one service.
In the second place, we cannot run main
line trains down San Pablo avenue, becausÂ»
the flanges on the cars are too deep, and the
rails on that avenue are too shallow. We can
not run the single car that la operated from
Fourteenth street directly out on the pier
without transferring the j passengers at For
tieth street, because the car ts half open, and
an open car cannot be run out on the pier.
We have ordered more cars from *he East,
and v:e expect them shortly, but wiTÂ«n & full
train or even a car will bÂ« run down San
Pablo, avenue into Oakland is & question that
has not yet been decided.
There is no traffic agreement between the
Key Route and the Southern Pacific Company.
We are out after all the business that we
can get. but we are not going to try to
handle business that Is beyond our equipment.
We have ordered all the equipment that we>
can get; until that comes we are not going to
try to handle what Is beyond our maens. We
have got from Berkeley alone more business
than we expected.
As for future work, -we are going to complete
the Piedmont branch along Fortieth street,
but that will not be operated until the new
cars come. rS
When can will be run into Oakland prop*?
is a question. There is a condition surround
ing both cars and tracks. that Is a difficult one
to face.
This is the first definite statement
that has come from Key Route officials
as to why Key. Route trains are not
run into Oakland, and it looks as if the
days when Key Route trains would
come Into Oakland would be far in the^
future.
As a matter of fact Key Route of
ficials have no definite plans as to when
Key Route trains would come into Oak
land. They are confronted with the fact
that they will have to rebuild their San
Pablo avenue line to run high speed
cars on the avenue. They also lack
trackage facilities along that avenue at
the Fourteenth street terminus, and
they also lack trackage facilities at the
end of their pier, go that Oakland's
chances for getting Key Route trains
into the center of town are not very
immediate, and Oakland will have to be
satisfied with its swing car and its ex
tra fare.
ASSOCIATES RECOGNIZE
HER STERLING WORTH
Pacific Mail Office Staff Presents a
Diamond King io Miss Susie
Nicoll.
While the woman in business now
excites no comment in the modern
business world there are few of the
gentle toilers who have made quite
the mark in their field of labor as has
Miss Susie W. Nicoll of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, who tho
other day completed a quarter century
of service with that corporation. Miss
Kicoll's name has " been on the pay
roll longer than any other member
of the office staff. Entrusted v/ith the
carrying out of responsible and ex
acting duties, her ability and sterling
worth are held in peculiar esteem by
the high officials of the soulless cor
poration she has so faithfully served.
Valued by her employers, shÂ» is lov
ed and respected by her associates on
the office staff, who showed something
of their esteem- the other day when

The Lumber Trade.
Pacific Coast Wood and Ircn says cf Lum
ber In January: â¢
"The opening of the fi.'ft month of the
new j-mr found the lumb<Â»r trade of the Pa
cific Coast m a i>fÂ«-uliar!y abnormal condition.
In certain lines the prevailing prices were j
not what they should have b^rn. while in I
others absence of adequate demand forced .
unsatisfactory conditions ujxin both manufac- I
turers and dealc-rs. During the month Just
closed a risible improvement has occurred,
owing to a betternu r.t in the relations of the ,
manufacturers all over the Wfi-t coast. In ,
the red ofiar tfcinRle distrlctn of Washington j
thÂ« Â»Â«>ociaticn controlling over 90 per cent
of the output, have advanced the prices of the
four best grades 10 cents per thousand, leav
ing the culls where they were. The Eastern. (
Washington lumber manufacturers also form
ed a close orpanization which raised prices
all along the line with the result that a ftlffer
market has prevailed during the last fortnight.
The Pacific Northwest status gives excellent
prr>mis# of phapln^ Itself into far better and
lxrcr r oved form.
"Throughout the northrrn districts of Cali
fornia rains have been plentiful and general
trad? conditions are mort promising, but In
th* lrx-a!'.tl<*s Fouth of Stockton there have
been no rains of any consequence, with <he
result that the ajrricultur-sts are In great
m'ant, with live rtock dying on all sides.
The** unfortunate conditions bave & most de
rrefflnt errÂ«-ct upon the lumber markets of
this State anJ unless a eatiefying rain comes
in the nest ten d*yp there will be. little de
mand from the San Joaquin a-id eouth. The
pouthera markets ar* also disturbed over the
r resent troubles between the steamship com
jjsny and the lumber carrying vessels. It Is
riiffleuH to exactly determine Just what the
Â»-xtÂ«nt of this trouble will be, but any dis
turbance is to be rejrretted at this moment.
In and arouni Pan Franciscb the lumber trade
is picking up a little and the worst seems past.
"The Eastern trade, both in shingles anil
lumber for all frrades and species, has fallen
off almost entirely. Thl* Is due to the East
ern buyers holding off until our conditions be
crime more settled."

of its poor December showing. The war out

tlement. although there was nothing decisive
in the day's news. The concurrence of euch
minor ' Influences toward depression had in
j crensed effect by reason of the manifest pass-
I ins ot tlie period of redundancy of money.
; Sub-Treasury requirements and transfers of
i currency to New Orleans have made Inroads
upon the banks' reserves this week, and ln
j terior exchanges are moving against New
York. The intimation from Washington that
I some $30,000,000 of the Panama canal pay
j ment will be withdrawn from deposit with na
tional banks Is of unmistakable authority and
I gives assurance that whatever is done to ar
] range for the payment, nothing will be al
lowed to come as a surprise and unprepared
for by the business world. Borne confidence
Is expressed that the payment can be effected
without any export of gold at all. but the
money market will undoubtedly be more placid
after the operation In concluded.

NEW YORK. Feb. 3. â Buying has not been
as liberal as during the last few days In the
drygoods market, owlnc to the uncertain con
ditions of the raw cotton market. While sell

former position, yet the utmost conservatism

Chicago Board of Trade.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 3.â Cash No. 2 red wheat
sold on the Board of Trade to-day at $1 a
bushel, two carloads changing hands at that
price.. The wheat was bought by millers.
Wheat has not sold so .high In this market,
cither for *pot or future delivery, since June.
1898 In which month the Letter deal cul
minated. The high prices being paid at ChlÂ»
cago arc the direct result of the big deal In
May wheat bring engineered by Armour, liny
wheat sold to-day at the top price for the
season at 04^, a gain of 2^32 >/4c ovÂ«r
yesterday's ciose. The advance was accom
panied by active covering of shorts and much
speculative excitement. Prices for corn, oats
and provisions were also doing some lofty
climbing. May corn was up 3',Ae to 55c; May
oats sold to 1614c a gain of lUc to l%c. and
May Pork to *13 70, a Rain of 25c per barrel.
The display of bullishness was paid to be
largely the result of buying by speculators,
who have made big profits In cotton and have
now transferred their dealings to the grain
and provision markets.
Wheat gathered fresh impetus during tha
nljtht from foreign news Indicating that war
between Russia and Japan now seemed In
evitable Great activity was manifested In
the pit at the atart and prices were on a
higher plane. May was Vi@%c to *g@V4c
higher at 92c to U2&c. while July was up VÂ»c
to %c at 8314c to 83%e. There was a good
general demand for both deliveries and com
mission houses were unusually active on the
bidding side. Shorts were also liberal buyers,
and it was claimed that half a million' bushcU
were taken by the long interests. Offerings
were comparatively light. ' and with auch an
urgent demand the price of May rose rapidly
to 93c. At that figure a lot of long wheat
came 'out mainly from scalpers, and before
th* end of the. first half hour May had reacted
to fl2?4c. Only a. very small demand, however,
was necessary to again start prices on their
upward march. At the end of the first hour"
May had recovered all the early losses and
had advanced still -further to 83 Kc. .Shorts
continued to buy freely and purchases by
commission - houses were a feature. Step by
step the price forged ahead.. Late In the
day. May showed a gain of 2%@2>4c over
yesterday's *nal figures and sold at 04 %c. -a
high record mark for . the crop. July also
maintained its winning gait and advanced to
S5Â©S5%c a gain of 1%@1%c over last night.
There was considerable profit-taking during the
last half hour and , In consequence the market
suffered some' reaction. The close, however,
was strong at 03%(g93%c, a net gain for the
day of an even 2c; July closed at Sl%c. an
advance of l%c.
The corn pit was the scene of a repetition
of yesterday's enormous trading. The volume
of business. In fact; was so large that the
market was extremely hard to follow. One
of the most striking features was the heavy
buying of May corn by the prominent operator
who is said to be practically in control of May
wheat. 'The increased speculative demand was
another noticeable feature. Wall -street traders
were said to be investing heavily in corn. At
times the market took precedence over wheat,
and larger gains were made in this pit than
In either of the other cereals. May corn at
one time showing" an advance of 3%o over last
night's close. The opening was strong Influ
enced to some extent by higher cables. May
being up Ue to %c at 52V6c to' 52$fcc. Some
of the hvrge bull houses Bold -moderately early
In the day. but the offerings â  were â  eagerly
taken by shorts and prices held firm. Toward
the latter- part of the day the interests that
had sold jarly. turned active buyers and the
â¢demand was so persistent that prices rose
rapldjy. Within the last few moments of
trading May sold at Ooc. a gain of 3%c over
last night's close. 1 Final figures were at 54%
053c. â  â  ' 'â â â¢ ' â â¢-#â¢â 
The oat market lost somo.of its independent
strength to-day, but the situation still' re
mained bullish In sympathy with other grains.
There was selling credited to the principal
holder â  but the commission-house trade, was'
: better' than, for . some time past. Small re
i celpta and a good shipping demand were minor
factors in' supporting prices. -May opened a
â¢hade lower to a shade higher at 44%c to 45/:.
The early ' trade was moderate and without
conspicuous featur<Â». shorts - being the best
buyers and â¢ the demand being - supplied by
profit-taking local Jongs. With the sharp ad
vancer in wheat and corn, trading in oat3 be
came â  moro .active and prices, rose steadily,
M^y selling up to 46V4o late In the day.
'.Hre cloao was strong, with May 1 He higher,
at 45%c.
Provision rrlccs moved un sharply on a big
trade. â¢' There was heavy liquidation by those
houres which have been ..successful on
the bull side Of late, but there was enough
! new buying to take all the offerings. The ad-
I vanee was accelerated by heavy covering by
; shorts. Including some of the. nackprs. The

Hay. and Feed stuffs.
Bran and Middlings continue very scarce and
firm. The Oregon steamer Is due to-day with
some 60CU cr 7000 sacks, but it is reported that
mo5t of- the line has already been sold, so there
will not be much to place upon the market.
Hay continues firm at high . prices. The
circular of Somers A Co. says:
"Shipments of Hay have been quite heavy
during the past week, the total amounting to
3500 tons, tn comparison with Â£J)0O tons for the
week preceding. Neither the weather condi
tions nor stocks of Hay In the country have
warranted such free shipments, but they have |
been ordered ip simply to supply the demand, t
About 100 tons are dally taken from the mar-.]
ket to be baled up for Government purposes
and It Is expected that the entire shipment of
3750 tons will be made toward tho end of the
month. Aside from the matter of weather we
belteve the condition of the Hay market to
be rather critical, for with the heavy drains
on country stocks It becins to look as though
we would not have enough to last "us through.
Southern California has been calling on us
for a little Hay, with the probability of want
ing more right alonsr, and now Oreson and
Washington want to know what wo can do for
them. To the south of us large quantities of
Hay are' now beinc consumed because of the
drought, .and the entire State Is In rather- bad
shape. â¢
"Owing to the strong demand, both In the;
country and In tho city, prices have advanced .
somewhat and will continue go to> do until we
have rain. A good storm would probably have
the effect of preventing a still further advance
for th# next month or two. Although to a very I
great extent the Hay market Is not â¢ weather :
market, being controlled almost entirely by the
ras> ft '- of supply and demand. Some grades
have advanced f.Oc per ton. while others are
fully $1 per ten hlgcher."

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market had a steadier tone and
buyers who had been holding off for some days
i In anticipation of low'r prices were obliged f
to pay full figures. The demand showed no }
great Improvement, but available supplies v.ere â¢
controlled by a few dealers and there was no j
competition or cutting of prices, hence the
firmer fcellnn. Swctts were inclined toeasl-l
nea* and a carload of fresh stock was offeretl j
at a decline. Onions ruled firm under llmltfd
supplies and two freshly arrived carloads of
Oregon stock wcrt firmly held at the maximum
quotation. |
Small quantities of new Potatoes were re
ceived from several places In Alameda County

Poultry and Game.
There was no Western Poultry offering and
the market for local stock had a better tone in
consequence. The demand, however, was noth
ing fextra and prices of all descriptions were
unchanged. FinÂ«- young fowl sold off fairly,
whllft old Hens and Roosters, which constituted
the bulk of the supplies, were Inclined to drag
Two cars of Western fall due to-day. A few
cases of- dressed Turkeys came in and sold at
slightly firmer rates. â¢ . â¢

a small quantity of wild Ducks and they sold
readily at previous prices, while all other kinds

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There is no change In Butter or Cheese. Tho
former is fairly steady, though some houses
are beginning: to repcrt an easier feeling. The
Cheese market is still overstocxed and dull.
The .situation In E&gs at tho moment Is this:
The demand for shipment Is still brisk and the
shippers will pay 2T>@2<io for anything fresh,
but will not touch the very finest ranch at even
%C over the latter figure. The result Is that,
the 27c EÂ«gs are given the go-by and those'
under 27c are kept cleaned up. Receipts con
tinue to increase, as will be seen, though yes
terday they were slightly below those of the
preceding day. The general market Is firm,
but the trade are looking for a decline any
day now, as the production always Increases
at this time of the year.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The cool, cloudy weather continued to operate
against the sale of . Oransea and the local de
mand was confined chiefly to the large sizes of
Navels, CCs having the most call, and such
offerings were firmly held at a premium. Small
and medium sized fruit was neglected and could
net be mcved, even at liberal .. concessions.
Business In . the auction rooms reflected the
conditions that prevailed in -the open market.
Four carÂ« of ordinary fruit nnd one of extra
fancy Redlands were sold. The extra fancy
sold from $1 45 to $1 00. with 20 boxes of ft6s
selling at $2 50. Ordinary fancy sold at $1 20W

Hides, Tallozv, Wool and Hops.
The trade yesterday quoted a quieter feeling
In Heps, saying that the brewers here arÂ« well
stftcked up while in the Eaat the extremely
coid wather Is restricting the brewing demand.
TViey furthermore say that business In 1903
Hops Is practically over for the season, as there
are hardly any left.
A local house says of Wool: "The Wool
warehouses are being rapidly cleaned out of
stock and It looks as If there would be no oM â 
or 100a Wool orrhand by March 1. The outlook ,
Is not at all encouraging for California grow- j
ers for the present year, as down the coast the
stock men are very much worried by lack of ]
rain and feed, and reports of serious losses (
among cattleman are coming to hand. Sheep
have" not suffered so much, but necessarily there
will be losses among Sheep soon unless latÂ«
rains help things out. The Sacramento Valley
haa had sufficient rains to make rrass and
crops and no doubt many of the middle coun
ties and most of the southern counties will be
soon seeking new pastures north, as soon after
lambing and shearing as they can make a start.
If tho Government would open Us reservations
lor the summer it would rave millions of dol
lars to the stockmen and would entail no hard
ship on the Government for a season."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL", THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1904.
SOEDER MUST
FACE JURORS
Leon Soeder Will Be Tried in
. the Siperior Court on the
Charge of Murdering Blaise
CABANISS GIVES DECISION
Extra 'Time Is Allotted to the.
Defense in Which to Attempt
to. Rebut Prosecution's Case
Judge Cabaniss will bind Leon Soe
der over to-the Superior Court for trial.
Yesterday's session of Judge Caban
iss' court was opened by the closing
argument of the defense by Attorney
Salomon. He reviewed the evidence of
the prosecution and attempted to show
wherein a great portion of It was ir
relevant; that the police had no chain
of evidence, merely a chain of suspi
cions. He assailed the veracity and
character of the tenderloin witnesses
for the prosecution, and said that the
police had distorted some peculiar cir
cumstances into evidence. He stated
that the testimony of Frank Cannon
and Miss Catherine Flatley had no con
nection with the murder case, and re
ferred to the landlord as "the voluble
Mexican, who testified to one thing
one moment and denied It the next."
Salomon showed by the testimony of
the women who keep the Mexican res
taurant and the statement of Dr.
Bothe, the city chemist, that Blaise
must have been killed between the
hours of 7 and 8 o'clock on the night
of January 10. The attorney attrib
uted the issuance and application of
so many insurance policies to the vigil
ance of insurance solicitors, who, he
said, swarmed after Soeder and Blaise.
Salomon then cited a story where an
Innocent man was, hanged by a chain
of circumstantial "evidence, in" an at
tempt to show the court the danger of
acting on such evidence.
HAXLEY MAKES ARGUMENT.
Assistant District Attorney Hanley,
who has handled the case for the prose
cution, replied to Saloman's argument
and went over what points the prose
cution 'iad attempted to show by the
introduction of so much apparently ir
relevant testimony. He spoke of the
plot that Soeder had presumably con
cocted, his trip to France, the persuad
ing of his brother-in-law to accompany
him to San Francisco under the pre
text that he would secure for him a
good position and the many attempts
by Soeder to secure }ife insurance soon
after his arrival in this country. He
told of the straitened circumstances
Soeder was In, how he was compelled
to pawn everything of value he pos
sessed to get money to pay the prem
iums on the policies that he applied
for on the life of Blaise. He told of
the desire of Soeder to make Miss
Flatley his wife, his representing to
her that he was to receive a legacy
of $10,000 from an estate in Germany,
and his attempt on his return to this
city to keep his presence unknown to
his expected bride until he should be
in a, position to say, "Now I have the
money that I promised you to have
when I married you."' *
Attorney Hanley told of the suspi
cious circumstances which pointed to
Soeder as the murderer; of Seeder's at
tempt to establish an alibi by going to
the residence of his German friends In
the Mission and writing a letter to him
self, so that his* receipt of it might im
press more firmly on the minds of*his
German friends his visit to their place
when he pretended to be searching for
his brother-in-law.'
He showed that Soeder was not in
his room on the night of the murder be
fore 12 o'clock, as the letter received by
him at the Melenberg place in the Mis
sion was mailed by Soeder after 12
o'clock on the night of the murder, as
the stamp 5 a. m., January 11, Indi
cates. Another incident that went to
show that Soeder was -not in his room
on the night was the testimony of Te
resa King, who saw him in the O. K.
saloon at 9:50 o'clock on the night of
the murder. Â«â¢
SOEDER AVAS IGNORANT.
Hanley stated that Soeder did not
know to this day from any word re
ceived from the Aetna Insurance Com
pany that his application for a $5000
policy on the life of Blaise had .been* re
jected, neither was he aware that he
was not to receive the $7000 policy from
the Hartford Company.
The fact, the attorney said, that Soe
der wrote to Miss Flatley that his Ger
man friend, Blaise, was going home
soon shows that he was having diffi
culty in holding Blaise in the city until
he could secure heavy Insurance on his
life. He had to kill him in San Fran
cisco, and so killed him on the night of
January 10.
The knife introduced in evidence
Tuesday was seen constantly in Soe
der's possession by the landlord, Nei
blas, and his wife, and it would have
been suspicious for Soeder to remove it
on the day that the murder was dis
covered. Therefore he left it lying open
in plain view on the table, with the
hope of having the police overlook it as
an unimportant piece of evidence. Soe
der cleaned the knife, but the blood re
mained around the handle and the joint
of the blade. â¢
When Hanley had finished Judge Ca
baniss stated that he was ready to
deny a motion for dismissal on the part
of Attorney Salomon. He said:
I shall have to denr the motion for a dis
missal of thin case. I am not nearly bo per
suaded as Mr. Hanley that all of the testi
mony is admissible. When I come to formally
dispose of tho case I shall ignore the testi
jfnony of the Flatley woman, of Cannon and
of some othÂ«r witnesses whose testimony pur
sues the same general theory.
CABAXISS REVIEWS CASE.
I am Bitting: as a committing: Judge, and It
Is not for me to find the defendant guilty. It
Is enough that there Is sufficient evidence to
believe htm guilty. There are three or four
pieces of evidences on which I base my denial
of the motion, tin the first place, Blaise was
beyond a doubt murdered. The' defendant was
arrÂ«>sted. brought to the Hall of Justice, and
the question arose: What motive could there
have be*n for the murder? We find that the
life of Blaise was insured so that Soeder was
the beneficiary to at least the sum of $3000.
That circumstance alone, It seems to me, stands
out against the defendant. The law generally
frowns against transactions of this nature
where one- man makes himself the beneficiary
in an insurance policy on another's life. The
law shows that where a man wishes to benefit
by the death of another he is under great
temptation to do Just what tho deefendant In
this case Is accused ofâ killing his brother-in
law. 60 that he might get the ' money repre
sented In the policies on his life. The one
fact that has been brought out, that the de
fendant was of a penurious nature. Is borne
out by the fact that immediately on receiving:
the awful, news of his â¢ brother-in-law's death
he at once thinks of the insurance policies
and the pecuniary assistance that. he expected
to derive from their payment.
Judge Cabaniss at this stage of his
address took a peculiar stand, when he
stated that it was his belief that the
gripman Vose saw Blaise, whom he de
scribed as an exerted German, on Union
street on the night of . the murder at
8:30 o'clock. Testimony had been intro
duced that phows that Blaise and Soe
der left the Mexican restaurant at 6 or
6:15 o'clock on the. night of the murder.
City Chemist Bothe found from a mi
croscopical examination^ of the food in
the dead man's . stomach that Blaise
had been killed an hour or an hour and
a half after *he eating of the meal. This
would bring the time of the murder at
the widest interval' not later than - 8
PARTED TWICE
IN TWO YEARS
Eemarriage of Chester and Ta
hpe.D. Wright Kesults in
Second Appeal for Divorce
MERCHANT BEATS HIS WIFE
Judge Sloss Gives Relief to
Woman Who Testifies That
She Was Cruelly Abused
/For the second time within two years
have Tahoe D. Wright and Chester F.
Wright, the wealthy corset manu
facturer, been, separated by a decree
of the court. Judge Murasky, about
the 1st of June, 1902, ga,ve Mrs. Wright
a divorce on the ground of cruelty.
Ten days later they were remarried
and went abroad. After ten months
they returned and Mrs. Wright, a few
days after reaching home, filed a suit
for divorce, practically repeating the
charges of cruelty made in her first
suit. This suit was' heard yesterday by
Judge Slo'ss, who awarded Mrs.
a decree after listening 'to testimony
that showed that Wright is a fit sub
ject for a whipping post. Their prop
erty rights were settled out of court,
Mrs. Wright having asked for $350 a
month alimony.
The only witnesses examined were
Mrs. Wright, Mrs. William Pomin, her
mother, and Robert McNeil, a boy about
13 years of age. The latter testified
that one night when he was passing
Wright's Ellis street store he heard a
commotion inside, and on peering
through the door saw Wright cruelly
beating his wife. "
"What did you do?" asked Judge
Sloss. .
"I tapped on the window," said the
sturdy little fellow, "and when Wright
came to the door I told him that any
man who would beat a woman ought
to be arrested, and then I ran away."
MrS. -Wright's testimony was to the
effect that Wright had treated her in
an inhuman manner during /the eight
months that preceded the filing of the
second suit for divorce. She said that
he struck her with great frequency,
constantly called her vile names and
kicked her so many times that she
could not specify the dates. She said
that once he threw a lighted cigar in
her face and told her "that if he fol
lowed his inclinations he would kill
her."
Mrs. Pomin testified to the effect
Wright's treatment had on his wife.
She said that at the time of her. second
marriage her daughter was in prime
physical health and that ten months
later she was a mental and physical
wreck._
At the time Mrs. Wright secured her
first decree of divorce she was awarded
$15,000 as her share of the community
property.

Prosecuting Attorney Hanley at the
time of placing Vose on the stand said
that his testimony was unimportant.
Detective Gibson said the same, and
that they merely placed Vose on the
stand to satisfy his clamoring to be
heard.
ACCUC^D MAN'S ANXIETY.
Judge Cabaniss narrated the attempt
on Soeder's part to display anxiety at
the absence of Blaise, and dwelt on the
fact that Soeder tried to impress on
every one that Blaise had been robbed,
that he had $90 on his person. He said:
That Is Just precisely what I should expect
the murderer to do. The defendant was evi
dently very anxious to enow that Blaise had
been robbtd. This was. of course. In keeping
with the turning Inside out of the dead man's
pockets. Now, 'this part of the work was over
done. A robber might accidentally leave a
man's pockets turned lnelde out. but would
never take the time nor tend to leave any
thing to show that robbery had been com
mitted by turning carefully Inside out every
pocket In the trousers. It appears to have
been the work of some one who desired to con
vey the robbery theory to the police.
Soeder treated the news of his brother-in
law's death very lightly by saying, "Go on;
go 'way," where but an hour or so before he
had attempted to Impress on the landlord and
landlady and his- friends In the Mission that
he feared that Blaise had met foul play.
The man has placed himself under suspicion,
and I shall have to deny the motion for a dis
missal of "the case.
Attorney Salomon objected to the
Judge's decision and asked that he be
given an hour to-day in which to in
troduce some more'evidence for the de-
I fense. This was granted, -and this
morning at 11 o'clock Salomon will at
tempt to rebut some of the prosecu
tion's testimony, but Judge Cabaniss'
; decision will In all probability hold good
i after he has finished.
Soeder has sat throughout the hear
ing during the last week and tried to
appear unconcerned as the testimony
piled up against him. During the last
few days the ordeal he has been under
going has shown plainly on his face.
When the Judge was reviewing the case
yesterday Soeder watched him intently,
but - whenever Judge Cabaniss looked'
directly at the accused man Soeder
hung his eyes. He never looks any one
in the face and his eyes are constantly
shifting.
As Judge Cabaniss made known his
decision to hold him ! for trial Soeder's
frame shook visibly and then seemed to
relax into a. resigned state. As he was
being led back to the prison his > eyes
were upon the floor and did not attempt
to meet the curious gaze of the crowds
that lined the corridors. __,
DUFFY TELLS
ON WONG DIN
Expressman Swears Against
the Chinese Schemer Who
Planned Ma' Foo's Escape
IS A WILLING WITNESS
Owing to the Vigilance and
Honesty of Deputy Marshal
Burnham, Plot Is Exposed
Wong Din was placed on trial before
a jury yesterday in the United Rtates
District Court on an indictment charg
ing him with having conspired with
John Duffy to secure the illegal land
ing of Ma Foo, a Chinese coolie, by
substituting another Chinaman for
him. The case will be argued this
morning. United States District At
torney Marshall B. Woodworth and
Assistant United States Attorney Ben
L. McKinley appear on behalf of the
Government and Bert Schlesinger for
the defendant.
The testimony was to the effect that
on January 30, 1902, John Duffy, em
ployed by Herbert Creighton, express
man for the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, took a Chinese immigrant
named Ma Foo from the detention shed
at the Mail dock to Brown's â¢ photo
graph eallery on Kearny street to get
his portrait taken 1 efore handing him
over to the United States Marshal in
obedience to a writ of habeas corpus
served upon the master of the steam
ship Gaelic, on which, vessel Ma Foo
arrived from China, After the pic
ture had been taken. Duffy brought
Ma Foo downstairs, and in the door
way facing Kearny street, on the
ground floor, he foung Wong Din and
an elderly Chinaman. Duffy handed
Ma Foo to Wong Din and brought the
elderly Chinese coolie to the office of
the United States Marshal.
Had it not been for the vigilance of
Deputy United States Marshal George
A. Burnham, the substitution would
never have been discovered. Burnham
happened to be in the gallery on an
other case when Duffy arrived with
Ma Foo. An hour later Burnham re
turned to the Marshal's office and
found an elderly Chinese in the pris
oners' room. On being informed by
Clerk Farish that the old 1 man was >la
Foo, Burnham replied that the Ma Foo
he had seen with Duffy at the photog
rapher's was a young man and was
not the prisoner then in the Marshal's
office. An investigation followed, with
the result that Duffy was convicted
and served a two months' term of im
prisonment In the County Jail and the
pretended Ma Foo served a like sen
tence.
Duffy was a willing witness for the
Government in the present trial. He
testified that Wong Din hay made an
agreement to pay him ; $100 for each
Chinaman whom he might succeed in
substituting, and that wong Din had
given him the false Ma Foo in ex
change for the genuine one at the pho
tograph gallery. He said he had not
been paid by Wong Din for the Ma
Foo substitution, but that Wong Din
had paid him $220 for other substitu
tions, the names and dates of which he
could not remember.
When Duffy was on trial two years
ago he refused to reveal the name of
the Chinaman with whom he had been
connected in the affair, but after Wong
Din had been arrested for complicity
with Deputy United States Marshal
Gamble and Jailers Dasha, Dempsey
and Burnett, Duffy told the prosecu
tion all he knew.

EXAMINATION
SET FOR JUNE
Board of Education Will Hold
Another Test for. Applicants
for Positions as Teachers
The Board of Education will shortly
begin preparations for the holding: of
another competitive examination of
applicants for positions as teachers in,
the school department. The examina
tion will be held on some day in June
yet to be selected, and as formerly will
consist of a written and oral test.
The necessity for holding another ex
amination will become apparent when
it is known that of the successful com
petitors in the last" one flfty-flve stand
ing highest- off. the list have been as
signed to i^sitions. The board Is of
the opinion that at least fifteen more
will be assigned from the eligible list
before the holding of the June exam
ination.
It is expected that the nftmber of
those who will take the June examina
tion will be unusually large, owing to
the fact that additional teachers will
be in demand on account of the new
school buildings being erected under
the bond issue, the legality of which
will be decided next year by the Su
preme Court.
A statement prepared yesterday in
the office of the board shows that there
are at present forty-two teachers on
leaves of absence. Some of these .will
probably not return to resume teaching,
and this will necessitate the appoint
ment of new teachers to their places
as" soon as their resignations are pre
sented and accepted.
The Board of Education will meet to
day and assign several teachers to the
evening substitute list. ThN attendance
at the evening schools is constantly on
the increase and substitutes are often
pressed into service.
The board will also make arrange
ments for the installation of a uniform
gong system in all of the schools. The
gongs will be utilized in the holding of
flre drills in order that pupils may ac
custom themselves to act coolly in
cases of emergency.
The members of the board visited the
schools in the North Beach district
yesterday. The Cooper, Hancock and
Jean Dwyer schools were inspected and
were all found to be crowded with
pupils. The attendance is so large that
the board feels that additional class
rooms should be established in the
three schools, but owing to lack of
funds will be prevented from doing so.
The Chinese Primary School was also
visited, its attendance being compara
tively light owing to the observation
of Chinese New Tear. After the cele
bration is over the school will have an
Increased attendance.
