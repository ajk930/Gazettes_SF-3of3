ST. PETERSBUR. June 22.-Bands of
insurgents in the district of Scharonkhau,
Province of Erivan, Trans-Caucasia, re
cently sacked and burned four Armenian
villages. Subsequently they surrounded
Oianoraschau. The inhabitants of the
town repulsed the besiegers, killing 100 of
them. Troops stationed at the village or
Khuuloundian also repulsed an attack ot
the insurgents on that place, inflicting
enormous losses and capturing &70 pris
oners, a quantity of arms and a black
standard.
The insurgent chiefs and Mullahs were
executed. Proclamations were found ex
horting' neighboring villages to join in a
war against the common enemy.
The agitation is spreading. A number
of Armenian villages, containing about
TUOO inhabitants, have been surrounded,
and skirmishes between the Tartars and
Kurds and the Russian troops are fre
quent. The villages of Ouschi and Kis
thyken have been burned. Five thou
sand Cossacks are expected from Baku to
aid in suppressing the rising.
The insurgents are estimated to num

The wreck had no effect on", the sale
of tickets . for the same train* to-night,
the full quota allotted to this city hav
ing been sold long before the, time x of
the train's departure. : ' - :
W. H. Marshall, general , manager of
the Lake Shore, belleverf the speed of the
train was not a contributory cause to
the wreck. He said that other Lake
Shore trains travel , through Mentor, at
a speed equal to that attained 'by the
Twentieth Century laÂ«t night which was
not, Mr. Marshall 6ald,,above the rate
of sixty miles an hour. The schedule
for the train called for a speed- of
fifty-seven miles an hour . at ' that point.
As to who Is responsible for the open
switch which was the cause of the
wreck the railroad officials are still un
certain. A careful examination of the
switch to-day showed that it was in
perfect condition.
Detectives are working \u25a0on the case.
Trainmen are of the opinion that the
crew of the Twentieth Century was de
ceived by a second white light one hun
dred feet beyond the switch which was
open, but while traveling at such fast
speed were unable to gauge the distance
and. mistook the ' second light for ! the
flr6t one. - '

twenty minutes after it "occurred. On;

tern. They Questioned him, and he said J
that he hud been down to shut a switch." .1
The men ivent to the soeri<i of the wreck,
and found the switch open, hut locked. .
The men are of the opinion that the boy
thought that there was a freight ahead
of the Twentieth Century and opened
the switch to let it through and . v take
a sldinqr, and that he meant, to open tho
switch Instead of closing it.

Beginning with the earliest morning
hours, the streets of the Inner city of
Vienna were filled .with movement and
life in expectation of the coming proces
sion, and by 7 o'clock the windows, ' bal
conies and stands along the line of march
were crowded with people. The streets
\u25a0were decorated with flags, boughs of
trees and many colored hangings, and at
convenient places temporary open air "al
tars had been erected.
The procession started from the Hof
burg, proceeded to the cathedral on . the
Stefansplatz. where the religious ceremo
nies were held, and then returned to the
Hofburg. J â¢
Gorgeous colors, crimson, gold and sil
ver, magnificent uniforms and trappings,
glowing" tunics, the clanking ; march of
soldiers and the 6ilent tread of the clergy
is strange contrast, the Cashing of jew
els and the glare in the sunlight of the
white robes of the priests, brilliant splen
dor and silent prayers marked the prog
ress of the sacred and military, procession
in honor of the consecrated host.
ThÂ« lesser clergy came first. Then
Â«querrles, pages and others of the Impe
rial household. Kettle drummers In gala
uniform, the court chamberlains, many
high personages of state, generals and
other high military officers followed. The
host was borne by the Archbishop" of
Vienna, surrounded by prelates of the
church, and after him came the Emperor.
In former years it was , the custom : to
walk, but now, because of his age, ,he
rides. He appeared to-day In .a,- gala
coach drawn by eight royal white horses,
and was accompanied by Archduke Franz
Ferdinand, the successor to the throne.
The* other Archdukes, all in magnificent
uniforms, with royal carriages, came
after: the: Emperor. .
The procession marched 'to' the main
entrance of the cathedral and went in
through -the broad doors' facing on ; the
Stef ensplatz. After - the religious cere
monies it took Its -way., back ' to the | Hof
burg over another line of, march In order
to give the people of the city Increased
opportunities to witness Its- large . .pa
geantry- From balconies -of Ithe palace
the procession was witnessed by" the
Archduchess and her children.
The ceremony came to ah : end. with* the
defiling before the, Emperor of the troops
which had taken : part therein; "
VIENNA, June 22.â Amid accompani
ments of medieval jiomp and circum
stance, the aged Emperor of Austria,
King of Hungary. Bohemia, etc., Francis
Joseph, took part in the yearly Corpus
Chriiti procession in Vienna to-day. He
was greeted enthusiastically by his peo
ple as he was driven through the streets
of the inner city. It was the universal
dictum of the Viennese that their Emper
or had aged greatly since they last paw
him partake in this ceremony two years
ago . and the appearance of Francis Jo
seph, trlio will, if he lives, celebrate the
sixtieth- anniversary of his accession to
the throne in 1908, suggested to many
minds that this may be the last time the
venerable monarch will appear before his
people as a participant in this beautiful
festival of the Catholic church.

WASHINGTON. June 22.â The recent dis
missal by order of the Presiaent of ; Pay^
Inspector John _ Clyde â¢ Sullivan ;"Jof ;* the
United States navy; ends a 3 career. in the
naval service probably, without precedent
by reason of . the . fact that the disgraced
officer has : been" twice., summarily;. : dls-'
missed from the navy.
Sullivan was appointed from Ohio dur
ing the term of office of Secretary of the
Navy Hunt; He had a somewhat tum
ultuous time; in various ; parts of the
world and came* to grief at ,the Mare
Island Navy Yard. California. 7
Charges were ; brought 'against him in
effect that he was short in his accounts
to the extent of several" thousand dollars."
An inspector was detailed to examine his
books, but before ' his 'â¢ arrival ',i Sullivan
went ashore from a vessel in the j Harbor
to which \u25a0 he ' was attached, proceeded 'to
Vallejo and called . upon several persons
to "whom he was indebted^ telling them^
it is claimed, that he needed about $12,000
temporarily." .It is ' also said that Sulli
van was indeDted a toV these; persons* and
in order to obtain' the r amount necessary
to cover the delinquency made the cold
blooded statement to. them that if he did
not get the funds he' would be dismissed
from the service I and | their chances - : for
repayment of old debts would be" decided^
ly slim. ' His creditors took a .' further
chance and "advanced "him ; the . required
amount with ,the understanding, that "the
loan would be for a short time only.";; Su
llivan thenrepaired to his ship to place in
his safe the 'money ; necessary r to cover
up his alleged defalcations.; .i â¢.
It had become;; well r known -about the
Mare Island Navy. i Yard that i the ; pay
master was in', financial difficulties' and
.orders were; issued, by) his 1 commanding
officer that when, he came from
his trip to "; Vallejo r he ; should 'â¢ be \ placed
under arrest. For some Treason ; unknown
the officer of, the; deck r did moti not execute
the orders, which -gave-; Sullivan, an -op
portunity to | reach s; his 'office i and i cover
his actions . before he was held to account.
As the -navy; system : of ; boomteeplng "is
peculiar, the . books . showed , an, irregular

The best information is that the Presi
dent will take no further action concern
ing Loomis at present. Loomis will . go
on his vacation, which will ' help the af
fair to slip out of sight. The President is
disposed to stand by Loomis and to dem
onstrate that he does not consider/ him
smirched, but it is thought improbable
that. the administration would welcome
a fight with some, such as .would
be provoked by Loomis' nomination for
an important diplomatic pos^Â» '-. , -
There is a disposition, here to discredit
Bowen's statement that after he \u25a0 had
made charges against t iÂ»omis ; here, ho
was offered a change of post to Chile;
with the understanding he could ' later
be Mlcister to Brazil. : ' - r* 3/
The â¢ manner <in which Secretary Taft
criticized Loomis' action as Minister to
Venezuela and the approval by the Presi
dent of Mr. Taft's remarks, it is now
thought, precludes the possibility of Loo
mis serving as Minister to Japan. In the
highest administration, circles there is a
feeling that sufficient opposition will | be
mustered by the Bowen forces to prevent
confirmation of Loomis' nomination to
any "post to which the President ' might
desire to transfer or promote him.
Aside from charges of which Loomis
has now been cleared,- there is consider
able hostility to him in the, Senate. He
had a v liberal- share of the criticism of
the administration's ' initial steps in the
Santo Dominjro affair.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, June 22.â Francis B. Loo
mis, .who has been.' exonerated pf, charges
against his official Integrity, but criticized
by Secretary Taft for indiscretion in per
sonal business ventures when Minister to
Venezuela, will not much longer actively
serve as Assistant Secretary of State; the
post be has had for more than two years.
He has already planned to go to Europe
for part of a two months' leave to which
he is entitled. He has engaged passage
on the Pniladelphia, sailing from New
York on Saturday, and plans to stay in
Europe only a short time.
Entirely apart from the Bowen-Loomis
scandal. President Roosevelt, as an
nounced exclusively in The Cajl recently,
decided many weeks ago to make Lloyd
C. Griscom, now American Minister to
Japan, Assistant Secretary of State, and
had thought of sending Loomis to fill the
vacancy in Tokio. There Is a probabil
ity that Japan will soon seek to raise her
diplomatic representative to the United
States to the rank of Embassador.
Loomis said to-night that he had no in
tention of resigning.

Wben Minnie Adams beard the father
of the child she Is accused of murdering
tell on the witness stand yesterday how
she threatened to poison the little one,
the turned deathly white and almost col
lapsed. "When I caw that the baby's
lips were burned, I said, 'Minnie, you did
this; you know you did this.' " testified
"Wilson Gray, the dead child's father.
The woman shuddered and her face
twitched In agony.
For six years the unhappy creature
has been In prison. This Is her second
trial. The child to whom she is accused
of giving: carbolic acid came to its death
on March 13, ISS3. She was not married
to Gray and according to him she seemed
to hate the little thing, probably because
It reminded her of her disgrace, j
A morbid crowd filled Judge LÂ»awlor's
court to watch the tortured woman.
Gray spoke of his relations with the
defendant and their frequent quarrel-
Ing's about the child. About three
week; before Its death she had said to
him: "The little boy found a bottle of
carbolic acid, but I took It from him.
If he finds it again I won't take It from
him, but may give It to him." When
he received a card telling him that his
baby was dead he went to 117 Park
ayenuc and accused the defendant of
causing its death, remembering, what
she had said to him three weeks be
fore, but she denied it, saying she knew
he would accuse her. He believed that
she had sent him the card telling him
of the boy's death.
.During the time Gray was giving his
testimony the defendant kept her eyes
steadily fixed upon him. but he avoided
her gaze. She seemed aroused at times
by what he said, but foreboreto make
an exhibition in court. ' Several times'
she whispered eagerly toher attorneys.
Gray was put through a severe cross
examination by Attorney Henry C Dib
ble. The witness admitted that he had
* been arrested on the complaint of the
defendant for pointing a revolver at
her an4.^takjjjs, from her $265, which
she had Â«jved. birt; he said the case had
been dismissed, as there was' no truth"
In her charges. He also admitted hav
ing sola the furniture in /the house
where they. had lived, but. said he bad
Siven' hÂ«r more than halt or the 'tnohÂ£y.
His further cross-examination will be
continued on Monday morning.

PORTLAND. June 23.â Colonel Rich
ardson of Kentucky, secretary of the. Na
tional Good Roads' Association, shook
h's. flat under the nose of President
Moore, after a riotous meeting of- the
body this afternoon and told him he
lied. Oregon, Washington and Idaho
delegations dominate the convention now
In session, and these Northwestern dale
gates arÂ« almost a unit In favor of the
election of Colonel Richardson to the
presidency. - Â»
President Moore, it is said by arbitrary
rulings, endeavored to prevent the annual'
election until a later â¢ meeting in the fall
to be" held in Missouri, when the
incumbent expects to face a friendly
body. Trouble came when the order of
business .called for the election 'of \u25a0 offi
cers. :, ' -;' - -â¢"â¢
"We will pass the election of; officers
at this time," eaid President Moore. On
motion the question was put to vote and
a few voices voted aye for postponement.
A roar of noes followed, but the president
declared the motion carried. \u25a0 . :..
In a moment a pandemonium broke loose.
Nearly every delegate in the house -was
on his feet. Frail chairs gave way under
the unusual strain aa heavy . men leaped
upon them in the effort to gain the.pre
siding offlcer's eye. Finally Colonel Rich
ardson was recognized and entered an
earnest protest. . â¢ ... ..\u25a0 ...
President Moore attempted to interrupt
the speaker, but was forced to let. him
proceed 'by the clamor of voices.,.. ,:
Senator. Mann of Maine poured oil on
the troubled waters by begging the dele
gates not to allow the worst aspects of
a political convention to spoil the good
work of the convention and demanded
the regular order of business. . ; . -
The fight will be renewed again . to
morrow when it will be decided whether
an election shall be held at this time or
the association be put to -the trouble and
expense of holding a convention later in
the year. The real Issue Is whether tSe
present convention Is national in charac
ter; if it is the election will be held

i Senator was returning to : Portland v a
short time prior to his first indictment. E
Judge Tanner told of having received
a telegram from the Senator, asking him
to come as far as Kalama, Wash.,- to
meet him. The Judge had taken the trip
and had met the Senator; on the train
with Blnger; Hermann and Frank C.
Baker, chairman of the Republican State
Central Committee. The Senator, he said,
was very eager, for land fraud news, and
asked if there was any [ danger of. the
Government agents having had access to
the books of the firm. Mitchell expressed,
said the witness, deep concern about the
entries and transactions the firm had had
with Kribs and .wanted to see the books.
" The following day, Judge .Tanner testi
fied, the Senator went : to the office and
In company with him (Tanner), looked
over the books page by page. According
to the testimony of /the Judge, Mitchell
expressed surprise at the way the entries
had been made and demanded that the
old books be destroyed, saying the entries
in regard to the Kribs transactions would
not only Indict but would convict him if
they fell into the hands of the Govern

:. Judge "Tanner testified that he had told
the Senator that though it would necessi

such a | thing in his life, he wpuld stand
by his partner and . do what he could to
help him. He had agreed to destroy the
books if necessary, and had called the

President Makes Several Speeches Dur
in*f Ills Stay la Massachusetts. \u0084 '
WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., June 22.â
The zigzag journey of President Roose
velt among the colleges of Western
Maesachusetts ended to-day with his de
parture from Willi&metown after he had
received from Williams college the hon- ,
orary degree of L. H. D. His stay in this
State, which was of scarcely thirty-two
hours' duration, was a busy one. He at
tended three college commencements, at
two of which he received high honorary
degrees; traveled several hundred miles,
and besides delivering significant' ad
dresses at each commencement, made a
number of speeches from the platform
of his car to citliens who had gathered
at the stations along the route.
The President rose early to-day and
leaned from a window enjoying the su
perb view of Berkshire County. After
breakfast the President devoted a few
minutes to meeting the classmates of
Federal Commissioner James R. Garfleld,
mho is a trustee of Williams, and then
made a quick inspection of the new me
morial chapel dedicated yesterday. '\u25a0> .
After a short walk the President ac
cepted the invitation of .his host for a
drive which ended just before the com
mencement exercises began. \u25a0 He spoke
twice here, once upon receiving the de
gree and again from the steps of the I
church where ,the commencement exer
cises were held, to the people who could
not get into the auditorium.
Then came luncheon and before 2
o'clock the President was on his way
back to Washington. His train made
\u25a0tops at North Adams, Adams and l-.its
fleld, where the citizens joined in demon
strations, and were addressed briefly by
Mr. Roosevelt.
During the trip there was not an un
pleasant incident. Yesterday's rain was
disagreeable, but to-day, though the
skies were cloudy, no rain fell until after
the train bearing the President had start
ed south.
The feature of the exercises at Wil
liams College was the conferring of
the honorary degrees. Besides the
President, former Secretary Root and
former Embassador Choate, the re
cipients of degrees included Stephen L.
Penrose, president of the Whitman Col
lege, State of Washington, doctor of
divinity.
President Roosevelt delivered a short
address, in which he said: "I want to
say a word about idealism in politics.
I like to see every graduate uphold his
standard of political idealism in his
life. The ideals must not be high and
fantastic or* low and impracticable. Do
not delude yourself to the belief that
fantastic Ideals are an indication of a ;
superior virtue. Adopt strong," prac- |
tlcal Ideals and then strive to follow
them as Washington and Lincoln fol
lowed, their ideals. Do not abandon ',
idealism because it does not seem to
work out in your case." \u25a0 ' â¢ \~
The President eaid he desired the
assistance in the working" out of all;-;
Government problems of all- the col- I
leges In the country,- "We hava a right
to expect from the'cqllegeV \u25a0 ea!dÂ« he,.;
"efficient leadership." ' * i
The President discussed briefly, by i
way of Illustration, the Santo Domingo
question. He said the island Govern- '
ment bonds of society were , on the \u25a0
point of dissolution. The United States ;
was appealed to to help the weaker |
brother. There was apprehennlon that i
Santo Domingo might- be.' lnvolved in
trouble 'which would Involve the United
States.
"In the Interest of peace and justice,"
the President said, ''we yielded to Santo
Domingo's appeal and now are assist
ing her to work- out . her financial
troubles without being made the victim
of force," \u0084 . . . . \u25a0 i ..; \u25a0
\u25a0 Continuing, the President said; '
"Another question of which I wish to
speak is that of a closer supervision by
the Government of great industrial com
binations. I think: it has ' been *a- great
mistake to, act on the the6ry,.whlcb;has

Higglns :' has â¢ notified District- Attorney
Jerome that he could, rely upon executive
co-operation in any action he might take
as the result of ; Superintendent Hend
ricks' preliminary report on the affairs of
the Equitable Assurance Society.
If any crime has been committed by anybody
that situation is manifestly for the District
Attorney. .
There are -certain â¢ other matters of Impor
tance which I am studying, but to which |it
would be premature to refer in detail. â¢ 'â¢'. .â¢
It might be, for instance, to the interest. of
the policy holders .to learn thÂ« character of
and the occasion for some of the legal services
paid for during- the "past few years. But, above
all .Inquiries as to alleged delinquencies, the
greatest necessity of the situation . is that the
rights of the ipdicKr holders "in all.' respects be
ascertained as dearly and as 'completely, and
as quickly as is legally possible. In this and
in other particulars I shall try my best to , ob
tain results. : \u25a0 . i .

waste or misapplication of funds for any rea
eon or by anybody. \u25a0 - â¢ . â¢; . - t

August Belmont has tendered his resig
nation as director of the Equitable So
ciety, to take effect if the trustees ac
cept It. They have not yet done so, al
though it was tendered several days ago.
Attorney General Julius M. Mayer ar
rfved here from Wasl/.ngton to-night, and
will remain in town several days investi
gating Equitable affaire. In an interview
to-night, iuayer said:
It is manifest that the people throughout the
whole country are profoundly interested In the
affairs of the Equitable Life Assurance Society.
Therefore, I think it fitting to say that appro
priate steps will be speedily taken by me.
First â To accomplish the return to the Equi
table of any profits wrongfully made or re
tained by reason of trust relations or other
wise. ' \u25a0
Chairman Morton <tf the Equitable So
ciety to-day declined to comment on the
Ht-ndrlcks report, saying that he had
not yet digested It. He eald he had not
accepted any " more resignations. From
Br, authoritative source it was learned
that Morton- is now devoting himself
largely to the work of reorganizing .the
beard of directors. . .T. T â¢
Attention; was directed to-day to the
fact that f oar of the Equitable officers
mentioned In the report of State Super
intendent ' 'of Insurance llendrlcks a*
drawing naiurlcs for the lust flve rears
are- no longer actively .â¢ connected with
the company. E. W. Lambert appear*
in. the report mm a medical director,
with a ftalary of 925,000 a year. - He
died thirteen month* ago, and yet, ac
cording to the table, his salary was
paid thlÂ« year' and last year. Edward
Curtis, who figures as a medical direc
tor at f 15,000 a year, resigned that po
sition eighteen months ago. George H.
Squire, who is now a director of the
company, Is down on the list as finan
cial manager at f 12,000 a year, although
11. â¢H. AVlnthrop succeeded Squire aa
financial manager - many months ago.
J. 11. I.iiHuk lÂ» recorded us a registrar
with v salary of 93500 a year. Lorlng
ceased to perform the active duties, of
the rcglstrurshlp In April, 1903.
Officers of the society to-day said that
possibly Hendrlcks had got hold of an
old list. .'-
NEW YORK, June 22.â District Attor
ney Jerome of New York County v has
entered into "- an~ investigation of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society trouble
and to-day telegraphed to State Super
intendent of Insurance .'Hendricks "asking
him to forward at once official copies, of
his report. It .was later announced that
a .copy had been forwarded.
KEW YORK. June 22. â After a two
days' sojourn in Massachusetts, Presi
dent Roosevelt to-night left Jersey City
at 8:16 o'clock for Washington. The
President* train arrived at the Mott
Haven yards of the New York. New
Haven and Hartford Railroad at 6:4S
and was switched to the transfer boat
Maryland, which started a few minutes
later lor Jersey City. At Jersey City
a crowd cheered the chief magistrate
and he bowed bis acknowledgments as
the train pulled out for tne national
capital.
In circumstances most unfavorable
as far as the weather was concerned,
be was accorded throughout the trip
an enthu6iaetic welcome in all cities
and towns he visited in Massachusetts
and Connecticut. He was accorded dis
tinguished honors and given evidence
of regard by large educational Institu
tions.
Despite the tremendous electrical
storm which swept over Massachusetts
end Connecticut, this afternoon, the
President's Journey from Williams
town to Jersey City was a prolonged
ovation. After leaving Willis mstown
the special train stopped at North
\u25a0Adam 6. Adams, Pittsneld. Brookfleld
Junction, Danbury and South Norfolk.
The crowds assembled at these places
aggregated many thousands, those at
North Adams, Plttefteld and Danbury
being notably large. . At North Adams, |
the home of Congressman Lawrence, <
the President left the train for a few <
minutes and addressed a great crowd j
of people from a stand erected near the |
station. He was introduced by the
Mnvor of the city and addressed him
self particularly to the children. The
echools had been dismissed and all the
factories of the city had shut down in
order that all citizens might Join in
the welcome to the President. Senat6r
Crane of Massachusetts and 'Represen
tative Lawrence left the train at Pitts
fleld. the. President being joined there
by President Mellen of the New York,
New Haven and Hartford Railroad, who
accompanied him as far as Danbury.
What constituted a picturesque fea
ture of all the greetings extended the
President during to-day was the total
disregard' of the throngs of people for
the heavily falling rain, and hundreds
were drenched as they listened to the
President s^eak.
The President's train is scheduled to
reach the national capital at 2 a. m.
The President expects on arrival in
Washington to go directly to the
White House. During the past two
days President Roosevelt "has been free
temporarily from the cares of state.
When he left Washington he gave into
the keeping of Secretary Hay the ne
gotiations for peace in the Far East
during his absence. Since he left the
White House he ha 6 received no news
of Importance bearing upon the pend
ing negotiations.
"I am going to illustrate what I mean
by some work now. being done in the
Department of Jutsice and in the Bureau
of Corporations, at the head of which
| stands your fellow alumnus, James R.
I Garfleld. Resolutions have been passed
!by very Important bodies demanding
the investigation of what is called the
I beef trust' and of the Standard Oil
Company. The beef trust had to be in
vestigated partly by the Department of
fact of the case, and the district At
torney of Chicago. The Commissioner
of Corporations was to report upon the
fact of the case, and the District at
torney was to act on the legal evidence
he could obtain. If the District Attor
ney can collect legal evidence which
will show that there had been willful
and intentional violation of the law by
any man, no matter how high he stands
socially and financially, he will be in
dicted and if possible convicted. If he
does not secure such legal evidence no
amount of popular feeling is to-be al
lowed to be substituted- for the legal'
evidence. So in investigating the beef
trust and .he Standard Oil Company I
have been content to leave it absolutely
in the hands of Mr. Garfleld, because I
know that he was as incapable of being
swayed by popular demand on the one
hand as by any sympathy on the other.
The same spirit must be shown' in ap
plying the laws dealing with all cor
porations, iÂ£ fisf'.l* hope, we get the scope
of those -laws -sufficiently enlarged."
NOKI'H ADAMS, Mass., June 22.â
"The -President's train arrived here dur
ing a rainstorm. The President spoke
from the rear platform of his car for
about five minutes. He said in part:
"I admire a" great many of Massa
chusetts products, but I think the pro
fluct_:of the children is the best. . And
now just a word to you, the fathers
and - mothers and the teachers, as to
.these same children:,, t You..oftenj see
the man who says: 'I have 'had to' work
hard myself and my .child" shall not.'
Xow that father and mother think that
they are being kind to the child. . They
are not. That sort of kindness is a
curse."
When the President's train pulled
into 'Adams several thousand people
had gathered at the station. President
Roosevelt was presented and spoke
briefly. His address was along the
same line as ;his talk at North Adams.
When he had .finished he was presented
with a bouquet by an aged citizen.
PITTSFIELD, Mass., June 22. â Presi
dent Roosevelt arrived here at 2:48 this
afternoon. He was greeted at the rail
road station by a crowd of several
thousand people. He spoke briefly of
the need of ;the proper kind of educa
tion for the children- of to-day in order
to make them good . citizens In the
future, and in conclusion said:
â¢ "For weal or for woe and.' whether
we like it or not, we are a great people.
\V<e have taken our position among the
great peoples of the.earth. .: '.We. cannot
decide \u25a0whether, or not we are to. play a
great part. Providence has- decided
that for us. .All we can decide .' is
whether we will play it well ( or badly
and I know my -countrymen/too well
to-'doubt what their decision will be."
NEW MILFORD, Conn., June 22. â The
special train bearing President Roose
velt reached here at 4:40 o'clock this
afternoon. The President appeared on
tMb rear platform and after shaking
hands with the people assembled made
a short address. Ho spoke of the neces
sity of having a strong navy and said
that while a strong piower should not
imppÃe upon a weaker one,/in turn it
should^iot be imposed upon.
Former Comptroller Nicholas Staub
called for three cheers for the Presi
dent, which were given with a wi11.."-.-
A 8 the train moved away the Presi
dent waved ; his hand, saying: "Good
by,' my friends, arid good luck to you."
and State, for the. last thirty years, that
it is possible to turn back the hands of
the clock, to forbid combinations and *o
restore business accordingly to and un
der conditions which have absolutely
passed away. That cannot be done.
What we can have done is to put, an
efficient supervision over the owner of
the combination. I do j not believe that
such supervision can come effectively
through the state, nor that it can ef
fectively come through the municipality,
but ultimately, in the great majority of
cases, to be effective tt must be exer
cised by the National Government. As
the first step I hope to see the passage
of legislation which will give, as an ex
ecutive, not as a judicial, function to the
National Government the supervision of
the railways of the United States which
are engaged in interstate commerce,
with the power,' when a rate is com
plained of as improper and unjust, to
examine that rate, and if they think the
rate should be changed to change % it to
a given rate, and to have that given rate
take practically immediate effect. It
can only come if the officers intrusted
with the administration of the law re
member that it is exactly as much their
duty to protect the railroad from the
public as to protect the public from the
railroad.

PORTLAND. June 22,-^alifornia; with
her loyal representatives.' original meth
ods of exhibition and - her . extraordinary
reputation, is making quite a hit 'at the
Lewis and Clark exposition. In fact, it is
qnlte a fad here to S visit the California
building to see and hear '"the. latest," so
strong is the prevalent | idea regarding
the State's /unlimited resources.
The California building, placed between
the Forestry and Washington buildings,
built in ; fhe old mission .style, is the
largest State building at the fair. It Is
built in the general outline of a cross
with four entrances. There is a red tiled
roof and large mission doors are heavy
here and there. The doors are heavy
wooden panels with big rusty locks, all so
real in their Imitation that one hearing
the sweet chimes played during. the day
would almost wait . to see .the dark
gowned monks lift the latch and file out
slowly.
On the steps leading to each entrance
are potted, orange trees bearing real fruit
that in a way prepares the visitor for the
sight that confronts him within. Each
side of tHe structure is given over to a
separate section of the State. The shelves
contain fine specimens of fruits and veg
etables. Flanking the center- piece and
keeping the "cross" outline" are, some
"twelve or fourteen square pillars support
ing the balcony. Most of these pillars are
shelved with various sized bottles of
wines, mineral waters and olive oil. The
four front columns are cased in glass and
filled with nuts, acting as outposts for
the enormous walnut elephant which
flaunts its trunk high in greeting to all
who pass that way., Directly behind this
monster is the . ten-foot production ot
the State Capitol, done in papier rnache
and covered with every kind of nuts. Sur
rounding It are, miniature trees, shrub
berry, etc., to represent the -Capitol
grounds. *
Guarding the Capitol is the much' talked
of prune bear. Sitting upright on; Its
haunches, a graphaptiatfie protruding
U ota its grinning jaws, Uie old bear is
dtoing well its share in drawing the
crowd. Other things of general interest
are the great seal of the State, done in
a dozen different kinds of brown beans;
the life-size brown bean elk. and the
pyramid of flowers preserved in the nat
ural colors. Near the front entrance is a
San Diego exhibit, consisting of $50,003
worth of cut and uncut gems. ' ,
Still further displaying the State's
mineral wealth Is a wall of specimens
from mines from all sections of the State.*
Sacramento County has a very clever
reproduction of a hop farm, buildings
and grounds. , ,-
Other exhibits are agricultural.- con-,
sisting of grains, ' "grasses and g specimens >
of soil; fisheries and, forestry, ; which In
clude 'finely mounted specimens " of fish
and birds, and highly polished natural
woods. The. balcony "of 'the building is a.
museum containing an unusually complete
educational exhibit from every count>;;ln
the State, models from: the Lick School,
pictures of the University of California,
paintings and silk exhibits. Upstairs also
are the - private apartments of the com
missioners and their families. -
The Sacramento , Valley, in general, has
specialized Its exhibits, which are mostly
fresh and ' dried fruits," preserved fruits
and vegetables. Long tables are kept con
stantly supplied with the finest fresh
fruit; there are jars and jars of mam
moth fruits in fluids," and a" whole wall Is
laid solid In cases of dried fruias. That
this valley and all the others of the State
are combining jto make ( a splendid : sum
total Is well attested by the .'.following
taken from the Sunday Oregonlan
"With characteristic energy and pro
gress California has come to"* the Lewis
and Clark fair with one of the most com
plete State exhibits ever assembled ;* at
any exposition in the United States. Not
only are all parts of the. State and | her
resources exceptionally.\well represented,
but the building and installations g are
equal to any.' on the ' grounds/ California
may weir be proud of her display, for it
is a glowing tribute to her wealth and
resources and at the same time an expo
sition of her energy and desire, to be
second to 'none on the grounds."

searchers decided that he had 'found the
spring, and imbibed too freely r of \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 its

to the ; great salt lake that lies south
west of Signal Mountain. U.Here It was
found- he had gone into the ; salt water
for some distance and came out and went
around the west end toward the moun
tains. Fifteen t miles from the lake and
within 200 feet of a spring of water they
found Stewart dead. - \u0084

to flna Stewart waiting for him, -but, did
not. He searched for him as long as he
dared, and then took to v the , trail. ; His
sufferings due to lack of water made him
unconscious, and he was only aroused

Deceased lived with his mother and

Witzemann. at $43 Stelner 6treet. A
brother. Nicholas, also survives him.
William was studying at the affiliated
colleges for the medical profession, and
had but three months more to go before
completing hia term, when it was his in
tention to take another course in the
University of California at-Berkeley. He
was 22 years of age, and a native of San
Francisco.
Another cad case of drowning was
Added to the list of such accidents yes
terday xnornins: when William Henry
Witzemann. a stalwart and handsome
young medical student, was suddenly lost
while In bathing with two companions at
the beach at Oceanside, formerly known
Â«Â£ "Carville."
* It had been Witzemann's custom for
some time to^ro in company with Chris.
M. Christoffer of 62S Stanyan street for
a swim. Yesterday morning the young
man called for his companion, and the
pair disrobed In a car which they used
as a dressing: room, and together, with
another young man named William
Jones, went into the water. While the
eea was not what might be called very
rough, the breakers were particularly
strong and dashed the bathers about, and
when even in shallow water it was as
much &s they could do to keep their feet.
Christoffer's wife was seated on the
beach watching her husband and friends,
as she did almost every morning, and
fearing for the safety of Christoffer and
Jones, both of whom were much farther
out than Witzemann, waved her hands
warnlngly. Jonee. it eeems, was In ac
tual trouble, and Chrlstoffer swam to his
assistance and brought him ashore, but
on looking around for Witzemann, they
discovered that he had disappeared. The
life-savers made a search, but the body
was not recovered.

GETS MONEY ON BOGUS CHECKS.
HAY WARDS, June 22. â Representing
himself as the business manager of the
Pacific States Telephone Company, a
man giving the name' of James S. Long
succeeded in getting $15 on worthless
checks yesterday from the proprietor
of the Azores Hotel and Mrs. L. S.
Frakes, the owner of a restaurant on
Castro street. The swindler in each
case told his victims that he wanted
accommodations for a crew of linemen,
and as the telephone company now has
a.' large crew at work rebuilding the
Hay wards exchange, no suspicion, was
aroused when he presented checks for
the payment of a week's board for the
men in advance. At .the Azores Hotel
he presented a check for $31. receiving
511 in change, and at the restaurant of
Mr*. Frakes he offered a check for $30,
drawn on the California Bank of San
Francisco, receiving $4 in change.,.,.
When the linemen failed to appear
at the appointed time the victims be

Miss Barrows' production of "AJax," the
Greek play, in the Greek theater on the
university campus was a notable event in
the university's history. She: has now
given up plans for a brilliant academic
and dramatic career to become the/ bride
of Mr.' Mussey, himself a distinguished
scholar, resident in New York.
Miss Barrows occupies- a unique posi
tion in the world of letters, and espe
cially because 'she alone, among women
has attempted the revival of the ancient
Greek drama, with such accessories as
are appropriate and using the language
spolvin by the Greeks; who first heard the
lines of "Ajax" and other Grecian dramas
centuries ago. "Miss Barrows is herself a
Greek scholar, and with ft dramatic in
stinct and love of dramatic presentations
of the classical .sort that made . her at
tempts to revive the , old . Greek dramas
markedly successful.'/ '- ! '
At the University of California she co
operated with the Greek department and
others who love the classical drama in
producing VAjax," and' with the Greek'
theater as the scene"of the Undertaking,
university students and professors in the
principal and lesser parts, and a great
throng of literary folk. \in the amphithe

. OAKLAND. June 22.â Daniel W. Doody
will not take the position of Assistant
City Clerk, which was created for him
by the votes of six members of the City
Council. Doody has decided that there
has been too much publicity given the
efforts of his f. -lends to provide him with
a job after he was retired from the sec
retaryship of the Board of Health.
It has been announced by Doody's ad
visers, and sponsors in the City Council
that his resignation will be forthcoming
before, the next meeting, with a state
ment of his attitude toward the subjectl
Although the appointment was made
Monday night, Doody has not appeared
at. the. City Hall to assume the duties
of the place. These were outlined in the
resolution naming him as bearing upon
the work of the Street Committee. The
new assistant clerk \u25a0 was to investigate
pctitio'ns, protests and other communica
tiehs from property owners touching
street, work.
Councilman W. J. Baccus, who engi
neered the project of providing Doody
with a berth at the City Hall, has been
quoted as authority for the declaration
that the withdrawal will be made. It
Is hinted at the Cltv Hall that a
strong . public opinion against the action
of the majority of the Council has led to
this "move to close an incident in Oakland

CHANGE IN PORTLAND SERVICE.
Attorney General /Webb has decided
that - the new Judges of the Courts of
Appeal are ' not entitled to an annual
salary/- of ' $8000 as ' they claimed:: .The
opinion also affects the recently appoint
ed Superior Judges, who will have to be
content' with the old salaries. The Leg
islature provided â¢ for an increase of $2000
a yearfor Justices of the Supreme Court.
It: was /admitted, that > the incumbents
could not : get the advance in ; pay as
the law : provided : that . the salary, of mo
official may be ! increased while he ; is in
office. >~> When a Justice or his successor
Is ; elected $8000 a year instead of; $6000
will be his salary. .
It is provided in the law that the Judges
of the -District Courts of Appeal; shall
receive a salary equal to ' tnat of the Jus
tices t of . the Supreme â¢ Court, i The ' new
members of the inferior E tribunal - held
that they should be entitled to draw
$8000 a ; year to begin with. Their salary
demands were presented ; to "Controller
Colgan, who asked: for Information, on
the subject from 'the Attorney General's
office. '
General Webb holds that the Judges,
while not appointed until May 18, actually
held office from -April - 10. They; can
therefore collect their salaries ' for the
extra five weeks during which * they did
no work, but only- at the rate of $6000
ayear." But'as it is held that they took
office before', the Increase of" salaries
went into effect they must work at the
old "rate of pay until ' re-elected. The new
Superior Judges of Los Angeles County
must also. labor for the salary given un
der the old law. \u25a0 .
.'When the terms of office of Justices
Henshaw and Lorigan and of some of the
Appellate Court Judges shall have ex
pired in January, 1907, they or their suc
cessors will collect $2000 more annually
than Chief Justice Beatty of the Supreme
Court -
: Whenxthe news of the ruling was spread

circles was poignant.

large wad of human hair which she
averred had been plucked from her scalp
by Pasquale Leon, an aged Frenchman
who owns the house she occupies, and
assailed her because ahe declined to va
cate It. The Judge closely examined the
exhibit and then requested Mrs. . West
to show him the spot from which it had
been uprooted, but no baldness could she
display.
"It looks like combings,** said his Hon
or, gingerly fingering the â¢ fluff y man.
â¢ "It ain't no combings," Mrs., West de
clared, "it was yanked from â¢ my head
by Mr. Leon. If he pays my $40 doctor's
bill I'll call it square." _ .
."I don't believe the hair was plucked

Patrolman J. Clancy saw "Kid Nash,"
of bunko fame, tenderly leading an in
toxicated man at Mission and Lafayette
streets, and ,as the "Kid" had been or
dered by Judge Mogan to leave San
Francisco and never return, he was
promptly arrested and his drunken
companion permitted to take care of
himself. At ' the Central station the
prisoner declared his name was Joseph
Massey. but Clancy was 1 so sure of his
man that Judge Mogan gave him until
to-morrow to bring additional identifi
cation testimony.
"Kid Nash" was arrested several
times on complaint of Rose Decker, a
woman of the tenderloin, whom he had
beaten, and he was finally ordered to
leave town.
"How could he be that," was the re
ply, "whe,n he is charged with using
scurrilous language? He isn't deaf,
and I've heard â¢him speak. The lady
told me that he visited the parish
house and said he wanted to see a cer
tain priest, whom he named, and when
she informed him that the clergyman
was absent he called her a liar and
other uncomplimentary names."
"I don't doubt your word, officer,"
said the Judge, "but I can't convict a
man without giving him opportunity
to put in a defense."
Then a messenger was dispatched
for Police Sergeant Green, who has
the mute language literally at his
fingers' ends, and during the wait his
Honor wrote, "Are you deaf and
dumb?" on a piece of paper and handed
it to the defendant, who still seemed
be oblivious to all sound. The answer
was a headshake and the marking of
a cross on the paper, the symbol ap
parently being intended as a confession
of inability to read. The betting at
the attorneys* table, which had opened
at 2 to 1 odds that Mr. O'Connor was
playing dummy, abruptly switched to
8 to 7 that he was a victim of mistaken
identity on the part of Patrolman Mc-
Namara, who glared as if fascinated at
the defendant.
Then came Sergeant Green, and he
exhausted his entire digital repertoire
without bringing the slightest re
sponse. "If he's a mute," said the ser->
geant. "his education has been woefully
neglected."
"I have never doubted he was sham
ming," said the Judge, "but he was
entitled to a chance to plead and I gave
it to him. Now I give him three
months' imprisonment.", f
"He's a hâlh â 1 of a Judge," Mr. O'Con
nor huskily murmured to Bailiff Con
Donahue as that trustworthy offlcer
escorted him back to. the cage.,
"What's the matter with him?" his
Honor inquired, glancing at the officer.'
"Is he a deaf mute?"
HALSEY'S TESTIMONY IS
CONCLUDED AT ST. FRANCIS
Excellent dairies In San Mateo County are:
Cnritten's Dairy, the Martn Dairy or L. Spanl
and the Portland Dairy, owned by Mrs. Em
hoft. There were twelve San Francisco dairies
inspected and a vast improvement was not-d.
Jurt one year aco these dairies were rated
â¢"CUhy," but they are now in excellent con
dition and the quality of milk has Improved.
Only two email dairies, one owned by T.
Becozn and the other by T. Minehan, were
found to be In a condition that needed remedy-
Ing. The larger dairies, such as the Del
M'.nte. Liberty, California, Green Valley.
Golden Eagle and Sunnyslde Farm were found
in an excellent condition. It Is the Intention
of the Health ' Officer to summon before the
Board of Health the dairymen from cutslde
< cur.tic? who do not comply with the San
Knncisco milk regulations to show cause why
the permits of those who deliver milk in San
Francisco should not be revoked.
Health Offlcer Ragan and Chief In
specting Physician Hassler went on a
tour of dairy inspection at 5 o'clock
Wednesday morning. The dairies owned
by Gioldi and Christian and Witt
Brothers near Colm'a were found in an
extremely dirty condition, according to
the report of thÂ« officials filed yester-.
day with the Health Board. The own
ers were given the alternative of com
pleting the requirements of the health
department in three weeks or having
their milk Quarantined and prohibited
from being delivered In San Francisco.
The report continues:
The Six-Mile Dairy, owned by Joseph Furrer,
situated 13 the same county, was also found
unsatisfactory and In the dairy herd were found
two diseased cows. These cows were quaran
tined and specific Instructions civen to thÂ»
owntra to clean up within three weeks cr nai-e
their milk placed under ths ban of the de
partment. The San Hateo Dairy, owned by
John D. Daly, was tound fairly clean; th*
barn needs better lighting and ventilation and
the milk and can rooms are eijxjs.d to the
air from the barn, contrary to the rules of this
department. These cca^ltlons were ordered
remedied in order that^nilk from this dairy
be allowed to reach Ban Francisco. An
other bad dairy was the Cclrr.a Dairy, owned
by V. Miller. The premises and. structures
were filthy and a general clean up was or
dered.

dropped a $10 goldpiece on the floor,
whereupon, he swore, Mr. . Keehoe
picked up the. coin and concealed it < on
his person. Mr. Keehoe, indignantly
denied that he purloined the golden
disc, but acknowledged having lifted
from the floor a silver dollar which he
had dropped. Mr.â Weida then under
took to search the suspect, but by
standers interfered and saved Mr. Kee
hoe from that great humiliation, jj so
Mr. -Welda summoned a policeman and
turned Mr. Keehoe into custq_dy. - .
"You have not proved that the de
fendant took your money," said the
Judge to the complainant, "and the
court is in doubt as to whether he did
take it."
"But doubt," declared Mr. Welda, in
a "curse-the-luck" tone, "does n6t re
store me gold." .
"Nay," acquiesced the bench, "but It
restores the defendant to freedom.
Case dismissed." -
As the post-meridian fog: glooms San
Francisco's face so did disappointment
cloud Mr. Welda's classic features., Mr.
Keehoe's chubby countenance radiated
Joy.

and who earns STÂ» a moats as the

says the Chicago later Oceaa. His
name Is Joha K. McKeough. He Is
oSee boy at the Board of Education.
He is 19 years old aad began working
five years ago at 14 a week.
~Joha Is the boy who has never

the board." said Superintendent of
Schools EL G. Cooley. â¢ "I never â¢ have
known him to do anything that was
not done just rlgbt. The nnaace com

exists it would be like hunting for a
needle ia a. haystack to find him. He
walked !a here Quietly f.v* years ago.
He was never ia the way. but if any
thing was wanted be knew where to
lay his hand oa it. Then the finance
committee raised his salary because. he
was worth.it- John Is ready to work
nights and holidays.
"A great many requisitions are han
dled up here. It wasn't John's work to
look after ;i.Â«m, but he sooa became so
proficient that <it became part of bis
-work to assist with that kiad of work.
He learned to use the typewriter. The

HERETOFORE all of the interest in the moisture of the State
and its conservation ha* been put upon the surface waters.
This is natural and proper, -since we all are concerned in
what is visible or palpable. The number of suits in our courts of
first instance over the right to ground water that is not seen uatil
it is tapped bring into focus the conservation of the artesian and
other ground waters of the State.
This subject is of interest to the powerful- Waters and Forests
Society, since it has to do with moisture below the surface as well
as above. Whea the first convention to consider water was held
in this city, out of which came the Waters and Forests. Society,
much discussion was had over the surface water and impounding
it in reservoirs. Mr. Schussler, the eminent hydraulic engineer,
suggested the importance of the underground reservoirs, provided
by nature, and incidentally the feasibility of storingjvater in the
soil to be brought into use by capillary attraction, ibmce then the
ground waters, artesian and other, have advancea to a position of
drst importance in our rural economy.
There is z vast artesian belt lying across the San Joaquin YaK
ley. It is obviously replenished from the surface, as it pulsates in
the level of its water table with the series of wet and dry seasons.
The surface above this belt varies in altitude, and where it , is
tapped on low ground the flow has a tendency to lower the table
on higher ground. Its store is exhausted by hundreds of flowing
-.ye*"= that were bored on land made impossible of cultivation by
alkali. By a strange freak these wells that are useless are usually
the strongest in then" 6ow. Many of the wells, scores of them, on
good izrA do not Sow at all, as a result of this wasteful depletion
of the supply- For several years, as a result of good wells on bad
lard and non-Sowing wells on good land, the artesian belt has not
made a good report- Pumping the non-Sowing wells on good land
was made impossible by the high cost of steam- power, the salary
of an engineer and other expenses. The discover}- of fuel oil and
the use of its by-products have changed all this, and pumping plants
are now numerous in the artesian belt, and it is coming into use,
to make a valuable addition to the productive resources cf the
State. ,
The lands n;oistened by pumping the ground waters are desert j
rntil irrigated, but the\- axe naturally fertile and enjoy all the ad- j
vantages of our climate and variety of capacities, j Xo statistics of
ground water irrigation are available, but from observation and the
records of tbe gas engine and centrifugal pump houses it is evident
that pump irrigation is already close 'up to the surface water method.
But the waste of ground water goes on unchecked. Useless -.veils I
are Sowing on abandoned alkali land, and only the â¢mosquitoes and
nrad hens get benefit from the waste. Observations covering four !
or Sve years seem to demonstrate that the store of ground water, i
replenished as it is from the precipitation on the high mountains, is \u25a0
feufneient to irrigate all of the fertile land that lies over the artesian
belt that has no other means of irrigation, provided the waste of
water through useless Sowing wells is restrained. Under such cir
cumstances the conservation of ground water equals in importance ;
the guarding of the surface supply.
As we have suggested, the litigation in the courts is one cvi- j
der.ee cf the importance attached to this subject by irrigators and
land owners. The Supreme Court has decided many intricate issues
involved in the subject, but we recall none covering the point oi !
water waste through wells abandoned by their owners, or permitted
to fiow without any use being made of the water in the irrigation ;
of alfalfa or any other kind of crop.
The west side of the San Joaquin Valley is greatly interested
in this matter, because south of a lice drawn east and west through
Fresno :t has no other than artesian water for irrigation. Many
collateral industries are also interested. Pump irrigation brings
trade to the engine and pump manufacturers and pays wages to
their emr-ioves. It furnishes an increasing use for our fuel oil and
its products, which is very desirable to the owners of oil property.
Its results, in the production of crops, Lring families to settle on
the desert and contribute tonnage to the railroads. All depend
upon conservation of the ground waters, and united they should
be strong enough to induce the Waters and Forests Society to write
this among the objects of its concern, to the end that some plan
may be four I to stop the waste. The Call will be glad to receive
facts and statistics which disclose the extent of pump irrigation by
the use of ground waters, and the- bearing of waste upon that
interest. *

Secret of Their Bliss

T"*HE great strike in Chicago seems to be ending, fubhc opinion
I c:d not consider the cause for it to be reasonable. It involved j
* no question of wages or hours xjf labor, but was begun and J
continued for the purpose of compelling employers to quit dealing]
or haying business relations with such firms as their employes chose
to dictate to them to outlaw. Of course this dictation cannot be
tolerated any more than like dictation to the employe by the em
ployer can be tolerated.
" The aftermath of the strike includes revelations of the use of
the power of labor unions by their leaders, for base hire, to injure
the business rjvals of certain firms. The Grand Jury has this in
hand and the guilty parties will no doubt be punished.
Primarily Mr. Shea was responsible for the strike arid for its.
continuance after public sentiment had repudiated it and many labor
unions had withdrawn frdm it their sympathy and support. Mr.
Shea cannot escape moral responsibility for the twenty murders
and the innumerable injuries and disorders that make up the bloody
record of his error in judgment. It is vain for him to plead that
these base and brutal crimes were committed not by the strikers
but by their sympathizers. Level-headed union men do not relish
being' put in the position of having the sympathy only of mur
derers, thugs and rioters.
In this country a cause that has such allies can never win, and
it is time that leaders like Mr. Shea found this out. They seem to
be led astray by the sense of power and by the too trusting obedience
of the members of the organizations they control. The mass of
union men will soon, under these circumstances, begin to exercise
the right of private judgment as to the wisdom of the measures they
are ordered to teke, and then there will be an end of unwise leader
ship and a limitation upon the number of strikes.' "; Shattered Vnervee,** weak stomach,"^ :m-.

The police started on a hunt for the
caring- hiphwayman, but as they have
no clew his chances of escape are very
bright.
The highwayman grabbed the purse and
acain cautioned the woman against mak
ing an outcry. Believing she would not
act on his advice the felio-w emphasized
t:s command by clutching the helpless
woman by the throat and choking her
nearly Into Insensibility. He then Jumped
on his wheel and rode rapidly along
Frar.klin street.
"Hand over your puree or I'll blow
your brains out." commanded the footpad
In a calm voice. Seeing that resistance
was useless Mrs. Allen handed the man
her purse, containing $7 and several keys
and trinkets.
A daring highwayman alighted from a
bicycle and held up and robbed Mrs. H.
Ailea l&yt night at Franklin and Pine
blreets. After choking: his victim till she
was nearly insensible the man jumped
on his wheel and rode rapidly away.
Mrs. Allen hurried to the North End
police station as soon as she had col-
It cted her scattered senses and made a
r*-port of the robbery.
Mrs. Allen resides at the corner of
Bush and Franklin streets and was on
hfi way home about 10:30 o'clock after
vit-iUng a friend. She had just passed
the corner of Pine street when she was
frtized from behind. On turning around
Mrs. Allen was confronted by a gruff- i
leoklng man at whose feet rested a
b:cyde.

NOT TO MAKE NOISE
The remaining two weeks of the Rob
erts season will be devoted to revivals
of her two greatest triumphs. "Tess of
the d'Urbervilles" and "Zaza."
Florence Roberts has no better medium
through which to demonstrate her talent
than In the soul-stirring German play,
"MagJa," which was presented for ihe
nrst time this season at the California
last night. From the moment the shape
ly actri^s appeared fresh from her tri
umphs oi the festival until she sank in
horror and despair before the spectacle
of a dying father, she held her audience
spellbound. At times her hearers roused
themselves from their tense interest
enough to grant htr vigorous applause,
but for the most part the house was as
quiet as the rrave .Â«ave for the people
of the stage. Miss Roberts is wonderful
in many Dlavs, but in "none more so than
in "Magda."
William Yerrance in the part of the tot
terinff father portrayed the â¢ rigid dis
ciplinarian to the letter. . His work was
above reproach and received much justly
merited applau.Â«e. Lucius Henderson as
the pastor was very convincing. His
beatitlc countenance and gentle manner
would remind any one of a bishop. Her
schel Mayall played the part of the hypo
critical Dr. yon Keller in an excellent
manner. The audience started to hiss
him once for his villainy as other audi
ences used to hiss his opponents at the
Central. The others of the cast furnished
admirable support.
The special season thus far has been so
profitable that Miss Roberts at the Cali
fornia has decided to. add two more weeks
to *.h<? original engagement of six weeks,
which will bring the close of her engage
ment up to the middle of July.
On Sunday night and all of next week,
with the exception of the. Wednesday
matinee, Miss Roberts will be seen in her
most brilliant emotional success, "Ca
mUle." At the Wednesday matinee she
will give one special performance of Ib
sen's fascinating psychic Btory. "A Doll's
House," which will be of special interest
from the fact that it will be the first
Sail Francisco appearance of Miss Rob
erta In the leading role of Nora. She will
be supported by Hergchell Mayall as
Krogstad; Lucius : Henderson as Dr.
Rank; William Yerrance as Thorwald
Helmer: Louise Royce as Mrs. Linden,
and others.
The audience was large and moved. to
easy mirth throughout the play. It runs
until Saturday night only. T. Daniel
Frawley in "Ranson's Fol:y" comes on
Monday evening:.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
If only to hear Nat Goodwin say: "Oh,
yes, I know the value of money," as he
tells In the play how for want of It his
mother died, "A Gilded Fool" is worth
while. It is an exquisitely handled bit
of pathos, exquisite In restraint, ex
quisite in truth. Then after it Mr. Good
win has the audience choking again over
ttiv awkward sweetness and' simplicities
of his Chauncey Short. He runs the
most attractive gamut of his art in this
play and last night was in finest fettle.
One realized anew what a difficult person
he Is to play with. Even Miss Ruth
Mackayâ and Miss Mackay is an ad
mirably human creatureâ appears slightly
artificial In Mr. Goodwin's trying en
vironment. These are the actor's last
appearances in the comedy and those de
sirous of retaining the memory of Good
win In one of the best of the genial,
lovable, awkward, sterling characters he
best affects ! should see him here.
Miss Mackay has little to do, but does
that little with charm and distinction In
the part of Margaret Ruihren. Miss
Flora Parker has the role of Nell Ruth :
ren and is quite piquant In a rather
mannered fashion therein. But why does
Miss Ruthren's stage manager permit her
to make love to her audience, to wile,
scold and tease them instead of the stage
fclk? He shouldn't. Georgie Mendum
Is again clever, if a little montonously so,
in the role of the old maid.
Ellle Norwood is a villain of not too
painful sort as Banister Strange. He
is sincere and convincing. Best of the
men outside of Mr. Goodwin is, however,
Neil O'Brien, who Is all but as ' good as
Goodwin as the valet. Laughter well
earned falls also to a capital bit of ec
ctntric comedy contributed by W. H.
Post, and Norman Tharp is boyish and
sincere as Duval.

embers of Union League
Spend Pleasant Evening
at Festal Board.
At the Union League Club v last night
about 150 members gathered at an Infor
mal dinner in the banquet hall. An elab
orate dinner was served and good fellow
ship reigned throughout the* evening. \u2666
Music, songs and toasts kept those as
sembled in good humor throughout the
evening. It was the first affair, of this
kind given since the club moved into its
new quarters and it was a popular suc
cess. V" / .*"\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 â¢â¢- â¢ ; - \u25a0:-\u25a0\u25a0:\u25a0:.-\u25a0

Colonel George H. Plppy, president of
the club, was toastmaster. Uncle George
Bromley was there as witty as ever, and
he could : not escape without making a
little talk. In a speech sprinkled with
humor he kept the crowd In good cheer.
General C. A. Woodruff delivered a
speech appropriate to the ocpaslon. After
the dinner the members spent ,the re

n The International -Printing Pressmen
and Assistants* Union met. in conven
tion" yesterday morning. ;' The members
spent the afternoon on the bay,'.view
ing, the points of interest adjacent to
San Francisco. In the evening a din
ner was enjoyed %t the ' Russ;House,
where "all the delegates, . their wives
and | families Â§ were , present \u25a0; and p made
merry until; early; morning.' * To-day is
scheduled as .'. the Uast of the}conven
tion, but the unfinished business
the body may necessitate holding a ses*
sion. to-morrow. 1 ; ' : \~ ' , ;vâ^; - :
At the dinner many
guests were' present, including the
Mayor. A simple repast was 'served,
after which the speechmaking began;
Among, the speakers , were ; Mayor
Schmitz, who complimented the organi
zation on its work; President Martin P.
Higgins, who dwelt upon the work of
the convention,, and Toastmaster Jen
nings Phillips, who confined, his -re
marks r to : anti-Japanese legislation.
The i other speakers were \u25a0 Hamilton
Wright of the California Promotion
Committtee, .William J. French of the
San Francisco Labor Council ; : W. Mac
arthur. "The Labor- Movement"; \u25a0 E. J.
Bowles, "The Press"; James H. Barry,
George Norton and Delegate T. F.
Galokowsky. \u25a0 , ; '; -;: ; \u25a0'-'.. ' \u25a0 -_
â¢ In the afternoon the delegates and
their .families were guests of the local
unions on a trip around the bay on the
steamer H. J. Corcoran*. The start was
made from the Clay-street wharf at ; 2
o'clock and the. boat circled the bay
slowly, passing points, of Interest.
During the trip several of the commit
tees were in session, while* the younger
members and ladies of the party were
being entertained by a special /or
chestra. " #
: Yesterday morning < \u25a0 the , delegates
continued the regular sessions "of the j
convention. A question that will be of
great interest in the" near future was
that of the demand for a continuance
of the eight-hour day. The' resolution
passed by the convention asked sup
port for the local unions of San Fran
cisco in their approaching fight against
the return by employers to a nine-hour
day. A section of the_ resolution asked
the presence of " the executive board in
the city to consider the question at
the close of the convention. This re
quest was also granted. .- * /,
Another \u25a0question" that â¢ called forth
debate and occupied much time was
that of abandoning the, present policy
of sending organizers^ through the :
country. , The resolution in relation, to :
the question was framed with the -in- I
; tention of doing away with the special
organizers employed oy the.;interna
tional. The committee on laws reported
unfavorably .-. on it (and for- r a ; time It
looked as If the committee's report
would be overruled and the post of or- !
ganizer abolished. '. : ';^
At the conclusion of a speech in fa
vor of the proposition by -President
Higgins, the committee's report was
sustained and the organizers will be
used during the coming year. !
.Several other, resolutions affecting
the policy of; the various branches of
the international were passed upon.
Principal among them was an addition
to the constitution - requiring that all
organizations, when r applying ; ' for a
charter, shall pay an additional fee of
$10 to the secretary-treasurer, who
shall supply them with a seal, working
cards and stationery. \u25a0 . . .

ProTidcnce has allotted ns' each at

our mission in life, and it is generally
our own fault if we die prematurely.
Nervous exhaustion invites disease.
This statement is the positive truth. *
When everything becomes a burden
and you cannot walk a few blocks with-
out excessive fatigue, and you 'break,
out into perspiration easily, and your
face flushes, and you prow excited and
shaky at the least provocation,' and
you cannot bear to be crossed in any-
thing, you are in danger ; your nerves'
have given out ; you need building up
at once I To build up woman's nerv-
ous system and during the period of.
change of life we know of no better
medicine than Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound. Here is an
illustration. Mrs. Mary L. Eoehne, 371
*Garfield Avenue, Chicago, 111., writes:
g I have used Lydia K. Piakhanfs Vegetable
Compound for years in my famihr and it
never disappoints : so when I felt that I was ,
nearingthechangeof life I commenced treat-
ment with it. I took in all about six bottles
and it did me a great deal of good. It
stopped my dizry spalls, pains in my back
am the headaches with which I had suffered
for months before taking the Compound. I
feel that if it had not been forthis ereatmed-
* icine for women that I Rhonld not have been

Rili Puts an End to a Great Struggle
oÂ» Soldiers' Field In Eleventh
Innlngr.
CAMBRIDGE. Mass., June 22. â A
rainstorm at the end of tbe eleventh
Inning brought to a close, but left un
decided, an Intensely exciting game be
tween Harvard and Yale on Soldiers*
Field this afternoon. The score was
I to 1 when the game was called. At a
meeting of tbe captains nnd coaches of
tbe two teams to-night it was decided
to call off the game played to-day and
to regard the contest which will take
place at New Haven on Tuesday next
as the first of the series. Arrange
ments for the second game will be
made later.
Yale scored an earned run at the
start and In the second Inning Vales'
misplays enabled a Harvard man .to
cross the plate. From that time on
several opportunities were offered by
both sides, but the superb pitching and
sharp fielding prevented further runs.

The magnificent new steam yacht Lur-
Hne. owned by Adolph B. Spreckels. was
successfully launched yesterday after
noon at 5 .o'clock from the ways of the
shipyard of ; John Twigg & Sons. Po
trero.V The launching was attended by
Mr. j Spreckels and a party of - Intimate
friends, and the boat glided off the ways
to the- satisfaction of both her owner
and her ! builder. -
1 The: Lurline is the finest steam yacnt
ever built -on \u25a0 the coast. She is 69
feet . in , length and 12 % feet beam,
drawing 4 feet of [ water. She Is fitted
with a 100-horsepower engine of J the
triple expansion condensing variety. She
will have her own Independent electric
light plant and will carry a 1200
candle-power searchlight. . She is built
to make 12 knots (or 13% miles) an
hour. r ' . ". :
The Lurline will be fittted up " with
antique : mahogany and Â« brass. Jf o ex
pense has ueen spared to make her tha
most elegant craft of her kind ever
seen 'in these waters. Mr. Spreckels
intends to run her, on trlpa to his Napa
'stock-farm.", and as the Napa^Creek is
rather a shallow \ body of water, the
boat is given a", light draught.
._ The ; Lurline [ will : accommodate â¢ about
fifty ; persons, outside of her crew. She
can easily navigate the waters of the
State, and her , owner will be able to
run ' her . wherever he pleases. Her trial
trip will , be ; held ion July 1. The Lur
line was' constructed under the super
vision of Captain Alexander Swansea.

manager for. Marvin Hart, as referee for
the heavy-weight championship battle
which is to ! . take place here on July 3.

as final stakeholder and' a certified; check
for the amount: of the purse of $5000 was
sent him. at San Francisco last night, as
well as Marvin Hart's forfeit, which has
been on deposit in . a , Reno bank. Root's
forfeit was placed Jon deposit with' Cor

cerned not later than .ten days before the
fight. , Harry, Corbett ! now has ,, the $5000

put up by the principals.-; . /
The battle is to be of the finish sort, so
that there can be no draw, the end com
ing only when one of the men wins ' and
the other loses. In the matter of i weight
Hart will have ; considerably " the* best* of
it, but since the* battle 7 is to \u25a0 be contested
under the clean break rules , Root" figures
that his shiftiness : and hi s left hand will
more than offset the disparity In weights."

IfEW TORK. June 22. â Trouble be
tween the Jockey Club stewards and
members of the Metropolitan Turf As
sociation of Bookmakers, which has
been on for several months because the
turf authorities withdrew from the as
pociatlon members their exclusive priv
ileges In the betting ring and compelled
them to buy tickets on entering the
tracks, has come to an end.
Three bookmakers, who for some
time had dominated the association's
affairs and had become Imbued with an
idea that they were in personal control
of the Eastern turf. have been
squelched. One of them ceased to visit
the track. It being reported that he is
111.
Through negotiations carried on by
the fourth member of the association's
governing committee it has been agreed
by the stewards to allow only ten in
dependent books on the inner line of
the betting: ring: and they will be placed
at the end of the horseshoe-shaped en
closure, while the "Mets" will be al
lowed to fill the side lines of the ring:.
In return for these privileges the
bookmakers will contribute -purses to
overnight sweepstakes and will be un
der an expense on this score of about
$6000 dally. It is expected the new
turn In turf affairs will result in a re
duction of admission to the race tracks,
sooner or later, to the old basis of $2.

COUTY LEITRIM SOCIAL
CLUB WILL HOLD PICNIC
City Engineer Woodward ventured
the opinion yesterday that the proposed
Improvement of Union-square avenue,"
between Kearny and Stockton, streets,
by the construction of an arcade there
on could not be legally done.' Wood
ward say 3 that the use of the puMic
streets in the manner proposed is ex
pressly prohibited by, the charter and
ordinances now in effect, passed by thÂ«
Board of- Supervisors.
Woodward believes the improvement
a very desirable one from an esthetic
point of view, but claims that the
Board of Public Works has not thÂ«
power to grant a permit for the carry
ing: out of the project.
"It is surprising to me that the pro
moters of the scheme appear to bÂ«
going: ahead with it ip apparent igno
rance of the law prohibiting the main
tenance of obstructions on the streets,"
said Woodward. "Again, every^archl
tect knows that the njan as outlined
will 'constitute a direct violation of thÂ»
building ordinance and therefore could
not be legally accomplished. A permit
for the scheme could not be granted
by the Board of Works, no more than
permission could be granted to Install
an awning to cover the roadway of
any public thoroughfare. The- law Is
plain on the point and the Merchants*
Association has been vigorous In Â«
acting compliance therewith."

It's nose and nose with the Seals and
the Tigers now and a wink will put a
new leader iri the chase for the baseball
pennant. But It must be the right kind
|of a wink. The Seals have had the right
i dope on the Angels for three days now.
j If fate will remain at the helm for the
balance of the series and do what's
right San Francisco will be a headliner
once again. They waddled in yesterday,
score 4 to 3. f
Doll>>Gray's heave to the first bag in
round number four was the good niglit
high sign of the occasion. Dolly whipped
that ball so strongly and so far that two
runners scored and another trotted to T
third and landed after a brlef^jrest there.
The Angels made a bitl soon after, but
the Seals took a brace before {he score
was quite tied, so the result at the finish
was unchanged.
Each team. had a run when the Seals
came up for toeirs in the fourth. Hilde
brand profited by a base on balls and
Irwiri was walloped in the slats. Nealon
laid down a pretty bunt which Dolly
Gray seized and tried to whip to first.
His wing proved much too strong for the
distance and the ball kept right on to
the bleachers while Irwin and Hildebrand
hesitated not till they reached the pan.
Xealon pulled .up third and Wilson
sent him in with a long fly to Bernard.
The Seals began to get wobbly in the
fourth and it came near oeing evening
for them. -Williams walked. Bernard and
Nealon booted Flood's drive. He tried
to peg to Williams when Dick covered
the bag, but his wing was -.vrong. Wil
liams picked up the ball after a scramble
and pegged to third. The leather again
went astray, letting Bernard in. Flood
pulled up at second and started for home
when Smith dispatched a slzsler at Goch
nauer. Johnny grabbed the leather and
whipped it into first, nailing Smith. Nea
lon returned it to the pan and Wilson
made a stab at Flood as Timothy
sprawled in. Umpire Davis said "safe."
though every fan on the lot swore Flood
was out by at "least one city block.'
. As soon as the Angela went into the
field Mr. 'Dillon paid the umpire a high
compliment by calling him an ordinary
crook. Mr. Darts thought the remark
out of place on a ball field and im
mediately banished Mr. Dillon after as
sessing him five buckÃ. Eager finished
the game at first base. The Angels
seemed to get along all right without
their cap.
Spencer pulled off the spectacular stunt
of the day with two gone in the ninth.
Bernard started one for the " fence" that
had a two-base label on it. Spence
hooked It with one mitt with his back
against the fence. The Seals started
another rally in the eighth when Waldron
and Wheeler bingled. Irwin then hit to
Flood and a double play made a run
impossible.
Uncle figures that Hitt can beat the
Angels again this afternoon, so the bush
southpaw will have to work again. Hen
ley's arm is a bit to the bad, but^ Hank
thinks he ,will be right by ; to-morrow.
The Seals will make a desperate effort
to take the Angels over the route seven
times this series. The score:

The State/ Board of . Harbor Commis
sioners; on motion, of the president,
Charles 11. Spear, âyesterday elected
Henry GlaÃ of Los Angeles to be wharf
inger, at Harrison-street .wharf, to suc
ceed \Thomas F. Casey. , Commissioners
John *D.- ; Mackenzie and , Henry J-
Crocker voted with. the president, mak
ing the election unanimous, v The retir
ing wharfinger is a ' Democrat f and his
successor is a Republican, who was in
dorsed by -the department encampment
of the Grand \u25a0 Army .of the Republic.
According to "the rule : ; allotting one
third of the water front patronage to
each Commissioner, the appointment in'
regular turn belonged to Mr. ;,' Spear.
Casey, who goes out on August 1, was
appointed in | April, 1897,; a t; the
of Major Harney, who was one* of the
Commissioners : appointed by "Governor
Budd." Casey has been in . office seven
years under Republican regime.

;. Andrew Furuseth, at the-head oi a
OPmmittee from the Water Front Fed-"
eratlon, addressed' the board on* the
subject of the eight-hour law. He sug
gested 1 that Healy, Tlbbetts & Co., con
tractors for building the new piers at
the Pacific Mail dock, could employ two
shifts of : men, each shift working eight
hours. In his judgment the law in-,
tended that the individual should work
no longer than eight hours a day un
less extraordinary . emergency - required
that ; he should work jto the limit- of
endurance. ! y.
'Mr.' Healy, representing the contract
ing firm, accepted the suggestion and
withdrew the request for permission to
work twelve hours on filling cylinders
with concrete. * â¢ \u25a0 :â¢
Thomas P. Woodward, City Engineer,
requested ; the Board of ; Harbor Com
missioners to join with the city and
property-owners. in the work of build
ing a bulkhead to the approach of the
bridge at the foot of Third street: The
city controls 37% feet, the property
owners an equal space and the State
dwns ;7H feet v The expense -to the
State .will, approximate $3000. The
Commissioners Instructed Engineer
Norton to participate in the drawing of
plans and specifications. \- -*
The death of Romey; a fine black
horse 'belonging to the State, was an
nounced to the commission . by Chief
Engineer Norton. In six years' service
the animal . had made itself a favorite
and its death was : regretted. .
A large fleet of coasters came ito
port yesterday, bringing lumber and
coal from the forests and mines of the
northern slopes. Most of the arrivals
from the north were favored by fair
winds, and the bluster of Boreas helped
tail and steam alike. Some of the sail
ing vessels made splendid time, which
ihey could hardly have bettered with
tlie aid of a propeller.
The barkcntitie Amelia' came down
from Grays Harbor in steamship time,
Making the run fn three and a half
d;:ys. The schooner Dauntless, also
from Clrays Harbor, was not slow, hav
u\g footed .her way from port to port in

an enigma to many traders, ruling strong in
the face of numerous bearish advices. -Seem
ingly, the only reason that could be. given for
the strength - was -.the . cash situation,' - cash
wheat showing good gains in nearly all ; mar
kets. For both spring. and' fall sown wheat

vorable than . for several weeks, \u25a0 little \u25a0 or . no
rain having fallen since yesterday. Notwith
standing this fact the market opened firm,
with July a shade lower to a shade higher. at
&B%c to S9c. Not much wheat was offered
for sale, and with an active demand from
commission houses prices quickly advanced.
The upturn was more remarkable in \u25a0 view of
the bearish reports received concerning thft
harvesting of the new crop, advices . claiming
an excellent â¢ yield with quality good. - ' For
July: the highest point of the day. was reached
at 90% c. The more distant deliveries showed
a more moderate advance. During the last
half hour much of the gain was lost on 'liberal
realizing. The market, however, closed firm 1
with July at 90@90%c. a gain of l%c. . .
Corn sentiment started out bearish. Later
the market became quite firm and closed with
'prices near the highest" point.' July > closed
unchanged at 54?4c. "

NEW YORK, June 22.â The advance In
prices continued In the Stock Exchange to-day
ter the fourth successive day. The obstacles
encountered In the offerings to take profits In
creased quite materially, cut they were ab
rorbed with considerable facility. The action
of the market* warranted & conviction that the
movement was In the hands of an organized
party of skilled operators cent on attracting
Â« following of outsiders by demonstrating the
j>ossibllities cf strength in the market. Their
faith In the proJH to be derived from this oper
ation is auppesed to be based on the Innate
evidence of etrength afforded by the market
Itself by Its resistance to recent attacks. Con
tentment with the future promise of prosperity
is counted aa the underlying factor la the
bareness of price, but much is heard also of
the probability of large dimensions of a "eleep
tng ehort Interest." the result of an accumu
lation of persistent short selling for a long time
past. A sufficient advance In prices would dle
lodge'euch interest and force It to buy etocks
to cover. The organized campaign which has
developed this week Is clearly designed to lift
the level of prices rather than to effect an In
different accumulation at the lowest prices
possible. The operations give evidence Of an
abundant supply of funds and of resourceful
expedients in manipulation, which chow the
leaders to tÂ» experienced and skillful opera
tors. News developments from hour to hour
ere given less Importance than during the re
cent period, while raall, unorganized traders
were striving for a email turn on prices. A
movement of greater consistency and more
rubrtamlel basis Is evidently designed now.
as Is xht>w3 by the confidence with which
etocks are absorbed on the advances. The
coming eeml-annual dividend and interest dis
bursement*-are supposed to t>e 1n %'lew on the
part of thoee who are seeking to patch vp
price*. The disbursement period gives rise tp
come- natural demand fcr reinvestment of ac
cumulated fund*. Cash reserves are now ac
cumulating In New York rreely on the antici
pation of these requirements, and there seems
jio probability of even a temporary disturbance
of the money market while effecting these dis
bursement*. After that the pressure Of Idle
caplul for Investment is likely to increase.
The advance to-day was not simultaneous at
jb!l j>ointÂ» of the list, but quite comprehensive
gains were established by a system of rotation.
An Improved sentiment .In. the iron trade re
ported by the Iron Age *v dwelt upon, but
tbe Vnl ted "Status Steel stocks themselves were
late In coining into the movement, and the
ireferred stock failed to snare to any extent
at all The Htndricks report on tbe Equitable
Life affairs was regarded as opening new
depths to be sounded. But any unfavorable
afreet on stocks was overridden by the exUt
erice of the speculative campaign. The same
waÂ» true of the crop damage rumors current
in tbe grain market and or reports that the
f'ituiOion between France and Germany over
Morocco was likely to become aculte again.

Mail rejwrts from New York say: "While
one or two representatives of coast packing
interests assert that they have no fault to
r.nd with the condition c* business in future
â¬ried fruits, brokers and commission men gen
fraUy complain of extreme dullness In trade.
The general report is that buyers are hard
to interest in futures of any kind, and that

The weather during the past week has been
quite favorable for the growing crops. In
come few localities late sown wheat and oats
would be benefited by more rain, and owing to
the dry weather grass on the low land range*
In the Interior counties Is turning brown, but
It Is etlU green and abundant In the foothllU
and mountains. 6tcck generally is In excellent
condition, rail wheat le filling nicely and fall
barley Is ripening and will soon be ready to
cut.' Spring wheat continues to make satis
factory progress, and oats, although not In so
good oonfiltlcn as spring wheat, look promising.
*"t* grain aphis Is disappearing, and no great
damage has been done by this pest. Haying
baa begun and will become general In a week
<jr two. Much clover, vetch and alfalfa have al
ready been secured, and the hay crop generally
promises to be an average one. If not better.
Heps are arming and show considerable Im
provement since last report. The yards are
Â»-ell cultivated, but on account of missing hills
and uneven growth yields are expected to be
Jees than usual. Early potatoes are In the
tnarket. Cherries are ripe and the crop Is be
low the average, being gooa In some localities
tmd almost a failure In others. Strawberry
pScktsg Is. nearly finished and the crcp turned
out to be below the average In quantity, but
ebout as usual in quality.

The funeral of Thomas Lobb. the in
saiie carpenter who wounded nine peo
ple from a window in the United States !
Hotel and then blew out his brains on
"Vyednesday, .will be held tinder the aus
pices of the Carpenters' Union, Local
483. The date has not yet been set. The
body was asked for yesterday by Guy
Lathrop, secretary of the union, and re
moved to a private undertaking estab-/
lishmcnt.
The police are mystified as to where
Lobb could have got the amount of
money he shot through the gun barrels
into the crowd. The' remittance he sent
to his father in England must have
taken most of what he earned at his j
tradi Letters from: his brothers and
sisters "show that his family expected
much from . him. He , must have shot

The defendants contend' thit' It does notap

to urge upon 1 friends of labor to use their, pat- j
rcnage for the benefit of labor; that they had
