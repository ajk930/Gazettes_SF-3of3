Upon leaving the Union Iron Works
the Slocum steamed .straight, for the
transport dock, and at 4 o'clock the
passengers were landed. After thank
ing Major- Devob for the pleasant man
ner in which the company had' been
entertained, the guests departed for
their ' various hotels. . The â¢ members of
the Congressional Â» committee were
greatly pleased^ with .< conditions ".as
they found .them here, and. hope to
gather many facts . that, will - aid > them
in â¢; their . deliberations. - In . the , north
they were given history, v not . facts.
Here they - want facts. : They, know, that
Balboa V won â¢ his - reputation i in these
waters; 1 and < that.",, it - was ; he -that
christened- It" the peaceful Â»sea. This
information Is ,well r for;; tn^ poet,; but
. When the estuary was reached, the
Oakland people, headed by j Senator
Perkins, began to do politics. They
pointed out to the commission the ad
visability of cutting a channel 500 feet
wide and twenty-five feet deep through
the entire length of the estuary, and
asked that the- members of. the com
mission stand for the improvement
when Congressional aid was asked.
The members of the committee were
supplied with statistics showing the
number of vessels charged wharfage
during the year at only one wharf, the
total tonnage reaching 107,400. When
the Slocum began to churn up the mud
from the bottom of the estuary the
committee frankly- admltte'd .that, for
those that preferred perfumes to dif
ferent odors the deepening of the har
bor would be", a decided Improvement
and they promised to . remember the
situation. Senator Perkins and- the
other Oaklanders were gratified at the
business-like manner â¢ in which the
commission^ graspea the situation,; but
if much comes of the, trip the " Slocum
must be given full credit for the part
she played as official demonstrator of
the shallowness of the estuary and 'the
unpleasant constituency â¢ of the mud
that lines its bottom,
Upon leavi'hg the estuary the Slocum
was headed for the Hunters Point'dry
docks, where "the giant Algoa is under
going repairs, and then the. run was
made to the Union Iron Works, where
the first stop was made. This gave
Congressmen Livernash . and Wynn a
chance to show what San Francisco is
doing, just to offset all that Senator
Perkins had pointed out of Oakland's
wants. The best of good feeling and
spirit of co-operation â¢ existed among
the California members of the national
legislature, however, and It was point
ed out ; that whatever Oakland wants,
San Francisco is with her, and- if , San
Francisco wants something/ Oakland
will aid her to get it. This was the
spirit expressed by both Livernash and
Wynn for San Francisco ; and 'Â¦ Senator
Perkins, for his home section.

Not a moment was wasted by Major
Devol when it was announced that all
were on board and the Slocum rwung
quickly out into the stream and at noon
was plowing 'the; waters of the Gold
en Gate. Here the vessel emerged from
the gray gloom " that spread over the
city and a true California day was at
hand, the warm sun raising the spirits
of all. Off the shore of gausalito

called to the stern of the vessel, under

were given a. view of Angel Island and

was turned - toward â¢ the Oakland ' estu

COMMISSION ARRIVES.
Four members of the Merchant Ma
rine Committee of Congress stood on
the deck of the United States transport
tug Slocum at noon yesterday and
looked out through the Golden Gateâ
the portal of the highway to the
Orient. It was a revelation to them,
they said, and brought to them full
realization of the growing importance
of the West and the great part nature
had played in equipping it for the fight
for world wide recognition that Is be
fore it. . .
These distinguished visitors swept
the harbor with the eyes of critics,
looked up at the big guns mounted on
the heights of the Presidio and then
across at those crowning the hills of
Marin,. mounted higher than the steel
guardians of Gibraltar. That the har
bor is Impregnable from without, the
commissioners said they were sure and
a safer haven within they had never
seen. Words, they said, could not ex
press their admiration for this, the
great port of the Western Bea,

on the Slocum, with the ladles of their
party, Mrs. Minor, Mrs. Spight and two
daughters, and Mrs. Humphrey.
The arrival here from Portland, Or.,
yesterday morning of the members of
the commission marked an era in the
commercial, history of California and
their stay here to receive suggestions
as to measures that^wlll lead to' the
expansion of the American merchant
marine is sure to prove of great ad
vantage to the State. While here they
will learn of needs of the State other
than those of commerce and the cor

place them In the ranks of California's
friends in the halls of Congress.

port that the railway attorneys and

beet} active. A email article that was
published some -weeks ago in -a San
'Francisco paper touching on the Pan

sternation among the people connected
with the Karriman interests. Dis
patches were sent promptly from the
East to business men in this city ask
ing them to refrain from discussing
the- P.anama Railway and its contract
with the. Pacific Mail Steamship Com
.pany through" the agency of the news
papers. %
Soon after that a secret conference
'was arranged to take place in this city
between the executive committee of the

mercial' Interests of the Pacific Coast,
and J. C. Stubbs and "William Sproule
of .the Southern Pacific Company and
R. ;P. Schwerin of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company. The parties came
together in San Francisco and were
conferring as secretly as possible -when
The Call published the facts, creating
.thereby no little sensation among the
co.nterees. Â¦ Since then, although various
assertions have been made regarding
the ; railway situation on the isthmus
end the moves of the representatives
of â¢ Harrlman. no response has been
made. Nothing has been said by In

that the Panama board's representation

Involved in the opening of the Pana

Passing pedestrians, attracted by. the;
notice and similar announcements dis

into interested throngs about the front

soda fountain. which advertises a

ma Railway Commission, of which
mention has been made in The Call, it
is learned that the President expressed
his wish that contracts against public
policy shall not .be renewed when they
expire. Business men of this city ar
gue that it would not be public policy
to tie up the Panama' canal, when it is
ready for operation, witli any private
corporations, to be used exclusively in
their interest. As a consequence of this
consideration, and arguing along the
same lines, they Bay that it is not pub
lic policy, when the Government has
control of a short transcontinental rail
way oÂ£ its own, complete In its facil
ities for handling business, to give that
over to 1 i controlled by corporations
that are operating in restraint of sea
commerce for their own benefit, and to
the detriment of seaports on both the
Atlantic and the Pacific seaboard of
the United States.
A Washington dispatch received yes
terday is as follows:
"The United States Government can
not abrogate contracts made by the
Panama Railway Company with other
transportation companies until April
1, 1305, at the earliest. Although it
owns sixty-nine-seventieths of the
stock it has but three of the directors,
and will not have the necessary major
ity until the date mentioned. The
three Government directors are mem
bers of the Panama. Commission. Un
der the contracts made by the Panama
Railway Company with the Pacific
Steam Navigation Company and' the
Chilean Steamship Company, the con
tracts expire by limitation on Septem

MOTIEX PASS, Manchuria, July 17
(via Seoul, Korea, Aug. 3). â The Rus
sians in their second unsuccessful at
tempt to retake Motien Pass early on
the morning of July 17, were repulsed
and forced back to their original po
sitions after five hours of severe fight
ing. They suffered heavy losses as
compared with the Japanese casual
ties. Three regiments were engaged
on tke Russian side. They were the
Ninth and Twenty-fourth East Sibe
rian regiments, which failed to distin
guish themselves in the previous at
tacks, and the Thirty-fourth regulars
of the Ninth Division.* Opposed to
them were one Japanese regiment and
one battery. The European regulars,
who for the first time met General
Kuroki's soldiers, proved in no wise
superior to the Siberian contingents of
the Russian army.
The Russians took advantage of the
heavy fog which enveloped the moun
tains. They began to advance at 2
o'clock in the morning and at 5
o'clock they opened tire, when the
mist was so dense that it was impos
sible for the Japanese to see them
more than 100 feet away. Major Gen
eral Okazaki learned of the Russians'
purpose to renew the attack on the
pass and also when they prepared to
leave their camps, but the heavy fog
prevented the Japanese gaining Infor

The Japanese were badly handicapped
until 9 o'clock, when the fog cleared
away somewhat.
The attack began on the ledge be

engagement of July 4 occurred, and
the severest fighting was against the
Russians, who had gained the temple

The Japanes? outpost companies
were forced from these trenches after
bayonet fighting to the summit of the

VLADIVOSTOK, Aug. 3.â The recep
tion of the cruisers Rossaiy, Grombol
and Rurik on their return from their
latest expedition was enthusiastic.
Rear Admiral Jessen was in signal
communication with Vice Admiral
Skrydloff. for ten hours before the
squadron rached port.
As a result of the cruise naval of
ficers believe a check will be given to
British and American shipowners car
rying contraband of war, or at. least
additional burdens will be imposed upon
Japan by an increase in freight rates.
Officials of the squadron are Indignant
over the criticism by British and Amer
ican newspapers "over the lawlessness
of the cruisers," asserting that the
complete detailing of the cruise will
show that Admiral Jessen displayed
the greatest humanity and acted within
his rights and instructions.
The crew of the Japanese vessel
Okashlma were set on shore before the
ship was sunk by the Rossaiy, and
the crews of the two schooners which
were far from shore were taken on
board the Russian vessels.
The steamship Camara, belonging to
the Cullom Company of London, when
stopped was bound for Muroran for
coal. The officers Bay that she had
evidently brought contraband from
Europe to Yokohama. They allege that
she was on her way to Muroran with
the intention of loading coal for de
livery at Japanese ports or to the Jap
anese fleet. Although the Camara could
have been seized^ she had not enough
coal to get her to Vladivostok and was
given ! the benefit of a doubt and re
leased.
The Klobuniu, a Japanese vessel, al
though subject to confiscation, was re
leased because there were women on
board.
The British. ship Knight Commander,
when signaled to stop declined to do
bo, even after three shots had been
fired across her bows; and the officers
say that her evident intention was to
make an effort to escape, which in
itself rendered her liable under Rus
sian naval rules to have a shot fired
into her hull. She stopped, however,
at the fourth shot, and was fgund to
contain between 3000 and 4000 tons of
railway material from New York for
Kobe and Yokohama. As the Knight
Commander had not enough coal to go
to_ Vladivostok* Admiral Jessen was
confronted with the alternative of re
leasing her and allowing her cargo,
as he believed, to reach the Japanese,
or of destroying her. As it was plain
ly, in the opinion of Admiral Jessen,
one of the, extraordinary cases coming
under Russian prize regulations, the
! admiral assumed the responsibility of
sinking i the ship, although she was
flying a neutral flag. A high Russian
officer said to a correspondent:
"The irresponsible protests of the
British i newspapers In this case arfi
perhaps pardonable, but the protest of
the . British Government, even before
it was possible to know any of the
circumstances >. surrounding the action
of S Rear . Admiral Jessen, is . certainly
strange. The captain of - the Knight
Commander -does not deny that his
cargo was contraband of war." -

JvIEL THi: THEA'S HOME PORT.
.. General Zarabouieff's and General
Stakelberg's corps formed the right
wing at Anshanshan. The First Si
berian and the Tenth European corps
were on the left. The recently arrived
Seventeenth corps and the portion of
General Stoessel's corps which is not
at Port Arthur were at Liaoyang.
The Russian forces last night con
stituted a compact chain- in the form
of a E'emi-clrcle around Liaoyang, ex
tending from Anshanshan, half way
between Haicheng and Liaoyang, to
Anping, which is only thirteen miles
east of Liaoyang. Unless the bulk of
General Kurooatkin's army has al
ready been withdrawn north of Liao
yang it is difficult to see how he could
now do so with such great pressure,
the Japanese being almost upon his
main lines.
as portions' of four army
corps were engaged in the fighting up
to last night, and as these corps
comprise three-quarters of the
whole Russian army, it seems certain
that nothing except a portion of the
etqres and munitions have yet been
removed. Nevertheless, well informed
military attaches express the opinion
that General Kuropatkin will get away
with the bulk of the main army if he
linds the chances against him.
IIOW THE FORCES ARE DISPOSED
f From the beat information obtain
able as to General Kuropatkin's dispo
sition of his forces they were located
this morning as follows:
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug 3. â In a
dispatch to the Emperor dated August
2 General Kuropatkin says:^
"Our troops have retired from Hai
cheny, along the road toward . Anshan-.
shan." The movement was accom
plished in perfect order and the ene
my did not disturb us.
"The terrible heat has caused many
sunstrokes and measures have been
taken to diminish the equipment the
troops have hitherto been obliged to
carry by transporting it in supply
carts. There is no serious news from
the eastern front."
Whether a general engagement is
already progressing around Liaoyang
between the forces of General Kuro
patkin and the three Japanese armies
which have been moved against them
from the south and east the decisive
battle of the campaign fs regarded as
certain if the Japanese energetically
follow up their preliminary successes
of the last three ' days. At various
points the fighting has been of a des
perate and bloody character, the, Rus
sians offering Btubborn resistence. The
losses, therefore, although their ex
tent I is not yet established, must be
heavy on both sides. Between 6000
and 8000 men is one estimate given
of the Russian losses. All the esti
mates, however, are little better than
guesswork as yet and possibly the
Russian casualties may be much
larger.
KUROPATKIN'S LINES BROKEN.
The strong screen drawn around
General Kuropatkin's interior posi
tions has been driven in at all points,
Haicheng being practically abandoned
without a blow. The pressure of the
Japanese numbers and the failure to
hold the northern positions probably
rendered it useless to try to hold out
there.
It was plain that the Japanese sol
diers were possessed of much greater
initiative and dash than the Russians.
The engagement was a fair test of the
capacities of the two forces, and the
net result of it was that one Japanese
regiment, only three battalions of
which were on the firing line, defeated
three Russian regiments in spite of the
fact that another Russian regiment
was held in reserve. The Russians em
ployed their artillery much more than
the Japanese did theirs.
It is impossible to estimate the losses
at this hour.. Desultory firing con
tinues as the Russians retreat, and
dead and wounded men are being
brought In by the hospital corps. The
Japanese believe ftmt their casualties
number about 200. The i Russian casu
alties are undoubtedly much greater
than in the former engagement. Rus
sian dead are being buried all over the
field, the temporary^hospitals are filled
with wounded, while a few unwounded
Russians who had hidden in the fields
are surrendering.
The Russians made a hurried but
fairly orderly retreat down the valley.
They left behind them, however, many
dead and wounded men, a number of
rifles, drums, great coats and trenching
tools. A Russian battery took up a
position in the valley and fired a few
rounds to cover the retreat, and infan
trymen were brought up in good order
by their officers to the support of the
guns.
BROWN MEN QUTFIGIIT WHITE.
The white coats worn by the Russian
officers made them conspicuous targets
for the Japanese. The Russian firing
was altogether in volleys, while the
Japanese fired at will. The Russian
troops kept in close formation, while
the Japanese soldiers deployed In ex
tended order.
When the sun dispelled the fogr at
about 9 o'clock, the Japanese made
quick work of the affair. At this hour
the Russian line extended across the
valley and along the sides of the hills
on either side of the valley, while the
Japanese occupied the ridge from
which the pass debouches and the hill
sides on the Russian flanks.
One Russian battery fired upon the
Japanese for two hours and to this
fire a Japanese battery on the ridge
replied.
this temple, which the Russians held
for three hours, in spite of -a -rain of
bullets from the opposite ridge.
. The Russian dead and' .wounded
were thick about the temple. Five
dead men had fallen in the road on
their faces. Their rifles were under
them, They had been killed just as
they appeared over the crest of the
hill.

The map shows the position of the
Russian defenses around Tort Arthur,
as ascertained by the intelligencs de
partment of the Japanese army a short
time before the beginning of hostilities.
It is probable that changes and im
provements have been made since that
time, which, so far as are known, are
summed up by the war expert of the
European edition of the New York
Herald. He divides the perimeter of
Port Arthur into seven lines of de
fenses, four of which are on the land
side and three fronting on the sea. .
The first on the land side, beginning
on the east, crowns the crest of Riluns
fehan, with a big fort 450 feet above the
sea, which is very strong. The second
line occupies the summit of Itshan and
protects the flank of the first. The
third. includes the heights west of the
town, which is the weakest position of
all. The fourth line runs from tht
southern extremity of the Sunchan
Hills. to the southwest extremity of the
peninsula.
On the sea side the principal group is
on Zolotaia Gora (mountain of gold);
the next the range of earthworks on
the Tiger's Tall, and the last link In
the line consists ot coast batteries in
the direction of White Wolf hilL The
experts conclude as follows:
"To sum up, the defense of Port Ar
thur is assured by three very power
ful forts, twenty medium ones, and
twelve smaller works, where there are
about 300 guns In the batteries. These
also may have been reinforced by naval
guns."

the Knight Commander, together with
the ship's papers, were taken off.
In the case of the German steamer
Thea, Admiral Jessen had no doubt
that her cargo, which consisted offish,
was distinctly contraband of .war. Her
crew was taken off at night during a
heavy sea and she was sent to the bot
tom.
STRONG DEFENSES
OF PORT ARTHUR
ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 3.-ThÂ»
first Russian resort of the storming
operations at Port Arthur has just been
received from the Consul of Russia at
Chefu. It says a general attack began
on Saturday, with the Japanese In im
mense force. There were two days of
a bombardment of unprecedented vio
lence. The Japanese, at the time uf
sending this dispatch, the Consul adds,
had everywhere been repulsed with
great loss. The Japanese casualties
possibly reached 20.000. but the Rus
sian losses were insignificant.
The Consul further reports that the
Russians have an abundance of am
munition.
CHEFU, Aug. 3.â The steamship
Wuchow, which has Just arrived here
from Ncwchwang, brings further de
tails of the latest Japanese assault on
Port Arthur. When nearing Chefu the
Wuchow picked up a Junk carrying
seven men, four women and one boy,
who left Port Arthur yesterday. They
report that the fighting north of the
city of Port Arthur occurred at Wolf
Hill, and waa sanguinary, resulting in
the repulse of the Japanese. This hill
is situated near the railroad and eight
trains were kept busy bringing the
wounded soldiers into the city. The
wounded men from the east forts
reached Port Arthur in all kinds of
vehicles, many, however, coming afoot,
dragging shattered limbs.
RUSSIAN' FLEET TAKES PART.
The Russians unite in declaring that
the fortress will never fall, but they
expect that scarcely a building will be
left in the city, where there is now
scarcely a whole pane of glass.
The Wuchow confirms the statement
that the fighting abated during tha
night of July 28, but It had not com
pletely subsided when the refugees
left.
The Russian fleet, from its anchor
age, shelled the advancing Japanese,
after returning from what seemed to
have been a reconnoltering maneuver.
Chinese arriving here to-night say
that the Japanese actually captured
two lightly garrisoned forts on the east
shore, but abandoned them when their
comrades were repulsed from other po
sitions. The Russians, however, insist
that this is untrue.
The forts at Port Arthur bristle with
guns, including many of S-lnch caliber,
but the naval artillerymen are alleged
to have inflicted the heaviest loss upon
the Japanese.
The present unusual exodus from
Port Arthur Is due to the granting
of permission to leave the besieged
city, which heretofore the Russian or
ficials have withheld. In most Instances
the refugees are persons of the better
class, vho are compelled to pay ex
orbitant prices for junks, which arÂ«
scarce.
ASSAULT TO BE RENEWED.
The Japanese, while repulsed, have
by no means been beaten, and a re
newal of the fighting was expected
when the junk departed yesterday
from Port Arthur.
A second junk, which left at the same
time, carrying the officials of the Dan
ish East Asiatic Company and their
families, has not yet arrived at Chefu.
Among: the prisoners captured dur
ing the engagement on "Wolfs Moun
tain was a Japanese lieutenant carry
ing; a freshly written letter, statins that
the fighting had been severe and the
Japanese losses heavy. The Japan??*
are now occupying the outpost
trenches, which they captured from tha
Russians.
Both the Japanese and Russian fleets
are reported to be in excellent condi
tion.
Contraband goods for the Japanese
continue to leave Chefu via Weihalwei.

message was received; hence the name
of Knight did not appear in the orig
inal announcement.
"I will accept."
Knight was in the country when the
message was received In this city, but
he was promptly advised of the con
tents of the telegram. He did not wire
his acceptance until his return home
on Tuesday evening. In the meantime
another message came from Cortelyou,
in which an immediate response to the
first telegram was requested. Knight
then wired:
On July 30. Chairman Cortelyou wired
from Chicago to George A. Knight in
San Francisco, asking the latter If
he would accept an appointment to the
Executive Committee of the Republican
National Committee, stating in the dis
patch that acceptance would require
Knight's presence in Chicago during
the greater part of the campaign. The
telegram, however, explained that en
gagements would be made for Knight
to speak at several important meet-
Ings in the East.

Tl}e mor.ftary and economic policies which
have been so forcibly reannounced lie at the
very foundation cf our industrial life, and arj
essential to the fullest development of our
national strength. They give vitality to our
manufactures and commerce, and if impaired
or overthrown there would inevitably ensuÂ» a
period of industrial depression, to the serious
injury of the vast Interests of both labor and
capital.
The Republican party, since U preserved the
Integrity of th-? republic and save freedom to
the orrressed, never rendered a more Import
ant service to the country than when It estab
lished the gold standard. Under It we have in
creased our currency supply sufficiently to
meet the normal requirements of business. It
is gratifying that the convention made frank
and explicit declaration of the inflexible pur
pose of the oarty to maintain the gold stand
ard. It is essential not only that ths stand
ard should be aÂ» sood as the test In the world,
but that thÂ»> people should . have the assur
ance that It will be so maintained.
Senator Fairbanks was given en ova
tion as he arose to accept the nomina
tion. He said:
Mr. Root and Gentlemen of the Committee â
I thank you for the very generous terms in
which you have conveyed the official notifica
tion of my nomination for Vice President of
the United States. The unsolicited and unani
mous nomination by the Republican party is
a call to duty which I am pleased to obey.
I accent the commission which you bring
with a. profound sense of the dignity and re
sponsibilities of the exalted position for which
I have been nominated. My utmost endeavor
will bs to discharge In full measure the trust
if the action of the convention shall meet the
approval of the American people.
The plattorm adopted by the convention Is an
explicit and emphatic declaration of the prin
ciples in entire harmony with those policies of
our party, which have brought great honor and
prosperity to our common country, and which.
if continued, v/111 bring us like blessings In the
future.
FAIRBANKS RESPONDS.
In your election, on the other hand, this
chief requirement will be fully met. in the
full streriCth of middle life you are prepared
for the exhausting duties of the Presidency.
Your successful and d!stin*uish-:d career, the
ability and croblty with which you have al
ready discharged the duties of high office, thi
universal reaix-ct and esteem of the Deoole of
Indiana who have delighted to honor you, the
attachment of hosts of friends throughout the
Union â all assurw us that you have the char
acter and the ability to govern wisely and
strongly should you become President. Many
indeed amonr our people have already turned
toward you as a tultable candidate to be
elected directly to that great office.
It Is the earnest wish of your party and of
many good citizens who have no party affi'la
ti&ns that you shall accept this nomination,
and that you shall be elected in November to
be thi next Vice President of the United
States. In expressing to you thts wish, we
b- c to add an assurance of our own personal
respect, esteem and loyalty.
ThÂ» demands of the Presidential office upon
the mental and physical vitality are so rreat.
so continuous and so exhausting as to be whol
ly beyond thÂ« capacity of any man of eighty
five.
The attempt by 6uch a man to perform the
duties of the office would with practical cer
tainty be speedily followed by a complete
breakdown, both of body and mind. In con
templating the remote possibility of the elec
tion of the Democratic candidate for Vice
President, the people of the country are bound
to contemplate also as a necessary result of
such an election In case of the President's
death, that others, not chosen by the people,
and we know not who, would govern In' the
narce of a nominal successor unable himself
to perform tie constitutional duties of his
office; or worse still, that aerlous doubt
whether the Vice President had not reached
a condition of "Inability" within the meaning
of the Constitution would throw the title to
the office of President into dispute.
The serious effect of cuch an event upon the
Government ami uocn business Interests and
general welfare of the country, and the seri
ous effect even of the continual menace of such
an event, must be apparent to every thought
ful mind.
have nominated as their candidate for the Vice
Presidency an excellent gentleman, who waa
born during the Presidency of James Monroe,
and who before the 4th of March next will be
In the eighty-second year of his age. Before
the next administration Is ended he will be
approaching his eighty-sixth birthday. It Is
no disparagement ot this gentleman, for whom
I believe we all have the highest respect, to
Â«ay that he shares the common lot of mortals.
and that the election of any man of such great
age would furnish no safeguard to the Ameri
can people against the disaster which would
ensue upon the death of a' President with a
successor not competent to perform the duties
of the Presidential office. It is common expe
rience that very aped men, however bright
and active they may appear for brief periods,
cannot sustain long continued severe exertion.
DEMANDS ARE GRLLAT.
Our opponents of. the Democratic party have
signally failed to perform this duty. They
As to the supreme responsibility of the Vice
Presidency in case of succession to thÂ» Presi
dency, we tfcall all pray, and no one more earn
estly than yourself, that it may not come to
you. But we are not at liberty to Ignore the
possibility that It may come. Sad and bitter
experien.^e 'admonishes us that provision for
succession to the Presidency Is no Idle form
Of the last twelve Presidents elected by the
-pecple of the United States five â nearly one
half â have died in office and have been suc
ceeded by Vica Presidents. A serious obliga
tion rests upon the political parties which se
lect the candidates between whom the people
must choose, to see to it that they nominate
men fofthis possible suceezslon who have the
strength of body and mind and character which
shall enable them. If occasion ccraes, to take
up the burdens of the great Presidential office,
to endure Its trylns and exhausting demands,
to meet its great respcrsibllitles. and with flrm
band and clear vision to guide the Government
of the country un'Al the people can express
their choice again.
SERIOUS OBLIGATION'.
ctnfidenre and sympathy. Too often it has hap
ptsed that alter excited ccntcsts for the Pres
idential nomination the candidate for Vice
President has been rejected from the defeated
faction for the purpose of appeasing their re
sentment, and that after election he has re
mained antagonistic in rpirlt and a etranser to
the counsels of the President whom he may be
called upen to succeed. Happily we are now
in no such case. The people would fain see
ajrsin such relations of sympathy and loyal
r.eiptulness for the public gooi as existed be
tv.-een President MciCiiiley and Vice President
Hobart; ar.d the personal relations between
President Kocsevelt and yourself, your mutual
esteem and good understanding assure us that
theee happy conditions will come again after
the 4th of next March. We count upon your
wisdom and experience and loyal aid as an ele
ment of ever present strength In the coming
administration. v
But the Vice I'-resident has ether grave du
ties of imperative obligation. When the people
elect a President under our political system
they do not merely telect the man for the
otfi.-e; they ijive their approval to certain con
trolling principles and policies of government;
and the administration of which the Vice Prcs
idert is a part Is bound to give effect to theee
principles and policies. The primary duty of
the Vice PrÂ«*siJer.t to be always ready to
take up the burden of the Presidency If occa
sion requiies, carries with it the duty to bÂ«
always ready to continue unbroken the policies
which the people have Intrusted to the admin
istration for execution. Fcr the due perform
ance cf this duty the Vice President should
be familiar with the conduct of affairs by the
administration as it proceeds, a part of its
counsels and imbued with a knowledge of its
labors, its perplexities and Its motives, that
can come only from Intimate association ami
It Is a great o.'&ce to which you are called.

ILLUSTRIOUS NAMES.
We give you formal notice of that nomina
tion with assurance of the undivided and
hearty cuppcrt of the great party which has
executed the people's will in the government
of this country for the better part of the last
half century. The nomination comes to you
in accordance with the txrst methods and prac
tices of representative government. It was
the r*?ult of lor.g and earnest consideration
and discussion by the members of the con
vection. It was not the chance product of an
excited hour, asd It waa not upon the de
mand of any powerful Influence â political or
otherwise â constraining the Judgment of the
delegates. It was not made for the purpose
of Conciliating possible malcontents or of
eweilinjj the campaign fund of the party. No
bargains or intrleuea contributed to it. No
suppressions of the truth or misleading of the
convention as to ycur principles and opinions
were necessary to bring It about. It was the
deliberate. Informed and Intelligent Judgment
of the delegates from every State and Terri
tory, and it was their unanimous Judgment.
Root, without preliminary, delivered
the formal notification address. He
said:
Senator Fairbanks â The commlttea which
now walta ujon you waa appointed by the
National Convention cf the Republican Party
held at Chicago la June, and its agreeable
duty is to notify you of your nomination as
the Republican candsdata for the office of Vice
President of the United States for the term
to begin en the 4th day of March. 1905.
ZN-DIAXAPOLJS, Aug. 3.â Charles
W. Fairbanks, senior United States
Senator from Indiana, was to-day for
mally notified of his nomination for
Vice President of the United States by
the Republican National Convention.
The notification address was made by
Elihu Root, ex-Secretary of War, who
was temporary chairman of the con
vention. The exercises were held on
the wide veranda of Senator Fairbanks'
i bea.utiful home in the presence of mem
! bers of the notification committee, con
i eisting of one member from each State
: and Territory, the Governor and other
State officers of Indiana, the Republi
i can candidates for State offices, the
' Indiana Republican Congressional dele
1 patio;*. Indiana delegates and alter
nates to the national convention, the
State Central Committee and the re
publican Editorial Association. All'
these had been especially invited.
On the lawn surrounding three sides
of the residence and extending far on
all sides beneath the preat forest trees
1 were several thousand friends, neigh
bors and political supporters of the
senior Senator. Massed In a body were
1000 members of the Marion Club, who
had acted as escort for the distin
guished visitors. Flags were seen
everywhere. The house was elaborately
decorated and on one side of the lawn
two large tents were topped by wav
ing banners. The day was one of the
most beautiful of the year.
SERVE LUNCH ON THE LAWN.
The especially invited guests and the
! general public were served with light
i refreshments, and a photograph of the
: committee and candidate was taken
i from the steps of the veranda.
The members of the notification com
i mittee arrived early. Ex-Secretary
i Root, after being given an informal
! reception, joined ihe other members of
the committee at the English HoteL
Sbortiy after noon the journey of one
j end a half miles to the Senator's
home began. One thousand members
j of the llarlon Club acted as escorts.
| In the first carriage rode Mr. Root and
I Governor Durbin and Harry S. New,
National Committeeman from Indiana.
The notification committee and other
guests followed In carriages. Several
; thousand persons cheered as the line
I moved along.
Gathered at the residence were 5000
j persons. Senator Fairbanks and Mrs.
I Fairbanks received the committee and
' especially Invited guests. Mr. Root and
j Senator Fairbanks led the way to the
! veranda, where seats were arranged
for all. An enthusiastic greeting was
accorded the two speakers when they
appeared on the veranda. The demon
stration lasted for several minutes,
during which the members of the com
mittee were seated.
' ROOT GIVES NOTICE.
I*ater I shall avail myself of a favorable op
portunity to submit to you, and through you
to my fellow citizens, a fuller expression ot my
views concerning -the question now at Issue.
Permit me a$ain to thank you and to ex
press the belief that we -may confidently sub
mit our cause to the candid and patriotic JudgÂ«
ment of our countrymen.
The election of the President Is Imperatively
demanded by those whoso success depends upon
ths continuance of a safe, conservative and ef
ficient administration of public affairs.
-We have an ample record of deeds done, of
beneficent thinga accomplished in the public
interest. The vast business of the Govern
ment has been w^ll administered^ The laws
have beon enforced fearlessly and Impartially.
The treasury has been adequately supplied
with revenue and the financial credit of tho
Government was never better. Our foreign
trade balance continues to Increase our national
wealth. We have adopted an Irrigation policy
which will build homes In the arid regions of
the West. The Panama canal, the hope of
centuries, is in course of construction under
the solo protection of the American flag.
We have peace and great prosperity at home
and are upon terms of gcoi neighborhood to
the entire worll. These conditions constitute
the 6trcngÂ«?st possible assurance for the fu
tnre.
The convention was wise not only tn its
enunciation of party policies, but in its nom
ination of a candidate for the Presidency.
During the lÂ»st three years President Roose
velt has been confronted with large and serious
questions. These he has met and solved with
high wisdom and courage. The charsea made
against him In the Democratic platform find
an irrefutable answer in his splendid admin
istration, never surpassed in all the history
of the republic nnd never equaled by tho
party which aerks to discredit It.
PRAISES ROOSEVELT.
In Consrces and net with tho President
rests the supreme power to determine the
standard of our money. Though the chlaf
executive rhould oppose, the Congress, acting
within its independent constitutional authority,
could at any time overthrow or change the
monetary standard.
The wisdom of our protective policy finds
complete Justification in the Industrial develop
ment of the country. Th'^ policy has btrcoma
a most vital part of our industrial system and
must be maintained unimpaired. When altered
conditions make changes in schedules desirable
their modification can be sarely intrusted to
the Republican party. If iney ar* to be"
changed by the enemies of the system along
free trade ltnÂ«S uncertainty, would take the
place of certainty and a rractlon would surely
follow to the injury of the wage-earners and
all who are now profitably employed. Un
certainty undermines confidence and loss of
confidence breeds confusion and distress la
commercial affairs.

of these palpable facts, it Is not thÂ« part of
wisdom to abandon our vigilance In safe
guarding thÂ« integrity of our money gystem.
We must have net only a President who is un

PARKERSBURG. W. Va.. Aug. 3.â
The Democratic State Convention was
in session two hours this afternoon and
almost three hours to-night without
reaching the regular order of business,
which was left over until to-morrow.
Awaiting the report and the platform
the time was devoted to oratory.
The con%-ention to-night indulged In
wild and continued demonstrations as
Henry G. Davis entered the wigwam.
Chairman McGraw formally intro
duced the Vice Presidential candidate.
Davis thanked the convention for its
hearty greeting and expressed the hope
that harmony would continue until No
vember. Davis said:
I cannot refrain from an expression of my
gratification at this large and enthusiastic
convention of Democrats, showing 1 as it does
thÂ° same spirit ot determination in West Vir
ginia that pervades all sections of the country.
Our national standard-bearer, Judje Parker,
Â¦will on the 10th day of this month, be for
mally notified of his nomination, and In the
acceptance thereof will naturally gfvo his
views upon the questions at Issue In the cam
paign. A week later, on the 17th of the
menth. as you all know, I will be notified at
White Sulphur SprinÂ«r3 of my nomination for
the office of Vice President, and at that tlmÂ«
it will be ray duty to plve soma expression
of my views. It is, therefore. I think, my
duty both to our candidate for the Presidency
and to our party that I should not now enter
Into the discussion of my position. I con
gratulate you all upon this harmonious and
enthusiastic Catherine. All appreciate v tho re
sponsibility that is upon you, and I am satis
fied that your nominees will be men suited to
I*ad the party to victory. Thanking you again
for your kind expressions of good will I con
gratulate you upon the prospects for the suc
cess of the Democracy both la this State and
nation. v
As Davis was concluding some one
called: "Hurrah for Mr. White Man's
party," and Davis replied:
â i!I certainly agree with you on the
white man proposition."
Then foli- ,ved a demonstration.

Mr. Schwerin, "for there is no doubt
that with American merchants, Amer

corporations located all over the

the means of creating the carrying

SAN FRANCISCAN WALKS
FROM COAST TO ST. LOUIS
Starts With Three Cents and Arrives
at Fair With Three Burros
and a Colt.
ST. LOUIS, Aug. 3.â M. G. Harman
of San Francisco arrived in St. Louis
Monday, having walked all the way
from San Francisco.
After leaving Lc-s Angeles, when he
neared the edge of the desert, he se
cured a team of three burros, which
he hitched to a cart of his own build
ing, using this vehicle to transport
his baggage and camp equipment. Ten
weeks ago a colt was born, which Har
man named Pitts. Since then It has
traveled 1200 miles, apparently thriv
ing on the long journey, .w?.;
Harman started with a three-cent
piece. He says that at no time during
the journey has he possessed a much
larger sum, but he was never hungry
and the burros were fed regularly.
In Southern California he was joined
by T. E. Holden of Azusa, Cal., who
has been with him since.

they extend an invitation to come and
tell their stories, that the nation may
be enriched and the American ship sail

A WONDERFUL HARBOR.
Regarding the impressions he had
gained on the trip around the bay,
Senator Gallinger said:
You cannot say too much about this wonder
ful harbor. There la no finer port in the
world and we are going to do everything we
can to aid In building up a great shipping
trade her* and In every port of the I nlon.

know that in the upbuilding of the great West

turers and tradeemen of the entire nation bene
fited. This Is a fact people must learn to ap
preciate. When .they do. sectionalism, etateUm
will die and we will advance higher than we
are above the rest of the nations of the globe.
IMPORTANCE OF THIS PORT.
Congressman Minor had the follow
ing to say:
San Francisco has become one of the Im
portant swa ports of our country and Is des
tined to become one of the great maritime
ports of the world, but. as Important as it is
at the present time, it la but the beginning of
what It Is destined to become within a com
paratively short time. Dewey-9 guns at Ma
nila changed the commercial map While the
boys behind the guns ceased Urine to take
their breakfast the Pacific Coast was bound-
Ing forward at a more- rapid pace than was
then possible to measure; Us commercial sun
had risen, and when the bugle *oÂ«n d . ed *Â°
arms and the work in hand was finished, the
victory won. with the Â»tarÂ« and stripes wav
ing triumphantly over Manila Bay. a bright
and promUlns future came within easy grasp
of the Pacific Coast, and especially of this city.
This 19 truly a commercial age. The contest
la on-not a contest between Individuate, but
it la a contest that Involves the three greatest
industrial nations of the earth, one of which
Is the United States. W here, I ask. Is the
true American who fears the battle or doubts
the results? With unlimited resources, skill,
enterprise and genius such as no other coun
try can fairly reckon on, we fear not and will
fail In anything tending to keep our country in
advance of the nations of the earth. Your
future cannot bo measured by the record you
have already made, bright and pleasing as
it is Ban Francisco is a great city. You have a
harbor unsurpassed In size and but few surpass
It in depth. You have the resources of country
tributary to It that Is well nigh an empire of
Itself and with a people filled with push,
energy and enterprise, you arc in the highway
that lÂ»ads to a future greatnesw that no man
of Intelligence will dare to measure at this
time. Â¦ Your people have given evidence that
they appreciate the importance of the work
of our commission and that Is very pleasing
to us. We all love Americanism wherever we
find It and we are gratified to witness it here
In your city. We shall always remember your
people with kindness and our best wishes will
be for the continued growth of San Francisco.
INJURY OF SECTIONALISM.
Representative Humphrey said he
was very much impressed with the har
bor and though he came from Wash
ington State he did not feel that in
endeavoring to aid San Francisco he
was working to the detriment of his
home ports. "There is enough trade in
the Pacific for all of us," he said, "and
we should all wbrk together. Section
alism always works injury. By im
proving one port the other Is stirred
to make improvements and thus the
great end we are working for, the up
building of the merchant marine, is
furthered."
Congressman Spight said he was as
tonished at what he had seen. He had
no Idea of the size and beauty of the
harbor and hoped that the efforts of
the commission of which he is a mem
ber will devise ways and means that
will put the American flag on the ma
jority of the vessels, daily growing in
number, that carry cargoes from and
bring them" to this harbor. "

"Captain" Kellner was a native of
Hanover and 68 years of age. Surviving
him are a wife and two married daugh
ters. No arrangements have yet been
made for the funeral, though it is un
derstood that it will be conducted by
Lookout Mountain Post of War Vet
erans, to w,hich he belongs.
"Captain" Kellner fought gallantly
with Grant in the Civil War, and it
was his five yÂ«.ars of fighting that gave
him a taste for the excitement of the
plains. When he quit the life of a
scout he tame to California to live. For
a long time he was in the employ of
James Lick and subsequently he be
came superintendent of the. University
grounds. In this capacity he served
for fourteen years and became known
to every student who attended the uni
versity as a man of generous spirit
and kindliness. He had a fund of sto
ries which seen^ed inexhaustible. Â»
'Captain" Kellner's death was direct
ly due to his self-sacrifice and bravery.
His last illness began with a wound
that he received in an Indian fight
twenty years ago on the plains. A red
skin aimed for a vital spot while--. he
was fighting a band of savages and
death would have ended with a bullet
then had it not been for the soldier's
watch. The bullet struck the watch
and glanced off. thus saving Kellner's
life. But the concussion left a' little
wound and throuph all these years the
old Indian fighter has suffered frequent
pain.
A year or two ago a tumor formed
on the spot where the bullet had struck,
gradually growing until it sapped all
the man's strength. At last it became
so malignant and exhausting that the
doctors decided upon an operation in
the hope of saving their patient's life.
The operation was performed thi3
morning, but the loss of blood that ac
companied it was too great. Two hours
afterward "Captain" Kellner passed
away.
BERKELEY, Aug. 3.â Emil Kellner,
known to alumni and students of the
University of California as "Captain"
Kellner and a familiar figure on the
campus, a man who fought for the
North in the Civil war and for civiliza
tion against the Indians, died at noon
to-day at the Fabiola Hospital, hav
ing succumbed to an operation for a
tumor.

The captured deserter was awakened
this morning by a detective. Roberts
had a headache and felt that he would
have to pay dearly for his escapade,
as he had only finished serving a
thirty day's sentence on bread and
water in the Pensacola's brig.
Roberts wap liberated four days ago.
and last night was on watch at the
time Brigps was doing sentry duty. He
side the ship lay a fccw. O. R. Sm;th,
a s-hlpmate, was consulted, and short
ly after midnight the three slid down
a rope into the tub and shoved off.
It was 2 o'clock when they reached
land and daylight before Roberts had
Imbibed a sufficient quantity of liquor
to make him unable tw navigate. He
was put to bed by his friends, who left
htm. Roberts has been in trouble be
fore. He deserted from the United
States ship Solace and has served a
two years' term in a reformatory at
St. Louis. If they catch Briggs. Rob
erts says, he is apt to get a general
ccrurt-martial. aÂ« he was doing: =entry

If a rehearing is not granted or if
the case goes against them it is prob
able that a case will be taken up
from this county.
Meanwhile the constables In this
county are not letting the grass grow
under their feet, and "vag alley" in the
County Jail is fuller than it has been
for years.
Some of these 200 officials are in
good districts where the "hobo" crop
is large and perennial, but many of
them are compelled to take the drip
pings that come to them from the
trains of the various railroad lines. In
the big railroad centers like Oakland.
Stockton, Fresno, Sacramento and
similar places constables and Justices
would much prefer to be upon a fee
basis, for every tramp is worth from
$4 to $6 according to the mileage that
can be charged against the regular fee
of $4. But there are others who would
rather have the salary basis, and the
majority are of this class.
So the constables and Justices of the
Peace have got together and have em
ployed George A. Sturtevant, Deputy
District Attorney General, and A. F.
St. Sure, and they are going to peti
tion for a rehearing of the decision.
The ca3e upon which the decision was
rendered came from Fresno County,
and the two attorneys have secured
the permission of District Attorney
Jones of that county to ask for a re
opening of the case before the Supreme
Court.
The constables and Justices of the
Peace throughout the State see a re
turn to the old conditions of arresting
'"hobos" In order to make their offices
pay, if the recent decision of the Su
preme Court shall stand.. There are
over 200 constables and Justices of the
Peace in the State, and the indications
are that each and every one of them is
affected by the decision that places
them on a fee basis.

The friends of George E. Randolph,
candidate for Supervisor in the Fifth
District, held a meeting last evening
in the Second Ward. M. P. Manning
presided and Randolph made a state
ment of his position in the contest.
There were addresses by Allan G. Clark
of Berkeley, Jere Tyrrell, Thomas Mur
phy and others.
The Young Men's Republican Club
of the Fiftieth Assembly District was
organized to-night with a roll of fifty
five members.
Several Alameda County names have
been suggested of late, among them
being William R. Davis, Cluy C. Earl
and George W. Heed, though none of
the gentlemen have indicated any in
tention of making a . contest for the
place and several have said that they
could not serve.
The next most important move was
the withdrawal of R. B. Tappan from
the fight for the Republican nomina
tion for Assemblyman from the Forty
seventh District, which is exclusively
in the city of Alameda. There was
a conference between Tappan and some
of his friends last evening, and to-day
he announced his' withdrawal from the
fight. This leaves J. Clem Bates, the
incumbent, without opposition.
The withdrawal of Tappan will not
affect the Senatorial situation in the
fight for the unexpired term of J. R.
Knowland, who will succeed Metcalf in
Congress. Ex-State Senator E. K. Tay
lor arrived from the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado to-day and announced
positively that he waa a candidate for
Senator once more and that he would
contest with W. M. Simpson.
Several now developments took place
in the political situation in Alameda
County to-day. One of the most im
portant was the suggestion of the name
of F. M. Smith, the head of the Key
Route ferry, the Realty Syndicate,
the Oakland Transit Company and the
Pacillc Coast Borax Company, for
Presidential elector on the Republican
ticket. Smith's name was advanced
by several of his friends while he was
in the East, but it was announced posi
tively that he would not accept the
place.

School Superintendent S. D. "Water
man has reports from the schools that
show a big increase in the enrollment
since the schools ooened, In spite of
the order from the State Board of
Health requiring all children to be vac
cinated. The Superintendent estimates
that there will be some 250 new pupils.
Dr. Woodson W. Allen, president of
the Board of Education, nays that he
will resign from the board at the next
meeting if the other members insist
upon applying the vaccination law in
the schools. Dr. Allen Intimated when
the board met last night that he would
resign on this account. But to-day he
flat-footedly announced that he would
withdraw after the next meeting un
less in the meantime his colleagues
modify .their position, a contingency
which he very much doubts.
"I am not opposed so much to vac
cination as I am to the law that com
pels it," said Dr. Allen last night. "I
consider it an Infringement ur>on the
liberties of the people. It is forcing
them to take what they do not want.
All have a right to their opinions, and
if they oppose vaccination they should
be entitled to act according to their
judgment, not according to a set of
lawmakers."

or $222,222. has been paid by the
Whitney executors. The present ap
peal Is to have the collection of a 1

aside, because the act under which it
was made is declared unconstitutional,

Pardee, accompanied by his wife and
two daughters, returned this after
noon from an extended Eastern trip.
The Governor expressed high appre
ciation of the value of the California
exhibit at the St. Louis Exposition.
He declared that while other States
sought to excel In corn, California
surpassed them not only In that but
in all other products.
The Governor spoke of his visit to
President Roosevelt at Oyster Bay as
a pleasant experience. The President,
he said, referred feelingly to his re
ception by California on his visit to
the coast last year and said Califor
nians would always retain a warm
place in his heart.

CALIFORNIA'S DISPLAY
IS PRAISED BY PARDEE
SAUSALITO, Aug. 3.â Fred Marriott,
editor of a San Francisco weekly
paper, was arrested this morning by a
deputy marshal for refusing to pay his
annual street^ poll tax.
Marriott's arrest was the outcome of
the recent ordinance passed by the
Board of Trustees of the town of Sau
salito which compels every male Inhab
itant of the town of Sausalito to pay
an annual street poll tax of 51.
Marriott appeared before Judge Pry
or. The case was postponed until next
Saturday and Marriott was released on
his own recognizance. The Trusteas
have engaged Henry McPike of San
Francisco and George Harlan of San
Rafael to act as special counsel.
W. J. Martin, a member of the Sau
salito Board of Trustees, stated to-day
that the recent action of the board
with reference to the enforcement of
the ordinance levying a road tax of one
dollar on every male inhabitant is a
step that has two objects in view.- One
is to repair and put in order the boule
vard or shore road, the principal thor
oughfare, which connected the munici
pality with the Government reserva
tion â a thoroughfare that had been al
most completely destroyed by last win
ter's storms. The other is to levy a
tax upon a certain clr.ss who never pay
any taxes of any kind or character. It
Is from this class, if from any, that
the chief opposition to the ordinance is
expected to come.
Martin also remarked that the "Legis
lature of the State had placed the pow
er to pass and enforce such an ordi
nance in the Board of Trustees, and
that the x board had taken able counsel
and meant to sustain their action If it
could be done. Also that /while it was
the duty of the taxpayer to go to the
town marshal to pay hia tax. never
theless, for convenience to the taxpayer,
the town marshals had been instructed
to make collections, and to act with
courtesy and civility and^to report no
one unless an absolute refusal and de
fiance of the law was met with.
The board will enforce the ordinance
unless passed on adversely by the
courts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The other eighteen policemen made a
charge on the crowd. This time tho'on
slaught was in earnest, eighteen clubs
being swung from right to left with
all the muscle that the men could ren
der, and fully fifty rioters were beaten
to the pavement in this manner before
they showed any signs of scattering.
While admitting that the packers
are doing considerable business, the
strike leaders declare that the employ
ers are !c-sing money on every animal
that is slaughtered, as the unskilled
workers wasUj all the by-products. It
is on this waste that the strikers base
their hopes for final success.
In a riot that broke out at the yards
to-night two policemen were injured
and twenty-eight rioters were arrested
after being beaten into submission.
The riot started when five strike
breakers from one of the machine
shops In one of the packing plants
were leaving the yards and tried to
board a street car to go to their homes.
Despite the signals of the strike break
ers the motormen on twelve cars re
fused to stop and a crowd, seeing a
good opportunity to get revenge on the
non-union men, began to hurl stones at
them. Two policemen who were guard
ing the entrance went to the assistance
of the non-union men. but the rioters
by this time had grown in numbers so
rapidly that fully a thousand angry
men were trying to get at the strike
breaker?. Retreating into the machine
shop, the police sent in a riot call for
reinforcements. When the additional
policemen arrived a charge was made
on the rioters. The crowd mado an as
sault with bricks and stones and when
the policemen started forward every
man who could find room fought with
his brick. Two bricks went true to the
mark and two policemen dropped with
wounds on the head. They were car
ried by their companions to the ma
chine shop.
CHICAGO. Aug. 3.â The threatened
spread erf the stockyards strike to out
side industries came to-night, when an
order was Issued by the Teamsters'
Union forbidding drivers of ice wag
ons to make any deliveries to retail
butchers who, since the packing-house
teamsters went on strike, have been
hauling meat from ths yards in their
own wagons. As the refrigerators in
most markets do not hold enough ice
to last lonser than forty-eight hours,
the order to cut ot'E the supply of ice,
if it can be forced, means that many
persons in Chicago will be compelled
to forego fresh meat. Officers at the
Teamsters' Union have appointed pick
ets to watch the retail markets
throughout Chicago, with instructions
to see that the boycott is carried out.
With their new employes and those
that have deserted the unions the
packers managed to dispose of fully
50 per cent as much work as is car
ried on under normal conditions.
Fewer than 300 new employes arrived
;it the various plants to-day. Tha
packers declare that the reason for
the small addition to their forces was
that they were about thro-ugh hiring
v. orkmen and were now choosing only
skilled men.
Stockyards Plants Are Be
ing Operated at Fifty Per
Cent of Their Full Capacity
Bonding" Town to Supply
Keservoirs oh an Elevation
The Proposed Plan Involves
The sprinkling problem has been a
severe one. It takes three or four horses
to haul up the grades a sprinkling cart
containing but 400 gallons. The town
is unable to employ more than one cart.
The plant that is proposed to supply
salt water would also be available for
fresh water whenever a sufficient sup
ply of fresh water could be obtained.
The shutting off at night is ner essary
that provision may be made in rough
the dry season. Unless the water is
economised there must be a great sum
mer shortage. The watfr supply ques
tion has been agitated for some time,
but without practical result.
Recently the Trustees of Sausalito
bought a small chemical engine and or
ganized a volunteer flre company to
handle it at fires. There is in Sausalito
a salt water pumping engine that is
available for use on the front of the
town. The hill has no protection ex
cept such as may be offered by the
â¢ homicRl engine. Considering that it
requires some time to get the chemical
engine to a tire on the hill and that
this engine is useful principally at the
beginning of a fire, to quell the flames
in their incipiency, it has been appar
ent that other means must be had.
Under the present circumstances a
fire on the hi'J when the wind is blow
ing is certain to be disastrous. Lately
the Gaston Ashe residence was
burned. Luckily the fire took place on
a stlH night when there was no wind.
The chemical engine, the use. of sacks
and the cutting away of fences with
ax^s. prevented the adjoining proper
ties from taking fire.
The public meeting of this evening
was called to discuss the plan of bond
ing the town for the purpose of erect
ing tanks for a salt water supply for
the hil!; to run pipes from the tanks
along the terraces, with faucets "at
convenient places for hose in case of
fire and also for sprinkling the ter
races.
The Trustees wished to gst the senti
ment of the people and declined fcp ptu
c*ed until they had assurance that the
movement would be indorsed. There
txists a condition of aliairs that is per
ilous to the welfare of the town, i'nere
is absolutely no real protection for ths
property on the hill against fire in the
night. The water supply is shut off
every night at 9 o'clock and : s not
turned eriajjuiii until o o'clock in i- >
morning.
SAUSALITO. Aug. 3.â A meeting of
the citizens of Sausalito was held this
evening in the Town Hall, at which
the question of bonding the town to
provide a water supply for the protec
tion of the hiil districts of Sausalito
was considered. George Storey was
elected chairman. The following com
mittee was ejected to present pians and
specifications to the Town Trustees,
embodying the scheme to bond the
town: J. M. Kiigairiff. Captain t. C.

The Italian American Bank of San
Francisco, although not a party to to
day's action, has filed a formal protest
with the Secretary of State against the
grant of a charter to the Italian Bank
of California, the protest likewise being
based on the alleged . similarity of
names.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 3.â The Bank
of California is the plaintiff in an in
teresting action brought late this af
ternoon against Secretary of State
Charles F. Curry.
An institution styled the Italian
Eank of California, with San Fran
cisco as Its place of business, applied
to the Secretary of State this after
noon for a charter. Before the request
could be granted, the Secretary of
State was served with papers on behalf
of the Bank of California of San Fran
cisco, In an action of injunction.
The matter came up before Judge
Hughes in the Superior Court, who is
sued a temporary restraining order,
returnable Friday next. The Bank of
California's suit is based on the claim
that the similarity of its name with
that of the new concern is prejudicial
to its interests.

A WONDERFUL CURE
OF RHEUMATISM
I tell you thnt when one Is compelled
to stand on ones feet most of the day, if
there is any rheumatism In the system
it is pretty likely to show up in the feet.
Well, tiiis is what It did In my case. I
had suffered off and on with rheumatism
for a pood many years. I took all kinds
oi medicines. I rubbed all kinds of lini-
ments. My stomach became weak from
sv/allowSng medicines, yet the rheuma-
tism kept on getting worse. Finally It
grot into my feet and ankles. The feet
and ankles became swollen and painful,
so that I could hardly stand on them. It
looked as If 1 would have to give up my
position with %he Domestic. Sewing: Ma-
chine Company. 1021 Market street,
where I have been employed for a good
many years. I did not wish,, to give up
my position, so I decided to take the
Electro-Chemic treatment, for I â¢ had
heard that this new treatment never
fails In rheumatism. I took the Electro-
Chemic treatment at the Institute. US
Grant avenue, and in five weeks, at a
very little expense, I was thoroughly
cured. My name Is Mrs. Mary Richards
and I live at 213 Shotwell strceL Con-
sultation and examination free at the
Flectro-Chemic Institute, and I surely
advise all sufferers to consult the Elec-
tro-Chemic specialists before taking
heaps of*-nasty medicines, which in all
probability will never cure them.,-

tal, for the Tigers kept plodding: along
till finallv they tied up the score in
the seventh. They won out in the
eighth, when Casey stole home while
Thielman was "winding up.". Thiel
man was replaced by Hastings, who
lined out a double in the ninth inning,
but died at second base. The score:

One hour and 40 minutes. Umpire â McCarthy.
The miner was slightly bitten by his
pet bear yesterday. While playing
with the animal it caught him on the
hand and left the marks of its teeth
there and also drew a little blood.
Jack is thus early qualifying for the
championship by following in the foot
steps of Jeffries.
Twin Sullivan' again donned the
mitts and went a couple of lively
rcunds with Jack. When he had fin
ished with Sullivan the miner took on
Andy Gallagher to wind up the day's
work. Andy sailed in and made it
lively for a round.
Harry Chester, the big heavy-weight
from the Olympic Club, was the first
to face the miner and the pair mixed
it for two rounds. Chester was shifty
â¢and the miner worked up a good
perspiration following him around.
Seme good punches were landed by
both men. though Munroe went rather
easy with the amateur.
Corporal of Police Ed Ward is the
idol of the hour with the fair sex. In
some manner the bear, that is kept in
captivity, broke out of his cage and
went on a tour of investigation. There
is nothing particularly vicious about
the animal, but the women were some
what nervous. Ward, always gallant,
volunteered to put the bear back in
his cage. Pinning on his star, the
doughty cop approached Mr. Bear, but
the animal did not seem disposed to
make friends, A happy thought struck
Ed and he hastened to put it into exe
cution. He proceeded to tell the beat*
one of his famous stories of life on the
frontier. Bruin became so exhausted
from laughing that* he was unable to
offer any resistance and was easily put
back in the cage.
Jack Munroe spent a busy day at
the beach yesterday. After "his run
in the morning he rested and entered
the gymnasium in the afternoon, feeling
ready for work. He punched the two
baps and worked the machines for a
while and then felt like taking on his
spurring partners.
No time was lost In getting back to
work and the champ was up with the
feathered folk this morning for road
work. Brother Jack in a cart cut out
the pace and Jeff ran three miles at a
good clip. Upon returning a bath and
rubdown completed the morning's
work. Jeffs wind js vastly improved
and he came in from his, run in good
condition. Perspiration is free and
there will be no troub!e in taking off
any superfluous flesh that may have
accumulated during his illness.
The usual gymnasium work occupied
several hours this afternoon but no
boxing was indulged in. The big 350
pound sandbag is a favorite form of
exercise with Jeff.
HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 3.â Jeffries
returned from his hunting trip last
night after an absence of two days.
He failed to make connection with any
big game and the venison appetite the
guests had developed will not be satis
fied. The big fellow is in excellent con
dition and if It were not for the -ban
dage he wears he would hardly be able
to tell which knee had caused him'
trouble.

SAN JOSE, Aug. 3.â The races of the
sixteenth annual meeting of the Pa
cific Coast Trotting-horse Breeders'
Association, which opened to-day,
were the best ever witnessed here.
There was a fair attendance and much
interest was displayed in the various
heats. The day was fine and the track
; in good condition. Prominent racing
men and breeders from various points
on the coast were present. The $14,700
which is to be given in purses during
the four days' meet has attracted the
best light harness horses on the coast.
Two favorites won to-day. Billy Red,
the favorite in the 2:20 pace, was
beaten by Rajah. The ill luck that
has followed the starting of the latter
was broken at last. He had been
beaten in twelve races ~ ,

SARATOGA, Aug. 3.â The chief at
traction to-day was the $15,000 Spin
away stakes for two-year-old fillies.
H. B. Duryea's stable had three rep
resentatives, declaring to win with
Tanya, which won the National Stal
lion stakes at Morris Park and has not
appeared since. The other two start
ers carrying Mr. Duryea's colors were
Heart's Desire and Iota.
The start was perfect and after a
hundred, yards Tanya began to draw
away. At the end of a furlong Schu
malite, which had an inside position,
dropped back and Tanya and Heart's
Desire became first and second. There
is no doubt now that Tanya was best
and she came on and won cleverly
though Shaw was somewhat afraid
both Schumalite and Linda Lee, which
were closing fast, might get up to his
mount and he took no chances. Mr.
Duryea won $11,000 first money, but
was disappointed in not running second
and third, as some thought he might
do. Summary:

In the first race in Petit Due, a colt
by Kingston, which he brought recent

formances few could concede him a
chance, except the knowing ones, who
backed him from 7 to 1 to 5 to 1 at
post time. The colt led all the way.
Capitanzo, favorite at 9 to 5, backed
from 2 to 1, ran a dismal race and was
never a contender. The track wag fast,

CHICAGO, Aug. 3.â Ram's Horn, at a
long price, came near upsetting all cal
culations in the third race, which was
the feature event to-day at Harlem.
The colt showed a marvelous burst of
speed, leading his field by a good mar
gin all the way until within a few
yards of the wire, where Lady Savoy,
the odds-on choice, came with a rush,
barely winning by a neck. The race
was supposed to be between Lady
Savoy, Flaxman and The Mist, but
the friends of Larry Curtis backed
Ram's Horn from 20 to 16. Lady Savoy
was heavily played at post time, forc

The Board of State Harbor Com
missioners of San Francisco evidently
believes in tempering business with,
mercy and giving its employes as
much latitude (with longitude thrown
in) as possible in the matter of deal-
Ing with derelictions from duty caused
from too frequent lunching among" the
v-ater front resorts. This charitable
spirit was shown in the folowing reso
lution adopted at the regular meeting
of that body yesterday:
Resolved, That all employes of the operating
department of the Belt Railroad, while on duty,
are prohibited from drinking intoxicating
liquors or beins in an intoxicated condition.
AU trainmen whose carelessness or neglect of
duty is a cause of accident to persona or
property are liable to a suspension of ten days
or more: when the time of Â¦ suspensions ex
ceeds elxty days in one year the employe is
subject to dismissal.

cover the actual cost of cutting the
wires, and that these bonds were ac
cepted with their sureties by the com
pany. Therefore an effort will be made
to hold the company to the agreement.
It aDDears that the housemovers in
Los Angeles are confronted with the
same problem of opposition by the
owners of wires, and Mr. Sooy has re
ceived word that the contractors there
will join with the San Francisco mov
ers in carrying the case to a final de
cision in the Supreme Court. The sit
uation in Oakland Is the same and
the fight promises to be a vigorous one.
In the case of the United Railroads
against D. J. Sullivan and other house
movers, Superior Judge Murasky has
vacated his order of July 7 modifying
the order of June 23, in which he re
fused to enjoin the housemovers from
cutting the wires or crossing the tracks
of the railroad company, but required
the defendants to give a bond to pay
the exDenses of cutting the wires un
der the direction of the company.
The modifying order of July 7 pro
vided that the former order should not
act as an estoppel against either of
the parties. It was made without no
tice to the railroad company and, an
objection to its provisions was raised
with the result that it was revoked.
The attorneys for the company yes
terday notified the housemovers that
their bond, given under the modified
order, was insufficient and a new bond
would be demanded.

Hustling. Modern Journalism. '
THE most appalling instance of human greed ever
disclosed is that of the Knickerbocker Steamboat
Company in New 'York City. It overloaded the
Slocum with an excursion'vvhen its fire hose and life pre
servers were rotten, its crew a lot of ignorant louts and
its captain an incompetent, and sent a thousand people
to a dreadful death. But what touched the whole world
to the quiclcmade no impression upon the greedy ghouls
who owned the boat. They obstructed, as much as they
dared,^the disclosure of facts that would put responsi
bility'upon them, and tried to pass the" slaughter as one
of those incidents of risk on the water that foresight can
nof prevent and courage cannot mitigate.
But.this is not all. The company has had the sister
boat of the Slocum constantly in commission as an ex
cursion boat, carrying thousands of people on outings
around the bay, and when the special Federal inspectors
desired to overhaul her the company refused to lay her
off/ for that purpose. officials were compelled to
board her as passengers and conduct an inspection while
fthe was loaded with human freight.. They found the life
preservers and fire hose rotten, the life boats and rafts
incapable of living a moment in the water, and the
whole craft a death trap, even more dangerous than the
Slocum.' When the captain was asked to sound the bell
for a fire drill of the crew he did not know what'it meant
nor did the crew. No man knew anything about a sta
tion or co-operation in time of peril. They were of the
same class as manned the Slocum.
This is something that almost passes b*elief,. and it.
: would not be credited were it not in an official report.
When the Iroquois Theater burned every theater owner
â¢ in "the country understood that his self-interest required
thathe make his place safe, and this feeling was not con

Xompany, withjthe blood of a thousand on its grasping
hands, was not impressed by its awful crime, buf-went on
in the way of committing another. The law should

Christmas came, but instead of "Con"
going up to $300 it fell to $25. The man
was a pauper. In lamenting his loss
he incidentally mentioned to a frie'nd
of Flood's how he lost his all. Flood,
who was generous to a fault, sent for
Hank and had him repeat his story.
When he learned of his chance re
mark about "Con going to 300 before
Christmas" he fairly shook with laugh
ter, and explained what it meant.
It was in reference to the gift of a
young sow, made a present to him by
"Con" O'Connor, who, for the fun of
the thing, had called the pig "Con."
The bet alluded to the sow's increasing
in weight to 300 pounds before Christ
mas and not to Con. Virginia.
Having enjoyed the joke and after
joshing Hank the noble-hearted Flood
bought back the ranch for Hank and
recompensed him for all his losses. The
originality of the joke and the knowl
edge of the penalty paid by an eaves
dropper was Flood's reward.

Moscow's Magic Croze.
The' cvclone which raged around
Moscow on June 2J, causing great loss
of life and tremendous damage to
property, was a storm such as is sel
dom seen in Russia. At intervals hail
of unusual size fellâ some stones as
large as a hen's eggâ and the wir.d
blew with terrific force.
Almost the first that suffered was
the historical Annenhoffsky Grove,
which eye-witnesses say v.as leveled
to the ground as if by word of com
mand. This grove was called into be*
ing bv the Empress Anna. One day;
from her balcony she remarked^

A GREAT responsibility Â¦-, rests upon the Panama
Canal Commission. In addition to the task of*
constructing an interoceanic canal for the free
passage of the commerce of the world by the short route
between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, they will soon
administer the Jpanama railway. This, short road con
nects at â¢both ends with steamship lines, and the company
operating the sole line of .steam vesssels between the
isthmus of Panama and the Pacific Coast of the United
States has for many years been so managed as to be
auxiliary to the plans of the transcontinental railways.
The interest of the latter has been and still is to carry
all the transcontinental freights between the Atlantic
and Pacific seaboards of the United States. To pre
vent any interference with their projects they have had
practical control of the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany's operatipns between the designated points. Rates
by the sea line have been made such that they have not
interfered with the railways. The latter has had the trans
portation of freights as a monopoly for the greater bulk
and for nearly all classes. The people of the Pacific
Coast have been compelled to accept, their terms.
The United States Government now owns sixty-nine
seventieths of the .stock of the Panama Railway Com
pany and has three out of thirteen directors. The ad
vantage to commerce that will follow the opening of the
Panaeia canal is the free use of the sea to all comers.
The United States Go\'ernmcnt is about to control the
Panama railway. This road, used in conjunction with all
carriers by sea, and thrown open to all who wish to use
it forjthe movements of commerce, on even terms, and
without discrimination in favor of or against any car
rier, is the key to much that will relate to commerce in
the immediate future. It can be used practically in lieu
of the canal until the latter is completed and opened.
Freights in both directions, the products of California
and general merchandise of all sorts, can be given a
chance very soon to move to market at the lowest rates.
The boon that the canal may confer is only greater than
tliat residing in the proper use of the Panama railway
by the Government. . "",
President Roosevelt has addressed a communication
to the members of the Panama Canal Commission, ev
pressing a desire that no contract between the Panama
Railway Company and any. transportation line against
public policy shall be renewed. As the canal can never
be given over to the exclusive use of any transportation
company 'as a matter of public policy, it is difficult to
see how the present . opportunity to encourage com
merce and to promote the use of the vessels of the
merchant marine of the United States can be set aside
for the benefit of any combination of railways and
steamship lines as against free use by the people.
It is, however, reported on good authority from Wash
ington that the Panama Canal Commission will decide,
while they are on the isthmus, for which the Commis
sioners have recently, set sail, what shall be done about
the contract between the Panama railway and the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company. The Commissioners
representing the United States Government as directors
of the Panama railway now number but three. There
are thirteen directors altogether. How the ten who
are not representative of the United States will act is
uncertain. Hence the situation is very interesting. A
grave responsibility exists.
A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.

In the old days of excitement, when
mining stocks were on the Jump and
men became millionaires over one
day's dabbling, an Incident' occurred at
the country residence of James C.
Flood in Menlo, when a fairly well-to
do resident found himself without a
home In the short period of one week.
The man's name was Hank, and, be
ing a first-class gardener, he readily
found employment about the residences
of the wealthy owners of mansions.
In this way he was employed at the
Flood residence. Hank was loitering
about the garden one Saturday even
ing as the proprietor, fa company with
a visitor, was looking over the stock.
Mr. Flood, who had just stepped out
of the hos corral, casually remarked
to his friend that he would be willing
to make a bet that "Con would go up
to .300 before Christmas." Hank con
structed "con" to mean Consolidated
Virginia, and, taking the tip which
he thought would make him a
millionaire, he disposed of his holding
of 250 acres of fine land, his stock and.

scathed. This because that man has behind him the
weight of a moral power such as few Governments pos

Tolstoy certainly speaks thus to the great hurt- of
his Government. His sentiments are the reflection of.
those of thousands of peasants, who 'see sons and fath- s
ers taken away to fight for a land they mayhap have"
never heard of and to die before the bullets of men
they have never known. Tolstoy's philosophy is the
peasants' philosophy: it needs no great study for them
to be admitted to his faith, for it is their faith. When,
therefore, the great teacher oLa Christ-like love and
Christ-like life inveighs against the brutalities and insani
ties of the Czar's war his words will carry a thrill to
the very backbone of the country itseif.

The forlorn condition of the cat is
atracting the attention of w.ell-disposed
persons in London, who recently held
a well-attended meeting and unanim
ously Dassed a resolution to invite the
Chancellor of the Exchequer to consid
er a proposition to tax cats as a meas
ure likely to promote the welfare of
the domestic Det and increase the as
sets of the British empire. One of the
speakers urged that every argument
offered against the time-honored dog
tax, which was first levied in 1796, could
be brought against a cat tax.. He es
timated that such a tax .would produce
Â£2,500,00() a year, -and while it might
eliminate the many it would give "a
higher social rank tb the few.", From
his investigations it appeared that cat
owners in the country, favored a tax,
but an Essex farmer, took the highly
economic view that a cat tax would
add hundreds a year to -the burdens of
agriculturists, as vermin would increase
and multiply if the cat population, were
diminished to evade the tax gatherer.
The movement- seems to have substan
tial support, inasmuch as it is conduct

Thus does Count Leo Tolstoy characterize his sov
ereign, the Czar of Russia, in a recent issue of that
arch enemy of Russia, the London Times. % Nor does
he halt at lese majeste in his f ulminations against the
iniquity of the present war. A 1 " judiciary much more
lenient than that of Russia would construe treason out
of the following utterance of the apostle of peace:
"So that to this question as to what is to be done
now, when war is commenced, for me, a man who under-'
stands his destination, whatever position I may occupy,
there can be* no other answer than this, whatever be
my circumstances, whether the war be commenced or
i?ot, whether^thousands of Russians or Japanese be
killed, whether not only Port Arthur "be taken, but St.
Petersburg and Moscow^-I cannot act otherwise than
as God commands of me, and that therefore I, as a man,
can neither directly nor indirectly, neither by direct
ing nor by helping, nor by inciting to it, participate in the
war; I cannot, I do not wish to, and I will not."
Tolstoy has said these things and not a hand has
been raised against him, no Cossack band has been sent
to. drag him from his retreat into court and the final
oblivion of Siberia. Had a student at Moscow or an
artisan in. the shops at Cronstadt but- dared to whisper
such a sentiment. in the\ privacy of his own closet he
would ere this be on his way across the Ural Mountains

It was built a little over one hundred
â¢ years ago for Lord Henry Seymour,
but the architect, Henry Wyatt, was
the best of his day and designed Apsley
House, the Duke cf Wellington's fa
mous London residence. Towered and
': embattled, Norris Castle is a perfect
S replica of a Norman castle and com
plete in every detail. It is not one of
. those- whopping big feudal piles,
I . planned to accommodate an army of
retainers and where a guide is needed
to pilot one around, but it is amply
large enough for modern requirements
and entertainments, containing -some
thirty rooms and a lofty hall, forty-six
by fourteen feet. The estate covers
150 acres and upon it are a couple of
picturesque lodges â one of them in the
fornV of a round Norman tower â and
several cottages, stabling and farm
buildings. It adjoins the royal domain
â¢of Osborne and was for a time the

Where justice is principles flourish; where there is un
selfishness and due regard Jor all rights the party that
enforces that sentiment does not have to wait long for
the vigor which it inspires. The material and political
interests of Northern California do not require two Sen
ators. They arc amply and wefl supplied now with rep
resentatives in the State and National governments.
Every interest in Southern California does need the Sen
ator. To deny it is to injure them and affront the peo
ple. The Republican party cannot afford to do it, and
we are persuaded that.it will not do what it cannot afford
to do. '
. In the last State election the general majority was
large, but the Governor had a narrow margin. Every
member of the party appreciates the importance of his
election and the benefit of the excellent administration
he has given to the State. It has everywhere increased
the vigor of the party and has strengthened its hold upon
the people. This has not come of mere control of the
patronage, but from the character of the administration
in its relation to all of the public interests. It is the
duty of the party to remember this- and to be guided by
a policy of justice toward every section of the State that
abided by public duty and made the present inspiring
situation possible.
In the last State election Southern California cast
close "to 40.000 Republican votes out of a total of 146,332
cast for Governor in the whole State. We by no means
base our whole argument for. a Senator from Southern
California on that vote, but it is' a factor that weighs very
appreciably. This is a big State, nearly one thousand
miles in length. It covers so much latitude that its two
extremes may well have individual interests and aspira
tions to be served in the United States Senate. We all
know exactly how we would feel if Southern California
had the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, one Senator
and a member of the President's Cabinet, and then
should demand the other Senator also. We all know
that such a demand would raise a storm that would bi
sect the party, turn it into two angry and rival camps
and endanger its supremacy in the State. The appalling
consequences, from a party standpoint, would not be
overcome in a generation.
It is an excellent rule in politics to put yourself in the
other man's place and soberly determine how you would
feel there. Putting Northern California in the place of
Southern California in this matter decides the question
at once in favor of choosing the Senator from the South.
It is a rapidly growing section of the State. As it has
grown its Republican vote has grown. The immigration
and the enterprise' it has domesticated there are largely
Republican. Throughout that region are strong men in
the party, and being strong they cannot be expected to
submit to outlawry from their just rights. .
. It is not saying too much to say that in this Presiden
tial year the party vote will be greatly increased by the
immediate, frank and friendly fellowshipping of South
ern California in the matter of the Senatorship. Noth
ing else, can produce such a pleasant condition of good'
will in the w r hole party, and nothing else can more power
fully conduce to its symmetrical growth throughout the
State.
THE campaign for the Senatorship is being carried
on openly and aboveboard as is proper and credit
able to all the aspirants. The Call has no candidate
to urge upon the people. - A choice made from the pres
ent field Would satisfy the pride and the aspirations of
the State and secure an honorable representative in the
Senate. The Republican party is incapable of submis
sion to covert manipulation and will not permit the smell
of smoke on the toga -of a Senator. The position -of the
State has risen to a plane of too much importance to
permit inferior representation or the selection of any
man who has not a clear escutcheon.
These being the circumstances, and the party proving
to be rich in material, its plain duty is to see that justice
is done to itself and to the State by. a proper and equit
able distribution of the, honors and burdens of office and
representation so as to give all of the peopMe and all sec
tions a fair share according to their merit and their ser
vice. - , '. '-J.

XO CRI3IE CODITTTEn).
Manifestly the enteri-j Jcto suca a scheme
WQuld be a conssiracy to defraud the States
of California and Oresor, but it ia d:f2cuJt to
understand u^oq what theory it can be held
t* b* a "ccusi'iracy to commit ac^' cJIenae
against the United States." â¢ â¢ â¢ When
patented sviicol lands are calces by the Called I
Stares for ota*r ianda wjMch constitute a I
valuable consideration, the Government ac- I
Qtures a perfect title to such school lazds. It ]
was ccnccd-d en the arrs^ent aad en the I
brief that the title obtained by a patentee j
cannot be attacked collaterally for frauds '
practi-^d la obtainlnr It. Tte United States, i
therefor*, assumlna tHat the al!esÂ»d con- '
spJracy were ccnsrumroaTed. would have ob
tained for tfcÂ» State patentee of school lands
a i>er;ec! till- In excharje for its cwa -va
cast, sunrey#>-i and CGn-rnineral public lands
which are sutject to hom.estea<i eiitry." With
the inethoiis ty which tie patentee acquired
his title free the State it had no cenc-m; if
State laws were violated and the public laws
cf tile State fraudulently evaded it ovay be as
sumed that the State would puniah the of
fender. â¢ â¢ â¢ All that th-e United States
wanted was a rood title. Where a claim was
enperfected It would be necessary to ascertain
what had been done to irakÂ« it fruitful: where
a cattrnt had issued all such Inquiry would NÂ»
unnecessary. The conspiracy charge, as was
said before, did cot centetr.r-late the offerinc
ia exchange for outside lands of any public
â¢chcol lancis except such as axe covered by pat
ect. â¢ â¢ â¢
Upon thÂ» broadest construction which can
fce KiWn to the indictment It does not set fcrth
facts tendlns to show a conspiracy ta commit
a_ny cSTense arainst. or to fiÂ»fraud, the United
State*, and the petitioner should, therefore, be
discharged. Should the District Attorney de
sire to take an arseal. the petitioner will be
required durinj its pendency to rive ball la
; the amount firtd when this proceeding was In
stituted.
HENEY CRITICIZES JUDGE.
Francis J. Heney, "who represented
I the Government as special counsel In
i the Hyde-Dimond hearing be'ore Com
missioner Heacock. said last evening
I that the case for the prosecution had
i not been fully presented to the court
: cr not clearly understood by It. Mr.
Heney continued:
Judge La^cmbe tears a very hith reputation
as a lawyer, and If his opinion correctly states
Use law it necessarily fellows that both Hyd?
and Dlmcnd must be dischar?Â»(J, and that no
one of tie parties Involved in the ccnsplracy
set forth is th* Indictment can b< punished.
Moreover, tney can continue with impunity to
bribe forest Â»urerviscrÂ» and Inspectors said
can excharre with the United States for Ita
best homestead and timber lands still remain
ing vacant oatside cf forest reserves about
200,000 acres of school lands belocjrlng to tha
Staxe of California, for which application baa
already been made by them through dummies.
But & casual readinr of Judge Leoombe's
opinion discloses tf'e fact that it contains in
ternal evidence of a hasty and imoerfect ccn
aideratiOB cf the point* :nadÂ« by the Govern
ment.

"These are real people." Everybody
who has seen Cucuel's pictures, now
on exhibition at Schu5sler Bros.' gal
lery, says that. The figures appear
to stand out from the bristol board,
and the groups are so natural that
they seem to move.
A grilmpse at the work takes one
far away tc* France or Germany. So
finely worked Is every detail that on*
almost hÂ«?ars the nasal twang of the
lingua Franca or the gutturals of the
German 4 language. Uhlan ofiicers,
foreign Embassadors. gendarmes,
stout Teutonic women and slim
French girls seem Just about to leave
thÂ» frames and step down to the car
pet of the exhibition room.
Edward Cucuel was at one time a
member of The Call art staff. For
seven year3 he has been studying in
Europe. A thorough cosmopolitan by
instinct, he flitted from city to city
through France, Germany and Switz
erland, stopping at will when attract
ed by siehts suited to his pencil and
brush.
He is a master draughtsman, quick
and sure In his work. Unfinished
sketches in the gallery show how
rapidly and simply he works. A few
pencil lines and then the brush wield
ed by a hand that "knows how,"
The sketch, "The Salon Poet." Is
a wonderful cartoon. It shows a
simpering poet in the midst of an ex
ceedingly bored assemblage. Only one
In the crowd is at all attracted by
the gush the poet disburses as he
twirls a daisy in his slender hands.
The role "kindred spirit" ia an at
tenuated woman poet, who stands In
the background with her hands clasp
ed adoringly. The expressions are
only too human. This work alone
would give the artist claim to fame.
The study "A Gendarme; Place de la
Republique. Paris," with a Cooks' tour
ist interrogating, is another bit from
real life. Cucuefv handles coior well.
He expects to leave soon for the Ori
ent, where he will draw war scenes.
In the case at bar the Merchants*
Bank of San Die^o lent the Esr?ondido
irrigriilon district 5330,000 and took
a trust deed to the witer rights of the
borrower. The property of the dis
trict v.as seized in default of the pay
ment of interest op. the loan and suit
was brought to quiet title. The di
rectors of the district argaed that the
Wright act was unco;astitutional and
both the lower court and the Supreme
Court acquiesce in that view. The
payment of; the loan may be secured
by assessments.
The court holds that th- measure
Is in violation of the Federal provi
sions granting that -n person shall
be â¢ â¢ deprived of â¢â¢ â¢ prop
erty without due process of law" and
directing that no State shall enact a
"Maw impairing the obligation cf con
tracts."
The Supreme Court handed doxrn a
decision yesterday declaring invalid
section 17 of what is known as the
V.'right act. Th!s law provides that
beards of directors of irrigation di.^
trict.s may borrow money for improve
ments ar.d give aa security mortgages
or trust dÂ«eda on their water rights.
Thus a majority of the voters or the
district may place a lien on the prop
erty of every citizen in the jurisdic
tion.

Point in Regard to Loans
Among the merry group is one who
will soon become a bride herself â Miss
Edith Findley, who on August 20, will
wed George Gardiner.
About seventy guests witnessed the
ceremony, and attended the reception
that followed.
The honored guests who dined at the
bride's table were: Miss Carrie Merry.
Tom Van Ness. Mr. and Mrs. Ed
Schmiedell. Captain and Mrs. Harold
Coke. Dr. and Mrs. Garceau, Miss Ger
trude Hyde-Smith. Mr. Moffitt, Miss
Edith Findley, Herbert Martin, tliss
Constance Borrowe and Milton Lath
am. ?:â¢'â¢Â¥?
She was attended by Miss Carrie
Merry of New York, who wore a strik
ing gown of white lace over white chif
fon, the effect of which was borne out
by a beautiful white plumed hat.
Thomas C. Van Ness served as best
man.
Not a dozen blocks away, another
maid was plighting her love to the man
of her choopinsâ Miss Camiiio Martin,
she of the old Hyde family, whose his
tory is closely interwoven with the up
building of the city.
At the hour of three. Miss Martin be
came the bride of "William Palmer
Horn, Archbishop Montgomery offici
ating. The? service was performed at
the old family home on Geary street,
which, in the old days, was the scene
of many a smart affair. Â£â¢>â¢'.-?
The home was made glad with ferns
and yellow roses, Woodwardia. and
Banksia blossoms making a rare set
ting for the bride and her attendant.
Gowned in white crepe de Paris, with
a rare lace bertha and flounce, and en
veloped in a mass of filmy tulle. Miss
Martinâ always prettyâ was exquisite
in her bridal array.
The destination of the young Sutros
is said to be the Eastern citiesâ New
York and Washington, particularly; a
short visit across the line, and a trip
over the Great Lakes.
The young people will be located at
2503 Broadway on their return.
Among the interesting guests at the
wedding were the brother and newly
acquired sister of the brideâ Mr. and
Mrs. Joseph O'Sullivan, who hava but
recently arrived from Paris.
Whispers come from over the waters
that this young chap Is pressing close
upon the honors of his famous brother,
Denis, the sweet singer.
The ceremony was read by Arch
bishop Montgomery, at the home of
Archbishop Riordan, only the relatives
of the happy pair witnessing the. im
pressive service. Mr. Sutro was at
tended by his brother, Alfred Sutro.
The bride, a stunning young woman,
was simply gowned in pale gray, wear
ing a large white hat. She was attend
ed by her sister, Miss Nellie O'SuIUvan,
as maid of honor, smartly gowned in
white, and wearing a white hat.
Many of the old families â old as fam
ilies go in Californiaâ made merry yes
terday afternoon, even a3 in the old
days, for wedding bells were chiming
for their happy kinsfolk.
Yesterday, at noon. Miss Ellen O'Sul
llvan, younsrest daughter of the late
banker, C. D. O'SuIlivan, became the
bride of Oscar Sutro. .*

Beware: Beware! Time's cycle brings

HAVE NARROW ESCAPE.â A carriage con
taining Councilman Pendlcton of Oakland and
sis sister was struck by a car at the corner
of Post and Leavenworth streets yesterday
atternoon. The vehicle was demolished, but
its occupants escaped with a few brulws.
The subject of Professor Gummere's
talk dealt chiefly with the old English
and Scotch ballads and their similar
ity lo those of modern times. In. a
particular instance this noticed of
the work of Kipling; whose style was
perfected by continuous reading of
the old ballads.
Besides holding a chair at Haver
ford Professor Gummere is the author
of a book entitled "Beginning of Po
etry."
The third 7 lecture of the summer
school series under the auspices of the
University of California was held at
Mechanics' Pavilion last night. Dr.
Francis Burton Gummere, professor
of English at Haverford College, lec
tured on "The Popular. Ballads of Tra
dition." The lecture was well attend
ed, but some objection was made by
the audience to its shortness. Many
thought the lectures were entirely too
short for the interesting subjects cov
ered and wished that cither the lec
tures be lengthened or more lectures
instituted.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Rosenfeld alleges that there have
been no dividends or profits, but that
the business has been run at a lot's.
Max Rosenfeld's suit for an injunc
tion against the Pioneer Automobile
Company, which was filed on Tuesday
and ' taken out by Attorney Eugene
Watson, was returned yesterday to
the County Clerk's office with an' order
from Judge Hunt restraining 1 the de
fendant company from selling its
property except at its actual value.
The directors of the concern, who are
individual' defendants, are E. P. Brin
egar, Ji S. Andrew. R. H. Davis, J. J.
Avis and W. A. fetringer.
It is set forth that, the Pioneer
company was incorporated with a
capital stock of 2000 shares, valued at
$100 each, of which 1150 shares wore
actually issued. E. P. Brine&ar he
came the holder of 110 shares with
out consideration, but gave his note
in payment therefor for $11,000, con
ditioned that it should be paid out of
the dividends and profits of the corpo
ration.

M. H. de Young is about to turn the
Chronicle building into a thirteen
story structure and to increase Its
dimensions largely by erecting a thir
teen-story addition on Kearny street,
on the lot recently purchased by him
from the Josephs of England. The
Josephs lot has a frontage of sixty-six
feet on Kearny and it runs to the
present walls of the Chronicle struc
ture. This will be entirely covered.
The addition will coincide, exteriorly,
in every respect to the Chronicle build
ing to which it will be joined. Three
stories will be added on the Market,
Geary and Kearny street frontages to
the old building, the present height be
ing but ten stories. The cost of the
lot on Kearny street and that of the
larpe addition on that street, together
with the new three stories on Market,
Kearny and Geary streets will involve
an expenditure of something like $1,
000.000. *
While the exterior will not be radi
cally changed, it being necessary to
make the new structure conform to the
older for the sake of appearances, the
Interior of the present Chronicle build-
Ing will be largely remodeled. In it
and its extensive annex there will prob
ably be four passenger elevators.
The old Bteel frame that was put up
when tall buildings were a rarity in
San Francisco is much heavier
than those now employed in
ordinary construction work. Conse
quently it is supposed to be sufficient
to carry the weight of three added
stories. The architects' plans have not
yet been submitted. ' De Young is
abroad, but will return to this city in
a few days. It is possible that he will
suggest some changes in the plans, but
the thirteen stories on Market, Geary
and Kearny streets are, assured.
M. II. dc Young Plans Higher and
Larger Structure on Market, Geary
and Kearny Streets.

If Captain Max de Bathe of London,
who, with his brother, &ugo, hus
band of LUy Langtry, has been visiting
San Francisco for several weeks, was
married to and later divorced from
Countess Stavra of Thessaly, he has no
personal knowledge of the fAct. A
telegram from New York yesterday
quoted the Countess, who recently ar
rived, there, with the statement that
she was married to Captain Max de
Bathe, but had separated from him.
The Countess was formerly the wife
of Charles Tilton. a capitalist of New
York, from whom she inherited her
wealth. Later she married Count
Stavra, whose widow she became
about two years ago. Her next matri
monial adventure, she claims, with
wJth Captain de Bathe, but it proved
an'unhappy alliance and was soon dis
solved.
When seen at the Palace Hotel yes
terday Captain Max de Bathe, who
made no attempt to conceal his dis
taste for the notoriety which he has
suddenly gained, said:
"I am acquainted with the Countess
and that is all. I was never married
to her and consequently we could
never have been divorced. I am at
a loss for an explanation for the
strange statements she is making in
Xew York_, where I imagine she has
been striving hard to get into public
print. The story from tho East is
absolutely' false."

Some forty property-owners appear
ed yesterday before the Board of
Works relative to the proposed sewer
ing, grading and macadamizing of
Park Hill avenue, Tilden and South
Broderick streets. Th'e majority fa
vored the work, but others protested
that the cost would be in excess'of 50
per cent. of the value of the district
liable to assessment Â« for the work.
After hearing the arguments on both
sides the board instructed the disput
ants to meet in private and come to
some agreement. It was suggested
that the improvement be done by pri
vate instead of public contract. Health
Officer, Raga.n called attention to . the
lack of pi-oper drainage facilities in
the locality described.
The board adopted specifications for
grading Nineteenth avenue, between
Trocadero road and Ocean avenue.
Several permits were granted for
erecting grand stands on Van,. Ness
avenue for the Knights Templar Con
clave.
The claim of the Automobile Tran
sit Company for $150 damages to an
automobile which ran into an obstruc
tion on Golden Gate avenue will . be
taken up with the street contractor.
For the second time no bids were
rc-coived for the poles for the Market
street illumination and new bids were
ortred to be invited.
The board ordered a communication
sent to the Chief of Police requesting
him to direct his patrolmen to stop
Ic-amsters from driving over pavements
which have been newly repaired and
also from knocking down the barri
cades surrounding the repaired por
tions. The Chief was also requested
to prevent damage to bituminous pave
ments from the lighting of bonfires
during political campaigns.
The board sent a letter to the United
Railroads complaining of inferior work
in repaving its tracks and requesting
that better work be done in future.
Board of Works Directs Disputants
v to Meet in Private and Settle
Their Differences.

the Continent reporting the fall of needed rains
ln Germany and Austria, thus relieving the
anxiety over the crop situation ln these two
countries. Cable advices also were received
from London reporting improving prospects for
the English crop. No new developments were
reported from the coast or up the State. Lo
cally there was an unchanged and firm mar
ket. Dealers' stocks Were small and as the
Indications were that these Â¦ supplies were

River Potatoes ruled firm during the early
trade under light supplies and a steady de
mand, and fresh arrivals of whites cleaned up
readily at a higher range of prices. The prin
cipal river boat arrived rather late and
brought a heavy cargo, but the prices estab
lished at the opening were well maintained
and the wharf was well cleaned up at the
close. â¢ Small lots of Salinas Burbanks were
still bringing $1 75 per cental,- but the top
quotation was considered an extreme figure
for the general market. Yellow Onions con
tinued to decline and ruled very weak, with
supplies accumulating.
There waa continued weakness In miscel
laneous vegetables and large quantities had to
be held over. Lima Beans had a sharp de
cline and other Beans were practically unsal
able. The top quotations for Green Corn in
sacks ' was . obtained " only for the best stock
from across the bay.- Offerlngi from Stockton
were hard to sell at 30<@73c per sack and some
very poor lota were offering at 25c. but found
few buyers. Tomatoes continued . to arrive
freelv apd there waa an abundance of caxried
over stock on hand.

NEW TORK, Aor. 3. â Speculative activity
in nocks continued llÂ«ht to-day, but such
ir.tÂ»reit as there was shifted in a pronounced
way to stocks of railroads whoÂ«e traffic is
largely maie^ \if of cctton. This was not sur
prlsir.g ln visw of the character of the report
of the Agricultural Department on the con
dition cf the cotton crop on July 25. which
rcaie its erpÂ«arance at noon to-day and which
presented a eltuation without precedent in
the history of the cotton trade. The average
condition of 91.6 per cent has never been ex
ceeded except Â»t the corresponding period ln
l. fi i4. when 61. 3 per cent was reported. Added
to thi, the fact that the 32.000.000 acrta
plar.ted this year in much the largest on
recr.rd and the seneatlonal view of the report
taken by the speculative markets will be un
dcrvtood. Attention was somewhat diverted
fn-m the spring wheat ultuatSon and tha
wheat market also revealed some inclination to
regard yesterday's alarm on that score as
overdone. The tone of the general speculation
ln stocks, however. vr\r markedly conservative
In eplte of the sympathetic effect of the ad
vance in the cotton carriers. Southern Pa
cific's riye was the only instance cf notable
strength <n the general list acd was unex
pialned by news. Jt was regarded as designed
to further the subscription demand fcr the
cÂ«w stork.. An increase In refined sugar and
a decline ia copper were equally without ef
fect on 5-ugar and en Amalgamated Copper.
Labor dlfftmltiea were a continuing repressive
effect. Sterling exchange advanced again to
where ro'.d fxr.orts were unchanged from tact
week snd a goll outpo became an Immediate
probability asair.et it. The market closed
rather heavy at rosie recMsion*.

There is no further news regarding thÂ»
Raisin situation and everything else Is as pre

Late mail advices from New Tork say: "For
the season thrre Is reported ta be a very good
jobbing demand for spot Prunes, with stocks
llpht and badly broken. Sizes 60s to 90s in
clusive are particularly scarce, and It la held
that unless seme stock of these sizes Is shortly
shipred from tlie roast the spot market will b<s
made bare by tfce steady requirements of con
sumption. The demand, however, does not
se*m to include SOs. There is a steady demand
for carload lots of new crop for October ship
ment on a 2c f. o. b. bag basis for Santa
Clara and ls%c for northern fruit, but no dis
position Is shown to buy on a larger scale.
We hear of no business of consequence In
either Peaehe> or Apricots of the new crop
for forward shipment from the roast, buyer*
apparently holding off for concessions from the
present high prices. Spot stocks of both va
rieties an? about exhausted."

Trade in deciduous fruits was quite active,
as In addition to the regular demand for local
and near-by wants there was a good inquiry
for top quality stock for shipment to Puget
Sound ports. Small packages of Peachee.
Plums and Apricots did better as a result of
the increased demand, and occasional sales of
desirable varieties of Plums were reported at
a sliKht*advance over the quotations. Peaches
In lug boxes were in good request locally, with
the general run of offerings selling from 73c
to ?1 per box, while strictly fancy stock from
NUes readily commanded the outside quota
tions. The leading canners were offering $25
per ten for good stock, and one outside con
cern paid $-35 for one lot. , There were no fresh
arrivals of Apricots in bulk, and what stock
waÂ« carried over from Tuesday was cleaned up
at nominal prices. Advices from the growing
districts say that the crop of Royals Is about
exhausted. Wrapped Bartlett Pears weTÂ« In

for shipping at a small premium. Bulk stock
was well cleaned up by canners at tha pre
viously quoted rates. Apple3 continued weak,
with the top quotation an extreme figure for
the fanciest stock. Nutmeg Melons were low

were steady at unchanged rates. Grapes w-rÂ«
plentiful and small packages dragged badly
at a lower range of prices. Berries were gen

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â The English market was firm,
with higher futures, but the French market
was eaay. Â¦
Chicago was excited, with the Northwest
and Southwest large buyers. There were still
many reports of crop damage in the North
west, but Snow Issued a report disclaiming any
serious injury. It confines the rust damage to
South Dakota and says it is very variable,
being heavy in a very few counties and light j
In a large number, with none worth reporting I
in the majority. St. Louis reported the cash
demand very strong at a 2c advance. The
condition of the Ohio crop was announced as
â¬0. against 59 last month and SO a year ago.
The Chicago wires of R. Brent Mitchell said:
"It was rather a hesitating market with tr- !
regular prices; it showed a further advance 1
â¢ early, but met with a great deal of profit- |
taking and pit traders were disposed to play
for a reaction. There was some buying at the 1
decline and the close waa steady and firm.
The Northwest again claimed crop damage, i
but Snow's report, which was the bearish j
feature of the day, disclaimed any material
injury. There was reported a nood cash de- I
mami in this market and In St. Louis, but ,
Kansas City reports the demand rather slow, j
Foreigners were fair buyers. Naturally we .
feel a little conservative about advising pur
chases on top of a 15c advance. We are In
clined to the view that the damage reports from
the Northwest are somewhat exaggerated.
There may be two sides to the market for the
time being, but we should feel disposed to ad
vise purchases of Wheat on what Â¦ might be
conclderd a fair reaction."
In this market trade was by no means as
active as on Tuesday and futures were weak
er. There is good buying on the breaks around 1
$1 45, but any advance calls out large selling '
orders. The cash Wheat shows no further j
change. ;

Hay arid Feed stuffs.
Handler* of FeedstnfTs continue to qucte
' firm markets for these lines at unchanged
Â¦ prices. There Is no change in thÂ« Hay situa
tion, which Is thus stated in the weekly cir
', cular of Somers & Co. :
"There has been some little diminution in
Hay shipments during the past week, Urt total
amounting to 420O tons in comparison with
5600 tons for the week preceding. The rail
road company, because of the accumulation on
the tracks here, has refused to take Hay from
j many points, but in spite of this fact there is
I still quite a congestion In the local freight
I yards. Conditions remain unchanged in every
I way here, for the demand continues lieht for
j this season of the year, and everybody" in tha
city seems to be looking for lower prices. In
the country some tale* have been made, al
though most of the farmers seem Inclined to
hold out. anticipating some improvement in
; values. Tber* is quite a bit of Hay golns;
' south from several interior points, although
It Is anticipated that this will slacken off in
â¢ the near future owing to the fact that they
are rapidly filling their warehouses there. We
are still hearing of a surplus of Hay in many
districts which we do not usually visit, and at
these points there is now a general feeling
that they must toon begin to ship In their sur
plus product to the San Francisco market. To
summarize, we would state that everything
points to rather an overcrowded market for
the remainder of August."
BRANâ $21022 per ton.
MIDDLINGSâ $24029 per ton.
Batter was steady at the advance yesterday
and tha market was reported in satisfactory
shape for sellers. A good deal ; cf stock has
lately been sold to the public by several largo
retailers in cut-rata sales, and thers has also
been a very fair demand from interior towns.
so stocks, while still liberal, are no longer
unwieldy. Receipts continue large, but tha
demand is absorbing them very well.
â¢ Cheese is weak and shows signs of again
accumulating. Some new points ar% shipping
into this market and the dealers' shelves are
gradually loading up again.
Eggs are quoted weak and dull under free
receipts and liberal st>cis, though quotations
are maintained. At present relative prices of

special thanks, and to express my appreciation
for the loyalty and effort that has been shown

For the hunter the nearby mountains
afford Inviting opportunity for deer in
season and the lover of rod and reel may

by the patient expert.
The success of Camp Vacation, located
on the Russian River, four miles beyond
Guerneville, has demonstrated satisfac
torily the possibility of conducting an
extensive camp on strictly first-class ho
tel principles and at an extremely mod
erate cost to its patrons. This camp was
brought Into existence In the summer of
1903 under the ownership and direct su
pervision of Mrs. L. C. Cnopius, and ac
commodated last season a maximum
number of about one hundred guests
dally. Public approval was so pro
nounced that Mrs. Cnopius decided upon
a larger camp for this year, and accord'
lngly the season was opened with ade
quate sleeping accommodations for two
hundred and fifty and an^enlarged din
ing-room capable of seating that number
at a single sitting. From the first of
June the daily attendance rarely fell un
der 160 guests, and July '2d, 3d and 4th
more than BOO people were comfortably
cared for. The grounds, comprising 160
acres on the bank of the Russian River,
opposite the celebrated Bohemian Grove,
are threaded by delightful shaded paths
and the tents are so widely scattered
that guests may enjoy all the seclusion
of a private camp with none of the dis
comforts and annoyances. Indeed, with
the 500 guests over the Fourth of July;
one would find it difficult to believe," ex
cept at meal time, that there were two
score people on the grounds. This is ac
counted for by the fact that there are
four miles of boating on the river, a
number of delightful swimming pools
and secluded spots innumerable. A danc
ing pavilion, capable of accommodating
400 without overcrowding, a commodious
ofHce building, In connection with which
is the postoflice and boat-booking office,
a. fleet of sixty safe and speedy boats
with the best of oars . and . appliances,
croquet grounds and tennis courts , are
among the conveniences over which ex
pense has not been spared. .
The resort remains open from April to
October and the trains of the California
Northwestern Railway run . directly to
the grounds, conveying passengers from
San Francisco for 72 miles through one
of the most charming scenic sections of
the State.
Next season Mrs. Cnopius will double
her dining-room" capacity, install a cozy
hall for guests on - chilly evenings,
warmed by a huge -old-fashioned | fire
place. She expects a daily patronage of
about. 500 and " an attendance of three
times that number over the Fourth of
July. The table is guaranteed to be un
surpassed by any similar resort,. both as
to quality, and quantity of food and the
perfection of table service.

Local railroad men are looking for

called for this afternoon, when it ia j
reported that President John Martin t
and the other directors of the company j
will resign. It was learned from a re
liable source yesterday that arrange
ments have been completed for the
formal turning over of the road to the j
Harriman syndicate, which acquired j
control of the property several months
ago.
When seen yesterday afternoon. Pres
ident John Martin, through whom the
deal with the Harriman syndicate was
negotiated, admitted that a special
meeting had been called, but he re
fused to discuss what action would be
taken by the directorate.
"All I can say at this time," said he,
"Is that I am still president of the
company, but I am not at liberty to
say what will take place at to-morrow's
meeting. The proceedings will be made
known Immediately after the meeting
adjourns."
According to information gleaned
from other sources the stock which has
been held by John Martin, Eugene de
Sabla and their associates will be In
the hands of Harriman agents to-mor
row and the latter will attend the
meeting for the purpfose of filling the |
vacancies caused by the resignation of j
the present officers. Following closely
on this news is another story that Har
riman will soon take a hand In the
management of the California North
western Railroad, which he is supposed
to have a controlling Interest in. and
possibly consolidate the two roads un
der one management.

An Interesting paper was read by
Professor Shaw, In which he made
many valuable suggestions. Among
these was that wheat should be bred
as animals are, using only the very
best of each year's crop for seed. This
method was employed successfully in
developing the sugar beet. He also
advised that if an appropriation is se
cured a specialist be brought from one
of the Eastern States, such -as Minne
sota. This, he said, would be much
cheaper than experimenting with In
experienced men. Another meeting of
the committee will be called at an early
date.
At a meeting of the subcommittee on'
wheat of the State Board of Trade yes- !
terday afternoon it was unanimously!
decided that every effort be made^to â¢
induce the Legislature at the coming
session to appropriate $6000 for expe- !
rlmental purposes. The decline in the
quality of California wheat has be- i
come alarminug, and members of the j
committee and visiting growers agreed
that it is necessary that steps be taken
at once to flrid the cause of the trou
ble and suggest a remedy. Horace
Davis pledged $500 from the millers for
the preliminary work, and an appeal
will probably be made to the farmers
to add to this amount.
Those present at the meeting were'
General ChlDman. chairman; F. W.
McMillen, wheatgrower of Fair Oaks. I
Sacramento County; W. P. Steinbeck
of Stockton; Horace Davis, T. C. Fried
lander. Arthur Briggs, G. W. Shaw of

culture, and Professor. E. J. Wixson of

showed samples of wheat grown side
by side from the same seed on irrigated i
and dry soil. The wheat grown on the j
dry land was smaller, but richer in '

Mrs. Hanford's complaint, filed last
month, was Interesting. The rift In
their domestic happiness appeared on
Â¦ May 15, when Hanford introduced his

Â¦with." On May 15, at their home at
â¢ 2207 Clay street. Hanford told his wife
Â¦ that he had "lost his nerve," but it
â¢was not until two days later that he j
confessed that there was another
woman In the case. He was then 111
. In bed and asked his wife to send for
Mrs. Cavalsky. Mrs. Cavalsky was j
summoned by telephone and came to
the house at S o'clock in the evening.
Â¦ She remained until 10:15. and Mrs.
Hanford saw her leaning over her hus
' band's bed, embracing him. When she
reproached Hanford for his conduct he

Apparently there was some difficulty
in meeting the final payment, for on
June 2S, 1901, Bates and Miller agreed
to deed a one-third interest in the
ranch to Davis for $20,000, which
Davis was to pay to the Union Trust
Company on July 1. Bates tendered
a deed for his share, but Davis is said
to have "bucked" on the payment of
the $20,000 until Miller's deed was
given. Bates said that he would guar
antee that Miller would make the
deed, and he alleges that Davis then
said: "Then give me your note for
510,000 and I will destroy it when Mil
ler executes his deed to me."
Both Miller and Bates executed the
deed on July 5, but Bates declares that
he did not know that Davis had not
destroyed the note until two weeks be
fore Davis died. At that time Davis is
said to have been too weak mentally to
remember previous business transac
tions.
Bates states the circumstances un
der which his note for $10,000 was
given, as follows: On September 26,1300,
Bates and E. O. Miller contracted to
purchase for $60,000 a tract of land in
Kings County, consisting of 18,740
acres. On that date they paid $5000 to
the Union Trust Company and agreed
to pay $15,000 more when the deeds
were delivered and $40,000 on July 1,
1901.
An echo of the methods of Samuel
Davis, the late speculator In gilt
edged securities who left a fortune of
$2,000,000 or more, Is heard In the suit
begun yesterday by George E. Bates
against Julius C. Reis, executor of the
Davis estate, to have a note for $10,000
returned to him or canceled. The liti
gation reverts to the purchase of a
ranch In Kings County,' which has
since proved a big investment â on so
valuable, in fact, that the adminis
trator was not satisfied with the ap
praisement made of it by Kings Coun
ty appraisers, and he secured an or
der of court to have the land reap
praised by the gentlemen who found
Davis' local estate to be worth more
than $1,500,000. -""

such force that the driver was unable
to check the animal, so he applied the

wounded on the head and neck that
for a time her life trembled in the bal
ance. Ten times was the case called
before Judge Mogan, and each time a

W. F. Allen, dairyman at Forty
eighth avenue and P street, warbled
a blithesome greeting to the dawn as
he -copiously diluted with water the
lacteal product of his seven cows.
Watching from concealment. were two
sleuths of the Health Department, Dr.
M. J. Brady and Dr. Hassler, and. when
they believed they had seen enough to
warrant Allen's arrest they emerged
from their hiding-place and took him
and the debilitated milk to the police
station.
When the case was called before
Judge Cabaniss yesterday there was
no appearance of the defendant, his
ball was declared forfeited and a bench
warrant Issued for his capture. The
two complaining witnesses were there,
however, ready to recount how they
confirmed their suspicion that Allen
was putting more aqua in his milk
than was good for the folk who con
sumed it, especially as the water was
not of first-class quality. For two
days they lay low in a house adjoin
ing that of the suspect, but not until
they concealed themselves in his barn
was their patience rewarded. They
saw him systematically measure out
the water ere he spilled it into the
milk at the ratio of one pint to the
gallon. The water was taken from a
well, and analysis of it disclosed a
large percentage of Impurity.
When the detectives taxed Allen with
overdoing his dilution act he ingenu

pint of water in each of milk
would make the mixture undrinkable,
because of the richness of the fluid as
it came from the cows, said richness
being caused by the ultra-nutritious

quantity. He realized that he would
save both time and money by feeding
his kine less liberally, but he was such

C. Curtin Sale at lia!e's
O/j/y One of the Causes Underlying the Tremendous Business of
Sharp price reductions on all summer goods in our own resr-
ular stock is another.
And the third : The faith women have in Hale's, in Hale
statements and Hale values.
It Is this trust women put In the Hale store we value above everything.
That's why we understate rather than overstate: why every bit of our adver-
tising: Is censored bjÂ»fore being printed. We don't want to lead you to expect
more than you will get or to give you a false Impression In any way.
Certainly there is a magnificent grouping of opportunities to-day.
All C. Curtin Remnants
Dress Goods at Half Price
One-half off C. Curtin's reduced prices. Not off his regular
prices, for Mr. Curtin had marked these remnants way down in
his removal sale before we bought his entire stock. See how
much more it means to pay just half these reduced prices.

dress goods. We have left C. Curtin's reduced price mark3 on
them and
We Will Cut Marked Prices in Two

table near the elevator. We take as much buj-ing space as we can to
