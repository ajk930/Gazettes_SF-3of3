(Copyright, 1529. by Charles Scribner's
Sons.) :
WHEN the King of the Cannibal
Islands made faces at Queen
Victoria and a European mon
arch set the cables tingling
with his compliments on the cx
- ploit the indignation in England was not
Ices than the surprise, for the thing was
nut so common as it has since become.
But when it transpired that a gift of pe
culiar significance was to follow the con
gratulations, to give them weight, the
inference prevailed that the white poten
tate and the black had taken simulta
neous leave of their fourteen senses. For
the k'ift was a pearl of price unparalleled,
picked aforetime by British cutlasses
fiona a Polynesian setting and presented
by British royalty to the sovereign who
seized this opportunity of restoring it to
its original possessor.
The incident would have been a god
send to the press a few weeks later. Even
in Juae" there were leaders, letters, large
headlines, leaded type, the Dally Chronicle
dcvuling half its literary page to a
charming drawing of the island capita!
which the new Pall Mall, in a leading
articc headed by a pun, advised the Gov
errmeat to blow to flinders. I was my
self driving a poor but not dishonest quill
at the lime, and the topic of the hour
goaded me into' satiric verse which ob
tained a better place than anything I
bad yet turned out. I had let my flat in
tow:i and Uiken Inexpensive quarters at
Thames Ditton on the plea of a dlsln
ttrteted passion for the river.
"First-r&te, old boy!" said Raffles (who
mutt neecfc come and see me there), lying
back In the boat, while I sculled and
steered. *'i suppose they pay you pretty
well for tlicsc, Â«b?"
"Net a penny .7
*No::3cnsc. Bunny! I thought they paid
so well?. Give them time and you'll get
youi check."
'â¢Oh, no, I shan't."- said I gloomily.
"I've got to be content with the honor of
getting in; the editor wrote to say so In
so many .v/t^ds," 1 added. But I gave the
grnt Itmanl.is distintniishpd name. '
â¢'You don't mean to say you've written
for payment already?"
,NÂ«Â». Jt was the last thing 1 had intended
to atJxnit. but I had done It. The mur
der v.-as out; th^re was no sense in fur
ther concealment. I had written for my
money btcauce I really needea it; If he
muM I was cursedly hard up.
KÂ«imes nodded an though he knew al
ready. I trained to my woes. It was
no easy matter to keep your end up as a
raw free ltnce of letters; for my part
1 was afraid 1 rvnste neither uell.enough
nor ill enough for success. ! 1 suffered
from a persistent ineffectual feeling after
style. Verse I could manage, but It did
not pay. To rertonal paragraphs and the
baser journalism 1 could not and I would
not fcioop.
Kiifflea nodded again, this time with a
smile that stayed in his eyes as he leaned
back watching me. I knew that he was
thinking of other things I had stooped to,
and I thought 1 knew what he was going
to say. lie had said It before so often;
he was cure to say It again. I had my
answer ready, but evidently he was tired
of asking the same question. His lids
fell, he took up the paper he had dropped
and 1 sculled the length of the old red
wall of Hampton Court before he spoke
again.
"And they gave you nothing for these!
My dear Bunny, they're capital, not only
at verses, but for srystallizlng your sub
ject and putting it in a nutshell. Cer
tainly you've taught me more about it
than I knew before. But is It really worth
Â£50,000â a tingle pearl V
"A hundred, I belie\-e; but that wouldn't
scan."
"A hundred thousand pounds!" said.
Rafiies with his eyes chut And again
I made certain what was coming, but
again I was mistaken. "If it's worth all
that." he cried at last, "there would be
no getting rid of it at all; it's not like a
diamond that you can subdivide. But I
b*g your pardon. Bunny, I was forget
ting!"
Acd we e&id no more about the Em
peror's gift, for pride thrives on an empty
pocket, and no privation would have
drawn from me the proposal which I had
expected K&Bes to make. My expecta
tion had been half a hope, though I only
knew it now. But neither did we touch
again on what Raffles professed to/ have
forgottenâ my "apostasy," my "lapse into
virtue," as he had been pleased to call it
We were both a little client, a little con-
E.W. HORNUNG
strained, each preoccupied with his own
thoughts. It was months since we had
met, and as I saw him oft* toward 11
o'clock that Sunday night I fancied it
was for more months that we were say
ing tcood-by.
But as we waited for the train I saw
those clear eyes peering at me under the
station lamps, .and when I met their
glance Raffles shook his head.
"You don't look well on it. Bunny."
eaid he. "I never did believe in this
Thames Valley. You want a change of
air."
I wished I might get It.
"What you realy want is a sea voyage."
"And a winter at St. Mori tz. or do you ;
recommend Cannes or Cairo? It's all
very veil, A. J.. but you forget what I
told you about my funds." \u25a0
"I forget nothing. I merely don't want
to hurt your feelings. But, look here, a
sea voyage you shall have. I want a
change myself, and you shall come with
me as my guest. We'll spend July in the
Mediterranean."
"But you're playing cricket "
"Hang the cricket!"
"Well. I thought you meant it "
"Of course I meant it. Will you come?"
"Like a shotâ if you go."
. And I shook his hand and waved mine
in farewell, . with the perfectly good-hu
mored conviction that I should hear no
more of the matter. It was a passing
thought, no .more, no less. I soon wished
it vicre more; that wtek found me wishing
myself out of England for good and all.
I was making nothing. I could but sub
sist on the difference between the "rent I
paid for my flat and the rent at which
I had sublet it, furnished, for the sen
eon.- And the season was near its end
and creditors awaited me in town. Waa
it possible to be entirely honest?.l had run
no bills when I had m6ney in ray pocket,
and the more downright dishonesty
seemed to me the less ignoble;
But from Raffles of course I heard
nothing more; a week went by, and half
another week; then, late on the second
Wednesday night, I found a telegram
from him at my lodgings, after seeking
him vainly in town and dining. with des
peration at the solitary club to which I
still belonged.
"Arrange to leave Waterloo by North
German Lloyd special," he wired, "9:25
a. m. Monday next; will meet you South
ampton aboard Uhlan with tickets; am
writing."
And write he did, a light-hearted letter
enough, but full of serious solicitude for
me and for my health and prospectsâ a
letter almost touching in the light of our
past relations, in the twilight of their
complete rupture. He said that .he had .
booked two berths to Naples; that we
wÂ«re bound for Capri, which was clearly
the. island of the Lotos-eaters; that we
would baak there together "and. for a
while forget." It was a charming letter, i
I had never seen Italy; the privilege of
initiation should be his. No mistake waa
greater than to deem it an .impossible
country for ihe Bummer, i "The Bay of
Naples was never so divine," and he wrote
of "faery lands forlorn." as though .the
poetry sprang unbidden to hlB pen. I T\>
come back to earth and proaÂ£, . I ; might
think it unpatriotic of him' t<) choose a
German boat, but on no other line did.
you receive such attention and accommo
dation for your mone"y. There was a" hint
of better reasons. Raffles wrote, as he
had telegraphed, from Bremen; and I
gathered that t the personal use of some
little influence with the authoriies there
had resulted in a material reduction of
our fares.
Imagine my excitement and delight! I
managed to pay what I owed at Thames
Ditton, to squeeze a email editor for a
very small, check and my tailors for one
more flannel suit. I remember that I
broke my last sovereign to get a^x of
Sullivan's cigarettes tor Rattles to smoke
on the voyage. But my heart was as
light as my purse on the Monday mom
ing, the fairest morning of- an unfair
summer, when the special whirled me
through the sunshine to the sea-, .-. ;.
A tender awaited us at Southampton.-
Raffles was not on board, nor did' l really
look for him till/ we reached the liner's
side. And then I.< looked : in vain. :_ His
face was not among \u25a0'.'\u25a0 the \u25a0'- many /:- that
fringed the rail;' bis hand wai not o* the
few that waved to , friends. :; I climbed
aboard In a sudden heaviness. . I bad no
ticket nor the money . to ; pay^ for one. : I
did not even -.know .the number of:my
room. My heart was in my mouth as I
waylaid a steward 'and \u25a0 asked if a ,- Mr.
Katfles was on board.*; Thank heaven-^he
was! But where? The man did not know,
was plainly on some other errand,* and a
hunting I must go. But there: w,as; no
sign of him on the promenade 'deck and
none below in the saloon:"the,smoking
room was empty but for^ a little German
with a red mustache twisted .into -.'â¢ his
eyes; nor was Raffles In his own cabin,
whither I Inquired my^way in despera
tion, but where the sight of his own name
on the baggage was, certainly a , further
reassurance. Why he himself kept In the
background, however, I could not "con
ceive, and only sinister reasons - would
suggest themselves in explanation.
"So there you are! I've been looking
for you all over the ship!"
Despite the graven prohibition I had
tried the bridge as a last resort and there
indeed was A. J. Raffles seated oh a sky
light and leaning over one of the officers'
long chairs, in which reclined* a girl- in a
white drill coat and skirtâ a slip of a girl
with a pale skin, dark hair and rather
remarkable eyes. So much I nbte'^'as he v
rose and quickly turned: thereupon I."
could think of nothing but Uhe swift '
â¢ grimace which preceded- a start of well
felsrned astonishment. â¢. . *
"Why, Bunny T\ cried Raffles., ."Where 1 '

It was not as though Yon Heumann never

We can do nothing, before wÂ» cÂ«t to
Genoa, and that won't be till Sunday
night. .The voyage Is still young, and so
are we. Let's make the most of things
while we can."
It was after dinner on the promenade '
deck, and as Raffles spoke he glancec
sharply fore and aft, leaving .me next
moment with a step full of purpose. X
retired to the smoking-room to smoks \u25a0
.and read In a corner,, and to watch Yon
Heumann, who very soon cams to drink
beer and to sulk In another.
\u25a0 Few travelers tempt the Red Sea at
.midsummer; the Uhlan was very empty
Indeed. She had. however, but a limited
supply of cabins on the promenade deck,
and there was just that excuse for my
sharing Rades' room. I could \u25a0 have
had one to myself downstairs, but I must
be up above. Raffles had Insisted that I
should insist on the point. So we were
.together, I think, without suspicion,
though also without any object that I
could see.
On the Sunday afternoon I was asleep
In my berth, the lower one. when the
curtains were shaken by Raffles, who
' was in hts shirtsleeves on the settee
"Achilles -sulking In his bunk!"
"What else is there to do?" I asked
him, as I stretched and yawned. I noted,
however, the good humor of his tone, and
did my best to catch it.
"I have 'found something else. Bunny."
"I dare say!"
Â» "You misunderstand me. The whipper
snapper's making his f*ntury this after
noon. I've had other fish to fry."
I . swung* my legs over the side of my
berth and sat forward, as be was sitting,
all attention. The inner door, a grating. .
was shut and bolted and curtained like
the open porthole. \u25a0
"We shall be at Genoa before sun-
Bet," continued Raffles. . "It's the place
where 'the" deed's got to be done."
"So. you still mean to do It?"
"Did. I ever say I didn't?"
"You have said so little either way."
"Advisedly so. my dear Bunny: why
spoil a pleasure trip by talking un
necessary shop? But now the time has
come. It must be done at Genoa or not
at all."/
-On'land?" -
"No, on board, to-morrow night. To
night would do. but to-morrow is better
In case of mishap. If we were forced
to use violence we could let away by
the earliest train and nothing; be
knqwn till the. ship was sailing and Yon
Heumann found dead or druggedâ "
"Xotdead!" I exclaimed.
"Of course not," assented Raffles, "or
there would be no need for us to bolt:
but if we should have to bolt. Tuesday
morning : is our time, when this ship
has got to sail whatever happens. But
I don't anticipate any violence.. Vio

inches lons an* half that length. It
opened outward into the ventilating:

"That," said he. "la our door to for

see much, because It, doesn't open far:
but loosening a couple of screws will
set that^all right. l The shaft, as you
may seei Is more or less bottomless: ,
you pass under it whenever you gro to
your bath, and the top la a skylight
on the bridge. That's why thl3 thing '
has to . be done while we're ; at, Genoa,
because they keep no watch on the

"Resist! He won't get the chance.

perhaps .unfair to remind you. Yon

"And I?" Â»

Bunny, but I found it devilish difficult

tain to sleep with a bolted door, which
he, of course, would have unbolted, and
spoke of other ways of laying a false

Raffles anticipated a tiresome search.
The pearl would be about Von'Heu

exactly where and In what he kept it.
Naturally I asked how be could have
come by such knowledge, and his an
swer led up to a momentary unpleas

"It's a very old. story, Bunny. I really

. * F, when California was admitted to
I the Union, no Spanish grants had
J[ existed and the homestead policy of
the Government had been In force,
and had been honestly and faithfully
administered, the Industrial history of
this State would have been entirely dif
ferent. It is even more than probable
-that the population would have been at
least 1,000,000 greater than at the pres
ent time.
"What is here meant by the faithful
enforcement of the homestead policy
Includes the original conception of Its
promoters that the homesteader should
occupy. Improve and cultivate the land
to which his -homestead claim related,
for at least five years before receiving
a negotiable title.
The first homestead bill was intro
duced Into the House of Representa
tives by George W. Julian of Indiana
and contained the provisions above
noted. This policy was based upon the
theory that 160 acres of land is the
proper Quantity required by the Indus
try of a elngle cultivator and his fam
ily. If that policy had been In force
from the admission of the State into
the Union to the present time, every
160 acres of land capable of profitable
cultivation would have remained in the
ownership of the original homesteader,
or his successor In Interest, and would
have developed the conditions that at
tend diversified farming. The rich allu
vial land of California in the Interior
and coast counties would have been
subdivided into 160-acre farms, and the
full capabilities of the soil and the
climate would have been wisely com
plied with In this pursuit of the mani
fold objects of cultivation. This would
mean email orchards, small vineyards,
Einall grain fields, the home production
of dairy products, poultry, pork, beef
and mutton. The cultivator of the soil
would have produced on his farm the
full round of his necessities In the way
of fruits, garden vegetables, milk,
cheese, pork, beef and the other farm
products, following the valuable pre
cedent of the early settlement of the
Northwestern States. The prlmitiev
condition of the small holding in the
instance under consideration would
have been perpetuated, because .t would
have been 'intrenched against the as
eaults of land monopoly by the multi
plicity and value of improvements, and
the very high value of the land.
Under this system there would have
been an abundance of white labor for
axl- the Industrial necessities of the
country. There would have been no
place for Chinese labor. The urban

"Wily worm!" said L "Now I see

"Sure you're not still?"
"No; now I understand what has beaten

I never dreamt it was part of the game."
"So you think it was that and nothing
more?"
"You deep old dogâ of course I do!"
"You didn't know she was the daugh

"There are wealthy women by the

"It doesn't occur to you that I might
like to draw stumps, start clean and live
happily ever afterâ ln the bush?"
"With that voice? It certainly does

"Bunny!" he cried so fiercely that I
braced myself for a blow.
But no more followed.
"Do you think you would live happily?"
I mafle bold to ask him.
"God knows!" he answered. And with
that he left me to marvel at his look
and tone and more than ever at the In
sufficlently ' exciting cause.
Of all the mere feats of cracksmanship
which I have seen Raffles perform, at
once tbe most delicate and most dlfllcult
was that which he accomplished between
1 and 2 o'clock on the Tuesday morning
aboard the North German steamer Uhlan,
lying at anchor in Genoa harbor. .;:l1
Not a hitch occurred. Everything had
been foreseen; everything happened as I
had teen assured everything must. No
body was about below; only the ship's
boys on deck and nobody on the bridge.
It was 25 minutes past 1 when Raffles,
without a stitch of clothing on his body,
but with a glass phial, corked with cotton
wool, between his teeth, and a tiny screw
driver behind his ear, squirmed feet
first through the ' ventilator over his
\u25a0berth; and It was 19 minutes past 2 when
he returned, head first, with the phial
still between his teeth and tbe cotton wool
rammed home to still the rattling of that
uhlch lay like a great gray bean within.
He had taken the screws out and put them
in again; he had unfastened Yon Heu
mann's ventilator and had left It fast as
he had found itâ fast as he instantly pro
ceeded to make his own . As for Yon
Heumann, it hadT>een enough to place
the drenched wad first on his mustache,
and then to bold It between his gaping
lips; thereafter the intruder had climbed
both ways across his shins without elic
iting a groan.
And here was the prizeâ this pearl as
large as a filbertâ with a pale pink tinge
like a lady's finger-nailâ this spoil of a
filibustering ageâ this gift from a Euro
pean Emperor to a South Sea chief. \u25a0 We
gloated over It when all was snug... We
toasted It in whisky and soda water laid
in over night In view of the great mo
ment. Exit the moment was greater,
more triumphant than our most sanguine

population, under a distributive system
of land' holding, affords sufficient elas
ticity in the labor supply to satisfy the
irregular demands of '^rm labor as the
various seasons of harvest occur.
Rural trade centers in * the way of
prosperous villages would have" existed
everywhere, while all the larger Inte
rior cities would have been more pros
perous and more populous than now.
An official ascertainment of the con
ditions of the land holdings of the Sac
ramento Valley was made and pub
lished some twelve years ago, and it
was then disclosed that the .holdings
of one hundred land proprietors in the
Sacramento Valley aggregated 1.600,000
acresâ an average of 16,000 acres to
the landlord. Conditions have. not.ma
terially changed. This vicious land sys
tem was inherited from the Mexican
Government, the' former sovereign of
the soil, and the policy of that Govern
ment, which generated this condition,
related to the sem! -barbarous occupa
tion of cattle â¢ husbandry on ' large
ranches, which, at that time, consti
tuted the highest use of the soil. The
monopolised condition of the fertile
agricultural lands of California, from Its
earliest history to the present time, has
constituted the greatest barrier to the
industrial and commercial progress of
the State, and to Its moral and material
well-being.; To this monopolistic con
dition is referable the speculative spirit
which has attended the agricultural
and horticultural activities of the State.
The cost of reaching California de
nied to it in the earlier periods of Its
history a supply of common white
labor. This deficiency was sought to be
remedied by the Introduction of Chinese
labor. Farms, comprising 10,000. 20.000
and even 40,000 acres of land, devoted
to wheat raising," found, their industrial
necessities completely supplemented by
the cheap labor of the lower classes of
Chinese, because these people occupied
a very low plane of civilized want.
Land monopoly was responsible for
the Chinese Invasion, and if It had been
permitted to pursue its natural in
stincts, the industrial system of Cali
fornia, as it relates to rural occupa
tions, would have presented but two
classes â large landed proprietors and a
degraded .servile Chinese labor, leaving
no well-defined place for the non-capi
tallst white man.' This industrial
aspect would have been completely
analogous to the conditions produced
by slavery, in tho Southern States,
where the industrial system conferred
well-defined relations upon \ tho slave
owner and the slave, with the common
life relegated to the category of "poor
white trash," possessing only the alter
native of .emigration or the degradation*
of perpetual ignorance and poverty.
The agricultural and horticultural
products of California make better re-
dreams. All we had now to do was to
secrete the gem (which Raffles had pried
from Its setting, replacing the latter), so
that we could stand the strictest search
and yet take it ashore with us at Naples,
and this Raffles was domg when I turned
in. I myself would have landed incon
tinently that night at Genoa ami bolted
with the spoil; he would not bear of it,
for a dozen good reasons which will be
obvious.
On the whole I do not think that any
thing was discovered or suspected before
we weighed anchor, but I cannot be Bure.
It Is difficult to believe that a man could
be chloroformed in his sleep and feel iio
telltale effects, sniff no suspicious â¢ odor
in the morning. Nevertheless Yon Heu
mann reappeared as though nothing had
happened to him, his German cap over his
eyes and his mustaches brushing . the
peak. And by 10 o'clock we were 4 quit^)f
Genoa: the last lean, blue-chinned official
had left our decks; the last fruit-seller
had been beaten off with bucketfuls of
water and left cursing us from Us boat;
the last passenger had come aboard at the
last momentâ a fussy graybeardwho kept
the big ship waiting while he haggled
with his boatman over half a lira. But
at length we were off, the tug was shed,
the lighthouse passed, and Raffles and I
leanc-d together over the rail watching
our shadows on the pale green, liquid,
veined marble that again washed the ves
sel's 6lde. 'S'Zu

These truths have been -so apparent
to- the people of California that they
incorporate into ; their \u25a0 constitution a
declaration, found. in section 3, article
xvll:
- "The holding- of large tracts of land,
uncultivated and unimproved, by indi
viduals or corporations. Is against the
public interest, and should be discour
aged by all means not inconsistent with
the' rights, of private property."
Recently attention has been directed
to ' the advisability of reclaiming the
swamp lands 'granted â¢ by ! the Govern
ment of the -United States to the State
of California. : There remains 'unre
claimed ~bt the swamp lands of the State
about 1,200.000 acres. These lands are
in private ownership, and for the most
part arc held in large bodies, aggregat
ing in some instances .20,000 acres, and
if their reclamation Is found to be prac
ticable, they will fall", inevitably Into
still larger combination. "
It-Is proposed to secure the financial
assistance of . the Government of the
United States and the State of Califor
nia .in : this work of reclamation. " If,
when, these lands are reclaimed from
their present condition, and converted
into- gardens, no condition is imposed
that will -prevent their being held in
large bodies, but .'little" will 'have been
accomplished for the growth of popu
lation here. The monopolized condition
of these, the most fertile lands of the
State, will not be a legacy of the semi
barbarous conditions existing under the
Mexican occupancy, but will evidence
the deliberate Imbecility of our own
time.
Their profitable cultivation In large
holdings will demand a servile* labor.
The. owners of these lands will be the
persistent and influential advocates of
the introduction of a labor whose pres
ence will offer the competition of the
hovel of the Oriental with" the home of
the American. Government and State
aid In the reclamation of these lands
to be monopolized by the few holders
will be a misdirection of public moneys.
The question naturally arises as to
the remedy for the existing condition.
The defertllizatlÂ«>n of the wheat-grow
ing areas, added to the prevailing low
price of wheat, is forcing the policy of
breaking up some of the largest of
these holdings. But the high value of
this policy is somewhat belated. The
lands are obtainable only at prices of
from $40 to $So\ an acre. Hence, their
absorption .by small cultivators who
necessarily belong to the non-capitalist
class. will be slow. The subdivision of
these lands will proceed only upon the
demonstrated profit or the small hold
ing, and this profit has its guarantee
only In irrigation. A dry season of at
least seven months of each year is a
fixed and unalterable climatic condition.
These are the months of heat, and with
moisture are necessarily the most pro
ductive months of the year, :Wlth"irrl
gation, then, we bring into being, a
"as long as you behave yourselves.
There now, where is't?"'

pencils, penknives, cigarette ''cases â lay
on the shiny table along with the re
volvers . already , mentioned.
"Ye're humbuggin* us," said Mac
kenzie. "What's the use?" .^ . ;
"I'm; doing nothing of the sort,"
laughed . Raffles. "I'm testing you.
Where's the harm?"
S "It's here. Joke apart?"
- "On ; that table, by all my gods."
Mackenzie opened the cigarette cases
and shook each particular cigarette.
Thereupon Raffles prayed to be allowed
to smoke one, and when his prayer was
heard observed that the pearl had been
on the. .table much, longer than ..the
cigarettes. Mackenzie promptly caught
up the Colt and opened the chamber In
the butt. \ â¢
"Not' there, not there." said Raffles;
"but you're gettins*~hot. Try the cart
ridges."
\u25a0Mackenzie emptied them Into his palm
and shook each one at his ear without
result.
"Oh, give them to me!"

right one, had bitten out the bullet and

ever known â a productiveness whose
profit will be greatly augmented by
small holdings, density of population,
diversity of products and intensive cul
tivation.
. All property will sooner or later bÂ«
devoted to Its highest use. There Is an
inherent tendency in all things capable
of private ownership to pass into the
hands which can make their ownership
most profitable. Irrigation, then, is the
goal of the better system of land hold
ins and a .higher industrial condlton of
the State.
The Legislature of the State ros*
equal to this emergency by what might
be termed a compulsory, system of Irri
gation, by the enactment of what is
known in the. legislative history of the
State as the '"Wright Irrigation Law."
The principle upon which that law was
founded was unassailable. Being ex
perimental, it may have possessed many,
defects in methods of administration
and detail of plan, but these defects
were susceptible of remedy by the evo
lutionary process of experience and the
legislative remedies of amendment.
But the law was obnoxious to the large
land owners. They enlisted the mon
opolies of the country In the work, of
breaking down the law, and repealing
Its policies, and in the accomplishment
of that result, they committed a crime
against the highest and best Interests
of this commonwealth which will retard
its growth for many years.
There was no defect in the law which
legislative amendment could not have
remedied. The hostility which com
passed its defeat was founded in oppo
sition to the entire policy of irriga
tion, rather than to the specific policy,
outlined by the in w.
Wherever in this State systems of ir
rigation have been permanently estab
lished and Judiciously administered,
density of population has ensued. At
Riverside, upon 20,000 acres of Irrlgabla
land, a thriving and prosperous com
munity of 10,000 people is sustained,
possessing the attributes of the highest
American civilization. At " Fresno on
150,000 acres of irrigated land, a like
Industrial and civilized condition relates
to a population of about 35,000. There
is in the Sacramento Valley a million
and a half of acres of equally fertile
land, lying under equally Inviting cli
matic conditions, which under irriga
tion would constitute the basis of a
highly prosperous and civilized popu
lation of 1.000,000 inhabitants. A popu
lation of that magnitude would possess
within itself Industrial resources de
manding no supplement of inferior la
bor. The achievement of this popula
tion, within this great Irrigable valley
of the State, Is within the compass of
practicability, and when it Is accom
plished it. will present aspects of moral
and material well-being equal to the
highest that has ever, been" attained by.

understood and my teeth were set and
my nerves strung ready as I wrung that
strong and cunning hand for the last
time in my life.
How that last scene stays with me and
will; stay to my death! How. l see every
detail, every shadow on the sunlit deckl
We wero among the islands that dot the
course from Genoa to Naples; that was
Elba falling back on our starboard quar
ter, that purple patch with the hot sun
setting oAier It. The captain's cabin
opened to starboard, and . the starboard
promenade deck, sheeted with sunshine
and scored with shadow, was deserted
but for the group of which i was one,
and for t~e pale, slim, brown figure fur
ther aft with Raffies. Engaged? I could
not believe it. cannot to this day. Yet
there they stood together, and we did not
hear a .word; there they stood out against
the sunset, and the long, dazzling high
way of sunlit sea that sparkled from Elba
to the Uhlan's plates, and their shadows
reached almost to our feet.
Suddenlyâ an instantâ and the thing was
doneâ a t.Ang I have never known
whether to admire or to detest. He
caught herâ he kissed her before us all
then'flung her from him so that she al
most fell. It was that action wmch fore
told the next. The mate sprang after him
and I sprang after the mate. /
Raffles was on the rail, but only Just.
â¢'Hold him." Bunny!" he cried. "Hold
himtisht!"
And as I obeyed that last behest with
all my might, without a thought of what
I waa doing save that he bade me do It.
I saw his. hands shoot up and his head
bob down, and his lithe." spare body cut
the sunset as cleanly and . precisely as
though ,he I had plunged at hia leisure
from a diver's board !
Of what followed- on deck I can tell
you nothing, for I was not there. Nor
can my final; punishment,' my long im
prisonment, my everlasting disgrace
concern or profit' you beyond the in
terest "and advantage to be gleaned
from the, knowledge that I at least had
my ; deserts. But one thing I must set
down, believe it who willâ one more
thing only and I am done.
: It was into, a second-class cabin oa
the starboard side that I was promptly
thrust In â¢; Irons, and the door locked
upon" me a3 though" l were another Raf

and \u25a0 the sea scoured to no purpose, as Is
doubtless^ on record elsewhere.. But
either the'setting sun Cashing over the
waves must have blinded all eyes, or
else "mine were victims of a strange
illusion. /
For the boat was back, the screw throb-;

porthole acroxs the sunlit waters .that he
believed had closed forever over his com
rade's head. V Suddenly "' the sun ; sank be

fashion is Its Infinite variety and
its countless combinations. â¢No
doubt it does repeat Itself at
times, but the times are so far
apart that no one remembers the previous
existence of any particular fashion. Ac
cording to an ancient maxim, and a true
'one, "No pleasure endures unseasoned by
variety," and one of the objects of fash

ure. All. of which is preliminary to a
/rank confession that, although I tried in
a previous . article to exhaust the sub
ject of lingerie and summer petticoats,
yet I have since then encountered some
Eilk petticoats so lovely as to excite re
newed admiration and to warrant a fur
ther description. At the Lace House I in
spected the gontents of some boxes as
they were being unpacked, warm from
the Custom-house and laden with tariff
dues. They were alluring, darzling and
tempting, but ! only possible to those for
tunate enough to have lons purses or
large bank accounts.- In the Illustrations
te-<say an effort is made to give an idea,
of the eOctlxehefes of these garments.
but it Is difficult to bring out the detail
in the reproduction, and it will be neces
eary to follow the description to get even
a fair idea of these up-to-date silk lin
gerie petticoats. With our white, petti
coats thete is always the dread of the
expense of the costJy French laundry, and
it is not impossible that this feeling In
spired the Idea of a substitute that, al
though expensive at the outset, yet was
designed to avoid large and frequent
laundry billsâ the silk skirt. with a de
tachable flounce. There is no question
but that all garments hang and fit better
over eilk than over any other material,
which secures favor at once for \he new
ekirt_ One of the Ekirts which I shall
try to describe was made of strong taf
feta cf the most delicate shade of salmon
pink. It was tnade instep length, the
flounce being twenty-two inches deep and
made of very elaborate tucked organdie
end point de Paris lace. The top of the
flounce was made with tucked Van Dyke
points, which were outlined with baby
ribbon of a" salmon-pink color running
through beading and' tying at the upper
lefthand' corner of each point. At the
bottom -there is a ruffle of lace and
above the ruffle groups of tucks and
bands of Valenciennes insertion. At the
top of tha flounce Is a beading correspond
ing to the beading sewed on the skirt,
and through both of them Is run a piece
of ribbon, in order to make It possible
end easy to take off and put on the
flounce whenever It may become soiled.
This shifting flounce is a very great con
venience and comfort and altogether very
desirable. Under linen suits, the skirt
should match the cult, although white
skirts are always allowable and go well
with any color, but the organdie flounce
ever the colored silk is very attractive.
The next prettiest thing in lingerie
after petUcoats are corset-covers.
These are made In a great many styles
and shapes and may be, and frequently
are, very, elaborate. They are consid
ered nowadays very essential articles
of apparel, particularly since the "peek
a-boo" waists came Into vogue, and
they are. In' fact,, almost as much In
evidence as the blouse " itself. In the
illustration showing the* pink petticoat
the corset-cover worn with It is an ex
ceedingly pretty model and it Is one
that is. easily made at borne. The en
tire front. Is of all-over embroidered
lawn with a scalloped upper edge. The
embroidery is very, heavy and .very
handsome.' ' It buttons down the back,
which Is 'made' of fine lawn. and the
ehoulder straps are of inch- wide wash
ribbon tied In a big bow at the top of
the 6houlder. This style of ribbon
\u25a0traps Is particularly, attractive, as the
color shows so prettily under a thin
waist These very thin waists, which
are known by the name of "Peek-a
boo" waists, really require dainty rib-
bons and bright colors and pretty bows
beneath their gauzy surface. " ;' '
Pongee suits 'of tan color are being
worn a great deal this summer and al
most always they come without an; un
der drop skirt,' but it Is bejwnd ques
tion that the pongee skirt will riot* and
does not hang well over a white lin
gerie petticoat The underskirt must be
of silk, although up to* this j year ' silk
skirts have .not seemed to be suitable
for summer wear. \u25a0; Now, \u25a0-. however, 7 the
lingerie silk skirt; solves ; the
and even without- organdie-, flounces
they are so madeas to" look summery,
and appropriate. I saw, two skirts that
had been made especially to wear with
pongee suits. ; One of. them was ; a rich
tan heavy taffeta, made "tailor-made"
style and elaborately smocked;, and
tucked with 'a few stitched' ruffles; on
the bottom and all outlined with' gold
braid. It was simple, but at ; the same
time rich and s effective. ;- It appears â¢> in
one of the illustrations, showing at the
same time another style ..of . corset
cover. The latter is in , the v empire
style, and is composed of -two-Inch \u25a0'Val
enciennes Insertion sewed alternately
on to twelve-Inch" wide strips of : f very
fine French - nainsook, .with r largeVpink
bows on top . of^ttie shoulders, and. the
effect Is very pretty Indeed.* â¢ One- very
good feature of ; this corset-cover*,* is
that it is sure; to 'fit .well and the
shape oC the neck is especially becbm'
ing. \u25a0/.\u25a0 \u25a0â.. ,;..;,* ;'*.V-: ; .^V;.,:/'"^-' ;.;.
A little \u25a0 while . ago ,- 1 , spoke .'of making
corset covers at. home, which; reminds me
that handkerchief covers : are I also -very
easy to make at home, "and they are very
dainty, besides having the merit of being
very Inexpensive. ; With two. cheap hand
kerchiefs, costing only 25 cents each, a
serviceable and pretty cover can
easily be made. 7 Th- handkerchiefs' are
to be folded on the bias and cut In halves,
and one of these is Ito be cut in two in
the same way..- There /will 'now be, three
large halyesr /and Â§j two smaller, ' pieces
ready .to be joined .together to serve the
purpose>of a cover. . On . the two
hemmed " edges of /one' of "the larger
halves, Voverharid insertion one inch* wide;
for the- back, the point being Â«at the "top.
Overhand the .other, two large pieces of
handkerchief on either side of the lnser

and the raw! edge, at the top.' This will
make two pieces to" go under^the'arms.

that there is no place under the Ameri
can or any other flag where the expen
diture of a hundred or a hundred and
fifty thousand dollars will do so much"
good and bring such rich returns to
thousands who are starving faj- tho
comforts that this money would bring."
Ab to tho kind of a building and plan
of operation, I have given the subject
some thought. At one time the advocates
of tho plan thought of having it as an
annex of the American Club, but that
was thrown aside as impracticable, be
cause a place of this sort must be open
to the many women who need it, as well .
as to. the menâ and women in Manila are
much more in need of such a place. of re- '
sort and recreation than our women 'here
at home can understand.
The American Library has a â¢ fair nu
cleus for a library, and I am sure the In
telligent, liberal-minded men who com*
â¢ pose the â¢ commission â¢ would '. appropriate Â«
some money for the purchase ..of^books,
. etc., and they are very friendly with tho;
management of the; American -Library.
Therefore I would put it under the con- .
> trbl of that already" existing institution.
\u25a0 :I: I. think Americans .there \u25a0 would contrib
ute a fine site' fronting the Luneta.
Ifthink it would be well* to have large
grounds, with a tennis courtâ exercise is
badly , needed. 'The building should be
suitable for a tropical climate and a
credit to American architecture. "The soil
would prevent a deep basement I would
have the lower story of cement,' the upper "
of steel, with, If possible/ a ; roof garden..
Probably an Inner court, with verandas,
which would, serve largely, as reading
. rooms. ,
. In addition to . the library arid >\u25a0 writing
rooms, there should be a .'large assembly'--,
room for lectures, dancing,* private theat-.
ricals, etc. A gymnasium, swimming pool
âon the site suggested salt water coufd
'be easily obtainedâ tearooms, \u25a0 where -hot
and iced' tea and perhaps ices could be
served. A small charge for the* games
and refreshments should ; be made, for
those it would benefit are^not, of course,
in any sense objects of charity, but inde
pendent, self-respecting Americans.
1 would make it a clean, .wholesome,
pleasant resort for young women and

wealthiest cltlens" had Â£ .contributed
$10,000,000 "to promote a comprehensive
system of higher, education in the Uni
ted States." Good, let him or some one
like him give one per cent of ; . this
amount to building a free library, gym
nasium, swimming tank and assembly
room in Manila, and he will contribute
to the higher education, the moral
well-being and/social comfort and hap
piness of thousands r of deserving Amer
icans, and :such an ; institution would
teach the Filipino something of how
wo do things in the United States.
' "We have a. distinguished philanthro
pist who has given 1 millions for the es
tablishment^ of free ; libraries . all . over
the United States and even in Europe.

and Intelligence have brought lo them
1 CONFESS without apology that I
am an enthusiastic advocate of
any practical plan to establish a
public library and gymnasium In
Manila that shall afford Innocent,
wholesome, decent j recreation and di
version to our exiles there.
My personal observation during the
time I ' was stationed there has con
vinced mo not only of its desirability,
but of the crying need for It.
Any one who takes an interest' in the
moral, intellectual and social well-be
ing of the young American men- and
women* in Manila would be an ardent
advocate of such a plan if \u25a0'. he really
knew the conditions there; if he real
ized. the dearth of ; Innocent amusements
and recreations in that far-off land; if
he could see the many temptations that
surround the young. people we send out
there; if he couldbe made to feel how
much those who are inclined to live
and do right need our helping hand 'In
that morally and physically debilitating
climate. . ,
There arc in Manila to-day hundreds
of young American men and women â
clerks, stenographers, teachers, soldiers,
printers â who are cut off from all the
ordinary social and elevating environ
ments that surround young, people at
'\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 ,\u25a0. \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0
home, 1 ; to whom such an v institution
would be a veritable godsend.
At prcsont there Is the American Li
brary, satisfactorily presided over by
Mrs. Egbert, widow of a gallant colo
nel',, who gave his life in defense of our
institutions, but it is a feeble thing, un
worthy, of : our great free-llbrary-buud-
Ing people, at one time sheltered! in' a
few Darnlike rooms, now housed In a
corner of a Government building.
. Just \u25a0 v think : of it! Americans have
been in possession of the Philippine Isl
ands for seven years, and in the only
great city there they have not yet- erect
ed a single building that would bo a
credit to a country village. Thero is
not a decent place of amuscnymt, not a
decent hull where they can : attenil lec
tures. not a-muscum, not a park, unless
the so-called Botunlcal Garden of a few
acres-could be so called, but that would
be an awful stretch of the imagination.
Clerks are - 1 herded in uncomfortable
board Ing^liouses or enjoy tha but little
greater luxury of messing together over
their stables.
' lam speaking of the mass. '.'A few
have their families with them, or board
and; cannot â¢ get a light drink. And men
gathering: tojjether In a drinking^ place,
.whether; It . Is club . or saloon, will,: ooch,
through the obligation of good fellowship,
feel It Incumbent on him to orderarbund
of drinks, and thus they > will . all I drink ;
more than they; care for and Is good for
.thetn,-\ when. If , they. -'gathered, together In.
some place where the '. opportunity;' to
drink wa? not at , hand,. they : would ; be as
well satisfied; for;thelr main- purpose Is
fellowship,'. not the pursuit of drunken
"What Manila needs is not more clubs
with; exclusive; memberships, not a post
library merely; for' the soldiers, not
amusement places that, are merely, pri- .
vate money-making enterprises, but a
single institution combining : all the feat
ures enumerated, that Is adapted both to f
the climate and the conditions of life
there, an Institution, that Is public, dem
ocratic, thoroughly American hv. char
acter, to which^ the soldier, and civilian
alike can go, and to which every self
respcctlnu "American man 'and' woman In
Manila can turn -for ..Â« relief ' -from, the ."
tedium of â¢ lif v there and solace In home
sickness. 'â¢
"It doesn't matter' a great deal how
Manila gets such an institutionâwhether
by! Government appropriation, whether by
gift from some of our philanthropic mil
lionaires, or by popular subscription. The
.Important thing Is that she gets Itâ and
gets it very soon, for the sake of our
exiles there.",'
' What General Woodruff says about the
needs of our people In Manilaâ OUR peo
ple, rememberâ is what General Frederick
Funston, what General . King has said;
what every American officer who has
studied the condition and' needs of
Americans i In Manila has said with more
or less insistence.

I do not believe that an Institution of
this kind should be for the benefit of
army and navy oilicers, .higher officials
of the civil Government and well-to-do
business men, as In that case it would
not bo patronized by those who. need it
most. Men of the classes mentioned
above often have thulr families with
them, have their own social circles, and
in most cases are members of some one
cf the several excellent* dubs in Manila.
This institution, If founded, should be for
the benefit of those not so fortunately
placed. It should be a distinctly public
institution of the characteristically
American kind.
NEED IS SELF EVIDENT

in that climate, or in the harmless, inno
cent nodal intercourse that Is so neces
sary to all people In all climates.
The result of this lack of wholesome
diversion and of having "no place to go"
that is fit to go to, Is. to say the least,
deplorable in its effect on American men
in Manila, and depressing to the Ameri
can women. *
A building *whlch' contained a reading
room well stocked with current maga
zines and newspapers; another room
which would be used for dances, private
thfatrlcals, lectures, etc.; a gymnasium,
a bowling alley and other attractive fea
tures would afford , many a pleasant
evening for people who, under present
IN my opinion the need of something
In the nature of a place of assem
blage > and of recreation and amuse
ment for Americans in Manila is self
evident. \u25a0 t, '.
In addition to a very considerable num
ber of soldiers, there are in that city hun
dreds of employes of the civil Govern
ment and of commercial houses, and not
a few Americana In business In a small
way- for themselves.
To these men and women Manila has
nothing to offer in the way of wholesome
diversions or amusements, no place where
they can epend an hour or two or three
la the iiKht exercise that la so necessary
you' do some precious kiddy's Noah's
Ark at Chrlstrnus time?
Of course it would be quite ah un-
Ãbuul institution, but an exceptional
thing, very different \u25a0'â¢ to ' the publlo \u25a0

where we liavo overythlnsclao so con- ]

people j in Manila â not ' only this year

The thing has been happening all
those seven years that we have had

How many young eagles have conn

high hopes have been shattered by folly!
How many have come creeping; home
wrecked by drink, by gambling, by .ln-<
discretions that have crown to scan

Think what you have read of these
things in the papers â and they are only,
the most flagrant cases. '
Think, too, of the hushed-up failures'
and scandals, the veiled wrecks ; that'

Fra Elbertus, .who has a pretty talent,
for putting up old truths in attractive;
now packages, tells us that most of tho,
wrongdoing, particularly the wrong
doing of youth, is the result of mis
directed energies.
Wo send. out to Manila so many, who
are young and cager â that's . the Â« kind
that wants to go, and is of real use
; thereâ arid, of. course, 'if, theyxan't find
: a wholesome outlet' for their energies,
they'll find the other kind.

\u25a0such a' place of resort?

i "there are, by rough estimate, between
â¢eight and ten thousand Americans there

gymnasium and to amuaa tlimnaolvo.s,
witli'Kuinea like bowling, shuffleboard
and blllliirds would be as welcome to
tho soldiers us anybody. Tho want of
such a thing foroos them to wander
tint streets and to try to find amuse*
merit In saloons and other undesirable
places, quite as much us any inclination
for that sort of thing does. The soldier
being just an ordinary man like other,
men. has a ta.stu for decent amusement,
and occupations as well as for the other
kind, and he'll let the other kind ulour
if he run get the decent hlnd.*3jÃgttiHQft

a place? '" ' ,
Then you nro mistaken.

whatever you may say of .him. is as
atixlou* to get a buth as any other man,
especially in that climate. . It would
be a luxury, it would be more than that
â it would be a blessing to have a
swimming tank with salt water to go
to.
Hut them would bo other features of
the plan proposed that would uppeal to
the Manila soldier. Don't think he

It should bo beautifulâ bs a matter of

It should havo plffÃant grounds around
it, Bud'.dt li'ust a tennis court.

the horses tied to the fence. The moon
was full, a pie ready to cut. The young
people withdrew themselves to play
"Wcavllly Wheat" and "Old Sister

about the past. Old Dan Mott said that

make this observation, it was sufficient
to establish him for the occasion as tiie

by a sandy haired fellow who had nar
rowly escaped the peniteniary. years be

charge of stealing a calf. Men who had
heard the saying a thousand times clap
ped their hands and one of them, as was
expected, cried out: "Why. Jake, when
did you rise up? We didn't expect that
much wit from you."
"You may fetch out all the wit you

fact that what 1 said is true. Life ain't

"And it never has been." spoke up old

"It sorter reads that way, but the Lord
knew what he was doin* in the first

â¢| ENRY CARROLL'S plight was a
1 \ perplexing one. It drove the
j I young lawyer Into a dogged de-
A 1 termination to get the girl in
*^ spite of herself. He bad had a
year of the ups and downs of a court
ship such as only Helen Ben ton could
have made so torturing, and yet sweet
ened by the hope of ultimate success.
The worst of It was that he really be
lieved that she loved him, though he
had no proof beyond the fact that she
refused other men right and left, was
suspiciously sweet to the other, girls to
whom he paid the least attention; and
treated him in a cavalier. fashion that
Indicated that she considered him her
property.
When he asked, as he did all too
often, "Nell, do you love me â at all?" she
would answer sweetly, "Do I act as -if
I did?" V*
He was obliged to admit that she did
not. Then ehe continued to laugh at
his courting and to turn him down
whenever she so chose.
One pleasant August afternoon he
sauntered to her home and Invited her
to go golfing. She loved golfing. He
found her under the trees In a ham
mock, in a dress of foamy blue ruffles,
with a cool blue cushion under* her
dark little head.
"Too hot," she answered, "and I m
too lazy. Besides, I want to finish; my
book." She picked up her novel, leav
ing himself to Infer that he" could
take himself off. He did â as far as the
gate â then he turned and walked back
to her.
"Helen," he said slowly, "do you in
tend ever to marry me or-not?" ' She
looked at him with apparent coolness;
until he made Solomon, one wiser than
any that had gone before; and I lay .'you
that the men stood about the throne
of Solomon looked back to the time when;
life was worth livin'â when man _ was
wiser and honester. The high point of
this world has always been passed. > But
the ' fact is that history hasn't yet got
out of the, sunrise. It will be thousands
of years yet before we reach the noon-,
tide. Creation is ; still rockin' in -the
cradle of its infancy. It may be a thou
sand years hence before man understands'
the full meaning of the Savior. You may
speak of this as a money-gettin' age, but
it ain't more so than when the Savior
was sold for silver. AH ages that :we
have any record of have been money
grabbln' ages."
"That may all be," remarked ojd Mrs.
Nancy Bales, "but It don't seem to me
that the cows give as much and as rich
milk as they did a long time ago. I was
talkin'- to my husband about it the other
night, and he was forced to agree with
me." ' ;,
"He want forced to agree, but was glad
to," Ltmuel answered. "And," hejadded,
after, a moment's reflection, "your grand
daughter's cow won't give" as mucn milk
as yours does, and I reckon . her grand
daughter's cows will dry up entirely."
"It wouldn't Burpriseme in the least,"
the old ; lady spoke up. "And ; what : the
something flickered to her eyes, then
wavered away.
: ; "I Intend not to," she replied.
"Do you love me? Does my love
mean nothing to you?" :'
"Make your own inferences, Henry
Carroll. Tell me why, I should: marry
at all ? I- am happy as I am ; .why .
should I want aâ man? ; Unless." she
spoke meaningly, "I ; could find . one
who could make me think I wanted
him."
"Nell," he said sternly, "do you real^

"A love!" she" interrupted. "A chance,

Â« vC; I'll stay here." John answered
A I briefly.
I The other shrugged his shoul-
V V ders, then passed out of sight.
VÂ» "Well," said Coflin, as the pump
slowed to a fluttering; stroke, "we are
ready."
Brady gave four light blasts of his
whistle. In answer came the upward
flash of three distinct white lights.
"Hope Til be able to see you at Wel
kin," said Cofiin. as. with a grim laugn.
he sprang lightly to the ground.
To a railroad man the incidents of
his first trip always remains indelible
photographs. John never forgot the
shaded cab light. 6trewlng Its white
raya ever a broad, blue-denlmed figure,
the tarllke scent of the trailing smoke,
the plunge of the racing crosshead,
rhyming with the rail click*.
"Now we are pitching over,** said
Brady, "let's give the valves a good oil
ing â may prevent them from tangling
Tip." A liberal supply having been
found to strengthen the cups, he con
tinued, after a culck glance at the
(round: "Ho seems to be holding
them." Then, as the train lunges vi
ciously downward, & culck succession
of whistles Coats back from Coflin.
Brady opens his stopcock, the pointer
Quivers below Birty; under the com
bined efforts o- both reservoirs, it
creeps slowly up. As it passes sixty
five the speed of the released train in
creases with avalanche fury. The old
Cooke. rolling over her flying, rocking
against the sharp curve, soon becomes
a thing of 6lapplng bell cord, of pitch-
Ing lunges, of ghostly 6tunnlng, gmashr
lug recolL It Is with the utmost dlffl
culty that Brady â thrown one second
against the elde cf the cab, then
against the straining boiler.â can keep
the wrench In the pitching plug. As
the pointer nears seventy It takes a
quick downward sweep, a Jerk closes
the cock, then^vrith lips drawn in a
straight line, he stands, awaiting. the
result. The rear wheel of Coflin's tank
is encircled in a red glow of spitting
flre, a glance back up along the sinu
ous lunging .shadows racing In mad
riot Ehow a like evidence of effective
braking In drlftl"c light or dull glow-
Ing shoes.
John calls out from his Bide: "We are
eure!y going some."
"Yea, going, that is Just it." growls
Brady. Then as the air is with
driving coal from Coflin's tank the first
long call for brakes rings out against the
night. Brady's lips close tighter as he
lays h!s hands upon the reverse lever, its
rigid strain appajs him. Xhere is jio
standing in the narrow cab now, so lean-
Ing over the boiler, he, with both- hands,
clutches the heel of the throttle. John,
from hla side, Jcins him, the two heads
beb grotesquely, one moment touching,
the next two feet apart. Then, as a sec
ond blast rings out, to be quickly suc
ceeded by & third. Brady says:
"Out on the boiler, John. .Get a good
hold on the sand rail. Be quick, she is
ready to throw her rods."
The photograph added to John's collec
tion In the next minute was of the kind
which tinge and shade a soulâ the awful
rush of the almost visible air, the rough
dance of the canyon tops against the
blurring Bky, the dull pungency of burn-
Ing oil, the reeling footboard beneath his
feet, and the hammer blows of the slen
der rod bending under his handsâ the kind
that memory retouches In Blnew-crack
lug dreams. A strong hand falls upon his
shoulder In a moment and he is seated
astride the boiler, clutching the bell
frame looking Into the white face oppo
site. 'S':~. .
A crash eounfis above the tumult, then
Cofiln'a cab arches like a crushed egg
shell, for a brief second the air is filled
with eplinters and fragments of Iron.
John catches a glimpse of a swirling
blanketlike thing plunging amid the de
bris. In a paralysis of horror he sees it
crash against a Jutting rock, then, as
they fly by, to drop hands, wildly clutch-
Ing; face battered Into a pulp back under
the train. .
"Look, John!" cries Brady, "that was
Coflin. Must have been on the running
board when the rock let go. Poor fel
low, he Is through, though, and John. I
fear our time Is not far off."
The words were drowned In a crash
from beneath. Cab and running board
meet under the fierce blows of clang-
Ing, flailing steel. The two sit, white
faced., with staring eyes, as the engine
Bhlvers over the awful impact. Tons
of eteel crash Into the river or against
the rock. Then in a moment the dls
znounted machine Is riding like a skim
ming yaciiU The vibrating lunge has
disappeared. Brady says, a gleam of
hope in his face:
"John. I think there is a show for
us. Since she has strapped herself 'she
rides like a Pullman." Here a water
tank shot past. '
"John, we are . down, there is Artie
at the foot of the ascending grade.
Boy, let's never forget that God for
some reason has seen fit to spare us
from poor Coflin's fate."
John nodded in grave solemnity.
The terrible speed was now percepti
bly decreasing, but it seemed a long
time before the rqueaklng. grinding en
gine comes to a stop. A quick exam
ination developed that of both engines
literally nothing was left but wheels
and boilers. All rock entirely gone, top
guide yokes driven, up against the.boil
ers, cylinders ruptured into a Jugged
mass of ecrap. and eccentrics and
valve gear as if they had never existed.
"The Inter-Hountaln got out lucky'
on the deal." Â«aid Brady. "Two dis
mantled engines and a dead engineer is
better than they usually check out, but
I'll ccc how much water Is in poor
Coflin's boiler. As he emerged from
the broken cap he . Bald,' "She is, all
light. Three gauges solid and a light
fire. We had better go back to the
rear. The-boys cut off the caboose be
fore Coflin gave the third whistle, and
they might have run into us." Â»:
As they stumbled back, blinded In the
torch gloom. Brady counted the cars, re
marking as they came to the last, "Thlr
ty-eeven; we have got them all; but there .
comes the caboose." â¢ ; 'â¢ .-: 7,

but being unable to run up to the train
It came to a stop at a little distance.
Torches and lanterns met halfway. Then
to stand fitfully Illuminating Bix white
faces. Healey extended both hands, say-
Ing, In a 'trembling, broken voice.
"No man, unless placed as I am, could
Imagine how glad I am to see. you both
alive. It makes the burden of my crime
that much less. Yes. Brady, crime is
what I said and mean. A few weeks
since I lost more money than I could
afford at a one-horse, tln-norn joint, des
perate in a determination to win out I
borrowed money from, the proprietor, giv
ing a thirty-day note -with . the under
standing that I could have favor in the
way. of extensions, etc. The fellow dis
counted it at a broken dive, then hit the
trail. .The party, in -whose hands it fell
has been after my scalp for ytars and
is forcing payment by threat of turning
It Into the office with full details of the
way of issuance. Of course, you know
what the resujt would be. Now, .old
Adams up ther& got- on to. my scrape In
some way. To-day he asked \me how
much I lacked to take the paper up.
When I told him he offered to give me
the amount required If I 1I 1 would move his
accumulated cars. To deceive you boys
he put up a fake letter, from Mr. B â ,
as I see -now; pretended to allow,me'to
get It Into my possession. ' ';'V;
After we cut the caboose olt we dropped
slowly down, expecting to find you piled
on each succeeding curve. At Deadman's
Elbow we ran over poor Coflin's mangled
body; it's in the car now, and, boys, I
wish to say right here before you all that
I am as guilty of that murder as If I had
pulled the. trigger of a .4 1 shoved between
his eyes. Coflin was .too well posted not*
to be aware ,of the danger of. what he
undertook, but he thought old man-By
wanted it tried, and thaÂ£"was enough. '
"I think that we were all in 'ft;*'- re
plied Brady.. "Any railroad man would
havt) known that a letter of tjiat.klnd
was no good. Had Mr. Bâ â - desired
the thing we would have heard, of; it
after the details had â¢ been thrashed
out, and then only through the chan
nels of our immediate superiors." .'â¢
"Thank you," said Healey. laying his
hand on Brady's shoulder, "I see. you
are ' the right sort and in it", us deep
as Ccflin, but nothing could .change my
sense of responsibility.,. Til stay- in
2 Welkin, until poor Tony i 3 iiburied.
Then, after . a conference with""; !Mr.
B , in which I'll put him onto. the
whole racket, I'll light out for! Mexico.". *
A brakeman was sent back :to Huron
to wire Welkin for power to move the
disabled engines and train. Late in the
morning two backing engines coupled
to them, easily hauling the long train
into Welkin by noon. A group of men,
â¢with lowering 1 brow and ominous eyes,
heard Healey's frankly 'told ' tale In
crave silence, and when : at its conclu
sion he held the fateful bill fluttering
above his head, crying hoarsely, "See
the price of a man's life, and may God
judge between the hand who gave and
the hand who received," the savage
answering growl boded little good to
a white-faced man even then, heavy
grip In Jiand, boarding the east-bound
flyer at a little flag station, ending a
steep Huron trail.
In a few days Howe joined them and
was placed upon Healey's vacated run.
Then \u25a0 followed many days under whose
magic John Gray strengthened and
broadened into a man; days whose bright
rims dropped with the rich wine of
youth, followed by nights swift and
sweetâ the" forging of a life- In the fur
nace whose flames are danger, devotion,
and dutyâ hours forming the links of
chains destined to crush, the heart
strings in the evil days of trembling
hands and whitened . hair, as from the
heart of the fire will come to a dodder
ing brain the remembrance of the days
when all things were as feathers in his
hands, when the lightest laughter chimes
with his. and the world was good, young
and bright. \u25a0 -; . * \u25a0\u25a0 'â¢
One October afternoon j two years later,
as they came to; a stop on . a "dump
track," the caller handed Brady a pa
per, who, after a slow perusal, stood si
lently twirling it in his fingers. -
"What Is it," asked John, mischiev
ously, "another jacking-up over excess
oil, or ten days for exceeding speed
limits?"
Brady returned no answer, but eat
moodily staring out across the yard.
Finally, with an effort, he pulled himself
together, extending the paper, and said,
a Bad tremble In his voice:
" "I knew It would come some time, and
John, I'm afraid I'm more sorry than
glad." â. ... '\u25a0:\u25a0:; \u25a0\u25a0'"- â¢''â¢?'
John's surprised eye fell upon the fol
lowing:
"Brady: Notify your fireman. Gray, to
present himself at my office at 9 a. m.
to stand examination for. engineer.. I. I."
A ; little later the. Uintah contingent
bade a semi-serious 1 farewell to the. de
parting pair. â¢
"Well." said Brady, as they sat at the
open windows of the day coach, "we are
launched at last. Now, Gray, we are up
against it. From what those boys say
that Huron branch' must be a hard' game.
When men like those fellows dub It a
terror, it is well to believe them: We
are badly, handicapped. Uphill you are a
green fireman, and down I am equally
verdant as an air brakeman. To the
initiated this should mean stalling, blow
ing up. and doubling with sidetrack cars
and engines on the descent. We will
probably have a train crew who are on
to the connections, and who are used to
first-class service from the engine crew.
Now It's up to-us'to make the bluff of
our lives. Take your cue from me, and
above all don't let the head brakeman
mistrust you as new at the business.
Those ducks are, in their minds, the self
tfpnstituted critics of all enginemen, and
In too many cases' the final court of ap

so if we have trouble for steam, I'll chip
Inâ leaky steam pipes or played flues with
a little mysterious comment on loose noz
zles, striped pipecoat pipes. or dropped
cornersâ and this will put you Into the
clear. Now, John, while we are on ] the
topic I want to tell you something. You,
as my fireman, are to be the only man on
the train.
"Old Mike Peyton, for whom "I did the
mosfof my firing, had an idea that suit
ed me so well as a fireman that I've used
it as an engineer. It's this: The boy in
the deck, if he knows his business. Is .the
most Important roan on the train.. :
\u25a0 '-'it's extremely easy for the 'eagle eye*

to the front; It's used to make an artlfl-'

' the*, exhaust. \u25a0v In . building or breaking

rupted task. - -Â» After five minutes' hard,
work he paused , and said: "Look there,
now. See, the flre Is level and burning
bright. Now; take tae shovel and put In
thirty scoops of coal, beginning at the

Here John . awkwardly threw In his

ing, dryly. ; "Look In there." pointing to
where a "heavy black mass, lay smoking
in, the center of the firebox. "I told you
-to. cover the entire flrebox with about
thirty, scoops; well, the way you have
begun -would,- require about a ton of
coal to do It. Now catch. your scoop In
this way,' only use the right hand at

the coal with it alone; then when* you
draw the scoop back to you, catch It a
little down the handle, by the left hand,

fulcrum both In raising and pitching.
Now : learn to raise the front of the
scoop, and hoist the coal over It. .Now
watch me. I am going to . cover about

John followed the strong right wrist as
It quickly forced the scoop under, the
edge of the coal barrel to Jerk It quickly
out heaped with thirty pounds of v coal;
then with the swift left swung - under
the handle, a quick easy Jerk, Brady
said proudly, "look In."
John obeyed. A thinly scattered black
shadow, through which slim spirals of
blue gas flamed strongly, ran along the
leftside. ,

laughing voice. â¢
Turning, they looked upon the speaker.
He was a heavy-set, smoothed-faced man
of about 30; in his eyes the humorous
twinkle of one upon whom the responsi
bilities of life sat lightly. '
"I" suppose you fellows are to form a
crew." "All right." he added to Brady's
nod. "You had best put old Pat out of

"And it's here v ye. are,"- he said wrath
fuily. "and ' meself wearing, my legs â¢ Into

to leave on a double-header by 6 o'clock.
" "All right," replied Brady, calmly. - "I
see nothing to prevent It Where Is your
oilhouse?" â¢
- McGahee pointed out \u25a0 the requested
building. .
Brady sprang quickly upon the engine,
and turning back the lid of a long box on
the lef t . side of the tank, produced in
rapid succession a tin bucket and three
large â¢ cans, â¢ then in a new, crisp voice
said. "Take thtse/over there, John, and
get your rations. The oilhouse keeper
will * show you how to make out your
tickets."
Before John had gathered the " cans
Brady was incased in his overclothes and
cap, wrench and all. and oil can In hand
was busily engaged upon the rear rod
cup." . , .
l 'At the swift decision of word, and
deed r the foreman and engineer ex
changed "glances : of pleased â¢ approval.
After a reference to a slip of paper the
foreman said: _
"Your name Is Brady, I see from this
message. "Now, I'm f oreroan^here, and
there. Is your captain, wao will sure
lead engine with you to r day. Look out
for him., The best lean say for. him, is
that he knows his business, but when
you strike town shake him, and hard."
Tho two young men clasped hands
warmly, Brady saying to McGahee:
"Your comment would suggest a very
limited acquaintanceship. Thanks. I'll 1
keep an eye on him." â¢ : \u0084
."You'd 'better if you wish a cent.ln

laughed the foreman-.. with an .ominous
shake of his head. ' "Now,' Brady, you

mock seriousness. "I came In; here. last

; After" John had accomplished his bld-_
ding he resumed, "Now put on your,

cover your grates and keep your flre
level." â¢ \u25a0 â¢ ..
Here Coflin backed against them,
after coupling the hose, and every-,
thins being found right, Brady required
him ahead, saying to John: "Ring your'
bell," and never forget to do It at. all
times before an engine Is moved. It's
a warning that never should be disre
garded."
John sawed away vigorously, at the
bell cord until Brady said: "That will
do; it's the business of the man ahead.
You can resume your toll when wa are
backing down upon the train." ,
John desisted, then stood in half
angry bewilderment.. The stern com
mands and the assumption of conferred
right to swift, unquestionable obedience
was as. an extremely undesirable reve
lation. In all of his former life no â¢.
one bad assumed this method of ad- y
dress. As he pondered It over Brady
again spoke In the same tone of quick
command: "We are backing up now.:
Get up on the seat box and, watch
your side of the curve. Ring the belL" .
"Confound the bell. I forgot It," said
John contritely, as be hastened to place
himself In a position to watch his side
of the track. Here a brakeman boarded
the engine, saying, "Walt herÂ©-, until,
the donkey gets In. some cars." t ' â v
After they had 'stopped Brady â¢ sat * si- *
lently for a moment surveying the flushed
face opposite, then with a queer ring In
his voice, said. "John," you ' made use oS
an expression a moment since that is no
part or parcel of a railroad man's equip- \u25a0
ment. - Under no. circumstances use It
again. 'I forgot* Is. a hideous monster,
whose only place Is in the darkest and
most hidden corner of your brain. "Never
forget that he is always lurking -there
waiting for a careless or unguarded mo-^
ment to crush your soul and life In the
hell of bitterest remembrance.
"A man can smash rolling stock, burn
engines, lick superintendents, or even en-: i
gineer strikes, and- yet live to sea glasa
windows behind him, but the ; man who
acquires the reputation of forgetting will '
be shunned by all concerned as a sunken
rock in a harbor entrance, an ever pres
ent sower of danger and menaced de
struction. But they are warning us
back." 'John- did not "forget'" the bell
cord. - ' ' -
After coupling to the train. Brady
swung out into the gangway and gave
the fire a critical. glance. "That is a gqod
flre," he said; "try to keep It level and
below the door. Thl3 coal ts free turning
and will probably burn a red flre: try to v
cover the white spots and you will hit -
the - combination." -Here Coflin said. 'â¢'â¢
"Come down, we want to talk with you." '
At the corner of the tank stood a young'
alert Individual, abstractedly slapping a f
handful of. waybills against Its sides as
he listened to a volleying stream of words
from a protesting yet decisive speaker.-.
In the first Brady met<hl3 conductor, Jim? 3

I V I feelings, because v.c have betn
'>Â» I pretty good friends since the
time we occupied colls in j?.Il
in Fiance. After our hard and bloydy
light at ChantlUy, the French cops ar
Â»cttÂ«C us. It was a long way from Bos
ton Common. I hadn't recovered from the
chill i sot fighting In the rain ami mud,
xv.d Mitchell was sore inside and out
becacee of the clouting 1 had handed
him. I was pretty lonesome and when 1
growled at the turnkeys they pelted me
witii parleyvoos I couldn't undersranu.
Mitchell could talk a sort of ham-strung
French that the keepers cou'.d puzzle out.
but he wouldn't say much to me. I tried
to get Charley to be nice and talk for me,
but at first he wouldn't say much that
was fit to print! I felt the chill c lining
back for another call, and when Charley
found that It was necessary ior me to
have some brandy, he plgeon-Frcnchcd
the news to the keepers and they, like
good chaps, produced. Mitcheil took a
hooker himself and it eased his wounds
so that before we yot our release we were
pretty good friends. Charley is a good
mixer. When we got free of the dun
geons I invited Mitchell to have dinner
with me. ar.d he accepted the call, as ha
had a healthy British appetite along.
"There'll be no sparring across ' the *
table," was the condition Mitchell put' on
the dinner invitation.
"Not any," said I. "I won't even throw
a plate at you."
That eatins contest was to a finish
and those who saw us put away the foctl
declared it a draw.

mixer." In my time I have met all kinds
of people, from Teddy and the present
King of England down to One-Eyed Con
nolly, and with, all I've oetn able to
sliake-a-day-day and break even. AH the
rren in my business who have stayed long
before the public were feilows who were
able to make themselves popular when
out of the ring. Jeffries never had many
strong friends, although winning' many
admirers by his work. Fitz has been
popular and is always a good card
whatever he does, Corbett's hat-band
was always spreading and he passed out
early. Jack Dempsey held his thousands
of friends till the end. >
T am having happy days right along,
because I made friends who stuck. Per
haps I paid full prices for popularity, but
I'm satisfied. Every town I hit on my
travels there are friends waiting with
the glad hand, and the icy mitt I've
never felt. Had I been a prig In the days
when the goose was higher it would have
been down and out for yours truly long
ago. '\u25a0.''â¢-*\u25a0;? v
My Idea of a good mixer is the man
who is Governor of my State, little old
Massachusetts. He is going to sidestep
politics, and I guess the reason is because
he don't like to play favorites, even for
his own side. He's a Democrat who's
been Mayor of his town, where there was
a majority of Socialists. His private sec
retary and right-hand man Is a Republi
can. He's a capitalist who gives labor
a chance for the money. He's a church
member who can meet the ward worker
on easy terms. Don't you think a man
\u25a0who can mix this way is going to do well?
Bure thing. The worst start in life to
give a boy Is to convince Mm that he's
too good to play with boys who may not
have as many grandfathers as he has.
It is because we are a nation of good
mixers that we beat the world In every
thing that's worth while.
GunfishterK Obliged to Go to Work.
As the gun fighters have about all left
the West for jobs as United States Mar-
Ehals In New York (see Bat Masterson's
finish) or to the Wild West shows of Co
ney, the habit of carrying guns In their
pants is being dropped by the men out In
the "Western country. I've been in all
parts of the West during the past few
months, and em now in the far North
west, and I have come across very few
gun-carrylng citizens.
"We're too busy making money," they
tell me, "and. besides, the hardware is
heavy and sure uncomfortable to pack."
There's less danger of getting your skin
full of lead in the West than there Is
right on Broadway, New York, where the
lid Is off. Whenever I see a man carry
ing a gun. 1 think of a little man who
worked with me in Boston years ago. He
had a revolver in his pocket all the time
and he insisted that it was protection
against bigger and stronger men. One
day a big husky chap came into the place
*nd pot Into a dispute with my little
friend with the gun. , The gun carrier
was pert and snappy and when the con
versation reached a loud stage., the. old
fighting talk of "You're a liar" w-as pop
ped at the big man. As he jumped . in to
t moke the little chap cat, his words the
gun was hauled out and the big man had
to crawfish. .
"There, didn't I tell you my gun would
come In handy?" said the little rooster
to me. "If I didn't have my revolver
handy that chap would have knocked my
bead nS."
"If you didn't have a revolver you'd
pever call him a liar," eald I. '.'Yog, would
have acted man-fashion towara him and
there wouldn't be any need for him to
knock your head off."
They ;;re more polite out "West than
>hey were and the bad men have gone to
work at something or other.

This ducking and dodging by Britt tc
avoid meeting Battling Nelson make;
me uneasy. Britt gives several reasons
why h6 can't meet Nelson, and all of
teem are worse than poor. lie says that
the poor showing the Dane has made in
six-round flshts In the East with Abe
Attell and others is ono reason. ' Nelson
is no pink tea scrapper. He must go
twenty rounds or more to show what lie
can do. It" he challenges Britt for a
linish fight with a side bet of 510,000. as
I understand he proposes to do, Britt
will have to stand for it or get the hoo-.
hoo from the Â«>orts. . .
Britt is keeping books, more than he if
fighting. lie is going to pick up somÂ«
easy money rather than try to earn some
coin lightins Nelson. His dream thai
Nelson Is not a drawing card because
he has lost some six-round games of tag
won't co down with the scientists of
scrapping, for there isn't. any better card
anywhere than this same Dane.
These California list artists do know
how to do acting. Britt is going to get
all the proiit he can out of ' his punch
before he takes any chances of letting a
hardy worker like Nelson rope him into
a lons argument and do him up. Of
course, this is the new way of doing
business, and _it is a copy of the five
years' game of hide-and-seek Corbett
played with Fitz before the nonest black
smith got in where the lady wore the
belt. But I can't get used to it, no matter
bow often I see the game worked. â¢ i
A fighter ought to fight nnd light the
best men he can get at. same as we used
to do in the old .days, before light money
became tainted with all sorts of chippy
schemes. There are so m^ny fakes put
up by boxers nowadays that the pro
moters of wrestling In New York are
thinking of barring all boxers from meet
ing wrestlers, because nearly all of these
meetings ha? turned- Into a swindle. A
piÂ«-tty pass for the ancient and honorable
came of punch. Isn't It?
Finish Flzht Omclit to Conn- fn Again,

I have been told that I am to blame
for this fashion of limifr-d bouts- because,
when I made my tour of the country, of
fering $1000 to Tiny sport who could stand
before me for four rounds, that was the
start of limited bouts. Don't' swallow
that dope: Those bouts were" all finish
fishts, for I made them so, every man
who reached for that hunk of "money
going down and out before the "limit"
was reached. This four-round idea was
partly the invention of Billy Madden,

la a reunion of the Sullivan familyâ that
Is, all the Sulllvans. You hear of re
unions of the Saltonstall family, of the
Jones family, of the Smith family, and
so forth, but what tribe can show up like
the Sullivan family?
The Sullivan* the Greatest Vtxut
Family.
There are enough of .'.us Sullivans to
repel an army, and we're always ready â
or the Sullivans could go up and taks
Canada without asking help from any
other first family. There are Sullivans
enough to fill every position you may

salary of $23,000. There are SulUvans of
all grades, in between .these two samples
and I hope some day to see the family re
unitedâif there is any place bis enough,
to hold us all.
Let all the Sulllvans take hold and fcely
this thing along. I propose*Â»that a society
be formed under the name of the Amal

love to Join 'such a family reunion and

are the prettiest, the wittiest of any, and
they raise families large enough. to Â»ult

Did you see where he and Bryan had a
conversational set-to in .the Wnlte
House? Billy ' might hava " sidestepped

Chicago, a few years ago (and af
terward denied It ) that he, expect
ed somÂ§ day to have* to shoot such
men as Bryan on the field of bat-

Teddy. â¢ the . undefeated champion In
hia class, and Billy, the peerless scrap
por of the prairies, would look good in
a 20-foot ring. If they would agree
to settle the. Presidential battle in 1903
with hard gloves, cutting out the kero
sene oil and the speeches, I'd be willing
to referee it.
Vrjnn I* a Game Young: Grandfather,
Always on the water wagon and In

he and yours truly are thÂ« greatest
caters in this country. Roosevelt la
happiest when he is giving or taking
right swings, and has never yet been
defeated in the political ring.
Perhaps they agreed to some such
plan a.i this during that two hours*
meeting in the- back room of the "White
House, which so de-light-ed the Presi
dent. Anyway, Bryan had no sooner
got out of the "White Htfuse than Roose
velt sent for Professor Mike Dwyer to
come on at once and resume giving 1 him
boxing and wrestling lessons. As for
Bryan, he made a beellne for New Ha
ven to get some of the Bennett moneyâ
for training expenses, I suppose.
While I am talking of fighters, a word
about the three-cornered debate over
Fitz. Tommy Ryan and Jack O'Brien,
and the middleweight championship. Fits
has a stronger mortgage on the title than
Ryan, because be won It from Jack
Dempsey. and nobody nas yon It away
from him. although Tommy Ryan's press
agents think they have presented It to
Tommy. But as a right smart fact (as
we say in St. Looey), there will be no
real champion In this class until there Is
at least one fight for It. When Flu took
the title from . Dempsey, the high mark
for the middleweight class was 154
pounds.* Now Fitz says the weight limit
has shifted to 153 pounds. This because
the freckled one thinks he. Â«^n make
the latter weight. O'Brien offers to meet
Fltz at 15S, while Ryan Is doing every
thing but making ilt easy to get oa a
match that will come off.
John I-.'s Expert Oplalom.
Here's c the way It looks to me; JTlta
can't go back to 158 pounds. O'Brien Is
ready to â¢do battle and Ryan has too
many important engagements to settle
down with a forfeit that he will get Inio
a ring. "When I say Â» that I don't think
Fitz can get down to 153 pounds, I am
going by reports of his condition when
,he went to 160 a while ago to meet
Georga Gardner. They said Flta wasn't
fit at that weight, that all bis, bounce
was gone. But he Is a wonderful fighter
and can do- more freak stunts at chang
ing weights than any fighter that ever
i lived.
As for Fita going stale in the' ring, you
remember that he always- seems on the
point of a collapse Just before . he â¢ puts
his man to sleep. Have you forgotten
his fight with Corbett, when the crowd
thought â¢ Fitz was a goner? The first
Mrs. Fitz \u25a0 knew his ways and when It
seemed to . the J others } to be darkest for
him, Mrs. F. lovingly advised: "Push In
his slats. Bob, push in his slats!" And
he did.

SUPPOSE you suddenly learn that
you must earn your own living.
The Jirst thing to do is to screw
your courage to the sticking
point and face the practical situation.
Vuur ease admits of no wide choice.
You must lake the first even
Though it only secures for you your
board; but while in it lit yourself for
something better.
The "something better' is generally
seturcd by serving an apprenticeship.
But in what? We 3. there is nothing to
bt done but to knock at doors. BurÂ«ly
somebody knows somebody who wants
something done. If it is Bometlunz you
can do, do it But if It is something you
van't do. but would like to do, then
spend all your spare minutes learning
Ikiw 10 do it. 'Wheri" you feel yourself
capable, apply, keep on applying, for the
w>rk until you get it- A good worker
always wins; only the half-way proG-
V-ient find no place to "fit in.'J
Don't be afraid to say you want work.
Tell the fact to all your friends: tell
them cvcrylhins you know you cando,
and everything you hope to do, or think -
you might do. Aek your, friend*, to keep
you in mind, and si\;c you every sug
gestion they can for making a llvinff.
FBXDE A DRAWBACK ;
1 have a letter on my. desk nowâ a
<>iteous. pleading one, begging- me to
help the writer, who finds herself strand
ed. She is In San Frandkco, and she
writes to me in New York. The thought
occurs to me: "Why, ; lf. will be two
weeks before an answer , to this - can
reach her. She may be dead. Why did
sue not appeal to ber next-door neigh
bor?" Then I notice the postscript, that
Kays: "Please don't . let, anybody . litre :
know of my condition. My pride would
never stand such humiliation.", \ J, â¢
A woman like this will always hay* a,
hard timeâ once she begins to : bÂ« . un
lucky it grows on her so. ' SbV would
rather have me, almost a stranger, pay
her rent and twv her food than that
her neighbors should know she had no
money. Â£he would rather take charity
Â«f me than give her friends an opportu
nity of trying to put'her in the way of
making herself independent.
- "Ah. but when one. Is down, pile's
friends often melt ay/ay,'.' you say. That
may be. But be sure' and give' them the '
chance to "melt." Oftentimes, it is true,
jour very, best friends are powerless to
aid you', but unless you "talk things over
with them you will not even find that
out. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0;\u25a0- â¢ \u25a0-. â¢
PERSISTENdE WINS
Let me tell you that the, friendship of
persons who would think ill of you for
making air effort to earn your own., way,
rather than to ,rsst n dead .weight on
seme, disinterested acquaintance or rel
ative, is a friendship that "is better lost
than kept." Pride: thai will' permit you
to lean when you can just as well stand
alone is pride to be cot rid of. just
as soon as possible..
"There, were plenty of things- I s could
do," said one young woman to me, in
relating how she made a start in life;
"my diracult-,*, and it:is "the same with
almost every woman unexpectedly
thrown on her own resources, was to got
a chance to prove what I could d 0."..
"How did you manage?" ' .
"Why, I 'heard of a man who was on
the lookout for a woman who could han
dle fifty gfrU he had in' his employ. 1
knew I could do it; he thought. not, sirri
ply because 111 1 had never "worked before.
I worried, the life out of him 'until lie

â¢sake myself generally useful.' Well, in
short, I was* determined to be a neces

JACQUES I
A SUCCESS
AS A RULER
Sahara Flourishes
Under Lebaudy
of Paris.
Peace Established and
the People Well
Cared For.
Emperor Resorts to Practices
of Mohammedans on the
African Desert
Soeelfcl Ca.bl* to The Oil,
LONDON, July B.â Jacques L Emperor
of the Sahara, erstwhile known to fame
a* M. Lebaudy of Paris, and the reputed
possessor of far more money than brains,
Is now commonly regarded as a notoriety
seeking "freak" whose kingdom should
be restricted to the confines of a lunatic
asylum. That Is the way he Is usually
written up, but an Englishman who re
cently has had abundant opportunities for
studying Lebaudy at close range takes an
entirely different view of him.
W. L. de S. Lennox is his name and he
has just returned from a year's stay at
Troja. where the eccentric Frenchman
has established the capital of what he
dreams will some day be a mighty em
pire. Xor can it be said that Lennox has
any reason to be prejudiced in Lebaudy's
favor. Formerly an officer in the British
volunteers, he thought that he might be
able to eet a snug billet in the Em
peror's army. Ho didn't get it because.
he cays. he would not forswear his Eng
lish citizenship and turn Mohammedan.
He states that his Saharan Majesty is
a much underrated man. Instead of being
devoted to mere idle show, pomp and
vanity, he said that Lebaudy has proved
\u25a0 himself an energetic and capable admin
istrator, who is doing a difficult work in
an excellent fashion, transforming a bar
ren waste into a productive region and Jhr
troducing: law and ordcr"wiiefe"^bMgind
&ge wns formerly the fanfritd occifpation
of the people. â¢-' \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0'\u25a0' X
MAIXTAI.VS A HAREM.
"Jacques I," he said, "has done won
ders in a country that formerly produced
hardly anything and was wholly given up
to briganaage and poverty. Two years
ago. when he went to Sahara, the terri
tory over which he now rules was in a
.most primitive state. Now law and 'order
have been established there, schools have
been opened, an embryonic city of 6000
people has been brought into existence,
many acres have been brought under
cultivation and yield sugar, cotton, rice
and tobacco, while stores, granaries and
other improvements have been introduced.
"His empire is self-supporting and well
. governed. He himself leads a most indus
trious life and is the hardest worker in
his kingdom. His role is that of a bene
j Ccent autocrat. He has Installed French
men at the head of the various depart
.' xnents of his Government. They are prac
tical men and good organizers and havo
\u25a0 displayed remarkable tact in dealing with
the Arabs, who are naturally a most in
tractable people.
"It Is true that Jacques maintains a
harem, but hÂ« floes so solely because, to
obtain rerpect for, his authority, he finds*
It necessary to conform to the customs
tit his pÂ«ople. \u25a0 There Is nothing of the
libertine about him.' All the men in his
employ are given pay and rations suf
ficient to enable them to maintain three
â¢wives r.piece. \u25a0which, by the way, is only
half fixe regulation Mohammedan mat
, rimonial allowance. He wants no outside
interference and discourages the settle
â¢ rnent of foreigners until such time as he
has more fully developed the commer
cial resources of the country.
"There is now under the Emperor's
rule about 1000 square miles and a
population of something- like 12,000
people. Through his domains there are
constantly passing camel trains, orig
inating 1 In Central Africa. These cara
vans chiefly go to Morocco carrying
Ivory, cereals, flgs. dates, hides and
gold. Before he appeared these cara
vans were subject to constant depreda
tions by brigands. Jacques I exacts a
tribute from these caravans, It is true,
but in return he gives them military
escort, watering privileges at the wells
and full protection.
"The imperial army is composed o f f
Â£000 men, each with a camel, and a.
reserve force of â¬00. Every soldier Is
well equipped with the most modern
small arms. These men. as well as
everybody In the empire, can always
count on plenty to eat, which Is some
thing they could never do before. It
Is self-interest which binds them to the
new order of things. The national
faith *Is Mohammedan, which Le
baudy nominally professes, although
he is really a Catholic. Much -of his
power is exercised through the Mo
hammedan priests and force is never
used except to keep the peace. He Is
making French the national language,
using it in all official communications
and teaching it in the schools.
"He employs a great deal of cere
monial pomp and his durbars are
grand affairs, but this Is necessary to
properly Impress the Arab mind with
his importance. Agriculture is the
foundation of Lebaudy's scheme of em
pire. He is now getting two crops of
â¢wheat each year from 1000 acros of
land. This is to be doubled this year.
Up to the present time he has carried
on his operations only In an experi
mental form. These experiments have
resulted so favorably that he has de
cided to concentrate his efforts \u25a0: on \
â¢wheat, sugar and cotton; all under--ir
rigation, as there is plenty of avail
able j water. I expect to hear of his
exporting wheat inside of another
year.
"Troja, his capital, is a 'city of tin,'
the buildings being altogether of cor
rugated . iron, but he will soon com
mence Its construction In a -more, per
mnanent form. He has decided upon a
currency and . dies are being- cut - for
postage stamps.".

RELATIVE
OF HUGO IN

Brother-in-Law Is
in Deep Distress
at Parish i
Man Who Exposed the
Writer May Eeceive
Aid From Estate.
Jerome K. Jerome Once Again
Appears as. Friend
of Animals.
Special Cable to The Call.
LONDON, July B.â Victor Hugo's
heirs have Just been asked to con
tribute to the support of a brother-in
law of the great novelist, who forfeited
Hugo's friendship by exposing the state
of his domestic affairs. This is Paul
Cbenya, who at the age of 87, is re
duced to absolute poverty and lives in
Paris with his daughter in a single
room, the rent of which he is unable
to pay.
Years ago, when Victor Hugo was in
exile In Guernsey, Chenay, who was an
artist and engraver, met Madame Hugo
and soon after married her younger
sister. He and his wife were invited
to "Hauteville House," Hugo's Island
retreat, and remained there four years.
Then he removed to Paris and not long
after published a book about his
brother-in-law's menage. Of course,
Hugo's domestic arrangements could
not be written about truthfully without
giving offense and the author of "Les
Miserables" was so enraged at Chenay's
revelations that he declined to have
anything more to do with him.
In contrast with Chenay's "straitened
circumstances all the other. members of
the Hugo family are prosperous, ' and
Paul Meurlce, the novelist's executor,
has Just been asked what will be done
for the old artist. ; .
>3n such difficult situations,"*Meuflce
replied,' "In; which "our. interests or our
rancours conflict with â¢ our desire "to. pity
and forgive, I always ask "myself what
Victor Hugo would' have done in' my
place. In, this case there Is no. doubt
We know it from his own writings. I
am therefore exerting all my eloquence
to procure him a small monthly allow
ance and J am also seeing what I can
do for his daughter. Claretle has been
promised she shall have the first vacant
place as 'ouvreuse.' " - \u25a0 â¢ .
There is nothing so generous about
that, for it simply means that in future
folk who go to see Hugo's plays at the
Comedle Francaise are likely to have
their hats and coats taken by his
niece." . .
SHAKESPEAIIE AND THE LAW.
A discussion as to whether Shakes
peare was or was not once a lawyer's
assistant has" been started through a
chance remark of Lord Justice Holmes
of the Irish Court of Appeal. Com
menting recently on a case in which
the items of a solicitor's bill' of .costs
were subjected to judicial scrutiny, the
Lord Justice exclaimed:
"I believe Shakespeare was at one
time a solicitor's clerk, and he was a
man of great imagination, bik I do not
believe be could have improved on the
specimen before, me." â¢
Of course, that stirred up Shakes
pearean authorities. One of whom.-Sld
ney Lee, repudiates what he describes
as "the attempt to prove that Shakes
peare obtained employment as a law
yer's clerk." Mr. Lee attributes Shakes
peare's accurate use of legal terms '.'in
part to his observation of the many
legal processes in which his father was
Involved and In part to early . inter
course with members of the Inns of
Court."
The presence there of. Mrs. .tiora Annie
Steel led quite a number of folk who had
read her books to gather at the Helston
County Court, Cornwall, the other day
The author of "On the Face of the Wat
ers," who now makes her home at Tol
garth Hall, Montgomeryshire, was de
fendant In an action brought for $25 by a
farmer, named Davies. It seems that Mrs.
Steel has been wanting to find a site â¢In
South Cornwall on which to build a house
and asked Davies to select one for her.
His bill for making the necessary in
quiries was unpaid because none of the
sites he suggested proved satisfactory,
Mrs. Steel asserting that she had dealt
with him on the understanding that he
was a regular real estate agent. As she
had made no agreement,' however, and
the work had undoubtedly been per
formed. Judgment was* given in favor of
the Dlalntlff. The authoress elected -to
conduct her case Jn â¢ person and'dld so
with such skill as to be complimented by
the magistrate, Judge Granger, whoj Is
the son-in-law of another novelist ' the
late James Payn. '. <
Jerome K. Jerome has been known for
some time as the loyal friend of animals.
He took a prominent" part In f a crusade
against vivisection carried on in England
a year or co ago, and now has come for
ward with a protesV against the whole^
sale use which is made of spring traps in
this country for the. capture. of hares and
rabbits. There Is no question about the
need for exterminating these animals,
which are a pest to England, but Jerome
thinks some other; means might be" em
ployed than the present one, which he de^
scribes as excruciatingly painful."; ~.
It seems that the author has gotten his
impression "first hand," i for he ' tried the
traps by wilfully Imprisoning * his own
finger in one. . : \u25a0â¢
"I must ask you ,to \u25a0 believe,", he says.
In. a letter to tho newspapers on tho sub
ject, "that ; I am : fairly I plucky, at \ bearing
pain. I have had my. share of . it \u25a0 in .1 vari
ous forms and from those I who; know, me
I could ' confidently ask c for 'a testimonial
on this point. _ , Well, ' I allowed, my/ finger
to remain ; in the trap \ for: three . minutes

LONDON, July B.â Typical of the hor
ror, of Innovation and the love of prece
dent which are striking charateristics of
the British House of Commons is its of
fice of Speaker, on which public attention
has been focused by the recent retire
ment of William . Court Gully and the
election of James William Lowther., In
his stead. The Speaker is the incarnation
of the most hoary, traditions of . the : ven
erable mother of Parliamnets. No insig
nificant part of his functions consists in
keeping alive antiquated rules and cus
toms.' .*; ; \' ' ' ; ' ' â¢ ; '
â¢The Speaker's chair Is an Imposing
piece of furniture,; raised-h igh above the
floor of the house,- with a lofty' back and
a canopy over;lt.' But'it is the Speaker's
chair, the glorified "bleached hors^. hair
covering under which he is compelled to
conceal his own. hirsute .top growth* when
presiding over the * : discussions . of "the
lower chamber, j that far more .than his
throne-like seat proclaims the' dignity, so
lemnity and authority ;with'. which he is
Invested. If he appeared without a wlg,
not oven that awe-inspiring, emblem of
authority, the; mace, would suffice to en
sure obedience to; his 'rulings. â¢

on \u25a0\u25a0 the night' of 'July. s>. .Sublime common sense and a certain
taking naivete constitute the larger part
of Kate Condon's charm. Common sense
is anything else than "common" any
where; on the stage it is a jewel of rare
I>-lee. It Is that which makes the man
ager rise up to call a Sembrich blessed.
It is the want cf it that makes the name
of- a Calve the synonym for managerial
torment. It is that which at the Tlvoli
accounts for the almost canonizing 6f a
Collarnarinl and a Warbareschi. And with
these Miss Condon ranks.
I had always admired the poise and
sweet reasonableness of this comely
young woman; her dependableness, her
artistic balance and restraint. Vv i.en,
therefore. I heard that she was to be at
the Tivoli for a good six weeks' season
before she blazes out into big type as the
star of "The Mocking Bird"â l hastened
to a chat with her on the way of it.
There might be too much of Kate Con
don in the coming by and byâ if it were
not for that aforesaid rare common sense.
A sonsie, buxom young woman she Is
now, round of cheek, deep-bosomed, full
ehouldered, built trimly for tights, too,
and with a genius for the boy gait and
bearing. There was something most at
tractively boyish about her altogether, I
thought, as we sat chatting in the cool
of the Tlvoll one hot morning this' week.
Ehe shock hands with one like a boy,
looked at one like a boy, frankly, openly,
directly, and moved about with the quick
freedom and keen delight In movement
of the bey. Withal Miss Condon 'wore the
thinnest and laciest of shirt waists, and
a hat nobly feminine in its beauty and
uselessness.
About the singing teacher we talked
first, intermixed with a little family and
personal history. Five years ago Miss
Condon was a concert einger. She had
not then the slightest Intention of going
a-playlng. There was no family opposi
tion because there was nothing to oppose,
the contingency of a Condon girl going
on the stage not even coming up for con
sideration. Richard Mansfield was the
deus ex machina in the case. He was
.playing In Chicago, laiss Condon's home,
in "The First Violin," in which the hero
ine is supposed to sing. How the august
Richard chose her for the work Miss Con ;
don tells with much enjoyment. It was
at the Manefleld theater, and a stageful
of girls bad gathered to eing.
"We might." Miss Condon laughed,
"have been petitioners at a royal levee
Instead of girls Just wanting work." The
order and decorum and even splendor of
a court prevailed everywhere; and at last
Richard, heralded by whispers of "HE is
coming," entered, between two red
breeched flunkies, and weightily as any
King Richard eat down. He sat as far
as possible from the singers. He heard
EASTERN APPRECIATION OF KEITH
I had heard of Keitbomania long be
fore I knew Mr. Keith or knew his pic
tures. I had heard that Dr. Harry
Tevis was afflicted with it. Will Crocker
and other apparently healthy individ
uals, and I wondered.
But now. after a brief acquaintance
with hi:n and his pictures â his epics in
pigments â L too. have fallen victim.
And, moreover, I know of no cure for It
save the possession of a picture â or
two, or three, as your purse permits,
a.nd your moods vary.
As to Keith himself, he's a most In
teresting personalityâ positive, direct,
masterful, aggressive and tender by
turns, a poet by nature, with a Miltonic
power of imagination, a tremendous
soul, whose bigness one feels In the si
ence of his workshop.
These are the qualities that enable
him to lay upon the dead white canvas
the wonderful sunsets in druidlcal
proves, where the, light glows in a way

â¢ rcat rugged mountains, snow-capped,
*old in their great dfgrnitr. with Â«nÂ«Â«r-
them all with royal indifference until It
came to Miss Condon. Then Mr. Mans
field so far unbent as to send an envoy
to the singer to say that she would do. -
And that would have been Miss Con
don's nearest approach to royaltyâ sha
says â had it not been for the following
pleasant little sequel. The atage manager
preposterously asked her to sing her aria
in a soprano key.
"Couldn't," she said, "wouldn't either."
He couldn't have it transposed, said the
manager. Well, he must get some one
else. Miss Condon replied. The unusual
spectacle of any one else saying things in
his presence struck Mansfield and he
walked over, even as you and I, to see
what was the matter. Quite unabashed
Miss Condon told him. " For reply Mr.
Mansfield disappeared into the wings,
loomed up then at the conductor's desk,
told the cornet, the flute and the rest
what. key to play the aria in, and then
handed the baton to the conductor!
Marescalchl was Miss Condon's teacher,
and her three years with him at the Chi
cago Conservatory was her only teach
ing.
"Common sense, just common sense, Is
what you need in choosing a teacher,"
said the- singer. "Juot at the first It Is
difficult to know, and the singing doc
tors do so disagree! But with any In
telligence you can soon find out If you
are learning to singâ to sing. There
isn't any mystery In it, though that Is
what so many of the teachers make of
it. They keep their pupils In the darkâ
so as to make more work for themselves.
"Why, you know," she said earnestly, "In
a week, a day, an hour even, the whole
principle of singing can be explained. All
the teacher needs do afterward is to in
sist on the principles. . reiterate and re
iterate them; and criticize, eternally
criticize, the interpretation.
â¢â¢You are forced to know how to defend
yourself against the fake teacher," she
went on. "where any plumber can take
a few lessons and then set himself up
in Carnegie Hall as a teacher. There is
possibly more fraud in the teaching of
singing than In any other one profes
sion. And your defense Is Just common
sense, and, of course, musical intelli
gence. Listen to yourself, listen to your
teacher, and see if you and he are at all
getting at the kind of. sound that Caruso
makes, that Sembrich makes, that Schu

"Ah! Schumann-Heink"â from the

â¢Â« makes," solidly . ' finished Miss
Condon.
She was very interesting. In her descrip
tion of a little coaching she has dona with
Isidore Luckstone this year.
"Mental suggestion," she summed up,

Heresy? No, good friend; say not so.
Keith can do bad things, like unto the

does â using his best work as a measure.
But why discuss the unworthy things
when there are' good things to view?

"The chief Idea Is that of poise, perfect
poise.' the poise of the voice, the spiritual
poise, physical poise. They put Itâ it's
rather indefinite, but one feels it," Miss
Condon smiled, "that you must think that
you are floating in the air, that you send
your voice afloat, your thought afloat.
You know how you begin to sing"â Miss
Condon'a grunting "ah!" suggested bot
tomless abyssesâ "the idea is to get that
out of the voice, and get the overtones
into it."
"Ah, the wings," I enlarged. I re
calied then that the very word "afloat"
had often shoved Itself into my conscious
ness along with the Caruso note, the
Sembrich note â as of winged Jewels
liquldly a-shimmer in their soft flight to
the angels that gave 'em.
"Sembrich coaches with Luckstone,'.'
Miss Condon reminded, and added that
Mr. Luckstone, in spite of his extraordi
nary gifts (as critic of interpretation not
as teacher of voice production) is the
fad of the moment in New York.
To get back to Richard Mansfield and
his connection with Kate Condon's fate.
It was on the afternoon when she sang
for the actor that a representative of
Henry Savage heard her. Afterward he
came to her and asked : "Will you go to
St. Louis with Mr. Savage's English
Grand Opera Company and sing the Siebel
in 'Faust* next Tuesday?"
The astonished young woman could only
say: "But I've never, been on the stage.
1 don't. know anything about it, haven't
a single minute's experience."
"Well," said Mr. Savage's representa
tive, "if you're willing to stand for it,
I am!" J
He made then and there an appoint
ment for the girl to meet the impresario.
It was for half-past two the following
day. At half-past three Miss Condon
was due to rehearse with : Mansfield.
Three o'clock found Mr. Savage still a
laggard in his engagement.
"I have to go," Miss Condon declared
at last.
Tho representative I looked much
amused," but said humbly that Mr. Sav
age was. a very busy man. Wouldn't
she wait a little longer? No, she
couldn't. Miss Condon said, and then
Mr. Savage, ;with the usual big, un
lighted cigar in his; mouth and a tre
mendous chrysanthemum in his but
tonhole, walked in.
After a hasty introduction Mr. Savage
said:. "You are going to sing for me?"
"I was," Miss Condon corrected, "but
you are late. I have ; another \u25a0appoint
ment."

Condon laughed, "and â¢ well he might!
There were scores of girls doing every
thing In their power â¢ to get a hearing,
and here was I, ; an unknown little person,
telling him he was late. But he asked
me again to sing Just a note or two, and
I said, 'well, hurry J up,' and did > sing a
little thing' I always sing. After l,t he
wanted me : to stop and talk arrange

after. If I'd tried," Miss Condon de
cided, "I probably could not have done
anything oetter. Mr. Savage saw that
at any rate \ l was going to- do what 1
said I would and 'tend to business."
"Next Tuesday night"! Miss Condon did
sing Siebel cln "Faust," in SL Louis.
"Never was I so rich In my life," she
laughed, "sixty whole dollars a week of
my own!"
But there/ .was the f tribulation of
tightsâ even though It was "only St.
Louis and not Chicago," to go through;
there was the . stage-fright; the fear ot
the other singers; all the nervousness of
appearing In a hastily studied part. But
in spite of all this, singing through her
fears. Miss Condon decided on that first
night that that was ; what , she wanted,
"it's what I've always wanted and never
known I wanted; it's what . I'm going
to do," 'she said to herself, trembling
but triumphant.
The next day she signed a. three-year
contract with \u25a0 Savage, who told her \as
a "starter" that she would be required
to sing Lazarlllo in "Maritana'\ in Chi
cago the following week. "
"Beginning then, and many and many
a time since then," said the singer, "I've
studied until 5 o'clock in the ' morning. I
had to succeed; you know."
. And succeed she did. '
For a' year. Miss Condon stayed with
the Savage Grand \ Opera Company. At

that a profitable engagement was open

"Well, Kate," she says Mr. Savage

like our , three-year contract doesn't
matter, eh? Still I suppose I'll have to

Bosworth Benefit Set
for Friday Next.
Last September an Interviewer In
search of a stage Adonis went to the
California Theater to chat with Hobart
Bosworth. then acting with Miss Flor
ence Roberts in "Tess of the dTJrbcr
vllles." There was every excuse for
her, Mr. Bosworth being an Incredibly
handsome sort of person. He had Just
played an Ellert Lovborg with Mrs.
Fiske's "Hedda Gabler" that in its
sheer masculiue beauty, had paled â¢ at
moments even Mrs. Fiske's morbid scin
tillance. As the Alec d'Urbervllle of
the week he ~ was an- Apollo In top
boots. So the interviewer thought that,
as a professional beauty, Mr. Bosworth
should be Interesting.- The type was
rare, and she thought that here was Its
arch-example. And so she went to see
Hobart Bosworth.
Needless to say to ' any one who
knows that manly and modest gentle
man how far from a matinee beauty
she found him; how she found an-artist.
sincere, earnest, humble; a citizen of
the highest ideals of service; a man,
clean, fine, kind, gentle and brave and
sweetâ in the face of an awful death. "
Before I knew him. in the first fif
teen minutes of our chat, I had asked
the man before me something about
matinee idolatry. I could not think that
he had escaped unscathed; he was a
target too magnificent He had told me
that he had helped along an Impecuni
ous St. Louis art dealer- by permitting 1
him to exhibit some of his pictures, for
Mr. Bosworth, among: other, things, is
a painter of considerable achievement.
He had told mo that he was something 1
of a matinee 'favorite In St. Louis, and
that "the girls bad come up nobly" to
the aid of the dealer. And this is what
he said of himself during 'our chatâ
this all because next Friday afternoon
at th* California .Theater Miss Flor
ence Roberts ?!ves a benefit for Hobart
Bosworth. now dying slowly of con
sumption that he was face to face .with
and quietly lighting when I saw him
last September.
As he said "matinee favorite" my
"Ah" was long aud happy. Here, at last,
was a bit of the Bosworth I had come
out for. Too vaguely for report. I man
aged to suggest the question as to
whether Mr. Bosworth's physical
charms had not something to do with
tho case.
In the following refreshing fashion
he ...coolly argued that it had almost
everything: r"Â«^
"Oh, I know my value 'as a physical
specimen. I've been getting money on
it for years. You â you must not think
that because I played Judas I think
I know Jt allâ nor because of the Lov-*
borg. In New York I played Flavin s
("Alary of Masdala"). and the brutal t
brawn of me dnt srooU service. My Lov- '
borg â did you ever see anything less
like a JLovborg than I am? But Mrs.
Flake wanted a Lovborg of the flesh
pots."
"There's a good deal to be said for
that kind of l.ovborg;" I Inserted.
"But surely Lovborg has more wit
than hcef." Mr. Bosworth protested,
"and I have mor* beef than wit. Bu"Â£ a
good physique is perhaps more useful
to you on the stage than uny where' else.
And I've had one." ;; v ;\V
" "Had* one?" I exclaimed. looking at
the massively shouldered, great- throatedv
long-limbed man before me.
"I used to be consumptive." the actor
surprised me with. "I was down to 139
pounds â Fm 210 now â and there didn't
seem to be any chance for me; in fact.
I've read my own obituary three times
and gone twice to the front door to take
flowers intended for my own I funeral.
You couldn't get much nearer than
that!" '. :-.,-. .
"And how did you â " X stammered.
. "How did I escape?" gossiped Mr.
Bosworfh. "Well. I didn't care particu
larly about the thing, either way. That
eliminated the worry element. Then it -
took plenty, but not too much, fresh air.
And I forced myself to eat enough and
good food, didn't work too hard and
compelled myself to think only healthful
thoughts."
"Something of a Christian science ar
rangement r* -/': ; .:\u25a0*\u25a0'â¢â¢,
"Yes^ â no, though, for I still, have
some little logic left." the actor put. It.
"But you said you had 'bad' health.
It is impossible that now â "
"A few weeks ago."* said the man in
front of me. his clear, quiet blue eyes
calm as a summer lake. "I fell from the
roof of my home in Canadaâ l've a
place there on Rice Lake, Ontarioâ fell
on my shoulder. A severe hemorrhage*
followed, j You can understand what
that means in a one-time consumptive.
Still. I believe it is only some old luns
scars that bled. * But you can under
stand that I am not in quite such good
form ' as usual."
And then I knew my beauty man for
a brave man. Much more casually than
I have told it all this was told. It waÂ»
try the way. aside, hints dropped .her*
and there in the .corners of the inter
view.
To-day Miss Roberts invites you to
help this man, who at last has had to
lay down his arms. First to help oth
ers, say. all the actor folk, was this ona
of them. Next Friday they do their
part. Yours Is simply to go and enjoy

The Smart Set
The President's Danghter
The long-promised visit of Alice, the
President's daughter, Is to-day a thing
of history.
And the memory of that blithe, inde
pendent, saucy little maid, surrounded
by her court of companions, chaperons,
guides, alleged lovers and imposing
parsonages, will long remain with us.
And as for her â she said she would
never forget her stay among us; that
she was fascinated by the big blue bay,
with its eistrald islands; our beau
tiful Golden Gate Park, and the
great ocean that lapped its shores; the
splendid redwoods where good Bohe
mians worship; and Berkeley, wilh its
collages crowning the hills that slope
down to the blue bay. All these things
filled her with delight, and with the im
pulsiveness of youth â and with none of
its UffecUitioiiS^ â Ehe said so again and
again; and in her enthusiasm for the
out-of-doors ehe reflects the tendencies
of her famous father.
But these are all impersonal things,
and neither inflate nor reduce the self
sufficiency of society as Miss Alice saw
it. With a pretty tact and a ready
smile she was a most gracious guest of
honor, manifesting a sincerity of man
ner that might be commended to some
of those who made obeisance to her. If
she was ever bored she cleverly con
cealed it.
As to the attitude of the partyâ men
and women â it was that of gracious
surprise at the hospitality of Callfor
nitns.- and of San Franciscans in par
ticular.
And the truth to tell, San Francisco
society did make a famously good
showing at the Martin reception.
The details of the affair were^ â as at
all Mrs. Martin's affairs â superbly
managed; the women were 'assuredly
stunning; the men big, elegant and cor
rect â with white waistcoats and the
r<*st of the get-up of polite society. And
that, too, without a tip from the hostess.
That Miss Alice will not forget her
visit to the Queen City of the Pacific is a
concession to youth â likewise a boost to
our provincial pride.
But San Francisco looked her pretti
est during the visit of the idol of the
nation, and we might as well 'fess up to
it There are some things that Justify
pride.
The vlEit of Miss Alice and her train
is one.
And by the way, the coming of this
simp;e daughter of the White House to
our hearthstone may leave behind a les
son worth while â that a simple, inter
ested, unaffected manner is the manner
to cultivate, likewise a straightforward
honesty of speech tempered with tact.
The London reason Is on in full cry,
and many San Franciscans are lendlntr
it distinction.
One of the most fascinating women
In the sets that are alive Is Mrs. Mount
c*ay Jephson. formerly stunning Anna
Head, who wedded one of the heroes of
.the late Sir Henry M. Stanley's expedi
tion into darkest Africa â end inci
dentally a most persistent lover.
Their weddluo: was one of the sensa
tions of the San Francisco smart set
a couple of ypars ago. And the second
sensation was caused by a cablegram
in the early part of June telling of a
J.cautiful boy that had come to them.
Vqt the Interesting evÂ«-nt Mrs. Addiaon
Iltadwcnt over to London in the latter
part of April, where Khe will remain
till the end of July.
The Jephsons are occupying a fine
houÂ«se in Calegron Square, which, during
the season Just opened, will be gay with
clever and interesting people.
When Mrs. Head returns to San Fran
cisco -ehe will 'be swamped by the
friends of her charming daughter, eager
for a personal message from their well
beloved friend.
At the recent reception given In
Paris by the American E'mbassador.
Mr. McCormlck, and Mrs. McCormick,
one of the most beautiful and distinguish
ed looking women was Countess Roche
foucauld, formerly MatUe Mitchell,
daughter of Senator Mitchell of Oregon,
now walking 1 In the shadows -of .dis
honor aud possible imprisonment. Deep
sympathy Is felt for fhe beautiful
daughter of the dishonored Western
statesman, whos* greatest crime seems
to be to have been found out; for while
It seems to have been proven that the
aged Senator subverted his legislative
powers to personal grain, there is ample
companionship to such semi-polite
thefts.
However, the blow has fallen heav
ily upon the white-haired statesman,
and yet more heavily upon the daugh
ter who loved him â all of which comes
at a time when she can illy afford to hear
it. for ehe has but lately presented the
Duke an heir to the title of the senior
branch of the Rochefoucauldsâ the
firfet little one that has come to them
In the thirteen years of their wedded
life.
So San Francisco is to be honored by
a visit from the lovely Queen of Italy â
the dowager Queen,- Margherita. Oh,
no; she's not coming to our burg by the
Western sea as an objective point, but
as the gateway from tne Orient, whither
she Is now planning to visit. This sit
ting at the gateway to the Western
world Is the Bplendld destiny of San
Francisco, which is each day gaining
a -social and artistic power, aa well as
commercial.
I wonder who will entertain the
Queen when she comes â perhaps An
drea Sbarboro. Assuredly he would
know how, this elegant gentleman of
the courtly Italian school. Besides. Mr.
Sbarboro Is endowed with a beautiful
daughterâ she who recently wedded
young Musto.
It is regretted that Secretary and Mrs.
Metcalf failed to continue their Journey
West with the Roosevelt-Taft party, since
Sirs. Metcalf would have been a conspicu
ous figure In the entertainment of piquant
Miss Alice. The Metcalfs remained over
In Utica, N. V., to visit relatives, and did
not get back in time for the sailing of
the Manchuria.

The wedding of Dr. Charles Dillon Per
rlne, the astronomer, end Mlsa Belle
Smith, formerly of Berkeley, was quite
an affair in Philadelphia, Independence
day being selected for the unionâ rather a
paradoxical selection, methlnks, for a
marriage. However, the reader of stars
proved himself an adept at reading hearts
as well as stars, and since his meeting
with Miss Smith a year ago on the acad
emic top of Mount Hamilton he has as
siduously wooed her.
It Is thought that Professor Perrlne will
bring his bride West with him after their

Miss Agnes Tobln, whose beautiful lit
tle book, "The Flying Lesson," contains
some exquisite translations of Petrarch,
besides some very tender things of her
own heart and spirit, has set society folk
a-thinking. That a young woman should
toil thusly, without the prod of necessity;
that she should love the sweet quiet of
her study, overlooking her garden, with
the city aud the turquoise bay lying be
yond, eerene and quiet In the . gray dis
tanceâthat she should prefer these jto
their bustling, buzzing "teas," their
dances and their whirl, Is causing a buzz
of wonder.
This serious thinking, however, is not so
rare in the East and in Europe as here in
the West. There's Mrs. Payne Whitney-
Helen Hay that wasâ contributed some
beautiful verse to the world's written
word. So, too, did Mrs. Clarence Mackay
do some serious : work along the lines of
sociology, and. the latest on record is the
booklet of poems by Miss Eleanor Norton,
daughter of Lord Grantland and grand
daughter of Commodore W. H. McVicker
of New York. >
These women of the leisure class who
hold to some serious thought are the bal
ance wheels of society, and to them the
rest of the world owes much, for i their
influence is a leaven , to the idlers of the

of Mrs. Ursula B tone to Lieutenant Daniel
Edward Shean of the Sixteenth Infantry,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY; 9, 1905; â¢"â¢

of last week.

HÂ«ary Drain on the Treasury Forces
the Membership to Call for

Oa Tuesday evening, July 18. Rin

Golden West, will give a benefit enter
tainment at the Majestic Theater, on
which occasion Neil Burgess' play. "The
County Fair." will be produced for the
first time in stock, with all the elab
orateness of scenic display which has
characterized former productions of
this rural comedy. The Industrial
.roubles of 1901 fell heavily upon this
parlor, as a large number of the mem
bers were out of employment and the
parlor very g-enerously remitted the
<lues of all so situated during that
period. This action on the part of the
parlor, while \*ery meritorious and
showing the proper spirit of loyalty
and brotherly love, was nevertheless a
great financial loss, from which it has
never fully recovered. For some time
past the heavy drains upon the funds
of the parlor, caused by the unprece
dented number of oeaths and corre
spondingly large sick list, has further
impaired its finances. It is to replenish
a treasury much depleted from such
causes that this benefit is to be given,
and the 200 or more members of the
parlor are putting forth their best ef
forts to make it a great financial suc
cess.
The following well-known members
of the parlor constitute the committees:
Genera.l committee â Frank Monahan,
chairman; Edward P. Courtney. Philip
C. Muller. John Hannan; John W.
Rogers. Thomas H. Vivian, Virgil L.

of Ah Woon, Chinese Woman,
Pending; Investigation.
Miss Donaldina Cameron of the Pres
byterian Chinese Mission notified Chief
Dinan yesterday morning- that a Chi
nese baby girl, 2 years of age, had
been sold into slavery by its father to
a woman at 23 Spofford alley. Detec
tives Silvey and Coleman brought the
woman, Ah Woon, and the baby to
police headquarters.
When the woman was questioned she
said the child was her own, but later
admitted that its mother was dead and
she had obtained custody of it from
the father. She denied that she had
bought the child as a slave. She and
the child were taken to the City Prison
and placed in charge of the matron.
Miss Cameron laid the case before
Judge Lawlor and he made an order
that the woman and child should be
detained in prison pending a full in
vestigation by the police into the facts
of the case. As soon as a report is
made to the Judge he will take some
action to decide the guardianship of
the child, whose name is Ah Yoke. 4

MAGAZINE ENGLISH.
OFTEX, since the rise cf the magazine and multiplication ot
the Review, the able persons who write the back pages of
those interesting publications have railed loftily at the Lng
lish that is r.sed in the daily press. We do 'not venture a vindica
tion of that daiiy English. " The excuse for it is that in the briet
-lime given to the preparation of a great daily paper the purpose eg
those who write, its text is to make their meaning clear and to con
dense their statements into the least possible space. It is hardly
a matter for wonder that sometimes verbs and nominatives get an
interlocutory decree of divorce, and that adjectives and adverbs
swap jobs, and the subjunctive is treated with cold \u25a0 forgetfulness.
But the net result being that the reader understands what he reaas
*be forgives the lapses in grammar for the sake of the news, hot
'\u25a0off the wire. So, the mother tongue is not badly coated by the
writers of the daily press. Their sins have the merit of being open
and obvious, and others are not led far astray by their example, and
the English speaking races are not injured.
But who can offer an excuse for making slop of the English
.language in a monthly' publication ? Its texts is not prepared under
high pressure and haste. Its proofreaders are not hurried and its
writers have leisure to indulge their taste for that good English,
1 the lack of which in the daily press they habitually deplore. Stand
\u25a0 ing guard over the well of English, they should not defile it them
selves. In one of the .more, pretentious, monthly publications, a
writer who is a producer of books, and in his own peculiar English
would describe himself as "rcputationed," uses several pages in
describing what may be seen from the Flatiron building in New
York. He prepares" the mind of his reader by indulging in phil
' osophy, in praise of the age of which he is an' ornament, as an age
: - of big things and big thoughts, insisting tha} "it is demonstrable
' that small rooms breed small thoughts." Yet John Bunyan's cell
in jail did not ensmall his thoughts, and Goldsmith and Johnson
wrote in garrets thoughts that are still read in four-story houses.
When he at last reaches the Flatiron he tells us that "mean
while on those toppest floors, the eager Sun, aslant, shuttles the
mounting roar." Shuttling a mounting roar may do for an eager
sun in New York, but elsewhere it finds better business than com
pelling a respectable noun to work for a living as a .verb. Then,
common writers who toil on the daily press have always treated
the top as the top, a plain noun, without frills. It lends itself to
the formation of the adjective "topmost," and when this writer
turned top into an adjective and gave it the superlative, he sinned
and .slang-whanged. He would have been less blameworthy if he
had used his dizzy pen and satisfied his longing for the unusual by
writing it topmostest. As between the building's basement and its
topmost floor there are upper floors, why does this fine writer not
give us the "upperest" floors? It would be just as bad English as
his toppest. When he rewrites grammar he will have the adjective
top, as positive top, comparative topper, superlative toppest.
Having reached the toppest floor in the elevator, he looks
around and sees Staten Island, remembering that Commodore Van
derbilt once earned money in "his avocation" of running a row
.boat ferry thence to the city. The Commodore's strong suit was
not grammar, but his idea of his occupation was that it was his
vocation, and he had no time for an avocation. Next our mag
azine of language looks to the west from his high perch to where
"dock liners leviathan as skyscrapers." Do they indeed ! The noun
leviathan is forcibly turned into a verb and set to skyscraping, prob
,ably in defiance of the city ordinance. ,
Of all the language he sells for a- price, however, "toppest" is
the best loved, for he wears it to a frazzle. If put upon his defense
. he would plead the double superlative of Shakespearean English, no
doubt. But his vile invention is not a double superlative; it is a
vacant idiot among words. A rare use of the double superlative
gives a majestic emphasis, as when Shakespeare makes Marc An
tony say, "That was the most unkindest cut of all," and in the
English of the same age St. Paul says, "After the most straitest sect
of our religion I lived a Pharisee." The Apostle to the Gentiles was
handed two, good, sound and seasoned English superlatives, hitched
tandem to pull through his argument before Agrippa. But this
magazine writer would have had Marc Antony say, "That was the
unkindestest cut of all," and St. Paul to hurt His case' before the
Roman by using the word "straitestest."
Toppest and its antonym "bottomest" are not worthy to be
' clothed out of the same alphabet with the genuine and impressive
double superlatives of that English that comes to us in the works of
the Bard of Avon and the King James translation of the Bible
RELATION OF GOVERNMENT TO ART.
r-x RESIDENT ELIOT of Harvard, at the recent dedication of
r^the new Buffalo art gallery, spoke of the ways in which gov
*. -crnment seeks to accomplish its final aim, that is, the happi
ness of the life of the greatest number of people, by. lessening the
preventable evils which go to make life miserable, as being an in
direct process. "The direct way," he says, "to promote that public
happiness which is the ultimate object of democracy is to increase
the number, variety and intensity of those sensations and emotions
which give innocent and frequently recurring pleasure."
Some other notable ideas brought forward by him in his ad
dress are: That training must begin in childhood in order that the
people may appropriate these uplifting art pleasures which are put
before the public; that it is not Â£nough simply, to supply the.ma
terials; that in the schools children should learn through their own
work what are the elements of beauty; that the cultivation of good
taste in beauty is going to be an economic\ factor, for success in
commerce and manufacture will demand its exercise, and that it is
a great mistake to think that the intensifying of the sense of beauty
and the practice of making pretty things in any way enervate the
robuster energies, intellectual foresight and the martial virtues.
He cites as an example of this last mentioned truth the revelation
of the prowess of the Japanese, who though a most remarkably
artistic race, loving their little gardens and groves and delighting
in making pretty things and putting beauty 'into what they manu
facture, yet show an unsurpassed devotion in war and are faithful
in duty unto death. . . ,\ . '/;.:\u25a0
There can be no doubt that this advocacy of democracy's duty
to provide the public with the pleasures that art gives, and also to
train the people from youth up to appreciate the parks and art gal
leries and beautiful public buildings, is wise. Ihe provision will
not only give the direct happinesses, but by training the taste and
calling attention to esthetic pleasures it will draw the inclinations
away from lower amusements that tend to vice and law-breaking,
and from that incentive to greed for wealth which comeS of a social
system that too exclusively holds these pleasures of art in private
control. The commendation is also good that children learn in
school by copying wijh brush and pencil, so they will know^ through
trfcir own work what are the elements of beauty.
FANCIES IN FOOD PRODUCTS.
CONSUMERS' fancies have been made the subject of a study
by the Chief of the Division of Foreign Markets, George K.
Holmes, and in it he shows that the farmer must learn, a
great many,of the whimsical notions of the "markets which talcet his
products. Although the assertion that we "eat with our eyes" is
not by any means new, the facts in proof brought out by, this in
vestigator are surprising as showing the .extent to which sight
influences buyers.
.More than half the market value depends upon good looks in
the average of products and taste: determines only about a quarter
of the demand and value: Among the lessons that the farmer": has
to learn from this disclosure of facts is the odd one that in select- 1

LIFE AS AN ORGANIC WHOLE
Wallace Rice
Charles Darwin was asked once to give his views of a future life. He re
plied at same length, to the effect that he had none, and was disposed to re
gard the whole topic as "beyond the, scope of man's intellect." "But," he add
ed, "man can do his duty."
This seems to me to mean that the person who r has followed the dictates
of his best conscience, has seen his way through the world and has availed
himself of its best opportunities* as far as possible, will find nothing beyoiid
the grave which need cause him a moment's uneasinessâ he has-dbrie his duty.' ;
If he has little, faith in things unseen, it still follows that hennas'? done what j
his hand could find to do without hope of heaven : or fear of â¢ hell; he has
something to hope for and nothing to dread. ; \u25a0
Duty, which the poet has called "stern daughter; of .: the \u25a0voice'" of ; God."_
means '.widely- different things to ditferent men, w'hlchis^to bÂ« expected." But
it also means different things* to -the same man, and it is here that most of j
the world's misery lies. *2P,
A man has as many sets of duties as he has functions to perform. One
duty Is to his own family, of father and mother, brothers and sisters; another
is to his wl/e and children; another to those over him in authority; another. to
those under him as servants or employes; another to his ' country and Its
Government; arfother to his friends; another to strangersj'another to his church;
and the sum of all these is his duty to himself.
It is a curious fact, and one to be deplored, that all of these are not
based upon the same ideas of right and wrong or governed by the same phil-^
osophy of life. .
Men move along the easiest lines, unless continuously provided by, an active .
conscience, and In many casesâ in most, if not allâ there' is et tendency to
shirk Borne one or another- of them.'
Nothing can be done and nothing shirked without its effect upon character.
To evade duties, however unpleasant. Is to soften and enervate one's self,
to dull one's conscience, to make It easier to shirk the -next time, to let
weakness in one thing creep into another department of life: It is a form of
spiritual suicide. . \u25a0
The duty of a man to his oouals JÂ« that due his wife and his brothers and
sisters; to his superiors It Is that due his. parents and his employer: to his In
feriors it Is that. due his children and employes. ..
He cannot be a good. man who falls at these points, no matter how. loud his
professions of goodness. It is oy duty done, \u25a0: not â¢ promised, - that he must live
and die. â¢\u25a0 ;. \u25a0 â¢. . r/fevj" '%:<\u25a0+' - . - * -.-\u25a0\u25a0â¢--'* \u25a0 \u25a0
ing things that the city purchasers will consider, desirable he must
not be guided by what he knows is good. The apple; he. chooses
to eat himself because he knows it is the best in* his orchard is
not the one that will sell the readiest in the cities. The farmer de
cides by the sense of taste, the market takes what attracts the eye.
The exceptions to this rule are usually where the city purchaser was
brought up on a farm and so is influenced by old memories.
In the Louisiana Purchase Exposition the standard for judging
butter gave to flavor only 30 points out of the 100. The Dairy Di
vision of our Bureau of Animal Industry allows flavor only 40
points. Cheese by various associations gets from 45 to . 53 points
for flavor, and in the experiments on cold storage our^ Dairy Division
gave flavor but 25 points, while texture had 50/ By -the Ontario
Fruit Growers' ' Association 85 points are given to features that
please theeye. Lh the matter of berries all the improvements of
cultivation tojplease the markets have resulted in flavors infericr to
the wild varieties of the same fruits. . '..';
One of the most peculiar things of. all is about the price of
meats; a porterhouse steak sells for about 20 cents per. pound be
cause of fancy arid fashion, while out of the same market a piece ot
the heck meat is drily worth 3 cents per pound. This widej'differ
ence is all caused by the name and the appearance of the thing, for
the nutritiousness and taste of the .cheaper part is said ; to be: fully
equal to the costly. Herein may; be one of the most useful hints
in the report ; for it is claimed that this superstition or style about!
the parts of meat is due to the failure of housewives in the past 'i to
prepare the neck pieces with; skill 1 so i,-as to give them a -palatable
appearance. ., That is certainly a good hint for households that have
to practice economy. Â» . '.*, ;
How much the demand because, of looks is due to mere .whim
and custom anid not to any definite law of esthetics is well illus
trated in the case of eggs. Boston wants brown eggs ; New York
and San; Francisco /like \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0; them white; Chicago has no \u25a0choice as to
color at all. The farmer must; of course; study arid iobey;the^de
mands but'the present proportion 1 of j points- that
go to good looks is surely exaggerated and. needs gradual correc
tion. The nutrition of the ; food â¢ and the taste that stimulates th e
appetite are ; surely more necessary '.to give power to work, to Ven joy?

PEN PICTURE
OF THE GIRL
WE ALL KNOW
She' is the girl who says the wrong
thing. to the wrong: parson, at the wrong
time and in the wrong place. She always
drives a round peg into a square hole
and wonders why there are odd vacancies
staring at her from every directions. Fre
quently her friends come to.b.er aid and
fill ud the blank corners with a quality
thfc girl herself cannot command. For
she is ths Tactless Girl, says a writer
in the. PhiladelDhia Inauirer.
â¢ It is 'almost pathetic at times to watch
her - disentangle" herself from one social
knot only to become hopelessly fastened
In another. She Jumps from tha pro
verbial frying pan into the fire and back
again. ; arousing sympathy In the heart 3
of . her friends and joy in those of her
enemies. . \u25a0
It is the Tactless Girl who. when sha
is talking with a man below the average
height, tells him how she, admires a tall.
Herculean physique. She tells the blonde
girl that i the only true beauty, to her
mind, is the brunette type. If she is con
versing with any one whose daughter or
son eloped with the laundress or ran
away with a circus rider, she stumbles
upon 'the subject of romantic marriages,
and wonders why her vis-a-vis seems
bored or uncomfortable. Shs never
notices that she is persisting in an un
welcome topic, but wanders, on. tact*
lessly.
She is permitted to look at a portrait
of her hostessâ a work of art. 'perhaps,
and the pride of the woman whose fea
tures It flatters.
"Oh." exclaimed the Tactless - Girl.
without thinking, "It must have been
copied from ! a photograoh taken several
years ago." Imagine the hostess I
In the same unthinking manner the
tells the man whose wife is his particular
joy. but who runs the gamut of con
spicuous colorings in her gowns, that
the truly woll-dressed woman never
wears brilliant shades, but adheres to
the most conservative tones in her toi
lets Then she J wonders why he scru
tinizes all the women in the room and
compares them with his wife.
The Tactless Girl tells the artist that
she never had much use for the dreamy,
impractical person, and that esthetic
tastes Ho not appeal to her. She likes
the thoroughly business-like man. But
she does not mean to hurt; she simply
forgets.
"When the Tactless Girl gives a din
ner or a party of any sort she selects
her guests without regard for their
congeniality, and. as a consequence,
she is not a success as a hostess. She
is likely to ask two persons who do
not speak to sit next to each other at
the table, and she may ask a man to
escort his ex-flancee home. When she
entertains the Tactless Girl should seek
the advice of a friend or have a mis
tress of ceremonies.
A girl who was known to be entirely
uninteresting and lacking in feminine"
attractiveness was talking with a
Tactless Girl.
"You know," .began the uninteresting
girl, "a person, to be a real social suc
cess, to be quite fascinating, must have
some sort of a mystery about her.
Anything mysterious is so fascinating,
so interesting."
"Then why don't you cultivate a
mystery?" the Tactless Girl blurted out
before she thought. And the blushes
which suffused her cheeks aided and
abetted the little Imp of tactlessness.
The only advice to a Tactless Girl is
to atop and think before she speaks.
She must remember to whom she Is
speaking; if she does not know what
to talk about, let her draw a hint from
their conversation. She must keep her
own views to herself until she finds
out "whether or not they will drop on
any one's toes if she lets them out.
And when she has fallen into a snare
the Tactless Grrl must remember to
drop the strings of conversation which
tangled her up, for she will only be
come more hopelessly Involved.
CATS OF BOSTON
HAVE A SURPRISE
Detective- Charlie Newell of the East
Dedham Street Police Station has solved
the three weeks' mystery of the "Jungle,"
as this South End district has come to be
known, because of the numerous experi
ences the officers have had with crea
tures, such as swarms of bees, boars,
raccoons, opossums and cows, says thÂ»
Boston Herald.
For nearly a month peopls have potrred
Into the station with complaints for Cap
tain O'Lalor. whom they begged to rid the
district of some beast that had disturbed
their : slumbers. Policemen have worked *
dny and night In search for tha prowler,
which uttered shrill screams. Finally tho
cause' of the disturbance was found in an
alley extending between the rear of thÂ»
houses which line Pembroke and "West
Newton streets. People living . there no
ticed that the cats walked along tha
fences, stopped suddenly, screamed and
toppled over as if dead. After, a time
they would recover and limp away, but
never mount this fence again. It t was
finally decided that the screams of these
afflicted cats were the horrible noise*
which had terrified the neighborhood.
Captain O'Lalor next received the com
plaints of those who sympathized ~ with>
the suffering kittles, declaring the ani
mals were being mercilessly tortured.
The other day Detective Newell, digging
about in the alley In the rear of the
houses at - 130 Pembroke and 1-49 'West
Newton streets, discovered a .very fine
and innocent appearing copper wire. He
traced it and found one end was attached
to. an underground conduit and It extend
ed along the top fence rails on either
side of the alley. It was bared to. the
soft "footsies" of the kitties which per
ambulated along the (ence rails and sang
midnight serenades. "When they stepped
on the wire their songs ended with a wild
scream and they fell to the ground as. if
dead. Newell tore up the wire.
It was believed the man who . invented
and rigged this contrivance must be aa
electrician, but the police declare that he
is a musician whose keen ear resented the
midnight screams of the cats.

given the public a new book about the
experiences of his life as a professional
Jtster. He Is the author of "People i

It is tn the spirit of that he makes the

even with the average man, he strives
to equal tho greatest of them in the

the kindly disposition of the little pro

of his boyhood's life is enough to make

It ia about when he and a number of

wife Is talking to him about the great
amount of divorcing that is going on
in the world. Said Crombie:
satirical thing is the question of matri
monial disjunction ever argued. When
the writer wrote it he may have been
under the Inspiration of that aphorism of
Oscar Wilde's that it -is only, the intellect
ually lost who ever argue. But with the
very lightest of touches the book leaves
,uppn the. mind the impression that divorce
in some' cases' Is an excellent thing; and
the possibility of itâ the right to its exer
cise, the only excuse for an Intellectual
>oma&" of -these- modern times to enter
-into matrimonial bonds.
Miss Bellard's inspiration was a very
femlnlnd oneâ using the adjective in the
very restricted sense of infinitely rather
being lovable than logical, with which
q- .lities nature has endowed some wo
men' for man's delight end further ends
of humanity's continuity. By that inspi
ration she patched up a' fractured love
affair and made her lover happy and their
marriage possible. It came to her in the
night and near morning. It was to elect.
In full feminine surrender, to let her lover
.reason it out' why they ought to get mar
ried, since she was so helpless about the
logic of it herself. Of course, he told her
Just any old thing, and trusted to luck
that if the Idea struck her .when she was
in a lovable mood she would not look
very deep into the logic of it. Her aunt,
who, by the by, is a dear old lady, said
it wasn't a reason the man gave her at
all. Her uncle, who in the heart of him
is probably very much like Howells him
self, philosophically smiled upon this solu
tion of 'â¢ the Movers' difficulties In his:
"Well, I suppose she didn't want a rea
eon, if she had an inspiration," and with
that sentence ended the story. .
Lillias Bellard is represented as a
pretty girl of what her uncle Crombie
called the silvery type. She dressed
in frankest sympathy with her own
coloring and so wore argent tones.
She had gray-green eyes. As some
girls make you think of "May or^ July,
so she made you think of September."

prize Ring Furnishes
Theme For London^
Jack London, in his prize fighter story
called "The Game," makes the hero say
that to tell with his own lips the charm
of the squared ring was beyond him. It
has not. been beyond Jack ' London \u25a0to
tell it for him, and perhaps for the whole
pugilistic class in so far as they mingle
aspiration after all the best stimulus
there is in the vocation with the quota
of brutality inevitable to the struggle for
success In it.' It Is well to have the best
side of it so well, presented. \u25a0 : j ' .;
The author chiefly gives us the Game
as It seems to the heart of the young man
who puts his strength . into it. What the

book. That j London > Intensely .loves the

T^The youngePriz* fighter (described, Joe
Fleming of East Oakland, is gifted boun
teously with two elemental passionsâ the
love of woman. and, the love of .fight. The
externals of, hls^ufe.; are jmqÂ«t "gxaphically
and fully, described Â«for: us,-- It^conslsts*
mainly of one "well-fought, and* decisive
combat , in .the squared. ring open to the
public's ' brutal, and. applauding gaze; but
there 'is also "an .; internal . fight ,1 or j this
elementally, strong youthâa squared, cir
cle within., his .own breast ..wherein; two
elemental passions, the love 'of . woman
and the love, of the Game, struggle, to the
death for .mastery. ."',. : .
There are not so many 'paragraphs writ
ten about this last asof the. struggle open
to all eyeSj. but'still.'there are sentences
enough" to show that internal conflict fit
being fought out. Even in the act of
promising the- girl" he loves that for "her
sake he" will quit the ring, the youth feels
an unblddable 1 force*' within which tells :
him the call of the" Game -will \u25a0 always i be
too imperious to be forbidden masterful

happy' love were reigning there," when
comes the knocking at the gate. Far to
ward â¢ the close'of the story the girl in the
case is stunned by-realizing this fact ' â¢â¢
There seems . to be an impression in
some quarters that Jack London's stories
are allegories. This one is good enough
to go without looking too deep for semi
hidden meanings^ 'but whatever allegori- '
cal significance the author may or may ,
not have Incarnated In" this tremendously
combative thing of bone and muscle and
physical courage, why. may not imagina
tion see In the "game" something more
than the fl6t!c struggle for Infamous dol
lars and pugilistic fame and I the admira
tion of the; hyper-elemental woman? Let
"the game" ' signify whatever 'gamble
man's ambition plays, with high, low; or
mediocre motive. The fight- to win In . It
is a" passion whereby, the "civilized man
links himself" as a combative continuation
of the elemental man out of .which he is
evolved. " By the same token I the higher
love for woman links itself to the elemen
tal passion cut of which It came-by, evo
lution. Then the - allegorical study is,
which Is the master passion? Which one.
actually is, in. the elemental .man?; and
which one actually . Is, and which one
ideally ought to be. supreme tn the civil
ized man? Supposing . the dilemma op
portunity were given and. the choice. must
be dared, is the" call: to , "the 1 game" - the

No one who reads Dr. Adler's "The
Religion of Duty" (McClure-Philllps)
will fail to perceive . how much, tha
author's beliefs mean to him and how
earnestly intent he Is on propagating
them. Yet the ethical societies are not
committed to Dr. Adler's religion; and
he himself has always been most so
licitous that they should not be. .Dr.
Adler furnishes the unique example of
a religious teacher profoundly devoted
to - his religious convictions, eager .to
make converts to them and yet Insist
ing that they shall not become the basij
of fellowship In "the church of the un
churched," of which he is the founder.
In the last chapter of his book. Dr.
Adler" indicates -the reason of his posi
tion. He conceives the characteristic
mark of the ethical society to be tha
fact that a ! common crsed Is not J tha
condition, of fellowship, nor the basis
of union. believing that unfettered
liberty la best, and that such liberty is
Incompatible with demanding, assent, as
the condition of membership in an
ethical society, to any philosophical form,
however broad.

of great value in an emergency.
Now, when the buoy is thrown Into

lift it over one's head and shoulders, or
to dive through it; this, however. Is im
possible. The correct thing is to grasp
the two sides of .tho buoy, with fingers
of the hand uppermost, lower yourself
under the buoy and come tip through
the- center, then rest your arms upon
the sides and you will be comfortably,
supported as long as it is '.necessary.
More often than . otherwise, in casa
of accident, a life buoy is not at hand.
In such event, an oar may.be. used .as
a substitute. Now, there is some little
art in saying oneself by this means,

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE."
Future Grain and Provinious.
â¢ CHICAGO, July 8. â Free movement of new
whtat In the Southwest i caused weakness In

AVeaknesa In the wheat market developed
from tfce opening. At the start the market
was ouite tlrm. ScDtember was uo *B@ViC at
i>i>%4fSSVaC. Heavy :aln throughout Kansas
was the main cause of .-.the Initial , firmness.
In the Ncrtiiwest, however, weather conditions
were generally favorable â¢ for.; the spring-sown
crop and thin fact led to free sellinsr â¢by eev
eral prominent commission houees, resulting
in a culclc decline. Later the market became
still weaker, largely in sympathy with a sharp
de-cllne in cash prices, , following reports of
an increased movement of new . wheat in the
Southwest.- There were a number of advices of
a bullish nature, but they seemed to have little
effect en the market. - One -report' from 3an
Francisco claimed that " the whe-at â¢ crop lof
California had deteriorated' 2s per cent. Ftfbm
Minneapolis came another report asserting fhau
black . rust had caused considerable damage to
spring-sown wheat. ..A : factor that broughjff opt
much of the late, selling .was a revised/esti
mate by: a Chicago expert regarding the ratal
winter wheat crop, based on statlsticsyTur
lU&hcd rince July 1. According to these Hgures
the total yield was 400,000.000 to 420.CC0.000
bushels. September.: reached the lowest point
of the day at 87 lÂ»c. The market closed weak:

been arriving freely of late, was offering at
low prices, but found . few buyers. Yellow
Onions ruled firm under a good shipping der

Trade- In miscellaneous vegetables was of the
usual brisk Saturday character, but price*
showed no improvement and the market re
mained weak for most descriptions. The quo
tations for Asparagus are withdrawn, the in
tense heat having practically wound uj> the
crop. The market for Green Corn: was de
moralized, with a heavy accumulation of poor
stock - lying around unsold. Old stock was

Butter, Cheese nnd Eggs.
The feature of the Butter, market continues
to be. the soft and mushy condition of the re
ceipts from all points except Humboldt. : which
Is sending in its product in 'excellent condi
tion considering the intense heat of the past
week. , A ' good many fancy brands of Butter
from near-by points are being sold down to
17*4@18c in order to get rid oftliem. Some
of the consignments are actually leaking
through the package when they arrive here.
Under these circumstances choice hard Butter
rules firm, as already stated.
Cheese continues very weak under excessive
stocks. :

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Local trade In fresh fruits was of the usual
Saturday volume and there was also a brisk
demand for export on the Puget Sound steam
er. Three carloads of Peaches were received
and the market for that article was easier,
but prices of other tree . fruits were main
tained with marked firmness and choice selec
tions, of all varieties cleaned up readily. Figs
were relatively firmer than the other kinds,
receipts being extremely light. There were
large quantities of sunburnt Apricots received
from various sections, and such stock was
slow of sale at irregular prices, but choice
sold off well to the regular trade at $25@3<j
per ton, and the canners paid as high as' $20
for desirable lots. The market was bare of
Cantaloupes and the quotations are omitted.
Watermelons -continued active and, although
supplies were heavy, prices were well main
tained. Berries ruled weak under continued
heavy arrivals and a good portion of the re
ceipts ' showed the \u25a0 effects of the hot weather,
being ' badly ; scorched and otherwise poor.
There was continued firmness In Citrus goods
and stocks of ' Lemons. Limes and good Or
anges were extremely light.

COFFEE â The circular of C. E. Blckford
gives the receipts at this port thus far this
year at 202.077 bags, against 155.365 for the
same time last year. The sales from first
hands were 160.810 bags, against 119.i50. The
stock In first hands July 1 was 76.426 bags.
against 54.452. The world's visible supply
July 1 was 11.263.556 bags, against 12.361.2C5.
The circular says: â¢ .
"July presented very quiet markets, with no
changes in general conditions here or else
where contrary to those noted in our previous
circular of June 3. -
"Buyers still delay pending developments as
to the new Brazilian crops. Just beginning to
come forward, and are further inclined toward
Inaction by summer conditions and the dull
ness always incident to this season. There are
no alterations to be made in former quota
"The world's visible supply again decreased
during June (417.000 bags), making the total
visible July 1 11.2e5.000 bags, lower than any
period since July 1. 1903. when it was prac
tically tho same. The maximum during this
period was 14.350,000 bags on November 1.
1904. showing a reduction of 3.C53.000 bags in
official stocks during the past eight months.
"Receipts at the Brazilian ports during the
next six months will, of course, again ma
terially increase the visible supply, as sta
tistics for a number of years show that over
60 per cent of the entire crop is received from
July 1 to December 31. The present July re
ceipts there are estimated at 1. 200.000. against
1 017.000 actual In July. 1904. Estimates of
the total crop in Brazil. 1003-06. run from
10 SCO COO to 12.000.C00 and of the 'mild' or
outside crops 4.500.CC0 to 5.500,000 bags.
"To-day's first hand stock consists of 10.000
bags Costa Rica. 193S Nicaragua, 43 Honduras.

and 3710 various-, in all. 76.426 bags.

Eredal "Dlrp&tch to The CalL
AUSTIN. Texas, July S.â The placing on
the market of six million acres of land
owned by the State of Texas, which will
be done on September 1 next, will cause
the breaking up of many large cattle
T-arxhes In West Texas, where the land
that is to > sold is situated. At pres
::; and for years past this land has been
under lease by the State to cattlemen.
It was- not until late years that that por
tlon of the State was thought to be
adapted to farming. The agricultural ele
ment kept going farther and farther
\u25a0vest year by year until they began en
croaching upon the domain over which
the cattleman had long held undisputed
Â«way.. Then came the contest for su
branacy and the farmer won. The de
mand for additional land .for homes for
.hese prospective new settlers became so
s-reat that the State resolved to abandon
its policy of leasing six milliAi acres of
Sis public domain and to give the people
â¢iho want homes an opportunity to ob
!n them at small cost. In most ln
r.cÂ«s the cattlemen who have these
.^ls leased for grazing purposes own a
v sections which form a nucleus for
\u25a0 ::eir great ranches. With the abolish
rir.t of the leases these cattlemen will
â¢* unable to continue ranching and they
â¢ iil bÂ» forced to take to stock farming
rpon their reduced holdings or. quit the
-untry. Many of them announce that
I key will adopt the latter course. Some
: . them have purchased or leased large
..inches in Mexico and will move their
herds to their new possessions.
The area of the land which , the State
is -to place upon the market on Septem
er 1 is larger than Massachusetts, New
Hampshire or New Jersey, four times as
.arge as Delaware and twice as large as
Connecticut. The land is to be sold in
lets -of one to eight sections each. .. No
urchaser will be permitted to acquire
:rore than eight sections. It will pro-
Ide homes for about five thousand fam-
S:::ce the announcement was made that
Viis land la to be . placed upon the market
:Jtate Land Commissioner J. J. Terrell
has received letters- from thousands of
people in all parts cf the country mak
:r.g inquiry in regard to the matter. The
fact that the land is to be sold at a mini
mum price of one dollar per acre, with
forty annual payments at interest of only
3 per cent, makes it an attractive proposi
tion to many people who are seeking
homes In the West. A residence of three
years upon the . land is required of each
purchaser to perfect his title to the prop
erty.
The region where this land is situated
has practically none of the features ot
the. frontier as generally pictured by
those who are unfamiliar with the South
west. In point of jsaJubrity of climate It
Is equal if not superior to any part of the
Unjted States. The altitude is from 1200
feet to- SOOO feet. Such a thing as ma
laria *is unknown; There is" not aaiicre
of this land that is not situated con
venient to good schools. Some of It is
distant 50 to 100 miles from the nearest
railroad point, but the roads are good at
all times of the year and distances are
matters of little moment to the settlers.
On some of this land pure, freestone
water is obtainable at depths of 25 to
50 feet.
After disposing of this â¬.000,000 acres the
State of Texas will still own 12,000,000
acres of land which will continue to . be.
leased to cattlemen until such time as the
demand for its settlement shall arrive.

MAMMOTH TREES
EASY TO RAISE
So Declares Horticulturist
Wlio Has Been Experiment
ing s Wi tli Sequoia Gigantea
FEBTEEN YEAES' STUDY
Hopes to Induce the City
of Selma to Cultivate the
(Hants in a New Park;
Special Dispatch to The Call.
S.ELMA, July. S. â Future generations
may enjoy the novelty of visiting a big:
tree' grove in the San Joaquin Villey.
if the plans of Charles Peterson of this
city do not miscarry. Peterson- is an
experimental" horticulturist. Some fif
teen years ago he began experiment
ing with the Sequoia gigantea in this
valley and has now" reached* 1 " a point
where he announces that beyond all
doubt these trees can be raised. As
evidence he shows one tree of this
giant species growing that measures
several feet around and is forty feet
high. It is the finest specimen of the
tree growing in the cultivated state ac
cording to Peterson.
He now proposes that the city, of
Selma plant a park with Sequoia trees,
thereby starting a work that will be a
marvel to future generations. He be
lieves that within 600 years the trees
grown on the deep, rich soil of the val
ley Would rival the largest* of the
giants in the natural parks of - the
mountains where trees have been
growing for ages beyond the knowl
edge of men.
Peterson has a nursery of the giant
trees started and if his plans meet with
favor he will be able to start the great
est novelty in the way of a park ever
proposed by men. He say that within
fifteen years the trees would furnish a
fine shade and points to the tree In his
yard, which in that time? has grown
to a size where the limbs spread over
at least thirty feet of space. In Peter
son's experiments with the Sequoia
trees he has found that after three
years of careful attention the trees
will grow- thriftily without .further
care. ; - -"]
The Selma Chamber of Commerce Is
considering . the matter of a park ,for
Selma and Peterson expects 'to broach
his great plan within a few days in the
hopes that it may be adopted.
It Is comparatively easy to boycott an
Inferior article, but the reputation of
Rainier Beer is so firmly established
that simply calling it "unfair" makes
little difference.

ISLAND AFFAIRS
IN A BAD WAY
Taft Said to ;Ee Urgently
Needed to Straighten Out
j^atters in the Philippines
Special Dispatch ,to The Call.
CALL - BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, July - B.â The ?%immi
nence ol an absolute breakdown' in the
civil government of the Philippines: is'
what is taking Secretary " Taft Â£to ; the
insular possession. Governor Wright
has not, been able to get along, with the
natives in v way that would enable, him
to administer, the affairs of the 'islands
in c satisfactory manner. The Gov
ernoi has lost the Influence which his"
predecessor possessed' over: the natives,
and unless Taft succeeds in restoring:
the old relations the early retirement
of Governor Wright must follow the
tour of inspection. of the Secretary'. ;iV
One of the worst results of \u25a0 the.Gov;
einor's course is : the .. refusal. of ,. the
native property-owners \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0: to : pay ' the
taxes levied by the new rulers of the
country. \u25a0 Before ; the came
there were no such things as land and
international â¢ revenue taxes. ; When they
were Imposed GGoverno r; T at was able
to "Jolly"' the leading natives into pay
ing them, altnough: it; went much
against their grain. . Taf t's way of ; get
ting disagreeable, things done? was to
get an intiuentlal native into 'his-'offlce
and persuade him that by doing as the
Americans 'wanted :him to : , do*, he' was
really, serving: his" own interests best!"
Wright's way . has been-" entirely dif
ferent. Wright's . way has J been ?to 5 point
to the laws made by the legislative body
and 'suggest .to the balky i native Ithal he
could * read,', or. could < hire ; some one wht>
could, and ; ; . that *â¢ his '- business was <to :do
what was commanded, in > the
That way of governing has not been suc
cessful. " : v :
It does . no good \u25a0In the , Philippines .to

French Dramatist in Doubt
as to ;His Latest Work
-Prepared for Coquelin
BIRDStTKE CHAEACTEES
Noyel Opera Evolved From
Music of Ghopin^ Which
Depicts Composer's Life
Special \u25a0 Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
LONDON, i Julyy 8.-^-It seems, after all,
that : it is : not absolutely certain . that
CoQuelin â¢will be able 'to ; produce Ros
tand's new play on his return from South
America : next v fall. Rostand *. himself
thinks it highly probable that tie will find
the\worlc so ' bad ' that he will consign it
to the wastebasketâ or, at. least, pigeon
hole it \u25a0 indefinitely.
The author: of /'Cyrano" long, has been
known as about the most conscientious
of dramatists, but ho has surpassed . hlm-
Belf ; in constructing his latest play. - Thla
Is, of course, the remarkable bird ' drama
"Chanticleer," on which ; ho ! has â¢ been
working , for so long, and which, It = can
be . stated , now, ; was inspired by thÂ© old
French V: fable, "Reynard the Fox." ," At
first Rostand :felt grave doubts \as\u25a0; to
whether a play wherein all thÂ© characters
were birds: or animals could be; made ac
ceptable; : Then, 1 , however, It occurred *. to
him I that "Aristophanes \ had a certain
amount of success with similar material, \u25a0
and reflected " that, iat any rate, ; he \ had
the advantage of the classical Greek
author In the modern stage effects at his
command.,: So he set to work planning
the grouping of his characters and build
ing up his scenes, all with f wonderful
pains and j infinite \ attention ,to details. \
. For many months he ; has given' him 7
self up' entirely to . "Chanticleer," aban
doningrientlrely his ordinary practice of
working on- another, play ; at the same
time. The 'â¢drama is now practically
finished, but the author says he "doesn't
know about it." , He thinks that the
work of imagination/ like a bottle of
wine, should be left; to mature., So he
Is. going to.; put the piece away !n a
drawer / for at least three months, try
ing meanwhile > to . forget all about it,
and hopes ..that at the end of that, time
to scan; it with the critical eye of the
spectator, j; And, as observed -already,
he believes It quite within the bounds
of, probability that he-will then vote
the; thing 1 absurd = and condemn it, in
which case . his admirers will have to
manage for* at least a couple of years
longer without 'a : new work from Ros
tand. \u25a0 . .
HACKETT AFTER PLAYS.
"I am oveV here for business,. not. for a
holiday,", said" James K. Hackett to the
writer -when encountered , at ' the Hotel
Savoy night before last. To begin with.
Hackett .is making arangements for tha
production of Sutro's piece, "The Walls
.of Jericho,"- with which he will open at
the New. York -Savoy on September 28.
Arthur Bourchier played the -piece for
the 250 th time at the Garrick a few
nights ago. , Hackett has also been see
ing two plays- by James Bernard .Fa
gan, "Hawthorne, U. S. A.,%\ and "Under,
Which King," recently prdduced in Lbn^,
don,.: on both of which - % he , has $ options
for 'Americahuse.but it is rather doubt-
fulif he will "decide to produce either,'
as both have proved failures. v :
I The actor.' leaves _, London . almost \ im
mediately and goes '.' to r Paris, i where " ; he
is to 4 : have fan -: interview, with
Wolff, -who, wrote ''The / Secrete of Pol
chirielle," which Hackett ' played in the
United- States last . year. ; Wolff has "a
new ; play r in hand upon which Hackett
has an option. "He expects' to return
to; London and then to sail . f or New,
York. -Incidentally he is ; taking V the
manuscripts of jno | less than t five other
plays which he ; proposes "toT read on
board the steamship.
. CHOPIN ON THE STAGE.
â¢What is an undeniably hover if not a
highly successful -experiment -has Just
been tried in' Parisâ nothingness than
the productions of an: opera entirely,
made "up of Chopin. "; George Sand,, it
may. be , remembered, v predicted â¢ that
Chopin's- music iwouldÂ»be; orchestrated
some day and %, that â¢; it would then be
realized thathis Individuality was more
exquisite - than Sebastian â Bach's and
more | powerful than Beethoven's, g It
is Giacomo ' Oreflce \who, *in collaboration
with a poet, Angelo j Orevito, has : ful
filled; the first part- of Madame Sand's
predictionâ the outcome being, a. work
in-four:acts called "Chopin," in which
the * "Polish â¢ master's -; works are â¢' or
chestrated and : provided with connect
ing links by Oreflce. The result,, how-,
ever, is to show that Chopin: knew more
about â¢ music than 'George Sand did.
The â¢ peculiar delicacy." of \u25a0'\u25a0. the Pole's
compositions withers .to ; nothing under
the > glare \u25a0 of ; the footlights. . . r-10-
But the' libretto "Chopin" : is oven
more extraordinary; than \ its muslcal^set
ting. 'The -composer * himself is .the hero.
As- a-consumptlve,\ hetis,; of course, the
tenor. y In the first act he accounts for.' his
melancholy . state of \u25a0 mind by? the J Op. 15
Nocturne. In : the second, ; he . breaks: in

NEW YORK, July S.â Ten persons were
prostrated and rendered unconscious to
day by h stroke of lightning in Prospect
Park, Brooklyn. The tennis lawn was
crowded with players when a sudden
thunderstorm drove all to shelter. John
Lewis, bis wife" and two children -.aHd
James Haicthwaite and live menibers\6l?
his family found protection" frtom the rain
under a great elm, one of the oldest and
finest trees in the park.
They had scarcely done so when a bolt
struck the tree, spiking the trunk down
to the roots and hurling those beneath
it to the ground,, where they lay motion
less and apparently dead. The spectacle
caused a panic among the hundreds of
people huddled there and under other
trees and regarless of torrents of rain, all
lied toward the nearest exits from the
park. Ambulances were soon on the spot
and the Injured persons were restored to
consciousness. Some of them were found
toÂ» be severely burned and all were suf
fering greatly from the effects of the
shock. Two of the Injured were able. to
go to their home, and the others were
taken to hospitals. All of them are ex
pected to recover.

LONDON, July" S.â European comment
upon the accession of Elihu Root to the
Grst post in the gift of President Roose
velt is uniformly,, congratulatory. '
"The deep regret all the world felt at
the passing of Mr. Hay,!' says the Temps
of Paris, "could not be diminished by
any reflection; but all nations will feel
that his successor Is worthy of the high
traditions associated with the office of
the American Secretary of State."
In the opinion of the London press, Mr.
Ro6sevelt has exceptional need of the
best advisers procurable at. the moment
when his unexampled statecraft in get
ting Russian and Japanese peace negotia
tions under way is likely to prompt other
disputants In Europe, now on tho brink
of war .or marching toward it,', to refer
their differences to Washington's friendly
suggestions. . '
This Delphic utterance, if heard a week
ago. might have been thought to apply
to the Franco-German controversies as
to Slorocco.. But these are. In a fair, way
to settlement, through a "conference" of
the. powers signatory to the Madrid
treaty, all Anglo-French assets in the
Sultanate being withheld from consid
eration.
There, remain the Scandinavian im
broglio, now assuming, unexpected pro
portions, and the grave situation in Aus
tria-Hungary. Advices from Stockholm
and Christlania agree that, if Sweden at
tempt to coerce Norway, she : wlll*-*neet
with a bloody reception, as the Norwe
gians did not declare themselves until
they had -cast an anchor to windward.
They are said to have no fear of a trial
of conclusions with Sweden.
Matters in Hungary are drifting from
bad to worse. , The one ground for hope

Charges That Witnesses for
Prosecution Were Tamper

PORTLAND. July 8. â Sensational
charges that the defense in the case of
the United States against Congressman
Williamson and W. R. Biggs has tam
pered with the witnesses for the prosecu
tion are being made and a direct ques
tion are being made, and a direct ques-
Government if he" had not been told
by the defense that if he testified "right"
was headed off by the timely interference
of Judge Bennett, counsel for the defense.
The objection was sustained by the
court.
Greenberg and ' Henry Heard, employes
of Williamson and Grebell, testified that
they took claims with the assistance and
suggestion of Gesner and with the under
standing that upon final proof the entry
men were to be paid 575 clear for their
right.
A letter was introduced by District At
torney Heney, written by Dr. Van Ges
ner to Henry Heard advising him to re
linquish his timber claim, taken at Ges
ner's suggestion, as Gesner feared a Gov
ernment investigation. This letter said
"the only thing to do is to relinquish
your timber claim. The department has
a tip on the business and I have got to
get out from .under the whole thing." ;
Both witnesses sa*d they were induced
to file on lands adjoining the Gesner
sheep ranch near Princevllle by Gesner
and acted in accordance with the plans
of their employer. The elder -Heard be
came frightened and relinquished his fil
ing, Gesner paying him back: his filing
fee. The son did not'take this advice and
retained his land, making final* proof.
Campbell Duncan; the firsts witness of
the prosecution, testified that he never
completed proof, he having been warned
by Gesner that there was trouble ahead.
After the examination of two witnesses
court was adjourned. until Monday morn^,
Ing, when the motion for a new trial for.
Senator Mitchell will be argued and after
that is -disposed of the Williamson trial
will be resumed. â¢

THE -:SAN< FRANCISCO CALL/ SUNDAY^ JUI^ 9/ 1905:
Remarkable Career of
Chancellor of
\ Germany.
Prince yon Bulow
Is Noted as a
-r Peacemaker.
Special Dloatcb to The Call.
BERLIN, \u25a0 July B.â From plain â¢ Herr
(Mister) to Princo yon ' Bulow in seveti
years is the story of the. rise to rank and
power of Germany's Imperial Chancellor
and Prime Minister, whom Kaiser Wil
helm elevated to the dignity of : prince
hood on the Crown- Prince's wedding
day. \u25a0 ; . .'â¢\u25a0 ;\u25a0 - \u25a0.--*._.
European politics are believed .to con
tain no example of a career so meteoric
and Prince yon Bulow, who is a~ modest
man, is perhaps the most astonished of
all over the skyrocket speed at which his
imperial master has pushed him up the
political ladder. He has attained, as re
ward for services which even his. most
enthusiastic supporters do not brand as
particularly brilliant, the rank wliich
Emperor William the Great, the Kaiser's
grandfather, considered ebod enough to
confer upon Bismarck for the herculean
work of creating the German empire of
to-day.
The commonest remark of the German
"man in the street" is that Prince yon
Bulow is more fortunate than deserving.
He has played Germany's diplomatic
game with considerable astuteness since
he was called to the premiership In 1900,
but his administration has not recorded
any great historical achievement ' for
which his countrymen think the title ot
Prince should have been forthcoming.
What they do admit is that he has made
the biggest kind of a personal ' hit with
the Emperor and wields over him more
influence than anybody In Germany. In
deed, it is doubted if there is any one
else who exercises^ any influence over
William II at aIL >%'\u25a0?!\u25a0
NOTED AS PEACEMAKER.
Prince yon Bulow is euavity itself.
His great forte is compromise. He Is
a peacemaker. "He is eloquent of
tongue and pleasingly mannered. He
is a capital joker and storyteller and
the Kaiser likes nothing so much as a
companion who can amuse him and
keep him in good humor.
When he was Foreign Secretary,
eight or ten years ago, Yon .Bulow con
trived to learn that his impetuous
young master could be "handled", if it
were done adroitly. He set about to
learn just how to approach him and In
what manner he could tie made most
tractable. It is related that he found
a pretext, while Foreign Secretary, to
come Into daily contact with the .Em
peror and improved every opportunity
to penetrate more deeply into the Kai
ser's character and increase the store
of his knowledge.
The Kaiser raised him to the dignity
of a Count in IS9S. after successful ne
gotiations with Spain for the annexa
tion of the Marianne and Caroline Isl
ands in the South Seas, and two years
later made him the successor of his
former chief. Prince yon Hohenloh-J,
Chancellor of the empire. . . \u0084.", ; \u25a0_
Yon Bulow's greatest services to tho
Kaiser have undoubtedly -been . as
peacemaker, and "smoother-over" of
the rough spots caused by the Emper
or's Impulsive speeches, telegrams, and
interfering acts of one kind and an
other. He has not only managed to
calm many, troubled waters in . thl3
way, but has on several notable occa
sions succeeded in deterring his Ma
jesty from repeating "breaks" or com
mitting himself to dangerous oo '.Idea.
HIS DIPLOMATIC CAREER.
,William II .is\u25a0 of a temperament not
easily controlled. , Of brilliant attainments
himself and of exceedingly strong will," he
is not lightly diverted from a set purpose.
Yet It is an open secret In dferman politi
cal and diplomatic circles that Yon Bulow
has mastered the art of swaying the
Kaiser for the Kaiser's own good when
ever circumstances 'demand it. It is re
lated that so , strong has Prince yon
Bulow-felt himself In the Emperor's con
fidence that he has laid It down as a rule
that the Kaiser shall take no important
Initiative without ... his approval. The
Kaiser has , not always lived up to this
alleged understanding, but it Is a matter
of historical record that his outbreaks
of "rashness" are much less common
than they used to be before' Prince yon
Bulow became the mentor of the Imperial
Judgment.
Count yon Bulow is nearly 57 years old.
He is a handsome man and is said to
owe a good deal of his political success
to the fact that he is a ; favorite with
women In the royal and political set.
His diplomatic . career began /after he
left the army In the early seventies. He
was German Minister to Bucharest, Rou
manla; then secretary of the German

embassy at Rome, later Embassador \u25a0\u25a0 at
the Italian court and was then. called to
Berlin' to become * Foreign Secretary.
His career at the i foreign ; office was
market by much industry and success
and in 1900 he became the logical succes
sor to the Chancellorship vacated by the
aged ""Prince yon Hohenlohe. While in
Italy Yon | Bulow made the acquaintance
of i Princess Maria Camporeale.' the I step
daughter of the Italian statesman, Ming
hettl, to whom he was married -in i ISSC.
They have no children. and there is no
one; therefore, as in Bismarck's case, to
inherit the newly created title!
By a dramatic coincidence Yon Bu
low's rank and his already | large for
tune have been increased almost simul
taneously, for on the day before the
Chancellor: was raised to princehood
he became entitled 5 to the sum' of \u25a0 $1,
375,000 left. him under the will of ; his
kinsman, the. late Herr Godefoy.

I to" crush an opponent â¢In the" Reichstag
* with , wit and ' sarcasm. / His . speech in
answer to Joseph Chamberlain's as-.
persions upon the German army in 1901
is- perhaps the ' Prince's' most ; famous
effort. It endeared him" to the people
as nothing he had done before ever did,"
and for : a while there was : the popular
feeling ; that another i; Bismarck Â£-' had
arisen: - Yet I Bulow's friends would not
argue >. that T he is in any respect '- flt to
rank", with ..the- Iron Chancellor.' '\u25a0> Yon
Bulow Is a man of^compromlse and not

WRECKS' A SALOON
Business Turned Over to
Patrons Soon Becomes
Bankrupt.
Epecii.l DUpatch to The Call.
JERSEY CITY, July 8. â When
Saloon Keeper Carlas decided to quit
his place of business at Sussex and
Van Horst streets a few days ago, he
handed the keys to his manager. Hal
eey Knox. and told him to run the busi
ness and get all he could out of it.
Knox assumed responsibility, but busi
ness was not very brisk, so he con
cluded to follow the example of his
former employer and get out. The fol
lowing day he turned the place over to
the men who had supported it in Its
palmy days. .
There was a lively dispute among
â¢the new proprietors as to who should
become bartender. All wanted the job,
but the matter was finally settled by
an agreement that they take turns in
officiating in this capacity.
Things were set to rights and the new
owners at once started In to patronize
the place in the most liberal fashion.
Being part owners, they were not re
quired, of course, to keep the cash reg
ister going, and as a result that very
useful invention became rusty for want
of exercise. After a few days of this
sort of management the saloon. began
to take on a very arid appearance, for
the stock had been exhausted. While
the new owners were looking with sad
faces en the empty bottles and kegs
and wondering how they were going to
continue in business.* their sorrow
was turned to Joy when the truck of
a brewing company drove up to the
door and unloaded three kegs of beer;
The kegs were hustled Inside without
delay, and Joy reigned once more in
the saloon.
But there Is an end to all things, and
â¢0 there came an end to this blissful
condition of affairs at Sussex and Van
Vorst streets. This afternoon -the col
lector for the brewing company called
at the placo and learning the condition
of affairs, hurried to the First Precinct
police station and notified Captain Cody.
He asked the captain to protect the
brewery's property, j Captain Cody se
cured the keys to the saloon, drove out
the co-operative ownership and locked
the doors.

EARL OF LEICESTER NOW
VERY SERIOUSLY ILL
Occupies a Uniqtie
Position Among;
the Nobles.
One of the Oldest
\u25a0of Great Brit-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, July S.â Though he , was
born more than eighty-four years ago,
one of the least of the claims to distinc
tion of the venerable Earl of Leicester
whois now seriously ill, is that he is
numbered among the patriarchs of the
British peerage.. He is in many ways
absolutely; unique among English no
bles. He has been' the father of eight
een children,, of whom fourteen survive,
and he numbers among his sons-in-law
four Earls, a Viscount and' a Baron.
There is a difference in age of close on
a half-century -between his oldest
daughter, Lady Powerscourt, and his
youngest son. He is at once a great
grandfather several times over and the
proud father of a boy of eleven.
The most astonishing thing about the
Earl's family history is the fact that
he married his second wife, the pres
ent Countess, exactly 100 years after
his father married his first. Lord Ron
ald Gower once mentioned the amazing
fact to Queen Victoria, who was pretty
well posted on the family history of. the
peerage, but it so staggered, her that
she 'refused to believe it without docu
mentary proof. ; .; i :
The Earl of Leicester is a notable
example of the good results of' the
simple life â the real simple life, that
is, not that counterfeit of which self
approvingr votaries write to the papers.
When' well on any fine day he might
be encountered on one of the fields of
his estate, clad in a suit of rough
tweed, with gun on shoulder. A true
sportsman, he believes in the sport that
gives the game a chance â -not" that
form of slaughter so popular among
the British aristocracy in which an
army of beaters drive the birds on the
guns. .
At lunch time he -may be looked for
under r a hedge, munching bread and
cheese and onions, and washing it down
with a draught of beer brewed In his
own house. â¢ -That menu is not altered
even for the Prince of Wales when he
goes shooting with the Earl of Leicester.
He will not deviate from his simple habits
or put on style to please anybody.
Holkham Hall, where the veteran peer
has spent most of his time in recent
years, is a vast Palladian edifice of white
stone, standing in a park as flat as a
pancake but diversified with some flne
timber. He occupies the ground floor of
his magnificent mansion, . and there are
certain rules of the establishment to
.which every one (royal visitors not ex
cepted) has to conform. Air under his
roof are expected to be in bed by 11
o'clock, and 'bridge and- kindred diver
sion!* are forbidden. \u25a0 - -
The Earl is a good landlord, an enthu
siastic naturalist and a. genuine philan
thropist with a penchant for church re
storation, the cost of which he defrays
out of his own pocket. . In his own
county, Norfolk, there are several which
owe their preservation to him.

taining-corrosive sublimate was found
in the room, but' Hull's friends place no
credence* in -a theory of suicide. Dr.
Montgomery said he 'had prescribed
corrosive sublimate as a lotion 1 for an

LONDON. July B.â When the Duke of
Manchester married Miss Zimmerman it
was generally assumed that he was an
impecunious peer 'and that he married
her 'solely for her money. But.it now
appears that the Cincinnati girl, besides
gaining' a tide by the marriage did not
not by- any. means do such a bad thing
for herself financially. ".
The Duke is now completing negotia
tions for the sale to his tenants, under
the Irish land purchase act. of bis
estates at Tanderagee. Commissioners
have just appraised, the property at
$1,150,000. No -one knows Just how
much cash Papa Zimmerman settled on
his daughter, but it is doubtful if it
exceeded that sum. Husbands with
over a million dollars are not to be
picked up every day. even In the land
where millionaires most abound.
- If after selling his property the Duke
settles down to the railway business in
America. \u25a0- under his father-in-law's
guidance, it will show that he isreally
possessed of a genuine desire for work
and is not content to go through life
as a. titled, idler. Meanwhile, however,
he and the Duchess are enjoying life at
Kylemore Castle, their _ magnificent
home in Connemara, which is Quite fit
to house a King, though King Edward
seemed to prefer being a guest else

During an lllnes* with which I have Â«ur-.

nearly eight years I have treated with
prominent physicians In Los Angeles, San

er even 6i&rno*e my eaae. 11 â¢* condition
gradually became worse, until I was pro-
nounced lscsrable by them. I was In a

decided as a last resort to try Chinese
treatment and consulted with Dr. Wong

sty case by the simple feellr.r of .the

CREW OF THE KNIAZ
POTEMKINE YIELDS
Mutineers Surrender to the Gov
ernment of Roumania.
Russia Will Demand That They Be
Given Up for Punishment.
LONDON, July B.â A dispatch to a news agency from
St. Petersburg says that a serious outbreak on the part
of the men of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth naval bat
talions occurred to-day near St. Petersburg. The rioters
broke all the windows, and their officers were compelled
to summon troops from the various military posts. :
ST. PETERSBURG, July B.â The Ad
miralty late this afternoon was In
formed of the surrender of the Kniaz
Potexnklne to the Roumanian authori
ties at Kustenji, but the officials here
have no details of the arrangements
made between the Roumanian Govern
ment and the mutineers. No diplomatic
steps have been taken, but the Foreign
Office undoubtedly will make the
strongest representations against the
mutineers being treated as simple de
serters and will demand their sur
render, to answer not only for mutiny,
but also for the murder, of their of
ficers, the bombardment of Odessa and
Incitement to revolution. The vain
glorious proclamation Issued by the
mutineers at Odessa also will weigh
heavily against them. Their crime is
one which is considered to be the most
odious by all nations, and It is believed
to be imperative that the strongest
punishment be meted out to the ring
leaders as an example to the fleets of
Russia and of the whole world.
Rear Admiral Kruger's sauadron, as
soon as It can be reached, will be or
dered to continue to Kustenji, take over
the battleship and place a crew on
board.
There Is a strong sentiment in favor
of wiping the name of the Kniaz
Potemkine from the navy register and
giving the ship a new name.
The situation In the Caucasus is so
bad that the authorities there dare not
publish an official account of .the naval
nutinies or â¢ the events at Odessa.
There are continual disorders at Tiflis.
and the Government is taking: measures
to distribute arms and ammunition
among the Russian population of the
Caucasus.
At Kleft a non-commissioned officer
has been tried by court-martial and
sent to prison for dissemination of
revolutionary literature among: the sol
diers.
Serious anti-Semitic riots have oc
curred in the district around Nishni
Novgorod. The educated classes also
have been attacked.
The -police of Markarieff are power
less to stop the excesses there. The
town was grlven over to the mob for
several hours.
The publication of the Emperor's re
ply to the reactionary deputation, in
which his Majesty addressed the dele
gates as "gentlemen and brothers," has
created a favorable impression, even
among the Liberals, as it is noticed
that the Emperor reiterated his promise
to summon an assembly without dis
cussing the deputation's suggestion
looking to a more restricted body than
outlined In the Boullgan project, and
also that his Majesty failed to com
ment on their advocacy of a continu
ance of the war.

KUSTEXJI, Roumania. July 8. â The
flag of St. Andrew once again floats
over the battleship Knlaz Potemkine
and the torpedo-boat which have
proved such terrors to the Black Sea
communities for a couple of weeks
past. The formal surrender of the mu
tinous crews actually occurred .at 1
o'clock this afternoon after a series of
negotiations between the Roumanian
authorities and the leaders of the mu
tineers. â¢ ;.-.. .
The Roumanian officers who board
ed the battleship on her, arrival here
called upon the crew to surrender. In
which case they would be treated Â«is
foreign deserters, or else leave the
port forthwith. It speedily became
known that the Russians came to this
port with the Intention of giving them
selves up to a foreign Government, and
they soon announced themselves as

The mutineers wanted to takei off
the treasure which was on board the
Kniaz Potemklne. but the authorities
declined to acauiesce.
The Russians will gradually be con
veyed to any frontier they may select
and will then be liberated, the local of
ficials having given an understanding
to this effect. The j Ãoumanian flag has
been hoisted over the Russian war
ships, as well as the Russian flag, so
as to prevent, any attack upon them
in Roumanian waters by the vessels of
the Russian squadron, which are re
ported to be in pursuit of the muti
neers.
The mutineers offered to present the
battleship to" the Roumanian Govern
ment, as they declared they were
anxious that she should not be handed
over to Russia.
GRIM REQUEST TO TURKEY.
Russia llnd Asked That the Battleship

CONSTANTINOPLE, July 8. â The
Russian embassy authorized Turkey to
sink the Russian . battleship Knlaz
Potemkine if she appears at the en
trance of the Bo&phorus. The Porte
called the attention of the embassy to
the possibility of the battleship at
tempting to force a passage of the
Bosphorus and asked what ought to be
done under such circumstances.
"Sink her without hesitation," was
the reply.
The dispatch boat Izzedin consequent
ly was sent to try to communicate with
the Kniaz Potemkine and warn her not
to go to Anadoli-Kavak, at the en
trance of the Bosphorus, as she would
be sunk if she appeared.

ARE SHOWN TO
DEAD PRINCE
Eiwial l-st-- au-ii a. llie Call.
BERLIN. July 6.â Prince Leopold of
Hohenzollern. because of whom the
Franco-Prussian war was fought, diod
the other day at the age of sixty-nine.
Prince Leopold was buried with impos
ing military honors, the Kaiser at the
head of 10.W0 picked troops of the Berlin
garrison lending martial splendor to the
Â«>bsequies of the personage so intimately
associated with the great struggle of
IS7O-7L
It was the selection of this Hohenzol
lern prince by the Spanish Cortes to fill
the vacant throne at Madrid that pro
voked Emperor Napoleon HI to protest
and make such representations to Ger
many that war became inevitable. But
although this incident precipitated the
conflict, it Is a fact that Bismarck had
craftily adjusted European politics so as
to make the struggle between Prussia
and the allied German states with the
last French empire practically certain ln
any event.
Prince Leopold was taken ill suddenly
at the palace of his son, while attending
the Crown Prince's wedding festivities.
, and died of heart failure the same day.
He was the head of the older but^not
reigning branch of the house of Hohen
zollern. Politically the Prince was prom
inent only when the Spanish Parliament
made him an international character .In
JK7O. He was married to the Infanta An
tonia of Portugal, aunt of the reigning
King Don Carlos, in 1861. Through re
lationship on his mother's side with the
court* of Germany and France, the Span
, ish Cortes thought him an ideal candi
date for their throne.
When the French under Napoleon 111
began to show signs of disapproval.
Prince Leopold placed the matter In the
hands of Kingr William I of Prussia for
decision, who telegraphed the Madrid
legislators a positive refusal as soon
as the Paris Government Intimated
that they would make the Hohenzollern
candidature a "casus belli" against
united Germany.
Prince Leopold took active part In
the war which he thus brought about
end served with the Crown Prince, later
Emperor Frederick lIL He was popu
larly known in the army as "Das Kar
nJckel" (the rabbit), a German collo^
quiaiism denoting any one who "starts
thlng-s." The Prince at the time of his
death held the rank of lieutenant gen
eral In the German army. He was a
brother of King Chartes of Roumanla.
lie is also survived by three sons, one.
of whom is Crown Prince of Roumania
fJClng: Charles being childless), and an
other, Prince Karl Anton, who is re
turning: from Manchuria, where he was
German military attache with the Jap
anese army.
Particular interest attaches at the
present moment to the career of Prince
Leopold, as another Hohenzollern
Prince Eitel Friedrich, second son of
Kaiser Wllhelm, is a supposed candl

WOMAN WREAKS
TRAGIC REVENGE
Performer in Circus Trains
Two Panthers to Kill Man
Who Blighted Her Life
SHE ALSO MEETS DEATH
Kepenting Her Mad Act. She
Tries to Save Victim Aiiid
Animals Tear Her to Pieces
Special Disratch lo The C&!l,
ALVDRID. July B.â The revenge a boauti-'
f ul woman wreaked u:>on her bctrayer-j
a revenge which ultimately ended In her
death as well as in hisâ has filled all
Spain with horror, so grewsome, weird
and unusuai was it. In ils conception
and execution the tragedy stands un-'
paralleled.
There arrived in Seville a few days ago
a traveling circus, in which was employed
a young: lion tamer, Dona Pellcia," a'
Woman of rare' beauty and great
courage. She was mistress of a. cage of
panthers of extraordinary ferocity, and
her act attracted endless attention. One
night there appeared among ths specta
tors a young man named Don Juan d'Al
meira, who, while watching the girl's
daring feat, recognized in her a sweet
heart of long ago. He had abandoned her
at a time when she most iieedeil him,
but now he wa3 again drawn to her by
memories of the past, and after the per
formance he called upon her in her dress-
Ing room.
In an instant Dona Felicia recognized
In her visitor tha man who had brought
\u25a0sorrow into her life, and a great and
overwhelming longing for revenge seized
her. To accomplish a 'tragic scheme that
flashed across her tnlnd she held | her,
emotions In check and, instead of repell
ing bcr old-time lovar. she urged him. to.
return a few days later.
- lie had hardly left her before she skill
fully dressed a dummy to resemble him.
and then, with infinite pain*, trained and
coaxed two ferocious panthers to spring
upon the figure. When the beasts had
leariied their lesson well she petted them
and waited. On the day appointed Don
Juan entered her dressing room. He had
just seated himself upon the sofa when
Dona. Felicia suddenly threw open a door
communicating with the i panthers' ,cage.
anJ Into the room the great blood-thirsty
beasts bounded. \u0084/.c
They were upon the man before â¢he
could rise, and in another moment were
tearing him limb from limb. So horrible
was the sight that the woman repented
her act and sprang between the panthers
nnd her old suitor. She commanded them
to cease, whipped them and called for
help. But the infuriated animals had
tasted blood, and, turning from the dying
Don Juan, they struck her down and tore
h*>r to pieces also.

DEVLIN MINERS
GET THEIR PAY
Receiver Leland Advances
Siun of $50,000 to Meet
the Collieries' Salary Roll
MORE FUNDS IN SIGHT
Financiers Confident That
the Kansas Banker Will
Meet All His Obligations
TOPEKA, Kans.. July B.â The Devlin
miners In Southern Kansas were paid this
evening -with $50,000 borrowed from. Cyrus
Leland, one of the receiver* of the Dev
lin estate. Money will be sent to Osage
City next week to meet the pay roll
there. This will be advanced by the
Santa Fe Railroad. Treasurer Edward
Wilder announced that the Santa Fe was
ready to advance the 150,000 for the South
ern TCar"""* miners, but Leland had al
ready made arrangements to secure It.
The Santa Fe wants to keep all the Dev
lin mines open, as the road Is depending
upon them for Its coal supply.
.George R. Pock of Chicago is here to
see Devlin. He expressed the utmost
confidence that Devlin could pay. He
said:
'â¢*- the Devlin properties are managed
right there is not a particle of question in
my mind that they will pay out twice
as much as the debts now aggregate.
Take all his Immense coal lands, his fine
farming properties, his real estate and
other things. Look at their value. Mr.
Dsvlln was a very rich man. He was a
remarkable business man. one of the
greatest in the West. Pay out? Why
of course he will pay out. All that is
needed now Is managementâ good, sane,
business management. f%
"I wish you would mention particularly
that I know it to be a positive fact that
Mr. Devlin's assets will almost twice
cover his debts."
MIIS. ADAIR DISAPPOINTED
BY PRUVCESS MARGARET
Expected to Entertain Her on the
Honeymoon, but Bride Alter*
Her Plan*.
LONDON. July B.â Among American
society women in England there is not
at the moment one more disappointed
than Mrs. Adalr. She had made up her
mind that the honeymoon of Prince
Gustavus of Sweden and Princess Mar
garet of Connaught would be spent at
her beautiful place in Ireland and their
altered plans have caused her great
chagrin.
In anticipation of the visit of the
newly married couple to Glenveigh Cas
tle, In the Irish highlands, Mrs. Adair
had gone to great expense in the way
of furnishing and decoration. She
studied the tastes of Princess Margaret
in this connection and she must have
spent some thousands of dollars on the
special suite of rooms which were tc be
placed at her disposal. Continental
china shops were ransacked for orna
ments, tapestry of unique design was
brought from Paris, while one of the
leading? furnishing houses In London
had instructions to put In the best it
had in stock.
The rooms at the castle commenced to
be known among the household staff as
Princess Margaret's rooms. What is
surprising people most is that the Prin
cess did not insist on going to Glen
veigh, considering the many evidences
she has given of her great fondness for
Mrs. Adair.
HARP RETURNS TO FAVOR
IN ENGLISH SOCIETY
Hi* Revival Follows the Vogue for the
Elbovr Sleeves and Brace
lets.
LONDON, July 8. â A revival of -ha
harp as the favorite "society instru
ment" is impending and many women
whose ambition it is to be always up
to date In the matter of fads are this
season taking lessons.
It is something more than a coin
cidence that the return to popularity
of the instrument in which our grand
mothers delighted follows the vogue
for the elbow sleeves and bracelets
that characterized early Victorian ?i
tire. In those old days books devoted
to feminine accomplishments invari
ably included the recommendation that
"the woman, who has good arms
should learn to play the harp." When
long tight sleeves came Into fashion,
hiding: feminine * arms, shapely and
otherwise, harp-playing went out of
fashion. And now that short sleeves
again admit of the free display of
shapely arms harp-playing has been
taken up as the best method of calling
attention to their beauty.
But unfortunately pretty arms do
not by any means always Indicate mu
sical talent. And meanwhile the harp
In the hands of misguided devotees of
fashion who | persist in practicing for
several hours daily adds fresh terrors
to town life.

LAWSON SCORES
THE JUDICIARY
Says That the Great Cor
porations Pay the Judges
for Favorable Decisions
PEOPLE BEING ROBBED
Declares That Rogers Used
Five Million Dollars to
Secure Defeat of Bryan
OTTAWA, Kans., July B.â Thomas , W.
Lawson of Boston adrdessed a great
crowd at the Chauteauq.ua assembly here
this afternoon. He spoke of "The ' Sy
stem." Lawson arrived at \u25a0 noon - from
Kansas City, where he and William T.
Jerome, District Attorney of New T.York
City, were the guests of honor last night
at the monthly dinner of the Knife and
Fork Club.
Lawson said in part:
"I have come to Kansas on a staple
missionâ to point out to you that the
American people are being robbed, by
whom, how and what the consequences
will be if the robbery is not stayed and
an example made : of the robbers."
Lawson discussed at length the evils of
the "System," and continued: ; :
"What are you going to do about "it?
You know that the economic condition
which allows the few ' to possess all , and
the many are left with nothing must be
ended. If it is not, slavery is.- the. alter
native. How shall it be ended? By your
ballots? What are ballots against dol
lars, and the 'system' has unlimited dol
lars. With $5,000,000 I saw Rogers rob
the able, fearless, honest but all wrong
on the money question William Jennings
Bryan out of the Presidency of the Uni
ted States in 1596. Do you Imagine he
would shrink from repeating the opera
tion in 190S if he feared that the man you
nominated would upset his control?
"To-day at the helm of your affairs is
an able and fearless American, , bold \u25a0 to
conceive and strong to execute.. To all
of you he is a hero, and you are behind
him, ready to back up his course wher
ever he sees fit to go. President Roose
velt knows it, and to-day no man in the
country is more keenly aware of the ne
cessity of curbing the corporate despot
ism under which we liveâ but what can
President Roosevelt do?
"I hate to say it, but he is as help
less in the system's' net as a bull in a
balloon. Like Gulliver in Liliputia, he is
bound by- a thousand threadsâ Congress,
the Senate, the party's Interests, and
gratitude, and all the intangible influ
ences which the great money power can
weave around any individual. How brave
and quick the President is to do! â¢ /
"A wrong is called to his attention, a
law must needs be passedâ the rebate evil
must be curbed, and he sends messages
to Congress demanding instant action.
What' happens? Congress temporises; the
Senate snubs him, and the 'system'
snickers."
Relief was not to be looked for from
the courts, Lawson said, because .the
great corporations "do not hesitate to
suborn perjury, bribe juries and pay
Judges for favorable decisions."
Stunfcipal' ownership ' liawson dismissed
as a will-o'â the-wlsp, and ' he. added:
"The surest, safest and most natural
process of restitution is the application
of the 'system's* own methods ,to the
'system.' The first step is for the Amer
ican people to divorce - themselves from
the 'system' and sell every share of stock
and every : bond they hold back to the
frenzied financiers at present inflated
prices. Take the money thus realized and
place it in banks and trust companies, or,
better still, in Government, State and
municipal bonds."
This, Lawson said, -would cause a col
lapse of the "system" which would be
obliged to throw over the stocks and
bonds it carried. These stocks and- bonds
the people could purchase, and, having
only to pay interest on their real values,
could reduce rates of fare and freight and
prices generally, and the revolution would
then be complete. . -

FAKERS AT FAIR
LOSING MONEY
Concessionaires on the
''Trail;' Want Permission
to Keep Open on Sunday
WILL APPEAL TO LAW
Say They Will Show Their
Freaks on Sabbath. Even if
a Permit Is Denied Them
PORTLAND. -July B.â lf the threats of
the concessionaires doing business on thÂ«?
"Trail" at the Lewis and Clark Exposi
tion to open their doors to-morrow are
ke;-t there promises to be a lively war be
tween the management of the exposition
and the coneessiona'res. The trail people
have had an unprofitable season since the
opening of the exposition and bankruptcy
threatens some of them unless some ac
tion is taken by the exposition manage
ment to ameliorate conditions.
When the opening of the exposition to
the public on Sundays was first broached
by the fair corporation the ministerial
body of this city entered vigorous .pro
test and it was only on the promise of
President Goode that the "Trail" would
not be permitted to operate that the pro
test of the ministers was withdrawn.
With the freak street doing little busi
ness six days in the week and many of
the attractions operating at great finan
cial loss the concessionaires' association
in secret meeting decided to force the
matter and announced that unless the
embargo on Sunday closing was with
drawn the "Trail" would be closed per
manently.
President Goode to-day made the posi
tive announcement ;- that the "Trail"
would not be permitted to open to-mor
row. The concessionaires say positively
that it will open and an Injunction will
be sought in the courts to force the ex
position management to refrain from ac
tion adverse to their interests.
KNOT NOT NECESSARY
TO THEIR HAPPINESS
Oregon People After Fifteen
Years Learn They Were
Never Married
PORTLAND, July B.â Adam Knoble and
Mary Anna Magdalena Meier were mar
ried about fifteen years ago under the old
contract law in California. They are now
about 40 years old and have lived happily
together since their marriage. Though ig
norant of the law, the wife lately began
to suspect they were not legally married
under the Oregon laws and suggested to
her husband that they get a license here.
Together they went to County Clerk
Fields, where they finally secured a li
cense.
When they arrived at home they discov
ered that that part of the license certify
ing to the solemnizing of the marriage
was blank and a hurried trip wag marie
back to the clerk, who explained to the
singularly ignorant couple that the ser
vices of a minister or other Qualified per
son was necessary.

MEXICO WITHDRAWS DUTY
- ON SHIPMENTS OF WHEAT
Railroad* Also Help Intending Export -
era bjr Reducing the Freight
, Rates to El Paso.
The announcement of the Mexican
Government that the duty on wheat
wiir not be levied until the end of
August - will ; have but little effect on
the local market, as the present crop
is so light that there will be little for
exportation after home demands have
been satisfied. Like reports are being:
received from Washington and Oregon,
although the - railroads are helping
shippers by lowering the rate to El
Paso to 30 cents per 100 pounds.
; The lowering 1 the rate,' which was
formerly 43 cents per 100 ! pounds, will
have the, effect of meeting tha shipping
rate, from 1 Kansas and Missouri ship
ping points to the Mexican border. It
Is : hoped by the railroads that the low
rate will induce "liberal shipments, but
the i small crops . may "< prove a bar to
farmers offering wheat for transporta
tion to Mexico. \u0084

"Ayra" Hall Seeks the Ar

for Threats Against Life
WARRANT IS REFUSED
â¢ Partners in a Chicken Ranch
â¢ Practice Mental Telepathy
as Side Issue and Quarrel
OAKLAND, July S.â Mrs. M. E. Hall,
medium and mindreader. does not In
tend to allow A. Normand. her erst
while pupil and partner in the chicken
raising Industry at Allendale, to escape
punishment because she failed to
prcseecute him for disturbing the
peace. She now wants him Imprisoned
for alleged threats against her life
made during their trouble last Decem
ber. With this idea In view she called
upon Justice of the Peace Geary to
day and filed three affidavits to the ef
fect that Normand had made the
threats. They were those of herself,
Minnie Wolfe and Raymond Wolfe,
neighbors in Allendale.
The couple met in San Francisco at
a spiritualist meeting and she pro
ceeded to instruct him in mental tele
pathy. He was an apt pupil and soon
they decided t6 raise chickens at Al
lendale. A ranch was purchased and
Mrs. Hall went to live in a house on
the place, while Norniand occupied a
tent In the yard. After the day's work
was over they would practice tele
pathy and exchanged letters to tell
each other the impressions they had
received.
It was her letters that were read in
court when Normand -was being tried
for disturbing the peace, and caused
Mrs. Hall to drop tno prosecution.
They were signed "Ayra" and addressed
to "Candor" and contained endearing
words. When they were read Mrs. Hall
promptly \u25a0went into hysterics and the
court was adjourned. It is said that
trouble over the chickens disrupted the
partnership.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL/SUNDAY,, JULY 9, 1905.
BERKELEY GIRL WHO LOBT $2000
.WORTH OF JEWELRY. IN MYS
TERIOUS MANNER.
BERKELEY. July B.â A peculiar case
concerning the loss, probably through
robbery, of $2COO worth of jewels, was re
ported to the police authorities of Ber
keley to-day by Henry Rowe, a wealthy
contractor whose residence is on Univer
sity Terrace, in the -fashionable part of
the town. His daughter was the victim.
So mysterious have been the movements
of both the officers and Mr. Rowe that
the case has-\aroused greater, interest
than that inspired by the ordinary dia
mond robbery.
Miss Geraldine Rowe, a beautiful so
ciety girl, daughter of Contractor Rowe,
appears in one of the reports regarding
the robbery as the victim of thieves, and
in another as having accidentally lost
about $2000 worth of valuable gems which
she wore. The reluctance of the police,
and Mr. Rowe's conflicting statements,
make it apparently impossible to deter
mine whether Miss Geraldine lost her dia
monds while traveling from Berkeley to
Belvedere, or whether she was a victim
of the light-fingered gentry, or criminals
even more desperate, who used measures
that have not been revealed by 'the: po
lice to secure the valuable stones she
carried. , - /
JEWELRY "WORTH $2000.
Mr. Rowe visited Marshal Vollmer's ' of
fice this morning and reported, the loss of
the jewelry. Its value was estimated at
about $2000. At once the report spread
that the Rowe mansion on University
Terrace had been entered by thieves while
the family was absent attending the'-re
ception to Secretary Taft yesterday af
ternoon, on the University campus. The
marshal's office would neither confirm nor
deny this report, and it was accepted as
correct. Mr. Rowe would; say nothing,
until late in the day, when he reluctantly
admitted that a lot of jewelry, had been
lost * by his daughter Geraldine. He
begged to be excused from further discus
sion of the matter. \ ;
Rowe admitted his \u25a0 daughter had been
bo thoughtless as to wear an unusual
amount of jewelry,' including a diamond
necklace and several handsome " rings,
while making a Journey from Berkeley
to Belvedere: â¢' In ' a â¢ facetious '- vein,' Mr.
Rowe then insisted, that snakes that- are
numerous in the ' locality probably had
taken the gems from the house,: and that
they had since been returned.. Finally
the contractor said: "See me next, Tue
sday and I can then tell ' yo# jj something
that may clear up the mystery - in ' the
case." i .' : "'"\u25a0':'-,
SCOFFS FAINTING THEORY.
Mr. Rowe scoffed at the suggestion that
Miss * Rowe might . have fainted, during
the extreme heat yesterday,- and then
been the victim of .thieves at some
po^int on her journey. Ho refused to dis
cuss any theories concerning the method
by which the Jewels were taken from 1 his
daughter, or by which; they , may have
been lost. Neither, would be "explain the
unusual circumstance ; of . a i young woman
wearing so much Jewelry on an across

Miss Rowe is now in : Larkspur, accord

QUEEN OF ENGLAND
AN ANOMALOUS POSITION
"For Prlvnte Business Purposes* Sbe
. Is Not Recorded as Â»3lu
- . rled Woman
Great Interest was aroused recently
by the" circumstances that in a grave
national crisis, when the King was for
the moment inaccessible, the Ministers
of state were /summoned to the pres
ence of Queen. Alexandra for consulta
tion, with, as was generally understood,
most satisfactory results, says- Tit-
Bits. This was quite a new departure
for the present reign. Of course. Queen
Victoria played this sovereign part con
stantly, but her late Majesty was the
head of the state and it was the proper
course for her to pursue.
Except when considered as part of
the Kltig and sovereign, Queen Alex
andra Is not the head of the state. Sne
enjoys a position of her own. which Is
lunlque^ While It differs from that of
any other woman, married or single cr
of any rank, in some material wayi it
is also different from that of previous
Queen consorts. One of the most curi
ous and interesting provisions in the
law and customs of the state Is that the
Queen Is for private business purposes
not regarded as a married woman at
all.: She Is* the only ; woman In Great
Britain who does not come within the
scope of the married woman's property
act. ' ."
The principle of the law is that the
King is entirely different from all other
married men and that his time Is too
fully taken up with the affairs of state
for him to have any left to devote to do
mestic matters, â¢ and that therefore the
.whole management of the Queen's pri
vate business matters must devolve upon
her Majesty singly and that no responsi
bility whatever in respect to them rests
upon the King.
Therefore, if such a thing could be Im
agined as the Queen contracting debts
in her husband's name the King would
not be responsible for. them, as any other
husband would be unless he had given
due notice to tradesmen and all others
concerned that he would for the future
decline to settle all such accounts.
If the King contracted debts the law,
which says that his Majesty can do no
wrong, , would prevent anybody ] from su
ing him for recovery of the amount -due.
but no such protection Is granted to, the
Queen, who could be proceeded against
In the ordinary manner.. She has her own
attorney general and solicitor general to
represent her In all legal mattersâ though,
of course except for ordinary private pur
poses.- their services are scarcely ever
needed.
While the constitution is glad to
recognize the Queen as part . of the
monarchy. It cannot lose sight of the
fact that after all her position is lim
ited to that of Queen consort, and that
therefore she is in a large sense onÂ«
of his Majesty's subjects, and In cer
tain cases, which there Is no human
possibility of occurring in these times,
she would be treated. as a subject.- But
in other respects she is accorded privi
leges by the realm which are given to
no other person except. the King. Par
ticularly there" is no question of high
treason.
It is generally understood that the
King is â¢ the only person whom it Is
high treason to plot against, but It
would be high treason also to plot
against Queen "Alexandra." The sig
nature "Edward Rex" is attached to all
state documents of such importance as
to demand it. But in no circumstances
whatever would; the corresponding one,
"Alexendra Regina,"be allowed to*be
attached, either- in conjunction with
that-of his Majesty or without it. \u25a0
-If It should happen that the Queen
should survive the King many of the
privileges which she at present pos
sesses would be withdrawn from her,
only nominally 'in. some cases, but ac
tually in others, while constitutional
law provides that some curious re
strictions shall be placed upon her. It
would be 4 ! no s longer s high -i treason to
plot : against \ her; and , It , Is ; held by at
least' one high authority that. she could
not marry again if she wished to do so
without' the special license- and per
mission *6f the King's successor.

AN INTERCITY OCTJ&PEDB
>r -- ' RACE AT BALTTOIORB
At the suggestion of the- Patapsco Navy
the regatta committee of the i National
Association will probably add an octo
pede race to the list of events at the next
regatta, which will be held in this city
next August. This event, which will Be
a special one. will be made an intercity
contestâ that is. the men who will com
pose the crews will be selected from the
best oarsmen of the city. Instead of from
one. club, as is customary in all races
rowed under the National Association
rules. It is proposed that a contest bo
arranged between the cities of New
York. Philadelphia and Boston, and that
each of these cities pick tho best eight
oarsmen, Irrespective of tho dubs to
which they belong, make up an octopedo
crew and decide thÂ» supremacy upon
neutral water. Ah octonede is a boat
manned by eight oarsmen, with each
oarsman ; rowing two oars, making-. six- j
teen oars in all.' This stylo of boat has
but recently been added to thosÂ« used by
oarsmen in contests. It is a spectacular
event, and when the intercity phase is
added greater interest will result.
Local oarsmen are pleased with tho de-
termination of the naval board to bring
about this event, and predict great things
for rowing, and that it will greatly add
to the interest of rowing cannot bo gain
said. ?Â£?Â£Â£.Â« '*<?\u25a0
The other contests, which are twelve in
number, are: Slngle-scull \u25a0 shells, inter
mediate; single-scull shells, senior; single
scull sheila, champion: pair-oared shells,
intermediate; pair-oared shells, senior;
double-scull shells. Intermediate; double
scull shells, senior; four-oared shells, in
termediate; four-oared shells, senior; in
ternational four-oared shell, senior; eight
oared shells, intermediate; eight-oared
shells, senior.
There ara contests between clubs, and,
while they evoke considerable interest,
still they do not represent a locality, and,
therefore, while the other dubs are glad
to see their townsmen win. still tho vic
tory adds more tcf the glory of the club,
and does not create the same enthusiasm
that a race would which would be among
the best oarsmen a city could turn out.
An octopede Is peculiarly fitted for such
a contest, and it is a new feature. By
starting upon the lines as suggested by
the members of the Patapsco Navy rowing
would be advanced in popular favor, and
the same interest would be taken in the
contests which were in vogue when the
Ward brothers, the Rohrs. the Hamiir.a
and the St. John Paris crews. were bat
tling for supremacy. Whole cities turned
out to witness a single contest, and for
days In advance crowds lined the river
banks watching the crews practicing.
These crews represented localities and
were recognized as representative oars
men. While ' the Interest at the present
time is as great. If, not greater, among
the clubs, the interest, for the reason
that it 13 looked upon asi victory only for
the club, does not extend to the whole
community.; - , ,
The local oarsmen are enthusiastic over
the prospects of this feature being in
augurated In . this city. .
The t>ast week has been one of changes
in the weather and has prevented local
oarsmen from taking the practice .which
they would desire. The first part of the
week was very cold and windy, and very
few oarsmen were at the boathouses. and
those that were on hand were unable to
launch the boats on account of the histi
winds. All that the oarsmen are waiting
for is favorable weather and the season
will bÂ« in full swing.
The Ariel Rowing Club will hold its
annual benefit to-morrow nisht at the
Lyric. The Marine Band will be. the at
traction.'and a number of out-of-town
oarsmen will attend as guests of the
Ariels. A number of the local \ clubs will
also be on hand, and delegations from the
Arundel Boat Club, the Patapsco Navy
and ' the Baltimore and Ohio Athletic As
sociation will ...be .'.present. -After -the
Ariel's ' benefit the efforts of the . local
oarsmen will be confined. to tbV river and
the work will be directed toward getting
the crews in shape . for the regattas this
summer.â Baltimore American.
Home or Automobile.
You . read every day of horses ' being
frightened by automobiles, but you never
hear of an automobile being frightened
by, a horse. .. That simple statement set
tles the question . of ' the permanency . of
the automobile's advent. The mechanical
way is surer than any which trusts to
an animal. You can drive an automobile
for hours as fast as the law allows, and
even faster than that, and it will be even
a bit - better fitted - to " go 'on doing more
than when you started, but treat a horse
in that way and the humane society
would ! be after you. .You can stop an
automobile almost - instanter, but when
you try. that on\a horse you are liable to
throw 'him * down and almost certain to
strain* him to. his permanent injury. . The
few people | who , stiir insist that the au

Street Sweeping Department.
Supervisor d'Ancona declared yester
day that the attention of Auditor Baehr
will be called to the article published
in The Call to the. effect that the Board
of Public Works is employing: an assist
ant superintendent and four inspectors
from the eligible list of street sweep
ers, although the municipal budgret pro
vides for the' appointment of two in
spectors only.' The budget makes, an
appropriation of 52400 to pay the sal
aries of the two inspectors.
The Board of Works desires to pay
additional salaries, aggregating $3700,
out of the appropriation of $215,000 set
aside for the payment of men actually,
engaged in the sweeping of streets, but
the Supervisors' Finance Committee
holds that no more than $2400 can be
used.

The F. M. | Yorke Company, .which was
awarded the contract for the .restoration

of side sewers for ..the fiscal . year 1904

As a consequence,. there are now 126 side

paved j and probably j will not be until a
new contract Is awarded for the fiscal
year, 1905-1906. â¢; . ... \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ S" :' -.;./
The Yorke Company was formally noti
fied by the Board of Works to>repave
over the trenches, but the notifications
were ignored and -. the Board., of Works
did not press the firm to carry out its
orders. : . /
Numerous complaints have ; been re
ceived from property owners In regard to
the matter. The streets In various parts
of the v city are littered, with the debris
resulting: from tearing them up. The
firm was given the contract at the rate
of . 10 cents : per square^- foot of. (bitumen.
In all likelihood the new contract will be
awarded -at 1 a higher rate.: .A new, com
plication is sure to result,' as. the prop
erty owners will .claim that the. work
should be done at the old rate of 10" cents.
In that event the Board â¢of Works will
have to provide the difference in the cost
under the new contract. . â¢ N'nV^

WASITOTCTOX, July 8. â A* a remit
of die investigations by secret service
nSfcmt* into the cfcarses made hy Rich
ard Chcathnm, secretary of the Cotton
Plamters' Association, thnt Information
had bees circa to cotton brokers la
New York by some prrtoo or persona In
the Bureau of Statistics, Department
of Agriculture, Secretary Wilson to-day
made public an official report in which
he states that Hdrrln S. Holmes, the
assistant statistician, has been apalltj
of "Juffcllngr" the official report.
The report says It bas been found
that Holmes communicated advance in
formation to L a Van Riper, a New
York broker, and JL Haas of New York,
who acted a> a go-between in convey
ing: Information from Holmes to other
New York brokers, including: Theodore
H. Price. Steps have been taken by
Secretary Wilson to prevent any fur
ther leakage of the department figures,
end an entire reorganization of the
Bureau of Statistics and the manner of
preparing monthly crop reports has
been outlined by him. The papers in
connection with the investigation were
referred to the United States District
Attorney for the District of Columbia,
and he has reported that, in his opinion,
a criminal prosecution will not lie
agralnst Holmes. Holmes has been dis
missed from the service of the depart
ment.
V. H. Olmstead has been appointed
assistant statistician of the Department
of Agriculture, to succeed xiolmes.
BnOKER RKVEALS THE PLOT.
According to the report, William Judd,
of New York, formerly In the employ of
L. C. Van Riper, induced the latter to
tell of his connection with Holmes and
then communicated the information to
Cheatham. Van Riper became the prin
cipal witness in the investigation con
ducted by the secret service and said he
was Induced to communicate the fact
that advance information was being glv
- en out by Holmes because he had heard
that Holmes and his assistants had In
tended to try to manipulate the June
cotton report. Using- this information as
a foundation, the secret service agents
interviewed numerous persons who had
been mentioned by Judd and Van Riper,
and gathered a mass of correspondence,
Including many letters written by
Holmes to Van Riper and others. The'
charges by Cheatham were backed up"
with evidence that information had been
given to cotton brokers in New York by
come person or persons employed in the
Bureau of Statistics relative to the acre
age and condition of the cotton crop of
the United States prior to the official pub
lication and crop figures had been tam
pered with in the department in the in
terest of certain cotton speculators.
Holmes is the only employe of the Gov
ernment who had been found to have
had any connection with supplying infor
mation to brokers prior to the publication
of the official report.
OPERATIONS OF HOLMES.
After reviewing the charges. Secretary
Wilson gives a summary of the testimony
adduced before secret service agents. Van
Riper, the New York broker, under ex
amination said he became acquainted
with Holmes in New York in August,
1904, through a "mutual friend." Ac
cording to this testimony. Holmes told
Van Riper he could get information con
cerning the Government crop report,
principally through the report of the gen
eral agent and the reports of the State
agents.
Van IMper said Holmes furnished him
with information from time to time for
Beveral months in advance of the publi
cation of the official figures and that
the information given by Holmes cor
responded exactly with the figures aft
erward published as the official crop
reports. Van Riper stated that Haas
of New York acted as a go-between for
Holmes and himself and he was given
to understand that Haas was securing
Information for Theodore H. Price, a
cotton broker of New York.
The witness said he met Haas at the
Hotel Waldorf and was told by him
that the report for June, 1905, would
be 75 per cent on condition and 12% or
13 per cent on acreage, which was as
bearish as they could make It; that he
was. going to see Price, with whom he
would have an Interview, and that he
\u25a0wanted to see Van Riper after he saw
Price. In about an hour Haas called
on him and said that at the request of
Price he was going to Washington to
see if they could not get the percentage
a little higher and the acreage a little
smaller to make the report more bear
ish. Van Riper testified that the offi
cial report was more bearish than the
figures previously given him and that
he took this to mean that the effort to
influence the report had succeeded.
SHOWS IXCRIMIXATIXG LETTERS.
The letters' i-rcsented by. Van Riper,
which he alleged were written by
Holmes, were all signed with the Ini
tial "H." Most of these letters were
for the purpose of making appoint
ments with Van Riper, but the follow
ing: note, dated August SO, 1904. shows
the relationship between Holmes and
Van Riper:
"If you had bought any of that stuff,
sell it out at once and sell as much as
you can in addition. We are going to
show a very slight decline and as this
is totally unexpected it will send things
down like fury. Other parties will
close out to-morrow and sell on Thurs
day. Where is P? Tear this up.; It
may go up a little before Friday, but
probably not."
This letter was signed with the ini
tial "H." Van Riper testified that all
of the letters surrendered .. were ; from
Holmes and that their contents " bad

reference to the state of the- cotton re
port. ; ; -\u25a0 " \u25a0' \ . \u25a0 '\u25a0\u25a0_\u25a0\u25a0': .
A large number of letters "and, tele
grams signed with the Initial /'F" were
sent from New York ' to 'Van Riper.
Nearly all of these contained* Informa
tion concerning .the cotton; report,* to
gether . with Instructions ; to sell ' or ; buy
on the market, according to. the infor
mation supplied, and all of them closed
with the admonition to destroy the let
ter. ,
The secret service agents learned
that "P" referred to in Holmes'^letter
was **F. A- Peckham" of New York and
that the letters signed wiiu the initial
"F" were written by F. A. Peckham. '
Peckham was Interviewed In 'New
York City and said that .the only ex
planation he had to give concerning. the
letters was that he was trying to make
some money In the cotton market, de
clining to say anything of his relations
with Holmes, Haas or Van Riper.
Shortly after he was Interviewed it was
learned that Peckham came to Wash
ington and held a conversation with
Holmes over the telephone, in which he
Inquired whether Holmes Intended to
resign his position or whether he ex
pected to be dismissed from, the Gov
ernment service.
HOLMES PARTNER OF BROKERS.
The first Questions asked Holmes
were as to his relations with Peck
ham and Van Riper. \ Holmes said that
they all had been on very intimate
terms socially and that when he had
occasion to visit New York, which was
frequently, his hotel bills had been
paid by Van Riper or Peckham. Holmes
admitted that Peckham. Haas and him
self were at one time associated In an
adventure in which Holmes was to
have an interest equal to the sum of
$6000 which he. was to receive as a
gift from the other members of the
firm. Subsequently Haas transferred
his interest in this ? firm, to L. C. Van
Riper and Van Riper stated that the
company was organized for the pur
pose of handling cotton. Holmes tes
tified that this was true, but, that he
was not aware of the nature of the
organization at the time he was given
an Interest in it and that when .he
learned that the object of the company,
was to handle cotton he \u25a0 withdrew
from it. .- .
Under further examination Holmes
stated that, he had sold to Van Riper
about February- 19, 1905, a three
fourths Interest In some mining prop
erty in Idaho for 573,000, this amount
having been paid to him by, Van Riper
in two installments In currency." :
. Secretary Wilson Bays there seems to
be every " reason to believe, ~ from the re
port of the secret service agents, Hhat
Holmes could have given approximate
ly correct Information^ anywhere .'from
one to three days , in advance . of the
publication of the official ; report. '
It was found that alterations had
been made in the figures of a report for
October 50,. 1903, and that these alterat
ions appeared "to be' In r Holmes' ' hand
writing. *'v \ - ' ,- : '.- ' r-\u25a0,'.;'r -\u25a0,'.;' '

made: a .public statement :!' to-day,**, in'
which he declared he had nothing what
ever to do with plans to manipulate
the Government cotton' report. He said:'

"I was also cognizant of the fact that
Holmes had' previously furnished ad
vance information :to certain brokers
from time to time, but when their plans
for changing. the cottqn report figures
were exposed to me I Immediately con
sulted my ) attorney regarding the mat
ter and- upon his advice listened to
their J stories and: kept track- of -their
plans, in , some cases having witnesses,
unknown to them, until the June report
came out. .-:.
TWO CLEAN-UPS ON REPORT.
"It was planned as early; as March to
use every effort they, could to secure
figures that would be as bearish as pos
sible,; so as to break the price of cotton
to the low point where certain interests
could make large profits on the short
side and then load. up and make an enor
mous scoop on the long side.* It was un
derstood that in some cases Government
agents' reports would be influenced in
that direction. . ;.
"On June 1 I was Informed that it was
impossible to get the condition i higher
than 75 per cent and the acreage â¢ reduc
tion' to show a decrease of less than 13
per cent in spite of all they, had Â» tried to

would be construed; as bearish and en

Captain Spillane
Says There Was
Negligence.
. While five men, were working, in the
basement of the four-story \u25a0 apartment
house under construction at -.229 Ninth
street, corner of Tehama, yesterday aft
ernoon, It suddenly .. collapsed and : fell
down upon themi burying J, them in the
ruins, killing one and . badly Injuring two
others. , Another escaped with only a
slight injury and the fifth , was ; unhurt.
The dead man was Samuel V Cowap, ... a
plumber, who lived ;at . - 132 . / Harrison
street. His head .was pierced by a spike.:
The injured "are: Dennis Horgan, : plumb
er, 24 Fell street; Mori - Garguilo, -plumb
er's helper, 7 Chamber place, \ and Louis
Brandt, foreman of plumbers, 1117 \u25a0 Ma
son street. Charles McLaughlin of 133
Fifth street emerged unhurt, 'though -all
around - him were scattered the | death
dealing iron and splinters.
Immediately after the accident \u25a0a | fire
alarm was turned In. Engine Company
No. 8 of the Fire Department, the hos
pital emergency ambulance and the patrol
wagon hurried to j the scene. Morgan and
Garguilo were easily extracted from the
wreckage, but it was fully an hour before
the , body, of Cowap was secured. , He lay
burled underneath tons of fallen board's,
his body, â¢pinned ' tightly over -a water
pipe, crushed and bleeding -from : many
wounds. .He .had beenVcaught as he was
running } along 'â¢â¢ the g iron ,' pipe I after â¢ the
first creaking that had!warnedhlm of the
danger.. A- f alllng*llmber had.tMrown him.
across the " water 'mainland -another > had
forced a cruel; four-inch", spike through hla
skulL Death "was instantaneous.'.'
NEGLIGENCE- ALLEGED. v
The of -McLaughlln, was t .almost
miraculous.'. ;'He was v working directly In
front of the weak structure,- filling In the
ditch in which the electric wires 'were
placed. - . The building fell forward,/com
pletely \u25a0â¢-: covering ; him. Jagged splinters
and sharp j iron : and heavy, studding were
all about' him, 'yet : he -i.dug ,his way : out
and i.waa> the ', first i to V tellftthe I firemen

men.
According, to . Captain Spillane of the
Southern Statlon,*\who â¢ made * an \ investi
gation ;of the ; premises ; immediately ; after
the accident,* the caused of the catastrophe
was the '\u25a0 negligent : manner in which,, the
building was " constructed. There was no
wind blowing to 'strains the timbers,' nor
was there j any great weight on the roof.
The rafters on s the top arid third stories
seemed to give way with a loud creaking,
reported â¢ Captain Spillane, and then fell
in, i giving the men employed below, no
possible chance to ' run to.a place of
safety."* '-"' .'\u25a0' ". ' ' : \u25a0'\u25a0 , .'\u25a0 ' '\u25a0'''.:\u25a0."\u25a0\u25a0-'\u25a0

LEAVES FOUR CHILDREN.
The death of Cowap brings .with .it a
pitiful tale of misfortune.' \u25a0.'; He was a poor
man, a widower, and .every cent that he
earned went to the support of his four
children. One of ; these, Willie, aged five,
lies In the' Children's Hospital, never 'to
walk again, the victim : of an Incurable
hip disease.. The others, , Marguarita,
aged twelve; Emma,; aged ten,* and Marie,

MAY SUTTON CROWNED TENNIS QUEEN
LITTLE CALIFORNIA GIRL WHO BECAME THE TKNKK CHAMPION Of THE
WORLD YESTERDAY AT LONDON BY DEFEATING MISS DOUGLASS, ,'THE
BKITIEH EXPERT, DECISIVELY IN TWO STRAIGHT. SETS.
WIZARD LEAVES
FOR THE SOUTH
Jake Schaefer, the "Wizard Knight of
the Cue," who has been playing exhibi
tion games here for a few day 3, leaves
this afternoon for Los Angeles.
Schaefer's visit, has been one purely
for pleasure and health,, prior to his trip
to France, where he and Vignaux, ! the
only two billiardlEts among millions of
billiard players, ' are to cross cues once
more for the world's championship. This
time the match is to be *'one in."
It was thought the limit had been
reached at the IS-inch balk line game
when "two in" was allowed, meaning that
the player must get an object Lall out
side the balk lines on the second shot.
The kind of game the champions now
propose precludes everything but open
table play. This way it haa been from
the early stages of billiard playing on the
old 12x6 tables,; the champion* mastering
the details with such accuracy as to* re
quire more restrictions placed upon {heir
play, increasing the difficulties to success.
From general 'round the ' table play to
the discovery of rail nursing by Schaefer,
lines were drawn diamond shape ou the
table and in this, called the "champion"
game, restrictions were similar to those
in the six, eight, .twelve and eighteen
inch balk line game that followed. The
one cushion, two, three and even four
cushion style came in to make matters
more difficult' and now" comes the "one
in." Â»? '- : ' \u25a0 \u25a0'. â¢ :: '- '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 â¢{-. \u25a0â¢ -;â¢.
"What will be next?" was asked of the
wizard. " : - '
"I don't know. This is Vignaux's idea.
I've defeated him at about everything
else and he may have -it on me at this
game." â¢. .
Few people realize that Schaefer is but
50 years of age. He has been playing
billiards since he was 6 years old in his
father's place in Leaven worth, Kans..
when they packed a box around for him
to stand on and shoot. He has been
known as a- champion â¢â¢â¢ for \u25a0 more than
thirty-five yea.rS, hence, a general- esti
mate that he must be very far advanced
in age. Speaking to some friends la3t
night he told- of .his first experiences, or
some of them, in California.
"I came here from Milwaukee in 1574,
San Jose being the first place of any im
portance I Struck. Those were good days '
for roohey^ahdithe Spaniards arOund the
old Auz<rgis House were -pin-pool .< wild.-
When I Jefffafire they all had their cues
in the rack am I had a fairly good start
for this city." " - .

When. Oscar GrÂ«ham. ;: g'ets tfiat :.old
: south r.'ing bt his 'working light, nobody's
ball team has a license to. ac^re any runs
off .hlni. For many moons Oscar did not
hold .' cppoelng Latsnieh ; under the spell
:of â¢ his twisters, but yesterday afternoon
he rounded up right once more and the
Angels kept swinging: their hfeads off all
afternoon without clouting any runs in.
Score, Oakland S, Los Angeles 0.
* It was the spit .ball. again that brought
home victory to tho Commuters. Graham
made it shoot ln.'a'nd 'out. U P and down
and every \yay he fancied. Los Angeles
did .not 'have' 11- chance to get a 'run in
any single -inning, .for the Commuters
played like big leaguers] behind Graham.
Big. Wright, dropped his first game since
becoming an Angel. 'The former' Cleve
land star managed to get away with four
without a miss, but yesterday 'he fell
"down. He was not lilt 'hard, but the
Commuters clouted his' benders when a
hit was the-thlng' needed most. Thori in
the eighth^ \u25a0.wnght'became a bit wild and
handed ; one -to his opponents. \u25a0\u25a0; â¢ *
.: Van Haltrcn started it off ' for Oakland
â¢with one ., gone .in round , four. -He
"got'a pass and Fnincks walloped one.tu
Dillon. The big first baseman booted the
ball and Van Haltren tried to go to third,
but was nailed'at the bag while Frnncks
scooted to second. Before Wright Could
warm up again,' Kelly slapped a- two
cushloner over : third ' and Dunleavy
dumped' one to righttield, making a; pair
of runs with two nien stowed away.
After that Wright se.ttled' and hafl the
Indian sign on the Commuters till the
eighth, when, with; two. gone again, Mos
kiman â¢ shoved : one j past short and .Red
responded with a drive to the
right garden. Wright had the jimmies
and'pas^ed Byrnes.'He still retained them
when Graham faced 'him; executing, a
wild pitch that- "let: Moskiman come
tfirough. \u0084',". " _'
Francks played ./great tfaseball at short,
eating up several that looked '.like hits
for fair. Moskiman* \u25a0 took. th 6 throws at
first just as- though' he had played the
positori all his life. Bra""shear was the
only Angel who had. his eye. on the ball.
He walloped Graham for a pair of two
sackers, but neither, did any good. - The

NEW, YORK, July jS.â Artful, the
three-year-old daughter \pf the ; great
Hamburg,' galloping in f font v of her
field from the start and eased up' at
the finish, .carried; the colors ; of the
Whitney Stable- to victory to-day in the
Erighton Handicap, the. richest all
aged purse of the. racing year. 'A
length and a half back of the winner
came Ort Wells, winner of the Bright
on mild and a slight favorite for the
handicap. ', Eight lengths further back
the great mare Beldame, beaten mor:?
decisively than in almost any race .of
her career, came home in third place,
thoroughly done. Trailing along in
the ruck were Monsieur BeaucaJre, Dolly
Spanker^. Dejhi -find Adbell.
Fully 25,000 persona, v/ero packed
within the narrow limits of the Bright
on Beach track, aud the enthusiastic
manner in which- they cheered Artful*
splendid /victory- indicated" that,. the
great bulk' of the. public's money had
been placed on" the' chancc-fl of the
Whitney mare. The afternoon was
showery and ! by the ". time ihe great
race, the fourth. on the card, was start
ed,' tho going had begun "to be sticky.
Artful galloped. the mile and a quarter
in 2:0411, an excellent performance un
der the conditions. By her, victory to
day Artful Avon the title of champion
filly of the year. â¢ - ;â¢ \u25a0 ,
Throughout the bdtting to-day,
which was : heavy at all times, there
was hardly a point's difference in the
quoting, of prices on Artful and Ort
Wells. ' At the beginning some booka
marked .' up -7 to 5 against Ort Wells,
3 to -s against Artful, 4 to 1 against
Beldame,' with liberal odds against the
other " stfirters. Prices 'generally" rO3e
throughout the ring. At the close Ort
Wells, was a slight .favorite, at 2 to 1.
Artful -was to be had at 11 to 5, while
Beldame's ; price, after rising to 5, was
hammered down at the close to 16 to.oJ
Ivan ;the : Terrible, St. Bellane'and Ort r

TE.MMS CRACKS QUIT ETEX /
EV FAST PRACTICE MATCH
Many Racket Wlelders ArÂ« Resting
After Tournament and Courts
Are Deserted.
There was little dolnff on the tennis
court 3 yesterday. No tournaments
were scheduled and but few practice
matches were played. Many of the
cracks are still resting after their ef
forts at ,San Rafael, while others ara
out of ' town. The best match on the
California Club courts was a doubles
in -which the opposing teams were
Harry Rolfe and Melville Long and
Herbert Long and Frank Mitchell.
Honors were divided, each side win
ning and losing two sets. Rolfe and
M. Long set a fast pace In the first two
sets, both of which they won. Mitchell
and H/ Long improved In the third and
fourth sets, which they' won by 6-4
scores. The score was 6-3, 10-8, 4-6,
4-6.
Dr. McChesney and Herbert Long
played a fast singles match. Long won
the first set by a small margin, but
McChesney allowed him- only one game
in the next two sets. It was a give and
take affair, with both players driving
continually. The score was 5-7. 6-I,' 6-0.
. Veteran TV. S. MaeGavin proved that
he; is not in the Osier class by playing
a tieywith Harold Gabriel, a clever,
young crack. MaeGavin won the. first
set*, but grew tired in the second, which
went to his opponent. The "score was
6-4, 3-6." Henry Mills took Harry Rolfe
into camp in a one-set match. The
score was 7-5.
Edison's Direct Alms.
There has been a report current for
some time that Thomas A. Edison would
turn his attention to perfecting the mar
velous storage -battery of which he has
from time to time given some hint. Mo
torists are agreed that if such a battery
can be made a commercial possibility the
construction of motor cars will be revo
lutionized. The essential advantage that
Mr. Edison claims for his battery is that
it will, when perfected, combine enormous
potential power with a weight so incon
siderable as to make its employment ap
plicable to any class of vehicle. ' This la
the very >thing that the builders of auto
mobiles have tried the hardest to obtain
âgreat power from a battery of nominal
weight.â Metropolitan Magazine. BSSB!

A BUNGALOW CHAT.
The word bungalow, as used in
this and the chats that are to fol-
low from week to week, can best
be defined by the uÂ«Â« of synonyms,
such as: Comfortable house; beau-
tiful house; well-built house* coty
bouse; easy-to-take-carc-of house;
a nerve and labor caver; a thing
of beauty and a isr forever, and so
on â ad lnfinltum. There Is a charm
In a bouse of this kind that Is hard
to describe, but quickly felt by any i
who have ever lived In one. One
might write a book and illustrate .
It from cover to .cover, and still
give but a faint idea of the beauty
of consmictlon and finish of a
BUNGALOW. In order that my
readers may see for themselves
what a Bungalow 1b like. I extend
herewith an Invitation to all lov-
ers of the home and the House

SEVERE TESTS BY HARES
Blue Belle Defeat* Marigold in Flaal
of Consolation Stake at Ingle
side Park.
One round of the open stake and a
consolation stake for the dogs beaten
in the former furnished the programme
yesterday at Ingleside Coursing' Park.
The coursing was hard on the dogs, as
the hares were demons. It was the dog
which could stay that generally raised
the nag. The consolation. stake was. won
by George Wright's Blue Bell, which
beat Marigold in an exciting. trial in. the
final. â¢ ' .
The dogs were slipped to a strong rab
bit. Marigold, which was a 5 to 4 shprt
end, went unsighted, but finally caught
track of the game after Blue Bell had
driven it to a turn. When the dogs
came together it was nip and tuck, the
flag finally going to Biue Bell by a. score

A good many, schools have departments
where girls are taught domestic science
in a more or less theoretical way, but it
remains for Nebraska to establish at Its
State university a course in which young
women -may be instructed in the art of
spending money to advantage. ; Every
woman, of course, knows how to spend
money in the sense of paying it out for
something, , but it is the belief of a good
many, men that she is so anxious to get
rid of any funds she may have in her
possession that she does not receive their
value. - It Is to show her ' how to " make
her outlay wisely and Judiciously thatthe
new department is to be established. It

but however the task Is to be performed,

In the shape of actual goods, , it la pro

of values In meats,"" groceries and -dry
goods, how to distinguish between cotton
and wool fabrics; In short, to teach them
that large share of the science of house
keeping which consists : of Judicious" buy-
Ing. Possibly â¢ this art,may ; be -taught In

MINERS DECIDE
TO ATTACK LAW
Benjamiti Says Hy.draulicking
Measure ' Win Be tested.
MILLIONS T&E PRIZE OF VICTORY
: Everything will be done that is pos
sible,' declares President Benjamin. of ,the
California Miners' Association;" to have
the Caminetti law tested soon in 'a. court
of last 'resort. Messrs.. Golinsky ? and
Wehe, attorneys, for the association, have
been instructed to- proceed"with;due;dili
gence and the time is approaching, when
the great issues ; that are : tied up k with
the Caminetti measure will .be settled.
Whether a permit to ' proceed with ; hy
draulic mining, Issued by and under regu
lations -provided by the California | Debris
Commission,, is valid," la a leading ; issue.
In some instances -where' = such permits
have' been issued,- injunctions issued : by
courts â¢ have put [aj stop '\u25a0 to hydraulicklng.
"If the law, is not good," ?said President
Benjamin yesterday, "it ; is - time that the
fact be known. The California .Miners'
Association is in earnest in this matter.
We wish, to know just where , mining
stands in regard to the law and so are go
ing to do the best we can-to find out as
soon as may be. Heretofore obstacles have
been encountered in our attempts to have
the Caminetti law fully . interpreted. . This
has been due principally to - questions
raised by the Anti-Debris Association rel
ative to the validity of permits that were
issued by the debris commissioners. :\u25a0 In
one case that the California Miners'/As
sociation took- up/ it was found that no
permit had been issued., In another case
we lost in the Superior Court because of
some informality in the; permit."' -
WILL BATTLETO FINISH.
President Benjamin added that the en
tire matter will be carled to a flnlÃh.
If the Supreme Court of the State of Call
fornia finds adversely to the California
miners, the suit will be taken on appeal
to the Supreme Court of the ' United
States. He also said that the Anti r Debris
Association is willing to waive any ques
tion about the form of permit in. the
Polar Star case, so that the law may be
tested on its merits and be interpreted
by the highest court in the land, if neces
sary.
Events have been . steadily leading up
to the determination to have all the is
sues Involved in the Caminetti law
brought to a conclusion." Successive con
ventions of the California Miners' Asso
ciation I have adopted : resolutions, all in
the same direction, .and the "last annual
meeting of the association went so far
as to send a memorial , to President Roose
velt, in behalf of the interests repre
sented by the hydraulic miners, for a gen
eral investigation of the f conditions at
tending the depositing of debris In the
beds of Etrearns in this State. : The result
has been the sending of a special agent
of the Geological Survey to California,
who Is now engaged in viewing, all Bec
tions where debris has been dropped and
aIL sections that are subject to. the de
positing of materials through - natural
erosion. ,".. ',;'" . .
NORTHERN COUNTIES EARNEST.
Since the convention some .; bitterness
has been manifested in northern mining
counties of California over, the existing
situation. Quite bitter criticism has been
made of the California Debris Commis
sion, -which President. Benjamin says- is
unjust, us the Commissioners have acted
conscientiously throughout. The Anti-
Debris Association has been active re
cently and interest ' is on edge through
out the mining- sections and also .in all
sections that are affected by the mining
debris as to the next move." For this rea
son the announcement of President Ben
jamin will be received with . peculiar and
general interest, for millions of dollars
annually are at' stake on the outcome of
the future. N . "
That there are many millions of dol
lars in the sands of California that may
be saved by hydraulicklng very few
persons in the State' will question.
Whether they -can be extracted with
out damage to. the farmers is the con
cern- of ;all the. agricultural counties
that are so situated that they can! be
affected by debris.;- The -millions j in
comparatively easy ; reach are the in
centive for renewing the struggle. ,
President Benjamin says that some
explanation of the attitude of the Cali
fornia miners , to the Caminetti â¢ act ; is
due, in view of the fact \u25a0 that the pas
sage of the law was -procured through
the exertions of the California Miners'
Association. 'i- When .a court -decision
put a stop to hydraullcking.it was cvi-[
dent that something must be done, be
cause the interests that -were involved
were great. It was the opinion of the
miners that hydraulicklng .â¢ could;} be
continued with restraining dams' to
hold back the debris from the ' beds' of
rivers. -"/. .'g. \u25a0 -
What was known as the Biggs com
mission was created, i- which made ,an

ommendations.' . Then t the ; California
Miners' Association' went before ,Con

LACKING LV ENTERPRISE
Complain That Our Many and
. Varied Resources Are Not
Being Properly Developed
BY JAMES S. TTLEH.
Staff Correspondent of The Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON*. July S. â San Francisco
and California from an Eastern point
of view certainly are Interesting stud
ies. The Lewis and Clark fair at
Portland. Or., has attracted many peo
ple to the Pacific Northwest and near
ly all of these have continued their
trip from Oregon to California. Wash
ington seems to have been included in
the return trJp itinerary of many, for
the registers of the local hotels have
borne evidence to frequent visits of
Mr. Somebody of "San Francisco, CaL"
At first it was believed that San
Franciscans had suddenly determined
to ccc the sights of the capital city.
Later it developed that the unusual
number of registrations was due to the
return of persons to Eastern points
from the Pacific Coast via Washington.
The stories of some of the tourists,
their impressions of the coaÃt and their
criticism and praises are of some ob
jective value â if properly considered
by the people of "the Far West."
" And by the way, the "Far West" Is
almost as far as "the Far East" in the
minds of many people of Xew York.
Boston. Philadelphia and Baltimore.
Xew York seems to know a little some
thing about California, but Boston,
Baltimore and Philadelphia know
about as much of San Francisco and
the Golden State as the average coast
man knows of the Trans-Siberian
Railroad. Even those who have visited
San Francisco are wont to Judge the
bare hills of Contra Costa a criterion
of California's agricultural worth.
They know nothing of productive So
noma, the marvelously beautiful and
fruitful Napa hills or the astonishing
richness of the Sacramento Valley,
which could produce in one season
enough of every form of food to keep
any three Atlantic States from starva
tion for ten years.
too siucn of pnr.\ES.
But I am getting a little away from
the subject. I cannot very well help
it. We hear too much of prunes and
"colonies" and things that are only the
scratching of the surface of California.
The literature that is spread broadcast
here means nothing. It is merely a lot
of statistics about land that few East
ern men can afford to buy. and gives'
no adequate idea of the possibilities of
men engaging in other industries than
raising fruit.
The Easterner who has visited the
coast and who is now in Washington
voices this declaration. He is charmed
with California and sees in it some
thing that he thinks Is "still unde
.veloped." He knows that prunes and
raisins and irrigated peaches are good,
but he cannot understand why every
pamphlet that is issued from a Cali
fornia rress should be used as a fruit
stand advocate or an advertisement for
an alfalfa-fed cow. He sees In Cali
fornia new mines, new oil fields, new
lands for things that the world needs.
He cannot understand why we do not
manufacture more.
Years ago, the stern critic argues,
California complained that the fuel
question was a great detriment to the
development of her industries. She
could not manufacture in competition
with the East because the price of coal
was too high. Now California has oil
fiel/Js that are capable of turning out
fuel oil enough to run the machinery
of two continents and yet there is a
halt. Why? No man in California'
seems able to answer this question and
no man in tne East can understand why
he cannot.
"You have oil, coal, lumber, miner
als and money," said Alvin P. llur
tfock. leader of an excursion from Cen
tral Pennsylvania, whose home is in
Pittsburg. "Why don't you start
something?"
PRAISES CALIFORNIA WINES.
I don't think that Mr. Murdock fully
realized that to "start something" re
quires capital, but he certainly realized
that we had something in California
besides prunes that ought to be started.
I think every prune man in the State
will agree with me when I say that
there have been enough prunes "start
ed" in California to answer the de
mands of the present market for some
time to come and that he will also
agree that this is said for the very best
Interests of the State and with a view
to directing attention to other indus
tries that can, by proper manipulation,
help both themselves and the prune
growers immensely.
For example: George Runnell. who
was with a party of tourists from Bos
ton, said that his traveling companions
were much impressed with the excel
lency of California wines.' â
"Don't you have California wines in
Boston?" I asked.
"TeÂ«. wa Co. I know something
about them and I know how to order.
I don't think a well-matured sauterne
or a carefully selected claret of Califor
nia Is a fraction behind a French wine.
The average California wine is better.
But the trouble lies with the Eastern
salesman. He imports from California
a mixture of pomace and sugar and
coloring and calls it "California wine."
To tell you the truth, for your State's
benefit, your wines are spoken of with
smair^favor by other, than those who

your wines have a bad name in the

Continuing, Runnell said: "I don t
think that there is half enough atten

France owes nearly half her prosper

EASTERN OPINION DIVIDED. .
As to San Francisco Eastern opinion
Is divided. Every visitor who returns
from San Francisco speaks in glowing
terms of the hospitality of the people.
He is obviously impressed with the
size of the city and its business de
velopment, but he is equally dissatis
fied with its lack of care of municipal
person. The climate â summer climate
â bothers them some. They have an
idea before departure for the "Far
West" that palm trees grow on East
street and roses bloom on the cable
cars. They think that light duck trous
ers and umbrellas are the proper thing
and vthat one gets so dry that a mint
Julep is : necessary every twenty min
utes to keep the irrigating canal in the
human throat from shrinking up alto
gether.
Naturally an Eastern man goes to
San Francisco with two wrong ideas:
First, that it is not bo large a, city -as
advertised, but that in^that haven no
one ever 1 gets struck by . lightning,
prostrated by heat, curled up in a cy
clone or bit by a mad dog. -In this he
is right, but he includes the hope that
he la going to live, under a bamboo tree
and strum a banjo or guitar during his
sojourn. The second, impression is that
he is going to the extreme of the "Far
West." That en route he will see wild
Indians and on 'arrival 'will- be regaled
with" gambling establishments on the
sidewalk and a "wide-open . town" such
as he has read about In dime novels.
The great bustling, busy, life-strug
gling, building:, money-making, money
seeking San Francisco |is enough to
take his breath away. He gets to the
ferry dep*ot with his luggage and feels
almost as -much at sea as he would on
arrival at New York. ;He hears the
roar of the streets and the clang of
the car bells. The man with. the coach
is there, too, and the policeman and
newsboy by scores. On closer obser
vation he commences to criticize.
STREETS ARE NEGLECTED.
Charles V. Crompton. .who ' is

other night that he was both tremen
dously surprised and equally disap

The Fire Commissioners \u25a0 have had
T. G. Ward, a member of Truck 3,
on trial for having on July 3 engaged
in an altercation with Joseph Nannefy,
a hoseman'of Engine 19, which is quar
tered in the same ; building on Market
street, near Tenth. Ward's hand was
broken in the quarrel by Nannery, who
used a "spanner", to inflict the injury,
after Ward had blackened his eye for
making an Insulting remark. ,
The "evidence disclosed the fact that
Ward had picked up an ax to defend
himself from Nannery and M. 'Crosby,
another member of the engine \u25a0\u25a0 com
pany. The testimony .was so contra
dictorythat \u25a0 Commissioner Barrett re
marked ; that : "somebody was lying,"
and he advised the companies to organ
ize themselves into a truth society.
"Ward was fined two days' pay and Nan
