and we must take our time. There will;
probably turn out to be a dozen different
ways In which ' the ; thing might be ' done," \u25a0
and- we shall have Xo choose between
them. It will mean watching the house ;
for at least a- week in any case; it may

On the whole, however, , this conver- v
sation left me less 'than' lukewarm ; and :
I 'still remember ". } the .depression- which
came' upon .me^wheiT: Raffles 1 was; gone.
I j saw ' the folly ; of '"{ the . entefprls* jto "
which rl* had "committed . myselfâ the
' sheer/ gratuitous, unnecessary foily..; of
% " it. And \ the ; paradoxes -: in whlchi^ Raf- *=
fies reveled and the frivolous casuistry.
"And do you suppose I should be
keen on it If we hadn't?" cried Raffles.
"My dear fellow, I would rob St. Paul's
Cathedral if I could, but I could no
more scoop a till when the shop-walker
wasn't looking than I could b^g the
apples out of an old woman's basket..
Even that little business last month
was a sordid affair, but it was neces
sary, and I think its strategy redeemed
it to some extent. Now, there's
some credit, and more sport, in going
where they boast they're on their
guard against you. The Bank of
England, for example, is an- ideal
crib; Lut that would need half a
dozen of us with years to. give to the
job; and meanwhile Reuben Rosen
thall is high enough game for you and me.
We know he's armed. We know-how
Billy Purvis can fight. It'll bbrfd soft
thing, I grant you. But what of that,. my
good Bunnyâ what of that? A man's
reach must exceed his grasp, dear boyj
or what the dickens Is a heaven^ for?"
"I would rather we didn't exceed. burs
Just yet," I answered, laughing,, for 'his
spirit was irresistible, and. the plan- was
growing upon me. "despite my qualms.
hear that challenge. Bunny, and I, for
one, must take it up. I was only sorry I
couldn't get on my hind legs and say so
then and there."
. t "Well." I said, "I don't sec the neces
sity as things are with us; but, of
course, I'm your man."
My tone may have been half-hearted. I
did my best to make it otherwise. But it
was barely a month since our Bond street
exploit, and we certainly could have af
forded to behave ourselves for Borne time
to come. We had been getting along so
nicely; by his advice I had- scribbled a
thing or two; inspired by Raffles, I had
even done an article on our own Jewel
robbery; and for the moment I was quite
EaHsSed with this sort of adventure. '.' I
thought we ought to know when we were
wifll off, and could see no point In our
running fresh risks before we were
obliged. On the other hand,' l was'anx-'
lous not to show the leas.t disposition to'
break the pledge that I had' given a
month ago. But it was not on my man
ifest disinclination that Raffles fastened.
"Necessity, my dear Bunny? , Docs
the writer only write when the wolf i&
at the door? Does the painter paint
for bread alone? Must you and 1 be
driven to crime like Tom of Bow and
Dick of Whitechapel? You pain me,
my dear chap; you needn't laugh, be
cause you do. Art for art's sake is" a
vile catchword, but I confess it appeals
to me. In this case my motives are
absolutely pure, for I doubt if we shall
ever be able to dispose of such pecu
liar stones. But If I don't have a try
for them â after to-night â I shall never
be able to hold up my head again."
His eyes twinkled, but it glittered,
too. â¢ . .

me, nothing." '' *
â¢ He locked - hard ; at me* from under the
broken â¢ brim, \u25a0 of a ; battered billycock.

with ;me.whe"n I've anything on. Bui
here's .an end of it,' Bunny, so 'far as
you're concerned. , I'm going home now,
arid '\u25a0 I want you to follow me; but for

he'^was off again, a decrepit vagabond,
with his hands in his pockets, his elbows
squared ' and frayed coat-tails swinging
raggedly from side 'to side. .
I followed. blriV, to the Finchley Road.
There be _ took an Atlas omnibus, and
I sat some rows behind him on the top,

'who would "only smoke. one brand of ,cigar

insatiable artist, and It .charmed , away
wh^t.mpftin.cation there still remained In
me.' Once. more I felt the fascination of
a comrade, who was forever dazzling one
with a fresh aridjUnsuspected facet of his
character.' . ;,-; r
As 'we neared Piccadilly I wondered
what he . would do. Surely he was not
going .into the Albany like that? No.
ho took another omnibus to Sloane street.
I sitting behind him as before. At Sloane
street we changed again,' and were pres
ently in the long lean artery of the
King's road. I was now all agog to know
our destination, nor was I kept many
more minutes in doubt. Raffles got down.
I followed. He crossed the'road and dis
appeared up a dark turning. I pressed
after him, and was In time to "see his
"coat-tails as he plunged Into a still darker
flagged* alley to the* right. He was hold
ing himself up and stepping cut like a
young 'man once more; also. In some
subtle way, he â¢ already looked less dis
reputable. But I; alone was there to" see
him;, the alley was absolutely deserted
and desperately, dark. At the farther end
; he opened a door with a latch key, and it
'was darker yet , within. :
Instinctively I drew back and heard him
chuckle. -We could no longer see each

"To-morrow night!" I exclaimed. "Why,

And Raffles leaned toward mo with a
dy. slow smile that made the hidden
meaning of his visit only too plain to me
at last.
"So you think of having a try for his
diamonds?"
He shrugged his shoulders.
"It is horribly obvious, I admit Butâ
yes, I have set my heart upon them! To
be quite 'frank, I have had them on my

it a kind of duty to have a go for them;

LONDON was just then talking of
one whose name Is already a name
end nothing more. Reuben Rosen
thall had, made his millions on Git
diamond fields of South Africa, and had
come home to enjoy them according to
his lights; how he went to work will
scarcely be forgotten by any reader of
the half-penny evening papers, which
reveled -in endless anecdotes of his origi
nal Indigence and present prodigality,
varied with Interesting particulars of the
extraordinary establishment which fhe
millionaire set up In St. John's Wood.
Here he kept a retinue of Kaffirs, who
were literally his slaves; and hence ne
would sally, with enormous diamonds in
his shirt and on his fingers. In the convoy
cf a prize fighter of heinous repute, who
was not, however, by any means the
worst element in the Itosenthall menage.
60 said common gossip, but the fact was
sufficiently established by the interfer
ence of the police on at least one occa
sion, followed by certain magisterial pro
ceedings which were reported with justi
fiable gusto and huge headlines in the
newspapers aforesaid. And this was all
one knew of Reuben Rosenthall up to the
time when the Old Bohemian Club, hav
ing fallen on evil days, found it worth fls
while to organize a great dinner in honor
of so wealthy an exponent of the cluCs
principles. I was not at the banquet my
self, but a member took Raffles, who told
me all about It that very night.
"Most extraordinary chow I ever went
to in my life," said he. "As
for the man himself â well, I was
prepared for something grotesque,
but the fellow fairly took my
breath away. To begin with, he's tne
most astounding brute to look at, well
over 6 feet, with a chest like a barrel,
and a great hook nose and the reddest
hair, and whiskers you ever saw. Drank
like a fire engine, but only got drunk
enough to make us a speech that I
wouldn't have missed for ten pounds.
I'm only sorry you weren't there, . too,
Bunny, old chap."
I began to be sorry myself, for Raf
.fles was anything but an excitable person,
and never had I seen him so excited be
fore. Had he been following Rosenthall's
example? His coming to my rooms at
midnight merely to tell me about his din
ner was in itself enough to excuse a sus
picion which was certainly at variance
with my knowledge of A- J. Raffles.
"What did he say?" I inquired me
chanically, divining some subt r explana
tion of this visit and wondering what on
earth it could be.
"Say?" cried Raffles. "What did he not
say! He boasted of his rise, he bragged
of his riches, and he blackguarded society
for taking him up for his money and
dropping him out of sheer pique and jeal
ousy because he had so much. He men
tioned names, too, with the most charm
l ing freedom, and swore he was r.s good a
man as the old country had to showâ pace
the Old Bohemians. To prove it he
pointed to a great diamond in the middle
of his shirt front with a little finger load
ed with another Just like it. "Which of
our bloated princes could show a pair
like that? As a matter of fact they
seemed quite wonderful stones, with a
curious purple gleam to them that must
mean a pot of money. But old Rosen
thall swore he wouldn't take Â£50,000 for
the two, and wanted to know where the
other man was who went about with 25,000
in his Bhirt front and other 23.000 on nis
little finger. He didn't exist. Jf he did.
he wouldn't have the plucn to wear them.
But he hadâ he'd tell us why. And before
you. could say Jack Robinson he had
whipped out a whacking great revolver!"
"Not at the table T"
"At the table! In the middle of his
speech! But it was nothing to what, he
â¢wanted to do. He actually wanted us to
Jet him write his name in bullets orTthe
opposite wall to show us why he wasn't
afraid Â»to go about in all his diamonds!
That brute Purvis the prizeLghter, who
is his paid bu*Â»y, had to bully his master
before he could be persuaded out of it.
There was quite a panic for the moment;
one fellow was saying his prayers under
the table, and the waiters bolted to a
man."

Ruffles Is destined to achlere an

London dawn. I wondered whether l
should ever see another, .and was \u25a0* very
hard on myself for that little expedition
which I had made on my own willful ac
count.
It was between 8 and 9 o'clock in the
evening when we took up our position in
the garden adjoining that of Reuben
Rosenthall; the house itself was shut up,
thanks to the outrageous libertine next:
door. who. by driving away the neigh
bors, had gone far toward delivering him
eclf Into our hands. Practically secure
from surprise on that side, we. could
watch our house under cover of a wall
just high enough to see over, while a fair
margin of shrubs In cither garden af
forded us additional' protection. Thus en-,
trenched, we had stood an honr, watch
ing a pair of lighted bow-windows with
vague shadows flitting continually, across
the blinds, and listening to the drawing
of corks, the clink of glasses and a grad
ual crescendo of coarse > within.
Our luck seemed to have deserted us; tho
owner of the purple diamonds was dining
at home and dining at undue length. I
thought It was a dinner party. Raffles
differed; in the end he â¢ proved right.
Wheels grated In the drive, a carriage
and pair stood at the steps; -there was
.& stampede from the .dining-room, and the
loud voices died away, to burst forth
presently from the porch.
Let we make our position
clear. We were over the wall, at the
side of the house, but a few feet- from the
dining-room windows. On our right, one
"angle of the building cut the back lawn
In two diagonally; on our left another,
angle just permitted us to see the putting,
steps and the waiting carriage. We saw,
Roseuthall come outâ saw the slimmer of,
his diamonds before anything- _Tnen came
the pugilist; then a lady with a head of
hair, like a bath sponge: then another,
and the party was complete. . - - .
, Raffles ducked, and pulled, roe down in.
great excitement.
â¢The ladles are going with them/ he
whispered. "This is great."
"That's better still."
"The Gardenia!" the millionaire had
bawled.
"And that's best of all," eaid Raffles,
standing upright as hoofs and wheels
crunched through the gates and rattled
off at a fine speed. .
"Now what?" I whispered, trembling
with excitement.
"They'll be clearing away. Yes, here
come their shadows. The drawing
room windows open on the lawn. Bun
ny. It's the psychological moment.
Where's that, mask? "
I produced it with a hand whose
trembling I tried In vain to still, and
could have died for Raffles when he |
made no comment on what he could riot
fail to notice. His own hands were firm
and cool as he adjusted ray mask for;
me and then his own. - i
"By Jove. old. boy," ,he whispered
cheerily, "you look about the greatest
ruffian I ever saw! These masks alone
will down a nigger. If we meet one.
But I'm glad I remembered to tell you
not to shave. You'll pass for White
chapel if the worst comes to the worst I
and you don't forget to talk the lingo.

sure of It, and leave the dialogue to

"Quite."

Hunger can be overcome by the hu
man will. By refusing to allow the
mind to dwell upon' gastronomic sub
jects one may repress the tendency to
gastric secretions and banish all
thoughts of eating, say high medical
authorities. â¢
The "posthumous notations" of An
tonio Vitebla, a Corslcan lawyer, who.
In the year 1821. was sentenced to death
for some political reasons, furnish some
valuable arguments in favor of Â£his
view. In order to escape death on the
scaffold, for which he had aversion, he
resorted to death" by. starvation, and
while awaiting a slowly â¢ approaching
dissolution took notes of the rise and
fall of the feelings coursing through
his consciousness.
On the third day of his death fast the
sensation of hunger disappeared. His
head was clear, his thoughts sharp and
lucid, and his eyesight extraordinarily
keen. As the days went by he felt the
comings and goings of sensations of
thirst, but not for hunger. His con
sciousness remained alert and rational
to the last. On the. eighteenth day of
his self-imposed starvation, he* died.
Neither thirst nor hunger had seriously
annoyed him and his last moments
were calm and painless.
The calm intelligence and full reali
sation with which Antonio Viterbia ap
proached his fate naturally held his
thoughts and imagination away. from
representations of food. Hence the re
flexes transmitted from the gastric
nerve-endings to the brain failed to
elicit a conscious response. Hence no'
flow of gastric Juice and ' no sensation
of hunger.
The- same physiological principle is
manifested In the behavior of demented
and hysterical persons, '; whose minds
being busy with subjective images of
fright and horror have been found to
starve for weeks without ever making
known any sensation of hunger.
The strength of these arguments
leads to the conviction - that there ' is
a power resident in every individual
enabling him to control and subdue,
more or less, successfully, his morbid
craving for food arid drinks..; The se
cret of breaking a habit; or passion lies

pelling force of hypnotism. . ]'\u25a0.' ;
Perhaps the most receni of these stor
ies is that which recounted the suicide
in this city of Mrs. Denver, who,
according to the account, attributed
her death'to the impelHng'power which
was exercised over her. by a.man' whose
hypnotic glance followed her, across the

could not escaped \u25a0 ;' \u25a0 v
Such, in substance, is the tenor of the
various stories referred to, arid'7with
the exception of cases like that oft Mrs.
Denver, Who was suffering from. delu-!
slonal \u25a0 Insanity, the claim of hypnotic
influence is really used as a cloak under
which the criminal hopes to 'hidevand.
;o escape the penalty of his crimes'.
However, it is these statements writ

â¢ Although the practice of healing dis
ease through hypnotism is not new by
my means, perhaps at no time in the*
Siistory of this science has It been more
nvestigated or made use of as
therapeutic agent by reputable medical
nen than in the present-day. But al
:hough used to a large extent' by phy
sicians to-day, it is still regarded by
people generally as some, supernatural

idea If possible-and place in -its right
ful position the subject ' of hypno-ther
ipeutlcs that this article is writ\en.
\u25a0 First, the word "hypnotism," which
jonjures divers frightful conditions in

jeneric terrii ; to embrace all kinds of
psychic phenomena, when really It is
i slrnple word derived from the Greek
\u25a0neanlng sleep. " <
. In fact the only difference to be de
ected between the natural sleep in-,

That this is thevcorrect view, of ;the ;

hat in , the majority ; of cases \u25a0 it . is .a ,
tomparatively easy matter. for, a sklll
:ul. operator; to treat the 'patient, my
its normal sleep, . gently passing him ;
ilong- into the suggestible state â¢ with
>ut his awaking.
That this term '/hypnotism is a mis-/
lomer is conceded" by the rriajority;of '
students, Implying" as 1 it does "sleep,"
vhen sleep ; many , times'; is "not ' neces-"
;ary for the successful' treatment of

"To-be" sure, it iis not claimed -that
organic disease jwlHj be cured or de
stroyed tissue replaced by this means,
but.it applies chiefly: to that long line
of functional neuroses from which
three-fourths of ailing humanity suf
fer, "and to the various moral" diseases,
drink . and cigarette, habits, morphine
and. other drug slaveries and divers
moral perverslous which are more pre
valent among the upper classes than
any one not dealing directly .with these
conditions can possibly imagine.
-It - may seem to many a wild state
ment to claim that moral disease un
der; which heading come lying, steal
ing'(kleptomania), as well as physical
perversions can be treated successfully
by; this means and the very character
of .the individuals changed, but" this is
actually what can be. done and what is
being done at the "present time. Dr. J.
D. Quackenbos of New York City, who
is. probably the--greatest authority on
this subject in the country, is now con
fining his work entirely to this class of
individuals, his time being so occupied
with the . regeneration of perverted
character as to preclude his treating
for. therapeutic purposes any longer.,..
Unfortunately the majority of people
have; formed -their entire idea of sug
gestion from the 'vulgar platform ex
hibitions* which are given from time to
time, wherein professional subjects
are made to aef the clown for the en
tertainment of the audience. That this
perversion ' and degradation of a great
power, used for. high purposes,'is.per
mitted, Â» only proves the ignorance of
people generally in", these matters in
this country.

calling them In and giving me in charge
without delay. Rosenthall would not hear
of it; He swore that he would shoot man
or woman who left his sight. He had
hadu enough of the police, vHe was -riot
going to have them coming there. to spoU
sport: he was.soing to deal with me in
his own way. With that he dragged me
from all other hands, flung me against a
door, and sent a bullet crashing through
the wood within an inch of my ear.*
â¢ "You drunken fool! It'll be murder!"
shouted Purvis, getting in the way a sec
ond time.
"Wha* do I care? He's armed. Isn't he?
I shot him In self-defense. It'll be a
warning to others. Will you stand aside,
or d'ye want it yourself?"
"You're drunk." said Purvis. ' still be
tween us. "I saw you take a neat tum
blerful since you came In. and It's made
you drunk as a fool. Pull yourself to
gether, old man. You ain't a-going to do
what, you'll be sorry for." *.; ~Â«|
"Then I won't shoot at him, I'll only
shoot roun' an 1 roun' the beggar. You're
quite right, ole feller. Wouldn't hurt him.
Great mishtake. Roun' an' roun'. There
âlike that!"
His freckled paw shot up over Purvis'
shoulder, mauve lightning came from his
ring, a red flash from his revolver, and
shrieks from the women as the reverbera
tions died away. Some splinters lodged
In my hair.
Next instant the prizefighter disarmed
him; and I was safe from the devil, but
finally doomed to the deep sea. A police
man was in our midst. He had entered
through the drawing-room window; he was
an officer of few word 3 and creditable
promptitude. In a twinkling he had the
handcuffs, on my wrists, while the pugi
list explained the situation. A fine watch
they kept; a lot of good they did; coming
In. when all was; over and the whole
househoM might have been murdered in
their sleep. The officer only deigned to
notice him as he marched* me off.
."We know all about you. sir." said he
contemptuously, and he refused the sov
ereign Purvis offered. "You will Tie see-
Ing me again, sir, at Jlarylebone."
"Shall I come now?"
"As you please, sir. I rather think the
other gentleman requires you more, and
I don't fancy this young man means to
give much trouble." ,
"Oh, I'm coming quietly," I said.
And I went.
In silence we traversed perhaps a
hundred yards. It must have been
midnight. We did not meet a soul. At
last I whispered:
"How on earth did you manage It?"
"Purely by luck." said Raffles. "I
had the luck to get clear away through
knowing every brick of those back
garden walls, and the double luck to
have these togs with the rest over at
Chelsea. . The helmet is one of a col
lection I made up at Oxford; here it
goes' over this wall, and we'd better
carry the coat and belt before we meet
a real officer. I got them once for a
fancy , ballâ ostensibly â and thereby
hangs a yarn. I always, thought they
might come in. useful a second time.
My chief crux to-night was getting rid
of the hansom that brought me back.
I sent him- off to Scotland Yard with
ten bob and a special message to good
old Mackenzie.' The whole detective
dÂ«-â rtment will be at Rosenthall'3 in
about half an hour. Of course, I spec
ulated on our gentleman's hatred of
the police â another huge slice of luck.
If you'd got away, well and good; 1"
not. I felt he was the man to pks^ with
the mouse as long as possible.! Yes.
Bunny, it's, been more of a costume piece
than I intended, and we've come out of
it -with a good deal les3 credit. But.
by Jove, we're jolly lucky to have come
out of it at all!"
The controversy as to whether nuts are a
more perfect food than meat goes on
merrily. Many persons have substi
tuted nuts for meat and been greatly
benefited. On- the other hand, with
other people, the change has brought
about aggravated forms of dyspepsia.
This may. have been partly due to the
fact that the nuts were hastily masti
cated, but the fact still remained that
the more concentratedâ food could not
be digested. I do not think it wise for
any one, to made a radical change in
the diet, for it is a shock to most sys
tems. . If you are inclined to try . the
nut diet, begin by eating a half-dozen
English walnuts with a bit of salt on
each, masticating "slowly and thor
oughly. At the same -time reduce the
quantity of meat which you are in the
habit of consuming. If, after several
days of the nut diet, no ill effects are
noticed, increase the quantity of nuts
a"nd decrease the quantity of meat un
til'the latter has been eliminated from
the menu entirely. The exact quan
tity, of nuts to.be consumed at each
meal must be determined by the indl
vidual, as much depends upon physl-*
cal condition, occupation, etc. Athletic
women can, of course,' consume more
concentrated foods than those of sed
entary habits, although even they
should never. Â«xc<Â»ed a reasonable quan
tity ,in the hope of increasing bodily
vigor'proportionately, for the very ob
ject sought would ' be defeated by di
gestive disturbances."' It is generally
considered that two ounces of nut meat
is about the limit for luncheon or din
ner. Nuts should be purchased in small
quantities, for they become tasteless
and dry in a short time, and are also
affected by damp weather. Buy only
the : plain : nut meats; salted ones are
palatable only whfcn fresh.
Just a general â¢ note of warning here.
This is an age of health fads, and while
I admit that there is plenty of. room
for ref orm in the methods of living,
and especially of eating, among Amer
icans, any change should be brought
about " gradually, and the food in each
case suited to the individual. Because
Mrs. Jones thrives on cold foods don't
think "you ought : to as "welL Try.lt, .if
you .will, but if the plan disagrees with
you. drop it at once: X

Hunger and
Your MindfTHE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY^ CAHT
OKE evening while old Llmuel was
entertaining a party of friends
at the Jucklin homestead the
darkey woman who for more
than a generation had baked the fam
ily corn bread came In and whispered
to Mrs. Jucklin.
"The good-for-nothing," said the
mistress of the house. "Why on earth
doesn't he go to work? Ltmuel. that
triflln' Bill Soniers ' want* a side of
bacon."
"Well, let him have It," said the old
man.
"But he's no account on the face of
the earth." she persisted; and the old
man agreed that with this statement
she had swept the field clear of argu
ment. Then he added, speaking to the
negress: "Give him a mlddlln' of meat
âone big enough to founder him, and
niebbe hell let me alone for a while."
The woman went out. and Limuel ex
plained that Bill Somers was a fiddler
from over the creek. "And," said he,
"I don't know of anybody that is much
less account from the industrial point
of view than the country fiddler. He
spends the most of his time in
neslectin* the things he ought to do.
Everybody sneers at him, and yet the
neighborhood couldn't get along with
out him. Without him there couldn't
be any dancln'."
The young: preacher was present. He
gighed â an art which he gave promise
of carrying to a high state of develop
ment. The girls said that his sigh was
so sweetly melancholy. The old man
allowed that it showed depth. To the
old women it called up the memories
of trouble, and was therefore a vir
tue. So the young man sighed and said
that while X was far from him to
condemn any man, yet he thought that
the fiddle was -a. jack-o'-lantern that
had led many a soul to perdition.
â¢"Dancing:, Brother Jucklin, has \u25a0 never
benefited a community."
"That ma 7 be true," Llmuel ad
milted, "but music benefits man," and
man dances because it Is a sort "of
body-music The most of the folk 3
that dance are light-weight, I must ac
knowledge, but they act out the music
and It Is from this source that they
pet. their enjoyment. In one of the old
books I bought at a sale not long ago
I read this: 'Every human feelin' is
greater and larger than the excltin'
cavEe â a proof that man is designed
for a higher state of existence; and
this is deeply implied. In music.,- In
which there is always somethin' more
and beyond the immediate expression.'
All nature struggles to express music
â the thunder of the heavens Is a
musicâ the elngln' of a bird and the
chirrup of a cricket. Man sings, and
he made such a bad Job of It as a gen
eral thing that he had to call in other
means to get his emotion out of -.him,
so he Invented instruments, the fiddle
bein' the chief among them. It Is a
singular thing that while nearly every
body likes to hear a fiddle well played,
but few people are willln' to admit
that the fiddler Is any account. It would
make no difference how much money a
feller might earn with his fiddle, the
American, especially in the country,
would look on it with a sort of smile.
It wouldn't look like ths money was
as honestly earned as If the feller had
dug up stumps for it But I don't
think, parson, that music leads souls
to perdition. I don't see why it should.
Now David stood pretty well with the
Lord, didn't he?"
"Oh/ yes," the minister answered.
"He was anointed."
"Well, David liked music and it was
noised about, from what I can infer,
that be danced."
"Ah, but It was a different sort of
dance," the preacher objected.
"Yes," said old Llm, "mebbe it was, for
fashions In dancln' change as time goes
on. But epeakln* of the fiddler. I think
that In his way he serves the Lord as
well as anybody. The movement of music
within him ' shows that his soul ain't
stagnant. Over In the Bald Knob neigh
borhood there used to be a fiddler named
Josh Norrls. An acquaintance caught
him lyin' in bed one mornin' after j the
sun was up, and of course that branded
him as bein' no account whatver. But
he vas good ' lookin'. had curly hair,
and one of the comellest* girls In the com
munity became his wife. It appeared to
be a love match. She said that all the
happiness she desired was to sit down
and have Josh play for her. And this
\u25a0was exactly what Josh did. Theweddln*
could be eaten; and \u25a0. when . they were \ all
devoured the young wlf e ; : hinted that
Josh ought to ' look around for; somethln'
to' do. About that time he broke a fiddle
string, and he walked : five miles to get
another; Ibut , the r next' day ; it ; was, too hot
for] him to do any work, so ' he sat 'down
and ' s fiddled;^ It^ did â¢ begin to" look like he

ciated this and Â»"was crowned queen of
beauty. A storm of doubt and criticism
raged around the Madonna head of Cleo
de Merode because her favorite coiffure
concealed her ears. ; Ears count in the

hotly about the hidden Merode, ears. One
faction declared they were monstrosities
and best , hidden. \u25a0', Another facetiously
whispered that they were mutilatedâthat
some one had wickedly hipped a bite out
of one; that perhaps a jealous rival had :
silt them. It was even darkly hinted that
there were no ears at all. And at last, in'
sheer self-defense, the lovely Merode had
to uncover them to prove there was no

La Jolie that the momentary danger is
over, "yes, it is the procesS I want to

to go on the stage because- I was stags

that I was being paid. for my looksâ
that that was what counted; so I've had
to live up to that. It's like having a
reputation for. anything else â you cave
to keep it up. ;
"I have to take care of my looks, of
course, and pay a \u25a0 good "deal of â¢atten

that's not hard. That's a pleasure to

WHAT is a prize beauty?
Who should be better able
to tell me than La Jolie Tit
comb herself â La Jolie Tit
comb. who proclaims her fatal gift
in her stage name, who is heralded
by the paragraphs of the press agent,
\u25a0who is placarded on the walls, who is
lithographed in colors in the show win
dows, who is announced on the pro
grammes asa prize beauty; nay, more,
r.ot merely as a prize beauty, but as a
triple prize beauty.
Surely I have come to the riglit shop,
for information.
So 1 ask her. 1 j>ut the question
straight to the prize beauty herself.
Am I blunt, brusque, tactless?
A sudden doubt of myself assails me.
I feel a. little uncertain of myself, a
little like those simple, well ititcntionca
souls ue see at the art exhibitions
peerine* sÂ«-arching>7 and vainly into
the gold-fjaiiii d canvases for th^
chiaroscuro they bear the initiated talk
about so jiliUly.
Perhaps, 1 s;iy to myself, the ques
tion should be superfluous. Perhaps
the answer is obvious.
From the fiecling look of surprise,
followed by suspicion and then indul-
Kciit pity in the big. bold, laughing

er that s-he thinks so herself â that in
her opinion the answer is to be found
on I lie outside, not extracted from the
bKOdj* of ...La Joliii Titcomb.
But â tkvvc arc so many kinds of
licauiy, such various tastes to be sat
isfied utid standards to be met. even
here in iSa.ii Francisco. 1 remember
how the critics have differed even
about La Jolie, who wears the triple
crown. Some of them, heartless rascalJ.
have hooted at the hallmarks of Paris
and of. St. Petersburg, aye, and of
Buenos Ayres, that stamp the pulchri
tude of La Jolie Titcomb as the real
thing, and have declared her curves
too feather- beddy for Sun Francisco's
exacting standard, her chins too many,
'"What, after all, docs that count
for?" La Jolie herself says, with a to'^s
of her head and a shrug of her statu
esque fchoulders. "It is only personal
opinion â they are welcome to it. And
Ean Francisco â pouf! Sail Francisco
is not Paris, nor ist. Petersburg; nor
yet Buenos Aynes! What do I care for
the opinions of the critics of San Fran
cisco, which is so far away fro:n Paris
*nd St. Petersburg â and Buenos Ayres?
and anyway the Orpheum audiences,
the people who pay, have liked me!"
The possibility of a difference of
opinion is admitted and. after all, I am
seeking information, specific, exact, de
tailed information, so I take heart and
repeat:
* "What is a prise beauty?" f
We are in La. Jolie Titcomb's dress

pleasant, roomy "star" dressing-room
adjacent to the stage, and from the
tu.se there floats to us the touching
plaint that
Nobody knows her number.
Tou may say what you like about
genius and talent and all tbat sort o!
thing, but it's beauty In a woman that
counts for most. It's beauty that gets
everything. And It's beauty that every,
woman wants before anything else.
"When a woman gets a reputation as
a beauty, where she Is an actress and
wins a beauty prize, as in my case. It
increases her salary. Managers pay,
herÂ»more, for they know they can xnaka
more out of her. People will coins to
see her just out of curiosity and to
form their own opinion of her beauty.
"Everybody wants to meet Herâ she
gets a great deal of attention, with all
that that means In presents and flower*
and entertainment and all that sort of
or course, she may not really,
be a beauty, and even If she is every
one will not agree that ana Is Â«
beauty â I am not* altogether satisfied
with myself, I pick myself to pieces
and say. this feature is not good and
that one could be a little better. I
think that perhaps my nose is a llttlÂ«
too large â but so long as other peopla
think she is a beauty, so long as sh*
has the reputation .
"Well, It's worth a good deal. It
-means everything to a womanâespe
cially on the stage."
"It means "
"Well, for example. In St. Peters

queen of : her gray, world. . for whom mil
lionaires outbid each other, sits expectant
under the -crimson shaded lights of the
Moulin Rouge, holding out her hands for
the favor of Paris just once more, and
Paris studies her critically and finds her
grown passe,' " '.'not so well kept as she
used to* be," and turns her the cold
shoulder and puts the golden apple in the
hands of the glowing, exuberant Titcomb,
the American Titcomb, and christens her
â¢*La Jolie."
-Yes, it rs sad to come to that," muses
La Jolie Titcomb. a little pensively, "but
It's to be expected. All the beauties grow
old and fade â and get put on the shelf.
One," and "she signs and dismisses the
horrid thought with â¢ a shrug of the
shoulder. "As for me, it will come, too,
but"â taking another look in the mirror
for comfortâ "it's a long way off yet, I
hope.
* "I had appeared at the Folles-Ber

me. and I have plenty of friends in
Paris, and I guess the public liked me,

most votes and I won the prize of

counts for a gotxl deal â in Paris!"

and that was the last of King Oram the Ninetieth!
When Davy darted through the little door he
four.d himself in the main hall, where was gathered
a host of the palace inmates shiveriirg in terror, for
that yell was merely the last one of many others
that .. had always .; followed â¢ the entrance into that
fatal room. of one of theVsuitors-bf the beautiful
Prihcess.-^- T /'- : ----iz.-.'~*c.. ..".:' ;'!.'-: -..; â¢-'\u25a0\u25a0
When Davy told them that the King had been
swallowed by his pet they, all shouted with joy, and
instantly called for Cinnabeir When, she appeared
they said that the good King Oram, her dearly-be
i loved father, had left without any parting message,
and, very likely, would never come back â for they
didn't want to hurt her feelings â and that now aha
was Queen of Oquimba.
"But is this legal?" she demanded. "Wito^ can
prove that my, father has but gone on a short jour
ney and that he may not return at any moment ?"
"I can swear that he went on a short journey, all
right!" declared Davy. "The trip was perhaps only
a few yards in length, but it's a cinch that no will
stay there, for he simply can't come backt"
Then, to make sure, he took out his maaio glass
and looked. Sure enough, the King was packed
away inside of the great Thing, which was lying
down in its room with a horrid grin on its face. Sa
he added : . .
"Yes, the 'King, your dear father, is gone f<ra
good, and he wouldn't be a nice sight if 1Â» did- coma
back nowl"
Then the Princess said:
"Then lam free : to tell a great secret. I aan not
his daughter, at all, but he stole me when a littk
baby from my mother, the Queen of North Polaris,
a land far away and unknown to any but certain
travelers who, like the King, venture far into
strange regions. He has often told me that my
parents still mourn for me, and hope to recover me.
and before I take the crown I wish to find them ana
tell them that I am alive."
Davy cried eagerly:
"Permit me to conduct you to them! I know ex*
actly where they are, and we can get there ta less
than two weeks!" - â¢ ,
"I. am afraid it -wouldn't be proper for me to
travel with a young man unless he wero my Ima
band," replied the Princess, blushing.
"Oh, that's easy!" said Davy. "Lef s get married
at once, -and then people can't talk !"
"That certainly would be quite the correct tMngj
and, besides, we would then have an up^to-data
king as well as a queen !" said the Court Chamber
lain ; and as everybody followed every suggestion of
the Court Chamberlain, a great shout of joy went
up from the multitude of people who' had gathered
on hearing that the/ mean, cruel old King had been
swallowed by the' Thing, and then Davy saidt
**Â£
The King turned pale, and then, laughing, he
said: *
''Come! Speak up and say what you think I"
--"Inthat costly box are three pieces of stale bread,
two frankfurter sausages, an old woolen sock and
a bit of leather, that is part of a harness!" replied
Davy, with decision, looking the King in the eye.
The King jumped about four feet into the air, and
"Somebody must have told you! Or else you axÂ©
**The question now is, am I right ?" demanded
Davy. "Are those thing 3 in the box, or are they,
noti" > , '
"You have guessed rightly. Now/ what's in the
next room, beyond v that brazen door?" asked the
monarch, trying, as 1 he spoke, to 'edge toward his
little door to escape, but Davy had placed himself
before that door as soon as he entered the room,
and he got closer to it now. The King spoke in a
nervous manner, and said:
"I'll allow you to examine that brazen door if you
like, so that perhaps you may guess easier."
Now Davy knew well' that the electrio button
which opened the big brass door wa3 in the wall
near the small exit, and he laid his hand on it as
lie replied :
"No, I can guess without leaving this spot. I don't
know the name of your pet beast, but FlI ahow him
to you!" f:/'Z"
Then he pressed the button, and as the brazen
door flew open he slipped through the tiny, door,
which opened at the same moment.
. Every time he spied a freshly-fallen mass of
gravel he hastened to it, and it was not often that
he failed to find a treasure hidden there. In time
the professors from the colleges, who fairly haunt
ed that locality, came to look for him and depend
on him for supplies, and in the college museums
were many tilings marked with Davy Brown's name
as the original discoverer, which he had presented
to the museums. â¢
One summer afternoon he" struck a new spot,
one that he : had never explored, where immense
trees overhung a high-banked creek, and among the
gnarled roots of a fallen tree â¢ he. spied something
that reflected the sunshine with a strange, greenish
gleam. It was, half burtSd in the sand, but his keen,
practiced eye instantly detected that it was stono
and dpe of the ancient relics.'
When he had lifted it from its"' gravelly bed ; he
was delighted to find that he had discovered some
thing entirely new and strange, . a stone/ object the
like of which nobody had ever before seen; for, of
course, Davy now knew just about what had been
found previously, because the prof essors had given
him many books on the subject of Stone Age imple
ments.' . - f \ '\u25a0 â¢; '. â¢ . r
The thing whi^h he had found was made of a dull
green flinty /stone,' shaped like a heart,' with a'sur
face dull but smooth; and when Davy had removed
the clinging earth from it he saw that a ? email
round hole had been bored/ through it Iso that it !
might be suspended, lijje a locket, about \tha Beci
of its wearer.

"Dats a pestle, f o' sure !" exclaimed Uncle Mose.
"Dats what dem Stone Age men used ter grind der
corn in a big hollow rock! I'll bet you could git a
half dollar for dat if one of dem purfessors was
'roun' heahT'
"But why did they take so much trouble, those
Stone Age men?" demanded the boy. "Why didn't
they take their corn to the mill and have it
ground V
"How you talk! Don't you know dey didn't have
no mill nor nothin' in dem times?" replied Mose.
"Dey jist naturally had to do everything by hand."
"How long ago was that time?" asked Davy.
"Long before all dat gravel and sand came to be
piled on to de earth I" said Uncle Mose. "P'raps
thirty/ mebbe a hundred thousand years ago."
"How do you know that?" asked the boy.
"'Cause we find dem stone things down beneath
the gravel and sand. De purfessors say dat long
'bout de Caloric Age, or some sich time, down came,
slam bang, sping! all dat gravel a-whirlin' and a
twirlin' and buried up everything in eight â trees,
men, anamiles and all! Fust timo I hear 'bout iÂ£
t'vras good while sence, and dey says dat it all hap
pen in what dey call de Ice Age, and den dey say
de ice done bring all dat sand, clay and gravel here ;
but lately dem purfessors dey say it's impossible for
any ice to make all dat stuff; and, besides dat,
where's de ice to git all dat stuff from, anyway?"
"Well, then, where did it come from ?" demanded
Davy.
"Dey says a comet just hauled off j and slapped
it all on de face of de earth, and den went spinning
away again! Beckon dats right, 'cause all dat sand
and clay am jist mussed up in spots j like de wind
swept it 'roun' and 'roun' like a snowdrift. .And
down at the bottom, underneath the hardest and de
toughest part, lays dem stone knives and axes and
co on."
"Well, anyhow, even if the ice brbught it, all
these things must be mighty old," ventured the boy.
"Betcher life !" exclaimed Uncle Mose. "I reckon
dem was de times o' witche3 and hobgoblins I ' Why,
dey had anamiles 'bout as big as railroad trains a
wanderin' 'round de earth seeking who dey. might
devour, 'case some of deir skelingrtons has .been
found, and in 'em, sticking to deir ribs, am arrows
end epears!"
"Gee whizl" exclaimed Davy. "I wish I'd been
alive then!"
"You wouldn't a' been a mouthful to one of dem
taxidermusses, or dem alabasteroziums !" replied
the old man. "I 6een de head of what dey call a'
6quinnusotherium, and it was bigger dan your pa's
wagon body!"
Xow Uncle Mose, as your father will tell you, did
not really name these ancient animals correctly, but
it made no difference to Davy, who listened in won
der and awe, after which he searched more eagerly
for relics of the past and found many, which he sold
to collectors for good sums. Along the sloping
banks of the river and up the narrow creeks that
flowed into it he roamed daily, with keen eyes that
rarely missed the gleam of a white quartz arrow
head, the rough end of a spearhead or some other
ancient implement. '
DAVY BKOWl!^ and Uncle Hose were great
friends. Uncle Mose was an old colored
man who by profession was a "kalsomine
artist," as he called it, but he was known to all his
neighbors as a "whitewashes" He was old, far
older than anybody else in Watertown, and very,
very wise, of course, as was quite natural in one of
his age. That he was fond of a little boy might be
considered odd, but it often happens that an aged
man becomes attached to a youngster, and these
two certainly were great friends.
Uncle Mose lived right by the riverside and he
owned a boat in which Davy spent many a happy
hour. The banks of the river were high of a
sandy, gravelly soil, in which men of science came
very often to dig for those objects of stone â hatch
ets, arrowheads and the like^ â which are scattered
all over our lasd, but nowhere so plentifully as on
the banks of this river. As far back as Davy could
recollect he had seen Uncle Mose assisting these
scientific visitors with shovel and pick, but he never
realized how much Uncle Mose knew about these
things until he was quite a big boy and had begun
to find arrowheads and such things for himself.
One day he picked up a long straight club
shaped article, very carefully polished, in a spot
where the river bank had fallen recently, and he
hastened to Uncle Mose to learn what it was, for
he had never seen such an instrument, although
now he was quite familiar with many of the cb
fects discovered in the gravel.

"Ah, but no such beauties as the Princess Cinna

Oijuimba. "She/ is said to be fairer than the day t
/If am] sure that you will feel sorry to have missed

* ."I- guess she's no prettier than my sister Molly I"
said Dayy.*

it certainly seemed so, and he followed
the Kinginto the palace; but as he started to do so
he saw 4 the beautiful Prince 63 show her face at the

\u25a0: /'Good morning, my young friend.' I suppose you

"Oh, I. am riot so fond of looking 1 at girls, wheth

money !" replied Davy, laughing. "Girls are plenty
enough in our town, I assure you!"- v *â¢ .
*He;caught'the gleam of Cinnabel's eyes *t. the
window as ho spoke, and he was quite sure that she
heard himV * * ' ~r\\- '" *â¢-â¢ ' "
Next: day .he walked about the public gardens of
the palace and yet made no attempt to enter, but
peering into his magic emerald he saw that the Prin
cess was watching him from behind the window
curtains with' much interest. On the following
morning he" again appeared in the garden, and this
time the King came forth and said:.
Â«Â«Â£

A ake th'b risk /of guessing/ as ho was a poor guesser.
But'aftcf a time ho tried to hazard what was in the

declared that the Princess herself stood behind. the
brazen r cloor. â¢â / '. // /: ./- ; /
* When he had uttered the words the -door ' flew
open^and intotheroom flew an awful (Thing !" It
was as, big as an elephant, all hairy ! and spiky. like
a big chestnut burr, with long' claws and horns, and
eyes like fire. It rushed at the young man, and as it
did so the King slipped out "through: a tiny little
door concealed in the wall and escaped- The, Thing
swallowed : the- poor young man . so suddenly that
Davy scarcely saw how it was donje; and then, after
sniflxng at the tiny door, it went back into the phice
from whence it earned Then i the door closed and.
the King "appeared, grinning, and he took the bags
of gold which the ill-fated young man had laid on
the table snd /went away laughing. Davy's blood
boiled in bis veins; and he resolved to punish this
happening. -The Kins had told the young -man that
if lio gave 'him two hundred thousand dollars and
guessed/first, what .was in a- certain ebony boxÂ» and
tl\en,what was behind a'certain brass/door, he might
aslc .the Princess to,.wed . Km, but ; that ; was ; alL- .. -
-At first he experimented only with simple things,
Buch.as looking down the well or through.tho thich
ness of an oak tree or, -into a. roclv. r Then 'he went
farther, and saw by,its magic where things wefo
lost and what people were doing afar off.. Thus,
without leaving 'his own room, hÂ« could see a play
in the theatre or witness the performance in a cir
cus, although, of cpurse, he could hear/nothing jot
all of what was said. As, to fires, it 'was possible to
see a half dozen at once if he wished, and prize
fights, football games, boat races and baseball were
continual sources of fun.
He used to spy into all sorts of things at first, de
tecting all manper of -wonderful happenings; he
knew just what * everybody carried in his pockets,
and he could fe'ad anybody's/ letters in the/ post of
fice if he wished. Thus! he ; knew /where Uncle Amos
spent his evenings, hdwj much't money.; Mr.-; Barritt

He hastened home with his prize. Doctor Pollard,
the eminent oculist, who was always a famous judge
of diamonds, and. other precious stones, instantly
pronounced the find to be an" emerald /and ; one of
immense value. "Hi, Goldgrabber, :the'.town jeweler,
oifered Davy $18 for it as soon as he saw.it! Judjje
of Davy's surprise when Professor Rankin, â¢ of
Princeton, declared that the emerald heart was
â¢worth fully. $50,000. <
Parting with it was far from his mind, but. as
Goldgrabber said it ought to be polished, Davy be
gan to accomplish* the task in a Japanese manner,
which consists simply in rubbing a stone between
the hands. This is the way they used to give such a
perfect polish to the beautiful "cloisonne ware"
before they learned how to polish with machinery.
Day after day Davy rubbed his prize, noting with
delight that it grew smoother and more shinh.g as
the time passed, although it certainly, taxed the
boy's patience. Finally it glittered like a green sun,
and not a scratchy remained to show what hard usage
it hod passed through during the thousands of years
it had 'lain in the gravel amid pounding rocks and
swirling floods.
2?ow,.boylike, he, had often held the stone heart to
the light, and looked, through its green splendor at
the sun, for it was as clear as crystal throughout
and flawless; but one day he saw. with astonishment
as he peered through it that he was looking clear
thrcMigh the walls of the house and across the fields
beyond ! This was his first intimation that the atbno
had magic qualities. He tested it again to find that
with its aid it. was possible to] see through "all sorts
of substances, \ and then he diÃCOvered-T-although
this happened laterâ that with it one could see any
thing j he wished, the world over 1 J
â¢-Everybody in town at last knew that he, was' able
to detect all hidden, things, and' for a time Davy
was well liked and actually made quite a good in
come by finding lost articles. Thus he discovered
'a lost deed that had been hidden in a wall for
nearly a century, and which gave" Squire "Gelwick3,
when it â¢ was taken to court, /coiiplete possession
of h large tract of land all built up witji handsome
houses and stores; for all this property had once
belonged to his great-grandfather, who had lost'

who at once became a'millionatre^aud who -gave

Each of the party, the weest tot not

has also a shawl strap, the purport
of which will be discovered by and

crew, decided upon weeks ago, is a
secluded grove or shady meadow so
near town that little time is lost in
reaching, it. There must be grass,
and wild noweVs grow in the grass;,
trees and birds and squirrels haunt,
tho branches. Water within easy
distance is an absolute necessity.
Whatever else was left. at home, be
sure a box of fish-hooks and a coil of
twine form a part of each boy's out- .

WHOLESOME ENJOYMENT
AN UNCONVENTIONAL 'FAMILY
Saturday is the most approved
day for family excursions, if the oc
casion ha 3 been foreseen and pro
vided for. If the father be his own
master, he can pack and accommo
date work to leave part of the day
free. The mother can do the same.
The hardest student among the chil
dren has what the much-courted
fopling in "Patience" stipulated for
â"the usual" half -holiday."
family picnic may not commend it
self, unless they are caught young
by the attractions of what I shall
try, to the best ; of my humble abil-'
ity, to set before flat-dweller and
cottager as a delight within tho
reach of' the poor in purse and rea
sonable in desire.
I think sometimes that Benjamin
Franklin was the truest exponent of
the typical American spirit our
country has yet produced. He took
to the strenuous life early. His pro
posed grace over the whole barrel is
a representative anecdote. We
compress our merrymaking into tab
loids and swallow them periodically.
May invites and June wooes in .vain.
Vacation, as a business, has it 3 sea
6on. Rich people can take liberties
with rules, and play when the humor
seizes them. Men and women who
have their living to make cannot in
termit the grind. y
That a holiday once a month, even
if it be classed with uncovenanted
mercies, would make the grind eas
ier, and brace tho back to carry the
burden jauntily, does not enter into
the working man's calculations. â¢: A
Sunday ofi, now find then, ho may

SO SINGS the English poet,
with the scent of the haw
thorn hedges -in 'is im
agination â the stifling, roar
ing town oppressing his senses.
Tho perpetual miracle of spring
time awakens in people who talk,
write and live prose, unuttered long-
Ings for country sounds, country
lights and country smells. As a na
iion we Americana are just learning
to spell vacation, after the Squeers
ian fashion- And when we, too,
"know this out of book, we go and
do it" â or we think we do. To nine
hundred and ninety-seven out *of
every thousand, "Vacation" means
a dead stop in the routine of our
daily living, for one, two, or four
weeks in tie hottest season of the
year, and "going somewhere." If
that daily liviuj be very plain as to
externals and monotonous as to
mental exercises, the "outing" is
probably to the gayest "resort" of
which die pleasure-seeker has any
knowledge. There he or she tarries,
an unconsidered looker-on, as long
as the' money allotted for leisure
holds out. Then â back into harness
for another eleven .months and a
half.'
We take ourselves and all connect
ed with us too seriously. " We set for
ourselves tasks too long and too
heavy. Our Teutonic, Gallic and
Latin immigrants could give us
profitable lesjons in the art of tak
ing duty in broken doses, and di
versifying by breathing spells the
long pulls, the strong pulls and the
pulls all together for which we are
cotcd.

(Copyrighted, 1003, by M. B. de Courcy.)
THE boys crossed to the window
and stood silently looking out
over the ghostly silence of the
great river.
"Frank." said Gray, softly, "that
scene remindsme of an old book in my
father's library; It's a very chamber
of horrors in type â 'Fox's Book of
Martyrs' it is called."
As they stood there the trappings
and of the nineteenth century
seemed to fade into the agony and
chill horror of the darkest days of
Torqucmada â nurse and doctor â the
supposed champion of mercy and ten
der ministration â to resolve Into the
grim outlines of the Judge or " the
Question. Why. â Their indifference
cccxncd even intensified.
'It docs look bad," answered 'Howe,
"but it is a part of our work, a crush
ed, grimy, greasy, and mud-incrustea
railroad victim possesses but little to
appeal to the semi-dramatic point of
view held by doctor and nurse, but the
direct cause of what you have seen
to-night rests upon the railways.
"They furnish a heavy proportion of
the cases coming to these institutions.
The commercial basis enters deeply in
to all their balance sheets; so you have
the contract system. The man who,
with compressed lips and steady hands,
rides down to death for his passengers'
take Is brought here, a thing of broken
bones and quivering nerves, to fall in
to the unwilling hands of the contract
surgeon. In towns like this he is usu
ally a man whose professional stand
ing is low, cither from incompetency
or personal disqualifications; one who
is glad to render surgical services at
about one-quarter of the private prac
tice rating and the partnership of an
annual pats. The doctor, of course,
looks upon each case as a non-remu
nerative intrusion upon his sfneeure.
The nurse's horizon rims entirely upon
the man of the scalpel, so she uncon
sciously assumes an indifferent air. In
my opinion nothing speaks higher of
wonderful vitality or perfection of
physique than the fact that despite in
attention and. oftencr. gross neglectâ
a few wan. tottering wrecks emerge
from these doors; to curry out into
God's sunshine the nightmare recol
lection of slighting words, of lonely,
feverith nights, or the rasp of neg
lected bandages over exposed, tortured
nerves.
."It's all in the game," he added, a
deepened liffht in the brave eyes.
"Yes. but it's one worth playing to a
finish," rejoined Gray uoftly.
Then as the undertaker, followed by his
elerpy assistant, with noiseless, buzzard
alacrity, drifted through the hall, the
tilence of the last-played forfeit of the
"game"â resting quietly waiting upon the
knees of the godsâ fell as a pall between
thrm.
Finally Howe turned to John, and with
a visible t-ffort resumed his ordinary ban
tering, semi-serious manner.
"John," he said, "I've thought of a new
scheme. 1 think I can work that doctor
to gpt us a pass to Eric. We, of course,
have no claim on the railroad, but they
are always giad to get any evidence of
wrecks out of sight. Lay low and watch
my smoke. When we get to Kric. I don't
think it any use to try to get over the
Lake Shore; it"s the hardest combination
except the Pennsylvania main line in the
United States. There is a. legend that a
rounder once got to the yard limit at
some terminal on an out-going train, but
no man ever had the nerve to relate it
in a twitch-shunting bunk room.
"Now the Anchor Line boats run be
tween there and Chicago make it in five
or six days. We can ship as deck hands
â get transportation, board and lodgingâ
and then when we get to Chicago we
can go to work at once.
"It will be the correct thing for you.
A man hailing from Chicago with any
kind of a record at all never kicks his
toes out against a yardmaster's desk. A
young, quick man with' a good Chicago
reputation of being a first-class 'cutter'
cr 'fielder' never decorates extra lists of
'struck off* boarding house keepers."
"What do you mean by 'cutters* or
'fielders?' " asked John.
"When we get there I'll take you Into
the yards for a day or so. It will be no
trouble to learn then." rejoined Howe, a
trifle grimly.
After an extremely frugal breakfast
the doctor appeared. Howe put up the
"pass talk." To John, who, as bidden,
sat watching his "smoke," he seemed
like a new boy, as in frankly innocent
words he told how they wished to go to
Erie, and. carefully suppressing any ref
erence to railway affairs, told of their
desire to go on the lakes.
The doctor, after patiently extracting
ell the apparent plans of his innocent
patient, promised to "see what he could
do for them." About an hour later a boy
handed Howe a strip of blue paper, who.
after glancing it over, parsed it to John,
with the sly remark, "We are glass
â¢window people now."
John saw that "Frank Howe and one"
were passed to Erie "account surgical de
partment."
Then followed a long ride through Ohio,
to John a wonderful country. The great
wide, fertile A'alley. dotted thick with red
barns and cozy farm houses, or still,
fchady streets of easy- going towns
etretching to unequaled pastures. Be
yond, the dim blue hills gradually shrank
to a new and wilder beauty, to towering
mountains, echo-haunted with perpen
dicular sides bristling In massed hemlock^
their evergreen needles quivering ever
above . the dash and roar of the narrow,
freighted river at their feet-
Then in the nightâ Erie. As they stum
bled along the steep, rough streets John
noticed in both cheek and nostril a
et range, dank odor. {
Howe, in answer to the remark. "How
damp and bad the air. seems," replied:,
"It's the lake wind carrying the har
bor odors."
After an uncomfortable night in a
cheap hotel they Bet out for the docks."' -
Howe singled out one from a number
cf white propellers. V
"Lucky, there is the one we want,"
he exclaimed gleefully. â¢'Old Walsh is
her first mate." , :.\u25a0;".
Passing aboard hÂ» crossed to where*
way bills' ln hand, a loosely built Irish
man was busily checking off the lading
of a string of bouncing truck stevedore
propellers passing In endless procession
before him.
He ; raised a pair of,* kindly blue eyes
to. Howe as the . latter Etood . before him.
Then followed a quick, broken conversa
tion,
Howe returned Â« to Gray saying: - "It's
all - right, they \u25a0, are nearly; f uIL ; Nail
on to a truck.*! â¢\u25a0 In a few minutes they
\u25a0were a part of the army of human
â¢uxts, Units of the perspiring:- onslaught
to . this , car."
Arising, he and Gray proceeaea to Â»
long low car standing near. John noticed
in great white letters on the side P.
X R.
"This.*' said Frank. "i 3 a car from tha
Pennsylvania, coal fields, and is the most
murderous combination ever contrived by
corporate greed. Notice the long six
teen-inch dead blocks faced with boiler
iron: see there, where by the force of
Impact the ' facing has been fractured,
bolt heads protruding an inch and
jagged splinters awaiting like sharks"
teethl When you enter the link tha
blocks are less than four inches apart,
your arm between them to the elbow, ona
of those splinters catches your sleeveâ
and then," Avith the side of hi 3 hand ho
struck John's arm at the elbow.. \u25a0
As a strange' convulsive shudder ran
through the member John replied: "But
surely there is some- way to avoid it. Lota
of men grow old and keep their arms In
tact."
"A very good answer," replied Howe,
"but they do it in this way. This car and
these of the Lehigh Valley and Delaware.
Lackawanna and Western are coupled in
this' manner: You walk with the moving
car, resting your arm over the dead,
block, reach down to the link, enter It by
guess, then with a quick turning of the

through the pitch dark, ahead of the
moving car, depending upon dancing
shadows or a deeper gloom to fix the ex
act fraction of a second to snatch your
hand from the hungry jaws awaiting it
in the hidden blackness. Now, some of
these cars have a hook and a three-link
chain fastened to them, and ' it's easier
then; all you have to do is to raise the
-three link and drop it over the opposing
hook; but then again you have to couple
one of these to a common 'sucker mouth*
âthere is where fine work comes in.
Drifting around the country are probably
a bare dozen of expert . 'three-link
couplers,' of whom -the best is called,
â¢Scranton Pete.* To make these couplings
you rest the* outside of the middle link
in your hand, lay the index finger, along
the first one, and throw it into the draw
head, striking the bottom end of a for
ward cocked pin; always remembering to
have the link stretched when throwing."
"Another thing. Ju.ia," he continued,
"never forget that those drawheacls
are not uniform in height: there is al-
Jtvays danger of thlr overlapping: and
â¢jack-knifing* you." -
"What do you mean by that?"' asked
Gray in' surprise.

It* is quite Important not to wet the
head X too s. often in salt water, ' as it is
It must be remembered that any. one
who is "really a -swimmer can wear* a
bathing suit only one " season. The salt
water will certainly rot the material, and
the swimming stroke will; toy the end of
the" summer/ pretty well \ pull the suit to
pieces, no matter bow strong the material
may be. It Is ' therefore ;; advisable " ; . not
to purchase a very expenslve,Bult,,but to
select a fairly . good ; one. ; pretty, and , be
coming, but with the . idea that the â¢ end
of the season it can be _ thrown : away. "
Pflster, |on I Geary : street/ will I make ; ; to

combination suit, consisting of a pair of

ban to protect Ine hair. The best. cap
for .this purpose is a rubber cap. cov
ered with a silk handkerchief, the ends
of which are brought round >nd .tied
over the forehead. This cap: fits snugly
to the heed and stays on well, and at
the same time it Is pretty and gener-,
ally becoming. There is always some
thing very attractive about a graceful
girl in the act of diving, and it always
excites the attention and admiration of
the beholders. In- .. the \ r '.illustration
given of a girl diving the bu.. that she
wears is made of white alpaca,- with a
sailor cellar of black peau'de sole,. with
girdle to match." It r is- really remark
able'how this material stands the!wa
ter, excelling taffeta -In that respect.
Whole suits are now made of It, but
they are quite expensive.

with the aid of a 'little ingenuity and a
Butterick's pattern. . Taffeta BUits in any
color are always pretty, and they shed
the water well, leaving the- appearance .
of not having been. wet. Perhaps black
is the most serviceable color.- Alpaca Is
another good and strong material for a
bathing suit, but it is hard to sew, and
it is said to be too scratchy to be com
fortable. An alpaca ecu t mv :;-. be made -
very large around the y arms, and^ hi the
sleeves, or the rubbing of the sleeve may
make the arm quite Inflamed and sore/ A (
bathing suit cf f :sllk, which Is popular "
with some people, . seems to me to" be too '
clinging, and when- it 'is wet. it looks \
shapeless and unbecoming. ;- A good many i
women, who would very much enjoy a-j
good plunge in the sea, are unwilling to
put on a bathing suit because they think
they are too stout, and object to wearing
corsets in the water. It seems to me pos
sible, however, tto overcome *' this . objec- "
tlon by wearing a very tight "fitting "corÂ»

In England men and women do not
bathe together at the seashore, and a*
a consequent"* not so much, attention 1Â»
paid to bathing suits as is the custom
in America. English girls arr as a
rule, not such, good' swimmers aa
American girls, but they are plucky *&4

for** they . do thoroughly . and with
great determination.- - -â¢-s;" '\u25a0.'-. Wf' c .-Â»
At almc3t every seaside resort In
America there is generally a gallery
of both sexes who do not avail them
selves of the glorious privileges offered
them, - but who ire content to rang*
themselves on chairs, benches or rocks
to look at the swimmers as they take
their dally plunge, after which their
time is occupied in sitting on verandas
or in the gentle game of croquet. Aa
opportunity to swim always seems to>
' mo to' be so great a privilege that It
were a shame to neglect It Apart from
the enthusiasm and glow with which
one buffets the waves, there is no bet
ter exercise in the world than ' swim
ming. Every muscle In 'the body Is
brought into play and the only caution
in the matter la not to stay in too long.
no matter how great may be the temp*
tation to do so.
Before closing there are on* or two
stples that I wish to describe. Ono of;
these is called the "princess" bathing*
suit. It has a full skirt, with an inverted '
plait in the back, and is fitted at the
waist with darts. Two of them run dowa \u25a0
from the square neck half-way down that
skirt.- On each side of these darts there
are two others running up from the bot
tom of the skirt to the bust. Under eaca
arm also darts run down over the hips.
and there are three more in the back. All -
the darts -are covered with whtta braid,
and they make the suit fit in closely at
the waist. -Unfortunately, the "princess**,
suit â¢ can only be worn by people wit*
very i good figures, and It Is not jat all
adapted either for very stout er for very
thin people. This suit Is particularly* pret
ty when madÂ© of blue mohair. One com
plaint frequently made in regard to mo- i
fcair suits is that they are often crinkle*
and raised In the pressing of the seams,
i * -
THERE are multitudes of people
â¢who preler the' eeaehore rather
than the mountains, and who love
the ocean. It is not. perhaps, as
popular in this climate as it is in
the East, where the cool breezes from the
ocean are eagerly sought, as a great re
lief from the intense heat of the cities.
Boston is particularly favored in Its sea
chore resorts, of which there are a great
many co near the city that the men can
very easily go and come every day. and
enjoy a dip In the ocean in the morning
before going to their business In the city.
I Epent the whole cf last summer at
an exceedingly popular seashore resort
ca the coast of Brittany in France, much
frequented by both French and English
cummer sojourners. The surroundings
were beautiful, the hotel excellent, and
the villas most comfortable, and I passed
& most delightful season there. We had
eplendid walks, delightful boating, both
rowing and sailing, and daily baths. But
the French bathing suits were peculiar,
and very different frpm ours. We do not.
in this country, derive our fashions in
bathing suits from the Parisian modiste.
We devise our own styles, which are
quite different from theirs. French peo
ple, although they love the seashore, are
as a rule, not very good swimmers, cer
tainly nothing like oujr American girls.
The women take their morning
swim, cr ocean dip. at about 11 o'clcock,
when they Issue forth from their bathing
- houses arranged in what seems to us most
extraordinary costumes. They wear a
long bathrobe, reaching to the ground,
which by the way has no pretense of be
lr.g pretty or attractive, and they keep
these elongated and ugly _ robes on until
they are Just resdy to plunge into the
water, when they throw them on the
beach, ready to be put on when they
emerge. In that way, the real bathing
suits are but a short time in the field of
view. These suits will not strike the
American eye as at all pretty. The waist
end skirt arc made Jn one piece, but the
fkirt is very short, way above the knee
in fact, but the trousers are separate
\u25a0from the wnist and are very long. Stock
ings are not worn, as beins: suggestive of
the chorus girU or the ballet dancer. For
mere case in swimming the French suits
are very good, but that after all is only
a part of the attraction of a fine beach
In summer. The French women seem to
xnake their bathing somewhat *perfunc-^
tory, end know nothing of the genuine
love of the beach that American girls
feel, nor do they understand it at all.
What is more common at the seaside
than 10 see our girls baking in the sun
in the warm sand clad in their bathing
dresses? But in France this is consid
ered very immodest and they regard with,
something like horror those bold Ameri
can girls who enjoy lying about in the
sun on the b-ach. Naturally enough un
der such circumstances the bathing cos
tume becomes a thing to be considered
wlth a decided tendency each year to be-
come prettier and mere attractive. The
Illustration shows one that is exceeding
ly pretty, though I regret very much that
the pretty colors do not show in the pho
tograph. The picture Is taken in a sit
ting position and perhaps by following my
description of it its beauty can be real
ized. The suit is made of ecru pongee
with a baby blue silk dot. The neck is
cut square and framed in bands of baby
blue taffeta, the sleeves, girdle and the
bottom of the skirt being: also finished
With a two-inch band of blue taffeta. The
e*p to be worn with this suit should be
either of ecru silk with a blue dot or of
blue silk with a white dot. Black stock
ings should almost always be worn, as
they ysre the most becoming and do not
look loud or vulgar.
An illustration of another very pretty
puit is given. It is also of ecru pongee,
with a little. diamond figure of the tame
shade in it and trimmed in red taffeta. It
Is cut high in the neck and has a red
taffeta collar and a vest that comes to
the b* lt. The sleeves are piped in red. as
are also the yoke and the bottom of the
eklrt. Red stockings are appropriate
and look very well with this suit, al
though black are quite proper to be worn
if preferred. The cap of plain red silk
finishes the costume, and the whole ef
fect of it is striking and pretty.
The picture of the girl on the beach
Ehowe a very simple bathing suit, -but it
Is so \u25a0well fashioned and its lines are to
good that it is certainly a very good
style. It is made of black alpaca, cut
quite low in the neck and buttoned at the
Bide. At each shoulder there is an em
broidered white anchor, and the whole
suit Is stitched In white. The sleeves are
quite short and open, giving entire free
. dam to the arm in swimming. Black
Blockings and white beach shoes make a
part of this costume.
. These chocs are made of canvas, with
Cat.Btraw soles and are very desirable
and comfortable if the beach is at all
â¢ rocky. The hat â which is called a
"beach hat"- â is made of white gossamer
silk with a black polka dot. i.nd is
. splendid for protecting the face from
the sun Â«on the beach either before or
after the Â«wim. The plaited ruffle la
also of white gossamer Bilk, but tho
pattern and the colors on it are Ter-
Elan-: The "beach hat" Is quite a nov
elty "here and it a great convenience,
besides being very pretty. 1. Is par
ticularly" convenient for those who do
not swim, the city girl who goes to the
eeasfaore ostensibly for the bathing, but
in reality for dabbling in the shallow
water and then disporting on the beach,
la these cases a pretty bathing suit Is
the essential thing, and a hat that is
becoming and at the same time protects
the complexion Is very desirable. For
the real swimmer the hat is not
needed, though even for her it is con
venient after the bath. For diving
â¢oca a hat is of course out of the ques-
Uon-'-ehe must cnJy have a cap'or,tur-

Some Queer Ideas of Jobs I~ Wbea
la Redone.
MY first important fight was In
Music Hall. In Boston, on April
6, ISEO, at a benefit given to Joe
Goes, who was champion of
England. I sparred Goss three
rounds, and in the 6*cond round I gave
Mm a clout that almost ended the affair
right there. This was breaking into the
programme, and the managers of the af
fair made a holler that Joe must bÂ«
given time to recover before the bout
went on. On the advice of Billy Edwards
and Tom Denny I made the last round
easy for Joe. not trying to knoclc him
out. Afterward Joe said that my punches
were 'like kicks from a mule."
Joe didn't mean that I was mulish; it
xr*a his way of paying a compliment.
Froni the time of that affair, which was
the first time I met Goss, we became firm
friends. He was a fine old chap, kind and
generous, and he thought so much of me
that the Bports used to guy him about his
admiration for me. He would defend me
from all kinds of grafters, would talk by
the hour to prove that no other fighter
that ever lived was in my class, and up
to the time of his death he stood my
friend in fair weather and foul.
Goss was first attracted, to me after my
meeting with George Rooke of England.
I polished off Rooke at the Howard Athe
naeum In Boston in January, ISSO. I
knocked Rooke out In the second round.
They rang down the curtain when I had
knocked Rooke down seven times, the last
time to stay down,
A Quick job uone jon a Canadian

Joe and I gave a sho.pr in Boston in
January. ISSL We cleaned up $1300 be
tween us. On that occasion I sparred
Jack Stewart, champion of Canada. I
walloped him so hard that he ran off Â»h2
stage In the third round, and he was go-
Ing co fast that he evidently Intended to
reach home that evening.
This Canadian hero had been making a
lot of cracks as to what he Intended to do
to me and he put it so strong that he
had convinced some of my friends that
my time had come. The Impression was
-ell over town that I was to catch It good
and fast, and a big politician came to me
the day of the affair and passed me- a
paper, which I found to be a doctor's
certificate that I wasn't fit to go on that
evening.
You can bet I was well stirred up by
the time to face the Canadian. When
he turned to run eff the stage it made me
so disgusted, after all the rumors he had
set going, that I ran after him and gave
him a kick where his coattails would.have
been had he been wearing a coat. He
got the kick Just as he was disappearing.
I yelled after him. "Why don't you wait
and get the whole of what you ought to
getT* He didn't stop to argue the point.

It's queer the notions people get of
what I do when I am In retirement. A
tall Michigander told me not long ago
that my rubber heels were the best ever.
He thought I was the man that invented
those aids to easy walking. A fellow in
Missouri came to me to advise me to
make my pench not co much of a head
ache producer. When I got him to ex
plain he said he had been made groggy
for three days on four glasses of "Sulli
van's punch."/ which he was told I was
bottling in Boston and making a fortune
out of. I never made any fortune that
way. There are thousands of people. I
suppose, who couldn't be convinced that
I am not the Congressman Sullivan of
Boston, and they are more than sure of it
since Mr. Hearst pitched Into that gen
tleman. A man in St. Louis told me that
he called at my "home" In Washington
three times last winter to see me. and
\u25a0when I tried to convince him that I didn't
live in Washington and wasn't a member
of Congress, he told me that he knew
better. He said he'd take care not to call
again when he was In Washington. That
man Is dead sure now that I saw. him
first in Washington and side-stepped. '

a- man with- o,ooo' in money waa more*
conspicuous than a millionaire Is to-day.
When. the telephone was new It got ltÂ»
first boost. in Boston, and I could haTÂ«
been in on the ground floor for a- sum I
tossed -to the cuckoos every month. A*
big slice was offered to me for not much
money, but that use for money waÂ» toa
slow for me. For $5000 I could have- Â«ot
enough of a street railway stock wnlcl*
to-day would be pulling in a'\u25a0 wad that
would keep me busy, to spend. A fellow
I grew up with begged me with tears la
his "eyes to let him put the profits from
one of icy fights into a' corner lot in tha
heart of Boston, \which was going tor a
song. That lot la now near the nvm
Union Station and earns as much money
every year as Teddy gets for passing thÂ«

The Difference Betweca Kins? Kelly and .
Kmperor Lajote.
What -with firing away his money andj
having fun with Anson, King Kelly had
a merry life, but a short one. He was ai
king, among ball players and. a prince
among spendthrifts. Once he lectured met
on ths wisdom of getting the savings
bank habit. BBftfVtJV
"You'll need tt some day. John I*." ne>
said.
"How about yourself going broke,
Mike?" 111 1 asked.
. "Not- me. -When I need money I can
take my turnout and go selling milk," hÂ»
replied. "
The turnout he referred to was :thÂ«
horse and buggy given to hÂ»m just before
a ball game on: the National League
grounds in Boston. The riff was a pres
ent to the king by his subjects In my
town. . â¢
When King Kelly passed out the future
emperor, Napoleon Lajoie, was driving
an ice cart in Woonsocket. Prosperity al
most carried the Frenchman off his feet,
but the lesson of Mike Kelly and somo
more of, us foolish. ones was drilled -Into
him. IHe .cut out - the redeye and * got . a
bankbook, and to-day he Is king of them
all and 1 setting rich.- He doesn't tntend
to get off the water wagon and go back
to the ice cart. The difference between
King! Kelly -and Emperor Lajoie is the.
dlnerence between- the old style and the
new in all kinds of sport, and the stayer
is the man behind the pledge.
Kelly died early. Lajoie grows better
every s year, and if he were to take up>
boxing he could sprint faster than CorÂ«

The primitive man of to-day uses al

and be is quite as happy as the chap\
who sits down to a â¢ startling array of.
knives, forks and the Lord only. knows

ter of some # three., hundred years since
every man had 'his own' knife . arid it
served all purposes.^.Ayhen he wanted a
piece ' of \u25a0, meat he reached out for the
whole Joint, helped himself bountifully
and then passed It on to his neighbor, who
in turn did likewise. When he wanted a
piece, he cut off as: much as x he thought
could be managed, comfortably and put
it into his mouth with. his free hand.
Even. in. England, none of the sover
eigns had forks until the time of Henry
VII. Every one, whether they were high
or low. used'their lingers. It was for this
reason that all royal households and
houses of the better "class f or v that j mat

'with a se.V-.9f followers, attended the

it it is' extremely doubtful whether she

so slowly that at the middle of the sev
enteenth century they were used. only by
the higher elastics, and then - one ' was
permitted his choice. In 16S8, or - about
yie tlms of the Revolution, few English
men possessed more than a dozen silver
forks, which, by the way, had but two

enough Iron and 6teel ones to serve the

The real collector, and there arc two
distinct and separate kinds, does not hes
itate to flatter, to lie. to steal; to bor
row, to beg or to buy. Anything ana
everything. Is perfectly legitimate when
one is china hunting and when the trail
is getting hot nothing short of a merry
row will convince him that his time and
his purse are as naught and that for
unce in his life he has bumped up against
gome one who has a mind and a will or
his own. ; ;.
The other collector Is the modest soul
who does not profess to know all about
the thousand. and one eomposltlqns and
who cares little about the glaze and the
color. There la no learned talk about th'o
paste and the various marks, but in
stead there is the love of the old and the
quaint and nothing Is too simple or too
common if it but savors of bygone days.

Chinese vessel sailiziif by,
Wiping willow hangim o'er.
f Bridge with threÂ« men. it not four.
Chinese temple there If ttands.
Seems to cover all thÂ« lend.
Apple trees with appl*Â« en. -j â¢
A pretty fence to end my "Â°P*.SiÂ§yijÂ§
To be bure, it is called the dciplscd of
adl wares, but only by collectors, mind
you, and such would not be the case If
almost every family under the shining
Â»un <x>uld nut produce a piece on an in
stant's notice. *
But, be that aÂ» it may, the fact still
remains 'that -when â¢luncheon, sets are
chosen just about nine out of every ten
persons, go In the back door of the shop
and with \u25a0 apologies ,and. excuses finally.
V select the homely willow, whose true blue
makes such a good showing against the
background of white.
And, speaking of this Chinese ware re
minds* me that It is not such an uncom
mon thing these days to see chop sticks
laid side by side "two pigeons flying
high," though, of course, it is more for
the novelty of the thing than anything
rise, and especially since chop Â§uey has
been so extensively served at American
* tables.
And why do we laugh at the Chinese
using chop 'ticks anyway ? Probably for
the pimple reason that we have forgotten
the fact that bur own knives and forks
y"y HINA collecting, the most fascinat
/ / ing of all faddy pastimes, has come
W} to the fore again and every woman
\^ who takes up a hobby and rides it
for all it Is worth is indulging herself to
the -limit. In fact, she is doing a little
more than that, for she is not only pay
ing fabulous prices for the rare old china
that is becoming more and more elusive,
but she Is? planning and scheminj as well
lo get hoid of It by hook or crook, and
she eases her conscience by telling her
self that her. precious gains are nothing
more cr less than the spoils of war.
It is rather laughable when one stops
to think about it. There was a time, and
not po long gone by either, when any one
of us visited our country relations and
Inwardly criticized every cup and dish
that they so hospitably placed before us.
' There were queer old-fashioned shapes
and patterns too outlandishly gaudy to be
used on any respectable .table, and whan a

The fate which Prince Muhammed
Reshad escaped has _ now - overtaken
Prince Ahmed ; Kemal Eddin. ;The
Prince's untimely end was due primar
ily to the fact that he had exclted-the
enmity, of Febin Pasha, the chief of. the
palace police,, who are entrusted* with
the protection . of - the . Sultan at Yildiz
Kiosk. Fehin Pasha is thus oneof the
moat powerful personages In Turkey,*
and he has exploited his opportunities
with relentless ', cruelty. The- enmity
which hÂ« has excited . among v ; other,

TROUBLE OVKRA WOMAN. >
CONSTANTINOPLE. June 10.âRe
cently an official announcement was is
sued to the effect that the Sultan's
brother. Prince Ahmed Kemal Eddin,
was dead and buried. This announce
ment caused considerable surprise be
cause no one in the Turkish capital,
even In the court circles, had the. least
idea that Prince Ahmed, Kemal Eddin
was suffering from any 'malady.' The
news of his illness, death and burial
came simultaneously and .gave .rise to
legitimate suspicions regarding .the
whole affair, and although most persons
\u25a0who are acquainted with the methods
of the Turkish court felt sure what, had
happened, it has taken some time for
the truth to filter through the court cir
cles and come to the knowledge of the
outside world. Prince Ahmed Kemal
Eddin did not die a natural death, but
was murdered, and there are , good
grounds for believing that he was
strangled by order of his imperial
brother, the Sultan Abdul Hamld of
Turkey.
Since the murder of King Alexander
of Servla, which took place In June,
1903, the Sultan of Turkey's fear of as
sassination has become a' perfect mania.
On a recent occasion the Sultan, Ab
dul Hamid, suddenly conceived the idea
that his brother and heir-apparent,
Prince Muhammed Reshad, was con
spiring to kill him and to take posses
sion of the throne. The Prince. was im
mediately arrested and s thrust Into a
dungeon within the walls of * Yildiz
Kiosk..
LONDON, June . W.â Mrs. Frank Mac
key, Jt is something more than whis
pered in the smart set, is ambitious to
occupy the place in society here that has
long been filled by the other and much
older American woman whose name so
closely resembles her ownâ Airs. J. W.
Mackay. The widow of the Silver King
Is not going to step aside for the brilliant
Chicago woman xvithout a struggle. It <s
etrongly hinted that this is the main rea
ecn why she Intends giving some enter
tainments at her magnificent residence in
Carlton House terrace this season which
will recall her best efforts when she
reigned undisputed over the American col
ony.
Mrs. Frank Mackey has for some time
rejoiced in the possession of a motor car,
â¢which Is acknowledged, to be the most
luxurious, gorgeous and costly vehicle of
its kind In London. It attracts more at
tention than any other conveyance at the
fashionable afternoon parades In Hyde
Park. But It is said it will soon be
eclipsed by a motor car â¢which Mrs. J. W.
Mar.kay has ordered from France and
which will represent everything .hat is
latest and best in automobiles regardless
of expense. Special housing accommoda
tion has been secured for it in Sussex
place, Kensington, and two chauffeurs,
who are both skilled mechanics as well
as expert speed negotiators, have been
engaged to run it. They come from New
York. Mrs. Frank Mackey' s two chauf-
Xeurs are Frenchmen.
Mrs. J. W. Mackey will not only score
over her younger rival by appearing In a
finer car. but also, where Americans are
concerned. In the natlonalltr of her chauf
feurs. But Mrs. Frank Mackey may have
some cards to play in the interesting con- ;
test between them that nobody knows
anything about. She has rented Mrs.
Adair's house on Curzon street. It makes
a first-class headquarters for an aggres- ;
sivc social campaign.
She has any amount of nerve and pluck.
The severe accident that befell her in
the bunting field early In the season has
not lessened her devotion to the sport a
bit. She has obtained a long lease of
lieauehamp Hall, near Melton Mowbray
in Leicestershire, and will hunt with the
Pylchley ' hounds next season. The fol
lowers of that pack belong to the most
exclusive set in the midland counties.
Pedigrees are supposed to count with
them far more than long purses. "But
wbtre Americans are concerned, of
course, they do not insist on the former.
Mrs. Frank Mackey has bought . several
Irish huulers. which she prefers to Eng
lish etock, and is increasing the stabling
accommodation of BeaAJchamp HalL She
expects to proyidej mounts for .several
American friends who \u25a0will be her guests
there when the hunting season opens. ' : .

LONDON.- June 10.â Arrangements are
now practically complete for the World's
Congress of Baptists, which will be held
here from July 11 to July IS. â¢ Although At
will be I the first time that , the" followers
of John- Bunyan ', and Roger, WUliams all
over the" universe -have been, brought to
gether, it promises to be one! of the big
gest .'international 1 denominational con
ference's ever; held, the delegates already
booked nuinu^mg *about\2ooo. Of these
it "is "estimated that 'over' one-third will
come from; America.. Sixteen other coun
tries will be represented. Even oppressed
and benighted Russia will make an effort
to slip* in a couple of : delegates.;
Thp : striking feature of the conference
will be the; prominence given to Ameri
can men and methods. The United States
is* the 'great stronghold of the Baptist
denomination. There ; it ; numbers some
thing over 6.000,000 members,- while in â¢ -ie
United Kingdom there are. under half a
conclave has been" planned
by English Baptists, but in arranging the
programme they ; have borne this dls
crepancyi In^mind.r.ln effect 'they have
said to the American Baptists : "You are
big and we 'are small: we want- to know
how;youhaye grown so great. Come and
teUs'us andithe rest. '"of our, brethren from
the "'\u25a0 ends "of -the I earth how you- manage

which" they/desire rAmerlcaa delegates to
speak and American Baptists" have chosen
the" speakers best \ qualified ; to â¢\u25a0 do J Justice
to them. 7 Much attention will . be paid to
education,* 7 secular and '-'religious.- The
former. is;t of ? course, s one *of England's
burning questions," many people. with ten

. The congress will be held In Exster
Hall in tba Strand, appropriately
enough, too! as that famous Baptist,
the late C. H. Spurgeon. engaged the
hall when he first came to London and
registered It as a Baptist chapel. That
still remains its legal designation, al
though It has long been owned by tha
Young Men's Christian. Association and
is a free field for all denominations en
gaged In evangelical work. One ot thÂ»
most Interesting events. of tha congress
will be ' tha v unveiling -In ; Exeter Hall
of a status of . Spurgeon.' It will sub
sequently be placed in the- new London
headquarters . of ; the Baptist -Union -In
Southampton .Row, .which, already con
tains a statue of Bunyan.
â The venerable Rev. Dr. . Alexander
McLaren of . Manchester, now in his
eightieth year, will preside over the
congress." j His task - will .be an easy
one. "1 He will have no knotty pointa of
order ; to decide. His . chief \u25a0' exercise of
authority will consist In 'maintaining a
check on the speakers and seeing that
none of them steals too much of an
other orator's time." The congress will
decide ; nothing. Its functions will be
purely deliberative. It Is invested with
no legislative powers. Baptist churches
acknowledge no central , authority.
Each one is a law unto Itself and would
scorn to sacrifice "one Jot of its dearly
prized Independence even at \u25a0 the bid
ding of a world's congress. So no res
olutions will be ;i passed beyond those
that are mere expreslons of courtesy. ; ;
V! A* committee will 'be'appolnted to ar
range for another; world's congress* of
Baptists to be held within the next
decade, probably in the United States.
The [conference will conclude, with a
monster-meeting in Albert Hall, the
largest' ln London.^ where Torrey . and
Alexander, -the American evangelists,
conducted J their.' revival meetings for
the conversion of the r.lch.; In the West
End. '\u25a0':â¢ It \ will be a; species of Interna
tional Jove; feast.
â¢ 'In .'connection " with? : the ' congress
"meetings will < be ; held fat .various Bap
tist churches .in -London. :at; which
American : ministers , will /ad- 1
dVesses. But there .will', be ouly one of
ficial 1 sermon. That will be (delivered
by the 'Rev^ Dr. Strong, president \ of >
the 'Rochester .Theological \u25a0 Seminary.: in '
the great ? . Metropolitan ; Tabernacle,
whose . pulpit was long occupied \u25a0by
Spurgebn.-^ \u25a0\u25a0 \ . * '
them some valuable Information on that
matter.. "Printing j^ress and Christian
.Literature as Missionary Agencies" will
be the title of his address.
There will be a careful avoidance of
topics calculated to awaken acrimoni
ous discussion. It has not escaped com
ment that nearly all the American dele
gates are doctors Of divinity. That de
gree when conferred In America is
lightly esteemed here because of tho
general notion that it Is so easily ob
tained that it affords no guarantee of
theological scholarship. Some of the
English delegates wished to bring the
matter before the conference, but their
suggestion has been scouted on tha
ground that a frank discussion on tha
subject might wound the sensitive feel
ings of some of the American visitors.
Some of the American "delegates wished
to discuss the attitude of the Baptist
church on the subject of divorce. That
was set aside because It; Is far from
being a burning question here and It
was thought It would be best -\u25a0 to let
American Bapists thrash It out among
themselves In their own land.

something that tends to the better
ment of their characterization.. This
digression, It may also be proper to
explain, was not prompted by her. The
third-person rule was rigidly adhered
to in all she said relative to her art.. .-., , .
"The most interesting plays to study
and develOD are the Ibsen dramas," she
resumed.. "To properly produce \u25a0 a . play
it- is necessaryfor the stage, manager
to' be thoroughly" conversant with the
author's motive and conception of each
character â to have each part at his fin
ger's ends, so to speak, before he be
gins rehearsals. He should Ibe ever
ready with suggestion to the actors,
although the best actors seldom need
suggestion, nor should he be above
accepting suggestion himself. No stage
manager is perfect, and for him to be
rigidly insistent as to how certain lines
should be read or certain gestures
made would be silly,' as well as tyran
nical. The intelligent actor, who has
thoroughly studied a role, often gives
ideas which may differ from the stage
manager's preconception, but which the
reasonable stage manager gratefully
adopts. To strive for perfection of en
semble is the delight of the conscien
tious stage manager, and such perfec
tion can only be attained by means of
earnest study and patient application
of what has been learned. In other
words, the stage manager, should be
like the leader of a good orchestra,
acquainted with each player's ability
and what Is necessary to develop the
most harmonious ensemble."
"Is It possible for a manager to com
petently direct more than one com
pany?" \ . \u25a0 \u25a0
"No man can get the best out of, a
company that Is not constantly under
his supervision. Daly produced splen
did results because he confined his at
tention to one company. .The same
may be said of Palmer and of Wal
lack."

During the past season the 10-eent vau
deville theaters have cropped up all over
the > Western part of the country In such
large numbers that they have, made, seri
ous inroads upon the business of the regu
lar traveling companies. With a view- to
obtaining some Information \u25a0 concerning
these bouses, a Dramatic Mirror repre
sentative had a chat with Harry Cran
dall, the comedian, who toured the West
ern States during the past season";'' with
"A Friend of the Family."
"There Is no question." said Mr. Cran
i dallÂ»~ "that ; these places have hurt buai
ness In many towns that used to be good
stands. In Butte, Mont., they have two
houses. ; What was formerly the flrst
class theater is now a 10-cent vaudeville
house, and: both of. the '10-centers* are
under the same management. In Tacoma
they have three houses, which is over
doing It for such a comparatively small
city. They certainly affect the'attend
ance in the balconies and 'galleries of the
other theaters.'
"In Portland there are fly* or six of
them' and they have knocked the busi
ness "endways. While I was there there
was a rumor that the Portland Theater
would run vaudeville this summer on a
scale that would tend to freeze out the
smaller places.
' "Almost every town â¢in California has
from one to three 10-cent houses.' and you
can imagine what chance a traveling
company has to make any money. In
Seattle there are four or five,' and a new
one was recently opened there that cost
$33,000. It is a fine house of its kind.' The
streets of San Francisco are lined \u25a0 with
them. While I was there I saw for the
first time In my career the gallery of the
theater, closed, because these place* had
drawn away the regular. patrons. Aa far
as I could see they have not Invaded the
South, as the people down there seem to
hanker for more substantial entertain
ment. â¢ \u25a0 0 \u25a0 * ' â¢ \u25a0-\u25a0'â¢:â¢'
"In many cases I was surprised to see
what a really good entertainment , was
given \u25a0 for the money. They . almost . al
ways have one or two good acts, but the
great majority are worse . than any
â¢chaser* ever seen in the supper-show in
the â¢ contlnuoua here in New. York. In a
good many places the managers of these
circuits have secured the best .theaters,
and these towns are wiped from the route
of the traveling manager. , The . perform
ances last from an hour to an hour and a
half, and from five to seven performances
are given every day. On . Sundays . and
holidays the bill Is repeated ten or twelve
times. The first opening occurs usually
at half-past 1, before a small house, but
the crowds Increase as the day wears on.
The patronage *s not < confined to* the
poorer classes, . either, and ,I . saw many
well-to-do people watching .the perform
ances., .The houses as a rule , are well
managed, scrupulously clean, and the /at
taches are unusually attentive. My opln- \
ion is that the fad' will die out in time,
but just at present this branch of the
theatrical business Is enjoying a wonder
ful boom." .

Her desire to appear impersonal makes
Mrs. Fiske a vexatious subject for the
Interviewer who stickles for approved
style and aims to be literal in transcrip
tion. While graciously willing to discuss
e>ny pertinent topic suggested, she abhors
the perpendicular pronoun in print and
prefers to have her views and comments
accredited to the anonymous third per
boh. "If you don't quote me as saying
so," Is the exasperating prefix to the most
Interesting things she does say, and after
they have been said her injunction is
\u25a0usually clinched with, "But if that is
published as my opinion I shall be un
happy." And what man, unless he be of
a certain opulent combine, could deliber
\u25a0 ately convey unhappiness to Minnie Mad
.dern Fiske and retain his self-respect?
\u25a0 "But," was my despairing protest,: "by
omitting the ,I'sâ your I's â the Interview
might appear prosy." ,
"Better that than have me appear vain
and conceited," she rejoined.
"But the value of comment is enhanced
by exact quotation," J argued. Â«.
"It is the quality of a sentiment rather
than the identity of its author that
makes for value," she answered.
Further appeal was clearly useless, so
with implied acquiescence that what was
said by the famous little woman would
be of no more worth or public interest
than if it were said by Mrs. John Smith
of no fame whatever, I accepted the con
dition. ;
"I dcn't want to talk about the syndl
''Because there is nothing to say on
that subject that has not been said re
peatedly," she explained.
"I would rather discuss your artâ your
plans," I suggested.
"Well, my season closes a few weeks
after we leave here, and then I may
come back and spend a portion of j the |
summer with relatives in Oakland. For |
next season we have planned a series of j
revivals at the Manhattan Theater and |
the production of a new play by Rupert j
Hughe*, treating of New York character
types of the modern school."
"And fulfillment of your last year's
promise to present Ibsen's 'Rosmersholm'
Is still indefinite?"
"But not abandoned. The play requires
extended and painstaking rehearsal, but
some day we shall settle down to its pre
paration. The character of Rebekah is
most fascinating." r ' - '
"And most morbid. Why didn't 'lbsen,
after he had racked Rosmer" and * Re
bekah with repentance, charitably make
them happy ever after?"
"Such a finish would have spoiled the
lesson," said Mrs. Fiske, quickly respon
sive to the hint that a Philistine was
â¢within the gates. "When Rebekah enters
Rosmer'e life her purpose is_ to draw him
into affinity with her ad\-ariced thought.
She is unscrupulous, absolutely 'free,'
owing .no allegiance -to dogmaâ a com
plete . iconoclast. She systematically
alienates^ the husband's love and ~ per-
Euadee^e" wife to believe that hli hap
piness can only be effected by her death,
co the woman commits suicide. Re
bekah's dominancy remains . unshaken
until, through-, her confession, Rosmer
learns that his wife's self-destruction was
not due to insanity, but to desire to pro
mote his well-being, and then he sees
with the dead woman's eyes. The de
vout religious principle of his youth re
sumes sway of his mind, and gradually
and unconsciously - Rebekah's thought
tecomes similarly affected until sheâ the
woman who had entered Rosmersholm to
*nllst its master in the cause of 'free'
livingâ becomes a religious fanatic and
agrees with him that suicide is their only
atonement for the life that their error
had sacrificed. So they die together."
"GrewEomeâ and subtle," was my cau
tious response to the narrator's inquiring
glance. â¢
"All 'the subtleties if* i>lay that: re
quires ih the" acting an 1 evening of
tense mental applicati&n cannot be ex
plained in a moment," was the rejoinder.
"But, my word for it, the psychological
contrarities of Rebekah make her a
fascinating character."
I shifted to more secure ground by
asking her what part of her work she
found most attractive, and she replied
that the theater would be uninteresting
if she were to abandon her policy of
developing each part of every play she
presents.
In this connection it may not be
amiss to explain that acting Is only
one of Mrs. Flake's accomplishments.
She is alco an author, a student, a pro
ducer, a stage manager par excellence.
The public sees her in the least impor
tant of her self-imposed tasks. All day
long she is either studying or directing
rehearsals, and between acts â aye. be
tween scenes â â¢while the play is on she
is Instructing stage hands in the set
ting of pictures or drilling supernu
meraries, or sharply watching her as
sociates act or suggesting to them

Duller than a Puritan Sunday is a sum
mer resort without menâ without llkely
lookins: men.
At all the springs and health resorts an
assorted lot of men abounds, to be sure,
but they are not In the runningâ these
old rheumatics, who can't dance nor golf
nor walk nor swim. It's the agile fellow,
the lithe and likely chap, the smart-look
ing: fellow, the man wbo walks and talk?
and swims, that xnckes the summer girl
happyâ and, incidentally, the summer re
eort a success.
IÂ«ucky the manager who can lure a lot
of eucb fellows to bis register, but. alas!
and alack! they refuse to be lured. For j
it's a noteworthy fact that men are grow- ,
Ing to fight shy of conventional outingff,
with the tuxedos and other abominations
of urban life, showing a desire to "rough ;
it" among the mountains or to camp
along the gray-green border of a marsh,
or to shoulder a gun and wander through
the great forests roundabout.
"VTlse?"â you say.
To be sure, the buey city man in wise
to eschew every phase of urban life
that* compatible with decency when his
vacation time rolls round; but what are
the girls to doâ and., incidentally, tbe
2uek)ees resort keeper? -.-â¢ \u25a0;;;'.
Simply this: To be content withâ and
to eaeourage mightilyâ week-end parties.
Now that the custom of closing banks
and business bouses on Saturday after
noons has obtained, the English custom
of week-end parties has become an estab
lished Institution. And it is said that at
some of the resorts it Is the lure of these
week-end affairs that keeps up the spirits
of sojourning maidens from week to
week.
At country houses the custom has long
been a pleasant one, and it's greats f unâ
fids ptUng In of a crowd of congenial
ipirite under one roof.
\u25a0 And It is so propitious to tne little
trrow-bearÂ«r!

ED. PINAUDÂ»S
EAU DE QUININE HAIR TONIC
The Only Satisfactory Food for Thin, Starved Hair
Everybody knows how much beauty of the hair is dependent
upon its health and the absence of dandruff from the scalp.
Dandruff, the common cause of hair loss to so many women, is
the first warning of danger to your hair, 'and must be checked or
the follicles dry up, the hair breaks and falls out and your beauty
disappears with it. ED. PINAUD'S EAU DE QUININE HAIR.
TONIC is an active foe to dandruff â invigorates the scalp, revives
the roots and stimulates a new, fresh growth at once. You cannot
do without it if you value your beautiful tresses or wish to regain
complete hair health. It is. a pleasure â a necessity to men as well
as women â and the satisfaction of watching the results can be
experienced with no other preparation.
We are also the largest manufacturers in the world of toilet
preparations and high-grade perfumes. Our name is a guarantee
of highest quality. PARFUMERIE ED. PIN AUD, PARIS. \ y

â¢ The State of New York is trying the investment .in: forests on
a la/ge scak. Eight years ago it had" 1,000,060 acres, 'and now it
has increased its holdings to nearly . i-sCÂ»,cwj and;is:expecteti soon
to buy over 1 ,000,000 more. Pennsylvania has - purchased \/. 700,000
acres of forest-land, and. is continuing its buying. The 1 fire warden
thinks the lumbermen should not be blamed; -for the rapid .con
sumption of the forests, but-that the people as a whole are responsi
ble, and they should stop it through their v legislators.' The lumber
men have bought the timber, and cannot be expected i to refrain
from taking all the profit out of it possible. It 'can be easily > seen
that no system of private control of forests cbuld j so completely' safe
guard them from waste by fire as would a unified 1 and compVehen^
si ye -plan of Government management. *
WHY the State should own forests : is one of the subjects
treated by the Chief Fire Warden of Minnesota in his re
cently issued tenth annual report. He estimates that the
forest lands of his State, if properly managed for the eighty years
which is the allotted time to produce a normal forest, would yield
a net annual revenue to the State government of $6,750,000. That
item of calculation is enough to concentrate attention on some fur
ther things he has to say about forestry. He explains that the care
of the forests is properly a function of the State, for the reasons
that the cultivation from planting to maturity extends over such
a long period, and the rewards of the work are so remote, individ
uals cannot be expected to undertake such an enterprise.
Prussia is deriving from her State forests a net annual reve
nue of $9,000,000. France gets $1 91 per acre from her 2,100,000
acres. There are many other foreign Governments profitably in
the forestry business. The big estimate for Minnesota is based on
the use of 3,000,000 acres of rocky, hilly and sandy lands that would
be unfit for agricultural use. For the State to devote this area to
forestry would mean, in addition to the large net revenue/ the giving
of employment to 30,000 men, which would "represent-a'well'sup
ported population of 120,000 on land which is -likely to become
waste, or at best only half productive when the natural growth is cut
away. Even the best lands when reforested by 7 spontaneous young
growth will only produce one-half the- yield of that, systematic for
estry which lays its plans for eight}- years and prevents the waste
of greedy cutting. The- calculation of the' fire warden .was only
made on direct benefits: the indirect ones arc not so easily, esti
mated in dollars, but they well might prove of 'more importance
than the ones which can be positively figured^ A' weH : preserved
forest would promote a steady supply of water in. the streams,, im
prove the climate, make a covert for game, and tend^to keep". the
population happy and contented by beautifying the world- in 'which
they live. . ' . - 7 .â¢â¢:/.'\u25a0â¢> ' : -/.v -\ -L;l

STATE FORESTRY.
THE . CrVTL WAR-Preaidlo. Oty. The
essential cause of the Civil AVar was slav
ery; the ostensible reason., the . doctrine
of State rights; the final pretext, the
election of Abraham Lincoln. ./
A FEW years ago men were'agitated by a desire for a universal
language. Having before them the example of the Chinook
jargon, used as a common trade language by our Pacific Coast
Indians, they believed it possible to invent a language with a lim
ited but sufficient vocabulary 'to serve >as a common' mediuni of com
munication between: all the peoples of the earth. In the' execution of
this plan volapuk was invented, but it soon had /to find its only use
in writing its own epitaph, for it died quickly. . It seemed demon
strated that man will not take his language as he does his reaper
and. mower, his. dynamo and chug: wagon and otherinventions. His
speech must grow, get its accretions from all sources and be ex
pressive of the needs of and communication, as these
grow.' \u25a0....'\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0. '-\u25a0 \u25a0'\u0084',"["; C.'.': : '.- '-\u25a0': - . â¢â¢â¢\u25a0â¢ .'â¢ . /â¢'â¢ \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0 '".':\u25a0 ; ! V J "

describe a universal: language,' already exists in our English '. tongue.
Japan and Russia both- have difficult: languages, written in strange
alphabets. When the fleets of the two nations met and fought in
the Strait of Korea there was no common medium of speech. in which
they could demand- 1 or concede surrender, hail the wounded or take
the last wishes of, the dying. But after it; was over and Togo called

slip happened to be a "call" blank, and
he began penciling his figures in the 3:30

35 cents for" carfare, $160 for express
charges, 50 cents for trunk straps. 5 cents
for paper and a quarter for a messenger.
Down at the bottom, as an after thought,
he put 40. and wrote "beer" after it..

HOTEL YARN
For much of this there is a remedy in a return to the house
hold arts. All over the country are women's clubs, congresses and
conventicles. Let these take the matter up and preach a. return
to the home production of nearly all the foodstuffs that we now
buy in bottles and cans. Every house that has. a kitchen can easily
and cheaply manufacture its own catsups, jams, jellies and canned
fruits and vegetables. The bright brass kettle of our grand
mothers produced all % of these things in greater excellence than
the modern factory has ever attained. That old kettle is now
obsoleted by the enameled hollowware, that is- cheap and safe.
Let the cry of revolt be "'back to the kitchen stove â see how it
jells." Bring forth the household .jam. pot r ,and fill it with- the
good old stuff, and let the adulterator go broke and perish among
his drugs. Fruit is cheap in the marketplace, and sugar is to be
had so cheaply that its price would have made our grandmothers
think that the saccharine heavens had opened.
Let the women's club be swung on the head of the adultera
tor and he will cease. Let the fruity odors rise again in the kitchen
steam and the rows of pots, jelly tumblers and jars take their
place on the storeroom shelves. The housekeeper has the remedy
in her own hands and is the mistress of the situation.
THE hunt for adulterations was supposed to; be. necessarily;
closed when it included catsups and canned , stufts,; preserved
meats and wines and liquors. These were, found -; to -be
variously enriched by ch'cmical anti-ferments, and made. beautiful
io the eye by coal-tar dyes. We discovered that we were all get
tin- a nip oi formaline,' salicylic acid, benzoic acid and ..arsenic
wit!; our victuals and drink., and we resorted, more to fresh meats
hi "the innocent belief that they were not in any respect the prod
uct of the chemical laboratory or the dye works. But the search
for <ophi Plication was extended to the meat markets,. and in many
of them (the list is published), it , was found .thaf fresh meat kept
beyond its time was saved from the morgue by injurious preserva
tives, and then to give it the hue of .health was dyed. with, aniline,
making it to assume the rare text and color of prime stuff. This
seems to be the limit. We have now coal-tar lemon. pies and. our
chops and steaks arc dyed like ribbons. . " "
Xo wonder that the vermiform appendix is in revolt and. that
the human spleen swells with indignation,, for this is a wicked
and adulterating generation. Whether we feed on the flesh of
beast, bird or fish, we arc in doubt of the kind ! and 'quantity of
poison it contains; and whether we wash it down .with ; water,
milk, wine or whisky, we are apt to be adding a -liquid': poison -to
a solid dose of the same. â¢ '.^, .-'"""
It has always. been considered a freak in XebiicKadnezzar that
he went to pasture and fed on grass- with the dairy- cows, but
now many are led to follow his example, for the" green of the
grass is not produced by copper or coal tar. The rnari. whose
crops had been destroyed by a late frost, called by the preacher
providential, declared that one year with another- providence ;drd
more harm than good. So some may say of chemistry^ It - has
pushed its quest in all directions, until we are -able to 'know tlic
chemical nature of the matter that composes the- planets^ and
stars and also that of turnips and potatoes,' soils arid rocks." ' ;'" \u25a0*
Knowledge is pleasant and its field has been % extended by. the
disciples of Lavoisier, but in doing this they have given us dynamite
and the other "ites"' produced by the nitrates and ptcrates,' and
they have taken ill-smelling coal tar and from ..it have made per
fumes that imitate the aroma of every flower, and 1 dyes that: used
in our hosiery poison our blood and kill us, and that are now being
used to make our food and drink more dangerous to life' than
Togo's torpedoes. Man must be physically- tough to stand it, for
when he gets full of strange dye stuffs and acids and his alimentary
canal is a mere outfall sewer for poison" used in his food and drink,
and he turns to the drugstore for relief, his medicines are adulte
rated also and his last estate is worse than his first.

sort of way there was a quick,' keen flash,
and' a sharp crack ' that seemed to split
one whole side of the earth. I was dazed,
blinded- and shocked for a few seconds. .
As soon as I had recovered my eyes fell
on the blackboard again, and. curiously .
enough. Just at a point in one of the races
where, a name had been suddenly "marked;

Volume About Plants ,\ -A
by W. J;V. Osterhout
When we look at the picture of Pe
trarch, with his laurel wreath by which
the Roman Senate crowned him poel
laureate, we can realize how he won
that crown by remembering this that he
wrote about his " love | for Laura: A'The
little that I am, I am through her. What
ever fame or glory I may have I could
not have attained it if the weak seed of
virtue which' nature, planted in my heart
had not been' developed by this noble af
fection." and we can think of- this i that
Agnes Tobin says of him:
To Petrarch life was but a mirror fair, '
Wherein his lady's beauties tranced lay. -, -
Her eyes, her lips, ' her voice, her smile, her
half.
Made the strange spectrum of his lonely day,
When we look at the image of Laura
â Canova's bust perhaps gives the most
pleasing impression of herâ we "can re^
call this sympathetic rendering of Pej
trarcli's . word picture of her:
Oh, face that day and : night, ; . .- f,
- Fostered my longing. . \u25a0â¢
The -dream, the â¢ laughter, and the dream

.â. \u25a0 ETRARCH and â¢ that Laura,
J V whom his poetic genius made
Iâ^ immortal in human memory,
I and â let gallantry not falter in
" believing It â Laura and that
Petrarch whom her angelic
Braces, shown through that glorious
woman-beauty In which her spirit was
incarnate, taught while his soul was
still on earth its love- winged "Flying
Lesson" which made his poems possi
ble, are what the beautiful little book
of verse by San Francisco's Miss Agnes
Tobin is all about â them and their
love, most lovingly interpreted by tal- |
ented translation of the lover t 's son
nets and canzoni. Let us. by ah act of
faith, consider it correct to say dually
*'their love." rather than his love, for
though Laura while on earth could not
in sweet religion's law give response
to thisâ one of the greatest passions
of history. It would be unpoetic infidel
ity to doubt that a love like Petrarch's
Will live on and up to the heaven where
joetic vision saw her as graciously re
sponsive; and there â what know we of
now heavenly relationships to make us
fear the love-laws of the eternities,
"when God shall unsex us on the fur
ther shore," would bar the singer from
the love of the beautiful inspirer of
his immortal songs.
The collection of beautiful .transla
tions is well called "The Flying ;Les-
Eon," for although the title is taken
from a single sonnet anent Laura's own
lesson in use of new given angrcl
wings.
How plain I ccc the sapphire studded gatesâ
ThP vaporous angels coaxUig her to flyâ

the whole music of all the lines in the
book is a "flying lesson." We see by all
Us paEFion-breathlng pages how Pe-^
trarcrTs love, -which was seven years
euUimated before \f. became poetry,
taught him that flying/ lesson by which
from its first starting point of passion
for physical possession his wish became
ever stronger and manlier In the exalta
tion of its desire, till his "spirit drank
renouncement even as wine" and he could
Kay of the woman, "I loved only her
soul."
. It. is also to all of us who read a flying
lesson taught as by Agnes Tobin, for
when f*he, by power and grrace of poetic
temperament, diligently trained, brings
home to us from far Italian lands, from
distant ages, and out of a language for
eign to our ken, that story that rings
true poetry in the melody of our own
mother tongue about a love passion that
bore itself to spiritual victory above all
teeming baffling and that triumphed over
death, she helps us to go thought-winged }
with our guardian angels up to where we |
can believe that our dead still live amf
love us. She so uses her t of poetry
to uplift that all men. standing where
grief can any moment lead themâ in fact,
in memory or in imagination's forecast
may find in the book's treasures the
same fine answer Petrarch found to that
pleading over Laura's grave: - '

" Bernard Shaw's "Man and Superman"
has Just been played in London, omitting
the third act. which ia pretty near as
long as the rest of the play. The critics
of the book. had thought this play unact
able, but it meets with great success as
abridged. The third act. containing some
of the best of Shaw, was found to be im
practicable for stage purposes. \ . .

Helen Keller, deaf, dumt) and blind,
has written for the June McClure'a her
"Apology for Going to College." It 19
a charming and modestly told story of
a splendid triumph of optimism, and
aside from the fact that It was written
by this wonderful girl. It Is of moving
human interest. "I was of course
hampered," sha says, "by my limita
tions, . which turned to drudgery much
work that might have been delightful;,
for they imposed upon me tedious meth
ods of study. I was often behind In my
work at a distance forbidden by mili
tary law; I was never ahead; and once
I fell so far behind that it seemed as If
I might as well try to keep pace with i
shooting star! Experience, however,
taught me to . tack against wind anil
tide â the first lesson of life "I learned
tn * college. * And this was easier with
Miss Sullivan at the helm. I would not
part with pne of those struggles against
the j galesâ the winds and the persecu
tions of the sky. They tested my pow
ers and developed the,,. Individuality
which . I had been advised to bring up
on books at home. . . Although I
always tried to work with a cool head
and steady hand, and sleep according to
the law, I too was drawn into this
whirlpool of confused. incomplete
tasks."

ABOUT PETRARCH'S POETIC LOUSE FOR LAURA. Judge.i^awlor yesterday overruled the
demurrer interposed by Attorney George
D." Collins to the indictment of the Grand
Jury charging him with : bigamy. ! The de
fendant I pleaded not guilty, and ; against
his ! objection khe : case was ' set | f or ; trial
on June 26^ Judge T.J.l>ennon of Marin

he would apply. for a writ of prohibition
to the rDistrict- Court of "- Appeals, 7 and
wou ld also . take the - case : to the -United
States Circuit ' Court on the; question of
jurisdiction, and ' if ; - necessary . to the
United; States Supreme Court. . . -\u25a0
The Judge delivered a' long' decision on
the points raised in the \ demurrer, chiefly
the I one bearing on the court's Jurisdic
tion to! try the! case./ The Judge held that
if,: a bigamous marriage was , ; consum- j
mated Jin another State and -^the : parties
to that j marriage came to 4 this State arid
lived openly 3 as* husband" arid \ wife) â¢ the
court had jurisdiction under the law. The
Judge â¢ held that' the indictment Iwaa 1 iuf
ficient, and , overruled ;â¢ the ? demurrer -on
all of the grounds' submitted. : He, said he
had been "much, aided' by the briefsflled
in reaching his* conclusions.*^ . "
Collins â¢ promptly : took exception : to ..the
rulingy of ; ;the 'court 'and' said s - that- as a
basis for a writ of prohibition to the Dis^
: trict Court [of -Appeals ' he would call 1 the
I attention of I the Â« courts to -the defect ; in
the \u25a0jurisdiction and- to' the other- points
raised in his demurrer.

suggested that, tho defendant \ make | his

he could make his motion. ' ;.\u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢:
; The Judge : decided that the next â¢ step"
would be to 'take the defendant's plea,
and Collins thereupon moved ; that his ar
raignment be set aside,. as the document
on, which he was arraigned- was. not the
original Indictment.^ The ' Judge denied the

: /."Then I plead j not guilty," eald ; Collins,
"and' have- to: say that the charge -is ab

' Byington' suggested that the case be set
for > trial f on June 26,' but Collins objected,
as he had to subpena numeroys witnesses
and the time was too limited. 1 The Judge;
however, set the case for trial on June 26.,
Collins again- made his motion in regard
to \u25a0 the â¢â¢ writ of prohibition.: and the Judge
said he would take It under advisement. \u25a0

City Engineer Woodward takes ex

Federation 4>t Mission Improvement
Clubs that the engineering work for
the paving of the crossing of Vicks :
burg and Twenty-fourth streets was
improperly -done some, ten years ago,
resulting in the unlevel joining of'the
pavements 'on the two streets. Wood
ward says that on April 25 last he
called the attention of the Board. of
Works to the bad condition- of the
pavement, which was due to>the care-,
lessness of the contractors who per;
formed the work. It will be necessary
to reconstruct a strip of the pavement
five feet in width. The fault. Wood
ward says, lies not* with : the official
grades as established, but- to the negli
gence of the contractors to conform to
the grades and the failure of the In
spectors to see that the work was
properly done at the time. Other pave
ments in similar condition will receive

PARIS, June 10.â Camile Flammarlon,
writing on the. influence of sun spots on
spring vegetation, says that for the last
twenty years he has noticed the date on
which the chestnut trees In the Avenue
de rObBervatoire have \u25a0a ; leaved . and
bloomed. From these records he â¢ shows
that there Is a remarkable correlation
between sun spots and vegetation, tend
ing -to show that the sun throws out
more heat .when the spots reach their
maximum, thus confirming Abbe 7 Mo
reau's theory that the spots indicate the
period of the greatest solar activity.

LONDON. June 10. â "The United
States of America and Germany are not
only ousting Britain from her foreign
markets, but they are flooding her
home markets with goods cheaper than
Â«he can make them," said Senator R.
W, Best of the Australian Common
wealth Parliament to a number of city
merchants and others assembled under
the auspices of the Australian Chamber
of Commerce in London. "British
travelers." he added, "were simply no
where in comparison with the tenacity
and puphfulness of the American and
German travelers. English merchants
were far too conservative. They would
not change their methods, measure
ments and other details on any account
and the result was a loss of trade.
"As an instance of the need to keep
up to the changes of the day," he said,
"Australian carpenters had found the
American hammer better shaped and
more suited to their needs than the
Knglish-made article. The Germans
discovered this and at once made their
hammers of American shape and ob
tained a large portion of the trade
which England is losing!
"These were only single Items' in an
almost endless list. It was a host of
such things that made Australia buy
Â£23.700,000 ($128,500,000) worth of goods
yearly from British commercial rivals."

Mrs. Roosevelt has been a guest of

day the President joined her here and
In the evening 1 , after dinner, he decided
that they would go over and stay in
the cabin all nlghtmnguarded.
As simply as a Virginian rural couple
they went alone to the little : frame,
structure among the 'trees and slept
peacefully, .with the" nearest human
being a 'quarter 'Of -a mile away. "
Mre. Roosevelt" was the cook this
morning. She did not rouse the Presi
dent, but went down alone to- light the
oil Move. . Xat.a. .*!nirle match could be
found in the cabl. . Finally, from a
ntsgro, who passed along, a match was
obtained .by .the, Presidents- wife, and.
breakfast was soon prepared.
The greater portion of the day was
spent by the President out of doors "and
around the stables of Mr. Wilmer; He' is
charmed with the country. On Sunday'
afternoon or Monday he will return to
Washington.
RICHMOND. Va., June 10.â Mrs.
Roosevelt cooked breakfast for her
husband \u25a0 this morning-, and from all
accounts, though It was a simple meal,
the President enjoyed It more than he
has enjoyed more elaborate ones in the
past. This democratic meal was eaten
at the country home of Mrs. Roosevelt
near Scottsville, Albemarle County,
which she bought a few days ago from
the President's friend, W. N. Wilmer,
\u25a0whose country home is a very short
distance away. The Roosevelt "estate"
consists of fifteen acres of forest, -with
a email cabin.

"The text of the American note, does
honor to the sentiments of President
Roosevelt. He expresses the wish of
the whole world for peace. Both in
form and substance, his document is
most commendable. These are times
when nations should put aside their
amour propre and consider the great
ends of civilization. Will the belliger
ents comprehend that tbe supreme mo
ment has arrived?"
I.IM2VITCU GUTS RESULTS.
The Temps and Debats devote col
umns to President Roosevelt's action.
The Debats says:
"The President of the United States
Is particularly able to adopt these pa
cific works, for America is not allied
to those belligerents ar.d her interests
in the extreme Orient are without po
litical partiality. Moreover, friendly
traditions attach the United States to
both Russia and Japan. Mr. Roosevelt
is, therefore, better able than any
other chief of state to engage the at
tention of the two contending parties,
and the manner in which he has taken
this step is admirable. Neither Rus
sia nor Japan can take the slightest
umbrage. President Roosevelt, in mak
ing this appeal in the interest of the
\u25a0world at large, doee not go beyond uni
versal sentiment, which stands behind

Diplomatic Triumph.
PARIS, June 10. â The news that
President Roosevelt 'has succeeded in
bring-ing: Russia and Japan together
has proved a veritable coup de theatre
to official and diplomatic quarters and
the French public generally. Early In
the day the text of the President's mes
sage excited widespread attention and
comment, the prevailing view being
that it was a fearless move on his part,
which disregarded the usual restraints
of diplomacy in order to attain the su
preme end. Wonderment waa shown
when a later dispatch from Washing
ton announced that both parties had
accepted President Roosevelt's sugges
tion and t hat a meeting between them
was assured.
A member of the French Council of |
State said that President Roose\'elt
had given the world signal evidence of
the United States' beneficial Influence
in the world's affairs.
WASHINGTON. June 10.â From an
authoritative ofncial' source it 1s
learned to-day that it has beenprac
tically determine d that the ..plenipo
tentiaries of Ja;<nn and Kussia for the
determination of peace terms will hold
their sessions in Washington.
Japan's acceptance of the President's
"offer :of good will" .haÂ§ reached the
State Department in a Cablegram from
Minister Griscom. Rucsia's reply foi
lawed later, bnt not In time to be de
ciphered to-nig-ht. It is expected that
it will be made public to-morrow.

LOXDOX. June 10.â James Van Alen.
the American millionaire, who. like
Astor, prefers lin^land to Amtrlca, is
bent or. acquiring something that shat!
cut-pass anythir.fr of its kind in Europe,
He has decided that it shall be a Jlsh
pond. For somi time he has haU one
under cotistruction at Rushtun Hall, tne
fine old English estate in Northampton
shire, which he is bringing up to date.
He has " .several tin-.es enlarged . the
boundaries which he had originally set
to it/ but it is now approaching comple
tion. T<# mark it"as something unique,
apart from its size. It will be Inclosed
hy a wall of epecially prepared .nosaie.
An Italian artist named Nadali, from
Milan, is now at Rushton Hall working
up the design for it. When it Is erected
anybody who sots oyes on it will know
that it cost a mint of money. Naturs
unaided irny provide a nsh-porid an.i
stock it and het up trees and pretty
ecenery around It But nature doesn't
deal in walls o? Italian mosaic. That
Is where Van Alen finds a chance: to
make his wealth count. .; \u25a0 ' -- >
The pond is to be slocked with both
English and American fish, so that Van
Alen's English friends will be "able to
angle, for American fish during . the
close season for native epecies. A man
.wise in the ways ot. fish has been en
gaged to'atteud to the stocking; of. the
pond.' Later on another, piscatorial "ex
pert will be permanently retained
whose aole duty it will bo to see to Jt
that ; the flsa are maintained In good
condition. Meanwhile the transforma
tion of the historic hall: proceeds apace
and - the - grounds are being laid ; iut ma
a fashion which proclaims. a: lofty, dis
regard for auch a trivial detail as cx

in Europe.
The place Is rich in historic associa
tions. It formed part of the estate of
Tostl, brother of Harold, the last of the
E&xon Kings. Around and about it are
numerous "barrows," in which the an
cient" Britons buried their dead with
primitive ornaments of clay and virgin
rold. Hard by it was that Sir Walter
Tyrrel! rode hotfoot from the murder of
Rufus, and for many a long year, after
that ride the manor had to pay forfeit
for not having stopped the regicide at the
ford, which has ever since been called
TyrreH's ford. The time has been when
the Malmesbury cellars had marvelously
fine stores of old wines and spirits, for
v.hJch never a merchant's bill was forth
coming. Round about Heron's Court the
emugglers had secure hiding places, and
when .with clash and clatter of,- horses
and loads they galloped past the windows
of the bouse the lord of the estate was
wont . caxelully .to turn I his back trÂ» ( the
window. He could- then truthfully swear
that he had seen no smugglers pass that
way. - - ! Â»,\u25a0--:-:
LONDON, June 10.â The Earl of Malmes
bury, whose marriage to the Hon. Doro
thy Cafthorpe, fourth daughter of Lord
and Lady Calthorpe, was recently cele
brated nl great style. Is certainly one of
the lucky ones. Good fortune attended
fcis birth. In . the . important matter, of
getting born he succeeded in beating his
twin brother, and that slight seniority
has sufficed to make him a peer and the
owner of one of. the most delightful and
rcmantic old places in England. The
brother who so narrowly missed the fam
ily inheritance has not even a barren
title to console him, but is doomed to so
through life as plain Charles Harris.
Lord Malmesbury is 32 years old. a high
churchman aiid a strong Conservative.
He once acted as private secretary to
Lord Beauchamp during the laucr's term
of Governorship in New South Wales.
There was very little work attached to
It, . but it sufficed to convince the lucky
twin that he was not cut out for a stren
uous existence. He hunts, shoots and
"motes" Â»nd generally gets a good time
out of life. His bride is only 39 years old,
rather dark and, -with fine eyes and. gives
promise erf blossoming Into a beauty in a
few years. She was "raised" In the coun
try and -kept there pretty, near all her
life, so that society has had no chance to
epoii her.
Heron Court, Lord Malmesbury's coun
try home, is one of the show places of
Hampshire. The domain is on two riv
ers, the Avon and the Stour, and the.lat
terâwhich in the season Is covered with
\u25a0water liliesâ runs near the house, through
the grounds and garden. But the great
beauty of the place lies in its â¢\u25a0forest" oi
rhododendrons,- which in late spring af
ford a most brilliant feast of coloring,
ranging from mauve and violet to the
richest crimson. For the rest the grounds
ere large and. well. wooded and the. wild
fowl shooting is among, the best in. the
country. .

in the case of the improvement com

signed by the Dominican Minister for
Foreign Affairs and the American, Mi

only "'a project" for a contract. The
award pronounced is not within the
terms fixed to pay amounts which It
probably does not owe, unless after an
adjustment of accounts according to
the vote of Congress of September 30,
1901, of which the improvement com

SEATTLE. Wash., lune 10. â The log
gers' combine has issded a new price
list, effective July 1. An increase of
from 50 cents to 51 a thousand' feet
over prices ruling June 1 is made. The
Increase is due to the fact that by cur
tailing the output, the loggers, working
together, have reduced the surplus sup
ply from 155,000,000 feet one year ago to
less than 20.000,000 feet to-day. The
increase of 50 cents per 1000 feet ap
plies to the ordinary grades. The in
crease of SI per 1000 feet relates en
tirely to the longer lengths, which are
becoming scarcer year by year.
New Schedule Will Go Into
Effect on the First
of July.

decision was by any means final; VHe
told the Warden that he Intended to

MILWAUKEE. Wis.. June 10.â The
Journal to-day prints a story of the
double life of Peter H. Deacon, who died
in Chicago on April 13 last. -
' According to the story as told by John
Keating. Deacon's son-in-law. Deacon
TÂ»ved a double life for twenty years, hav
ing at the same time families in Somer
ville. Mass.. which is a suburb of Boston,
and in Milwaukee. Deacon was a lead
ing a member of St. James Episcopal
Church.
The story of the double life leaked out
during the adjustment of life insurance
policies. According to Keating's story
Deacon represented to his Somerville,
Mage., wife that he was a traveling man
and that his business kept . him in the
West most of the time. His visits to his
Eastern home were limited to about two
each year. For a long time Deacon sup
ported bis Somerville wife and seven
children, but of late his contributions
ceased altogether.
Mrs. Deacon No. 1 is 61 years old, and
Mrs. Deacon No. 2, the Milwaukee wife,
about twenty years younger. Deacon at
the time of his death was S3 years old.

LEADS DOUBLE LIFE
FOR TWENTY YEARS
MILWAUKEE, June 10.â Prank
Bigelow, the defaulting bank . presi
dent, this afternoon pleaded guilty to
an indictment .of ten counts, returned
by the Federal Grand Jury, charging
violations of the national bank law.
and was sentenced by United States
District Judge Quarles to ten years at
bard labor in the Federal penitentiary
at Fort Leavenworth. Kans.
Shortly after Bigelow entered the
courtroom Judge Quarles arrived. Unit
ed States Attorney Butterfleld at once
made an announcement that an indict
ment containing ten counts had been
returned br the Federal Grand Jury
against Frank G. Bigelow, all of which
were for violations of the national
banking laws. Bigelow stated that he
'wished to waive examination and plead
goillty to all the counts contained in the
indictment.
District Attorney Butter add ad
dressed the court, etatlngr that he did
not believe the law in any case looks
toward the meting out of vengeance,
but that the law seeks to have justice
done. He stated that the minimum
sentence In this case was five years and
the maximum ten years on each count.
It seemed to him that In simple justice,
In vindication of the law. a maximum
sentence on one count should be ad
ministered In this case.
Judge Quarlcs expressed* profound
Borrow at the stern duty with which
he was confronted, but a public of
ficer should not shrink from his plain
duty. The case. Involving the misap
propriation of the funds of a bank, was
a most serious one. The crime charged
was not only a gross violation, but
tended to destroy confidence. The court
could see no palliating circumstances
and the ends of justice must be served
by the meting out of the extreme pen
alty. In order to provide against any
possibility of an error being estab
lished in any of the ten counts, the
court said he would pronounce sen
tence on each count. The sentence im
posed will be concurrent and not cum
ulative. Judge Quarles then pro
nounced that it was the sentence of
the court that Bigelow shall serve ten
yetrs at hard labor in the federal pen
itentiary at Fort Leavenworth. Kans.,
sentence to begin at noon to-day.
BigeJow evidently was prepared for
the worst, as he took the sentence
coirlly. He was immediately turned
over to the United States Marshal.

FATHER SENDS SON
TO PENITENTIARY
' NEW'~YORK, June 10.â The f sudden
life Infused into -the stock market; to
day. Justified the opinion of those : who
have complained that much of the de
pression in activity has-been due to the
I open dispute" over, the . affairs of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society. V;The
steps achieved: at yesterday's meeting
toward : eff ectin g a settlement of the
affairs of the society were accepted as
a promise that the. violent phases at
least of the trouble have passed and
i that the uneasy attention which has
been attracted 1 throughout the financial
world will; now lose Its absorption ; and
its effect, on sentiment." The encourage
ment felt .was substantially manifested/
in the large buying orders at the open
ing of the market. Some blocks of im
portant; stocks were taken at a.sub
stantial 'advance, in "price over last
night. There was some profit , taking,;
but the advance was strongly resumed.
after the appearance of the bank state
ment. I The large loan ' contraction was
attributed r to the preparation for the re
distribution of the Japanese loan {de
posits. ." Operators were inclined also to
anticipate a favorable Government crop
report, to be given out later in the' day", "
and which might - help the market on
Monday. The market closed strong and'
active/with prices up from one to; over
three points on the day.
The bond market was, firm r in sym
pathy. Total sales of bonds, par value,
J2.630.000.
Vital interest is attached to the
course of the iron and steel trade. .The
market for pigiron apparently : con
tinues in a state of .deadlock and soft
ness in the marekt for various lines of
finished products is pronounced to exist
by the recognized , 'organ of the trade.
A revival of strength for one day In
the United States' Steel ; shares was of
marked sympathetic effect .on .the
whole list of \u25a0 securities and
demonstrated the importance attached'
to this subject. as an Influence on the
whole speculative outlook." Their ' sub
sequent heaviness was of equal effect.
A supplementary . influence was the
movement of Amalgamated Copper.
United States bonds were all un
changed-on call.

Owner of Famous Utah Mine
Says Reports of Nevada
Mines Fail to Do Justice.
James Farvell of Salt Lake City, own
er of. the famous Quincy mines of Park
City, Utah, from which $2,000,000 of ore
was taken out in- eighteen months, has
purchased tho southeast end of Bonanza
Mountain, in the Bull Frog district. Mr.
FarrelLsays:" '. ,; ;. .. '\u25a0

you always expect^to hear .reports^of
rich strikes and great values,; and, as a
rule, when â¢ you come to . trace

true. In: the" Bull Frog district- it is
very different. Nothing '\u25a0 that I : have
read -of the country-has done justice-to
it. It is 1 impossible .to- exaggerate: the
surfaceiindications there. . I went down
to Bull Frog- at the request of J.-; H.
Shocklcy, the noted mining engineer. ' I
have always considered ; him ultracon
servativo,'and when he wired me that
there : was sufficient > to interest ' me in
Bull Frog I thought the trip worth tak
ing, but \u25a0at that ;\u25a0 I was not abii
over-confident. m Mr. ! Shockley told .me
that if I would go down there he would
show me more gold on : the surf ace. than
I : ever saw in a: mining camp, 'and 'he
has certainly done-so." v "a r

The range was 1000 yards* and the target
was 21 by 17 feet, consisting. of a painted
muslin screen and floated on ; a raft.- /
Rear Admiral Evans, who was in com
mand of the squadron, said:
"If the squadron had been firing at an
enemy there would have been no enemy
In half an hour."
Rear Adimlral Evans said that the

that while at Newport News the Ken
tucky communicated with the cruiser

LONDOX. June 10.â The preliminary
skirmish In (the action in which Waiter
Baron yon Radeck is string Captain Som
erset Saunderaon of his Majesty's army
for damages by reason of defamation of
character has come to a conclusion to
the House of Lords.
Their lordships upheld the decisions of
the master, the Judge in chamber*, and
the Court of Appeal, and ordered the der
fendant to answer certain interrogatories
administered to him by the plaintiff. \u25a0
Montague Lush, K. C. appearing for
Captain Saunderson. said the action was
one . for r slander, the derendant having
made a statement concerning the Baron
to a, certain woman mentioned ... In , the
statement of claim. â¢ and thereDy caused
him,; the plaintiff, the loss of her society
and hospitality, and in consequence spe
cial damage. The i woman, in the case is
Mrs. Charles Wilson. â¢
The slander complained of was tha ut
terance of the following words:
"He is not -at all a desirable man to
know.. He has received money from wo
men and I have myself seen a check he
had from one woman, and the amount.
I believe, waÂ« JESOCO."'
This, the Baron said, meant that he .was
a disreputable, immoral and dishonorable
person \u25a0 and not fitted for decent society.
The captain, in his defense, said that
the words did not bear the alleged or any
defamatory meaning, that , the piaintifC
had not. suffered any damage thereby,
that the words were not actionable \u25a0with
out proof of special damage, .the alleged
special damage being too remote, and
that, if the words were spoken or pub
lished, it was done by the defendant bona.
fide, without malice and on a, privileged
occasion/ ..^ --..'., . , . * , \
With regard to privilege,' the facts were.
in shorty that the plaintiff had come over
to England from Germany, and had. be
come acquainted with tha lady, who was
an intimate friend of Captain Saunderson.
and * had invited her and her daughter
and a friend, whom she might Invite, to
dine with him at his fiat. '
The lady Invited the ceiendant." and on
June 14. 1904, prior to the date of the din
ner, he spoke the words complained of.
but. as he alleged. In good faith, without
malice, and in the belief that they were
true, doing so because both he and the
lady nad a common interest in knowing
what - were - the character and reputation
and social standing of the plaintiff before
they! availed themselves of his invitation
and became on intimate terms with him.

would keep the home bright and cheerful
and that I would ask Mrs. Rogers > to!
take her place beside me. â¢ I, could not*
promise her that at the ' time, but ' that
was nearly three years ago. , We â¢ have
both been lonesome in our homes, and to
day Mrs. Rogers will come from-Sacra

Thomas is a well-known president /ot

property and lives on the income/While
time has grizzled his hair and beard, he
states that his heart is still young, and
that while . both will remember the* de

ships will only serve to tie them closer
together.

pelled , Judge Mogan to postpone Mr.
Cohn's arraignment - another week.
O'Brien's refusal to give 'Cohn a sum of
$500 In payment- for his alleged alienation
of Mrs. Cohn's affections was the cause
of the shooting, and O'Brien has since

At request ! of - Mrs. Deneavi the Judge

C. ; : grocer at -Twenty-fifth . and Church
streets, requested Judge Mogan to de
clare null and void the complaint of wife
beating which she had filed and which at
the time . of filing 'she 'was determined to
prosecute most relentlessly. '
, Her change of Intention, f Mrs. Ebling
explained, was caused partly by Henry's
altere'd '_ behavior toward her â¢ and : partly
by newspaper misrepresentation of her
self and her past. After Henrys- arrest
and release on bail he fairly deluged her
with endearments, â¢ punctuated | with ex
pressions of regret and pledges of reform,
and she no longer had the heart; to con
sign such an excellent fspouse to lncar
cerationJ As^for the complained. of press
statements â¢ anent * herself, vthey depicted
her as a" former daughter, of- one of Oom
Paul's 'regiments of sharpshooters, while
the fact was that she did not see actual
field service 'during her entire sojourn in
the Transvaal, ' although .her sympathy,
was , with" her countrymen in .their J strug
gle to, maintain national Independence. It
was true that 'since her marriage to Hen
ry she -had supported herself by. manu
facturing sausages and peddling them in
a two-horse wagon, also j that with her
own fair hands she groomed and feeds the
animals/ The primal "cause of the'con
jugal "tiff" was, she might- inform jthe
court, Henry's assertion that she did not
know how-to properly- cook beans. The
criticism piqued ; ; her, .because ; she had
made a specialty of cooking: beans dur
ing the troublous ; times , in : South ' Africa",
and it was just possible that her retort
to. Henry was sufÃdentlyexasperatlng to
Justify him In striking her. At any rate,
she * was willing \ to 'let bygones .be by
gones," and would the 1 Judge please order
Henry's dismissal? ,;'
"On one condition I will accede to your
request," was the response, v."and It Is
that \u25a0 if difference of ] opinion * over bean
cookery or anything else. should disturb
your restored domestic felicity,- you and
Henry will fight -it out at home." ;

'As the story was told to ' Police Judge
Cabaniss, , the, old man's unwarranted
meddling with matters in which jhe \u25a0 had
no direct personal concern was. at the
bottom of the rumpus. He stood on Cali
fornia street, ..between Lyon : street and
Central avenue, ; where" the , grade is steep,
and jeered at John Clancy's ' endeavor to
persuade a brace of unwilling horses to
haul a heavy load of lumber iip' the ac
clivity. Mr. Clancy j chirruped with his
lips,, gently flicked the flanks, of his ani
ma Is with . a whiplash and coaxingly said,
''Giddap, .boys,'' , and no. sooner,- did the
brutes show inclination to : obeyVthan the
old man â¢ yelled, '.'Whoa, - thqr'e !" : until
they, 4 halted, and then profanely 1 accused
Mr. Clancy of incompetency as a driver.
He did the . very â¢ tame thing > with % Mr.
Brady when that gentleman was steering
his team up the : .hill, : .and he repeated it
when Mr.vHopley came atop of hW wagon
and began to scale the' elope.? Not .qiie of
the teamsters could afford to abandon* his
horses until he' had landed 1 them 'upon the
apex,, but as quickly, as ; that ; was accom
plished the; trio descended -and -entered
into I argument \ with ; the ; aged % mischief
maker. The first -to accost, him was Mr.
Brady, and': the " ancient '.one at- onge put
up his hands in approved pugilistic atti
tude.and showed willingness to -fight. Mr.
Clancy stepped in to prevent actual "com
bat,, and 'twas ? then : Mr... Davelle | entered
the . incident .With ; a \u25a0 fist \u25a0he ; smote Mr.
Brady's nose, scraping some "cuticle" from
the organ, and then the antique unknown
aimed I a blow at j Mr. Brady's | face, and
then Mr. Clancy delivered % his X bridge
smashing â¢ blow , on Mr. Davelle's '-, nose,
and then Mr. Hooley. plunged 'into the
scrimmage. After ' sharply . rapping Mr.
Clancy's right wrist with' a heavy black
thorn stick. â¢ the gray r haired ' starter ~of
the unpleasantness Â§ vanished .as . if ,' the
earth had absorbed . him, and a . moment
later \ Patrolman O'Shea arrived and Mid
the rest.. \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 .. \u25a0 \u25a0 ' \u25a0 . '< - : \u25a0 '.- ;
; After - giving 'his testimony, , Mr. Da
velle, who. lives at .1256 "Montgomery
street, pointed,, to >his- damaged nose,
and, addressing .the, defendants, -ex
claimed. "No one, of you could do this,"
and then to the Judge he' said,' "If
these men settle . my ! doctor's bill : and
pay me for the ; time ) l've 'been \u25a0 idle on
account of my; injury Ilwon't prosecute
them." -
-: â¢ "I; don't know whether, your proposal
is acceptable or not,"- said his > Honor.
"These men were- attending -to their
work when 5 the old man^ 'butted \ in,
and then. - while . they i were reproving
him, you 'butted in.' If the defendants
had been let alone by you and the mys
terious ancient" who: preceded 'you -In
â¢butting in' ; your : nose would be unin
jured and there would be'nofcourt pro
ceedings. However I'll take Vmr sug

continued to-day before Secretary Taft.
Henry Unwln of New York, formerly
connected with the asphalt company,
was a witness and several newspaper
men were called by Bowen and ques
tioned as to the ethics of their profes
sion regarding communications and
confidences from public men.
Unwln was asked concerning the al
leged check which has figured in the
contro\*ersy. He remembered having
seen such a check, but did not know
of his own knowledge for whom it was
Intended. He was able, however, to
give Secretary Taft the names of cer
tain officials connected with the asphalt
company, whom Taft has summoned.
These are Atkinson. Huntington and
Cartland of the asphalt company. In
addition. Secretary Taft also has sent
a representative to interview John
Mack of the asphalt company In Phil
adelphia, who has promised to produce
the bank book of the company, and, if
possible, the check said, to have been
exchanged. â¢ -
It is not expected that any further
proceedings will be taken during the

MEAGEK INFORMATION
FORMER PRESIDENT OF GUATEMALA AND ALLEGED CONSPIRATOR
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF. CABRERA. WHO IS AT . THE PALACE
HOTEL. HAVING ARRIVED YESTERDAY FROM MEXICO.
He announced that he did. not desire to
be President and to prove this fact he
named three prominent countrymen, any
one of whom, he said, he would favor for
trie position. One of these was the pres
ent Guatemalan Consul General .to the
City of Mexico who is a close friend of
President Diaz ana It is 'suspected that
this friendship, together with ' tha pros-
It was not Barill-!** ambition to be
come the President of Guatemala again,
for he keenly appreciated the fact that
he Is well advanced in years and has
many political enemies in his country who
would never permit him to assume the
reins of government. Besides this the
foreign element is anxious for peace. It
was- the general's claim that his plans
for deposing Cabrera were the outgrowth
of a personal desire on his part to render
the people of Guatemala a lasting serv
ice. When he retired \u25a0 from office many
years ago Barillas publicly declared that
be would never favor perpetuating the
term of the President.
It is claimed that shortly before the
first term of President Cabrera expired,
the latter began scheming to have the
period of the Presidential term length
ened two years, and this fact angered
Barillas, who immediately proceeded to
organize a revolution, and when he real
ized that he was being watched he quiet
ly slipped over the border into Mexico,
where he was later Joined by his follow
ers at Tapachula. !
Meanwhile the Guatemala Congress met
and passed an act extending the Presi
dent's term,, and then Barillas issued a
proclamation declaring bitter enmity for
Cabrera.
\OT SEEKIXG PRESIDENCY.
General Barillas in a proclamation is
sued cix months ago announced that he
would Invade Guatemala before President
Cabrera was re-elected, but the election
was effected without interference from
the revolutionists. Later it was reported
that Barflies would cross the borders
with his forces before Cabrera was in
augurated two months ago, but again he
disappointed the people of Guatemala.
Apparently he was not receiving the
support from the people of Guatemala
that he had expected, and evidently Pres
ident Diaz of Mexico arrived at the con
clusion that the revolution would not
materialize, for several weeks ago he un
expectedly ordered Barillas and his mili
tary leaders out of Tapachula and in
structed them to report at once to the
City of Mexico, where he could keep a
closer watch upon them.
The last that had be.en heard of Barillas
was that he had arrived in the Mexican
capital and was still confiding to his
friends that he had not given up his
plans for deposing. President Cabrera.
Naturally his countrymen in this city were
greatly surprised yesterday when the
news was spread about the Latin quarter
that the general and several of his fol
lowers had quietly slipped into San Fran
cisco. General Barillas can never hope
to return to Guatemala so long as Presi
dent Cabrera is the ruler of the republic,
for the latter has worn to administer the
extreme penalty in the event of -Barillas
falling Into the hands of the Guatemalan
authorities. In fact, the President long
ago hoped to capture Barillas, and when
he learned that the revolutionary general
was massing followers at Tapachula, with
a view to crossing the border. Cabrera
bo deployed his own forces on the north
ern border as to leave an opening in front
of Tapachula. through which he expected
that Barillas would make a dash and fall
Into a trap that had been set for him;
Manuel L. Barillas, former President of
Guatemala, upon whose head a price has
been placed by the present ruler of the
Central American republic, accompanied
by teveral of his followers, who have been
plotting with him to overthrow that coun
try, arrived here yesterday from the City
of Mexico and are staying at the Palace
Hotel. Ten years ago. Barilla*, then a
man of fortune and of great influence in
his own country, triumphantly entered
San Francisco and securing elaborate
apartments at the Palace, proceeded to
entertain in the lavish manner of an Ori
ental potentate. Yesterday Barillas came
to San Francisco as an ordinary traveler,
looking the part of a man fagged by the
hardships of frontier life, of which he has
had considerable experience of late. He
ordered through one of his followers sev
eral ordinary rooms and communicated to
the clerks of the hotel the fact that he
did not want to be disturbed, particularly
by newspaper meo.
The remainder cf the day Barillas re
mained within his rooms and positively
refused to see all callers, except two
countrymen, one being Juan Ojeda, who is
connected tvjth several of the prominent
families cf Guatemala.
Just what General Barillas* mission is to
San Francisco is a secret, but it is inter
preted as meaning that h,e has abandoned
the plans for a revolution in Guatemala
that lie inaugurated nearly a year ago.
For several months the general and his
party leaders have been assembled at
Tapachula Mexico, awaiting an opportu
nity to invade Guatemala from the north
simultaneously with a similar movement
from the south. It was generally sup
posed that President Diaz of Mexico and
President Regalado of Salvador were cog
nizant of the plotting going on in their
own countries against Guatemala, and
from their indifference to the presence
of Barillas' followers in their respective
territories it was suspected that they were
quietly encouraging the movement.

Mrs. Annie Pappas and Nicholas Tam

22, have been located by the police 'at 211
Fourth street, ' in - this \u25a0 city, where ."thiÂ»y
had been living as husband "and '.wife.'
Peter. Pappas', husband of theiwoman, is
proprietor of the Little Fair " restaurant
lunch at ,4302 State street, Chicago. He
was notified and came here^ -Yesterday
he swore out warrants â¢ before : Police
Judge Mogan for the arrest of the clop
ers. The -woman was arrested by De
tective Bailey and locked up .in the City
Prison. . Tarnpakes was sick inbed.The
warrant was servedupoh him and a po
liceman detailed "to watch him till he is
sufficiently . recovered |to be * removed to
prison.
Pappas and Tampakes were' friends and
the families were in the habit of fre
quently visiting: each other. Tampakes
was formerly employed in a dye 'house,
but : recently started . a fruit and confec
tionery store. ,. Pappas had ; no; suspicion
of Tampakes' designs upbn> his wife's,af
fections, and was more sorry : than angry
when they disappeared on [April- 22. Mrs.
Pappas took with her $500, had
taken ' her husband years' to 5ave.,. ...

street, but they removed to ; the ' next
block. Pappas notified the police,' and he
was informed that, the pair could ,not : ;be
arrested unless a warrant was sworn^ut,
so he came here. ; He" says that Tampakes
left a wife in a: delicate condition and
two children destitute' in Chicago.; Mrs.

Prior to this the boards of directors of
the Butte and Plumas and the Indian
Valley roads, of which H. H. Yard la
president, will meet and authorize the.
transfer of their respective rights of way
and other interests in California to the
Western Pacific, as has been already
planned by the Goulds. - These two roads
are a valuable asset, in that they furnish
the only means for the Western Pacific to
get a route from OrovUle up through the
Feather River Canyon to Quincy. The
route surveyed by Yard is the achieve
ment of one jof the most difflcult en
gineering problems that confronted tho
\7estern Pacific promoters in their
scheme to enter this State.
General Counsel Vaile, who cam* West
with- Bartnett. directly represents the
GoCTds, and it was under his direction
that a bill was recently passed by the
Colorado Legislature permitting the Rio
Grande Railroad and the â¢ Denver and
Rio Grande Railroad to indorse the bond
issue of a foreign road, an act necessary
to allow the directors of the Gould roads
in Colorado to authorize officially the in
dorsement of the Western Pacific bonds.
This was done in order to insure them
a commercial value on the market.. The
Indorsement was made in Denver last
week, and this will be followed by .a
formal approval of the bonds by the
directors of the Western Pacific at their
meeting this week. General Counsel
Vaile expects to remain here several
weeks, during which he will assist the
new general counsel of the Western Pa
cific in straightening out whatever legal
entanglements are found.
. It was stated yesterday that actual
work on the Western Pacific will begia
in a few weeks under the direction of tha
construction company Incorporated for
that purpose. Chief Engineer E. J. Yard
of the Denver and Kio Grande road has
already built a mile and a half extension
westward from the. western terminus of
that road, with the understanding that
it will eventually form part of the West
ern Pacific: While Bartnett Is here ; a
number of condemnation suit 3 for rights
of way are to be begun in the Stato
courts, and while these proceedings are
under. way the officials of the road will
be clearing the way for grading from
Oroville to Quincy and at other sections
in Nevada.
President W. J. Bartnett of the "West
ern Pacific Railroad Company, who has
been In the East for a year on business
connected with the new railroad enter
prise, returned to the city yesterday. He
was accompanied to San Francisco by
Director John Treadwell, Consulting En
gineer Virgil Bogue, Joel F. Vaile. the
general attorney for the Denver and Rio
Grande road, and H. H. Yard, president
of the Butte and Plumas and the Indian
Valley railroads, that are to form tha
nucleus of the Western Pacific in Cali
fornia.
President Bartnett has returned to this
city for the purpose of straightening out
a number of difficulties that have been
encountered by the promoters of the
Western Pacific in furthering their plans
for the early construction of the road,
and the first step in this direction will
be taken during the coming week, when
it i 3 expected that the directors wUI
meet. At this meeting it is planned that
Bartnett shall shall be superseded in the
presidency by Edward T. Jeffery. at pres
ent a vice president of the road and also
president of the Denver and Rio Grande,
and Bartnett will then be elected vice
president and general counsel.

which recalls the beautiful park residences of
other and more progressive cities whose exam-
ples -we may well follow. \u25a0' The scheme will
promote neiKhborllness based. on common Inter-
ests, and at \u25a0 the sume time the grouping of
the riouÂ«-s within the enclosure should insure
privacy and protection.' The plan teems Ideal."-
A." Sbarboro:
"I congratulate you upon the splendid scheme,
for residence plots as shown by . the . plan : of
Presidio Tenace.- I have seen similar places In.
Europe and In snme cities of the \u25a0 Eastern':
Etatet;, but I believe that Presidio Terrace will
surpass them all. The location being, adjacent
to. the Presidio, - families with, their children
can stroll at their pleasure and enjoy the beau-
tiful view -of the bay~a.nd" ocean. Tha sunny
expeeure of the trai*t cannot bo excelled. : Ac-
cept my heartiest congratulation* for the beau-
tiful . and praiseworthy - enterprise which â¢Is
sure to meet with- great favor."- .

The old sangs are best, for they carry
us back to the days that werÂ» radiant
with sentiment, when we were Dart cf
poetry and romance. They stir our.na
tures in their profoundest depths and.
reaching below the callous of our putres
eent hearts, play stranga accompaniment*
upon the long-disused strings of our re
membrance. -Who can resist the subtl*
potency of those old songs that stop thÂ»
world in tear-smiles that we may wave
a salutation back through a rift tn the
storm of years to youth and maiden
of the long ago? r
That the old songs ars best has been
ehown by -the sexennial popularity of
Patti's "Home, Sweet Home." Emma Ab
bott's "Annie Laurie," JÂ«ny " LJnd'a v
"Kathleen Mavourneen." Christina Ntel
son's "Way Down Upon the Suwana*
River." and Melba's "Coming Thro' the
Rye." We do not always associate these-
Immortal songs with the great singers
who have included them In their concerts,
but the singers are often remexnSered
because of the songs themselves. There
are few who can remember the many ac
robatic arias of the splendid vocal artists
who have commanded almost fabulous
sums for their singing. . but no one can
forget when they yielded to popular v *Â«- ,
mand for the old songa. Pattl or Sem- -
brich or Melba or Calve never had more*
sincere appreciation "j in ' the suprtmest
moments of her triumphs than when Â»hs
descended for the tlma from the classics

Ancient Order Workmen.
In the banking department is transacted
the ordinary business' of bankers. Here
other banks keep their "reserve," hence
draw their supplies as they require them.
The issue department is intrusted with
the circulation of the notes of the bank,
which is regulated as follows: The bank
in 1544 was. a creditor. of the Government
to the extent of $55,000,000, and to this
amount and $20,000,000 beyond, for which
there is in other ways; sufficient secu
rity, the bank is allowed to issue notes
without having any gold I reserve to meet
them. Beyond these $75,000,000 every note
issued represents gold actually in the cof
fers of the bank. -
All Bank of England notes are printed
in the bank Itself. Six printing presses
are In, constant operation, the same'.jna
chine printing first the particulars of
value, signature, etc., and then the num
ber'of the note in consecutive order. The
paper used . is of peculiar texture, being
at once thin, tough and crisp, and the
combination of these qualities, together
with the peculiarities of the water-mark,
which Is distributed over the whole sur
face of the paper,, forms one of -the prin
cipal guarantees- against imitation. The
paper, which is manufactured exclusively
at one particular mill. Is made" in oblong
slip*, allowing ju3t enough space for the
printing of two notes elde' by side.
NOTES NEVER REISSUED.
No note Is ever issued a second time.
When once it .finds its way back to the
bank to be exchanged for coin it. is Im
mediately, canceled.,, and", the reader will
probably be surprised -to hear that the
average life of a bank note, or the time
during which it is : in actual circulation,
is not more than five or,; six days. 'The
returned ' notes . are ":.; brought "' into . what
Is known as the accountant's sorting of
fice. Here they are examined by inspect
ors, who reject any which may be found
to be counterfeit. In such a- case the
paying-In bank ,is debited with the
amount.
' The" note's come in from various banks
in parcels,: each parcel accompanied by a
memorandum stating the number and
amount of the notes contained in it. The
memorandum I is ; marked with a certain
number and then" each note in the parcel
is " sstamperd r to i correspond, the stamping
machine automatically' registering how
many are " stamped and consequently
drawing attention to any/ deficiency in
the number of notes as compared wfth
that stated in the , memorandum. ,|
This done, the notes are sorted accord
ing to number and date, and after, being
defaced by punching out the letters Indi
cating value and tearing off the corner
bearing the signature, are passed to the
bank note library, where they are packed
In boxes and preserved for possible future
reference during a period of five years.
'The Bank of England originated in the
brain of William Paterson, a Scotchman
better known E perhaps as the organizer
and leader of the ill-fated Darien expe
dition. It commenced business in 1634, its
charterâ which was' ln. the first instance
granted for eleven -.years only â bearing
date July 27 of that year. This charter
has been from time to time renewed, the
last renewal having taken place in 1844. ,
The original capital -of the bank was
but JG.OOV.uOO, and It carried on its busi
ness in a single room in Mercer's Hall,
with a staff of fifty- four clerks. From Â«o
small a beginning has grown the present
gigantic establishment, which covers
nearly three acres. , ;: â¢\u25a0\u25a0â¢â¢"
BIG ' Ji uTES ISSUES.
Considering the world-wide reputation
of the Bank of England, it is remarkable
how little is generally known as to its
internal "workings. - Standing in the very
heart of the largest city^ in the worldâ
a central-landmark of the great metropo
lisâeven .the busy Londoners around ,it
have, as a rule, only the vaguest possible
kr.owledg* of what^ goes .on within its
walls.. In truth, its functions are bo
many, its staff so enormous and their du
ties so varied that many . even of those
who have spent their lives in Its service
will tell you that beyond their own imme
diate departments they know but little of
its inner life, /v / '\u25a0'\u25a0
The poatmarkuppn the.package con

blurred.- Some .of ; the; clerks inv^the

A few days after the receipt \u0084of, this
letter, or, to be, acciiiwite, on March 14,
a somewhat larger contribution to \u25a0the
"conscience ? fund"/ came in" the ; mail jto
the Secretary. : The rriissiye 'which ac-j
companied the .cash did- not tell how
the money was , taken , originally from

On February 26 J last* Secretary Shaw
found In": his morning's mail a" letter
containing, ls cents. It read as follows:
:\u25a0! "Inclosed you will find 15 cents, which
I send to pay ; . for; two slate pencils
which I believe I took from an Indian
agency located at that time at % Coito-n,
Cal> This was done when I was a small
boy about 16 -years: old, or something
near it. It probably : was. mere .than
that. - liSent the moneys to 'the Indian
agency '\u25a0\u25a0 at Ban Jacinto, Cal., but It /was
sent back ' to ! me. V; I do this beca use I
believe it is God's â¢ will. s I hope you
will ' dispose of . the ; amc-unt so . that "; it
will go , to the proper ; place." . C-^y
\u25a0:.' A. \u25a0:.SINJfER'S REFUXD. ;
If you ask a treasury offlciar for the
office of the "conscience fund" >he will
smile and say: "Go to the public mon
eys | division." At the public,' moneys
division you- will be told that there is
no such thing as the "conscience .fund,"
but that the money received from; the
owners of ; troublesome consciences is
turned into the general treasury under
the .head of "miscellaneous â¢ receipts."
For â¢ the, sake of accuracy./ and ) also to
help along the wholesome fiction, a rec
ord Is .kept of every, cent thus received,
and as long as the Treasury; Depart
ment keeps a set. erf^ books entries will
be", made of such contributions under
the "conscience fund" caption, m Presi
dent Madison . received Tin .1811 j a ( sum
of money from some repentant^ sinner
who wished to make restitution of stol
-*n money. Then and 'there thie fund
was started and it has been in mythi
cal existence . ever since. 83 No : sum vis
too large*orrtoo small'for' entry in the
record. . Just as much pains are, taken
with the three /stamps that some
schoolboy 'sends to make peace with
his inner self as- with \u25a0 the fat roll of
bank notes â¢ 6ome" 'wealthy importer
sends : to "silence the" "still, small voice"
within his portly breast.. "? rv
As soon' as money for the "conscience
fund" is. received at' -the Treasury De
partment .Secretary ; Shaw orders ; a lit
tle item placed upon the bulletin board
; in. his outer office, g The newspaper cor
respondents, who go the rounds of the
various offices in the treasury build
ing, Invariably make note; of the case
and , thus j the newis ' of a good example
is sent broadcast ' to" the world.
"A guilty conscience needs no ac
cusei-" is^aq adage that, is not believed
by officials of the Treasury Department.
They are orthe opinion that the guilty
conscience does need a little^ proddinK
once in a while to cause \u25a0 the owner to
repent and make amends. As proof
oÂ£ this-contention they point with pride
to the so-called "conscience fund."
which within the last century has gath
ered in nearly 5500,000 for, the^ Gdvern
hient's pocketbook. But^for ; the fact
that this mythical "fund" has been re
ferred to from rtime to time : in the
newspapers,' the believe,
scarcely one -tenth -of the huge sum
mentioned would have j been sent to the
treasury.' The frequent .printing: f of
the mere words "conscience fund" is an
accusation to , every person who at
some period in his life has defrauded
Uncle Sam. .The constant appearance
of dispatches from Washington' giving
accounts -of unknown - persons ; in vari-;
ouÂ» parts of the country sending "con
science contributions" to the Secretary
of the Treasury is the most 'eloquent of
invitations* to other guilty ones to "pay
up and make your peace ; with \u25a0. your
conscience . and your country." ' - : .
The person who sends the amount of
his debt tothe "conscience fund" learns
that., no effort will be made by the
authorities- to discover his or her iden
tity or to exact punishment for the
original crime. He feels that by thus
making restitution he will not only be
forgiven for, his . former ! misdeeds I but
will be able, to look the world in the
face once more, sleep better and get
more enjoyment out of life. He is
right in cherishing these beliefs, for the
Government officials will make no at
tempt to resurrect his past, and there
is no doubt whatever that his own
conscience will, reward him for doinsr
the square thing. .

The market opened quiet and steady, one

uull. There was no pressure, but shorts were
covering a little rather than carry, their cotton
over Sunday. The. opinion 1 seems pretty, well
mixed .aa to what course *to I pursue.' 1 There
were rumors. that a bull; pool -has been foi-med
to .operate in all â¢ the markets, headed by.'a
former bull leaaer who is ' now 'in 'Liverpool.'

day 'B . more - favorable Gox'ernment report than
was- expected; -was carried too far by . the bear
element In their anxiety sto fores prices down
too .rapidly. -It was; the continuation ; of ag
gressive i operations and "â¢ forced - liquidation by
scattered weak' holders -vhich made the market
appear so . heavy . early in; the -week, -and senti

down. -The recovery seems 'a, little too rapid
and., due mostly to | forced covering ! of ' shorts,'
who oversold themselves on the break," and un
less supported . by concerted action among the

Tlie report of G. N. Salisbury, Section Di
rector, United States Weather Bureau, for the
Washington Crop Bulletin, week ended June <5:
According to the jreneral concensus of re
' port*, the past week was the best growing one
of the season. For the most part the nights,
as well as day<% were warm, and there were
frequent copious rains, which were unusually
heavy in many localities, thoroughly soaking
the soil. They were of great benefit, espe
cially on the uplands, to all grains, grasses
and vegetables.
Fall wheat is heading out in fine condition,
but in some localities it is rank in growth,
rendering it very liable to lodge in heavy
rains or winds. Spring wheat is growing lux
uriantly, wtll Ftooled, has a good color and is
now *'ln the boot." There is enough moisture
now present in the soil of the eastern counties
to mature an abundant wheat crop. -The only
uncertainty lies in the character of the
weather during the blooming and filling
stages. Should there then be an absence of
hot winds a splendid crop of wheat will be
matured.
Oats have progressed rapidly. On lowlands. .
like the Olympla and Swinomish flats, there
has been a. little too much moisture. Pota
toes and other vegetables are now growing
v*ry fast as a result of warmth and moleture.
Â«>>rn is coming up well. Hops ar* said to be
uneven: mny hills are missing. Pastures and
meadows arc now luxuriant. In some locali
ties-the clover crop will be short where it was
badly killed out by drought last year.

Currants and Citrus " goods i were firm, stocks
being comparatively light, but all deciduous
varieties, save . Figs, .were' weak at low and
irregular rates owing. to the abundance of low
grade fruit, which had a depressing \u25a0 effect
on the sale of good stock. Plums, Peaches and
Apricots', in large ' open - boxes \u25a0 were offering
freely, but ' found : few buyers, as the "offerings

from that quarter, and sold at $2 per drawer.

weak, particularly Strawberries, and offerings
had to be strictly fancy, to command the out

The Prune market continues strong, with
conditions steadily growing firmer. From re
ports received from Western Oregon the Wll
lamette. Valley Prune Association concludes
that what looked a few weeks ago like a third
or a half of a crop of Prunes has -dwindled
to not more than one-fourth of an average
crop and that" Indications are that it will fall
below that estimate before the fruit matures.
Unless the weather Is more favorable in the
futures than it has been in the past, it Is
thought, that the crop in some sections will
not be worth harvesting. Secretary Jenks esti
mates the total yield at not to exceed 0,000.000
pounds, against an- average yield of about
30 CCO, OOO The condition of the European
crops is thus indicated: French, fair; Servia
and Bosnia, reduced by about 30 or 40 per
cent from previous estimates by ravage* of in
sects and other troubles. The shortage In the
California crop Is too well known to need any
further affirmation: The whole situation is
one of Increasing firmness. , - - %

Uncle is enjoyingr more of the real old
prosperity this week at Recreation Park
than he ever had in hi* life before. They
are just handing it out to him' in bunches
as big as his bonnet; J Yesterday was the
fifth without a hesitation. It was a pres
ent from Mr." Kelly and other members
of the ! Oakland team, and it came" in
handy. Scoreâ San ; Francisco 12, Oak
land 2. ':';\u25a0*\u25a0-\u25a0-\u25a0"\u25a0\u25a0:>. . .:-\u25a0 -\u25a0 v --:- ;
As usual, It all happened in one. lnning.
That in the way Oakland is always get
ting ( beaten. . Just as S soon as Kelly made
a dummy play, by^throwlngi to the 'plate
instead of tagging th 6 runner at'secohd,
antl letting a bunch of runs through, \ the
whole, team \u25a0 said good-night and proceed
ed to ; lay down. V The Seals hammered in
enough runs to hold. them for a. week.
The fourth tells â¢ the sad little tale.'
Spencer opened with a hit. but was faded
trying to steal. .Waldron; could. not make
good, but Wheeler swung -through, and
then a little fun was on the menu. Irwin
bingled and ! so did Nealon. That meant
a run, andwhen the ball began to get
hit lively the j Commuters went skyward.
Lohman winged to second and had. Neal
on ' a mile, ' but Kelly, insisted \ on winging
the ball to* the plate, . even ; though two
had been chased. Hoganltook the^hrow
and dropped * It. > That ' finished \ the Com
muters for the day.; r~- ? - . .<; .-â¢.-'
:.".' When: the game had been cinched Hank
took Whalen out of , the' box to save ; him
for this /afternoon. .' Wheeler, went Jnto
action, Spencer v took up ; the; burden w at
second and Williams \ trotted out: to if the,
right garden.;' Tha t; combination- worked
quite as well as the former,, for 'the Com
muters secured 3no i more s runs, ,whlle \the
Seals made just as many as. they wanted.
\u25a0 Oakland ' started - off 4 the .j game ; well.
After two* had been stowed away; in the
first Dunleavyri dtrelb, ; Kelly ' and -; Deve
reaux chopped; out good } ones, scoring ; a
pair of tallies: in -jig time", and giving -the
Commuters a leadvwhlch looked good. > - ',
Up to ! the '\u25a0 time of ; the - disaster, young
Hogan pitched good. enough ball to go: in
any ' man's lfeague/ It; was not his; fault
that the crash came, Uhough ho did keep
the ball a little 1 too j muih iin > the grove
when < thef Seals .got r their batting eye 3
f ocused 1 on the 'leather. ;..-,
Old Peter Lohman : , was not .; quite \u25a0_, as
good : as he \u25a0 uscd^to rbe behind .the; bat.

The Supreme Court decided yester
day that Getz Bros. & Co. could not re
cover *1 0,000 from the Federal Salt
Cdmpany. "the salt trust." on two
checks drawn December IS. 1901. The
plaintiff claimed that the money was
due in payment for salt delivered to
the defendant, but the court thinks
that the checks were given to further
the operations of the Federal Salt Com
pany, which was dissolved for violating
the provisions of the Sherman anti
trust act. It is held that to order the
payment of the $10,000 in dispute would
be contrary to public policy. The court
also decided that Ole Olsen was entitled
to damages from George D. Gray & Co.
for personal injuries sustained by him
while ln.thÂ« employ of the defendant

Subordinate of the Odd Fellows Given
Evening of Entertainment, Many
L.adlÂ«>Â» Being: Present. - ;
Golden West Lodge No. 322 of the
Independent Order of Odd Fellows had
a banquet in the Lick House last night
in celebration of the twentieth anniver
sary of its institution. It was a mem
orable fraternal and social event in the
history of this very progressive lodge,
for there were seated at the flower
dpcorated tables more than 20Â« persons,
of whom more than one-third were
ladies. At the head of the table there
were D. A. Hemphill. noble grand of
the lodge, who was the toastmaster
of the evening, and on either side were
the following named, with ladies: A.
I>onald, vice grand; W. H. Hidell, jun
ior past grand; W. C. McLane, record
ing secretary; W. H. Manuell, financial
secretary, and F. R. Parker, treasurer,
also the following members of the ban
quet committee; John Hazlett. L. W.
Clarke. E. D. Knight and J. H. Thrane.
A most delicious supper was dis
cussed and at the termination thereof
the toastmaster called upon W. A. S.
Nicholson. P. N. G., to respond to
"Golden West Lodge," which he did
by giving a very interesting review of
the risp and progress of the lodge.
Frank Thompson then favored with a
bass 6010. Miss J. Hazell entertained
with a select reading, E. D. Knight
toasted. "The Ladies." and this was re
sponded to in a pleasing speech by
Miss Josephine Walworth, deputy of
District No. S of the Rebekahs. Dr.
Compton amused the assemblage- with
neat sleight of hand tricks, after which
Miss Greader gave a recitation. Wal
ter Neat Brunt told of the events of
the evening in impromptu jingle, which
was provocative of much laughter.
Tiiere were also other songs and in
strumental numbers, which helped to
make the evening one of the most
pleasant that has been given by a lodge
of this order this year.
GOLDEX WEST LODGE
E.VJOYS A BA.VQUET
Shattered in health and scarcely able to
totter, Mrs. Louise Worthington. the con
victed murderess of Henry Baddeley. was
relea&ed from San Quentin on parole
yesterday. When she was taken to the
prison over eight years ago sheÂ« was a
comely woman; when she left it yester r
day she was a pitiful, decrepit 'wreck.
Eight years', separation from her chil
dren, one of whom was born in the shad
ow of the prison, and her husband have
broken her spirit.
Mrs. Louise Worthisigton shot and
killed Henry Baddeley on the Jackson
street wharf on May 2. IS&S. Baddeley
had been paying her marked attention
and her husband reproached her with it.
She shot him. it was said, at the instiga
tion of her husband.
Mrs. Worthington was sentenced to
twenty-five years on a charge of murder
in the second degree. A determined effort
was made to save her. The best legal
talent was secured to her and in all she
was given four trials, but in the end
Judge Wallace decreed that she must
serve the original sentence. %
\u25a0While she was in the prison, a third
child was born to her. She was already
mother of two. The little one was left
.with her for a while, but later taken :
" away.
For all the long years theWoraan re
mained in the prison, praying that she
would some day bo able to see all her
children again. But she grew weaker day
by day and she began to give up hope.
During the last few months she showed
symptoms of locomotor ataxia.
At the meeting of the prison directors
yesterday it was decided to parole her.
When the news was told to her she was
elmost insane with joy. At 5 yesterday
afternoon she staggered out cf the place
â¢ that had sapped her womanhood and ;
crushed her spirit- Miss S. Fry. secretary
of the San Francisco Bene\'olent Society,
accompanied her. Mrs. Worthington will
Eoon join her husband and three children
in the East. They have been waiting and
longing for her release. She will prob
ably leave here to-morrow.
