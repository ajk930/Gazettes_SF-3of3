there the 9 .o'clock . train to Portland,

for the? past " r two years. He knew all

in ;the veryj same automobile on , Its re

CLEVELAND, July' Itâ Frank Rocke

bell's story of r his father's life, printed
to a current magazine, as a lie: says thÂ« -
truth will be known and suggests that
the family may take action to protect
the name and honor of his father. '
Miss Tarbell had pictured the elder
Rockefeller as a convivial quack â¢ doctor
and wandering merchant, well known to
the taverns and an associate of " horse
thieves. ' Frank Rockefeller was bitterly
indignant when ha read the article and
has been in communication with his
father regarding it. His. father. does not
want any. statement made In the matter
now and will preserve his seclusion In
the west, but Is planning action to clear
his name.
"I can't discuss the Corrigan matter."
said Frank Rockefeller. "Corrigan la the
best friend I ever had. It is a matter
for discussion between my brother, John
D., Corrigan and TarbelL Let them have -
it. But part of the Tarbell story about
my father was a lie. It. does a. mon
strous , wrong. 1 will not tell - the true
story now. I will not tell .where. father â¢
Is, but I know positively that he will not
talk." f^
CORROBORATES MISS TARBELL.
James Corrigan, , in referring to a for
mal statement issued by Attorney Virgil -
P. Kline ; in defense of John D. Rocke
feller, says that " the statements In Ida V
M. Tarbell's magazine article were accu
rate.
â¢That account of Miss Tarbell's was
about right, including > the Insinuations,"
said Corrigan. ."The case Is really worse
than she put- it. In fact, -it Is worse
than -any; one has put It. Legally,, I snp-_.
pose he. got that case; morally, he was
not entitled to it. -.^BBBHRHIIMB
"Miss Tarbell's Information ; was ob
tained partly from . papers ' held by
Judge Burke, but I did not know ; she
had them until a little while before the
story, was published. : I \u25a0 have . no doubt
she : had every authority . for , her , state
ment. 1 should say the story was about
right as far as It goes, but there was a
great deal that might have been said
besides. At any rata ths story ij not
misleading. BBMBHO

two years after the contract was made
with Mr. Rockefeller before I filed a '

are you going?' I asked her. 'Never mind,'
ehe said to me, "it may be better that you
do net know, then you wiJl keep out of
trouble.
"On the stcarmr she was constantly
afraid that some one wouid recognize her
and that she would be stopped. I com
forted her as best I could and we finally
KOt to the Oakland shore.
"Ehe had no Pullman ticket, but we
walked up to the Pullman car conductor.
He to!d her that she would have to go
\u25a0econd class.
"'I wont so that way,' she said. 'I
want a drawing-room.' "
â¢'I reasoned with her and told her that
she must go the best waj' she could.
" "Oh,' s?he said. 'I am so nervous that
I don"t know what I am doing.'
"She boarded the Portland special and
I bade ivr good-by. Then I returned to
the city. No one has asked me about the
trip and 1 have told no one.
*'I don't believe that she will join Mr.
Collins, if he can help it. I think that
he Is tired of her and wants to ship her.
I know that he did not love his new
mnthrr-in-iaw us dearly as many think.
"That was the last that I saw of Mrs.
McCurdy. She gave me the bill of sale
for the office furniture, which Mr. Col
lins had made cut for her and told me
to give it to Kington. She kept repeat
ing that she was going away to escape
the grilling of the cross-examiners and
that she would return to San Francisco
to Fettle up her business. "
Mrs. McCurdy. by her flight, acted as
an escaping witness and is in contempt
of court. For this offense the punlsh
nunt is either fine or imprisonment. It
le Bkfly to go hard with her if she is
caught. In the meantime the police are
looking for her and they have sent tele
grams of description all over the country.
COLLIXS TO BE BROUGHT BACK.
Officer Will Be Soot to Victoria for the
Blgramous Attorney.
The arrest of George D. Collins at
Victoria on a charge of perjury means
that the local authorities are deter
mined to punish the bigamous attorney
if such a thing is possible. An officer
will probably be sent to Victoria to
bring back the prisoner as soon as the
necessary papers can be prepared.
District Attorney Bylngton is deter
mined that Collins shall be tried in this
city and will leave no stone unturned
to accomplish his conviction.
But the fact that he will be brought
back to this country on the charge of
perjury does not mean that he can be
held for the trial instituted against
him for the illegal marriage to Clarice
HcCurdy. Unless he voluntarily gives
himself up, or wanders Into the United
Suites of his own accord and is then
arrested, he will never be tried for big
amy in the State of California. The
law provides expressly that where a
fugitive is brought from another coun
try by means of extradition papers, he
can only be tried for the offense which
Is expressly named in that document.
He 'cAimot be brought back on this
charge of perjury, tried, and then held
for the crime for which he dared not
â¢tanri trial.
Byintrton is enraged over the escape
of the prisoner. "I will have George
D. Collins back here if there Is any
means under the sun to bring him
back." he said. "I do not believe in al
lowing a criminal to escape from the
law which is made to protect us with
out exhausting every effort to bring
him to justice, Mark my word, I will
have that man back, and before
a very long time, either. I am sure
from the information given out in yes
terday morning's Call that he is In
Canada and as soou as I receive pri
vate information from the police I will
attend to his case in a very vigorous
"manner. I will go straight to the Gov
ernor and request him to Issue a de
mand for CollinÃ from the Canadian
Government on the charge of perjury.
Then we will swear out a. new warrant
for his arrest, notify the police up there
to hold him and with the papers for

Collins" QiiallGfationn Will !Vnt Avail
K!m ; In itrltUb Tcrrltorr.
Collins must gain a livelihood from
â¢some other vocation than that of the law
if he remains in Canada. The following
communication explains the obstacles be
fore him:
To the Editor of The Call: I Infer
from some expressions used or quoted in
this morning's Call as to the professional
opportunities of Georjre D. Collins in
Canada that you, like most of my friends
end professional brethren, have mlsun
* dcrstood the requirements of the Cana
dian law as to applicants for admission
lo the bar. Neither the British nor the
â¢ Canadian courts lecognlze admissions or
jcertiflcates to practice law given in other
states or countries. The standards of re
quirements are wholly different.
If Collins be <as the attorney whom you
quote says) "one of the smartest lawyers
in the world," It will avail him nothing
as a passport to the profession In Can
ada. Whether he seeks to enter the up
per or the lower branch of the profes
sionâthat 5s to cay. whether as barris
ter or attorney, he must go through the
prescribed course of legal education and
examination, and afford the prescribed
evident^ of learning and moral charac
ter.
"Smartness" and learning are not
words of identical meaning, and it is the
latter, not the fdrmer, that is the test
1 there. Three years is the minimum pe
riod over which the course of study and
examination must extend, and even that
is possible only to university graduates.
To all others the minimum period is live
>esre, and until the whole course of
study is completed, a succession of ex
aminations passed, and satisfactory evi
dnce at moral character, received, a can
didate cannot bo heard as an advocate
in any British or Canadian court, what:
ever his reputation lor "smartness" else
where. ICS&PiPBfSfBKBpHBi3SS9@9KBf
Mr. Collins will have .to pursue his
w*mderi!!SB a good deal farther before he
can exhibit his "smartness" In a British
or Canadian court, -Besides which, that
kind of smartness does not stand for
much in the criminal courts of those
countries. For merely technical. objec :
tions there is but little show. The pow
er* of amendment "before.-!- duringi-or
after" a criminal .trial render technical
AtUections of little avail, unless they go
to the merits, or morals, of the charge,
for the usual answer of â¢ the court is
"leave to amend," and, in fact, to amend
there. anfi then. So Mr. Collins' prowess
as a* criminal lawyer will be of little
value to him in Canada, or in any British
dependency. , -
I have repeatedly suggested such an
amendment of our penal code here as
tvould avoid the technical objections
which so often result in the miscarriage
of justice, but thus far the suggestions
have been unavailing, and the technical
criminal lawyer is still accounted 'the
"smaitest" of men. Your 'most respect
fully. R. DIGBY JOHNSTON. LL.D.

Canadians Resent Insulting
Remark Made by an
American.
LONDON, Ontario, July 12.â An Ameri
can flag was torn down in front of the
City Hall and trampled under a hundred
fâ¬â¬t to-night, as the result of a remark
made by an American ' visitor at the
Orangemen's demonstration. ,
About 800 Americans came over from
Michigan and during the day carried the
Stars and Stripes through the streets,
without unfavorable comment being ex
cited. To-night the Americans gathered
in front of a hotel, when some on cried:
"To hell with Canada! She never showed
us yet!"
Instantly the American flag, owned by
the Port Huron (Mich.) lodge, was torn
from where It waved in the breeze and
was -ripped Into shreds and trampled un
der the feet of an angry mob. The Port
Huron Orangemen say they did not resent
it, as they believed the insult to Canada
was uncalled for.

LOS ANGELES, July 12. â The j Los
Angeles- Chamber, of Commerce has
"taken action looking to the ameliora
tion of the conditions on the deserts of
Southern California and Nevada, which
are again- -causing the deaths from
thirst of many prospectors and trav
elers. The chamber has twice before
memorialized the various county gov
ernments in which these deserts are
located in.an. an effort to , save the lives
of travelers, but so far there- has been
no action looking to' relief. ' As\ the
heated season approaches, deaths on the
desert are again becoming frequent,
and within *tfteÂ«pastÂ»twpÂ£weeks i it ;is
stated upwaref* of ''ten- peopfe have per

K.em counties, 'in Calif orna, and Lin
coln. Nye and^Esmeralda' counties,' in
Nevada, calling attention to the fatal
conditions on the desert and the pre

remedies provided. Sign posts- and maps
were suggested as remedies.

miner, is the latest vlctlm'of the desert.
He "left the O. K. mine in Dale district
on July 3 and yesterday his corpse was
found and buried where two desert roads

Mecca. Riley was accompanied on his
trip from the mines to Mecca by James
Kitte, another miner."' They started for
a sixty-mile walk with only a gallon of
water between them. :' Twelve miles out
Kitte became sick and went, back to a
water barrel and laid down until he re
covered sufficiently 4 to return to camp.
Rlley's tracks indicate that he traveled
for fifty miles, a large part of the time
in search of Cottoriwpod Springs, where
he knew there was water.- There were
no sign boards on the road and finally,
giving up in despair, he } lay down \u25a0 and
died of thirst.

noon between' tlm President and two of
the most important-leaders 'of organ
ized - labor,* -feamu el ; of ' Wash-"
ington and- James Duncan of -Qulncy,
Mass., respectively the president V;arid
one of. the' vice presidents of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor. The confer
ence -was devoted particularly to-a
Consideration of . the order recently, is
sued by" the President : regarding the
enforcement of 'tbeV Chinese exclusion
law.. An impression had been gained
by many ; members of labor organiza
tions that; the order, to an extent '.,ixi
least, let down immigration bars so far
as Chinese are concerned. The Prepi
df-nt assured his callers, however, that
.no such construction properly could -b^
placed on; the' order, and that he -was
just as -vigorously opposed to the' ad
mission :to this /country of Chinese
coolies as they,could be. V
Gompirs urged, upon the 1 President
the desirability tor an Intelligent; prac
tical and humane consideration of the
general question of immigration by the
people and. by -Congress.v The people ot
this country and of the whole civilized
world arm entitled, he maintained, to
such a consideration of tho problem.
After the conference Gompers said:
" v\e directed the President's attention to the
interpretation p.aced by som c persons .on his
recent -order, issued at the Instance or the
American Asiatic Association, concerning the
admission^ to tho United States of Chinese.
By many;of our. people and by many Chinese
that oraer was -looked upon as a letting down
of the immigration bars so tar' as the Chinese
are concerned. \ The President assured us that
no proper reading of the order would warrant
6ucn an Interpretation and that â¢ nothing was
further from hia Intention than that such an
impression should be got from the order.
His determinate is that both, skilled and
unskilled - Chinese laborers shall be excluded
from the United States and he says the law
will be rljrtdly enforced.
His order related only to the so-called ex
empt classes, merchants, students, travelers
and the like, who heretofore have had dif
ficulty In gaining admission to this country
because '.of the :â¢"\u25a0 many fraudulent â¢' certificates
issued to them . and to â¢ coolies ? who are - not
entitled to certificates in any event. \ -We went
over the entire â¢ matter thoroughly, the con
ference being perfectly satisfactory to us.
The : President I suggested- thai. In. the course
of five or six months we again trifcg. the mat~
ter to his attention In tfie light*. of 'the 'ex
perience of that length of time in 'working
under tbe order. '\u25a0"'\u25a0. \u25a0
The President says he was determined | that
the .diplomatic and consular "representatives of
the v Un!ted States \n China 1 ? should perform
their; duties>_thcroughly and- impartially , and
that* the : law, as to the Issuance of certificates
to members, of the '<\u25a0 exempt Chinese classes
should be complied with absolutely. He added
that any officer of . the United g States ;' who
issued a false certificate would lose his official
head the instant his ; misconduct was.: dis
covered. \u25a0 '\u25a0: y- ."-\u25a0- : :-. ; â¢â¢ .. â¢--:\u25a0\u25a0
We also considered with the '\u25a0> President the
eight-hour law and the difficulties - which we
had encountered In securing . Its : enforcement
ou Government work. : We instanced viola
tions of the law and requested him to : con
sider them. He asked us. to present .the facts
in a formal document, he refusing- to take up
the subject at once..- Meantime: he expressed
himself as being In " entire sympathy with ' the
law and \u25a0 Insisted that \it must be observed.
We pointed out to him * that ' officers \u25a0of â¢ the
War Department, under .. whose direction . much
Government work ) Is done, ;. were not Inclined
to insist upon , an ' observance of the law and
many of them had declined to .regard It as
their duty to bring suit.,: to -compel Its en

THE CANAL
Mr. Roosevelt, in Addressing
Physicians at Oyster Bay.
Scores Critics Who Say
Work Will Be a Failure
DECLARES IT WILL
BE A BIG SUCCESS
Says Only a Strong Nation
Could Undertake Such a
Task and Only the Timid
Doubt Its Practicability
Spec!*! Dispatch to The Call.
OYSTER BAY, July 12. â President
Roosevelt this afternoon. In addressing
the Association of Physicians of Long
Island at Oyster Bay, referred to the
Panama canal question. Among other
things, he said:
"Tlie dIKKInK of the Panama canal is
a task tbat could only be undertaken
by a Ktronsr nation.
"Many alarmlcs reports have been
corrrnt In . any battle there are al
wayÂ» ia the rear a number of iucc who
-re glad not to be In tho front, and
trho Justify themselves by telling start
ling: stories of disaster.
"Naturally they make a great deal
more noise than those who stay at the
front and do more Trorlt and do It well.
"There are excellent but timid men
of little faith who say the cr.ua! will
be a failure. It will not be a failure.
It will be a ereat success."
The President delivered a notable ad
dress. He discussed in the course of
his speech the relations physicians sus
tain with the people of the communiti.es
In which they reside and the work to
be done by the medical experts in
connection with* the construction of the
Pamana canal. He referred to the
achievements of the sanitary engineers,
â¢who cleaned the cities of Cuba for the
first time in 400 years, and closed by
raying a tribute to the services of
General Leonard Wood, whose career
as a military officer, he said, was flouted
by some critics because he euce had
been a doctor.
A majority of the 400 physicians in
attendance reached Oyster Bay on a
â¢special train at 3 o'clock. AtUred in a
suit of rough linen and" weiring a
broad-brimmed Panama hat, the Presi
dent arrived at the Oyster Bay High
School, where the meeting \u25a0was held,
at 3:15 p. m. He was escorted to the
assembly hall, where he was accorded
a cordial reception by the physicians,
ell standing: At the conclusion of the
President's. address and at Mr. Roose
velt's ors. suggestion,, an informal re
ception was held, each member of the
association being presented to the Pres
ident. After the President had retired
from - the hall /the association unani
mously elected -him and General Leon
ard Wood lumorary members of the so
ciety.
The President in his address said:
It Is needless to say that there is not and
cannot be any other profession the members of
v. hi.-h occupy euch a duai position, each side
cf which is of such importance, for the doctor
has on the one hand to be the most thoroughly
educated man In applied science that there is
la the country, and, on the other hand, aa
every layman knows, and doubtless many a
layman in the circle of acquaintance of each
cf you would gladly testify, the doctor grad
ually becomes the closest friend to more fiit
ferent people than would be possible in any
other profession. The feelings that a man has
toward the cne human being to whom he turns,
cither in time cf elckness for himself, or, what
is more Important, in the time of sicknese of
those closest and dearest to him, cannot be of
a peculiar kind. He cannot but have Â« feeling
for him euch as he has for no other man. The
doctor must, therefore, to the greatest depree
develop both sides of his nature, develop his
nature alone the two tides If his duties, al
though In the casÂ« of any other man you would
call him a mighty good citizen If he developed
only one tide.
The scientific eaa who Is really a first-class
scientific man has a claim on the gratitude of
fill the country- The man who is the nm-class
neighbor and Is always called in In time of
trouble by his neighbors has an equal claim
upon society at large. But the doctor has both
claims. Yet. In addition to filling both of these
functions, he may fill many other functions.
Ho may have served in the Civil War, he may
hare rendered the greatest possible service to
the community along a dozen different lines, j
Take, for instance, just what is being done In
oce of the great works of this country at the
present time â digging the Panama canal. That
Is a work that only & big nation could ander
.talce or that a big nation could do, and is a
work for all mankind. And the condition pi-e
cedent upon success In that work Is having the
proper type of medical work as a preliminary.
CO3TDITIOX OP SUCCESS.
That la the first condition upon the meeting
of which depends our success In aolvin* the
engineering and administrative problem* of the
vrork itself. I am happy to cay that the work
"} being admirably dene, and I am particularly
'.' ad to have 'the chance of saying It. Now
tnd thea some alarmist report will com* from
Panama. Just a couple of weeks ago there
seemed to be a succession of people coming up
from Panama, each one or whom had some
tale or other to- tell. You will always find In
any battle, even If It Is a victory, that In the
rear you meet a number of gentlemen who are
glad that they are not at tha front, who. If
they have unfortunately rot at the front, have
come away and who Justify their absence front
the front fay telling tales of how everything baa
rone wrong there
Xow tbe people who flee from Panama will
carry up here just each stories as the people
who flee from the front of a battle carry
to the rear with them. The people to wtiom
Uils country owes the most are th* ones who
nay down there and do not talk but do their
work, tend do It well. Of course; in doing a
great work like that In the tropics. In .a
region which until this Government took hold
of it, usj accounted to be a region excep
tionally unhealthy. wÂ« are going to have trou
ble, hayÂ« eoroe yellow fever, have a good deal
' f malarial lever and suffer more from the
tatter than Irom the yellow fever, although
we win hÂ«ar nothing like the talk about It.
We will have every now and then troubles
as rt-gards hygiene, Just as we will have
trouble in the engineering problems. Just as
occas'or.ally we will have trouble la the ad
ministrative work. Whenever one of these
troubier corr.es there will be a large number
ot exc-llent but timid men who will at one*
nay what an awful calamity It Is, and ex
press the deej<c-st sorrow and concern; and \u25a0be
rathT inclined to the belief- that the whole
thing is a failure. It will not be a failure.
It will b*. a Mjccess. and it will be a success
because we shall treat every little check not
as a reason for abandoning the work, but
as a reason for altering and bettering ' our
plans so as to make it impossible that fhat
particular check shall happen again.
CLEAXSIXG OF CUBA*
Whst is being dene in Panama Is but a
earr.pl" cf the things that this country has
done doringr the last few years, of the things
In which your profession has be*n so prominent
a part. Take what wÂ« did In Cuba, where wÂ«
tried the pxserlment which had not i been
tried for 400 years, of cleaning \u25a0 the cities.
One of the most important items of.th* work
done ny our^Goverainent In Cuba -Is the work
of- hygiene, th* wcrk of cleaning * anj dis
infecting the cities so as to - minimize ; the
chance for - yellow fever, co as to â¢do away
with as many aa possible of the conditions that
told for disease. This country has never done
better work, wcrk that reflected more honor
upon Â»be country or for humanity at large,
than the work done in Cuba. - And 'the man'
who -above all others will be, responsible, for
doing that . \u25a0work . *o well v was a \u25a0. member of
your prof*Â«ilon, who when the call to arms
came he himself went as a soldier to the
fieldâ the present Major General- Wood. - Leon

RUSSIA TO SEND HER GREATEST
STATESMAN AS PEACE ENVOY
ST. PETERSBURG,
July 1 3. â '<VT. Mura- i
vicfF has resigned his
as 'chisf. peace
plenipotentiary. It
may be regarded as \u25a0
practically certain that ;
he will be replaced by 'â¢>.
M. de Witte, presi-;
dent of the committee '..
of ministers, who all
along has been con-*';
sidered the Russian
statesman pre - emi-z
nently qualirird to
undertake the difficult
task of negotiating
peace with Japan.
Muravieff Retires
and Be Witte
Will Go.
CHANGE : IN PLANS
Emperor at Last
Heeds Public
Ulamor.
VIE.VV A , July IS.â A mailed report
has been received here from St. Pe
tersburg statin? that 100 kilograms of
dynamite were found in a cellar be
neath the imperial apartments in the
castle of the late Grand Duke .Sergius
at Ilinsky, near Moscow, where the
Czar was expected to take up his resi
dence. Many arrests have been made.
The Csar'a visit has been abandoned.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 13, 2:12 a. m.-^
Though the Emperor on two previous oc
casions has flatly declined to accept M.
d* Witte as a peace plenipotentiary, he
has now indicated his readiness to make
the appointment to nil the vacancy
caused by the resignation of M. Mura
vieff. The commission, however, will not
be actually signed until Foreign Minister
Lamsdorff, who throughout has been M.
de "Witte's warm supporter, has had an
audience with the Emperor. To that ex
tent only the matter may be regarded as
settled, nothing being certain in Russia,
as a prominent diplomat remarked last
night, until the Emperor's signature has
been affixed. â¢
M. de Witte's selection undoubtedly will
be hailed as a practical assurance of
peace. * While it would be a mistake jto
denominate him "as " a "peace at any
price" man, M. de Witte earnestly be
lieves that the struggle should be ended
and should be succeeded by an under-
Etandlng between Russia and Japan
which would secure peace in the Far
East for half a century. Indeed, he is
personally believed to be in favor of a
Russo-Japanese alliance.
The conduct of negotiations by M. de
Witte, it is felt by the peace party here;
would inspire instant confidence in Japan.
The only handicap under which M. de
Witte labors is his lack of familiarity
with the English language, as the only
foreign languages he speaks are German
and French.
M. Muravieff's retirement, ostensibly
owing to reasons of ill health, is in reality
due to the fact that the Emperor be
came convinced that the negotiations
might be Jeopardized if he went to Wash
ington. M. Muravieff himself, upon con
elderation, quite frankly recognized his
lack of diplomatic training and his want
of acquaintance with the questions in
volved, and with equal frankness ex
pressed satisfaction that he had been re
lieved.
Neither the Washington nor the Tokio
Government has yet been officially ad
vised of M. Muravieffs withdrawal, the
Foreign Office probably preferring to an
nounce the name of his successor at the
same time. The change in the chief of
the Philippines does not involve any post
ponement > of the. date of sailing of the
peace mission for Washington.
EDITORS MAY FIGHT A DUEL.
Prince Oulchtomslcy Bitterly Arraigned
by. the Kovoe Vremya.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 12.â The
newspaper criticisms of Muravieff's fit
ness for the post of peace plenipotenti
ary may result in a duel between M.
SkaUlkovsky of the Novoe Vremya and
Prince Oukfatomsky r V editor of the St.
Petersburg Viedomosti. .\u25a0 The former has
not been sparing in his attacks upon
Muravieff. Yesterday Prince Oukhtom
sky took Skaalkovsky* personally , to
task in the Viedomosti, whereupon
Skaalkovsky assailed Prince Oukhtom
eky In a fashion the Prince can hardly
overlook. He says in so many words that
Prince Oukhtomsky.i is \u25a0 a fool, but re
calls Victor Hugo's observation: , .
"While every man has the right to be
a fool, he should not abuse the right."'?
Skaalkovsky proceeds personally : , to
arraign Prince Oukhtomsky for: the al
leged subsidies which he receives from
the Government, saying: . ' : ,
"I am not Prince Oukhtomsky.//No
body grieves for me. I have no sine
cures, subsidies or^ntercsts in railroads
and fantastic - Mongolian gold mines
which compel me, out of gratitude, to
compose servile panegyrics." v.'f

NEW ORLEANS, July U.-A shockinx
story of murder, with robbery as the mo
tive, was brought, to this city to-day by
Captain ,Hans Holm of tha Norwegian
fruit steamer. Bratten, which plies be
tween New Orleans and Honduras ports.
It was separately confirmed -by the of
ficers of. the fruit steamer Roslna. which,
came in later in the evening with addi
tional details. The little island of Utilla.
lying off the'Honduran coast and whose
population is an indiscriminate mixture
of whites, caymanites and carlbs, was tho
scene of the tragedy in which twelvs
lives were sacrificed. The captain ot
the schooner Olympia was about to make
a tsip to Ruatan. TruxlUo and Belize.
She had about 1400 sols and was to buy
cattle at Truxlllo to sell at Belize. She
carried a crew of four and Quit* a num
ber of passengers, making the total list
of people aboard number, thirteen. Among
these were two women and two children.
The vessel left the harbor of Utllla at 11
o'clock Friday night. Juna 30, and after
she had . been under way less than an
hour everybody was aroused by a shot
and rushing on deck found a negro armed
with a rifle shooting down the men one
after another. This negro was Robert
McGlll, and as it afterward developed;
he had , stowed away on board with the
Intention of robbing the captain and then
swimming ashore. After he had killed
all but' one of the men . he ordered the
last survivor to go below' and scuttle the
ship. When the unfortunate reappeared
on deck and. reported, the negro shot
him dead. He then put the two women.
Miss Elsie .Morgan and her sister. Mrs.
Walter Rose, In the dory with . Mrs.
Rose's six weeks' old infant, steering for
the mainland. He changed his mind
about allowing the, women to live, and
killed Mrs. Rose and her Infant. Then
he began shooting at Miss Morgan, who
had leaped overboard, .and wounded her
in the arm. He fired at her Ineffectually,
but his ammunition evidently gave out.
for he promised immunity from harm if
she would, come back to the dory.. She
started back and when within an oar' 3
length he. struck her on the head with
an oar, stunning her. Believing she was
dead/ he rowed away toward the main
land. Miss Morgan, swam back to the'
island, where she was thrown on the
beach by the waves in an exhausted con
dition. She feared that the negro would
follow her, so â¢ she hid in the bushes, and
for two days suffered from the heat and
exposure until . found by a woman from
her neighborhood and rescued from star
vation.. In the meantime the dory had
been washed ashore, and there was great
excitement on the Island, as It was .be
lieved the Olympia had gone down with
all hands. When Miss Morgan told her
story an immediate search was instituted
for McGill and the authorities on the
mainland were .notified. They -.caught
him at Elporvenlr, a little town on the
road to Celbe, and there was a demon
stration, but he was * protected and his
life was saved through the presence on
the coast â¢of President Bonilla, who .was
on an inspection tour.' The Honduran
warship La Tumbla was brought Into ser
vice and the murderer placed aboard and
sent back to the Island. Up to last Sun
day, he was still alive, though it la firmly
believed that he will be/tortured to>
death. . The â¢ laws of Honduras prohibit
the infliction of capital punishment, but
the people will take the case Into their
own hands. , Miss Elsie Morgan.- the only
survivor of .the terrible experience. Visit

NO EXPENSE WILL BE SPARED
IN PROBING COTTON SCANDAL
President Roosevelt's inquiry into the cotton report "leak" in the DepartmentJofrAgri
culture will be sweeping and relentless. The entire secret service, has bee
disposal of, Assistant District Attorney. Beach, who will conduct the investigation. .Repre
sentatives of the cotton' growers intimate that high officials will; be implicated. ' .
President Is Deter
mined to Punish
the Guilty.
Already Preparing to
Prosecute 7 hose
Implicated.
( WASHINGTON/ July 12.â The investi
gation that will be made by .Assistant
District Attorney Morgan H. Beach into
the charges that there has been a leak
age in the matter of preparing the Gov
ernment cotton statistics will be far more
exhaustive than that conducted by secret
service operators at the request of Secre
tary Wilson of the Department of Agri
culture. Acting Attorney General Hoyt
has completed the examination of the
papers transmitted to him by Secretary
Wilson, and believes there should be a
further and detailed legal inquiry. With
that end in view, he has committed the
entire matter to Beach, who intends to
complete his examination before he re
tires from the position of united States
Attorney on August 31. He has taken up
the -subject as prosecuting attorney,
and in ail probability will assist the
Government when the case is brought
into the courts, an outcome of the in
vestigation that is believed by the De
partment of Justice officials to be a cer
tainty.
Expense will not be spared In gather
ing evidence of the methods alleged to
have been employed by Edwin S. Holmes,
the dismissed associate statistician of
the Department of Agriculture, and in
exposing any accomplices be may have
had in his operations. Beach will have
the benefit of the labor of secret service
men who were employed by Secretary
Wilson, and also of the best legal talent
in bis own office.
HUBBARD-WILSOX F*EUD.
A new and interesting phase of the cot
ton leak investigation was developed to
day through the publication of the let
ter of Walter C. Hobart, president of
the New York Cotton Exchange, ad
dressed to President Roosevelt, in which
the writer declared the members of the
exchange had been ""greatly shocked"
fey the recent disclosures of venality in
the Department of Agriculture, and re
quested a full investigation of the meth
ods v.fcSch led to the corruption, with a
view of preventing the possibility of its
recurrence.
The letter is believed here to be the
outcome of recent correspondence be
tween Secretary Wilson and Hubba.-d, in
which the latter called upon the Secre
tary to make him a public apology be
cause he had some years ago called the
Secretary's attention to alleged leaks
and no notice had been given the sug
gestion. The Secretary wrote a tart re*
ply, in which he informed **Ã¼bbard that
he owed no one an apology, in the light
of having done his duty to the best of
his ability, and that when he got any
thing that looked like lacts he promptly
Bent it to the secret service officers to
hunt down. Q
The case to which Hubbard referred
in his recent letter to the Secretary oc
curred in 1900. On December 20 of that
year Hubbard sent to the Secretary pa
pers showing that a ; Mr. Sternberger
wanted to sell information to a New
York cotton brokerage firm, claiming
that he could get it in advance from the
department.
OXLY A!V ATTEMPT TO BI'XKO.
Secretary Wilson immediately turned
the matter over to the secret service offi
cers, but in about a week Chief Wilkie
reported that "it looks like an attempt
of Sternberger to bunko the New York
firm." After allowing two months to
elapse and not hearing further, the Sec
retary, on March 26, 1901, called upon the
secret service for information as to
whether it had made any discoveries.
On the following day Secretary of the
Treasury Gage replied as follows:
The Action of this man who wanted to sell
information was done with the nope of being
*hie to sell information, but as a matter of
(act hie efforts to obtain the advance in
formation failed, as he received no assistance
from the person In Washlnrton upon . whom
he depended for Information.
This report of Gage was transmitted to
Hubbard by Secretary Wilson the next
day and the matter was allowed to drop.
Bet in January, 1902, Hubbard com
plained of having been advised that
Southern glnners were sending to the de
partment returns of their ginning opera
tions bearing the date of December a or
23; "and." said Hubbard, "I am unable
to understand why additional returns
from glnners should be obtained, since
the result is to be published."
It seems, however, that the Department
of Agriculture had not called for any gin
ners' .statistics at that time, but that the
circulars had been issued. from the cen
sus bureau. ...
In the same month, Hubbard wrote the
Department of Agriculture, tasking for
certain information on cotton; but the
Secretary. In the course of a sharp let
ter denying the request, written \u25a0 under
date of January U, 1802, said:
We take the groond here that nothing goes
<mt ur.icsg it toes to the whole people. -WÂ«
have no favorite*. , <
Secretary Wilson to-day permitted "the
examination of the ;' correspondence in
order to show that, as far back as five
years ago, he had taken 'prompt action
to discover any leaks in his office

Doctor Proposes a Plan by

SPEAKS IX PORTLAND
Dr. Stockton of Buffalo in
; Favor of Allowing Only
Physically Fit to Marry
6pÂ«claJ Dispatch to ThÂ« r>mn
PORTLAND, July 12.â Before a large
audience, Dr. Charles J. Stockton, of
Buffalo, N. V., at the First Presbyterian
Church to-night advanced some rather
startling: theories regarding marriage. Dr.
Bioclcton is a leading physician In his
section and one of the- prominent dele
grates to the National Medical Associa
tion now In session here. He advocates a
marriage bureau, where all who wish to
*ed should be compelled to register.
Each applicant should give a complete
ancestral account of himself and from
these applicants the physically fit should
be permitted to marry. The sterilization
of all others would prevent the repro
duction of a feeble race.
The speaker declared the lives of man
kind could be lengthened almost â¢ indefi
nitely by curing decay when It first
makes Its appearance. With proper pre
caution and attention from the medically
\u25a0wise, latter-day folk could attain to the
years of the ancients. With the mar
riage bureau eliminating the Imperfect
specimens of humanity and the child
given a fair start with a sound mind and
a sound body, Methuselahs would, in tTle
course of a few centuries, become as
oommon as 20-year-olds.
No general session was held by the
American Medical Association to-day, but
an Important meeting of the house of
delegates occurred and interesting ses
eions were held by the different sections.
In the house of delegates, thÂ« subject
came up whether a directory of . phy-
Eicians should be provided for, and there
Teas considerable argument as to what
names it should contain. The whole
matter was finally placed In the hands
of the board of trustees with power to
act. Another Important act was the ap
pointment of a nominating: committee to
name officers of the association other
than president, the selection of the lat
ter offlce being the prerogative of tne
general session.
The most interesting of the sectional
meeting's from a layman's viewpoint was
the paper on "Esophagectomy. with re
port of a case with prothetic appliances."
read by Dr. Wallace L. Terry In the
Burgical section.
To illustrate his paper. Dr. Terry pre
sented a patient which he had operated
upon for cancer of the larynx. In cut
ting away the cancerous growth, Dr,
Tern- had made a cavity five Inches up
and "down, by three Inches across, ex
tending back to the vertebrae, and com
pletely severing connection between the
mouth and the stomach. The deficiency
the surgeon had supplied by adjusting a
rubber tube. Through this tube the pa
tient ate and drank In view of the gath
ering of interested surgeons present.

South of Market" Street Musicale Winds Up
in Wild Riot and Arrest oi the Host. ..
The arrival of the phonograph' at the
Lynch residence set the. rest of Tehama
street exeen with envy. When Patrick
Lynch Invited only three of his most in
timate friends to the. opening concert the
Rue de Tehama was made clamorous by
the gnashing of the teeth of the unin
vited.
Miss Blanche Lynch presided at the
execution. After a careful perusal of the
directions ehe turned the crank and the
tin . horn after, a preliminary choke, six
groans and a grunt turned loose in
earnest â¢, â¢ -
Lynch pere and his three cronies, Mike
McGlynn, Dennis Riley and John O'Brien,
listened critically. The thing stopped
with a sudden convulsion.
"For the love of Gawd, fat's the name
of that piece, Blanche?" asked Lynch.
" 'Tis the orechure from 'Willum
Tell,* " replied the daughter. -" .
"Tell with Willum Tell," said { Mr.
Lynch. "Play a bit of a jiÂ« now."
Obediently Blanche Inserted another
record and the phonograph started again.
"Di quella pira," mourned the machine.
"Fat the divil Is that ; ' asked Mr. Mc-
Glynn. "Sure It sounds like a bunch of
Dagoes burled in a trinch."
" 'Tls an alra from 'Throvatore,' "
replied Blanche.
"I thought so," said Mr. McGlynn. "I
know the Eyetallan lingo when I hear
It" \u25a0 .:' â¢ \u25a0 -â¢\u25a0 ' ' \u25a0'
"Glory be, Blanche," said Mr. Lynch.
"Can yez not make that IJlt of a machine
thranslate Itself Into English?" \u25a0Â»\u25a0\u25a0! '.
The phonograph burst Into the
seillaise. "Stop it" ordered Mr. Lynch.
"I bruk *the head of afrog-ater wan
Fourth of July for singing that hr my
ears, and glory be, I'm not going to be
insulted in me own house be me own
darter and me own funny-graph. Play
â¢Klllarney' or the 'Risin of the Moon' or
â¢Kathleen Mavourjieen." "
"None of them records Is here, pa," re
plied Miss Lynch.
"I didn't say nothln' about a record,"
said Mr. Lynch. "Fat we want is a
chune. Glory be, I invite a friend or two
to hear a bit of. music and you fire Dago
and French and the Lord knows fat at
us through a tin horn. Is there a chune
in that machine or Is there not? If there
ain't, we'll go down to Mahoney's and get
Jimmy to give us an aira on the har
money,"
" 'Tis a fine machine, Pat" observed
Mr. O'Brien. "Fat do yet feed it, mac
caronl?"
"Here 's a record that has no name on
It Shall I play it, father?" asked
Blanche.
"Play It and welcome, child If it sings
American. Gawd send us not another
aria." . .
The machine whirled noisily and sud
denly broke Into the ,"Boyne Water."
It got no further than the first few
bars. Lynch reached It first the others
were not far behind. A crowd that had
been listening outside on the street
burst in. Some came through the door,
others came through the windows and
two or three dropped in via a skylight
The phonograph was assailed front flank
and rear. Representatives from different
countries settled a few preliminaries, but,
the main event was the pulverization of
the talking "machine. Patrick Lynch was
pulled* out of the battle and charged
with disturbing the peace. v^Xks*
"I did not disturb the pace, yer Han
ner." he pleaded before Judge Cabaniss."
" Twas the funny-graph." ,
"Well, I'm going to bind you over to
keep the peace for sixty days, any

Lynch, "does that mane I cannot tear

LETTER TO PRESIDENT
Plan Advocated by Which a
Pixed Number of Coolies
Could Enter Every \ Year
PORTLAND, July j 12.â 1n response to
President Roosevelt's Invitation Ito^ the
commercial 'bodies of the Paciflo' Coast to
express | their views -regarding 'the prob
lem of Chinese *or the "restric
tion |of i Immigration > : of : . Chinese to - this
country, President \u25a0 William v D.t ; >Wheel
wright, of, the Portland Chamber of Com
merce, in the. name of:that body,* has for
warded a letter to the President. In part
it.is as follows:; '" V.'; .-c : ,- s ./ :: - ;;: -,"\u25a0.;â¢/\u25a0/\u25a0.= \u25a0
It i B true' that the . citizens of '\u25a0\u25a0 California,
more ' than thirty year* ago, appealed to the
general . Government for protection against aa
apparent danger of \u25a0 unknown . and - therefore
possibly overwhelming proportions, and -. that
primary legislation' to limit Asiatic tmmlgra- .
tion was enacted -in response to that appeal.
In those days , thej,-. Pacltlo Coast was > very
sparsely populated, and .there jwu terror even
in the idea of the " propinquity of \u25a0 a nation f of
four hundred millions- of subjectsâ a myste
rious people, possessed of :' unknown .possibili
ties for cvil â even <to the - fear < that oy f. force
of overwhelming numbers the standards of
Christian and Anglo-Saxon civilization might
be | overthrown. But \u25a0 ' experience .\u25a0 \u25a0 sine* i that
time* has shown that* such fear .was: without
warrant, > that the - Chinese have .- no desire to
attain \u25a0 citizenship, that .they attempt no part
In the administration of affairs, and that they
have no. lnfluence on our institutions. \u25a0' - '
\ Thus It has come |to pass, we | believe, I that
the Pacific. Coast la now no more in favor of
their . exclusion .than ..the - r Middle West,' the
East or the South, and It seems | fitting that
the commercial i bodies of this \u25a0 section ! of ' the
country should cut . themselves on record -to
that effect. By this we do not mean to deny
that opposition still exists on this coast to the
admission of Chinese 'laborers on any terms;
habits of thought and Indulgence < of prejudices
cultivated for more than a quarter of a cen
tury are not to be. eradicated In a day; but
there is now much less opposition , than there
was, and public opinion is .-changing -rapidly,
under the Influence of I new conditions and jof
the stand taken by , your administration, bo
that the time Is ripe for renewed discussion of
the subject.' : -' feS â¢'.' : S ~ \u25a0-..- '\u25a0'\u25a0â¢:\u25a0\u25a0 . .\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0' i ! *
While the country appreciates the effort* that
the Government ' has I recently. \u25a0 made ito . Insure
better treatment of the few Chinese that come
here, we are convinced that ! these efforts will
not touch the root of the difficulty,- and that
the ' negotiation of a new 'treaty - and the I en
actment of new laws by Congress are neces
sary to the maintenance of the principles :of
humanity on which this " Government . Is found
ed, and to the establishment of harmonious re
lations between the United â¢ States and - China.
It is not only necessary that all : immigrants
who come here should | be humanely and fairly
treated, and that all who have a right under
existing treaties to admission- shall , bo ' admit
ted without \u25a0 subjection to harsh, and humil
iating treatment; ' and* that registration . pa
pers Issued In accordance with ; treaty stip
ulations In ; China : and â¢ vised ,by American
Consuls shall .be accepted I aa . final, . but | we
believe it to be" Imperative that privileges
similar to . thosÂ« enjoyed *by * the - subjects of
other nations - shall -be : extended, under suit
able restrictions, to â¢ the Chinese. . ..-.\u25a0-
The fear that they will exercise a demoraliz
ing . Influence on our. civilization has passed
away; their usefulness as patient and intelli
gent laborers, who give a full equivalent for
the wages risked, and practically all of whom
return sooner .or later ,to their , own land,
has been demonstrated. iThey are needed,
especially In the undeveloped portions jof the
country, to <3& tho work ; that remains 'â¢ un
done because â¢' :thfet* lls an Insufficient - supply
â¢of. laborers;to do -It. ,and, they arÂ« wanted
as household servants because the sons and
daughters of American laborers aspire to
higher ' positions ' and are not content -to per
form menial service. . ;r;: : :',, ; .-â¢ â¢ \u0084^j
.The objections to their t admission .for these
purposes* come mainly we believe, - from those
laborers who think the standard of wages and
the position of the wage-earner -will both.be
lowered by their 'competition, - but 'we ! submit
that the average - condition . of .. the laborer In
this country has constantly. Improved and still
continues to improve. In spite of an enor
mous Immigration of working :. people > from
nearly every country of : Europe, and that there
Is no ' objection to the . admission to Paciflo
Coast ports of a moderate number of .Chinese
tha* does not He with equal force ' against
the entry into New ' York. Boston and Phil
adelphia of Italians.] , Poles, Slavs, '- Russians
and . the inhabitants of Southeastern * Europe.
Now . that the treaty has expired and the
negotiations for a new. modus vlvendl have
failed and the Chinese are therefore threaten
ing hostile action.' it is easy to see that .not
on 1-'1 -' the Oriental trade will not continue to
grow, but that there is danger of Ua com
plete*- cessation."-'*-*- 1 - 1 '
Moved Iby all . these considerations -w* re
spectfully urge upon you. Mr. President, the
taking r of -~ steps ; toward negotiating, a new
treaty with China, that shall provide for the
removal of the exacting conditions that now
attach to the entrance - Into j this country of
their merchants,' students, and .professional
men ' for the absolute freedom of all ..Chines*
residents? of" this country to visit; their own
land and : return : here. â¢ and for the 'f admission

NOVEL PROTEST IS
3IADE BY CITIZEN
Berkeley Man Demands That
Marshal Shall Protect
Fountain.
' BERKELEY, July 12. â Inveighing
bitterly against what he styled the
"extraordinary conduct" of Chief Dep
uty Marshal Levi Moran In refusing to
protect the beautiful public fountain in
the plaxa from those who make it a
place for washing. John E. Boyd, a
well-known citiien. to-day consulted
â¢with the Town Attorney in an endeavor
to ascertain If the Police Department
cannot be compelled to protect tht
property of the town from those who
have no conception of the proper uses
to which such property should be put.
The drinking- fountain was the gift
of Mrs. Hearst to Berkeley several
years ago. Mr. Boyd has always taken
a peculiar interest in it, having but
recently secured the co-operation of the
Town Trustees in repainting and gen
erally beautifying it. Boyd was hor
rified and disgusted to observe this
morning a Greek peanut peddler step
to the fountain and wash his grimy
hands in the basin in which the drink
ing cup Is kept.
Boyd protested and was told to "mind
his own business." Straight to the
Marshal's office went the indignant
citizen, there meeting Chief Deputy
Moran, In charge during Marshal Voll
mer 1 * absence from the city. To his
surprise he was informed by the police
official that the fountain deserved no
protection, was used "only by HÂ«ly
Jumpers and Salvation Army people,"
vras Intended for bathing purposes
originally, and that Boyd's interference
was unwarranted.
Believing that the Police Department
or its head could be forced to protect
public property from those who would
soil it and make It worthless Mr. Boyd
announced that he would at once con
sult the legal authorities and if neces
sary take steps in court to compel ac
tion by Chief Deputy Moran -for tlm
preservation of the public fountain's
cleanliness.
3IAKES A STUDY OF
INDIAN LANGUAGE
Professor Devotes Bulletin to
Description of Hupa Tribe's
Peculiar Dialect.
BERKELEY, Julr 12- â Professor
Pliny 1L Goddard ofÂ«foe anthropological
department of the University of Cali
fornia has Just issued a bulletin, sup
plementing two written by him, three
years ago, dealing with his work" in
collecting information about the lan
guage and folk lore of the Hupa tribe
of Indians.
This tribe, of the Athapascan stock,
on s.the. the Trinity River, in Humboldt
County, is rapidly becoming extinct and
now numbers only about. 400 souls.
Professor Goddard â¢ took with him a
Rousselot machine, by means of which
phonographic records were procured to
the number of 4000. The machine also
registers ' the length of consonant and
vowel sounds and in other ways pre
serves a record of the peculiar, speech
of the Indians.
Professor Goddard secured many of
the legends of the tribe and much folk
lore which . otherwise would have per
ished without being recorded. His lat
est bulletin deals principally with the
grammatical characteristics of the lan
guage.

Gossip was. arrested Sunday night at
Thirteenth and Franklin streets, where
he had fallen from a street car in an ap
parently condition. He was
in such a serious condition that he could
not appear in the Police Court for trial.
Dr. .Williams was '\u25a0 called to examine the
man. who. it was suspected, was suf
fering from a~ fracture of the skull. But
the physician. | after examinination, de
clared this injury did not exist.
Observation led to the suspicion that
Gossip was the victim of a powerful drug.
His brain seemed to be benumbed. There
was no response to efforts to arouse him
from a stupor that was, ,it appeared,
siowly sapping his vitality.; Gossip was
unable to give ari account of himself,
and up to a late hour this afternoon
seemed to be sinking. Tonight the pa
tient, rallied with the possibility of re
covery. \u25a0;'-*

Officials of San Qnentin
Discover a/ Bold Plot to
Smuggle Drugs to Prison
THREE ARRESTS . MADE
San Franciscans Implicated
in Scheme and a Further
Inquiry Is to Be Made
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. July 12.â Three men are
in the county jail to-night charged , with
smuggling at San Quiniin. To-day Dis
trict Attorney Bbjwi swore to a complaint
charging Frederick Coulter and Antonio
Mello with taking morphine into the
prison. Warden Tompkins ' swore to a.
complaint charging Philip Rojas with
carrying a letter out of the prison with
out his consent. -" For some time Warden
Tompkins had been under the impres
sion that f narcotic- drugs were coming
into the prison through the cpnvict steve
dore - gang and the deck hands of the
freight steamship Caroline, plying be
tween the prison and San Francisco. On
Monday' his suspicions were verified and
the arrests followed.
I According to information in possession
of the warden.- Convict Charles* Coulter,
a waiter ,in - the convict j dining room,
wrote two letters at different times to his
brother, Frederick Coulter, of 4248 Te
hama* street, San Francisco, signing
them:"C." Convict Norton, who works
in the stevedore gang, gave the letters to
Convict Sailor May to give to Rojas to
mall in San Francisco. Shipping Clerk
James Gorman detected May with - the
letters, read and copied them, and,- re
sealing them, gave them back. Rojas
received the letters and they reached
their destination. "~
One letter requested Frederick . Coulter
to get a package at the postofflce ad
dressed to "Charles Roy." purchase other
articles and deliver them at 65 Jackson
street for Antonio Mello, a deck hand on
the Caroline.
On Monday, as the Caroline was being
discharged. Shipping Clerk Gorman
watched Sailor May closely and saw him
place a , package behind a water barrel.
Then Norton picked it up and, when
searched; it was found secreted in his
shirt. The package contained morphine
worth fully six dollars. When questioned.
Convict Counter denied any knowledge of
the letters or morphine, while Convict
Norton denied handling the letters. Both
have been placed in the incorrigible cells.
Convict May acknowledges handling the
letters and the drug.
Shipping Clerk Gorman went to see
Frederick Coulter yesterday. Coulter
mistook Gorman for the deckhand and
after a few sympathetic words from Gor
man, Coulter handed him a package of
morphine; for his brother Charlie; When
accused of handling the package of morf
phlne, and receiving a canary bird and
shoes 'for his services, Antonio Mello de
nied handling it k but' said 'he received the
bird."'- "'â¢\u25a0 - â¢". ..: "â¢ .;: ;-':- ;
Charles Coulter is serving a three years'
sentence from San Francisco for burg
lary. Both brothers and Norton are dope
fiends. Rojas. when seen to-night, said
that he was innocent and that he had
not carried any letters from convicts.
Sheriff Taylor brought Mello here yes
terday and Rojas and Coulter . here to r
day. \u25a0Â» Sheriff Taylor has gone to San
Francisco this evening , to make further
investigation. The penalty for smuggling
is one to five years in the State Prison.
Ed Ryan, serving a five-year term
from San Luis Obispo, who is employed
as a cook at the residence of . Super
intendent Rlordan, was detected smug
gling opium to-day. The opium w^sr
found in the soles of his shoes.

ASKS HOW OFTEN HE
MAY SEE HIS CHILD
Tnixtim Beale '.-.Appeals' to
Coil rt for Interpretation
of Divorce Agreement.;
AUGUSTA. Me.. July Itâ A hearing
was held to-day before Judge White
house in the Supreme Judicial Court to
determine definitely how often Trux
turi Beale may be permitted to see hla
child. Walker Blame Beale. in accord
ance with the spirit of a divorce
granted Mrs. Beale eight years ago.
Beale was formerly ; United States
Minister to Persia and Mrs. Beale was
Harriet Blame. youngest child of James
G- Blame. -
Both Mr. and Mrs. Beale were present
at the hearing; which lasted for several
hours in chambers. The Judge took
the case under advisement and will
give his decision later. There appears
to be a mutual wish between Mr. and
Mrs. .Beale that the " boy. who is nine
years ' old. should be reared properly
and both showed by their attitude that
they dearly loved the child. Beale "re
cently purchased a summer home on
the 'cast shore of "Coboze- Center Laka
and. young Walker has spent some time"
there this season. He has always lav
ished* princely gifts on his son and it
is understood that last winter he gave
the boy a $300,000 home in Washington.
Last week he presented him with a
gasoline "launch and some handsome
horses.- > \u25a0

up a peg. With the Infield playing in to
choke off a run at the plate. Spencer
threw his bat at a ball and a Trias
leaguer dropped just over the -Infield, and
two runs came home.

SCROFULA
FROM PARENT TO CHILD
The laws of heredity are " invariable
find the diseased blood of parents is
handed down to children in the form of
Scrofula. Being thus deeply rooted
nothing can reach the disease but a con-
Rtitntional remedy. The very foundation
of the blood is diseased, and until it is
purified and made strong, those who are
born with a scrofulous tendency cannot
have the blessing of robust health.!
Cleveland, 0., 122 Brownell St. '
I inherited Scrofula from my ancestry,
and thl* means, of course, weak, impure
-lood and a run-down, debilitated con-
dition of the system. Treatment of phy-
sicians did not do me anything like the
pood S. S. S. did last winter when I took
it. It promotes appetite and digestion,
gives strength and energy, builds up
the R-eneral health in every way, and in
addition to being an excellent blood pu-
rifier it adds to its success as* remedy
for Scrofula. It did more for me than
anything I have used, and with pleas-
ure I recommend it. B.S. 8. completely
cured me of this bliffhtimr disease^/
MBS. LOUISE COHEN,
'S. S. S., the king of blood purifiers, is
the medicine' tliat is required,' because it
changes the quality of the 'blood by
cleansing it of all poisons and impurities,
building it* up and strengthening the ; en-
tire system. When S. S. S. has restored
the blood to a healthy : condition Cand
out the scrofulous deposits,* # there,
is a sure return to health.'. No remedy,
has ever been found to equal this great
vegetable preparation for thVcurelof all
diseases arising

The Angels came back at the Cum
muters yesterday, Just like the latter
bunch passed it to the southern stars on
Tuesday. Oakland, had the game In till
the seventh. But the grandest display of
the day came to pass In about five min
utes and a bunch of three runs and four
hits tolled the death knell of Oakland for
the day.
The game waa characterized by the ap
pearance as an umpire of ancient Cal
Me Vey, the man who used to be a star
with the Cincinnati Red Sox back in '66.
Cal was pretty slow In calling 'em and
very undecided in his attitude. . He was
none too fast in getting around and in
specting the plays at the bases, but for
tunately had no close ones to decide.:
Charlie Baum had a bit of luck with
him again and with perfect support he
got away with the honors nicely. In just
one Inning the Commuters landed hard on
him and then the rally stopped before
much damage had been done. A one
hand catch by Ross saved a couple of
runs and took some of the fight out ot
the Commuters.
Francks began the rally in the fourth
with a long two-cushloner against the
center field fence. Bernard was slumber
ing and started for the ball too late.
Kelly swung on a fast one and it started
out to left like a triple. But Ross hook
ed It with one mitt on the dead run.
Dunleavy had his eye and walloped past
the flagpole for three stations, giving the
Commuters the only one they could nego
tiate.
The Angels could not make good till the
seventh, when Dillon and Brashear found
the leather for singles, Dillon going to
third on Brash's . clout. . Ross tore one
through to , right and Dillon came In.
Spies laid down a bunt and everybody
started to run. Ross saw 1 that Ham
Iberg was asleep and he scooted all the
way from second, rlt was a pretty play
and received the approval of \u25a0 the fans.
The score: , , \u25a0;

PHILANTHROPIC COLONIZATION.
H RIDER HAGGARD, the popular writer of romantic fiction,
has recently presented to the British Parliament his report
â¢upon the work intrusted to him by the Colonial Office. That
duty was to study the Salvation Army colonies in the United States
and at Hadleigh, England. The information was wanted to aid in
| the planning of a scheme of national land settlementâ the. projected
| .transfer of urban populations of the United Kingdom to. the differ
ent parts of the British Empire. The report has enough of en
couragement to philanthropic workers to make the romance of real
ity more attractive than fiction. Some day Mr. Haggard may write
of. marvels done in colonization a true story which will be of more
thrilling interest to the public than any of the tales of imagination
with which he has delighted readers.
Among the things Haggard has to say to Parliament are items
that come close home to us. Only 150 miles from San , Francisco Js
" located what he believes to be the best example of philanthropic
â¢ colonization in the world. It is Fort Romie, in the Coast Range,
: near Soledad. The enterprise was undertaken by the Salvation
Army in conjunction with a committee of the San Francisco Cham
ber of Commerce. The election of this as a chief instance for the
study by the empire which is the pre-eminently successful colonizer
of all the xvorld should be regarded as a red letter achievement for
the Salvation Army, for our State and for our city. There is ro
mance in the story of Fort Romie as Haggard tells it,, in that it
embodies a record of a victory over disheartening difficulties. There
was enough of temporary loss, failure, discouragement in the first
essays to have caused hearts less stanch than those of the army
to abandon the whole enterprise as a bad business and a futile
dream. The colonizers, working not for the love of money, but with
the motive of kindness for humanity, pocketed the loss, bravely
learned the lessons of defeat, persisted, and triumphed. For .those
who have not time to read the full report it is sufficient to have
this summing up: "It comes to this, therefore, that it would-be
difficult to find a better instance of the advantage of skillfully man
aged land settlement for the benefit of persons without capital than
; that which is offered by Fort Romie, California. Indeed, I doubt if
such another exists."
Haggard says the financial success of the scheme : would be
l much plainer than appears on the surface if the army had not been
so kind. He thinks the colonists should be made to pay more for
the advantages they have received. In figuring the financial profits,'
what the colonists have accumulated must be considered as well as
the accounts of the army. In the general study of this philan
thropic colonization work a notable item is that men without any
? capital, just with their natural endowments of industry, muscle and
intelligence, have proved more successful colonists than the average
of those who had money to invest. That is one of .the most encour
aging truths extracted by the inquiry, for the beauty of the scheme
is that it opens the possibility of prosperity and home possessing to
I those who deserve but cannot gain them in the crowded cities.
SAN JOAQUIN DRY WINES.
A STUDY of the manufacture of dry wines in hot countries
made by Frederick T. Bioletti for the University of California
College of Agriculture, with the assistance of the California
grape growers, gives very encouraging results for the San Joaquin
Valley. The wine makers have been turning the grape product into
sweet wines to the neglect of dry i wines under the belief that the
climate was too hot in the fall months for their proper production.
It is desirable to make some dry wines because many of- the varie
ties grown in the valley are better adapted to dry wines than to
sweet, and in the crisis of a heavy production of sweet wines ability
to manufacture part of the crop into dry wines would be of great
advantage to the whole market.
The report is the outcome of a visit to the vine-growing re
gions of Europe and Algeria. The finest dry wines of the world
have been produced in regious that are relatively cooL In these
cool regions the vine does not attain full development and the crop
is lighter. It has been ascertained that the superiority of this wine
is not due so much to the quality of the grapes as to the process of
manufacture. This process is successful because the fall months
are cool. The same methods attempted in a hot climate fail to pro
duce a sound dry wine. Experience of this failure discouraged Cali
fornia manufacturers. It is now known that the 'fine quality and
keeping properties . can be put into the product by using methods
specially adapted to hot climates. * The chief feature of this hot
climate manufacture is the control of fermentation. The discussion
of the various lines on which this problem has been experimented
with is the subject of the body of the bulletin.
It is admitted that if this industry is to pay. here the quality
of wine must be higher than_in the past, and the results must be
more under the manufacturers' control. These investigations by Bio
letti, which have been aided by members of the California Viticultural
Club, and perfected by foreign travel, have led him to an assured
belief that there is no region in the world "where the wine-maker
can be so sure of making every year a good, sound, dry "wine of
uniform quality as in the great central plain of California." So su
perior is the quality of the grapes grown around Fresno that cxV
periments show twentyjtons of grapes will, without the expense; of
concentration such as is used in France, give 3200 gallons of wine
equalin quality to 2400 gallons made from the same quantity of.
French grapes. " ; \u25a0"
THE NEED OF PEACE.
THE recent speech of General Lord. Roberts in Parliament I could
be used in another. Hague conference as a plea for universal
peace. Russia is an example of the' small reliance that can be
placed in a European army. Yet all Europe is an- armed camp, and
the greed for land and glory, that seems to go with those large far
maments, may at any time cause an outbreak of war,' the' conse
quences of which cannot be foreseen.
England has an enormous territory to defend, simply because
the magnitude of the empire tempts the cupidity of rivals. The milir
tary situation of the world should admonish the United States Sen
ate to abate its opposition to the President's arbitration policy."
When a nation strong as this is deliberately adopts as its policy the
ieducing of the causes of war, by taking over to arbitration any con
siderable, number of the issues heretofore regarded as capable of son
lution only by the sword, a great step has been; taken to make, peace
the permanent policy of the world. It is.an:example sure tobelfol-^
lowed by others. It means the promotion of international "justice
and fair dealing, and the security of the weak in all of their just
rights. The programme of friendship between the United States
and Great Britain and, the. obvious policy of Japan tb; secure a long
term of peace for the restoration of her strength and the develop
ment of her. people are factors in a peace programme that cannot
be overlooked.
It seems to be conceded that as far as Europe is concerned the
militant Kaiser is an obstacle in the way of^universal amity; Alf he
would abate his war preaching the \would improve. His
grandfather made war, but -regretfully. When it was
that his adventure against France could not be \u25a0postponed, the;* old
King ,wept and . cried out; "It is a sorrow that I must have war in
my old age." The ? grandson is not yet tempered; by time, arid iis a
fit subject for missionary effort by the Universal : Peace"; Society.
Racial and national prejudices are played upon by :\u25a0\u25a0 ambitious
rulers, when the people, left to their own -devices^ would /have; iio
issues that arbitration could not settle. It* is r alm6st the single
merit of the Socialists that they are the advocates of fpeace. If they
would omit the rest of ; their^ programme and put .their power int J
this alone they might greatly ; influence \u25a0 the decision of the -'world
that war, being-, inherently" bad, is to be .avoided. <(\u25a0'[

THE. EDITOR AND THE -POET.
THE Managing- Editor had summon
ed the Poet to his , presence: for! a
brief heart to heart talk with him:
"Sayl'V.he said as: soon as the Poet
appeared, "what sort . of . a'< Illy Â£ of . the
field do i you \ think ; you.ar e, r that toils
not neither does it spin; yet Solomon in
all his glory never wore such a neck
tie and hair as you do?" - \u25a0Vl/J
: The Poet moved his feet uneasily,
tossed back his ravins' locks, and be
gun his defense: . - r .
â¢ "The weathâ "cÂ«f/ :
i But the Managing Editor did not wait
for him to continue. .. .
' "Don't \u25a0I * pay you and your Muse a
regular salary," he said, 'to give our
readersthe benefit" of 'little chirps, of
cheer and symphonies of praise?";
"But the weathâ "
"And you have neither chirped nor
symphed once for almost a week! How
long do you think I am going to stand
this sort of thing? : How; long, do you
think it will be before I will gag your
Muse and kick Pegasus out \u25a0 of the
stable?"
There were tears In; the" Poet's. nut
brown eyea.'jbut: he manfully> winked
them back before he made his defense.
"The weather, you know," he urged,
"has waxed exceeding hot, and 1-^-1 dis
like to say it, but it has sort of found
ered - the: Muse and given: Pegasus the
heaves. It is so difficultâ so surpassing
d iffl-.iult, I may sayâ to turn outlthor
oughly satisfactory chirps from a par
boiled brain. Someway,' though. you'do
your best, the weather gets into every
thing ' you write, and . , melts .?.- It >. and
musses it up. For ; example,: the i city
editor wished me to write a little com
plimentary paean to run in connection
with the report of the Sonne-Strucke
wedding. I did my best, but .this: Is
what resulted:

But- they were fried. .
"The weather would obtrude itself,
and I couldn't, help' it, but', it, never
would havedone to have turned in that
sort of thing, so I turned in nothing.
Then I tried to\. write a i little ! lyric to
love. '.'Here Is the result:
"To lovel str.'kefmy- tuneful lyre.

Yes, fire's the ;word. '>.Â»;;

enough. Then 1 was requested to write
a brief obituary verse to soothe the be

After Quarrel With Woman
With Whom He Had Lived
the Well-Known Clubman
and Banker Takes Poison
FOUND UNCONSCIOUS
AT HOTEL HIGGINS
Hospital Surgeons Hold Out
Little Hope to Frantic
Mother, Who Prays Heaven
to Save Son From Death
A pitiful scene was enacted in thÂ»
Emergency Hospital Â»last night when
the aged mother of Beverly Letcher, a
well-known clubman and chief loan
clerk of the San Francisco Savings
Bank, with a tearful face raised heav
enward Implored the Creator to save
her son from death. Letcher was dis
covered unconscious in a room in the
Higgins Hotel, on * OFarrell street.
6hortly after 7 o'clock last evening. He
was apparently suffering from opium
poisoning, and, it being realized that
Immediate medical assistance was
necessary, the young man was hurried
to the hospital. There Dr. O. S. Ku
cich worked over the patient for sev
eral hours without satisfactory re-
Eults, and at midnight it was not ex
pected that Letcher \u25a0 would recover
consciousness.
It is believed that Letcher took poi
son with, suicidal Intent after a quarrel
with Marion Pennlngton, who con
ducts a rooming-house at 311 Grant
avenue, andNvith whom he had been
living. Shortly after Letcher was
taken to the hospital the Pennington
woman called there and represented
herself as his sister. Her identity,
however, soon became known, and she
\u25a0was finally turned over to Detectives
Wren and Reynolds, to whom she re
lated the story of her relations with
Letcher.
According to her statement she had
been with Letcher for three years.
Three days ago they quarreled and she
informed her lover that she was tired
of him anJ proposed to leave him.
Letcher implored her not to leave him
and she agreed to meet him at lun
cheon on Tuesday. During the meal
the Pennington woman told Letcher
that she did not want to see him
again, to which declaration he replied.
"If you Â«So not return to me I will be
dead to-morrow night."
Apparently Letcher tried hard to
keep his word. Tuesday, shortly be
fore midnight, he engaged a room at
the Higgins House and that was the
last seen of him until last evening. A
few minutes after 7 o'clock -Manager
Huey of the hotel, suspecting that
something was wrong, forced the door
of Leteher's room and found the lodger
unconscious. T>r. W. .J, Henesey._ ( was
summoned and he pronounced the" case
one of opium poisoning and advised the
landlord to send the patient te the hos
pital.
When it was determined later in the
evening that Letcher's chances of re
covery were very small his brother and
his aged mother, who live In San Ra
fael, were summoned to his bedsl<?3.
The grief-stricken mother, bowed by
her infirmities, made a most pathetic
picture as she kneeled by the side of
her son and begged plteously for* his
life, while the dying- man's mistress
stood at a respectful distance with her
face turned from the weeping parent.
During the evening a number : of
Letcher's club friends called at the
hospital and expressed great surprise
at the rash act he had committed. The
mother and brother of the dying man
remained in the hospital during the
night
Letcher is 42 years of age. His wife
died several years ago, leaving a young 1
eon, who is now in Honolulu. He is a.
director of the North Shore Road and
the Mill Valley and Mt. Tamalpais Rail
way, in both of which he is a stock
liolder. It Is said that Letcher had
been drinking heavily for some time.
CRUSHED UNDER

1 FRESNO, July 12.â About 10 o'clock to
night a Southern Pacific switch engine
\u25a0with several freight cars attached, ran
over Willard Zibbell, a prominent race
horse driver of the State, and B. S. Mc-
Mahah of the publication Breeder and

CLOSE ENGAGEMENT AT THE
CALIFORNIA SUNDAY NIGHT.
CLOSE SEASON
SUNDAY NIGHT
Florence Roberts has decided to give
one special farewell perf romance' of
"Tess of the D'Urbervilles" at the Cali
fornia Theater on Sunday night. Satur
day night was to have been her- original
closing night but owing to her sudden
Illness last Sunday,. causing the dismi3sal
of a large audience. Miss Roberts felt
that she owed an extra performance to
the regular Sunday night patrons. of .the
California and consequently she promptly,
made arrangements to extend her ren
gagement accordingly.
. Miss Roberts has accomplished this sea
son more than any other - actress has
ever dared to attempt. She has. played
forty-eight consecutive weeks without a
rest of any eort, including matinees
twice a week* and sometimes three times.
When It Is. taken into consideration that
when this remarkable actress Is not en
during the fatigue of travel, she is: re
hearsing-every day from 10 o'clock in the
morning until 4 in the afternoon. In addi
tion to appearlngjftm 'the stage every
night from 8 to \u25a0 o'clock, some Idea
can be obtained of the strain that forty -
weeks of continuous playing means
to her. \u25a0?-. \u25a0 : . .-. ' ' - \u25a0â¢ '--<:
On top of all this Miss Roberts is per
sonally attending to all of the details of
her testimonial: benefit to Hobart Bos
worth, which takes place at the Califor
nia on Friday afternoon.

OMEGA SHIPS
A HEAVY SEA
Ware Washes Steersman
From Wheel and Fills Cab
in Knee-Deep With Water
LEAPS TO HIS DEATH
UnknoTni Young Man Jumps
Into Bay From Upper Deck
of Ferry - Boat Oakland
OaÂ« wav#> to thÂ» wrong place nearly
settled the career of the schooner Ome
r*,. which arrived here yesterday from
Coos Bay Trtth a cargo oÂ£ lumber. 'The
\u25a0ea ran hleh at many time" during 1 the
wlnfi3aminer"B run down the coast, and
btcger wave* than the one that caused
the trouble slid harmlessly beneath the
stout bull. On July 10, when the schooner
was fifteen miles southwest of Point
Arena, there came roaring: from the
northwest a heavy rala. As the schooner
was southbound, the storm was more
help than hindrance, as long as the big
seas were satisfied to stay In the ocean.
One of them got suddenly frisky, how
ever, and at 8 o'clock p. m_ leaped over
the rail on the starboard Quarter and
dropped with all Its great weight on the
Omega's deck.
Hans L-axsen, who was at the wheel,
glanced over his .shoulder just In time to
see the wall of water rushing toward
film. Like a good sailorman, be took a
good grip on the spokes and prepared
to stay at his post. But his grip was not
strong enough, and In less time than it
takes to tell of it Hans was sprawling
along the deck, bruised, winded and half
drowned.
After sweeping Larsen into the scup
pers, the wave went on a tour of inves
tigation. It visited the galley and dis
arranged the cook's arrangement for
the next day's breakfast. It added cold
and wet to the discomfort of the fore
castle, but it was in the cabin that the
vagrant sea had the best time.
Captain Nyman was just putting on
his slippers when the water came tum
bling down the companionway. In a mo
ment the comfortable cabin was knee
deep in water. Leaving the unbidden vis
itor to do its worst. Captain Nyman
rushed on deck to find the Omega sail
ing and steering herself. He grabbed
the wheel and yelled for the watch. It
was all over in a. few minutes. The sea
ran out through the scuppers. A dry
man was ordered to the wheel. Larsen
was sent below to recuperate and Cap
tain Nyman went below and spent the
rest of the evening grappiing in his
cabin for clothes, papers, books and other
movables that had tumbled Into the
flood. It took some time to clear the
cabin of water, and tae place was still
damp yesterday when the schooner came
into port.
The Omega was sixty hours coming
from Coos Bay. and she brought 700.000
feet of lumber.
Unknown Drowns Himself.
An unknown young man Jumped into the
bay at 12:35 a. m. yesterday from the upper
deck of the fÂ«jrry-boat Oakland and was
drowned. A boat was lowered, but no trace
of the suicide's body could be round. M.
Cerf, who has an office at 434 Crossley build
ing, and T. 11. Ford of 320 California street
witnessed the iz.ts.l leap. The young man was
sitting near them in the upper deck cabin.
When the boat reached the vicinity of Goat
Island he suddenly got up and walked to the
door. "Good-by." he shouted and running to
the rail jumped overboard. He left on the
seat an overcoat In which was found a email
card case. The card case contained a. nickel,
two pennies, tobacco and cigarette papers. The
name "B. B. Brown" was written in pencil on
a card In the case. The suicide Is described
as being between 19 and 20 years old, dark
complexloned and clean shaved. The over
coat, a cheap, striped affair. Is In the hands
of the police at the Harbor Station.
A Busy Barkentlne.
The tour-masted b&rkentlne Georglna, which
arrived July 6 from Honolulu and docked yes
terday at Howard street wharf No. 2, is one
of the busiest sailing vessels owned at this
port. Since 1901, when she was launched at
Fair-haven, she has been in constant commis
sion, sailing off shore most of the time. This
is only the third time she has visited her
home port and she will not be here very long.
She goes from here to Portland, where she
will load lumber for San Pedro. Although
four years old. the GÂ«orglna has been so well
eared for that she still looks a new vessel.

The Stato Mining Bureau has been

As \an evidence of ' the wholesome j fear
of r prosecution /which -has \u0084 tilled '.the

Aubury -of : a. number who have
already- thought it | wise . to . begin to. fold

satisfied : that -it will j not |be j long ; before

California "'..mines. ''-.'- ,
V Copies ; : of the : Aubury bill have been"

Works Board Claims Team
ing: Specifications Were
i^eparedin Defective Way
Health Officer Ragaa yesterday sent the
f ollowing \ letter \u25a0to the , Board of t Works
and the , Supervisors',. Street Committee,
calling ; attention to - the danger of infec
tion from the accumulation of dirt in the
streets resulting from ,-' the : cessation of
cleaning operations because of a clash be
tween;, the Supervisors " and ; the ' Works
Board over" the award of - contract to A.
B. Clute to haul away; the sweepings:
"F. A:?Maestretti. ; President Board ;of
Public Works:
"In s view 'of ; the . accumulation of dirt
upon our streets at the present time, and
in view of the prevailing high winds, the
Department : of J Health wishes to guard
against Infection by -dust. The rapid
changes- In the" temperature within" the
past week have developed a crop of acute
catarrhal troubles of the nose and throat.
These â¢. discharges, -In many ? cases, reach
the i street , dust and < become a , source ; of
Infection. Our medical specialists on dis
eases of the nose and : throat are report-
Ing many- more cases of infection of the
glands of the neck, by reason of the:ln
vasion of the nose 1 and throat -by the
germs of communicable diseases. In view
of the fact that the public health Is thus
endangered we hope that a speedy and
amicable settlement of the difference
now existing between your department
and the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors; over the street sweeping con
tract will be adjusted."
The Supervisors' : Street Committed waÂ»
to have held a conference with the Board
of Works: relative to the blocking of
street cleaning operations said: to be due
to the inabllity.of A. B. Clute. who waa
awarded the teaming contract by thÂ©
Board of Supervisors, to carry out - his
contract properly. At Clute's request the
conference was postponed until this after
noon at 1:30 o'clock.'
\u25a0'\u25a0 Clute has agreed to furnish extra teams
at no expense to the city to haul away
the accumulated" dirt. Yesterday the
Board of Works reluctantly allowed the
street sweeping gang to work in some of
the districts. At 5 o'clock many Blocks
were littered with refuse and unless Clute
acts promptly the men will be laid off
temporarily. ... --, " *i. \u2666 \u2666*Â«
The Works Board now claims that tne
specifications in the call by the Board
of Supervisors for the proposals for team
ing were defective, inasmuch as they did
' not specify the capacity of the wagons
or that they would be ! used In street
sweeping/operations. The specifications
simply read "team and \u25a0 wagon, and the
board takes the ground that Clute can
not be compelled to 4 enlarge his wagons
to the size of the old wagons + even
though he has, voluntarily agreed to do
so, and that he cannot be held respon
sible on account of the specifications hav
ing been faultily drawn. <
Supervisor Braunhart acknowledged yes
terday that the specifications were hastily
drawn, but refers . to -Clute's willingness
to make the, necessary; changes. _
'Again 1 Clute *was permitted ?b y * h8 ' Â° v !
p'ervSoii I to deposit a"certifled checkfof
only UOO.U although Madigan &^ Tuttle
submitted-a check- for $2000 on the as
sumption that' the contract would amount
to $20,000. ; I Clute has furnished a bond^of
$7500 and this, is regarded as insufficient
by the Board of Works.

FAMOUS JEWISH
RABBI ARRIVES
Dr. Emil G. Hirscli of Chi
cago Comes to Sari Francis
co on a Lecturing Tour
KNOWN. AS A EEFOEMER
One of First to Advocate
Holding Services in the
Synagogues on Sundays
Dr. Emil G. Hlrsch of Chicago, who is
among the foremost Jewish rabbis of
this country, arrived here yesterday and
is \u25a0 registered at the St. Francis HoteL
He came â¢ from Portland, where he lec
tured at the Lewis and Clark Exposition,
and will * address the congregation o*
Temple Kmanu-EI on Saturday morning.
Dr. Hlrsch is rabbi of the Sinai congre
gation of Chicago, where his attitude in
matters of reform in the Jewish faith
has made him a prominent figure . for
over a quarter of a century. He was ona
of the first to advocate holding services
in the Jewish synagogue on Sunday in
stead of Saturday, claiming that inas
much as " Sunday Is . the ' civic day of
rest, the better were the advantages on
that day for preaching thÂ© religion of his
followers.
"In the Sunday movement," said Dr.
Hlrsch yesterday, "I was strongly op
posed by many rabbis throughout this
country, and these rabbis and their con
gregations still oppose the idea, \ but I
have ' demonstrated its success from a
religious standpoint. My congregation
in Chicago has been meeting on Sunday
for nearly thirty years, end it now unm
bers about 1500 at our Sunday services."
Dr. /Hirsch smiled when ha admitted
that he Is known as one of the most
radical rabbis in the United States, and
attributes his reputation to his efforts
in the direction of reforms. \u25a0 He says tha
Jews are drifting away from orthodoxy
and that the* majority of them la this
country are not what might bo called
church-goers. They willingly give finan
cial support to religious Institutions, . but
are not regular attendants at their places
of worship. Of the Russian Jews tha
rabbi said the problem of receiving 1.0C0,
000 refugees from Russia and properly
caring for them in thl3 country during:
the past twenty years had been a serious
one. but the work had been successfully
accomplished. An effort, is now- being
made to persuade many of the Jews ar
riving in this country to take up farm
ing, and toward this end tha Agricultur
ists' Aid . Society has been organized In
Chicago, and is * already accomplishing
much good. - Dr. Hlrsch believes that tha
recent changes in conditions in Russia
will conslderaoly reduce tha Immigration
of Jewish refugees to tha United States
and \u25a0 consequently lessen the j burden jof
work attending their cara in this coun
try. \u25a0 . \u25a0:\u25a0:.-

was followed by speeehmaking.

SAN JOSE, July 12.â The fires that
have been raging in the vicinity of Mount
Hamilton have almost died out. In scat
tered bunches of brush the fire is still
burning, but it \u25a0will be extinguished by
the fire fighters. A heavy cloud of
smoke tangs over the district.
Word reached the Lick Observatory
this morning that the fire was rapidly
burning itself out in the Arroyo Valley
district. Yesterday afternoon the fire
branched off from Its original course and
ran toward the Stanislaus County line.
A number of homes and ranches in its
line were threatened with destruction.
Heavy losses of nheep and cattle have
been reported from the Sycamore dis
trict-
It ia impossible to estimate the losses
from the fire, but fully $60,000 worth of
damage has been done. Many homes
and other buildings have been destroyed
and the loss on cattle will be very
heavy. The loss of the pasture will
come especially hard on the cattle and
sseep men, and it will cause the removal
of many of the herds of stock to other
sections.

France Fails to Prolit by
Her Understanding With
the 'British Government
PARIS, July . 12.â Former Foreign Min
ister Delcaese. in , the course of an inter
view published ,by . the Gaulois to-day
upon the British and French naval
amenities at Brest, said:
The policy of nations nowadays is not based
on sentiment or antipathy, but upon their
material interests. As between Germany and,
Great Britain, our commercial balance shows
where our interests lie. Great Britain is our
best \u25a0 purchaser, while Germany buys almost
nothing of! us and tries to sell us all she can.
Moreover. 1 It is patent that we should not
leave open irritating controversies with Great
Britain which might precipitate an armed
struggle, for Great Britain holds indisputably
the empire of the seas. For every warship
we build she , builds four or five. It is thus
well for us to , accept these manifest facts
and consider the value which British co-opera
tion would give us in certain eventualities. ThÂ«
greatest intrinsic value of such co-operation
would be the virtual impossibility In which it
would place Germany of making war upon us.
Deleasse -was asked if ho considered
the recent menaces in connection . with
Morocco as being seditious. . He . replied?
Not at all. In case of war Great Britain
would surely be with us against Germany
and then "what would the Infant fleet of Ger
many amount to? What would become of her
ports? Of her commerce? Of her merchant
marine? It would mean annihilation. That
la the real significance of the present exchange
of visits of the British and French squadrons.
An understanding between these two pow
ers and a coalition of other navies would cre
ate a machine that neither Germany nor any
other nation would risk conclusions with upon
the sea. . \u25a0 . . -
Continuing,^ Delcasse discussed thÂ»
probable effect of bis policy, if it had
been pursued. Said he:
The Anglo-French cordial understanding was
an achievement toward a definite understand
slng between Russia and Great Britain and
this further understanding . would have been
the work of the French Minister for Foreljra '
Affairs. The success of such . a task would
have strengthened our influence in British,
councils and assured for a long time th*
peace of the world.
In \u25a0â¢ conclusion. Delcasse was asked for
his opinion of France's accepting \ con
ference on Morocco, to which he gayÂ«
the following textual_ response: .
.. To go to a conference is a mistake â and suca
a mistake! \

The weekly financial review of J. S. Bacht
& Co.. New York, says:
"Money continues easy and bids fair to re
raain so over the summer. Although Europe
drew on our cold reserve to the extent of
J1.000.0U0 the consensus of opinion is that
exports of gold to the Continent this year will
b e small in volume. There is a possibility,
however, that France may have to finance a
further Russian loan and the probability of
euch action is increased by the excellent pros
pect of peace being consummated. Further,
the financing of the movement of the crops
is not far distant, and there Is certain to be
a heavy withdrawal of money by Western
bank*. The outlook for raoaey over the fall
is net optimistic and should these unfavorable
influences be accompanied by a bull move
ment In stocks there is every prospect of a
sharp advance in money rates.
Business conditions are excellent. Tlie
.-tee: trade is approaching the usual summer
period of inactivity, but the demand lor
nructural steel and nils Is so heavy that the
mills may be forced to keep running. Steel
p:&te mills have oriers on hand sufficient to
demand their full capacity for months ahead,
and the Eastern plate mills are pushed by
orders for Immediate delivery for the car
bulldi&g companies. Unfavorable reports on
the crops are becoming numerous and will un
doubtedly become more so as the harvest ap
proaches. Notwithstanding the fact that the
pet-nmist will probably have the crops killed
â¢jfT many times before the fall It teems as
sured that the wheat and other cereal crops
will be good. The cotton crop will be smaller
than a year ago, but the corn crop will be
particularly large.
'Stocks have had a substantial rise from
the low level of May, and the buying by
Western interests, so much la evidence in
the late trading of the week, was not nearly
\u25a0o rood as the selling. A moderate reaction
wouid seem Justifiable. Easy money will prob
ably continue over the rummer, but money
rctps will certainly advance sharply In the
fall. The question of the control of railroad
rates which is to come before Congress de-
F*rvrs consideration. The- favorable factor*
of the situation are the general prosperity
ot the country and an all-round Improvement
in the foreign political outlook. Good stocks
are a purchase on recessions anfl will .prob
ably sell much higher, but for the present
we feel inclined to advise conservatism."
Xevr York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July 12.â The report of the
Agricultural Department on the condition of
the cereal crops as of July 1 was of- a sus
taining influence on the prices of stocks to
day .and nerved to protect the market against
the effect of the continuation of yesterday's
profit-taking \u25a0 movement. On the opening rise
in prices' the 1 - -selling of this character was
conspicuous, but with the persistence of the
firmer tone in the market the pressure to cell
became less urgent. The stocks chosen for
the leadership of the recovery were indicative
of the part played by the crop report -on the
movement. The volume of the buying was
very moderate and the decline in the total
ot the day"* sales from the recently prevail
ing average was perhaps the most significant
feature of the market. The movement in the
wheat market was a corrob oration of the im
portance attached to the Government report
on the stock market, and for the first time
in many days the price movement was con
eistent in the stock and commodities market,
wheat declining when stocks advanced.' The
influence of the Government report upon the
markets belied much of the professed distrust
since the cotton leak scandal came into ac
tive discussion and this had some soothing
effect on the fears that the whole basis of
the market operations was in a way to be
come unstable, with a threat of consequent
disorder in the market. The indicated wheat
crop cf over seven hundred million bushels
and the possibility of a bumper corn crop
were accepted as giving full promise of profit
able traffic for the granger railroads. Borne
of the high priced closely held stocks in that
group made wide advances on a light ab
sorption. ThÂ« favorable weather in the spring
wheat region helped the northern grangers.
The failure yesterday to secure a quorum of
Union Pacific directors was regarded from a
revised standpoint as leaving open the pos
sibility of later action foiÂ» increasing the
dividend, and discussion of this probability was
an active factor in the market. The harden
ing of the money market attracted offerings
of foreign funds in this market and the selling
of cxchar.ee bills on this account weakened
the foreign exchange market. The late rise
in Northern Pacific to 201%. thÂ« highest price
since the corner in the stock, was accom
panied by rumor* of an intended extra divi
dend and Just before the close the action
Increasing the Baltimore and Ohio semi-an
nual dividend to 2^4 per cent was announced.
The dosing, in consequence, was firm, but
rather dull.
Bonds were irregular. Total Â»a!ei, par
value, $3,440.000 i
United Etatea bonfls were unchanged on call.

Aevr York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK. July 12.â COTTONâ On easy
cables and bearish feeling the market opened
weak, 10 to 12 points down. Trading was not
as heavy as yesterday, but the market found
good supporting orders on the decline and
shorts became nervous and started to cover,
and prices rallied easily some 25 points, offer-
Ings being very light. The future markets
are now nearer a parity with epot markets
of the South than they have been for the last
three months. Reports from the Southern Cot
ton Growers' Association claim that they have
been advised to hold now for higher prices.
Now the market seeme clear of manipulation,
as speculation geems to be growing to such an
extent that it Is not a oue-man'8 r . market by
any means. . â¢

, "We furthermore find that the pres

tlrely Insufficient for the protection of

In these few words, which form the

tharges no particular person with be
ing responsible for the collapse of the
building-, its report places the blame of
the disaster on the methods of inspec
tion.
The primary cause of the collapse is
itated in the second paragraph of the
findings. Regarding this the report
says:
"We furthermore find that the col
tapse of said building was caused by
Improper bracing of supports of said
building." While this makes the^con-
Jtractor and his men- the agents,' the
actual blame in the matter falls upon
those who are responsible to the public
for the proper erection of buildings and
those who are supposed to see that the
proper precautions are taken during
the course of erection for the safety of
the men working in the buildings.
TELLS OF LAX METHODS.
The remaining portion of the Jury's
findings shows that "Samuel Cowap, 38
J-ea.rs of age, of England, a plumber,
formerly living at 1312 Harrison
Etreet, came to his death en route to
the Central Emergency Hospital from
Injuries caused by the collapse of the
new four-story building in the course
of construction on the northeast corner
t>f Ninth and Tehama streets." No rec
ommendation is made concerning the
change of building laws, which were
shown at the Inquest to be lax in many
particulars.
Building Inspector John P. Horgran
was called to the stand during the
morning and his testimony gave the
greatest weight to the findings of the
Jury regarding the lax methods of the
Board of Works. Horgan stated that
while h* was inspector he had visited
many buildings, of which he made a
cursory inspection, using his own judg
ment regarding the violation of laws,
and testifying that he had no rules or
laws to follow during Inspection. He
attributed the collapse of the Ninth-
Etreet 'structure to the lack of tem
porary braces. He acquitted himself by
caying that the braces were removed
two weeks after his inspection.
SUXSTREAK GAVE WAR\I.\O.
Horgan furthermore Illustrated the
farce of building inspection by swearing
that he visited as many as twenty build-
Ings during a day and that the most time
he could devote to any one was twenty
minutes. He added moreover that dur
ing the day the duties of his position
required him to search out the names
and addresses of owners and other de
tails regarding the properties visited,
so that this shortened the time that
should have been devoted to inspection.
P. J. McDonald, owner "of the build-
Ing at the rear of the one that col
lapsed, told of a conversation with
Contractor Stockholm, In which he told
the latter that the building needed
bracing and said the contractor re
plied, "I guess the building will keep
until I get my money out of it." This
statement Stockholm Indignantly de
nied. John Tamony testified that he
was told by a man named Drlscoll half
an hour before the accident that the
hew building was out of plumb. Mrs.
J. Hadley testified that a streak of
sunlight came in at her window, which
was supposed to be shut off from the
by the new building, and that the
streak -widened and caused her to sup
pose that the buildlnr was not in
plumb.

TALBOTS WIFE
YIELDS POINT
After three days of tireless endeavor
Millionaire William H. Talbot has finally
succeeded: through his counsel In securing
from his wife, Annie, a relinqulshment of
the custody of their little j sons, Willie
and Leroy, . during the /vacation, period.
An agreement to tills eeffcf was reached
late yesterday afternoon -and a truce will
now nrevall until the court reconvenes
about the middle of August. | ,
Yesterday -at 2 o'clock Judge MurasÃy
received Attorney Samuel M. Shortrldge,
representing Mrs. Talbot, and Attorney
W. H. Jordan, representing* Mr. Talbot,
In his chambers. .These' attorneys an
nounced, however, that Mrs. Talbot was
obdurate and would 'consent to no agree
ment . that would j take â¢ her* children from
her side for a snlgle day. let alone a
month or two. Things began to look
rather hopeless, when Judge Murasky di
rected that Mrs. Talbot be summoned' to
a conference to be held at 4:30 o'clock.
At hour -she appeared,- strikingly
gowned in gray and lavender, and was
ushered before the court, | sitting in Judge
Coffey's chambers, by Attorney Short
ridge.
Mr. Talbot was discreetly ' entertained
by his attorney in Judge Murasky's
chambers during . the conference between
Mrs. Talbot and the court. The belliger
ent husband | and wife did not see each
other, with ; the â¢ result that anything ap
proaching a scene was avoided. \ ;
. 'At first Mrs. Talbot refused Jto move
an Inch from . the 'position she had taken
that as the mother ' of her children she
should be given" the sole right to care for
them; that a mother's .love was the only
love that could offer the full measure of
comfort to the innocents. x
"But." explained - the court, ."Mr. . Tal
bot also [ has great affection c for his \ little
ones and pisses ,their, company greatly."
Still Mrs. Talbot remained umoved. Then
.Attorney l Shortridge^ . while- unwilling tto
yield \u25a0 a ; point \ in", favor, ; of ' his ' opponent,
took . up , the " argument. \u25a0 . He is a lawyer
and recognized that the question had ;re
solved itself into ! one of a mother's love,
accentuated by \ pique, pitted against jus
tice and the affection of a father." Finally/
however, as her '\u25a0 pique .- : departed,' ' \u25a0â¢ ] the
scales tipped" beneath ; the weight of, the
father's affection and ". his : -.equitable
rights and -the fight -was. his. \u25a0 \u25a0â¢: â¢ : v
Mrs. Talbot' agreed;;that -Mr. -'Talbot
should have' their, sons'. until such ' time ,' as
the court ? reconvenes after vacation; 'she

A boiler in a French laundry at 514
Central avenue exploded yesterday^ aft
ernoon, and" five persons who were
working there at the time were hurled"
into the air in all directions. Raphael
Monrepos, a laundryman,^ was hurled
through the. windows ( in the front of
the store' arid into the air a distance
of twenty feet. He landed In the mid
dle of the street, a bleeding and bat
tered mass.* Some of the others were
thrown into, the street, while:, others,
were dashed against the sides "of the
walls; but fortunately all these escaped
with minor bruises. The building was
badly damaged. .; "
The explosion occurred a few, min
utes before 3 o'clock. Working in the
laundry at the time of the explosion
were the proprietor. Henri Bourie, and
his wife; R. Bourie, Monrepos and
Marie, Louchrie. ' , : .-j< , â¢ I
There were no premonitory signs of
the explosion. The -boiler burst and
went tearing through the roof. It made
a : hole about six feet in diameter and
landed on an adjoining roof. The build
ing where the explosion occurred prac
tically collapsed. -The windows in the
front were shattered. .Pieces of tho
wreck went crashing against other
buildings in' the vicinity, and.wreck
age could be found fifty feet from the
scene/. /X . ... - '\u25a0 '*', \; \u25a0 - \u25a0

The building. was a one-story struo

BOARD OF EQUALIZERS
ADJUSTS VALUATIONS
Arbitrary Assessment Roll of
Personal Effects Grows
Larger Each Year.
. The : Board of Supervisors met yester
day ;as a Board Equalization |to con
sider the arbitrary assessment list com
piled by Assessor Washington Dodge. A
larger number than last year of | those
who > failed to make a sworn . statement
of their personal taxable effects was re
ported. By â¢ motion of the board an in
crease of 20 per cent will be added to the
assessed valuation^ on the personal prop
erty of all those : assessed tor over $1000
who do not appear before the board at
iti next meeting and show cause why the
valuation should not be increased.
The majority of the taxpayers examined
agreed to make aY sworn statement of
their personal-: property and file it ; with
the Assessor. By doing this the valuation
will be increased "or remain the same, ac
cording' to the latter's judgment. Dr.
Dodge claims : that the ' precedent - created
by the negligence of the property, owners
in not filing this statement makes the
work: of the Assessor less; accurate year
after year.* .
Some of the largest ; taxable ; property
owners on the arbitrary list failed to ap
pear yesterday; and \u25a0 the ' board agreed ' to
send them = one ; more notice. -â¢ ,
; Daniel | Meyer, . the largest owner of
personal effects I not | filed I answered his
name yesterday and r asked v that his ', as
sessment be not raised. The valuation
had been put. at $1,500,000. The'board or
dered it to stand, Reiss .and
Mrs. Kibbe wlir be assessed for the value
set by Dr. Dodge, $150,000.

jiff airs in the Forty-Second
Engage Earnest Attention
of Republican Voters
CAUSE /OF THE REVOLT
Committees of the Twenty-
Eightli and Thirty-Ninth
Districts Elect Officers
The San Francisco Republican League
was organized \by a'i committee of 300
representative men at Pioneer Hall for
the express \u25a0 purpose ; of consolidating all
the forces of ; good citizenship In a' cam
paign for better local government. . It is
the deliberate. judgment ?of thousands of
enterprising wage earners and business
men' that the Ruef-Schmitz , administra-_
tion is a blight onithetcity.. The promot-'
ers "of the'league are endeavoring to,im
press â¢;. upon the public mind the impor
tancefof-; the coming primary election for
the. selection of delegates to the Republi
can nominating j convention, and are also
advising* that concessions be made by one
faction .or , another in order to promote
harmony/ in the cause.
The executive committee of the league
has given' a great \ deal of time to the
adjustment of factional ? disputes In sev
eral of the Assembly districts and the
results in the main have" been accept
able. V '
SITUATION IN PORTV-SECOXD.
,'The leaders of 'the league have not been
able jto bring; about a conciliatory state
of affairs in' the ; Forty-second /Assembly
District, hence an appeal, is made . to the
judgment/of the. Republican voters of
the district. The position of the executive
committee !is defined in the following
resolutions (recently, adopted:
Whereas, George A. McGowan accepted from
the San Francisco Republican League appoint
ment on the committee designated to organize
the -Forty- Second Assembly District in behalf
of a clean city, clean politics and a clean ad
ministration,": and thereafter formed in oppo
sition - to I hi:< associates on j that committee \u25a0 a
club under tha title of -the "Regular "Republi
can Club of the Forty-Second JJietrict" ; and
whereas, the evident result of ''the" formation
of , the so-called "Regular "Republican Club of
the Forty-Second- District" -must-be to divide
the Republican . vote and to endanger the suc
cess of the San Francisco ' Republican League
In that district \u25a0 and the cause for which it
etands; and whereas, Mr. " McGowan \u25a0 has re
fused .to - co-operate with the fellow-members
of the committee appointed by the San Fran
cisco Republican ' Leaxue, - now.
Therefore, * While the San Francisco Repub
lican League deplores the ill-advised ; actions
of Mr. McGowan. and would fain pass -them
over unnoticed, it. feels that the present .un
fortunate situation ' of San | Francisco demands
that no j quarter be shown . to those \ so-called-
Republicans ' who attempt, under a mask, to
weaken an organization | that is sincerely and
earnestly striving . to bring about , an ' honest
and. clean administration for : the welfare. of
San Francisco and its people; and, therefore,
be it :\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0..-.;-\u25a0\u25a0:...':..--..... . \u25a0
Resolved, That the San Francisco Republcian
League announces to the Republican. voters of
the Forty-Second Assembly District that any
alliance with the "Regular Republican Club
of the .:' Forty-Second Assembly District" la
hereby repudiated, and the eald George A. Mc-
Gowan's name is stricken from the rolls of the
league. : â¢: -
The : San Francisco Republican League with
full confidence calls . upon -' the - Republicans of
the Forty-Second Assembly District to give
their , aid and ; support to the organization of
their, district formed by . the I district committee
of the San Francisco Republican \u25a0 League, and
It conjures the citizens of : the Forty-Second
Assembly District to repudiate this perfidious
attempt on the part of Mr. - McGowan to ' de
lvler I them - into . the - hands, of the ,. enemy and
to perpetuate the dishonor of. their city. :\u25a0
Next Saturaay night at . Saratoga Hall
there ; will, be an open meeting of "the
league club.' It is announced that Fair

Daniel A. Ryan, secretary .; of thejexecu
