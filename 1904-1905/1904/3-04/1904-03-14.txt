Although martial law was suspended

NF*V YORK, March 13. â Details
were made known to-day of one of ths
most delicate operations for lockjaw
in the annals of surgery, and one which
has been performed rarely, if ever,
before. It was an operation that
snatched from the grave eleven-year
old John McDonough. When virtually
every other hope had failed, the boy'3
life was saved by the Injection of anti
toxin into the brain. and spinal cavity.
As a result the lad who. six weeks ago
was lylns at the poi_t of death, is to
day well and hearty as ever.
Yo"â McDonough was playing on
a lot near his home when he tripped
and fell, striking hi3 right leu against
the sharp corner (?a rock. Dr. Fran!:
H. Clark decided that the boy showed
symptoms of lockjaw. The lad was
borne to an operating table writhing in
agony. The first operation reduced the
number of spasms. The second reduced
their Intensity. The third relieved him
entirely, and to-day the boy plajr?**
with his companions.

Special dispatches from Port Arthur
say. there are rumors among the Chi

reports that 10,000 Japanese are near

correspondent confirms previous re
ports that it is the intention of Japan
to wait, until the ice breaks up before
making lÂ«rge disembarkations, in order
to avoid difficulties on, the road??. Trans
ports are still arriving, to make good
the deficiencies on the Seoul-Chenrulpo
line, which Jias been denuded of troops,

any great achievement is attempted.

The Yinkow " correspondent of the

putes occur dally between the Russian
navar.and military officers at Port

mer with incomnetency and cowardice.
The, correspondent describes the float

says the dock at Port Arthur is too
small to permit of her repair. General
Stoessel (in. command at Port Arthur)
has been ordered to the Yalu, the cor

Captain Shojiro Asai, commanding
the flotilla of, torpedo boat destroyers
which engaged the Russian destroyers,
Is the Â«hero of the attack. He had only
three destroyers, but attacked six Rus
sian destroyers, ordering his craft;' to
close In .with the enemy. " He'steamed
in so close to the enemy's destroyers
that the vessels almost touched and a
desperate conflict ensued, from- which
the Russians retired badly disabled.
Engineer Minamisawa of- 'the de
stroyer Kasumi. received a' Â¦ mortal
wound. Minamisawa participated in
the first torpedo attack c-n Port Arthur,
and in the attempt to "bottle" the: har-
ATTACKS SUPERIOR IX>RCE.
The closing action .was the bombard
ment of the inner-harbor. by the, Jap
anese battleships. The latter took a po
sition southwest of Port Arthur and
used only their twelve-mch guns. There
v:re twenty-four, twelve-mch gu'ns'in
the squadron of six battleships and each
gun red five rouhde,. making a total of
120 huge projectiles' that were hurled
at the city. The bombardment-.was dK
liberate and carefully calculated.' !
In order to aid in. perfecting the
firing, Admiral Togo stationed the
cruisers In a position due east of the
entrance to the harbor and at a right
angle to the battleships. The cruisers
observed the range and effect of the
firing and signaled the results and sug
gestions by wirelesf telegraphy. These
observations and reports greatly aided
the gunners in their effort to ' make
every shell count. Admiral Togo -was
unable to definitely learn the results
of the bombardment, but later, private
reports indicate that much destruction
was caused in the city, 'where a series
of.flres broke out. There also was seri
ous damage to the batteries. â¢ 'Â¦'. .
BATTLESHIPS IN ACTION.
TOKIO. March 13.â Official and- pri
vate reports both' indicate that Admiral
Togo's fourth attack on Port Arthur,
on March 10, was the njost effective
Eince the first assault, a month ago.
One Russian torpedo-boat destroyer
was sunk and several Russian. torpedo-,
boat destroyers were seriously' dam
aged. The fortifications and ; city rwcre
subjected to a heavy bombardment,'
lasting nearly four hours. ..The naval
bombardments of the land works have
generally been ineffective," yet â¢ the pe
culiar topographical conditions" of .Port
Arthur make immunity from serious
loss from bombardment almost impos
sible. Admiral Togo's torpedo flotilla
opened the action, by .boldly steaming
in under the batteries, and successfully
placing a number of 'mechanical mines
at the mouth of the harbor". Following
that there was a desperate bow-to-bow
encc inter between the torpedo-boat
destroyers, in which the Japanese ap
pear to have scored, a clear victory.
Then followed a long-range duel be
tween the cruisers, \ ending in- the â¢' re
tirement of the Novik and Bayari, the
only Russians engaged.. } .â, : ; :
"Our other flptilla while leaving the
harbor entrance observed two Russian
torpedo-boats: coming from seaward
and immediately engaged them, the
battle lasting one hour. After causing
them severe damage one of them effect
ed its escape, ' but our .; destroyer, ,; the
Sasanami, : captured : the other boat,
which proved to be the, Stereguschtchi.
Notwithstanding the land batteries
pouring a heavy fire on our flotilla, the
captured vessel was -'takenin tow.'
Owing to thVhigh sea the. tow line soon
parted' and the Sasanami found : it
tjÂ«-<-..s.sary to take the crew from the
RUSSIAN CRÂ£\V CAPTURED.
"Our fire greatly damaged the Rus
sian â¢ ships," one of which was badly
crippled by a shot through the, boilers,
and another was observed to be on fire.
So. close -were the two flotillas to each
other that our destroyers, the Asashio,
the Kasumi and the Akatsuki, nearly
touched the enemy's ships and our
crews could even hear the cries of
agony of the wounded men on them.
We sustained some damage and ;ioss.
The, Akatsuki had a steam pipe broken
and' four stokers were killed thereby.
Our loss was seven killed and eight
wounded. Among the latter is Chief
Engineer Minamisawa of the Kasumi.
'Our squadron, as "prearranged, at
tacked the enemy at Port Arthur on
March 10. Our two,, torpedo flotillas*
reached^ the mouth of the harbor at
Port Arthur afl o'clockon the morning
of the' 10th. Finding no enemy and
waiting until dawn, one flotilla engaged
in sinking special mines In the harbor
entrance. Notwithstanding the enemy's
fire. our, Uotilla* succeeded in sinking the
mines. The other flotilla met the en
emy's torpedo flotilla, consisting of six
boats, in the Laqthieshan channel;
south of. Port Arthur, at 4:30 p'clock:
A hot engagement occurred at close
range for, thirty minutes. The enemy
then took flight. -

The autopsy showed that the course
of the bullet was downward. Indicating
that Cummings had been shot while
in a kneeling attitude with his hands
raised above his head, the assassin
standing over him when he fired.
The warrants issued to-night charge
the accused with the general crime of
felony. Cowan is in the Hakersneld
jail.
Albert Irwin and Fred Fry, railroad
employes, testified that a boy, appar
ently a tramp, informed them Friday
that the negro, Cummings, assaulted
him with a pistol and committed a
serious effense. The negro appeared a
minute later and was then putting a
pistol In hi3 pocket. An ofticer was
called, but the boy disappeared.
There is not a scintilla of evidence
against the negro, who denied the
charge and gave a perfectly straight
account of himself and his actions.
The remains of the murdered man lay
all day in the anteroom of the jail.
A heavy crowbar used to pry open the
jail door, a railroad lantern bearing the
stamp of the Southern Pacific Company
and a can of lubricating oil stand by
the side of the corpse. â¢',
The officers believe they have a good
case against the suspected Iyncher3
and expect to secure their conviction.

Cowen went to his lodging-house, got
a rifle and left, after making a remark,
about "having some fun with a nigger."

one of the three car barn bandits now
tinder sentence of death, declared in a
confession made to-day that he was one
of the three men who held up the Chi

near DekaJb, four years ago. The
crime, which has passed into history
as one of the most desperate ever com
mitted in or about Chicago, has never
been fastened upon any one.
Marx raya both his confederates in
the robbery are dead and he refuses to
give their names. One of them, he de
clares, "died with his boots on." The
railway authorities admitted a loss of
1102,000 by the robbery.
Marx says the robbers secured only

"From a political point of view the
United States has gocd reason to fear
that the hostile nature of- American
and British behavior will force Russia
to throw. herself into the arms of Ger
many," says the Soyet,"ln commenting
on the attitude of the United States.
"It is known that military circles in
the United States are convinced that
their next war will be with Germany.
They recall the Venezuelan blockade.
If the German fleet had been sufficient
ly strong at that time, war would have
broken out between Germany and the
United States. Germany' drew back,
but she has not renounced 'her world
policy nor her cherished designs on
weak South American republics.
"Concerning the furtively whispered
story of a treaty between Germany and
Russia, it may be simply stated that It
is untrue; but, on the other hand, there
will be nothing to wonder at when
Americans come to think of it, If for her
friendly services in the. present circum
stances Germany should also bargain
for". Russia's I services . in the J event * of
her war with the United States.
. "Bismarck, â¢ in ; directing hostilities
agaihst Russia and organizing a coali
tion' againstr -France, established a
Franco-Russian alliance, and America
may do' a similar thing if it imitates
Bismarck's policy."
SAYS AMERICA'S
NEXT WAR WILL BE
WITH GERMANY
All is quiet at Port Arthur and Vladi
vostok. There are no Japanese troops
anywhere In Manchuria and only small
patrols of the enemy are to be seen in
Northern Korea. â¢ :
The fifteenth army corps at' Moscow
and the tenth army corps at Kharkoff
will start for Far East in a few days.
After the war these two corps will re
turn to their stations, but the other
troops that are already in the Orient
will remain permanently In the Asiatic
provinces. ( ; ,
The circulation here of an untrue re
port to the effect that the Washington
Cabipet has decided to support the pro
test of the commander of the United
States gunboat Helena, now at New
chwang, against the action of the Rus
sian authorities in sinking Chinese
junks in the channel of the Liao River,
and that Washington would notify
Russia that the neutrality of New
chwang must be respected, has created
something of a flurry.
The Novoe Vremya makes this the
subject of an editorial entitled "More
Ameripan Meddling," in which it is
ccntended that as Newchwang is with
in Manchuria and is only six miles from
the railroad to Port Arthur, "Russia has
a perfect right to take defensive meas
ures there, and that unless the United
States is seeking a cause for a quarrel
It would not insist upon supporting the
protest of the commander. Fortunately
a denial of this story reached here to
night in time to head oft what might
haveproved a fresh cause of irritation.
ST. PETERSBURG," March 13.â A
telegram received here from General
Zhlinsky, General Kuropatkin's chief of
staff, says that, according to reports
published in Korean newspapers, 18,0p0
Japanese have landed at Chenampho,
Korea, and are marching to Pingyang.
Five hundred Japanese are said to have
landed at Kienghueng, on the north
.east coast of Korea.
CANARD EXCITES
RUSSIANS AGAINST
THE UNITED STATES
â¢ The press is assured by a high au
thority that all official telegrams al
ways have been. given out accurately,
in so far as their sense was concerned,
and in most cases textually, although
occasionally words have been changed
where the original words were subject
to misconstruction. For instance, in
one case the words "the enemy was at
our heels" were altered to read "the
enemy was behind us," lest the' official
language should give the ignorant
the impression that the Russians were
flying before the Japanese.
Even the habitual critics of the Gov
ernment have been astonished at the
manner in which the authorities are
taking the people into their confidence
in the war, and this policy of fair deal
ing would seem to be uniting the na
tion as never before in her history.
General Kuropatklri's open warning
to the people, in his speech to the.Mu
nicipal Council, not to expect too much
at first; but to exercise patience, is an
evidence of the frankness with which
the people are being treated. The ut
terances of the general on that occas
ion were commended" warmly by the
press as much better than-. glittering
promises which might not be redeemed.
The Emperor and the Empress and
their children sppnt to-day at Tsar
koye Selo and went sleigh riding in the
park. To-morrow the imperial family
will resume its fast, the fourth week
in Lent, like the first and last, being
rigorously observed.
It was an appeal to the sentimental
side of the Russian character which
has been more than justified. Hitherto
the Government has considered it un
wise to give the people information
freely at critical moments and the
result was that the people, being pe's
simistic, were often inclined to imagine
things to be much worse than they
really were. ,
ST. PETERSBURG, March 13.â
The confidence displayed by the Rus
sian people in the reports of the Gov
ernment on the progress of the fighting
in the Far East, which is one of the
most notable features in Russia of the
war, has thus far been largely due to
an entire change-of policy Instituted by
the Emperor some time ago with the
abolition of the censorship on foreign
newspaper, dispatches. This abolition
was followed, when the war broke out,
by the Emperor's decision to make
public, as fully as possible, all reports
regarding the war in the the belief
that the loyalty of his subjects would
be only strengthened by acquainting
them with the truth in victory or de
feat.
NEW YORK, March 13.â That Eng
land is sending not a few of her army
officers to the Far East is apparent to
any one who scans the passenger lists
of incoming steamships, and much
speculation is aroused thereby. It was
only two weeks ago that General Wil
liam Nicholson, chief of the intelligence
department of the British War Office,
passed through New York on his way
to Tokio, accompanied by Lieutenant
Colonel Haldane as his aid. The des
tination of several British officers who
have since landed here has been- the
same.
On the steamship St. Paul of the
American line, which arrived to-day,
was Colonel Apsley Smith of the Royal
Field Artillery, who, beyond admitting
that he was going to Tokio, would not
discuss his mission. He is accompa
f nied by Mrs. Smith. MaJ[. Sitwell of the
British army was another passenger
on the St. Paul.
Lieutenant G. H. Betton-Foster. of
the Royal Artillery and Lieutenant F.
S. G. Piggott of the Royal Engineers,
who had among their baggage a com
plete field equipment, were among the
passengers on the Umbria of the Cu
nard line, arriving here this morning.
Both are under orders to report to
General Nicholson in Tokio.
Hon. Florence Cloborne, who was a
passenger on the St. Paul, is going to
Tokio to engage in^ Red Cross work
with the Japanese army in the field.
Prince Nashlmoto of Japan, who is
related to the imperial family and who
is hastening back to his country to take
the field, arrived to-day on the' Umbria.
The Prince, who is traveling incognito,
came under the name of "Mr. Nagai"
and registered at the Holland House
under one of his titles. Count Tada.
The Prince is a captain in the in
fantry of the Imperial Guards and for
the past year has been studying the
French language in Paris. Accompany
ing the Prince was Major Yamaue of
the general staff and Captain Inouye
of the infantry, who also have been
studying in Paris.
The Prince and his companions will
sail from Vancouver on March 24.
Special Dteratch to ThÂ« Call
RUSSIAN PEOPLE
NOT MISINFORMED
BY GOVERNMENT
PARIS, March 14.â "It is almost cer
tain," telegraphs 'the. St. Petersburg
correspondent of. Gil Bias, "that the
Emperor will assume command of the
troops in the Far Bast after the first
important engagement."
From other Russian sources it is
learned that the Czar appears to have
definitely made, up his mind to go to
the fr.ont.
It is affirmed in Paris that Prince
Itchijo, naval attache to the Japanese
legation, will leave France shortly as a
result pt a conference between Foreign
Minister Delcasse and Japanese Min
ister Motono on the subject of the Mar
tin treason case. Martin is now under
arrest. He was employed in the Min
istry of Marine and is said to have at
tempted to sell French naval secrets to
the Japanese Minister. It is alleged
that Martin also sold important official
documents to an Italian ' attache, whor
since has been recalled; . V '
Riots have occurred at Tszechau and
Lunwan, along the line of the Beleian
Railroad in the Southern part of Shansl
province. A Frenchman named Perlon
has. been captured by a mob and fears
are entertained for his safety. -Roma,
an Italian, fought his way out of the
same mob. It is reported that twenty
foreigners employed along the railroad
are in danger.
Information from an official who was
an eye-witness of 'the bombardment of
Port Arthur on Wednesday and Thurs-*
day is to the effect that the Russians
had twenty-flve killed on the .battle
ship Sevastopol, twenty on the Retvi
zan and twenty in the town. .The Rus
sians claim . to have sunk a Japanese
cruiser..
The Russians assert that their dam
aged cruisers have been repaired and
are ready for sea. The battleship
Cesarevitch will be ready shortly. There
is no dock there capable of taking in
the Retvizan. . %
The Russians are preparing for the
defense of Newchwang, finding it im
â¢possible to stop the landing of the Jap
anese. . ' .
The. action of Vice Admiral Makaroff
on the cruiser Novik in taking a por
tion of -the .fleet. but of. the harbor on
Friday morning appealed to the pat
riotism and excited the admiration of
the garrison.
The food supply of Port Arthur is
reported to be about normal, though it
is necessary to govern prices by ordi
nance. Three merchants have been
punished for raising prices. The French
caviare restaurants and the Russian
cafe' - chantant are running and the
naval band plays in the park? daily.
Replying to the inquiry of the com
mander of a- foreign gunboat at New
chwang, the civil administrator charac
terized the report of Russia's intention
to ' block the Laio River by sinking
junks as calumnies.
The latest report from Fungwang
cheng, brought by a courier of the
regular native courier service, who left
that place on March 8, states that thera
were no Japanese there or in that vi
cinity. Therefore the reports of en
counters at the outposts there must be
discredited.
LOSSES OF THE RUSSIANS.
A Russian refugee who arrived here
to-day throws valuable additional .light
on the bombardment of Port Arthur
last Thursday. # He says that the &t
tack was intende'd for the forts, but the
Japanese* fire overreached. There was
small destruction, and the casualties
were not numerous. Twenty soldiers
and two civilians were killed and three
civilians injured. Colonel Vershlnin,
Governor of Port Arthur, was slightly
wounded. The ."Japanese used 300 or
400 Russian shells, which they found
on the captured transport Manchuria.
The refugee says only four Japanese
cruisers were actively engaged, i The
forts replied with several shots, when
ever the Japanese left the cover of the
Laothieshan ' promontory.. Besides the
Retvizan, the .battleship Petropolavsk
received slight damage from ashot.

VIENNA. March 13.â Reports have
been received here from Sofia, Bulgaria,
that revolutionary circles are stirred up
In consequence of the attitude of the
Sultan on the gendarmerie question,
and it is believed that the revolutionists
are prepared for a new outbreak. The
Zontcheff party has directed its sup
porters to commence the collection of
arms and money, and the internal or
gan has sent messages to Macedonia
to ascertain what preparations for a
fresh campaign are being made.
No open revolution is expected be
cause of the presence of a large Turk
ish force, but activity on the part of
the revolutionary bands soon may be
evidenced.
It was not until Baron Rosen and his
establishment left Tokio this evening
that anything like dicourtesy was at
tempted and then it was sharply re-
When the head of the column halt
ed all those behind stopped also, and
there was no crowding forward. Each
seemed perfectly willing to wait pa
tiently for his turn to stand before the
gate and cheer. When those at the
head had cheered enough to satisfy
them for a while they moved on.
When the next section stopped those
in the lead waited also. There was no
hurry anywhere, no crowding and
pushing. It was a fine, clear, starlit
night, dark enough to give full effect
to the lantern display, which was very
fine. All over the spacious grounds in
front of the palace there were lanterns
carried by persons who did not care
to join the marching column, and the
great mass of them, with those in the
column, was like a multitude of giant
fireflies swayed about by a gently
moving breeze.
Only the students had attempted to
make more show than by the use of
lanterns. They, had rigged up. a few
transparencies.* About these there
was the only pushing along â¢ the
column. The outsiders were so anx
ious to get close enough to read the
inscriptions that the boys were unable
to hold their transparencies against
the rush.' So they employed a couple
of stout wrestlers for each transpar
ency, and after that the- crowd might
Fhove as it would with no damage to
the display. A few banners -with long
inscriptions were also carried?
It took nearly two hours for all the
paraders to cheer themselves out In
front of the palace, for ther^ were three
or four thousand of them. When they
finally got away they went down to the
Navy Department and repeated the
performance. But here they were not
so slow. Perhaps their throats were
tired with yelling, ifrom the Navy
Department the procession broke up,
the paraders going away in little
groups, as they had come, scattering
through the streets back to their
homes, but still carrying their lanterns
and still with a husky cheer at the
slightest provocation. It was after
midnight before the grounds around
the department buildings were cleared
of the lantern bearers.
I During all this demonstration the
Russian legation, which is close to the
Navy Department, was dark. There
was no sign of a demonstration from
any of the paraders or others about
the legation buildings. To be sure, the
police were keeping sharp lookout to
prevent any show of disturbance, but
there was no occasion for! their inter
ference, i - ..... ~ '"
At the gate in front of the Imperial
Palace the head of the procession halt
ed. The paraders pressed against the
gate and the railings that guard the
moat and cheered and waved their
lanterns frantically. From thefjalace
there was no sign that any one within
knew anything of what was going on.
The building itself could not be distin
guished in the dark from the gate, but
that did not diminish the enthusiasm
of the marchers in the least.
MARCH TO THE PALACE.
At that hcur, wherever one went
I about the city, little groups of men and
boys, and even women and children,
were seen hurrying along to the meet
ing place. They carried for the most
part gay lanterns of bamboo and paper,
all decorated with red lines or figures
! on the white paper. These were sus
pended from lc-ng, slender strips of
bamboo, so that they were swung over
the heads of those who carried them
and bobbed back and forth as the peo
ple walked. â¢ ?
"OLD GLORY" BORNE ALOFT.
Now and then flags were carried with
the lanterns, for the most part the
white flag with red ball center which
is the national flag of Japan, but some
times the rising sun banner of the army
and navy. Occasionally also a Union
Jack or the Stars and Stripes showed
where some marchers appreciated the
friendship of Great Britain and ' the
United States.
And now, too, there were cheers. I
had begun to think the Japanese had
forgotten how to cheer, but the ban
zais that went up last night were more
than enough to remove that suspicion.
Even the children showed that they
could yell as well as their elders. The
crowd rushing through the streets met
every ricksha with banzais, and the
foreigner who looked like an American
or an Englishman was followed where
ever tie went by plenty of cheers.
By 7 o'clock Hibiya Park was crowd
ed with paraders. The students of the
military and naval schools were out en
masse, and they carried torches instead
of lanterns. Two or three band's had
been engaged also and' songs had been
improvised for the occasion. In a re
markably orderly fashion the proces
sion was formed at the park and began
to march toward the grbunds of the
Imperial Palace.
There was no attempt at regular or
ganization, but of their own accord and
as suited them best the people fell in
in a very good column and marched
along. Part of the time it was column
of fours, sometimes more and some
times fewer. They marched When they
felt like it and stopped when they
pleased to cheer or sing.
On the flanks of the column hung
throngs of men and women who were
not carrying lanterns or torches, but
who proceeded with the column and
were in fact part of it. Mounted po
licemen, carrying red and white lan
terns, rode along with the column, but
there was no occasion for the display
of their authority. The crowd was
good natiired and orderly throughout.

BY OSCAR KING DAVIS.
TOXIO. Feb. 11.â The pall of solemn
secrecy that has been hanging over the
Japanese capital for more than a month
vas lifted yesterday, and a ray of real
enthusiasm broke through.
A great change came over Tokio. The
stoics dropped their masks and re
waled themselves as human beings
With human emotions, subject to
human excitement. They came out of
their shells and gathered in the streets
tind talked and laughed and cheered
and acted just as any other people
vould who have received news of a
great naval victory over a powerful en
tmy. Their joy was real and infectious
and they exhibited it with spirit and
dignity.
iiut the contrast to the silence and
repression of the previous days was all
the more remarkable. That period of
waiting had almost fitted me to believe
that the Japanese would go through
the entire war with owl-like, unbroken
placidity, no matter what they won,
but now 1 am ready to admit that they
can give way to popular feeling when
the emergency arises*
It was all started by the receipt of
reports from the main squadron of the
navy, under Admiral Togo, to the ef
fect that a battle had been fought off
Port Arthur and a great victory Avon.
For a day or two there had been
i utnurs tr.at something interesting was
going on or about to happen. It was
known that the squadron had left
base bo. where it had been for so long,
but only guesses were heard as to iis
destination.
NEWS 1HK1LLS THE CITY.
The secrecy that had prevailed took
en Â«n added character. It became al
most breathless. Then, on the evening
ct the fth. suddenly, from no particular
I'oint but everywhere at once, the word
came that there had been a tight at
Chernuii'.o and that the Japanese had
won. " Tne iiussians had lost two ships,
une ot them the fine new American
built cruiser Variag, the other the little
gunboat Koreitz.
A little ripple of enthusiasm started
on a cautious round ot the city, and,
meeting with a friendly reception, suc
ceeded in inducing others to come out
so that by midnight there was a fair
fchow of interested excittment, and the
He-count of the engagement had grown
to the to-be-expected proportions.
Then came the big news yesterday
morning. The Japanese squadron had
come up to Fort Arthur and found the
liussian ships outside the harbor. In
the darkness of midnight the Japanese
lurptdo boats had sneaked into the en
trance of the harbor, getting behind the
Kussiun ships. Then Togo's fighting
line closed in.
The Russians endeavored to retire
into the harbor and were met in the
mouth hy the torpedoes. Three were
destroyed at once, the flagship Czar
evitch, the first-class American-built
battleship Retvizan and the big cruiser
Pallada. The Russians drew off to
wait for daylight, leaving the Japanese
in possession of the entrance to the
harbor. There the report left Togo,
standing between the Russian, and his
base and defying the enemy to come
on.
It was beautiful strategy, that of this
report, for it left the Japanese admiral
eaying to the Russian. "It is either you
or I now." If it were true, it meant
that the Japanese had cleared the Rus
eians from the sea at the first encoun
ter, and v.ere free to do their will un
interfered with in the matter of landing
troops.
There was no definite authority for
thle report. The naval authorities at
the department maintained their silence
and simply replied to all questioning
that there had been no report from
Admiral Togo. Still, every man you
met assured you that it was an abso
lute fact, and details were promptly
forthcoming.
The Jiji Shimpo. which has the repu
tation of being the most reliable news
paper of Tokio, got out an extra, say
ing that the information had -been re
ceived by a "certain department" from
a reliable source, which might have
meant anything. But there was
enough' for the people to go on.
FIJVGS FLAMED EVERYWHERE.
Flags appeared as if by magic all
around the city. In the streets there
were long double lines of them hang
ing: from the windows of the shops and
dwellings. Some of the more excitable
of the people carried little ones about,
arid many wore them In buttonhole or
hatband. The soldiers of the reserve,
who now flock about the streets, had
no question for the accuracy and re
liability of the news. They accepted
Jt eagerly and congratulated one an
other vigorously.
Thf-n. about noon, came certain con
firmation of the fact that there had
been a fight. The captain of a British
ehip reported at Chefoo that on leaving
Port Arthur he had seen two squad
rons at it, and that the Russians had
ioft two battleships and a cruiser.
The undemonstrative Japanese let
thomselves go after that. Word went
around that there would be a lantern
and torchlight procession in the even
ing, and the flags multiplied them
relvcs. The wild men, who peddle
extras, dashed about the streets, clang-
The Temps' has published an inter
view with Kurino, the late Japanese
Minister to Russia, who is quoted as
saying that there is no doubt the Jap
anese Government decided to sever dip
lomatic relations with Russia on Janu
ary 31, when, in answer to repeated In
quiries, Count Lamsdorf, the Russian
Foreign Minister, informed Kurino that
the Czar had not yet reached a decision
v/lth regard to thÂ« reply of Russia to
the latest Japanese note.
In response to a question Kurino said
he did not believe the report that Baron
Hayashi, the Japanese , Minister to
Great Britain, had endeavored to force
a rupture between Japan and Russia.
The only thing responsible for the rup
ture, he said, was the anxiety caused
by Russia's prolonged' silence. â¢
The news that! the Russian reply had
been sent too late to affect the situa
tion-was published on the evening of
February 4 and the instructions of
Kurino to break off relations with Rus
sia reached him on the morning of Feb
ruary 5.
Discussing the events that led up to
the breaking out of hostilities Kurino
said that Russia had not sufficiently
appreciated the state of popular feel
ing in Japan, and moreover, although
the peaceful disposition of the Czar
and Count Lamsdorff was -not ques
tioned, the spirit of the Russian mil
itary authorities in the Far East was
rot peaceful.
Kurino said he believed that Viceroy
"Their attacks are audacious, but al
ways ineffective," he said. "The bom
bardments are always of the same
fashion at about the same hour, of
about the same duration and in full
daylight. Their strategy lacks va
riety. This probably is due to the
comparative youthfulness of the Japan
ese navy organization.
"It is noticeable that Admiral Maka
roff's report says that he hoisted his
flag on the Novik, which had been rep
resented as out of commission from
damages, and it is also notable that he
says our ships are ready to resume the
struggle. With Admiral Makaroff com
manding we expect sharp, aggressive
action."
Pierre Gifford, writing to the Matin
from Port Dalny, graphically describes
the country and the conditions. While
traveling from the north he saw oceans
of snow stretching oft in every direction,
suggesting, terrible hardships endured
during the' military concentration now
going on. Below Mukden the snow had
almost disappeared and the plains were
being cultivated by the Chinese.
Martin, the non-commissioned offi
cer accused of having disposed of
French naval secrets to a Japanese na
val attache, was lengthily interrogated
yesterday. The proceedings were se
cret. The magistrate in charge of the
case has summoned the general staff to
testify on Monday. The staff is serious
ly concerned over the document Martin
obtained. In the investigation he indi
cated that general instructions for war
times were among those documents. Â¦
WHY JAPAN BEGAN WAR.
The Petit Parislenne published a dis
pa.tch from St. Petersburg this morning
saying that a Russian squadron, com
posed of the battleships Oslabya,
Almaz and Alexander III., the cruisers
Dmitri Donskoi and Aurora and a
number of torpedo-boats and sub
marine vessels will go to the Far Eas,t
in May. Two submarine vessels are
being constructed at Port Arthur, the
correspondent continues, and six are
being built on the Neva.
According to the St. Petersburg cor
respondent of the Echo de Paris. Gen
eral Poulivanoff, manager of the
Russky Invalid of St. Petersburg, said
in an interview that Russia was pre
pared to make every sacrifice to pun
ish the Japanese and had not underes
timated the enemy, whose fighting
qualities undoubtedly were consider
able. The general expected serious
fighting on the Yalu River within a
week.
The Russian naval attache here,
commenting on the Port Arthur bom
bardment of March 10, points out the
similarity of the four Japanese attacks
â destroyers by night and bombard
ments by day.
XO CHANGE IN TACTICS.
SQUADRON TO BE SENT.
The suggestion comes from one of
the most prominent railroad men, who
probably has the largest railroad deal
ings with Russia of any American.
During a recent visit here he called at
the American Embassy and other of
ficial quarters. In the course of hi3
visit he strongly urged that France
and the United States, by reason of the
international friendships toward the
two belligerents, were especially quali
fied to initiate a peace movement
The suggestion was entirely unoffi
cial and formal; but, nevertheless, it
was expected that it would prove a
germ for official action. However, no
such official action is likely at the pres
ent time, as it is the accepted view of
the- French and American authorities
that neither of the belligerents would
listen to any peace overtures.
PARIS, March 13.â The informal sug
gestion that France and the United
States act Jointly as peacemakers In
the Far Eastern war has been made
within the last week and, although the
officials consider that any peace over
tures would be futile at the present
stage of the conflict, yet the suggestion
leads to the belief In very high quar
ters that France and the United States
will become the peacemakers.
PARIS, March 14.â The Figaro this
morning prints an Interview with a
person of much importance in the dip
lomatic world who declares that al
though the recent rumors of probable
mediation between Russia and Japan
are premature, the positive denials of
these rumors are equally baseless.
-, "I can assure you," this person says,
"that, favored by the comparative calm
which prevails at this moment, a most
acute change of views is going on be
tween European cabinets.
"The chancellories have begun to
play the part of 'international firemen';
in other words, they are trying to re
strict the spread of the conflagration
and to protect adjoining states."
After referring to the wild rumors
that have been circulated of late, the
Informant of the Figaro said in con
clusion:
"One thing remains. certain, namely,
the new and striking affirmation of
the close friendship uniting Nicholas
II and King Edward VII. Everywhere
peace is desired and governments are
working for it with all their strength.
"China Is not a source of danger.
The Empress and court hate Japan.
The treaty of Shimonoseki has not
been forgotten and, moreover, the race
question in Asia has not the import
ance which Europe attributes to it."

Arthur Fight.
No Action to Be Taken Until Belligerent Na

Vice Admiral Togo's report to Toklo of his bombardment on Thursday and - the ' accompanying sea
fight proves the engagement ,to have been one of the most desperate in which the warships have taken
part. Great courage was displayed on both sides, especially in the close-range work of the torpedo craft,
and there is no doubt serious damage was inflicted upon both the town and the Russian fighting craft in
side the liarbor. The vice admiral's report 'contradicts the reports from the Russian side.
As predicted by The Call at the time, the report that a Japanese army had landed at Ant ting, defeated
a Russian force and .captured Fungwangcheng,' appears, to' haVe been entirely unfounded. Xo Japanese
have appeared between the Yalu River aijd the Manchurian Railroad, according to advices from various
points in the vicinity. It appeared incredible that the Japanese should seize a position between two
strong forces of Russians, thus subjecting themselves to the danger of a combined .attack that might mean
their annihilation.
The consular body at Chefu, comprising the representatives of the non-combatant powers, has given
n practical hint that the neutrality of China must be respected. Japanese placards Inciting the Chinese
against Â¦ the Russians were torn down by the Consuls and the attention of the Peking Government called to
the ii flair.
Sinister influences are still at work in an endeavor to embroil . the American*- and Russian Govern
ments. A false report cabled to Russia, to the effect that the United States had determined to declare the
neutrality of Xewchwang, now held by Russian troops and which is, of great strategical importance, be
cause of its proximity to the Manchurian Railroad,' caused much excitement in tlie Czar's capital. The
canard was quickly denied, but not before the irritable Russian press had launched a broadside of denun
ciation at this Government for its alleged medtllingl

The report gained currency in the Far East yesterday that the Russians' had decided.to evacuate Port

FEAIt FOR THE SAFETY
OF AN OVERDUE STEAMER
This kind of weather went on up to
the 10th of October, during which time
the vessel had lost nineteen sails. It
was now three weeks that the ship had
been trying to round the Horn and had
buen combating with the elements.
Captain, officers and crew were ex-
LOSES NINETEEN' SAILS.
The British chip Palls of Halladale.
Captain D. W. Thomson, arrived In
port yesterday after a terrible expe
rience on the high seas. Storms, hur
ricanes and every fury of the elements
combined against the ship as she
neared the Horn, but these were only
secondary to the disorder, confusion
and mutiny that reigned among a por
tion of the crew, headed by one of the
seamen named Thomas Mooney. For
thirty-eight days the Captain was
obliged to keep Mooney in irons before
he would resume duty and give up his
mutinous ideas.
The ship sailed from Liverpool on
July 25, bound for this port with a gen
eral cargo composed of pig iron, salt,
soda and other merchandise. The
weather was fairly smooth until Sep
tember 24, when they were off Diego
Ramirez Island, when the wind com
menced to rage and high seas set in.
Just as they were off the pitch of the
Horn, they experienced all kinds of
weather. The next day, when they
were in the Straits of Lemaire, they
sighted a four-masted baTk ashore. On
September 28 they ran into a hurricane
which seemed to come from every
point of the compass, seas continually
washing the decks of the ship with
great fury.
When we were off Cape Horn, and every man
was working night and day, with the ship
flooded with water, trying to keep the vessel
afloat, some of these mutinous men would
sneak away and hide where it was almost im
possible to find them. I am glad that we are
in port. As you will see by looking at the
ship, she has had a tough experience. Her
main royal mast, and mlzzen royal yard are
gone, havinsr been swept away t>y thÂ« heavy
galPB Bho lias hern through.
At the height of. the fight at that place a
party of eentlemen happened to be cruising
In that locality on a pleasure yacht, and, see
ing th'at I was in distress, they came on board
my ship. When 1 informed them that eight
of my crew had refused work and were de
termined to go on shore, they went among
them and told them that the moment they set
foot In Invercargil they -would be arrested and
thrown into Jail. This seemed to pacify them
for the moment, but when the visitors lert
the ship, the men. under the leadership of
Mooney. again demanded to be al
lowed to quit the vessel and upon my refusal
they refused to go to work and went sulking
to their bunks. Therefore, there was no al
ternative for me than to put them in irons and
set sail.
SHIP BADLY DAMAGED.
ley W. Bryant, John Hardy, John Aus
nig, Andrew Ellison, Thomas Mooney
and B. Williams. The captain then or
dered the anchor to be weighed. This
was no easy matter, for the reason that
the c-ther members of the crew sym
pathized to some extent with the mu
tinous element. After forcible persua
sion on the captain's part, with the
help of the other officers, the ship
finally got under way, headed for this
port. The second day out from Inver
cargll the mutinous crew, with the ex
ception of Mooney, promised to go to
work and were consequently released.
The rest of the voyage was practically
uneventful. On March 1 the British
ship Naiad was sighted and a further
supply of provisions was obtained from
her.
Captain Thomas, in speaking of the
trip, said:
I have been goiiiK to sea for a great many
years and this was one of the most tem
pestous voyages I have rver experienced. The
rtorms off Cape Horn were of terrible vio
lence and for three weeks we were almost
practically at the mrrcy of the terrible suc
cession of hurricanes we ran Into. Of course
the vpsspI must have suffered from the ter
rific strain she was laboring under, and from
the terrible seas that kept pounding on her
decks. It Is Impossible for me to state any
thing about the cargo, but naturally It must bfi
moro or less In a damaged condition. We have
a quantity of salt in sacks on board and this,
of course, has suffered. The Foda must also
be damaged. The experience st Invercargil
was a bitter one, end ii whs a hard fight for
me to keen the crew in order.
Even then the mutinous part of the
crew refused to go to work, so the cap
tain was compelled to put in irons

Another sea struck-the ship and car
ried away the' standard compass, so
the captain was obliged to steer by
boats compass. The hatch tarpaulins
were washed overboard. The seas were
running mountains high, the weather
was intensely cold, and the air was
filled with blinding snow. To relieve
the vessel, which was straining heavily,
oil was poured on the sea. All hands
were up to their necks in water. Grog
was served every two hours In order to
keep the crew at work. By this time
fresh water on board was going short,
and the crew commenced to show signs
of becoming mutinous. The weather
had abated somewhat and the captain
decided to- run for Foveaux Straits, and
on January 1 came to anchor off Inver
cargil, New Zealand. Here eight of
the crew broke into open mutiny, re
fused to work and demanded to be al
lowed to go on shore and quit the ship.
Mooney was the ringleader of the gang
and was practically the inciter of the
others in the rebellion. The steamer
Teresa Ward came out from shore,
which was about thirteen miles dis
tant and brought a supply of fresh
water and Jrovisions.

has the explicit promise of the Navy
Department that the naval coaling sta

coaling stations is contained in the reg

to the location. It is for that reason
that the promise made to the Senator
becomes Important.

five men from Mare Island proceed
hither with a steam launch for the pur
pose of commencing the necessary pre

Already I had begun to doubt seriously

BERKELEY, March 13.â Five hun

in song at the concert to be given on
March 26 in the Greek theater at the
University of California, the object be
ing to raise money to pay for furnish
ing the juvenile room in the new Car
negie library. Rehearsals are being
held in all the public schools twice a
week now for this big affair and soon
the children will practice altogether in
the theater afternoons. Every school
is furnishing its quota of songsters, the
number training in the various. schools
being as follows:
Whittier, 100; Le Conte, 60; Lincoln,
80; McKInley, 130; San Pablo, 35; Co
lumbus, 10; Allstonway. 60; Longfellow,
60. The total is 500.
Mrs. L. V. Sweesy, supervisor of mu
sic in the schools, is directing the re
hearsals. She has selected a number
of pretty songs and given them to the
children to- practice. She goes to each
school on certain days of the week to
give them instruction. It will be her
endeavor to develop the dramatic ele
ment in the children and thus make
them feel what they are singing.' In
this way she will be able to get more
emphasis on the expression and at the
same time bring out the sentimental
side of the children's natures.
The great chorus of 500 voices will
not compose the whole show, for two
glee clubs have been formed to sing a
number of songs. One is a mixed club
of fifty voices from the McKinley
school and the other Is of the same
number from the Whittier school. These
clubs have been practicing upon a
new lot of glees that will amuse the
people.

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
The small stiiwe to-day was a bower or
green, palms and ferns being banked in the
background.
The children who represented the flowers
were appropriately costumed In different col
ors and the very excellent manner in which
they carried out the parts assigned gave evi
dence not only of their own cleverness, but of
the admirable manner in which they had been
trained. The cantata was given under the di
rection of Miss Florence Nightingale and the
children were assisted by Miss Marlon Smith,
who was the Flower Queen, and Miss May
Coogan. The. Queen's two little attendants
were ..the source of considerable amusement.
One, in Placing the crown on Miss Smith's
head, gave it several emphatic pats to make
sure It was secure, .while the other little tot.
rather doubting the reality of the rose petals
which dotted the Queen's gown, drew them to
her little nose and gave them some very audi
ble sniffs. These little asides threatened to
demoralize the actors for a moment, but other
wise everythnig went along beautifully, and

wended their way home at the close of the
programme there was nothing but hearty,
praise Tor all concerned.

The rotunda, of course, contains more
than guns. Practically everything per
taining to the ancient and modern war
fare of all nations, civilized and savage,
has been brought together. â London
Express.
The recent theft of six cannon from
the rotunda at Woolwich has made
known the existence of that establish
ment to thousands of Londoners who
wendered why they had never heard
of the museum of artillery, that is open
to the public all the year round without
charge of admission. On boxing day
people repaired thither by. road and rail
from all parts of the metropolis to see
the gaps made by the robbers among
the outdoor guns and to inspect the ex
hibits inside.
Lieutenant Colonel Boileau, who has
charge of the institution, was proud of
one suit of armor which eclipsed in
value anything of the sort to be seen
anywhere in London. This is the
armored figure of a knight in cap-a
pie plate armor of the early sixteenth
century, engraved, russeted and partly
gilt. The suit Is attributed to the fam
ous Chevalier Bayard and is said to
have been brought from the Chateau
St. Germains.
It is valued at Â£10,000 ($50,000) by the
authorities at Woolwich, and the cus
todian of the rotunda says he believes
the French government would give a
million francs to gain possession of it.
Probably the exhibit which impresses
the public mind more than any other
is Napoleon Bonaparte's traveling oven,
in which .the meals of the great cam
paigner had been cooked on many a
battlefield before Wellington cooked
Napoleon's goose at Waterloo. There
are about 20,000 exhibits in the rotunda
catalogue; but the catalogue holds
more than the rotunda. Hundreds of
guns lie around the building in the
grounds. It was thus that the thieves
were easily able to carry off six. i
The following is a typical selection
of inscriptions on the cannon in the ro
tunda:

BERKELEY, March 13.â President
"Wheeler of the University of California
is without a private secretary now that
Nathan Moran has resigned the office
he has held since William A. McKowen
made his famous oonfessioh in Decem
ber last. Mr. Moran has gone back to
his law studies at Hastings and in the
offices of Bishop, Wheeler & Hoesler.
leaving President Wheeler to get along
as best he may with the services of
Victor Henderson, Moran's predecessor
in that office. Henderson is now acting
secretary of the Board of Regents and
will have to arrange his time so that
he may attend to the duties of that of
fice and the president's too.
Who Mr. Moran's successor will be
depends altogether upon the action of
the Board of Regents in selecting a
permanent secretary. If Henderson is
confirmed in the office then some en
tirely new man will be selected to carry
out President Wheelers directions.
Henderson, in addition to being the act
ing secretary, was appointed land agent
for the university at the last meeting
of the Regents. This may mean that
the board is getting ready to appoint
Henderson, though Henderson himself
says there is no significance attaching
to the move.
In ease one erf the other 200 appli
cants for the position is given the place
it is likely that Henderson will resume
his former office of secretary to the
president.

OAKLAND, March 13. âMrs. Lizzie
Schwitter, residing at 2208 Market

busy to-day and likewise kept her
neighbor, James Little, on the Jump
dodging dishpans, rollers, potsand ket
tles and the like that went hurtling
through the back windows of his house
like Japanese shells at Port Arthur.
Mrs. Schwitter objected. so Little
claims, because the Littles had win
dows in their kitchen that overlooked
the Schwitter back yard. Much con
troversy as to the rights of the Littles
to use those windows has been passing.
To-day the objectionable openings
became the targets for a bombardment
from the Schwitter domicile. The Lit
tle? were startled by a crash of glass
and resounding ring of tin pans on
their kitchen floor. Thereupon Mrs.
Schwitter was disclosed as the source
of the assault. Promptly did Kittle
reinforce himself with Toliceman
Thompson, who sent the woman to the
city prison, where she was charged
with malicious mischief. No sooner
was she released on bail than Mrs.
Pchwitter returned home and, says
Little, renewed the attack. Again were
the police called and again was "ma

The Peralta Heights and Boulevard
Improvement Club has opened" negotia
tions with J. If. Macdonald. purchaser
of the Fourth avenue cut-off railroad
franchise, to secure an assignment of
that right to the Oakland Transit Con
solidated, the original applicant. This
franchise was included with a franchisÂ©
on College avenue from the 'Berkeley
town line to Broadway and Fortieth
street, all of which was bought by
Macdonald for $S500 after a spirited
bidding at last Monday night'3 meeting
of the City Council.
To a committee of the club, headed
by John Yule, Macdonald has said that
his people do not desire the Fourth
avenue franchise, but were compelled
to bid that In with the College avenue
franchise because they were included in
one application. Though Macdonald has
refused 'to say whom he represents, the
broker announced his belief that the
assignment . could bo arranged
without serious difficulty. The Per
alta Heights property owners are
very anxious that there shall be no in
terference with the Transit Company's
plans to make the new connections
with its Twelfth street line. The fran
chises which the club is trying to have
assigned will connect the old Fourth
avenue line at Newton avenue with a
reconstructed road Into Nineteenth ave
nue, thence over private lands into
First avenue and East Twelfth street.
On the face of it the franchises can
have no practical railroad building
value to any company but the Transit,
for It simnly Is a new connection be
tween parts of the system.
If the assignment shall be made the
Oakland Transit Company will begin
work at once. Kails and ties are on
the ground. In this connection F. M.
Smith has widened Fourth avenue at
his own expense, deeding a twenty-foot
strip to the city and purposing to make
the thoroughfare a handsome driveway
by planting ornamental trees and
shrubbery along the street.

J. P. Hale of Hale & Company, Berke

Several important sales of property in North
Berkeley have recently been made by our

dence property in the Scenic Park Tract, the

locations afford fine views of the bay and are
eagerly sought by prospective investors. From
the present outlook this year should be the
best in the history of Berkeley.

VIEWS OF DEALERS.
. The Oakland Real Estate Associa
tion held Its first social meeting and
luncheon yesterday afternoon. About
thlrty-ftve members of the association
attended. A communication was re
ceived from the Press Club, inviting
the members of the association to be
the guests of the club at a lunch next
Saturday. The invitation was unani
mously accepted.
There is very little change in the
local real estate market, values . and
rents holding about the same . as in
February.' Dealers report many in
quiries for business and manufactur
ing sites, mostly from people- in other
parts of the State and in the East.
The bad weather of the last two weeks
has had a. slightly depressing effect on
the subÂ«Vban market, people not
caring to go out in the rain and mud
to look at residence property. This
depression, however, was expected by
the dealers and caused no uneasiness,
and real estate men are satisfied that
as the spring market opens fairly,
every dealer in Oakland, Berkeley and
Alameda will have all the business he
can handle. . â¢;.".

The "Oakland Boosters," of which
organization many of the prominent
real estate dealers are members, â¢ will
hold a meeting at the Reliance Ath^
letic Club building next Tuesday even
ing, for the purpose of arousing gen
eral interest in the movement for the
Improvement of this city. Invitations
have been extended to all the im
provement clubs in the city to attend
the gathering of the "Boosters" and
a rousing meeting is expected. The
ilrst subject taken up by the club will
be the proposed bond issue for public
Improvements.
Local real estate men have taken a
united stand in favor of the proposed
bond issue,, for they realize, probably
better than any one else, how much
benefit Oakland will derive from the
improvements named in the proposi
tion. Regarding the proposed- im
provements the following interviews
were obtained: â¢

Miss Hilton Is a Santa Cruz girl and
has been in the institute several years.
She will graduate in about two years.
She is one of the brightest students in
the institute and is 17 years old.
The debate against the Oakland High
School, in which Miss Hilton and the
others will participate, will take place
on April 16 in Oakland. The judges last
night were Warring Wilkinson, superin
tendent of the institute; Robert L. Mc-
WiHiams and Frederick Blanchard of
the University of California.
All the debaters, anxious to win a
I>lace on the institute team, were keyed
up to the highest pitch during the trial.
So even was this battle in forensics
that the judges had a hard time to de
cide uj>on the three that should com
pose the team. But one thing was cer
tain, and that was that Miss Hilton
had sustained her side of the argument
with delivery and proofs equal and per
haps better than her opponents, and so
Fhe was chosen. The other two selected
to compose the team were Weile and
Scurlock.
A blind girl wlil help defend her
school in the debating contest between
the State Institute for. the Deaf and
Dumb and the Blind and the Oakland
High School. She is Miss Maud Hilton,
and she won her place on the institute's
debating team after a hard struggle on
the rostrum last night at Willard Hall.
Miss Hilton had four young men for
competitors and a difficult and uninter
esting question for a girl to talk upon,
but she handled it with extreme skill
and came out victorious. The competi
tors were Charles .Weile, Everett Deck
hard, Charles Caceres and Walter Scur
lock. The question was the following:
"Resolved, That the United States

that the patient would recover.
McNeil had been jumping on and off
the cars as the train was running along
First street. I While thus engaged he
slipped and fell, his legs being caught
by the wheels of a car before he could
scramble out of the way. Bystanders
who saw the accident ran to help the
injured youth. He was removed quickly
to the hospital, where examination
showed that only an operation could
save the young man's life.

ALAMEDA. March IS.â After cling
ing to a runaway team .for two miles,
little 11-year-old Johnny Borman of 602
Taylor street was saved from death to
day through his own bravery in hang
ing to the lines and through the fear
lessness of William Lane Jr. of 2232 San
Antonio avenue', who stopped the fren
zied animate as they were about to
plunge from the city wharf at the
south end of Park street.
When the, team was brought to a
standstill, young Borman was found
lying in the bottom of the wagon, weak
from exartion, but with the lines firm
ly held in his hands. The _wagon be*
longed to the Jersey and Encinal
creamery and was in charge of Albert
Hitchcock of 2304 Buena Vista avenue.
Hitchcock was engaged in delivering
'milk and permitted young Borman .to
ride on the seat with him. While the
driver was serving an order .on Rail
road avenue, near Benton street, the
horses became alarmed and started on
their wild tan along the. avenue toward
Park street.
Borman fastened himself to the lines
and cleverly turned the runaways at
Park street, so that they took a south
erly direction. As they raced madly
along Park street, several other vehi
cles started in pursuit. When the team
neared Clinton avenue. Lane, whose
home is close by, ran into the street
and secured a hold on the lines. To
gether with Borman, he pulled the
horses up and Driver Hitchcock soon
appeared uponvthe scene and took
them in hand. The animals were tired
out and covered with lather from the
effects of their long run. r

An element of mystery surrounds the
suicide of Hartery, who came from
Klamath Falls, Oregon, about a year
ago. He owned a large cattle ranch
in Southern Oregon, which he sold, be
fore coming to California, for $68,000.
He purchased a fine ranch in Castro
Valley 'soon after coming to this part
of the State, at once moving there with
his family.
Mr. Hatton ssiys he can give no rea
son for Hartery's rash act, unless, per
haps, he was suffering from extreme
melancholia on account of the pro
longed illness of his wife, who has
been in the hospital for several
months. During this time Mrs. Hartery
has Improved but little and it is feared
that she may not recover. The news
of her husband's suicide has not yet
been broken to Mrs. Hartery.
Hartery left a note addressed to the
Oakland Bank of Savings, where he had
an account, requesting it to pay all
money deposited there by him to his
wife. The note is as follows:
Oaklnnd Bank of Savings: 'Please pay
whatev* money is in your possession to my
wife, Louisa Hartery. I am In eound mind
and body.
(Signed) MICHAEL HARTERY.
I , The remains were removed to the
branch morgue at Haywards by Dep
uty Coroner Grindell. An inquest will
be held at 10 a. m. next Tuesday.
Michael Hartery, a. well-to-do cattle
owner, committed suicide by talcing
strychnine at his home in Castro Val
ley, near Haywards, last night during
the absence of his daughter and her
husband. They were in San Francisco
visiting Mrs. Hartery, who has been
ill in St. Joseph's Hospital for several
months. The body was found this
morning when the family returned
from San Francisco, the discovery be
ing made by E. Hatton, son-in-law of
the deceased."

SPECIMENS IN VARIETY.
Accompanying these will be the very

A- beam. and panel ceiling: twelve feet
square, made of the finest specimens of
redwood obtainable, surmounted on
four beautiful columns, highly pol
ished, will stand at one corner
of the exhibition space. A classical
facade, twenty-six feet long, compris
ing flve arches, surmounted by an
artistic entablature and cornice and
composed of the two species of sequoiaf
will stand on the aisle lying at the
center of the space.
The other corner of the space will be
occupied by a sugar ' pine log "cut
alive," that is, with the bark left on
the edges of the planks, and reproduced
as a log by placing sticks equal to the"
thickness of the saw kerf between the
planks; with the exception that the
center plank, which is seven feet wide,
twelve inches thick and sixteen feet
long, will be displayed by sticks twelve
inches in thickness, thus completing
the circular form of the original log.
and this center plank will be placed
edgewise on top of the log so recon
structed.
As a companion to this notable ex
hibit, a' yellow pine locr (now known as
white ;pine) sixty. Inches .in diameter
and cut alive will be reproduced as a'
log.
The floor space in the forestry build
ing at St. Louis is divided Into sections,
separated from each other by aisles:
these sections are 30x103 feÂ«t. One-half
of one of these has been assigned to
California's forestry exhibit, so that
the space available for this exhibit Is
15x103 feet. The authorities have per
mitted the erection of a partition down
the center of this section. This parti
tion will be constructed of vertical
planks and will be sixteen feet high,
and will of Itself constitute a splendid
exhibit of the four leading commercial
woods of the State, namely redwood,
white pine, sugar pine and fir. The
partition will be 103 feet long by six

cial specimens that can be obtained.
It will be surmounted by a beautiful

their entirety was considered, but for
the general reasons already given
abandoned. To illustrate with the pine
family: The genus of forest trees
known botanically as "pinus" comprises
eighty classified species. These are' dis
tributed unequally. over the north tem
perate zone in both hemispheres. Of
the eighty only twenty are found in
Eurasia, an appellation given to a re
gion extending f^OO miles east arid west
and comprising the temperate latitudes
of Europe and Asia, while sixty of the
eighty are -found in North America,
extending over a region only 3000 miles
e&st and west, and -. of these sixty
twenty-five are' found on the Pacific
Slope, that is. west of the Rocky Moun
tains, and of these twenty-five twenty
are found in California.'
It will be seen that California, alone,
possesses as many . varieties of the
pinus family as all Europe and. Asia.
Of* the sequoia, which may be said
to be indigenous and peculiar to Cali
fornia, we have but two classified vari
eties â the Gigantea and the Semper
VIrens; or, in common parlance, the
"Big Trees" and the "Redwood." Every
commercial aspect of these two vari
eties of sequoia will be presented from
beautiful and striking cabinet forms,
which will 'illustrate their use In pub
lic and domestic architecture, to broad
planks, siding, rustic, shingles, burls
and curley redwood specimens.
SPLENDID EXHIBITS.
The foregoing imperfect sketch of
the exhibit is inadequate to a full
realization of Its commercial value. In
teresting detail is wanting. The ex
hibit is more complete and valuable
than can be made apparent in the
space permitted to any written descrip
tion of it, and it will be supplemented
by an article on forestry. In the book
which will pe published by.the com
missioners and In which the forests of
California will be fully treated.
The appropriation available for this
work would have been wholly inad
equate but for the public;spirited;lib
erality and enterprise - of the lumber

The enormous size of tree growth in
this State will have ample Illustration

THE OUTSIDE DISPLAY.
Just outside of the California .build
ing and in a position to be passed by
every visitor there will be placed a
white pine tree â¢ 144 feet in . length.
While this tree Is not remarkable for
its great size, it is remarkable for
maintaining Its size throughout its
length. It is 45 inches in diameter at
the cut from the stump, which is evenly
sawed, and 26 inches at the small end,
144 feet distant. It is a smooth, round
column upon which the bark has been
carefully preserved. and to the eye suf
fers no diminution of size throughout
its length. Necessarily, this tree had
to be cut into lengths which would ad
mit of its shipment, but it will" be re
stored by. closely joining these lengths
together and presenting on the. ground
this splendid column as smooth and
round as If it was the result of careful
turning. It is without limb, knot or
blemish throughout its length and will
easily constitute the most notable ex
hibit of the entire forestry section.
While 45 inches in diameter at the
stump is not remarkable to Califor
nians familiar with the growth here,
it will be v?ry unusual to the East and
Eurppe, while the symmetry and per
fection of the specimen -will have full
appreciation at ; the hands of feresters
and lumbermen.
bracing all the varieties of their spe
cies. All will be noble specimens of the
species of tree growth they are intend
ed to illustrate. They will comprise
planks 48 inches wide, 4 inches thick
and of varying lengths.
-, As a tribute to the wealth of varie
ties found in the forests of California,
there will be exhibited sixty small
doors, hung on a stand, in album form,
so that two sides may be presented by
turning, like the leaves of a book.
These panels or doors comprise- sixty
varieties of the forest specimens."'
. Then will follow approximately 270
polished specimens of cabinet woods,
the. largest, finest and altogether the
most* valuable collection of- its kind
ever before attempted. The smaller
specimens will be exhibited against the
partition, but in sueh a manner as not
to . hide or conceal the specimens of*
commercial wood of which the parti
tion will be composed.
On the redwood side of the exhibit
the broad forest planks which will en
ter into the construction of the parti
tion will be alternated by panels of
redwood shingles, sidings and rustic."
LEADING CONSIDERATIONS.
Such an exhibit would involve much
expense and labor and would require
specimens of the wood, the foliage and
fruit of forest trees; and to possess any
value the specimens must be accompa
nied by a catalogue which of itself
would expand to the dimensions of a
volume on the subject of botany.
It was early perceived that the en
tire appropriation made by the State
would scarcely be adequate for a work
of this kind, and that many years
would be necessary to its perfect ac
complishment. The hope, however, of
disclosing to the world something of
California's forest wealth was ndt
wholly abandoned, and the investiga
tion into the probability of a combined
scientific and commercial exhibit was
entered upon, but little .inquiry was
necessary to disclose the fact that the
space allotted to California at St. Louis
was inadequate to the accomplishment
of this result. That the proportion of
the general appropriation which could
be afforded to this department was
grossly inadequate led to the conclusion
reached to confine the exhibit to its
commercial aspect. The departure
which will be made from this general
conclusion will scarcely be worthy the
appellation of scientific or botanical.
A collection and classification of
nones has been made and will be ex
hibited for the pleasure and edification
of botanists, but that feature will not
rise to the dignity of a scientific ex
hibit
The dan of taking the leading com
mercial species and presenting them in 4
In collecting: an exhibit of forestry,
two general plans are open to the col
lector, one having paramount consider
ation for the scientific or botanical as
pect of the forests uf a Ftate or coun
try, and the other their commercial
significance.
The forestry exhibit which will be
xnade by the California Commissioners
to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition
at St. Louis will be distinctively, com
mercial in its motive and aspect. With
sufficient means for the accomplish
ment of that end, a scientific and com
mercial exhibit might be combined, but
euch an exhibit would require a very
large space for its proper display, and
even years for its collection. It is per
fectly safe to say that no complete
scientific exhibit of the forests of any
country has ever been made. Ger
many, where the science o-f forestry
has obtained its ripest stage, notwith
standing its appearance at all the great
worlds exposition!?, has not even at
tempted a botanical or scientific ex
pression of its forested areas.
Notwithstanding the difficulties which
can readily be anticipated, it was the
original intention to make the world's
fair at St. Louis an occasion for a com
prehensive exhibition of the forests of
California, presenting at least their
leading botanical aspect. The desire to
accomplish this result was due to the
unsurpassed forest wealth of this State,
including; the extent of the forested
areas, the climatic conditions under
which our ffrrepts had been produced,
the wide range of varying botanical
specimens, the magnitude of commer
cial lumber to be found upon any given
area, the distinction conferred by the
possession of species unknown to other
countries and the variety of the topo
graphical conditions relating to the
floor of our forests, which coupled with
the scenic grandeur of wooded slopes,
densely forested canyons and park-like
mountain plateaus, all combined to in
vest the forests of California with in
tense interest to the botanist and syl
vaculturist.

manders by about 50 per cent. Serving five years in the
grade of commander and seven years in that of captain,

will hoist their flag for only a few months.
STEALING OF BRITISH SIGNAL CODES.
For the third time in the last seven years the British
cpde of signals has been stolen. The first was in 1898.
when a sailor was apprehended and given a longr terra
in prison; two years later the offence,, was repeated, but
the offender was not discovered. The regulations regard
ing the custody of this book are stringent, but like many
other regulations are allowed to become lax. It is to be
noted that these treacherous acts, instigated by foreign
spies, occur when troubles are apprehended and cause
only a temporary inconvenience in necessitating a shift
ing about of the code signals.
Latest official data show that the Niclausse boiler ag
gregates 671,400 horsepower in nine navies. France lead
ing with 239,000: England, 113.000; United States. 103.
000; Japan, 60,000; Italy, 47,000; Russia, 42,000; Spain
and Turkey, each 23.000, and Germany only 16,400. The
NicIausseT boiler is as yet unrepresented in the navies oi
Holland/Scandinavia and Portugal.
Other leading water-tube boilers are the Belleville,
aggregating 2,000,000 horsepower, chiefly In England;
Babcock & Wilcox. 526,300; Thornycroft-Schulz, 335.600;
Yarrow, 205,700; Durr. 162,700; Normand-Signard-Laird,
168,400; D'Allert, 158,000.
The French armored cruiser Dupuy de Lome, launched
in Â«1 890. and the first war vessel fitted out with triple
screws, is undergoing modernization at Cherbourg. Nor
mand boilers have been substituted for the old cylindri
cal boiler3, and during a recent 'speed trial the vessel
reached a maximum speed of 20 knots, and for several
hours maintained 17 knots. Other changes in the hull
have effected a total lightening of 700 tons, of which 220
tons will be added to the coal supply and 100 tons will be
utilized as ballast. The Dupuy de Lome was never re
garded as a successful ship; serious mistakes were made
in her design, which affected her. draft, trim and speed,
und the introduction of ballast at this late date goes to
show that notwithstanding the costly improvement the
vessel is not an entire success.
â¢Rear. Admiral Charles O'Neil, Chief of the Naval Bu
reau of Ordnance, denies that the naval ordnance of .the
United States is inferior to that of foreign navies, but he
fails to give any figures to substantiate his assertion, and
the data contained in "Notes 'on Naval Progress, July,
1002." published by the Bureau of Naval Intelligence,
in Washington, tell a different story, which is further
supported by the German for 1903. There
is an average difference of 12*4 per cent in favor of forÂ»
eign twelve-inch suns, as compared with our guns of that
<aliber, Krupp's leading with 59,280 foot tons muzzle
energy and the British Woolwich gun with 46,765,
against our gun of 40,246 foot tons. In ten-inch guns
foreign navies have the advantage of 29.5 per cent. In
eight-inch, 21 per cent and in six-inch guns 23 per cent.
This diffe^nce. which existed before the charge was de
creased from 2800 to 2700 foot seconds, is now more
marked.
'It i3 possible that Rear Admiral O'Neil bases his good
opinion on ths guns designed by him on the supposition
that the foreign gun data promise better results than
are to be made good in practice, but trials nave proved
the accuracy of the tables, while, on the other hand, cer
tain inaccuracies in O'Xeil's claim of superiority of his
jruns have never been explained. On page 484 of the
Bureau of Ordnance* report of October 1, 1899, he states
that the newly designed twelve-inch gun of 40 caliber
will exert 58,221 foot tons muzzle energy, with an initial
velocity of 2800 foot seconds, but in the report of Octo
ber 1, 1901,. a table on pa^e 760 reduces the muzzle
energy to 46,246 foot tons. Rear Admiral O'Neil goes on
the retired list on March 15, but is to go to Europe at
once to study foreign naval ordnance. He is fortunate
in having the confidence of the Secretary of the Navy,
for it is a rare occurrence that in cases- of such momen
tous importance an official is given an opportunity of
ascertaining the causes of shortcomings without the aid
of a properly appointed board of ordnance experts.
/ . . WASTING MONEYS ON COLLIERS.
The discussion of the naval appropriation bill in the
House is particularly to be noted for its length and in
sipidity. MoÂ«t.of the argument was devoted to the
rivalry of the Lake sections in endeavoring to secure the
projected naval station. Only one battleship, two
armored cruisers, three scouts and two, colliers were
"authorized, and in the opinion of most naval officers and
experts the $5,000,000 voted for the colliers is an expense
that could have been devoted to better purposes. Only
two members, W. S. McXary of New Jersey and.E. W.
Roberts of Massachusetts, put some temporary life in the
proceedings and by the"ir clear cut arguments for build
ing some torpedo-boats and submarine boats indicated
thatrthey, at least, had some conception of what vessels
were needed for the navy. In support of the argument
for ' torpedo-boats, Mr. McNary called attention to the
undoubted efficiency of these crafts in three wars-r-the
Chile-Peruvian, the Russo-Turkish and the present
Russo-Japan war. He might have added that of the War
ob Secession, 1861-65, the Brazilian revolution and the
Japan-China war, in all of which the torpedo and tor
pedo-boats have played prominent and successful parts.
Mr. Roberts wanted some more submarine boats built,
but both proposition? were voted down without any
arguments being presented as to why such vessels were
not required.
The- relative expenditures upon the battleships Con
necticut, building at the New York navy yard, and the
Louisiana, building under contract at Newport News,
shows $493,760 on-the first named ship up to September
30, last year, and $S10,301 on the Louisiana. Since then
there has been no visible gain made by the Connecticut,
the relative state of completeness being now "about! 31
and 40 per cent.
BRITAIN'S NEWEST BATTLESHIP.
The British battleship Prince of Wales, 15.000 tons.
15,000 horsepower and IS knots speed, went out for her
gunnery trials on February 16, at the successful termi
nation of which a ship is ready for active service. The
Prince of Wales was built at Chatham dockyard, laid
down'Marchi 20, 1901, lauched March 25, 1092, and ready
for commission February 20, 1904, making her period of
construction 35 months. A sister ship, the Queen, built
at Devonport dockyard, was laid down March 12. 1901.
and both ships have been completed well within three
years. The cost of each ship, exclusive of armament and
ordnance stores, is $5,602,000 and $5,609,000, the Queen's
cost exceeding that of the Prince of Wales by only $7000.
Thirty-five lieutenants in the British navy were re
cently promoted to commanders. Of these one was
barely 30 years old, eight were under 31 and the average
was- 32 % years. Their average service as lieutenants
was ten years. The new regulations provide for a service
of five years in the commander's grade and twelve years
as caotains, thus making the average age of future rear
admirals 50 years. Of the thirty-five promoted lieuten
ants, ten had qualified for. ordnance officers, six for tor
pedo work, eight for navigation duty, one for surveying
and ten; had no specialty.
There are no lieutenant commanders in the British
navy and the promotion- to commanders Is made from
the senior list of lieutenants. It "will be many years be
fore officers in the United States navy reach the grade of
command at an age when they are expected, to have
the requisite physical and mental capacity for the re

5PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has broken the en
forced calm of his literary endeavor by publishing
in the current Critic a brief monograph entitled
"The Mission of the Republican Party." Though pub
lished hi advance, this latest written word of the Presi

the Republican Party," by Francis E. Curtis, shortly to
be published. No more dignified and wholly unprejudiced
preface for a book of this character could be written.
The keynote of t"he President's few didactic paragraphs
upon the duty of the Republican party is that little
known speech of .Abraham Lincoln, delivered after his
re-election .to the. Presidency, wherein the great Repub

In the second place, we can ouly keep
love alive by becoming more beautiful
in character. Do you not know, that
kindness is always beautiful? Unsel
fishness will transfigure even a de
formed body as thÂ«* candles bn an altar
transfigure dark and ugly catWedral
windows. If you have been kind be
fore, be doubly kind when you are old.
If you want to keep love captive, you
mu*t bind him now, not with red
checks, but with gentleness and devo
tion. This In the time to let all your
grar*t effloresce. If you are sour and
irritable, as well as wrinkled and gray,
your doom is fsealed.
Nothing can dp. so beautiful, but
nothing can be so ugly as old age! To
be adorable was so easy when your
step was ligrht and your figure was
round and vital force was issuing from
every pore. To ue adorable now de
mands toii and consecration.
Be courteous! Courtesy is (in the es
sence) appreciation, and therefore be
longs in iia brightest manifestation to
advanced years. There is no chivalry
like that cf the old gentleman! There
Is no courtesy like that of the old lady!
Upon this problem let us advance an
observation. In the first place, the
sooner we recognize the futility of our
efforts to maintain a hold on each
other by mere bodily charms the bet
ter. The delusion -that love is phys
ical dies hard. There is evidence
enough to support it. We seem to
know the soul by its material mani
festation alone. How can a beautiful
eoul be in an unbeautiful body? "When
the body is old. will not the soul be
eld also? Reasoning thus, we resort
to "hair dyes" and "plumpers" to feed
the dying fires of "passion." But it is
like feeding flames with cold water or
gnayxmists.
The great problem of married life is
old age! It is not the problem as to
whether grizzled old couples will sepa
rate or .be divorced. There comes a
time when sheer inertia will keep them
together. But the problem is, will
they continue to love?
Well, it is to be said that if she found
It hard to love this beardiess boy, ehe
would have probably found it still
harder to have loved . a parchment
faced old man.
It is a irood thing that these tremend
ous changes do not come all at once,
like lightning out of a clear sky or a
snowstorm in August. Nature is merci
less sometimes. It isn't an easy thing
to discover evidences of kindness in her
letting these shocking alterations come
at all. But if they have to come it is at
least an act of grace upon her part to
afford little premonitions now and then,
as a single leaf falling at intervals fore
tells the naked tree. They give us a
start. The heart stands still at even
these slight intimations of the ap
proaching winter of old age. But it is
at least not like having the flowers
frosted in a single night.
There is a very dramatic story of a
young woman whose lover fell into the
crevasse of a glacier and who remained
unmarried 'n the fond hope of seeing
his body when at the end of fifty years
the fluw of the ice river should bring it
to an open place in the mountains.
The day arrived, the body appeared
and the wrinkled old lady received a
fatal shock at sight of the pink-faced
boy whose countenance she imagined
would be wrinkled like her own!
And age teets institutions as well as
individuals. Take marriage. It Is hard
fur a young couple to love unbrokenly
through poverty, child- bearing and the
period of discovery, when a thousand
undreamed of faults and even "vices re
veal themselves. But the real pinch
tomes when a woman begins to have to
brush the dandruff and yick the gray
hairs off from the stooped shoulders of
an old man. In this the young hero to
vhom she gave her budding affections â
this old dotard who is losing; his mem
ory and manners? What is there to
love about him?
And it comes to the man even sooner.
What a cold chill those wrinkles and
that false front send down his back.
He married red cheeks and bright eyes
and pearly teeth and a plump figure â
not this thin, sallow, faded old woman!
As for himself, he feels as young as he
ever did. His eye is not dim and his
natural force is not abated (or so he
thinks, the dunce), and the idea that
he, who is still so young and hand
some (and who could still have any 16
year-old girl for the asking), must pass
the rest of hi? days bound by the
chains of matrimony to this venerable
female person excites a spasm of re
bellion.
Talk about the dangers tiud tempta
tions of youth! They are mere popguns
to the Mauser rifles of old age! Youth
tries the fi>sh. but old age tests the
*ou!. When a man runs up against gray
hair, wrinkles, dislflusionments, ad
vancing shadows, bursting bubbles,
open graves â he begins- to know what
Ihe r^al strain of life is.

When Age Comes.
Aside from the improvement in iron and steel tne
staples show little change ; from the preceding week.
Provisions are quiet at Chicago, with most of the stock
in the hands of the outside trade, and the packers selling
rather than buying. The hide market seems to be look
ing up, and more steadiness is shown by quotations.
Wool is steady enough, but the manufacturers are buy
ing only from hand to mouth, even though stocks are not
large. The excitement in cotton continues to subside
and the recent agitation in the coffee trade is passing
into history. In fact, all of the great staples have quieted
down considerably during the past fortnight and no
longer exhibit any se'nsational .features.
Conservatism, supplanted by a spasm of speculation
during the past month or two, is reasserting itself, and
even the Oriental war, with its underlying possibilities
of commercial disturbance in some form or other, has
ceased to be a dominant factor in any line. Even wheat,
which for years has been particularly sensitive to even a
bare prediction of European complications, does not re
spond to the daily war news, and at present is governed
almost wholly by the natural law of supply and demand
and the condition of the crops. There is plenty of this
grain on hand and in sight all over the world, and the
market is unusually qujet and featureless.
Conditions in California and its two northern sister
States remain satisfactory and about as previously
stated. The recent rain succeeded -finally in extending
to the southern counties, giving them a good wetting,
and with a few spring showers the region south of
Tehachapi will yield good crops. As for the central and
northern counties, they have been drenched. In most
of them the farmers are already crying enough and
clamoring for dry weather, even as a month ago they
wanted "rain. Our crop prospects for 1904 are now prac
tically assured, and what is especially gratifying, a great
demand for our field products seems to be opening up.
The Oriental war demands are calling on our mar
kets for large lines of barley, oats, hay and other forage,
and if they continue w*e will hardly have enough left for
our own consumption and our regular export trade. This,
of course, means' good prices for an indefinite period and
consequent good times all'over the coast. Hence the
feeling of confidence which has prevailed during the
past five years continues, undiminished and everybody
expects another good year. There is certainly nothing
in sight now to lead anybody to expect otherwise.
This spring trade is now where it should have been no
later than the first of February- The latter date is late
enough in average\ years, but when the spring revival
is deferred to the middle of March the country feels
the lull.
The improvement seems general. Collections are re
ported better, the distributive trade is expanding,, build
ing operations are being resumed and there is an air of
briskness and activity all over the country. Railway
transportation is still impeded by local bad weather at
some points, but this is a condition always expected
during the winter months, and is unavoidable in a country
so wide in area and comprehending so many different
climates as the United States. The railways have suf
fered rather more than usual from severe weather dur
ing the winter now drawing to a close, and the earnings
for February showed a loss of 7 per cent from the cor
responding month in 1903.
The bank clearings have been making an unfavorable
exhibit for some time past, and those last week lost 26.2
per cent, as compared with the same week last year,
with New York 37.3 per cent and Philadelphia 18.8 per
cent in the wrong column. But the situation in these
bank clearings shows this improvement, that most of the
other important cities showed a gain for the week,
whereas of late the whole line has been practically run
ning behind. Even Baltimore, with her disastrous fire,
exhibited a gain last week of 13.8 per cent, while Pitts
burg, the center of the iron and steel industry, gained
19-3 pe/" cent. This may be taken as an affirmation of
the more cheering reports now coming in regarding the
condition of iron and steel, the demand being better and
prices firmer, with a. very good movement in structural
material for building, bridge work, etc.
' The loss at New York may be largely ascribed to the
abnormal lassitude prevailing in Wall street, where busi
ness is duller than for many years, there being no de
mand of any consequence for any class of securities. In
fact, business in stocks and bonds declined to such a
degree during the week that the trading on Thursday
was the smallest since 1806. There were long intervals
of complete idleness, and some minutes between trans
actions. It was like the exchange of a second-rate coun
try city on a dull day. The previous record of dullness
was 86,000 shares on August 22, 1000, but the sales on
Thursday amounted to only 73.800 shares.
The fact is the liquidation in Wall street, about which
so much was said last year, has been even more severe
than heretofore thought and has driven thousands of
active patrons of the stock market out of the market,
not only for the time being but forever. A large per
centage will never again" regain their speculative feet,
and it now seems as if a new crop of public speculators
must grow before the Stock Exchange can resume its
wonted activity. So much for booms. Conditions, too,
are rather favorable than otherwise for stock specula
tion, which emphasizes the present stagnation just so
much more. Money "is plentiful, values are undeniably
low and the chances for a rise are better than for a de
cline, but the public cannot be induced to take hold of
the market. -Vburned child fears the fire.
WHILE a furious storm of wind and rain has
swept over California, prostrating telegraph
lines, washing out railroad tracks, driving vessels
a*hure, flooding lowlands in the country and impeding
transportation over country roads, the weather has dis
tinctly improved over the rest of the country during the
past week, to the marked betterment of general business.
Jts effect is seen in a decided increase in the demand for
merchandise, which shows that the delayed spring trade
is at last under way.
OPENING OF SPRING TRADE.
as great a failure. It should have a rea- ;
son. a vital reason, for upon it depends I
the self-control of the individual. May j
it not be claimed that in scr far as home j
discipline tends to thla it is good, in so â¢
far hs it falls below this it is bad? j
Taking this. then, as the starting point,
hofr many Instances of proper home
training can you number? The discip- j
line that is punitive or coercive is not j
rare, but is worthless in the higher j
ppr.se. Unless one does risrht \vithcnit ;
bâ¬lns forced into it he is saining noth- j
Ing in himself, though, perhaps, for the j
farr.Hy, as later for the world itself, a j
forced goodness may be better than j
none at all. Yet In considering the in- j
dividual himself that need not be j
counted. In many families cme finds j
only this kind o* training. It shares-,
punishments and rewards with equal j
lavishness and folly. It takes no ac- |
count of the spirit which moves one to j
the act, yet it is not the spirit of the ;
uoer which is of greatest importance. i
Many a mother shows by her course I
that she ccmsiders it worse to break j
a bit c-f bric-a-brac than to be mali- !
cious or untruthful, for she punishes ]
severely the unintentional breaking of
a dish, passes with small attention the
He or unkindness. That is, she places
things above principles, the material 1
above the spiritual, the temporal above i
the eternal. Dues this not seem to be
a mistake? Are not the thing's which
count for character greater than those I
which are superficial? Are not those |
means which lead a child to see right '
for himself rather to be chosen than
those which punish h:m for what he |
did not know? â¢ !
The occultists define sin as ignorance, I
therefore it should be the aim of those i
who govern children to help them to '
see wisely and thus avoid wrongdoing. I
How far this is from the usual course j
of discipline you may learn in an hour's j
observation of parents and children.
Following a natural and proper desire )
to increase his knowledge, a boy in
vestigates the working of a clock, to
the subsequent detriment of the article I
concerned. His motive was as correct
ag when he made the water mill for
which he was praised, but does he get j
praise for tinkering with the clock?
Probably not. More likely he is greet
'. ed with "You bad, wicked boy, tear
ing my clock to pieces. You are* the
j most destructive child I ever saw, and
I shall let your father settle with you
| when he gets home."
That reproof is a model of all a good '
disciplinarian would avoid, because it
i treats what really was a commendable
i motive as a wickedness. The only evil
was the disregard of the rights of the
property of another, and that was
through ignorance which could be en
| lightened by a few just remarks.
Then to "let your father settle with
I you" is a confession of weakness on the
j mother's part. She should settle her
'Â¦ own accounts, for her own sake and
] for the child's. He should not feel
I that his mother is a moral weakling.
Â¦ Had she talked with the boy, show
| ing him that she appreciated the spirit
; that had animated him and pointing
j out to him why he should not have
' taken another's property, even for the
i sake of gaining knowledge, she wouM
have brought him to a condition of
mind much more for his welfare.
Most people punish to relieve them
selves.- They call it doing good to the
child, but it is not. If a parent or
j teacher can punish, 'only when the of
j fense is fresh his punishment is use
i less, for ft is merely a gratification of
Â¦ his own need to let wrath, escape more
or less violently. One of the finest
I disciplinarians had this rule for his
j government: Never punish until the
I offense is a day old. Then justice dealt,
j and there was no personal irritation to
! weaken the forte of the reproof.
The difficulty with home government
lies in the undisciplined nature of the
mothers. They cannot control them
selves; how then can tney s act with
justice toward their children? The
woman who snatches*a little child from
; something It is interested in, saying
fretfully, "Why in the world don't you
let things alone?" is hardly prepared to
teach that child patience and self-re
straint.
A teacher who was unusually suc
cessful in getting " hold of her pupils
was once greatly troubled by a boy
who made flippant, impudent speeches.
She waited a while to find the reason
| for these, and then she had a talk with
I him in private. She said: "Ernest, you
have a way of saying impertinent
things which is very disagreeable. I
j think,* however, you do it because you
j regard them as. witty, and feel that the
] smile that sometimes follows is of ap
j preciation." He admitted that this was
j true. "Well, you are mistaken. Your
j classmates have spoken of this habit
of yours as ignorance on your part,
I and asked me to excuse it for the pres
i ent.". This presentation of the matter
| cured him. The same method will prove
successful in many perplexing cases.
In the home the baby Is laughed at
and called cunning for doing the things
that later he is punished for doing,
which is a puzzle to him, and also
shakes his faith in his parents. A good
J gardener will not plant anything which
j he will want later to destroy. Neither
will a good disciplinarian. Prevention
j is much easier than cure In dealing
I with the faults of children. Perhaps
the greatest mistake conscientious par
ents make in dealing with children is
j in attaching too much weight to trifles.
j and in emphasizing the wrong things.
j The power of suggestion Is reason for
I passing with small notice the faults one
j wishes to have* outgrown. Cure them
by praiaing their opposites. Speak
often of the good_ that should grow.
Find that and encourage it. : Govern
through admiration of the worthy, not
by fault finding. Children will grow
J unconsciously to like the models before
them, and the personal atmosphere of
their parents will count for more than
much preaching at them. "When the
spirit is most vexed within you go Into
seclusion before you express your
opinions. It will be well for you as for
the others concerned. Teach a child
to govern himself and you are a good
disciplinarian whatever the method
you* follow. Teach him to see for him
self why one course Is wise and right
and the other course wrong. Help him
to train himself, remembering that "he
who riileth his â¢ own spirit is greater
i % Â»Â« hÂ«Â» who takcth a cltv."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 14; 1004.
Out of the maze of conflicting reports that float to us
from partisan and prejudiced sources in the Far East
there is one that seems to be so universally accepted as
to be 1 the truth. It is that the Retvizan and the other
torpedoed warships of Russia at Port Arthur arc again
intact and ready for service. What must we say now
of the effectiveness of the torpedo in modern warfare?
The Russians have lost another of their Port Arthur
torpedo-boats. The fact is worth comment because the
loss was not sustained through mistake, ignorance or in
sufficiency, but in actual, honorable combat with the
Japanese foe. It is high time that the sailors of the
Czar were up and doing even if they have to lose. The
example of their heroes at Chemulpo should spur them
as it thrilled the world.

and when the Legislature met nearly
a oonth later the city was not in a
desirable condition for legislative busi

Leland Stanford was Inaugurated Gov

the latter part of the month both
houses decided to hold the balance of
the session in San Francisco, and it
was held in the Merchants' Exchange

GRANTâ A. O. R., City. U. S. Grant
was born on a Saturday.
A few days since one of the teachers
in the Buena Vista Primary school ad
dressed her class of young boys on the
subject of heroes and explained to them
In simple language that it was the duty
of every boy to be a hero at some time
and after she had concluded said that
the following week she would ask them
if any one had done anything that en
titled him to be known as a hero.
On the day appointed she again ad
dressed her class and asked If any one
had been a hero. For a few seconds
there was no response. "What," asked
the teacher, "has no one done anything
heroic?"
One little fellow raised his hand and
when given permission to speak said*
"Teacher, I guess I did."
"What did you do?"
The little fellow straightened up and
replied: "I was on the street with a
lot of boys who were stoning a China
man and I picked up a stone to throw,
but I dropped the stone."
"That," said the' teacher, "was a kind
of heroism which shows a good traitâ
the ability to restrain the Inclination
to do a wrong. Now tell the class what
prompted you to drop the stone."
"I saw the cop coming," said he.

"In personal conversation with the
Czar one Is struck immediately with the
shrinking shyness and softly apprehen
sive, almost feminine sweetness of the
Russian Emperor." says Arnold White
in Everybody's Magazine for March.
"The contrast between the melancholy
and reflective Czar and the exuberant
ly vital Kaiser, bubbling and boiling
with unexpended life power, can be ap
preciated only by those who have con
versed with both. It must not be sup
posed that Czar Nicholas II is des
titute of strength because his habitual
outlook on life Is rather one of Oriental
resignation than of the hopefulness
that might be expected from the head
of a great Christian nation. The Czar
is remarkable for a dignity -which is
the more noticeable because he is small
In size, and his voice is gentle and
womanly. The dignity ia like the dig
nity of Queen Victoria, which impress
ed every one who entered her presence.**

"It was not that the girl's show was
poor, mind youâ far from it, for that's
why I remember the incident so well.
She was very charming.and so perfectly
natural that I was much impressed
with her possibilities and have often
spoken of the shame of the thing â to
have to close the house. After all these
years I can play from memory a song
ending with the words, 'Well, maybe
you will, but I doubt it,' which she
sang as ah incident to the play, togeth
er with the old song. 'In the Gloaming.'
I have never seen the woman the
American public calls the great Mrs.
Fiske,. and don't know whether she
ever sings, but I was one who was not
surprised when Minnie Ma^dern Fiske
came into her own. I often wonder if
the successful woman remembers the
struggling girl and the time we had the
house closed on us because no one
would come to the show."
"Have you noticed the custom thea
ters have of closing for a week or so to
clear the atmosphere, as it were, for
the coming of a big artist?" asked one
of the older of San Francisco's orches
tral violinists as the conversation
turned on the closing of the Grand in
preparation for Mrs. Fiske. "Well, I
was Just thinking that they sometimes
close for other causes. The only time,
however, that I can remember of play
ing in a theater which had to close be
cause not a living soul could be coaxed
to the showâ oh, don't you go and print
this, nowâ was when I was playing In
old Dietz's Opera-house. In Oakland,
back in the '80's. The play -was
'Caprice,' and the leading lady was a
slender young girl named Minnie Mad
dern. The play was billed for a week,
but after two nights the frost rusted
the hinges of the doors. I guess, for
they didn't open till the next show
came.
When Mrs. Fiske Was Young.
The first lesson to be learned and one which comes
with painful suddenness to the strategists of Europe is
that a sudden blow, coming without the preliminary
warning of official manifesto, may make havoc such as
no long and arduous campaign could do and is calcu
lated to produce a state of demoralization from which
the assaulted power has difficulty to raise itself. When
Japan withdrew its legation at St. Petersburg Russia was,
on paper at least, its superior in point of number of ves
sels and armament massed in Eastern waters. By the
dagger thrust at Port Arthur on the night of February
8 and the overwhelming advance in force upon Chemulpo
on the same date the Russians had two first-class battle
ships, two protected cruisers and a gunboat either sunk
or put out of use. This one stroke alone gave Japan con
trol of the seas and forced the erstwhile superior fleet
of the Czar to remain, divided in two parts, shut up
under the protection of batteries commanding land
locked harbors.
Drawing a useful lesson from this piece of strategy, a
high naval officer in the British fleet recently astounded
England by declaring that London was absolutely un
protected from a similar sudden attack which might be
made upon it by a small fleet of gunboats flying either
the French or German flag. Were the French to adopt
like tactics /with the Japanese, three light draught gun
boats or cruisers could leave Dieppe under cover of
-darkness, sail past Gravesend before midnight, shell
London and be back in the channel before dawn. That
may be true. Correct or not, the .voicing of such a
prognostication indicates the British realize .that Japan
has set a new standard for the solution of war game
problems. Crowded closely together as they are, with
their ports not twenty-four hours' sail from one another,
Great Britain, France and Germany must realize that
the innovation set them by the fleets of the Mikado could
be practiced with startling results in the waters of the
channel, the North Sea or the Baltic.
It needs no more evidence than that forthcoming from
the short month of fighting in the Orient to demonstrate,
had not the fate of the Philippines already proved it, that
the protection of dependencies at a great distance from
the sovereign country is a matter fraught with stu
pendous difficulties. Already Australia has begun to
send home demands for an independent fleet to protect
its 'shores in case of attack. Well may Great Britain be
gin to take stock of the resources she has at hand with
which to defend provinces 'on the other side of the globe.
THE lightning-like rapidity with -which the Jap
anese struck at their- burly antagonist, paralyzing
the naval arm of Russia's service and completely
clearing the Japan and China seas within the short space
of a month, has come like a bomb into the councils of
naval strategists. From the rapid events of the last
thirty days in the Far East have arisen startling
facts to make something like a revolution in the ac
cepted standards of natipnal defense. Naval authorities
both in England and on the Continent have been forced
suddenly to sit up and take notice of what the little
brown men have to teach them.
NEW WAR PROBLEMS.
A New Orleans .politician was convicted of a felony a
few days since and sentenced to a term in a penitentiary.
Is it required to draw the, necessary conclusion of logic
and locality and add that the convicted man is a Repub
lican? The conviction pf any other brand of patriot in
the Southern city would be a .novelty little less than a
sensation. .
A few days hence France will cele
brate with befitting ceremony the cen
tenary of that Code Napoleon which
In the eyes of all thoughtful people
constitutes the most enduring, as well
as the grandest, memorial r>t the flrtt
Emperor of the French. Other of hia
creations have crumbled into the dust.
But the code of laws with which he
provided France is in existence to this
day, and has, moreover, been adopted
more or less completely by many other
of the old world nations, while in this
country it Is in force, I believe, in the
State of Louisiana. Strictly speaking
the Code Napoleon was not promul
gated in its entirely completed form
until after Napoleon had been several
years on the throne. But, naturally,
the republic does not wish to promote
the cause of the Bonapartist Pretender
by extolling the founder of his dynasty
and so it takes advantage of the fact
that the most important portion of tfte
code having been promulgated on
March 21, 1304. at which time Franc*
was still a republic and Napoleon Its
"first consul." to celebrate the cen
tennial on March 21 next. In this way,
whatever honors are paid to the first
Napoleon as the creator of the code
will be accorded to him as chief mag
istrate of the first French republic, and
not as Emperor. Students of French
history will recall that he only assumed
the title of Emperor some weeks aft'ir
the promulgation of the Code Civil,
namely, in May, 1S04.
The Code Napoleon.
what Alan (the editor) gets paid for,
and, with his new responsibilities, we
cannot and will not work him out of a
Job. He is now at Atlantic City holding
a caucus (secret, you bet) on the state

simply expected to amuse the patrons

The third will make water color
sketches of Arctic sunsets for the cap
tain's collection, and between whiles
will aid the mate in designing the cor
sets he constructs from the whalebone.
When the three return the chances
are many to one that each will receive
$1 in sole pecuniary compensation for
many days of hard toil. But they all
will be wide awake."
Another of the trio is bound north to
drive the eight-ox teams used in tow
ing the whaling Â«bark through the Arc
tic canals.
A rude awakening has been the lot by
this time of at least three men who
shipped at this) port on vessels of the
whaling fleet. No sober sailor, and few
white men of any kind, could be in
duced in moments of mental clearness
to join the mixed company of a blub
ber hunter's forecastle. For this rea
son, outside of the Portuguese and Es
kimos, the crews of whalers consist
largely of preen hands. If shipping
masters told even these green hands
the unvarnished truth most . of the
whalers would be tied up for lack of
crews. Most successful shipping mas
ters could win fame in the realm of fic
tion. To the brilliance of their imag
ination and the convincing nature of
their imagery hundreds can testify.
When the fleet now out returns there
will be at least three new witnesses.
One oftthese is a blacksmith. As he left
the Storkton boat he met a shipping
master in search of men for a whaler.
The sailor-dealer engaged the husky
smith in conversation and in ten min
utes had hired him . to accompany a
whaling expedition to the Arctic. He
would receive a high salary and his
work would be to shoe the "decoy
whales" with corrugated steel plates to
enable them to make better time over
the Ice.
Their Rude Awakening.
"It is of course the merest truism," writes Roosevelt,
"to say that a party is of use only so far as it serves
the nation, and that he serves the party best who serves
the nation best. In 1856 and in i860 the party was of
use because it stood against the. extension of slavery; in
1864, because it stood against all slavery as well as
against the destruction of this Union; 'in 1868, because it
stood against those who wished to undo the results of
the war. These are now dead issues; but we can learn
how to face the live issues of the present day by studying
in good faith how men faced these dead issues of the
past. .We must act with wisdom, or else our adherence
to right will be mere sound and fury without substance;
and we must act high-mindedly, or else our wisdom will
in the long run prove to be but folly in the eyes of the.
just and far-sighted."
This calm, high-minded call of the head of his party
for probity and temperate, action on the part of all those
whose names swell the roster of Republicanism has
nothing in it of a partisan ring,, nor does it sound the
Pharisee's "I am better than thou." It could as well be
taken as the watchword of any party, for it is the arm
orial device .of an ideal Americanism.
which was his the speedy obliteration of campaign dif

Police Bo Not Believe She
Was Badly Treated at the
California General Hospital
Captain of Detectives Martin places
no credence In the tale told by Mrs.
Ray Storck of 2005 Mission street
that she was inhumanly treated
while an inmate cf the California Gen
eral Hospital at Douglass and Nine
teenth streets. In a statement made
to Deputy District Attorney Louis
Ward early yesterday morning in the
belief that she was dying, Mrs.. Storck
again recited the 'story of the cruel
treatment to which she had been sub
jected and It does not differ materially
from the account published In The
Call. Â£ :
Dr. Thomas I. Janes, who has been
the medical adviser of Mrs. Storck for
some time and upon whose advice she
was taken to the hospital, declares
emphatically that there is absolutely
no truth in her allegation that she
was bound hand and foot and placed
In the basement of the hospital. Dr.
Janes said yesterday:
I nrat met Mi^ Storck two years a*ro. when
I treated her for exopthalmlc goitre. Her
condition at that time waa serious and I held
out no hope of her recovery. She went to In
diana, but returned and again came under my
observation about the flret of this year. At
that time she was suffering greatly and I told
Mrs. Sweet, her mother, that she would not
live ten days.
Upon my advice she was removed to the
Mount Zlon Hospital, and after six weeks at
that institution showed marked Improvement.
Upon her return home she complained of her
treatment there, but I know that she received
the best of care. On, March 0. owing to. her
precarious' condition. I ordered her removal to
the California General Hospital and she was
taken there In an ambulance. If she showed
no improvement on the following morning I In
tended to perform an orieraMon as a last re
sort. Â¦ She was suffering excruciating pain
and was out of her head. That night Mlsa
Hoffman, the matron, advised me over the
phone that Mrs. Storcfc was In a dying condi
tion. She was suffering greatly and her
screams keDt the other satlents In .the ward
awake. 1 advl*ed her removal to a private
room, which I believe was done. ! Her tempera
ture on that nlgljt was 100 and her pulse 185,
which would account for a temporary mental
aberration. Orf the following morning I found
that she was so much Improved that the ope
ration was not necessary. On Thursday her
brother took her home and Thursday night they
called me. At that time they said nothing
about' cruel, treatments I know that she -was
treated nicely and kindly and there is no foun
dation for her statement. I saw her again
to-day and Mrs.. Sweet denied the stories that
havo been published^
The last meeting of the St. Patrick's
day convention prior to the celebration
was held in Knights of the Red Branch
Hall yesterday afternoon and was one
of the most enthusiastic of the year.
Chairman Casey presided and the chair
men of the various committees made
their final reports, which show that all
preparations have been made for a gala
day and the celebration promises to
eclipse all former efforts on the same
lines.
The meeting was opened with prayer
in Gaelic by P. J. Hagerty, after which
encouraging reports were received from
all the sub-Committees. A communica
tion was received from Rev. P. J. Cum
mins of St. Patrick's Church, request
ing the delegates to attend a Pontifical
high mass to be celebrated at St. Pat
rick's Church by the Archbishop on
Thursday morning at 10 o'clock. The
invitation was unanimously accepted.
GOLD AND SILVER PRIZES.
The committee on afternoon and
evening entertainment announced that
handsome and costly gold and silver
medals had been purchased and would
be presented to the winners of the va
rious contests at the Presidio grounds
in the afternoon. Practically no ad
ditions have been made to the pro
gramme of afternoon events.
It is earnestly hoped that Michael
Davitt, the Irish author and orator,
will be present at the evening exer
cises and deliver an address. Besides
the formal invitation sent him to be
present, a committee of three was ap
pointed to wait on'him personally and
urge his attendance at the meeting in
Mechanics' Pavilion. The programme
is now completed and may be briefly
summarized as folows: , MorningâPon
tifical high mass at St. Patrick's
Church; afternoonâ field sports and
Gaelic games at 'Presidio athletic
grounds; evening â exercises and dance
in Mechanics' Pavilion.
At the conclusion of the business ses

of the convention were entertained with
speeches, music and recitations. Ap
propriate remarks were made by Ed
ward I. Coffey, Daniel Fitzpatrick, Mr.

When Koosevelt was first made. & Police
Commissioner In New York he was told by a
friend that he could not enforce the law. and
that the acceptance of the position was his
ruination. Roosevelt answered, however, that
as long as he was In office the law should be
enforced. It was, but there are few like Mr.
Roosevelt.
It. Is not the policemen that are to blame, for
falling to make these arrests, for I would be
safe in saying that they are not asked to en
force the law.
In this city there is a law to the effect that

One of the prettiest of home wed
dings iook place at 8 o'clock Thursday
evening at Alta Mira ,villa, Sausalito,
the beautiful home of the bride's moth
er, Mrs. E. A. Trefethen, when Miss
Donna Bloomfleld Felter became the
wife of Lieutenant Henry Todd Powell.
The ceiling and walls of the home were
hidden from view by garlands of
greens, flowers and ferns, flags from
the U. S. S. Thetis being in the center
of the ceiling .over the flower-laden
tables in the dining-room. The Rev.
Mr. Venablesof the Church of the Ad
vent, San Francisco, performed the cer
emony. A part of the decorations of
the house were in white and green
flags, long, sprays of asparagus ferns
and snowy white blossoms. Miss Felter
wore a gown of white crepe de chine
and chiffon, a long veil and carried a
bouquet of lilies of the valley. Miss
Ethel McCormick, the maid of honor,
wore white point d'esprit over white
silk and carried a shower bouquet of
asparagus fern. Lieutenant H. Rex

The Ductless of Marlborough Is a
gocd clubwoman, belonging to five or
ganizations in L<ondon. But the Eng
lish clubs go in more for congeniality
and comfort than do most of our clubs,
partaking of all the luxuries of men's
clubrooms â not excluding, the smoking
room and cafe, where a very circum
spect butler dispenses brandy and soda,
shandygaff â whatever that may be â or
even the wholly Innocent quaff of rural
milk.
These clubhouses are said to be
wholly delightful In their domestic re
lation and dispense much hospitality to
travelers that bring their passports
with them.
The Irving Club, Mrs. C. J. Bauer
president, will hold its second March
meeting on Thursday next, when Mrs.
N. P. Cole Jr. will serve as "chairman
of the day. The absence in China of
Mrs. Seaton Tuttle is greatly felt in
the club, she having founded the or
ganization and nurtured it vigilantly
until it is now a virile factor in club
life.
So we are to hear the rapturous
Griggs once more in the* West. Not
that he himself is rapturous, but he
makes every woman who hears him yo
into extravagant rhapsodical ecstacies.
Of course you remember when he was
at Stanford, Anna B. Shaw, with, fine
d'seriniination, discovered him and.pro
claimed him to all the world as the
ideal man. Now what would you ex
pect* but that he would be deluged with
perfumed invitations to address sem
inaries, clubs, bun-worries and other
semi-intellectual assemblages, besides
.being bombarded when in" public with
eyes, goggles, and even by the dainty
lorgnette" whenever he ventured
abroad. He was written about, talked
about and saulnted at until he fledâ
| and fled to Chicago. But he apparently
i has. forgotten and is coming out hero
next season to face the admiring multi
tude and to address the clubs upon his
favorite topicsâ men, women and chil
dren â and the talks are sure to be

t-erve to develop the distinction be

mentally, morally and spiritually, men
and women of the same status are es
nentialy alike, controlled by the same
Impulses and amenable to the same
laws. And the cause of "equal rights"
will go merrily on, just as though those
Denver incidents hadn't happened.
What 3 tumult has been raised from
end to end of the country over the re
cently exposed election frauds in Colo
rado â the elysium of the suffragist â
jusrt because the political* tricks were
turned by women!
There's not a suffrage club in the
city that isn't discussing the develop
ments laid bare by the Congressional
investigation of Representative Sha
froth's election, its effect upon the con
stitutional crusade, and its Joans, of
Arc. According to the testimony taken
before the House Committee on Elec
tions, it was proved that fraud had
been committed, and that womenâ yes.
womenâ were the principal actorsâ that
thÂ»y had stuffed the ballot-box in the
v.icked old style, "repeated," and had
lollowed religiously all the rules laid
down in the Tammany commandments
for the the regulation of elections. And
the upshot of it all was the withdrawal
from the House of the Newly elected
Representative â and every suffrage
club every bun? in the United States
â including our ownâ is making it the
testable topic for vigorous sessions.
To be sure, the constitutional croak
er is abroad with his digit shaking
prophetically, and breathing in
huarse whispers. "I told you so."
Said one of the leaders of the move
ment during a discussion of the matter
a few days ago: "Why, pray, all this
tumult about the matterâ Just because
the culprits happen to be women? Here

Denver women who stuffed and were
otherwise dishonest were so construct
ed mentally and morally, and would
have done the same had they been
men." And many there were who co
incided vigorously with tho defender of

The matter of fact is that many

As president of the California His
toric Landmarks League Senator
Knowland has identified himself with
the history of the State In which the
league is vitally interested and has be
come a recognized authority upon the
subject, having visited and taken pho
tographs of nearly every historic spot
or building in California. The members
experienced surprise at the work of
restoration already accomplished at the
Mission San Antonio *de Padua, below
Kings City, Monterey County, whe:c
the walls were rebuilt during the fall
and one-third of the roof replaced, thp
rains then causing suspension of the
work until spring. The walls were
carefully protected by sheathing, the
doors of the famous old sanctuary
boarded up. in which condition they
will remain until the rains are over,
when active work will be resumed."
Senator Knowland spoke feelingly of
the Intense interest of the Indians
round about, the Mission, whose an
cestors lie buried in the shadowy
church yard, and who love it with a
love almost unknown to us of another
race.

The P. C. W. P. A.. Mrs. Laura Y.
Pinney president, will hold its first
March meeting to-day a^ Century Hall,
when the proceedings will be as fol
lows: 1:30 p. m., meeting of executive
board; 2:30 p, m., business, current lit
erary news, bits about members and
story of the South Sea Islands by Mrs.
Emily Loud. On March 26, at 3 p. m.,
Mrs. E. J. Foster will present a clever
little stunt, a burlesaue on parliament
ary usage, entitled -A Model Session,"
with club members in the ca3t. The
Schuman Club, will contribute to the
programme. Miss Hoag, the clever lit
tle monologist, will read and Mr. Hir
schel-Stein will sing. Mrs. Pinney's
regime has been an interesting session,
although a few rifts in the lute have
been heard to sound discordantly. But,
all in all, the club meetings have been
full of delight and congenialityâ as they
should be.
By the way, have you secured your
accommodations at St. Louis for the
biennial? It is said that applications
for rooms at medium. rates are coming
in daily and are being filled by the
committee on entertainment, whose
headquarters are in the Woman's Club
building.
All roads lead to the haven of rest,
for here will be rest rooms for the
weary, writing-rooms and a busy re
ception-room, where functions will be
held every afternoon in honor of the
visitors and visiting delegates. Going?
Honolulu is fast coming to the front
&s a club center. Our own Professor
Mary Roberts Smith is visiting th>?
islands, and on March 4 talked to th"
Women's Club in the Y. M. C. A.
building upon "Influences of Music
Upon the Early Life of a Child."
Somehow these childhood topics seem
especially fit and desfrable for club dis
cussions, although most of them have
had, or are having, "practical experi
ence" with rearing little ones; but we
h'ave all made, or are making, some
woeful blunders in the process, if we
are honest enough to admit it. Say
what you will, the intelligent student
of social problems â whether she's
raised a baby or not â can help us all
wonderfully, if we will only shelve our
own knowledge for a while and take
Jn a few thoughts along those ever
developing lines.
Mrs. Smith may not have reared a
kindergarten of her own, but she know*
a thing or two about normal develop
ment, wherein certain causes produce
certain effects.
The latest sensation in clubdom is
the secession of the Forum Club from
the State Federation. But this club
has been on the ragged edge of inde
cision for months, having in mind the
secession of the Sorosis Club.
The reasons offered have carried no
sorrow nor grudges against the good
old federation, only that the club has
no tales to tell of what it has done in
the way of work when the District
Federation meets in this city and neces
sarily feels a little foolish.
The Forum is essentially a social and
a mildly cultural club, and naturally
hasn't much to say when it comes to
an annual reportâ hence its defection.

From the present outlook, it would
seem that Mrs. Orr, who has led many
strong reform movements as chairman
of the department of education in the
club, and is considered one of the clev
erest speakers and parliamentarians in
the State, and a good disciplinar
ian (which, hy the way, is essential to
a successful presiding officer of a wom
an's club) has somewhat the better of
It, though Mrs. Cotton, through her
years of patient and tireless devotion
to the club, has won many warm ad
herents. t
But what do you think has happened
now? Why, the ballots have gone out
to the members with the name of one
of the directorate candidates omittedâ
by accident, of course â Mrs. Xavier
Rolker. Now, that invalidates the whole
proceeding, unless â well, unless Mrs.
Uolker chooses to withdraw â which
she probably doesn't care to do. There
fore will the work have to ho. done
over again, with the incidental club
women's swearwords, which, by the
way. is not more vicious than an oc
casional "darn." Some cynic has it
that that's all the darning club women
do â but, of course, that's only the
opinion of a misanthrope â and he
doesn't count In the world's work a
mole's worth.
Cotton are candidates, promises to wax
warm through the weeks to come

ROGERS. Ark..- March 13.â Fernando
Walters and his three children, Claude,
aged 14; Gertie. 12, and Melvin, 10, were
burned to death to-day in their home,
fourteen miles north of here, near Gar
field. A brother of Mrs. Walters, aged
35 years, wan so seriously burned that
death is hourly expected.
The fire was started by a spark from
an # open tlrpplace. The father, mother
and* four children slept downstairs. Up
stairs were four boys. Walters got
those downstairs oux. in safety and then
rushed back to warn the boys. Un
linoivn to him Gertie followed Walters
upstairs through the smoke and flames
and went to a room where she kept
her dolls. The boys attempted to des
cend the stairs, but the flames drove
ihom bark. Two jumped from the win
dowi ar.d were unhurt. The last thing
they heard was Melvtn. the youngest
boy. bepging his father to jump first.

WASHINGTON, March 13.â Admiral
Dewey, who with several members of
the general staff and Assistant Secre
tary Loomis of the State Department
are now at Havana, has telegraphed
the Navy Department the reason why
he failed to call on President Morales
of San Domingo when the party were
in San Domlngan waters several day3
ago. The failure- to visit caused con
siderable surprise at the time.
It appears that there was fighting in
progress in the vicinity on the day the
party was there and for that reason
the admiral did not deem it advisable
to make an official visit. During the
forenoon there were several casualties
in San Domingo City from the fighting
then in progress. This was caused from
shots crossing the river through which
the boats must pass and as more fight
ing was expected during the afternoon
the admiral gave up the projected visit.
The admiral, however, sent his respects
to President Morales by United States
Minister Powell.
SAN DOMINGO, March, 13.â After
severe fighting, which lasted two days,
San Pedro de Macoris has been re
captured by Government forces. Pres
ident Morales returned here last night
from San Pedro, leaving Luis Tejura
to act as Governor of the town.
The whaling schooner Monterey made her
trial trio yesterday under the most auspicious
circumstances. The new marine pas engine,
â¢which is the larsest ever built on the Pacific
Count, proved a success. It la of 120-horse
power. On the- excursion around the bay yes
terday the vÂ»Â»Fsel mede an average time of nine
miles an hour. B<-twwn sÂ»tated marks the
covered a mile in six minutes. Captain Foley.
the mancptne owner, expressed himself as
much rleap^i Tilth her i*?riormance. About
lfÂ»O people enjoyÂ«u the hospitality of Captain
Foley.
Captain Jepson reports also that on
March 12, at 6:50 p. m., he spoke the
tug Dauntless with the steamer Grace
Dollar in tow. bound from the Colum
bia River to San Pedro.
Xew Ensrines Work Well.
Captain Jepson of the City of Pu
ebla reports that on March 11, at 4:30
p. m.. he passed the ship W. H. Macy,
under four lower topsails and storm
spanker and all sails blown away. She
had a heavy list to starboard, caused
by shifting of her cargo. The Macy
sailed from Oyster Bay on March 1.
bound for this port, with a cargo of
coal.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's City of Puebla arrived yester
day morning from Sound ports. She
reports having encountered a terrific
southeast gale on March 10 which near
ly threw the steamer on her beam
ends. She was obliged to heave to, and
when the storm abated slightly she put
on steam. Again the seas rolled moun
tains high and washed her decks from
stem to stern. A great wave struck
her and stove in several of her win
dows on the port side. After a tussle
with the elements, she righted herself
and finally reached this port, after the
most tempestuous voyage she has ever
made. Her usual time is fifty hours,
but in this case she was eighty hours.
Full accounts are given of the various
railway enterprises in the different
countries and the concessions in force,
as well as the inducements to capital
in the way of Government guarantees
and subsidies and exemptions of rail
way material from customs and inter
national taxation. Commissioner Pep
per comments on the friendly attitude
towards investments, the growing sta
bility of the Governments and their
ability to carry out the guarantees. A
special chapter is devoted to markets
and trade. . Numerous instances are
given of the ability of the United States
to supply South America and Central
America with steel rails as well as
with rolling stock generally. The re
port praises the adaptability of man
ufacturers in the United States in
meeting the special needs of local con
ditions and recites the marked prefer
ence^shown for locomotives and cars
of American make.
An analysis is made of the unsatis
factory status of United States exports
to South America and the figures are
given for the belief that these can be
materially and permanently increased.
In the rivalry of Great ; Britain and
Germany, the report states Germany
has made headway. Pepper says, how
ever, that there is a. reaction from
German cheap goods and the United
States can compete -with Germany in
supplying the better grade for which
the demand now exists. -t-~.
GOVERNMENTS ARE STABLE.
In describing the prospects of Nica
ragua, Commissioner Pepper calls at
tention to the action of the Govern
ment in reviving former projects for a
railroad to the Atlantic as soon as it
was definitely settled that the canal
was to be built across Panama instead
of through Nicaragua. Engineers are
making the survey for what is known
as the Atlantic route. The Government
is negotiating with New York and
London capitalists for the establish
ment of a national bank. If this is
done railway enterprises will be aided.
Much significance is placed by Com
missioner Pepper, on the payment of
$10,000,000 which Bolivia receives from
Brazil as an indemnity for the Acre
tract and which is to be applied to
railroad construction. The report in
discussing the mineral resources of Bo
livia makes special mention of the fact
that Bolivia Is the only country on the
continent which has tin deposits. -..
In Peru significance Is given to the
railroad movement now in progress and
to the $10,000,000 investment of a United
States syndicate In the copper mines
of Cerro de Dasco and in collateral
railway enterprises. The working of
the bituminous coal deposits is pre
dicted.
The completion of the Guatemala ex
tension of the Central railroad In No
vember, 1903, has left only thirty miles
open from the capital to the northern
border and this section it is believed
will be built within the near future.
Importance is given a contract closed
in January, 1904, for completing the
northern railroad from Guatemala City
to El Rancho. This will insure a
through railroad from the Atlantic to
the Pacific and also will encourage the
building of Panama lines to the border
of Salvador.
CROSS LINES PROPOSED.
In reviewing in detail the republics
visited, Commissioner Pepper discusses
the great progress in Mexico and the
actual railway work that Is stfll going
on. Only 172 miles are lacking to reach
the border of Guatemala. Reference
also is made to the. inter-commerce line
from the Gulf of. Mexico to the Pacific
and it is stated that within two years
two through trunk line systems will
have been completed. President Diaz
is praised for the results which have
been had from his railroad policy.
Regarding the Central American re
publics the Commissioner says that
most of them have now policies for
building lines to bring their Atlantic
and Pacific forces into communica
tion and these as feeders for
the Panama route. He "states that
the demand for supplies which will re
sult from the Panama canal construc
tion will encourage railroad enterprises
throughout Central America and he
suggests the probability of further fa
cilities for meeting the needs of inter
national traffic.
PROGRKSS IX MEXICO.
The report says that the general pro
ject of an intercontinental line, which
ultimattjy will place New York and
Buenos Ayres in communication, is re
ceiving much encouragement. At the
present time about 4800 rJUles are lack
ing, and the estimated cost of construc
tion is placed at $150,000,000. This Is
based on an average of 50 cents gold
as a daily wage for labor, with an effi
ciency of Â«75 per cent as compared with
similar labor in the United States.
Commissioner Pepper cites specific
causes that have contributed to ad
vance the intercontinental project.
These include the progress at both ends,
as shown in simultaneous action by
Mexico on the north and the Argentine
republic on the south, to extend their
railway lines; the settlement of dis
puted boundaries and other questions
which heretofore have caused the coun
tries to be indifferent to railways
among themselves; the law passed T>y
the Chilean Congress for the tunnel
through the Andes, which will enable
the long-deferred through railway con
nection between Buenos Ayres and Val
paraiso to be made; legislation by sev
eral of the republics with a view of of
fering great inducements for foreign
capital to engage in railway construc
tion, and the definite determination of
the Panama canal question, which is
expected to be beneficial both in .the
stability which will result from th^' in
fluence of the United States on the
isthmus and from the overflow of pri
vate capital Into railway enterprises.
WASHINGTON, March 13.â Charles
M. Pepper, appointed by President
Roosevelt as .commissioner to carry out
the recommendations of the second In
ternational American conference, held
in Mexico two years ago, with regard
to the Pan-American railway, has sub
mitted his report to the State Depart
ment, by which It will be transmitted
to Congress. The second conference
created a permanent commission, with
headquarters at Washington, of which
H. D. Davis is chairman and Andrew
Carnegie is a member. The other mem
bers are the Embassador from Mexico
and the Ministers from Peru and Guat
emala. Commissioner Pepper spent a
year in visiting various countries, and
was aided in his work by the United
States Ministers. His inquiries covered
the general subject of trade opportuni
ties that would result from railroad
building.

GEORGE BAKER DEFEATS
MURDOOIv AT TENNIS PLAY
For the sake of their peace of mind
sportsmen who expect to wager a lit
tle money on the forthcoming meeting
of Young Corbett and Jimmy Britt
should shun the training quarters of
the man against whose chances th- y
expect to bet. After seeing one man
go through his training work the spec
tator fails to see how he can lose â until
he watches the other man. The crowd
which packed the big" gymnasium at.
Croll's yesterday came away with th'3
idea that Britt could not lose. Britt
helped this feeling along by saying
that Corbett will never hit him wiih
one 'of his swings. He went further
and said Jeffries could not do some of
the damage to him which Corbett's
friends claim the Denver man will da.
Britt looked big and strong yester
day and seemed t<> enjoy his work.
He went foar rounds with Frank
Rafael, which came near being genuine
fighting. He is taking no chances with
his hands, wearing a bandage on hi*
right and a thin glove on his left In
addition to the bic boxing gloves.
He showed great quickness in landing
a straight left followed by a right hook.
His friends claim the oldtime strength
Is in the right hand and that he will
do great execution with It.
Britt says that for the first time In
his career he is fighting a man at
smaller stature thrn himself. SeiKer.
Fitzgerald, Erne and the others were
tall lightweights and men of bulk. Thi?
he considers a big factor in his favor.
Corbett went on the road yesterday
and afterward went in the ocean. H*
then posed for some time before a
rroving picture machine, doing a vari
ety of training work.
Steamship line to Be Discontinued
BOSTON. March 13.â Announcement
was made to-day of the discontinuance
of the Puritan line of steamships ply
ing between Boston and Antwerp. Tha
business between Antwerp and this
port will be continued by other steam
ers and those that have heretofore been
on the route. Â¦
"From all accounts of the Brltt-Fitz
gerald fight Fitzgerald kept Britt un
der full head of steam for the entire
twenty rounds, although handicapped
by a dislocated thumb. I have seen
Fitzgerald and Corbett mix it in earn
est while in training, and I have seen
Young Corbett show marked supremacy
over the Brooklyn boy In everything
but gameness. He could, in my opinion,
easily give Fitzgerald a quietus, in
twenty rounds."
"While I believe Jimmy Britt is going
to make Young Corbett step some be
fore the verdict is rendered," said
Johnny Corbett to-night. "I look to see
the Denverite win before the twentieth
round is reached. I base my judgment
of Corbett's ability to defeat Britt .on
Britt's past performances, which in my
opinion have been meritorious but not
brilliant. Britt demonstrated in hia
fights with Erne, O'Keefe. Fitzgerald
and Canole that he is aggressive, game
and cleverâ a goog ring general, who
knows when to punch, where to punch
and how to punch, but lacks a decisive
blow. No boxer, no matter how skillful.
can hope to defeat Young Corbett when
the distance Is twenty rounds unless he
carries a punch that will stay the
champion's rushes.
DENVER, March 13.â In his coming
battle with Young Corbett. Jimmy
Britt has but little chance of winning,
according to Johnny Corbett, who
brought out the champion and was at
his back up to the moment he knocked
out McGovern and brought the title to
Denver.

Fine Shooting at Theiu
Grounds Near Ingleside
The Independents beat the Pick
wicks six goals to one in the match for
the championship of the Association
Football League, played yesterday on
the field at Idora Park, Oakland. The
Thistles defeated the Albion Rovers
four goals to one on the same ground
in the semi-final round for the Cali
fornia Association Football Union cup.
The ball was kicked off at 1:30 p. m.
in the game between the Independent
and the Pickwick teams, the Referee
being Norman Logan and the linesmen
Shand and Christie. In the first few
minutes' of play the Pickwicks rushed
the ball down the field and Cowan put
it between the posts. Before the end
of the first period T. Fay made a goal
for the Independents, equalizing the
score.
In the second period, after the change
of ends, the Independents had much
the best of the game, keeping the ball
almost constantly in the enemy's terri
tory and scoring five; goals. The Pick
wicks did not score at all in this period,
and the match ended six goals to one
in favor of the visitors from San Fran
cisco.
. For the winners, the Fay brothers
rendered conspicuous service. The In
dependents lacked their field captain
and Center Halfback Mechels, whose
knee was hurt in last Sunday's game.
In the second half a penalty kick was
awarded to the Pickwicks; Murdock
made an excellent straight shot, but
Forbes punched the ball upward so
that It passed over the crossbar and no
score resulted. The losers* team In
cluded several new men who were ex
pected to prove a surprise to the Inde
pendents. The winners surprised the
losers in team work. The teams lined
up as follows:
Independents. Positions. Pickwicks.
Forbes Goalkeeper Tozer

Armstrong Rlchthark Tttoinas
McGran Left halfback Mlddleton
Welsh Center halfback Watson
Duncanson Right halfback Warren

E. Fay Inside left Lamb
P. Fay Center forward Cowan
T. Fay Inside right Peterson
Russell Outside right Robertson
At 3 p. m. the Thistles came out for
the cup tie, being followed almost Im
mediately by the Albion Rovers. Henry
Roberts was the referee, with J. D.
Robertson and A. TV. Wilding as lines
men. The play was keen from the start,
the Hovers hustling the champions con
siderably. T. Dlsher secured the first
goal for the. ThisMes, who soon after
ward added a second. Early In the
first period R. Disher wrenched his
knee and, though he stayed in the
game, was not able to render any ser
vice to his team, which was really one
man short in its forward line. The
Thistles playing well together, scored
a third goal from a corner kick. Then
the referee awarded a penalty kick to
the Rovers, which Tweedie cleverly
converted into a goal. Before the call
of time the Thistles scored a fourth
goal, and the game ended four to one in
their favor.
A large number of spectators
watched the match with the greatest
interest. The teams lined up in the fol
lowing positions:

T,he Union Gun Club members held
their opening shoot of the season yes
terday on the San Francisco trap
shooting grounds near Ingleside. There
were many guns In evidence and some
good scores were made. A great cijowd
was in attendance. More than 10,000
bluerocks were smashed. Last year's
average of â¢ seven shoots amounted to
only 5000. The first medal in the club
shoot was won by E. L. Gamble and
the second by W. Hanson of Pinole.
Considerable interest was manifested in
the practice shoot, some of the mem
bers slipping in blank shells to Joe
Pisani, which accounted for Jils low

An unknown man was found dead on
Corbett road, near Ingleside, yesterday.
By his side were two bottles that had
contained carbolic acid. The suicide
had evidently been dead about two
days. He was found by George P. Sand

body to Identify it. It was that of a
man about 45 years of age. In his pock

David Wells, Co\Ax>y, and Fred Ooth
ers, Clerk, Arrested for Disturb
; Ins the Peace.
David Wells and Fred Crothers were
arrested yesterday morning by Po
liceman Harry Hook and booked at the
city prison on a charge of disturbing
the peace. Wells gave his age as 2S
and his occupation as a cowboy, and
Crothers said he was 30 years of age
and a clerk by occupation.
Two ladies complained to Hook yes
terday morning while he was patroling
his. beat, on O'Farrell street, that three
men had insulted them, and about an
hour later Hook saw three men talking
to Merle Bunn, a girl 16 years of age.
She was on her way to the Alcazar
theater to attend rehearsal. When the
three men saw Hook, they ran along
O'Farrell street and disappeared In a
saloon. The girl, who was trembling
with fear, "told Hook that one of the
men had accosted her and had taken
hold of her and asked her to go with
him to a saloon. While he was talking
to her the two other men came up, and
they "were iutroduced to her as a judge
and a doctor.
. Hook ran to the saloon and found
Wells, who was identified by the girl,
and an hour later he arrested Crothers,
who was also identified .by her. The
third man could not be found.

G. Lacy Crawford's fast hound Rec
tor showed class above all the other
dogsi In the open stake at Ingelside
Coursing park yesterday and won out
about as he pleased. Some good
courses were run and while the s?hort
ends did not show often, there was a
surprise or two that made the pikers
feel jubilant. Presidio Boy, which
was looked upon to reach the deciding
course, and. in fact was figured to con-^
test for final honors with Rector, was
put out in the early morning by Prin
cess Savoy.
The talent thought so little of
Jolly's courses that they finally ran
the price up to 10 to 1 against her,
but the short end dog proved an easy
winner. In the next round, she went
the route again and sent Homer Boy
to the kennel devoid of honors. In
her next go, she went against that fast
one, Full Moon, and after an unde
cided course was beaten by a single
point, the score standing 5-4.

It became necessary for Mrs. Caro
lan to make a personal request of a
number of peisons to move from this
point, which they did, but it was an
unpleasant duty none the less. There
was also some disorderly conduct
among some young boys. While the
polo players are glad to have the public
witness their games gratuitously,
common decency demands that those
who attend . conduct themselves be
comingly. The international cham
pionship match will be played on
Tuesday.
Hobart scored twice for his side and
Duval and Lawson once each. Cap
tain Haig made four of the five goals
accredited to his side. Captain Chap
lin scored the fifth.
In order to better accommodate the
public, Francis J. Carolan, upon
whose private field at Crossways Farm
the great match was played, has erect
ed a large grandstand on the south side
of the Held opposite the clubhouse.
Notwithstanding the liberal provision
made for spectators by the owner of
the field it is unpleasant to record
that thoughtless persons take advan
tage of the general invitation which is
extended to the public to attend the
games and stood in front of the club
house, which is reserved for members
and their friends, thus obstructing the
view of the game.
Though losers on a technical decis
ion, the "Whites have evory reason to be
proud of their game, and they are by
no means convinced that the other
team is the stronger. In fact they are
eager to repeat the match and, It is
said, are willing to place heavy odds
on themselves. The sides lined up as

FOUR GOALS FOR HAIG.
Thi3 made the score five to four, in
favor of the Englishmen, but their op
ponents claimed the last goal should
not be counted,' as the bell had been
sounded before it was made, which,
they held, closed the game. Referee
R. SI. Tobin consulted the rules and
finally decided in favor of the visitors.
REFEREE DKCIDES.
At the close of the third period the
score stood at a tie of four to four.
When the final period opened, t'here
fore. the excitement was tremendous
and was shared equally by the per
formers and by the spectators. Each
player seemfd to feel an individual re
sponsibility for the final result, and
each strove his utmost to get the ball
between the goal posts. Finally an
opportunity was presented to the Na
poleon of polo. Captain Neil Haig, and
he sent the ball hurtling across half
the field straight to the goal. A tre
mendous cheer went up from the spec
tators when the little sphere was seen
to pass between the posts.
The polo match at Burlingame yes
terday afternoon was played for the
glory of the two great Anglo-Saxon
nations and for four artistic silver cups,
offered by the generous Briton, F. J.
Mackey. It is perhaps no more than
poetic justice that the prizes should
have bfi<Â»n awarded to his own country
men, which was tinally done on a score
of live goals to four in their favor. It
was the most strenuous game played
this season and was witnesod by more
than a thousand people. Every player
was on his irR-ttle and put forth his
best efforts for victory.
Lovers of long-distance races will

national Game on Tuesday
Silver Heels, the fast Sacramento
greyhound, was right In her element
yesterday at Union Coursing Park.
She displayed a world of speed through
out the day, her only hard course be
ing with* her town dog, Sacramento
Boy, In the fourth round, when the pair
ran an undecided course. When the
trial was run off Silver Hee!s had
everything her own way and won with
out an effort.
She ruled a 1 to 4 favorite over Jlaby
Aurora in the* deciding course. Th3
letter never had a look-in, for Silver
Heels killed the hare after a' run â¢ of
sixteen seconds and shut her opponent
out without a point, much to the sur
prise of the spectators.
Raby Aurora was among the go&d
things at the park yesierday. None
of the wise ones conceded her a chance
to go as far as the third round, -yet
she showed remarkable speed and en
durance in every course, beating Black
Coon in the third round when the rul
ing price was 4 to 1 against her
chances..
The dogs as a rule ran true to form
yesterday and the shortenders did .not
land as often as they are wont to. The
only important upsets outside of the
defeat of Black Coon were the victories
of Apple Blossom over McVey in the
second round and that of Real Article
over Lord Brazen in the third round,
the odds in each instance being 2 to 1.
In the first round eight 2 to 1 short
enders came in winners.

the best entertainments that has yet
been presented there was given under
the direction of, Mrs. Nellie Holbrook-

with a violin solo by Miss Isabel Seal,
who responded to the applause which
greeted her efforts.. Solos by Miss Zeta
Fahey, contralto; Miss Belle Thorne,
soprano, and Richard Hunt, tenor, were
all enthusiastically received. Miss
Thorne especially aroused great enthu
siasm when she anpeared with the
American flag drapea around her. and
sang "The Star Spangled Banner." Miss
Elsa Tolon made a hit with her danc

took particularly well with the old men.

The Rev. Mr. Rader then referred to
the Salvation Army, expressing a hope
that it would never be turned from
the streets, for its members have raised
their voices for fallen humanity. He
said there was no anarchy there, only
sweet words for humanity's uplifting.
No young man or young woman of the com
munity should .hear the doctrines of these
"curbstone ' orators." ; ,, .'
They are amonc thrÂ«e that should.be re
turned to the Old World anarchy; they are a
subtle enemy, and not until Â» a ' President Is
assassinated are we Aroused to their presence,
and then we admit having known or tbeae
enemies in our midst. .
When he assails the flag that , protects him
he Is not worthy I the protection of that flag.
We have had three President* assassinated
and two of them were assas*fnated -by the
license not only of a certain prws but of rabid
speakers. Speech can be as powder â It can be
explosive â and In this connection I may remind
you that anarchists have arisen here until to
day San Francisco la full of them. -
Anarchy Is spoken of in 'other names, in a
sugary disguise, and it is subtle. There are
many men tn San Francisco that ! do not like
our Government, that do not like our flag and
that do not like the success of the people of
the United States â men. too, that fling mud
at the fair name. of Christ. Â¦ , â¢-
NOT WORTHY PROTECTION*.
Thought Is private property that all should
respect. My friends, never let any one think
for you One thins always hold on to, that ts
your own private convictions, and the- man
that sacrifices them has no self-respect. Be
proud of your thoughts and die before surren-1
derlnr them. Swap them for better thought;
if you will, but do not surrender.
If a man makes a hoe he has a right to uÂ»
It. at least he did have before the labor uni<n
or-anlxatlon movement, and if a man has*
thought he ha* a right to use it. If he pp
ducea an idea surely he has a right to exprns
It, to utter It in public speech, put it no
music or In words give to It the exprÂ»Â»Â«Ion
of his Innermost heart and soul, and I trust
that there will never be anything to eliminate
Individuality and Individual liberty.
But there is danger In the liberty of speech.
It la a serious matter that the United States
gives so many liberties and yet those liberties
are rlÂ«ht when they are respected.. '
There should be free speech for everybody,
provided that everybody keep within calm and
cober limits. In this present question of re
stricting speaking; on the streets Of San Fran
cisco. I say here that any man that assails
our Government* slanders our Government and
Insults our flag ought to be bottled up and
sent to the Old World 'Where he cams from.
DEFINES MAN'S RIGHTS.
"Free Speech, Its Meaning, Function
and Dangers," was the subject of a ser
mon by the Rev. William Rader at the
Third Congregational Church, Fifteenth
and Mission streets, last night. As is
usual, there was an extremely large
assemblage of worshipers in tb^
church, and the utmost interest waa
shown in the reverend speaker's utter
ances. The Rev. Mr. Rader said ii
part:
Free gp*ech Is The manifestation of pereonfl
liberty and right to speak. The ballot Is a
privilege and speech Is a right, but remembir
that no man has a right to Â»pÂ«ak unless wlh
authorityâ by that, 1 mean that a fool has w
rl^ht to speak, nor has the man that las
nothlnc to say. In the samÂ« way a man. his
a risht to do as he pleases when he pleaies
ti> do what Is right.
There iÂ» a difference between a privilege
and a richt. as Is evidenced In the fact that
every man has not a risht to vote. And let
me say that the man that ought to vote
should have the full capacity for the privilege
given him. Â¦ . , ,.'.'.
The wagon was driven by James Ma
loney and was stopped on Market
street, near Fourth, by Creely, who
called Policeman Tom. Murphy* and all
went to the Southern police station.
Dr. Dillon was called and pronounced
the meat unfit for food, and Maloney
was locked up on a charge of having
diseased meat In his possession. The
meat was held as evidence and stored
away at the Hall of Justice.
Aftergut says that the beef was pro
nounced ' sound by Meat Inspector
Brown just before it left his place, and
that Creely's interference was caused
by a desire to secure revenge for cer
tain testimony given at a recent trial
In which both were Interested. . â¢
A wagon containing two and a half
carcasses of beef /was stopped on its
way to Chinatown yesterday afternoon
and the driver taken into custody by
the police. It is alleged that the meat is
diseased and unfit for use. Dr. E. J.
Creely, a veterinary surgeon at 510
Golden Gate avenue, caused the arrest,
and Health Inspector Dillon after an
inspection said that the action, was
justified. â¢>;:#Â¦â¢
The meat came from the premises of
Samuel Aftergut, a wholesale butcher
at 4301 Mission street, and was con
signed to 101% Fish alley. Aftergut in
his defense claims that the meat is all
right andrthat the holding up tof the
wagon and the arrest of the driver are
matters of spite work on the part of

"In the coming Presidential election,"
said the speaker, "if men exercise these
principles as Christian citizens the re
sult then can safely be left to -the
God who gives victory to the right."
With regard to political affiliation,
Commander Moore said every man
should make up his mind as to his own
belief and then he should study the
opinions of others, I and [ when firmly
convinced of the principles , which will
most largely conserve the interest ,of
his town, State or nation, should ally
himself with that party which mo3t
nearly embodies those principles.
It was far more important that- a
man should have/ well defined prin
ciples rather than he. should, be .'an
adherent to any particular party.
Commander Moore at the outset ex
plained his reason for taking such a
subject, saying that nothing was more
appropriate than that Christian prin
ciples should be applied to our political
as well as personal life. When Con
gress declared that all men were born
free and equal it did not mean' that
all men were equal in property rights
or ability to attain wealth and . high
position, but that men were born to
"the right to life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness." Â£
Every man, he said, "had the right to
live and attain a position in life ac
cording to the ability God' had given
him.

OF MAN'S RIGHT TO LIBERTY
The attendance at the Kopta novelty
concerts nx>tably Increased with the
house of yesterday afternoon at Lyric
Hall, when the piano quartet of Rich
ard Strauss was given for the first
time. The chief Interest of the after
noon centered In the Strauss number,
that was excellently handled by Mr.
Kopta and his associates. Like much
other of Strauss, the quartet is dar
ingly ugly in places. It has the char
acteristics of the middle period of its
author's development with some of the
earlier, almost Mendelssohnian sweet
ness, particularly . In the . slow move
ment. There is also the psychological
quality familiar in his later work ac
tively prophesied, and here 3 as there
the composer becomes what can only
be called ugly. Interesting, profound
ly, all through, the quartet Is, in spite
of this, and the handling of Its nota
ble rythmical and other, difficulties
was most creditable to the players.
The American string quartet of Dvo
rak was also very â¢ pleasingly given,
with two smaller string numbers, and
Mr. Kopta was heard in a brilliant
rendering of the Ries "Perpetuum Mo-,
bile." " .*/ ;Â¦-?Â¦'â¢.
Complications arise from the com
mencement of the play. Gus Shultus,
an old settler, which part is ably taken
by William F. Kohman, attempts to
ruin Ryan by breaking a dam and pre
venting a stream' of water from supply-
Ing the latter's mill. Ryan forestalls
this by putting in a steam plant, but
enmity continue*? until the last act.
There are several love affairs, all end
ing happily, and money affairs that
carry the piece to a finish. The cast is
particularly strong. The ten persons
that compose it are thorough in their
work, even the baby that smiles and
b'links and waves its tiny hands at the
audience. Harold La Costa, as "Sam
Wilber," is an artist, and Virginia
Cranna. as "Gill Cooper," is graceful
and winning. C. O. Wallace, as "Abe
Shultus," and* Olga By wen, as "Mar
garet Ryan," are good. Bertram Yost,
Willam D. Reed and Ethel Carpenter
complete the capable cast'.
"The Old Mill Stream," which opened
at the California Theater last night, la
one of Daniel. Sully's opportunities. A
perfect arrangement of comedy and
drama affords chances for the well
known actor to display his versatility
and he loses none of them. The audi
ence was appreciative and gave ap
plause without stint^ The production
is one of the best seen here for a long
time and deserves a good attendance.
The play is in three acts and from
the pen of Fitzgerald Murphy. The
scene is laid in the heart of the Cats
kill Mountains and Sully assumes the
role of Robert Ryan, called "Uncle
Bob," a rural groceryman and post
master. There are no stirring situa
tions in the plot, but it savors of easy,
everyday life and contains no im
probabilities. Sully, through the actw,
maintaining a character distintively his
own. He works from life and overdoes
nothing. He passes from the senti
mental to the ljumorous in a flash and
with a grace that has won for him his
fame.
"I heard the reports with much sur
prise. So far as I know Warden Tomp
kins is not short in his accounts and I
have never thought and do not now
suspect that he was or is. I have no
report from any expert at all on the
condition of the prison and know noth
ing about the contents of any report
that has been made. The deficit in the
funds of the prison comes simply from
the fact that the board of directors,
owing to the threatened drought be
fore the recent storms, was unable to
sell the stock of grain bags that was
manufactured during the last fiscal
year. The late rains, however, and the
improved crop prospects and the condi
tion of the grain bag market will en
able the prison directors to dispose of
their stock of bags and the money they
receive from this sale will, we, hope,
do away with the threatened deficit.
And that, so far as I know, is all there
is about it."
I Prison Director Charles N. Felton,
Warden Tpmpkins of San Quentin and
Governor Pardee emphatically deny the
report that as a result of an Investiga
tion by the firm of expert accountants,
Knight & McLaren of this city, into the
books of San Quentin prison, serious
discrepancies were discovered.
That such an investigation was mads
is admitted, but Warden Tompkins de
clares that the report was not present
ed at the last executive session of the
board of prison directors. He says that
there is absolutely nothing wrong with
his accounts or with those of the other
prison officials.
-Prison Director Felton declared that
so far as the Warden's accounts were
concerned they were found to check to
a cent. He admitted, however, that
there were, some small discrepancies in
the accounts of the turnkeys, some of
which dated from the last administra
tion and others that occurred since the
change in wardenshlp. .These, he said,
related wholly to money received by
the turnkeys from prisoners upon their
Incarceration. "The amounts acknowl
edged to have been received by the
turnkeys are greater by a small amount
than the actual cash showing.
The. investigation was made, it is
claimed, not for the purpose of Im
peaching Warden Tompkins, although
his accounts were examined thoroughly
at the same time, but largely to ascer
tain the truth or falsity of many
charges made by convicts that the
prison officials were converting to their
own benefit sums of money taken when
the prisoners entered San Quentin.
Governor Pardee was Interviewed at
Sacramento last night concerning the
financial affairs of San Quentin prison.
The Governor said:
Finally Detective Ross Whittaker
and a patrolman arrived, just as Brad
burn, leaning through the cashier's
window, was heaping abuse on Assist
ant Cashier Bettman. Slipping quietly
up to Bradbufn, Whittaker placed a
"twister" on his right wrist and before
the mining man had fully realized that
he was under arrest his gun had been
transferred to the officer's pocket. A'
second later another' handcuff was cir
cled about Bradburn's other wrist and
the man from Utah, who, but a few
minutes before, was prepared to con
vert the hotel lobby into a morgue, be
gan to look as docile as a pet fawn. He
began to make all kinds of excuses for
his conduct and even Insinuated that
the hotel watchman had placed the pis
tol in his pocket as a joke, but the offi
cers turned a deaf ear to his protests
and apologies and placing Bradburn in,
a patrol wagon whisked him off to the
Hall of Justice, where the two charges
mentioned were placed opposite his
name on the prison register. Mrs.
Bradburn later settled her husband's
bill at the hotel and departed with her
baggage.
Immediately he began looking for
trouble and when the watchman asked
him to be quiet he drew a big revolver
from his coat and, swinging it around
under the nose of the watchman, loud
ly informed that peacefully inclined in -
dividual that he would blow his head
off if he attempted to interfere. He
made a similar threat to rf colored por
ter and then, apparently realizing that
he was having things all his own way,
he strutted about, uttering all kinds of
threats. Meanwhile, however, a tele
phone message had been 'sent to police
headquarters, but it was nearly half
an hour before assistance came and
during that time Bradburn and his gun
were keeping everything at bay.
Henry Bradburn, a well-known min
ing man of Utah,' whose rough and
ready appearance plainly suggests his
calling, loaded himself with liquor and
a big-sized firearm yesterday after
noon and then proceeded to break in
on the usual tranquillity of the Palace
Hotel. As a result he went to Jail,
where he was charged with carrying
a dangerous weapon and disturbing
the peace of the lodgers and employes
of the big hostelry. Bradburn and his
wife and John Harnan. ... another
wealthy mining || man of Colorado
Springs, arrived at the Palace Satur
day. Yesterday forenoon the two
miners took aboard a large quantity of
liquor at the neighboring saloons and
then adjourned to Bradburn's apart
ments at the Palace, where a sump
tuous lunch was ordered. Table talk
eventually turned to the question of
their individual strength and to dem
onstrate their prowess as collar anS el
bow wrestlers they doffed their coats
and went at it, while Mrs. Bradburn
and a lady friend stood by and watched
the sport. â
As the struggle for the first fall pro
gressed, the contestants enlivened the
scene by smashing a lot of dishes and
creating enough noise to startle nearly
every guest in the hotel. It- was at
this stage of the game that Watchman
Patrick McGowan^ushered himself into
the presence of Bradburn and Harnan
and ordered them down to the office
to settle their bills, which is the meth
od of procedure In cases of ejectment
at the Palace. Harnan meekly com
plied vÂ«th the request and was paying
over his coin at the cashier's window
when Bradburn, in company with the
watchman, made his appearance in the
office.
The "something different" is to be
seen at the Orpheum this week in the
sketch introduced by Emmett Corrigan,
to wit, "Jockey Jones," by Edward J.
"White. Mr. Corrigan is no stranger to
most of us. Those that saw his creepy
Jekyll and Hyde at the Grand Opera
house some time ago are unlikely to
forget the fact. Since then the actor
has fallen a victim to the . wiles of
vaudeville. Lucky vaudeville! More of
Mr. Corrigan's kind and his kind of
sketch would persuade that variety is
various and the legitimate a snare.
"Jockey Jones" is a racing sketch, the
Jockey's part being played in a hospital
cot throughout the playlet. Jones. is a
jockey that is riding to win a bride by
losing his race. Then Jones' '"pal"
comes in to hear the jockey promise his
lady love that he will lose the race if
she will marry him. The "pal," Carroll
Stone, has put everything on the race,
knows also that Flossie is false to
Jones and so tells th'e Jockey. The
jockey then says that the race shall
be won. but not by him. We learn then
that he Is In the iiospital, minus his
knees downâ an accident of the day
before. Then lights are lowered and
there is a sort of Valkyrie rideâ the
jockey's vision on a screen behind,
Jones in a jockey cap and coat deliver
ing a sort of Ben Hur chariot recital
sitting ud In bed. We can see his horse
win, his "i>al" brings in the news, but
the jockey falls back dead. One won
ders if the cutting off of a foot would
not have served the author's purpose
sufficiently: Mr. Corrigan hardly con
vinces of the larger tragedy. Also the
donning. of the jockey garb is super
fluous and misleading. But the little
story is admirably told and admirably
acted by Mr. Corrigan and his com
pany. The illusion was strong enough
for the gallery to hiss the naughty lady
as she came to the front of the curtain,
even after the Valkyries had just been
seen galloping through the staircase
transparency that should have hidden
them.
Loney Haskell is also new this week
and seems to find his jokes amusing.
The audience occasionally agrees with
him. The Nichols sisters, if they would
sing without chewing gum at the same
time, would please better, j They are
clever coons, well voiced and with a
noble laugh between them. But modt
of their words are lost to fame and
from what are not should be worth
while. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
