Both had forgotten the quarrel, the
locked door, the fever pitch of ten min
utes earlier. All other thoughts had
been crowded out of Mariposa's mind
by the horrible discovery of Essex's
knowledge, and by the apprehensions
that -were cold In her heart. She
shrank from him more than ever, but
had no desire now to leave the room.
Instead, she persisted in her remark:
â¢ "Help me do -hat? I don't know
what you mean." M3H
"Help you in establishing your claim.
And fate has put into my hands the
very person, the one person who can do
that. You know there was a man who
was in the cabin with Moreauâ a part
ner. Did you ever hear of him?" .
She nodded, swallowing dryly. Her
eense of apprehension strengthened
with his every word.
"Well, I have that man under my
"That's not of any consequence. I
know that I am Jakf Shackjeton's eld
est living child; that my mother was
married twice; that I was born in the
desert Instead of in Eldorado County.
I know it all. And what is < here so odd
about that?" She threw, her head up
and looked with baffling coldness into
his eyes. "Why shouldn't I know my
own parentage and birthplace?"
"And â and â " he continued to speak
with eager unsteadiness â "you've done
nothing yet?"
â¢ "Done nothing yet," she repeated;
"what should I do?"
"That's all right," he 6aid hastily, evi
dently relieved; "you couldn't do any
thing alone. There must be some one
to help you."
"Help me do what?"
He etood .glaring, trying to collect his
senses and grasp in one whirling mo
ment what difference her knowledge
would make to him.
"How â how â did you know it?" he
stammered. â¢
He was watching her lik*. ' Jl tiger,
still standing with his back against the
door. Her eyes were on him, wild and
intent. Each word fell like a drop of
vitriol on her brain. She saw that he
knew everything.
"Your mother was Lucy Fraser, but
your father was- not Dan Moreau. He
was a very different man, and 5'ou were
his eldest child, his eldest and only le
gitimate child. Do you know what his
name was?"
""Yes," said Mariposa, in a low voice;
"Jake Shackleton."
It was Essex's turn to be amazed.
He stared at her, speechless, com
pletely staggered. ;'-" , â¢
"You know it?" he cried, starting
forward toward her: "you know it?"
"Yes," the answered; "I know it."
"Don't be impatient. It'B a long
story. It begins on the Nevada desert.
That's where you were born; not in the
cabin in Eldorado County, as I heard
you telling Jake Shackleton that day
at Mrs. WillersV* .
"Hear who I am?"
"Yes," he said, leaning toward her
while one hand still gripped the door
handle; "bear what your real name is,
and who you are? Hear who your
father was and where you were born?"
Her face blanched under his eyes.
The Bight pleased him. suggesting as
it did weakness and fear that" would
give him back his old ascendency. Hor
ror invaded her. He, of all people on
earth, to know! She could say nothing;
could hardly think; only seemed a
thing of ears to hear.
"Hear who my father was!" she re
peated, this time almost In a whisper.
"Yes; I can tell you all that, and
more. too. I've got a wonderfully in
teresting Etory for you. You'll not
want to go when I begin. Sit down."
"What do you know? Tell me quick-
The words passed through Mariposa
like a current of electricity. Every
xierve in her body seemed to tighten.
She looked at him, staring and repeat
ing:
"Open the door," she commanded:
"open the door and let me out. I want
to hear nothing that you ha\ r e to Bay."
"Don't you want to hear . who you
are?" he asked. *-" . :V-/
"You will have to excuse me, Mr.
Essex." she said, moving toward the
door, "but if you won't go I must."
The expected had happened. He
sprang before her and locked the door.
Leaning his back against it, he stared
at her. Both were now very pale.
"So," he said, hearing his own voice
shaken by his rapid breathing, "you're
not going. I've not said half I came to
say. I've not come to-day to plead and
sue like a beggar, for the love that
you're ready to give one day and take
back the next. I've other things to

word that would in a seemly manner
express his thought. In reality, racking
his brains- for the one that would hurt
her most â "hardly a maidenly way con
sidering your lack of interest in me?"
The word he had chosen told. Her
color sank suddenly away, leaving her
very pale. Her face seemed to stiffen
and lose ita youthful curves. Â¦
"I don't think." she Bald- slowly,
"that Jt's necessary to continue this
conversation. It doesn't seem to me to
be very profitable to anybody." ?-
She looked at him, but he made no
movement.

to look at ; a; painting of ;
on \ an easel-^addressed a t-asuulf; re

had already met the newspaper man,
and set him down, without illnsion-c-r
hesitation, ., as ; a , clever ad venturer. ; Re
overcame , his \ surprise at '). frieetlng : him
in the house of the bonanza widow, by
the reflection that this was the United
States, where all men are equal,, and
wornen'.with money, free to be i wooed
by any of them.
The ? Count was in i an uncertain and
almost uncomfortable 'state of : mind.
The letter , ! he \ had received from. Mrs.
Shackleton, ; bidding; him" to the feast,
was the second from her, since Maud's
rejection of him. The first had been of
a consolatory and encouraging; nature.
Mrs. Shackleton told him that Maud
wag young, and that many; women said
no, when they meant yes. The Count
knew both these things as well as Mrs.
Shackleton; the latter, even better. But
it seemed \to ; him /that -Maud, young
though. she was. had not meant yes, and
the , handsome- Frenchman wab not the
man to force his attentions on any
woman. He watched" her without ap
pearing to .notice her. She had been
greatly embarrassod at sight of him.
" Maud sat beside Essex, and even that
easily, fluent gentleman found her diffi
cult to interest .She appeared dull and
unresponsive. Looking at. her .with
slightly narrowed eyes, V he. wondered
how the Count, of Â» whose name arTd ex
ploits he" had often;' heard in Paris,
could contemplate 1 so brave an .'act : as
marrying 'her..- : â¢
The Count, ' who, haying] more â¢ heart,
could see deeper, aeke'd himself If : the
girl was really.unhappy. .; As he listened
to Miss Thurston's marvelous, French
he wondered, /with; a little expanding
heat of irritation,* if the mother was
trying, to . force the ; marriage . against
the daughter's wish. ; 'Â¦â¢ He ; had broken
hearts in his day, but it.wasnota pas
time he , found agreeable, j He ,- was too
gallant a gentleman to woo, where h{p
courtship was unwelcome. 'Â¦.'.
. When the gentlemen . entered the
drawing-roorn froni their after-dinner
wine and cigars, they found the ladies
seated by "one of the fires *jbel6w> the
Mexican onyx mantels. Bessie' rose as
they approached and, .turning to .Es
sex, asked him if he had seen. the Bou
guereau on -the easel, and .steered him
toward it. 'Â¦'Â¦.-Â¦'.
"It was one of Mr. Shackleton's last
purchases," she said; "he was very an
xious to have a fine collection. He had
great taste." . , ,
Her companion., looking at the plump,
pearly-sklnnned. nymph and her atten

when he had first entered California,
and said;, with 'conviction:;
"What; a versatile man

'.'Oh, : . he loved it," said Bessie, and
knew a great deal about it: We were
in Europe two years ago for six months,
and 1 , Mr. Shackleton and I visited a

bought from Rc-3a Bpnheur. She's an
interesting woman, looHeU'Just like ' a

a'Qerome. Would you like to; see. it?
It's considered a very flrieexarnple."
He expressed his , desire to see the
Gerome," and followed "Bessie's rustling
wake into the Moorish robrn./
"We hoped," {continued Bessie, sink
ing into a seat, "to have a"fine.collec
tion, and build ,a; gallery tor them | out
in the garden. There": was plenty \ of
room; arid they would. have shown off
better all together that; way, rather
than /scattered about like/ this. But*
I've no -[ ambition : to - do ; it now, and

It's much the best way." '-/
She turned and'. passed out of sight at
the top"of the* stairs. Bar'rpn stood 4 be
low under the; hail' gasi : his head
drooped. â¢ He , was \ puzzled, for, say
whatHhey might, he was certain he had
heard cries. N . ' '

"Xot^oIi, no; other things."
"What on earth are you doing there?"
ho. said; "standing behind the door

She thanked heaven for the friendly
dark and answered hurriedly:
"Iâ Iâ Iâ didn't want you to catch me.
I'm soâ so â untidy."
"Untidy? I , never saw. you untidy,
and don't believe you ever were. \ I met

"Yes; his name's' Essex, and 'hfe's a

He was here, and I thought he'd| come

it happened."
. "And he stayed an.- hour talking
about music lessons?" â¢
The hall door slammed behind Essex,
and the other man turned into the par
lor, where the light was now- very 'dim.
In his exit from; \ the room Essex had
flung the door open with violence, and
Mariposa, who had backed against the
wall, was still standing behind it. As
Barron pushed it to he saw her, a vague
black figure with- white hands and faoe,
in the dark. /\:' '^^')
The new-comer drew back from- the
departing stranger with an apologetic
start. â¢ Â¦"Â¦...- ' Â¦ - Â¦
"Beg : your pardon," he said bru'skly.
"but I thought I heard some one scream
in here." 4
"Scream?" said : Essex, languidly se
lecting his hat from the disreputable
collection on the rack; "I didn't notice
it, and I've been sitting in there for
nearly an hour with . Miss Moreau. I
fancy you've made a riiistake.".
"I guess I must havs.. It's odd." .
As the portal swung open and he
passed into the hall, the front door was
violently, pushed Inward, and "Barron
almost fell' against him in the hurry. of
his. entrance. Â¦:.' , ,,
with all her.force, a-blow on the face.
She saw the skin redden under Jt.
"Open the; door!", she gasped; "open

For the moment; the blow so stunned

Mariposa heard the click of the gate

a sudden furious pounding on the door,

her lungs: .

"That sounds a very plausible solu

a deadly enemy to common sense."
"That's"; the way 'it seemed to me.
She had fallen in love, and evidently
the man had not enough I money to

Eomething. When I thought of that I
was certain I'd found the clew. The

Essex again raised his eyebrows and
looked into the fire.

"Yes, I suppose she is. She is certainly
fnot a sophisticated or worldly person."

pain.
; "Why, you're crazy," % she" cried.
"There'll never be any of it. Never be
any claim made or contest, or anything
that you talk of. You want me to
make money out of my mother's story
that was a tragedy â that I can- hardly
think of myself! Oh"!â ".She turned
around, speechless, and put her hand
to her mouth. . . v
"When will it be?" he said, Riving it
a gentle squeeze; "when, sweetheart?"
She tore her hand away.
He had come close -to her and, stand
ing at her 6ide, bent his head in v order to
look more directly Into her face. â¢
, "This ought to puL'an end, dear, to
your objections," he said gently; "you
can't do it alone. No woman could,
much less one like youâ young,' inex
perienced, ignorant df . tne world.
You've got no idea what Â¦ a â¢ big con-'
test like this means. There [must be a
man to help you, arid I must -be that
man, Mariposa. We can. marry quietly
as soon as ; you are ready. It would be
better not to make any move until after
that, as it would be much easier for me
to conduct the campaign as your hus
band than as your fiance. , I'd take the
whole thing off your shoulders. You'd
have almost nothing to, do, except* be
certain of your memories and , dates,
and I'd see to it- that you were letter
perfect In that when the time came.
I'd stand between you and everything
that was disagreeable." Â¦ i.%k -Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
He took her hand, which for the mo
ment was passive in his. -L;..^
"Ah," he said, with almost a laugh of
relief. "That settles it. You with the
certificate and I with Harney! Why,
we've . got . them." , . -
"We?" -she said,: iqeking up as
though waking. "We?"
"Yes; we," he answered.

hand. He and Mrs. Shackleton are the
only living witnesses of the transaction
whereby your mother and you passed
invr) Moreau's keeping. And I have
him. I've got him here." He made a
gesture with his thumb as though
pressing the ball of it down on some
thing. Then he looked at Maripoea
with eyes full of an eager cupidity. Â¦ Â¦';"â¢
She did not respond with Jlieshow of
interest he had expected, \ but . stood
looking down, pale and motionless.
Her brain was in" an appalled 'chaos
from which stood out only a* few. facts'.
This terrible man knew her, secretâ the
secret of her mother's life and .honor
that she would have died to hide in the
sacredness of her love for the dead man
and woman who could no- longer;de
fend themselves. ; - â¢ ' . / *>;
"It seems as if fate had- sent me to
help you,". he went .on; "you couldn't
do it alone."
"Do what?" she asked without mov
ing. , ; : â¢
"Establish your claim as . the real
heir. Of course you're, the chief heir.
I've been looking it up. The others will
get a share as acknowledged children.
But you ought to get- the bulk .of the
fortune as the only legitimate child."
"Establish my claim?' she repeated.
"Do. you mean, prove that I'm Jake
Shackleton's daughter?"- .
"Yes. And there's a tremendously
important point. Did your mother have
papers or letters showing that Bhe had
been Shackleton's wife?'* . ;
"She left her marriage certificate,"
she said dully, hardly conscious of her
worfls. "I hav,e it."
"Here?â by you?" with quick curi
osity.
"Yes; upstairsâ in my little desk."-
"Who makes you miserable, dear
young lady?" he said, honestly. touched.
"You," she almost whispered. "You
do. You don't mean" to, I know, for I
think â¢ you're kinder " than } lots of other
men. Butâ butâ Oh. please, don't keep
on asking me to marry you.. Don't. do
it any mere ; that makes me miserable.
Because I ".can't - do , it. Truly, , I can^t."
. - Count de Lamolle became" very grave.
He drew himself^ up with an odd, stiff
air, like a soldier.
"If a lady speaks this way. to a man."
"If I thought you really cared it
would be different. Perhaps I couldn't
say it. I hate making people miserable,
and yet so many people make me mis
erable.". .. . I -
"That is a strange remark," he said,
completely taken by surprise, and won
dering what thisextraordinary girl was
going to say next.
"Dear Miss," said the Frenchman,
really concerned by her ? tragic . de
meanor, "say whatever, pleases you. I
am .only here to listen."
"You don't really care for me. Oh,
if you'd only tell the truth!" .
"I've got to say something to you. It
may sound queer, but I've got to say
it."
"I : have always , heard* â¢ that Mrs.
Shackleton was generous," said Essex,
locking at her with a slight smile.
"Oh, generous!" she said, with a little
movement of impatience, which, was
genuine. 'This is no question of gen
erosity;" I want the girl to go and be a
singer, and I don't want her to go
alone. Now, I've found out a way for
her to go that will be agreeable to her
and to me, and I" take for granted, to
the man."
She looked at Essex with a smile that
almost said she knew him to be the
favored person.
"Of course," she continued, "it would
be better for him to get some work. It's
bad for a" man or woman to be idle. If
he knows how. to write, it would be an
easy matter to make him Paris corre
spondent of The "Trumpet. It was my
husband's intention to have a corre
spondent, and he had some idea of of
fering it to Mrs.' Will ers. But it's not
the work for her, nor she the woman
for it. It ought to be a man. and a man
that's conversant with the country and
the language. There'll be a good sal
ary to co with it. Win was talking
about.it only the other evening."
; "What a showering of good fortune
on one person," said Essex â "a position
ready-made, a small fortune and a
beautiful wife! He must be a favorite
of the gods."
"You can call it what you like, Mr.
Essex," said Bessie. "It's been my ex
perience that the gods take "for their
favorites men and women who've got
some hustle. Everybody has a chance
some time' or other. Miss Moreau and
her young man. h'ave theirs now." Â¦
She rosejto her feet, for at that mo
ment, Pussy 'Thurston appeared in the
doorway to say good-night.
The pretty " creature had cast more
than one covertly admiring look at Es
sex, during the dinner, and now, as
she held out her hand to. him in fare
well, she said after the informal West
ern fashion:
"Won't you come to see me. Mr. Es
sex? I'm always at home on Sunday
afternoon. If you're bashful Win will
bring you. He comes "sometimes when
he's got nowhere else in the world to
s Â° to -" 3p8b
Win who was Just behind her, ex
pressed his willingness to act as escort,
and laughing and jesting, .the party
passed through- the doorway into the
drawingrroom. The little fires were
burning low. By the light of one, Maud
and Count de Lamolle were looking at
a book of photographs of Swiss views.
The Count's expression was enigmatic,
and as Bessie approached "them she
heard Maud say:
"Oh, that's a mountain. What's the
name of. it. /now? I can't remember.
It's very high. and pointed, and people
are always climbing it and falling into
holes."
"The Matterborn, perhaps," sug
gested the' Count, politely. .
. To which Maud- gave. a. relieved as
sent. Her words were commonplace
enough, but there wa3 a quality . of
Hght-heartedness,' of suppressed ela
tion, 'in her voice, that her mother's
quick ear instantly caught. As the girl
looked up at their approaching figures
her face showed the same newly ac
quired sparkle that was almost joyous.
It had, in fact, beena critical evening
for Maud, ;, and so miserable did she
feel her -situation to be that she had
taken her courage* in both hands and
struck one desperate blow for freedom.
When her mother and Essex had be
gun their pictorial migrations she had
felt the cold- dread of a tete-a-tete
with the Count creeping over her heart.
For a space she had tried to remain at
tached to Win and Pussy Thurston, but
neither Win nor Pussy, who were old
friends and had many subjects of mu
tual interest to discuss, encouraged her
society. Maud was not the person to
develop diplomatic genius under . the
most favorable circumstances. Half an
hour after the men had entered the
drawing-room, she found herself alone
with the Count in front of the fire. Win
and Pussy haying strayed away to the
Bouguereau. '."
The Count had tried various subjects
of conversation, but they had drooped
and died after a few minutes . of lan
guishing existence. He stood with his
back to the mantelpiece, looking curi
ously at Maud, who sat on the edge of
an armchair just within reach of the
fluctuating light. Her .hands were
clasped on her knee, and she was look
ing down so that he could not see her
face. â¢ ...
Suddenly she rose to her feet and
faced him. She was pale and her eyes
looked miserable and terrified., .,
"Count de Lamolle," she breathed in
a tremulous voice.
"Mademoiselle," he said, moving to
ward her, very much surprised by her
appearance. .'.

to himself. â¢It'was ah admirable testi

came in I thought I heard shouts com
ing from somewhere."
"That wasn't us," said Miguel from
his larger bed in the corner. "We was
playing burying soldiers In the back
yard, and that's a game where you
bury soldiers, cut out of the papers, in
the sandy place. There's no sorter
hollering in it Sometimes we play
we're crying, but that's quiet."
"P'raps,"- said Benito sleepily, "it was
Miss Moreau's gentleman in the par
lor. I let him in. They might have
been singing. Now tell us the story
about the Indians and the pony ex
press."
This was all the satisfaction he got
from the boys. After the Btory was
told he did not go downstairs, but went
into his own room and sat by his lit
tered table, thinking. The details of his
entrance Into the house a few hours be
fore were engraved on his mind's eye.
By the uncertain gaslight he saw the
dark face of the stranger, with its
slightly Insolent droop of eyelid and
non-committal line of clean-shaven lip.
It was to his idea a disagreeable face.
The simple man in him read through
its shield of reserve to the complexi
ties' beneath. The healthy frank Amer
ican saw in it the intricate, sophistica
tion of older civilizations, of vast com
munities where "God hath .nmde man
upright; but they have- Bought out"
many inventions."
On his ear again fell the cold pollts
ness of the voice. Gamaliel Barron was
too lacking in any form of self-con
sciousness, was too indifferently con
fident of himself as a Westerner, the
equal of any and all human creatures,
to experience that sensation of mau
vaise honte that men of smaller fiber
are apt to feel in the presence of beings
of superior polish. Polish was nothing
to him. The man everything. And It
seemed to him he had seen the man,
deep down. In that one startled mo
ment of encounter in the hall. Thought
fully smoking and tilting back in his
chair, he mentally summed him up In
two. words, "bad egg." He would keep
his eye on him, and to do bo would put
off the trip to the mines he was to take
In the course of the next two weeks.
The next morning Mariposa's appear
ance at the breakfast table roused the
uneasiness he felt to poignant mxlety.
.With the keenness of growing love, he
realized that It was the mind that was
disturbed more than the body. He came
home to lunch â an unusual deviation,
as. he almost Invariably lunched down
towji at the Lick House â and found her
at the table as pale and distrait as ever.
After the meal was over he followed
her into- the halL She was slowly as
cending the stains, one hand on the bal
ustrade, her long, black dress Eliding
upward from Btair to stair. '*
He. followed her noiselessly, and at
the top of the- flight, turning to go to
her room,^he saw him and. paused,- her.
The morning after her-interview with
Essex Mariposa had appeared at
breakfast white-cheeked and apathetic
She had eaten nothing, and when ques
tioned as to her state of health had re
plied that she had passed a sleepless
nipht and had a headache.
Barron, sitting opposite, had been
watching her covertly through the
meal. He saw that she ate nothing,
and guessed that the headache she
pleaded was the result of a wakeful
night. The evening before, when he
had gone in to see the little boys in
â¢ bed. he had casually asked them if they
had been playing games that afternoon
in which shouting bad been a promi
nent feature.
"Indians?** Benito had suggested, sit
ting up in his cot and scratching the
back of his neck; "that's a hollering
game."
CHAPTER XX
At five o'clock, shelterc " by the drip
ping dark, Essex began - his furtive
watch of, the streets along which . she
might pass, j He knew that every -day
was precious to him now, with Mrs.
Willers among his enemies and' ready
to enlist WInslow Shackleton against
him. Here was an opportunity to see
the girl, better than, the parlor of the
Garcia house offered, with its officious
boarders. There was absolute ' seclu
sion in these back" and rain-swept
streets.
He had been- prowling about for ai
hour when he finally saw her. A dozen
times he had cursed under * his breath
fearing she had. escaped him ; now his
relief was such that he ran toward her,
and with a rough hand swept aside her
umbrella. In the clear light of the un
curtained pane she saw his face, and
shrank back against the wallas If she
had been; struck. Then , a second im
pulse, seized her and she tried to dash
past him. He seemed prepared for this
and caught her by the arm through her
cloak, , swinging her violently back . to
her place against the wall.' Â¦ - . *
Keeping his grip on her he said, try
ing to smile: ;
< "What are you afraid of ? Don't you
know me?"-'
"Let: me go," she said, struggling,
"you're hurting mÂ«."
l[ "I f don't want to hurt you," he an
swered, "but I mean to keep you for a
moment. I want to talk to you; And
I'm going to talk to you."
"I won't' listen to. you.: Let me go at
once. How cowardly to hold me in this
way against my will!"'.
â¢ She tried again to wrench her, arm
out of .his grasp, :but he held tier, like a
vise. Her resistance of him arid the re
pugnance "in her e face ; and voice mad- .
dened him.- He felt for, a moment, that
he would'like to batter her against the
wall.:
"There's no use trying to get away,
and telling me how much ; you hate me.
I've '."grot i you here at last. I'll not let
you go till I've had my say." ,
He put his 1 face down ; under the tent
of her umbrella* arid gazed at her with
menacing eye? / and tight lips. \ In^the
light Vof ' the\I window,, and I against Cthe
inky^ blackness , around them the^two*
faces .were' distinct : as cameos â¢ hung on
a I velvet 'i background. ; ? tV He ; saw. the
whiteness ; of ' her" chin ~on , the * bow be
neath it, 'and 'her mouth,'' with '.the lips
that all ' the anger j in t the world could
Pressing a", quarter into . .-: Benito's
readiiy extended palm, he had inquired
if the boy knew where Miss Moreau
was. .
"Mariposa?" said Benito, .with easy
familiarity; "she's at Mrs. Willers' giv
ing Edna her lesson. This is Wednes
day, ain't it? Well, Edna gets her les
son on . Wednesdays from half-past
four till half-past five, and -'so that's
where Mariposa is. But she's' gener
ally late 'cause she stays and talks to
Mrs. Willers." . : 'Â¦
It, was the afternoon of Edna "Willers'
music lesson. Over a week had elapsed
since Mariposa's _ interview with Essex,
yet to-day, as she stood at her window
looking out at the threatening sky, her
fear's of 'him were as active as ever.
Though he had made no further sign,
her woman's Intuitions warned her that
this was but a temporary lull in his
campaign. She .went out with the fear
of meeting him driving her into unfre
quented streets.
The music lesson had hardly begun
when the rain was lashing the window
and pouring down the panes in fury.,
Darkness fell â¢ with it. The night
seemed to drop on the city in an in
stant,'coming with a whirling rush of
wind and falling waters. The house
wifely -little Edna drew the curtains
and lit the gas, saying as she settled
back on her music-stool:'
"You'd better stay to dinner with me,
Mariposa. Mommer won't be home till
late - because it's Wednesday, and the
back part of the woman's page goes to
press." |s|sSi
"Oh, I couldn't stay to-night," said
Mariposa hurriedly, affrighted by the
thought of the walk home alone at ten
o'clock,: which she had often, before
taken without a tremor; "I must go
quite soon." I fogot \ It was the day
when the back sheet goes to press. Go
on. Edna, it will be like the middle of
the night by the time we finish."
. This was indeed the case. When the
lesson was over, the evening outside
was shrouded in a midnight darkness
to an accompaniment of roaring rain.
It was a torrential downpour. The two
girls, peering out into the street, could
see by the blurred rays of the lamps a
swimming, highway, down which > a car
dashed at intervals, spattering the
blackness with the broken lights of its
windows. Despite the child's urgings
to remain, Mariposa insisted on going.
She was well prepared for wet she said,
folding her circular about her and re
moving the elastic band~that held to
gether her disreputable umbrella.
But she did not realize the force of
the storm, till she found herself In the
street. By keeping in the lee of the
houses on the right-hand side, she could
escape the 'full fury of the wind, and
she began slowly making her- way up
ward.
She had gone some distance when the
roll of . music she carried slipped from
under her arm and fell into water and
darkness. She groped for it, clutched
its saturated, cover, and brought it up
dripping. The music was of value to
her, and she moved forward to where
the light of an uncurtained window cut
the darkness,' revealing* the top of a
wall. Here she rested the roll and tried
to wipe.it dry with her handkerchief.
Her face, down-bent and earnest, was
distinctly visible. in the shaft of light.
A man, standing opposite, .who had
been I patrolling these streets for the
past hour, saw it, gave a smothered
exclamation, and crossed the street. He
was at her side before she saw him.
Several hours earlier Essex had been
passing down a thoroughfare, in that
neighborhood, when he had met Benito,
slowly wending his way homeward
from school. The child recognized him
and" smiled, and with the smile, Essex
recollected the face and'saw that fate
was still on his side.
CHAPTER XXI.
throwing down - her gage in defense Â¦ of
her friend. , .
hand still touching, the rail.
"Miss Moreau," he said, "you're tired
our â too tired to teach. Let me so aod
put off your pupils. I've a lot of spare
time this afternoon."
"How kind of you," she said, looking
faintly surprised: "I haven't any this
afternoon, luckily. I don't work every
day; that's the point I'm trying to work
up to; that's my highest ambition.'
She looked down at his upturne 1 face
and gave a slight smile.
"Is it overwork that kept you awake
last night and makes you look so pale
to-day?" he queried in a lowered voice.
"Oh, I don't know"â she turned away
her lace rather Impatientlyâ "I'm wor
ried, I suppose. Everybody has to be
worried, don't they?". ,
"I cfÂ»n't bear to have you worried.
There isn't one wild, crazy thing in the
world 1 wouldn't do to prevent it."
H; was looking up at her with his
soul in his, eyes. Barron was not the
man to hide or Juggle with his love. It
possessed him now and shone on his
face. Mariposa's eyes turned from it
as from the scrutiny of something aÂ£
once painful and holy. He laid his hand
on hers on the rail.
"You know that," he said, his deep
voice shaken.
Her eyes dropped to the hands and
she mechanically noticed how white her
fingers locked between his large, brown
ones. She drew them softly away, feel
. ing his glance keen, impassioned and
unwavering on her face.
"Something's troubling you," he con
tinued in the same voice. "Why won't
you let me help you? You needn't tell
me what it is. but you might let me
help you. What am I here for but to
take care of you, and fight for you, and
protect you?"
The words were indescribably sweet
to the lonely girl. All_the- previous
night she had tossed on her pillow
haunted by terror of Essex and what
he intended to do. She had felt herself
completely helpless, and her uncer
tainty at what step he meant to take
was torturing. For one ' moment of
weakness she thought of pouring it all
out to the man beside her, whose strong
hand on her own had seemed symbolic
of the grip, firm and fearless, he could
take on the situation that was threat
ening her. Then she realized the im
possibility of such a thing and drew
back from the railing.
"You can't help me," she said; "no
one can."
He mounted a step and stretched his
hand over the railing to try to detain
her.
"But I can do one thing; I can al
ways be here, here close to you, ready
to come when you call me, either in
trouble or for advice. If ever you want
help, help of any kind, I'll be here.
And if you had need of me I think I'd
know it, and no matter where I was,
I'd come. Remember that."
She had half turned away toward her
door as he spoke, and now stood in pro
file, a tall figure, with her throat and
wrists looking white as milk against
the hard black line of her dress. She
seemed a picture painted in few colors,
her hair a coppery bronze, and her lips
a clear, pale red, being the brightest
tones in the composition.
"Will you remember?" he said.
"Yes," she murmured.
"And when you want help come to
me, or call for me, and if I were at the
ends of the world I'd hear you and
come."
She turned completely away without
answering, and, opening her door, van
ished into her room.
For the next three or four days she
looked much the same.
Barron's anxiety about her, though
not again openly expressed, continued.
He was certain that some blow to her
peace of mind had been delivered by
the man he had seen in the hall. He
did not like to question her, or attempt
an intrusion into her confidence, but
he remembered the few words she had
dropped that evening. The man's
name was Essex, and he was a friend
of Mrs. Willers'. Barron had known
Mrs. Willers for years. He had been a
guest in the house during the period of
her tenancy, and thopgh he did not see
her frequently, had retained an agree
able memory of her and her daughter.
It was therefore with great relief
that, a few days after his meeting with
Essex, he encountered her In the heart
of a gray afternoon crossing Union
square Plaza.
Mrs. Willers was hastening down to
The Trumpet office after a morning's
work in her own rooms.
She greeted Barron with a friendly
hail, and they paused for a moment's
chat In the middle of the plaza.
"You're looking fresh as a summer
morning," said the mining man, whose
life, spent searching for the mineral
secrets of the Sierra, had not made him
conversant with those of complexions
like Mrs. Winers'.
"Oh, get out!" said she, 'greatly
pleased; "I'm too old for that sort of
taffy. It's almost Edna's turn now."
"I'll be afraid to see Edna soon.
She's going to be such a beauty that
the only safety's in flight."
The mother was even more pleased
at this.
"You're right," she said, nodding at
him with a grave eye; "Edna's a
beauty. Where she gets it from is
what stumps me. My glass tells me
it's not from her mommer, and my
memory tells me it's not from her pop
per."
"There's a man on your paper called
Essex," said Barron, "who was not one
to beat about the bush; "what sort of a
fellow is he, Mrs. Willers?"
"A bad sort, I'm inclined to think.
Why do you ask?"
"He was at the house the other after
noon, calling on Miss Moreau. j I met
him in the hall. I didn't cotton to him/
at all. She told me he was a friend of
yours and a writer on The Trumpet."
Â¦ He looked at her inquiringly, hardly
liking to go farther till she- gave him
some encouragement. . He noticed that
her expression had changed and that
she was eying him with a*hard, con
sidering attention. [
"Why didn't you like his looks?" she
said. â¢
"Well, I've seen men like that before
âat the mines. Good-looking chaps,
who are sort of imitation gentlemen,
not make'hardor unlovely, '
., "You've got to listen tome," he said,
shaking her arm as if trying to shake
some passion into the set antagonism
of her face; "you've got to be my
wife."
She suddenly seized her umbrella
I and, turning it toward him, pressed it
- down between them. The action was
so quick and. unexpected that the man
did not move bacK, and the. ferrule
striking him on the cheek, furrowed a
long scratch on the smooth' skin. A
drop of blood rose to the surface.
With an oath, he seized the umbrella,
and, tearing it from her grasp, sent it
flying into the street. Here the wind
snatched it, and its inverted shape, like
a large black mushroom, went sweep
ing forward, tilted and already half full
of water, before the angry gusts.'
Essex tried to keep his own over her,
still retaining his hold on her arm. #
"Come, be reasonable," he said;
"there's no use-angering me for noth
ing. This is a wet place for lovers to
have, meetings. Give me my, answer,
and I swear I'll not detain you., "When
will you marry me?" \ ?
"What's the good of talking that
way? You know perfectly what I'll
say. It will always be the same."
"I'm hot so. sure of that. I've got
something to say that may make you
change your mind."
He pushed the umbrella- back that the
light might fall directly on her. It fell
on him also. She saw his face under
the brim of his soaked hat, shining
with rain, pallidly sinister, the trickle
of blood on" one cheek.
"Nothing that you can say will ever
make me change my mind. Mr. Essex,
I am wet and tired; won't you please,
let me go?" , i
She tried to eliminate dislike and fear
from her voice and spoke with a gentle
ness that she hoped would soften him.
He heard it with a thrill; but it had an
exactly contrary effect to what she had
desired.
"I would like never to let you go. Just
to hold you here and look at you.-' Mari
posa, you don't know what this love is I
have for/' you. It grows with absence,
and then when I see you it grows again
again with the sight of you. It's eating
into me like a poison. I can't get away
from it. You loved me once, why have
you changed? What has come over you?
Is it because I made a foolish mistake?
I'm ready to do anything: you suggest â
crawl in the dust, kneel now in the rain,
and ask you to forgive it. Don't be hard
and revengeful: It's not like you. Be
kind, be merciful to a man who, if he
sdTd what hurt you, has repented it with
all his soul ever since. I am ready to
give my whole life to make amends. Say
you forgive me. Say you love me." â¢
He was speaking the truth. Passion
had outrun cupidity. Mariposa, poor or
rich, had become the end and aim of his
existence.
"It's not a question of forgiveness,"
she answered, seeing he still persisted
in the thought that she was hiding: her
love from wounded pride; "it's not a
question of love. I â I â don't like you.
Can't you understand that? I don't like
yon."
"IJ's not true â it's not true." he vocif
erated. "You love me â say you do."
He shook her by the arm as though to
shake the words out of her reluctant
lips. The brutal roughness of the action
spurred her from fear to Indignation.
"It's not love. It's not even hate. It's
just repulsion and dislike. I can't bear
to look at. you, or have you come near
me, and to have you hold me, as you're,
doing now, is as if some horrible thing
like a spider or a snake was crawling
on me.". ; ...Â»
Amid the rustling and the splashing of
the rain they again looked at each other
for a fierce, Â¦ pallid moment. Another
drop of blood on his cheek detached it
self and ran down. He had no free hand
* with which to wipe It off. â¢
"Yet you're going to marry me"," he
said softly.. j : - :.
I Tve heard enough of this," she cried.
"I'm not goinsr to stand here talking to a
madman. It's early yet and these
houses are full of people. If I give one
cry every window will go up. I don't
want* to make a scene here on the street,
but if you detain me any longer talking
in this crazy way, that's what I'll have
to do."
"Just wait one moment before you
take such .'desperate measures. I want
to ask you a question before you- call out
the neighborhood to protect you. How
do you think the story of your mother's
and father's early history will- look on
the front page of The Era?"
In the light' of the window -that fell
across them both he had the satisfaction
of seeing her face freeze into horrified
amazement.
"It will be the greatest scoop The
Era's had since - The Trumpet became
| Shackleton's property There's not a
soul here that even suspects it. It will
be a bombshell to the city." involving peo
ple of the highest position, like the
Shackletons. and people of the most un
questioning respectability, like the Mor
caus. Oh â it will be good reading!"
Her - eyes, fastened . on him, were full '
of anguish, but it bad not V bewildered
her. In the stress of the moment her
mind remained clear and active.
"Is the world interested in stories of
the dead?" she heard herself saying in
a cold voice. Â¦Â¦.Â¦Â¦Â¦. . .
: "Everybody's Interested In scandals.
And what a scandal it is! How people
will smack their lips over It! Shackle
ton a Mormon, and you his" only legiti
mate child. â¢â¢ Your mogier and father,
that all the world honored, common free
lovers. . Your mother sold to your father
for a pair of horses, arid living with him
in' a cabin in the Sierra for six months
before they even attempted to straight
en things out by a bogus marriage cere^
mony. Why, it's a splendid story! The
Era's had nothing with as much ginger
as that for months!" .
"And who'd believe you? Who are you
to. know about the early histories of the
pioneer families? . Who'd believe the
words of a man who comes from nobody
T*nows where, whose very name people
doubt? - If Mrs. Shackleton and I deny
the.'truth of your story, -who'd believe
you thent"
"You forget that I have under my
hand the man who was witness of the
transaction whereby . Moreau bought
your mother from Shackleton for a pair
of horses."
"A-drnnkrn thief! He stole all my
father had and ran, away. Can his word
carry, the same weight ' as mine to
â¢whose interest it â¢would be to prove my
self Shcckleton's . daughter? No. The
only real proof in existence -is the mar
riage certificate. And Â¦ I . have that. And
so long as , I have that any story you
choose to publish I ;can get up and .
deny." .'Â¦"â¢ , '
He knew she was right. Even with
Harney his . story .would be discredited,
unbacked by the one piece of genuine
evidence â¢ of the ,flrst marriage â the cer
tificate which she possessed. Her unex
pected v recognition : of the point stag-,
gered him. He had thought to break her
resistance by. threats which even to him,
seemed shameful, and only, excusable be
cause of the stress he found himself in.
Now he saw her as. defiantly uncon
quered as ever. ; In his rage he pushed
her back against the wall, crying: at her:
'"Deny,' deny, all .you like! â Whether
you ; deny. \ or not < thei thing /will ' have
been said.- Next Sunday the whole city,
;the whole' State will be. reading it â how

happiness and luxury and love, and on
the other?, disgrace and . poverty â not.
your disgrace alone. "but your. 1 father's,;
, "Good-by,"' said Barron, holding'out
his hand; "it's a good thing we had
this minute talk."
"Good-by," she answered, â¢ returning
the pressure with a grip almost as
manly; "it's been awfully good to see
you again. I must get a move on. So
long."
And they parted, Barron turning his
face toward the Garcia house, where
he had an engagement to take the boys
to the beach at the foot of Hyde street,
and Mrs. Willers hurrying ,- to The
Trumpet office.
Her walk did riot occupy more than
fifteen minutes, and during that time
the anger roused by the mining man's
words grew apace. From smothered
Indignation it passed to a state of sim
mering passion. Her conscience, heated
it still further, for it was she who had
introduced Essex to Mariposa, and in
' the first stage of their acquaintance
had in a careless way encouraged the
friendship, thinking it would be cheer
ful for the solitary girj to have the oc
casional, companionship of this clever
and interesting man of the world. She
had thoughtlessly kindled a fire that
might burn far past her power of con
trol and lead to irreparable disaster.
She ran up the stairs of The Trumpet
building with the lightness of a girl of
sixteen. Ire gave wings to her feet, and
it was ire as much as the speed of her
ascent that made her catch her breath
quickly at the top of the fourth flight.
Still, even then, she might have held
her Indignation In checkâ years of
training in expedient self-control being
a powerful force in the energetic busi
ness womanâ had she not caught a
glimpse of Essex In his den as she
passed the open door.
He was sitting at his desk, leaning
languidly back In his chair, evidently
thinking. His face, turned toward her,
looked worn, and hard, the lids droop
ing with their air of faintly bored in
solence.* Hearing the: rustle of her
dress, he looked, up and, saw her mak
ing a momentary pause by the door-;
way. He did not look' pleased at the
sight of her.
"Ah, Mrs. Willers," he said, leaning
forward to pick up his pen and speak
ing with the crisp clearness ' of Â¦Â¦ utter
ance certain people employ when Irrl- .
tated, "what is it that you want to see
me about?" , ; .
"Nothing," said Mrs. Willers abrupt
ly and with battle in her tone; ' "why
should I?"
. "I have not the least idea," Â» he '; an
swered, looking at his pen, and then,
dipping it in the ink, "unless "perhaps
you Â¦ want a .few' hints . for your 'forth- ;
coming article, 'The * Kind ; of iiShoe-;
strings Worn by the Crowned Heads of .
Europe."
Essex was out of temper, himself.;
When Mrs. Willers interrupted him he j
had" been thinking : over the situation
"Well," said Barron, "I'm glad you've
told me this. I'll keep my eye on Mr.
Essex. I was going to the mines next
week, but I'll put It off."
"Do. But don't let on to Mariposa
what I've told you. She wouldn't like
it. She's a proud girl. But I'll tell
you, Mr. Barron, she's a good one, too;
one of the best kind, and I love her
nearly as much aa my own girl. But
look!" glancing at an adjacent clock
with a start. "I must be traveling.
This stuff's got to go in at once."
Words of sufficient scorn seemed to
fail him. That he should be similarly
aspiring did not at that moment strike,
him as a reason for moderation In his
censure of a rival.
"And is he trying to scare her into
marrying him? I wish I'd known that.
I'd have broken his neck in the hall."
"Don't you go round breaking peo
ple's necks," said Mrs. Willers. "but I'm
glad you're in that house. If Barry Es
sex is going to try to make her marry
him by bullying and bulldozing her, I'm
glad there's a man there to keep him in
his place. That's no way to win a
woman, Mr. Barron. I know, for that's
the way Willem courted me. Wouldn't
hear of my saying no; said he'd shoot
himself. I knew even then he wouldn't,
but I didn't know but what he)d try to
wound himself somewhere where it
didn't hurt, leaving' a letter for" me that
would be published in the morning pa
per. So I . married him to ' get rid of
him, and then I had to get the law in
to get rid of him a second time. A
man that badgers a woman into mar
rying him is no good. You can bank
that."
Â¦ "Yes," said Barron, uneasy at her
tone and the strange look of almost
agitated astonishment on her face;
"and I'm under the Impression he said
something to her that frightened her.
As I was coming up the steps that, af
ternoon I heard distinctly 'some one call
out in the drawing-room. I burst in on
the full jump, for I was certain it was
a woman's voice, arid that man came
out of the drawing-room as I opened
the door. He was smooth as a summer
sea; said he hadn't heard a sound, and
went out smirking. Then I went into
the drawing-room to see who had been
In there and found Miss Moreau, lean
ing against the wall and white as my
cuffs."
He looked frowningly at Mrs. Wil
lers. She had' listened without moving,
her face rigidly attentive.
"Mariposa didn't tell you what they'd
been talking about?" she asked.
"No; she told me nothing. And when
I asked her about the screams she said
I'd been mistaken. But I hadn't, Mrs.
Willers. That man had scared her
some way, and she'd screamed. She
called for Benito and Mrs. Garcia,- I
heard her. And she's looked pale and
miserable ever since. What does that
blackguard come to see her for, any
way? What's he after?"
"Her," eaid Mrs. ,Willers, solemnly;
"he wants to marry her."
"Wants to marry her! That foreign
spider! Well, he's got a gall. Humph!"
and try. to make you take the imita
tion for the real thing by putting on
dog. I didn't like his style, anyhow,
and I don't think she does, either."
"You're right about that," . said Mrs.
Willers; "do you know what he was
there for?!' ' * - . â¢
â "Something. about music lessons, she
said. I didn't like to ask her."
"Music lessons!" exclaimed Mrs. Wil
lers, with a strong Inflection of sur
prise.
I termined. Oh, Count de Lamolle, it's
very hard to make determined people
see things differently to what they
want. So please, don't want to marry
me any more, for if you don't want to,
that will have to end it"
She stopped,- her lips trembling. The
Ccunt took her hand, cold and clammy,
and lifting it pressed his lips lightly
on the back. Then, dropping it, he
said, -quietly :
"All is understood. You have hon
ored me highly. Mademoiselle, by giv
ing me your confidence."
They stood silent for a moment. The
kiss on her hand, the something
friendly and kindâ so different from the
cold looks of unadmiring criticism she
was accustomed to â in the man's eyes
brought her uncomfortably close to
tears. Few people had been kind to
Maud Shackleton in the midst of her
riches and splendor. ,
The Count saw her emotion and
turned toward the fire. He felt more
drav.n to her than he had ever been
Â¦during his courtship. From the tail of
his eye he saw her little handkerchief
j whisk out and then Into her pocket.
| As it disappeared he said:
! "I see. Miss Shackleton, that you
1 have some albums of views on the
table. Might we not look at them to
gether?"
Thus It was that Bessie and Essex
found them. They had worked through
two volumes of Northern Italy, and
were in Switzerland. And over the
stiffened pages with their photographs,
not one-half of which Maud could re
member though she had been to all the
places on her trip abroad, they had
come nearer being friends than ever
before. .
"He's going to marry me some day.
He's Just Jack Latlmer. the stenog
rapher in the office. But I like him, and
that's all there is to it. But mommer's
terribly set on you. And she's so de-
he said, "the man can only obey."
Maud hung on his words. When she
grasped their import, ene suddenly
moved toward him. There was some
thing pathetic in her eagerness of grat
itude^
"Oh, thanks! thanks! I knew you'd
ao- it. It's not you I object to. I like
you better than any of the others.
But" â she glanced over her shoulder
into the lantern-lit brilliance of the
Moorish room and dropped her voice*
."there's some one I like more." '
â¢â¢Oh," eaid the Count, and his dark
eyes turned from her face, which had
become very red.

"Show: him in," fsaid^ Essex, "andâ oh
âahâ Jack, show Mrs.^Willers out."
Jack gaped at this curious order. Mrs.
Willers brushed past him ; and walked
up^ the hall to her own 'cubby-hole.
She .was compassed! in a' : lurid; mist "of
fury, and ; through this Â¦ she felt dimly

sank Into her desk chair. . â¢Â¦â¢ ;'/:.Â¦Â¦ ...'., Â¦"â¢:
Essex was startled by the stinging
malice revealed in this V remark. He
swung round; on his swivel chair, and
sat facing hi* antagonist, making no at
tempt tc/ rise, although she entered the
room. As he saw her face in the light
of the window he realized that for the
first time - he saw the woman 1 stirred
out of her carefully acquired profes
sional calm.
As she entered she pushed the door
to behind her, and, taking the chair be
side the desk, sat down. ' '
"Mr. Essex,"- she said, "I want a
word' with you."..
"Any number," he answered; with
ironical politeness. "Do you wish the
history of my connection with the
crowned heads as court' bootblack?"
"No," she said. "I want to know
what'business you've got to go to Mrs.
Garcia's boarding-house and frighten
one of the ladies living there?"
An instantaneous change passed over
Essex's face. His eyes seemed sud
denly to grow veiled as they~narrowed
to â¢ a cold, non-committal slit, j His
mouth hardened. Mrs. Willers saw the
muscles of his cheeks tighten.
"Really," he said, "this sudden inter
est in me is quite flattering." I hardly
know what to say."
He spoke to gain time, for he was
amazed and enraged. Mariposa had
evidently, made a confidante of Mrs.
Willers, and he knew that Mrs. Willers
was high In favor with WInslow
Shackleton and his'mother.
"In this country, Mr. Essex," Mrs.
Willers went on, clenching her hands
In her lap, for they trembled with her
indignation, "men don't scare and
browbeat young women who don't hap
pen to- have the 'good taste to favor
them. When a man gets the mitten he
knows enough to get out."
"Very clever of him, no. doubt," he
murmured with unshaken suavity.
"If you're going to live here you've
got to live by our laws. You've got to
do as the Romans do. And take my
word for it, young^man, the Romans
don't approve of nagging and scaring
a woman into marriage." *
"No?" he answered with a blandly
questioning. Inflection, "these are inter
esting facts in local manners and cus
toms. I'm sure they'd be of value to
some one who was , making a special
study of the subject. Personally I am
not interested in the California abor
igines. Even the original and charm
ing specimen now before me would
oblige me greatly by withdrawing. .It

on lib?} side of the desk â "half-past

I Mrs.- lWillers rose to her feet, burn
ing witn rage.
"Put me off any way you like," she
said, '"and be as fresh and smart as
you know how. But I tell you, young
man, this has got. to stop. That girl's
got no one belonging to her here. But

pet parrot No, sir: You've run up
against the wrong proposition . if you
think you can scare a woman into mar
rying: you in California In the nine
teenth century."
Â¦ Essex rose from his chair. He was
pale.
"Look here," he said in a low voice,
"I've had enough of this. By â¢ what
right. I'd like to know, do you dare to
dictate to. me or interfere in my ac
quaintance with another lady?"
"I'd dare more than that, Barry Es
sex," said Mrs. Willers, with her rouge
standing out red on her white face, ."to
save that girl from a man like you. 'I
don't know what I wouldn't dare. But
I'm a good fighter when my blood Is up,
and I'll fight you ; on this point ..till* one
or the other of us drops."
She saw Essex's nostrils fan softly In
and out. His cheek-bones looked prom
inent.
"Will you kindly leave this room?"
he said in a suppressed voice.
"Yes," she answered, "I'm going now.
But understand that I'm making no
idle threats. And if this persecution
goes on I'll tell Winslow Shackleton* of
the ; way you're acting, to a friend of
his and a protegee of his mother's." .

THE, SAN: -FRANCISCO SUNDAY' GALL.
3He tried the desk with an unsteady
hand. It was locked, but the insertion
of a steel file he carried broke the frail
clasp. It gave with a sharp click and
he stood, his hair stirring, watching the
top of her head. It dd not move, the
silence resettled, he could, again hear
her light, even breathing.
There wera many papers in the desk,
bundles of letters, souvenirs of old days
of affluence. He tossed them aside with
tremulous quickness until, underneath
all. he came on a long., dirty envelope
and a little chamois < leather bag. : He
lifted the latter. p It was -heavy and
emitted a faint chink. The old thief s
Shifting his position he pressed his
cheek against the glass and squinted in
sidewiso to where a deepening and quiv
ering of the light spoke of a fire. Then
he saw the figure of the sleeping woman,
lying in an attitude of complete repose
In the armchair. He gazed at her striv
ing to gauge the depth of her sleep. One
of her h/snds hang over the arm of the
-chair, with the gleam of the fire flicker
ing on the white skin. The same light
touched a strand of loosened hair. Â»Her
face was in profile toward him, the chin
pressed down on the shoulder. It looked
like a picture in its suggestion of pro
found unconsciousness. <
* He pushed fearfully on the cross-bar
of the pane, and the window rose a hair's
breadth. Then again, and it was high
enough up for him to insert his hand.
He did so. and drew forward the curtain
of heavy rep bo as to hide from the
sleeper the gradual stages of his en
trance. By degrees he raised It to a
height sufficient to permit the passage
of his body. The curtain shielded the
girl from the current of cold air that en
tered the room. He crept in softly on
his hands and knees, then rose to his
feet.
For a moment he made no further
movement, but stood, his gaze riveted
on the sleeper, watching for a symptom
of roused consciousness. She slept, on
peacefully, the light sound of her
breathing faintly audible.
The silence of the hushed house
seemed weirdly terrifying after the
tumult of the night outside. The thief
stole forward to the desk, his eye con
tinually turned toward her. When he
reached the table she war so far be
hind him that he could only see the
sweep of her wrapper on the floor, her
shoulder . and the top of her head over,
the chair back. *
The loud drumming of the rain on the
balcony roof drowned the crackle of the
tin under a feeling foot. To. slide there
from the limb only occupied a moment.
The branch had grown well up over the
roof, grating now and then against it
when the wind was high. The thin
streak of light from between the cur
tains made the man wary. Why was she
burning a light at this hour unless she
was sleepless and up?
Pressed close to the pane he applied
his eye to the crack which was the wid
est near the sill. He saw a portion of
the room, looking curiously vivid and
distinct in the narrow concentration of
his view. It seemed flooded with un
steady, warmly yellow light Straight
before him he saw a table with a rifled
tea-tray on it, and back of that another
table. The one eye pressed to the crack
grew absorbed as it focused itself on
the second table. Among a litter of
books, ornaments and feminine trifles,
stood a small desk of dark wood. It was
as if it had been placed there to catch
his attention â the goal of his line of
vision.
Then the men, waiting for the hour of
deepest sleep and darkness, continued to
sit, occasionally speaking, the light of
the leaping flames catching and losing
their anxious faces as the firelight in
another room was touching the face of
the sleeping girl of whom they talked.
It was nearly three when a movement
of life stirred the blackness of the Gar
cia garden. The rushing of the rain beat
down all sound; In the moist sodden
ness of the earth no trace lingered. The
pepper-tree bent and cracked to the
(rusts as it did to the additional weight
of the creeping figure In its boughs.
This was merely a shapeless bulk' of
blackness amid the fine and broken
blackness of the swaying foliage. It
stole forward with noiseless caution,
though it might have shouted and all
sound been lost in the angry turmoil of
the night. Creeping upward along the
great limb that stretched to the balcony
roof, a perpendicular knife-edge of light
that gleamed from between the curtains
of a window, now and then crossed its
face, sometimes dividing it clearly in
two, sometimes illuminating one atten
tive eye. a small shining point of life in
the dead murk around It, one eye. usjIow
with purpose, gleaming startlingly from
blackness.
He drew his chair to the other side of
the fire and began to talk â his voice low
and quiet at first, growing urpent and
authoritative, as Harney shrank before
the dangers of the work expected of him.
The moments ticked by, the fire growing
hotter and brighter, the roaring of the
storm sounding above the voices of the
master and the tool. The night was half
spent before Harney was conquered and
instructed.
"Big work, and with big money be
hind it," said the younger man; "and
when it's done we each get our share
and go our ways, George Harney."
"Have Is h&ve, however men rca.v, catch." â
Shakespeare.
Under cover of the darkness Essex
hurried down the street toward where the
city passed from a-place of homes to a
business mart. He had at first no fixed
idea of a goal, but after a few moments'
rapid march, realized that habit was tak
ing him in the direction of Bertrand's.
An Illumined clock face shining on him
over the roofs told him it was some time
past his dinner hour. He obeyed his in
stinct and bent his steps toward the res
taurant, throwing the cloak over the
fence of a vacant lot and wiping the
trickle of blood from his cheek with his
handkerchief.
He was cool and master of himself
once more. His brain was cleared, as a
sky by storm, wjid he knew that to
night's interview, must be one of the last
he would have with the woman who had
come to stand to him for love, wealth,
success and happiness. He must win or
lose all within the next few days. '
A half-hour later he was lighting the
gas in his own room in' Bush street. The
damp' air of the night entered through a
crack of opened window, introducing a
breath of sweet, moist freshness into the
smoke-saturated chamber. He threw off
his coat and lit the fire. As soon as it
had caught satisfactorily he left the
room, crossed the hall noiselessly, and
with a slight preliminary knock, opened
Harney's door. The man was sitting
there in a broken rocking-chair, reading
the evening paper by the light of a
flaming gas-jet. He had tho air of one 1
who was waiting, and as Essex's head
was advanced round the edge of the door
he looked up with alert, expectant eyes.
"Come into my room," said the young
er man; "there's work for you tornight."
Harney threw down his paper and fol
lowed him across the hall. It was evi
dent that he was sober, and beyond this
some new sense of Importance and pow
er had taken from his manner its old
deprecation. They were equals now, pals
and partners. The drunken type-setter
and one-time thief was still under Barry
Essex's thumb, but he was also deep in
his conf denco.
He sat down in his old seat by the
fire, his eyes on Essex.
"What's up?" he said; ."what work
have you got for mo such a night as
this?"
A NIGHT'S WORK.
She hastily took off her things and put
on dry ones, and then shrugged herself
into the thick wrapper of black and
white that had been her mother's. Even
her hair was wet. she found out as she
undressed, and she mechanically undid
it, and shook the damp locks loose on
her Bhoulder*. She felt penetrated with
cold, and still overmastered by fear. Ev
ery gust that made the long limb of the
pepper-tree grate against the balcony
roof caused her heart to leap. When she
opened the door to get her supper, the
glow of light that fell from Barron's
room, across the hallway, came to her
Â¦with a hall of friendship and life. She
stood listening, and heard the creak of
his rocking-chair, then smelt the whiff of
a cigar. He was close to her. She shut
the door, feeling her terrors allayed.
Ehe picked at her supper, but soon set
the tray on the center-table and took the
easy-chair before the fire. The sense of
physical cold was passing off. but tho in
describable' oppression and apprehen
sion remained. She did not know exactly
what she dreaded, bat she felt in some
vague way that she would be safer sit
ting thus clad and wakeful before the fire
than sleeping in her bed. Once or twice,
as the hours passed an? her fears
strengthened in the silence and mystery
of the night, she crept to her door, and
opening it. looked up the hall. The
square of light was still there, the scent
Suddenly she heard the thud of bis
feet behind her. An agony of fright
prized her. The Garcia house was at
least two blocks farther on, and she
knrw he would overtake her before then.
A black doorway with a huddle of little
trees, formless and dark now, loomed
close by, and toward this she darted,
crouching down among the small wet
trunks of the shrubs and parting the fol
iage with shaking hands.
There was a lamp not far off and in its
rays she saw him running up, still hold-
Ing the cloak in a black bunch over his
arm. He- stopped Just beyond where she
cowered, and looked irresolutely up and
down. The lamplight fell on his face,
and in certain angles she saw it plainly,
pale and glistening with moisture, all
keen and alert with a look of attentive
cunning. He moved his head this way
and that, evidently trusting more to
hearing than to sight. His eyes, no
longer half veiled in cold indifference,
swept her hiding-place with the preoccu
pation-of one who listens intently. He
looked te her like some thwarted animal
barkening- for the steps of his prey. Her
terror grew with the sight of him. She
thought if he had approached the bushes
she would have swooned before he
reached them.
Presently he turned and went down

tile crept out from among the shrubs

its unrestrained fury .soaked her to the

till she had rushed up the stairs and
opened the door of the glass porch. She
was fumbling in her pocket for the
latchkey, wtien the inner door was op
ened and Barron stood in the aperture,
the lighted hall behind him.
"What on earth has delayed you?" he
said sharply- "They're all at supper. I
was Just going down to Mrs. Wlllers' to
see what was keeping you."
She stumbled in at the door, and stood
in the revealing light of the hall, for the
moment unable to answer, panting and
drenched.
"What's the matter?" he said sudden
ly In a dlffarent tone and quickly step

"Traâ onlyâ only â frightened," she
rasped between broken breaths. "Some
thins frightened me."
She reeled and caught, against the
door-post. . ;
Tm all wet," Â»he whispered with
white lips; "don't let them know. I
don't want any dinner."
He put his arm around her and drew
her toward the Â¦lairs. He could feel her
trembling like a person with an asne and
her saturated clothes left rillets along
the stall's. -
When they were half way up he said:
"How did you get *o wet? Have you
been out In this storm without an um
brella?"
"I lost it/* she whiÂ«perÂ»d.
"Lost it?" he replied. "Where's your
cloak?"
"Somewhere," she esid vaguely,
"somewhere in the street. I lost that,
too."
They were at the top of the stairs. She
suddenly turned toward him and pressed
her face Into his shoulder, trembling Ilka
a terrified animal.
"I'm frightened," she whispered.
"Don't tell them downstairs. . Til tell you
to-morrow. Don't ask me anything to
night."
He took her into her room and placed
her in an armchair by the fireplace. He
lit the gas and drew the curtains, and
then knelt by the hearth to kindle the
fire, saying nothing and apparently tak
ing little notice of her. fine sat dully
watching him, her hands In her lap, the
water running off her skirts along the
carpet^
When be had lit the fire he said:
"Now, I'll go, and you take off your
things. I'll bring you up some supper in
half an hour. Be quick, you're soaking.
I'll tell them downstairs you're too tired
to come down."
He went out, softly closing the door.
She sat on in her wet clothes, feeling the
growing warmth of the flames on her
face and hands. 'She seemed to fall into
a lethargy of exhaustion and sat thus
motionless, the water running unheeded
on the carpet, frissons of cold occasion
ally shaking her. till a knock at the door
roused her. Then she suddenly remem
bered Barron and his command to take
off her wet clothes. 8he had them on
still and he would be angry.
"Put it down on the chair outside,"
she called thrÂ«fcgh the door; "I'm not
ready."
"Won't you open the door and take
this whisky and drink at once?" came
his answer.
She opened the door a crack and, put
ting her hand through the aperture, took
the glass with the whisky.
"Are you warm and dry?" he said; all
ehe could see of him was his big hand
clasped round the glass.
"Yes, quite," she answered, though she
felt her skin quivering with cold against
the damp garments that seemed glued.to
"Well, drink this now, right off. And
listen â " as the door began to close â "if
you cet nervous or anything Just come
to your door and call me. I'll leave mine

Then before she could answer she felt

and the door was shut.

With a cry of rage and despair Mari
posa tried to tear herself from him. Na
ture aided her. for at the same moment
a savage gust of wind seized the umbrel
la and wrenched It this way and that.
Instinctively he loosened his hold on her
to grasp it. and In that one moment she
tore herself away from him. He gripped
at the flapping wing of her cloak, and
caupht it. But the strain was too much
for the cheap metal clasp, which broke,
and Mariposa slipped out of it and flew
Into the fury of the rain, leaving the
cloak in his hand.
The roar of many waters and the
shouting of the wind obliterated the
Bound of her flying feet. The darkness,
shot through with the blurred faces of
lamps or the long rays from an occa
sional uncurtained pane, in a moment
absorbed her black figure. Essex stood
motionless, stunned at the suddenness
of her escape, the sodden cloak trailing
from his band. Then shaken out of all
reason by rage, not knowing what he In
tended doing. hÂ« started in pursuit.
She feared this and her burst of brav
ery was exhausted. As she ran up the
steep street having only the darkness to
hide her, her heart seemed shriveled
with the fear of him.
Barron sat on. till the dawn broke gray
through the hall- window. .He was .be
ginning to wonder if this girl. was the
central figure of some drama, secret, In
tricate and unsuspected, which was
working out to its conclusion. Â¦ .
A few minutes later the young widow
found him sitting on a chair under a
lamp In the hall
"Well." he said eagerly, "how is she?"
."She's come back to her senses ' all
right. But she doesn't seem to want to
tell what he took. She says It was a pa
per, ' and that's all. and; that she never
saw him before. Â¦ Mother doesn't Â¦ think
we ought to worry her. . She says she's
got a fever, and she's going to give her
medicine to make her sleep, and not to
disturb her till she wakes up. She's all
broken up and sort of limp and trembly.".
. "Well. I suppose the senora knows
best. It'll be light soon now, and I'll go
to the police station. The senora and
you will stay wlth^her?"
"O yes." said Mrs. Garcia, the younger.
"My" goodness, ', what a night's It's been!
It's lucky the man didn't get her money.
There was quite a lot; about five hun
dred-dollars. I should think. Oh, my"
curl papers! I forgot them. Gracious,
what a elsht I must look!" and she shuf
fled down the stairs.
With the assistance of old Mrs. Garcia
he lifted her and carried her to the bed.
One of her arms fell limp against his
shoulder as he laid her down, and the
old lady uttered an. exclamation. She lift
ed it up and showed him a curious red
welt on the white wrist. ,
"It's a burn," she said. "How did she
get that?"
"She must have .fallen against the
grate," . he answered. His eyes grew
dark as they encountered the scar. "As
soon as she's conscious tell me."
"All right. I'll wait till it gets light.
I'll lift her up now, If you'll get the bed
ready."
"Oh, but don't go till it gets light. The
window's broken and any one can come
in who wants." ... .
"There's nothing to be scared about.
The man's got what he wanted, and he'll
take precious good care not, to. come
back."
"Oh, don't leave us," Implored Mrs.
Garcia junior, "if there are burglars any
where round. Oh. please don't go. Pier
pont's away and we'd have no man in the
house. Don't go till morning. I'm just
as scared as I can be!"
"It was a> robber." said the old woman,
looking at the scattered gold, "but he
didn't get her money. What was It he
took. I wonder?"
"Some papers, I think," said Barron.
"that were evidently of value to her. I'll
lift her up and put her on the bad and
then I'll go. As soon as she's conscious
ask her what the man took and come and
tell me. and I'll go right to the police
station."
"We heard the most awful shrieks, and
we rushed up, and here she v/aa stand
ing and screaming: 'He's got it! He's
got it!' And then she fell flat, quite sud
denly, and has lain here this way ever
since."
The old lady, in' some wondrous and
Intimate deshabille, creett-d him eagerly
In Spanish, demanding what| had hap
pened. He told her all he knew and
knelt down beside the younger, Mrs. Gar
cia, who was attempting with' a shaking
hand to pour brandy between Marlposa's
set teeth.
In fifteen minutes Barron was back
and found the Garcia ladles .In Mari
posa's room, ministering to the girl, wlio
lay in a heavy swoon, stark anct white on
the hearth-rug. ';, ' - t Â¦' *
"Not the money â not the money," sho
shrieked, wringing her hands; "the pa
per â the certificate! He's got It and
gone, this way. through the window."
Barron grasped the fact.tha"t Â»he- had
been robbed of something other than the
money, the loss of which seemed to ren
der her half distracted. With a hasty
word of reassurance he turned and ran
from the room springing down the stairs
and across the hall. In the instant's
pause by the window he had heard the
sound of feet on the steps below and
judged that' he could- get down more
quickly by the stairs than by the limb of
the tree.
But the few minutes' start and the
darkness of the night were on the side of
the thief. The roar of the rain drowned
his footsteps. . Barron ran this way and
that, but neither sight nor sound of his
quarry was vouchsafed to him. The
man had got away with his booty, what
ever it was. - - ,
"He's got it!" she cried wildly, and
struggling to her feet rushed to the win
dow. "He's got it! Oh, go after him!
Stop him!"
"Got what?" he said. "No, he hasn't
got the money. It's all there."
He seized her by the arm, for she
seemed as if intending to go through the
broken window.
Harney made h dash for the open win
dow, but she caught him by the shoul
der and arm, and with the unimpaired
strength of her healthy .'youth struggled
with him hand to hand, reaching out for
the paper he tried to keep out of her
prasp. In the fury of the moment's con
flict, neither made any sound, but fought
like two enraged â¢ animals, rocking to
and fro, panting and clutching at each
other.
He finally wrenched his arm free and
struck her a savage blow aimed at her
head but falling on her shoulder, which
sent her down on her. knees and then
back against the fire. He thought he
had stunned her. and raised his ' arm
again when she sprang up, tore the paper
out of his grasp and pressed it with her
hand down into the coals beside her. As
she did so. for tho first .time she raised
her volco and shrieked:
"Mr. Barron! Mr. Barron! Come,
come! Oh. hurry!" '
From the hall Harney heard a move
ment and an answering. shout. With the
cries echoing through tho room he beat
her down against the grate, and tore the
paper, curling with fire on 'the edges,
fro mher hand. With It. he dashed
through the open sash, a shiver of glass
following him.
Almost simultaneously, Barron burst
into the room. He had been reading and
had fallen asleep to be waked by the
shrieks of the girl's voice, which were
still in his ears. The falling of broken
glass and a rush of cold air from the
opened window greeted him. Piled on
the table and scattered about the floor
were gold pieces. Mariposa was kneel
ing on tho rug.
At ; that moment the fire. - a heap of
red ruins, fell together, with' a small
clinking sound. It was no louder noise
than he had mado; when opening the
desk, but it contained some penetrating
quality the former^ had lacked. . Still
hesitating, with the sack of 'money in
his hand, he turned "again to the chair.
A face, white and wide-eyed, was star
ing at him round the side.
He gave a smothered ' oath and the
sack dropped from his hand to the table.
The money fell- from it in a clattering
heap and rolled about, in golden zigzags
in every direction. The sound roused
the still unawakened Intelligence of the
girl. She saw the paper in his hand,
half-opened, i Its familiarity broke
through her dazed senses. She rose and
rushed at him gasping:.,.
"The. certificate! the certificate!"
instincts rose jn him. But .', he first
opened the envelope, and softly, drew out
the two certificates, ; took:* the one he
wanted and put the other > back. , Then
ho opened the mouth of the bag. The
gleam of gold shone from the aperture.
Stricken with' temptation he stood hesi
tating. . . r .â¢...Â¦. .

It all seemed suddenly possible, almost
easy. Only, leaving would be hardâfear

passage and the vole* that In those first
days of her feebleness had called a greet
ing to her every, morning; the man's deep
voice with its strong, ; cheery, note. ( Ami
then like a peevish child, sick and unrea

it? There were three days yet before
Sunday. Might not something be done
in three days? But she could think
of nothing. Something had happened
to her brain. If there -as some one
to help her! *
And with that came the thought of
Barron. A flash of relief went through
her. He would help Her; he would do
something. She had no idea what, but
something, and. uplirted by the idea,
she opened the door and looked up the
hall. She felt a sudden drop of hope
when sho saw that his door was closed.
But she stole up the passage, watching
it. not knowing what she 'Intended say
ing to him. only actuated by tho de
sire to throw her responsibilities on
him and ask for his help. â¢
v Tho door was ajar and she listened
outside it. There was no sound from
within and no scent of cigar-smoke. She
tapped softly and receiving no answer
pushed it open and peerqd fearfully in.
The room was empty. \ The mark's
clothes were thrown . about careless
ly, his table littered with papers and
books. From the crevice of the
opened window came the smell and the
sound of the rain, with a chill, bleak
suggestion.
A sudden throttling sense of lonely
helplessness overwhelmed her. She
stood looking blankly about, at the
ashes of cigars in a china saucer,
at an old valise gaping open in a cor
ner. The room seemed to her to have
a vacated air, and she remembered
hearing Barron, a lew days before,
speak of going to the mines again soon.
Her mind leaped to the conclusion that
he. had gone. Her hopes suddenly fell
around her in ruins, and in his looking
glass she saw a blancned face that she
hardly recognized as her own.
Stealing back to her room sho sat
down on the bed again. The house was
curiously quiet, and m this silence her
thoughts -began once more to revolve
round the one . hope. Then sud
denly they broke into a burst
of rebellion. She could not bear it. She
must go, somewhere/anywhere to escape.
She would flee away like 'some hunted
animal and hide, creeping Into some dark
distant place and cowering' there. But
where would she go, and what would she
do? The world outside seemed one vast
menace waiting to spring on her. If her
head would stop aching and', the fever
that burned her body and clouded her
brain would cease for a moment,- she
could think and come to a- conclusion.
But nowâ ... . ;
And suddenly, . as she thought, a. whis
per seemed to come to her, clear and dis
tinct â¢ like a revelation â "You . have â¢ your
voice!" , ' .
It lifted her to her feet. For a moment
the pain and confusion of developing Ill
ness left her; and she felt a thrill of re
turning energy. She had it still, the one
great gift neither enemies nor misfor
tune could, take from her â her. voice!, -
hills at top speed, urged on" by lsis- de
sire to hear 'â¢ news of Mariposa. He
burst into the , house to find * it silent â
the. hall empty.. *As he was hanging his
hat on the. rack, young Mrs. Garcia ap
peared from "the kitchen, her bang some
what limp, though it was "still early in
.the. day. her face looking small and peak
ed after her, exciting night's vigil.
. Mariposa, was still, asleep, she said in
answer to his query. The senora had
given her a powerful sleeping draught
and had said that the rest would be the
boat restorative after 'such a shock. If,
after she' waked up. she showed symp
toms of suffering or prostration, . they
would -send- for the doctor. .
. A cautious inspection made i'.f ter dinner
by young Mrs. Garcia resulted i;v the in
formation that : Mariposa .=till slept. Bar
ro:i. who was' feverishly desirous to
Â¦ kn-Â»w ho*v she progressed and also anx
ious to learn from her the nature of the
lost document, was forred to leave with
out-seeing her. -A business engagement
of the utmost importance claimed him at
his office, at 2 or he would have awaited
her awakening.
It was nearly an hour later 'before this
occurred. The dru.? the genora had ad
ministered was a heroic remedy, relic. of
the days when doctors were a rarity ami
the medicine chest of the hardy Spaniard
contained few. but powerful potions. The
girl rose, feeling weak, and dizzy. F r
some time she found it difficult to clieei
her thoughts and sat on the edge of her
bed. eying the disordered room with un
comprehending glances. Bodily di?t:om
fort at first absorbed her mind. A fever
burned through her. her head ached, hsr
limb" felt leaden and stiff.
The siiyht of the opened desk- gave the
Jillip to her befogged memory, and sud
denly the events of tho night rushed back
on her with stunning force. She felt, at
first, that it must be a dream., But the
rifled desk, with the v money which Â¦ tha
Garcias had gthered up and laid in n,
glittering heap on- the 'table, told her of
its truth. The man's face, ypllow and
flabbjs with the dark line of the shaven
beard clearly marked on his jaw.-?,
and the friyhtened rat's eyes, came
back to her as he had turned in
the first paralyzed moment of fear.
With hot, unsteady hands, she searched
through the scattered papers and then
about the room. In the hope that he had
dropped tho paper in the struggle. But
all search was fruitless. She remem
bered his tearing it from her grasp as
Barron's shout had sounded in the
passage. He had escaped with it. Tho
irrefutable evidence or the marriage
was in Essex's hand. He had her un
der his feet. It was the end.
She began to dress slowly and with
constant pauses. Every movement
.seemed an effort: every stage of her
toilet loomed colossal before her. The
one horror of the situation kept revolv
ing in her brain, ane she found-it im
possible to detach her thoughts from
It and fix them on anything else. At
the same time she could think of no
way to escape or to light against it. -
Next Sunday it wou:c be In The Era.
Those words seemed written in letters
of fire on the walls, and repeated them
selves in maddening revolution in her
mind. It would, bo all there, sensa
tionally displayed as the other old
scandals had been. She saw the tragic
secret of the two lives that- had shel
tered' hers, the love that had be?n s<$
sacred a thing written of with all the
defiling brutality of the common scribe
and his common reader, for all the
world of the low and ignoblo to jeer
at and spit upon.

"A plague o" both your houMrf
They have made worms' meat of tat."
â¢.:-"r.t.r â Shakespeare.
It bad been close upon half -past two
when Harney had left the house in Bush
street. Essex at the window had heard
the sound of bis retreating feet soon lost
in the rush of the rain and had then re
turned to the fire. He had made a close
calculation of the time Harney should
take. To go and come ought not to oc
cupy more than a half-hour. The theft,
itself. If no mischances occurred, should
be accomplished in ten or fifteen min
utes.
As the. hands of the clock on the table
drew near three, the man rose -from his
post by the fire and began to move rest
lessly about the room. The house was
wrapped in the dead stillness of sleep.
â¢ round whleh the turmoil of .the storm
circled and upon which It seemed to
press. Pausing to listen, he could hear
the creak and groan of the old walls, as
the wind buffeted them." Once, thinking
he heard a furtive step, he 'went to the
door, opened it and peered out Into the
blackness of the hall. The stairs still
creaked : as if to a light ascending foot,
but his eyes encountered nothing but the
Impenetrable darkness, charged with the
familiar smell of stale smoke. .
. - Back in his . room he went to the win
dow and, throwing it wide, leaned out
listening. 'The rain fell with a continu
ous drumming rustle, through which the
chinks and gurgles of water caught In

sitting on a divan idly turning over somo

curiously gray and cold in the drear aft

his feet. "I thought you were sick in bed.

"Oh. I'm quite -well now," she said,

tree. I was dreadfully frightened then,
but I'm all right now. I've come to sing
for you."
"To sins for me!" he exclaimed: "but
you're not well enough to sing. You've
had a bad fright and you look â excuse
me" â lie took her hand â "you're burning
up with fever. Take my advice and go
upstairs, and as soon as Mrs. Garcia
comes in we'll get a doctor."
"Noâ no!" she said almost violently;
"I'm quite well now. My hand's hot and
so Ms -my head, but that's natural after
. thp fright I had last night. I want to
sing tor you now and see what you say
ali-nit my voice." ' .
"But. you know, you can't do yourself
justice -and I can't form a fair opinion.
Why do you want to sing this afternoon
when you wouldn't all winter?/' â¢
"\V(-11." she said, "I don't mind telling
' you. I'm going to Europe to study.. I've
just made up my mind."
"Going to - Ku rope! Isn't that very
sudden? But it. will be splendid! When
are you going?" % Â¦ -
"Soon â in a day or two â as soon as I
can get my things packed in my trunks."
He looked at her curiously. Her man
ner, which was usually calm and delib
erate, was marked by tremulous restless
ness. She spoke rapidly and like one la
boring under suppressed excitement.
"Come." she said, going to the piano
stool and pushing It nearer the keyboard,
"I'll be. very busy now and I don't want
to waste any time."
He moved reluctantly to the piano and
seated himself.
"Have you your music?" he asked.
"No, but I can sing what sime of your
pupils do. I can sing 'Knowcst Thou the
Land?' and Mrs. Burrell sings that.
Where is it?" , Â¦
Her feverish haste and nervousness
impressed him more than ever ss her
hands tossed aside the sheets of piled-up
music, throwing them about the piano
and snatching at them as they slipped
to the floor. From there he picked up
the Migrion aria which she had over
looked and spreading it on the rack
struck the first opening notes. She lean
ed over him to seethe first line and he
felt that she was trembling violently. He
raised his hands and wheeled round on
the stool.
."Miss. Moreau." he said, "I truly don't
think you're well enough to sing. Don't
you think we'd better put it off till to
morrow?"
"No. no â I'm going to^now. I'm ready.
I'm anxious to. I must. Begin again,
please." â¢
He turned obediently and began again
to play the chords of accompaniment. He
had been for a long time Intensely anx
ious to hear her voice, of which he had
heard so much. It irritated him now to
have her determined to sing when she
was obviously ill and still suffering from
the effects of her fright.
The accompaniment reached the point
where the voice joins it. He played soft
ly, alert for the first rich note. Maripo
sa's chest rose with an Inflation of air
and she began to sing. .
A sound, harsh, veiled and thin, filled
the room. There.' was ,no volume, nor
resonance, nor beauty In It. It was the
ghost of a voice.
The teacher was so shocked that for a
moment he fumbled in the .familiar ac
companiment. Â¦ Then Â¦ he went on, bend
ing his head low over the keys, fearful of
her seeftis his face. ? Sounds unmusical,
rasping' and discordant came from her
lips. Everything. that had once made it
rich and splendid was now gone, the very
vojums of it had dwindled to a thin, muf
fled thread, the color had flown from
every tone.
For a bar or two she went on, then
she stopped. Pierpont dared not turn at
first. But. he heard her behind him say
hoarsely: ,
. "Whatâ whatâ is It?"
Then he wheeled round and saw her
with wild eyes and white lips.
For a moment he could say nothlnsr.
Her appearance struck him with alarm
and he sat dumb on the stool staring at
her.
"What is it?" she cried. "What has
happened to it? Where la my voice?"
"It's â It's â certainly not In good condi
tion." he stammered.
"It'a gone," she answered In a wail of
ajrony: "it's gone. My voice has gone!
What shall I do? It's gone!"
"Your fright" of last night has affected
it." he said, speaking as ikindly as he
could, "and you're not well. I told you
you were feverish and ought not to sing.
Rest will probably restore it."
"Let me try It again." she said wildly.
"It may be better. Play again."
lie played over the opening bars again,
and once more she drew the deep breath
that In the past had always brought with
It so much of exultation and began to
sing. The same feeble sounds, obscured
as though passing through a thick, muf
fling medium, hoarse, flat, unlovely, came
with labor from her parted lips.
They broke suddenly Into a wild animal
cry of despair. Pierpont rose from the
stool and went toward her, where she
stood with her arms drooping' by her
sides, pallid and terrible.
"Don't look like that," he said, taking
her hand: "there's no doubt the voice
has been Injured. But rest does a great
deal and after a shock like last nightâ"
. She. tore herself, from him and ran to
the door crying:
"Oh. my voice! My voice! It was all
I had!" t
He followed her Into the hall, not know-
Ing what to say in the face of such a ca
lamity, only anxious to offer her some
consolation. But she ran from him, up
the stairs with a frantic Â¦ speed. As he
put his foot on the lower step he heard
her door. Â¦
â¢ He turned round and went back slowly
to hia ' room. He was shocked and
amazed, and a little relieved that he â¢
had failed to catch her, for he had.
no words ready for such a misfortune.
Her i voice was completely gone. She .
was unquestionably ill and nervoua â but â
He sat down on the "divan, shaking his
head. , He had never heard a voice
more. utterly lost and wrecked.
Barron's business engagement de
tained him longer than he had expeoted.
The heavy rain was shortening the al
ready short . February - day \ with a
premature, dusk .when he * opened the
gate of the Garcia house and mounted
theateps. ""â¢
He had made a cursory investigation
of the, ground under "> the 'pepper tree
when he went out In the early morning.
Now. before the light died, he' again
; stepped under | Its .brunches for a. more
thorough: survey. The foliage was so
thick that no grass Â¦Â¦ grew where the
tree's shadow fell, ana r.ie rain sifted
through it In occasional dribbles or

of the cigar pungent on the air. She
shut the door softly, each time feeling
soothed as by the pressure of a strong,
loving hand.
Some time toward tho middle 1 of tho
night the heaviness of sleep came on her,
and though she fought against it, feel
ing that the safety she was struggling
to maintain against mysterious menace
was only to be preserved by wakeful
ness, nature overcame her. Curled In
her chair before the crumbling lire, she
finally slept â the deep, motionless* sleep
of physical and mental exhaustion.
"Perhaps the robber came and took her
away," said Benito in a voice of terror.
No one paid any attention. As If .by
common consent all present fastened
questioning eyes on Barron. He stood
looking down, his brows knit. The si
lence of dumb uneasiness was broken by
the entrance of the Chinaman from the
kitchen. With the expressionless phlegm
of his race he lit the two hall gas jets,
gently but firmly moving the senora out
of his way, and paying no attention to
the silent group at the stair foot.
"Ching," said Barron suddenly, "have
you seen Miss Moreau this afternoon?"
"Yes." returned the Celestial, carefully
adjusting the tap of the second gas, "she
go out hap-past four. She heap hurry.
She look welly bad â heap sick I guess;
no umblella; get awful wet."
With his noiseless tread he retreated
up the passage to the kitchen.
"Well. I'll go," said Barron suddenly.
"She's Just possibly gone out to see some
one and will be back soon. Bat no um
brella In this. rain! Have her room warm
and everything ready."
- He turned round and in an Instant was
gone. 'The little group at the stalrpost
looked at one another with pale faces.
It was possible that Mariposa had gone
out to see some one. But the dread of
disaster was at every heart.
"That's what I told her. but she in
sisted. She was determnled to. She said
she was going to Europe to study." . â¢
"Going to Europe!" It was Barren's
deep voice that put the question this
time, Mrs. Garcia being too astonished
by this last piece of intelligence to have
breath for speech. "When was she go
ing to Europe?"
"In a day or two â as soon as she could
pack her trunks, she said. I don't really
think she was quite accountable for
what she said. She was burning with a
fever and she seemed in a tremendously
wrought-up state. - 1 think the fright of
the night before had quite upset her. I
tried to cheer her up, but she ran away
as if she was frantic. Have any of you
seen her?"
"No," said Mrs. Garcia, her voice curi
ously Hat. "She's gone."
"Gone?" echoed Pierpont. "Gone
where?"
"Wo don't any of us know. But she's
not in the house anywhere. And now it's
getting dark and â " .
There was a pause, one of those preg
nant pauses of mute anxiety, while each
eyed the other with glances full of ah
alarmed surmise.
i'Lost her voice!" ejaculated Mrs. Oar
ela in a low gasp of horror. "Good
heavens!"
The boys looked from one to the other
with the round eyes of growing fear and
dread. The calamity, as announced by
Pierpont, did not seem adequate for the
consternation it caused, but an oppres
sive sense of apprehension was in the
air.
"What made her want to sing?" said
the widow; "she was too sick to sing."
The opening of Fierpont's door roused
thsm. The young man appeared in the
aperture and then came slowly forward.
"Havo-you seen Miss Moreau?" he said
to young Mrs. Garcia.
"No," said Barron hurriedly; "but
have" you?"
"Yes; she was down in my room this
afternoon singing."
"Singing!" echoed the others in wide
eyed amazement.
"Yes, and I am rather anxious about
her. That's why I came out when I
iicard your voices. She's had a pretty
severe disappointment, I'm afraid. She
seems to have lost her voice."
They stood silent for a moment, eyeing
one another with faces of disturbed
query.
"No â that's what's so funny. I thought
she was sleeping an awful long time and
I Just peeked in and she isn't there. And
Benito's been all over the house and
can't find her. It seems so crazy of her
to g-os'out in all this rain, but her out
side things are not in the closet or any
where."
He burst Into the hall and then stood
still, the doorhandle in his hand. In the
dim light, the two Garcia ladies and the
two boys met his eyes, standing in a
group at the foot of the stairs. There
was something in their faces and atti
tudes that bespoke uneasiness and anxi
ety. . Their four pairs of eyes were fas
tened .on him with curious alarmed
gravity.
He kicked the door shut and said:
"How's Miss Moreau?"
The question seemed to increase their
disquietude.
"We don't know where she is,' 1 said
young Mrs. Garcia.'
"Isn't she in her room?" lie demanded.

ing. He moved so that, the .full- Â»*Â£Â£
fell'- on it through a Â»reak In Â¦ 4ho
branches. It was a' minute or j wo '*
fore he grasped its real meaning. ,um.
he knew the name of Lucy fjMttr.Wu
Mariposa had once toic him it had been
her mother's maiden name.
For a space he stoce motionless un
der the tree, staring at the paper, fo
cusing his mind on it. seizing on waifs
and strays from the past that surged to
the surface of his memory. It dazed
him at first. Then ho began to under
stand. The mysterious drama that en
vironed the girl upstairs began to grow
olear to him. This was the document
that had been stolen from her last
night, the loss of which had thrown
her into a frenzy of despair â the record
of a marriage between her mother ana
Jake Shackleton. , .
Without stopping to think further he
thrust it into his pocket and ran to
the house. As he mounted the porch
steps the scene of his first meeting
with Mariposa flashed suddenly like a
magic-lantern picture across his- mind.
He heard her hysterical cry of â He
was my father!" Another veil of the
mystery seemed lifted.
And now he shrank from penetrat
ing further, for ho began to see. " If
Mariposa. had some sore secret to hide
let her keep it shut in her own breast.
All he had to do was to give the paper
to her as soon as he could. In the mo
ment's passage of the balcony and the
pause while he inserted his latch-key
in the door he tried to think, how he
could restore It to her without letting
her think he had read it. The key
turned and as the door gave he decided
that it must be given her at once with
out wasting time or oothering about
comforting lies.

herj step the buoyancy of a wooc
nymph's. Her eye lingered with a lool
that was a caress'on nower and tree ant
shrub. The song she had been humming
passed from tune to words, and she sanj
sottly as she brushed through the chap
arral, snipping off a leaf, bending t(
pluck a-wild flower, pausing to aiimir
the glossy green of a munzanita . bush
Under the snadow of the pines she halt
ed by a rugged trunk, a point of vantag<
she had ' early discovered, and leanin{
her hand on the bark, surveyed the wile
prospect.
The sense of expectancy In the ah
seeraed.intensiaed. The quivering radi
ance of pink and gold pulsed up tne sk\
from a - point of concentration whlcf
every moment, brightened. The blu*
shadows in the camp grew thinner, tht
little wisps of mist that hung over th*
/river more> threadlike and . phantasmal
'A throw-back to unremembered days
â¢ came suddenly upon her with a mysteri
ous sense of familiarity. She seemed tc
.be repeating a dear, jongr dead experl
j ence. The vision and the dream of days
of exquisite well-being, care-free, cher
ished, were with her again. Faint re
currlng glimpses of such mornings
strong of balsam of pine and fir, musieu
Vvith the sleepy murmur of a river, se
rene and sweet with an enfolding passloi
of love in which she rested secure, rost
- out of the dim places of memory. Th<
perfect content of her girlhood spoke. tc
her across the gulf of years, finding it,
self repeated in her womanhood." Tlu
old joy in livinjr. the old. thrill of wondei
and mystery, the old sense of safety in e
surrounding, watchful love were hen
once more.
The song on her lips passed from its
absent undertone to notes gradually f ui;
and fuller. It was the aria from "Mis
non," and. as- she stood.-her hand on the
tree trunk, looking down into the swim
ming shadows of. the camp. It swelled
outward in tones strong and rich, vibrat
ing with their lost force.
Pervaded by a sense of dreamy happi
ness, she at first failed to notice the un
expected volume of sound. Then, as note
rose upon note, welling from her chest
with the old-time, vibrant facility, aa
she felt once again the uplifting sense
of triumph possess. her. she realized
what it meant. Dropping her hand from
â¢ the tree trunk she stood upright, and
facing the dawn, with squared shoulders
and raised chin, let her voice roll out
into the void before her. ' â¢
? The. song.-. swelled triumphant like a
hymn of some pagan goddess to the ris
ing sun. In the stillness of the dawn
hush, with the columns of the monumen
tal pines behind her, the mountain wall
and the glowing sky in front, she might
have been the spirit of youth and love
chnntinj? her joy in-a primeval world.
When the last note had died away
she stood for a moment staring be
fore her. Then suddenly she wheeled,
and, catching up her skirts with on*
hand, ran bade' toward the house, brush
ing between the tree trunks and through
the chaparral with breathless haste. .As
sbe emerged from the thicket she saw
her husband, in his -rough mining clothes,
standing on the. top step of the balcony.
"Gam!" she cried, "Gam!"
He started, saw her, and then waited
smiling as she came xunning up the gar
den path toward him. the blaze of the
sky behind her, her face alight with life
and color. *
"Why, dearest, I didn't know what had
happened to you," he cried. "Where did
you go?" . â¢
. Her unslackened Â«peed carried her up
the stairs and into his arms. Standing
on the step below him she flung hers
round his shoulders and, holding him
tight. 4 said breathlessly: .
"What do you think has happened?"
"You met a bear in the wood."
"My voice has come back."
The two pairs of eyes, the woman's
looking up, the man's down, gazed deep
ly into each other. There was a moment
of silence, the silence of people who are
still unused to and a little overawed by
their happiness. ?.,.v.>;\<-t
"I heard vou." he said.
"You did? From here?"
"Yes. , I heard some one singing and
stood here listening, watching the light
coming up." â¢
"Was it good?" she asked, anxiously.
"Very. I had never heard you sing be
fore. . You're a prima donna," -
"That's what I was going- to be. You
remember hearing us talking about It at
the Garcias' 7' Â¦ .
He nodded, looking down at the face
where health was coming back in deli
cate degrees of coral to lips and cheeks.
"And it really did sound good?" she
queried again.
"Lovely."
"Quite soft and full, not harsh and
with all the sound of music gone out
of ltr ' . .
"Not a bit. It was fine."
She continued to hold him round the
shoulders, but her eyes dropped away
from his. which regarded her with im
movable earnestness, touched by a slight,
tender humor. She appeared to. become
suddenly thoughtful.
"You can be a prlma donna still, he
said. ' ' . . â¢
"Yes," she answered, nodding slightly.
"I suppose I can." .
"And it's a great career." :; v'
"Yes, a splendid career."
"You travel everywhere and -make a
fortune."
"If you're a success."
"Oh, you'd be a success all right."
,She drew away from him. letting one
hand rest on hi3 shoulder. Her face had
grown serious. f>he looked disappointed.
-"Well, do you want me to be a prima
donna?" she asked, looking at her hand.
He continued to regard her, without
answering, the gleam of amusement dy
ing out *f his eyes. "
"Of course," she added in a small
voice, "if you've set your heart on it, I
will ".
"What do you think about it yourself ?"
he asked. ;
She gave him a swift side look, just a
raising and dropping of the lashes.
"Say what you think, first," she coaxed.
- "Well. then. I will."
lie put his two hands suddenly on her
shoulders, big. bronzed hands, hard and
muscular, that seemed to seize upon her
delicate flesh with a master's grip.
"Look at me," he commanded.
She obeyed. .The gray eyes held hers
like a magnet. . - - - Â¦ Â¦Â¦ ' . . -
"I think no. You don t belong to the
public; you belong to me."
'The color ran up into, her face to the
edge of her hair. .:
"Oh. Gam," she whispered on a rising
breath. "I'm so relieved." Â¦
He dropped his hands from her shoul
ders and drew her close to him. With
his cheek against hers he said softly: ..
"Yr>u didn't think I was that kind of
a foo], did you?".
The. sun had risen as they talked, at
first slowly peering with a radiant eye
over the mountain's shoulder, then shak
ing itself free of tree-top and rock-point,
and swimming up Into the blue. The top
of the range stood all glowing and gold
en! with here -and there a white peak,
enowily . enameled. The rows of pines
wer* overlaid with a rosy brilliance,
their long shadows slanting down the.
slopes as if scurrying awÂ«y from the
flood of heat and light. The clear blues
and' amethysts that veiled the hollow of
the camp were dispersed: the films of
mist melted; a quivering silvery sparkle
played over the river shallows.
In the clearing beams the life of tho
hive below seemed to swarm and fill the
air with the clamor of its awakening.
The man and woman,. looking down, saw
the toiling world turning to its day's
work â the red dust rising beneath grind
ing hoof and wheel, the cars sliding
swiftly on their narrow; tracks, heard
the shouts of men, - the- hum of machin
ery, and " through : all and over all. thÂ« .
regular' throb of the* engines 'like the>
heart which animated this isolated world
of labors ' *
Barton looked at his domain for an at
tentive moment. -
-"There."- he said, pointing down. "Is
where I belong. That's my. lifeâ to work

her. and carried her down.* the policeman

helped him into. the carriage, not saying
much, 'while the boy stood with his now

= spoke to any of them. A, vague thought
crossed his mind that h<Â» would go to see
the boy some day and thank him. :
- * She- lay with her head on his shoulder,
and afc the carriage passed: the first lamp
. of the route he leaned iorv/ard engerly to
scan her: face. It was haggard, white
and- thin,. as by a Ions illness.- He could
.v not 'speak for a momrnt, could only hold
iherln his arms ax if thus to wind her
roundwith the symbol'of his love. Â¦ .
> Presently she groaned, and he said:
â¢ "Are you suffering?" ' .
â¢ ; -"Yes," she murmured, "always now. I
* am sick. I don't breathe well any more.
It hurts in my chest all the time.".
; "Why did you hide under thoso trees?"
he asked. -; .
I ; . "I was too sick to go any farther. I
[ wanted to hide somewhere. . to get away:
from it all. and anyway, till Sunday was
over. -It was all to be published on Sun
day, \ you know. Everything was ruined.
My voice was. gone, too. I saw those
â¢ steps in the dark and climbed up and
crept under the trees. I was terribly
.tired, ,and It was vei^ quiet up there. I
don't remember much more."
As the light of another lamp flashed
through the window he could not bear to
Â¦ look at her, but tightetted his arms
' Rbout^ her and bowed his face on her wet
, head. Â¦ \- Â¦ â¢ Â¦
"Oh God, clearest." he whispered,
"there can't 1 be any hell worse than what
I've been in for th.e last two days." .
She made no response, but lay passive
ly against him. When the carriage
stopped at, the -Garcia j?ate, and he told
her they were home, she made no at
1 tempt to move, and he saw she was un
conscious.
He lifted her out and carried her up
the steps. The door opened as he as
: cended and revealed the Garcia family
in the aperture.
"Is she dead?" screamed young "Mrs.
Garcia, as she saw the limp figure in his
arms.
"No. but sick. You must get a doctor
at once."
"Oh, how awful she looks!" cried the
young woman, as she caught sight of the
white face against his shoulder. "What
are you going to do with her?"
."Take her upstairs now, and then get
a doctor and get- her cured, and' when
she's well, marry her.".
EPILOGUE.
THE PRIMA DONNA.

: Beside me alnrlnr in the wilderness."
: Omar Khayyam.
The plant of the Silver Star mine lay
scattered along the edge of a mountain
river on the site of one of the camps of
forty-nine. "Where the pioneers had
scratched the surface- with their, picks.
â¢ their successors had torn wounds in the
Sierra's mighty flank. Where once the
miners' shouts had broken the quiet har
monics of stirred pine boughs, and sing
ing river, the throb of engines now beat
on the air, thick with the dust, noisy
with the strife of toiling- men.
Â¦ It : was a | morning | in j the end of May.
The "mountain wall was dark against the
rising sun; tall fir and giant pine stood
along its crest in inky silhouette Â¦'
thrown out by a background of gold leaf.
Here and there, far and: aerial in the
clear, cool dawn, a white peak of the
high Sierra floated above the shadows, a
rosy pinnacle,! The air was chill and
faintly touched with woodland odors.
The expectant hush of Nature awaiting
the miracle of sunrise, held this world of
huge, primordial forms, grouped in co
lossal indifference round the swarm of
men who delved in Its rock-ribbed breast.
In the stillness the camp's awakening
movements rose upon the morning air
with, curious distinctness. Through the
blue shadows in which it swam the tall
chimneys soared aloft, sending their
feathers of smoke up to the new day. It
lay in its hollow like a picture, all trans
parent washes of amethyst and gray,
overlaid by clear mountain shadows. The
world was in this waiting stage of
flushed sky and shaded, earth when the
superintendent's wife' pushed open the
door of her house and with the cautious
tread of one who fears to wake a sleeper
stepped out' on the balcony.
With her hand on the rail she stood,
deeply inhaling the - freshness of the
hour. The superintendent's house, a one
story cottage, painted white, and skirted
by a i broad.ibalcony, stood on an emi
â¢ nence above the camp. â¢ From its front
"steps she looked down on the slant of
many roofs, the car tracks and .the red,
wagon roads that wound along the
slopes. Raising her eyes, they swept the
ramparts of the everlasting hills, and
looking higher still, her face met the ra
diance of the dawn.
She stepped off- the balcony with the
Fame cautious tread, and along the beat
en footpath that led through the patch of
garden in front of 1 the house. Beyond,
this the path, wound through a growth
of chaparral to where the pines ascended
the slopes in climbing flies. As she ap- '
proached she ;saw the- sky .barred with
their trunks, arrow-straight and bare of
branches to a great height. Farther, on
she could see the long dim aisles, held

heart, i and; .she walked forward with a
light step, humming to herself. Two i
months before she had come here, a bride
from- San Francisco, weak from illness,
pale, hollow-eyed, a shadow: of her for
mer self. She had only crept about at
first, swung for hours on the balcony in
her- hammock, or sat under the trees
looking down on the hlveof men, where [.
her husband worked among his laborers.

To-day she -had awakened with I the

where he's been, for a week, .and I- was
bringing him home. When he got to' the
top of the steps he began sniffing round
*and : barking, and .then he. < ran to a place
wher-? , there's a little sort of ; bunch of
fir trees and barked andjjumped round,
and went in aniony^the trees. I followed
him "to see what was up. and" all of a
sudden I heard some one gay.lrom under
the trees: . *Oii, it's only a dog.' T I was
scared and ran into the house and sot a
lamp, and when i came out with Â¦my
mother, and we. went in among the trees,
there was a woman In there,' who was ly-;
ing on the ground. When she saw us she
sort -of -sat :Up, as if she'd been asleep,
and said: 'Is it Sunday yet?'. We saw.
her distinctly;, she was staringf right at:
us. She didn't look as if she vas crazy,
but we both thought she was. . She was
terribly white. "We knew she couldn't be
drunk, because she was like a lady â she
spoke that way." . ' x
"And then â and then," said Barron;
"what did she do?" Â¦
"She: said again, 'It isn't Sunday yet?"
and .mother "said, 'No, not yet,' and wo
went away, l ran to the police office, but
we left one of the Chinamen to watch su
she 'wouldn't get away, .'cause we didn't
know whnt; was the matter with her.
..We'll 'be t!iere : in a minute now. It isn't

â The hack, which had been rattling
round corners at top speed, now began to
useend. Barron -could see - the gaunt

"Do you guess it's the lady you're .
hunting?" said the policeman politely.
__ "I'm ; almost certain it is," answered'
Barron. "Can't you make this man- go
faster?" .' .; - - Â¦ "- Â¦ -'Â¦ ". "Â¦ 'Â¦. ' .:' â¢?.
,'Tho hill's pretty steep here," said the
guardian of the city's peace. "I don't
seem to think he could do it."
\ "We're, almost there." said/the boy;
"it's just that housewhere the aloe is â
there on the top of that high wall." 1 j
Barron looked in the direction and saw
high above them, on the; top; of a wall*
like the rampart of a fortress, the faint
outline ofrri house and the black masses
of trees etched against the only slightly
paler. sky. :Â¦-..*'Â¦,
VI don't sec any aloe," he growled; "is
that the house you mean?" 'Â¦Â¦-..
"That's It." said the boy. "I guess it'3
too dark for the aloe to-night."
Â¦With a scrambling and .jolting the
horses began wh%t appeared an even 1
steeper climb than that of the block be
fore. The beasts ssemed Â¦ to : dig their
hoofs into the crevices between the cob
bles ar.d to clamber perilously up.. With;
Â»n oath Rarron kicked open the door and
sprang out.
'"Come on. boy," he shouted. .'-'I can't
stand this snail of a carriage any long
er." And he set out running 'up the hill.
The boy, who Â«- was light of foot and
young, kept up with -,nim, but ;the two
heavier men, who had followed, were left
behind,' puffing and blowing In the dark
ness. '
Suddenly the great wall, at the base of
which they ran, was crossed by a flight
of stairs that made two oblique stripes
across its fare. ' >
"Up the stairs." said the boy.
And Barron, without reply, turned and
began the ascent at the same breakneck
speed. " .
"You may as well let me go first,"
gasped his conductor from behind- him.
"You don't know the way, and you might
scare the Chinaman. He said he had a
gun." .
Barron stood aside for him to pass and
then followed the nimble figure as It
darted up the second flight. The boy was
evidently nearing the top, when he sang
out: . â¢ , . - t v .*
"Ah. there, Lee! It's mecomlnr back."
There was an unmistakable Chinese
guttural from somewhere, and then Bar
ron himself rose above the stair-top. <â¢ A
black mass of garden lay before him.

distance back. Many windows were lit,
and in one he saw a woman * standing.

frpm the house and on the unseen walk

In a hissing whisper. - '
The Chinaman's affirmative grunt rose
from the darkness of the massed trees,
into which his footsteps continued to re
treat. Â¦ . 'Â¦; - ' . ; Â¦/Â¦' -"Â¦
, "This way." said his conductor to Bar
ron. "Cut hang it all, it's so dark we

"Where is she?" said Barron. "Never

which, though low, had a quality so
thrilling it might have penetrated the
jar of death. -,>Â¦- ~~ ~
The garden, rain-swept and rustling,
srew quiet. The sound of . the ' China- :
man's footsteps ceased, even the panting
breath of the boy was suddenly suspend

In this moment of pause, when nature

"Who called me?" V. ' â¢
The sound ''broke the ; agony that had
congealed Barron's heart. With a shout
nc answered: Â¦

Thr. voice rose again, faint, -but with â¢
ioy in it. :
"Oh. have you come â have you come,

He. made a rush forward Into Â¦ the

The policeman, with a soft ejaculation, '\
urned the lantern, and its. cube of light r<
ell into the heart of a bed of petunias; i
hen the two men and the boy stood look- . i
ng at it silently for a space. '< - ' 1
old lady persuaded him to drink, a cup
of coffee'she had kept warm.' and, as she
gave it him, looked with silent compas
sion into his haggard face. . /*
When day broke he had not- again ap
peared. Hy this time the household was
in. a ferment of open alarm. The ;boyo
weie retulned from school, as it was felt
th*.v might be needed for messages. Pier
pont undertook to visit all Mariposa b
.pupilr. in the dim hope of ' finding
through them some clew to her : move- .
ments. though it was well known she.
was on intimate terms with . none . of, '
them.' Soon after breakfast- Mrs. Willera '
appeared, Â¦Â¦ uneasy, and by the time the
now weeping Mrs. . Garcia had told her
all. pale and deeply disturbed. ' -.
Sho 'repaired' to the Trumpet office
without loss of time, and there acquaint" *
ed her chief , with, the story of Miss. Mo
reau's disappearance, not neglecting to
mention the burglary of the night before,
which even to the women, having no
knowledge of its real import, seemed to
indicate a sinister connection with sub
sequent events. Winslow did not disap-;â¢-.
point Mrs. Willers by pooh-poohing tho
matter, as she had half imagined he y
would; a young lady's disappearance for
twelve hours not ; being a subject for
such tragic consternation. He seemed
extremely worried â in fact, showed an <
anxiety that struck the head of the wo
man's page as almost odd. He assured â
her thatdf Miss Moreau was not heard
irom that day by mid-day he would se
cretly offer to the police department the
largest reward ever given in San Fran
cisco lor any trace or tidings of her. -
Meantime, Barron, having assured
himself by visits to all the ticket offices
that she, had not left the city on any
train, had finally taken his case to the
police. It had been In their hands only
aii hour or twd when young Shackleton's
offer of what, in even those extravagant
days, seemed an enormous reward, was
communicated to the department; It put
life into the somewhat dormant energies
of the officers detailed on the cass. Mari
posa had not been missing twenty-four
hours when the search for her was
spreading over the face of thft city,
where she -had been so insignificant a
unit, in a thorough and secret network ,
of investigation.
The day wore away with madding
slowness to the women in the house,
whose duty it was to sit and wait. To
Barron, whose anxiety had been intensi
fied by the torture of his deeper knowl
edge of the girl's strange circumstances,
existence seemed only bearable as it v/as
directed to finding her. He did not dare
now to pause or think. Without stop
ping to eat or rest he continued his
search, now with the detectives, now
alone. Several times in the course of the
day- he reappeared at the Uarcin house,
drawn thither by the hope that she might
have returned. The senora. with the cu
rious tranquillity of the very old which
seems not to need the repairing pro
cesses of sleep or food, was always to be
found sitting by the kitchen stove, upon
which some dish or drink simmered for
him. ..life rarely stopped to take either.
But returning in the early dusk, he was
grateful to find that she had a dry over
coat hanging before the fire for him. The
rain still fell in torrents, and the long '
day spent at its mercy had soaked him. i
It w,n8 between ten and eleven o'clock
at night that the old lady and her daugh- '
ter-in-law. sitting before the stove, as . 1
they had done the evening before, again i
heard his step and key. This time there
was no pretense at expectation on either I
iside. Hi3 first glance inside the room
showed him the heavy dejection of the i
two faces turned toward him. They, on j
their part, saw him pale and drawn, as
by a month's illness. They had heard 1
nothing. No investigation of which they <
wore aware had brought in a grain of <
comfort. He had heard worse than noth- <
ing. There had been talk at the police
station that evening of the finding of
George Harney, suffering from concus- I
sion of th<s brain, and the sudden depart- i
uro of Barry Essex, believed to be his 1
assailant. - i
TliN information added the last straw <
to B^rron's agony of apprehension. It *
seemed as If a plot had culminated in '.
those two days, a plot dark and inex- i
plicable, in which the woman he ldved 1
was in some mysterious way involved. .. 1
He was .standing by. the stove respond- ; t
ing to the somber queries of the. women, c
when the - sound of - feet on tho. porch'. "
pteps suddenly transfixed them all. i
Young Mrs. Garcia screamed, while the
old lady sat with head bent sldewise Us-- i
tenlng. Before Barron could get to' the i
door a soft ring at the bell had drawn t
another scream from the younger wo
man, who, nevertheless, followed him .r
and stood peeping into the hall, clinging 1 c
to the dooVpost. Â¦ . :
The opened door sent a floods of light r
over three figures huddled in the glass!
porch â two men. a detective and police-
man. Barron already knew, and a third, t
a stranger to him. whose face against ft
the shadowy background looked fresh
and boyisli. Â¦ f
"Ah. Mr. Barron, we're lucky to strike r
you this way at the first shot," said the I
detective. "We think we've found the â¬
lady."
"Found her? Where? Have you got f
her there?" ;- J"
"No; we're not certain yet if, it's the-/
right one."
The man, as he spoke, entered the hall,
the policeman and tho stranger following c.
him. Under; the flare of the two gas jets r
they looked big ungainly figures in their
smoking rubber capes that ran rlllets of t
ivater on the floor. The third, revealed
in the full light, was a boy of some four- j
teen or fifteen years, well" dressed and -
with the air of r eentleman. a
"This gentleman came to the station a
half-hour ago." said the policeman. Indl- I
crating- the stranger, "with a story of r
rinding a lady on his own grounds, and t
we thought from his description it was v
the one you're looking for." . 1:
Barron directed on the youth a glance
that would have pried open the lips of t
the Sphinx. v
"What does she look like? Where is
she? ' s
j "She's in our garden." snid the boy. n
jndcr some trees. She looks till and c
iuH.on black clothes. vv6 has dark red t
mir and a very white fncÂ»." a
Â¦Mrs. Garcia gave a loud cry from the [1:
jackground. . . â¢ h
"It's Marlf-'sa, sure," she soroamed. o
'Is she alive?" - o,
"Alive!" echoed the youth. "Oh. yes; a
she's quite alive, but 1 don't know
whether she's exactly in her. right- mind.' > u
She's sort of queer. *1'
Barron had brushed past him into tho .1
streaming night. . t
"Come on." he shouted back.' "Good t
l*>rd. come quick!" s
At the foot of the zigzag stairs he saw d
he two gleaming lights of a back, y With 'I
he other, men clattering at his heels, ho 1<
lashed down the steps, and was in; it, 1;
rhaftng and swearing, whilo they were
'umbling for the latch of the gate.- -. . t
As the boy,;after giving the coachman a
in address, scrambled in beside -him," he s
;aM peremptorily: Â¦Â¦ Â«
"When did you find her? /i'cll me f
iverything." , . â¢ a
"About two hours ago. My dog found
ler. I live, I and ray mother.,on the ti
:lope of Russian Hill.. It's quite a big % f.
ilace with a lot of trees. I went down 1 ; t!

ligure with the cane.
"uamii!" he eald under his breath,
"he's fainted."
And "throwing" tho cane away, he ap
proaclied tlvs man and bent over him.
Yhrre was no sound of breathing or
* pulse of life aooui the sodden ngure

Kssex's forehead Â« .* he turr.cd It over.
Then, as it confronted him. livid with
fallen jaw and a git-am of wuite between
the wrinkled eyelia, the drops ran down
his lace. â¢ . â¢
With a hand that shook as Harney'3
had a fow moments before he felt the
. pulsr> and tin-it tore tnÂ« shjrt open and
tried tne heart, iiis face was white as
tim man's on the Ooor as he poured whis
ky down |hÂ« tnrout tnat refused to swal
low, riually. tearing- off his coat, he
knelt bc&Idu hia victim and tried every
means ii< his power to bring back life
into the miserable body in wnicii ne had
only recognized a tool of his own. But ,
then- was no response. The minutes
ticked o::. and there wats no glimmer of :
intelligence m the cold indifference of
the eyes. n<> warmth round the stilled
heart, no lluttcr ci breath at the slack,
gray lips.
The night was still dark, the rain in
his ears, when ho rose to his feet. A
horror unlike anything he had ever
imagined was on him. All the things in
lif'j ho had struggled for seemed snriv
ole<l to nothing'. The whole worth of hi3
existence was contained in tne unlovely
>body on the floor. To bring life back to
it he would have given his'dearest ambi
tion â sacrificed love, money, happiness â
all for which he had held life valuable
and. thought himself blessed. What a few
hours beiore were ends to struggle and
'sin lor seemed now of no moment- to
him. MaripOEa had faded to a dim, un
de.sired shadow; tho millions she stood
for to dross he would have passed with
out a thought. How readily would he
have given it all to bring back tho
breath to thti creature he had held as a
worm beneath his foot!
He seized the table cloth and threw it
over the face whose solemn, tragic calm
tilled him with a sick dread. Then with
breathless haste he flung some clothes
into a valis? and made the fire burn high
with the letters and papers he threw on
it at intervals. The first carts of the
morning had begun theirs rattling course
through the .stirred darkness when he
crept out, a haggard, hunted man.*
He had to hide himself in unfrequented
corners, cower beneath the shadow of
trees qn park benches till the light
strengthened and morning shook the city
into life. Then, as its reawakening tides
boyan to svirge round him. he made a
furtive way â lor the first time in his life
fearful of his fellow men â to the rail
way station, and there took the earliest
southbound train for the Mexican border.
The fire had died down, the leaden light
of coming day was filtering in through
the crack between the' half-drawn cur
tains, when the shrouded shape- on the
floor moved and a deep groan broke upon
the stillness. Another followed it.
GToars of physical anguish beating on
awakening consciousness. An early riser
from the floor above heard them as he
Rtole downward, stopped, listened,
knocked, then receiving no reply, opened
the door and peered fearfully in. In the
dim room, cut with a sword of faint
light, he saw the covered shape, and, as
he stood terrified, heard the groan re
peated and saw the drapery twitched..
Shouting his fears bver the balustrade,
he rushed in. flung the curtains wide,
tore off the table cloth, and in the rush
of pallid light, saw Harney, leaden eyed,
withered to a waxen pallor, smeared
with the blood of the cut wrist which
he feebly moved, struggling back to ex
istence.
CHAPTER XXV,
HAVE YOU COME AT LAST?
Yesterday thlg day's ibadneFs-dld prepare.
â Omar Khayyam.
At 10 o'clock Barron returned to the
Garcia house. His search for Mariposa
in such accustomed haunts as the Mer
cantile Library, the shops on Kearny
street, and Mrs. Willers'. had been fruit
less. Mrs. WHIers was again at the
Trumpet office, where another and more*
important portion of the woman's page
was going to press, but 1-Mim was at
home and told Hairon that neither she
nor her mother hud seen Mariposa since
the lesson of the day before.
In returning to the house he had hopes
of finding her there. From the first his
anxiety had been keen. Now, <is he put
his koy in the lock, it clutched his heart
with a suffocating force. The house was
silent as he entered, and then the sound i
of his step in the hall called the head of
young Mrs. Garcia to the opened door of
the kitchen. Th*? first glimpse of her
face told him Mariposa had not returned.
"Have you got her?" cried the young
woman eagerly. ;
â¢ "No " he answered, his voice sounding
colorless and flat. "I thought she might j
be back here."
Mrs. Garcia shook her head and with- :
drew it. He followed her into the kitch
en, where she arid the senora were sit- !
ting by the stove. A large fire was burn
ing, the room was warm and -bright â the |
trim, nnically neat kitchen of a clean
Chinaman. To the senora's quick phrase
of inquiry the younger woman answered
with a sentence in Spanish., For a mo- .
ment the silence of sick anxiety held the
trio. ,
"Did you go to Mrs. Wlllers*?" said ,
young Mrs. Garcia, trying to speak with
some lightness of tone. ;
"Yes; she's not been there since yester
day. I've been everywhere I could think
of where it was likely she would be. I
couldn't find a trace of her." . Â¦
"Then she's gone to Europe, or is go- i
ing to-morrow, as she told Pierpont. She :
took her money. We looked after you'd â¢
gone, and it wasn't there." .. i
"It'll be too late to find out to-night if
she's gone. The ticket offices are closed. 1
I can't think she's done that â without a 1
word to any one. It's not like her."
The senora here asked what they eald. i
Barron. who spoke Spanish indifferently,
signaled to the young woman to answer i
for him. She did so. the senora listening 1
intently. At the Â»nd of htr daughter-in- !
law's speech she shook her head.
"No. she has not gone," she said slow- 1
ly in Spanish. "She could not take that
Journey. She was not able â she was '
sick."
"Sick, and out on such a night with all Â«
that money!" moaned her daughtcr-in- i
law. !
Barron got up with a smothered ejacu
lation. He knew more than either of the 8
women. The attempt at robbery the night
before had failed. To-night the girl her- ]
self had disappeared. ! What might it all
mean? He was afraid to think. 1
â¢"I'm going out again," he said. "I'll t
be in probably in four or five hours to <
see if. by any chence. she's come back. <
You have everything ready â fires and i
warm clotheiSKand things to eat in case I
bring her with me. The rain's worse than t
ever. Chlng says she had no umbrella." i
Wiihout more conversation he left; the
two women bestirring themselves \ to <
make ready the supper, he had ordered.
At three o'clock he returned again to find 1
the senora sitting- alone, by the ruddy e
stove. Mrs. Garcia, the younger, being j
isleep on the sofa in the boys' room. The t

"If you go to a place on anything
but your own feet you are taken there
too j fast and miss a thousand delicate
joys that were .waiting. for you by. the
wayside." Thus speaks the inimitable
Elizabeth as a foreword Â¦ to her very
diverting "Adventures ; In Rugen." But
even though Elizabeth Is forced by
"the grim monster Conventionality"
to explore the Baltic Island through
the agency of other than her own feet
she sees, as much of the odd and the
beautiful as she would have had sha
platted out: Rugen in ten-foot squares
and examined each /with a reading
glass. Elizabeth has a' way * of seeing
things too fine for the coarser eye,
whether' they be In her own garden at

is [ that Elizabeth has' a sharp : eye for

Its own worth. Attest: The keen" en

Worshipful Sire, Dr. Behr has taken
sly. shots at men and matters in his
club which must have a ready appeal
to the risibilities of all club members.
The nature of his quips and cranks
is not so personal that the uninitiated
cannot- enjoy them, however. : The
humor is rarely broad, always keen and
of the sort which- strikes through ab
surdity and exaggeration.* Dr. Behr was
a student of almost all things know
able. His'fund of knowledge was what
he drew upon In every possible in
stance, bringing surprising oddities out
of scientific deductions, twisting philo
sophical precepts or philological formu
las to suit thÂ« ends of startling mirth.
From the structural peculiarities of the
mosquito as w'ell as from , the sayings
of Socrates the genial wit could find
something to twist into a laugh. "Very
like that of Squibob of the old days,
to whom Dr. Behr pays tribute in an
instance, is the quaint humor. which
livened his speeches. "The Skeleton In
Armor" or the speech upon "Prehis
toric Relics" might have come : from
the lips of : "John Phoenix" himself.
For example, Dr. Behr, discoursing on
botanical classifications, makes this
statement:
"This Ingenious scientist (Pliny) di
vided tht whole vegetable kingdom into
the following classes: Trees, shrubs,
vegetables, chicken salad, mushrooms,
coffee, wines extra. All plants not be
longing to one or the other, of ; these
great classes he lumped together and
called 'weeds,' and â¢_ did not take any
further notice of them." ;-';:

{F there is any fault to.be found with"
Eden Phillpotts' "The "American
Prisoner" it is that there Is too much
of it. The story Is a trifle too long
drawn out to be wholly good; there Is a
considerable amount of dead wood in it
which might be pruned out to advan
tage, leaving a plot unclogged by any
discursiveness. It seems at first read
ing that the author had attempted an
other "Guy Mannering" -and then
thought better of the project, but not
until he had neared the last page of his
manuscript. Another peculiar feature
of Mr. Phillpotts' latest story is that
the American prisoner who is honored
by being the subject of the book's title
"is not the leading character, and. In
fact, does not begin to get Involved In
the main plot of the story until after a
full 200 pages have passed over his
head.
But now, with our mind relieved at
the very outset, we can proceed with
words of well deserved commendation t
for "The American Prisoner." Forsak
ing Africa and Its â¢"childien of the
mist," the author has turned him back
to the country he knows so wellâ the
English west 'country of bleak moor and
wind-swept headland. The rugyedness,
the crude strength of the setting-, in
fuses like characteristics into tha tale,
lending to Its dramatic climaxes some
thing of the eerie and savage which
cannot but grip the reader mightily. In
Lorey Lee, fantastic a character as shÂ«
is, and in Maurice Malherb, with his
devilish fits of temper, the weird spirit
of the downs seems to be * Incarnate.
The Incidents of the escape oftbV pris
oners from Dartmoor prison aiM of thÂ«
spoliation of Lovey Lee's precious
amphora on the marsh at" PostbrldgÂ©
are typical of this stirring note in
; Phillpotts' novel. The plot, sensational
in its elements. Is elevated abovÂ« thÂ«
plane of mere sensationalism by^ths
admirable skill of the author's hand
ling. . .
Maurlc* Malherb. the center flgur*
of thÂ« plot. iÂ« a well outlined char
acttrâ perhaps > the best portraysd of
them all. His . tyranny, which know*
no bounds in timts of stress, his ; im
petuous tenderness, quick to com* as
the bastr .; quality, ; and his Â¦ remarkable
sensitiveness for ; truth Wen in the
most trying make a char
acter at once enigmatic and compelling
of close' study. Whether or riot a man
outside of a book would confess" to the
supposed commission of a murder, with
out stress is not a question to interpose
Itself between .the reader's credulity
and his enjoyment of the .story. The
daughter Grace is in her Â¦ way quite as
forceful a young woman as her father
is a man., When It comes to being Yorn;

"Confession" Is not a good title for
any book of dignity â it savors too much
of the yellow-backed novel with erotio
cover, which is the loathsome spider
of the cheap bookstalls, designed to
catch the silly fly. This "Confessions
of Marguerite" Is not, however, of, tha
spider class, nor yet Is it first-class fic
tion. The story narrates the efforts "of
an attractive young woman, fresh
from the wilds of Wisconsin, to force
an honorable living- out of stony
hearted Chicago. She tries' sten
ography, the stage and. Journalism â
so-called â and finds that the gentle
man with the cloven tail is the only
one who is ready to "offer her the. joys
of life. It would seem that Marguerite
found all men as devouring wolves,
seeking whom they might rend, so she
hied herself back to good old Wis
consin, never to try the city again- The
story touches upon an undoubted ag
gravated evil, but one which cannot be
cured by tho writing of anonymous

things first. Each element stands out
alone, sharply denned. Like Cowper
again In his "Winter Morning's Walk,"
for example, it is not the gleaming
sweep of the horizon, or the spotted
dome of heaven, which , holds, Eliza
beth's attention so closely as the glow-
Ing red cherries of the nightshade and
the "white flame of lilies." With all
this dellcacv. of outline there still
breathes from Elizabeth's pictures a
certain charm of the largeness and
purity of things out of doors, which is
the siren call for the hapless city
dweller and treadmill : slave of the
smoky, sodden life In the mills of men.
Elizabeth's sly humor at the expense
of her fellows is as infectious as the
wine in her word painting. Perhaps
the reader is disappointed when the
painfully forceful Charlotte elbows her
way into Elizabeth's story, but he is
quickly rejoicing again when he be
holds the pudgy mother of the "Six
Bernhards" being made the yielding
target for Elizabeth's quick tierce and
riposte. If ever there. was a character

mit with all frankness that he unaer
took the reading of "Sir Mortimer"
not with a very pleasing grace. He
remembered too vividly those crass im
possibilities in "To Have and to Hold"
and "Prisoners of Hope." The vision 6f
another hero being left broken-leggÂ«d
in a wilderness with savages closing in
with each closing paragraph of tlw
story arose before the wearied fancy oÂ£
the reviewer, freighted with not a little
prejudice. The opening chapters of the
book did not give 'promise of any happy
disillusion to come, but when the tale
gets Into swing after about three chap
ters there is no laving down of the
book.. The reviewer's pride will not
suffer him tx> state that it was his lack
of taste which prevented the~due ap
preciation of "To Have and to Hold"
and "Prisoners of Hope"; on the con
trary he feels that, most logically, his
very strong appreciation of "Sir Mor

art on Miss Johnston's part, expressed
in this her latest book. v ./-.,;
Miss Johnston is never chary of
choosing a large loom for her plot
weaving. The building of a colony, the
waging of a momentous war seem to
impart a very largeness and dignity of
grandeur tp the stories for whose back
ground they serve. Consequently it is
quite natural that the author should
have placed her present tale midst the
tremendously stirring times of Drake
and Hawkins and the lights on the
Spanish Main. Even the dry bones of
history clothe themselves with a glow
ing earment of romance -when" the*
have to recount the tales of the
struggle for a new world and the singe
ing of King Philip's beard by the gen
tlemen buccaneers of old England.
"They were busy men In the van
guard of a quickened age." writes Miss
Johnston In apt characterization of the
Epirit which led her characters to cross
the seas to the new world of wonders,
"and theirs were its ardors, its argus
eyed fancy and potent imagination.
Show them an acorn, and straightway
they saw a forest of oaks; an inch of
rainbow, and the mind grasped the
whole vast arch, zenith reaching, seven
colored, Inclosing far horizons."
Miss Johnston's tale opens with the
farewells to sweethearts and the drink
ing of stirrup cups to the success of
the fleet under Admiral Sir John Nevil,
which was to sail for the Spanish Indies
in quest of Spanish treasure and glory
for the banners of Queen Beth. Of this
fleet is Sir Mortimer Feme, a courtier
now turned ship captain and gentleman
pirate. After taking a rich plate ship in
Carib waters the doughty little English
fleet makes sail for Nueva Cordoba, a
fortified Spanish seaport town, reported
to be tremendously stocked with treas
ure by a renegade English spy who had
been captured in the sea fight With
the adventurers In possession of the
town and laying siege to the fortress,,
the strong spirit of the tale carries
swiftly from one adventure to the other.
Sir Mortimer is captured by the Span
ish Governor and Incarcerated in the
fortress. A determined attack by the
English is pictured by the author with
a strength vibrant with tension. They
are hopelessly repulsed, routed and
forced to fly to their ships, leaving half
their number dead or destined to the
Â«'auto-da-fe" at the hands of their cruel
Spanish . captors. Before the remnant
can leave the fatal spot comes to them
Sir Mortimer, maimed and half-crazed
by the torture to which the had been
6ubjected during his durance in the
fortress. Wild with bodily anguish'and
deep shame. Sir Mortimer tells his"
companions that it was he who, under
torture, had told the Spaniards of the
plan of attack which the English were
to pursue, and that It was he only,
therefore, who. was responsible for the
crushing repulse of his comrades.
It is In the weaving of the' plot
from this on that the author shows
her remarkable handling of the
tragic. Battles and , sieges yield
place to the terrible scourglngs of the
whips of Nemesis upon " this chival
rous gentleman who believes that his
honor is gone and who Is called
traitor by his fellows. Publicly
scorned is he by the Queen, shunned
as pariah by his . erstwhile friends
and utterly unworthy, even in his
own eyes "to- receive the lovÂ« of his
lady, strong even in his disgrace. Sir
Mortimer flies England to retrieve
honor In single adventure against his
enerr-* the Go- r.or of Nueva Cor
doba. How he expiates his sin by
self-imposed sacrifices in the wilder
ness of the New World, how he misses
his vengeance, and how he is finally
cleared of spot or blemish are matters
not to be spoiled for the reader by
a presumptuous reviewer.
One reading "Sir Mortimer" cannot
but recall his boyhood'sâ or girl
hood's â breathless hours, over Kings
ley's "Westward. Ho." In several re
spects the similarity between the two
stories is striking, though this is said
with no hint of plagiarism on the
part of Miss Johnston intended:
Amyas Leigh. Kingsley's hero, falls
Into the hands of the Spaniards while
on a buccaneering expedition; like Sir
Mortimer, he is forced to wander
through the wilderness with his men;

6THAT war should be going on at
any time in any part of the earth
is a great sorrow to right-minded
persons. To be sure, we soon get
used to. the scare headlines and
as the initial shock of armies and
navies gives way to a long series of
alternating reports of victories and de
feats our sensibilities become a little
dulled. But the moment we stop to
reflect on. the enormity. of*Â» war
at this stage of advancing Â¦ ' clvi
lizatio,n. in this year of the Chris
tian era, it rests as a weight upon
our consciences and our hearts. That
great, strong nations should, be flying
at each other's throats, that they
should be bringing together all their
munitions of offense and defense for
the express purpose of maiming bodies,
destroying life, ruining property arid
crippling independent existence seems
terrible. - Besides that, It % seems so
puerile, so irrational, such a sense
less method of settling differences.
And yet it must be said that a single
war is not *a'n Isolated or altogether
Inexplicable phenomenon. It is only
the objectifying on a large and painful
scale of . a spirit which Â¦ runs through
all humanity and which shows how
little removed . we are from the
primeval savage. The war spirit exists
and finds frequent . expression in "V al
most .every nursery, on* every -school'
ground, in almost every mart and ex
change In the land, j See those two lit
tle tots, brother and sister, playing so
happily there on the floor. But a mo r
ment later, comes a shriek, a flood of
tears and a stream . of ; angry, wbrds^
Without any fonrial declaration of war
a state of war exists and perhaps the
entire stake concerns the : possession of
a poor little ; rag 1 doll/ or â¢Â¦ a' top. Â¦ Here
are two ; schoolboys*' suddenly squaring
off and .rushing with clenched; fl3ts at
one another, while the" cry ; of "Fight!

With a crash barely audible in all
that din, the door next to mine burst
open and the second mate flew out
apparently in midair, his trousers half
on, his nightshirt tangled about his
Ehoulders. I think he was- yelling,
but I am not. sure. He. too, lodged
against the table/struggling fiercely to
hold himself. Another sickening
lurch and the cabin whirled; the star
board cabin panels sank while the
port side rose threateningly above us.
The second male and I were hurled
together. â¢ He yelled sorwethlng in my

Relief came. I ; got my head out of
the water and took a long, deep breath,
a delicious gasp. : Slowly the ship right

solid flooring.' The noise diminished;
the .unearthly chorus of shrieks died
away, in the distance. Something bang-
Ing the keel under us shook the entire
vessel, a gentle "lurch andâ she stood
upright. 'Â¦:'Â¦ /Â¦ . : *.v :' Â¦;'.Â¦; .'.'. , :
, Finally, we could . crawl out Into the
cabin. Water; swished .'about the floor
between our feet^ I knew, where the
match' box was nailed fast to the bulk
head. I found a match, struck it- and
with some difficulty lit the cabin lamp.
The \ glass ) chimney was smashed, but
the wick burned a dim, smoky flame.
The two' mates were holding to tho
table as though still uncertain' of their
footing. 'The' door to the - after cabin
opened and the skipper appeared, bleed
ing slightly frpm a cut over one eye.
For a few seconds no one spoke. '.' , â¢
\ ."Well,-" I'll ? be damned," gasped the
second ' mate . at - last, ' smearing , blood
over his face from a cut on his hand. -
"I hope i vou; will be," exploded* thÂ«

Overhead tht ikr wu almost dearf

the water was agitated In short,
choppy waves, licking and rmacfcfng
like a herd of hungry pigs.
Aboard lay heaps of debris eâ¬
smashed boats,* bulwarks, spars, water
casks and ropes. Half the xntssaa rls>

splotched by inky smears of vapor.
Still, as I have said, it was a fine night,
and so warm that all hands lingered
on deck, loath to turn into the stifling
bunks below. The moon, too, low on
the seaward horizon, seemed undecided
about retiring into a vague black
cloudbank on the outward edge. A
long streak of black crossed the satel
lite's red fa.ee like a fantastic mustache.
Its quivering reflection seemed like a
path, along which marched columns of
fiery helmeted troops, jostling and
fctruggling In eager hurry.
"It's a blasted fine night." said the
second rriate, mopping his bare fare
head with a bandana handkerchief,'
"but ye* can't always tell what'll turn
up before morning in these regions."
The mate was hanging limp over the
poop rail, like a wet towel.
"You'd kick anyhow," he growled.
"What you want is to sail under a glass
case." ..
The second mate and I were severely
testing with our combined weight the
strength of a canvas hammock slang
between two stanchions. The ease he

the mate's caustic remark.
"Now, the ordinary lubber." he con
tinued, "would think as how it couldn't
blow about here, but I've sailed the In
dian Ocean quite some, and I ain't so
easy to fool.*'
"No," broke in the mate, "it takes an
extraordinary lubber like you to put the
barometer out of business. Blessed if I
Bee why we need a barometer aboard
with you here. You're as good as \ a
nautical instrument shop, blessed if you
ain't: Reckon rou could take a sight
and figure out a day's work- with an
old soup bone!"
The second mate seemed meditating
for a while, as though striving to com
' pos^e a fitting sarcastic retort/'but evi
dently gave it up as hopeless, venting
his full scorn in the brief remark:
"Aw, fell with ye!"
The air was sultry. A loiv mist cffcpt
out from the shore, bringing a smell of
damp earth, suggestive of a florist's
hothouse. A few lights from the town
twinkled through. The beacon on Skip
pers Island glared at regular intervals,
then dwindled to a mere red speck, like
a sleepy owl winking at us. We who
were aft could hear the men for'd con
versing at lazy intervals in sleepy,
drawling sentences.
Finally the moon seemed to have
made up her mind to dip into the haze
on the black line of the horizon, the
thick atmosphere distorting her blood
red roundness into all sorts of un
moonly shapes. As she began slowly
to be absorbed a light tropical shower
drifted overhead, sending down big
sQft balls of tepid water that struck
our faces like hot tears.
With low, drawling curses the offi
cers arose and stumbled down the
companion way. The -forecastle door
rattled as the men crawled in. Finally
I. too, aroused enough energy to aban
don the deck, leaving it to the drowsy
vJgil of the night watchman in the
donkey-room midships.
I turned in and almost instantly
dropped off Into a black, dreamless
sleep. It seemed but a minute, al
though it must really have been sev
eral* hours, before I suddenly awoke.
A strange, heavy sensation over my
chest sent a chill of fear through me.
From overhead, on deck, came a low
soughing roar, the ehlp trembled, the
beams creaked and some invisible,
power lifted me slightly and pressed
me heavily against the bunk board.
The dimly lighted . cabin outside my
door seemed sinkingâ sinking. From
the pantry came a crash- of- falling
dishes. Another quiver, a lurch and I
felt . myself lifted bodily out of my
bunk, hurled helplessly across my
stateroom through the open door into
the cabin, where the table, fast to the
floor, caught me. The cabin lamp,
burning, and smoking, swung wildly
to and fro,: beating. against the beams..
All around arose a deafening 'uproar
âcrashing timbers, rolling, casks,
splintered glass and, above all, wild
unearthly howls, like a chorus of
. Â£""T" J*Â£ nature of the various oceans

I ence upon the people who live
â¢JL "on the sliores. The cold north

coming fight. Such is, also, the tem
perament cf northern races. But the
sunny equatorial seas, .shimmering in
tro.pical betiuty, are ever uncertain of
temper, treacherous, Quick to Emite
when least expected. A flash of
virtu-, a whirl of destruction, and all
Is over. " Again the waters smile, rip
pliar, and lapping the dead. Beware
of their insidious beauty; beneath the
limpid blue. lurks destruction and
death. ... â¢
. Such Is the Imprecsion gained in five
year* Â»pf sailing over many seas, from
the. icy North Atlantic to the balmy
Bay of Bengal.
The old" wooden bark Don Adolfo was
well known on the Pacific Com-t In
the early days. . "She sailed under Nlc

T^her* I joined her as an apprentice she

tell about. How that old bundle of

AN EASTER
MISSback and Its tendency is to droop front
and back.
Tho 1830 hat is bent down in the
back and is apiked to the coiffure. The
sides upturn slightly and are abun
dantly trimmed with small flowers,
while the front droops decidedly and is
trimmed with lace and mallne.
- One of the most becoming of these
round hats Is built upon a framework
of wire. This Is draped : with, a thin
scarf, upon which there are many lace
medallions and -Insets.. ThÂ« entire
hat is covered with this and a little
border of lace hangs down around the
edge of the brim. The top of the hat
is trimmed with a wreath of small red
roses and at one side there are whlta
wings, which stand forth sharply.
Flowers and wings form the trim
ming for another v*ry pretty hat The
flowers, which are small red roses, arÂ« -
arranged in a wreath, which sur
rounds the straw crown. â¢ Around this
wreath there lies another wreath,
which is made' of little white roses to
set off the red ones. At the aide of th*
hat there stand half & dozÂ«n wlnga.
In red and white.
Feathers and wings arÂ« seen la
every color and the dyed wing is quite
aa numerous as the Â¦' wing of natural
color. Shaded wings, shaded feather*
and shaded breasts - corns In â¢ndlew
color and' variety and some of taeim
are exceedingly pretty.
Straw hats are numerous this yeasy
perhaps more so than in pre^rteva
years; for the . straws com* Â¦ in grtatar
variety and In a greater number â¢Â£
shades and in finer weaves. The Ugmt
weight Oriental straws are lovely, aa4
the very : delicate Imported efftcts are
as charming as one *Â¦â¢â¢ could - desire.
There aro straws that look Ilk* aatlm
and there are straws as thin as a w*b.
Pretty Hata of the Year.
There come certain fancy varieties
of straw with mock pearls In the
weave and there â¢ come straws, wltk
tiny iridescent*;stones that arÂ«. very
brlliant to the eye and that in them
selves, "make a fancy "trimming.
Hats â made of f these straws come
high, but there is this virtue about
them, ;that' they require little trim
ming.
The flower hats are blooming thia
spring and the geranium hats and the
violet hats are In evidence. The gera
nium ...hats are Â¦; in new Â¦ shapes and
very pretty, one of the loveliest beinjp
a boat shaped hat; with sides made of
scarlet- velvet geraniums, while the
top is a mass of green velvet . leaves.
At one side there is. a-; chou of ger
anium : colored; satin * ribbon, while . In
the* midst of the geranium ribbon
there nestle two sharply pointed
wing3.
Another geranium hat 13 in toque
shape, Â»et well back from the face,
with wide upward rolling brim, made
of geraniums. The top is all of green
leaves with a . few large . geranium
flowers trailing at the sides.
Feathers are arranged 'upon many"
of the spring hats in new ways. In
stead of being laid upon ; the hat in
conventional fashion, they are pulled
off at" one side and brought over the
brim'; of the hat and fastened on the
under side. Â¦ ; :
Lonsr ostrich feathers, all exquisitely
shaded, are arranged upon hats In this
manner and Â£re brought over the, brim
and tacked underneath. These feathers,'
which are long, are often in very, deli
cate tones,- thus making a very fine and
handsome trimming for the hat
: Very, few hats are " to be ! worn flat
upon: the head. All hat* are slightly
tilted Â¦ and ; are . worn . either .back from
the'face or â¢; quite; at one Bide,'- though
the day, of the tilted flat, upon its ban
deau is pretty well past* Still the hats
have a tilted look and are made to pro
duce this effect by a Judicious use oj
trimming and br the 'bending, of .tha
brim In. uadulaUng fashion. â¢
and buyers of hata should secure them:
Is the trimming such that it can bs
used again? la there & lace scarf upon
it? Look to see if the scarf is cut up
Â¦o as to be useless next time, or Is it
a folded scarf, which can be taken off
and pressed and used many times? The
corded | lace scarfs, with rope cording,
are the newest; thing. \
Again, If it be a hat. with draped brim
notice: if thi/frlnge, or the lace, or the
needlework which " form* thÂ» i drapery
Is of good quality. 'Unless It is really
good it is a poor Investment The new
est hat drapes are made of lace with
very delicate silver embroidery.
Again, notice If the feathers upon the
hat are long, thick, naturally curling
feathers. There/ are many expensive
hats which are trimmed with short,
stubby 'feathers that are - practically
useless afterward. Avoid such hats and
try to select one with a shaded feather,
of long, thick build, | with a heavy tip \
and a thick rib. Such feathers last
forever and. are well worth the Invest
ment
Metal ornaments are being worn upon
hats this year, and here one can use
a great 'deal of Judgment. There are
handsome rhlnestone buttons, which
look very pretty upon a hat, but which
are really very cheap. But, on the
other hand, there come expensive orna
ments of silver, of turquols*. of gun
metal and of heavily plated gold* which
will wear a very long time and always
look rich.
The. Hat Trimmed With Jets.
Jets make a very handsome hat trim
ming. They wear, a long time and,
though a good Quality of Jet is not
cheap. It is a good investment On* of
the handsomest of spring toques is cov
ered with dangling Jets. It is a round
toque, all laid In many folds, and along
the lines of the folds there is an abun
dance of Jet. , The tiny Jet danglers
look very pretty Indeed. And, to finish
the hat, there are Jet balls at the side,
each ball hanging from , a silky cord.
Three or four balls hang so low as to
almost touch the ear.
The continental hat is being consid
erably worn. This is a hat which Is
large and round and bent with an
effect at military style. There are
large black chiffon hats whlchare bent
In the tri-corner shape, and there are
othlr hats of wire, which are so turned
and twisted as to assume something of
a military shape. But these hats lose
their military resemblance very early-
In their career, for they, are trimmed
with long, sweeping feathers,' and with
bows of silk, and with bunches of chif
fon, thus taking away the resemblance
to the hat of the soldiery. ,
The fad for wearing the very light,
thin felt hat is a feature of spring.
There ; come very soft felts which are
draped with lace and made to do for
traveling- purposes. At the Southern
summer resorts one sees felt hats,
draped with a lace scarf, and made gay
with a velvet rose, and a few green
leaves. These hats will be worn all
'summer. Just as straw hats are worn
all winter.
The dav seems to be past when the
si|mmer hat is good . for summer only.
The wise woman will ' select her mil
linery In I such Â¦ a * manner that It can
be worn" all the year round, and the hat
of August blossoms" prettily in winter,
while the hat of December, looks 'very
.-nice, on Easter J Sunday. V : â¢ . -

try to use old material. They think any

than this waa never made." Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦
Wliat It.Pays to Buy. >, ;p? ;.^ ; .
If you are buying; a hat outright look
at | It very ; . carefully before you pur
chase. It is fi. season of very, expensive Â¦
hats, and while some hats are worth .
their money, others are not , The $20
hats have long plumes or bits .of ex-,
pensive embroidery. . ,, .. v
Â¦_ The woman _who pays j $30 for,- a hat
may; get her, money's , worth, ; and . it " is
likely in buying hat .'at that figure
she is laying out the money, better than
would, be possible, in any other manner.
-Yet $30 seems considerable to pay for
a . hat,' and _ there < are a, great .many,
women ,- who. > have -.never -paid ,- that s
amount But on the other,; hand, there
are $30 , hata { that "are well worth that
sum and that will come back \ one , In
actual value over and. over again.
So In purchasing a. hat this season, if
you are going to get a high-priced one,
look at the following points in the hat
They 'mark- the new: steps \ in 'Â¦- fashion'
"Who ever wears the hats that are
displayed the first of the season?"
asked one woman of another, looking
Into a shop window at a very gay
model in three shades of brown with
wonderful pink roses and a great nest
of creen leaves.
The hat In question was an imported
xrcdel, a Paris hat, one of those hat*
which are brought over as a guide and
from which u great many hats arÂ«
built The, original model is built in
an exaggerated way and Is to be worn
only by some one who can carry It off.
But the hats that are copied after It
are charming.
The very large and the very striking
hats are to be v.orn only by the tall
and the distinguished woman. The
shorter woman must wear a hat # "not
quite so large or so conspicuous, the
medium sized hat, while the little
woman must be content with the little
toque and the tiny "made" hat of Lon
don tendencies.
The cost of the Easter hat this year
runs up to $200. This figure was paid
for a hat by the wife of a Plttsburg
steel magnate. This woman, whose
style is of the abundant type and who
can carry a hat of good size, ordered
a hat of silky straw woven with vel
vet strands. The hat had a curling
brim and a square crown. A few gold
threads lent it dlstinction.
The upper part of. this $200 hat was
faced with the finest of chiffon folds
and over the folds of chiffon there were
laid narrow bands of fine lace inser
tion, about three yards of lace being
used. The roses upon the hat, if one
may believe the milliner, cost at whole-
Bale $9 each. Thev were made of silk
and velvet and were so exquisitely pujt
together that one might easily fancy
them real. They were of the deep rich
shade of red which one associates with
the American Beauty. There was a
large festoon of them, with roses trail
ing over one side of the hat, while the
other side was draped wlth*a feather
which shaded from white to a deep
shade of red.
Getting Up Your Own llat. v
"The woman who wants to get up
her own Easter hat," said a milliner
the other day, "can easily do It If she
will learn to copy. Â¦
"In every millinery establishment,"
said she, "there are copyists, women
who can trim beautifully if they have
a model from which to work. And
these copyists turn out hats that are
miracles of prettiness. It takes a little i
skill to copy, but it is better than de
signing.
"The woman who wants to make her
own hats should- make a tour of the
shops until she sees the hat she ad
mires. Then. she should study its ar
chitecture.
"Her second step should be to. make
a trip to the trimming counter to pur
chase the material for the hat. She
should â¢ get the lace, the flowers, the
ornament, whatever it may be, and the
material used in making the bows.
"Finally, she should secure facings
and linings and any small necessities.
With these in her hand she. may pur
chase a frame and go home and do her
own trimming. Or perhaps she can use
a frame which she may happen to have
at home.
"Women," continued this milliner,
â¢"make a mistake in supposing that It
Is the frame which makes much differ
ence. Almost any old frame can be
bent Into ehape. and almost any old hat
can be taken out of last year's band
box, ripped apart, bent and turned and
twisted and made to look like new
again. .
"The secret of a good hat all lies In.
putting on good, new trimmings. Never
compromise upon your trimmings if
you are an amateur milliner, for In that
way you will ruin your. hat. ..
"The reason so many home milliners
fail," continued this milliner, good-na
turedly enlightening a little party of
amateur hat trimmers, "is Â¦ that they
The Easter parade marks the open--
If.g of the spring fash ion season. And,
1*} its procession, nothing is as gor
â¢pfeems' as the Easter hat, which is pe
culiarly, the innovation of Easter Sun
.dny. The weather may be too cold
â¢.for spring frowns, but no matter how
cold the. .day the Easter hat will ven
ture-forth- . :'; Â¦ . .
â¢ There iÂ« a hue and cry to the effect.
lljat the real Easter hats do not ap
pear on CaJEter Sunday and that peo
ple of good taste leave their best hats
at .home, preferring to come out- on
Easter day with their dull winter Jiead-.,
, pc.tr. .But if tliis be true of a few It
fs also true that a great many do come
. eit- Easter and so Easter Sunday sees
't!i.ma:iy line hats as ever promenading
Fifth avenue.
Easter Sunday, on Fifth avenue is a
wonderful fight. The doorsteps and
the curb are crowded with sightseers,
rtrblle in the center Dame Fashion's
iipvolees parade, proud to show the
"beautiful finery with which an abund
jiyt fortune has rewarded them.
' : The Easter hats this year mark a
a-istinct step In fashion's progress. In
deed., as a milliner declared, they are
u'ulike any hats that have ever been
K^en before. They resemble them
selves, but they do not resemble any
Gjher hats of previous years.
J " "A v;oman who tries to wear last
Benson's hat will look like an antique,"
.^e&ared a fashionable milliner the
.other day. Then, as she balanced an
â¢ 4njffiense picture hat upon her hand,
"she added, "and she will look not only
' very old fashioned, but very old in the
â¢&.ce. for the hats of last year with
their flat tops certainly made a woman
â¢lock twice her age."
i; Hats That Are Youthful.
Â¦ . The hats of this eeason have a de
cidedly youthful effect. They are
.very large as a rule, but though big
iii sJzte, they are not heavy in weight,
."indeed, it is difficult to imagine how
each large hats can be built on so
â¢light a scale
â¢ # ;.Take a hat as large as a .ear wheel,
*. hat which requires both outstretched
Â¦ ernis to go around it. A hat of this
.'â¢"lie will be abundantly trimmed, yet
";trimmed In such a manner that it is
Cot weighed down heavily. A clever
â¢ milliner will so arrange It that it will
â¢cot * weijch more than 'another hat of
: half the eize.
' ...The hats, while larga, do not look
bigi for they are lightly built. Their
2)rfma aje' undulating, their trimmings
consist of feathers and light flowers,
. their brims are draped in muslins,
tulles,, chiffons and xnallnes. and their
entire construction is light instead of
Jjoavy. And this quality makes them
look smaller than they really are. The
picture hat of the season, though big,
does' not look too big. It Is charmingly
'adapted to feminine wear. * Â¦
â¢'â¢â¢It would be a difficult thin* to men
tion the materials, of which the fash
. ibnable rcedium sized hat Is built. Some
of " the- loveliest of hats are made of
straw, with a pretty ehell
fehaped" border. These hats have charm
ingly- shape a crowns, all laid in straw
fbldfe, and they are so abundantly
. woiien land Interwoven with fancy
weaves of straw that they require very
â¢ little trimming. A rose or a feather or
two smart wings are all that is needed.
Ilie woman who buys one of thes*
.fajtcy pretty straws, in tan color or
butter color or pale yellow, will not
.waste her" money. She can place a rose
upon, the hat now. Later, she can re
place the rose with three outstretched
wings. ' And . later In the season she
can take off the wings and replace them
â¢ tilth a few nice autumn leaves.
YVlrat tfye Hats Cost.
â¢ The cost of the Easter hat is a- thing
t>efore which woman shrinks. But,
1 fhrlnk as fshc will, It la an Item which
!*h<! must face. The first hats of the
season are apt to be alarmingly high,
and even though they cost a great deal
. they Â«irc. not always hats of the most
useful order. &W
wearing of the hat well back from the
face ,1a almost universal, and all hats
display the forehead and pompadour.

Decorated ceramics form an accept
able, though very expensive, way of
presenting flowers, but after all Is said
and done, a potted fern in a fern dish
is about as welcome a gift as can bo
found in a long day's Journey, al
though, to be sure, much depends
upon the person sending the Easter
remembrance.

Hampers of Easter lilies will prob

and daintiest of 'i all '; are the ' azaleas,
which -are : imported : from Holland in

blossoms and come in al colors, so that
they may be sent out in; Dutch wooden
baskets, mlxed> with : smllax or ferns,

Blossoms fsxe;^another; favorite and
certainly they to. be, ;for they
are the daintiest of , the dainty. -In long
or short; branches;: one' may getithem,
heavijy ' laden ' .with ; the rosy : tinted
petals.," but unless they are handled Just
so they^are^ very; apt to look nungalnly
and as though they resented being torn
from ; the tree. )Â¦'Â£>. coarse Indian basket
Is a good ; setUng f or , them," for, they are
great drinkers and fade and die If they
are not 'well cared for. A common tin
velous vases are a fit gift. One of the
prettiest designs Is a large pond Illy
resting on a huge leaf of mirror glass.
Such a vase, filled with lilies, affords
the opportunity for presenting an artis
tic piece of bric-a-brac as well as the
flowers, and. In this way getting ahead
of the stern mamma, for while a cost
ly gift might be bundled unceremoni
ously home again, flowers and their re
ceptacle could not be returned without
positively Insulting the giver.
Carnations lend themselves beauti
fully to any scheme that the florist
may fancy and on: account of their
beauty and fragrance are a formidable
enemy of the rose. A Japanese basket,
almost like a vase In shape, may be
filled with them and a dull, moss
covered foliage is used as a new back
ground. Of course, miladl cannot very
well wear them,, but she may take but
as many as she pleases, and put the
basket in her favorite corner to enjoy
at her leisure.
The price of the carnation brings
them within the means of the average
person, and as a , consequence tha
Easter girl will receive them by. tho
bushel In . beautiful hampers of brush,
the new material for baskets. Gen
erally they are arranged carelessly and
the lid is raised partially or entirely,
showing the flowers, which look as
though they were oh the .verge of fail
ing out, but In reality they are caught
and held firmly In f place by wire "pins,
to the sides as well as to the. top. One
need have no fear about sending these
hampers a long distance, for they, are
set In blr ; baskets, which all florists
use for sending out such trophies, and
they ; reach their ,. destination without
being in' the- least disarranged or
bruised. Frequently, but Just as one
fragrant white petals will fall on the
singers until all have passed out.
No church decoration would be com
plete on Easter without the Easter
lily, the pure white chalices of which
carry their message of the resurrec
tion. The same church will have an
immense arch over the altar, \ which
will be composed entirely of great
white lilies and Southern sxnilax. The
arch will be of such a helghjt as not
to interfere with the shower of apple
blossoms. At the rear of tha church,
over the organ balcony, apple blos
soms will be cascaded with Southern
smilax, and extend i down the side of
the balcony to the pillar in a shower
of bloom.
One of the ,. New York churchea,
noted for Its richness of decoration at
Easter time, will use nothing but lilies,
crimson amber roses and paLos for
decoration. There will be a gradu
ated row of arches, made of lilies and
ferns, from the entrance to - the' altar
down the center aisle. Am the wor
shiper enters the church, the vista
Â¦ of . the aisle will appear telescoplo. On
the gate of each pew a cluster of lilies
and palm leaves will be attached with
pure white ribbon.
The shower over the chancel will be
made canopy shape, of Easter llllea,
ferns and smilax. The ropes of smllax
will ; be cauzht to â¢ the side walls and
over the balcony. On each side of the
altar will be what > appears to be , a
cross ' made of crimson . rambler roses,
but which Is a rose tree itself, arrow-*

But from the few churches that are

about the edge as a frill. Fasten a
bow of the violet ribbon at each side
and tie a loose bow on the under side.
Then turn the hat upside down and
fill it generously with the fragrant flow
ers and plenty of leaves, for they add
a pretty touch of green that can be ob
tained in no other way.
Another clever idea is to give a gar
den hat, no matter how oil or how
broken it may be, a generous coat of
gilding or silvering, and then turn back
the corners to form a square. Fasten
the corners with loops of ribbon or
cords, or even grasses, and fill with
flowers of all colors and descriptions,
wild flowers if they are to be had, for
they are a vivid reminder c * the coun

Of all the bevy of girls not one has
been forgotten, even to the very re
ligious one, for an Imitation prayer
book has been chosen as a suitable gift
for her. The book, when It is opened,
contains some white or lavender flower
appropriate for the day, which, by the
way, does not prevent the case being
used later as a receptacle for the prayer
book itself. Imitation books, with titles
on the backs from popular authors, arÂ«
another novelty, and they are not only
pretty but a trifle that pleases the book
worm mightily.
Sentimental Johnnie has discovered a
brand new wrinkle that has tickled his
very soul, for the blissful day has come
when he may with all propriety send
his best ever an imitation photograph
album and one side Is reserved for a
picture of the donor. Certainly no one
could object to such a pretty bit of at
tention, and for once In his life Johnnie
Is blissfully happy. Of course, such
notions are always almost certain to
be carried out In a more expensive
way, for the Idea Is too pretty to be
discarded In hot haste. The girl who
wants to please her betrothed may
tuck a miniature of herself In the flow
ers and give him the pleasure of nnding
it. or she may send any other article
of value that especially pleases her
fancy.
Not only are baskets made of vari

work baskets have been appropriated
by the up-to-date florist for azaleas,
snowdrops and baby roses, and as the
baskets come In all sorts of oriental

they are always pretty. â¢Particularly
so when they are made of a moss
green wood* plentifully sprinkled with
flitters to resemble snow, and tied with
ribbons of six or seven contrasting
colors.

the other wants something more fetch

' 1904 girl has progressed in such a fash
ion that she is best pleased when her
; pct flower is artistically placed in an
intricately woven basket of pussy wil
lows or arranged in one of the multi
tude <;f charming and fantastical ways
that^ have come into such vogue.
The -California girl may love the
orchid, but It is not the flower that
hoMs the olace of honor in her heart,
apd. very few of the 800.000 that are
needed in New York to supply the Eas
tt?r Gemand will be needed here.
â¢' Eut -.orchids, when they are sent, are
jStfch.e^Quisjte blossoms that they need

â¢ $Â»eeÂ«ls*"a handsome frame to comple*e
it, '"for. if the/setting of either is net
h*ahnÂ«nious. and artistic much of thÂ«
â¢Tjeauty is lost.
JPatkfiSM the most popular way tc
fend .orchids to" the Easter girl is to
nutss them in baskets made of young
pusj#. -willows. These pretty little
things, have been forced in hothouses

riety, "und. all manner of odd shapes
: are bo'ing woven, which, by the way.
ie' dctte. <i*uite as sytematically as any,
other method of. basketry.
' Â« A . particularly tit one Is what is
knOwn. as the nest basket. The pussy
willows* are woven round and round
like a nest, with the pussy heads
saucily protruding here and there, to

glass -recferitacle, and when it ia filled
c witÂ£ "the magnificent blossoms, with
he.re â¢ arid there a petal straying over
[ lÂ«iÂ« nest-, it is a floral fancy that would
please" the most fastidious and exacting
. girl on earth.
. Anoiher fav'crite style of basket is
the c*e that is shaped like a diamond,
o wkh four handles meeting In the cen
Â°tÂ«r. Covering the glass In the bottom
are*- masses of violets, and resting
serenely on their sweet bed are orchids,
tumbUr/gr -about .In artistic confusion.
Â°JTo give the prettiest effect some of the.
"blossoms should be attached to the
<fcfi.nC.ljes-. for they are very graceful and
lovely and fall naturally and easily

Nothing could be daintier or more In
contrast than delicate tints of the
orchid*, the rich shades of the violets
and the" dark framework of the basket.
â¢ â¢ Another charming conceit Is a large
jChlnese- straw plaque. The flowers,
anything in the deep yellows, are fas
â¢tened firmly on one side and then per
dlt'ted 4.o droop In any ! fashion that
th^y please, but the stems are con
cealed by a great bow of yellow and
laVender ribbon that stretches across
the plaque and ends In another great

Â»*o prettily with the straw color and
â¢the touch of green finishes It off with

The sweet-smellmg violet Is always
certain of favor for the Easter girl.

ar c e always dainty: Corsage bouquets,,

tne. beginning of an epoch in railroad
freighting which may result in the abo
' â¢Fition of thousands of smaller and
Veaker engines of this and other coun
tries. â¢;
They are the product of a theory that
* one gigantic locomotive, having the
* DQwer;"of two of the present average
" -type, can be operated, more cheaply
1 -than two small ones.
The ten locomotives will be able to
pull 60.000 tons of dead weight on a
level grade. If the first-class armored
e'teel battleships Vermont, Connecticut,
Kansas and Ohio were placed on
â¢wheels on a level track it is safe to say
That they could be pulled across the
continent by the ten locomotives. A
.Bering of flfteep or twenty of the ordl

.required to pull "a similar weight.

Six of the engines are of the standard

Owing to the fact that Russian loco

thought by many railroad men that a
large order for locomotives may at any
time be placed with an American plant
by the Russian Government.
pointed out some time since, the Vio
torlous in the Channel and the Vener
able in the Mediterranean fleets have
both been specially fitted up with me
chanical and electrical apparatus for
experiment by these committees, who,
I understand, are subsequently to hold
Joint meetings for the purpose of com
paring notes, when further tests and
experiments will be made \ to dear up
any points of doubt or conflicting evi
dence. The main question Is, of course,
to give the maximum amount of pro
tection to a system which is the least
likely to break down by other means
than being cut by the fire of the
enemy. This is naturally very hard to
obtain, for both electrical and mechani
cal .arrangements are peculiarly liable
to get short circuited or out of gear.

Itself ; and I ; am Informed; experiment
is being made with encouraging results
in ' this ; manner of delivering and re-
road, and their cost will probably be
at least a third more, than that of the
best frelght.englne now on the road.
From the time the first cast was
made until the first shipments shall
start over the rails for the Southwest
fifty days will have elapsed. A force of
about 1S.O0Q men assist in the construc
tion of these engines, the thousands of
pieces of iron and steel being directly
handled by at least half that number.
Although of the same width of the
smaller engines and adapted to the
same tracks, the new type . is much
longer and higher than the others, and
when placed beside one of the old style
locomotives the latter appears a pygmy
indeed. The most distinguishing fea
tures beside the size are tandem cylin
ders and the immense driving wheels.
Before leaving the Baldwin shops the
ten great locomotives will probably be
Inspected by representatives of several
of the Eastern railroads. Â«
The other forty locomotives will be of
the balanced compound type, similar in
many respects to the French engines.
The .drivers will be seventy-nine Inches
in diameter, and the cylinders fifteen
'and twenty-five inches, with a twenty
six-inch piston stroke. They are de
signed to attain a speed of eighty miles
an hour and will be used exclusively
for passenger trains. Each will weigh
about 320.000 pounds, Including the
tender. Shipment of these will begin
April, and the last. will leave the shops
in May.
While work on these engines is rap
idly progressing a rush order for twelve
locomotives from- the Japanese Govern
ment Is being -pushed with all the ex

SOME NEW AND TIMELY COURT DECISIONS
"Y N all the history of the Inception
\ 'â¢' arid progress of the present Russo
Â¦â¢"J -Japanese war there Is nothing Â»o
interesting or so fascinating to the
frank, 'outspoken American mind as
the. subtle intrigue, the plot and coun
terplot, and the far-reaching net of sly
diplomacy that has just begun to drib
bleVut from both sides. It is the sort
â¢of covert game that democratic Amer
ica does not fully comprehend, hence
t.he dragnetting of libraries and book
stores for anything that will throw
even a side light upon the subject.
As a particular example in point, the
:woria is Just beginning to realize that
tne assassination of the Queen of Korea
& vaj' back in 1SS5 has a distinct bear
ing Upon the present trouble â indeed,
was part" arid parcel of the long and
tenacious intrigue that has culminated
â¢In the war of to-day.
"This far-reaching plot and the in
tense American interest therein is
In a review written by George
Hainlin Fitch, the book reviewer, in the
Sunday Chronicle. He says:
â¢ "Tb.e strong public interest in any
book that gives information about the
Far East has Induced Little, Brown &
Co. of Boston to issue a new illus
trated edition of "The Queen of Quel
parte," that striking romance of Rus
sian intrigue in Korea by Archer But
ler Hulbert, which was recently pub
lished.
"The romance turns on the ambitious
plans of Russia to secure possession of
Port Arthur and of the intrigues which
led to success in wresting the fortress
from the victorious Japanese. Colonel
Ivan Oranoff is the central figure oZ
the romance, and much of the action
turns on the state funeral of the mur
dered Queen.
"It would spoil the reader's enjoy
ment to give a glimpse of the plot, but
it may be eaid that it contains some
remarkably dramatic episodes, In
which a young American plays a con
spicuous part. There is a framework
of fact u:*on which the story is built,
and this framework the young author
obtained at Heoul while he was serv
ing as cor.-espondent for several Amer
ican newspapers.
"He shows that Russia secretly in
cited the uprising against the. Korean
monarchy that led to the death of the
Queen in order to gain a hold on the
kingdom. Then she used that virtual
mastery of Korea to transfer, the coun
try to Japan as a sop* for the' seizure
of Port Arthur.
"One of the most vivid features of
the book is the superstition- of the Ko
reans, which permit* the hero to con
duct a state funeral without a corpse.
The story is intensely' interesting, and,
in addition, it gives a good picture of
Korea and the Koreans."
As pointed out by Mr. Fitch, the au
thor of "Queen of Quelparte" has built
his novel upon a foundation of truth
and historical fact, which is the reason
that it is now enjoying such a wide cir
culation.
These are actual facts, for, although
the name of Quelparte, an island prov-
ince of Korea in the Yellow Sea, is
used, in the title of this story, the de
scriptions, customs and most of the
legends are distinctly Korean, and the
setting of the romance is entirely true
to those ' wild days in Korea In the
winter of 1897-98 when Russia accom
plished Its bloodless conquest of the
country, and temporarily withdrew in
the following springâ according to com
mon report to pacify Japanâ soon after
Russia's lease of Port^ Arthur from
China was made known.
Despite the large degree of fiction
in the narrative it is doubtful whether
there is more fiction than fact. The
Queen of Korea was murdered In her
palace at Seoul October 5, 1895, in the
belief that she was playing into the
hands of Russia. The palace was fired,
and only a fragment of her body fe
malned to be carried In the imperial
funeral, which occurred in November,
1897. The details of the events In tns
chapters "The Imperial "Funeral" and
"The Signal of the Scabbard" are de
rived largely from the author's letters
to American papers written from Ko
rea at that time.
But there is something more vital
here than certain descriptions and in
cidents, and that is the; spirit of Rus
sian intrigue and Russian aggression.
The thread of the love drama is. of
course, a fiction cf the author's, which
all will recognize, but the record of
Russian methods cf Intrigue in the
East, of her Infinite scorn of truth,
of the depths of her deceit, of the
intense liveliness of that old dream of
Peter the Great, of Russia's purposes
in acquiring possession of Korea ami
of the reason for her throwing it away
again is essentially true.
The will of Peter the Great, referred
to in chapter II, Is kept in the secret
archives of the Russian Government
with vigilant care and religious rever
ence. It is inscribed: "The Secret Plan
of European Supremacy left by Peter
the Great to his Successors on the Rus
sian Throne."
It is because of this value of timeli
ness, as well as for its historical truth,
quite apart from its absorbing interest
as a tale of love and adventure, 1n
which, too, it has been freely declared
there is more truth than the author
cares to confess, that the Sunday Call
has secured thi3 excellent novel for
publication, complete in four editions,
beginning next Sunday, April 10.
As is pointed out by reviewers ail
across the continent. It is a book not
only replete with adventures and ten
der passages, but it gives the best ac
count of the long series of hidden dra
matic Incidents that led up to and cul
minated In* the present war and of the
intimate customs and beliefs of the Rus
sians, Koreans. Chinese and Jap.incv' 1
that has ever been written about the
Orient. It Is even more fascinating and
reliable than the histories* themselves.
For that reason, beginning next Sun
day, It will be a valuable addition to
the long line of timely and high-class
novels that the Sunday Call, following
its advanced literary policy, has been
giving to its readers.

At a corner of St. Mark's Church in
Venice, the one nearest the Ducal pal
ace, there "has been standing since the
eleventh century a pillar of red por
phyry, carved with the portraitures
of four noble gentlemen of Albania.
In fact, they were brothers who went
to Venice ia a ship laden with vast
wealth- One couple plotted against
the other to secure all the treaaure
and at a feast each duo of plotters
poisoned the other. The signory of
Venice seized upon their goods. In
commemoration of so trnbrotherly a
conspiracy and as a warning against
avarice the uniQue and exquisitely
carved pillar was erected.

Japanese and Korean showmen, in

acrobats, display a. truly marvelous
skill In teaching animals tricks. They
rot only exhibit educated bears, span

trained birds, and, what is the most
astonishing of alL trick fish. One of
the most curious exanjnles of patient
training is an exhibit by an old Korean
boatman of a dozen drilled tortoises.

He lets an automobile run over him!
Some ordinary citizens â none too wiH
insly. It is true â have done the same
thing, though in a slightly different
way. But this big. b!ue-eyeii giant does
it every evening in. the week, to say
nothing of two matinees. It is a most
uncanny thin? to watch. The map calls
himsalf Lionel Strongfart.
The automobile is large. It may be

and, of course, with a machine of that'
color on the stage the act goes all the
better. When the curtain rises the
auto is discovered standing at one side
of the stage, its fcrewaeeis at the lower
end of a sharply inclined plans of
planking that. leads to a stout wooden
bridge. The further end of the bridg3
rests on a similar inclined plane of

stands peering up the wooden "Inclina

set in sockets of polished brass, gleam
hungril>. .From the throat of the thing
come growlings, mntterings, great
sighs, that begin in a sputter and end
in fierce, crashing barks. That's the
way the strong man describes it. Then
he goes on to say in his own modest
way:
The giant puts hims^f on a!! four?,
back downward, under the . Â»tout
wooden bridge. His body is supported
by arms and legs, his chest. ter.3e and
inflated to its utmost capacity, sup

He is ready. He give3 the signal by
nodding his curl7 blonde head.
The chauffeur pel's the levsr an<i the
hot monster rushes uz> the Incline,
gro-srling. barking, its passengers a lit
tle pale and clinging apprehensively to
their places.
Now the big red c-r has come out
on the bridge. It i3 still running up-
Tsrard as it approaches the giant's
chest. That chest, studied at close
range and calmly, looks as if it muse
crack under the awful weight of more
than 2009 pounds. The knotted ana
and gnarled Ieg3 of the giant are quiv
ering under the strain. The contor
tions of his writhing countenance arÂ»
awful to see.
On^on goes the machine. 0..
It rolls over the man's chest, passes
off the bridge, down the other incline
and so off the stage. The giant slowly
brings- hicrseif to an upright slouchQy,
breathing hard, hia head down, as If

THE SCRAP BOOK PAGE
13Along the sacred road of Nlkko, In
Japan. Is an Idol about which centers
one of the most curious worships in
the world. Upon the surface of the
statue are seen little pieces of what
appear to be dried paper. If you stand
by the idol for a while and valt for the
worshipers to come along you will see
what these bits of paper are. The
devotee halts In ? front of the image,
then scribbles a prayer on a. bit of tha
paper. The wad he then chews up
into a ball and hurls at the god. If it
hits the face and sticks the prayer Is
sure to be granted and the pious pil
grim goes away happy. If the ball
sticks to some portion of the body the
omen is not quite so propitious, and if
It falls to the ground there Is abso
lutely no hope.
Such a mode of prayer Is even more
curious than the praying wheels.. of the
Buddhists, who set .the wheel revolv
ing and reel off, prayers by machinery.

There is no denying that many
women obtain divorces simply in the
hope of legalizing a liaison that is ao
insult and an offense in the sight of
God and man. yet there are many good
and true women to whom the divorce
court is the vestibule of heaven. Where
it is otherwise it needs no evidence.
A hasty marriage tells the whole story.
The woman who has suffered longs to
be free and the first breath of. freedom
is too sweet to be lost again In the
uncertainties of a new venture. She
must have time to cool off, to forget
the sorrow and humiliation of her life,
and later should a new love come. It
Is heaven-sent and a blessing that
comes in the nature of a reward.
But to expect a mother to lead the
vanguard of ostracism against her own
daughter is to insult her womanhood.
Whether she be innocent or guilty let
the mother treat her In such a man

her kindly.
Then came the question of gambling
and of bridge whist.

fascinates nine out of ten women. Big

name of charity, are Bomewhat de
moralizing. Women will make woeful
exhibitions of themselves in their
eagerness to secure a 10-cent prize
when they could buy a freight load of
such trash and never miss the cost.
There Is something revolting In the
Idea of Inviting one's friends to play
cards for money, and that refined
women bo far forget themselves is
amazing. The domestic upheavals that
have disrupted families in consequence
r.re Incalculable, and the woman who
becomes an enthusiast will pawn her
Jewels, obligate her husband and bring
ruin on herself to gratify the craze,

A pretty notion that has been a de
lightful windfall to the bride of this
year is the so-called "shower." Instead
of giving luncheons It is quite fit to Is
sue cards for an informal dance, a din

the difference lies is Just here â at the
bottom of the invitation the words
"Linen shower for Miss Smith" con
veys the idea in a very delicate fashion
that all. whether they put In an ap
pearance or not, are expected to con
tribute a piece of linen, or to be exact,
whatever chances to be designated â for
instance, a table cloth, half a dozen
napkins, towels or even tea towels not
only come under the head of linen, but
are useful and very acceptable as well.
By the time one is happily over and
the collection stowed away in the
treasure box, another friend sends out
cards for a "crystal shower" and the'
merry work Is kept up through brass,
tin, books and like until the bride-to

Thursday in commemoration of the
Lord's Eupuer. Friday of his crucifix
ion and Saturday the Easter celebra-'
tion really begins. In many parts of
Europe, especially In Russia, and dur
ing tie middle ages, services were held
all night before Easter until cockcrow,
which is the hour at which the resur
rection is supposed to have taken place.
The devout remained for hours in pray
er until morning, when they at once
saluted each other with the. salutation,
"Christ Is risen," to which the answer'
was, "Yes, he Is truly risen!" That
form of salutation is still the one in
Russia .Easter morn. In continental
Europe, however, and in Great Britain
the church began the celebration cf
Easter at the mass of the previous day.
or Saturday, and the bells on the
churches, which had been silent sines
Thursday, were again runs during tha
service.
At the Saturday service, too, tn tha
Catholic churches a large candle Is -
blessed,' and also the new fire to recall
the resurrection of Christ, the candlÂ»
forming a conspicuous object. In tha

son^ Is of course one of great rejoic
ing after the fasts of Lent and for
merly was celebrated with a number
of festivities which, according to our
modern Ideas, are hardly connected
â¢with an ecclesiastical- anant. Thus in
France It was customary - to - play a
game of balL In which the participants
were Bishops, Canons and other church
dignitaries. There were dances in
.France as late as the seventeenth eÂ«n
â¢tnry and bother signs of Joy and hap
piness. The law courts were all dosed
and business seems to have beea gener
ally ; suspended. :In .England .-Easter
has been celebrated as a Christian fes
tival since 669, and. although; the Puri-.
tans abolished it, as they did Christ-.
'"mas : and other church celebrations. It
has beea revived and /given- much of
its ancient splendor. -In this, country
all the churches observe |t with special
music, and the .fair; seÂ«; make_ it the
special occasion- forr appearing with .
.their latest novelties - in bonnets, * an
indication coming down from t*xLy
times tiat Â¦prinr Is at hand.
At the time of the adoption of the
Gregorian calendar it waÂ« debated
whether the feast of Esster should be
given a' fixed date or left movable as
before, and the decision was finally
reached' in favor of the latter plan, as
cbnfermin? to the ancient custom of
the church. Easter therefore is al
ways the srst Sunday alter the full
moon which happen* upon or next
alter the 21bt of March (the equinox).
THE name Easter is of Saxon ori
gin, being derived from that of
the Goddess Estera, in whose
aotor sacrifices and celebrations
took place at the opening cf
spring. With the advent of Christian
ity these hecthen ceremonies were dis
continued, but as they had occurred at
the time cf the year when the resur
rection Â«f Christ was celebrated by the
church the old name was applied to the
new festival. With the Latin races,
"hou-ever, the crucifixion and resurrec
tion of Christ havi-g occurred at the
time cf the Jewish passover, they have
called* the festival by a name suggest
ing that fact, thus the French name
for Eaeter is Paques and the Spanish
Pascva^
. As with all the other great festival!
â¢cf-the. church, the date when Easter
should be celebrated has been the causa
of bitter controversy. The Eastern
-tThurcli Insisted that It should bÂ« cele
brated on the day of the month on
."which' the event commemorated oc
curred, and as the crucifixion ii sap
pcse3 to have taken place on the four
teenth of Nisan, the first Jewish month
or Passover, on that date It was com
memorated, and the resurrection two
days later, en the rixteenth, regardless
cf whether those dates came on Friday
and- Sunday or net.
. The. Western church entirely discard
ed the day of the month la arranging
for the celebration and Insisted that the
crucifixion should always be commemo
rated en a Friday and the resurrection
on ar Sunday. The. matter finally came
up. for adjustment before the Council
'of Nictea. in 325, vihich decided in fa
vor of the Western contention, but the
Eastern church refused to change its
custom .*r.d thus gave rise to what is
known as the "quartodeciman heresy."
unless the full moon occur on Sunday,
when Easter is the following Sunday.
It aiust be remembered, however, that
it is not the actual moon in the heav
ens nor even the mean moon of the
astronomers that regulates the time
of Easter, but -an altogether imagin
ary moon, whose periods are so con
trived tha* the new (calendar) moon
always follows the real new moon
sometimes by two or even three days).
The effect of this is that the 14th of
the calendar moon, which had from
the times of Moses been considered
full mÂ«m for ecclesiastical purposes,
generally fell on the 15th or 16th of the
real moon and thus after the real full
moon, which is generally on the 14th
cr 15th of the month. With this ex-
planation then of what Is meant by
the full moon, namely, that it Is the
14th of the calendar moon, the rule'
is that Easter day is always the first
Sunday after the Pascal full moon,
which happens upon or next after the
21st of March, and if the full moon
happens on a Sunday, then Easter is
the Sunday following. One , object of
this arrangement was that Easter and
the Jewish Passover should not coin
cide, but they did last year and will
again in 1923 and 1927 and in 1931.
Easter is always between March 22
and April 25. The last time Easter
came on March 22 was in 1818 and
it will not occur that early again in
this century.
It may prove interesting to those who
are mathematically inclined to figure
out when Easter will occur in any
given year In this century- If. so, here
is a rule thev can follow: First, di
vide the date of the year by 13 and
call the remainder a; divide the date
of the year by 4 and" call the remainder
b, then" divide the 'date, of the year by
7 and call the remainder c ' Second,
divide 19a plus 24 by 30 and call the
remainder d. Third, divide 2b plus 4c
plus 6d plus 1 5 by 7 and call the re
mainder e; then Easter "will- be the 22d
plus d plus' e of March; or the d plus
e minus 9 of April. There are two ex
ceptions to that rule: If April falls un-
der the calculation on April 26, put it
back to the 5 19th^ of "that month, and
when It falls orij April .25, 'put it back
to the ISth' unless d equal 29 and e
eqftal 5. / 'J . -
. With the substitution of Easter for
the old festival "of the Goddess Estera
all the old customs of the Saxona were
not abandoned, but, on the contrary,
were preserved and Christianized. Thus
the custom! of giving eggs, - many of
them beautifully colored, to friends at
Easter was kept up and the eggs were
blessed' by the church. From the ear
liest ages the egg has been considered
as a ': symbol [of the beginning of life
and therefore .w-as {a very
appropriate" present \ : at j: the 1 beginning
of spring, when all life is budding out
and beginning anew. The custom of
"picking eggs," that is to say, of strik
ing their, points 'together, which Is a
favored amusement with boys in the
Eastern States, though rarely seen on
this coast, is -also; probably of very
ancient origin, and was probably prac
ticed by. the , ancestors of oar Juvenile
Americans of to-day centuries ago. In
"Washington Easter Monday is the
great children's. day' of, the year. On
that day thousands of children con

Text: Romans, viii: 11: "If the spirit of him that
raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth.In you. he that
raised up Christ JeÂ«?us from the dead, shall give life 'also,
io your "mortal todies through his spirit that dwelleth
In you."
THS cress is the central fact of human history. The
resurrection *is the divine seal upon the truth for
which the cross. stands. \ For a man to foretell his
ov/n return to life after death is the "extreme of
absurdity and to accomplish the fact is a human
impossibility. Therefore if JÂ«sus Christ did live after
death it is- inccntestible evidence of his divinity and. of
the supreme authority of his teachings
I. The procf of the resurrection. This proof happily
does not rest on Christian evidence alone. It Is furnished
by the enemies of Christ in large degree. While -the
Scripture says positively that he did die. yet this state
ment is confirmed by* the action of the soldiers in charge
of the crucifixion, who forbore to break the legs of Jesus
because he was* already dead. The centurion in
mand of the soldiers in hi3 official report to Pilate stated
that Jesus wns dead. Medical testimony is unanimous
conc*rnin?r the fatal character of the snear thrust.. which
reached the heart itself."* Joseph, with his hundred
weight of spices and the closely applied linen bandages,
would have destroved' any remaining life in the body of
the Lord as surely as the present day methods of em
balmment.
Even his enemies, the Jews, never denied the death of
Jesus. Thanks to , them, we are certain of his death.
This being established, we turn to the proof of his sub
sequent life. We search for his body and we find no
adequate explanation of Its disappearance besides that
given in the Scripture. His friends could not h*v
stolen it. owing to the precautions of the guard and the
seal set bv his enemies at the tomb. The Jews did not
take it. or they would have been glad to producait to
confute the tale of his resurrecttcr..
We have the tasUmcny- of the apostles, who for forty.
*lays after the resurrection were 'his companions. ;Â¦ They
saw him. they ate and ;dmnksv. r ith him. they walked and
talked with him. Th.'if testimony is consistent and thÂ°y
gave their lives in niartyrdom. in- witness of? their sin
cerity.
More than thbC within" fifty days of the*. resurrection,
in the very spot where it occurred.", the disclole3 made
it the centra! theme of their preaching, using it to con-;
firm and seal the truth of their teaching. They, spoke
to thousands who knew the circumstances of the death
and burial cf Jesus. They had every opportunity to in
vestigate tha truth cf the apostles' statements. Their
conviction of the resurrection was so positive that 3000_
believed cr.d were baptized. These were soon followed
by 2000 more, oiaking 5000 contemporaries of the
events, who acted \\pon their belief in the resurrection-
The first epistle to the Corinthians is of undisputed
authority and records that Jesus was seen alive after
his death by 500 at one time. No event in history is so
well attested as the death and subsequent life of Jesus
Christ. \- 5 '"./Â¦ Â¦Â¦-' i
Why, then, do men not believe? Because to ; admit
this supreme miracle Is to admit alL And to admit the;
truth of Jesus* teaching is to change the life to conform t
thereto, Men are not ready to do this and therefore
have denied the facts. The resurrection has been, the "
theme of endless contention in the hope that the un
righteous lives of men might be justified.
II. The pledge of the resurrection. Since God has :
raised men from the dead and since Jesus has himself
returned from the dead, we are certain that he has power
to raise his followers. We therefore believe the promise
in the text that he will raise those who believe in him.
This is a gospel of complete salvation, a renewed spirit,
a quickened bofy, a reunion into an individual life for
eternity. Here is a divine pledge of the eternal exist
ence ol the soul in a glorified body. .
We are not, however, to consider the body] immortal
because the soul is. The condition upon which an Im
mortal tody is the heavenly possession of the believer
Is the indwelling spirit of God in this present life. If,
our present bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit
and if our lives are lived according to his loving guid
ance we are assured of an immortal life in the glorified
body. The precise character of this body we do not
know. Sufficient to state that it shall be free from the^
temptations of earth and a fitting habitation for a puri
fied soul.

what a great and important discovery
the action ot this small, boy, led to* for
Â¦without' the * telescope we would aavÂ«
learned ? very little ; about ; the stars or
the sun or the moon. '
IF an old story be true the curiosity
of a little boy led to the Invention
of the telescope, that remarkable
glass which reveals the wonders of
the heavens to our eyes. I suppose we
all know that Galileo first constructed .
and used a telescope for scientific pur
poses, but some one else first conceived
'the Idea, of one- Now, here is* a story
Â¦which I have beard and which I think
interesting, enough to tell you.
. Many years, ago there lived In far
a war Holland an optician. He had
three children, all of whom loved to
play about and , watch him as he sat
at his bench working. His little boy
especially thought it great fun to look
through the grlajses his father used in .
his work- Many wf them had such <xid
shapes and often as he held .them tip
.to the sun be could make lovely rain-,
Jbows on the floor and walls. It chanced 1
-one memorable day -that he had taken â¢
tw# glasses and. standing In the street â¢
just outside the shop, he held â¢ both . to .
his eyes a.t the same time. All at one*
it ;Â¦ seemed that the , face of the; great ."
clock,- which; be{ knew to be . several v
flocks away, was right before him. For
a moment he was frightened, How had
the clock come*. so- near, he wondered?
He winked hls'eye very hard and look
ed Ei it without the glasses. There; It
was Ih ' Its ' ufenaJ- place, '. co far - away
that he could scarcely see its hands!
'â¢But it was â¢ near," be eaid to him- '

A Boy's Curiosity
C"T> HERE was & strong smell ol
I , burning- rubber in St. Ursula's
I School for Girls.
I "What Is It?" asked MiÂ»i
Fanthorne. the principal. '
"What can it be?" echoed MlsÂ»
Zfuns, the teacher of drawing:.
The family of dolls that lived in
the upper dormitory knew what it
was. James R, the rubber doll, was
'being burned at the stake. He stood
bolt upright in the wash basin, prop
ped' there by pieces of wood, to one
of which he was securely tied. The
basin was heaped with Ipaper. which
burned fitfully. From time to time
.Mifdred Alice, the Lord Hiffh Execu
tloneer, encouraged the flames with
fresh paper.
. " "He'll blaze away for dear life,
presently," she said, cheerfully. ;'and
trhen he does the sorrowing friends
Biust shriek terribly."
The sorrowing friends were repre
sented by Mary Marcella. the doll's
rftlstress. who, attired in the cook's
bjack shawl and crape draped bonnet.
" borrowed by Mildred Alice for the oc
casion, looked mournfully on at thÂ»
fÂ»d spectacle. Real tears stood in her
ipyes, for she felt for James R.
-Little Dearborn, who had
â¢ t,he next room to Mary Marcella, and
who loved the dolls as much as th*lr
mistress, also looked mournfully on;
. t .""Tou can sell his ashes to the sor
rowing friends after he is all burned
up;, that is half the fun," Mildred
Alice encouraged her.
"J3ut I don't want his ashes; I want
him!" declared Mary Marcella, ob
stinately.
â¢ ; Mildred Alice paid r.o heed to this
remonstrance. She was the only girl
lji a large family, and at home with
her brothers her dolls had been doom
ed- to lives of unceasing adventure.- In
such tragedies as burning at
the stake were an everyday occur
rence. When she had come to the
school several days before Mary Jlar
"cella and Jennie were pleased that the
new girl showed an interest in the
dolls and had eagerly accepted her
.offcf to show them how she and her
brothers played dolls at home.
. "Tou know they always burned per
â¢nns at the stake in the histories,"
"she said, "and especially the royal
persons, so let us begin with James R.
tie sounds nice and kingly. Next we
can take Mary Queen of Scots, or,*'
and "she cast a dark glance at Miss
F,a.nchbn. the beautiful French doll,
"we might behead the Princess Lam
balle."
Miss Fanchon turned iier dazzling
glances away -from the martyred
James R and bestowed them on the
Indian doll, the Toung Brave of the
Wabash.
"And. oh!" said Mildred Alice, en
thusiastically, "we can scalp the
Young Brave; that would be fun."
The Young Brave said nothing, but
it \vas noticed that he did not respond
to Miss Fanchon's bewitchments. He
seemed to be thinking deeply.
James R burned very slowly. "He
Is only smoldering a little at the
toes/' complained Mildred Alice. She
heaped the paper around him and
ligrhtad it again so that it broke into a
brilliant blaze.
"Now! shrieks of sorrowing
friends,** cried Mildred Alice, excited-
Mary Marcf Jla tried to shriek, but
her tongue clove to the roof' of her
mouth.
"Friends, I call upon you to avenge
my death," pronounced Mildred Alice,
in & sepulchral voice. She was about
' to continue the speech of the dying
man, which she gave, in proxy, when
the door opened suddenly. There
.stood Miss Fanthorne, the principal.
â¢ "Oh," explained Mildred Alice,
blandly, "we are burning James R at
' the stake. His ashes are to be dis
tributed' presently."
But Miss Fanthorne had not wait
ed for an explanation. She picked up
James R by his head and doused him
In the water pitcher.
; "Qv to your room," she said stern
ly to the late lord high executioner.
.'.'All three of you will report to your
class teacher for extra lesson punish
ment."
"Mary Marcella and Jennie did not
care. They would gladly have saved
James R at a much greater cost than
ihis.
" "And what might have happened. if
.the. frightful holocaust had not been
discovered you and I cannot contem
plate without a Ehudder," said Miss
Fanchon to the Young Brave of the
Wabash, when the dolls were talking
it over that nixrht.

MAXY-TTTLES BUT XO FUNDS.
The cynical Labouchere once .sug
gested that a law should be passed au
thorizing Impecunious peers to dispose
of their superfluous titles at auction
L or _ by private sale. At present the
only way they can treat their titles as
financial - assets is by becoming: * com
pany directorsâ which is getting to be
a very risky businessâ or by marrying
American ' heiresses. And because, , if
they were allowed to sell some, of
their titles outright for cash, there
would be fewer transoceanic peer
esses. It has been- urged that
such a measure would undoubtedly be
popular-with England's feminine aris
tocracy, who view with jealousv and
alarm the extent to which they are
being ordered out of their limited

on this side of the water that the ex
ploits of the supposedly plutocratic
Bernard McGroary â who returned to
Ireland from New Jersey a few, months
ago and who died at Liverpool recently
âattracted no end of attention and a
good - deal is likely to be made ' of a
lawsuit which I understand is coming
as a sequel to his history. McGroary,
of , course, was the "eccentric . Irish-
American millionaire" who, after," turn
ing up In ; Donegal. - his eld home, took
up his abode at the poorhouse and who
lived there - for some Â¦ time in style be
fitting as opulent a person as be pre
tended lobe. Not long after his death
it came out that McGroary was not a
millionaire at all. but possessed of only
about SSOOO. This, he'' bequeathed, for
the most part, to relatives In the United
States, and now I learn that his kins
men on this side of the water are going
to. contest, the. will. It is possible also
to tell Â¦ here, for the first time, â¢ why it
was that McGroary elected to. take up
his - residence - In so unlikely a retreat
for a rich man as the: Donegal poor
house.
It seems that when the Irish-Ameri
can ; arrived .In Donegal, preceded by
tales of the fortune he had amassed in
the new, El Dorado, his poor , relations
were overjoyed at the prospect of hav
ing a real live millionaire as a kins
man. The family tree : was quickly
built up and relationships hitherto un
heard -of "were as^qulckly established.
.The .neighbors came to congratulate
the McGroarys on their good fortune
and Bernard himself became the ob
ject . of . an admiring * and patronizing
, community of humble* :Donegal folk. A
millionaire does not descend on Done
gal every day. so that McGrcary was
feted Â¦{ and regaled by every one who
could by : any stretch of imagination

The old Duchess was a great friend
of Queen Victoria, and from' lS43--to
1848 was bedchamber wornan-to her
Majesty. In 1S61 she became Mis
tress of the Robes, holding that office
until IS 6 S. and filling it~ again in 1574.
After the death of the Queen the King
presented her with one of his mother's
bracelets, which the old lady prizes
highly as a souvenir of her royal mis
tress. On the death of her husband in
1SS4, she took up her residence at
Bearhill Park, WaIton-on r Tnames,
where she still lives, having long ago
withdrawn from the social whirl.
Evelyn. Duchess of "Wellington. â¢ is
the youngest daughter of the late Col
onel Thomas Peers Williams; of Tem
ple House. Buckinghamshire, and is
still a very pretty woman. . She mar
ried the third Duke in 1SE2 and has
been a widow less than four years. She
is a devout Catholic and has never
taken a prominent part In social func
tions, sharing her husband's fondness
for the Quiet and innocuous pleasures
of a country life. This third Duke. In
physiognomy and tastes, bore very lit
tle resemblance to the martial found
er of the house. He looked so much
like Spurgeon, the famous preacher,
who was anything but a handsome
man. that that name was bestowed on
him as a nickname.
FOND.VESS FOR CLAY PIGS.
The favorite hobbies of this Duchess
are animal pets, and china and clay
pigs, of which she has a large collec

the Continent with her late huband.
Whence comes this predilection for
porcine effigies no pne knows, but It
is a very harmless taste and one In
which her Grace is not apt to en
counter any rivalry and arouse jealous
heart-burnings. Despite her devotion
to it she found time to compile a cat

LONDON. April 3.â One of the most
perplexing raix-ups in all the tangled
list cf the British peerage is the fact
that there are at this time three liv
ing Duchesses of Wellington. The
rune is so famous and the great
2adies who bear it are so little known
in America â or nere either, for that
matter â that I have taken advantage
cf a rare opportunity to get thÂ» pho
tographs of these three titled dames
and some information about them
which proves to be of much human
Interest.
They are known as Elizabeth.
Duchess of Wellington, the widow of
the second Duke of Wellington; Eve
lyn. Duchess of Wellington, the widow
of the third Duke of Wellington, and
the Duchess of Wellington, wife of the
fourth and present Duke.
Neither of the two first named can
rightly be termed Dowager Duchesses,
for neither of them retired in favor
erf a son's wife. The present Duchess
of Wellington is already a grand
mother, the child of one her daugh
ters, who married a commoner. Mr.
Janes, having been christened on Feb
ruary 1 of this year, by permission of
the King, at the Chapel Royal. St.
James Palace. London. Yet the lady
who preceded her in the title Is still
voury enough to enter the matrimo
nial lists again and is engaged to be
married to Colonel Wellesley.
The key to the puzzle is found in
this Queer bit of genealogical history:
The first and great Duke of Welling
ton â and thus far the only great Duke
cf Wellington â who died In 1S52, was
succeeded by the eldest of his two
eons. Arthur Richard Wellesley. who
Â¦ as born In 1S07 and died in 1SS4 with
out issue.
He vas succeeded by his nephew,
Henry, the second son of the Iron
Duke's second son, Charles, who died
in 1S5S; Henry, the third Duke, who
bom in 18<6, died in 1900. also
v ithout children, and was succeeded
by his brother Arthur, born in 1849,
who then became the fourth Duke of
P"-?12i:_gton.
\nd tb.es It comes about that there
â¢ three living Duchesses of Wel
gton.
HISTORY OF THE DUCHESSES.
. Elizabeth. Duchess of Wellington.
Â« idov cf the second Duke, is a state
ly dame, whose head le crowned with
â¢.he snows of nearly eighty-four win
ters. At the time of her marriage,
which occurred In 1S39, she was Lady
Elisabeth Hay. daughter of the Mar
quis of Tweed" dale. She was only 19
then. & very pretty girl and of
a sprightly temperament, which found
vent Jn some amusing pranks. When,
U a bride, she was taken to Strath
fieldsaye House. Berkshire, the coun
try seat of the Iron Duke, for the
' honeymoon, Â«he rather shocked her
hiisbar.d by decorating the hlrtbric
collection of marble bests and statues
to her private income by selling motor
cars on commission which, may. en
able her to pay. her dressmaking bills
without unduly taxing her husband's
purse.' -
Kathleen Emily Bulkeley Williams
was the maiden name of the reigning
Duchess, who is many years older than
the lady whom she displaced in the
occupancy of the ducal estates. Her
father was Captain Robert Williams,
A. D. C, son of "Sir Robert Williams,
Bart. Her predecessor's maiden sur
name was, also Williams, but the two
families are not related.
! She married the fourth Duke in
Â¦
1S72 and has. a family of four sons
and two daughters, so that there is
now little likelihood that the title will
soon rass , to collateral branches cf
the family. Her eldest son. Lord
Douro, was a victim some little tinie
back of a severe "ragging," as "haz-'
Ing" Js here termed, in the Guards.
For some reason, perhaps because he
was too keen in his profession, he was
unpopular with his aristocratic asso
ciates, who nicknamed him "Do-go."
The present Duke and Duchess of
Wellington do not play a conspicuous
part in society. The reason is that the
Duke is hard up â for a Duke.- By the
terms of the bountiful money grant
which a grateful country bestowed on
the Iron Duke it extended only to
three generations. Besides, being un
der the painful necessity of making
both ends meet without any aid from
this fund, the poor Duke has become
further impoverished by having to pay
jointures out of the estate to the two
senior Duchesses." With a large and
extensive family to support, so severe
ly have they felt the need of retrench
ment that they have closed up their
country seat. Strathfieldsaye House,
and are trying to let it. Here is an
excellent chance, by the way, for some
American millionaire who would like
to take his ease for A a few seasons in
the favorite country residence of Eng
land's greatest soldier.

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL; SUNDAY. APRIL '3, 1904
ECHOES FROM THE
LODGE ROOM
18"Anna Held's manager, Florenz
Ziegteld Jr., has staged this produc
tion gloriously and with an eye to
artistic detail." which lifts it out of the
usual rut of those musical plays
Â¦which, while produced regardless of
expense, are ! for the most part so
many yards and yards of gorgeous
costumes and- bedizened clothes. No
more artistic setting could be Sciagiiied
than that of the first scene. Then
follows a moonlight scene by the lake
at the Chateau de Cotnplegne, the In
terior of the Grand Opera-house in
Paris, with the opera ball in progress,
a glade in the wood at Dauphlne and
a final magnificent tableau, showing
Napoleon's .-. ._ entrance into Paris.
Richepin's scenario, upon which Jo
seph W. Herbert has embroidered this
charming book, is to the effect that
there was once a great man in France
named Napoleon. '[ He fell in love with
Mile. Mars, a beautiful and virtuous
actress", . but : when his _ Minister,
Fouche, brought the t young- woman
before him she pleaded so eloquently
for the 1 pardon of her fiance, an of
ficer of the guard, that â¢ Napoleon : not
only- pardoned . him. but made the
young, man sit on a garden bench be
side him while : Mile. Mars recited i for
their sole benefit the legend of The
Lion and the Mouse." -
"Tjcched by : his kindness and gal
lantry, the~ actress "was Â¦ always loyal
to him .during ;the year " of his banish
ment -and was the j first : to Jwave Â» his
emblem : In the faces of his enemies on
the Jeve"; d f his ; return to Paris. w From
this scenario j Mr. 4 . Herbert has made a
play which, while" it possesses charm-
"llam'selle Napoleon," the new
piece in which Anna Held will be seen
here at the Columbia on Monday.
April 4. is one of the most artistic
productions of its kind that any na
tive composer and librettist has turned
out. A wen known writer has the fol

You had a very able critic on your paper
at that timeâ -Mr. Barnes."
I bowed gladly for Mr. Barnes.
"There was another on the Post,"
the actor recalled.
He smacked his lips naively over the
one joke of the Interviev that fol
lowed. It was toothsome enough, how
ever. "The Post man said of me," he
smiled. " *Mr. Byron dies in the first
act â 'tis well!* I shall never forget
that.' He was an awfully nice fellow,
too. Knew him welL Perhaps that
was why he said it."
Mr. Byron told me then that Mary
Mannering was the fairest actress he
had ever played with; that she is only
anxious for ail the people fn her com
pany to get their due prominence;
that stars are by no means atf like
this, and so onâ you've heard it be

in San Francisco," he decided then.
in the Byronic make-up. True, he had
glimmered but for a pale month. Fur
ther, was the actor not a nephew of
Ada Rehan. a son of Oliver Doud By
ron and Hattie Russell, and accepted
by the press as himself an - excellent
actor? The fault must be mine. I had
not found his subject. The duty of the
interviewer is to discover the possess
ing interest of the Interviewed. What
could Mr. Byron's be? Perhaps Shakes
peare? Somehow I did not think it
could be Ibsen. Perhaps, as Â¦with Mr.
W. H. Crane, it might be sev?n-up! It

Without any particular enthusiasm,
however, Mr. Byron told me hf>w he
originally was J?oing to be a doctor.
"In fact I took the preliminary exam
inations for Yale. But the head mas
ter told? nay people that I was intended
to be an actor. He. practically de
cided the affair, In fact- But all my

cerity and seriousness as well.
"There are long scenes in 'Mam'selle
Napoleon* which are legitimate com- *
edy, almost drama at times, and the
delightful way in which Miss Held
played the role of Mile. Mars was ; a
revelation.
"To say that it was the best per
formance Miss Held has ever given
conveys no idea of the artistic charm
of her work. Dainty, feminine and de
mure, shfc played without a trace of
the cocotte."
Joseph Herbert plays a low comedy
part very cleverly; Arthur Laurence
makes an' excellent Napoleon: Henry
Bergman a capital Fouche, while little
Franz Ebert. the IiHiputian, is delight
fully droll as the callboy at the Come
die Francalse.
With all these good qualities en
hanced by so superb a setting- "Mam'
selle Napoleon" becomes an attraction
of the first class. It lifts native musi
cal comedy out of the ruck.

land? Ma+cr Andre Is, cf course, locked
upon here as a spy."
"You thi=Jt the play itself good?"
"Most assuredly. I think Clyde Fitch
in fcia way the biggest man in the
country," the actor testified. "He wrote
both 'Major Andre' and 'Her Own Way*
last season, and 'Her Own "Way* is un
questionably one of the successes of, the
year. And it has been an awful season
in New York, ril tell you," and then
Mr. Byrcn told ne. In the same neat
way in which his grease paints were
lined nz> at hf3 right, just what was
the matter with the American drazna.
Seme cf us have thought it was the
plays, some have thought it was a
brute public, some have thought it was
the decadence of the player. It turns
out. however, that iris none of these.
""What is the matter with the play3
to-day," the actor decided, "is the lack
cf stage direction. The stage manager
has net the power that ought to be
vested in his hands. This will illustrate
what I mean: I played once in a. drama
that the author staged. He collaborated
with ns all throughout the rehearsals.
Every point was mada exactly as it
was intended, with the result of a per
fect production. Then the author went
away. No more supervision. "What
happened? I suppose actors are weak,
and we drifted into careless ways. A
gesture would be interpolated here, and
somebody would put an 'Ah' there, and
so en until the whole thing got blurred."
""Where was your stage manager?"
. -Ah, that's it. He had not the power
in his hands to prevent the thing hap
pening. Suppose, now," Mr. Byron be
came earnest here, decorously slapping
the trunk at his side for emphasis,
"that the play had been in Richard
Mansfield's hands, for example. That
kind of thing could not occur' with
Mansfield, because he is always there
himself to Inck after every comer of
the performance."
"Is this caricaturing that you speak
of always in the nature of overdoing â
elaborating?" I Inquired.
Where the health of the A.merican
drama is concerned one cannot be too
curious!
The aÂ«*tor insisted, with a little smack
of the lips, that he is prone to where
his pÂ«?t theory is concerned: "Always.
We don't leave things out. It is never
omission. The effect, again, is some
thing like that of putting in
extra notes in a piece of music.
You know what that means. And
point after point Is lost by persons
hanging "n to a laugh, putting in an
'ah'.' that is not In the score, raising
hands that should be still. Look after
thes* 1 things and the drama would be
a different proposition from what it is
now."
"The virtue of an 'ah!' " I murmured,
then queried, doubtfully: "Do you
think, Jlr. Byron, that the endowed
theater would help the national
drama?"
Mr. Byron thought it might. He
further said that Mr. Carnegie had ex
pressed himself against the endowed
theater the other day. Also I was In
formed that this step on Carnegie's
part had called forth various opinions
from varioaa actors. And then Mr.
Byron had to go honeymooning with
Harriet. "He seized and donned a very
negligee sort of beltâ considering the
rest of himâ before going, with the
explanation: "Excuse me; thi3 Is not
a piece of apparel, you know. It is just
to get a laugh." He went to get It.
I had been blaming the brilliant per
sonality and parts of Mrs. Flake for the
unexpected apparent flatness of the
Byron country. Yet evidently that waa
not It. And yet, there was that clever
Hungarian, seemingly with both sturdy
brains and heart at his back. . Then
a^ain some one had since sensed a star
It -was the Arthur Byroa of "The
"Â¦Â£tubborr.hes3 of Geraldine" that ap
'" tailed to me, net the niocey-gnxnbin*

tfsmed fcr a brief day in stardom this
last season and I wondered why the
brevity. So, and therefore, I went to
ask all about it.

afeout it.
..-Orderly as a barracks was the ship
shape room in which we found our
selves. The actor, till, trim, erect.
stood at attention. He had already
"donned the impeccable summer garb
of th* first act cf "Harriet's Honey
mocn." In fact, there was a general
ready-for-the-fray air about things, ta
.me, who like to wander into the ty
wars and crossroads of chat, a little
disquieting. We seated ourselves af
trr a ChesterSeldian gre*:!:^ in an
â¢^fjuilat.era.1 triangle. Mr. Byron where

of any organization that comes to

grand opera.
"The Beggar Student," MiGoecker's
charming, comic opera, will follow and
the Ttvoleans are giving their best to

promises to be of sumptuous sort.
I heard that piquant little -person,
Dora de Fniippe. the Tivoli's new
soprano^ for the first tiyie the other
night, along wiih "Mr. Pickwick." OnÂ«
wonders, to begin with, where the small
lady r>uts all the voice that she brins3
into play. "Miss de FiKIppe i3 a dis
tinct acquisition to the Tivoli forces.
She not only sings welL but acts in
graceful and sprightly fashion. Qnt
nctes particularly her pretty hand play,
possibly a little obvious at times, but
always piquantly aprop*?s. Miss de
Fniippe has a useful niece in the ad
mirable company the Tivoli now owns,
and has already found a warm wel
come among its patrons.
"Mr. Pickwick* also introduces an
other Tivoli graduat- in Esther King,
who has made a highly promising de
but as Polly . Miss King has a valuable
voice, round mezzo soprano in quality
and of good range, she sings with
considerable style and feeling and
shows evidence . of careful training.
The young woman is fortunate also in
beins: more than commonly pretty and
has a modest and pleasing personality.
The closing number of th*Â» programme.
Saint-Saens* piano quartet in B Cat.
introduced the pianist of the organiza
tion. Miss Frances Rock. Quite why
Miss Rock should have been chosen I
cannot decide. It is true she i3 there on
time, has a vigorous technique and
powerful tone. But the latter i3 hard
and unbeautiful and the pianist is
largely wanting- in genuine ensemble
sympathy. "Without the judgment of
Mrs. Oscar Mansfeldt. who wisely cages
the excessive siano values with the lid
of the instrument. Miss Rock dom
inated tfee quartet to the extent of dis
torting its whole dynamic scheme.
That, however, is a mistake made by
much greater pianists than Miss Rock.
The Greig sonata as given by Sig
mund Bee! and Fanny BloomSeld Zei3
fcr was colossally funny in this direc
tion. I have heard Miss Rock in sub
stantial solo work, not very musical,
but solid and sincere, and it would be
wiser fcr her to confine herself to this
medium.
"Among those present.** as our so
crety editor says, was that old hero,
Wenzel Kcpta, come to pay hi3 respect3
to his confreres of the rival quartet
from a bed In the hospital!
As a whole, perhaps, the performance
was ratter nervous and sketchy, trac
its many effective moments demon
strated the inherent ensemble virtues
of the quartet. The Bazzini string
quartet in D minor opened the pro
gramme, the Mozartean flavor of the
work, very nicely in evidence ia its ren
dering. Finish, of coarse, was Laekin,.
but there was style, fervor and
sympathy in the handling of the
charming' composition. Quite at its
best was the quartet in the Dvorak
Lento, -with its iangorouaiy graceful
movement. Mr. Trainer's viola did
excellent service here and the whole
reading and treatment were fun of
musicianry feeling. The Raff "Sehr
Lustig. moeglich Rasch~ (D minor
quartet, op-. 77> fared not so well at
the hands of the. players. Its . merry
steeplechasing was o'erxnuch for the
new association. Mr. Weiss, astride
hi3 'cello, was later over the fences
than the leader, and all showed a dis
position to "gang their ain gait.â¢ But
that, of course, is a matter of rehear
sals.
The new Minetti string- quartet made
It3 debut last week at Lyric Hall with
considerable success. Its constitution
this year is unusually fortunate. Mr.
MInetti's confreres feeing Edward Lada
at the second violin, Charles Trainor at
the viola and Arthur Weiss as "cellist.
For Mr. Trainer's viola one is in par
ticular grateful." Time and arvin dur
ing the concert one was compelled trÂ»
pleasurable recognition of his fine toaÂ«
and intelligent phrase. Mr. Weiss, too.
is always capable, and Mr. Lada prov
ed himself a commendable second ttÂ»
Mr. Minetti. The leader's own violin,
by the way, waa in somewhat scratchy
temper.

Mrs. Charles H. Mentz held the last
of her pleasant "at homes" last Friday
afternoon at her home on Washington
street. - The hall and rooms oh the lower
â¢ Easter is universally recognized as
tile day of redemption for the Chris
tian world, but it really has acquired a
distinctive meaning during the last
Â¦ fen' hundred years â it has come to
mean the redemption of the bachelor,
JiRewjse his feminine prototype, from
the desert wastes of lovelcssness.
If you doubt it, a chit with that
Â« zar of lovers, tlvc license man, will
tell you that at this season of the year
he does a land office business â and if
you are on good terms with him, he'll
tell you a few more interesting things
about the intrepid ones who have de
termined with fine courage to launch
forth in little barks built for two.
They come from various conditions
of life, with varying impelling^: some
for love and some for lucre, some for
nothing in particular but a desire for
shelter, and some women for the mere
novelty of bearing the title of madame
before their nomenclature.
Of all these the most interesting are
the weddings prompted by the loves
of man anrl maid â and the most al
luring those of the blest children of
prosperous parents.
Here are the gems of the highest
jt\motion of man set with the allure
ments of brave trapping. What is a
prettier scene than a lovely maid,
white-robed and veiled even as - the
.mist, treading the cloistered aisle on
the arm of the chosen one, foTJowed
by Jier maids and matrons and all the
â¢gay array of bridal folk? What, in
" deed! And prettier still, if in her eye
a bright tear glitters .while her rosy
lips are sweetly smiling.
# When â when has the smart set suf
fered bucIi inroads into its ranks as
it has in the past quarter? There's
pretty Mirs Anna Mae Burdge. who is
to wed Bernard Pacheco Miller; Miss
Eleanor Eckart, who will become the
bride of Hugh Hume on the morrow;
Mis>s Helen Bailey, who has promised
her hand to a handsome Gothamfte;"
Miss Florence Harris, who on the 6th
' will become Mrs. Ernest Stent; and
. Miss Ethel Kent, who will wed Lieu
â¢ tenant Gilbert Allen, U. S.A.
Now, that doesn't by any means ex
haust the calendar of pretty Easter
brides of the smart set, and the page
isn't big enough to hold even an agate
roster of them." But here's u> them
that's here, and to them that's not.
'May they all be the same rapturous
iovers at next Eastertide, yes, and the
next, for. know ye, blessed children,
that divorce isn't so pretty a thing as
it used to be before the gospel ox

IRKUTSK, April 2.â Use of the rail
road across Lake Baikal has ceased Jn
consequence of . the breaking ,up of : the
ice. Its assistance to. the Government
In the transportation of â¢ supplies has
been incalculable. As- an indication . of
â¢its it Is said that between
March 2 j and March 28 there passed
over It 1682 freight cars, .673 troop cars,
twenty-five passenger*coaches carrying
officers and sixty-five locomotives. The
cost of the Ice road was $250,000. Men
are now tearing up the. track. ' '
The speech of the Viceroy of India,
Lord Curzon of Kedleston, on March
30, ; at Calcutta, when he reviewed the
last . five years of Indian administra
tion and referred to the Government's
watchful policy, attracts more atten
tion than Colonel Macdonald's victory
in Tibet. It was considered to have
been especially inopportune Just at a
time when English baiting In Russia
is decreasing, as it -tends to revive
animosity; but, coming from Lord Cur
zon, . the words carry less weight per
haps than they would from other quar
ters, as he is looked upon as having
his own special, policy for India, as
Cecil Rhodes had for South Africa.
The Bourse Gazette . In an editorial
entitled "A Voice From India" says:
"All of Lord Curzon's speeches have
the .fundamental idea of the shadow
ef Russia^ on . the Indian frontier. Lord
Ourzon says, 'We do not want Tibet,
but no other country shall have It."
Lord Dufferin said the same thing
about Nepaul, Burmah, and Kashmir.
British arms have already . carried
death ; into Tibet, which is part of the
Chinese empire. The purpose is to take
Tibet and run a railroad through China,
In -order, to better, place troops 'there
quickly/ We wc-hder how France, .in
view of the projected Anglo-French en-
though perhaps less poetic, means thaa
depicted In the papers. For example,
take the case of armored trains. We
discussed the ' subject and decided
against them. The conditions did not
call for them. The line runs through
territory held by our troops. There may
be a few robber bands, but there are
no Japanese, at least. The only things
of . the kind Introduced are - armored
cabs for the engine drivers to protect
them from stray bullets. There will be
no difficulty over the Impending stop
page of the ice railroad across Lake
Baikal. The lake generally is free from
ice about the middle of May, but long
before that "time the ice-breakers will
have cut a channel and ferries will be
running regularly.
"Now that the lea railroad has ac
complished Its mission I will tell you
the secret of its origin. It never was
intended to convey men. but only roll
ing stock, engines and rails for tho
Manchurian line. This it has success
fully achieved."

there must be unity in the Democratic
ranks in New York State and that they
must have # definite assurances that
Tammany â¢ is a sincere party to the
Parker deal before they would go Into
It. The Southern and Western Demo
crats are willing to take either Parker
or Gorman. They would take anybody
to shut out Hearst. But they, would
lend hearty support to either Parker or
Gorman if either one j could get the
united backing of the New York De
mocracy. Belmont was* told in:, the

Parker was a greater favorite at this
time among the Southern and Western
Democrats than Gorman,, and that it
would probably be easier to rally dele

' WASHINGTON. April 2. â Elihu
Root for Governor of New York is
one more tip given out Â«by Empire
State Republicans. .. It came to-day
when Mr. Root paid his second visit
within two weeks to the White House
and had luncheon and dinner with the
President. Mr. Root came ostensibly
to consult with Secretary of War Taft
and General Chaffee, chief of staff,
on the location of permanent camp
sites for army maneuvers.
When Mr. Root left the War De
partment he said he was going to de
vote all of his time to the practice of
law and would keep out of politics,
but v a short time after his retirement
he made a speech In New York In de
fense of the administration, which at
tracted attention all over the coun
try. He followed this with a speech at
a Republican club, in which he severe
ly rebuked the Odell and Platt fac
tions for quarreling over who should
be "boss" when the fortune of the Re
publican party was at stake.
Mr. Root has been practically Presi
dent Roosevelt's representative in the
conferences in New York which have
resulted in Governor Odell and Sena
tor Plat ceasing their fight and It is
now believed he is too deep in the po
litical game to withdraw. It is also
argued that he has gone so far in
advising Republicans as to their duty
that should they call on him to run for
Governor he could not well refuse.

the official estimate would seem to
imply. .On- most of the transports
horses were taken also, or supplies of
one sort or another, so that no effort
was made to take all the men they
could carry. The Japanese' did not
attempt to fit bunks for their soldiers,
as we do. Each man sleeps on a mat
two and a half feet wide by five feet
eight inches long, which he lays down
on the deck; On these transports the
men - slept on the upper deck and
horses were carried on the main and
lower .decks and in the hold. Each
horse had a stall two feet six by six

What' the Japanese Intend to make
their, main objective is at present pure
speculation,' and one man's gueas is
just as good as another's. So far noth
ing has appeared to make anything
clear. ," The main road in Korea leads
directly from . Pingyang to Wi ju, on
the, Yalu River.^ J Beyond ;that it bears
away ' up ' through " the mountains. ' by
way- of Fengwangcheng toward. Muk
den. The Japanese are already in
force at Pingyarig> It seems to be -the
expectation here that . the Second
Qorps; j now going forward,' will go. to
Korea* also. If that turns out to be' the
fact it .will ' indicate that they â¢; proba
blyIntend to push upjthe great road
toward .Mukden; That- will mean .'a
big fight somewhere about Fengwang
cheng.^ The country Is very moun
tajnous andthe road execrable. It is
so" bad that it has been explicitly said
atthe War Ofllce that the army would
riot, .undertake" to V employ â¢wheeled
transportation of any . sort.' -But -that
implies that 'they' .will - endeavor ; to
get along without field guns, and It Is
safe : to ;say ; that any ' attempt to drive
the, Russians out - of their strong p'osi^
tions with, only the assistance; of

TOKIO, April 2.â The Navy Depart
ment has no information concerning
an attack on Port Arthur by Vice Ad
miral Togo, reported to have taken
place during the night of March 30-31,
and it expresses doubt that another
general attack has occurred. In this
connection a naval officer said it was
possible that a few Japanese cruisers
were in the vicinity of Port Arthur
and that there may have been an ex
change of shots, but he was certain
that the main Japanese fleet had not
been engaged.
Doubts Rumor of Battle.
General Allen was recently stopped
by the Japanese authorities at Plng
j-ang, with the request that he go no
nearer the Japanese outposts, and the
correspondent of the London Dally Mail
at Seoul reported two days ago that
the Japanese had requested General
Allen to return from Pingyang to
Seoul until such time as they could
provide fitting accommodation at the
front for the military attaches. Gen
eral Allen is chief of the Philippine con

NEWCHWANG, April 2.â The au

aVoused to-day by the arrival of a press
b6at indiscreetly bearing two Japanese
servants, who were arrested and prob
ably will not be released for several
m,onths. On account of the fact that
the Russians have not yet arranged
the local .status of correspondents such
indiscretions are apt to be interpreted
as indicating co-operation with inter
ests inimical to Russia and to inspire
an erroneous conception of war corre
spondents in the minds of the Russian
authorities. The entire crew and staff

The Twelfth Division has its head
quarters at Kokura. It is composed
of the Twelfth Brigade, headquarters
at Kokura, and the Twenty-fourth,
headquarters at Kurame. The Twelfth
Brigade consists * of the Fourteenth
and Forty-seventh infantry, from Ko
kura, and the Twenty-fourth Brigade
of the Twenty-fourth Infantry, from
Fukuoka, and the Forty-eighth In
fantry, from Kurame. Lieutenant
Each brigade consists of two regi
ments of infantry and for each divi
sion there is a regiment each of cav
alry and artillery, with a N battalion of
engineers and a train, or transport
battalion. The guards are all station
ed In Toklo in peace times, although
their Infantry is recruited from all
over the empire. _The cavalry
and artillery are recruited from
the Tokio district. The brigades and
regiments of the Japanese army are
numbered individually, without ref
erence to the divisions and brigades
to which they are attached. - Thus the
Second Division is composed of . the
Third Brigade, from Sendai, and the
Fifteenth Brigade, from Shibata. The
Third Brigade is composed of v the
Fourth and Twenty-ninth infantry
regiments, both from Sendai. and the
Fifteenth Brigade of the Sixtenth In
fantry, from Shibata, and the Thir
tieth, from Muramatsu. The head
quarters of the division is at Sendai.
TOKIO, Japan, March 17. â Yester
day began the movement from Tokio
of the First Division of the army. The
usual notification was given to the
public that something "was doing" in
the military way by knocking to pieces
the train schedule, which had not yet
recovered its old equilibrium after the
wrench it got when the first corps
was' sent away last month. Not a
word of what is going on appears in
any of the local newspapers and no
one in any authority will discuss It
with even his friends. The outsider is
left to put two and two together in the
best way' he can. If the result is four,
well and good; If it Is not the trouble is
more likely to be with something else
than his mathematics. But this cur
tailing of the public service on the
railways means that the second army
is moving out to the port of embarka
tion.
It should be made clear at the out
set that the Japanese army is not or
ganized in corps. It consists of twelve
divisions, each composed of two bri
gades, and the Imperial Guards, In all
thirteen divisions. In peace times the
regiments number only about half the
men called to the fighting line in war.
The extra men used to fill up the line
to its fighting strength are taken from
the First Reserve. Consequently, when
the first order of mobilization was sent
out on the evening of February 6 It
was not a general call to all the men
liable for military service, but only to
such as were needed to fill up the regi
ments then under orders, or about to
receive them, for the front â wherever
that mythical place may be. The
troops selected for the first service
have received no official designation as
a whole, but for the sake of conveni
ence they may be called the First
Corps. They were the Guards, the
Second and Twelfth divisions.
The first objective now was Plng
yang, where the Japanese had a sharp
engagement with the Chinese in their
war nine years ago. To this point
troops were sent at once, and at this
writing the Japanese occupy It in force
and have sent their 'advance /consider
ably farther north, to Anju, where
they have had several little brushes
with Russian scouts. But still no,se
rious engagement Is In sight for ._ the
near future.
The naval successes have produced a
curiously mixed up change in the Japa
nese plans. They have undoubtedly ad
vanced the campaign as a whole 1 by a
considerable. time, possibly a month 1 or
more. At the same â¢ tlme"^ they -'have i
delayed the' departure" * of' f troops .from *
Japan. The time It: would' have taken
to march up from MJasampho,' or .wher
ever, they might have .landed on" the
south coast of Korea, has been saved,
and it has not been necessary to start
the troops away from home. As a mat
ter of fact/if it were not for the un
favorable weather conditions, which
make landing still farther up the coast
not only difficult, but productive of
unnecessary hardship upon the men,
the second corps would probably have
been mobilized some time ago and al
ready landed north of Haiju, perhaps
even ud at Chenampho or even in the
Korean Gulf. The first corps was mobil
ized very quickly and transported with
When the order- was Issued calling
the reserves .of these three divisions
to the colors the plan of the Japanese
contemplated some much inore - se
vere work than the event proved was
necessary. Before the war beran
there was much talk that the; first op
erations would involve .the seizure of
Masampho, on the southern coast of
Korea, with its splendid harbor, as a
great base, from which the main ad
vance would begin. That Involved
marching practically entire Jap
anese army the whole length of ' the
rugged Korean Peninsula before even
a start was made at ejecting the Rus
sians from Manchuria. But at that
time the Japanese apparently had fig
ured on having to fight for Seoul and
Korea. The first naval operations,
however, resulted so successfully for
them that they were relieved of that
hard necessity, and were enabled to
seize Seoul and make sure of Korea
with hardly a struggle. Thereupon the
plans were changed. The main body
of the first army, or first corps, was
landed at Chemulpo, and aa events con
tinued to favor them several thousand
of these men were taken some seventy
miles farther by sea and landed at
Haiju.

SEOUL, Korea. April 2. â It is re
ported here that 2000 Russian troops,
including Cossapks and infantrymen,
are entrenched about the gate on the
south side of the Wiju. According to
statements made by Koreans the Rus
sians are utilizing trained dogs to act
as messengers and order bearers. The
circulation here of counterfeit fivfc
yen Japanese notes is causing great
annoyance.

the Russians great trouble, and be of
tremendous assistance to the main

through the mountains beyond the
Korean frontier.
TO ATTACK VLADIVOSTOK. '
There remains Vladivostok, pro
tected by an impassable river, the Tu
mon. and by rugged mountains and
defended by hijrh hills and gTCat guns.
There is talk thjt the Japanese can
go up Amur Bay and land men behind
the town, under cover of the guns of
the navy. If that is possible It may
make the task much simpler. But if
they have to land on the mainland,
below Possiet Bay. and march up the
Job Is not likely to be finished this
summer. They have already sent some
troops to Gensan, on the east coast of
Korea, about half way up, and there
is talk that a column will be landed
thereabouts to m&rch toward Vladi
vostok. That will be a hike worth see
ing, if it is attempted. Vladivostok
seems likely to play an important part
in the Japanese campaigns.
There is no talk.here. but of Japan
ese success in the war and when they
come to settle the bill they must hold
Russian territory if they are to exact
Indemnity from the Czar. Port Ar
thur will not suffice. Xo doubt with
most of the Japanese there is more
desire to take Port Arthur than Vladi
vostok. They feel that it would be
retributive Justice to capture it from
the Russians and the present indica
tion is that they will gratify that de
sire. *. ; . - .,
It has been officially, intimated to the
newspaper men here that there will be
three principal columns of Japanese
troops. The course of only one of them
has been indicated in any way so far.
That is the one now forming in Korea.
It seems to be indicated by the situa
tion that one of the others will land
somewhere on the. Liaotung peninsula,
either to assist the main column by a
turning movement toward Mukden or
to Invest Port Arthur. More likely the
investment of Port Arthur will be taken
by an independent force and the turn
ing movement will be made. That
leaves the third column for Vladi
vostok.
But.-as I said before, it is' too early
in the game to make any prognostica
tions.; The headquarters staff has not
yet been entirely selected. It is under
stood that General Kuroki will be the
commander in ' chief of all the armies
in the field. Neither Marshal Oyama
nor Marsha] Tamagata will take the
field in person. General Kuroki is ex
pected to go with the main column,
which will have the central position.
Less than fcalf the Japanese army has
been ordered out as yet, and it is ap
parent that if will be weeks. If not
j months, before the serious work of the
summer gets under way. Some of us
who have been waiting here in Tokio
for nearly twp months for the opportu
nity to get to the front with the Japa
nese troops, find a little consolation
now in remembering that we wrote
long ago that the Japanese would not
1 undertake a winter campaign.

VLADIVOSTOK. April 2. â Twelve
of the customs officers at Vladivostok
have been withdrawn and sent to
Irkutsk. This is the first step in the
direction of closing the custom-house

pects In consequence of the war. It Is
expected here that Vladivostok will be
declared a free port after, the conclu
sion of the war.

BUSSIANS BURY i
JAPANESE KILLED
AT POET ARTHUR
TOKIO. -April 2.â Field . Marshal
Tamagata. who, after the Emperor, Is
tlrst In command of the Japanese
forces. ' and was the original- organizer
c the Japarese arm; said'to-daÂ«r
that the Japanese might have to fight
odds of two to one, and that the clash
might come at the Yalu River. The
marshal said:
"Russian V, troops have been coming
south for a long time, and it is evi
dent that a conflict must result. As
matters have . turned out, Â»it .would
have been better If the war had occur
red when Uhe 'Russians first occupied
Manchuria, because ever since then
they have been strengthening their po
sition in that province. Our states
men, however, wished to preserve
peace as long as possible. It is diffi
cult to say where the first big land bat
tle will take place.. The Russians seem
to be In force between Liaoyang and
Kalping. on the Manchurian Railway.
They, may cross the mountains and
possibly meet us at the Yalu.
"Bridges and roads north of the Anju
have been destroyed by the Russian
troops, and therefore the Japanese ad
vance will be difficult. No doubt if
the Russians destroy the Manchurian
Railway it will be difficult to repair
it for the use of the Japanese tr.oops.
We might even have to replace the old
material with new; but the difficulty
Is to reach the railroad.
"Five months ago the Russian gen
erals planned to put 350.000 men in the
field. Tljoy must have" contemplated
supplying them with ammunition and
â¢codj ! â¢ .< -*Â«*||Â»ia
"iwo rivers that empty into the Arc
tic Sea run near Lake Baikal. They
are navigable in summer, and can be
used for transportation. The Russians
in this way need not rely entirely on
the railroad. Large supplies of Ameri
can flour have been going to Vladi
vostok for years, and we must expect
to meet a well-equipped and well-nour
ished army of 230,000 men. It is a dif
ficult matter to fight a nation with
â¢2.000.000* soldiers.
"There is no doubt that the Cossack
cavalry will worry the Japanese army,
which was originally intended for home
defense in the mountainous country
nnd is mainly composed of infantry.
But we must work with the material
we possess."
Kim Ka Jin has been appointed
Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs,
following- Pak Che Sun In this office.
Pak Che Sun was until recently Ko
rean Minister to China. Before thy
office of Foreign' Minister was given
to Kim Ka Jin it was declined by Pak
Che Sun. who said he did not wish to
officiate.
Kim Ka Jin is a very prominent
man In Korea and has In the. past been
head of several ministerial depart
ments. He was a member of the Pro-*
gressive party in 1884. He was until
very recently chief of the Privy Coun
cil, but be has not enjoyed high fa
vor because of his progressive princi
ples. His sympathies are with Japan.
American gold mines at Unsan. which
had" been held up by the authorities
south of Anju. has been released and
permitted to proceed. The minlns
company does not expect 'any further
difficulty in its transportation oper
ations. - VsV ../"-;

tally. The shooting was in Salmon's
room and was the result of the atten
tions which Sneldeki was forcing upon
Salmon's mother. He had called at the
house scorete of times during the past
several weeks and had repeatedly de
manded of the woman that she marry
him. She refused every time he made
the proposal, and on one occasion he
tried to cut his throat because of her
refusal.
To-day he appeared at the house and
again demanded that she marry him,
but she again refused. He then said
he would get a marriage license and
return, and if she did not consent then
he would kill somebody. An hour later
he again appeared at the house, and,
entering young Salmon's room, accused
him of having influenced his mother
not to consent to marrying him. Dur
ing the quarrel which followed Snei-^
deki attacked the young man, who fled
from the room; but his assailant fol

TUNA, Tibet. April' 2.â The Tibetan
general, the whole of his personal es
cort and five L'Hassa officials were
among. the hundreds killed in fighting
on March 31 at Guru, Tibet. The small
British losses are accounted for by the
fact that the Tibetans were so huddled
together that the majority were unable
either to use their swords or to fire.
The swordsmen in the front rank could
not reach the Sikhs, who had fixed
bayonets, while the men in the middle
of the mob could not reach the enemy,
but many of them probably killed one
another in the mad excitement. The
scene recalled old-time fights in cock
pits, the grim, determined faces of the
Tibetans, lighted by devildom sav
agery, expressing contempt for the
Sikhs, whom they outnumbered six or
seven to one.
"When the L'Kassa general fired the
first shot the Tibetans with wild shouts
drew their swords, fired their match
locks and surged forward. About a

ARMORED CABS PROTECT RUSSIANS
TUNA, Tibet, April 2.â The fighting
at Guru will "not alter the political as
pect of the British mission to Tibet,
which is going to Giangtse, as had been
arranged. Colonel Younghusband has
not received any communication since
the fight from either Chinese or Tibetan
officers.
The Tibetan general killed at Guru
belonged to one of the most influential
families at Lassa. Among the iden
tified dead was found the body of the
most, truculent Lassa Lama, well
known to the political officers. All the
Tibetan prisoners have now been re
leased. A British force is occupying
Guru, where the telegraphic line is ex
tending.
The Tibetan wounded were attended
by surgeons and men from the British
force, whose attentions were gratefully
received without a show of cringing,
the wounded men preserving an atti
tude of proud indifference.
WOUNDED TIBETANS
PROUDLY SCORNFUL
OF THEIR CAPTORS
PARIS, April 2.â The British advance
on Tibet is attracting widespread at
tention, the general view being- that it
is due mainly to Russia's preoccupa
tion In the Far East. Government offi
cials are inclined to share this opin
ion. An Embassador said to-day:
"It is manifest that Russia's hands
being tied gives Great Britain an op
portunity to advance in Tibet. As part
of the same diplomacy,. Great Britain
is re-establishing, friendly relations
with France, thus neutralizing any
French oposition to the Tibetan pro
gramme."
In this connection the Embassador
related a conversation with Foreign
Minister Delcasse regarding the Fash
oda incident. It was pointed out dur
ing the conversation that if the in
cident had occurred while Great Brit
ain's hands had been tied by the Boer
war the future of Central . Africa
would have been entirely different.
ENGLAND ACTIVE
WHILE RUSSIANS
WAR WITH JAPAN
LONDON*. April :. â It is feared in
high quarters that Great Britain's
continental enemies may seize upon
;he slaughter of Tibetans near Guru
as a pretext for launching a campaign
of abuse against this country. It is
â¢recalled that the Boer war. which was
a campaign of the same nature, al
most produced an international crisis
of the gravest order. There is no
doubt that Russian susceptibilities
have been wounded by the British ex
pedition to Tibet and that any ef
fective plans for causing Great Britain
embarrassment in connection there
with would be relished in St. Peters
â¢burg.
Downing street has already been ad- :
vised of the activity of certain promi
nent Russians in the direction of
establishing close relations between
the dual and triple alliances at the ex
pense of Great Britain. King Edward's
Ministers are alive to the possibilities
of the situation, but scarcely believe
that anything Russia can do will dis
turb the growing cordiality of France
and England and Italy and England.
They feel absolutely certain, what
ever may arise, of the firm friendship
of Japan and the United States.
Abandoning all pretense as to the
nature of Colonel Younghusband's
mission to Tibet, the Standard says:
'â¢For the defense of India, and for
no other purpose. English officers and
Indian soldiers have been sent to Tibet
to endure the hardships of its Inhos
pitable mountains."
UNNECESSARY BLOODSHED.
The slaughter of Tibetans kills such
waning interest as still existed in Lon
don in the Japanese and Russian strug
gle. The news of the wholesale blood
shed excites, as a general rule, a feel-
Ing- of depression, because the average
Englishman scarcely sees that it was
necessary "nd because there was gen
eral apprehension that it may lead to
cOmpHcaticms vith Russia.
The last thing the British public
wants at present is another war, and
what is most dreaded is a rise in the
income tax. Hence the tragic, events
in Tibet are especially unwelcome at
this period, when the taxpayer is nerv
ous-Iy waiting to see how he will be
called on to pay off the national debt.
The extreme Liberal papers seized
"â¢n the slaughter at Guru as one of
the wurst blots on the history of Eng-
Land. The News declares that no more
"wanton or discreditable business has
be^n brewed by our proconsuls in India
since the time of Lord Lytton."
Other papers of the same political
views describe Colonel Younghusband's
mission, as another Jamleson raid.
The Government organs, while ex
pressing the regret felt rn official cir
cles that such an event occurred at
this moment, reiterate Foreign Secre
tary Lansdowne's assurances to Rus
sia that Great Britain has no interw
tion of annexing Tibet. The text of
those who defend Colonel Younghus
band's action is Lord Lansdowne's
statement in the House of Lords that
all Great Britain desires is a new con
vention with the Tibetans, and with
China as the suzerain of Tibet.
'â¢ RISKS THE WORLD'S PEACE.
The opposition, however, points out
that China has repeatedly protested
against the strength of the escort with
which this "political mission" is ac
companied and declares that, as a.
matter of fact. Great Britain is now
at war, not with Tibet, but with Chi
na, thereby endangering China's neu
trality toward Russia and Japan and
risking the peace of the world. This
extreme view is ridiculed in official
circles, where the case of Cuba is in
stanced as a parallel.
It is held in Downing street that
Tibet, by refusing trade privileges,
returning official letters unopened and
not respecting boundary rights, has
become as dangerous a neighbor to
the Indian empire as Cuba in her un
rest was to the United States. Much
stress is laid on the fact that regret
table bloodshed was due at first only
to a hostile act emanating from the
Tibetans; but this defense is not
likely to have much weight in the agi
tation which the Liberal party doubt
less will foster against the motive that
prompted the expedition.
Lord Curzon of Kedleston, Viceroy
of India, is soon likely to share with
Lord Milner, British High Commis
sioner in South Africa, the bitter per
sonal hostility aroused among the op
ponents of the Government by the in
troduction of Chinese labor in the
Transvaal. In the minds of the
masses, who have shown in the bye
elections that they have lost faith in
the present Government, the slaugh
ter at Guru is likely to be regarded as
a stain on Lord Curzon's administra
tion, which only- the defeat of the re
sponsible Ministers can wipe out. The
Indian Secretary. Brodrick, the least
popular member of Balfour's CaWnet,
will again be in hot water, as the Min
ister must explain to Parliament.
CURZOX'S ILL-TIMED SPEECH.
Lord Curzon's recent speech at Cal
cutta, which, St. Petersburg dispatches
say, has created so much feeling, was
not warmly welcomed here, and at the
time it was thought he had indulged
in a dangerous wealth of Oriental
imagery suitable for the consumption
of native Princes, but eminently un
fitted for perusal at St. Petersburg and
Paris, in view of Great Britain's de
termination not to become involved in
the Far Eastern struggle.
The Government has done every
thing in its power to belittle and keep
quiet its plans in regard to Tibet. In
deed, if the war between Russia and
Japan had come earlier, it is likely that
the. Tibet expedition would have been
postponed. Though, apparently, Col
onel Younghusband's mission is mainly
aimed at destroying alleged Russian In
fluences in Tibet, Ihis is not regarded
as vital when compared with the para
mount importance of keeping clear of
the Russo-Japanese war.
It is not regarded as likely that seri
ous international complications will
follow this affair, but China's action
â¢will be rather anxiously awaited. The
Russian Minister at. Peking is not ex
pected to let the incident pass without
drawing some comparisons that will
scarcely be favorable to British policy
toward the Chinese Government.
Colonel Younghusband has 75 miles
more to travel before he reaches Gi
angtse, where he has been ordered to
stop to parley before actually demand-
ing entrance into L'Hassa. It is pos
sible that he may not be permitted to
proceed even to Giangtse, which is 160
miles from L'Hassa. But in any case,
it can be taken 'for granted that the
Government will do everything in its
power to prevent a repetition of the
bloody scenes at Guru.
Colonel Younghusband's escort, how
ever, is prepared for all eventualities,
and if the step is considered advisable
the force is probably strong enough to
reach L'Hassa and there establish
such control of affairs as might be
thought necessary. r*or this emer
gency, which scarcely seems likely to
crop up. Kitchener supervised the fit
ting out of the command of Colonel
Macdunald, which is escorting Colonel
Younghusband, the political agent of
the Indian Government.
dozen swordsmen made a desperate at
tempt in the direction of Colonel Slac
donald and a small knot of "officers.
Four Tibetans attacked Candler, the
correspondent of the London Daily
Mail, but Colonel Macdonald seized* a
rifle and shot down two of them "at a
few yards, and another officer killed the
other two, thus saving Candler's life.
Â¦ Those of the,. Tibetans who tried , to
climb the wall were met with a terrible
magazine rifle fire, but they did not
falter, those behind springing over the
heaps of dead and continuing the fight
until riddled with bullets. Â¦ ; ,
Â¦ When finally the Tibetans retired
they tramped back slowly and stead
ily, though followed 'by a hail of bul
lets. A mountain battery, was brought
into action and tore the retreating
lines with shrapnel. A terrible trail of
dead and dying marked the line of
march. At length the last wounded
and limping Tibetan turned the corner,
some 400 yards from the scene'of the
grim tragedy, where the best of the
Tibetan army had perished. â¢

There could be no greater fallacy, as
the worst possible cases of piles are
permanently cured, by the use of Pyra-
mid Pile Cure, which la In suppository
form, Is applied' directly to the source
of the complaint, and removes the
cause, which an operation does not. i
"I have been a sufferer from piles for

conclusion to give Pyramid Pile Cure

Why. do physicians always advise an
operation for the cure of hemorrhoids,
or piles? Are they unconsciously In-
fluenced by the dicta of operating sur-
geons, who stoutly assert and maintain
that all other treatments are merely
palliative, and that the knife affords
the only means of cure?"

King is an old' resident of Hueneme.
His companion is a boy about 16 years
of age and the only son In a large fam
ily. His mother is almost frantic over
his disappearance.
VENTURA, April 2.â Jack. King and
Arley Teters left the little port of
Hueneme a week ago last Tuesday fur
a day's fishing in the Santa Barbara
Channel. Since that time nothing has
been heard of them. They went out
in a small open boat with food enough
for but one day, and intended to re
turn at 'nightfall. A severe storm pre
vailed en tho channel on Tuesday, and
it was supposed at first that the fish
ermen had sought shelter In one of
the many coves on Anacapa Island.
King is a well-known fisherman and
an expert sailor, and but little fear
was felt for the safety of the party.
As the days went by, however, and no
tidings came, their disappearance caus
ed great anxiety.
On Thursday Captain Thomas Mer
ry, who perhaps knows the channel
and the islands better than any other
person in this section, organized a
searching party, and in his yacht Daisy
set out from Santa Barbara for Ana-'
capa. He put into Hueneme to-day
without having obtained any informa
tion or finding any trace of the lost
men.

ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS.
Cash In Bank Vaults Surpasses Any
Total Previously Recorded.
NEW YORK, April 2. â The Fi
nancier says: An expansion of nearly
$15,000,000 in loans and of more- than
$20,000,000 in deposits, accompanied
by a gain of over $5,000,000 in cash,
were the principal features of the"
bank statement last week. Both loans
and deposits make new . high records
and the cash in. bank vaults surpasses
any total previously recorded. The
. accumulation of funds was greatly in
excess of the amount of increase as
estimated from the traceable move
ments of money during the week, in
dicating large unreported , receipts.
The expansion of loans resulted partly
from the placing of fifty millions of
the' Pennsylvania notes, which was,ef
fected on Friday. The public de
posits were increased $15,618,700 dur
ing the fortnight, caused by the con
centration of these funds in New York
depositories. The ; cash reserve was
Increased $5,461,400 and the required
reserve, resulting from the increase
of $20,700,900 deposits, was augment
ed by $5,140,225, deducting which
sum from . the gain in , cash leaVes
$280,175 as the increase jn surplus re
serve' to $27,755,150. Computed upon
the basis of 'deposits,-- less those of
$56,10^,400 public funds, the surplus
is $41,781,900: : ;.
Loans were Increased $14,843,400.

POMONA, April 2.â Elmer W. Swan
ton, editor and proprietor of the Po
mona Daily Review, died this morning
after a long Illness with Bright's dis
ease. His death had been expected
hourly for days, and it . is wonderful
that his vitality endured so long. He
was 58 years of age.
For several years he had been the

mona Valley and a | man . of Influence
in this region. He was formerly .presi
dent of the Maine State Press Associa
tion and an ally of'James G. Blaine in
his campaign for the Presidency. When
he was a young man he served as sec
retary to Senator Charles Sumner of
Massachusetts. The deceased leaves' a
wife and four children. The Pomona
Review will be run for a short time
by the Swanton estate.
NOTED EDITOR
PASSES AWAY
IN THE SOUTH
In -tho present torpid state of the
public demand for stocks the supposi
tion of speculative operations seems
inadequate. The conviction is there
fore general that there has been an
important accumulation of Union Pa
cific stock for jj some other than the
speculative purpose of reselling at an
advance. : . Last week's surmise that
Morgan-Hill interests were taking the
stock to balance the* Harrlman-Kuhn-
Loeb holdings in Northern Pacific and
Great Northern was supplemented this
week by circumstantial assertions that
St. Paul and Standard Oil interests
were acquiring Union Pacific control
to assure a Pacific Coast outlet for St.
Paul. The of 'such/'anV outlet
was admitted by St. Paul at the time
of the purchase of , the Burlington, and
steps, toward that' end were taken at
the lime. It would be useless to sum
up all the rumors and assertions of
the week '. that Ingenuity and specula
tion have prompted on this basis.* This
has been the motive power of the mar
ket. Its effectiveness has x been fos
tered by some â¢Â¦ encouraging factors In
the general conditions. 1 Money is abun
dant rates have: declined. The
transfer' of '- Government ' deposits -" to

Influence. '\ The^ crop outlook continues
But the embarrassment of the enor
mous tie-up of capital for maintaining
the holdings of the various interests in
the company prompted the holding
company for the purpose of allowing
the release of some of the capital in
volved without relinfluishment' of con
trol. This is accepted as a demonstra
tion of a way out for actual'commu
nity of interest without conflicting
with the Supreme Court decision. The
present speculation seems based upon
the assumption that with a way open
for- securing community of interest in
the railroad world there will be a re
newal of tho- projects which were
nipped in the bud by the Judicial dis
approval of the Securities Company.
The one substantial basis for the as
sumption that such policies are work
ing out is the continued large absorp
tion of Union Pacific stock. There was
a time when transactions in as large
volume as those recently made in Un
ion Pacific might have been plausibly
set down to a purely speculative cam
paign, but that was when abroad, gen
eral limit for stocks , could be relied
upon for quick absorption of specula
tive holdings.

Feeling has crystallized in Wall street
that the dissolution of the Northern
Securities Company has the effect of
re-establishing the conditions of the
Northern Pacific settlement as they
were before the formation of the
Northern Securities Company. It will
be remembered that a compromise
board of directors has been named by
J. P. Morgan for the Northern Pacific,
which included Union Pacific repre
sentatives and effected an actual com
munity of interests in that company.
UNION" PACIFIC IN DEMAND.
The volume and the character of the
transactions in the great Pacific and
transcontinental railroad stocks give
ample warrant for the prevalent as
sumption that important operations
are working out in that field designed
to establish financial policies on the
part of the great forces of railroad
capital. What the policies are have not
been established, and conjecture on the
subject has afforded ample material
for SDeculation and the flotation of
rumors to further it, which have va
ried constantly and almost from day
to day. It is manifest that many of
these rumors have had their origin
from a traversal of the history of the
events leading up to the formation of
the Northern Securities Company and
th^nrojects which were afterward dis
cussed to meet the conditions of the
merger.
Prices of stocks have moved in, an
irregular way during the week, with
numerous^ reactions, but the undertone
has been strong, and there has been a
considerable broadening of interest in
the market. The principal market in
fluence was the dissolution of the
Northern Securities Company and its
supposed consequences, but it is prob
able that- a revival of speculation
would have occurred Â¦ anyhow as an
outcome of the factors usually oper
ative in the spring of the year, when
the outlook for future business natural
ly begins to take form .and money con
ditions at the reserve centers are likely
to nfford facilities for speculative op
erations. . .
NEW YORK, April 2.â To-day's stock
market was an insignificant affair, as
was eapected of a two hours' session
between two holidays. The fact that
the London market was. closed to-day
was an additional incentive to ab
senteeism on the part of the Stock Ex
change members. The drift of prices
was sluggish throughout. The Pacific
stocks t specially receded from their re
cent prominence in the market Peo
ple's Gas suffered from profit tak
ing, and was a depressing influence on
the general list. The Weather Bureau's
crop bulletin and the weekly-reviews of
the commercial agencies were not suffi
ciently cheerful to induce any buying
of stocks, but there was no urgent
pressure to sell. The bank statement
revealed the large transactions which
have been going on in the money mar
ket, but the maintenance last week of
the full surplus by the offsetting of
other items, and the extreme ease
now ruling in the money market pre
vented any anxiety over the banking
situation. The cash items reflected
the receipt of Government deposits
from interior banks coming over from
iast week's operations. The Govern
ment deposits included JnMhe deposit
item amount to {56,107,400, compared
with S45.948.1OO last week. The expan
sion of nearly 515.000,000 in the loan
item is considered corroborative of the
rumors of large loans contracted dur
ing the week in connection with stock
market operations. Yesterday's pay
men of subscriptions to the $50,000,000
Pennsylvania issue probably figures in
this item also. The market closed easy
on a late selling movement.
Total sales of bonds were (par value)
$1,540,000.

â¢ Thousands of physicians now pre-
scribe Grape-Nuts food in; all cases
where strength Is expected from food.
"There V a. reason." '
. Look In each ] pkg. - for the famous
little book. "The Road to Wellvllle." "
"Now' notwithstanding she is also
Just recovering from a severe attack
of the whooping cough, which she
has had for the last. three*. months,- she
has gained steadily in weight, is grow-
ing nicely and her. entire recovery 13
promising and hopeful and we are
confident of complete success.
"Our surgeon Is delighted with the
rapid Improvement she is making and
both he and ourselves are more than
thankful that vte tried! Grape-Nuts."
The writer of this letter is the /Pas-
tor of a church at Warrensville, Ohio.

"For a year and a half she barely
held her own until Grape-Nuts was
tried, which she liked from the first,
and in two months gained two pounds
in weight where during the 18 months
proceeding she. had lost weight.
"This sounded easy, but proved Â» a
difficult case to treat, as there were
so many foods recommended -that did
not agree with her or that she did not
like and therefore would not eat.
. The surgeon who is attending a
dangerous case praises the food that
helped' his little patient.
"I have a story to tell about what
Grape-Nuts did and is still doing: for
my child, a story marvelous indeed,
which. seems almost incredible, but
which is an absolute fact.
"Two years ago in March my little
four-year-old daughter was stricken
down with Tuberculosis of the right
hip Joint. We put her. in charge of u
specialist for treatment. He told
us that our. only hope of saving her
hip and perhaps her life in addition
to his surgical treatment was to build
up her system with good nourishing
food to make good rich blood, bone,
muscle And .fat, which in time would
cure the disease by absorption.

ROBBERS WORK
AN OLD TRICK
As scon as he 'was out of the store
the inside man rushed 'behind the
counter and easily opened the register,
which was of an obsolete pattern.
Drucker was wholly unmindful of .what
had happened in his absence. The man
who had pretended he wanted sponges
informed him as he entered that he
would be back in a minute,.', and ran
from the place, jumped Into the buggy
and was quickly driven off by hiaspon
federate.
Drucker realized in an instant what
had taken place, and, going to his till.
tqick was worked with success.
One of the robbers entered" the store
and asked Andrew Drucker, who was
tending store, to show him some
sponges. Just as he did so a man in
a buggy drove up before the door and
beckoned the drug man to come out.
The crook in the store assured'tlie pro
prietor that he was in no hurry/ "Go
ihead and wait-on that fellow outside,"
he said. Drucker complied.
tal, .which, caused, a great amount of
consternation... r ;Jt is reported that
Marquis has . gathered his forces
around him and intends to make a
strenuous fight at this meeting .for
reinstatement. .- The society has 6000
members. ,
discovered that the thief had . w tdken
what gold and large silver was in-^it,
which amounted to $6o Running fffcm
his. store, the drug clerk called "Stop
thief!- stop thief !" -The' streets were
crowded, and several pedestrians* join
ed in the chase, but the robbers in^the
buggy had a good start and escaped.
' Drucker, reported the matter to the
pulice, but no one has yet been appre
hended for the crime. He says he will
not prosecute the men -if they -are
caught. "I was the victim of an o'd
trick, they .tell me; so I guess that I
can stand it," he said.
The hj'persehsiti ve are apt to ,"" be
wholly selfish.
An election has. been ordered 'for
the 18th inst. in Company.' C, Fifth
Infantry,' located af Petaluma,"for sec
ond lieutenant, : vice _Rodd.\. The' fol
lowing night there will. be_ an election
in Cbmpany G.'samVregim'erit,' located

At the reception there were ad
dresses by District Attorney Thomas
P. Boyd, Captain Gorley, an oldÂ»-time
Grand Army comrade of General
Lauck; Supreme Judge F. M. Angrel
lotti. E. B.Matinelli and Lieutenant
J. K. Hawkins, who delivered the ; ad
dress of welcome, which was grace
fully responded to by- General Lauck.
During" the evening the Fifth Infantry
Band furnished the music.
The inspection of Company I, Fifth.
Infantry, at Livermore was in the main
very satisfactory, judging from the
happy and encouraging address : of
Major Wilhelm, United States inspec
tor, and the remarks of Colonel Kos
ter, the State inspector. Among those
present at the inspection were Colonel
J. F. Hayes, commanding the regi
ment; Major D. A. Smith, the battalion
adjutant, and Captain Milliken, who
Inspected the property. After inspec
tion a collation was served at the
Hotel Washington. Good progress is
being made on the new armory for
the company and in a short time-it
will occupy its new quarters. As soon
as Sweeney's Opera-house in the place
named is ready for opening the â¢ dra-.
matic club of Company I will present
a military drama, entitled "Santiago."
Adjutant General Lauck was the
first captain of Company D, Fifth In
fantry, located at San Rafael, and last
week that official paid a visit to ( ..his
old company, accompanied by Mrs.
Lauck Rnd Colonel H." Sontag of the
Governor's staff. They were tendered
a reception by the charter and ex
members of the company, as- well as
by the present membership, and a very
pleasant evening was spent In the
armory, the affair having 'been ar
ranged by Captain Vanderbilt, com
manding the company.

Major Ducat, U. S. A., to the War De

shows a large attendance of citizens at
the camp, standing uncovered during
the inspiring ceremony.^ While exhibit

an ingenious arrangement contrived
by Captain Eisen the American flag 'as

INSPECTION OF COMPANY I.
The next lecture of the series of thc
current year before the First Battalion
of Artillery In the Ellis street armory
will be on the evening of April 6, by J.
W. Erwin, on "Honolulu, the Beauti

the leadership of Chief Musician
Mathieu, will furnish the music, and
Captain Eisen, battalion adjutant, will
handle the stereopticon slides that are
to illustrate the lecture. At the close
of the lecture there will be exhibited
a number of views showing events in
which the four batteries when a part
of the First California took part in the
fighting in the Philippines, also real

ROUGH KXEKCISE.
It was rough exercise, considering
the conditions, but it was a' good ex
emplification of what the men might
expect in actual service. Each com
mander exercised caution to prevent
surprise and capture,' but Captain
Gratton's command was the shrewdest,
for despite the scouts and advance
guard it suddenly sprang from a place
that afforded excellent concealment
and compelled the other command to
surrender. The outing was such .an In
teresting one that the men are making
arrangements for another in the near
future. >.* Â¦Â¦â¢cv-'"-.:
This wa<followed by a short drill by
Captain Miller, after which the battery
was dismissed and the many friends of
the officers and members, including a
large number of ladies, spent the rest
of the evening in dancing.
Notwithstanding the fact that lt was
wet under, foot and threatening over
head last Sunday, two batteries of the
First Artillery Battalion, numbering
fifty-four men, left the Ellis street
armory for a practice march, one party
Â£Olng in the direction of the ocean
beach and the other in the vicinity of
Ingleside. The two parties moved over
the sand dunes, in the groves and trees
and In the undergrowth, each with the
Idea of surprising the other and mak
ing "prisoners of war."
Nearly every member of the battery
was present, and after a short drill by
Lieutenant Eason, during which the
men acquitted themselves with credit.
Sergeants Hawvichorst and Ohlson and
Corporal Castle were called to the
front and each presented his warrant
as a non-commissioned officer.
* State decorations for proficiency in
rifle practice during the last year were
presented to Lieutenants Eason and
Homer, Sergeants O'Conner, Schloss,
Schwinn and Hawvichorst, Corporal
Jensen and Privates Biglow, Guerin
and Sablatchan.
Last Monday night was a sala day
In the Ellis street armory, when Cap
tain John A. Miller assumed command
of ,Battery A. First Battalion of Ar

his commission should be presented to

REDDING, April 2.â The trip of the
officers north on the railroad this aft
ernoon resulted in proving to their sat
isfaction that the bandits who held up
the Oregon, express at Copley Thurs
day, night and killed Messenger O'Nell
are the. same thugs who held up fifteen
men In Dave Endlcotfs saloon at Ken
nett, twenty miles north of here, on
March 20. In the party that made the
trip were Railroad Detectives William
Ahern and A. W. O'Brien, Sheriff J. L.
Richardson and Deputies George Wiley,
W. W. Wheeler and j A. 'â¢ M. Carpenter.
They went as far north as Kennett
and returned, to Reading without any
prisoners'. . '??5v* ". '
, The -officers '-say that a dozen differ
ent persons had told them circum
stances that seemed to point strongly
to three men Hying near Kennett being
the ' train robbers, but an investigation
to-day showed conclusively that the
suspectB could not have been concerned
in it. The trip ; to . Kennett,- however,
while . precluding the necessity of the
arrest.that the ofllcers expected to make
when the:' left here, showed conclu
sively to' the -mind of Detective Ahern
that the-three robbers who held up the
lOndicott saloon \ at \ Kennett on March
20 are the same men who killed Mes
senger O'Nell at Copley [on Thursday
night.- Ahern said this evening that he
is confident that .the crimes were com
mitted by. the same gang. There are a
number bfj reasons,; he said, for arriv
ing at that conclusion. : Chief among
them is the abundance of "profanity
that ' the men used 'In both hold-ups.
While - art Kennett _ v to-day Detective
Ahern had a" long talk wlthM.E. Ar
rlghlni; the 'bartender who was on duty
when the saloon was robbed, and from
him learned : that the leader in ; that
robbery; gave his commands in sharp,
cjear tones, as did the. leader : In' the

Detective Ahern' said the bartender
gave ". him I a good - descri ption Â¦Â¦_ of :. the
saloon. .robbers: and. he ', \i â¢ confident
they were;.; also the" train robbers."
Nothing' has yet been learned,- accords
Ing, to Aherh, as to â¢where the bandits

SAN JOSE, April 2.â A fistic en
counter between Attorney Ed M. Rea
of the San Jose and Los Gatos electric
railway and George W. Elder, the con
tractor of the road, occurred this morn-
Ing: at the corner of Santa Clara and
Market streets^ The trouble- grew' out
of the fact that the men employed: on
the road have not, been paid for the
last two months. Elder has been claim
ing that Attorney -Rea had 'been the
means of stopping- the payment of the
money by the company. When the men
met this morning Rea asked Elder, if
he had made such a statement. Elder
entered a'denial, whereupon Dan Ryan,
politician, who was present, declared
that Elder had made such a statement.
Rea then struck 1 Elder In the face with
his right fist, knocking him down.
Elder got up and -Rea hit him again.
Elder declined â¢ to fight. Elder's face
was badly cut.
A number of the workmen who have
been employed in the construction of
the Interurban road to-day maintained
a boycott against the electric line at
the corner of Market and Santa Clara
streets. They carried an American flag,
and when passengers attempted to en
ter a car they were asked not to do so,
as the road has not paid its employes.
The men say they have not been paid
for the last two. months. The amount
due them is between $3000 and $4000.
They have engaged Attorneys W. A.
Bowden, and E. L. Rlfodes to collect
their claims. Elder has the contract
for the construction of the San Jose
and Los Gatos Interurban Railway,
and has received 75 per cent of the
amount due him for the work. The
other 25 per." cent is held back for a
certain period In case liens should be
filed against the road for the construc
tion. The road is completed with the
exception of a branch line from ' Sara
toga to Congress Springs. Â¦; Elde- has
been trying to -get some of . this 25 per
cent to pay' the. amount due his men,
but the company has refused to give
any of It to him! The directors say
that at the proper time the money will
be paid. ,

secured brinsrs out a new incident of
the train hold-up. When the gun of
Frank Rockwell, the guard,, failed to
explode the cartridge and he was
compelled to surrender the bandits
stood Rockwell against the wall of the
express car while they made prepara
tions to dynamite the safe. . One of
the robbers leaned his rifle against
the wall near Rothwell. The guard
cautiously moved his foot aldng until
It came in contact with the butt of the
weapon, causing it to fall to the floor.
The robbers. noticed It fall, but did not
realize that Rockwell had caused it
to j fall. After the fuse had been
lighted and the robbers were filing
out of the car one of them, who had
laid down his -gun, picked up Roth
well's, which was still leaning against
.the wall. That was Just what Rock
well had hosed for. The bandit's
rifle was not Injured by the explosion
and is in the hands of the officers. It
Is said to be an extraordinary rifle,
but -its possession may lead to the
identity of the bandit owner being es
tablished. *'.::Â£' vVr

If such persons would lay their
prejudices aside and make a regular
practice of taking, after each meaL
one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets the food would be quickly and
thoroughly digested, because these
tablets contain the natural peptones
and diastate which every weaJi stom-
ach lacks, and by supplying this want
the stomach is soon enabled to regain
Its natural tone and vigor.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets digest
every form of flesh forming food,
meat, eggs, bread and potatoes, and
this Is the reason they so quickly build
up, strengthen and Invigorate thin,
dyspeptic men. women and children.
Invalids and children, even the most
delicate, use them with marked ben-
efit, as they contain no strong, Irri-
tating drugs, no cathartic nor any
harmful ingredient.
" Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is thfj
most successful and most widely
known of any remedy for stomach
troubles because it is the most rea-
sonable and scientific of modern med-
icines.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold
by every druggist ln the United States
and Canada, as well as in Great Bri-
tain, at 50 cents for complete treat-
ment.
Nothing further is required to cure
any stomach trouble or to make thin,

plump and well .: ,, :.
There are thousands of such who
are really confirmed dyspeptics, al-
though they may have no particular
pain or inconvenience from their
stomachs.
But the trouble is that while we eat
enough and generally too much, the
stomach, from abuse ahd overwork,
docs not properly digest and assimilate
it. which is the reason Â«o many peo-
ple remain thin and under weight;
the digestive organs do not complete-
Jy digest the flesh forming beefsteak
and ergs and similar wholesome food.
Common sense would suggest that
If one wishes to become fleshv and
plump U can only result from the food
we eat and digest and that food
should be albuminous of flesh forming
food., like eggs, beefsteak and cereals;
ln other words the klntfs of food that
make flesh are the foods which form
the greater part of our daily bills of
fare.

ARKANSASâ Subscriber, Cltv. There
are many people who pronounce the
name of the State of Arkansas as If

nounce it as if written Ar-kan-saw.
The legislative body of that State
settled this matter in March. 1881. by
adopting Ar-kan-saw as the proper
pronunciation, holding that that was
the pronunciation as heard by the

CHAMP CLARK serves in Congress, lectures* to
the summer Chautauquas, and also writes for the
newspapers. One neve^. knows in which capa
city he shows the real Clark. 'As a lecturer ' he and
Senator Dolliver of Iowa make up their routes and
travel together. As a Congressman he and the Senator
travel apart. As a newspaper writer he goes alone,
and docs not recognize himself in the capacity of a
Congressman. His latest newspaper work is an article
on "The Vice Presidency," published in "The Saturday
Evening Post." that medium through which retired
public men, like Mr. Cleveland,, and active public men,
like Senator Beveridge, make their views known on all
subjects, from fishing to"the s Eastcrn question.
In this article Mr. Clark mixes statistics with, obser
vations upon the personality of Lincoln and other public
men. ,Hc places the Vice Presidency highly, and de
clares that there arc only four citizens of the republic
who could refuse it on rational grounds, if offered to
them. this year,- and f'icsc are, Grover Cleveland, Theo
dore Roosevelt, Chief Justice Fuller arid Admiral Dewey.
The chief interest of the article is its discussion of
Brcsident Roosevelt, in which Champ Clark the writer
is not recognized as Champ Clark the Congressman and
politician. He says: "Colonel Roosevelt seems destined
to remove the hoodoo from Vice Presidents who reach
the Presidency accidentally/ at least, so far as the'norni
nation is concerned. That will be merely a pro forrria
transaction. ; His coming into' power was ' under most
favorable surroundings; the country was prosperous; his
party united, triumphant and aggressive. With the
laudable ambition of - being elected , President, he/ has
exhibited much more tact than . he had been credited

THE CALL, as an original proponent of the Sacra
mento Valley location for the Federal plant ex
periment station, is highly gratified that Chico is
finally selected and the ground, obtained. The Sacra
mento Valley Development Association took the matter
in;, hand, and the whole valley' concentrated upon Chico.
We arc pleased, too, with the area that-has been secured.
The station will occupy 300 acres of fine 'land, with irri
gation, drainage and everything that can bring, it into
the highest' action.
. There will.be finally the greatest plant experiment sta
tion in the world, a^ botanical garden more important
than the Kew ; Gardens in London or the Jardin des
Plantcs in Paris, for the sufficient reason-that the climate
and fixed. physical conditions make it possible to have
at Chico the greatest variety of plants ever grown in
the same : soil anywhere on earth. When it is in ; full
action it, will employ hundreds of men, will be a school
of instruction in vegetable physjology and pathology,
cultivation and uses, and will be not. only of the first
practical importance to California, but will be. one of the
greatest show places in the United : States. Its location
there is the strongest stroke for the State, in all its his
tory since the. discovery of gold. The Sacramento Val
ley, lias, needed . just that: impetus -to' its progress. Its
many towns have stood as one for Chico and therein
have learned the valuable lesson of the force of associa
tion and the benefit of pulling, together. ; : \

THE EXPERIMENT STATION.
Mayor Olney of Oakland is perhaps the most keen
sighted man in California. At a recent meeting of the
Alameda County Teachers' Institute Mr. Olney looked
into the future far as human eye can see and saw a
condition in which the teachers of the State will be bet
ter paid than they are now. The lives of politicians
teach us that Mr. Olney is entitled to another look.
By the stern decree'of Missouri justice a bank rob
ber of that State was hanged. the other day in expiation
of his offense. The incident is encouraging, as it indi
cates with sufficient clearness that the current belief
that Missouri- confines her hangings strictly to one class
is erroneous.
"Uncle Tom" the children call the
bent, white-haired. Uack-clad old man
who day in and day out appears at the
schoolhouse and distributes a big bag
of candy among the little ones. The
teachers also call \ him "Uncle Tom,"
and so do the residents in the immedi
ate neighborhood of the school.
He is a kindly, old fellow, and though,
when the little tots are not gathered
around him partaking of his bounty,
there sometimes can be seen a look of
sadness in his faded blue eyes,, his face
is generally lit up by a smiler-Just such
a smile as one usually associates with
a happy, contented "old age. It -was
while. "Uncle Tom's" face wore one of
these smiles that a teacher, recently as
signed to the school, asked, him why he
was" so fond of the little one3. ,
"Lord love ye. Miss," <said the old
fellow, "I love 'em all because once,
years ago, long afore you were born, I
had a little niece. 1 She was falr-halred
and had such bright blue eyes that to
me she was the bonniest little lass in
all the world. Then"â and here" the old
fellow's voice quivered and broke, , and
with a shaking hand he wiped. away
two big tears that coursed down his
cheeksâ "then 1 she died. In my old age
her memory haunts me, and these little
ones help me forget the misery of my
last days. Their 'Uncle Torn', is sweet
to these ' old" ears, .Missâ almost as
sweet as the 'Uncle Tom' of my little
blue-eyed pet." < /

Of all the birds the humming birds,
especially when young, seem to dis
play the. least fear, says a writer in
Country Life in America. It is a dif
ficult matter to train a young canary,
bird to follow one about the house -. or '
to come when called, yet we have had.?
several humming birds which were*
perfectly domesticated and" more thor->
oughly.tame than any bird I havd ey.er
seen. ; Two humming birds that grejw
up with us were given a small place
in a closet in our sleeping apartment.
At the first approach of daylight they
would fly out into the room, the door
being left ajar, and directly to the bed,
hovering ] over my face, their loud
humming noise awakening me at once.
There was no mistaking that the birds
â¢wished their breakfast and they could
not be driven away. At times I would
pretend not to see them and' they
would finally alight on the bed, utter- '
ing the quaint little sound, now per
haps a protest, then would hover over
my eyes, so near that the wind from
the rapidly moving wings was quite
sufficient to arouse me. When I held
out my finger one or both would alight
upon it and gaze at me in a manner
whicli spoke volumes ' to any. , one
Imaginative enough to think they un
derstood the language of birds when
they are hungry.
Their food consisted of eugar and
water, which was fed to them with a>
chopstlck-llke straw. Immediately
upon seeing it they would poise in the
air and lick the drop on the tip until
they were satisfied. Occasionally they
would poise before the big red flowers
printed on the curtains. They recog
nized the pictures of flowers on sight
and endeavored to press their bills
into them. Artificial flowers were ap
proached in the same way.- In a word,
these most helpless, the smallest of all
birds, required, no education, no.train
ing from parents; it was all instinctive.

"The young man was already In the
vehicle, and sitting beside him was a
woman., I judged by her figure that
she could not be very old. Well, â¢ we
drove along in^ silence for several
blocks, and then the woman addressed
a remark in a very low tone- to her
companion. He answered, and then
asked me the address of the nearest
Justice of the Peace. After I told him
he again turned to the woman, and for
at least five minutes they conversed in
very low tones. Just as the cab turned
into Larkin l street the young fellow,
with what sounded to me very much
like a curse, rapped on the cab win
dow and yelled to the driver to stop.
When the cab came to a standstill the
young fellow Jumped out, helped the
woman out and \ turning to me said,
â¢We have changed our minds.*"
.. "Some people do not know their own
minds for ; five minutes," said Cupid
Dan forth a few mornings ago as he
was . opening up the marriage license
office. As he spoke he yawned and
rubbed his eyes. "Come In," he said
to a newspaper man to whom he ad
dressed the remark, "and I'll tell "you
why I think so."
"Last night about midnight I was
awakened out of a sound sleep by a
ring at my doorbell. I got up, slipped
on a portion of my clothing and went
to the door. At the curb in front of the
house was a cab, and standing on the
doorstep was a young fellow. He asked
if I wa's Mr.' -Dahforth, and when' I
told him I was he wanted to know if It
were possible to get a marriage license
at that hour. \ I told him It was, and
asked him to wait a few moments until
I got dressed, when I would go to the
hall with him" and issue it. -In a few
minutes I was ready and stepped into
the cab.

country which cast an instructive light upon the position
our merchants hold in the commercial activities of the
southern republic. Consul Seeger's report would seem
to indicate that while the American commercial invasion
of Europe is in its heyday the commercial powers from
across the water are checkmating our trade expansion in
South America to a degree which is perilous to the
American manufacturer and the American ship owner.
According to the Consul's report the contract for har
bor improvements at Rio de Janeiro, involving the ex
penditure of $30,000,000, was awarded to a London firm
without competition. Official calls for bids to supply the
Government with coal for all its railroads and steam
ships have, until the recent protest of our Consul, speci
fied that only Cardiff will be accepted. A recent contract
for supplying Brazil with; a complete circulation of
nickel coins was awarded a German firm after the pro
posals had been posted in Rio and London only. Thus
Sceger's* report runs; every enterprise, either of a gov
ernmental or a private nature, is controlled almost en
tirely by German and English capital.
"There are various causes for the discrimination in fa
vor of English importers and contractors," says Seeger,
"and it is only just to say' that as far as the national ad
ministration is concerned there is not the least prejudice
against the, United- States and its industries. Brazil is
tea large degree financially dependent on England, and
as long as this powerful influence exists American com
petition here will be seriously handicapped."
.The report of 'our Consul General is but another ar
gument in favor of.' the passage of the ship subsidy bill
by Congress: If one wonder why it is that England and
Germany. are supreme in the Brazilian markets, as they
are in every 'other mart south of the Mexican border, he
has.'only to turnfto'the record of the merchant marine of
thbse-two; countries and compare that with the meager
showing i our ships, make upon, the seas to find an an
swer to his 'question. It was through their merchant ma
rine- that England and Germany first came into the rich
field of South American trade, and it is through their
merchant marine that they remain in undisputed posses
sion. The coming of their ships brought about the es
tablishment of the banks as a means of 'financing the
countries with which they were doing their trading and
added to their prestige in, the markets of the republics.
The United States, with scarcely the flag of one mer
chantman upon the lower Atlantic, was naturally out
stripped.
If the merchants of this country would have any voice
in affairs commercial in the Latin republics they can do
so only through the medium of American freight car
riers. The trade of South America is too valuable a
thing to lose entirely. What we have lost we can re
gain and add to by ever-increasing percentages through
the upbuilding of an American merchant marine.

From Budapest -in Hungary to La
hore in India is about 2400 miles in an
air line, and the stories make the Jour

the whole distance. The storks which
spend the summer in Central Europe
and the winter in Central Africa travel
with the same rapidity.
Slatin Pasha, an Austrian In the ser
vice of the Khedive and now Governor

No living thing, not even a scared

do these birds fly with a speed which

up their rapid flight for one or two
thousand miles at a stretch without ap
parently tiring.
Evidence has been collected recently
Vviiich shows that the bluethroat flies
from Central Africa to the shores of
the North Sea, a distance of 1C00 miles,
in less- than a day and a night, and

The storks, which spend their sum

The value of M. Dubois' discoveries
Js" now recognized by the French
Academy of Sciences, and great in
terest is taken in Ills investigations.â
Washington Sar.
Hitherto no :>earl oysters have ever
been "found In French oyster beds. En
. eouragefi by his success on the shore
.of Tunis, M. Dubois brought some
specimens of his pearl oysters to his
.laboratory in Lyons, and once more
the transplantation was successful.
"Living specimens containing small but
â¢fine pearls were exhibited a short
time since at the Academy of Sciences,
and as it has been found that oysters
increase rapidly in size in French wa
ters there is every hope that M. Du
bois' pearls will in time attain the di
mensions required for the article of
commerce.
â¢, For years past M. Dubois has de
voted him&elf to studying the nature
and habits of the pearl oyster and the
conditions under which the pearl of
commerce iÂ» formed. Having satisfied
himself that the pearl is the product
of a disease of the animal, he next
sought to. determine whether that dis
ease might not be contagious. AftÂ°r
numerous experiments his patience was
rewarded. He succeeded in communi
cating the disease so thoroughly that
almost every oyster in the bed under
observation, and every mussel even,
became affected, and pearls â small
ones, it is true, but of good color and
shape â were found In every shell.
At the International Fishery and
Agricultural Congress of 1900 M. Du
bois demonstrated the success of his
experiments to a commission of
savants. In the first stages of his ex
periments he had opened as many as
12,000 or 15,000 oysters before find
ing a single pearl; now any three
taken at haphazard showed pearls.
At the. conclusion of the congress the
CQlonial Office of France gave him a
commission which enabled him to
prosecute his inquiries under the most
favorable conditions, and he at once
repaired to Tunis, where he began a
series of experiments in acclimatizing
the Ceylon pearl oyster in the waters
of the Mediterranean. All M. Dubois*
experiments have been made upon the
oyster known as the "pintadine," from
the celebrated Ceylon beds. The ani
mal underwent some slight modi
fications on being transplanted from
the Indian Ocean to the Mediter
ranean, but they proved unimportant,
and the work of breeding the con
tamination proceeded without inter
ruption.
The demand for pearls is always far
in excess of the supply. The leading
jewelers of the Kue de la Paix say
that they could always dispose of more
than double the number they are able
to procure, and pearls are more in
vogue this year than ever before. The
invention of the French savant. Si.
Raphael Dubois. promises greatly to
augment the supply of pearls.

by enormously powerful electric en

LIKE many other great Christian holidays, Easter
is expressive â¢ of a thought and aspiration and
spirit of rejoicing that were in the world and;
among ancient men m ages before the day acquired its
present devout significance. The refinement of thought
and the faculty of observation have had their seat ', in
the temperate zone. There the four seasons *- are
acutely marked and the solstices and equinoxes, the
lapse of plant life into sleep in the fall and its resur
rection in the spring, are events of the deepest mate
rial significance to man. If no spring were to follow
the winter, then the sleep of plant life would be eternal
and that part of the human race dependent upon the
fruits of the soil would disappear from the face of the
earth. No wonder then that man devoutly celebrated
the # bursting of the buds and the^ return of verdure.
The observed resurrection of the fruitful possibilities
of the earth soon underwent an application to the state
of man. As some power brought bloom and fruit back
to life from the tomb of winter, why should not man
have a glorious resurrection and" a second life?. St.
Paul, in preaching the resurrection, made ample use of
the observed facts of renewal of life in the fields. This
was because the people to whom he preached, by long
custom were familiar with the change in the, vegetable
kingdom and had learned for ages to regard it with
feelings of awe and thankfulness.
Indeed, they had gone beyond that. The ancients, who
worshiped at the family hearth, on whicli the fire was
never quenched, had long believed in what they called
"the second life." . It was with them a confirmed and
positive faith. They believed that the influence of those
who had entered upon it was around the living, and so
they invoked their ancestors and looked upon the family
tomb as the abode of those who had entered upon the
second life. This belief was wrought into the civil polity
of the ancient nations and races. Rome was prepared
for the acceptance of Christianity by it, and the transition
was made easy by the Christian story of the resurrection.
So, from past ages, and a practice reaching beyond
the horizon of history, this season and its celebration
as a time of hope, renewed life and rejoicing came down
and has become the most firmly seated of modern Chris
tian traditions and celebrations. To-day many millions,
under the higher lights of Christianity, are joining many
other millions living in a lesser light in solemn and
cheerful observance of the great feast which has the
same significance for all.
It is remarkable that observation among the ancients
we call pagan caused the use of the egg as a symbol
of this season of the resurrection of life. h\ Christian
homes the children to-day expect the gayly colored
eggs, and art has wrought the egg form out of many
materials for Easter use. The pagans used the egg
to symbolize the source of life as St. Patrick used the
shamrock to' explain the Trinity. .?â¢
That was a far gone time, but modern science finds
the source of life just where the ancients found -itâ in
the egg, the cell. From cells proceed the life' of' man
and of other animals, and from cells the Jife^of plants
emerges, and by them is built up. If the egg ; failed, if
the cell perished, life would have no renewaVi'nb.resiir.-'
rection, and the influence of the vernal equinox .would
conjure with a barren world. . , '
To-day in every zone the story of the resurrection is
told, and music and ritual and high expression of human
hope lead the thoughts of men from the renewal of
material plenty and comfort upward to the unfailing
beneficence of the power that is the final cause of it all.
In all this there is not such a wide distance between
the materialist and the supernaturalist as seems upon
the surface. The experience of ages provides that neither
can put aside the impulse and lesson of the season. One
may sec in it only the" working of law that is mani
fested only in the unerring recurrence of its phenomena,
while the other explores the mysterious and seeks reve^
lation for the final cause of the law. But each is. com
pelled to reverence, in admitting that man is dependent
upon some system which he cannot create for himself,
but of which he is a part.
Philosophers and metaphysicians have not failed to
observe the long leading and prolonged preparation of
man for Christianity and the further progress which it
meant for the race. In every old system there were the
shreds and fibers of the new. It required one surpass
ing influence to weave these together into a fabric that
surpassed all of which they had been parts. This in
fluence came into the world and did its work, and in
the observance of this old and universal feast men are'
saluting it as the master fact in the life of the race.
English is now spoken by about 125.
000,000 people. A century ago It .was
spoken by 20.000,000 people only. Dur
ing that period no other leading Euro
pean language has made the slightest
advance. German has held its own,'
is spoken now by 80,000,000 people, but
this is no higher percentage of the
tctal number of the people of Euro
pean stocks than It had a century ago.
Abraham Lincoln foresaw 200,000,000
English-speaking people in the United
States alone, and later prophets have
described It as the home of 200.000.000
when the twentyrflrst century dawns.
.As "the learning of English is compul
sory in India, 300,000,000 more people
are being annexed to the English
speaking world.

It would be almost a physical im
possibility for a man to hide himself
in any remote corner of the world with
out being discovered at last by some
insignificant agent of the world's mail
service, the machinery of which ope
rates with clocklike regularity. If a
blrdseye view of the different railroad
and steamboat lines, which carry the
mails could be taken the giant spider's
web thus formed would appear woven
in a pattern so intricate that the mind
would balk at the mere suggestion of
unraveling it. And besides the regular
steamship and railroad threads of this
maze would appear tens of thousands
of cross lines, representing pony routes,
dog and sled tracks, swift courier and

nearly every invention of man for quick
transportation have been pressed into
the postal service, and it Is possible

a story of thrilling interest.

The details of the tunneling of the

in and about New York City, which will
be In keeping with the gigantic engi
neering project, have been made known
by the railroad company. The western
tunnels will connect with the Pennsyl
vania tracks at Harrison, near Newark,
N. J. The two tubes, which will be
placed thirty-seven feet apart, will
pass under Bergen Hill. " The tunnels
will be constructed in sections, the first
to extend to Weehawken shaft, a dis
tance of 5910 feet. The next section ex
tends from the shaft to the New York
State line, about the center of the
river. The distance from the shaft to
Ninth avenue. New York. Is 9257 feet.
With the exception of a small section
ol thirty-four-foot span, a section of
1096 feet of triple tunnel and a section
of 605 feet of four-track tunnel, these
sections consist of two individual tun
nels. The eastern division, from Ninth
avenue to Thomson avenue, Long Isl
and City, is 18,600 feet long."
The railroad company, in awarding
the contract, paid particular attention
to the specifications relative to the
making and quality of steel and iron
castings to be used in the work. The
specifications require that the cast
iron must contain not less than 1 per
cent of silicon, not more than six
tenths of 1 per cent of phosphorus and
not more than thirteen-hundredths of
1 per cent of sulphur. It is also spec
ified that no mill cinder, white or burnt
iron or scrap shall be used in the man
ufacture of the castings. The pitch,
into which the castings are to be
dipped while in a white heat,' will be
distilled from coal tar and must be free
from naphtha, and the material de
odorized by a solution of 6 per cent
linseed oil. The tunnels will be lined
with cast iron or steel plates flanged
and bolted together. â New York Press.

for anew football field dug out of the

bankment have been about abandoned
by the students of the University . of
California. A substitute not so ex
pensive has been devised to take the
place of the more ambitious scheme.
The revised plan calls merely for a
leveling off of the Hillegass tract,
which will be the site ot the perma
nent stadium, and the erection of tem
porary bleachers and grandstand.
This revision of the original plans was
necessary for several reasons. One of
these is that the time is too limited to
complete the excavation and building
of ; permanent bleachers upon the em

That there is 'some truth in the
adage "Every dog has his day" is ex
emplified by the Norris & Rowe show,
which opened a brief season yesterday
at Mechanics' Pavilion. In a few years
this enterprise has gradually developed
from one solitary performing dog to a
combined circus, museum, menagerie
and hippodrome, that covers almost
the entire floor of the big building on
Larkln street, and the canine features
are the least important of the lot. There
are highly educated horses and ponies
galore, performing seals and a large
and interesting collection of caged ani
mals, and the human element in the
exhibition is represented by gymnasts,
acrobats, equestrians _ and clowns, to
say nothing of the "freaks" that are to
be seen, in the sideshows and n<Jt -to
mention the hawkers and other con
ventional auxiliaries of the up-to-date
circus. For. .that's what the one dog
has grown intoâ a modern circus, vwlth
all the attractions thereof that adult
as well as younger amusement seekers
find irresistible.

stress upon this feature of modern improve

recommendations of last year and to suggest
to your honorable body that thÂ«s general health

demands that every precaution, no matter

The existing conditions In a great many of

concerned, are most deplorable, and we moat
urgently petition your honorable body to ap

The .Red Cross Society of Russia is

Whenever the fact comes to light
that some prudent old veteran has
saved a considerable sum of money he
Is surrounded by outsiders, who tell
him that he is being cheated at the
home and ought to take his money and
leave. Not lpng ago an old soldier who
came into an inheritance of $1200 from
Iowa was invited to make his perma
nent home at a saloon in Yountville,
where the kindest treatment would be
accorded to him. The old man accept
ed the invitation. He was treated so
kindly that when all of his little for
tune of $1200 had been expended for
liquor and on lewd associates the pro
prietor of the place hired a wagon to
have the old vet taken back to the
home, and sent a keeper along to roll
the sick and aged bankrupt from tfle
wagon to the steps of the command
ant's office.
Incidents of this kind are not rare.
The warm friends of the old soldier
have no fondness for him as companion

ELECTRO-CHEMISTRY PREVENTS
Mr. F. ( Christoffersen, a well-known shipowner and master
mariner, living at No. 333 Pennsylvania avenue, San Francisco,
tells in his- testimonial, which appears below, of his prompfcure
by Electro-Chemistry of a serious case of catarrh, which had at-
tacked his lungs and which was rapidly running him into consump-
tion. Before taking up the Electro-Chemic treatment Mr. Chris-
toffersen was for four months under the treatment of two other
well-known family doctors, and in spite of all these doctors could
do the patient gradually and steadily grew worse. The first Elec-
â¢ tro-Chemic treatment stopped the progress of his disease.

"that this defendant willfully permit
ted his wife to lead an immoral life
and lived on her earnings, and I see
no reason why he should not be
charged with felony. A detective
should be employed if necessaray to
secure evidence to justify the issuance
of a warrant on that charge and I
hope that the matter will be laid be
fore the Chief of Police."
Johnson was arrested for Ill-treat
ing his wife, who is much younger
than himself, and in defense of his
conduct he pleaded that she was a
wanton. This provoked I the woman to
tell the story . that prompted Judge
Mogan to suggest that the man be
charged with felony.
Michael Johnson must ansrwer a
charge of threatening to kill in addi
tion to the accusation of carrying a
concealed weapon and Judge Mogan
has requested the prosecuting officer
of his court to prepare and press
against the same defendant a charge
of allowing his wife to be an inmate
of an immoral house.

body, of H. Allaire, who '.; committed
suicide In Golden Gate, Park and whose
body was found among the sand dunes
last Friday. He found a Blight wound
back of the right ear, which had evi
dently been made by animals. There
were no other wounds on the body. The
stomach and contents were sent to the
city chemist.
A: H. . Pratt, general manager of the
Ipqultable Life Insurance Company,
called at the Morgue yesterday and re
ported that Allaire had been drinking
heavily for several days and that short

Pratt's name' to a check for $5 and had
it cashed by a special poliecman in
Oakland. He went to Frultvale on
Tuesday and collected on a note for
$100 from :J.' Beecher of that place and
appropriated the money to his own use.
When! Mr. Pratt learned of this last
transaction he swore to a warrant In
the Oakland Police Court for Allaire's
arrest on a charge' of forgery.
, The : widow of .; the unfortunate sui
cide called upon Deputy Coroner Mc-
Cormi'ck \ yesterday. She said that her
husband left his home in Frultvale last
Saturday, and she did not see him
again until Monday, when she went to
the Equitable. Life offices in Oakland.
She found him under the influence of
liquor and begged him to return home.
He promised to do so that evening, but
failed to keep his word, and that was
the last she saw of him alive.
Allaire's death was undoubtedly due
to morphine poisoning.

to reside with some friends at Red
Bluff, where she remained until her
mother sent. for her to return home.
This testimony was , corroborated In
part by the mother, who added - that a
few days after her daughter's disap
pearance SJ Waldsteln called j at her
house and stated that he believed the
girl had run away with another young
woman and that he knew where they
could be found. Then the case was
taken up by Detective Bralg, who
discovered the girl's whereabouts,
heard her story and arrested Wald
steln.
The defendant says the girl told him
she was 19 years of age and her. life"
at home was so Â¦ unhappy ' that .-. she
wanted to get away. So, prompted by

The prisoner, who. is .about 35 years
of age, was a picture of dejection as he
faced the bench. A night's solitary con
finement had evidently . been spent in
contemplation of the position. to which
his Jealous ; rage had led him. He had
nothing to say while In court.
Thomas Fallon,-*who shot and killed
his wife Friday evening in the woman's
"room at 949% Mission street, was ar
raigned In Judge Conlan's court and
his preliminary examination set for
April 9. Walter GallagheV appeared' as
his attorney.
Cooney Williams, colored, who is
charged with stealing a watch from a
man that was reading a war bulletin
posted In front of a newspaper ofllce,
was released by Judge Mogan on a
$1000 bond, the only proof, of theft
against the defendant being that he
pawned , the watch. He was given an
excellent character by Attorney. Por
ter Ashe and other persons by whom
he has been employed.
It is understood Williams' defense
will be that he was given the watch to
pawn by James Snow, a colored des
perado, who is now awaiting trial for
stealing a watch and fiercely fighting
the policemen that arrested him.

For selling a bass that did not exceed
one pound in weight, whereas, the legal
minimum is three pounds, Joseph Cape-
Iain was arrested by Officer J. C. In
galls of* the State Fish Commission and
arraigned before Judge Mogan.
"You did not catch the fish your
self?" Interrogatively remarked the
court.
"No," replied the defendant; "I
bought it."
"Well, to make this caie complete we
should have here the person from whom
the fish was purchased by this defend
ant," said the Judge to the officer.
"I will get him," was that function
ary's rejoinder.

"Ah, a repetition of the old, old
story." sighed Judge Cabaniss after he
had been informed of the ' accusation
against Frances Howard.
The woman was arrested and
charged with pety larceny on com
plaint of B. M. Sargent, a visitor from
the rural districts. He met her last
Friday evening in a Pacific-street
dance hall, wherein she is 1 employed,
and he alleges that she abstracted
from his pocket and concealed the,sum
of $10 without his consent
Miss H%ward reserved her defense
till to-morrow.
The -bold soldier boy was in a saloon
at Market and East streets when Car
ron snatched the chain and everything
fastened to it and ran away, closely
pursued by the complainant. Police
Corporal Egan stopped the fugitive
and charged him with grand larceny.
Carron bears none of the outer
marks of the typical criminal and
after noting, his honest-looking coun
tenance and respectable apparel Judge
Mogan continued the case until next
Thursday, by which time the police
expect to know for certain just who
the defendant Is.
William S. Searl, attached to the
Hospital Corps at the Presidio, places
a pecuniary value of $215 upon the
watch, chain and locket- he- alleges
were stolen from him by Ernest.Car
ron, and that estimate does, not cover
the sentimental side of the jewelry's
worth to its owner.
When they proceeded to uphold the
majesty of the law by laying on of
hands they found that they were con
fronted by a human wildcat, for An
derson struck, bit, clawed and snarled
in a feline manner as he resisted ar
rest. Finally, to accomplish his sub
jugation, the officers were compelled to
beat him upon the skull with their
clubs until their arms ached and he
was a sorry spectacle. When at last
he \ succumbed and was securely
manacled his captors considerately
took him to the City Hospital, where
his head was decorated as described in
the opening paragraph of this true
story. In the meantime other police
men conveyed Shuqulst and Engberg,
who were passive, to the City Prison.
Judge Mogan continued the hearing
until to-morrow, when the three de
fendants will describe the fracas from
their respective viewpoints.
The three defendants were engaged
in a discussion, when Shuquist said
something that displeased Anderson,
who thereupon struck' the bartender j
on the head w-ith a heavy beer glass. I
Then the tailor attempted to disarm !
Anderson, but he was struck by some â¢
one behind him and he promptly went j
down and out. In the meantime Shu- 1
quist was preparing to smite Anderson 1
in return, when the same beer glass }
collided with his cranium and he, too,
was out of the running. So the
doughty longshoreman was monarch
of all he surveyed until the policemen
entered and so elated was he by his
triumph that he laughed to scorn their
suggestion that he drop his weapon
and surrender.
Fred Anderson's head loomed In the |
prisoner's eagre of Mogan's court yes- â¢
terday as a horrible example of. what
strenuous resistance to police author- '
lty may lead to. The upper portion
of Mr. Anderson's â countenance was
swathed in a bandage and the lower'
section bore some abrasions that
served to convey a hint of .what the
bandage concealed. '
It was In a Howard-street saloon
that the job for the surgeon was pre
pared by the trusty clubs of two po
licemen, simultaneously, applied, and
with great f orce. t In the dock with
Mr. Anderson, who is a longshoreman,
were C. Shuqulst, bartender of the
saloon aforementioned, and Charles
Engberg, a tailor. Battery and dis
turbing the peace were charged
against all three and Police Sergeant
Wall and Patrolman Skelly told how j
it came to pass. *

GIRL WHOSE BODY WAS FOUND

[ IDENTIFIED IT.

The body was taken from the reser-
Kate Bessler chose the silent city
of the dead as a fit place in which to
end her existence and find eternal sur
cease from the sorrows that beset her
young life. Her dead body was found
floating on the placid waters of the
reservoir in Cypress Lawn Cemetery
early yesterday morning.
The mystery that surrounded the
disappearance of the unfortunate girl
on March 22 from the home of S.
Jesson, 1215 Lagnna street, whose
ward she was, has been cleared and
suspicions of foul play have been prac
tically dispelled. Within the ceme
tery where Kate Bessler ended her life
her remains are to be interred, to
gether with the secret of the motive
which prompted the rash act.
The discovery of the body was made
accidentally by W. E. Carre, one of
the assistant superintendents of the
cemetery. While walking through the
grounds near the reservoir, situated
about a quarter of a mile south of the
main entrance, > he was startted, to see
a body floating in the reservoir. Upon
coming nearer he found that It was
that of a woman, and the distorted
and swollen features, framed in a
wealth of auburn hair, were a ghastly
sight. Carre communicated with Su
perintendent McPherson and Coroner
Crowe of San Mateo County and the
San Francisco police were then noti
fied. The Justice of the Peace of the
township, E. E. Cunningham, ap
peared in the Coroner's stead and con
ducted the inquest.
SEEN BY A LITTLE GIRL.
A recess was taken at this juncture
to await the arrival of S. Jesson to
Identify/the . remains. He arrived in
company with Detective Coleman and
unhesitatingly declared the body to be
that of his ward, Kate Bessler.' He
was examined by Justice of the Peace
Cunningham and_ told of/ the disap
pearance . of . the deceased, from his
.house and the discovery of a note ad
dressed to him, asking him to request
her sister to call and get her belong
ings. He explained that she always
called him "grandpa," but-he was not
a relative. He -told of the/home life
of the girl and gave" it ; as his opinion
that too close attention to household
duties and study, had overtaxed her
physically and mentally. From him
it was learned that the deceased had
often visited the cemetery with Mrs.
Thompson, whose husband Is buried
there.; . .. - '..'-.. ..
The jury then retired jand returned
a verdict that the deceased had come
to her death from drowning and that
she. had taken her' own life while' suf
fering from mental depression.
Notwithstanding the verdict of the
jury,' it Is understood that Mr. Jesson
will have . an "autopsy performed to
ascertain the exact cause- of death.
From the evidence at 'hand the girl
left her home at 3f30 p. m. on Tues
day; March 22, and after j returning a
book ,-to the Public Library boarded a
car for the cemetery.

While the question concerning the
building was unsettled it was (difficult
to hasten the work of collecting - the
exhibits. That difficulty has .been
overcome: The building will .exactly;
accord "with the original plan*
Smith ". P. Gait, a prominent St.
Louis lawyer, has the ' proceedings in
hand. He, has advised the San Fran
cisco 'committee that Recovery ought
to be had on the bond furnished by
Schlueter when the original contract
was signed and that San Francisco
ought to be able also" to recover on ac
count' of the : damages resulting from
delay.' , . - .-- ''-:"'
" When all these facts were presented
to the San Francisco Board of Trade
Directors' A. A. Watklns, president of
the board, urged that the organization
stand by the committee. His vigorous
remarks were followed by the vote of
the directors to contribute $1000 to the
exhibition fund. The suit against
Schlueter will be pushed.
The fact is that at the end of the
period just before the exposition gates
are to open there is great demand for
buildings and it is difficult to get any
contractor to take in new work. The
New York' parties who have taken the
San Francisco contract have proceed
ed with great speed.
The next day after the .contract was
signed a force of men was at work
grading the site for the San Francisco
building. Two days later thirty car
penters were putting up the frame oC
the San Francisco structure, which
will be completed during the present
month.
When the first contract was let it
was supposed that as the majority of
the large buildings for the exposition
were practically completed there
would be a lull in the building-oper
ations on the exposition grounds and
also an accumulation of unused ma
terial and that both of these circum
stances would serve to make construc
tion from that time onward quick and
economical. .
Mr. King found that Schlueter
would n*qt do the work, even when an
advance of $1200 was offered above
the original contract price by San
Francisco. The sum of $13,000 would
not move Schlueter- and he said that
he would not do the work for less than
$18,000. Secretary King communi
cated with the executive and display
committees in San Francisco. When
it became apparent* that Schlueter
would not act new bids were adver
tised for "and a new contract was let
to Caldwell & Drake of New York
for $16,250, an advance of nearly
$5000 above the original contract
price.
- It is supposed that all the organiza
tions will now stand back of the com
mittee that the credit of the city may
be sustained by having everything at
St. Louis relating to San Francisco on
a good scale. The members of the
finance committee say that there is
urgent need of the aid of the public.
Real estate is principally benefited by
the growth of San Francisco. The ex
pectation is that realty owners will
aid the San Francisco exhibition at
St. Louis liberally.
The suit brought against Schlueter,
the Chicago contractor, is for $5100.
The papers were served on Schlueter
while L. M.\ King, secretary of the
general committee, was. in St. Louis.
The contract of Schlueter -with the
San Francisco committee for the enic
tion of the San Francisco building
made the price $11,800. T. C. Jud
kins awarded the contract and he
came home with the expectation that
the work would be started at once.
Schlueter, however, refused to carry
out the contract.. When. this happen
ed, as has already been exclusively re
ported in The Call, Secretary L. M.
King was instructed to go to SL Louis
and ascertain what could be done.
WOULD NOT DO WORK.
The San Francisco Supervisors ap
propriated $15,000 to cover the cost
of the San Francisco building. There
has been subscribed by citizens an ad
ditional $17,500. The San Francisco
Board of Trade has just voted to con
tribute $1000 to the fund. Five local
commercial bodies took part in the
formation of the general committee
that was intrusted with getting up a
creditable building and show for San
Francisco on the model street at the
SL Louis Exposition. These bodies
are the San Francisco Board of Trade,
the Merchants* Association, the Man
ufacturers* and Producers' Associa
tion, the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce^ and the Merchants' Ex
change. Each body named ten of its
members to make up the general com
mittee. 5
Two important matters concern the
committee that is providing a build
ing and exhibit for San Francisco at
the St. Louis Exposition. The first
is the urgent need for more, money,
the subscriptions, including the. sum
appropriated by the San Francisco
Supervisors, not coming* within $10,
000 of the mliftmum amount that is
necessary for success. The other mat
ter is a suit the committee ha3 begun
in St. Louis against the Chicago con
tractor, Henry W. Schlueter, who re
fused to carry out a contract that was
made by his agent, C. D. Wines, for
the construction of the San Francisco
building on the exDOsition grounds.
Local railroad men, who have been
speculating on what the future had
in store for B. A. Worthington, as
sistant to the general manager of the
Southern Pacific Company, now that
his chief has received an appointment
in Chicago, had their curiosity grat
ified yesterday. In the forenoon a
* ircular was issued by Director of
Maintenance and Operations Julius
Kru'ttschnitt announcing . that the
>Â©ung San Franciscan had been ap
pointed to the position of assistant di
rector of maintenance and operations
of the Harriman lines, with headquar
ters in Chicago. The promotion is one
that seldom falls to a young railroad
man, for in assuming his new posi
tion Worthinffton advances over the
heads of a number of E. H. Harri
man's most prominent officials, who
will now receive orders direct from
him.
As assistant director of maintenance
Worthington takes rank with E. O.
McCormick and Ben Campbell, the as
sistants of Traffic Director Stubbs in
Chicago, and will outrank the newly
appointed general managers of the
Southern Pacific, the Union Pacific
and the Oregon Short Line and the
Oregron Railroad and Navigation Com
j-any.
The circular announcing the ap
pointment states that Worthington
will devote his attention to questions
of through freight and passenger
schedules, assignment and distribution
of motive power and equipment "and
such other matters as may be assign
ed to him." Worthington does not ex
pect to leave here for about a month,
the plan being to have him remain
here until General Manager Mark
Â¦ ham becomes familiar with his new
duties.

from reliable sources is to the effect
that General Passenger Agent Francis

agent of the Northern Pacific Rail
road."

"Another point in connection with
the redemption of the bonds is that
the Board of Supervisors will be able
to apply the $25,000 heretofore appro
priated for interest and sinking fund
on the bonds to some other purpose.
That amount. will be available to re
pave accepted streets or for any
municipal betterment the board may
elect to consummate." ':>'-
-[ "There is one significant circum
stance connected with the redemption
of the park bonds," said . Mr. Mc-
Dougald. "Although the face value of
the bonds amounted to $250,000, the
actual sum paid out in interest at 6
per cent during the thirty yeara of
their existence aggregated the enor
mous total of $450,000. It cost the
city exactly $700,000 to issue the
bonds, or in other words it took
$700,000 to do $250,000 worth of con
struction work on Golden Gate Park.
City Treasurer McDougald yesterday
paid out an additional sum of $25,000
on the park improvement bonds of
1874, the redemption of which had
been fixed for April 1, 1904. Mc-
Dougald stated that the publication of
the article that the city was ready to
wipe out its only municipal debt was
welcome, reading to several banks and
private holders of the bonds, who had
quite overlooked .the fact that they
were now redeemable.
Mrs. Emma Ames and her husband,
A. H. Ames, filed a suit yesterday in
the United States District Court to re
cover 525,000 damages from the Cali
fornia and Oregon Steamship Company
for injuries alleged to have been re
ceived by her at the hands of Thomas
Davis, a waiter on the steamer Alli
ance, last October.
The complaint alleges that on Octo
ber 17 Mrs. Ames was outrageously as
saulted in her stateroom on board the
Alliance by Davis, an employe of the
company, and that she was so weak
from seasickness as to be unable to
defend herself against his attacks. It
is recited that on the preceding day
Mrs. Ames secured and paid' for a tirst
class cabin passage .from San Fran
cisco to Portland for herself and three
small children, the youngest being only
four months old, relying upon the as
surance given by the company "that
it would furnish care, protection and
attention and opportunity to retire to
the cabin at night in separate berths
under the protection and care of the
said steamship company and its serv
ants and employes."
After setting forth the circumstances
of the alleged assault by Davis, the
complaint charges the company with
negligently and carelessly failing to
furnish to Mrs. Ames proper care and
protection to her damage in the sum
named.
Bert Schlesinger filed the complaint
as attorney for Mr. and Mrs. Ames.
After the commission of the outrage,
as alleged by Mrs. Ames, Davis was
allowed *o leave th ; steamer at Eu
reka. She complained to the ship's
watchman shortly after the assault,
and said that no- heed was paid to her
story. *
Davis was arrested in San Francisco
several months afterward by United
States Secret Service Agent George W.
Hazen, the Federal authorities hav
ing detailed him for the purpose of ap
prehending the culprit. Davis had
shaved off his mustacne, which made
a material change in his appearance.
He was found frequenting a cheap
wine shop on Montgomery street. He
denied having committed the crime of
which he was accused and pleaded not
guilty yesterday morning in the United
States Circuit Court. His trial was set
for April 1L
If convicted, it will lie in the discre
tion of the jury whether Davis shall be
hanged or suffer life imprisonment.

been said and written In regard to
the non-publication. of the entries for

June 18.
â¢Th'e Washington Park Club and its

that it does not require any advertise

score was 1 to L Up to j the tenth
Inning it was an even thing. While the
champions hit Iberg more freely than
the visitors connected with Baum's
curves, they were, so well scattered that
nothing came of them after the third
inning. In the tenth, arter Freeman
had singled and had been forced out
at second by Francis, Steelman singled
to right field and Cravath allowed the
ball to roll between his feet and go to
the fence. Before he could recover it
Francis scored. A single by Iberg a
moment later won the game for the
northerners. Baum pitched first-class

Sea Air, a I 6 to \ Shot, Ridden by "Big Bill' 1 Knapp,
Noses Out George P. McNear for the- Gebhard.
The last biff steke event of the rac
ing season, the Orebhard handicap for
two-year-olds, decided over the Fu
turity course and worth' $2490 to the
winner, resulted- In a dazHlingr upset
yesterday at Oakland v track.
Sea Air, a daughter of Pirate of
Penzance, Â¦ carrying 105 pounds and
piloted by "Big Blir. Knapp, led from
the start, and In a fierce drive gained
a , nose decision over George P. Mo-
Near, a 20 to 1 shot, with See In the
saddle. Then third, one length and a
half back, Peggy O'Neil, : another de
spised outsider, ridden by Laraen, took
the short end of the stake. ' Pinker
ton, the black crack from Barney
Schrelber's stable and the public fa
vorite, finished next. â¢ .
Arisbe, the second" choice, which
Otis succeeded In getting: away from
the barrier last, ran sixth. '. V$'3-.
RAGE IS NOT TRUE RUN. ? ; ,
Unquestionably the condition of the
track had everything to do with the
result and It could not . be called a
true run race.
On the back stretch) the track next
the rail was slow and cuppy, -which
gave the starters drawing the outside
position a decided advantage.
The Schreiber pair,". Pinkerton ..and
Inspector Halpln, ruled "pronounced fa
vorites, notwithstanding the former car
ried 121 pounds. Arisbe, unfortunately,
drew the rail position, and at 5 to 1 had
second call. Ben Eric, Head Dance and
the'Blaslngame duo. Salable and Bose
Eley, were the best supported of the
others. Dick Dwyer sent the young
sters 'away nicely aligned, and almost
Immediately Sea Air and George P.
McNear, the two drawing the outside
positions, shot away In the lead. Bose
Eley. once edged McNear out of second
place, but could not hold it. McNear
stood a furious drive the last sixteenth,
but Sea Air was not lacking, in game
ness, and Knapp, riding one of his best
finishes, received the verdict. Peggy
O'Neil, after getting out of a pocket,
closed fast, taking show honors. Bo
land on Plnkerton was pocketed for
nearly an eighth of a mile on the- back
stretch. Arisbe never had a chance.
FIVE FAVORITES LOSE.
Although the weather was cloudy and
threatening there was an immense
crowd present. Five favorites were de
throned and the books reaped a har
vest, a raft of money being lost over
the downfall of Don Domo.
If Powell furnishes many more ready
made saddle effects like that on Jean
Gravler, favorite for the introductory
sprint, he will cease to b*e a favorite
with tfie common people. Whether it
was the fault of Powell or the black
horse may never be known. At any
rate, Jean performed wretchedly, and
to his rider was accorded the credit for

Stanford proved weak in its batting
department, being unable to solve
Heitmuller's elusive curves. The team
fielded well. Swain at third being one
of the brightest stars of the day.
Colbert scored the first run for
Stanford. He hit to Gillis at second.
The latter fumbled and then over
threw to first, Colbert reaching sec
ond in th'e confusion. Swain then
scored Colbert with a single over sec
ond. Tritch flew out and Heitmuller
retired the side by striking out Sales
and Williams. S 1 ,'
also strong with the stick, making a
hit on each of his four times at bat
and materially assisting Heitmuller
in his scoring.
President Wheeler and President
Jordan were present to cheer on their
boys. Each was given a hearty wel
come as he crossed the field. Thp old
familiar football yells and football
songs sounded out on the warm spring
air. but they lacked the zip and the
swing which is theirs in the crisp No
vember weather when the knights of
the gridiron have the field.
Graham made amends for his
errors by a brilliant double play, un
assisted, by which he retired the
Stanford men in the fourth Inning.
Captain Ball hit a hot one to Graham,
who made a clever stop. He touched
the bacr before Williams could return
and both men were out. Graham was
I in the first of the intercollegiate b'ase-
J ball matches with Stanford Heitmul
ler seemed to be playing the entire
: game for his team. A glance at the
| score shows he was a busy ball player,
every column, except that devoted to
errors, being decorated. He made
half the runs credited to the Berkeley
men, made a hit each time he came to
bat. struck out four men, put out two
and made two assists. Berkeley won
by a score of 6 runs to 2.
The Berkeley infield was as steady as a
rock in the preliminary practice games,
even with the professionals, but with
the responsibility of yesterday's match
on their shoulders they became badly
rattled at times. When they had the
Rime well in band they played snappy
ball. Glllis, at third base, is charged
with three errors, while Strub at sec
t id made two and Graham at first
two.

j terday afternoon at Recreation Park
I by actually bringing home a game
' against Oakland. It was a victory well
j earned, hard fought In every Inning,
and it ended after' an hour and twenty
live minutes of rapid-fire work. Score
i 2 to 0.
j Mr. Jones from Colorado Springs was
; allowed to exhibit himself on the slab
, for the first time so far. When he had
1 completed his day's work even the
I youngsters were willing to say, "You
Â¦ look like the best one that has blown
j Into the park so far. You're the real
kid."
Jones had a few concealed on his
person that kept the Oakland marks
men from shooting any bullseyes in the
fence. They binged him. and binged
j him hard sometimes, even to the tune
I of ten for the nine rounds, but when
| ever It was necessary to wallop the
I leather safely Mr. Jones either struck.
! out his man or compelled him to pro
duce a pop fly.
I He is a southwing-er, molded on the
lines of the mighty Waddell. Speed is
his and control in plenty. He is pos
sessed of an incurve that appears to
be the sauciest thing that a batsman
. ever nibbled at. If he repeats yester
j day's 1 doings the fans will learn to love'
j him.
I Buchanan, who twisted 'em for Loh
man, was in right himself. A glance
j at the score shows he allowed the
home gladiators Just three safe ones
! and passed but one man to first. He
was not lucky, for the pass he issued
i resulted in a run. Ho-is also a husky
â¢ lad and will' probably do something
1 ere many weeks.
FIELDING IS PERFECT.
! The fielding was perfect. No one
erred during the course of the battle.
It was quick and snappy from the call
of time, and the only sad incident was
the accident that happened to Tommy
Leahy. The game little catcher split a
finger in the eighth round and had to
. retire in favor of Hanson. He may be
I out of the going now for a week or
. more. i .
Charley Irwln prevented . the sub
urban tossers from tying up the score
by two phenomenal plays in the ninth
inning. With one man out and men on
first and second Dr. Moskiman was'
trotted out to take up Bottiger's bur
den at the bat. He lined one right be
hind the third bag. Irwin was there
with the big knockdown, and he
touched the bag before Streib and
forced him.
Nor did It end there, for Peter was
fighting desperately for that game.
Whitridge was called in to take a wal
l<5p at the ball in Buchanan's stead.
He caught it right on the plexus and
away it sped. It got as far as Irwln's
left mitt and stuck there, instead of
continuing all the way out to the left
field fence and becoming a two-bagger j
and perhaps breaking up the game. j
Waldron started it for Uncle in the ;
initial round with a two-bagger to cen
ter field, that Dunleavy reached only
with one mitt. Hildebrand came
through with a bunt, which advanced
Wallie. Meany slapped a lingering one
to Schafley. He figured on cutting off
Waldron as the latter tore to the rub
ber, but changed his mind and retired
Pat at first base, allowing the run to j
score.
LEAHY IS PASSED.
They landed, another in )the fifth
Leahy spt that fatal base on balls and
Massey sacrificed. Andy Anderson was
not lacking this time, for the sound of
his wallop to left field can yet be heard
echoing through the grounds. Leahy
kept right on coming and easily round- i
ed the final turn. ;
The Cripples made an awful stab in j
the eighth and all but landed. Ganley
drove it out to righf field. He lost no
time in stealing second on Hanson, j
Dunleavy came through with one of
those stingers of his. that always score
men. Ganley hot-footed lively and
slid for the plate. He looked safe
enough, but the umpire informed him
he was out. It was several minutes ere
Peter became reconciled to the decision.
Youngey Johnson made his bow as
an umpire, and his melody was great ,
to hear. He called the balls-. and j
strikes in such a falsetto voice "that all
the crowd tried to do likewise until
almost every one became hoarse.* The ;

I WILL PAY $1,000 FORFEIT
For a case of Nervous. Debility, Varicocele, Rheumatism, Lame Back, Lumbago, Sciatica, any case of Kidney Disease (that has not gone as far ss â¢
Bright's Disease), Indigestion, Constipation, or any weakness which I cannot cure with my new irrlproved Electric Belt, with electric suspensory for
meii (no charge), the'marvel of electricians, the most wonderful curative device that has ever been introduced.
Give me a man broken down from dissipation, hard work or worry, from any cause which has sapped his vitality. Let him follow my advice
for three months and I will make him as vigorous in every respect as any man of his age.
I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never intended by nature to be strong and vigorous. Even â¢ that man I can make
better than he is; but the man who has been strong and has lost his strength I can make as good as he ever was. :, -*:-.;
I can give back to any man what he has lost by violation of the laws of nature. ; I can stop all drains upon his vitality in ten days.
A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps badly; awakes more tired than when, he went to bed. who is easily dis-
couraged, inclined to brood over: imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and^energy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which
the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt supplies. Â¦ -.*..;
The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. .When you lose that by draining the system in any man-
ner my Belt will replace it and will cure vou. . . . .'Â¦ 'l-
Mr. Harry U. Jackson. Valleton. Cal.. writes October 1: "Although you are a stranger tÂ« me. my heart warm* toward you u a.rreat benefactor and friend, and I Â»ra morÂ»
than grateful to 3'ou. Already I feel thÂ« ..vigor rf new life In my body: no aches and no pains. I wleh you every success In your work."
'Â¦ Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from
' useless doctoring. I g$t such letters every day. . * % v . v '
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy in a man.
I make the best electrical body appliance in th; world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after
everything else has failed are my best arguments. .
Mr. Roy Burks, MrKlttrlck, Cal.'. write*:'. "From the first nlnht.I wore'the belt I felt new life In every part Â«f my body. The weaknea* wu checked Immediately, and I ara now-
able to do heavy work wtthout tlrlns;. I am jtled I thought of th<Â« bp]t,>for In no other way could the money bring me so much pleasure."
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or "joints, "come-and-go" pains in his shoulders, chest and side, Sciatica in
his hip. Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any ache or. pain, and my Belt will pour the oil. of life into his aching body and drive out every sign or pain.
No pain can exist where my Belt is worn. ..
Mr. J. L. Baird of Orland. Cal.,. writes October 13: "My back is entirely well, and 1 would, not take $100 for my belt if I could not rÂ«t another. It Is thÂ« best thin* on earth for
a lame back.'" ,.;â¢,..! t . . . Â¦â¢ Â¦
And these "old" men. these men who have burned the candle at both endsâ or even if they haven't â these men who for one reason or another
feel that life has lost its. spice, that they are getting o}d too fast. I can make them feel the sparkle and fire of youth again.
I'll never forget when MrT-A. Crawford of Pokegama. Oregon, an old man of seventy, wrote to me and said: "When I wrote to you last I told
you to send me a Belt to make an old man young; and you did. I am seventy years old. and since I have worn the Belt I feel as strong as I did at
thirty-five, and can do as good a day's, work as I could a: that age." It was two years ago that-Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here is one I
just got from him: L -'
"In reply to your letter I am glad to say that I am Just as m*ich In favor of your Belt as I ever was, for it has bÂ«en a remarkable help to me I am seventy-two years eld. tout
I do not look any more than fifty. Am enjoying perfect health, and will continue to recommend the Belt, as I have been doing rlnrht along, aa I realize that but for it I should have been
dead anfl burled by this time." Â¦ â¢ ' -
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in *he country which has not cures by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric
Belt. . t : ' V
Now, what does thisimean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you oujjht to.be. can you ask any better proof to make you try it? Is
there a remedy ,whlch*is< as simple,, as easy to use. as surc;to cure and as cheap .as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must,
try it. In justice toyourself, and to those who 'look -to you for their future happiness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not be
delayed. ' Â¦ . ' - \, :
It's as good for women as for men. Worn .while. you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle glowing heat from it constantly, but no
sting; no burning. As in'old-stylc belts. * '.'-'., '
Come and see me if you can. I have a private consulting room in which I will explain my method of treatment, and* perhaps, give you the
names of some of your" friends whom I have cured.' ; . /

The King's cipher Incident, which of
itself would be sufficient to make the
bl-elections at Dulwich and Lewis
ham memorable, Is, we fancy, not like
ly to be repeated by. Tariff Leaguers
at any future election.
The facts have already been given,
but they are .worth brief repetition.
Large placards were last week issued
on behalf of the Tory candidates, and
announcing at which they
and their supporters would' speak. The
placards were decorated by a life-size
presentment, ' of : Britannia, on .'.the
sleeve of whose robe were embroider-,
ed the words, "Eduardus Rex." Bri
tannia's hand rested on a shield em
blazoned-with the Union Jack, bearing
in the center, his Majesty's cipher. .
We were able \ yesterday, to state
authoritatively that the King had giv
en- no .sanction to : this action on the
part of the. eager Protectionist politi
cians, and that steps would be taken
to prevent its continuance.
ThlB is confirmed j by the following
telegram, dispatched from Buckingham
Palace' yesterday â¢ afternoon, addressed
to F. W. Soutter, Liberal Club, Penge:
"Inreply to your telegram, it Is al
most unnecessary for- me. to say that
no permission has been given to make

Prosecuting Attorney Leach was, out
of town this afternoon, so the war
rants will bo sworn out for the follow
ing scavengers Monday morning:, Â¦-.
In allowing the scavengers their free
dom, Inspector Gimmel acted upon the
.id vice of City Attorney McEhoy, who
thought It better not to place the men
under actual arrest until the warrants
had been issued.
Attorney J. H. Creeley, who repre
sents the scavengers In their fight
against the ordinance, 'said this even-
Ing:
"The ordinance"" under which - the
crematory Is going to do. business pro
vides that no~garbage shall be dump
ed within the city limits, and as the
incinerator can only, burn about 20
per cent of the garbage it collects, its
management must of necessity dump
nearly 30 per cent, thus violating the
very ordinance under" which it 1 seeks
protection.. If^.the ordinance were en-._
forced It would put both* the scaveri-*"
gers- and the = garbage-crematory out jof
business, leaving the people of this
city high and dry, with ho Way to dis
pose of the garbage.".....
Fifteen scavengers were arrested at
the dumps this morning, and as soon
as the warrants are issued they will
be haled Into court to answer to the
charges preferred by the. incinerating
company.
Despite \ the-, edict â¢ of the' Board of
Health ordering | that ' the | dumps
at ! West Oakland ; .be.^ closed: . on
and ..after April" : 1, in compli
ance with the new garbage. ordinance,
the ; Scavengers' . Union, "refusing 'to
comply with the ordinance, has decided
to fight the "matter out In the courts,"
and this morning the battle .between
the scavengers on.one side and the Pa
oiflc. Incinerating; Company, 'backedj by
the City Council an<i the . Board < of
Health on the other, opened in earnest.
The scavengers began 1 the collection
of garbage as usual this morning, and
about S o'clock the first of their wag
ons appeared at the old : dumping
ground. Sanitary Inspector f Gimmel,
who had been notified that the scaven
gers had decided not; to"! recognize the
ordinance, was en hand, reinforced by
two police officers, and as soon as one
of the scavengers had dumped a ioad
of garbage he was placed under arrest
and his name and address taken. None
of the men were detained, but were
allowed to go on their own recog
nizance until formal complaints could
be sworn out by the Pacific Inclnerat
!ng Company charging the scavengers
with violation of the garbage or
dinance.

In addition to this statement there
are other strong reasons why President
Wheeler would not accept the place.
The principal of these is that the Uni
versity of Illinois is not so well
equipped as the University of Califor
nia and is somewhat overshadowed by
the University of Chicago., bo that no
advantage would come to him through
such a change.
"All I 4cnow of the contemplated ac
tion of the Regents of the University
of Illinois is what I read in the morn
ing papers," said President Wheeler.
â¢â¢Therefore I do not wish to discuss the
Question of what I would do in case it
was offered to me. I do not want to be
put in the position of declining or ac
cepting positions that have not been of
fered to me.".
In view of President Wheeler's un
equivocal statement after his return
from the East last summer that he
intended to devote the rest of^hls life
to educational work in California, it is
unlikely that he would accept the pres
idency of Illinois. At that time it was
rumored that he would accept the Em
baBsadorship to Germany.
President Wheeler was interviewed
to-day regarding the dispatch from the
East to the effect that he is considered
a candidate for the presidency of the
University of Illinois, to fill the va
cancy caused by the resignation of
President A. S. Draper to accept the
office of State Commissioner of Educa
tion In New York. . Â»

Seaman, which was purchased at New Or
leans by the John D. Spreckels & Bros. Co..
and which arrived herÂ« Friday evening, docked
yesterday at Pacific-street wharf, where ehÂ«
attracted considerable attention. Fine weather
favored the Breakwater, throughout her long
patsare, except for a few days after emerg
ing on this side from the Straits. of Magellan.
In the heavy gale then encountered she proved
hervelf a splendid eea boat. Tne Breakwater"
was formerly engaged In the fruit trad*, run
ning out of New Orleans. In lines and gen
eral appearance she is quite yachtlike and
wilK be the smartest looking steamer engaged
In the coast trade. She will run between here
and Coos Bay, earning coal and passengers.
Some changes will have to be made to adapt
her for the trade in which she will be en
gaged and she will not be ready for service
fcr about a month. Her passenger accom
modations are particularly fine. She will carry
forty-five cabin and twenty steerage passen
gers and will offer them comforts not found
In any other coasting craft.
The Breakwater brought a cargo of young
alligators from New Orleans. It was a small
cargo, for the miniature monsters cumbered
only three. They were purchased In New
Orleans by F. R. Famuets of J. D. Spreckels
& Bros. Co. Mr. Samuels yesterday removed
two of his ugly pets to his home. One of
the two removed was much livelier than the
other and would not enter his barred cage
until Mr. Samuels had placed the obstrep
erous monster under a hypnotic spell. To do
this the Samuels forefinger was placed within
an inch cf the reptile's huge mouth and rap-
Idly twirled around the- alligator's gnarled
snout. . Mr. Samuels ehowed no fear of his
wild pet. which offered its master no harm,
but gradually sank into a ctupor, from which
a snap of the hypnotic finger later awoke it.
The. Steamer- City of Sydney sailed yester
day for' Panama and way ports with an as-
Borted merchandise cargo, valued at $07,172,

WORLD'S FAIR OFFICIAL. ART SERIES; [
A Bee^itiftil Reproduction, iri

Palace o^Transportahbn
: NEXT SUNDAYâ
i PALACE OF TRANSPORTATION.
â¢ In , 1803 the flatboat and the packhorse were about the only, means of transporta-
tion available in the vast domain ceded. by \ France to the United States. ; There are to-
day. 65,000 miles. of railways in this same territory, its rivers are traversed by many
fleets, its troljey lines are innumerable and it is second to no country on earth in its
facilities for transportation. â¢.
The wilderness of 1803, now the heart.of the great republic,, has invited all the
world to gather at its greatest city and join, in celebrating its centennial anniversary.
At this celebration modern methods of transportation will naturally be given promi- ! Â¦
-nent place, for without their potent assistance the Louisiana Purchase could nothave
, won . its . present proud position, could not have achieved its immense wealth and
power, could not have become a seat of empire in a single century.
. ' This commodious structure, unique in design and appearance, is admirably adapt-
ed to the purposes for which it is intended. It is rectangular, 525x1300 feet, cover-
ing nearly sixteen acres, ' and including over four miles of railroad track. No less
than 12,300,000 feet of lumber were used in its construction, and the architecture su-
; perbly conforms to the needs of the exhibits. â¢ ', : .-
All the exhibits will be on the ground floor, and in the main, building locomotives,
cars and all large railway exhibits will occupy a central position, and every known
method of transportation be appropriately shown. â¢ #
It will be seen that this picture is altogether different from other pictures of the
-Â¦ series, just as the Palace of Transportation .differs from -any other exhibit" palace. -
This difference gives the zest of variety and makes each picture the more highly ap-
preciated,' but the fact is that every person in the land ought to get EVERY PIC-
TURE and preserve an UNBROKEN "SERIES. ; I
. .Remember, there is no charge 4 for the pictures. . 1. ;Â¦

STATEMENT
Dr. Chas. K. Kolsraan
There seems to be a popular notion
that on account of a much more ex-
tensive equipment than my competi-
tors and the prestige afforded by my
extensive business, that my rates for
a cure of any ailment are proportion-
ately higher.
It is true that you can't get the best
results without using the best means,
but it is not true that it costs more
to flre a grun and hit the mark than
it does to miss it. My charges in
fact are lower than the lowest, and
ypu can deposit the money in any San
Francisco bank, to be paid when you
know a cure is perfect in every detail.
THE MANLY MAN
Has Muscular Strength* Keatal Ac-
tivity sad. Sexnal Power.
Â¦ If you are lacking in these essen-
tial elements of manhood come to my
office and consult me privately and
without cost. I ccn and will cite you
by permission to unnumbered cases
which I have cured safely, quickly
and permanently.
My cure for weak men makes the
blood rich and pure, the flesh firm,
itfi^ muscles, solid, and the nerves
strong end steady. It brfghtens the
brain by relieving it of all despond-
ency It stops every unnatural drain
and discharge, and gives perfect and
permanent power to the sexual or-
eans. In a v.ord. it. builds up the
nhvsical. mental and sexual man and
prepares him anew for the duties and
pleasures of sturdy manhood.
''â¢ I also cure to Ftay cured VARICO-
CELE. STRICTURE. SPECIFIC
BLOOD POISON and all reflex com-
plications and associate diseases and
weaknesses of men. To these mala-
dies alone I have earnestly devoted 17
of the best years of my life.
If you cannot call at my office,
write your symptoms fully. I have
the most perfect system of home
treatment known to medical science,

â by all means, the latter preferred.
Who will be there? Why. the smart

stunning matrons. And as to gown-
Ing, where, pray, can prettier gowns
and millinery be displayed than at a
garden party?
The clever maids who planned the
affair wisely made it a Saturday af

the universality of the "Office closes

As to attractions, there are to be
grab bags, fish ponds, marionettes and
all the other inanities that make up a

THE FUTURE REVEALED,

THE PRESENT ANALYZED
â¢ BY LIVINGSTONE.
428 Eddy st
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatises that
Is so eloctrlfylns the world to-day. HE IS
NO IMITATOR. His work Is upon original
lines: PURE THOUGHT. CLEAR VISION.
He TELLS YOU WHAT YOU DESIRE TO
KNOW, AND WORKS IN THE OPEN
LIGHT. AND IS AS CONSPICUOUS FOR
ITS WONDERFUL OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR ITS ORIGINAL EXPRESSION
Â¦ AND VIVID TRUTHFULNESS.
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test Is ot
little value when the mind is troubledâ you
need mere substantial aid and advice. This Is
Just whut PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives you
when you call on him for a flrst-class clalr-
woyant rcadln_. He asks you no questions,
but tells you what you wish to know. -
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. . You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the -cause of trouble and
.suggest the remedy.- Â¦

. CHICAGO^ April 2.â Before trading began '
to-day in wheat, news from across the sea was
Â¦Cant owing to foreign exchanges beingr closed.
About the only figures of any consequence
were these of Bradstreet's, showing small
world's shipments of wheat and flour. Under !
the influence of the decreased movement a '
firm tone prevailed at the opening, July being I
up %c to %c at 87Â»4C7S8c. The. market be
came Btlll stronger in sympathy with strength
la corn and oats. Shorts who did not care to \
carry lines over Sunday covered freely. Prices '
responded to the demand and advanced easily, i
July selling up to feSUc. Great preponder- i
ance of shipments over receipts of wheat at '
St. Louie and Kansas City was also a bull !
factor. Receipts at the two points amounted
to only 48.000 bushels and shipments to 363,000 ;
bushels. Toward the latter part of the session, ;
however, sentiment temporarily changed to the i
bear side. A reaction bad occurred in coarse j
grains which induced considerable selling of
wheat. Private crop reports gave Indications
of a fair yield, and this Information brought
out additional sales. Under this selling July
declined to 87%c. Tlie market rallied again
Just before the dwÂ«, a firm tone being mani
fested. Final figures on July were '4c up at
87%@K7%c. May sold between O5Â»4c and Od%c
closing at 06 Uc.
Sentiment in the corn pit was bullish, due
to renewed purchases by a big holder. Small
rectipU and an improvement in cash demand i
were additional factors. July closed at 53*ic.
a gain of %Â©%c. . .
The feature of trading In oats was covering
by local shorta. July closed He up at 39%c.
Provisions were strong on an active demand
for all products. The interest of trading cen
tered in pork, there being heavy buying In
that product, credited to Eastern traders. The
market closed strong with July pork up 17%c
lard 2VSÂ©5c higher, and ribs up 2J4c.

The circular of the San Joaquin Producers'
- Aeaociation of Stockton says:
â¢The season of 19O3-1JK)4 has been protper
*"Â©re, grower* have had large crops, and prices
kave ruled high. Since harvest there has been
a steady demand from most every State and
prints in Europe for California product*.
Stocks of produce and beans are llpht and thÂ«
new crops of lÂ»oi will come on a market that
Is comparatively cleaned up.
"POTATOES â The market 1* firm at quota.
ttens under a *tea6r demand. Mississippi
â¢ud Miekouri River points are still using Cali
fornia potatoes, which Is unusual at this time
.of the year. The East ha* experienced a hard
and dosed winter, which ha* prevented po
ts to shipments from the north. The conse
quence Is California potatoes are in demand
from the Southwestern States. Thi* large
trade ha* taken hundreds of cars, which h*s
reduced stocks to such Â«.n extent that the new
crops will cume Into a comparatively barren
market.
â¢i.xcÂ«Â»ive rain* will delay the new crop at
lent thirty days, and this, combined with
licnt vtocks and very !Â«rg* eeed demand, we
anticipate will make a much higher market a*
the Â»ea*on for old potatoes draws to a close
"ONIONSâ Sound stock at this time of the
j-ear U usually scarce, but large receipts of
Australian brown tand more coming) are sup
plylns the demand, and prices as quoted are
not expected to advance.
"BEANS â It Is reixjrtcd that Russia has
pet-chased on the Continent uf Europe enor
mous amounts of beans tor UUpment over
toe trans-Siberian Railway to the Far Eat>t.
California should have this trade, and would '
, heve It If Congress would take the matter up
and ineiat that food products, carried iu
American bottom* flo&tlnc the American flag, '
destined to Japaiwre or Russian ports, are nut
contraband ol war. Heavy buying on tb*
Continent ha* decreased imports of foreign '
be&ns at the Atlanttc seaboard, and It is re
ported that the etocks of foreign beans at New
York and Boston are C0.OO0 tacks less at the
present than at the same time in 1903. :
â¢The Eaeteru markets are up, and New (
York and Boston the past month have been
heavy buyer* of California white bean*. Mich
igan liaa bad a clo*'d winter, which has pre
vented chipping. This has permitted CsJlfor
ma shipper* to supply a very large territory
that usually is supplied by Michigan dealers. '
T*ie general situation Is quite bullish. Tlie i
vteadr shipping of California beans the past !
eixty da)Â« has decreared atocks and holders ;
ar* wr firm In tbelr views, and there ts nc â¢
dlrpositiem to let ro. The Be&n acreage In I
California for 1!KÂ»4 will be less than ltvt;j. due i
t<> floods in that section of the Stateâ the lei- :
erds of the San Joaquin and Sacramento riv
er* â which produce over &O i*r cent of thÂ» j
witlre crop of Wa*hinrtons, Pinks, liayrw anj i
Blackeyes. Tfce situation of colored beaiia. â¢
cspedallr Pink*. I* verry dtrons. as there are
not now on hand in the State more than 20.000 I
eacks. which is not more than enough to eup- '
ply the local demand between now and Octo
ber I- Texas. New Mexico and Arizona arc
lnrre ectisumer* of California Pink beans.
Tr.iF demand alone will force the price of
Pink* before* the crop of J&04 will be ready
for mtrkft (about October 15. 1904) to a figure
Â»>eyond any ever recorded. Look out for 4-cent
Pinks. The stocks of Blackeyes north of Ven
tura ts less than 7000 sacks, which are light

BARLEY â Business was slack yesterday ami
the market for cash grain was a fraction off.
Futures showed no particular' change.
The steamer Coptic took out for Japan yes
terday JUS30 tons barley, valued at $11,735.
The shipment was part of tho 10,000 tons pur
chared by the Japanese Govornment some tlmo
ago. The balance will be shipped by the Brit
ish steamer Missouri early this week.
"It was a much quieter market with very
little outside business and small local trade.
The feature of the day was the crop j news.
'â¢ he Modern Miller was bearish and notes a
general Improvement In crop advices, which is
rather confirmed by , current commercial re
port*. Snow was out jwlth an estimate of crop
condition of W>. This would be a low condition
for April. The Government crop reports "\for
fourteen years show only four years as low
as this. The whole situation on wheat Is one
of uncertainty. . The crop Is not getting any
too good a start and needs weather of the
most favorable kind. The very moderate
stocks of cash wheat are strongly held every
where and tho moderate demand of cash wheat
has to pay higher prices and bid premiums.
On the other hand, the mills are having a
very poor demand for flour and the indica
tions are that dealers and distributors In flour
loaded up heavily on the war. and a,rc not
likely to be In the market to any large extent
for some time to come. As we approach a
new crop, with the futures strong, both millers
and buyers of flour will be likely to run from
hand to mouth to get the I advantage of the
low prices of the futures. With the'Improv
ing tendency of the crop, the situation, the
movement from first hands* should al?o in
crease. The Government crop report comes in
ten days and should be bullish, but It is a
question whether, it. will be as low as Snow's.
It Is a little too f-oon. to sell wheat short, but
our own feeling is that we would only. buy it
on breaks 'and for moderate profits." Â¦
There" was -nothing new in this market and
all quotations remained about the same.
A full cargp has cleared for Europe, the ship
Travancore taking out. 71,721 ctls, valued at
$100,400.

The agreement entered into between

In the new demands the carmen
insist that the. company shall at all
times treat directly with the officers
of the union, both In the matter of
grievances arising through the opera
tion of the proposed contract and in
the case of complaints affecting any
member of the union. The proposed
agreement provides a method whereby
action on grievances or complaints
may be taken jointly by company and
union.
Tbe San Francisco public is well advised as
to the number, of concessions already made by
this company to secure industrial peace and
to avoid public inconvenience. The award of
the arbitrators, riving the laet Increase, is only
t. few months old to-day. I do not care to

tract under which the union would
like the company to run its business

eral Manager Chapman refused to
discuss the company's probable action
on the men's demands, but holds forth
little hope that the'union's new sched
ule will be adopted: He said:
;. ."Resolved; That we express our.keen
appreciation to - his â¢ * honor, , : Mayor
Schmitz, for the noble, stand taken by
him in his veto of the rock quarry and
rock-crushing ordinance." ;
"Whereas, Such "a proposition, Â«." suc

scheme was wisely, checked > in time
by the Chief Executive of our -mu

The demands are for higher pay. and
less hours and union recognition, and
unless granted a walkout will be ; or
dered. Committees from employers and
the unions have been attempting a
compromise, but thus far without suc

that the demands j of the electricians
are impossible to grant and are busy
with arrangements for meeting the
threatened crisis.
A new schedule of wages and rates
that has been adopted by the Hack
