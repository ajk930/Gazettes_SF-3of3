NEW YORK, Dec. 26.â For three and a
half hours to-day the members of the
house-cleaning committee jof the New
York Life Insurance Company had Presi
dent John A. McCall . before them while
they went over the report made by An
drew Hamilton, which was brought to
this country from Paris on Saturday by
young John C. McCall. The following
are the main features of the report: (
Firstâ Hamilton admits that he may
owe the New York Life money, and that
his account with the company is "open,"
because of his failure to render a state
ment heretofore of all moneys he has re
ceived.
Secondâ He offers to place in escrow
$100,000 cash from his own private funds,
pending a final adjustment of his account.
Any sum which it may be decided he
owes the company is to be paid to the
New York Life out of the $100,000 fund.
Thirdâ The Hamilton report is not' a
specific financial accounting/ He does not
give detailed facts about all the moneys
he received from the company or about
the payments he-made.
Fourthâ Hamilton does- not give names
or reveal the identity of the persons to
whom he made payments. . : . ,
BRIBES FOR LEGISLATORS.
j Fifthâ Hamilton asserts that, in con
nection with legislation in the Interest of
the New York Life," it was necessary for
him to make uayments to persons who
were not lawyers and that under no cir
cumstances would he reveal the names of
those persons. This was interpreted as
an 'admission that payments were made
to legislators or, to go-betweens who rep
resented members of the Legislature.
Sixthâ The report consists chiefly of
presentations of reasons for the immense
payments which Hamilton alleges he
made out of the funds given to him by
President McCall. \
Because of the absence .of details the
house-cleaning committee summoned Mc-
Call to attend its meeting and r explain,
if possible, many gaps in the Hamilton
report. After the meeting there were
two conflicting reports of the attitude of
the commitee toward " McCall and the
Hamilton statement. One report had it
that the committee was not at all pleased
wlth_jjie Hamilton statement and kept
McCall on the grill for more than three
hours. The other was to the effect that
McCall was not treated in a hostile way"
by the committee and that it was very
well pleased with Hamilton's statement.
COMMITTEE XOT CHEERFUL.
If McCall had been grilled by the house
cleaning committee he showed no evi
dences of it. He was smiling and seem
ingly In fine spirits. He showed not the
slightest trace of his recent illness. The
house-cleaning committee, or some of its
members, did not appear to be so happy
when they left for their homes. Chair
man Fowler seemed disgruntled. He
would say only:'
"I cannot discuss Mr. Hamilton's re
port. I do not know when his report will
be presented to the Armstrong commit
tee. I have no knowledge on that sub->
ject whatever." -
President McCall said the Hamilton re
port probably would be handed to the
Armstrong committee to-morrow, but
possibly not until Thursday. .

MITCHELL'S BUCKET-SHOP METHODS
COST HIS PATRONS $100,000.
\u25a0R. Brent Mitchell 's operations as a broker at 28 and JO New Montgomery street have resulted
disastrously to his patrons, who intrusted to Mitchell their money to be invested in bonds and stocks.
The coin is not in sight and the securities are not forthcoming. The losses are in six figures.
Former Lawyer Fails and His Doors Are
Now Closed as a Result of Bad
Business Principles. ,
Books Fail to Show All Facts About the
Financial Dealings and Receiver
Will Probably "Take Charge.
Stock speculators who have had
dealings with R. Brent Mitchell, stock
broker, at 28 New/ Montgomery street,
stand to lose, collectively, not less than
$100,000. Possibly the total loss may be
larger than that. The books appear to
be in such shape. that they convey no
accurate understanding of the assets
that Mitchell may have.
; The doors of the brokerage offices
were closed yesterday when Attorney
John A. Percy informed the creditors
that .Mitchell' was unable to meet his
obligations. Mitchell had not assigned
for the benefit of- his creditors. He
simply told his" friends /thaf.he could
not meet his liabilities.' Then Mr.
Percy, who was formerly associated
with him as a law partner, gave notice
to the creditors in the brokerage offices
on New Montgomery street. -
Then ensued much excitement. Only
a part of the creditors were present.
That Mitchell was in a bad way, finan
cially had been known to some for sev
eral days. Some of these dropped in to
see how things were going. When they
were notified, on authority of Mitchell,
through his attorney,- that the end of
his brokerage career, had arrived many
bitter words were said. Charles" Clark,
the bookkeeper, who had gone v away
earlier in - thÂ«. day, leaving the keys
with Attorney Percy, 'was summoned
by telephone. â¢;:\u25a0 . . . \;-, ; ..." ; >â¢
When he -arrived he said, plainly, that
Mitchell had been .engaged In
-lng::_re<:ently.. .. This J^eans^that .when
sums of money wereÂ«put -ifcUi* broker's
hands to be sent East for investment
in certain stocks they, were; deposited
in the office safe or "elsewhere and the
broker took .chances, on. the market.
These chances went wrong and Mitch
ell was swamped.j The gathered cred
itors held a preliminary .meeting after
hearing this statement. James White
ly presided.. Attorney Percy was pres
ent. The bookkeeper was instructed to
make up a statement from the books
to be submitted at a meeting to be held
this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
BOOKS IN BAD SHAPE.
A"t the prescribed time a meeting will
take place, but there will be no com
plete statement. This was admitted by
Attorney Percy last evening. Percy
said that Clark, the bookkeeper, had
reported that the finances were attend
ed to by Mitchell., The money items
did not appear on the books. As a re
sult there was no immediate way to
learn' just how matters stood. Attorney
Percy believes that the creditors will
lose $100,000. When he was asked di
rectly it the amount might not be
larger; he said that he thought not. He
also said that he had no personal
knowledge of the business of Mitchell.
Probably at a meeting of the credit
ors to be held to-day steps will be
taken to have a receiver appointed to
take charge. An attempt will be made
to' have Mitchell present to explain to
his creditors. All day yesterday Mitch
ell was absent from his place of busi
ness. His attorney, and members of his
family said that he was utterly pros
trated and that he was confined to his
home on Pacific avenue, where he
could not see newspaper reporters or
make any statement.
James Whitoly, 'who presided at the
meeting of the creditors, said last even
ing that he had been, so far, unable to
"make head or tail" of Mitchell's af
fairs owing: to the condition of -the
books. Whitely is a creditor to some
amount, but declined to say how much.
Mitchell carried an account with a bro
kerage business with which Whitely
is , connected. About all that was de
cided by the creditors yesterday was
that stocks and bonds that Mitchell has
on hand 1 shall -be sold at the closing
prices of \u25a0 yesterday ; for the, benefit l of
those to whom he is Indebted and that
Mitchell shall give the power of attor
ney to his attorney or some other per
son to sign the transfers. .
BANK NOT INVOLVED.
A story was in circulation yesterday
that the Crocker- Wool worth National
Bank was one of Mitchell's: creditors.
He carried his account principally with
this bank. Last evening Cashier Wel
lington Gregg denied ; positively that
Mitchell; owed anything to the bank.
"On the contrary," said Mr. ;_ Gregg,
'"there is a small balance here to his
credit. I -cannot give the figures, but
the 'balancer is not large."
Mitchell probably \ first exhausted his
own resources before he engaged' in
bucketing. He was on the wrong side
of; the market. Losing heavily, he be
came desperate and took chances -with
the bucketing process. > When , he en
gaged. in ; the brokerage business ex
clusively he had a large sum of money.
From the Fair" estate "he had & fee ,'of
$80,000." It is reported: that while *he
was engaged in the ; practice of : law \u25a0he
made at least $60,000 ,by, speculating in
stocks, , which, added" to the fee that -he
had f rom the Fair .estate, and other
moneys, gave him: a strong financial
start.- , '\u25a0' . ; \u25a0\u25a0 '\u25a0 ''.\u25a0.\u25a0"\u25a0\u25a0.:\u25a0-.-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 -.. â¢ ' V -
He opened his .offices, in Mho Palace
Hotel \u25a0; block "and t f urnished them. sump r
tuously. . ; Sometimes I .he . was ; largely
ahead of the game while; ho was In, the
brokerage business;, on New Montgom
ery street.' ; Then' he ?;' had hard luck

was v ingratiating : and he j had/ a * large

served â¢ to -draw to â¢ him r speculators,' >.who
eagerly p'utithelr'dplllars :in|hlsjhands
for .^investment : in \ the ; stock ' market. >,
During the^ last week the real <situa-
tlon dawned upon some of Mitchell's
creditors and they demanded '. either
their money or^the stocks or bonds for
which their money was supposed to
be invested. Mitchell was evidently
troubled and. his face became anxious
and haggard. He went along as far
as he could, however. Then he called
Attorney Percy .and told him the gen
eral facts, the main one of which was
that his t business had collapsed. The
impression received by.^Mr. Percy was,
so he says, that Mitchell has nothing
left. That will be inquired into when
the creditors meet to-day. With the
appointment of â¢ a receiver the first
step will be taken for an accounting.
Last night the books were in Mitch
ell's office and not directly In the cus
tody of the creditors.
CREDITORS AHE SUV.
The reluctance of business men to
admit that they are dabbling in the
stock market led to a general denial'
when questions were asked as to whom
the creditors were.. /- Attorney Percy
would not . give out,,' any names. He
Â«aid that lie had merely glanced [ over
the" books.. He thought that the out
side limit of any creditor's claim
would prove -not to' be in excess of
$10,000. , â¢";
â¢ Bookkeeper Clark says that he

thinks that Mitchell has nothing left.
Mitchell really failed some time- ago.
He then went on with a bucket, shop
business. In some Instances he had
to produce: within a certain time the
stocks or bonds from the East. Tha
system left his creditors with very
little to - show to their credit.: They
are injured to about all they have put
in so far as the facts have developed.
/When Mitchell retired from the law
ho took into partnership in the
stock brokerage ...- business- Richard E.
Mulcahy. This partnership was dis
solved something more than a year
ago.
Stocks s have had an upward tend
ency \ lately. That was In favor ot
speculators on -the right aide. Mitohell
was probably short to a large amount .

William M. Pierson and both made
money. Mitchell: left the â¢ law and
started the brokerage, business on a
simple : commission basis. If he had
adhered : to that plan he might have
succeeded.
Last .evening word was received
from Mitohell's- residence In' response
to a query- whether he would make a
statement that he was unable to so do
because of the' condition of his health.
It was. also added that possibly a
statement would be made for Mitchell

velt Intends to promot? Captain John J.
Pershinff of the Fifteenth Cavalry, whosa
borne is in Chicago, to a brigadier gen

heads of several hundred officers and gtvÂ»
an . example of advancement by "selec
tion" which has no parallel In army an

Leonard Wood and Albert I* Mill*, whose,
promotions caused a flrÂ» \u25a0of criticism.
Captain Farthing is a good offlcar md
his record of achievement In the Philip
pine Islands attracted the- attention of the
President. It was rumored a year aÂ«o
that a promotion was awaiting the- Chi

held up for so long a time the nomina

would mean tha Ijjnorinjr of all veterans
and hard fighters of three ranks Inter

that of brigadier general.
In a recent dispatch -attention was
called to the fact that the Senate com
mitte on military affairs had three new
members, each of whom could be counted
upon to sanction any name the. President
might present for promotion. If Captain
Pershing's name be sent to the Senate,
the newly constituted committee un

the fact that Senator Warren, th* new

DoubaSsoff, Governor General of Moscow,
saying that the revolt there had failed,
thkt the military had the situation In
hand and that whatever disaffection may
have existed among the troops had been
overcome by attacks on them with bombs
end revolvers; to which they had been
tub je: ted from the windows and roofs
of houses, and which had so enraged
them that they could hardly be re-
Btrained.
Although the rebellion may flare up im
mediately elsewhere and although there
Is an indication of an upheaval at Odessa,
if the attempt at armed rebellion in Mos
cow should be crushed the leaders of the
"reds" will receive a blow from which
thry cannot quickly recover.
Count de Witte is not so bllnu as to be
lieve that the revolution can be stamped
out. but with the present demonstration
of the lengths to which the revolutionists
will attempt to go he hopes that the mod
erates of ail classes will come to their
si rises and aid in counseling order and in
accelerating the convocation of the
Douma, the law governing the elections
to which was published to-day.
ItCBKL LEADERS CAPTURED.
Among the developments -here to-day
the most important was the capture of
the leaders of the "Fighting Legions,"
which it is believed ends the danger of an
attempt at an armed uprising in St.
'Petersburg. This capture, it is under
stood, places in the hands of the Govern
ment complete Information regarding rev
olutionary plans and the places where
arms are concealed, as well as disclosing
the weak spots in the army.
Police and troops surrounded and cap
tured all the members of the executive
committee while they were discussing
plans for an armed rising here. They
captured also the detailed "plans for the
rising, as well as large quantltes of arms,
bombs, etc. A man imed Schoolman
was at the head of the executive com
mittee, which numbered forty-seven mem
bers.
Shortly before 9 o'clock to-night a press
correspondent in Moscow telephoned that
there seemed to be no longer doubt that
the insurrection was collapsing. The in
surgents still held the Quadrangle, in
which the Workmen's Council was sitting
as a revolutionary committee, but only
-because Governor General Doubassoff
was not yet ready to give the coup de
grace. Firing continued intermittently
throughout the day. At 5 o'clock auto
matic guns were being used in Strastner
-square, but the Insurgents were becoming
"exhausted after their four days' efforts
and the fighting was rapidly degenerating
Into guerrilla warfare. The insurgents
\u25a0were defending'themselves with revolvers
and bombs as they were being hunted
down from house to house.
MOSCOW WOIIKMEX FLEEING.
â¢ The correspondent said that the entire
.population of the city was terror-stricken
and that after dark the back streets pre
sented a weird and uncanny appearance.
As he drove to the telephone station he
Eaw only a few civilians, who were' slink
ing along by the side of the walls so as
to avoid the police and cavalry patrols,
who fired without challenging. The win
dows of the houses were stuffed with
mattresses and blankets and no lights
were shown. The police carried rifles,
with bayonets fixed.
General Doubassoff was enforcing
the most rigid martial law and no per
son was allowed on -the streets after 9
o'clock at night. About one-third of
the workmen had left the city and
were traveling on foot to the villages,
somÂ« of which are hundreds of miles
distant.
Among the lower classes, which do
not sympathize with the desire to
overthrow the Emperor, the feeling
was becoming intense and in many
cases strikers had been beaten to
death. The correspondent predicted
that the crushing of the rebellion was
likely to be followed by the most hor
rible atrocities if the "Black Hundred "
were let loose. - â -

ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 26.â A press
correspondent, telephoning from Moscow,
says that he saw the patrols "firing every
time the people gathered in groups. In
the Strastonol boulevard he saw three
volleys fired and a dozen persons fall,
while the remainder fled. He met a
dozen Improvised Red Cross wagons
bringing in "dead or wounded, for whom
there was no longer a place in the
morgues or, hospitals, necessitating the
temporary Ã¼Ãe of residences.
All over the city there are marks of the
battle which has raged in the streets for
three days, and the distant booming of
cannon shows that the fighting is not yet
at an end. Houses have been completely
demolished by the artillery . and every
where windows have been smashed by
bullets. Governor Doubassoff has pro
hibited the opening of windows.
The better classes are afraid to ven
ture on the streets, owing to the fact
that numerous bombs and other deadly
missiles are being thrown from the win
dows cr roofs of houses.
Near the triumphal arch could be seen
to-t 1 the red flags of the Insurgents
flyi. Ã¼bove their barricades.
Sojiiers surrounded the Continental Ho
tel and artillery was brought up, as it
was claimed that a shot .had been fired
from one of the windows. It was with
difficulty that the landlord persuaded the
troops not to demolish the building.
As t the correspondent entered the tele
phone exchange a few minutes ago he
saw two agitators shot by a passing pa
trol. Artillery could be heard at work
near the Nicholas station.
Two attempts on the life of the Prefect
of Police by Btudents, one of them a' wo
man, were frustrated. The students were
arrested.

SEEMS ON VERGE
OF A COLLAPSE
Failure of Moscow Rising a Hard Blow
to the Leaders of the Revo
lutionary Movement.
MOB NO MATCH FOR THE TROOPS
( ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 26.â From the
standpoint of the Government there was
a Blight improvement in the outlook this
afternoon. Notwithstanding the decision
of the Workmen's Council to continue the
strike, many of the strikers broke-away,
Including about one-third of the Employes
of the^ Putiloff works, several hundreds
in* diheffactories arid portions of the mill
men.- It Is evident- that the leaders must
precipitato matters or the strike will go
tb pieces. From the standpoint of the
leaders all now depends on the situation
at Moscow.
A telephone message just received from
Moscow says the righting in the streets
continued throughout the day, but the
populace is not participating and the
troops are gradually getting the upper
hand. The soldiers are hemming In the
main body of the insurgents in the quad
rilateral â¢ near the Brest railroad station
bounded by Tverskaia street and the
Tverskol, Sadovia and Bronnia boule
vards. In this quadrilateral the insur
gents have fortified every inch of > their
lines with felled trees, telegraph poles
and street cars, in front of which they
have constructed a network of entangle
ments. Artillery is being used mercilessly.
TROOPS. RETURX TO THECOLOHS.
Two of the four grenadier regiments
have returned to duty and are fighting
on the side of the Government. Troops
also have arrived from St. Petersburg.
â¢ The fires which destroyed the Brest,
railroad station and other places last
night have been practically extinguished,
and the danger of destruction of the city
by fire seems to be over for the present.
An official dispatch from Moscow says:
"At every point the troops have easily
been victorious. Fighting, in which quick
firing guns and other artillery were used,
progressed for two hours on December
23. The casualties of the insurgents are
said to have been heavy. On Saturday
night and Sunday morning the city was
quiet. On Sunday forenoon, however, the
artillery was again active at tha Brest
railroad station. The inner town is per

STUDENTS FORM REBEL. ARMY.
The Slovo to-day says that the leaders
of the revolutionary army at Moscow are
mostly students of Kieff, Kharkoff and
Odessa, among whom are many Jews.
The military hold the center of Moscow
and apparently are awaiting reinforce
ments, which are reported to be on the
way to Moscow from all directions, some
of the troops marching overland. "\u25a0 \u25a0 :
::Four regiments of dragoons from War
saw * have started \u25a0 bya rail for Moscow,
but have not yet arrived there. The
Government is finding great difficulty in
dispatching a sufficient force to the dis
turbed city, it being dangerous to with
draw the troops from other places, most
of the available men having already been
sent to cope with . the* revolt in the Baltic
provinces.
The revolutionists hold the outskirts
of Moscow. A thousand men are working
night and day at the barricades, some of
which are - described as marvels of
strength. Trenches have been dug and
wire entanglements have been erected in
front of the defenses, which extend for
blocks and are impenetrable, even against
artillery.
HUNDREDS PERISH IX FIRE.
A terrible holocaust occurred !at the
Sytln Works, where 6000 workmen were
suddenly surrounded by cavalry and artil
lery. The latter fired at the building,
which was soon In flames. Hundreds per
ished in the conflagration.
It is definitely established that the revo
lutionists have six automatic guns.
Governor General Doubassoff has taken
rigorous measures to discover concealed
arms, holding owners of houses responsi
ble and ordering the confiscation of all
property where the presence of arms or
bombs is disclosed.
The gates of? the Tartar City, which
surrounds the Kremlin of Moscow, where
millions in church treasure is stored, have
been closed and' troops and machine guns
have been stationed on the walls.
Prince Tcherbatoff's "Black â¢ Hundred"

revolution be crushed.
Even the banks in the heart of Moscow

HOSPITALS ARE OVERFLOWING i
Yesterday's fighting at Moscow oc
curred mestly at some distance from the
center of the city. The revolutionists
abandoned the Tverskaia thoroughfare;
as it is too easily swept by artillery, and
concentrated their forces In the narrow,
winding streets of : the commercial quar

Speaker of the House of the
Opinion That Country Is
Not Going to the Dogs
BETTER THAN BEFORE
"Uncle Joe" 'Declares Nation
,1s Healthier Than in the
Old Days of the Republic
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.â Speaker
Cannon was one of the callers at the
White House to-day. , He desired sim
ply to pay his Christmas. greetings to
the President, but was obliged to defer
them, as the President had gone to the
country for a long horseback ride.
The Speaker was in excellent spirits
and talked wit.h.hls newspaper friends
in a characteristic way. He said:
They say things are not now like they were
In the old days; that we are becoming aristo
crats; that there is no longer honesty in legis
lative bodies; that there is no ability at the
bar; that we are liable to become a monarchy;
that some strong man is liable to rise up and
dominate everybody.
But I say that there Is no fair-minded man
who studies the history of this country from
the days of its foundation down to the pres
ent time and who deduces the difference be
tween eight millions of people- and eighty .mil
lions, who considers the telegraph, telephone
and railroads, who will cot 'say we are mark
edly better physically, mentally and morally
than our grandfathers or even our fathers.
' "Then you believe the House of Rep
resentatives is just as representative
as it was in years gone by?"
Yes; yes. indeed.' The house Is Just as rep
resentative a body now as It was when this
country had only ten millions of people. If
you listen to all that Is said you might believe
the country Is fast going to the devil, is fast
becoming a monarchy and will cease soon to be
a republic. Why, I heard that same kind of
talk when I was a boy, when we used to
gather at camp meetings. They used to tell
us that things were not what they were In
"the good oid days." You hear thÂ« same
things now â that the country Is retrograding:
that everybody is corrupt and dishonest; that
there Is wholesale immorality. I do not hesi
tate to assert that thla country is better to
day than it ever was in Its history; that the
people are better â more honest, more moral and
less disposed to yield to temptations that are
put in front of honest men at every turn.
The people are Just as mighty now in the
matter of elections as ever before, and Just a3
discriminating as to whether a man has done
hia duty. Xo man ever gets so big that he
cannot easily be wiped off the political map.
And how quickly the people do it, too! They
settle a man so quickly that he la soon for
gotten. /
I venture the prediction that few of the best
men In the country could sit down to-day and
give offhand the namÂ«s of 100 men who have
helped to make history in the House of Repre
sentatives." Tha "others were defeated and for
gotten and that was the Â«nd. There was Wil
liam J. Brown, who put -through the House
the appropriation of $30,000 to build the first
telegraph line between Washington and Balti
more. He did the world an Immense service,
yet at the ! next . election afterward he. received
hardly enough votes to count. The opposition
put up a man who ridiculed the Idea of send
ing messages by "lightning." and he beat
Brown thousands of votes. So it is to-day, al
though a man's' services now are not so easily
forgotten. .V,,- 7
Undoubtedly we are better off than our fore
fathers. The millennium is not here, it Is
true, and things will not be a- bit Interesting
when everything becomes perfect. We are do
ing better, though..

that the President cf the republic. Gen

tal for an unknown destination, troops
*vere sent in pursuit of the chief magis
trate. What took place after that can
not be definitely determined, but it is
known that a light occurred about ten
miles from here and it is supposed that
General Pimentel. the rebel commander,
\u25a0was attacked by Government troops.
The whereabouts of the fugitive Presi
dent Is not known. It is generally sup
posed that he endeavored to reach the
coast and board a sloop with the object
of reaching Puerto Plata, on the north
coast of Santo Domingo. On the other
hand, there are those who believe that
the President is endeavoring to cross
Banto Domingo by land and reach Monte
Christl, ion the north coast.
Juan B. Sanchez, former Foreign Min

AMERICA HOLDS ALOOF.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.â For the pres
rnt there will not be any interference by
the United States in the difficulty which
has. arisen in Santo Domingo. The
trouble is regarded by the State Depart
ment officials as entirely an internal one,
end so long as outside interests are not
menaced this attitude of non-interven
tion will be maintained. If. however, con
ditions fihould change materially and law
]< ps arts should be committed against
Amrrirans and American Interests or in
volve the collection of the Dominican
customs by this Government or other
violence occur which in the opinion of the
officials here would make it proper for
this Government to interfere, this step
will be taken and measures will be
adopted to quell the trouble.
This decision was reached by the State
Department officials during the day and
â¢was confirmed at a conference at the
White House late this afternoon, in which
the President and Secretaries Taft, Root
.and Bonaparte participated. The Cabinet
'officers remained at the White House
until nearly 6 o'clock. The gathering,
however, was not called specifically for
the purpose of discussing matters bearing
on the developments in Santo Domingo,
but to talk over a number of Questions
which the President was anxious to dis
pose of preliminary to his departure to
morrow for an outing of several. days In
Virginia.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26.â Rumors here
to the effect that Luke E. Wright of Ten
nessee is soon to retire from the place of
Governor General of the Philippines and
will be succeeded by James F. Smith of
California, now a member of the Philip
pines Oommiseion, are denied by Secre
tary Taft, who said to-day that Governor
Wright was expected to return to the
Philippines at the expiration of his pres
ent leave of absence.
There has been some criticism in cer
tain circles, both in this country and*in
the Philippines, of Governor Wright's
administration, but it is not believed here
that any dissatisfaction with it has been
expressed by either the President or Sec
retary Taft. The latter gives no encour
agement to the report that General Smith
may ultimately succeed Governor Wright.
Some Catholic influences, which are said
to be hostile to Wright's administration,
have opposed certain features of General
Smith's work as chief of the Department
of Education in the Philippines, but these
influences have not made their power felt
In Washington, where General Smith's
policy is highly commended by the of
ficials having charge of Philippine affairs.
Apparently, from Secretary Taft's com
ment on the current reports regarding
Governor Wright's retirement, no change
is contemplated in the head of the Philip

"This interference is a part of Presi

of the party organizations in other States
as well as New York. They want to get
control of New York. first, but the Presi- ;
dent Is trying.it also, in- Connecticut and,
Ohio. They are trying to get the two'

they wilt have a fignt before they get

SPOKANE, Dec. 26.â Rev. Charles H.
Braden of Grace Baptist Church to-day
completed his task of converting. the win

into a temperance lecture. The city
turned out _en masse to see the result,
and it took policemen with clubs to keep
the crowds- from .obstructing traffic.
There are nine big plate glass windows
on both jj sides , of the \ saloon and they
ordinarily are filled with California Wines
and various sorts of , liquor. To-night,
however, they- are made up into a series
of tableaux^and" pictorial displays to; il
lustrate the"downfall "of j a young fellow
who starts out as a "moderate; drinker."
In the one window the hero "Joe" and his
bride "Mary" are standing up before. the
clergyman who is marrying' them. Full
size wax- figures are used,' The second
window shows; him leaving ; for. a- saloon
against the protest of his wife. .Then he
is seen drinking with friends. Cartoons
from prohibition magazines complete
these scenes. -*' ~
The fourth scene shows "Mary" as a
disheveled woman hard at Iwork over the

VATICAN BOOK
ON SEPARATION
Volume Deals With Eecent
Divorcement of the Churcli
and the State in France
STATESMEN ARE BLAMED
Effort Made to Make Clear
Causes Which Led Up to
the Cutting of the Ties
Â» .
PARIS. Dec. 26.â A French translation
of a Vatican " white book regarding the
separation ot church and state reached
Paris to-night. The volume consists of
300 pages, divided into a preface, two sec
tions and an appendix, the latter contain
ing many unpublished documents. The
book disclaims any intention of replying
to those whom It calls the detractors of
the church and expresses the desire not
to offend any one, saying that its chief
objects are to enlighten public opinion re
garding the facts and to prevent the
handing down of mlsstatements connected
\u25a0with the history of such an important
event.
In the leadlns chapters an effort Is
made to demonstrate that the entire onus
for the rupture between the Vatican and
the French Government and the resultant
separation of church and state rests with
various French cabinets, the members of
which pursued an anti-religious policy,
including the suppression of the . congre
gations and of religious instruction in the
schools.
The book next proceeds with the refuta
tion of the accusation that separation was
rendered inevitable by the attitude of the
church. It declares that this charga
was made because French statesmen,
knowing that the people of France had
no desire for a separation, wished to dis
claim responsibility for the consequences
which, it is pointed out, would be equally
serious for France and for the church.
Then follow arguments showing the al
leged baselessness of the charges brought
against the church of acting contrary to
the interests of the republic. The ques
tion of the nomination of bishops la dis
cussed at length.
The appendix deals in detail with the
French protectorate over Catholics In thÂ»
Far East and tho argument Is advanced
that, although .this protectorate 13
founded on international treaties. It must
depend on the will of the Vatican.

. ing their Institutes with the meeting of
the Teachers' Association.
The work of organizing the annual ses
sion has been dene in splendid shape by
I'resMent James A. Barr, who is the Su
perintendent of the Stockton schools.
Through his efforts these other organi
zations were induced to meet with the as
sociation. He has been ably aided by
thp. executive committee.
# It will be the purpose of this convention
to discuss live topics of the day which
have an influence on t the schools of the
State. Papers have been prepared by
\u2666 eminent scholars and will be read at the
â¢ dally sessions. The principal topics un

POORLY TRAIXCD IX ENGLISH.
The main pspcr of yesterday's session
was read by Miss Mlna Cole of Santa
Clara. It was a report of the special
committee appointed to investigate the
preparation in English which the. pupils
of the grade schools receive before they
; enter the high schools. Miss Cole stated
that while the spirit in the grades was
excellent, yet the pupils really entered the
high school very poorly trained in the
. ability to write good English. She placed
the fault with the methods of instruction
â¢ used in many- schools, declaring that the
teaching of English should begin in the
primary schools end be developed grade
by grade. Her report was heartily ap
â¢ plaudfd. '
Professor E. P. Cubberley oX Stanford
University read the report of tne commit-
. tee *on the tenure of office of teachers.
In it he deplored the method of the an
' nual selection of new teachers and the
worry the teachers undergo during this
period. He declared that teachers should
be kept during their efficiency and that
if they are to be dropped they should be
Notified by the end of the term, and not
ifter they hays departed for their vaca
" tiens. He proposed that such a law be
. pessed by the Legislature.
. . DISCUSSES RURAL SCHOOLS.
* At the morning session of the Council
Â° of Education Professor James P. David
son, Superintendent of Schools of Marin
County, discussed the supervision of rural
school?. He said that the present county
boards were inadequate and that the
counjty superintendents should be given
assistants to help them do the work.

Headache
We want you to know that
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills pre-
vent as well as relieve head-
ache, and that they leave no
bad after-effects. We assure
you that if taken when you
first discover indications of an
attack, they will drive it away,
and thus not only save you the
misery and distress, but the
Weakening influence of pain
upon your system. Used in
this way the attacks become
\u25a0less frequent, and eventually
.entirely disappear. They re-
lieve pain by strengthening the
nerves and overcoming the
turbulent, excited condition,
which is the cause of pain.
. . "We used Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
in our family tor five years, and I
would not like to do -without them.
Before I found this remedy I would
have spells of sick headache. so severe
that I would be prostrated for as
many as 48 hours at a time. The
Anti-Pain Pills stop the pain in a
few minutes. I have a great deal of
neuralgia around the heart, and the
Pain Pills also relieve that. I now
take them when I think I will have
an attack, and they stop it right
then. I ejso notice that Ido not have
these spplls nearly so frequently \u25a0 as
formerly." :

Yankee Caught in Float

Shield by His Captors
EUREKA. Dec. 26.â A bloody battle on
Christmas night between rival fishermen
of Eel River resulted in the wounding of
several men. The American and Italian
fishermen had a falling out at thÂ© open
ing of the season. The feelinjr became
so bitter that late Monday night a
party of Italians descended on the float-
Ing river saloon in which the Americans
were celebrating Christmas and shouted
their intention of cleaning out the place.
Before they could approach nearer a
charge . of buckshyt^was fired Into their
\nidst and several of them were wounded.
Xhe lights in the saloon were put out and
\he Americans launched a boat and
>ulled toward the shore. Tho Italians
noticed .'he maneuver and followed. When
near the !>ank the Americans fired upon
them again, wounding several more.
Had it n'.t been for the fact that the
Italians had stopped at the saloon and
captured an American named Casey, who
had been loft behind, a fatal fight would
have ensued- Casey, who had been
wounded, called to his companions ashore
to cease firing. To insure better protec
tion the Italians held up Casey and used
him as a shield. Later the Italian*
reached shore at a point lower down the
river, and. after binding and gagging Ca
sey, left him in a field badly wounded.
He worked himself loose and made uid
way to Lolota. He was. arrested there to
night on complaint of one of the Ital
ians. \u25a0
Another American known v French
was wounded in the stomach and is in
a serious condition. Two others were ar
rested near the scene of the trouble.
Four Italians have been treated for
gunshot wounds, making a total of six
men wounded in the fight. Feeling ia
running high to-night and it is believed
more serious trouble will follow and thera
is talk of calling upon the county authori
ties for aid.

thief assailed' him. During the struggle
they rollÂ«.Â»d very near the edge of the
car, when the conductor caught the
board. He managed to throw the thief
from the car, and he immediately climbed
down the ladder so he might secure the
pack, which had rolled off with the
thief. Finding the booty and hearing the
robber scrambling up the hillside, he
bearded the train and notified The Dalles.

followed along the trail until he caught
up with Jack lying in a drunken stupor.
Frenzied by the white man's liquor he
split Jack's head cpen from the top, and
hacked far down into the trunk. Then
he attacked Mary, and she received sev

THE- SAN* FRANCISCO \u25a0 CALL", WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 27. 1905.
ALICE NIELSEN
TRIUMPHANT IN
DON PASQUALE
Brava, little Nielsen! Brava!
Alice Nielsen came home last night to
show what she could do in grand opera-
She came as Norina lin "Don Pasquale,"
the Tlvoll the place, and Pacific avenue.
Telegraph Hiir and everything between
for audience. We had heard here of
Milan approving, of Naples admiring, of
Miss Nielsen's London triumphsâ but she
"had to show us," as they say at the
Orpheum. She "showed us" last night,
and the local incredulity as to its own
.was neatly shattered, and those who be
lieved that theyfetching little singer had
simply dlmplea her way into grand opera
were fairly confuted. For Miss Nielsen
has distinctly "arrived."
The poetlo fitness would have been bet
ter served had it been the old Ttvoli
where Alice Nielsen sang last night. It
was -there that the silvery little voice
was first heard and that fascinating little
mole first seen. But she did not look a
day different last night. She is Just the
same round-eyed, dimpled, dainty \u25a0 little
thing as ever, and the voice, though
larger, is still as f resn and pure. .
But the Nielsen of last night is a
very different person from the little
singer that used to do "bits" at the old
Tivoli. Perhaps she 'has not yet the
full sweep of grand opera. A year
will make a tremendous difference . in
the singer. She is now on the oper
atic fence. Palpably she Is a little
afraid of the comic opera (suggestion,
and as "Don Pasquale" happens to be
that kind of opera, one misses therein
the natural merriment that she fears
to bring toMhe role. But give Miss
Nielsen the aplomb that comes from
full recognition, and the operatic
stage will gain one of the most charm
ing of the lighter lyric singers. She
sang a charming Norina last night,
that in time should be as brilliant as it
is now exquisite.
This means, of course, that Uls's
Nielsen, always a good student, has
been hard at work since she left here.
Her coloratura work in particular his
gained and the voice has gained both
in volume and quality. The trill is
still not good, but the 'scales pearl out
delightfully and she has one of the
rit-Ulest of staccatos. She is still trua
as a lark in the intonation and the
purity and freshness of the voice sur
prise anew every time one thinks of
them.
And easily as a lark she sings,
phrasing- with charming taste â except,
perhaps, for an exaggerated pianissimo.
Miss Nellsen is not the fair Lulsa, but
from her work last night one sees am
ple room both for her and Tetrazzinl
on the grand opera stage. Even Tele
graph Hill shouted "Bis!" for her, and
the rest of the house heartily added
its quota of appreciation.
"As to acting â in spite of the afore
paid fear of being wholly her very\
comical self â Miss Nielsen was most
plquantly satisfying, and as to picture,
she was the prettiest that grand opera
has to give. That was why, perhaps,
one forgave the . last curtain being
rung up while she sang Tostl's "Good
by" that had been "requested" by some
good but-inartistic souls. Not that she
did not sing it well, but thai; kind of
thing should be left- to the Melbas
and Pattis. Miss Nielsen is much too
pretty so to offend.
The support includes a little jewel of a
tenor # a pocket Guille, who matches Miss
Nielsen's canary note witn a little vocal
silver of his own that might have Jbeen
made for the business. His name is Sig
nor Pratti, and his voice is pure tenor,
lyric in the fullest sense. And Slgnor
Pratti. is as good a singer , as he is a
tenor. It Is not a powerful voice, but so
delicately shaded, so nicely used, that
all the effect of volume is given. He
smiles as prettily as he sings, which
makes up for acting that is somewhat
naive. But Slgnor Pratti's boyish Ernest
is a distinctly likable achievement all
round, and vccally a small gem. His
"Com 'c Gentil" was delightfully sung,
rouslngly encored, and repeated with art
less pleasure In the applause.
The barytone, Fratodl, might be better
If be had remembered to bring the rest
of his voice alongâ and Slgnor Rosa is
almost a voiceless basso. But Rosa is
otherwise a good buffo. The* Tivoli cho
rus, so rejoiced to get into rand opera
again that it came in a scene ahead, did
well. The unprogrammed director did
good work with the "scratch" orchestra,
and broke all Tivoli records with his
white kid" gloves. .
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Teddy Webb on Deck.
Teddy Webb has recovered from his
serious illness and will reappear at the
Tivoli to-night. He will play the char
acter of Jupiter in "Orpheus in Hades."
He will sing several new topical songs
and introduce a number of novel witti
cisms and specialties. -S.'-.*-"

HBALDSBURG, Dec. 26.â About mid
night fire destroyed the old Presbyterian
church owned by Rev. J. Overton of Oak

EXPERT MAKES
A LONG REPORT
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 126.1 26.â Engineer
Frank Olmstead, who was engaged by the
city of Los Angeles to pass upon the feasi
bility of the gigantic project to bring the
waters of Owens River, in Inyo County,
to supply the needs of this city, has made
his" report. It Â«s a voluminous document,
covering every phase of the project, and
may be summarized as follows:
Length o f conduit, 291.4 miles; estimated
total cost of project, 536.524.669; time neces
sary for completion of work, eight years;
material requiredâ cement, 1,565,595 bar
rels; steel bars, 126,138.40 tons; steel plates,
28.424.19 tons.
The project, although stupendous, is en
tirely feasible and reasonable. The seri
ous factors are cost, time and the chance
that the General Government might com
plicate the situation in Owens River. Val
ley by . the inauguration of reclamation
bureau work. There are 15,000 miner's
inches of water available for Los An
geles. It will be necessary for the city
to build a railroad and three cement
manufacturing plants to be kept in oper
ation four years to carry on the work.
Los Angeles' present consumption of
water is too. close to the danger line of
shortage. This city Js expected to have a
half-million of population by the time the

a joint session of the State Farmers'
Institute and the nature study depart

Both branches. The afternoon sessions

Dr. True is director- of experiment
'stations In the Department of Agricul
ture at Washington, D. C. and one of
the foremost figures In the world of
agT.icultur.il research and experiment.
Hir address this afternoon \u25a0was a force
ful plea for the inclusion of agricul
tural Instruction In the public schools.
'He spoke in part as follows:
MOVEMENT AX OLD OXE.
The movement for the introduction of ln
etruction in agriculture into secondary and
primary echools is passing rapidly from the
et&ge of atft&tion to ' that or action and
realization. The agitation of th!Â« subject in
thiÂ« country bÂ»gan in the days when Wash
ington, a great farmer as well as a great
general and statesman, was the foremost man
in the new republic. It has ebbed and flowed
many times since then without leaving any
lasting Impress on* our educational system,
until within the last decade it has gathered
*uch volume and assumed such substantial
form that the permanent accomplishment of
its object seem* assured.
When we inquire wjiy this Is bo the reasons
are many, but they may be grouped un<iÂ«*r
two or three main heads. In general the
claims of agriculture to a place in Â©or public
echcol eystcxn are based both on the economic,
eocial and educational needs of agriculture
and agricultural people as related to our pres
ent civilization and on the pedagogic require
ments of a school system which shall be
adapted to the masses of people in a demo
cratic and industrial state and to the sym
metrical culture of the mind and body of
the human child. In a word, intelligent farm.
?rs and learned pedagogues approaching the
eubject from their respective standpoints now
Â«neÂ«t on a common platform and, each party
UElr.g the arguments appropriate to his call-
Ing, agree that agriculture Is a fit and useful
subject to be taught in public schools. Hence
the friends of agricultural progress in this
country have good reason to believe that ere
long agriculture will be generally taught in
our schools and form a permanent part of the
public school curriculum.
GREATNESS OP INDUSTRY.
An old argument, which has not altogether
lost its force, is that agriculture is a great
and fundamental industry. In the United
States alone, leaving out the forests, about
850,000,000 acres are devoted to agriculture;
there ar* nearly 6,000,000 farms on which
30. 000.000 men work for the direct support of
a rural population of 4U.000.000 souls. The
value of these farms and their equipment is
over $20,000,000,000 and the value of their
produrts in 1905 was $6.415,00fMX0. The manu
facturing industries that depend upon farm
products for raw materials employed 2,145,000
persons in 1900 -end used a capital of $4,132,-
OUO.OOO.
Bat the bigness and fundamental character
of agriculture may be used chiefly to draw
attention to the economic, social and educa
tional needs of the agricultural people as a
large eection of the community uslnjf the pub
lic echools. Economically ejvaklng: the farmer
or horticulturist of to-day and of the future
irrjst be a more intelligent and better informed
man than hlÂ» predecessor in order to compete
on advantageous terms with men in other
calling's and to secure cure and adequate re
turrs for his labor and capital.
Moreover the American farmer needs to
Vain somewhere that in the age on which we
are now entering the co-operative spirit will
bÂ«- more and more essential to the best eco
nomic conditions cf agriculture, as of other
Industries. The farmer of this country has
tttaa far been the bulwark of an individualistic
organization of industry and of society in gen
<ral. But we are beginning to see that ex
cfrtve Individualism In Industry Is resulting
in. an. overweening aristocratic or plutocratic
or oligarchic control of Industries and that in
come way we must evolve the trust co-operat-
I\> organization of our Industries if we are
to preserve the democratic character of our
social and legal institutions. The farmer boy
studying agriculture with his comrades In" the
public schools will more readily grasp the
I<lea that community Interests are advantageous
In agriculture and we shall thus produce gen
erations of farmers who will work together
for the right advancement of their industry.
COMMUNITY OF INTEREST.
ThÂ« unintelligent farmer In every age and
land has sunk to the level of a stolid and im
progressive peasantry, and in this way. In spite
of the effort* of great statesmen and philan
thropists the general level of prosperity among
farmers has been kept very low.
But -In addition to the economic needs of
agriculture there are the social needs of agri
cultural people. \u25a0 In obedlÂ»nce to the general
influence* of our developing civilization and
the peculiar tendencies of farming under irri
gation our Western farmers are inevitably
Vf :r.g drawn into closer social tie* and the eur
rcSts of their lives are Intermingling with those
or the communities in which they .live In ways
which a* yet they are loth to recognize and
the general rtcults of which they are as a
rule too. Innocent or too Ignorant to discern.
Meanwhile the other forces of society are
more and more banding themselves together
to .control the ballot box. legislation, social
Institution* and the general conduct of affairs.
Unless the fanners can be co educated that
as a mas* they will .have the co-operative
eplrlt. hay* some real and Vital understanding
of community cf interest and know how to
mingle to their own advantage with men of
cither vocations, their lives will forever run
In a narrow and monotonous channel and the
control cf even their own affairs" will largely
pass Into the hands of other men. I
But If our agricultural public have great
. economic and social needs they also have
what may be termed educational needs,
which arÂ« even more important and
fundamental. For. after all. it Is the
untrained mind of the farmer which
" holds him down to a dull routine, keeps him
Jn isolation and condemns him to comparative
poverty. And by education I do nat,of course
mean merely the Imparting of information, it
1* rather thÂ» developing of the rclnd, " the
broadening and clarifying of the mental out
look, the giving of the right turn to the mental
processes, the strengthening of the will and
of the power' 'to use! appropriate mean* to
accomplish useful ends. The education which
the farmer needs is that which â¢ail) give him
â¢era* real appreciation of the progressive and
(scientific eplrlt of the age In which he lives
\u25a0will arouse a k*en Interest in the facts and
principle* of science as related to his own
vocation, will show him that In agriculture
Is an ample opportunity for lifelong studies
which may refresh and delight the mind, a*
well a* minister to material euccÂ«ss. and In
general will lift agricultural practice out of
drudgery Into the domain of Intelligent and
hopeful latoor.
SCHOOLS CAN DO MUCH.
\u25a0 So thÂ» farmer comes with his economic. Â«o
cial and educational needs to the teacher' and
ackÂ« what the echools can do to make him a
ruore successful business man. a better citizen
and neighbor. . a more Intelligent and happy
man. And he expects an answer based on an
Intelligent and sympathetic appreciation of bis
ttttCs. &a well es an up-to-date understaadin*
GOVERNMENT EXPERT WHO READ A PAPER BEF*ORE THE FARMERS' IN
STITUTE YESTERDAY AT BERKELEY. IN WHICH HE DWELT UPON THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY OF AGRICULTURE IN THE SCHOOLS; â¢
cf the functions of a public school eystem or
ganized in accordance with the requirements
cf the masses of youth in a democratic state
anfl ideals of education which, however firmly
they may be rooted In the general experience
of mankind in the past, are nevertheless grow
ing and expanding in the light and air of the
twentieth century after Christ.
The educator who receives the farmer in this
spirit, can. I believe. Rive an encouraging re
ply to bis appeal. The American public school
system wai at first developed chiefly in the
effort to overcome illiteracy among the masies.
Even -when the high schools were established
their cournes were almost exclusively literary.
Ao millions of children came to be in the
elementary schools and hundreds of thousands
in the hich schools, it became apparent that
the old literary curricula and the general at
mosphere of echcol life on the old basis cre
ated a distaste for the manual occupations in
which the vast majority of all the students in
public schools must engage during their adult
And thus the problem has presented Itself
to our educators of so changing- the public
schools as to bring their work into vital rela
tions with the real life and activities of the
masses of our people. This is the stage of ed
ucational development In the midst of which
We are to-day.
Naturally the movement for the remodeling
Df cur school system to meet the require- |
ments of Industrial life had its most active ;
development first in the cities, where the school \u25a0
fystem was moet highly organized and where;
tTÂ»e very rapid increase in the extent and va- <
riety of mechanic arts and manufacture* cre
ated a tremendous demand for youthful work
ers whose minds had been prepared to deal
with the problems presented in such pursuits-.
Already provision for the teaching of mechanic
arts in the public schools Is made in forty
States. While In IS9O there were only thirty
s*ven cities of BCGO population Â«.nd over in
which manual training was taught iir.the pub- \u25a0
lie echools in 1902 there were 270 each cities.
Ban Francisco and Los Angeles are among this
rumber.
EDUCATORS' IDEALS CHANGE.
The most -important -result of this move
ment is that our leading educators have now
changed ideals of education and recognize that
the industrial element is an essential factor in
a completely cultural education. The move
ment for agricultural education, therefore, has
a sound pedagogical basis. . V-t
It is not the old trade school which we wish
to revive and make a part of our public school
system. The object is not to cut out the old
studies which educators acree should be in
cluded in all elementary and secondary courses,
but rather by a more judicious selection of
the topics to be taught in the various branches
to make room for the enrichment of the public
school courses by the introduction of Instruc
tion in agriculture, mechanic arts and domes
tic *ctence. The elimination of uselr-ss topics
aad the . judicious employment of the elective
ej-Etem in the high school will allow agricul
ture to be taught in an effective way to make
the atmosphere of the schoolroom' favorable to
thÂ» cultivation of a love for country life.
The teacher can also now say for the en
couragement of the farmer that owing large
ly to tho work of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture and the agricultural col
leges and experiment stations in California
and the other States, there is now a large
body of definite knowledge which may be
called the principles of agriculture. And this
knowledge has been alreacy more or lesa com
pletely reduced to pedagogic form for use in
various grades of schools. Elementary text
bookis and books'of reference on agricultural
subjects are now in existence and being rap
laiy multiplied. " Successful examples of the
teaching of agriculture In the pchcols are al
ready found in this and other countries.
Thus our argument is complete. The farm
er boy or girl comes to the public school with
fundamental economic, social and educational
reeds that should be met with special training
in agricultural ' lines. The teacher comes to
the public school* with new Ideals of educa
tion that make the industrial element an es
sential of sound education and with an abun
dance of material for useful instruction in
ngriculture. Surely old time traditions and
prejudices cannot long bar the way to the ef
fective teaching of agriculture In our public
echools.
COST NOT XS AnGUMEXT.
But tome one rises up and says It will coÂ«i
too much to give farmers' children such in
struction In the public schools. I cannot be
lieve that such an ' argument will have much
weight with the American public In general
or with the California public In particular. -
No doubt we must pay more for our public
nchools in the future than we have in the
past. We must have better schoolhouses bet
ter trained teachers and more apparatus and
Illustrative material and we must pay the bills
for these things. But it has been proved over
and over again that ' education of the right
kind promotes industrial wealth aÂ« well as
thÂ« general well-being of mankind. And if
tbe States where the puniic school system of
the past, with all - Its limitations and de
fects, has been . most thorough - in . Its work
have been the States where the general levi-i
of material prosperity has risen highest, and
no roan who knows tbe facts will deny thit
surely It Is reasonable to expect than an edu
cation which aims directly to promote â¢ Indus
trial. .efficiency, ao . thÂ« ; aew education does.

will more than pay for its Increased cost by
the Increased wealth which it will produce.
If literary education has been a very profit

dustrial education is likely \u25a0 to prove a bo
nanza.

BAD CARTRIDGE
SAVES A LIFE
Unknown Man Points Pistol
at H. B.' Gross' Heart, but
the Trigger Fails Purpose
LUNATIC IS AT LAKGE
Painter Faces Death at the
Hands of a Man Whom He
Says He Never Saw Before
OAKLAND. Dec. 26.â T0 the fact that
a cartridge failed to explode when the
weapon containing it was pointed full at
his heart H. B. Gross, a painter and
paperhanger residing at 2115 Peralta
street, owes his escape from instant death
this afternoon when he was attacked by
a man whom he believes to be a mur
derous lunatic. Gross was working In
the saloon of Peter Christiansen, at 483
Seventh street, when the stranger, whom
the painter declares he had never before
seen, entered the front door and without
a word drew a pistol from his pocket and
pointing it at Gross pulled the trigger.
The cartridge, however, was faulty and
failed to explode, and, without giving his
assairant a chance to fire another shot
Gross dashed through a rear door and
made his escape. The supposed maniac
did not follow his Intended victim, but
dropped the pistol and running from the
front door of the saloon made his escape
In the direction of Webster street. F. W.
Judd. residing in West Berkeley, was in
the saloon at the time of the attack on
Gross, but v like the latter, he thought
only of getting out of range of the pistol
and did not attempt to prevent the escape
of the pistol wielder.
As soon as he escaped from the saloon
Gross notified a policeman of the attempt
which had been made to kill him. A
search is now being made for the assail
ant.
Gross declares that he did not rec.ognize
the man who tried to kill him and did not
think he had ever seen him before. He
says that he knows of no reason why any
one should try to take his life, and that
his assailant must either have mistaken
him for some other person or have been
either drunk or crazy.

DREAM TURNS
INTO REALITY
Woman Who Had Visions of
Burglar at Work in the
Home Finds He Is There
HUSBAND GIVES CHASE
People Who Were Victims
of Crowhurst Gang Again
Visited by Desperado
BERKELEY, Dec. 26. â In her dreams
at 1 o'clock this morning Mrs. John
Weldlein of South Berkeley had a feel
ing that a burglar was in the house,
and after uneasily tossing on her bed
finally awoke and said to her husband,
"Oh, John, I dreamt a man was in the
room â a burglar." That woke the man
of the house up and he listened for evi
dence that might corroborate his wife's
visions.
The evidence was there, for Weldlein
plainly heard footfalls on the lower
floor of the house. Hastily arising.
Weldlein grabbed his shotgun and
skipped down the stairs. As he ran he
noted that his clothing, which had
been on a chair, was lying on the floor
In a disordered heap. The burglar
heard Weldlein, and needed no other
warning. Through a kitchen window
he bolted, just too soon for Weldlein
to get a shot at him.
Returning to his hoorn, Weldlein ex
amined his clothes and found that the
thief hadÂ» emptied the contents of them
on the floor and taken the money from
the pile of miscellaneous articles scat
tered on the carpet. Weldlein found
that $75 had been stolen. The police
were promptly notified.
The Crowhurst gang held up Mrs.
Weidlein a year ago, securing $5 from
her in the candy store on Adeline street
which she and her husband own, and
which, adjoins their living apartments.
Blaker confessed to this crime while
in the County Jail at Oakland. The
three youths,, members of the gang,
forced Mrs. Weidlein to give up $5 at
the point of a pistol. The Weidleins
state this is the fourth time they have
been robbed since their marriage five
years ago.
BODY OF AN UNKNOWN
FLOATING IN THE BAY
Key ltoute Passenger Gets
a Brief Glimpse
of It,
OAKLAND, Dec. 26.â With one arm
bent up so that a well gloved hand and
the sleeve of an overcoat, apparently of
good quality, could be seen, the body of
a man was seen- floating in the waters
of the bay this morning by a passenger
on one of the Key Route ferry-boats, who
reported the fact to the Coroner. The
corpse was, as far as could be dlscov-^
ered from the deck of the boat, that of a'
well-dressed ' man, . that, had apparently
been In the water but a short time.
Deputy Coroner Van Vrankin asked that
a watch be kept for the body at the Key
Route, broad and narrow gauge piers.
The body was seen near the Key Route
pier, but as the tide was, running strong
It soon drifted out of sight of the pier,
floating in the direction of Oakland har
bor. .
The body was floating partly on its
side and the face was turned away from
the pier, so no description of the features
could be secured, but as it rose and fell
in the water it could be seen that the re
mains were clothed in a suit of dark ma
terial. .
CLERGYMAN REFUSES PROOF.
OAKLAND, Dec. 26.â After -two
hours of questioning to-night the Rev.
Robert Whltaker, pastor of the Twen
ty-thlrd-avenue Baptist Church., be
fore the City Council refused to give
any proof as to charges of graft and
crime in Oakland. Councilman Edwin
Meese, as chairman of the Finance
Committee, demanded evidence, but
Dr. Whltaker said the public . were
the judges. Councilman Elliott urged
the clergyman to produce evidence and
was met by general statements." Dr.
Whltaker read a resume of his address
last week before the Police Commis
sioners. In his statement to-night he
declared:
"I have no evidence which I care to
commit to commission, court or Coun
cil."
He made a charge of dereliction
against a policeman, not named, and
against a saloon man for selling
liquor without a license. Elliott pro
posed that Dr. Whltaker name an in
vestigating committee on graft and
crime, with a practicable scheme to
carry out an investigation. The pas
tor said he would consider the offer.
The new license ordinance was
passed to print. .

WOMEN SETTLE
FATE OF MALEY
Assailant of Mrs. Christie
Identified by Girls of
Berkeley as a Wretch
OFFENDER IS JAILED
Complaint Sworn To by Wife
of the University Trainer.
Others Accuse Prisoner
BERKELEY, Dec 26. â 'That Is the
manr cried Mrs. Walter Christie this
afternoon In Marshal Vollmer's office
as she faced John Maley. a butcher of
Berkeley, who committed a serious of
fense in : her presence on the univer
sity campus yesterday afternoon, and
was soundly thrashed for it by Walter
Christie, her husband, a trainer of ath
letes at the institution.
Maley was brought face to face to
day with both Mr. and Mrs. Christie,
who positively identified him as the of
fender of the day before. Mrs. Christie
at once swore to a 'complaint against
Maley, and the latter was taken to
Oakland by Detective Jamison.
It has developed that Maley, who is
a married man with a pretty little wife
and two children, is a pervert about
whom many complaints have been
made to Marshal Vollmer. Three
girls were called into the Marshal's of
fice this afternoon and each Identified
Maley as an individual who had gross
ly insulted and sought to attack them
on the streets of the university town
during the last few months.
Laura Kern, a pretty telephone girl,
took one look at Maley and swore that
he had committed a misdemeanor and
attempted to attack her. Similar
charges against Maley were made by
Fannie Ferguson, a candy girl em
ployed in James Farrell's store on Cen
ter street. Miss Ferguson resides In
Oakland. Her Identification of Maley
was positive. A little girl. 12 years
old, whose name the police did not
divulge. Identified Maley as a man of
whose conduct she had told her parents
a few weeks ago.
Walter Christie found to his amaze
ment to-day, after a careful inspec
tion of Maley. that the latter is a man
whom he pummeled for an Insulting
attack upon a university professor's
wife, on the campus, two years ago.
Maley was arrested then and held in
5100 bail in Justice Qulnn's court. He
forfeited his bail and the case was not
pressed.
Maley maintained a stolid silence to
day when questioned about his of
fenses. His eyes are black and his face
iÂ« bruised as the result of Christie's en
counter with him yesterday.

GETS WRIT OF MANDATE
Wants Mayor Mott and City
Council to Show Reason
for Alleged Irregularity
OAKLAND, Dec. 28.â From the Council.
S. O. Holmes, a property owner on Louise
street, has gone into the courts In his
fight against the granting of a franchise
to the Key Route ferry system tor its
proposed Twenty-second street line, and
to-day ho sued out a writ of mandate
directed against Mayor F. K. Mott and
the members of tha City Council requiring
them to appear and show causa why cer
tain alleged irregularities were allowed to
creep Into the proceedings advertising the
franchise for sale.
Holmes and some other property own
ers made a vigorous light against thÂ»
granting of the franchise. They were
charged with having demanded money
from the company to withdraw their op
position. The technical objections made
to the proceedings, it is declared, are the
result of error on the part of Holmes' at
torney in having mistaken â c special law
governing the sale of railroad franchises
for the general law governing the sale of
street railway franchises, which require
different modes of procedure.

NOTORIOUS SLUGGER OP
CHICAGO IS DEAD
"Black Jack** Gallagher Reaches tie
End of a Remarkably .strenu
ous Life.
CHICAGO. Dec 26. â John Thomas
Gallagher, known In police circles as
"Black Jack, the Slugger." and ac
cused of more acts of violence la
strikes than any other one man In Chi
cago, died at his home yesterday.
Stomach trouble, superinduced by the
strain and worry resulting from
ceaseless prosecution, was tfco cause of
his death.
Gallagher was 22 years of age and
in appearance was as different from,
the popular conception of thÂ© profes
sional "slugger" as could be Imagined.
He took great pride In his appearance
and was seldom, if ever, seen under
the influence of liquor. While lia
welshed but ninety pounds at the timo
of his death, three years ago Gallagher
weighed ISO. and he was able to
strike a blow that would render hia
victim unconscious instantly.
When arrested by the police in con
nection with some crime no amount of
"sweating" could make him talk. On
more than one occasion, his friend*
say, he was submitted to rough treat
ment by the police, but he always
maintained a dogged silence.
Although frequently arrested by the
police and on at least one occasion
kept In jail for several weeks, he was
never convicted of a crime.

First of Bravos Accused of
the Assassination of Joe

a Machiavelic Plot That
Lured Fisherman to Death
On the evening; of January 21 GHu

familiarly known &â¢ "Joe. the Fisher
man," Innocently entered the barber
6 hop of Petro Rala, at the corner of
Muon and Francisco streets, and
Joined a band of his countrymen In
light-hearted festivities. A few min
utes before midnight a fight started in
the dcee-packed room, a fight singu
lar in that it eeemed to have no rea
sonable starting point, and in that
every one aeenied to band against Olu
\u25a0eppe. &SB
Backed to the walL bis coat off. a
whirlwind of thrashing arms before
him, he at length drew a revolver in
defense. Other revolvers Immediately
flashed Into light and. terrified by the
weird unanimity and ferocity of the
attack, Giuseppe threw himself out of
the door into the midnight dark street.
Immediately " the throng In the room
poured out after him. revolvers spit
ting fire. He ran west along Mason
street, the pack after him like hounds.
At tke corner of Vandewater street he
tutnbled, grot up, turned Into the nar
row way, stumbled again, and then
with a few last long straining strides
came to the little gate in front of the
house numbered 6. where he fell dead.
Yesterday before Judge Carroll Cook
and twelve Jurymen Angelo Napoli sat
to answer for the murder. The prose
cution Eay that Xapoli was one of the
revolver-shooting pursuers that ran
â¢â¢Joe', the Fisherman.' to his death,
and that the fight hid been deliber
ately planned by Xapoli, to afford the
chance of ridding himself of the man
with whom he was at feud. Giuseppe
-Brogardo.
XAPOLI A CHARACTER.
Napolt, sitting in court besides his
counsel. A. B. Treadwell, presented an
interesting appearance. He is a short,
thick 6et man, tremendously powerful.
The head is small, black and close
cropped; the eyebrows are heavy and
slgzagg-ing above small, bloodshot eyes.
He wore a neat black suit, a pink and
white bow tie and a high collar. The
high collar was too narrow for the
bull-like neck and. dug Into the blue
black Jowl above, so that the head was
constantly twisting and turning and
the thin lips were twitching in a fe
brile nervousness unpleasant to look at.
The testimony yesterday confined it
self to the shooting, not the causes.
Assistant District Attorney Whiting
conducted the prosecution; A. B. Tread
>ell the defense. Dr. Fletcher McNutt,
who performed the autopsy over the
body of Brogardo. testified that the
man had -<3ied of a bullet. entering
through the back and piercing the
liver and one cf the large blood ves
tels. Rosario Domini and Frank G.
Ardolla testified to the beginning of
the quarrel in the Raia barber shop.
Thomas Shea, a young machine
hand, was passing along Mason street
the night of the murder. He saw Bro-
Srardo dart out of the barber shop and
.down the street, pursued by the band
of shooting men.
CORROBORATIVE EVIDEXCE.
"vVilliam McKown, a stableman,
gave practically the same testimony.
.It would appear from both of them
that Napoll was In the pursuing
throng, but not among the leading
ones. Policeman Max Fenner told of
being: attracted by the sound of the
shots from his beat at Francisco and
Powell streets, of running up Fran
cisco and then Mason, and arriving at
the mouth of Vandewater street just
as Salvator Strano was returning, the
fell deed ended. He told of arresting
him, pistol in hand, and turning him
over to two citizens â Thomas Shea and
W. E. Weisse â while he kept on in a
pwrsuit of Andrea E. Brasllio. Their

COMES TO GRIEF.
Ambitious Celestial : Tries to
Force Creditor to Pay.
Gathers Up Soiled Linen Uninvited and
Is Forced to Return It
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Wing Lung, whose laundry is at 190?
Ellis street, plumes himself upon the
fact that he embraced Christianity and
thereby was enabled to learn to read
and write the language of this coun
try and also to acaulre a more thor
ough acquaintance with American
business methods than he could have
attained by remaining In heathendom
and illiteracy.
Mrs. Georgie E. Mayhew. whose
boarding-house Is at 1352 Fulton street,
Informed Wing Lung that she had de
cided to change launderers and would
no longer require his services, and he
reminded her that she was indebted
to him in a sum of SI 50, which he
would l!ke to have paid right there
and then. He was told to call again.
That was six weeks ago and Wing
Lung's attorney told Judge Fritz that
although his* client had repeatedly
called again the 51 50 remained un
paid. Wearied at last of wearing out
his paper soles In futile endeavor to
collect, Wing Lung bethought him of
his mercantile training and also of
what. an American creditor Would be
most likely to do If similarly situated.
The result of his cogitation was a visit
to Mrs. Mayhew's domicile when she
was absent, his packing and carrying
away of a huge bundle and his leaving
of this message, penciled on the back
of a business card, for the lady's en
lightenment when she returned and
found her wardrobe depleted:
Dear landlady: I take your wash now; you
better bring $6 over my house, then you will
get It. Tour wash you owe me $1 60 before
and $3 60 thlg wash.
When the card was found by Mrs. May
hew she caused a search warrant to Is
sue, and the bundle of clothing was duly
seized. It loomed large In front of his
Honor Judge Fritz, who declined to dis
miss the defendant, also to approve the
filing of a burglary complaint, and con
tinued the case until January 3, by which
time he hopes to have the involved legal
perplexities digested.
The prosecution pronounced Wing
cial Policeman Stone, who arrested
him, his revolver still on him. Stone
on the stand told this part of the
story. W. E. Weisse corroborated the
story of Thomas Shea, who had testi
fied previously. The two were the
citizens to whom Policeman Fenner
turned over his first prisoner. While
he was gone a throng of Italians gath
ered about the tw ( o men and, half by
force, half by bluff, took away their
prisoner. Both men pointed to Napoll
as the leader In this deliverance.

INSURANCE
MEN EFFECT
A BIG DEAL
Two Largest Life Companies
AVest of the Mississippi
to Be Consolidated at
Once Into Great Concern
COMBINATION WILL
PROVE BENEFICIAL
Polic3 r Holders Now Possess
a Tremendous Bulwark of
Strength to Resist Any
Attack That May Be Made
. The Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany of San Francisco and the Conserva
tive Life Insurance Company of Los An
geles were consolidated under one man
agement yesterday. > The gigantic deal
was consummated in the . interests of
economy and for the benefit of the policy
holders. . .
Tho new concern will be known as the
Pacific Conservative Life Insurance Com
pany. Its president will be W. S. Tupper
of the southern corporation. Others of
the several directors will be Henry T.
Scott, G. I. Cochran, G. W. Scott and Wil
liam Crocker. The central offices of ttiÂ«
new company will De in San Francisco.
The funds will be Invested In California
exclusively. Where the policy-holder was
strongly entrenched before he will now
have a double bulwark for the safeguard,
of his interests and may see the absolute
certainty of the liquidation of any liabil
ity. The salary of no officer will be In
creased by/ the consolidation, but the . ex-,
pense of management will be reduced one
half. In this connection <It has been
learned that Henry T., Scott, the famous
shipbuilder,, has given. his services abso
lutely free to the Pacific Mutual since the
retirement of President Moore. . It was
largely through the former's efforts and
in the interests of the policy-holders that
the consolidation has been brought about.
BENEFITS CALIFORNIA.
The combination of these two immense
interests means much for * California. r It
will "mean vastly niore as time goes on,
because the nÂ«w concern under a man
agement which, from its personnel, must
be unquestioned will absorb a large part
of the business which has formerly gone
to the corporations recently exposed in
the East. The deal Is the biggest thing
of its kind ever consummated in life in
surance. The new company will have
only two larger rivals west of the Atlan
tis seaboard. It will have more business
than the five ble insurance companies of
Chicago combined and more than all the.
companies of Dps Moines. lowa, -' the
"Hartford of the West." The assets total
approximately $11,003,000. The Pacific Mu
tual will rank as one of the world's great-j
est financial institutions. Bvery Callfor
nian should be proud of it. . ,
Mr. .Tupper, who ranks- as. one of the
\u25a0greatest' of^the country's Insurance men,
and Henry T. Scott, â¢* well known, to San
Francisco,* are the principal figures in the
negotiations which have ended so bene
ficially. *'\u25a0\u25a0 - ,
The actual consolidation and selection
of offices will take place as soon as pos
sible.. Not one cent of money was paid
as brokerage fees for effecting the trans
fer. Two hleh officials of the new com-,
pany Issued the following statement last
f 100.000,000 INSURANCE.
An amalgamation has been effected whereby
the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company of
this city and the Conservative Life Insurance
Company of Los Angeles have . been merged
into one company, under one management.
Henry T. Scott.. W. H. Crocker, and George W.
Scott, who; are directors of the Pacific Mutual
and represent, a controlling Interest in the
same, negotiated this arrangement with Colonel
W. S. . Tupper. and Georgo I. Cochran, â¢ respect
ively president and vice president of, . the Con
servative Life, I who, .with their associates, con
trol that company. \u0084'. . .
Neither one of ' the companies will be ab
sorbed by thÂ» other, nor will the business
of either, company be sold to the other. U
is a. consolidation of all the business and In
terests into one j large ; strong company.
It will be the largest life insurance merger
ever effected in the United States. The con
solidated company will show insurance in
force of nearly one â¢ hundred millions, assets
exceeding ten millions and surplus of eleven
hundred thousand. H will be the only: life
Insurance company domiciled on the coast or
having a home office in . the Western States.
It will be one of the largest companies in the
United States. It will be the largest one west
of the Northwestern Mutual of Milwaukee and
larger than the five Chicago companies com
bined. It will be larger than - the- five ' In
dianapolis companies Â» combined and much
larger than the seven ' lowa companies . com
bined. -.. It -. will practically .. be the only, life
insurance" company of the whole region west
of the" Mississippi River. With the exception
of the Northwestern, of Milwaukee and the
Union Central of Cincinnati. Ohio., it .will be
the largest company in the United ; States not
located on the Atlantic seaboard. .::Â» : ;

where both companies have a branch or
agency In the same city, the same will be
consolidated, saving rent, managers' and cash
iers', salaries. The greater strength and pres
tige Jof tha combined . company will attract
business even more readily than either does
aftfce present time. In, view of the- fact that
the Conservative Life alone writes more busi
nPS3 than any other company does In Califor
nia, the "combination" will sweep Â»the coast and
all the Western States. Since tho Conservative
Life single-handed has beaten the - giants in
California the combination may be expected
to be the", leading and most prominent insur
ance force on the entire coast, and no doubt
eastward to the Mississippi Rivet-.
The most Important result of the combina
tion will be larger . dividends to policy-holders
which really means an ultimate lower net
cost of Insurance. There. Is; every- reason to
believe that with the savings and economics
which are possible under, the combination the
new organization will not be beaten In the
United States on satisfactordy returns to pol
icy-holders. While the strength and solidity
of either comoany has never been questioned
the consolidation will make a still stronger
company. -
The amalgamated company will have two
home office centers. The Pacific Mu<.ual has
a fine home office building In this City, and
has recently acquired the property through to
Commercial street, making a splendid site for
a new building. If needed, 150x180. The Con
servative Life - Insurance Comoany ; has . a flno
modern office building In Los Angeles." - The
company's home office activities will be equally
divided between the two points. AH policies
will be written from the San Francisco office
and sent cut from there, it being. a more cen
tral point for distribution. The policy depart
ment, medical department, agency department,
claims department and * actuarial department
will be operated from the San Francisco office.
This will. result' ln the removal of some sixty
odd employes from Los Angeles to San "an
cleco. Colonel Tupper will spend- most o.his
time at the San \u25a0 FranciÂ»co of flee.
How; will the mercer be effected? Â»There are
plain â¢ provisions and statutes . enabling such a
move to be made. With a perfect understand
ing between ' the controlling powers of both
companies, working harmoniously together,
there will . be no obstacles . whatever. The de
tails . to carry out the plan set out above will
be arranged . at subsequent meetings \u25a0of both
companies.

so says Professor McAdle. The fall yesterday,
amounting to .06 of an Inch, was confled to

A LESSON IN REFORESTATION.
CONTRA COSTA Mountains, on the east side of the bay of San
"Francisco, were once wooded. When Dana made his two
years' voyage before the mast and visited San Francisco in
1832, those slopes, now mostly bare of trees, were forested. The
great redwood stumps are still found in many places, decaying mon
uments to the forests that were. In some places the eucalyptus has
been planted and flourishes in scattered groves that are rather mo
notonous in their grouping, but still serve to enliven the landscape.
Not many attempts have yet been made to recreate a genuine
forest, with its natural variety of trees, grouped as they grow in the
tracts that are planted by nature. The best example of such a forest
is found on Joaquin Miller's place, "The Heights." Less than
twenty years ago it was a lofty and barren ridge, rather forbidding,
txcept for the noble v^ewthat it commands. It was not watered,
except by the rains, and to the casual observer seemed the^ least
promising spot in all that range for the growth of a forest' But
he began planting, and at the same time began calling public atten
tion to the necessity and the possibility of recreating the forests
that mean so much to California.
Long in advance of the efforts of the Federal Government in
that direction, he inspired a group of people to promote tree plant
ing and inaugurated the first arbor day on Goat Island, when oc
curred the last public appearance of the beloved General Vallejo, who
told the people present of the glories of the primitive forests that
he knew in his childhood in this part of the State. Trees were
planted that day on the island and flourished until careless guar
dianship caused their destruction by: fire. Had this been prevented,
the bay would have been adorned by a thriving grove, and the
'memory and suggestion of that first Arbor day.
' \u25a0 The Poet of the Sierras kept on planting his own land, and now
Jiis heights are covered by the most charming forest. Cypress and
lh.e. conifers, redwoods, eucalyptus, oak, the olive, poplar and beech
have all been used, and the sassafras and many other exotics, trees
grown from seed sent to him by Gladstone and other friends in
Europe, have joined in making what was a blear ridge and slope one
of the most charming spots around the bay. It is a genuine forest,
not-a struggling plantation of starving shrubs. It is not monotonous.
The variety of foliage, running from the weeping willow to the dove
tinted leaves of the olive, give it the varied aspect of the natural
forest.
' Now all of this has been done in a few years, showing the natural
capacity of our mountain soil and climate for the rapid production
of trees. It is an object lesson of the greatest value to our people,
and should encourage the National Forestry Bureau" to delay no
longer the refores&tion of the lands that have been stripped of tim

thing to forest its islands in the bay. Goat Island and Angel Island

the Presidio and Black Point reservations, and the bay scenery would
be transformed if it were done. Anybody, anywhere, with the* pa

OUR ITALIAN COLONY.
npHE Italian colony of San Francisco numbers 25,000 people. Â» It
I would be remarkable if there were not among them some thrift
* less and some criminal individuals. . But the colony must no
more be judged by them than our American population consisting
of those whose families have been on the soil for centuries should
be judged by the few who lapse into crime and misdoing.
. It js part of the art of headlining news, especially criminal news,
in the daily press, to flash up something startling, that arrests atten
tion. This being done in the case of crimes committed by Italians
takes the form of ascribing the offense to the Mafia or the Black-
Hand, or other criminal associations known to exist in parts of
Italy. It is far from the policy of American papers, in which such
headlines are used, to misrepresent or humiliate our Italian people.
The fact about them is that criminal statistics prove the colony,
to be remarkably free from crime. Perhaps a majority of them are
Piedmontese, the people of the valley of the Po, the countrymen and
compatriots of Cavour, the statesman who created "modern Italy.
They are a wonderfully industrious and thrifty people, who make
bread for many and filch it from none. Some of our greatest rural
and business enterprises belong to them. They hold an exceedingly
creditable position in the .public life of this city and State. An
Italian sits on the bench of our Supreme Court. - An Italian has
creditably represented this State in Congress. Italians have proven
themselves most appreciative and intelligent members of. our school
board and our Board of Supervisors. Italians do credit to the
learned professions of law and medicine. We have no more pa
triotic citizens than they. They love our institutions and use with
out abusing the broader opportunity of man in this land, which in
their native Italy they called "The land of the beautiful flag."
There has never been any evidence of the existence of the Mafia
or Black Hand or Camorra in our colony. Tru Italy, where officials
and statesmen note what goes on among their expatriated country
men all over the world, the Italian colony of San Francisco is noted
for the peace, prosperity and friendly fellowship of its members.
They bring here no feud nor vendetta, and soon add to the virtues
of their fatherland those of their asylum in this land of liberty.
They have such a place in our industrial and business life as makes
them valuable citizens, who would be missed if they were withdrawn,
and we desire to say for them that no such charge can lie against
them as is made in other of our large cities.

THE TALE OF A FOOL.
ONCE upon a time, a certain Fool
who had been made the Mayor of
a great city because the people
knew the sort of man who ought to
represent them cast his eyes about him
in search of other'graft.
"Aha!" he said to himself, "there is the
gubernatorial office. It shall be mine." !
. So the Fool consulted his Boss, and his
Boss told him how to get the coveted
prize, and thereupon the Fool shouted the
slogan of the People and was #uly elected
Governor.
/Then did the. Fool cast his eyes about
him in search of 'other fields to conquer,
and when he had done so he said to him
self, "I will be a United States Senator, j
for there are but few of them who have
a smoother, slicker graft than mine."
So the Fool again consulted his Boss,
and his Boss told him how he might be
come a Senator: and after that he was
duly elected. . r-v
Then did the Fool again cast his eyes
about him in search of a bigger snap, ana
he said to himself: "I wonder if it is pos
sible that I might be President."
So he again consulted his Boss, and his
Boss said: ."Sure!' It's dead easy!"
"But I am only a Fool," remarked the
aspirant, who was not so foolish that he
did not understand his limitations.
"Oh, well;- get j onto yourself. Read
some history, an' you'll see dat fools ain't
barred," his Boss replied.
So the Fool laid his wires for the Pres
idency, but whether he ever got there I
never heard; and all that remains is theâ
Moral: If a Fool Is not without ambi
tion, he can find considerable to encour
age him in the pages of history.

account of himself at almost any time.
Incidentally, lie has excellent social po

town among those of his own kind.
He was just turning the corner into his
home street the other evening when he
caught sight of three men standing on
the walk a little farther down. A thought
of a hold-up came to him Immediately,
but his pride and his proved ability to
take care, of himself prevented his turn

heightened by seeing one of the three

WHY THE BIG WEDDING ?
Dorothy Fenimore
WHAT American- parents, j sending 1
out invitations to their daugh
i ter*s wedding, would have either
the courage "or sincerity to express
their Inmost thoughts as naively as
those parents ot Welsh brides who, bid
ding their friends to- attend the marriage,
also bid them not to come empty-handed?
When our daughters are about to be
married, and the presents begin to arrive,
we are wont to profess that such a con
tingency wa3 as far from our thoughts as
the cold side of the farthest star Is from
our material vision.
We suffer a shock when the caterer In
sists that a room must be set asideÂ»where
the guests may view the evidences of
both families' popularity, and the finan
cial surplus of their friends.
On the occasion of the wedding we take
pains to remove all the cards from the
gifts in. order that we may receive due
credit for great delicacy of feeling.
But, are the facts in the case very dif
ferent from those in Waleg, whore candor
IS not considered beneath social dignity,
where the host and hostess have the
nerve to add to their invitation: "What
ever donation you may be pleased to be
stow will be thankfully received, and
cheerfully repaid whenever called for on
a similar 'occasion. The parents of the
bride and bridegroom-elect desire that
gifts due to them will be returned to them
on the, above date, and will be thankful
for all favors granted."

The form of the Welsh "bidding" ex
presses their position neatly; 'tia/ human
nature whittled to the point. Whatever
is so genuine as its statement la cannot
Justly be reckoned vulgar.
The humor of the invitation Is less in
its simplicity than in its deOnltene33,
which does not leave a single loophole for
escape.
There Is much Injustice done, however.
in our estimation of the motives of our
neighbor who gives the wedding. If tha
ceremony is at church, and followed by
a big reception at the house, there 13 al
ways some one who slyly hints, with a
lift of the eyebrow and a Jspowing smile,
that there's sure to be lots of presents.
Well?
If the bride' 3 father was simply after
furnishings for his daughter's homeâ the
implication which lurks in the shadow of
the tilted eyebrow nnd the crooked smile
he would save money by giving' up tha
party, and fitting: up the flat.
Big weddings with many witnesses and
appropriate rejoicings are institutions
founded on a social factâ the enormous
value of the father's and mother's gift
to their prospective son-in-law. They, are
surrendering to hinv formally, btrtrsrith
all possible grace, their darling: daughter's
happiness and pride. Surely there can
not be too many witnesses for such a
solemn . giving. This, and not the gift
bringing, is the sertoxrs, the primary rea
son why big weddings have become a
custom of the day.
But the giving of weddlntr presents is a
time-honored usage. It is the bride's
privilege to enjoy this peculiar pleasure
of rich possession, which, as the years
go on, and rase after vase has been
broken by the hired srlrl, and' the fine
plates and saucers get nicked, and tho
cups lose their handles, grows In value,
with lessening substance, f of sweet as
sociation's sake.

UNION LEAGUE
CLUB AFFAIRS
Regular Ticket May Meet
With Opposition at the
. Coining Annual Election;
ORDER OF SUCCESSION
H. G. W. Dinkelspiel Crowded
Out of the Line to Make
Place for M. H. de Young
The annual election of officers for the
Union League Club will take ; place one
week from next Tuesday. The name of
George H. Pippy for president heads the
regular ticket. S. J. Hendy still retains
his place on the ticket as first vice presi
dent It is common gossip that ho ex
pressed a desire this year, last year and
the year before, last that Colonel: Pippy
should serve as president one more term.'
That Colonel Hendy lean have the regular
nomination for the presidency any time
he desires It therd is no question of doubt.
This delightful situation . applying to the
first vice presidency hardly extends to the
second vice. The office of second vice
president is now filled by H. G. W. Din
kelspiel. He was for years reckoned as
next in order of succession to Colonel
Hendy, but it seems that the reckoning
was not correct, as the nominating com
mittee that recently created the regular
ticket displaced Dinkelspiel from the line
and put in his place M. H. de!: Young.
Now it is gossip In the league that after
Pippy Hendy will come, and after
Hendy's reign DÂ© Young will shine as
president of the league. The' outlook > is
not enchanting to Dinkelspiel. It is not
a sure thing that he will submit -without
a struggle to the execution ,of . the pro
gramme. His friends maintain that he
possesses what may be termed vested
rights.
The points at issue, of course, can be
settled by- the membership of the club at
the annual election.' It is said by the fol
lowers of Hendy, Pippy, and De Young
that DinkelÃplel can appeal to the whole
body by simply placing aji \u25a0\u25a0. opposition
ticket In the field. The regular ticket has
the prestige of regularity and usually com
mands the support of the members who
are satisfied with the club management,
but occasionally the opposition, when ac
tive and well organized, achieves a
triumph. . : â¢
* Mr. Dinkelspiel and his supporters are
now looking over the field and collecting
information that may be useful in the
event of a contest The club ia now
in a prosperous condition and its future
prosperity would not suffer in the least
by the introduction of an opposition
ticket. An exciting contest, such as -one
between Dinkelspiel and De Young would
surely be. could not fail to develop an
unusually large vote. As no ballot can
be cast by a delinquent there would be a
general settling up of old accounts In
order to bring out the full voting strength
of each side. /

RACING IN FOG IS A NOVELTY
AT INGLESIDE TRACK.
. Prominence Beats
Tom MeGrath,
a Favorite:

Galloping.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The racing at Ingleside yesterday
â¢ was novel, inasmuch that but a fleet
' lai glimpse of the horses now and then
/was obtainable. The fields in the first
four events were completely enveloped
in fog. the start being announced by
,' 'a. bugler stationed at the post. A
â¢ 'drizzling rain and a muddy track added
'â¢ io the sombre aspect of the situation.
.Still the crowd speculated just the
. tame. Three favorites were returned
. first.
QI'EKX REC A WINNER.
Queen Rec finally graduated from the
â¢ maiden class by taking the opening
".. two-year-old scramble. The black nliy.
..ridden by Emmet League, remained a
â¢ consistent favorite In the betting and
"won going away from Avonella at the
.. nniFh. Graham landed Nettie Hicks in
the show.
On Saturday last Prominence finish
ed fifth m a race won by Tom MeGrath.
The latter colt was installed a 1 to 2
favorite for the Futurity course two
year-old event yesterday, and Prom
inence beat the Sehreiber entry in a
walk. Chief Wittman ran third. Five
to one could be had about the winner.
Smithy Kane lost his company in the
sloppy going soon after the start of
the third, a six furlong run. Rice rode
the Texas half breed, which splashed In
nearly three lengths before Estrazaand
â¢ El Piloto. The other starters were a
. trashy consignment.
HOVAI-TY I.KADS THnOUGHOUT.
All agreed that the going was made to
order for Royalty. Teddy Robinson had
the eulker out in front from start to fin
ish of the mile and a quarter selling fix
ture. The closest horse to him at the fin
ish was Hi Caul Cap. which downed the
favorite. Bay, four lengths for the place.
The winners odds were hammered down
â¢from S to SVs-
Possart has ifeeen a real friend to the
bookmakers this season. The black horse
opened up favorite for the first mile sell
ing run at odds of 7 to a. When a rush
play came on Ed Sheridan, forcing the
â¢ price from threes to Bto 6. the odds about
Possart lengthened to 11 to 5. Radtke had
the mount on Ed Sheridan, and it proved
only a cat-hop for the Schreiber gelding.
Severely puniehed by Knapp. Possart
nosed Fury out of place honors.
There appeared to be no cal! for any
* thing but Bob Ragon in the betting on
the concluding mile selling affair. Bob
' went to the post favorite and won all the
" way. Jackfull secured the place, a neck
before Byronerdale.
XOTES OF THE TRACK.
I*"Canada Jack" Adkins boosted the
â¢ Billing price of Prominence from $800
lo 51000, and Charley McCafferty let
the filly go.
W. Gabriel sold Instructor to Dell
Fountain yesterday. The reported
price paid for the Brutus horee was
$1500.

p.nd Brooklyn Jockey clubs close on

obtained from Judge Pettingill.

Boxer Gilmore \u25a0 Winner.
CHICAGO. Dec. 26. â Fred Gilmore,
former amateur feather-weight cham
pion" of America, who was knocked out
recently by Fred LJnsted, a local nov
loe, grained the decision over the same
fighter to-night in the tournament of
the Illinois Athletic Association. Gil
more had the advantage in all three
rounds, using a straight left, which
Llnsted was unable to solve. In the
farmer fight Llnsted knocked Gilmore
out with a right swing. In to-night's
fight he tried continually to land a
similar blow, but Gilmore waÂ« too
clever and easily avoided his oppo
nent's efforts.
Clone Games fa Handball Tonraey.
Unusually close games marked the
play last nigrht in the Olympic Club's
handball tournament. Graham Richards
beat Frtnk Forran 8-21, 21-20, 21-15.
T. I. Fittpatrick beat F. Barkam 18-21,
21-18, 21-17. Fred Bain beat George

refereed all games and Henry Stein

WOULD STOP FOOTBALL

President Eliot Does Not Believe Men
Who Ruined Game .Should Be
Tnwted With Its Reform.
NEW YORK, Dec. 26.â That : President
Eliot of Harvard University does not be
lieve the intercollegiate rules commission
should be entrusted with* reforming the
present style of playing football Is evi
dent from a letter he has written In an
swer to the Invitation of the conf ercnee
of twelve to attend, a meeting at the
Murray Hill Hotel. in this city to-morrow,
at half past 10 o'clock. President Eliot
in writing that the invitation . had been
received says: \u25a0\u25a0 .
"I avail myself of this opportunity to
tell you that my own belief is that inter
collegiate football should be stopped for
one year, so that individual colleges may
demonstrate in practice, each on Its own
ground, a reasonable game of football.
"There seems to be a ' well-nigh unlver
sar consent that the present game' is in
tolerable, and surely this is a great im
provement in the condition of public sen
timent. For myself I find it impossible
to believe- that committees, coaches and
umpires who have ruined the. game are
to be trusted with reform or replace
ment. .The- experts. who ruined the game
are not the persons I should select to ad
vise about selection or creation of a sub
stitute. \u25a0 -.-;\u25a0,-\u25a0-.:\u25a0- . ; \u25a0 . '\u25a0 -- .:..'"\u25a0
"The fundamental . difficulty with the
present game is ; the bad spirit in which
It ,is played. Tq get ' rid ;of this : vicious
spirit I think we must stop intercollegiate
football for a time. On the whole, there
fore, I favor separate action by .= indi
vidual colleges and ' not Â£ conferences or
other attempts to continue intercollegiate
football under the new regulations."

CHICAGO, Dec. 26. â The energetic
work of Mayor 1 Dunne in suppressing

made a practice of buying up theater
tickets and selling them to the public
at exorbitant advances.
; Ever since the football game on
Thanksgiving day the Mayor has been

the scalping of theater tickets, and
to-day- he called a meeting of the
theatrical managers of the city to de

LITTLE CHANCE

Champion Does Not Need
the Money and There Is
No] Glory in Sight
JACK SEEKS NOTOEIETY
Apparently Wants to Help
\ Along Theatrical Vent
ure on Eastern Circuit
On the eve of his departure for the
East to Join a burlesaue company Jack
O'Brien has issued a challenge to Jef
fries... His * den \u25a0Is not taken seriously,
but Is looked upon as a medium through
which he can get some advertising In the
East and thus increase the box office
receipts.
If Jeffries could develop the physical
condition he had when . ho fought Jim
Corbett In this city, and there la no
reason why he should not, he could
probably defeat as many Jack O'Briens
as could crowd Inside the ropes of a
twenty-four-foot ring:.
In the . first place It Is believed one
look at Jeffries would be enough to
frighten O'Brien. , as It has bigger and
braver men. Efforts to reach Jeffries by
wire yesterday resulted In the following
reply:
"Los Angeles, Dec. 26. â Jeffries left for
his ranch, twelve miles north of the city,
at noon to-day, and was expected back at
midnight. He did not return and his fam
ily does not know Just when hÂ» will be
back. He therefore knows nothing of the
challenge Issued by O'Brien. His brother
Jack stated that there Is hardly a pos
sibility of Jim accepting any proposi
tion for a flght. Tim oa.T -hlngr which
could Induce the retired champion to
again enter the ring, his brother says. Is
to find* some person the defeat of whom
would add to his record" as a pugilist,
and he does not think whipping O'Brien
would odd to his laurels.
"As far as the financial end of It Is
concerned, Jeffries does not need the
money. He quit the ring with a big
bank account and since then has made
several profitable investments in real es
tate."
ThÂ» name of. Jimmy Britt was asso
ciated with that of Mrs. Fitzslmmons in
the East and the Calif ornlan was quick
to enter a denial. He wired Fitzslm
mona:
NEW YORK. Dec. 26.â Robert Fltzsimmons.
Alhambra Theater: Rumors connecting my
name with Mrs. Fltisimmons false. Have
seen her once. Nobody regrets your defeat
and other trouble more. JIMMY BRITT.

State Commission Claims
Part of Money in Hands
of Corporation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND. Dccl 26.â A bitter lÂ»gal
battle probably will ensue over the sum
of money left over when the affairs of the
Lewis and Clark Exposition are wound
up. The Oregon State Commission has
formally notified the corporation, through
Secretary Henry B. Reed, that it will
hold the officers and directors of the fair
responsible for the distribution of the
money, which It has been announced will
amount to about 25 percent of the orig
inal Investment of . the stockholders, or
$100,000. The official communication ad
dressed to Secretary Reed states that
the commission claims a pro rata share
of the funds now In the possession of the
corporation after all liabilities have been
settled:
The Oregon State Commission also
demands an accounting of the money
which has been expended by the cor
poration. The communication states
that the commission Is acting under
the directions of the Attorney General
of the State of Oregon. Should the
Oregon State Commission win out In
the contention, the stockholders in tho
corporation would receive hardly more
than twelve per. cent. About $400,000
was paid Into the corporation for stock
and the State appropriated, about
$400,000. It is asserted that the many
financial transactions that did not meet
the approval of the State Commission
will be aired if the accounting 13 or
dered by the courts. r

Crashes at Full Speed Into

Passengers Are Thrown to
Deck, but Crockery in Buf

\u25a0 The. Southern Pacific ferry steamer
*;-rden City, ivith Captain Hemsworth
in command, did the best she could
â¢â¢Fterday morning at 10 o'clock to
Â«* reck the new ferry depot at the Ala
uieda mole. The men In the pilot
t ouse, it is said, either forgot to ring
;iiÂ« stopping: bell or the bell refused
*o tinkle at the critical moment, and it
Â»vas with full speed that the steamer
crashed into the apron. Two clusters
V? deep driven piles kept the Garden
â¢City out of the depot, and the greatest
iianiagre was wrought among the crock
ery in the restaurant and the bottled
liquors In the bar. Passengers were
;!irÂ«wn to the deck, and for several
minutes there was a terrible panic on
joard. Fortunately the steamer was
not- crowded or many lives might have
been sacrificed In the disorder follow
;:.g the sudden stop.
The apron on the slip was badly
â¢amaged, several piles were carried
i. way- and one of the steel rods bracing
\u25a0~ha <nd of the Blip was snapped In the
r.rSdle. The hull of the Garden City
Â»u.Tf<?red little, as she struck squarely
\u25a0jti. her blunt nose.
In the restaurant, however, the
f mash-up was complete. Hardly a

tvhich was strewn with crockery and
I*"***- chops, steak, fish and eggs.
" he" Japanese waiters stampeded, and
It -was some time before they could be
I^rsuaded to return to the restaurant
lÂ»id clear away the wreckage.
So violent was the Jar that the cash
!rÂ» Sister behind the bar was torn from
ltÂ« fastenings and hurled across the bar
to the deck, where it was picked up a
!>rj>e:e.ss wreck. Nearly every bottle
la tiie. bar was broken, and althougrh

There was an unusually high tide
Yesterday and it revealed a serious de

\u25a0iÂ»pot. The arch of the entrance to the
ransrway leading- from the apron is a

than head room for passengers, and
'â¢> Â«drive a wagon of any kind or a
truck from steamer to mole
would have been an impossibility. At
present the Southern Pacific does not

THE COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON, Dec. 26. â Amalgamated Copper,
North Butte, Anaconda and Copper Range were
the features of a strong market. Buyers were
plentiful at the opening and the advances were
sharp In most stocks. . North Butte jumped
over four points on small sales and held Its
gain all through the cession. Copper Range
still seems to come out rather frfely. but the
floating suppl'- of stocks must be rapidly get
ting .exhausted. United Copper has declared
a regular dividend of Hi and an extra divi
dend of one-half of 1 per cent, payable Janu
ary 26. Books close January 8.

Â»w York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 26.â COTTONâ The mar
ket was dull and sluggish, with both' New Or
leans and the L>tven>ool markets closed; ' \u25a0-\u25a0
There was some effort to ' push prices up,
but this was unsuccessful because 'of persistent
selling which was In evidence. . There was
little news, but further Southern advices again
proved rather bearish.
As this week is generally observed through
out the Continent as a holiday festival, little
Is to be expected of the market until after, the
turn of the new year, especially as the majority
of trade is now Inclined to await the publica
tion of the Census Bureau ginning report cov
ering the amount of cotton ginned up to Jan
uary 1 before undertaking any extended move
ment.
This report Is not due until : January 9, and
its importance lies In the fact that It will give
a better and more definite Idea in \u25a0 regard ' to
tha actual size of the crop, estimates of which
still range all the way from 0,250,000 to $10,
000.000 bales.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. 26.â Until late In the-ses
sion wheat was inclined to be weak. Pit trad
ers largely favored the selling side, but de
mand by leading longs had a tendency to re
strict offerings. Â» At the opening the market
was depressed by the unexpected size of the
world's shipments. An English statistician on
Saturday estimated the total movement at
8,000,000 bushels, but actual : figures supplied
by the same authority to-day showed . the
movement to be over 11,000,000 bushels. '_>, An
other weakening Influence was aa Increase of
Nhi.uw) bushels in stocks- of wheat at Minneap
olis. Selling was also encouraged by reports
of rains In India. In the last hour, buying was
commenced by several prominent commission
houses, and shorts, becoming somewhat
alarmed, covered actively. The demand found
the market apparently oversold and the result
was a quick rally In prices. . The market closed
firm and almost at the highest point of the
day. May opened a shade lower at 87 % c, sold
oft to Sti%c and advanced to b7%c. Final quo
tations were at 87% c, a gain of %&34c. â¢
A slump. of nearly 3c a bushel in the price
of the December delivery, old style, and -a re
covery of the greater part of the loss was' the
feature of trading in corn. Profit taking
caused by reports of heavy local receipts \u25a0 start
ed the decline. The December delivery, . old
style, opened at 47% c, broke to 44% c and
closed at 47c. The May option 1 held steady for
the entire day. It opened a shade lower to a
shade higher at 44c to 44% c, sold between
43% c and 44% c and closed unchanged at 44& c.
The oat market ruled" steady. May closed
unchanged at 31%<3'31%c. ; ',;
Provisions were weaker after a firm opening.
Local packers and foreigners sold freely during
the last half of the day. Final quotations on
May pork were oft 7%c, lard was down 2%@-5c
and ribs were a shade lower.

"George D. Collins Uses Tem
porary Bespite to Flash
His Teeth at Dogs of Law
i Who Are in His Pursuit
31EX WHO SAVED HIM
ESCAPE OTHEK DUTY
Three Jurors Criticized by
District Attorney Excused
From Minnie Adams Case
by Consent of Both Sides
George D. Collins is snapping back
Et ins pursuers. His teeth are flash
ing at District Attorney Byington and
the result will be shown by the de
cision of Judge Lrfiwlor this morning in
proceedings instituted by Collins
against the District Attorney.
Collins filed an affidavit with Judge
Juawlor yesterday th^t the District At
torney was in contempt because of cer
tain criticisms he had made concern
ing three members of the Collins jury
that disagreed and asked that the
.jiublic prosecutor be cited and pun
ished.
' Another incident occurred in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday that is di
rectly interwoven with the Collins,
trial. The three jurors, Hickman,
Hartley and Hunt, who voted for ac
quittal in his case, were called Into the
box in the Minnie Adams case. They
had been sitting together. Strangely
enotigrh, out of about fifty names in the
box, these three came out with the
eight first drawn. As the turn of each
to be questioned in the jury box came.
Assistant District Attorney Ferral
esked that they be excused by con
jteat of both sides. Judge Lawlor ex
cused them.
Following is the affidavit filed by
Collins with Judge Lawlor:
After the court discharged the jury on De
cnnbÂ«>r 22 District Attorney Byln&ton falsely
end maliciously stated for publication in The
i <'a!I. and it wae published In The Call Â»<?
timber 23, of and concerning three of the
jurors, who it was allpged voted lor the ac
ouittai of the aiSar.t, namely James P.
, Hunt. Charle* H. Hartley and Newton H.
Hiokman in the following words:
â¢'I believe that the three men who votej
for tht acquittal of Collins were not actuated
1 b>* honest motives. ThoÂ»<e of the other ju
ror? v.hora I ha\e Interviewed expressed the
oj :nien that Jurore Hunt and Hartley had
V>Â«-*n tampered with ana I believe that no
man could with honest motive* vote ,iot
. frul!t\O The evidence was conclusive. Such
juror* are a. menace to justice." i
Thct said statements are knowingly and
*xv<l'fu!!y false and untrue ar.d the said James
P. Hunt. Charles H. Hartley and Newton H.
Hickrr.an were not actuatec by any but hon
est and conscientious motives in voting for
the acquittal of the affiant and were not tam
.l^red wi'.h and are not a menace to justice.
!TheÂ»=p false and defamatory statements were
msde by District Attorney Bylngton for the
I>urpo*e and with the intent of preventing af
. fiant from Slaving a fair and impartial trial
of eald action before a ralr and Impartial

Prisoner Is Released

\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 .
Gazelle eyes, dim with tears, a sallow
complexion, a head bent beneath the per
fidy by which a recreant lover had dis
honored her name and smeared a black
blotch ovor her life, were the character
istic features of Miss M. Lulu Bowen's
appearance yesterday morning in United
States Commissioner Heacock's court to
be arraigned upon the charge of the em
bezzlement of 57007 72 from the postofflce
station In Oakland where she had been
employed as 'clerk, vjn the dark hour of
her adversity she had two friends with
her. One of these friends was her ol<3er
sister, the other was a white-haired
woman in whose features could be read
determination of character mingled with
kindliness. This was Mrs. Armstrong,
a friend of the afflicted girl. While the
lawyers were discussing with the court
the matter of postponement owing to the
absence of Mr. Church, the defendant's
counsel. Miss Bowen's sister placed her
arm around the shoulders of the prisoner
âa mute symbol, of pity and comfort.
Only once during the proceedings did the
defendant exhibit any emotion whatever,
and that was when her sisyer wept upon
her shoulder in the Commissioner's cham
bers while the bail bonds were being pre
pared. Then the disgrace* fir) shed
tears.
It was decided that the preliminary ex
amination should lake place on Thursday
of this week, at 10 a. m., Charles Heg
gerty representing" Attorney Church of
Oakland and Assistant United States Dis
trict Attorneys A. P. Black and George
Clark representing the Government.
There were ... present, also as interested
spectators .United States .Secret Service
Agents George W. Hazen and Richard
H. Taylor and Postofflce Inspectos Mad
df-n, whose search through Miss Bowen's
accounts revealed the extent of the defal
cation.
A. J. Snyder, a prominent real estate man
of Oakland and Berkeley, and C. M. Mac-
Gregor, acontractor and builder of 619Thlr
ty-second street, Oakland, presented them
selves as bondsmen. Mr. Clark suggested
that the bonds should be made equal in
amount to the sum alleged to have been
embezzled, and Commissioner Heacock
thereupon fixed the bonds at a round J7OOO
each. By the time the papers were hand
ed to Miss Bowen for her signature she
had recovered from her agitation and
signed her name with an untrembliflg
hand. ,'Â» ; :
BAKER'S PERFIDY DEEP.
Revelation* Show That Ills Victim
Was Wholly Deceived. t
OAKLAND, Dec. 26.â Bit by bit the
story of the deceit practiced .. upon M.
Lulu Bowen by Louis W. Baker to per
suade her to become a thief is being un
folded. That JBaker lied when he said
the money was going into his business
was proved to-day when the Sheriff took
charge of the Baker Printing Company's
establishment under writs of attach
ments.
Baker is hopelessly involved. His
stock and machinery are under chattel
mortgage. Creditors to the ex/ent .of
nearly $4000 are in sight. There has been
no evidence that Baker's business prof
ited by his dealings with the disgraced
postal clerk. ; -.
It is believed after to-day's investiga
tions that Baker not only got the money,
but that he cruelly deceived the young
woman as to the purpose for which he
intended It.
Postal Inspector R. W. Wadden. in
charge of the case, has repeatedly de
clared that the Bowen woman's only cry
Is that. Baker will soon return and
straighten out her" troubles.
The exposures In connection with
Baker's business . affairs followed the
filing this morning of an attachment on a
claim of $7000 levied on behalf of Mrs.
Matilda Brown, the benefactress of Lulu
Bowen, who has assumed the responsibll-

ity for | the clerk's defalcation: Deputy
District Attorney Everett J. Brown, fcfc
his mother, filed the attachment suit.
Sheriff Frank Barnet placed- Deputy Sher
iff William Moffat in charge of Baker's
printing shop. The Oakland Paper Com
pany levied an attachment to cover a
claim of $924 61, while representatives of
the estate of Harriet E. Donaldson, hold
ing a chattel mortgage on,>the plant for
$1350, also took steps to protect them
selves. From the records it appears that
this mortgage is still alive.; Miss Bowen
has declared to the ' postofflce officials
that $1100 of the stolen^ money was given
to Baker for the express purpose of pay
ing off that mortgage. The accounts at
Baker's establishment seem to show that
he is indebted for machinery in the sum
of $1250 to one firm.' j There does not ap
pear to be any money due the business
outside of a few bills for recent job work.
Unless Baker should be arrested within a
few days his wife will be requested to
take charge in order that the business
may be wound up. -| A petition in involun
tary insolvency will . probably be filed by
the creditors. ..-,"â¢â¢-:
The Postofflce Department was not
ready to-day <' to 'make a demand on Mrs.
Brown for the money to cover Miss Bow
en's shortage. Substation No. 1, which
will be placed in charge of Miss Jessie
E. Logan, was not reopened because. the
officials have not completed the taking
of stock and- the j other clerical \u25a0work
necessary, to close up Miss Bowen's . ac-.
counts.
Mrs. Brown has been in conference "with
friends of the Bowens, as well as with'
members of the family, looking toward
restitution, -ft'r .
The Postofflce Department,^ with- the,
help of -the Federal secret service agents,
has begun a search for Baker. It was-ru
mored' he was seen -last night in San;
Franciscq," but the clew was vague. A
theory that Baker might have committed
suicide has been given some considera
tion by the officials. After ; her release
from. custody. this afternoon Miss Bowen,'
in company with friends, went directly to
her home, 1 612 Merrimac street. "The meetj
ing, for the first .time since, the exposure,
with her mother and sisters was a Apathetic
scene. Miss 1 Bowen will, :so* .far./ as the

and stealing jewelry and other ar
ticles of the value of about $3500.
Mrs. Martien was the landlady of
the house till De'cemberl, having sold
out to Mrs. Hess. She and Lawson,
who, the police say, had been living
together for over a year, rented a room
from Mrs. Hess immediately opposite
the one occupied by Mrs. Hess, and had
been packing up to leave at the 'end of
this month. ; . "\u25a0
Mrs. Hess, for the first time since
taking possession, left her room on
Saturday night to go to dinner: in a

missed- a diamond and pearl necklace

at $85; emerald breast pin, valued at

From the Army, Is Shot by

INVESTIGATES CASE
Authorities Decide Private
Lawrence Pollack Did His
Duty and Commend Him for
His Bravery and Coolness
Andrew Harris, a negro prisoner
awaiting trial by general court-martial
at the Presidio, was shot twice in the
left arm by his, prison guard in an at
tempt to escape Saturday evening. He
was taken to the general hospital,
where he died about noon on Monday.
'Harris and another prisoner were
working In . the neighborhood of the
general hospital under the guard of
Private Lawrence Pollack of the Six
tieth ' Company 'of Coast Artillery,
when Harris suddenly made a dash
for his liberty. Pollack threw up his
gun and commanded the negro to halt,
but as he continued to run Pollack
fired a multiball cartridge at him, both
balls striking him in the left arm near
the shoulder. Pollack then took both
prisoners to the general hospital, where
he left Harris for medical treatment.
"When asked why he had tried to es
cape Harris said he was sure he would
bo convicted and thought he would
take a chance. He said he did not
think the guard would shoot, and if he
did he did not think he would shoot to
hit. ' W-U&
A board of officers was appointed to
Investigate shooting, and after a
thorough investigation decided that the
private was acting .under orders and
commended him for his coolness and
bravery "in preventing the prisoner
from escaping.
Harris was a, private in Troop A of
the Ninth Cavalry and deserted from
the Presidio of Monterey on September
21, 1903. He was apprehended by R.
G., Skein of the San Francisco police
and turned over to the authorities at
the Presidio November 27 last, where
he was charged with desertion. If
convicted Harris would probably have
been sentenced to several years at Al
catraz, and to escape such sentence
he made the dash for liberty which
cost him his life. He will be buried
lii the post cemetery t to-day without
military honors.
TRAMPLED TO DEATH
BY' VICIOUS HORSE
Aged John Pierce Fatally
Crushed by Hoofs of i
Savage Animal.
Penned in a stall by; a vicious horse,
aged John Pierce was trampled to death
last . night. The savage animal literally
trampled the life out of him in the ram
shackle stable in* the rear of his home, 750
Fourteenth street.
Pierce, who was 75 years old*, had been
warned not to have anything to do with
the brute, which had the I reputation of
being a "man eater." But Pierce had been
handling horses for years, and it was his
boast that he could break and ride any
thing with hoofs.
The ; old man went Into the stall alone
to feed the vicious animal. The horse
reared up and struck at him, felling him.
He tried 'to struggle' to one side, but the
brute brought his forefeet down upon the
writhing body with the unerring aim. of
a confimed' "striker," the terror of horse
breakers.
In vain the old man tried to writhe and
squirm out of the narrow space. The
brute brought fore and rear j hoofs down
upon the writhing body. The' old man's
struggles grew more feeble and his cries
for help grew weaker and weaker. When
help arrived he was all but dead. Several
ribs were' crushed, his skull was frac
tured and he was bruised from ; head to
foot. ' V^*S . -
The animal, a big bay, fiercely fought
off the attempt to rescue, rearing on his
hind feet and .attempting to strike at the
rescuers, but Pierce was finally snatched
from beneath his hoofs. The old man
died an hour later, however. He had been
in the employ of Daniel O'Da>vthe street
contractor. â¢
