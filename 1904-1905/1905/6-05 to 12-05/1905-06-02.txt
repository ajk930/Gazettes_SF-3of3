DECKED IX HER BEST.
All Portland was decked in her best,
â¢business was suspended and the holi
day spirit was everywhere in evidence.
The States of Oregon, Washington and
Idaho, In which June 1 had been de
t-lwed a holiday In honor of the centen
nial, sent thousands of visitors. The
trains of yesterday brought the', van-
Kru&ic of the excursionists and to-day
the iallroads and boat lines entering
Portland have been taxed to their. ,ut-
Jnost. Never- in her history has Port
h'.nd been -called upon to care for so
many people:. '. \u25a0'; â¢
The prelude to the actual opening
ceremonies at the exposition consisted
of the parade, a grand pageant of mili
tarism, led by Vice President Fair
banks, the Congressional party, visit
ing Gmernors and other dignitaries and
the exposition officials. With martial
music constantly playing this imme
di:r.e forerunner of the actuality was
greeted with continual cheering along
the entire line of inarch, from-, the new
postolnce and through- the business* and
residential sections of Portland to the
fair srrounds. As the troops passed' the
mass of sightseers flanking the .column
fell in behind, and when. the exposition
grounds were reached there ', was a
-stream of humanity miles tin 'length

i-W. AIR OF EXPECTANCY. â¢
\ promptly at 12 o'clock noon President
H.*W. Goode of the exposition arose and.
gavel in hand, announced the beginning- of
the ceremonies which meant the realiza
tion of Portland's dream. '; The ahnounce
meAt was received with tremendous
cheering, which echoed back and forth
through the multitude for several min
utes. As the echo died away the Right
Rey. David H. Moore, Bishop of the
Methodist Episcopal church, stepping- ta
the front of the platform, raised- his
hands In invocation of the divine blessi
ng. -, \u25a0\u25a0 - â¢ " V
The impressive^ silence which followed'
the* prayer, was .broken as the inspiring,
strains of "Imperial Oregon," a* march;
composed by Innes and dedicated to the
memory of Captains Lewis and Clark and
inscribed to the people or Oregon, was
played by the, band.
Following President . Goode,, Governor
George fe; Chamberlain of the State of
Oregon was introduced. Governor Cham
berlain in a short address congratulated
the people of the State, the city of Port
land and the Lewis and Clark Corpora-,
tlon upon the achievement of an event so
notable in the history of the city and
State. i - \u0084
Hon. Jefferson My^ra, president of the
Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition
Commission for the State of Oregon,. was
enthusiastically applauded when he took
his . position on the rostrum to address
the people on behalf of the State Com
mission.
' Perhaps the most enthusiastic applause
which greeted any of the notable speak
ers of the day: was accorded George ; H.
Williams, the Mayor of the city ' of Port
land, whose eighty-two years of life have
not sapped the vigor of his youth nor de
tracted from his ability as a public
speaker. ,

Warford cast one look at the man and
turned away. The stranger laid his hand
upon the Treasurer's shouldfer and asked
the time of day/ and at the same time
edging nearer. Without waiting for fur-*
ther developments Warford drew a bis
navy revolver from his pocket and "com
manded the stranger to "get next.'J\ .

REFUGIO. Tex., June Lâ Mrs. Marie
Panches . and two little children were on
their way from the * Lucas ranch to
Blanconia yesterday when a pack of lobo
wolves came up behind . the buggy and
began barking. It was the first time
wolves had been known, to show such
boldness in this section and Mrs. Panches
at first thought that they were dogs.
They made an attack upon- the horse and
soon had that animal down. Mrs. Panches
used the butt of the whip. to defend her
self ; and two children.
The : wolves gathered around the ve
hicle and made leap after leap at her 'add
the children, their evident purpose being
to get them by their throats. Mrs. Pan
ches is strongly built and she. used the
clubbed whip to -good advantage. Every
time &: wolf sprang at her or- at the chil
dren, it v. as driven back by a well-di
rected blow, j * , â¢ -- I
There were possibly thirty wolves in the
pack : and an - the fight : progressed more
of them kept coming out of the thick un
derbrush T.-hich lines the road. â¢ Mrs.
Panches â¢ was in " ah almost - exhausted
condition,' when "Hank" Hendrix, who
carries' the United States man between
Beeville and Blanconia, drove up. A few
shots from his pistol scattered \u25a0 the pack
of wolves.". \u25a0 . l .
The woman had a piece of fresh meat
in her buggy and it is supposed the scent
attracted ibe wolves and caused the at

CARACAS. June I.â President Castro'S
message to Congress deals largely with
the American question. The Indepen

has been sustained. It is believed here
that the discussion of the question ha*
revealed the truth to the American
Government, as has been shown ' by
the measures recently adopted in Wash
ington, which are regarded as tending
to maintain the friendship" which Min
ister Bowen professed.
: It was held by President Castro that
any reconsideration of the finding \u25a0of
the arbitrator in .the Olcott or Orinoco
Navigation Company case, which has
been rendered in accordance with thÂ«
provisions of protocols, or any arbitra
tion of the Bermudez asphalt case while
It is pending in, the courts would mean
a. loss of Venezuela's sovereignty and
independence and is not to be consid
ered. The contract for the settlement
of Venezuela's funded debt to Germany
has been signed by Germany and will
soon be ratified by Venezuela. . Second
Vicp \u25a0 President Velutini is awaiting its
ratitlcation by England. Both realize
the great, importance of maintaining
the' credit* and peace of Venezuela.
If. Jhe national debts are compro
mised :i special session of Congress will
be called and a message will be sent In
v/ Castro recommending ..the ratifica
tion of the Velutini contracts.

that Venezuela is strictly fulfilling all
the terms of the Bowen protocol.

\u25a0 : LOS ANGELES, June Lâ For the firat
time in Its history Los Angeles is a 1;a 1 ; dry
town j to-night. S Unless a man knows .the
ropes better indeed than experts- know
them to prohibition centers it would be
impossible for him to get a drink for love
or ''money. Every saloon has closed ; Its
doors, every restaurant :. where liquor Is
served has | suspended that part of 'the
business, and after , theater diners who
have " been } accustomed to getting their
night-caps without question, had" to be
content -with strong coffee. The. only
places : where ''\u25a0 liquor is" for sale are' the
drug ' stores, * and - they, too,' have ; decided
for the time being to live strictly up to
the letter of j the law and sell only \on a
physicians' prescription^' ' x' " . ,-i- \u0084
This closing of the city to all liquid re
freshments was : the ' voluntary act of the
liquor -interests," and is intended as an
educational \u25a0 movement In connection with
the special election to~morr6W when the
people wiU decide whether the-city shall
become a prohibition town. EJvery saloon
man in the city entered the agreement,
and to-night '\u25a0'\u25a0 at 8 o'clock the â¢ saloons
closed. They -will not be -opened: again
until 9 o'clock Saturday morning.;/"'*
This Â£ action- will" Have a' double, 'effect
It will emphaslEe r > to .-â¢ moderate drinkers
the dffnculties attending tho getting of
"booae" â¢ in a ptohibiUqn , city, and it will
give the saloon employes an opportunity
to get out arid rustle for votes for their
cause. - No ' previous -\u25a0 announcement l of the
action Â« was- made, ; and no opportunity
given drinking men to supply 'themselves

There is involved . In this j. case ; a thing
that "is of greater ; value to some people
than gold, and that is .honor. Senator
Jones is a man whose name is written -in
the historyof this country, and In
cross-complaint -he \u25a0'\u0084 /has been \u25a0 accused.

say to you now that there is but oneway
that you can have jit In any - event, and ;
that , is ,by \ taking such action that the

"Well," said McGee, \ "there |ls|a I way

terest the result "of G.-H. Powell's in

Powell, who is a' pomological expert em
ployed by the Government atJWashlng

California -to give the fruit men ,of r thls .
State the 'benefit of Government service,
applied to their 'particular troubles. /, I
Mr. Powell arrived at the University, of j
California- to-day, and held extended con- !
sultations -with Professor E. W. Hilgard
and other members ; of the Agricultural
College staff. He has -just . come from
Southern California; where |he spent five
months, working with r the: citrus fruit
men, assisting them in the; work of-stor
ing - and "transporting the .'-'orange and
lemon crop, . and v experimenting , | with
transportation problems there. . It is esti
mated by ; the- citrus' fruit men. of -the
south , that,â through . the -work of -Mr.'-
Powell.there has been saved this season,
to the industry, from J200.000 ,to .$300,000.. v
Orange. growers have: been able; through
the .adoption of Mr. Powell's scientific
methods, to know what quality of fruit
should be . discarded and what should be
shipped. He found that about 25 per cent
of the fruit brought: from the orchards
for shipment' was. susceptible to loss or
deteYidration eh- ruote, and his methods
of detecting this percentage "of Imperfect
fruit helped : to solve the problem _ of less
enlng the loss. ' \ :-' '\u25a0
â¢ An experiment which resultedsuccess
fully was the" cooling" of a carload of
oranges to a temperature' of 40 degrees
before the journey eastward: was begun.
Hitherto fruit 'had been put . Into â¢ a re- \u25a0
frigerated^ar, and left to cool awhile en
route. The advantage of 'lcing "the car
and the fruit before the start was found
to.be apparent, and the experiment was
a success. '" .-\u25a0â¢., â¢
.-.The Government conducts this sort of
work ;at a dozen v different stations
throughout the coujitfy. Mr. Powell is to
continue ' the work in . Northern f Califor
nia, studying the problems that confront
the growers, and shippers of deciduous
fruits here.: He will work' In harmony
with the Government -experiment station
at the University of: California, and be
jefofrstantly In touchâ wtttr-trs- officers.

BILLINGS. Mont.. June I.â Henry Over
turf, a j young surveyor from \u25a0 San Fran-.
Cisco, was Instantly killed last night and
a companion whose name is : unknown
stunned so badly that for a time his life
was despaired of. : Overturf was a" mem
ber of a surveying corps at work on an
irrigation project near this city,-and'dur
ing a e t orni last night he and his com
panion sought shelter under a large cot
tonwood tree, which was. struck by light
ning. The bolt glanced : from one of ;the
limbs, striking Overturf in the . breast,
tore his coat and hat from his 'body and
one shoe from his foot.
A dark blue spot upon the left side. of
the body directly over, the heart showed
where- the elder boy was struck,' and the
younger evidently ; received the deadly
Btroke y on the head, as it was bruised and
discolored. '
The bova bad Just j returned from the
depot, where they . went to bid their fa
ther good-by. ; They/: were cutting the
weeds from around small fruit trees, and
when found about .. two . hours . after . the
storm were lying at least twenty-eight
feet apart. The ground was not * dis
turbed, neither did the trees nor shrub
bery show any Indication of the deadly
bolt which extinguished the two young
lives./ '\u25a0' ".. -. ' . ' . .; .-.;,- --: . '

â¢pcctal Dispatch to TbÂ» CÂ«IL
Salyatori Strano and Angelo Napoli
were \ arrested ; yesterday for , the murder
of Joseph Z Brogardo near ', Pietro \u25a0 Rala's
barber shop on January 22. J Ancio Brissile,
who is '; held at Â« the County j Jail ? for I the
crime, declared in the presence of Dis
trict Attorney Byington that Stramo fired
the , shot that ended I Brogardo' s life, and
that the murder- was the result of a plot
concocted ; by < Napoli and -other :\u25a0 embers
of<a^Mafla:or'secret society. \u25a0
Napoli, according to : Brissile, was - the
leader of the gang of Sicilians who gath
ered at Raia's barber; shop. There was
an old : vendetta^ between his family and
that 6f Brogardo. In 1- addition to this,
Brognrdo caused 'Napoli ,to be run' out
of an Alaskan fishing port. '
Napoll's. chance for revenge came j when
Brogerdo visited the' headquarters of the
Xapoll gang at Raia's barber shop. He
induced Strano, Brissile, Salvatori Alopia
and several others to start a false fight.
Ddmenlco â¢ Kossarlo, a " friend "of Brogar
dbr- attempted;* to - I ; lnterfere, \ but Alopia
held him.- Brogardo became terrified and'
rushed into the street. " Napoli.. Strano
arid Brlsslle flowed, drawing their \u25a0 re
volvers. There} was a fusillade and Bro
gardo fell mortally â¢wounded.- %-__ â -*' 'â¢â¢. *
'\u25a0 Brissile : 'wash arrested 'Immediately.
Strano w; -. captured and turned over to
two I men |to hold while the ! policeman
sought others of the ' gang. | Napoli -came
to: his rescue and Strano escaped.': â¢ -
: Shortly after Brissile announced that. he
would tell all he know â¢to the . police Na
pollvislted the -County "Jail -and' sent -a
card to'Brissile's cell.'. The card -warned
him to keep quiet. â¢ -'^ * â¢ ;: "'r^'i.
Detective Gibson and' the District Attor
ney Questioned Brissile' closely/as 'io T , the
possible connection between the^Brogatdo
murder and* the ; butchery of Bla^gio Vll-.
ar^o. They could get 1 no.^'lnformation,
though , the police are '^certain that the
society of which" Napbll, Strano _} and
Brissile are: members, plotted Vilardo's
death.,- Brisslle ; declares ' that - be . knows
nothing about it. V" â¢- â¢' .â¢\u25a0*- \u25a0>:\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0'
. Attorney Tread well has announced that
he will try to have Napoli released; on", a
.writ of habeas corpus. If .he Is success
ful .Napoli .will-, be ' arrested 'again : and
charged with murder. Strano and Napoli
were arrested - early yesterday . morning
near Meiggs wharf. '
Trachoma is a disease of the eyelid.
It is a germ "disease. , It can be cured,
say the Federal doctors, if taken in time.
If allowed to become chronic it is almost
incurable and' leads eventually to total
blindness. It causes little discomfort and
may exist for years before the victim is
aware of its presence. It may have be
come chronic before he finds it out, and
every wink of the eye may be j dragging
a across the eyeball
-and slowly but surely inflicting scratches
which, in time, wiU.destroy, the lens and
leave the V victim In . hopeless darkness.
One out of every five of the 'ltalian fisher
men at, this port ls. v s'aid to r be~ afflicted by
the disease: o In' New. York "city Its preva-"
lence among | school; children has caused
great alarm; and >at every port in the
country Federal doctors are t maintaining
a strict lookout for trachoma, which
flourishes freely In - lands where the sun
shines brightest.'; ' \u25a0â¢\u25a0\u25a0 '.-'\u25a0--\u25a0
'The Federal doctors declare,: howover,
;that the danger of infection from tracho
ma is very real and they . take strict pre
cautions to- avoid it. Four or five of. the
officers on; the Pacific Mail liner J Korea
are said to be afflicted with the disease,
contracted, the doctors say, from victims
among the passengers. The sufferer from
the disease rubs his ailing eye. \u25a0'':' He may
then, with the hand tha t did the rubbing,
grasp the hand rail leading from one deck
to another, transferring a few germs to
the rail. The next hand to grab, the trail
gathers up the germs and their, transfer
from hand to eye is< only 'a, matter of
time. ;--â¢%â¢ ;\u25a0\u25a0;. . . ...-\u25a0; , -" .
Dr. j Drew, not. having deported himself,
cheered up, threw * away the â¢\u25a0. strong as
tringerits with which he* had been.treat
ing 'his supposed, trachoma, and returned
to duty.' The case of the trachoma af
flicted interpreter has not been reported to
the quarantine doctors, who, "in view of
Drew's experience, place ! little faith in
Griffiths- diagnosis.
, When his eyes =\u25a0â¢ began to .'.: trouble him
some weeks ago Drew concluded, -, after
submitting f , the ailing lids to . the inspec
tion of the other Federal doctors, that he
had . contracted tracHoma. He - withdrew
from active .work and underwent a course
of , heroic treatment. >A* few, days ago* he
consulted I a "'\u25a0_ specialist "who told . me,".
said Dr. Drew yesterday, "you are bark
ing .up the wrong tree; don't ; worry;
there's no trachoma and no sign of it on
your eyelids." .'./;,.
Aliens Buffering from trachoma are not
permitted to . land .In the United ; States
and many victims have been deported on
this account. In some cases the deported
foreigner I has protested, . but mo i; appeal
has been allowea from the,Federal,doc
tor's diagnosis. ' From \u25a0 Doctor Drew's.ex
perience, however, .it would seem that
trachoma, does not wear a particularly
legible label. â¢ . v . . .
Immigration Inspector. David J. Griffiths
announced yesterday that one of the
American Japanese interpreters "In the
service \of the Immigration -Bureau \ and
tw6 of \ the Federal ; quarantine surgeons
had*- contracted s trachoma-- while in ,-th<j
discharge of their duty. "The surgeons" say
Griffiths ; is I dreaming and . that the only
foundation for eUch a statement is that
such a disease exists and that Dr. Drew
had a cold in his eyes, which at first" so
affected them that the man -of -medicine
feared he might have fallen victim to the
dread disease. ..Y-y :.â¢Â«â¢ f-V"Vi > â¢'-,\u25a0â¢ .\u25a0,-..:-â¢';;

â¢ >â CREDITS to the account of the depredating coyote are not
r â¢ -often reckoned at all; so we know him only by his debits,
7*a~L: which are.great. Yet the Agricultural Department in making a
study of the animal as an economic factor finds he does -a great
deal of good. Just to what extent he is useful in preserving the
balance of ! nature in the multiplication among wild animals is no
* doubt beyond the opportunities of the naturalist's bookkeeping, but
â¢ that he -will" be valuable in that way until we find other methods of
â¢doing the work now done by him in keeping down pests. more
'" pernicious than, himself is evident. How the balance of his account
stands may be forever unknown, but it is plain that' if he killed ten
jackrabbits a week and then came down to the farmhouse - early
Sunday morning and ate one egg, he would be reckoned an un
mitigated nuisance arid all his service^be forgot. .. . . . i:.\Si'-.-.
Although city people are unfamiliar with the coyote â have sel
dom-seen his face or heard his howl, he comes close home tp them
in his influence on their household economics. -He affects the price
of mutton to an' extent thatis distinctly estimable, and the harm
-he does by enhancing the cost of chickens, eggs, turkeys and ducks
can only be guessed at, but it is enough to demand his extinction.
In" some parts of the Southwest the losses to the flocks: of. sheep
â¢caused by coyotes amounts to the large sum _of 20 per cent. The.
average of his direct damage lo the flock masters is s,per "cerit,,biit
-.this v dods not begin to- show the greatness of his injury, because over
. vast areas the menace of his presence prevents the maintaining of
flocks at all unless in big bands that will justify the expense of herd
* "ers. This not only limits the output of mutton and wool, but the com
pact herding is a very great destruction to the value of the pasturage.
As we travel over the plains coyotes seem scarce, but that this is
only seeming is evidenced by the fact that last year Kansas alone
paid bounties on 19,514 coyotes. : Most wild animals are; killed; out,
or driyeh back,- by civilization, but the coyote likes it and thVives'oh
it, antK although he lives only on its edges, he finds that Hying more
varied and abundant than ever in his life before.:
' Perhaps the principal lessons of the study of the coyote's habits
and the estimates of his debit' and credit -accounts could^ be summed
up 'in saying that while his 'extermination T is',*desi|able, the /plans to
insure it f should not be so hasty and incomplete fasj to omit, compreh
ending in that scheme some way of \u25a0carrying on, after his .-death,
the good work he has been doing for'us in his efforts to make 'an
honest: living. : rS^ '.-I. 1 r :V,-. : ; ; >. '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'.\u25a0- ; ;' . _. ; \u25a0-'\u25a0-â¢ . :pi\ \u25a0 ;

of decency in office has become fixed in the States, and a Go/v- 1
fcrnor.who cast it off and fell below the established standard would
;*be : regarded as in the list with Benedict Arnold. It is one of the
"anomalies of. American sentiment that bad city government has
.been so common that the people have become tolerant of it. Some
treat it as a- matter of course, and not. worth protesting against.
Now/ "however, the belief is general that unless we have- reform

complex system and the whole' will finally become corrupt. This
"conviction leads. good men to combine ,in the effort, not merely to
confine the plague, to its present limits, but to eradicate it within
those limits', lest it spread. . _.-V. -V
Moral and physical epidemics have common characteristics.
They -may long lurk in a small space until conditions favorable to*

They have seen the moral pestilence leave its bounds and
/appear in one branch of. the State government. They have seen
. four of their State Senators expelled from the body to which they
"were elected. 'They see one resting under sentence to the peniten
tiary and another waiting the same fate. They have seen corrup

city government, and they have sounded the tocsin to* alarm the'

From every part of the city come recruits to the League. Its
'progress has been so steadily forward that the prospect is that when
the primary- comes off it win -have the'field to itself. This prospect
will cause no relaxation of vigilance. The grafters are, now in
diplomatic negotiation oÂ£ alliance's. They must not be underesti
â¢ mated. They have at stake the loot of a city. They are capable of
making a show of respectability in non-essentials, and of making
these appear as essentials. They can affect an air of repentance and
*a desire to* put their hands to good v/orks. There is no art of craft
arid cunning that they will not use.
* - The League is prepared for all their pretenses and shams, and
it* will stand to the end as it started, capable of penetrating allde
'ciits, and offering the only rallying ground for all citizens who are/
at jone with its. purpose, which is the reform of municipal govern-
# .nrent M until San Francisco shall have fame as the best governed city
'in* the country. This is the high mark at which the League aims.
'.This city" has set a' bad' example in government. If the League
/prevail it will henceforth set a good example, and pilgrims will come

*-pHAT ths work and influence of the Republican League _are
I felt and feared by the common enemy is shown by the effort
1 that is made to gossip it out of the way. The latest effort is,
to identify it with the Citizens' Alliance, which claims to be a non
political, .non-partisan body, organized for the purpose of securing
industrial equilibrium and for no other purpose. rectification of
municipal government has no relation whatever to that equilibrium,
only aiadly'frighttned politician can pretend to see any connection,
relation, or common cause between these two bodies.
*' * The* League has no ulterior motive.- It has no secrets from the
public... .lt has made proclamation of its purpose and is seeking its
achieyenienC openly and aboveboard. Its intention Js to secure a
proper primary and to elect delegates to the Republican city con
vention who will make of it a deliberative. body, which will do its
duty by the jnomination of a ticket which will command the support
of eyery conscientious Republican and of every independent citizen
who believes that the welfare and the future of San Francisco are
involved in 'the -character of the" municipal government! That is
what the political ringsters fear, when they pretend to be afraid of
the Citizens' Alliance. -The League's purpose is part of the great
movement that is felt all over the country. It is part of that im
pulse which elected the present Governor of Indiana and the Gov
ernor of Missouri, and that in Philadelphia, is holding up the .hands
;of Mayor Weaver in his fight with the Pilgrim band, composed of

BOBBT MITCHEUL liad ideas of his
own* dbout ' a. wedding and a honey
moon, and he â¢ was so ; original and
so nice Â£ in presenting them to Doris
Maynard that she fell in with them
quite naturally. â¢' " v .
Accordingly, Bobby chartered a spe
cial car for the wedding party, after
securing the sole use of a little tavern
| not a great distance; from the city} for
the festivities. â¢ It waa merely a ques
\ tlon of opening the house a week or
two before - ; the regular ' season began,
and _aÂ« Bobby had ' all the /money/ he
needed to produce results' the 'bargain
was effected without difficulty.
It was a very merry party that went
down on Thursday noon to the place
where everything was to be done. The
car waa filled with the friends of Bob
by and Doris, with the kinsfolk of both
parties contracting, and among them
was Dick. Mercer, who was to be best
man.
Doris had a, sister' Mary, who no
longer lived with her father and mother
in the city, but was practically adopted
by a wealthy maiden aunt. She was to
be the maid of honor, but she did not
go down. with the party. -Her train
came in from the other, direction about
an hour after, the other. .
Dick Mercer had heard a great deal
about Mary. Maynard,: and on the way
down he heard . still more. The more
he heard the more he made up his mind
that She was a girl worth knowing. She
was pretty to the point of distraction.
She was thoroughly well educated and
her education had not dimmed her nat
ural sprightlinees. She was full of fun
âeven to the point of mischiefâ in
short, the sort; of girl know, .and
not least, in Dick's opinion; because
she was. old enough to have sense: \
Mercer determined on all these ac
counts that he would wait for Mary,
whom he had never met, at the station
and let .the rest of them drive over, to
the hotel. She was the maid of honor,
he was the best man, and it was mani
festly his duty to provide her. with an
escort. . It .was an hour's drive from
the. station" to the hotel, and he was
urged to let some one else take hia
placeâ the other men were suspiciously
willing, urging that he was to act as
toast master at the dinner that would
be found ready for them, and the like
â but he. held, his ground like a man.
He secured a buggy from the numerous
rigs that were at the station waiting,
and his hour passed quickly and with
pleasant anticipations.
The first glimpse of. Mary Maynard
justified all that had been said about
her. The hour's ride, did even more.
They were as chummy as if they had
been friends for years. The rest of , the
party had finished dinner, so the two
had a little dinner by themselves, and
became still better acquainted. Dick
was having the time 'of his life.
The next morning the bridal party
had a rehearsal of the ceremony in. the
little chapel of the town after they had
breakfasted and walked to
gether. The 'wedding, was at high noon
and there was ltincheoh afterward. As
soon 'as this was -ended the bride. and
groom drove away, followed by , a
shower of rice and slippers. What their
destination was they would, not .tell;
and as there were two railways within
easy reach and two ways to go on each
there was a lot of guessing. ;
The rest of the party was to return
to the city on "the special train, and,
the new Mrs. Mitchell had supposed
that Mary was to go to her old home
for a visit. So had Mary herself. But
Dick, who was ge.tting more .interested
every minute, persuaded her to wait
for the, next train and go back with

love that all. of nature bore him,, and
through the . devotion of the gods and
goddesses who deeply mourned his death,
that he was "restored to 'life; and there
after, so the story goes, the mistletoe was
given into Freya's care, and every one
who passed beneath the bough of It she
held kissed her. as a sign that now it was
an emblem of love and not of death.
The mistletoe is most interesting to me
as a student of love, however, because it
represents a not uncommon type of af
fection, that egotistic love, wholly selfish,
which feeds upon the strength of an
other, giving nothing in return except the
acquiescence \ of j Its | presence â a parasite,
whose very attractiveness is a reproach.

Tax Collector Scott has thought out
a 'plan whereby the United Railroads
will be compelled to pay a license tax
on every street car which it* has in 'use.
â¢ During ex-Tax Collector'- Smith's in
cumbency it was discovered ' that the
corporation was paying, licenses on all
of its cars, and the system of collec
tion thereon w<as- so. lax that Smith, was
enabled . 'to .appropriate some - $2500
which he. collected from the treasurer
of the -company, ostensibly for street
car licenses. -â¢'\u0084
The system which Scott "proposes to
lnauguarte Is to have metal license
tags j placed, conspicuously on the cars,"
so they, may be In plain view of the li
cense collectors. The system is used
for dog licenses, and underwit it. will
not be possibl e for any crooked work
to be done, as the Auditor will have the
metal tags in his -possession to be dis
posed .of as fast ' as they are required for
sale 'to : the railroad company.' The
tag* will tte ; numbered and will bear
the, name of the - street-car lfne for

Dear Mrs. Pinkham:â
" Loss of strength, extreme nervousness

roamed at large. ; Thelr impounding â¢
was -not, therefore to be*, avoided -^y:
him and .he asks for a refund: of the
money. Subsequent testimony of* John

he would pay him $15 a week. After
one week, he says, he refused to pay the
money and twÂ» weeks later his cows were
seized. . â¢
; Supervisor Brandensteln held that al

There was no home run punch in the
eleventh spasm I yeeterday to , save the
Commuters at Recreation Park. They
waited and waited for something to show,
but their vigil was all in vain. In. the
, meantime the Tigers were busily engaged
' In copping runs.. Their hits arrived Just
when hits were needed, so the four runs
that came through were expected. Scoreâ
Tacoma 4, -Oakland 0."
Just to have something to argue about,
Cap Van Haltren protested the game in i
the ninth round. Eagan was at^the bat, i
and when a fast one cams through he
tried to sidestep It. Instead the ball wal
loped the bat, and "according to all base
ball etiquette it was a strike. Mr. Bray
said "baH," and the protest followed.
Graham advanced to the pan and. said
he would be satisfied to' let it go as a
foul, but .the umpire stayed by his ruling
and a "ball" went, and so did the pro
test. â¢ .
It was a Tacoma game from bell to
bell. Oakland never, figured when Thom
as got wound up right. The windup pe
riod began In the first spasm and only
terminated when the game was at an
end. The Tiger batters had their lamps
trimmed about right when they igÃaw": a
chance to make runs, so the tale of the
game hinges there. ,'i _, -
Nordyke singled during the third and
Eagan bit off a double that was out of
Sheehan's clutches. McLaughlin died
easily, but Lynch punched one out past
Strelb that brought both runners through.
Eagan and McLaughlin both singled. ln
the seventh. Truck was nailed In trying
to pilfer third. Lynch then swung
through for a three-sackcr and McLaugh
lin arrived at the plate.'
.The Tigers made another on that dis
puted I strike of Eagan's -in the ninth.
After two had been called on the Ice
Wagon Kid he landed one out to Cook,'
who dropped the balL McLaughlin laid
down a bunt and Graham smote a slow
| one to center that brought Truck through.

Corbett put the finishing touches 'on
his training yesterday afternoon at the
Ocean Beach. He "took two good spins
on the road and devoted some time to
shadow boxing, and gymnasium work.
He went to bed last night weighing 130
pounds, so the. fears of hie admirers
were allayed, as they are sure the
Denverite wrll be fit to-night. He con
tinued an ,8 to. 10 choice throughout
the day in what little wagering waa
done on the'outcome of the fight.
Hanlon was practically at weight last
night, and to-day he will do . nothing
but take a short walk and prob/fbly a
drive in Jhe afternoon. He engaged in
light gymnasium work yesterday, rtiorn
ing and in the afternoon' drove about
Alameda in a' buggy. He â¢ will' come
across the bay ( this afternoon and will
spend most of' his time before going
to the ringside at his' home. - *
Silly Jordan, the Veteran , master of
ceremonies, stated last night that Jim
Jeffries; the man who retired on his
laurels,. will be. introduced to-night just
before Hanlon and Corbett hook up at
JV'oodward's Pavilion.- Billy . will ipre
sent Jeff, "as the greatest fighter the
world has ever produced and the man
wHo quit -the game without a' single de
feat being rendered against him. The
big lellow.is sure to get a great recep
tion. . ,' .
, Shaughnessy is placed in an awk
ward position. No charges are made
against him, and- lie is undoubtedly an
efficient referee. lie did \u25a0 not seek the
job. but had it thrust .upon him. He
aaw no reason why he should not act,
aod accordingly took up the "burden in
good faith. * " . \u25a0.
All went well till a story Was circu
lated that Hanlon did not want Shaugh
nessy and only took him to avoid trou
t>le. The wise ones. at once began to
talk. When Shaughnessy heard what
was in the air he immediately hunted
up Greggains and handed in his resig
nation. . All parties - concerned â¢ then
seemed in a sympathetic mood and
lauded Shaughnessy" to the skies.
\u25a0 Shaughnessy wrottf a letter to Alex
Greggains explaining that he did not
try to cut in on the job, but took it
only after the rival- boxers -selected him
after being unable. to agree upon any
one else. â¢ He thanked Corbett and Han
lon for naming him judge" of the' con
test .and- regretted the affair, came to
pass as it did.
Owing: to a general warÂ« \u25a0of dlssat
lsfaction on all ' sides, Mark Shaugh
neasy resigned as referee of the Corbett-
Hanlon flght jrestcrday. 'and after a
lengthy conference Ned Unman was
\u25a0elected to do the honors. Shaugnnessy
waa very much hurt when a rejKJrt was
spread broadcast tbat be was not the
tight man. and be acted' in a sports
manTlko manner by passing up the Job
without delay. . *
When Shaughnessy " resigned Man
Â«gers Dan Hanlon 'and George Weeden,
representing the boxers, were in the air
aa to wbom they should select. They
met, Alex Greggalns of the promoting
club and bad a long talk on the sub
ject. They could, not agree for some
time, so when the name of Iloman was
.mentioned it seemed to soothe the feel
ings of both and they Quickly agreed
On him, ' .. . .........
Homan could not be located offhand,
but when Alex Greggalns 'finally got a
line on him he consented to act with
out 'making any- excuses. Both man
agers seemed satisfied with the man
named and both said . they were sorry
the trouble- over Shaughnessy arose, as
the latter seemed to be quite-' the proper
person. 'â¢

NJSW TORK. June I.â Judged by the vol.
* ume et trar.nactlons - to-day not much impor
tance would attach to the day's stock market.
but the extent of the reduction in prices ef
fected by to-day's operations must be allowed
considerable significance as accounting for the
speculative attitude toward values. To a. large
extent the results of the day \u25a0 reported simply
a retreat from the professional commitments
to the . long side of the msrket which were
Dace yetterday. Specl&c disclaimers of some
of the unauthorised rumors upon which ad
vances were aCected had something to do
with the chance of position. A sense of-dls
Â«atlÂ£?sct*on with the meager response from
any outside sources to yesterday's demonstra
tion was a factor to-day. The greater part of
the changes in prices was eSected pretty
â¢ prompflyÂ»a* the trading began and represented
a revised estimate of values as roach as an
actual result of relative supply and demand In
the market. Prices gave way promptly on
light cffarlnsi and when, the .level .had been
touched \rhich was Judged to be appropriate
to the nerw opinions the market sank Into apa
thetic dullness and suffered little from pressure
of liquidation. There was IÂ«tle resiliency,
however, and no effective new demand was at
Â»tracte<J fey the cheaper prices. .There can be
no -doyto .of the importance attached to the
Equitable L>f* controversy ns an unfavorable
factor in the .market. A larre psrt of the
cay'e discussion . centered upon that subject
and the closeness with which the tenor of the
forthcoming report of the Investigation com
.mittee was guarded left room for a wide range
of surmises over its character. Some of these
end the - Inferences of the results to follow
were disquieting- The stock market has had
e.bunfiant experience In, years past of ." the
amount of mischief that can be done to values
of F-vuritlea by the working out of personal
animosities and antipathies of powerful capi
talists. There Is some feel in* prevalent that
the Equitable Incident, coupled* with a number
of recent hank failures, has had the effect of
prompting to a "course of hou?ec!eanlng among
financial Institutions generally- and to an over
â¢hjuiline of resources and their standing. The
desire to -know the results .of. such. a process
may very probably hayÂ« Its part. in the we.it
tnc attitude which Is now pronounced (n flnaa
*-i circles. The day's news from the crops

require the . Tax Collector to mark
"paid" upon the assessment roll of 1904
the taxes amounting: to "J4OS6 paid by
him on April C,' 1905, to' ex-Tax Col
lector Smith, who cashed them and

ney's opinion is. desired, as the taxes
paid, by the Southern Pacific Company,
E. W.- Hopkins aud W. J. Somers are in
the same category. The \u25a0 committee
thought Kohn's taxes should be
marked "paid," as he held duly re
