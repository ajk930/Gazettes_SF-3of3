ST. PETERSBURG. April IS. â The
ovrful disaster to the battleship Petro
pavlov*k at Port Arthur, v. ith the loss
of almost her entire crew of more than
600 men and the death of Vice Ad
tniral Makaroff, has been a terrible
blow. It would have fallen less heavily
if the ship and the commander in
Â« hifcf of the fleet had been lost 'n bat
tle, but that it was the result of an
other accident following upon the
heels of a succession of tragedies of
vhich'the Port Arthur fleet has been
the victim has created something like
a consternation.
. The press learns that the location of
six xnines planted by:tbe"Yenesei were
unknown, the charts having ' been lost
when that vessel was blown up. Prob
ably it was one of these mines that the
battleship struck. |P$tfi

The San Francisco CallThe Teaser was built at Cowes, Isle
of Wight, in 1892. Her measurements
are: Length 200 feet, beam 14 feet,
draught 5.5 feet, displacement 320 tons.
She has an Indicated horsepower- of
4500. She has two torpedo tubes and
her armament consists .of one 12-pound
er and five 6-pounder, quick firing guns.
Lieutenant Ernest' A. Richart (junior
grade), was attached to the' Cleveland

the time < of the disaster- as an. umpire
during 1 target practice. ; He was > a:na

Lieutenant William C. Davidson
a native of Ind'ana and was appointed
a midshipman from South Dakota,
September 28, 1891. He was graduated
from the Naval Academy in 1895 and
assigned to the Olympla. He was pro
moted to ensign July 1, 1897; to" lieu
tenant (Junior grade) July 1, 1900, and
Heutenant June 16, 1902. He was as
signed to the, Missouri when she went
into commission and was serving as a
turret officer at the tlmÂ«> of his death.
His wife, Mrs. Julia Davidson,, resides
at 1003 McCulloch street, Baltimore,
where a telegram was sent from -the
Navy Department, announcing the
death of her husband; -. : Lieutenant
Davidson served on -the Alliance,

The smokeless powder is put into
the twelve-inch grun in three sections,
each bag or section weighing 120
pounds. Some officers say that the
turrets of the Missouri had no bot
toms and express the opinion that
after this accident the turrets of all
battleships will be equipped with bot
toms for the protection of the men in
the handling-room underneath.
The officers of the Missouri were
especially well known in Washington.
Captain Cowles served as Â¦ assistant
chief of the Bureau of Navigation and
most of the officers killed were widely
known here.. Both Midshipman Neu

have been engaged to be married. It
is said Midshipman Neumann was to

the rapidity of big gun fire. I fear we
have permitted our enthusiasm to get
the better of our judgment. It would
seem from . the dispatch that-, not
enough time had been allowed to
elapse between the firings. It is only
recently that we have permitted the
breech to be opened almost the mo
ment the gun was fired, and in so do
ing there is necessarily a risk. Ap
parently all but three men in the

"The Missouri accident is -too ap
palling to. discuss. But I fear, that en
thusiasm in making world's records
has led us past the danger line. In
It can be stated that officials of the
department for more than a week
past, while rejoicing in the world
breaking, records in target practice on
our warships, have feared Just such
sn accident as. has occurred on the
Missouri. -A -'naval expert to-night
said:
Captain John E. Pillsbury, assistant
chief of the bureau of navigation, re
mained constantly at his desk and with
the other officers of the bureau and a
clerical force started arrangements to
care for the bodies of the officers and
men. Secretary Moody is preparing
a dispatch of sympathy to be sent to
Roar Admiral Barker, commander In
chief of the North Atlantic fleet, re-
Questing him to convey to the com
mander, the officers and men of the
Missouri the profound sympathy of the
department.
With only the brief dispatch " from
Admiral Barker telling how the acci
dent occurred, all the officials of the
department, from Secretary Moody
down, hesitate to attempt an explana
tion of it. The fact, however, that
three rounds had been fired and an
other shell had been sealed and two
sections of powder rammed home when
the explosion occurred In -the opinion
of an official of the department would
lead to an inference that the accident
might have been caused by some pow
der from the previous charges which
remained in the gun when the third
charge was put in. .
WASHINGTON. April 13.â The entire
Navy Department is stunned by the
appalling catastrophe on board the
Missouri. The bureau of navigation has
been active since the first news of the
accident reached here, "shortly after 4
o'clock- Although the commanding of
ficer of the Missouri, Captain W. S.

To-day "El Campanil." the beauti
fur mission bell tower at Mills College,
will be dedicated with elaborate cere
monies. Large numbers of guests, for
mer pupils and graduates of the col
lege will go over on the 12:30 o'clock

The tower was presented to Mills Col
lege by Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Smith, and
the bells, whose sweet tones â rang out
the fleeting hours at . the Midwinter
Fair have been given by David Hewes.
Strongly suggestive in outline is the

roseate bower, the twain were made
one, the solemn ceremony having been
witnessed by relatives and a' few inti
mate friends. Attended solely by the
winsome Miss Mabel Hogg, gowned in
pink chiffon cloth and bearing pink
roses, the bride presented a bewitching
picture in her nuptial robe, of embroid
ered crepe, with exquisite' settings pf
duchesse, and rose point lace.' -From
her pretty head fell a voluminous veil
of tulle and in her arms she bore lilies
of the. valleyâ sweet symbols of con
stancy'. ? . . .:
The groom was attended by EdAyard
de Laveaga,, a brother. Mr. de Laveaga
is a clever fellow, a University of Cali
fornia graduate and is rated as one of
the wealthiest young men in the city.
The destination of the young people,
who will, leave this morning for their
post-nuptial trip. -is,, of course, a secret
locked deep in their. breasts. On their
return they will reside in this city.
Last night as the town clock tolled
the hour of 9 Miss Florence Callaghan,
fair daughter of Mrs. Daniel Cal
laghan, became the bride of J. Vincent
de Laveaga.; Owing to the deli
cate health of the mother of the
bride the nuptial service was per
formed by his Grace Archbishop Rior
dan at her residence, though it was
much regretted that a wedding at the
high altar of the cathedral was not
possible, .the. solemnity and beauty, of
the service was not perceptibly marred,
for the home was made glad, with the
blossoms of spring, great branches of
budding bloom spreading above and

had Just reached there when the more
terrible explosion in the handling room
occurred, which burned and strangled
them to death.
Lieutenant Davidson, the officer In
Captain Cowles caught up a dying
bluejacket in his arms and staggered
to the deck with him. The bluejacket,
with two others from the handling
room, had crawlod partly from their
place of duty when they had been
overcome. Before the fumes of the
burring powder had left the turret
officers and men were laying out the
dead and dying men. Three minutes
after the explosion all were on deck,
and the surgeons from the Missouri.
Texas and Brooklyn were attending to
those not dead. The twenty-five men
of the turret were found lying in a
heap. They had started for the exit
when the first explosion occurred, and
In loss than five seconds after the
first explosion two streams of water
were being played in the rooms, and
when volunteers were called for every
man responded, eager to go into the
turret and rescue the crew. Captain
Cowles grave his commands calmly,
and but for his presence of mind and
that of the officers of' the ship the
Missouri would have gone down.
The second explosion occurred near
one of the magazines, and so hot was
the fire that the brass work of the
magazines was me'ted. Smoke and
the fumes of the burned powder made
it almost impossible to enter either the
turret or handling-room, but tjfflcers
and men, with handkerchiefs over
their faces, made efforts to rescue- the
men inside. Leading the rescuing
party was Captain Cowles. The offi
cers endeavored to keep him from go
ing below, as men fell unconscious as
they entered and had to be pulled out
by their comrades: but, unheeding their
advice, the commanding officer rushed
below, followed by Lieutenant Ham

responded, and the magazines and
handlmg-rooms were flooded with
water.
The breech was open, and a thud j
pave notice of something unusual. No
other report was made, but flames were
seen to leap from every portion of the
turret. A few seconds later another
explosion, somewhat more fierce, oc
curred. This was in the handling
room, where 1600 pounds of powder,
or four charges, ready to be hoisted

successful detour he was enabled to re

Detective Cody was detailed on the
case, but failed to find foundation for
such a charge as Price would pre
fer. The murder theory is utterly dis
credited by the police.
Against Price's statement, is a state
ment made by Lloyd to Dr. Kucich. a
surgeon at the Emergency Hospital on
the morning of the accident, a few
hours prior to Lloyd's death. Lloyd
stated at that time to the doctor that
he was sitting on the window sill in
the hall of the building and must have
been in a trance, lost his balance and
fallen headlong to the next building
below.
This remarkable statement was
based merely on conjecture. Price im
plicates a prominent lawyer residing
in the Mission, but has no proof to
back his statement. Price 6ays that
Lloyd told him he expected to have
trouble with the man who had pur
chased a clock from him and refused
to pay for it. The man who purchased
the clock was a business man having
an office in the Donohue building.
Price alleges that Lloyd went to the
sixth floor of the Donohue building on
Sunday night to get a payment on the
clock. He says that Lloyd must have
then got into an altercation with the
man and been thrown from the win
dow.

Jones was Interrupted by Galnea of
Tennessee, who asked if it were not a
fact that ex-Secretary of "War Root
was the attorney for the railroad com
pany to be benefited by the guarantee.
"It did not," replied Jones, "concern
him who was the attorney, but it was
a fact that the Philippine Commission
was being urged to grant railroad
franchises to English and Belgian cap
italists without the guarantee."
At 5:30 p. m. the House adjourned.
Â¦ VCA SHINGTON, April 13.â The Sen
ate to-day began consideration of the
bill providing for the government of
the Panama canal zone. The greater
part of the day was occupied by Mor
gan in support of amendments offered
by himself. None of them were ac
cepted, and the reading of the bill was
nearly half-completed. ; Morgan at
tacked the new Panama Canal Com
pany and contended that the United
States should proceed to- carry into, ef
fect the provisions of the treaty with
Panama regardless of the demands of
that company. As the reading of the
bill proceeded Morgan suggested vari
ous amendments, but none of them
were accepted.
At 4 o'clock, when the reading of the
bill had been about half completed, it
was laid asidt?. and after passing 219
pension bills the Senate, at 5 p. nx, ad
journed.
Under a special rule the House to
day devoted itself- to the consideration
of a bill amending the law relating to
the Philippine Islands. The provision
in reference to the granting of railroad
franchises and the guaranteeing of 5
per cent on the cash capital actually
invested in such railroads was opposed
by Jones of Virginia, who alleged that
British and Belgian capitalists were
ready to build the roads without such
guarantee.
Jones in opposing certain features of
the bill said that if it was passed as
now drawn it would increase the bond
ed indebtedness of the Philippines by
$6,000,000, making a total of $27,000,000.
He said that as the result of the fall
ing off in the customs receipts of the
islands the people were less able to-day
to incur such indebtedness than they
were a year ago. He denied, as Cooper
claimed, that the only way to secure
prosperity in the Philippines was to
guarantee the interest on capital in
vested in railroads there, and said that
th^e bill was not one prepared by the
committee, but. was the bill of the War
Department sent to Congress to be re
ported.- He would rather, he said. see.
the railroads in the Philippines built
by British than by American capital if
the Filipinos were to guarantee the in
terest. Â¦ ?
Attorney PUlslmry Claims'
Client Did Xo Wrong, but
Erred Through Negligence
Â» -â
The trial of Lieutenant Frederick B.
Niclson, who is charged with dupli
cating his ;>ay accounts, was concluded
yesterday before the court-martial at
the Presidio. The arguments and evi
dence are now before the court, and it
rc&s with that body to hand in its
verdict when it meets again on Friday
jnÂ»rning at 10 o'clock.
The first witness called when the
court convened yesterday at 2 o'clock
Â¦was Nathan Boas, who testified again
relative to the manner in which he fcd
vanctd money on Lieutenant Neilson's
pay accounts for the month of May,
find how Noilson had assigned the a.c
coubts to him. He also stated tlttit
Nt'ilpuii had given him a note for the
amount of $146 60. which he had prom
ised t<Â» pay to him or remit to him
tram Manila on or before June 25. 1903.
N*rÂ» money had been forthcoming at
that time from Neilson, so Boas stated
that he had sent the pay account to
the paymaster at Manila some time
etrty in July. The paymaster had re
turned the account, with the statement
"that there must be some mistake in
the matter." In November Neilson's
brother. \V. B. Neilson of Philadelphia,
had remitted the amount of the ac
count to Boas, and that squared the
matter so far as Boas was concerned.
Thr next witness called was William
H. Comcgys. paymaster of the Depart
ment of California, who gave evidence
Jn a general way as to the methods of
doing business in the paymaster's de
partment.
In ih^ meantime answers to the in
terrogatories which had been sent to
W. D. Neilson in Philadelphia were
read. They were simply documents
stating that the letters which Lieuten
p.nt Neilson had written to his brother
on June 11. l?03. while in the Philip
pines, requesting him to pay the
amount due Boas, had never reached
him. The documents farther conveyed
the information that had the letters
reached him he would have paid the
B.CC0U&t at once.
PILLSBUKY IX)R DEFENSE.
H. D. Pillsbury. for the defense,
etatcd that all the trouble was due to
negligence: in fact, he summed up his
line of defense for the accused by stat
ing that the position the accused was
placed in was entirely due to lack of
precaution. He said that the pay ac
cuunt which* was made over to Boas
vas= run. a bor.a fide account. Boas
haa received a note for the amount
of the loan, and he simply held his al
leged pay account over Neilson's head
as a Hub to make him pay the note.
Ncilson, he said, had in no way hy
pothecated the pay account in the
sor.se of the word which was used in
the charge against him. The accused
has already been under arrest thre* 1
ard a half months. He was guilty cf
PO crime and had made no attempt to
defraud the Government. He was sim
r>!y guilty cf bad judgment and a lack
of business methods.
Attorney Pillsbury then referred at
length to the fine character that his
rlicnt had always borne, not only in
the army, but in his previous career.
lip dwelt at great length upon the high
standing of the different officers who
had testiTi^d regarding that character.
He eurr.med up the whole argument
by stating that it was neglect and ac
cident, and he entreated the court to
Â«-<>nsid<?r the previous fine record of
the accused when they were delivering
sentence.
Captain Clarence E. Dentler. judge
advocate of the court, summed up the
case briefly and concisely. He said in
part:
L.'Â»utrnant Neilson on April 2S. 1903. assipned
Vie May Â«c<-ount to J. Boas and promised tf>
jay tfc<? tamr en or before June 25. He <1I<J

Irpin^s. Accus-ed hivcrelt etateg that he aE-
FicnÂ«-d fcin pay account and that he also gave
tbc morey- lender a. note to cover the amount.
CLAIM AGAINST USTTED STATES.
Jur.t- 23. 1903. at th* account had not been
*'iuarf<l by Neltson. it became a claim against
th* L'nu'd State*. Boas had waited until
July and then wrote to the paymaster gen
eral in Manila, but was advised that taere
v a mistake. Boar then prc-seed his claim
It i> true the cialm has since been paid by
Neiltm's brother, but that does not alter the
fact that duplicate account* were drawn, and
the accused muft have known that in view oi
these fact!" he would be dishonored ln the
eyet of his brother officer* and the world.
The case was then submitted to the
court, which immediately adjourned to
meet on Friday morning at 10 o'clock,
â¢when a decision will be handed down.
Lieutenant Neilson is now under ar
rest in the post, his wife and child be
ing with him.

The rule was established to prevent
collisions. It is reported that ferry
boat captains are inclined to ignore
the regulation.
A delegation from the Board of
Trade waited on the commission yes
terday with a view of expediting the
work of building a stairway from the
grand nave to the Board of Trade ex
hibit rooms. It was decided to ad
vertise for bids according to plans pre
pared by Architect Wright and ap
proved by the commission. It is ex
pected that the new stairway will be
finished before the Knights Templar
from the East arrive in San Fran
cisco.
The of $62,616 31 in revenue
from dockage tolls, wharfage and Belt
Railroad is significant. Chief-AVharf
inger R. J. Welch is firm in the en
forcement of rules relating to wharf
age and much of the increase is due
to his diligence. At a meeting of the
Harbor Commissioners yesterday tho
secretary was directed to notify trans
portation companies and other owners
of steam craft that the following rule
of the board must be respected:
"Vessels propelled by steam must not
run inside of a line five hundred feet
distant from and parallel to a line
drawn through the outer ends of the
piers."
thJnrnhf/m L % conf ronted more and more with
increa^nl frÂ° P rov ' dln B berth room for thÂ»Â»
â¢""'^ of shore, coastwise and bay and
business. In this connection it may be
Â«?fpn d (^, M c: '- nortun Â« > t"ne to direct your
attention to the proposed bond issue of $2,000,
t 'i, W V U te to the people
nlJ?* general election in Xovember next
This amount will enable the board, to ex-
IV*^,, Â¦ Beowal1 rr Â°m Its present terminus
S,,^ 1 ?^" to conne Â« with the section
P C m!T* bullt ncrth fron> Channel street, and
to bulid some ten new modern wharves
As the payments for both interest and sink
ing fund of these bonds are to-be met from
the ordinary revenues of the board, their is
suance will not b* a burden In any way to
the people of the State, and should be cham-
F'oned esj^oially by all who are interested
hinni* lmri â¢.y e , ment an Â«l enlargement of the
shipping facilities of the port of San Francisco
BEIU'H JIOOM XEEDED
The chief engineer has been directed to pre
pay plan? and fpeciflcations for four new
Pljw to be built along the line of the seawall
ntJ*T under construction. These wharves will
each be 11H) feet in width by }<0O feet in length,'
and will be the embodiment of all that is best,
most modern and permanent in wharf structure.
The board hopes to e-ee its way clear to
award the contract for one of these piers.
The board has in contemplation the paving
with basalt blocks of that portion of East street
from near North Voint street to the west line
of Fowell street, a distance of about 14DO feet,
the same to be paved for a width of 37 feet.
This is a much-needed Improvement and will
greatly accommodate that rapidly growing
manufacturing nnd warehouse district, and the
con will be about $15,0C0.
In January last the- beard, finding that it
had a large amount of funds available for the
I>a> ment of deferred payment drafts, resolved

PARIS, April 13.â The terrible dis
aster that has visited the Port Arthur
fleet may have grave consequences for
Russia. Admiral Makaroff had raised
the spirits of the sailors, and, although
not in favor of taking the offensive, he
constantly went out to meet the en
emy's fleet and seemed bent upon fall
ing unawares upon the Japanese naval
forces escorting troops, in case a land
ing should be attempted by the Japan
ese on the shores of Liaotung Gulf.
It is allowable to believe that it was
this dangerous prospect which up to
now prevented the Japanese scheme to
land on the northwest or west coast of
the gulf. . } :' ;;â¢
To-day the Russian squadron at Port
Arthur is diminished by one of its most
formidable* fighting units, and he who
inflamed the Russian tars with thrill
ing enthusiasm is dead. It would seem
that the boldness of the Japanese will
now increase beyond all bounds and
that the disaster of April 13, already
bo" poignant in itself, may have for the
Russian army the same consequences
as the loss of a great naval battle. . Â¦

Alford W. Cooley, United States
Civil Service Commissioner, accom
panied by Elliott. H. Goodwin, secre
tary of the National Civil Service Re
form League of New York, arrived
from Washington yesterday and he Is
at the Palace. Commissioner Cooley
has been making an extended tour over
the civil service circuits of the West
and has included in his' travels visits
to Denver. Salt Lake and Reno. From
here he will journey southward, stop
ping over in Fresno, Los Angeles and
other important towns in the South
west. The purpose of Mr. Goodwin's
trip to the coast is mainly to organize
civil service reform associations in the
various districts established by the
Federal commission, 'his theory being
that these organizations can aid : . the
local boards of examiners and Impress
on the minds of citizens the need of
better State and municipal regulations
for civil service. As editor of "Good
Government," a New York :: monthly
published by the National Civil Service
Reform League, . Mr. Goodwin Â¦ has de
voted much/space .to the need of ; civil
gervlce reforms, and by strong argu
ments he has produced convincing
proof of the fact that civil service has
done much to elevate the standard of
State and municipal . governments by
eliminating the "spoils" system from
politics.
Last evening the distinguished visit
ors were the guests of the Commonr
wealth Club at a dinner given at .the
Palace Hotel, and, Saturday, they .will
be given a luncheon by the members
of the Union League Club. Meantime
they will be the recipients of much!at

cials and Inspected. the quarters of the

atrioon the Admiral withdrew his bat

"It was an inspiring spectacle to
see how this magnificent fleet maneu
vered. It was the most powerful in
dividual fleet that ever sailed the
Eastern seas, consisting of forty ves
sels, including the torpedo division.
The battleships went in boldly, while
the less protected* vessels maneuvered
with them, conforming to their evolu
tions at a safer distance. ,
"Although I went closer than ever
before, I saw no sign of the Russian
ships. I could, however, make out the
lighthouse. The Japanese were man
euvering at eighteen knots and appar
ently suffered no damage, while the
! expenditure of ammunition was small.

"The battleships now hoisted their
fighting flags and steamed In the same
formation, the Mikasa leading and the
new ships bringing up the rear, to
within six miles of Port Arthur's
frowning promontory.
"At 10:20 o'clock the shore batter
ies opened, but the flre was only des
ultory and it seemed as though Vice
Admiral Togo was making a demon
stration rather than a bombardment
"Last night we ran into dirty, rainy
weather. At 4:30 o'clock this morning,
amid the rain squalls, we sighted a
squadron. As the light increased it
proved to be the Japanese fleet of six
battleships, followed by a first-class
cruiser squadron 'of six ships in line,
the third and fourth being the Kasuga
and the Xisshin, which were marking
their first appearance with the fleet.
With the Mikasa leading, the vessels
were shaping their course for Port Ar

The death of Admiral Makaroff is

PARIS, April 13. â The disaster to
the Russian battleships Pwtropavlovsk
and the drowning of Vice Admiral
Makaroff caused consternation in Rus
sian quarters here and made a deep
impression everywhere. The Foreign
Office and the Russian and Japanese
representatives had not received of
ficial advices on the subject up to this
hour, and were dependent upon the
press reports.
The Chefu report that a battle fol
lowed Admiral Makaroff's sortie led at
first to the belief that the Petropav
lovsk was sur.k in an engagement, but
this view of the loss of the battleship
vas changed when later press dis
patches wore received.
Loss of Vice Admiral Makaroff an Ir

The wretched condition of Korea s
finances is evidenced by the fact that
the War Office is without funds, and it
has been compelled to order the pre
fects along the routes taken by the
Korean troops on their marches to the
north to victual and supply *the sol
diers without compensation. In spite
of this condition the Minister of Pub
lic Instruction has proposed edu
cational reforms and the re-examina

such reforms is of long standing, and
few results from the new proposals
are expected.

The general opinion is that Maka

When Admiral Makarbff visitedfhe
United States at the date named he
went to Newport, where he met Ad
miral Taylor and Captain Converse at
the War College and Torpedo School.
Captain Converse says that from first
to last be showed the highest powers
of observation and he criticized intel
ligently every detail of the process of
making smokeless powder for the
navy, which was then being developed
at Newport naval station. At that time
the station was making smokeless
powder in the shape of long strips,
which were arranged like fagots in
the carriage case. This form is now
in use in the Russian and French
navies and there are signs of a dis
position-on the part of the United
States navy to return to its use. It
was abandoned principally because of
the difficulty of drying the strips eo
as to keep them from warping.
Admiral Makaroff inquired how the
strips were dried straight and Captain
Converse told him that this was oc
complished with difficulty by placing
weights upon them while drying.
Makuroff explained that his process
was better. It consisted in forming
the strip with a small hole in one end
and hanging it while drying from one
of many thousands of hooks in a suit
able building. The plan is practiced
to-day.
WASHINGTON, April 13. â The news
of the death of Admiral Makaroff
caused a profound sensation in naval
and military circles here, for he was
probably better known than any other
Russian naval officer. This was be
c.iuse of the fact that he had visited
the United States in 1S96-97 and also
commanded the Russian North Pacific
squadron. w.hich brought him into fre
quent contact with American naval of
ficers in those waters and sometimes
took him into American ports on the
v.est coast.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 14.â What
has been the issue of the combat be
tween Rear Admiral Ouktomsky and
the' Japanese fleet, or whether a fight
has actually taken place, is not known
in St. Petersburg: At 2:30 o'clock this
morning the commission of censors ad
journed after announcing that no fur
ther news had been commuicated.
The Official Messenger received a
dispatch at 6:29 o'clock from Prince
Ouktomsky, but whether it was sent
before his departure in pursuit of trie
Japanese fleet or after his return the
editor of that journal does not know.
Despite official and private dis
patches, the belief prevails that many
details of the catastrophe to the Pe
tropavlovsk have been suppressed by
the Admiralty. The reinforcement of
the enemy was the controlling reason
for "Makaroff's return to Port Arthur,
but a factor in this decision also was
undoubtedly the plan of campaign not
to engage a superior force or run the
risk of damage to his ships, but to
wait patiently for the arrival of the
Baltic squadron. . ,
Last night ended the celebrations fol
lowing Easter Sunday, which in past
years has been a time of gayety and
feasting, but the terrible news from
Port Arthur has plunged the city into
the deepest gloom. ââÂ«,!â
The Novosti this morning glowingly
eulogizes Vice Admiral Makaroff, re
calling the vigilance and persistency
with which he patrolled the sea in en
deavoring to induce the Japanese to
engage in combat. The paper says:
"In Russia the news of the untimely
end of the brave commander calls forth
deep grief. The death of the experi
enced, warlike and gifted admiral,,
whose authority was recognized every
where, especially in a land of sailors,
England, is in the highest degree.re
grettable. The bitterness is lightened
enly by the knowledge that the admiral
died at the post of duty and that the
fleet has other gifted officers who will
prolong his grand activity.
"In any case we have got -to reckon
immediately with the consequences of
the catastrophe. Above all, it is ex
pected that the Japanese will hasten
to take advantage of the catastrophe
and renew their attack on Port Ar

LATE NEWS WITHHELD.
One rumor is to the effect that Rear
Admiral Molas was among those killed
aboard the Petropavlovsk.
It is rumored at Plymouth that the
Hamburg- American line steamship
Peutschland, which arrived at Cher
bourgh-yesterday from.New'York, has
made her last Atlantic voyage 'Â¦' and
that she will be purchased by Russia.
The editorials also extend sympathy
to the Russian nation in the series of
misfortunes which have pursued the
navy, and comment upon the enormous
advantage this catastrophe gives to
Japan, even if the Russian disaster is
hot worse than reported in the official
dispatches.
No actual news has yet reached Lon
don beyond the Russian official tele
gram, but dispatches from Weihaiwel
induce the confident belief here that a
naval engagement occurred off Port
Arthur of a severe character, and that
later telegrams will show that the Rus
sians suffered a severer loss than is
admitted.
LONDON, April 14.â The late Admiral
Makaroff spoke English fluently and
was well known in Englani, especially
in the Newcastle-on-Tyne district,
where he resided while the Armstrongs
were building his ice breaker, the
Ermak. His courtesy and social quali
ties made him very popular and the
editorials in this morning's newspapers
deplore his loss with genuine sympa
thy,-paying tributes of .admiration to
the way he met a hero's death in
carrying out his own oft-expressed
conviction that "he who wishes to in
sure victory should determine either
to conquor or to die."

admiral's fate it is recalled that the

trfficial dispatches. A requiem mass for
the repose of the souls of Vice Ad
miral Makaroff and the other officers
and seamen of the Petropavlovsk has
already been announced to take place
in the Admiralty Church to-morrow.
The following official dispatch has
been received here from Rear Admiral
Grigorovitch, the commandant at Port
Arthur, addressed to the Emperor:
â¢PORT ARTHUR, April 13.â The Pe
tropavlovsk struck a mine, which blew
her up and she turned turtle. Our
squadron was under Golden HilL The
Japanese squadron was approaching.
Vice Admiral Makaroff evidently was

"The enemy's fleet has disappeared.
ST. PETERSBURG. April 13.â It is
now believed that the mine which sank
the Petropavlovsk had drifted cmt of its
original position. The latest estimate
of the number of men who lost their
lives is 800. .
"According to reports from the
commandant at Port Arthur, the bat
tleships and cruisers went out to meet
the enemy, but owing to the enemy
receiving reinforcements, . making his
total strength thirty vessels, our
squadron returned to /the roadstead,
whereupon the Petropavlovsk touched
a mine, resulting in her destruction.
Grand Duke Cyril, who was on board,
was saved. He was slightly injured.
The whole squadron then re-entered
port. The Japanese are now off Cape
Liaoshan. Xo reports had been re
ceived from the acting commander of
the fleet up to the time this dispatch
was sent."

regret to report to your Majesty that
the Pacific fleet has suffered irrepar

capable commander, who was lost, to

Another dispatch from Viceroy
Alexieff to the Czar says:
Rear Admiral Prince Ouktomsky has
assumed command of the fleet."
The following dispatch to the Czar
has been received from Viceroy Alex
ieff: : Â¦-?,<#;?:
Vice Admiral Makaroff inaugurated
his command of the Russian fleet with
a complete change of tactics. When
Vice Admiral Makaroff enjoyed the
reputation throughout the length and
breadth of the Russian empire of be
ing a dashing officer, delighting in bril
liant achievements and bold, aggres
sive action. He was given the sobri
quet of "The Cossack of the Sea," and
when he went to Port Arthur to take
command of the Russian warships in
Far. Eastern waters great confidence
was felt from the fact that the direc
tion of Russian naval operations was
in good hands. The command of the
fleet was given to Vice Admiral Maka
roff when the command of the neld
forces was given to General Kuropat
kin, and both officers were to operate
in harmony with Admiral Alexieff, the
Russian Viceroy in the Far East.
- Vice Admiral Makaroff reached Port
Arthur early in March," and he was at
once heard from. On the morning of
March N ll the,, Russian . torpedo-boat
flotilla ]eft Port Arthur and attacked
the Japanese fleet. One Japanese tor
pedo-boat was resorted to have been
sunk in this engagement, and it is
known that the Russians lost a tor
pedo-boat destroyer, the Stereguscht
chi.
Makaroff originated the idea of con
structing the famous ice-breaking
steamer Ermak, which was built on the
Tyne from his designs.
Since his appointment to the com
mand of the Russian Pacific fleet
Makaroff has shown himself to be a
man of great courage and energy.
Early in March he personally went to
the rescue of a Russian torpedo-boat
destroyer which was hard pressed by
the Japanese, and inspired the naval
forces under his command with a great
deal of enthusiasm. He passed Easter
on board a guardship at the entrance
of Port Arthur, and every night per
sonally supervised the precautionary
measures adopted to prevent the Rus
sians being surprised by the Japanese.
The last engagement previous to the
fight of to-day in which Makaroff took
part occurred on March 27, when he
gallantly repulsed the second attempt
of the Japansse to ."bottle" Port Ar
thur.
Vice Admiral Makaroff was appoint
ed on February 26 last to the command
of the Russian Pacific fleet. He was one
of the heroes of the fighting on the
Danube River during 'the Russo-Turk
ish war. Makaroff and Skrydloff, who
have since many times been honored
by their Government, were at that time
lieutenants in the Russian navy and
volunteered to make a night attack on
a powerful Turkish ironclad. With^a
torpedo-boat they .succeeded in blowing
up the Turkish vessel, and, it was as
serted at the time, thereby made the
first, successful demonstration of tKe
usefulness of torpedo-boats in modern
naval warfare.
ST. PETERSBURG. April 1Z ;~
The definite announcement that Vice
Admiral Makaroff was drowned has
cast a gloom over the entire city. It
is generally believed that he will be
succeeded by Rear Admiral Rojest
vensky, who was slated to command
the Baltic squadron, and that Vice Ad
miral Skrydloff, commander of the
Black Sea, fleet, will be placed in com
mand of the Baltic squadron.
he saw the flight of the Stereguschtchl
he went personally to her rescue and
attempted in a most brilliant manner
to Bave her. .
His direction of the Russian opera
tions on March 11 was.believed to have
rendered the Japanese efforts futile. '
When the news of his successful ex
ploit at Port Arthur, so soon after his
arrival there, was known in St. Peters
burg he became the hero of the hour.
His name was on every tongue in the
Russian capital and he was loudly ac
claimed, and many predictions of bril
liant conduct and successful initiative
were made for him.
Makaroff's ideas -concerning war
ships ran counter to those of many
naval experts. One of his pet aversions
was armor. He was ever outspoken in
hiy criticisms of heavy battleships,
wftlch, he contended, placed too many
eggs in a single basket and he always
showed his partiality for a fleet com
pased of a large number of swift, un
armored cruizers, armed with heavy
guns and attended by an unlimited
number of torpedo boats.
When the Russian Emperor sent
Vice Admiral Makaroff and General
Kuropatkin to the Far East he said
in a telegram to Viceroy Alexieff :
"I have found it expedient to send
to your assistance General Kuropat
kin for the direction of the land forces
with the rights of army commander,
and Vice Admiral Makaroff for jthe di
rection of the sea forces with the
rights of fleet commander. I am con
vinced that the appointment of th*Â«e
independent, responsible commanders
in chief will enable you as my lieu
tenant to discharge the difficult and
historic task which has fallen to your
lot."'
On March 29 Vice Admiral Makar
off sent the following dispatch to the
War Relief Society at Kronstadt, Rus
sia, from Port Arthur:
"Last night was a very hot one. but
we cannot hope form very quiet time,
either now or in the near future. I

FEATURES OF THE DAY.'S NEWS FROM FAR EASTERN WAR
Admiral Makaroff and 800 men lost their lives by the destruction of the battleship Petropavloysk at
Port Arthur yesterday. Grand Duke Cyril was wounded. The (Usastcr was caused by a Russian mine.
The squadron was returning to the harbor after having stolen out to meet a Japanese fleet, whose re
inforcement caused the Russians to retreat; without fighting. The Petropavlovsk . struck; a mine under
Golden Hill and turned turtle. Prince Ouktomsky, acting commander of the Russian squadron after the
disaster, was reported to have engaged the Japanese fleet yesterday afternoon, but no confirmation of Uic
rumor was obtainable. . , . ,Â¦Â¦Â¦*.-.
The Petropavlovsk was the third Russian warship at Port Arthur to be blown up by accidental con
tact with a mine, the two others being the torpedo-boat Yenesei and the cruiser Boyarin. Tire cause , of
Uiese frequent disasters is thus explained: At the" time of the first Japanese attack upon Port Arthur,
before Uie declaration of war. the Russians wenv wholly unprepared and riot even the channel leading to^
the harbor was mined. After that attack the work of mining the harbor was conducted with such haste
that a number of the mines were carelessly placed and afterward shifted their position. One of these was
struck by the Yenesci, which sank with all on board. On the Yenesei were the charts showing the loca- . .,
tion of Uie mines placed by that vessel and the loss of these, together with the death of the officer who had
charge of the work and- whose .knowledge was invaluable, left the situation as dangerous to the Russian
fleet as to that of the enemy. â¢ , ; - i ., : . -^ .
Skirmishes along the Yalu River took place on April 10, 11 and, 12. The Russians lost five killed In

adopted a resolution sanctioning the

Secretary Brodrick in introducing
the resolution read a telegram from
Colonel Younghusband, ,the political
agent at the head of the mission, to
the effect that Colonel Macdonald, in
command: of the escort, reached his
goal, Gyangtse, Tibet, April 11 .with
out the loss of a man. The telegram
added .that the . Tibetans were highly
demoralized and were fleeing from the
Gyangtse Valley, that the Chinese del
egate was . coming in and that- the
Tibetan delegates were on their way to
Gyangtse.
Brodrick proceeded to defend Brit
ish action, saying that while. the Tibet
ans were trying to circumscribe their
relations with India, they simulta
neously -were attempting to open :. up
relations with Russia. The. British
Government ' could not acquiesce . in
any change in the status quo in Tibet
nor countenance an attempt on the
part of any. foreign government to es
tablish a predominant interest there. -'

WASHINGTON, April 13.â The case
of James. A. Watson, accused of em

by the discharge of the jury and the
arrest of one of the Jurors, Arthur L.

trial probably will not be begun again
until the middle, of May. The termi
nation of the case was precipitated by
the request ; of Orrison * to . be informed
by the court whether Watson was to
be tried on the indictment against him
or on public : opinion: Justice Pritch
ard replied that public opinion had
nothing to ; .do with the jury, which
was to consider only the law and the
evidence." Â¦
Assistant District Attorney Taggart
moved, the discharge of the jury on
the ground that Orrison's question in
dicated a prejudice . against the Gov
ernment In-th'e case. The court prompt
ly discharged the jury, prefacing the
action by saying "that the juror is In
toxicated, and not in condition to sit
In 'the box."
When Â¦â¢â¢. the, juror was brought into
court Justice Pritchard adjudged Orri
son in contempt of court and sentenced
him to two months in Jail. \

CHICAGO, April 13.â Ways and
means to bring success to the Demo

part of the country, at the . Iroquois
Club banquet at the Auditorium to
night ln celebration of Jefferson's birth
day. Tariff reform, antagonism to
trusts, independence for the Philip
pines and rigid economy in public ex
penditures were some of the sugges
tions offered by the speakers to bring
about this result. A feature* of the
banquet was the following letter from
Grover Cleveland, who had j been in
vited to attend, but was. unable to be
present:
I very much regret the necessity which
compels me to decline your courteous Invita
tion to attend the celebration of Jefferson's
blthday under the auspices of the Iroquois
Club. It is especially fitting at this time of
confusion ln political ideas and misapprehen
sion as to the meaning of true Democracy
that the character of the great exemplar of
Democracy should be fully appreciated and
that his political opinions should be better
Interpreted and uoderstood. His devotion to
the Interests of the people, his wise conserv
atism, and his constant adherence to the
public good, always the guiding star of his
career, commend his acts and his beliefs to
the careful study of those who in these days
patriotically seek the welfare of our country
through the ascendency of safe and sane De
mocracy.
The Premier added that the strictest
supervision would be exercised to pre
vent agents from holding out improper
inducements to prospective emigrants.
BUDAPEST, April 13.â In the lower
House of the Hungarian Diet to-day
Premier -Tzima made a lengthy state
ment" regarding the proposed extradi
tion law. which he said would be In
troduced In a few days. It was not
intended to promote : emigration, but
to surround emigrants who absolutely
ref usfed to ; remain ln Hungary with
governmental protection and keep in
touch with them 'with the view of their
ultimate return. Owing to the.',de
mands of the steamship companies the
Government- had intended^ to institute
a line under state control, but, in the
meanwhile a contract had been con
cluded with - the Cunard line. . .The
terms provided for a ten years' con
tract, terminable by notice at the end
of five' years or in the event of the
emigration, falling below 50,000 persons
it shouldbe canceled at the end of the
third year. In the event of the United
States prohibiting immigration the
contract was void. The Cunard com
pany undertook to make twenty-six
trips annually from , Flume to New
York, I accommodating 2000 immigrants
per trip. Should the total be less than
30,000 persons the Government agreed
to pay 100 kronen (about ?20) per head
deficit. The Premier said that, the
Government would gladly pay the pen
alty because it would indicate a fall
ing off in emigration.

report from Japanese sources states
that the Japanese reopened the bom

This, action evidently followed the one
reported earlier in the day. ' ,
A private dispatch from Port Arthur
says the Japanese attacked, that place
at daylight yesterday and that the
Russian fleet, assisted by the fire of
the forts, drove off the enemy. The
dispatch adds that the town was not
damaged." The effect of the bombard

mentioned.
WEIHAIWEI, April 13.â The British
gunboat Espiege, which arrived here
from Newchwang,. reports. that at 5:45
this morning she sighted five Japanese
warships engaging the Russian cruiser
Bayan, which was making for Port Ar
thur from the direction of the Yalu
River. The Askold and another cruis
er with three funnels came out of Port
Arthur to assist the Bayan. At 6:45
the Russians got under the shelter of
the forts, but the Bayan was evidently
damaged, as quantities of steam 'were
seen escaping from her. At ~$:05 the
Japanese ships "opened fire with their
heavy guns upon the forts, but the
latter did not reply. After a fifteen
minute bombardment the Japanese re
tired toward the east.
It is rumored here to-night that, fol

Rear Prince Ouktomsky, act

According to later reports Grand
Duke Cyril was more seriously Injured
than at first believed. He has been re
moved to a hospital at Port Arthur for
treatment. Despite the statements in
the dispatches the Grand Duchess
Vladimir believes that her son is dead,
saying:
"Everybody has been killed, and I
cannot believe that Cyril was saved."
It is said that Viceroy Alexieff will
assume comand of the naval forces in
the Far East, presumably pending the
arrival of Rear Admiral Rojestvensky.
No details as to how Admiral Maka
roff met death have been. received. It
is said that the Grand Duke Cyril
owes his escape- to the fact that he was
on the bridge, whence he leaped into
the sea and was picked up by a boat
from another warship.
was due to the fact that the vessel was

"From every point of view," says the

"Admiral Alexleff's dispatch makes
this significant addition: 'The full

ever, seem to have deliberately played
upon Admiral Makaroff's; enterprising
nature to lure him into ; a . fated trap,
probably among the Miaotos Islands.
"Admiral Togo's command was pres

the flagship met its fate.
"There is thought tor.be -.a singular
absence of assurances as to the condi

safety of all except the Petropavlovsk.

"The loss of the Russian flagship ap

action at sea in the open. The Rus

ported as being some distance off land,
mostly to the south, between the end
of Liaotung Peninsula and Chefu, and
the report that a new searchlight had
been erected on the tip of Liaotung
seems to corroborate this idea. So it
seems that Admiral Togo determined
on fleet action, and I think it will be
found when the later telegraph conies
LONDON, April 13.â That Admiral
Marakoff fell Into a trap set for him
by Admiral Toga is the . thory which
Loridon^is inclined to build upon, the
few facts so far known- regarding the
Russian disaster at Port. Arthur.
At the news of the death of Vice Ad
miral Makaroff himself no expressions
save those of eympathy and regret for
the loss of a brave man and a brilliant
officer are heard. Rear 'Admiral Inglis,
who knows Admiral Togo personally,
writes ln this morning's *Daily Tele
graph:
"We know for a certainty that no
one deplores Admiral Makaroff's loss
from a personal view more than Ad
miral Togo, and if the, gallant Rus
sian's body could be found a'nd rever
ently buried by his foes it is quite pos
sible "the Japanese Emperor himself
would have attended the ceremony."
Of the circumstances which preceded
and possibly led up to the loss of the
Petropavlovsk, Rear Admiral Inglis
says:

one word of the engagement of. the
Bay'an and the Askold with five Jap
anese .warships told of In the Weihal
wei and Chef u dispatches. Why is this
concealed and is it the whole of the
concealment? It must be assumed that
Admiral Makaroff : came out in chase
of the five Japanese ships which ." had
been worrying the Bayan, and that
they had led him on Â« with admirable
judgment. Â¦
EVERY 'VESSEL DAMAGED.
'"Finally an Italian agency. Issued,
upon the authority of its representa
tive at Chef u, a sensational report that
Admiral Makaroff's escape was cut off
among the Miaotos Islands. The Rus
sian squadron was surrounded and
every vessel was damaged."
It looks, according to the Dally Mall,
as though the Japanese had stolen in
behind 1 the Russians and dropped some
contact mines off Port Arthur, for it is
difficult to believe the Russians can
have been so careless as to lay electro
contact mines. '
Fred S. Jane writes in the Daily
Chronicle: "Some time ago Admiral
Togo claimed to have laid blockade
mines off Port Arthur. This claim was
probably a bluff, designed to make the
Russians think that -none had been
laid. The actual laying. is very likely
to have taken place the : other night,
when the supposed bottling expedition
took place." .
Spencer Wilkinson in the Morning
Popt agrees with the theory that there
was a sea fight; that Admiral -Maka

presence of a very large Japanese force
and had to retreat.

The Mill-owners' came
back with the assertion that the min
ute any men were called out they
would close down every mill in Ala
meda County. Now. the Building
Trades Council is in the fight. J. B.
Bowen, business agent of the council,
said to-nipht:
"The mills will be kept open, no
matter what action the District
Council of Carpenters sees fit to v take,
and the men will be protected. The
threat of the carpenters to call out
the men is an empty one, for not half
the millmen would obey the call."
OAKLAND, April 13. â Another
phase of the old fight between the
Building Trades Council and the Dis
trict Council of Carpenter! developed
to-day when the Mill-owners' Associ
ation received notice from the carpen
ters that unless the four men who
were expelled from the Miilmen's
Union for remaining at work during
the recent strike were discharged from
the mills where they are now employ
ed the millmen in those mills would
be ordered out. .

upstairs room of the' library building
at the University of California to-day.
A corps of orrmious looking professors
stood guard over them and kept their
wards' noses down to the areas of
white paper in front of. them for six
long hours. These eight martyrs to a
system of pedagogic espionage were
the candidates for the first Rhodes

papers and prepared :to forward them
to Washington, fn accordance with in-

ins? his hands with pieces of glass.. His
face and eyes miraculously escaped
the fragments of glass which were
blown the full length of the large
laboratory, room. The . unfortunate
athlete was given medical attention
at, once, but it is feared that the cuts
are so deep that they will not be suf
ficiently healed to allow him to enter
the annual collegiate track meet. â¢
Hunker is still guarding his castle
on Bancroft way, .fearing that Mrs.
Carroll may turn up at any time, and
make another successful storming
party of it.
Now I am out in the world without a dollar.
Ai: I have If my little son, whom Hunker
promised t.. support ar.d educate. But I have
other resources, and when 1 appeal to the law
again 1 talnk there will be a different story
to tell. 1 think I will get the beEt of him yet.
Even that would have been satisfactory, but
he kept the lease. As he had the upper hand.
I could do nothing. I asked him why he had
become so indifferent toward me and he said:
"I have nothing to Â«ay to you." Finally he
bued out a writ of rectttution for the house,
and. ri course, defeated me In the courts.
Mrs. Carroll is the woman Hunker
ejected from the home he built for her
at 2428 Bancroft way at a cost of
$20,000. She said the house was an
engagement gift and he denied this.
The court took his side and sent two
deputy sheriffs to Berkeley to. take
care of the case. When the deputies
got into the house they found that
Mrs. Carroll had been there before
them and taken all the movable furni
ture in the place.
Hunker spoke his mind about this
proceeding and now it is Mrs. Carroll's
turn. She came to Berkeley to-day
to hunt up mouthpieces. She was
quite agitated over it all and once or
twice was moved to tears. This is her
side of the story:
Hunkrr ha.- treated mo cruelly and hu
miliated me. His <!Â¦ niul that I am his coueln
ehowK what kind of a man lie is. I met him
in San Franritco and told him my maiden
name was Hunker and we traced the rela
tionship. It was satisfactory to him. . "â¢
On the strength of our kinship he loaned me
$:c,o00 to build a house. I was to build it
and then lease it irons him at a nominal figure.
It was understood that I was to pay the taxes.
But after the house had been built and I had
moved in he began to change toward me. A
week dffo he dragged me over to his attorney
and m&de me tign a lease for ten yean at the
rate at (40 a month.
Now Mrs. Christine Carroll prances
into the limelight and gives the world
a piece of her mind concerning one
Andrew Hunker, discoverer of Hunker
Creek in the Klondike, who is esti
mated to be a millionaire many times
over. In her eyes the millionaire is
the picture of ingratitude and selfish
ness. She promises that there will
be trouble when she gets her breath
and sticks her talons of the law into
his hide.

"I feel that the city cannot afford to
lose Mr. Howard," said Mayor Olney
to-night. "and I should feel disappoint
ed if it shall become necessary for me
to appoint his successor. He is run
down and must take a rest. He-be
lieves there. should be a representative
in his place during his absence. I hope
the Council -will vote him a leave of
absence to cover the time he shall be
away."
Mr. Howard left to-day for Victoria.
There he will join his wife and
daughter for a tour of Europe, expect
ing to be away about three months.
In the City, Council Mr. Howard has
been conspicuous as the exponent of
clean-cut business methods. He has
made exhaustive studies in the water
question and was foremost in arrang
ing the bond issue programme. As
chairman of the auditing and finance
committee, Councilman Howard's work
was that of a master hand. He is
president of the Western Fuel I Com
rany and one of \ the representative
commercial men of the Pacific* Coast.
*But it is hot certain that Mr. How
ard will be permitted to resign. The
Mayor is anxious that the city shall
not lose the services of the gentleman,
and an "effort will be made to retain
him. As soon as Mayor Olney was
notified of the resignation he decided
to take steps toward inducing Mr.
Howard to stay. The Mayor suggested
that the Council should not accept the
resignation; but should grant Mr. How
ard the leave of absence necessary to
cover his projected three months* trip
abroad.
City Councilman John L. Howard
has placed his resignation in the hands
of Mayor Olney and the City Council.
Pressure of private business affairs
and ill health are the reasons Mr.
Howard assigns for his action in re
tiring from the city government. The
necessity of going away for a time
also led Councilman Howard to re
sign, for. he declared, to his callers,
he believed his place .should be. filled
in view of the public business now Be
fore the Council.

OAKLAND. April 13. â A writ of at
tachment was issued by Judge Greene
thiÂ«s afternoon for the person " of
Charles W. Pa!m, who is ordered to
be brought into court and punished
for contempt in not having paid over
to Jennie M. Heaton the sum of $2020
belonging to the estate of the late
Warren D. Hoaton. It was promised
for Palm by Attorney Henry C. Mc-
Pike that the money would be paid
on last Monday. With this under
standing the matter was allowed to
go over, but the money was not paid.
The claims of Jennie M. Heaton
have been contested for years by Palm
as executor of Heaton's will and At
torney H. C, McPike. Heaton died
and left a valuable estate. A claim
was made to the property by a woman
said to be a child of Heaton's. born of
a woman in England with whom Hea
ton had lived. She made her con
tention good before the lower courts
and the case was appealed. By one
appeal and another the matter has
been kept alive for many years. Now
Palm is in his last ditch, the court
holding that he has passed the limit
in further resisting its mandates and
has adjudged him guilty of contempt
and ordered him to be punished. Palm
is said to be in Los Angeles.

HUNKER'S ACTS
DISPLEASE HER
Miss Heald read a great deal of late
and had shown signs of mental trouble.
.Â».
Mrs. Blanchard learned ' that there
was nothing but mud flats at the foot
of B street yesterday afternoon, the
tide being so low that it did not cover
the short. The police accent the the
ory that the letter was written by Miss
Heald. The incoherence that marks it
indicated the writer's disturbed mind.
Mrs. Blanchard said her sister had been
cheerful during the day and left home
about 3 o'clock, saying she was going
to walk.
Miss Lillian Heald, SÂ» years old, a
short-story writer, disappeared yeeter;
day afternoon from the residence of
her sister. Mrs. Sydney Blanchard, S55
Thirty-seventh street, under circum
stances that have induced the Blanch
ards to. appeal to the police for assist
ance in search for the missing woman.
Within a few hours after Miss Heald
departed a special delivery letter was
received by Mrs. Blanchard, signed by
'"Mrs. William Raymond" and declar
ing that a woman answering Miss
Heald's description had been seen to
drown in the bay off B street. The
facts that the handwriting of the mes
sage closely resembled that of Miss
Heald. that the description of the gar
ments were identical with those of. the
absent sister, that Mrs. Blanchard
never heard of a "Mrs. William Ray
mond," that the letter was received so
soon after Miss Heald's disappearance,
all lead Mrs. Blanchard to believe that
for some unexplained reason Miss
Heald had written the letter.

There were no issues involved in the
fight except the candidates themselves.
Decoto -wanted to retain the office he
has held for two years, and Woolsey
wanted it, too. Thd office carries a
salary of $100 a month and the tenure
is two years.
There was a close fight on all the
other offices, and, as" in the case of the
graduate managership, nobody knew
until the last vote was counted how it
would turn out. The vote of the other
candidates was as follows: For presi
dent of the Associated Studentsâ L. D.
Bishop 33S, W. H. Dehm 483; for vice
presidentâ J. A. Force 361. A. C. Keane
469; for secretaryâ K. C. Gunn 425, Law
rence Kennedy 370. There were 833
votes cast.
*
After one of the fiercest fights in col
lege politics Ezra Decoto defeated A.
J. Woolsey for the office of graduate
manager of the Associated Students at
the University of California. Decoto
won out by the narrow margin of eight
votes, the total number cast for him
being 417, against his opponent's 409.

Rabbi Isadore Myers, who .recently
resigned as pastor of the Congrega
tion- Ohabai Shalome, was presented
with a beautiful illuminated addres3
by the members ; of the congregation
yesterday. The address is elaborately
gotten up and is full* of praise and
thanks to the venerable rabbi, who
has labored for more than seven years
in the interest of his congregation.
The members of the synagogue regret
to lose such a zealous leader as Dr.
Myers and in -the pamphlet which they
presented to him they desire to thank
him for the good work he has per
formed while rector of the synagogue.
To him is given credit, for establish
ing the voluntary choir, the ladies'
benefit society and the flourishing con
dition of the spiritual school for the
children is attributed to his efforts.
A committee has been appointed to
make arrangements for a grand testi
monial benefit to Dr. Myers in the near

THANKED FOR HIS LABORS
One of the witnesses to-day will be
Charles Augustus Johnson, a freckled
faced youth who was an office { .boy in
Hyde's office, and is expected to tell
how he carried bunches of affidavits
and deeds to a notary's office, where
that official affixed his Jurat or ac
knowledgment without seeing the per
sons whose names had been signed to
the instruments in blank.
At this point the hour for adjourn
ment arrived and J the examination
broke off just like a sensational novel
in the stc-ry papers, as Commissioner
Heacock said, "To be continued, in our
next." A big crowd/will probably be
on hand this morning; to hear the rest
of Harlan's Confession- and to listen to
Heney driving it in with his cross
examination., In this peculiar case the
defendants are bringing out the evi
dence aganst themselves by calling the
Government's own witnesses,' and ail
that Uncle Sam|s clever counsel has
to. do is t to develop some additional de
tails. In this way the defense is slowly
getting hold of the main points of the
Government's case.
This sum of $200 was sent, me by Bens.on
In a letter. The money was wrapped in brown
pai>er without writing, and the envelope was
addressed to R. I. Smith, box 102. Tacoma

dress had been I agreed upon by Benson and

Valk together and they made their ' agree

"No: he knew it would be of no uee.
He owed me the money and so I Just
>didn't pay the note."
"Did you over get money fram any
persons besides Benson and Collits?"
asked Commissioner Heacock.
"No." 1
â¢"Oh. I think it was the day before
the note came due," answered the
naive witness.
"Y\*as it a one-day note?"
"No: it was for sixty days."
"Did Collins demand payment?"
"After a certain number of Collins'
selections had been approved I asked
for the money due. but he declined tÂ»>
pay until his whole list was passed,
and therefore I stopped advancing l;5s
cases. None of them was afterward
approved except In the regular order.
Afterward, hvwever. I Induced him to
lend Â»me $150/ And gave him my note
for the loan."
'Toil never intended to pay it?" said
McEnerney.
"Yes, I did; I expected to pay it out
of money coming from Benson."
"When did you change your mind?"
THK XOTE TO COLLINS.
Even a long-drawn technical court
proceeding sometimes bas its comic
features, and in the midst of yester
day's tedious legal battle the specta
tors suddenly found themselves laugh
ing over the Collins incident In Valk's
testimony and the repartee of coun
sel that it provoked. Heney . had
p.Fked whether the witness ever re
ceived money from any one else for
promoting selections out of their order
and Valk had then told of an agree
ment he made in 1903 with Land Agent
Jeremiah Collins. Collins refused his
first demand of the alleged Benson rate
of 10 cer.uÂ« per acre, but finally agreed
to pay half that rate.
"Collins had many cases pending."
Valk continued," and eome of hia se
lections that I approved out of order
T.ere for as much as 1000 acres. I can
not say how much he owed me. I
was never paid, because when I asked
for money he said he had not agreed
to pay anything until all his selections
had been approved. But I got even
with him by borrowing money from
him and not repaying it."
This method of collecting a debt in
terested McEnerney. and when the Jig
attorney got done laughing he probed
into the transaction. Answering his
questions Valk added the following In
formation:
(X)MEDY IVTERL.UDE.
Another day in the land fraud case
brought out additional testimony in
support of the Government's charge
that bribery of Land Department offi
cials tias resorted to by the defend
ants in order to procure the improper
advancement and approval of illegal
lieu land selections. William E. Valk.
the former principal examiner in the
forest reserve division of the General
Land Office, was on the stand nearly
all day and repeated in greater detail
the story told by him on Tuesday re
icarding the money he claims John A.
Benson raid him for promoting the
Hyde-Benson selections. His testimony
later confirmed t>y D.
Harlan. Valk's former chief in the samp
division of the department, who was
called late in the day and had Just
time before the adjournment to con
fess that bribes had also found their
way into his pocket. A sensational
feature of the hearing was Valk's dec
laration that he grot money from Jere
miah Collins, a land agent at Wash
ington. D. C for advancing selections
in which Collins, was interested. Col
lins' name had not been heard before
during the examination.
When Commissioner Heacock opened
court In the morning McEnerney re
called Valk to the stand and made
him Â£o over every particle of his evi
' dence of the day before. It was a Inns
snd tedious process that brought out
little that was new. The self-confessed
bribe-taker explained the m routine of
Investigating the lieu land selections
and admitted his responsibility for see
ing that they wore in every rospeci
lawful and in form before recommend
ing them to his superi<.-r. the Commis
sioner of the General Land Office, for
approval. Much time was spent in in
effort to get from the witness a state
ment that there was nothing improper

lections ahead nf those filed by other
applicants, bet Valk stuck to his aver
ment that the rules forbade the clerks
In the office to do this, although, upon
a showing by sufficient reason, it might
he done by the Land Commissioner.
APPROVES IIXIXiAI. CLAIMS.
Valk said that many of the defend
ants' selections improperly advanced
by him had later been found to be
defective, seme in the titles to the
lands offered in exchange, some in the
fact that these base lands had been
duplicated in different selections, or for
other reason. Then McEnerney turned
to the alleged money payments, and
? :h* spectators pricked up their ears.
"Did you ever solicit any money from
Becson?"
â¢\>f," the witness answered. "In
the fall of 1902 I wrote him that I was
hard up and as!c?d for payment of the
balance due under his agreement to
jay me 10 cents an acre nri the lands
advanced to approval out of their turn.
I kept no books, but figured that about
<f'00 acres, had gone through in addition
to what he had paid for. so that he
owed me $400. As he had paid me an
amount ranging from 51600 to $2000. the
total acreage Â«'f the selections which
were improperly preferred was prob
ably about 24.000 acres."
At this point Jos^t'h C Carr.pbeM.
I Benson's attorney, who had come in
and taken a seat with his client just
behind McEnerney. suggested that a
copy of Vaik's letter demanding money
might b<? four.d in the record of the I
Benson hearing in New York.
'"Does Mr. Campbell represent Hyde
or Dimond?" asked Government Coun- i
Re! Henry.
"I represent a client who is affected
by the testimony here and whom you
I are attacking in this proceeding. Hence
I shall later ask the privilege of cross
examining some of these Government
matters that concern Ben
eon.*'
, "I shall object to that." Heney said.
"We are not trying Benson here."'
Commissioner Heacock remarked. **anO
I do not think your request will be
proper."
*;V.'ell. we'll argue that question when
Tee come to it." replied Campbell.
Continuing. Valk admitted that Ben
ton had never asked him to approve
cases that were dcfÂ»Â»ctl\ e. and that be
had not agreed to do anything wrong
in return for the money except to for
ward the defendants' selections out of
order. He had given some time out of
office hours to going over these selec
tions and writing out approvals of
them. All his correspondence with the
defendants had been destroyed in the
fall of 1003. but this was not done to
conceal the relations of Hyde and Beu-
Fon with the witness. All this in an
fwer to questions by McEnerney and
Wheeler of counsel for the defense.

THERE is a pretty kettle of fish asimmer ovey in
Colorado, where Â»the State troops have been called
out to, protect the property of the mines at Tellu
ride. It seems that District Judge Theron Stevens has
ordered the arrest of Adjutant General Sherman M. Bell
and Captain Bulkeley Wells, commanding the militia, for
contempt of- court on acount of their failure to deliver
the person of Charles Moyer, president of the Western
Federation of Miners, upon the presentation of a writ of
habeas corpus issued by this selfsame Judge Stevens.
Not only has'he set the arm of the law in motion, but the
Judge has declared that the Governor and all the execu
tive authority of the State of Colorado are in insur
rection against the law. Governor Peabody calmly
maintains that the military will not give up the miners'
president, nor will it pay any heed to the order for t'.ie
arrest of the officers.
This seems to be the hardest snarl of. all the difficul
ties arising out of the struggle between the mine owners
and tllfe striking operatives in the harassed. State of Coif
orado. To the unfortunate circumstance of State troops
having to be called out in order that the business of a
corporation or corporations may be' carried on peace
fully is now added the vastly more regrettable complica
tion of the strife between. Federal judicial authority and
the government of the State. Governor Peabody has
the entire force of the State's troops to back his decision.
Judge Sawyer has recourse to the higher Federal judi
ciary, even to the Supreme Court of the United States if
a bench of final appeal be necessary;-
It is a knotty problem, this one raised by the refusal of
the State authorities to obey a Federal court, and there
must be worked out some delicate problems of the law
before either the Judge or the. Governorvmay be cen
sured. Governor Peabody evidently rests tlie justness of
the arrest of Moyer upon the fifth amendment to the
constitution of the United States, which says that "no
person shall be held to answer for a capital or other
wise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indict
ment of a Grand Jury except in cases arising in the land
or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service
in. time of war or. public danger." Moyer's arrest was,
then, an act of military necessity, according to the lights
of Governor Peabody. By the Federal constitution also,
which provides that "the privilege* of the writ of habeas
corpus shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of
rebellion or invasions, the public safety may require it,"
Colorado's Governor fortifies himself for the refusal to
heed the writ issued, by the Federal Judge. ,
The Federal Judge plainly justifies his issuance of the
writ by his construction of what constitutes a "case of
rebellion." Evidently believing that no rebellion exists
at the present time in. Telluride, he feels that he acts
perfectly within his rights in calling to account those
who refuse to honor a Federal writ of. habeas corpus. If
the cbief executive of the State refuse \to abide by the
order of. the Judge he puts,, himself^in contempt of the
Federal authority and is subject to impeachment. %
This,. then, is the state of affairs in Colorado. Whether
it. will work itself out satisfactorily or, will <- grow into a
situation wherein the United ' States Government will
have to take an active part remains to be decided^by
future events.
THE CLASH IN COLORADO.
There is said to be trouble brewing
between the British War Office and
General Lord Kitchener cuncerning ihÂ«
abolition of the lance as a weapon of
warfare. The Sirdar contends that the
lance Is a very effective weapon when
used against uncivilized troops, and its
continued use in India, where the fight
ing is mainly against savage tribes, is
no doubt advisable.. Lord Kitchener H
talking only for the Indian army, prob
ably, in. contending. for the retention of
the lance, for since the introduction of
the magazine gun in warfare the cav
,alry charge is. a thing of the past.
"Pig-sticking"- is, doubtless, a very ex
hilarating game when played with Â«n
enemy armed with matchlocks or old
breechloaders of obselete pattern, but
the game takes on another aspect when
the man on horseback is ordered to
charge troop3 armed with modern
rapid-fire rifles. It doubtless demoral
izes a savage soldier to be run through
the body with a lance, but the civilized
soldier with a magazine rifle in his
hands will not permit himself to be
run through. The cavalryman presents
too striking a mark that he should b*
permitted to get within -lance preach,
and against well-trained troops he
would not be permitted to get within
spearing distance.
The Lance in Warfare.
. A; dispatch from London says: "It is doubtfcnl whether
the. long expected engagement for the possession of Yalu
River will ever take placeâ certainly not unless the Rus
sians have been heavily reinforced." The only value of
such a dispatch is that it confirms public opinion. ' In
fact, the doubtfulness of any important engagement be
tween the Japs and Russians in the .near future has now
become so great that any occurrence of the kind would
be hailed as a surprise party. â¢
A grocer of the Western Addition a
short time since celebrated the silver
anniversary of his wedding, and to
make the. affair worthy of the occa
sion he had a fine supper prepared
at which he acted as the host. A fine
turkey, done to a turn, was laid be
fore him and as he took up the carver
and fork he turned to the lady guest
seated nearest to hfm, and, desiring
to know if she had any particular

"The winds that waft fame blow
from the east to the west" is a saying
whose truth no one familiar with the
history of American literature will
question, but in the case of James L.

be traveling in an easterly direction,
and already the book has made itself
felt In London, where it Is accepted

Its qualities as ah amusing satire. Al- j
The Scribners announce the Imme
diate publication of a book by the. late
Henry Seton Merriman under the title
of "Tomaso's Fortune and Other Sto
ries." The volume is made up of the
6hort stories â nearly a score of them
â that^ie left at his death, stories said
to possess in an unusual degree the
qualities that have made his novels
acceptable to a multitude of readers.
The themes are varied â from a Span
ish cafe to a field hospital in India or
South Africa, with an admixture of
sea stories of an original character.
The treatment is all dramatic, the ac
tion rapid, the incidents salient, the
figures strongly marked types. Alto
gether the book shows that Mr. Mer
rlman was the master of the art of the
short story as well as the novel. Early
in autumn the same house will publish
â¢'The Last Hope," the novel Mr. Mer
riman completed some time before his
death, and the last one which will ap
jjp.-.r from his pen. Since its comple
tion it has been in the possession of
his publishers and will be put into
book form without appearing first as
a serial.
The novel, which compares in
length and completeness of plot and
historical â¢ , setting with any Mr.
Merriman . has written, has also all
the power and fascination of his most-.
notable and popular stories. I

Surely such a place can be found somewhere around
the bay and can be acquired at a reasonable price. Here
the health of the men is- best assured'and their training
will be but little interrupted by adverse weather. It is
true that there arc theorists who deprecate the forma
tion of such camps, because they imply a training for
war. But the day has not come when a nation can afford
to snub the defensive* arts and when the necessity for
their use appears the theorists have never' been found
read}' to step out from their protection" and stand the
risk alone. It is a practical and not a theoretical matter
and should be treated from the standpoint of military
efficiency and public economy alone.
The first public movement to promote a proper location
has been undertaken by the State Board of Trade, which
has appointed a committee to co-operate with the new
military commission and to ask the assistance of the
other commercial bodies of this city. This is a practi
cal and worthy movement- started none too soon.
It is our right to consult and assist the economical fea
ture v of the selection, which" interests all the taxpayers.
For immovable and unchangeable physical reasons
economy requires that the location be in California. It
should be made at some point where the large transpor
tation of equipment and supplies may be no monopoly,,
but be affected by water and rail competition. It is not
unreasonable to ask that it be also where the largest
number of people may enjoy whatever benefit there is in
it. As the effect of such a location is felt beneficially by
the State and reciprocally by San Francisco this city
cannot be indifferent to it. .
As the State Board vi : Trade has led off in the matter
all of our people should manifest their interest and lend
a hand in the work. Army officers are familiar with our
military posts and are entirely aware of our climatic
conditions. They know the. latter to be favorable above
any other part of the country. The difficult part of their
task is in finding a location of sufficient area for artillery
practice and cavalry drill and rightly placed so as to
economize in transportation and the purchase of sup
plies.
THE better training of our small army requires that
the Government provide the places and the, means
for instruction in artillery gunnery and small arms
marksmanship. This means practically that our land
forces, shall be trained as our sea forces are.
The importance of such training was proved in the
Spanish war. Our men behind the guns on our war ships
had been long drilled in the service and aiming of naval
artillery- The Spanish ships were in tonnage and equip
ment the equal of ours. But the poverty or .indifference
of the Spanish Government had made it consider as
wasteful the use of ammunition in practice. When our
ships engaged the Spanish fleets our shots went home,
while the Spanish gunners h^d not skill enough to hit
the islands they were defending much less the ships in
our fleets.
The land battles of Spain were in the same condi
tion. Indeed some of them had no ammunition at, all.
This furnished the only humorous incident of the brief
war. When Captain Glass sailed up to Guam and took a
crack at the fort the Spanish Governor, who had not
heard of the war, thought it was a salute and put off for
Glass's ship with his staff in full uniform to apologize for
not returning the salute because his Government fur
nished him no powder. He was carried off as a prisoner
of war without a change of shirts. . -0-i '
Our Government, Ih pursuance of its policy of making
our land troops efficient in the actual operations of war,
has provided for the location in different parts of the
country of instruction camps of such ample area as to
accommodate cavalry and infantry drill, furnish space
for artillery practice on a large scale and for training in
rifle shooting. One of these camps is to be located on
this coast and for climatic and other reasons the War De
partment prefers that it be in California. A commission
appointed for the purpose reported two or three sites
in San Luis Obispo County and adjacent territory. ' The
representatives of these rival properties of course antag
onized each other, with the result of holding the selection
in abeyance, and another commission has been appointed
to re-examine the whole subject and make report.
As it is evident that in the Philippines we have on hand
the same kind of a job, with more difficulties, as the sub
jection of "our warlike Indian tribes, there will be upon
us for a long time the necessity of forwarding to and
returning from the islands-a considerable military force
of trained men. The quality of the climate will not per
mit the same force to remain there more' than two years,
so that the change. of men must be going on all the time.
A camp of instruction here will have to be occupied con
tinually by a force of from five to seven thousand men,
and their commissary 2nd maintenance are matters of
importance in which transportation and supplies must be
considered. .

Mr. Howells, whose new serial, "The
Son of Royal Langbrith," is now ap
pearing in the Xorth American Re

reached through the London office of
Harper & Brothers, in Albemarle

been kept busy forwarding his im
portant mail or returning the less
pressing communications with the fol
lowing printed slip: ''Mr. Howells is in
Europe, and during his absence it is
impracticable to reply to your inclosed
communication." His mail includes
poems from aspiring young girls, long
MSS. from people under the mistaken
impression that he is an editor of Har
per's Magazine and who expect one of
the busiest of authors to devote hours
to their critical perusal, and of requests
for assistance of all sorter When Mr.
Howells is home in addition to his reg

It would seem as if G. Bernard Shaw
had at last come into his own. For over
a year there has been almost continu
ous reference to this clever vrlter In
the English papers, and for six months
past he has occupied no little space in
American journals. Some of this au
thor's earliest work, he informs the
public, is entirely out of print and will
never be republlshed. There are a few
of his admirers who have had the cour
age of their convictions, and two of his
choicest early books have been care
fully reprinted in'this country. One of
these, "An . Unsocial Socialist," !s the
only edition at present on the market.
A Xew York house (Brentano's) issued
this volume and "Cashel Byron's Pro
fession" at a time when his following in
America was exceedingly limited, and
their belief in the value of Mr. SHaws
work seems to be warranted. There is
at present general interest in anything
he does, for which this reprinting of
his earlier books is to a great extent
responsible.

Much interest has been aroused
among the readers of Miss Ellen Glas
gow's novel "The Deliverance" as to
the real locality of the story. The au
thor says that the scenes are all laid in
Caroline County, Virginia, which is
near the edge of the dark tobacco grow
ing district. The home of the Blakes
was near the little town- of Baity. The
old mansion from which the Blake
house was drawn still stands, a monu
ment to an aristocratic regime. Ac
cording to the April Bookman "The De

book in the United States. It is the
book most in demand, too, in the twen
ty largest cities.

from Holland, and the ancestry before
this time is traced to Spain. The writ

Mr. Brudno was a . student at Yale,

attracted the attention of W. Robert^

JJarrie and one or two other authors
of lesser note. Mr. Nicoll has been
greatly diverted by Mr. Ford's picture
of Xew York Journalism, and partic

manner in which a fashionable wed

All Christendom is as much interested in the personal
safety of the Pope as are his own churchmen, for his
assassination would at once rekindle prejudices long
gone to ashes. But those who would be affected by such
an event realize their powerlessness to prevent such an
appalling calamity. The consciences of those who would
cause it are quite beyond their reach. It is a species of
atavism that constantly recuns under all forms of gov
ernment''and in spite of the teachings of Christianity.
No schools, no'ethics, no moral or religious teaching has
succeeded in eradicating "it. It is a persistent disease in
civilization, chronic and incurable.
Some dreamers refer it to poverty and Â¦ ascribe that
poverty to the selfishness of those who are not poor.
But this view is not justified, for the preachers of an
archy a re, far from membership in the dependent class in
any of the countries where that cult finds a lurking place.
Nor can it be ascribed to partiality and oppression in
civic institutions, for the evil.spirit is here, where men
are the freest and the most prosperous" in the enjoyment
of more 'equality of opportunity. All that can be done is
to recognize it as a, peculiarly sinister and covert and
merciless form of the criminal s instinct and when we find
it to stamp it out as we do physical contagion.

terms of his contract he is
about to bring suit against the million
aire newspaper owner. His attorney
is John G. Jur>\ himself a poet of no
mean standing.
Mr. Jury was disinclined to talk of
the case last evening, saying: "Mr.
Miller placed the matter in my hands
only this morning and I have hardly
had time to look over the papers. I
believe he has a valid cause of action
against Hearst, who has paid him only
a fraction of his expenses and noth
ing for services. I have no doubt we
shall recover the full amount to be
sued for."
Boxer outbreak "of 1900.
Joaquin Miller, the venerable poet
of the Sierras, came over to San Fran
cisco yesterday from his home among
the Piedmont hills for two purposes â
to meet Thomas Nelson Page, the
celebrated Southern novelist, at^ the
Bohemian Club, and to sue William
Randolph Heamt for $3000 alleged to be
overdue for services rendered to
Hearst's newspapers on a contract as
correspondent in China during the

Fourteen male vagrants in various
stages of sartorial dilapidation were
ranged before his Honor Fritz as the
result of the first " spring rodeo of
"waterfront bums." Patrolman Dow
er, who directed the round-up, told
how he had found the defendants
asleep upon and under wharves, In
empty boxes and buildings, packed
away amid cargo, in coal bunker? â
almost everywhere except, in bed.-
Then the Judge requested that the
old offenders be picked out from the
first-timers, and when the sifting pro
cess had been concluded the debu
tantes were given twenty-four hours
apiece and the 'chronics were sen
tenced to terms of imprisonment
ranging from one to three months.

Dr. Chu Dan Yuen, than whom no
medico in Chinatown enjoys more lu
crative practice, was hastening along,
Jackson street to visit an, opulent pa
tient when he ran afoul of Mike Ze
peda, who addressed him with foul
words and slapped his- face. Arrest
of Mike..
Dr. Yuen informed Judge Cabaniss
that the assault was unprovoked and
the defendant was unable to give rea
8on for iL He did not admire the doc
tor's costume, he said, nor did he en
tirely approve of the way in- which
the voluminous silken skirts were
swung as the doctor walked. It was
the swishing of these garments against
SI ike's leg that impelled him to tell
the doctor what he thought of him
and finally to slap the Celestial's
cheek.
"Ten days," said the Judge.

. Police Captain Dunleavy was walk
ing along Market street when he saw
F. M. Crossley, a . teamster, brutally
beating a horse with the butt-end of
a heavy whip and the veteran officer
placed the man under arrest.
"The horse has the lying-down
habit." said Oossley in defense of his
conduct, "and he was about to squat
â¢*hen I poked him in the ribs with the
whip." .
Judge Fritz fined him $2 50.
â¢ â¢ â¢
When the facts had been explained
to Judge Fritz he dismissed the charge
against Brown and continued the case
of Seaver till to-day. If he had not
been intoxicated, Mr. Seaver says, he
would not have stolen the horse and
buggy and Mr. Brown thinks that Mr.
Seaver owes him at least an apology.
Frank Brown was loitering in a
barroom at Sutter and Devisadero
streets when Frank Seaver, whom he
did not know, entered the place, stated
that Iw had a fast horse attached to
a swell buggy and invited Brown to
take a ride. Acceptance of the invi
tation resulted in the arrest of both
Brown and Seaver for larceny of the
"ris"." it having been taken by Seaver
without its owner's consent.

Mrs. Hattie Johnson made her tare-
S well appearance as a complainant te
i fore Judge Mogan. Her performances
i in that tribunal have been effective,
j Michael, her husband, was given twelve
I months' Imprisonment for ill-treating
! her, and yesterday Mrs. Delia Greehy,
i who assaulted her in the courtroom
j last Saturday, was fined $10" for bat
! tery- Mrs. Johnson has announced in
j tention of transferring herself to Pc-rt
: land. Or.
The Judge allowed the woman to go
. free, and instructed Patrolman Math
j ewson to continue his chase of Alfonso
| until the elusive youth is captured and
charged with vagrancy.
In the court of Judge Mogan there
came finis to the many chaptered ro
mance in which La bra da Morales, aetat
35, and Alfonso Flores, in middle teens,
were the principal characters.
The woman was arrested about six
weeks ago and booked ~ for vagrancy
on complaint of Flores' mere, who de
clared that her son Alfonso had been
virtually abducted by the defendant
and kept away from the maternal roof.
The boy was called to testify, but ne
failed to respond, and then began his
pursuit by Patrolman Mathewson. w ho
appeared in court once a week and re
ported inability to capture. It was
the officer's latest admission of failure
that led to the shelving of the case
yesterday.
When the policeman had reported
progress Labrada addressed the court,
stating that she had decided to plead
guilty and take punishment, because
her heart had undergone a change of
sentiment in the matter of Alfonso.
Dearly as she loved him once, she said,
he does not now possess even the dim
shadow of her affection. Why- Be
cause he intensified her trouble by
blackmailing her after she had been
arrested fer his sake. Instead of sup
porting her with loyalty In her hour
of need he had threatened to appear
in court and corroborate his mother's
testimony if his silence were not pur
chased. She submitted to his extor
tion until her love an' her money were
exhausted. New she cast herself upon
the mercy of the court.
â¢ It was philanthropy that prompted
John Cramer to remove Mrs. Maggie
Ashman from the City and County
Hospital to his home, 435% Tehama
street, and place her in his wife's
care. It was Insatiable craving for
spirituous liquor that led Mrs. Ashman
to treat her benefactors with the basest
ingratitude. She stole from Mrs.
Cramer a diamond ring valued at $50
and a wedding ring intrinsically worth
$7 and pawned them for 75 cents, which
she spent for whisky.
That was the story told to Judge
Conlan, and the accused did not deny
it. She seemed repentant enough, but
it is doubtful -whether she had recov
ered her senses sufficiently to appre
ciate the baseness of her behavior. The
grarnd larceny charge was fully proved,
and the Judge's purpose in continuing
the case till to-morrow was to con
sider how he could best treat the fallen
creature.
Mrs. Ashman was the wife of a well
to-do and respectable citizen, when her
Incurable appetite for drink compelled
him to divorce her. Continued dissipa
tion led to her entering the hospital,
and it was with a hope of reforming
her by guardianship and kind treat
ment that the Cramers took her to
their home.
"It "was the bad booze that I drank."
was the answer, "and I suddenly be
came imbued with a desire to swear
off. Then I hurled the bottle.
. "I'll give you till May 13 to pay for
the signboard," was the court's de
cision.
â¢ "I plead guilfy, your Honor," said
Gorman to Judge Mogan, "and I will
pay for all I broke."
â¢'But why did ypu break anything?"
inquired the Judge.
After he had consumed about a pint
of cheap whisky James Gorman took
careful aim with the bottle that had
contained it and hurled it through
the highly ornamental signboard of a.
Kearny-street saloon.
Thomas Fallon, who shot and killed
his wife in her apartment on Mission
street, was examined before Judge
Conlan and held without ball to an
swer for murder in the Superior Court.
W. L. Ward, who assaulted William
Cluff in a playhouse one night about
two weeks ago,- has been adjudged in
sane . by the Lunacy Commissioners
and yesterday Judge Mogan allowed
him to be taken in custody by rela
tives, who said they will send him to
a sanitarium at Boca.
Â«T' Â¦ * ' â¢
Margaret Ferriter, a widow with
four small children, refused to sell a
drink of whisky to Patrolman J. Mad
den, In plain attire, but she did sell to
him a small flask of the spirit for 15
cents. Then he arrested her for sell
ing liquor without a license in her lit
tle grocery on Xatoma street-'^-
After hearing, the testimony Judge
Mogan dismissed the charge and ad
vised the woman to procure a liquor
license if she desired to sell intoxi
cants. She applied for a permit, she
said, but the number of saloons on the
block now exceeds the legal . maxi
mum. ,_ . . . : .
Three months In the County Jail was
the df)sÂ«> prescribed by Judge Mogan
for William Cox, who - maliciously
hurled a brick through the plate-glass
window of a safe deposit' vault. After
throwing the missile William expressed
regret. that. he had not inflicted $10,000
worth of damage. "You talk like an
anarchist, and as an anarchist you
should be treated," said the Judge.
"Sorry I can't give' you more than
three months."
Mary A. Reardon holds a lease on
the -two-sto'ry frame building num
bered 242 Minna street. She occupies
the second story and the ftxst floor ia
subrented to one Murray, who therein
sells liquors at retail. For some unex
plained reason Mrs. Reardon suddenly
became afflicted with strong aversion
to Murray and r his customers and
showed it in such a demonstrative way
that she was arrested for disturbing
the peace. . .
Mr. Murray was the complaining wit
ress against Mrs. Reardon before
Judge Fritz." and he cited enough ob
jectionable behavior on the pnrt of the
lady to warrant the court in pro
nouncing her guilty and deferring sen
tence till to-day. Among acts men
tioned by Mr. ZÂ»Iurray were that of
maligning his character to mutual ac
quaintances, spilling water upon hi?
patrons as they entered or departed
from the saloon, hurling garbage at the
same targets and addressing them In
language that was not, to say the
least, ladylike. ...;/- .
â¢ Mrs. Reardon did not plead that her
conduct was inspired by abrupt con
version to temperance and correspond
ing abhorrence of the liquor traffic. In
deed she did not plead at all.
Frank Buckley, young and impulsive,

before yesterday he swore to a com
plaint charein- Georce Curran with

sale to substantiate his assertion that
he purchased the machine from: a man
named Goodman in Golden Gate Park,
and then Judge Mogan' discharged him
and roundly; scored the complainant
for his impetuosity. â¢
"It you had gone to the defendant
and told him that the bicycle had been
stolen he would probably have satis
fied you that he was not the thief."

Three Killed by an Explosion.
OKLAHOMA CITY; O.T;, April 13.
News has reached here that {Â¦ three
men were killed by an explosion -of
dynamite at a construction camp
thirty miles southeast 'Â¦ of "Muskogee,
I. T., on the Midland Valley Railroad.

Splendid \yeather and an extremely,
good racing card attracted a ; large at-^
tendance. v Some' excellent sport re
sulted, Avith ' first choices holding their
own by capturing three events. â¢ '
Â» Billy, CahlU'8 big brown horse ' Sweet
Tooth wiped' up. the; floor .with the col
lection lining up in; the opening sprint.
He was played down to 6 to 5 and with
"Big Bill" Knapp up won airthe way.
Solinus.^at 10 to 1, downed Nellie Bawn
forthe place. ;^ " f .
; Peggy 'O'Neil from Bob Smith's sta
blegave the hot foot to>a smart, bunch
of youngsters in the kindergarten
"event at , half 'a mile." * The -T Mist Â¥ en
joyed first call-in -the betting, , but was
slow "in leaving- the v barrier, and
Knapp had ; to take' the overland route
Tan unplaced.; Larsen, on Peggy
O'Neil, :' slipped', away -.in Tithe; lead; and
at the end; downed George P. McNear
cleverly. ,.; Albert finished u* third.
Arisbe failed to: show her" bÂ«st form,
at no time looking dangerous. ; v;
COL. ANDERSON FANCIED.
By this time R. -Wilson had Byron
Rose in the lead and in a driving fin
ish earned a nose verdict over. Joe
Jones on Gorgalette, another 25 ;to 1
shot. Our. Bessie, at the.. soothing price
of* 10 to,. 1, , dropped in third. / Bonner
fell so far out of the running that the
colored boy must have thought he was
driving a delivery wagon. His exhibi
tion was such: a ; thrilling one '-' and
fraught -.with so ; much danger that the
judges \ decided j to suspend - him. Bon
ner's;riding-hasibeen the cause for
much comment of date, and the action
of the -officials -has been expected for
some; days. V : : ; ,â¢'-;â¢.".â¢'.'Â¦. ;Â¦' 'Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦"Â¦Â¦Â¦: '
..For possibly three-quarters of a
mile Mansard*, piloted by Otis, cut out
the pace. He must have struqk a float
ing mine then, for; he blew up and
Â¦with a frightful roar and gurgle dropr
ped back to the rear.
BYRON' ROSE LEADS. *
The price about the winner was not
lengthy either. If it had been any
longer it would have looked too much
like a bargain,and nobody would have
made a purchase/There was some 50
and of course there was the one keen
eyed individual who saw 75, but the
most likely price seemed to be 25 and
30. All the" curbstone brokers picked
up the IV to 5 against Mansard until
8 to 5 was the ruling quotation. There
was seemingly no demand for Ben
MacDhui, ,the odds floating back from
8 to 5 to ."4< and 5.
Shades of Petaluma and Whiskers!
Byron Rose from the same up-country
town, planted his nose a head in front
of Gorgalette for the "mile and fifty
yards handicap yesterday at Oakland
track.

tary Man ran a fair third. There was
some 12 to 1 about the winner, which
was gobbled up by. members of the
Cherry Pickers' Union. * . .
Illilouon looked the surest bet of the
day and Billy Randall's* gelding took
the concluding mile selling run quite
easily. H?s odds were pounded down
from 2 to 1 -to 6 to 5 and with Jed

MASTIFFS
A constant stream of visitors flowed
Jnto the pavilion durinpr the afternoon.
In the evening there was a fashionable
crush, many of the daintily gowned
ladies having their pets among the
dogs benched. The complete list of
awards made yesterday follows:
The tny dogrs proved a magnet to
draw the ladies and children to the
south side of the pavilion. One of the
terriers occupied a kennel the walls of
which were covered with yellow satin.
The kennel was illuminated with elec
tric lights, and at a distance loomed up
like a lighthouse. The ouarters of
others were bcribboned and beflowered
as the artistic taste of the owners dic
tated.
In pointers E. Courtney Ford's Bos
ton, which won at Chicago last year. J
beat Rap Rattler. The latter was
placed first among pointers by Judge
Roper at the last show.
. The battle of the St. Bernards be
tween Le King and Lester C was re
sumed yesterday, the latter winning.
Judge Cole placed Le King first in last
vinter's show, to the surprise of the
experts.
The most Interesting part of the
judging will take place this afternoon,
Â¦when the grand collection of bull ter
riere and fox terriers will parade be
fore Judge Mortimer. Of the fox ter
riers Charles K. Harley has a formid
able string of imported dogs and of
dogs bred by himself, which have been
winning on the Eastern circuit and in
England. His string was one of the
.sensations of the show last night, each
<iosr being clothed in an artistic blanket.
The Boston terriers are strong, both j
in numbers and in quality. W. H.
Iteming is showing a white terrier, the
only one on the coast. !
The man or the woman who loves a .
<Jog: cannot afford to miss the annual
exhibition of the San Francisco Ken
rel Club, which was thrown open to
the public yesterday at Mechanics* Pa- j
vilion. The show is remarkably rich i
in Quality, and all the breeds from the {
huge SL Bernard to the tiniest of toy
terriers are well represented.
Judge Mortimer is kind enough to
Ray that there are dogs benched in the
Pavilion which would win in any show
ing in the world. The English setters.
the aristocrats of the kennels, are
a particularly strong class, and are
pronounced the best ever seen here.
Cato Jr.. which won last year, won
ajsrain yesterday, thus earning the
title of champion. "Dad" Moulton's I
Palo Alto carried off the honors in the j
puppy class, Mrs. Moulton's Pope be- j
ing placed second. Judge Mortimer j
predicts that Palo Alto will develop Â¦
into a good dog during .the next year.

Schock did nothing but treat bats
men to bases on balls and when he
had succeeded in filling up the bases
some one generally, clouted the leather
out to the flagpole and then the whole
bunch would trot in. This sort, of thing
wenCon for seven innings, though the
fans fairly begged Parke Wilson to
take his ponderous 'joke- but of the
box and put in some one who could and
would put a ball over the plate. Finally
young Mr. Hair was trotted out. He
proved so nervous and so rattled that
he passed four in a row and allowed
a two-bagger.
Seattle hit .Moskiman *all over the
lot. but the best they grot was six runs.
They ran bases like a bunch of hay
balers. In the seventh round five of
them fell on the offerings of the med
ical man and yet only two runs
showed. All the way through it was
something like that and though the
fans were for the northerners to a
man, the latter refused to be encour
aged to victory.
When the players could not delay
the game in any other way they gen
erally started at Umpire Cramer anii
roasted him for fair, although he um
pired an excellent quality of ball. The
wholo show was, awful and the kind
that' keeps people away from the bail
park. By winning. , Oakland Jumped
into the lead and If everything goes
right they will remain there for: some
time. The score: x
Oakland â f Seattle â
'Twas a Schocklng exhibition/that
baseball game that was decided yes
terday at Recreation Park. So shock
ing -was Mr. Schock that he shocked
everything with, which he came in con
tact. He shocked the game away be
fore it was many minutes long,' but
anyhow, it dragged along and broke a
record, ending after two wears hours
and thirty weary minutes. Score: Oak
land, 11; Seattle, 6..
If Mr. Schock ever attempts to pitch
ball here again there will be a rough
house. When he loomed up on that
mound yesterday as big as a house
and commenced to throw 'em up to
the plate the fans were on to him and
they were not slow in 'inviting him to
take to the bushy districts. But â¢ he
stayedâ stayed so long that the game
became n tragedy instead of a comedy.
He gave the worst -exhibition of any
pitcher who ever toed the ; mountain
at Recreation Park. He shocked thn
fans so badly that most of them made
their getaways early. .He shocked his
team mates to such an extent that
they were unable to stop a 'ball if it
happened to be hit. He shocked Um
pire Dave Cramer till the latter forgot
to call strikes when thoy came over
the plate. . . . .

Both Fides an? determined to hold
their pround. and, if necessary, shut
down the hack business permanently
in this city.
Ab the result of a derision reached
by the Stable and Ca.rriape Owners"
Association late last night, in which
they m refuse to meet any of the de
mands of the Hacfcmen's Union, no
hacks or cabs will- be seen on the
streets of this city to-day, and trans
portation by hacks and cabs will be
abandoned until the parties come to a
MtUexaent. The demands of the union
are that the drivers receive greater
wages and get shorter hours, also that
ih<* union be recognized.
The union met several nights ago,
and since then the employers have
anxiously awaited the result/ They had
an intimation that there would be some
demand.*, but were not advised of them
until last night. A special meeting was
immediately called by the Stable and
<'arriagp Owners' Association and it
was decided that none of the demands
be allowed, and that rather than make
nny move toward a reconciliation they

Proof of the fact that the stable ovÂ»'n
are are determined to carry out their de
cision was evinced when the United
Carriage Company turned over seventy
bones to pasture. Other hack owners
say they will pasture their horses.
Undertakers have already realized
the blow that the coming strike will be
to -their business, and they are con
tracting for automobiles.
The Hostlers' Union has notified the

business with the aid of non-union help

cries attracted a crowd. Nolan darted
down Mason street, -but a number of
people were in his wake calling "Stop
thief!" and the attention of Patrolman
Hayden was attracted. ;â¢;- The officer
started in pursuit and soon overtook
the fugitive. The latter gave him bat
tle and -it was some minutes before
the' policeman succeeded. in placing. the
handcuffs on his man. Nolan was
taken to the residence of Mrs. Hughes,
where he was identified as the man
who committed the robbery earlier in
the evening. At the Central police sta
tion his name was registered on the
detinue boc-k and- to-day he will be
taken before the detectives and an ef
fort will- be made to. learn his identity
and his record if he has any.
A daring and brutar- highwayman
held up and assaulted two women in
the downtown section of the city early
last evening. From one of his victims
he secured a mite of mc-ney she car
ried in her purse, but he was fright
ened away from the other by her out
cries. A crowd started in pursuit and
Patrolman Hayden made the capture,
after, a severe struggle. -The crime is
pronounced by the police one. -of the
moat daring on record for some time.
At the Central police static-n the man
gave the name William Nolan. He said
he was a teamster and resided at 1210
Mission street. It was not later than
9 o'clock when he held up Mrs. Hughes
of 15 Powell street as . the lady was
walking at the corner of Taylor and
O'Farrell streets. Though there were
hundreds of people within the radius
of one block, the bold thief seized. his
victim and threw her to the sidewalk.
He placed one hand over her^ mouth
and beat her severely with the other.
When the woman was in a condition to
sound no alarm he tore her purse from
her clutch and started up O'Farrell
street. The affair occurred so quickly
that few pec-ple realized what had hap
pened. As quickly as iirs. Hughes
could recover from the shock she told
of the robbery, and the few men who
started in pursuit of the thief found
that he had made good his escape.
The occurrence created a great deal of
commotion in the vicinity, and the po
lice after having gained a description
of the vicious robber commenced a
hunt for him. '
Â¦It was nearly "an hour later, how
ever, before Nolan was heard from
again. Mrs. W. Reinshagen, who re
sides at 460 Geary street, was walking
up the; steps of her home when Nolan
hastily ascended behind her, seized her
by. the throat and attempted to choke
her. In vain the woman tried to scream,
but the grasp the ? thief had on her
throat was too strong. She carried
her keys in her hand j and these she
cast to the pavement below Â¦. to attract
attention. When Nolan saw this move
ment he released his grip and without
waiting to secure any valuables or
money started to run away. â¢

DEUGIITFUIi TRIP PROMISED.
This great body of over a quarter
of a million acres of land lies in thÂ»
north gateway of the San Joaquin Val
ley, but 130 miles from San Francisco.
The significance to San Francisco of
its development cannot be overesti
mated- In 1903 the grain crop of this
State produced on 3.000,000 acres of
land gave returns of $22,000,000; in the
same year the returns from 300 000
acres of irrigated land in this State
reached $30,000,000. Let the grain crop
rmspects of this State appear discour
aging and the effect is readily reflect
ed in the business and financial circles
of San Francisco. The future develop
ment cf the single body of land under
our canals trill in the course of time
give never-failing revenue in excess of
that of the normal grain crop of the
State.
PROSPECTS ARE BRIGHT.
A special interest attaches to the
coming jubilee, which will celebrate
the completion of the Modesto and
Turlock irrigation systems. These are
virtually one system, and constitute
the greatest irrigation works in Amer
ica. Not only is this so. but thts
preat system was constructed and is
owned and successfully operated by
the people resident of the 250.000 acres
of land embraced by the canals. The
little city of Modesto, the county seat
of Stanislaus, is the center of this
splendid area. The canals agrgresate
about 250 miles, and the mains are
.4 and 64 feet wide on the bottom and
designed to carry a depth of eight and
six feet of water, respectively.
The Tuolumne River, with a* water
shed second only to that of one other
stream in the State, furnishes an abun
dant supply of water for these artificial
rivers, as the canals may be termed.
The cost of the works has been $2 500 -
000. Already 30.000 acres of land which
has made Stanislaus first in wheat pro
duction has beÂ«n withdrawn from that
industry and planted to alfalfa
peaches. almonds. olives, apricots'.
Calimyrna, ftps, oranges, vines and field
products with gratifying success. Next
season will &ee 50,000 acres under such
cultivation and in less than five years
100.000 acres will be devoted to this
diversified industry. Over 3000 people
have settled on these lands In the last
two years. Wheat ranches from 320
to 1000 acres are now the homes of
from 10 to over 100 families each;, in
instances over 1000 people have been
placed in one colonv.
The rates from San Francisco to the
jubilee and return will be $3 10, the
journey one way occupying four hours.
Sleepers wii: be available for the jour
ney. The charge for Pullman accom
modations is $2 23 for two days and
one night. Visitors may leave either
Friday afternoon or Saturday morn
ing, returning Saturday or Sunday. All
those desiring to attend the excursion
are requested to call at the headquar
ters of the committee. 25 New Mont
gomery street, and make reservations.

423 Eddy st.
I PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Fiammarlon's treatises that
is so electrifying the world to-day. HE IS
NO IMITATOR. His work Is upon original
lines; PURE THOUGHT. CLEAR VISION.
He "TELLS YOU WHAT YOU DESIRE TO
KNOW, AND WORKS IN THE OPEN
LIGHT." AND IS AS. CONSPICUOUS FOR
ITS WONDERFUL OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR ITS ORIGINAL EXPRESSION
AND VIVID TRUTHFULNESS.
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test is
of little value when the. mind is troubledâ
you need more â¢ substantial aid and advice.
' This - Is Just what PROF, f LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call 0$ him for. a flrst-
class clairvoyant reading. ' (He asks you no
questions, but tells you what you wish to
know. Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦,'Â¦Â¦
- He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in >. your case. Let PROF. â¢
LIVINGSTONE analyze the -matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedv. ' Â¦ " '-Â¦Â¦:

This invention has for its object the production of a novel lamp, particularly desirable for it>e as a
night lamp. Lamps for this purpose need not produce a large flame: in fact, a comparatively small flame is
more desirable, but it is also desirable that the lamp be capable of burning for a long period without. refilling
and without attention and without emitting any odor. These results are positively .obtained. Directions

President Cornelius and Secretary
Bowling of the. Carmen's Union "re
sumed their conference with President
Holland and General Manager Chap
man of the United Railroads yesterday
afternoon, but at the end of their talk
the representatives of both sides an
nounced that they were not ready to
make statements. It /was learned
that the officials of the railroad com
pany have so far refused to give the
slightest encouragement to the carmen
for an advance in wages under any
conditions other than those proposed
in the communication sent to the em
ployes by the company last week in
response to the formal demand by the
men for. a new wage scale. The car~
men no longer deny that they., expect
a strike. They say that the only men
opposed to a strike are those receiving
27% cents an hour, and it is declared
that such are in the minority.
YV\ D. Mahon of Detroit, president
of the Amalgamated Association of
Street and Electric Railway Employes
of America, arrived in this city last
evening and is registered at the Grand
Hotel. Shortly, after his arrival he
visited the carmen's headauarters on
Market street and discussed the local
situation with President Cornelius,
Secretary Bowling and other members
of the executive committee of the
union. Asked regarding his visit to
San Francisco President Mahon said:
"Officially I ani taking no part in
the present contentions between the
carmen and their employers, for as
yet they are purely of a local charac
ter and do not warrant any action on
my part. Of course, as an executive
officer of the national body of carmen,
I will be bound to assist the local or
ganization in case a breach occurs be
tween the men and the company, but
this has not yet happened. As a fact
I have not had time to acquaint myself
with the conditions here, but will lose
no time in" doing so."
President Mahon says he will re
main here for some time, which means
that he will stay until the agreement
between the union and the company
expires on June 30, and until it is de
termined what the company does re
garding the demands of its employes.

OF A HDMAX SKETjETOX
Bom's Discovered in Street of "Xapa
Are Probably Tliose of,
? an Indian.
NAPA, April 13.^William Robert
son made a grewsome find to-day.
While working away with pick and
shovel in a deep cut on the Grant
avenue side of Oak Mound he found
the bones of a human skeleton.
All the bones showed indications of
having: been in the ground a long time,
being badly decayed, with the excep
tion of the teeth, which were sound.
The frame was that" of a full grown
man and the bones are probably those
of an Indian. Last Saturday a body
was found near the same spot/ It was
much smaller and was thought to be
of a woman or youth. Like the one
discovered Friday, it was badly de
composed.

Harrison's. circular says: "Since the steam
ship Sonoma left this port there has been no
cargo cf Australian Coal delivered here." This
Is very exceptional, now nearly one month since
the last ship f rosn ; Newcastle arrived. There
are four. vessels now en route to this port which
are fully due; several new names have been
added this week- to > the chartered list' of 'coal
carriers, which now figures up In all thirty-one
vessels, with a carrying capacity of about 80.000
tons. ' Some Â¦ of these vessels . will not load
before July or ? August next. The Australian
Coal now her* In yÂ»rd amounts to very little
and is almost entirely held by . one wholesale
dealer, hence price* are well , sustained. As
spring weather has put In an appearance,- the
sales of household coals will materially dimin
ish. 1 " Freight rates, on Coal from Newcastle are
reported - much * firmer, â¢ caused , presumably by
the freight rates on grain to Europe from colo
nial ports. There is but -little demand here
for all grades of. foreign fuel,, which are only
suitable. for steam" purposes, as the prices de
manded here : for British Columbia and Wash
ington : steam Â¦ Coals \ makes If impossible Â¦ for

firms who own the bulk of the available sup
plies, and as there is very little competition
between dealers prices , are easily maintained
and the ' :nr.rket cleans up well from day to
day. Small sales : of river Burbanks were re
ported yesterday- at $1 55 per cental. Yellow
Onions were quoted steady at unchanged rates,
while green were In better demand and higher.

A standard New York authority thus Ftates
the current conditions In trade: "AÂ« a result
of i^cent stock market advances a much better
Idling exists in financial circles, notwith
.-â¢ai; !i:.c many unsatisfactory features. It Is
<juit*; evident that the country i* going through
a reriod of business reaction, which began in
th> East and it tlowly traveling westward.
Its grtaUft severity seems to have been felt
â¢ in this side of the Mississippi, and there are
Â«!rcady .-.-Â¦:.- of recovery which are more or
l'-ss encouraging. 'At^the West depression has
bwn much less severe, hut se^ms .destined to
run tit courst until it disappears on the Pa-
GiBc foast. Both railroad earnings and clear
ing house returnt. as well as business reports,
testify to this ivartion, and the great wonder
is that it has not been more severe, consider
ing the upheavals that have taken place In
'he financial and in the labor markets. The
latter arc fortunately abating, and the quick
r. sumption of revival tendencies Is satisfactory
j roof of the soundness of business affairs in
Mntral. The cost of living is very high and
e good many men are thrown out of employ
ment l>y labor troubles or other difficulties:
but the rÂ«-aCJustment 1 rocess is fairly under
way, and Is likely to continue until the basis
of a new forward movement is laid. The

recover its former holdings of Northern Pa
cific. But the action of the stock yesterday
on that supposition caused a deeply grounded
impret*-lon that the recent mysterious accumu
lation of Union Pacific Is based on the hope of
Â¦ advantage to the stock from the ends sought
in the fult. The speculative basis thus im
plied for the recent movement in Union Pa
cific and the problematical outcome of the
factors in the speculation caused misgivings.
The uncertainty thus caused ard reflected in
the hesitating fluctuations in Union Pacific un
eettJed the whole market. To add to the hesi
tation reiiorts were circulated of the I forma
tion or a formidable i>arty for a bear cam
paign which had been selling Us holdings and
putting out fhert line* at the high level In
I preparation for an onslaught upon values. The
effect of th?*e rei>orts was to intimidate trad
er* from attempting to advance prices or from
buying stock?. The influence- of foreign mar
kets wan also on the Fide of reaction, and there
were ferrs that the Russian naval disaster
might result In further depression in the Paris
market. The cancellation of- an option of
C7.000 tor.s of plglron by the United States
Su-el Â»*orporation and the reason given, that It
vas fiared thai the purchase would Invite the
resumption of blast furnaces, was not of re
aK!<uring Â«-ffect on sentiment regarding the
ir<m and Eteel trade. Renewed strength In the
wheat market pointed to yesterday's weak
ness as due to profit taking on the Government
report, wtth the ultimate effect still to be
counted with. On the other hand reports
were current of a large export of steel prod
ucts for March, and the very cheerful view
of the trade outlook expressed by the Iron Age
and published near the close, had an important
Influence in rallying the market. The closing
was firm.

NEW YORK, April in.â The dull and un
certain stock rr.?.rket of to-day was the natural
outcome ot the course of the previous market.
The rather violent break In Union Pacific with
which the market closed yesterday was re
garded to-day as due to a raid. A more care
ful consideration of the part taken by the At
torney Oeneral in the Northern t>ruriUe* pro
cecding* at i=t. Paul modified the first impres
sion that the Government was opposing â¢ Itself
en principle to the Union Pacific's effort to

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
FORECAST. V. Â»: Â¦
"We have had a good trading market and
priors seem destined for a higher level: stili.
tuyers must now exercise greater prudence, ar
the advance renders reactions more probable."
Henry Clews pa>s In his New York circular:
*"Th* unusual *-asp of the money market i*
portly Out to lessened business* requirements.
Â«Â»ur April usually a period of dis
turbance, were jiassrd without a flurry. An
othrr rvason for present Â«aÂ«e is the great and
Â«ontinun1 expansion of our currency. Usually
f-uch conditions stimulate Â« xce^Five speculation;
hut public lomjwT ar.d the public pocketbook
Â¦ re in no condition for extremes of this sort.
Uoth Investors and yprculutors are in an fl
â¢ Â¦Â»tdinc!y conservative- frame of mind, and this
I* a eafefruard for the future. Gold exports
liave commenced, and ceem likely to continue
lor a r^riod. This is the reason for such
movement*, and. in view of our large surplus
rrffn'fti, they are not likely to cause any con
â¢Â¦â¢â¢rn. Our exports have been Interrupted by
the recent tjx-culation in cotton and wheat:
t it s* these influences have been broken, and
as our imports are declining under dimlnishcil
trad* activity here, the chances are not in
favor of any extensive outflow under rrc>ent
condition*. London has shown more disposi
tion to invest in Americans lately, and this is
a favorable element. The international move
ments, however, will probably be largely in
fluenced by the war. Very soon Fome decisive
*npÂ«gemtnts are likely to take place and hos
tilities will l>e more actively pushed. . Japan
b likely to soon place a loan, and will prob
ably raise fund* in this way more easily th-an
Russia, which ha* already drained France of
Â«;i Khc is willing- to part with. A decisive
.laparu-se victory would probably be promptly
followed by a Japanese loan, while the effect
u;.on Russian credit would be severe, especially
in Trance, where the loana to holders of Rup-
F:an l>ord> would not strengthen the Franco-
Ku^sian alliance. Should Rugsia score the n'i>'t
importcnt victory the results mljrht be exactly
the reverse of the above, but hardly In the
tafflf degree.

Bran and Middlings continue firm at the ad

Hay continues more or less easy, though - the
leading holders are not pressing' the market to
Bell. Â¦.-Â« â¢Â¦..Â¦.Â¦.-Â¦.Â¦ â¢ ' - . " .Â¦ Â¦_-..â¢
The circular Â¦ of Somers & Co. says:
"The surprisingly large quantity of 3300 tons
of Hay has arrived during the week ending
to-day, an increase of 500 tons over the week
preceding. It is several months since we have
had any such . arrivals , as this. It is an un
deniable fact that the country cannot stand a
continuance . of such heavy drains very long
and we are* of the decided opinion â¢ that from
this time on shipments will be much lighter.
Some sample . shipments have been made from
â¢outside' districts, but the style of bale and
quality of Hay^gent has not been very satis
factory to this market, with the result that
shippers have been considerably disappointed
and are now seeking other markets for their
Hay. Both in the extreme northern. and the"
extreme southern parts of the State, as well
as very generally throughout .the San Joaquln
Valley, the three-wire bale Is used almost, ex- ]
cluslvely. - This does â¢ not take well here, ' the
three-quarter bale with five bands selling best
on the San Francisco . market. -Quite a bit of
what Is being shipped trom the above-mention
ed outside districts is in this three-wire bale,
and at. least ?1 wr ton is lost as a result of
marketing the Hay in what is here considered
an undesirable package.
"In spite of the large amount of rain which
we had last month, conditions are now rapidly
changing owing to continuous hot weather. The
top of the ground. is becoming baked aftd we
must have more showers soon to Insure the
splendid crop which was promised a few weeks
ago. . Â¦ â¢
"As to the immediate future of the market,
everything will depend on receipts. On Friday
next the Government will receive bids for about
*J5(X> tona of Hay, and It is expected that this
will have quite an effect on the market here, it
being generally believed that San Francisco
will receive the order."'

Laura and â¢ Bronislava. They are very
funny as the shabby genteel . family,
with their' jewels' and one "mouchoir"
between them. There is, when one
comes to -think of itâ the -"mouchoir".
reminds 1 â a serious objection to labeling
"The; Beggar Student" with DeKo
ven's or any other of the modern
names. Jt is* too funny. To return,
the Roma and Tannehill both bring a
lively sense of humor to the exposition
of their roles, and the music is. effec
tively exploited. Milloecker does not
excuse Â¦ his "character" Â¦ woman from
singing duty, and the. Laui'a is almost
as exacting as a Lucia., It is a little
over-lyrical for the Roma voice.
Miss de Filippe is the enfant terrible,
Bronislava; and is almost too ; much
"enfant." She is a sprightly little soul,
a dainty little figure in her Polish furs
and sinsrs- charmingly, and when she
has gained something Â»pf repose will
be even more effective than she now is.
She has \ her audience already, ; though.'
. Ferris Hartman is the general In . his
usual funny wise,' with some good and
medium gags and a rather 111-fltting
martial chest. Webb is comical as the
jailer, and Algernon Aspland, William
Schuster, Fogarty, Formes, Perron,
Miss King and' Miss Deglow are reck
lessly'flung over .the rest of the cast.
The 1 chorus should- be. mentioned. It
got several hands for itself alone.* -
Altogether,- you will . distinctly â¢ miss
it If you do not hear "The v Beggar. Stu
dent." . . BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Russo's mercurial genius is-expended
on the part of Symon, the beggar stu
dent, who -to. free himself from prison
consents to impersonate a prince. His
other duties . are to , woo and \ wed a
haughty countess, who , has rejected - the
general who bribes Symon. ' Russo glit
ters in Â¦ the part. His tenor spreads
like cream over the . songs - and he
brings . a buoyancy, an earnestness, a
frolicsome â¢ lightness > to the role that
give . one quite Its best. His partner
in sin, Mr. Brownlow, who is Jan, who
apes the . prince's se5retary. is almost
equally well suited. In particularly
good form ig Mr. Brownlow's barytone,
that is especially enjoyable in the
pretty duet with Bronislava in the sec
ond act. . . . â¢
The conditions would have dampened
anything but , a Tivoli cast In a Mil
loecker opera. But the combination is
impregnable. The singers and Ferris
Hartman sparkled, lilted and laughed
through a performance that is one of
the best in their record. If you want
fun,:. plenty of It, a good story and
some rattling, good singing, go to see it
for yourself. ,
Piece and production alike are ex
cellent. It takes singing does "The
Beggar Student," and they sing it at
the Tivoliâ Russo, Roma, De Filippe,
Brownlow, Cunningham â and what a
pleasant, unforced note Bessie Tanne
hill's is! They act it well, too, and
the opera is staged and costumed
charmingly.
Tack on the De Koven label and
advertise "The Beggar Student" as the
latest New York success, and the Tivoli
would be crowded this week. It would
be more crowded next, as every auditor
would become its press agent. Unfor
tunately the crowd seems to be any
where else this week. Even the enthu
siast . could hardly, dub the house a
"fair" one last night. There were rows
on rows of empty seats echoing to
Roma's mellow note and Russo's love
ly lingo.

It is planned. to enforce the rule when j
applications are first made for taking >
teachers' - examinations, one of which '
will be held*- in /June, j Heretofore ap- I
plications have came from teachers in i
remote . places ; in ..the State. Some of
the successful ones have been elected
by formal resolution, but a number of;
them would ask for an extension of
time before assuming the positions, and
this caused much inconvenience ta.the
Scnool Board.: The new rule would ;
o"bvir.te the inconvenience, as selections .
would in future be made from bona fide
residents of this city.
The rules governing the Oakland and
Alameda schools provide that teachers
employed there must be actual resi- !
dents. The rules go even further and â¢
impose- fees on, all non-resident pupils
who attend the schools. The fee for
the primary schools is $10 per term;
for grammar schools, $15 per term, and
for high schools, $20 per term. The
local board does notintend at present
to adopt a rule, militating against non
resident, pupils, although President-
Roncovieri expressed an opinion that
it is a good rule. There are few.non- i
resident ..pupils attending schools of
this city.' Â¦ . â¢ /
' The, Board! of Education's intention J
to incorporate in the revised rules one
prohibiting teachers^ in 'the local school
department' from residing in outside
towns caused -consternation among the
forty teachers who do not reside in I
this city and who Would be affected
by the new regulation.
The telephone lines leading into the
office of the -Board of Education were
kept busy . yesterday by the teachers
who desired to know, whether the board
would riot â¢ recede from its position.
They were j informed that the board is
of the opinion that the rule is a good j
one and would be incorporated in the |
regulations, but 'that a proviso might i
be inserted- exempting the teachers at
present in the department who live in
suburban towns from its provisions.
March 7 he again phoned and we went over
to gee him. He asked how much was coming
to him, and on learning the amount said
that he would first consult his attorneys. We
told "him that it was immaterial to us whether
he accepted the money. We did not believe
that Soeder was entitled to any money from
the policies he took out on Blaise's life, so
thought H best to return the amounts paid.
We felt that in view of the fact that Soeder
lied as to his business and his brother-in
law's occupation, as well as in other particu
lars during the making out of the applica
tions, that we were safe as far as being held
for the payment of the policies was con
cerned. Soeder also changed or caused to bo
changed the name of Blaise's wife on one
of the policies and had his own name inserted
In Us place. This was done without the
knowledge of the home office at the time.. .-
On the morning of April fi we again heard
from Soeder. We went to the Jail and paid
him the $107 60 and he signed over the poli T
cles to us. The policies are still in the keep
ing of the Dollee and I do not know whether
we can now be held liable for themâ that Js
a legal question to be decided by the courts.
Included In the $107 Â»iO was $5 which was
paid on the premium of the policy fhken out
on Bender's life. That policy is now void.
Soeder failed to make the last payment when
it was due; so we are no longer responsible
to him lor any policy on his life.
Of course we know that Blaise paid some
of the money on one of the policies himself,
but have good cause to believe. In the light
of thÂ« police findings, that the money was
riven to him by Soeder.
POLICE ACCUMULATE EVIDENCE
' The police are elated at the accu
mulation of evidence against Soeder
and are confident that they will T con
vict him when the case comes up for
trial April 18. They argue that his
acceptance of the money from the in
surance pe6ple is as good as an admis
sion that the life insurance policies
were obtained illegally and *by mis
representation.
Attorney Salomon. Soeder s attor
ney, denied any knowledge of Soeder's
acceptance of the premium money
from the Mutual Life Company. De
tective Gibson believes that Soeder
realized that he would be convicted
and "double crossed" his lawyer by
getting hold of the $107 60.
The police have a valuable piece of
evidence in the Blaise murder case,
which, they claim, is a practical ad
mission on the part of Soeder that he
is gruilty of the murder of his brother
in-law, Joseph Blaise. Detective
Gibson has been informed by the of
ficials of the Pacific Mutual Life In
surance Company that Soeder had ac-.
cepted from them every cent of money
that he or Blaise paid on the policies
issued in their company. The deal
which the insurance people have been
trying to put through with the ac
cused rmurderer was consummated on
April 6.
Shortly after Soeder was charged
with murder the insurance people in
whose company the prisoner held
policies attempted to get him to take
back the money that he had paid
them. Soeder. then confident of his
ultimate acauittal, scorned the offer.
Soon afUr the close of the prelimin
ary hearing, at which the police piled
up sufficient evidence to have Soeder
bound over to the Superior Court for
trial before a Jury, the accused man
began overtures to regain the money
once refused.
Attorney Roscoe S. Gray of the law
firm of Fox & Gray, attorneys for
the Mutual Life, stated yesterday
that Soeder had been 'paid $107 60,
every cent that he paid the company.
He said: "On March 3 Soeder phoned
from Jthe Broadway Jail for some
member of the company to come and
see him. We sent a representative to
him with the money. Soeder wanted
to knowif the previous offer that we
had made him still held good. He
was informed that it did. Then he
told the representative of the company
that he would think it over."

HUSBAND IN .7 AID.
Clarke was followed by Charles Ma
loon and D. J. Denahy, watchmen on
duty at the Oakland City Hall the
night of the marriage. They both tes
tified that Clarke was verv, drunk the
night he came there with a woman and
a friend to get a license, and. acted as
if he imagined the proceeding was a
Joke. The next witness was C. H.
Shaw, the hackman who took Clarke
and the woman, from the Webber
House in Oakland to the City Hall,
and from there to the home of Wil
liam Van de Mark, the minister who
performed the ceremony. He said that
Clarke was so drfink that Miss Bower
and her companion had to walk on
each side of him and help him along.
The trial closed with the testimony of
Captain C. G. Lyman and Clarke's
brother-in-law and A. J. Rich. They
testified that they started a still, hunt
for Clarke when they heard of his
marriage an.d found him at the Lick
House, considerably undeF the influ
ence of liquor and very sick. They
took him from the hostelry to Dr.
Terrill and placed him under treat
ment.
.WATCHMEN TESTIFY.
The "Sweet Pea Girl" is once more a
spinster. Judge Seawell found yester
day that: Edward K. Clarke, the cap
italist, was drunk and incapable of
knowing what he was doing when,
after a prolonged debauch, 1 he went to
Oakland and. made her his wife. The
Judge accordingly granted Clarke's pe
tition for a decree annulling thermar
riage. ; Mrs. Clarke, or as she is to
be known, Rosalind Bower, did not ap
pear to contest the suit, which gave
rise to the rumor that some of the
capitalist's money had found its way
to the purse of the young lady, and
caused her to reconsider her intention
to fight Clarke's suit. A settlement
of some sort was , made, but the at
torneys in the case will not make the
terms public.
Clarke was his own chief witness.
He told how he arrived here on a Fri
day night last December, met the
woman, got gloriously drunk and came
to his senses a married man. Â¦â¢ He said
there were only a few of the incidents
connected with his wedding that he
could recollect He remembered taking
many drinks, and that was about all.
