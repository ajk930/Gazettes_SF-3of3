An hour before the announcement of
his death was received at the bank a
telegram came from the Comptroller

Following closely on the exciting
events in Lower Allegheny came the
niinouccc-inent from the president of
the bank. Fred Gwynner, that Clarke
loaned thousands of dollars to Penn
sylvania politicians and .that he him-
Belf had indorsed a note for 150,000

Bank Examiner John B. Cunningham
tpent most of yesterday and last night
â¢working on the books of the bank
with the cashier. Shortly after mid
nijrht Clarke complained of not feeling
\u25a0well and started for home. Earlier in
Che afternoon the bank examiner had
been of the opinion that the bank was
insolvent and so notified the Comp
troller at Washington.
At the bank this morning notices were
sent out to the directors for a special
meeting at 2 o'clock this afternoon. One
hour before that time the bank was
closed. The meeting of the directors last
ed about an hour.'affer which President
Frederick Gwynner made the sensational
statement quoted.
According to the examiner's report, the
resources and liabilities of the Enterprise
Bank in the last report, made August 25,
v.ere 52,5?3.170 each. The Enterprise Bank
cleared through the Bank of Pittsburg.
At that bank this afternoon Jt was stated
that sufficient deposits were on hand from
the Allegheny institution to protect the"
clearing-house and that all checks had
b^on pen l back to the original banks.
After -the meeting one of the directors
paid that the books had be*n gone over
hurriendly before the meeting and that so.
far as they knew they were all right.
The director said that Bank Examiner
Cunningham would toegin at once an ex
amination of all the books of the bank.
This will require about five days, he said,
before a statement could be made.
Clarke took his Jife while in his bedroom
Ai his home In Bellevue this morning by
taking poison and then shooting himself
in the right temple. He lingered until
2:30 o'clock this afternoon, without hav
ing regained consciousness.
Clarke was not feeling well this morn
ing and his wife advised him to remain
Jn bed, and he consented to do so. Mrs.
Clarke then went downstairs. At S o'clock
ehe hrard a heavy fall in the room above.
Thinking her husband had fainted, she
hurried to the bedroom and found him
lying on the floor with the revolver still
in his hand. Mrs. Clarke's screams
brought her two daughters and the serv
ants to the room. Physicians were quick
ly called, but their services were of no
avail.
Clarke had taken an ounce of laudanum
nnd then shot himself. The presence of
the *mpty laudanum bottle beside Clarke
when bis wife found him Is a mystery
and seems to indicate that Clarke's at
tempt at suicide had been contemplated
previously, although he had never said
finything which' would lead his lamily to
believe that he Intended to kill himself.
Ciarke had lived In Bellevue for fifteen
years and has always held positions of
the highest honor and trust In his own
community. He represented the Second
Ward in the Bellevue- Council. Clarke
was â¢ member of the United Presbyterian
Church of Bellevue, being a member of
the executive board. He has always taken
an active " Interest in the work of the

, Claim as Capitalist's Daughter Begins.
WOMAN" WHO CLAIMS AS A NATURAL DAUGHTER SHARE OF LARGE ES
TATE LEFT BY CHARLES R.L LOYD. LEOYD WAS INVOLVED ,IN A
SHOOTING AFFAIR IN SAX BERNARDINO TWO YEARS AGO.
The suit of Mrs. Elizabeth Uoyd IVIx to recover, an n natural daughter,
two-fifteenth* of the $373,000 otiate left by the. late Charles R. Lloyd, was
begun yesterday In Oakland.. Letters written by Lloyd to Mrs. A'lx when
she was a girl-in England, in which he acknowledges her as his daughter,
were Introduced. ..She snld'he brought her and. her ntother Bo Oakland
and that she. kept her real relationship a secret on bis promise that- she
should Inherit as bis daughter when he died. \u25a0_\u25a0 / , ,
Mrm. "Six also testified, that she and ber mother, at Lloyd's request,
\u25a0wore to false affidavits denying newspaper fttntcments ... concerning '\u25a0â¢. the
shooting of Lloyd by bis nephew, A\Uli:im lioxnll, 11 1 $nn Bernardino.
OAKLAND, Oct. JB.â Away back in the
sixties, in merry. England, Charles R..
Lioyd, who recently died in Berkeley,
leaving*a large estate, became engaged to
wed Miss Mary Scan of Bristol. The pub
lication of the banns was cekbrated with
a dinner on the birthday of the Prince of
Wales, now King of England. The royal
birthday, outweighing the matter of the
Intended marriage as a cause for merry
making, tended to lessen the importance
of the latter and Lloyd's suggestion that
It be postponed was accepted by the
young woman, with the result that it
never took place at all, though she took
his name. A daughter was born to her,
however, 'and that daughter Is now Mrs.
Elizabeth Lloyd Wx.?Jfc?ZÂ±s
This is the substance of a statement
made in court this morning by Attorney
Frank jfowers, who represents Mrs. Nix
In a suit brought bjÂ« her >to obtain, as
Lloyd's natural daughter, a two-flf teenths
share of the J375.000 estate left by him.
Lloyd never disowned his daughter, ac
cording to letters and photographs that
he sent her, which were Introduced In
evidence to-day. The fact that he; sent
money to England and brought both her-
Belf and mother out to this country and
established them In a home on ' Market
street in this city was also told. She as
serts that In consideration of the . fact
that Â«he should be as a daughter to him,
but at the same time keep secret the>real
fact of that relationship, he said he would
treat her just as his other children when
It came to the disposition of his property.
Instead of this the father bequeathed her
a paltry $5000, and to-day the trial. of her
suit for the specific performance of his
contract was begun before Judge John
Ellsworth. :
At the; end of the statement by Attorney
Powers, lie "and M. C. Chapman, who Is
associated with him, put the daughter,
now of forty summers, on the stand to
tell of " the promise made to her?byrher
father. In order to lead up: to this,; she
told of how she went to Newstead station
at Birmingham, England, to meet him the
first time she ever saw him that she re
members .of. This was when; she was 14
years of age. She said that he pattedher
on the cheek and told her that she; looked
like him and ' that they, must be : good
friends. Then he; returned to America..

In one of the letters written to her from
the Hotel ; Brewster, San; Diego. "April 7.

aft?r stating that he contemplated a trip
to England: ' . ';-., ;

for a position for Mr. Mofflttâ he writes a
very sensible letter. How have you ex
palined to him our relationship? Does
he know everything,' or does he suppose
that your mother and I have been* di

can come to California without hearing of
Mrs. Lloyd being -in England, educating

"Liverpool to San. Francisco. I dare not
chance your coming all alone, although
you would be quite safe. I sent a young
girl of 18 from, here: to London last year
and she got through without any trouble."
, Further on the writer promises to | es
tablish a: fancy or millinery store for
mother and daughter and to get a position
for Mr. Moffltt;. concluding with : "Now,
no engagement or : marriage is to ba
thought, of until you have been here six
months."
That". Lloyd feared that Bessie would

There are letters written :to her after

the subsidiary companies of the National
Asphalt Companyâ assisting . the jj Matos
revolutionary , movement by. contributing
large sums of money to Matos. Furman
told him that in Caracas he found Henry

Mr. Roosevelt to Act as,

Vouchsafed the Public
Special Dispptch to The' Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18. â President
Roosevelt took extreme measures in his
policy of no publicity for the doings of
his administration to-day by sending. to
each '.member of the Cabinet, just before
he left for his Southern trip, a letter for
bidding them, in set terms, to make pub
lic any matter discussed at Cabinet meet
ings or tq discuss with any special corre
spondents any policies, either of the ad
ministration or of their own departments.
The Presleient forbids the Cabinet mem
bers to say anything about any matter
in contemplation until that matter be
comes, the fixed policy of the Govern
ment.
The President's letter" to the Cabinet
members is severe in its tone. It docs
not say that it would be better for Cabi
nft ministers not to talk about policies,
but says Cabinet members "must not."
This latest development in the Presi
dent's policy of secrecy is fostered and
encouraged by Secretary Root. In fact,
Mr. Root is responsible for the letter sent
out to-day. Mr. Root has never liked
newspapers or newspaper correspondents.
Hp has had too many embarrassing ques
tions askid^of.him about, matters with
which he has been connected. ;. The Presi
dent has taken Mr. Roct's advice and has
assumed the 'task of keeping all informa
tion from the public, -except such little
bulletins as may be put out by Secretary
â¢Loeb. \u25a0â¢ ' ; '
It is assumed that any Cabinet member
who talks to a newspaper correspondent
will De disciplined and if is also likely
that any- correspondent who prints any
thing the President does not like will be
disciplined also. Still .the fact that Cabi
net members told of the circular letter
makes it seem that, perhaps, there, may
be som? ne-ws obtained from Cabinet
members after all.

TUCSON,' Aris., Oct. IS.-Because the
members" of the Council - overlooked a
primrry election law passed by the Legis
lature; this spring, the city can have no
election this falj and the Coundlmen,
whose terms would have expired, will
have to hold over for another year, as
they were elected to serve until their suc
cessors are elected and qualified.
The new primary election law requires
thirty days' notice cf the primaries to be
given. The latter must be held thirty
days before the election, which fails on
December 11. This' -notice was never
jriven and there is now insufficient time
reuisinlng to comply with the law. The
Councilmen discovered their blunder to-^
day, but can find no way to get around
the law. 'iÂ»ie situation is grave, as bond
issues aggregating $175,000 -for water
works were to be submitted to the peo
ple, and a year's work by expert en
gineers may be upset.
The right of a City Council whose mem
bers were not properly elected to perform
any public service is being questioned.
The primary election -law was patterned
after the one in force in California and
had never been before enforced in Ari
zona, as the municipal election in Tucson
is the first to take 'place since its pas
sage. There is a provision in the law pro
viding- for the naming of candidates by
petition, but they cannot belong to any
political party. Thi3 may be resorted to
in the emergency and two independent

"My mother has concealed this oc

"I -have not seen Markham since last
Saturday and I know nothing of his
whereabouts now. He had $6 or 57

and wanted his grandmother to give
him more." ' ,

SPEECH AT LUNCHEON.
When the' President/ finished speaking
the line was re-formed and the march
taken up to the Masonic Temple, where
an elaborate banquet with covers for 400
persons was spread. At the banoust the
President spoke as follows: ' \u0084:
Mr Mayor. Governor and you. my hosts :

the t:me when this nation was boxn (and I
quote gentlemen, Patrick Henry) said: "We

,1 noticed that the statue of Stonewall Jack

TALKS TO THE VETERANS.
After the: President had finished the
party was posed for a â¢ flashlight photo
graph, and were then driven to the L*e
monument, where the Confederate vet
erans from R. Ei L*e Camp. Soldiers'
Home, were gathered to greet the Presi
dent. Irt his address to the old Boldlera
the President touched 'on the \ valor of
the South in the following words:
Here I greet you In the shadow of the
â¢tatue of your mighty commanderr-General.
Kobert 8. . Lee. You and he left us mtmori**,
which, inasmuch as they are part of the mem
ories bequeathed to the entire, country. by all
the Americans who fought in the Civil War.
are to serve forevermore as spurs and Incen
tives to the generations coming after, to teach
us and qur descendants that, alike In peace
and In war, whenever the times that try men'a
souls may come we are to rise level to the
opportunity as you rose- level to your opportu
nity, am: be rtady to, prove, as you proved.;
our willingness to prove our worth by our
endeavor.' '.'-'_
The President was listened to with
great interest and wa3 heartily cheered
by ths gray-clad veterans..
At one point in the line of march to
day the President ' shook hands \ with
Giles O. Jackson, president of the Devel
opment ; and Jamestown Exposition Com
pany, and addressed a gathering of ne
groes. .. :
During Mr. Roosevelt's progress
throughout, the city, he showed, special
interest in the school children lined up
to greet him, the whites on one side of
Broad street,'., the/blacks on the other.
He was much amused at another point by
the appearance of a huge stuffed bear,

SAN* LUIS OBISPO. Oct 18.â "Samuel
Dupree is my name an* I'm not ashamed
of it, even If I do get full once in a while.
There's worse faults than getting full,"
was the only excuse offered by Samuel
Dupree for escaping from jail.
Dupree arrived here on Sunday and
went the rounds oi .he saloons, claiming
to be a fortune teller from France. He
proffered to divulge the secrets of the
past and predict the future for a glass of
pure tye. The cheap price appealed to
many saloon-keepers and the frequent li
bations i-ad the usual effect. Dupree be
came a nuisance and he waa thrown out
of several saloons.
With a determination to reform he en
tered an Evangelists tent where services
'were being held. For a moment he was
visibly impressed r.nd the tears rolled
down his cheeks. Then an appeal by
Evangelist Matthews touched his heart to
such an extent that Dupree wanted to
conduct the meeting. He endeavored to
lead in the service, the police were sent
for and the repentant man was locked
up on a charge of disturbing the peace.
The next day he was sentenced to ten
days and waa put .o work cleaning up
the city jail yar-3. He escaped, but was
recaptured. He then explained that he
was. not French, but an Egyptian and
could not resist the temptation to roam
like his ancestors. He again escaped and
the second time managed to get out of
the city, ue was arrested in Arroyo

LIVELY BATTLE
WITH SMUGGLERS
SAN DIEGO, Oct. IS.â Reports from
Ensenada brought by passengers on
the St. -Denis, arriving here to-day, is
to the effect that the capture of the
local schooner Juanita by the Mexican
customs officials was the occasion of
quite a respectable naval battle.'
Five officials left Ensenada late Sat
urday afternoon in an open rowboat.
rowing- the eighteen miles to Santo To
maso beach, near which the alleged
smuggler had been seen the day before
while the captured Elsie was beins
brought into port. The Mexicans
reached the vicinity of their quarry
shortly before midnight.
The aproach of the small boat waa
noted by the Juanita's men while she
was still some rods away, and they,
after shouting to the officers to keep
away, fired a volley from rifle 3. Wo
harm -was done, though the shots
whizzed close by the rowboat. Tho
revenue men then shot back directly
into the schooner, following with a sec

The Juanita showed the *ffecf Â° rtno Â«
battle .in several bullet holes through
her cabin, masts and alongsldea.
' The situation of the captured men.
Captain Osterhause, Ben Journeay and
Frank Fulner, is regarded as serious,

ADVERTISING SESSION
Frominent Delegates Speak Briefly at Big Dinner Held in the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
SOME OF THi: MEN WHO TOOK A PROMINENT PART IN THE SESSIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL ADVERTISING AS
SOCIATION. WHICH CAME TO A CLOSE WITH AN ELABORATE BANQUET AT THE WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL
IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT.
Special Diepatch to The Call.
tfTOV YORK. Oct. IS.â An elaborate
banquet in tae Astor Gallery of the Wal
dorf-Astoria formally closed to-night
the session of the International Adver
tising Association, which has been in
convention here for the last two days,
with delegates present from all parts of
the United States. The convention was
the most noteworthy of its kind ever held.
The great manufacturers, the leading ed
itors and advertising experts exchanged
ideas as to the most advantageous meth
ods of gaining the public ear with results
that promise a new impetus for the art of
advertising.
At the dinner to-night 135 members and
guests were seated at eighteen tables
decorated with American Beauty roses
and cosmos. A large silken American
f.ag hung over the speakers' table, at
which were seated such distinguished or
ators as Charles Emery Smith, editor of
the Philadelphia Press and former
United States Postmaster General: John
McXaught, manager of the San Francisco
Call, and Samuel L. Powers, formerly a
member of Congress from Massachusetts,
row a leading; lawyer of Boston. J.
Hedges of New York acted as toastmas
ter. Charles Emery Smith said:
"Shall I be misunderstood if I say that
the best advertiser in all the world is
Theodore Roosevelt? He Is the be&t ad
vertiser, not because he tries to adver
tise, but because he has the best thing
Â«nd is doing the best thing. He Is the
best big boy at play, whether It be at
hunting bear or In playing at tennis.
He is the best big man at work, what
ever the work may be. He is the best
statesman, because he grasps the larg
est and the broadest and the wisest pol
icies to build up our country and to put
It on a sound and solid basis.
"He Is the best politician, because he
knows best how to seize the public
thought; how to represent the public
thought, and how to carry the people
with him In the great work that he is to
do; the best politician in all the land.
He is the best diplomat because he seized
the right moment, the psychological mo
ment, and brought the warring powers
of the world together at his feet."
JOHN McXAUGHT SPEAKS.
The toastmaster next introduced John
MoNaught. and incidentally remarked
that he came all the way from San Fran
cisco.
"I don't know whether he came here
to get rid of San Francisco," said the
toastmaster, "or whether he came for
come good and wholesome purpose. I
understand confidentially that, outside of
running a good newspaper, he Is the real
thing as an orator. Mr. McNaught trav
eled miles to address you, as far as he
could without falling off this edge of the
continent, and he must have something
good to say." 4
John McNaught said In part:
"Of the great city and the greater
land of which I am here as a represen
tative, I will say but little, for fear if
I speak r-uch of the truth, c\ f en in the
soberest moderation, the words would be
so glowing you would suspect me of being
unaccustomed to the use of wine at din
ner, and that would be a gross injustice
to a Californian. With us romance walks
so close to reality it is difficult to dis
tinguish history from a story, description
from a rhapsody; commerce itself ex
cites visions of Oriental imag
ery and our merchants are almost com
pelled to use the language of poesy when
ever they speak of sending their cargoes
through a golden gate to find a market
among the pearl i lands of the purple
East.
"It suffices to remind you that the
commercial forces. of the world as well
as those of world politics are now . cen
tering In the Pacific, and that upon 'that
greatest of oceans, - he chief city, pres
ent and potential. Is San Francisco. In
that city, therefore, your International
association should hold a convention. I
have no credentials . on that score from
Board of lrade or Chamber of Commerce,
or a.ny organization whatever, but such is
the hospitality of toe land, I have no
hesitation, in assuring" you that if you
come you will find there as cordial a
welcome as you have given to me here."
Congressman Samuel L. Powers of Bos
ton said In part: "Our advertisers : have
made the people of our country more
wise; have lifted humanity and made the
country nearer what it should be; it Is a
country worth fighting- for; it is a coun
try worth dying for, because in this coun
try freedom Â£>t thought is protected by
the Stars and Stripes."
Powers then seized his opportunity to
ring in a free advertisement for Boston,
as Smith and McNaught had done for
Philadelphia and San Francisco.
NATURE OF ASSOCIATION..
The speeches were both witty and
eloquent. Smith's complimentary ref
trences to President Roosevelt were
received with great applause, as was
MeXaught's eloquent and glowing
tribute to California, her climate, her
products, the soil, and last, but not
least, the beauty of California's
women. This was loudly cheered by
the banqueters. It was almost mid
night when the diners arose, after
unanimous agreement that the con
vention had been a success.
The International Advertising Asso
ciation was organized in October,
1904. It has a membership of 171, in
cluding manufacturers, merchants, pub
lishers and advertising agents and so
licitors, embracing creators, users and
venders of advertising space.
J. W. Cassldy of Qulncy, 111., is pres
ident; Delavan Smith of Indianapolis,
Barney Link of Brooklyn and John
Lee Mahin of Chicago, vice presidents;
Winslow Mallory of New York, treas
urer; Thomas Balmer of New York,
secretary; and Clarence B. Hurrey,
manager. : : *< A '
The purpose of the organization is
stated to be to bring together in one
membership all those individuals,
firms or corporations who are inter
ested, either ,as creators, venders or
users of advertising space; to the end
that by co-operation the mutual in
terest of all such may be fostered and
protected; to enlist such membership
in the endeavor to reform abuses; to
prevent waste: to reduce oppressive
burdenp; to collect, classify and di
gest information valuable In relation
to the advertising business. It has
members in all of the Important
cities and towns in the United States,
and several In Great Britain and Can
ada and Cuba.

NEW YORK, Oct, 18.â "Cubans are ne
groes who wear dress clothes."

pearing in Havana after her November
American tour, although arrangements
have been made and bills bearing -her

ed throughout Cuba. On her last tour
of the island her engagement was highly

her tour here she was exceedingly
anxious to return to Havana. In Septem

who for some time made.no reply.. But
a letter ': was received from G. Lawton
Childs, an American banker in Havana,
by :J. JÂ« \u25a0 Farnsworth of New York, in
which Childs Quoted what the divine
Sarah had said and told about the feeling
against her. Before the paper was dry,
he said, most of it had been stripped from
the billboards. â¢ , ..
On receipt of this information Conner
became convinced Jthat real antagonism
existed In Cuba and to-day he cabled to

interview If the phrase credited to her
was untrue. . ;

CASE IS PASSED UP
TO ATTORNEY; JEEOME
Young-ster Says' He Had No
'Dealings -With the Corpora
tion and Repudiates./ the
Signature as a Forgery
NEW YORK, Oct. IS.â The District At
torney's ' oliile was called upon: to-day
by the legislative insurance Investigating
committee because of the testimony' of
one witness, and the/requirement of an an
swer tor porjuiy is now being considered
by Assistant District Attorney Hand. The
witness in question ia George B. ir*lunkeit.
an 18-year-oM telepnone operator in the
employment of 1?.1 W. Lawrence, from
whom the' Mutual Life,; lnsurance Com
pany Durchased a greatTdeal of its sup
plies of stationery.
It was brought out In yesterday's tes
timony that among the, vouchers for
money charged lor expenses was one for
*yi, feigned ay- George U. Plunkett. His
identity was not disclosed ' until to-day,
when Plunkett was called to the' stand.
He testified as to his employment and
when shown the voucher denied that he
had ever signed it. He further denied
that he had ever received that amount
of money from the Mutual Life Insur
ance Company or that he had rendered
the company any service.
-Hughes asked Plunkett to, write his
name in ink on a piece of paper, which
he did. This and the voucher <were; then
offered In evidence and the similarity of
the signatures was called to tâ¢ attention
of the committee.
JEKOME SEXDS HIS DEPUTY; â¢
Shortly alter this incident the sergearit
at-arms was sent to communicate with
the District Attorney's office, and soon
Mr. 'Rand appeared. He was escorted to
a scat beside Chairman Armstrong, and
for a time critically examined signa
tures. All that Kand would say was
that he had betn summoned by Chairman
Armstrong and the matter was now, out
of the hands of the committee and "was
up to the District Attorney's office."
Another feature of the day's hearing
was the passage at arms' netween Chair
man Armstrong, Counsel Hughes and
James M. Beck, counsel for President
McCurdy. Beck accused' Hughes of mis
leading the public 'by 'not -following \u25a0 out
his line of interrogation to the end, and
asserted that he dropped -a -subject be
fore the witness was 'allowed -to 'explain.
Chairman Armstrong then said that the
work of the committee must not be ob
structed.The committee, he said.' want
ed all the Information" it could get that
would be . helpfulj and .the witness j had
placed himself In the position in which
he found himself by his continual eva
sive answers. \u25a0\u25a0
HOUSE KEPT FOll LEGISLATORS.
William A. Carpenter, a clerk in the
supply department of the Mutual Life
Insurance Company, made an excellent^
witness for the committee. His frank
manner and apparent desire to give what
ever, information he could was commented
upon.
Carpenter was under the direction" of
A. C. Fields, the superintendent of this
department, and was. very close- to Fields
in his "legislative supervision" at Albany.
Carpenter told _ of how a house had been
maintained in Albany for several years
at the expense of the Mutual Life. Fields
occupied it only during legislative ses
sions, and on several occasions two mem
bers of the insurance committee of the
Legislature lived -at the house. Carpen
ter leased the house and paid for the:
servants and supplies with, money -of ..'the
Mutual Life. He did not know whether
these members of-the Insurance commit
tee ever shared in the expense; he never
received any money from them, but lie
said they might have paid Fields. No
account was kept of tnese expenditures,
and the money was all received on vouch
ers calling for disbursements for- legal
expenses. A house has been maintained
for a period of. about ten years in Albany
under these conditions, but not always in
the some street.
aicCUHD V PROFESSES IGXORAXCE.
Later in the day,' President McCurdy
was recalled. He said he did not know
that the Mutual Life's funds had been
maintaining this house, although he did
know that- Fields had rented a house to
escape the risk of illness In hotels. He was
assured that | Fields paid $800 rent, j Car
penter said the entire expense of run
ning the house had been about $6500.
An attempt was made by Hughes to
day to get trace of Thomas D. Jordan, for
mer controller of the Equltabje Life So
ciety. Frank, B. Jordan was called under
a subpena and he said he saw his father
last Labor : day. 1 a He â¢ did . not know then
that he was going away, and did not
know where he was now. Under per
sistent questioning/ by Hughes, young
Jordan said no > mail was forwarded to
his' father, and that he did. not know
whether his father or his mother -were
living or dead.-, ' ..â¢<", :;;\u25a0;â¢
: Edgar W. Rogers, a clerk for L. W.
Lawrence & Co., was called and was
represented by John D. Stanchiield. Rog
ers Is also president of the Globe Print-
Ing Company.. He was shown the Plun
kett and said he was of the
opinion that the signature on the voucher
and that, written by Plunkett on the stand
were identical. He did not . recognize

PARTRIDGE FORCES SPREAD DISMAY
IN CAMP OF SCHMITZ.
John S. Partridge, candidate for Mayor on the platform of common honesty in aff^rsj'bfr^muhicipal'governjTient,
?s making a brave'and "convincing campaign. All Ihe signs point to a triumphant uprising of the people-in support of L his
candi jacv. Frcm one end of the city {q the r other men of all conditions are pledging^ their loyalty to the Fusion nominee;
VOTERS OF TWO; DISTR.ICTS GREET' THE- MSION CANDIDATE
Forty-Second Upholds Its Primary Record and
Rallies Against the "Gangsters." |
SCHMITZ'S AUDIENCE OUTNUMBERED
Boss' Lack of Power in Forty-First Shown by
Difference in Meetings Held.
Spurred on by the great attendance at
Teutonia Hall In the Thirtieth District
Tuesday night, the voters of the Forty
second filled Saratoga Hall to the doors
with massed humanity, eager to hear the
wordg of the fueion candidates headed
by John S. Partridge. The announcement
of the fusion standard-bearer that the
grafters are on the run is spreading
through the districts like wildfire and
was heard on many lips at the meeting
last night. The words of Partridge have
FÂ«-t the voters thinking, and that means
votes.
Speaker after speaker was cree(ed with
applause and cheers by the crowd that
filled the seats, lined the sides of the
building on the floor and in the gallery,
and tilled the rtar of the hall to the broad
etalrs beyond. Brandenstcin was in the
midst of his flaying of the administra
tion when John S. Partridge entered the
hall. : :
Those of tiie Schmitz retainers who were
present to size up the meeting and report
to Boss Ruef will have a sorry tale to
tell him this morning when they describe
the mighty greeting that was given the
tuÂ«ion leader as he was hustled down the
aisle to the stage. And a sadder tale
still will be thflr account of the reception
accorded to the candidate's speech and
the ovation at its conclusion and at the
end .of the meeting.
THIIMFIIAVT UPRISING.
Mr. Partridge, when presented, spoke
in part as -follows:
Thl* campaign is developing Into a triumph
ant uprising of the people. I always knew we
couW win. but 1 never hoped for anything like
this. From orb end of the city to the other
men cf all conditions are pledging their support.
The meetings have exceeded la numbers and
.I.:!.!:.-;...- ::i anything 1 have ever seen in San
Francisco.
And the impudence of the grafters is all
gene. Hesitation has taken the place of bold
nt<*s. Tuesday, and again to-day, there wens
hurried and furtive meeting* tn the Mayor's
olfice, and Ma<-Ftretti and other* were .seen to
come out with blanched races and frightened
eyes; the gang is utterly and absolutely de
moralized.
Am<<ng other thinps our indictment charges
that the administration haÂ» deliberately de
stroyed the civil service system, and the evt
o'enet is complete. In their Â«cnemes to build
up a powerful political machine the adminis
tration has nullified the civil service provUlfins
of thÂ« charter in brawn disregard ofThe will
of the IK-ople
A KUtmertiXÃt Oivll Fervice Comiuitsion ha*
not raisod Its voice acaintt the appointment of
men owing allegiance omy to the administra
tion to tbe delusion of tne civil 6ervlce men,
nor has it held any examination \u25a0 worthy the
name ?ince the adminiFtration got full control
of th* municipal departments. In his vetj
message of the financial budget of WO-4 the
Mayor vetoed every arpropriation for salaries
Â«hith wa* made with the prevision that the
salary be paid oniy to civil eervlce men.
APPEALS TO WOMANHOOD.
The presiding officer of the evening was
Frank Macbeth, who was the popular
choice for the oosition. He introduced
the first speaker, A. M. Johnson, who
was followed by John A. McGee and M.
J. Hync-s. At the conclusion of Hynes'
speech Henry U. Brandenstein was intro
duced and was warmly greeted.
Brandenstein's address was a masterly
appeal to the voters to put out of power
the grafters who are disgracing the city
in the eyes of the nation. He refuted the
lies that Ruef has so grossly uttered in
relation to Mr. Brandenstein's private
life and apologized to the audience for
being confiiclled to mention the name of
the arch grafter whose level is below
that of the gang that is gathered about
him: I
Brandenstein proudly asserted his pur
ity of personal character, and his refer
ence to Ruef as "King of the Muck
heap" brought forth rounds of applause.
General Woodruff followed with a charac
teristic speech, appealing to the woman
hood of his female hearers to aid the
manhood of the city in driving back the
tide of filth and corruption that is fill
ing the City Hall.
The meeting broke up at the close of
Mr. Partridge's speech and hundreds
crowded around the candidate to shake
his hand and assure him of their loyalty
and admiration of his cause. From one
end of i Ban Francisco to the other the
citizens are turning out to hear and cheer

Eat Right and
Jeel Right
Take Care of Your Stomach and You
Will Escape No End of Trouble
âOne Perfect Food.
Some people resort to drugs for every
little ache or pain â drugs which maj-
Etitrtulate but which cannot cure, if, in"-
deed. there really Is anything to be
cured.
Many of the ills with which we are
afflicted are due solely to eatine -the
wrong kind c.t food, or eating too Tiucb
or not gottisg. enough exercise to prop-
erly digest whÂ»t we do eat.
We can't abuse the stomach without
paying a penalty. This penalty Is most
frequently indigestion, with all Us ac-
companying distress. Eat the right
kind of food and you will not suffer.
.And the right kind of food isn't med-
icine \iX all. It's a natural malted
whole \v!ie;\t food. Malta-Vita, the must
delicious, the most satisfying food In
the world, always fresh and crisp, con-
taining" every food element necessary
for sastt-nance and upbuilding of the
body and the train.
( A perfect breakfast is impossible
without Malta-Vita. Being a pure
ifrain product it is rich in food ele-
ments â all the food elements of the
best white wheat grown and the tinest
barley malt extract â Intensely vital-
izing and easy for even the weakest
stomach to digest. Just the food to be-
gin the day with, and it's good threÂ«
times a day.
"I had been a sufferer from nervous
debility and indigestion for several
year*, without any benefit "or relief
from various tonics and other medical
prescriptions. Imagine my surprise
when, a short time after beginning the
use of Malta- Vita I became aware of
it* beneficial effects by the gradual dis-
appearance of my long-standing ail-
ment. JkCalta-Vita." Is incomparable in
its nourishing, digestive and strength-
ening><iuslities and is. deserving 'of the
greatest praise." P. Gersper; Barnes-
ville. Ohio. .
All grocers sell Malta Vita. Try some
with cream or fruit. You never tasted
anything sq sroÂ«xl and you will be glad
we told you about It- Ready to eat.
Partridge, and the slocan of tho cam
paign from now until the finul triumph
on election day will be "The grafters are
on the run."
WILL TALK OX DEPARTMENTS. '
Partridge PrumUeit Voters He Will
Turn Searchlight on CommlÂ»Miqna. v
That more voters did not greet John
S. Partridge in the Forty-first District
last night was owing: to the size
Steimke Hall, for the little hall was
packed to suffocation and many were
turned* away. Again the handwriting
on the wall becomes apparent when, it
is known that in this very hall scarcely
a week ago Schmitz stepped to the plat
form and urged the people standing 1 , in
the rear of the hall to come forward
and fill the unoccupied chairs near the
rostrum.
Louis H. Mooser â¢' presided and
squelched an incipient cheer for the op
position at the beginning of the meet
ing, and from that time until the end
there was no sound but the applause
and cheers for Partridge. A
The meeting was opened by a speech
from Edmond Godchaux, showing the
work of the Recorder's office. He was
followed by Henry U. Brandenstein,
who was introduced as the man who
as District Attorney will put tho grart
ers where they belong.
Brandenstein said that the campaign
had revolved itself into a test~^o see
how much the city and county of San
Francsico would stand for in the way of
graft. He added that thfe men on the
fusion ticket are not claiming to be
puritans, but they indignantly resent
the accusations of the grafters that
they are libertines.
Prior to the close of Brandenstein's
speech, Partridge entered and was
heartily received. He spoke in part as
follows:
Friends, this is a fampalgn oF the flreFlde
lamp against the tenderloin licht; in other
words. It Is a campaign that may save your
boys from ruin and your girls from de
bauchery. , ,
Do ycu want Abe Ruef for Mayor or do you
want me? We tell you there Is grogs graft;
Kuef tells you I live in Berkeley. We tell you
there is thievery and corruption in every de
partmÂ»nt; Ruef tells you I live in Berkeley.
That is the only thing he can advance as an
lswjt '.n the fight against me personally. The
only other thing is his cry of Citizens Alli
ance. Both cries are lies and mislead but a
few. It Is to these few I appeal.
Night by night I Intend to take. up the city
departments and tell the truth about fhem. j
The administration is Indicted for deliberate
and premeditated attempt to nullify those pro
visions of the charter which Drovtda for the
acquisition and maintenance, of various public
utilities. The Mayor Is nightly telling his
audiences that he is In favor of the acquisition
of munclpal ownership of euch things as
water, gas, telephones and street railways, and
yet his record shows that It has been consist
ently against them.
The charter makes It mandatory upon the
city government to proceed regularly, system
atically and persistently to acquire public util
ities, and the JBoard of Supervisors, ever, since
the new charter was adopted, have attempted
to carry It out. as they have attempted to
carry out all the provisions of that Instrument.
The Supervisors appropriated $."i50,r,00 to
commence work on the Geary-street roi"!. The
Mayor publicly stated In an interview ..iat he
doubted the expediency of constructing that
road. He further attempted to hamper in every
way the preliminary work, and he stated that
the plans as prepared by Mr. Stut could net be
carried out. It vat only when he was forced to
do bo by the pressure of one of the dally
papers that he consented to go ahead with the
work.

"BUKLIXGTON PLANS .
TO EXTEND ITS LINE
May Build From Guernsey,
Wyo.. Through to Salt |
Lake City. .
OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 18.â It ia stated on
undoubted authority that the Burlington
is strongly contemplating building a line
from Guernsey, Wyo., through to Salt
LÂ«ake by way of Granger, Wyo., and that
a surveying party has been fitted out at
a cost of thousands of dollars and sent
Into that region for a careful study and
laying out of the way.
A Dromlnent official of the Burlington
remarked to-day that the Burlington
wculd do more railroad building this fall
thau any other of the Western roads.'
A survey was made from Guernsey to
Granger and to Salt Lake four years
ago, and there has been more or less
talk of the line 'ever since.- There is a
big stretch of good territory between
Guernsey and Granger, and it is deemed
a paying proposition to push the ". line
Into Salt Lake City, where connections
would be made with the Western Pacific.
The new line will be approximately 500
miles in length and will run almost paral
lel to the Union Pacific across Wyoming,
crossing the overland route at v Granger.
When the Guernsey line was con
structed it was built with eighty-pound
rails â seldom laid on a branch line of
that class. This Is considered .. another
significant fact. The Guernsey line- is
more than 100 miles In length. %:Â£:

ELECTION COMMISSIONERS
TRY TO EVADE THE LAW
Scheme 'to HelpVSchrait^ Evokes
a Letter From Partridge.
The Election Commissioners, in their zeal to help Ruef and Schmitz, en
deavored to keep secret the list of election' officers for the various precinct
boards. All parties are clearly entitled under the law to know all about the
official affairs of the Department of Elections. When the Commissioners were
brought before the Superior Court to show cause why the names of the
lected, elation officers should not be given to the public they -threw- up- tneir
hands and promised to reveal thelists. The proceedings in court had the effect
desired by law-abiding citizens. v- - \u25a0 \u0084 ."
Rumor Is now rife that the Commissioners, through some sort of juggling to
evade the law. propose to place on the official .ballet \u25a0 the farcical nominations
made by bunches of so-called "Independent pemoc^ts'/ and "Independent ne
publicans." Last Tuesday night the Ruefters filed two petitions, arid in 1 one pe
tition the prayer is made that Schmitz shall go on the ballot as the nominee
of the "Independent Democrats" and in the other that his name shall go on as
the nominee of "Independent Republicans." Schmitz is the regular nominee or
the Union Labor party convention, and as such his name goes on the bailor, m
Every one knows that the purpose of the petition is to enable voters to vote
for a candidate who ia not the nomirffee of a convention. The laW also hoiaa
that persons who voted at the. primary election for delegates to a nominating
convention are not entitled to sign a petition in behalf of an independent nomi
! Regular Republicans and .Democrats are positive that the petitions filed night
before last by the Ruefters contain th e names of hundreds of men who partici
pated in the recent primary election. Registrar Adams is already comparing . me
names of the petitioners with the list of registered voters. It is his duty also to
scan the list of voters at the recent primary election in order to ascertain
whether the petitioners have not forfeited their right to petition in this case.
Republicans and Democratic leaders comprising the Fusion campaign com
mittee have looked Into. the law governing the Commissioners and Registrar or.
Voters, and if attempts are. made to evade It or set it aside the, courts will oe
appealed to at once. . , -â¢< 'J!jLÂ£\l
There- is gossip in political circles that the Commissioners propose to permit
the use of the designation "Independent Democrat" and "Independent Republi
can" on the , official machine ballot: A writ of mandate from the Supreme
Court may be necessary to bring the Ruef gangsters to a sense of their duty. .
The. decisions are. clear and direct to the point that misleading and con-.
fusing designations, are not permissible. Â«' â¢'- Q W : \u2666 i*
There is no Republican nominee for Mayor other than John'S. Partrmge.
There i&no Democratic nominee for Mayor other , than ,John S. Partridge.
Each party nominated him in due form and in accordance with, the Jaw.
providing for the selection of delegates at a primary election. .â¢ There is no
Union Labor nominee for Mayor other than Eugene E. Schmitz, as he was
regularly nominated .by a convention created under the law. What, would:
Eagan and Berger. think if a proposition to place Partridge on the official
ballot as the "Independent Union Labor" candidate? ,'V/
John S. 'Partridge, nominee for Mayor, yesterday addressed the follow
ing letter to every member of the Board of Election Commissioners:
"SAN FRANCISCO. Cal.. Oct! 18, 1905.
"To the Honorable James A. Devoto. Elmer G. Lefflngwell, Thomas McGuire
and A. W. Voorsanger,, Constituting the Board of Election Commission
ers of the City and County of San Franciscoâ Gentlemen: I am informed
that two petitions, have .been- filed .with you nominating certain persons to be
voted for at the coming election under the titles, 'Independent Republican
party' arid 'Independent -Democratc party.' As the nominee of the conven
tions of the Republican- and- Democratic parties, I wish to protest against
allowing the persons named An said petitions a place on the sample ballot
and voting machines to bfe used at said election, for'Uhe following reasons:
"First Because the designations, 'Independent Republican party' and
'Independent Democratic party,' are the same as or so similar to those of
other existing parties as to mislead voters.
"Second â Because the persons seeking to have their names on the ballot
as 'independent' nominees or . 'candidates' for public office 'nominated other
wise than by a convention,' are not 'independent candidates' or candi
dates 'nominated otherwise than by a convention,' but are the nominees of
the convention of the Union Labor party, and as such entitled to a place
on the ballot. â¢â¢ 1 .. .
"I therefore request that you prepare the sample ballot to be mailed to
the voters of said city and county at said election and the voting machines
to be used at said election by placing in the first or top column the nomi
nees of the Republican convention, under the heading 'Republican ticket';
In the second column the nominees of the Democratic convention, under the
â¢heading 'Democratic ticket'; inithe. third column the nominees of the So
cialist convention, under the .heading 'Socialist ticket,' and in the foutrh
column the nominees of the Union Labor convention, under the heading
'Union Labor ticket,' and that said sample ballot and voting machines be
prepared without separate columns for the names of the persons named In
said petitions and without the designations 'Independent Reput/lican party*
or 'Independent Democratic party.* Very truly yours, , ,:

I That Partridge's Majority

GEAFTEES ARE ALAEMED
Eepoit Is Current That Ruef
Is Advising Another Tax
on All Liquor Dealers
fThe camp of the grafters .is' in .â¢ a
feverish, state \u25a0' of : alarm. - Deputies
are 'scampering-- around \ the^ City Hall,
telephone hells are ringing and special
(Sails are going out to: summon^ all the
Ruef ters on the; municipal payroll to
a council.
It is whispered in the corridors of
the hallthat "Eugene is scared." The
great demonstration for Partridge in
the heart of â¢ the Thirtieth *, Assembly
District struck terror to the gangsters.
Leaders in the army of graft are giv
ing all sorts of advice. Eagan and Mc-
Carthy advise that Ruef be "bottled
,up." When Ruef hears this he may di
rect the Mayor to kick out Eagan and
McCarthy.
Many of the wage-earners are ascrib
ing: the unfortunate condition of the
May orB campaign to P. H. McCarthy,
who is said to be the arch hoodoo of
the century in politics. Others aver that
the cause of the calamity to the gang-
Bters . can be traced to Ruef "s meeting
at tho Alhambra Theater. There is
quite a diversity of opinion as to the
cause, but all the grafters agree on the
remedy. Another tax. is to be levied.
The licjuor men in general and the sa
loon-keepprs in particular are to be
assessed again for campaign expenses.
Eugene is so badly frightened and'Ruef
is so completely rattled that nothing
less -than- a. bisr "hold up" can restore
serenity.
At the headquarters of the fusion
forces, 636 Market street, the utmost
confidence prevails. Tlje leaders, speak
ers and district workers are so san
guine of overwhelming^ victory -.for
Partridge that one is inclined to utter
warning 'against the danger of over
confidence. The analysis of regis 1
tration.'the attendance on fusion meet
ings south of Market street, the .char
acter . of . Partridge's, speeches ' and the
cordial greetings accorded /to I him by
the workingmen are accepted as unfail
ing signs of victory. . -
~ The campaign committee, through its
auxiliary agencies, is now giving spe

districts. The organization is so com
plete, and effective that every voter in
the city can be advised to use his per

of common honesty.

NEW YORK, Oct. IS.â While there was
a flood of McClellan money offered in
Wall street to-day at odds of from 10

would receive . more votes than Hearst.
One large bet of. the day was that of

-Well, he, reported that there was a

â¢'Possibly because of the swell."
. "When the mate called you, did he

though he were awake?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did the third officer carry out all your

*Yes, except that I considered the

Captain Randall brought out the fact
that Holmes had been discharged from

I* - Johnson, who hap
pened to be on deck just. before the.ves

Anderson, who was on' the loolcout when
the veÃiseJ struck, was asked why he did

the St. Paul was too close inshore."
"I thought that he would see that him

'â¢Didn't you consider it your duty to
report to the officer on watch?"
â¢1 guess it was, but I thought that
he could see for himself."
â¢At 2:15 you knew the vessel was get

"Yes, sir.'"
"And at 2:30 you saw that it was still

"That's so."
"Well. I want to tell you right here,"
said Inspector Bulger, "that you are not

HEX MATCHES BROOD
JX SMALL TIN PAIL
Selects a "Nest" Hanging
Ten Feet Above the
Ground.
Ppecla! Dispatch to The Call.
RIVERHEAD. L. 1., Oct. 18.â An old
hpn owned by Asa D. Fordham chose a
tin pail, hung about ten feet from the
floor, as the place in which to bring up
Â» family. She laid ten eggs and hatched
every one of .them, the family "coming
off" "the nest to-day.
This high-minded hen selected a tin
pall home unknown to her owner. Being
released from a coop daily, she went to
an old building, wherein hung the pail. It
must have bern quite a "stunt" to fly up
to the pail and get safely within without
brpakir.g the eggs that had been laid
from day to day. but it was accomplished
without accident, in spite of the Xact
that thcrÂ«Â» was net the least bit of stFaw
for the nest. The .pail was a deep one,
v.hieh made the feat of balancing her
h^nship on the edge while she got in
all the more difficult. How she ever got
out is still more wonderful.
After the chicks were hatched, the hen
was "up against" a propositionâ how to
pet them down to the ground. Mr. Ford
ham happened to go into the building
this morning and heard the peep of the
chicks. He looked carefully around, but
could find none for a long time. Finally
he traced the popping to the pail and
there found ten chicks with none of the
comforts of home. He took them outside
and prepared a new home In the sunshine.

CARTER POSES
AS A DREYFUS
Convicted Captain Claims to
Be Victim of Conspiracy
on Part of Army Officers
CHICAGO, Oct. IS.â Charges of con
spiracy among- army officers, made by
Oberlln M. Carter, who was convicted of
embezzling $3,000,000 from the Government,
enlivened the proceedings befoie Special
Examiner Wyman to-day. In reply jto
questions of Assistant United States At
torney General Erwin, Carter asserted
that the finding of the qourt-martlal
which declared Carter guilty was the re
sult of a conspiracy among the officers
constituting the court-martial.
"I was condemned: .and sentenced -to
prison on secret testimony at -a hearing
where neither myself nor. my attorney
were allowed to be present," slid Carter.
"That Is why I was insistent on obtain
ing a trial in a court of justice, where I
could confront my accusers and summon
witnesses. If I could have met my fath
er-in-lew, R. F. Westcott, In open court,
I know he would have told the truth. As
it was, he was a. feeble old man, and the
Government representatives worried him
into signing the statement which is now
used as his testimony."
"Why should the Government give you
another trial, after a military court-mar
tial of three months' investigation had
found you guilty and you were serving
the sentence in prison?" asked Erwin. ,
CALLS GRIGGS CORRUPT.
"Because I never had- a fair trial."
shouted Captain Carter. The investiga
tion by the court-martial was an infa
mous farce. General Otis, the presiding
officer of the court-martial, was found
: one night In the office of the prosecuting
attorney plotting . to have me convicted.
My attorney and myself learned that
General Otis had left the hotel s*ecretly
to conspire with the prosecuting attorney,
and we made an investigation, and found
him and other members of the court
martial in secret- "session with "the Gov
ernment attorneys. They walked! a mile
and then climbed five flights of stairs
after the elevator stopped running, so
as to be alone."
"You charge that General \- Otis and
other members of the court-martial en
tered . into conspiracy,: to send you", to
prison?" :
"I do, and -I know, what lam
about," replied, the witness. " "The late
President William McKlnley was an
honest man from the top ot his head. to
his toes, but I was advised that Attor
ney General Griggs was corrupt."
"How do you know Attorney General
Griggs was corrupt?" \u25a0 . r \u25a0
"Because a high official -of the Penn
sylvania Railroad told me," replied the
witness. "He said his road ran through
New Jersey, and. he had reason to know
of Mr. Griggs'. character. He advised me
to have nothing to do with him."' .'
PRIVATE PAPERS SEIZED.
Carter described the manner, in which
his books and private . papers were seized
by Government officers while he was ab
sent in October. 1599.* Certain papers which,
he said, he intended \u25a0to use to prove
that many of the prosecution's 'witnesses
committed perjury at the investigation
by the court-martial are missing.' He ac
cused the officers- of the court-martial,
and the board of inquiry with, having
taken them in order to deprive him \of
the use of the documents at his defense.
He accused a member of the court-mar
tial (Captain Gillespie) and others ot hav
ing copied, many of the personal letters
while the documents were in their pos
sion. He also accused the Government :
officers of neglecting to' return' several
pieces of personal property, .which; he
highly prized. One of these was -a piece
of the flag which floated over .* Fort
Sumpter when the fort was first fired
upon In 1861, and - another was a letter'
from his wife . signed "Sweet Ann," and
containing a lock \u25a0of her hair. /. ;

Special Dispatch to The Call.
". NEW YORK, Oct. IS.â A verdict, in
favor -of .the plaintiff . by order of the
court ; was returned to-day by the jury
which heard the testimony before Judge
Greenbaum in the Supreme Court in the
acjion brought by William J. Zeller
against. Joseph Leiter. of Chicago to re
cover $52,021 on a promissary note made
by f Leiter to the Allen Greer & Zeller
Company, a firm started in IS9B to deal
in options of wheat. The verdict was
for ?6D,767, which included interest since
December, : 1898.
The plaintiff sued as assignee .of the
note ; from Allen Greer and the Zeller
Company. The x note was payable three
years after . date, but on December 16,
1901, was dishonored and protested.
The plaintiff alleged, that the note was
given in \ settlement of .an account run
ning 'between- the firm and Leiter, when,
acting for Leiter in his endeavor to cor
ner trie â¢''_ wheat market, { tney purchased
millions of. bushels of wheat.
Leiter set up the defense that under
the laws of Illinois the transactions came
within the definition of gambling and
that the amount of the note was there
fore irrecoverable. He further, alleged
that the books of the, Allen Greer & Zel
ler .Company contained" fraudulent and
fictitious entries, which made a difference
of v more- than the amount of the note.
Judge Greenbaum denied the motion to
dismiss the action on the ground that the
amount of the note could not be re
covered as a gambling debt and directed
a verdict for the full amount with in
terest. The attorneys of Leiter gave
notice ' of an appeal.

UNUSUAL SKULL
SAVES ELLIS
Andrews' Blow
Could Not
Break It
Freak of Nature
Cheats Noted
Murderer.
BERKELEY, Oct. 18.â It was discovered
to-day by Dr. Allen F. Glllihan, who has
been in charge of William Ellis' case
since the latter was removed to the Roose
velt Hospital, a victim of Milton Andrews'
blow with a hammer, that Ellis' skull is
twice as thick as that of an ordinary
man.
But for this feature -of Ellis' anatomy,
Di. Gillihan declares that his patient
surely would have been killed by the
blow dealt by Milton Andrews.
Dr. Glllihan to-day measured the "but
ton." the bit of skull which was taken
from Ellis' head at the time of the opera
tion in the hospital, and found that It is
exactly twice as thick as that of the or
dinary man. Where the average man's
skull Is. but three-sixteenths of an Inch
in thickness, Ellis' skull is three-eighths
of an inch through.
A peculiar feature of the case is that
the portion ol the brain just beneath the
part that recflved the hammer stroke is
the part where center the nerves that di
rect the trunk, legs and feet of the bodyâ
the locomotive part, in other words. Had
the blow been received by an ordinary
man, he never would have been able to
move his legs or feet. His skull would
have been crushed in at the very point
wfure the nerves direct the movements of
the lower part of the body, and he would
have been an easy victim.
. r. Gillihan said to-day:
Ellis ha* the thickest skull that I have ever
Men In a human being. In the ordinary man's
case the occipital protuberance Is the thickest
part of the skull, and near the base of tha
bT&ln is about three-quarters of an Inch
through. As the skull runs up to the peak it
becomes thinntr, and at that particular point
where Ellis received the blow, from Andrews*
hammer, which point we would call the parle-
Ul section. Jurt over the Rolando tissue, the
skull Is rarely more than three-sixteenths cf
an inch in thickness. The button which I have
removed and examined, however, is fully threo
eighihs of an inch through. The button is
cracked and broken by the blow from the ham.
rr.er, but the measurement Is exact, despite the
crack.
We know that negroes are supposed to have
very thick skulls, but of course Ellis Is not a
negro, nor has he any negro blood In him. He
simply has ar, abnormal development of the
skull at that particular point that received the
blujv from Andrews' hammer. . .
The Rolando fissure covers the convolution of
the brain where center the nerves that diw'ct
the movements of the lower limbs. Had the
skull net been of such extraordinary thickness
at thai, point the man never could have been
able to move his boJy. ana so it becomes extra
ordinary that he was able to move, to fight, to
escape, and then to walk a distance of several
blocks until rescue came to him. '
It was in treplning the parietal bone that I
took out tne button or bit of skull, which,
when examined now and measured, proves to
be of such unusual thickness.
Tte only damage done to Ellis' head wat to
the dlploe or soft bone strata between the upper
and lower surfaces of the skull. There was not
even a hemorrhage of the blood vessels of the
brain, the only loss of blood sustained being
that from the minute capillary veseels In the
dlploe. 1 operated to relieve the pressure on
the brain, there being no damage done to the
cerebelljm.
Ellis is improving so fast that he will
perhaps be out in a week. He smoked a
cigarette to-day with apparent enjoy
ment, laughed and jested over his narrow
escape from death at Andrews' hands,
and related to visitors some of his experi
ences with Andrews and the latter's
"wife." Ellis has convinced the Berkeley
police that he was merely the dupe of An
drews, and that he was to be slaughtered
when the latter became convinced that
the Australian had determined: to leave
his company.'

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER :19Â§:i?05.
SAYS OFFICER
BATTERED HIM
Teamster Causes Arrest of
.Brother of the Chief
of Police of Oakland
OAKLAND, Oct. IS.â Alleging that the
policeman attacked and beat him .last
Monday morning, J. J. Heavey, a team
ster employed by 'the Merchants' Ex
press Company, this morning swore to
a camplaint charging Patrolman .\V. I.
Hodgkins, a brother of the" Chief of Po
lice, with battery.
Heavey declares that his trouble with
the policeman is the result of an old
grudge, and says that he can prove that
Hodgkins attacked him. without provo
cation.
Hodgkins declares that he struck
Heavey after the latter had attempted to
strike him, and that the teamster has
been a maker Â«f trouble. Hodgkins was
arrested this afternoon and was at once
released on bail. He has made a full
statement of the trouble to his superiors.
The accused patrolman told the fol
lowing story of the trouble after his
arrest:
There has been considerable trouble between
the union and non-union teamsters for some
time, and on Monday a complaint was made
to the agent at the wharf by a lady that
Heavey was usinK frightful language/* I went
to. where he was standing and told him that
ho would have to stop annoying- the other men,
and he made a profane reply, at the same time
putting up his hands to Etrlke me. I know
that he Is a dangerous man, as he was one of
the gang which assaulted Special Officer Mor
rison some time ajjo. 1 did not want to take
any chances with him, bo I knocked him down.
As soon as I had done this some of the ottler
drivers came up and asked me- not to arrest
him, as he had been punished enough, and I
consented, very foolishly; to let him go.
Heavey denies that he was using vulgar
language, abusing any one or attempting
to strike the policeman.

Viewed from his standpoint of experience In
the universities of Europe and America, Pro
fessor Henry Morfe Stephens' remarks before
the women of Ebell to-day were of much mo
ment and more than passing Interest. He
6poke of the deplorable aosence of the knowl
edge th*t is acquired by general reading and
observation and laid the blame at the home's
.hre-hold, Reading â the right kind of reading â
Is not encouraged among tne children of to
day. Children's libraries are built and fur
nished carefully with small chairs, .low tables
and ''baby food" in the way of books! Chil
dren will read real literature when they get it.
but the trend of to-day seems to be to feed the
young Idea with, as Professor Stephens sayÂ«,
baby food.
The problem of proper . foundation layin* It
an Important one and one that women must
solve, for the real education, the education ot
the mind and soul, begins at home.
Profeasor Stephens' views on the present cur
riculum of the high schools was rather Icono
clastic also. He claims tnat the boy who must
take up manual labor at Boon as he leaves
high school or college should have a different
sort or education from the boy who plans to
adopt a professional career; but no child ehouW
bÂ« compelled to learn things that will be ab
rclutely useless to him â¢ later and absorb time
that -might be made more -advantageous.
All In all. Professor Stephens gave his audi
tor* much food for thought, and he was listened
to with keen Interest and appreciation. .

ing craft, " the General Desonls having
made it in seventy-nine sailing days.
The bark left San Francisco February
18 last in ballast for Newcastle, New
South Wales, for a cargo, but finding the
going rates too low her owners ordered
her to Cape Town, South Africa; for or
ders. The Desonis left Newcastle May 17.
making Cape Town in forty-seven days.
From there she was again ordered back
to Hobart for orders by way of Cape
Horn, arriving at Hobart in seventy-nine
sailing days from the time of leaving
Newcastle, and thus circumnavigating
the globe in that time. She was then or
dered to Puget Sound, to load wheat,
reaching "Port Angeles in seventy-one
days with the ballast, taken aboard at
San Francisco eight months ago.

DISCOVERS AEW METHOD
FOR REDUCING MAGNETITE
Expert In tbe Employ of tbe United
States Geological Survey .Makes
Important Announcement
PORTLAND, Oct. 18.â David T. Day,
otilef of the mining division of the
United States Geological Survey, ' has
announced that as a result of experi
ments which have been proceeding dur
ing tho past few months a method has
been discovered for economically re
ducing the magnetite, or black sand,
vast deposits of which are found at
the mouths o( numerous rivers along
the Pacific Coast.
The black sand has long been known
to be rich in iron, but no means have
previously been devised for reducing It
economically and for that reason it has
been . commercially valueless. '{ Day
states that.the'magnetite is richer than
that found on Lake Superior and is
equal in ( every way to the .world-re
nowned Norwegian ores. In one ex
periment he ,' obtained . (583 pounds of
iron from a ton of sand. There are,
according to Day, as many as 600 places
along the coast where the sand is
found.
Magnetite, however, is not the only
result of -, the Investigations here. A
mineral 'called monozite, so known be
cause; It Is so rare, has been discovered
In large quantities within a short dis
tance ofthis city. Monozite. is largely
used in the manufacture of gas mantles,
Another mineral, known as zircon," used
in the production- of light, has also
been found f near Portland. C *

CAUSES HEAVY LOSS
Two Residences and Twenty-
Seven Business Houses
- Destroyed.
RENO, Nev., Oct. IS.â The entire busi
ness section of Alturas, Cal., 250 miles
north of this place, -was destroyed by
fire last night, twenty-seven business
houses and two residences being con
sumed.
The town is wholly without fire protec
tion and the people were compelled to
stand by and allow the fire to take Its
course. The loss will reach $100,000, with
but little Insurance. Two newspaper of
fices, the Republican and Plalndealer,
and the offices of the Western Union Tele
graph Company and the "Well-Fargo Ex

store and business house in the city is
out of ' commission. Nevertheless, the
losers talk bravely and Indications are
that they will set about to rebilild this
time with more substantial structures.
The .Gibson drug store, which was de
stroyed, was valued at $10,000, and owned
by a brother of Dr. S. C. Gibson of
Reno. The property was not insured.

ereui rwlr-dlc. Mrs. Riggle. who con
ducts an Edd /-street lodging-house, gave
further details yesterday of her battle in
beh.-Jf of the Imprisoned men. She re
*JP* story of her secret Journey to
York, where ehe sought to enlist
the services an<3 the financial support of
Wagner la the struggle against the pros
ecuting offlcers of Utah. Mrs. Rlggle
ttrfolded thÂ« c 1c 1 rctimstances of h<r inter
view with the : srrier, of his conferences
with attorney? and of his final refusal to
Klve her the help ehe had beggtd.
Although there was a suspicion that
the woman had an ulterior purpose in
meeting Wagner, and that she might be
charged with having attempted to coerce
Wagner into furnishing the money the
arrested pair required for bail and the
expenses of a defense. Mrs. Rlggle de
nied that she had used any threats or
had done anything that could savor of
blackmail. She insisted that the sub
ject of the alleged Incriminating letters
was not mentioned by herself, though
"Wagner, she asserts, did ask whether
any of his correspondence with Rumsby
was in existence.
"But I evaded the question," said Mrs.
Riggle, "because I had been instructed
not to give Wagner any Information ex
cept such as related to the arrest and
the present condition of the cases."
ADMITS lIVSIXESS DEALINGS.
Wagr.er, it is said, does not deny that
he had business dealingÃ with Rumsby.
but his contention is that his part in. the
transactions was wholly that of a mer
chant selling his wares to a customer
\u25a0who paid cash for them. His explanation
is that two years ago Rumsby went to
him with a story that he was a taxi
dermist ar.d desired to purchase various
wild animal peits for professional pur
poses. Then, according to the furrier's
tale, the shipments were made to desig
nated places in the West, under Rums
by's directions.
The letters that passed between the
m<?n show, according to Mrs. Riggle's In
formation, a closer connection than Wag
ner -would admit. But the woman in
sists she did not learn, even in a most
g-er.eral way, the tenor of the documents
cstil after they had passed to the Utah
officers and had been read by them.
The Eastern journey was made late in
AufruEt, and was taken at the earnest
request of Rumsby, thrcugh the gang's
attorney. H. E. Booth of Sa:t Lake. In
her own words tbe story of the trip fol

"CARMEN" FAILS
AT THE TIVOLI
Large Audience Hears Poor
Singing, Conductor Is Bad
and Rehearsals Are Needed
Mlfes COLMAN CLEVER
Debutante Gives Promise
of Noble Work, Having
a Sweet, Trained Voice
The worst performance of the season,
end the decidedly promising debut of Miss
Alice Colman In the name role, Is the
chief news of last night's "Carmen" at
the Tlvoll.
The Interest naturally went chiefly Miss
Colman's way, to the daring young
woman who follows Collamarini in a iole
in which San Francisco looked twice at
Calve after hearing Its Collamarini. It
was also Polacco's first "Carmen" here.
Good it was not from any side, only in
Infrequent spots, these chiefly Coppola's,
Miss Colman's and again Maestro Dado's,
splendidly wasted on Zuniga. There
should be a prompter. One has felt this
not seldom, and last night the need was
strenuous. The opera was not sufficiently
rehearsed, and Polacco's long-distance
prompting was distinctly disturbing. It
is, too. a distinctly unwise tax upon the
conductor's powers, particularly upon a
conductor of Polacco's make-up, passion
ately desirous of perfection. One side or
the other of the work is bound to suffer,
and the orchestral side suffered last
night. Naturally we were expecting
much. "We know the opera so well here,
and were expecting from Polacco another
if his illumined readings. But it was one
if the least interesting performances of
"Carmen" recently given here, and all by
reasonâ apparentlyâ of Insufficient re
hearsal.
While one is a-grumbllng it is well to
enter another protest concerning the
lights round the proscenium arch. The
Illusion of yet another moonlight scene
went smash through these incongruous
incandescents last night. Moreover, they
are distinctly damaging to the eyes of
the audience.
Now, hp to Miss Colman's Carmen,
which a Tetrazzini limit in audiences
came to greet. It was my first Carmen
debut, but Miss Coleman strikes me as
a very promising debutante. She has re
markable poiseâ though she is "overbusy"
in gestureâ audacity, grace, dramatic in
stinct and a voice. Miss Colman's voice
is not quite equal to the climaxes nor of
any particular distinction, but it is quite
sweet and round. Her fortes are rather
forced, her mezza voces sometimes quite
lost in the orchestral deeps, but Miss
Colman occasionally does some very
pretty singing. Her pitch Is charmingly
true one remembers with much pleasure.
Petulant rather than passionate on the
acting side her Carmen not seldom is, but
as a whole it is surprisingly good. The
dance was of Miss Colman's cleverest
work, and the little duet following was
charmingly eung. Also, had the rest
known their parts in the same thorough
fashion that this young woman showed
she knew hers, the performance would
have been considerably livelier.
Coppola, as usual, had spiendid moments
as Don Jose, with â as usual again â inex
plicable sags between. He did some de
lightful singing, and made a very hand
some picture. Moreo was the Toreador,
and out of It. He has not the heroic
value of voice requisite for the singing of
the role, and neither did he bring his
usual dash and gusto to the part. The
cast went lame again on its Mlchacla.
Miss Tied, who looked pretty as a pic
ture, had her very worst tremolo with
her last nlgat. Grand old Dado brought
benevolence and some big. beautiful notes
to the score as Zuniga, and Lucchlno and
Holmes were apologetic as Frasquita and
Mercedes. It is only fair to say that the
quintette with these, Tlcci, and Signors
Teddy Webb and Cervi went wonderfully
well. But there will have to be work be
tween now and Saturday to pull "Car
men" up to current Tlvoll levels.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
without consulting: his atto n?y. Hi wanted
me to go with him. but I refused, as Attorney
Booth had instructed me to say nothing about
the case except to Wavner. He did have a
conference and his attorney, so Wagner told
me, advised Wagner to have nothing to do with
the case. Wagner said he could tiot afford to
get mixed up in the affair.
INQUIRES ABOUT BETTERS.
During our conveiÃatlon Wagrer askel me
whether any of his letters to Ilumsby were
around. I evaded a reply. He seeint.d to bs
disturbed about them. But after his decision,
he treated me very nicely. With his wife he
took me en several sight-seeing trips to Coney
Island and other interesting places near the
city. An I departed on my return to Cali
fornia, Wagner insisted I should write to him
and keep him informed about the case.
Wagner heard nothing from me. because I
had been directed by Booth to write nothing.
Evidently Wagner did not like this, lor he
wrote me a few / weeks ago to know why I
had not written.*
Wagner's letter to Mrs. Riggle follows:
NEW YORK. Sept. 25. 1005.
Mrs. Mary Riggle.
Dear Madam: It Is quite strange we have
not heard from you, as you promised you would
write when you left New . York. We have
treated you as eooti at we could, and think
you should appreciate this and think you

yours. ERNEST WAGNER & CO.
Continuing her narrative, Sirs. Riggle
said:

Mrs. Riggle said Wagner was a wealthy
man and had very wealthy relatives in
New York.
In an effort, to explain what had be
come of the money said to have been
made by the gang. Mrs. Rlggle said she
could only think it had been squan
dered by her husband and had been
spent in high living and travel by her son
in-law. She declared Rumsby, who has
relatives in England, traveled over
Europe with his wife and lived In the
best of style for months. Mrs. Riggle
thought he had made his money In live
stock transactions.
NEW YORK, Oct. 18.â Ernest Wagner,
furrier, denies all knowledge of either
Mr. or Mrs. Rlggle, and says he has
had no communication with them. He
says the only party he had any dealings
with was Rumsby and that possibly
some of the letters he wrote Rumsby In
answer to inquiries about the purchase
of more wolf and wildcat skins fell Into
other hands.
"Any letters that I may have written,"
said he, "were of a business nature.
They were not at all incriminating, and
I have no fear of prosecution. I know
nothing of any blackmailing threats.
"The skins in question were wolf skins
and a few of wildcats,, and as nearly as
I can remember, . for it has been. about
two years, the whole lot did not amount
to over. $20. This Mr. Rumsby came Into
my place of business - and bought the
skins, telling me *he was a taxidermist
and wanted .to use \u25a0 them to patch other
and more valuable . furs. I sold ; them â¢to
him Just as I would to any. other pur
chaser, without knowing or caring what
they were really intended for. This ; Mr."
Rumsby was then.on his way to Europe;
and I have not seen him since."

KNOCKING THE SAN JOAQUIN.
THE attention of the State Board of Trade has been called to
the knocking at the great valley of California by alleged; real
estate sharps. The circular sent out by these miscreants
reads: "We would strongly advise you to avoid the, great interior
valley which extends from Kern County to Shasta County. We
have seen over and over again men, broken in health from long
residence in those irrigation districts, seeking the coast counties of
Central California tt> recuperate. Why go into these great interior;
valleys of Sacramento, San Joaquin, Fresno, etc., where malaria is
rampant \u25a0 and the heat so excessive that at times even the horses
drop dead in the fields?"
The framer of that circular should remember that Ananias
dropped dead also. Fortunately the State Board of Trade in its
annual reports produces the official record of temperature, which
tells the story of the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys as to
temperature, and compares it with regions near the coast. The
highest mean annual temperatures in the State north of the Te
hachapi are 644 at Bakersfield and 64.4 at Woodland, in Yolo
County. The lowest mean temperatures are Sacramento, 60.1, and
Xapa/57.5. The highest temperatures are: Butte County, 108;
Yuba, 109; Napa, no; Tehama, 108; Sacramento, 102; Santa Clara,
106; Glenn, 105; Yolo, 104; Kern, in; Tulare, no; Fresno, 109.
This covers the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys and the two
bay counties, Napa and Santa Clara. The range, it will be^ ob
served, is only 9 degrees from 102 in Sacramento to in in Kern.
We have not at hand the report on humidity. But as all men of
experience know, the humidity from Kern to Shasta is low, and
when high temperature and low humidity are associated the heat
is endured without suffering.
The defamatory circular associates irrigation .with malaria.
This is untrue. The oldest extensive irrigation is in Fresno and at
Hanford and in Yolo County. Malaria is not endemic there, nor
is it in any part of California. There is sporadic malaria in this
State, as there is everywhere in the world between the Arctic and
Antarctic circles. But malaria and intermittent fever are neither
epidemic nor endemic in any part of California. The dry heat of
the valley of California is one of the elements in its capacity for
production. It is the agent which in association with fertile soil
and irrigation has given to the San Joaquin Valley, from Bakers
field to Stockton, the most varied and valuable production found
in a similar area anywhere in the world. With the extension of
irrigation over the Sacramento Valley the same results will follow
there.
The dry heat, soil and irrigation of the San Joaquin Valley
have located at Fresno the vast raisin production that controls the
American market and is impressing that of Europe. These same
physical conditions have perfected the Smyrna fig at Fresno and
the output is rising every year. The State Board of Trade has on
exhibition at Fresno dates of this year's crop as plump and sugary
as ever ripened in Hadramaut or loaded the palms of Jelajel. At
Porterville, Tulare County, and north to Oroville, in Butte, grow
as fine oranges as ever Sicily produced, and yet this is not all. From
Bakersfield to Shasta the people are as stalwart and sound physi
cally as any on earth. Men, women and children, they may be put
in competition with any, anywhere, ii\ respect to average health,
strength, beauty and intelligence.
If nothing else existed to negative the defamations of this real
estate circular, the great growth of towns like Bakersfield, Tulare,
Visalia, Hanford, Selma, Fowler, Oleander, Fresno, Merced, Mo
desto, Stockton, Sacramento, Marysville and Chico proves that
people find in the great valley not only prosperity, but sanitary
conditions of the best. Fresno especially stands â¢ out in evidence
against the falsifier, for its growth began with irrigation and has
increased with every acre that has been put unde,r water. Twenty
three years ago Fresno was an inconsiderable "cow town," the
feeble product of pastoral conditions. Then came irrigation, and
now it is a little Chicago, with the sharp rattle of a city, its streets
paved, its private residences among the most luxurious in the State,
and its institutions of all kinds up to the altitude of a wholesome
civilization. As for San Joaquin County, its capital, Stockton, is
one of the most important manufacturing centers on the coast.
It makes everything from a wheelbarrow to a combined har
vester. There are made the great traction engines that draw plows
and reapers and the boats and barges that bring the varied products
of the county down to tide water. It is unnecessary to say that
these great activities would not be possible under conditions inim
ical to health.
Sacramento shows a great increase in population, and people
do not go to a place where disease is the rule and health the excep
tion. Some of the greatest business institutions in the State are
located in Sacramento, and the profits of its trade have overflowed
to found business houses all the way from San Francisco to. New
York City. From Sacramento north the tide of settlement, invest
ment and prosperity is rising, and in another generation the great
valley of California from Bakersfield to Shasta will have millions
of wealthy, healthy and happy people living in a region that these
creatures have tried to blast with a lie.
PUNISHING ADULTERATIONS.
WE complain of the restrictive policy of Germany which ex
cludes much of our trade. One excuse for this policy is that
adulteration of food products is practiced to the injury of the
health of the German consumer. It must be admitted, however, that
the German Government does not play favorites in t|ie matter of
adulteration, but severely punishes its own subjects who violatejts
pure food law. Recently a manufacturer of mineral water at Worms
was fined $48 for putting the labels of a natural spring on his arti
ficial product.
If that were done in this country, the siphon trade would get a
jolt that would admonish it. A manufacturer of brandy in Bamberg,
Bavaria, who sold an adulteration as genuine French cognac, was
fined $700, and sentenced to forty-five days in prison. .His agent
an<3 accomplices were sentenced to one and a half and three years'
imprisonment respectively. It will be remembered that when a
former Board of Health in this city sought to prevent the export to
England of no barrels of raw corn highwines, water and drugs
labeled "Pure Old California Grape Brandy," the Health Inspector
was hauled into court and narrowly escaped punishment for trying
to keep the stuff from being sent out. We may learn something
'from Germany.
Genuine California brandy was injured by that export. It
would have been helped by spilling the no barrrels and putting the
men who owned it in jail. No one knows but the same businesses
flourishing here, as the result of immunity which was connived at
by 'public officers. .
This country is so much interested in the export trade that our
jaws should severely protect the purity of our products, and punish
the faise labeler, adulterator and sophisticator. California, is espe
cially interested. Our wines and brandies can never achieve the
market they deserve until their character is above suspicion. "The
pure food agitation flashes up occasionally, but so far little has been
accomplished to effectively pfcrtect our products against the greedy
and reckless adulterator.
Nothing can exceed the masterful way in which the Hon. Albert J. Bev
eridgc holds in his Presidential boom. With a little effort one can almost
delude himself into believing that Mr. Bcveridge is without a boom.â Kansas

A. J. WATERHOUSE
PERCHED on his: barrel throne, the
village sage
1 Discussed the weighty problems of
his age, .
While other sages of a less repute
His words might question, but could ne'er
refute.
Well versed in subtleties of law was he.
Could judge 'twixt Tweedledum and
Tweedledee
And wisely.'Â«ay which Tweedle ought to
win,
For twice a Legislator he had been. ,}
So round him gathered old, and c'en the
young.
To garner wisdom from his gifted tongue;
Heard with regret wherein our nation
erred,
And how it might be saved with rapture
heard,
Saw systems punctured by his ready wit,
Learned how the suns in one vast scheme
were knit.
And wondered still, and wondered ever
more, '' - -
That all his wisdom, he so meekly bore,
For c'en the drowsy flies the grocery
knew
Buzzed one refrain: "Here's loreâ bz-z-xz,
bz-z-zzâ for you."
The while he paused in clarifying law,
Fresh inspiration from his pipe to draw.
At public meetings bright our sachem
shown.
And proud were we to feel he was our
For he could make an introduct'ry speech
That highest flights of eloquence would
reach :
So rare. Indeed, his oratorlc flow
The one he Introduced scarce had a show;
His taper pave a feeble light alone.
For well he knew the brilliant sun had
shone;
While all the llst'nlng rustics whispered
still:
"He may be some, but he ain't hxe our
Bill."
In "nipellng." too, his light shone pure
and clear, \
And his "experience" was a thing to
hear.
No "politician" he without a God;
The sacred aisles in reverence he trod.
With low-bowed head unto the altar
drew \u25a0 \
And worshiped etlll the .One his fathers
knew.
Our wisest he, and yet, c'en as a child,
He pleaded for a love and mercy mild
To guide him in the way proclaimed of
old.
And safely lead him through the gates
of gold. â¢
Our sape of sages, still we heard him cry,
"My Father, lead, for weak and blind
am I."
And when one day he passed the portal
through
I doubt not that his answered prayer
he knew.
A village sagre, whom some might term
; - a clod.
And yet his simple lore held close to
God;
A humble sage of half-forgroten days
From which I fear me that our mad
world strays.
And, Oh! I cry for more such sages
now,
With truth enwrit upon a placid brow,
Who only know to do the simple
right.
And look unto its fount for all their
light!
For those, who know no cunning,
subtle way.
But scorn the cards of life to falsely
play!
The princely men who made our coun
try great; \u25a0 .
Who, lost, we vainly seek our high
estate!
From paths forgotten let them come
again
To teach us truth" and make us better
men,
For still we need, and ever will, I
know, â¢

No one has ever interpreted the West for us as Bret Harte did. and ws
power over our imagination was due less to the qualities of the region he_ ac
scribed, and to reminiscences that hung about it of . the redskin s early glory,
than to the human drama of our own kind which he -showed to us against me

What if the old and sordid farmer finds his horiz on . bounded -by _ his corn

than this, farther even thaw that horizon marked by the meeting of earth and

fact that the. agricultural life is the backbone of the nation.

SAINTS AND HEROES.
JOHN J. HOLDEN
. -
CC |F THERE is so much good In the worst of us." writes an inquirer, and
|go much bad in the best of us. where is: there room" for the hero and
1 the saint?" It sounds a little like a conundrum, but the heroism and
the sanctity certainly lie in the combination of good and evil all man-_
kind has to know, for there can be no sanctity and no heroism without some
enemy, within or without, to withstand and conquer.
It has beert observed more than once that when men esteemed and really
great confide their Inmost thoughts to paper, their editors or literary executors
invariably find pages of self-blame, self-depreciation, self-accusation-even to
the intimation of dreadful sins committed. " , . , Â«
The student of psychology will see here that the nature Implanted In us,
with the ineradicable instincts and passions on which are based all the h opes
of the race, has sometimes fought and obtained temporary victory;- over the
noblest souls the world has known. _ __ . Â£
In a degree this same battle is the one we all have to fight No man is so
eood that he -always triumphs, or so bad he is always defeated.
We know the saints and heroes who lived lons ago. but we do .not
know those, of to-day. Yet I believe they are all about us. and to be found .
in the streets and in railway trains as a matter of da Hy experience. We do
not recSze them, just as truly heroic or saintly Â«Â«Â»"Â«Â«* In, ourselve s do
not-anpeal to us as such-a saint who believed himself a saint, a. hero *ho
"houghrhimself a hero, are contradictions |pe^m^JÂ»feÂ§^PJ
well-if no man is a hero to his valet, and no prophet .^thout honor save
in his own country, be assured that no man is saint or hero to himself.
Mankind for its own encouragement seldom allows- the truth to appear as
a whole Just as editors cut out the self-accusations spoken of In great men s
autobiocraDhies just so-tho saints and heroes of the oast are made to seem
perSct to the iIU of' the impossible; Those who knew them most Inti
mately are seldom permitted to speak. It is only their parade dress, so to
speak, that clothes them ' in their publicly exhibited portraits.
Were the reverse the practice, how many shining figures would the annals
of the world disclose as models and exemplars to their brethren?
Yet there is encouragement for us in the other picture. Men achieve true
greatness in spite of their Imperfections, not because of them, and if they na\e
conquered, so may we. Look for saints and heroes here and novr.

THE PITYING TOUCH.
WALLACE RICE
PROF. N. S/ SHALER In that excellent book of his called "The Neighbor"
calls attention to a curious psychological fact. Noting first that there is
among many men and women of refinement a positive repugnance at
touching the person of one that is sick or suffering, amounting to a dislike
of the sufferer he observes that this repugnance changes to an active and
eager sympathy and desire to be'of service, once the other has been touched
and the relation of personal contact established. '
The accuracy of his observation is based upon universal human experience.
It has found 'its way Into sacred literature everywhere, and Is the basis of
numerous religious rites in many religions. ' .
It is seen In the laying on of hands in confirmation, in anointing with oil in
many other ceremonies, and was exercised even by the kings of England with
in a* few centuries by touching for scrofula. Other Instances will come readily
Two causes have co-operated to prevent Americans from using this pitying
touch except when Intimate relations have already b-3en established. One lies
In that suppression of feeling among the English-speaking peoples which ex
hibits itself chiefly in gesture and similar demonstrations -
Among the Puritans of New England this was earned so far as to avoid
exhibitions of affection through caresses within the limits of one s own family.
With this has grown up the Idea that it is disgraceful, a shock to one's sacred
ness of personality, to touch another or to be touched by another.
It is hardly necessary to say that cause and effect bear so close a relation
in thn manifestation of the human emotions that ; constant suppression of all
exhibitions and outward manifestations of emotion results in time In a suppres
sion, more or less complete,' of the emotions f themselves. -,!.', , v *
Undemonstrative folk/those that uever make any external exhibition of what
passes within their hearts, come to bo as really cold inside as they appear .to
be from without. Consequently those that need the revivifying e^ect of the
pitying touch, both for themselves and other 1, are least likely to learn its
benefits As they shrink from being touched, so they shrink from touching.
The 'lesson would seem to be, for Americans especially, to let -themselves go
far of tener. than they do, if they would have ' that human sympathy which is
of the essence of true humanity and of Christianity.. >

told him what; l wanted, and he replied,

I told him that I would go out with
him. He smiled as he buttoned his faded
overcoat and stepped out.. It was rain

for it was larger than "his, and as we
turned into Forty-second street we ex
changed ' umbrellas. ; He was going, he
said, "Just down the street," to Dr. Pax
ton's Presbyterian Church, to prayer
meeting. At the church door he said,
"Good evening, we part here."
But I,- too, went in to prayer meeting.
When Mr. Sage bowed his head so did I-
The meeting over I rejoined him at the

HARRISON'S HUNTING DOGS.
I recall as vividly as though it had all
happened yesterday a sharp December
morning, when, with a companion of
many a shooting and fishing Jaunt, I fol
lowed "Mose" and "Jan" over the stub
bles of a Southern Illinois farm. We had'
been working the fields for several hours
anil had stopped to rest under a persim
mon tree on the edge of the next field
we were to hunt. "Mose" and "Jan" had
found a close-by ditch and in its water
they had spread themselves, until now
cool and invigorated they lay panting
with an occasional whiff at the hunting
pockets In which were the birds their
services had aided us in killing. After
a brief, rest we were off again. Over a
rail fence we clambered and away went
the dogs at a lively gait. Suddenly "Jan"
threw his head to one side, wheeled in
the air and came down tense and drawn;
with nose uplifted and quivering and
pointed Into the wind, with body motion
less, with tail stretched stiff and rigid.
"Moss," twenty yards away, straightened
out, and, feeling his way as tenderly as
If he" 'were -walking on up-point needles,
the good old dog took a step towara
"Jan," then paused, then another step,
then another, pause, and so, until a few
feet behind him, he came to a dead halt.
There the two dogs stood without a
quiver of a muscle or the batting of an
eyelid until their masters went in, flushed
the game and bade them search for dead
birds.
Sculpture has been described as frozen
music. What shall we call the picture
of grace and beauty made by a pair or
good dogs which have found the game
and present" It to their masters ?â Carter

BISHOP AND THE WAFFLES.
It would indeed be a queer Bishop
who could not tell a good story on him
self. The late Bishop Dudley of Ken
tucky was wont to relate with much
relish an interesting experience which
he once had In connection with waffles.
\u25a0 At "a "fine old Virginia homestead
where he~~was a frequent guest the
waffles were always remarkably good.
One morning, as breakfast drew near
an end, the tidy little linen-coated -1 black
hoy who served a.t table approached
Bishop Dudley anas asked in a low
voice: ; â¢
"Bishop, won't y* have 'n'er waffles?"
"Yes," said the genial Bishop, "I be
lieve I wi11.".,
"Dey aln*:no mo'," then said the nice
little black boy. : -
."Well."; exclaimed thÂ« surprised rev
erend gentleman, "if there aren't any
more waffles, what made you ask me
if I wanted 'another oner"
"Bishop." explained the little black
boy, "you'a done et ten a'ready, an' I
fought you wouldn't want no mo."â

A lADY LECTURER
Feeds Nerves and Brain Scientifically.
. A lady lecturer writes from Philadel-
phia concerning: the use of right food
and how she Is enabled to withstand
the strain and wear and tear of her
arduous occupation. She aays:
"Through Improper food, imperfectly di-
gested, my health was completely
wrecked and I attribute my recovery en-
tirely to the regular use of Orape-Nuts
food. It has*. I assure you, proved an in-
estimable boon to me.
"Almost immediately after beginnin? He
use I found a gratifying change in my
k condition. The terrible weakmss that
formerly prostrated me after a few hours
of work wa*. perceptibly lessened by a
few days' use of Grape-Xuts and is now
only a memoryâ it never returns.
"Ten days after beginning it I experi-
enced a wonderful increase in mental
vigo* and physical energy, and continued
use has entirely freed me from the mis-
erable insomnia and nervousness from
which I used to suffer so much.
"I find Grape-Nuts very palatable and
Ijpould not be without the crisp, delicious
*Kjd for even a day on any considera-
tion. Indeed. I always carry it with me
en my lecture tour*."

FAMOUS WESTERN BEAUTY
IS MARRIED IN PARIS.
MISS EfllLY STUART TfIYLOR FLIGHTS
TROTH TO ERNEST A. VILTSEE. _
MRS. ERNEST A. WILTSEE. A SAN FRANCISCO GIRL, VvHO WA9 WEDDED
IX PARIS YESTERDAT TO A WELL-KNOWN CLUBMAN. MRS. WILTSEE
HAS SET PARIS AFLAME WITH HER BEAUTT.
The American colony In Paris Is asrog
over the wedding; of Miss Emily Stuart
Taylor and Ernest A. Wiltsee that was
celebrated Jn fit fashion yesterday, and
while the 6ervlce was simple and the
guest-list limited, the accoutrements of
the affair were in keeping with the ex
travagant beauty of the bride and the
esthetic taste of the groomâ likewise com
mensurate with his wealth.
The bride spent her childhood In San
Francisco, leaving the West to complete
her education in .the convents of Paris
and of Switzerland, where she acquired
a happy acquaintance with the polite lan
guages and with the graces of the gay
Pariciennes. ;â¢\u25a0"
Though a beauty as a child. It was not
until she had reached womanhood that
the full splendor of her beauty wafc mani
fest Then all Paris fell to worshiping
the American divinity, aB she was called,
the artists and photographers vying with
one another for sittings.
Her debut was mads In Gotham a few
years ago, under the chaperonage of her
aunt, Mrs. Pierre Lorillard Sr., when the
debutante waa the motif for a splendid
ball. Thereafter she was entertained
by many of the Newjportset and by the
Astor family, but her heart yearned for
dear old Paris, where she has since made
her home.
It was while on a visit to New York
that Ernest Wiltsee met her. Always a
worshiper of, beautyâ for note his devo
tion to Mrs. Hart McKee and divers not
ed stage beautiesâ he became her ardent
devotee, following; her to Paris.
Ratber good looking, of seductive voice
and persuasive personality, and possessed
of a bunch of sold mines and a few acres
of diamond fields, he grained the affection
of the petted American maid, and won
her hand againet a strong field.
Many of Mr. Wiltaee'g local club friends
had cabled their congratulations, which
were read at the supper that followed the
wedding servicesâ for there are two In
Paris, the civil and the religious. ,
It is Â«aid that Mr. Wiltsee and his dash
iryj bride will visit New York during the
winter. If they do, It might occur to. the
pair to wander out to San Francisco,
where a cordial reception would ' greet
them.

A. Sutcllff is a civilian attached to
the quartermaster's department of tho
army and for the last seven years has
been stationed in ftanila. He arrived
here yesterday on the transport Sher
man, home on a vacation. At Honolulu
there. is a chauffeur ' who believes that
Sutcllff Is' a multi-millionaire. It all
comes of Sutcllff having been away
from America so long that he lost the
ability to distinguish between the
golden eagle and the double eagle.
At Honolulu Sutcllff chartered an au
tomobile and gave it a busy time. The
ride ended, he told the chauffeur to
cotne aboard the Sherman and get his
money.
The chauffeur went ashore and told
the Honolulu newspaper men that he
bad presented to Sutcllff a bill for* $18
and that Sutcliff had extracted three
$20 gold pieces frotn a well-filled bag,
handed the golden tokens to the chaui
feur and told him to keep the change.
And so it was written in the Honolulu
papers. : i \u25a0 .'.
Sutcliff was shown a copy of one of
the papers yesterday and when he re
turns to Honolulu will, look up that
chauffeur, and make him disgorge sev
eral dollars. .. .~'.\ Z t
Eutnllff says the chauffeur, presented
a bill for $27 50. not for $18. The man
had "been very, obliging and Sutcllft
handed him what:' he thought at the
time were three $10 gold pieces, tell
ing him to keep the change.
He discovered his mistake later and
would have made 'no . kick had the
chauffeur told the truth about his bill.

Smart denies that he placed any formal
dehyde in his milk, leaving the; inference
that if any were found In it, it was placed
there after it left his dairy. \u25a0
The Health Board yesterday . detailed
Inspector Brady to make a thorough in
spection of Smart's dairy. Brady ; re
ported that he had been unable to find
any boxes containing formaldehyde or
preservatives of any kind on Smart's
premises. Health Officer Ragan : resents
the charge that the Health Department
has been negligent in the matter of food
inspection. Ragan issued the following
statement: .
"The serlouÃ Illness of the Lent chil
dren, duo to the drinking of the milk al
leged to be preserved with formaldehyde.
Is a matter to be regretted; but the at
tempt to charge any part in the unfortu
nate affair to the negligence of the
Board of Health demands a public ex
planation,
"The Board of Health does not rise to
the action of the accused dairy
raan,,';but In common justice it desires
to state that repeated analyses of the
milk taken from Mr. Smart's dairy or
his various delivery wagons shows all
these samples to be free from preserva
tives. These samples are gathered by
our milk inspectors, then brought to our
chemical laboratory for analyses, and
when this report Is submitted to the
Health Office executive action against of
fenders is instituted. In the particular
case, of Mr. Lent's . milk the Board of
Health could take no official action for
the very evident reason that its officers
and inspectors could not be a party to
the prosecution of this suit. The only
investigation open for the Board of
Health to pursue in this matter was an
inspection of the records of. the analyses
of milk coming from the dairy of Mr.
Wnart. This was done. An examination
of the dairy premises of Mr. Smart was
ordered made and everything in the
shape of fluids or solids, such as soap,
powders, etc., used in the cleansing of
cans, were ordered brought to the chem
ical laboratory for the purpose of deter
mining if any of these cleansing mate
rials showed the presence of formalde
hyde. The chemist's report has not yet
been submitted.
"During our supervision we have found
many cases In which preservatives were
found in the milk and in which the milk
waa otherwise adulterated or Impure,
and in every Instance the violator of this
milk ordinance' has been summoned to
the bar of Justice. Not only have we
caused the arrest of these offenders, but
we have published upon our bulletin
boards and in our^monthly^ medical bulle
tin a list of those dairymen and other
handlers of milk who have violated the
present regulation. Our examinations of
milk average about 200 samples monthly,
and this is the full measure of work that
we can exact from our chemical labora
tory with Its present force. The Board
of -Health deslrea to extend this charac
ter of work and asked for an increased
appropriation of money to be expended
in this line, but that request was not met
with the desired appropriation."

OF AMERICA
President of Manila's^^ Muni
cipal Board Thrashed by
a Former Eough Eider
HEBEEEA APOLOGIZES
Prominent Filipino, While
Entertaining â¢ Taf t Party,
Assails His Fair. Guests
The army people who arrived yesterday
on the transport Sheridan bring - from
Manila a hitherto unpublished . story of
the visit of the Taf t party to Manila.
The hero . is \u25a0 Captain George Curry, for
merly one of Roosevelt's Rough Riders,
now Governor of Samar. . The villain is
Cruz . Herrera, President of Manila's
Municipal Board.
Herrera gave a banquet at hla house in
honor of the distinguished visitors. Sec
retary of War Taft was there, Miss Alice
Roosevelt and the majority of those who
made up the Secretary's party. Every
thing went along beautifully until the
toast stage was reached. The host is
said to have paid liberal attention . to his
wine glass, and by. the time it ca&ne for
him to propose a toast he was laboring
under the handicap of a' large-sized Jag. -
| To the astonishment of his guests Her
rera's eloquence took the form of an ap
parently studied insult to the women of
America. He did not get very far when
Captain George Curry, In the words of
an officer who returned on the Sherman,
"pasted him in the face with a glass
of champagne," Curry threw glass and
allâ and would have followed his act of
protest by further physical demonstra
tion but for the' Interference of other
guests. ; -
That ended the banquet, but Captain
Curry was not satisfied. A little later,
it is said, he saw Herrera riding in his
carriage. Curry ordered the coachman
to stop. He then pulled Herrera out of
the rig and. the Governor of Samar gave
the President of the Municipal Board
a thrashing which for vigorous complete
ness is said to rank with what Togo did
to the Russian fleet.
When : Herrera recovered he is said to
have .waited on Governor General Wright
and tendered an abject apology for what
he said about American women. He said
he was drunk and not responsible for his
words. Wright is said to have informed
him that officially he supposed he would
have to accept the -apology, but that as a
man he could do nothing of the kind,
as he believed that drunken men and
Children spoke their true thoughts, and
he, Wright, could have nothing but con
tempt for the man whose .mind pic
tured the women of America as Her
rera had spoken of them.
Herrera later was given an Indefinite
leave of absence. - \u25a0â¢
As official evidence that he had been
forgiven Heirera then invited Miss RooÂ«e
velt and some of her friends to pay an
other visit to his house and Secretary
Taft Is said to have raised a storm of
indignation by insisting that the invita
tion be accepted.

PHILADELPHIA. Oct. IS.â Tommy
Murphy of New York was badly beaten
by Terry McGovern to-night at the Na
tional Athletic Club. It took 'McGovern
only two minute? and two seconds to
gain the victory. Murphy was so helpless
before the blows of the former champion
that the referee stepped in and saved
Murphy from probable serious injury. The
defeated man was frame to the end. Mc-
Govern showed his old-time form. fight-
Ing hard and fast from the sound of the
gong-
McGovern opened the round, swinging
hard to Murphy's face and neck. He
followed this with a hard blow to the
body and then to the ear before Murphy
could land. After that it was all Mc-
Govern. He landed at will. . Murphy be
gan mixing 1 it up and got the worst of it.
He was knocked down six times, and
each time he came to his feet he would
ftagger.
McGovern stood over him and struck
blow after blow. Finally Murphy be
came defenseless and the referee stepped
in and ended the uneven contest. Mur
phy was carried to his corner in an al
most unconscious condition.
The clubhouse was so crowded that
hundreds of persons were turned away.
Announcement was made that McGovern
and Corbett had agreed to meet in a six
round bout at the club in a short time.

â¢openings.
The second and third rounds of the
Futurity stake were run to-day by win
ners in the first round, which was made
yesterday.
The continued cold and cloudy
v.f ather did not discourage the 2000
people who were In attendance to-day,
though It made the racing more diffi
cult. There . was some fine coursing
and no breaks. v- \u25a0.,'..;"
The betting was heavy on the dogs
making the second round. The Interest
In this round of thirty-six braces was
particularly centered in fipllt-a-Bottle,

paired with The Harvest Hand, owned
by A. G. Home of Selden, Kans., which
he won by a score of 8 to 0.

DENVER, Colo., Oct. 18.â Jimmy Brltt
posted to-day with Otto Floto, a sporting
writer, a check for JlOOO as a "forfeit for
a return fight with Battling Nelson. Britt
said:
"I will let him name the terms. He
can select the referee. He can name the
amount of the side bet. He can name the
number of rounds. In short, it's up to him.
I have not failed to give Nelson credit for
his. victory. over.me. .Not that I think he
is the better man, but because he won
and to the'victor goes the spoils. \ .
"I don't want, to offer any excuse, but
any one who sees the pictures will dis
cern that I happened to be . in a corner
against the ropes, when the fatal blow
was delivered. You will see Nelson with
his head down, having no more idea
where his blow is going to land than he
has of flying. .
"He happened to .land. He has been
proclaiming that I was afraid to meet
him. I am going further with him than
I ever went. in negotiating with an op
ponent before and . think it no egotism
when I say that as a matchmaker I at
least am entitled to'some recognition."

If the Commuters do not wade in pret
ty strong right away and play some
baseball the Angels will be the head
liners in the chase after the Hag. By ;
the defeat of Oakland yesterday Loa !
Angeles climbed right up near the top i
seat of the bandw agon, and now Oak-,j
land has a lead of only- a couple of
points. Bad baseball is doing this and
unless something comes to pass in
hurry-up time Oakland is liable to hit
that old toboggan soon and land down
in the cellar.
In the meanwhile the Slwashesare
doing a bit of nice work each day.
They played some yesterday and, with
Shields pitching his usual bright game,
victory came easily in the last two in
nings. Oakland led up to that time,
but as soon as Seattle began to show
signs of coming through the Commut
ers, as usual, got busy and quit.
After making a good start, Oakland
stood still for the balance of the game.
Van Haitren ushered in the first inning
by beating out -a bunt, and Streib's er
ror of Dunleavy's souse sent him
around to third. Moskiman whished
out a grounder and while he was being
retired old Van slid safely in .with the
only run Oakland was able to negoti
ate.
Blexrud, the lowa busher, was there
till the seventh, when the Siwashes
managed to squeeze a run over on him.
Blankenship singled and Strelb bunted
him along the route. Lauterborn hit,
and when Dunleavy booted the ball
Blankenship took advantage of the
misplay and hotfooted till he arrived
with the run that tied it up.
But the deadlock remained only for
this one inning.' Seattle came right
back in the eighth and sent a delega
tion of two over in jig time. Bennett
straightened out one of Mr. Blexrud's
corncobs and Kane swung on a fast one
that made a noise like a two-base hit.
Bennett easily came .through on this
wallop. After this there was nothing to
It. Kelly and Devereaux quickly fumbled
the next two that came along and Kane
arrived in a twinkling, : making
score 3 to 1, the way It stood when fin
ishing time was at hand. The score:

Sam Spalding, the "Michigan Giant"

this afternoon when he dons the mitts

is a veritable giant and 3ays he can
go, and if he makes any kind of a
showing In his tryout. Bishop will
probably try to round him out into a
star of the arena.

THINKS' SHRIMP LAW

Judo'e Lawlor Disappoints
Chinese .Merchants and
Fishermen;
Tho law forbidding the exportation
of shrimps to -China was held consti
tutional by Judge Lawlor yesterday.
The attorneys' for the Chinese are
making a hard flght to have the meas
ure declared Invalid and will undoubt
edly appeal to the higher courts.
The present law was framed a,t the
solicitation of the Fish Commission to
check the immense shipments of dried
shrimps to China. The Mongolians
trusted that their lawyers would se
cure a decision invalidating the pro
vision and with that end in view they
have sacked and ,stored thousands of
pounds of the little crustaceans.
A suit Instituted in behalf of the
yellow men in the Federal courts
proved vain. Executive Officer Vogel
sang: of the Fish Commission says sur
reptitious shipments of shrimps In any
quantity cannot be made without de
tection and that Mn consequence the
Chinese will suffer heavy losses.

SAY HE ALTERED
RAILROAD PASS
Southern Pacific Officials Ac
cuse Michael J. Welch of
Tampering With Ticket
RELEASED ON BAIL
Judge Cabariiss Fixes Bail
at $2000, Which Is I'ur
nished by the Arrested Man
Michael J. Welch was arrested yester
day on complaint of Detective Ed Gib
son and at the instigation of the South
ern Pacific Company, on a charge
of altering and , putting Into cir
culation a railroad pass. Later -in the
day he was released on $2000 bail, which
amount was fixed by Judge Cabanlss.
Officials of the Southern Pacific Bail
road allege that early In August they
issued a, pass to E. L.. Taylor, a tele
graph operator connected with their
company, which pass would enable Tay
lor to travel from here to Tucson. Ariz.
It is claimed by the railroad ; company
that Taylor disposed of this' pass to
Welch. Welch In turn resold the pass
to J. M. Peters for $15. If WeJch had
sold the pass, as it was originally is
sued, all might now be well and good.
The pass was originally made to expire
August 15. But Welch is accused by the
company of having altered, this date to
August Zl.
It is claimed by the company that
Welch raised the figures 15 by means of
acids, and inserted the figures 31 in their
place. It Is also alleged by the railroad
company that Welch erased. the name of
E. L.. Taylor on the back of the pass
and permitted Peters to rewrite the
name of Taylor thereon, so it would be
in Peters* handwriting. After Peters
procured the ticket, he proceeded as far
as Log Angeles, traveling under the
name of E. L. Taylor. At that place he
was held up by the train agent, who took
the pass away from him, as he discov
ered that an alteration had been made.
Peters then returned to town, and laid
his statement of the facts before, the
railroad company, with the result that
Welch was arrested.
SECRET SERVICE MEN
BOARD THE SHERMAN
Four Bakers and a Sailor
Suspected of Counter
feiting.
Four bakers, J. Holden, "Sack" Bern
hardt, August Vollmer and John; Shea,
and one seaman, John Duffy,. : were
taken off the Government transport
Sherman yes-terday by, United States
Secret Service Agent George .W. Hazen,
Harry IV. Moffltt and Thomas B. Fos
ter. -They were placed in the City
Prison awaiting the action of the Fed
eral authorities with reference to the
connection of the prisoners with ithe
recent issue of counterfeit bank- notes
in Nagasaki, Japan. Captain Hazen
took the prisoners to his office in the
PostorSce building and required them
to make statements of .their connection
with the affair, bnea admitted that he
had passed six 'counterfeit bills of the
denomination of $10 each in Nagasaki.
He said they were such poor counter
feits thai he would not attempt to pass
any of them in the United States. The
picture of George. Washington on one
issue of the bills, he -said, was so poor
that "Washington's head was hardly
recognizable from that of the Mikado.
Duffy Is suspected of. having been im
plicated with Shea in passing; the bills,
but he refused to make any admis
sions.
The arrests were made upon a cable
message of United. States Marshal E.
K. Hendry of Honolulu to Chief Wllkie
of the United States Secret Service at
Washington informing him that ten
and .twenty dollars counterfeit bills of
the First National Bank of Mariana.'
Florida, the Western National Bank

VICTIMS OF GAS

-Two men who , had breathed deadly
gas during the night were found In bed
In a room In the lodging-house at 322
Third street yesterday morning. One
was dead and the other was in an un
conscious: condition. Gas was escaping
from an open Jet. ,The dead body was
taken to the Morgue and the uncon
scious mart, was sent to the Central
Emergency. Hospital. He may recover,
but' the chances are said to be against
him. :.--.,'
â¢ The two men called at the lodging
house about 9:30 o'clock on Tuesday
night and engaged a. room from the
nigju; clerk. . O. R. Leurance. who oc
cupied an. adjoining room, thought he
detected" the ' odor of gas about 11
o'clock, but, thinking it was nothing
unusual, went to sleep without making
an investigation.
Shortly after 9 o'clock yesterday
morning U. A. Delort. the landlord, was
attracted by the odor of gas u> the
room occupied by the two men. The
door was locked, but he effected an en
trance through the window. The room
was full of gas, which was escaping
from ap open jet. Both men were In
bed. One was dead and the other un
conscious. Delort notified the Coroner's
office and the police.
The men seemed to be miners. Their
names are probably established by ef
fects found on them. In the pockets of
the dead man was found a knife with
the name and address of "M. Perusich,
Chisholm, Minn.," engraved upon the
handle. In the pockets of the uncon
scious man were naturalization papers
issued in the District Court of St. Louis
County, Minn., to John Slaney on July
2S, 1904.
It Is supposed that the men had acci
dentally turned on the gas after turn
ing It off when "retiring, as there is
nothing to point to suicide.
Serlona Chare* Asalnst Old Man.
J. W. Henderson, a shoemaker at 603
Geary street, 60 years of age, was
booked at the City Prison yesterday by
Acting Captain Â£ Reynolds and Detec
tive Ed Gibson on. a charge of attempt
to commit a criminal assault upon
Margaret Webb, 8 years of age, living
at 575 Geary street. The girl says that
the defendant attempted to assault her
on three different occasions within the
past two months, ln a rear room of his
shop. He gave her money Ho buy
candy. Other children at the Clement
Grammar School, which Margaret at
tended, would not speak to her, which
led their teacher to make an inves
tigation and the police were notified.
Henderson denies the charge.

REFUSES TO PREVENT
ARREST OF SCALPER
Judge Hunt ' Holil-m That Outside
Dealer* In Tlienter TlckcÂ«:.i Have
No Eqnltablc Remedy.
Judge Hunt handed down- an opinion
yesterday denying the petition of R.
P. Quarg for an injunction restrain
ing the police from interfering with
or arresting him while he is engaged
In the conduct of his business as a
theater .ticket . scalper. The police
acted against him under the recent act
passed by the Legislature making it
a misdemeanor for any person to offer
for sale any theater ticket at "a price
in excess of tha.t charged by the man
agement thereof.
Quarg demanded the injunction on
the ground that the statute Is unconsti
tutional. Judge Hunt holds, however.
tha.t the court has no authority to de
termine the constitutionality of the act
In a proceeding in equity and that the
court has no authority to Issue an in
junction to prevent one's anticipated
arrest for the violation of a nenal
statute. "
The court further holds that the
only way the constitutionality of the
act can be tested Is for the plaintiff to
submit to arrest and determine thÂ«
question In the criminal proceedings
a&alnat him.
Ready to Begin Contest.
The hearing of the contest of the
will of the late Mrs. Bertha Elling
house will begin before Judge Coffey
at 11 o'clock this morning. With the
exception of $50 to her daughter. Mrs.
Emma M. Stone, and a like sum ,to her
son, Edward C. Ellinghouse. the testa
trix left her estate, valued at more
than $10,000, to her son, Oscar. â¢It
is alleged by the contestants that aut
the time she executed the will Mrs.
Elllnghouse was suffering from senil
ity and was unduly Influenced by the
residuary legatee. The contestants are
represented by Attorneys . Louis P.
Boardman and Samuel M. Shortrldge
and the proponent by Attorney Andrew
Thome.

ket opened 7<gtlO up, which proved to be the
lowest of the session. Miss Giles' report was
very bullish, but the local bears all ignored the
report by selling heavily, with the view to
bring about liquidation, but the buying was
first class, and the market ran qp easily some
20 points. Mr. Price was sending around his
. most bearish literature, but It had no effect
on the market. The reports from the gins
show that the cotton is not coming In as last
as expected In the northern and central por
tions of the Western belt. Farmers â¢ seem,
more Inclined to hold, "and it Is a growing be
lief that the large receipts recently represent
cottcn that was sold higher up.
Mlus Giles figures the crop at 10,300,000
bales, and gives the condition at 67, against
72.5 last year.

Hay and Feedstnffs.
Rolled 'Barley rules strong In sympathy with
the rising raw grain. Bran and Middlings are
also firm, with light offerings. There is more
demand for/ the lower grades of Hay and,
while there is no change in the range
of the market, '.some of these lower, grades are
bringing about $1 per ton more than they did
a week or - ten days ago. ' The circular of
Somers & Co. says: â¢ â¢ > -
"Total receipts of Hay for the week just
ended amount to 2750 tons, or 400 more than
for the week preceding. Shipments were con
siderably augmented by Monday's arrivals of
56 cars, the heaviest shipments by rail for two
or three weeks. This would seem to indicate
that the car scarcity has been relieved some
what, but an investigation â¢ discloses the fact
that there was ! an accumulation of Friday's
and Saturday's shipments, which resulted in
this large number of cars for Monday. . . - .; '
"The situation is unchanged in every way,
for the demand for choice grade goods con
tinues for retail purposes and a rather Black
demand for the medium grades. The range
of prices is probably the greatest that we have
experienced for several - years, being practi
cally from $5 50 to $16 50, although there la
hardly one car out of a hundred that will bring
the latter figure. , \u25a0 '
"Future prospects are unchanged, although
if we do not have rain soon there will be a
certain uneasiness, which may result in .an
active demand and higher prices for all grades
of Hay. '-To sum up, however, we have simply
to state that the market will be regulated by
daily arrivals, which in turn will depend on
the supply of cars afforded by the Southern
Pacific Company."

Poultry, and Game.
A car of Western Poultry came In to a
leading retail firm and another car was re
ported close at hand for the wholesale market.
Receipts from domestic i shipping points . .were
liberal and the market was easier in tone,
fancy youngr stock alone showing any firmness.
Small, scrubby Hens were very weak. Arri

and all kinds of Wild Ducks, except Canvas

Batter, Cheese and Eggs.
Firmness continued to characterize all three
descriptions yesterday. \u25a0 choice lots being well
Cleaned up. \u25a0 Eggs -were' still higher, with a
sharp decrease In receipts, but there was no
further advance In Butter and Cheese. Dairy
Butter has a wider range and Is being affected
by the competition of Bastern and cold storage
goods.

Deciduous and -Citrus Fruits.
"/Local trade In fresh fruits was of average
proportions and choice Berries 'and most kinds
ot orchard | fruits ruled firm at stiff prices,
â¢while Melons and Grapes were easy at lower
rates. The cool weather operated against
trade in Melons and a good portion of the day's
arrivals were stlllr.uncared for at the -close.
Receipts of ! small packages of table Grapes
were lighter , than uaual, - but -\u25a0' there was a
heavy carry-over *on hand \u25a0 and \u25a0 prices i ranged
lower, ; there? being no demand ' for \u25a0 shipment.
Large boxes were In good ' supply and weak,
except for fancy. Muscat.- Receipts .of Wine
Grapes consisted of small lots of' poor quality
stock, which met with clow sale at irregular
rates. - The ' second crop has been pretty well
gathered .in all sections. The Apple market
remained weak, with supplies far in excess of
the demand.' ThÂ« f situation |in Citrus -fruits
was unchanged, â¢ choice Valencia and interme
diate- crop. Navel Oranges being firm, while
Lemons and Limes were weak. The Java
Seedling Oranges received from Jamaica : some
days ago are meeting with very slow sale, the
fruit being too green to attract buyers. Ba

The latest mail advices from New York say:
"Quiet - conditions Drevail In I the market for
coast Dried Fruits. Buyers have a good deal
of stock due them on contracts for early ship
ment and are disinclined at present to enter
Into further engagements, especially as price*
are on an unusually high basis: Holders .on
the coast are not disposed to make concessions,
as, according- to all accounts, their unsold
etock is smaller than It has been for many
years at this period. The only article on the
list of California products in- which more than
passing interest U manifested at present is
Raisins." â¢â¢"< â:-\u25a0 r vtsÂ»feÂ»3 ' **â¢ ~
A rather better" demand Tor Honey Is re
ported. Most of the comb * now arriving Is
amber and light amber, and strictly choice
\u25a0white would bring' somewhat over the quota

and -the crop In that State Is reported smaller

REFUSE TO CHANGE
KIND OF PAVEMENT
Supervisors Want the Works
Board to Use Asphalt on
Van Ness Avenue.
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday refused 'to comply .with' the
request of .the . Boarfl of Works " that
the resolution orderirig.Jtbe'repaving of
the four macadamized blocks on Van
Ness avenue with asphalt and to
adopt a new resolution substituting bi
tumen as the pavement. The commit
tee held that asphalt is a superior
pavement and ordered a resolution
drawn up calling attention of the
Mayor to the fact that the work has
been ordered and no action has been
taken as yet by the Works Board.
The latter body raises the point that
no contractor will bid for the work
because It has recommended the bi
tumimzing of the blocks and the Su
pervisors have exceeded their author
ity in ordering asphalt instead. The
Mayor is asked to use his good offices
to Induce the Works Board to have
<thÂ« work done.
A committee from the Teamsters'
Union appeared before the street com
mittee to protest against the action of
Â£he Finance committee cutting down
by ten per cent the wages of twelve
teamsters employed by A. B. Clute, who
has the contract for sweeping . the
streets. The teamsters raised the point
tha* the action of the Finance Com
mittee had not been approved by the
full beard of Supervisors, but it was
explained that such was not the cus
tom. As the street committee had
signed the demands for the full
amount and was not a party to the
reduction ordered by the Finance Com
mittee, the matter was referred again
to the latter body.
The committee decided to take up
thÂ» proposed ordinance limiting the
speed of street cars on next Wednes
day afternoon when the paving of Mis
sion street between Fifth and Xlnth
streets will be considered.
W. P. Fuuler & Co. was granted a
permit to lay a spur track on Front
and Commerce streets.
The committee granted a permit to
Dyer Brothers for a spur track on
Slx.te.enth and Rhode Island streets to
connect with the Santa Fe Railway
system.

MILITARY CEREMONIES
ATTEND FUNERAL
Son of Colonel Tucker Is
Mourned by Army iii
' -'Manila.
Lieutenant Colonel W. F. Tucker and
Mas^ Tucker .were among the passen
gers, on. the steamship Sherman, which
arrived . yesterday- from Manila. They
brought home the body of their son,
George, who died suddenly In Manila
of appendicitis. Colonel Tucker is
chief paymaster of the Philippines divi
sion. Mrs. Tucker is the daughter of
the late General John A. Logan.
The Tuckers have beSn stationed in
Manila for the last eighteen months.
While there young George, who was 12
years of age, made himself a great fa
vorite, not only with the officers at that
post, but also with the .troops. He. was
a very bright lad, inheriting a great
deal of his grandfather's fearless quali
ties.
Out of respect to him and to the
esteem in which his parents and his
"illustrious â¢-\u0084 grandparent are held the
boy % was -accorded a funeral attended
with military ceremonies. From- the
house in which the body lay in Manila
to the transport Sherman followed a
long concourse of army people, soldiers
and friends of the family. The coffin
was enveloped in a beautiful American
flag and covered with a wealth of floral
offerings. Colonel and Mrs. Tucker are
now at the â¢ Palace, and with the re
mains of their son will leave for the
East this morning. The remains will
be placed in the Logan tomb, beside
those of his grandfather.

ated Colleges. All the streets have been
bituminized. Purchasers are offered
terms of one-fifth cash. Many new im
provements are going up on adjoining
property, and. the building up of the
block will make an important change
in the appearance of this section.
Sheriff Xot Entitled to Fees.
City Attorney Long' yesterday ad
vised' the Supervisors' Finance Com
mittee that so much of ,the claim of
the State for $44 for expenses Incurred
in transporting Victor Blank to the
Mendocino Hospital should be paid as
it does not include "Sheriff's fees."
Long says the latter part of the claim
should be rejected because the charter
provides that salaries of municipal of
ficers shall be in full compensation
for all services rendered and all fees
received by them must be turned over
to the city, treasury within twenty
four hours.

It was the :bridg-eroom,- with the bride
acquiescing, who engaged K. /-Teto to
photograph the. wedding, party as It sat
at table In the housed on Pine streot, be
tween Kaarny and Dupont, wherein the
happy couple were to honeymoon.
"For to my mind has come the
thought," said the Intending benedict,
"that our many cousins In Japan would
pleasure take from seeing us surrounded
by our most honorable guests. Therefore,
oh, K. Veto, your ingenious Instrument
bring and portray us as we sit."
Thus instructed, K. Veto took his cam
era, with flashlight attachment, to the
bridal feast. Requesting all those pres
ent to* look as if. they were very happy,
which' request they obeyed by smiling
mirthlessly and staring straight ahead,
he obtained his focus and then prepared
to flash.
Now, among those who had never close
ly Inspected the mechanism of a flash-pan
was one Y. Suglyama, and his Japanese
curiosity prompted him to take advan-
tage of the opportunity there afforded.
His face was rather close to "the powder
laden pan when the match was applied,
and the resultant explosion startled him
so that he involuntarily soared until the
celling stopped his flight and he returned,
a disheveled bundle, to the floor.. When
he regained his feet his ears were as
sailed by shrieks; of laughter from the
spectators, - and imagining that, he had
been made the victim of a trick, operated
by K. Veto, he promptly delivered a
blow that felled that gentleman and up
set the tripod bearing the camera. Pick
ing up his paraphernalia, K. Veto swijng
it against the abdomen of Y. Sugiyama
and then fled, but Y. Sugiyama pursued
him even to his own abode, on Quincy
place, and there belabored him soundly
with flsts and feet. .
That was how both K." Veto and Y. Su
giyama came to be arraigned before Po
lice Judge Conlan on the charge of peace
disturbance. Patrolman -J. J. Farrell
pressed home the complaint, but when K.
Veto told his side of the story the Judge
continued the hearing till this morning,
when the wedding party will be individ
ually permitted to tell Just how it hap
pened. â¢; â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0 . .

I- Accused of having cruelly treated a
horse belonging to M. J. Dalton of 2913
Twenty-fourth street, Bert Reed, aged 17
years, pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Dalton testified that on last Satur
day he lent his horse and buggy to Mas
ter Reed, who desired to ride to Pleasan
ton and promised to take good care of the
rig and return it to its owner not ] later
than noon the following day. That prom
ise was broken, however, for not until
Sunday evening were the horse and. buggy
restored to the Dalton barn, and when
Mr. Dalton examined the animal he found
that one of its legs was out of commission
and it displayed evidences of having been
Inhumanely whipped.
Master Reed pleaded in defense (1) that
as he lost his whip while crossing the
bay he could not possibly have lashed the
horse, (2) that he returned the rig to its
owner "in plenty of time," (3) that when
placed in the stable the horse was sound
of limb and wind, (4) that the horse never
was any good, anyway, and <$) that the
horse's back was galled \u25a0 and plastered
with axle grease, which had soiled the'
hands and clothing of the defendant.
Mr. Dalton acknowledged the axle
grease, but denied that the horse" a'-back
was badly galled or that it was no good,
anyway, despite the fact 'that he pur
chased it for $33 and spent $50 for Its
necessary repair.
Judge Mogan will hear more about it
next Saturday. . .
â¢ * *
John J. Lynch and his wife, Mary, told
Judge Mogan that they had lived up to
the anti-race-suicide doctrine advocated
by President Roosevelt and found It
wanting. Five children, the youngest of
whom is an eight months' old babe, were
discovered in an awful condition of fam
ine and filth at the Lynch residency, 120S
Fifth avenue $outh, and inquiry \u25a0 led to
the disclosure that they, were absolutely
neglected by their parents, who spent for
drink all the money that the man earned.
Had it not been for the benevolence of
neighbors the little ones would have
starved to death while the father and
mother, caroused. The California So
cfety for the Prevention of Cruelty -to
Children was notified of the case, arid
Officer Whiteâ whose description^ of the
condition in whiph he found the young
sters was most shockingâ took care of
the helpless ones and arrested the par
ents.
"How could you treat your children in
such a heartless manner?" the Judge
asked the father, a besotted-looking fel
low.
"They came too fast for a poor man
to provide for thorn all," was the re
ply, "and I got into - det>V and became
discouraged."
"I would wager that you paid cash
for the liquor that you and their un
natural mother have drunk," said his
Honor.
Officer White stated that about a year
ago the I.ynchen were arrested, by him
and similarly charged, but they ob
tained release by promising to eschew
tippling. That pledge they had never
kept {'
"'Well, they shall not be afforded op
portunity to break another one," said
the court. "You are found gullty,"'4ie
added, addressing the defendants, "and
you can accept your' sentence now or
wait until' to-morrow for it."
"I guess we'll wait 'till to T morrow,"
responded the , slatternly woman, with
an Impudent leer, "beqause you may; be
In better humor then."
"Take them away." Bald the Judge
in dissust, nnd the bailiff promptly
obeyed. \u25a0 â¢ '
The S. P. C. C. which institution, it
may not be amiss to state, is faithful
ly living up to its title,; will provide
homes for the little ones.
Henry Vautrin. a ship's cook, served
thirty days for having disturbed the
peace, and then returned to 825 Jesslo

TABLES TURNED
ON YOUNG GIRL
Bennett Millar Acquitted by
Ju ry of Criminal Assault
Charge at, a Second Trial
JUDGE SO INSTRUCTS
Henriette Eeush, Complain
ing Witness, Ordered Into
Custody of the Sheriff
The second trial of Bennett Millar be
fore a jury In Judge Cook's court on a
charge of criminal assault resulted In his
acquittal yesterday afternoon. At the
first trial the jury disagreed, standing
eleven for conviction and one for acquit
tal. After the jury had been out for
about an hour yesterday it returned into
court, asking for further instructions.'
The Judge instructed them to acquit the
defendant, but said if they had any rea
sonable doubt as to his innocence, they
could ignore that Instruction/;
After the verdict was rendered the
Judge ordered the clerk to place on the
records, the fact that' Henriette Reush,
the young girl who was ; the complaining
witness, had been ordered into 'the cus
tody of the Sheriff pending the laying of
the charge of perjury against her before
the Grand Jury.
"I "don't care to lay the matter before
the Grand Jury," said District Attorney
Byington, "owing to the youth of the
elrl.'l -
"I; have made my order," replied the
Judge,* "and I will Instruct Attorney
Black to get a certified copyiof it."
The girl at the .first "trial testified
strongly against' the defendant, but when
the case was called for the second trial
she said he was innocent and that a boy
named Leopold, was her betrayer. Sub
sequently she said her first story was
correct, and' that the defendant had
begged her for the sake of his wife and
children to testify in court that he was
Innocent. She said he wanted her to
swear. that it was a son of Mr. Brilliant
who was the cause of her trouble and
Brilliant would pay $5000 to hush the mat
ter, up, of which sum she would get half.
Jennie Johtfston, who, it is alleged, ar
ranged the conversation between the girl
and the defendant, is waiting her prelimi
nary examination In the Police Court on
a charge of subornation of perjury.
Millar is a tailor at Z2V,i Ellis street,
and the girl's father has a laundry in the
same building. She is not yet 15 years of
age. . . -

The board of directors of the Stock

this city yesterday and decided to make
the road a standard gauge, and will at
once begin work on the system. After
the entire route in Stockton is changed
the road will be extended into the
county and the adjoining counties, as
it is the policy of the company to make
a complete interurban system to con
nect Stockton with the towns in San
Joaqjjin and Stanislaus counties and
