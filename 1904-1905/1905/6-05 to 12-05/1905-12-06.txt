BANNERMAN
IN SADDLE
IN ENGLAND
Made Premier and
Will Form New
Cabinet.
Liberal Leader to Urge
Peace, Retrenchment
and Reform
Ss>Â«ciÂ«.l Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Dec s.â Moderate Liberalism
assumed control of the British empire
when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman ac
cepted the Premiership from the hands
of Kin^ Edward this morning:. The new
Prime Minister** Cabinet "will be formed
on the7p*flhC!2>??Â»of uritlng Â»ll pluses of
Liberal opinion In support of peace, re
trenchment and reform. The Liberal im
perialists, as ' led by men of the Rose
bery type; the old-fashioned Liberals,
like Jonn Morley and James Bryce: the
militant Radicals, whose hero is David
Lloyd-George â all will have their due
share of representation in Sir Henry's
Ministry.
The Government, as thus organized,
can move along moderate lines, aa any
attempt to force the pace In the matter
of home rule for Ireland would drive the
Liberal Imperialists out of the Cabinet
and defeat its master. It will bÂ« the im
mediate aim of the Liberal party to hold
the fort against protection. On the other
hand, the disposition on the part of the
liberal imperialists to convert the party
of Gladstone into a Unionist organiza
tion permanently would send the extreme
Radicals into the hostile camp.
It happens, therefore, that the men
â¢whom Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
has gathered about him agree first to
stand solidly against the Chamberlain
party of protection, and to press forward
v, ith important measures for reform in
Great Britain; then, using what public
support, they have gained on this side of
St. Ck-orges Channel, to give Ireland
what Sir Henry styles "effective man
agement of Its own don-.estic affairs."
The Irish leaders persevere in the
rtrongeet possible statement of their de
mands, but the Campbell-Bannerman
Government believes that they will not
refuse to recognize the necessity under
which the Liberal party will labor to win
the support of the British electorate be
fore there can be the slightest possibility
of securing home rule for Ireland.
John Redmond has already been no
tified from various sources that the
House of Lords is prepared to kill any
home rule bill which may 1* sent up to it
and to subject any such "revolutionary
proposal" to referendum.
Joseph Chamberlain's secretary to-day
said: "We are prepared to plunge into
the electoral campaign at once. Our bat
tle cry will be "Preferential treatment of
the colonies for imperial purposes.* We
will make the stiffest possible fight
against the disruption of the United
Kingdom."
The Duke of Devonshire, Liberal Union
ist, former Lord President of the Coun
c'L was among the callers on the new
Premier before the latter went to the
palace and in political circles importance
is attached to the visit, as possibly signi
fying some kind of workingÂ«agreement on
certain points of policy between the anti
protectionist Unionists, of which the
Duke has been the recognized leader
since bis secession from the Balfour Cab
inet, and the new Government.
The following official announcement was
made to-night:
Sir Henry Ckrapbell-B*nnennan lnforni#<l
King; Edward that he would be enable to sub
mit bU proposed arrangements in connection
with the formation of a new Government until
December 11. Kins Edward left London this
afternoon to Tislt Lord Arlington at Crlchel,

The Telegraph's correspondent at St.
Petersburg, telegraphing under date of
ilonday, says:
"The fateful question with , which
Russia is now confronted 'is whether
the nation will await the election of the
legislative assembly or help anarchy
to victory. The Cabinet was formed
for the purpose of putting into
the hands of a national assembly, and
if it cannot accomplish this it will re
sign. Theaim of the revolutionists is
to compel 'the Cabinet " to create a se
ries of accomplished facts, â¢ modifying
the manifesto of October 30, which the
Douma shall then be unable to alter.
Thus, they demand a set of temporary
measures, such as equal rights . for all
citizens, which, if granted, .would, by
their very . nature, be not temporary;
but definitive and immutable.
"If the Jewish disabilities are thus
removed by a new ministerial' act anti-
Jewish riots, accompanied by .awful
massacres, would inevitably follow, be
cause the people : .would: resent' any
usurpation by the Ministers of power
belonging only to the' nation and the
Czar. Hence -the Government -is ex
tremely desirous of bringing the Dou
:na together and great haste is now be
ing made to frame an electoral law.
"Probably , an electoral - bill, based
upon universal but not secret suffrage
will be adopted by the' Cabinet, which
is now meeting in council. Assuming:
that the Czar assents, strenuous efforts
will be made to get the Douma ; to
gether by March 6, the anniversary of
the emancipation of' the serfs. The
danger of serious disorders within is
great Indeed. *

pont street and have a length of 3290
feet, while the one under Jackson street
would extend from Hyde to Mason and
have a length of 1556 feet. With one
station on each tunnel, such stations to
be equipped with elevators, the total
cost of the two tunnels would not ex-^
ceed J1.200,000.
"These tunnels would Jiave ample ca
pacity for carrying all the cars now run
on six lines. The present combined
maximum schedules call for 120 cars
per hour in each, direction. If. they
â¢were run through two tunnels it would
mean an interval of one minute upon
â¢ach track in each direction. This in
terval can be greatly reduced In tun
nels, where there would be no interfer
ence. In these tunnels the California,
Sacramento and Clay street lines would
be combined in the California street
'tunnel; and the Union, Jackson and
Washington street lines In that under
Jackson street, suitable connections at
both ends of the tunnels being arranged
to restore the various services to their
respective routes. In order to serve the
population on top of Nob Hill, stations
should be constructed in' the tunnels
tnd equipped with elevators and stair
cases running from the platforms to
the surface of the streets. If two tun
nels were built these stations could be
placed at alternate streets, so that traf
fic going north and south on. Xob Hill
vould not have to walk more than one
block in either direction to get a car at
tbc terminal points or at intervening?
ttit ioriE." - â¢
UAS PLAN TO TERRACE
HEIGHTS FOR CARRIAGES
To make Nob Hill more accessible Mr.
Parsons had this recommendation:
â¢â¢California street is 65 feet wide be
tween houses. There are many places In
San Fj-anclsco where the effective . width
of sidewalk between area railings and
curbs does not exceed six feet, a width
that is sufficient, unless the number of
pedestrians is great, or unless it be a
shopping street, where people efand.
XCfeitfeer of these conditions will ever ob
tain on California street, where the gradi
ents ere steep. If the 6ldewalks were re
duced to this width, there will be left for
the roadway 73 feet. Instead of running
this roadway straight up the hill, it can
be carried in a series of inclined terraces
having- a width of IS feet, sufficient for
two vehicles to pass.
"Taking the steepest block between Du
pont and Stockton streets, where the ele
vation to be overcome is 75 feet in a
distance of 412 feet 6 Inches, giving a rise
of 18.2 feet per 100 feet, the length of an
incline whose direction on the straight
psrts would be at right angles to the axis
of the street would have a length along
its center line of 762 feet, to ascend the
same elevation, giving a rise of only 9.54
feet per 100 feet. This is a gradient that
horses can climb and descend.
"At each bend there could be built a
etub-end roadway, directly next to the
curb and descending at any convenient
slope, but preferably at about 5 per cent.
A wagon or carriage wishing to reach a
house not located on the bend of the roafi
way could turn' into any one of these
terraces, and as they form with the
curves a series of roadways on each side
making an almost continuous stretch, it
would be possible to stop a wagon in front
of every door. At Jhe same \u25a0 time .. the
Eicetvalks should be reconstructed to the
new grades, and to compensate *for the
difference between the* two gradients
Ehort flights of easy stairs should be In
troduced, most conveniently at or near
the ends of the stub roadways. The
present sidewalks "with over IS per cent
rise are exceedingly difficult to r climb, but
walks on a S per, cent rise with short
flight* of about 14 steps every 80 feet will
be found entirely convenient.
"The space between the terraces on
California street, or on a wider, street if
one should be made, can be partly paid
out with parks and ma.de an attractive
Â«s well as a practical improvement of the
nrst magnitude. No changing of. houses
Â«md no ecquleition of private, property
trill be needed for this Improvement. The
:ost will be confined to thj doing of the
R-ork, which will consist of regrading the
surface of the street, where excavation
should substantially, balance fill, the
building of the terrace walls, amounting
to about 550,000 for the two blocks,' and

though, of course, on a somewhat smaller
scale than was shown for California
street. As an illustration, a standard
San Francisco street with a width of
68 feet 9 inches has been taken and a
gradient of 22 Dor cent assumed, this
being in accordance with the facts as
now existing In certain streets. Under
these conditions It is found that a ter
raced roadway 16 feet wide and with a
gradient of but 11 per cent can be built,
showing that this same method can be
applied at a comparatively small expense
to make even narrow .streets available
for a class of traffic heretofore forbid
den. The assumption of a 22 per cent
grade being practically a maximum, 0t
will be understood that the application
of the suggested improvement upon less
hilly streets will ba still, more effective.
Thus, upon streets having gradients of
16 l>er cent, of which there are many in
San Francisco, the grade may be reduced
to approximately only^B per cent.
"While this arrangement can be adopted
on these narrow streets, it will be better
where traffic is heavy to expand it either
by widening one of the standard streets,
or, what would be an improvement of still
greater benefit, by purchasing the, blocks
between two such streets and throwing
the intervening space into a terraced
parkway.' Thus, in the blocks between
Jackson and Washington streets, and be-,
tween Mason and Jones streets, which
include a portion of the eastern slope of
Nob Hill, where the existing gradients
are excessive, there might be given a
grand boulevard 332 feet between build
ings, permitting sidewalks 14 feet wide,
with a space of 354 feet inside for ter
racing. On' this a roadway could be con
structed 25 feet wide with a gradient of
about 6 per cent in lieu of the existing
maximum gradient of 19.4 ' per cent.
"As the buildings to be ; removed be
tween Washington and ' Jackson streets
are, as a rule, of simple character, : the
cost will probably not be excessive, to
which, as a partial offset,' would be a
decided increase In actual and taxablo
values, with consequent return in annual
income to the city. No estimate of the
expense of this Improvement has been
made, as we _have no knowledge of the
property values. < _ -
uivijsuaL problems are

"The conditions existing to-day *in
this section of San Francisco and surely
cominsr in other hilly districts are ab
normal to those of any other city, of
the same size and promise in the world,
and special means must be devised to
meet the conditions. In many Euro
pean cities similar problems have been
met by the use of stairways, but these
cities are usually old and small, and
the conditions of life are much less
complex than those existing in a mod
ern American city, destined, as'yoiirs Is,
<o be a leader in the new century. Un
der these circumstances almost any
thing is better than your present con
ditions on many streets, and I believe
that a careful study of the matter Avill.
T*veal that by combining the -two
methods here proposed practically all
yourj streets may be so graded as to
allow for loaded, team delivery, and, of
course, carriage an.l cab service. '. If
the work were wisely ; undertaken it
need 'not be excessively expensive;. none
of it so much so bufthatlthe'Jn'c'reaeed,

executed with the aid of' landscape

city and give it. a* unique place among
the hill cities of the. world:
"The making' of these terraces would,
of course, have to^bedone by. the city.
Tnu building of thfe tunnels which
would make, the terraces possible .could
be constructed by and at the expense of
the ; municipality, like . the subways in
New York 'and Boston, and leased to thu
surface railway -V companies. . As_ this
rental could be fixed at a rate some
what higher than the rate on the bonds
Issued for the cost, of the worki such
excess*, together with the increase in
taxable value* on Nob Hill, might be
made under proper financial manage

SUPPLIES STATISTICS "
. AXD 'ADVOCATES ' SYSTEM
\u25a0Concerning the reasons for unifying the
street* railways of ; San Francisco fin one
trolley electric system, : Mr. Parsons ; quot
ed a mass of figures 'and related much of
the experience of otherHarge cities. The
topography and distribution of the popu
lation of San Francisco were considered
and the statement wae made that density
of population suggestea the principal con
sideration in the transit in any district.
He found that the street railway systems
of San Francisco had 288.72 miles of track
and that they carried 154,000.000 passen
gers, In round numbers, per annum. The
greatest travel was on the McAllister
street; line.
After, some general analysis, Mr. Par
6ons said that 50,000 . persons are com
pelled i to transfer" daily between ' the
Market-street cars and five tributary
lines, a great inconvenience to the public.
Passengers coming to and going from San
Francisco , were estimated at 27,660,000. Jl'Of
this total about 25,000,000, or say 90 per
cent, are suburban passengers, carried to
and^from San Francisco at the- rate of
about 70,000^ daily." The' ideal condition
was said by^Mr. Parsons to be" when a
passenger can take a car at any point and
go to a destination on the same car with
out transferring. .':â¢! :
The conduit system, Mr. Parsons
declared, had ' been a % complete . failure
In Boston; .was taken *up " In New York
as the result of an accident and was con
fined there lto Manhattan Island, .-.while
roads from the suburbs entered by: troll ey
the northern part 'of, the :, Manhattan
island and also entered by way of-the
ESast : River bridges from Brooklyn. 'In
New York City there were 870.U- miles of
track using lac overhead . trolley, , 212.49
miles using ; the conduit ; system and 99.47
miles using horsepower. Some conduits
were to be found ; in Europe In , a few of
the â¢ larger - capitals, .. but . they/ played s an
Insignificant part, even London, : Paris and
Berlin. Glasgow. . Liverpool,, Manchester
and Hamburg â¢ had ; unified on ' the , over
head trolley.'* No Eastern city made use
now, of i the conduit, except Washington
and ; New .York. .
Mr. : ParÂ«onÂ« would not recommend the
conduit, system,. for either the ; Sutter
street- or i Geary,- streat r lines! - He ' would
have ; thÂ« cablo lines \u25a0 on Market, street

PATRICK CAI.HOUN ' TALKS v
* FQR UNITED " RAILROADS
Desire* to Convert . Cables Into
Electric Lines Where It Is
.Possible,
Patrick Calhoun of .the United Rail
roads, speaking on the general topic.as
sured â¢ the assembled merchants that
".whatever I difference of - opinion may ex
ist in regard to the best method of de
veloping strict railroad transportation in
San Francisco, ; there was one' common
platform upon which all might stand, :
which was: Let us do what is best; for
San Francisco." He also said that his as
sociates . were not actuated by any; nar
row and contracted policy. ,' They, had ex
pended more . than $3,500,000 in- the 7 im
provement of the lines of the United Rail
roads In this city and had greatly im
proved the physical condition . of the
roads' Under; the plans already: formu
lated, the United Railroads Company con
templated the expenditure of' $8,000,000 to
$10,000,000 more. 1 "It only awaits the adop
tion by your* city of a wise and far-sight-;]
ed policy to begin this work,". he said.' "i
"Withsthe adoption of -electricity," he!
said, "the trolley roads in other, cities
\u25a0have extended ; Into ' unpeopled '\u25a0:. suburbs,',
which are rapidly building up, while your
cable roads have left large territories
within easy reach of your; business cen
ters unpeopled.: The census of 1900 shows
that 300,000 of your citizens live within a
radius of three miles of Kearny and Mar
ket, streets and only 42,000 in all the ; ter
ritory beyond^ For short distances of
two or three miles * and - for ': r travel \u25a0 that
has not become. congested, Mhe cable is a
safe and effective means of <; transporta
tion. For longer distances and for mobile j
operation no power.; has yet j been I found
SO' effective as electricity."
; This; was the text that Mr. Calhoun fol
lowed throughout his address: The solu
tion of the street railroad problem he
declared to be in the conversion of
cable roads, as far as practicable, into
electric -operation, to give an Increased
and more :, efficient service in the con
gested districts and to bring near-by sub
urbs > Into close relations with business
centers. , It might be;, wise] to tunnelsome
of the hills of San Francisco, but this
would be merely incidental to surface
transportation : beyond.
All the territory lying to the northward [
of Market -street and I north of , Halght
street, he said.^could bebetter served by
surface transportation than by any other
method. The total distance from Sutter
and Kearny streets . to ' the Cliff House
was less than six; miles; the large; areas
covered by-the Presidio and Golden -Gate
Park left only. the narrow Richmond' dis-"
trlct to be served' in the section beyond
Presidio "avenue. East -of : Presidio ave
nue the United Railroads had fourteen
lines of track running east and west. In
'addition were the Union, Geary and Cali
fdrnlarstreet.roads. The distance; from
; Kearny.-an9'" Market streets to Presidio
avenue was ; only two "and four-tenths
miles. "With ', fourteen lines of track to
serve the population . living .^within ; this
district, â¢ no _ underground or. subway sys
tem couldbe successfully built; nor could
the; population -in that territory already;
built "ud '.become ; so | dense ; as to prevent;
the surface : lines from, affording; consid-'
erable transportation to" every part of it.
"The transportation problem, of this dis
trict," said-* Mr.' Calhoun, i''ii' simple. It
only requires effective electric ; service,
with through cars from the ' ferries "and
from points on Market street; Under
first-class electric service,' the time from'
Kearny and Market streets 'to the PreÂ»
sldlo would be seventeen minutes;- to the
Cliff House thirty minutes and to Golden
Gate -Park twenty minutes.'*.
The Ideal motive power for San Fran
cisco. Mr. Calhoun ; said, was -, electricity, i
except for that portion: of .the- territory
that was too steep' to'^permit electric op
eration." Transportation should be served
by ; surface lines, with tunnels ;; through
some, of the lmaortant hills, as; an inci
dent' to. surface ; ; transportation,", as ; had
been suggested by; Mr. Parsons: It, wpuld
be necessary to maintain a certain num
ber of cable\roads on the steep â¢ grades.
It would be more comfortable? for people
to climb to ; the high points by; cable cars '
than by i elevators from . underground. ,
Some of the : streets to; Nob J Hill should
be "so arranged; as to make carriage and
automobile ; traveling, safe ; and "\u25a0 comforta
ble. .The United Railroads , would "careful
ly study these suggestions,' and would
cordially co-operate |In [ carrying ; out any
plansthat;were practicable, and effective.
"The most pressing, improvement of? the
transportation ! system of San ; Francisco."
Mr. Calhoun ' paid, ,"\* . the
the ; cable â¢ roads -on L; Market street Into
lines propelled by electricity. An oppor-r
tunity should be afforded, '.off running
through { electric Â». cars \ from ' : the ', ferries
\ia Butter and other streets, i From > Mar
ket and Castro streets quick lines'of com
munication should J be ;; extended . into the
Sunset District^, To accomplish; this: it will,
probably become 'necessary /to; tunnel,un
der] the ; Twin Peaks | or?, aome other â¢ part
of }\u25a0. the hills ' . adjacent :'; thereto.' ; A .line
should be, built from; Market street; south
alonp Church \ and "I Dolores I streets .; In ' : as "
nearly a direct line as 'possible] to Baden.'
At Church and Market etreets cuch a line
would ; connect ; with ," the /Flllmore-street

ONE DOLLAR PEB YEAE.HEAD OF THE PHILIPPINE
COMMISSION ARRIVES.
The agricultural districts of the Philippine Islands are to be brought in direct communi
cation with tidewater by means of a Â£30,000,000 system of railroads. Bids for the
privilege of building these roads will be opened December 15 in Washington in the
â¢ presence of Governor General Luke E. Wright and Commissioner W. Cameron Forbes,
who arrived here yesterday on the liner Manchuria.
Governor General Luke E. Wright Talks of the Islands
Luke E. Wright, Governor General
cf the Philippines, accompanied by Mrs.
TTrig-ht, arrived yesterday on the liner
M-rvchuria. He left his post on a six
months' leave of absence and is looking
torw&iA to a pleasant vacation. Part
of hia lisne he will spend in Washing
ten, advising Congress and the admin
istration as to the needs of the Philip
pines.
The matter of tariff legislation will
rÂ«oeive his "particular attention. His
as to what changes would be ad
Â«table for the benefit of Philippine de
velopment he reserves for the authori
ties at Washington. Governor Wright
believes In the Filipino.
"The Filipino," he says, "will work
vh.en he is properly paid. The re
liability, whioh at present he largely
looks, will come in time, and I think
the Filipino, if given a fair chance â
end he is now In a fair way of getting
It â will work out his own salvation.
Eat he will not be hurried. Railroads
\u25a0ire needed to open up the country and
2 nope that before I return to Manila
American capital will be interested in
the Philippines on a much larger scale
t!:an it now is. The crops are good this
year and the natives appear to be con
tented and happy. I have no fear of
another revolution."
During the Manchuria's ttay in
Honolulu Governor Wright visited sev
eral large sugar plantations and is con
vinced that the Hawaiian Islands can
teach much of great value to the
Philippines. The sugar crop in the
Philippines has dropped, he says, from
PROMINENT PASSENGERS WHO ARRIVED ON* THE STEAMER MANCHURIA
YESTERDAY. THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY TO WASHINGTON. WHERE
THEY WILL. ASSIST CONGRESS IN SOLVING PHILIPPINE PROBLEMS
200,000 tons to 100,000 tons. Rinderpest
lias killed many of the cattle, upon
vhich the Filipinos depend for trans
porting their products. On the planta
tions crude and wasteful methods are
employed at every stage and low wages
etu-act labor of an indifferent quality.
In time. Governor Wright believes, all
these fault 6 will b* straightened out
end tfien the Philippines will prosper Jn
accordance with the measure of their
great fruitfulnees.
la Governor Wright's party are five
men whoee visit to Washington will
mean much for the future of the
Philippines.
- TV. Cxmeron Forbes, a member of the
Philippine Commission, is going to the
national capital for the opening, on De
cember 18, of bids for the construction
of railroads In the Philippines. The
bulldinrof these roads will represent
an outlay of J30.000.000.
k W. C Welborn is chief of the
TÂ§ureau of Agriculture in the Philip
pines and E. Delarama is a wealthy
sugar planter. Both men will be on
hand to furnish Congress with any in
formation it may require In regard to
the needs of the islands. Delarama is

personally concerned In the proposed
revision of the tariff and will be able to
furnish at first hand the views of the
class most interested In legislation of
this kind. Commander J. M. Helm of
the United States navy is in charge of
the Philippine coast guard service. G.
B. Rea is the other member of this
commission for the enlightening of "Wash
ington as to the needs of tha Philip
pines.
The proposed railroads are to be
built by private capital, but the Gov
ernment will guarantee the interest on
first mortgage bonds at not more than
4 per cent for thirty years. Whatever
payments the Government may make
under this guarantee will be a lien on
the roads. The privilege of building theae
roads will be granted only to. citizens
of the United States or of the Philip
pine Islands. According \u25a0to present
plans there will be several railroads In
Luzon, one each In Negros, Cebu, Panay
and Samar. No. roads will be built in
Mindanao or In Mlndora, these Islands
being comparatively wild and but
eparsely settled.
Commissioner Forbes will return to
the Philippines as poon as the railroad
concessions have been settled.

' NEW YORK, Dec. s.â lnstances In
which the Mutual Reserve Life Insurance
Company paid an aggregate of about
$20,000 in what Vice President George. D.
Eldredge of that company called "hold
ups" were related to the: life insurance
Investigating committee by Eidredge to
day. In one case, in IS9S, Eldredgc testi 1
ried, the company paid - $15,000 to John
McDonald, a Philadelphia lawyer, who
had. been active in organizing the policy
holders of the .Mutual Kestrve Life \u25a0 Insur
ance Company Into a movement which
charged President -\u25a0 /ederick A. Burnham
of that company wllja mismanagement
and demanded his removal. The charges
also^ reflected upon Eidredge's. manage
ment as vice president and a threat was
made to ask for the appointment of a
receiver for the company.. . . â¢ \u25a0
Engaged in this movement of the policy
holders also was J. S/HofTecker, a for
mer, auditor of the company, who had
btenydismissed or had resigned. Before
leaving the company Hoftecker informed
President Burnham that he resigned be
cause their ideas a 3* to 'common aonesty
diftered so much and because he knew of
so many - questionable transactions of
which President Burnham had approved,
i^dredge declared' that Hoffecker was hot
dismissed until he had demanded an in
crease in salary from $35 to 3100 a .week
and practically said It was safer for the
company to. keep him than to let him go,
in view of what he knew about me com
pany.
"Another instance of a 'hold-up,' " Eld
redge said, "was In IS9O. when Max Beeh
ler, a so-called examiner of the lowa
Insurance Department, came to : New
York, with his son' as an assistant, ex
amined the Mutual Reserve Life Insur
ance Company and presented to it a bill
for VJS9 for the examination. Rather than
pay the bill, the company withdrew it 3
business from lowa, but a little later it
paid that bill and another of $346 to Max
Beehler for a verillcation of his, previous
examination, -in order to get permission
again to do business in lowa." _\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0-..
Eldredge ' told also how he ; tried to . se
cure a license for his company : to do
business in Missouri in IS9S and found
that it would have to i employ W. H.
Phelps as attorney before it could do so.
Phelps got the license for the company in
three days, and was paid $3500 as "illegal
fees," Eldredge said. â¢ ~* V'
Eldredge testltied. that he. was certain
there was no truth in the statement made
to a Canadian investigatfVig \" committee
by James D. Wells, former vice president
of the Mutual Reserve, that President
Burnham of that company had told Wells
he had to raise $40,000 to pay. to the New

Ihe Government, it is reported, nar
rowly frustrated a plot whereby a
Land of armed men had planned to raid
the State treasury. One of the consplr
uto;-s, it is said, betrayed his fellows,
whereupon the leaders, knowing that
their attack could be repulsed by the
troops with great slaughter, abandoned
it. Ttio existence of this conspiracy led
to a report that martial law would be
proclaimed to-morrow (Tuesday), but
this is authoritatively denied.
The extension of the strike of the tel
egraphers to the postal system is com
luctfc and the paralysis of business is
Increasing; the danger of a financial cri
sis. The strike of the Moscow tele
phone operators, who cut the wires ,
and tore up the poles, has severed the j
last means of communication with the j
ancient capital. i
STRIKERS LOSE SYMPATHY.
The present conditions are unbear
able. Sympathy with the poorly paid
post and telegraph employes is now
turning into indignation against the
strikers and the public is supporting a
formidable movement, which has been
started by all classes, to throw the
yoke ef the revolutionaries. ...
The Government is undoubtedly en
couraging the organizing of these
forces. The "Law and Order party"
took the lead, which is now being fol
lowed by the "Society of Strike-Break
ers," but the most important- movement
has been started under the leadership
of Father Gapon, the former idol of
the workmen, who since his residence
abroad has become convinced that Rus
sia ls not prepared for a republic and
Is appealing to his old comrades to cut
loose from the revolutionary agitators.
The latter already charge that Father
Gapon has been bought and that he Is
a traitor to the cause of the people.
Father Gapon, however, is sincere and
his influence undoubtedly is great.
This being a holiday. Father Gapon
attended meetings of eleven of the or
ganizations which he controlled before
January 22 ("red Sunday"), at which
his words were cheered to the echo. At
these meetings the Socialist orators
were howled down and in some cases
forcibly ejected. ." ---;:"
If this movement should grow and an
effective f-plit among the workmen be
thereby created, it will prove of im
measurable service to the Government
in tiding things over until the meeting
of the Douma.
EMPEROR REVIEWS TROOPS.
The Emperor this morning reviewed
the Simnovsky regiment at Tsarskoe-
Belo. Grand Duke Vladimir and Grand
Duke Nicholas Nicholaievitch were
present. The Emperor drank to the
health of the regiment. His Majesty
appeared to be in good health.
This was a great holiday in *St.
Petersburg and all the factories end
mills are closed. The principal work
men's meeting was held in a large hall
known as Salt City and was attended
by more than 1000 persons. Father
Gapon was In the audience, but he was
not recognized. When his name was
mentioned by the speakers It was re
ceived with great cheering.
Among the speakers at the meeting
were several Social Democrats, who
urged upon the workmen that their
salvation depended upon the realiza
tion of the political programme out
lined by the Socialists. The workmen
refused to listen to these appeals,
which were received with shouts of
"Enough! enough!" The Social Demo
crats were thoroughly discomfited. .
After their departure the meeting
proceeded to discuss the organization
of monster unions, which, it was de
cidod, would be formed in accordance
with plans outlined by Father Gapon
at a previous meeting.
Several of the speakers clamored for
amnesty for Father Gapon and a depu
tation was appointed to wait upon

take place about the first of the year,

all its energies toward spreading' its pro

would be ready to set up a provisional

LA FOLLETTE
ACCEPTS TOGA
Governor of Wisconsin
Will Take a Seat in
the United States Senate
MADISON, Wis.. Dec. 6.â After reading
his message to the Legislature to-day
Governor La Follette announced that he
would accept the United States Senator
ship to which he was elected by- the Leg
islature at the last session.- Governor La
Follette's resignation will take effect dur
ing the present special session of the Leg
islature or at the end of the session.
Four recommendations afe made In the
Governor's message regarding the revi
sion of the railroad rate commission law.
In the first he recommends that the com
mission be authorized to prescribe. a uni
form system of keeping accounts of the
business transacted in Wisconsin by the
railroads, . and that all railroads should
be required to. file with the commission
from time to time reports of their in
come. He' wants separate accounts kept
of the business done by the roads in this
State and in other States, as well as an
account showing the value of each rail
road In this State.
His second recommendation provides
that the law be so amended that special
mileage tickets, commutation tickets, ex
cursion tickets and party tickets can be
Issued at less than the regular rates for
the National Guard and Grand Army en
campments, to students, homeseek
ers, etc.
His third recommendation provides for
additional power by the commission to
Investigate rates. ,
The fourth recommendation gives the
commission power to decide what safe
guards shall be erected at any railroad
crossing in this State,
Regarding railroad taxes, the ' Governor
says that $1,144,399 in railroad taxes Is now
due the State, the payment of which has
been held up by litigation. He says that
the holding up of just taxes by the rail
roads is a serious embarrassment to the
State, and, had the taxes been paid, the
State tax levy, would not have been nec
essary. He recommends that legislation
be enacted at once which, in the future,
will compel the prompt payment of all
railroad taxes, leaving the railroad the
right to recover such taxes. If it shall be
found that they were unjust or wrong
fully collected.

might be allowed to make a fitting win
dow display. He did not really mean it,
but Durkin came back promptly with a
letter, through the Spokesman-Review, in
which he offered the use of his windows
to the pastor without money and without
price. The offer nearly took the wind
out of the minister's sails and. he hedged
over night, but to-day he met Durkin
and they arranged for the use of all the

MARK TWAIN
70 YEARS OLD
Dean of American Humor
ists Is Guest of Honor
I at a.Banquet in New York
HAS JOYOUS BIRTHDAY
Reasons Why He Is Hale and
Hearty Are Explained iii
a Characteristic Speech
Special DUpatch to The. Call.
NEW YORK) Dec. : 8.-Mark Twain
had a joyous birthday party to-night
at Delmonlco's.- Colonel George Harvey
gave him a dinner. The guests were
writers of fiction and nearly one-half
of them were women. The souvenlr^for
each : guest was a bust of Mark Twain,
half life-size. There- was a photograph
gallery, too, so that the guests, in table
groups of eight, had their ' portraits
taken to nil- an 'album for the guest of
honor. Many telegrams and letters of
congratulations were read.
"I wish it was in my "power," wrote
President Roosevelt, "to be at the din
ner held to Celebrate the 70th birthday
of Mark Twain; it: is difficult to write
of him by his real name, instead of that
which has become a household word
wherever the English language', is
spoken. He ls one of the citizens whom
all Americans delight ;,to honor, for he
has rendered a great and peculiar ser
vice to, Americans, and â¢â¢ his writings,
though such as no one but' an American
could, have written, yet emphatically
come within that small list which are
written f.or no particular country, but
for all countries, and \u25a0 which are not
merely written for the time being, but
have an abiding and permanent value.
May he live long and year by year may
he "add to the sum of admirable work
that he has done."
, From London came a cablegram of
greetings signed by forty: of England's
leading authors. There" were cordial
letters, poems of praise and tributes of
affection from many American authors."
And, when Colonel Harvey Introduced
the guest of honor to -make a little
speech everybody cheered. Mr. Clem
ens explained how he had "beat the
doctor and hangman for seventy years,"
saying:
Since 40 1 -have ; been', regular about going
to bed and getting upâ and that is one of
the main things. I have made it a rule to
go to bed when ; there was not anybody left
tp sit up with; and I have made It a rule
to get up when I had to. This has resulted
in an unswerving regularity of irregularity.^ ;
In the matter of diet, which ls another
main thing. I have been persistently strict in
sticking to things which did not agree with
me. until one or the other of us got the
better of It. Until lately I got the better of
it myself, but last spring I stopped frolicking
with mince pie after midnight. Up -to then
I had always believed It was not loaded.

GOVEBtf OK IS PEESENT
Pardee Delivers Address
and Several 'Other Men of
Prominence Read V Papers
SANTA ROSA, Dec. 5. â The California
State Fruit-! Growers*"- Convention con
vened this morning in Ridgeway Hall.
There was a large attendance. After
an invocation by Rev. William Martin,"
pastor of the. First Presbyterian Church,
Mayor John P. Overton delivered an
address of welcome and Kllwood Coop
er, State Horticultural Cornrr.issioner,
was introduced and delivered the open
ing address. In part 'he &aid: .
' This is -the Uitrty-flrst State Fruit Growers'
. convention and the tourth held under the aus
pices -or the State Commission. It 1b a pleasure
that. we meet, under more favorable conditions
than ws have met for several years past. The'
ruling prices for deciduous products have been
unprecedented ,:\u25a0 considering the quantities
shipped. -This condition ot the market has re
sulted from various causes. Many, theories
have' been' civen to account for the great in
crease In the Â£>ric*3. '\u25a0:\u25a0 First, the industrial
prchperityr-.throughout: the entire \u25a0 country, also
the Bhort--crop ot some ot the standard fruits,
the* discussion of the; private car lines by the
Interstate â¢ Commerce Commission and the \u25a0 de
termination or. the part of President Roose
velt to Vovern the freight charges and restrict
the action of the refrigeration combine. What
ever may have beÂ£n the cause, our producers
have received the benefit and are thankful.
I have discussed the subject ot. pure food
for many yeafs, having from . the reports of
the Board of Health in San Francisco the re
sults of Its inyestizatlons of the jams and
Jellies in the market.. Many of these were
largely" adulterated and quite a number were
substitutions not containing any of the iruit
which they purported to be. These spurious
article* c.re put on the market at prices tar.
txilow what the real fruit could be offered tor.
Hundreds of tons of oranges go to waste every
year,' "also lemons,, and the berry Industry Is
often depressed for want of a market.
The Question of a pure label law has been
before the legislature many times. Many peo
ple have j their attention diverted from the
real pumbse of such legislation and are made
to believe that it ls an attempt to control what
they should eat and drink. So such intention
was ever inaugurated in any bill proposed. It
is jlmply a claim, that every article intended
for. human consumption should..; be truthfully
represented on \ the label./
At the conclusion of Mr. Cooper's re
marks Governor Pardee addressed the
convention. His remarks 'were Inter
esting: and appropriate} and were heard
with close attention. He said: ' â¢
I : realize that this is a' gathering of men
who - are, ' In one way or another, - specialists,
and 1 shall not undertake to Instruct any one
of- my hearers in his specialty, whether it be
orchard or vineyard,' wine or raisin making,
the marketing of fruit products or - the study
of plant and tree diseases. All I shall attempt
to do ls to talk to you about the general eco
nomic aspects of our great fruit Industry and
thÂ«n add something in \u25a0 regard :to the efforts
which the State â¢ and . Federal governments are
making to promote it. , \u25a0 -â¢'â¢\u25a0.\u25a0
No J one kno-ya Just what the value is to
California of this great industry,' because there
are no complete statistics, although it is by
common consent agreed that it constitutes our
largest single j Interest. . . In the census of 19UO
the value of the fruit products of .the United
States was given as $131,000,000,". of ;,which
California claimed $28,000,HXK), or 21% .'per cent.
These figures were- sufficient '.to, show how. far
California had outstripped, every, other I State,
for N^w York, the next largest producer, con
tributed less than $16, 000, 000. But these fig
ures are \u25a0 six years old. One expert, now* esti
mates California 1 s-'fruit products at $50,000,
600, while another competent 'judge places the
figure at $80,000,000. ...-,â¢-â¢.;-.-â¢ m
the -shipping season Just 1 closed there
have been forwarded more j than 8000 carloads
of deciduous fruits, which -went to, 135 Eastern
cities; from which it was redistributed so wlde
ly.that there waa scarcely a town 4n the North
ern States .In which the : Inhabitants could, not
enjoy fresh California fruit. . ;:.-'\u25a0,:â¢â¢\u25a0.â¢\u25a0 â¢
.'â¢But the . magnitude of this ; movement of
fresh fruits," great aa lt"lB, will be far out
done this, year by ' the trade- in citrus fruits,
Just commencing, j More - than 30,000 carloads
of . oranses and\- lemons were sent to Eastern
markets last season, the .value amounting jto
not far from $15,000.0C0. and even this | won
derful record will .be surpassed -during .the
coming year.. Add to these figures 4000 : car
loads of raisins, [ 5500' carloads of prunes, 500
or 600 carloads !of walnuts, .the, canned and
i dried fruit, and the wine and the' brandy, and
you will have a quantltlve measure of the fruit
Industry of the State. ' \u25a0 .
\u25a0 The fruit producer* of California have al
ready conquered so many difficulties that there
Is reason to believe | they | â¢will continue ' to ,win
success, '\u25a0 and, although excessive expansion is
to be deprecated as dangerous, further.devel
opment, if judiciously- managed, is â¢ probably
as safe aa moet â¢ business , lnvÂ«stments. -The
whole -question is one, of education. We will
have' all of. the market we- need, when" we
succeed. . in' 'convincing consumers - that they
need" the articles which California, alone 'can
produce. *or can produce in greater perfection
than any other, region. In the natural .order
of events ' demand and supply" will: be equal
ized and the regions "in which frutt growing
will be .prosperous will be-those in which frutt
can 'be-, produced ..at .lowest cost:, and of. the
finest Quality, . because in fruit) more than in
-roost' other things, quality In. something. about
which- everybody is particular. And -here is
where we will win in the 'competition, thanks
to : the California climate- and â¢ soil, _ supple
mented by the greater intelligence of our hor

- As an ' evidence , of., how- everything ..; agri
cultural tends to come to California we expect
this 'year three national conventions of \u25a0 pecu
liar interest to farmers,' and there will also be
three- national educational conventions. l - - / â¢ y

MINIATURE NAVY BUILT.
HAS FAMOUS SEA FIGHT REPRODUCED AT THE PALACE
The Dowager Empress of China takes a
keen Interest in the affairs of the outside
world. After the battle of the Sea of
Japan she became imbued with the idea
that a naval battle must be a spectacle
worth looking at. So she ordered the
construction cf a miniature navy and on
the sacred lotus ponds surrounding- the
imperial palace a number of naval en- â¢
gagements were fought for her delecta- '
tion. The miniature fights -were made as
realistic as the most ingenious engineers
In China could make them, and as nearly
as possible the battle of the Sea of Japan
â¢was reproduced.
This siory of the Dowager's attempt
tÂ» bring the scenes of the outside world
within her palace walls was told on the
Manchuria yesterday by Hubert Vos, a
Kew York artist, who has just returned
from Peking:, where he has been painting
a portrait of the Dowager Empress.
Seven years ago Vos painted the por
trait of Prince Chlng. Through the
Prince he was given the commission he
*Â£ . -s just completed.
â¢ The old lady gave Vos a sitting every
corning at 5 o'clock. At the palace gates
Vos waÂ» received by Prince Ta Chun, who
is Minister of Commerce, and Wu Ting
Fang. Poor Wu, the spoiled pet of Wash
ington society during his stay at the na
tional capital, is little better than a door.
tnat at the imperial palace, where he
holds the job of Interpreter.
Voi says that nobody in China is aa
well read in the traditions of Chinese art
aa Is the Dowager Empress. *
"She is a wonderful woman," said tlie
sutler- "When you think that In a land
where woman has no rights, ehe, a
woman, has for forty-five years held
6own a throne to which she has no more
title than I have, and this with, the right
ful occupant hanging around, you have
to take oft your hat to her nerve and
ability."
The most powerful man In China to-day,
Eayc Vos, Is Yuan Shi Kal. Viceroy of
Chili. It waÂ» Yuan Shi Kal who. six
\u25a0weeks ago, put 60.000 ChinesÂ© troops in
the nÂ«ld to show the foreign military
representatives that China could take
care of any Boxer outbreak, or any other
Internal trouble, with, her own forces. It
was a great demonstration and opened
the eyes of the xnilifciry experts. Vos
witnessed the maneuvers.
BELIEVES BOYCOTT SERIOUS.
Commander of the Raleish Come*
Horn* on the User JHanehurla.
Captain A. C. Baker. U. S. X., late
commander, of the Raleigh, which was
to Hongkong during the early
incitement arising out of the Chinese
boycott of American goods, was a pas
senger on the Manchuria. The Raleigh
was relieved by the Oregon. Captain
Baker has come home to be retired at
his own request. The Raleigh was not
called upon to interfere in any way
wuh affairs ashore, and, except that he
believes It serious. Captain Baker will
not discuss the boycott. He said: "If
you want to know all about the boycott
a.-k the Sperry Flour Company. It hit it
hardest and I guess it knows more
about It than anybody else. I'm only
a sailorman and sailors know nothing
about business."
Tne massacre of the American mis
sionaries at Lienchow occurred shortly
before Captain Baker left Hongkong
&nd be knows nothing about it, he says,
except what he read in the papers.
j^AsociiK^fw-o** the . Manchuria . say
there was little doubt .in the Orient
that the boycott was directly respon
sible for the feeling which led to the
murder of the missionaries. Other pas
sengers declare that the missionaries
provoked the natives by uncalled for or
at least 111-advised Interference with a
native religious celebration. The find
ing of a skeleton In the missionary
quarters is said to have contributed
not a little to the feeling against the
Americans. This skeleton was used for
the anatomical Instruction of medical
students. The Chinese believed the
bones were those of some Asiatic' vic
tim of a missionary spell and the story
of how these strangers from America
were desecrating the sacred, bones of
the Chinese 'dead aroused all the
fanatical anger of the missionaries' yel-
Aovr neighbors.

NEW YORK, Dec. 6.â George W. Per
kins was to-day elected chairman of the
Pere Marquette Railroad. His election to
the same office in the Cincinnati, Hamil
ton and Dayton road makes him the ex
ecutive head of the two properties. There
have been no changes In the boards of

to-day to confirm or deny the report
that suits are to be started against the

COREY'S WIFE
NOW IN RENO
No Chance of Eeconciliation
Between Head;of the Steel
Combine and His Spouse
PITTSBURG, Dec. s.â According to the
friends of .Mrs.. William ;Ellis Corey,, wife
of the president of the United States Steel
Corporation, the breach between the cou
ple is so complete that it will never be
healed, \u25a0no ' matter what ; action may be
taken by her husband, j j The agreement
to separate came after carefdl considera
tion and after, It Is said;* Mrs. Corey could
no- longer "continue as the wife of .tne
head of the 'steel trust". -. Mrs. Corey is
now In ; Reno; Nev. . â¢ ' to : which city she
went to secure'residence" prior to bringing
suit for divorce." She' is accompanied by
Miss Ada Corey, her 'sister-in-law, who
is standing with Mrs. : Corey in her trou
ble with her brother.'*' -
In the little town of; Braddock, where
the - Coreys ' lived before they became
wealthy, sympathy: ls'expressed on every
side for â¢ Mrs. Corey.' 'Friends, both in
Braddock and in Pittsburgh, are protesting
against' Mrs. Corey's acceptance of a set
tlement -of â¢ $700,000 and ' $300,000 by her
son, Allan. â¢ They declare that Mrs. Corey
Is entitled to a far j larger amount ' and
that they; wlir help her'fight to secure it.
According to stories ,in circulation here
to-day, ! Mrs. Corey has i nothing in 5 her
own name. S It' is reported: here that re
cently In New York r Corey, notified all
the shopkeepers and hotels that he would
not be' responsible for' debts contracted by
his wife. She was forced to live on what
ever her husband chose to give her and
was unable toi contract' any bills In his
name. While. the publication of the story
to-day created much * talk generally, still
It was so well known; In business circles
that- the scandal was coming that wonder
was expressed that It--' had not become
public before. V; / f ; - i
Last night when It became known that
the>tory was out in-New York, the local
papers prepared to publish It. They were
frustrated by a powerful Influence which
was brought to ,bear.\< This morning only
one newspaper In Pittsbucf published the
etory, using . the New % York story and
making It look as much . as possible like
a denial.., Relatives of. Corey almost with
out exception,- sympathize wfth 'Mrs.
.Corey. .Many of them go so'far as to de
clare that Corey's success : In life . was
largely due to 'the 'untiring efforts of his
wife. '..- \u25a0-' "\u25a0 *"~ \u25a0'*\u25a0\u25a0-; .\u25a0?? -. . - - &

TO BALLOT TO-MOEEOW
The members of the Mercantile Library
Association will ballot to-morrow between
the- hours of 9 a. m. and 6 p. m. and from j
7 'to 8; p. m.' upon the question of joining
with the Mechanics' Institute or the Free

The present board of trustees, most of
whom < have served for. two terms, Â«have
sent -a letter to the members of the as
sociation i strongly advising against the
continuance of the library and giving
their reasons therefor.
, The letter is as follows:
To *,tW Members of the Mercantile Library
Association: â¢
The underelsned members of the board \u25a0\u25a0 ot
trustees of the Mercantile Library Association
have, with one or two exceptions, served as
such during two successive , terms. \u25a0
They believe that they have conscientiously
studied the best interests of thÂ« institution
and have made every effort that could possibly
be. made to better its condition. They . have
.become convinced that It would be a serious
business mistake* to continue the existence of
tha library any longer than is absolutely
necessary. â¢ :. \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢-.. \u25a0:.\u25a0\u25a0..\u25a0.'.
The movement to consolidate this* library
with some other Institution was Inaugurated
by the ; members of this board In good faith.
as being for the best Interests of all conosroed.
.In the belief that it Is right that the
trustees should give the members of the as
sociation the benefit of their knowledge and
experience the undersigned take this last op
portunity of expressing their conviction that
no member of the association having tts best
Interest at heart should vote ' to continue the
library as it la. %

Those" who oppose consolidation have
issued the following letter to members:
To the .-Members of the Mercantile Library:
The . Mercantile Library waa organised - Jan
uary 24, .1853, and tha membership roll con
tains â¢ names of persons famous in the politi
cal, literary and business world. Its existence
is a: part of, the history of San Francisco. - -
This library contains approximately 80,000
volumes. It has cash in bank amounting to
|26,000* and- other property appraised at MOOO.
The- term of the lease on; the present. location
has -yet six years to run. It has no debt,
but there is annually a deficit In running ex
penses, of about *|4000. \u25a0 â¢. -
\u25a0 It ' can .readily be seen from this statement
of -fact that the members of the Mercantile
Library, may continue to enjoy Its present form
and' benefits for at. least six years to come.
There is not. therefore, any Immediate neces
sity .for- entertaining propositions to consoli
date this association with any other tnstituton.
The present board of trustees, notwithstand
ing, the above state of facts, \u25a0 has . received and
entertained such propositions from - the Free
Public Library and the Mechanics' Institute.
The offer of -the Public Library has received
little or.no consideration' and will not be> com
mented UDon in ' thl9 circular. . . - -
fid The offer of the Mechanics' - Institute. ; how
ever, has Keen* seriously entertained-- by a ma
jority of the board of trustees and by a* num
ber of : the members of : the association. : prin
cipally because of the bait thrown out by the
Mechanics^ Institute in the form of a life mem
bership. In that- institution - (valued at $50)' to
the -members of the Mercantile Library If the
two 'corporations are consolidated.
The president of I the \u25a0 Mechanics' Institute'
has admitted In a public meeting the inability
of that Institution to properly accommodate
and care "for the SO.COO volumes that, "under the
consolidation, would be received from ':\u25a0 this
library. " ; ' Had . thjs .'.admission not been made
the 'congested condition of the Mechanics' In
stitute-arid their lack of proper accommodation
for their own property must.be apparent to the
moist casual observer. ,j. . _
.It Is a - matter iof common report that the
Mechanics' Institute has \u25a0- an indebtedness
amounting to about $30,000, which ,the funds
of the Mercantile; Library would- afford the
means of canceling. . :V; \u25a0.\u25a0â¢\u25a0'â¢:<.*?
* . The undersigned committee and those whose
views. they represent are reluctant to believe
that , the trustees ,of â¢ the Mercantile Library,
now so near the end* of their, term of office,
have been "so far unmindful of or so misappre
hend, their- functions as. to encourage or favor
the offers 'which have been- made to extinguish
; the'rtbrary of which ~' they - have ' been put In
trust, whose existence it is their duty, to con
serve, not to destroy. We trust that they are
disposed strongly to maintain -the integrity \of
the library as it now exists. But should there
be *a foundation for X a contrary , belief. It Is
well to remind them - that under the . statutes
of* the. State - of : California they ' are not em
powered to dispose of- this property.
\u25a0<â¢ The -recent act of the Legislature of March
21.- 1005. (see section 658 1,. Civil Code), pro
vides that '"Two or more associations formed
and existing | under, this title (refer ; to section
653 -8, . Civil Code), or under any pre-existing
law \ authorizing their formation for* the . same
purposes, â¢ may be . consolidated, . and * for such <
purposes, 'and by such name as may be agreed
upon, writing, signed by two-thirds of the
members'of.each association.'.' \u25a0 .- \u25a0 \u25a0. -\u25a0 . .
.; The. Mechanics' Institute has Issued a circu
lar i stating " that the purpoees ; of that ; Institu
tion, are "for -the diffusion of : knowledge."
This * phrase does not appear in their " article*
of* Incorporation, and may mislead - the - un
wary.' for * the ' articles- of â¢ incorporation of j the
Mechanics' Institute expressly sute that Â» : the
purposes "are '"for * the ' promotion of mechani
cal'/ industries "j and economic- sciences," : and
their â¢" purposes are legally \u25a0 different from those
of the '.Mercantile Library as . far |as consolida
tion of "the" two*, corporations are concerned. â¢\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0' \
- This ; circular : is intended aa \u25a0 an appeal to
the" pride and J sympathy lof i the \u25a0 members ' of
the' Mercantile "Library â¢in the hope that S the
concerted I and ! programmed scheme of i the Me
chanics''lnstitute-to absorb our valuable prop
erty -and end '.the existence of our noble \u25a0 as
sociation-will be defeated. .'.-. y; ;..

WOULD CUT OFF
EARS OF SISTER
Madman Forces Whole Fami
ly to Flee From Home and
Pursues Them With Knife
ESCAPES THE OFFICERS
George lewis Terrorizes the
Town of Fruitvale by His
Wild Actions and Threats
OAKLAND, Dec. s.â Armed with a
razor and a huge carving knife and de
claring that he intended to cut off the
ears of his sister to secure her diamond
earrir.gs. George Lewis, recently divorced
from his wife, patrolled up and down in
front of the grocery of M. J. Styles
on Fruttvale avenue, where his sister,
Mre. A. L. Neumann, and her husband
and four children had taken refuge early
this morning, and only wh^n Deputy
Sheriffs Hanlfin and Reilly, who had been
summoned by telephone, arrived did he
allow bis Imprisoned relatives to escape.
When he saw the officers approaching,
Lewis, who had become crazed by over-
Indulgence In liquor, took to his heels,
and although the officers pursued him
through back yards and over fences, he
finally eluded them and made his escape.
Lewis was arrested a week ago for dis
turbing the peace of his former wife, and
Justice of the Peace Geary then gave him
a week to settle up his affairs and leave
town. The week was up to-day antf
Lewis, finding himself without money to
get out of town, Trent to the home of his
sister on Fruitvale avenue and East
Twenty-second street, and demanded that
she give him money enough to pay his
fare to some other city. Mrs. Neumann
refused, whereupon Lewis drew a razor
from his pocket and told her that unless
she produced the money he would cut
off her ears and take the diamond ear
rings and pawn them. Mre. Neumann
escaped from the room on the pretense
of getting the money, and with her hus
band and four children fled to the gro
cery.
As soon as the family were eafÂ« in the
store. Styles locked the door and barred
the windows and then turned out the
Hrhte and telephoned to the office of
Sheriff Baraet for help. In the mean
time, Lewie, finding that he had been
fooled, secured a big carving knife from
the Neumann home and. following the
family to the store, tried to force his
way into the building, to carry out his
threat to cut off the ears of his sister.
He was told that an officer had been
sent for and, thus put on his guard, fled
as soon as he saw the Deputy Sheriffs
approaching. The fugitive first took
refuge in the basement of the home of
President McCarthy of the Evergreen
Cemetery Association, but the officers
fcund him there, only to see him escape
through a front window. After con
tinuing the search for more than an hour
and finding no trace of Lewis, Hanlfin
and Reilly gave up the hunt and re
turned to Oakland. Lewis has not yet
been captured. .
JUDGE SCORES
LETTER WRITER
OAKLAND, Dec. 5. â "The man who
would attempt to influence the court's
mind by an anonymous letter Is a
scoundrel and coward," were the words
with which Judge W. H. Waste opened
the case of J. M. Thorpe vs. F. M.
Drlesbach this morning, and then an
nounced to the attorneys in the case
that he had received what was ap
parently an anonymous communication,
although it was signed "A. Wilson," In
which the plaintiff in the case was at
tacked. He then delivered himself of
a diatribe against any one who would
try to get into the mind of a Judge
matter not properly in a case.
The Judge then gave the contents of
the letter without reading it and. said:
The wrltÂ«r of this note goes on to say that
be knows the Thorpe Bros, and that they art
en thÂ« habit of getting employment in a place,
making proposals to buy an Interest In the
concern and then, after getting the .affairs In
a tangle, bringing a suit for a fictitious Inter
est In tht business. It states that they nave
done this urn* thing at Baa Jot* and hopes
that I will Bte that the plaintiff gets the pun
lÃhxne&t be deserves.
The letter was given by Judge Waste
to Thorpe, who would not allow It to
be read. Thorpe is suing Drlesbach for
an interest In the Zenith Planing Mill
and Lumber Company of East Oakland,
claiming that Driesbach had agreed, to
let him purchase a half Interest In the
concern and pay for it with his work.

OCCIDENT EDITORSHIP
SOUGHT BY TWO.
Contest -Is On Be
tween Blackman
and Gregory.
Each Has Seven of
the Fifteen Votes
to Be Cast.
BEKKELIIT, Dec 5. â A unique con
test for the distinction of acting as ed
itor-in-chief of the Occident magazine,
the foremost literary publication of the
university, is to be decided to-morrow,
when the adherents of Edward Black
man and Jackson Gregory line up at
the pol!Â« to settle the question of which
man shall dlrect N the destinies of thÂ«
periodical during" the coming college
term.
Llackman is the candidate of a fac
tion of voters that believes that poetry
and poets should be recognized in the
selection of an editor of the Occident.
Gregory is proposed by the adherents
of the plain prose section of the voters,
and he stands- for the sentiments of
thosÂ»e students who think that, merely
because a man is a poet, as is Blackman,
he should not therefore expect to bo
honored by election to the editorship
of the Occident.
Hack of the fight which Edward
Blackman is making for the place
etands Miss Katherino Hershey, wom
en's editor of the magazine, who Is an
admirer of Blackman's. poetry, and who
believes that a poet on the tripod will
give the periodical distinction and tone
of an enviable sort. Miss Hershey Is
credited with having won seven votes
fur Mr. Blackman, while seven of the
fifteen men whose votes, as directors
o the Occident Publishing Company,
will decide the matter, are for Gregory.
One man alone of the fifteen has failed
to declare himself. He is to settle the
matter when It comes to casting bal
lots.
Gregory has been managing editor of
the magazine and ordinarily would step
quietly Into the shoes of the editor-in
chief, by right of succession. It Is be
cause those who love poetry and revero
poets' havo decided that Blackman's
poetical gifts should be recognized that
Gregory's path has been rendered at all
rough on his way to the coveted goal.
Gregory was editor-in-chief of the
Blue and Gold last year, is president of
the English Club, and member of the
Winged Helmet and Golden Bear honor
societies. *
Blackman Is a member of the English
Club and at present literary editor of
the Occident and president of the Occi
dent Magazine Publishing Company.
Both men are seniors and warm friends.
DEMANDS TO KNOW
MORGAN'S BACKERS
Alameda Trustee Calls for
Close Inquiry' as to Fran
chise Applicants.
ALAMEDA, Dec. B.â Varied and general
speculation prevails with relation to the
application made to the City Trustees last
nigrjt by W. J. Morgan of San Fran*'
dsco for a franchise to lay 'a double
standard gauge railroad system on Santa
Clara avenue from San Francisco Bay at
the west end to San Leandro Bay at the
east end. There is a dearth of reliable
information aa to who are the people
back of Morgan's project.
Former Attorney General W. H. H.
Hart, who appeared l.st night In sup
port of Morgan's petition for the fran
chise, vouchsafed but â¢ little concerning
his client's standing and plans, other, than
that be was able to Install a new railroad
system here with a connecting ferry with
San Francisco, if the franchise is granted
Morgan. Hart's statement to the City
Trustees that he was not representing
any one ~on behalf of the Western Pa
cific and his further assertion that Frank
C. Havens of the Oakland Traction Con
solidated had assured him Haven's cor
poration would relinquish its ' franchise
on Santa Clara avenue' If the City. Trus
tees would grant It to Morgan leads some
to - think there is an understanding be
tween the management of the Oakland
Traction and Morgan. Speaking of mor
gan's petition for a franchise City Trus
tee Joseph Forderer said:
Before the City Trustees cun act In the mat
ter they will have to be thoroughly Informed
as to who are the . parties seeking this fran
chise and what their plans are. While I be
lieve la encouraging deserving capital and any
project that will benefit Alameda, I must first
be satisfied that there is merit . In the project.
I would oppose giving a franchise to any person
or persons for speculative purposes. -
Hart is to meet the Trustees, sitting as
a committee of the whole, on the even
ing of December 14, and it is expected
that at that time he will enlighten the
municipal legislators further as to the
plans of his client, Morgan.

SAY RUIN THREATENS
Niles Cone Country SaM to
Be in; Serious Danger
of Injury
OAKLAND, Dec. sâ Action looking tbthe
stopping of "the operations of the Spring
Valley Water Works from diverting
the waters of Alameda County was^taken
by. the Merchants' Exchange to-night by
the adoption of a resolution calling the
attention of thÂ« Board of Supervisors
and District Attorney to the facts and
also providing for special .'counsel jto aid
in the prosecution of injunction pro
ceedlngg. _ \u0084 ,
According to a report submitted by a
special committee consisting of Theodore
Gier, Wilber Walker and H. G. .Williams,
who have been at work for weeks gath
ering the necessary data, the water level,
which was five feet from the surface,
has been lowered to nearly fifty feet ii\
the Niles cone, with the result that an
area of 200.000 â¢ acrgs of land has been
made useless for orchard purposes. The
holdings of the Spring Valley. Water
Company, it ia stated, are only .43,000
acres, with .the result that a^great area
it does not own' has, befen; drained of the
necessary subterranean moisture. ' ".,
The report is exhaustive and has
ranged a vast detail of facts and figures
tending to show that the country around
Sunol, Pleasanton and the Livermore
Valley, embracing the entire Niles cone,
is In serious danger by the operation of
subterranean pumping plants '\u25a0 that are
sucking millions of gallons from .the
gravel beds of those districts. â¢ .^
At Pleasanton the company is sinking
ninety wells on the old race track
grounds, the water being pumped into
the reservoir dam in Niles canyon. The
report declares that at Dumbarton simi
lar operations are In progress and that
elsewhere within rÂ«ach of the r Niles
gravel beds immense pumping stations
are contemplated. The situation, accord
ing to the. report, is extremely grave In
that the water company contemplates in
creasing its already enormous drainage
of water out. of the county by 80,000.000
gallons daily. .

SAUSALITO. Dec. 6.â The citizens ot .
Sausalito will hold a mass-meeting in
the Town Hall on Saturday Â«veninÂ£^l
December 9, for tha purpose of discuss- *
Ins tho request of F. 11 Evanj, repre
senting the California and Inland Em
pire Railroad Company, for a franchise
to build a terminal for a new Interstate
railroad h*re. At a meeting last Wed
nesday night the recommendation of the
mess-meeting held on November 13,
favoring tha franchise with certain re
strictions and conditions.. was received
and placed- on file. Evans and hla at
torneys, W. T. Baggttt and Sheridan,
were present and spoke In behalf of
the franchise urging that It be granted
without the re.iuirement of a bond, de
claring that If the/ did not live up to
tha condition j of the franchise. thÂ«
town could have absolute control of th*
propÂ«rty.-'
The Trusteai. after hearing much dis
cussion on the matter, tef erred it to a
committee of the whole.
The Trustees apparently fait that tha
property was too valuable to dispose of
without a guarantee of good faith and
a bonus for the franchise. They did not
balieva In granting tha applicant ex
clusive rights on Railroad avenue or
tha exclusive right to tha mile of water
front to the nortn> of the avenue. Som*
of tha citizens were strongly opposed
to giving Evans tha Railroad-avenue)
waterfront, claiming that it Is too val
uable, and cited cases where munici
palities had disposed ot their water
front for a mere sons; and whan too
late saw the folly of their baste.
Tha Trustees, who all favor an In
terstate road with a \u25a0 terminal her*./|
have been looking, lnto tha matter vary '
carefully and do not desira to take any
hasty action. They beliava that a road
of this character will ba a great benefit
to the town, county and State by plac
ing them In closer communication "vlth
Eastern Oregon. Southern Idaho and
Central Wyoming 1 .
The majority of the beard will Insist
that Evans shall execute a bond of
$50,000 as a guarantee that the work
will commence on this end within a
year and pay from $75,000 to $100,000)
for the franchise with certain but
not exclusive waterfront privileges.

WILL MAKE JAPAN GO SLOWLY
Lloyd C. Griscom Back
From His Post in
Tokio.
American Minister Dis
cusses Nippon's
Future.
War Leaves the Island
Kingdom in Sore
Straits.
Lloyd C. Griscom, American Minister to
Japan, does not believe that the island
kingdom wil figure as a great commer
cial power for many years. Neither lack
of ambition nor ability will be the causes
of her slow commercial growth, but
grinding poverty will be the handicap
that will bold her back.
Minister and Mrs. Griscom arrived here
yesterday on the liner Manchuria. Gris
com is home on a leave of absence and
expects to return to Tokyo in a few
months.
He does not believe that Japan's growth
\u25a0will be much of a menace to American
trade in the Far East.
"Japan," he says, "has in the past and
will In the future cut Into our trade in
manufactured articles both in Japan and
China. She may in time shut out all the
rest of the world in certain lines on ac
count of the cheapness of her labor, but
the United States will always find in the
Orient a market for her flour and oil and
for raw material. These things the Orient
must get on the outside and the amount
of business that falls to America de
pends entirely upon the methods pursued
by the commercial interests of the United
States. .
"Japan managed her finances during
i he war in a marvelous way. Deep as
she had to sink her hand into a not too
well filled pocket, she â¢passed through the
ordeal with her credit unimpaired. There
was no depreciation in her paper money.
It was a feat to make the financial world
marvel.
"Japan Is ambitious now to develop her
self commercially, but she will have to
move very slowly. Without the assistance
of England she can do very little. With
all the outside help she is likely to ask
for, her commercial growth must be very
gradual. The late war subjected Japan
to a very severe strain, and, wonderful
people as they are, they are only hu
man."
Mr. Grit-corn denies that his relations
with the Japanese were ever anything but
the most cordial. He says there was no
foundation for the published report that
Japan had asked his Government to recall
him. He has. had absolutely no friction
with the Mikado's Government and looks
forward with pleasure to again taking
charge of the legation.
Minister Griscom says that the Japa
nese people are now reconciled to the
peace, with which he thinks they are sat
isfied. He says that Japan does not want
the Philippines and has every desire to
maintain friendly relations with the
United States. ZHe bejleves > that Japan
Tias" a future; ttiat she has no wish, In
expanding, to wort harm to any 'other
nation's trade.
Accompanying Mr. and Mrs. Griscom
was Mrs. Bronson. the Minister's mother
in-law. Minister Griscom expects to
spend most of his time during his visit
home In Philadelphia.
Among the passengers on the liner
Manchuria was one of the wealthiest mer
chants fn Japan. F. Nakamura is his
name, and he Is a member of the firm of
Masuda & Co. His firm is the selling
agent In Japan for the Standard Oil Com
pany. Nakamura Is also largely Inter
ested In the flour trade. In connection with
. which he is now visiting this country.
"As soon as Japan gets her new loan
through," he said yesterday, "she will be
all right. We are rather poor Just now.
The war cost much money. We will get
over that and will devote ourselves to
business. We expect to do a large busi
ness In Manchuria and are selling some
American products In China."

Turkish Major Gen
1 TT T?
eral Here rrom
Orient
Major General' Pertev Pasha of the
Turkish army, the only foreign military
attache wounded during the Russo-
Japanese war, arrived here yesterday
oh the Manchuria. He is on his way
to his home in Constantinople. It was
as plain Colonel Pertev that the gallant
Turk started for the front. For his
services, perhaps as balm for his
wound, the Sultan has since promoted
him to a major generalship.
General Pertev is only 33 years of
age. He speaks English with wonder
ful ease, although he modestly declares
that he Is only learning the language.
Many a voter in the United States
knows less of the' tongue of the land of
his acquired citizenship and speaks it
more unintelligibly than does this
young Turkish soldier who, a year ago,
was altogether unacquainted with Its
Intricacies.
General Pertev was before Port Ar
thur for five months and witnessed the
fall of that fortress. He saw the battle
of Mukden and most of the desultory
fighting which lasted*until peace was
declared.
It was at Liau Yang Wapeng, near
Fakumen, In a brisk little skirmish on
June 16 last that General Pertev was
wounded. The bullet passed through
bis left leg. Just above the knee. After
puncturing the general the bullet went
through his horse, which dropped dead.
None of the general's bones were
broken and the wound healed easily
under the skillful care of the Japanese
surgeons.
lOn the Manchuria General Pertev
made himself a favorite. He brought
from Port Arthur . and Manchuria a
host of Interesting reminiscences- with
which he freely regaled his fellow pas
sengers.

SITE FOR UNIVERSITY
FARM TO BE . SELECTED
Commissioners Will Render . Decision
Next Month and Not - Allow
Appropriation to Lapse.
Farmers and others of the Interior'
are impatient over the delay of the
commissioners appointed to select the
university farm site. There is ap
prehension that repeated failures to se
lect such a site as the Jaw contem
plates will result in the lapse of the
appropriation of $150,000. Dr. Benja

versity and a member of the commis
sion, said yesterday, in reply to in

Wickson, early in January, would sub

- "As soldiers the Japanese have no
superiors. Tbelr officers are the most
brilliant in the world. As custodians
of European prisoners of war the Jap

That's what William yon Wahl, lieu
tenant of one of the Czar's Cossack
regiments, thinks." He arrived here
yesterday on the Manchuria from Japan,
where, for more than a year, he was
restrained of his liberty by the Japan
ese.
Yon Wahl was on skirmish duty May
11, shortly after the battle of Yalu. He
had beensent out with a troop of his
Cossacks to establish communication
with the enemy. A Japanese bullet
through Yon Wahl's stomach told the
gallant cavalryman that he had arrived
in the enemy's territory. He was taken
prisoner and sent to Matsuyama/where
he found many of his officers.
The prisoners' camp- was In charge of
Colonel Kono, ; "the most brutal savage
that ever carried a . sword." says Yon
Wahl. Under Kono's iron rule life at Mat

TO DINE OR NOT TO DINE.
t-xERHAPS too much weight is -given to public dinners and the
\~* company one meets there. When Beaconsfield worsted Glad
*\u25a0 stone in one of their many battles and became Prime Minister,
he proposed to appoint a certain man to a post in the new Gov
ernment. A member of his party protested and told him that only
the day before the proposed appointee had dined at a Liberal club.
"Oh, well," said Beaconsfield, "a man must dine somewhere."
Just now there is what is called a strained situation here over
the annual dinner of the Merchants' Association. At these dinners
it is the haÃit to discuss public questions with great freedom. Last
year the subject was the style and quality of our city government.
The Mayor heard of this and asked for an invitation to the feast
of reason, that he might contribute to the flow of soul in defense
of his administration. The invitation was not issued, and,the Mayor
was so thoroughly basted that the roast fowl on the plates seemed
dry as a chip by comparison. One would have thought that after
that experience he would have been shy of the Merchants' Associa
tion. But it spread another banquet in honor of Secretary Taft, and
did not invite him. This was the omitted invitation that broke the
back of the Mayor's patience. He made it a political issue and the
longest chapter in his campaign book might have been headed,
"The banquets to w r hich I was not invited.'.
The people of the city sympathize with the loss of a good dinner
and sided with the Mayor. The election was well over. The trunch
eons were hung up till next time. The bucket of nails used on
campaign lies was put away. The defeated candidates again went
about the streets mourning not as those without hope, when the
time for another annual dinner by the Merchants' Association began
to get ripe, and an invitation, of the variety called "cordial," was for
warded to the Mayor. Just to show that expense does not figure in
a matter of sociability, the association also invited every candidate
elected on the Mayor's ticket. They were all bidden to the banquet
and there were no limitations about clothes. Wishbone, suits, Prince
Alberts or the workaday garments of the rialto were all permitted.
There is no doubt that the association studied to please. The
Mayor had solicited an invitation once. He had been coldly passed
by "once and had publicly complained of it. To please him, he and
all of his office holders were invited to eat the squab and fillet and
smoke the pipe of peace with the merchants. To the surprise of
everybody he and his declined, refused point blank, to break
bread and eat salt in the merchants' tent. His declination . was just
out of cold storage, too. It has not been equaled in American epis
tolary literature since Secretary of State Blame resigned in a" cube
cf ice and President Harrison accepted in another cube of the same
*ize.
The Mayor's refusal did not run to the victuals, nor the drinks,
wherewith merchants regale them, nor to the cooking. He even
admitted the symptoms of a soft spot in his official heart for the
Merchants' Association, but he objected pointedly to the president,
vice president and officers of that body, and intimated that if those
officers are retired an invitation to dinner would be thankfully ac
cepted, and he would bring his appetite and thirst and gifts of
oratory along, to do full honor td the occasion. There the incident
halts and marks time. The association has two* horses on the Mayor
and he has one on the association. It is not yet a tie. He lacks
one horse of being even. As far as the rhetoric of the affair goes
the association has the chance of another shot at him, and he cannot
even up except by sending the" police to turn out the banquet lights
and disperse the company.
*A puzzled outsider is compelled to observe that the Mayor ob
jects to the members and officers of the Merchants' Association tak
ing part against him in politics. If they had been for him, or had
kept still, he would feed with them and moisten his official clay with
their red wine. But they smote his "official hip and thigh, and pur
sued him through the heat of the day and .until the going down of
the sun, and he will have none of them. He would rather eat a
dinner of herbs in the corner of a housetop with his supporters than
partake of stalled ox with the merchants.
Now, dropping the incident out of metaphor like a balloonist
into a parachute, and getting it down to the ground again, it must
be admitted that the Mayor tried as strenuously as anybody to
butter parsnips with hard words during his campaign. As a vituper
ator he was no blacksmith. _He sowed invective and epithet broad
cast, and fell upon his enemies as did Shimei upon David.
He was about as valiant a denouncer as has appeared in
politics since the war.* If he left any base motive riot ascribed to
his opponents it must have been too small for the fine tooth comb
of his invective. Now under such circumstances why not call quits?
When a man is elected he comes under the rule noblesse oblige.
Prizefighters shake hands before a fight, gentlemen after.
INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSIONER.
THE Interstate Commerce Commission has been in operation
many years. The Pacific Coast appreciated, the importance of
the law which put interstate commerce in the control of that
bod}', and has from the beginning desired a representative in the
commission. This aspiration has not been realized until now. The
coast is the beneficiary of President Roosevelt's traverse of the" whole
Union, to acquaint himself with the wants of every part of the coun
try. He decided some time ago that the transportation interests, both
railroads and shippers, required the services and knowledge of the
local and general situation of a Commissioner located here. This
opinion has been carried out by the appointment of Mr. Franklin
K. Lane to the commission.
This appointment is satisfactory, not only because it puts a
Calif ornian in the "commission, but because Mr. Lane is an excellent
selection for the place. He is a sound lawyer, an observer, , a man
of affairs. He has had neither railroad; nor anti-railroad. affiliations,
and is equipped with an open and sober mind for the high duties of
the position to which the President has called, him. President
Roosevelt and Mr. Lane are not strangers. They are long acquainted,
and no mistake has been made in the appointment.

DREAM OF THE RAREBIT FIEND
A TALKING CROW.
George Noyes, a quarryman who re
eides at Wlnslow Mills In Waldoboro,
has* a young crow that not only can
talk, but gives indications of "a desire
to be fluent In conversation, says the
Bangor, Me., correspondent of the, New.
York World. Mr. Noyes - captured him
about a year ago and clipped his wing
and gave him to his little 'girl to play
with. The child was fond of the bird
and spent much time talking to him.
Before long it. was noticed that the
crow, in making the. unmusical creak
natural to him, plainly articulated
words he had heard often, and since
that some pains have, been taken with
his education.
He now has quite an extensive vo
cabulary, mainly words he has learned
from his little mistress.* He calls often
to "papa" and "mamma," and in ad
dressing "Goldie," the little girl, plain
ly shows that he knows that the name
belongs to her. He is beginning to
put words together as if he compre
hends their meaning. For instance,
every morning he wakes the echoes
with cries of "George." get up!" . This
crow talks better and" ; more -clearly
than most parrots and Is greatly prized

THERE are; friendsâ and friends.

A slur about. a man appears in print.
It may be true; it may be utterly false.
If it is true it will hurt the more. -The
person of whom It, was written is for

It is altogether probable that the

prompted by one. Its intention was to
wound, to injure. ' . . ;

In Just such a case.

. The income .of all the people of the
United States from all the products of

of .our Lord ,1905- was 56,n5.000,000,
and. this is something. for boasting, for
never before in ; the history of man has
the. record been equaled. .The income
of "John D. Rockefeller during the same
year was $40,000,000, according to cur
rent estimates." That 'is to say. If all
the lands of this great. nation were de
voted to the laudable purpose qf sup
plying incomes to such. men as Mr.
Rockefeller it would supply, In round
numbers, just 160 of them with pin
money. To be, sure, there mlgnt be a
one hundred and sixty-first, but he
would have td live. in the bleak, com
parative penury of $15,000,000 annually.
Do you catch the point, Willie? It-is
the combined virtue, integrity, no
bility and energy of Mr. Rockefellerâ
as all our noble \u25a0 philosophers assure
you â that has brought this beautiful
reward to Mr. Rockefeller. It Is the
embalmed trlbut* that the laws of man
pay to his extraordinary . virtues. If
Just 160 of us were as pre-eminently
good as he the, rest of us wouldn't have

vide $15,000,000: among 53.000.000 of us

It erpearÃ to many of thÂ« Alaska peo
ple that the wholesale men and transpor
tation companies of San Fr&neiseo* have
not directed their attention to the rapid
rrowth aa<3 expansion of the Alaska
trade and commerce in all of Its branches.
However, they may have given it all tha ;
rcaslCention they think It deserves and
prefer to employ their energies in ex-
the trade and commerce of San

territories of the United- States lying: to
the Westward and la the Orient. If the
atter fields are sufficient to absorb the
jslness energies of San Francisco and
Â« at late her business men's desire for
v ~siinerclal expansion and trade, then
they may ignore the Alaska field.
Eut the business men of the younger

dounded to the upbuilding of a busy.

:n a few years the metropolis of the
Pacific Coast unless the business men
and trans^rtation companies of San
Francisco awake from, their apparent
lethsisT. Not only the business men and
:^rcss of Seattle are active in the affairs
of Alaska, but the representatives cf the

Danrttl are alive to the rapidly increas

sources and the incalculable benefits that
the whole State of Washington will de

aud they are taking- an active interest tn
furthering the much needed legislation
for th;Â»* TVi-Jtorr. which lias been 6O in
excusaTsly neglected by the American
Congress.
The purchase of Alaska was char
acterized at the time' as "Seward's

bfe a country abounding in perpetual ice

that the great majority of the adult pop
ulation of the United States and a con
siderable number of those who live in
California and some of the members of
Congress are to-day imbued with the
- rr.e idea about Alaska.

tÂ« call attention to its' rapidly expanding

To-day Alaska has a permanent wttite

Some Interesting facts concerning the

Committee on Territories, from which a j
subcommittee, consisting of Senators Dll
lingham. Burnham. Nelson and Patter
son, visited Alaska during the summer of
13^3 and made a thorough examination of
existing conditions and her." resources.

sibn she has yielded in revenues to the
general Government a. sum greater by
nearly $1,000,000 than' the entire expen
diture made in her behalf."
If the Government of . the United
States was to assume the payment of
such items of expense as it does assume
and pay in all of the. Territories of the
United States, where a Territorial gov
ernment has been established, such as
the salaries of Governors, marshals,
TJnited States Judges, expenses of Unit
Â«d States courts and United States
marshals' offices, revenue steamers, cost
of collecting customs and internal rev
enues, military roads, bridges, tele
graph and cable lines, light and fog
signal stations, supplies for and educa
tion of native inhabitants (properly
wards of the general Government), all
of which have been charged to Alaska,
, as shown by the table of expenditures,
which constitute a part of the Sena
. torial report, there would stand to the
credit of Alaska, ln the Treasury of the
United States $5,000,000 derived from
the revenues- collected from the indus
tries of that great empire above the ex
penses properly chargeable to her,'
which sum in ail fairness and justice to
the inhabitants of Alaska should be
made immediately available by Con
gress for internal improvements. : It is
further stated; in this' report': that- the
nation has been enriched by the fur in
dustry of - Alaska to the extent of
JS^.OOQ.ODO; by its fisheries.-; f 50,000.000.
\u25a0jund that the output of gold since 1898
up to the time of the Senatorial visit of
1903 has been more - than 531,000,000.
which amount does not Include any
gold taken from the Dawson or Atlin
i country.
FIGURES . SHOW WEALTH.
The following statement was taken
from the monthly summary of com
merce and finance for July. J903:
"Alaska, for which the United States
paid J7.200.000 in 1867, has since that
time supplied furs. fish, and gold to
about $150,000,000 Mn value, about equal
ly dlrided. . That the investments of
capital from the United States In Alas
ka are about $25,000,000, and that the
shipments of merchandise now aggre
gate about $10,000,000 per annum." .
Since that reuort was made there has
been a marked increase in the gold.pro
duction and In the development of the
gold, copper and tin mines, and the in
crease in trade has been equally great,
incident to the Increased development.
Extensive . development , work was car
ried on daring the past mining season on
the Seward Peninsula, of which Nome is
the center. Large dredging machin**. were
constructed tn work the gravel bars of
the larger streams, some of these ma
chines having a capacity of handling 4000
cubic yards of gravel every twenty-four
hours. There was during the saxae sea
son about sixty miles of ditch, of large
capacity, constructed for hydraulic min
ing purposes, and - a greater number of
miles of ditch have been surveyed to be
built next season in that immediate vicin
ity; there are also two . proposed ditch
lines 'that have been surveyed to be con
structed next season in . the - Fairnaven
precinct, which lies north. of Nome, each
about forty, miles in length; the estl-.
mated cost ef both ditches being $750,000.
About seventy-five miles of railroad will
be built next year from Nome and Port
Clarence into the interior to meet the de~
mands for better transportation facili
ties from tha seaboard to the different
mining . camps and settlements on the
Seward Peninsula. Extensive railroad
building is now being carried on along
the southern coast. The Alaska Central
Railroad, starting from Seward, will con
nect the southern coast with the great
Yukon River via Fairbanks. About sixty
miles of this route are completed, and
there are now employed in its" further !
construction about 2000 men. This road
will open up a vast country. . rlch*in gold
and copper, -the Fairbanks district alone
yielding â¢ $7,000,000 ln gold last year, t and
will render accessible extensive agricul
tural valleys, well watered and timbered ',
and equaled tn extent to the satire agri
cultural area of California: The Copper
Mountain and Northwestern Railroad will
bÂ« under active construction next season
from Valdez to the Yukon River and about
GOO miles eastward of the Alaska Central.
I This road will reach the enormous de
posits of copper in the Interior, and 1 like
wtoe crMEes great fertile valleys' capable
of sustaining: many . thousand ' farmers,
wno will surely follow the .'miners In
i Alaska the ' sazoe as they did in Califor
nia and the great \u25a0 mining States \u25a0 and
Territories of- the West. In view of. these
extensive enterprise* to be carried on dur
ing next "year^ and the increased activity
in the - development : of the mining Indus
try, It - 1* .conservatively; estimated "r that
the Alaska trade" with the United States j
will .reach the- I SS,WQ#Â»-tnark during the I
next year. . The completion of -these rail- I
roads . wisr furnish shipping: facilities - for.
the apparently inexhaustible copper ore
which is . found throughout ;" that â¢ portion
cf Alaska and the amount that * will :. be
ultimately shipped will : only _ be ;. limited
by ' th* - world's demand - for - that i metal.
They will; also greatly facilitate the ex
ploration \u25a0; aniT development of. the \u25a0 exten
sive coal and oil fields . of that . section. : ;
SHIPMEATS ARE HEAVT.
During the" : nine t, months ending ; Sep^
tember, 1905, ' shipments ' of domestic'mer
chandise'from the United States to Alas
ka amounted to $11,276,010; of which there
was shipped from ' Seattle ; $9,177,713, \ f rom

to Porto Rico $10,978,528, â¢ to the Philip

It will therefore be observed that the
shipment ' of domestic ' merchandise from
the United States to Alaska exceed -In
value by nearly one million dollars dur
ing the last nine months that which* was
shipped to any of the other non-contigu
ous territories *of the United States.
â¢* Since July, 1597, more than one hundred
and twenty-five million dollars. In gold 1
has been received in Seattle from Alaska
and the Canadian districts of Dawson and
Atlin. More than one . hundred \ millions
of this amount passed through the United
States assay* office at that : place, and a
great bulk of It was spent therel - â¢
The energetic business men "of Seattle
are thoroughly j alive to the ' Importance
and value of the Alaska trade ' and com-,
merce and are putting forth every : effort
to promote Its growth and retain. it The
â¢flfteen-story'Alaskan building at the cor
ner of Second avenue and Cherry street,'
the highest business block on the Pacific
Coast, in which the Alaska Club, a busi
ness mÂ«n's association/ has large and
commodious quarters and where all Alas
kans are made welcome/ the 'new Stander
Hotel and several other large. and impos
ing business blocks testify to the j rapid
growth of Seattle, and all of them are
the results of the benefits derived by
that city, from its trade with Alaska.
There is another Important factor to be
considered in conection with the Alaska
trade. Travel naturally follows the- course
of trade and commerce. In a word, peo
ple go where they . trade, v Nearly five
thousand people embark for Nome from
Seattle each spring and < return there
again in the fall, and for several .weeks
prior to leaving . for the \u25a0 north \u25a0 and j upon
their, return they throng the hotels ? of
that : city and spend hundreds of ~ thou
sands of dollars. Other thousands <<enfcu
bark by \u25a0 different lines of steamers '-. tfa
Seward, Valdez and other points along
the southern coast of Alaska,- and .yet
other thousands annually travel the
greatest and .most picturesque waterway
on the face of the earth," ; that threads
it 3 way along toe southeastern" coast of
Alaska to Juneau. ', Tread well, Skagway
and many other small tbwns^ahd settle
ments, each one of which is annually in
creasing, its trade with Seattle.,
PnOSPECTS ARE GOOD.
\u25a0'.[ As above . stated. It* is conservatively
estimated that the trade : with Alaska
will reach the $25,000,000 mark during
the coming year, and that in ten years
it will have passed ' the- $100,000,000
mark annually, '"arid the ; large fleet of
vessels now plying between Seattleand
the different points along the' Alaskan
coast will be Increased accordingly, un

. :.Ott*made t 'a" statement on his arrival
here that the $1100 had been placed by
him a shoeblacking bottle and se
creted in a woodshed: in the yard .of
Deputy Marshal Jordan's" house ' at~ Al

Thomas McMillin. Chief of Police there,
and a * reply was received ; on Monday
night; as follows: "No .dog house on
Jordan's place. Have dug up ground in

Yesterday Ott made a further con
fession to Detectives Bunfcer and Freel.
He said that' the currency was placed
in the shoeblacking bottle, and he and
Jordan -went. into the shed, in Jordan's
yard and in corner where there was
a , piece of canvas or '.*-. cloth mailed
against the -wall, 'forming -a triangle

covered it "up. Ott gaid Jordan told
him that the bottle would remain there
until Ott returned for/ it. Ott added
that the reason he had not made this

Loudly When Indignation
Overcomes Her Judgment
ADJOURNMENT TAKEN
Exciting Scene Takes Mmd
of Jury. Judge and Counsel
From the Issues of Ose
Wild hysteria on the part of Miss Â£eÂ»' c
T Henry, who is suing Millionaire W. F.
Whittier for 550.000 damages for breach of
promise, brought the trial of the case to
a eudden adjournment yesterday after
r.oon. Walter J. Weatherly. secretary for
Mr Wbittier, was on the stand testifying
he to how Miss HÂ«nry had pursued Whlt
ticr and how he had been"* frequently
called upon to drive her from Whittler's
place of business and finally to call In the
police to place her under arrest.
"We could not get rid of her," testified
Weatherly. "She haunted the place and
said she had come to see "Whlttler and
demand that he pay her the price of her
ellence. She said he would 'have to do
business' as she dictated or go to court."
With a err of race. Miss Henry rose
from her seat and with shouts of "I
can't, r won't stand this vilification,"
began to scream at the top of her voice.
The remainder of the Henry family that
had gathered to give their testimony and
lend their moral support to her claim
joined her In a chorus of walls and for a
moment bedlam was let loose. The bailiff
and friends finally dragged Miss Henry
into the corridor. An adjournment until
this morning was then ordered.
Miss Henry, who is a masseur, was
elaborately gowned for her second ap
pearance in court yesterday. From be
neath her short, black rain skirt there
peered a pair of feet, snugly booted in
strapped and beaded high-heeled recep
tion slippers. A glimpse of a well de
veloped arm was noticeable where the
long white gloves failed to reach the
short lace sleeves of her shirt waist. A
picture hat, wound round with an auto
mobile veil, completed the costume, de
eigned to impress the jury more fully as
to the extent of all that Whittier in
reality lost when he cast the plaintiff
aside.
One of the first moves of the plaintiff
when the hearing was resumed before
Judge Buck of San Mateo. sitting in
Judge Sloss* department of the Superior
Court, was to call Whittier to the stand
to prove the contention that he is rolling
in wealth.
"We will admit that Mr. 'Whittier la
worth enough to meet any judgment this
plaintiff may obtain against him." said
Attorney T. C. Van Ness, chief counsel
for the defendant.
"How much will you admit he is
worth?" asked Attorney Whinnered who
represents the plaintiff.
"Oh. a million dollars or so," said Van
Ness with a yawn. ' â¢
"We will show that he is worth twice
that sum if given the chance," retorted
Whitroore.
"The admission of the defendant is
ample for all purposes of this case," said.
Judge Buck, "and further questioning
along these lines will not be permitted."
The family of the plaintiff had its
inning on the stand, each testifying to
the incidents in the alleged courtship of
masseur by millionaire. Edward Wllley.
a nephew, and Mrs. Josie Latimer, Mrs.
Annie Pomisel and Mrs. Mamie Vayola.
pisters of the plaintiff, lent her their aid.
The defense will open to-day.

Matter Street Road.
Relative to the request of the Board
of Supervisors for an opinion as to
whether the board has the power to
grant the petition of the United Railroads
to change the motive power of its Sut
ter, Larkin and Polk street systems from
a cable system to an electric system
\u25a0without granting a new franchise. City
Attorney Long yesterday referred to an
opinion rendered by his predecessor in
ufilce as follows:
In view cf the provisions of thÂ« charter
(ranting power to regulate meet railroads and
the uae of the streets, there can be little
doubt that the Board of Supervisors has
power. If It Â»ees fit. to J grant the privilege
her* sought.
As the matter stands now, the United
Railroads desires to build an overhead
electric system, but the property owners
along the line of the roads insist on an
Underground conduit system. Another
meeting of the Joint Supervisors* Street
tnd Finance Committee will be called
shortly to settle the matter.

SWEARS WIFE
STILL LIVES
Witness Curran Declares
Collins Charlotta
and Xot Agnes Newman
COUBT KEBUKES COUNSEL
Bequests Both Sides to Cease
Bickerings and Threatens
to Punish the Defendant
"When Judge aiurasky informed me
of the death of Collins' wife I had b
delicacy about condollog: with Collins,
because I knew that hU wife was not
dead."
This was the direct statement of
Thomas E. Curran yesterday on the
witness stand In Judge Lennon'a court
room, after he had described the al
leged wedding of Charlotta Newman
Collins and the defendant, at which he
acted as groomsman. Judge Lennon
thereupon questioned the witness re- i
garding the marriage and his'answers
showed that his recollection of the
event was rather olouded.
The principal feature of the session
was the aggressive manner in which
Collins plied the witnesses with ques
tions and placed his objections before
the court. Several times during, the
forenoon Judge Lennon rebuked the de
fendant and one time threatened him
with punishment for contempt. The
court also censured the attorneys for
the prosecution.
The prosecution attempted by the
testimony of Curran", . Dr. Adolph H.
Kahn and Henry B. Newman to prove
that Collins and Charlotta Newman
were married and that Collins intro
duced the woman as his wife. Collins
objected to the questions on the
ground that the prosecution in Its
opening argument limited Itself to,
proving his marriage with Charlotta by
ceremony and not by repute or intro
duction.
The prosecution claimed the right to
combine the two methods and the ques
tions were admitted, with *a reserva
tion by Judge Lennon that they shall
be stricken from the record if found
to be improper upon his Inquiry Into
the authorities.
After the . testimony of Curran, Dr.
Kahn of Xapa, who attended the birth
of the children at the Collins home,
took the stand and told of his visits to
the residence. He is certain that he
attended Charlotta Collins and not
Agnes, but could give no positive de
scription of difference In the appear
ance of the two sisters. He asserted
that be believed Agnes to have been
the larger of the two.
Henry B. Newman was the last wit
ness of the day and told of his only
recollection of the I marriage service,
that the priest had pronounced his sister
Charlotta and George D. Collins "man
'and wife." Those three words are the
only ones he remembers, as he was 12
years old at the time. The three words
in sequence, "man and wife," do not
occur in the Roman Catholic marriage
ceremony, said Collins.' Newman cpuld
not swear that his sister had. given
birth to a child and did not remember'
Collins speaking about the fact. -
An adjournment was taken until 10
o'clock to-day.
DE HATES PLACES BLAME
FOR CONFUSING THE JURY
Covert Reply of Court to . Reported
Strictures of Treasury Solicitor
In the Ungfr Cases. ;
While the trial of Cress Unger was
in progress yesterday in the United
States District Court, Judge de. Haven,
with a significant glance at counsel,
'remarked that during the two former
trials much. Irrelevant evidence had
been admitted that tended only to con
fuse the jury and obscure- the case.
The Judge added that he would have
ruled out such evidence if any j objec
tions -had been niade, but 1 that no ob
jections having .been heard the evi
dence was allowed to come in. .
The witnesses examined yesterday
were Frederick. S. Stratton, Collector of
the Port; Special Deputy William B.
Hamilton, Chicf 1 Clerk Henry' Farmer
and Assistant Postmaster" Hull Mc-
Claughry. Nothing new was elicited.
Unger*s wife and little boy and girl
sat behind him during the trial.' The
case will be resumed to-day.

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, WEDNESDAY, "DECEMBER 6, jvlOOa! 1
RUSSIAN NOBILITY AIRED
IN A POLICE COURT.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"We're from St. Petersburg," said the
j Count Dolgourouki, speaking for himself
and wife, to Police Judge Conlan.
"And at this critical oerlod in that same
St Petersburg it is a very . good ? place
for titled arlstocraoy to be from," auoth
his Honor,' quite pleasantly. - "\u25a0\u25a0" '-. \u25a0
"Ah, yes," the Count gravely rejoined;
"St. Petersburg is ; the very" unhappy
place.- Our little chicken farm ' at Fruit
vale is the much-to-be-pref erred home."
"Ah, indeed, yes," smilingly concurred
the Countess. "On that* small chicken
farm I very contented am." . . .
But the testimony for % the prosecution
of the Count and CoÂ«ntess did nottend to
bolster her claim of complete content
with life' at Frultvale.- They were
charged with having disturbed" the peace,
and- the evidence went; to show that "it
was the lady's resistance of her husband's
endeavor to compel her return "to the
chicken ranch that led to their arrest. ;
Among the humble acquaintances of the
Countess is a ; Mrs. Shannon, who j dwells
on Ritch' street, between Bryant and
Brannan, and' on Monday morning.the. the
Countess left, her â¢ noble husband .and
feathered treasures and crossed the bay
to visit Mrs. Shannon. So protracted was
her . absence that the Count finally fol-.
lowed her to the house of Shannon, where
he found her exchanging gossip with the
chatelaine * and imbibing liquid : stimu
lants. Shocked by his ; consort's volun
tary abandonment of dignity befitting, her
title" and station, he angrily commanded
her. to accompany him back jto the fowl
farm, but she firmly declined to do \so.
in which revolutionary procedure she was
enthusiastically aided and abetted by her
hostess. â¢ â¢ " '.\u25a0 .\u25a0.: \u25a0' " ; ,
"While husbands " may be allowed to
bully-rag their wives in Russia," the ex
cellent matron Is ! reported |to j have said,
"thank goodness, they . can't .cut ' no such
didoes and get away with 'em in this
country." ' - -\u25a0 '\u25a0.â¢'; â¢ â¢ .
When the Count grasped an arm of the
Countess with ' intent to j enforce \u25a0 his corn-,
mand, her other arm was grasped by/ Mrs.
Shannon, and the' lady was being vigor
ously pulled \u25a0 and ' hauled by. the contest-"
ants for' possession,- when" a -.policeman
stopped the tug-of-war and â¢ arrested^the
Count and his spouse. :. The Judge -dli^*
missed the complaints. *. j" 1%
. The Count's right to his title waa : in^
cidentally ft questioned | lniÂ». court, 1' but 'he
produced documents ' to prove It, and '\u25a0 they
were honored.' He was not exiled from his
native Russia, he declared;, nor .was he
Impelled to leave it by, f ear of the revo
lutionists, as '\u25a0' the nation ] was compara
tively placid . when^ he 'decided that the
raising of hens in America would be a
more secure, if less exciting, career than
that of herding serfs ' in the. land of \u25a0 his
fathers. Hence : his ; emigration. \u25a0 â¢
The Countess seemed to >regard the
court proceeding In the light of a Joke,
for she alternated smiles and .giggles
until the Judge .'threatened -to commit
her for contempt if she did not display
more decorum. Then she smothered
her ebullitions of mirth in a dainty
handkerchief. ; .' .' ; ; . ' .;.'
Asldo from their â¢, title,; there was
nothing strikingly/ indicative of aris-.
tocracy about:" the ' DolgOurouskls.*
The Countess.^ aged about " 50, was mod
estly garbed and wore glasses; arid ' the
Count; about; five :: years ', her /\u25a0senior,'
, would pass i muster - ; anywhere , â¢ as '. a
small* shopkeeper. 'Â»â¢
J. M. Estrada of 1420%; Powell street
was shaking dice | for drinks with some
friends in a saloon at/: 1500. 1 Powell
street,, when an apparently 'intoxicated
stranger j lounging, at the bar affection
ately, hugged him and pronounced him
a good fellow. When the ; Intrusive in
ebriate was shaken off â¢he - disappeared
and soon afterward Mr. Estrada dis
covered that' his ; .watch ;/and chain,
valued at $70, was also missing. Sus
picion, of course,^ Instantly ; attached" to
the departed | embracer and | a 'â¢' descrip
tion of * him ' was - furnished I to . a police
man, who arrested one Incas Gonzalea
as the person' wanted, and Air. Estrada
identified the prisoner as the man who
had hugged him. .' " . -
- When ; the" case 'was on in . Judge Mo
gan'i - court ' the '* missing V. watch and

JONES TELLS
OF WILD TIME
States Senator
Relates Ho^r John Flem
ming Bluifed Out Neviils
REFERS TO HIS WEAIiTH
Venerable Nevadan Says That
He Once Had More Money
than He Could Count
Tha yÂ«arÂ» weigh heavily upon ex-United
States Senator John P. Joriea, s :;yet 'hi*
recollections of his achievement* In the
world \u25a0 of : finance and etatesmanshlp ; are
unclouded. : This : fact , was ' demonstrated
yesterday , s , '; when he -\u25a0 : appeared before
Judge ! Muraaky to testify. In the suit â¢ in
stituteu by him .and. William VA.
NevUls against John ; and William Flem
ming and . the - heirs :of , the . late .William
Nichols to recover 1160.000," alleged to be
due on; a 'contract 'for the; purchase of
one-half of ft the stock rin the Amador
Tunnel, Milling .and , Mining i Company. c ;
I Asked why jg it was y that â¢ some of the
details of the transactions Involving the
agreement In Issue had 'escaped his mln4
the venerable \ Senator - said: ' >
; ."They have escaped my nilnd because .1
paid" no ' attention : .to I them -at the time.
My '.only ; interest In' the - transaction { here
Involved i amounted to ; but $30,000, and then
I \ paid " no attention \to ( that.' Why, I \ had
so ; much . money then * that I . could not
count it; so I told , Nevllls that . anything
he thought was right was right He pre
pared the papers, asked me to sign them
and I did.",. ;.
It |is the contention of â¢ Senator Jones
and. Nevllls that it was the refusal of the
defendants/ especially. Flemmlng, now de
ceased,; to agree to; the j le^T^ing of an as
sessment-on the â¢ stock ; to raise money for
development f work . and to build a mill
that necessitated \u25a0 the | shutting down of
the properties ;of the company. The
means adopted X by s Flemming to prevent
the \ levying tof 5 this were
graphically described Iby Senator Jones: !
"It \was \u25a0':\u25a0. back '\u25a0 in the early days," , he
said, "when we were \ called jto a , meeting
to be held at;the offices of the company
at, Montgomery ;and "California streets. I
was late : in; arriving, and X Just as I 'en
tered the room ; Plemming engaged in a
row r with; Nevllls. 1 ; :. ; : .'. "
"Blemming \ was | a very sick man and
physically? no match \u25a0 for , Nevllls, but the
fact \ that he kept, his \u25a0: right ; hand In his
pocket convinced me that he would shoot
if the , occasion < arose. He ; called ' Nevllls
the most 'extraordinary: names and con-,
eluded by. saying: .' 'I will kill you if you'
fool wi th ; me any . more.'
"Seeing that .there was no possible
chance', of "reaching/ an "agreement, with
Flemming cursing and -swearing at Nev
llls,' I* got 'between 'the men and finally
induced r Nevllls,- to ; go into the corridor
with' me. :'; l 'went 'back into the room,
and ; ", the .adjourned without
action."^ ; ... " \ .' . :,' ;
% Senator Johes^ then told" of the efforts
mailed by^Ne'villar' to sell the mine In' Lo
ndon, and of the refusal* of the defendants
to^treat Vith 1 - him 'in 'furtherance of this
plan. :', He jtidehtlfledj.th*ej agreements ' upon
which V the A suit .. was 'instituted ,and was

Shortly after, she had beenawakened

Isaac " W. Raphael, i yesterday mornlns,
Mrs. Louisa Raphael. was found uncon
scious In her room from the effect! of
carbolic acid- poisoning.. She died Just
an. hour before; the time set for the

It is supposed that she ; swallowed the
acid, mistaking lt:for cough " medicine.
! Mrs. Raphael had been ' nursing her
husband ; ~ through ' a 's long illness, .- and
the'ishock ;of ; his death nearly -pros
trated her. 'She had been going almost
without sleep for.- many nights, end the
theory of the. mistake seems logical.
The ' bottle containing the poison . and
the one that? held the cough ; medicine
were similar : In size : and shape. Mrs.
Raphael reached for the 'medicine In a
dimly, lighted room and took the bottle
of poison Instead. She poured -, out a
tablespoonful and drank It. When help
reached her she : was unconscious. ;
Dr.VM.' R- 'â¢ Gibbons was .; summoned
immediately,' but .when he reached the
Raphael home. 1 705. Gough street, MrÂ«.
Raphael : was beyond ; medical aid. A

WASHINGTON. Dec. 5. â ThÂ« Presi
dent to-day sent the following mes
sage to Congress:
Jo the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives:
The people of this country continue
to enjoy great prosperity. Lndoubted
lj there will be ebb and flow In such
prosperity, and this ebb and flow will
be felt morÂ« or less by all members of
the community, both by the deserving
and the undeserving. Against the
wrath of the Lord the wisdom of man
citiinot avail: in times of flood or
drought human ingenuity can but par
tially repair the disaster. A general
failure of crops would hurt all of us.
Again, if the folly of man mars the
general well-being, then those who are
innoi"Â»"Â» Qf. tbjÂ».*oliy will -have to pay
pÂ»rt of the penalty^incurred by thosÂ«
who are guilty of the' folly. A panic
brought on by the speculative folly of
part of the business community would
hurt the whole business community.
But such stoppage of welfare, though
It might be severe, would not be last
leg. In the long run the one vital
factor in the permanent prosperity of
the country, is the high individual
character of the average American
\u25a0worker, the average American citizen,
no matter whether his work be men
tal or manual, whether he be farmer or
wage-worker, business or professional
man.
In our industrial and social system
the interests of all men are so closely
Jnurtwined that in the immense ma
jority of cases a straight-dealing man
who, br his efficiency, by his ingenuity
end industry, benefits himself must also
benciit others. Normally the man of
great productive capacity, who be
comes rich by guiding the labor of
many other men, does so by enabling
them to produce more than they could
produce without his guidance, and both
he and they share In the benefit, \u25a0which
comes also to the public at large. The
superficial fact that the sharing may
be unequal must never blind us to the
underlying fact that there is this shar
ing, and that the benefit comes in some
<Jegree to each man concerned.
Normally the wage-worker, the man
cf small means and the average con
sumer, as well as the average pro
ducer, are all alike helped by making
conditions such that the man of ex
ceptional business ability receives an
exceptional reward for his ability.
Something can be done by legislation
to help the general prosperity, but no
ruch help of a permanently beneficial
character can be given to the less able
end less fortunate, save as the re
cults of a policy which shall inure to
the advantage of all industries and
efficient people who act decently; and
this is only another way of saying that
any benefit which comes to the less
able and less fortunate much of neces
elty come even more to the more able
And more fortunate. If. therefore, the
Irss fortunate man is moved by envy
of his more fortunate w brother to
strike at the conditions under which
they have both, though unequally, pros
pered, the result will assuredly be that
while damage may come to the one
struck af; it will visit with an even
heavier load the one who strikes the
blow. Taken as a whole, we must all
go up or go down together. .
GOVERNMENT CONTROL
OF BIG CORPORATIONS
Only Means by Which the Pre
vailing Abuses Can Be .
Stopped.
Yet. while not merely admitting but
Insisting upon this. It is also true that
where there Is no governmental re-
Etralnt or supervision some of the ex
ceptional men use their energies not in
ways that are for the common good,
but in ways which tell against thin
common good. The fortunes amassed
through corporate organization are now
so large, and vest such power In those
that wield them, as-to make it a mat
ter of necessity to give to the sover
eign â that Is, to the Government, which
represents the people aa a whole
some effective power of supervision
over their corporate use. In order to
insure a healthy social and industrial
life, every big corporation â¢ should bo
held responsible by, and be accountable
to. some sovereign strong enough to
control Its conduct,
I am in no cense .hostile to corpora
tions. This is an age of combination,
and any effort to prevent all combina
tion will be not only useless, but - in
the end vicious, because, of the con
tempt for law which the. failure Â«to en
force law. inevitably, produces. We
should, moreover, recognize in , cordial
and ample fashion the immense good
effected by corporate agencies in * a
country such as ours, and the.M'ealth Of
intellect," energy and fidelity.: devoted
to their service, and therefore normally
to the service of the public, by 'their
officers and directors.' The 'corporation
ihas come > to ; stay, Just as,:the| trade
jVunion has come. to stay. Each; can- do
|^^n<l has done great grood. Eaeh:should
. â¢oh favored as long:. as it does good. -But
each should be sharply checked where
it acts against law, and justice, : -

deal begins to approach in importance
the matter of endeavoring to secure
proper industrial conditions under
which the Individuals â and especially
the great corporationsâ doing an inter
state business are to act. The makers
of our national constitution provided
especially that the regulation of inter
state commerce should come within
the sphere of the General Government.
The arguments In favor of their taking
this stand were even then overwhelm
i ing. But they are far stronger to
day, in view of the enormous develop
ment â¢of great business agencies, usu
ally corporate in form.
Experience has shown conclusively
that it is useless to. try to get any ade
! quate reflation -rand -supervision- of
these great corporations : by State fac
tion. Such regulation and supervision
can only be effectively exercised by - a
sovereign ---whose â -jurisdiction- is . -co
extensive with the field of work of the
corporation â that is. by the National
Government. I believe that this regula
tion and supervision can be obtained
by the enactment of laws by the Con
gress. ' If this proves impossible, it will
certainly be necessary ultimately to
confer In fullest form such power upon
the National Government by a proper
amendment of the constitution.
It would obviously be unwise to en
deavor to secure such an amendment
until it is certain that the result can
not be obtained under the constitution
as it now is. The laws of the Con
gress and of the several States hither
to, as "passed upon by the courts, have
resulted more often In showing that
the States have no power in the matter
than that the National Government has
power; so that there at present exists
a very unfortunate condition of things,
under which these great corporations
doing an interstate business occupy
the position of subjects without a sov
ereign, neither any State government
nor the National Government having
effective control over them. Our
steady aim should be by legislation,
cautiously and caVefully undertaken,
but .resolutely persevered in, to assert
the sovereignty of the National Govern
ment by affirmative action. .*
This is only in form an innovation.
In substance it is merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regu
lation of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies; and all that I propose
is to meet the changed conditions in
such manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power It
has always possessed, not only in this
country, but also in England before and
since this country became a separate
nation.
EVASIONS OF THE LAW
Evil Checked In One Place Springs
Up In Another.
It has been a misfortune that. the na
tional laws on this subject have hither
to been of a negative or- prohibitive
rather than an affirmative kind.-, and
still more that they have in part sought
to prohibit what could hot be effective
ly prohibited, and have in part in their
prohibitions confounded what should be
allowed and what should not be al
lowed. It is generally useless -to try
to prohibit all restraint on competition,
whether this restraint be reasonable or
unreasonable; and where It is notruse
lops it is generally hurtful: \u25a0â¢"; Events
have shown that it is not possible ade
quately ot- secure the enforcement of
quately to secure the enforcement of
peal to the courts.
The Department of Justice-has for' the
last four years devoted more attention
to the enforcement of the anti-trust
legislation' than to anything else. \u25a0â¢\u25a0
Much has been accomplished; particu
larly marked has been the moral effect
ot the prosecutions;; but It is increas
ingly evident that there will be a very
insufficient beneficial result In the way
of economic change. The ' successful
prosecution of one device to evade the
law Immediately develops another de
vice 'to accomplish " the same purpose
What is needed Is not sweeping pro
hibition of every arrangement, good or
bad, which may tend to restrict compe
tition, but such adequate supervision
and regulation as will prevent any re
striction of competition from beine
to the detriment of the public â as well
as such supervision' and regulation -as
will prevent 'other abuses; in no way
connected with restriction of competi
tion.
Of these abuses perhaps the chief,- al
though by no means the only, one, is
overcapitalization â generally, itself the
result of dishonest promotionâbe
cause of the myriad evils it brings- In
in its train; for such overcapitaliza
tion often means an inflation that " in
vites business panic; it always . con
ceals the true: relation * of - the profit
earned to the ' capital actually . invested
and it creates a burden of interest

improper reduction ;in or > limitation of

PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE MESSAGE
{Regulation of {Railroad iftates
The President's message recommends national super
vision of corporations, and calls for action by Congress on
the control" of insurance companies, State authority having
proved inadequate. The President again advises Federal
regulation of railway rates, proposing that the powers of the
Interstate Commerce Commission be greatly increased.
System of 7)uai Uarffif Schedule
'- ' The message is very brief on the tariff question. Con
" gress is asked to- consider the dual tariff system, the minimum
and maximum schedules to operate to "secure a certain re
ciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves."
iPubltctti/in Campaign J'uncis
'^ Full publicity is urged in regard, to campaign contribu
tions. It is also proposed that contributions by corporations,
for any political purpose be forbidden by law.

The desire of this nation for peace; is set forth in the
\ message, but a warning is raised against disarming, which
would remove the' bonds that hold lawlessness in check
among the less civilized countries. The new obligations of
the Monroe doctrine must be assumed, says the President, and
have already been undertaken in the case of Santo Domingo
with excellent results.
Changes in the immigration Ju aw a
Radical changes in the immigration laws are proposed in
order to prevent the entrance of undesirables from Europe.
The President stands for the strict exclusion of. Chinese
coolies, but urges better treatment for the exempt classes.

* The- big railroad men and big ship
pers are simply Americans of the or
dinary, type, who have developed to an
vxtraordinary degree certain great bus
iness qualities. They are neither better
nor worse than their fellow citizens of.
smaller means. Th*y are merely more
able in certain lines and therefore ex
posed to certain peculiarly strong
temptations. - These temptations have
not sprung newly into being; the ex
ceptionally successful among mankind
have always been exposed to them; but
they have grown amazingly in power
as a result of the extraordinary de
velopment-of Industrialism along new
lines, and under these new conditions,
which the lawmakers of old could not
foresee and therefore could not provide
against, they have become so serious
and menacing as to demand entirely
new remedies.
It is In the Interest of the best type
of railroad man and the best "type of
shipper no les^s than of the public that
there should be. governmental super
vision ' and regulation of these great
business ' operations, for the same rea
son that it is in the interest of the
corporation which wishes to treat its
employes aright . that there should bo
an effective employers* liability act,
or an effective .system, of factory* laws
to prevent the abuse of women and
children. All such legislation frees thÂ»

TRUSTS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO WIEL
National Regulation of Railway Rates.
In my judgment the most important provision which such law. (railway rate) i should contain is that confer^g upon some com
petent administrative body the power to decide upon the case being brought before it,-. whether a given rate â¢prescribed by a
railroad is reasonable and just, and if it is found to be unreasonable -and unjust^ then, after full investigation of the complaint,; to
prescribe the limit of the rate beyond which it shall not be lawful .to go-â the maximum reasonable rate; -.as '-.'..'it 'l is dommohiy
called â this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts.
It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate is too 'high, but that a , favored .'shipper is given too low a rate. In 'such cases
the commission would have the right to fix this already established minimum -rate^as" the maxunum; r
one or two such decisions by the commission to cure railroad companies of the practice , of giving improper minimum rates, I call
your attention to the fact that my proposal is not to give the commission power to initiate or originate rates generaliy, but to
regulate a rate already fixed or originated by the roads, upon complaint and investigation. Jl heavy penalty should be enacted
from any corporation which fails to respect an order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum' rate as
being essential to any scheme of real reform in the^matter of railway regulation. The first necessity is sto; secure it; and unless
it is granted to the commission there is little use in touching the subject at aIL \ . |^||1|
Continued from Pajre 11.
The opponents of Government regu
lation dwell upon the difficulties to be
encountered and the Intricate and in
volved nature of the problem. Their
contention is true. It is a complicated
and delicate problem, and all kinds of
difficulties are sure to arise in connec
tion with any plan of solution, while no
plan will bring all the benefits hoped
for by Its more optimistic adherents.
Moreover, under any healthy plan, the
benefits will develop gradually and not
rapidly. Finally, we must. clearly un
derstand that the public servants who
are to do this peculiarly responsible
and delicate work must themselves be
of the highest type both as regards in
tegrity and efficiency. They must be
well paid, for otherwise able men con
not in the long run be Eecured; and
they must possess a lofty probity which
will revolt as quickly at the thought
of pandering to any gust of populai
prejudice against rich men as at the.
thought of anything even remotely re
sembling subserviency to rich men.
But while I fully admit the difficul
ties In the way, I do not for a moment
admit that these difficulties warrant
us in stopping in our effort to secure
a wise and Just system. They should
have no other effect than to spur us on
to the exercise of the resolution, the
even-handed Justice, and the fertility
of resource, which wÂ« like to think of
as typically American, and which will
in the end achieve good results In this
as in other fields of activity. The task
111 a- great one and underlies the task
of dealing with" the whole industrial
iroblem. But the fact that It is a great
problem does not warrant us In shrink
ing from the attempt to solve it.
At present we face such utter lack
of supervision, such freedom from the
restraints of law, that excellent men
have often been literally forced Into
doing what they deplored because oth
erwise they were left at the mercy of
unscrupulous competitors. To rail at
and assail the men who have done as
they best could under such conditions
accomplishes little. What we need to
do is to develop an orderly system; and
such a fvstem can only come through
the gradually increased exercise of the
right of efficient Government control.
MEASURES FOR SAFETY.
Block Signals and Limited Hours of
Work for Employe*.
In my annual message to the Fifty
eighth Congress, at its third session. 1
called attention to the necessity for
legislation requiring the use of block
signals upon railroads engaged in Inter
state commerce. The number of serious
collisions upon unblocked . roads that
have occurred within the past year adds
force to the recommendation then made.
The Congress should provide, by appro
priate legislation, for the introduction
of block signals upon all railroads en
gaged in .interstate commerce at the
earliest practicable date, as a measure
of increased eafety to the traveling
public
Through decisions of the Supreme
Court of the United States and the
lower Federal courts In cases brought
before them for adjudication the safe
ty-appliance law has been materially
svrengthened, and the Government has
been enabled to secure Its effective en
forcement in almost all cases, with the
result that the condition of railroad
equipment throughout the country 1*
much improved and railroad employes
perf orm their duties under safer condi
tions than heretofore. The Govern
ment's most effective aid In arriving at
this result has been its inspection ser
vice, and that these improved condi
tions are not more general is due to the
insufficient number of inspectors em
ployed. The Inspection . service has
fully demonstrated its usefulness, and
in appropriating for its maintenance
the Congress should make provision for
an Increase in the number of Inspectors.
The excessive hours of labor to which
railroad employes in train service are
in many cases subjected is also a mat
ter which may well engage the serious
attention of the Congress. The strain,
both mental and physical, upon thosÂ«
who are engaged in the movement and
operation of railroad trains under mod
ern conditions is perhaps greater than
that which' exists in any other industry,
and If there are any reasons for limit
ing by law the hours of labor in any
employment, they certainly apply with
peculiar force to the employment of
those upon whose vigilance and alert
ness in the performance of their duties
the eafety of all who travel by rail de
pends.
EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY
LAW GREATLY DESIRED
Should Be Applied to Industries
Within Scope of Federal
Power.
In my. annual message to the Fifty
seventh Congress, at Its second session,
X recommended the passage of an em
ployers' liability law for the District
of Columbia and in our navy yards. I
renewed that recommendation in my
message to the Fifty-eighth Congress,
at its second session, and further sug
gested the appointment of a commis
sion to make a comprehensive study of
employers* liability, with. a view to the
enactment of a wise and constitutional
law covering the subject, applicable to
all industries within the scope of the
Federal power. I hope that such a law
will be prepared and enacted as speedi
ly as possible.
JUST TREATMENT URGED
ON CAPITAL AND LABOR
Inquiry Should Be Made Into
Strikes Affecting Inter
state Commerce.
The National Government has as a
rule but little occasion to deal with the
formidable group of problems connect
ed more or lees directly with what Is
known as the labor question, for In the
great majority of cases these problems
must be dealt with by the State and
municipal authorities and not by the
National . Government. The National
Government has control of the District
of Columbia, however, and it should seÂ«>
to it that the city of Washington, is
made a model city in all respects, both
as regards parks, public playgrounds,
proper regulation of the system of
bousing so as to do away with the evils
of alley tenements, a proper system' of
education, a proper system of dealing
with truancy and Juvenile offenders, a
proper handling of the charitable work
of the District. Moreover, \ there should
â¢be proper factory. laws ', to. prevent? all
abuse* in the employment of * womÂ»m
and children in the District. These will
be 'useful- chiefly as object lessons, but
even this 'limited amount of usefulness
would be Of real national value.
There has been demand for depriving
courts of the power to issue injunctions
~ ' :' - ""\u25a0". '.x \u25a0BBBH
in labor disputes. Such special limita
tion of the equity powers of. our courts
would be most unwise. It is true that
! some Judges have misused this power;
! but this does not justify a denial ot the
power any more than an Improper exer
cise of the power to call a strike by a
labor leader would justify the denial
of the right to strike. The remedy is
to regulate the procedure by requiring
the Judge to give due notice - to the
> adverse parties before granting: the
writ, the hearing to be ex parte if the
adverse party does not appear at the
time and place ordered. What -is due
notice must depend upon the facts of
the case; it should not be used as a
pretext to permit violation of law, or
the jeopardizing of life or property. Of
course, this would not authorize the
i Issuing of a restraining order of injunc
tion In any case in which it Is not al
ready authorized by existing law.
I renew the recommendation I made
in my .last annual message for an ln
1 vestlgatlon by the Department of Com
merce and Labor of general labor con
ditions, especial attention to be paid to
the conditions of child labor and child
labor legislation in the several States.
Such an Investigation should take Into
account the various problems with
which the question of child labor is
connected. It is true that these prob
lems can be actually met in most cases
only by the States themselves, but it
would be well for the . nation to en
deavor to secure and publish compre
hensive information as to the conditions
of the labor of children in the different
States, so as to spur up those that are
behindhand and to secure approxi
mately uniform legislation of a high
character among- the several States.
In such a republic as ours the one
thing that we cannot afford to neglect
is the problem of ' turning out decent
citizens. The future of the nation de%
pends upon the citizenship of the gene
rations to come; the children of to-day
are those who to-morrow will shape
the destiny of our land, and we can
not afford to neglect them. The Legis
lature of Colorado has recommended
that the National Government provide
some general measure for the protec
tion from abuse of children and dumb
animals throughout the United States.
I lay the matter before you for what
I trust will be your favorable consid
eration.
WOMEN IN INDUSTRY.
Coincident With Decrease In Marriage
and the Birth Rate.
The Department of Commerce and La
bor should also make a thorough inves
tigation of the conditions of women 'in
industry. : Over five million American
women are now engaged in gainful oc
cupations; yet there is an almost com
plete dearth of data upon which to base
any trustworthy conclusions as regards
a subject as important as it Is vast and
complicated.* There is need â¢ of; full
knowledge on which to base .action
looking toward State and municipal
legislation for the. protection of work-
Ing women. ' \u25a0-\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0 "":.\u25a0;
The Introduction of women into in
dustry Is working change and disturb
ance in the domestic and social life of
the nation. The decrease in marriage,
and especially in the birth rate, -has
been coincident with it. We must face
accomplished facts, and the adjustment
to factory conditions must be made; but
surely it can be made with less friction
and less harmful effects on family life
than Is now the case. This whole mat
ter In reality forms one of the greatest
sociological phenomena of our time; It
is a social question of the first import
ance, of far greater Importance than
any merely political or economic ques
tion can be; and to solve it we need
ample data, gathered in a sane, and
scientific spirit in the course of an ex
haustive Investigation.
In any great labor disturbance not
only are employer and employe inter
ested, but also a third party â the gen
eral public Every considerable labor
difficulty, in which interstate commerce
is involved, should be investigated by
the Government and the facts officially
reported to the public.
The question of securing a. healthy,
self-respecting and mutually sympa
thetic attitude as between employer, and
employe, capitalist and wage- worker,
Is a difficult one. All phases of the la
bor problem prove difficult when ap
proached. But the underlying princi
ples, the root principles, In accordance
with which the problem must be solved,
are entirely simple. '.We can get jus
tice and right dealing only if we <\u25a0 put
as of paramount importance the princi
ple of treating a man on his worth as
a man rather than wtih reference to his
social position, his occupation or the
class to which he belongs. There are
eelfish and brutal men In all ranks of
life. If they are capitalists their selfish
ness and brutality may ' take the form
of hard indifference to suffering, greedy
disregard of every moral ; restraint
which Interferes with the accumulation
of 'wealth, and cold-blooded exploita
tion of the weak:. or, if they are labor
ers, the form of laziness, of sullen envy
of the more fortunate and of willing
ness to perform deeds of murderous
violence. Such conduct is just as repre
hensible in one case as in â¢ the." other.'
and all honest and farseeing men
should join In warring against it wher
ever it becomes manifest.
Individual capitalist and individual
wage-worker, corporation and \u25a0 union,
are alike entitled to the protection of
tho law, and must alike otftey the law.
Moreover, in addition to mere obedience
to the jaw, each man, if he be really
a good cltizep. # must show broad sym
pathy for his neighbor, and genuine de
sire to look at any question arising be
tween them from the standpoint of that
neighbor no less .than, from his own;
and to this : end , it . is essential that
capitalist and wage-worker should
consult > freely one -with - the .; other,
should each strive to bring closer the
day when both shall realize that they
are properly partners and not enemies.
To approach the questions which In
evitably arise between them solely from
the standpoint which ' treats each â¢ side
in the mass as the enemy, of the other
*!de In the mass is both wicked and
foolish. . . . â¢ \u25a0'<\u25a0<;: \u25a0
DANGERS OF CLASSES.
Munt, Avert - Rule by Plutocracy or by
. Mob.
In the past the most' direful among
the influences which . have- brought
about the downfall of republics \u0084 has
ever been the growth of the class spirit,
the growth of the spirit which tends; to
make a man subordinate ,tbe? welfare
of the public as a whole to the welfare
of the particular class to "Which he be
longs,' the substitution of loyalty -.tor a
class. for loyalty, to the nation. This
Inevitably brings , about a < tendency, to
treat each man not on his merits as an
individual;'.- but; on' his position as Â» be
lousing to a certain class In t the, com-'
munity. If such a spirit grows . up \u25a0- in
this â¢â¢ republic.. It will â¢, ultimately, prove
fatal - to us. as . in * the past i has proved
fatal to "every /community In- which it
has become dominant. \
. Unless; we continue "to .Mteep a quick
and' lively; senses of the great funda
mental ' truth - that ; our,' concern Is .with
the . individual V worth of the , individual
man,- this - Government cannot perma
nently- hold the- place' which It has

achieved among the nations. The vital
lines of. cleavage among our people do
not correspond, and indeed run" at right
angles to the lines of cleavage which (
divide occupation v from . occupation,'
which divide wage-workers from capi
talists, farmers 5 from bankers, x men of
small means from men ! of large means,'
men who live -in the . towns from men
who live in the country: for the vital
line of , Is ; the line which di
vides the honest man who tries to do
well by his neighbor from the dishonest
man who does ill by his neighbor. - -
In other words, the standard we
should establish is the standard of con
duct, .not .the standard of occupation,
of means. . or of social position. It Is
the man s moral quality, his attitude
toward the great questions which con
cern all humanity, his cleanliness of
life, his power to do ; his duty toward
himself and toward others, which real
ly count; and if wÂ« substitute for, the
standard of personal; Judgment, which
treats each man according to his mer
its, another ; standard in accordance
witn which all men of - one ' class are
favored and^ all men of another class
discriminated against, wÂ« shall do .ir
reparable damage to the body politic
I believe; that our r people are 'too
cane, too self-respecting, too fit for
self-government, ever to adopt such
an attitude. This Government is not
and never shall be government by ; a
plutocracy. This ~ Government is .'not
and never shall be government by a
mob. It shall continue to be in - the
future what it has been In the past, a
government based on the theory that
each man, rioh or poor. Is to be treated
simply and solely on his worth as a
man, that all his i personal and prop
erty rights are to be safeguarded, and
that he is neither to. wrong others nor
to suffer wrong from others.
The noblest of all forms of govern
ment is. self-government; but it is also
the most' difficult. : WÂ« who possess
this priceless boon, and who desire to
hand It on to our children and bur
children's children, should ever bear
In mind the thought so finely expressed
by Burke: "Men are qualified for civil
liberty In exact proportion to their dis
position to put moral chains upon their
own appetites; in proportion as 'they
are disposed .to listen to the counsels
of the wise end good In preference to
the flattery of knaves. Society cannot
exist unless a controlling: power upon
will and appetite be placed somewhere,
and the, less of it there be within the
more there must be without. It is or
dained In the: eternal constitution of
things that men of intemperate minds
cannot be free. " Their passions forge
their fetters." ...
NATIONAL SUPERVISION Wi
:yi OF'INSURANCE AFFAIRS
Gross Abuses Show Tjujt Regula
v \u25a0â¢tion by the ' States Is ; \
Inadequate.
The great , Insurance companies af
ford striking examples of corporations
whose business 'has. extended so far
beyond-.the Jurisdictions; of the States
which created thtem as;. to preclude
strict enforcement of,. supervision and
regulation by -the parent . States. In
my last message I: recommended "that
the Congress consider whether the
power of ,the \u25a0 Bureau jof Corporations
cannot constitutionally, be extended to
cover interstate transactions in insur
ance." Recent . events have emphasized'
the importance "of - an early \u25a0 and : ex
haustive consideration of this question,
to see whether it is not possible to fur
nish better safeguards than the'sever
al States have been able to furnish
against corruption of the flagrant kind
which has been exposed. ; .
It has been- only j too . clearly shown
that certain. of the men at the head of
these large corporations take but small
note of the* ethical distinction between
honesty and : dishonesty ; they draw ; the
line only : this side :of what may i be
called law-honesty, the kind of honesty
necessary in order to avoid falling into
the clutches of the law. Of course the
only complete remedy for this condition
must be found in:: an aroused public
conscience, a higher sense' of ethical
conduct in the community at large, and
especially among business menÂ»and*in
the great profession of the law, and in
the growth of a spirit which condemns
all dishonesty, whether in rich man or
In poor man, whether it takes the shape
of Tbribery or of blackmail. ;.v~
. But much can be done by legislation
which is not only - drastic, but practi
cal. .There Is need of a far stricter and
more -uniform regulation of the vast
insurance interests of this country.' The
United States should, in n this respect
follow the policy of . other nations by
providing adequate national . super
vision or . commercial \u25a0. interests which
are clearly- national In. character. \u25a0-
My . predecessors have /repeatedly
recognized that; the, foreign business of
these companies is an Important part
of; our' foreign commercial,- relations.
During the * administrations of - Presi
dents Cleveland, Harrison- and.McKin
ley, the State Department exercised its
Influence, through diplomatic channels.
to prevent ". unjust <. discrimination 'by

MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM

Briefly Touched Upon by
There is more need of stability than
of the attempt to attain an ideal per
fection in the methods $of raising
revenue; and the shock and strain to
the business ; world 5 certain to > attend
any serious, change In â¢ these methods
render such change Inadvisable unless
for grave reason. - It is not possible to
lay down any general - rule â¢by which
to determine the moment when the rea
sons for will outweigh the reasons
against such a change. .Much must'de
pend, not merely on the needs, but on
the desires, of the people as a whole;
for needs and \u25a0 desires are not neces
sarily identical. --.\u25a0.".\u25a0-. - â¢: 'â¢;\u25a0 - '
Of course, no change can be made on
lines beneficial ! to, or desired by, one
section or one State-only.--. There must
be something like a general agreement
among the citizens of the several
States, as represented in the Congress,
that the change is needed \u25a0 and desired
in the interest of the people as a' whole;
land there should then.be a sincere, mi
i telligent and disinterested - effort to
make it in such Bhape as will combine,
so , far as possible, the maximum of
good to \u25a0 the people at' large with the
minimum of necessary, disregard ! for

But in time, of peace the revenue
must; on the average, taking, a -series
of years together, equal .the expendi
tures or else the; revenues must he in
creased. Last year there, was a 'deficit.
Unless our expenditures can be -. kept
within the revenues then our -revenue
laws must be readjusted. -It. : la as yet
too early to attempt to outline what
shape such a readjustment should take,'
for It Is as yet too early to say, whether
there will be need for it.
: : It. should be considered : whether Jt
Is - not desirable that the . tariff, laws
should provide for applying as against
or in j favor of any other nation maxi
mum and minimum ; tariff rates estab
lished by the Congress, so as to secure
a 1 certain reciprocity of treatment be-
Jtween other- nations and ourselves.
Having In. view even larger considera
tions of policy than those of a purely
economic nature, it would, in my Judg
ment, \u25a0-\u0084 be well to endeavor^ 4 to :. bring!
about closer commercial -connections

RIGID ECONOMY, URGED.
Unnecessary Offices Under Government
Should be Abolished.
: I earnestly recommend -to : the* Con
gress the need of economy and to this
end of a rigid scrutiny, of appropria
tions. As examples merely, I call your
attention to one or; two specific maT
ters. All unnecessary offices j should be
abolished. The* Commissioner of the
General \u25a0 Land . Office recommends the'
.the abolishment of. the', office, of re
ceiver of public moneys ,\u25a0 for 'United
States land offices. . This will effect a
saving of about a quarter of a million
dollars a year. As the business of the
1 nation grows it I* 'inevitable .that there
should r>e from time to time a ! legiti
mate' increase <in thernumber of' offi-"
cials, and this fact renders it all the
I more : important that when * offices be
come unnecessary they should be abol
ished. '\u25a0\u25a0 : --\ ' '..-.;\u25a0-:\u25a0\u25a0-.':-\u25a0\u25a0.;-â¢\u25a0:,\u25a0;\u25a0

There is a constantly ; growing: ten

FULL PUBLICITY URGED '
AS TO CAMPAIGN FUNDS
Contributions by Corporations
.''\u25a0;â¢ {Should Be Expressly For- ,
bidden by Law.
In my. last annual message I said:
"The power of the Government -to
protect the integrity of the elections of
its own I officials |is inherent and has
been recognized and affirmed by repeat
ed declarations of the Supreme Court.
There is no enemy, of free government
more dangerous and - none so insidious
as the corruption of the electorate. No
one defends or excuses corruption, and
it would- seem to follow that none would
oppose vigorous measures to eradicate
it-^ "I recommend-, the enactment of
a law directed against bribery : and
corruption in Federal elections. The
1 details of such a law. may be
safely left to the. wise discretion of the
Congress, but *It should go as far as
under the constitution it is possible -to
go, and should include severe penalties
against, him; who 'gives or . receives a
bribe Intended to influence his act or
opinion as an elector; and .provisions
for the publication not only of the ex
penditures for nominations and eleo-
I tlons of all candidates, but also of all
I contributions received and expenditures
made by, political* committees.".
.*â¢\u25a0-â¢ I desire: to repeat this recommenda
tion, lit political campaigns in a coun
try as large and populous aa ours It !Â»
inevitable that there should be much
expense of an entirely legitimate . kind.
This, of course, means that many con
tributions, I and . some lof them of large
size, must be '\u25a0\u25a0 made, and,, as a matter
of fact, in any big political contest such
contributions are always made to both
sides. It is entirely proper both to give
and receive them, unless there Is an lm
i proper* motive - connected : with
gift or reception; If they are extorted
by any kind of pressure or promise, ex
press -or implied, direct* or- indirect, In
the way of favor or immunity, then the
giving or r receiving becomes - not only
improper but: criminal.
: It \u25a0 will undoubtedly be difficult as a
matter of practical detail to shape an
act which shall guard with reasonable
certainty against such misconduct; but
if it is possible to secure by - law \u25a0 the
full and. verified publication in detail of
all the sums contributed to and expend
ed by -the candidates -or committees of
any political parties- the, result cannot
but be wholesome.. Air contributions
by. corporations to any political com-,
mlttee or 1 for any political purpose
should be forbidden by law; directors
should not be. permitted to use stock
holders* '.money .for - such purposes;
and, moreover, a prohibition of this
kind i would ' be, \u25a0 as * far- as ,i t went, ati
effective method : of stopping the evils
aimed . at :ln : corrupt- practices acts.
â¢:Not only should both the national and
the several t State 'Legislatures forbid
any officer of a corporation from using
the money vof the : corporation in ot
about . any election, but they: should
also forbid such use of money in con
nection .with any,' legislation save by
the employment of counsel in public
manner for distinctly, legal services.
TENDENCIES OF NATION
STRONGLY FOR PEACE
Lasting Benefits Expected From
the Second Conference at
,~The Hague.
The first Conference . of Nations held
at The Hague An 1899, being unable to
dispose i of ; all the business before ".; it,
recommended the consideration and set
tlement of a number of; Important ques
tions bjÂ» another, conference to be called
subsequently, and at an early date.
These v questions were -the^following:
(1) The rights and: duties of neutrals;
<2) ! the limitation 'Of the armed
on land and \u25a0 sea, " and -of military . bud
gets; (3), the use of new. types and cali
bers of military -and naval g-uns;. (4)
the s inviolability of private- property. at
sea In times. of war; (5) the bombard
ment, of ports, cities and villages .-by
naval forces. ;
\ In October,- 1904,, at: the Instance of
the Interparliamentary ' Union, which,
at a conference held : in the : United
States and attended by the lawmakers
of. fifteen different nations, had reite
rated : the > demand for. a second Conf err

all the powers signatory to The Hague
Convention * to , send â¢ delegates to â¢" such
a conference and; suggested that It be
again held at The Hague. In: its note
of December 16.11904; the United States

belief that :the conference could be best

lin I civilized I countries for, individuals to
protects theirrights .with a strong hand,
it ' is f therefore â¢ unnecessary, for \u25a0 nations
. to . be ready to defend their rights.
.These persons would do Irreparable
harm to any nation -that adopted their
principles, and even as it is they se
riously hamper the cause which they
advocate by tending to render It absurd
in the oyes of sensible and patriotic
men. - There* ; can be no - worse foe of
mankind In general, and -of his own
country In - particular, . than the â¢ dema
gogue of war. the man . who In mere
folly or to serve his own selfish ends
continually rails at and abuses other
nations, who seeks to excite his coun
trymen against foreigners . on Insuffi
cient pretexts, who incites and inflames
perverse and aggressive '\u25a0 national -van
ity, and who may on occasions wanton
ly bring on conflict between his nation
and some other nation. But there are
demagogues of peace just as. there are
demagogues of war, and 'in any such
movement as this for The Hague con
ference it is essential not to be misled
by one set of extremists any more than
by the other.
Whenever It is possible for a nation or
an individual to work for real peace,
assuredly it is failure of duty not so to
strive; but if warls. necessary ana
righteous then either the man or the
nation . shrinking, from It forfeits all
title to self-respect. We have scant
sympathy ; with the sentimentalist who
dreads oppression less .than physical
suffering, who would prefer a shame
ful peace to the pain and toll some
times lamentably necessary in order to
secure a righteous peace.
! As yet there is only a partial and im
perfect analogy between international
law and Internal or municipal law, be
cause there is.no sanction of force for
executing, the former while there is in
the case of the latter. The private citi
zen .is protected in his rights by. tho
law, because the law rests in the last
resort upon force exercised through the
forms of law. A man does not have to
defend his rights with his own, hand,
because he can call upon' the police,
upon the Sheriff's posse, upon the
militia, or in-, certain .extreme cases
upon the army, to defend him. But
there is no. such sanction of force for
International law.
At present there could.be no greater
calamity than for- the Â« free people, the
enlightened, ; independent and peace
loving peoples, to disarm while yet
leaving it open to any barbarism or
despotism to remain armed. So long as
the world is as unorganized as now.
the armies and "navies of those peoples
who on the 'whole stand for Justice,
offer not only the best,' but the only
possible" security- for a Just peace. For
instance, if the United States alone, or
In company only with the other nations
that en/ the whole tend to act Justly,
disarmed, we might sometimes avoid
bloodshed, but we would cease to be
of weight in securing the peace of Jus
tice â tho real peace for, which . the most
law-abiding and high-minded men must
iat times be willing to fight.. As. the
' world Is now, only that nation Is equip
ped for ipeace that knows how to, flght
and thai will not shrink from fighting
if ever the conditions become such, that
war is demanded in the name of the
highest morality. \
ASSEMBLY OF NATIONS.
Golden Rule Will in Time Define
Course of Powers.
So much it Is emphatically necessary
to Bay in order both that the position
of the -United States may not be mis
understood, and that a genuine effort to
bring nearer j the day of the peace of
justice among the nations 'may not be
hampered by a folly which. In striving
to achieve the Impossible, would render
It hopeless to attempt .the achievement
of the practical. But while recognis
ing most clearly all above set forth, it
remains our clear duty to strive in
every practicable, way to bring nearer
the time when the sword shall not be

I At present the practical ..^thinff- to do

nassbeeni and ;Is "being gradually Â»\u25a0 de
veloped "vby^. this ' nation \u25a0 and accepted
by other -nation s.* No other^ policy could
have been as ettlclent In promoting peace
In the Western' Hemisphere and â¢ in - glv;
i ing to each nation thereon the chance
to develop along its own lines. If wÂ«
had refused to apply -the doctrine to
changing: conditions, it vmldnow bÂ«
completely outworn, would not meÂ«l
any of the needs of the present day.
and, Indeed, would probably by this
time have sunk into complete oblivion.
It is useful at home and is meeting
with, recognition abroad, because wa
have adapted our application of It. to
meet the growing and changing needs
of the hemisphere.
When we announce a policy, such as*
, the Monroe Doctrine." we- thereby com
mit ourselves to the consequences of
the policy, and those consequences
from time to time alter. It is out ot
the question to claim a right and yet
shirk the responsibility for its exorcise.
Not only we, but all American republics
who are benefited by the existence -of
tha doctrine, must recognize- the ob
ligations each nation Is under as re
gards foreign peoples no less than its
duty to. insist upon its own rights.
That our rights and interests arÂ«
deeply concerned in the maintenance
of the doctrine is so clear as hardly to
need argument. This is especially true
in view of the construction of the
Panama Canal. As a mere matter oC ,
self defense, we must exercise a clona
watch over the approaches to this
canal; and this means that we must b>
thoroughly alive to our interests in,
the Caribbean Sea. *
â¢ There are - certain essential points*
which must never be forgotten as re- '
gards the' Monroe Doctrine. In th*
first place we must as a nation make â¢
It evident that we do \u25a0 not intend to
, treat It to any shape or way as an ex
cuse for aggrandizement on our part
at the expense of the republics of the
south. We must recognize the fact
: that In' some South American. countries
there has been much suspicion last wo
should Interpret Che Monroe Doctrlno
as In. some way Inimical to their In
terests. â¢ and we must try to eonvinÂ«e
all the other nations of this continent
once and for all that no just and or
derly Government has anything to fear
from !us^ < s , : J~-
There are certain republics to. tha
south of us which have already reached
such a point of stability, order and
prosperity . that they themselves,
though as yet hardly consciously, arÂ«
among the guarantors of this doctrine.
These republics we now meet not only
on a basis, of entire equality, but^in a
spirit . of frank and respectful friend
ship, which we hope Is mutual. If all
of the republics to the south of us will
only grow as those to which I allude
have already grown, all need for U3 to>
be the especial champions of the doc
trinewill disappear, for no stable ana
growing American republic wishes to>
see some great non- American ' military
power acquire territory In Its neigh-.
! borhood. All that this country de
sires is that the other republics on,
this continent shall be happy and pros
perous; and they cannot be happy and
prosperous unless they maintain order
within their boundaries and behava
with a just regard for their obligations
toward outsiders.
It must be understood that under no
circumstances will the United State*
use the Monroe Doctrine as a cloak for
territorial aggression. We desire peace
with all the world, but perhaps most of
all with, the othcrpeoples of the Amerl- 1
can Continent. There are. of course,
limits to the wrongs which any self
respecting nation can endure. It is al
ways possible that wrong actions to
ward this nation, or toward citizens of
this nation, in some state unable to
keep order among Its own people, un
able to secure Justice from outsiders,
and 'unwilling: to do . justice to those
outsiders who treat it well, may result
In our having to take action to protect
our rights; out such action will not
be taken with a view to territorial ag
gression, and it will be taken at all
only with extreme reluctance and when
it has become evident that every other
resource has been exhausted.

The case is more difficult -when it
refers to a contractual obligation. Our

to enforce such contractual obligations
on" behalf of Its citizens by an appeal
to arms. It fs much to be wished that
all foreign Governments would take
the same view. But they do not; and
In consequence we are -liable at any
time to be brought face to face witfcv
disagreeable alternatives. On thÂ« onw

debt; on the other hand. It is very in
advisable to permit any. foreign' power
to take - possession, even temporarily,
of the custom-houses of ah American
republic in ordÂ»r to enforce the pay

porary occupation might turn into as
permanent occupation.
The only escape from these alterna

must ourselves' undertake to bring
about some arrangement by which so
much as possible of a just obligation
shall Ibe paid.- It is far better that
this country should put through such
an arrangement, rather than allow any
foreign country to undertake it. To do
so insures the defaulting republic from
having to pay : debts of an improper
character under duress, while it also
insures honest creditors of the republic
from bÂ«ing passed by in the interest
of dishonest or grasping creditors.
Moreover, for. the United States to take
such a position offers the only possible
way of insuring us against . a clash,
with some foreign power. The position
Is,'- therefore, in the interest . of ' peace â¢
as well as In the interest of justice. It

SAKTO DOMINGO PLACED
UPON A STABLE BASIS
Island Republic Thrives White:
Customs Are in Control of
This brings me to what should be
one of the fundamental objects of the
Monroe Doctrine. Wemust ou "f ve *.
In, good faith try to help upward- to
ward peace and order those of our sis
ter republic which need such help. Just
as there has been a gradual growth of
the ethical element in the relations oC
one individual to another, so we are.
r even though slowly, more and mor*
coming to recognize the duty^ of bear-,
ing one another's burdens, not only as
among individuals, but also as amongr
na Ranto. Domingo, in her turn, has now
made an appeal to us to help her. and
not only every principle Â»of . wisiSom,
but every generous instinct within ua
bids us respond to rthe appeal. It- U
not- of the .slightest consequem-e
whether we. grant the Â»aid- needed, by
Santo Domingo as an incident to the
wise development, of the Monroe Doc
trine, or because we regard the case
of Santo ' Domingo as standing wholly ?
by Itself, and to be treated as such, and
noton general principles or .with any
reference to the Monroe Doctrine. '." The
Important- point is to give the needed,
aid.' and the, case fa certainly sufficient
ly peculiar to deserve to be judged
purely on, its. own merits.
The conditions * in Santo Domingo
have for, a number \of years grown
from bad to worse, until a year ago all
society was, on the verge of â¢dissolu
tion; \, Fortunately,- Just at this , time, a
ruler sprang up in Santo Domingo, who.
with his colleagues, saw the dangers
threatening*- their country and appealed
to "the. friendship iof \he - only .great

Ihk to her Internal disorders she had I
ceased *<> be able to provide means of i
paying the debts.. The patience of her \
101 e!gn creditors had liccome exhausted,
and at least two fonign nations were
on the point of intervention, and were
only prevented from Intervening by the
unofficial assurance of this Government
that 1t would itself strive to help Santo
Doruir.go in her hour of need. In the
cas>e of 0:10 of these nations, only the
actual opening of negotiations to this
er.d by our Government prevented the
seizure of territory in Santo Domingo
by a European power. Of the debt* in
curred some were just, while some were
sot of a character which really renders
It obligatory oil, or proper for. Santo
Domingo io pay them in full. But she
could not pay any of them unless some
Stability was assured her Government
a;.o people.
Accordingly the Executive Depart
ment of our Government negotiated a
treaty under which we are to try to
, help the Dominican people to straighten
Â«et their finances. This treaty is pend
ing before the Senate. In the meantime
a. temporary arrangement has been
made which will last until the Senate
fcas had time to tuke action upon the
treaty. Under this arrangement the
Dominican Government has appointed
A,' .ericans to all the important posi-.
ns in the customs service, and they
rf/e seeing to the honest collection of
the revenues, turning over 45 per cent
to the Government for running expenses
*r.d putting the other 55 per cent into
C safe depositary lor equitable division
In case the treaty shall be ratified,
among the various creditors, whether
European or American.
The Custom-houses offer well-nigh
Sic only sources of revenue in Santo
omingo, and the different revolutions
vsuallv have as their real aim the ob
taining possession of these Custom
houses. The mere fact that the collect
ors of customs are Americans, that they
are performing their duties with effi
ciency and honesty, and that the treaty
Is pending in the Senate, gives a certain
moral power to the Government or
Canto Domingo which it has not had
before. This has completely discour
aged all revolutionary movement, while
it has ;ilr*ady produced such an in
crease in the revenues that the Govern
ment is actually getting more from the
Is per cent that the American collectors
turn over to it than it got formerly
' tihen It took the entire revenue. It is
enabling the poor harassed people of
flanto Dorr.ingo once more to turn tneir
attention to industry and to be free
from the curEe of Interminable revolu
tionaxy disturbance.
BENEFITS OF TREATY.
I- â¢ Adoption by Senate earnestly
Recommended.
It offers to all bona fide creditors,
A merican and European, the only really
good chance to obtain that to \u25a0which
toey are justly entitled, while it In re
**-:rn gives to Santo Domingo the only
Jr. I'ortunlty of defense against claims
trfcieh it ought not to pay, for now if
It meets the views of the Senate we
eliall ourselves thoroughly examine all
tnese claims, whether American or for
eign, and see that none that are im-
I roper are paid. There is. of course.
epposltion to the treaty from dishonest
creditors, foreign and American, and
from the professional revolutionists of
the island itself. We have already rea
800 to believe that some of the credi
tors who do not dare expose their
ciainifc to honest scrutiny are endeavor
ing to stir up sedition in the island
cr.d opposition to the treaty. In thÂ«Â»
r.r-antime I have exercised the author
ity vested in me by the joint resolution
oi t!:e Congress to prevent the intro
cuctioTi of arms Into the island for rev-
C'l-Jtionary purposes.
Under the course taken, stability and
order and all the benefits of peace are
nt last coming to Santo Domingo, dan
ger of foreign intervention has been
t.^snenrl'^, Â«nd tbÂ»Â«-Â« is -if last a pros-
I'.ecf thst all creditors will get' Justice,
r.o more. and no less. If the arrange
r.K-nt is terminated by the failure of the
treaty chaos will follow; and if chaos
Tollows. sooner or later this Govern
ment may be Involved in serious diffi
culties with' foreign Governments ovei
the 'island, or else may be forced Itself
to intervene in the island In some un
pleasant fashion.
Under the proposed treaty the inde
pendence of the Island is scrupulously
respected, the danger of violation of the
Monroe Doctrine by the intervention of
foreign powers vanishes, and the inter
ference of our Government is mini
mized, so that we shall only act In con
junction with the Santo Domingo au
thorities to secure the proper adminis
tration of the customs, and therefore to
. Bocure the payment of just debts and to
B'-cure the Dominican Government
arainst demands for unjust debts. Tne
j^roposed method will give the people
*"*Â»' Santo Domingo the same chance to
i^vve onward and upward which w*
hÂ«-.ve already given to the people of
Cuba. It will be doubly to our discredit
as a nation if we fall to take edvantagre
of this chance; for It will be of damage
to ourselves, and it will be of incal
culable damage to Santo Domingo. Ev
Â«ry consideration of wise policy, and,
above all, e\'ery consideration of large
K^neroFity, bids us meet the request of
giinto Domingo as we are now trying
to meet It.
CHANGES RECOMMENDED.
IN THE ARMY AND NAVY
iftlaneuvers on a Larger Scale De
sired in Former Branch
of Service.
We cannot consider the question of our
Icreirn policy without at the same time
treating of the army and navy. We now
save a very small armyâ lndeed, one
Irell-nlrh Infinitesimal when compared
with the army of any other large na
1 tlcn. Of course the army we do have
1 fthould be as nearly perfect of Its kind
and for Its size as Is possible. I do not
believe the! any army. In the world has
a better average of enlisted man or .a
. Setter type of junior officers; but the
army should be trained to act effectively
in a mass. Provision should be made by
vufficient appropriations for maneuvers
Jt ! a practical kind co that the troops
learn how to take care of themselves
under actual service conditions; every
inarch, for Instance, being made with the
soldier loaded exactly as he would be In
an active campaign. The generalsand col
onels would thereby have opportunity of
handling regiments, brigades and dlvls
; lons, and the commissary and medical de
. partments would be tested in the field.
Provision should be made for the exer
c'se at least of a brigade and by prefer
ence of a division In marching and em
barking at some point on our coast and
; disembarking at some other point and
continuing its march. The number of
pests in which the army is kept in time
-of peace ehould be materially diminished
and the rosts that are left made'corre
spondingly larger. No local interests
ehould be allowed to stand in the way
of assen^Ung the greater part of the
troops which would at need form our
field armies in stations of such size as
v/ill permit the best training to be given
to the personnel of all grades, including
the high officers and staff officers. To ac
complish this end we must have not com
pany or regimental garrisons, but brigade
and division garrisons.
Promotion by mere seniority can never
result in a thoroughly efficient corps of
officers In. the higher ranks unless there
accompanies it a. vigorous" weeding-out
processâ that Is, such a process of selec
tionâls a chief feature of the four years'
course of the young officer at West Point.
There is no good reason why ft should
stop immediately upon his graduation.
â¢While at West Point he is dropped un
less he comes up to a certain standard of
excellence, and when he graduates he
UAzos rank in the army according to his
rank of graduation. The results are good
at West Point; and there should be in
th*Â» army itself something , that will
c ihicve the same end. After a certain age
fc-m 11 been reached, the average officer is
Vuif^ to do good work, below a. certain
grade. Provision should be made for the
promotion of exceptionally meritorious
men o\ r er the heads of their comrades and
for the retirement of all men who have
reached a given age without getting be
yond a given rank; this age of retirement
of course changing: from rank to rank.
FEDERAL CONTROL
FOR INSURANCE
I repeat my previous recommendation that the Congress
should also consider whether, the Federal Government lias
any power or owes any duty with respect to domestic trans
actions in insurance of an interstate character. That State
supervision has proved inadequate is * generally conceded:
The burden upon insurance companies, and therefore their
policy-holders, of conflicting regulations of many States, is
unquestioned, while but little effective check is imposed upon
any able and unscrupulous vian who desires to exploit the
company in his own interest at the expense of the policy
holders and of the public. The inability of a State to regu
late effectively insurance corporations created under the laws
of other States and transacting the larger part of their busi
ness elsewhere is also clear. As a remedy for this evil of con
flicting, ineffective and yet burdensome regulations there
has been for many years a widespread demand for Federal
supervision. The Congress has already recognized that inter
state insurance may be a proper subject for Federal' legisla
tion, for in creating the Bureau of Corporations if authorized
it to publish and supply useful information concerning in
terstate corporations, "including corporations engaged in in
surance."
In both the army and the navy there
ehould be some principle of-selection, that
Is of promotion for merit, and there
should be a resolute effort to eliminate
the agred officers of reputable character
who possess no special efficiency.
MEDICAL DEPARTMENT.
Its Efficiency Should be Improved by
Act of Conrreaa.
There should be an increase in the coast
artillery force; so that our coast fortifi
cations can be in some degree adequately
manned. There is special need for an
Increase and reorganization of the medi
cal department of the army. In both
the army and navy there must be the
came thorough training for duty in the
staff corps as In the fighting line. Only
by such training in advance can we be
sure that in actual war field operations
and those at sea will be carried on suc
cessfully. The importance of this was
shown conclusively in the Spanish-Ameri
can and the Russo-Japanese wars. The
work of the medical departments in the
Japanese army and navy is especially
worthy of study. I renew my recommen
dation of January 9, 1905, as to the medi
cal department of the army and call at
tention to the equal importance of the
needs of the staff corps of the navy.
In the medical department of the navy
the first in importance is the reorganiza
tion of the Hospital Corps, on the lines of
the Gallinger bill (S. 3334. February 1,
1304). and the reapportionment of the dif
terent grades of the medical officers to
meet, service requirements. It seems ad
visable also that medical officers of. the
army and navy should have similar rank
and pay in their respective grades, so' that
their duties can be carried on without
friction when they "are brought together.
The base hospitals of the navy should be
put In condition to meet modern require
ments and hospital ships be provided. Un
less we now provide with ample fore
thought for the medical needs of the
army and navy appalling suffering of a
preventable kind is sure to occur if ever
the country goes to war. It is not rea
sonable to expect succeesful administra
tion in time of war of a department
which lacks. a third of the number of offi
cers necessary to perform the medical
Bervice in time of peace. We need men
who are not merely doctors; thy must be
trained in the administration of military
medical service.
REPLACE OLD VESSELS.
Useless Tjpes Should be Dropped for
the Serviceable. '
Our navy must, relatively to the navies
of other nations, always be of greater size
than our army. We have most wisely
continued for a number of years to build
up our navy, and it has now reached
a fairly high Etandard of efficiency. This
standard of efficiency must not only be
maintained, but increased. It does not
seem 1 to me necessary, however, that the
navy shouldâ at least in the immediate
futureâ be Increased beyond the present
number of units. What is now clearly
necessary is to substitute efficient for in
efficient units' as the latter become worn
out or as it becomes apparent that they
are useless. Probably the result would
be attained by adding a single battleship
to our navy each year, the superseded or
outworn vessels being laid up or broken
up as they are thus replaced. -
The four single-turret monitors built
immediately after the close of the Span
ish war, for instance, are vessels which
would be of little use In the event of war
The money spent upon them could have
been more usefully spent In other ways.
Thus it would have been" far better never
to have built a single one of these moni
tors and to have put the money into an
ample supply of reserve guns. Most of
the smaller cruisers and gunboats, though
they serve a useful purpose so far as they
are needed for international police work,
would not add to the strength of our
navy is a conflict with a serious foe.
There Is urgent need of providing a large
Increase In the number of officers, and es
pecially in the number of enlisted men.
Recent naval history has emphasized
certain lessons which ought not to,
but which do, need emphasis. Seagoing
torpedo boats or destroyers are indis
pensable, not only for making night
attacks by surprise upon an enemy, out
even in battle for finishing already
crippled ships. Under exceptional cir
cumstances submarine boats would
doubtless be of use. Fast scouts are
needed. The main strength of the
navy, however, lies and can only lie in
the great battleships, the heavily ar
mored, heavily gunned vessels which
decide the mastery of the seas. Heavy
armed cruisers also play a most use
ful part, and unarmed cruisers, if swift
enough, are very useful as scouts. Be
tween antagonists of approximately
equal prowess the comparative perfec
tion of the instruments of war will or
dinarily determine the fight. .
But it is, of course, true that the
man behind the gun, the man in the en
gine-room, and the man in the con
ning tower, considered not only indi
vidually, but especially with regard to
the way In which they work together,
are even more important than the
weapons with -which they work. ' The
most formidable battleship is. of course
helpless against' even a light cruiser If
the men aboard it are unable to hit
anything with their guna; and thor
oughly well-handled cruisers may count
seriously in an engagement with- much
superior, vessels, if the men aboard
the latter are ineffective, whether from
lack of training or from any 'other
cause. .
Modern' warships are most formid
able mechanisms when .well handled
but they. are utterly useless when not
well handled; and they cannot be han
dled at all without: long and careful
training. This training can under no
circumstance , be given when once war
has broken out No fighting ship of
th* first class should ever be laid up
save for necessary repairs: and/ her
crew should be kept constantly: ex
ercised on the high seas, so that: she
may stand at the highest point of per
fection. . . . \u25a0 * .
To put a new and untrained crew
upon the most powerful battleship and
send* it out. to meet a formidable enemy
is not only to. invite but to insure dis
aster and disgrace. To improvise crews
at the outbreak of a war, so: far, as the
serious fighting craft are concerned,: is
absolutely hopeless. If the officers and
tnen are not thoroughly skilled in, and.
the 1 san francisco; call, avednesday^ December: g, 1905;
have not been, thoroughly trained to,
their duties, it would be far better to
keep the ships in port, during hostil
ities than to send them against a for
midable opponent, for the result could
only be that they would be either sunk
or captured. . .
The marksmanship of our navy is now
on the whole in a gratifying condition,
and there has been a great improvement
in fleet practice. We need additional
seamen; we need a large store of re
serve guns; we need sufficient money
for ample target practice, ample prac
tice of every- kind at sea. We should
substitute for comparatively inefficient
types â -the old third-class battleship
Texas, the single-turreted monitors
above mentioned, and indeed *all the
monitors and some of the old Cruisers
â efficient, modern, seagoing vessels.
Seagoing torpedo-boat destroyers
should be substituted for some of the
smaller torpedo t boats. ...
During the present Congress there
need be no additions to the aggregate
number of units of the navy. Our
navy, though very small relatively, to.
the navies of other nations, is for the
present sufficient in point of numbers
for our needs, and while we must con
stantly strive to make Its efficiency
higher, there need "v? no additions to
the total number of ships now built
and building, save in the* way of sub
stitution as above outlined. I recom
mend the report of the Secretary of
the Navy to the careful consideration
of the. Congress, especially with a view
to the legislation therein advocated.
NATURALIZATION LAWS '
TO PUT END TO FRAUDS
Changes in Statutes Suggested as
Result of Inquiry by
Commission.
i During the past year evidence has
accumulated to confirm the expressions
contained in my last two annual mes
sages as to the Importance of revising,
by appropriate legislation, our system
of naturalizin&allens. I appointed last
March a commission to. make a careful
examination of our naturalization laws,
and to suggest appropriate measures to
avoid the notorious abuses resulting
from the improvident or unlawful
granting of citizenship. This commis
sion, composed of an officer of the De
partment of State, of the Department
of Justice, and, of the Department -of
Commerce and Labor, has discharged
the duty Imposed upon it, and has sub
mitted a report, which will- be trans
mitted to the Congress for its consid
eration, and, I hope, for its favorable
action.
The distinguishing recommendations
of the commission are:
First. A Federal bureau of naturali
zation to be established in the Depart
ment of Commerce and Labor, to super
vise the administration of the ; naturali
zation laws and to receive returns of
naturalizations pending and. accom
plished.
Second. Uniformity of naturalization
certificates, fees to be charged, and pro
cedure. *â¢;;â¢
Third. More exacting .qualifications
for citizenship.
Fourth. The preliminary declaration)
of intention to be -abolished .and no
alien to be naturalized until at least
ninety days after the filing of his peti
tion. , -
â¢ : Fifth. ; Jurisdiction to naturalize
aliens to be confined to United States
district courts and to such State courts
as have jurisdiction in civil actions In
which the amount In controversy 1b un
limited; In cities of over 100,060 inhabi
tants the United, States district courts
to have exclusive Jurisdiction in the
naturalization of the alien residents of
such cities.
REVISION OF CRIMINAL
LAW OF THE COUNTRY
Many Rules 'Exist Which Have
Ceased to Serve Their
- Purpose.
In my last message I asked the atten
tion of the Congress to the urgent need
of action to make our. criminal law

quest that . you ; pay . heed to t the report
of the Attorney General on ithis ; sub

needfulito throw every safeguard round

he should be wronged by the State., The
danger : is . now ; exactly the .\u25a0 \u25a0-.-, reverse.
Our laws and customs tell immensely in
favor of the criminal: and against r the
interests of the public he . has .wronged.
Some antiquated and ; outworn ; rules
which once safeguarded ; the | threatened
rights'-' of private citizens, now merely
work harm to the general body, politic.
The criminal law,- of - the ; United States

PUBLIC LANDS DESIRED
FOR ACTUAL SETTLERS
Irrigation and Forestry Methods
Prove of Great Value to
People.
Once agartn I call your attention to
the condition of the public-land 'laws.
Recent developments have given new
urgency to the need for such changes
as will fit these laws to actual present
conditions. The honest disposal and
right use of the remaining public lands Â»
is of fundamental importance. The in- I
iqultous methods by which the monopo
lizing of the public lands is being
brought about under the present laws
are becoming more generally known.
Hut the existing laws do .not; furnish
effective remedies. The 3 recommenda
tions of the Public Lands Commission
upon this subject are wise and should
be given effect. \u25a0" ; \ ' \
The creation of small irrigated farms
under: tho Reclamation Act is a pow
erful offset to the tendency of certain
other laws to foster or permit monop
oly of the land. Under that act the
construction of great irrigation works
has been proceeding rapidly and" suc
cessfully, â¢ the lands reclaimed are
eagerly taken up, and the prospect that
the policy of national irrigation will
accomplish all that was expected of It
is bright. . The act should be .extended
to include the State of Texas. -
The Reclamation Act derives much
of its value from the fact that It tends
to secure the greatest possible num
ber, of homes on the land, and to create
communities of freeholders, in part by
settlement on public land, . in part by
forcing the subdivision of large private
holdings before they can get water
from Government Irrigation works*'
The law requires that no right to the
use of water. for land in private owner
ship shall be sold for a tract exceed
ing 160 acres to any one land owner.
This provision has excited active and
powerful hostility, buf the success of
the law itself depends on the wise and
firm enforcement of it. We cannot af
ford to substitute tenants for free
holders on the public domain.
The greater part of the remaining
public lands cannot be Irrigated. They
are at present and will probably-al
ways be' of greater value for grazing
than for any -other* purpose. This fact
has led to the grazing 7 homestead â¢; of
640 acres in Nebraska and to the pro
posed extension of it to other States.
It is argued that a family cannot be
supported on 160 acres of : arid graz
ing" land. :: This is obviously true; 'but
neither cana family be supported on
640 acres of much of the land to which
It is proposed to. apply the -grazing
homestead. To establish universally
any such arbitrary limit would be un
wise at the: present time. -','
It would probably result on the one
hand in enlarging the holdings of some
of the great land owners, and on the
other in needless suffering -and failure
on the part of a very considerable pro
portion of the bona fide settlers,: who
give faith to the implied assurance of
the Government that such" an area Is
sufficient. The best use of the public
grazing lands requires | the careful ex
amination and classification of these
lands in order to give each settler
land enough" to support his family and
no more. , " \u25a0'â¢.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
'While, this work is being done, and
until the lands are settled, the Gov
ernment should take control of i the
open range, under,; reasonable regula
tions suited to local needs, following
the general policy already in success
ful operation on the forest reseryes. It
is probable that the - present grazing
value of the open public range . ; is
scarcely more than half ; what it, once
was or what it 'might easily be again
under careful regulation. - '
The forest policy of the administra
tion appears, to enjoy the unbroken'
support of the people. * The great users
of timber are themselves forwarding
the movement for forest preservation.
All organized opposition to the fore9t
reserves in the West : has disappeared.
Since" the consolidation -of all Govern
ment forest work in the National For
est Service there has been a rapid and
notable gain in the ; usefulness of the
forest reserves to the people and in
public appreciation of their value. The
national parks within or adjacent , to
forest reserves should be transferred
to the charge of the Forest Service also.

SUPERVISION OVER CORPORATIONS.
The fortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, and vest such power
in those that wield them,, as to; make it a matter of necessity to give to the sovereignâ that is,
to the Government, which represents the people as a whole, some effective power of super
; vision over their corporate use. In order to insure a healthy social and industrial life, every
big corporation should be held responsible by, and accountable to, \ some sovereign strong
enough to control its conduct. lamin no sense hostile to corporations. This is an age of
combination, and any effort to prevent all combination will be not only useless, but in the end
vicious, because of the contempt for law which the failure to enforce law inevitably ' produces.
We should, moreover, recognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected by
corporate agencies in a. country such as ours, and the wealth of intellect, energy and fidelity de
.voted to their service, 'and therefore normally to the service of the public, by their officers and
directors. The corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come to stay. Each
can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long as it does good. But each
should be sharply checked where it acts against law and justice.
of said celebration, and have Issued, in
conformity with Its instructions, Invita
tions to all the nations of. the earth to
participate, by sending their naval vessels

be practicable. This celebration would
fail of its full purpose unless it were en

with the Importance of the event to be

I earnestly hope that this celebration,
already indorsed by the Congress of the
United States, and by the Legislatures of
sixteen States since the action -of the
Congress, will, receive such additional aid
at your hands as will make it worthy of
tho great event it is Intended to cele

STRICTER LAWS NEEDED
TO BAR UNDESIRABLES
Radical Changes Recommended
in the Immigration Statutes
The question of Immigration is ot
vital interest to this country. In the
year ending June" 3o, 1905, there came
to the United States 1,026.000 alien im
migrants. -\u25a0\u25a0 In other words, in the singlo
year that has just elapsed there came
to this country a greater number ot
people than came here during the one
hundred and sixty-nine, years of our
colonial life which . intervened between
the lirst landing at Jamestown and the
Declaration of Independence.
>It is clearly shown in the report of
the Commissioner General of Immigra
tion that while much' of this enormous
immigration is undoubtedly healthy and
natural, , a considerable proportion is
undesirable from one reason or another;
moreover, a considerable proportion of
it, probably a very large proportion, in
cluding: most of the undesirable class,
does not: come here of its own initia
tive/but because of the activity of the
agents of the great transportation com
panies. \u25ba'These agents are distributed
throughout Europe, and by the offer of
all kinds of Inducements they wheedle
and. cajole many immigrants, often
against their. -best Interest, , to come
here."27 \u25a0
The most serious obstacle we have to
encounter , in the effort to secure a
proper regulation -of the immigration to
these shores arises from the determined
opposition of the .foreign steamship
lines who have no Interest whatever
in the matter save to increase the re
turns on their capital by carrying
masses of < immigrants hither in the
steerage quarters of their ships.
As I said ,In my, last message to the
Congress; we cannot have too much
immigration of the , right sort, and we
should have none- whateVer - of the
wrong sort. "Of courseit is desirable
that even the right kind of immigration
should be properly distributed in this
country. We need more of such immi
gration for the South; and special effort
should be made to secure it. Perhaps
it 'would '\u25a0 be possible to limit >.the num
ber of immigrants allowed to come in
any one year to New York and other
northern cities, while leaving unlimited
the number ' allowed to come to the
South; always provided, however, that
a stricter effort is made, to see that only
immigrants . of ; the right kind come to
our country "any where.'
In "â¢: actual practice ;it \u25a0\u25a0 has ' proved so
difficult to enforce the immigration laws
where longr > stretches vof frontier
marked by an Imaginary, line alone in
tervene between us and our neighbor*
that I recommend that . no immigrants
be allowed to come In from Canada and
Mexico/ save natives of , the two coun
tries: themselves./ -
:As \u25a0 much as ' possible should be done
to ' distribute : the ' Immigrants upon the
land = and " keep them - : away from : the
congested t tenement-house ? districts - ot
the great cities. But distribution is a
f>alliative,'not a cure. The, prime need
s to keep out all immigrants who will
not make good Amorican oltleens. The
laws : now existing for' the * exclusion of
undesirable .' immigrants ' . ; should â¢be
strengthened. Adequate means should
be \u25a0 adopted, ; enforced by; sufficient penal
ties, to compel steamship companies
engaged in â¢ the passenger : business 3to
observe in â¢ good faith \u25a0 the "" law \u25a0 which
forbids -them". to encourage or solicit
Immigration vto -the United ' States.
Moreover,, there should be a sharp limi
tation | imposed upon all .vessels coming
to -our ports, as to. the number of immi
grants : in ' ratio ,. to . the '.â¢ tonnage .which'
each vessel can carry. -This ratio ehould
be high enough to insure â¢ the â¢ coming

to the community he should be heartily

another, of 'bne nation or another. We
cannot afford to consider whether he Is
Catholio or Protestant. Jew or Gentile;
whether he Is Englishman or Irishman,
Frenchman or: German, Japanese.
Italian, Scandinavian, Slav, or Magyar.
What we should desire to find out is
the Individual quality of the Individual
man. In my judgment, with this end
in view, we shall have to prepare
through our own agents a far more
rigid inspection in tne countries from
which the Immigrants come. It will be
a great deal better to have fewer im
migrants, but all of the right kind,
than i a great number of Immigrants,
many of whom are necessarily of the
wrong/ kind. As far as possible we
wish to limit the Immigration to this
country to persons who propose to be
come citizens of this country, and we
can well afford to' lnsist upon adequate
scrutiny of the character of those who
are thus proposed for future oltlzen
ship.
There should be an increase in the
stringency of the laws to keep out in
sane. Idiotic, epileptic and pauper Im
migrants. But this is by no means
enough. Not merely the anarchist, but
every man of anarchistic tendencies,
all violent and disorderly people, all
people of bad oharacter. the Incompe
tent, the lazy, the vicious, the physical
ly unfit, defective or degenerate should
be kept out. The stocks out of which
American citizenship Is to be built
should be strong and healthy, sound In
body, mind and character. If it be ob
jected that the Government agents
would not always select well, the
answer* is that they would certainly
select better than do the agents and
brokers of foreign steamship com.
panics, the people' who now do what
ever selection Is done.
EXCLUSION OF CHINESE.
Better Treatment for Exempt*, bat
Coolie* ' Bnrred.
The questions arising in connection
with Chinese immigration stand by
themselves. The" conditions -.In China
are such that the entire Chinese coolie
class, that is, the class ot Chinese la
borers, skilled and unskilled, legiti
mately come under the head of unde
sirable Immigrants to this country, be
cause of their numbers, the low wages
for which they, work and their low
standard of living. Not only is it to the
interest of this country to keep them
out, but the Chinese authorities do not
desire that they should be admitted. At
present their entrance is prohibited by
laws amply adequate to accomplish this
purpose. -These laws have been, .are be
ing, and will be, thoroughly enforced.
The violations of them are so few in
number as to be infinitesimal and can
be entirely disregarded. There is no
serious proposal to alter the immigra
tion law as regards the â¢ Chinese labor
er, skilled or unskilled, and there is no
excuse for any man feeling or affecting
to feel the slightest alarm on the sub
ject.. - Â»
But, in the effort to carry out the
policy of excluding Chinest laborers,
Chinese coolies, grave injustice and
wrong have been done by this nation to
the people of China, and therefore ul
timately to this nation itself. Chinese
students, business and professional
men of all kinds â not only merchants,
but bankers, doctors, manufacturers,
professors, travelers, and the like â
should be encouraged to come here and
be treated on precisely the same foot
ing that we treat students, business
men,- trave'ers and the like of other
nations. ;
Our laws and treaties should be
framed, not so as to put these people
in the excepted classes, but to state
that we will admit all Chinese, except
Chinese of the -coolie class. - Chinese
skilled or unskilled laborers.' There
would not be the least danger that any
such provision would result in any re
laxation of the law about laborers.
These . will, s under . all conditions, be
kept out absolutely. But it will be
more easy to see that both justice and
courtesy ; are shown, as they ' ought to
be shown, to other Chinese, If the law
or -treaty is framed as above suggested.
Examinations should be .completed at
the port of departure from China. For
this purpose there should be provided
a * more adequate consular service in
China- than we now have. The appro
priations, both for the offices of the
consuls and for the office forces In the
consulates, should bo increased."
-As a people we have talked much of
the open door in China, and we expect,
and quite rightly intend to Insist upon,
justice being shownus by the Chinese.
But we cannot expeot to receive equity
unless we do : equity. We cannot ask
the Chinese to do to us what we -are
unwilling to do to them. They would
have a perfect right to exclude our
laboring -men Mr our. laboring v men
threatened to come into their country
In such numbers as to jeopardize the
well-being of the Chinese population;
.and - as, mutatis mutandis, these were
the conditions with which Chinese Im
migration \u25a0 actually brought this peo
ple face to 'face, we had and have a
"perfect right, 'iwhloh:-. the Chinese Gov
ernment In no way contests, to aot as
we \u25a0 have acted in the matter of re
stricting coolie Immigration. That this
right exists (or each country .was * ex
plicitly acknowledged in the last treaty
between thÂ« two countries. ; .
But we â¢ must' treat the Chinese stu
dent, traveler and business man in a
spirit of -the broadest Justice and
courtesy If \u25a0we . expect similar treat
ment to be accorded to our own people
of similar rank who go to China.
â¢ Muoh . trouble has come -' during the

SATISFACTORY RESULTS
OFTHECIVILSERVICE
Iti^Workjngs Warrant; Its Con
tinuation and Extension of
. Its Principles.'
< ;The civil * service law has been on
the statute books for twenty-two years.
Every President and a vast majority of
heads lof \u25a0 departments, who have been
in \u25a0 office I during ; that ; period, have \u25a0 fav
ored a gradual extension of the merit
system.V The more thoroughly its prin
ciples â¢ have .been j understood, the great
er .has; been; the favor with iwhichrthe
law 5- has \ been .regarded . by . administra
tive officers. Any attempt, to; carry on
the \u25a0 great executive ! departments of >, the
Government ;'- without-, this *\u25a0â¢ law '; would
Inevitably result in; chaos.*' The Civil
Service Commissioners are doing excel
lent - work; v and their compensation is
, inadequate, considering thÂ« â¢wvica
they perform.
The statement that the examination*
are not practical la character is based
on a misapprehension of the practice
of the commission. The department
are Invariably consulted as to the re
quirements desired and as to the char
acter of questions that shall be asked.
General invitations are frequently sent
out to all heads of departments asklnÂ»
whether any changes In the scope or
character or examinations are required.
In other words, the departments pre-
Bcrlbe the #requirement 3 and the quali
fications desired, and the Civil Service
Commission co-operates with them in
securing persons with these qualinca
â¢ tlons and Insuring open and Impartial
competition.
In a large number of examinations
(as, for example, those .'or trades posi
tions) there are no educational re
quirements whatever, and a person
who can neither read nor write may
pass with a high average. Vacancies
In the service are filled with reason
able expedition and the machinery- ot
the commission, which reaches every
part of the country, is the best agency
that has yet been devised for finding
people with the most suitable qualifica
tions for the various offices to De filled.
Written competitive examinations do
not make an Ideal method for filling
positions, but they do represent an Im
measurable advance upon the "spoils"
method, under which outside politician*
really make appointments nominally
made by. the executive officers, the ap
pointees being chosen by the polki-'
clans in question, in the great majority
of .cases, for reasons totally aincon
nseded; and it is producing good rÂ»
of the public.
Statistics gathered by the Census Bu
reau show that the tenure or* office in
the Government service does not differ
materially from that enjoyed by em
ployes of large business corporations.
Heads of executive departments and
members of the commission have called
my attention to the fact that the rule
requiring a filing of charges and three
days' notice before an employe could
be separated from the service for in
â¢lflclency has served no good purpose
whatever, because that is not a matter
upon which a hearing of the employe
found to be Inefficient can be of any
value, and in practice the rule* provid
ing for such notice and hearing has
merely resulted In keeping in a cer
tain number of incompetents, because
of the reluctance of heads of depart
ments and bureau chiefs to go through
the required procedure.
Experience has shown that this 'rule
is wholly ineffective to save any man,
If a superior, for improper reasons,
wishes to remove him, and Is mls
chievious because It sometimes serves
to keep in the service Incompetent men
not guilty of specific wrong-dolns.
Having these facts in view, the rufa
has been amended by providing that
where the inefficiency or incapacity
comes within the personal knowledge
of the head of a department, the re
moval may be made without notice, the
reasons therefor being filed and made
a record of the department. The ab
solute right of removal rests where It
always has rested, with the head of a
department; any limitation of this ab
solute right results in grave injury to
the public service. The change is
merely one of procedure; it was much
needed; and it Is producing good re-
The civil service law is being ener
getically and Impartially enforced, and
in the large majority of cases com
plaints of violations of either the law
or rules are discovered to be unfound
ed. In this respect this law compares
very favorably with any other Federal
statute. The question of politics In
the appointment and retention of the
men engaged. In merely ministerial
work has been practically eliminated
in almost the entire field of Govern
ment employment covered by the civil
service law. The action of the Con
gress in providing the commission with
Its own force Instead of requiring It
to rely on detailed clerks has been
justified by the Increased work done
at a smaller cost to the Government.
I urge upon the Congress a careful con
sideration of the recommendations con
tained in the annual report of the com
mission.
NEW COPYRIGHT LAWS.
Present Statues Clumsy and ta 3Teed
of Revision.
Our copyright laws urgently need re
vision.- They are Imperfect in defini
tion, confused and inconsistent In ex
pression; they omit provision for many
articles which, under modern reproduc
tive processes, are entitled to protec
tion; they Impose hardships upon the
copyright proprietor, which are not es
sential-to the fair protection of the
public; they are difficult for the courts
to Interpret and Impossible for the
Copyright Office to administer with sat
isfaction to the publio. Attempts to
improve them by amendment have been
frequent, no less than twelve acts for
the purpose having been passed since
the revised statutes.' -
To perfect them by further amend
ment seems impracticable. A complete
revision of them Is essential. Suoh a
revision, to meet modern conditions
has been found necessary in Germany
Austria. Sweden and other \u25a0 foreign
countries, and bills embodying It are
pending in England and the Australian
colonies. ,It has been urged here, and
proposals for a commission to under
take-It have, from time to time, been
pressed upon the Congress.
The Inconveniences of the present
conditions being so great, an attempt
to frame appropriate legislation has
been made by the Copyright Office,
which has called conferences of the
various Interests especially and practi
cally concerned with the operation of
the copyright laws. It" has secured
from- them suggestions as to the
changes necessary; it - has added from
its own experience and investigations,
and it . has drafted a bill which c em
bodies such of these chang-es and ad
ditions aa, after full discussion and ex
pert criticism, appeared to be sound and
safe. In form this -bill would replace
the existing insufficient and inconsist
ent laws l>y one general copyright
statute. .It will : be presented to the
Congress at the coming session. It de
serves prompt consideration.

I recommend that it be made more strin

Imprisonment in cases of repeated vio

CALIFORNIA THANKED
FOR GIFT OF YOSEMITE
Congress Requested to Provide
for Proper Care of the
* Park.
I call your atentlon to the generous
act of the State of California in con
ferring upon the United States Govern
ment the ownership of the Yosemlte
Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree
Grove. There should be no delay in
eccepting the gift, and appropriations
should be made for the Including â¢ there
of In the Yosemite National Park, and
for the care and pollceir.gr of the park.
California has acted most wisely as
â¢well as with great magnanimity ni the
matter. There are certain mighty natu
ral features of our land which should
bÂ« preserved in perpetuity for our chil
dren and our children's children. In
ray judgment the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado should bo made Into a na
tional park.
It is grreatly to be wished that the
State of New York should copy as re
gards Niagara what the State of Cali
fornia has done as regards the Yosem
lte. Nothing should be allowed to in
terfere f. the preservation of Niagara
Falls in all their beauty and majesty.
If the State cannot see to this then
it is earnestly to be wished that she
should be willing to turn it over to the
National Government, which should in
such case (If possible, in conjunction
with the. Canadian Government) assume
the burden and responsibility of pre
serving unharmed Niagara Falls; just
as it should gladly assume a similar
harden and responsibility for the Yo
semite National Park, and as it has
already assumed them for the Yellow
stone National Park. Adequate provi
sion should be made by the Congress
for the proper care and supervision of
all these national parks. The bounda
ries of the Yellowstone National Park
should be extended to the south and east
to take in such portions of the abutting
torest reservation as will enable th&
Government to protect the elk on their
winter range.
The most characteristic animal of the
western clalns was the great shaggy
maned ox, the bison, commonly
known as buffalo. Small fragments of
herds exist In a domesticated state here
end there, a few of them in the Yellow
stone Park. Such a herd as that on the
Flathead Reservation should not be al
lowed to go out of existence. Eithei
on some reservation or on some forest
reserve like the "Wichita reserve and
frame refuge provision should be made
for the preservation of such a herd. I
believe that the scheme would be of
economic advantage, for the robe of the
buffalo is of high market value, and the
came is true of the rob* of the cross
bred animals.
AID FOR LIFE-SAVERS.
Fensiona Advocated for the Men of the
Service.
I call your especial attention to the
d.ealrabliity of giving to the memberb
of the life-saving service pensions such
as are given to firemen and policemen
in all our great cities. The men in the
life-saving service continually and in
the most matter of fact way do deeds
\u25a0uch as make Americans proud of their
country. They have no political in
fluence; and they live in such remote
places that the really heroic services
they continually render receive the
scantiest recognition from the public
It is unjust for a great nation like
this to permit these men to become totally
disabled or to meet death In the per
formance of their hazardous duty and
yet to give them no sort of reward. If
one of them serves thirty years of his
life. in such a position he should surely
be entitled to retire on halfpay, as a
fireman or policeman dees, and If he
becomes totally Incapacitated through
accident or sickness or loses his health
in the discharge of his duty he or his
family should receive a pension Just as
any soldier should.
I call your attention with especial
earnestness to this matter because It
appeals not only to our judgment but
to our sympathy; for the people on
whose behalf I at k it are comparatively
Jew in number, render incalculable ser
vice of a particularly dangerous kind,
and have no one to speak for tbem.
CARE OF THE INDIAN.
Suppression of Liquor Traffic and More
Schools freed.
During the year Just past the phase
of the Indian question which- has been
most sharply brought to public atten
tion is the larger legal significance of
the Indian's induction into citizenship.
This has made Itself manifest not only
in a great access of litigation in which
the citizen Indian figures as a party,
defendant and in a more widespread '
disposition to levy local taxation upon
his personally, but in & decision of the
United States Supreme Court which
ctrwk away the main prop f on which
has hitherto rested the Government's
benevolent effort to protect him against
the e\ils of Intemperance. The court
holds, Id effect, that when an Indian be
comes, by virtue of an allotment of
land to him. a citizen of the State In
which ble land ie situated, he passes
from under Federal control in such
matters as this, and the acts of the
Congress prohibiting the sale or gift
to him of Intoxicants become substan
tially Inoperative.
It is gratifying to note that the States
and municipalities of the West which
have most at stake In the welfare of
the Indians axe taking up this subject
&ad are trying to supply, In a measure
at least, the abdication of Its trustee
snip forced upon the Federal Govern
ment. Nevertheless. I would urgently
press upon the attention of the Con
jrress the question whether some
amendment of the internal revenue
laws might not be of aid in prosecuting
those rnaJefactors, known In the Indian
country as "bootlegger*." wbo are en- '
raged at once in defrauding the United i
gt&tec Treasury of taxes, and what is
far more Important, In debauching the
Indians by carrying liquors illicitly
Into - territory still completely under
federal jurisdiction.
Among the crying present needs of
'he Indian* are more day schools sltu
ited in the midst of thtlr settlements,
aiore effective instruction in the tn<luc
;rles pursutd on their cwn farms, and
i more liberal extension, of the neld
aiatron service, which means the educa
tion of the Indian women In the arts of
homemcklns;. Until the mothers are
well started In the right direction we
cannot reasonably expect much from
the ctaildrer who are soon to form an
Integral part of our American cltlzen
ehip. Moreover, the excuse continually
ldvancfc3 l>y male adult Indians for re
tusing offers of remunerative employ
ment at a distance from their homes is
â¢.hat they dare not leave their families
".<*> long out of -their sight. One effect
jnl remedy for this state of things Is to
rmploy the minds and strengthen the
moral fiber of the Indian women â the
end to which the work of the field mat
ron Is especially directed. I trust that
the Congress will make: its appropria
tions for. lndian day-schools and field
matrons as generous as may consist
\u25a0Kith thÂ«Â» other pressing demands upon
ts providence, \u25a0 â¢ ;

PEACE UNDER MONROE DOCTRINE.
One of the most effective instruments for peace is the Monroe doctrine, as it has been and is
being gradually developed by this nation and accepted by other nations. No other policy could
have been as efficient in promoting peace ih^e*^yes,tera' : Hemi^kere^iwd J 'in^ving^to. : : 'each
nation thereon the chance to develop along its own lines^ If we had refused to apply the doc
trine to changing conditions it would now be completely outworn, would not meet any of j the
needs of the present day, and, indeed, would probably by this time have sunk into complete
oblivion. It is useful at home, and is meeting with recognition abroad -because #c have
adapted our application of it to meet the growing and changing needs *of the hemisphere.
When we announce, a policy, such as the Monroe doctrine, we .thereby commit ourselves to the
consequences of the policy, and those consequences from time to time alter. It is out of the
question to claim a right and yet shirk the responsibility for its exercise.
ly reduced the amount of agricultural i
products below vyhat was produced in
Spanish times. The war, the rinderpest,
the locusts, the drought and the cholera
have been, united as causes to prevent
a return of the proeperity much needed
In the islands.
The most serious is the destruction
by the rinderpest of more than 75 per
ct-nt of the draft cattle, because it will
take sevtittil years tit breeding to re
store the necessary number of these
!pdisi<cni>al)le aids to agriculture. The
commission atttrnpted to supply-by pur
chase from adjoining countries the
needed cattle, but the experiments
made were unsuccessful. Most of the
cattle imported were unable to with
stand the change of climate and thÂ«.
rigors of the voyage and died from
other diseases than rinderpest.
Tba Income of the Philippine Govern
ment has necessarily been reduced by
reason of the business and agricultural
depression in the Islands, and the Gov
ernment haÂ« teen obliged- to exercise
great economy to cut down -its . ex
penses, to reduce salaries and in every
way to avoid a deficit. It has adopted
an internal revenue law, imposing
taxes on cigars, cigarettes and distilled
liquors, and abolishing the old Spanish
industrial taxes. The luw has not ope
rated as smoothly as was hoped, and
although its principle Is undoubtedly
correct, it may need amendments foi
the purpose of reconciling the people to
Us provisions. The income derived from
It has partly made up for the reduction
In customs revenue.
There has been a marked Increase In
the number of Filipinos employed in
the civil service, and a corresponding
decrease in the number of Americana.
The Government in every one of its de
partments has been rendered more effi
cient by elimination of undesirable ma
terial and the promotion of deserving
public servants. .
Improvements of harbors, roads ana i
bridges continue, although the cutting
down of the revenue forbids the ex
penditure of any great amount from
current income for these purposes.
Steps are being taken, by advertise
ment for competitve bids, to secure the
construction end maintenance of - 10Q0
miles of railway by - private corpora
tions/under the recent enabling legisla
tion of the Congress. â¢
The transfer of the friar lands. In ;
accordance with the contract made
some two years ago, has been com
pletely effected, and- the purchase
money paid. Provision has Just been;
made by statute for the speedy settle
ment in a special proceeding in the
Supreme Court of controversies over
the possession and title of church build
ings and rectories arising between the
Roman Catholic church and schismatics
claiming under ancient municipalities.
Negotiations and hearings for the set
tlement of the amount -due to the Ko
man Catholic church for rent and occu
pation of churches and rectories by the
army of the United States are in prog-
EE; and It is hoped a satisfactory con-,
cluson may be Submitted to the Con
gress before the end of the, session. '\u25a0
Tranquillity lias existed during the
pait year "throughout the Arch pelago
except in the province Â°* CayA^' ,Â«Â£
province of Batangas and the Province
of Bamar,. and In the Island of Jolo
among the Moros. The Jolo disturb
ance was put an end to by several
sharp and ehort engagements, and now
leace prevails In the Moro province.
Cavite. the mother of ladrones In the
Spanish times, is so permeated with the
traditional sympathy of the people -for
ladronism as to make it â¢ difficult to
stamp out the disease. Batangas was
only disturbed by reason of the fugi
tive ladrones from Cavite. Bamar was
thrown into disturbance by the un
educated and partly savage P* o .^ l Â® B . "J"
ins in the mountains, who, having been
given by the municipal code more
power than they were able to exercise
discreetly, elected municipal
who abused their trusts, compelled the
people raising hemp to sell it at a much
less price than it was worth, and by
their abuses drove their people into
resistance 'to constituted authority.
Cavite and Samar are* Instances of re
posing too much confidence in the self
governing power of a people. The dls
furbances have all now been sup
pressed, and it Is hoped that with these
lessons local governments can be
formed, which will secure quiet and
peace to the deserving inhabitants. _
The incident Is another proof of the
fact that if there has been any error
as regards giving self-government In
the Philippines it has been in the di
rection of giving It too quickly, not too
elowly. A year from next April the
first legislative assembly for the Isl
ands will be held. On the sanity and
self-restraint of this body much wiU
depend so far as the future self-gov
ernment of the islands is concerned.
The most encouraging feature of the
whole situation has t>een the very
great interest taken by the common
people in education and the great in
crease In the number *of enrolled stu
dents In the public schools. The In
crease was from 300,000 -to half a mil
lion pupils. /The average attendance is
about 70 per cent. The only limit up
on the number of pupils seems to be
the capacity of the Government. to fur
nish teachers -and schoolnouses. ,
TARIFF AND SHIPPING.
Postponement ' of Application of ' tne
: . Coastwise Laws.
The agricultural conditions of the
Islands enforce more strongly - than
ever the argument In favor of reduc
ing the tariff 'on the products of the
Philippine Islands entering the United
States. ' I earnestly recommend': that
the tariff now Imposed by the Dlngley
bill upon- the products of tne Philip
pine Islands be â¢ entirely removed,Â»ex
cept the tariff -on euerar and. tobacco,
and that that tariff be reduced to 26
per cent of the present rates under the
Dlngley act; -that after. July.. l r 1809,
the tariff, upon tobacco and sugar, pro
duced In the Philippine- Islands 'be en
tirely removed, and that free trade be
tween the Islands and the United States
in the products of each country then be
provided for by law. '. ' _\u0084
A (statute in force, enacted April 16,
1904, -suspends the operation of the
coastwise laws of the United States up
on the trade between : the .Philippine
Islands and the United States until
July 1. 1906. I earnestly recommend
that this suspension be postponed until
July 1. 1809. I think It of doubtful
utility to apply the coastwise Aaws \u25a0_ to
the trade between the United States and
the Philippines under any; circum
stances,-because I am convinced that
i it will do no good whatever to Amer
ican bottoms, and will only Interfere
and be an obstacle to the trade between
the Philippines and the United States;
but if the coastwise law must be thus
applied, certainly It ought not to have
effect until free trade Is enjoyed be
tween the \u25a0 people \u25a0' of; the United States
and the people of the Philippine Islands
; In their respective products. . â¢ â¢
1 1 . do not anticipate that free - trade
between the islands and the United
States will-produce a revolution In the
sugar and tobacco ; production of the
Philippine Islands. So primitive are
the methods of agriculture In : the
Philippine Islands, so slow Is capital. in
going to the islands, so -many difficul
ties surround a large agricultural en
terprise :ln-,the islands, that it .will be

to the admission of Chinese coolie
labor. Hence the only solution Is the
training of Filipino labor," and this will
take a long- time. The enactment of a
law- by the Congress of the United
States making provision for free trade
between the islands and""" tne ''".United
States, however, will be of great Im
portance- from a political and senti
mental standpoint; and while its ac
tual benefit has doubtless been exag
gerated by; thef people of the Islands,
they. will accept this measure of justice
as an indication that the people of the
United States are anxious to aid the
people of the Philippine Islands In
every way, and especially In thui agri
cultural, development of the Archi
pelago. It will aid the Filipino with
out injuring interests. in America. -
PROBLEMS IN HAWAII.
Forts Needed and Coolie Labor Must
Be Kept Out.
In my judgment, immediate, steps
should be taken for the fortification of
Hawaii. This is the most important
point in the Pacific to fortify in order
to conserve the interests of this coun
try. It would be hard to overstate the
importance of this need. Hawaii is too
heavily taxed. Laws should be enacted
setting aside for a period of. say twen
ty years, 75 per cent of the internal
revenue and customs receipts from Ha
waii aa a special fund to be expended
in the islands for educational and pub
lic buildings, and for harbor improve
ments and military and naval de
fenses. \u25a0
It cannot be too often repeated, that
our aim must be to develop the Territory
of Hawaii on traditional American lines.
That- Territory has .serious commercial
and industrial problems to reckon with;
but ' no measure of relief can be con
sidered which looks to legislation ad
mitting Chinese and restricting them by.
statute to field labor and domestic ser
vice. The status of 'servility can never
again be tolerated on American soil. We
cannot concede that the proper solution
of its problems is special legislation ad
mitting to Hawaii a class of laborers de
nied admission to the other States and
Territories. 'There 1 are obstacles, .and
great obstacles, in the way . of build
ing up a representative community - In
the Hawaiian Islands; but It is not in
the American character to give up In the
face of difficulty. Many an American
commonwealth has been built up against
odds equal to those that now confront
Hawaii.
No merely half-hearted effort to meet
ltsproblems as other American com
munities have met , theirs can be accepted
as* final. Hawaii shall never become a
Territory in which. a governing class ot
rich planters exists by means of coolie
labor. Even If the- rate of growth .of
the Territory Is' thereby rendered slower,
the growth, must, only take place by the
admission of Immigrants fit In the end
to assume the .duties and .burdens of full
citizenship.. Our aim must be
to \u25a0 " develop ' the Territory on the " same
basis of stable citizenship' as exists on
this continent. .-,.â¢ .: 'â¢.:.;
CASE OF PORTO RICO.
American Citl senshlp Should . be Con-
ferred on- Natives.
I i earnestly, advocate the -adoption of
legislation which will explicitly confer
American citizenship on all citizens of
Porto Rico. There is, In my Judgment,
no excuse for failure to do this. The
harbor of San-Juan should be dredged
and improved.- The expenses of the Fed
eral court of Porto Rico should be met
from the Federal treasury and not from
the Porto Rican treasury. The elections in
Porto - Rico should take place every - four
years and the Legislature should meet In
session every two years.
. The present form of government In Por
to Rico, which provides for the appoint
ment by the President of the members of
the Executive Council or upper' house of
the Legislature, s has proved satisfactory
end has Inspired confidence in property
owners and investors. - 1 do not deem
it advisable at the present time to change
this form in any material feature. The
problems and needs of the Island are in
dustrial and commercial rather than po
litical. . \u25a0 .
INSULAR INDUSTRIES.
Belter Laws Needed to . Invite Invest
ment of Capital.
I wish also to. call the attention of Con
gress, to one question which affects our
Insular possessions . generally, namely,
the. need of an Increased liberality In th*
treatment of the whole franchise ques
tion In theae islands. In the proper de
sire to prevent the islands being exploited
by speculators and. to have them develop
in .the interest, of their own people an
error has been made in refusing to grant
sufficiently liberal terms to induce the
investment of American capital In the
Philippines and' in Porto Rico. "
Elsewhere, In . ; this message I have
spoken strongly against the . jealousy ot
mere wealth and especially of corporate
wealth as such. But It la particularly re
grettable to allow any. such jealousy to
be developed when we are dealing . either
with our , insular - or : foreign affairs. Toe
big corporation has achieved its present
position In the business world simply be
cause it is the most effective instrument
in business competition. In foreign , af
fairs we . cannot' afford to ! put our people
at a disadvantage with their competitors
by In any way discriminating against the
efficiency :of our business organizations.
In ' the same way we cannot afford to
allow ' our Insular ' possessions to â¢ lag be
hind In Industrial . development from any
twisted Jealousy of business \u25a0 success. -
It Is, of course.' a* mere truism :to say
that the business Interests of the. Islands
will only be developed if . it becomes ,the
financial interest of somebody, to develop
them.; Yet. this development Is one. of the
things most earnestly to be wished for
in the interest of the islands themselves.
We have .been paying all possible heed
to the political and educational ', Interests
of ,, the Islands, ;. but, : Important though
theee objects are, \ It is not less Important
that we should favor their Industrial de
velopment. . >\u25a0 .. . " , . '
The Government can in certain ? ways
help this directly, as by building . good
roads; but - the fundamental ? and " vital
help must be given through the develop
ment ;of the â¢ industries of the Islands,
and a most efficient. means to this end is
to encourage -big. American corporations
to start ; Industriee " in -i them and , this

I also earnestly ask your attention to
the needs of the Alaskan Indians. All In

I recommend that they be immediately

PROGRESS IN THE WORK
ON THE PANAMA CANAL
Money Needed at Once in Order
,:; That Construction May
-. - ; NoiStop^^;J
/The treaty between the United, States
ahd the ' Republic /of Panama,. under
which the construction of the Panama
Canal was made "possible, went* into
effect with Its ratification by the United
States Senate on February 23, 1904. The
canal properties of the French Canal
Company â¢ were transferred to the
United States on April 23, 1804. on pay
ment of $40,000,000 to; that company.
On April 1, J 1905, the commission was
reorganized, and It now consists of
Theodore P. Shonts (chairman), Charles
E. Magoon, Benjamin M. Harrod, Rear
Admiral Mordecal T. Endlcott, Briga
dier General Peter C. Hams and Colonel
Oswald H. Ernst. John F. Stevens was
appointed chief engineer on July 1 last.
Active work in canal, construction,
mainly preparatory, has been In "prog
ress for less than a year; and a half.
During that period two points about the
canal have ceased to be open to debate.
First, the question of route; the canal
will be built on the Isthmus of Panama.
Second, the question \u25a0 of \ feasibility;
there aro no physical obstacles on this
route-that American engineering skill
will not be able to overcome without
serious difficulty, ""\u25a0 or that will prevent
the "completion, of the canal' within; a
reasonable time and at a reasonable
cost. This Is virtually the unanimous
testimony of -the engineers who have

ment.*{," .\u25a0\u25a0_..\u25a0'..' : '~~ r .?y. \u25a0'\u25a0 .... \u25a0.\u25a0:â¢; -\u25a0''\u25a0\u25a0
The point which remains unsettled is
the question of type, whether the canal
shall be one of several locks above sea
level, or. at sea level with a single tide
lock. On; this .point I hope to lay.be
fore the' Congress at an. early day the
findings of the , Advisory Board ,of

CHANGES IN DIPLOMATIC
- AND CONSULAR SERVICE
Should Be More Perfectly Or
ganized and the Salaries
Readjusted.
,1 recommend more, adequate provi
sion than has been made heretofore for
the work of the Department of State.
Within a few years there has been a
very great Increase In the amount and
importance of the work to. be done by
that department, both in Washington
and abroad. This has. been caused. by,
the great increase of our foreign trade,
the increase of wealth among our peq
pla, which enables tbem to travel. more
generally than heretofore, the increase
of American' capital i which is seeking
investment in foreign countries, and
the growth of our power and weight. in,
the councils of the - civilized world.
There has been no corresponding In
crease of facilities for doing the work
afforded to the : department having
charge of our foreign relations.
- Neither at home norabroad is there
a sufficient' working force to do .the
business properly. In : many respects
the system, which was adequate to the
work ot twenty-five, or even. ten, years
ago, Is inadequate now/ and. should be
changed. Our" consular force should be
classified, and appointments should be
made to the several, classes, with , au
thority to the executive to ! assign the
members of each class to duty at such
posts aft the interests -of the service re
quire, instead of the appointments be
ing made as at present to. specified
posts. There should be an adequate in
spection service, so that the department
may be able to inform itself how the
business of each consulate is being
done,- instead of depending upon casual
private information or rumor.
- The fee system \u25a0 should be entirely
abolished, and a due equivalent made
In salary to the officers who now eke
out their subsistence by means of fees.
Sufficient provision should be made for
a clerical force in. every consulate, com
posed entirely of Americans, Instead of
the insufficient provisions now made,
which compels the employment of great
numbers" of citizens of v foreign coun
tries, whoso services can be obtained
for less money. At a large part of our
consulates the office quarters and the
clerical force are inadequate to the per
formance of the onerous >duties Im
posed by the recent provisions of our
Immigration laws as well as by our in
creasing trade. In many parts of the
world the lack of suitable quarters for
our embassies, legations and consulates
detracts from the respect in which our
officers ought to be. held, and seriously
Impairs their weight ana influence.
Suitable provision should be made for
the expense of keeping our diplomatic
officers more fully informed of what is
being done from day. to day In the
progress of our diplomatic affairs with
other countries. The lack of such In
formation, causedv by insufficient ap
propriations available for cable tolls
and for clerical and messenger service,
frequently puts our officers at a great
disadvantage and detracts from their
usefulness. The salary list should be
readjusted. ' It' does not now cor
respond either to the importance of the
service to be rendered and the degree
of ability and experience required in
the different' positions, or to the 'dif
ferences'in the cost of living. In many
cases the salaries. are: qutte inadequate.

ELKINS OFFERS
A COMPROMISE
Senator KegardM as Spokes*
man for Railroads Sug
gests Mild iÃate Bill
WASHINGTON, I^ec. 6.â Senator El
kins, chairman of the Committee on In
terstate Commerce, . after reading the
President's message | to-day, made the
following' statement regarding railroad
rate legislation: . -
As I- understand it, \u25a0 thÂ« President does not
desire to vest in the commission arbitrary and
uncontrolled : power to ' fix rates.' â¢He haa rÂ»
peatedly.' stated that ! tha action of the com
mission In 5 fixing a rate should \u25a0be subject to
review \u25a0by "> thÂ« courts . and . that r the railway
companies should be furnished legal protection
against any injustice., That being the case, a
law giving to the commission power to fix rates
Should not be drawn in such manner as to give
to the commission purely legislative discretion
in fixing rates. It should give, to tha commis
vion power to -change any rite only -If the
existing rate be unreasonable or. otherwise . In
violation of the Interstate commerce act.' and
it should - givÂ« to the commission ' power to
change a rate that Is unreasonable or otherwise
unlawful ocly to the extent that â¢\u25a0 such chacsÂ«
may be necessary in order . to remove the un-Â»
reasonableness or other illegality of the rate.
In other words, it should give, to the commis
sion only, power to reduce a rate to the maxi
mum '. that would be | reasonable | and lawful -if
Originally imposed by the railway company.
A statuta. can" be drawn to effect this result.
If those who advocate vesting In thÂ« Interstate
Commerce Commission -the power to fix rates
are in good faith seeking to carry -.out th#
policy tof the President ther should b* willing
to accept ' a statute giving to the commission
power to fix rates substantially In the follow
ing terms: - . . . â¢' .\u25a0 . ... \u0084, -. ; -. .-.1
"WTienever. any. rate.- fare or charge . fixed
by^ any common carrier, for any service ' shall
be . unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, or
otherwise In violation of any provision of'thtt
tct approved February^ 4 , 1587, entitled 'An
act to, regulate commerce,' or any act amend
atory thereof, the Interstate .'Commerce Com
mission shall have power, after Investigating
the facts i and \u25a0 hearing t hÂ« parties affected, to
make an or<ler modifying such "rate, fare or
charge so far as may be neceesary In order
to ' remove the unreasonableness, unjust dis
crimination or - otheri Illegality \u25a0 thereof; ''. and
such order shall take effect at the expiration
of such time as the commission shall prescribe,
not ' less : than ' â â â - days after publication
thereof." ..-\u25a0\u25a0â¢ ' â¢ * -"-'\u25a0;.'- \u25a0 : 'â¢â¢\u25a0\u25a0'â¢ ' \u0084'*-â¢ -- '.:
"Any party affectÂ«d by such order shall be
entitled to institute a proceeding to- review such
order in the Circuit Court of the -United States
far.; any district | through -which thÂ« line of the
â¢; .carrier . may run, and if . the court >In â¢ such
proceeding . shall . find that . thÂ« rate ; fixtd -\u25a0 by
such carrier was not unreasonable, unjustly

If -the court 'shall 'find that such order modified

either more ; or â¢ less \u25a0 than ! was necessary ' to rs
move the unreasonableness, the unjust disertm-;

The conditions "in China
are such that the entire

is, the class of Chinese la
borers, skilled and un
skilled, legitimately come
under, the head of- unde
sirable immigrants to this
country, because of their
numbers, the low wages
for which they work, and
their low standard of liv

interest of this country to
keep tbem out, but the
Chinese authorities dp not
desire that they : should

purpose. These laws have

California Will Introduce
Japanese Exclusion Bill
Suecial Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
CAIiL BUREAU. I POST BUILDINO.
WASHINGTON. Dec 5.-The plans of the
California Democrats, by which the Re
publican members of the House were to
be _ embarrassed, will be spoiled by the
introduction of a bill to-morrow by Rep
resentative McX inlay extending: the pro
visions of the Chlnele " exclusion law so
as to Include Japanese and Koreans. The
bill has the approval jof the California
delegation and was unanimously agreed
to, by them to-day In caucus.
Information . reached Washington that
the element represented by ex-Represent
ative LJvernaah and Including O. A.
Tveltmoe, Walter . McArthur. and Andrew
Furuseth, was preparing a measure of
import to be ' Introduced by Representa
tive Hearst of New York or some other
Democratic member' with* the hope ap
parently that this would, forestall action
on the part of the Republicans and cause
them to fall In line behind their Demo
cratic brothers.. . , . .
When the California members heard of
thlÂ» alleged purpose they hurriedly called
a I caucus and | appointed McKlnlay, . GH
lette and Hayes as a committee to., draw
up a bill. No dissenting voice was raised
and those present â¢ pledged â¢ themselves to
use ' every effort to secure favorable ac
tion at this session. Both Senators ac
quiesoed in the caucus action. The bill
will be Introduced In the House by Repre
sentative McKinlajr.' '
'It is stated by the members of the dele
gation that there are 60,000 Japanese In
California and nearly 100,000 In the United
States. " During the last ; year more than
8000 Japanese came to this country from
the Hawaiian Islands. Members of the
delegation i say - that the rapid ', Influx of
Japanese ' is regarded as a menace ' \u25a0to
American labor: . The conditions which
inspire this bill are said to be the same
as those which brought about the Chi
nese exclusion act twenty-two years ago.
The bill will extend all of the laws now
in force in the United States and its Ter
ritories, excluding Chinese laborers, to
the i Japanese and Koreans. .

Manchuria, Captain Saunders, arrived
early yesterday morning from the

favored with fine weather, but
Tiroai Yokohama to the island port en- *
countered heavy gales, accompanied by
seas so high that they leaped repeated
ly over the ' Manchuria's lofty sides and
on the forward dock battered things
about Quite extensively.
One sea capsized three tubs of gold
fish and the Chinese sailors had a
merry chase catching those of thg
finny curiosities that were not swept
overboard by the wave which upset the
tubs. Xobody was hurt, the damage
done was not extensive, and in spite of
high seas the Manchuria rolled so lit
tle that it was not necessary to place
racks on the dining tables.
In spite of almost continuous dirty
weather. Chief OScer Morton contrived
io have the liner clean its a yacht when
she came into port, thus maintaining
his reputation as one of the most con
scientious housekeepers in the Pacific

The .Manchuria brought 469 rassen

cargo, which included 692 bales of raw
Bilk. She brought treasure valued at
$150,000.

JUDGE TROUTT
IS CHAMPION
Entitled to the Diamond
i Belt for Biggest Day^s
Work on Judicial Bench
HOLDS â¢ WOELD'S BECOED
Naturalizes 74 , Aliens and
Tries Four Civil Cases
'Twixt Daylight and Dark
"According to the records \of his court
Superior "Judge Troutt Is entitled, to the
diamond belt for celerity In disposing of
important - 1 judicial business. : United
States Secret Serylce Agent Richard H.
Taylor has discovered that bri ! July 29,
1902, Judge Troutt tried j four cases,
one of them before a Jury, a"nd natural
ized seventy-four aliens. .â¢Â»-..\u25a0
In order -to naturalize this number it
was necessary under .-the law to take the
testimony of . three persons ! in each caseâ
that\ of the applicant and his two wit
nessesâmaking: a total of 222 persons.
Allowing : the brief period of ten minutes
for each of * these" seventy-four cases, it
would consume a little more | than twelve
hours of \u25a0 continuous work without .stop
ping a moment for lunch or other re
; freahments. Agent Taylor discovered also
that the minutes ot Judge Troutt's court
for the date mentioned do . not mention
any naturalizations at all. These are en
tered In. the naturalfzatlon" book, and only
a 'few/of-them bear the signature of
Judge Troutt,. he being probably pressed
for time on that day. - -. '\u0084.'.-
.The discovery of this almost superhu
man feat: of judicial industry was made
by Agent Taylor in looking up the natu
ralization' of Andrew Slma, an Italian,
who reported to' the " secret ser\ice f man
that he had lost his papers and wanted
a certified copy of them. Sima, after
having been naturalized on the date men
tioned, immediately appeared as a witness
for five of his countrymen, -who were
also naturalized on tne same day by
Judge Troutt. Â»
Superior Judge Carroll Cook is blamed,
whether rightly or wrongly, by Hans
Michelson. , Hans is a sailor and is under
arrest for perjury, alleged to have been
committed last: .April, while appearing
before Judge, Cook as a witness for the
naturalization of Charles .Hellesto. On
that occasion Michelsqji swore that he
had known Hellesto in this country for
five years, whereas the fact Is alleged
that he had known. Helesto for not more
than three years.. "\. v
In defending himself before Agent Tay
lor Michelson said that. Judge Cook never
asked him as to the length of time he
"had known the applicant; but the record |
shows that the question was asked and
answered. Michelson was put under $3000
bonds by United* States Commissioner
Heacock yesterday and ordered to appear
for examination iat 10 j o'clock this morn
ing. He himself was naturalized on Jan
uary, 1803, by Judge Troutt, his witnesses
being. Frank Johnson and Gustav Holm
gren.'
Jens C. Jensen was brought down, from
Seattle yesterday for trial In the -United
States District Court upon an indictment
charging him with having in . possession
and s using for fraudulent ;â¢. purposes .a
fraudulent ' certificate 'of : naturalization.
His witnesses were . Frank Johnson . and
Gustav Holmgren.' Jensen was taken be
fore United States- District Judge De
Haven - and . pleaded guilty. ; He will be
sentenced this mornlnc. . /
Omund Wendsen . was taken by Agent
Taylor yesterday C before. United States
Commissioner- Heacock, and surrendered
his naturalization papers after admitting
that they had been obtained by the per
jury of Frank Johnson and John P. Han
sen on October 1, IS9S.

\u25a0\u25a0'/^K â¢\u25a0Reasons' Why We
ffl*&M Don't AsK for Money
Lad W UNTIL OUR PATIHITS ARE
jtyfct Cured to Stay Cured
FIRSTâ We have confidence in our ability to
cureall cases coming under the head of OUf
Specialty, which is confined exclusively to
disease and disorders- of MEN ONLY.
SECONDâ We never accept a case until we have
made a thorough examination and feel con-
fident we can cure it.
THIRDâ We do not believe a physician is en-
titled to his fee until he has proven to the
satisfaction of the patient that he can cure him.
FOURTHMDur fee is so small, being only $12. JO,
that we believe any honest man will pay
11 CkllCl IIC Ij L-lilCvl.
FZFTHâ There are so many impostors and un- j
reliable SO-Galled specialists that we believe
our methods will in time prove our superior- 1
ity and hence be the more profitable.
SiXTHâOur enormous practice, built up on these
lines, proves the fact of all our statements.
SEVENTIiâShouId a patient pay us in advance he
.^ might quit treatment before being perma-
nently cured, and our reputation would be
thus jeopardized.
EIGHTHâ ShouId a few dishonest patients refuse
to pay after they are cured, the loss would
be only 51 2.50 each, and we could stand it
with more fortitude than if it were a big fee.
NINTHâ Many honest men without ready money
might otherwise neglect themselves and thus
become /incurable, while our Not-a-dollar-
until-cured motto enables them to take ad-
_ vantage of our special skill and pay .at their
TENTHâ Last, but not least, we desire to reach
the poor as well as the rich man, and by
making our fee only 5J2.50, payable on such
t easy terms, we thereby increase our business
and secure lasting gratitude from thousands
who would otherwise remain afflicted if it
; were not for this liberal offer.
AH of the above reasons we are willing to verify and practically
demonstrate to the most skeptical. Our offer is to you, to every one,
only $12.50 for a cure, payable at your convenience, in such ; sums as
you can spare. Could an offer be more generous? It savors of hon-
esty. It is honest. No matter what your trouble 'is â if you suffer from
neglect, for want of money or from . unskillful practice â here is an op-
portunity to get the services of a skilled specialist, a graduate physician,*
with years ofjripe experience in treating complicated and special dis-
orders of men only. It willcost you nothing to talk to us, and may be
the means of restoring you to health and happiness. Why not call to-
day? Our offices are very private. You see only the doctor. If you
cannot call, write for blanks, as we extend the same liberal offer to those
who cannot call. In fact, there is no excuse for being disordered or
sick while this liberal offer, remains. It is a gift of priceless value,
within the reach of all. Remember, only $12.50 for any disease.

tance. California Wine was ex-dlvidend of 42c

Railroads 4 per cent bonds Is said to be due. to
a proposed 'lncrease In stock and to a possible
additional issue : of . bonds some time hence - for
betterments in the system.-'
In the- mining stocks, which met with the
usual attention, the Comstocks were still-weak
er as a rule. The Tonopahs were Irregular,
some bÂ«ing weaker and .' others firmer. . - - . - \u25a0

A mysterious blaze started In an un
occupied flat at 1251 California street
last night, and before the Fire Depart
ment reached the place the rear of the
building, which Is a three-story struc
ture, was burning briskly. The prop
erty is owned by John C Prlen, who
occupies the first story. The top flat la
occupied by John McXaugrht, manager
of The Call. The barking 1 of a doar at
tracted Miss Prlen to the porch, where

enthusiasm, was converted into an Influence
for higher prices. The speculation broke
through the restraint of the stringent condi
tion of the money market and oractlcally
lmorm the rise in Interest rates and the
working of forces of depletion of bank re
serves. The appearance of the market was
on* of great activity throughout. A large
number of inactive Issues were dealt In. Some
of the stocks of the largest market volume
and which are the usual speculative leaders,
on the other hand, were comparatively 'quiet-
Tbe breadth of thÂ« market may be Inferred
from the fact that advances of a point or over
! were made by something over eighty different
stocks. While the~most conspicuous gains
ware shown by thÂ« obscure class of stocks
thÂ« comprehensive etrength of the market
nevertheless was undeniable. In the great
bn&adth of epeculatlve interest the market was
more notable than any of the year thus far.
The rally In Russian securities abroad was
construed as indicating that the extreme weak
ness of the day before was discounting of
the worst that could be feared In Russia
rather than a reflection of actual conditions.
The result was a renewal of the resort of
local borrowers to the foreign exchange mar
ket for thÂ« relief of money necessities. â¢ Offer
ings of bankers' bills on -iiat account in the
foreign exchange market caused a sharp de
cline In rates. The relief thus secured ' did
not prevent stiff conditions In the local money
market. Rates for call loans were generally
above S per cent from the outset, and there
was Â» flurry again to higher - levels, the rate
touching 15 per cent when the principal sup
plies had be*n exhausted. The ciearing--house
figures , had raided the amount of absorptions
from the banks to $1,890,000 to-day since
the last bank ' etatement. There was also a
deposit at the sub-treasury uf $1,000,000 for
transfer to San Francisco. This brings the
actual reduction In bank cash since the Sat
urday bank, etatement to a higher flfrure than
the then existing Mirplus of reserves over
the 25 per cent legal requirement. The sub
stance of the President's message was pretty
accurately foreseen, but its effect was de
cidedly miscalculated. The terms of depreca
tion of hostility toward railroads or corpora
tions seemed to ameliorate the effect on specu
lative sentiment of the reiterated recommen
dation for railroad rate control and railroad
corporations. The President's suggestion that
legal poÂ»Â«r EBouM be given to permit '.'under
specified conditions and under. careful super
vision a rreenrents rtearly In f avor ; of, - the
public" was fastened-- upon ..-.as.* .pointing to>
authorisation for revival -of railroad pooling.
The effect wÂ«Â» most pronounced in the mem
ber* of tlÂ»*- Vanderbllt sroup and this caused,
conjectures' of â¢ a revival of the plan fur a
merger In that groop. The strong financial
showing In the annual report of the Union
Pacific pave that stock cpecial strength and
rras a - sustairtlnK influence in the whole ot
the railroad list. Call money was broken
from 12 per cent to 6 per cent by offeririgs
from one or the principal banks- at the lower
rate but when these fifnds were taken the
rate rose again to 15 per cent and held at 12
per cent until the closing. Som* . unsettle
mer.t resulted In the final tone of the. market,
but the closing was cenerally strong. .
The bond market vras Irregular. - Total sales,
par value, $3,650,000.
United States Ss and old 4s declined \i per
cent on call.

New York Cotton Market. ; \u25a0 ,
NEW YORK. Dec. s.â ln the ekrly : trading
the \u25a0 market was kept rather heavy, partly by
pressure of eales . by longs, who -\u0084 took profits
because the bureau report - was '\u25a0 out. and by
bears who wanted to depress quotations on the
theory that' the bull news was all known. ..The
market, however, received . rather ; good i eup-'
port and later developed new strength which
ran Into, a, rather sharp advance in the aft**"-,
noon, catching many stop loss orders on | short
coverings and bringing about some rather ur
jgent short covering. , New York shorts were
also reported to be covering in the South. There
was not much news. The future course Of the
market seems to depend now more on the at
titude of the spinning Interests and whether
the glnners' ; report of .the. United States Cen
sus Bureau covering the amount of : cotton
Sinned un to December .1. . which \u25a0Is due -. to
come out next Friday afternoon., will confirm
the Government's low crop estimate. The
forthcoming glnners' report should decide this
question. â¢ - - \u25a0>,'-'
Those who have been predicting 14 and 15
cents for cotton this year are now convinced
that these prices \u25a0. will be â¢ reported, as they
claim * evlnners wlli be forced : to boy and the
South will hold back the rest of the crop and
mark . uo . the price on the Government's \u25a0 low
crop \u25a0 estimate. \u25a0 " *

The feature on the . exchange yesterday was
the sudden advance In ranch Eggs to 45c

was undisturbed. Dealers report all three

closely cleaned 1 up. The . demand for storage
and \u25a0 Eastern Butter ' and ' Eggs Is : said to be
more general than \u25a0 ever before, \u25a0 as the public
ore disinclined to pay the prevailing high prices

SEEKS MATCH
Offers to Meet the Ex-
Champion or to Pit Hart
Against Coming Winner
EDDIE GKAXEY HONORED
Olympic Club Directors Pre
sent Valuable Gold Fob
to Official Referee.
Eddie Graney received a letter from
Tommy Ryan, who is at Benton, Mich..
rÂ«sterday, in which he intimated he
would come West with Marvin Hart to
Â«.ttend the Fltzsimmons-O'Brien fight and
that both he and Hart would be open for
an e:igagement.
The midd'.e-weight champion says he is
heavier than at any time in his varied
career as a lighter, and would like a
match with Fitzsimmons to round out his
ring record. If he cannot get a match he
would like to pit Marvin Hart against the
\u25a0winner of the forthcoming fight. The ar
rival of Ryan and Hart would tone up
the fighting game considerably. ,
Manager Coffroth has many matches in '
view, but with a hostile Board of Super- ]
\u25a0visors in San Mateo County and the situ- .
Â«.tlon for :iext 6eason in this city some
what clouded the prospect is not of the
brightest for the glove artists. Alex
Greggalns is in eclipse just now as a pro
moter, having been assisted out of the
business by Morris I>evy, and there is a |
tendency in some quarters to keep him
out of the game.
Champion Joe Gans is about town look-
Ing as fresh as a peach and waiting to
eign with Mike (Twin) Sullivan. Gans is
so anxious to get a chance to show he is
rot a back number in the ring that Sulli
van can apparently get any reasonable
terms he wants. The Twin was in Los
"Angeles at last accounts and is due here
Â«.t any time.
The directors of the Olympic Club have
made Eddie Graney one of the proudest
of men. For acting as referee at their re
cent tournament they have made him a
present of a valuable gold watch fob. It
Is in the form of a Celtic cross. Woven
through it is a wreath of shamrock, ali
worked out in green. The emblem of tne
Club appears on the face of the cross, the
â¢*O" being worked out in rubies. The fob
Is extremely artistic and reflects credit on
its designer.
"All the talk about Fitzsimmons hands
and feet being bad and next to useless is
Idle rot and nothing but rot," 6ays Leon
Friedman, manager of the lanky spotted
SgMer, who will do his beet to batter the
Beau Brummel of the arena, . Jack
O'Brien of Philadelphia, out of a victory
this month. Continuing Manager Fried
man asserts: â¢'Fitzsimmons Is s. better
man physically to-tJay than O'Brien and
will be as good when be Is 65 years old as~
Philadelphia Jack is now. Bob's hands
*n<l feet are at present in first-class con
dition, and the only time there may be
a possibility of Fitz injuring his hands is
when he- lands on O'Brien. It appears to
me the San Francisco ring followers are
decrying Fitzsimmons because of his
ehowing in his last fight with George
Gardner. They are not aware, or have
evidently forgotten, that when Bob bat
tled with Gardner he was suffering from
a severe cold that bordered on pneu
monia. This prevented him from whip
ping Gardner more decisively. Barring
accidents and sickness Fltz will go Into
the ring against O'Brien in as good trim
as he has ever done."
Harry Chester has been added to Fitz's
training staff as a boxing mate and he
and Billy Bates give the ex-champion of
the world ten lively rounds of glove mix-
Ing every afternoon.
. Attired in a heavy overcoat Bob may
be observed these frosty mornings
stretching his long legs as he trots along
the highways of Alameda. The old red
fighter covers six and ten miles with
Â«asc and upon returning to his training
quarters at Croll's Gardens he undergoes
a vigorous rubdown under the supervision
of Manage Friedman. Harry Chester and
Billy Bates, both heavyweights, are kept
bustling about when they don the mitts
â¢with Fitzsimmons during his workout In
the gymnasium In the afternoon.
Barry to Fisrnt Mike Scnrc-ck.
SAN DIEGO. Doc. s.â Manager Billy
Roche of the National Athletic Club of
this city has completed arrangements
for the next boxing match to be held
on the 19th inst. The principal event
will be between Dave Barry of San
Francisco, wlio is here at present, and
Mike Schreck, vrho lost a match In
Los Angeles to Jack (Twin) Sullivan
gome days since. Schreck claims he
had to tra*n down to make the weight
In that match so much that he was
not 6trong. He will meet Barry at
catch weights and will enter the ring
at about 170 pounds and be strong.

DEFENDS GAME
OF FOOTBALL
College Editor Believes the
Sport Is on a High
Level on This Coast
BLA]O:S SMALL SCHOOLS
Untrained Players and Not
of the Big Elevens
Most Frequently Injured
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 6.â
The official organ of the Stanford stu
dent body, the Daily Palo Alto, has taken
up the question of football and champions
the came in its editorial columns. The
article reviews the arguments as pre
sented by the heads of the universities
and attributes the objections raised by
many of the enemies of the sport mainly
to ignorance of the same. It also agrees
with many of the critics In censuring the
game in the preparatory schools. The
editorial in part follows:
The main argument advanced by the ordi
nary person is that the frame is brutal' and
dangerous to life. It has already been admit
ted that football Is not for weaklings. -. It has
also ceased tÂ» be a child's game, and here Is
where most of the injuries occur. Nine-tenths
of the deaths and serious injuries from football
which are reported every year In enlarged form
In the dally papers reeult to players of high
scb&ols. athletic . clubs and small colleges of
th* rank of a good high school. .
It is here that persons physically unfit to
play are allowed to take part In the game.
There Is no standard of training and In many
cases there Is not a spirit of fair play prevail
ing. It Is In these lower school* where the
reformers can do their beat work. In the
higher colleges the Injuries are comparatively
smaU, and the lasting injuries are practically
nil, at least on this coast. The past record
of our football men will Justify these state
ments. The only noticeable difference between
the football man and the non-participant Is
that the former is generally of superior physi
cal build, partly due to his participation In
the- game. That football of the right kindâ
and this means clean football â develops the
character, has generally been accepted. The
intercollegiate record of California and Stan
ford during the last few years shows small
oj.portunlty for the desirability of a change
In the rules. The conditions In the East,
where the prevailing spirit Is anything to win.
the change that Is most desirable Is the one
of stricter control by the athletic authorities
In tie various universities.
If they would cleanse the sport of ltÂ« profes
sionalism and inttill a spirit of fair play they
could accomplish to a large extent the abolish
ment of the real evil of the game to-day. Stan
ford and California, Instead of being classed
wlta the Eastern colleges in the way the game
is played, stand out as a goal to be reached
by the colleges, which is possible without a
change in the rules. The game, as played
between the two big Institutions of the State,
needs no chance.
COACH LAXAGA.V RETURNS.
In His Opinion Stanford Eleven Com
peres Well With Big Eastern Teams.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dee. 6. â
James F. Lanagan, head football and
baseball coach at Stanford University,
returned to-day from an extended trip
throughout the Eastern States, where
he went to witness the closing big
games of the football season and inci
dentally absorb Eastern ideas on the
game of football. ,
Mr. Lanagan says that in his opinion
Chicago had the fastest football eleven
in the East and outclassed Michigan in
every branch of the game. He further
said that In his opinion Stanford's team
compared favorably with the big elev
ens of the East in so far as speed of
play and effectiveness of formations
were concerned. f
Regarding the present day agitation
to modify or abolish the existing style
of play, Lanagan says that both
Princeton and Yale officials are em
phatic in their opposition to any change
and that Coach Yost of Michigan told
him he considered it within the prov
ince of university faculties, and not
coaches nor players, to advocate any
changes In tUe rules.
LONG DISTANCE CYCLERS
ARE FAR BEHIND RECORD
NEW YORK. Dec. 6.-The tie of the
twelve teams which still remain in the
six-day bicycle race at Madison Square
Garden was broken shortly after mid
night, when the Bedell brothers, riding
as the Long Island team, began a spurt
which finally landed them one lap in
front of their nearest competitors. At 1
a. m. the Bedells, with 837 miles 9 laps,
were two laps ahead.
At 8 o'clock to-night the men were 121
miles behind the record \u25a0 for the .forty
four hours of a six-day contest, which" is
SS9 miles, made by Elkes and McFarland
in 1900.
A feature was. the continuous riding. of
Arthur McDonald of the Galvin and Mc-
Donald combination for nearly nine hours.
Some of the watchers at the trackslde de
clared McDonald was almost twelve
hours on his wheel. This the manage
ment denied, saying such a continuous
stay upon the track would be contrary to
the rules. The riders of the other teams
relieved each other regularly, but Galvin
had been ailing and McDonald pluckily
maintained the team's position for first
honors.
DussoU of the French-Swiss team fell
early to-day and was said to have â¢ frac
tured a rib. He was on the track again
to-night, however, and his manager de
clared the Injury would not prevent his
remaining In the race to the end..

CELERES, WITH RADTKE UP,
BEATS CORN BLOSSOM.
Jake Ward Outruns
a Cluster of
Sprinters.
Titus II Noses Out
Pickaway in a
Hard Drive.
BY FRED K. JIULHOLLAXD.
The most exciting finish at Oakland
track yesterday was reserved for the* con
cluding mile purse run, when Celeres,
ridden by HadUte, wltn the colors up of
Edwin Gaylord, the Denver turfman, de
feated Dr. Rowell's Corn Blossom, the fa
vorite, by a neck, the distance being
covered in 1:40.
Last spring Celeres gave every promise
of developing into a splendid three-year
old, but went amiss, and up to yesterday's
race had failed to show his true form.
Perhaps the riding of Radtke had much
to do with the improvement displayed
by the Maxio colt. Of this there can be
no doubt, for a stronger finisher than
League, astride Corn Blossom, would un
questionably have reversed the positions
of the two horses at the finish! Radtke
took. Celeres out in the lead at the start
and, once in front, RadtKe is a -slippery
young man to overhaul.
JOCKEY RATOKE IS CLEVER.
He unwinds his little ball of yarn with
skill and care, and when it appears as if
his mount would take the count the
Keene lightweight usually has a knock
out left. Loague rode a good race on
Corn Blossom, but Is still a trifle weak
at finishing. The winner was well backed
at 13 to 5. Corn Blossom cut off Salable
on the far turn, after which the latter
fell out of the running. Barney Schrel
ber's Buchanan ran third.
All trace of mud had disappeared and
the track presented a superb appearance.
A large crowd filled the betting ring,
and as but two choices won, the layers
could not complain of, hard times.
Rosaro, a 16 to 1 shot, owned by Billy
Engstrom, the bookmaker, took the in
troductory /two-year-old scramble In a
driving finish from Queen Rec. The lat
ter filly closed equal favorite in the bet
ting with Bertola, the Schrelber entry.
The show went to Lovey Mary. Clark
and Bertola were prominent lor a short
while. .
SUCCEED IS FAVORITE.
Anything ridden by Radtke the book
makers handle with care these days, for
which reason Succeed closed a 7 to 5
chance for the second two-year-old num
ber. The filly won cleverly from j Jlllette,
after trying to run - out on the stretch
turn. J X F, a 30 to 1 shot, ran third. .
Jake Ward, a St. Louis product, played
down from 7 to 18 to 5, proved to be the
mellow one In ,the five and a half fur
long selling affair. Patsy Phillips got
him away sailing; and at the wire he
downed Sir Christopher, a 60 to 1 shot,
quite handily. Frank Neifs Distributor
ran into the show. General Roberts, the
favorite, cracked no Ice whatever.
Played down to 4 to 6, In J the betting
on the mile and a sixteenth selling event,
Possart, the black horse, again ran up
against a stone wall. .Christine A, whose
odds dropped from 6 to 4, made all the
pace, beating the favorite at leisure In
1:47>/i. Fastoso, from the : Baldwin sta
ble and 60 to 1. ran a close third.
By an exceedingly narrow margin only
did Titus II beat Pickaway for the second
five and a half furlong spin.\ The former
sprinter had a slight call in the ring, and
with Lloyd Fountain up. Just nosed
Pickaway out. after the pair had see
sawed almost from the start. Loague
landed the small end of the purse with
Sterling Towers.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Radtke piloted two winners. "
Frank Prior, a capable rider, broke
the ice when he placed Rosaro over the
plate first. '
Dr. Rowell's apprentice Sandy for
tunately escaDed with a slight bruise
or two when Lord Nelson was thrown.
.The two-year-old was caught in a jam
soon after tne start, and \u25a0 Sandy was
tossed over the' fence, landing on the
inside track. ".-''"'.
Jake Ward Is the first horse from the
stable of Lee & i Son to . win a ! purse.

COURSING MEN
ARE RESIGNED
Union Park Officials Will
Not Contest the Action
of San ; Mat eo Supervisors
ENLAEGED STAEES HEEE
Ingleside Management Will
Endeavor to Absorb Air
Greyhounds in Training
The officials of Union Courslny Park
decided at a meeting yesterday not to
attempt to promote coursmy In 'the fa^ji
of the" recent ordinance pasaed by tMfc*
San Mateo County Supervisors prohibit*
tng the sport..
They -w*re informed by their 1-gal ad
viser that the- ordinance was. unconstitu
tional, and that they could secure an In
junction and continue to run -pending lti
final decision In the courts. It was de
cided this would be unsatisfactory, as
the owners of greyhounds and lntendin*
spectators would always be In doubt as
to the. prevailing conditions.
That the - park officials anticipate a
change of heart on the part of the Super
visors within the next few months i 3 indi
cated by the fact that Harry Edell. thi
secretary, has been instructed to maintain
the park office in the Flood building 12.
this city. . James Dennis, superintendent
of the park, has also been instructed to
keep the grandstand, the kennels and the
grounds In good order.
With coursing shut down In Ban Mateo
County the followers of the game across
the line will turn to Ingleside Park. Man
ager O' Shea said recently that If toÂ« "
patronage warranted he ' would promo n
coursing three days In the weekâ on
"Wednesday, Saturday and Sun/lay. This
will tend. to keep up the majority of the
greyhounds in training. It would also
raise the class of the Sunday stakes, aa
the other events would absorb the slower
dogs.
