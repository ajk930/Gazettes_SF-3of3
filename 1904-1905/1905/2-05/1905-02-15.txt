NEW YORK. Feb. 14.â The recent

tertainment given to New York's "400"
by James H. Hyde may have been the
culminating act that has brought about
an almost unanimous desire for his re
tirement from the vice presidency of
the Equitable Life Assurance Society, i
"Mr. Hyde's prominence in various ;
ways and his acts as vice president are
Euch as to tend to provoke criticism of
the society, to create misgivings as to
the conservatism of its management
and to injure the business institution,
â¢which has been uniformly held out to
the public as conducted solely on a
mutual plan for the benefit and pro
tection of its policy holders." :

REPRIMAND
FOR NAVAL
PAYMASTER
â¦ 'â 
Captain Irwin Gets
Into Trouble in
Manila.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING, I
WASHINGTON. Feb. 14.â Paymaster
John Irwin, U. S. N., of San Francisco,
now in Manila, will receive a reprl- j
mand from the Navy Department for j
making a somewhat unseemly spectacle
of himself upon the streets of Manila
as the result of too \ many potations
with friends upon his arrival in the
capital of our island possessions.
Comment was made upon it in the
press of Manila and this caused so
much talk that the commanding officer
was compelled to take notice. As a
result Irwin stands in line for and will
receive a reprimand, but not a court
martial.
It is reported here that one assistant
surgeon of the army, a companion in
the affair, was court-martialed and lost
1 five numbers. Of this the War Depart
i ment states it has no knowledge.
The last court martial of any officer
I in the army medical service was that
'of Captain William W. Quinlan. He
I was count-martlaied in Samar and
I pleaded jruilty upon two counts of con
l duct unbecoming an officer and a
â  gentleman, but not guilty on the gen
eral charges, in which a woman figured.
He was reduced fifty-six numbers in
military rank.
Irwin is to be ordered to duty as
general storekeeper at Cavlte and this
fact effectually disposes of any alle
gation of a serious charge against him.
He has been known as a specially re
served and well-behaved officer. He
is married and his wife is living with
relatives in San Francisco.
Captured Aft<Â«r Fierce light.
BUTTE, Feb. 14. â Sheriff Fenton
and Deputy Sheriff Alston, after a

"Denver" Lane, who a month ago es
caped from Jail at Billings, Mont.
LONDON. Feb. 14.â The first day's
pioceeding in Parliament lent a rather
t'ecided impression in the lobbies that
the Government will manage to hold
out til! the end of the session. The
Governments legislative programme,
which is devoted in the main to social
reforms, will be entirely popular, while
the avoidance of discussions- like that
of the redistribution of seats and Pre
mier Balfour's firmness in thrusting
aside the fiscal problem all will tend
in the same direction.
On the other hand, the Liberals ap
pear to be as distant as ever from any
approach to unanimity on the vexed
question of the leadership. Sir Henry
Cainpbell-Bannerman, Earl Spencer.
Herbert Henry Asquith and Sir Henry-
Hartley Fowier all are spoken of as
probable leaders of the Liberal Minis
try, to say nothing of Lord Rosebery's
even superior claim to that position
should he be inclined to exert his un
doubted influence. Everything will de
pend upon Balfour's success in holding
his followers together and overcoming
the apathy born of the knowledge that
the whole country Is looking for and
expecting a general election.
HISTORIC PAGEANTRY.
The sixth session of the first Parlia
ment of his reign was opened this aft
ernoon by King Edward with all the
historic pageantry which has marked
the ceremony since his accession. The
sovereign himself read the speech from
the throne to the assembled lords and
Commons iv th* upper chamber. The
document was commonplace. The only
reference to the Russo-Japanese war.
which, the King said, "unhappily con
tinues," was the announcement that
"my Government has been careful to
observe in the strictest manner the ob
ligations incumbent upon a neutral
power."
The lengthiest paragraph, devoted to
the Balkans, says the situation contin
ues to give cause for anxiety. The
measures adopted at the Instance of
the Austro-Kussian governments have
been instrumental in bringing about
some amelioration in the state of the
disturbed districts, but "these meas
ures have still to be supplemented by
radical reforms, especially of the finan
cial system, before any permanent im
provements can be effected in the ad
ministration of these provinces of the
Turkish empire." 1
The speech mentioned the interna
tional commission "intrusted with the
investigation of the circumstances con
nected with the disaster to British
trawlers which resulted from the ac
tion of the Russian fleet in the North
Sea, and of apportioning the responsi
bility for this deplorable incident."

INDICATIONS THAT HOCH

Theory a 4 Result of
\ . ' -' VV Identification?.
CHICAGO, Feb. 14.â The police to- |
day put more faith in the theory that)
Johann Hoch is identical with '"Jake" I
Hoffman, janitor of the building '
owned by the wholesale murderer, H.
H. Holmes, in 1893. Three persons
have now positively identified Hoch as
Hoffman. Police Inspector Shippy to
day obtained the names of several ,
others who knew Hoffman and who
will be asked to say whether Hoffman
and Hoch are one.
Hitherto doubt has been cast upon
the assertions that Hoch and Hoffman
are identical because of a belief that
Hoch did not arrive in this country un
til 1895. Seemingly, however, Hoch's
own statement is all the authority they
have for this belief. They have, to the
contrary, the statement of a furniture
dealer here who declares he sold Hoch
furniture in 1891.

WASHINGTON. Feb. 14.â A circular
issued by the War Department to the

received by the t'ecreutry of War from
Representative Littlerielo oi Maine,
relative to the anti-canteen act. and
the Secretary's reply, together with in
structions to officers with respect to
their reDorts on the subject. In his
letter Littleneld states that he is the
author of the anti-canteen amendment
and says:
"I regret to say that an impression
prevails that the officer* of the array
are not only averse to this legislation,
but are prejudiced against it. If this
is true, it has created an unfriendly
atmosphere, which v. ill not only im
pair the efficiency of the recreation and
amusement feature, but will of itself
practically defeat the object of the leg
islation."
Secretary Taft. in reply, said:- .
"I think you tire correct in assuming
that a great majority of the officers in
the 1 army .regard" the anti-canteen
amendment as' ill-advised and as likely,

discovered that the men who are not

terious sourip at the rate of five cents

NEW YORK, Feb. 14.â After two

dent Roosevelt left to-night over the '

The events of to-day Included a recep
tion at the University Club and to
night the event, of his visitâ the dinner
given by . the Hungarian Republican
Club in the restaurant "Little Hun
gary" on the East Side, where a Presi
dent was never before seen.
The fact that Mr. Roosevelt was to
visit places where he has not been
since. he was Governor of New York
and where no other President, while
in office,* had led to unusual police pre
cautions, but nothing untoward oc
curred. '
.From the moment the President's
carriage entered the East Side dia- -
trict he; received an ovation. Never
before had a fraction of the thousands
that cheered him seen a nation's ruler.
KlÂ«ctric lights winked " and blinked
characteristic legends, gaudy buntincr
ll uttered in the wind and the great
EastjSide showed its enthusiasm in
every 'imaginable way. Across Second
avenue, at Sixth street, aj huge electric

roofs and fire escapes in the neighbor
hood and for two blocks on either side
of East â  Houston street a cordon of
police cut oft the 'crowds. , .â¢:â¢"..:â  \..;^.
â  The night was almost the coldest of
the winter, : but it did not \ depress the
spirits of the ( crowd. Before dusk the
East Side streets began to pour forth
their quota bound toward "Little Hun
gary," and these were swelled by sight
seers from all parts of the city, the
latter perhaps more anxious to see the
East Side on a gala night than to catch
a glimpse of the President. East Hous
ton street and adjoining thoroughfares
in all directions were "blocked by as cos
mopolitan a crowd as could be gathered
in . any city In Hie world. The â  throngs-^
were in the best of humor and no dis
order occurred.
;\ Every entrance to a residence or store
within .the police line was guard-- by
an officer, while on housetops opposite
the cafes stood policemen to keep these
vantage r points " clear ;' of any evil dis
posed person. The tenants of the near
by houses had been warned in the aft
ernoon by the police to get home be
fore the lines were drawn, and most of
them appeared to have done ; so.

â¢"â¢ President i "Roosevelt was punctual to

JOHNSON DECLARES WEBER COULD
NOT HAVE DONE MURDER.
DEFENSE IS BEGUN
WITNESS CONTRADICTS HISS CLARK
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Feb. 14.â The defense in
the case of Adolph Weber, accused of
the murder of his mother, Mary
"Weber, opened their case this morning.
Attorney Johnson made a long opening
statement. He said it was the Inten
tion of the defense to introduce oertaln
evidence â which would contradict the
evidence produced by the prosecution
and corroborative of the evidence given
by the defendant before the Coroner's
jury.
â  We Intend to prove." said Johnson,
'that May Clark was not In Brewery
lane on the night of the tragedy and to
show that the only time she saw Adolph
Weber was at the post office that
-.;." ..-â¢':- |
Johnson stated also that the defense
would prove that George Ruth did not J
take little Earl out of the burning
building, but that the little boy was
carried to the window sill by Adolph j
Weber. Johnson further promised to
â few* that the Weber family was alive
at 6:30 cr 6:45 o'clock, and that the de
fendant was down town at 6:35 o'clock.
Johnson declared it was absolutely
impossible for the defendant to have
committed the crime.
The met witness examined was Lot
tie Smith. She testified that she was
living at the "Palace" on Brewery
lane on the night of the tragedy and'
that she knew May Clark.
â¢ Did you see May Clark on the even
ing of the fire and did she say to you
"it's too bad that the house burned.'
that she was a friend of Bertha
Weber's and that she often went there
and had been entertained?" asked
Johnson.
"Yes," answered the witness.
< OVTRADICTS MISS CLARK.
The witness further testified that her ;
rval name was Bertha Gonzales. She ,
said she was walking up and down the
lane at 6:30 o'clock on the night of
November 10 and did not see Adolph \
Weber pass that way. She added that
May Clark had told her that Bertha
Weber used to coax her (the Clark j
woman) up to the house and treat her ;
to icecream and cake.
Myrtle Hall, who also lived at the ;
"Palace," testified that she was present i
hen the Gonzales woman conversed ',
with May Clark.
The testimony given by H. Carr. the j
second-hand dealer who has sworn he
â¢old a . pistol to Adolph Weber, was
then brought into question. Charles A. i
Lowe, Frederick A. Rose and James
Regan, all of San Francisco, testified â 
to the eflect that they knew, Carr and
that his reputation was bad.
Charles Baughan of Ophtr said he
knew George Ruth. He saw him in
Ophir a few days after the Weber fire.
He said he had asked Ruth if he took
the little boy cut in his arms, and that
Ruth replied he had "taken the old :
woman out."
Fred L,utz of Ophlr testified regard
ing his conversation with George Ruth
at hir. On that occasion. Lutz j
stated, he said to George Ruth: "I see j
y<>u have been making a hero of your- !
*xlf by carrying out the boy." Ruth
replied: "Sfo; I did not carry out the
boyâ l carried out the old lady." Lutz
pdded that his relations with Ruth
were friendly.
Fred Rechenmaeher was the witness
by bom the defense expected to prove
conclusively that the revolver was not
in the barn a few days before it was
found. Rechenmaeher said he was the
proprietor of the Auburn brewery and '
â¢was familiar with the Weber premises. j
He told how he had gone to the Weber !
barn to look around for hidden gold. i
He said: "I went into the lower part
of the barn, and as 1 was looking
around I leaned against the sill where
the ; revolver was found by Clarence
'â¢Geear."
"Would it have been possible for you
to have been within a few inches of
where that pistol was and not see It?"
asked Johnson.
"Well. I hardly think that I could
have overlooked It," replied the wit
ness. Â§St3Â§
LOOKING FOR GOLD.
When the witness was asked what he
was doing la the barn he said, "I was
looking for the pile of gold. To tell the
honest truth. I was not looking for
anything else." ... '.". .
When asked why he. was looking there
th" witness got excited and half-rising
in hi? chair pointed his finger at young
Weber, shaking with indignation, and
Raid:
"After this boy had exnreMed his be
lief t'aat I was: the murderer of his
family 1 made up. my mind to get that
cold."
After^ this outburst, Rechenmaeher,
addressing Weber- in a voice trembling
with excitement;'' Â«aid, "I will get you
in your own box." â  - . - i. : '.< -V -'â /.' ,

ited the pawnbroker with Adolph on
the night Henry Carr swore that
Weber purchased the weapon found
under the barn.
C. H. Merrow testified that he was
at the Weber home on the night of
the fire. He said there was a great
deal of smoke in the piano room, and
that he could only see immediately a
short distance. He heard people in the
room, he said, but did not know who
they were.
W. M. Bisbee. a blacksmith, said he
v.as a member of the fire department.
He stated that he saw the defendant
on the front steps of the burning
Weber home on the night of the fire.
He said Weber was in the crowd,
about two-thirds of the way up the
front steps.
ROOM FfJJJb OF SMOKE.
R. J. Hancock said the smoke was
dense in the piano room. It was so
dense, he declared, that when he took
a long breath he got his lungs full of
smoke and had to Jeave the room. He
saw Adolph Weber coming up the
steps. He also said that he had as
sisted in carrying Mary Weber down
the stejis.
Webb asked him, "Were you not ex
cited at swing the sight of burning
bodies?" "Well, I wasn't very much
excited." said the witness, and he
added, "I saw Adolph coming up the
steps before any of the bodies were
taken out; at that time there were
six or eight people on the steps, but
I could not tell who they were."
Mrs. Fred Rechenmacher testified:
"Some time after 6 o'clock on the night
of the tragedy I went out my kitchen
door to hang up my milk pail. I heard
some one playing on the Weber piano
at that time. When I went back into
the house 1 began to play on my own
piano. About twenty minutes after I
heard the whistle of the local train as
it came inoi Auburn."
At The close of the session to-day
Attorney Johnson announced that he
did not think the testimony would be
all in to-morrow, a? he had several
more witnesses to examine. Among
them is Gus Hopper of San Francisco,
who was subpenaed to-nipht.
Whether the defendant is to go upon
the stand is a question which the
attorneys for the defense have not de
cided. Weber to-nigrht stated that he
did not know whether he would go on
the stand. He said he would do so if
his attorneys so desired.
"It all rests with them," he said.

FAIK LOBBY DEFEATED
"Fair Ones' Proper Sphere"
Is Subject of Oratorical
Flights of Legislators
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 14. â Woman's
suffrage was beaten in the Senate this
morning after a short, sharp skirmish
and the lobby that has been busy here
for the last few weeks gathered up
its skirts in astonishment and walked
angrily away. But a small measure
of cheer came to the lobby later when
it was announced that under a motion
for reconsideration by Lynch the bill
has another chance to be revived, but
a very small one, for it was defeated
by a vote of fourteen against twenty
one. As it requires a two-thirds vote
to carry the measure, and it is an
nounced that the fourteen that voted
against it are absolutely firm in their
determination to continue voting "no,"
it is almost certain that the bill is
dead for the session.
Senator Sanford made the principal
address against the measure, saying
that he recognized two spheres of hu
man activity, the one the woman's,
the other the man's. When woman
leaves her sphere, he said, she abdi
cates her throne and throws down her
ecepter of power. Wolfe spoke against
the proposed measure on the same
grounds.
Anderson closed the debate, saying
that though he did not wish to go
the merits of the case, he believed
the voters should be given the right
to say whether or not the women of
the State should be given the right
of suffrage. He did not believe the
Senate should take upon itself a de
cision of the question, but should
leave it to a vote of the people. The
vote on the question was then called,
and it was defeated.
Resolutions adopted by the Com
monwealth Club of California com
mending the suggestions of Governor
Pardee looking to the segregation of
the sources of State revenue from the
sources of local revenue were filed
with the Senate this morning. The
club asks that the Legislature, at its
present session, formulate and order
submitted to the people a constitution
al amendment that will permit this to
be done.
Senator Wolfe's proposed amend
ment to article XX, section 16 of the
constitution, to provide for legislation
farther protecting civil service em
ployes of San Francisco, finally pass
ed the Senate this morning. Keane
of San Francisco spoke at length
against the bill.
It now rrsts with the Governor to say
â¢\\ hether some $400,000 in the treasury
of San Francisco shall be refunded to
those that paid it in. This money Avas
collected under a levy subse
quently declared illegal by the Su
hvome Court. The Senate -declared to
day th.M this 'money -must be refund
ed, its declaration being contained in
the final passage of Treadwell's Assem
bly bill extending the limit of time In
whicfi actions may be filed for the
recovery of taxes illegally paid in three
years.
Curtin's bill appropriating $300,000 for
the construction of a hotel in Yosemite
Valley finally passed the Senate and
went to the Assen.bly. It is believed
the bill will be killed in the house, as
a majority of its members stand
strongly In favor of re-ceding the Yo
s' mite Valley to the Federal Govern
ment and have so voted. '
The jifternoon session was marked by
a spirited debate on the question as to
whether an additional clerk should be
allowed each of the three District
Courts of Appeal, Belshaw offering an
amendment to this effect. The amend
ment carried, and the attaches of the
OOUlt will consist of a clerk at $2400
a year, an assistant clerk at JIBOO, a
Monographer at $IL'OO and a bailiff, at
$1200.
Two proposed amendments relating
to the judiciary were introduced this
afternoon. One provides for the vest
inar of the Supreme Court with juris
diction concurrent with the Legislature
In the impeachment of Superior Judges
for cause. The other seeks to make the
tenure of the office of Superior Judge
for life, dependent alone upon good
behavior and mental competency.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 14.â The As- i
sembly this morning defeated a bill by
Johnstone of San \ Dimas increasing .the
tax ' rate that : Supervisors may levy for
the 5 improvement vof public - roads and
highways from 40 to 60 cents on each
$100. : The measure was defeated vby
Devlin of Vallejo, who made , a speech
on the road situation in the State â¢ that
impressed the Assembly. ...
"I believe as strongly as any ; man in
better roads," said Devlin, "but the
fault ; lies not in the scarcity of ; funds,
but .In : the fact \ that the ' money is not
properly spent. \ If the 40 V cents col
lected were spent right* the State would
have good roads. The system of road
improvement is wrong. I'll confess I
have no remedy to" offer just now, but I
think if this Legislature would , go into
a plan to better the road improvement
system it would accomplish vastly more
for the farmers than it would by in- ,
creasing their taxes. There is scarcely
a section of the State where the farm
ers and other taxpayers are not com
plaining of the roads. I hope to see in
the near future the whole general plan
of the road laws in this State changed
so California will stand out among the j
other States in this respect .as she does ,
in most things else, a leader." jV
The bill limiting the hours â¢: of drug

INVESTIGATORS AT WORK.
Building and Loan Inquiry Is Taken
Tp at Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 14.â The Sen
ate committee appointed to investigate
building and loan associations held a
session to-night. From the trend of
the talk it is evident that the com
mittee is thinking more of getting
points for framing building and loan
association legislation than to pass
upon the merits or demerits of any
company doing business in that line.
The session dragged its tiresome
length to midnight and an adjourn
ment was taken to 7 o'clock to-mor
row night.
James L. Fields, secretary of the
State Building and Loan Commission,
was first called. He was not a voluble
witness and what was obtained from
him was usually drawn out. The fact
that a president of one of the building
arid loan associations had made a loan
of $10,000 on $4000 worth of security
th.ii was claimed to ln< worth $15,000
was recalled to his memory and he
was asked what was the remedy for
such practices. He said a penalty
should be provided for officers of as
sociations making such a loan. He
ssid that perhaps it would be well to
pass a law prohibiting the making of
loans by any director or officer of such
an association. He said he would
recommend the elimination of
premiums and the making of a flat
rate for interest or establishing a
specific number of cents per month
for each $100.
Fields said he did not know of any
association in the State the loans of
which were greater than its securities.
He did not know of any funds being
used contrary to law. The Continental,
of which special inquiry was made, had
never suffered its securities to be mis
used to the best of his knowledge.
Fields admitted that he thought no
more than $1 as an admission fee
should be charged. Several large con
cerns did a good business with the ad
mission fee fixed at that ftgure, he said.
He also admitted that it would be bet
ter if no withdrawal fee at all was
S charged. . ,
Urged to give as a State official
some suggestions for building and loan
legislation, .Fields said the president
and secretary of such concerns should
I be under bends and a State law should
so require. AH payments should be
made by check on a bank. He said in
reply to a query by Hahn that most of
them paid that way now, but because
of the suggestion of tne commission
and not of any law.
The witness said the Waste bill be
fore the Assembly was a good building
and loan measure and that it had been
agreed on by the various companies.
He would have a section added cov
ering co-operative home associations,
! he said.
Clarence Grange was called.
Grange was there for the purpose of
giving suggestions for granting loans.
He gave them straight out. Borrowers
should not be stockholders, he said.
That made them liable for losses and
expenses. All the complaints arose
through stock transactions. Nearly all
building and loan men differed with
him on this point, including Fields. A
contract should be given nxing a defln
its amount of principal and interest so
that not only the borrower, but any
school boy could figure both out. At

was made that the clause which pro

ever, that he has consulted the At

DELAYED OIL MEASURES.
Chairman Dorsry Fails to Call Meet-
ing of Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 14. â Some of
the members of the Assembly Com
mittee on Oil Industries and Oil Min
ing Interests are becoming impatient
over the fatilure of Chairman Dorsey
of that committee to call a meeting.
There are two important oil measures
before the committee, one of them be
ing Dorsey's own measure making oil
l>ipp lines common carriers, and the
other John's bill providing for the
establishment of a State oil refinery.
The session is drawing toward its end
and unless the bills are reported out
soon they will stand no chance of
passage. Dorsey promised to call a
meeting of the committee to-day, but
he was summoned to Bakersfield on
business Saturday night.
the end of a year the borrower should
have his money if he wanted it with
expenses deducted. The certificates
also should be plain and in the body
of the contract should be placed the
amount of dues, penalties and member
ship fees, if any were charged. All
securities should have marked across
their face "Non-Negotiable" so they
could not be hypothecated by any
officials of companies. Contracts
should be so plain, both as to applica
tions and certificate, that the borrower
would know exactly what was agreed
to.
Chairman Woodward instructed Mr.
Grange to be present to-morrow night
to give further testimony, and other
witnesses will be summoned, among
them William Corbin.

ADAMS CLOSES
HIS DEFENSE
Peabody to Again Be Heard
in Gubernatorial Contest
Being Waged in Colorado
END IS XOW IN SfGHT
Report of the Committee to
Be Filed and a Decision
Rendered Early in March
DENVER, Feb. 14.â Governor Alva
Adams closed his defense in the con
test for the office of Governor to-day
and to-morrow the contestor, former
Governor James H. Peabody, will be
gin the presentation of evidence in re
buttal, for which five days are allowed
under the rutes governing the contest.
The legislative committee hearing the
contest is required to report its find
ings to the Legislature on March 1 and
on March 2 the contest will be decided.
To-day was taken up in ltstening to
reports of Democratic experts on ballot
boxes from Huerfano County. The
cress-examination developed the fact
that the experts believed that many of
the ballots written in two or three
handwritings in different precincts
were written by clerks and judges in
assisting illiterates, although the poll
books, save in one or two cases, failed
to show that any assistance was given.
Three experts reported on fifteen pre
cincts in Heurfano County. They tes
tified that 1088 Republican and 162
Democratic ballots out of a total of
2607 votes were written by two or three
persons. Peabody received 1928 and
Adams 62S votes In these precincts.
Should these precincts be thrown out
Peabc-dy would lose 1300 votes.
Under a resolution adopted by the
Colorado House of Representatives to
day a committee of five was appointed
by Speaker Dickson to investigate
charges of coruption and intimidation
made by Representatives J. F. Melton
of San Juan County and Claude E.
Street of Park County, Democrats, in
conection with the eight-hour bilL
County Clerk Montez of Huftrfano
County, who, it was reported, had es
caped from the custody of the ser
geant-at-arms of the committee while
he was being taken to Walsenburg
last night to get the ballot-box from
precinct 23 of that county, appeared
before the committee to-night. Mon
tez produced the much-wanted box to*
night, and when it was opened it was
empty. Montez swore that the box was
received from his predecessor in office
in its present condition, and he could
not account for the absence of the
ballots cast in precinct 23.
REUNION OF STANFORD
GRADUATES IS PLANNED
Gathering Probably Will Take Place
on Date Set for Next Football
Game.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 14.
Stanford is planning to have a
great reunion of all her graduates next
fall at the time of the Intercollegiate
football game. This will be the de
cennial reunion and an effort will be
made to have many of the members
of the pioneer class of 1895 attend.
The idea was first put before the '
university public two years ago by Dr.
Angell, who spoke of it at an assembly
of students. A large committee, headed
by C. M. Fickert of San Francisco,
was appointed to make plans and de- ,
cide on a date. While this, committee
has not yet reported it is probable that
the day of the big football game will
be made the time for the reunion.

It appears that attempts were mad*
to poison former managers of the plan

THINK IT OVEK.
Something You (an See in Any Res-
taurant or Cafe.
A physician puts the query: Have
you never noticed in any large restau-
rant at lunch or dinner time the large
number of hearty, vigorous old men at i
the tables: men whose agree run from 60
to 80 ypars: many of them bald and ail j
perhaps gray, but none of them feeble
or senile?
Perhaps the spectacle is so common
as to have escaped your observation or
comment, but nevertheless it is an ob-
ject lesson which means something.
If you will notice what these hearty
old fellows are eating you will observe
hat they are not munching bran crack-
ers nor gingerly^picking their way
through a menu card of new-fangled
health foods: on the contrary, they
seem to prefer a juicy roast of beef, a
properly turned loin of mutton, and j
oven the deadly broiled lobster is not
altogether ignored.
The point of all this is that a vigor-
ous old age depends upon good diges-
tion and plenty of wholesome food, and I
not upon dieting and an endeavor to
!l\*e upon bran crackers.
There is a certain class of food cranks
â who seem to believe that meat, coffee
and many other good things are rank
poisons, but these cadaverous, sickly- .
' looking individuals are a walking con-
' damnation of their own theories.
The matter, in a nutshell, is that if
the stomach secretes the natural di-
gestive juices in sufficient quantities
any wholesome food will be promptly i
digested; if the stomach does not do bo.
and certain foods cause distress, one or i
two of, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after ,
each meal will remove all difficulty, be- :
<ause they supply just what every;
weak stomach lacksâ pepsin, hydro-
ch'oric acid, diastase and nux.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do not
act upon the bowels, and. in fact, are
not strictly a medicine, as they act al-
most entirely upon the food eaten, di- j
gesting It thoroughly, and thus give a
much needed rest and giving an appe-
tite for the next meal.
Of people who travel nine out of ten
use Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, know-
ing â¢â¢m to be perfectly safe. to use at'
any time and also having found out by j
experience that they are a' safeguard
against Indigestion in any form, and
eating, as they have to. at all hours
and all kinds of food, the traveling
public for years have pinned their faith
to Stuart's Tablets.
All druggists sell them at 50 cents for
full-sized packages, and any druggist â¢
from Maine to California, if his opinion â¢
were asked, will say that Stuart's Dys- !
pepsia Tablets is the most popular, and
successful remedy for any stomach
rouble.

HOUSE CHEERS
FOR SULLIVAN
Massachusetts Congressman
Explains Incident Alluded
To hy William R. Hearst
RECEIVES AN OVATION
Editor Absents Himself and
Leaves a Free Field to
His Fearless Antagonist
WASHINGTON. Feb. 14.â The second
chapter of the episode between Sullivan
of Massachusetts and Hearst of New
York occurred in the House today
when Sulivan again t<x>k the floor upon
a question of privilege and related the
circumstances leading up to the indict
ment and conviction of his father and
himself for manslaughter. In decided
contrast with the remarks of yester
day, when the two men heaped upon
each other epithets and charges of a
serious nature, Sullivan's statement to
day was devoid of any further attack
on his colleague and was a straight
recitation of the occurrence referred to
by Hearst yesterday. Sullivan admitted
the charge, but said that he himself
had only been technically guilty and
was permitted to leave the court a free
man without serving a day's imprison
ment or boing subjected to a fine. His
father had been imprisoned a year and
a half, but, on the introduction of new
evidence, which presented a grave
doubt of guilt, his father had been par
doned. Sulivan said:
The case arose in this manner. My father .
: was the sole proprietor of a . licensed hotel '
known as the General House, in Cambridge. !
i Mass. An Intoxicated man,- .who was not a |
[ guest and had not entered the hotel that day,
â  came to the main door and my father, seeing
! him. shut the door against him. .Thereupon
! the man went around to the back door and S
: broke a window. My father went .out upon .A
[ the street, took the man by the collar and
, demanded that hÂ« pay . for the damage he had
' done. The man responded by striking him
1 and a fight ensued. It Is a fact, and one
j that has never been denied, that no weapons
of any kind were used on either side.. I came j
I up at the time when my father was being ,â¢
I overpowered by this man and took the part
jof my lather in the struggle. The jury found j
1 that the man was knocked down ' by a. blow j
from my father's fist, and. his head striking |
! against the curbstone., became - unconscious.
| There was testimony in the trial of the case I
â  that he never recovered consciousness and
1 died two days after the assault.
; At this conclusion of the trial my father
: was sentenced to three years in the House
!of Correction. The District Attorney, on his j
i own motion, stated to the court that he would ;
ask no sentence against me. as I was but a;
I boy 17 years old. in my first year at the i
! Boston l^aw School, and without any moral :
! guilt in the matter at all; that I was held ,
; solely because I was present and was a party
! concerned in the assault, and was only tech- j
j nically guilty. Accordingly, the court placed .
!my case on file. I- was not . fined one cent i
ior imprisoned one minute. After eighteen i
' months of my father's term had been served |
the Governor's Council of Massachusetts par
doned him and their action was due to the j
fact that two witnesses who did not appear i
at trial in the court came before the Gov- .
ernor's Council and testified, one that he had ,
gone with the deceased to a hotel in Boston
where he obtained liquor and that the , de
ceased came back with him that night â  in- â 
toxicated The other witness testified that dur- ,
-ing the night the deceased got up in his
. house and while proceeding toward the yard
i which adjoined the premises fell down a flight
iof stairs, was then picked up unconscious.
! brought to his bed and remained there with
: out regaining consciousness until he died. 1 his
; raUd a doubt in the minds of the Governor's
Council as to whether the fall upon the curb
â¢etone had caused .the man's death or the fall
down the stairs, most of them, inclininc to -
the view that it was the fall downstairs J
which produced the fracture of the skull that
: resulted In . unconsciousness from which he f
i never recovered. ;
All of the facts, Sullivan said, were
' fully published in all the newspapers in
â¢ the city Boston at the time, and
i were before his constituents when he
! was elected to the Massacnusetts Sen
! ate in 1900 and 1901 and to the Congress
; of the United States In 1902 and 1904; ,
i "and it was not," he said in conclusion. j
: "until twenty, years after that alleged j
offense that any | individual was found |
who felt that it was necessary or
! proper to allude to the circumstances of j
j the case." . â¢ l .
I Sullivan received loud applause from \
. both sides of the chamber when he de- â 
dared that he walked out of court a i
free man and had not been imprisoned
I a day or fined a cent. The applause [
broke out afresh when he declared that
under similar circumstances, if his ,
father were alive, he would go to his j
defense. He took his seat amid renewed j
. applause, several members going to his ,
j seat and shaking his hand.
When Sullivan concluded his Repub
lican colleague, Gardner,' 1 ; feelingly
spoke of his intimate association with
, Sullivan in the Massachusetts Senate.. j
He testified to Sullivan's worth as f a ]
i man and said, . amid great applause, i
! that "there is no man in Massachu- '
; setts to-day for whom I personally 1
would sooner lay down my life and say j
â¢ that the man is honest and above re- j
; proach than Mr. Sullivan." . Hearst â 
S was not present during the time Sulli- j
! van spoke.

' ing a deficiency at the end of the fiscal
I year of from $80,000,000 to $90,000,000, if i
i all the appropriation bills reported be
j come laws, Littleflcld of Maine inquired
i of Foss in the House to-day if it were I
J wise to appropriate in excess of the j
revenues. Foss replied that on general i
principles Congress ought to appro
| priate according to the revenues.
Littlefield- discussed conditions exist
. ing in the Philippines, and said they
; would continue t<> be a veritable Pan
dora's box. He would, he said, vote to
abolish the tariff between the United
States and the Philippines, not because
he believed in free traGe between the
United States and a foreign land, "but
because it is not foreign land."
'The future will determine whether
this altruistic international experience
may," he said, "in the light of history,
be deemed worth while."
The Philippine archipelago, he said.
j so long as retained, would necessitate
large Increases in the army and the
navy.
Japan, he said, is now engaged "in
that hellish trade of war, and ever
since she was driven out of Manchuria
by the brutal concert of the interna- j
tional European powers and Russia left

zeal, energy, ability, patriotism and re
ligious fervor in preparing for the trade
of war."
While It may be wise to keep the open
door with China, he said, he did not
know "how large the stick may need to
be to keep between the door and its
jamb."
Speaking of the South American re
publics, Littletleld expressed apprehen
sion that the United States would soon
er or later be policing them. The Mon
! roe doctrine, he declared, did not go so.
far that the United States must sit
upon the threshold of every South
American republic "and keep the door
open in order that it may cash their
checks or collect the indebtedness of
| any single power."
MAY CUT NEW MEXICO
FROM STATEHOOD BILL
Latest Plan Is to Admit Only Joint
State of Okkihomn and Indian
Territory^
WASHINGTON. FeisT 14. â Confer
ences among members of the Senate
have been in progress to-day looking
to an agreement to accept the decision
of the House on the Statehood bill if
that body should determine upon
amending it to admit only Oklahoma
end Indian Territory as one State and
eliminate all that part which relates
to New Mexico.
The close vote in the Senate over
the proposition to admit Arizona and
New Mexico as one .State seems to
preclude the possibility of an agree
ment in regard to these territories. At
the same time the demand for the ad
mission of Oklahoma and Indian Ter
ritory has been so great that there Is
a disposition to come to an agreement
that would save that portion of the
bill.

BALFOUR AND LANSDOWNE OUTLINE
GREAT BRITAIN'S POLICY.
Colonel Younghusband Rebuked
Continued From Page 1, Column 4.
as last year, that of the Prince of
Wales from Marlborough House con
sisting of three carriages, with an es
cort of Household Cavalry, preceding
by a few minutes the cortege of the
King and Queen from Buckingham Pal
ace. Five state carriages, each with six
horses, bearing state officials preceded
the royal coach with the sovereigns,
drawn by the eight cream-colored Hun
garians which have figured in all the
state precessions or recent years.
Household Cavalry acted as a body
guard, while, in pursuance of their
privilege, a detachment of Yeomen of
the Guard marched alongside the state
coach.
At the royal entrance beneath the
Victoria Tower of the House of Lords
the King was received by the high of
ficers of state and passed in proces
sion to the robing-room. Thence, ac
companied by the Queen, his Majesty
repaired to the House of Lords, pre
ceded by the crown and other regalia,
carried by their hereditary bearers,
and by the heralds announcing the
approach of the sovereigns.
The scene in the gilded chamber on
the arrival of their Majesties was pic
turesque and brilliant. Its small com
pass was crowded to excess with mem
bers of the royal family, peers, peer
esses, Judges, Bishops, Embassadors
and the privileged members of the
House of Commons, who were attired
in the gayest state costumes. The King
seated himself on the throne and com
manded the attendance of the Speaker
and members of the House of Com
mons. On the arrival of the latter the
King arose and read the speech in a
clear, firm voice. The short ceremony
then ended, the Kine" and Queen re
tired to the robing-room, the proces
sion was reformed and their Majesties
returned to the palace over the same
route by which they came.
LANSDOWNK ADDRESSES LORDS.
At the resumption of business in the
House of Lords Lord Chancellor Salis
bury read the King's speech and the
Marquis of Winchester (Conservative)
moved the address in reply.
Earl Spencer, the Liberal leader, re
ferred to the war in the Far East. He
said it was the most earnest desire of
the people of Great Britain to see the
end of the conflict and he trusted his
Majesty's Government would not lose
a fair and proper opportunity to bring
the conflict to a peaceful solution.
Foreign Secretary Lansdowne ex
pressed his sorrow and concern at the
continuance of the war in the Far
East, and said that should an oppor
tunity for bringing it to a close pre
sent itrelf the Government would avail
itself thereof with alacrity; but an at
tempt at intervention now would mean
retarding: the very object desired.
Great Britain had endeavored, not un
successfully, to maintain the strictest
neutrality.
In regard to the most difficult and
embarrassing question of contraband,
the Government, Lord Lansdowne con
tinued, had upheld the wise and time
honored policy of securing the narrow
est possible restrictions of the defini
tion of contraband articles It was
satisfactory to have been able to ar
rive at a reasonable modus vwendi.
Since July not a single British vessel
had been interfered with except where
clearly a blockade runner.
Referring to the North Sea incident.
Lord Lansdowne said that once, and
only once, was the nation near to being
drawn into the vortex of war. He need
hardly say it arose in connection with
the North Sea incident, to which he
only referred because he desired to
acknowledge, the kindly remarks of
Earl Spencer, who had congratulated
the Government upon its conduct of
the negotiations fallowing the Dogger
Bank affair.
MACEDONIAN PROBLEM.
Speaking on the subject of Mace
donia, Lord Lansdowne said there was
a consensus of opinion among the
powers in favor of drastic reforms, anJ
a scheme would be proposed which he
hoped would meet with sympathetic
criticism. The troubles in Macedonia
were not merely a case of Turkish mis
management, which might be ended by
a stroke of the pen, but the conditions
in Macedonia were not equaled in the
civilized world at the moment. Russia
and Austria, upon whom the power 3 |
conferred a mandate to deal with the ;
Macedonian problem, had put forward |
a new scheme of reform, which was
under discussion, but the Foreign Sec
retary was unable to present it in de- .
tail to the House. The British Govern- I
ment was satisfied that it marked a j
step in advance.
Lord Lansdowne also referred to the
Anglo-French agreement. He said It
had been of no little value in settling
many difficulties.
In referring to South Africa the For
eign Secretary said that the British
Government was prepared to give the
Transvaal first, and then the other
colonies, not self-government, but rep
resentative institutions.
Touching upon the Tibetan expedi
tion. Lord Lansdowne said that the at
titude of the Government toward Tibet
had been absolutely consistent. Colonel
Younghusband (the British political
agent who headed the mission) had i
transgressed his instructions when he |
arranged for British forces to remain
in the Chumbi district for seventy-five
years, and this action had been repu
diated by his Majesty's Government.
The Secretary briefly referred to the
naval and military situation, saying
the departments were moving as rap
idly as consistent with wisdom.
In regard to alien Immigration the
Secretary said It was clearly indicated
by the sentiment of the people that the
Government must deal with the situa
tion thoroughly.
In conclusion Foreign Secretary Lans
downe returned to the redistribution I
bill, which he said could not be passed
at the present session.
ASSAILS BALFOUR MINISTRY.
In the House of Commons W. A.
Mount, Conservative, and Samuel Rob
erts, Conservative, seconded the ad
dress in reply to the King's speech. The
first division approaching party lines
occurred when Dalziel, Liberal, moved
that the House censure Lord Arlington
for breach of privilege by his action in
the North Dorset election. Premier
Balfour said nothing could be gained
by continuing the discussion, and
moved the previous question, which
was carried.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the
Liberal leader in the House, speaking
on Mount's motion, bitterly assailed
the Government, which, he said, was
evading the fiscal question, as shown
by the failure of a mover. He said
that the opposition would shortly en
deavor to secure a straight answer
from Premier Balfour showing whether
or not he was in agreement with Jo
seph Chamberlain's proposals. He con
tinued almost up to 7:30 o'clock, when
Sir Edgar Vincent (Conservative) took
up the debate and was speaking when
the House suspended its sitting.
The first hour and a half of the night
session was taken up with desultory
speeches in the debate upon the ad
dress in reply to the speech from the
throne. Premier Balfour rose at 10:30
o'clock to reply to Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman.
JUSTIFIES GOVERNMENT ACTION
Balfour justified the Government's
action in Thibet, saying it was the
Ministry's earnest desire to maintain
the friendliest relations with Afghan
istan.
He touched on Chinese labor in South
Africa and repeated Lord Lansdowne's
pronouncement with regard to the fu
ture of the South African colonies. He
also defended the sugar convention.
Balfour protested against bringing
the fiscal question before this Parlia
ment and said it was entirely irrelev
ant. He was unable, he said, to make
his position clearer than he already had
done. He taunted the opposition on
the existing confusion concerning its
future programme.
The House of Commons adjourned at
11:12 o'clock.
H. H. Asquith will move the follow
ing:
"We humbly represent to Your Maj
esty that the various aspects of the
fiscal question have been fully dis
cussed in the country for nearly two
years and that the time has come for
submitting the question to the peopl*
without further delay."
It is understood the leader* of the
opposition favor discussion of this
question on February 16.

EXCEED APPROPRIATION
Declares Payment of TJniteni
i/cd 1 ills a Willful Wast-,
of the Municipal Filial s
Mayor Schmitz yesterday made a
uemand on Auditor Baehr that he
forthwith reimburse the city for
moneys paid en demands for expenses
oi the Grand Jury in excess of the
budget appropriation which Baehr
audited on court orders. In his com
munication the Mayor characterizes
Baehr's action as illegal and noli** a
him that unless he pays back the sums
so audited hÂ« will take steps to com
pel their payment. The commumca.
non follows: - â -
V- Feb. 14. 1906.
Hoo. Harry B*ehr. Auditor, Cityâ Dear Sir;
1 h*vÂ» your communication of th* 11th last.
It ik my opinion thai your action In auditing
the demand* of the Grand Jury 1Â» clearly ll
legal anrt in contravention both of the st&t
utes of the Etax* and of the charter of the
Am Mayor. I hereby demand of you th* im
mediate reimbursement to the city and oounty
of tan Francisco of the money â¢ illegally paid
on these demands, falling: which I shall cause
toe necessary proceÂ«<iinÂ£e to be Instituted to
enJcrce such reimbursement.
The questions Involved do not &1 all' OOnoarn
the action of the Grand Jury, nor it It my da
nt it. any way to impede Its work in what
ever direction and with whatever motive the
foreman may seek to guide its action.
The Question involved is onÂ», however, that
the citizens of Ban . Francisco are vitally In
terested in, and that question is. "Can the
funds of the city be drawn upon without war
rant of law for the purposes not contemplated
by the city's budget or by its regular appro
priation of funds, and neither recognized nor
allowed by law?"
It appears that some time ago you and the
chairman of the Finance Committee of the i
Board of Supervisors, with other persons, Offi- i
cial and unofficial, agreed, without any con- |
sultation whatever with th 9 chief executive of ;
the city, that you would allow $1000 a month
or more to be taken from the city treasure? I
for Grand Jury expenses, although the limita
tion of expenditure for this purpose was by â 
the annual budget of the city fixed at Just 'â 
one- tenth that amount, to wit: (100 per j
month. . . H
WANTS FTTJL INVESTIGATION.
1 have no objection to the Grand Jury hav
ing the fullest latitude of Investigation; I am
willing that through the proper channels any
necessary moneys should be allowed them for
the most complete examination of every mu
nicipal department, and 1 Include especially
my own office and official acts and the offices
and official acts of any of my appointees, but
such moneys must be allowed only In the reg
ular manner provided for the city's financial
transactions, and not through any secret ar
rangements In private offices, inspired either
by hope of partisan political advantage or by
Â»ny newspaper's desire for revengeful and cor
rupt defamation.
Nor should- such extraordinary and revolu- I
tionary methods of municipal finance be tol- |
'rated as the allowance of unitemlzed bills for I
lump sums for ''personal expenses" which may '
include the champagne quaffed In various i
houses c! ill-fame by certain members of the j
Grand Jury in the course of their "official" ;
investigations; nor is It to be permitted that
when the city has provided suitable rooms at |
the City Hall in which Grand Juries have
held their sessions for many years past, to- j
Esther with all the necessary furniture and â¢â 
paraphernalia, private - buildings - should :
be engaged, new and unnecessary furniture i
purrhased, private attorneys engaged and i
lawbooks bought. at the city's double expense.
The law and the decision to which you have
referred as justifying this unusual and extra- i
ordinary proceeding are in nowise applicable
to the case.
The Grand Jury Is allowed by law (section
S2R, Penal Code) to employ one expert at an
s greed compensation, not to .exceed 16 per
day. tor the purpose of examining the books,
records and accounts of the officers of the
city and county, and for no other purpose.
It ie not authorised* to employ attorneys
who <dl*ruiaed -under the appellation of "ex- 1
perts") have been allowed payment by you,
nor is it authorised to employ an "expert" ar
chitect, whose bill for $258 30 you have al- !
lowed (with probably more to come). You
seek to Justify these Illegal payments and
others by stating that the demands were aud
ited upon orders of the presiding Judge of the
Superior Court.
A Judge of the Superior Court, as you must
certainly well know, has no authority what
ever to order the payments of such demands '
as these. His power to make any order for
the payment* of any demands upon 'the pub
lic treasury depends on the express .'letter of
the statute. Section 14* of the Code of Civil
Procedure reads:
"When Sheriff to provide courtrooms, etc â¢
If suitable rooms for holding the Superior
courts and the chambers of the Judges of
â¢aid courts be not provided In any city and
county, or county, by the Supervisors there
of, together with the attendants, furniture
fuel, lights and stationery sufficient for the
transaction of business, the court, or the
Judges thereof, may direct the Sheriff of the
city and county, or county, to provide such
rooms, attendants, furniture, fuel, lights and
stationery, and the expenses incurred, certified
By the Judge or Judges to be correct' shall
be a charge against the city and county treas
ury and paid out of the general fund thereof
ROOMS WERE PROVIDED.
It Is extremely doubtful whether under these
provisions (and without an appropriation by
the Board of Supervisors) a Judge or court
would under any circumstances have power to
order payment of any expenses of the Grand
Jury; but that question need not be consid
ered here. In this case the Board of Super
visors had provided suitable rooms for the
holding of the meetings of the - Grand Jury
proper allowance* for attendant* . and furni
ture, fuel, lights and stationery sufficient for
the transaction of the business of the Grand
Jury, nor did the court order tne Sheriff to
provide any. â¢â â  â 
The rent of th % prlraU rooms of the MlllÂ«
building Is therefore an Illegal charge the
payment of the furniture for fitting them up

Foreman of Call
Pressrooms
Expires.
William J. Doran, foreman of The
Call pressrooms, died yesterday after
noon at St. Mary's , Hospital from
Bright's disease. Death came rather
suddenly, though the attending physi
cian had given up hope of the man's
recovery since he was brought to the
hospital several days ago.
Doran had been in the employ of The
Call for more than twenty years, dur
ing which time he had never left his
work other than on his regular week
day off. He had for a long time been
a victim of asthma, but it was only re
cently that it became apparent that
the more fatal malady had seized Upon
him. He continued to work until about
a week ago, when he was forced to
seek medical assistance.
Deceased had many friends, whom he
won by his affable manner,
among those- with whom he worked,
who held him In high esteem.
Doran resided with his wife and
6-year-old son at 504 Guerrero street.
His mother, sister and brother, who
live in Sacramento, were immediately
notified of his untimely end, and they
will come here to assist the widow in
the funeral arrangement*.
Dcrran was 45 years old and a native
of Dedham, Mass. He came heTe when
a boy and engaged In newspaper work.
Through bis conscientious work he
gained the highest position that can be
attained in his trade. He wae also a
member of the Pressmen's Union.

PROGRESS OF A NATIONAL
INSTITUTION.
Enormous Figures Dealt in by The
Prudential of Newark.
The twenty-ninth annual statement of The
Prudential of Newark, N. J., which Is pub
lished on another pace, shows the Company to
be stronger financially and In public confidence
than ever before. The year 1904 is reported to
have been one of unusual gains In every de
partment of the Company's business. The
Company Issued and paid for In new Insurance
during the year over 312 million dollars, which
Is the largest of any single year's results In the
Compajiy's history. The number of policies In
force has been increased by over 600 thousand,
bringing tha total number of policies in force
up to nearly six millions. The total amount
of Insurance at risk la over one billion dollars.
In payment to policy-holders The Prudential
has maintained and surpassed Its records for
liberality. During the year ThÂ» Prudential
paid to policyholders over 13 million dollars,
â while since the organization of tha Company
the total payment to ita policyholders has Deen
over 92 million dollars. One Interesting fea
ture brought out In the statement Is the fact
that In caah dividends and other concessions,
not stipulated In original contracts, The Pru
dential has paid to holders of old policies over
5 million dollars. When changes are made In
policy contracts or rates which result In In
creased liberality to the Insured. The Pruden
tial always makes iuch changes retroactive,
wherever It Is practicable to do bo, and the
above payment is the result of this well de
fined policy on the part of the Company.
Nearly 74 million dollars Is held aa reserve
by the Company to protect policy contracts,
end the assets Include a surplus to policy
holders of 413,328,806 83. The complete sched
ule of bonds owned by The Prudential show*
the securities to be of the highest grade. Al
together the statement is on unusually satis
factory one to thÂ« Company and Its polloyhold
Â«TS.
Schur Child In Good Owe.
Judge Coffey had another short
session with the Stoddard-Schur
guardianship controversy yesterday,
and finding that the father of little
Lillle Schur had placed her in the care
of a woman named Bertha Leader,
decided to leave her there for a month
on probation. Fannie Stoddard is the
aunt of the child and wants the
custody. She is the sister of the girl's
mother, who was Schur's second wife.
It appears from the evidence that the
first wife, from whom Schur had been
divorced, began living with him again
three days before the second wife
died. She continued to act as his
housekeeper, and it was said that they
intended to remarry. Yesterday, how
ever, Schur said that he had left the
woman and did not intend to marry
her. This seemed to remove the
chief objection to the child's remain
ing with her father, and the court
would not grant the aunt's petition.
Misses Jeannette and Ethel Newman
have returned from a protracted visit to
the East and will be pleased to receive
their friends at their home, 1707 Octavia
street.

interpreta-tion of some of the most Im
portant characters In the grand operas
presented during the notable season of

His programme contains the works
of Wagner, Verdi, Brahms, Schubert,
Schumann, Richard Strauss, Hugo

Stanford and many other modern com
posers, as well as making a specialty
of the old English, Irish and Scotch
ballads. Blspham will be accompanied
at the piano by Harold Smith.
The sale of reserved seats for the
series of concerts opens this morning

MANY MORE STREETS ARE
TO BE REPAIRED AT ONCE
Board of Works Will Invite Bids for
Work and Also Building of
Beach Parapet.
Commissioner Algeltlnger yesterday
had resolutions prepared for adoption
by the Board of Works at its meeting
to-day inviting sealed proposals for
the repair of bituminous pavements
on the following streets:
Golden Gate avenue, Turk, Eddy,
Ellis, O'Farrell, McAllister, Fulton,
Grove, Hayes, Fell, Oak, Geary and
Post streets, from Van Ness avenue to
Devisadero street; Van Ness avenue
Franklin, Gough, Octavia, Laguna,
Buchanan and Webster streets from
Market to Post; Fillmore, Steiner,
Pierce, Scott and Devisadero streets
from Waller to Post; Page, Haight
and Waller streets from Market to
Devisadero.
Aigeltlnger believes that putting up
contracts for competitive bidding is
the only proper method, although he
ha* been requested to parcel out the
work so that It could be done for sums
less than $400 in each instance, which
would not require advertising. He
hopes to have most of the worst
streets repaired by next July. Con
tracts will also be let to keep Market
street in constant repair.
The Board of Works will also let a
contract for building a parapet along
the beach to the Cliff House for
$4500. The Board of Supervisors
wanted the work done by day's labor
and. had a resolution prepared at last
Monday's meeting, but it was with
drawn because Aigeltlnger showed it
would be more profitable for the city
to enter into a contract for the im
provement. A new resolution to that
effect will be adpoted at next Mon
day's meeting.
OCEANSIDE RESIDENTS SCORE
POLICE COMMISSIONERS
Meeting Held In Carville to Protest
Against Action of Board In
Granting Saloon License.
The Oceanside Improvement Club
I devoted, its attention in a meeting last
! night to the Police Commissioners,
whom the members of the organiza
tion accuse of playing them false in
I the matter of licensing saloon* along
j the Ocean boulevard. The action of
. the board that has aroused the storm
; in Carville is the issuing of saloon 11
/ censes to Charles Dahl and N. C. Ter
williger for downtown places, with
the privilege of transfer to the Ocean
boulevard.
The Improvement Club sent a let
ter to the Police Commission request-
Ing that It be notified whenever an ap
plication for a license on the boule
vard should be proposed, so that its
members might be on hand to oppose
it. The Commissioners replied that
they would send such notice, but
failed to do so and when called to
account said that it was an oversight.
A. G. Clark acted as president and
the following members made short
I speeches: Mrs. Jessie Robertson,
; James Moody, Mrs. Alma Keith, Rich
, ard Barker, Professor W. T. Wenzell,

"I'PURITANI"
GIVES TIVOLI
NEW SUCCESS
The reintroduction of 'I'Puritani" to
a San Francisco audience at the Tivoli
last evening was equivalent to a first
acquaintance to a large majority of
those who filled the opera-house amply
from top to bottom. It is a strenuous
work for those to whom the leading
roles fall, because they have so much
to do. The last opera to be written by
the prollflo Bellini, who turned out
seven in a period of eleven years, and
all before he was 33 years old, it bears
the mark of riper thinking than some
of the earlier works that bear his
name. In contriving means to reach a
satisfactory ensemble effect it is supe
rior to "Norma," which is generally ac
counted to be Bellini's best.
The wonder is that "I'Puritani" Is
not often produced. Tetrazzini found
it a competent vehicle to carry her high
liquid notes, her roulades, her trills. In
its languishing arias she awakened the
customary Tetrazzini storm of enthu
siasm, which extended to Signor Polac
co. Signor Cervi and Signor Romboli
achieved a tremendous success in the
great duet hi the second act, "Sound
the Trumpet Boldly." Signor Colli sang
the music of his role, that of the lover,
with as much tenderness as his per
sistent vibrato would "permit. The chor
us was much used and proved to be
strong and tuneful to a degree.
CABLE CAR CRUSHES LEGS

REGULAR DUTY
FOR ALL WHEAT
Senate Adopts Amendment
of Hansbrough Relative to
Drawback on the Cereal
DEBATE GROWS BRISK
Agricultural Bill Fused
by the Upper House With
but the Single Alteration
WASHINGTON. Feb. 14.â The Senate
to-day passed the agricultural appro
priation bill and took up the District "f
Columbia appropriation bill. Tho
Hansbrough amendment to the agricul
tural bill, relative to the drawbacks on
wheat, was agreed to, after an extended
debate, in which the tariff question
figured to a considerable extent. The
amendment declares that paragraph 234
of the act, which imposes a specitic
duty on wheat, shall not be held to be
affected by section 30 of the same act,
which provides for a drawback on im
ported articles in domestic manufac
ture.
Pettua made the point that the
amendment was out of order, remark
ing, however, that the effect of ths
drawback was to defraud the farmers
and rob the United States Treasury of
its dues. His point was not sustained.
An amendment suggested by Allison
striking out the portion construing the
Intention of the Dingley law and con
fining it to the operation of the law,
was accepted.
"Will the Senator who had much to
do with framing the law say that it
was intended to nullify the provisions
of the duty?"' asked Hansbrough.
Allison replied that it was Intended
that the drawback feature of the tariff
should be greatly enlarged.
Patterson suggested an amendment
making the provision applicable to lead
ores as well as wheat.
"The mining industry is as Important
In some parts of the country as the
milling industry is in others," Patter
son said, "and all that I ask is that that
industry shall have the benefit of the
proposed declaration."
Patterson's amendment was voted
down. Hansbrough's amendment was
agreed to. The bill as amended was
then passed and the District of Co
lumbia appropriation bill taken up.

be Intended to move away.

SENATORS AND CONGRESSMAN MAKE TOUR
OF INSPECTION OF OAKLAND HARBOR.
FLINT, NIXON AND McKINLAY GIVE CLOSE
STUDY TO THE WANTS OF COMMERCE
Desire to Improve All Waterways of State
OAKLAND. Feb. 14.â Several matters
of import to the State developed dur
ing the trip of two United States Sen
ators-elect and one Represer tatlve
el^ct to Oakland to-day. Tbi three
prominent gentlemen were United
f.tates H^riatnr-e'ect F a.ik P. Flint of
California, United estates Senator-elect
George S. Nixon of Nevada and Con
gressman-elect Duncan McKinlay of
the Second District of California. The
occasion w .a the tour of inspection
that Mr. Flint had promised to make
cf Oakland harbor, and Oakland was !
fortunate indeed thai Senator Nixon !
of Nevada and Congressman McKin
lay were jble t<. accompany him.
The matters of importance that de
reloped v ere that Senator Flint, al
though from the southern section of
the SUlte, has become an ardent and
enthusiastic supporter of the reclama
tion of the Sacramento Valley over
' (lowed lands; that he thinks that this
I is the sr^atest. woik which the State
I or Federal governments can possibly
accomplish for California; that he
v.antg Federal builiings for I>os An
geles, San Dietro and Eureka, and that
h^ believes Oa (eland harbor will have
to be developed in order to help San
Francisco stand off the activity of Se
attle in the fight for trans-Pacific com- I
merce. Congressman McKinlay voiced
similar sentiments.
The party that accompanied the dis
tinguished visitors around the bay was
small and was composed only of gentle
men who are able to furnish the infor
mation that the legislators might want.
The reception committee went to San
Francisco early and met their guests
and then conducted them to the water
front, where the cutter Golden Gate, in
charge of Captain J. C. Cantwell,
brought them to Oakland harbor. The
committee consisted of John Mitchell,
chairman of the Alameda County
Board of Supervisors; members of the
Oakland Board of Trade as follows,
James P. Taylor, E. P. Vandercook,
C J. Heeeeman, D. Edward Collins,
M. J. Keller, R. P. M. Greeley, Emil
Lehnhart and Edson F. Adams; A.
Jonas, president of the Merchants' Ex
change, and Wilbur Walker, secretary
of the same organization; E. C. Ses
sions, and G. B. Daniels, the editor of
the Oakland Enquirer. The party was
in the general charge of Edwin
Steams, secretary of the Board of
Trade, who made the arrangements for
the trip. Later in the day the party
wm welcomed at the Country Club by
F. 8. Stratton, Collector of the Port
of San Francisco.
JOHN WERLY SET FREE
FOR ATTACKING LOTHARIO
Onkland Jurors Condemn dough for
Taking Liberties With Another
Mun's Wife.
OAKLAND, Feb. 14. â A Jury de
cided to-day that it was no crime for
John Warty <o attack Fred R. Clough
with a pickhandle one night last No
vember when he found Clough in the
company of Mrs. Werly. It was a
murderous looking weapon Werly
used, but Clough. it was explained,
was a much bigrger man. Though
Werly did no^t want to kill Clough, he
wanted to inflict sufficient injury to
impress the idea of a vigorous protest-
Alter committing the assault he was
arrested on complaint of Clough, who
charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. The Jury was not out
more than long enough to cast one
ballot. There were no dissenting
voices.
The testimony showed that Werly,
who is a middle aged man, had been
made miserable by the attentions paid
his wife. He followed the couple
down town on the night of November
12 and waited outside while they had
cupper in a Ninth street restaurant.
While waiting Policeman Morrison
came along his beat, and seeing Werly
In a doorway, asked him what he was
doing. Werly thereupon told him his
story and asked Morrison what he
would do in the circumstances, espe
cially if the man were bigger than he.
Morrison's reply was, "I would whit
tle him down to my sice and then go
for him." Werly followed the "cop's"
advice in his own way.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1905.
SENATORS-ELECT FLINT AND
NIXO* AND PARTY VIEWING
OAKLAND HARBOR.
During the trip around Oakland
ha/bor Senator Flint was furnished
with maps and photographs and data
sufficient to give him every bit of in
formation that could be nad about the
development of the estuary. James P.
Taylor and E. C. Sessions, berth of
whom have made a study of com
mercial conditions in Oakland, were at
his elbow much of the time, and
pointed out the needs of the land
locked waterway that is now receiving
the overflow of shipping from the con
gested water front of San Francisco.
The work that is now going on near
the mouth of the harbor under the su
pervision of the Government was in
spected, and a trip was made up into
the tidal canal. Senator Flint asked a
multitudafof questions. He .wanted to
know allwf the facts, the kind of ves
sels that came into the harbor and
about facilities for handling them.
Aa the East Oakland basin was
reached some of the enthusiastic Oak
landers turned their attention to Sena
tor Nixon of Nevada and pointed out
to him places that needed improve
ment.
"Yes," caid the Senator from Ne
vada dryly, "I was raised in East Oak
land, used to work in a box factory
over there, used to go swimming off a
wharf down there and have rowed
over every foot of water in this basin."
The party *was then taken to the
Country Club in a special car, where
lunch was served. James P. Taylor
acted as chairman and asked Mayor
Warren Olney, who had joined the
party during the trip, to extend the
welcome of the city to the visitors.
Mayor Olney made a graceful little ad
dress in which he said:
THANKS SENATOR FLINT.
I wlÂ»h to extend the thanks of Oakland to
SAY THEY HOLD
"PADDY IRISH"
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 14.
Albert J. Norton, one of the trio of
men arrested Sunday after a hard pur
suit on susoieion of having taken part
in the theft of money on the Seventh
street local train from J. D. Inlow, has
been identified as John Mackey, said
by the police to be one of the most no
torious and expert professional pick
pockets in the United States. As "Pad
dy Irish," Mackey, the police Bay. holds
a record In the criminal world as an
all-round bad man, as desperate in a
corner as he is clever with his fingers.
The police have definitely settled that
this man is Mackey through positive
information that reached them con*
cerning his movements. He fits the de-^
scriptlon that is on file In the Ban Fran
cisco police department. Mackey's ar
rest will be a comforting bit of news
at every important police headquarters
in the country. Credit for his capture
belongs to Deputy Sheriff William J.
Moffat, who took Mackey and his com
panion In flight, Morris Murphy, at the
corner of Tenth and Oak streets. Mac
key assumed an air of injured inno
cence, declaring he was a tourist from
the East, but he was sent to the City
Prison to await investigation.
The police, through Detective Wal
Senator Flint for his visit to this city. I can
remember back for thirty years, and I have no
recollection of any other (.'nlted States Sena
tor, other than one who Is a citizen of this
city, trying to make an honest investigation
Into what wa* needed here. It is not the de
velopment of Oakland that we are asking.
We are asking that the Federal Government
aid in bringing ship and rail together, and
that In so doing they aid in advancing the
great trade of the Pacific i.icean. In improv
ing Oakland harbor th*y are not alone help-
Ing Oakland; they are helping to bring na
tions" together in trade relations; they are
helping to build up thÂ» State of California;
they are helping to build up the commerce and
trade of Han Francisco harbor.
Senator Flint replied:
REPRESENTS ENTIRE STATE.
When I was conducting my campaign I was
anxious to secure the votes of the Alameda
County delegation, because it represented one
of the best parts of the State. I once told
some one that I had lived lor three years In
Oakland, and advanced that as a reason for
the support that I wanted. That found its
way into the pai>"i!<, and some one came to
me with the remark, "Are we poing to elect |
another Alameda County man to office?" But
I am glad that I have lived here, for I con
sider myself a representative of the entire
State. 1 want to say right here that we have !
one great competitor on this .-oast, and that
Is Seattle. They are struggling for the trade
of the Orient, and California will have to meet
their work. We will have to make San Fran
cisco the great distributing point for this
coast, and If we do that we will have to Im
prove Oakland harbor in order to afford addi
tional (lockage facilities for the already
crowded condition of San Francisco's com
merce. I believe that the modest demands of
Oakland for a harbor are reasonable. But
there Is something else that must be done. We
must look to Sacramento Valley. A proper
system of drainage should be provided for, and
if this is done a million acres of the finest
land in the State ran be made available for
settlement and cultivation. I believe that this
is the. greatest work that faces California to
day. The State and Federal authorities should
work together to this end, and they will al
ways find me a willing helper.
Duncan McKinlay was called upon
and made a most telling address, say
ing:
1 do not represent the Second District
alone â I represent the entire State of Califor
nia â and I believe that the State will never
send to Congress a delegation that will
work with more unity of purpose and deter
mination than the one that has Just been
elected. Few people realize what is going on
Jn California. Railroads are being bjillt In
every direction, river and harbor work is being
carried on, and instead of being on the fron
tier California is now in the center of the
ITnited States. It Is natural that San Fran
cisco Bay should be the great reservoir of the
commerce of the State, and what develop* San
Francieco Bay develops Oakland, and a large
portion of my particular district. There are
800,000,000 people of people In the Orient to
trade with, and T can tell you now, gentlemen
that the development of California has only
Just begun.
At the close of the luncheon the
party Avas taken back to San Fran
cisco by Captain Cantwell on the Gold
en^ Gate.

SENATOR LODGE
GATHERS DATA
Compiles Statement in Sup
port of Action Amending
the Arbitration Treaties
MAKING OUT A CASE
Upper House of Congress
Orders Document Printed
for Public Distribution
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14. â Senator
Lodge presented to the Senate to-day,
in executive session, a list of all the
general and particular arbitration
treaties or arbitration articles of treat
ies containing other provisions that
have been submitted to the Senate.
The Senator has compiled also a Btate
ment showing the constitutional meth
ods of making and ratifying treaties
in certain foreign countries. The state
ment was ordered printed as a public
document.
The disposition of each arbitration
treaty is given in the statement. It
shows that 44 were submitted, of which
43 were ratified and Iâ the Olney-
Pauncefote treaty with Great Britain
rejected. Of the treaties ratified 37
were not amended and 6 were amend
ed. Seven arbitration agreements
have been entered Into without being
submitted to the Senate. All provided
for the settlement of private claims
and were with Brazil, Colombia, Spain,
Mexico (pious fund case), Santo Do
mingo and two with Haytl.
The Dominican case Is that of
the San Domingo Improvement Com
pany, inquired into by Senator Bacon's
resolution introduced yesterday.
The compilation of the laws covering
the ratification of arbitration agree
ments of all the countries with which
the United States has negotiated such
treaties shows that in every instance
the executive must obtain the approval
of at least one and in most instances
both parliamentary bodies, except in
the case of Switzerland, where the par
liamentary body is supreme in treaty
making, the executive having none of
the power, and of Great Britain, where
the King must secure the approval of
a committee of Parliament analogous
with the Foreign Relations Committee
of the Senate of the United States.
The announcement is made by Sen
ator Lodge that he wiil not make any
statement in answer to the letter of
the President which charged that the
ratification of the arbitration treaties
with the amendment adopted was a
step backward and not a step forward.
" Â£o far as I know no one is going to
make a statement on that subject,"
said the Senator.
It is pointed out in administration
circles, in further evidence of the al
legation that the President has sought
to establish no precedent in treaty
making, that under The Hague treaty,
to which the Senate gave its approval,
the executive ha? power to make
special arrangements for arbitration.
Article XXXI of The Hague treaty,
touching this point, reads:
The powers who have recourse to arbitra
tion sign a special act (compromls) in which
the subject of the difference is clearly de
fliKd. as well as the extent of the arbitrators'
powers.
The French word "compromls" used
in The Hague convention is said by
departmental experts to be the equiva
lent not of the English for "com
promise," but rather of the term
"agreement,* and the executive branch
of the Government has proceeded
heretofore and without objection upon
this understanding.
Other conventions similar In terms
and scope to the arbitration treaties
just acted upon by the Senate, which
were in process of negotiating here
between the State Department and
some of the foreign Ministers, have
been completely suspended and the
Japanese treaty signed on Saturday
morning will b? the last on the list.
BRYAN SUPPORTS SENATE.
Proposes Middle Course to Settle
Treaty Clash.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. 14. â Wil
liam J. Bryan was in St. Paul to-day
and called on Governor Johnson at
the Capitol. While there he guve
out an interview on the present con
troversy between the President and
the Senate in regard to the treaty
making power. Bryan said:
I think thÂ« Senate is right in refusing to
surrender its right to ' a voice In making
treaties, and I think the President In error
In making; the action, of the . Senate a basis
of criticism. The very fact that -he refuses
to recognize the right of an opinion so over
whelmingly expressed Is In Itself evidence ' of
the danger of delegating to him the . power
hÂ» asks. '' - -.-..â¢Â»
There Is a basis, however, on which ha
and the Senate might reach an agreement,
and I hope that a reconciliation > may take
place upon this or some other basts.
â  The basis to > which I refer, and which X
have proposed In an editorial. Is that the
President be authorized to submit -. to (The
Hague court for Investigation any and every
question Involving an international dispute,'
the parties to the dispute reserving . the right
to take such action as they deem proper after
the facts are ascertained. i
This would be a broader ; power In one
respect ' than the President asks for . because
It â  would enable him *to put ' on foot an " im
partial Investigation and this - investigation.
by removing misunderstandings and defining
the issue, would result In the settlement of
many Questions which we might hesitate to
submit to arbitration In advance of Investiga
tion. It -would at the same time preserve
the Senate's right to participate In any treaty
or other binding agreement involving the de
cision of an international question.

HARMLESS OLD MAN

buffs the Eccentric Visitor
â Â»
NEW YORK, Feb. 14.â The first at
tempt of an unwelcome visitor to call
upon President Roosevelt since his
arrival in New York occurred early to
day, when an old man who called him
self William Waldorf Jackson, Jr. of
Lowell, Mass., called at the home of
Douglas Robinson, 422 Madison avenue,
where the President stopped for the
night, and asked to have his card seat
to the President. The Secret Service
men and policemen on guard about the
entrance informed the man that the
President had not yet arisen and asked
him to call again. He was not arrested,
but went to a hotel, saying" he would
return later.
In answer to Questions as to his
identity and why he wanted to see the
President, Jackson said he wished to
confer with the President as to reforms
in Govnrnment and that he was a
self -nominated candidate for the Presi
dency in 1896, 1900 and 1904.
"I wished to speak with President
Roosevelt," he said, "with a view to
imparting to him some valuable Infor
mation as to how the office he holds
should be conducted."
Jackson returned to the Robinson
home a second time in about an hour.
He went to a basement door and ad
dressed a detective who was stationed
inside the twisted iron door.
'"Are you the President?" he asked.
"Yes sir. Good morning to you," re
plied the detective.
"Well, do you know, I am William
' Waldorf Jackson Jr. and I am very
anxious to speak with you."
After telling the old man that he was
very busy and that he would prefer to
have him call to-morrow or the day
! following, the detective then bade his
I visitor "good day," and turned into the
i door.
Jackson returned to the sidewalk and
; after expressing his disappointment to
i those standing near, walked slowly
j away, shedding tears as he went.
LOWELL, Mass., Feb. 14.â William
I Waldorf Jackson Jr. is well known in
1 this city, where he has resided for
i many years. He is regarded as an
eccentric but In no respect a dangerous
person.

TAMAGI^
RECORDS
FIVE DOLLARS EACH
TAMAGNO
Is acknowledged to possess the voice of the century. He is
an artist still in his prime ; he is crowned with honors and
there echoes in his ears the acclamation of every capital in
Europe. Tamagno is devoted to his art and so jealous of his
reputation that the most lavish offers of operatic impresarios
all over the world will not tempt him to sing except on spe-
cial occasions for charity.
It was with great difficulty that the Victor Talking Ma-
chine Company succeeded in getting the interview with him
and the opportunity of demonstrating to him the wonderful
results achieved by the modern talking machine, but the dem-
onstration won the battle, and Tamagno entered into a life
contract to sing for the
virTno talking
V l\J 1 V/lV MACHINE
The entire laboratory staff proceeded to Tamagno's pal-
ace, at San Remo, on the Riviera, and for three weeks were
the guests of this great singer. There 'was erected an im-
proved plant especially for the occasion. In his own palace,
in his own good time, at any moment when he felt that it
would be a pleasure to sing and when he was in a mood to do
himself justice, the great singer made the records we now
publish. Think of it! The greatest artist not only of the
last century, but of past generations, this great voice pre-
served for all time to ravish the ear of the music-lover. It is
one of the greatest achievements ever made in the history of
the musical art.
Under these circumstances, is five dollars too much for
one of these records?
Call any time and hear them played.
Our Victor parlors are always at your disposal and for
your amusement.

in the police station at midnight and
said he knew where to find Ferebello.
Three detectives were sent for the
murderer, but he held them off until
the sleuths were reinforced by a patrol
wagon full of officers.
He then hid himself In a closet and
his friends moved a bed against the
door. When the officers pulled out the
bed he placed a revolver to the side of
his head and shot himself.

WATER IN OAKLAND.
THE proposition to bond the city of Oakland for nearly $6,000,000
to buy a theoretical water supply is undergoing quite efficient
discussion over there. The Call has always stood for a definite
policy in respect to municipal socialism by public ownership of public
ties. [f the people want such ownership they are entitled to two
-afeguard? against loss and maladministration. The first of these
bo be had by eliminating competition. It is nowhere regarded as
a proper policy to leave a private competitor in the field. Wherever
;s neglected loss and trouble result.
The other safeguard is found in basing the bonds upon the i
DC they create, leaving the public credit free. Where this is done
c "â¢â =: of the plant and of its maintenance is paid by its users and
' paid in the rate charged to them, and none of it can be
charged to them as taxpayers. When they pay part of it as rate
payers and part of it as taxpayers, the cost is concealed from them
and they have no means at all of knowing the cost of the service.
This plan of making the plant carry its own credit and cost of
linteanoe is generally accepted a? a proper and most necessary
where municipal ownership is undertaken. Especially is it so
in American cities, where it is hard to separate politics and business.
Ie fact that The Call advocated these two safeguards long before
-:land took up municipal ownership does not deter the organ of
municipal socialism in that cfK' from publishing an attack upon what
sophistry" in the matter, nor from imputing to this paper
motives that have no place in its policy.
TT I The Call may not appeal to fanatics nor is it
intended to do so. But that it appeals to business common sense is
evident in the very numerous expressions of business men in our sis
ter city. Our critic says that the seawall bonds rest upon the reve
nues of that improvement, because of a legislative act, submitting
p'zn to a vote of the people, by whom it was ratified. This is
so an indorsement of The Call's position by the people
of' ia. It proves that whenever and wherever the people have
the opportunity they will continue to indorse it. The voters of Oak
land cast a good majority in favor of making the seawall pay its
own bonds.
c them a chance to vote again and they will apply the same
principle to municipal ownership. But it is said by our Oakland
hat "there is no legislation and authority empowering Oak
te bonds based upon the plant they create. Of that we
rVcrlv aware. Nor was there any such authority for the
f the State t<~> vnte upon the seawall bonds until it was legally
red. It can be given to Oakland in the same way in which it
to the State, and when it is Oakland will ratify the views
I all a<; it did by its vote on the seawall.
In the further exposure of our sophistry the critic ssys: "It
bondf be general bonds of the city, then the people must
â¢ interest and provide the sinking fund.'' and the taxpayer
â¢ the municipal water whether he uses it or not."' This
r argument to make in favor of mortgaging the city for
- \ because taxpayers who get no benefit from it must
for it anyway. If the water campaign over there have any ele
amusement in it. this might be put among the humors of the
Then i s no greater violation of natural justice than to
mpel a man to pay for what is of no benefit to him. The reasons
taking non-users pay for a municipal plant are the very
- why the users only should pay for it. They, too. are entitled

c in the tax
Tl < f < )akland have before them now an example of
w * al water management means. They are asked to vote a
I nearly $6,000.000 on their property, but are denied the
know the contract for which it is to be spent! Fair
istice require that such a contract be framed and made,
-atitication by the people. Speaking in behalf of the tax
pa hat city, we deprecate this refusal to let them see the
r which they are to pay. Why they are not permitted to
know what it is. and what it provides for, no one has explained. It
ii eSfM daily hard on those taxpayers who must pay for the proposed
plant, though they will not use it, and is contemptuous treatment of
re.
We care nothing for the corporation that now supplies Oakland
with water, except that it is not good public policy to destroy prop
erty. Xor do we care anything for the corporation which wants to
a non-existing water plant to the city and refuses to let the
people pass upon the contract which would reveal its plans, and its
method of constructing that plant which has no existence at pres
ent. To us it is merely a public question of interest everywhere, to
which we apply business principles that are also general and appli
cable everywhere.
The man or newspaper with nothing to offer but invective and
vituperation may not be followed safely in such matters. Personal
>iisfactory only to the man who uses it as a weapon in
debate. It is the malevolent overflow of a vicious disposition, or the
product of a barren mind. Men of sense are not influenced
by it. and it would be a woeful thing for any city to take its mood
from those who use no other weapon.
A YEAR OF WAR.
WITH the earl}- days of the present month Russia found her
self celebrating the melancholy anniversary of the beginning
of war in the Far East. On the Bth of February, 1904, was
struck that dagger thrust of the Japanese torpedo fleet which gave
ihe Russian fleet at Port Arthur its nrst*downward push to destruc
tion. Now at the end of one year of sanguinary struggle the Czar's
< Government looks about at the wreck of disastrous struggle, and be
tween the potting of its Ministers by sharpshooters at home and the
decimation of its armies by the enemy's bullets in Manchuria, the
Grand Dukes and their underling* at St. Petersburg have little choice
for consolation.
A fleet and the fortress that was impregnable have both dis
appeared. Line-of-battle ships, which insolently ignored all hints
of danger in the gray night of February, have, with their supporting
cruisers and their flotilla of torpedo-boats, been battered to the bot
tom or dispersed into neutral ports, where their several barbs are re
moved by the laws of neutrality. One Russian army and "the Gib
raltar of the East," which it defended, have been wiped out of the
score of opposition. Another Russian army, after having been
forced back through the length of Manchuria, once terribly beaten
at Liaovang, and again defeated at the Hun, now lies inoperative
almost on the border line of Siberia. Korea, which was the original
bone of contention, is so far removed from the theater of war as to
grain no mention in the dispatches ; it is to all intents and purposes a
ft of the Japanese territory. The sea and all that it commands. is
as surely Japanese as if the second Russian fleet, which is skulking
?\<mg the coast of Madagascar somewhere, were taking a practice
cruise among the North Sea trawlers.
Not how badly is Russia beaten, btit how much more beating
does she want, is the question at this year's end of the fighting. The
Czar and his Grand Dukes say that there must be more fighting,
:ch means more beating: the people have recently expressed them
es forcibly to the contrary. The Japanese, meanwhile, are hardly
a party to the dispute. They have merely to wait until the signal is
given that more Russians are on the theater of war and then com
mence operations again.

THE UNEXPECTED
POBERTSON, absorbed In
thought, forgot to tell the con
ductor what street he wished; It
it was only by chance, looking
up, that the awning caught liiÂ»
eye and he tumbled hastily out of the
car. It was snowing hard, and
Robertson, pulling his coat collar
about his ears, mentally reviled him
self for being such a fool as to be out.
But on the dock last evening Mrs.
Preston â there to meet her sister- â
had made a point of his coming, so
here he was. And perhaps he might
learn something of Virginia. It was
a year now since he had been in Amer
ica; In all that time he had heard no
word of the girl. He had little doubt
of how matters stood, however, that
last afternoon when he had gone to
bid Virginia good-by and had met her
driving with Henry Waring; that last
sight of them together had only con
firmed the rumors which for some
time had been flying about. They
were probably married now. This
morning when he had walked past the
house whifh held such bitter-sweet
memories it bore a sign "to let."
Robertson sighed, then plunged up
the steps. The house was brilliantly
lighted. From the rear hall came the
dreamy rhythmic strains of a Hunga
rian orchestra. Garlands of flowers
hung over door and stairway. Robert
son had not supposed it was to be a
large tea.
On entering the drawing room Rob
ertson started violently. The room
was nearly empty, the green bower in
the window was deserted, but the hos
tesa still stood by the door. It was
Virginias mother. Robertson, his
head whirling in a maze, stared as she
greeted him warmly.
"Why, Mr. Robertson, this is indeed
a pleasure, 1 ' she exclaimed. "When
did you return and how did you know
that we had moved?" Robert-son, too
embarrassed to be tactful, flushed.
'â¢Why â why, I fear that I come un
der false pretenses," lie stammered.
"I expected to find Mrs. Preston."
Virginia's mother smiled.
â¢'Then you are one block out of the
way," she explained. "She is in Sixty
ninth street, and this is Sixty-eighth.
But I will not let you go. We have
been celebrating a wedding here to
day, as you see, and you are very wel
come."
"A wedding." repeated Robertson
faintly. He wondered if he looked
queer â if Mrs. Nelson would notice
anything. "And â and Miss Virginia?"
"1 suspect they have all gone into
the dining room," said Mrs. Nelson.
"The ceremony was at four, so the
bride and groom will be leaving short
ly"
Still striving to collect his wits,
Robertson made a slow way to the
dining room. It was only what he
had expected, he told himself angrily.
Why should he care. Yes, there was
Waring, flushed and excited, a great
white cluster of lilies of the valley in
hip buttonhole. The room was filled
with merry young people, laughing
and chatting, but Robertson had eyes
only for the slender, graceful girl who
stood by Waring's side in a gray dress
und big gray hat with soft feathers.

A? she saw him enter, the words died
on the girl's lips, she hesitated, colored
and then came gravely to meet him.
Robertson's heart thumped painfully.
How lovely, how sweet, how alto
gether desirable she looked!
"Is â is it really you?" asked the
girl, a faint tinge of awkwardness in
her manner. "How nice 01 you to
come."
"Isn't it?" agreed Robertson, a trifle
bitterly. "I must go and congratulate
Waring."
She smiled. "Tell me first about
yourself," she said gently. "You are
really back then. And you are going
to stay?"
"I start for Japan to-moiTOw morn
ing." returned Robertson with sur
prising firmness, considering the fact
that the idea had but that moment
found its inception in his brain. "I
â I do not know when I shall return."
"Then this visit is only to say good
by?" asked the girl, bending her head
to inhale the fragrance of the flow
ers she carried. "Yon â you did not
honor us that far before your last de
parture." Robertson flushed again.

SF you want to be happy.
Begin -where you arc.
Don't wait for some rapture
That's future and far.
Begin to be joyous,
Begin to be glad
And soon you'll forget
That you ever were sad.

Begin where you are.
Tour windows to sunlight
And sweetness unbar;
If dark seems the day
Light a candle of cheer,
Till its steady flame brighten*
Each heart that comes near.

the ten commandments by request.
This literary selection is a new thing
in Missouri, and there are indications
that it will have a great run. It is al
ready attracting the attention of some
of the sensational ministers in that
State, and the discovery that the com
mandments are not copyrighted will al
low all the little weeklies to make a
strong feature of them. The best plan
for Missouri would seem to be to run
the ten as a serial and give the people

"I came," he said quietly, "but you
were out. I saw you driving with
Waring. Not surprising under the
circumstances," trying to laugh.
"No," assented the girl. "I â I have
had to be with Hen^y a good deal this
last year or so. I remember now we
went that day to meet my cousin. I
do not know that you ever saw Ma
bel." Robertson shook his head.
"I think not." he said. What wÂ«l
Mabel to him? "I have just been ex
plaining to your mother that I got
into the wrong house." he continued
formally. "Seeing the awning and
the snowstorm must have misled me;
these streets are all very much alike.
So you will pardon me If I go. IâlI â I
wish you all happiness," he added, his
agita.tlon for the moment getting the
better of him. "I am sure you know
that."
Miss Nelson, her lips trembling a bit
wistfully, gaaed back at him. There
was something wrong; she could feel
the vague restraint that hung between
them. Was it due only to his lon*
absence? He had always been a good
friend of hers before that hasty trip
to Europe which summoned him away
last year. Indeed, she had thought,
once or twice â And now he was go
ing away again with the hurt, tired
look in his eyes. Could â could she
not stop him?
"Must you really go?" she asked in
a troubled little voice. "Can't you
even wait to see the bride come
down?"
"The bride!" cried Robertson, "the
bride!" Then suddenly his face
changed, a new light leaped to his
eyes. "What â what do you mean?"
he demanded in a choked, strangled
sort of tone. "Aren't â aren't you the
bride?"
"I?" ejaculated Miss Nelson. "I!"
Robertson's excitement deepened.
"But â but I saw you with him," he
persisted, "and people said â "
Into the girl's look flashed a quick
comprehension, mingled with he could
not tell what other emotions.
"You â you thought that it was I for
whom Henry cared." she gasped. "Oh
â oh. you are mistaken. It Is Mabel;
it has always been Mabel. But â but
she would not listen to him, and for
ages I have been his helper and con
fidant. And so at last he won. She
will be down in a moment if you will
wait â "
Robertson, his breath coming un
certainly, bent forward.
"It â it lies with you," he said, his
voice shaking a little. "Shall I stay?"
For a moment her eyes met his;
then from the hall came the cry, "the
bride! the bride!" Virginia turned and
ran.
Robertson, his heart beating high,
raced after her.
"God bless you. Waring," he called
exultantly. "Good luck to you. Oh,
I say, uhere's the rice?" â (Copyright,

SUCCESSFUL WIFE.

Maybe it is a carnation for his coat

Why, a bunch of violets or a knot

make a man forget that he Is hungry.
A saucy pinch with the usual kiss or

bane, safe and conservative method
that the miner lays down with such
stress as the pickhandle law of pow

fully burned two of the railroad build
ers.
Rock is being blasted away for a
wider roadbed around Land's End. and
the workmen were preparing a blast
when the unusual accident occurred
Michael Coakley, James Laity asd
Robert Neil were engaged in charging
a hole, Coakley being busy at tamping
and Neil standing near him. Laity was
off a short distance opening a powder
can, and to enlarge the opening he had
made with a. knife waa industriously
using the pickhandle.
Suddenly the can exploded and Coak
ley and Laity were enveloped in flames
and their clothing took fire. A great
cloud of sand and dust was raised high
into the air. The two men rolled on
the damp sand, but did not succeed in
extinguishing the names before they
had been burned severely about the
arms, legs and face. Their fellow
workmen came quickly to their aid and
they were conveyed to the Park Emer
gency Hospital, where Drs. Glover and
Millar treated them.
The men are all experienced blast
ers, and they cannot account for the
explosion. Theories of atmospherio
pressure and the like are discussed, but
one conclusion is certain, and that is
that the assurance of safety In open-
Ing a can of blasting powder with a
pickhandle has been shattered, so far
as these rock workers are concerned.
Coakley lives at Fourth and Harri
son streets, Laity at lEI 6 Devisadero

The defendant took the stand and de
nied that he voted as "C. A. Crew" as
alleged. In cross-examination he ad
mitted that he was to be a delegate
to the Union Labor convention and
distributed pasters for that party, but
he voted Republican. On other things
his memory was faulty. Theodore

from specimens of handwriting admit

POWDER FIGHT
SHIFTED AGAIN
Circuit Judge Morrow Is
sues Restraining Order on
Peyton Chemical Company
( O.N SPIRACY CHARGED
Sharp Practice Alleged at
Recent Sale of Delinquent
Stock in 3lills Building
The fierce battle In the DuPont pow
! tier case, which began several months
: ago in the United States Circuit Court
and then shifted to the State courts,
has again shifted to the Circuit Court.
Papers were filed yesterday, and on
motion of Garret McEnerney Judge
Morrow issued an order commanding
William C. Peyton, the Peyton. Chem
i Val Company and others named in the
; bill to appear this mornlngr at 9 o'clock
i and show cause why they should not be
j restrained from acting as officers or di
! rectors, and why a receiver should not
jbe appointed. The order also prohibits
all persons concerned from proceeding
with the annual election of directors.
: The complainant, the E. I. DuPont de
Nemours Powder Company, filed an un
! dertaklng in the sum of $10,000.
In support of the suit and the peti
i tion for the restraining order affidavits
i of Frank Turner, R. S. Pennlman, F.
\ D. Madison and others were filed.
Turner deposes that on December 27,
at 10:30 a. in., Turner, Pennlman and
Madison, each carrying a Back con
i taining $10,000 in gold, and Pennlman
: with an additional sack of $500, went
i into the offioe of the Peyton Chemical
: Company, on the fourth floor of the
â  Mills building, where the sale of delin
; quent stock was to take place. There
I J- P. Wallace read the published no
i tice of the sale and said he would sell
the least number of shares to the per
son who would pay the assessments
and costs due, stating the coats to be
$98 42 for each certificate or lot of 1000
! shares. Thereupon Wallace offered cer
i tificate No. 27 for 1000 shares for sale.
The respondent, Peyton, offered to pay
1 the assessment and costs for the en
: tire lot of 1000 shares, and immediately,
i Mr. Turner deposes, Wallace said
i "Sold!" Penniman offered to pay the
assessments and costs, but Wallace re
fused to give deponent, or any other
person in the room, an opportunity to
hid for said stock, and declared the
Ftock sold to Peyton without repeating
; the bid of Penniman or calling for
other bids. Turner swears that the
actual time consumed from the moment
that Wallace offered certificate 27 for
sale until he declared the same sold to
Peyton was between two and three sec
onds. The other deponents corroborated
, the affidavit of Turner.
The bill recites, among other mat
ters, that on January 16 of this year
the respondents believed that It was the
intention of the complainant to vote
2975 shares for either Penniman and
Turner or Penniman and Oscar Sutro
at the annual meeting of February 16,
and for the fraudulent and wicked pur
pose of preventing complainant from
voting for any but the five respondents
named as directors they amended the
by-laws on that date so as to require
a stockholder to be the owner of at
least 100 shares of stock of the respond
ent corporation in order to be eligible
to the office of director. It is also al
leged that the respondents, with ma
licious and wicked intent, sent their
minute book to New Tork for the pur
pose of surprising the complainant with
said amendment at the annual election
j on February 16.
It is alleged also that on January S
of this year William C. Peyton pretend
! Ed to transfer to Bernard Peyton 100
: shares and to A. M. Hunt a like num
| ber for an equally fraudulent purpose.
RIVAL PLANT TO MAKE ACID.
New Enterprise Outcome of Battle BÂ©
.. tween Trust and Peyton Company.
A new phase In the alleged effort of
the powder trust to ruin the business
of the Peyton Chemical Company is set
forth In an answer filed by the latter
yesterday to the suit of Frank Turner
for a writ of mandate to permit him
to inspeot the books and records of the
chemical ooncern. Turner became the
owner of four shares of the Peyton
stock at the time the DuPont shares
in the company were sold for assess
ment. The Peytona declare that he is
not the real owner of the shares, but
that they still belong to the trust. Fur
thermore It Is declared that Turner la
an accountant in the employ of the Cal
ifornia Powder Company, which is in
the control of the DuPonts.
The Peytons say that they are In
formed and believe that the California
Powder Company is preparing to ex
pend $500,000 for the purpose pf estab
lishing an acid business as a rival of
the Peyton company, and that this is a
part of the scheme of the truat to wreck
the local corporation. The purpose of

books, it is charged, is to acquire in

KESOLUTION ADOPTED
California Congressional
Delegation Is Requested

The California Btate Board of Trade
adopted resolutions yesterday opposing
the conferring of power on the Inter

ulate rates of transportation on inter
state commerce, and declared itself to
be in "unqualified opposition." For rea
sons the board set forth the following;
The conferring of suoh power would. In the
opinion of this body, i convert the Interstate
Commerce Commission ". Into â¢ a board of^trafflo
managers for all thÂ« - railroads i carrying I Inter

â It .would Test the Interstate Oommeroe Com

stituting that commission a potent factor -In

would corner . upon the ' railroads the ' moral
right to entar the arena ?of politics in their
corporate capacity as a measure ; of : defense
against the possible arbitrary and ooo&scatorr
exercise of this power. .
It would engender at â  ones seotlooal strife
between - the different portions â¢ of the coon
try as to the measure of protection which this
power of regulation might be Invoked .to con
fer ; upon the various sections â a . contest In
which the newer and < more . sparsely settled
regions of the United States would suffer by
reason of the overmastering; ' political power

The export commerce. In the green citrus
and deciduous fruits, th* '-, dried and cured
fruits, the veretables, , the win* and the lum
ber products of California, must be carried an
average distance of over two thousand - live
hundred miles to reach their center of , distri
bution In the United States. These products
compete with like Eastern products which are
carried an average distance nt less than -.two
hundred and fifty miles. Owing to the dispar
ity In volume between the east bound and west
bound trafflo ' the railroads have heretofore
carried the products of California the distance
noted ami delivered them in BJastern markets
at a rate that has enabled them to success*
fully compete with like products in the frelrbt

That this fostering polfoy, rsferraWe to the

not even probable. In view of these objections,
be it
Resolved by this board. That the Senators

State of California be requested , to exercise

HONITON EASILY TAKES
THE HANDICAP AT OAKLAND
FIVE PUBLIC CHOICES GO BY THE BOARD
Sunny Shore Comes
From the Rear
and Wins.
Wheln the bookmakers chalked up
4 to 6 about Honiton ln the betting on
the Futurity course handicap at Oak
land yesterday the figures read like a
comic valentine. Even though asked to
carry 124 pounds, "Packey" Ryan's
crack mare had nothing to beat.
To be sure, Misty's Pride is a clever
piet c of racing material, but she had a
hard race ihe preceding: day. Lindsay
â¢ Gordon is a Derby prospect and was
100 to 1. Rector is only a fair plater,
Sea Voyage might have had a
chance with a ninety horse-power
Mercedes machine behind to push her
along. Minder didn't get Honiton
away weii from the -barrier, bo took
matters quietly to the stretch. Then he
made hie move and at the end the fa
vorite breezed in before Rector and Sea
Voyage in 1:0%, within half a second,
Of the track record.
PROFITABLE DAY FOR BOOKIES.
To the handicap winner belongs the
honor of saving the ravorites from a
r^neral massacre, as five other choices
veie lurked snugly away In their lit
tle trundle beds. The ring must have
had a profitable day.
There were fourteen starters in the
maiden 2-year-old scramble, and the
v-inner turned up ln Bellona, a daugh
ter of Beau Ormonde. The filly was 7
' to 1 In the ring and, ridden by
Travers, lasted long enough to beat the
favorite, George A. Knight, a head.
< harley Patterson's lsabeau finished
third.
Bob Ragcn. the 7-to-10 favorite for
the eix-and-a-half-furlong run far
3-year-olds, was so stiff and sore that i
he should have been in a sanitarium
instead of out racing. Possibly to this i
fact can be attributed the rush to get ''
aboard I>r. Rowell's Mistress of Rolls, i
played from 1L down to 6. Everything
f<~]\ into line but Saccharate, the Napa !
Stock Farm entry- Not conceded a i
rhance and drifting back to 11 to 1. i
'Big Bill" Knapp took the chestnut i
filly out In the lead and in a drive she '
downed Mistress of Rolls a length. The
lavorite ran third.
Bob Smith's Silent Water, an 11 to
6 choice for the five and a half fur
long dash, also decided under celling
conditions, finished second to Sir Pres
ton. The favorite raotfi Agnes Mack
;nto subjection and was in turn easily
'ed of by the second choice, also i
piloted by Knapp. The show fell to 1
Rf vr.it. Plckaway failed to display any |
speed.
JURE DUX3TS COLORS IN FRONT.
Dropping from the clouds, it almost
d. Jere Dunn's Bunny Shore took
the mile and a furlong Belling fixture,
o.uoted at 7 and 8 to 1 ln the ring. The
P.alma gelding is a very slow beginner
and during the earlier stages of the
running looked hopelessly out of it.
TV" right, who had the leg up, stuck to
the rail though and turning into the
stretch had a good position. From
there home there was nothing to it,
the Dunn entry wading past the leaders
and scoring almost easily from the
favorite. Cinnabar. Theodore L. was
third.
Another fancy priced one came down
the line first ln the concluding mile and
fifty yard number. Rather accorded
the overlook at 10 and 12, Louis Ezell's
Traps^tter finished nearly a length in
advance of the favorite. Best Man, at
the wire. After cutting out the pace
Haven Run weakened, running a mod
erate third.
TRACK NOTES.
Knapp piloted two winners.
Bellona Is trained by the veteran
Bea Tiramons, one of the best hand-
Bf two-year-olds in the country.
Alec Forbes sold Miller's Daughter
after claiming the filly from
â ay> race for $1000. Zlck
Al.raniÃ is the reputed purchaser.
Well, one point in question has
finally been settled â Sir Preston is a
much better horse on a dry track
than he is on a heavy one.
Colonel Jack Price, a member of the
board of stewards controlling the
Canadian circuit, waa a visitor yes

ACCIDENTALLY SHOT. â Raymond Shea, a,
fourteen-year-old boy. died yesterday In the
French Hospital from the effects of a gunshot
â¢round received accidentally last Saturday on
McNear's ranch near Port Costa. Shea and
another boy named Joseph McGulre were in

CARDINAL NINE
IS VICTORIOUS
Takes Its First Game of
the Season by Defeating
Clabrough - Golcher Team
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 14.
â Stanford won her first baseball vic
tory of the season to-day in the first
game of the series with the Clabrough-
Golcher team of San Francises. The
score wag 6 to 6.
Throughout the first six innings the
cardinal team played a ragged game,
the poor fielding and batting being in
excusable at this time of the season.
The Clabrough-Golcher team secured
its first run in the second Inning,
the score being directly attributable to
the errors of the home team. In the
fourth Stanford succeeded ln bunch
ing enough errors to permit four more
men to cross the plate.
On three bases on balls of Hughes
In the fifth inning, together with an
error, Stanford scored two runs. The
score was tied ln the eighth through
a single by Stott, a two-bagger by Col
bert, and a home-run by Fenton. All
three runs were secured off Parker.
The concluding score was made in
the ninth inning on a forced run, giv
ing Stanford her first victory out of
the five games played this season. The
pitching of Thiele, a hitherto untried
freshman, who succeeded Sales in the
fifth inning, was one of the features
of the game from a Stanford stand
point.

The society ladies who are Interest

at Ingleside racecourse on Washing
ton's birthday are working actively for
its success. Mrs. Henry T. Scott, Mrs.

There are a number of ponies in
training at Ingleside at present, and
there will be several additions during
the next few days. The extensive
string of Rudolph Spreckels is at the
track, and the various ponies are work

stable, negotiated a quarter of a mile
cleverly yesterday in 23 3-5 seconds.
Midlove, the diminutive daughter of
Midlothian, is at the track as sound as
a dollar. She worked a fast quarter.
She showed some temper, which In

handling at the barrier.
Charles W. Clark's ponies are ex

COFFEY AND HIS WIFE
TELiIj DIFFERENT STORIES
She Testifies to His Cruelty, and He
Declares She Is Extravagant and
Profane.
Regardless of the traditions of St.
Valentine's day as to the supposed
happiness of mates, Freda Coffey and
her husband, Edward Coffey, the lat
ter a well-to-do building contractor,
tcld yesterday in Judge Troutt's court
many unlovely incidents of their mar
ried life.
The wife seeks a divorce on the
ground of cruelty. She said that her
si ouse has a "very, very, very vile
temper," that he called her unmen
tionable words, which she mentioned
glibly, and that on one occasion he
grabbed his 4-year-old son (by a for
mer marriage) by the heels and
threatened to dash out his brains.
When this was prevented by Mrs. Cof
fey and her mother, Mrs. Olson, Coffey
said he would cut the boy's throat.
Mrs. Olson, a member of the Salva
tion Army, corroborated her daugh
ter's evidence.
When Coffey took the stand, he told
another story of their home life. He
s&ld his wife was extravagant, staid
away from home, would not cook his
meals and swore at him. Evidence as
to his own "Christian spirit" and de
votion to hard work and of his do
mesticity was given by several of his
friends. The trial has not been fin
ished.
Divorce was granted yesterday by
Judge Sloss to Anna Hennessy from
William Hennessy for neglect, and by
Judge Murasky to Maggie Gunther
from William C. Gunther for deser
tion.
Suit for divorce was begun by
Charles O. Perdue against Clarisa M.
Perdue, desertion; Lulu Campbell
against Charles Campbell, desertion;
William S. Wallace against Carolina
P. Wallace, desertion.
OBJECTS TO MURDERER
BEING OUT ON BONDS
District Attorney Bylngton Wants
Aged Joseph Smith Remanded
Into Custody of the Sheriff.
Joseph Smith, an aged contractor,
appeared in Judge Lawlor's court yes
terday and pleaded not guilty to the
charge of murder against him. The
case was continued till Saturday to
be set for trial. Smith shot and killed
Joseph E. McGowan on the morning
of November 26 in a brickyard on
Mission street belonging to McGowan's
father.
District Attorney Byington asked
the Judge to make an order remand
ing the defendant Into the custody of
the Sheriff, and that he not be al
lcwed his liberty on bonds. The de
fendant's attorney, Frank J. Murphy,
objected to such an order being made
and at his request action was deferred
till Saturday.
After Smith was held to answer
without bonds by Police Judge Mogan
aii application for a writ of habeas
corpus for his release was made be
fore Judge Cook. The application
was denied, but the Judge ordered
Smith released on $20,000 bonds
pending his trial.
SUPREME COURT HEARS
STORIES OF TROUBLES
Litigants Who Are Dissatisfied With
Decisions of Superior Judges
Present Their Appeals.
The Supreme Court yesterday set the
case of Kennedy vs. Lee for hearing
on March 6. It is thought that Gov
ernor Pardee -will have appointed the
Judges of the District Courts of Ap
peal by that time so the eighth Jus
tice needed to decide the case men
tioned may be secured.
Arguments were heard yesterday
before the court in bank in the cose
of Solomon Kusel, who has appealed
from a judgment of divorce against
him. The plaintiff is a septuagenar
ian, who has found married life a
hopeless failure. His wife has sued
him five different times and his mod
est fortune has gone in paying attor
neys' fees. He also wants his wife en
joined from bringing any more divorce
suits. The matter was submitted on
briefs.
The court refused to release F. A.
Robinson, who petitioned for a writ
of habeas corpus on the ground that
he had been illegally indicted by the
Grand Jury of Merced County.
MARVIN HART AND JACK JOHNSON
MAY DON THE GLOVES HERE
NEGOTIATIONS PENDING
FOR HEAVYWEIGHT BOUT
After canvassing the entire pugilU
tlc field of the country. Matchmaker
Alex Greggains is back to the Marvin
Hart-Jack Johnson fight again. These
two heavyweights seem to promise a
lively encounter and as the ring goers
have had a surfeit of the midget box
ers recently this seem* a pleasing
change. t
Hart was prepared to leave for Hot
Springs last night, but Manager Oreg
gains prevailed on him to remain
over. It is expected the boxers and
the club officials will have a confer
ence to-day when some definite action
will be taken. Hart has the reputa
tion of being an aggressive fighter and
as Johnson is noted for his cleverness
the bout should be an Interesting one.
One thing ln favor of the match is
that the men are on the ground and
are anxious to fight.
A permit has not been granted as
yet for March, but the only applica
tion presented to the Supervisors is
that of the San Francisco Athletic
Club.
The idea of matching Britt for next
month seems to have been abandoned.
He wants 70 per cent of the gross re
ceipts. The promoters seem inclined
to give only 50 per cent for their
fights this year, so it is difficult to
talk business with Britt.
Sam Berger completed the hardest
portion of his training yesterday, and

CHINESE WITNESSES CONTEST

half of the four Chinamen who were
subpenaed but failed to appear to
testify before the Police Commission
ers at the hearing of the charges
against Police Sergeant Thomas P.
Ellis, yesterday applied to the Super
ior Court for a writ of certlorari. and
a hearing will be had before Judge
Sloss this afternoon. The court is
asked to declare that the Police Com

diction.
The petitioners are Mar Lin Kit.
Chin Kirn You, Chin Bock Guy and
Quan Bun. The subpenas were Is
sued on February 7 for them to ap
pear before the commission on the
evening of that day. They did not
appear, and on Monday, by resolution,
the commissioners ordered the Issu
ance of writs of attachment for the
arrest of the delinquents, returnable
to-day, when the Chinamen would be
expected to show why they should not
be punished for contempt.
The validity of this action is ques
tioned upon the ground that the
police board has no Jurisdiction to is
sue attachments for the arrest of any
person for contempt; that there is no
authority in law for such proceeding,
and on the further ground that there
was no service of the subpenas. It 13
also contended that the absence of an
affidavit for the issuance of the writs
is a jurisdictional defect.
DE HAVEN DOES NOT LIKE
LAWYERS TO WRANGLE
Threatens to Make an Example of
Belligerent Counsel for Lack of
Respect ln Court.
During the trial of Jan Kan in
United States District Judge de Ha
ven's court yesterday afternoon As
sistant United States Attorney Ben L.
McKinley and Thomas C. West, the
latter attorney for the defendant, got
into a wrangle concerning the com
petency of certain questions pro
pounded to a witness. Judge de Ha
ven sharply rapped upon the table
with his gavel and spoke his mind.
He said that the counsel had been
"snapping and snarling"; such con
duct might be tolerated in a polite
court, he added, "but it cannot be
permitted here. If I have occasion
to call the matter to the attention of
counsel again I shall do it in such a
way that the counsel will know it. I
want this case conducted in such a
manner that an American citizen need
not hang his head in shame."
After this chastisement the lawyers
were as meek as lambkins and the
amenities of genteel conduct were ob
served during the remainder of the
day.
The theory of the defense is that
Jan Kan was deceived as to th* iden
tity of Tong Qual Ho, the young Chi
nese girl who waa brought to this
country under the name of Li Ml Ho.
The trial will be resumed this morn
ing.

Pharmacy Obtains Warrant for
John English's Arrest.

structed to write to English to see
what he would do.

ter and a reply was received on Feb

that the certificate be forwarded as
s-oon as possible. The board instruct
ed Crowley to take criminal proceed
ings against English and the warrant
issued yesterday Is the result.

SECOND TRIAL OF GUNTHI-IR
I,F.ADS TC3 COMPLICATIONS
Judge Lawlor Wants to Transfer Case
to Judge Dunne's Court, but At
torney Shortridge Objects.
The case of E. W. Gunther, charged
with offering and giving a bribe, was
on Judge Lawlor's calendar for trial
yesterday. At the former trial before
Judge Wells of Contra Costa County
the jury disagreed. It was stated in
court yesterday that Judge Wells
could not retry the case till next
month and Judge Lawlor said he
would transfer it for trial to Judge
Dunne's court.
Attorney Shortridge, for the de
fendant, objected to the case being
transferred to Judge Dunne's court,
but Judge Lawlor pointed out that as
Judge Cook was a witness in the case
and his jown calendar was crowded,
there was only Judge Dunne left.
Judge Dunne had been spoken to and
had agreed to the transfer. At At
torney Shortridge"s request the order
transferring the case was delayed till
to-morrow.
Gunther is accused of giving David
J. Kelly, a juror a^ the trial of a
Chinese for murder, a bribe of $200
which he put in Kelly's coat pocket on
May 24 last.

CHAMBER ACTS
ON PILOT BILL
Favors National Control of
Service Under Steamboat
Inspection Bureau Eule
TRUSTEES UNANIMOUS
Eeport of the Committee
on Harbor and Shipping
Is Beceived and Adopted
The trustees of the Chamber of Com- I
merce decided yesterday that they
would not favor the opposition that the
San Francisco pilots are making to the
bill in Congress transferring the control
of the pilotage service from the State
to the United States Inspection Bureau.
So far as the chamber is concerned, ac
cording to the action taken yesterday
by the trustees, the bill to give over the
control to the Federal Government is
approved.
Some time ago a representative of the
pilots visited the trustees of the cham
ber and presented the views of his as
sociates at some length. The matter
was considered to be of such import
ance that the trustees referred It to the
chamber's committee on harbor and
shipping. This committee, of which
Captain W. H. Marston is the chair
man, reported yesterday, and the trus
tees, after discussion, unanimously
adopted the report.
The Chamber of Commerce has been
notified by the Panama Canal Commis
sion that no bids will be advertised for
supplies to be used in the construction
of the canal, but that proposals will
be sent to the Chamber of Commerce
in this city and to kindred organiza
tions elsewhere. Here the Chamber of
Commerce will undertake the task of
informing the public of the proposals,
notifying the parties interested in the
particular lines of supplies that are
needed. Copies of all proposals are
kept on hand at the offices of the j
Chamber of Commerce, In the Mer
chants' Exchange building.
Charged With Malicious Mischief.
William Glynn, who has a cigar
store at 643 Market street, obtained a
warrant from Police Judge Cabaniss
yesterday for the arrest of James J.
O'Brien, foreman for a contractor who
is razing the building at that number
on a charge of malicious mischief.
Glynn says he has a month to month
lease of his store and it was only on
Monday that he was told to quit and
the contractor's men at once began
to pull down the grillwork around his
store. He demanded thirty days' no
tice, but his demand was ignored.
Civil Service Examinations.
The Municipal Service Commission
will hold an examination for disinter
ment inspector, Department of
i Health, on Monday, March 20, at the
â  City Hall. Applications must be filed
1 before March 4 next. An examina
â¢ tion for side sewer men, Department
! of Works, will be held at the City
j Hall on Wednesdey, March 8, and ap
| plications therefor will not be received
j after March 3.

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, Feb. 14.
The police force of Berkeley was re
duced by the Town Trustees last night,
seven names being: ordered taken from
the roll of officers. No new men were
appointed to the vacancies created. The
force now consists of Marshal Kerns
and three deputies. One of these, Bert
Howard, Is also a license collector. He
quits work when the shadows fall, as
does Marshal Kerns. The remaining
two men serve occasionally at night-
Lack of funds is given as the reason
for the action taken by the Trustees.
The men were paid $70 a month.
Marshal Kerns suggested last night
that Special Officer* Johnson and Rosa,
who have been serving without pay, be
discharged, as they have not proved
satisfactory to him. The board adopted
the suggestion, but went further, and
without warning discharged all officers
"appointed during the last threÂ«
months."
The five extra men who are thus let
out were appointed two months ago,
following an epidemic of hold-ups, as
saults and burglaries. The Marshal
had asked that the appointments be
permanent, but his request was not
granted.
The five men who are removed from
the force are S. L. Coey, Burton Camp
bell, J. F. Farrar, Walter Brothers and
Alonzo Johnson.

yards of sand were opened in the office
of Colonel W. H. Heuer in San Fran

that the Golden Gate Dredging and
Reclamation Company and the North
American Dredging Company presented
the , lowest estimates and both would
put machines to work at once.
The city of Stockton hag b^Â»n making
an effort to keep the mam channel
open, but the sand aettlÂ«Â»-l â  > such an
extent that one dredger could not keep
a passageway for steamboats open.
To-day it was impossible for the rtver
steamers to cross, and to-night thÂ»
freight placed on barges cannot b*
towed over the sandbar, as the cable
of the dredger working on the shoal
parted and allowed the bucket to drop
In the deepest water, and until it Is re
covered the boats cannot get away.

GENERAL 6UI2MABY.
Tb.Â» Â«rÂ«ather was generally dear and much
cooler than during the preceding week, with
light to brisk aunherly winds. X*lgbt rain fell
la portion* of toe "?nhera seotions on the 10th,

cept In low places; thin Ice and heaviest frost
for two years in surrounding country, damag
ing vegetables and citrus fruit tree rhcots ex
cept where protected."
The clear weather and drying winds quickly
absorbed the surplus moisture in the soil, en
â¢.bllnc lannert to returns plowing and seeding.
The aerear* In grain will probably be the larg
est for sever*; years In all parts of tbe State,
and the outlook is rood for record-breaking
crops of wheat, oats and barley. Grain con
tinues in rood condition and is making fair
growth. There will be a large acreage cf al
falfa. Pasturage is abundant In all sections
and cattle are In prime condition.
Almond trees are In bloom in many section*
and early deciduous fruits are budding. The
cold weather is regarded as very favorable for
the fruit and grape interests. Orange picking
has been resumed in Southern California, but
shipments continue light. Pruning and culti
vating are progressing in orchards and vine
yards.

wan retarded by the cold. The acreage In
frralr. is bÂ«lng Increased and prospects are
corvl for large crops. .Pasturage Is abundant

in orchards and vineyards. The southern dis
tricts have received more than the usual
amount of rainfall, and prospects for large

prime offerings are meeting with a' fair de

movement In cheap etock. which is In bur
densome supply. All kinds of seed Potatoes
are In good request and steady. Onions are
dear owing to the high cost at northern ship
ping points. Two cars of Sweets were mar
keted yesterday and. as the stock was of good
quality, prices had a narrower range.
The receipts of southern vegetables were
very light, as usual on Tuesday, and held-over
stock was quoted at previous prices. Aspara

Butter. Cheese and EgÂ£9.
Receipts of Butter were much larger yes
terday, as will be seen, and the market weak
ened off again, with eellers offering- fresly
and buyers scarce and cautious. Cheese on
the contrary, was very steady, with stocks
materially reduced.

than buyers. Receipts continued liberal, as
will be seen, and stocks are steadily accumu

Amend T'niversity Law as
to Retiring Professors
WOULD USE DISCBETION
Board Dispatches Routine
Business for Month With
Barely a Quorum Present
Garret W. McEnerney, Regent of the
University of California, does riot be
lieve that a professor has necessarily
outlived his usefulness at 70 years of
age, or that the State, on the other
. hand, should be bound to retire any 1
member of the faculty on pension with
1 out some power of discretion.
At the meeting of the board yesterday
1 Begem McEnerney gave notice that at
â¢ th? next session he would move to
amend section 174 of the laws of the
j university by changing the mandatory
"shall" to "may." He would have the
â¢section read as follows:
"A professor who after twenty years
of service in the university shall have
attained the age of 70 years shall be '
. appointed professor emeritus, with pay
at the rate of two-thirds of the salary
paid him during the year next preced
. Ing such appointment."
Professors George llowison and E.
TV. Hilgard are 70 years of age, and
their desire to continue., active work
â  â would be gratified by the passage 'of
' the amendment.

WITNESS RIDES
IS AUTOMOBILE
Aged Patrick Hannon Comes
From San Jose in Auto
to Give His Testimony
STATEMENTS CONFLICT
John H. Yoell Denies That
His Father Paid $1300
Note Held by the Old Man
Aged Patrick Hannon, an important
witness for the proponents in the Toell
j case, had his first automobile ride yes
1 terday. It was a Jong one, from San
Jose to Judge Kerrigan's court. There
the old resident of San Jose gave signs
of a memory weak on some points and
strong on others. He declared positive
ly that J. Alexander Yoell had paid a
note of John H. Yoell for $1300. This
was firmly denied by the son.
Checks for larger amounts from John
H. Yoell to Hannon were produced by
Attorney Hoefler, but the old man
emild not recall what they were for,
though he admitted having received
them. *
"Is your memory pretty good?" asked
the attorney.
" 'Tis not as good as when I was
ycung. like you," replied the old man
in a rich brogue.
"How did you get here," asked Attor
ney Hoefler suddenly.
"In an automobile." replied the old j
fellow. "I understood that I would be j
subpenaed, so I came."
One reply of Hannon's caused some
merriment.
You say that you only got 50 cents
on the dollar on the $750 note," said
Hoefler.
"Yes. replied the old man without a
smile. "The lawyers got the other half."
Hannon, who had had business trans
actions with J. Alexander Yoell since
save his opinion that the Santa
Clara pioneer was of sound mind when
he knew him. "Because," added Han
non. "he could not have made so much
money if he wasn't."
John H. Yoell told how the first dif
ference between his father and mother
was settled. "My father came to me
and begged me to use my influence to |
make my mother take him back. He ;
offered to settle all my debts if I would.
I told him that I would do nothing un
less he settled with cash on the spot."
Yoell explained some of the checks j
given to the mother by showing how !
his father evaded payment of taxes. |
'At a certain time of the year my
father would check over all he had in â 
the bank to my mother to evade taxa- '
tion." he explained. "This custom ex- j
tended over many years."
The case will be resumed at 10:30 j
o'clock to-day.

NOT A REGULAR SOLDIER
BUT ONLY A VOLUNTEER
Nicholson Dubbed Deserter
Dismissal of His Grace, Schwartz, Very
Likely to Be Ordered.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
For disturbing a free-for-all inter
change of spiritual experiences by
Volunteers of America last Sunday
afternoon In the barracks at 317
Grant avenue, Joseph D. Nicholson
was sentenced to twenty-four hours'
imprisonment and reminded that he
ought to be heartily ashamed of his
conduct. Inasmuch as he had recently
enlisted in the corps and therefore
appeared in the light of a deserter.
Police Judge Mogan pronounced both
the sentence and the reminder.
Mr. Nicholson expressed sorrow
that the stigma of desertion attached
to him, and hoped he would be re
lieved of It by those who understood
the circumstances of his enrollment
as a Volunteer. Alcoholic indulgence
had impaired his reasoning faculties,
he averred, else he could not have
been induced to serve In an army for
i whose methods he had no warm sym
| pathy during his intervals of mental
l lucidness. Indeed so disordered was
! his mind at the time of his enlistment
; and until the time of his arrest that
, he felt justified in pleading temporary
insanity and demanding a retraction
, of the charge that he was a willful
! deserter. The penalty of his peace
disturbance he would accept without
demur, because h* felt that the brief
incarceration it invdlVfed would con
| tribute to the clarification of his
i senses. That was all.
Major Markham said that he was
j addressing his comrades when Mr.
XicholÃon provoked arrest by unseem
! ]y interruptions of the discourse. For
'. Instance, when the Major said, "My
I friends, I'm so glad to be able to tell
Mr. Nicholson frantically
I shouted, "Hooray, hooray, hooray,
i t-i-g-e-r!" thus derailing the Major's
I train of thought and distracting the
\ attention of the auditory from his
argument. These irrelevant and irre
verent ejaculations by Mr. Nicholson
were borne until the assemblage
unanimously demanded his expulsion.
Arrest followed.
Private Stedman corroborated Ma
jor Markham's testimony and adduced
other facts and some surmises. Mr.
Nicholson joined the Volunteers on
Saturday afternoon, on Saturday night
a clock disappeared from the barracks
and on Sunday afternoon the new re
cruit openly backslided. No, the
clock was not found in Mr. Nicholson's
possession.
It looks like dismissal for Mrs.
Grace Schwartz, charged with having
operated a poolroom annex to her
husband's stationery business on Polk
street. Her conviction is dependent
upon the testimony of a woman em
ployed by the police to buy a pool
on a certain TiorSe in a certain race at
Emeryville, but the feminine sleuth
must be an amateur, for she refuses
to appear in court and repeat the
story of the betting transaction which
she told to Patrolman Kracke. A
number of women who were arrested
1 with Mrs. Schwartz and booked for
visiting a poolroom have been fined
$10 apiece by Judge Mogan.
â¢ * â¢
Alfred Hudson, chief boatswain's
mate of the battleship Ohio, came
ashore and ran afoul of two firemen
] from the s:Â»me fighting machine,, and
! when he was arrested for peace dis
| turbance one of his eyes was bruised
I and discolored. Judge Mogan dis
: charged him from custody and ex
; presFPd regret that -the stokers had not
I also been arrested so that they could
j be punished by civil law for abusing
j him, but Mr. Hudson said he could
i not share His Honor's regret, as he
(Mr. H.) preferred to have his assail
ants punished aboard ship, where he
will be in a position to see to it that
: they get all that is coming to them.
"And they won't do a thing to
i them," remarked Bailiff Hickey, who
j is looked upon as an oracle in matters
pertaining to nautical life.
â¢ â¦ â¢
Mrs. Mary Frisco, who was caught in
the act of stealing 15 cents from a
Spanish churoh on Broadway, was the
recipient of much police sympathy prior
to her arraignment before Judge Ca
baniss, for she told a piteous tale of
having been driven by the cries of her
two hungry and helpless babes to com-,
mit the robbery. When she departed
from court, however, with a five
months' term of imprisonment in front
of her no condolence was heard, be
cause it had been proven that she had
made a practice of pilfering alms from
the churcjt in which she was arrested
and that she carried a key to assist her
in the burglaries. Her unfortunate lit
tle ones will be cared for in a public
institution.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Mrs. Jeanette Clark, a colored wom
an, who fractured a white man's skull
by smiting it with a baseball bat <svhile
she was under accusation of peace dis
turbance, could not pay a fine of $150
and started to Berve an alternative sen
tence of seventy-five days, pronounced
by Judge Fritz. The peace disturbance
case is in Jusiffe Mogan's court, and
plip will appear there for sentence next
Friday.
The woman lived on Beach street,
near the Presidio, and abused some
Caucasian neighbors, who apparently
objected to her residence in the vicin
ity. After she was found guilty as
charged she went home and battered
the head of Harry Clarke, one of her
accusers, so badly that the cranium
was cracked and he was stone deaf
for several days.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It developed that Miss Trixie Bell,
balladist, and Miss Eva Dimples, de
scriptive vocalist, were the envious
vaudevfllians who assailed Miss Alice
Wainwj-ight, clog and soft-shoe dancer,
last Friday night at Jackson and
Kearny streets while the latter lady
was celebrating her triumphant debut
at the Star music hall by touring the
Barbary Coast In an automobile with
C. F. Truesdell. a bartender. Miss
Walnwright and her escort were arrest
ed for fighting, while the Misses Bell
and Dimples eluded Patrolman Nelson,
but were traced, captured, charged
before Judge Cabaniss with peace dis
turbance and had their trial set for j
next Friday. The other defendants !
were dismissed by Judge Mogan after j
they had explained that they were
more sinned against than sinning, as
the fight was started by the Misses [
Bell and Dimples, who were furiously |
jealous of the terrific hit made by Miss :
Wainwright, even after one of her clogs j
had been maliciously purloined and she j
was consequently compelled to confine \
her "turn" to a soft-shoe jig, billed as I
"footsteps in the sand."
â¢ â¢ â¢
Thomas Doyle, charged with having
stolen $100 from an intoxicated man in
a Third street saloon, was sent to the
Superior Court by Judge Conlan, with
bail set at $3000.
John English, accused of fracturing
the ordinance which prohibits the
making of music, either genuine or
questionable, between the hours of 1
and 6 a. m., in any saloon, pleaded that
it was the grand opening of his wet
goods establishment at Fulton street
and Seventh avenue, and he did not in
tend willful defiance of the law by
permitting a piano to be thumped
while two ladies danced a nimble
measure after 1 o'clock yesterday
morning on his premises. Irldeed, he
would go so far as to deny the accu
sation that the piano was willfully
played, for the jangles heard by the
policemen were caused by one of the
masculine celebrants of the grand
opening accidentally Ftumbling back
ward and alighting with his elbows
upon the keyboard, one arm striking
a bass octave and the other smiting
I the ivories which produce the chills-
and-fever and sparkling-water notes, j
As for the dancing of the ladies, it '
was neither ungraceful nor creative j
of noise. Besides, he doubted that the )
time w more than a very few mm- I
utes past 1 o'clock when the police- j
men butted in and summarily brought^
the grand opening to a sudden cessa-*
tion by arresting him.
In reply to all of which the two po
licemen positively averred that the
piano was kept in active service long
after 1 o'clock, and that the plea of the
sounds being made by human elbows
colliding with the keys was nigh to
bosh, because they, although not set
ting themselves up as music sharps,
were certain that a coherent tune was
being played. Appreciative of the fact
that a grand opening was in progress,
they were reluctant to stop the rev
elry, but duty was duty and their ser
geant was vigilant. No, they would
not attempt criticism of the dancing of
the ladies. It was not the dancing that
provoked their interference with the
festivities, but the piano-playing.
Judge Mogan also made allowance
for the fact of the alleged law frac
ture being committed at a grand open
ing, and dismissed the case with a
hint to Mr. English that a grand open
ing of any saloon cannot occur more
than once and that his reappearance
on a similar charge would surely re
sult to his disadvantage if he should
ever apply for a renewal of his license.
In remanding Robert Coronel for
trial in the Superior Coyrt, with bail
fixed at $10,000, Judge Mogan expressed
a hope that the defendant would be
sentenced to the maximum penalty
for robbery with violence.
"And I'm sorry," his Honor added,
"that capital punishment cannot be
ordered for offenders such as you. If
you are sent to the penitentiary for
life I shall rejoice."
After drinking with Percy Towne, a
restaurant cook, in several Barbary
Coast saloons, Coronel struck him on
the Jaw with some hard Instrument â
probably brass knuckles â knocking
him senseless, and then robbed him of
a watch and chain and two purses con
taining about $10. Towne's jaw was
broken by the blow, and will be per
manently disabled. Coroncl was found
in bed by Patrolman Nick Bakulich.
and under the mattress of his couch
the plunder was concealed.
For passing a fictitious $50 check on
Thomas Ferguson, a saloon-keeper
"Walter M. Collins, alias Cummins,
must answer in the Superior Court.
Judge Conlan fixed his bail at $2000.

GRANEY ATTACKS
EDITOR GARRETT
Blacksmith and Referee on
Warpath Because of an
Editorial in the Post
USES FIST AND FOOT
Crowds of Women on Way to
the Opera Are Horrified
by the Savage Spectacle
Eddie Graney's strong left arm,
grown powerful in many a struggle
with fractious hoofs, expended its force
i and gave vent to bitter animosity on
â  the head of Editor Thomas Garrett of
; the Evening Post last night. Officially,
for Graney.is the well-kno\Tn referee
as well as horseshoer, it was a left
hook to the nose that let the blood
and revenged a scathing editorial in
which the "little blacksmith" was last
evening depicted in various degrees of
moral vn worth and incompetency and
too dishonest to drive the nails straight
in shoeing the horses for the munici
pality's tire department.
The battle took place in the street in
front of the Tivoli Theater, to which
the editor was wending his way to hear
soul-stirring: opera. Graney, unwearied
with the day's toil at the bellows, was
on an excited hunt for Garrett, and the
winds had carried far and wide the
meaning of his curling lip.
"There's your man," pointed a man
from behind a cigar store crowd that
had been regaled during the afternoon
and evening with blasts from the hoof
sizzling shop in denunciation of Super
visors for opposing the shoeing con
tract and later of the editor who ran
corously commended their course and
scored the personal character of the
"municipal blacksmith."
In a moment there was a demand
for a retraction. Garrett reufsed. Out
shot the southpaw. Down went the
editor on the hard pavement. But the
spirit of self-defense was lacking.
Graney measured out the number of
kicks that ugly mules had landed on
him in his career in the shop.
Bleeding and overwhelmed, weeping
as well some of the bystanders say, the
editor was finally allowed to arise, and
he appealed to Detective Taylor, who
was standing by.
"I saw nothing." said the sleuth, and
he could therefore not make an arrest.
The.c was much excitement, for the
street was thronged with the rush of
people to hear Tetrazzini. The hun
dreds of women were horrified at the
spectacle.
Later the editor sought out his assail
ant in a nearby saloon to talk the mat
ter over. He had not written the
editorial, he explained, and he dis
played a pistol that he said his self
control had happily kept in a state of
inaction. With a handkerchief in his
coat pocket the doughty blacksmith
made a bluff that he too was heeled.
The wind-up of the fracas was a gen
eral apology and gin fizz for mutual
good-will.
SEEKS DEATH UNDER
STREET CAR YVHEEIiS
Man Whose Name Is Thought to Be
Sclimidt Commits Suicide in
Tragic Manner.
With evident purpose of ending his
life, a man named Schmidt threw
himself in front of car 1315 of the
Ellis-street line at Bluxome and
Fourth streets yesterday morning,
and he afterward died on the operat
ing table in the Central Emergency
Hospital.
Motorman J. M. Cummings said the
man deliberately jumped in front of
the car, allowing no opportunity to
prevent the fatality. The skull was
fractured. An examination of the
man's clothing and effects .showed
him to be in poor financial circum
stances. In his pockets was a laundry
check. No. 034231, issued by the Met
ropolitan laundry of 129 Third street,
with the name "Schmidt" written
thereon, but nothing further was
found by which his identity could be
ascertained.

California Commissioners
to St. Louis 3Jake Final
Eeport to the Governor
The California Commissioners to the
St. Louis Exposition filed their final re
port with Governor Pardee yesterday,
and this closed up their business and
the two commissioners and Secretary
Dennison ceased drawing pay from yes
terday on the "St. Louis account. The
commissioners reported that California
was well represented by its products
and won credit at St. Louis. The com
missioners were allowed $2500 each for
their personal expenses, but they ex
pended on this account less than $1000
each. The facts concerning the exhib
its and the exhibition space occupied in
each of the buildings at St. Louis were
reviewed in the report. Altogether Cal
ifornia's exhibits, including the outside
space covered, occupied 66,355 square
feet.
Concerning some matters of general
interest the commissioners reported as
follows:
At no previous exposition, so far aa our ob
servations extend, have all the important sec
tions of California been more completely ex
ploited in proportion to their merits than they
werÂ« at St. Louis. Indeed, It is notorious that
for the first time the great Saoramento Valley,
the rich counties bordering; the San FVanclsco
Bay, the fertile region of the central ccast and
tha fruitful and expansive San Joaquln Valley.
as well as the portion of the Stat* south of
Tehachapi ivero exploited more nearly in pro
portion to their actual merits, each section
without prejudice to the other, than they ever
were at any previous exposition made by this
State. A study of the distribution of thÂ« seven
hundred award* won by California will fhow
this to be the case.
The financial part of the report showa
that $5762 98 is returned to the State
treasury of the $130,000 appropriation
made by the Legislature for exhibition
purposes: that the exhibit material on
hand available for Portland is worth
$12,000, and that there are freight re
bates due that amount to $430 85.
