SEOUL, Jan. 21.â The Emperor of
Korea has ordered 700 revolvers and
clubs distributed to the peddlers, who
are nominally secret police and who
are a dangerous element. Many Ko

"The American position here is pecu
liar. The legation is surrounded by a
large force of Korean troops. There
are American women and children liv
ing in Seoul and there Is extensive
American electric railway and lighting
property here. An accidental killing
by electric cars is liable to cause riots,
such as previously occurred when a
mob led by Korean soldiers attacked

HISTORY OF NEGOTIATIONS.
With his flye-year-old .brother^ Eddie.
Elliott was hunting .squirrels.. He was
armed only with a 22-caliber rifle. -In
a .clumD of Jb>ushes the lads were at
tacked by a. wolf, unusually, large for
his species In this State. The younger
boy took refuge in 'flight, while Elliott
gave'battle-to the wolf. The animal,
evidently having been driven down
from the mountains by the recent
shows, was ferocious. \ The boy - fired
a shot from his toy rifle and ' before
the wolf reached ; him had discharged
the weapon twice more. All three bul
lets took effect, but not sufficiently to
disable the animal, which leaped at the
boy and fastened' his -fangs in the
youngster's leg.
Elliott, being unable to fire another
shot because : of the close quarters,
grappled .with the beast, seizing it -by
the throat. The animal snarled and
snapped viciously, but the lad held his
grip tightly; dropping his rifle and ap
plying air his strength with both hands
in an effort to shut off the wind of his
antagonist. This style of defense
proved <: effective. ; the wolf finally'los
ing strength and ceasing to struggle. r \
While the wolf lay gasping upon the
ground the lad dispatched It by cut
.tirig Its throat with a pocketknife.

flict with .'nothing more, serious "than a
flesh wound in the les to remind him
of it.

"In the meantime a large consign
ment of cartridges and gunpowder
reached Seoul yesterday consigned to
Yi Yung Ik. His followers are exceed
ingly numerous, including the ancient
guild of Po Sung, which Is relatively a
very strong organization. The Britten
legation increased its guard this morn-
Ing, sixteen more men having arrived."
"The Korean people and officials
largely blame Yi Yung Ik for the con
stantly increasing troubles and great
distress throughout the country. Yl
Yung Ik Is the most powerful favorite
ever protected by an Eastern monarch,
and he largely controls the Emperor's
personal treasury and the Government's
official funds. Yi Yung Ik is a Russian
protege, and his remarkable influence
with the Emperor has alone prevented
the opening of Wiju and other much
needed reforms. Many petitions are be
ing made to the Emperor for the favor
ite's execution or banishment, includ
ing one yesterday from the Prime Min
ister, and a powerful secret society al
ready formed and possessing more than
3000 members has sworn to kill YI Yung
Ik and two other favorite officials.
coterie of temporarily influential
courtiers is opposed to them because of
personal reasons. The circumstances
therefore -indicated the advisability of
providing an ample guard. ; The Ameri
cans are now fully protected and I con
sider conditions safe. The American
guard is orderly and well liked, sensa
tional reports to the contrary being en
tirely unwarranted.
"The prompt action of various na
tions in bringing guards here has done
much to insure the safety of foreigners,
but it is certain that danger still exists,
only needing some unfortunate incident
at this critical moment to start a riot,
which undoubtedly would be led by Ko
rean soldiers.

Count Cassini forwarded to the Era
bassadors and Ministers in Washing
ton the note of the Secretary of State.
This request from the White House
went to Count Cassini, Russian Em
bassador and dean of the diplomatic
corps. The secretaries and attaches
told one another. They were talking
about it all Wednesday afternoon, at
homes frequented by the diplomatic
corps and in the clubs.
For some reason, although most of
the members of the diplomatic corps
appear to excellent advantage in their
court' dress, they dislike to don gold
embellished garments, >and some, of
them have been Â¦Â¦: wearing citizens'
dress.
appcars^that. most" of * the"
diplomats jumped to the Wrong con
clusion. There will be no radical
change.- Count Cassini received yes
terday from Secretary Hay a brief,
note stating that it Was the desire of
the President that all members of the
diplomatic corps who attend the
evening reception of the season should
appear at the. White House in their
diplomatic uniforms. The request Is
taken by Count Cassini merely to re
fer to the reception .by the President
to the Judiciary to-morrow evening
and the Congressional and army re- 1
ceptions to follow in the order named.
The diplomatic reception last year
brought out all of the diplomats in
their official court dress. The recep
tion is given for them, and all who are
not absent from the city " or ill are
punctilious in their attendance. At
the receptions other than, the diplo
matic reception to which they were
bidden last year some of the diplo
mats wore their court uniform arid
others, did not. At this year's diplo
matic reception, which occurred on
January 7. several of the diplomats
were not in uniform. The result was
a trifle incongruous, and the request
from the State Department is the re
sult.

Special Dispatch to The Call
The news from Kentucky that Rep
resentative Hunter was conducting a
Hanna propaganda in the blue grass
region resulted in the departure | to
night of John W. Ycrkes, Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue and a mem
ber of 'the national committee, for
Louisville to undo Hunter's work. It
is claimed by the anti-Roosevelt fac
tion that should Hanna announce, his
candidacy he would get every delegate
from Kentucky. The Tennessee situa
tion also is to be grappled with at once.
The rampant Hanna sentiment in In
diana set several members of Congress
from that State to writing letters to
all of their constituents of prominence,
urging them to get the local forces into
line for the President. .
The news from New Tork, verifying
reports spread in Washington that
New York would not instruct for

Friends of the administration have
decided to begin an aggressive fight
for delegates to the national conven
tion. They believe they have waited
long enough, and they are going to
combat the effort which they are now
convinced will be made to prevent in
structions for the President, with a
view of defeating him in the conven
tion by a stampede to some other Re
publican. There is to be lively fighting
not only in Ohio, where Senator For
akcr is laying his plans for a campaign
for the President and against Senator
Hanna, but in New York, Indiana, Il
linois and Kentucky, where the no-in
struction idea seems to be rapidly
gaining ground.
Special Dirpatcli to Tbs Call
The closing arguments in the case
Tvere made last night. Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Ferral appearing for
the. prosecution. He was followed by
Hugh Mclsaacs and Frank Drury for
the defense. The concluding argu
ment for the prosecution was made by
District Attorney Byington. The jury
went out at 10 and returned with its
verdict in about an hour.
The trial began on January 11 and
strong circumstantial evidence was
introduced. It was shown that Bow
ers, uhen first taken ill, was removed
to a sanitarium, where he began rap
idly to recover. Later he was taken
to his home. and. despite the efforts of
the attending physicians, sank rap
idly. Later he was removed to an
other hospital, but died a few hours
after his arrival there. It was also
shown that about this time MrsI Bow
ers had drawn a considerable sum of
money from a local savings bank. The
money had been deposited in the joint
names of herself and husband, that
either might draw it. The theory of
Ihe prosecution was that Mrs. Bowers
wished to cot rid of her husband that
che might be free to consort with
others who seemed to have a stronger
hold upon her affections.
The formal charges were filed on
fc'eptembfi' 5 and on :>eptcnil>er 22 the
women wore given their preliminary
hearing before Judge Cabaniss. He
did not consider the evidence against
Mrs. Sutton strong enough to warrant
him in holding her and she was ac
cordingly discharged, while Mrs. Bow
ers was held to appear before the Su
perior Court.
An investigation followed and both
Mrs. Dowers and Mrs. Sutton were
taken into custody. At the inquest it
yas shown that Bowers had died of ar
senical poisoning and Mrs. Sutton was
accused of having secured the deadly
drug on a forged prescription.
Mrs. Martha E. Boners was found
guilty of murder in the first degree by
a jury in Judge Carroll Cook's court
last night. The jury fixed the penalty
at life imprisonment.
The accusation against Mrs. Bowers
and her sister, Mrs. Zylpha Sutton, of
conspiring jointly to slay the husband
of the former forms an interesting:
chapter in the criminal history of San
Francisco. Last August Bowers, who
wSs a bridge builder by occupation,
died, supposedly of ptomaine poison
ing. Certain circumstances connected
ivith his death, notably the facts thai
Mrs. Bowers was at the time consort
ing with one Patrick Lervy and had
drawn a large sum of money from the
bank, aroused tuspicion.

PARIS, Jan. 20.â There is strong rea
son to believe .that exchanges of com-:
munications are now going, on between
France and Russia concerning th 3. po
sition Russia will finally adopt in re
sponse to the last Japanese note. Long
conferences between Foreign Minister
Delcasse and Russian Ambassador
Nejidof are being .held almost ( -.daily. .
Prior to these Russia had not consulted:
France and Nelidof went to. Cannes., for!
an extended stay, telling his diplomatic,
colleagues that he happily tiad no part
in. the Russo-Japanese., negotiations.
Following .the presentation, of Japan's
last demands, Nelidof gave up Jils ya-:
cation and began frequent conferences
with Delcasse. .
It is expected that the exchange of
views will exert a Btrong influence in
shaping the course Russia will adopt.'
Among the officials and diplomats it is
understood here that the exchanges
will have the following results: ' .'"Â¦â¢[.
First, Russia, appreciating the decis
ive nature of the Issues presented In
Japan's last note, desires to obtain the
advice of her neargst political friend;
and second, France wishes to exercise
her influence to \ prevent , a war in
which she \ might become | embroiled.

realize that she ought to be. consulted,
concerning Russia's course in: , . China,

from the north all day, and to-night a

ered with snow to a depth it is said of
five inches. Lack of rain in this part of
the State is causing the loss of a large
number of cattle, which for want of
food and water are near the- point, of

And right here may be cited the main ob
ject, of arbitration treaties. Their apparent
object is to facilitate the arbitration of -dis
puted questions. , but their, real purpose la to
give the cool headed diplomats of the world
a chance to play?a '.'waiting" or
game untllthe rabble come to their senses. In
this way the statesmen gain -'an opportunity to
adjust matter* according; to international law
*and justice. This is the game being played by
our Eastern f riends, * and- Is the factor that
makes an Eastern war improbable.
Louis; T. Hengstler, professor of in
ternational law at the University of
California, and a man well versed in
the politics? of the -world, believes the
chances for war between Japan and
Russia are' remote, indeed.' His view
of it is that the controversy now go
ing on will wind up in a big cloud
of smoke. Where. there is so much
talk there is Jittle chance ; left for
fighting, so that trom all' appearances
the jawing the two nations are giving
each other. will soon cease. Professor
Hengstler said these things - in his
class-room to-dayi where he" gives lec
iures on international law. Here" is
what he said: Â¦ :
The chances for war between Japan and Rus
cia are very slight.: Whenever nations do io
much talking they usually do little fighting.
Certain treaties exiet hetween those two coun
trtes which make war between them practically
impossible. Among these are many commercial
treaties, but I especially refer in this connec
tion to those treaties which give the diplomat
ists of- the two countries a chance to talk. Â¦
The cool statesmen of neither country, desire
war. 'Among their "number may be counted
mine Â¦. of the brightest minds In . the world.
These men do not. wish war; they are playing
a waiting game. It ' is their object to talk
"treaty \ obligations" ;a.nd "concessions" until

In any. summary of the causes of our
success , in steel manufacture great
stress must be laid upon- the early and
multiplied adaptation of electricity as
a motive power in . the -thousand and
one uses ta which it has lent itself so
admirably. Among other applications
tha^ come to mind there are the over
head traveling, electric crane; the elec
tric charging machine that picks up a
box containing a, ton of mixture,
thrusts it into the furnace, empties and
withdraws it; the electric conveyer;
the electric elevator for loading 'the
blast furnaces; the electric buggies
that receive the heated, ingot after it
has been lifted from the soaking pits
and runs it down to the mill; electric
machines for pushing the blooms in
at one. end of the furnace, and electric
tongs for gripping them and pulling
them out at the other end. These are
a few of the uses of electricity, to say
nothing of pneumatic and hydraulic
power. that, conjointly with similar ex
hibitions of ingenuity, forethought and
administrative skilr in mine, ship and
railroad, have enabled our manufac
turers to sell "three pounds of steelfor
2 cents," . .while . paying the highest
wages in the world to labor and re
turning the princeliest of fortunes to

NEW YORK, Jan. 20.â Desiring, it is
said, to prosecute claims against its
former board of directors to recover
$1,855,000 dividends alleged to have been
Illegally paid out of its stock, instead
of from profits, and $650,000 damages
caused by the alleged fraudulent man
agement of the property, the American
Malting Company to-day asked leave
to file an amended answer to an action
in which it is named as defendant, to
gether with Charles XL Warner, one of
Its former directors, by Archibald M.
Hutchinson and Victor K. llcElhany
Jr.. in behalf of -themselves and- other
stockholders similarly situated. The
plaintiffs are seeking to recover by this
and similar suits from Warner and
other directors the $1,855,000 in divi
dends and $C50,000 alleged damages.
The American Malting Company was
organized as a New Jersey corporation
with a capital of $30,000,000. After pay
ing for the various plants acquired, a
*um of $2,000,000 was left in the treas
ury to conduct the business. Five div
ider.ds of 1% per cent each were paid,
the stock of the company going to a
high figure.
The plaintiffs allege that the pay
ment of these dividends lcndered the
company practically insolvent, so that
.the directors had to borrow $4,000,000 on
a bond issue, for which they had to pay
10 per cent; $250,000 is alleged to have
been wasted out of the $4,000,000, while
the $4,000,000 paid for undor riting the
bond ifsue is also characterized as

.At the Foreign- Office it was . ex
plained in a general and unofficial way
with reference to : foreign settlements
at the open Manchurian ports that no
reservation was made in the recogni
tion of acquired treaty rights, but In
asmuch as the Russian military and
civil authorities were now exercising
joint control with China, Russia natur
ally must be consulted on questions
arising out of consular
including settlements. , â¢ .â¢ - , "Â¦.
A high official said that the anti-
American irritation in certain govern
ment quarters here was due to the con
viction that Japan's aggressiveness was
largely the result of the American atti
tude, which, he added, presumably was
based on the fear, that the Manchurian
treaties would not be '" respected, al
though the official 'insisted that; the
United States was informed " r sohie
months ago that Russia would recog
nize them.
'? A; confusion of Olongapo,- in. Subig
Bay, near Manila, with Yongampho;
on the Yalu River, has led the Russian
press- intp - a attack, on .the
United States. The statement that
Rear Admiral Evans' squadron was to
proceed to Olongapo. was either garbled
in transmission' or misunderstood; for
it was reported here that the destina
tion of the American ships was "Yon'g
ampho." This error was made the basis
of an attack on the motives ' of the
United States by the Nov.oe Vremya
and the Listok, both papers pretending
to see in this move the entrance of the
United States in the quarrel. The Novoe
Vremya' remarks: t 'Â« ,
"At least America will be an .open
enemy, which is preferable to a secret
one."
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 20.â The

It is pointed .out; at .the Foreign Office
that Great Britain, .being such an in

and can scarcely . recommend such a
course to her. ally.
Whether or not Japan will "insist to
the bitter end on a treaty recognizing

believes the Japanese themselves will
not decide until after the delivery of
the Russian reply, which is* scarcely ex

Continuing, the Temps reviews the

attributed to the ratification of the

this may be, "according to the view

happy conclusion of misunderstand

"It depends much upon the wisdom

charges of the Bar Association of
Jamestown against State Supreme
Court Justice W. B. Hooker, j former
representative in : Congress, were
brought before the State Bar Associ
ation to-day. The charges quote the
report of Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General Bristow relative to alleged ir
regularities in the postoffices at Dun

appointments and rentals of post
office buildings, and sets forth that M.
.H. Taylor, named in General Bris

recommendation, and that Justice
Hooker was and is one of the own
ers of the postofllce building at Dun

of excessive rental. The Jamestown
association believes the time has ar
rived when it is imperative that
Justice Hooker should, in defense of
the character of the bench, which it
is his high duty to "preserve untar

accusations against him." The James

Captain Manter was asked various
questions as to the state 1 the weather
between 9 and 9:30 o'clock, about the
time the Holyoke reached the Clallam.
He replied that he could not tell just
what it was there, but that at 9 o'clock
when he was going down the Sound he
found it very rough. It * was blowing
hard.
Captain Manter stated that he first
approached the Clallam to. within 100
feet, but that he did not care to get
closer.
"We (the Sea Lion) could not get up
alongside." said the captain. "If I had
got alongside the Clallam and we had
come together that would have been
the last of the Sea Lion, too." "^
Purser Treer testified that the first
information he had of anything beinj:
wrong on the Clallam came from Chief
Engineer de LaunayT
"Half an hour after I talked with the
chief I got out the life preservers and
it was perhaps within forty minutes
from the conversation with the chief
that the boats were lowered. It was no
j great length of time in any event," said
the witness.
"Was there any protest from those
aboard about the people' going i- the
! boats?" was asked.
' "None at all. Everybody seemed to
j think it the best course. I certainly
1 did. Yes, I thought it a good plan to
leunch the boats at that time and ap
parently everybody thought it a good
plan."
SEATTLE, Jan. 20.â Captain Charles
C. Manteiv master of one of the res
cue tugs, and Frank Treer, purser of
the lost vessel, were the principal wit
nesses in the Clallam disaster investi
gation to-day.* Briefly, Captain Manter
outlined the part he and his vessel had
played in the rescue of the passengers
and the crew of the Clallam immediate
ly after the steamer foundered. Treer
described the scenes prior to the rink-
Ing of the vessel from' the time he be
gan distributing life preservers up un
til, a fc-v minutes before the Clallam
went down. His was one of the nar
rowest escapes.
SAN BERNARDINO, Jan. 20.â James
Burns, the young son of a well-known
San Bernardino architect, had an ex
perience to-day which he will not soon
forget. He and several companions
were playing near the Santa Fe Rail
road track on I street when they de
cided to climb on a freight^ train which
had stopped for water. When the train
started Burns failed to jump off and
as it increased its speed he became
afraid to do so. He at first yelled for
help, but the roar of the train drowned
his voice. Then he clung to the ladder
on the side of the car, expecting each
minute to be swept off by the rushing
wind. Peoole who saw him clinging
there waved their arms wildly at the
train crew, who waved their hats in
answer, never for a moment suspecting
the real cause of the unusual attention
which the train was attracting. At
Verdemont, ten miles away, the train
had to' take to a siding, and then it
was that the bit of a form cllngtns
with superhuman effort to the ladder
was discovered. Young Burns dropped
unconscious into the strong arms of
a trainman and for . awhile it was
supposed he was seriously injured, but
he soon revived and told the story of
his frightful ride. His hands were raw
where he clutched the ladder and his
knees were black and blue where they
had pounded against the car.-
CARSON", Xev., Jan. 20. â At a session
of the State Board of Pardons held to
day the sentence of^death imposed on
Cochi Seegmuller, an Indian, was com
muted to life imprisonment. He kilted
William Williams; wh*p was better

is sixteen years of age, was workins
for Williams and when he asked for his
wagies he was run off the farm and
told that if he returned he would be
killed. SeegmuUer returned and while
Williams was asleep shot him to death.
After the murder the boy returned to
his parents* camp, where he told of hits
crime. He was arrested soon afterward
and when called for trial entered a
plea of guilty and was sentenced to

Mrs. Eddy recognizes and teaches that all
thoughts and; actions that are contrary to the
iaw of God are sinful, and must result in suf
fering until they are overcome through the
power of Christ. She does not ignore sin, nor
deny that It exists on the mortal plane as
an evil belief, but claims that it does not orig
inate in God and has no existence in the
realm of spirit.
The teaching of Christian Science concern
ing sin hus â¢ been greatly misunderstood and
misrepresented by Its critics, but a right un

shall know the troth and the truth shall 'make

Editor Call: The statement Dr. Dowle'a
secretary published tn The Call to-day that
the difference between the teachings of Dr.
Dowie and those of Mrs. Eddy, of the Chrirtlan
Science church, is that Mm. Eddy "claims
that there Is no such thing; as Kin, while Dr.
Dowie Bays sin exists on this earth and that It
can only be wiped out" by faith," Is mislead
ing.
The following communication was
received yesterday by The Call:

Christian Science.
Craig says that Dowie came to this |
city from Australia during 1S88. He j
carried a letter of introduction from
Craig's father, and immediately friend- .
ship was established. Dowie was poor j
and humble at the time and had not
the necessary wherewith to even settle
with his landlord. The man of com
merce pays he extended the hospitality
of his home to him, and at' the time
of his departure for the East was I
obliged to settle, with another friend,
his hotel bills. There wag ' also coin
which Craig says he paid out for other
bills, but which he pays he will not
attempt to collect.
The debt In dispute is said to have
been incurred in this city between Octo
ber 9 and December 11, 1S88, when
Craig, at the request of Dowie, laid out
and expended for the reformer the sum
of 52727 36, of which but $962 46 has
been paid. It appears that Dowie de
sired to rent an auditorium for the
purpose of holding religious meetings.
He secured the Grand Opera-house for.
a week, but the gate receipts were not
up to expectations and Craig had to
make good the deficiency. Dowie, be
ing poor, was not dunned for the
money, but when he established his cify
in Illinois and made his fortune Craig
thought it no more than proper that a
request for a settlement be made. "When
Craig met the -reformer soon* after his
arrival in the city he reminded him
that there was a balance due. Dowie
admitted that such was the case and
that Craig had expended the cash,\but
said he paid it out in the spirit of
friendship and that It was not neces
sary for the money to be refunded to
the donor.

' Attorney Meyer was in court repre

who has been engaged to defend Gar-,

The Judge granted a continuance on

fendant's attorney to secure witnesses
in this State to appear in court to sup
port the motion and would then con
sider what action he would take re

stating that if given time he. would
be able to secure her attendance, as,,
she was a most important witness for
the defense. - -,
On the motion to set aside the in

filed an affidavit yesterday for the de
f"w.dant in which it is alleged that
while Mrs. Coit was testifying in the
Police Court she was suffering great
mental anguish and physical pain, and
the defendant had been informed that
she was at the time nqt in a mental
condition to testify; that she had com
plained of being sick and unable to
be subjected to a cross-examination. It
was also alleged that the defendant
could prove by her that the transcript
of her testimony made by Court Sten
ographer Bloom did not conta t n a true
and correct statement of the same;
that she had testified she was unable
to give a correct detail of the commis
sion of the offense, and did testify that
she did not see the defendant shoot
the deceased; that the transcriDt was
incorrect in many material instances;
that Mrs. Coit had testified the de
fendant was crazy at the time, which
was not in the transcript, and that if
given time defendant could produce
Mrs. Coit in court to bear out these
allegations. . â¢
An affidavit was also filed by Grady
practically to the same effect and stat
ing that he had been unable to obtain
a copy of the transcript of the testi
monv till late in the evening of Janu
ary 19.
A few days ago he made a motion
to set aside the information on the
ground that the defendant had been
illegally held to answer by the com
mitting magistrate and yesterday he
made application for a writ of habeas
corpus for the release of the defendant.
The writ* was made returnable this
morning. *

Little significance is placed in the
contents of the woman's * letter, Â¦Â¦â¢ as it
is supposed to have been written by
Blaise's wife, who had no inkling of
her husband's death. Detective Gib
son will have the other translated
some time to-day. , , ;
Gibson said yesterday that he .was ?
not investigating the statements^ of
the two Union-street carhouse '/men,
who said they, thought they saw a
man resembling Blaise on the night of
the murder. Neither of them is cer
tain that the man was Blaise and their
statement that he appeared to be
drugged Is considered evidence that
the one they "saw"'! was not Blaise, !
BLAISE NOT; DRUGGED.
It is known positively by medical
testimony that Blaise was not drug
ged prior to his murder. There was
no sign of the dead man having had a
death struggle with his slayer.
The police are of the opinion that
Boland and Collins saw some one else
consider the occurrence mereJy a
.coincidence. < The main reliance that
â¢the police -are placing in the securing
of enough evidence to convict Soeder
of the murder is in the characters
along Barbary Coast. Soeder was a
habitue of the low dance halls and sa
loons throughout that portion of the
city.
The police now have, in addition to
Cannon and the King woman, two
other women, Maggie Bennett and
Rosie Kirk, from the O K dance hall,
who claim to have seen Soeder short
ly after the murder was committed.
They also have other witnesses, but
refuse to divulge their names, fearing
to ; give the. attorneys for Soeder a
chance to prepare .their defense and
repudiate any evidence so far col
lected.
The two' letters addressed to Soeder
and received Tuesday by Morltz Meien
berg of 4800 Mission street were given
to Soeder to read at the City Prison
yesterday. One was in a man's hand
writing and .was mailed from Drags
burg, Germany, and the other was writ
ten in a woman's hand and mailed from
Hub, Germany.
SOEDER .GIVEN" "LETTERS.
Detective Gibson said last night that
he would hear, the man's story to-day.^
"I have received several letters andf
notes from this man," Gibson said, "but
I cannot give out his name yet. He
says that Leon Soeder was with him
the day before the- murder and that he
had hiis ; pockets full of poison. What
the poison was " I* will not say until, I
take his statement." - â¢ - r Â¦ '>Â¦ .
This new piece of evidence j is con
sidered of great importance by' Gibson,
in view-of the fact- that Soeder was
known 'to have had hydrocyanic acid,
chloroform and carbolic acid .in his
possession prior to the commission of
the murder. It merely further corrobo
rates the poison story, as already pub
lished that Soeder first planned to use
poison and afterward abandoned that
plan. Hydrocyanic, acid was found in'
the trunk of Solder and> he had * car
bolic acid and chloroform in his room
on Jackson street. ' . â¢ ' -. -
Detective Thomas Gibson has a man
who was with Soeder the day before
the murder of Blaise, who says that
Soeder was ."loaded down" with poison.
The person who make3 tnis statement
has been hanging around polioe head
quarters for the last three days trying
to give his testimony. ' * *

ALSO APPLIES FOR WRIT
Files an Affidavit on the
3Iotion of His Attorney to
Set Aside the Information
Hugh Craig, one of the best known
figures in commercial circles in this
city, asks that the courts assist him in
recovering $1764 90 and costs, which he
alleges Dowie has owed him since 18$8.
The attorneys for the plaintiff say that
the modern "Elijah" does not repudiate
the debt, but claims that It was money
paid in the Fpirit of charity and friend
ship, and that it is not a moral or a
legal obligation. He refuses to settle
and will fisht the suit. Craig & Craig,
attorneys for the plaintiff, say that
they. do not propose to delay Dowie"s
GHOST IX SHAPE OF DEBT.
The ghost lii the shape of an old
debt that arose in the path of John
Alexander Dowie yesterday and re
sulted in his display of ire last even
ing carries a story that lapse?
bark over a period of years. It i? an
incident of a time when the landlord
of the terrestrial Zion came to this city
more Christ like than on the present oc
c-agion. His garments were not as ra
diant and he was accepting alms. Since
the luster of Ws wealth has shone upon
him those vino gave ask for an ac
cotntlng. The machinery of the courts
has been set in motion and there Is
trouble ahead for the man who patches
broken limb? -and heals wounds by
"faith" and "the will of God."
RELIGION AND BUSINESS.
The meeting' opened â¢ as usual with
gospel reading, followed by a long
prayer, which, if answered, will assure
all followers of this latter day prophet
a soft berth on earth and crowns of
glory in the greater kingdom of heaven.
Arising from his knees, he at once
proceeded to hui 1 invectives at Hugh
Craig, who earlier in the day had ap
plied to the courts for an order com
pelling the founder o-f a terrestrial Zion
to pay an old debt of more, than $1700.
Dowie was indignant, and stated that
this was merely an attempt to black
mail him. He announced that the
properties which he is managing are
worth $20,000,000, and further. If he has
wronged any man he will pay him
seven-fold.
While tho prophet was hur.orcd with
a full house, he was dishonored by
hundreds who had evidently forgotten
the biblical story of the boys who were
eaten uo by bears for dishonoring the
bald head of a prophet and risked a
similar fate by interrupting the speech
of the modern Elijah with laughter,
coughing and hisses.
Although, according to Dowie, he is
a simple servant or the Lara,' acting
at present as an advance agent for the
second coming of the Master* he was
not averse to using a little fairy lan
guage regarding mundane affairs. In
fact his entire talk was an incongru
ous mixture of Bible quotations, relig
ious exhortations and braggadocio
boasting vf the extent of his fortune.
The platform was filled with his fol
lowers, but he offered no exhibits to
.prove his miraculous powers of healing.
San Francisco audiences are not ap
parently to the liking of the prophet.
During his discourse he told of having
addressed audiences in all parts of the
United States*, but never had he met
â¢with so many Interruptions as in this
city. He followed this statement with
the terrifying threat that if the audi
ence did not quit interrupting he would
clo^e the meeting: at once. The'threat
had no effect, nor was it carried out.
as the interruptions continued at in
tervals, until the prophet, with hands
folded before him. eyes closed and face
pointed heavenward, pronounced the
benediction in a voice inter which a
carefully studied tremolo was intro
duced. During the entire meeting his
role seemed more of actor than preach
er, and this, combined with the tem
perament of the audience, gave one the
Impression that a farce was being en
acted.
Jn the matter of attendance the
jtrirphot. jis personated by John Alex
a:ii>i: Dowie, was not dishonored last
niSht. The Alhambra Theater, where
he occupied the center of the stage for
about two hours and talked on reliff
lon or any other .subject which inisht
present itself to him. was thronged with
the curious, the devotees and thÂ« ordi
nary idlers.

passed the 'Hepburn pure food bill'to

serting the word "skillful" with refer

or misbranded goods and. which would
have compelled " the Government : to
prove intent to violate the law by the
venders was stricken out. on an aye and
no vote in the House. - Several attempts
were made to amend the bill,- but no
material changes -were made.
The bill fixes the standards of foods
and drugs as to their purity, strength
and character, and defines what shall
be 'Â¦. considered adulterations J or mis

The House committee having consid

for the purchase or condemnation of
the Calaveras Big Trees reported fa
vorably to-day. This bill will-be substi
tuted in the Senate for the bill pending
there introduced by _ Senator Perkins,
the machinery of the House bill for
carrying out its purpose being similar.
Similar bills to correct the deficiency
have been before Congress for twenty
years and have many times been fa
vorably reported.
The claim grows from the fact that
in all other such States this provision
was incorporated in the enabling act
by which they became States and has
been operative from the first. Califor
nia missed this benefit through the
manner in which It was taken into the
sisterhood without an enabling act. ,

famous so-called "5 per cent , bill" of
California, which provides that the
State shall receive 5 per cent of all pub
lic lands sold within Its borders. The
total net proceeds of these sales amount
to date to $17,866,252, which means that
$893,312 shall be transferred from the

Plaintiff Seeks Heavy Damages From
Master and Journeymen Horse
*Â«hocrs' Organizations.
The jury in the case of J. H. Mc-
Carty, who sued the Master Horse
fhoers' Union for 5100,000 damages,
Â«ks unable to arrive at a verdict last
night and was discharged. It is said
that at first nine of the jurors favored
the plaintiff, but as there was a dis- ,
agreement regarding the amount of
dem&ge*. one changed his vote and
stood with the defense. As repeated
balloting brought no further change,
the jurymen reported their inability to
arrive at a verdict and were accord
ingly diFcharÂ»?-ed.
McCarty claims that the Master Horse
shoers' Association and the Journey
men Horseshoers' Union conspired to-'
gether to drive him out of business on
City Hall avenue. It appears from his
complaint in the action that for a
number of years he had been a mem
ber of the association and that last
January he was expelled and a boy
cott placed against his business. The
boycott was participated in by the
journeymen's union and the masters'
P.F*ociation, with the result that after
a few wfks McCarty lost all his cus
tomers and was compelled to close his
business.
In filing the action for damages Mc-
Carty complained that he was the vic
tim of a conspiracy entered into by
his fellow employers and the journey- ,
m*n, who sought to drive him out of I
business because he did not live up to
an agreement existing between them to
k^ep up the price of shoes and to re
frain from soliciting trade. I
The trial of the case occupied
twenty-five days in Judge Hunt's
court.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.â Senator
Morgan to-day introduced a bill pro
viding for the annexation of Panama to
the United States, "the rights and
property of Panama resting in the
United States without -cerve." The
bill appropriates $10,000,000 as compen
sation to Panama for its cession,
places $10,000,000 at the disposition of
the President for compensation of Co
lombia and appropriates $60,000,000 for
the purchase of the property of the
New Panama Canal Company in Co
lombia, including the Panama canal.
It is especially provided that the pro
visions of the bill shall not havÂ«_ the
effect of repealing the Spooner act.
Morgan gave notice that he would sub
mit some remarks on the bill to-mor
row.
A preamble to the bill sets forth that
many nations have recognized the se
cession of Panama and the independ
ence of that republic is an accom
plished fact. The bill asserts that the
President of the United States ap
proved and protected the secession
with the naval forces of the United
States and that the President and Sen
ate recognized the independence of the
new republic by appointing and ac
crediting a Minister to that republic.
After providing for the construction of
the Panama canal by the United
States, the bill declares that all the
rights and properties of the republic
of Panama, of every description, shall
vest in the United States of America
without reserve, and shall be subject
to its sovereign jurisdiction.
Senator Morgan also introduced a
concurrent resolution directing the
President to enter into negotiations
with the Governments of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica for the construction of
a canal via the Nicaraguan route.
Two Speeches on Panama.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 20. â Senator
Patterson to-day completed and Sen
ator Platt ' of Connecticut began a
speech on the Panama Canal question.
Patterson declared that the President
was largely responsible for the revolt
in Panama and announced his decided
preference for the Nicaraguan route.
Platt took this pronouncement for
Nicaragua as the text for his remarks,
saying it explained the mystery of the
otherwise unexplainable opposition, on.
the part of the Democratic Senators,
to the Panama treaty.

ers and jobbers of this city and else
where In the State, enjoining them from
Felling as "Old Crow" whisky any whis
ky or spirits not manufactured and dis
tilled by the plaintiff corporation at its
distillery In Frankfort. Kentucky.
These suits are the result of an inves
tigation which has been secretly con
ducted by TV'. A. Gaines & Co. in this
city and State and on the Pacific Coast,
to ascertain the firms that were putting
en the market an Inferior Imitation of
the famous "'Old Crow" brand of Ken

Â»*ntatlv# of W. A. Gaines & Co., who has
b<?Â«>n in this city for months on this spe
risl mission, in conjunction with detec
tives from a well-known private agency,
purchased a quantity of the spurious
article in case* and bottles, at ridicu
lously low prices, from prominent Job
bers * and retail liquor dealers. Over
thrf^ months have been consumed in
running tÂ« earth the traffickers in the
kKijrui? "Old Crow" brand, and the cost
has amounted to many thousand dol
lars. With these proofs in their hands.
V. A. Gaines & Co. have gone into the
I'nited States Circuit Court with peti
tions for injunction and damages against
thr dealers who have been thus engaged
In deceiving the public and Injuring the
business of the corporation, which is re
puted the largest distiller in the world.
Substantial sums offered by way of set-
Ilement out of court have been refused.
th* purpose of the distiller being to ex
pose and punish the liquor dealers who
l-.ave been Imposing on the trade and in
juring the reputation of the "Old Crow"
Â¦whisky, which has received universal
Teroj^iition since 1867. when W. A.
Gaines & Co. adopted "Old Crow" as the
distinguishing trademark for the whisky
which they distill and sell to the world.
"Old Crow" is made from the secret
formula of a Scotchman. Old Jim Crow.
who made the whisky famous as "Old
Cr"w" whisky. In 1S70. and again in
3??2. this trrdemark was registered In
the Patent Office at Washington. W. A.

ALAMEDA, , Jan. 20.â There is a dif
ference of $20 between City Justice' K.
B. Tappan and former Constable George
D. Gray, and the double eagle, which
the magistrate claims the ex-constable
borrowed from him. is the basis of a
civil suit commenced by the Judge to
.recover the coin. In the complaint^ in
the action filed in the court of Justice
of the Peace F. S. Cone appear some
original allegations. After reciting that
Gray came to his law offlce on'Novem
ber; 17 last to obtain $20 with whlgh: tp
buy "tickets," which $20 was "then
loaned to the defendant with j the un
derstanding that it was to be paid.bacfc
nine days later/ Justice Tappan asserts
"that on Saturday. November. 28, 1903,^
as the plaintiff was walking in front of.
the Bank of Alameda, he" happened to
look up, and behind a. telephone polib
sa w the eye and face of the defendant
watching the plaintiff, as a coyote does
a chicken coming down a bushy path,
and after plaintiff had got well around
the corner, easterly from Park. street,
defendant approached plaintiff very
sheepishly and taking two. five-dollar
pieces out of his pocket put th6m on
the ends of two fingers and'. said to
plaintiff, 'Take a shot at \ that. 1 Plain
tiff Immediately became exasperated,
and taking the filthy lucre threw it-vio
lently'at the hoofs of the defendant;"
Justice Tappan alleges that Gray has
never paid him any of the twenty-dol
lar loan, and asks for judgment. for the
amount and costs of court.
The question was brought up to-day
upjn the admission of an old Civil War
veteran by the name of -Louis Jutgens.
He has been voting for years, but lately
it was discovered that he had failed
to have the court admit him to citizen
ship on the showing of; his discharge.
The new law, makes no provision for
such a course and he must now go
through the usual form.
-The form of oatif'to be taken by a
"C?ould-be citizen of this country was
finally agreed upon by the five Supe

When the panels were completed the
question of mounting them upon the
walls became' a most important one. It
was repeatedly, said that It would be
impossible to , mount the decorations
because of thelr*size and the material
upon which they were painted. The
"Library Trustees , turned this difficult
work over to John M. Morrison and
David : Lawler, artists, of San ; Fran
cisco, and they, with the aid, of the
brother and the sister of Mrs.' Pope,
have succeeded In doing what many
said was Impossible. . The <palntlngs
have been mounted upon the, walls and
have been surrounded with moldings,
that ; give . the appearance of frames,
and when Mrs. Pope returns from Ari
zona* where she Is 'at presentvWith her

of ;the pictures that hivo^ been\present
ed, but ; because ."they.wlll; by her efforts,
be able to start. thwart collection which
theyl have b^en (dlscussine. 'for so long.
.The jfplcttires- were donated absolutely!
<even> the; canvas and colors being sup
plied by" the artist
MOUNTING DIFFICULT.
_ There is but one portrait among all
of the figures, and that is of tthe late
Professor Joseph Le Conte as "Science"
in one'of.;the side panels.
v The magnitude of this work can be
estimated from the fact that all of the
figures are life size and that Miss Hol
den had to work upon the canvas from
a ladder. She. was- confronted; with
many difficulties^ that she. had todver
come by her own work. This style of
mural decoration was new upon the
Pacific Coast, and Miss Holden found
it impossible to get the materials neces
sary, for the task. She was compelled
to prepare with her own hands the can
vag;upon which she did her work. The
colors had to be prepared specially, and
were ground with beeswax to give them
the dun shade that was required.
Miss Holden carried out an" idea in
these pictures that was entirely orig
inal with her. She determined to depict
a California Mount Olympus, v with alle
gorical figures representing , the arts
and sciences, but everywhere there was
the California landscape. In the back
ground of the central picture is Mount
Tamalpais as the California,;*"Mount
Olympus, while the general California
landscape and scenery is followed very
carefully. * ,.
X>AKIiAND, Jan. The first move
toward the consummation of a long
cherished plan of the Oakland Free Li
brary Trustees has just been/com
pleted by the installation in the ; nevv
Carnegie Free Library of three* large
panels over the stairway leading to the
second -story;- ( of the building. -These
paneis'are the giftjdf Mrs. Marion'Hol
aenTope of San Francisco, whose work
they are. They are said by art critics
to ;be,.amon&Â»the. finest pieces of art
work that havie been produced by local
artists., and they are very highly prized
by 'the Library ' Trustees of Oakland.
The pictures will form the nucleus of
ah art collection for the public of Oak
land that will" be stored in the new
building and to which the trustees hope
to add from time to time pictnres that
will ba of interest, not alone, for their
artistic worth, but also for the fact
that they are the work of California
artists.
Over the main stairway there were
three large vacant spaces. These could
have been filled with frescoes,'But Miss
Marion Holden of San Francisco, who
is now Mrs. Marion Pope, volunteered
to paint three panels upon cariyas that
could be utilized for these spaces! Mrs.
Pope has wojrked for nearly two" years
upon this work, which is now" almost in
place in the new building.

If the City Council decides to take
favorable action upon the recommen
dation of its' special committee to lease
the Centra Costa Water Company's
plant for twenty years, with option of
purchase, the city is relieved of the
necessity at this time, or for several
years to come., of voting a large- bond
issue to secure a municipal water sup
ply. During the many months of de
liberation in the committee this ele
ment is said to have been given much
In view of the fact that
a very extensive system of public im
provements is contemplated under a
large bond issue.
Members of thÂ« City Council who
have given the subject much thought
took the view that the great purpose
to be accomplished, namely, the ac
quiring of a municipal water supply,
could be realized under the leasing plan
and the way cleared for bonding the
city for other Important public Im
provements without reaching" into Vk'e
15 per cent litnit that hedges the city
by statutory enactment. . > :. .
This. is one of the arguments that
the corqnjlttee in fts, report; has la'd
stress upon >as affecting the financial
Tiew of the- proposed- leasing. -,
The report is before the public and
cannot receive ,fina4 , attention at the
hands -of- the <^it>v Council until the
_agcond [proposition. Jf-Xom the Bay Cities
"Water Company has been received. ThÂ»
.Council has' asked the company to sub

the ceremony performed last week and
made a run for San Mateo in an auto
mobile, but the machine broke down
and .before they reached there Miss
h elfstein's relatives were waiting their
arrival and made such strenuous ob
jection that they Vece separated. Close
watch has been kept on the girl ever
since, but the Stanfields went to the
races this afternoon and Owen received
a telephone message from Miss Helf
stein to go to Oakland, secure the
license and meet her at the Fourteenth
street station when the 3:15 train from
San Francisco arrived. The programme
went through without. a hitch, and, ac
companied by a girl friend. Miss Helf
stein alighted from the train and the
trio immediately took a carriage to go
to the minister's house. .

Governor Taffs Reception.
Mrs. Pettie. president of the Society
for the Prevention of Vice, was given a
tongue-lashing in the corridors of the
Hall of Justice" yesterday by a woman
named Mrs. Erickson. Mrs. Pettie had
caused the arrest of Mrs. Erickson and
her husband on the charge of neglecting
four minor children. When the family
came into Judge Mogan's court the
husband was promptly dismissed, but
for some unknown reason the wife was
held. There was absolutely no evi
dence that the children had been neg
lected. In the courtroom the children*
â¢nppeared clean and well fed and both
the father and mother testified that
every care was given to the young ones.
Both of the parents appeared to be
respectable. The policeman on the beat
Jn front of their home testified that the
< hildrcn were as v.ell cared for as any
ethers in the neighborhood.
When Mrs. Ericksoh encountered Mrs.
Pettie in the corridor the vials of an
outraged mother poured forth. Bailiff
Mahoney was present, fortunately, and
prevented a hair-pulling match. The
Gertie Herth and Hattie Green, two
fashionably attired young women, were
arrested last night by Patrolmen M.
Brady and F. F. Flood, upon complaint
of Henry Mac Vine, proprietor of the
Chicago Tailoring Company, 113 Grant
avenue, who alleges that they attempt
ed to purloin a fur collarette^alued at
$20. Miss Herth's name was entered on
the detinue book pending further in
vestigation, and Miss Green was
charged with petty larceny, subse
quently securing her release upon the
deposit of $200 cash bail. MacVine
states that the two women came into
his store and asked to be shown sev
eral fur garments. The Green woman
carrjed a valise, and MacVine avers
that their actions were suspicious.
While the attention of the saleswoman
was attracted to another portion of the
establishment it is alleged that one of
the women placed the fur in the v ilise.
MacVine noticed that the collarette was
missing and notified the officers. In
the grip was found the missing prop
erty and the arrests followed. Both of
the young women deny the charge, and
Miss Green states that she was in
specting the fur when arrested, and
that it was not found in the satchel.
They reside in apartments at 14 McAl
lister street.
Gertie Hertli and Hattie Green Are

YOUNG WOMEN MUST FACE
CHARGE OF ' SHOPLIFTING
T. I.assada. P. Tongelchi, S. Kalyma,
P. Probi*ki. T. Isakos, S. Tahata, U.
PhiriFhiki and T. Okio were defendants
in Judge Mogan's court. The puzzle is
to aruess what a bunch with a bundle
of names like that were arrested for.
The answer is "for disturbing the
peace." According to the police officers
who put th<Â» men in custody these eight
Japanese are in the habit of mingling
their bristling names with copious liba
tions of beer from a saloon in the vicin
ity of their domicile at 414 Stevenson
sljeet. That kind of a combination
v.ould cause a war among Quakers.
The neighborhood thereabout for two
blocks has been disturbed nightly by
th> orgies of the exuberant Japs until
police interference was the only rem
edy.
The defendants stated to Judge Mo
can yesterday that on the night of their
arrests they were holding "a feast."
On other occasions cited by the police
men when high wassail was held and
:he neighbors lay awake in fear from
the noise, the defendants said it was
merely "a celebration."
"What would the city do if these
Japs had a Fourth of July on their
calendar?" said Judge Mogan, and
"paled at the possibilities. He found
the bunch guilty and will sentence
them to-morrow.
Vincent Le Corvee, the sailor whom
the French Consul wishes turned over
to his custody for deportation to
France, was formally held by Judge
Mogan yesterday on the charge of mur
der. His arrival in the land of his na
tivity will be deferred for such time as
the courts of the United States may
determine, despite the cry of his fath
erland for his presence.
Frank Harris was convicted of petty
larceny yesterday by Judge Mogan.
His conviction was the result oLaquick
question by the Judge, which disclosed
the speciousness of his plea of inno
cence. He was accused of stealing a
banjo from the Bekin Van and Stor
age Company- and several employes
testified to seeing the defendant emerge
from the warerooms on Howard street
with a package. Harris denied on his
direct examination that he had any
kind of a bundle when he left the
premises. When the Judge took him in
hand he asked: "Did the package you
had when you left the warehouse re
semble this banjo and case In any
way?" r
; "No, sir," said the witness. "The
bundle was entirely different in ap
pearance." '"Evidently you are guilty,"
said the Judge, and Harris was
promptly convicted.
1 consider the present situation with regard
to armor \-ery satisfactory. The cost of armor
I can say without any reservation that since

WASHINGTON, Jan. 2O.-Replying to
the m question of the House Committee
o:i Naval Affairs as to whether there
ifc a preliminary understanding con
cerning the price between the Navy
Department and the steel companies oh
manufacturing' armor^^for the Govern
ment. Rear Admiral O'Nell has trans
mitted to the committee a." review -of
the entire period in whicn. the Govern
ment has . had armor njanufactured.
He says that it is impossible to state
whether , there was ; an understanding
between Secretary Tracy nnd the-Car
negie company regarding fche first con
tract for armor. As to hid own knowl
edge of such matters the admiral says:
Oscar Gardner, who is not the
"Omaha Wonder" famed in pugilistic
song and story, is mitigating by de
gree in Judge Mogan's court a' charge
of petty larceny. He is charged with
passing a $10 Confederate note on a
restaurant keeper named Philip George
z-l 127 Seventh street hi payment for
some oysters and receiving the change.
He" is a laborer at Murray's machine
shops and h!s employer was in court
yesterday to repay the missing money.
Gardner clings to the theory that he
received the bogus bill at the Bohemian
Cafe on Jilaiket street. When Judge
Mogan heard tblÂ« he went into a
tranjp. '"I wonder," he mused, "which
one of those outlaws in- that establish
ment could have impoMd this bill on
an innnocent worJdnsman. Tony
Brunswick? Yes, no; yes, no." Finally
he purged the 3bhÂ«mlan Cafe of the
crime and concluded that Gardner
passed the bill during a moment of al
coholic Incompelency.
As the young man is industrious, re
pentant and not the "Omaha Wonder"
and above all because he acquitted
Tony Brunswick of any complicity in
the matter, it is probable he will be al
lowed to settle the case with the res
taurant keeper and then be freed.
Naval Officer Declares Cost

Less Than That Abroad
SAYS THE BIDS AftE FAIR
Judge Cor.Icn Â¦went to the ropes and
Prosecutor Charles Weller took the
count when they tackled the case oi
Lu Him and Tuns Fat yesterday, who
were charged with having: violated the
came laws. The prisoners were ar
rested because they kept in a small
'â¢ape a half dozen birds commonly
known ss Asiatic quail. The birds flew
agair.st the wires and bumped their
head* 1 , and a merciful policeman ar
rested the keepers. It Is a provision
of the game laws that no quail shall
be kopt in captivity. %
But there tverÂ« otner developments
cominpr. Professor Loomis, the orni
thologist from the Academy of Sciences,
went on the stand for the defense. He
said that the imprisoned birds were not
Quail at all; they were merely Coturnix
communis.
"What's that?" gasped Judge Conlan,
Prosecutor Weller and Clerk Jack Bice
in unison. The professor repeated the
name carefully and the official stenog
rapher fell under the table in his en
deavor to get the correct terms. But
thp worst was yet to come. |
Prosecutor "Weller stayed down for
seven seconds, but he came back fresh.
"'Professor," he said, "do not these
birds in evidence bear considerable re
fs^mblance to the quail of California,
for which we pay large prices at our
fashionable restaurants?"
'JfThere are no quail in California."
said the professor. "What is commonly
denominated quail in this State is mere
ly Ortyx Virgiana. with an occasional
specimen of Coturnix communi5."
At this point a woman in the back
of the courtroom fainted, and time was
called.
"The real auail," continued the pro
fessor, still fresh a.nd without a mark,
"belongs to the Dadylisonans and Is
eithei Orlygina or Odontophorina. Of
these there are none In America ex
cept as stuffed specimens."
Prosecutor Weller's second,- Clerk
Rice, threw the sponge into the ring.
Judge Conlan was so dazed that he
could not render a decision and in the
haze everybody lost sight of the fact
that it was only a case of two China
men accused of violating the game |a*w.
A decision will be rendered to-day.

When people, like the Jews, have seen their co-religion
ists oppressed and repressed, and have been appalled by
their murder under shocking circumstances, they are in
a continual state of tension, anticipating that like suffer
ing and misfortune may come again. They look to the
press of the country for their information of events pass
ing and to come. They fear every rumor, and when the
statement is positively made that heartless cruelty, in
spired by religious fanaticism, is about to arm itself again
with torch and bludgeon, with lust and dagger,' to mur
der and rob the defenseless, it is only natural that those
who watch from afar should believe and act accordingly.
But what is to be said for the man who will invent
such things when they have no existence, and who will
affirm them and make them appeal, to his dupes by pic

print in his own columns the ascriptions of praise to him
self, called out by his pretense that: he prevented some
thing that did not happen, nor was likely to happen, and
had no existence outside of his lying invention?

He says that the rece/it reports of a renewal of the
Russian massacres were entirely sensational, started by

that they had no foundation in facttor in reasonable fear,

THE meeting to be held at the Alhambra Theater
this evening under the direction of the California
Postal Progress League will well repay all who aw
tend it. Governor Pardee is expected to preside, and
able speakers will present the merits of the proposed re
form. Were it, therefore, nothing more than an even
ing's entertainment, there would be ample reason why
the meeting should be large. The entertainment of an
audience is, however, the last thing in the minds of the
Postal League, or of the gentlemen who will speak for
it. The object is to direct attention to the urgent need
in' this country of an up-to-date parcels post system, such
as is maintained in almost every other civilized country
on the globe. if v . ,,r.V~,~y _
The excellence of the various express companies in
this country has been the cause of our lagging behind
the nations of Europe in establishing an efficient parcels
carrying system in connection with the postoffice. It is
one of the many illustrations of the proneness f of man
kind to postpone the adoption of great improvements so
long as they can get along with makeshifts. In Great
Britain, for example, where the telegraph service is ex
cellent and cheap, the people have been slow in making
use of the telephones. -So in the United States we. have
been content to put up with the old-fashioned corpora
tion express service instead of keeping abreast of civili
zation, and establishing a parcels post service of first
class efficiency. - Â¦ <. >
While the publicj has been content to go on in the old
way, the express companies have formed a close combi
nation or arrangement among themselves, and they now
have a monopoly that is enormously profitable. They
stand therefore as a formidable opposition to the desired
reform. Against them are arrayed various organizations
like the California Postal Progress League, making the
contest for progress and the public good. In such a con
flict it should be a matter of pride for every progressive,
public spirited citizen to show himself in the meetings
held for reform and get himself counted on the right
side. >i
If all men of the city whdse business interests would
be beneficially affected by the good' parcels post system
were' to jattend this meeting, the Alhambra would not
hold a tenth part of them, , and there would have to be
overflow meetings in the open. air. As a matter of fact
the issue affects every citizen to a greater or less extent,
and every man of influence and leading should do his
share of the work required to bring about the establish
ine'nt of the desired service. ' ' . i

Only thir spring a girl came to seek
my advice. !?he told me her whole
rtcry- how Jxcr relatives in Memphis

realize early in iifÂ« that whatever she
accomplished murt be through her
ov.'ji effort.-'. She was sure she had a
jrood vcicc. r.nd this che determined to
cultivate and make the most of. She
took n. position in a store, saved every
cent the coultt. nnfi after several years
hr.3 enough ahead to take her to Chi
f n.50. There she studied music for two
yuars. And yov may be sure that she
studied harfl. She raa<3c- rapid prog
ress. Finally el:e felt that she was
ready tn begin vrorlr on the etage. Her
teacher, a. friend of r.iinc. sent her to
inc to Â«ecJc auvice. 'As^eoon us Khe
l;ad told me her story and* sung for
mo 1 said to her; "M/ dcai-. you are

Opera Company, and she wrote to
thank me for "what J . had. told her."
'/hn.t .g:ir! has brains; che is bound to
succeed. .'. ._ ' .
Ones given the opportunity on the
stage, It remains for the girl herself
:o force an, advance. Then is the time
when The must use her brains more
than ever. Then comes the chance for

Every young girl who can sing and
v.ants to go on the stage should study
dancing and fencing. Nothing is more
charming in a woman on the stage than
grace, easy carriage, suppleness. And
nothing will give a. girl these priceless
accomplishments so mucn as fencing
tnd dancing. Not that she will have
to aartce or fence on the stage, but the
movemerts she will be obliged to go
through with before the fencing and
dreeing masters iviii give her. body that
suppleness which nothing .else can bring
about. A cingcr will find that she can
ret dance much upon the stage. Danc
ing affects her breathing. She may have
to go through a few steps, but that is
ill. If she wants to sing she will have
10 give D2) everything else.
Another matter of importance. A
einjjer should learn to enunciate dis
tinctly. I can imagine nothing more
v.earlscine than a singer who mumbles
hÂ»;r words bo that only one-tenth of
:hcm. are understood. It would be f^r
better for her to sing in a foreign
tens^je.
It is not necessary to study acting
before a finger expects to go on the
stage. As a matter of fact you can't
study acting.
Net long ago a fond mother brought
h*>r daughter to my house to get ad
vice. The daughter, it seems, had been
studying elocution and acting.
"Well," 1 said to her, "let's see you
do something. Suppose you sing a song
and accompany it with gestures." She
did, and such gestures! I simply had
to laugh. She had tried to make some
one give her what she didn't possess â
brains. Brains is what a singer needs
moFt of all. Give her that and the rest
is easy.
It Is very important that a girl start
ycung. She should be studying music
seriously at 12. She ought not to sing
much until she is 14. Bui after that it
must be a continuous round of study.
She must learn to read music as readily
as she can peruse a newspaper. Every
thing she can learn about, music will
be of assistance to her in her stage
career. There will come a time, when
this knowledge will be of great benefit.
She will find lots of people around the
stage who think they know about mu
sic, but don't. She must be in a posi
tion to tell those people why they are
wrong and she is right when she does
a certain thing in a certain manntr.
Then these ignorant people will have
respect for her. As I said before, it

bank balances and change of accounts, without sending
a dollar out of the country, and will do so as soon as the
Panama treaty is ratified. Tlie balance of trade is so
heavily in our favor that we merely apply the canal pay
ment to its reduction and the nioney that changes hands
and location is paid by Europe and not by us.
While we do not pretend that business depends upon
keeping one party in power, which would be a pretense
antagonistic to free government, yet it is true that con
ditions exist which make it wise sometimes to let well
enough alone. As the minority party appeals for power
always upon its promise to better the material condition
of the people, the voters have a right to use their judg
ment in the matter. Therefore we ask what, improve
ment on present conditions can be expected by a change
of administration?
The opposition, by basing its claim to confidence upon
its promise to make better conditions, is responsible for
declaring a relation, a direct connection, between politics
and business. It is responsible then for the admission
that present conditions originate in the kind of adminis
tration we have. A recital of those conditions, therefore,
is a statement of the substance we have. Will we ex
change it for the shadow offered by the opposition?
Wherever a Democratic conventicle is held and
wherever a Democratic dinner is eaten, whether it be a
dollar or a ten dollar meal, the harping is about the in
dustrial and financial condition of the country. Repub
licans do not have to claim cre.dit for what exists. It is
forced on them by the opposition. They must accept it
whether they wish to or not. So they accept it. They
show opacity to make the first canal payment by not
sending a dollar but of the country. They show a treas
ury surplus large enough to begin the work on the canal
and push it far toward a finish, without issuing a bond.
They even' show a prospect that the annual surplus will
be equal to the whole work, that we will pay as we go,
and that every dollar will be paid as we pay the first dol
lar, by an exchange of balances, the money coming from
Europe to pay for our products. They show such a con
dition of the currency as is equal to paying for and mov
ing the season's crops, and paying the January divi
dends without stringency. â¢Â¦Â¦*'*/
All this is charged to them by the opposition when it
impleads the business situation in politics. What better
can the opposition promise? They say they will prose
cute trusts. They are being prosecuted to disintegration.
They will reform the tariff. The people gave them a
chance in 1892, and they produced a law denounced by
Mr. Cleveland as "a record of perfidy and dishonor." Mr.
Gorman made that record, and he is the party leader in
Congress now. Will Mr. Gorman do any better than he
did then?
The people will have all the facts before them. Is
there any doubt about their decisio'n?
THE plantation value oi the present cotton crop is a
half billion dollars. The South has never before
pocketed as much money for that staple. It has
been forwarded to market and paid for, without the dis
arrangement of currency and money stringency that has
heretofore been caused by the annual movement of the
crops. The staple crops North and South h^ve been
moved without disturbance, and the January dividends,
paid in New York, on industrial stocks, amounting to
$11*5,000,000, have been paid, showing that currency is
sufficiently abundant to serve all the purposes of pro
duction and movement and business, in all parts of the
countrj% without disarrangement or stringency;
These facts arc worth considering, for it is the first
time such a thing has been possible in all our business
history. Not only have these things been done, but the

all right, but when it comes to "By
whom or what injured?" they will
often answer, "None," or "Don't
know." In one report the first ques
tion was answered. "Fell on sidewalk
and cut his chin and broke his nose,"
yet the second question was answered,
"Unknown."
One member of the force In sub
mitting a report of an accident be
gan in a startling manner as there
was no punctuation. He wrote: "As
I left a car while returning from
shooting myself and Officer Blank saw
a man."
A man was seized with an epileptic
flC and the answer to the form ques
tion was, ""By the will of God." An
other was. "He looked like a man in
a fit." A man had fallen on the side
walk and cut his scalp, and the an
sw*er filled in the blank was, "He fell
over himself." Other answers were:
"By horse while running away,"
"Dead," "Injured by none," "By com
ing in contact with the ground."
Ini the printed form recently intro
duced in the Police. Department for
use in giving details of accidents
there is one question that seems to
puzzle many of the blue-coated guar
dians of the peace. It is, "By whom
or what injured?" Several of the an
swers are, to say the least, curious.
The Intelligent Cop.
A calculation based on the number
\ of female enlployes in flve large rail
road dices in New York City indi
: cates that about 6 per cent of the cler
ical staff of a railroad Is made up of
women. Of the 1,150,000 persons now
| employed by the railroads of this
! country not less than 150,000 are In
; the purely clerical service, and apply
ing the proportion of C- per cent to
! 150,000 it is show^n that about 9000
: women are on the railroad payrolls.
i There is, furthermore, palpable evi
; dence that this proportion is rapidly
| increasing. The pay of these female
i clerks ranges from $20 to $60 per
I month, and in cases where there is un
j usual responsibility the competent
| young woman will draw the same
j wage that a man would receive in a
; similar position. The Vanderbilt rail
roads employ about 150 girls and
i women in the Xew York City offices,
. mostly in the accounting departments.
Mrs. Hetty Green, the shrewd con
! server of many millions, is perhaps the
best known railroad woman in the
United States. For several years she
owned the Texas Midland Railroad and
directed its financial affairs, while her
son managed the property as president
and general manager. Mrs. Green be
lieves in railroad securities as invest
| ments, and she is an expert analyzer
j of a railroad report. Within the last
i two years the experiment of employ- j
i ing women conductors has been tried '
on some of the local passenger trains j
on Western railroads. While Mrs. j
Green mav not have originated this '
idea, ehe advocated it for a while and !
was instrumental in securing positions j
as conductc-rs for several women. This ;
experiment, however, never met with â¢
much success. The physical exactions j
of a railroad conductor's life are more j
than the average woman can stand.
There are a few female conductors who
still cling to their jobs, but the ma
jority of those who have ' tried such j
work are ready to admit that the life j
is a little too strenuous. i
As ticket sellers in suburban stations 'â¢
women have succeeded fairly well, and
they are numerously employed in this
capacity throughout the country.
Where the work is light a woman gives
as complete satisfaction as a man and
she gets less pay. President A. J. Cas- j
satt of the Pennsylvania system is a j
stickler for discipline and good service, j
and he has invariably favored the em- j
ployment of women for such work as ,
they are capable of handling. Travel- j
ers in the eastern section of this coun- !
try frequently come upon railroad sta- !
tions which are attractively homelike
because they are tended exclusively by
women. The presence of growing
plants, trailing vines, neat engravings j
on the walls, cushioned settees and j
rocking chairs is not uncommon in New !
England railroad stations, and these j
comforts indicate the dominating care j
of a female a~ent. ;
In the Far West, where a rugged life j
and exposure to inclement weather for |
both sexes are more common than in |
the East, women station agents are by
'Â¦ no means a rarity. Many of thest are
to be found along tfie Northern Pifciflc,
the Great Northern and the Chicago, \
: Burlington and Quincy lines. In some
instances these female statfon agents
are the wives of men employed in j
other departments of railroading, but
a majority of them are women, young
and middle-aged, who are obliged to
support themselves. Each one, of
course, must demonstrate, her ability ;
and responsibility in some way before j
the full measure of authority is vested
in her. All station agents handle more
'. or less money received for express and.
freight charges, as well as from the
sale of tickets. When Charles S. Mel
ten was president of the Northern Pa- ;
cific he took especial pains to collect in- j
formation regarding the work of the !
' female station agents, and he found !
; that their average of efficiency was as
high as that of the men. The official
reports and money accounts sent in pe- j
riodically by the women employes were, Â¦.!
! as prompt, clear and accurate as sim- ;
, ilar reports from the male agents. ' !
While neglect of duty is very uncom- j
mon among railroad employes gener-j
1 ally, the statement is frequently heard
in railroad offices that women arc more
watchful of little things than the men.
A female" station agent, as a- rule, will
1 take better care of the company's prop
erty than the average man would, for i
the reason that v/omen wage-earners !
are naturally less wasteful than men. !
The cay of an agent in charge of a |
! small station Is usually about $50 a
month. A man in receipt of that sti
pend will perform his daily duties as a
matter of course, but he docs not feel
it incumbent upon him to give much j
extra attention, to the care of the sta
tion itself or of the fixtures and furni
ture. A woman, on the other hand,
v.-ill put herself out to keep the station I
in as good condition as possible, for in '
a sense it Â»s her domicile, and she I
wants to have her surroundings as neat I
and agreeable as the conditions will al-
Jow. ' ' â¢

Women have been coming: into the
railroad business in steadily increasing:
numbers in recent years until now
they constitute an. Important factor in
many of the general offices. From the
ranks of stenographers and typewrit
ers there have been numerous promo
tions of women to places of trust and
responsibility, and. there are conspic
uous instances of the development of
exceptior-al ability in a female private
secretary, or female . head of a cler
ical department. The presidents of

NO CLOUDS IN BUSINESS.
Mr. Wolf is wise and right in his advice to his people.
There are real occasions enough- for an appeal to the
American people, in time of genuine need, without being
led into making one that is unnecessary, in order that a
yellow journalist may add to his list of indorsements
gained by falsehood those secured by this peculiarly
cruel and 'unjustifiable deception.
There are in Austria, Germany and France influential
Jews,' who have every means and the best means of
knowing what goes on in Russia. More than that, there
are Jews in'.close, contact with the St. Petersburg Gov
ernment, with about as good facilities for knowing what
goes on as Esther had in the court of Ahasuerus. With
these facilities it was very unlikely that their American
-brethren would be left* tp depend for information on the
prince and primate of American newspaper fakers.
But people whose minds are distressed do notÂ«stop to
analyze, nor to examine all considerations involved in
such a matter. They have been harmed, their sentiments
and impulses exhausted in useless action,, their rest and
calmness have been banished, their capacity for attention
to their daily affairs has been impaired and they have been
injured in nerve and pocket, yet the adroit liar who did it
coldly calculated from the beginning upon his capacity
to secure their praise and, flattery, though he had done
them" only harm and knew from the beginning that they
would be harmed. They are not to blame because they
believed the sensation monger when he cried out that
their distant people were in danger, but his conduct was
on a par with that of the man who rushes to a family to
teir them that one of their number 'has been seriously
hurt on the next street, and then takes advantage of
their immediate rush for the scene of a tragedy that
has not happened by going in and robbing the vacant
house.

Passenger Traffic Manager E. O.
McCormick of the Southern Pacific
Company yesterday had prepared by
Statistician Jackson of the passenger
department a statement concerning
the tourist traffic over the company's
lines during the years 1902 and 1903.
It contains some interesting compara
tive figures. It shows that during the
spring of the year 1902 tourist tickets
were on sale for sixty-one days and
the average dally sale was 197. Dur
ing the same season of 1903 the tick
ets were sold for 121 days and the
average daily sale was 364 tickets,
the increased sale of the latter year
over 1902 being 84.7 per cent In the
fall of 1902 tickets were sold for
sixty-one days and the average daily
sale was 407 tickets. In 1903. they
were on sale for seventy-six days and
averaged 530 dally, or an increase of
30 per cent.
"These figures," remarked Mr. Mc-
Cormick yesterday, "plainly suggest
to us that the proper time for the
railroad company and the people of
the State to encourage this westbound
movement is during the fall, for in tlte
spring the Eastern farmer Is busy
putting In his crop and has no time to
leave his farm and look around. In
Iowa and Ohio the majority of -the
leases on the farms terminate during
April and March, and a man cannot
very well leave his home, in those
months, for, he is busy engaged in,
renewing his lease and preparing to
set out another crop. .
"In the fall, he can come West, and
if he sees a eood future "for himself
and -family here he is afforded ample
time to return to the East and make
his arrangements for moving the fol
lowing year. Our reports for .the
two years mentioned show . the total
tourist traffic/to have been 121,903, of
which 36.223 came West in 1902 and
84,980 in 1903, a very satisfactory
record and one that 'encourages ; us .In
believing that our future efforts In the
tourist' business will meet with still
greater results." â¢ \

The taking of testimony before the
Civil Service Commissioners in the
case of certain employes of the Health
Department who claim they were ille
gally ousted from their positions was
completed yesterday afternoon. The
case will be argued before the'com
missioners Saturday morning at 11
o'clock.
Former Assistant Secretary Cam
eron was the first witness called yes
terday. On direct examination by ex-
Judge Slack he testified that he had
taken the civil service examination
for experienced clerk and was assigned
to the Health Department. He kept
the books and. attended to such other
clerical duties as were required of
him. W r hen asked by Mr. Ruef if he
were competent to fill the positions of
secretary, assistant secretary, book
keeper, statistician and food inspector,
which ha've been combined under the
name of assistant health officer and
are now being filled by Louis Levy,
the witness said he was not.
Secretary Mo'ran of the Civil Service
Commission next took the stand. His
testimony consisted chiefly of figures
relating to the number of examina
tions held, the number of applicants
and the present status of the eligible
lists. There are at present, accord
ing to his figures. 2100 civil service
employes whose salaries total $2,200,
000. This includes members of the
Police and Fire departments, many of
whom did not take the examinations,
but were on the roll prior to the in
stitution of civil service. The city also
employs 1897 persons whose positions
do not come under civil service at an
annual expense of The
school teachers are included in this
list. Of the 2100 employes under the
civil service classification Mr. Moran
teetified that about*700 had taken the
regular examinations.
James McQuade, who fills the new
ly created post of deputy warden at
the City and County Hospital, was
called and closely questioned, the ob
ject of the inquiry being to determine
what difference, if any, existed be
tween his duties and those performed
by David I. Wolfe. Wolfe was a civil
service- man and classified # as secretary
of the hospital. His position was
abolished on January 9 and McQuade
was given the position of deputy war
den. McQuade testified that while his
duties were largely clerical they were
also executive. He related his duties
in detail and Wolfe, who followed him
on the stand, stated that as secretary
his duties had been identical with
those of McQuade. This closed the
case for the contestants, and as Mr.
Ruef had no witnesses to call the
board adjourned until Saturday, when
arguments will be heard.

the medical firm of Dr^Talcott & Co.
for $452 due for advertising 1 space
furnished Talcott by a morning news
paper was tried yesterday before
Judge Hebbard and taken under sub
mission by the court. Talcott admit
ted owing the money, but pleaded
poverty as his reason for falling to
liquidate. "I will pay the bill when
I get the money," he said.
Notwithstanding his expressed will
ingness to pay, Talcott conveyed a
different impression* by his testimony.
He stated that the bill was contract
ed by the firm of Dr. Talcott & Co.
before ty had been incorporated and
then admitted that he owned 75 per
cent of the stock in the concern. He
did not. however, make this admis
sion until the court had told him that
he must answer the question as to his
interests. He* then remembered and
stated that he believed he owned 75
per cent of the stock and the rest of
it was owned by his wife, his brother
in-law and one Frank Fornio. He
admitted also that the Incorporation
owned all the Instruments and furni
ture of the unincorporate firm of Dr.
Talcott & Co. and that the Instru

over to the corporation by him. He
could not, however, remember wheth

a result of the change in the city's ad
ministration by. removing some fifty
employes from their positions and ap
pointing the^r successors to the va

pected that Boland's testimony "will

Supervisor Braunhart called the at
tention of the Supervisors' Finance
Committee yesterday to a circular let
ter being, sent to citizens by the firm of
Fox & Friend, real estate, insurance
and general brokers, 214 Pine street,
stating that said citizens had paid ille
gal taxes for hospital and new school
houses-and requesting an assignment
of their claim for collection on a basis
of 50 per cent commission, and he re
quested the Finance Committee to take
some action whereby the citizens might
be informed that the Board of Super
visors intended, if possible and legal,
to refund the taxes collected, and in
case this could be done they would be.
at no expense.
The committee decided to prepare a
resolution calling the attention of the
public to the resolution requesting the
City Attorney's opinion as to whether
yiere is any legal way in which the,
money might be refunded, and also no
tifying them that it is the Intention of
the board, if possible, to return the
taxes paid, in which event it will in
volve no cost to the citizens.
The committee decided to allow the
Health Board $650 additional to the $2000
already appropriated for cleansing
Chinatown under the supervision of the
special committee of Supervisors. The
clerk was directed to apply to the Civil
Service Commission for six laborers to
do the work.. They are to report at 8
o'clock this morning to Dr. Hassler, at
Clay and Dupont streets. The com
mittee informed Dr. Blue of the United
States marine hospital service that he
has the authority to discharge any man
not properly doing his work.
John Partridge, president of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, which has been given tem
porary charge of the public pound, in
formed the committee that the society
would be put to considerable expense
in obtaining horses and wagons, and
it did not desire to assume the
obligation unless it would have conj
trol of the pound for some stated pe^
riod. Thereupon it was decided that
the clerk be directed to invite state
ments from humane societies in this
city as to their ability to take charge
of the pound, the facilities they have
and under what conditions they would
accept the control of the institution.
Tax Collector Smith appeared before
the committee and stated that he would
require $6000 additional for extra clerks
during the remainder of the fiscal year.
The extra amount Is required because
the State Board of Equalization had

for ?2000 for additional help, but the
committee postponed action on both
requests.
At the request of Assistant Chief En
gineer Dougherty the committee or
dered an appropriation of $150 tp pur
chase 150 wooden frames for holding

Attorney Coghlan has been making a
strong effort to obtain a new trial for
Sullivan, and as a last resort filed the
Powell affidavit yesterday afternoon. In
it' Powell declares that he flred the
shots into Sample's body in self-de
fense, believing that if he had not done
so he would have been killed or
sustained great bodily injury; that Sul
livan did. not fire any of the shots and
was not even present at the time.
Powell further says that he did not say
to any person that he had fired the
shots till af^er the trial and conviction
of Sullivan of murder in the second de
gree. \
An affidavit' was also filed by Sullivan
denying that he had flred the shots and
stating that he did not know till Janu
ary 15 that Powell was willing to go on
the stand and testify that he had killed
Sample in self-defense.
After the affidavits were filed the
Judge continued the matter of the mo
tion for a new trial in the Sullivan case
till, Saturday. Powell was asked if he
had any legal cause to show why sen
tence should not be passed upon him,
and Coghlan answered in the negative.
The Judge said he would postpone sen
tence till Saturday, when Assistant
District Attorney Ferral would be pres
ent, but Coghlan insisted upon sen
tence being pronounced at once. The
Judge, however, postponed sentence un
til Saturday.
On the charge of murder In the sec
ond degree Sullivan could get Imprison
ment for . life, but on the charge of
manslaughter Powell cannot get more
than ten years. *
It was shown at both trials .that Sul
livan and Powell had been fighting
with some other men; that Sample
told them to go home; that they walked
along till about half-way on the block
on Folsom street between Second and
Third, where they stood in a
doorway; that Sample, who had fol
lowed them, came up to them and three
shots were, fired:' into Sample's, body.
Sample in his dying statement declared
that Powell had struck him, that Sulli
van had knocked him down and while
on the ground Sullivan had taken Sam
ple's revolver out of his pocket and
flred the three shots at Sample. They
were both arrested while running away
from the scene of the shooting.
Something of a sensation was caused
in Judge Lawlor's court yesterday,
when Charles Sullivan and John H.
Powell appeared for sentence. Sullivan
on a charge of murder in the second
degree and Powell on a charge of man
slaughter. Attorney N. C. Coghlan filed
an affidavit by Powell taking upon him
self the whole blame for the killing of
Special Officer. Robert A. Sample on
Folsom street, between First and Sec
ond, on the morning of August 11, and
exonerating Sullivan. ,

Hard Lack of German Editor.
German papers must not deal with .
army affairs in a spirt of irony. A '
lieutenant in Halle was sentenced to
fourteen days' imprisonment for
thrashing his orderly. A socialistic
paper commented on the fact in a
facetious manner. What was to be
come of the army and its officers if a
lieutenant had to suffer disgrace be
cause he beat his orderly? The edi
tor sot six weeks.
One New York young woman â it is
perhaps needless to specify her col
lege â exploits the theory that if
"Hamlet" had been the matinee at
Chicago' instead of an extravaganza
the life loss would have been small.
Her argument is that a "Hamlet"
crowd is a reasoning one, not to be
stampeded by even the most trying
circumstances, and of the Iroquois
would have got itself out in an orderly
nianner. There is perhaps something
in this claim that the life loss at a
"Hamlet" matinee would have been
smaller than at "Bluebeard," but for
reasons different from those put for
ward by the college young woman:
the attendance might have been 200;
it certainly would not have been 2000.

All went well with the brand new
black official until a captain }n the
navy. Count Bernsdorff. passed that
way.. His eye fell on the gentleman of
color, whose appearance seemed to
shock him. The Count is one of the
strongest advocates of the well known
patriotic cry, "Germany for the Ger
mans'." He immediately registered
a formal protest against the presence
there, in the German uniform, of the
ever-smiling darky. He called for his
dismissal. "No Government official
had a right to be black," wrote he. â

The color question, whicfl, I be
lieve, has not hitherto been raised in
Germany, comes ud in the following
manner. Of late passengers from the
Potsdamer Bahnhof have been not a
little surprised to see a very highly
polished negro, decked in a brand
new uniform (brass buttons complete)
of a railroad company. Passengers
viewed this gentleman of color with
mingled feeling?, according to their
humors. , The ladies seemed to ad
mire him,' the children were amused,
the men said "Donnerwetter!" Poli
ticians asked, "Is this the- advance
guard of the American danger?" And
the negro smiled good-naturedly and
with impartiality upon all of them.

The great public interest In that
newest and most romantic of the ele
ments, radium was shown by the
crowded audience assembled at the
Camera Club recently to hear a lec
ture by T. C. Porter, science master at
Eton, on the subject.
Mr. Porter showed in a delightfully
concise and simple "manner how fun
damentally our conception of the
atomic structure of the universe has
been changed by recent scientific in
vestigations. Beginning with Dal
ton's conception of an ultimate indi
visable atom, and an impassable gulf
between element and element, he went
on to sketch the investigations of Pro- â¢
fessor J. J. Thomson as to the cath
ode rays in a Crookes tube, and the
reasons for assuming them to be neg
atively charged particles or electrons
a. thousand times smaller than the
atom, shot out from it with velocity
comparable with that of light.
Roentgen's discovery of the rays set
in motion by these particles, the find
ing of similar waves emitted by ura
nium by M. Becquexeh the isolation of
the still more active radium by M. anil
Mme. Curie, and Rutherford ami Sod
dy's experiments as to the breakdown
by successive stages of thorium and
radium, were in turn dealt with. Mr.
Porter then showed how not only ra
dium, but in a less degree many of the
common substances of dally life, were
composed of atoms gradually breaking
down by the emission of electrons into
less active substances, finally coming
to such elements as helium, xenon,
krypton, argon and neon, whose "bach
elor atoms" had no apparent affinity
for anything. The great theory which
seemed to be dawning was that of the
unity of the basis of all matter, a com
mon substance of which the ele/ments
were but visible forms.
The "bombardment" of radium elec
trons on a blende screen was shown in
a tube, and Mr. Martin Duncan showed
slides of the effect on a photographic
plate of a radio-active mineral.â Lon-^

One effect of Mr. "Williams' visit has
been that a perfect understanding has
been reached as to the relations which
shall exist between the tracks con
trolled by him and that of the local as
sociation. %Vhen the Ascot associa
tion was formed Williams was thought
to be unfriendly to it, but his present
trip to Los Angeles has removed what
ever friction there may have existed
and both tracks being members of the
same general association the rulings
upon one will be respected upon the
other. , -^ ..
It has been publicly announced that
Mr. Williams' visit was purely social,
a visit which any racing magnate
might pay to any new track and that
it had no significance, but to-night cer
tain directors of the Ascot Park cor
poration admitted he had hoped to se
cure all or a portion of the stock owned
by the late John A. Muir. He did not
secure that or any other stock in the
association. ..
LOS 'ANGELES, Jan. 20.â President
T. H. Williams of the New California
Jockey Club came here two days ago
accompanied by a legal adviser, and
from inquiries made . bj| him It was
thought he was desirous of securing
a financial interest in the new Ascot
Park racetrack.
He left to-night on the owl train for
San Francisco without having accom
plished his . purpose, if that was his
pumose, for he found the Ascot asso
ciation a close , corporation . with the
stock in such hands that he could not
secure a sufficient numoer of shares
to enable him to be a factor in its busi
ness. . -

An effort will be made to haw the
"amateur" clul>s promote their exhi
bitions in their own gymnasiums here
after, as the city boxing ordinance re
cjuires. The management of clubs hav
iag gymnasiums object to their rivals
having the advantage of the larger
audiloriurr, where the receipts war
rant $300 purses, while the rules allow
only ?35 trophies.
Touns Corbett is anxious to make a
match with Dave Sullivan for Febru
ary. H* does not think it will inter
fere â¢with his engagement with Britt.
It is th*Â» gossip among sporting resorts
that Britt and Corbett are each to re
ceive a bonus of 10 per cent of tho
pross receipts of their fight. This runs
the total purse up to 85 per cent, which
Leaves but little profit for the promot
ing club.

Alaraeda. He wiJl not go at it hard, as
all he needs is to get his breathing ap
paratus in good nrdor. Broad, who

condition. The m<Â»n are to meet at
catch weight?, so there will be no trou-
Me on that score.

Tor this city to-day. He has fought all
the featherweights of prominence dur
ing the past five years. The list in
cludes Young Corbett, Terry McGovern,

Garnet Ferguson's colt Military
Man was installed a pronounced fa
vorite over Formaster, to win the clos
ing seven furlong event, and failed.
The first choice was not able to out
fo6t Red Cross Nurse, though event
ually running third. After beingvcar
ried out by Rt_ Tu Brute, Otto Won
derly lost no time in getting to the
front with Formaster, winning by
nearly four lengths from Dungannon,
a 20 to 1 shot. ,.
NOTES OF. THE TRACK.
- Perhaps Claude cannot beat Fossil
in foggy weather, but Mike Daly's
Derby winner Â«can take the little
brown horse into camp over a moder
ately heavy track, as was amply ex
emplified in the Owners' handicap
yesterday at Oakland.
Each had a "catch" up, Claude car
rying 80 and Fossil flve pounds more,
Hildebrand, though, rode Fossil, and
at 3 to 5 the Washington "and Oregon
delegation unlimbered. Those first in
line received 6 to 1 against Claude, the
laggards who did not believe in the
'early bird story 'taking 4 and i\i.
Faulconbridge, the only other start
er, was so well thought of that only
4 was chalked about him. Hildebrand
went out in the lead at the start with
the favorite. Just after passing the
half-mile post 'Willie Daly, who had
taken Claude back once to get out on
the dryer going, made his .bid and the
race was over. Claude ttfbk the lead
without effort and won eased almost
to a walk in 1:41%. Faulconbridge
was never dangerous.
CHOICES FAII; TO L.AXD.
Not a favorite landed first money.
Sugden, Henry Ach, Nervator, Fossil,
Chickadee and Military Man all going
down to defeat. Most of the winners,
however, were well supported In the
ring.
Charley McCafferty'R Flaneur start
ed in a race on Tuesday and finished
last. The gelding came out again in
the opening event at Oakland yester
day and, backed from 4 to 3 to 1, won
all the way. Optimo showed an im
provement in form, nosing out Sugden
for the place. The latter was favor
ite and Bell put up a most listless
ride. .
Peggy O'Xeil, from Bob Smith's
stable, with Larsen in the saddle, was
well played to beat Henry Ach for the
two-year-old scramble, and the filly
accomplished the - feat. Barney
Schreiber's colt had no excuses for his
downfall. Tommy Burns got him away
in front, and he led to the -paddock.
There he ehowed signs of faltering
and the filly passed him on the inside,
winning by half a length in :42!Â£.
Golden Idol ran a fair third, three
lengths before Gloomy Gus,
UAIXAULiT BY* A HEAD.
There was an awful scramble to get
aboard Nervator, which" was" played
down to favoritism in the betting on
thfc six and a half furlong run. It"was
probably not sloppy enough for the
Foots and Hollenbeck sprinter, as he
ran up to third position and could. not
better it. Kunz took Hainault, the
second choice, out in front and, suc
cessfully resisting the .^challenge of
Hildebrand on Muresca. earned a head
decision at the wire. Albemarle was a.
starter and ran a miserable race.
Chickadee, another one from the
McCafferty stable, carried the smart
money to land the mile and a quarter
selling number, but fell short just one
position. Byronerdale, a 7 to 1 out
sider, piloted by Kunz, headed Lapidus
before a mile had been traveled, and,
holding Chickadee safe the last eighth,
crossed the line a couple of lengths to
the good. Expedient flhished an ordi
nary third.

promptly in cases of chronic dyspepsia, indigestion and all stomach troubles,

drowsiness and dizziness that so often come after eating.
S. S. S. is not only the best tonic but possesses alterative or purifying
properties, and if there is any taint, humor or poison in the blood \ it
searches it out, and removes it. Many times a low state of. health is due
to a bad condition of the blood and can only be remedied by a blood purifier

If you suffer from* debility, insomnia, nervousness, . loss of appetite,

Damages for Leakage.
Oriental trickery in a new phase was
developed yesterday in the trial of a
habeas corpus case before United
States Court Commissioner Heacock.
It would appear from the revelations
mad* that Chinese blackmailers make
use of the courts and the exclusion act
to further thoir own nefarious ends,
and that an organized gang exists In
this city, the members of which force
tribute from Chinese laborers born in
the I'nitrd States and returning from
a visit to China.
"Pay us or you can't land" is their
motto. The case referred to is that of
Gee King Yung, who alleged that he
was bom in San Francisco on October
t4. 1?T^; that he went to China with his
father in 1877 and returned to this city
in 1W. On that occasion his landing
was secwred by means of affidavits by
Gee Git Dick and Gee Pong Chong,
who swore that they had visited the
boy and his father fourteen years pre
viously in China and therefore identi
fied the Â«ad as G*>e Bing Tung, the
nephew of G<^ Git Dick. In 1901 Gee
King Yung went to China again and
returned a few days apo, when Gee Git
Dick and Gee Pong ChonR appeared
before the Chinee Bureau and swore
that the testimony that they had given
in 1K&7 was false and that they in truth
had not seen Gee Bing Tung in China.
The bureau thereupon refused to allow
him to land, and the case was taken
before Commissioner Heacock on a
habeas corpus proceeding.
The matter came up yesterday, but
neither C-ee Git Dick nor Gee Pong
Chong appeared. In their stead was
another Chinaman, a stranger in the
ca*e. who cheerfully swore that he had
met the applicant and his father many
times in <*hfna and knew the young
man to be the person he represented
himself to be.
Judge Heacock was uncertain wheth
er the two perjurers who appeared be
fore the Chinese Bureau had told the
truth on the first or on the second oc
casion. Finally the court remarked
that the case was covered with slime. .
and that Gee Git Dick and Gee Pong
Chong had sworn that they were liars
and unworthy of belief. He therefore
orderfd that the applicant be remand
ed intrÂ» the custody of the steamship
officials to be returned to China.
The applicant's counsel explained to
the c-nurt that he had been informed
that the two perjurers had had a quar
rel with the applicant's father because
he had refused to vote for their friend
at a tong- election, and had taken their ,
revenge by causing the son to be ex
cluded.
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 20.â The price
for cotton futures to-day reached the
highest point since the war. At the
highest levels of the day new records
for the season and for the period since
war times were established. â¢ .
This comparison, which agitated
"shorts" yesterday, stirred them to ex
cited activity to-day, but the best they
could do for the most part was to
shift the burden among themselves.
Nothing that looked like Armour sell
ing could be discovered. On the other
hand, considerable commission house
buying was credited to the paramount
Interest. Private messages received
here to-day indicate that a consid
erable quantity of the "short" wheat
on the Armour books was put out by
Eastern peoples-
May corn and May oats, control of
which is generally thought to be close
ly centralized, also advanced sharply
to-day.
CHICAGO, Jan. 20.â May wheat
pouched a new high. markâ 92%Â®92%câ
[ to-day, a net gain for the day of 2ViC
; and 16c higher thar/ the average price
j last fall. The local wheat situation as
j regards prices is highly artificial, as
i is shown by the character of the trade
which caused so sharp a gain In prices.
Armour is credited with a "long" line
! of 15.000,000 bushels contracted for May
delivery. Local contract stocks ap
| proximate only 2,000,000 bushels.

Russian exporters are bitter in the
complaints against ; the mismanage
ment of the Siberian railway. The
rolling-stock is totally inadequate,. and
the great delays due to this feature
and to the numerous breakdowns
have inflicted great losses on mer
chants using the railway. The Man
churian railway. will accept no respon
sibility for loss due to accident or de
lay. Several lots of tea were three
months in their' way across Asia.â -

An amusing story is told of "Uncle
Dick" Ogleby. once" Governor of Illi
nois.- He made a tour of inspection
of the Joliet prison, and came to a
cell in which a" hideously ugly man
was eonOned. The man was so ill
favored that the Governor stopped to
ask about him.
'-. : ''What's he in for?"- - .
"He forced a young woman to elope
with" him at. the point of a pistol," the
keeper replied. . \ ;
>^- Well." $ald Qglesby, "I guess I'll
pardon him/'
"Pardon him!" protested the^War
den. "Why,! Governor, the proof
against hini is. absolute."
"I know." said the Governor, "but
he couldn't get her to marry. him in
any other waj^"
fere with them. But when the Hotten
tst is once fully aroused It, Js ; difflcult to
restrain him. and the landfulof Eng
lishmen : in ' the country may yet suffer.

London's campaign against the dock
rats has progressed satisfactorily. Ac
cording: to the official reports of the
rat killers, over 5000 of the rodents
have been killed every month of the
past year. Since the bubonic scare
roused the authorities, to action not
loss than a quarter^* a million. rats
have been killed. The gain has been
great, not only, from the health point
of view, but in the savins of property.
The destructive capacity of the Lon
don wharf rat is very large, individual
ly and collectively. â Xew York Com

.GET DESIRED INCREASE
He bezan his railroad experience
sixty-three years ago in the freight
office of the Connecticut River Rail
road at Northampton. A few years
later he was made ticket agent at
Holyoke. then a small town that had
not begun to feel the impetus of the
water power development 'which later
made It the largest center of writing
paper manufacture in the world.
For more than half a century Mr.
Ward sold tickets to Holyoke resi
dents, being one of only a few ticket
agents retained when the Boston and
Maine Railroad leased the Connecticut
niver Railroad ten years ago. Two
stations were abandoned, but the
ticket office was not deserted by Mr.
Ward, whose broad shoulders and pa
triarchal beard are familiar to, al
most every resident of Holyoke, as"
well as thousands of occasional visit
ors to the city. In fact. Mr. Ward Is
said to be the best known citizen in
Holyoke.
At the time of his retirement he
was the oldest ticket agent on the
Boston and Maine system In point of
years of service, and j perhaps the
oldest in the United States in a city of
the size of Holyoke. â New York Com
mercial.
Fifty years of selling tickets at a
bustling railroad station is beyond the
endurance of the nerves of the /aver
age person. One of a few men to
accomplish the feat is \V. W. Ward of
Holyoke, Mass.. who retired with the
beginning: of the new year.

COMMERCIAL NEWS
It had/its origin in a Bond-street tea
shop, where a party of five ladies dis
cussed the hated word, and resolved to
form into a committee to
devise some, drastic means of stamping
it out. ' '
It was at first suggested that an
"Anti-Spinster Crusade" should be or
â¢ganized." This was, however, aban
doned on the ground that to beÂ«"antl"
anything was an indication of "cranky
ism." All .agreed that the term spin
ster was distinctly unfair jf not abso
lutely libelous, and that its application
branded air unmarried ladies^ as old
maids.' â¢ "Bachelor" was elegant when
compared with, "spinster," it was con
tended. And then the promoter of the
movement had a brilliant inspiration.
"Why not form a lady bachelors*
club?" she asked.
The ladies reasoned that such a. club
would provide a kind of passive resist
ance to the word they abhorred.
The question of a club having been
decided, it was resolved that its object
should be mainly to remove the word'
"spinster" from all dictionaries; and
one lady hinted that she had influence
in high quarters sufficient to prevent
the use of "that horrible word" upon
census returns and other official docu
ments. V\JT.' -
The following general principles of
management were then agreed upon:
That the members of the club shall
consist of girls who are not single by
reason of the fact that they have never
received a proposal: girls who have
never had the opportunity of rejecting
an offer of . marriage; and engaged
girls. . 0
That when a member of the club is
married no fine be imposed.
That such bride should, however,
ceaee to be a member of the club. â To
ronto Mail.
The abolition of the word '/spinster,"
as applied to unmarried women of. all
ages, is the sole object of a society
which has jiist'been formed.
One word about the English; in Sud-
West. Their ; number is^ not large, "and
they are Â«chiefly in the Keetmanshoop
district. There is no. bad< feeling be
tween them and the Hottentots, and
the care .taken by" the rebels to < avoid
injuring them proves \ a " fixed policy, on
the part of the Hottentots not to intcr-
The troopsâ 1000 or soâ era scattered
far and wide in ones and twos, lind
very few posts number mory. than
twenty men. Concentration would be
very difficult and lengthy. \' The dis
tance from "Windhoek (whence the 1000
rifles will, march) to Warmbad is 450
miles, and water is scarce <along the
road so that the relieving force, which
must largely consist of olunteers, will
take at least a fortnight to reacl "the
scene of action, for the only railway in
the colony runs from the port of Swak
opmund to Windhoek, the - capital.
Much ma^ happen in that time.
The troops will march through Reho
both. Gibeon and Keetmanshoop,** the
last being the chief, administrative cen
ter of the south, and a small -town,
whose danger must be considerable; as
it is only .about 100 miles north of
Warmbad. >
- It is to be hoped . that" the , German
advance' wilh be ; swift and successful.
The Bastards and possibly . the- Wit
boois, caÂ« / be relied on, and with their
help the Germans and Dutchmen may
possibly get down south in time to
avert a terrible disaster/. V
Sud-West, as the colony is generally
called, I3 a country of magnificent dis
tances (its area is about 280,000 square
miles), and 'much of it is practically
desert. Along the whole coast (some
800 miles) and for about 100 miles in
land It is a howling wildernessâ first of
sand and then of stones.
Within this belt the country improves
somewhat, but the -continued droughts
are a sore trial to t farmers. The fertile
areas are" generally dried up. The coun
try in the southern half of the colony
is t covered with scrub, and H wide
stretches of undulating country alter
nate with high ridges. It is a country
adapted to guerrilla warfare* . V
SCATTERED TROOPS/ '
The pure Bushmen are probably the
lowest type of human beings in the
world. Queer little, undersized, ner
vously grinning blacks, they cannot be
tamed,, and now are approaching ex
tinction. Traces of their paintings are
found even in'Basutoland, but German
Southwest Africa is to-day their last
home. They live now, as they always
did, widely scattered. Thefr language
is practically a succession of clicks, and
as a rule their intellects cannot grasp
any number higher than five. Anything
beyond that is "a. great many."
The Bushman has apparently no
moral sense. He will live where even a
Hottentot will starve, and as a hunter
he is hard to beat. He will follow a
buck until it drops from exhaustion,
and his poisoned arrows are things to
be avoided.
Their cunning is proverbial, and as
trackers of game they rank high. Un
fortunately, they are cursed with a glo
rious past. - . . '.:Â¦Â¦; , f â¢ .
Hendrik Witbooi, 'chief of th> Witbooi
Hottentots, was-for years the terror of
all the tribes of the southern parts. He
finally quarreled with the Germans and
fought them for three years with won
derful skill, using guerrilla tactics, and
finally surrendering on honorable
terms. He is now a pensioner of the
Germans and is believed to be loyal.'
But the Hottentots generally have
never forgotten the good fight he made.
They have never been thoroughly and
properly thrashed, and as the Germans
have allowed the chiefs to retain some
authority over their tribes, there is a
strong clan serttiment. The execution
of a chief might well bring discontent
to a head, and it is not impossible that
they may consider the Germans re
sponsible for the drought.
PUKE BUSHMEX.
. The Hottentots are of various clans
scattered about, chiefly in the southern
half of the colonyl' They are usually
small and yellow-skinned, and their
wool grows in patches. Their language
consists largely of clicks and gurgles,
and is not pleasant t<j listen to.
They are lazy, treacherous, thievish
and untruthful. Theyywork when they
cannot help it, and when there is Si
chance of hunting off they go and leave
their employer in. the lurch. They will
live where a white man would starve,
and find water where he would die of
thirst.
VARIOUS CLAXS.
Besides the half-caste tribÂ£ called
Bastards, there are Herreros; Damaras,
Ovampos, Hottentots and Bushmen.
The Herreros, Damaras arrU Ovarapoa
are of the same blood as the -Zulus,
Basutos and Cape Kafirs." The former
two, who live chiefly in the N central
zone, have given little trouble to the
Germans, but the Ovampos, who live in
the far north, are still unconquered and
are defiant and insolent to the Ger
mans, who for several years past have
planned expeditions which so far have
had to be postponed. The Ovampos, if.
fully mustered, could show 14,000 fight-
Ing men, some of them armed with
rifles. Thus there is a threatening
cloud in the north.
The bad news from German South
west Africa introduces to notice a ter
ritory seldom heard of. Before 1883
the colony was a sort of no-man's-land,
having:, besides a population of about
250,000 natives, a sprinkling of English,
Germans and Dutch, the last-najned the
most numerous, who shot big game,
traded with the natives and raised
stock. There was some supervision
from Cape Town, but very little.
In 1883 Luderitz, a German, purchased
a concession in the. south from a Hot
tentot chief, and .as the Cape Govern
ment did not care to undertake perm
anent responsibilities in that part of
the world Prince Bismarck declared a
protectorate over the whole territory
between Cape Colony and Portuguese
West Africa, and the German flag was
hoisted at,Angra Pequena in* 1884.

I FRESH FROM THE GARDEN.
J5 . . Very appetizing will be the next picture presented to Sunday Call
j0>. ' readers. It is an example of still IJfe and is called "Fresh From the Gar-
i$ ' Â¦ den," being a beautiful reproduction in colors of the famous painting by
x . '.' the eminent French artist, Louis dc Sehryver.
â¢CÂ» The composition is a delight in its originality and appetizing charac-
ter.- One might readily' imagine it as a daiuty surprise prepared for the
ij onlooker by- some loving hand, the portrayal being absolute In its realism.
P One feels almost like picking up the berries individually and putting them
jOi . fn the mouth, so true to nature are they pictured. ;
* Dc Sehryver has surpassed himself in this particular canvas. He is
rt not usually given to representing > st ill life. He is better known to the
Q *â¢ world cf ait as a painter of street scenes peopled by the figures of well-
Â£ gowned Parisian women. He is, however, a great artist, as this picture to
Â§ be given away to Sunday Call readers next Sunday demonstrates.
O .He/ is Parisian born, a celebrated exhibitor in the salon in '86 and
S- for years following. He won a second class medal In '91 and first class
Â£â¢"- - in "90. He is still a young and promising artist, being on the sunny side
Â£ of 50. The probabilities are that g reater honors are reserved for him
i? N as he steadily progresses.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Tee Government has increased Its ordÂ«r fcr
Hay ca this sarket 25 per ceat. thereby

"The large orders placed en this market by

cuiries from Southern California, are still
coming In. and it looks as if a good trade
m!Â«ht be developed la that portion cf tae
State before the end of the rresest s*-ascn.

MONTGOMERY'S DUTIES
HAVE BEEN MULTIPLIED
As to the extent of the endurance of
the salt warriors it is reported that
the Amalgamated Salt Company has on
hand something like 100,000 tons of salt
and that the Imperial Company has
remaining of the old Mission Rock sup
ply about 30,000 tons. Thls^ is all going
at prices that will enable the fish deal
ers and others who have to use large
auantities of salt to lay in at least a
season's supply at a rate that is sure
to net a profit at some future time when
the agreement is again perfected and
the consideration soars accordingly.
When the case against the Federal
Salt Company, known as tne trust, was
in the Federal courts some time ago
parties who were identified with that
company formed the Imperial Com
pany. For a time after the adverse
decision in the Federal court there was
harmony. The Imperial Company, per
haps not in name, but in fact, had in
terests identical with those of the
Amalgamated Company, so the salt
men say. The old magnates of the Fed
eral Salt Company, going to the Im
perial, tried, so say the people of the
Amalgamated Company, to control
everything. This caused dissatisfac
tion *in the Amalgamated Company's
camp and ultimately led to open war
and the present condition of the mar
ket. . .
One example shows the extent to
which the warring salt men have gone.
A cargo of salt was brought from Mex
ico. The market in the north had some
of this salt. That which was sold in
San Francisco is reported to have cost
$3 per ton, including duty, freight and
al! charges. It was put out at a rate
of $1 50 per ton. The parties who
brought it from Mexico lost heavily.
Whether this costly experiment will
be repeated is a question.
The greatest fight in the history of
the salt trade on the Pacific Coast Is
now at its height. Conflicting interests
are warring for the control of the maf
ket. On one side is what is left of the
old combination known as the Federal
Salt Trust. The name of this remnant
is known as the Imperial Salt Company.
On the other side is the Amalgamated
Salt Company, which includes in its
membership the owners of many salt
works around the bay of San Francisco.
The battle has not been raging long,
but it has been hot from the outset.
Its intensity may be judged from the
Btriking fact that the market price for
salt has fallen so low by reason of the
war that no more quotations are made
in the open. The extreme has been

Robert E. Montgomery, chief clerk
to the manager of the Southern Pa
cific Company, was yesterday assigned
to the work heretofore performed by
X. H. Foster, manager's assistant, who
resigned several days ago. It was
stated by Manager Agler that the po
sition of manager's assistant had been
abolished and that Montgomery would
retain his title of chief clerk, although
his duties -tvould be greater.
Montgomery has been with the
Southern Pacific Company for many
years. He served as chief clerk un
der the late Manager J. A. Fillmore
and is regarded as a very capable man
and is exceedingly popular among the
officials of the company. / '

Pawnbrokers' Ordinance Valid.
By sustaining a demurrer yesterday
to the suit brought by J. L. Schimmel.
a pawnbroker, for an injunction pre
venting the city officials from enforc
ing an ordinance passed by the Super
visors last January, Judge Murasky
practically decided that the ordinance
was a valid one and that its provisions
violated the constitutional rights of no
one. The ordinance in question pro
vided that all pawnbrokers shall, at
10 a. m. each day, furnish the Chief of
Police with a list of all articles pledged
with them, the name of the pledgor
and his or her description and resi
dence. The ordinance further provides
that all articles so listed shall be held
for a period of eight days in order that
the efforts of the police to locate stolen
goods shall not be balked.

John P. Gallagher, formerly pro
prietor of the Langham Hotel, won' a
suit against the Equitable Gas Light
Company yesterday in the Supreme
Court. Gallagher was using elec
tricity in his hostelry, but yielded to
the persuasions of a representative of
the illumination company to substi
tute gas. He was informed that the
rate would be 65 cents a thousand
feel. At considerable expense he put
in new fixtures.
Everything ran along smoothly for
about four months and then the com
pany wanted to give Gallagher his
gas at the rate of $1 for a thousand
feet. He paid under protest, because
he had to have illumination for such
of his guests as did not retire at sun
down, and commenced a lawsuit.
The Supreme Court reverses the
lower tribunal and declares that the
plaintiff should have his gas for 65
cents a thousand feet during the life
of the contract.
Emma C. Baker did battle with the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany and came off second best. The
Supreme Court says that she did not
comply with the letter of the law and
hence the judgment must go against
her. Mrs. Baker lived at 124 Fulton
street. She paid $5 in advance for
gas and subsequently moved to 301
Grove street, owing the company $3 85
for the monoxide burned at the first
named address. At her new home she
ran up a bill of $2 45 for gas. She
offered to pay the company the $2 45
and told an agent to deduct the $3 85
from the 55 originally advanced. The
company refused to entertain this
proposition, her gas was shut off and
she brought suit for damages.
The Supreme Court decides' that her
offer to pay the two bills was not
sufficient and says that she should
have deposited the money In a bank
to the credit of the concern.

An inqu^?t was lifid yesterday on
the body of Robert Reavbdde of 618
Ellis street, who was killed on Janu- j
ary 13 by boing struck by a street j
car. A verdict of accident was re- j
turned, wilh the following addition:
"The jury agree that death was due
to lack of jiropor precaution on the
jÂ»art of the moiorman in running the
cp.r nt too high a speed in crossing
Hyde street at Turk, he having been
struck at th? westerly crossing."
that they paid the producer the least
possible price for his goods and sold
them to the merchants. They in turn
sold the wares to the consumer, who
was forced to pay an unreasonably
high price.
Webb, continuing, said that the com
mission men agreed to live up to all
the provisions of the Woodward law
when they were granted their permits.
Instead of doing so Webb insinuated
that they immediately began to violate
their privileges in every instance and
disobeyed all the provisions of the law.
He said that when the commission men
were granted their permits they agreed
to allow the Harbor Commissioners to
be the judges as to whether or not they
were living up to the agreement. He
contended that they consented to allow
the commissioners to call for an in
vestigation when that body saw fit and
that If in the opinion of the board the
permits should be revoked they would
consent.
Webb said that if the board ordered
an investigation and the commission
men refused to testify or bring wit
nesses to testify in their behalf it was
within the power of the board to re
voke the permits of the firms. Mc-
Enerney interrupted Webb on several
occasions to inquire into details regard
ing minor incidents.
The Judge adjourned court when
Webb was in the midst of his speech.
The case will be resumed this morning
at 10 o'clock, when Webb will conclude
his argument, and McEnerney will then
make the closing .speech, after which
the case will be taken under advisement
by Judge Sloss.
The arguments in the suit of Wet
more Bros., commission .merchants,
against the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners for an . injunction re
straining the board from revoking the
permit of the firm to do business on
State property on the water front came
up in Superior Judgp Sloss' court yes
terday morning. The Judge has al
ready granted the commission men a
restraining order, and the present is
sue at stake is to decide whether or
not their permit shall be permanently
withdrawn.
The Harbor Commissioners were rep
resented by Attorney General Webb
and Judge Davis and Attorneys Garret
McEnerney and J. B. Reinsteln ap
peared for Wetmore Bros. The entire
day was taken up with the arguments
of the attorneys, and while Attorney
General Webb was still in the midst
of his discourse Judge Sloss adjourned
the case. It will be resumed this morn
ing at 10 o'clock.
The morning session was given over
to the arguments of Attorney Rein
stein and Judge Davis. When the case
was calledi Reinstein began his argu
ment, which lasted for nearly two
hours. He tried to show that the Har
bor Commissioners acted . illegally in
revoking the permit of Wetmore Bros.,
and ' cited several reasons to substan
tiate his claims.
Reinstein stated that the Harbor
Commissioners were at fault in sev
eral instances when they revoked the
permit of Wetmore Bros. He said that
no specific charges were filed, and that
therefore, according to law, the Com
missioners had no right to revoke the
permits. He also insinuated that the
firm had not been notified directly that
its permit had been revoked, and this
in itself was illegal.
FIR 31 NOT NOTIFIED.
According to Relnstein, the Harbor
Commissioners' only notified the sec
retary of the firm when the permit was
taken away and failed to acquaint the
members of the action. He also claimed
that due notice was not served on the
firm requesting them to appear before
the Commissioners on December 3 last,
as required by law.
As to the speciflo charges not being
mentioned, Reinsteln spoke at length.
He stated that the charges were filed
as a whole and that in the entire com
plaint nol one specific charge of where
the firm had violated its permit was
brought out. Reinstein asked the
Judge to pay particular attention to
that phase of the case and added that
in his opinion It proved conclusively
thRt the board was in error when it
revoked the permit of Wetmore Bros.
Heinatein was followed by Judge Da
vis, who, delivered a long and tedious
address to the court regarding the
statutes and legal points of the case.
According to Davis, the various com
mission merchants, including the firm
of Wetmore Bros., had combined to
fight the Harbor Commissioners and
they would leave nothing undone to
win their point, no matter whether the
board was in the right or not..
Davis contended that the board had
acted strictly within the requirements
of the law when it revoked the permit
of Wetmore Bros. Davis tried to show
that the commission men had violated
the law time and time again and that
this was shown at the Investigation
held on December 3.
AGREEMENT IS VIOLATED.
Judge Davis added that it was not
necessary for a specific charge to be
made, as the evidence at the inquiry in
stituted by the board showed conclu
sively that Wetmore Bros, and the
other firms violated their agreement
with the board and when their permits
were revoked the board acted strictly
within, the law, as it had ample evi
dence to show that the commission
men were not living up. to their agree
ment.
Davis was frequently interrupted by
Attorney McEnerney, who wanted to
know why specific charges were not
made against the firms and why the
board refused to go into details when
the charges were filed. Davis replied
that it was not necessary, as the board
had evidence, enough In its possession
to show that' the firms had violated
their agreements without mentioning
specific cases.
Davis, went on to say that the com
mission men discriminated against cer
tain buyers at every opportunity and
that this was in direct violation of th<Â«ir
agreement and good cause on which to
revoke their permits. He also inti
mated that there was not enough evi
dence on which to grant the commis
sion men an injunction. The commis
sion men, he claimed, sought to show
that their business was being willfully
injured by the board, but added that
they failed to show any instance of this.
Attorney General Webb began his ar
gument when Davis had finished." The
Attorney General began by reviewing
the case and telling just why the Wood
ward act was passed. He stated that
the act became a law with the under
standing that it was to be a benefit to
the producer, commission man and
consumer.
Accordins to Webb the commission
men were the only; ones who profited
by the law. * He tried to show that as
soon as it went into effect the middle-,
men combined for their own benefit;
. J.' Walter Laymance, the Oakland
real estate dealer, who claims that o,
woman of the name of Maude Law
rence forged his name to three checks
aggregating in value $250 and cashed
the same, with the Columbian Banking
Company, spent an entirely uncomfort
able hour and r a half on the witness
stand in Judge Cabaniss' court yester
day. It was the continuance of his
cross-examination, and the grilling he
got from the defendant's attorney
Monday did not seem to enlighten him
that for a man in Jiis position the saf
est course was to let his words be
"Yea, yea and nay, nay."
It was drawn from him by force that
on December 31 he received from the
bank a bundle of his checks which had
been cashed by that institution.
Among them were three made payable
to bearer and on the back of each was
indorsed the signature "M. Lawrence."
One of these was for $10 and he admit
ted having given that to Miss Law
rence in order that she might pay her
room rert at the Bay State lodging
house on Stockton street. But the
other two checks he found to be forger
ies and he Illustrated the dramatic
manner In which he told his stenogra
pher of the discovery. The defendant's
attorney had a lot of fun making him
go through the motions until the court
checked the' proceedings.
Laymance testified ! that he was not
certain at the time who the forger was,
although he had an admittedly genuine
check and two alleged forgeries all in
dorsed in the same handwriting by
,"M. Lawrence." "When he took them
to the Dank he said he told the presi
dent of the institution that two of the
checks were forged, but refused to
have the alleged forger arrested for
fear t^hat he might be doing some one
an injustice. At that time he said he
had only "suspicions" regarding the
identity of the alleged forger. He
claims to have told President Swift of
the bank that he wanted to "give the
calf more rope" and that probably an
other check would come in that would
fix the guilt positively.
Laymance was a picture of/ uneasi
ness during his examination. He
squirmed and ground around the chair,
twisting his hands convulsively, and Â°t
nearly every other t question he at
tempted to make a confidant of the
Judge until he had to be admonished
that the hearing was public and that
the defendant and her attorney were
entitled to some of the information that
was being so rudely forced from him.
HE HEARP THE S1REX.
Unwillingly he ..was forced to tell of
a renewal of acquaintance with the
woman he claims to have attempted to
avoid. She notified, him over the tele
phone of her whereabouts on her re
turn from New York and he visited her
for the purpose of avoiding her. That
same night there. was a beer_party at
the Oberon, in which Laymance and
the defendant occupied the center of
the stage." This also was in the way of
keeping away from' the woman. In the
early morning hours an automobile ride
to u. roadhouse was undertaken, with
Laymance as host and Miss Lawrence
and three others as guests. This also
was done in the way of side-stepping a
former intrigue. Other collateral mat
ters were gone into, and finally, to the
great relief of Laymance, he was al
lowed to leave the stand. â¢ When he
stepped down he gave one big, gulping
sigh of relief.
During the examination the defend
ant's attorney once called him "Mr.
Lawrence" inadvertantly. Quick as a
flash he turned to the defendant and
apologized for his mistake.
So rigorous was the examination by
defendant's counsel that several times
Judge Cabaniss warned him against
humiliating the witness and finally
threatened him with punishment for
contempt if he persisted in his attacks.
After Laymanee had been dismissed
the prosecution announced that its case
was closed and the defense called Miss
Lawrence to the stand. Under direct
examination she told how Laymance
had met her in accordance with an en
gagement made over the telephone.*
Their tryst was held In a private box
in the Bay State restaurant and on that
occasion she testified that Laymance
sent the waiter out for pen and ink
and wrote out for her a check for $50,
whiqh is now said to be a forgery. The
following morning, on their return from
the automobile drive narrated by Lay
mance, she saidÂ»he slipped a $10 check
Into her hand as she was alighting
from the machine.
BANK TOOK CHECKS.
The check for $100, the genuineness
of which is disputed, she claims to have
received in her room, where she says
Laymance penned his signature and
the body of the document In her pres
ence; All of. these checks were. readily
accepted by the bank on which they
were drawn and no question was raised
when they were presented' for payment.
Some days later she said she received
another check for $100 by a* messenger,
which was delivered to her in her room,
with the name of J. W. Laymance
signed to It. The following day she
took it to the bank and handed it to
the paying teller. He invited her into
the president's office -..and gave the
check to the latter official. The presi
dent told her that Laymance had com
plained that his name had been forged
to two checks and showed her the $30
and $100 checks that are in evidence.
Then he handed back to her the $100
check which she had'.last presented and
she left the bank. She claimed that
during the conversation with President
Swift he said: "I know what^Laymance
is, and you had better go to see him
personally." â¢
She says she went to Laymance's of
fice,-but there were several men there
and she did not;wait.to interview him.
When she reached her apartments she
tore up the check.
The Prosecuting Attorney; began a
cross-examination of the defendant,
which was cut short.by:the,adjourn
