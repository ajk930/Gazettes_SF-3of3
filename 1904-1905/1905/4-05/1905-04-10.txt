FIENDISH PLOT OF MAFIA IS LAID BARE
AND EIGHT OF GANG ARE IN JAIL
A Mafia society plotted Biaggio Vilardo' s death and rented the Green-street house for the purpose. Pietro Torturici wielded the
cleaver and his pretty wife was an accomplice. The police are certain of this. The toils are tightening around Torturici, and seven
suspects, besides the woman, are already under arrest. The rendezvous of the murderers was in a house near Fisherman's Cove.
CRIME PLANNED
IN A LITTLE HUT
AT NORTH BEACH
Conspirators Hire House on Green Street
for the Sole Purpose of Killing
Biaggio Vilardo.
Toils Are Tightening Around Plotting Band
and the Police Are Ready to Make
More Arrests To- Day.
A co-called Mafia organization planned the death of Biaggio Valardo.
It hold two secret meetings In a rendezvous near the Fisherman's wharf at
North Beach and there plotted the horrible murder of the unfortunate Si
cilian. The house at 736% A Green street was rented for the sole purpose of
carrying out the dastardly crime.
The Italian residents of the city are loud in voicing protestations
against the theory that a Mafia or secret organization exists among the
people who have migrated to America from Italy. Yet a Mafia, a "Black
Hand," or whatever name may be applied, does exist In this city.
When Torturici has been captured and is tried for the murder of his
fellow-countryman, he will not be the only prisoner sitting in the dock
waiting for his judgment for the part he played in one of the most fiendish
crimes ever perpetrated la the city of San Francisco.
etro Torturici committed the murder. He was aided by his wife and
possibly by Sam Poesofumi. who was arrested by. Detective Charles Taylor
as he was trying to force his way into the shambles at 736% Green street
the day after the murder. The polLce have in Jail besides Possofumi.- Sal
vatori randa. Rosario Domlna and three other Italians, who stead
fastly refuse to give their names. These were" arrested yesterday by Po
licemen Smith '-'' and Pyle as they attempted to enter the house at
1611 Powell street, where Torturici slept on the night of the murder and
the succeeding night.
Pyle and Carr were doing plain clothes duty yesterday afternoon watch
ing the house at 1611 Powell street with the hope of apprehending some of
Torturici's partners in the crime. About 2 o'clock three Italians or Sicilians
came up the street and started to go into the house. When stopped by the
policemen and asked their names the swarthy men refused to divulge.
They were quickly hurried to the City Prison and lodged in the tanks.
They still refused to give their names or affix their signatures to the book.
These men are believed by the police to be members of the gang that
planned and executed the bloody murder of Biaggio Vilardo.
3lurderous Gang Plans the Death of Vilardo.
The Italian people, the better class who voice their opinions through thÂ«
Italian medium, the newspaper, "La Italia," oppose the theory of the ex
istence of secret organizations among their race. But the Sicilians are only
kin to the Italians. The fact remains that there ie a Mafia.
Brigands and cut-throats of the middle ages never planned with more
cruel deliberation the killing of a man who had incurred their wrath than
did these blood-thirsty Sicilians who met secretly in a little room in the
North Beach section four weeks ago and formulated and plotted the death
of the Sicilian canmaker. Two meetings were held, one four and another
three weeks before the killing. The meetings were well attended.
The murderer had to be decided upon at once. "The devil," Biaggio
Vilardo. who dared to be a friend of the murdered Giusseppe Brogardo,
must meet the fate meted out. Vilardo had been a friend of Brogardo, who
was murdered last January. He had been a constant companion of the
dead man- He aided in the burial, taking money from his own pocket to
give the remains of his life-long friend decent interment. Vilardo paid
a last tribute to the memory of a friend, and then paid with his own life.
Rosa Torturici. as Decoy. Used to Lead Sicilian.
Selection of the best man to execute the murder was considered and
reconsidered. Finally Torturid's name was mentioned. Some one remarked
on the beauty of his wife. Torturici was promptly agreed upon. He was
loyal to the cause of his organization. His friends who appointed him
to do the crime planned to use his wife as a decoy. She was a beautiful
woman. How well she played her part she has not so far told, but the
evidence is in the possession of the police.
Mrs. Torturici was in the house at th* time of the murder. The little
child which she has constantly said she took for an airing in Washington
Square was an unconscious auditor to Vilardo's death cries, perhaps a wit
ness. â¢
Torturici chosen to do the foul deed, the next point to decide was a
favorable place. The house at 710 Montgomery avenue was not safe as
might be. Too many people were within earshot. The family must move,
said the plotting band. Lured to his ultimate destruction, the poor Sicf-
Man asked if he might move with the faintly. Torturici knew he would,
Rosa. Torturici knew Vilardo would want to accompany them. She played
I her part well. She used all of her womanly charms to hold the admiration
of Vilardo.
The house at 736% A Green street was selected for the crime. Down in a
dark basement the three persons went to live, the murdered man, his slayer
and Rose Torturici, the accomplice. The room was left bare for.the murder,
for fabrics absorb blood. '
That the house was notone picked out for permanent residence is shown
by the fact that the rooms were but scantily furnished. The kitchen had but
a small stove and a rude table. Torturici had a tumble-down bed and a few
boxes in his bedroom. Between his bedrom and Vilardo's sleeping-room
was the vacant room, devoid of a single furnishing, well fit for slaughter. In
Vilardo's room was a small cot and table. Not a rug or piece of carpet was
found on the floors in the whole house.
Room Left Bare for the Place of Slaughter.
The three people lived in the house for three weeks. All this while Tor
turici sought in vain for a chance to perform his bloody task. ' He tried
quarreling with Vilardo: sometimes he was successful. but the right mo
ment did not come. Wednesday night relations were strained. Vilardo
took his supper in his little room, pleading sickness. A few hours later his
body had been cut in six pieces.
The details of the crime have not yet been learned and may never be. if
Rosa Torturici and the men in the City Prison keep their silence. Enough
evidence, however, is in the hands of the police to convict the murderer and
all at his accomplices.
After the murder Torturici did not alone carry the burden of the dis
membered body. He had assistance from his fellow-conspirators. Just

PENSACOLA, Fla., April 9.â Vessels
of the North Atlantic fleet here report
an unprecedented series of desertions
of bluejackets. It was to-day estimated
that at least 600 sailors are missing
from the vessels'.
Sailors who have been seen on shore
give varying excuses for leaving the
ships. Some of them have an idea
that the vessels will for the most part
be made station ships at some out-of
the-way place, where disturbances are
not infrequent, and others say their
treatment is not what it should be.
Still others contend that they deserted
only because they wanted to get on
American soil and stay there just as
long as they could.
This morning Chief Schad of the po
lice department went out to the flag
ship Maine and had a conference with
Rear Admiral Evans regarding the
methods of apprehending deserters-
Admiral Evans placed at the disposal
of the Pensacola officer a detachment
of marines to aid in taking in all de
serters found. The determination, to
have them returned to the ships is
strong, and the regulation reward of
$10 per man is being paid out fre
quently.

NEW YORK, April 9.â How Mrs.
Charles T. Yerkes forced the Atlantic
coast line to carry her and her secre
tary and maid to New York on a Pull

has Just become known here.
Mrs. Yerkes was on her way from
Havana to New York, accompanied by
her secretary, William Lauer, and her
maid, and had obtained Pullman ac
commodations at Tampa. Fla. When
the train reached Jacksonville she was
informed that the Pullman sleeper
from Tampa would go no farther and
she must change to another Pullman to
be attached to a train which was about
to pull out for New York. All the ac
commodations she could have were an
upper berth for herself and a seat each
for her secretary and maid.
Mrs. Yerkes insisted that she had
purchased through accommodations
and refused to leave the Pullman. Ac
cording to Mrs. Yerkes she was delayed
several hours. Finally the railroad of
ficials yielded and the car was attached
later to a train on the Atlantic coast
line.

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. April 9.â ln the re
cent sale of $15,000,000 worth of Brit
ish war ships as Junk, some naval offi
cers have again been reminded of the
problem as to the ultimate disposi
tion of United States naval vessels
which have become obsolete.
The British vessels sold are not as
old as the American cruiser Chicago
(1883) and are but little older than
the Philadelphia, the San Francisco
and the Baltimore, which are of about
the same displacement (1888). The
Chicago is now the flagship of the Pa
cific squadron, having recently been
thoroughly repaired, while the Bal
timore is in commission and the San
Francisco is now undergoing exten
sive reDairs.
The Navy Department, whatever it
may have had in mind, has not yet
announced its determination to put
entirely out of service these active
contemporaries of the ships which
the British admiralty had consigned
to the Junk pile.
The same may be said of the gun
boat Topeka (1881) and the dispatch
boat Dolphin (1883).

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, April f.â "William H.
Taft, now Secretary of War. will be
the next President of the United States.
If he lives."
This was the positive statement made
to-day by a man who is prominent in
the councils of the administration and
who is known to enjoy the confidence
of the President.
;â¢ "President Roosevelt. " he continued.
"is Just as firm to-day in his intention
not to accept a renomination as he was
when ;he made the' announcement on
the night of the election. Kven if there
were 10 be a general demand, regard
less of party, that he succeed . himseii.
the -President,' iiKe Washington, would
adhere to his resolution I ana . Kive the
country some gooa . advice about not
keeping one man in omce " for too lone
a period. â¢ '= .. .
â¢Having decided to lay down the
burdens -of omce :at the end -of his
term, President . Roosevelt is deeply
concerned over the question of the suc
cessorship. He wants the next President
to be a j man who will carry out hia
policies, ; especially ;as they affect the
trusts and : the - railroads; a man who
will be President tor the -whole. Deome.
who will punish: dishonest office hold
ers I and . eliminate j the , principle ' of
â¢graft' from the administration â¢of the
affairs 'of - the Government. The Presi
dent feels that, while he can and will
accomplish much toward this end. his
efforts will : . have been partially wasted
if ; his successor fail to carry . on the
work and. permit a lapse to conditions
such as have prevailed in the oast.
"Secretary Taft is a man after the
President's own heart and thorouehlv
in accord with the chief executive in
his efforts toÂ» effect great reforms for
the benefit of the masses. For this
reason Mr. Roosevelt would like to see
Taft succeed to the Presidency, and in
a quiet way he will do what he can
to bring about such a desirable result.
The President's faith In Taft is illus
trated at the present moment by the
fact that the Secretary of War is act
ing President and Secretary of State
as well; in fact, when there is any
work for which the President wants a
man whom he can trust imDlicitlv,
Taft Is chosen. By the time Mr. Roose
velt's term draws to a close. Taft will
be well fitted to step into the Presi
dency and to carry out the policies to
which the present chief executive Is
committed heart and soul."
Secretary Taft is now jocularly re
ferred to as the "trinity" of the admin
istration. He is acting as President of
the United States, is Secretary of State
during the absence of Hay and is Sec
retary of War in his own right. Some
of his friends are "poktn* fun" at the
Secretary and broadly intimate that he
is the whole Government.
Wayne MacVeagh. Attorney General
of the Cleveland administration, called
up Taft over the telephone and lnnuired
when the Secretary of War would begin
to discharge the duties of Secretary
of the Treasury and Secretary of the
Interior, as he had some business with
these officials, and. as Taft was so srood
natured. he liked to transact business
with him. Of course this was not a re
flection on the other two Cabinet of
ficers.
Secretary Taft replied that he had
his hands full now. "sitting on the lid."
and would not undertake to perform the
work of any other Cabinet officers.

The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Telegraph says that sober, calcu
lating minds among the naval tfldn
do not expect a derisive victory for th*
Russian fleet. All <hey expect is that
Admiral Rojestvensky will withstand
the Japanese onslaught stubbornly and

The same correspondent says that the
military committee has at last reported
its conclusion that it would be a grave
mistake to abandon the struggle before
Russia's resources are manifestly ex
hausted and that Russia still has ef
fective means â¢rf continuing the war
with the hope of such success as will
influence the character of the peace
conditions.
The officials in St. Petersburg declare
that Rojestvensky has gained a strate
gical advantage by not waiting fur the
third squadron, as he will take the Jap
anese by surprise.
The main Japanese naval forces are
believed to be in Northern Chinese wa

It is quite generally assumed that
Vice Admiral Rojestvensky does not

will attempt to reach Vladivostok,
where there are decks and shops,
seize a base. The latter course is
deemed unsatisfactory, on account of
the poor facilities and the danger of
political complications. Many believe

Beveral features of particular Inter
est are worth noting tn the programmes
and the oasts. "L.u<Ma." for instance,
will br sung without cuts. Usually at
the Metropolitan Opera-house Donizet
ti s favorite opera has been shortened
by the omission of the last act. As a f
consequence "Lucia" has appeared to
be an opera intended chiefly for the
display of a soprano star. Toe pres
ence of Mr. Caruso in the company this
year puts a new complexion on the
oase and in the fourth act he will have
one of his most exceptionally good op
portunities for the display of his mar
velous voice and his delightful art.
Mme. Sembrich is never more effective
than in the character of the distraught
Lucia. Her coloratura work in the
great mad scene Is said* to be as re
markable as ever. Mr. .Parvis has
made an excellent impression in the
part of Lord Aehton and Mr. Journet
will be welcome as Riamcmda. .Arturo

On Tuesday afternoon we shall come

i temptation scene nothing but Wagner's
; stage directions prevented Parsifal
from succumbing to her allurements.
Another delightful novelty or fceml
r.ovelty. of the week will be ihe master
work of Johann Strauss, the waltz
king, which will be presented on
Thursday evening. The production of
"Die Fledermaue"' at the Metropolitan
this season was one of the greatest
: successes 1n the managerial experience
jjk>f Mr. Heinrich Conried. who hlmseif
1 devoted weeks of labor to rehearsing
the work. The cast by which it will be
interpreted has never been rivaled
1 either here or abroad in the annals of
j i omlo opera. Mme. Sembrich is said to
| be inimitable as Rosalinde, the clever
; and spritely heroine of the opera. She
throws herself into the part with the
most \vhole-gouled spirit and, while
lavishing upon it all the re
sources of her art, never for
i moment mars the impression de
: sired by the composer by playing it in
1 the manner of a tragedy queer). Miss
I Marion Weed, who will be new to us,
| will sing the amusing part of the Rus
sian Prince, Orlofsky. Miss Weed
corqes to San Francisco with an en
viable reputation, parned at the Metro
politan and in Hamburg, where for
some years she appeared as the leading
| dramatic soprano of the Stadt Theater.
i Miss Bella Alten should do wonders,
I by all accounts, with the soubrette role
! of Adele. . Of the men, Mr. Dippel is
reputedly most diverting as Gabriel
yon Eisenstein. Mr. Gorlt* made a pro
i.ouheed hit in New York by his in
terpretation of Frank, more particu
larly In the granting scene. Mr. Reisa,
Mr. Muehlmann and Mr. Greder will
all add materially 'to the excellence of
the cast. The musical direction will
! be confided to Nahan Franke. who did
! splendidly with "Die Fledermaus" in
New York.
To Wagner lovers the revival on Sat
urday afternoon of "Die Meistersinger"
on an elaborate and remarkable scale
should be an event of unusual signifi
cance. It will show San Francisco the
greatest Hans Sachs on the stage, Mr.
Van Rooy, an excellent and graceful
Walther yon Stolzljig (Mr. Dippel), a
dainty and attractive Eva (Miss Belle
Alten) and a Beckmesser who, is said
to make all hiÂ«? forerunners look like
caricatures (Mr. Goretz). The New-
York critics fairly gushed over the
artistic beauties of "Die Meistersinger"
as it was presented during the winter
by Mr. Conried.
The masterpiece of Ponchielli. "La
Gioconda," will be the attraction on
Wednesday and Saturday evenings. It
will be lavishly and tastefully staged,
as it deserves to be, and the cast by
which it will be Interpreted will Include
on Wednesday Mme. Nordica, Mme.
Louise Homer and Mme. Jacoby, Scotti,
Journet and Caruso. On Saturday even
ing Miss Mulford will replace Mme.
Jacoby. The interpretation of the part
of the hero, Enzo Grunaidl, ranks with
the most wonderful achievements of
Caruso, and all the stars are heard to
exceptional advantage in the opera.
The ballets, "La Furlana" and "La
Danza delle Ore," will enhance the
charm of "La Gioconda."

CHICAGO, April 9. â Events are I
j shaping rapidly for another wheat I
tragedy like that which cost Joseph
i Letter millions of dollars in 189$. Then .
I it was Letter against P. D. Armour, j
! and the packer won. Now it is John
i W. Gates and his friends against J.
I Ogden Armour.
The men popularly supposed to be
: behind the present May deal have un

I capital. If they use their nerve to the |
I end the operators who are watching the
â¢ battle from afar believe they will sur
' render the" millions they have piled up
in scalping and more million*, too.
i There is an ominous movement of
: wheat to Chicago in anticipation of the J
close of the May deal seven weeks j
, hence. The amount, so say men who j
are fighting the "corner," is enough to
make the bravest captains of specula
tion quail. They insist that it is doubt
ful if even the "Gates crowd," noted
for cleverness, daring and financial
; strength, will care to "face the music"
. to the end, for if they are successful
: on the surface they will be confronted
I with litigation over contract wheat and
; other points of law.
It Is open gossip that if the "shorts"
I are pressed too hard they will aek the
I courts for protection and if the prece
dent M worth anything they are likely
' to find a welcome friend on the bench.
It may be hard to persuade a cool, cal
culiting Judge that May wheat is
worth $1 50 on May 31 and worth only
%1 22 the day following.
In the last analysis it will be found
! that Armour's shrewdness has been
i pitted against thp manipulator's deft- .
; ness of the Gates contingent. J. Ogden !
; Armour worked quietly, but persistent- j
â  ly. like his famous father. He has been I
skimming rrram off the Gates "cor- I
j ner" until things have reached a stage
j where he feels like fighting more in the
I open.

MEET IN CAUSE
OF WOMANHOOD
WASHINGTON. April 9. â Many
women internationally prominent iri
the movement for the betterment of
womanhood and childhood assembled
at the First Congregational Church
this afternoon, when the fifth trien
nial meeting- of the National Council
of Women of the United States was
called to order by the President, Mrs.
Mury Woodswift. Miss Susan B* An
thony received a cordial welcome. Ad
dresses outlining the purpose of the
council were made by Mrs. J. Ellen
Foster. Mrs. Mary Church Terrell,
Mrs. Kate Waller Barrett, Mrs. Han
nah C. Salomon and Mr!. Maria
Wrignt Sewall.
Mrs. Terrell spoke of citizenship
from a woman's point of view, and in
this she touched on problems con
fronting the negro women.
"The colored Â«n r omen of this coun
try." she said, "are doing as much to
promote good citizenship as their"
more fortunate sisters in white. This
is interpreted by them to mean an in
telligent regard and tender care of
their children and a conscientious
and careful consideration of every
question which concerns the welfare
of the race. Colored women," she
concluded, "believe that good citi
zenship means the protection of the
womanhood of the race, insisting that
the men who transgress the moral
laws shall be banished from good so
ciety, as inevitably as the women they
destroy."
Mrs. Salomon brought the greetings
of the National Jewish Council of
Women.
"The religion which I represent."
she said, "has something of harmony
for all religions, for Judea gave the
world its civilized religion. No na
tion which loses its religion can surr
vive. Here in the council all creeds
can get along together by doing jus
tice to all."
ARREST DEPUTY
FOR OLD MURDER
PHOENIX, Ariz., April 9.â Ranger â 
Sparks arrived here tQ-day from Clifton [
having In custody W> A. Hobbs, better ,
known as Lee Hobbs, a deputy sheriff
of Graham County, a cousin of the *
Sheriff and having many relatives in ,
this section. Hobbs is charged with â¢
the murder of Captain John Bennett ,
Nixon of the British ship Leicester
Castle on September 2, 1902. The mur- .
der is alleged to have been committed ,
within ten knots of Pttcairn Island in .
the South Seas. Identification of the I
accused was made by a sailor traveling
as a tramp, who saw and recognized
Hobbs.
Hobbs has been a resident of Arizona '
four years. He claims he was a deputy I
sheriff of Graham County at the time i
of the alleged murder. He denies any j
knowledge of the crime and says It is ,
a case of mistaken identity, and that he i
can prove an alibi. He declares he has ;
never been outside the Territory more â¢
than a month and can so prove. His
accusers, however, it is said, feel cer- I
tain of their ground.

jective, the Pacific is considered to be
more favorable for the accomplishment
of his purpose, although it largely de
pends on Vice Admiral Rojestvensky
himself.
The Japanese newspapers and public
express relief and pleasure over the
approach of the Russian second Pacific
squadron, as well as confidence in the
abirrtyof Admiral Togo's fleet to van
quish it.
"PHANTOM SQTADRON" TO SAII/.
Vladivostok Warships Ordered -to Par
ticipate in Coming Battle.
St. PETERSBURG, April 10.â There
is reason to believe that Vice Admiral
Rojestvenskys entrance into the China
Sea has been followed by orders for
the "cruisers Gromoboi, Russia and Bo
gatyr, which have been ready for some
time at Vladivostok, to put to sea.
Whether it is tjie intention to send
them south immediately ; or to hold
them in the vicinity of Vladivostok is
not known. Their appearance outside
the .roadstead of Vladivostok would
constitute a. potential threat against
{ Admiral Togo's rear, which will com
pel the retention in or the dispatch of
a number of fighting ships to Japan
| ese waters. Thus Admiral Togo seems
!to be virtually placed between two
i fires.
The peace influence in the Govern
' ment urges that this favorable strate
gic position presents the psychological
. moment for offering officially the olive
! branch to Japan, reasoning that, no
; matter how confident ' the Japanese
! Government may be of Togo's victory,
it cannot overlook the possibility of de->
feat, nor fail to appreciate the com
plete disaster which would follow the
transfer of the mastery of the sea to
Russia. With so much depending, upon
the issue, they argue, both countries
have mutual interests in avoiding an
actual test, and it is not impossible,
therefore, that a move in the direction
of peace may come Just as the world
expects to hear the call to quarters for
the greatest naval battle of modern
times.
Certainly the spirits of the war party
have been greatly raised by Rojestven
sky's success in penetrating to the
China Sea: and the prospect of a. naval
battle, even with the odds against a
Russian victory, which would change
1 the entire complexion -of the situation,
has aroused something like a Hash of
enthusiasm in many Russian breasts. .
I Some naval officers express the opin
ion that Rojestvensky, having now
safely navigated the str.aits, instead of
1 'sailing. north to- meet the Japanese, pan
afford to calmly await Vice Admiral
Nebogatoff with his division of the
squadron, who could arrive there in
about three weeks.
The Russian Admiralty yesterday re
ceived a long dispatch from Singa
pore, but no intimation as to its con
tents has been gfven the newspapers.
The papers of Sunday morning printed
1 Singapore dispatches without comment,
the Svlet being the only exception.
This paper viewg the news from Ro-
Jestveneky as an suspicious prelude to
a decisive battle, "which may show
'. that over Rojestvensky still shines the
happy star which. helped him. when a
1 lieutenant, to save the fragile Vesta
J in an unequal conflict with a Turkish
battleship." The Sviet expresses the
1 hope that Rojestvensky is destined to
turn the table* and that even in case
' of defeat some of his vessels will be
1 able to break through and reach the
' Japanese Sea.

thrown at the Dowager Empress when
she went to a hospital which she con

FIRE CAUSES
THEATER PANIC
KOKOMO. Ind.. April 9.â A panic
was caused in the Sipt Theater here
to-night when a roll of celluloid films
used in operating a moving picture
machine suddenly burst into flames. A
score of persons were severely burned
and George Armstrong. 18 years old,
who, in his hurry to escape from the
building jumped through a window on
the third floor was fatally injured.
A moving picture show was in prog- ;
ress. During the intermission a bag
of celluloid films suspended over the
balcony railing was ignited by an elec- !
trie light. The machine operator
brought the audience into a panic by
crying, "Look out everybody; the thea
ter is on fire." In an instant 600 peo
ple became a crushing, rushing mass
of humanity. That more were not hurt
was due largely to the excellent system
of fire escapes and exits in the theater
and fhe deportment of the house em
ployes.
Armstrong occupied a seat in the j
gallery and at the warning cry broke
a plate glass window and jumped to
the sidewalk, a distance of forty feet.
Both his legs were broken and he was
internally injured.
Mrs. Bert Jacobs was so affected by
the shock as to require the attention
of a physician. Her condition is se
rious.
Vance Hunt was badly burned by the
flaming films. Several others were se
verely burned. The theater was dam
aged by Â«ir.okÂ» only.

motherly devotion by acting as god
moiJier to one of the James children,
wh<T bear?; her sponsor's name, and
seemingly delig-hts in seeing her own
children in the company of Mrs. Willie
James.
Willie James is a man of great
wealth, which he inherited in this coun
try, where he was bom. He is a great
hunter and has often accompanied King
Edward on his hunting trips. In Eng
land, where he has spent the greater
part of his life, he is known as "the
husband of his accomplished wife,"
and apparently is satisfied with the
distinction bestowed upon him.
James' fathers first wife was a daugh
ter of Anson G. Phelps. but the mother
of the former was an English woman,
which fs supposed to account for the
Jameses strong preference for life on
British Roil. Mrs. Willie James' mother
was a sister of Lady Mordaunt. whose
rame figured so prominently some
years ago In the British divorce courts,
and of Gevrgina. Countess of Dudley.
Like her husband, Mrs. James is of
American descent, and this fact has
often been the subject of comment in
connection with her popularity at the
court of St. James, where even the
presence of distinguished American
women, like the Duchess of Man
rhester, Mrs. Cornwall is- West and oth
ers, have In no way affected her social
influence.
The Jameses arrived from London
late in February and were the recipi
ents of much attention In New York
isrriety. where many brilliant events
r f-v given in their honor. Just before
starting on their Western trip they
were the guests of Mrs. Ogden Mills
at a dinner at which were assembled
the most fashionable of New York
City. Shortly after thHr a.rrlva.l hÂ»re
yesterday the Jameses enjoyed a ride
to the x>ark and ocean beach and re
tired early to prepare for more strenu
ous sightseeing to-day.

FREDERICK, O. T., April 9. â
President Roosevelt and party left
Frederick shortly before 7 o'clock
yesterday evening and arrived at the
camp, eighteen miles southeast of
town, a little after dark. The camp
is nestled in timber fringing the bank
of Deep Red Creek in a picturesque
spot. When the President arose at
6:15 o'clock this morning and first be
held the vast panorama of virgin soil
without a sign of civilization except
the camp, he said he felt at home.
Major J. E. Muchert ot Sheman,
with C. B. McHugh and J. R. AVern
athy of this place, located the camp
last Monday, riding out to the big
pasture which begins four miles east
of here. A number of wolves and lo
boes were seen in the big reservation
as they passed through.
The camp consists or about twenty
tents belonging to the Prssidential
party and is oalleu Camp Koosevelt.
One large tent is occupied as a mess
hall, a number of tents being used
for sleeping apartments, four cots be
ing placed in earn tent. About a
stone's throw from these tents is
Camp Quanah Parker, occupied by
this noted chief of th*> Comanches,
three of his squaws and some other
Indians. These Indians traveled
over forty miles yesterday to get to
see the President. A detail of twen
ty troops was sent from Fort Sill to
keep trespassers from this part of the
reservation. Their camp is about 100
yards from that of Camp Roosevelt.
The people here, however, appre
ciate the fact that the President is
here for an outing and are remaining
from the pasture. The President sur
prised the cowboys and cattlemen by
his knowledge of horses.
Upon leaving his private car yes
terday he was driven to the grand
stand behind the team of Ed Carter
of this place. The speaking over, he
was assigned to Burke Barnett's
dashing team and no time was lost in
getting to the camp. Captain Bill
McDonald of the Rangers, and Col
onel Lyon rode out with Ed Carter.
General Young with Tom Waggoner,
the cattle baron, and Dr. Lambert
with C. B. McHugh. While Dr. Lam
bert was exercising his horse this
morning he was thrown but not in
jured.
The doctor spent about an hour tak
ing a number of photographs of the
party, with their dogs and horses.
These will be used to illustrate an arti
cle which the President will write con
cerning the hunt. There are about
thirty-five saddle horses and fifty dogs
at the camp.
The President has been assigned three
horses belonging to Tom Waggoner and
a like number belonging to Burnett,
and expects to be up early to-morrow
morning, when the hunt will begin. A
number of officials of the Frisco rail
road who arrived in the Presidents
train are still here and will remain.un
tll Thursday morning, when the tents
at Camp Roosevelt will be struck and
the President will start for Colorado.
In the hunting party besides the
President are General S. If. B. Young,
U. S. A.; Colonel Cecil Lyon of Sher
man. Captain Burke Burnett. Sloan
Simpson, Lieutenant G. R. Fortescue,
Dr. Alexander Lambert of New York,
J. R. Abernathy of FredericlTand two
ranger captains. United States Marshal
Bill Fossett of Guthrie and L. D. Mil
ler, one of the owners of the great "101"
ranch.
LAWTON, O. T., April 9.â lt is said
that President Roosevelt intends to
visit Fort Sill and that the soldiers of
the Eighth Cavalry, under command of
Major Murchert of the Texas National
Guard, who are now guarding the
President's camp in the big pasture,
will on Wednesday escort him to that
post. The officers of the Eighth Cav
alry are now making preparations and
will give him an elaborate banquet.
United States Marshal Bill Fossett of
Guthrie, a personal friend of the Presi
dent, will join the hunting party.
FORT "WORTH, Tex., April 9.â ln a
suite of rooms on the parlor floor in
the Hotel Worth, in this city, the seat
of the United States Government has
been temporarily established. In the
absence of the President, who is hunt
ing coyotes and jackrabbits over in the
wilds of the Kiowa-Comanche reserva
tion in Oklahoma, his official business
is given attention by Secretary Loeb.
Most of the business will be acted upon
by the Secretary and directed to
various departments in Washington.
That which requires the personal su
pervision of the President will have to
wait until Thursday, for it is not until
then that communication will be estab
lished with the hunting party.
After delivering the President into
the hands of Western friends, who
have undertaken to furnish him with
wholesale recreation for a few days,
the officials boarded the special train
and returned to this city. It reached
here at 3 o'clock this morning, and at
10 o'clock the party went to the hotel
and opened headquarters. It had been
expected that there would be an ac
cumulation of mail, but for some rea
son the local postoffice forwarded it to
Frederick, Okla. It was necessary to
telegraph for the return of the mail,
and most of it will not arrive until to
morrow. In the meantime the official
party is enjoying a rest.
Secretary Loeb expects to receive
â word from the President to run the
special train to Frederick on Thursday
and on that day start for Western Colo
rado, to which point the President will
go for the purpose of finding larger
game than abounds on the Red River
in Oklahoma.
According to present plans the pub
lic part of the trip West Is ended. It
is not expected any steps will be made
until the train reaches Colorado
Springs, and then a stop of two hours
will be necessary, but not for the pur
pose of speech- making.

BLOWS OUT HIS BRAINS
IN DAUGHTER'S PRESENCE
Charles S. Philips, a Despondent
Bricklayer. 1 ids His Life In a
Trag! â  Manner.
Charles S. Phillips, a bricklayer, 45
year? old, ended his life last night at
1040 Shotwell street by blowing out his
brains in the presence of his two
daughters, Sarah and Agnes Phillips.
Despondency is believed to have been
the cause of the rash act.
Phillips entered the dining-room,
where his daughters were seated and
exclaimed "I am going to do it." He
pulled out a revolver and fired a shot
through the roof of the house. Then
he placed the weapon in his mouth and
pulled the trigger twice, blowing out his
brains and tearing a hole through the
top of his head. The body was removed
to the Morgue.

Diabolical Plot to Take the Life of Biag
gio Vilardo Hatched by Gang.
Continued From Pagp 1, Columns 1 and 2.
The whole murderous plot was deep
laid, with the cunning of the men who
fight vendettas in far-away Sicily. Had
the head of the victim been made away
with his identity might never have
been made known, and the band of
cutthroats might have gone on unde
tected with diabolical plots and taken
more innocent lives.
There is /io doubt in the minds of
the police that the Brogardo murder,
the affection shown by Vilardo for his
dead friend, the aid he gave in the
burial and the covert assistance ren
dered the detectives during the prose
cution of Ancio Brissile were respon
sible for the killing of Vilardo. The
intimidation of witnesses and perjury
on the part of those testifying at the
trial of Brissile were the result of the
"Black Hand's" strength. The trial
has not yet reached its conclusion.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
NEW YORK, April 9. â In the course
of his sermon in Plymouth Church,
Brooklyn, to-day, the Rev. Dr. Dwight
Hillis referred to the gift of^llOO.ooo
made by John D. Rockefeller to the
American Board of Foreign Missions
and to Rockefeller's son. He said, in
part:
The saddest words that have been written
In this generation were spoken before Brown
University by a younj man who is to inherit
one of the greatest fortunes in this country.
They were spoken in deienge of the trusts.
Listen to them:
"The American Beauty rose can be produced
in all its splendor only by sacrificing the early
buds that grow up around It."
The rose had 1000 buds and In order to pro
duce the American Beauty the gardener goes
around it with a knife nnd snips 699 in order
tha.t all the strength and beauty may be forced
into one bloom. In this economic argument
this younjr man brutally tells the working
classes that WJ small business men must be
snuffed out of existence in order that his
American beauty, the trust, may be produced.
Usten to Christ: "Let the strong b;ar the
burdens of the weak." And again: "Give
and It shall be given unto you."
These words in defense of the trusts are the
most heart-breaking things In literature to
those who know what is poing to come In the
future. Can you wonder that after that when
a man gives gifts we have no gratitude to re
turn?
CHICAGO. April 9.â ln a sermon to
day by Bishop Fallows of St. Paul's
Reformed Episcopal Church on "Mak
ing the Best of Tainted Money" he
said:
It is taken for granted that Rockefeller's
methods of obtaining money are reprehensible
In the highest degre*. Does the acceptance of
jtOO.OW hj- the American board condone the
offenses with 11 which the oil magnate Is charged?
DoeÂ« it thereby give him a ctear passport to
heaven?
No church has accepted his money with any
such condition attached to It. Vasiar College,
founded by a brewer and endowed with the
pro.-p<Â»<is of the sale of intoxicant*, is doing a
vast amount of eood.
I 6ay, accept Rockefeller's gift and all other
gifts from this or any other source and sanctify
them by usinp them for the good of mankind.
OSLER FINDS
DISCIPLE HERE
Out of Dr. Osier's remarkable theory
that man reaches the limit of his use
fulness at fifty years and should then
be chloroformed, there has sprung a
tragedy in this city. The lifeless body
of Timothy W. Chamberlln, a well
known pioneer and former Assessor of
Solano County, was found last night in
Golden Gate Park, near Strawberry
Hill.
The discovery was made by two boys,
Philip Coggins of 1710 Diamond street
and Harold Dillis of 327 Jersey street.
The body had been exposed to the ele
ments for several days. The Coro
ner's office was notified and the body
removed to the Morgue. Nothing that
would identify the dead man wa*s found
in the pockets. An artificial lower
limb furnished the clew that led to his
identification. Chamberlin had been
reported missing since last Monday,
and in the Police Bulletin, the official
organ of the "upper" office, mention
was made of this peculiarity. T. S.
Chamberlin, a son of the deceased,
identified the remains.
That the unfortunate man died as the
result of the promulgation of Dr. Os
ier's doctrine there can be no doubt.
The son declares that his father was
intensely interested in what Osier ad
vocated and often discussed the matter
at home. He had reached the advanced
age of 72 years, and although not finan- i
cially embarrassed was not in affluent i
circumstances. Although an expert ac- |
countant he was unable to find employ
ment, and he brooded much over this.
Applications made to several counting
houses always met with refusal on ac- '
count of his age. On last Monday he j
left his apartments at the Hotel Elaine,
532 Turk street, where he resided with
his wife and son, never to return again.
A note on the dresser to his wife con- |
veyed the information that he would ]
not return until he found employment, j
Met on every side, in response to his >
applications for employment, with j
'You're too old," Chamberlin sadly be
took himself to Golden Gate Park, j
thoroughly imbued with the idea that
Dr. Osier was right in his declaration.
What means he used to end his exist- j
enqe 1b not known, but It is presumed I
that he availed himself of the method
advocated by Osierâ chloroform.
"There is no doubt that my father
ended his life as the result of Dr. Os
ier's theory," said the son last night.
"He often spoke of the subject, and I
knon- that it preyed on his mind. He
tried to get employment in several
large houses, but they said he was too
old. This seemed to make him very
despondent at times. Last Monday he
left the house and left a note which
sajd: 'I will not return until I get
something to do, so do not look for
me.' "
. Chamberlain was born in New Jer
in the toils of the law now and the
arrest of Torturici is hourly expected.
The police have valuable information,
but refuse to divulge it at this time,
fearing to allow Torturici a chance to
escape.
The police believe that Torturici is
aided in eluding the police by his fel
low-conspirators, who provide him with
money and a hiding place. The detec
tives are divided as to whether the
murderer is in this city or out of town.
If Torturici is captured, startling de
velopments will be made. It Is be
lieved that he cannot elude the police
many more days. The identity of many
of the men who planned the murder of
Vilardo in a little hut near Fisher
man's Cove is known to the police, and
at least ten of them may be made ac
cessories to the crime of Pietro Tor
turici. More arrests are expected to
day.

LOSE REASON
Ten of Those Who Survived
the Reservoir Disaster
in Madrid Become Maniacs
KING AT HOSPITALS
Students and Laborers March
Through Streets to Gather
Money for the Victims
MADRID, April 9.â lt appears that
underneath the foundations of the res
ervoir which gave way with such dis
astrous results on Saturday were water
pipes used to supply the palace and old
Madrid. It is stated that this was the
cause for the subsidence. The vault
was built of cement, with iron girders,
as were also the supporting columns.
The first fall caused all the pillars to
bend and the end of the Ironwork to
stretch, resulting in a general and uni
form collapse. These explanations, how
ever, cannot be considered as final.
Madrid newspapers publish assertions
that the disaster was foreseen by en
gineers, as well as by workmen. It is
now recalled that the bad condition of
the soil on which the reservoir was con
structed caused keen opposition and
numerous criticisms when the scheme
was being discussed in the Cortes.
Ten of those who were rescued alive
have gone mad. A huge crowd stood
around the scene throughout the night
watching the attempts at rescue in the
light of huge electric lamps. Crowds of
workmen and women carrying flags
forced all the theaters to close Satur
day night.
King Alfonso had a telephone wire
laid from the scene of the disaster to
the palace and was kept constantly in
formed. The King again visited the
hospitals this morning.
Seven hundred workmen are engaged
in clearing the debrta. During the day
students and workmen paraded the
streets collecting money for the fami
lies of the victims of the disaster. The
public Is contributing freely. The Gov
ernor of Madrid has prohibited a great
popular demonstration of mourning
which the workmen wished to organize,
but he received the delegates of the
workmen's associations, whom hÂ« in
formed that a street procession would
be permitted under pertain restrictions.
King Alfonso, accompanied by Senors
Montiegul and Coblan. respectively
Ministers of War and Marine, and their
suites, left to-night for Valencia,
where the students' strike has ended,
though there were disorders Saturday
night, when the students burned sev
eral tramway cars. Energetic police
measures have been taken and it is ex
pected that the King will be warmly
welcomed.
An exact estimate of the casualties
in the reservoir disaster is still impos
sible. It is stated that there were 236
men in the lower part of the reservoir,
all of whom were killed.
Carrying black banners, 5000 work
men made a demonstration this after
noon near the scene of Saturday's res
ervior disaster. The police on seizing
the flags were stoned by the crowd, and
several on both sides were seriously in
jured.
sey and came across the plains in the
early fifties with a large drove of
cattle. He settled in Solano County,
where he resided continuously for
forty years. Chamberlain was elected
Assessor of Solano County for two
terms, and also as Assessor of the
city of Vallejo. He removed to this
city a few years ago. A widow and
one son survive him.

TAFT AS PEACEMAKER
Convinces Cullom That Mr.
Koosevelt Took the Only
Course Open to Him
Special Dispatch to Til* CaiL
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, April 9.â Approximate
harmony now prevails between the
leaders of the Senate and the adminis
tration, so far as the President's action
in agreeing to the selection of Ameri
can citizens to collect the revenues of
Santo Domingo is concerned, and all
danger of rupture i 3 now believed to
have passed.
When Senator Cullom. chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee, ar
rived here yesterday he was greatly
disturbed over what was characterized
as the President's defiance of the Sen
ate in entering into an agreement
with Santo Domingo which provided
for doing practically the same things
specified in the treaty which was be
fore the Senate and which was not rati
fied. Senator Cullom went to see Sec
retary Taft, who is acting Secretary
of State, to ascertain what the ad
ministration had done in Santo Do
mingo, to learn what precedent or au
thority the President had for taking
any actftm after the Senate had de
clined to ratify the treaty and why the
President had waited until the Senate
adjourned and the Senators had left
the city before he agreed to the propo
sition to practically take charge of the
Government of Santo Domingo.
In fact. Senator Cullom did not like
what had been done and did not hesi
tate to say so; but there was no quar
rel between the Senator and the Sec
retary of War. Before Senator Cul
lcm left the good-natared and suave
official he was convinced that the
President's course was the proper one.
and as a result the Senate will stand
by the President, so far as the Repub
licans are concerned.
Secretary Taft explained that im
mediately after the Senate adjourned
without ratifying the treaty the situa
tton in Santo Domingo became acute
and that Italy and Belgium threat
ened to take extreme steps to collect
the debts owed by Santo Domingo to
thfeir subjects. Th*> peculiar circum
stances existing demanded that some
thing be done to preserve the status
quo and maintain order, especially as
the Republicans could not muster
enough votes to ratify the treaty.

BERKELEY, April 9.â A daring at
tempt of three cracksmen to open and
rifle the big safe In the office of Post
master George Schmidt at 3 o'clock
this morning was frustrated by the
wakefulneas of Mrs. F. S. Eastman,
who lives on Oxford street, adjoining
the postoffiee. Mr*. Eastman heard the
noise made by the safebreakers, arose
and saw the men prowling about in the
postoffice. She telephoned .to Marshal
Kearns and a deputy put the robbers
tv rout.
The booty the cracksmen would have
{( und in the safe would have amount
ed to $18,000. Of this sum $3000 was in
cash and the remainder in negotiable
st&mps. Not a penny was secured by
the intruders. They took their tools
with them in making a "getaway."
A fourth man. associated with the
safe crackers, la believed to have act
ed as a decoy to lure Watchman*
George Thompson away from the
scene. Early this morning Thompson
observed a man on Center street, near
Shattuck avenue, peering into win
dow* in a suspicious manner. The
stringer moved on down Center street,
away from the business district, a dis
tance of half a mile or more, with
Thompson in close pursuit, but making
no eftort to capture him. Finally the
watchman lost sight of his quarry and
returned to his beat,
While this decoy was leading away
the only police officer on duty in the
town the three men were busily en
paged breaking into the postoffiee.
Entrance to â¢Postmaster Schmidt's
office was easily gained, a "Jimmy"
being used to open the door. Once in
side a screw was put into the door,
fastening it securely so that if the
dcÂ«*>r was tried from the outside it
would seem to be locked. It was this
precaution that enabled the burglars
to make their escape in safety later.
All the work done on the safe has
the marks of professional talent. Two
holes were drilled into the door and
in these were inserted bars attache!
to a bit of mechanism that permitted
the operation of a jackscrew on the
safe door. The door was pried open
about one inch: Then dynamite mas
used to blow off the door. The first
charge was not big enough. It did
not move the door or there was not
space enough for the cracksmen to in
sert their hands.
It was at this stage that discovery
of their operations was made by* Mrs.
Eastman. She sleeps lightly and . the
muffled noise of the explosion awak
ened her. She arose, peered through
her window into the postofflce and
saw three men moving quickly about.
' She rang up Marshal Kerns and
Deputy Burt Howard at once respond
ed. He tried first to enter Schmidt's
office by the door through which the
safe breakers had entered. He found
it closed and immovable. While he
rattled the door knob and tested the
door the burglars made their escape,
leaving through the Oxford street
door on the side. Howard heard that
door Slam and hurried to the other side
of the building, but was too late to
catch even a glimpse of the fleeing
crooks. No trace of them has yet
been found.
No attempt was made by the post
office officials to open the nafe to-day.
They are sure that all its contents are
intact and report that nothing else in
the office was molested. Several' hun
dred dollars in cash and stamps was
in boxes outside the safe and this
could have easily been secured had*
the robbers searched with any care.

THE FIREMEN
Department Officials In
tover Kvidence of Attempt
to Destroy a Paint Shop
TRAIN LAID FOR FLAMK
Inflammable Stuff Saturated
I With Oils, and Only Timely
Discovery Checks Big Blaze
OAKLAND. April 9. â Rank incen
diarism whs done last night, according
lo the Fire Department officials, in an
â .tfeCOftpi to destroy the paint store of
Max Dohrmann & Co., 760 Seventh
street. Evidence no plain that it was
more than convincing confronted the
department as soon as the locked and
barred doors had been brokf-n down
*nd the well-kindled fire brought un
der control. Lucky and timely dis
covery of the fire prevented the de
struction of the materials that had
been used to sweep the store and con
tents into a mass of flames. On all
sides the testimony of carefully laid
plans was manifest in so palpable a
manner that Chief Engineer Ball pro
nounced the case as one of arson be
yon a question.
Shortly JWore 6 o'clock a Japanese
bath-house-keeper, next door to Dohr
mann'p. Raw sparks of fire in the rear
of the paint shop, as the flames had
slowly worked through a partition.
The Oriental called for help and while
several persons tried to quench the
brisk firp the department was called.
Breaking in the firemen found the
flames running through the rear, at
tacking floor, celling and studding. while
a mass of oil - soaked stuff was
briskly ablaze. Quick work checked
the flames before they were beyond
control. Then began an investigation
that disclosed a train of inflammable
stuff laid the full length of the store
along the floor and close to piles of
oil-filled cans, the stoppers of which
had been pulled. The fire train started
at a counter, where a large quantity
of varnish had been poured on the
floor. It ran toward the rear, with
gasoline-saturated wall paper and ex
celsior laid carefully to connect with
opened cans of gasoline. Two open
cans of vÂ».rnish formed one station on
the line. A few feet back of this was
a pile of oil-soaked waste paper, hid
ing a kerosene lamp full of oil, with
the receptacle open to feed the fire. A
pyramid of paint oil cans full of the
inflammable fluid set near the train,
while a pile of rags and '-loths. paint
soakefl, offerer! more food for the
flames.
The fire, which was started, in Chief
Ball's opinion, with a slow match, had
burned as far as the pyramid before it
was extinguished.
Dohrmann told Chief Ball he left
the shop at 8 o'clock yesterday after
noon. He carried $1500 insurance.
Therp wpre no explanations concerning
thp suspicious train of saturated waste
stuff. The block in which Dohrmann's
store is located has been the scene of
two fires a short time before that of
last night. One of the flres started at
the rear of a vacant store to the west
of th" paint shop. This was a sus
picious blazÂ«*. Thp other was at the
rear of Elliott's furniture store, corner
Brush find Seventh street, but Chief
Ball ascribed that one to carelessness
in storing kerosene oil.

increase in business since the close of
the rainy season.
The last week has been marked by a
steady increase in the building indus
try in Berkeley, and old residents of
the town say that more homes will be
built there this year than ever before
in the history of the community. This
increase in building means an equally
great increase in the sale of unim
proved property.

geles to-night, under arrest for at
tempting to assault Admiral Goodrich.

Starr for shirking in the use of his oar
and the sailor, becoming enraged, at
tempted to assault Goodrich. He was
quickly overpowered by the other

DISCUSS THE POOLROOM
EVIL IX THE SALOOXS
Foreman Andrews and President Po-
heim Confer With District At
torney Byington.
District Attorney Byington, Presi
dent Poheim of the Police Commis
sion and Foreman Andrews of the
Grand Jury were in conference yes
terday regardln- the poolroom evil.
President Poheim, in explaining the
present attitude of the commission
toward saloon-men on whose premises
pools are being sold, said that while
the commission was ready to assist
the Grand Jury In every possible way
to discourage the evil, he felt that
before any license were, revoked
proprietor* of saloons should be given
a chance to suppress the sale of pools
In the cigar-stands attached to their
places.
Poheim said a general revocation of
licenses would result in the ruination
of many saloon-men's business. He
did not think that proprietors of sa
loons should be held responsible for
any violation of the law on the part
of the cigar-man to whom they lease
part of their saloons, and It was
finally agreed that before any drastlo
measures were inaugurated the
saloon-men should be given a chance
to show their loyalty to law and or
der by prohibiting the selling of pools
by their tenants.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL. MONDAY. APRIL 10. 1905
FEARS FOR BOYS
OF THIS CITY
Ilev. Dr. F. W. Clampett
Discusses Environments
Which .Menace Youth of City
A CORRUPT COMMUNITY
Divine Calls on Americans to
Shoulder Responsibility
and to Rectify the Wrong
Dr. Frederick W. Clampett, rector of
Trinity Church, called upon several
hundred men in the Alhambra Theater
yesterday afternoon to be true to
themselves, to their city and their God.
He deplored the "environmens in this,
one of the most beautiful and fairest
of cities, which menace the youth, and
which, as a father of boys, filled him
with fear and alarm."
The subject of the lecture was "A
Message to Men," delivered in a manner
that held the attendance. It was given
under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.
and on the platform were many men
representing the clergy, the profes
sions and the commercial life of the
city.
Among them .were Dr. Francis M.
Larkin, the Rev. David Evans, Pro
fessor W. M. Searby, J. B. Whitney,
George B. McDougall, George Warren
Hooper. F. A. Rounds, John Tunni
cliffe, F. L. Turpin. H. J. McCoy, H.
W. Davis, William G. Quinlin, William
S. Wells, Isaac Penny, the Rev. Ernest
Bradley, rector of St. Stephen's
Church; W. W. Chase, Edward Cole
man, the Rev. K. Strong and the Rev.
Mr. Thomas.
Dr. Clampett impressed his hearers
with the necessity of possessing the
spirit of faith, since no life is com
plete and success not marked in those
who are without it. Materialism was
of this age. said the doctor, and there
were men who would not believe be
cause they could not see, and even the
doubtful might be found among pro
fessors of universities. The more, how
ever, that he dealt with men the more
he believed in "the great message."
It was following his allusion to temp
tations held out to men that the doc
tor brought "the corrupting conditions
that exist in this, one of the most beau
tiful, one of the fairest, cities in all
the world." "San Francisco," said Dr.
Clampett. "leads in impurity, while it
should be one of the purest cities In
all the land." He expressed his de
testation of the exhibition of vicious
cards in windows, of plays on the stage
which are so full of "innuendo" as to
be a menace to youth.
"There never was a city community
so rotten," he said, "as the city com
munity of to-day. Hence it is the
fluty of men and Americans to shoulder
the responsibility, and as individual
citizens right the wrongs."
Dr. Clampett held up the lamented
President William MeKlnley and Presi
dent Roosevelt as grand illustrations
of pure lives, instancing their home
living as beautiful examples to be fol
lowed.
And in this respect he spoke of the
marriage ties and pointed out with re
markable effect and force the respect
that 1p due to woman. He hoped that
everything: that man may say for good
mipht act as an influence upon his
neighbor. That was what they ought
tn try to attain â the personal influence
for good. He considered that such In
fluence was greater than any sermon.
He asHed that every man be worthy
of looking into the face of his mother,
or the wife or the little child whose
pv.Â»*t lips he touches; he beg-ged for
unselfishness in the spirit, so that
every man will remember the brother
who is down in the world and of the
outcast sister, and thus make this life
the sweeter and the stronger.
TEAMSTER IS ARRESTED
OX A ROBBERY CHARGE
Lee Wile. Who Alleges He Is a Cousin
of Rev. Dr. Pille, Vehemently
Denies Accusation.
Lee Dille was arrested yesterday
morningr on Sacrame*nto street, be
tween Montgomery and Kearny, by Po
liceman Engrel and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of robbery. The
complaining witness is John Carroll of
Colma, who alleges that Dille forcibly
took out of his hand between $2 and
$3 in silver. Dille vehemently denied
the charge and said that Carroll had
made a mistake. James Butler, who
was with Carroll, also said that a mis
take had been made, but Carroll was
insistent and the policeman had to
place Dille under arrest. When
searched at the City Prison no coin
was found in Dllle's pockets.
Dille is a teamster in the employ of
the Spring Construction Company of
Berkeley and lives there. He says he
ls a cousin of the Rev. Dr. E. S. Dille
ard that his father was a well-known
contractor in Oakland, who designed
and built the Oakland mole for the
Southern Pacific Company. He threat
ens to sue Carroll for damages. He
pointed out that half an hour elapsed
between the time of the alleged rob
bery and his arrest and it would have
been a simple thing for him to have
left the neighborhood if he had been
guilty.

WARNS AGAINST
DESECRATION
Minister Sees More Danger
in Baces and Sunday Show
Than in Big Immigration
ADVISES DELIBERATION'
Admits Statesmen Should
Wisely Consider Influx
of Aliens to This Laud
"Foreign Immigration and the Re
ligious Future of San Francisco" was
the subject of a sermon delivered last
night by the Rev. Frank L. Norton at
the First Baptist Church, Eddy street.
Mr. Norton referred to the rapidly
increasing immigration to the United
States, which he considered was oblit
erating the lines between the home
and the foreign mission work.
There may be perils in the increasing
foreign Immigration, which he admit
ted should have the wisest and the
most deliberate consideration of Amer
ican statesmen.
However, he feared that the greatest
peril to San Francisco was not the
foreign Immigration so much as the
race track, the desecration of the Sab
bath and the open theaters on Sunday.
There was no question as to the I
rapid development of San Francisco,
as the trend of American life was mov
ing westward, but with all the ma- i
terial prosperity the elements of i
strength In this city were those forces i
which make for righteousness. These
elements of strength, said Mr. Norton,
were "not the conspicuous things met ;
and seen on the street, but were like ;
the early disciples of the Lord, who |
were unnoticed by the ancient world |
yet were sowing seeds of modern civil- I
ization."
He said that the churches of San
Francisco were sowing the seed for the
city's future greatness.
The congregation was large and
deeply Interested in the sermon.
VIEW NATURE
AT PAVILION
Labor day at the exhibition of the
Forest, Fish and Game Association
drew a large crowd to the pavilion yes
terday. The exhibition supplied In
structive entertainment for those to
whom the fastnesses of the woods and
the allurements of outdoor life are
practically closed books, owing to the
toil that keeps them confined within
the* city. The day in the pavilion was
really an outing for hundreds of those
who attended. The call of birds, the
singing of the waterfall, the frisking
of deer, and over it all the balsom of
the pine and the spruce were a trans
portation to the health-giving fast
nesses of the Sierra.
That the day might not grow dull
for the visitors, there were provided
entertainment features not exactly
harmonious with the wilds of nature,
but nevertheless of great Interest.
There were tugs-of-war, boxing and
other athletic events that brought
cheers from the multitude. The music
was of the best. The bands of the
Hebrew Orphan Home and the Ancient
Order of Foresters played.
People who attend the exhibition
for the first time are surprised at what
they see there and say they did not
know there were so many Interesting
and beautiful features. The general
panorama of forest and mountain and
waterfall, with electric lights glowing
everywhere, ls a picture that pleases
and is received with exclamations of
delight.
The art gallery contains a great
number of pictures, many of them the
best work of the artists that produced
them. California woods, that won
medals at the St. Louis Fair are dis
played upstairs. Birds, fishes and
beasts are everywhere.
Besides the general display there are
every night some special features of
entertainment of a high class.
The attendance at the exhibition ls
increasing every day and it is destined
to be a great success, both as a show
and financially.

TRADE CONDITIONS STILL EXCELLENT.
EXPANSION in general trade during the first quarter of the
year, compared with the corresponding quarter in 1904, has
been so pronounced that commercial statisticians have inter
ested themselves in ascertaining about how much it was. Their
conclusions indicate a gain of from 5 to 15 per cent over the major
portion of the country, especially throughout the West. They are
affirmed by the continual increase in the bank clearings and the gain
of 9 per cent in railway earnings in March.
As already pointed out, the conditions thus far this year are just
the reverse of those at this time last year. Then we were steadily
losing: now we are as steadily gaining, and if the present ratio ot
increase continues throughout the remainder of 1905 it will prove a
banner trade year. The best of it is that it is legitimate. Specula
tion i* moderate, and very few new syndicates for the flotation of
vast enterprises are being formed. Their heyday has apparently
passed, though Wall-street operators report that a number are being
considered and will probably be consummated when the times again
become favorable for their exploitation.
At present the feeling in Wall street, while buoyant, is adverse
to booms and plunges, and though there is plenty of money to oper
ate with, there is little inclination to risk it recklessly. There is also
some deterrent in the form of a slight hardening in money rates dur
ing the past fortnight, which will prove highly beneficial if it re
strains any tendency toward a renewal of the wild financiering of two
or three years ago. In this connection the announcement is made
that Secretary Shaw intends during the next month or so to with
draw from nafional bank? about 25 per cent of the Government de
posits, amounting to about $20,000,000, the first installment to be
drawn about May 15 and the second about July 1. This withdrawal
will strengthen the Government reserve in the spring and early
summer, when funds are easy, and can be redeposited in the fall,
when the banks need money to move the crops. The result of this
new departure will be watched with interest. The money markets
throughout Europe and America continue well supplied with ready
fund?, hence this withdrawal is not expected to produce any de
rangement or stringency.
While the whole country is sending in excellent trade reports
the Pacific Coast is making an exceptionally fine showmg. The
exports from San Francisco in March were $6,833,700. compared with
$3.61 5.600 in March. 1904. and $4,056,000 in March, 1903, while those
lor the first quarter of 1005 were 5i 3.844.000. against $10,283,000 for
the first quarter of 1904. This gain will compare favorably with any
reported by other sections of the country. Indeed, the Pacific Coast
has been sending in the best reports of any section for some years,
hardly halting even when trade returns fell off from time to time in
the East. These continued excellent reports are attracting to the
coast a good deal of unemployed Eastern capital and thousands of
homeseekers from the Middle West, and are proving the best ad
vertisements of our prosperity.
Our crops last year were generally very good and passed out
of the farmers' hands with remarkable rapidity and at most excel
lent prices, hence we find ourselves approaching another abundant
harvest with no old stock on hand to keep prices down. This is al
ready shown by the reception given the new spring clip of wool,
which is going into consumption as fast as it is shorn, and at a
high plane of quotations : also by a steady demand for the coming
crop of hops and dried fruit, sale* of some kinds of the latter having
already been made to New York for July delivery at remunerative
quotations. As far as the present outlook for 1905 is concerned, Cali
fornia has certainly nothing to complain of.
Current statistics elsewhere continue highly favorable. The coun
try's bank clearings last week showed a gain in trade of 4^.7 per cent,
with Chicago the only important city to exhibit a loss, and this
was doubtless chic to the cessation of business on one day when
the city had a municipal election. The increase at Xew York was
73.5 per cent, and the gains at the other large cities were also pro
nounced. k
The staples present no new features worthy of especial com
ment. All seem more or less active and in good condition. Build
ing operations all over the country are brisk, with improving condi
bOM noted in the lumber and iron industries. The railroads have
all the freight the} can possibly handle, and from one end of the land
to the other activity in general business is still the order of the day.
INSPECTING IMPORTS.
THE Federal Government is looking into the purity of such im
ports- as enter into the diet of the people. Olive oil from the
Mediterranean countries has been long under suspicion, and in
vestigation proves .hat some of it grew under the bnsf'e.s of the
rooting and grunting American hog. The olive tree is associated
with religion, history and romance. It was the first to get out of
' water when Xoali was acting as the unlicensed skipper of the Ark.
In it> shade rested that most favored of audiences that ever listened
to human language, when the Sermon on the Mount gave to the
race it? highest ethics. Think of passing hog grease off for the fruit
of this noble tree! â¢
In some imported oil, also, there is found cotton seed, mustard
seed and peanut oil. These are edible oils, but they lack the fine
quality and the medicinal virtues of the pure oils. The Government
is now toping imported wines to find out how much gypsum, oak
tannin, aniline dye. salicylic and benzoic acid they carry, in order to
determine the fitness of these drinks for our stomachs' sake and our
often infirmities.
All this is well. We should not permit the wily foreigner to hit
us in the stomach with adulterated oil and poison wine. But recent
reports seem to show that as far as wines are concerned we need not
pine away for lack of dye stuff and mineral acids, unless the enter
prise of the domestic sophisticator is officially restrained. The
chemist of the San Francisco Board of Health finds everything in
mt of our bottled domestic wines from coal tar dye to arsenic.
We are surprised that all such wine when found by the Board of
Health was not immediately spilled into the sewer. There is as
much authority for doing that as there is for spilling swill milk. All
of such stocks of wine should be destroyed. The greed that seeks
profit by using poison in food or drink can be touched and admon
ished in one way only, and that is by inflicting a money loss.
When the peddlers of poison milk found their wagons met every
morning by such an energetic inspector as Dockery, who emptied
the cans in the gutter, dishonesty became unprofitable and honesty
was seen to be the best policy. Every drop of drugged wine or
liquor that is found by the board should go to the sewer. If there
be large wholesale stocks of such liquor so much the better. Destroy
them, and when a few adulterators have been bankrupted they will
have fewer imitators. At the same time, some organization having
the power should consider it a duty to patrol the wine industry of
California, lest it be hit a fatal blow by these adulterations.
ThÂ«re can be little doubt that Germany would hail with delight nerious
opposition to the Monroe doctrine. Indeed, if the United States should be
forced to abandon it Germany would profit by the result more than any
other country. â Memphis Commercial Appeal.

MR S. HENRY
8. NEW, wife
of the new
acting chairman of
the Republican Na
tional Committee,
is one of the social
leaders of Indian
apolis. Although
she does not open
her home for fre
quent entertain
ments, those she
gives are noted for
elegance. She is
one of the best
dressed women in
the city, says the
Philadelphia North
American's corre
spondent.
Mrs. New has
literary talent asj
well as social
ace omplishments. j
She is familiar*
with all the political work of her
husband. In fact, she has been hia
adviser in many Important matters,
but she hae always kept her own per
sonality in the background.
Mrs. New waa formerly Miss
Catherine McLean. Before her mar
riage she spent a year on the stage
as a singer, having previously de
voted several seasons to study in
New York. Her marriage cut short
fe career that would probably have
been artistically successful. A few
years ago Mrs. New published a book
of short stories under the title of "A
Woman Reigns."

BEATING GAS TRUST.
"Let me show you my new scheme
for beating the gas trust," said the act
reas housekeeper, leading the way to |
the kitchen, where the sas meter was
installed. On a shelf just over the
kitchen door was a bulky object
swathed in flannel. The flannel was
wet, and a pan underneath caught the
drippings.
"That's all there is to it," she said
triumphantly. "Just get an old petti
coat, soak it in water and wrap it j
around the meter. You will find that ]
your gas bill will be reduced by at
least one-half. Don't ask me the ex- I
p'anation of it; all I know is that the I
results are there.
"When 1 first took this flat my gas
bills were terrible. A friend told me to
try this wet-cloth plan, and now I burn |
Juet as much gas as before and at half
the expense. When the man comes to
inspect the meter I take off the cloth.
The cold-water treatment doesn't af
fect the mechanism, so far as I know, i
At any rate, the inspector makes no
complaint, and I am saving money."
BAD FOR DEBTORS.
The worst thing that can happen to |
a mati 'In Siam is to get into debt,
from which there is never any escape,
owing to the exorbitant interest
charged. Once in debt there is no ap
peal, the debtor being stripped of his
clothes and compelled to work In fet
ters, generally for the rest of his life,
to pay the interest. Drunkards are
not permitted to give evidence in the
law courts of Siam.

lieg-e lord will not have the courage to say what he
thinks.
But if she he timid she will probably quail and con
fess ignobly to her own misgivings. Whereupon she will
find herself the subject of a lecture which gives her hus
band an opportunity to voice the accumulated wisdom of
years concerning the *ln of blindly following fashion's
dictates.
"Haven't you any mind of your own? Haven't you
any taste of your own? You don't have to put a hide
ous thing on your head just because the milliner tells
you It's the fashion, do you?"
To all these questions, and more, the susceptible
one must listen in the miserable consciousness that there
is much justice in the allegations. And shp begins to
wonder if. after all. masculine judgment might not have
asily mastered the problem which at the milliner's ap
[m ared so hopelessly bewildering.
In defense of this misjudged and harassed creature
itnd all of her kind. I want to say a word to the men.
To you who in your masculine ignorance of condi

unswervingly your own individual taste, permitting no
one to dictate to you In your selection, to you who pass
witticisms on the absurdity of making a fruit orchard
or flower garden of one's head, and who wonder what
on earth possesses women to wear the freakish hats
they do, I simply have this to say: There isn't one of you
who could go through the ordeal a woman does when she

DO you wanf. t Â»> read the character
of the men and women with
whom you are brought in con
tact? Watch their eyes, head,
handshake and walk, and the matter be
comes simple as reading the first book
in your library, if you only observe
the rules laid down before -the Chicago
Credit M*>n's Association at the Great
Northern Hotel by Dr. Charles F.
Boger, who has made a ffudy of char
acter reading for sixteenVears, says
the Chicago Tribune.
If you follow Dr. Boger's recipe you
can tell almost at a glance the hidden
idiosyncrasies of character of any one
you meet.
Here are Dr. Boger's rules:
1. A man who presses his thumb on
the back of your hand when shakinsr
hands is liberal.
2. The man who never presses his
thumb against yours when hand
shaking is stingy, and the higher he
keeps his thumb the stingier he is.
3. A man who shakes hands with the
tips of his fingers only is not to be
trusted â he may pay one debt, but he
will never pay the second.

ROSICRUCIANSâ D. O. E., City. The
Rosicrucians were a sect of mystical
philosophers who appeared in Germany
in the fourteenth century, and again
early in the seventeenth century, and
occasioned much controversy. The
"Confessio Roseae Crucis," 1616, is at
tributed to Valentine Andreas. They
swore fidelity, promised secrecy and
wrote hieroglyphically and affirmed
that the ancient philosophers of Egypt,
the Chaldeans, Magi of Persia and
Gynosophiflts of the Indies taught the
same doctrine.

elects to purchase a hat and come out of it with a shred
of "individual Judgment" left.
You would succumb even sooner than woman does â
poor thing â for no man would have the patience to put
up the fight she does before she submits to the Inevitable.
The average man would cry. "Any old hat!" pay the bill,
and depart in a hurry before the milliner's argument
was half over.
Taste! Can you define it? The most elusive. In
tangible quality in all the category of human faculties.
No one knows to just what extent good taste may be the
Ecceptam-e of an already prescribed fashion.
Judgment! Why, one has no judgment. It would
seem, if one's inclination calls for a low hat framing the
face when "they" are wearing small hats perched high
upon the coiffure.
All this your unhappy wife, or sister, or sweetheart
discovers to her despair, and the upshot of the matter
is that she concludes to adjust her taste to the fashions
instead of trying to bring the fashions to her taste. She
reflects that one's taste in millinery may need to bÂ« edu
cated and that it is just as possible to cultivate a liking
for odd styles in hats as it ls to grow a love for Ibsen or
Wagner.
Beauty* and symmetry, she decides, are not absolute,
but relative qualities in which style is the determining
factor. The painful shock she first experienced in con
templating a grotesque creation of flowers and foliaff*
tilted low upon her nose is replaced gradually by admir
ation for the chic, smart effect produced.
It is all a question of adjusting one's ideas to the
requirements, as you, who perhaps now ridicule your
wife's selection, will dou". tiess learn.
You will fall in line after you have become accus
tomed to the hat and will pronounce it charming. And
when next season lolls round you will be ready to con
demn anything that would claim to supplant in your fa
vor the creation you formerly found so impossible.
and lifeless hand, which you have to

5. You can tell a liar as far as you
can see him by watching his eyelids.
If the eyelid cuts off the eve at the
outside corner, drooping over it. the
possessor is a stranger to the truth
and has only heard of veracity as a
word in the dictionary.
6. The persons who show white, all
the way around the eyeball are per
sons who prevaricate.
7. When a person's head is bisrsrer at
the back and sides than at the front
and top, the animal predominates over
the intellectual forces.
8. In judging women the essential
things to be observed are the Hds and
eyes â pay no attention even to powder
and rouge in your estimate of female
character. The woman with a thin
upper lip â like a streak of red, is not
only cold-heartea. but clammy.
9. If a woman's eyelid cuts off the
eye at the corner she is a liar like a
man with the corresponding eyelid.

around her eye she does not tell the

COMMENT UPON THEIR ACTS?
When They Pose as Creatures of Opinions
They Must Stand Criticism.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
he ultimate relationship of club
dom much of the childishness of women
is revealed, and not wholly to their dis
aovantag-eâif they could only see the
humor of it and profit thereby.
And herein is the comedy of the
thing.
The American woman has long en
tertained the idea that there is some
thing sacred in her personalityâ that
notives. worHs and actions, like
Lnoperor William's, are above and be
criticism: that women are not of
the human stuff of mhich men are
made, and therefore not amenable to
the laws of criticism and punishment
like them.
And under this unwritten law of "lesÂ«
majesty, " women have acquired a lib
erty of tongue that works more havoc
happiness than a year of Junes
could o'ercomÂ«.
Of course, it ail comes about logically
â as do all things that concern Gods
en For a good many centuries
men considered women merely as an
accessory to comfortable living â never,
never as an integral part of life. And
therefore were women never taken
more seriously than we take a little
five-year-old to-day.
What opinions they expressed were
ir.auigfcnuy emiied at and dismissed â
they were never analysed and criti-
cited, simply because they were
"women's opinions." And thus has the
habit grown upon us not to expect
cntidsm and to resist it when it comes.
And cow that we have outgrown our
swaddling clothes â thanks to educa-
tional opportunities â have acquired
the rudiments of reason, of which we
prate so much, we must be willing to
stand the tests by which men are
measuredâ that is, if we insist upon
the world taking us seriously. Sisters,
it is high time we got over the ridicu
lous notion that we are Sacred Ibises
and immune to the words of the pro
fane. . .>"*
If we thrust opinions forth, let them
etand upon their merits, and not upon
their sex.
If we lose our tempers in discussion,
let us not grow cross when we're told
of it.
If our neighbor's opinion doesn't jibe
with ours, let us not fly to the verdict
that the woman is offering us insult
that she opposes the measures Just be
cause she opposes us. And that is Just
the thing we â and we all know it,
but many of the Sacred Ibises scorn to
admit it. "It makes us ridiculous, don't
you know, In the eyes of men." Pshaw!
As though the men didn't know that
we aren't not all Minervas, Portias and
Griseldas. They've known It a good
many centuries.
And herein is the comedy of the
thing â club women take themselves bo
seriously!
Why this diatribe?
Well, there are a few of us who are
Sherlock Holxneses enough tor know.

"So I quit coffee, and tried tea and at

A BITTER ONE
Xon-Partisan Nominees for
Office in Raisin City Mak

POLITICAL EXPERIMENT
Charter Is Responsible for
Queer Conditions Surround
ing Municipal Election
Special Dispatch to Tb* Call.
FRESNO. April 9. â A municipal
election will be held in Fresno to
; morrow under conditions unlike any
', others which prevail in the State of
California, or for that matter, any
< where on the Pacific coast. No party
, nominations have been made for any
| of the offices, but there are four can
didates in the field for Mayor and two
â  or more for every other office in the
gift of the people. All the candidates
appear upon the official ballot as "In
dependent nominees." Nevertheless,
three of the four candidates for May
or were nominated by a caucus of
citizens representing peculiar inter
' esta. There is a vigorous contest for
i the Mayorallty between these three
and to-nigrht, on the eve of election,
it is conceded by all that the race will
j be close, with no odds in favor of any
! one of the three. Thousands of dol
lars have been spent In the campaign
and open air rallies of extraordinary
dimensions have been held. The air
has been so full of personal vituper
. ation that former close friends have
1 become enemies.
The four candidates for Mayor are
I* O. Stephens. W. Parker Lyon, John
A. Neu and Robert Lochead. The
first three are^ well-to-do business men
and the fourth a carpenter. The race
is between Stephen?, Lyon and Loch
ead. The last named was nominated
by the Fresno labor unions and is con
sidered by both of his opponents to
be a strong antagonist. Stephens is a
candidate to succeed himself. He
has the support of both the Daily Re
publican and the Daily Democrat.
Stephens is a Democrat and the most
peculiar feature of the whole situa
tion is that he wag placed in the field
through the efforts of Chester H.
Rowell. editor of the Republican, who
was his opponent in the election
which took place four years ago. The
spectacle of a Republican editor nom
inating and engineering the campaign
of a Democrat who had previously
: defeated him in a race for office is
rare.
CHARTER RESPONSIBLE.
The peculiar conditions which ob- |
tain in the present campaign arise
' from a peculiarity in Fresno's charter.
Fresno has not been classed by the
Legislature with any other munici
pality In the State. Her charter is
unique in many particulars, one being
the legal abolition of partisanshiD in
municipal elections. A large percen
tage of the smaller towns of the State
have non-partisan elections, but with
the partial exception of Ban Jose,
where there is a temporary abolition '
of partisan elections, there is no other
city on record where there is absolute
legal abolition of the nomination of
men by parties and the placing of
names on the ticket under party
heads. Indeed, for Fresno it is an
experiment.
The non-partisan clause in the city t
charter was inserted In the present
year and was passed up to the Legis
lature barely in time to receive -ts
indorsement before adjournment.
It was opposed by many prominent
local citizens and the statement has
been freely made that the " amend
ment was inserted by politicians who
believed that they could not control ,
the present election by any other
means. Be that as it may, the cen
tral committees of the Various politi
cal parties met immediately after the |
amendment became a law and de
cided not only to live up to the letter
but also the spirit of the law. Then
followed the various movements
which were made for the purpose of
capturing the city government in the
cause of divergent interests.
The first man in the field for Mayor ,
was Sam B. Toombs. a street con- ;
tractor. Three weeks before the |
election he realized that he had no i
chance and withdrew in favor of thf ;
labor candidate.
The next man in the field was L. O. !
Stephens, the incumbent. Sephens has |
been in office four years and in that ]
time has initiated many reforms, j
Among o-ther moves he influenced the
i Board of Trustees to raise all saloon ;
' licenses. He pushed through the 1 '
o'clock closing ordinance and rescinded j
the licenses of all the saloons In the i
; tenderloin district. Through his efforts j
the redlight district was regulated and
its habitues kept within bounds.
MARKS MAXY ENEMIES.
Stephens made many enemies, and it !
remained for the editor of the Republi- !
can paper to persuade him to be a can- ',
didate to succeed himself.. Editor i
Rowel] then engineered a "Non-parti- j
san" convention which duly nominated !
his candidate. The Fresno Democrat
at first opposed the candidacy of j
Stephens, but afterward decided to fall
in line, and it now supports him.
Stephens is the leading Undertaker of
Fresno.
W. Parker Lyon is a rich furniture
dealer who is extremely active in fur- !
thering his interests in the campaign, j
John A. Neu is a proprietor of a '
music house. He has no special inter- |
eats behind him.
Robert Lochead is the only candidate !
who has not been maligned in the cam
paign. Lochead leads a ticket noml- i
nat^d by a caucus of delegates Â»V.ted :
by all the Fresno labor unions. The
nomination came at the close of a fight
which has been waged here in the
building trades. Three-fourths of the I
unions of this city have voted to lay j
off labor on election day and work for i
the success of the labor ticket. The j
daily papers claim that money has been I
received from the Schmitz contingent
in San Francisco to be used in the con- j
test, the understanding being that in I
case of the success of the Lochead j
ticket, the union labor influence will :
be used to boom Schmitz for the Gov- j
ernorship two years hence. Reports i
are also current that stutters have been â 
brought here from San Francisco to j
assist In the election of the Lochead
ticket
The contest for the office of Police
Judge is even more' bitter and more
fiercely waged In some quarters than
the fight for Mayor. The fight is rather
against the incumbent, David Cos
grave, than in favor of any one of the
other candidates Cosgrave is a candi
date on the "Stephens ticket," but is not
supported by the Fresno Democrat. An j
Infernal machine, composed of gun- !
cotton and fulminating powder, re
ceived last Thursday by George Cos
grave, brother to David, as announced
in the dispatches, is supposed to have
been intended for the Police Judge.

PLEASANT PASTIMES
ENLIVEN THE WEEK
YOUNGER SET LEADS AfTAIRS
Weddings Continue With Others in Prospect
Quiet joy characterizes the tone of
social affairs. All events are more than
tinged with genuine pleasure, although
there is little of hilarity or overenthu
siasm. The house parties are mainly in
the hands of the younger people, who
continue to dance, sing and play games
regardless of season or temperature."
Several pretty weddings, noticeable for
absolute lack of display, have taken
place, while the prospect for others
soon to follow is very rich.

â¢ Absolutely Confidential and Free
, There can be no more terrible ordeal
j to a delicat^, sensitive, refined woman
â¢ than to be obliged to answer certain
questions in regard to her private ills,
] even when those questions are asked
â¢ by her family, physician, and . many
m^S^^yj^^^ p^^ f^âjA^^U^^^^f
continue to suffer rather than submit
to examinations which- so many physi-
cians propose in order to intelligently
treat the disease ; and this is the rea-
son why so' many physicians fail to
â  cure female disease: -: " â¢ ; -
This is also the reason why thousands
upon thousands of women are corre-
sponding' with Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn,
Mass. To her they can confide every
detail- of their illness, and from
her great knowledge, obtained from
years of experience in treating female
ills.' Mrs. Pinkham can advise women
I more wisely than the local physician.
: Read how Mrs. Pinkham helped Mrs.
T. C. Willadsen; of Manning. la. She
writes : -
Dear Mrs. Pinkham:â "
â¢ "I can truly say that you have saved my
life, and I cannot express my . gratitude in
words. Before I wrote to you telling you
how I felt, I had doctored for over two years
steady, and spent lots of money in medicines
besides, but it all failed to do me any good. I
had female trouble and would daily have faint-
ing spells, backache, bearing-down pains, and
my monthly periods were very irregular and
finally ceased. I wrote to you for your ad-
vice and received a letter full of instructions
fust what to do. and also commenced to take
Lydia E. Pmkham's Vegetable Compound,
and I have been restored to perfect health.
Had it not been for you I would have been in
my grave to-day.''
\ Mountains of proof establish the fact
' that no meaicme in the world equals
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound for restoring women's health.

HORNETS BEAT
VAMPIRE TEAM
In the semi-final round for the Cali
fornia Association Football Union cup
thf Oakland Hornets beat the Vam
pires by the narrow margin of one goal
yesterday on the Presidio athletic
grounds. The game was keenly con
tested throughout, the players being in
clined to be rough and quarrelsome.
Captain Mackenzie of the Oakland Hor
nets offended seriously in this respect,
the fullbacks of the Vampires being
the special objects of his attacks. In
the first half hour of play the Vam
pires obtained one goal, kicked by
Ramsden from a scrimmage in front of
the net. At half time the score stood:
Vampires, 1 goal; Oakland Hornets. 0.
In the second period the play was
even, though the Vampire goalkeeper
had to save some dangerous shots
from the Hornet forwards. In the last
few minutes the Hornets put the ball
into the net, the referee allowing the
goal against the protest of the Vam
pires. At the call of time the game
was a draw. Two extra periods of fif
teen, minutes .each were played to de
cide the match. In the first of these
the Hornets scored a goal, so the match
ended 2 goals to 1 in their favor.
In thÂ« last quarter of an hour. the Hor
nets played with four halfbacks, ' ren
dering the task of the Vampire for
wards a hard one. A fair number of
spectators watched the game. The
teams lined up as follows: . ,

Uncle tossed out a double-decker yes
terday to the baseball huskies. Both
games were easy for his tribe, but they
had to play baseball to get away with
them. Jimmy Whalen, the shut-out
kid, rolled up a total of forty-two
spasms without a run by blanking
Portland in the afternoon game. Scores:
Morning gameâ San Francisco 19, Port
land 3; afternoon gameâ San Francisco
2, Portland 0.
Whalen was the most talked about
man on the lot. Every one was shout
ing the praises of Jimmy. As the in
nings pieced and the Husks did not
come through the fans. would figure out
the dope and count up the total innings
in which James had held his opponents
at bay. If Jimmy can go seven rounds
more he will break the world's record,
which was made by Wiggs in the
Northwest League more than three
years ago.
The tale of the game hangs on the
work of Whalen. He had everything at
his command, and every batsman who
faced him was buffaloed. Up to the
ninth spasm the best the Husks got
was two hits. They tore off another
pair at the final rally, but Eddie House
holder could not kick in with one when
he came to bat. so the game ended.
Portland played high art ball till the
eighth round, when the team seemed to
take an upward flight. It could easily
be noticed that Mr. Jones weakened a
trifle, and his fielders did. not seem to
care whether the game lasted one in
ning or a hundred. McLean was tipped
on the mitt by a foul, which hurt him
some. After that he let the base run
ners steal as they might without try
ing to peg to the bt c.
Wheeler was the iife-saver for Uncle.
He opened the eighth with a drive over
Householder's head, good for two
sacke. Spencer dumped one down to
Atz and beat the throw to the bag.
Along came Hildebrand with a fly to
Householder, which let the graceful
Georgie register without panting. Spen
cer went to second on the throw and
came- through when Joe Nealon punched
a 6tiff one out to short center fleld.
The fans never saw a better exhibi
tion than the Seals put up In the fleld.
Every man did what was expected of
him, and some went even further.
Gochnauer cut off four sizxlers that
looked like hits on any man's ball fleld.
Wheeler played a swell game at sec
ond. Charley Irwin and Spencer ate up
a few chances which started the multi
tude yelling and provoked a hat-throw
ing panic. The score:

HONORB EVEN AT IDORA PARK.
Oakland and Seattle Balltossers Each
Take a Game.
OAKLAND, April 9.â lt was an even
break at Idora Park to-day In the two
baseball games played by the Siwashes
and the Commuters. Seattle captured
the morning contest by a score of 9 to
2, while the Oaklands were returned the
victors In the matinee performance, the
board reading 5 to 1 when the curtain
came down- Hogan was sent to the
firing line for the Oaks in the forenoon
fray and twirled pluckiiy despite the
punctured support accorded him by his
playmates, jvho did the wrong thing
eleven times. Franks and Streib were
the arch offenders, each earning three
â errors. Buck tangled his tootsies up
with ground balls like a knockabout
Juggler, and Dutch Julie allowed
throws to"t>ass through him as if he
were a Junnel. Hogan was batted for
seven safe ones and transported four
Commuters to Station One on passes.
He connected solidly with the sphere
and sent Oswald home with a clean
drive to left center in the seventh ses
sion. The Siwashes tallied once In the
first, once in the second, twice in the
fifth and In the ninth started a war
dance around the trails that netted
them five more runs. Charley Hall of
ficiated in the box for Chief Rubs Hall's
warriors and was batted for five
blngles.
William Moskimon, M. D., was sum
moned by the Oaks to prescribe for the
Siwashes In the afternoon battle and
he doped and duped the savages badly.
The palefaces from the Northern
Reservation were able to see clearly
but two ft the pills the physician rolled
up near "he plate and an orphan tally
was all they harvested after swinging
at the doctor's capsules for nine rounds.
In the meantime Dr. Moskimon and his
assistants operated on the Indians for
a half dozen runs. Acting Captain
Billy Dunleavy wag to the fore with
his trusty club at opportune occasions
and walloped Left Winger Henderson
for a pair of two-sackers. In the
initial frame Dun. wltii a double,
chased home King and Francks, who
had been generously passed by Hender
son. In the fifth Billy swatted again
for a brace of bags and Francks regis
tered. Henderson was unsteady and
was soaked when soaks were needed.
Kane, as usual, conducted himself
brilliantly around the third corner and
saved his tribesmen from a shutout by
sending Houtz in with a three-sacker
in the eighth section. Jimmy Byrnes
went into action this afternoon after a
week's illness and Captain Rip Van
Haltren awoke from a long Bleep and
appeared on the grounds in plain
clothes. He has been indisposed for a
week, but expects to lead his men
against Portland for a series of seven
games next week. Scores:

Baseball at San Jose.
SAN JOSE, April Â».â ln one of the
closest and most exciting games ever
played on a San Jose diamond the
home team won from Lodi this after
non by the score of 4 to 2. The result
was In doubt until the end of the ninth
inning. The San Jose nine waa
strengthened by the addition of Rus
sell, Frank Arrel lanes and Zamlock of
Oakland. In the local team the pitch
ing of Elmer Emerson, who allowed
only iflve hits, the stick work of Walters
and the fielding of Russell and Arrel
lanes were features. Both teams played

BAKERS CLINCH
HOLD ON CUPS
The handicap doubles tennis tourna
ment commenced on the Golden Gate
Park courts last Sunday was com
pleted yesterday down to the finals.
The two teams left in the competition
are the Baker brothers (owe 15 3-6) and
Fred Adams and Guy Lytton (scratch)
The Baker brothers have won the cups
twice, and unless Adams and Lytton
beat them next Sunday the trophies
that have been up for more than three
years will go to the park champions
for ail time.
What was expected to prove an ex
tremely close and interesting match
waa that between the Baker brothers
and Herbert Long and George Janes.
These teams met two weeks ago and
an excellent match resulted, the ver
dict going to Long and Janes by a
small margin. The same teams met
yesterday, and aa before on even
terms. The Bakers outplayed their op
ponents from start to finish. The Cali
fornia Club representatives at no stage
of the game had a chance to win. Long
and Janes play in streaks and unless
they are gdod they make a miserable
showing. The Baker brothers were aa
steady as usual and made few errors.
The score was 6-5, Â«-2.
Carl Gardner and Melville Long, an
other California Club team that looked
to have all the best of the handicap
ping, went out in straight sets. They
won their first match, beating the
Howell brothers. Deaplte the fact that
Gardner and Long allowed Adams and
Lytton the small handicap of owe 3-6,
the former could not even win a set.
Adams and Lytton won by a score of
6-3 6-3. The winners kept up their
good work, beating Hotchkiss and Ga
briel in the semi-finals. Again they
received odds of owe 3-6 and again
they won with ease. The score was
6-3. 6-1.
The semi-final match of the indoor
tournament was played yesterday on
the park courts and resulted In a vic
tory for Charles Dunlap and OharlÂ«
Foley. The latter were expected to
win easily, but/ they had to put forth
their best efforts to beat J. R. Lewis
and E P. Finnegan. The latter won
the first set, but their opponents took
the next two. * The score was 5-7, 6-3,
9-3.
Carl Gardner and Harry Wolfe will
meet to-night in Mechanics' Pavilion
In the semi-nnals of the singles. The
winner will play George Janes on
Wednesday night. The finals of the
doubles will also be played on Wednes
day night. The contestants will be
Harry Rolfe and Herbert Schmidt and
Charles Dunlap and Charles Foley. On
Thursday night the Hardy brothers
and Percy Murdock and Grant Smith
will play an exhibition doubles.

to Appear in
This City.
After all, the test of "Florodora" lies
in the rendition of the double sextet,
"Tell Me, Pretty Maiden." If this is
well done the pretty comic opera is a
success; if poorly done. It is a failure.
And "Florodora," on this week at the
Tivoli, Is a success. This means that
the double sextet is cleverly done.
The piece opened at the Tivoli last
night. The big theater was crowded
from orchestra to gallery, an evidence
that the popularity of "Florodora" has
not departed, and those that went en
joyed a full measure of entertainment.
More statuesque maidens never sang
the double sextet song before, and the
voices and appearance of the "gentle
strangers" were well In keeping.
Gowned in imperial yellow, -with picture
hats of black, the maidens lent a flash
of color to a scene that leaves naught
but pleasant memories.
And the incongruity of the plot of the
piece is forgotten in the delight that
comes with the artistic rendition of the
songs scattered through its length that
have become "melodies of the home.
"The Queen of the Philippine Islands,"
sung by Aida Hemmi, who took the
part of Dolores, was well received, and
Grace Palotta won much favorable
comment by the manner in which she
handled the songs "When I Leave
Town" and "Tact," admitted by sing
ers to be exceedingly difficult.
Willard Simms assumed the role of
Tweedlepunch, a character calling for
great versatility, and he was not want
ing in ability to develop its best fea
tures. Teddy Webb as Gilfain, pro
prietor of the island and the perfume
of Florodora. carried out his part well.
The chorus generally is pretty and
well trained, and barring one or two
little slips, the inevitable experience of
a first night, the piece went off well
and promises to be one of the suc
cesses of the Tivoli comic opera season.
Theatergoers who thronged the Or
pheum last night had the pleasure of
witnessing a Juggling act by Paul Con
chas that has never been equaled here
in Its line. Conchas' specialty is Jug
gling cannon balls, big gun shells and
other warlike articles, whose weights
run into the hundreds of pounds. His
work is more than marvelous and he
winds up by catching a volley of can
non balls on his neck. He is assisted
by a queer-looking individual, who
says never a word, but is nevertheless
funnier by far than many of the al
leged humorous ones that frequently
make their way to this town.
Winona Shannon and Frank C.
Campbell have a little sketch that Is
worth going to see. Mlsb Shannon Is as
tough a girl as ever essayed to play a
tough part. She Bays many clever
things and kept the house in an uproar
while she was on the stage. Jack Mason
and his society belles made quite a hit
and got the glad hand of welcome from
the crowd. George Boniface and Ber

On March 30 last, at the old CamuloÃ
ranch house, made famous by Helen
Hunt Jackson's beautiful story "Ra
mona," Senora Ysabel Varelo del Valle.
one of the few remaining representa
tives of the old Spanish families of
early days in California and widow of
Don Ygnacio del Valle, one of the
wealthiest and most prominent of
Spaniards of his time, passed away.
Her life among the hills that she loved
so well, her devotion to her race, of
which she was nearly the last resident,
was beautiful.
She it was that inspired the character
of Senora Moreno in the beautiful story
of Ramona, which is to be presented
here by Miss Virginia Calhoun and
company at the Grand Opera-house,
beginning the week of April 16. Senora
del Valle, whose son. R. F. del Valle,
was the prototype of Felipe, another
strong character in the book and
dramatization, had never left the old
ranch-house which had been her home
for many years.
Miss Calhoun, who is now appearing
with great success In her own dramati
zation of this well-known story in
Southern California, is of the distin
guished California family of Calhouns.
For the last few years she has been
appearing in England with signal suc
cess, and it looks now that in the
California drama 6he is to achieve
much success.

GRAPPLES WITH
BOLD BURGLAR
A thrilling fight took place last night
shortly after 8 o'clock at the home of
H. G. A. Railton, auditor of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, at 1033 Do
lores street. Railton encountered two
burglars as he entered his residence.
He grappled with one of them, but the
fellow finally managed to make his
escape, carrying with him a valuable
gold watch and chain and $6 in coin.
Railton left his home shortly after
6 o'clock to call on some friends.
The other members of the family were
also out, leaving the house deserted.
Railton returned home a little after 8
o'clock and was startled to encounter
tw-o men in the hallway.
The burglars were taken entirely by
surprise and started to run for a near
by window. Railton gave chase and in
the meantime called out for assistance.
One of the men reached the window
and Jumped to the ground, but Rail
ton caught hold of the other.
Then a desperate fight ensued. The
thug struggled fiercely to get away,
while Railton held him fast, doing his
best to pinion the fellow to the floor.
The latter, however, was quick and
agile and after struggling with his cap
tor for several minutes finally man
aged to free himself and jump through
the open window.
Railton made a search of the prem
ises and discovered that a valuable
gold watch and chain and $6 in coin
were missing. The two intruders were
evidently on their way to ransack the
other rooms of the house when Rail
ton appearffl on the scene. Railton
doÂ£s not think either man was armed,
for neither made a motion to draw a
weapon.
Railton notified the police at the
Mission station. He gave a good de
scription of the two bold burglars.
The officials think the men are the
same who have been operating in the
Mission district with so much success
of late.
