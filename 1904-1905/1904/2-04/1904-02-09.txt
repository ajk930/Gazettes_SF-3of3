JAPAN TORPEDO BOATS ATTACK A RUSSIAN FLEET
AND THREE OF THE CZAR'S WARSHIPS ARE DAMAGED
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 9. â An official dispatch received here says
that Japanese torpedo boats have attacked the Russian squadron in the outer
roads at Port Arthur and that three Russian ships were damaged.
yJtPJZW'S warlike
activity leaves no*
question now that the
nation's clash with
Russia has already
begun. Japanese
troopships have land*
ed forces at various
ports in IQorea under
cover of the guns of
a torpedo flotilla. Jin
attack is to be made
on Seoul, and wan
ships of the Japanese
navy are to steam to
Port J^rthur and bom*

of the Russians. It is
reported that the

LONDON, Feb. 9.â In a dis
patch from Tokio a correspondent
of the Daily Mail says the Jiji
Shimpo has received a 'telegram
from Fusan, Korea, declaring
that the firing of guns was heard
to the east of Koje Island (about
twenty-five miles southwest of Fu
san) at 8 o'clock Saturday morn
. ing.
The Chefu correspondent of
the Daily Mail cables that six
Japanese transports arc landing
troops at various ports in Korea
from Masampho and Fusan, on
the south of Kunzan, Mokpho ard
Chemulpo, on the west.
Seoul is to be occupied and the
landing is being covered by tor
pedo divisions. The main body
of the Japanese fleet, the corre
spondent concludes, will s: A in the
direction of Port Arthur.
The Paris correspondent of the
Daily Mail says France has agreed
v.iih other powers to land troops
in China directly hostilities be

of the middle kingdom.

feature of his illness, continues. He had

The physicians say it is a case of
waiting for the disease to run its

fact that the Senator Is of a long-lived

SNOW AND ICE GIVE VIGOR
TO LIFE IN WASHINGTON
> *
Ca'ifornian Uses Photographs to Show Citizens
of the Capital Startling Comparisons in
Weatherâ Korea's Mysterious M in ister to Leave
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8.â Not forget
ting to mention the weather In the gen
eral discussion, It should be said, that
Washington, that may be bv many
supposed to stand in the Southern belt,
has been enjoying an uninterrupted
"season of skating for nearly three
months. There has^een excellent sleigh
ing for the past week, and during cer
tain afternoons Pennsylvania avenue
has witnessed as brilliant 'and exciting
scenes as are offered by the streets of
Ottawa with her winter carnivals.
Perhaps It is to secure the advantage
of these conditions by way of offering
a sharp contrast that A. H. Heber of
Los Angeles has been in the city dur
ing the week showing photographs of
wonderful vegetation in what has been
named the Imperial Valley, in San
Diego County, California, on ground
that two years ago, he declares, was
waste and worthless desert land.
The change was wrought by
irrigation, the result of the dig
ging of some 500 miles of ditches,
through which water from the Colorado
River now flows. His visit here is to
secure some legislation, and he has been
endeavoring* to enlist the aid of the
California delegation.
The effect of water on the desert in
the production of immense crops of
grain, alfalfa, maize, etc., with aid of
the summer and winter sunshine of
Southern California, Is very difficult of
belief to^the legislator from any other
part of the country, says Mr. Heber,
and requires an unwavering front and
plenty of evidence to convince.
DIPLOMAT'S CHILDREN REVEAL.
Before getting entirely away from
the weather it may be interesting to
note how the children of the Chinese
Minister and others of the legation
are enjoying it â coming as they do
from the sunniest sections of the
flowery empire. Arlu Liang-Cheng,
the Minister's youngest son, celebrated
his ninth anniversary a few days ago.
giving a party to which the legation
children were invited, together -with a
lot of American children, distinguished
In diplomatic and official life. The
Minister has a sumptuous home at
2001 Nineteenth street â and the party
had a sumptuous as well as a strenu
ous time. Or perhaps it was the elders
that had a strenuous time.
Not counting the Americans there
were in the party Ardee and Arlu, the
Minister's sons, aged 11 and 9; Ah
Yung, the Minister's nephew, aged 9;
Bernie Yung Kwai, aged 7, son of the
first secretary of the legation, and
Bernic-'s two little sisters, Elizabeth
and Gertrude, aged 5 and 4.
The distinctive feature of the cele
bration was the presentation of sleds
to the members of the party and the
fun they had in the house was only
preliminary to the fun they had in the
snow outside later on". This is merely
to show that all the merriment among
the children of Washington is not
limited to the boys at yie White
House. These latter, , by the way,
have been largely engaged these days
In snowballing the distinguished folks
who come and go at the Executive
Mansion.
But if life at the home of {he Chi
nese Minister is relieved by the riot
of childrenâ where it might not be ex
pected to be â It is distinctly different
with Korea. One excellent reason for
this is that there are no children there.
For a long time past, for reasons that
may be well understood by those who
read the dispatches under St. Peters
burg, Seoul and Tokio dates, the house
of the Korean Minister has been un
der surveillance, so to speak, by the
newspaper contingent of Washington.
KOREA IS A PUZZLE.
But it has been mighty small pick-
Ings with which Uhey have been re
warded. The Korean Minister and his
diplomacy have been, the first a sphinx
and the latter a mystery to everything
and everybody In Washington. His
name is Minhui Cho, but it is. doubtful
If he would tell you afe much If you
asked him. His gray house is in what
Is known as Iowa Circle, but no one
passes its portals. It is a somewhat
humiliating cohfession in hewspaper
dom, for many of Its best have tried.
Whether the Minister is here as an of
ficial exponent of hermit life or wheth
er .It is an individual characteristic
with Minhui Cho. the diplomatic corps
is unable to answer. '
Cho called &t the State Department
the other day and Assistant Secretary
Loomis saw him for the first time. No
body is certain as to what he said on
this occasion. He cannot speak English
and his interpreter cannot interpret
him. This is perhaps the real reason
of his seclusion. He is packing up pre
paratory to a return to his own coun
try and is soon to be succeeded by Yl
Kum Sang, at an uncertain date. If

Representative J. N. Gillette of Hum
boidt County has renewed an acquaint
ance In the person of Representative
Esch of La Crosse. Wis., whom he has
not met since tys schoolboy days. The
two went to school together at Sparta,
Wis., their teacher being Miss Anna E.
Smith. In the pleasure of their meet
ing and the discussion of their boy
hood escapades and the devious roads
by which they had traveled from the
Wisconsin town to a meeting place on
the floor, of the House of Representa
tives it was developed that their teach
er. Miss Smith, is also under the roof
of the Capitol, or at least under a roof
in the Capitol, being a clerk in the In
terior Departmentâ the only clerk in
the service of the Government, it Js
said, who may boast two full-Hedged
members of Congress among her former
pupils.
The petition of the Northern Cali
fornia Indian Association, submitted
to Congress a few days ago, has met
with prompt and vigorous opposition
by the authorities at the Carlisle
School. Senator Bard presented the
petition and at his instance it was
printed for the information of Con
gress.
APPEAL FOR INDIANS.
The petitioners beseech Congress to
grant lands in severalty to some thou
sands of landless and homeless .In
dians in Northern California, substan
tially as has been done for Indians not
only in other parts of California out
in other States. The petition or # pro
test of the Carlisle School is signed
by twenty-four persons, who have
been in the Indian service fromâ 5lie
year to thirty-nine years.
The protest declares that the wide
distribution in small communities of
the California Indians referred to
places them far in advance of any In
dians in the United States in point of
advantage for self-support, civilization
and assimilation with other people.
The protest further urges that poverty
is a good thing and is not confined in
its blessings to the Indians, as many
white people enjoy its advantages,
which "stimulates healthy effort. It
would be quite as just and proper for
the General Government," says the
protest, "to ? do for them (the white
people) what the California society
asks to be done for the Indians, and
the pauperizing results would be
the same. * * â¢ Whatever the
condition of the California Indians
without land may be, they are in
finitely more fortunate than those in
Oklahoma and elsewhere' who are
heavily landed, and, therefore,
through their unearned resources,
borne down by idleness and its destroy
ing influences, exaggerated through
the usual demoralizing frontier condi
tions." ' M "
The N'orthenjhCalifornia Indian As
sociation would seem to have met
something going in the opposite direc
tion.
Speaker Cannon has revived one of
the old blue laws of the Capitol and
it is no longer permissible to smoke
on the floor of the House. There Is
considerable fretting under the rule,
but the Speaker says he suffers as
much as any and more than most by
its enforcement. Either the rule is
good or it Is not and untfl it is re
pealed by the House there shall be no
smoking and the sergeant at arms and
assistants to the doorkeeper will see
to 'it. On the Senate side there is no
smoking allowed, even in the elevators
or lobbies.
Collector of Customs D. H. Jarvis
and Deputy Collector J. H. Causten of
Alaska are in the city to confirm the
report as to the deplorable effects of
the mere presence of the white man in
Alaska upon the destiny of the native
Eskimo, to say nothing of his unfortu
nate legislation at the seat of gbvern
ment. The officers say that the tribes
of Eskimos and Aleuts, once so numer
ous, have been reduced to not to ex
ceed 4000, chiefly by destitution result
ing from driving 1 away the fish and
game upon which they subsisted, and
especially by the game laws, which
prevent them from killjng seals as they
need them. Some remedy is demanded
if the tribes are not to be wiped out.
WOMAN WITH A CLAIM.
Mrs. Lena Walton of Nome is in the
city to prosecute a claim before the Su
preme Court for the ownership of claim
No. 19, on Ophir Creek. Alaska, which
she says is worth $1,000,000 and which
is also claimed by and is In the posses
sion of Charles D. Lane and the Wild
Goose Mining Company. Mrs. Walton
says she is known' in the northern
country as the Hetty Green of Alaska.
She Is stopping at the Raleigh and
claims to have every confidence In the
result of her suit here, although she
was worsted by the courts of Alaska.
The recent arrest of Delegate Kal
arslanaole of Hawaii in a street row
and his being required to appear before
a police court has revived the old ques
tion as to how far the members of the
two houses o* Congress are immune
from arrest. The question Is not be
ing discussed In Congress, to be sure,
but in the newspapers and , the cloak
rooms. Delegate Kalanlanaole refused
to put up the $5 required as collateral,
preferring to spend the night In a cell.
Upon his making the public claim
afterward before the court that he was,
as a- delegate to Congress, immune,
the case "was dropped.
The mileage which occu
pied the House for several days and
resulted in a unanimous vote to cut
the paragraph out of the appropriation
bill is expected to be revived In the
Senate when the bill comes up there
and many Democrats are hopeful that
the Republican majority will reinsert
it at that time, but v Republican Sen
ators* are generally quoted as saying
â¢'We'll fool 'em"â or more dignified
words to the same effect. The scene
at the taking of the vote on the para

House was an exciting oneâ there be

were crowded^ The result' was looked

and Receives 'Knife Thrusts
GRANTS PASS, Or., Feb. S.â While
attempting to arrest Ed Chiles on the
street here this afternoon John Patrick.
Chief of Police, was stabbed four or
five times in the side and breast and
cannot live. Chiles is a young fellow,
some "3 years of age, and has beeri
drinking heavily. He entered the store
of his father. J. M. Chiles, and demand
ed., money. It was refused, and â¢jyouits
Chiles seized a butcher knife from the
cheese box and ran his father out of
the store. Hi? mother and sister ap
peareÂ«J"and he likewise chased them
out cf the store and down" an alley. He
then returned, helped himself to the
mones* in the till and proceeded to
break all the chinaware and turn the
store upside down.
When he had satisfied himself in the
store he sought the street, the knife
hidden under his vest, and met O3cer
Patrick. The latter carried . an ax
handle, but was otherwise unarmed.
When he attempted to lay hands on
Chiles the latter whipped out his knife
and gave tbe officer a half-doaen
thrusts before he could be intercepted.
The affair has created quite a sensa
tion here en account of the good stand
ing of Patrick, who is a Grand Army
man and a highly respected citizen.

should the wounded officer die within
the next twenty-four hours quick Jus

THE SAN" FRAXCISCO CALL. TUESDAY. FEBRUARY 0. 1904.
MAKES CHARGES
OF CONSPIRACY
President Coleman of United
Carriage Company Says Men
Have Been Mulcting- Concern
Charges of a deep laid conspiracy,
which is said to have resulted In the
United Carriage Company being
mulcted of many hundreds of dollars
and the sudden wholesale dismissal of
employes of the concern, combined in
furnishing no end of excitement around
the office of the company in the Palace
Hote! yesterday.
According to reports that have gained
circulation, the management of the
carriage company, for several months
past, has been investigating stories
that have reached the ears of. the
stockholders to the effect that a num
ber of drivers and other employes of
the company were in league to defraud
the concern out of a certain percent
age of its earnings. "Detectives were
quietly employed on the case and their
reports are said to have led to the up
heaval yesterday.
It is claimed that . certain foremen
entered Into a conspiracy with a num
ber of drrvers whereby the latter were
to collect regular fares and turn them
over to the foremen, who, by means of
falsified accounts, were to divert a cer
tain amount of the company's revenue
into their own as well as the pockets of
the drivers.
Traps were laid and damaging evi
dence, it is claimed, was obtained
again?t a number of employes, in whom
the management of the carriage com
pany had for year3 reposed the greatest
confidence. Saturday several men
were discharged and yesterday a large
number were dismtssed and their places
promptly filled. Three foremen and
about fifteen drivers and other em
ployes of the company are said to have
been Inculpate. The method of de
frauding the company, it is said, was
a simple one in that the foremen prac
tically were intrusted with the business.
For instance, if a driver' was engaged
to carry a party of four to the Ocean
Beach and received the proper fare, he
would report back a single load to
some point within a close distance of
the Palace Hotel and turn In a fare
in keeping with the fixed rate for the
shorter distance. The balance of the
actual fare collected would then be
applied to the fund of the alleged con
spirators and at certain periods in the
months divided among the men In the
plot.
Just how long a ring among the em
ployes existed and the approximate
amount the company has lost through
ths dishonesty of its men is a matter
of speculation and probably will never
be known. Discussing the matter last
evening, Barry Coleman, president and
manager of the carriage company, said:
"Our investigation proceeded far
enough Into the affairs of the company
to thoroughly satisfy us that the com
pany has been badly mulcted, but to
what extent we may nevsr learn. Be
fore we took any definite action against
those toward whom suspicion was di
rected we had accumulated a pre
ponderance of evidence of their guilt
and then promptly removed them from
the company. Many of the men had
been with us for years, particularly the
foremen, who had enjoyed our confi
dence."
A number of the men dismissed yes
terday loudly protested their innocence
of any crooked work, but Manager
Coleman declined to hear them. Ex
perts have been at work on the b<y>ks
of the company for over a week and
they are still engaged on them, with a
view to determining within a possible
estimate the extent of the losses of the
concern and the date when -the con
spiracy was formed.

PLAN CLEVERLY EXECUTED
Bride r s Father Makes Hnrried
Trip to the City, but is Tee
Late to Prevent the Union
â Â£SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. S.â Cupid
has been busy and one of the most
charming of the society belles has
eloped and become a married woman.
Colton has not been stirred for many
moons as it is over this present elope
ment and the pretty romance promises
to furnish a topic for the swell set for
many a day to come. This afternoon,
iliss Stella Hebberd. the young lady in
the present affair, announced to her
parents her intention of attending a
function in this city. On the car she
was joined by a young lady friend, who
accompanied her to this city and saw
her safely on board the Santa Fe train
for Los Angeles. The friend then
posted a letter which the young lady
had written to her parents informing
them that she had gone to Los An
geles to become the wife of Peter Fil
anc, whom she had come to love with
increasing devotion. This evening her
father, W. C. Hebberd of the firm of
T. Hebberd Company and one of the
wealthiest men of this vicinity, was
fairly stunned when he opened the en
velope and read its contents.
He followed his daughter to Los
Angeles on the next train, but arrived
too late. Peter J. Filanc had not
planned such a romance for nothing,
and before he left . for Los Angeles
Sunday he had arranged with Miss
Hebberd that he would not send for
her 'unless all arrangements for the
marriage could be made satisfactorily,
for there are numerous questions which
priests must be satisfied upon before
they will consent to unite two fond
and loving harts. The lucky groom is
the sole heir to an estate valued at
5150,000. His mother is a descendant of
the famous Salazar familv. one of the
most aristocratic and influential fami
lies of the oU Spanish regime, while
tne late Mr. Filanc was a nobleman of
the old school, whose family had for
centuries been noted among the pastor

rich, even as far back as genealogy

â waded out in the water, trying to per
suade the older children to follow. Her
peculiar action attracted the attention
of "Crawfish George," an old fisher
man at the cove, -who can to town and
got several citizens to accompany him
to the scene. They arrived in time to
prevent the mother carrying out her
plan, although she had the baby.

of her hereditary purpose.
RUSSIA'S EXPLORATIONS
The Cossack Khabaroff in 1648, sail
ing from the mouth of the Kolyma
River around the northeastern end of
the continent ar.d through the straits,
rediscovered and named by Bering
eighty years later, entered and ex
plored the YaJu River for some dis
tance from its mcuth. St. Petersburg,
made cognizant of this, at once saw
the strategic importance of the move
and proceeded to make good the title.
Within the next two decades the Amur
was explored from Lake Baikal down
to the mouth, and the valley of the
river was occupied by Cossack posts.
Anxiety to keep peace with China and
not to endanger the tea trade via
Ki&tchn. caused Russia in 16S9, by the
treaty <-,f Xertchir.sk. to abandon, for
the time, the extension of her occupa
tion.
In is:,! the Russian ship Balkil en
tered the estuary of the Amur from the
ocean and established the port of Nik
alaievosky near the month of the riv
er. From that foothold Russia pushed
s-outh on the Pacific shores to Vladivos
tok, which in the last quarter of the
past century she made an important
port, commercially, as well as strate
gically. Closed, as it is during the best
half of the year, it did not suit her ul
timate purposes and she watched for
the opportunity of securing a better
situation farther south on water open
all the year round. This came in the
wake of the Chinese-Japanese War,
â¢ hen for certain services to China,
not yet fully discovered, but which op
erated to divest Japan of the fruits
bf ne^ victory in the shape of occu
pancy of Manchuria and domination
of Korea, sh? acquired, through the late
Li Hun? Chang and the Empress
Dov.Mger, under a 99-year lease,
possession of the strongly fortified sea
jÂ»orts of Port Arthur and Talienwan. at
the lower extremity of the Liaotung
Peninsula. This concession was coupled
with railway franchises in Man
churia and later the building of the
branch of the trans : Siberian Railroad
across that province to Vladivostok
and a branch from Harbin on that road
eouth via Mukden and Newchwang to
the newly acquired stronghold at the
mouth of the Gulf of Pechili.
EXTENDING IIEK DOMAIN.
In the few years that have inter
vened she has added greatly to the
strength of Port Arthur, made it her
naval and military base in the Far
*2ast and built up a grand city near by
â Dalnyâ as the commercial terminus
of hor great transcontinental railroad
system and by virtue of these port
leases and concessions she. has strung
her columns of troops through Man
churia and the adjoining province of
Mongolia and taken virtual possession
of every strategic point.
The other great European powers
were satisfied to get concessions of
equal commercial value Jn other parts
of China, but Japan was not. Sore
from being thrust out of Manchuria,
after her victory over China, to
give place to Russia, she has ever since
watched every move of the latter power
with an anxiously Jealous eye and at
tempted, by diplomatic deals with
ether European powers and â¢ at the
court of Korea to stop the "Bear" at
the Yalu River, separating Korea from
Manchuria. Lately she has seen that
Russia regards thÂ«* actual "possession
of Korea as indispensable to ultimate
consummation of her purposes in the
Far Eau and realizes at the, same time
the menace to her own safety and in
dependence in that possession.
Both countries have had for many
years Ftror.g diplomatic corps at Seoul,
the Korean capital, and have been
struggling 10 gain favor and material
concession? from the "Hermit King
dom." One intrigue followed close
upon the heels of another, Russ and
Jap in turn promoting, until the Gov
ernment Â«vas practically helpless and
the country in a state of anarchy.
In 189$. following a riotous collision
between the Independent Club, repre
senting the reform party, and their
opponents, -the King of Korea asked
Japan to send troops to Seoul to pre
serve order. On the protest of Russia
the contingent of Japanese soldiers or
dered to the scene was cut down anÂ«l
an equal force of Russians also called

A promise of reform on the part of
Um King in 1899 was followed by an ex
tension c-f Russian influence, and the

siacs on th? Yalu and the Japanese at
the lower end of the peninsula have
tended to "keep the whole kingdom in a
eort of turmoil.
FIGHTING FOR KOREA. "
The Japanese influence predominated
at the court of Seoul during the last
half of 1S9S, but in February. 1S99, when
the King, after failing to meet the
promises made to the reform party, fled
for fear of his life to the protection of
the Russian legation. Frequent rumors
of war followed during the next few
months, and again later, when Russia
asked for the cession of Masampho, on
the lower end of Korea, opposite Shirno
neseki, Japan, for a naval station. The
request was being favorably considered
when certain Japanese, acting, of
course, for their Government, bought
up all the land about the port In ques
tion available for strategic purposes.
Remonstrances on the part of Russia
prevented any use being made of the
territory purchased, however, and the
following year (1900) Russia acquired
such foothold at the place as to nullify
Japan's action In the matter.
The period covered by the Boxer
troubles in China (1899-1900) brought
outward calm to the situation in Ko
rea, but diplomatic scheming and
working went on just the same. At
the end of the Boxer trouble and on
the evacuation of Peking by the allies
the contest for the supremacy in Ko
rea was resumed with more acerbity
after a time than before. In Septem
ber, 1902, Yi-Heui, twenty-ninth of the
dynasty founded in 1392. who, after
having actually reigned for a number
c-f years, was declared titular Emperor
in 1897, was reported dead at the hands
of the reform party. Japan had in 1895
compelled him to proclaim the inde
pendence of Korea and to promise cer
tain reforms in the administration of
government^ affairs, as well as com
mercial regulations. This, as it were,
was assumed to give them an oversight
of his person and acts. This assump
tion end the attempted exercise of the
right, did not at all accord with thÂ«
views and purposes of Russia, so di
rectly opposed to every move of Japan.
Every day Trought sharper accent to
the strain cf relations between the two
until it became apparent some tl&M!
since that the. sword and rifle-gun
were to be the early arbiters of 'the
dispute. . . '
Though for some months past all
Europe and America have been in
tensely interested In the diplomatic
duel the sparring for time and veiling
the real purposes erf the two contestant
parties, they have been left In ignor
ance as to both proposals and counter
proposals as to the matter at issue,
bet are able to form some conjecture
&s to the real points at irsuo.
LAST STAGE OF THE TROUBLE.
The starting point is the convention
between Japan and Russia, signed at
Moscow June. 1896, by the late Prince
Lobanoff de Roslow for Russia and
Marshal Yamagata for Japan, which
was as follows:
Article 1â The Imperial Governments
of Japan and Russia definitely recog
nize the sovereignty and entire inde
pendence' of Korea and mutually en
gage to refrain from all direct interfer
ence in the Internal affairs of that
country..
Article 2â Desiring to avoid every

of Japan and Russia mutually engage

POLICE CATCH
A SLEEK CROOK
Mini "Who Jtas Been Occupying;
Rooms at Leading Hotels and
Cheating: Firms Now in Jail
It was with Infinite satisfaction that
a number of local tradespeople and
hotel proprietors learned from the Po
lice Department yesterday that a
"tank" at the Hall of Justice contained
the much wanted "Jack Corbett" of
New York, who had been devoting sev
eral days of his time to victimizing
firms out of their wares. Last Satur
day afternoon, as was related the fol
lowing morning in The Call, a dapper
young man, acting well the part of a
stranger, registered under the above
name at the Palace Hotel. Half an
hour later he had ordered a $50 suit of
clothes from Raphael's and Instructed
the salesman to have it delivered to
his rooms at the Palace, where he
would pay for It. When the delivery
man called Corbett donned the suit and
then requested the man to wait In his
room while he went to the office to
cash a check.
He never returned to the hotel. Yes
terday the same young man registered
at the California Hotel as "Harry Cor
bett and wife of New York." " He said
his wife was coming to the city on a
later train.
During the afternoon the fellow vis
ited the jewelry stores of A. Hlrsch
man, C. H. Kenn and William Flinde
mann and from each ordered jewelry
in sums of $150 to $175. He had the
goods'dellvered to him, C. O. D., at the
hotel, and when they arrived, under
the pretense of showing them to his
wife, he entered an . adjoining room

Knights of Columbus Enjoy
Their Annual Banquet in
Maple Room of the Palace
The annual banquet of the Knights
of Columbus took place in the Maple
room of the Palace last night, the
guests being seated at long tables dec
orated with sprays of evergreens, clus
ters of crimson carnations and silver
candelabra, with yellow shades. A
fine menu was served, 1 accompanied by
orchestral music.
Neal Power was toastmaster of the
evening. He introduced the different
speechmakers in an easy and felicitous
manner. Following were the subjects
and speakers: "The Church," Right
Rev. George Montgomery; "Our Coun
try," Joseph T. O'Connor; "Knights of
Columbus," Joseph Scott; "Our Coun
cil," George A. Connolly; "Fraternity,"
Andrew Corrigan; "The Ladies," Frank

The principal speech of the evening
was made by Archbishop Mo-ntgomery,
who took education for his main topic.
He said in part:
"We do not want to abolish the school
system.. We do not want to control
the schoc-l system. We do not want a
division of the school fund. We do
not want the State to pay for the teach
ing of*any man's religion. We simply
want to widen, broaden and deepen the
school system so as to make it in prac
tice what it claims to be in theory
fair and just to- all men. .
"We have amended the constitution
of the "United States fifteen times.
Might we not amend the school sys
tem once?
"Throw open education to free com
petition. Let the State pay for secular
education wherever and by whom im
parted, no matter whether religion is
taught there or no*." ' : Â«^

to build a railroad from Grants Pass.
Orego'n, to Crescent City, California,
returned yesterday from the north,
whtre he has been looking over the ter

He stated last evening that construc

already surveyed and secured rights of
way for two branches of its main line,
one westward to Chetko, on the coast

The latter branch Is expected to
eventually extend farther south in Cal

OF SITUATION
IS REALIZED
Soldiery on the Move in
â¢ Streets of St. Pe
tersburg.
Manifesto of Emperor
May Not Be Issued
Immediately.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. â¢ S.â The
Russian Foreign Office is preparing a
statement of the negotiations between
Russia and Japan. It may be in the
form of a circular note to the Russian
representatives abroad, but it is more
likely to be published in the Official
Messenger as an official communication.
The situation diplomatically is deli
g;ate and anomalous. Just what Japa
nese action Russia would consider
'aufc for war under the circumstances
is not clearly defined, but it is pointed
out that when Japan abruptly severed
diplomatic relations notification was
given concerning the Russo-Japanese
treaties of If 36 and 1SSS covering Ko
rea. These treaties provide for the inde
pendence of Korea, and in view of the
commercial interests of Japan in the
hermit kingdom Rufs ia .therein recog
nized Japan's right to send troops to
K^rea for the preservation of order.
There is, however, an important res
ervation. In case Japan considers it
recpssary to avail herself of this clause
Russia must receive an advance no
tification. The treaties are specific on
this point. Technically the landing of
a Japanese army in Southern Korea
without the notification â which Japan
could not give, now that diplomatic re
lations have ceased â would be a breach
of the spirit of the convention. The
Russian authorities declare their posi
tion diplomatically as very strong. It
::= possible, however, that Russia, in-
Ftead of insisting: on the inviolability
of these treaties at this juncture, will
tHfce her stand on the contentions set
up in the negotiations and await a
Japanese invasion of Northern Korea,
lor the neutrality of which Russia in-
Fisted, as an overt act equivalent to
war.
HOPE OF PEACE ENDS,
The situation is such that the author
ities are^prepared at any moment to
hear that Japan has made an aggres
sive move, wnich would make a sem
blance of peace any longer impossible,
and thÂ«* Czar !s making dispositions ae
t ordinpiy. Although in tiiplomatic cir
(>Â« ti; ;â â¢:<Â» still :Â« some vague talk to
the efirt r that hostilities may be avert -
M. thi? nope is regarded as so slender
as hard!y to be worth considering. Me
diation is believed to be impossible un
less the two adversaries, ask for it.
Neither France nor Great Britain are
in a position to offer their good offices
nn account of their alliances, and the
distrust here of the United States would
make it difficult for America to do so.
In short, v.ar is regarded here as prac
tically Inevitable.
The oecple of the Russian capital
have been thoroughly aroused by the
Japanese action and war is the only
subject discussed. The greatest activ
ity prevails in governmental circles.
Heavy snow is falling and the streets
are filled with marching soldiers in
campaign uniforms.
In the first hours of excitement, after
the receipt of the news of the Japanese
fiction, the imperial train was ordered
to be in readiness to start for Moscow,
but since then calm counsels prevailed
and the order was countermanded.
MANIFESTO IS DELAYED.
The Czar's departure is a matter of
uncertainty. Jt is a Question, indeed,
whether he will co to Moscow at all.
Certainly no manifesto will be issued
until v.ar is actually on.
Mr. Kurino, the retiring: Japanese
Minister here, says he wi'I leave St.
Petersburg Wednesday morning. He
adds that all of the affairs of the lega
tion will be closed and that r.o current
business will be left behind. The
United States embassy will probably
look after questions involving the pro
tection cf Japanese subjects. Embassa
rfor McCormick, under instructions to
day, asked Foreign Minister Lamsdorff
if Russia objected. A couple of police
men guard the entrance of the Jap
anese legation, but there has been no
attempt of eny public demonstration.
On the Bourse stocks were still fall

Bourse during the !ast hour. Lottery

Imperial Land Company of California
to take water from the Colorado River

to the fact that the Secretary of the
Treasury had especially recommended
it. and that with the rapid advance in,

gress would probably have to pay a
much larger sum for a site in the near
future if the purchase was not made
now.

In the District Court to-day Judge
Lewis overruled the motion of ex-
Congressman John M. Glover of Mis

assault with intent to murder Ser
geants Dittlemore and Smith of the
Colorado National Guard.
Glover conducted his own case, hav
ing declined the proffers of assistance
from fellow-members of the bar of

arraignment of Governor Peabody and
the militia for their connection with
the strike of miners in. this district.
Judge Lewis, in passing upon the mo
tion to dismiss, held that it was Viot
within the province of the court . to
judge the right or propriety of the

POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER WAR
Statement Is Published That United States and Great
Britain Later May Insist on a Man
churian Adjustment.
LONDON, Feb. 8.â The St James
Gazette asserts on diplomatic author
ity that, assuming Russia defeats
Japan, she will be confronted with a
demand for the acknowledgment of
Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria from
Great Britain and the United States
and that she must either grant it or
fight both countries. An understand
ing, the paper adds, has been reached
in this sense between the United
States and Great Britain.
Home Secretary Akers-Douglas, re
plying to a question In the House of
Commons to-day in behalf of the Gov
ernment, informed the Liberal leader,
Sir Henry Campbell-F.annerman, that
his Majesty's Government had been
officially Informed of the rupture of
diplomatic relaticns between Russia
and Japan, but it hadxno further in
formation regarding the details than
appeared in the newspapers.
Akers-Douglas added that the ques
tion of a belligerency law had been
fully considered, but he declined to an
swer a number of technical questions
regarding instructions relative to'coal
lng, repairs, etc., sent to the authorities
at British ports without due notice of
such questions.
OPINIONS IN LONDON.
The British Foreign Office does not
regard the Japanese note presented
February 5 to the Russian Foreign Of
fice by M. Kurino as establishing a
state of war, though It holds It would
justify a hostile act without any fur
ther notification on the part of Japan,
which the Foreign Office here also un
derstands will not be given. The course
taken by the United States embassy
at St. Petersburg in undertaking to
look after . the Interests of] Japanese
subjects in Russia was adopted be
cause the British Government regarded
itself as being too intimately concerned
In the dispute to accept such a re
sponsibility.. '
No such arrangement as suggested
by the St. James Gazette <that a de r
mand will be made that Russia must
either, giant Chinese sovereignty' in
Manchuria br.fight Great Britain ami
the United States) Is known of by the
Foreign Office here, nor had the For
eign Office late to-nijrht received r.ews
of the embarkation of Japanese troops.
Finally neither at the British office nor
in. any other diplomatic quarter is any
hope entertained that mediation could
now be arranged.
STATE DEPARTMENT DENIAL.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8.â State De
partment officials deny that any agree
ment has been made to the ?ffect that
the United States and Great Britain
after Russia has crushed Japan will in
sist that Manchuria remain part of
China. Ever since the Turko-Russian
War It has been customary for the
great neutral powers to hold some sort
of conference at the conclusion of the
war to assure the vanquished nation in
the struggle against undue exactions
and punishments. This was naturally
the course In the Turkish-Russian
War. and attention is called to. the
fact that although Japan was the vic
tor in her last war with China the neu
tral powers, especially Russia and
England, brought pressure ; to bear
upon Japan to prevent her from press-
ing her advantage beyond reasonable
limits. Incidentally'it was also pointed
out that the two nations named prof
ited themselves by the acquisition of
most Important strategical points
which had been the object of Japan's
operations.
Therefore it is saW to be within the
probabilities that some sort of a con
ference will follow a Russo-Japanese
war. The United States has alway3
hold aloof "from combinations in Such
cases, but as in the case of negotia
tions which terminated the Boxer
troubles.^the policy has been to work
on parallel lines when such a cause 13

JAPANESE CUT
CABLE TO KEEP
ACTION SECRET
Fifteen Thousand Cossacks
in Vicinity of the
Yalu.
PARIS, Feb. S.â The French Foreign
Office was advised this afternoon that
the Japanese have cut the cable con
necting Japan and Korea. The object
of this action is believed to be to pre
vent news of the operations of the
Japanese reaching the Russians, which
wes possible, r.o matter how closely
censored the dispatches sent might be.
Following the breaking off of relations
between Russia and Japan, the cutting
of the cable is regarded here as signifi
cant of the purpose of the Japanese to
begin hostilities.
It is learned that among the troops
sent by Russia to the vicinity of the
Yalu River are 15,000 Cossacks, whose
province it is to destroy the communi
cations of any Japanese army landing
along the coast or trying to strike the
Port Arthur railroad. The French mil
itary exDerts consider this a good tac
tical move, for the reason that the
Japanese have only a small cavalry
force, insufficient to cope with that of
the Russians.

Police' Capture Burglar.
A. C. Baker was arrested last night
by Patrolmen Hanley and Baxter and
registered on the detinue book. When
searched at the City Prison a bunch of
skeleton keys and a jimmy were found
in his possession. Baker attempted to
enter a barber shop oh Ellis street near
Leavenworth, but was unable ,to
manipulate the lock. He then entered
the basement of the premises at 40G
Leavenworth street, used r- a carpen
ter shop by J. A. Basko, and attempted
to open a tool chest with the Jimmy.
He was unsuccessful and left without
securing any plunder. The officers
found him loitering in the neighbor
hood and took -him Into custody. The
jimmy fits the marks on the tool chest
perfectly and the police believe they
have a strong case against Baker. He
is a middle-aged man and supposed to
be an ex-convict.

That Was Presented
, by Kurino.
Complaint Over Russia's
Occupation of Man
churia.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 8.â The
following is the text of M. Kurlno's
statement of February 6 to the For
eign Office here:
"The independence and territorial in
tegrity of the Korean empire being re
garded by the Japanese Government
as absolutely essential to their own
country's security and repose, they
cannot view with indifference any ac
tion tending to render the â 'position of
Korea Insecure. The Russian Gov
ernment his by means of Inaflmissibl*
amendment successively rejected
Japan's proposals respecting Korea, tha
adoption of which the Japanese Gov
ernment regarded as indispensable to
assuring the independence and terri
torial integrity of the Korean empire
and to safeguarding Japan's prepon
derin? interests in the peninsula.
RUSSIA IX MANCHURIA.
"This attitude on the part of Russia,
coupled with their successive refusals
to enter into an agreement with re
spect to China's territorial integrity in
Manchuria, which is seriously menaced
by Russia's continued occupation of
that province, notwithstanding her
treaty engagements with China and
her repeated assurances to the other
powers having interests in the same
region, has rendered It necessary for
the Japanese Government to seriously
consider what measures of self-defense
they are called upon to take in the
presence of the delay on the part of tha
Russian Government in connection
with the pending negotiations which
has remained largely unexplained, and
of thsir naval and military activity,
which it is difficult to reconcile with
an entirely pacific aim.
"In the pending negotiations the Jap
anese. Government has exercised a de
gree of forbearance which it believes
affords absolute proof -of Its loyal
desire to remove from the relations
between Japan ar.d Russia every cause
for future misunderstandings, but find
ing in its efforts no prospect of se
curing from the Russian Government
any adhesion either to Japan's moder
ate and unselfish proposals or to any
other proposals likely to establish a
firm and lasting policy in the Far
East, the Japanese Government now
has no other alternative than to ter
minate the present futile negotiations.
In adopting that course the Japanese
Government reserved to itself the
right to take such independent action
as it may deem 'best to consolidate
and defend Japan's menaced position.
as well as to protect her rights and
legitimate Interests.
DIPLOMACY AT AX END.
"The Japanese Government, having
exhausted in vain every means of con
ciliation, with the view of removing
from the relations of the two coun
tries every cause for future complica
tion, and findings that its just repre
sentations and moderate and unselfish
proposals, made in the Interest erf per
manent peace in the Far East, were
not receiving from the Russian Gov
ernment the consideration which is
their due, have resolved . to sever its
diplomatic relations with the Russian
Government, which for the reason
named has ceased to possess value."
At the Japanese legaticm here this
was regarded as tantamount to a dec
laration of war. and it is believed that
no other announcement will be made uÂ»
the world.
FIGHTING EXPECTED SOON.
Austrian Naval Officer Says Russian
and Japanese Troops Have Sailed.
BERLIN, Feb. S.â A dispatch to the
Cologne Gazette from Vienna says Ad
miral Baron von Spaun. commander in
chief of the Austrian navy, has received
a dispatch from the commander of the
Austrian legation guard at Peking to
the effect that Japan has embarked
her regiments of guards and two army
divisions on forty steamers. The dis
patch added that a Russian cruiser di
vision had sailed from Port Arthur and
that fighting: was expected hourly.
The German Government is prepared
to issue a proclamation of severe neu
trality should hostilities hegin. The
popular German feeling is divided be
tween a certain admiration for the lit
tle people of Japan and the necessarily
greater community of interests, in in
ternatinal, political and trade, with
Russia. Germany's neutral atti
tude is a complex of vague territorial
hopes in China. long-standing intoler
ance of Japan's ambitions, dislikes of
Russia and a desire to separate Russia
from France by winning Russia's good
will.
The Russian embassy In a statement
given to the National Zeltung says war
probably cannot be averted and that
mediation by other powers . is wholly
out of the question.

WASHINGTON, F*b. S.â Tentative
orders have been prepared sending the
cruiser squadron of the Asiatic fleet
northward from Sub'.g Bay to the vi
cinity of Port Arthur to observe- the
Japanese and Hus.'ian naval operations
and there to be at hand to protect
American interests wherever they may
be menaced in the war-stricken dis
trict- The orders were submitted to
ihe President for final revision, but will
not be sent un!rss they are agreeable
to Itu5F?a a^d Jeps:n, which will be
sounded in advance on this side.
When the <rrders were prepared to
day jt wap expected they would be sent
forthwith, in view or the restraining
instructions the.- contained for Rear
Admiral Evans, .commanding the Asi
atic Beet, to observe strict neutrality
in all his movements. Secretary Moody,
howrvc-r, is not willing that this coun
try shall give ground even for suspi
cion either by IiusÂ«=5a or Japan, and it
has therefore been decided that these
povernmentp shall be asked if the dis
patch of the cruiser squadron to north
ern waters will embarrass either com
batant.
EVAN'S IX COMMAND.
The cruiser squadron consists of the
flagship Albany, the New Orleans, Ra
leiph and Cincinnati. In case the squad-<
ron groes northward it is fully expected
here that Rear Admiral Evans will
transfer his Hag to the Albany and as
sume command of the squadrÂ«n, re
maining in the Far East after his regu
lar tour of duty has expired to observe
the war.
Orders w^re Issued to-day for Lieu
tenant N". A. McCauHy, now on the Dol
phin, to relieve Lieutenant Commander
Charles S. Marsh as naval attache at
Toltio. Lieutenant Commander Marsh
and Lieutenant I. V. Gillis, who has
been detached from the Kentucky and
is now on b'S way to Tokio. are under
orders to follow th* Japanese naval
operations as best they can. It is not
expected that they will be takrn aboard
th^ Japanese shins permanently.
That Jatian has fully determined on
â war is evident from a cablegram re
ceived at the Xavy Department to-day
from Lieutenant Marsh saying that a
Japanese naval division had left for
Chemulpo, the port of the Korean capi
tal. The seizure of Seoul, the general
naval board believes, will be Japan's
first act of war.
CASSIXI CALIFS OX HAY.
Count Cassini. tha Russian EmbasFa
<lor, called by appointment on Secre
tary Hay at S o'clock and the two were
in conference for nearly an hour. The
Embassadcr was again as?urod that
this Government could be depended on
to maintain the strictest and most
complete neutrality in the coming war.
Count Cassini gave Mr. Hay a brief
summary of the negotiations. He in
formed the Secretary that" Russia was
convinced that Japan had all along
been anxious for war and that her
breaking off of diplomatic relations at
the moment when Husfla was putting
forth her utmost effort to make con
cessions that would preserve peace,
was an evidence of bad faith.
In Russian circles it is not expected
that Japan will formally declare war,
but that she wi!l attempt to catch
Russia unaware?. It is declared that
the Russian army and fleet will be
found ready and waHins; that Russia
â¢mill not assume ihf offensive until she
has b^en attacked, but after that there
will be no delay.
At the Japanese legation it was said
to-nisht that th^re was no further
news on the situation to be given out.
At the Russian embassy no cables
came from any source.
The Chinese and Japanese Ministers
called at the State Department in
gcarch of information from the seat of
trouble in the Far East and saying
thpy had no news.
It has b< N cn practically settled that
the United States army shall be repre
sented as a military observer with the
Russian army by Brigadier General H.
A. Allen, chief of the Philippine Con
etabulary. Major Oliver K. "Wood will
be United States military observer with
the Japanese army. He ha? been for
some time I'niU-d States military at
tacho at Tokio and at Seoul and is said
to be exceedingly popular with the Jap
anese army officers.
The outbreak of war between Russia
ar.d Japan will, it is believed here, be
followed by the- precipitate flight of the
Empress Dowager and the entire Chi
nese court from Peking to Southefn
China, where they took refuge in 1900.
Information received by the State De
partment several days aso indicated
that this would be the case.
Cablegrams received at a European
eistessy say that the flight of the court
may precipitate a dangerous condition
of unrest throughout China. It will
leave the Government without a head
in Poking and will practically close
every door of communication to the
Peking Government. Several European
powers are extremely anxious that this
menace to foreigners in China may be
averted and are inclined to bring pres
sure to bear through theirârepresenta
tives at Peking to prevent it.
At the State Department to-day of
ficials declined to say how far the
United States had gone or would go in
this direction, but it is known to^be
the desire of this Government that the
Empress Dowager remain in Peking.
It is believed that Mr. Conger will use
his efforts In that direction- The State
Department has been informed by the
American embassy in St. Petersburg
wd the American legation at Tokli
{hat M. Kurino, the Japanese Minister
Troops Are to Attack the
City of Seoul in

of direct negotiations with Rus
sia, with the view of arriving at
a friendly adjustment of their mu
tual interests in both Manchuria
and Korea, where their interests
meet, communicated toward flie
end of July last such desire to the
Russian Government and invited
its adherence. To this the Rus
sian Government expressed a
willing assent. Accordingly on
the 1 2th of August the Japanese
Government proposed to Russia,
through its representative at St.
Petersburg, the basis of an agree
ment which was substantially as
follows:
JAPAN MAKES PROPOSAL.
First â A mutual engagement to
respect the independence and ter
ritorial integrity of the Chinese
and Korean empires.
Second â A mutual engagement
to maintain the principle of an
equal opportunity for the com
mercial industry of all nations
with the nations of those coun-
tries.
Third â A reciprocal recogni
tion of Japan's preponderating in
terests in Korea, and that Russia
has special interests in railway
enterprises in Manchuria, and a
mutual recognition of the respec
tive rights of Japan and Russia
therein;
Fourth â The recognition by
Russia of the exclusive right of
Japan to give advice and assist
ance to Korea in the interest of
reform and good government.
Fifth â The engagement on the
part of Russia to unimpede the
eventual extension of the Korean
Railway into Southern Man
churia so as to connect with East
ern China and the Shanghai-
Kwan Xewchwang lands.
It was the intention of the Jap
cnese Government originally that
a conference take place between
their representatives at St. Peters
burg and the Russian authorities,
so as to facilitate progress as
much as possible in reaching a so
lution of the situation, but the
Russian Government absolutely
refused to do so on the plea that
the Czar planned a trip abroad,
and for other reasons it was un
avoidably decided to conduct the
negotiations at Tokio. It was not
to Russia, and Baron de Rosen, the
Russian Minister at Tokio, have taken
leare of the governments to which they
are accredited, thus marking the for
mal severance of diplomatic relations
between the two countries.
Regarding the attitude of the United
States, Assistant Secretary of State
Lcomia reiterated to the Russian Em
bassador that the United States would
observe complete- neutrality. No dec
laration of neutrality will be made un
til actual hostilities, commence or war

ROME. Feb. 8. â King Victor Em
manuel had a long interview with
Premier Giolitti and Marine Minister
Mirabelli to-day as a result of the
severance of diplomatic relations be
tween Russia and Japan, and ended
in expressing the hope that war still
may be averted. The King asked the
Premier to keep Foreign Minister Tlt
toni, who is new In Naples, informed
on all that transpired in the Far East.
Minister Mirabelli has cabled in
structions to the commander of the
Italian squadron in the Far East to
send the Italian third-class cruiser
Piemonte from Shanghai to Japan, to
keep the third-class cruiser Elba
In Korean waters to protect Italian in
terests, and to have the armored
cruiser Vittore Pisani communicate be
tween them. The third-class cruiser
Puglia, now at San Francisco, has
been ordered to Japan. Two other
warships are ready to start for the
Far East. â¢
An exchange \of views on the sub
ject is taking place between the coun
tries whose rulers, like the King ot
Italy, have received letters from the
Emperor of Korea announcing his in
tention to abstain from any act which
might be interpreted an a breach of
neutrality. â¦
Although not unexpected, the latest
news from the Far East deeply af
fected the Pope, whose mind Immedi
ately turned to the faithful and mis
sionaries exposed to the horrors of
war. The Pontiff said:
"I shall have hope in the peaceful
disposition of the Czar. Let us pray
that God may guide him."

action in Korea. For instance,
while recognizing Japan's right to
dispatch troops when necessary
for the* protection of her interests
in Korea, Russia refused to al
low her to use any portion of Ko
rean territory for strategical pur
poses. In fact, Russia went so
far as to propose to establish a mu
tual zone in Korean territory
north of the thirty-ninth parallel.
The Japanese Government ut
terly failed to see why Russia,
who protests no intention of ab
sorbing Manchuria, should be
disinclined to insert in the con
vention a clause in complete har
mony with her own repeatedly
declared principle respecting the
sovereignty and territorial integ
rity of China. Furthermore, this
refusal of the Russian Govern
ment impressed the Japanese
Government all the more with
the necessity of the insertion of a
clause to the effect that Japan
has important commercial inter
ests in Manchuria and entertains
no small hopes of their further
development, and that politically
Japan has even greater interests
th,ere by reason of its relations to
Korea, so that she could not pos
sibly recognize Manchuria as be
ing entirely outside her sphere of
interests.
These reasons- decided Japan
to reject absolutely the Russian
proposal in this report and ac
cordingly the Japanese Govern
ment explained the above views
to the Russian Government and
at the same time introduced other

FOR JAPANESE
French Officials Think
Russia Will Crush
Her Enemy.
Powers May Combine to
Make Early End of
the Conflict
PARIS. Feb. S.â The Echo de Paris
publishes the following, attributed to
a person of high official standing:
"Opinion at the Foreign Office 13 very
pessimistic, but I can assure you that
French diplomacy will be equal to the
task of striving to effect a conclusion
and sparing Japan the crushing defeat
which threatens her. The final crush
ing of Japan Is certain^ and under the
conditions France considers it to be to
the Interest of Great Britain. Japan's
ally, to exercise decisive pressure iu
order to avert war. There is no doubt
that France is ready, it the Japanese
Government is willing, to offer her me
diation to Japan and Russia, if It 13
not too late. Lord Lansdowne has of
fered Japan Great Britain's good offices
and King Edward has sent a long tele
gram to the Mikado, begging him to
reflect.
"At the present time China Is remain-
Ing neutral. The intervention of a third
power being unlikely a general confla
gration in the Far East is not to be
feared.
NATIONS APPREHENSIVE.
"At the first decisive defeat sustained
by Japan France and Great Britain will
renew the offer of their good offices,
should these have been declined the
first time. The Foreign Office expects
to receive long telegrams from the
French diplomatic representatives at
Tokio and St. Petersburg."
The Gaulois, maintaining that war
has been forced on Russia by the "vain
glorious folly of Japan, that parvenue
of civilization," declares that Russia Js
about to shed her blood for Europe,
whom she will save from the yellow
peril. The paper declares alao that tht?
war is almost certain to be localized,
adding that the British Government
has given M. Delcasse formal assur
ances on this subject.
Continuing, the Gaulois says that
French diplomatic circles" consider that
Great Britain, in spite or her antipathy
for Russia, will find It to her interest
to conciliate that power, especially on
account of her projects in Thibet, and
that she will immediately inform Japan
that not having heeded her pacific
counsels Japan cannot count on the
support of the British Cabinet.
ATTITUDE OF* THE FRENCH.
It is probable that a collective note
signed by the British, French and Ger
man and. it is hoped, the American
chancellories, will shortly be addressed
to Japan notifying her of the neutrality
of these four powers 1Â». whatever may
happen. Eventual French intervention,
the Gaulois concludes, will thus De
avoided and this is something the Quai
d'Orsay considers a vital point.
Of the papers published here the Gil
Bias alone does not express sympathy
for Russia, but declares that the power
which did not help France at the time
of the Fashoda Incident cannot expect
Frenchmen to risk their skins for Rus
sian interests in Manchuria. The Ma
tin is strongly pro- Russian and accuses
Japan of aggressive brutality.
The correspondent of the Matin in
London telegraphs -another interview
with Baron Hayashi. the Japanese Min
ister there/ who told him that Japan
has already notified China that In the
event of her victory the integrity of
China will be respected. The Minister
hinted that one of the principal objects
of the Japanese in the beginning of
the campaign would be the destruction
of the railroad from Harbin to Port
Arthur and that Japan hoped for much
from the Manchurian brigands, who
detest the Russians.
necessary amendments in the
Russian counter proposals.
They further proposed with re
gard to a neutral zone that if one
was to be created it should be es
tablished on both sides of the
boundary lines between Man
churia and Korea, with equal
width, say 50 kilometers. After
repeated discussions at Tokio the
Japanese Government presented
the Russian Government with
their final ' amendment on the
30th of October.
LAST EFFORT FAILS.
The Japanese Government then
frequently urged the Russian Gov
ernment for a reply, which was
again delayed, and only delivered
on the nth of December. In
that v reply Russia suppressed
clauses relating to Manchuria so
as to make the proposed conven
tion apply entirely to Korea, and
maintained its original demands
in regard to the non-employment
of Korean territory for strategi
cal purposes, as well as a neutral
zone, but the exclusion of Man

vention being contrary to the
original object of the negotia
tions, which -were to remove

causes of conflict between the two
countries by a friendly arrange
ment of their interests both
in Manchuria and Korea.
The Japanese Government
asked the Russian Government
to reconsider the question and
again proposed the removal of
the restriction regarding the use
of Korean territory and the en
tire suppression of a neutral zone
on the ground that if Russia was
opposed to the establishment of
one in Manchuria it should not
establish one in Korea. The last
reply of Russia was received at
Tokio on the 6th of January. In
this reply, it is true, Russia pro
posed to agree to insert the fol
lowing clause in the proposed
agreement: '"The recognition by
Japan of Manchuria and its lit
toral as outside of her sphere of
interests, while Russia, within the
limits of that province, would not
impede Japan nor any other pow
ers in the enjoyment of rights and
privileges acquired by them un
der existing treaties with China,
exclusive of the establishment of
settlements."
But this was proposed to be
agreed upon only upon conditions
maintaining the clauses regard
ing a neutral zone in Korean ter
ritory and the non-employment
of Korean territory for strategi
cal purposes, the . conditions
whereof were impossible of
Japan's acceptance, as had already
been fully explained to them.
It should further be observed
that no mention was made at all
of the territorial integrity of
China in Manchuria, and it must
be self-evident to everybody that
the engagement now proposed by
Russia would be unpractical in
value as long as it was unaccom
panied by a definite stipulation re
garding the territorial integrity of
China in Manchuria, since treaty
rights are only coexistent with
sovereignty.
Eventually absorption of Man
churia by Russia would annul at
once those rights and privileges
acquired by the powers in Man
churia by virtue of treaties with
China.
Therefore the Japanese move
ment was deemed indispensable
to obtain Russia's agreement to
the territorial integrity of Man
churia. It was further decided in
regard to Korea to adhere to
their amendment as there was ab
solutely no room for concessions
on these lines.
They on the 13th of January

this effect, which was communi
cated'to the rjiress; and M. Pres

Premier Combes the assurance

The Action, a Governmental

Japan Keeps Lookout for
the Russian Coal
Ships.
LONDON, Feb. 9 (Tuesday, 5 a. m.).â
Information available in London shews
that Russia has accumulated over
200,000 tons of Welsh steam coal, a part
of which is already at Port Arthur and
part is on the way from Cardiff. Al
though there are some forty cargo
boats laden with coal for the Far East,
the greater part of it is destined for
Port Arthur.
These boats are known and marked
by the Japanese, and day by day their
course is pricked off on a chart, so
that when they reach Eastern waters
they may be found within forty-eight
hours by Japanese warships.
The Japanese's own store of steam
coal is only some 130,000 tons, but it
is not impossible that the Port Arthur
consignments will have to run ,_ a
gauntlet of Japanese cruisers before
arriving at Port Arthur and that a
good proportion may fall into Japan
ese hands.
Little doubt exists that Japan will
declare coal a contraband of war. In
deed, it has been reported that she al
ready has done so by notifying China
that no more coal is to be shipped by
that country to Port Arthur.
A Tientsin dispatch reports a Rus
sian force at Kalpan, 110 miles north
west of Peking, and preparations are
being made for the flight of the Chi
nese court and removal of the imperial
treasure, as it is feared Russia will de
scend upon Peking.
QUESTION TIIE PREMIER.
Deputies Assured by Combes That
Country Will Remain Xeutral.
PARTS. Feb. 9. â All the newspa
pers this morning, without distinction
of party, are striving to reassure the
public on the possibility of France
being drawn into the conflict.
According to the Matin M. Del
casse's reply to a Deputy who asked
whether the Russian alliance would
not oblige France to intervene in case
Great Britain or some other power
aided Japan was that In that case
there might be a moral engagement,
but there was certainly no written en
gagement to compel France's Inter
vention.
Premier Combes was questioned by
several Deputies and gave assurance
that the Government was determined
whatever might arise not to do any
thing which' could alienate France's
liberty without the Chamber of Depu
ties and the whole Parliament being
called upon not merely to pronounce
on the attitude to be taken, but with
out being informed of every detail of
the events which had occurred or
might occur.
The Matin says that Premier Combes
was so precise in his statements that
the intention of demanding the publi
cation in a yellow book of all the docu
ments relating to the engagements con
tracted by France toward Russia has
been abandoned.
The Gaulols this morning publishes
an interview with a retired French
army officer who accompanied General
Boisdeffre on the mission to Russia
which resulted in the signing of the
military convention, between France
and that power. This officer says that
the document which was signed In Sep
tember, 1S9'2, did not consider the pos
sibility of war with Great Britain, but
was intended solely to hold the triple
alliance in check.
He declares, however, that an ad
dition Was subsequently inserted by
M. Delcasse providing that France
should furnish ships and men in the
event of Russia's declaring war, even
in the Far East, should a third power
intervene. It was not stipulated that
this power should be of Europe, there
fore the intervention of China and
even Korea would oblige France to
aid Russia materially.

SEA FIGHTS
WILL PROVE
NAVIES' POWER
Japan Has the Benefit
of Ports Close to
Scene of War.
South American Ships
May Increase Mika
do's Fleet .
It is generally conceded that the na
vies of Russia and Japan will .be tha
most prominent factors In the conflict.
and it is possible that the world may
at last learn the actual fighting values
of modern ships of war. There is but
a slight difference in the strength of
the two contending navies, for the larg
er number of Russian armored ships ia
offset by better types and superior per
sonnel of the Japanese battleships and
aunored cruisers, and the fact that
Japan's facilities for supplying and
maintaining her fleet are vastly supe
rior to those of Russia gives the smaller
navy a distinct advantage.
Russia's fight is practically away
from home. Port Arthur and Vladi
vostok, nearly 1200 miles apart, are its
only two naval ports in the Orient,
and, Vladivostok being inaccessible
during the winter months, only Port
Arthur remains as a harbor of refuge
and defense for upward of eighty ves
sels, including destroyers, torpedo-boats
and transports.
DOCKS FOR WARSHIPS.
Japan, on the other hand, has four
dockyards and five naval harbors, five
of which are distant only 240 to 583
miles from Port Arthur. The latter
port is far from being an ideal harbor.
It can accommodate only a small num
ber of vessels and the dockyard could
be shelled by an enemy in the open
sea without great risk to it from the
Russian fprts. Thus Russia has "all
har esgs in" one basket," while Japan's
dockyards, naval harbors and sources
of supply are distributed on three isl
ands difficult to approach, well forti
fied and impossible to blockade.
A protracted war, therefore, would
be disastrous to Russia, and efforts to
strike a decisive blow to annihilate Ja
pan's navy may be looked for. Should
Russia 'ail in this, or even only par
tially succeed. Japan's chances for final
victory might still be considered good.
Russia has dispatched every avail
able vessel of the Baltic fleet to the
Orient, a voyage of 12.000 miles, and
there remain at home ports only seven
coast defense ."hips, too small for for
eign service, besides eight battleships
and four armored cruisers. Four of
the. battleshipsâ the Alexander II, the
Na'varin, the Peter Veliki and the
Sissoiâ are of old construction and un
dergoing repairs, and four ships
launched in 1901-02 are being pushed
toward) completion.
VESSELS OP RUSSIA.
Only two of the armored cruisers, the
Admiral Nakhlmoff and the Pamyat
Azova, will be serviceable with pres
ent repairs completed. Of the unarm
cred fleet practically all of any pos
sible use have been sent to Asiatic
waters, as well as about twenty de
stroyers and a like number of torpedo
boats, of which records are confusing
owing to recent change of names that
were already difficult enough to grasp
by any one not a Russian. In destroy
ers and torpedo-boats the two navies
possess about an equal number.
It is quite possible that Japan may
effect further purchases from the South
American republics, which have still
a number of excellent ships to dispose
of; but as It stands at present Japan's
fighting fleet la the stronger, unless
Russia Is permitted to bring reinforce
ments from the Black Sea, where she
has nine battleships, two armored
cruisers and seven cruisers, the greater
number of which are of doubtful effi
ciency. V.

Plants of Ice Age.
BT PTtEEERICK \CHIGHT. A. M.. U* D.
Author of "The Act of Ice la North America,"
â¢â Man and tba Glacial Period." etc.
(Copyright. 100Â«, by Joseph B. Bow!Â«Â».)
Before the g'.aelal period the plants
which now flourish !n the latitude of
Virginia and North Carolina were
growing In a happy family In Spitzber
gen. Northern Greenland and on the
Arctic shores of North America. Arctic
expeditions have repeatedly brought
back from the midle tertiary deposits
north of Disco Island the embedded
leaves and fruit of magnolias, sasafras,
hickories, maples, poplars, birches, lin
dens, southern cypress and several spe
cies of sequoias, including the gigantic
forms now found only in California,
and three kinds of ginko trees now
peculiar to Japan. The evidence of
these fossil plants is conclusive that
just before the glacial period there was
a warm climate all around the north
pole.
Until the theory of the origin of
precies by natural selection was ac
cepted and the facts about the glacial
jteriod brought to light this distribution
of trees and plants was a profound
mystery. For the solution of the prob
lem we are largely indebted to the late
Professor Asa Gray, who in 1S59 read a
I<aper before the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences on the flora of Japan
ivhich attracted the attention of the
scientific world and opened the way to
the full exposition of his theory, which
v.as set forth in an address before the
American Association for the Advance
ment of Science at Dubuque. Iowa, in
JST2. The way had been prepared for
this work by the fact that the larse
<ol'ection of Japanese plants gathered
by Commodore Perry's expedition in
3 s o7. which opened Japan to the world,
â "â¢as placed in his hands for examina
tion. The result was that it appeared
that there was a striking similarity be
tween the plants of Japan and those
of the Altai Mountains, of the Hima
layas atrd the eastern portion of North
America, and a striking dissimilarity
between the plants of these regions and
those of the Pacific slope of North
America, while the most remarkable re
semblance was between the plants of
Japan and those of Eastern United
States.
The Pacific coast of the United
States is rich in coniferous trees like
cedars, sequoias and redwoods, but is
conspicuously lacking in most of the
trees familiar on the Atlantic slope.
For example, there are not half as
many maples, or ashes, or poplars, or
walnuts, or birches, or oaks on the
Pacific slope as on the Atlantic slope,
r.nd those are of such inferior quality
that it is said "a passable wagon wheel
cannot be made of California wood,
nor a really good one in Oregon." The
Atlantic slope has four times as many
?pccics of non-coniferous trees as the
Pacific slope, but only a little more
than half as many coniferous species.
The first step in the solution of this
problem is found in the relation of the
land continents in the northern hemis
phere to each other. Whereas, the
southern ends of the continents project
far out into deep seas so that they
are widely separated from each other,
at the north they all approach each
other and are separated by shallow
peas. The water !n Bering Strait is
only l^o feet deep, and that in the sea
only a few hundred feet, so that a
slight elevation of the bottom of the
ocean there would join Asia to Amer
ica, and permit the migration of plants
and animals from one continent to an
other. That these continents have been
recently joined by Euch a change in
land level is proved by the fact that
bones of the mammoth have been found
en both sides of Bering Strait, and even
on the Pribyloff Islands, far out in
Bering Sea. A similar belt of shoal
water extends from Greenland by. way
of Iceland to Norway. It is therefore
*asy to suppose a continuous land con
nection clear around the north pole
enabling plants and animals to migrate
freely. On the other hand, the gen
eral resemblance of species both of
plants and animals in the lands sur
rounding the ..^th pole is proof that
there has been such opportunity for
migration. Whereas thero is this great
similarity in species in the northern
hemisphere, there Is a total dissimilar
ity ben.oen the species occupying the
southern extremities of the continents
in the southern hemisphere.
But with the coming on of the
Rl.icial period this happy family of
ppecics around the north .pole was
rudely disturbed by the new condi
tions. " The lowering of temperature
and the slow accumulation of glacial
ice made it impossible for trees of a
temperate climate to maintain their
existence on those inhospitable shores.
Jf they wore to exist any longer they
must emigrate to milder climes. But
how shall a tree which is fixed in the
soil remove to better its fortune? Of
course, a single tree is helpless in such
q situation. But, as Professor Gray
wittily Bays, when a tree Is driven to
en cxtreruity it can "take to the
woods," und the forest can begin a
majestic movement: toward better
climes. â â â *":â¢<â¢,'".â¢>-*' ; - * â 
As thr- conditions favoring the for
est became severe along Its northern
belt they would become favorable over
a corresponding belt stretching to the
itouthJ Over this belt the Beads would
be gradually scattered by various
.agencies: Some seed* would be blown
by the wind, come carried by streams
cf water, some by birds-Â£nd squirrels
and other animals. Whereas formerly
such stray seeds had failed to find fa
vorable conditions in these new fields,
now they would bo the favored ones,
and thus $he species which they rep
resented would slowly spread south
ward until the glacial period had ex
hausted itself and the extreme limit of
favorable conditions had been reached.
Thus it would result that the same
species would be driven down to cor
responding latitudes on both sides of
the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and we
should have what now appears â
namely, the same species of plants in
Japan, the middle United States and
Europe and Northern Asia.
But it still would seem to be a puz
zle why the plants were not the same
in corresponding latitudes on both
sides of the American continent. Why
should the species of plants in Cali
fornia be so different from those in
Pennsylvania and Virginia? This is
answered by considering the different
conditions which prevail on the east
and west sides of a continent. Be
cause the world turns from west to
east the prevailing winds in the north-
I ern hemisphere are from the south
west. The breezes of the Pacific coast
are therefore sea breezes, laden with
moisture, while those in the Eastern
Atlantic States are land breezes,
which have been largely bereft of their
moisture and are subject to greater
alternations of temperature. The con
stant action of these diverse conditions
would have a direct effect to favor
some species on the Atlantic coast that
would not be favored on the Pacific,
and vice versa. Thus we have every
thing accounted for in a most natural
way. ,
The reason why these plants have
not returned to Greenland and Spitz
bergen is that the glacial period is.
not yet over. It still prevails in those
northern regions. But they have start
ed on their northward journey and have
partially recovered the ground lost.
Some have already attained their orig
inal homes, leaving 1 , however, many
stragglers en the way. The main body
of Arctic- vegetation is the same with
that which covered the country on the
Middle Atlantic States during the cli
max of the glacial period. Of the strag
gling remnants still left in favoring
situations one of the most interesting
is Scotch heather, which is found not
only in Labrador, but in a few places
in Massachusetts, like Andover and
Cape Cod. In ail the rocks gorges open
ing into Lake Krie remnants of the
glacial vegetation are preserved in the
sequestered and cool shady nooks.
Some such are also preserved in simi
lar narrow, cool gorges opening into
the Ohio River below Cincinnati.
But the mountains formed the best
retreats for the Arctic plants, which
were following up the ' receding ice
sheet. Alpine plants are found on the
high elevations of the White Moun
tains and on the high peaks of the
Rock and Sierra Nevada Mountains as
far south as New Mexico, but are ab
sent over all the intervening: areas.
These colonies of Arctic species on the
tops of the mountains of the northern
hemisphere are related to the atmos
phere, as the plants on islands are to
the water of the ocean, and are most
important witnesses to the reality and
extent of the continental ice fields
which characterized the glacial period.
A mountain to-p is an island in the air.
One can reach Arctic conditions by go
ing up as weH as by going north.
In some respects the effect of the
glacial period upon animal life and dis
tribution was even more peculiar than
that on plants. During that period a
large number of Arctic species were
crowded down into Central Europe and
into the Middle and Northern States of
the Atlantic coast and Mississippi Val
ley, la company with man's remains
there are found those of the grizzly
bear, the Irish elk, the reindeer, the
musk ox and the Arctic fox, while the
ibex and the chamois, which now oc
cupy the high mountain crags, descend
ed to the valleys. Several of these
northern species now extinct were also
present in those temperate regions.
The indirect effect of this incursion
of Arctic animals into the temperate
zone was to cause the destruction of
many animal forms which already oc
cupied the region. Just before the gla
cial period there were living in America
two extinct species of the cat family
as large as lions, four species of the dog
family as larse as wolves, while the
walrus was found in Virginia, the sea
cow in South Carolina. There were also
living six species of horses, the South
American tapir and llama, a camel, two
species of buffalo, three specie3 of
sheep, two species of elephant and two
of mastodons, a species of megathe
rium, three of megalonyx and one of
mylodon â huge terrestrial sloths a3
large as the rhinoceros or even as the
elephant. All these and several more
species were either destroyed by the
competiton of the northern animals or
were driven back into South America.
The destruction of so many widely
spread species . of animals occupying
North America just before the glacial
period is one of the most startling rev
elations of geology.
Insects also, as well as plants and the
larger animals, were compelled to
reckon with the glacial period. -Among
the most Interesting illustrations of
this occurs in the White Mountains,
where various Alpine species of butter
flies are found near the ..summit. In
ascending Mount Washington one sud
denly encounters near the top whole
swarms of butterflies (Oeneis Semidea),
so that, as Professor Samuel Scudder
has said, so far as insect species are
concerned, "in ascending Mount Wash
ington we pass, as it were, from New
Hampshire to Northern Labrador and
I the southern extremity of Greenland."
Similar species occur also on the sum
mit of the Rocky Mountains. The story
is the same. Dispersed far and wide
during the glacial period, these insects
have at last been compelled to take
refuge on .the summits of the high
mountains, .where alone glacial condi
tions perpetually prevail.

NEWS OF THE WAR.
THE attention of the world is now fixed upon the Far
East, where Russia and japan are locked in the ter
rific struggle that possesses so many, elements of
menace to the civilized world. In this duel of
Eastern nations the world is vitally concerned [and news
of every incident of the war,, great or small, is of impor
tance. As a -newspaper of the first rank. The Call has
taken every precaution to report completely the progress
Arrangements have been made to secure the first news
and the best reports. Seasoned and intelligent corre
spondents have been placed at the scene of hostilities and
the readers of The Call may be assured, that this paper
will be true to its traditions and publish the best accounts
of the momentous happenings of the Far East.
Every reliable news agency in Europe and America
and at the scene of war has been called into service by
The Call, and it willghe the purpose of this paper, to sus
tain its reputation for publishing exclusive news of inter
national events. The expense to which The Call has been
placed in its desire to be first in the presentation of accur
ate news is naturally great, but there is ample compensa
tion for its enterprise in the confidence of the public
that this journal gives nothing to sensationalism, colors
nothing for profit and contributes nothing to the bias of
whatever interest may be involved.
There is hardly a capital in Europe that is not deeply
concerned in this clash of the Eastern giants. Affairs in
the Orient have moved rapidly to international complica
tions, and the commercialism of Europe as well as of
America has drawn many nations within the danger line
of this controversy in which Russia and Japan have re
sorted to the arbitrament of arms. The diplomatic re
flections of this Eastern struggle arc, therefore, of equal
if not more moment than the progress of clashing armies
and navies, and The Call has enlisted the energies of
capable special correspondents in every European capital
to follow faithfully the course of diplomatic criticism
and influence that may be exerted during the strife of the
actual combatants.
That no avenue of news opening upon this Eastern
lield of grave events may be neglected The Call has se
cured the services of Oscar King Davis as special corre
spondent in the Orient. Mr. Davis is a man of high in
telligence and wide experience. He is completely familiar
with Eastern Asia, having served with distinction as a
special correspondent in the Philippine war and in the
advance of the allies upon Peking.
His reports displayed a marked ability and a rare
judgment, and his activity made him first in the exploita
tion of important news. He has, therefore, much to be
speak his fitness and to promise a splendid performance.
In connection with the complete news service The Call
will fortify its presentation of Eastern events withappro
priate illustrations. â¢ This journal has won the enviable
distinction of being thegbest daily illustrated newspaper
in the United States, and it is now prepared to present
pictorially as well as graphically the great affairs that ar;
agitating Asia and throwing shadows of portentous im
.port upon the rest of the world. It is with" confidence,
therefore, that The Call pledges to its readers a service
that will be surpassed by no other newspaper in ; the
world, and which will be equaled by few.
The, world lias been informed that the rebels have won
a glorious victory in Uruguay. This as far as it goes is
in keeping with the traditional rights and privileges of
South American republics, but what is it all about? The
rebels probably know or care no more about the cause
than we. It is enough that the worthy people of Uru
guay are contributing measurably to civilization by mur
dering one another.
CONFESS THEIR OWN SINS.
THESE wintry days are occupied by the Democrats
in Congress in making political speeches, in which
they freely, and with much unction and vocifera
tion, confess the sins of the Republican party. They
usually erect a background of their own virtuous inten
tions and then throw upon it moving pictures
or Republican transgression. Their careful omis
sion of self-examination and confession of their
own "sins reminds one of the new convert in a
religious revival who, in his first experience meeting,
dwelt at length upon the sins of his neighbors. Finally
the preacher said to him: "Brother, confess your own
sins." The convert replied: "Brcthen, I can't, while the
grand jury is in session."
They attack' the President for everything he has done.
But that is the fate of all Presidents who by great cir
cumstances have been called to high action. Jefferson,
Jackson, . PoJk, Lincoln, Cleveland, McKinley, and now
Roosevelt, within the constitutional limit of their power,
were compelled to prompt use of executive authority, and
the same system of attack has been used on them all.
After such a President is seen in perspective history,
with the approval of his countrymen, writes that he was
the savior of his country's honor and the promoter of
her glory.
The present Democracy is repeating a tale oft told,
but it follows so closely upon similar attacks on Mc-
Kinley that it falls upon unapprcciative ears. Without
consistency "or coherence of policy, or accord upon a
candidate, the minority is composed of leaders each of
whom is leading in a different direction. Their condition
was illustrated in an incident in the House. One of them
was extolling the' merits of Judge Parker, during a polit
ical speech, when a Republican member asked him if he
knew Judge Parker's postoffice address. He admitted
that he did not. He was then asked: "Do you know
Judge Parker's given name?" and was compelled to an r
swer that he did not. The rest of that eulogy remains
unuttercd. Another, wiser than that to go into a bill
of particulars, uttered the reason for keeping the party
in the. field at all by saying they "could -already smell
the fruits of victory." That savory smell from the of
ficial kitchen is mighty attractive and without it the ranks
would be thin, indeed. â¢ ; â¢' ' ,
Their treatment of the President is most unwarranted.
It is known that he has frankly disclosed everything
known to him and the State Department about the Pan
ama mitter. The Democrats s know that Panama has
been in active or repressed revolution against Bogota
for sixty years. No outside aid or comfort has been
needed to. start a revolution there at any time, and none
was needed 'nor offered now. The conditions on the
isthmus have always been intolerable and it is a com
pliment to the isthmians that they, have- ceaselessly re
sisted them by continued and chronic revolution. â¢
Under such circumstances to accuse the President "ot
promotion of revolution and then to imply, ihat he has
concealed anything from inquiryandnkept back informa-
tion from Congress is insulting to him and disgraceful
to the country. But the grand jury is in session. It is
composed of the American people, who distinguish clearly
between patriotism and proper public policy, and a de
sire to manufacture an artificial issue in politics. The
people understand why the minority leaders so volubly
confess. the sins of their neighbors. .
The imitative faculty of the Chinese, marvelous in its
power of adaptation, has taken a new form in its con
tact *with occidental civilization. A young Mongol ma
tron is suing her coolie "native son" husband for divorce
in this city on the ground that she wasVa minor when

the sting of knowledge in her brain has not been di-
OF PALEONTOLOGY.
AN Eastern paper girds enviously and with a show
of wit at the discovery in South America of a
perfect fossil specimen of the ichthyosaurus. The
envy is directed at the University of California, because
the find was made by an astronomical expedition under
its auspices. The wit is exploited' because, astronomers
discovered something novel embedded in the earth. The
Eastern critic regretfully and economically remarks that
this "tiny bit, of fun' is not a fair offset to the cost, in
money and time, of these utterly useless bones."
It is strange that in this day an intelligent newspaper
man should take such a view of discoveries in paleon
tology. If a new fact in the life of Alexander or Caesar
or Napoleon, bearing upon the career of either and 'ac
counting for things that had heretofore been the despair
of history, were discovered, probably the same news
paper would regard it of such importance as to give it
columns of space. But it would be a. discovery clearing
and illuminating human history, which w'e are making
and adding to every day. On the other" hand, the revelat
ions of geology write the history of the planet on which
we live. They reveal its physical changes and bear upon
its origin and the eternity in which the natural laws of
matter and motion were fitting it for the Alexanders and
Caesars and Napoleons, and the countless generations
of men.
Fossils, the remains of ancient life, arc not a modern
discovery. They were known anciently, but were mis
understood and taught man no useful lesson. The reli
gious teachers of the people declared that the fossil forms
of beasts, birds and fishes and of the mighty amphibians
were manufactured by the devil and placed where men
could find them in order to discredit the account of crea
tion in Genesis and throw doubt upon the data finally
used in Bishop Usher's chronology. But astronomy and
geology combined to emancipate the mind of man from
these superstitions. Geology read the . mighty inscrip
tion carved on the granite by the glaciers. It revealed
the life that was upon the world when it was trodden
by animals and its atmosphere cleaved by the wings of
birds extinct vast cons before the time fixed in pious
chronology for creation, according to the story told in
Genesis. To "reverent reflection this vast extension of
time, giving to the solid earth an age so venerable that
years are useless as.unit^ in its statement, instead of be
littling the source of the spiritual aspirations of man, dig
nified it inexpressibly.
The great lizards and winged serpents and grotesque
monsters that lived and fed. and fought and died upon
the earth befdrc man was, and whose mighty bones have
been preserved, are the chapters in the history of the
planet. They tell the story of the evolution of life, of
that biological succession which is unbroken, from the
first pulsation of existence that quivered in the proccea
tive mud slime, up to man. Instead of detracting from
his dignity it put the ages under his feet, as the founda
tion of his spiritual self-cojisciousness, the pedestal on
which he stands as the noblest manifestation of life, the
physical finality, in which the fervor of evolution, the
unchecked impulse of nature forward, has caused the as
piration to a further step, by evolution into a spiritual
world and a life raised above this, as it is raised above
that of the great monsters through whose mighty fibers
it was transmitted to us.
Politics, partisanship and the slapbang of political
buncombe appear to have the field at present in Congres
sional debates. Our worthy lawmakers should modify
their zeal for their party in the cooling thought that we
know as well as they that this is a Presidential year.
Works, not words, however, make the, strongest and most
convincing appeal for votes.
THE CANAL AND OUR MARKETS.
L AST year Liverpool and London took 600,000 cases
of California canned fruits, shipped around the
Horn, crossing the Equator twice. When we have
the Panama canal we can sell our canned fruit in Eu
rope cheaper than right here in California. The shorter
voyage will mean lower freight. These fruits are canned
in duty paid tin and sugar. When these are re-exported
the Government pays back to the exporter 99 per cent of
the duty. That drawback willpay. the freight, and bur
canned goods will be landed in Europe at a price that will
not only hold the market we have but will indefinitely ex
tend it. As the reduction of our perishable fruit to a
form in which its keeping capacity is unlimited is of the
highest value to our horticulture, so facilities for reach
ing market *as a means of. encouraging and increasing
such reduction become of first importance.
It is believed that with proper storage arrangements a
large part of our fresh fruit crop will also find a profit
able market abroad. Pears and citrus fruits may surely
go by way of the canal, and the superior quality they
have should make their, market. It is hardly possible to
overestimate the favorable effect of putting . every or
chard and vineyard in California more than io,coo miles
nearerby water to a market. It is as if every tree and
vine and the climate that makes them productive were
moved and relocated that much nearer to the" con-
sumers.
Not only should the fruit-growers of California con
template this with the liveliest expectations, but they
should in every way sustain the President and hold up
his hands in his brave effort to. give us the canal at the
earliest possible moment. .
A warning has been sent to the counties of California
to hasten their exhibits at â¢ the St. Louis Exposition.
The. time for preparation, shipment and installation is
very short and the exhibitors of California should not
forget that first impressions are generally the standard
of comparison. California should I e able to open the
doors of her building on the first day of the : fair with a

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES...
Only a Picture.
The bent, black-clad form of the lit
tle old woman who for an, hour had
been slowly walking up and flown in
front of the big furniture warehouse
seemed to become infused with new life
when she heard the voice of the auc
tioneer calling for bids on various ar
ticles of furniture and bric-a-brac that
strewed the floor of the big building.
At the first sound of his voice
she straightened up, gazed furtively
around, darted into the building and did
not stop until. she had pushed her way
through the crowd and secured a posi
tion at the- feet of the auctioneer.
Once there she resumed her bent at
titude, occasionally raising her eyes
and peering sharply through her veil
at the articles the. man with the loud
voice held up for sale to the highest
bidder. When he offered for Inspection
a frame containing the picture of a
bright-faced boy about 5 years of age
the little old woman raised her veil
and took from beneath her tattered
shawl a lean purse. "This is a valu
able frame, gentlemen," said the auc
tioneer. "Selected wood; made years
ago after a fashion now extinct; add it
to your collection of antiques; take the
picture*, out If yon do hot want It; give
me a bid.','
â¢ "Sixty cents," came from the back
of the room. "Seventy" from the right
of the auctioneer. "How much did you
say, madam?" said the auctioneer to
the little old woman at his fee L "Speak
up." "
* "Seventy-five cents," came the re
sponse from the- thin; quivering lips.
And as for a moment there came no
other bid she raised a wrinkled, palsied
hand containing the amount she of
fered. It was all she had and the auc
tioneer was about to hand her the
picture when from the back of the room
came a loudly uttered bid of "One dol
lar."
The picture was knocked down for
$1 to a great, burly fellow, who walked
rough shod over every one In his ef
forts to reach the auctioneer and his
purchase. He did not see the sobbing
woman close to the stand: he 'did not
hear her pitiful cries. Neither did he
see the expectant look In her tear
dimmed eyes as he took the picture
from the auctioneer. Only the latter
saw the little old woman dart to the
rubbish heap where the purchaser, sat
isfied with the frame, had thrown the
picture of the boy. Only the auctioneer
saw her pick it up, furtively kiss it and
put it under her faded shawl. He said
nothing, but when he called for the
next bid there was a quiver in his voice.
Judicial Clemency.
Several attorneys who happened to
meet In the District Attorney's office
the other day were discussing: the
peculiarities . of judges of the criminal
courts. Two good stories were related
of ex-Judare D. J. Toohy.
Two prisoners had been convicted of
robbery, and as they had both served
terms before the Judge sentenced each
to serve twenty years in Folsom pen
itentiary. One of them remarked in a
surly tone: "You might as well make
it life." The Judge quickly replied,
"Very well, I will be glad to accom
modate you," and the sentence of the
prisoner was changed to imprisonment
for life. The one who got twenty years
is again a free man, but the other i3
still in the penitentiary.
In another case of robDery the pris
oner was the son-in-law of a ward pol
itician. His father-in-law called upon
the Judge and begged him not to send
the young fellow to San Quentin for
the sake of his family. "All right,"
replied the Judge, with a twinkle in hi3
eye, "I won't send him to San Quentin."
When the day for sentence arrived the
Judge ordered the prisoner to be con
fined in Folsom penitentiary for twenty
years to the surprise and disgust of his
father-in-law, through whose efforts
he was pardoned", however, after serv
ing three years.
One on Senator Lukens.
At a recent session of the Legisla
ture, on a certain occasion. Senator
Lukens of Alameda was making a
scholarly and forceful argument in
behalf of a bill which he had intro
duced and, as was usual When the
gifted young legislator from the City
of Oaks was speaking, he had the un
divided attention of the Senate. His
colleague and seat mate. Senator Ed
ward K. Taylor, toward whom the
speaker slightly turned as he address
ed the President of the Senate, was
closely following every word, and as
Senator Lukens finished one branch
of his argument Senator Taylor whis
pered a few words to him. >.
Senator Lukens, who is blessed with
a nose of Napoleonic proportions, con-'
tlnuing his speechÂ»-Â«aid: "Mr. Presi
dent, another point has just been sug
gested by the Senator who sits under
my nose." Senator Oneal of Santa
Clara was on his feet in an instant. '
"Mr. President, a point of informa
tion: Which one of the Senators?"
Whereat the pent up attention of the
members of the Senate relieved itself
in a roar of laughter that must have
been audible over in the Assembly
Chamber.

Origin of Petroleum.
Chemists at one time believed that
petroleum was formed in the depths
of the earth r by v the action of water
working on metallic carbons in a state
of fusion. Now this statement Is chal
lenged by some geologists, who con
tend that petroleum la the result of
putrefaction of animals who have been
swallowed in some enormous cata
clysms similar to Mont Pelee. This
upheaval, says Professor Engler,
burted millions of prehistoric quadru
peds, lizards, serpents and sea mon
sters, and during all the cycles of
year3 that have elapsed since then the
bodies of these animals have been dis
tilled by Mother Nature in her Im
mense laboratory beneath the earth's
surface. The result of this distilla
tion Is the valuable product that we
know as petroleum.
Some Keppel Anecdotes.
Many are the stories to?d of the latÂ«
Sir Harry Keppel, the old English ad
miral. Illustrating, the extraordinary
daring and bravery of the man. OneÂ©
when commanding a frigate about to
sail for the Cape he conceived the idea
of transporting the statue of -Queen
Victoria at Portsmouth to- Cape Town.
With a party of his middies he landed
at night to carry the statue off, but the
vigilance of the town police, who sur
prised and arrested the marauding
party, frustrated the plot. On another
occasion his ship, the Raleigh, was in
danger of sinking 1 , and he ran her into
a French port. As the ship entered
the harbor a French vessel fired a
salute. Sir Harry, notwithstanding
that his ship was fast filling with,
water, ordered his men to respond to
the greeting. With the water rushins
in at the portholes, the sailors manned
the guns and every gun on^board fired
round after round of ammunition, until
all the powder In the magazine was ex
hausted.
France's Farmers.
In France, as in the United States,
agriculture engages fully one-half of
the population. Since 1822, when the
Institute of Roville was founded by
Dombasle near Nancy, , the French
free training system 'has, with many
ups and downs, gradually extended
until it covers all France and all
forms of soil culture.
French children, under government
training, are first put in primary
schools, thereafter to pass up through,
al! departments to the National Insti
tute. It must be admitted that the
term "French peasant" means some
thing vastly more than a farmer of.
any other nation. When the French,
boy emerges from the institute he ia
no yokel, but an educated man who
can make the most of the smallest
area of soil. He knows familiarly all
life on the farm, animate and inani
mate; also all objects, organic and in
organic. He is fully equipped to cre
ate wealth from the smallest means.
Through him we understand the vast
combined wealth of the French peas
antry. Were such a system in vogue
and compulsory in America, forty
million farm workers would be elevat
ed from a homely and commonplace
existence to an educated mass, capa
ble of wresting untold riches out of a
vast soil which to-day is often worked
in the most ignorant and. hum-drum
manner, producing a mere living per
family and generally mortgaged be

by a Special Officer in the
Act of Purloining Goods
CHASED
AND CAPTUKED
Confess to the Police That
They Have Been Doing: Jobs
of Similar Nature in City
Walter Morris and J. J. Wilson were
arrested early yesterday morning by
Special Officer Murphy -and Policemen
Rivh! and Meredith on Grant avenue
and locked up in "the tanks" at the
City Prison pending further develop
ments.
Murphy detected them in the act of
breaking the front window of the men's
furnishing store at 3 Grant avenue.
They ran and Murphy blew his whistle,
Riehl and Meredith responding. The
crooks were soon overtaken and hand
cuffed. When searched a number of
articles were found in their possession,
including four shirts, four pairs of
drawers, 'a pair of socks, two revolvers,
two pairs of punchers, a chisel, two
shoemaker's knives, an awl and a pair
of shoes.
About an hour previous Policeman
Ring had discovered that the front
window of L. Costa's shoe shop, atTMKHi
Pine street, had been broken. He found
two pairs of shoes in the vestibule of
the house next door and another pair
on the street in front of the shop. The
shoemaker's tools found on Morris and
Wilson were stolen from Costa's shop.
Both prisoners are young men, and
the police say they answer the descrip
tion of the masked robber and his ac
complice who held up James Corcoran,
the night bartender in Murphy's sa
loon, at Tenth and Market streets, last
Tuesday morning. Corcoran will be
asked to take a look at them to see if
he can recognize the voice of the rob
ber who compelled him to go into a
rear room and remain there while he
rifled the cash register.
The police also suspect that the pris
oners have committed all of the recent
burglaries by breaking store windows
and showcases. They say they came
from New York about three weeks ago.
They did not deny breaking the win
dows in Costa's shoe store and at 3
Grant avenue, and also admitted doing
a similar Job at a Jewelry store on
Third street.
Judgments Affirmed.
The United States Circuit Court of
Appeals yesterday handed down opin

JOHN TEMPLETON GRAYSON
IS GRANTED HIS FREEDOM
Erring Son of Portland Millionaire Set at Lib
erty by Judge Mogan for Lack of Prosecution.
Policeman Bruce Must Make Search for Wraith
John Templeton Grayson, the young
wizard who, with white paper and a
daub or two of ink, produced automo
biles and settled various indebtednesses
incurred in the tenderloin district dur
ing the brief period he went out among
the roysterers by night and whooped
things up, was before Judge Mogan
yesterday on a charge of passing ficti
tious checks. He was discharged.
Notwithstanding that Grayson's
father, who is a wealthy mine operator
residing in- Portland, Or., refused posi
tively to extricate his son from this
latest difficulty, the young man found
a sufficient asset in his grandfather.
The head of the house tfent into his
war chest and settled all outstanding
obligations of his grandson. Little Wil
lie Pratt, the "boy wonder with the
freight train voice," who was made a
"fall suy" by Grayson to the amount
of $25, was in court and said he had no
desire to prosecute, as the check had
been taken up.
Before dismissing the charge Judge
Mogan handed out some large gobs of
good advice to Grayson in the way of a
lecture. The defendant stood on one
foot and then on the other, like a
naughty schoolboy, during the deliver
ance of the reprimand. At its conclu
sion he promised to wing his way to
New York immediately/ where he in
tended to be â oh, ever so good!
Policeman J. Bruce found himself up
against the real thing in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday. Sunday night a
woman who gave her name as Mrs.
Gertie Koplln was arrested for disturb
ing the peace. Bruce found her at the
corner of Harrison and Eighth streets,
dressed in the airy trappings of a ballet
dancer. On her. face she. wore a black
mask. He slipped up and put his hel
met over her for fear that the beau
teous yision would fly away. Then he
caged her jn a patrol wagon and sent
her to the City Prison.
Mrs. Koplin explained that she was
going to a ball at B'nai B'rith Hall,
where all the dancers were to be en
masque. When she was ushered into
the prison an art student asked her if
she was personating the statue of the
Greek slave.
When the lady's case was called by
Judge Conlan yesterday she .came not,
and he ordered a bench warrant issued
for her. Then he called Policeman
Bruce and told him to be sure to have
the masker in court this morning.
"I don't know how I can ever find
her, Judge," said Bruce. "When I ar
rested her she was masked and dressed
in a fluffy but scanty swarthing of
diaphanous and bell-garlanded monkey
business. Now if I run across her in a
calico wrapper washing a dog or scrub
bing the front steps, how inâ I mean
how shall I know her again?"
"Bring her into court at all hazards,"
ordered the Judge. "I want to get a
lamp at this ethereal vision myself."
To-day Judge Mogan's court will be
gladdened by the, presence of "Baron
and Baroness von Horst. Clerk Pat
Gray w^ll wear full court dress, with a
sword supplied by Japanese Interpreter
Geffney. The Judge is trying to borrow
a gown and wig, so that he may pre
sent a proper appearance of dignity in
the presence of the august visitors.
Bailiffs Hickey and Mahoney will wear
epaulettes anfr knee breeches.
The promised visitation is due to the
fact that the hearing of James SI. Wal
ter, the bell boy, who is accused of pur
loining $10,000 worth of glittering gems
from the apartments of the Baron and
his wife, will be commenced. After
"Walter's alleged theft he fled East with
his plunder, but was captured in Min
neapolis and arrived in this city Sat
urday in custody of Detective Dinan.
He was arraigned yesterday on a charge
of grand larceny and instructed as to
his rights. Most of the jewels have
been recovered.
"Lefty" Bannon, one of the charac
ters south of Market street, was before
Judge Cabaniss yesterday, charged
with being drunk in a public place. He
told the Judge he was working and
would like to be allowed to pursue his
industrial career. The Judge agreed,
on the condition that on his outward
course he would promise not to work
NEW ADVEETISEMENTS.
CURIOSITY
Leads to Inveitiffation and Truth.
"What Shall We Do to Be Saved" was
the title of one of Robt. InsersoU's lec-
tures. People of faith and people of no
faith flocked to hear it. Thousands are
asking:. "What shall I do to get rid of
dandruff?" The answer is. "Kill the germ
that causes dandruff, falling hair and
finally baldness; and the only thing that
will do it is Newbro's Herpicide. That
is the very latest discovery of the labor-
atory, and it is the only preparation thUt
claims to, or that will, kill ihe pestifer-
ous dandruff germ. It also is a delight-
ful hair dressing, free from oil or grease
or sticky substances. Try it and be con-
vinced of its .actual merit. Sold by lead-

William Hogan, William Miles and
Dan Blgelow, the three 15-year-old
hoodlums who were arrested on various
charges of burglary, were sentenced by
Judge Mogan yesterday. Their ages
pleaded for them and ail the charges
were reduced from felonies to misde
meanors. Hogan was given seven
months in the County Jail on three
charges, Miles six months on two
charges and Bigelow four months on
one charge. -â¢ 'i *-:>â¢.
Ernest Sinfi and fourteen other As
syrians, with names like 'tour acres of
prickly pear, were before Judge Mogan
yesterday for final adjudication. They
were charged with making life miser
able for the lodgers in a hotel at 210
Second street by gathering in the base
ment of Sinn's cafe and giving imita
tions of bashi bazouks with delirium
tremens. Sinn promised to hunt a new
location for his cafe and his case was
continued for three weeks. The others
were dismissed.
Peter Busalacchi, who cut Frank Val
estiere with a knife and. a hatchet Sat
urday while out in a fishing smack on
the bay because the ravioli prepared
by Valestiere was not up to the stand
ard, is" badly wanted in Judge Conlan's
court. 'He did not appear yesterday
when his.case was called and the Judge
issued a bench warrant for him, fixing
the bail at $5000. At present he is at
liberty on cash bail of $50. It is under
stood that Valestiere is seriously
wounded.
David Cox, George Williams and* Ben
Pincus were bound over to the Supe
rior Court .yesterday by Judge Fritz
in bail of $5000 each on charges of grand
larceny by trick and device. They are
accused of bunkoing Paul Van Loon,
proprietor of the Hotel Franklin, out
of $2850 by a pretended racing swindle.
The examination of George A. Jack
son, accused of wedding Mabel Nut
ting after having contracted a previous
matrimonial alliance with Annie Jack
son, nee McLane, which has not been
â¢legally dissolved, was partly heard yes
terday by Judge Fritz. Among the wit
nesses were Rev. Burr M. Weedori, pasÂ«
tor of St. Luke's Episcopal Church,
who performed the last marriage cere
mony; Mabel Nutting, the alleged de
ceived woman, and the first wife. Little
progress was made, however, as nec
essary documentary testimony \va3
missing and the hearing was continued
until to-day.
John J. Doherty has a penchant for
coming to his wife's home at "037 Sev
enteenyx street after a Saturday night
out with the "bhoys" and Â«ainin-; an
entrance by kicking the panels out of
the door and crawling througn the hole.
His latest attempt was made eaiiy
Sunday morning and his wife . sum
moned a squad of police from the Mis
sion station by telephone to quell her
exuberant spouse. He was before
Judge Mogan yesterday and his wife
wanted him sent to jail. She said he
had been arrested seven times before
for disturbing her peace and site had
grown weary under the affliction.
It was a case of "Mary and John."
"Mary, didn't I give you my wages
regularly?" asked the husband. "No,
you didn't!" she snapped. "You never
done nothin' for me except to kick in
the door."
The Judge continued the case until
to-day, and If Mrs. Doherty stands pat
there will be something juicy in the
way of sequestration coming to John.
Tom Thompson, a cocaine fiend, who
in absence of a supply of the drug
climbed down into the basement of Dr.
Bailey's drug store, at Sutter street
and Grant avenue, and yelled like a
coyote under a desert moon, appeared
before Judge Mogan yesterday. He said
he had been employed by Bailey as a
porter and took out his wages in co
caine.
At his request Bailey was sent for.
When the doctor entered the courtroom
Thompson arose and shouted. "There's
my friend; he'll save me," until the
bailiffs had to get a strangle hold on
him to restore order.
"Can you vouch for this man?" asked
Judge Mogan of the doctor. "Hardly,"
said Bailey. "He was convicted, of a
charge of vagrancy some time ago and
was sentenced to sixty days in -the
County Jail. He appealed the case and
I went on the bond. Now I want* to
surrender him into custody.". So
Thompson got his original sixty days
and thirty more in the County Jail for
his latest performance.
Robert Foulds, who refuses to provide
for three minor children and came into
Judge Mogan's court Saturday in an
Intoxicated condition to tell why he
was unable to furnish food for his lit
tle ones.-was sentenced to thirty days
in the County Jail yesterday by the
Judge. The sentence would have been
up to the limit of the law if it had not
been for the fact that the court still
hopes to compel the father to devote a
reasonable portion, of his earnings to
his family, and realizes that detention
In the County Jail will preclude a pos
sibility of this result.

â¢ The arguments oii^ the application

victed of .irsault with intent to kill.
The ( â ireurr.Pianoes of the case were
peculiar. UcGee went rtealthily Into
ihÂ« office of Lieutenant Edger and took
deliberate aim at his head. He snapped
his ristol twi<T. but the cartridge caps
i fused to explode and Edger. hearing
ihe click of Â»he pistol, jumped up and
fcrappl^d with his assailant, who, in the
>:rugg!<*. h'.t Edger several times over
; ?i^ head with the butt of the revolver,
inflicting several dee:> scalp wounds.
The noise of the scuflie brought in men
of the Ho5pital Corps and with diffi
culty McGee was overpowered and
locked u*i.
McGee showed no regret for. his ac
tions, and in fact stated at the time of
ihe vicious attack that he fully meant
r. kill Edrrer.
From the testimony offered before the
Â»ourt-martial it appears that McGee
had bf-^n derelict of his. duties and
when reprimanded became usrly and
sullen. He had also a grievance against
Sergeant M'jller and stated that'he in
tended to kill him as well as Edger, if
he cou'd. Before the court-martial he
put In the plea of insanity, but from
the findings it would appear that he
did not have the evidence to 'sustain
that pica.

WEBERFI ELDI ANS MORE THAN FU LFI LL
EXPECTATION BASED ON THEIR FAME
"Whoop-Dee-Qoo" and Burlesque^ a Big and Brilliant
Audience at the Grand O^era-'l^pQsie ih : a Stieady Gale of Hearty
Laughter---Warde and James ;at;Gp1umbia-v^ Fischer's
Before an audience that filled every
seat in the" Grand Opera-house last
night the Weber & Fields Company
demonstrated the cause of Its great
favoritism with all classes of play
goers in New York. It fulfilled all the
promises conveyed in its eulogy by
the announcements of its advent and
it did a whole lot of things that pro
nounced its advance agent a marvel of
modesty.- "They have delivered the
goods," was the only comment heard
in the lobby after the curtain had de
scended on the final scene of "Whoop-
Dee-Doo" â or rather, after the cur
tain had been raised half a dozen
times in response to a clamor of ap
proval that would not be denied, and
after Miss Lillian Russell -and Mr.
Ross had orally expressed apprecia
tion of the enthusiasm with which
they and their stage associates had
beeji rewarded.
It is safe to. assert that never did
the Mission-street playhouse contain
an assemblage more varied socially.
In boxes and auditorium fashion was
dominant and- the clothes show was
worth looking at when the stage was
shut out. The upper tiers were laden
with folk less prominent in "society,"
the upper tier of all being packed with
people who stamped and whistled their
approbation instead of shouting it. In
that one respect the opening of the
Weber & Fields engagement differed
from the first night of the last Grau
grand opera season, when fancy prices
forced mu:=ie-loving gentility to perch
as "'gods."
It was no fault of the Weber &
Fields management that midnight had
passed ' before the final curtain fell.
Special and emphatic announcement
had been made that the performance
would commence aV S o'clock sharp,
but al '.hat hour not one-twentieth of
the seats w.ere occupied and people
were pouring into the house, filling
the aisles :>nd obscuring the stage
from thu early-comers. So it was 8:20
before the curtain went up, and re
peated encores were responsible for
the remainder of the lateness. Under
ordinary conditions the theater would
have bren cmntied at 11:15.
l-'arly in the proceedings it became
evident that a splendid spectacular pro
duction was in store for those present.
The opening scene or "Whoop-Dce-
Doo," a German beer garden in Paris,
was a magnificent stage picture, even
before the chorus tro<-ped on. and then
for about five minutes there was a
rapid movement of gorgeous coloring
that had a kaleidoscopic offect. while
a big orchestra played and about fifty
girls sang, a rollicking chorus. That
was the first recall provoker, and there
after almost every choral number was
repeated.
But it was thf* individual and col
lect'ive work of the "all-star" corps of
principals that won the most thunder
o is Ii.-ii dÂ«: fp?. John T. Kelly was the
first of them to enter, and for several
minutes he was unable to obtain a
hearing, so deafening was the din. Then
came Mabel Fcnton, and she, too, was
received royally. When- Lillian Rus
sell entered, radiantly gowned and
ablaze with diamond?, the house fairly
rose and screamed - its welcome.
Weber and Fields came next, but Weber
and Fields were not permitted to speak
a llnÂ« until the audience became weary
of encouraging them with noisy demon
stration of good will. Nor could Louis
Mann, or "Pete" Dailey or Charles J.
lines proceed to business until they
wore given assurance that the heart
of the house was with them.
EVERY OSK INTERESTED.
Once the actors got fairly started to
work their artistry became manifest.
"\\ hoop-Dee-Doo' 1 gave every ojie of
them fulsome opportunity to ventilate
his or her best qualities, and not one
cf them neglected it. The piece was
typically Weberfleldian, adhering to no
conventional rule or method that might
deprive any of the performers of a
chance to say or do something that
might provoke a laugh, and the conse
quence was a steady progression of lu
dicrous movement. Among the folk in
front there was apparent disposition to
weigh the merits of the performers in
comparison with those of other people
whem they had seen in the same lines
of comedy, and in every instance the
Weberfieldians won. the verdict.
Their respective methods were
marked by a finesse â an undercurrent
of subtlety â that has never been
equaled In comedy on the local stage.
Even their lapses into what is tech
nically termed "horse play" were
managed so adroitly and with such
shrewd avoidance of overdoing that
the spectators who do not usually
relish that sort of thing were among
those who laughed most heartily and
applauded â¢ most loudly. That was
where the artistry of the actors mani
fested itself. They brought out all
the fun that could be brought out
without descending to coarseness, and
some of the things they did would
certainly have appeared coarse if at
tempted by less, artistic people.
Lillian Russell was the cynosure of
all lorgnettes when she entered with
stately sweep and faced the first San
Francisco assemhblage she had seen
for eleven years. Her personal graces
had undergone no diminution in the
long interim and a murmur of admira
tion swept the house as she confronted
it. But" as much cannot truthfully le
said for h r voice. The rich, round
tone remains, but time has narrowed
the compass. The numbers Bhe sang
did not demand any sustained lofty
flights and she sang tl.em well enough
. win encores that were unquestion
ably spontaneous.
To .wll of all that the other principals
d.l and how they did it would require
more space than can be afforded to
make a recountal adequate. Suffice it
to repeat ttiat in both "Whoop-Dee-
Doo" and the burlesque on "Catherine"
the company more than fulfilled the
most sanguine expectations based upon
its preceding fame, and that the cho
rus- vocally and in good looks, is as at
tractive as the press agent declared It
wouli be. '

THE SAN VERANGISGO,iGALL, ,-; -TUESDAY. .FEBRUARY 9, 1904.
LILLIAN RUSSELL, WHOSE WORK- WITH THE WEBER AND FIELDS COMEDIANS LAST NIGHT PROVED
THAT ARTISTICALLY AS WELL AS PHYSICALLY SHE IS THE BEST PRESERVED WOMAN NOW
BEFORE THE PLAYGOERS OF THIS COUNTRY. . '
last night â laughed during the climax
of the play of "Alexander the Great."
It was In the last act of the piece,
when the regal Alexander lay in the
grip of poison and Perdiccas was at
his triumph. This man, with the
Transvaal gem glittering from his
shirt front, would laugh at his! moth
er's funeral. He has no more soul
than a rat.
It is not a great tragedy, the "Alex
ander"; it is not of the rank of the
recent "Solomon" or "Ulysses," but it
is yet a strong tragedy,* worthy to hold
its place among true dramas, of the
class. It has the true ring of that
art which "chastens the s.pul through
pity and through fear." The theme is
an exalted one and the workmanship
is well nigh adequate to the theme.
Were it not for the anti-climatic
fourth act, wherein stage business has
to be invoked to sustain the tenor of
the upward movement. "Alexander the
Great" would itself be great. .
At the hands of Warde and James
the tragedy yields all that is best in it.
James, the impetuous, indomitable
Alexander, pausing only at the snowy
rind of the world, and Warde, the
subtle, scheming; minister whose am
bition is only excelled by his craft â
these two are at their best 'in' Hughes
and Kemper's tragedy. So many times
has this twain acted together that its
efforts have been schooled to har
monize and blend so that the. one
member of it is the foil for the other.
There is no jar brought about by in
congruities in the ensemble.. -
James, the Spartacus, the- Caesar,
feels .somewhat out of his element, es
pecially as to girth about the girdle,
when he has to appear as the youth
Alexander in the first act, but 'when
the unity of the tragedy allows him
to play the more. mature part of the
soldier-conqueror In succeeding acts,
he is much more at home. His oppor
tunity comes at the climax of the third
act when it is his will against* that : of
his minister. ' ,
Warde, carrying the more "difficult
part, has the entire five acts ; for hfs
field. His acting is subdued through
out the drama, until the final,catas
trophe gives him the opportunity for
rare skill. There he displays it with
his old-time art. Few situation's, such
as that, death scene,, have, offered
Warde the chance for.powerful acting.
Miss Alma Kruger and- Miss. Engel
Sumner do not have. the .opportunity
to assert their powers to any great ex
tent. ; The Rpxane of Miss"; Kruger. is
a trifle too ingenuous at times. On
the other hand Miss Sumner's â  Cleo
patra Is wont to demand for, herself
too much, of the stage on occasions.
The staging of the piece-is perfect.
Both as to costumes and scenery, there
is a satisfying background for, the ac
tion. One. fault, however, which could
be remedied by the scene painter: the
statue of Ammon in the second * act
is a speaking, likeness of John D.
Rockefeller. John might object.-

"Roly Poly" scored a big success ait

posed' the music of the piece, which
savors of some of his former successes.
Nellie Lynch: made her San Francisco
debut in: the comedy and at once won
the favor of the large audience. present.
Her first song, "Dora," was gracefully
rendered and its effect was heightened
with the aid of a little coonâ Fronie
Kruse â who makes his appearance in a
huge watermelon. Miss ; Lynch was
also heard to advantage In the "Tale of
the Flea," which earned so many re
calls that she. made. a-. little speech, in
which she thanked everybody. Her
specialty with Ben Dillon, "Come
Back, My, Babe." was one of the hits
of the piece and in It Miss Lynch does
a remarkable acrobatic stunt. Dillon is

Alcnzar.^
'Measured by the laughter that the per
formance evoked, "The Gay Parisians,"
as put on at the Alcazar Theater last
evening, was a success. As the play
was devised as a laugh producer and
has no other reason for, existence, it
is possibly not to be considered in any
other way, for it is pretty near nothing
considered from any other point of
view. , Although it carries the name of
Parisian, it might just as well have its
scene, laid in New York or in San Fran
cisco, for that matter. It is all about a
"night out," in which a henpecked hus
band and the wife of another man are
in company at a French" hotel, and all
the lines snarl .up these two people.
The business is to prevent them from
being detected. The by-play is funny
at times. There are funnier plays,
many of them, but few as given in this
city have had a better cast for what
might be called team work. Maher was
the chief fun creator. George Osbourne
and Harry S. Hilliard justified their
places in the play by the fun that they
put .out. Adele Block and Marie Howe
were the , wives who figured. Miss
Block's work in the last act was about
on even terms with Maher's.
Central.
"In Sight of St. Paul's," produced at
the Central 'Theater last night, was
particularly unmoral and vicious, even
to the gallery gods. It taught a story
that the love for a bad woman was
worth the sacrifice of human lives and
that only the restoration of wealth was
worth" while. The play is one of those
vil'.ainesque productions where the bad
man tells the hero not to struggle, be
cause he has been taking iron pills and
has a wrist of steel.- There is no actual
plot to. the play beyond the fact that
one man is stabbed in the back, by a
thjef and another, an erring one, is
shot from a balcony. All of these are
bad lessons for the youth that frequent
the Central. The play is staged quite
well'and the variety of scenery and the
rapidity of Its changes are the, wonder
of it. Even an uninteresting dialogue

BALTIMORE'S LOSS NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLIONS;
TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED BUILDINGS ARE DESTROYED
Two Square Miles in the Business
District a Blackened
Waste.
BALTIMORE. Feb. 8.â The cheering
ftory that the fire had been checked
epread rapidly throughout the city this
evening, and the crowds tnat all day
cursed over the tightly drawn fire lines
decided to return homeward. Unless
the wind, which now blows briskly
from the northwest, should change, it
is believed that there Is no further
danger. But the tired firemen are tak
ing no chances. Throughout the burned
district they are to-night hghting the
fierce flames that still live in large
1'iles of ruins. These fires are no men
ace, however, for they have nothing
to feed upon outside their present lim
its.
During the afternoon the wall of
Tame ste its â¢way in a southerly direc
tion toward the water. Sporadic fires
eprang into' existence and caused the
withdrawal of apparatus and men from
the line of battle.
Buildings, old and new, large and
t:nall; stores, ships, every Imaginable
class of business vanished as the fire
swept on'.rard.
As the day wore on the forefront of
the fire ncared Jones Falls, a small

IIL3JAX SKI1X TRIUMPHS.
Tremendous vftuxts were made to
block the flames. Dynamite was used

m.-nts that h?.d oaten up millions of
dollars' worth cf property.
And human skill, and pluck, and grit,

falling buildings was lost in the roar
of exploding dynamite as it was used
to demolish structures as yei un
touched by fire.
The city was under the strictest mili
tary control. All around the "burned
area was stretched a cordon of soldiers,
why held up all comers at the point of
the bayonet. Police brought from the
neighboring cities' patrolled the dis
trict and at the limits of the fire zone
paced armed sentries. In the early
morning hours the army of fire fight
ers worked against overwhelming odd?,
but when day broke the flames were
raging along the wharves and focused
about the great powerhouse of the
United Railways Company, which sup
plied the power for all the s'treet rail
ways of the city. Then the flames ate
tholr way with undiminlshed force
southward, following the line of Jones
Falls, and were finally checked near the
water's rdge at West Falls avenue, in
the southeast section of the city. There
they continued to burn to-night, but
only in spots and with diminishing
fierceness.
STATELY STRUCTURES RAZED.
The bumod area is a scene of com
plete devastation. Numberless build
ings that were the pride of Baltimore
were destroyed, only smoldering debris
of walls or remnants of \vall3 remaining
to mark the site?. The Baltimore
American building, one of the finest, is
now but a ruin. Across South street,

front remain. Entire blocks Just be

street down Holliday as far as German
there Is no building left, save the Corn
and Flour Exchange at the corner
of German street. That building, whose
walls tower above the crumbling debris
of what are adjoining structures, was
gutted and the standing walls formed
a caldron, the flames of which burst
at times through the windows, but
could cause no further damage. ? In
numerous other wrecked buildings the
flames played about the debrla and

Army of Firemen, Aided by a Muddy Little Stream,
Finally Conquers Flames After Battling More
Than Twenty-Eight Hours.
BALTIMORE. Feb. S. â When dark
ness fell to-night the people of the
stricken city knew the worst was over.
The flames, which for. more than
twenty-four hours had swept resist
lessly through the heart of the city,
were checked. An army of firemen
from many cities, working heroically
and aided by a muddy little stream,
finally conquered.
Worn by a night and day of terror,
the great crowds that w'atched- the
ruin. of their. city turned homeward
and at midnight the streets were de
serted save for the police and mili
tary, who guarded the burned area.
-To" the south a red, glow rises and
falls, marking 140 acres of devastation
âeighty-five squares of property that
yesterday ' represented values to the
extent of from $75,000,000 to $125,
000,000. Not even a' close approxi
mation can be made of the: loss. :-â , No
guess can be made of the insurance.
An expert, the city Building In
spector, estimates the loss in buildings
alone at $150,000,000. On the other hand,
it is said, some estimates do not place
the total Ifss at a greater figure. So
far there has been no systematic at
tempt to fix the values that were rep
resented in the disaster in that which
is to-nteht a devastated waste.
One factor that will figure largely in
the final estimates consists of the se
curities in the banks and trust com
panies whose homes were destroyed.
Their vaults and safes to-night are In
the ruins, covered by tons of debris.
Experts who have given them as close
examination as posslbleexpress the be
lief that the contents are safe.
On the correctness or falsity, of this
belief depends many millions of dol
lars.
Not a single life had been lost and not
a human being has been even danger

XO APPEALS FOR J&D.
So far there has been no call- for
aid. Proffers of assistance have "come
from many quarters, from sister cities.

from corporations and from privata
citizens, but Baltimore 'to-night can
not say whether or not it will be needed

WAR DEPARTMENT SENDS FEDERAL TROOPS TO BALTIMORE
TO AID THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES IN POLICING THE CITY
BALTIMORE, Feb. 8.â With eighty-five of the finest business blocks in the city destroyed, a fire loss estimated at $150,000,000 to
$200,000,000, 50,000 men and wpmen thrown out of employment in the dead of winter and business in all directions at a standstill from the terror
which has beset the entire community since Sunday morning, Baltimore is sadly contemplating to-night the smoldering ruins of what was the heart
of the city. After working like demons for more than twenty-eight hours, an army of firemen from this and every other city within reach on the
Atlantic seaboard at 3 o'clock this afternoon succeeded in getting the conflagration under control, although not until it had broken out afresh
earlier in the day and threatened the destruction of the entire city. Not until it had swept over 140 acres of property was its destructive force
abated, and Baltimoreans are loud in their praise to-night of the volunteers from New York and other cities, wlM had arrived in the nick of time
to lake the places of the local firemen, who had been exhausted by the gigantic and seemingly hopeless fight they had on hand. The only consola
tion the city has is that such a disaster should have resulted in not a single death, and that the flames were stopped before they could accomplish
their seeming purpose of destroying not only the business section, but the residence sections as well. The city to-night is almost in darkness. Only
the dull red glow from many acres of ruins lights the burned district. Martial law is in force.

building caught fire a number of times
and whenever the doors were thrown
open a shower of sparks was carried

that the number of persons thrown
out of employment will reach 50,000.
Others have estimated the enforced

IIEItOIC FIRE FIGHTERS.
All of the out of town fire compa
nies, because of the utter exhaustion
of the local men, were given a free
hpnd during the morning and early
afternoon. Mure than a score of com
panies were here from New York. Phil
adelphia. Wilmington, Washington and
small towns within a radius of fifty
miles of Baltimore. Their duty was to
( heck the flames in their onward
march southward. This was a rather
difficult task, as both sides of Jones
Falls Â«re lined with lumber yards and
old buildings which proved to be tin
der boxes. At every street the stream
is spanned by a small bridge and on
each bridge two and sometimes three
engines were standing, taking water
from the creek-
The New York firemen, who were the
last to arrive, were the last to stand
the brunt of the flames and when the
lire began to burn Itself out in the
coalyard of the American Ice Company
seven of their steamers were backed
â¢ up against a bulkhead of the pa
tapsco River..
The burned district, comprising 140
acres of a rough dra\vn risht angle
triangle, to-night is pued with heaps
and masses of brick, stone and twisted
iron, from which occasional walls of
the more substantial structures tower,
some seemingly iesdy to fall at any
instant. Flames still rising from many
of the ruined buildings and the burn
ing gas from the broken mains give
light for the firemen, who are pressing
steadily inward from the border of the
burned region.
KEEPING BACK THE CROWDS.
The cordons of guards completely en
circling the fire area have restricted the
number of spectators within a mini
mum, ropes being stretched across the
entering ttreets, with the armed mem
bers of the Federal and National Guard
on duty to keep back the crowds. In
the crowds were found not only the
inhabitants of Baltimore, but many vis
itors from Washington. Annapolis, Wil
mington and surrounding towns, even
as far away as # Philadelphia. The
gatherings are remarkably quiet aijd
orderly.
Inside the lines the streets were en
cumbered with' the debris of fallen
brick â nails, but aside from this then*
was little difficulty in penetrating any
street, the flames having so far burned
themselves out that few of the streets
were made impassable by heat.
Pratt street, running from one end
to the other of the fire area, was pass
able throughout its length and was
used as a thoroughfare by those per
mitted within its lines. Great fool
hardiness was exhibited by some per
sons who ventured recklessly into the
more dangerous streets, between un
supported and tottering walls, which
even firemen avoided, but nothing was
done to protect them, the police be
ing almost entirely confined to the
encircling lines of gruards.
The clearing atray of the ruins will
be an affair of months. Every stand
ing wall must come down and the
whole vast accumulation of debris be
â¢carted away. . v

It is explicitly stated at the War

are to serve' as a police force under the
direction of the Mayor and local au

In view of the stringent provisions of
the posse comitatus law regulating
the use of troops in States, the follow
ing statement has been made as to the
conditions which brought about the ac
tion of the military authorities to-day
with respect to -Baltimore:
Early this morning Secretary Taft
was called up on the long-distance
telephone by a committee of citizens
of Baltimore, who asked that some en
gineer officers, expert in the use of ex
plosives, he sent over from Washing
ton to assist and direct the local peo
ple in blowing up threatened buildings.
The Secretary acceded in* sending the
officers already named. Then it was re
ported that engineers were to perform
the actual work of blasting, so prompt
ly these were ordered from Washington
barracks, as already stated.
Then Secretary Taft put himself into
communication with Senator Gorman
and also with Governor Warfield, who
thought that United States troops
would be necessary^ to protect the town
from pillage and to restrain disorder.
Secretary Ta't referred to the comi
tatus iaw. whereupon Senator Gorman
and Governor Warfield both joined in
the assurance that the request from
â¢the Legislature for the troops would
surely be forthcoming after the even
ing session of that body. Meanwhile
Secretary Taft had acted, and ordered
the troops to Baltimore through the
general staff. He did so because "the
troops and General Corbin, their com
mander, could not reach Baltimore un
til to-night, after the Legislature should
have an opportunity to decide.
It is entirely competent for the com
mander of the military department to
move his soldiers where he pleases
within the limits of that department,
so long as he does not actually employ
them as a posse comitatus, without
violation of the law.
LOCAL MAX LOSES BY FIRE.
Building in Which Conflagration
Started Owned by A. B. McCreary,
The building, in which the fire start
ed in Baltimore was owned by A. B.
McCreery. the multl-mllllonaire of
this city. It was occupied by John E.
Hurst '& Co., a wholesale dry goods
firm. The building was originally
built six stories high and about nine
months ago two new stories were add
ed to it, giving the structure a height
of eight stories.
At the time of the building of the
additional stories the firm made a
requisition on A. B. JdcCreery, the
owner, for facilities for heating the
new portion of the building by steam,
the boiler used to produce the heat for
the original six stories having been
found to be inadequate.
. The old boiler was In. a faulty con
dition and it is believed that the oil
jused as fuel was in some manner re
sponsible for the starting of the fire.
A new boiler had been' placeM In the
basement, but was used merely to
heat the new addition to the building.
The firm of John E. Hurst &~Co.
was one of the largest firms of its
kind in Baltimore. It Is barely three
weeks since John E. Hurst Sr. died
and the firm at the time of the fire
was controlled mainly by hl3 son,

Great Conflagrations That Have Ravaged
Cities From the Days of Nero to
Burning of Baltimore.
The awful conflagration that has
just wiped out a great section of the
city of Baltimore, richest in historic
associations as well as material wealth
and current business transactions,
seems destined to rank with, if not to
exceed in actual loss, the great fire of
Chicago, October 8-11. 1871.
With the great historic fires of earlier
times, In the absence of accurate or
any statistics, comparison In this case
cannot well be made. The torch often
laid low every habitation in conquered
cities, some of them of large size and
population, but it is very questionable
if In any one Instance the actual, loss
of property by the flames exceeded
the two great American burnings.
Historians accord to Nero the in
famy of having started the great fire
in Rome, A. D. 64, which raged for six
days and seven nights. The loss of
life and property in this instance can
only be surmised, and from any one of
a dozen points of view.
The "great fire" of London, which"
broke out in Pudding lane, â¢ Sunday,
September 2, 1666, burned over a vast
area, but it was mainly covered by
small houses. An east wind fanned the
flames all during Monday and Tuesday
night, but fell on Wednesday, when the
fire slackened for want of ; material
within reach. It broke out again" 'on
Thursday, however, near the temple,
when heroic measures In the shape of
blowing ud houses ahead with gun
powder were resorted to, and its pro
gress was stayed. A large area was
burned over, many lives were lost and
property to a vast amount for the time
was destroyed. ':_?-^â¢â /â â  :
FIRE A BENEFIT. ;
In these cases, as- with many others
later, the damage done was really a
benefit t^ the permanent welfare of
the cities, as the inflammable wooden
buildings were. soon. replaced. by others
on larger scale, -built of stone lor brick,
The "fire of Moscow," September 14,
1812, kindled by. the cltlzensfthemselves
in a hundred places' at once as a mea
sure to. defeat Napoleon, holds place
as ,one of the comparatively great In
fire history of modern times. On the
eve of "the French occupation the city
had a population of 252,000 souls, living
in some 9200 houses. When they fled
from Its fiery precincts only 2626 houses
were left standing. , . â¢
Of the great Chicago fire, October's
to 11, 1871, we have comparatively full
and accurate statistics. The total area
devastated, Including seventy-three
miles' of streets, was three', and a third
square miles; 17,450 business and liv
ing structures were burned, and about
100,000 people rendered homeless. Over
150 lives were known to be lost, near
1000 persons were reported missing and
property estimated -in value at $200,
000,000 was destroyed. This vast ele
mental scourge was stayed by using
gunpowder to blow up the buildings. In
its front. ' ~
In the following year (1872), Novem
ber 9 to 11, the city of Boston was vis
ited ,by. a conflagration fn the very
heart of the richest business section. of
the place. Though covering but a small
area comparatively, not over 80 acres,
the property loss was' $80,000,000. about
a million per acre. The loss of life was
small. â  "â¢"â  â ' r

NO GAME LAWS
FOR UNCLE SAM
De Haven Decides That State
Statutes Are Not Valid on
a Government Reservation
DAVID LINCOLN IS FREED
Illegally Convicted - by a
Justice of the Peace for
Killing: Deer Out of Season
According to an opinion handed down
yesterday by United States District
Judge de Haven, the State his no
authority to enforce the game laws on
a Government reservation. The deci
sion was given In the matter of David
Lincoln on habeas corpus. Lincoln is
an Indian living on the Round Valley
Indian reservation In Mendocino Coun
ty. State game wardens found freshly
killed deer meat In his house last No
vember during the closed season for
deer and placed him under arrest for
violating the State same laws. Lin
coln was taken before a Justice of the
Peace at Cove!o and convicted.
United States District Attorney
Woodworth interfered on behalf of the
Indian and contended that the State
courts had no Jurisdiction on Govern
ment reservations. In this contention
he was sustained by Judge de Haven.
The following is a synopsis of the opin
ion:
The MtHIoow la Â«n Indian ward of thÂ«
Government residing upon the Round Valley
Indian Reservation, situate in the county of
Merxjoclno, In this State. On January Â», 1904.
In the Justice's Court of Round Valley Town
ship, county of Mendocino, he was convicted
of having deer meat in hi? possession on No
vember 14. 1&C3. It Is conceded that the of
fense, if any, was committed at the home of
the petitioner on land which has been allotted
to him by the Government, and that puch
land waa within the boundaries of the Round
Valley Indian Reservation, as defined by the
act of Cencrea*.
The petitioner la a ward of lhÂ» Government,
and the le?al title to the land which has been
allotted to him is still in the United States,
and the act of allotment did not have the ef
fect of excluding fu~Ii land from the limits of
the Round Valley Indian Reservation. Such
being the facts, there can be no doubt that
the Jftstice's Court was without jurisdiction to
enter the judgment undPr which the imprison
ment of the prisoner is sought to be justified.
The petitioner Is discharged.
Mr. Woodworth said yesterday that
the Indian 'or any one else could shoot
or fish at any time o-f the year on a
Government reservation, subject to the
regulations of the superintendent, there
not being any Federal game law in ex
istence, and that a person could not be
prosecuted in the Federal Court for
violating a State law.

for several blocks, the oil in the wreck
of the Standard Oil buildings ignited
and there was a succession of explo
sions with the bursting out of the
flames. At times the smoke rolled out
and threw great black* clouds into the
night. Pratt street for many squares
is almost Impassable by 'reason of the
huge piles of masonry and the water
with which the fire companies flooded
that section. The electric wires are a
tangled network and Die trolley wires
are down in every direction. At
O'Donnell's wharf, where a freight
station of the North Central road is
located^ the flames fed all day on the
inflammable trimmings of tke annex
to the power-house of the United
Street Railway, the main building of
which was burned early this morning.
The walls of both buildings, however,
remain intact.
XOT A WALL STANDING.
The large buildings, of the Miller
Fertilizer Company, the Bragener Oil
Company, C. M. Robinson, dealer in'
seeds, and the Martin . Wagner Com
pany, canners and packers, opposite
the slip from the power-house, were
destroyed and th*e "ruths .. burned
throughout the night. Many of v the
occupants of ill-fated Pratt street
were saloon-keepers and dealers -'-.in'
second-hand goods. There is nothing
to-day to Indicate that these places
ever existed, save jumbled piles of
brick. All the buildings at Dugan's
wharf near by, were destroyed. The
Hutchinson feed concern at this poinC
also is in ruins.
Stretching from here down East
and West Falls avenues were a num
ber of business establishments. Among
these the Lime Cement Company's
plant and Cockran's icehouse were
burned. The large four-story build
ing of the McCormick Drug Company
at East Falls avenue and Pratt street
was ruined. The William Tell House,
a saloon and hotel at East Falls ave
nue and Pratt street; the Hoffman
House, another hotel near by, and the
W. W. Boyer packing plants were de
stroyed.
The Commercial building, a six
story structure at the corner of Lom
bard and Gay streets, stretching over
a half block, Is destroyed, but the
vaults are safe.
GREAT TELEGRAPH SERVICE.
Western Vnlon and Postal Companies
Manage Business Despite Obstacles.
BALTIMORE, Feb. 8. â The service
given by the telegraph companies has
probably not been equaled and cer
tainly never surpassed in such an
emergency. Within twelve hours after
the fire broke out- both companies
were almost helpless. By daylight
there were linemen on the ground
from Philadelphia, New York and
Washington in charge of' the super
intendents and managers of these dis
tricts and in less than six hours the
Western Union Company had estab
lished three offices.
The Postal Company, whose main
office was in the Continental Trust
building, was forced to vacate its of
fice early last night but before day
light to-day the company had estab
lished quarters at Orleans and Fort
streets, where business was handled
almost as smoothly as usual. The
volume of business handled was enor
mous. Considering the difficulties
encountered byboth companies in. re
pairing their broken wires the service
rendered was little short of marvel
ous, i

NEW YORK. Feb. 8. â "The crip

thing within the bounds of reason to

of the Seaboard National Bank of this
city, when asked what action could be
expected from the New York associa

Clearing House.
"The association," he said, "will
take such action as the circumstances
of the .Baltimore banks seem to re

not be got out the other banks will
give such temporary assistance as may
be reauired."
CUSTOM-HOUSE RUINED.
Examination Reveals That Xcw Fed

BALTIMORE, Feb. 8.â As a result of
an examination of the half-completed
custom-house building, upon- which
nearly $350,000 has been expended, it Is
almost certain that the entire structure
must be torn down and rcbuilt.so great
is the injury found to have been done
by the flre to the granite and steel walls
of the building.

American Cities Quick to Go to the
Keller of Baltimore.
BALTIMORE, Md., Feb. 8. â Mayor
McLane to-night gave the following to
the press:
"I wish you to say for me that the
fire is now under control. The people
throughout the country have been very
kind to us in our terrible calamity, and
I cannot 'find words to express my ap
preciation. "We have had offers of as
sistance from nearly every large city
in the East and several offers from the
We3t. Of course, there haB as yet been
no relief system adopted, aa ws do not
know just how we stand, but by to
morrow we shall know what relief
measures it will be necessary to
adopt."
The Board of Insurance Commission
ers refuses to estimate the loss. A
prominent member of the board said: !
' "It is impossible at th4s time to jfive
an approximate estimate of the loss. I
would say from $100,000,000 up. It is
safe to eay the loss exceeds $100,000,
000." vis' . . â  . i
To-night the fire district and the ter
ritory immediately surrounding It are
under the strictest military control.
During the confusion of Sunday night
detachments of regulars from near-by
forts were sent to the fire district and
assistedthe police in maintaining order
and restraining the great crowds from
encroaching upon the firemen. The
Fourth and Fifth Regiments of Balti
more, sent by Governor Warfield, came
on duty before daybreak. The men,
who numbered 1200, were distributed
about the flre district, and no one could
get beyond the line established unless
he held a military pass. , Passes were
Issued personally by the brigadier gen
eral at his headquarters.
In order to be on the safe side. Gov
ernor Warfield and other officials de
cided: early in the day to order out an
other regiment, and accordingly orders
were sent to the First Regiment, com
panies of which are scattered over the
State, to come to Baltimore at once.
They arrived during the night and
were distributed around the area of
desolation. The Maryland Naval Re
serve was also called out. '. ' .
. There was some fear that with night
fall looting would commence. The lines
of troops around the ruins was so tight
ly drawn, however, that it will be im
possible for thieves to enter the flre
zone without detection.
The auxiliary policemen sent \ here,
numbering^ a,bofit 400, have been re
lieved." ' ThVSrrien were nearly, exhaust

â¢ While' Governor -Warfleld 1 and Gen

flre district. Mayor McLane, saw to it
that the citizens generally did not get
a chance to annoy the soldiers or the
police. His Arst act was to close all
saloons and there was little drunken

INSURANCE MEN EXCITED.
News of Great Flre Creates Sensation
Among Local Agents.
The Baltimore conflagration shared
with the Russo-Japanese clash the at
tention of operators and merchants on
the local 'Change yesterday, while it
created an immense sensation among
the insurance men. The opinion was
freely expressed that the great life in
surance companies .would suffer, as
they are known to hold large lines of
bonds of different descriptions, which
cannot very well avoid being unfavor
ably affected by the vast destruction
of property, to say nothing of the real
estate and buildings thereon, owned
by the different companies. But the
effect on the life companies, of course,
will be much leas than on the fire
companies.
NEWSPAPERS WILL APPEAR.
BALTIMORE, Feb. 8.â The newspa
per situation in Baltimore Is tempor
arily arranged as follows:
The Sun will use its Job printing
plant, which was outside the flre line.
The Herald Is being set by hand in

will be printed to-night on the presses
of the Evening World, which waa also
out of the burned district.
The American has established tem

in the Baltimore flre at $30,000,000.
Losses of big companies are now

HISTORIC BUILDJNGS FALL.
Many of Baltimore's Oldest Land
marks Razed by the Flames.
BALTIMORE. Feb. 8.â In its account
of the fire the News-Union said to-day:
" To describe in detail the fire, which
will so down in the history of the world
as one of its greatest disasters, is sim
ply an impossibility, just as it is hn
possible at this time to give an ade
quate idea of the loss, the number of
buildings destroyed or the firms that
have gone out of business. These are
facts that will not develop for days to
com?.
Baltimore's equipment of twenty-five
engines was almost useless. Rein
forced by four companies from Wash
ington, as many more from Philadel
phia, two more from Wilmington and
another from Chester, Pa., it was still
unable to check in any way during the
night the progress of the flames. This
morning a half dozen of New York
City's most powerful steame'rs arrived
by special train and their coming gave
new impetus to the effort to check the
flames by putting fresh men Into the
light, the Baltimore flremen as well as
the out-of-town men who arrived ear
lier having been exhausted by their all
night struggle against such terrific
odds.
At midnight the wind, which had
been blowing strongly from the south
west with a tendency to switch to the
westward, began to come in a gale
from the northwest. At that hour the
flames were headed directly for the
tenement districts, across the falls,
where frightened foreigners were run
ning like demons to savÂ« their house
hold effects.
Temporarily the change In the wind
saved them, for the flames were driven
toward the water front, a-nd all build-
Ings from Baltimore street down to
Pratt street soon were a roaring mass
of flre. From then on Pratt street
became the center of the flre, which
burned block after block of business
structures on that thoroughfare from
Charles street eastward to the falls.
Roughly speaking, the flre in its
course described a half circle on Its
northern and western edges, curving
from Lombard and Liberty streets to
Fayette and St. Paul strets, and then
sweeping around toward Market space
and Lombard street. .
The whole effect of this course of the
flre was to describe an Immense ques
tion mark.^
Among the out-of-town flre depart
ments which responded were two com
panies from Wilmington, Del. While
fighting the flames in Von Bolden's
wharf the Wilmington flremen found
retreat cut off by an explosion of the
Standard Oil Company's warehouse. A
panic ensued and the flremen yelled
for assistance. Several tugs came to
their rescue and they were taken off,
abandoning their engine. A few min
utes later the entire wharf was a mass
of flames. Among the principal build
ings which were razed to the ground
in this neighborhood were the Standard
Oil Company, the. % Patasco Oil Com
pany, the United States Fruit Com
pany, the Baltimore Fruit Company, J."
J. Underhill. W. C. Robinson, Bau
ghanes &' Son and N. Frank . & Sons.
.Dynamite proved most useless last
night, when building after building in
the neighborhood of Charles and Bal
timore, streets was blown up in order
to. stay the flames. It seemed as if
the fire fiend laughed at such paltry
efforts, for . the . flames simply jumped
these vacant spaces andjlcked up the
buildings jon" the far side.
From a point near the corner of
Charles and Fayette streets the scene
of utter devastation presented Is ab
solutely ' appalling. Both I buildings at
the cornerâ Hall, H"eadlngton & Co. and
J..W. Putts & Co.â are in ruins, noth
ing, but'a few walls less than ten feet

Board of Supervisors Extends
Limits Within Which All
Bock Quarries Are Prohibited
EX-FIEEMEX SEEK RELIEF
Petition for a Charter Amend
ment Increasing the Amount
Paid to Them as Pensions
The two ordinances providing for the
extension of the limits within which
it Is prohibited to explode blasts or
maintain rock crushers were passed to
print by the Board of Supervisors yes
terday.
The boundaries, as fixed by the ordi
nances, include Fowler avenue, Sussex
street, Hamburg street. Flood avenue,
the northerly and easterly boundary
of the House of Refuge lot and Have
lock street. \ /
The ordinances axe designed to stop
blasting operations by Gray Bros, at
Thirtieth street, near Castro.
Supervisor Boston opposed the ordi
nances, saying that it was trifling with
business men to extend every few
months the limits In which blasting Is
forbidden. Boxton said that the proper
thing to do would be to prohibit blast-
Ing and rock crushing within the en
tire city limits:
R. W. Glilogley, representing the pro
testing residents, said the rock crusher
would damage surrounding property
and called attention to the fact that
the St. Mary's Help Hospital site Is
directly opposite to Gray Bros.' plant.
A number of residents was heard in
opposition to the maintenance of the
plant.
Harry Gray stated that his firm in
tended to conduct its operations so that
it would not be a nuisance. Gray said
that he had gone outside of the limits
after they were established and he con
sidered it unjust to prevent him from
carrying on his business.
The vote on the passage, to print of
the ordinances was:
Ayes â Booth, Braunhart, Comte, Con
nor, McClellan, Hocks, Payot, Branden
steln, D'Ancona. Rock, Finn, Lunstedt.
Rea, Sanderson (14).
Noesâ Bent. Boxton, Eggers (3).
The petition of Michael Byron and
sixteen others that an amendment to
the charter be submitted to the people
providing for an increase in the> pen
sions paid to ex-members of the Fire
Department was referred to the Charter
Amendment committee. There are five
firemen and twelve hosemen now-draw
ing pensions.
timore streets the flre apparently made
an oblique cut through to the corner
of Lexington and Charles streets, de
stroying everything in its path.
At *the corner of Lexington and
Charles streets O'Neil's big retail dry
goods store, while damaged, was still
intact, but Schlessinger's shoe store,
adjoining, was entirely destroyed.
While J. W. Putts & Co. and J. J.
Jenkins & Co., on Fayette street, were
burned, the large new factory recently
erected next to Jenkins & Co. by Gens
Bros, was spared.
The Gas Appliance Company, the
Goodyear Rubber Company, Bryant &
Stratton Business College, a cigar store
and J. S. McDonald's jewelry store, all
on the Charles street block between
Baltimore and Fayette streets, were
destroyed, as was every building on the
north side of Baltimore street from
Liberty to Charles streets and diagon
ally across to Lexington and Charles
streets.
The center of Baltimore street Is in
some places ten feet- deep with brick
and debris.
The buildings on the west side of
North Liberty street, with the excep
tion of M. C. Stout & Co., tailors, were
all untouched. Those burned on the
east side of North Liberty street wefe
Bergunder Bfos. and C. Y. Davidson
& Co.
C. C. Stelff's piano factory adjoining
Davidson's was damaged by water, but
it was said to-day that 'ho great dam
age had been done.
Surrounded by fire on all sides, the
Merchants' National Bank, on South
street, was the last building in its
neighborhood to succumb to the flames.
It was not until the roaring furnace
started by- the burning of the woolen
house of James A. Garry & Son had
swept up Water street, carrying before
it banks, wholesale houses and stores,
that the building caught. It soon was
a mass of flames. Until the last mo
ment a group of employes of the bank
were loth to leave. When finally the
firemen ordered them to leave each
bexybsoyer and kissed the heavy granite
blocxs that form the doorway and then
tooVup h|9jÂ»tand several blocks below
to "s^e the laVt-joÂ£Jher."
Across Charles street the flames
swept Vto^fne towering United Trust
bulldlngr From "here the blaze spread
to Junker's, on East Fayette street, and
quickly enveloped the hotel. Lemmert's
tailoring establishment, the Herald and
Law building, whence the flames licked
about the, courthouse. Although the
granite sto'od the heat well and did sot
crack, it was scorched and frightfully
disfigured.
On the south side of Fayette street
the flames destroyed all the buildings
down to and including the Calvert
building, at St. Paul and Fayette
streets.
The nine-story Central building of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Com
pany, Calvert and Baltimore streets,
caught about the same .time as the
Equitable building, from which it was
separated by an alley. The flames made
short work of the enormous structure,
and all that remains of it are sections
of the towering brick walls.
Next to the horrible fascination of
the flames, the exodus from the burn
ing district was the most Impressive
sensational feature of the- great Â» flre.
Out 'of all the streets leading to the
northern annex a pathetic procession
made its way as early as last night,
the vanguard of the retreating army
reaching North avenue and Charles
street. This first detachment consisted
of a body of Russians and Poles carry
ing their household goods. To-day the
homes of those who fled are In ruins.
Between the marching throng were
heavy trucks, carriages and carts car
rying valuables to places of safety.

THE DALLES. Or.. Feb. 8.â Federal
and State officers are piling up a record
of crime unequaled in the annals of
the Northwest against Norman "Wil
liams, the man arrested to-day at Bel
llngham. Wash., at the Instance of the
authorities here. It is alleged that Wil
liams, who posed here as a timber spec
ulator, and who is charged with the
murder of two defenseless women in
order that he might forge their names
to rellnqulshmente, is an ex-convict, a
polygamist. has had six wives, three
of whom are still living, while three
are dead, two supposedly by poison.
Last night a warrant was wired to
Bclllngham for the arrest cf "Williams
for the murder of Mrs. L. J. Nesbitt
and her daughter, Alma Nesbitt. upon
Information filed by George W. Nesbitt
of Kirkman, Shelby County, Iowa.
Nesbitt arrived in Oregon last Satur
day and, with the land office agent
who first had "Williams indicted for
forgery, has searched untiringly to
solve the mystery of the disappear
ance of his mother and sister, who were
induced by Williams to come here three
years ago to locate a homestead.
An Investigation of the land which
the two women located and on which
they lived resulted in the discovery
that the ground under a chicken
house had been broken. Digging, the
searchers found the well-defined walls
of a grave two feet wide by six feet
long, the ground giving evidence of
having been disturbed within a few
months. At the depth of seven feet
several gunny sacks were discovered,
clotted and stiff with blood and two
large bunches of human hair, also
bloodstained, one bunch gray and the
other black, answering the description
of the missing women's hair. A
broken dish with hair clinging to the
edges was also in the grave. With
theÂ§e terrible evidences of crime. Nes
bitt returned and swore out the com
plaint. It Is his theory that Williams,
fearing that his premises might be
searched, moved the bodies within a
year to another hiding place. In the
criminal history which Nesbitt brings
against "Williams Is the fact of hi3
being sentenced to eight years in the
Nebraska penitentiary for criminal as
sault.
Evidence is found of his having had
six wives, two of whom died suddenly
of poison under suspicious circum
stances, $2000 being realized upon the
Insurance of one. Williams was ac
quainted with one Alma Nesbitt lrf
Omaha and wanted to marry her. Un

came "West with her mother In May,
1890.
When relatives of the Nesbitts wrote
from Iowa asking as to their where
abouts Williams replied by saying that
they had gone to North Taklma. When
Federal officials recently arrested him
for forging Alma Xesbltfs name to a
homestead, wh!ch he sold later, the Odd
Fellows furnished his bond. He now
claims that he will produce the two
women. A Sheriff left to r day to bring
him back from Bellingham.
was reported by the Baltimore "Weather
Bureau that the wind was blowing from
the southwest at a rate of twenty-four
miles an hour. Later the velocity of
the wind increased, but when night
added its mantle of darkness to the
horror of the fire a strong wind sprang
up from the northwest.
One of the old landmarks that was
swept away by the flames on Pratt
street was the Maltby House. It was
founded forty years ago by Edward
Maltby.
The Protestant Episcopal Church of
the Messiah, at Fayetta and Fray
streets, was destroyed. The church was
one of the most historic ecclesiastical
structures In Baltimore. It was built
in 1828.
Perhaps thÂ» most interesting land
mark that went down with tha flames
was the Maryland Institute. This old
building was built in 134S by the Mary
land Institute Association of Mechan
ical Arts. In 1S56 and I860 It was used
as an assembly hall by Democratic con
ventions. Later it was used as a thea
ter, and Sol' Smith Russell made his
first appearance In this city thirty years
ago in this hall. The building was the
center of the famous Harrison street

Pretending to be members of St.
Joseph's parish, seeking life members
for the Order of the Sacred Heart, two
smooth young men have been busy
these last few days gathering victims
in West Berkeley. So daring and suc
cessfuf were the fellows that the Rev.
Fathers Michael O'Riordan and Cant
well of St. Joseph's Church were com
pelled yesterday morning to warn their
congregations to beware of the im
postors.
This pair of "bunko" operators
worked a very simple game upon their
victims, who were always unsuspect
ing women. They affected the garb o f
priests and exhibited forged creden
tials authorizing them to collect fees
for the Order of the Sacred Heart.
Among their dupes are Mrs. Edward
Dougery of 2330 Derby street and Mrs.
Joseph Rasoiller of Curtis street. Mrs.
Dougery willingly parted with $5 for
a spurious life membership in the
order, and Mrs. Raspiller lost $4 in the
same way.
These sure-thing men are supposed
to be the same that have appeared in
other parts of the State. The last time
they were heard from they were in San

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1904.
RUN ON BANK
CAUSES DEATH
Aged Patrick Collins, Excited
by the Fear of Losing His
Savings, Suddenly Expires
DIES IN BROADWAY DEPOT
First Man to* Teach Chinese to
3iake American Shoes Passes
Away From Peculiar Cause
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 8.
Exhausted by the excitement of the
'run on the Oakland Bank of- Savings,
where all the money he possessed was
deposited. Patrick M. Collins, one of
the best known characters of this city,
died suddenly this afternoon while
seated in the Southern Pacific wait
ing-room at Seventh street and Broad
way. A few moments before his death
Collins had entered the "waiting-room,
complaining that he felt ill. As it was
plain that the aged man was sick, Po
lice Officer McSorley was notified and
the patrol wagon was called to take
the sufferer to the Receiving Hospital.
Before the wagon arrived Collins put
his hand to his heart as if in pain and
expired. .
The deceased was a shoemaker by
trade and was formerly empl&yed by
the Wentworth Boot and Shoe Com
pany at the old factory near the Six
teenth-street depot. He had resided
In Oakland for nearly thirty years and
was well known as "the whistler,"
from the peculiar habit he had of
keeping his lips puckered as if
whistling.
Collins ,was the first man on the Pa
cific Coast to teach 'the Chinese to
make shoes and from his teachings
the great Chinese shoe factories in
San Francisco and other cities on the
coast have sprung. For' a number of
years the deceased had resided at 822
Linden street with his wife, f Mrs.
Catherine Collins; his son, -Thomas A.
Collins, and a daughter, Mary E. Col
lins. Another son, Edward A. Collins,
is an expressman, residing at 953
Thirty-seventh street. A married
daughter, Mrs. M. Muntz, also resides
in this city.
The remains were removed to the
Morgue and an inquest will be held to
determine the cause of death.
BIG BARN DISAPPEARS
, AS IF BY MAGIC SPELL
Not Even a Shingle Remains of Struc
ture Edward McXaughton Bought
Only Four Days Ago.
OAKLAND,. Feb. 8.â When Edward
E. McNaughton went to the corner of
Hollis street and Yerba Buena avenue,
Emeryville, this morning to complete
the removal of a large two-story barn
he had bought last Thursday, Mc-
Naughfbn rubbed his eyes in astonish
ment, for the structure had disap
peared. In fact there wasn't a mud
sill left of the storehouse. It was as
if some modern Aladdin had been do
ing tricks with a lamp. As soon as
the astounded McNaughton came out
of his trance he hustled off to fhe
Emeryville police. The result was
that Town Justice Coburn issued a
big batch of "John Doe" warrants for
the arrest of a bunch of forty boys,
who, it is charged, had carried off the
barn piecemeal.
McNaugh ton's bill of sale for the
barn read that the structure should be
removed immediately from the lot.
He says there is no doubt that the
barn has been removed, but McNaugh
ton hasn't even a shingle to show for
his purchase. .

COLORED GIRL
BECOMES CO-ED
Miss Kegina Crawford First
Xcgro Woman to Enter the
University of California
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, Feb. 8.
Miss Regina Crawford is the first col
ored woman to enter the University of
California. Through all its years
of existence the university has got
along without a colored co-ed, though
there have been now and then negroes
among the niale students. Miss Craw
ford's coming has not disturbed the
even tenor of university life in the
least and her reception has. been as
kindly as that extended to any of the
other 2400 students.
Miss Crawford became a full-fledged
co-ed to-day. She is a student in logic
under H. A. Overstreet and in English
under W. M. Hart. Later on she will
increase the number of hours of study.
The stcry of Miss Crawford's life is
one of real heroism. A daughter of a
large Mississippi family, she had to be
gin the struggle for a livelihood early
in life. She entered the Congregational
School for Colored People at Tougaloo,
Miss, and after a long struggle was
compelled to leave and teach in the
public schools In order that she might
support herself and family. : . ,
Inspired by the teachers she had
met, Miss Crawford determined to seek
a -university degree. * She had heard of
California, and, having suffered some
what in health, set her heart upon
coming to this State and entering its
university. She arrived in California
last August, in company with three
women friends, and worked for a while
in Corning. It was too late, to enter
the university then and she waited un
til the present term opened., She had
previously written to Miss May Bentley,
general secretary of the Young Wo
men's Christian Association, and ascer
tained that* her reception here would be
pleasant.
Miss Crawford is interested In her
people, as well as her studies, and will
help the former with her advice. She
intends organizing a Bib".- club for the
colored people of Berkeley. '

Place to Meet .'With Rival
OPPONENT HAS NO WEAPON
Policeman Who Hears of Im
pending Encounter Hustles
thÂ» Pair Off to City Jail
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Feb. 8.
To settle a grievance that had caused
bad blood between them. William
Becker and L. A. Brown, sailors on
the whaling barkentine Herman, agreed
to. fight a duel to-night with pistols at
the foot of Fourteenth avenue, on the
shore of the estuary. Armed with a
big pistol loaded to capacity. Seaman
Brown appeared at the appointed place.
So did Policeman M. J. Byrne-, who had
heard rumors of the impending battle.
Becker did not put in an appearance.
He did. not have a pistol.
Byrne rounded up the missing duel
ist and sent the pair of belligerent sea
men to the City Prison. It is a felony
under the laws of California to duel,
but Becker made a declaration that
he would be satisfied with a charge of
carrying a concealed weapon against
his former friend.
Though there were denials and ad
missions badly mixing the stc-ry, Beck
er and Brown did agree on the main
issue, namely, that they were going
to fight it out to-night. The pair of
sailors had been boarding at Nixon's.
Fourteenth avenue and East Twelfth
street. They decided to leave there
and went to Mrs. S. Jacobs,' near by.
But Brown returned to Nixon's, and
thereat was Becker very angry. Words
followed, and Brown says they \vere
to meet at the selected dueling grounds
this night and end their differences a
la Francaise. But Becker was unpre
pared because he was weaponless, and
that is why Byrne found only one prin
cipal on hand. Becker was allowed to
go his way, while his old shipmate lan
guished in the City Jail.

Mrs. Emelie Colien Brings Suit

XOT NAVIGABLE STREAM
Complaint That Alameda Water
way Has Not Bern Dug Ac
cording to Terms of Contract
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 'Broadway. Feb*. S.
Because the Alameda tidal canal ha?
not been made navigable for commer
cial purposes suit has been begun by
Mrs. Emelie G. Cohen of Alameda,
against the Federal Government in the
Circuit Court for $10,000 damages.
According to a recent report made
by Major Heifer, 17. S. A., chief en
gineer of the War Department on this
coast, the stream was never intended
to be more than a flushing canal. In
the complaint of Mrs. Cohen it is al
leged that the Government has not
fulfilled its contract and has irretriev
ably injured her property.
Mrs. Cohen bases her complaint
upon the fact that while an agreement
was reached between herself and the
United States authorities as to the
value of the land at the time the canal
was dug. the damage she would sus
tain was never settled upon, as it was
contended that the canal would en
hance her property. She claims that
the canal is useless; that certain
bridges have never been constructed
by the Government and that she has
lost an income of $1500 a year, which
she derived from selling the gravel
from the fc&d of Sau?al Creek.

HILDEBRAND'S MOUNTS AT A PREMIUM,
AND FOUR PROVE POOR INVESTMENTS
Sir Tom Tiddler
First Again at
8 to I.
It is not necessary to hit a book
maker with a brick to attract his at
tention, for they are a very wise eet
of men. After Hildebraxd had taken
thÂ« first race at Ingleside yesterday
with Dandle Belle, a 10 to 1 shot
played to 7, the ring: apparently re
solved, then and there, to make the
public take a short price on anything
the popular jockey rode the balance
of the afternoon. "Hildy" had the
mount on some sizzling hot ones,
among others Thaddeus, Xorford and
Lansdowne, and all three were beaten.
His only other winning mount was
or Standard, the one lone favorite to
land. With a very commonplace card
and a sloppy track to race over there
was a good attendance.
Dandie Belle, a 10 to 1 shot, ridden
by Hildebrand, captured the opening
event. The black horse, Jean Gravier,
with Lee Jackson up. closed favorite
in the betting over Bee Rosewater and
with more racing luck might have won.
He was cut off on the far turn and.
though closing resolutely at the finish,
was led out a length by Dandie Belle.
The Toiler ran third. Bee Rosewater
bled.
Milt Jones' smart filly, Marie J,
turned the tables on Al Dobson's "Willa
in the two-year-old scramble. While
the difference in weight yesterday was
all in favor of Marie J, at post time
Willa had the call. Both got away
from the post well and made a two
horse affair out of it. Despite the hard
riding of Bullman on the favorite,
Marie J, under Johnny Daly's clever
handling, gradually forged ahead,
scoring by a couple of lengths. Sac
charate. the Napa Stock Farm entry,
piloted bv Foley. stood a long time,
only losing the place to Willa by a
nose. Mogregor was fourth.
Some one circulated broadcast a tip
that Thaddeus was a certainty for the
five and a half furlong selling affair, and
whoever the Individual was he should
visit # a phrenologist, for he is in need
of treatment. There were five scratches,
including The Pride and Muresca, and
with Hildebrand on Thaddeus the geld
ing opened a 7 to 10 favorite. The tal
ent did not strike at the flies with avid
ity, and 9 to 10 was later dealt out. It
was all a joke, for Thaddeus could not
scare up a respectable gallop. Hand
presF, an 3 to 1 shot, also ridded by
Johnny Daly, early passed Egyptian
Princess, and at the wire downed the
mare in an ordinary gallop. Camaletta,
a CO to 1 shot, took the show from Foul
Play. Bucolic received scattering sup
port, but ran poorly.
For an even money favorite Xorford
made a rare showing in the mile and
fifty yard selling run. As Hildebrand
had the leg up the big Empress of Nor
folk horse was plunged on. and finished
third, beaten eight lengths for the place
by First Chip. The latter horse made
all the running, and in a hard drive
was led out less than a length by Bou
tonniere, a 13 to 1 outsider, well ridden
by Foley.
After opening favorite for the seven
furlong selling number for three-year
olds, Hulford was dethroned by Stan
dard, the mount of Hildebrand. Hul
j ford led for two-thirds of the route,
"then began to tire. Standard ran garae
\y. and taking the .lead the last eighth
won almost easilv. Ruvla ran a dis
tant third.
Again Sir Tom Tiddler furnished a
surprise. Mike Daly's big horse was
cne of six starters in the final six-fur
long spin. He looked outclassed by
such mudlarks as Albemarle. Matt Ho
gan and Lansdowne, for which reason
6 and S to 1 was laid about him. Tid
dler was hustled along from the start
by Johnny Daly, and though Albemarle
proved a trifle troublesome Tiddler
forged his way- to the front, getting the
decision cleverly by more than a length.
Matt Hogan took the show from the 6
to 5 favorite, Lansdowne.
XOTES OF THE TRACK.
Martin Nathanson, the capable secre
tary of Harlem track, Chicago, was a
visitor at Ingleside yesterday.
E. Tierney lost the useful mudlark
Albemarle from the last race. The geld
ing was claimed for 5725 by J. Quinlan,
owner of Marelio. Tierney claimed Al
bemarle from a selling event some
weeks ago.
Johnny Daly, who is riding in splen
did form, finished first on three win
ners. When he can make the weight
Johnny has few superiors in the saddle.

DEFENSE READY, TO GO
OX WITH BOTKIN TRIAL
Attorney George A. Knight Makes
Formal Announcement to That
Effect to. Judge Cook.
George A. Knight, attorney for Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin, charged with the
murder of Mrs. Elizabeth P. Dunning
by sending her a box of poisoned
candy to Dover, Del., appeared before
Judge Cook yesterday morning.
There was a smile on his face as
he said: "I observe, your Honor, from
the newspapers, that the District At
torney will not be ready to proceed
with the trial next Monday and I want
to say that we will be ready."
"You told me that last week," said
the Judge, and nothing more was said.
District Attorney . Byington met
Knight later and asked him if he
recollected a conversation they had
about two weeks ago, when Byington
informed Knight that he would not be
able to proceed to trial on February
15 and asked him if he had any objec
tion to a continuance for a week or
two and Knight saying he had no ob
jection.
"Yes," replied Knight, "I remem
ber the conversation, but the other
attorneys in the case are anxious to
proceed next Monday."

HORSEMEN WANT
NEW SPEEDWAY
Prominent Drivers Will ]fake
Effort to Have Fast Track
Built in Golden Gate Park
PLANS TO BE SUBMITTED
Commissioners Said to Think
Favorably of {he Improve
ment and May Take Action
All the well known horsemen about
town have banded together for the pur
pose of securing a half-mile racetrack
in Golden Gate Park. The horsemen
have long felt the want of a fast track
where they can race for pleasure and
recreation, and now they have got
together with a view to having the new
track built Immediately.
When the Park'Commissloners hold
their next meeting the horsemen will
present to that body plans fcrr the new
track, together with the location where
they would have It constructed.
Foremost in the new movement are
the San Francisco Driving Association,
the Golden Gate Park Driving Associa
tion, the Pacific Amateur Association
and the Carriage Owners' Association.
A committee has been appointed to
promote the matter and arrangements
have been completed for submitting It
to the Park Commissioners.
It Is thought that the Commission
ers will look favorably upon the prop
osition at their next meeting. Accord
ing to reliable information, the mem
bers of that body are In favor of estab
lishing a track for the horsemen and
will appropriate a sufficient sum to
build It.
The members of the various associa
tions will hold a meeting in a few
days and make their final arrangements
before submitting their plans to the
Park Commissioners. The cost of con
structing the speedway will be figured
out, the location settled upon and the
minor details arranged, and then the
matter will be left with the Park Com
missioners for final decision.
Should the proposed plans of the
horsemen carry, they will hold frequent
meetings at the new track and it is
expected that much Interest will be
aroused among horsemen all over the
State. The Pacific Amateur Associa
tion plans to use the inside of the track
for an athletic oval, where most of the
amateur sporting events will be held.
OVER-COXFIDEXT CHIXESE
MAKES UXUSUAIi REQUEST
Brings Severed Fingers and Portions
of Hand to' Surgeons and Asks
That They Be Sewed On.
According to Bret Harte the
"Heathen Chinee is peculiar," but Loui
Lan Dong of 322 Commercial street
evidently thinks the powers of the
Emergency Hospital physicians are
not only peculiar, but miraculous.
Loui appeared at the Central Emer
prency Hospital yesterday in a badly
damaged condition. Three of his
fingers and a portion of his hand had
been cleanly severed and the Celestial
bore the severed portions of his
anatomy to the hospital, faithfully
trusting in the ability of the surgeons
to reunite them to his person.
The attending surgeons informed
the man that his digital members were
gone forever, but dressed the wounded
hand.
Owing to the long exposure of the
wound it Is feared that blood poison
ing may set in.
The injured man claims that on
Sunday afternoon a highbinder enter
ed his room and attacked him with
a hatchet, severing three fingers and
a portion of his right hand.

weight, who ia matched to fight Young
Corbett in this city on* the last day of
the present month, did not arrive last
night, as was expected. The train on
which the pugilist Is speeding this
way was delayed several hours last

as he arrives, In order to be in condi
tion for his match with the champion.
He Is heralded as a whirlwind boxer
and has met some of the best men In

little fellow In action- He has never
met Corbett and the battle should
prove an Interesting one while it
lasts. * "

Ing to get into condition for the com
ing battle. He will be accompanied
, by his manager. George Weeden. and
will have as trainer and sparring
partner Tim McGrath and Billy Otts.
Al Nelll and the ''Dixie Kid" are in
readiness for their fifteen-round battle
at Deitz's Opera-house. Oakland to
night. Both men are trained to the
hour and the followers of the game ex
pect to see a great battle when the two
welterweights meet In the ring.
The betting last night was even
money, though no large wagers were
made.
The promoters of the various amateur
fight clubs held a meeting last night
at the Hayes Valley Club rooms and
effected a temporary organization for
the control of the amateur fighting
game in this city' and Oakland. E. J.
Kaplin was elected temporary presi
dent of the new association.
Another meeting: will be called within
the next few days and by-laws will be
adopted and the organization estab
lished on a firm basis. Only th- Bay

TEXAN ARRIVES FROM THE ATLANTIC
WITH 11, 000 TONS OF MERCHANDISE
American-Hawaiian Steamship Company's,Big Cargo
Carrier Brings Enough Freight to Have Loaded
Half a Dozen of the Olcl-Fashioned Windjammers
SCHOONER WILLIAM OLSEN, WHICH RETURNED FROM SEA ON SUNDAY IN DISTRESS, HAVING DAM
AGED HER RUDDER DURING A HEAVY GALE. SHE WILL BE REPAIRED AT HAY & WRIGHT'S
YARD, WHEHE SHE WAS BUILT. .
The American-Hawaiian Steamship
Company's big freighter Taxan arrived
yesterday from New York with nearly
1L.O0O tons of general merchandise
stowed in her capacious hold. The
Texan Is one of the reasons for the
disappearance of the sailing ship on the
New York-San Francisco run. It would
have required a fleet of windjammers
to carry the Texan's cargo, and in
bringing it they would have occupied
more than twice as much time.
Tho Texan had the usual unpleasant
weather in the Straits of Magellan, but
encountered nothing serious in the way
of storm until within a couple of days
from this port. The freighter is so big,
however, that the howling gale and
high seas had little effect on her beyond
retarding her progress enough to make
her a few hours late.
While at Coronel, where the Texan
called for coal. Lea Howe, a fireman,
took an involuntary dive through a coal
chute. ' He traveled with the coal and
at a toboggan-slide gait. -His trip end
ed on the flreroom floor, where he lay
dazed for a few minutes. Howe es
caped with a few abrasions and a bis
surprise.
The Texan's time from New York was
62 days, 18 hours. She was 19 days
comfcg from Corenel.

ASK FOR PART
OF OREGON FUND
Fair Commissioner Filcher
Finds That the Appropriation
for Freights Is Insufficient
G0VEBX0R IS CONSULTED
Authority Is Asked to Use
Lewis and Clark Money to
Cover the Probable Deficit
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 8.â Frank "Wig
gins and J. A. FilGher, Commissioners
to the St. Louis Exposition, held a con
ference with Governor Pardee to-day.
The Commissioners have discovered
that thp freight charges on California's
exhibits will exceed tha appropriation
for that purpose. They are desirous of
using enough money of the $20,000 ap
propriated for the educational exhibit
nt the Lewis and, Clark Exposition at
Portland to cover the deficiency. It is
said that no harm can come from such
a course, for the reason that the educa
tional exhibit with others will be for
warded direct to Portland from St.
Loui3 at the expense of the St. Louis
management. Governor Pardee has the
authority to grant the request.
The Commissioners also discussed
with the Governor the educational.ex
hib!t which it is desired shall be made
by *he State University. There is no
appropriation for this purpose, but It
is hoped the $5000 necessary can be
raised by subscription.
The Commissioners will draw $70,000
while in this city, the amount remain
ing to their credit in the fund for Cali
fornia's display at the expositions.

New York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 8.â While the serious

pressing influence, the relative firmness at

13.80c and broke to 13.14c. while July, which
had been depressed to 13.50c. rallied to 13.82c
and then broke to 13.19c, all Inside of twenty

had declined to 12.41c. May to 13.02c and July
to 13.08c. this being a net loss from the net

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 8.â Heavy liquidation de
moralized the grain markets to-day, notwith
standing the Peverance of diplomatic relations
between Russia and Japan. Corn and cats
were especially weak, May corn declining 3c
nnd May oatÂ« 3V4c from the high point*.
Wheat recovered partially from the break,
closing at shout Saturday's final figures, but
May. corn nhoived a Iofs of l%e and oats of 2V4
*J2^c. Provisions were firm, the May prod
ucts closing unchanged to 10c higher.
With the wnr in the Far East virtually com
menced and all foreign grain markets respond
ing there was a daEb to buy here at the open
ing by some hitherto stubborn shorts in wheat.
The result temporarily was higher prices.
May opened Vic to lc higher at 94 Vic to 9oc,
and July was up %c to %c at 85VÂ£c to SSftc.
In a very short time, however, the short sell
ers who had turned buyers had cause for re
gret. Both May and July wheat were offered
in â  large quantities^ It was claimed that a
line of several million bushels by a large local
trader was sold out. Throwing out of this wheat
induced general liquidation and the market
became extremely weak. May going down to
9.}?Â»c. a drop of l%c from the top, while July
Boid'Gff to 83>4c, or 2%c from the top. The
May delivery, however, received good support
from the rrinclpal long Interest and the price
of that option soon regained a cent of the
early decline, while July rallied in sympathy.
The market was helped by a dispatch stating
that all offerings of wheat ' from Odessa had
Etopped. A la!Â« break in corn and oats 'had a
depressing influence on wheat prices, but ad
ditional support from the operator credited
with being the largest holder of wheat caused
a lairly rteady tone at the close. May was
unchanged at 94c. but July wan down V4c at
The feature in trading In corn was the
heavy and persistent Belling by a prominent
commission house. The opening-* was firm
alonpr with wheat. May being unchanged to
i.jc higher at 54*4c to 55c, but within the first
half hour the price had fallen to 53Â»4c. The
bottom was reached at 52c. a drop of 3c frcm
the opening high pÂ°'nt- Th* close was 52^4c
July closed 2@2Vfte. lower at 50T s c, after 6elling
between DO-'Hc and 62V4c.
There was the same experience In oats as
in corn trading, and with almost equal weak
ness. The opening was firm on war news.
May being %@>'.6<8'5sC higher at 4J't^44%cto
44 r -ic. Heavy selling by a prominent commis
sion house started smaller holders to sell and
prices started downward. The- low point was
reached at 41%c, or 3VÂ«c below. the. high fig
ure. There was tome recovery, late in the day
on covering, but the close was 2UÂ©2%c lower
ProvWloiis showed strength in Bplte of the
weakness Jn the grain markets. There was a
good advance early on an active demand for
pork and lord, but later part of the gain wan
lost on profit taking caused ' t by the break in
corn prices. An advance of- 10c In the price
of hops/ was a bull factor at tho start, as wrs

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â The foreign markets were firm,
with higher futures. The world's shipments
for the week were as follows, ip quarters:
Russian. 277,000; DanuWan, 182,000; Argen
tine, 301.000! Indian. 88,000; Australian. 255,
000. Broomhall cabled that Odessa- offerings
have wholly ceased, and that If this 'suspen
sion continues it will prove an-, important
factor in the market. - 1
'Chicago advanced from 94c to 93c. fell back
to ft34c and recovered to 94e. The private dis
patches of Mitchell. Mulcahy A Co. said:
"Most of the big commission hou*c* have
Wheat for sale and it looks as if the big
longs were unloading. Armour and the pit
are free buyers of May. There â  is nothing
urgent in the cash situation and no prospect
of any scarcity. It has been almost the rule
heretofore that advances have culminated in
war markets as soon as war becomes certain.
Prices of everything are now pretty high, and
we rather advise taking profits if the market
goes higher."
The American visible supply decreased 5C0. â¢
000 buehels.
This market was highpr as to futures,' but
the cash grain showed no change. , â â .\ : -k

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market waÂ». controlled by a few

prices of . Oregon : and river Burbanks ruled
firm. .There was a good speculative demand
for.Oregons and onÂ» large house with exten
sive shipping Interests In the Orient bought
up' the bulk of the recent heavy arrivals. It
was reported that- the steamer George W. El
der, dus to-day, would bring about U00O sacks,
and â  local retailers were operating cautiously,
buying no more than was necessary to supply
their regular trade. Sweets were dragging,
and a freshly arrived carload was offered at a
decline. Stocks of Onions continued light and
the market ruled firm at a further advance.
Receipts of Tomatoes from Los Angeles were
more plentiful than usual, being ICo packages,
and prices ranged lower. Receipts of all other
vegetables frcm ' the same region continued
moderate and prices were well maintained.
Hothouse Cucumbers were plentiful and lower.

Poultry and Game.
Poultry opened the week firm and the car of
Western stock that came in on Saturday
cleaned up quickly at good prices. As usual
on Monday, there was practically no market
for local slock and prices were nominally un
changed. All indications point toward an act
ive market during the balance of the week,
owing to the extra demand among th^ Chinese
for' the approaching holiday?, and it ix ex
pected that the receipts of Western will be
comparatively light. A few cases of dressed
Turkeys came in, but there was very little in
quiry and prices were largely nominal.
Aside from a slight decline In Gray Geese,
there were no changes In Game. Receipts
were moderata and everything cleaned up well,
although the birds were still rather poor and
thin. -

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
â  Butter opened dull, with plenty on hand,
though there was no particular accumulation
of etock. The tendency continues downward,
and there are more sellers than buyers.
Another â¢decline In Cheese seems impending.
Oid Oregon and Washington stock is a drug on
the market and Is being ofTered freely at 9@
10c. and there are large lines atlll up there,
reads* for an opportunity to be unloaded on this
market. Local dealers say that there are st
good many â  factories In Southern Oregon not
equipped to make anything else than Cheese,
and that they have got to get rid of the bulk of
it on this market. Until the present load,
which this market has been carrying for sev
eral months. 1Â» worked Off In some way, the
market will continue depressed.
Receipts of Eggs were over 1100 cases, as
will be seen, and the market was weak, with
a further decline in the inside quotation?,
though extra fine ranch still brought. 27c. But
It was a weak and shaky market at the latt<*r

now on. â  '

necessary to supply the regular trade. The
Orange market was demoralized with the de
mand light and offerings unusually large, both
In the open market and In the auction rooms.

any steadiness. Six 'carloads of Oranges were

REGENT TAUSSIG"S ADDRESS.
Regent E. J. Taussig in opening the
proceedings said in part:
AVe are assembled here to-day not only -to
commemorate the founding of this school by
J. C AVilmerding. but also to mark the event
by the laying of the cornerstone of the new
buildings. The, entire work on the. buildings
will be done, by the students and it .will be a
work of learning, as well as a work of love.
In the years to come the boys, grown to be
men, will revisit this spot and point with pride
to their own work. I hope that every student
will have a great pride In the:work of this
school and that its object will reflect to a de
gree on trades and the community. .The real
good of this school has not yet been fully
recognized, but the community .is taking, a
greater interest in It than ever. The. appli
cations for entrance into the school are in
creasing and it is a serious â¢ question to â  find
the funds now, required to fully accommodate
the students. â¢ - ...
â¢I regret that Governor Pardee is unable . to
be with us to-day, as he hoped to be. He.isa
great friend of this school and Is always
ready to help H. V I have great pleasure in in
troducing to you Professor ; lvlwood . E. ;, Brown
of the University of California. . '.-'. , ,'â â .'.
NOTED EDUCATOR SPEAKS.
â¦ Professor Brown was given a Avarm
reception AA'hen he arose to"address the
assembly. * He "stated that the schools
of Industrial arts . represented : a '.new.
current in the system of education. 'He
described the modes of ; education in
vogue the past centuries and how
they had' changed until the appren
ticeship system was reached! ,He de^'
scribed the work of training young men
for trades 'and industrial occupations,
and said that no education was* com
plete without some training' for . some
stable occupation in life. Continuing
he said: . "
We now have ' a demand fer men, "who, to
â¢uceeed, must have a general and -a specific
training In their craft. This school represents
a valuable department in the preparation' and
education for occupation. This school training
involves -.the application of general principles
to the immediate work In hand. ' '. ' i 'â¢ Â»
This work develops the spirit, and a man
Â«ees his work aa a part of the great work- of
the world. It cultivates the artistic spirit
and a man takes Interest in his work I and
product and Is not simply interested. 'in his
pay.' The spirit of the artist is Injected â¢ Into
the artisan. The training school helps to im
prove the trades that the student 'will later on
follow for an occupation.
Men will not be slaves to trade, nor mere
hangers on. They will make their. trade more
worthy of respect. â¢ They will help , the trade
by building up the manhood of the-men-em
ployed. Their work In life 1 will be a; continu
ous course of education to th?m. Men- will do
their work In a thoughtful manner. and will
make such changes as will benefit ; their, work
and product. It will help to curb the tendency
of trades unions to limit the output of all men
employed In certain work. , â¢ ' ' . .
No man with the spirit of an artist will sub
mit to eucll a proposition. This 6chool and the
I^lck School are tlie schools of the country that
give to young men a fair' training for their
luture occupations, j
PRESIDENT WHEELER GREETED.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of
the State University was then intro
duced by the chairman and he was
loudly cheered by the guests and the
students present. President Wheeler
delivered an interesting address and in
part said : \? V-> '"' ? T' â  *'
To some people It may seem a far cry from
the Wilmerdine School in the Potrero to the
State University at Berkeley, but to me it is
very clo?*> Indeed. I am here to-day repre
senting the State University in order that 1
may set forth the unity in education. There is
no difference whstever between the work of
this school and that of the university. All
honest education aims to the sa.me ends. Your
work and our work deal with the training of
personality. We all aim to make men useful
to them*i'lvÂ«>s and to society.
Education teaches men to know, to be, to
do. â  None of these conditions can do without
the other?. It is a small thfngr for people
simply to know tiling*, for it is an easy thins
to forjjet what we know. Knowing must be
associated with beine. Education must have
to do with being, as well as knowing-, for men
must stand for something: in life.
â  I have seen very bright boys go to the bad
at. the. time of testing. I have mused nome
from their places where I sought for them
and where 1 hoped to find them.
SUCCESS IS TO DO THINGS.
I am more inclined than ever to pin my
faith in men. that- stay and do things. The
men that succeed are those that are able to
do and. not merely, be. Mere existence la not
enough. We must do the world's work. To
learn to do that work we must adapt charac
ter.- Every one must learn to do something
in ctder to be prepared for life. â¢ .
That is the work, we are doing at' the uni
versity. We arc training boys not only to
learn, but to 'do:- AVe now have a system of
practical" demonstration where formerly, we
only had lectures. The, students learn "to do
the very thlnes that they will, do .later on in
life., â "
You learn here to do better than by the ap
prenticeship-system' of the past because you
are - brought... into direct contact with your
work. ' You are learning here to do tho woi-ld'a
work, to' be useful in-llfe, tovbe useful to
ycurselves and. to others. â¢ "
â¢ You hnve here every opportunity to bring
outt your , .qualifications. It depends on your
telves.as to what you â¢will do and what you
will be In life. We lay the cornerstone to
day ' to support a structure that will shelter
the work of many boys who will strive to be
useful In life. This city will be far better for
it. . It will be a better place to live in because
fhexe will â¢ be more men trained to be useful
to themselves and others. The University of
California welcomes this school to her heart.
It. believes in it and In Its, purposes, for it
embodies within it the spirit of 'the university.
- JjAY TIIIS CORNERSTONE.
The gathering of guests, students and
regents then proceeded to the open air,
where the laying of the corner stone of
the new school was to be done.
The students of the bricklaying class

The copper box was' handed by. Presi
dent Wheeler to Student* J. McAdoo
and the little fellow soldered it, up in
workmanlike manner. . ; '
-. President Wheeler then deposited the
sealed box in the cavity of the corner
stone. The student bricklayers, . clad
in white clothes, lowered the block of
granite into; place and it was "capped"
by' a* smaller stone.' '

FAVOR SCHEME
Project to Reconstruct and
Extend El Camino Real Is
Rapidly Gaining- Adherents
LEADING CITIZENS MEET
Resolutions Arc Adopted to
Further Plan of Forming* a
Great State Organization
The matter of the reconstruction and
extension of El Camino Real was the
subject of discussion at a meeting of
representative citizens at the rooms of
the Chamber of Commerce yesterday
afternoon. Every one present was
strongly in favor of the movement.
Numerous suggestions as to the best
method of attaining the desired end
were presented and it was agreed to
take steps as might be necessary to
awaken more general interest in the
proposition.
Some, of those present that spoke
most favorably of the scheme were
George A. Newhall, president pf ths
Chamber of Commerce; Rufus P. Jen
nings, executive officer of the California
Promotion Committee; Andrea Sbar
boro, president of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association; Frank J.
Symmes, president of- the Merchants'
Association: William Babcock, presi
dent of the Merchants' Exchange; II.
II. Barney, president of the Association
of Cycle Clubs: G. W. McNear, rep
resenting the automobile clubs, and J.
R. Knowland, president of the Land
marks \ League. E. Scott acted as sec
retary of the meeting.
It Avas decided to appoint a commit
tee of fifteen to confer and co-operate
with the Los Angeles organization,
which is also endeavoring to arouse
public interest in the reconstruction of
El Camino Real. It was pointed out
that if the campaign for the improve
ment of the great highway should be
fairly commenced many other roads in
the State would be put in better shape.
It was shown also that good highways
are always an indication of prosperity
in the regions through which they run.
The 'meeting was adjourned after
resolutions had been adopted favoring
the organization of a State body of
representative citizens to further the
project.

The Pianos From
The Mauvais Stock
The Wiley B.Allen Co. Is Closing Out,
These Pianos at Retail at Prices
Below What They Cost Wholesale
We bought out the Mauvais Music
Company because we secured a bar-
gain, not because we needed their i
makes of pianos, for we have our own j
line to sell. But here we have a lot of !
Wissner, Baumeister, Schubert, Behr i
Bros, and other makes received from i
the Mauvais stock, which we bought i
at a price far below their worth, and j
we are going to sell them accordingly.
Many buyers have already taken ad-
vantage of the low prices we are of-
fering. Some come into â¢ our ware-
rooms out of curiosity, with no real in-
tention of buying. One lady In partic-
ular stepped in and before leaving the
warerooms bought four pianos for dif-
ferent members o^f her family.
"We have a lot of Simplex Players to'
sell at $200 each. Electric Pianos, reg-
ular price $750, we now offer for almost
half price. A number of good parlor
organs we offer for less than half price.
"We do not want the buying public to
jump at the conclusion that the pianos
we are offering for sale and which we
received from the Mauvais Company
are cheap pianos. On the contrary,
most of them are high-grade and ex-
pensive. They are instruments that
have beon selling heretofore all the
way from $300 to $600 and, as stated
above, you can get any of these pianos
now at almost half price and on easy
payments, too.
We arc going to keep up this sale un-
til every vestige of these pianos is out
of our warerooms, and we have hun-
dreds of them to sell, but naturally of
course the best pianos among the lot â
that is tho ones that are the most de-
sirableâare going very fast, and if
any one is thinking of . buying a piano
I nnd really wants to get a piano below
what it is worth there should be no
delay in coming to our warerooms and
securing one' of . these' pianos. Store

The Supervisors' Finance Committee j
yesterday decided not to approve of \
several bills of Aigeltinger & Co. for â¢.
forage furnished to County Jail No. 2 |
until ex-Sheriff Lackmann and ex-Su-
perintendent Martin had been heard on j
the matter. Lackmann had refused to [
sign the demands and had written a
letter to Aigeltinger & Co. stating that
while Sheriff he had repeatedly cau
tioned the heads of the different Jails
to be careful in the ordering of sup
plies. Martin was spoken to in regard
to the large amount of forage .he was I
using and he stated that he would not
need any during November and Decem
ber. In the face of that statement more
forage had been furnished during the
latter month. Lackmann in his letter j
explained that he could not consistently
sign the demands, because the amount
of the forage demands during the last
six months of 1903 were out of all pro
portion, compared with the amounts
for the same period in rormer years.
The bills a're as follows:
One hundred and eleven bales of hay,
at $12 75 per ton, $201 19; forty-six sacks
bran, at $20 per ton, $33 10; fifty sacks
bran, at $20 per ton, $32 70; thirty-seven
bales hay, at $12 75 per ton, $69 55.
The committee decided to allot the
room formerly occupied by the news
paper department of the Public Library
as quarters for boys held before the
Juvenile Court.
The ordinance regulating light and
vent shafts in buildings so that the
walls thereof shall be carried up at
least three feet above the level of the
roof and the openings shall have metal
frames was finally passed by the Board
of Supervisors.

$3000 and $142 50 . for funeral expenses
was filetl by Mrs. Sarah Henney for the
death of her daughter, Maggie K. Hen
ney, who was killed on a Cliff House
