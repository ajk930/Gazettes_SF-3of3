MOTOR CAR
A SUCCESS
Rons at HiÂ£b Speed
in Test on Union
Pacific.
Epeclal Dispatch to The' Cm.ll.
OMAHA, April 2.â The dawning of a
new era in the history of local passen
ger traffic was marked to-day, when
the Union Pacific's new gasoline motor
car beat the schedule time of train No.
6 from Valley to Omaha, a distance of
forty miles. Superintendent of Motive
Power McKeen's plan of starting at
high gear has worked out successfully,
and it is the opinion of railroad men
who took the trip to-day that the prob
lem of railway motor cars has been
solved.
McKeen was at thÂ«Â» throttle on to
day's run, and about a score of rail
road, business and newspaper men ac
companied him. The outward trip to
Valley was made at low gear at a speed
of twenty miles an hour. At high gear
the return trip was made at the rate of
thirty miles an hour, although the car
is capable of a very much greater
speed.
"My dream ha 6 come true," said Mc-
Keen to-night. "Here Is a car weighing
twenty tons, with a 100-hnrsepower en
gine, which starts at high gear, starts
and stops without a jar and runs at
high speed with very little vibration. I
am immensely pleased with it."
The car will be subjected to some
minor improvements and will eventu
ally be sent to Portland.

Revive Heart Beats Twenty-Five Min
utes After Subjects Are Pro
nounced Dead.
Sji-ectal Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 2.â ln an address be
fore the annual meeting of the Ameri
can Naturalists' Society in the Univer
sity of Chicago Professor Cnarles C.
Guthrie made the unusual announce
ment that he and Professor George N.
Stewart had perfected a method where
by they had restored life to cats and
dogs dead for twenty-five minutes.
Following in the wake of the an
nouncement made recently by Pro
fessor Jaques Loeb of the University of
California that he had been enabled
to fertilize the eggs of sea urchins, this
statement was accepted by some as a
forecast that the secret of life itself
would soon .-c a plaything of scientists.
Professor Guthrie declared that the
subjects on which he and his fellow
professor worked were killed by as
phyxiation and by hemorrhage. After
the heart was stilled nearly a half-hour
was allowed to elapse before the effort
at restoration was begun. The salt so
lution used by Professor Loeb formed
an important part of the process ueed
by the professors, but in addition they
employed heart massage.
While the process enables the pro
fessors to restore heart beats and
proves that they have discovered the
secret of life to the extent of its res
toratjnn after death, the life restored is
as yet abnormal. Spasms and convul
sions seize the animals after their heart
action has been restored, and the mere
touching of the fur will increase them.
The spasms are accounted for by rea
son of the non-discovery of the secret
of the nervous system, which yet re
mains to be learned, and the increased
tensity of the spasms by the conclu
sion that rigor mortis, which begins to
set in immediately after the stilling of
the heart beats, denotes a deterioration
that begins almost instantly and which
must be overcome before life can be re
stored.
While the two professors do not claim
that restoration of life means its crea
tion, they believe they have advanced
far on the road toward it. and hope
ultimately to be able to solve the riddle
in its entirety.

MEXICO CITY. April :>. â Precau
tions have been taken by the Govern
ment and the large banks to prevent
a sharp rise in exchange as the result
of the speculative movement believed
to have been planned to take place
just as the monetary system goes into
effect. That something of the sort
would be attempted was foreseen
some months ago. It is said that there
has been extensive buying of ex
change at the present low rate in the
hope of a sharp advance.
One of the largest banks has re
fused to sell exchange to brokers and
private bankers, and has merely met
the needs of commercial houses. It is
the purpose of the Government to
make the transition to the new sys

gT. PETERSBURG,
April 3. â Last night's
affair in Warsaw, when
four Jews were killed and
forty wounded while re
sisting the military, is ex
pected to result in terri
ble reprisals on the part
of the revolutionists. In
accordance with warn
ings previously distrib
uted, every officer whose
troops fired upon the
rioters will be marked
for assassination.
WARSAW, April 2.â A serious con
flict occurred at 7:30 o'clock this even
ing in Dzika street, where a Jewish So
cialist society known as the Bund had
organized a demonstration. The troops
which came to disperse the gathering
fired into the crowd, killing four men
and wounding forty persons, two of
whom were women.
The trouble In Dzika street began
when, under the pretext of holding a
memorial meeting for a late Jewish So
cialist leader, a crowd of more than
1000, mostly Jews, carrying red flags
marched into Dzifca street and was met
by a mixed police and military patrol
of twenty men. The police declare the
Socialists fired at them with revolver*,
the leaders inciting the mob to attack
the patrol, which thereupon flred sev
eral volleys into the crowd. The crowd
removed all except nine of the wound
ed. These were taken to the hospital.
It is expected that two or more of the
wounded will die. All the dead and
wounded were Jews. The police made
many arrests. Â«
Other disturbances are reported to
have occurred. The streets had been
patrolled throughout the day, the au
thorities having expected trouble.
TERRORISTS WARN PUBLIC.
Conditions here are causing much un
easiness and nervousness. Hand-print

walking near Government buildings and
other places, as bombs would be thrown
in these quarters. Several parents
whose children are attending school in
defiance of the school strike have been
warned by letter to withdraw their chil

blown up.
Representatives of the party of vio

Interstate Commerce, has cent invita
tions to all the prominent railroad I
presidents in the country to give tea 11
. mony on the rate question before this
committee, which will begin its hear
ings on April 17. . .
Every one of these presidents, who
â will appear, will tell the committee
'hut any proposition, which looks to
â¢ Government supervision of railroad
rates, is dangerous to the business in
, terests of the country, and all will op
pose the Esch-Townsend bill or any
other measure with the same object In
view. Elkins has sent for the rail
road presidents, because when Con
gress adjourned he said that only one
side had been heard and that was the
side represented by E. P. Bacon, the
attorney for the Shippers' Association.
Nearly all the testimony before the
Senate committee at the last session
was in favor of Government super
vision of rates, and one of the argu
ments for postponement by Senators
Elkins and Kean was that such impor
tant legislation should not be framed
end passed on the testimony of one

where there was the iron door, which
originally prevented the overflow of a
torrent of hot water and which to-day
opened for the first time.
The weather was springrlke, though
the surrounding mountains were cov
en-d with snow, but once inside the
tunnel the temperature became very
high. Engineer Bradau, who had di
d the work on the tunnel, conduct
ed th<- Italian train, which part of the
way was lighted by miners with lan
terns. The train from the Italian end
was the first to reach the iron door,
but a little later the train from the
Swiss side was heard on the ottfer side
of the door. There was a brief time
spent in communicating through the
door by means of hammering, and fin
ally the door was knocked down amid
frantic applause and cries of "Long live
Switzerland" and "Long live Italy."
Bands played the Italian royal march
and the Swiss anthem, and the two
parties embraced and kissed each other.
Engineer Bradau shook hands with
Engineer Rosemund, the director of the
work on the Swiss side, and the Italian
Bishop Noveara embraced the Swiss
Bishop Sien. The latter then preached
a 6hort sermon. In the course of which
he said, "The church blessed progress."
In the name of God he then blessed the
tunnel.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 8, 1905.
WILL COMPLETE
WATER SYSTEM
Special Dispatch to The Cal\
SAN DIEGO, April 2. â The an- I
nouncement haÃ been made by Man
aging Director William Clayton that ;
John D. Spre< kels, principal owner
of the Southern California Mountain
Water Company, would immediately
rush to completion the magnificent
water system which San Diego has '
l so long hoped .for.
The lack of lain in this portion of i
the State during the last ten or
twelve years has been somewhat dis
, rouraging to investors in water sya
', tern development. The heavy rains of
, the season just past have filled the
< May reservoirs with a supply suffi-
c ient to last the city for two years.
! This fact Spreckels considers encour
aging, hence his decision to go ahead.
The first work will be the comple
tion of the pipe line from the lower
<>ny reservoir to the city of San
Diejro. This pipe line wan built half
way to the city live or six years ago
Ao a connection with the Sweetwater
| distributing -system. Here the work
was stooped because of the lack of
water, though the grading for the
; entire line was done before the work
was given up. About $200,000 will
be spent on this work. It is expected
] the Otay mountain water will be run
; ning into the city by September.
\\ hile the city is now using the two
years' supply the work of completing
j the Barrett and Morena dam will be
I carried on, thus assuring a # never
j failing supply.
ROW DISTURBS
TENT HOSPITAL
PORTLAND, April 2.â The open air
consumptive's sanitarium here Is
threatened isjith a tfctal lack of helpers
and nurses. Mis. McLeod, the matron,
has tendered her resignation, and four
male nurses have quit for good.
It appears that the wife of Dr. Woods
Hutchinson who is in charge of the in
stitution, accompanied by the young
we. man clerk of the sanitarium's city
offices visited the place and gave some
orders to the nurses which the matron
contradicted. The nurses obeyed Mrs.
Hutchinson and were discharged by. the
matron.
The recent row in the State Board of
Health of which Dr. Hutchinson was
the former secretary, has much to do
w Ith the trouble at the sanitarium.
The institution started last summer, the
patients living in tents the year round
iind eating six large meals every day.

GUNSHU PASS, 106 miles north of
Tie Pass, April 2. â General MisUHenko
has moved forward into close touch
with the Japanese and keeps up con
stant skirmishing.
Native reports, which may be taken
for what they are worth, state that
the Japanese are leaving before the
Russian front only a screen, capable,
with the help of the Mukden md Tie
Pass fortifiications and garrisons, of
holding in check General Linevitch,
and are transferring the bulk of their
five armies to Vladivostok, and. by
means of a wide movement through
Mongolia, to Tsitsih;tr. Considering
the grtat distance involved, the plan
appears too bold and almost imprm
ticable; but the Japanese intoxication
from continued success, bold initiative
: and determined perseverance, must be
regarded. The situation affords an op
portunity for Russian cavalry, whi< h
thus far has played an insignificant
role, to distinguish itself by asCftFtain
ing the Japanese intention.
General Linevitch has ordered the
resumption of drills, keeping the sol
diers occupied in the daytime, and
there is music in the bivouacks at
night. An energetic regime Is being
instituted. The soldiers are much at
tached to the new commander on ac
count of his simple, soldierly style of

Only 100 men of each detachment
returned. They explored the Russian

cutting the road and. the telegraph,

George C. Holden Admits He
Accepted 31oney From a
Company in Philadelphia
PHILADELPHIA, April 2.â George C.
Holtlen, the inspector in* the United
States i>ostal service attached to the
Philadelphia division, who admitted
yesterday that the Storey Cotton Com
pany, most of whose officers arc- fugi
tives from justice, advanced $1100 to
him as a loan I'or a few days, has sent
his resignation to Washington. Holden
declares that he received the money
and paid it back a few days later, with
out any understanding or agreement
with trje Storey Cotton Company that
he was to protect the concern against
investigation by the Postoffiec Depart
ment. He admitted, however, that in
accepting the loan he was indiscreet,
and he thought it best, in view of the
revelations in the case, to send his res
ignation to the postal authorities at
Washington.
The discovery that Holden had re
ceived a loan from the company was
made by United States attorneys while
making an examination <>f the books of
the defunct concern. The matter was
immediately retorted to VV. VV. Dh k
â feon, inspector in charge of the local di
vision, who in turn communicated the
facts to the chief inspector at Wash
ington. "
By direction of Postmaster General
â¢ 'urtelyou. Inspector Mayer has been
sent to this city and is making an in
vestigation of Holden's dealings with
the Story Cotton Company.
In a statement made by Holden he
says the loan was paid back within a
few days-, and he was surprised to learn
that it* had been entered on the books
of the company, because It was a per
sonal loan from F. Ewart Storey. He
believes, he said, that the loan was
placed on the books to do him injury.
Since the loan was made, he says, he
has sent three separate reports to
Washington recommending that fraud
orders be issued against the Storey
concern
Holden to-night in an interview said
he had lÂ»een sent to the oftioes of the
Storey Cotton Company to make an
investigation as the result of a com
plaint. While there he met Storey.
Holden was about to leave the office
vhn. in ("'H'lM.im with Stor v, be
incidentally mentioned that he had to
to put and raise some money quickly
to tide himself over in a stock trans
action. Storey insisted, he said, in
helping him out, and Holrtrn finally ac
cepted a draft. Holden says he realized
a few minutes later that he had acted
indiscreetly and made every effort to
pay the loan back as quickly as pos
sible. This he did in a few days.
Holden declares that Harrison J.
Barrett, formerly of the Department of
Justice, Washington, and nephew of
the late Jamas Tyner, who was in
volved in the postnfflce scandals, was
the attorney for the Storey Cotton
Company while he was actually con
nected with the Department of Justice.

terson, her family, friends and attor
neys have as their one important ob
ject just now the keeping of J. Morgan
Smith and his wife out of New York."
said Assistant Attorney (jarvan. who
arrived here from New York to-day to
take charge of the legal fight for the
extradition of the Smiths to face for
midable charges of criminal conspiracy
in New York.
"Do you think you will be in a posi
tion to start back to New York to
morrow night, following the hearing in
the morning of the habeas corpus pro
ceedings instituted by Attorneys 3hay
and C-ngan in resisting the extradi
tion." he was asked.
No: we prortably shall not be ready
to return to-morrow," answered Gar
van. "There will be complications in â¢
legal way piled up against us, or an at
tempt to pile them up, that may pro
lung the fight; but, of course, we will
eventually win."
What Is the real charge against the
prisoners, in plain "words?" Garvan was
asked
"Attempting to extort money with
threats against life." he replied.
The attorney would not say against
whom these threats were made, but un
questionably Caesar Young was the
person from whom the alleged extor
tion was attempted. Â
"Are the letters In possession of De
tective Aiken really nf great import
ance as evidence?" Garvan was next
asked.
"They are of vary great importance.
However, I have reasons for believing
that Ihe one rn^rte public waÂ« published
in garbled form."
Col(.-nel Shay said to-night: "I am
ready for the hearing in the habeas
corpus case I instituted to prevent the
return of my clients to New York. I
am convinced that they cannot be held
here, but that they will be duly set at
liberty â discharged."
Mrs. Smith was taken quite 111 this
afternoon, suffering something like a
spasm, It is believed to have resulted
from the worry and excitement, in con
nection with her delicate condition. She
was reported much better late to-night
by the physicians called in.

possession when arrested in Cincinnati
and to get "what explanation she might
have of their contents. Mrs. Lowell
was in the house, but none of the news
paper fraternity were permitted to see
her. It was admitted that she is re

RUSSIA FAVORS
KAISER'S MOVE
Sentiment in St. Petersburg
Arrayed Against France
in the Moroccan Incident
DEEP PLAN PERCEIVED
The Xovosti of the Opinion
That the Intention Is to
Create Mussulman Peril
ST. PETERSBURG, April 3.âEm
peror William's speech at Tangier and
the prospective developments therefrom
occupy the attention of the Russian
newspapers almost to the exclusion of
the discussion of peace. Her treaty re
lations with France and the friendly
attitude of Germany during the war
place Russia in an awkward position.
NeverthdeH the difficulty of floating
further loans in France and the ab
sence of assistance on which unofficial
Russia at least has vaguely counted in
cline the scales somewhat in favor of
the western neighbor whose benevolent
neutrality and rrontie: pledge enabled
Russia to place in the field a Manchu
rian army so well supplied 'Mth artll
lery.
Decided pleasure is also expected at
the rocks encountered by the new An
glo-French entente. The Ruse terms
the visit of the German Emperor to
Tangier a demonstration against the
enter.ie. and points out that the refusal
of Emperor William to recognize
French pretensions must deeply im
press the Moroccans to the disadvant
age of both Fiance and Great Britain.
The Russ says: "A grouping of powers
in Western Europe has begun, and per
haps we are or. the eve of great devel
opment in international events."
The Novosti sees in the German Em
peror s supposed pleasure trips to Jeru
salem. Constantinople and Tangier a
fixed plan to create "a Mussulman
peril," which is Germany's answer to
Great Britain's "yellow peril." The
paper expresses the belief that it will
result in strengthening the bond be
tween Great Britain and France, the
embitterment of the feeling between ;
, France and Germany and increasing
: armaments, but that there is no possi
: bility of war, since Berlin fully compre
hends the madness of a conflict with
Great Britain and France allied
ÃbNDON, April 2.â Many versions of
Emperor William's utterances at Tan
gier continue to circulate in Paris and
Berlin, but nothing official concerning
th-? speech has been issued. According
to ore French report. Emperor William
expressed a wish to conclude an agree
ment v.irh the- Sultan of Morocco as an
absolutely free sovereign in order to
safeguard German interests, and urged
the necessity at the Sultan proceeding
with great precaution in the projected
reforms.
A dispatch from Tangier to a news
agency givÂ«s a report that the Sultan
has already communicated to the
French Minister to Morocco his
reply to the French proposals, in
which he expresses his regret at
his inability to accept the whole
of the reform programme. The Sultan,
the dispatch adds, agrees to institute
reforms at coast ports, but claims the
right to raise loans wherever it is most
convenient for the country's interests.
FIVE MEN LOSE
LIVES IN MINE
Inhale Poisonous Gases Re
leased From the 44)0- Foot
Level by Fall of Bulkhead
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PRESCOTT, Ariz.. April 2.â As the
result of an explosion in the United
Verde mine at Jerome, owned by Sen
ator Clark, five men are dead and seven
others seriously if not fatally injured.
The accident happened just as the
shifts were being changed, and all the
men except twelve had been raised to
the surface. They were waiting at the
station of the 300-foot level to be hoist
ed from the mine when a terrific explo
sion occurred, killing five instantly and
injuring seven others.
On account of the recent heavy rains
surface water found its way to that
portion of the mine where fire has been
Bmoldering several years. The steam
thus generated caused the explosion,
which blew out the bulkheads e ret ted
to keep the fire from spreading. The
men were suffocated by smoke and
steam. Had the accident happened fif
teen minutes sooner 100 men would
have been caught. Fifteen minutes
later the new shift would have been at
work.
The explosion caused the mine to
cave from the surface, and the rails of
the railroad, which crosses the prop
erty, were fVisted in every conceivable
shape. The mine company has had
trouble with fire for years and had
-ucted a cement bulkhead, which
it was thought would keen it under
control for years. This was destroyed.
The dead:
T. W. CROFUT.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1905,
BOLD HIGHWAYMAN ARRESTED WHILE
ROBBING A SALOONKEEPER
Warning Is Given to Policeman
A lone highwayman made a bold at
tempt to hold up Arthur Hewett. bar
tender of the Cafe Nome Saloon, 525
Pacific street, about 3 o'clock yesterday
afternoon. The scene of the crime was
the t'afe Nome. The only person pres
ent besides the highwayman and his
intended quarry was Morris Learney,
, who is employed in a fruit store at 111
Clement street. He ran out and called
two policemen, who prevented the crime
and arrested the highwayman.
Shortly after three o'clock a man
about five feet six inches tall walked
in. He stood fronting Hewett, and,
pulling a revolver, he pointed it at
Hewett and said, "Shell out with the
dough." Hewett laughed and told the
little man to go away. "L#ook here,"
said the robber, "I mean business" as
his finger caressed the trigger in a sig
nificant manner. Hewett turned pale
and pulled otii the cash drawer.
' Learney had been in a side room and
he ran out of the saloon and notified
Policemen R. G. Skain and A. E.
Holmes of the hold-up. They were
only a few feet away and when they
rushed into the saloon Hewett had a
handful of coin in his hand, which he
was going to turn over to the robber.
Skain and Holmes grabbed the rouber,
who swung the muzzle of the revolver
toward Skaln"s abdomen. Before he
could fire Skain placed his forefinger
against the trigger and after a scuffle
he and Holmes succeeded in wresting
the revolver from the fiend.
At the city prison the robber was
impudent and refused to give his name.
A bank book of the Union Bank of
Kedlands with the name "Joseph Mil
ler" was taken from his pocket and he
admitted that it was his name. It
â bowed a deposit of $195 on March 18
last and a subsequent withdrawal of
$113. He was booked on a charge of
attempt to commit robbery. All the
coin he had was 75 cents. The revol
ver was loaded in every chamber. A,
box of cartridges was found in his
pocket.
Miller said he came from Reri'.ands
about two weeks ago to set work as a
cook, but further than that he refused
to say anything about himself or why
he made an attempt to hold up the
bartend/r. He had evidently been
drinking, and while in prison asked for
a flask of whisky, as he said he needed
it badly. The police think he isÂ» an old
crook. He gives his age as 33 years
but looks older.

SAFE CRACKER
IS IDENTIFIED
TACOMA. April 2.â Detective Ryan
of San Francisco to-day visited the
County Jail and recognized John De
laney as "Babe" Curtin, a diamond
thief and safe-blower and one of the
most notorious crooks in the West.
Curtin is now serving one month in the
County Jail for petty larceny. Ryan
will take him to San Francisco to face
a trial on a robbery charge.
"Three-fingered" Franklin, Curtin's
"pal," has been already convicted of
complicity In the crime. Together they
are believed to have robbed the safe of
Grocer William Schroeder in San Fran
cisco. They made their escape after
shooting Policeman Maloney. Curtin, it
is said, fired the shot.
After jumping his bail of $4000 and
being arrested in Tacoma, Curtin
bragged of his exploits to fellow pris
oners. One of them told the police of
Curtin's boasts. Detective Ryan says
that at least twenty safe-cracking jobs
are charged to Curtin in San Francisco
alone.

PUTS HIMSELF
IN TRAIN'S PATH
SAN JOSE, April 2.â A man aged
about 32 years, supposed to be Arthur
Tilcock. a medical student of the San
Francisco Polyclinie, deliberately laid
his head upon the railroad track near
Sunnyvale this morning and it was al
most severed from his body by a north
bound train. The unfortunate man was
not killed outright, but lived until he
was taken to Mountain View.
In the baggage-room at Mountain
View, near where the injured man was
laid, was found a card on which was
printed the name Arthur Tllcock and
the address of Dr. Bassett's clinic, 430
Ellis street. The card gives the address
of Tilcock as the St. Nicholas Hotel.
The St. Nicholas Hotel people declare
that no one bearing the name Tllcock
lived there within the last three months.

clinic say that while Tilcock may have
been a student there, they know noth
ing of him.

wounded his wife at her temporary
home here shortly after midnight
Saturday. Four times he pulled the
trigger and two of the shots took ef
fect, one in the abdomen, the other

tempt the first act, but lacked the
nerve to commit the second. Physi

Fisher's refusal to live with h*er hus

BRIAN PAVING
WAY FOR 1908
Nebrtskan Urges the Organi
zation of Democratic Clubs
Throughout the Country
RADICALS TO CONTROL
Bank and File of Party,
He Says, Are Weary of
Conservative Leadership
LINCOLN, Nebr.. April 2. â It is a
getting together of the aggressive ele
ments of the party in active prelimi
nary work for the great battle of
1905," is the way W. J. Bryan ex
plained his recent activity in connec
tion with the reorganisation of the
Democratic party. Bryan returned to
day from Dcs Moines and it was with
particular reference to the meeting
held there last night, at which he made
the principal address, that he spoke.
Bryan explained that the Dcs Moines
meeting, like the one held in TopÂ«ha,
Kate., late in February, was to fur
ther a movement for the organization
of Democratic clubs and thereby place
the machinery of the party in the
hands of those who meant it well. In
lowa, he said, the same plan had been
adopted as in Kansas, with both of
which he was in hearty sympathy.
Bryan continued:'
R organization is hardly the proper way ' to
express it. â  because t."e party does not need
reorganization. There .is no factional divi
sion calling (<-? separate efforts, but the move
ment . Is to get back, to the people.- to put the
radical and progressive element in more com
plete control, that therÂ» be united, harmonious
effoit for the campaign of 1008. The purpose
is to gin at the bottom, letting the rank and
fll* have a voice in the national convention by
writing the platform at home for the national
convention to ratify.
Bryan ./said he was not trying to
head a faction or to change the or
ganization, except that he wanted the
progressive men of the party to take
the lead. â¢ The conservatives, he said,
had dominated the last national , con
vention and. the party had met with
defeat. He believed the rank and file
of the voters was for progression and
radicalism, if need be. Bryan con
tinued: - .v. v
The work should begin' at the primaries
and every Democrat should vote. It remains
with the rank and tile â of thÂ» ' Democratic
party to say what the party's course shall be.
No cnt will for a moment doubt the course
which will be adopted by the - rank and file
If they avail themselves of the duty to register
th-Mr preference at the primaries. But a sys
tematic effort win be necessary in order that
Democia.ts will be ::nDreased with the Im
portance of participating in their party's coun
cils. The enemies of good government, the
beneficiaries .of class legislation. ? act as onÂ«
man wit* unlimited means at their disposal.
The people, have .only their votes, and they
must tast them together or suffer defeat.
Democrats who believe their party should be a
party of iiÂ» people have it in their power,
through systematic organization, to -so shape
their party's policies and govern its environ
ment for the 19CS campaign that It will com
mand the support of all men who have grown
weary .of the exactions . made by special in
terests. MflÃttÂ£Â£SÃ3SfiE
Bryan presided to-night at the
meeting in St. Paul's Methodist Epis
c-oj>al Church and introduced Balling
ton Booth, who made an address in be
half of the Volunteers of America.
NOVEL TURNS
ARE SEEN AT
THE ORPHEUM
The change of bill at the Orpheum
last night produced several winners for
the appreciation of the throngs that
visit the popular O'Farrell-street play
house. They include singing and danc
ing acts, a short sketch and a novel
exposition of the wonders of liquid air.
George C. Boniface Jr., a clever
ccmedian, assisted by Bertha Walzinger
and Merle McGill, produced a catchy
'"one-timer" entitled "Two Aches and
One Pain." Don Francisco de Souza
was in fine voice last nigh* and began
his second week after appearing only
two evenings of last week:
Cooper and Robinson, colored come
dians, are one of the hits of the even
ing in several novel topical songs and
accompanying buck and wins dances.
They compare favorably with Murphy
and Francis in their line of work.
Knight Brothers and Miss Sawtelle in
a twentieth century dancing act were
also clever.
Tne wonders of liquid air were ex
ploited by Professor D. Rugg of Lon
don, who froze candle flames, boiled
ice, and melted bessemer steel before
the astonished audience. The demon
stration was unique, and its accom
panying scientific explanations educa
tional. The moving pictures, present
ing winter sports, were heartily ap
plauded. The holdover turns are Will

Campus.
Nature Study of
Keith Slowly
Dying
BERKELEY. April Iâ Ground Su
perintendent Brrlton of the university
has found that in Wildcat Canyon the
oak trees have been attacked by a cat
erpillar plague, so that on all sides evi
dences of their ravages are visible. The
appetite of the pest in insatiable, and
when once fairly in action the caterpil
lars make an end of leaves and twigs
and all th*> tender or edible parts of
tht* oak trep*. leaving them in a condi
tion that presages complete destruc
tion.
The aitl of the university botanists isÂ»
invoked in dealing with this
swarm of caterpillars, and their expert
knowledge will be utilized in applying
measures which it is hoped will not
only wipe out the present crop of cater
pillars, but render the trees immune
fmm future visitations.
After the discovery of the caterpil
lars' ravages in Wildcat Canyon, a
dose search for the insects all over the
grounds was made, and it was found
that the advance guard of the army of
pillars had spread to the westerly
part of the campus, some of the invad
ing force having reached the famous
Le <'onte oak, a tree where memorial
exercises in honor of the dead profes
sur are held yearly, and beneath which
tablet marking the tree as the
Le Conte oak. The old tree has been
painted by William Keith, the land
scape artist, and is daily an object of
interest and veneration to visitors at
the university and strangers within the
college grounds. The possibility of its
destruction has excited the college
ground keepers and the authorities as
well, and no effort will be spared to
make it certain that the great old tree
|aj rendered immune from the caterpil
lar JM?5t.

TENNIS GAMES
PROVE EXCITING
Handicap Doubles Tourna
ment on the Park Courts
Interest Many Spectators
The handicap doubles tennis tourna
ment played on the Golden Gate Park
courts yesterday furnished some close
and interesting matches, which were
witnessed by many spectators. As a
rule, the handicapping was good and
one-sided matches were not as numer
ous as usual. Two teams qualilied for
the semi-finals. They are Harold Ga
briel and Mariua Hotchkiss and E. P.
Flnnegan and J. R. Lewis.
By far the closest match of the day
was the last one played. The contest
ants were Harold Gabriel and Marius
Hotchkiss, the clever academic team.
and A. H. Brabant and Robert Drolla.
The teams met on even terms and the
score proves the handicapper used ex
cellent judgment. Brabant and Drolla
won the first set handily, but the next
two were exceedingly close. The latter
went to Hotchkiss and Gabriel. The
third set was unusually long. Gabriel
and Hotchkiss led at 4-1 and at 6-5 and
40-0, but were not declared .winners un
til twenty games had been played. The
score was 2-6, 7-5, 12-10.
Another match that was almost as
close and furnished better tennis was
that between Carl Gardner and Mfl
ville Long and Charles Foley and
Charles Dunlap. The former received
"owe" odds of 15, which many thought
a too liberal handicap. Foley and Dun
lap, despite the odds, almost won the
match. The score was 6-4, 4-6, 8-6.
The scores follow:
Preliminary round â GaynÂ«ss and Morton
(scratch) beat McDufty and Otis (3-6), 6-2, 6-8,

MANY HOMES ARE BUILT
People From San Francisco
Line of the "Key Route M
Advance Satisfactorily
OAKLAND, April 2.â The announce
ment of the plans of the Key Route
Company for their main line on Twen
ty-second street has caused a jump in
property values in the vicinity of San
Pablo avenue and Twenty-second
street, and in several cases the price
has advanced to $400 a front foot. The
plans of the Key Route include not only
the building of the line along Twenty
second street, but also the establish
ment of general and division offices in
the present headquarters at San Pablo
avenue and Jones street.
The new crosstown line will extend
along Twenty-second street from
Broadway west and will connect with
all the main lines of the Oakland
Transit Company. Stations will be
erected at Broadway, Telegraph ave
nue, San Pablo avenue and Market
street. In order to secure a direct right
of way through to Broadway the Key
Route Company has purchased from
Charles Jurgens the property on Broad
way, which faces Twenty-second street,
which ends at Telegraph avenue. The
new line will run directly through this
property to Broadway.
Another transaction which has re
sulted directly from the plans for the
new line is the sale of a lot on San
Pablo avenue, near Twenty-second
street, to D. J. Hall by C. H. King. It
is reported that Mr. Hall has bought
more than 3000 feet of property along
the right of way of the new line.
Since it was established the opera
tions of the Key Route have been in
strumental in the development of sev
eral, large tracts of suburban property.
Holcomb, Breed & Bancroft report
about twenty residences recently com
pleted or in course of construction on
Santa Fe tract No. 5, near the Key
Route South Berkeley station, and
about twenty-five attractive cottages,
colonial style houses and fiats on Santa
Fe tracts Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 7, located
close to the Fifty-fifth street station
of the Berkeley Key Routa line, now in
operation, and also close to the Fifty
fifth street branch Key Route line, now
being built.
Among San Francisco builders on
these Santa Fe tracts are the follow
ing:
(j H. Howard and A. C. MacParlane of San
Francisco, on Fifty-first strpet. near Dover;
Q. R. Blower of Neville & Co., San Franc-leco,

PELICAN BACKS
CAPTAIN NANCE
Satirical Journal Advises
Students to Take Their
Mi 1 itary Work Seriously
EDITORIAL IS STRONG
Praises .the Instructor and
Declares That the Drill
Is Part of the Course
BERKELEY. April 2.â "His place
here is to teach us how to drill." so
says the Pelican, the satirical quarterly
of the Berkeley students, speaklner Of
Captain Nance, military instructor*
The Pelican has cartooned and lam
pooned the West Pointer who insist* <1
on strict military discipline during drill
hours at Berkeley, but to-day publishes
an editorial advising the students to
take their military course seriously.
When Captain Nance first introduced
his ideas, which were regarded as sav
wring of the martinet, the students re
belled. Their Insubordination created
quite a furor in the college town. But
they finally discovered that while the
captain insisted upon discipline, he
meant it for their best interests. Grad
ually most of the students fell in line
with the idea that the course in mili
tary science was part of their work.
Now even the satirists realize it. The
Pelican's editorial is as follows:
Pelican thinks it is time to drop a word
of advice to the fellowa who are supposed
to drill. It is time for them to get onto
themselves â not all of thÂ«m, but those who in
sist on rough housing during the drill hour.
If the men who create disturbances such as
that of last Monday don't get down to re
spectable work of their own accord, it ia up
to those drilling aÂ» they should to make the
disturbing element do its share properly.
The work la there to be done. The uni
versity prescribes it, just as It prescribes a
certain amount of work In mathematics or
natural science. We realize that the. other
I>r>-Â«(.ribed work must be done, and we do it
aÂ« well as we can. Military, in the eyes of
those who graduate some of vÂ«, stands in
exactly the same, category Â»â Â» mathematics or
natural science, and it is for ue to do all
prescribed work with sincere vigor out of re
spect for the university regulations. If any
of us fail to res>pect the university regula
tions, then get out.
Thfre are quite a few at California who
dr> respect university regulations. They want
to do what is assigned them, and they put their
best into the effort. By rough housing during
drill, it is made harder for these to accomplish
what they have undertaken. Then out of re
gard for the fellows who respect their alma
mater, those who show by disturbing drill that
they do not give her a though ought to eubstde
a bit.
Finally if we don't care either for the au
thority of the university or the sincerity of
the fellows, we ctrtainly should prove our ap
preciation of the manly way In which Cap
tain Nance has acted. He came here, en
tirely <>ut "of sympathy with our college spirit
and ignorant of what it meant. This led
him to making what many of us thought were
mistakes. He tried to learn our view and
see how we felt. That he did this Is proved
by his later actions. Now hie place here Is
to teach us how to drill. The better he does
this the better does he fill his position; and
It Is our place, out of appreciation for the
man. if for no other reason, to make his po
sition as easy as Doaelble.
O course, the rough house during drill on
Monday wns not criminal. It was only a li%
tle thoughtless. But gft In and try to think.
Pelican gives you exercises In the practice.
If incompetent cadet officers can't make the
thoughtless of us be otherwise, then let the
privates who are working earnestly try a hand
at It. At least, being thoughtful is better
than being thoughtlesa. Good may come from
the one â It never can come from the other.
The current Pelican is called an
"April Fool's number." Its cartoons
are daring, as usual, in many in
stances, and its jokes occasionally
risque. The contribution of one out
sider, dealing with Ben Greet and his
frequent appearances at college, was
printed, reading thus:
We've been greeted by Ben
Till of Ben Greet we're sore.
Thank God we'll be greeted
By Ben Greet no more.
The college "water wagon," labeled
"Anheuser," bearing a load of royster
ing students wearing the university
"C," has a full page cartoon. A play
upon the Saturday Evening Post is
made in a cartoon depicting a collegian
with battered plug affectionately em
bracing, in his maudlin enthusiasm, an
unresponsive lamp post, all supposedly
occurlng on a Saturday night.
Recorder James Button, in knicker
bockers, hidden behind a fence, has the
role of a small boy trying to fool the
oncoming pedestrian with a package
labeled "diploma," to which a string is
attached.
Gibes are cast at the earnest and ris
ing young journalists who toil for the
Daily Californian without money and
without price, Ihe gibes taking this
form:
How doth the freshman busily
Improve each shining hour?
He hlketh after items for
TVie Daily Cauliflower.
He hustles till it makes him thin,
He weareth out his shoes;
And In the end he brinjjeth In
A bunch of last week's news.

Cannot Get ITxtra Pay.
City Attorney Long has advised the
Election Commission that deputy
registrars are not entitled to extra pay
for additional services rendered out
side of regular office hours. During
election time the deputies are often
compelled to work from 5 to 11
6'olodt in the evening. Long says that
a deputy should not be. required to
work beyond the hours set forth in
the charter, which are from 8:30 a.
m. to 5 p. m., but in the event he so
serves, compensation for said services
must be regarded as included in his
monthly salary.

"Sewing me up just like a sack,"
remarked Henry St. Clair. an eight
year-old boy, at the Central Emergency
Hospital. Dr. Wilson had to put nine
stitches in the little follows head. He
had fallen from the second story of a
building near Polk street and Ash ave
nue, sustaining some painful lacera
tions. The little fellow never wlnceU
during the painful operation. He even
smiled, and when, the doctor had fin
ished he inquired if there were any
more stitches needed, remarkinn that
it was a funny thing to be sewed up
like a sack.

That Is to Close Them
ALL BEE! Ql ITO KAOEU
Condition of Affairs Deepens
Puzzle Regarding Disposal
'of the Corruption Fund
The Grand Jury will honor thÂ« pool
rooms with the largest part of its at
tentions tins week, ii indication- are
not misleading. The sellers of - tha
slips that investors toadly believe will
be the foundation of their fortunes are
not unmindful of the honor to be con
ferred upon them, and a great lull in
the placing of bets Is noticeable. Men
commissioned to gather evidence have
been hard at work for some days
though, and the members of the in
quisitorial body expect to have sunu*
important material to work with when
they get down to the real labor of in
vestigating the poolsellers.
One of the most important questions
before the Grand Jury is who receive*!
the money it ia declared waa con
tributed by the poolseilera and others
to put a bandage over the eyea of the
law? While no names axÂ« given, it ia
apparent into whose hands money so
raised would be placed to purob&a*
that for which it waa intended, and
therefore it is pretty apparent toward
whom the Grand Jury is reaching ia
its strivings to land those who cays
the protection.
As in the case of Chung, the China
man accused of passing out the bribe
money to Sergeant Kills, indictments
over this alleged corruption fund will
be difficult, as there is no corroborative
evidence, all those who know the facts
being parties to the collections and re
ceipts.
The disclosures on this subject as
far as they go, however, have made
some people nervous, and they ars
wondering just how much the Grand
Jury knows about the collection and
payment of the money and how much
information will be carried to that
body, now that the matter haa been
opened up. There are many citizens
who 'remember things" when a cru
sade is commenced, and their con
science troubles them until they unloa 1
what they know where it will do the
most purifying. Facts from sources <>t
this sort are likely to get into the
Grand Jury room, to the danger I
some who have felt themselves saf>\
In fact, it looks like more voluntary
testimony was coming forward each
day. some of it valuable. â¢
weak, for new tales >>f corruption seem
to come into possession of the Grand
Jury constantly. How many citizens
wh<> know things are lying around
with their consciences troubling them
is a question quite interesting lust now
to a number of office holders, who have
not let any alfalfa *o unmowed while
they have been serving the public.
Another thing that is bothersome to
officials and others who have been on
easy street is that the present Grand
Jury doesn't seem to lose enthusiasm.
The ennui that is usually expected to
develop in such bodies risht after thÂ«
first burst of glory seems to be de
layed in this ca9e. The Jurors ap
parently get more interested the fur
ther they go, and then they have
started on so many propositions that
have hung more or. less prominently
before the public eyÂ« that they cannot
well stop until they have accomplished
something to show that what has Â«onÂ«
before is not all smoke.
It Is admitted by members of thÂ«
Jury that the hope of proving that
Works Commissioner Maestretti was

PARROT RANCH
NETS FORTUNE
American Raises the Birds
in 3fexico and Skillfully
Teaches Them to Converse
HAS SEVERAL THOUSAND
Devises a System by Which
His Many Pets Are Able
to Instruct One Another
Special Plscatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, Mexico, April 2. â Mar
tin Holts, an American, who establish
ed a parrot ranch near Victoria a few
years ago, has met with wonderful suc
cess and has accumulated a fortune
In the business. It is probably the only
parrot ranch in the world; it is cer
tainly the only one in Mexico.
Holts was employed for several
years as a passenger conductor on the
old Monterey and, Mexican Gulf Rail
road, now a part of the Mexican Cen
tral system. His division was between
Victoria and the port of Tampico, on
the Gulf coast, through the heart of
the parrot country. He was always
interested in the bright colored birds,
and while running as conductor he
collected many of them and taught
them to talk English. There were
many tourists traveling up and down
his line and he dnl a sood side busi
ness by selling the birds to Americans
and others.
The thought then occurred to Holts
that he might make more money by
retiring from railroad work and de
voting his time to raising parrots. He
followed this plan and purchased a
large tract of forest land near Vic
toria which was teeming with wild
iarrote. He fitted up the ranch in a
unique way. Wire netting was placed
around and over the trees and the
birds were confined therein. He has
had the greatest success in raising the
birds.
It is in teaching the parrots to talk
that Holts has had his most unique
success. He is a linguist, speaking
English, Spanish, French and German
fluently. He divided his flock of sev
eral thousand birds into four classes
â one for each language. He then
took a few birds from each class *nd
set to work to teach them to talk? At
the end of a few months Holts had
taught a number of birds English,
Spanish, German and French and the
educated birds were placed in their
respective sections. It was Holts'
theory that by doing this the educated
birds would teach their companions to
talk. His hopes were realized to the
fullest extent. He says that at the
end of the first year he had several
hundred educated parrots.
Holts believes that the standard of
intelligence of parrots can be greatly
increased by proper attention to
breeding them. In his collection of
parrots, which now number several
/housand, he ha? several which are
seemingly possessed of reasoning pow
ers. These educated birds have been
tanght to carry on a conversation
with earh other. This conversation, in
which each bird knows its part
thoroughly, covers nearly thirty min
utes of time.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANTIOCH. April 2. â One man lost
his life and another was badly injured
in the Santa Fe yards here to-day.
William Hewitt, a laborer, and
Charles A. Sweeney were walking be
tween the rails of the Lumber and
Distillery Company's spur track in
the east end of the railroad yards. A
freight train ran to the extreme end
of the yard to spot an oil car for the
Distillery Company. The car was
coupled to the front of the engine.
While it was being shoved down the
spur at an ordinary rate of speed sev
eral warning signals were given, but
the men paid no attention to them.
Before the car could be stooped it
struck Hewitt, killing him instantly.
The brakeman managed to save the
life of Sweeney by reaching out ahead
of the car and throwing him off the
track.
Sweeney lost a finger and was badly
bruised. He has a wife and two
children. His injuries are not con
sidered serious. Hewitt waa single.
He resided on an ark near the rail
road yards.

Guides Say Their Distin

6pecial Dispatch to The Call.
GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colo..
April 2. â President Roosevelt is plan
ning to eclipse his. previous reputation
for daring and will try to kill every
bear he gets in Colorado on his com
ing trip with a hunting knife, instead
of a rifle. He will fight the most
ferocious and vicious silvertip bears
at close quarcers, instead of standing
off and permitting the dogs to be
slaughtered and disemboweled and
trusting to a quick shot with a dum
dum bullet.
While the story has not been gen
erally credited, it is a fact that dur
ing President Roosevelt's trip, under
the guidance of John Goff, he stab
bed to death nearly every mountain
lion the pair got and he afterward
said the sport waa the most exciting
he had ever had and the danger â
well, the stock of his rifle showed
several deep gashes where the teeth
of a lion had snapped and that they
had not caught the Roosevelt leg was
due to a very slight margin.
FOOLHARDY PASTIME.
Compared with fighting a mountain
lion with a bowie knife, the same tac
tics with an immense silvertip bear
seem foolhardy. The cat-like instinct
of the lion actually makes the danger
reasonably slight, for the lion will al
ways abandon the man for a dog and
Mr. Roosevelt took advantage of this
to rush in. deliver the death blow and
jump back while the dogs were ha
rassing the lion. , While the risk was
very great, thera was not much
chance that the big cat would de
liberately ignore the dogs and set upon
the man.
Despite the peril. President Roose
velt has notified his guides that he
wants to kill as many bears as pos
sible with the knife he used three or
four years ago on the lions, and
Guides Goff and Borah have promised
that he shall be given plenty of op
portunity.
WILL BEGIN TRIP TO-DAY.
WASHINGTON*. April 2. â President
Roosevelt will leave Washington to
morrow morning on a long trip to the
West and Southwest. He will be ab
sent from the capital nearly two
months. One of the chief objects of
the trip which the President has had
in mind Is the reunion of his Rough
Rider Regiment of the Spanish-
American war, which is to take place
at San Antonio. Tex., next Friday, and
for which an elaborate programme of
exercises has been arranged. There
will be a number of brief stops en
route, where the President will make
addresses.
Leaving San Antonio, there will be a
brief stop and address at Fort Worth,
which will terminate the public part of
the trip, following which the President
is to go hunting irk. the Panhandle of
Texas and later in Colorado. All ar
rangements have been made whereby
tho President will keep in touch with
public affairs, both during his railroad
ride and while hunting, so that he will
be enabled to pass on all matters re
quiring his attention.
KENTUCKY'S WELCOME.
LOUISVILLE. Ky., April 2.âLouis
ville's welcome to President Roosevelt
Tuesday will be a civilian affair. The
local committee decided that, owing to
the short time the executive will be in
the city, it would be better to make his
short stay not only a typical Kentucky
welcome, but a reception representative
of both North and South in a State, bor
dering, as it does, both sections of the
country. Those who will entertain the
President during his three hours' stay
in the city will be composed of repre
sentative citizens of Louisville â men of
tho North and men of the Southâ and
a few invited guests of the State at
large.
Before the President takes his depar
ture he will be presented with three
gifts intended as souvenirs of his visit.
One is a silver flagon filled with water
from the spring on the farm in Larue
County on which Abraham Lincoln was
born. Another is a large silver vase.
The third gift is an inkstand, made
from an oak tree which grew near the
spring on the old Lincoln homestead.
The inkholder is of silver sunk into the
wood. ..

MONDAY APRIL. 3, 1905
BRILLIANT SHOWING OF THE FIRST TRADE QUARTER.
THE first quarter of 1905 is over and its exhibit is much better
than that of the corresponding quarter in 1904, both here ami
in other parts of the country. At this time last year trade was
losing ground everywhere : now it is gaining. Those sanguine
financiers, merchants and manufacturers who planned new commit
ments of their capital at the beginning of the year, feeling confident
another year of prosperity, are having their optimistic expecta-
tions realized.
Here in San Francisco the bank clearings, which were steadily j
falling behind last year, show a gain for the first quarter of about j
$50,000,000, which is a fine showing, and when the returns from the 1
other cities of the country come in they will probably make an j
equally brilliant exhibit. The country's clearings last week were ;
large, being $2,734,996,000, an increase of 52.2 per cent over last
year, with individual gains of 76.8 per cent at New York, 29.5 at
Boston, 29.9 at Philadelphia, 21.2 at Pittsburg, 30.6 at Minneapolis, i
and so on. There is no room for the. croaker before these figures. J
They show good times. . j
Supplementary to this fine exhibit of the clearings is the im- ;
proving conditions in railroad traffic, the earnings of the first three ;
weeks of March showing a gain of 8.2 per cent over last year, with j
the railroads complaining of freight congestion, owing to the heavy :
shipments of spring merchandise. The record of failures, however, is j
not as favorable, those for the week being 244. against 208. last year. j
The crop prospects are brilliant everywhere, and the harvest of the j
whole country this year bids fair to be immense. This condition is
"in itself sufficient to inspire widespread confidence throughout the ;
country.
Bradstreet's has compiled the statistics of edificial and railroad j
construction and equipment for the quarter just closed. They cover j
. 108 cities and towns and show an expenditure for houses, offices, fac- [
lories and other edifices of $455,000,000 during the present calendar
year. Allowances for cities not yet reported would indicate that the
total expenditures for edifices* this year would run well up to
.000.000. In addition to this, marked activity in railroad build
ing and heavy orders for equipment foreshadow an expenditure of .
probably $200,000,000 by the railroads, this all pointing to an aggre- ,
gate expenditure for material and labor of close to*S8oo,ooO",odo. -
The list of improving conditions might be expanded, but the
foregoing points are sufficient to show the brilliant condition of trade
everywhere. As far as determinate at present the country was
never in better financial and commercial condition. V
Money turned firmer in New York during the latter part of the ;
week, call loans rising from about 313 1 _> to 4}- per cent on Friday.
This was expected, however, owing to the demands on the market :
for the disbursement of the regular quarterly dividend and interest
obligations falling due April I, but the rise was nowhere near what
had been anticipated. As it was temporary, its very insignificance
still further enhanced the buoyancy and confidence in Wall street.
And in this connection a bit of current financial history will not be
amiss. ' .
During the week preceding the April 1 settlements rumors of
peace between Russia and Japan suddenly became current all over
Europe and America. They were not only general in Berlin, Paris.
London and New York, but were specific. It % was broadly asserted ,
that peace preliminaries were being seriously considered by Russia
and Japan, the French and American Governments being the two '
mediums through which they were being arranged. The news
papers then became busy, and their correspondents in all the above
centers began nosing around after the facts in the case, but none
could be found. Every Government official in every capital stated
that he knew nothing of any peace preliminaries. If there were any
under way it was news to him. etc. Everybody, was as mum as an
oyster. But the rumors would not down. They kept popping up on
all sides. The mystery increased. Added to them was a report that
the Czar had attempted suicide.
A day or two after these peace rumors were sprung there came
a sly tip and a wink from the inner circles of Wall street that all
these reports of peace were circulated by the leaders of "high finance"
for the dual object of sustaining the world's money market pending
the Paris settlement of April 1 and the flotation of the $150,000,000
Japanese loan, and that there was positively no other basis for them.
This tip was repeated on the following day. but nobody paid any
attention to it. Everybody accepted the peace talk and would have
it no other way. Very good. The Japanese loan was floated with
great eclat and heavily oversubscribed everywhere. The money
markets stood up like a stanch yacht under a stiff breeze. But not
forty-eight hours after the successful flotation of the loan and all
April settlements were assured mouths previously closed like clams
suddenly opened. The Japanese diplomats came out openly and
stated without reserve that Japan was positively not considering any
tee terms, but would continue to pursue the retreating Russians
to a finish. The Russians announced that they would follow the j
war to the bitter end. j
It was a great financial coup. Furthermore, it was a great finan
cial joke. There must have been many a broad smile in many a
financial office over the prettiness of the whole affair. It was 1
â¢hing. however, all around. It hurt nobody and kept things on
â  stable basis. But it shows how easy it is to fool not only a com
munity but the whole world.
- a matter of fact, however, it was all unnecessary. The sup
ply of cash, both here and in Europe, is So vast and accessible that
many other loans and settlements could have been made without
a resort to the circulation of political roorbacks.
THE MOSQUITO MUST GO.
CIVILIZATION i- at war with a winged insect. The revela
tions of science indict the mosquito with high crimes and mis
demeanors against the health of man. It needed no scientific
investigation to impeach the singing little wretch as a destroyer of
comfort, a foe of pleasure and the destroyer of the summer's peace
Sought for in the annual vacation. In this latter capacity the mos
quito has been endured because rebellion against the small blood
sucker seemed useless: We have been content to frighten him away
with a smudge and in extreme cases have even gone to the extent of
smearing with the fat side of bacon rind to keep him off. but now
thai it is known positively that this insect is guilty of taking our
blood and inoculating us at the same time with yellow fever and
malaria active resistance is in order.
Anti-mosquito associations are forming everywhere. Stagnant
pools are being drained, and coal oil is being poured upon the waters
troubled by wigglers. Little fish that relish mosquito eggs are be
ing enlisted in the war. and sulphate of copper is in use as a de
structive agent. The mosquito must go. People resort to the
mountains in the good old summer time, drink the purest of water,
eat the purest of food, and breathe the purest of air, and come home
shaking with malaria, with teeth chattering like castanets and faces
blotched like smallpox in eruption from mosquito bites. The in
fernal things are even suspected of squirting typhoid into us with
their hypodermic syringe, and their character is so bad that they are
open to any suspicion. Formerly people could flee to Hawaii, where
snakes and mosquitoes were unknown. The snake has never broken
into that Eden, but a wind-jamming whaler carried wigglers there in
ater casks and now the blood-eating nightingale is there the
enemy of repose.
The California State Board of Health stands ready to help any
community that will organize to fight the pest, and will send
experts who know every place where this little winged lion has his
lair. Let the good work go on till the last mosquito is smothered in
oil, poisoned with copperas or swallowed by a minnow

FEMININE TARGET, WITH NERVES OF IRON,
CALMLY FACES A WONDERFUL MARKSMAN, WHO
LITERALLY SHOOTS DRESS OFF HER BACK
R SUCCESSOR to William Tell
has at last been found. Colonel
Bordeverry occupies that proud
position; but instead of utilizing
the old-fashioned, out-of-date bow and
arrow or crossbow, a rifle serves his
purposes.
True. Colonel Bordeverry does not
shoot an apple from off the top of a
boy's head. He, however, performs
feats still more marvelous, and at the
Lyceum when he commenced his first
visit to London with his astounding
new turn the audience was held liter
ally spellbound by his daring feats
with rifle and revolver, says the Lon
don Mail.
One of his most wonderful perform
ances is to literally shoot a . lady's
dress off. As seen in our illustration,
in' the lady assistant's hat, on her
shoulders and elbows are various small
targets, the "bull" of which is scarcely
the size of a three-penny bit. How
ever, it is quite large enough for Col
onel Bordeverry's purpose. Rifle in
hand, he stands at one end of the
stage, while his intrepid assistant takes
up her stand at the other. In a trice
the champion rifle and revolver shot
of the world raises his weapon â there
is a sharp report and the lady's hat is
seen to fall to the ground. The bullet
has penetrated the small bullseye,
REIGN OF BIRDS WHEN MAN IS EXTINCT.

forth with the assertion that man
Is destined to become extinct in the
near future â and the near future to
science is but a matter of a few million
years â and that in the ages to come
the world will be dominated by birds.
Professor Samuel W. Williston, pa
leontologist of Chicago University, is
the mouthpiece of science in this case.

continues until the lady's dress is
literally "shot off her back" and she
etands unharmed and calm, garbed In
loose, hanging robes.
That such precis* marksmanship is
truly marvelous gp^s without saying,
.uicl it demands steady nerves from
both the "shooter" and his human
target.
On one occasion in Germany a gen
tleman in the audience protested that
the "colonel's" featfl wort.' not genuine.

was the quiet reply. "I see you are

shot, as the dubious member advanced
toward the footlights. "Yes. and why
not?" came the answer. "Oh, well, nev
er mind." replied Bordeverry; "I'll put
it out for you, as it's against the rules
this side of the footlights." Hardly
had he spoken than a shot was heard,
and the erstwhile smoker found his
cigarette flying out of his mouth. It
had been shot in two narts at a dis
tance of over twelve yards.
Another marvelous feat the famous
marksman performs is to shoot a piece

GRAPE FRUIT â Subscriber. City.
| Grape fruit should be prepared for the
table in the following manner: Cut the
I fruit across, remove the pith In the
position an ordinary piece of lump
sugar. At a distance of seven yards
the colonel raises his rifle, and, seem
ing "scarcely to take aim, shoots the
sugar away from its human supports.
The rapidity with which his feats are
performed has justly earned for this
marvelous marksman the title of the
"world's greatest rifle and revolver
shot."
It seems as easy to him to lean over
backward from the dress circle of a
theater and snuff out a row of candles,
one by one, with a rifle as it is for the
ordinary "shot" to hit a three-foot far
get at a distance of three yards.
It should also be mentioned that the
colonel is an expert piano player. He,
however, scorns to play the piano with
his fingersâ that is far too easy. He
has another and much more original
way of making musicâ he shoots the
"Cavalleria Rusticana" from the piano

makes a target of an ordinary piano.

USE MODERATION
IN LOVEMAKING
Man Who Loses His Head With His Heart Pretty

DOROTHY FENIMORE
THK following complex subject
has been presented to me for
discussion: How far should a
young man cultivate the atti
tude of indifference toward the fair
sex? Should moderation in love be his
aim? Is not great love incompatible
with absolute self-control; and. finally,
would undemonstrative affection sat
isfy a woman?
I cannot begin better than by quot
ing Laurence Sterne's opinion that
"courtship consists in a number of
quiet attentions, not so pointed as to
alarm, nor so vague as to be misun
derstood."
A genial attitude of indifference, I
believe, is both high art and practical
method when you are trying to catch
the fancy of the girl whom you would
seriously woo. Tfius she is not star

might be by undue ardor on your part.
She is the more likely to accept the

all of the animal kingdoms have dom

this basis it is not an impossible pre

POSTTT3I CEREAL.
JOHTV SAYS
"More of the ?\ew Coffee, Please."
A lady from the "Land of the Sky"
in N. C says:
"This winter while on a visit farther
down South, where everybody seems to
be a slave to coffee, I one day found my
hostess prone on her couch. "So giddy,
and oh! how my head aches!' 'Coffee,'
I said warningJy. She supposed so. and
â¢what else could she drink? 'Why, Post-
um,' I replied. 'But that is so insipid
and John does not like it. He calls it
dish water." I thought of the kind of
PoÃtum the darkey cook had served,
and asked if I might make her a cup. j
So into the kitchen I went and made j
Postum as we have it at horne â rich,
< !ear and fragrant, after good, long
boiling to bring out the flavor.
"'I brought it to her in one of the
daintiest cups and she drank it under
protest, declaring it might make her 1
head worse. She exclaimed, 'Why, how j
nice this is. Tou don't mean this is j
Postum?"' I told her the difference was '
only in the making. She had had it j
before boiled only a few minutes, and j
now she had it made according to di- j
rectJons that are plain enough on each :
package.
â¢'In about an hour's time she sat up I
and. laughing a little, said her head felt I
nearly ell and the giddiness was al- j
;r.ost gone. â¢ . !
"The next morning we had Postum;
Â« made right) for breakfast. We told !
John It was a new coffee we wanted j
him to try He called for a second cup j
and the next morning called for some
more cf that new coffee. . |
"Quite a while after we had been j
rervlng it regularly John spoke of feel- .
ing co much better. He had gotten over '
l.is nervousness, and only then did we (
tare tell him he had been steadily {
- I? ing the despised Pcstum. , \
"Before I left off coffee my complex- i
bn was bad and sometimes my temper !
Horse. The complexion has cleared up '
In a most remarkable way. I had bet- j
ter refer to the other members of the
family for a testimonial as to a change 'â 
in temper, leastwise we all abandoned*
coffee about two years ago, for it af- !
f ected us more .like liquor,* and every !
:neniber of my family showed the eft** t '
of it in nervous, trembling sensations, [
occasional dizzy spells, and more or
kss liver complaint. AH of these. symp- j
urns have disappeared since we made J
the change to >, Postum." Name j given !

FROM BUMPKIN
TO CITY DANDY
Sideliirlits T'pon the Gaareer
of James Hazen Hyde
of the Equitable Society
6pÂ«cial Dispatch to Tbs CalL
NEW YORK. April 2.â At the confer
ence yesterday between the warring
factions of the Equitable Life Assur
ance Society a compromise was effected.
The mutualization plan was agreed to,
the change to take place in two instead
of four years.
Vice President James H. Hazen
Hyde, the center of the furor within
the society, drove to the place of con
ference in a stylish turnout, with great
bunches of violets decorating the head
stalls of his horses' bridles.
In connection with the present con
troversy some interesting facts regard
ing Hyde have been gleaned by ,the
local press. He was known as "Caleb"
Hyde at Harvard in his early college
life, because of his rural bearing.
Hyde was in appearance a country
bumpkin when he started college life,
but once started in the metropolitan
swim his metamorphosis was sudden
and astounding.
In college he was an ardent student
of the French language, customs and
manners, and with free rein and plenty
of money to indulge hla tastes he very
soon became a noted character in* New
York City. Hyde is not more than 30
years of age, but his bizarre effects in
dress and personal adornment make
him seem older.
With his Henry 111 beard, his lus
trous brown eyes and his carefully
curled pompadour he is known every
where. He speaks in a low, cultivated
voice that approaches effeminacy and
his accent is known as "continental,"
being neither English nor French and
least of all American.
Despite the extremes to which he
goes in the matter of dress, he is said
by several of the leading tailors of the
city to be the best dressed man in New
York. He lavishes enough on his ward
robe each year to support fifty fam
ilies in moderate circumstances.
Hyde seeks the society of celebrities,
especially foreigners. In this he ob
serves no social distinctions so long
as the fame of the person is world
wide. Hyde likes to give small house
parties at the Oaks and usually these
include two or three women of fash
ion, a famous actress, an opera singer
or a Parisian Journalist. He is fond
of showing his art treasures and he nas
gathered together many in the last five
years.

ter Creek, was attended by the fol
lowing guests, Mrs. W. H. Foster, Mrs.

tis. Miss Sthel Taylor, Miss Alice

Mrs. Celia Carroll was hostess at a
very enjoyable luncheon and theater
party Saturday given in honor of her
daughter, Helen E. Carroll. Covers
were laid for ten in the palm garden
of the Palace. After luncheon the
party spent the remainder ol the
afternoon at the Columbia Theater.
PERSONAL.
Mrs. CorrlUa Banister of Gonzales,
Tex., is in San Francisco. She is the
author of "A Modern Miracle" and
â¢'Self-Building Through Common Sense

SHONTS A MAN
WHO SUCCEEDS
New Chairman of the Pana
ma Canal Commission Is
Absolute Stranger to Fear
HE LOVES A FIGHT
Wipes Up the Floor With
Enemy Who Came to His
Office to Thrash Him
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 2.â The appointment
of Theodore Perry Shonts, president of
the "Clover Leaf" Railroad, to be
chairman of the reorganized Panama
Canal Commission is commended by
Chicago men of affairs who know him
best. They say he is the "right man
for the place," and unite In declaring
that he Is equal to the responsibilities
of the position.
Mark Morton added that Shonts was
a lion-hearted man, "never known to
show the white feather," and. related as
proof of this an anecdote which he said
was characteristic of the fiber of the
man.
"A strapping big fellow, a contractor
who had a grievance against Mr.
Shonts for some fancied wrong, called
at his office here ten years ago, and as
Mr. Shonts was busy had some delay
in getting into the private office. His
greeting was that he had called to get
even with Shonts. Looking up from his
desk, Shonts, without any comment,
simply said:
" 'I am glad you called.'
"Then Shonts sprang to his feet,
locked the door and pulled off his coat
in a jiffy. In three minutes the con
tractor was as anxious to get out of
the room as he had been to get into it.
Chairs were broken and the room
looked as if a typhoon had swept
through it.
"But Shonts was not through with
his man yet. He reminded the con
tractor that the latter had wanted to
see him and that be^lKLs there to be
seen, and crash! smash! bang! some
more. Then Shonts put his head out
of the door, as cool as you please, and
told the office boy to ask the visitor to
depart. He went, and Shonts resumed
work at his desk."

"Supplies of strictly fancy Coast seeded ral*

with an upward tendency. Sales of small

Irregular grades on . th-.- spot here, prices on

little or no Interest In such offerings. In spot
prunes a fair Jobbing business was reported
at the end of last week, the demand being
confined mainly to 40s. SOs and 60s. and most
of the reported sales being made at the insld*

INDIES DEFEAT
ALBION ROVERS
Th<? Independents beat the Albion
Rovers 7 goals to 3 in the semi-final
round for the California association
football union cup yesterday at Free
man's Parfct Golden Gate. The match
was keenly contested throughout and
was watched by a large number of en
thusiastic Bpectators. Arthur Robin
son was referee.
Early in the Srst period Shand, who
anna playing in the Rover back line,
handled the ball within the penalty
area and the referee awarded a penalty
kick, which resulted in a goal for the
Independents. The Rovers quickly ob
tained an equalizing goal and before
the â¢ id of the first period added two
more, so the ore read: Albion
Koverc, 3 goals: Independents. 1 goal.
When the second period opened the
Independents made a goal in less than
twenty seconds from the kick-off, mak
ing the score: Albion Rovers. 3; Inde
pendents, 2. The Rovers seemed to
lose confidence and scored nothing
during the rest of the game, while the
Independents kept on until the record
Ftood: Independents, 7 goals; Rovers,
2 goals. The Rover team included
three new arrivals from Great Britain,
who rendered excellent service â Hill,
Petrie and Michie. The Independents
played one new man. J. Dwyer, who
also proved an acquisition on the right
uing. The teams lined up as folio

FISH HATCHING
AT NATURE SHOW
Alexander Pope* collection of paint
ings have proved a potent attraction
Â«it the forestry, fish and game exhibi
tion In Mechanics' Pavilion. One pic
ture in particular is always surround
ed by a group of admirers. It is a
trill life, showing a paneled door on
which is fixed a pair of fine antlers.
On these antlers are placed a couple
of rifles and small arms and a brace
of dead clucks. This canvas is draped
and lighted so effectively that it ap
pears more like reality than a repro
duction. Mr. Pope, who is a Boston
artist and one of America's fore
most painters of animal life and sport
ing subjects, regards this as the best
work that ever came from his brush.
Of the other paintings that have
been hung by the committee, a three
quarter -male figure in hunting cos
l ume by R. Langtry Partington, en- -
â titled "A Diana of To-day." has re
ceived the lion's share of praise. j
Day after day new greens are added '
I v the decorations and the forest effect I
l>. heightened by the decorators. The j
Â«alt water aquaria are in fine shape for |
exhibition, the water having been fil
tered. New fish are arriving con
stantly. Of the latest additions, mag
nificent specimens of the rainbow and
cutthroat trout were surrounded by ad- j
miring throngs on Saturday night. |

the East, but a game unfamiliar to Cal

marines will give a drill in the !

LACK OF HARES
STOPS COURSING
The supply of hares at Union Cours
ing Park became exhausted yesterday
afternoon when three greyhounds re
mained in the stake. It was found nec
essary to postpone the semi-tinal round
and the deciding course until next Sun
oay. The three dogs still in the stake
st.. Mr. Zlgnego. Richard Anton and
Freeport. The first named brace went
to the slips in the semi-final round and
ran B4i undivided trial, each scoring
three points. This disposed of the last
available hare.
There were several long trials
during the day. Valley Pride and
Fontenoy ran 115 seconds. Freeport
and Polka Dot ran 123 seconds and the
Duke and In Time lzs seconds. Fa
\ .iritis held their own. losing but nine

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY. APRIL 3. 1905.
S IWASHES HANDED DOUBLE DEFEAT
BY UNCLE'S WHIRLWINDS.
WHALEN SNOWBALLS NORTHERNERS ONCE AGAIN
fNCLKS STAR PITCHER. WHO BLANKED THE BIWABHEB Tttli X IX ONE WEKK: A FAST LITTLE OUTFIELDER. WHO
HKLPED THK SKAIS WIN TWO GAMES YESTERDAY. AND THE SEATTLE TWIRLER WHO WON APPLAUSE OF THE
FANS MY HIS GRITTY WORK IN THE BOX.
The winning combination of Uncle's
baseball brigade has not been broken
up yet, and it never will be if Seattle
tarries here awhile. There were two
entertainments yesterdayâ a breakfast
function and a matinee celebration.
Seattle took second money each time,
without making as much as a bid to
wade in and start something. Scores â
Morning game, San Francisco 12, Seat
tle 4; afternoon game, San Francisco 3,
Seattle 0.
Jimmy Whalen has started the sea
son like a champion of champions. He
completed eighteen innings yesterday
afternoon without allowing an opposing
batsman to do the circuit of the paths
on him. It was a legitimate shutout for
Jimmy. His team mates backed up his
efforts without making a blunder, or
anything that resembled one.
Right in the first inning the natives
waded in for a run. Mohler got a walk
and Spencer swung through to right
with a double. Hildebrand's ribs col
lided with one of Hall's shoots, after
which Irwin smashed one to Kane. The
little fellow tossed to first and cut Ir
win off. James threw cleverly to the
plate, nabbing Spencer. Mohler man
aged to sneak through with the run
while the mixup was at its height.
It was a sort of one, two, three out
proposition with both teams till the
Seals started another scramble for runs
in the sixth. Walters got a walk and
advanced on Spencer's out. Hildebrand
put one out to right, anu Ike arrived
while McHale was booting the ball.
Hilde tore down to second, and when
Irwin clouted to Houtz's territory he
came right in. Houtz also played the
game Of juggle and did not return the
ball.
A good crowd saw the game, though
the management was disappointed at
the afternoon. Thf day was as fait a
one as ever visited the i*ity. The 36
< ents admission did not !< t& good to at
least three or four thousand fans. The
attendance was probably about 7500.
Without the raisÂ»e in price it would
surely have run up to 10,000.
Little Spencer played a swell game
of ball out in the right garden. He
also helped the first run aiong with his
double-baser. Kane v. as a busy man ;it
third. Hi? work is making a hit with
the fans, fur he plays the game all the

REPEAT VICTORY
Fast Work on Bags
Gives Angels
the Game.
LOS ANGELES, April 2. â Los An
geles played better ball than Portland
to-day and won by the score of 4 to 1.
The single run of the visitors was a
gift, Flood and Bernard allowng a pop
fly to drop between them without
either going after it. Both St. Vram
and Goodwin pitched high-class ball.
It was in base running that the locals
excelled. Both teams fielded well.

DOUBLE HEADER
Grand-Stand Finish
Puts the Tigers
to Rout
OAKLAND, April 2. â Two juicy
hunks of defeat were fed to Fisher's
tamed Tigers by Old Rip Van Haltren
and his understudies to-day in the
Idora Park arena. In the morning
struggle the dose the terrors of the
jungles were forced to gulp down w-as
marked " to 6. In the afternoon the
Tigers from Tacoma â¢ swallowed
another prescription labeled 3 to 1
that caused Magnate Mique to contort
his features as if he had been bunkoed
into taking a drink of tobasco sauce.
Both teams put in bush twirlers in
the forenoon contest, who added in
terest and uncertainty to the game
because of their unknown ability.
Fireman Fitzpatrick occupied the
box for Tacoma in the afternoon bat
tle. Schmidt of the perpetual smile
opposed the ex-blase quencher.
Schmidt's delivery was * cared for by
Midget McMurray, who made his de
but and was cordially greeted. Cap
tain Van's followers went right after
Fireman Fitz in the first inning as if
a general alarm had been sounded
and soon had the big fellow gome up
the ladder. When the 'bell" rang at
the close of the initial period Oakland
had scored two runs and three hits.
Their third and last tally was made
by the home players in the third in
ning. Van Haltren placed a safe one
in left field, went to second on
Francks' sacrifice and finished the
circuit on a corker that Dunleavy
propelled past Truck Eagan. Sheehan
scored Tacoma's lone run in the fifth.
He hit to right field and rambled to
second on Krug'er's failure to head off
the sphere. Tommy pilfered the third
cushion and came in on a drive to left
by Eagan. Schmidt allowed no more
than two safe bingles in any one in
nlr.g and these when they were of lit
tle value.
The morning game was captured .by
the home nine in the last inning. With
the score board reading 6 to 5 Dever
eaux was given first on four bad ones
by Thomas, who replaced Hastings in
this inning. Thomae then Jolted
Byrnes in the ribs with the sphere
whlai) went wild. Moskiman, who
supplanted Hopkins in the eighth in
ning, bunted one to Thomas, who tag
ged the medico out and then threw
wild to Sheehan to beat Devereaux.
The pellet went into left field. When
it was returned to the infield Dever
eaux and Byrnes had registered and
the game was over. Score:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY. APRIL 3, 1905
COUNTERFEITER
PUTS UP FIGHT
Arrested by Thomas B. Fos
ter. Secret Service Agent,
and Attempts to Escape
VISITS CIGAR STORES
His Specialty Is Ten-Cent
Pieces and Several Are Dis
covered in His Room
Thomas B. Foster, secret service
agent, made a clever capture of a coun
terfeiter on Saturday night. The sus
pect gave the name Harry Churchill,
but his real name is Harry Alexander.
Foster thinks his prisoner has served
a term in the penitentiary at Joliet, 111.
The fact that 10-cent 'pieces so per
fectly made that it was difficult for any
one but an expert to recognize them as
counterfeit were being circulated in the
city was brought to Foster's attention,
and he at once took steps to find the
culprit. Most of the coins had been
passed in cigar stores. Finally Foster's
suspicions fell upon Alexander, and
alter locating Alexander's room at 424
Dupont street he waited outside on
Saturday night for developments.
Alexander left the place between 7
and 8 o'clock, and Foster followed him
till he saw him enter the cigar store of
M. A. Gunst & Co., Sutter and Kearny
streets. Alexander purchased a 5-cent
package of tobacco and laid a 10-cent
piece on the counter. Foster grabbed
hold of both of Alexander's arms and
told the clerk not to put the dime in
the cash register. Alexander struggled
fiercely to get out of Fosters grasp,
and Foster called upon a young man to
help him. The young man responded
and Alexander was forced back into the
office.
Foster searched the prisoner and
found $70 in gold and $6 in silver in his
pockets, but could find no trace of
counterfeit 10-cent pieces. Foster hap
pened to take his eyes off Alexander
for an instant and Alexander planted
his elbow in Foster's stomach, knock
ing the breath out of him, and bolted.
He was intercepted by the clerk, and
before he could get away Foster and
the young man rushed upon him. The
handcuffs were placed over his wrists
and he was taken to the City Prison.
There Foster made another search and
found three of the counterfeit 10-cent
pieces. "Well," said Alexander, "you've
got me dead to rights."
Foster went to several cigar stores
and got three other counterfeit coins.
Then he went to Alexander's room and
remained on watch till 6 o'clock yester
day morning In the expectation that
Alexander might have a confederate,
but no one came, and Foster concluded
that Alexander had been working
alone. Accompanied by Sergeant Coo
gan and Policemen Duffy and Connors,
Foster made a search of the room and
found 145 counterfeit pieces, two plaster
of paris molds, metal ladles and other
paraphernalia, which were seized, be
sides eighty-four 5-cent packages of to
bacco.
Yesterday morning Alexander made a
full confession to Foster, saying that
he had been working alone for the last
five weeks. He said he got the idea
from reading in a newspaper about
counterfeiting. During the five weeks
he had passed on an average five of the
coins each night, which would total 175,
but Foster thinks he has been doing it
for more than five weeks. Alexander
says he is a barber by trade, but did
not work regularly- He wore a diamond
stud. The police will look into his rec
ord.

ALLEGED PLOT
TO BE SHOWN
Dental Board Member Says
That We Have Enough
Practitioners in California
MANY ARE IN THE RING
Dr. E. G. Howard of South
ern City Thinks Too Many
Are Engaged in Profession
Some persons seem to think that cer
tain members of the State Board of
Dental Examiners have conspired to
restrict the practice of dentistry In the
State of California. Dr. E. G. Howard,
a member of the board who resides in
Los Angeles, is credited with having
made the statement at the last meet
ing of the board in this city, December
26, last: "We do not want any more
dentists in California. There are
enough practitioners here now."
T. R. Woollard, who in his suit in
stituted March 24, against the State
Board of Dental Examiners charged
Dr. Fred W. Baird, a member of the
board with offices at 502 Sutter street,
with a conspiracy to keep down the
number of dentists in California, claims
that he will be able to prove his asser
tions. His attorney, Sanford Feigen
baum, is now at work collecting a mass
Of important evidence to sustain the al
legations set forth in the suit.
Attorney Feigenbaum says that he
will show by witnesses and sworn affi
davits that Dr. Fred G. Baird, presi
dent of the State Board, has granted
temporary licenses to at least three
known persons without first having
subjected them to the examination re
quired by law. Woollard alleges that
he was denied a temporary license
after having passed a rigid and im
practicable examination before Dr.
Baird. He also alleges that Baird's
animosity toward him was openly
shown before and during the examina
tion. He says that Baird, although re
quired by the dental law to give him
an examination upon application for
the issuance of a temporary license,
lefused to examine him as to his quali
fications as a dentist. Woollard states
that it was only after he secured the
services of an attorney that Baird con
descended to give him the examination.
Then he says the questions put to him
were rigid and impracticable.
Woollard retained a duplicate copy |
of his examination. The questions, ten
in number, he thinks would certainly \
not give any examiner the slightest in-
Bight into the qualifications of the ap- |
plicant. Five of the questions put to
Woollard were intended to elicit- infor- |
mation as to the many and varied :
clauses of the dental law. One of the
questions which Baird thought might
determine a man's worth as a dentist ;
was, "What is the amount of the fee
imposed upon practicing dentists and
known as a license fee? When and to
whom is it payable?"
Four other such questions comprised
one-half of the examination to deter
mine the applicant's fitness to practice
dentistry.
Woollard and hie attorney further at
lege that Baird did not prepare the
questions himself, but sought the aid
of one Dr. Frank Platt. The suit
comes up for hearing on the 7th in
stant.
The dentists of the State are said to
be up in arms against the actions of
Howard and Baird and say that Dr. C.
A. Herrick of Jackson, Amador county,
secretary of the board, is "in the ring"
to keep down the number of dentists
in the State.

RESTOREDJIS HAIR
Scalp Humor Cured by Cuticura
Soap and Ointment
AFTER ALL ELSE FAILED
"I was troubled with a severe scalp
humor and loss of hair that gave me a
great deal of annoyance and inconven-

many remedies and so-called hair .

CONTEST BRINGS
A RECORD VOTE
Election of French Society
Directors Eesults in the
Casting of 1437 Ballots
OLD BOARD VICTORIOUS
Xo Trouble at Hall, Though
Wire Pulling Is Lively
and Fraud Is Charged
The French Mutual Benevolent So
ciety held its annual election yester
day at Native Sons' Hall and it called
forth nearly as strong a vote and as
fully much electioneering as is pro
duced in the average district at a city
primary. The present members of the
old board were up for re-election and
there was an opposition ticket of
eight, which if elected would have
given its supporters a majority of one
on the board and probably resulted
in a cleaning out of the French
Hospital. The old board was re
elected, though, by an average of
400 votes.
Dr. E. It. Berges was elected one of
the two house visiting physicians,
beating Dr. G. M. Converse, who failed
of re-election.
The election brought forth 1437
votes, the largest number ever cast at
an election of the society. Last year
1140 votes were cast, which was the
record up to yesterday.
Though there was no trouble of any
sort at the hall, there were many
acrimonious statements and also talk
of contesting the election on the part
of some who aided the opposition
ticket- Charges were made that the
by-laws had been violated by allow
ing members who had belonged only
three months and minors to vote,
whereas the laws say that the elective
franchise shall be given only tÂ« those
who have belonged six months and
who have reached their majority. It
was also charged that repeating was
practiced, the allegation being made
that some members had voted as
many as three times through the con
nivance of some of the election of
ficers. It was also charged that the
names of absent members had been
voted.
The regulars, headed by O. Bozio,
president of the society, laughed at
these statements, pronounced them
ridiculous and said that everything
was being conducted with a fairness
that would meet the approval even
of the present finical Grand Jury, and
the balloting went merrily on. The
opposition party, which was headed
by F. Santallier, knew it was beaten
before the election was half over, but
it kept up its fight bravely until the
closing of the polls at 6 o'clock.
A. Roncovieri, who headed the list
with 981 votes, received the support
of the Bergerots and also the San
talliers.
The result of the election means
that there will probably be no
changes in the officers of the society
nor in the hospital staff.
Following is the vote for directors,
the first fifteen, constituting the old
board, being elected: O. Bozio, 910;
A. Roncovieri, 981; T. Lacoste, 938; E.
A. Lemoine, 899; J. A. Bergerot, 887;
Remond Aguirre, 891; Charles Arti
gues. 936; J. Bergen, 928; F. Carries,
802; J. S. Godeau. 898; A. Gless, 893;
B. P. Lapachet, 891; J. B. Pon, 886;
G. Pouchan, 880; J. Coudeu, 879; I.
Cuenin, 505; E. Legallet. 521; R.
Lavigne, 526; E. Messager, 505; A.
Ortion. 499; B. Relss. 502; F. San
tallier, 500; E. E. Thiele. 506.
The eight last named constituted
the opposition ticket.
There were three medical places to
be filled by the election. Dr. J. E.
Artigues was again chosen visiting
physician for the hospital without op
position. For the two house visiting
places the vote was as follows: Dr.
E. R. Berges. "15; Dr. M. H. Etch
everry, 872, and Dr. G. M. Converse,
615.

MAY FORESTALL
HEWITT'S ORDER
Workmen from the Department of
Electricity will start in bright and
early this morning with the task of
tearing down telegraph poles and
wires in the various downtown dis
tricts. Chief Engineer William R.
Hewitt of the department issued an
order on Saturday that the obstruc
tions must come down if the compa
nies do not comply with the law by
Monday morning.
There is liable to be a fight before
the work of removing the poles and
wires is completed. The various com
panies operating overhead wires com
plain that they have not b3en notified
in time, and it is more than likely
they will take legal steps to prevent
Hewitt from carrying out his pro
posed plan.
The overhead poles and wir^s have
caused a lot of trouble and discussion
in the Department of Electricity and
the Board of Public Works for many
months. Efforts have frequently been
made to compel the telegraph and
telephone companies to place tHeir
wires underground, but in many in
stances the orders have not been com
plied with.
Louis Glass, vice president of the
telephone company, thinks his cor
poration has not been treated right
by Hewitt and objects strenuously to
the order that was issued.
"We did not hear a word about
this till late last night," said Mr.
Glass, "and I do not see what chance
we have to obey the command in such
a short space of time.
"I suppose that we can do nothing
but look on if the work of tearing
down the poles and wires commences
thi3 morning. We have not as yet
taken any legal steps to prevent the
move, and I cannot say what we will
do If the worst comes to the worst.
The directors of the company will
meet this morning, and they may
agree on legal measures to prevent
the work of demolition.
Even if the wires are torn out It
will not interfere with our business to
any extent. It may cut us out of a
few circuits, but the damage can
easily be repaired. We should have
been warned before this by Chief
Hewitt, for then we would have had
a chance to either place Â»ur wires
underground or show cause why we
should not."
Frank Jaynes, superintendent of
the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany and the American District Mes
senger Service, says he was not
warned by Chief Hewitt that the wires
and poles of the company were about
to be torn out.
"I know nothing about the matter
and I guess there is nothing to it,"
said Jaynes last night. "If Hewitt
were going to do anything like that
he should have notified me. We are
unprepared now, but we will certainly
do something if they begin tearing
out our wires."
If the overhead poles and wires are
taken down this morning it will play
havoc with a number of small mes
senger companies. These concerns
depend almost entirely on their over
head wires, and it will mean ruin
for them if their business is delayed
It is likely that the various compa
nies will hold a joint conference thiÂ«
morning and agree on ways and
means whereby Hewitt's pl an "may be
defeated. Injunctions may be tried
though the telegraph and telephone
magnates will not affirm this rumor

How's Your
Complexion?
If your complexion is muddy, sal-
low and pimply you are probably
troubled with a torpid liver and mora
or less constipation. You must have
a movement of the bowels each day;
otherwise the bile from the liver and
impurities of the body become ab-
sorbed into the blood instead of being
carried off through the natural chan-
nels, the bowels. Look more after
your diet, â  avoiding greasy foods and
rich pastries. Partake more freely of
vegetable foods.' Take one

(50 tablets) and trial size (15 tablets)
