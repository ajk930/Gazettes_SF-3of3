MUKDEN.Oct. 18.â The fighting of
the 17th was confined to the Russian
center at Shakhe Riv*er and was most
ly artillery fire, the Japanese using
big guns and high explosive shells.
During the nine days of continuous
fighting the 'Russian losses were never
less than 2000 per day. The hospitals
are hardly able to handle the wound
ed. Nevertheless they have performed
wonders.
The Chinese have deserted all the
villages and the troops are using the
woodwork of their houses for fuel.
The country south is desolated. The
Japanese still seem to be exerting
themselves .to force the Russians out
of Mukden. A battle in the positions
surrounding the town Is certain. It
becomes more and more evident that
the resources of the country cannot
support a large army. This season's
crops 'are spoiled.

"It won't 'hurt him," was. the com

the young saloon-keeper's usual good
spirits appeared to forsake him when
he learned- that he must go to prison
for the night. . ;
Charles Wyman was = held yesterday
to answer ; 'in '.the \ Superior Court to
the charge 'of Â¦illegal" voting at the pri
mary election; Police Judge Cabaniss
rendered his -'-decision immediately
after the taking of testimony had been
closed and fixed bail at the same
amount it has been during the pre
liminary examination, $4000 bond or
$2500 cash.; "
The attorney â¢ for the prisoner Â¦' at
once-sued out a- writ of habeas corpus
before Judge Carroll Cook, which was
made returnable this morning at 10
o'clock. Reckoning of counsel was
faulty, however, for the Judge refused
to release the . petitioner on bail until
the Sheriff 'shall .have brought him
into court. â¢ Wyman therefore * had to
spend the night .behind the;bars---the
first experience- he has ; had ; in Â¦'; a; cell
since his arrest, r bail; having: always
been at his command.
' 'When. :the. prosecution had ."an
nounced the close of its case Attorney.
Countryman -made ;*a formal motion
for! dismissal, . his grounds being that
the people* had failed to prove that a
primary " : election | was held, that the
primary law wasunconstitutional. that
there. was flagrant contradiction in the
testimony of the witnesses and that
the preliminary hearing- had proceeded
while . the | habeas, corpus j j proceedings
were pending before "Judge Sloss. ' '
Judge Cabaniss denied the motion,
and,, when asked, Attorney Country

It Is reported that General Mistchen

An officer, who has" just returned from

that a sanguinary fight has taken place
at Laitkhezi, fifteen miles south of
Shakhe, > to which fort j General - Mist
chenko retired in order to preserve
communication between the Russian
center and the eastern flank.
The Japanese made a determined ef
fort to cut the line of communication
at this point and attacked under cover
of a terrific cannonade. Out of one
company of a Russian rifle brigade only
fifty men were left. ' Two companies
that had expended their ammunition
prior to the last Japanese attack lay
in the trenches until the Japanese were
within a few paces. Then the Russians
hurled a volley of stones, charged. and
broke the -attacking" line," compelling
the Japanese to flee.- z\\\ ::
There ' was : fighting .to-day on both
sides of the Great Mandarin - road.
General Kuropatkin is indefatigable,
personally directing the forward opera
tions. * Nothing seems to affect him,
but he wears his usual quiet smile un
der all circumstances. â¢
:The last Japanese defenders of Lone
Tree Hill, two artillery officers, refused
quarter and died fighting, with their
swords beside their, guns..
FURIOUS JAPANESE ATTACK.
It is reported that the Japanese made
a furious attempt to take a wooded hill
near â¢ Da Pass last night. The I firing
began at 11 o'clock' and continued with
rifle and - "cannon - through - the. night.
This action probably was a part of an
attempt by. the Japanese, who were al
ready in possession of small hills in the
plains, -to rush the center along the
foothills at the Shakhe. River. '
'It rained all last knight, but the roar
of the artillery did not cease for a mo
ment. To-dav broke cold and with a
cutting wind.. The roads have, been
ruined bv the rain.
'Cossacks brought in captured guns
and Japanese "-wounded prisoners - on
October 17. Russian soldiers surround
ed the prisoners and gave them bread
and water and in other ways tried to
relieve their, wants. '
repopulated. All the roads are crowd-*
, ed with army traffic.
The fighting on October IS was most
severe. Fifty wounded were coasted
In one hour passing a point on one
country pathway. Already the casual
ties reported are so great as to confirm
the declaration of the leaders that the
â¢present conflict would be the bloodiest
in history. * It is not possible to-day to
make any close estimate of the Rus
sian casualties.
Â¦ The Russians appear to hold posi
tions in the plain, along the Shakhe
River, extending from the railway to
Da Pass, beginning at the mountains,
but the. bitterness and tenacity. of the
fight indicates certain conditions In the
Eastern army about which Uttla 13
' iMter a threatening day the Japan
ese, beginning at 11 o'clock on t>.e night
of October* 15, rushed the village of
Linchenpo, on the north bank of the
Shakhe River, and west of the rail
way, precipitating - a thundering can
nonade and fusilade, which continued
until midnight, the rifle fire continuing
until dawn.
The Japanese now occupy the raised
temple quadrangle near Linchenpo, the
only eminence for miles around, and
which affords an unusual advantage
for observation and artillery flre
against the Russian right. Several at
tempts to dislodge them have failed.
To-day Japanese were railing at Chan
chiapo, near Paitapo, showing that the
heavy and continuous -Russian can
nonade has been ineffective.

Ii\ order* to give ihe electors a clear
Jdea y of the situation the report outlines
the programme of the Cabinet, saying
that in their home" policy the Ministers
will not change the programme fol
lowed since February. 1901. namely, the
most ample liberty within the limits
of the law.
'The extreme parties." the Premier
says, "abused this liberty, but recent
events must have taught them that if
they have strength to arouse the
masses, even' without serious reasons,
the worst elements can take advantage
of it, so that the extreme parties be
come responsible for. . their excesses,
which no honest person can approve
and which render necessary efficacious
action on the part of the Government
to protect public order without which
the cause of liberty would soon be lost
Therefore the Cabinet proposes to in
crease the forces at the disposal of the
police and to provide for the better ed
ucation, Â« especially " Â¦ of the middle
classes." Â¦>* Â¦ Â¦ ' ' *
The report also announces that it is
the intention of the Cabinet to have
the railroads return under the control
of the Government, to introduce logi
cal and serious reform in taxation and
undertake the conversion of the state
debt, which would already have been
accomplished had Â¦ it not been for" the
war in the Far East, which disturbed
the financial markets of the world, and
declares that a reduction of the mili
tary budget of the state, is absolutely
irreconcilable with the security of the
country, although the alliances and
friendships of Italy with the surround
ing po*wers assure the preservation of
peace.
The defense of the* state; it is added,
cannot be improvised when danger sud
denly arises, but must be lengthily pre
pared. When alliances are* made" and
maintained among strong peoples they
can never, for the dignity of the coun
try, assume the. form ;Â¦ of protection.
Therefore the necessity to be strong
and secure is deeply felt -more by the
people than by the - Government, and
consequently the countries ruled by the
niost popular form of government have
rapidly augmented their military ex
penses more than other countries un
der . different forms of government
The report of Signor Giolltti begins
with reviewing the work of the Cabinet
since it has been in power, and says it
was hoped that the Cabinet would be
able to continue with the present
Chamber the solution of two great
problemsâ the commercial treaties and
the settlement of the railroad question.
Continuing, the report says:
"But the country has been deeply
disturbed by disorders artificially pro
voked without reason, which have cre
ated such a state of things that it is
difficult for the present Chamber to
maintain the /serenity necessary for
the/ discussion hi j thofe , vital j pro
gramra'es on 'which* may /depend the
economic future of Italy for many
years." ' â¢ . ' '
The decree was accompanied by a
report of the Premier, setting forth the
situation and giving the Government's
programme as liberty, order and peace,
for which the Cabinet asks the support
of the electors. All the Ministers. join

Ministry Answers the Agita
tion With a Declaration
in Full of the Programme
It Intends to Carry "Out
There is no official confirmation
here of the report from Tokio that a
Russian attack on the Japanese right
on October 17 had been repulsed. ' If
â¢this ' report proves true it may Involve
serious consequences for the -Rus
sians who crossed the Shakhe while
the river was fordable. According" to
the press Mukden dispatches, the
water has since risen man-high in con
sequence of heavy rains, and ; therefore
it would be well nigh impossible | for
the Russian army to recross the river,
owing to the absence of . bridges. ,: It
would be equally difficult, for' the same
reason. :to bring supports; supplies and
ammunition to enable General .Kuro
patkin to follow up this advance. :
This may. explain the statement in a
Mukden . dispatch that the fighting
was slackening on the morning ,of
October IS. â¢ . '; -.:-Â¦â¢'

vance \vhen7 telegraphing to-night, the

SLAV. COLUMN IX PERIL.
The reverse . sustained ."by// General
Yamada's column hns not yet been re
ported by General Kuropatkin or Gen
eral Sakharoff except in a reference to
an unsuccessful Japanese attack near
Shakhe. The press dispatch from
Mukden evidently refers to this affair
in reporting that the Japanese left had
been beaten off with a terrible slaugh
ter and Its retreat cut off by a Russian
army corps. ' â¢;',"
Correspondents at the front for the
past forty-eight hours had been hint
ing that the Russian army was on the
eve of another advance, but it was
thought here that the troops were too
exhausted by more than a week of
titanic struggle to engage in an imme
diate advance movement. Therefore
the definite news' of the resumption of
the advance was calculated to arouse
the greater satisfaction; but the
realization of the "significance of news
permeates the masses here more slow
ly than in American cities. The kaleid
oscopic changes on the Shakhe River
have been too swift for the populace to
follow, and so the better news from tho
front has been so far taken with com
parative quiet. In the best Informed
circles, however, it is already accepted
as true: If is believed that General
Kuropatkin intended to signalize the
Czarevitch's fete by a victory, just as
Grand Duke Nicholas did at Plevna.
GENERAL YA3IADA'S REVERSE.
The failure of the War Office to give
out dispatches is attributed to. the hol
iday, the censors' commission disband
ing early. However, it is learned on
;?ood authority that the Emperor has
received a telegram from General Ku
ropatkin reporting that the Russians
are moving forward. . .
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 19 (2:50
a. m.).â There is jubilation throughout
the city over the news that General
Kuropatkin has resumed the offensive,
and the holiday, which began with lit-
I tie heart, closed brighter. The crowds
in the streets and the illuminations in
honor of the Czarevitch's name day
gave a tinge of brilliancy to an even-
I ing otherwise depressing through a
drizzle of rain. Newsboys up
to midnight raced through the thor
oughfares with evening extras, shout
ing, "Great Russian victory!" and
. crowds bought ..the papers greedily.
I Groups of .men' in brilliant uniforms
or, in evening dress at the hotels and
restaurants-, discussed the change in
the fortunes of war, but the popula
tion as a whole was slow to take fire.
It had received the news of the earlier
reverses stolidly, and now accepted re
ports of Russian successes and the
capture of guns quietlyâ with satisfac
tion, but with considerable reserve. '

"General Kuropatkin .the following
day ordered the hill to be retaken and
the whole Russian artillery concen
trated at 5 o'clock in the morning
and showered the hill with projectiles,
the awful spectacle lasting the entire
day. It seemed that no human being
could outlive such an ordeal, yet the
defenders remained manfully at their
posts.
The Russian losses were terrible.
The fighting on the crest of the hill
was altogether with cold steel. The
Russian officers, with swords aloft,
leading the scaling column, were lit
erally lifted into the air by the Japan
ese bayonets and the Japanese then
bayoneted the first of the Russian sol
diers who piled into the trenches. All
the dead in the trenches were bay

of the dreadful combat. Â¦..Â¦â¢â¢
Nemirovich Danchenko, the well
known Russian war correspondent,
telegraphs a description of the storm
ing of Lone Tree HI1L This eminence
had first been taken by the Japanese
in a night attack. He says:
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 18. â The
general staff believes that the storm
ing of Lone Tree Hill, for valor and
slaughter, will occupy a place by itr
self in military annals. Kuropatkin,
under whose eye the assault was
made, rechristened it Poutiloff Hill in
honor of the men who led the attack,
at the head of the Second Brigade of
the East Siberian rifle division and
who were subsequently decorated on
the field with the St. George's Cross.
The hill is a precipitous, rocky
height and although the Japanese had
occupied it only a short time they had
thrown up very strong defenses. The
river running at its foot increased the
difficulty of the task, but it was scaled
and carried successfully against the
unprecedented opposition of a Japan
ese division (14,000 men) with many
guns.
VALOR AND SLAUGHTER.
The fighting to-day slackened con
siderably, owine to rain and the im
passable condition of the roads.
The battlefield of Lone Tree Hill.pre
sents the most awful spectacle that can
be conceived. Russian and Japanese
dead are mingled In heaps in inex
tricable confusion. The ground is
strewn with broken rifles that had been
smashed in hand to hand fighting.
Everything seems to have been utilized
as weapons. The Russian doctors are
working heroically on the slopes of the
hill in the attempt to save those of the
wounded who still survive, but the
Japanese keep up a snipping fire and
render the v.-^rk of relief difficult and
dangerous.

MONTREAL", Ont., Oct. 18.â Canada,
is considerably upset to-night by news
from London of the resignation of
Charles M. Hays, second vice president
and general manager of the Grand
Trunk Railway system and general
manager of the proposed Grand Trunk
Pacific, which is to run across the con
tinent and rival in every particular the
Canadian Pacific Railway.
The building of the new road, which
will , cost the : Government of Canada
$113,000,000, and which is to be turned
over to the Grand Trunk, Is one of the
main issues upon which the - present
election is being fought, and November
3 next is being looked forward to with
profound anxiety by both the Liberal
party, now in power, and the Conserv
atives. In the midst of this anxiety
comes the resignation of Hays.
* What has brought , it . about is mere
cpjecture, as far as has > been learned
as yet. It is assumed here that some
trouble has arisen in connection with
the Pacific extensi' -Â» of - the Grand
Trunk, and there Is fear that the
project may fail. Hays was the most
conspicuous figure in making Pacific
Coast plans. It, is declared by many
that Hays has fallen out with Sir Wil
frid / Laurler over details of the scheme.
Hays was- formerly president i of the
Southern Pacific.

Says It. Is Out of General Politics, but
? Indorses Certain 'Judicial
Candidates.
The following circular letter has
been issued by the Citizens' Alliance
of San Francisco to members, asking
them to vote for and urge the election
of the candidates for the judicial
bench ; mentioned in the resolution
embodied in the letter:
October 11, 1904.
To Members: The executive committee- of
the Citizens' Alliance has absolutely decided
to keep politics out of the organization, and
the organization .out of politics, and believes it
would be a great mistake to undertake to as
sert Itself positively by placing a ticket on the
official ballot.
The success of our association, however, de
pends largely upon the fairness and honesty of
the Judiciary. AVe must have competent, fear
less and unbiased .Judges to successfully main
tain law and order. A movement is on foot
to elevate well-known | labor sympathizers to
the bench at the expense of the incumbents. In
the opinion of the executive committee the
election of men pledged to class politics would
greatly retard the work of the Citizens' Alli
ance, and for the purpose of enlightening: our
members the executive committee met on Sat
urday, October 8, and adopted the resolution
which , appears . below. ,' W,-. .'..-.
It is not our, desire > to dictate to members,
but we urge upon all of them the Importance
of lending their assistance at this time to the
end that a better understanding may be
brought about between employer" and employe,
and a condition of Industrial equilibrium estab
lished:
Whereas, - At â¢Â¦ the coming municipal election
four Superior - Judges are to be elected for a
term of nix years; and
~ ; > Whereas. It . Is essential to the welfare of
this community that upright and . Independent
men should be elected to the bench; and
Â¦Whereas, The Importance of the judicial of
fice is such that the individuals best qualified
for the public service should be , supported,
apart from considerations of political : faith or
party indorsement; and ; 
. -Whereas,; The ; incumbents â the Hon. J. M.
Seawell, Hon. James M. Troutt. Hon. Frank
J. Murasky and the Hon.. Frank H. Kerrigan â
have, during their = respective terms upon â¢ the
bench,. now about expiring, demonstrated their
fitness for the Judicial office and have by the
faithful execution of -their: duties as Judges
won the : right to re-election; now, therefore, 1
be-it Â¦ â¢,: - - Â¦ -â¢â¢'Â¦ Â¦Â¦ â¢ ' ' Â¦ â¢'.- ' . v . â¢â¢;

MODESTO, Oct. 18.â Delegates to the
second annual congress of the Califor
nia Irrigation Association met in con
vention in Rogers Hall this morning.
The convention was called to order by
A. M. Drew, president of the organiza
tion. A large^number of delegates are
present at the" convention, the southern
counties being exceptionally well rep
resented. Among the delegates there
Is much enthusiasm and when the con
vention was called to order the' mem
bers settled down to work with readi
ness and without a hitch. .:>>-Â¦
The feature of the morning session
was an address of welcome bjr Dr.
Dickenson of Ceres, who struck the
keynote of the convention and received
hearty applause when he said: Â¦
"Mr. Chairman and friends â The
pleasure and duty falls to nie to extend
to you a word of welcome. I do this
gladly because you come as the repre
sentatives of a cause which is just now
paramount in' our thoughts and upon
which will depend much of the success
and prosperity of the country in the
future. It depends chiefly upon the
variable factor in our physical envi
ronments which we call weather. The
man who helps to eliminate from the
industry of agriculture its. uncertain
elements and substitutes for them a
measure of assurance and certainty Is
a benefactor of the race. He who can
help us to control a timely and propor
tionate distribution of moisture over
the world's productive fields does a
greater service than he who harnesses
the steam in the interests of traffic, for
transportation is subordinate to pro
duction and depending upon it. We
welcome you as the representatives of
that science which Is to control and
distribute the waters over our arid
lands. The discussions and conclusions
of such a body as this is of greater im
portance to the life and well being of
our nation than those of any sociolog
ical or political bodies."
The remainder of the morning was
spent -in the organization of the con
vention, the appointment of committees
and other work. -' On the committee on
resolutions were appointed Scipio
Craig of Redlands, John G. Worth of
Riverside, Elwood Mead of the State
University, R. D. McPherson of Impe
rial and L. L. Dennett of. Stanislaus.
Addresses were delivered in the after
noon and evening by Elwood Mead, A.

There was every indication of a des
perate struggle in the house and . it
is believed that after the young mother

dered to ke^p her from making known
the identity of her assailant. Appar
ently she had been shot down when
trying to flee into the open.

BOSTON, Oct. 18.â The divorce issue
again came before the Episcopal con-
Jvefition to-day, but no final action was
I taken on several resolutions referring
i to subjects which were presented. The
! House of , Bishops sent a message to
j the deputies informing, them that the
i .Bishops had voted to forbid the remar
' riage of any divorced persons, but when
the matter was laid before the deputies
on the question of concurrence Rev.
Doctors Lewis Parks and W. D. Hunt
j ington, both of New York, immediately
I set the parliamentary machinery in
j motion to defeat or at least sidetrack
' the Bishops' resolution.
! After a brief but spirited skirmish
! the matter was referred to the commit
' tee on canons, from which it can be
J called at any time. During the fore
noon several resolutions favoring a
! stricter canon on carriage and divorce
j were referred to a committee. .'. .
| The divorce matter again came to the
I fore through a resolution by George
Fester Peabody of Brooklyn, calling
for the appointment of twelvehn'erh
; bers of both houses to consider
! the entire question and report to the
j next" general convention. The commit
i tee is to confer with other religious
! bodies as to some uniform standard of
I legislation bearing on marriage and.di
vorce. It was referred to the commit
tee on canons.
:'-\A>joint commission, appointed three
years ago, presented an extended re
port, recommending that all dioceses
and missionary districts be grouped to
seven provinces, each province to have
authority to legislate on matters which
do not conflict with "the general con
vention. Each province is to elect a
primate to preside over it. The report
will be acted upon later.
The House of Deputies to-day decid
ed to refer a proposition to elect a!
negro Bishop for the Southern States
to the next convention.
The House of Bishops nominated Rev.
Logan F. Roots of Arkansas for Bishop
of Hankow, China; Rev. Frank S. Â¦
Spalding of Erie, Pa., for Bishop of]
Salt Lake, and Rev. A. TV. Knight of:
Atlanta, Ga., for Bishop of Cuba. The i
nominations will have to be ratified
j by the House of Deputies to become
effective. : "-)i'lx^\"i-
The House of Bishops to-day adopted
the following section as part of the
canon oir divorce:; _-
"The judgment of the Bishop shall
always be taken before a divorced" per
soa, who has a former husband or wife,
.stlll' living, jand -whof >is married to'
another, "may be confirmed or permit
ted to receive the "holy communion;
provided, that the sacraments shall in
no case be refused to any penitent per
son in imminent danger of death/ nor
to the innocent party in a divorce
granted for adultery.".
The effect of -this action is to make
the regulations cf the church more
binding and more definite.
In the House of Deputies the commit
tee on amendments to : the constitution
reported a definition of the words
"within the boundaries of the United

The committee construed that phrase

tory and possessions within the juris
diction of the United States, and not
merely that territory- lying between the
Atlantic and Pacific and between Can

LONDON, Oct. 18.â The demand of
Great Britain for an ;> indemnity of
$3,750,000 from . the Tibetans appears
likely to lead to a prolonged British
occupation of the Chumbi Valley.
The Tibetans declared their inability
to pay the indemnity within the three
years first stipulated, and Great Brit
tain has now proposed that the pay
ments be made at the rate of $50,000
yearly and that until the whole sum
is paid the British retain possession
of this, valley, which Is the key to
Tibet.
The Tibetans are said to approve of
the proposal, but China's opposition to
the ratification of the treaty is in
creasing, causing fear that the Dalai
Lama and his Russian associate may
be induced to return to Lassa and
upset the British calculations. -
Germany's attempt at Peking to pre
vent China ratifying the L.assa treaty
provoked the Globe this afternoon into
a vehement attack on the Kaiser. It
demands that Lord Lansdowne order
Wilhelm fo stand out of the way of
Britain's interests in Asia or prepare
to be pushed out of the way. The
Kaiser is designated as a meddler in
affairs tjiat do not concern him. He is
requested to examine the records of
Lansdowne and Curzon if he imagines
they can be bluffed.
. It must be admitted that the action
of Germany has produced a bad mood
at the Foreign Office and given a shock
to diplomatic circles. It is said that
Lansdowne's expectation of German
meddling relative to Lassa caused him
much- uneasiness and led him to post
pone negotiations with China concern
ing Weihaiwei lest they should furnish
the Kaiser with a broader platform on
which to build an anti-British case in
Asia.
PEKING, Oct. 18.â The German Min
ister, Baron Mumm . von Schwartzen
stein, and Captain Truppel, Governor of
Kiaochau (the German protectorate on
the Shantung Peninsula) were received
in audience yesterday by the Emperor
and the Dowager Empress. Captain
Truppel was decorated with the Order
of the Double Dragon.
Subsequently' Madame Truppel and
the ladies of the diplomatic body were
received in audience, and Madame
Truppel was presented with a portrait
of the Dowager Empress .painted by
her own hand.
; .Both receptions .were entirely formal.
Nevertheless the decoration of: Captain
Truppel and the present . made to his
wife are looked upon aa indicating that
the Chinese Government is entirely sat
isfied with the attitude of Germany
toward China.
There have been no further develop
ments in the situation growing: out of
the signing of the treaty between the
British mission to Tibet and the Ti
betan authorities.
PARIS, Oct. 18. â Parliament re
assembled to-day in extraordinary ses
sion. A lively incident occurred in the
corridors between 'Pugliesi-Conti (Re
publican) and Celestine Bose, a late
Bonapartist candidate. The latter
hissed Pugliesi-Conn, who' responded,
with blows from his umbrella. The
two were eventually separated.
Brisson presided in the Chamber,
where many interpellations were pre
sented. Premier Combes, on behalf
of the Ministry, proposed that the
Chamber first discuss the interpella
tions relative to the rupture with
Rome and thereafter the Marseilles
strike and the charge against the ad
minstration of the War Office. The
proposal brought on a spirited contro
versy.
It was finally decided by a majority
of 100 to discuss the interpellations
in the order desired by the Premier.
A further proposal to discuss interpel
lations on Fridays only, in order to
prevent the blocking of business, was
carried by a majority of twenty-five.
In the Senate the proceedings were
purely formal, ' the President of the
Senate pronouncing a eulogy on the
late Waldeck-Rousseau and other
Senators who had died since adjourn
ment. The Senate then closed its pes
sion for the day.

XEW YORK, Oct. 18.â The politi
cal situations in Indiana and New

fairs of the Democratic campaign
considered by Judge Parker after he
arrived here to-day. A report was
made to. ; hinV concerning Indiana by
Simon ; P; Sheril, who was secretary

It Is said the conference did much
to shape the contest to be waged by
Indiana Democrats for supremacy in
the election. The announcement was
made bv Indianans who. called on
Judge Parker . that . the prospects of
carrying Indiana, as shown bv a
fourth "canvass, were encouraging. No
figures were given out.
â¢In New Jersey the situation is re
ported to be far more complex than
in any of the doubtful. States, and the
result more dependent upon the work
done in the remaining two and one
half weeks of the campaign. This
was the judgment of former Senator

false claim in regard to securing $22,000
for the upper Sacramento River. He
said no river and harbor bill was
passed by the last Congress, but upon
recommendation of Major Heuer $22,
000 was given the upper Sacramento
f rorr. the emergency appropriation - of
$3,000,000. Gillett reviewed his work in
Congress to aid the settlers in Mono
County, to aid the hydraulic miners,
to secure pensions for the old soldiers
and to relieve various . counties from
the encroachment of forest reserves.
He punctured many ridiculous claims
made by his opponent, Camlnetti, who
claimed that he had secured the re
moval of duty on grain bags and thus
deserved the gratitude of California
farmers. Gillett read a telegram from
Collector Stratton of S*n Francisco
saying that Caminetti had never intro
duced a bill to repeal the duty on
grain bags or jute. He told how Cam
inetti had sought, when . in Congress,
to defeat the appropriation of $750,000
secured for Eureka haroor by Con
gressman Geary.
Wool, cattle and lumber are the lead
ing products of Tehama County, and it
was told how Caminetti voted. to put
these on the free list. Gillett made a
most excellent impression and he will
be given a large majority in Tehama
County.
Hon. T. H. Selvage of Eureka, candi
date for State Senator, followed Gillett,
and made a strong and convincing ar
gument on national issues. He also
made a good impression.

Some 600 of the employes of the Union
Iron Works assembled at the noon hour
yesterday to hear E. A. Hayes, Repub
lican candidate for Congress in the
Fifth Congressional District. Mr.
Hayes was introduced by A. D. Porter,
business manager of the Brotherhood
of Boilermakers and Iron Ship Builders
of America. Mr. Porter pointed out that
the interests of the workingmen lie
with the administration that is in pow
er and with the Republican Congress
that will continue in power after the
coming election; that a Republican
Congressman would be able to obtain
appropriations for the building of war
ships here to the great benefit of the
men of, the iron works, and that their
interests are in securing the election of
such a Congressman. He laid stress on
the necessity of sending a man to Con
gress who would favor the merchant
marine.
Mr. Hayes spoke of his great interest
In the workmen of this country, .having
been born on . a Wisconsin farm and
having employed labor during the last
twenty years; that in all his relations
with workingmen he had never had any
friction that had not been adjusted to
their satisfaction; that he treated his
employes as coworkers and had always
insisted upon his foremen refraining
from cursing and from antagonizing
those under his charge; that he had
never employed- Mongolian labor and
believed not only in the exclusion of it,
but in its deportation. He declared for
eight hours for the working day and
even for, less in some -.employments. He
dwelt for some, time on the question of
protection , and showed, how their : true
interests .lie in maintaining . this doc
trine and putting it in force by a high
tariff- upon^the products of cheap for
eign labor so as to enable the workmen
of America to compete successfully
against such importations. On these
matters and his declarations for the
encouragement of home manufactures
his remarks met with great approval.
Mr. Hayes was listened to attentively
and his hearers left him reluctantly.
From the Union Iron Works Mr. Hayes
and his party went to Lachman &
Jacbbi's, where he met the employes
and delivered a short address.
FIGHT IN THE FIFTH.
headquarters of the Commercial Trav
elers' League. Judge Parker's letter,
which is addressed to the committee
on arrangements, was as follows:
Gentlemen: Ulster County neighbors cannot
be excelled anywhere. Neighbors once, they are
neighbors always. Years may pass. A son of
rister may settle far from home. He may sel
dom sen one of the faces so familiar in the
old days. But Ulster County is always home
to him, and no new friends can take the place
of the old neighbors.
I want to say Just a word about the sig
nificance of your meeting. It is well that the
eons of Ulster County should bear a part in
the great struggle for government by the rule
of the constitution, v
The Federal constitution ls a chart that sets
forth the course the ship of state shall sail to
Insure a safe voyage. By it government is di
vided into three departments. Each depart
ment is to perform Ha proper and specified
functions.
This ls popular government in its most per
fect form. So long as each department per
forms the functions and only those conferred
upon it by the people through the constitution
k> long are we safe. Under Republican admin
istration this rule has been disregarded. One
of the branches of .the national Government
has on occasions gone beyond its authority and
usurped functions withheld from It by the
constitution.
Therefore, this is the issue: "Shall the ship
of etate sail by the people's chart or at ran
dom?"
I repeat. It ls well that the voice of the
people of Ulster County is heard on the side of
constitutionalism.
With warm ifreetlngs and best wishes for
each of you, I am very faithfully youra.

Congressman Bell's attempt to ap
propriate to himself the- credit for this
legislation is the rawest sample of po
litical work ever exhibited in Califor*
nia. Bell made speechea-in support of
the measure as early as February 25,
but the soeeches were of ho* force or
effect In: the House. The amendment
which prevailed was introduced in th^
Senate, passed by the Senate and went
to the House, where it was concurred
in on April 20 as'a Senate amendment;
BELL'S RAW WORK.
United Statw Senator George C. Per- j
kins was amazed yesterday when he j
was shown a stenographic report of ;
Congressman Bell's speech at Wood- ;
land last Saturday night, wherein the
latter took unto himself sole credit
lor the Congressional legislation which
authorized the building of a collier at
Mare Island navy yard.
In order to get the exact language
of Bell in his talk on the tariff ques
tion, the Republican State Central
Committee engaged a stenographer to I
take down his words. The reference
to the collier occurs in the Woodland
speech. After citing page 2472 of the
Congressional Record Bell said: '
I felt it would be the proudest move of
my life If I- could obtain lor the people of
Vallejo and the people of this entire State
whit we had bo*n striving to obtain for the
pact twenty years â a modern steel veesel to be
constructed thereâ and after having obtained
tfcii through my own effort* I protest against
anjr man or any paper attempting to steal the
tr*Â£lt from some other man.
The record now in possession of The I
Call will show who is attempting to |
steal credit from another man.
To Senator Perkins it was frankly
paid: "Senator, Congressman Bell
claims the credit for the legislation
â¢which gave the building of a collier to
the navy yard at Vallejo. You know
the real facts. If the credit belongs
to Congressman Bell, The Call will
give it to him. Let us have the truth.
THE INSIDE TRUTH. .
"The facts are these," replied Sena
tor Perkins: "I obtained the Senate
amendments to the House bill author
izing the construction of the two col
liers at the navy yards â one on the
Atlantic and one on the Pacific Coast.
I went to the members of the House
Committee on Naval Appropriations. I
atked Foss, Dayton and Meyer to put
thr provision in the bill, but the com
mittee and the House failed to do so.
When the bill came to the Senate it
was referred to the Committee on Na
val Affairs. I am the second mem
ber of that committee. With the" as
sistance of Senator Martin of -Virginia
I got the amendment in. Senator Hale
of Maine was not inclined to favor it.
He cited the battleship Texas as an ex
ample of navy yard construction.
However the Senate amended the bill
and authorized the construction of two
colliers at the navy yards â one on the
Atlantic and one on the Pacific. The
bill went to the House, and the House
refused to concur in the Senate
amendment. A conference commit
tee over the disagreement was the re
sult. The Senators appointed to the
conference were: Hale of Maine, Per
kins of California. Martin of Virginia,
The Representatives were: Foss of Il
linois, Dayton of West Virginia, Meyer
of Louisiana.
"Personally I urged the members to
support the Senate amendments and
the conference committee reported iu
favor of retaining it. I .went to Repre
sentative Gillett and others, and asked
them to stand in and adopt the report
of the conference. Gillett was ready to
make every effort to secure adoption,
but the report was adopted without op
position. Look . at the Congressional
Record to verify my statements."
RECORD CLEAR.
The Congressional Record, Wednes
day. April 20, 1904, ;. page 5425, clearly
Eustains the position of Senator Per
kins. The indelible record is that the
Senate amendment which Senator Per-
Ulns introduced prevailed. Here is an
extract from the Congressional Record
in which the action of the House in re
ceding from its disagreement Is clearly
reported: - â¢
Mr. Daytonâ Mr. Speaker. I simply cat! et

At 10 o'clock this morning Judge
Sloss will decide the matter of the ap
plication of Louis Ferrari for a writ
of mandate compelling the Election
Commissioners to place his name on
the official ballot as candidate for jus
tice of the peace. He was nominated
fcy the Democratic convention: to fill
the office now held by Isidore Golden,
who was appointed by Governor Par
dee to fill the unexpired term of Percy
V. Long, j resigned. Ferrari argued
his own case yesterday and the Elec
tion Commissioners were represented
by Edmund Tauzsky. Mr. Tauzsky's
contention was that Golden was en
titled to the office until the next elec
tion for justice of the peace in 1906,
and he declared' that the charter pro
vision for a two-year term was not a
law â the office being a constitutional
one.
Ferrari's Case Submitted.
the Senate from the Seventeenth Dis
trict; Thomas F. Egan, J. N. Copas
and J. li. Cullen addressed the meet
ing. Mr. Livernash was enthusiastic
ally greeted and thanked the audi
ence for its demonstration of friend
ship. In part he said:
It cannot have escaped the attention of
thoughtful citizens that American manufac
turers who do business on a large scale are
bÂ«-coÂ«n!ne less and less heedful of the national
welfare. fnleps *ane check* are Interposed
by government I and by public opinion and
orjranlratlons aT>art from . gpvernment. our
children will inherit trom our generation con
d.tiuus of terrible cravity.
A few days ago a press dispatch from ntts
burg announced that the Carncgrie Steel Com
pany bad just Issued a circular letter to the
htads of Its various plants instructing them "to
employ no men over I!5 years of aje In cer
tain departments, and extending the age limit
to 40 in others," the latter affecting the skilled
artisans.
Now. the " action thus taken by the great
Carnegie Company is not peculiar to that con
cern. Similar action ha* been taken by scores
of other manufacturing: companies In this coun
try, and It is well known in the Industrial
world that the tendency In all large plants
Is toward elimination of workmen over 40 years
of are.
Will electors calmly reflect on this? Can
they be pleased by such a tendency? Is it
a symptom of a condition favorable to our na
tional lite? .
I have inquired with dilljente concerning:
tills tendency and I find that our great manu
facturing- plants regard men as they regard
machines â to be run to the breaking point as
long as they' can stand it. and then to be
sent to the scrap heap. High pressure is the
rule. Physical collapse of the workers under
that pressure is courted on by the employers.
It is figured on precisely the same basis as
the collapse of a boiler or a breakdown of a
cog-wheel in consequence of the limitations
of matter.
IVhat Is to be done with the men of middle
age end the old men forced out of' employ
ment at the trades they have mastered? There
ls a problem calling for the best thought of
earnest Americans regardless of party, regard,
l^erof class.
â¢ One of the features of the case was
the non-appearance of Mrs. Coit at the
trial. She testified at the nrellmtnary
hearing before Police Judge Fritz, but
almost immediately thereafter left the
city and went to Paris, France.
Alexander B. Garnett, convicted of
murder in the second degree by a jury
in Judge Lawlor"s court for shooting
and killing Major J. W. McClung in the
apartments of Mrs. Elizabeth W. Coit
in the Palace Hotel on November 25.
was sentenced yesterday to serve fif
teen years in San Quentin. He took
his sentence calmly,
j When the caae was called the Judge
denied the motion for a new trial and
also a motion for arrest of Judgment
made 'by Attorney George D. Collins.
The Judge in passing sentence referred
to the recommendation for mercy made
by the jury, but aaid that the defend
ant's invasion of Mrs. Coit'a apart
ments was an outrage upon her rights
and such acta must be denounced by
the courts. After reviewing the cir
cumstances of the case, the Judge said
he would deal with It asi if the defend
ant did not go to Mrs. Coifs apart
ments with a full-fledged purpose of
committing a felony. After sentence
waa pronounced, Attorney Collins filed
a notice of appeal to the Supreme
Court.
When Attorney Collins went to the
Judge and asked for a certificate of
probable cause the Judge said: "Why
don't you let Garnett go to San Quen
tin and after a year maybe something
can be done for him." Collins replied:
"Mr. Garnett is a Southern gentleman
and does not want to see the inside of a
penitentiary till he ls sent there by the
Supreme Court."
It was decided to aak the Civil Ser
vice Commission for a mechanic to care
for the voting machines and not to
press the application to the Supervisors
for allowance .of an all-round me
chanic, for which there Is no provision
in the Civil Service Department If the
mechanic does k not prove satisfactory
a request will then be made that the
Commissioners be permitted to make
their own selection. A suggestion from
Voorsanger that the Civil Service
Board be asked to hold an examina
tion for a machine t caretaker was not
taken up.

they are bona fide. He was authorized

Martin Kelly appeared at the Regis
trar's office yesterday and filed peti
tions purporting to have been signed
by members of the "Taxpayers' par
ty," asking that five nominees for the
Assembly and one for State Senator
be placed on the official ballot at the
next election. The nominees are as
follows:
Senator Shortridge showed that Con
gressman Bell's claim for credit for ob
taining appropriations for Napa Creek
and the Sacramento River were foun
dationless. The appropriations, said
Shortridge, were the results of Colonel
Heuer's recommendation.
Senator BelshawJn the Senate, and
stated that no man in the Legislature
of California had done more than he to
prevent ] the waste of the public's
money by. foolish and extravagant leg
islation.
"I often wonder what the people of
this country would do if they did not
have somebody to elect all the time.
We go from, one election to another
like cats from one fit to another. Now
we must elect a man to fill the'Pres
idency. It's a question between Judge
Parker and a man we have known for
years, Roosevelt., We had tariff for
revenue and . free trade under Cleve
land and it nearly bankrupted us. Now
our" Republican prosperity helps the
Democrats and ourselves alike. I don't
like that arrangement' and have been
trying for years to think up a remedy.
They say that tariff for revenue robs
no one, but from '93 to '97 it robbed
everybody and yet our Democratic
friends say it is a good. thing. You
will remember that from '93 to '97 were
long, hard years. Perhaps they were
not any longer, but, by George, -they
seemed longer; . ho when the people
had enough of. it. they, elected : that
great and good man, McKinley,' and
got . protection. In two years . we were
prosperousragain.,^ _-, .Â»-;â¢. ..,.,.,,_ : v ' .
g "Times never- were, better. -than now.
There were never' so. !mahy, full ( dinner
pails and so many full, savings ac
counts. Now, if I could, have my way
I would decide a man's. prosperity by
the ticket he votes. It would .be his
own fault then if he voted for Demo
cratic hard times and his reward if
he voted - for Republican prosperity.
There have been many loyal Democrats
who have fought for their, country, but
they - have that one forgivable sin
of being Democrats- One of them said
to me: 'I'm a Democrat and have to
vote. for Parker, but I hope Roosevelt
will get it.' '
Â¦ "They say Roosevelt is an unsafe man.
He is for grafters. They don't like
him because he shot a Spaniard in the
back, but where else could he shoot
him? They say. he is impetuous, but
we know of the quiet things he has ac
complished." â¢ .Â¦ , :
. Senator Ward of San Diego. was the
las.t speaker. ._. He", prophesied a great
victory. for the Roosevelt ticket.
Chairman C, M. Simpson ' introduced
Congressman McLachlan, who j was
made chairman of the meeting.' Mc-
Lachlan paid a glowing tribute to the
Iate;U. S. Bangham and W. S. Melick
and then gave way to Governor Par
dee, who received an ovation when he
took the platform.
"I stand here with mingled pride and
tears,", said the Governor. "Pride that
you are fellow citizens of "W. S. Me
lick, my late esteemed and loved fellow
public officer. There never was a man
who nestled so closely to my heart, who
served so well the people who confided
in him.
PASADENA, Oct. 18.â Governor Par
dee, Congressman James McLachlan
and Senator Ward of San Diego ad
dressed the biggest Republican rally
of the campaign here to-night. The
meeting' was preceded by a street
parade in which the police, the
Crown City Band, " the American
Club, the Colonial Club, "the Col
ored* Republican Club, the speakers
and prominent Republicans took part.
The parade lasted a half hour and dur
ing its progress the Shotgun Club flred
volley after volley and red fire galore
was burned. . The streets were throng

Lalini, the murderer, who was ar
rested last night at San Rafael, was
brought to this city Tuesday morning
by Sheriff Frank P. Grace. vThe weap
on with which the crime was commit
ted was found on his person. He ex
.presses no contrition for his murder
ous act, and when informed that one
of his victims had died merely shrug
ged his shoulders.
District Attorney C. H. Pond, who
took Rlcci's ante-mortem statement
Monday evening, is 1 convinced that
there is a woman at the bottom of the
case. Rlcci mentioned that Guidotti
had taken a woman from Parachi's
hotel at Glen Ellen to Sonoma Sun
day, and this is believed to have
aroused the jealousy of Lalini. Rlcci
says he was informed that Lalini had
threatened he would kill Guidotti be
fore night, and states that he was on
the lookout for the execution of the
threat. When Lalini undertook to
draw his gun Ricci sprang toward
him, and this caused him to fire two
shots at Rlcci after wounding Guidotti.
An inquest was held by > Coroner
Frank L. Blackburn this afternoon,
and Lalini was charged with "murder
by the jury. '

SHOOTING AT GLEX ELLEX
DUE TO MAX'S JEAIX>USY
j SANTA CRUZ", Oct. IS.â It became
j known here to-day that a movement is
i on foot to consolidate all the lighting
and power plants of Santa Cruz and
Watsonvllle. with the ultimate purpose
of merging ' them into a company,
which will include the lighting and
power companies and certain street
railways of San Jose. The first move
toward the accomplishment of this un
dertaking was made several weeks ago
when the electric street railways of
Santa Cruz were consolidated. The
same persons who were involved in this
scheme are reported to be the main
factors in the greater one now being
quietly carried out.
In the background is Manager Gran
ger of the newly organized street rail
way service and acting as his agent in
negotiations with the outside power
and lighting companies is J. W.
Forgues of Santa Cruz. The stockhold
ers of the different corporations have
already given an option on their stock
and it is reported that the deal will be
consummated through the medium of
a San Francisco trust company and a
law firm of that city within the next
thirty days. In the deal there are in
cluded the gas companies of Santa
Cruz, .as well as three electric lighting
companies.
From what can be learned from those
who are concerned in the deal it is the
intention of the absorbing company to
establish electric railway connection
between San Jose and Santa Cruz and
way points and eventually extend the
present lines from Santa Cruz to Mon
terey.' With thes connections effected
and with the extension of the San Ma
teo electric line to San Jose, which is
said to be under consideration by the
United Railroads of San Francisco, a
through electric line will soon be oper
ating between the San Francisco and
Monterey bays.
The promoters of the gigantic scheme
have held frequent meetings lately in
j Santa Cruz and San Francisco and are
eald to have already agreed on many
points relative to the expansion of the
traffic territory of the various lines
which are to be merged.
"Within two days the cattlemen gath
ered and after running the herders out
of the country destroyed the sheep
wagons and camps and slaughtered the
sheep. The herders were not injured.
The sheepmen know the leaders of the
raids and they will be prosecuted. The
raid was the culmination of a contro
versy between the sheep, and cattle in
terests of Ions standing. ..
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Oct. 18!â Sheep
and cattle men clashed on prays River,
near the Wind River forest reserve, a
few days ago, and nearly a thousand
sheep were driven over a cliff by the
cattle men and 'killed. The sheep had
trespassed on the forest reserve and
were driven off by the rangers only to
return again later. This time the
rangers drove the sheep into a cattle
country. ;''.', ;Â¦']. ,.,'Â¦ /
Special Dispatch to The Call.
While the Supreme Court is In â¢ Los
Angeles, the matter of its taking aetipn
to disbar Bernard Daniel O'Connell, an
attorney lately admitted to practice
in this State, is held in abeyance.
Â¦ It was a " Question yesterday as v to
whether Mr. O'Connell was the same
men as the Bernard Daniel O'Connell,
who was convicted in 1897 r of "incit
ing-, aiding and abetting an attempt at
bribery" in the State of Massachusetts
for which he was fined $500 and im
prisoned for six months. All doubts
whether "Daniel" O'Connell of this city
is identical with the Bernard D. O'Con
nell were removed yesterday, when a
personal friend, M. A. O'Connor, > a
timber land speculator, of 602 Com
mercial street, came forward and ap
peared very indignant Â¦ at what he
ttrmed the persecution of ; his friend.
He â¢ referred to \ Mr. O'Connell as a
briliiant man and a fine attorney and
ea'i'd .that he was the victim of political
animosity in the East. 4
. O'Connor said that O'Connell had
been ''railroaded to prison" by men
who were his political enemies, and
that one of the Justices of the Su
preme Court of Massachusetts was the
bitterest enemy O'Connell had. He
also said that the attack on O'Connell
was "mean and cowardly" inasmuch
as the letter to the clerk of the Su
preme Court here was unsigned.
Owing to the persecutions of his ene
mies in the East Mr. O'Connell came
out here, changed his name and en
deavored to start again. . -,--:.â¢
Mr. O'Connel^ graduated . f rom
Georgetown University and was first
admitted to practice in- the District of
Columbia. Later he removed to Mas
sachusetts, whiere he was admitted to
practice. Following his conviction he
was disbarred from practice by the
State of Massachusetts. Upon the com
pletion of his sentence last May he
came to. California. He brought with
him letters of introduction from
prominent people,' among them Con
gressman Sulzer of New York and Cor
poration Counsel J. J. Delaney and
recommendations from an influential
benevolent order.
O'Connell intends to remain here
permanently and is making arrange
ments in the East to bring out his
family.
Stephen Costello, -on whose motion
O'Connell was admitted to- practice in
California, said < yesterday that he
could take no action- until the Su
preme Court returned; 5 at which * time
he would" aak; f that O'Connell's admis
sion be~ canceled. " Should 'O'Connell
arrive here before the court returns It
is probable that he will hand in his
resignation arid return his license. The
fact that O'Connell did hot state that
he had been -disbarred â¢ by the Massa
chusetts Supreme Court would in it
self constitute sufficient reason for his
disbarment here. - # â¢ <

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and
Effectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long been
considered the next thing to incurable.
The usual symptoms are a full or bloat-
ing sensation after eating, accompanied
sometimes with sour or watery risings,
a formation of Rases, causing pressure
on the Jieari and lungs and Â¦ difficult
breathing, -headaches, fickle appetite,
nervousness and a' general played out,
languid feeling. '
' There-is often; a foul taate in the
mouth, coated tongue and if the interior
of the stomach could be seen it would
show a slimy. Inflamed condition.
The cure for Jhis common and ob-
Etlnate, trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and Irritate' the delicate
raucous surfaces of the stomach. To
secure a prompt and healthy, digestion
is the: oncnecessary thing to do and
when normal, digestion is secured the
catarrhal condition will have disap-
peared.
According to Dr. Harlanson the saf-
est and best treatment is to use after
each meal a tablet composed of Dias-
tase, Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux, Gold-
en Seal and fruit acids. These table'ts
can now bo found at all . drug stores
under the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets/ and not being a patent medi-
cine can be used , with perfect safety
and assurance that healthy appetite
and thorough digestion, will follow their
regular use after, meals.
- Mr./ R. , S. Workman, Chicago, 111.,
writes: "Catarrh is a local condition
resulting from a. neglected cold in. the
head, -whereby' Â¦ the lining membrane
of the nose becomes - inflamed and i the
poisonous ! discharge * therefrom passing
backward Into the throat reaches -the
stomach," this I producing catarrh of the
stomach. Medical authorities prescrib-
ed tor. me for three r years , f or - catarrh
of stomach without cure,; but to-day

A second divorce action between the
Barries Is now pending in the Supe
rior Court of the county. It, was
brought by Mr. Barrie as a sequel to
his wife's suit for divorce, which re
sulted in the woman's discomfiture in
court, Â¦ when she failed to obtain the
coveted decree.
Mrs. Barrie startled the community
a year ago by declaring that her hus
band and his nephew, Edwin Wade,
had -"railroaded" her to an insane asy
lum because she objected strenuously
to the alleged improper actions of
Barrie in the home. Mrs. Barrie re
sented the presence of Margaret
Wade, a niece, in her home and swore
that the husband's actions made the
place unfit for a residence for herself
and her young daughter.
Judge Ogden of Oakland heard the
sensational story she had to tell. In
timated his belief that she was not
perfectly sound mentally and denied
her a decree.
Barrie then sued for divorce, alleg
ing cruelty. His wife retorted with a
cross-complaint on statutory grounds,
to which he entered a denial to-day In
the Superior Court while his wife was
suing him in the Justice's Court of
Berkeley. Vr v.*> 'Â¦>
An echo of the sensational Barrie
divorce suit, was heard .to-day, when
Mrs. Eliza Barrie filed suit in Justice
Edgar's court "to recover silverware
worth $299. now in the possession of
Margaret Wade, Edwin Wade and
Alexander Barrie. The three persons
named are made defendants in Mrs.
Barrie's action. All of them were In
volved by Mrs. Barrie in her weird ac
cusations against Barrie, when she
sued him for divorce a year ago. They
are now presumed to reside at the
Barrie home. 2601 Fulton street,
where is kept the silverware she
seeks to recover, claiming that it is

"I love the great State of California,"
said the speaker, "and shall welcome
the opportunity to do something for her
in Congress, never forgetting, the re
sponsibilities that must devolve upon
the man who' sits as successor to those
distinguished Calif ornians. Judge Me-
Kenna and -Secretary Metcalf." ; ..
>'E. Myron Wolf entertained the audi
ence for an hour with a witty, logical
and applause compelling address, deal
ing; with national issues. He defended
the President from charges that he has
usurped the functions of Congress, ex
plained the Panama canal incident, ex
coriated David Bennett Hill, whom he
declared to be "the man behind the
gun" in Judge Parker's cause, and
contrasted the sane, safe policy of the
Republican party with that of the
Democracy, which party he declared
to be unworthy of the suffrages of
American voters.
Senator Lukens was introduced as
one who had graduated from the State
University and who at Sacramento
had done very much to advance the
university. In his brief address Sen
ator Lukens referred to the magnifi
cent results achieved by the univer
sity,, saying that he took especial
pleasure in helping to further the In
terests of the great university for
which he cherished much admiration
and respect. He described the vigi
lance and efficiency of Assemblyman
Waste and Senator Knowland and
commended .them to the people.
Senator Knowland followed, declar
ing his belief that the university Is the
State's best investment. He than
touched upon his candidacy for Con
gress. His declaration made a few
weeks ago that if elected he would
deem himself fortunate in being able to
count upon- the advice and assistance
of Hon. Victor H. Metcalf, having been
criticised by his opponent. Candidate
McPlke, Senator Knowland reaffirmed
It, saying further that if he eVer got to
a point where he ceased to feel the
need of older, and more experienced
men's advice,' he hoped to be relegated
to private life. Â¦ * ?l
"To those who say that this cam
paign is an apathetic affair I wish to
commend â¢ this audience, its size and
enthusiasm, as proof that they do not
know whereof they speak."
" Thus spoke Assemblyman W. H.
Waste, chairman of the Republican
rally held to-night in Shattuck Hall,
as he opened the meeting. The hall
was packed to overflowing with scores
standing on .both floors. There were
cheers for Chairman Waste, Senator G.
Ri Lukens and Senator J. R. Know
land, .Republican .nominee for Con
gress in the Third District, and ap
plause in plenty for E. Myron Wolf,
the principal -speaker.

Both sides finished their direct testi
mony to-day. Sheahan says that spirits
have caused the difficulty between him
self and his wife and she says it's the
rnore material, * good right hand of her
husband,' whom she accuses of striking
her upon -any provocation. ,- He
that they never quarreled during; their
married life until about, a year ago and
then it was because she became a spir
itualistic medium and attempted to
turn their home into a resort for be
lievers of her kind. .
J. R. Van Anden, her brother, a
youth about 16 years of age, was on the
stand at the time the Interruption oc
curred.
He had testified that he had seen
Sheahan strike his wife and said that
It was^while they were living on Lin
den avenue In San Francisco. Van An
den was an Inmate at St. Vincent's Or
phan Asylum, near San Rafael, for sev
eral years and Attorney Cochrane, who
was cross-examining him, asked: Â¦
"When did you go to St. Vincent's
Home?"
"Tell him it's none of his business,"
shrieked the sister from her seat In the
courtroom.
Kicking and. struggling in the arms
of two big deputy sheriffs. Mrs. Mabel
C. Sheahan was forcibly, carried from
courtroom to County Jail this afternoon
to serve out a two days' sentence for
contempt of court. This was the cli
max to a number of scenes created by,
the woman during the trial of her di
vorce case against John J. Sheahan. a
Sail. Francisco insurance adjuster. She
hag interrupted the proceedings upon
many occasions during the past few
days and this afternoon, from her seat
in the. rear of the room, she told her
brother, who was testifying, not to an
swer certain questions.
Judge Melvin immediately ordered
the woman into the custody of the
Sheriff. She ran out of the courtroom
and when she saw the deputies after
her she told them to keep away. Dep
uties Sweeney' and Simons seized her
and she sat- down on the floor and
compelled them to carry her down -the
stairs to the Sheriff's office. She made
matters as for them as she
could by kicking, but her struggles
were of no avail. Later Judge Melvin
made an order, sending her to jail for
two days and she was carried to the
County Jail, where she will be allowed
to cool- off. . . . -

No part of the $30,000 worth' of costly
volumes that are now the subject of a
suit against the estate of the late Jose
phine Dunsmuir was produced in court
to-day, notwithstanding the demand
made by Attorney A. A. Moore on be
half of E. Holdaway, publisher. The
nearest disclosure of their identity was
the production of a copy of a bill to
the amount of $15,192. \i tv ';t
The prices charged would have made
the old authors princes among capital
ists had they had their share in the
profits from their work. Sir Walter
Scott, laboring to pay off his creditors,'
could hardly have wished' for a richer
mine than to have seen a magnificent
set of his works bring $1920. But this
was only an item. Ten volumes of the
great operas are listed at $1500. Shakes
peare in his struggling days would
never have believed that a set of his
works would have sold for $1000. For
thirty-two volumes ' of Dickens the
bibliophile Is charged $1280; four vol
umes of Schiller, $140; eighteen volumes
of Carlyle, $360; thirty-three volumes
of the Anthology, $1320. and some vol
umes on Japan, with scenes, $750.
Holdaway to-day swore that all these
works were . sets of limited editions,
many of which cannot be duplicated.
They are bound in the best leather: and
have Mrs. Dunsmuir's monogram on
the covers. this reason, he says,
he would be unable to sell them.

The origin of the present trouble
dates back nearly two years to a fight
between Blackman and a man named
Lane over the lease of a piece of prop
erty in Fruitvale, which was used by
Blackman as a wood and coal yard.
Lane, who owned the proper ty, or
dered Blackman to vacate.^ and when
he went for the keys a flgh't followed,
in which Lane was worsted. He then
had Blackman arrested on a charge of
assault with a deadly weapon, alleg
ing that the latttr had struck him
with an iron bar. Blackman was af
terward acquitted.
A number of the residents of Fruit
vale took sides in the row and the
feud has been intermittently carried on
ever since. ,;.%^^>^ir->.- ; ;.r
A feud of nearly two years* standing
among some of the residents of Fruit
vale, which has severa.1 times resulted
In arrests and battles in ( court, has
again broken out with renewed vio
lence. Already three men have been
arrested on charges of disturbing the
peace, and warrants are out for two
more, who are wanted on the same
charge. The complaints are all sworn
to by Colonel Frank Lynch, editor and
proprietor of the Fruitvale News, who
charges the men with having made
threats against his life.
The men arrested this, afternoon
are: E. L. Blackman, Eugene Dean
and Carl Hartwick. Constable Mor
ris Lane is now searching for the other
two. C. Stickney and Michael Carroll.
Lynch says that last night the five
men named came to the Satro Park
Hotel and after calling him to the
door, abused him in violent terms and
ended by exhibiting revolvers and
threatening his ilfe. He also alleges
that for nearly two hours this after
noon Hartwick paraded op and down
in front of the hotel with a double
barreled shotgun on his shoulder and
dared the proprietor to come out.
Lynch, however, believed discretion to
be the better part of valor and re
tnained inside.

It was nothing more than a mangy,
vagrant yellow cur that had been
"shooed", off the front steps that caus
ed all of the troubled The Sears, Hen
dricksen and Norwood families are
neighbors, at 615 and 619 Tenth street.
Just as Mrs. -Norwood was chasing the
dog from the porch, Mrs. Sears hap
pened along in time to see the incident
and immediately imagined the dog had
been "sicked" upon her. Ben Sears, a
waiter and the head of the Sears
household, took I* M. Norwood, Mrs.
Norwood's husband, to task. The men
went at it hammer and tonga, Norwood
being bested.
Mrs. Mary Hendrlcksen, in the role
of peacemaker, . intervened, . but, as
usual, came oft badly. Sears disposed
of her with a blow on the face, - - ;
Norwood and Mrs. Hendricksea
caused Sears* arrest. He was' tried'be
fore Police Judge George Samuels to
day and found guilty.
During the trial it appeared that Mrs.
Hendricksen's husband had witnessed
the attack on his wife and had not
moved to the defense. â¢Â¦' i -* > r ' :
'Â¦Why didn't he take a hand?" la
quired Attorney A. L. Frick for Sears.
"Is he an invalid?" added the law
yer. , ;
"No. he ten't; he's a good Christian."
replied Mrs. Hendricksen, indignantly.
Sears will appear Monday for sen
tence.

Little Brown Men Enjoy Play Where

.Russians.
Like a melodrama of the American
Civil War was the Japanese play,
"Ainoko" â "The Hal fbreed"â presented
at Union Square Hall last night. Only
there were Japanese instead of North
erners. Bearded Russians', or rather
the Japanese conception of the bearded
Russian, stood In lieu of Southerners.
Whoever" says that the Japanese are
an unemotional; race shouiu have been
at that play last night. When an army
of three Japanese charged through an
army of seven Russians and performed
feats of jui jltsu upon the Slavs, while
the bombs were bursting in air, the
gallery was as excited as the Central
Theater on, "aturday night There is
a plot in the thing that might give
some American â¢ concocters of . melo
drama valuable material. .The play
was given to raise funds for the wid
ows and orphans of soldiers killed in
battle. , -1 .. .
Thy tale is of a Japanese half breed,
whose father is a Russian: named Dro

one of the besieged at Port .'Arthur,
while- the son is with Â¦ tha, Japanese
army outside., .The father" escapes, dis

him cruelly. A colonel of the Japs
rescues him and turns him over to the

JAPANESE PRESENT DRAMA
OF CONFLICT IN THE EAST
Deputy Health Officer Levy received
notification yesterday that the Attor
ney General of California had rendered
an opinion that osteopaths are not en
titled/ under; the law to sign- death cer
tificates. The act of the j Legislature
permitting osteopaths to practice does
not carry with it their recognition as
duly licensed physicians, the Attorney
General says.
May Not Sign Death Certificates.
The members of the Institute, while
agreeing with the city's .adornment
committee that the old pavilion is rap
idly passing beyond its days 'of use
fulness, have announced that they are
not financially prepared to build a
modern structure on the pavilion site.
In view of this fact it has been sug
gested by the adornment committee
that possibly a corporation may be
formed to purchase the site and erect
upon it a handsome new building. The
representatives of the institute have
assured the promoters of the auditor
ium project that their organization
will consider any reasonable proposi
tion to sell the site, especially to any
corporation representing the city's In
terests.
The replacing of the old Mechanics'
Pavilion with a handsome, K modern
auditorium, one that would be an or
nament to the city and afford ample
accommodations for big conventions,
is not beyond the range of possibility.
The members of the Society for the
Adornment and Improvement of San
Francisco have been in conference
with representatives of the Mechanics'
Institute with a view of learning just
what action that organization would
take In the event of an auditorium be
ing projected. "v"~

The police ascertained -". yesterday
that Ernest N. Bales is not a benefi
ciary in the will of Mrs. Annie Engel
berg, whom he is alleged to have ac
cidentally shot last Thursday night.
Mrs. Engelberg willed ( most of her
possessions to a cousin in Gilroy. This
discovery leads the police to believe
that Bales is innocent of any crime,
and unless the Coroner's jury holds
him, he will be dismissed from cus
tody. N

A. O. Hess, who claims to be a
clergyman from Portland,* related to
the police yesterday "a weird tale of
being held up by a masked man at-
Montgomery avenue and Pacific street
shortly after midnight yesterday
morning and robbed of $200
and a ' â¢ watch. - He sa^d he
was seeing the sights with a friend
whom he met on the street and' that
the latter left him a minute before the
masked man appeared.
A dispatch from Portland says that
â¢He^s had a J similar experience there
some time ago, but his story was re
ceived with some doubt. However, he
gained much sympathy and received
financial aid at the time. Hess prom
ised to come to Captain Burnett's of
fice at 7:30 last night and aid the de-'
tectives, in' capturing the alleged rob
ber. He called, but told Captain Bur
nett that "he had secured a job- with
the Santa Fe railroad and decided to
let the matter drop.

The California delegation to the
congress will probably confer at St.
Louis and mari out a line of policy, to
be pursued in harmony with the in
terests of California. Among the
speakers who are to address the con
gress are , John Hays Hammond,
James R. Garfleld of the Department
of Commerce and Labor, Charles Je
rome Bonaparte, president of the Na
tional Municipal Reform Association;
F. H. Newell, chief of the reclamation
service of the Department of the In
terior; Gifford Pinchot of the Bureau
of Forestry of the United States; F.
J. Hagenbarth, president of the Amer
ican Live-Stock Association: Martin
Dodge, director of road inquiries, and
Alexander H. Revell, vice president of
the National Business League. The
last named will discuss the question
of having the President of the United
States elected for one term only. Pres
ident Diaz of Mexico may attend the
congress.
Advance information has been re
ceived concerning some of the topics
that will be treated by Individual
speakers. The general committee
work and the.determination of poli
cies for the congress to adopt will en
gage the attention of . the delegates
more than the set speeches. *
Among the : accomplishments that
are claimed for the Trans-Mississippi
Congress, are the irrigation act; the
creation of a department of com
merce; securing deqp water at Gal
veston, Houston and New Orleans;
the construction of irrigation canals
and reservoirs and the successful ad
vocacy of other public measures of
different sorts.
: H. D. Loveland, vice president for
California for the Trans-Mississippi
Commercial Congress, started for the
East last evening to attend the con
gress, which will convene at St. Louis
next Tuesday and remain in sesisonflve
days. The other members of the Cal
ifornia delegation are somewhat scat
tered. Several are in St. Louis at
tending the St Louis Exposition, and
this fact, led to their appointment, In
suring a full attendance for California
at the deliberations that will take
place relating to large interests and
affairs . west of the Mississippi River.
A man was kept at the pump all
the time, _and all went passably well
until the t schooner got to the longitude
of the Hawaiian Islands, when the
wind grew shifty and squally. Then the
wind and seas came from all direc
tions. From every point of the com
pass came a yelling blast of gale with
a swell that tried to lick the clouds
out of the sky. More water spouted
through the opening seams, and more
muscle was put at the pump. The
vessel labored fearfully, and' on the
crest of some great sea it was feared
she would split in halves. The pump
choked up and the captain opened the
main ha^tch and got down among .the
cargo and cleared the pipe. After
ward the crew took the pump out of
its place, put it down the main hatch
and succeeded in keeping the water at
a safe level. / "^
A shift of men went into the hold
and boarded up the cargo so it would
not shift. Had the schooner gone on
her beam ends she . could not have
been righted. The skipper tried to
make one of the Hawaiian Islands,
but the wind shifted andjfcie, was
forced to set a course for San Fran-,
clsco. Head winds were encountered
during the voyage here. ,
So. fathom by . fathom, .- with the
crazy pump marking oft the slow
knots, the Karl and Ella weathered
the storm, and Skipper Beguhl Is here.
The vessel is now leaking, at her an
chorage and the pump is still working
to keep the water. down. < .
The log of the schooner is not writ
ten very plainly. Captain . Beguhl ex
plains that he was too worn out try
ing to keep afloat and keep himself
and the eight islanders above the
sharks to turn to literature. However,
the record of grit and endeavor is
there. It says the vessel left Ponape,
Caroline Islands, Aug'ust 17, with a
cargo of 85,800 pounds of copra, 223
pearl shells 250 pounds of ivory
nuts consigned to I. E. Thayer, San
Francisco. The vessel was in need
of repairs and leaked considerably,
and a strong southwest wind kicked
up a heavy sea and made matters
worse. To shorten the way the cap
tain cut through the Marshall and Bi
kini islands, and the continued gale
and high seas opened the seams of
the old hull more, and the ocean slip
ped in at every thump of the wave.
When the skipper could have put
on the canvas and sped harborward
he did not dare do so, as the increased
motion over the swells would be too
much for a pump such as was used in"
the ships of Tyre. Then the rigging
carried away, "first on one side and
then the other," says the log, "with
only one sailor to help on repairs."
Stoppers were put on, and with block
and tackle the broken swifters were
hauled taut. . The chain-plate bolts
drew out, but the rigging was fastened
to the fails, and the pump and the
schooner went merrily on.
The weather moderating the'eaptain
and such of his men who could work
got at some of the leaks and stuffed
them with canvas. Then the # flght
between the pump and the Â» Pacific
slackened up, and the log says the
schooner made less water.-
PUMPS KEPT GOING.
The story of a., well-fought battle
with wind and wave is written in the
log of"'the little schooner Karl and
Ella, Captain Beguhl, just in from the
South Pacific. With an = almost
useless pump, leaking ship, an
ignorant, timid, native crew, against
ceaseless gales and rolling seas,
the sturdy skipper worked his
water-logged craft up the lati
tudes. . He took passage through the
coral groups, running under short sail
to keeD Ms schooner from laboring
over the swells and splitting wide
open, and then this follower of the
Vikings of the north kept on, dropping
the knots behind him â and he is here.
His vessel, as she now lies at an
chor in the harbor, is leakins many
gallons every hour, and a tattooed de
scendant of some long-forgotten can
nibal is dragging the * crazy pump
liandle up and down, up and down, as
it has been going for weeks,- never los
ing a stroke night or day.
There are two feet of water in the
hold, and the Caroline Islander, bend
ing his brown back over the pump
brake, can't make it any less.
LOG OF THE VESSEL.
Policeman T. J. Kavanaugh and Spe
cial Officer, Berge were close by at the
time. They arrested the woman and
sent the wounded Japanese to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital. ..The bullet
had 'struck the unfortunate' Japanese
on the right temple rendering him un
conscious.
Mrs. Forsyth said that when she
raised the rifle to her shoulder some
one spoke from behind to her and she
wheeled around. To her surprise the
rifle was discharged. ' She thought her
cape got caught in the trigger. Max
Schwartz was an eye witness and he
declares that Mrs. Forsyth deliberately
turned/ around, pointed the rifle at the
Japanese and flred. ..
Detective Coleman has been detailed
on the case. He found that Mrs. For
syth wae living in a hovel in the base
ment of 2410 Jones street and that her
record for sobriety is not good. He
was informed that she has a husband
who works in the sugar refinery, but
Policeman George Collins, who knew
her family in Oakland, said that her
husband, Edward Forsyth, captain of
a coasting schooner, was washed over
board and drowned while at 'i sea, some
years ago. " -
Mrs. Forsyth was under the, influence
of liquor when she entered the shooting
gallery between 11 and 12 o clock yes
terday morning. She paid Noda ten
cents and he handed her a 22-caliber
rifle, which he had loaded. The woman
raised the rifle to her â¢ shoulder and
swung' around. Just then the rifle was
discharged and the Japanese dropped
to the floor with a groan.
The body of Am Xofia, proprietor of
a shooting gallery at 815 Kearny street,
lies on a slab at the Morgue. Mrs. Flor
ence Forsyth, 2410 Jones street, occu
pies a cell at the Hall of Justice and
to-day she probably will be formally
charged with his murder. The' Jap
anese was shot through the vbrain yes
terday morning by a bullet from one of
his own target rifles, which he had
just handed to the woman. He died
at the Central Emergency Hospital at
1:15 o'clock this morning.
Mrs. Forsyth claims the shooting was
accidental, but an eye-witness of the
tragedy declares she turned around and
aimed deliberately at Noda.

"Why do Ifcel used up and all nm"down;moat;
of the time?" _ . - .
How many ask themselves this question'dailyf.
The answer issimple. It is lack of nerve force.'
Science with its unerring, methods of research
has proved that the various organs and tissues of
the body continue in health and perform their,
work properly as long as their nerve supply re-
tains its vigor and strength. But if the nerves
degenerate or lose power from poor nourishment
or any other cause, the entire physiological mech-
anism of the body is thrown out of gear and we
have as a result some pronounced "rundown
condition or disease Â£v.-'."' :/;-Â».
The heart, the stomacn, the liver, all have their,,
great nerve centres which supply them with the
power to work properly. When these nerve cen-
tres are weakened theseimportantorganscannot : â¢
.act properly.

Celery Compound cured ma of chronic bil-
iousness of many years' duration. .1 was all
run down and I thought I never could feel
better, I had tried so many remedies with-
out success. It affords me pleasure to
state, however, that four bottles of the Com-

now feel better than I have in years.. I will
always heartily recommend Paine's Celery
Compound to all suffering from derange-^
ment of stomach and liver."â ChM. B*
Stacy, 450 Fifth Ave.
Prof. Edward E. Phelps, the famous'discoveret
of Paine's Celery Compound, was the first physi-
cian to openly declare twenty years ago that the
health of the human body depends entirely, upon
the health of the nerves.
Paine's Celery Compound " furnishes food for
the nerves themselves, and, while gently stimu-
lating them, restores them to their * original
â¢ strength and vigor and at once all the organs of
the body_take up. their^work and health is . reV
stored.' * -. "
Paine's Celery Compound sends new life throb-
bing through every artery and gives that glorious
feeling of perfect health.
For the past 17 years this great nerve vitalizef
and tonic has been the most universally used pre^;
â¢scription in the world Pale, sickly children/
weary women, broken-down, discouraged men
find strength and in .this, great, pre-
scription. _ t >;-"
It cures"disease*by removing the cause. When x
ever you suffer from rheumatism, headache,'
sleeplessness, dyspepsia, nervousness or "run-
down" condition you can be cured by Paine's
Celery Compound* Its .effect, is almost . immedP
ate.
Remember this. â Paine's Celery'Compound'is
the prescription of one of the most famous phys-
icians this country has ever known, and all reput?

THE Colusa Sun takes exception to a recent editorial in The
Call in which an effort was made to show the relation between
protection and prosperity.
The Sun says: "We are absolutely astounded that The Call
should admit to its columns such an article. A falsehood, known to
be a falsehood by every man, woman and child in the country, cer
tainly can do nobody any good."
That is rather severe talk. We were not aware that the cam
paign in Colusa had reached such a warm stage. But we are not
dismayed, for, turning to another page of the same issue of the Sun,
we find well-written editorial correspondence, sent en route to the
St. Louis Exposition, under the, caption, "Wealth-making Sugar
Beets," and using the town of Grand Island, Nebr., as its illustra
tion as follows:
"Grand Island, Nebr., is reached and the great four-story stone
and brick buildings are a sight on these plains â a city, a place of
business, all in the center of the sugar beet district. Great wagons
filled with cleanly washed beets are seen on the wagon roads and
lining up at the reception bins of the immense factory. The beets are
tender and white. The quantity is amazing. The busy highways
are filled. As far as the ranging eye can reach little clumps of trees
show where are situated farmhouses and, distances being decreased,
they grow larger and larger as we, pass by them. Herds of cattle,
fat and in great numbers, are seen in all directions. Creameries here
spring up and large hog farms have resulted. The beet here does
not yield so high a percentage of sugar as in California", but being
managed well here, made money kings of those who hold the stock.
The banks are in fine buildings and their business is enormous. The
streets looked like show days, and energy marked the gait of all.
Fine horses were a feature all the way from Grand Island to Colum
bus. Train after train of beets were passing in for miles. The roads
were wet from a recent rain and hauling by wagon was slower than
usual, we were told. The land is not so good as our river land, but
the yield has been sufficient to make a very rich community, where
only a few years ago Indian corn often was burned for fuel, or was
the food of grasshoppers. Beets never fail and they have not had the
grasshopper epidemic that so often followed up "the young grain
crops."
That is a true picture. But not a beet_ would have been planted
nor a sugar mill built at Grand Island had not Republican protection
fostered the industry. The Call is ready to go to a jury and -will
accept the Colusa Sun as a juror.

, All his public addresses on this sub
ject were characterized by a high re
spect for womanhood. In a speech de
livered at Amherst, Mass., the late
Senator said:
'I believe that the republic will
never reach the lofty ideal of the con
ception of our fathers; it will never
attain the high moral quality, which
will be alike its strength and its
safety, until that qualification shall be
given to it by the help and co-opera
tion of woman.
From his 'first appearance in pub
lic life the late United States Senator
Hoar of Massachusetts had been an
earnest upholder of all kinds of legis
lation for the benefit of women and
had been instrumental in the passage
of many laws which have given to
them better opportunities of education
and wage-earning, and above all he
had been a fearless champion of the
political rights of women.
A strong attachment existed between
him and his estimable wife. When
Mrs. Hoar died last winter, his friends
predicted that he would not long sur
vive her. His long advocacy of equal
rights for women was doubtless made
more earnest by his association with
this noble woman.

The striking novelty in picture post
cards is about to be placed on the
market by a French syndicate.
To an ordinary pictorial card is af
fixed a very thin transparent gelatine
disk, on which is impressed a~gramo
phone musical record. A hole is
'pierced through the center of the disk,
and the post card can be placed on
an ordinary "talking machine", and
played in the usual way. ,
The musical post card opens up an
entirely new. field for the craze. Photo
graphs of great singers and composers
will be accompanied by extracts from
their, works, pictures of national flags
by the anthems of the different coun
tries, and so on in variety.
Candidates for political honors, instead
of sending merely their photographs
to constituents, will be able to accom
pany them with the phonographic rec

It is the odium of party government that in all parties are men
seeking personal success by illicit use of the franchise. They are
callous to every sentiment except the desire to win personal ad :
vantage, though they wreck the law and defy its injunctions. It
was this spirit possessed by just such people that made the ballot
box a refuge of fraud and the city government an association of
criminals, preceding the Vigilance Committee. That body found such
a situation as made a legal purification impossible. The virus had
penetrated every part of public administration, so that a resort to
law was merely the putting of criminals on trial before themselves.
The committee was compelled to supersede the official administra
tion of the law, and when its work was finished it performed a work
of purgation that was long remembered, and the city was fairly clean,
and in its judiciary has remained so ever since.
The Merchants' Association is doing the same work that the
committee did, but not under the necessity of employing the same
means. Largely owing to its efforts, Grand Juries are more mindful
of their duty, and the material composing them is drawn from the
law abiding community. The courts are no longer under bondage
to the corrupters of the ballot and the law is safe in the hands of
our local bench. . It is no longer necessary to supersede officers
elected by ballot frauds, nor to hang murderers by irregular trial
after they have sought to terrorize the town by shooting down citi
zens who protest against public crime. So, while present corruption
is to be deplored, its correction is entirely possible by invoking the
law.
The individual citizen seldom cares to incur the risk of initiating
prosecutions and feels the need of such organized support as the as
sociation is able to give. We believe, however, that Mr. Fairfax
Wheelan has the courage to have gone on single-handed in pursuit of
the criminals, but we doubt if single-handed he could have succeeded
in his righteous purpose. To continue the work he began required
the many-eyed and many-handed" vigilance and the wide and disin
terested work of an organization. All this is furnished by the asso
ciation.
Already both the need and the success of that' work are ap
parent, in the sure prospect that at the coming election offenses
against the franchise will be reduced to a minimum. The willing
ness of leading business men and citizens like Mr. de Young and
Mr. Phelan to serve on election boards is one of the effects of the
association's work. But it must be remembered that the people will
not be deceived into a relaxation of watchfulness by the appointment
of a few such men on a few of the many election boards in the city,
while men who will wink at crime are put upon enough boards to
defeat the expression of the people's will. All election officers must
be above suspicion and then the result will be freed from all doubt
cf being a correct expression of the lawful voters of the city.
THE prosecution of ballot stuffers at the primary, undertaken by
Mr. Fairfax Wheelan, and supported by the Merchants' As
. sociation, has already uncovered a mass of official connivance
in, or indifference to, the vilest crimes against the franchise. The
association has gone far enough to make it imperatively necessary
that the Grand Tui^ and the courts, the police and all officers charged
with the enforcement of the. law, shall act with promptness and vigi
lance in pursuing the wrongdoers to punishment.
The vices that have been disclosed here are common to all large
cities, where there are reckless persons who are without conscience or
morality in matters of public concern, willing to lend themselves to
the schemes of equally immoral politicians. The only difference be
tween San Francisco and other cities is that here we have in
the Merchants' Association a voluntary organization that has the
collective courage and the resources to hunt down the offenders.

The California Promotion Commit
tee has the names of 100.000 on its
correspondence files, and it is found
that, although" an unusually large
number of these persons have come in
during the colonist rate, yet the num
ber who come to this State when the
rate is not In force is almost as
large.
The California Promotion Commit
tee has received a letter from James
V. Conner, secretary 5 of the Philadel
phia Printing Pressmen's Union, in
which he acknowledges the offer of
the committee to furnish free litera
ture to all who expect to attend the
convention of the International Print
ing Pressmen's and Assistants'. Union
in California in 1905. Many members
will make a long stay in this State,
and thev desire all the advance in
formation that they can secure. This
the committee will supply.
The California Promotion Commit
tee reports that there has been an
unusual rush of colonists to California
between September 15 and October 15
by the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe
routes. The last trainloads of- colonists
to leave on trie one-way route for,Cali
fornia are now en route, the rate hav
ing expired last Saturday.
The total " number of persons" who
came over the Southern Pacific in a
period of three weeks was 14,856, and
it is believed that at least 5000 more
will have a'rrived before the last train
bringing settlers comes into Califor
nia, and probably this number will be
swelled to 7000 or 8000. The Santa
Fe also reports an unusual heavy
traffic, and the number which have
gone over that line will probably Bwell
the total number of colonists for the
thirty days from September 15 to Oc
tober 15 close to" 30,000; or at the rate
of 1000 per day. . - '-.
Last year the time in which the
colonist rates were in force lasted
from September 15 to November 30,
but from present indications there is
every reason to believe that new set
tlers will be coming in. despite the
withdrawal of the colonist rate.
More Than 14,000 Newcomers Enter
State to Stay in Period of

The golden Jubilee of the Sisters of the
Presentation Order of California was
observed yesterday with beautiful re
ligious and musical, services at St.
Francis Church. The imposing build
ing was decorated in golden silk and a
wealth of chrysanthemums and the al
tars were illuminated.
The main body of the church' was
filled with Sisters of the Presentation
Order, Dominican Order, Sisters of
Charity, Sisters of the Holy Names and i
Sisters of the Holy Family, the latter i
having taken charge of the decorations.
Within the sanctuary were Archbish- |
op RIordan, attended by the Rev. ;
Father Cummins, chancellor, and the \
Rev. Father Mulligan, pastor of St. '
Joseph's Church, as deacons of honor.
The Rev. Father T. Caraher. pastor of \
St. Francis, was celebrant of the sol- j
emn high mass, assisted by the Rev.
Father Piperni, deacon, and the Rev.
Father Kiley, subdeacon. The Rev.
Father McGough was master of cere
monies.
The Rev. Father Philip O'Ryan de
livered an impressive sermon In which
he said:
It is fitting that on the occasion of the fif
tieth anniversary of the coming of the Pre
â¢entatlon Sisters to California we should give
thanks to the giver of all good glfta for the
blessings with which he has enriched their
efforts and the great things he has vouch
safed to do through them.
Fifty years ago to-day five humble nunÂ» set
foot In this new city. Far from their own
land and from their friends, what hope had
they of laying the foundations, and building
great institutions? But the secret of their
strength was their trust In God, and that
trust was not misplaced; for lo! the mission
was a success from the beginning.
GREAT SCHOOLS ARISE.
Two great schools of learning arose in a
few years and pupils by thÂ« thousand flocked
to their halls. Generation after generation
of young women went forth from their schools
with the light of faith upon their eyeÂ» and
the seal of virtue stamped upon their souls.
Generation Â¦ i after generation went forth to
sanctify their own homes, to be the Ideal
Christian matrons. Who can tell how far
reaching has been the influence of this great
â¢Uent work for fifty golden years?
Father O'Ryan then traced the his
tory of the Presentation Order. It was
founded during the penal age in Ire
land by a great woman, Nanb Nagle,
for the Christian education of youth.
Nano Nagle, he said, was the pioneer
of popular education among English
speaking people.
When the call came from San Fran
cisco for teaching nuns, five Presenta
tion Bisters responded. One fell sick
and her place was filled by Mother
Mary Teresa Comerford, who was des
tined to be the leader of the order on ;
this coast.
The struggles and sacrifices of the
Eisters were* # described by Father
O'Ryan. Generous Catholic gentlemen,
he said, came to their assistance and
within two years after their arrival the
great school on. Powell street was open
ed. This was followed , by the "building
of the Presentation School on Taylor
street. Â¦
ARCHBISHOP CONGRATULATES.
Archbishop Riordan referred to the
high encomiums given the Presenta
tion Sisters by Father O'Ryan for
their great and untiring work and de
votion, which, he said, had achieved
so much for this city.
It was but a small and poor city
when the Sisters came here, but since
then that band of noble women had
educated many thousands of children,
trained them in the work of life, and,
said his Grace, all this labor had been
done silently and unostentatiously.
The good nuns had received scarcely
any help, but had relied upon their
own efforts.
The Archbishop said it was no dif
ficult matter for schools to give edu
cation when 'possessing all the neces
sary means, but it was difficult work
when there were no means.
The children, said the Archbishop,
are taught by the Sisters to be' pious
and are also taught gratitude.
He prayed that God's blessing would
come down In large measure upon the
nuns. He hoped that they would go
on training little children in love for
God and to serve him. After the mass
the Archbishop gave his blessing to ,
the people and! administered the pa
pa) benediction.
The augmented choir rendered the
beautiful and special musical pro
gramme as published In yesterday's
Call, Miss M. C. Schaefer acting as or
ganist.
The clergy present at the services
were:
Father Collins and Father Prelato. Jesuit
Order; Father Clancy and Father Corcoran,
Dominican; Father Maximilian Neumann,
Franciscan; Father H. I. Spark. Paullst:
Father Clearjr of 8t. Francis Church; Father

GOLDEX JUBILEE: GIFTS.
At the Presentation Convent, Pow- ;
ell street, there was an Informal,
luncheon. The Archbishop j gave the
blessing before and after the repast.
The ladles who waited on . the Arch
bishop's table were Mrs. C. A. Stuart,
president of the Past Pupils' Associa
tion: Miss Maud Kilcommon, Miss
Mary E. McFadden, Miss May G.
Rosa, Miss Alice M. Messmer, Miss
M. Josephine Taylor, 'Miss Odessa A. ,
Gallatin, Miss Lillian Q. . Beaumont.
Miss Ella C. GcuCtney and Miss Anna
G. Williams. *
Among the mothers and sisters who
received the friends at the convent
was Mother Mary Bernard Comerford,
sister of Mother Mary Teresa Comer
ford, the founder of the order In Cal
ifornia fifty years ago. The jubilee
presents sent the Rev. Mother Supe
rior for. the convent were exceedingly
beautiful.
A benediction veil of great beauty
in handiwork and design was the gift
of the Sisters of Mercy, and another
exquisite offering for use in religious
exercises came from the ladles of the
Sacred Heart. . A set of vases ' of rare
design Â« and color, was the gift of the
Sisters . of the , Holy Names, Tenth
street, and a rich cloth of gold set "of
vestments for celebration of the mass

- As for," Dixon'8 pictures, they^ will be
open to the â¢ public every day and even
ing through the' weekâ the green room,
mezzanine floor, St. Francis.
Irij all there are thirty-six pictures,
among, which the following are for
sale: ;7"
: ' "Dusk," "The Prayer." "Mesa at
Evening," "Yellow Canyon," "The
Navajo," "Pueblo Girl," "Twilight in
Navajo Lodge," "Edge of the Mesa,"
"Navajo Country,*' "Evening in a Can
yon," "Mesa Land," "Moonrise in the
Navajo Country," "Navajo," "The
Mirror," "Bather," "Study," "Bathers."
.That "Moonlight in the
Country," "Twilight in a Navajo
Lodge" and "The Mesa at Evening"
are among the most alluring. In the
latter lies a tale of resignationâ the
Indian pushed oft his happy heritages
to the. hot, hard, pulsing desert, there
to live until death calls him â a kindly
release. ] It is '. in this understanding
of I the desert 'and its denizens that
Dixon shinesâ and success to him!
The Sequoia has arrived! And thanks
to its clever management; which has
succeeded its clever inception, the club
is an entityâ likewise a joy. And it yet
may become a â¢ thing of pride in the
West.
Last night the members and their
friends foregathered (word cribbed
from the invitation) in the club's ren
dezvous-at the St. Francis and spread
into the ladies' gallery and over into
tne_red reception-room ,'â¢ on the mez
zanine floor. Here were ! many green
boughs in brass , concerns on ;" many

"I was one of the kind who
wouldn't believe that coffee was hurt-

"You Just couldn't convince me its
use was connected with the heart and
stomach trouble I suffered from most
all of the time. My trouble finally
rot so bad I had to live on milk and
toast almost entirely for three or fotfr
years. Still I loved the coffee and
wouldn't believe it could do such
damage.
"What I needed was' to cult coffee
and take nourishment in such form
my stomach could digest. I had read
so much about Postum, the cereal
coffee, but never thought it would fit
my case until one day I decided to
"quit coffee and Rive it a trial and
make sure about it. So I pot a pack-
age and carefully followed the direc-
tions.
"Soon I found I began to get better
and was able to eat carefully selected
foods without the aid of pepsin or
other digests and It was not lone; be-
fore I was really a new woman phys-
ically.
"Now I am healthy, hearty and
sound, can eat anything and every-
thing that comes along and I know
this wonderful change Is all due 'to
my having quit coffee and go\ the big
quantity of nourishment I needed
Â¦through this delicious Postum in place

Sprott la one of the most aggres

developed.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 18.
Jack Sprott, who played left tackle
on the Stanford varsity elevens of
J1902 and 1903, will again join forces
with the cardinal squad this season.
On account of injuries received in the
Stanford-California game of last year
Sprott was unable to keep up his
studies properly and was granted a
leave of absence for one semester on
condition that he would not take up
football when he returned to college
this fall. His scholarship since his
return has been of such a grade as to
warrant the university authorities in
-releasing him from his promise. Dr.
C. II. Gilbert, chairman of the schol
arship committee, gave Sprott permis
sion to-day to again don his mole
skins and the husky veteran appeared
on the gridiron this afternoon for the
first time. He was roundly cheered
by . the rooters. '^ s-

WORTH ENTRIES.
PORTLAND, Oct. 18. â The dramat
ic editor of the Oregonian reported to
day's baseball game for his paper with
the following results: Ike Butler's
flret day as manager of the Portland
ball team was a glad one for the ex
ponents of cellar baseball, who wol
loped the visitors all over a mucky
field to the tune of 3 to 1. Things
looked drab when the game was
called at 3 o'clock. The grand stand
was a cave of gloom, tenanted by a
. few haggard specters. The first In
ning was as exciting as a W. C. T. U.
meeting. The lost Lenores out in the
morass played roly poly with a muddy
ball, while sounds id chattering teeth
were substituted for applause.
Inning two. Enraged by epithets
from the coacher's box and desperate
with cold the local talent made two
runs. All innings until the sixth were
the same as inning one.
Inning six. Iberg scored. All sub
sequent innings until ninth same
cs inning one.
Inning nine. Meany scored on a
two-bagsrer. The score:

attempt at a field goal from the thirty
yard line and Force turned the trick
as prettily as ever did little Hudson of
the old Carlisle outfit.
Gray kicked .off to the .visitors*, five
yard line. and Northrop came back fif
teen. After an Ineffectual attempt to
pierce the California center, Multno
mah kicked to the Blue and Gold fifty
yard line. Kern caught the pigskin on
the fly and ran between the goal posts,
but as he had swerved over the side
line two yards from the goal the ball
was brought back. This sixty-yard run
brought the spectators to their feet and
Kern received the wildest applause. On
the next play he made the touchdown,
but Force failed on the goal.
After the next kickoff. Kern, Mead
and Boynton went through their" op
ponents at will for all kinds of gains.
Finally Bovnton went through center
for four yards and made the third
touchdown. Force kicked the goal. The

' . Kern and Mead went in back of the
line for .California and made fronvflve
to;twenty. yards at a* clip through^ the
center and around the ends. " The home
eleven was getting close '. to the enemy's
goal ;, when > the \ pigskin -was , fumbled,"
Kitrelle grabbed it and then California
was penalized "fifteen" yards' for fallow
ing the quarterback to run with' the
ball." The ..team'; then" lined â¢ up " for an
KERX'S SIXTY- YARD ; RUX.
Multnomah kicked off and California
punted back to center after the first
down. Elliott nailed the first runner
back of the rush llne^ Northrop made
fifteen yards around the. Blue and Gold
left- end on the next piay. Here the
home team held four downs. Heltmil
ler immediately punted forty-five
yards. The visitors made "fifteen yards
on line plays and then lost the ball on
a fumble. California fumbled twice
arid lost the, ball on downs. 1 Mult
nomah worked the bait up 'to. Cal
ifornia's forty-yajd line, on' line
plays and then Horan was forced to
punt. The pigskin sailed up to the Blue
and Gold , ten yard line where Graves
made a fair catch. The ball was kicked
back to center. W-ttj
Honors were even until the half was
over, although Kerrigan of Multnomah
made twenty yards on a quarterback
run a few moments before the end.
â¢"After the intermission the .Blue and
Gold began to get alive to the necessity
of doing something. Gray kicked near-*
ly to the goal line and Northrop of the
visiting eleven was downed two feet
from the' scoring point. Horan punted
out of immediate danger, but Lasater,
White and Graves; commenced to find
holes . in the .opposing line. The ball
was carried right up to the goal again
and Lasater went - through for the
touchdown. '. Heitmuller, in attempting I
to kick 'out, sent the ball over the;
heads of his team and the chance for!
the goal was lost. - . Â» .
The " Multnomah team, which was
beaten so easily by California, played a
tie game with Stanford a week ago.
A comparison of scores brought de
light to the. football enthusiasts of the
State University. None of them seemed
to reflect that Lanagan plays-twenty
five men in his practice games and
Hopper only fifteen in his.
The California team that played
Multnomah yesterday is at least a
touchdown better than the average
eleven that played the same outfit at
Palo Alto, but that is not a faint indica
tion that fourteen men who may play
with" the Blue and Gold in the cham
pionship contest are better than the
same number of Cardinal huskies who
will be on the opposing side before
the battle is finished.
The bright, particular star of yester
day's game was Kern of the Califor
nias. He made tremendous gains
around the end and through the line
and kept his feet like a veteran after
being tackled. Lasater at full demon
strated the proper way in which to dig
into the line and at present is good
for more substantial ' gains" than is
"Jim" Weller of Stanford.
XO SCORE' IX FIRST HALF.
The University of California football
team had things all its own way with
the Multnomah eleven yesterday In the
second half' of the game at Berkeley.
Three touchdowns, a. goal and a goal
from the field were secured with ease
after the visitors had lost heart and
got on the toboggan. The contest was
as slow as a funeral dirge in the first
half and neither goal was at any
time in danger. The Blue and Gold
commenced playing football after the
intermission and the spectators then
began to get some enjoyment out of the
struggle. #

NEW YORK, Oct 18. â "Young
Corbett" and Jabez White, the English
lightweight champion, were matched
to-night to meet the first week in
January for $5000 a side. The men
will weigh in at 135 pounds at the
ringside. The exact date and place of
the fight will be decided later. The
club offering the best Inducements will
secure the match.
Corbett Meets White In January.
It was stated after the fight that
Johnson fought as he did to-night in
order to demonstrate that he was en
titled to consideration by Jeffries.
Johnson's manager stated he would
issue a formal challenge in behalf of
Johnson at once to fight the cham
pion of the world.
Manager' McCarey of the Century
Athletic Club announced that he
would offer $15,000 guarantee for a
match between Jeffries and Johnson,
the battle to come on! here some time
this winter.
Johnson showed to great advantage;
He showed a willingness to mix it at
all times, which is something he has
avoided as much as. possible In" his
Â¦previous battles. His" terrific punches
soon had his heavier opponent in dis
tress.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 18. â In a
whirlwind fight, which lasted less
than two rounds, Jack Johnson, the
colored heavy - weight champion,
knocked out Denver Ed Martin to
night at Hazard's Pavilion. The fight
was ' fast while it lasted. Martin
started to force the pace, and did some
fast sparring, but whenever they came
together Johnson sent in terrific body
blows. Martin went to his knees twice
in the first round. In the second
Martin started the fighting with a
straight left to the face,* but got a
hard right over the heart; which put
him down for the count of seven. He
got up and rushed acain, and again
went down from a left in the stom
ach. 'He arose at the count of six
and immediately got a right to the
body and a left to the jaw which put
him out

- Now that, all obstacles have been re
moved Britt and Gans are training in
earnest for their forthcoming meeting.
Gans went through a severe course of
training for his match with Walcott, so
that he has a* good foundation on which
to build up his formidable fighting
muscles.
He has settled down to the hardest
of work at Shannon's .Villa for his com
ing battle with Jimmy" Britt Hereto
fore Joe has taken' things easily, but
yesterday was a strenuous one for. the
man from Baltimore.
He was up bright and early and took
a fourteen-mile Jog - to Corte Madera,
accompanied by Trainer Billy McDon
ald and Kid Sullivan. He returned
perspiring freely and was given a stiff
rubdown. Â»
In the afternoon he spent an hour
in the gymnasium, punching the. bag,
skipping the rope and shadow fighting.
Joe will start boxing to-day and will go
a few rounds with Kid Sullivan and
Rudolf Grossman, ' who will be his
sparring mates during his siege of
training. Both boys are clever and will
keep Joe busy.
.The . question of making 133 pounds
ringside does not seem to worry Gans
or. his trainer. McDonald says Joe
tipp'ed the beam at about 138 pounds
yesterday morning, and will have no
trouble making 133 on the night of the
fight.
Gans says the climate of Marin
County is â¢ excellent for reducing. He
maintains he will enter the ring weigh
ing 133 pounds, and will be strong at
that low notch.
- Jimmy Britt is once more settled
down at his lucky training quarters,
Croll's Alameda, and is sub
sisting* on the strength-giving meals
prepared\by Mrs. J. G. Croll, wife of
the proprietor, who has cooked for
nearly every celebrity of the arena.

Smathers, to-day, in the third and last
contest for the Memphis gold cup. the
feature race of the opening day of
the fourth annual meeting of the Mem

After sustaining a terrific pace to
the three-quarter pole in the first heat
of the contest it was apparent the
mare was in bad condition and she was
pulled up, Major Delmar winning in a
jog. Despite a critical examination by
veterinary surgeons, who pronounced
the mare affected by an ailment
known to horsemen as "the thumps,".
Lou Dillon was again brought out on
the track by Mr. Billings, and a'galnst
the advice of the veterinarians he an
nounced that as a matter of form he
would start the mare in the second
heat. Major Delmar rounded the course
In easy time, Lou Dillon going at a

cream of the lot came in the third race,
when Lou Woods, the longest shot In
the race, at 40 to 1, won by a neck from
Scortic, at 12 to 1. Scortic, in jturn,' beat
the 10 to 'T shot Clausus a length. It
was anybody's race 100. yards from the
finish, with the field bunched all the
way to the wire, where Lou '.Woods' got
up on the inside and poked his neck in

a wild rush on the extreme outside and
beat out Clausus a length for the place.

JAMAICA, Oct. 18. â The notable
feature of the racing to-day was the
double triumph of 'horses running in
the name and in theicolors of Captain
S. S. Brown. The latter is in a hospital
recuperating from an operation. At
the close of the day the news was con
veyed to him'of the dual success of his
"cherry and blue."
The more important victory of the
two was when Auditor won the Hunt
ington stakes at six" furlongs. The colt
had No."l position and was pinched off
at the start.. . His rider, Crimmins,
never ceased persevering and, catching
the fast tiring pacemaker, Et
Brute, in the last furlong, Auditor
came on under punishment and won
cleverly in the fast time of 1:13. The
stake was worth $960 to the winner,
which-was entered to be sold for $1400.
Wholly unexpected was Captain
Brown's second victory of the"" after
noon when Ascot Belle came from be
hind the pacemaker, Bill Bailey II,
which had plenty of early speed, and
won by a small margin. She opened at
3^ tol in the betting and went back
rapidly until she reached 15 to 1, which
was the closing figure. Summary:

Â¦Â¦-^for reason' of such negligence and unskill
ful ness' we have this date revoked Mr. Hed
vall's license as chW mate.
For reason of such negligence and unÂ«klll
fulness pn his part we have this date sus
pended his license as' master and pilot of
steam vessels for the period of six months. .
Â¦ After a careful consideration of the evidence
in -this case we are satisfied that Peter V.
Hedvall. chief mate of the steamer Xorth
land, was extremely negligent and unskillful
in navigating the said steamer on September
lit. "1004. in net notifying the master when ha
(Hedvail) first sighted Point Plnos Light, an<i
that it was on the pert bow; in continuing to
run on the course with that light on the port
hand, which he admits he knew was on the
wrong side, and in not stopping the steamer
and caMing the master Immediately when
Point Plnos Light bore four points on the port
bow, with the land right ahead (which had
been reported to him some time before by the
man on the lookout), and In running as he
did fifteen 'minutes longer bead-on for the land
before calling the master. Jh aÂ» dear- night
any man with his eyes open, and attending to
his duty,- should have seen the close proximity
of the land and the dangerous position of the
eteamer. '-. Â¦ . â¢ - " â¢ *) '-â¢-Â¦ .'" â¢ â¢
The delay in rendering the decision
was owing to a difference of opinion be
tween the two inspectors, Captain Bul
ger advocating a heavier sentence for
Captain Bonifield, but Captain Bolles.
who knows by his own sad experience
how easy it is to run a vessel ashore,
contending that six months' suspension
of the master's license would be suffi
cient.
In rendering the decision the inspec
tors say:
After a careful consideration of the evidence
in this case we are satisfied that Captain S.
BoniHeld was and unskillful in navt
gating the steamer Northland on September
IS and lit last.', by not bein? more careful Jn
laying ott his course,, and in finding the dis
tance from the" last point of departure, which
was five miles southwest by west from Pigeon
Point Light to Point Plnos: and for his failure to
consult the United States Coast Pilot Book. Had
he done so he would havt seen that this course,
southeast by east, would not clear the land at
Point Pinoa, and that 10O miles on the log
would be two miles past or beyond ths point.
He should hftve given explicit orders to be
called when Point Plnos XJÂ«ht wan sighted,' or
to be called at a certain time when the
steamer would bÂ« at a safe distance from the
land; or. if Point Pines Light was sighted
ahead, or on the port bow. to change the
course more to the eastward, and to uv the
lead when nearlns the land.
The Northland went aground one and
a half miles southwest from Point
PInoa light at 2 a. m., September 19,
Mate Hedvall being in charge at the
time. Cargo valued at $1000 was jetti
soned and the cost of repairing the
steamer was estimated at $15,000.
Captain S. Bonifield, recently master
of the steamer Northland, Is debarred
from following' his vocation as master
and pilot of steam vessels for the en
suing "six months. A decision to that
effect was handed down yesterday by
Captains John K. Bulger and O. F.
Bolles, local inspectors of steam ves
sels. The license of P..V. Hedvallas
chief mate was revoked by the same
decision. â¢ "- Â¦

Fast sailer though the barkentine
Gardiner City may be, she does not
r-ecm to be able to run away from
storm and attendant disaster. She ar
rived in port yesterday morning, four
teen days from Tacoma, and -reports
having had a fight with a fierce south
east sale oft. the northern coast. This
was her first round trip since she was
towed us from Redondo a dismasted
and helpless hulk last March. A south
east winter gale blowing Into that little
harbor Jammed her against the wharf
and finally under it, tearing the masts
out of her and ripping the houses and
tails from the decks. Entangled in
the wreck of the wharf, ghe could not
be driven on the beach, but she had the
time of her life fighting with the
broken piles and splintered timbers of
the dock and smashing away at the
structure and getting many a body
blow in return.
"When the wind stopped blowing and
the big seas lowered themselve^ what
*vas left of .the Gardiner City was
hauled out from the remains of the
wharf. She was a melancholy thing
to look upon, but she was still in the
ring. The wharf was a mass of wreck
age, bo the honors were even, and the
plucky barkentine was towed to this
port for treatment- With new spars,
rails and deckhouses she was as good
as new and sailed for Puget Sound
with cargo.
On her way down from Tacoma, old
ocean, who probably had never for
gotten nor forgiven the fight and es
cape at Redondo, came down on her
in the shape of a heavy southeaster
and the battle was on again. Every
thing was secured for trouble and with
foresail and double topsails close
reefed the barkentine bucked the seas
like the fearless Amazon she is. .The
great waves hurled themselves over the
vessel, breaking in the doors and flood
ing the cabin and forecastle till -there
were seven feet of water in the hold
and four feet on deck. The barkentine
went down on her beam ends and for
four hours lay on her side, with, the
starboard rail under water. The pumpg
failed to work and the vessel was
waterlogged and helpless. This would
have ceded *lhe vessel for all time, but
with the 500,090-. feet of lumber aboard
she was unslnkable.
To right her about 100.000 feet of the
deck load was jettisoned, and when
the vessel came on an even keel it was
discovered that much of the starboard
rail was badly wrecked. But, as usual,
â¢he barkentine Gardiner City came out
of the fight alive and upright and
though damaged will fight the gale
a.Â£ain when ehe goes to sea. Â¦

The Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdle, section
director of the climate and crop service of the
V.'eathtr Burrau. is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMART.
Cloudy and unsettled weather, with frequent
rains, prevailed jaost of the week in tfce cen
tral and northern Motions and generally dear
weather la the fouth. Heavy rains at the
close of the preceding week caused high m-ater
in the Sacramento and Russian rivers and
ether etream*. Dry rcrtherly winds prevailed
at the close of the week.
In the interval between the storms much
progress wa* made in gathering rrapes. and
;t Is now rei-orted that the loss by tfce rain
will be less than expected, though a consid
erable portion cf the second crop was ruined.
The rals'.n crop In the Han Joaquln Valley |
..will be much lees than estimated earlier in
the season ow^ng to unfavorable conditions In
the last three weeks, "but a large crop has
b*en secured fn the south, especially In thÂ«
K! Cajon district. Fruit drying and raisin
making are practically completed. Oranges in
the Sacramento Valley are commencing to j
cn\or acd art dcir.g well in other sections.
Walnuts were not damaged by rain and har
vest is progressing.
Beans in nearly all sections have been con
siderably damaged by the recent rains, but
the loÂ»s will be lighter than estimated. Com
and potatoes In Colusa and Sonoma counties
were da.zr.sged by overflowing streams. Hills
and fielfi* are green, green feed is abundant
and early cown grain is up and looking vig
orous. Plowing and cseding are progressing
' Tvhere the ec'.l is not too wet.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â Cool. cloudy
weather prevail*^ meet of the week, with fre
quent rales. Tfce Sacramento River on the
12th rose to eighteen feet at Sacramento and
twenty Joet at Colusa. causing some damage
to farcins lands and crops. Northerly winds
at the close cf the week absorbed some of the
Â«urp!us moisture in â¢ the roil. Plowing Is
progressing, but In some, places the ground
has been too wet for seeding. Early sown
trraSn is op and looks vigorous. Green feed
is plentiful and growing rapidly. ' Beans, hay,
prapes and !ate prunes hare been considerably
damaged by the recent heavy rains and ia
come places the tecend crop of grapes Is re
ported a total Ion. Tokay shipments from
Sacramento have ceased. Oranges are be

ether Â«treasa in Sonoma County caused some
damage to com and potatoes. During the
clear weather even progress was made In
gathering late grapes, and it Is reported that
the loss with tfcie crop will be lighter than
anticipated. Bears In the vicinity cf Wat
scnvllle were ser!ouÂ«ly damaged by rain. On'
the whole, the heavy rains have been very
beneficial. The h!l!s sr.d fields are green,

Dried Fruits, Xuts, Raisins, Honey.
Prunes are now reported as showing more
tone In this market. There ia no longer any
pressure to sell nor any lowering of prices to
unheard of low rates to attract - buyers. At
the same time there is very little advance,
though the trade seem to expect- better quota
tions from now on. The very large and small
sizes are most in favor, and the mediums,
those ranging from 90s to 80s., are not much
wanted at the moment.
The Raisin prices below must be considered
nominal, as the packers as a role have with
drawn their quotations for the time being.
- Nuts are steady and moving . oS well . at
full figures. The demand for Honey is lighter
as buyers have supplied their needs for th
present. but the goods are well held - and
show no weakness. "'Â¦ â¢ !SÂ«.

mi sales. The market was kept irregular,
irther than weak In 'this- way. but the infer
ence of the advances on e'entlment was not so
elective .at yesterday and there " was more
disposition manifest to look for reaction. ThÂ«
action of yejsterday's late tradlns was a pre
clsjioeing cause to this view. The result was
a general conviction this morning that a very
extensive distribution" of holdings had b*Â«n
tfi^cud yetterday from 1 the strong speculative
htir.Js which have festered' the growth of thÂ»
jjreacnt bull market to the weaktr hands of
the n*w class of buyers who have been at
tracted by the latter ttasÂ«?s at the advance
and who made their firet appearance in any
rcttsiderable number yesterday. The conte
quence was a more Â§ potted market and a de
cline In speculative enthusiasm. The dealings
fell into a Etate cf decided dullness at various
times during the day and the rush to buy,
which carried prices comprehensively upward,
wa s not in evidence at any time during the
Cay. The profit-taking was not precipitate
ami was not carried far at the expense of
values. Any advance in prices was takes ad
\?.ntage of to sell etocks, but the pressure re
laxed at a recession in prices to last night e '
level or below." The consequence waa that
i:r> great inroads on prices were caused by
the profit taking. The policy was reverted 1
to of shifting operations from one stock to
cr...thcr to sustain prices throughout the Hat.
The upward movement in St. Paul was not
wholly convincing, particularly as old rumors
were revived- of -a settlement cf th- Northern
Securities trouble, this time by an absorp
tion of St. I>aul by Union Pacific by a bond
if sue exchangable in the proportion of 200
per 'cent in bonds fcr 100 per cent in stocks.
The usual lack of authority for these state
irents was a feature and the backwardness
of the refponse in Union Pacific was an ad
ditional drawback to the efficiency of the story
in Fupportir.g the general market. The ex
cited demand for copper failed to benefit
Arralsamated Copp*r. The news of the day
awakened little interest In market circles and
atttr.tlon was devoted to the record of the tape
a* affording evidence cf the public interest
or abstention from the dealings.
London vrtia a selier here and discounts
hardened there. ' The discount rate was soft
in Berlin, however, and the weekly statement
of the Imperial Bank . of Germany showed
the effect of thÂ« higher bank discount rate
ia a cash gaia of ?I2,550.O0Â»>. repayment ot
locns to the amount of *13,13O.0<X> and a
cote contraction of S21.C10.00O. Sterling ex
change at Continental points in consequence
recovered. The sub-treasury took a consider
able sum frcm the banks here tÂ»-day. thus re
versing the "recent course of the balances.
Mone** rates, however, were unchanged.
The stock markst closed rather easy. Re
alizing in speculative bond Issues made the
bund market Irregular. Total sales, par value,
$7,315,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

CHICAGO, Oct. 18.â The strength of the
wheat market developed after a weak open-
Ing. Under the influence of heavy-Northwest
ern receipts and lower prices at Liverpool in
itial quotations showed a considerable de
cline, December being down %c to %c ' at
*1 11^Â©1 llÂ«i- May was off %@%c to
at SI 10HS1 10?*. The obstacles to the up
ward progress of values, however, were soon
overcome,, and upon an analysis of the depress
ing factors the bearish significance was - of
small account. In the first place, many trad
ers seemed to believe that . the ..market at
present is governed l^fgely by the existing
domestic situation, the action of foreign grain
centers having apparently little effect. \ThÂ«
Increased rates In the Northwest did not appear
extremely bearish when it was seen In the
Duluth arrivals there were ninety-seven cars
from Oregon, which made the actual North
western spring wheat receipts at that point
smaller than those of .the preceding year.
From the tap of the gong until the last min
ute of trading there was an exceptional de
mand for December delivery. Elements " that
Â«ntered decisively into the situation later In
the day were the strength of cash wheat in
all markets and reports - of damage by Hes
sian fly to winter wheat In Missouri. The
high point for the day on December waa
reached at $1 14% and. on May at $1 12%.
The close was to 2c higher. December at
SI 14&<gl 14% and May at $1 12%@ri2%.
After a weak opening, resulting from easier
cables, the corn market rallied on predictions
of wet weather for to-morrow and on the
sharp return In wheat. December opened
H&Vic to %Â©Hc lower at 47%c ta 47TÂ»c, sold
between 47&Â«MS%c and. closed at 48%c. . .â¢
The oats market was influenced almost ex
clusively by. the action "of other grains.- De
cember opened **@V t c to U6%c. lower at
27%@28c. sold up to 2S%Â®28%c and closed at
2siic ;Â¦-.. . . Â¦ Â¦
Provisions - were strong. At .the close JTan
uary pork was up 15c at $12 25. Lard and
ribs were each 10c higher at $6 97V&6C 42#.

request for local use and, as receipts were
light and trashy, offerings ' of moat descrip
tions were well cleaned up. The market had a
steady . tone. . Apples -were the most active
article, a steady movement being' noted in all
grades. Another car of Hood River fruit was
marketed, making the second for. the week,
and cleaned up well at 90c@$l 10 per box as
to variety and quality. Peaches, j Plums and
Pears continued to meet- with ready sale at
good prices, while Pomegranates and Quinces
were inclined to easiness. Table Grape* were
steady under less liberal offerings of trashy
stock. Prices for general offerings of 'crated
stock ranged from 50c to C5c.~ but 75c was
easily obtained for selected lots of some va
rieties. Mutcats in large boxes were firm at
$1 23-S1 50. while $1 25 was an extreme price
for other kinds. Melons were dull at previous
prices and | Berries showed but slight change.

lower figure. . Citrus and Tropical fruiu were
rather dull. Grape fruit was quoted lowei

The trial of the suit of Albert Mack
to recover $25& from Henry H. Mc-
Plke was begun yesterday in Justice
1 of the Peace Van ' Nostrand's court.
Mack is the assignee of W. S. Leake,
who indorsed a note for Matt Storn.
the. horseman, ; for $500, Jointly with
McPike. The note became due and
Leake was mulcted for the full
amount. Suit was thereupon brought
against McPike for his half.
McPike admitted that he had
indorsed the note, but set up as a
defense that Storn had signed a
chattel mortgage to Leake on a horse,
Sunello. McPike was severely cross
examined by Robert Duke, attorney
for Mack^ as to whether he (McPike)
had not told Duke on a number of oc
casions that he would settle his half of
the note with Leake. McPike denied
this and the case went over for fur
ther argument.
After the adjournment McPlks and
Duke carried their differences outside
of the courtroom to the corridors of
the City Hall. Bystanders say that.the
fight was very pretty while it lasted.
Blood flowed on both sides with the
advantage slightly in favor of Duke,
but' both belligerents retired from tha
scene and went home for repairs.

Rodin, the great French sculptor, has

kind; There is a dramatized baby, a

with a gilded tenor and whatnot. But
theseâ except the tenor â are" obviously
lugged in ;> and of absolutely no import
to the action ; of the _ piece.
Scandal and' politics are the basis of
the .plot. A' young wife, neglected by
her husband, who is running for .Gov
ernor, accepts the escort and attentions
of another/ man, who is unhappily mar
ried. The*: wife is innocent in her folly
âabnormally so-r-but seriously com
promises her reputation.'
The. consequent scandal threatens to
ruin! the, husband's political prospects,
and the climax of the play is reached
jvhen the husband ; rushes in at the
baby's christening to yell, "This is not
me ; chelldp * Really, Theodore Kremer
at his creamiest could not have beaten
this. They have before the. christening,

Mrs. Annabel Joyce of 2661 San Jose
avenue is aged and decrepit and when
Ehe tremblingly held up a bandaged
hand for Police Judge Cabaniss' inspec
tion and informed him that it was cut
by a knife or some other keen-edged
Implement wielded by able-bodied Asa
Hanson, whom she charged with dis
turbing the peace, his Honor continued
the case until a less-congested calendar
enables him to devote ample time to
the hearing.
The female complainant alleges that
Hanson, who is a carpenter and dwells
rear her home, is systematically en
deavoring to drive her away from the
neighborhood and that in the crusade
he is acting as the agent of a Barbary
Coast saloon-keeper who desires to ac
quire possession of the two lots which
ehe now occupies. Hanson's method of
persecution, she avers, was confined to
oral abuse until she had him arrested
for disturbing the peace and then it as
sumed' the form of personal violence.
He invaded her house and struck her
on the face with his flst and when she
attempted to defend herself he drew a
weapon of some kindâ ehe was too agi
tated to nott> Its exact characterâ and
slashed at her with It. The blow was
received on the hand, which she threw
up to protect her head, and the wound
Indicated that a knife was used. Then,
ehe says, he hurried away and swore to
a warrant charging her with disturbing
the peace, the document being signed
by Judge Mogan. This case, too, has
been set aside until it can be given the
consideration to which its seriousness
entitles it.
Alta street is a narrow and rarely used
thoroughfare off Montgomery street,
between Union and Filbert, and when
L. Valentina, occupying No. 124, erect
ed a fence In front of his residence that
virtually closed the street to traffic he
did not think he was putting the gen
eral public 'to any considerable Incon
venience. But he did not take into cal
culation the possible effect of his fence
upon thÂ« household of Michael Brady,
occupant of No. 120, nor did he offer to
remove the structure after Mr. Brady
had complained that It put himself and
family to great discomfort In their go
ings and comings, . as It practically
compelled them to walk around the
block in order to visit their neighbors
next door. When suasion failed to
move Mr. Valentlna's obstinacy, Mr.
Brady resorted to retaliation by em
bellishing his residence with a porch
Â¦which extended in such a way as to
blockade and render useless an outer
staircase by means of which the Val
entinas reached the upper floor of their
dwelling. Mr. Valentlna's protests
were laughed at by Mr. Brady, Just as
Mr. Brady's objections had been over
ruled by Mr. Valentina, and when Mr.
Valentina undertook to tear down the
Brady porch Mr. Brady equipped him
self with an ax and started ,to chop
down the Valentina fence. The splin
ters were merrily flying and so were
uncomplimentary allusions between Mr.
Brady and Mr. Valentina when Patrol
man Peshon stepped In and with the
authority In him vested stopped the
work of demolition and advised the ob
structionists turned destructionists to
have their dispute properly arbitrated
In court. Judge Mogan has the case
and he will thresh it out In detail on
October Â£8.
George Stewart, an Afro-American
Adonis whose undisputed possession of
the cakewalking championship of the
Pacific Coast makes him the envied of
every colored gentleman who aspires to
social prominence on the Barbary
Coast, will be afforded opportunity to
morrow to explain to Judge Mogan his
reasons for having fractured the skull
of Louis Gomez last Sunday night at
Pacific and Montgomery streets. It has
not been ascertained exactly how the
fracture was administeredâ whether
Mr. Gomez, who is of Portuguese na
tivity, was smitten with a '/knuckle
duster" worn by Mr. Stewart or sus
tained the Injury by being flung vlo-
lently against the curbstone. Of one
thing, however, the police are certain
and that is Mr. Stewart's authorship
of the cranial damage that necessitates
Mr. Gomez's confinement to a hospi
tal.
It Is suspected that a woman is con
cealed somewhere at the bottom of the
assault and the detectives are endeav
oring to bring her identity to light.
Mr. Stewart's manly graces are so Ir
resistible as to make him a constant
bone of contention among the ladies of
his color whose habitat is Pacific street.
Not very long ago he was shot at three
times In rapid succession by a negro
who was piqued by the attentions he
(Mr. S.) received from Miss Anastasia
Johnson, premiere danseuse in Sam
Lopez's temple of Terpsichore. The
shooter was so blinded by jealous rage
that his bullets flew wide of their in
tended mark.

Five youngsters, whose father is Ru
dolph Miller, butcher, . may be the
means of having Justice tempered
with mercy when he Is sen
tenced to-day for. threatening to slay
their mother at the family home, 4%
Hoff avenue. Witnesses testified that
the defendant,' in drunken frenzy, com
pelled the woman to remain outdoors
all night while he stormed and raved
and threatened to kill her with a knife
if she dared to enter the house, where
the terrified little ones were loudly cry
ing. As his imprisonment would mean
deprivation of their maintenance, how
ever. It is likely that he will escape the
punishment he so richly deserves.
Amelia Duncan, young and passing
fair, complained to Judge Mogan that
the policeman who arrested her for
vagrancy would not summon a single'
one of her numerous influential friends
to bail her "out and the result was her
incarceration all night and the prob
ably irreparable damage of a blue silk
en gown that had cost her quite a tidy
sum and to which she had become very
fondly attached.
"Oh, dear!" Miss Duncan continued,
"I'll be ashamed to go on the street
with this skirt after you do let me
out. Oh. dear! It's Just disgraceful to
put a well dressed lady in one of there
dirty cells. Oh, dear! Ain't I a fright'
Oh, dear! I wouldn't take worlds an
let any of my friends see me looking
as I am now. Oh, dear! I guess I'll
Just sneak through back alleys till I
get home and then I'll put on my green
broadcloth. Oh, dear!"
But unless Miss Duncan's friends
visit her at the City Prison they will be
saved the shock of seeing her in that
soiled blue Bilk. She was remanded. till
to-day and the ruling evidently cha
grined her, despite" her. professed re
luctance to venture abroad looking as
she then did.

at the Red Rose Social Club's last hop
in the Turk-street Temple, and ex
pressed his disapproval so vociferously
that his forcible expulsion was deemed
essential to the preservation of har
mony. He- returned to the hall, how
ever, where he not only repeated his
censure of the management, but of
fered to assume it himself and "run
things in style," If a majority of the
masculine dancers would stand by
him. Instead of accepting the prof
fered boon the majority again expelled
him, and when he arrived upon the
sidewalk Patrolman J. F. O'Brien
gathered him Jn.for disturbing the
peace. With his ball clothes on Mr.
Callahan stood before "Judge Mogan
and pleaded not guilty, but the police
man's testimony overwhelmed the
plea and sentence was deferred until
to-day.
Minnie Howard averred that It was
not she. but her female companion,
who ordered the French dinner for
which she was held to pay. It was
the other lady. Miss Howard ex
plained, who proposed the dinner, led
the way to the restaurant at 531
Broadway. ordered the -various
courses ' and drank half* of the five
quarts of claret that were consumed
with them. When the fifth "bot" had
been emptied the other lady suddenly
remembered that she had left her
purse at home 1 and requested , Miss
Howard to await her return while she
went to get it. Miss Howard waited
and waited until she as well as- the
professional waiter were tired, and
then she .was arrested for defrauding
an innkeeper. Said arrest was an
outrage, she declared, for she was
simply a guest .of the other lady.
Judge Cabaniss, , however, ' could' * not

to forty-eight hours' imprisonment.

Another reason for the Mayor's de
lay in formally announcing his decision
is that Drinkhouse's friends desired to
have several of the witnesses who had
testified : against him recalled In order
to show "that they had been mixed up
in business transactions in the sale of
cigar shops that j were not as repre
sented and so impeach their evidence.
Drinkhouse himself thought that this
would look like persecution on the part
of the Â¦ administration and he declined
to take advantage | of the point,' pre
ferring to let "the matter rest on the
evidence as presented, which the Mayor
holds did not prove the charges.
Any one who was present at the investigation
could see at a glance that the other charges
were absolutely disproved. The fact that Mr.
Drinkhouse supplies but a very small percentage
of the saloons with his goods shows conclusive
ly, that he did not intimidate dealers to buy his
goods. . . - . Â¦ ... - -.
J One of the charges made against Mr. Drink
house was that by reason of his dealing In
Eastern made cigars the business of the local
union cigar shops had fallen off considerably,
resulting in the loss of Jobs by cigar-makers of
this city. From statistics furnished me for the
First District there has been an enormous ln
craase in. the number of cigars manufactured.
However, I am seeking correct figures relative
to the number of cigars made In this city dur
ing the last year or two. and I am confident
that I will be able to prove that. Instead of a
decrease, a substantial Increase will be shown,
which will disprove this particular charge
against Drinkhouee.
A delegation from the Cigannakers"
Union, headed by M. Blum, president of
the union, waited on Mayor Schmltz
yesterday- and conveyed a request to
his Honor, through Secretary George
B. Keane, that he either render a de
cision or reopen the' investigation Into
the allegations made against Police
Commissioner Drinkhouse that the lat
ter is using his official position to ad
vance the interests of his cigar busi
ness.
Keane brought word to the committee
that the Mayor positively refused to re
open the. inquiry, saying that he had
heard all the necessary evidence, which
he holds failed to substantiate the
charges made against Drinkhouse. The
Mayor said:.
I will probably rive my findings In the mat
ter either to-morrow or Thursday next. The
reason for my delay In announcing my decision,
which I must confess will bÂ« In favor of Mr.
Drinkhouse, Is the delay I have experienced in
securing statistics from the Internal Revenue
Department, relative to the number of cigars
manufactured In this district

Three applications to sell liquor on
the Ocean boulevard were turned down
by the Police Commission last night.
The proposition of N. C. Twilliger to
start a saloon . and cafe in the hall
built by the Ocean Beach Improvement
Club, which has been - hotly contested
by the beachside residents of the
gentler sex and many property owners,
met' with defeat.
The women, both those who reside
in the district and those who are In
terested in it from other motives, help
ed largely to win the victory for mor
ality. Mrs. Lovell White, president of
the Outdoor Art League, made an ap
peal In person to the board. Five other
ladies, residents of Carville, testified
that they strenuously objected to any
more saloons in , the neighborhood.
At the afternoon session the Police
Commissioners' room was crowded with
feminine residents of the Ocean boule
vard district. A large delegation of
ladies from the Outdoor â rt League
was also present.
Twllliger's case was first called. He
reiterated the statement that he in
tended to. conduct an orderly house and
that if granted a license he would per-
Action on the application of the Em
ployes' | Register Company, which ap
plied for a license, Was postponed one

was principally devoted to hearing ap
plications for saloon licenses.
Commissioner Drinkhouse advocated
letting Twilliger run his restaurant for
four weeks, ; after which -a decision
could be reached as to whether or not
the license would be granted." Several
of. the ladies of Carvllle were permit
ted to give their reasons for protesting
against the resort. After admitting
the testimony of others the Commis
sioners decided to go into executive
session and to give their decision inrthe
evening.
The bar and cafe must be In the samo room
and there must be no side rooms or partitions.
There must be no speaking 'tubes or dummy
elevator by. which drinks may be -conveyed to
rooms; the openings and entrances .must not
be. changed; nothing but tea, coffee and soft
drinks * may â¢ be served after 10 p. m. : no
drinks ' must be served Â¦ outside; If I any of
these conditions are violated the license shall
be: revoked. Â¦ ' --'Â¦ Â¦ - â¢

- Attorney John .Carey, representing
the element opposed to the granting of
the license, declared that if the hall
must be transferred Into a saloon and

were demanded by his clients :
