Special Dispatch to The Call
GRANTS PASS. Ore., April 24.â
That a hoy can be legally spanked by
others than his own parents, if he is
in need of such spanking, is the ver
dict brought by a Grants Pass jury.
The case was that of the State of Ore
gon vs. B. F. Kenyon and was hotly
contested in the court here. It is be
lieved a precedent of great importance
has been established and more than
one man's hand in town is itching for
a good and sufficient reason for Dounc
ing upon and administering a drubbing
to some youth who apparently does not
"get his" at home.
Kenyon gave Arthur Huejrerth. a
neighbor's boy, a severe "sDanking"
when he caught the lad in mischief on
the Kenyon premises. The boy straight
way told his father and the father
promptly brought suit for damages
While the reading of the law proved
Kenyon in the wrong and liable to
damages, the jury decided otherwise
and agreed that the boy deserved a
"spanking. " and that no damaees or
an apology were due from the man
who gave it.

F. W. LamboorDe ol Los
Angeles Claims His
Bride at Last
Mrs. S. M. Mitchell Yields to Daugh
ter's Pleadings and Archbishop
Montgomery Ties the Knot.
Hours of persistent pleading on the
part of two young and persevering
lovers won a mother's consent to their
marriage yesterday and 'the afternoon
found two happy heart* throbbing in
accord, as husband and wife departed
from the Occidental Hotel on their
honeymoon. Among the passengers on
the steamship Korea, which arrived
here Saturday, were Mrs. S. M. Mit
chell, wife of a prominent merchant of
Los Angeles, and their handsome
daughter, Lucy M. Mitchell. They
were returning from a visit to Hono
lulu and after a rest of a day at the
Occidental. Mrs. Mitchell had planned,
she and her daughter would proceed
to their home in the south.
Little did Mrs. Mitchell realize that
a surprise was in store for her until
late Saturday afternoon, when her
daughter coyly informed her that she
was seriously contemplating a wedding
tour before returning to the parental
roof in the City of Angels. Hastily
Miss Mitchell told her mother of the
presence here of Frederick W. Lam
bourne of Los Angeles, of how they
had long loved each other and of how
he harÂ«. journeyed northward with the
avowed purpose of claiming a bride
on the arrival of the Mitchells from
Hawaii. A little later Lambourne,
who is well known in Los Angeles,
where he is connected with the South
ern Pacific engineering department,
was ushered into the presence of Mrs.
Mitchell in her apartments and then
the lovers settled down to sound ar
gument to win over Mrs. Mitchell to
their way of thinking.
Mrs. Mitchell would not give her
consent and the more the young couple
pleaded the more evident" became the
mother's determination to thwart the
plans for a wedding. Finally the
father of the pretty miss was com
municated with by wire and back came
a response from Los Angeles for Mrs
Mitchell to stand pat. But Lam
bourne had come to San Francisco to
wed and wed he would. Miss Mitrhell
voiced this sentiment with him and
late Sunday night Mrs. Mitchell, find
ing that her objections were of no
avail, again talked the matter over
the telephone with her husband. The
parents then arrived at the conclusion
that a marriage was the only solution
of the affair of hearts and the glad
tidings were conveyed to the happy
young couple.
Yesterday Lamhourne. accompanied
by his prospective bride and her tear
ful mother, visited the residence of
Archbishop Montgomery, who per
formed the marriage ceremony. ThÂ«
hridal party returned to the Occidental
Hotel, where the wedding feast fol
lowed. Last night Mr. and Mrs. Lam
br>urnfÂ» departed for th" Santa Cruz
Mountains, where they will remain
several days preparatory to going to
Los Angeles to receive the blessing of
the bride's father.

the Loss.
MILWAUKEE, April 24. â Frank G.
Bigelow. until to-day president of the
First National Bank of Milwaukee,
was arrested to-day, charged with the
embezzlement of over $100,000 of the
bank's funds. The arrest of Bigelow
followed his confession to the board of
directors of the bank that he was a
defaulter to the extent of $1,450,000.
Following Bigelow's confession he was
removed from the presidency of the
bank and the facts in the case were
laid before the Federal authorities.
The complaint was sworn to by
United States District Attorney H. G.
Butterflpld. It charges that Bigelow.
as president of the First National
Hank, embezzled a sum exceeding
$100,000. A complaint and warrnnt
identical with those in Bigelow's case
were made out for Henry G. Goll,
assistant cashier of the bank, but Goll
could not be found to-night.
President Bigelow was taken before
United States Commissioner Blood
good to-night. He waived a hearing
and was held to the Federal Jury un
der $25,000 bonds. Dr. Horace If.
Brown and Arthur ftfcGooch certified
as sureties and Bigelow was released.
The Federal Grand Jury will meet
some time this month.
LOvST EM SPFXTLATIOX.
President Bigelow's confession was
made at a special meeting of the
board of directors held on Saturday
evening and continued yesterday and
all of last night. In addressing his
fellow directors. President Bigelow
said he had a painful statement to
make â a confession that he had mis
directed the funds of the bank and
thai an examination of his books and
a comparison of figures would show
that he was indebted to the bank to
the amount of $1,450,000. This money,
he said, had been lost in speculation
in wheat and stocks. Not a dollar of
it could be recovered and the only
sums he could offer toward com
pensating the 'bank were personal se
curities valued at approximately
$300,000.
The confession of President Bigelow
astounded the directors of the bank.
Bigelow had been recognized as one
of the foremost financiers of the coun
try. He has been associated with the
First National Bank in various ca
pacities for more than fifteen years,
and his* business connections â trust
companies, manufacturing' concerns,
real estate deals and other similar ven
tures â number scores, fie was hon
ored a year ago by election to the
presidency of the American Bankers'
Apsocination and by its members was
looked upon as a leader in financial
matters.
STORMY SESSION HELD.
In making his statement to the di
rectors of the bank, Bigelow saiji he
had been involved in speculation sev
eral months ago. This was in Wall
street. Later he had been a persistent
bull in the wheat market and recent
losses there had added to the heavy re
verses on Wall street. From small
manipulations of the bank's funds he
had extended the defalcations until his
shortage had reached the present stage.
He saw no opportunity nor possibility
of making up the amount and there
fore confessed.
It is stated that the meeting of the
directors, which was almost continu
ous for thirty-six hours, was stormy at
times. Several plans were suggested
for protecting the interests of the bank.
One was to accept the resignation of
the president, permit him to go to
Europe and the directors make good
the amount of his shortage. This
would effectually protect the bank. The
proposal met determined opposition
from directors who demanded that the
defaulter be punished. The plan to
make up the shortage was then ap
proved. Bigelow was removed from
the presidency of the bank and the
case was referred to the Federal au
thorities.
BIDS WIFE FAREWELL..
When the Federal marshal called at
the Bigelow residence to serve the war
rant the former bank president was in
the library with his wife. Mrs. Biire
low refused to withdraw and ihe war
rant was read in her presence.
"I will be ready to go with you at
once," said the banker. Then he kissed
his wife an affectionate farewell and
left with the officer, the two walking
to the Federal building, where a court
commissioner was In waiting. None of
Bigelow's friends were in the court
room during the brief proceedings.
When the resolution was adopted re
moving Bigelow from the presidency of
the bank, Henry Goll, assistant cashier,
was also removed. The removal of the
assistant cashier was due to the state
ment of President Bigelow that he was
aided by Goll in concealing the short
age in the bank's accounts.
The method adopted was an old one.
Collection accounts were manipulated
to the extent of forty and in some in
stances fifty per cent to make it ap
pear that the reserve fund was Intact
and the amount of the increased col
lection fund was diverted to special
stock operations. The reserve main
tained in Eastern banks was tampered
with, the books of the First National
being fixed so that the reserve armeared
to be larger by several hundred thou
sand dollars than it really was. These

ENORMOUS
DEFICIT IN
TREASURY
Administration Offi
.cials Becoming
Alarmed.
Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL. BUREAU. WASHINGTON,
April 24. â Administration* officials do
not hesitate to express their concern
at the growing treasury deficit. The
excess o f expenditures over receipts
for the present fiscal year reached the
surprising sum of $30,118,434 to-day.
At this time last year there was an
excess of receipts over expenditures
of $2,414,005. To say that the offi
cials are disappointed arid surprised
at the situation is expressing It mildly.
Meanwhile official junkets are going
on at a rate never before known in
the Government's history. The eyes
of the administration are Just begin
ning to open to this fact, and Secre
tary of the Treasury Bhaw put his foot
down hard upon the proposed trly of
Senators, Representatives and other
officials to Alaska on a revenue cutter.
The Rivers and Harbors Committee
has just finished a trip to the West
Indies on a Government transport.
At the same time. Secretary Morton
was entertaining a party on the Dol
phin. Including Speaker Cannon and
Senator Hale, in Cuban waters.
Preparations are going on for Sec
retary Taft's party to the Philippines,
which will be the most pretentious
excursion of this character ever un
dertaken. The party will Include two
score persons altogether, mostly Sen
ators and Representatives.
In addition to these junkets, five
carloads of officials will be taken
across the continent to Portland. Or.,
in June to attend the openlfig of the
exposition there, all at the Govern
ment's expense. Members of this party
applied to the treasury for a revenue
cutter to take them to Alaska for the
purpose of "Investigation." Secre
tary Shaw haa decided not to grant
this request.
The enormous treasury deficit
means the beginning of a campaign
in the late summer and early fall on
the part of President Roosevelt and
administration officials in favor of
legislation that will increase the Gov
ernment's revenues.

PLAN TO CHECK OUTRAGES.
Damages to Be Assessed Against the
Leaders of Mobs.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 24 âWith
â¢the object "of stopping the destruction
of private property which has been go-
Ing on in the rural districts under the
influence of the leaders' of the peasant
movement, an imperial decree was is
sued to-day authorizing Minister of
the Interior Bouligan to appoint com
missions in the disturbed districts to
trace the culprits, assess the losses and
collect the amount of damage done
from thÂ« real members of the village
communities implicated, whose whole
and personal property Is liable to be
sold at auction for this purpose. The
decree also orders the granting of
state loans to land owners not possess
ing the means of repairing their
losses. /
The authorities believe that if the
peasants are made to understand that
they must foot the bill it will have the
wholesome effect of ending the out
rages.

Manuel Munuzuri Escapes
From Acupulco Jail and
Conies Here on Costa Rica,
but Is Refused a Landing
MEXICAN GOVERNOR IS
HOT ON HIS TRAIL
Refusal to Marry the Niece
of the Irate Official Breeds
Trouble of Serious Charac
ter for Young Fugitive
Manuel Munuzuri, a wealthy young
merchant of Acapulco, Is held a pris
oner aboard the Pacific Mail steamship
Sosta Rica, which arrived here yester
day, and the prospects are that he will
be returned to Mexico, where an angry
Governor awaits his coming, vowing
vengeance upon hftn. Although no
criminal charge has been preferred
against him at this port, the fact that
Munuzuri is alleged to be afflicted with
trachoma may serve the purpose of
insuring his return to Acapulco.
Munuzuri, according to his own ad
missions, made shortly after the arri
val of the Costa Rica yesterday, has
been guilty of betrayal, his unfortunate
victim being Sabina Martinez, a niece
of Governor Manuel Guillen of the
State of Acapulco. For his offense
Munuzuri was arrested some time ago
in the city of Acapulco and confined in
prison.
Just before the Costa Rica reached
Acapulco on her voyage up the coast
friends of the young Mexican had in
terceded in his behalf with Governor
Guillen, and arrangements were being
made for his release on the under
standing that he would make amends
for his offense by marrying the girl.
Ignorant of the fact that he was to be
conditionally released, Munuzuri, as
sisted by several accomplices, made
his escape at night and was smuggled
aboard the northbound steamer.
At the time the Costa Rica departed
for this city the authorities of Acapul
co were vigorously searching for Mun
uzuri and had made a search of the
Vessel In the hope of finding him. When
the Costa Rica was two days out from
Acapulco Munuzuri was discovered
â towed away in the hold and was
placed under arrest by order of Cap
tain Morton, but the Mexican prompt
ly produced his passage money and
was assigned to the steerage. Later
he bought a cabin ticket and remained
cm deck the balance of the voyage.
Munuzuri seemed to have a premo
nition that more trouble was In store
for him at this end of his voyage, for
he confided to several of the crew and
the Central American travelers aboard
the vessel his secret and predicted to
them that he was not yet beyond the
reach of Governor Guillen of Acapulco.
"I don't feel safe yet," he would re
mark to- his fellow passengers, "but
they will never make me marry the
eenorita."
That the Mexican officials at'thls end
of the voyage had been advised by wire
of Munusuri's escape was plainly sug
gested on the arrival of the Costa Rico
yesterday, when representatives of the
Mexican consulate went aboard the
vessel and made anxious inquiries for
Munuzuri. Later a representative of
the Mexican consulate held a long con
ference with the young man, who. be
lieving that he would soon be on free
soil, boldly admitted that he was want
ed, in Acapulco and defied the con
sulate officials t6 prevent him from
landing.
Unfortunately, however. Fate was al
lied with the Governor of Acapulco and
soon dealt Munuzuri a crushing blow.
When he was about to go ashore he
was notified that he was not physically
eligible to land and his demand for an
explanation brought the response from
the surgeon of the Costa Rica that
Munuzuri was afflicted with that
dreaded disease of the eyes, trachona.
The disappointed man loudly ap
pealed to the captain and other officers
of the vessel to permit him to land.
Appeals, however, were of no avail
and nightfall found Manuel Munuzuri,
who had so publicly told of his affair
of love, under guard aboard -the Costa
Rica. Discussing his troubles, Munu
zuri said:
. "I don't know why I am detained
on board here. I have asked for the
Mexican Consul to come and see me
and get me landed. The story that I
left Acapulco on account of a love
affair is auite true.
"I had been on Intimate term 6 with
Senorita Sabina Martinez. She is the
niece of Governor Manuel Guillen of
the Estado Guerrero. They wanted to
force me to marry her. When her
uncle tried to compel me to make her
my wife I decided to leave the coun
try."
Munuzurl is a bright, intelligent
man, 22 years of age.
CAUGHT IN" WHEAT DEAL..
Billows Sqeezed In tlie Armour-

MILWAUKEE, April 24. â An inti
mate friend of President Bigelow
said to-night: "Wheat speculation ha 3
cost the Bigelows their name and the
bank a large sum of money. It is a
family tragedy as well as a tre
mendous shock to the financial circles
of the city. The father. Frank G.
Bigelow, had Chicago speculative con
nections with the firm of Tracy &
Co., in which his son, Gordon Bigelow,
was a member.
"In. the late Armour-Gates wheat
deal and the sharp fluctuations of the
market which have come durfng the
last few days Bigelow senior and
Bigelow junior were caught, and
caught for all that the bank directors
now report. Hitherto the family name
has been of the highest in the city
and the failure will come as a sad
shock to all that know them."

IHRECTORS PAY SHORTAGE.
The manipulations of accounts has
been going on for months, according
to the statement of one of the direc
tors, but so cleverly was the work
done that neither the directors nor the
National Examiners were able to dis
cover that anything was wrong. The
,/rst intimation that there were irreg
ularities came to Charles F. Pflster,
one of the directors, on Friday even
ing. An employe of the bank called
at Piaster's home and told him he had
something to reveal regarding the
bank. Although his confession was
meager it was sufficient to awaken
the suspicions of Pflster and to start
an investigation. President Bigelow
was taxed with the irregularities and
he is said to have admitted his guilt.
Then followed the meeting of the di
rectors and the full confession.
As soon as the directors ascertained
the full extent of the peculations,
steps were taken to protect the deposi
tors and other creditors. Charles F.
Pflster subscribed $600,000 to a fund
to make good the surplus; John I.
Biggs, president of the Milwaukee
Electric Railway Company, gave
$300,000; William Bigelow, a brother
of the president, added $100,000 to the
amount. Other directors subscribed
lesser sums, until the amount raised
reached $1,635,000. Then the follow
ing statement was prepared and form
ally issued:
"For value received, we, the under
signed, severally agree to advance and
pay to the First National Bank of Mil
waukee, Wis., the sums set opposite
our respective names as the same may
be needed, for the payment on de
mand of all deposits now in said bank,
or which within thirty days from this
date may be placed therein. Our
claims hereunder for reimbursement
shall be subordinate and postponed to
the claims of all depositors and other
creditors. (Signed) Charles F. Pfls

$300,000; John I. Peggs. $300,000; E.

H. Van Dyke Jr., $50,000; J. K. Kipp.
$50,000; Albert G. Trostel, $25,000;
August H. Vogel, $10,000; William
Bigelow, $100,000; total, $1,635,000."
BIG KUX OX THE BAXK.
Prior to this the directors had been
in conference with leading bankers of
Chicago and New York. Three Chi
cago bankers, President Forgan of the
First National Bank; Orson Smith, of
the Merchants' Loan and Trust Com
pany and Ernest A. Hamill of the
Corn Exchange National Bank, came
to Milwaukee on an early train and
went into conference with the direc
tors of the First National. As a re
sult of this meeting $1,000,000 was
ppnt to Milwaukee by Chicago banks
to reach the city before the news of
the defalcation was made public. Sev
eral hundred thousand dollars in gold
was transferred to the First National
Bank, so that institution was prepared
lor the run that was expected. Every
precaution was taken to keep the fact
of the shortage from the public until
ihe affairs of the bank could be put in
condition to meet any emergency that
might arise.
When the bank closed its doors this
afternoon more than 2000 depositors
were clamoring for their money. Near
ly $1,000,000 had been paid out in the
course of two hours and but a small
percentage of the customers demand
ing the closing of their accounts had
been served. One of the first caller.i
was a business man. who presented a
check for $100,000, the entire amount
of his account. He was followed r-y
the City Treasurer, who drew out
$300,000 of the city's funds. Withdraw
als in sums ranging from $1000 to
$10,000 quickly followed and by 2
o'clock in the afternoon a line of peo
ple extended from the bank ?ast on
Wisconsin street to Broadway, and in
the other direction around the corner
and north on East Water street.
DEPOSITS COME FROM MAXY.
The State of Wisconsin has several
hundred thousand dollars deposited in
the bank and it Is said that v. ill be
withdrawn at the opening of business
to-morrow.
The throngs on East Water street
besieged the Wisconsin Trust Com
pany, the Savings Bank department of
the First National. While 'many de
positors were seeking to withdraw their
funds, others who believe in the sound
ness of the bank were coming forward
with deposits. So persistent were the
friends of the bank in offering ::ioney
for deposit that when the bank ciosed
there was a Una of depositors waiting
opposite to the line anxious to with
draw money. While the bank could
not honor checks, it could receive de
posits and to facilitate the business erf
depositors the bank was cleared at the
hour for closing and a hole ma cut
through the plate glass window on the
Wisconsin-street front of the build'ng.
Receiving tellers were stationed nere,
and until a late hour this evening de
positors were still leaving their monsy.
The officials of the bank are iookli:<
for a resumption of the run to-morrow.
A request has been .made for a detail
of twenty policemen, the same nuraber
that was required to handle the crowds
to-day, and an extra force of clerks
will be employed to handle the burl
ness. Money Is on the way from New
York to strengthen the, resources v? the
bank and the directors expect to be
able to meet all demands promptly.
They say that the actual condition of
the bank has not yet been impaired
by the Bigelow defalcation.
The statement of the financial con
dition of the bank on March 1, and
which is the last statement formally
issued, is a strong one. It includes the
following items: Loans, $12, 646. 337; cash
and due from banks, $5,177,210; total
resources, }1Â»,567.275; capital, 11,500,000;
surplus, $500,000; undivided profits,
$642,232; deposits, $16,574,498; total lia
bilities. $19,567,221 44.
BIGELOW A BIG PROMOTER.
President Bigelow'a defalcation
amounts to about $1,450,000, but he
restored $300,000. The directors have
subscribed, it is said. $635,000 more,
thus leaving the bank better off by
about $400/000 than it was before the
funds were depleted by the peculations
cf the president.
Bigelow is left a ..poor man by his
speculations and the surrender of the
securities to the bank to-day. At one
time he was rated as a millionaire and
this fortune has been lost as well as
the sum taken from the bank. His to
tal losses in speculation of various
kinds . in two years are estimated by
his friends at more than $3,000,000. He
has a magnificent home on Astor street
and his family is one of the most prom
inent socially in this city. Bigelow Is
a member of the leading clubs, has
been known as one of the most gener
ous donors in the cause of charity and
has been a favorite with all classes. He
ts prostrated by the whole affair, and
although he appeared at the bank dur
ing the early hours of business, he re
turned to his home and remained there
awaiting the appearance of the United
States Marshal with the warrant for
his arrest-
In addition to his banking interests,
Bigelow was the head of several large
manufacturing concerns. Recently he,
with others, began suit for the recov
ery of $5,000,000 paid for a patent air
brake device, which, it was alleged in
the complaint, was worthless. He also
promoted an enormous electrical com
pany that has extensive works in this
city and is interested in several other
concerns of a similar kind. He de
clined to say to-day whether these had
impaired his capital, and declined to
discuss his defalcation or the condi
tions that led to it.
OFFERS XO EXCUSES.
A formal statement was Issued by
Bigelow as follows:
"I have no excuses to make. I do not
care to* speak of motives which I had
and had no right to have. The h
men among the directors of the bar!
have come forward in a way that
should give absolute confidence to the
community and they are deserving of
the highest praise. There are no better
men in any community and no stronger
men financially. The bank will be bet-
ter and Btronger than ever. My family
has been kept in ignorance of th<Â»
ditions, and their method of living is
not to be laid up against them."
Late to-day the /directors issued the
following statement:
"While the directors of the bank ran
say no word of assurance so far as the
Personal aspect of this unfortunate
case goes, they feel that it is their
duty, as citizens of Milwaukee and per
sons directly interested, to assure the
public that the First National Bank i?
absolutely solvent. We malfce this
statement because there is & possibility
that many people may thoughtlessly
confound what is a personal matter
with the standing of the bank, which
is one of the great financial institutions
of the Northwest."
The board of directors of the bank
decided that no attempt should be
made to shield the chief defaulter and
his associates in the crime from their
full measure of punishment, and they
will be prosecuted to the full extent of
the law.
At 9 o'clock to-nlarht everything wu
quiet in the vicinity of the bank. Post
ed on all the windows and fhe stone
columns at the entrance to the bank
were printed notices Issued by the di
rectors statin* the various amounts
subscribed, which, it is said, will more
than meet the amount of the defalca
tion. These were eagerly read by
passers-by as well those who have
money on deposit. ThÂ» nottc*. to a
great measure had a good effect on
many who feared for thÂ« safety of
their deposits. The bank is said to bÂ«
amply prepared to meet all demands
which may be made by depositors to
morrow.

PLAN OF THE CRUISERS
Turbine Engine to Be Given
Its First Trial in Navy
in One of the New Vessels
WASHINGTON, April 24-The rec
ommendations which the Naval Board
of Construction has made to the Sec
retary of the Navy for the construc
tion of three scout cruisersâ the Ches
ter, the Salem and the Birmingham
contemplate that the Fore River Ship
building Company shall build one of
the vessels equipped with reciprocating
engines and another with turbine en
iines, and the Bath Iron Works' of
Bath, Maine, the third with a different
type of turbine engines. Of the six
concerns bidding for the contracts of
these vessels, the Fore River and Bath
companies were the lowest for vessels
with turbine installation, while the
Fore River was the lowest bidder in
both cases.
The maximum price fixed by law f<#
the construction of these vessels is
91,800,000, but the bids favorably recom
mended by the construction board are
considerable under that figure.
The turbine engine will be something
entirely new to the American navy and
will be given its first trial in a United
States man-of-war installed in the
ecouts, which are required to make a
maximum speed of twenty-four knots.
In addition to high speed, these vessels
are to be so constructed as to have a
gTeat steaming radius. One of the en
gine* to be installed is an American
type, while the other is English.

CAPTAIN FORCED INTO WAR
LOSES HIS WIFE BY DIVORCE
SUES BELIEVING HUSBAND HAD DESERTED HER
Misunderstanding
to Be Settled by
Another Marriage
Troubles of Aulins
to End in Joy at
an Oakland Altar
An odd romance, involving a mid
dle-aged couple that had been divorced
by reason of misunderstandings grow
ing out of the Russo-Japanese war,
is about to be culminated at the altar
in Oakland. The facts are interesting
and unusual. -
After being called into service by
the Russians at Port Arthur through
the Japanese siege and kept from re
turning to his home for nearly a year
longer than he had intended to be ab
sent, Captain John B. Aulin returned
a few days ago to find that his wife
had been divorced from him and the
custody of their four children had
been awarded to her.
There has been a reconciliation with
explanations, however, and yesterday
a marriage license was issued that will
be used to unite those whom stress
of circumstances ha.d separated.
Not of the least importance in con
nection with his return was the fact
that Captain Aulin had $25,000 in his
inside pocket to show that he had not
been busy courting any other sweet
heart than fickle fortune, and to-day a
deed was placed oh record giving Mrs.
Aulin a pretty home and as soon as the
trimmings can be put in place it will
be the scene of their second marriage.
Captain Aulin has been employed in
the China seas for years and latterly
acted as pilot at Port Arthur for
Clarkson & Company, agents for the
Boston Tow Boat Company and sev
eral large steamship lines. He was
one of two pilots in the harbor and
until impressed into the service of the
Russians was a free lance and charged
his own price for his services to those
anxious to get in or out of the gun
locked harbor. He had many narrow
es> apes. The lobe of his right ear is
missing and a scar along the neck
Fhows how near a piece of a Japanese
sheli came to ending his earthly ca
reer.
TELLS HIS STORY.
In talking of his return and the
events which delayed it. he said:
the day of the first bombardment of Port
Arthur 1 went out in a tug to notify two
1, the Columbia and the Edward Bell,
that they w<re refused entry to the port, and
a> I c-in? back 1 received ray baptism under
fire. The Japanese are tine marksmen, and
It was far from a pleasant experience.
I was in the employ of Clarkson & Co. and
was kept busy gluing: ships out of port. As
there wer only two first-class pilots at Port
Arthur, of whom I was one, of course we
could ask virtually our own prices, and I
have come home with about $25,000 as the re
sult of my work.
Atter matters settled down and the selge
was in full operation I was called into the
service cf the Kusslan Government and found
it hardly as jjrofitable. as I have, as yet, re
ceived no compensation from them, and un
less they should beat Japan I hardly expect
t< receive any.
I cannot understand why Port Arthur was
surrendered, when at that time there seemed
to be provisions and ammunition in plenty. If
the fortress had held out for a month or" two
long- 1 the disaster to Kuropatkin's army would
not !.tL.- occurred.
At no time during the *k-se was there any
scare. of provisions, except as regards meit
and fresh vegetables, which one hardly can
expect at such a time. Any one with money
could purchase almost anything els? that he
desired.
PRAISES RUSSIANS.
I wUh to say a word in favor of Russian
sailors, who can be favorably compared with
those of any other nation; but 'the officers,
white invariably centlemen and pleasant fel
lows to meet, art ashamed to be sen doing
any work. If they would occasionally put
on a watt of overalls and work with and
personally direct their men their navy would
be the belter for it.

Eastern Press Calls Atten
tion to the Oceanic Com
pany's Oil Burning Liners
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, WASHINGTON,
April 24.â The successful trip of the
American steamship Arizonan from
Honolulu to Philadelphia with a large
cargo in 55 days and 9 hours, without
the use of a pound of coal, has created
no end of comment among Eastern
shipping men. The steamship came
14,000 miles without an accident to her
machinery and made no stops for fuel
during the entire voyage. An inspec
tion to-day showed her to be in perfect
trim.
California oil was the genie of the
trip. Less than 8000 gallons of oil in
twenty-four hours was consumed and
not a particle of smoke was visible
when the vessel steamed up the harbor.
She was as clean as a yacht on parade
and made all the old sea dogs open
their eyes in astonishment, knowing, as
they did, that the craft had made a re
markable run for her port of destina
tion.
Naval authorities have viewed the
voyage of the Arizonan with interest.
The only objection that the navy has
made to the use of^fuel oil is that it is
not obtainable at ports of the world
where war vessels are likely to stop.
However, if a vessel can carry enough
oil for a 20,000 mile trip the problem is
partly solved. It is possible all nations
may adopt oil, which would create an
immense market for the product and
greatly benefit oil-producing countries.
The Philadelphia Record calls atten
tion to the regularity of the service be
tween San Francisco and Tahiti main
tained by the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany and declares that oil burners have
been demonstrated to be a great ad
vantage to the vessels of the Oceanic
line.
The Washington Post, in an edito
rial, says that the use of oil on ocean
steamships long ago passed the experi
mental stage and that the work now
going on is merely one of extension.
"Steamers on the line between San
Francisco and Tahiti use oil exclusive
ly on a run of more than 4000 miles,"
says the Post.
Oil-burning vessels are becoming
common on both coasts of America.
With the improvement of the turbine
engine and the use of oil as fuel, a
gradual but wide-sweeping revolution
is taking place in ocean transportation.

OCTOGENARIAN
SHOOTS YOUTH
WOODLAND, April 24.â As a result
of a shooting scrape in Capay Valley,
twelve miles northwest of the town of
Capay, Saturday night. William Gam
ble, aged 19 years, lies in the County
Hospital hovering between life and
death and his assailant, J. P. Howlett,
a man SO years of age is a fugitive
from justice. The tragedy ended a
drunken debauch on the claim of Frank
Welch, in whose cabin it occurred.
Young Gamble had been employed as
a herder by F. H. Howlett, son of the
man charged with the shooting. The
latter was sent Saturday by his son to
replace Gamble, and they met at
Welch's cabin. They drank heavily
during the afternoon and in the even
ing Howlett fell asleep. Gamble sug
gested to Welch that they put the old
man to bed. While Gamble was ar
ranging a couch on the floor Welch
aroused Howlett and offered to assist
him to undress. Howlett declined. A
moment later, while his back was
turned, Welch heard the report of a
revolver and, turning, saw young Gam
ble writhing on the floor with Howlett
standing near him, a smoking revolver
in his hand. The old man then turned
the weapon upon Welch, who quickly
ran from the house.
Welch soon after re-entered the house
and disarmed Howlett and forcibly
ejected him from the cabin. He stood
guard the rest of the night with a
shotsrun, fearing Howletfs return. The
following morning Welch summoned
assistance and Gamble was brought to
the hospital at Woodland.

MISS ANGLIN'S PLAY
MIRTH PROVOKING
SATIPE AND POETPY IN PLENTY
Performance Good
Throughout the
Several Acts.
High Art Employed
for Enchanting
Scenery.
He who could not find laughter and
enchantment in "The Eternal Femi
nine" that Miss Anglin and her com
pany bestow upon us this week surely
could not find them anywhere. From
the comedy's engaging prologue to the
final word not a moment Is lost, to wit.
of poetry or satire of high degree. The
play is by Robert Mlech. whom Ger
many is proud to own. The translating
and adapting, that has been done as
" â by all the evidences of last night's
productionâ the playwrighting. Is by
Austin Page. An Easter audience, with.
its Easter trimmings in charming evi
dence, greeted the. comedy last night
and filled the California with gay
laughter throughout.
In uncommon ways has Mr. Misch
been consummately clever. The story
of the play, as most people now know,
concerns the subjugation by love of
the amazon queen of Halcyons and
her maidens. To Halcyone, an Island
. governed by women, where man Is In
utter subjection, come from the
Greek mainland Lyeander and his
warriors. A quaint prologue, blithely
delivered by Miss Blanche Stoddard.
as the Spirit of the Island, Informs one
that:
A 'venturer* from oder la&da.
Bold iMnen of the main
Who steer their craft upon thâ shores
Ne'er steer them back xg-Mln
â  The noble maidens of this realm.
At hatbands bid them tarry,
Their shields and words grow rurty
While their owners fetch and carry.
Of course, the sorry knaves protest.
Invoke. the go 6* and pray,
But all in va:r. â they're merely mem.
And here all men obey.
With these facts in one's possession
as the curtain rises there is not a mo
ment lost to entertainment. On the
chorea of Halcyone He the sleeping war
riors. It is early dawn. Come then
the warrior maids and discover the
Bleeping enemy. They go to inform
their queen, and meantime Eupolls and
. Manes, armor-bearer to Lysander,
awake. Manes is a figure that might
have been filched direct from Shake
speare. Falstaff was certainly his pro
genitor, and 'tis a taking composite of ;
cowardice and gluttony. Eupolis rouses â¢
him from dreams to the dangers about j
. them. â¢
With the rising of the sun then come
the Halcyone maids, and one rather
listens for the Valkyrie Ride as they
troop In with winged helmets and i
shields. The Greeks, eight of them, Ly
sander among them, hold parley. The
amazons demand their arms. They I
laugh at being asked to submit to
omen. One laughs with them. But
comes Antiope, and it becomes quite j
evident that the ladies, headed, by the
! strong-minded Sampito, mean exactly j
what they say. They have captured
the rest of the expedition, the amazon '
flag flies from their ships, the queen I
; Antiope informs them, and the victory j
is to the strong. The curtain goes ;
down, however, upon Antiope, already
unconscious â  captive of the beaux ]
yeux of Lyeander, ordering the pris- :
oners to her palace and not to the {
galleys.
. In all this Mr. Misch, deft and point
ed in his satires upon both sexes, yet
laughs with them. He has the touch !
truly genial for their foibles, a gym- j
pathy wide and delightful and an in
eight extraordinary. Hip introduction
of the one man of Halcyone that we
* are permitted to meet in the next act
offers further engaging evidence of
these traits. The captive warriors are
discovered in the palace of Antiope and !
the lone gentleman of Halcyone. Pil- j
eazar, comes to see his new companions
in misfortune. He bears a distaff,
wears a long skirt and Is altogether a
very meek and well-brought-up hus
band. That they are destined to till
the fields, weave and make the ladies'
gowns and Incidentally marry them,
. b*> tells the horrified warriors.
It happens, too. The court assembles
and choice 16 made by the amazons
among the warriors. Charming com
edy is this. There was a little extra
for some of us when Chloe asks Cydlp
pa if 6he chooses Periander. "What!
you miserable specimen of a man!"

But one less fastidious damsel takes
pity on Periander at last, and even
Manes is matched. Lysander remains,
standing apart,* and Antiope then tells
him that he is to have the honor of her
hand.
Comes then a scene of enchantlnar
beauty, a love scene worthy to set with
those of "Faust," of "Romeo and

possible poetic illusion. The aueen.

have plotted to desert their wives In
order to win them to permitting them
to rule the island and Lysander goes to
them. Every scenic art has been
brought into service here. The uncover
ed altar of Eros, the velvet brack trees
against the moonlight, and the music,
the dance of Greek nymphs preluding
the scene, all combines Into an Illusion
as perfect as it is beautiful. And what

Miss Anglln In this new phase Is a
new and again delightful Anglln Per
haps at the first the actress lacks a
little of the classic feeling. Her com
edy in the first act is over modern.
Afterward, In the garden scene, she is
appealing on even" side, grace itself,
all tender, all girlish, and still the
woman accustomed to rule. Later,
scorned, as she believes, she is all the
amazon queen. The portrait ranks in
deed with Quite the best that Miss
Anglin has yet given us.
Frank Worthing was eaual in honor
as far as his opportunities. To begin
with he looks like Apollo and surely
not even Apollo ever made love more
gracefully. Walter Allen as Manes was
capital, Mrs. C. W. Brooke, the same
as Lamyisto and the rest filled in with
all credit. A delightful performance
of a delightful play.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Alcasar.
The lore of a King's sister for a cap
tain of his guards, their misadven
tures and their final happy union
makes Charles Major's romance,
"When Knighthood "Was In Flower,"
go right to the popular heart. It give*
the audience a peep behind the throne,
removes the veil from the lives of the
great and shows them as they are â
just plain men and women when It
comes to loving and hating â and when
we look upon them in those moods we
forget the Kingship and Queenhood
and we laugh and cry with them, the
joyous and sorrowing things of flesh
and blood Just like ourselves.
In the role of Mary Tudor Lillian
Lawrence gives the San Francisco pub
lic an example of her worth as a ster
ling actress. She is the central figure
of the play and has most to do, the
which she does well indeed. The moods
of the impulsive, warm-hearted, hot
tempered Mary are depicted convinc
ingly, and with it all, though mere
acting, there goes the personal charm
of the actress. Nor does John Craig,
the Captain Brandon of the cast, suf
fer fey comparison with any of his best
efforts. He loves and fights as we im
agine soldiers such as he should, shed
amorous vows and crimson gore -with
ready tongue and reliable steel. The
play breathes the spirit of romance and
seldom has any production been put
upon the Alcazar stage so beautifully
Ecened and costumed. It calls for a
large company and it gets one, and
a good one at that. Among the lesser
lights, Mary Young as Jane received
many plaudits for her eit.. ent per
sonation and her charming little eong.

Vaudeville performances were re

OLD QUARREL REVIVED
Third Member of the Burton
Family Falls a Victim to
Deadly Aim of a Walker
BAKERBFIELD. April 24.â A feud
between two well-known mountain
"families, the Walkers and Burtons,
that has been in existence twenty
years, broke out again in the mining
town of Havilah this afternoon when
Newt Walker and Dave Burton fought
a revolver duel in the street. The
duel resulted in the instant death of
Burton and his Innocent companion, a
man named Bagsby. Ten or a dozen
shot* were fired before Burton fell and
Walker, after coolly reloading his re
volver, made his escape to the moun
tains.
Dave is the third of the Burton boy*
to die a violent death. Fletcher Bur
ton was killed by "Ben" Walker In
189 L The latter Is still a fugitive from
Justice. The Gibson brothers were con
victed as accessories to the crime and
sentenced to life imprisonment, but
were subsequently pardoned. "Jim"
Burton was shot down on the same
night that Fletcher was killed, but he
recovered, only to meet death a year
later at the hands of C. H. Allison, a
partisan of the Gibsons. Allison was
subsequently acquitted.
There is but one of the Burton broth
ers alive now, Luther, a prominent
mining man of Tonopah. He is noted
as a man of nerve. He has been noti
fied of his brother's death and when he
arrives at his old mo-untam home fur
ther trouble is feared, as the Gibsons
and Allisons are living in that section.
Only last week "Phil" Walker, the

ily, pleaded guilty to murdering an old

BECOMES FAINT
IN COURTROOM
"Nan" Patterson Weakens
Under Prosecutor Rand's
Merciless Arraignment
PLEADS FOR A RESPITE
Recorder Goff Grants Her
Eequest and the Case
Is Suddenly Adjourned
NEW YORK, April 24.â The third
trial of "Nan' Patterson, accused of
the murder of "Caesar" Younsr. was
begun in earnest to-day before Re
corder Goff In the Court of General
Sessions. Confident and almost smil
ing in the previous ordeals, the former
show girl to-day was on the veree of
collapse. She became faint at the
close of the morning session, necessi
tating a hurried adjournment of the
court, but had revived considerably
when the afternoon session was besrun.
The feature of the day's proceedings
was the opening address of Assistant
District Attorney Rand in which he
outlined what the prosecution intended
to prove.. He declared that Young
never carried a pistol and that the
State would prove that the revolver
that killed Young was bought by
Joseph Morgan Smith, brother-in-law
of "Nan" Patterson. Rand said that
he would prove by sworn evidence that,
during the year Young maintained
"Nan" Patterson he spent $50,000 on
her; that "Nan" Patterson and the
Smiths entered Into an alleged con
spiracy to prevent Young leaving this
country and to avoid cutting off their
enjoyment of his money. Young, he
contended, acted as one marked for
slaughter from the time he received
the alleged threatening letter in which.
It is said, Julia Smith, "Nan" Patter
son's sister, wrote to Young:
"Unless you do see 'Nan' I cannot
answer for the consequences."
While the outline of the people's case
as given by Mr. Rand to-day was prac
tically a repetition of those which have
gone before, it differed in some ma
terial respects. Much of the evidence
given at other trials will not be pre
sented this time, It appears, while the
prosecution promises to introduce some
entirely new features.
The strain of listening to the ar
raignment was too much for Miss Pat
terson. By the time Rand concluded
his address and the first witness,
Photographer Cole, was called, she was
on the verge of collapse. She wavered
and her head seemed to be swimming.
She called Lawyers Levy and linger
to her.
"I cannot stand it any longer," she
gasped. "I am ill and I am afraid I
shall faint if I am not allowed to rest."
Levy informed Recorder Goff of the
young woman's condition and the trial
was suddenly stopped.
Miss Patterson was treated by the
Tombs physician during the long re
cess and when the trial was resumed
she appeared to have fully recovered
from the attack.
The photographer and architect who
had prepared pictures and plans of the
cab in which Young was killed briefly
explained their contributions to the
case, and Policeman Junior then took
the stand. It was Junior who ran after
the cab in "West Broadway soon after
Young was shot and directed the cab
driver to a hospital. His story was a
repetition of that which he had told
twice before.
J. Morgan Smith and his wife, whose
names have figured prominently in the
case, made their first appearance in
court to-day. Wardraan Edward J.
Quinn, who took Miss Patterson from
the hospital to the police station, fol
lowed Junior on the stand and told of
his connection with the affair. When
he referred to J. Morgan Smith in the
course of his testimony. Rand asked
that the Smiths be brought in that
Quinn might have a chance to identify
them. The witness identified them and
they were sent back to prison.
Quinn said that Miss Patterson was
in a hysterical condition on the trip
from the hospital to the station house,
but that she became cool and collected
when the station was reached. She had
been there only a few minutes when
Smith came in. He went over to Miss
Patterson, shook her hand and sat
down beside her. When she told him
that Young was dead he changed color
and gasped.
The witness said that on the trip
from the hospital Miss Patterson told
him she had nothing to live for, now
that Young was dead, and begged him
to kill her with his club. She told him
that Young had no reason to kill him
self.
After several other police officers had
testified regarding occurrences in the
police station soon after Miss Patterson
was brought there, the court adjourned
until to-morrow.

the committee's action with reference
to the Continental Building and Loan
Association. Attorney Morehouse ob
jected, but Judge Hart ruled that the
indictment charged that the four
Senators had promised the Renters'
and the Phoenix Building and Loan
Association Immunity and that if the
prosecution could show that this im
munity from Investigation actual
ly given they had a right to do so.
The three witnesses agreed that
neither of the two companies men
tioned had been investigated nor was
there at any time such an Investiga
tion mentioned.
At the afternoon session the prose
cution rested and the defense called
Jordan to ask him if he had said, the
night of his release from arrest, at the
State House Hotel In the presence of
Night Clerk Williams and others. In
response to a suggestion by Williams
that he did not believe the Senator*
guilty; ".No, and we will make those
other people look like thirty cents."
Jordan Bald he had no memory of
saying that.
The Jury was then excluded and dis
missed for the day and Morehouse
moved -io strike out the testimony of
Jordan, all the testimony of Grange,
all the testimony of McNab, all, save
a few exceptions, of the testimony of
Tlchenor, all of the testimony of Har
tling except such as related to the
passing of money and all of the testi
mony of Russell and Alder.
He argued tot an hour In support of
his motion. The points he made were
that McNab, Grange, Tichenor, Alder
and Jordan were accomplices and as
such their testimony iÂ§ valueless. The
court, took the motions to strike out
under adviserr""it an dadjourned for
the day.
CRIME SHOWS
FALLING OFF
NEW YORK. April 24.â Although
the population of New York has in
creased 140,870 during the past three
years, there has not been a proportion
ate increase in crime, according to the
annual report of District Attorney
Jerome's chief clerk. In the detailed
report of felonies there is no marked
advance of figures as compared with
former years. The average number of
prisoners charged with felony who
were confined in the City Prison dur
ing the last three years was 176. This
is the lowest average on record.
The classified li6t of convictions dur
ing 1904 shows a startling preponder
ance of male criminals. Only 169
women were convicted, as against 2297
men. Of the 169 females, T26 were
found guilty of larceny and three of
manslaughter.
Of the 2466 persons convicted dur
ing the year, 1610 were natives of the
United States. The others were di
vided as follows: Germany. 182: Ire

undoubtedly the strongest of all those
in the play now on at the Central deal
ing with the tragic history of the
revet ed Irish patriot, who, after his
escape from Dublin to the Wtcktaff
Mountains upon the failure of his plan
to free Ireland, sacrificed his life by
i fMutming; for one more look at his
sweetheart the beautiful daughter of
Barrister Curran.
The presentation of the play, Charles
E. Verner s version of "Robert Em

vision of George P. Webster, opened
auspi'i'iusly the Irish Festival at the

Though full of tragedy and thrilling
situations that give ample opportun
ity for encores, there is plenty of
chance for comedy and catchy sing
ing and dancing specialties, of which
advantage is taken. Some clever lo
cal people appear in the specialties and
their friends were generous with en
i orea and flowers.
There are some ambitious scenic ef
fect s in the production. The perform
ance went off smoothly and the crowd
attending se^mrd thoroughly pleased.
Mayall as Emmet and Juliet Crosby
as Sarah Curia n have th<= leading
I in the play. They do some
strong work. Qeorfe P. Webster has
h chance for some powerful acting as
Father Drisco). thp faithful priest who
is with the hero until his execution.
While the trial scene is the most im
ve, thra in the Dublin Jail, v, here
the hero and the woman he loves have
thefl final parting, is little behind it
and its pathos l^ft many a wet eye
among the ladies present. Miss Crosby
givs thp audience the best of her tal
pnt in this scene.
Henry Rhumer as the villain, Michael
ihin. has a difficult role that he
masters well; True Boardman and
James Corrigan also appear to special
advantage, and Miss Ellsmere, as
Anna Devlin, receives the attention
that usually comes to her.
The specialties are introduced mainly
in the second a^t, at the home of
Father Driscol, where Emmet an
nounce Miss ('urran as his future
wife. The loom is full of gay young
Irish people in costume, and songs and
dances are rendered. J. P. Kelleher
and J. J. O'Connell and the Misses
Rossie and Haze! Allen performed some
Gaelic footwork tha, aroused the full
est approval of the audience, which
was not backward in attesting Its ap
preciation. Mrs. Daisy Keane-GHlog
ley sang some Irish songs, which were
also applauded with fervor.
The closing scene, in which a touch
ing lament for the dead h*ro is sung.
is one of great pathos. The bereaved
Ss'.rah r-urran clings to the cross over a
newly made grave, while the mournful
song rings out. Across green fields in
the dista^e is bppti the city of Dublin,
at whose university the patriot Em
met received his education with
Thomas Moore, the poet, and other
great Irishmen, and conceived the am
bition of freeing his country from the
oppressor.
From the enthusiasm it aroused it
se^ms that the play will do a big
week's business. It will be followed by
that other beautiful Irish drama,
"Phamus O'Brien," in which there will
also be special singing and dancing
numbers by local talent.

GUEST EJECTED
FROM HOSTELRY
L. Dalzell Battltes With a
House Attache. Who Hurls
Him Bodily Into Street
BIIEAKS THE FUKNITUKE
Patrons of St. Francis Are
Treated to Lively Row
in the Lower Corridor
The monotony of hotel life at the St.
Francis was varied last evening by
means other than the choice music of
an orchestra. At the busiest moment
of the dinner hour, when the lower cor
ridor of the hostelry was crowded with
handsomely gowned women and : their
hungry : husbands and escorts, \D. Dal
zell, a guest, furnished an interesting
spectacle as; he was suddenly bounced
out of an elevator by the hotel officer
and then unceremoniously ushered out
of the big establishment to . -Powell
street. . :â â â ': _.- â  ' / . ' / â 'â  â .
The scene in the lower corridor of the
hotel was the climax of a more excit
ing one that had been enacted a few
minutes before on one of the floors
above. Dalzell, who is a young but
stalwart Scotchman, well connected,
but frequently addicted to drink, en
gaged apartments at the St. Francis
Sunday. He paid for his room lor one
day in advance and yesterday he begun
contracting; an indebtedness that did
not please the management.
When one of the attaches of the
hotel was sent to his room to politely
suggest that the management would
rather see some of his money than his
tags, Dalzell assumed an air of indig
nation, which he apparently could not
control. He accepted the visit of the
hotel representative .as an intrusion,
quoted law on the privacy of ones
domicile and then grew boisterous.
Finding that this method of remon
stration was not impressing his visitor
as he would have it. Dalzell proceeded
to make a rough house by breaking
up the furniture of his room.
It was at this stage of the noisy
affair that the hotel detective took a
hand aad a rough and tumble fight
ensued, ending in the obstreperous
Scotchman's being thrown out of his
room and hustled along to the ele
vator, down which he was escorted
and finally ejected from the hotel.
Later in the evening Dalzell, evidently
fearing that his escapade might end
in his arrest, sought the assistance of
friends at the Pacific Uuion Club, who
called at the St. Francis and agreed
to stand responsible for the damage
done by Dalzell.
A few months ago Dalzell had trou
ble with a guest at the St. Francis and
finally landed at the police station,
where he was, however, released with
out being charged with any offense.
While drinking at the hotel bar with
a newly made acquaintance from the
East, Dalzell was accused of having
picked up from the bar some currency,
which his half-inebriated friend had
displayed. When the hotel attaches
ordered him to return the money to
its owner, Dalzell denied he had it and
he was turned over to the police and
taken to the station. There he admitted
that he had taken the money and dis
gorged it.

FAMOUS MINE
SUIT DECIDED
Jury's Verdict Disposes of
Rich Gold Claims in the
Cripple Creek District
FEUD OF TWO PAKTXERS
Conflict of Authority Be
tween Courts Keeps One
Litigant Long in Prison
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, April 24.
The verdict for the defendant, ren
dered by a jury at an early hour' this
morning in the Portland mine suit,
brought to a close one of the most
interesting cases in the history of min
ing litigation in the West. James
Doyle was plaintiff and James F.
Burns defendant, and the action waa
one brought to prove a partnership in
the Bobtail No. 2, the Devil's Own and
the Tidal Wave claims, located in the
Cripple Creek district in 1892. The
properties now belong to the Portland
Gold Mining Company, stock of that
corporation having been issued to
Burns in exchange for them.
Doyle claimed $561. 628 15 as the
value of his half of the stock with
dividends and interest. Burns' line
of defense whs that he and Doyle were
partners in the Portland claim, for
which Doyle received his share of
stock, and in no others.
The case dates back to February 7,
1898, when a petition was filed in the
District Court here claiming $620,000.
Notice was served on Burns Â»\vhile he
was attending the annual stockhold
ers' meeting of the company in Coun
cil Bluffs. He was at that time and
until February of this year president
of the company.
Burns filed a special appearance and
motion to quash the notice, objecting
to the courts jurisdiction. Judge
Smith entered an order overruling the
motion and directing the defendant to
plead.
Burns refused to come into court,
and, instead, commenced an action
against Doyle in Colorado to enjoin
him from proceeding with the suit
here, and Judge Lunt granted an in
junction.
Doyle came to Council Bluffs, and,
as Burns had ignored the lowa court's
order by failing to plead, Doyle dis
regarded the Colorado injunction, took
a default against Burns, proved up
and was given judgment for $717,025.
Doyle then returned home, was
summoned before Judge Lunt and or
dered by him to set aside the judg
ment in lowa within three days. This
he refused to do and was sent to jail,
where he remained for eight months.
In July, 1899, on motion of Burns'
counsel, Judge Thornell ordered the
default and judgment set aside, on
condition that the defendant dismiss
all proceedings in Colorado, set Doyle
free, pay all costs in connection with
the default proceedings, waive all ob
jections to the lowa jurisdiction and
try the case on its merits. This was
agreed to and in October of the same
year the judgment was canceled.
Two years later the case came on
for trial. It lasted forty-two days
and the jury brought in a verdict for
Doyle for $446,922 73. The defense
appealed to the Supreme. Conrt of
lowa, its motion for a new trial hav
ing been overruled. The case was re
versed by the Supreme Court and re
manded to the District Court for an
other trial. This trial lasted forty
two days and the verdict was given
to-day.

a letter from the Finance Committee
was read in which it was said that the
members of the Finance Committee,
excepting Supervisor Payot. would re
fuse to pass upon three bills incurred
by the Election Commission in its
purchase of supplies for the main
tenance of its department .unless the
proper method of procedure in the
buying of such supplies was observed.
The members of the Election Com
mission were wroth at the action of
Supervisors d'Ancona and Branden
stein. They allege that they pur
t hased the supplies as necessaries to
the carrying on of an election. Super
visors Brandenstein and D'Ancona
assert that the supplies wer<? not
necessary to the actual holding of an
election, but were needed only in the
general maintenance of the Depart
ment of Elections. D'Ancona shvs
ihnt the Election Commission is re
quired by law â and cites the decision
of the Supreme Court as authority â
to make a requisition to the Board of
Supervisors for all supplies needed, ex
cept the purchase of such articles as
are immediately necessary for the pro
ceeding with an election. When the
proper method of procedure is com
plied with by the Election Commis
sioners, says the Finance Committee,
it will approve the bills.
The bills held up are those of Brown
& Power, Bennett Bros, and Fred W.
Taylor. The bills, which aggregate
but a small amount, were incurred in
the purchase of hardware and sta
tionery for the maintenace of the
Election Department.

A Letter from Ex-President Qeveland*
Princeton, Feb. 6, 1905.
TN my judgment a knowledge of history becomes more important with
the passing of time; and it seems to me that it never was so im-
portant as in these days of stirring events and wondrous change.
|! Many of us are obliged to confess that for one reason or another
we missed opportunities to study history in younger days. However
much we may now lament this, we know the only chance we shall have
to remedy our embarrassing deficiency must be found in an arrange-
ment of historical facts and epochs, in such a way as to be suited to
the engrossing occupations and scant leisure of our later years.
I have never seen a work that so completely answers this pur-
pose as The His' orians' History of the World. It is of broader import-
ance than a mere book of reference, and yet no book of reference can
be more comprehensive or easier of profitable utilization.
1 1 believe those who have these volumes within their reach are
provided with the means of a substantial historical equipment.

Asparagus Rust Cured as
Result of Experiments
31ade l>\ University Man
BULLETIN is ISSUED
Professor Rttlpfa K. Smith
Describes Methods Used
' to Stamp Out the Test
BERKELEY. April 24. â The dread
ed asparagus rust is discussed in a
bulletin issued to-day by the" agri
cultural department of the State Unl2
versity. Ralph K. Smith, author of the
bulletin, declaring that as a result of
his two years' work upon the subject,
"the <iifflcult problem of protecting
the (asparagus)- piant from rust may
be regarded as solved to a very satis
factory extent, and it is believed that
the best growers will continue to pro
duce asparagus successfully and
profitably, which could not be done
â¢with the rust unchecked."
â¢ Professor Smith was brought from
Massachusetts two years .ago to com
bat the asparagus rust problem which
confronted California growers of the
vegetable. He had worked on the
same problem in the East. The Oali
fornianF most interested raised a fund
of $2500 for the support of such an
investigation as Professor Smith has
been conducting. The University of
California had been appealed to for
"eld in the matter, but could do noth
ing because of lack of funds.
The asparagus industry of California
Is declared by Professor Smith to be
very important, there being 7000 acres
planted to the vegetable. The expert's
work was carried on at the Boots
ranch, near San Jose. The other
asparagus districts of the State, how
ever, have been all visited by him.
Professor Smith summarizes the most
valuable results achieved by him as
follows: â¢''â¢;;
ThÂ« discovery of climatic conditions pecu
lÂ«rly favorable to rust suppression in the
cre&test -producing region of the
ttste.
The determination of tha beet cultural and
ether means for raking- advantage of such,
conditions.
Other cultural methods found - effective â  in
keeplnr down thÂ« disease.
A test of many methods of treatment by
* epraying and similar operations.
The discovery of the peculiar effectiveness
rf sulphur, when properly applied, in treating
thÂ» rust in California.
Determination of the best methods, time,
etc., for applying sulphur and the development
of Â»pr ial appliances and machinery- for the
purpose.
The discovery and study of an active para
eit* dm the rust 'fungus.
The determination of comparative resistance !
to the ruÂ«*t of the various varieties of aspara- |
sus. importation of varieties not obtainable in j
this country, and the commencement of breed
ing experiments for the production of new
varieties, ruet-reslstant and otherwise desir
able.

HKAK CHAK<,|-> AGAINST RIGH.
OAKLAND. April 24. â Charges
made by Mr. and Mrs. M. J. Bleuel
of 2<"Â» Watson avenue against C X-
Rugh. acting principal of the Frank
lin School, .-. â  brutally pun
ishing their son, Lawrence Bleuel. and
of spitefully expelling their daughter,
Vera Bleuel. were heard to-night by
thp Rule*= and Regulations Committee
of the Board of Education. Mrs.
Bleuel read a long statement covering
her views of the trouble and declaring
â that the boy had been whipped until
he was black and blue from head to
feet. The boy's father and his sister
corroborated the statement as to the
effect of the punishment.
Principal Rugh testified that the
boy had been disciplined for disobedi
ence; that the whipping had not been
too severe and that it had been in
flicted in the presence of D. A. Val
entine, the school janitor. Valentine
testified that the boy had not been un
duly punished. Rugh presented a sec
tion of thin rubber gas tubing as the in
strument of correction. Miss Grace M.
Hoptetter. the girl's teacher, said she
had sent the pupil to Principal Rugh
for violation of the rules of the class
room. The boy, in response to ques
tions, said he had been punished about
forty times by the regular principal,
J. F. Chandler. The committee took
th* rase under advisement.
GfTEX CHARGE OF IXDIGEXTS.
OAKLAND, April 24. â The Board of
Supervisors to-day adopted a resolu
tion empowering the Associated Chari

board upon all applications for indi
gent relief, commencing with July 1,
the beginning of the next fi>cn) year.
The organisation will be allowed $60
a month to meet the expense of the
work and to attend to urgent cases

regular routine.
This decision was reached after a
conference in which the members of
the board and B. H. Pendleton. the
Rev. Charles R. Brown and Miss? C.
Anita Whitney pÂ£ the Associated

lief, to weed out possible impostors
and frauds, and particularly to check
the operations of professional mendi
cants. In it? general work the Asso
ciated Charities keeps a careful record
of persons who apply for help through
the '-srious charitable organizations
and is thus able to note whence comes
assistance and in what kind.

to be entertained â in "delightful fashion. To
night Mis* .Smith and Miss Chase "shared' the
honors of one of the most unique and elaborate
dinners ever given In Oakland. '- It was a tete
a-tete dinner, \ the thirty-two guests being
toatcd at sixteen small tables, in couples that
cnanged partners with every course.
I 'ink was the predominating , shade . in .the
scheme jof decoration, long â  sprays of rambler
ana due-heps roses â¢ combining to form an ex
quisite bower. . with clusters or- Kaster lilies
here ana there. In one room Mies Smith and
Air. Oliver presided at the central table, sur
rounded, by the. men and maids of their wÂ«l
(iliwr party. Id another room. Miss Chase and
Mr. Bell were similarly : arranged with their
bridal party. .In thsse two rooms the chande
liers were almost concealed â  with . pink roses,
and dependent lrom each were clusters of
tiny pink tulle wedding bells;; ." ; -.;â '
'I he effect was de.lKhtiul; For the maids
the name cards were v artistic little "â¢ cupids,,
the cupiag of the two brides-elect â  being dis ;
anguished by the - addition of two pierced
Hearts. The men's place â  cards were brides â
pretty and dainty enough to tempt an anchorite
to matrimony. ' An orchestra kept up a'pleas
ant' accompaniment to " the \ merry chatter -of
the â  guests . and occasionally â¢; when â  some' par
ticulariy sentimental air was played the. whole
company joined in 'â  the chorus. Repartee and
leasts were plentiful and as ' each girl had a
different vis-a-vis with every course the even
ing was iraught with . interest from . beginning â 
to end. â  . : ' ; ' ; ' >>',â :-
Dancing followed the dinner. The gowns
worn by the girls of the party were
uiidauany brrautiiui, the dark-haired hostess

luncheon and the Belcher dinner for MisÂ«

day Miss Chabot will gather this merry
â¢bunch of buds" about her and Friday even
ing the dinner at which Miss Smith will en
teruin the bridal party will take place at
Arbor Villa.
Another engaged girl has been added to the
list, and now the friends of Miss Ada L<ay
mance are planning a succession of affaire in
her honor. Kdward H. Dodge of Alameda is
thf lucky man. The announcement of their
engagement â made public at a card party
last Saturdayâ was not an overwhelming sur
prise, as Dame Grundy has been building all
kinds of air castles about that Dodge automo
bile that has been puffing up to the Laymanoe
residence very frequently of late.
Both young people are to be congratulated
and the match seems to give much pleasure to
friends of both families. Mr. Dodge is a eoa
of E. J. Dodge, the w*ll-kno>WÃ- lumber mer

of M. .T. Laymance. one of the most successful
real estate men of Oakland and San Francl-co.

of Alfred Wllkie, the well-known singerâAl
fred Rlgby Wllkle. Young Wllkle'a bride
elect is Mise Blanche Gertrude Uddell, the
daughter of a mining engineer and superin
tendent In Tuolumne County.
The wedding will be witnessed by member*
of the family only and will be very simple
owing to the recent death of Mrs. Wllkle. the
groom's mother.
ALAMEDA, April 24.â Miss Anita E. Park
er, daughter of Mrs. J. M. Parker of 2310 .Ala
meda avenue, will become the bride of Theo

Mitchell, even if you have a few
brains, and as long as I belong to it I
am going to enter my protest against
such proceedings ac this. Nothing was
ever said to me about giving Dr.
Clark this authority. The reason is
clear, though. You knew I would op
pose It."

however, the board passed a blanket
resolution authorising Dr. Clark to
make such appointments as he saw fit,

appointees.

ing the trial personalities between
counsel flew thick and fast. Accord -
Ing; to Carpenter's allegations these
finally culminated in statements made
by Ashley in open court to the effect
that Carpenter ought to be disbarred,
wÂ«ue guilty of perjury and of sub
ornation of perjury.
At the conclusion of the trial Ashley
succeeded in having Carpenter indicted
by the Grand Jury or. the- charge of
subornation of perjury and he was
brought to trial and found guilty. He
subsequently appealed to ihe Supreme
Court and that body reversed the ver

Following his release Carpenter be

While acknowledging jurisdiction, the
Supreme Court declined to entertain

< or: S SIX ADDBBBB JURY
AT SMITH MURDER TRIAL
Attorney Henry Ach Makes a Long Ar
gument far the Defendant and the
DL-triet Attorney Replies.
Attorney Henry Ach occupied nearly
the whole of yesterday in his argu
â  to the jury on behalf of Joseph
Smith the agred contractor, charged
*ith the murder of Joseph E. Mc
i!<<G& Mission street on No
vember 26. He severely criticized the
methods of the Police Department In
sweating" the defendant immediately
aft<-r his arrest. He -said it was done
o other State, and reminded him
of the methods in voifue in France.
After they had finished with the old
Hian they sent him to the Harbor Hos
uaL
He argued that the blows the old
received from McGowan so dazed
him that he did not know what he was
c. and he referred to the expert
testimony given on that point. He
meed James Beatty, the chief
for the prosecution, in un
â¢ ring terms and attacked the Dis
trict Attorney for taking a witness off
the stand and after consulting with
him making him testify just as he
wanted.
District Attorney Byington began
hip closing argument, and the first
thing he did was to characterize the
ptatement of Ach as to coaching a
*irness ss a deliberate falsehood. The
District Attorney will conclude his
argument this morning.

SEEK TO SAVE CONTOUR
OF HILL FOR PARK.
CITY MAY BUY QUARRY LOTS
Supervisors to Make
Appropriation if
Funds Permit.
The Supervisors have come to the
rescue of the public-spirited women
who are striving to have the contour
of Telegraph Hill preserved for the
park that it is hoped to establish
ther.-. About thÂ« % base of this historic
landmark ihere are five pieces of prop
erty In the control of a quarrying con
cern, and t,-utrageous disfigurement of
the slope is threatened. If the city's
finances permit, the Board of Super
visors resolved yesterday funds will
be set apart in the budget to buy these
properties and save them from the
ruthless blasting.
It if ex Dec ted to have a bond issue
voted on at the election in November
to provide the means to build a park on
the hill. The pro-position was barely
defeated at the former bond election,
but the Outdoor Art League has never
ceased to agitate the matter.
The blasting planned at the foot of
the hill would destroy the contour, and
in anticipation of a favorable outcome
of the fall election, the Supervisors
were asked to buy the properties. The
land will probably be added to the
tract of the original park site.
The Supervisors, in their resolution,
recite that "public interest and neces
sity demand the immediate acquisition
by the city </f an additional public park
on Telegraph iflll." To that end the
Finance Committee is requested to ap
propriate in the next budget a sum not
exceeding $25,000 for the purchase of
fifty vara lot No. 532 at the southwest
corner of Chestnut and Kearny
streets and such other property sit
uated along the northerly and north
easterly bluff o-f Telegraph Hill as can
b* acquired. The resolution recites that
the grading, blasting and excavating
will permanently injure and impair the
present condition and appearance of
Telegraph Hill and If continued will
render impossible its proposed improve
ment.
The board also adopted a resolution
directing the City Attorney to com
mence at once an action to enjoin the
Globe Grain and Milling Company,
John Center and Pennington Broth
ers from exploding blasts and excavat
ing on Che.it nut street, between Kearny
and Montgomery, and on Winthrop
street, between Chestnut and Lombard,
and causing any portion of the streets
to cave away and be reduced below
grade.
The permit granted in 1903 to the
company named to explode blasts for
grading purposes in the block bounded
by Montgomery, Kearny, Francisco
and Chestnut streets was repealed.
Grades were ordered changed on San
chez and Twenty-third streets.
PLAN FOR CITY
TO TAKE ROAD
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print a proposed ordinance
introduced by Braunhart, "Declaring
that public interest and necessity de
mand the acquisition, construction and
completion by the city and county of
a public- utility, to wit: A street rail
road from Market street, on Geary
street, along Geary street to Point
Lobos avenue, along Point Lobos av
enue to Tenth avenue, and alorlg/Tenth
avenue to Fulton 'street."
The Board of Public Works will be
directed, if the bill passes, to procure,
through the City Engineer, and file
with the Supervisors, plans and esti
mates of the cost of original construc
tion and completion by the city and
county of the street railroad.
The plans contemplate the following
conditions:
FSrst â The conversion of the present Geary
street road into an electric road, with under
ground onductors of electricity, onductor
catilt, lead covered, and ducts for cable, from
Market street alone Geary street to Point
Lobos avtnuf, and along Point Lobos avenue to
Fifth avenue. 5.238 miles.
Second â New electric road, double tracks,
with underground conductors of electricity,
with conductor cable, lead covered, and ducts
f..r rable. alor.gr Point Lobos avenue, from Fifth
avenue to Tenth, along Tenth avenue to Fulton
street, .808 miles. Including bituminous rock
or asphalt pavement between rails and for two
feet on â¢-acbÂ»side thereof, and including re
moval of water and gas pipes, conduits and
other obstructions.
Third â The necessary cars, tools and appli
ances required to operate ' the entire road,' ex
cluding power. - '- 'â  â  - . 'â  â â <â¢â¢.-,.â 
Fourth â Storage battery required in opera
tion of the road when electric power to operate
is furnished. '-.' ' .':...- , .-.Â»'. ' 7
Supervisor Brandenstein said that he
was not sanguine of the ultimate suc
cess of the municipal ownership of the
road, yet he would vote in favor of the
ordinance. Braunhart produced figures
to show that it would cost $521,697 to
convert the road into an electric sys
tem with thirty cars. The sum of
$275,847 would be required in this
year's budget to carry out the plan.
Comte thought the experiment of oper
ating the road should be tried by the
city and if it failed then it could sell
the system to private parties. D'An
cona favored the declaratory ordinance,
as It would legalize any appropriation
made for the purpose after other im
provements, including street repairs,
had been provided for.

Something of a stir locally has been
caused by the discovery that the

investigate what has been done in
irrigation and also to consider the
possibilities of irrigation in this State,
excludes entirely the San Joaquin val

Letters have been received by mem

fact that the present intention of the
visiting Congressmen is to leave out
the Han Joaquin valley, in which great
irrigation systems have been in exist
ence for many years. An inspection
will be made at Yuma, and the party
will then iook at other points in
Southern California. The visitors will
come to this city by the coast line. One
day will be given to San Francisco and
two days in the Sacramento Valley.
The attention of the Congressmen
will be called to the San Joaquin Val

ALLOWS APPEAL
TO SUPERVISORS
Charter Amendment Aimed
to Give Belief When Liquor
Permits Are Denied
Supervisor Hocks submitted a pro
posed charter amendment to the
Board of Supervisors yesterday which
provides that any person whose per
mit to sell liquors shall be revoked,
or to whom a permit shall be refused
by the Police Commission, shall have
the right, within ten days after the
decision, to appeal from such decis
ion to the Board of Supervisors. Upon
such appeal he shall have a new
hearing before the Board of Super
visors, which shall have the right to
either affirm, reverse or annul the
action of the Police Commissioners or
grant a permit to the appellant. The
amendment also empowers the Super
visors to make such rules and regula
tions with reference to the mode, man
ner and iirocedure in case of such
appeals as it may deem proper. The
action of the Board of Supervisors on
such appeal shall be final and con
clusive, and until such appeal be dis
posed of there shall be a stay of pro
ceedings in the matter unless other
wise determined by the Board of
Supervisors.
The amendment was referred to the
Charter Amendment Committee.
Several months ago Hocks intro
duced an ordinance making the Su
pervisors a court of appeal when
saloonkeepers were refused a permit
by the Police Commission, but City
Attorney Long rendered an opinion
that the ordinance would be illegal
unless the charter is amended.
Braunhart also submitted a pro
posed charter amendment providing
for a fifty years' lease of any real
property of the school department not
required for school purposes, on con
dition that a building to cost 40 per
cent of the apraised value of the lot
be erected thereon. The amendment
is designed to grant a favorable lease
of the Lincoln School lots, which are
valued at $2,500,000, thus allowing
for a $1,000,000 structure thereon.
Demands were drawn in favor of
several property owners who conveyed
lands to the city for the Golden Gate
Park and Presidio extension.
The District Council of Painters
filed a protest against the members of
the Fire Department painting an en
gine-house on Bush street, which, it
is claimed, is not part of their duties.
Resolutions to the memory of the
late John S. Bannermann, a former
assistant clerk of the board, were
adopted.
After hearing a number of sup
porters of and protestants against
the establishment of a tannery on
Berkshire street by John Honold. the
board, by a tie vote, failed to pass the
ordinance granting him a permit to
operate an engine and boiler in his
place.
GOLDFIELD HAS
STRONG RIVAL
The Searchlight District of Southern
Nevada Proves a Rich Field
for Investors.
While there is no dearth of mining
news from Tonopah, Goldfield and Bull
frog districts, it is seldom that any re
ports regarding extensive operation!? fur
ther south in Nevada are available. The
Searchlight district is one from which
very little news is permitted to come, foi
the reason thsÂ»t it is one of the most con
servative mining communities in the
world, but it is also one of the most pro
lific and progress* iv-- Mr. \MÂ» J. Rouse of
Los Anjfelep. who nas been operating in
the Searchlight field for some time past,
was in the city yesterday and, among
other things said of Searchlight:
"Searchlight is the southernmost of
all thn mining camps in Nevada and Is
located about 10 miles east of the Cali
fornia line and 14 miles from the Colo
rado River. It has passed through the
experimental stages, and the companies,
now operating there are all upon a sound
business basis.
"Alxiiit a year ago. through the efforts
of Benjamin McCready. F. J. Harrington,
Frank Spare, Fred Colton and other large
operators, the Mine Operators' Associa
tion was formed and it now dominates
the entire Searchlight district. The
method of the association is simple. The
union scale of wages is paid for all work
and eight hours constitutes a shift. No
miner, whether he be union or non-union,
can obtain employment in any of the
mines of Searchlight district unless he
first receives a card from M. E. Paddock,
secretary of the association. This card
certifies that he is a competent workman
in his line and a man of good habits and
character.
"The companies now operating in
Searchlight are: Quartette Mining Com
pany, Duplex Mining Company, Good
Hope Mining Company, Searchlight Min
ing and Milling Company, Southern Ne
vada Mining Company, Pompeii Mining
and Milling Company, Boulder Mining
and Milling Company, Saturn Mining
Company, Mondamon Mining Company,
Peerless Mining Company. Enterprise
Mining Company, Cyrus Noble Mining
Company. Santa Fe Mining Company.
"The Quartette is conceded by mining
experts to be one of the greatest, if not
the greatest, gold mine properties in the
Southwest. Their ore is of very high
grade, running as high as $1350 per ton
and is practically free milling. They are
operating a twenty-stamp mill continu
ously and their shipments of bullion are
said to.be better than $60,000 per month.
F. J. Harrington, one of the most experi
enced mining superintendents of thfl
country, is in charge of the work.
"The Duplex and Good Hope properties
are also of great value and are operated
by Fred Colton and A. L. Glassell.
"The Searchlight Mining and Milling
Company, of which George Meyers is
president, is taking out $15,000 to 520,000
per month bullion, and the Southern Ne
vada is doing even better.
"The Boulder Mining and Milling Com
pany have made a radical departure in
operations in thfl Searchlight field by
sinking entirely through the wash on the
flat at the foot of the range. They have
struck some very high values, and at
about 120 feet have opened up two ore
bodies of very large extent.
"The Peerless. Pompeii, Mondamon.
Santa Fe and a number of other compa
nies are operating steadily and with most
satisfactory results.
"Searchlight is a deep field and is not a
poor man's camp. In but very few cases
have values worth mentioning been
found at or near the surface â the notable
exception being the Blossom, owned by
the Southern Nevada Company, from
which $310,000 of bullion was taken in a
few months almost from the grass roots.
As a rule profitable values are not en
countered under 50 to 100 feet and good
values at 200 or better.
"There are now in the district one twen
ty-stamp and three ten-stamp mills, all
of which are operating continuously day
and night. There are no Idle men in the
camp and none of the common garnblins
devices so usual In mining camps Tha
community is a thoroughly orderly one,
operating mines are thoroughly estab
lished and Searchlight is, without excep
tion, the most model mining camp any
where in the Southwest."

NO MONEY FOR GRANEY
Finance Committee Declines
to Recommend Payment of
Demands for Horseshoeing
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
finally passed the ordinance granting
a franchise to the Santa Fe Railroad
Company for certain industrial track
privileges in the Potrero to connect
with its main system. Supervisor
Connor explained that the claims for
damages had been settled and the
linal passage of the bill was in order.
Edward Graney's attorney appeared
before the Supervisors' Finance Com
mittee and urged that some action be
taken on the demands of his client,
aggregating: $4293 75 for shoeing
horses of the Fire Department. The
committee declined to discuss the sub
ject at length and filed a report with
the board to the effect that it refuses
to recommend the payment of the
bills. After the contract to shoe the
horses was awarded to Graney by the
Fire Commission the committee served
notice on the commission that it
would not pass any demands submit
ted by Graney for the work. In all
likelihood a suit will be commenced
by Graney to determine his rights in
the matter. Graney's attorney be T
came somewhat excited in pressing his
claims, saying that the Supervisors
were negligent of their official duties
in failing to act on the demands. He
said they were simply servants of the
people and their power in the matter
was purely ministerial.
City Attorney Long advised the Fi
nance Committee in an opinion that
the amendment passed by the Legis
lature increasing the salaries of the
Justices of the Peace of San Francisco
to $3600 per year became effective on
April 15. Long says he fails to find
any prohibition in the law against in
creasing the compensation of Justices
of the Peace during their term of of
fice and that they are State officials
and not controlled by the provisions
of the city charter.
Property owners on Corbett avenue
petitioned the board to purchase the
land necessary to extend the thorough
fare from Douglass street to Clara
avenue.
The Police Commission petitioned
the Board to purchase a gasoline
launch for the use of the harbor po
lice.
The petition of the Health Board
that certain streets in Chinatown be
repaved was referred to the Finance
Committee.
The proposed ordinance granting a
permit to the American Laundry Com
pany to operate an engine and boiler
at Church and Reservoir streets was
referred to the Fire Committee.

THE GROWTH OF OAKLAND.
*-pHr CAT. I. ha? been watchful of the progress made by our neigh
; boring city of Oakland. Indeed, it has sometimes seemed that
* a? an outsider we discerned more clearly than our neighbors of
v the signs of quickening and growth. It seemed inevitable
growth must respond to the increase in facilities furnished by
tensive system of street and suburban electric roads, and the
I new ferry system. Those who think that things
Selieved that the interurban electric roads would get only
patronage they could lure from the steam roads already con
2 the same points, and that the new ferry would carry only the
that it could take away from the three existing Southern
rries. The observed facts are, however, that the steam
diminution in patronage, nor do the three old ferry
If all of the present traffic were thrown upon either the
ftrk lines and the new ferry, or the old systems which they sup
ment. either would be swamped in the rush until it could far
re than duplicate its capacity. This can mean only one thing,
that is a large and steady increase in the population.
We recently applauded the revelations of the assessment in
ramento County, which proved that hundreds of new homes had
â¢ a founded there, occupied by new families, each contributing to
â¢ nomic forces of the county, and doing its share in producing
S ming. We venture to say that a like showing will be
m other Sacramejito Valley counties and throughout the San
-quin. This increase in the rural population had its complement
the increase of city population. San Francisco feels this and
pulsation of her commercial arteries manifests the force of
nev and new energy.
iently Oakland did not set her house in order in vain. While
pioneers of her street transportation system suffered losses, they
the result of miscalculation of the time that would separate
from cause. Their enterprise was a cause, and increase in
tion is the effect. We don't know what the assessment there
show in new homes and families, nor whether such direct sta
â a-ill be available. But even casual observation shows that the
â  which Joaquin Miller said "the city of the Caesars could bo
t," is being rapidly occupied and improved. To observation may
added the evidence of indirect statistics. The last report of the
Contra Gofta Water Company, recently filed, shows that during the
last year that company made 1376 new water connections in Oak
land alone, which shows an increase of about 6000 in the population.
at is a healthy increment, and carries with it a cheerful rise in
realty values and' an industrial expansion most significant. The in
* rease in population and industries and business in Oakland is also
>\vn by the solidity and soundness of the banks, and their increase
in number and in business. The old established ones show a steady
in and rising profits that can come only from a growing business
munity, and, while they do not appear to feel the presence of
the newer banks, these are growing in response to the general in-
in business activity and industrial energy.
1 one expects that the day will ever come when San Francisco
and Oakland will try conclusions for business primacy, for the
reason that they form practically one business community, separate
m their civic organization. Their contribution to foreign and
â¢nestic trade is a joint contribution and what one gets is not a loss
4he other. Oakland has extraordinary advantages, scenic and com
mercial. Upon the enlargement of her harbor facilities depends the
retention of important trade for San Francisco Bay, which growth
may force off the docks of San Francisco. It is no dream that we
may see ocean liners docking on the east side of the bay,*as they
ck in Jersey City and Hoboken, to get facilities denied by the
crowded wharves of New York. The prospect rouses no solicitude
in San Francisco. Proper business policy means such an access of
nmerce as will need the use of all the deep water front that is
'nd on the bay. Such expansion will not obsolete any facilities
.t now exist, but will only be evidence that they have reached
;r final capacity, and that the trade they cannot accommodate Is
ay in this seaport and not seek another.
Those who want to get the advantage of coming and continued
growth may well turn their attention to Oakland, Berkeley and Ala
meda. In some localities the expansion is to be expressed by the
growth of residence communities ; in others by both residence and
1-usiness, finance and industries.
San Francisco appreciates the privilege of having enterprising
neighbors and stands ready to encourage and applaud, not only the
vvth of Oakland, but to appreciate the building of every new farm
house and the tillage of every newly plowed acre in the great and
fertile valleys which lie beyond. It is all our hinterland and no city
in the world has a richer or greater.
I"""* REE employment offices is one of the subjects of study in the
I""* latest number of the Massachusetts labor bulletins. That State
*â¢ has no free offices, but the question of instituting them has been
advocated for some years, and in 1904 a report was made to the
Legislature by the Labor Bureau in pursuance of a legislative act
directing the bureau to consider the matter. In that report opera
tions of free agencies for the year 1904 are reviewed, covering twelve
r.tes in which they are in successful use. The reports show a big
demand for the services of the offices, both by employers and those
seeking work, a great accomplishment in filling positions and a re
markably low cost for the work of providing the unemployed with
places.
The most notable of these showings is made by Washington.
There is no State law there providing for such offices, but the
bureau was made a branch of the Civil Service Department under
the supervision of the Commissioner of Labor Statistics. The bureau
had 21,758 applications for help, filled practically all of them, and
the cost was only 6.36 cents per position filled. That must be one
of the best records ever made at solving the problem of the unem
ployed. Ohio was the first State in the Union to establish free
employment offices. Its law was passed in 1890, and has been
amended to 1904. Last year the applications for help far exceeded
the supply of applications for situations â 23,047 to 19,333. The posi
â¢ns filled were 15,975. The cost per position filled was 81 cents.
In New York there are practically few applications for skilled
workers from the employers because the workmen in that State are
thoroughly organized and have their own employment bureaus.
There the number of applications for help was 4542, and the calls
for situations were 6650. All the applications for help were sup
plied, and the cost was $1.08. In Missouri the applications by em
' yers far exceeded the applications for work â 36443 to 15,942. In
It State the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is
very much*pleased with the free offices. He says that their suc
cess fully justifies the wisdom of their creation and that "which was
<tt first only an experiment has become one of the most useful
branches of the department." There is a remarkable difference in
the cost of filling positions in the East and the West. In the East
ually a little over a dollar, while Kansas, Minnesota, Montana
and Nebraska get the work done for, respectively, 31^4 cents, 39
cents. 17 cents and 20 cents.
In summing up the study the Massachusetts Bureau says: "The
offices are gaining the public confidence year by year, inasmuch as
they -Acre fulfilling the needs for which they were established."

LABOR STUDIES.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL". TUESDAY, APRIL 25, 1005,
A SOCIETY SCRUBWOMAN
THE little German girl was not at
all sure that she was going to like
the work in the great South Side
mansion. The butler was a state
ly individual who glared at her as she
went about her duties. His impress
ive voice and more impressive manner
quite overawed her. She feared to ask
him the simplest kind of a question,
even when she knew that to do her
work thoroughly she must know the
answer.
The cookâ no, the chefâ was a
Frenchman, who understood no Eng
lish. Then, too, he was so occupied
with his culinary triumphs that he
had no time to notice the little flaxen
haired girl who sometimes watched
him. The little German girl was quite
unaware that this was a pose of the
chef and that he was quite conscious
of his audience.
The housekeeper, who had engaged
her, was a masterful woman, with
whom conversation except on matters
relating to the work was quite im
possible. The coachman and the foot
man were quite out of the ken of the
new maid and she languished for a
little human companionship.
One morning, after a particularly
chilly interview with the methodical
housekeeper, the Mttle girl came down
stairs with the determination to seek
a situation in some household that
would be less elegant and more con
geniaJ. She passed a little woman who
was down on her knees polishing the
hardwood floor of the hall without
paying any attention to her. She
thought that It was deaf Ellen until
the woman spoke to her.
"Does that look perfectly clean to
you?" she asked, as she surveyed her
work critically.
"Oh, yes," said the little girl, glad
of the opportunity to talk to the new
cleaner. "Only this corner still must
be gone over."
"Yes, I haven't come to that yet,"
was the woman's comment, promptly
followed by a vigorous rubbing of the
offending place.
"How long have you been here?"
asked the little German girl.
"Here? About fifteen minutes, I
think."
"I mean in this place."
"Oh!" The woman looked sharply
at the girl. Then she continued: "I've
been here ever since the house was
built."
MIRROR OF DAME FASHION.
SMART BOLERO BLOUSE.
Many possibilities are shown in this smart blouse, where lace, crepe
de chine and satin are all used. There is a fitted lining, over which the
bolero of lace is disposed, this edged all around with a bouillonne band
having deeply corded edges, this in the crepe. The collar and chemi
sette are likewise of the lace, and a very piquant touch is afforded in
the use of a mandarin blue satin to simulate waistcoat revere inside of
the bolero below the neck, and also to furnish the deep swathed girdle
that rounds downward in the front. The sleeve is entirely of the one
seam crepe de chine and is simply a series of three puffs, separated
by narrow bouillonnes, each having corded edges. A lace frill makes a
pretty finish below the elbow. As a design for remodeling this has
many points of excellence.
CAST YOUR OPTICS OVER THESE AND MARE UP YOUR MIND TO BE CHEERFUL

Mrs. Knowsitt â I love to read;
I'm so fond of fairy stories. Do

Mrs. Wise â No; but my hus

"Is that a very long timer*
"Twelve years."
"Will you tell me what the family
are like? You know I work downstairs
and I have never seen any of them."
"Is that bo? "Well, there are not
many of the family here now to tell
of. All the sons and daughters are
married, and only Mr. and Mrs.
are left."
"What is she like?"
"She is a woman about my size,
with gray hair â and there isn't much
more to tell of her."
The little German girl looked her
disappointment. "She must be a grand
lady," she said, "a princess, to live in
such a grand house, and do nothing
all day."
"Oh, but she does a great many

WHAT WAS FOUND
IN THE LEMON
PIES.
Three lemon pies bought from the
shelves of downtown restaurants were
analyzed in the office of the State Food
Inspector, and this is the composition
of the filling of one of them, as an
nounced by the chemist, says the Chi
cago Record-Herald.
"Starch, in thick, firm paste, fla
vored slightly and very little acid; 21
per cent sugar. Aniline coloring
(methyl-orange group). The color is
made synthetically from aniline, and
aniline from coal. Method â di-methyl
aniline on diazo-benaine-sulphonic
acid. Methyl orange Is poisonous in
large doses. Found to contain very
little flavoring and acid from lemon.
Filling of starch paste, sugar and col
ored deep yellow."
In plain English, it was explained
by the chemist that aniline is used in
stead of eggs. The butter was ne
glected altogether and the lemon juice
was slighted.
Another lemon pie was beginning to
decompose when it was delivered to
the laboratory. There was dough at the
bottom. The third lemon pie ex
amined was said to be tolerably good.

day evening. It was resolved to peti
tion the Board of Public Works to
recommend an appropriation of $12,
000 In the budget for the next fiscal
year to build an engine-house on
Twentieth and Connecticut streets. In
the last budget we were granted $4000
for this house and $500 for a company
for one year, but the Board of Pub
lic Works says that nothing can be
done with $4000, hence our petition
for $12,000. If the $12,000 is granted
there will be no further excuse, as the
Real Estate and Development Com
pany has given a lot 50x100 feet free
of charge for twenty years as a site
for the engine-house we are so much
in need of.

things," protested the woman who was
cleaning the ffoor.
But the little German girl laughed.
"Why should she do anything?" she
demanded. "Well, I must be going
down to the laundry now. Will you
not come down and see some time?"
"Yes," said the woman. "I shall
come down to see you soon."
That afternoon the second girl from
upstairs came down into the laundry.
"The old lady is coming on her
rounds," she said, "and you'd better
have everything as clean as you can.
She is a perfect crank on having
everything spotless. She will go and
do it herself if it doesn't suit her."
The little German girl looked
around her anxiously. That the grand
lady of the mansion should come down
to the laundry did not quite coincide
with her Ideas of greatness. Still, did
not the German Empress go into her
own kitchens? At any rate, the lady
of the mansion should find that every
thing was glistening with cleanliness.
She kept her iron moving mechanically
over the same spot as she watched
the stately figure of the housekeeper
coming down the stairs. Behind her
was the woman who had been cleaning
the floor.
"We have a new girl down here, Mrs.
," the housekeeper was saying.
Mrs. ! It was the lady of the
mansion!
"Yes, I was talking to her this morn
ing," said the woman. "You see,"
she said to the still amazed little girl,
"I have come down to see you as I
promised."
And the little German girl has not
yet recovered from the eccentricities
of a society leader who will clean

THE SMART SET
SALLY SHARP
The opening event of Easter week
was the chrysanthemum card party
given yesterday in Sorosis Hall.
This auxiliary has done and is doing
such noble work in behalf of the Chil
dren's Hospital that it is deserving of
the highest praise. Yesterday a veri
table bower of beauty presented itself
immediately at the crossing of the
threshold, maids and matrons in their
bright gowns of Eastertide making a
beautiful picture as they grouped
about the several tables. Bridge and
five hundred occupied the day, at the
close of which exquisite prizes fell to
the highest scorers. And a word here
is due the public spirit of leading
merchants for their choice donation
of valuable articles as prizes. Miss
Rachel Hovey, president of the Chrys
anthemum Auxiliary, Is an energetic
worker in the cause of the Children's
Hospital and speaks cordially of the
acquiescence to requests from every
quarter. Aside from the charitable
object of yesterday's gathering, real
enjoyment manifested itself in so
ciety's reunion after the weeks of
quietude, and the affair has accrued
to the auxiliary at least 1300.
The Marguerite Auxiliary tea and
fair to be held at the horns of Miss
Edna Davis is deferred from next Sat
urday, the 29th, to the following Sat
urday, May 6. A preponderance of
events for the former date has made
the postponement advisable. The
Marguerites are also assiduous work
ers in behalf of the Children's Hos
pital and will derive much aid from
the public, that is always responsive
to call from this charity.

THE STOKES-PASTOR LOVE MATCH
It Contains the Elements of That State of Purity
Toward Which the World Is Turning.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
THE romance of Phelps Stokes and Miss Rose Pastor offers a valuable
comment upon the question of spiritual affinities, which has so strong a
hold upon the popular imagination.
Here we have apparently a case of pure spiritual affinity. The wealthy
New York settlement worker and the attractive Jewish girl. wHb had spent
her young womanhood rolling cigars in a cigar factory and in writing moral
istic articles for the Jewish Daily News, worked together and loved each
other on a plane so highly idealistic that their relation was one of mutual
worship, resembling in no way the conventional courtship.
Both lovers declare that from the first the union of their souls was so in
evitable and so complete that the idea of proposal, engagement, marriage,
occurred to neither, until such a natural course of conduct was suggested
to them by the questions of friends.
"It is like Kipling's Brushwood Boy," declared Mr. Stokes, "and that is
not quite right either, for we are more than affinities. We are, in fact, one;
or, rather, two heads with a single spirit."
I do not believe that it is an uncommon circumstance for a man and
woman to be so sympathetic spiritually and intellectually that their rela
tionship is unaffected by worldly considerations, and untouched by any con
sciousness of sex. Platonic friendships exist to-day which are quite as beau
tiful as were any of those famous ones which nourished In the Renaissance.
There is, however, one condition necessary to their growth; there must be no
interference from outsiders, who may suggest t0 the i OV ers that, after all,
they are not really little children, but. Instead, are man and woman-
Literature which deals with the life of New England during the last cen
tury makes frequent reference to long, long courtships, la which it does not
seem to occur to the man in the case that he should ask the woman whom
he has wooed for years to wed him until he is spurred on to do so by a sud
den fear of losing her.
Although recognized as sweethearts by the community in which they
lived, such couples were satisfied to remain just sweethearts for the better
part of their lifetime. How simple-minded such affection appears from that
familiar story of the New England swain who waa so much agitated fry a
friend's hint that he ought to marry the lady whom he had courted for twenty
yearsâ for, as he said, he did not know where he would go to spend his
evenings if he did so.
The Stokes-Pastor love story Is more human and more practical than any
such coid-blooded romance as this can be. It shows us lover* who wor
together, transmuting their mutual love into enthusiasm for their chosen life
work for humanity.
It Is a love story which contains the elements of that new Edenie state
of purity toward which the hopes and dreams of the world are ever turn
ing. For its love is buUt upon an enduring foundation; it is a lova which
Is unlikely to be endangered by any fear of change. It Is a love that looks
upward, not downward, and enters its earthly heaven with a simple, chili
like heart.

piano playing: as has appeared here
In some time. His performance, at
times brilliant, has an even excellence
all through that pleased without
greatly exciting his auditors. The
compositions were of the class rather
to while away the evening than to
move the emotions. Some of them
were very clever in conceit, especially
"The Swallows." A gavotte was char
acteristic. An etude in D flat gave
opportunity for the display of Mr.
Driver's skill as a performer and also
furnished a satisfactory rest of his
cantabile playing, which Is his strong
point. Altogether the recital made a

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 25, 1005.
MISS CALHOUN
CITES HER AID
Will Produce "Ramona" at
Alhambra for Benefit of
Landmarks League Cause
HER OFFER A BIG BOON
San Antonio de Padua to Be
Roofed Anew, Its Walls
Being Already Rebuilt
SALLY SHARP
Really Califnrnians are not so bad
as they're painted.
They do love and revere their beau
tiful old missionsâ away down deep In
thoir hearts â even though they haven't
demonstrated their love to any mad
degree.
That they love their old missions
â the heirlooms of a picturesque past
â was touchingly demonstrated yester
day.
Learning that the Landmarks
League was struggling hard to dig up
funds to complete the roofing of Mis
sion San Antonio de Padua (Monterey
County), and to provide a care-taker
for Mission Dolores, Miss Virginia Cal
houn, author and leading woman of
the "Ramona" production, generously
offered to present her beautiful play
to help raise the funds that are needed.
"Ramona" to be played for the pur
pose of restoring old San Antonio!
Think of that! â could anything be
more eternally fit?
And played too, by a daughter of
California, who has been reared 'twlxt
the missions of Ban Jose and Santa
Clara and saturated with their history
and romance.
Poor old San Antonio, the most beau
tiful of all the northern missions, save,
perhaps, San Juan Bautista, had long
been in ruins.
Two years ago the Landmarks
League set to work to save it.
By dint of hard work and almost
miserly economy, the league succeed
ed in raising $1362 in dues and con
tributions. With this, work was begun
and carried on until the funds were
exhausted â the Indian laborers receiv
ing $1 per day (and found), the super
intendent (2 60, all other services, even
those of the architect, being gratui
tous.
Lumber was purchased from a mill
in the mountains â twenty-five miles
distant from the missionâ and recon
struction was carried on until the
walls were completely rebuilt, the
trusses laid and thirty feet of sheath
ing (which will underlie the tiles) put
In place.
Then funds gave out â and the league
was forced to suspend work.
Superintendent Forbes caused the re
built walls to be safeguarded from the
rains, and lumber piled In the old
sanctuary for future use, where it is
lying still, waiting to be lifted into its
place.
All the tiles and the ancient adobes
have been gathered from around the
mission acres, and these, too, are wait
ing â almost begging â to be put back
in their wonted places.
Now, money must be forthcoming
for this patriotic work. Are you going
to help?
Likewise must funds be rustled to
provide a caretaker at Mission Dolores,
which the league desires to have open
to the people â to our children, to tour
ists, to ourselves. We need a place
of quiet reverie. I know of none so al
luring as the romantic old mission of
which Bret Harte sang so sweetly In
the long ago.
Thus does the Landmarks League
welcome the offer of Miss Calhoun of
her pastoral play, "Ramona" â the story
that breathes In every line the tale of
the old missions and of the life that
sprung from them.
Details will follow later, when Con
gressman Joseph R. Knowland. presi
dent of the league, returns from the
Grand Parlor of Native Sons at Mon
terey.
But the facts known are these: On
the evenings of May 5 and 6 (Friday
and Saturday) and the afternoon of
Saturday performances will be given
at the Alhambra Theater, the Land
marks League to be the beneficiary for
the purposes named.
And every loyal Califoralan who
truly loves his State will appoint him
self a committee of one to make the
affair a stupendous success.
Let it not be said of us furtherâ as
It is said daily by Eastern and Euro
pean visitors â that we have no concep
tion of the value of our missions â
commercial or esthetic.
Let us prove that we love them by
taking care of themâ that's the kind of
love that counts.
More news to-morrow. But tell this
to your friends. "Wake them up!

HEAVY STORM
IN COLORADO
Snow and Water Cause Much
Damage in the State and
Impede Kailway Traffic
RIYEBS RISE RAPIDLY
Landslide in Royal Gorge
Covers Tracks and Holds
Trains for Several Hours
TRINIDAD. Colo., April 84^â Wet,
heavy snow to the depth of two feet
covers this section and the indications
to-night are that the storm is not yet
over. The Purgatory River, which
overflowed its banks last fall and
caused damage to the Santa Fe Rail
road estimated at $600,000, is rising
rapidly and grave fears are entertain
ed that the disaster may be repeated.
Some sections of the road recently
repaired were damaged to-day by the
overflowing of the river.
A small bridge on the Colorado and
Southern Railroad was washed out
to-day, delaying traffic several hours.
Owing to the destruction of the water
main supplying Trinidad the business
section of the city is entirely without
water. The main cannot be repaired
until the river recedes. A temporary
foot and wagon bridge connecting
North and South Trinidad has been
wrecked. Many bad rookalldes are
reported to hays blocked traffic to
day. Telephone and telegraph lines
have suffered considerably.
DENVER, April 24.-^Train service
on practically all roads in Colorado has
been delayed by the storm. A land
slide in the Royal Gorge, on the main
line of the Rio Grande, covered the
track and delayed traffic for several
hours. In the Cripple Creek district
the snowfall was extremely heavy
and trains were operated with great
difficulty.
GALLUP, N. M., April Si. â Ko
through trains have run In either di
rection on the Santa Fe for the past
twelve hours and the prospects for re
pairing the break in the line between
Blue Water and Grants are very poor.
It is believed here that it will require
at least two days to restore through
traffic. The track for nearly half a
mile is washed out and the work of
repairing the break will be delayed
until the storm abates. It has been

DR. THORNBURGH
UNDER ARREST
Trip to San Jose With Mrs.
Baxter Leads to Charges
Preferred by Husband
DENIES ACCUSATIONS
Says Woman Went With
Him of Her Own Accord
and That He Is Not Guilty
Dr. Herbert T. Thornbtxrgn, for whom
Charles Baxter swore out warrants of
arrest several days ago on charges of
forgery and threats against life, was
arrested last night by Detective Tom
Gibson and is detained at the City
Prison with bail fixed at $3000 for each
offense.
Thornburgh formerly lived with the
Baxters at their flat, 1434 Hyde street.
During that time, Baxter alleged,
Thornburgh tried to wreck his hornÂ«
by winning the affections of Mrs. Bax
ter. Falling in his attempt, the hus
band alleges, Thornburgh, by means
of threats, indnced Mrs. Baxter to ac
company him to San Jose. She re
turned home to her husband the next
afternoon.
It is also alleged by Baxter that
Thornburgh forged his name to checks
and secured money on them.
When seen last night at the police
station Thornburgh had the following
to say:
"These charges are all rot. It Is true
that Baxter's wife went with me to San
Jose, but she went there of her own
accord and I think she will so state at
the time of the trial. At the present
time I have little to say. I worked for
Baxter who, by the way, is not a physi
cian, although he titles himself 'doctor.'
I have been very friendly with his wife
for some time. When my attorney
gives me permission I will talk, but
not until then.
"The cheoks they allege are forgeries
were drawn by me with the permission
of the office and of Baxter. The latter
told me that if ever I got off on a little
'spree' and needed any money I could
use his name and I accordingly did so."
IiOOAIi PRINTERS NOT AFFECTED
BY ACTION OF KANSAS UNIONS
liberal Clerks Consider Plan to Work
Extra Hoar, Giving Laborers
Chance to Buy.
Local printers are now bound to the
eight-hour schedule and the communi
cation lately received from the Ty
pothetae requesting a conference re
garding hours and wages of the craft
is causing deep interest. The members
of the San Francisco Typographical
Union think their employers want them
to agree to a new schedule before the
international's goes into effect.
No newspapers are involved in the
contention, as only the Job printing
houses are Interested in this move
ment. The employers of Kansas C4ty
were the first to meet and adopt mea
sures to disrupt the International
Union.
The Retail Clerks' Union is discuss
ing the advisability of working one ex
tra hour so the laborer can make pur
chases after 6 o'clock. This will help
the out-of-town stores, but the matter
will not be settled until May.
The Boxmakers' and Sawyers* Union
has agreed to hold its annual ball Juns
17 in Native Sons' Hall.
The Laborers' Protective Union has
decided to hold its picnic May 7. The
committee which has charge of the
Labor-day parade meets Tuesday
evening and takes charge of affairs in
behalf of its union.

THE SAN. FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. APRIL 25. iwd.
"PREP" -SCHOOL, BASEBALL.
SCHEDULE IS UNTANGLED
Protests Are Decided, Giving the
Various Teams Knowledge of
Their Respective Positions.
The tangle Into which the baseball
schedule of the high schools in the
Academic Athletic League had drifted
was formally straightened by a com
mittee appointed by the organization
last evening at a meeting held at thÂ«
Cogswell Business College. Five pro
tests had been filed by various schools
and the decisions will materially affect
the final score.
The SL Matthew's Military Academy
protested against the Palo Alto Hleh
School in its contest in which St.
Matthews was defeated, on the erround
that Bransneld, a player of Palo Alto,
was not duly registered according to
the association. The settlement of this
question was referred back to the
schools in question, as it was a matter
of scholarship.
Lick players disagreed as to the right
of the Lowell High School to claim a
victory over them as the game had not
run the required number of innines.
The settlement of this question was
one involving extremely careful de
liberation on the part of the officials
and the decision was reserved until a
later date.
Lowell was again Involved in a pro
test of its own in which she claimed
that in the game when Polytechnic
outclassed it they played a man who
was not eligible and who had been duly
protested. Lowell was given the de
cision.
Alameda and Berkeley high schools
were in trouble over an unsatisfactory
game which terminated in the fifth in
ning with Berkeley slightly in the lead.
In order to get another trial Alameda
based its argument on a portion of
the league constitution which had been
violated by the representatives of the
college town. The committee in order
to allow fair play called the former
contest canceled and declared the con
testants must replay the game from
the start.
9
Mr. Michels, chairman, and Messrs.
Reeves and Boobar comprised the com
mittee. Lick was represented by Cap
tain White, Manager Snell and Mr.
Barieau. Lowell was supported by
Messrs. Johnson, Claybrough and
Tompkins. Polytchnic depended ur>on

PORTLAND. April 24.â Nine fat runs
to four for the Angels gave the game
to the home team to the entire satis
faction of a big crowd this afternoon
at the Vaughn street grounds. It was
not good baseball. Essick was a bit
wild and after working up to the sixth
and part of that inning he was re
placed by Garvin, who finished the
game.
Three innings passed without a score.
In the fourth, Acting Manaiter
Schlafley poked one into center. House
holder advanced him to second and he
scored on McLean's long drive to left,
which Ross failed to handle. Flood
fumbled and Atz was safe. Runkle hit
past the infield and McLean scored.
The Angels hopped on Essick in their
half of the fifth. Cravath got a two
bagger and Robs singled. Cravath
scored. Runkle Juggled Eager's drive
and dropped a skyscraper from Ber
nard and two more runs came in. With
two down. Householder singled and
came home on McLean's wallon. Atz ,
was struck by a patched ball and stole
second. Gray got tangled up with one
that Runkle bumped. He threw wild
to Dillon and two runs crossed the :

JURY MAY RAID
AMATEUR BOUTS
Will Decide To-Day Whether
or Not Hawthorne Club's
Fights Will Take Place
McDonald testifies
"Bough House" Converses
With Foreman Andrews on
Subject of Fistic Lore
To flight or not to flghtâ that is the
question that is agitating the officials
of the Hawthorne Club. Julius Kahn,
representing the Hawthorne Club and
âit is whisperedâ all the "amateur
clubs," says the goes will come off.
Foreman Andrews of the Grand Jury
says nothingâ for publication. There
fore it looks like another raid.
The card with the exception of one
pugilist is O. K-ed by a physician.
One Mr. J. Ennis, who was scheduled
to fight at 128 pounds with George
Sanfranson, refused to submit himself
to medical examination. While in the
pink of condition personally, he as
serted, the delapidated condition of his
hosiery prevented his disrobing his
feet and consequently he was debar
red.
Among those who appeared before
Foreman Andrews was "Rough House"
McDonald, battered veteran of many
an "amateur" go.
"You are old in the business," re
marked Foreman Andrews, "yet you
will box for a $35 trophy."
"I will," replied "Rough House,"
I've got me job as teamster. I'm the
'Amateur Kid.' "
"But lots of fellows as long in the
business as you get $150 a flght," sug
gested Andrews.
"What t' 'ell," exclaimed McDonald
crestfallen. "Well, I tell you I'm the
'Amateur Kid.' "
Then Foreman Andrews had a tete
a-tete with two very young young-
sters, Johnnie Murphy, aged 16, and
Willie Conrov, aged 17. The matter of
age is one of the points that will come
before the Grand Jury at 11:30 to-day
when they meet to decide whether or
not the Hawthorne Club fights will
be permitted.
Foreman Andrews declines to be in
terviewed on the subject, but It looks
like no bouts.
The Young brothers are sparring for
a chance to land on the jury with an
injunction, but the foreman is too wise
to leave any opening. Williara Greer
Harrison and Attorney Peixotto were
called as experts on "amateur" goes
and Foreman Andrews said he gleaned
something that will open the ey*es of
the jury. It looks like a raid.
The Grand Jury investigated the
Coroner's office yesterday and express
ed themselves satisfied with the result.
To-day a committee will inspect the
workings of the Assessor's and Record
er's offices. The committee will consist
of W. J. Bryan, J. H. Speck and
George A. Newhall.
Foreman Andrews will abandon the
attempt to pursuade Adolph Steffens
to confess what he knows about the
ballot box stuffing. Steffens was given
a chance to save himself from San
Quentin by confessing on March 29,
but outside influences were brought
to bear and he cast away the oppor
tunity.

MORRIS LEVY OUTWITS
MANAGER COFFROTH
CAPTURES HIS PET MATCH
Supervisors Waste No Time in Granting
the Coveted Permit for the Bout.
The situation regarding the Britt-
White fight cleared up suddenly and
unexpectedly yesterday, leaving Man
ager Jim Coffroth of the Yosemite Club,
who brought about the match, high
and dry on the shore like some dere
lict cast up by the sea.
Morris Levy of the Hayes Valley
Club was granted the permit for May
by the Supervisors, with the under
standing that he would promote the
Britt- White engagement. Although he
had the Hanlon-Corbett flght on his
hands he took on the other affair.
Charley Mitchell, representing White,
met Willie Britt and Manager â  Levy
last night and quickly reached an un
derstanding. The lightweights are to
meet in Woodward's Pavilion on Fri
day night, May 5. The articles call for
the boxers to receive 50 per cent of the
gross receipts, the winner to receive 60
per cent of this and the loser. 40. Britt
has always scoffed at fighting for this
percentage, so it is fair to presume he
is to receive his 10 per cent bonus out
of the club's share.
There are rumblings from the direc
tion of Nelson's summer home at
Larkspur which portend a disturbance
of some magnitude over under the
shadow of Mt. Tamalpais. Manager
Nolan, who was never called to ac
count for his startling charges recent
ly intimates that he has other revela
tions to make. With the Hanlon-Cor
bett bout scheduled for next month,
the battling Dane is apparently
crowded off the map here, although
he is the one man who can draw a
big house at present, as the public
seems apathetic over the Britt-White
affair.
WEL.CH AS PEACEMAKER.
To Jack Welch, the official referee
of the Hayes Valley Athletic Club, is
given all the credit for straightening
out the tangle. While he said yester
day that he would not referee the
flght it is generally conceded he will
be the third man in the ring when the
battle is fought.
There were so many angles to yester
day's proceedings it is difficult to get
at tlie facts. Manager Coffroth had
one of those smiles on his face last
night that won't come off. He pro
LADIES HOLD CONTEST

University of Californa, will be a 220
yard race, open to members of asso
ciation football clubs only. A medal
will be presented to the winner. As
Andre A. Glarner. the French sprint
er, will not take part, the event is an
open one.
Manager McCreedie Is Suspended.
PORTLAND. April 24. â President
Bert suspended Manager McCreedie
of the Portland team to-day for his
assault upon Umpire Klopf during
Sunday's game. McCreedie played
right field on his team.
Suicide Is Identified.
The young man who committed sui
cide in Golden Gate Park Sunday by
drinking opium poison was identified
at the Morgue yesterday as Rose Fac
tion by R. PTidaux of 9 Powell street.
Prldaux says he doe* not believe this
is his real name, but during the time
he knew him that was what he was
called. Faction, he says, was a resi
dent of Sonora and was interested in a
mine there. He was of a melancholy
disposition.

fessed not to know whether his $1200
license fee would be returned to him
by the Supervisors or whether the ex
pense money he has paid out to bring
White here will rind its way back into
his pocket.
As the fighters had signed to appear
before Coffroth's club to-night, the arti
cles they signed yesterday were dated
ahead to avoid any legal complications-
Contracts seemed to rut no ngure in
the calculations yesterday.
According to one of Coffroth'i friend*
he was given to understand that if a
permit was asked for yesterday by a
club other than the Yosemite Club it
would be granted. One was hastily or
ganized, with Britt Sr. as president and
Sam Berger as secretary and man
ager. A cog slipped somewhere in
the machinery, as a non votes wer*
counted before the board meeting tt
was found that just two Supervisor*
could be counted upon to vote in its
favor.
AGREEMENT IS REACHED.
A conference was held in the ante
room and Britt was shown the over
whelming strength of Morris Levy.
He quickly took in the situation and
an agreement was reached in which
Ci/ffroth apparently cuts no figure.
The matter did not come up until near
the close of the board's session. 3uÂ»
pervisor Eggers then presented a reso
lution and asked that the rutes be sus
pended. It was not referred to the
Police Committee, but was at one*
voted on and adopted.
A meeting was arranged for last
night, when the former articles werÂ«
agreed upon. Willie Britt was in fine
yoke and took advantage of the oppor
tunity to make a long harangue on the
subject of referee. In the club's print
ed articles is a clause permitting the
club to appoint the referee If the bcx
<?rs cannot agree on a man. Britt
he was sure they would agree upon a
referee at their meeting and wanted
this innocent provision stricken out.
Manager Levy said the club's regular
referee is Jack Welch and that he
would appoint him if they did not agr^Â»
on a man. Welch would not act. al
though he felt sure he would if re
quested. The club's second choice
would be Mark Shaughnessy. The box
ers will resume their training to-day.

arrived â¢"â day looking not much the worse
lor her encounter with rhe little schooner Del
Nort*. which rolled on . her beam ends from
the force of the impact. Captain Miller,
master mi the Sea Foam, says It waa dark,
and foggy at the lime of the collision and that
the Del Ncrte had no lights ' out and was
neither ringing a bell nor sounding a fog-
Jiorn. When the schooner ws.s seen It wu too
laic to change the Sea Foam's 'course. He or
dered lull speed astern and the order was
obeyed so promptly that the steamer struck
â¢he sailing vessel a comparatively light blow.
The Del Norte is email, however, and she
rolled over and lay on her beam ends. The
Z <r\ Xcrtes crew launched the schooner's boat
and were taken on the Sea Foam, which stayed
by the wreck until the tug Columbia took hold
of the derelict. - The Del Norte' e crew were

WIMi ESTABLISH PRIMARY
CLASS IN LICK SCHOOL
Board of Education Dot-ides to Give
Relief to Small Children in Noe
Valley District.
The members of the Board of Edu
cation yesterday morning held a con-
ference with the Noe Valley Improve- I
ment Club and the parents of pupils ]
who are dissatisfied with existing ;
school conditions in the district. The |
conference was held at the Noe Valley j
School and after a long discussion
the board decided to establish a pri
mary grade class in the James Lick '
Grammar school for the accommoda
tion of forty small children who would
have too far to walk to the Noe Valley
School. In all likelihood the board
will stick to its previous action pro
viding that the Noe Valley School
shall contain primary Classen only and
the James Lick School be kept strict
ly am a grammar school with the ex

Dr. E. Â£. Dille Would Have It
Restored in the Schools
as Noblest of Literature

Showing: a Big Increase
in' the Criminal Element
"Religion in the Public Schools"
was the subject discussed by Dr. E. R.
Dille in the Methodist ministers' meet
ing yesterday. He said: m
The public school 3yslem stands on the
broJi'.l ground tliat whenever a people under
takes the problem of selr-government it un
dertakes tho problem of universal education.
Since now it is tho fum:!on of the public
schools to give all the education that is neces
sary to makj good citizens, therefore our State
schools shoulj teach moral*.
Will anybody claim that mere intellectual
training will make a good rltizen?
No! A man may be a scholar, and it will
only make him' a DiÃger rascal than if he were
left in ignorance. The tree of knowledge is
not the tree of lite. The finest tempered steel
tjoes into the burglar' s jimmy; a skilled pen
man may become an ingenious forger; a knowl
edge of chemistry nviy make only a skilled
dynamiter. Th.? greater tho training the
greater tho ijeril to society if moral training go
not along with the mental equipment.
What is the moral outlook in our land to
day? .It presents features tnat occasion grave
alarm.
Statistics show that- criminals in this coun
try have increased from one in every 3442 of
the. population in ISf.O to one in every 715 in
1890. .'' Juvenile crime hes also abnormally in
creased. : " - .. 'â  :. â "
Now. what is the cause of this moral de
cadence '.* And what Is thr remedy?
It is wmetimes sal<l tlia; tnis dreadful con
dition is to be attributed to our enormous
foreign population, but a recent article shows
ttia,t of the five geographic divisions of the
United States the two having the most foreign
born inhabitants show the lowest rate of homi
cides, and that foreigners in the United State.;
acquire most of their disrespect for law after
they come among us.
FAILURE TO PUNISH CRIME.
No, these dreadful facts are not to be ex
plained by race or "lima'.e or illiteracy cr by
density of population, or by the foim of our
government. The eauÂ» fees deeper than any
of the?e things.
The cause is complex. It is due in part to
the lamentable failure to punish crime â espe
cially homicidal crime.
In part it is due to the failure to instruct
the young in the principles of morality and
religion.
The fathers and mothers of the land have
sadly neglei-ted their duty, and the church has
n?glecte<l hers when it comes to caring i"or
ehiMhood. And It is pert:y due to the spread
of materialism involving the excessive love of
pleasure and Idolatry of wealth.
Our public schools have no system of moral
and re'iglous instruction.
It is In perfect harmony with our institu
tions that our schools should teach a religiously
grounded morality.
I would not force the reading ol the Bible
and prayer in the public schools if anybody
object; first, because I would not give a
farthing to have a few verses read there per
tuncicrlly, and. second, because the reading
of the Bible and prayer ;s; s worship, and it Is
not in the function pf the State to conduct
worship, and certainly not to conduct, compul
sory worship whether the woihliiier? are little
children cr full grown men.
What I advocate Is the use of the Bibl-e
in the schools, first, as a textbook of literature,
and. second, as a textbook of morals and re
ligion.
First, then. I favor the restoration of the
Bible to our schools as a means ot acquainting
mÂ»r public school pupils with the noblest litera
ture on earth.
, As a nation we are more Intimately con
nected with and oWn more to the literature of
the : Hebrew. than'.' to that of. any other people.
There are more references In our literature. Ten
fold over, to Hebrew than to Greek or Roman
literature. No man can- read and understand
Shakespeare and Milton ana Dante unless he
knows the â . Bible. ; . i' vr '
Our free Institutions are all rooted in the in
stltutlon* of th-- Hebrew people; and an Ameri
can is not truly educatea wno does not knew
ttu- sources of our national life.
Why should not the Bible be a literary text
book In our schools? Because it would be
teaching, not religion, but about religion in
cur public schocls.
RELIGION OF HEBREWS.
But un teÂ«ch our pupils about the religion of
the Greeks and Romans. Among the textbooks
of our hiph school in Oakland is a wcrk on
Greek mythology. And Virgil and Homer are
textbooks there.
Why object to cur knowing atfcut the re
ligion of the Hebrews?
la it a bad ivllgion. a dangerous religion?
To iic.ve dean hands and a pure heart; to do
justly and love mercy and walk humbly befoie
<ji>d â is that dangerois teaching tor the boys
wl:o are to become the future Mayors it
San Francisco, it!" future Supervisors, its fu
ture policemen?
Would not a course In the Ten Command
ments be a good thing for some who hold these
positions now?
I would have the Bible In the public schools
as a textbook of morals and religion, for,
while our schools must not be sectarian, they
must not be Godless.
"Some Instances of Modern Hero
ism" was the subject of an address
by the Rev. Eugene Avery before the
Presbyterian Ministers' Union yester
day morning.
The theme gave the speaker the
opportunity to demonstrate the hero
ism, self-denial and bravery of the
missionary who goes to the savage
with no other weapon than the Bible.
Mr. Avery instanced James Chalmers
and Dr. Grenfel of London, both of
whom proved themselves modern
heroes of Christian faith.
A communication was read from
the Ladies 1 Seamen's Friend Society
announcing that there is to be a rum
mage sale in the first two weeks in
May for the benefit of the society,
which, it was stated, had to change
its quarters owing to the lease having
been riven another association The
society desired that the pastors make
the coming benefit known fro.n their
pulpits.
Dr. J. K. McLean, president of the
State Board of Charities and Correc
tion, appeared before the Congrega
tional Ministers' Union yesterday and
discussed the three classes wriic-h come
under the consideration of the board.
The classes are the "delinquent" who
get into prison; the "defectives," in
cluding the deaf and dumb and blind,
and the "dependent" orphans, aged
and Insane.
The three classes in the State insti
tutions last year numbered 49.873, at
an expenditure of $2,555,000.

â¢ â i â
Leaders in the Army of Loot
May Endeavor to Foment
Labor War on Water Front
Applications , for meml>ership in the
' San â¢ Francisco Republican League
signify that many thousands of -voters
S are ready to support the ! new organ
; ization in its efforts to obtain better
i government . for the city. ' In a few
I days , the league will open permanent
j headquarters at 636' Market street,
1 opposite the Palace Hotel. The ex-
I ecutive committee is 'at i work selecting
1 a finance committee of forty citizens.
i The leaders in the new movement are
i fully : apprised of the fact that Rue*
i and his associates in the- municipal
! campaign of 1903 expended money lav
j ishly to bring about, the election .of
j Eugene E. Schmitz. The Schmitz Cen
i tral Club provided the "sinews " of
i war" in the tenderloin district. The
j practical men in the San Francisco
I Republican League propose to raise
i an ample sum of money to , cover the
expenses of a liberal and legitimate
! campaign to rescue the city ; from the
I legions of loot and graft. The notion
that political battles can be won by
I the adoption of resolutions is not en
1 tertained at league headquarters.
I There is a proposition that a house
to house canvass of the city shall be
made with a view of enlisting the sup
. port of every citizen who desires that
the -city shall be honestly and decently
governed. The executive committee
j will probably know the strength of the
I league in every , precinct Â before _ the
I forces line up at the primary polls.
i Money to meet" the cost of a cam-:
j paign of f this character will be
contributed by the patriotic â ,mc
l chanics, -'â¢ merchants and wage-earn-
I ers of the metropolis. The sentiment
lis * deep and widespread " throughout
San Francisco . that a change in the
; character of the city government must
; be wrought and this sentiment will be
f reinforced with something more than
pleasing platitudes on . purity. It is
practical : politics , for a . campaign
i committee to know in advance of an
j election how many votes each party
I can" bring to the polls.
It is predicted that the Republican
, League will call out a sufficient num
: ber of votes in every Assembly dls-
I trict to elect its delegates to - the
: party nominating convention. There
'is confidence in the league th.at a
ticket representing the industrial ele
ment of citizenship will command the
, support of the great army of wage
i workers, salaried men. merchants and
â  professional men at the general elec
j tion in November. v
I It is an open .question whether the
! grafters : will elect to make a contest
'â¢ against the Republican party 'at . the
' primary polls. Ruef will probably
! make a determined fight in his own
'district to hold a place on the Repub
lican County Committee, if he cannot
by adroit 'manipulation get what . he
j wants without |. fighting, for it. : \ .. *,
' The grafters are now working under
! cover. They are striving to create
: . labor troubles on the water front with
the expectation â > that leaders . in the
army of loot will be called in to adjust
' the difference between employers and
' the employed.,' 'â¢. . :

STOCKS â (Mr. Isâan Mads out tills) â To
Wall street: "Don't cat rattled by Ttrors
Â£ay*a and to-day's flurry. This Is only a tiny
wmil of what is oomlosT. Walt until the?
break 6 points between Quotations and one of
the great lights of financial dominion throws
vp his hand* and tries to ontacgl* a few

the traders to hold their lines steady until my

of Berlin. London and Paris. Then Wall street
Will bare â¢oineUilnr to dance to."
COTTONâ The market to-day was dull and
k*re:y steady, with prices declining about 10
points In tb* early trading on scattered sail
ing. There was also a strong effort to dia
led** the lon*- Interest accumulated In July
and October contracts by the Sully and Wall
street contingent. There was no evidence,
however, of any such liquidation, and later the
market rallied sllrctly on covering of shorts
ar.d some moderate buying. Th* market will
be dependent very largely on the character of
th* weekly Government report and weather
conditions from now on, as affecting th* new
crop situation and outlook. i.rxr* s-J-^r

â¢Nf:w YORK. April 24. â A break In the price
cf- ki â¢â â â *Â«â  to-<3ay sftned a foregone conclusion.
The promise of <?uch â  movement was Â«o clear
thttt profesFional operators cold enough stocks
durlrus the first hour to more than Â«over the '
rÂ»-quirÂ»-nientÂ» and tr.Â°y devoted a period of the
day to covering their short contracts With
iJ?e result of practically repairing the losses.
It Â»m evident that bargain hunters were- also
on hand aafl their -willingness to take stocks
at the break was a rnst^rtal factor in rallying
thp market. The . technical situation pointed
conclusively to considerable liquidation to-day.
The heavy decline of -Thursday last, since
â which time trading on the Exchange haa been
eufppnded. indured a great many calls for
additional margins by the brokers and com*
mission houses. It Â»ac known before the mar
fcet cpened'that these calls had brought back
many responfieE ordering the selling out of
foldings. . Speculative sentiment had been so
' far ehaken by last week's development that
no effective support was to be anticipated un
â -;- at considerable concessions In prices. The
1 Â«venjs of Saturday* wheat market forced the
conclusion that -the attempt to corner the May
eptlon had been â  abandoned and the obvious
conclusion that heavy speculative lor9pÂ« had
been sustained pointed to further liquidation
in stocks as a recuperative, measure.- The
pressure centered upon the stocks which have
rÂ»eÂ«n favorites It) the speculation on account
of the merger stories. Union Pacific leading the
railroad list in point of activity and weakness.
Ivorthern Pacific's re-entry in the market was
the rnai : for - sales down to 165. â  compared
the recently prevailing nominal price of
IKO bid. The prevailing discussion m
stock market circles was of the danger of re
opening hostilities and of competitive projects
In the railroad world, in strong contrast to the
recent abiding faith in the mutual determina
tion of all the great powers of the railroad
vorld to come together and put Into force pro
jects for the common benefit. Thursday's
flurry In the call money market to 7 per cent
had nerved to overthrow the conviction that
the ease of the money market was incapable
ef being disturbed. The bank statement pub
lished on Saturday during the interval of the
trading : sho-wÂ»i"' that loans had continued to
expand in sr it- of thÂ« liquidation in etocks.
The "offering t---<*.ay of $25,000,000 of New York
City bonds made heavy requirements on the
money market. â  Next month the $100,000,000
Pennsylvania bond subscription, an Installment
of all bat ten per cent of the â¢ Japanese loan
â¢nd the withdrawal of an Installment of Gov
ernment gold deposits are to be provided. The
inability of the money market to meet all these
requirements Is decidedly less probable than
the period of advance in prices of stocks. The
sews of the Milwaukee bank defalcation caused
Inevitable Â«nÂ»ettlement again and gave force
to the feÂ«llr.g. of uneasiness as to the effect or
losses la the wheat collapse. The reaction In
price* carried Union Pacific to the lowest of
the day and made a broad Inroad on the re
covery of which had been established during
the middle portion of the day and made the
closing -weak. The remarkable rise 'In the
Lo-ulFv!!!e and Nashville group attracted at
tention to tbÂ« published reports of plans for
the formation of a great trunk line from
Korth to South by a combination of existing
properties. I These stocks relapsed equally with
the rest, of the market in the late reaction.
Great Northern preferred late In the day sold
at â¢ decline -of 21) points from last week, which
may hare helped the late reaction.
. Bonds were Irregular. Total tales, par
Value, $3,085.00Â©.

CHICAGO. April 24.â Wheat for May de
livery sold down to 92'jc a bushel, a ac
crease of 7 %c compared with Saturday's clos
ing quotations. At the close the market had
rallied to !Â«<.-. The sensational .decline to
day, following the . big break, of last week,
was the result of general liquidation par
t!cipated in by John W. Gates, the erstwhile
bull leader. Millions of bushels of May wheat
chanced ownership during the day's exciting
session. At the close of trading it was claimed
by close observers . that aÂ»l of the enormous
line held by the Wall street clique had been
liquidated. The market became - steady , late
in th? day on an Improved demand. Armour
& Co. "belny credited with heavy purchase*
of both the May and July options. . The "slump
in -May created extreme weakness â¢In distant
deliveries. ' the July option closing 'at a net
loss- of ' 2c. Corn, oats and provisions like
wise were affected by the break .In wheat.
May corn being off 1 |4c at 4Â»V at the close.
July corn is down lUc, July oats show a Joss

The break in May wheat began with _/iltidT'

BtiigS6%c. During the first few, minutes Of I
I buslnees Armour & Co. -made an effort '; to I
j give the market - some support, : but traders I
j In general regarded the move merely as an â¢
attempt :to create a higher ' market on which
to dispose .of additional Gates wheat.- Th-Â»
selling was so general and so persistent that !
soon ali efforts to stop the . decline win 1
abandoned. " Everybody â¢ seemed to have; July
wheat for gale and few appeared ' willing -to
1 buy. Before the session was half over-th*
price of May had dropped t002%c. Meantime
' the July option had; sold off. to S4%c. . Many
â¢ traders were' of the opinion that during- the j
heavy Belling 'j early In the session tbÂ» .re- j

! given support by ' Armour & Co. and fresh
â  minors were rile that Gates has associated
j himself with ' Armour for a : bull campaign in
the mere distant : option. -Â' There was - also a
; good general demand, buying being based on
the theory that the price of May haÂ« reached
a level consistent with so-called: legitimate
conditions. TBe fact that May wheat In this
I market . was - selling , at a , lower., price " than at

made I little response. < fluctuations in May dur

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Receipts of Potatoes over Sunday were
heavy, aggregating over 600 sacks, aad, as
trade was rather slack, prices ranged lower.
Oregon Burbanks ' were quiet and cheaper,
while all other descriptions of old Potatoes
were steady, particularly river kinds, which,
owing to their large size, were wanted for the
restaurant trade. Australian Onions were
weak at the flat rate of $5 per cental and new
green were lower.
Most kinds of vegetables were In ample sup
ply and lower prices ruled for several descrip
tions. Tomatoes were extremely scarce and
firm and some Mexicans packed in six-basket
carriers brought $5 per cancer. Desirable of
ferings of Asparagus were cleaned up by the
canners at 4%@{;c per pound.

maintain any po)e or overhead wire in

also makes it unlawful after May 1,

cepting those exempted as follows:
â  In casÂ«s requiring the temporary use of
wires for the purpose of reporting conventions,

occasions of urgent necessity, permits may be
Craned, without discrimination, to any com

â  Auditor Baehr was present at the
meeting of the Finance Committee to
explain his refusal to audit demands
on the City and County Hospital fund
for January and February in excess of.
the one-twelfth act. Warden Fleming
did not appear, although he was noti
fied to be present, and the committee
decided to consider the matter this af
ternoon. The controversy between
Baehr and Fleming is due to the dicis
lon of the Auditor to hold Fleming to
the provisions of the one-twelfth law.
The demands of the two months
named have overdrawn the fund by
$5000. though there is some $7136 avail
able monthly for the last four months
of the fiscal year.
The City Attorney filed an opinion
to the effect that The Star is a.news
paper of general circulation within the ;
provisions of section 4460 of the Poli
tical Code, as amended at the last
session of the Legislature and there
fore the publication of the delinquent
tax list in the paper named would
satisfy the requirements of the Poli- 1
tical Code. The opinion is important
in view of the fact that the paper has :
submitted the lowest bid for printing
the delinquent tax list. The Printing
Committee will consider the matter to
day.

JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Tetrazzini, of the birdy voice and
the slumberous eyes, sat between that
handsome Police Judge. Conlan, and
a gray bearded interpreter and chir
ruped vivacious replies to queries
anent her dealings with Julio Ziegner
Uriburu, formally accused of having
appropriated to his own use 27,000
francs which she had entrusted to him
with instructions that the money be
sent to her creditors in Europe. She
lightly denied that her relationship
with Julio was ever "very friendly,"
and the aim of the defense to show
by documentary evidence that she pre.
varicated was frustrated by the court,
which held that such evidence was
irrelevant, if not both immaterial and
incompetent. Then the diva smiled
bewitchingly at Julio's baffled attor
neys, but cast never one glance at
Julio himself, who moodily stared at
her face and toyed with his raven
mustache.
The documents in question were
I original telegrams and letters alleged
I to have been sent by her to him at
various times and places, despite her
assertion that she did not invite him
to join her in California, and that she
had never treated him other than as
' a casual acquaintance. She had
| known him for ten years and was
I sure she did not first meet him in Lon
don, because she never was in Lon
; don. Did she wire to him from this
city while he was in Mexico and sign
I the dispatch "Luisa Mammita?"
; (Mammita being a Spanish endear
: ment synonymous with mamma.) Ah!
Xo. no. Was she certain she had not
sent such a message? Let her look
at it again. Oh. yes. Ha! Ha! She
did. Then counsel for the unhappy
Julio endeavored most strenuously and
assiduously to read translations of
other missives sent by her to him, but
the bench shut them out. Here are
some of the excluded communications:

â  Mrs. Gross informed. the court that
she was from Kentucky and proud of
it, but did not -permit her ?- pride -of
birth, to lead her to the extreme of
monopolizing^ the yard lor even at
tempting to do so. Mrs.': Lyons did
strike her on the jaw, and it was the
I blow that precipitated "her into 'the

FATHER GREY
WINS HIS SUIT
Judge Sloss Holds Venerable
Priest Was the Victim
of Fraudulent Practice
OEDERS GOLD RETURNED
Physician Summoned to Ac
count for Thousands He
Procured by Illegal Acts
Father Peter J. Grey, the venerable
priest, who charged that he was swin
dled out of $40,000 by Dr. Thomas F.
Brennan, has won his case in Judge
Sloss' court. The physician has been
ordered to appear next Monday and
account for the funds he procured
from Father Grey under pretenses of
friendship. The decision of the court
goes into the merits of the case with
out regard for Dr. Biennans feelings.
and he is the target for much ironical
comment Irom the court, who, in part,
says:
Truly a strange promise, this, on which the
defendant relies to justify his taking ov.-r
$40,000 trom this contiding old man on the
mere verbal oromlse to care for him tut the
remainder of his life. I am inclined rather to
the testimony ot Father Grey that he did not
know that hv was signing promissory notes
when he put hia name to the papers presented
him by his irusted advisor. It is evident that
the Tuner's mind is not as strong as it once
was. while tne defendant is in bis prime and
in full possession of mental and bodily vigor.
To say the least the whole transaction has a
very peculiar look.
Taking all the circumstance* of the case to
gether the evidence is nut sufficiently clear as
to that alleged agreement. The transaction
was consummated between the plaintiff and
defendant alone, after the defendant had taken
Father Grey to Paso Rubles. No legal or
other advice was sought for two years after
the transfer. Father Grey continued to con
test tie claim of the Archbishop to the money.
Then he effected v compromise, and yet, ac
cording to the defendant, all that Father Grey
received was property hÂ« had given away.
A very significant fact is that some months
before the defendant went to Faso Robles with
Father Grey he had the priest examined by
Dr. Lustig, an expert on mental diseases, who
told him that Father Gr*y was not so strong
mentally as he had been.
After commenting on the suspicious
nature of this action on the part of
Dr. Brennan, the court continues:
The evidence shows that Father Grey found
Dr. Brennan sick and penniless, and in his
ministrations as a priest relieved the doctor's
needs and brought to his bedside the consola
tions of religion, finally giving him a new
start so that he became successfu' 'n his pro
fession as a doctor.
There can be no question but that a relation
of confidence actually existed between the
plaintiff and tht defendant and this without
regard to the question whether such relation
necessarily flows from the mere fact that one
party is a patient and the other a physician.
There being, then, this relation and the fact
that the plaintiff executed written instruments
to the defendant by means of which the de
fendant obtained a large sum, of mon^y, I
think there can be no question that these
facts bring the case within the well estab
lished rule throwing upon the trustee who has
entereu Into any transaction with his bene
ficiary, whereby he. the trustee, receives any
advantage, the bjrden to show the absolute
falrnecs and Justice of the transaction and
that the beneficiary acted with a full knowl
edge and understanding of the facts.
I conclude that the plaintiff has made out
a case entitling him to a decree declaring the
defendant to be a trustee of the funds drawn
from the Hlbernia Bank and this entitles him
to the further relief of an accounting for the
purpose of ascertaining what the trustee has
done with the funds and wh*re the proceeds
are now.
Whether In any such accounting credit should
he given the defendant for the expenditures on
behalf of the plaintiff and what should be
allow d for services may be considered when
the matter of the accounting is presented-
The fact? upon which Father Grey
6ued Dr. Brennan are these: In 1889
Dr. Brennan secured three orders on
the Hibernia Bank from Father Grey
and two years later, after the litigation
between Father Grey and Archbishop
Riordan was compromised. Dr. Bren
nan drew $37,524 13 from the bank
and placed it to his own credit in the
Anglo-Californian Bank. He followed
the same plan in reference to $4000,
secured from outstanding accounts of
the priest, and finally divided all of
the funds thus obtained among sev
eral deoositories and refused to make
an accounting. Father Grey caused
the arrest of Dr. Brennan on a crim-.
inal charge and during its pendency
instituted suit in the civil courts to
recover the funds. Father Grey has
won his victory- and Dr. Brennan. who
is now in Los Angeles, has been sum
moned to appear next Monday and
tell where the funds are located.

MOTHER FALLS
IN DEAD FAINT
Dramatic Incident Occurs in
Judge Cook's Court During
the McCarthy 3lurder Trial
PKOCEEDLXGS STOPPED
Stormy Scene Caused by a
Brutal Question Followed
by Lie Direct Being Given
An exciting scene occurred in Judge
Cook's court yesterday afternoon dur
ing the trial of Michael J. McCarthy,
charged with the murder of his young
wife, Octavia, at 1424 Market street on
the morning of September 19. Dr.
John I. Stephen, head surgeon at the
Central Emergency Hospital, was be
ing cross-examined by Attorney Reese
Clark as to his treatment of the pa
tient while in the hospital. Clark
shouted: "Why didn't you cu| her
open?"
Assistant District Attorney Ashe
sprang to his feet and protested
against such a brutal question, say
ing that Clark ought to be ashamed of
himself.
Before Stephen could reply Clark
again shouted: "You were expelled
from the Medical Association, were
you not?" and Stephen retorted:
"You're a liar."
The Judge said to Stephen: "I can
not allow such language in court."
and Stephen replied: "I apologize to
your Honor, but not to that man."
Just then the mother of the mur
dered woman fell from her seat in a
faint and was carried out of the court
room by Detective T. B. Gibson and
Bailiff Meinert. Dr. Stephen had to
leave the witness stand and attend to
the woman. The defendant asked
through his counsel that he should be
permitted to leave the courtroom for a
few â¢ minutes, as he was unnerved by
what had occurred, and the Judge con
sented. In a few minutes order was
restored.
The witnesses examined yesterday
were Corporal Russell of the Police
Department, who exhibited a diagram
of the scene of the murder; Dr. I* D^
Bacigalupi, who made an autopsy of 7
the body; Dr. C. A. Glover of the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital; Dr. T. E.
Bailey, visiting physician at St. Mary's
Hospital; Dr. Stephen and others. Dr.
Bailey attended the wounded woman
from the time she was taken from the
Emergency Hospital on October 22. till
December 5, when she died. He said
her death was due to exhaustion, fol
lowing an abscess of the liver and
blood poisoning caused by the gunshot
wound.
Dr. Stephen was examined as to the
nature of the wound and his treat
ment. He removed the bullet on Oc
tober 3 from above the tenth rib and
produced it in court. Later he made
another incision and removed a part of
the rib, which had been fractured. He
assumed the bullet had passed through
the liver.
In cross-examination the defendant's j
attorney attempted to show that Dr.
Stephen was not at the hospital at the |
time Mrs. McCarthy was taken there,
nor was he there all t" it day, but the ,
witness denied It, saying he was there
at the time and personally attended to
her four or five times that day. Then
followed the question as to the witness
being expelled from the Medical As
sociation and subsequent developments.
The case will be continued this morn- \
ing.
MAY STILL USE
WORD "TRUST"
Attorney General U. S. Webb yester
day gave an opinion to the Bank Com
mission to the effect that corporations
administering estates need not elimi
nate the word "trust" in their title,
in accordance with the law pnssed by
the last Legislature, provided such cor
porations were formed prior to the
passage of the law or had taken up
administrations before that time.
The opinion is wf great importance
to the old companies because if it had
been adverse the Bank Commission
would be empowered to collect $100 a
day as a fine from such companies
using the word "trust" in their title
as engaged in administering estate?.
The new law provides that only such
companies as have the actual handling
of estates may hereafter use the word
"trust" in their titles. It designates a
tine of $100 a day following the im
mediate passage of the law, for any
corporation to continue to use the
word.
Miss Braeg Wants Her Hat.
Miss Augusta A. Braeg, 1771 Sutter
street, obtained a search warrant
from Police Judge Cabaniss yesterday
to recover the possession of a hat
which she alleged had been stolen
from her while she was staying at the
Hotel Netherlands on March 21. "I
was in Tait's cafe on Saturday night,"
Miss Braeg told the Judge, and I was
suprised and indignant to see my hat
being worn by Miss Violet Arthur,
who had occupied a room in the Ho
tel Netherlands when I was there. I
could not be mistaken."
Miss Arthur * says she bought the
hat.

SPEEDILY CURED -
BYCUTICURA
'â¢ I had suffered terrible agony and
pain for eight long years from a ter-
1 rible eczema on the scalp and face.
The best doctors were unable to help
me, and I had spent a lot of money
for many remedies without receiving
any benefit. My scalp was covered
with scabs, my face was like a piece
of raw beef, my eyebrows and lashes
were falling out, and sometimes I felt
\ as if I was burning up from the ter-
rible itching and pain. I then began
treating myself at home, and now my
! head and face are clear and I am en-
tirely well. I first bathed my face
with Cuticura Soap, then applied Cv- .
! ticura Ointment to the afflicted parts, <
and took Cuticura Resolvent for the
1 blood. I was greatly relieved after the
first application, and continued use of
Cuticura soon made a complete cure. â
