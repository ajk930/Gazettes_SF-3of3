the Salt. Lake Railroad, Senator Clark's
line between this city and Salt -Lake.'
with reference to existinK railrpads. : It
maynpw be- positively stated that R.
H. Harriman of the Southern Pacific
Is. practically an equal owner In the
property with Senator Clark. That be
ing the case, . It means that the new
line -'will- be simply a j Southern Pacific:
feeder;. under another name and' that
its .construction will in ho wise disturb
easting ' conditions ; with reference" . tc/

-. Senator' Clark .and President Harrt-.
man â¢ have agreed .that each' sfrall be
represented by. two persons in, the con-'
â¢structlon; of the. new .road across the
cpuntry.' Fpf the first named J. Ross
Clark and Engineer William. HawfcobdT
have been' acting, and for Harriman
the construction agents of Chief Engi-'
neer. William Hood.pf the Southern Pa
cific and General Manager Bancroft pf
the Oregon Shprt Line. .The two last
named recently completed an Inspection
pf the graded poxtipn pf the' line and
both have left Los Angeles.
â¢Whether or hot the new road will
become part of the Oregon. Short Line
system or will continue its present cor
porate existence pnly the projectors of
the enterprise know. The presumption
Is the two properties will be managed
separately, as the southern feeders of
the first mentioned road were sold last
year to the San Pedro, Los Angeles and
Salt Lake Railroad. The new line will,
hpwever, give to Harriman two separ
ate feeders into Pomona, as the South
ern Pacific now is in that eft*. "O'C-

cided to go -back to Washington.
He. found :he. did not shave enough
money to pay his. bill and railroad fare.
He did not care to make a check, so; he
walked over* to the little bank on the
public square and told the. aged banker
who he was,;saylhg he desired to make
a draft for $200 on the bank of which
he was president.

The game was ' fast .throughout and
was replete with sensational plays.
The scene of the game was the pri
vate field of F. J. Carolan. The pictur
esque pclo pavilion was crowded during
the afternoon, while many spectators
viewed the game from the side lines.
Mr. Ezra, the European expert,
proved, a tower of strength to the. Reds.
He secured two of the goals for his'side
and was always in action. . ~' < Â»'* :
Through an Inadvertence the first pe
riod extended over eighteen rriinutes o.f
fast play. In this period R. M. Tobin
scored. for the Whites. In the second
period Tom Driscoll sent the ball to the
â¢edge of the goal line, but it did not go
between the posts.' Charley Dunphy re
peated the performance a moment later,
but Lawrence McCreery drove the ball
outside for. a "safety." This -allowed
the Reds â¢ a free stroke from 1 the ; 35
yard L'ne. Mr. Ezra represented the
Reds and. sent 'the ball' between the
post?. This tied the score.
In the third period Dunphy
Vcored after Tom Driscoll had carried
the ball down-tbe field. They repeated
tke performance just at the end of the
period, but as. both were offside- it did
not count. .
T\>ere was some desperate galloping
in tie fourth period. Dunphy and Dris
coll having the other players strung
o'ut b>hind them like the tail of a comet
several times. Ezra scored again In
| this period, making the score 3 to l" in
, favor & the Reds. Tom Driscoll was
j hit on the knee by a ball, but after a
brief res\ he pluckily resumed his place
on the field. y~ He soon added another
; goal to thV Reds' score. " ,, .
Lawrenc? McCreery scored Â¦ for * the
Whites after running the" ball across
the field. The Reds scored their last
goal in the j^xth period. \

Oarsman also rallied under the fierce
Oarsman and Proper were a trifle gay
at the post, but Jake' Holtman finally,
got the nine starters settled,^releasing
the barrier to "a pretty start. Under
orders. Bullrrian went right to the' front
with Fossil. Martin on Proper, dropping
In second! Dainty and Oarsman follow
ing next.' There was J little change
among the leaders -until the ; stretch
was reached, then Oarsman bettered his
position a peg, arid the real struggle
began. Fossil did not show perceptible
signs' of tiring, and -opposite the 'pad
dock with Proper at' his* rider's saddle
skirts, * it Â¦ looked as * if- the 'little ' brown
gelding would win." At this crucial mo
ment Martin drew his whip and ; Proper
responded. 1 :
SENSATIONAL Â¦ 'FINISH, i
Proper had previously rolled up three
consecutive victories, one of them being
his win of the Christmas handicap. .He
was coupled in the betting witn Dainty.
As Proper carried 123 pounds and.Dain
ty 103 it looked a good pair to. draw-to,
and from 11 to 5 the price was grad
ually rubbed to 9 to 5. Oarsman! the
mount of. Jockey Burns, with 119 pounds
up," came" next in demand. Fossil was
considered too small to negotiate 114
pounds, and his price went from 6, to 9.
Claude was'asked* to- carry the same
weight as Proper, but his stock appears
to have taken a slumpin. the market,
for Mike Daly's Derby winner was not
in brisk "demand. 'Â¦ Great things "were
expected of " Divlna, but she disap
pointed again. - l< Â¦ ['Â¦
Just a short nose' separated .Proper
and Fossil at the finish of the valuable
New Year handicap over one and an
eighth, miles yesterday at Ingleside
rate, -course. ' : It -was enough to' clinch
the claim of Walter Jennings' bfg fel
low as being the be9t horse in. train-
Ing, in California. - . :.
It was an exceedingly, close finish â
close . enough , to cause a hush to fall
over the ie.000 spectators - until : the'
number of Proper-was flashed first on
the indicator; Then there was.a mighty
roar arid the fortunate, investors made
a rush- to get In line behind the book
makers' stands. History repeated Itself,
for it was merely another instance o^ a
great big horse.- beating* "a- good , little
horse. "When Jack Martin, astride the
Jennings entry, returned to the win
ners circle,' he was accorded an ova
tion. A second one \ was â¢ given-' John-
Bullman - as he . .cantered ' back to Â¦ the
stand with Fossil.
Â¦ It-wrs a true run race, devoid of ac
cident of any sort. It cost. the. ring
many thousands of dollars, for. the big"
plunders and many of the rank . and
file were down hook, line and sinker on
the winner. }':'Â¦'.. ~/\'T'.

Kerns and Officer Howard to assist him
in arresting Otto Simon.. Simon was
still in his sister's house wheÂ°n the of-'
fleers arrived at 3 o'clock.. He told his
mother and sister he was prepared to
give himself up, and was at the top of
the. hall stairs when. the officers broke'
in the door.. . But when Officer Howard
reached; the top of the steps Simon was
not to be seen. He had made his escape
by means of a back. stairs and eluded
the men guarding .the house outside-
Hugo Chester, a spectator,' thought he
saw. Simon climbingiover a. fence and,
flred two shots at him. Simon managed
to keep out of the clutches of-the-of
ficers until this afternoon when" he de :
cided to surrender. " : ,'.â¢:<* â¢'.
I Allseits was borne, to the home of "Dr.
John U. Oberg at 32S" Ellis" stf eet. It
was found that one : bullet, had' taken
effect, and entering the right side had
passed within^ an inch- df the heart and
lodged tn the" liver. Allseit's recovery
is doubtful. Dr.'O. D. Hamliahad him
removed to the 'Receiving Hospital to
night and an^operatlon was performed
for the recovery of- the bullet. 'J'K'l^l
; â¢ ; : SLOW TO ACCUSE.
Allseits* condition,- due to tne* quan- .
tHy of liquor he drank,-was such- that
he was unable to give *an account of
the shooting. First he charged his com
panion, Martin, with the shooting.- then
his step-brother; and. it was only after
considerable prompting that he said.it
was Simon .who shot him.
"Allseits began the row," said Klmon
at thu County Jail. "He. and his friends
tried to do me up. I. told them I would
shoot if thev touched me, and when
they, persisted I dfew my pistol and.
flrr.d. I did npt run away to escape the
officers,- but in, fear of. the mob, who
had threatened to lynch me." * *
Mrs. .Young , corroborates ' Simon's
story as to the threats mado against
.him. She says she. realized that her
brother 'was in danger when she h*ard
bis voice in the street and hurriel to
assist him. ' '-' .'.
. "It was so .dark .1 .could not aee,'.' she
said, but when I heard the shots I
thought it was my brother who had
been . fired opon. .T-hat ', Is why I ran
down and opened the ddor. My brother
did not intend to run away at all. He
was simply afraid the mob would carry
â¢out its threats to do him harm.'*
Henry Fatthauer, Allseits 1 step
brother, declares that Otto Simon had
two pistols when he began shooting. He
says that. when he took one pistol avay
from Simon the, youth flred again. vith
the other pistol, which he drew ?rom
his coat pocket. " . ,
' "Otto Simon followed us along King
street," he said. "I said to my step
brother. 'He's going to shoot.', With
that I. grabbed Simon and turaed the
pistol he had in his hand a'waf. Then
he pulled another pistol and'' fired -It.
One of the shots hit Minert."/
Allseits is a son of Mrs. \ftlhelmina
Fatthauer of Fulton street" He is a
member of the Glassblowers? Union and
has until lately been employed ,wlth the
California Art Glass Worts. Simon. is
a son of Henry Simon of 2019 Alcatraz
avenue, a coal dealer, with whom he
works. Both young men 'were brought
up in Lorin and were former school
mates. / .
..Allseits came back to Berkeley On
the last train from San Francisco this
morning, arriving at Lorin static-n
shortly after 1 o'clock. Accompanying
him was Harry Martin of San: Fran
cisco, both being heavily under the in
fluence of too much New Year's cheer.
They were armed with a bottle of
whisky and, another of eggnogg. which
they proceeded to consume on t"he way
down to the Lorin flrehouse.
At the Lorin flrehouse the men met;
Otto and Louis Simon, who, with a
number of others, were just leaving for
home after welcoming the hew year'
with many toasts. The Simons an*d
Allseits have not been "on friendly terms
since Allseits cut. a gash in Otto Si
mon's head with a rock two years ago,
and the. result of . their meeting' was
another row. â¢"*.:"'Â¦ v?" V 1
CALLS' SIMOX SCAB.
According to the spectators it was
begun by. Allseits, who taunted the
Simons by saying: . ... Â¦ . . â¢
"You're a scab and your father hires
scabs to work for him."
Deputy Marshal Pickett heard the
clash of words and threats that fol
lowed and,- with the assistance of Dan
iel Woolley -of the fire company, sep
arated the belligerents. Pickett '- took
the Simons up Alcatraz. avenue tÂ®ward
the railroad and Woolley escorted Mar
tin and Allseits and Allseits' stepbroth
er, Henry Fatthauer, down Alcatraz
avenue toward the Allselts' home at
1634 Fulton street. ? . -j "â¢
But by the time the trio in charge
of Woolley had reached King street,
they .were accosted by the Simons, who
had. hastened toward them after prom
ising Officer Pickett to go home. Wool
ley tried to persuade them to go home,
but Lou*3 Simon brushed by him and
said: "Â¦â¢'-. . .
"I'm going to get him."
Woolley saw there was going to be
trouble, and hurried back to Alcatfaz
avenue to find Officer Pickett. Before
he had gone a block, however, he heard
shooting, five shots being flred in quick
succession. In the meantime the hosÂ»
tile-parties had begun a fist flght, in
which the Simons, it seems, were get
ting the worst of it. The fighting con
tinued until they reached a point on
Alcatraz avenue near Lorin Hall, when
Otto Simon drew his. pistol and hred. Â¦
.Allseits fell with the first shot and
lay on the sidewalk. ' The crowd Imme
diately cried, "Lynch . them," and Â¦ so
frightened the pistol wielder and his
brother that they fled to the door of
theic sister's, Mrs. Henry Young of 3250
Ellis street: â¢ Mrs. ' Young and her hus
band heard the quarreling in the street
tuxd recognized the voices of their rela
tives. Apprehending that her brothers
were in danger, Mrs. Young hurried
downstairs . to â¢ the street door. While
she' was on the- way downstairs the
shots were She opened the door,

shortly after midnight : that the â¢re
ception committee ; at the .Laun
dry Workers' Union ball at Foresters'
Hall was not duly attentive to his com
mands to be. supplied with a waltz
partner. Thereupon Joseph started
to clean out the ballroam. Expostu
lation availed, nothing. Feeney, natur
ally very muscular," was reinforced
with the effects of. numerous New
Year's potations. Irf "thp language of
the Police Court Joseph -was "fighting
'drunk." â¢
â¢ At this point Detectives George Kyte
and William B. Quigley. .intervened.
Feeney decided he wouldn't go to jail.
The plain clo'thes me"n concluded that
Joseph should taRe a. cooling off at the
City Prison. . The ; detectives, are
"huskies," but they .were both pant
ing and puffing hfter they landed Jo
\seph. When. he had sobered -some of
Feeney's friends depositod $30 for his
appearance' tb-mbr'row morninfe in "the"
Police Court to. answer to charges of
disturbing the peace and druiikenness.
Otherwise the fourth annual ball of

rus oC a" choice assortment of German^
and American songs. The "\Vatch on*
the Rhlnfe" figured strongly. ' Not less
consptcuj&us was ."My Country 'Tis of*
Thee," which was given the compliment
of being..'sung white all the. Verein
members. and their guests stood. There,
were toasts of various sorts. # Vice:
President F". Hagemann Jr.,! after the.
male chorus had plaintively and sweet
ly sung "Way' Down- on the Suwa.nee
River." offered the toast of "The Ijnit
ed States." After he had spoken he
proposed- thre'e cheers for the United
States, .which were lustily given.
The ' mixed chorus 'sang. Then the
chorus of. tire Arion Damen Verein sang
as volunteer selecti6ns a "Wiegenlied"
by Reitz'and.a "Zweigesang-" by. Gall.
The ladles einging were:
dressed in the German and American
national colors. Garlands of leaves and
flowers, lanterns and varied " adorn
ments added ' to the beauty 'of- the
scene. . V';>
Soon after 2 o'clock the male chorus
of the Verein Arion sang "Heute ist
Heut"." Then President Theo Gier gave
greeting. First, he welcomed all. He
was pleased, he said, to be the presiding
officer of .a society that socially and
musically ranked so high. The Verein
Arion led. all the German societies on
the Pacific Coast. It had proved true
to its original high aim and to the
name that it bore. He-hoped that it
w'ould continue in its work. The ladies
were potent in social and musical
events connected with the Verein. He
hoped, the guests would .feel -It of ad
vantage Jo ally themselves with the
Verein. "Mr. Gier spoke pleasantly in
German for" pome time and won the
hearty applause of : the Verein mem

NEW -YEAR'S DAY was celebrated in the usual rqanner by the residents of San Francis
co. It was the occasion for:niany pleasant social functions and informal home recep
'â¢. -. tions. Several society affairs attracted large numbers of gay merry-makers, though a
great niany people were content to spend' the day quietly at home. All places of business were
closed, and points of interest and pleasure resorts within easy access o( the city were thronged
during the afternoon by those that preferred a day in the open. The threatening aspect of- the
weather, did not interfere in the least with the pleasure seekers, large numbers of whom visited
the â¢ park and beach throughout the day. '

A kfndly attendant, found' for the

the day and night passed so pleasant

gained with their employers. to spend
an hour remained until insistent tele-
phone calls brought them back to. a
"realization of business dutyl ".
The rooms of the headquarters were
beautifully decorated with holly and
green, and many touches showed the
taste that had been expended in the
decoration*. At 4 o'clock a mandolin

Flatfootedyess may or may Â¦ not be
'increasing* among the iroderns, but it
has, at least*, brought out some Very J
interesting theories as to why it sould ,
be prevalent: 'Sa.'dow got flatfooted
"from lifting heavy r.-eights, according
to. the- opinion' of Dr. Sargent of Har
var'. Children are likely to be. af
r.icted in this # way when they wear;
spring heels, for the bones of the in- j
step, in the â¢ case of young people, de- 1
pendfor keeping their place upon ade
quate support of the heel. Fat chil
dren find themselves becoming flat
footed because of the abnormal weight
the feet have to sustain. Poor feeding
of the chifd : tends to make it flat
footed, for the bones of the foot fe
quire plentyof lime .to make them firm
and strong. Boor feeding Â¦ leads to
"rickets" as well as flatfbotedness,
though the â¢ physician .who says it does
not stop to explain rickets. .What used
to be- called rheumatism of the feet
now turns out to be flatfootednes3.
Persons who go * arefooted all the
thne are said never to get the trouble,
so we aFe led to believe tl.at if we wear
shoes at all_ we are .apt. to become as
the big policeman cr the" mythical Chi
cago girl.' If one doctor's -t"ory ;. be-,
lieved only ' old people set flatfooted
.nes3 after the bones begin t ) disinteg
rate, so to speak, and lÂ«t down the high
arch I of beauty in the instep. Asked
whether the malady was at all common
among the applicants for membership
in.the Massachusetts militia; Dr. Blood
of* Boston said : , -"Jf it exists " in' form
serious; enough to interfere with" walk
ing of course it;bars him s from enlist-'
ment." That is not surprislr._, for If
there is. one accomplishment a State's
militia ought to possess 'it is that; of
being able to walk. As for the rest of
us, we ous'ht not to care .whether we
are flatfooted or. not; for there is -less
and ;. less reason- for, our walking-any
way.âNew York Evening Post.

night.. Haugsted was superintending
the oiling of the office floor. A prepa
ration of turpentine and paraffin was
being used, and as it was not melting
fast enough he toolc the can containing
the mixture and set it on the kitchen
range. An explosion followed and, cov

into the dining-room. His wife hearing
his cries went to his assistance and tried,
to tear off his burning garments. â¢ Her
'hands and arms were badly blistered.
Guests hearing the outcry went to
Haugsted's rescue and *xtinguished the
flames. His hands, arms, head and the
upper portions of his body are badly
burnedt It is not yet known whether
he inhaled the flames. The kitchen of
the hotel caught fire, and but -for the

These are for aÂ«larga part locations

of the yellow metal: Of- late years,

."A 300-foot ledge is so ridiculous that
. only the greenest and most ignorant
â¢could- ever think of giving it a second
thought. Ths guarded statement Is
niade that 'a ledge which goes over
$3200 per ton- in places, surely .must
have some surprises.' . The company
does not claim to have this ledge or the
rich ore mentioned,' as the wording Iff
dica'tes- "The 'surprises* will come to
â¢ the dupes with' the sad realization that
they have separated themselves from
their coin. No legitimate mining com
pany- in this "county would announce
$3200 rock in : a prospectus, knowing
that; it would' immediately come, under
suspicion. While one â¢ is . occasionally
'struck wh'ich reaches: these figures, it
â¢is. not to be â¢ -supposed ' for a moment
that they. are given Wt for stcck sell
ing purposes. Sorae of 'the best mines
in the county are we" I pleased with ore
â¢milling lower than $20\by. considerable.
In fact the-gerat Empire can make a
neat profit on. less tjian $8 ore."
"The Union believes in.assisting every
worthy joining project Jn the county or
â¢ out of iff but it firmly .believe* that a
scheme, like this rs a fake, pure and
. simple/and should be exposed. Inquiry
yesterday among mining men failed to
throw any light on the Identity of the
.'Quartz Quarry Gold Mining, Company,'
which, as will be noted, is very careful
to omit â¢ the location of its bonanza,
what it is or what the company, intends
to mak,e it. â¢ â¢_â¢â¢
x "The advertisement is signed by the
'Quartz Quarry Gold Mining Company,
which gives its place of business as 1312
Market street, San Francisco. The an
nouncements concludes with 'You can
get more of this stock- after January 10
for 50 cerfts per share.' â¢
"What appears on. the face of it to be
one of the rankest swindles ever put in
print appears in the last issue of the
Mining and Engineering Review. The
advertisement is reproduced below that
"the public may judge f6r itself:
' " *\Ve expect big things from pur
mines in Nevada County. A 200-foot
ledge which goes over $3200 per ton In
gold in places. must have come sur

I . The" Cata.veras Cb.roni.ele says that a
large proposition, for the dredging of
the .vast beds of hydraulic tailings in
Chili " Gulch is. under consideration-.
Continuing the Chronicle says:
"This gulch of tailings is' be.tween
four'arM five miles long and the deposit
will range between twenty-five and 100
feet deep. All the tailings . from the
slu!ce"s of the '49 mineYs are in this
gulch. Mountains of gravel have been
washed down- . and- deposited therein.
j The mud-and-'stone chimneys which did
Â¦ service at the pioneer miner's cabin are
! out of sight beneath this- heap. Stone
I 'walls of more pretentious buildings, to
gether v.'ith orchards and vineyards,
which stood .at a good, distance from
the original gulch stream, are complete
ly hidden from view. The road, which
at different pol.nts led down- jnto the
steep ravine a # nd up on the other side
In a circuitous course to avoid the
steep grades, Is now a straight cut
'across from side to side. Millions of
cubin feet of gravel are there awaiting
modern methods to make them yield
douhle the amount they originally did
under the old. process."
â¢ The Grass Valley Union "roasts" the
Quartz Quarry Gold Mining Company,
which claims to have a mine in Nevada
County, but which the Union is unable
to find.' Some of' the statements of the
Union are as follows:
DREDGING OPERATIONS.
. The time for completing the annual
assessment ivprk on mining locations
expired at midnight on Thursday last.
There will nrobably be the usual
/'Jumping" of claims to record as soon
as the returns are all in. Many mines
Â¦will also be relocated. The performing
.of 'annual assessment wQrk, so the pa
pers published in the, mining counties
assert, is giving way to the safer plan
of patenting: when It is reasonably cer
tain that there is a mine.
mine is either bonded or negotiations
are in progress' looking; to that end."

The natives of Alaska are a fast
dwindling race. Their sun is setting.
Probably their midday sun never rose
higher than the midwinter sun. rises
in this latitude. Most of the Eskimos
in Alaska are gathered at the missions,
but the traveler will find. a few in vil
lages of two or three or half a dozen
Igloos in places convenient for fishing,
as fish is the staple diet of these peo
ple. Starvation and disease have left
but a remnant of once populous tribes.
Contact with the white race has had
a great deal to do with their deterio
ration. They like whisky, and like all
other native races are not naturally in
dustrious. Before the coming of the
white man stern necessity made them
provide for the immediate future. The
sea supplied them- with most of their
food, and there were wild berries and
various kinds of game on the land to
vary their fish diet. By instinct, in
herited from a long line of ancestors,
they are fishermen and hunters, but
by contact with the Caucasian they
are makers of curios. and traders. In
their new avocation they have become
dependent to a great extent upon the
white people. .
But the higher race is not respon
sible for. all their ills. The unsanitary
state' in which they live is not con
ducive to longevity. The impure air in
the native winter huts, the lack of-per
sonal cleanliness and much of the food
the native eats would shorten the days
of the hardest people. The Eskimo
has some qualities of character: to be
admired. He has often shared his last
bit of food with starving prospectors
or wrecked sailors. He is bright and
ingenious, simple minded as a child,
with a happy disposition that taices no
thought of the morrow. He Is bad
only when under Â¦ the influence of
liquor. "'
The Government should make some
provision for the Eskimo. He can be
made ; self-supporting, possibly a con
tributor to the' wealth of the world,
by!' placing; him in ; a 1 line of work for
'which nature has fitted him. .Provide
him; with modern appliances and
moans for fishing and whaling, and
with proper management he will be
come a -producer of wealth. â Nome

Manufacturing plants have taken a
loi.ger vacation than last year, but
many announce resumption of work on
Monday. Textile mills are confronted
with a lack of proper proportion be
tween prices of raw material and fin
ished products, and it is evident that
the cost of production, must be held
down 'in some way or other or much
machinery will become idle.
Transportation lines are well * en
gaged in handling grain, live stock,
fuel and lumber, while earnings thus
far paid for December exceed the pre
vious year an average of 5.6 per cent.
Few new contracts for iron and steel
are reported, yet the general level of
quotations is fairly maintained, and
better conditions are expected early in
1904. Soyeral special transactions are
reported in billets and wire rods at
concessions, but ttiese do not affect
list Sgures. \
Much irregularity and activity Is
reported in the markets for minor
metals, which are chiefly responsive to
speculative operations at London. De
spite a sharp break in the foreign mar
ket, tin closed the week with a net
gain and copper is also stronger, be
cause of increased interest abroad.
Previous records of footwear handling
from Boston were far eclipsed during
the past year, and there was even
more notable increase in production
elsewhere.
Only steadiness can be recorded as
to Chicago packer hides, further ad
vances being checked by the diminution
of purchases. As to the textiles, the
week has only augmented unsettled
conditions, especially as tq cotton
goods.
In the woolen division, new lines of
overcoatings continue in moderate de
mand. Firmness is still the feature, in
wool. Jobbing trade in dry goods is
seasonably quiet. Failures this week
numbered 232 in the United States,
against 298 last year, and in Canada
17, compared with eight a year ago.
BOSTON, . Jan. 1. â The Commercial
Bulletin will say to-morrow:
The wool market is steady and firm.
Business has not been active, but for
the closing days of the year sales are
quite large, the demand since Tuesday
being very good. Tight money has a
restraining influence. With any suc
cess in the opening of new heavyweight
goods and with easier money, there
should be improvement in the demand
early this year. The mills are carry
ing comparatively light stocks, much
less than at the beginnii.3 of 1903.
The news from foreign markets con
tinues bullish. There has been a fur
ther advance at Buenos Ayres on ac
tive buying. Active wools are a farth
ing higher this week in English mar
kets. Melbourne will -2 closed until
January 19, on which date the London
auction sales also open.
The shipments of wool from Boston
to date from December 31, 1902. are
236,238,050 pounds, against 283,758,867
pounds at the same date last year.
The receipts to date are 279,106,592
pounds, against 313,774,152 pounds for
the same period last year.
NEW YORK, Jan. 1.â R. G. Dun &
Co's. Weekly Review of Trade to-mor
row will say:
Violent fluctuations in cotton and
uncertainty regarding the situation In
the Far East were the only signal fac
tors 1n -the business situation during
the holiday week. Numerous expres
sions of confidence are heard regarding
the future, however, especially at the
West "and South. v
DENVER, Jan. 1.â At the police sta
tion this afternoon Fred ArnGld, IS
years of age. confessed to complicity
in the murder of Mrs. Amanda Young
blood, and the probable fatal Bhooting
of her son Robert, while attempting
to rob the little grocery store kept by
Mrs. Youngblood In Valverde, a suburb
of Denver. Arnold's confession impli
cates Newton Andrews, aged 20, and
Charles Peters, 24 years old, the for
mer of whom is said to have fired the
fatal shots. Both are under arrest.
There have been rumors of a threat*
ened lynching of the murderers, but
the police declare that they are amply
prepared to protect their prisoners. .
The young men drove to the Young
blood store and gained admission by
asking permission to use the telephone.
They tried to hold up the elder Young
blood, but, although 65 years of age,
he ' resisted until stunned by a blow
on the head from a revolver. His wife
and son, who came to his rescue, were
shot down, the former dying instantly
and the latter receiving a probably fa
tal wound in the head. He has a wife
and four children.

First Arrivals of Now Year.
The steam schooner Olympic, Captain Han
sen, was the first vessel to pass In through the
Golden Gate this year. It was a Captain Han
sen* who brought In the Point Arena; the first
vessel that entered the harbor in 1903. The
Hansens are again "it." but only by a narrow
margin. The steamer Arctic, with Captain
Nelson in command, was the laet arrival In
lfKKJ. and chasing the Olympic came the San
Pedro, with Captain Peterson on her bridge.
The descendants of Vikings had it all tholr own
way during the very tiny babyhood of l!>04,
but the Scandinavian ppell was broken when
Captain Monroe brought in the steamer Lee
lanaw and the "Captain" column of the Mer
chants' Kxchango- arrival register resumed Its
cosrrcpolltan tone.
Mariner May IÂ«ose His Eye.
Somebody struck Captain Fred Jessen. mas
ter of the scow pchooner Andrew Jackson, in
the right eye early yesterday morning, and as
a result the mariner may lose the use of the
injured optic. Who struck him, or with what.
Captain Jessen knows not. nor .where- he wus
when thÂ« collision occurred. Dr. Dig-gins, Â¦ who
treated^him' ar th'e' Harbor tloKnital,; found the
eyeba)] .punetured.. He- dressed the injury' and
Â¦Jessen .was taken to the- Marine. Hospital '

ADVA>TTAGKS OF FISHIXG
â¢ UP ORDOWX A STRKAM
Good Anglers Now Agree It f s Bost to
â¢-Â¦- Fish I'p the Pools and Down;
the Rapids.
' '"Fishinff up stream" has many ad
vocates who assert that, as trout al
trvivs lie with their heads up-current,
they are less likely to see the' fisherman
or the glint of his rod when the casts
are tnade; that the discomfort and fa
ttg-ye accompanying wading agrainst
strong rapids are amply repaid by the
iTicreased scores secured; t.hat the flies
a^ftly- ihrown a foot or two above the
hpad of a feeding trout float more life
lifcÂ« down the current than those
â¢drawn against it by the line, when
they ar*e apt to exhibit a muscular
power .which in the live insect would
be .exaggerated and unnatural.
â¢On the other hand, the ''down
jptresm" fisherman is equally assertive
as-, to the value of his method. He
'f^els the charm of gurgling waters
ar.ound-his limbs, a down current that
aidsrdlher than retards or fatigues
him.'in - each successive step of enjoy
rn^nt in his pastime; as he casts his
fifty or .more feet of line a-down the
sifnearn..he -is assured that hp is beyond
the k^en of the most keen piRhted and
xv'ary. trout'; that his artincial bugs,
under- the tension of the current seam
ing" ft -frpm right to left, reach every
r^uare Inch of the "swim," as English
rpds.ters term a likely water, :ind,
cofnfng najurallj: down stream, just
tÂ»he - <iireotioiv whence ~*a hungry
trout is a\v*iiiing.it. are much more
JikeJy to .be take-n than those thrown
sthe-cuÂ«rftiit ujth, doubtless, a
f^ot Â«ir more of the leader drooping
Â«.n<i bagging before the nose of a
tÂ£ovii with a dead bug, soaked and be
draggled, following, slowly behind. Old
anglers; whe.n fishing a rapid rtream,
â¢have {earned to adapt their methods
tq the < physical conditions of -the
water. They. have adopted both meth
ods.,' fishing up the pools and down the
rapids, thus avoiding the great fatigue
in, wading the latter and the- chance of
the trout seeing them in the more,
quiet walers of the former.â Outing.

Secretary Cortelyou of the Depart
ment of Commerce and Labor has com
pleted hi3 investigation into the ch'arges
preferred by the British Embassy
against the management of the Sail
ors' Home in this city, and has pub
lished a report covering seventy-three
pages of a Senate document of closely
printed matter.
The British Embassy "charged that
"there is strong reason for believing
that th!s institution under its present
management differs but little from a
crimping establishment, although it is
alleged that the building is the prop
erty of the United States Government
and leased at a low rent to the. home
for charitable purposes in . connection
with. the care. of seamen."
CONDUCT OF HOME.
"The . testimony shows," says Secre
tary Cortelyou, "that the Sailors* Home
at San Prancisco is, in the main, a well
conducted sailors' boarding house." The
Secretary continues:
"In 1876 marine, hospitals were main
tained by a hospital tax of 40 cents a
month upon the wages of seamen of
merchant vessels of the United States.
Whether it was the purpose of Con
gress by the act of August 11, 1876, to
provide that the Sailors' Home, for
merly a marine hospital, should be sup
p6rted by the payment of board by
the seamen inmates, or should be a
charitable institution, does not appear
clearly from the act. The committee
report on the bill (Forty-fourth Con
gress, first session. House of Represen
tatives, No. 24S) indicates that a home
for 'aged and decrepit' mariners' was
c-ne of the main objects of the gi-ft,
yet no provision for the maintenance
of the home, unless by the payment of
board, appears in the act or the report.
,"The home now appears to be con
ducted principally as a sailors' board
ing-house for the profit of the super;
intendent, with incidental philanthropy.
I have deemed it be*st to transmit the
papers directly to Congress to deter
mine whether its purpose is being ful
filled, and if not, what disposition shall
be made of the property, which is val
uable."
The testimony of Thomas Murray Jr.
is to the effect that on May S, 1903,
he shipped eleven men at the British
Consulate General's office for the Brit
ish ship Charles Cotesworth, then at
Eureka. They were to receive $25 a
month, and Murray received $5. a man
for , shipping: them, %&jjL of, these .men
did ' not^3oi'n:'becÂ«uWHfcey>were: Induced
away by" T.- B. Hawkins of; thp. Sea- 5
men's i Mutual Landlords' AssociqiioR.
of Tviixch -John -Ferem,*. superintendent
of the Sailors' Home, is a Â¦ member-
Murray and other witnesses testified
that Ferem ran a launch and employed
runners just as the rest of the board
ing-house men did, nnd that â¢ Ferem
was guilty of inducing sailors to desert
foreign vessels. '. .
Ferem admitted that he. charges ' $3.
a week at the home for aboard and
room; that he did not receive any sal
ary or other money from' the trustees,
and that he paid all the expenses of
the hc-rne out of the receipts from sail
ors and that he kept the profits. . He
denied having made sailors drunk or
having induced them to desert; He ex
riained the desertions by saying that
a sailor arriving in San Francisco 'lpon
an English, ship and receiving $12 50
a month, with poor food, and seeing a
prospect of obtaining a. position for
540 a month and good food on an Amer
ican vessel is very likely to change his
employment. .
The testimony of Thomas Chandler,
shipping master, is to the effect that
seamen's wages in Europe .' are about
515 a jnr.-rith, and in San Francisco from
$35 to SIS a month.
KARXEY TESTIFIES.
Arthur Karney, chaplain of Missions
to Seamen, testified as follows: |
"When a deeo water foreign ship
comes into port, although the men have
.signed for the round voyage back to
Europe, and this is perfectly 'well
known, the. Sailors* Home launch goes
off to such. ship and the men are in
vited to 'leave the ship and go to the
home." :
He said that he had been told by
sailors that they .had gone away to
the Sailor^* Home. In the launch, think
ing it was like the other sailors', homes
in foreign ports, and they had found
it as bad as any crimping establish
ment''here -or elsewhere^ "They, are
ashare in the home in some" cases a
fev/daysl in some instances a few hours,
and then find themselves shipped away
in another deep water ship, the wages
of the .outcomlng voyage gone , and a
month's advance of the voyage just
begun paid to the Sailors* Home super
intendent." ~; 1-", ' â¢ â¢ ;
The witness further said that Ferem
harbored deserters, knowing them to
be such," arid- that if fa sailor refused
to sign on a ship at the command of
the superintendent of the home he is
often violently turned out. â¢ >i;(;
H. TV. Hutton and A. Furuseth testi
fied thst it" would be a very serious
blow to th<i sailors of the Pacific Coast
if the management of the Sailors' Home
waÂ« changed or if the United States
Government should withdraw It for the
purposes for which it was formerly set
aside. . .

tailed oh the case and they arrested
Kelly on Kearny street yesterday
morning and locked him up in "the
tanks" at the City Prison. He will be
detained till it can be seen how many
charges ; can j be booked against him.
The police say that' he has also passed
a large number, of the bills in Sacra
mento since his release on ball by
Judge Cook.
The police were notified some days
ago that Confederate bills were again
In circulation. The proprietor of a Jap
anese store on Post- street near Grant
avenue was a victim to the- extent of
$20, Rnd a lodging-house keeper at 1
Grant avenue was victimized to the
same amount. . On Wednesday Kelly
called at the grocery of Costa Brothers,
1302 Dupont street, . and purchased
$2 50 worth of olive oil, requesting that
it be sent to his. "wife" at 722 Mont
gomery avenue. He also asked that
change for a $20 bill be sent, as his
"wife" had no lesser denomination. A
boy was sent with the oil and the
change, but on ringing the door bell
was told that no *such person lived
there. He was going away when Kelly
appeared and took the oil from him,
giving him a $20. Confederate bill and'
receiving the $17 50 change. As soon
as the boy returned to the store the
fraud was discovered and one of the
partners jumped into a baggy and
droye to the. house, but Kelly had dis
appeared, leaving the oil behind him.
Thomas Kelly, alias Frank Calla
ghan, has apparently an inexhaustible
supply of Confederate bills which he
passes on unsuspecting storekeepers.
A few weeks ago lie was arrested for
passing bills upon Â«,Tocers in the West
ern. Addition and was convicted by Po
lice Judge Conlan on three charges of
obtaining- money by false pretenses.-
He was sentenced to serve alx months
in the County Jail on each charge. He
applied for a. writ of habeas corpus be
fore Judge Cook for his release, but
it was denied on the ground that the
proper course for him to take in the
case of a misdemeanor was to appeal
against the decision of the lower court.
The judge fixed hie bail in $375 cash.
Kelly accordingly appealed and was re
leased on bail.

â¢As to the. completion of buildings, re
port is made .in the Circular as follows:
Â¦"There hiis never been a time In the
last two and a half years when so
tr.any. investors were looking in vain for
real estate investments. They want
nothing but the best; but nearly three
years', buying of the best that was of
fered has cut down 'available supplies
of investments at marketable . rates.
Even att high prices "little in the very
best' .business sections is offered. A
higher interest rate of money has had
a . .good effect on the tone of the real es
tate- marjeet. "because it has made buy
ers more cautious, ?.nd though it has
reduced -the number of buyers some
vrhat.. enough laFge purchases are re
corded to keep up the monthly totals to'

The sales in 1903" led those of 1902 by
5300,000 in round figures. Continuing
the Circular, pays:
' :*"The" falling off In one section in
â¢which .the' domand had decreased by
reason of a raise in prices or a lack of
siipply has been about equaled by the
increase, in other sections. When it is
rprhenibpred that the r.ales for the year
ilÂ«52 exceeded those of any 1 previous year
in our _ history i>y : nearly $11,000,000, it
will, then be sren .that the activity of
the rcaj estate market, has been well
sustained and. its healthy tone main
tained. This has. Bit continued in- spite
nf.Eii kdvarw of interest during the
last half of tli" year, and of a condition
nf thÂ«Â« la-bor -and material market which
has actually prevented the erection of

<>f such, other real. estate* the purchase

. The realty record of San Francisco
for; the .rear 190S has been made up.
The sales numbered 6356 and the value
represented was 547.710,157. These state
ments aro *nade by the Itcal Estate Cir-

prosperous yeans in the history of San
Francisco's rcalfy market.
in the Circular the following para
praph is printed .lhat illustrates the
ppnfral drift of tiff business:
Illuminated bell-buoys have^been" in
use for many years at Honolulu. The
channel through the reef entering the
harbor at Honolulu is well defined by
illuminated buoys set at short intervals.
Colonel Hanbury of the Lighthouse
Board does not. favor the proposition of
marking the course of the ferry-boats
with illuminated bell-buoys.
He is of the opinion' that the bell
buoys would Increase the danger of col
lision on the bay, owing to congested
navigation, and that the buoys would
be in the track of passing vessels.
Colonel Hanbury also says that it
would not .be possible to .conflrte the
ferry-boats to a definite course/, owing
to the changes "of the v . tides. -'. Â¦
\A suggestion has been made to the
United States Department of Com
merce by a- resident of Oakland to have
the course of the ferry-boats between
San Francisco and Oakland marked out
by a chain of illuminated bell-buoys;
The commuter in his c6nimunicatioh
to the lighthouse officials of the De
partment of Commerce pointed out the
danger of bay navigation to ferry
boats.
His idea ia tha't 'a series of small
illuminated bell-buoys would lessen the
danger of collision and enable the ferry
boats to travel in foggy weather with
safety.
