Not Informed
of Peace. .
GODZYADANI. Manchuria, Sept. 10.â
At 1 o"clock yesterday afternoon a Japan
ese commissioner, bearing a white flag
&nd escorted by fifty soldiers, arrived at
a post near the railway and handed to
the Russian officers who went to meet
him a letter from Field Marshal Oyama
lo General Llnevitch, congratulating him
on the conclusion of peace and begging
him to appoint Russian plenipotentiaries
lo arrange for ah armistice. Field Mar
shal Oyama had appointed General Fuku
ehima es plenipotentiary for his side, the
letter announced, and he suggested Chak
hedza as the meeting place.
When news was received that the peace
negotiations at Porstm'outh were, ap
proachlrjr a conclusion the correspondent ,
cf ihe Associated Press made a survey of
all the Russian positions from Mongolia
to headquarters, the object in part being
to ascertain the manner in which the ef
forts making for peace were .viewed by
the army. The negotiations received no
official recognition In the field prior, to
their successful conclusion, the army
keeping in a state of preparedness for a
battle until the receipt by General Line
vitch of a telegram from Emperor Nicho
las, declaring that the treaty had been
signed and that his Majesty accepted the
conditions. This telegram was officially
published in the army newspaper on Sep
tember â¬ and the outlines of the peace
conditions were printed in the same pub- i
lication yesterday. ' V. .
TROOPS FEAST AXD CELEBRATE.
The officers thereafter observed mili
tary decorum in the strictest sense, but
the soldiers, with the consent of the offi
cers, engaged in feasting and other forms
of celebration. It will be a week more
before the entire army is .fully informed
of the conclusion of peace, but the news
was discounted long ago by the prevailing
conviction that, since the appointment of
the plenipotentiaries, peace was a fore
gone conclusion. It may be said that, to
the great majority of the ofilcers and men
so far informed, the news that the war is
at an end Is ooct welcome.
Thousands are daily drinking to the
health of President Roosevelt. The cor
respondent, who is the only remaining
foreign newspaper man with the Russian
army, was everywhere asked by the men
if he was an American, and on being an
swered in the affirmative they captured
him and tossed him many times in the
air, after the manner of the Cossacks,
\u25a0while their ofilcers gently protested
against the seemingly Questionable form
of their admiration.
Everywhere along the railway where
newspapers could be obtained the' sol
diers eagerly scanned the news and then
expressed their joy by singing, which
they continued late into the night, at In
tervals cheering for President Roosevelt.
.\O XEEDLESS SACRIFICES.
With the exception of the loss of a cap
tain and two orderlies on the f;ast front
within the past two weeks and of nine
men in the center a week ago. there have
been no casualties. The cessation of hos
tilities was preceded only ,by unim
portant reconnaissances involving small
parties of scouts. Care has been taken to
prevent further loss of life.
Owing to the enormous tract of coun
try east of Hailungcheng and between the
Russian lines along the Vladivostok rail
road and the Japanese position in the
'ChangpaiEhan Range, it will require some
time to reach all the elements operating
In the Interests of both armies and in re
storing the regions occupied by both
flanks to order.
The officers are holding races at Toer
shu and at other places.
' The Fourth Siberian Army Corps, which
played a conspicuous part throughout the
war, was reviewed on September 5 by its
commander. General Zaroubaieffi \u25a0\u25a0 who
has won high fame throughout the army
because of his prominence in the battles
of Tatchekiao and* Liaoyang, in the pro
tection of Mukden and in the retreat
from that place. The general is men
tioned as among the first who will return
home.
The disability of General Zeppitzky has
steadily . Increased and he will be com
pelled to return to Europe. This officer
was noted for his singular bravery
throughout the war. He was wounded at
Mukden, when he lost three-fourths of his
Tenth Army Corps.
It is reported that General Llnevitch
will leave soon. The general staff is en
gaged in plans for charging the com
manders throughout the army prepara
tory to evacuation;
FEAR THE SITUATION AT HOME.
Among the soldiers generally there Is a
feeling of apprehension regarding the in
. ternal affairs of Russia and many of them
have express ed "â¢ ; a â¢ desire to remain in
Manchuria" indefinitely.

OYSTER BAY. â¢ S*pt. â¢ 10.â President
Roosevelt to-day made puolic the report
of 'the Keep Commission on its recent in
vestigation of affairs In the Government
Printing Office at Washington. The in
quiry was. made by special direction of
the President on account or a protest
which he had received from officials of
the Mergenthaler Typesetting Machine
Company against the award of a contract
by Public Printer Frank W. Palmer to
the Lanston Monotype Company for
eeventy-two machines of its make.
By order of the President, the contract
with the Lanston Company was held up
until an investigation could be made with
the view of ascertaining whether the
charges of favoritism and corruption In
the letting of the contract were subse
quently founded, as heretofore chronicled
in these dispatches. The President de
cided, after an examination of the Keep
report, that the contract for the Lanston
machines should stand. The Keep Com
mission, reported that If the contract
cculd be set aside "such a course would
be desirable, although the commission
states expressly that no corruption, pay
ment or promise passed from the Lanston
Monotype Company to the public printer
or to any person in the Government ser
vice."
It developed by the Investigation, how
ever, that yvo important assistants of the
public printer were indirectly Interested
in the Lanston Company, "their wives be
ing stockholders therein." The com
mission shows that a fair and impartial
test of the Lanston and Mergenthaler ma
chines was not made, and reports that
the purchase of so large a number of
L&nston machines was "Improvident"
and indicated "great partiality and bias
en the part of the public printer." The
commission . regards the purchase as
"maladminiBtration." " v \u25a0-\u25a0â¢
The report of the commission Is volumi
nous, containing, about 16,000 words. Ac
companying It. is a memorandum by
President Roosevelt in which he approves
the report except as to the disposition of
the contract for the Lanston machines,
which he has directed shall stand. The
text of "the President's memorandum fol
lows:
â¢OYSTER BAY. Sept. 9. 1905..
"The conclusions of the commission
are hereby approved, save the latter
part of conclusion 1. It does not ap
pear that there is any question as to
the validity of the contract in question.
If it had not been for the conduct of
the Mergenthaler Company in prefer
ring tHe charge discussed by conclusion
2. that of corruption, I should . Agree
with the commission that it would be
desirable to set aside the contract, If
such a course were legal. But second
only to corruption in a public office, in
point of iniquity comes making a base
less charre of corruption, and this is
what the commission finds the Mergen
thaler Company has done in this case.
Its comments being in part:
COKHLPI'IOX SOT PROVED.
"'ln the light of the failure of the
company to produce evidence of such
corruption. It must be held that the
charge was made recklessly, and the
Mergenthaler Company should, be
severely condemned for including such
a charge in a formal communication to
the President of the United States,
made as a basis for official action on
hi* part- It is fair also to the Lanston
Monotype Company to say that no evi
dence was presented by the Mergen
thaler Company, nor was any obtained
by the committee in the course of its
hearing, tending to chow any promise,
payment or consideration of any kind
whatsoever made by the Lanston Com
pany, or. any of its officers or agents,
to any person in the Government ser
vice.*
"Had thiÃ charge of corruption been
made, I should have entirely agreed
with the conclusion of the commission
that if it were possible (which it is
not). It would be desirable to cancel
the contract in question.
"Public Printer. Palmer has been re
moved from Qfflce. The cases of the
subordinates alluded to In the report
roust be taken up In connection with
the discipline and reorganization of
the bureau when Mr. Palmer's succes
eor assumes office.

\u25a0they may be examined by the public at

making a minute personal; Investigation
of the extent of the disaster, visiting even
the smallest hamlets In the, stricken
provinces and carrying funds and ma
terial for the immediate relief of the
starving and ill-clad people. Everywhere
he is met by crowds who appeal to him
for aid. Despite the efforts, of . the au
thorities many persons nave- not yet been
reached, owing to the difficulty of bring
ing sufficient supplies. The relief trains,
which are carrying food, clothing and
medical supplies, are compelled to : pro
ceed slowly, .owing to the fact- that great
fissures have been caused at many places
along railroad tracks by, the -shocks.
Everywhere . in . the disturbed area the
people are sleeping 1 in the open air, even
id places where the .houses are safe. The
population appears to have been stupe
fied by the catastrophe.' The . greatest
caution is necessary in .the search for the
victims, as the walls are continually, fall
ing. Soldiers, citizens and doctors are
working' heroically, but they, have to be
frequently relieved because of the hervou3
breakdown resulting from the horrible
rights encountered by them.
Along the Gulf of Saint Eufamia, facing
tha Island of Stromboll. all .the pictur
esque villages are totally \ ruined, and
many of them may not.be rebuilt, because
the surviving Inhabitants have resolved
to emigrate to the United States. Most
of the deaths accurred among women and
children, the men escaping, as they were
at work In the fields when the . principal
shock took place.
King Victor Emmanuel and the DukÂ» of
Aosta will arrK'e at Monteleone to-mor

Ferraris.
The Pope has been deeply affected by
the disaster and has instructed the bish
ops and other churchmen to afford every
possible aid. . .
Funds are coming in rapidly . from all
sources, both public, and private. The
Ministerial Council ha 3 voted. $50.000 : for
the relief of the sufferers, and Premier

E. C HU6BES. PIUNTM,; -CUBA DOES
NOT FAVOR
THE TREATY
Commercial and Economic
Associations of Havana Are
Against Ratification 'of
Agreement With England
WOULD BE IXDHCAL
TO UNITED STATES
Expression of Opinion Is
Given in Kesponse to Re
quest of Foreign Relations
Committee of the Senate
HAVANA. Sept. 10.â Two of the prin
cipal commercial and economic associa
tions, responding to a confidential re
quest made by the Foreign Relations
Committee of the Senate for advice as
to whether the pending treaty between
Cuba and Great Britain ought to be
ratified, declared emphatically against
ratification. The principal reason given
is that Cuba's commercial interests are
too inevitably bound to her great cus
tomer, the United States, to permit o*
granting for ten years such privileges
to British ships and citizens as those
named In the treaty. Another reason
given is that the adoption of the treaty
would allow privileges to British war
ships &s well as merchantmen not war
ranted by the relations between Cuba
and Great Britain, and not permissible
in vie.w of the relations between Cuba
and the United States.
The latter reason Is considered the
most potent one on account of the sus
picion that the treaty, while ostensibly
one of commerce, navigaton and amity,
would In reality give to British war
ships greater privileges in Cuban ports
than those given the United States by
tlie cession of two naval stations.
TREAT Y SIGNED LAST MAY.
â¢ The treaty was signed In May last
.after the favored nation clause had
! een eliminated in consequence of rep
resentations made by Mr. Squiers, the
American Minister. The United States
Government, on receipt of a report re
garding the alleged objectionable fea
tures, made a peremptory representa
tion against the treaty. A copy of the
treaty was then sent to Washington,
eince which time, according: to a state
ment made to the Associated Press by
Secretary of State O'Farrill, the United
States ciovernment has ceased its rep
resentations regarding it. It is known,
however, that in Washington the treaty
is regarded as inimical to the inter
ests of the United States, not perhaps
in a commercial sense, because it docs
not contain any tariff concessions, but
in the broadÂ«?r political significance of
allowing British warships equal rights
in Cuban ports with those of Cuban war
ships, under plea of stress of weather
or accident, thus giving to Great Brit
ain privileges greater than those
granted to the United States.
The Senate committee to which the
treaty was referred confided it first to
the Havana Chamber of Commerce and
afterward to the Central Economic As
sociation.
NO REAL BENEFIT TO CUBA.
The former reported to the effect that
\rhi!e the privileges and immunities
granted appeared to be mutual,
they did not confer any real
benefits on Cuba, which had few
mercantile ships and on war
ships. -A-hile the extension of her ship
ping: might be hampered by granting
equal privileges to . British ships.
The chamber emphatically advised that
Cuba do not concede that in cases of
stress of weather or of accident both
British merchant and British war ships
shall have the right of "abastercerse
and pertrecharse."* Spanish words- sig
nifying ret-pectlvely to supply with pro
visions and with war supplies and am
munition. The chamber considers this
to be Inimical to Cuban interests, es
pecially as no reservation was made re
specting the laws of international neu
trality. The chamber also considered
that it was unwise to conclude a treaty
with an oversea power while no such
treaty existed with the United States,
especially when changes in the reci
procity â¢ treaty are advocated, which
may include provisions for special re
ciprocal t.-vriff privileges regarding
goods carried on American and Cuban
ships.
The other association has not yet
submitted Its formal report, but it
strongly holds that the treaty is inim
ical to the interests of. Cuba and the
United States.
Secretary of State* O'Farrill. on the
contrary, declares to the Associated
Press that the treaty contains nothing
inimical to the interests of the United
Stares under any circumstances, and
some other persons who are close to
the Government assert that suspicion
regarding the treaty is unwarranted.

SCIENCE PROGRESSES
IN FIGHTING DISEASE
Dr. Gallwey Makes Interesting
Observations While Abroad.
. Dr. John Gallwey. the eminent surgeon
and physician, and Mrs. Gallwey, who
have been abroad for the past six months,
returned to San Francisco Saturday even
ing and have taken apartments at St.
Dunstan's.
Their foreign journey included stops at
all the important cities of Germany,
France and ..Italy, where the doctor de
voted considerable time to inspecting the
leading hospitals and discussing with dis
tinguished members of his profession va
rious matters pertaining to medicine and
surgery.
One of the doctor's purposes of absent
ing himself from this city was to indulge
In surgical experience in some of the
leading hospitals of the East, where he
did considerable work prior to crossing
the Atlantic on' a tour that has not only
been instructive, but restful to him after
many years of close attention to his pro
fessional duties in this city. Throughout
the entire portion of the Eastern conti
nent visited by him. Dr. Gallwey found
the medical . profession closely studying
means for combatting the- spread of in
fectious diseases, and with a success that
bodes much good for the future welfare
of the world. Of his observations in this
direction while abroad he said last even
ing:
- "The advance in medical science, espe
cially in the direction of increased knowl
edge of various methods of the transmis
sion of diseases, has been exceedingly
great. The resulting benefits to mankind
need no demonstration beyond the man
ner In wh^ch organized medical authori
ties have grappled with outbreaks of bu
bonic plague, and Asiatic cholera abroad
and yellow fever in New Orleans, and 1 the
success following the measures put in force
to prevent the spread of and to stamp
out conditions which four years ago
would have been followed by widespread
epidemic and great loss of life.. Improved
sanitation in communities is always at
tended by a lessened number of cases of
acute infectious diseases, and consequent
ly a lower death rate. Prevention of dis
ease is the gospel now being j preached,
and In this direction the medical profes
sion has accomplished j much. With the
active and intelligent co-operation of the
laity it will accomplish more in the near
future."
Continuing, Dr. Gallwey said that clean
liness and sanitation are the greatest ne
cessities in meeting emergencies. such as
have been encountered in fighting the
spread of disease in the South. He cited
the fact that A threatened bubonic plague
in Glasgow . recently was promptly
checked and overcome by prompt resort
to medical science, and he also called at
tention to the fact that in New Orleans
yellow fever has made little if any pro
gress in the cleanlier sections of the city,
while in the localities where humanity
is huddled together under poor sanitary,
conditions the disease proved a hard one
to fight. . -

CAPTURED AT CONCORD
Constable Identifies Little
Fellows by "Means of Pic
tures Printed in The Call
BERKELEY. Sept.^, 10.â The fond
dream of a tour round the world on
the princely sum of J5l, indulged in
by Master Eddie Johnson and Master
Freddie Gordon. 11-year-old lads of
Berkeley, was rudely dispelled this
morning: wii*n a vigilant deputy con
stable of Concord, Contra Costa
County, discovered toe youngsters an 4
promptly took them into custody.
Edaie Johnson and .Freddie Gordon
6tole $51 belonging to Jlrs. Jennie
Sand, an aunt ot toe Johnson boy. and
lift their homes in' South Berkeley last
Thursday nigni. They purposed going
East, but bad vague ideas or the cose
of tne trip. Kes^rCing joi as a sum
ample for the purchase of railroad
tickets and a lot of otuer things, they
did not hesitate to dip into tne treas
ury and buy tne things tnat the heart
of a boy usually craves.
Each lad purchased a new - Bult. a
new hat. pearl-handled penknives,
quantities ot candy and. chewing gum
galore. Their railroad tickets- to Chi
cago, they said, were to be bougnt
later â all out of the $51.
The Concord constable spoiled all of
this prospect. He Identified the two
lads through the pictures of them
printed in The Call and the description
given by Marshal Vollmer of Berke
ley. A teVrgram to Vollmer lnformins
him of their capture In concord was
received at the Marshal's ofSce: this
morning and Vollmer went after the
lads late this afternoon, meeting them
at Valiejo Junction. The boys are so
small that it was deemed impracticable
to put them in jail and they were re
turned to their parents at 1600 Falr
vleiv avenue. Their cases will be given
attention by the probate officer of the
county at once.
The Johnson youth, very small for
his age and of a. cherubic cast of coun
tenance, has a record of offenses that
includes burglaries of stores and steal
ing of wheels and griding: camp imple
ments, lie is regarded as incorrigible,
though of unusual intelligence-. Fred
die Gordon, his companion, is 'a few
months older, but is also undersized,
so that the pair make about the tiniest
brace of juveniles the police have yet
had to deal with, s'.v't*? .
Mrs. Johnson, mother of. Eddie, vis

BOY AND CHURCH
PASTOR'S THEME
Responsibility of Parents
for Behavior of Their
Sons Discussed in' Sermon
SUGGESTS NEW METHODS
Rev. Robert Whitaker Says
. That Services Should Be
Made More Attractive
. OAKLAND. Sept. 10.â In the last of a
series of sermons on boy life the Rev.
Robert Whltaker, pastor of the Twenty
third-a venue Baptist Church, to-night
dlscuEsed "The" Boy's Church." outlining
the methods which must 'be pursued to
interest the boys jir.d bring them to the
houses of worship as earnest workers, In
stead of interested listeners to some
times, unwelcome sermons. This series of
sermons by Mr. Whitaker was occasioned
by the murder of Thbmas W. Cook, which
was .committed by three boys whose
parer.tx are' residents of the East Oakland
community, and was given in the Â»hope of
bringing parents of other boys to realize
that they will be held responsible for the
actions of, their offspring if the latter
turn into paths of vice and crime. '
After a brief recapitulation of the other
addresses of the geries Mr: ""Whitak'er said
to-night:
The boy !s the frrat problem of tht pr^sfnt
day, and the â¢ sooner that parents realize this>
the sooner will the State and natjen be able
to solve the problem. Yhe boy is the problem
of the hcra<-,.as Tfgard? his environment and
education, snd he is the. problem of the State
as regards affording him Â« fair chance for
proper employment.-- By far theigreatest prob
lem by which the State is confronted, hew
ever, is thÂ« elimination of i the boy criminal,
euch criminaJÃ as those Â«no committed the
brutal crime which shocked and horrlned our
community but little more than a month ago.
I be-lieve that * long step toward the solution
cf the problem has been taken by the State in
the establishment of the Juvenile Court, but
this is not all that is bvceMarj-; ' and it .-c
matns for the church ana the parents of ihe
boy to complst- the work thus begun.
Tr.e problem of the church fs to Interest the
boy and bring him to lead a Christian life," and
to accomplish this four things are necessary.
FirÂ«t, we must go after tne boy and bring Him
Into the church, and then we must thow
enough intereft la , him to keep him. - Second,
the church mwt adapt its methods to thÂ« needs
of the boy for something to 'lnterest him. "and
this can be done. I believe, by vitalizing the
morning servlees of the church and instilling
seme life into thÂ« Sunday-school. . Third, we
must recognize the varieties of boy' experience,
and. last of all, and- by far the most important,
the church must seek and oecure the co-opera-*
tioa of the parents of the- boy. As in all forme
of education, th* religious education of the boy
must begin at bjome.. and through the indiffer
ence of the church this is too often neglected.
And in closing I would say that we must de
velep boys that- they may â¢ bring their com
panions . into the church. No \u25a0 nation can be
Â«vanseliied. except by native evangelists, "and
just co it takes . boys , to evangelize : boys.'* '

STEAMER KVICHAK ARRIVES
Reports Drowning
of Well-Known
Boatman.
Ted Peters Loses
Life in Northern
The steamer Koichak arrived in port
yesterday, SS 1 ,* days from Karluk. She
brings 14.999 cases of salmon to the Alas
ka Packers" Association. Captain Nelson
reports the news of the death of Ted
Peters, the well-known water front boat
man of this city, who was drowned about
three weeks ago in the Kvichak River. At
the time of his death Peters was running
a small launch in connection with one of
the George F. Hallcr canneries at that
place. He was towing a small boat be
hind the launch, when the line connecting
the two parted and the boat, began to
drift away. Peters, who was an expert
ewimmer. rolled off his clothes, jumped
overboard and swam toward the drifting
\u25a0 boat. He had only taken a few strokes
\u25a0 when he suddenly sank Into tfco rusmn;
stream. The launch at once put at^jt
and those on board waited for him to
come to the surface. He never appeared.
Archie Spades, who v.-as a friend of Peters
â¢and who was on the launch at the time
of the drowning, spent five days In drag
ging the river for the body, but without
success.
Ted Peters <whose name was Edwin Pe
ters) was perhaps as well known as any
boatman on the water front, where he
had worked for the last fourteen years.
For years he had â¢ been one of the en
gineers for Henry Peterson. He ran the
Peterson launches Amy and Sybil when
the.y were first built. Two years ago he
went north as engineer on the gasoline
-whaling vessel Monterey. In April of this
year he went north again on -the, gasoline
schooner Expansion, which is In the
ealmon trade. He was a native of Eng
land and about SS years of age. He leaves
a mother residing in the United Kingdom.
Menagerie on Doric.
The forward 'tween decks of the steamship
Doric look like a juvenile Barnum & Bailey
circus. The place Is filled with cages of ani
mals and birds of many kinds and descrip
tions. Chief among these Is a bisr lion cage
c-ontaininK a magnificent spotted leopard. It
is a splendid sample of the animal kingdom.
In another oare is an immense ape. Then
there are other cages containing hundr?ds of
shattering monkeyn. both bis and small, while
hanglne from the beams above, are dozens of
cages filled with sweet singing birds.

COMPOSES MASS

WOBK OF HIGH MERIT
Adds Much to the Standing
of San Francisco in tiie
. World of Art Production
San Francisco is fast becoming a
center of art productionâ its painters,
Its writers and its' music-makers find
ing apt " expression for .that*, .which
sways their souls. It is in;the 'atmos
phere, a part of the air, : and the sea
and the sky.; It is, in short, new Italy.
â¢-.-Yesterday ..; added .; another :"\u25a0 artistic
achievement to San Franclsco-^-the pro
duction, of a beautiful new : mass
(Messa Brevis) : composed by; Richard
A. Lucchesi,Â«a musician of . high repute
both here and in Italy, whence he came
some fifteen years. ago. ,
Musiclans.like painters, vary widely
as to the worth of a composition, oft
times moved to decisions from personal
rather than artistic/, motives, albeit
unconsciously./ /, â¢ : . ; : /
But the judgment rendered
day at the initial production was sin
gularly, at one, the/comments' of the
music folk "in the choirlof t ; showing
full 'appreciation .of . the work of the
local composer and; most of/ them had
the courage to say; soâ no easy, thing
when .the work is a home product. S
Not, perhaps, that ; the . mass is
throughout a masterpiece, but it shows
careful/compliance with the rules . of
classicism; it- is -melodic '.-.", throughout
and carries with it the deep devotlon
allsm that characterizes the ritual of
the Roman/church.; â¢, ./. ,
Particularly was the "Credo" dis
cussed by the musiciansâ that most dif
ficult part of the mass to be set to.
music, and. by. connoisseurs It was pro
nounced masterful. T But'it was the
"Sanctus," constructed upon a bold
theme and 1 reaching an: imposing .cli
max, that was styled the best" number.
The "Aye Maria," witha violin obll
gato, was, J however, the most fetching
number of the composition" to the 'lay
ear. The appeal to the Holy Mother
was tender, pleading and full of beauty
and as pure as dew In the morning. '"\u25a0
j The mats is notable In that there are
no unnecessary repetitions of the" Latin
text. "\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0â¢\u25a0"\u25a0 \u25a0â¢\u25a0 \u25a0
R. Harrison, the organist, performed
his part with enthusiasm, as did Miss
V. G. Hickey. Miss T. Sullivan. David
Manlloyd,/ William Sandy, who i com
prised the principal quartet. These
were reinforced by a large contingent
of clever amateurs. .'The "Aye Msria r>
was sung In charming fashion by Miss
Vlbiana G. Hickey, the soprano;- the
violin obiigato being rendered by Miss
V.Johnson. â¢ ; " . -
A number of society and professional
folk filled: the church, many occupying
the loft as guests of the gifted com
poser. At the close of the mass Mr.
LucchesJ held. an Impromptu reception
in the vestibule, -where he was shower
ed with congratulationsâ and' this from
musicians who possess discernment.

SMELTER PEOPLE TO
SOON SELECT A SITE
San Brim o Point Favored
/ for Trusts New
â J. itllLl. .
W: The return to this city of E. B. Braden,
local â¢ representative . of j the . smelter trust,
has'been followed by a report,;emanatlng
from'a reliable source, that the Guggen
heims. have;, practically "selected a site for
their I proposed \ big smelter. . and refinery
on San Bruno Point ; which ; lies south of
Hunters Point on the' bay shore.
It ia '' said that the point ' meets nearly
every: requirement of the trust, especially
in the, fact that the locality is so remote
from the city and its | populated suburbs
that- all objections against smoke and
fumes will, be overcome.
.The site Is said to include a sufflcient
acreage I for, all Uhc needs , : of a. smelter
plant. ., Railroad ;is the only
matte r that is worrying the \ trust people,
who : are anxious to \u25a0 make their plant ac
cessible to the* Santa Fe line as. well as
toUhat of the Southern Pacific. . The lat
ter: can: easily ' extend Its, rails from' its
yards south of -j this clty'to" San : Bruno
Point. In the ; cass of : the | Santa Fe, how
ever, 1 it will probably be necessary- for
it .to reach the property by way of the
water, arid in view of this possibility, the
smelter people are inow flguring'on exten
sive plans for dredging the ". water front
portion of the 'point and constructing 3000
feet "of I. trestle out^ into .the. bay. When
seen at the St v Francis Hotelilast evening
Braden; said regarding.*the selection of
San Bruno Point;' - t ' â¢ ..'\u25a0
. : ; ."\Ve have made no. purchase, but it^ ls very
probable \that" It will be chosen as the Â«lte for.
the new smelter plant. ;' It is' a , favorable lo
cation and In more than one way excels a num
ber of sites on, the" east sidÂ« of San Francisco
Bay that we have had under consideration. '^. We 1
are not trying to : conceal \u25a0â¢ our plans any more
than â¢ possible. - nor are jwe '\u25a0 buying ground
around' the- San h Bruno property -for- any. spec
ulative purposes. \' A definite 'decision as to the
purchase of the point will be arrived at very

The parents of William Hammond/a
boy,; residing* at Fifteenth, and- Noe
streets, are /worrying over- his < absence
from home "since ' last | Saturday fore
noon.' when -he V left to- "engage In his
vocation of "selling. ;ipapers " \on ; the
.streets. The father called atrthe dif
ferent:: police' stations 'and; emergency
hospitals yesterday to: learn: lf, any ac

MONEY AND MERCHANDISE.
LAST week was better: than Its predecessor. There was more
vigor in general trade and the bank clearings switched around
again and showed a gain of 32.6 per cent over the same week
last year, with Baltimore the only large city showing a loss of any
volume, and the great majority of the most important cities ami
towns exhibiting large gains. San Francisco made a fine^ exhibit in
this direction, the clearings being $6,583,000 larger than during the
corresponding week in 1904. . Â»
General trade, however, is comparatively featureless. The com
mercial reports from the different sections cf the country all specify
the same expanded business, the same excellent distribution of mer
chandise, easy collections, abundance of funds and fine crop prospects.
These bright reports from all over the country have really become
monotonous. There is. however, one significant feature which is
worthy of note,. and that is a small but perceptible advance in the.
average price of commodities. Dun's index number advancing from"
$99,846 on August 1 to $100,308 September 1, against $79,842 Sep
tember 1, 1904. This increase is ascribed to the .increased consump
tion of general merchandise throughout the country, and as such
is a highly gratifying indication of the continued prosperity".
The condition of the great staples remains practically un
changed. Crops are being harvested under favorable conditions,
and, barring the ever-attending menace of.Jrost, the corn and cot
ton crops are practically out of danger, though the latter crop will
be considerably below that of last year; Hides and leather con :
tinue firm and active all over the world, with a brisk demand due
to heavy consumption. The markets for cotton and woolen goods
ere still up to high planes of activity, with the mills fully employed
as a rule. Provisions are moving off well at .the Western packing
centers, but the market 'is without excitement. The wholesale
grocers all over the country report business excellent. The iron and
steel trades continue to show a steady expansion, but copper has
lately declined somewhat.
The money market has lately shown the irregularity usual at
this time of the year, when the crops are being moved, but there has
been no pronounced advance in rates. Any rise in interest seems
to draw forth an immediate supply of cash, whereupon the rate at
once falls back again. It appears now that large blocks of money
had accumulated in New York and other financial centers, both do
mestic and foreign, in anticipation of a demand -from Russia to
liquidate the anticipated indemnity to Japan ; but the waiving of
the indemnity by the latter power has disarranged all plans in this
direction and released these hoarded funds upon the open market,
which has the effect of keeping it well supplied with available cash.
It is worthy of remark in this connection, however, that the rate of
discount of the Bank of England was raised last week from 2*/ 2 per
cent, where it had stood since March 19, to 3 per cent, showing a
harder money market hi London. This rise is attributed to large
demands by Paris upon London for gold, and liberal engagements
for shipment to South America.
Several j-ears ago there was a good deal of talk about large
quantities of "undigested securities" in "the. American stock marker.
In due course of time these securities became absorbed. or, in other
words, digested, and the expression was no longer heard. But
lately there has been some recrudescence in this direction, and the
statement is now made that the large stock: market interests are
carrying a mass of securities which they are anxious to distribute to
the public as soon as sufficient purchasing power is available. That
some of these securities have recently been thrown upon the New
York stock market is indicated by quite a pronounced decline in the
whole list of stocks during the past week. The times are propitious
for more or less selling in this direction, but it appears that the se
curities were ladled out rather too freely, hence the. decline.
The local situation shows no new features of great importance.
The crops are on the same basis as previously noted, hardly any of
them being over the average, and a number falling below it, though
the high prices ruling for most products fully offset the deficiency
in the yields. Local bond brokers report that the supply of money"
in the interior banks has become so liberal that the banks have sent
a good deal of it here for investment in good bonds. T*he city banks
have been doing the same, which accounts tp some/extent for the ac
tivity in the bond market during the past several weeks. It is not
at all a bad sign when money becomes so plentiful that the. large in
terests handling it are obliged, to pry about in various direction^ for
channels in which to profitably invest it. Not Jn;modern times has
there been such a' plethora of actual money, in the world as there
has been for the past several years.. In other words, the World is
flush. " â¢/^'* ; ' ;: 'v^f
BISHOP POTTER'S TAVERN.
44 IMPLY the problem of the recreation :6t the poor" is the term
by which the promoters of the famous Subway Tavern name
the effort of Bishop Potter,* which faitcd, when the tavern
failedÂ«on the last day of last month. \The promoters pocket a gain
of experience in saloon business and record; a. 'loss on -their books of
$16,000 without one murmur of blame against; the Bishop. In" the
formal statement which explains the change of the intended ideal
poor man's club into a plain, profitable gin-shop it is said:. "The
promoters must express their gratitude. to Bishop; Potter, who brave!
a flood of publicity by giving his sanction to the enterprise and who
suffered a flood of most intemperate abuse 'from- those who were ig
norant of conditions in New York Cityâ conditions which still im
peratively demand a better regulation of the liquor traffic." ;
It is to be hoped that 'this absurd mistake of mixing ''rum and
true religion will not paralyze f urther "efforts. to solve the problem
of the recreation of the poor. The hope y for -this! intended temper
ance tavern when Bishop Potter tried to hallow it by singing /'Old
Hundred" at its opening was to give the I poor, man a. sort of; ideal
substitute for the rich man's club. The initial one. was to be an
* ensample of the worth of the, idea,, and so be the beginning of a
chain of temperance taverns which would extend through the city
and in a large measure rescue men from the grosser evils , of dram-,
drinking. They were to be self-sustaining and pay 5 per cent:
Some half-dozen or more hopeful men put up $10,000 to try out. the
experiment of bettering what could-nbfbe abolished^ .The sum sunk.
Then Joe Johnson secured $6000 ' "moreâto conquer by the perse
verance plan. That also was submerged in the subway saloon. Theii
the promoters decided that perseverance had ceased to be a virtue:
Skidmore, the man who is to take" charge of the tavern and trans
form it into a regular barroom unhallowed by hymn-singing, gives
the reason for the alteration this way: "You can't follow "the Lord
a.nd chase the devil at the same time." Johnson, president of the
promoters, says : "Skid is a wonder at running a business, but If ear
he has not the high ideal." .Many.-. causes are given i ; and guessed^ at
for the failure, but the one reckoned the most potent^ is thus graph:-;
cally expressed : "The disinclination of the < plain man "dallying
with a jnug of ale to being rubbered at by. delegations of" the
W. C. T.U." y _

Tuesday was California Club day. If
there's busier lot of women here
abouts than these householders I
haven't scon them. Every day for two
months delegations of members have
been making pilgrimages to the new
clubhouse at 1720 Clay street, near Van
Ness avenue, and on the club's open
ing day had many notes to compare
and a lot of thing's to talk about.
Tl-.^-re was the club house almost ready
to so intoâ all but the finishing. And
. Architect Knowles, who has been such a
"War." ha 3 promised that the premises
shall be turned over to the furnishing
committee this week.
If it hadn't been for the obstreperous
nvss of the Beard of Public Works, which
succeeded in making Itself persona non
grata with many of the women, the build
ing would have been ready for occupany.
But the women realize that the board
must 00 something to earn Its salary, so
have forgiven the little setbacks.
The club has decided to open the club
house with a big receptionâ an evening
affair, that our men friends may see
what women can do when they concen
trate their efforts. When the affair will
take place is not now definitely known,
but it will presumably be during the first
week in October.

for Places i at .Columbia

Picture of a Cliicago AMieat
Panic Arouses Ambitions
to Agaiii "Bull" or "Bear"
The tragedies, of the fates were never
more clearly, shewn "on \u25a0 life's panorama
than they were at the stage entrance at
the Columbia Theater yesterday, after
noon. The occasion was the i hiring of
Si)o supers for the thri.'.ln's "pit scene" for
the coming production of "The Pit". by
Wilton Lackaye. ~ 7 > : .
Men of every, class and description were
thert;. Every one was seeking a job and
many had a tals of former fortune to tell.
Two hundred there were in all; although
half as many more will be taken 'on. be
fore the opening, night.
Of this motley crowd of applicants the
broken-down "brokers ; Were .very- numer
ous.j^Men were theie who had taken. part
in real panics caused by a rapid fall or
rise in wheat panics, btinging: ruin to
thousands. : Within- tue. hearts of these
warriors there was a fierce. feeling of bat
tle, the longing to be once more into the
f ray ; to bo back where they were ' mas
ters of the situation; to live once more in
the whirl and intensity of five hundred
frantic brokers. To them th.s chancewas
a stimulant of the most powerful kind,
and for no reason \uould they allow them
selves to be rejected. It was not .. the
money they were ' afterâ the jjj pay is 50
cents for each performance, and the most
of them were earning more than -that
through their daily stipendâ they wanted
to be once more in that ' enchanted ring
called "the pit," where. In their excited
brains, they could imagine that they were
jostling and trading with the most pow
erful buhs and bears of the age.
Little matter to them was the fact that
the scene was not realâ the money, is
stage bills, the buying cards' are perfectly
blank,, and although one broker, may ex
citedly tear his hair, and cry that he is
ruined he really is not. To-morrow he
will be back to work in his humble posi
tion again, .and to-morrow night he will
be repeating the same words..;
"I am a bum now." frankly said one
applicant for a position yesterday after
noon, "but it was, not; long ago that I was
not. I saw ' that scene when . Leiter came
into the pit and madly offered to buy. I
saw his friends urging him to leave, and
I read the agony on his face when j he
realized 1 that all was lost, that no human
agency could stop -that heart-breaking
decline in the price of wheat. "I was a
tra'df.r for myself then- and I hitched my
star to Letter. When the end came I was
penniless, and since then I have been try
ing to get together enough money to get
back. This chance was one whose tempt
ing power forced me ;to come. 1 can live
over the old days again. "\u25a0-\u25a0
Others repeated similar stories. They
were true, too,. for Stage Manager How
ard Boulden cross-questioned each appli
cant. "It i 3 so in every great olty," he
said, "although I have noticed it more in
San Francisco. Hundreds of :men who
were once watching .the tickers, and who
have made and lost- fortunes come to get
i.ntn this scene." '*'\u25a0 . '; ; "S
The famous "pit" .scene will show 300
brokers madly, buying, and selling wheat.
It is a pleasure of the hour of the great
break- in Chicago. _

AIIE OF GREAT SIZE

Two sun spots are now exciting consid
erable Interest among the Harvard as
tronomers on account of their size. They
are close together, somewhat above the
center and on the right side. They are
estimated to be 100,000 miles in diameter
twelve times as big as the earth. When
they first appeared on Friday they were
not easily visible, but now they can be
plainly seen through smoked glass, or
even with the naked eye when the sun is
low. Whether the hot weather Is cau3ed
or affected by them is not known.
Each spot- consists of an umbra, or
dark spot, surrounded by an outer fringe
of lighter penumbra. The shape of the
whole is Irregularly oval. These spots
are supposed to collections of condensed
gas containing solid matter, but scien
tists' are < not agreed, and : some astrono
mers think that the tspots a'rp depressions
in the surface of the sun. The spots on
the sun at present are among the largest
which have appeared in recent years, al
though they cannot compare with tho?c
which appeared in IS22.â Chicago -Inter

GAXS CHALLENGES NELSOV.
Daltlmore Man Says Brltt AVas Beaten
Because He Waded In.
BALTIMORE, Sept. 10.â Joe Gans. the
lightweight champion, and his manager,
Al Herford, declared to-day that the re
sult of the Kelson-Britt battle was not
what they had expected. Gans said that
had Brltt followed his usual clever style
he would have won.
"Britt Is not a rugged fighter," said the
champion, "and he was never known to
score a knockout. I believe It would have
been impossible for him to have knocked
out Nelson, but I believe he could have
gone the limit and he would have won
the decision on points. Nelson could never
have beaten Britt had not the latter
fought him at his own game.
"Kelson at the start probably made Brltt
angry by punching him, on the nose or on
some other irritating place, and the Call
fornian must have lost his temper. He
waded Into the Chicago lad, to the lat
ter's liking. Nelson took advantage of
this and kept forcing matters with him.
Nelson scored on a clean and decisive
knockout, I'll admit, but he could never
have done so had Britt kept his senses
and stood him off. It would have been a
good bet that Brltt would, have worried
Nelson so had he resorted to his hit-and
get-away tactics that Nelson would have
gone down on a chance blow from Brltf.
" "Now that Nelson has defeated Britt 1
would like to have a chance with the
victor. Nelson can claim the lightweight
championship title all he pleases, but he
will have to beat me to make sure he
holds it. .1 won the title squarely from
Frank Erne in May, 1901, at Fort Erie,
Canada, and I have never been defeated.
I believe I am Nelson's master. . When
Sullivan fought Jimmy Brltt on the coast
a few months ago I tried to get on a
match with Nelson, but the latter would
not talk business with my manager. ' I
will fight Nelson under any conditions he
wants, but he will have to square with
me In the selection of a referee."
Manager Al Herford. speaking for Gans,
said he would bet $5000 to $4000 that Gans
can beat the Dane.

EXPORTS AND IMPORTS .
: OP THE* CITY OP BOSTON
Former No Larger but Latter ShoTr
Substantial : Increase.
It Is impossible as yet to arrive at any
Idea* of the effect which the recent ruling
of the Interstate .' Commerce Commission
has had on the; export- trade of the vari
ous Atlantic ports which were involved in
the freight differential controversy, owing
to,the unavailability at this early date. of
the statistics on which to base a Judg
ment., Whether Boston has been gaining
or losing, relatively, is a matter, of vital
concern ; to the commercial Interests of
this locality, says the Boston Commercial
Bulletin, .but until- more is known about
the. matter ; we shall have to'bo contented
wih'the significance of the figures relat
ing" to the foreign commerce of Boston
alono- - . ' " \u25a0' ' . . â¢
rFcr the. fiscal year, ended June 30, 1905,
it : appears that Boston's . foreign com
merce underwent a "substantial Increase,
although it was entirely confined to Im
ports. For the flrs.t time in our history
theso reached the $100,000,000 mark,' a gain
of almost â¢ $20,000,000 over the imports for
the , preceding, year. As . we have inti
mated, however, our exports were slight
ly smaller than a year.agoâ about $2,000,
000 lessâ notwithstanding -that for; the
same period ; the country's - total exports
attained record-breaking ,' proporions. .
So far as the showing of imports Is con
cerned, our. commercial Interests have lit
tle ; cause f or^complaint, but .with the gft
ures for exports there is much to be dis
satisfied. In order to find a year which
witnessed a- smaller, volume of exports
from Boston we ' must go back to 1905,
when : they stood at $55,505,000. If we go
back still further, we ';, find that in 1802
Boston's : exports amounted' to . <87,175,000,
or practically the same as for \u25a0 the last
nscal | year. ;\u25a0 In , other Swords, after.vthe
lapse of thirteen \u25a0 year3 l Ãoston's exports
are found to be in precisely " the same po
sition" as they ? were at the beginning^ of
that period.â New York Commercial. / :

HONORS WHICH COME WITH SUCCESS
IN RING ARE BORNE BECOMINGLY
Dane Promises Jimmy Gardner a Match, v but the Latter
Must Agree to Reach the Lightweight Limit;
JIMMY BRITT HAS NO INTENTION OF RETIRING
Ba.ttltttir Kelson and Jimmy Britt were
about town yesterday and both bore the
mark* sustained In their combat at Colma
on Saturday. Nelson's right eye does not
open as .It should normally, while his
left ear is considerably swollen. Ills left
hand is his most serious Injury. This
is badly bruised and it is believed one of ;
ths bones is injured. It has apparently
been driven back out of place.
Nelson gives Britt all the credit for a
knockdown in the third round of Satur
day's fight. "It was a good blow," he
said, "and took me by surprise. I went
down hard because I was a little off my
balance, but it did not hurt much. It was
a good crack.' though."
Father Nelson was robbed of his wal
i.et as he was returning home from the
Battle of the Sons." Battling had cau
tioned the old man about pickpockets
and the fond parent had care
rully placed his spare change in
a great wallet. . When he arrived at the
trainings quarters both wallet and
money were gone. Bat laughed at him
xor a long time. "I gruess you weren't
meant for the city, dad." he eaid.
.. We will buy lots in Hegewisch." said
the old man, who eeems barely able to
realize the extent of his eon's fortune.
Before we could get land only by the
f^W I*?*''l^1 *?*'' 1^? 1 now w Â« w Â»l *>uy it by
the block. Won't there be a hot time
in that little town," he added.
BKITT TO HAVE E^TUHX MATCH.
Battling says that he will give Britt

PERATE STRUGGLE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY IN THE PRIZE RING.

another chance. "We will take any of
them on now," he said. "When .we do
take on Britt," said NXjlan. "we will in
sist on a good sized side bet, and there
â¢will be no running- away from it,
either."
Nelson is .commencing early to reap
the rewards of his victory. He was
sought after by theatrical people yes
terday and will make his appearance at
the California Theater to-nig-ht in con
junction with the musical comedy, "The
Wise Guy.*' He will box three rounds
wrth Bob Lundie The Engagement will
continue for fifteen weeks if Kelson so
desire* and he will appear as far East
aa Chicago.- He will not agree to go
farther East with the company as he
believes he can make more money if he
goes into New York under his own
management. .
Nelson said yesterday that he had
promised Jimmy Gardner a match if
the. latter will agree to fight at IS3
pounds. He refuses â¢an engagement
with Joe Gans, the lightweight cham
pion, claiming he was not treated fair
ly by the - latter's manager â¢ when he
fought Sullivan In Baltimore some
months since. , There are so many en
gagements in sight that it is not likely
Nelson will be seen in the ring for six
months.
Jimmy Britt had lost his dapper air
yesterday. He declared he had no in
dention of retiring from the ring. "One
defeat does not necessarily mean the
retirement of a fighter," he ' said.
'\u25a0Gans, Young Corbett, ' Nelson, Jim
Corbett and others all -met reverses
in their time and were afterward suc
cessful in the ring. I will not bother
Nfclson adout a return \u25a0 match Â« now.". It
is only Just to let him reap 'the re
ward* of his victory.' Wherl the prop
er time arrives I. hope to getia^returh
match with him and hhe .catn t sit: down
and write his own articles, of agree
ment. The receipts of; the fight were
a disappointment to us all., We'^be
lieve Nolan with his foolish "actions
regarding the. referee knocked at least
$20,000 out of the receipts."
THE CALIFORXIAVS ERROR.
There was some discrepancy as" to the
receipts of the fight in the figures given
out, but the $45,2U mentioned in The Call
were correct ' Willie Britt. in explaining
away his brother's' defeat, said Jimmy
was tired of hearing' the cry.
"Run, Jimmy, run!" and . decided to get
in and slug with Nelson at the latter's
own game.' _He took ' a lot â¢of blows he
might have' easily*, stopped. The manag
ing brother said. that defeat would never
injurethe fighting Britt, but that victory,
might have a~ tendency to do so, as a suc
cessful fighter 'ls â¢always the object of
much . flattery, and entertainments
BriU was given La . warm ' reception .at
. the Orpheum. last night. 7. .:..;*, \u25a0'\u25a0..\u25a0 ;./
A prominent physician. of this city.. who
was at ' the . ringside I and who does ;riot
care. to have his name mentioned because
of his friendship tor the Britts. gave some '
scientific reasons '. yesterday, for the defeat'
"of Jimmy Britt. - ._
"Britt overtaxed hi6 . heart."' the doctor
Â«s!d, "and' he succumbed; The blows de
livered by, Nelson in the eighteenth round
were noffcny harder than Jimmy, had re-^
celved in previous rounds." and" he, would
NELSON IS A MODEST VICTOR
have assimilated them had his lungs not
become congested and his. heart not
lagged In its action.
FIGHTERS ARE OVERTRAINED.
"I noticed in many of the rounds that
Britt's neck presented a. purple ihue and
that 'Spider' Kelley,' his second, was kept
busy rubbing the rainbows out of his
back. The bluish appearance in Britt's
back could only have been caused by, the
failure of his heart to beat normally.
Britt made, two mistakes in training
first, he overtaxed himself, and, secondly,
he took too many dips in the surf. . . ? \u25a0;
"These things have a \u25a0; bad effect on the
heart and actually, weaken â¢ that
ant function of the body. Had Britt
trained in the mountains and come to
Colma the day~of the;battle, he; would
have been in. better shape. The' low at
mospheric pressure at , the beach" and
working as he did in a close gymnasium,
crowded with people, did him no good. In
the fifteenth round. I" discerned the same
bluish appearance in Nelson's back, but
he recuperated quickly and in .the next
round the .tinge was gone. . -
"Had Britt \u25a0 been given about ; a one
twentieth, grain of strychnine/ he .would
have been materially aided. ',"'.- This \u25a0 would
have strengthened his j heart action.' . He
might have used oxygen" as did Jim Cor
bett when he . fought./ Jeffries, -but \u25a0:. he
would have to become^accustomed'to it in;
training. In my obinion BrlttV over
trained and this lost .himV-the battle!
Again, he should have; fought 'Nelson
scientifically and not slugged." -. \u25a0
' There is some humor \ attached ] to . the
excellent moving pictures ; secured of -the
fight. In, looking over a r proof yester
day Willie Britt saw a numberj of 'people
whom he thought were the friends of his
brother. lie saw . a., smile, oh:;their?fea
tures and as ; the picture \ showed j Jimmy,
Britt had Just. been knocked "out he' feels
they will have a hard * time i explaining
their attitude. Some of .the /spectators
helped themselves 5 to light refreshments
during, the progress 'of, the; fight; and- in
some way obtained an . impression? that
the : photographic : films ' were '- not'ibelng

his trainer, , says ; Sysonby; is 'â¢ the j greatest

says'. Sysonby - was \u25a0; not* the equal' of ) Eth-"

f air to- judge Sysonby's endurancelby, his:
Saturday's race in the Annual Cham-,

not; at This best. .Whether.^ the
poor showing, he made ",was v due to ; an in-;

As usual after a. big tournament, thers
was little life yesterday at thÂ» tennis
courts.' Most of the cracks who per
formed at San Rafael last week took a
well-earned, rest. At the California Club
courts a few of. the players w.ho did not
figure in the tournament engaged in somo
lively practice matches.
The best" match \u25a0or the day was a sin
gles between Frank Mitchell and .Grant
Smith. The . latter has heen out of thÂ©
game for i. some time.' but played well
enough to divide thÂ© honors with his op
ponent.. Mitchell won the first and third
sets, while Smith tools the second and
fourth. . Smith volleyed and served as well
as .ever, * but V otherwise was somewhat
rusty. 'Mitchell played a good backcourt
game, but was rather weak at the- net.
Th 6 score was 6-2, 3-8, 7-5.- 3-6. ,
-Herbert and Melville Long played threa
fast sets. The younger Long was in ex
cellent form and . disposed of Herbert
rather easily. ,ThÂ© score was 6-3, 5-7. 6-3.
Dr. Lovegrove and Charles Kuehn k two
of the best men in the third class, met.
and the former won two sets out of three.
The score was 6-1, 6-7, 6-3.
George' Cutter and H. A. BiddlÂ© -won
two matches. ln doubles. ' . /

noise. Joseph's cries for help made the
other members of the family hurry ;to
the room occupied by him and Robert

saw that the folding bed had closed up.
The bed was pulled back and Joseph
was taken out. He had escaped with
out any serious injury. Robert was un

FIGURE ON EXTENSIONS
Los Angeles ' Street Eailway
Magnate Anxious to In
vade Central California
Despite the frequent ' assertions * that
have been made that E. H. Harriman
and H. E. Huntington are parties j to an
agreement wherein . Huntington, is -pre
vented ! from invading with his electric
lines the territory claimed by Harriman
north of Tehachapi, it has been learned
from a reliable source that the Los An
geles street railway magnate is how, pre
paring to come north.
A deal is being quietly effected between
President Gardiner of the Monterey
County Gas and Power Company and
Howard E. Huntington, son of the mil-
lionalre,. for the purchase of the electric
railway : between Monterey and Pacific
Grove,, owned by the Gardiner, syndicate.
In fact it is reported . that the . deal '\u25a0 for
the possession of the seven miles of road
will .be .completed by, the Helimans of
this city, acting for the Huntingtons, in
a few days. ' .-.?" !;- '-'\u25a0\u25a0 . . '.''"Â»
.- Under the -terms of the deal It is said
that the .Gardiner people will also turn
over to the purchaser of their road the
rights of way obtained some weeks ago
for an electric '"road from Monterey to
Santa Cruz, by way of Salinas and'Hol
lister,. which, when built, 'will form an
extension : to the road between Monterey
and Pacific Grove. â¢ It is common gossip
that the Huntingtons and . the owners of
the proposed electric, line between -this
city and Santa Cruz, known as the Ocean
Shore road,, have an" understanding
whereby their interests Will" be harmon
ized so as to insure a through electric
service . from this I city . to, .Monterey and
Pacific Grove. It is this prospective com
bine that is said to have been worrying
the Southern Pacific officials and hastened
their efforts to block the plans for the
Ocean' Shore road, which threatens to
seriously affect the coast- business of the
steam lines, especially in the way of pas r
senger traffic. President Gardiner^ of the
Monterey Gas and Power Company has
been, in San Francisco -for several â¢ days
in conection with the pending deal for' his
