CANNON FIRED AT THE CZAR
Charge of grape goes crashing into imperial chapel where the entire Romanoff
family, surrounded by a brilliant assemblage ot courtiers and foreign diplomats,
is participating in the solemn ceremony of the blessing of the waters of the Neva.

Several Wounded.
ACCIDENT OR PLOT?
Big Gun Firing Salute Speeds
Forth a Deadly Missile.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 20, 4:10 a. m.âln spite of the official state
ment that the cannon shot yesterday, which might easily have destroyed
the whole of the Romanoff family, was the result of carelessness In leaving
a shotted cartridge in the breech of the gun after target practice, the mys
terious case is still under the combined investigation of the military and
the police, and the public seems as little inclined as the authorities to ac
cept the published version. The officers and men of the battery have not
been arrested, but are confined to barracks and by the military regulation*
are so closely under restraint that it is Impossible for the culprit or cul
prits to escape until the responsibility is determined. It cannot be said
definitely whether the affair was an accident or the result of design. The
general belief that a widespread plot did not exist, but evidences of de
sign are so apparent that the statement attributing the presence of a
loaded shell to previous target practice evoked smiles in many quarters.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 17.âThe |
ceremony of the blessing of the waters |
this year was accompanied by an event j
â¢more mysterious, unprecedented and i
extraordinary than any afforded by the !
annals of Russian history. For a Rus-
Si an sovereign to fall by the hands of j
an assassin is no new thing in Russian ,
records, but tha\ the Emperor should
narrowly escape death by a shot from i
his own artillery while he was engaged
:in a solemn religious rite, surrounded j
by. priests of his church, is so difficult â 
to realize as to be almost incredible.
Yet this is what occurred to-day and j
x-bc Ttwssratf public Is left wondering
and mystified.
By the merest chance the imperial
family escaped unharmed, but public
opinion is stunned might have
been the tragic results of the affair.
The festival of the Epiphany, the
blessing of the waters, had just con
cluded at 1 o'clock this afternoon when
.simultaneously with the salute fired
from the Sts. Peter and Paul fortress a
rain of grape shot crashed upon the lit
tle chapel built over the frozen Neva
in front of the Winter Palace, where
Emperor Nicholas and every member
ef the Romanoff family were partici
pating in the service. Some of the mis-
Eiles went high, entering windows of
the splendid row of salons along the ,
water front, from which the Empress,
the ladies of the court and the members
of the diplomatic corps, including Em
. bassador McCormick, Secretary Eddy
and Second Secretary Bliss and all the
high dignitaries of the state, army and
navy, were witnessing the glittering
6pectacle below.
CZAR'S NARROW ESCAPE.
The Emperor had a miraculous es
cape. Some of the bullets actually
struck the little open chapel in which
he was standing, cut the staff of one of
the standards and fairly riddled the
basement windows of the palace, killing
a policeman outright and wounding an
officer and three marines.
The shot was fired from a gun on the
Bourse battery. Had the gun been
. aimed a little lower the charge of
grape might have destroyed the whole
Romanoff dynasty.
â¢ One of the bullets which entered the
Nicholas Hall, where the diplomats
were gathered, struck down a golden
plate from the wall.
The first impression of those who
.heard the crash in the little chapel was
' that it was due to falling crystals from
the glass chandeliers and caused by
concussion from the booming of the
guns. When the truth was realized the
windows were hastily vacated and the
greatest excitement prevailed within
the palace.
Lieutenant General Fullon, Chief of
Police of St. Petersburg, himself picked
up a missile in the white salon. It was
the size of a bird's egg.
In the meantime, there was no evi
dence outside of what had occurred.
The crowds of people who formed black
lines along the quays, the palace
bridge, the steps of the Bourse and
every other point of vantage in the
whke arctic landscape did not betray
â¢the slightest excitement. Neither did
the imperial party In the chapel below.
Although the actual ceremony was end
ed, the Emperor remained and accom
panied the metropolitan and clergy as |
they circled the pavilion around the
"chapel to bless the gorgeous standards
â¢of the famous Guards regiments as
sembled there. Then the procession
moved back to the palace and the orig
inal programme was carried out.
The Emperor displayed splendid
nerve. He did not show a trace of ex
citement. He received the diplomats in
his usual cordial, gentle manner, re
viewed the Guards regiments on the
. square behind the palace and subse
quently had luncheon served in the
state dining-room.
OFFICIAL VERSION OF AFFAIR.
It was stated in official circles to
night that the grape was fired from one
of the guns of the Seventeenth Battery
of the First Horse Artillery of the
Guard, the most aristocratic corp* in
the Russian army. It was asserted that
at gun practice on Tuesday a loaded

shell was inadvertently left in the gun.
The official account of to-day's affair is
as follows:
"During the ceremony of the blessing
of the waters of the Neva to-day in the
presence of the Emperor, as the usual
salute was being fired, an accident oc
curred. A charge of grape instead of
a saluting charge was fired from a gun
belonging to one of the batteries sta
tioned near the Bourse. Some bullets
struck the facade of the winter palace,
or the quay gardens, breaking four
windows. A policeman belonging to
the Bt. Petersburg force was wounded.
According to the information to hand
at present, no other accident occurred. '
Inquiry continues."
Whatever may be the solution of to- j
day's affair, it is a strange ftct that
the shot came from the Bourse Es
planade, where was stationed the First
Horse Artillery of the Guard, the pre
mier artillery organization of the em
pire and one of the most noted regi
ments in the whole Russian service.
The roster of this organization of
aristocratic traditions has included
grand dukes, princes and some of the
most illustrious names in Russia.
Lieutenant General Grippenburg was ;
formerly an officer of the regiment and
Grand Duke Serglus Mlchaelovitch, the
chief artillery inspector of the Russian
army, whose duty it is .to conduct the
investigation, was himself formerly
colonel of the regiment
THEORY OF MILITARY MEN.
Military experts say indications point
to a charge consisting of grape having
been inserted surreptitiously in a salut
ing cartridge. If this was the case, prob
ably only one man was Involved. Cer
tainly if there was an extensive, deep
laid plot, or if an officer was involved.
It was badly executed. It was pointed
out that it Is hardly probable that an
expert artilleryman should have pre
pared a weak, scattering charge which
could hardly carry across the Neva. At
the same time an Indication of design
is the fact that the gun was aimed
directly at the imperial pavilion. Had
the gun contained a service charge or
a regular shell the pavilion must in
fallibly have been destroyed. It is
clear, however, that the saluting was
done most recklessly, as the flashes of
the blank shots from Sts. Peter and
Paul fortress showed that the guns
were directed straight at the Winter
Palace.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.âSecretary
Hay's note to the powers, calling upon
them for explicit statements of their
attitudes toward China's integrity and
the preservation of the open door, has
"smoked out" all of Europe and pre
vented the carrying out of a conspiracy
' for the disintegration of the Chinese
Empire. The fact that Great Britain,
j Germany and Italy had responded most
i favorably to Hay's Inquiry and pledged
! themselves anew to the principles laid
, down by Hay in his first note last
> February quickly brought the other
powers into line. France and all of the
other nations to which the inquiry was
sent replied to-day. giving new and.
HAY FOILS
CONSPIRACY
OF NATIONS
even more binding promises of their
purpose to prevent a spread of the war,
to protect China from further encroach
ments and to maintain the open door.
With these assurances Hay considers
the case complete. Within the last few
days he has discovered more of the de
tails of the plot which he suspected
when he sent out his hurried inquiry.
He has satisfied himself that, in send
ing out the note charging China with
violations of neutrality. Russia was
beginning to work out a conspiracy, to
which France, at least, was a party.
SCHEME OF THE POWERS.
It was planned that, when the powers
met to consider the terms of "peace,
France (and perhaps other nations)
would insist that Russia be given Man
churia if she won and Mongolia if she
were defeated. Then, to "maintain the
balance of power," France was to move
the border of Indo-China far north
ward, and, to keep peace in the family
of nations, England and Germany were
to extend the limits of their "spheres of
influence" in the Yangtse Valley and
on the Shantung Peninsula The other
powers were to be given smaller slices
until there would have been nothing
left of China but her history. Unless
the reinforced pledges that have been
given to Hay be broken, the scheme
cannot be carried out.
The plan is believed to have been al
ready abandoned, for Russia has given
up the Idea of an invasion of China
This information was conveyed to Hay
to-day by Count Cassini, the Russian
Embassador, when he handed to Hay
Russia's answer to the American reply
to Russian charges that China had vio
lated neutrality.
RUSSIA'S REPLY TO HAY.
The Russian reply was confined to a
reiteration of the charges against
China, but contained no hint of the ac
tion which was threatened In the first
note. This was done, Hay believes,
pimply to keep the record clear from
the Russian point of view.
Count Cassini expressed regret that
Hay had believed the statements of
China and Japan rather than those of
Russia. He said that the United States
was the only power which had replied
to the Russian note. It was inferred
from this that the European nations
were waiting to see what Hay's course
would be.

STRONGEST OF ALL LOBBIES
ARRAYED AGAINST PRESIDENT
TWO WOMEN
TESTIFY FOR
REED SMOOT
Fair Gentiles Aid
the Mormon
Senator.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.âTwo prom
inent gentile women of Utah, one a
member of the Legislature that elected
Reed Smoot a Senator, were witnesses
to-day in the Smoot Inquiry before the
Senate Committee on Privileges and
Elections. Both gave Senator Smoot
an excellent reputation and testified
that they would not vote for a polyg
amist.
Mrs. Mary G. Coulton of Ogden, the
wife of a physician, testified in regard
to political affairs. She was a member
of the Legislature that elected Smoot
She said she went unpledged, but was
glad to abide by the result of her
party's caucus. Before voting for
Smoot, she said, she ascertained that
he was not a polygamist. Speaking of
the Mormons in political affairs, she
said they "sized up" very well with the
gentiles. Polygamous relations were
never flaunted by the Mormons, said
Mrs. Coulton, and the young Mormons
particularly were opposed to the con
tinuation of polygamous relations. As
a member of the Legislature, she said,
she was asked by as many gentiles as
Mormons to vote for Smoot.
On cross-examination Chairman Bur
rows asked if it would have made any
difference in her vote for Senator if she
had known that a majority of Smoot'a
fellow apostles were polygamists. She
replied that possibly she might have
voted for Smoot because many gen
tiles welcomed the opportunity of
showing that their antagonism was not
direq>ed against the church, but mere
ly against the principle of the church
known as polygamy.
Mrs. W. H. Jones of Salt Lake City,
who said she went to Utah at 16 years
of age as a bride and who has been
prominently connected with the Liberal
and Republican parties in Utah, testi
fied that neither she nor Senator Bmoot
had Joined the Silver Republican party
and said that both of them had "too
much sense."
On cross-examination the witness
said she did not believe a polygamist
could be elected to office by either gen
tiles or Mormons.
"How about Mr. Roberts?" asked
Chairman Burrows.
"That was so long ago I do not know.
I was not working for Mr. Roberts and
I am glad you did not permit him to

Mike Donovan Tells
of Bouts With
Executive.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.â"Mike" Dono
van, dean of boxers, has Just returned
from Washington, where he boxed with
the President for an hour every after
noon for four days. It was the first of a
series of bouts which are to continue
next week and the week following.
Donovan talked of his experience re
luctantly.
"It was the first time I had boxed
with Mr. Roosevelt since he was Gov*
ernor," he said to-night. "If anybody
tells you he's an easy mark, don't be
lieve it. He knows how to use his
head, too. I never saw a man pick up
faster than he In these four days.
" 'Don't mind hitting me,' he said
right at the start, T want you to hit
me as often as you can, and don't mind
how hard, either.' We started off in
good fashion, and every time we hit
each other he laughed good naturedly.
It was not any tapping, I tell you. They
were good hard blows, the sort that you
wouldn't run into knowingly. We had
seven-ounce gloves. The President took
his part of it always with a laugh.
"I never saw a pleasanter man, or
one who gets more enjoyment out of
the thing. He had as much fun as a
boy, and he laughed and joked all the
time. He's a fighter, and knows how
to give and jtake blows. He doesn't try
to knock a man out, but he does like to
know he has hit him. He kept me
busy, and I was not running Into any
of his blows, either. Don't get the idea
that I was there to teach him, not by
any means. He is a veteran boxer and
can hold his own with the best of them
in the clubs. I know few men who box
regularly in athletic clubs who can
worst him.
"I have arranged to go down several
more times to box with him and to give
lessons to Theodore Jr."

New York Women
Take Kindly to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.âThe idea of
having visiting cards for dogs has late
ly come Into considerable vogue In New
York. Many fashionable young women
who are possessors of dogs have not
only furnished their pets with a full
wardrobe down to handkerchiefs worn
in the tiny pocket of a blanket which
is made to resemble a miniature box
overcoat as nearly as possible, but are
insisting that the social side of "Dog
dom" should be looked after. The cards
generally are much smaller than a
man's visltng card and it is the cus
tom to bestow the family name on the
canine.
The latter* cards are not generally
understood to be intended for the
young lady on whom its mistress Is
calling, but for the dog or dogs of the
family. The fad is imported and comes
originally from London.

â¢ isiation pauses for a time in the House,
where the way has been made clear for
the bill. Colonel Hepburn, chairman of
the Interstate Commerce Commission,
announced to-day that his measure was
not ready and would not be introduced
before Saturday. The real reason that
it is not satisfactory to the administra
tion is that it does not go far enough to
correct what the President believes to
be the real evils of the situation.
Among other things, it is said, the
phraseology Is altogether too ambigu
ous.
Meantime, the railroads are gaining
ground and time. Their representa
tives âand many of them important
menâare at work both in Senate and
House. In fact, they'are overrunning
| the Capitol. At no time in recent
j years has railroad influence in Wash
ington been so strong in numbers and
importance. At no time has it been so
conspicuous or so open in Its fight. It
is new the President and the House on
one side and the railroads and the Sen

and will be waged for a year or more.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Jan. 19.âCamllle Flam- I
marlon is now engaged on four differ- i
# ent books, each one of which is keeping j
him so busy that he hesitated to say |
which he will bring out first. Having
just finished a work on "The Caprices
of Lightning," and having brought out
â¢ only a few months before that a book
on the elements of astronomy, Flam
marlon is now collecting data for two
entirely new volumes, and recasting
two others. For the general public, the
most interesting of the new volumes
Avill be that on "The Unknown," fol
lowing up the treatise published three
years ago in which Flammarion es
sayed to establish as a scientific fact
that there are such things as appari
tions and premonitory dreams, but in
which he hesitated to enter into theory,
not considering that he had in hand
sufficient material to demonstrate more
than what he considered the simple
truth. Flammarion has been at work
ever since gathering new evidence, re
ceiving daily scores of letters from all
parts of the world, and in his second
volume he will approach the discussion
of the general laws which may govern
psychological phenomena upon earth.
Flammarion's other new work, in
tended only for astronomers, will be
another volume on the planet Mars.
His first volume is the only complete
work ever published on this, the most
interesting of all the planets, and the
second volume, continuing these stud
ies, will give the results of the observa
tions which he has been making year
by year at his private observatory at
Juvisy, near Paris. One of the curious
phenomena which he has witnessed
and of which he will speak is the ap
â  pearance of snow on the Martian poles
in the late spring.
When not occupied with these two
important works, Flammarion busies
himself with revising "The Plurality of
Inhabited Worlds," the book published
when he was barely over twenty and
which established his fame, and his
"Popular Astronomy." Both these '
books have remained classics and, re
markable to say, not a word contained
in them has been disproved by the dis
coveries of recent years. Nevertheless,
there is much which has come to light
since their publication, and Fiam
marion is bringing them thoroughly
up-to-date. The "Popular Astronomy"
is about completed, and the new cdi- ;
tion is expected to appear shortly.
"THE DICTIONARY."
It is over a year since "Katherine
Frensham" made its appearance and
during nearly all that time Beatrice
Harraden has been working on a play
âher firstâwhich is quaintly named
"The Dictionary." It was finished
about three months ago, when its au
thoress decided to take a leaf out of
Justin Huntly McCarthy's book and
make a novel of it as well. Accordingly I
Bhe set to work and hopes now to have
the romance ready for publication in
the spring. The play will be seen
later.
It will be rather interesting to com
pare a new novel which Frank Frank
fort Moore is now writing with one
produced last year at home by Miss
Hallie Erminie Rives. For, like "The
Castaway," Moore's forthcoming ro
mance has Lord Byron for its chief
character. It will be called "Love

expects to be putting the finishing
touches to it at the end of another

cerpts from the great works of the past
being ingeniously quoted to bear on
current events. For instance, apropos
of its recent criticisms of the Drury
Lane pantomime the newspaper quotes
the lines of Juvenal ending "his child's
unsullied purity demands the deepest
reverence at a parent's hands," and
some rather telling lines from Church
chill'B "Rosciad," while the fall of Port
Arthur brings appropriate selections
from "Samson Agonistes" and Caesar's
"Civil War."
Andrew Lang, who was at some
pains a while ago to explain why he
did not like George Ade, is now at
eiual pains to explain why he does not
like dogs. In an iconoclastic essay,
which he contributes to the Christmas
number of the Illustrated Kennel
News, the co-author of "The World's
Desires" denies the dog practically
every virtue with which man's friend
is ordinari'.'' credited. Jle says: "There
is not of the sevfh deadly sins of
which the dog iB not habitually guilty,
and I am unaware of a single redeem
ing feature In his repulsive character."
Lang denies that the dog is brave.
He denies that the dog is faithful, de
claring that the fidelity is really all
on the side of the man, and Lang says:
"It needs a great deal of fidelity in
man to cling as he does to the dog,
licking, as it were, the paw'(the mud
dy paw) which tramples him."
Lang adds that the dog is vain. "The
self-consciousness and vanity of dogs,"
he says, "might disgust even a minor
poet. I have known a collieâcertain
ly a very handsome collieâto pass his
days in contemplating his own image
in the glass. I know a dog dandy
which actually makes eyes, being con
scious that he possesses organs very
large, brown and decorative."
Lang goes on remorselessly: "Who
has not seen a dog morally corrupt a
familyâreducing them to the slaves
of his impulses? Tip wants to take a
walk; Tip wants to go out of the door;
then he wants to come in again; then
he appears at the window and
scratches; then he fancies the most
comfortable arm chair and ousts a
jaded and middle-aged man of letters."
Lang dismisses all the noble dogs of
history as myths. And to show that
he is disposed to be perfectly Just, he
says: "Any circumstances of an ex
tenuating character which affect the
dog would be here mentioned If I could
think of them."
It seems that this tirade against
dogs, though now published for the
first time, was written by Lang five
yean ago or more. The author says
that it made Robert Louis Stevenson
giggle when he was very ill, so he
(Lang) thinks It can't be so very bad.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY*, JANUARY 20, 1905.
THRIFT SHOWN
BY JAPANESE
Salesmen Follow in the
Wake of the Mikado's
Armies in Manchuria
WARES FOE NATIVES
War-Swept Province Flood
ed With the Product of the
Manufactories of Nippon
HUANSHAN, Jan. 19.âA consider
able Increase has been noticeable the
last few days in the range of the Jap
anese artillery. This fact affords
ground for the belief that part of the
heavy guns used in the siege of Port
Arthur have been sent north. Chinese
confirm this and even designate points
of probable concentration of Japanese
siege guns. It is not believed, however,
that any nine or eleven-inch guns have
arrived and been placed in position.
The Japanese are utilising the Sin
mlntin Railway not only for the for
warding of military supplies, but also
to flood the province of Mukden, by the
aid of Chinese, with goods of Japanese
and American origin, which find ready
sale, owing to the lack of others.
NORTH SJEA INQUIRY BEGUN.
British Charges and Russian Reply
Heard by Commission.
PARIS, Jan. 19.âThe international
commission to-day began the investi
gation of the North Sea affair. In the
British statement read to the commis
sion the principal charges were as fol
lows:
On the night in question there were not any
warships whatever in the neighborhood of the
fishing fleet except those of the Russian navy.
No warships had been seen by the fishing
boats since a long time previous. *
-None, of the boats making up the fishing
fleet carried any kind of material of war.
No Japanese warship of any kind whatever
was at that moment In the North Sea.
There were not many Japanese upon the
fishing boats.
The Russian fire continued after their
searchlights clearly showed the vessels were
peaceful fishing boats.
None of the Russian ships gave or even of
fered assistance.
The fire killed two men, wounded six, sank
one boat and damaged five others.
Following are the principal points
of the Russian reply:
At about midnight the flagship Kniaz Sou
varoff saw the outlines of two small boats,
which approached with all lights extinguished,
directly toward the battleship.
When the two suspicious boats came within
range of the Ruesian searchlights they were
recognized as torpedo boats. Thereupon the
battleship opened fire.
Thereafter a number of small Ashing boats
not showing the required lights were ob
served. Precautionary measures were adopted
nevertheless. There was a strong feeling of
danger upon the battleships and the imper
vious duty of protecting themselves against
the attack of torpedo boats obliged a continu
ance of the fire, despite the evident risks of
hitting not only the fishing boats, but also the
ships of the squadron Itself which had ar
rived within the zone of the fire.
In the meantime the two torpedo boats drew
off and shortly afterward disappeared. Fearing
that some of the fishing boats were damaged,
yet being certain that all danger from the two
torpedo boats or possibly others was not com
pletely removed, Admiral Rojestvenskv con
sidered it indispensable for the tntfi'e squad
ron to continue Its route without stopping.
Admiral Rojeetvensky, while taking Into
account the damage caused to inoffensive fish
ermen, subjects of a neutral power, neverthe
less was compelled to use all the means in his
power to destroy the torpedo boats which at
tacked his squadron.
ALLEGED TRAITOR ON TRIAL.
Accused of Having Sold War Secrets
to Russian Generals.
YOKOHAMA, Jan. 19.â H. B. Col
lins, a man of Portuguese blood but
who has long been a resident of Ja
pan, was publicly tried to-day on the
charge of disclosing military secrets.
The evidence showed that Collins vis
ited Port Arthur and Tientsin last
year and received 1000 yen from Gen
erals Ogorodinkoff and Desino, to
gether with a private cipher that he
might transmit information.
Last October Collins wrote from
Yokohama detailing the proposed dis
patch of Japanese troops, giving their
number, their destination and their
purpose to General Desino, but the
letter was stopped at Nagasaki.
The maximum penalty for the of
fense is six years' imprisdnment. The
passing of sentence was deferred un

TAXATION LAWS
NEED REVISION
Professor Plehn Discusses
Methods of Collection at
the Assessors' Convention
SOURCES OF REVENUE
Says Burden of Our Unequal
System Falls Too Heavily
Upon Owners of Property
1
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19. âThe pro
posed revision of the taxation laws of
the State was the subject of an ad
dress delivered to-night in the As
sembly chamber of the Capitol before
the delegates to the County Assessors'
convention and the members of the
Senate and Assembly committees on
Revenue and Taxation by Professor
Carl C. Plehn. head of the depart
ment of economics of the University
of California. Governor Pardee was
present at the meeting, as were nearly
all the State officials having offices at
the Capitol.
Professor Plehn first contrasted the
commercial and industrial conditions
of the United States when the consti
tution was adoped with the modern
complexities involved in property
holdings and the resulting problems
which are presented in the collection
of taxes. Continuing he said:
It is enough to study the tax roll to show
that personal property escapes taxation to a
very great extent. The kinds of property
which notably escapes are bank deposits and
merchandise. The present system 6f taxation
excuses to a great extent the crime of per
jury.
The first remedy for this state of affairs is
to lay the blame on the County Assessors. An
other remedial scheme income tax. But
our experiments in taxing Incomes have sig
nally tailed. But there ought to be some way
to get at a man's income without putting him
to the trouble of a sworn statement. Instead
of treating all, property alike In our tax sys
tem, admit differences and go after each In
terest.
The Governor in his message has suggested
the separation of sources of revenue for the
cities and State. Let cities tax their own
real estate and let the State keep its hands oC.
California now derives <>!t,uuo.otiv oi iaxt-Â»
in revenue, of which $6,000,000 Is a direct tax.
We could raise $750,000 by direct Inheritance
taxes instead of 1250,000, as we* do now by
our collateral inheritance tax.
Taxation of corporations is another natural
source of revenues in States where State and
county taxes are separated. California should
derive $3,000,000 from corporation tax?*. Anoth
er source which might be well considered Is
State liquor licenses. There are about ."iO.OOO
saloons in this State and a revenue of $50 for
â each quarter for each saloon would yield the
State a large income. Stamp taxes might be
another source. Billiard-rooms and bowling
alleys and fees for the registration of com
pulsory annual reports of corporations are some
other sources that might bf taxed. These
make a total of $8,000,000 in revenue which is
largely unaffected by our present taxation
system. At present the owners of real estat-s
pay 85 per cent of the taxes of this State.
The burden of our unequal system fulls too
heavily upon this species of property.
It is said that Professor Plehn
voiced the Governor's sentiments and
that his remarks constitute a compre
hensive outline of the tax legislation
the chief executive will advocate.
_I Â«
STATE INSTITUTIONS.
legislature Will Look* Into the Cost
of Their Maintenance.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 19.âThe man
agement of the State institutions will
engage more than passing attention of
the Legislature. Facts and figures re
lating to maintenance, the cost of pur
chasing or generating electricity, the
amplitude of water supply and the cul
tivation of land will be carefully i
studied.
The directors of the Veterans' j
Home, Napa County, have indicated a
desire that as many members of the
Legislature as possible shall visit that
institution. Object lessons may there
be found as to what can be done by
a public institution in the way of pro
viding its own electric light and power,
in heating buildings by steam and de
veloping an independent supply of
water. In the powerhouse of this in
stitution oil is used for fuel. The j
modern hospital, library, billiard
rooms, cottages, stables, avenues and ;
grounds are amply provided with elec- i
trie light at one-half the money it |
would cost to buy the same degree of
light from a public company. All the
ice used is manufactured on the prem
ises. The dam and reservoirs consti- I
tute an independent water supply. A
herd of cows supply the 800 members
with milk. The cost per capita for the
maintenance of the Veterans' Home Is
40 cents a day. The United States in
spectors place the institution in the
foremost place among State homes, its
only rival being the New York home.
The daily cost per capita in other in- I
stitutions of this State is given as fol
lows: Folsom prison, 44 cents; San j
Quentin prison, 31 cents; Whittler Re
form School, 79 cents; Preston School
of Industry; 90 cents; Home for Adult j
Blind, 64 cents; Deaf, Dumb and Blind
Asylum, 75 cents; Stockton State Hos- i
pital, 36 cents; Napa State Hospital, j
39 cents; Agnew State Hospital, 30
cents; Mendocino State HospitaL 47
cents; Southern California State Hos
pital, 60 cents; Home for Feeble
minded, 49 cents.
In the tables of 1903 giving the an
nual per capita expense of State homes
for soldiers and sailors, Illinois, with
$121, is the lowest and North Dakota,
$419, is the highest. California rates
at $159; New York, $136: Massa
chusetts, $215; Pennsylvania, $188;
lowa, $211; Indiana, $245; Rhode |
Island, $236; New Hampshire, $276;
Minnesota, $204; Missouri, $177; Ohio, :

ROW DISTURBS
MINERS' MEETING
Delegate Casts Aspersions
on Honesty and Integrity
of President John Mitchell
WARM WORDS FOLLOW
Leader Defends Andrew Car
negie and Gives His Opin
ion of Grover Cleveland
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Jan. 19.âThe
management of the Colorado strike
wus bitterly argued to-day on the floor
of the National Convention of the Unit
ed Mine Workers. Delegate Robert
Randall of Wyoming took the floor and
spoke for an hour. He charged that
President Mitchell had sold out the
miners' organization in the recent Col
orado strike and attacked the financial
integrity of the president. His speech
was filled with personal abuse of Pres
ident Mitchell and was directed at him,
as Randall took the platform and faced
Mitchell while he made the charges.
The delegates tried to silence Randall
several times, but Mitchell rapped for
order and Insisted that Randall be
heard.
When the mine workers met to-day
the Socialistic question came up, but
the convention again refused to allow
the organisation to be committed to
Socialism. President Mitchell then
took the floor and defended the leaders
of the Civic Federation, when a dele
gate named Randall, from Wyoming,
shouted that the leaders were Grover
Cleveland, whom every laboring man
detests: Frank Robbins of Pittsburg,
who has made millions by beating
down his miners, and Andrew Car
negie, whose hands are red with the
blood of the Homestead strikers.
President Mitchell showed his anger
and said:
"I have heard of this man Randall
before. He is a delegate who, in the
local union at Diets, Utah, got up and
said that John Mitchell had sold out
to the operators in the Colorado strike.
I had intended to call him to account
In this convention for that statement,
and I Intend to make him prove his as
sertions."
Continuing, Mitchell said: "t do not
stand here to defend Andrew Car
negie or Grover Cleveland. But who
in America ever made a speech so fa
vorable to organized labor as Andrew
Carnegie, who, In that banquet, said
that if his men went out on strike he
would shut down his plant and wait
for them to come back, and would not
employ a 'scab.' As for Grover Cleve
land, I do not like him. He is not a
leading light, as charged. In the fed
eration. He never even looked in on
that meeting."

WARM DEBATE
ON ARMY BILL
Representative Humphrey
Denounces Entire Trans
port Service as "Rotten*
COSTING TOO DEARLY
"It Is a National Disgrace"
the Washington Congress
man Declares in House
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.âThe House
of Representatives to-day completed
consideration of the army appropria
tion bill, and will vote on the measure
to-morrow. During the debate Resi
dent Commissioner Degetau of Porto
Rico made his first speech in the
House. He praised the United States
for Its attitude toward his island home.
He said he saw no need for the main
tenance of the provisional regiment of
troops in the island.
A vigorous attack was made by
Humphrey of Washington on the
transport service. M|ls first move was
to eliminate from the bill, on a point
of order, which was sustained, the pro
vision that "no steamship in the trans
port service shall be disposed of with
out the consent of Congress."
Humphrey offered an amendment
striking out the provision for expenses
of sailing Government transports. He
said the transport service was costing
$1,500,000 a year more to maintain than
would be the case if the service were
performed by private companies.
When Root was Secretary of War he
had recommended its abolishment, as
had General Davis when he was Gover
nor of the Philippines, and Humphrey
said Secretary Taft was of the same
mind. The transport service so far had
cost the country between $35,000,000 and
$40,000,000.
"Everything is rotten in this trans
port service," hotly declared Hum
phrey, "from the hulls of the old for
elgn-bullt vessels to the wonderful sys
tem of bookkeeping adopted by the
quartermaster's department. It is a
national disgrace and I hope this
House will stop It."
Hull defended the service. He said
if for no other reason the service
ought to be maintained for the com
fort of the soldiers, especially the sick,
who were brought home from the Phil
ippines. He denied that the service was
more expensive than private service
would have been.
The amendment of Humphrey was
defeated on a viva voce vote.

however, did he hit on the idea which
. â¢is embodied in the machine with which
;' he is now experimenting.
f MACHINE VERSUS MACHINE.
' "I have studied every known system,"
he says, "and have found their weak
â¢ points. I have invented a machine to
tight a machine. It does away with
â¢ the laws of chance, and by its use I
can. stand a week of steady bad luck

and, .sitting down at one of the tables,
, â¢ produced a quantity of silver coins and
the "luck machine," whose perform
. a noes are now the chief topic of con
versation here. He followed the play
_ 'at the tables for a short time, closely
."'Watching the disks of his machine, and
â¢â¢ then played and won. Then he changed
';â .'â¢. â¢the .disks by touching a spring on the
. ! box; played, and won a second time,
â¢.'.whereupon a crowd gathered around
â l" his chair. The croupiers fidgeted and
jriared whirl Wall went on consulting
I â¢ Â°his box before each bet and winning on
â¢ â¢' .the game. As he went on, the crowd
I. J..'grew larger and several officials of the
Casino also gathered to see the play.
[../!H4ving completed a hundred bets the
sportsman picked, up his machine and
â¢ â¢ his-winnings, which amounted to $200,
and left the room.
STREAK OF BAD LUCK.
" '.'Wall's worst luck with his machine
Â»' 'â¢ came to him on the day after Christ
nras.. when for two hours he played
â¢ with all the chances dead against him.
.. ~-Sero turned up three times and Wall,
. w ho began by staking $1 at a time, was
'â ' ultimately obliged to stake $125 at each

.â Poemed an almost impossible battle,
.. f/'Ughl his way back almost to the
â¢. â¢; 'starting point and at the close was
â â¢' only $50 to the bad.
: . â¢ Old players here declare that they
. 'h/tve. never seen anything like Wall's
.. play and are of the opinion that the ex
.'. perjence just described would have
. .Droken him if he had played any known
system. The officials at Monte Carlo
\ â¢ .requested the Englishman to exhibit
â¢: '. 'the .machine to them and he complied
/ . with' their request. It is believed that
â¢i they.are not entirely at ease regarding
' w hat Wall may accomplish when he
â¢ begins really serious work, but thus far
'â¢ .they have made no attempt to prevent
: : him. from .using his invention.
Wall says that his "luck machine"
'.' represents the play of sixty-four per
â  â¢ sons fighting simultaneously against
;he bank on a preconcerted plan, each
â¢' move of each of the players being de
cided beforehand. He says that it was
impossible mentally to control this
â¢ - . number of players and that he first ex
â¢' perimented with eight, but even this
'.â¢' proved unsatisfactory, as eight sets of
'. - calculations could not be made between
â¢canh turn of the wheel. So he deter
mined to invent a machine which
would make the calculations mechani
cally. He says that if sixty-three of his!
players lose and one of them wins heJ
'comes out even. If sixty-two lose and I
-two win, he wins sixty-fouA units on {
. the balance. The game carr be played !
â¢ with anything from a $1 to a $20 unit,
and unlike all other systems, its inven
â¢â¢ tor says, it never runs into really big
. -figures even under the worst of bad j
luck. Wall's exact method of play he
:' . keeps a secret, but his plan is to gam
â¢ . ble on all the simple chances at rou
â¢ lette. He ignores "zero," which he says
does not affect the ultimate Issue.

Denver Paper Describes the
Manner in Which the Uin
tah Acres Were Cornered
DENVER, Jan. 19.âFollowing up its
expose of the alleged Uintah land grab,
the.Post to-night reviews the history of
the affair. John Gilson, after whom
gilsonite is named, located the beds on
the reservation in 1885. Through C. W.
Baxter of St. Louis he interested
Adolphus Busch and his associates in
the brewing company. They formed
the Gilson Asphaltum Company, and in
18S6 it purchased from the Govfrnment
a tract south of Fort Duchesne for
$16,000, which has been almost worked
out.
In 1887 Congress empowered the In
dians to grant leases subject to the ap
proval of the Secretary of the Interior.
Then the American Asphalt Company
was formed by New York men and it
secured leases to 322,000 acres of land
inside the reservation. The two com
panies began a fight which resulted in
the absorption of the leases the latter
held ultimately by the Raven Mining
Company, formed by the Busch syndi
cate. Later the same men formed the
Florence Mining Company. It secured
a lease on 640 acres of land in the Uin
tah Mountains. Then, according to the
Post, the Busch syndicate began an in
vasion of the Uncompahgre reserva
tion, to the east of the Uintah tract, to
secure control of the elaterite fields.
It is alleged that there was much
lobbying at Washington and that after
it secured the claims of many people on
the Uncompahgre tract Senator Kearns
secured the passage of a bill validating
these rights, which were questioned at
the time. It Is alleged that other legis
lation has been secured through a pow
erful lobby and the expenditure of
large sums, clinching the hold of the
syndicate on the gilsonite and elaterite
deposits. The prominent men whose
names have been connected with the
case are alleged to be identified with
either the Raven or the Florence com
panies, which are controlled by the
same interests. In conclusion, the Post
says:
"Three weeks ago the Gllson Asphalt
jum Company of St. Louis was dis
j solved, but all its holdings had previ
j ously been transferred to the American
Asphalt Company of New Jersey, a
j Barber concern. In other words, Busch
and Barber have Joined hands and are
preparing to continue the fight for
Utah's minerals with unabated vigor."

ROONEY WILL
NOT GENUINE
Judge Coffey Declines to
. Admit Alleged Testament
of Old Woman to Probate
â¦
"It is the court's opinion, after a
very careful and laborious examina
tion, that the paper is not genuine,
and it is denied probate."
These words, in effect a judgment
that some one has been guilty of at
tempting to perpetrate a forgery upon
the court, concludes an eight-page
opinion, written by Judge Coffey, in
deciding the contest against the alleged
Wills of Mary Rooney.
Mary Rooney was a working woman
who accumulated about $3000 in her life
time of toil. She suffered a stroke of
paralysis and died in January of last
year. In February her sister, Bridget
Spafford, applied for letters of admin
istration upon the estate, and in March
Mary Ryan, with whom Mrs. Rooney
had lived, presented what purported to
be two wills. Mrs. Spafford contested
their admission to probate, and a trial
followed, in which it was charged that
the instruments were not genuine. Both
papers were dated October 8, 1903,
after the stroke of paralysis. One of
them related to burial and expressed a
desire that the sister should have noth
ing to do with the affairs of the de
ceased. The other purported to dispose
of the propertyâa lot to a nephew,
some bequests for masses, $50 to Father
Grant, $400 to Mrs. Ryan and $100 each
to Mrs. Catherine Conroy and Mrs.
Elizabeth Bradley, who signed as wit
nesses to the will. It was contended
that both papers were written and
signed at the same time.
In the trial it was proved that Mrs.
Rooney had not met Father Grant un
til a month after the will was made, al
though he was well known to Mr.
Ryan. The court, In comparing the
two documents and those with exem
plars of admittedly genuine handwrit
ing of the deceased, found that both
could not have been written and signed
by the same hand. There were many
resemblances between letters and
Words In the exemplars and the alleged
wills, but the court declared it would
have been unwise to 'attempt to palm
off a fabricated instrument unless there
was a more or less close imitation of
the genuine handwriting. It was in
stanced that on the back of some of
Mrs. Rooney's acknowledged writings
there were evidences of the effort of
some penman to imitate certain letters.
Among the discrepancies in the wills
themselves were different ways of
making the letter "M"; Roonev was
spelled "Rooney" and "roney"; the
words "one" and "wan" appeared, and
there were interlineations in a different
hand.

cash ball and each of the others on $10.

MYSTERY
SOLVED BY
DETECTIVE
Miss Gertrude Wells, Who
Disappeared From the St.
Francis. Is Traced to an
Apartment at California
REMAINS SECLUDED
FOB SEVERAL DAYS
Sick and Despondent She Is
Comforted by Her Friends,
Who Arrange for Her De
parture for South To-Day
Miss Gertrude Wells, whose strange
j disappearance several days ago from
i her apartments at the St. Francis
j Hotel caused deep concern among her
J friends, has been found. Yesterday
| the unfortunate young woman, sick in
j body and mind, was discovered at the
j California Hotel, where she had been
| living for several days, remaining the
! most of the time in her room and
j brooding over troubles, the nature of
j which she refuses to reveal to the
! public.
| The story of Miss Wells' strange ab
; sente from the St. Francis Hotel, as
1 published in yesterday's Call, aroused
'â  great interest among her friends in
| this city, who had known her years
I ago. and they joined in a search for
' the missing woman that eventually led
I them to her temporary abode at the
' California. Having afforded her every
j possible comfort they returned to the
j St. Francis and settled her bill and
j then gathered together from her
j trunks such articles as she would need
j and sent them to her. Later in the
j day they arranged for her departure
| this morning for Ix>s Angeles, whither.
! she goes in search of health and \lhere
; she will be cared for by loving friends
ior her school doys.
Miss Wells' sister, Mrs. Fred Web
ster, yesterday telegraphed from New
; York to a friend at the Palace Hotel
!to make every possible effort to find
I the missing woman and it was partly
through this friend and the assistance
lof House Detective Hershey of the St.
Francis that Miss Wells was found.
! From this friend, who is a- New York
! man, it was learned last evening that
: Miss Wells was not in need of funds
; and the young woman later confirmed
this statement.
In her rooms at the California Miss
! Wells related her experiences during
; her stay in San Francisco, adding that
! she hoped soon to be far beyond the
| city, in which during a very short time
more troubles than she ever expected
to encounter again had been crowded
into her life. Continuing, she said:
1 looked forward to a very happy visit to
California, which had so long; been my home,
j I was sick In New York and finally, on the
I advice of my doctor and urged by my devoted
sister. I planned a Western trip. The over
land Journey did not improve my health and
I I arrived In San Francisco Just before the
; Christmas holidays feeling anything butNcheer
! fui. I was enduring troubles other than those
of Illness, but they are of ho concern to the
! public. The gay scenes at the St. Francs
strangely did not enliven me and the longer
: I remained there the more despondent I be
. came.
Finally I read of the arrest of that un
; fortunate creature. Mrs. McCabe. and as I
! daily perused the stories of her experiences
j i;: the City Prison I began to imagine that
i the world was growing colder and colder.
From this story my mind was suddenly di
verted to the tale of the arrest of Howell
; Caradoc Rees, and as I continued to read of
I that poor fellow's troubles it occurred to me
' that my own tribulations were becoming too
j crcat.
At night I would retire early and listen to
â  the music of the 'Qrcheatra. but when the lat
j ter ceased playing and my mind reverted to
my private affairs I .became so blue that I
i could not sleep. Severn! days ago I rose after
j a restless night and wfit out for a walk. As
I I proceeded along the street I keenly appre
| elated that I was sick and depressed and it
! suddenly occurred to me that a quiet place
jof rest might do me good. I wandered around
ito the California Hotel and entering engaged
; a room. Since then I have been almost ob
| livious to what the outside world was doiifg.
! Yesterday I sent for some newspapers and one
;of the first items that caught my eye was the
i announcement that Mrs. McCabe was oceupy
| ing comfortable quarters In the City Prison.
I Fancy a woman having any comforts In a
| Jail. Later I read of the Issuance of a war
rant charging Rees with Insanity. This morn
ing I sent for more papers and immediately
looked for news of the two unfortunate creat
ures whosa troubles had so interested me.
Instead of finding Reese or Mrs. McCabe head
lined In some part of the newspaper I was
startled by finding my own troubles published
to the world. Later I met my friends and
through them I paid my bill at the St. Fran
cis and arranged for my trip to Los Angeles.
I cm going to Southern California in hope of
recovering my health.
Miss Wells, who appeared in buoy
ant spirits last evening as she talked
with a Call reporter, said that she re
gretted the publicity she had gained
and especially the fact that her sister's
name had been used in the affair. She
also regretted that Attorney Hoefler
had been annoyed. Concerning the
statement published yesterday that
Mrs. Webster had advised Attorney
Hcefler to look out for her and that
the lawyer was ready to advance her
funds, Miss Wells said:
My sister has always been very deeply con
cerned in my welfare. No doubt she was
anxious that I should enjoy every possible
comfort during my stay In San Francisco and i
furnished Attorney Hoefler with money to meet I
any possible emergency . that might arise
should I be taken seriously Ul. Fortunately
I am not without funds and will not find It
necessary to appeal to my sister or hÂ«r at
torney.

Sidewalk Lines Established.
As the result of the resurvey of the
lines of Sansome, Merchant and Clay
streets, made by City Engineer Wood
ward, the building proposed to be
erected at the corner of Sansome and
Clay streets by the Cowell estate will
have to be set back eighteen inches
frcm the sidewalk line. The lines
have been in dispute for several
months and investigation disclosed
that while the architects of the build
ing were about to encroach eighteen
inches on Sansome street they were
entitled to eighteen inches more of
frontage on the Clay-street side, thus
making up for the loss of ground on
Sansomte street. All the houses on
Sansome street project on the side
walk line as officially designated, one
building encroaching as much as
twenty-one inches. City Architect
Shea took steps several weeks ago to
prevent further operations on the
buildings pending the settlement of
the sidewalk lines.

New York Manager Declares
That Blanche Bates Will

Says He Will Buy a Theater

Able to Lease a Playhouse
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 19.â"Play
Portland at any price. If you can't
rebuild the Lyric, lease a theater. If
you can't lease, buy one."
â¢ The above message from David Be
lasco in New York was received to
day by M. B. Kirby, agent for Blanche
Bates, who has been threatened by
the theater trust with disbarment for
playing in her home city. It was
found on closer study that the pro
posed rebuilding of the Lyric,, ar
vaudeville house, could not be accom
plished in the time required. Even
the sanguine contractor who promised
to do the big task finally acknowl
edged he had overestimated his abil
ity.
The plan is now to lease the Grand,
one of the oldest playhouses, which
was recently enlarged and fitted up
by Sullivan and Considine.
The local manager of the Grand
i says: "If Blanche Bates plays at the
j Grand her management will have to
I make good the salaries of the vaude

I the salaries of the house employes,
our regular weekly profit and a big
j rental besides. It will cost Belasco
j not a cent less than $5000, and pos
! sibly more."

PUTTING IT STRONG.
But Doesn't It Look Reasonable?
This may read as though we were
putting it a little strong, because it is
generally thought by the majority of
people that Dyspepsia in its chronic
form Is incurable or practically so.
But we have long since shown that
Dyspepsia is curable, nor is it such
a difficult matter as at first appears.
The trouble with Dyspeptics Is that
they are constantly dieting, starving
themselves or going to the opposite
extreme or else deluging the already
overburdened stomach with "bitters,"
"after dinner pills," etc., which in
variably increase the dffflculty, even
if in some cases they do give a slight
temporary relief. Such treatment of
the stomach simply makes matters
worse. What the stomach wants Is a
rest. Now how can the stomach be
come rested, recuperated and at the
same time the body nourished and
sustained?
This is a great secret and this is
also the secret of the uniform success
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. This is
a comparatively new remedy, but its
success and popularity leave no doubt
as to its merit.
The Tablets will digest the food
anyway, regardless of condition of
stomach. The sufferer from Dyspep
sia, according to directions, is to eat
an abundance of good, wholesome
food and use the tablets before and
after each meal, and the result will
be that the food will be digested, no
matter how bad your Dyspepsia may
be, because, as before stated, the tab
lets will digest the food, even if the
stomach Is wholly Inactive. To illus
trate our meaning plainly, if you take
1800 grains of meat, eggs or ordinary
food and place it in a temperature of
98 degrees and put with it one of Stu
art's Dyspepsia Tablets it will digest
the meat or eggs almost as perfectly
as If the meat was inclosed within the
stomach.
The stomach may be ever so weak,
yet these tablets will perform the
work of digestion and the body and
brain will be properly nourished and
at the same time a radical, lasting
cure of Dyspepsia will be made be
cause the much abused stomach will
be given, to some extent, a much
needed rest. Your druggist win tell
you that of all the many remedies ad
vertised to cure Dyspepsia none of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1905.
GREAT SPECTACLE "MOTHER
GOOSE" TO BE SEEN HERE
Klnw & Erlanger's Beautiful and
Costly Production Coming to
Grand Opera-House.
It is claimed that when Klaw & Er
langer's mighty beauty spectacle,
"Mother Goose," Is seen In this city
at the Grand Opera-house, Monday,
February 6, all theatrical record*
will be broken so far as to the size of
the organization, the magnitude of the
production, the beauty of the scenic
environment and the gorgeousness of
costuming, for in "Mother Goose" we
are promised the very climax in the
atrical achievement.
An idea of the immensity of this
production may be gleaned from the
fact that more than 400 comedians,
singers, dancers and pantomimists ap
pear in it, and seventeen scenes, each
as elaborate as an entire ordinary pro
duction, are used. The costumes num
ber 2000 and cost alone $75,000 to
produce. "Mother Choose" ran an en
tire year in London- and all last year
in New York City at the New Amster
dam Theater. It is thte first play of its
class ever presented in this city and
is described as being the mightiest ex
position of beauty, quick, rattling fun,
charming melody and spectacular
magnificence known to theatrical his
tory. Its production in this city will
be the original cast and every detail
of gorgeousness which made the pre
sentation one of the most talked of
theatrical events of the past two years
in the United States.

KILLS HIMSELF
BEFORE WIFE
Montana Newspaper Man
Tires of Struggle Against
111 Health and Takes Life
VICTDLOF MELANCHOLIA
Despondent Writer Sends
Bullet Through Brain and
Falls Across Baby's Crib
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUTTE, Jan. 19.âAt about 5 o'clock
this morning, on the sixth anniversary
of his marriage, Daniel J. Walsh, one
of the best known newspaper men of
Montana, sent a bullet crashing
through his brain at his home in the
presence of his horrified wife. Walsh
fell across the crib within which his
little daughter was sleeping peaceful
ly, and never regained consciousness,
passing quietly away at 10 o'clock. The
reason for the young man's rash deed
can only be explained by a sudden at
tack ol melancholia, brought about
by miserable health.
Walsh arrived "at the house about i
o'clock, his work on the Anaconda
Standard keeping him out until after
3. Mrs. Walsh had retired, but awoke
when her husband came in. She no
ticed he was unusually cheerful con
sidering his health and conduct for the
past few weeks, and the fact impressed
her greatly. He remarked happily
upon the day being the anniversary of
their marriage, which had been a most
happy one, and talked excitedly of the
futureâhow brave he meant to be. He
seemed to be without a care in the
world, and as to-day was to have been
his day off he talked of spending it at
home in the company of his family.
Walsh finally undressed and got into
bed. Then his demeanor seemed to
change. He began talking of his sick
ness. Finally he arose, and, remark
ing that he had made up his mind to
end It all, told Mrs. Walsh he intend
ed to kill her and the baby and finish
up himself. Frightened at his wild '
mannd, Mrs. Walsh pleaded with her
husband to b% calm and go back to
bed; but he got up and, procuring his
revolver, remarked:
'You may think this Is a bluff, but
just to show you I mean it here goes."
andÂ» placing the muzzle of the revolver
to his right temple pulled the trigger.
Walsh was formerly city editor of
the' Washington Times, Denver News
and Butte Inter Mountain.
Woman Reports an Assault.
Mary McGill, a waitress in the Puri
tai restaurant and a recent arrival In
the city from Tulare County, reported
to the police last night that she had
been brutally assaulted by a man in
her room at 203 Powell street. After
Miss McGill gave a description of the
man, whose name was unknown to
her, the* police arrested "Denny"
Doyle, a tenderloin character, who has
been in trouble on many occasions.
When Doyle was brought to headquar
ters Miss McGill positively identified
him as her assailant.
Run Over by a Wagon.
While crossing Market street, near
Sixth, last night J. D. Blackman was
run down by an express wagon. He
was taken to the Central Emergency
Hospital, where it was found that six
of his ribs were broken and that he
was suffering from Internal injuries
that may result fatally. The teamster,
a Japanese named M. Suzukawa, was
arrested and charged with battery.

"TRAVIATA"
AT THE TIVOLI
A GREAT HIT
Real clothes at the Tivoli, a "Travia-
I ta" that ripped, and the largest houseâ j
! bar that of "Lucia"âof the season last !
i night. Nothing could better illustrate
I the commercial value of the star sys- ,
j tern than the houses of the last and
j preceding nights. "Manon" was an ;
j opera practically new to Tivoli goers,
j Half a house greeted itâtrue, there
j was much weather outside. "La |
| Traviata," that one has been accus- j
j tomed to regard as a hackneyed, thin J
! enough vehicle for the human lark, |
j with Tetrazzini, crammed the theater, j
! Practically the season has divided it- i
j self into Tetrazzini nights and other I
j nights. When Tetrazzini sings the !
people will go whether Mr. Verdi, Mr. j
Bizet or any one else made the opera, j
and no matter how he made it. The
attitude is not artistic but perfectly
i natural. One can very fully excuse it ;
while Tetrazzani sings, for her every j
appearance only makes It more!
apparent that here indeed is an ex- j
traordinary singer, a rare vocal pre- [
j ciousness.
As to "La Traviata," last night's
J reading and rendering suggest a new
i deal in opinions. In the finely respect
i ful interpretation of Signor Pollacco
j the careless old "turn-turn" took on
i astonishing grace and distinction. It
i sparkled: it thrilled. Irredeemably and
I poorly mechanical one has become used
!to believing much of the orchestral
i work âso it has been sawed off for us.
j The effects have been stamped as for
; mal in the hopeless way. One has ex
! pected nothingâand usually has got it.
j Last night It was different. Even Pol-
I lacco thought so, I think. That modest
; gentleman, for the first time since his
i introduction here, acknowledged a cur
i tain call, as many, in fact, as time per
mitted. And one was never better de
served. Every phrase, every note of
the opera was charged with meaning,
the whole thing gathering significance,
picturesqueness, dramatic Intensity, as
with no other "Traviata" of my expe
rience. May I add my "brava" to the
thousands of last night, Signor Pol
lacco?
TetraÂ»ini contributed tremendously
to the dramatic illusion. The woes of
Violetta became actually human In her
Interpretation. All the vocal embroid
ery was most deftly fitted to the dra
matic need. A really extraordinary ex
ample of this was the scene between
Violetta and Alfredo's father (excel
lently done by Signor Romboli). One
would have quite forgotten here that
the actor's speech was song but for the
beauty of the speech, so wonderfully
little did it interfere with the dramatic
intention. The tears in Tettrazzini's
eyesâreal, home-made tears âwere not
the only ones in the Tivoli just then.
The scene was eminently touching,
played with a sincerity and conviction
that carried all before It. But through
out Tetrazzini showed herself an ac
tress of admirable resource and accom
plishment. Further, she sang, how she
did sing! I'm waiting for Melba.
Melba comes on the 7th of February;
j these singers finish at the Tivoli on the
I same date. We will see then. The
i quality of the Tetrazzini voice is Mel
ba's exactly, as I remember it. The
Melba voice comes no more purely in
|my memory. I think Melba has It in
power, has It again in sheer, dazzling,
technical fluency, but the comparison
imposes itself. If It is not sacrilegious
one. would like also to express gratitude
to Tetrazzini for her most un-grand
opera-like charming gowns.
Signor Colli was the Alfredo, and I
wish one had such a good time about it
as he evidently has. He filled in enthu
siastically. The chorus counted hand
somely last night, the climax of the
gaming scene being, in the circum
stances, a miracle of ensemble.
To-night "Manon," with Berlindiâa
dainty opera, cleverly acted, well sung.

Committee in Favor of the
Passage of Proposed Bill.
PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE LOWER HOUSE OF THE STATE LEGISLA-
Tt'RE NOW IN SESSION AT SACRAMENTO. WHO TAKE AN ACTIVE IN
TEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE GENERAL BODY.
Special Dlsr>at.:h to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19.âBefore the
Judiciary Committee of the Assembly
this afternoon there was a battle over
the bill introduced by McGowan in
creasing the salaries of the # Superior
Judge's of San Francisco from $4000 to
$6000 a year. Other Assemblymen
wished to get aboard and secure raises
tor the Judges of the counties repre
â¢ sented by them. Espey of Alameda
demanded an amendment raising the
salary of the Judges of his county to
$6000. Houser asked that the Los An
geles salary rate be fixed at the same
figure, King of Napa wanted an in
crease from $3000 to $4000 for Judge
Gesford and Pryor wanted Judge Short
of Kings put on the $4000 list.
Treadwell and McGowan put up the
fight for the San Francisco judiciary,
and won out to the extent that the
committee decided to report the bill
favorably as it stoodâproviding for an
increase for the San Francisco Judges
only.
The contention made by the San
Franciscans was not against raising
the salaries of Judges outside of their
city. They said these raises should be
. made, but that they would have to be
made gradually, and that If everybody
tried to secure an advance this session,
' none of them would succeed. They said
that as no Judge now in office could
benefit by the increase none outside of
San Francisco could receive extra com
pensation in less than four years, and
that the San Francisco Judges elected
two years from now would draw salary
-under the new schedule.
It seems likely that some of the
amendments offered in committee will
be insisted upon on the ftbor, and that
there will be a fight over th? passage
of the bill as it stands.
The Senate and Assembly committees
on Capital and Labor met in joint ses
â¢ slon this afternoon and evening, and
reported favorably the bill limiting the
day's labor of firemen to twelve
hours and providing that no drug clerk
shall be compelled to work more than
ten hours each. day. The bill carries an
AUVERTIbKMEXTS.
Dizzy Spells
That dizzy spell is an important mes
sage from the heart âa plea for help.
If this message receives no attention
others come. Shortness of breath, palpi

the heart, in side or shoulders, and so
on, untU it receives the necessary help,
or is compelled to give upâstop.
You may furnish this aid with
Dr. Miles' Heart* Cure
Which cures heart disease in every stage.
Every day we read of sudden deaths
from heart disease, yet it is a fact that
the heart had been pleading for help, and
gave up the struggle only when it had
exhausted the last spark of vitalityâand
they call it sudden.
"For more than six years I was trou
bled with my heart. I would have dizzy
â pells, then difficulty in breathing, chok
ing sensations, my heast would flutter,
become painful. I could npt breathe ly
ing down. I commenced taking Dr.
Miles' Heart Cure, and in a few weeks I
was entirely cured,"âMINNIE E. JOHN
SON. Olivia, Minn.

amendment that will do away with the
present law making it a misdemeanor
to entice an employe away from his
employer. The child labor bill, which
raises the age limit of children that
may be employed from twelve to four
teen years, prohibits night work by
such children later than 10 o'clock, and
provides a simple educational test for
children between fourteen and sixteen
jears, was also recommended.
Senator Nelson presided. Congress
man-elect Kahn spoke for the drug
gists and Senators Wolfe and Keane
for. the firemen and the child labor
bills.
The bill relating to the hours of fire
men was amended on motion of Sena
tor Savage of San Pedro to take in Los
Angeles.
President Wheeler of the State Uni
versity appeared before the University
Committee at its meeting to-day.
Chairman Waste's bill asking for $250,
--000 for an Agricultural College build
ing and that of Assemblyman Hawkins
asking for a like sum for an agricul
tural farm were reported favorably to
the Ways and Means Committee.
At President Wheeler's request
Pfaeffle's bill creating a chair of music
at the university was approved.
ATTACHE WORKS TOO HARD.
Bill Filer From San Fr.incisco Sud-
denly Springs Into Prominence.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19. âAi* at
tache of the Legislature has hurt him
self working. M. Dannenbaum of
San Francisco, a bill filer, is the man
who has thus sprung into prominence.
A special committee of the legislative
attaches' organization has been ap
pointed to in% f estigate the case and if
Dannenbaum is found guilty he will
be disciplined and probably expelled
from that body.
Dannenbaum inflicted injury on
himself by using a patent i/unch with
which to make holes in bills. He
bruised the palm of his hand, but
continued to pursue his duties assid
uously, with the result that his arm
began to swell. Tuesday night the
arm was in such a bad condition that
he sent for a physician, who told him
he must quit using the punch. Yes
terday morning Dannenbaum reported
his condition to Sergeant at Arms
Lew Martin.
"Why did you allow yourself to be
injured?" asked the sergeant at arms
chidingly. He is going through his
first session. "You should never hurt
yourself here. You should have spo
ken to me sooner."
The tale of Dannenbaum's strange
case soon spread in official circles
and he was the recipient of many at
tentions. A large basket of flowers,
which, it is said, came from Governor
Pardee, was sent to his room. A res
olution of thanks for his unusual ef
forts in the State's behalf is being
framed and will be presented In the
Senate to-morrow unless another jun
keting measure should be introduced

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 20 ? 1905.
BRIEF SESSION
OF ASSEMBLY
Proposed Trips of Inves
tigation to Distant Points
Still Interest Members
COMMITTEE IS PROMPT
Judiciary Body Recommends
the Passage of Bills Re
lating to Civil Procedure
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19.âTwo shafts
with a deadly appearance but which
will be splintered into several pieces
when the Committee on Rules steps on
them were launched at junketing in the
Assembly this morning. Legislator Gus
Hartman of San Francisco, who is es
pecially interested in the progress of
the breakwater at San Pedro and who
expects to start fur that place Saturday
with the Committee on Commerce and
Navigation, had two distinct strokes of
temporary paralysis as a result of the
resolutions, but McOJowan and others
of the delegation sitting close by
cheered him up and he was rtrong
when time was called.
The first disturbing resolution came
from Cooper of Monterey. It provided
that each of the four committees that
have been given permission to make
trips of investigation select two mem
bers to do the work and that the rest
of the members remain at home. Speak
er Prercott at once referred the reso
lution to the Committee on Rules.
Cleveland of Santa Cruz brought on
the next tremor by Introducing a reso
lution that the committees be allowed
only their actual transportation and no
further expenses. This was also re
ferred to the Committee on Rules.
Mindham of San Francisco produced
a laugh by submitting a resolution
drawn up by Jones of the same city
providing that Assemblymen Cooper,
Cleveland, Chandler and Johnstone,
who are on record as opposing the
Junketing trops, "be appointed a com
mittee to visit the base of Mount Shas
ta and ascertain whether the Govern
ment monuments placed there by the
I'nited States Government in 1553 are
still intact."
"I think the resolution should go to
the t Committee on Ventilation and
Acoustics and that the clerk should
omit to enter it in the Journal," said the
Speaker.
The document was not made a part
of ihe record.
The Judiciary Committee, through its
chairman. Assemblyman Duryea, re
ported a large number of bills for pas
sage. Most of them related to civil
procedure. It is evidenj that legisla
tion is to be facilitated this session by
the prompt work of this committee.
The chairman has lost no time in get
ting it to work, and it has already
glveji attention to a large number of
the bills referred to it. The Assembly,
too, has operated with rapidity during
the times it has been in session to date,
no members having as yet developed a
tendency for captious debate. Later on,
though, when the more important
measures, dealing with diverse inter
ests, come up there will be necessary
debate and the wheels of legislation
will not revolve so fast. "
Anthony's adjournment motion to
day named 10 o'clock as the hour of
convening to-morrow.
PROPOSED FREE MARKET.
Measure Providing for Its Establish
ment Introduced in Both Houses.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19.âA bill
providing for the establishment on the
water front of San Francisco of a free
market for perishable products was
introduced in both houses this morn
ing, Diggs of Marysvlile being its
sponsor in the Senate and Hawkins of
Woodland in the lower house. The
bill has many features different from
any embodied in previous measures of
this nature.
It is provided that the market, if
established, shall be in charge of six
district commissioners and one gen
eral commissioner, who shall be the
president, this commission to be re
sponsible to the Harbor Board. The
district commissioners shall grade all
the goods sent by producers to be
sold and shrill fix the market prices.
Eggs, poultry and butter, it is pro
vided, shall be sold by weight.
Under the terms of the bill the
Board of Harbor Commissioners must
within a year after its passage set
aside the necessary blocks and parts
of blocks on the water front for the
proposed market. The site, it is pro
vided, must be as convenient as pos
sible to the wholesale district, and the
piers and docks to be used must be
accessible to all water craft. Vessels
laden with produce for the market
must be given preference at these
piers. No partiality shall be shown
to any holders of space in the market.
The Harbor Board must inclose the
free market and construct such tram
ways and tracks as may be necessary.
The counties are divided up as fol
lows in the construction of the six dis
tricts:
FirstâDel Norte, Humboldt. Mendocino,
Lake, Olenn, Butte. Plumas, Tehama, Shasta
Lassen, Modoc and Siskiyou.
Second âSonoma, Napa, Marin, Tolo, Co
lusa, Sutter, Yuba, Sierra. Nevada and Placer.
Third âEl Dorado, Alpine, Amador, Calav
eras, Sacramento. San Joaquin, Solano and
Contra Costa-
FourthâSan Mateo, Alameda, Santa Clara.
Santa Cruz, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Mono and
San Francisco.
Fifth âMonterey. San Benito, Merced, Mari
posa. Madera, Fresno, Inyo, Tulare and
Kings,
SixthâSan Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara,
Kern. Ventura. Los Angeles, Orange, Ban Ber
nardino, Riverside and San Diego.
The salary of the president of the
proposed free market commission is
fixed at 13000 a year and his bond at
$100,000. The district commission
ers are to receive $1800 a year each
and their bonds are to be $26,000. All
appointments are to be made by the
Governor. The president is to have
an office at the free market.

DOWN TO WORK
Hold Two Sessions and Give 1
Much Time to Discussion'
of the Junketing Measure ,
CREATES BIG SURPRISE
Shortridge Enters a Bitter!
Protest Against San Fran
cisco Normal School Bill;
Sr*eia! Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19.âAt last
the Senate is getting down to serious
we rk. For the first time since the ses
sion opened the upper house of the
Legislature held two sessions to-day,
both of which were enlivened by
rhetorical flights and exchanges of
sarcastic- thrusts.
The morning: session was marked by
another battle against the junket reso
lution introduced yesterday by Pen
dleton providing that the committees
on Finance, Education. Hospitals and
Reformatories and Buildings and
Grounds be authorized to appoint a
sub-committee, to be composed of two
members of each committee, to inves
tigate the various institutions of the
Str.te, and. though the resolution was
finally adopted by a narrow majority,
it went in with a rider that provides
that when this sub-committee is about
to depart on its journey it must be
first authorized by a two-thirds vote.
Judging by the vote of to-day the
junketers will fail to rally the neces
sary strength and unless recognized
necessity for a junket arises it looks
now as though the hopes of the pro
ponents of the resolution are blasted
f c rever.
The resolution was introduced and
sent to the Finance Committee yester
day without disturbance, owing to the
absence of known opponents to such
schemes, but this morning found Sena
tor Shortridge at his desk, his rhetoric
tugging at the leash and ready for
combat.
SHORTRIDOF IS SARCASTIC. '
"I am astonished," said Shortridge,
"that the Finance Committee, of
which my colleague, Belshaw, is chair
man, has reported favorably on this
resolution. I want it understood that
I am opposed without chance of com
promise to this resolution. However,
I am weary of all the bickering and I
pledge you that if you ever hear my
voice again in the Senate it will be in
favor of or against a matter of much
more importance than the cheap
scheme which some of these wise Sen
ators are trying to foist upon us. I
do not stand here as a reformer. Oh,
no! I hate the very name. I will be
with you when you start to loot the
treasuryâwhen its looting means some
thing for the State, the comfort of the
insane, the pleasure of the blind or
hope to its prisoners." I
"How prone all are to jump at con
clusions," said Senator Belshaw in an
swer to Shortrldge's thrusts. "The
Senator from Contra Costa and Marin
hasn't changed his opinion one whit in
regard to this and similar schemes.
This resolution was discussed in com
mittee, a majority declared in favor
of it and there was nothing left for
me to do under the rules but to so re- |
pert to the Senate. However, I am
personally against the resolution and I
will vote against it on the floor as is
m: right, the report of the committee
of which I am chairman notwithatand- i
insr."
DISCUSSION WAXES WARM. j
Ralston, seeing that things were
waxing warm, entered the contest with '
a substitute resolution, providing that
in event it should be shown that inves
tigations were necessary that each Sen
ate committee should have the right to !
appoint a sub-committee of two to in- 1
vestigate any institution coming under |
its Jurisdiction. Emmons pointed out 1
that the substitute was worse than the
original, as it would authorise the ap- j
pointment of seventy-two men to com- j
i mittees when there were but forty Sen- i
j ators. Markey then sought to force a
j vote on the previous question, but he
, failed and Ralston was permitted to
i amend his substitute resolution where- j
Iby the committees on Education, Yl- ;
j nance, Hospitals and Asylums, i
i Prisons and Reformatories and j
j Public Buildings and Grounds would j
alone be authorized to appoint sub- i
committees to carry on investigations, !
j the sub-committees to* consist of three j
i members each.
j Emmons again objected, saying he
I didn't see why Senator Ralston wanted j
Jto increase the sub-committees ffom \
I two members, as provided in the origi- I
! nal resolution, to three members. Ral- I
j ston explained that he did so at the re- j
quest of the. committees contained in J
| his amended substitute resolution, j
' Then Bauer again entered the contro- |
i versy, asking that the Committee on I
! Commissions and Retrenchments be I
j added to the list. The confusion was |
then complete. A call for the vote on j
i Ralston's substitute resulted in its de- j
feat in short order, and then Pendle
ton's original resolution was put to a
vote.
Twenty-four voted in its favor and
i fifteen against it and it wa.s declared
defeated by the chair. Simpson of Ala
meda raised the point of order, how
ever, that as the resolution called for
no appropriation until the committees
were authorized to start on their Junket
' a majority only was necessary to carry
it. The chair decided that the point
was well taken and' declared the resolu
{tlon passed, saying, however, that when
the committees called for extjenses to
start on their Journeys it wou% take a
two-thirds vote to legalise the war
rants on the treasury. This declara
tion of the chair again took the smiles
from the faces of those that are hun
gering to travel, for they again see de
feat ahead.
The Senate next took up the report of
- THE EMPORIUM.

I the Committee on Hospitals and Asy
lums, to which had been sent Emmons*
resolution calling: for the appointment
'of a special committee to investigate
! the conditions prevailing at Napa Hos
j pital for. the Insane.
Yesterday morning Dr. Elmer E.
; Stone, medical director of the asylum,
arrived in Sacramento to present his
side of the case. He appeared before
the committee and soon convinced the
| members that there was no occasion
; for a special investigation.
I After his statement the committee
; decided to recommend that Senator
j Emmons' resolution he amended, au
j thorizing the Committee on .Hospitals
! and Asylums to investigate the condi
j tions prevailing at the institution. The
j committee will leave here some Satur
j day night during the session and re
i turn the following Monday. If this
i committee finds that the conditions are
I not as represented it will then recom-
I mend that Senator Emmons* resolution
Jbe adopted and that a special commit
! tee take a week to get to the bottom of
! affairs.
I This recommendation met with the
i approval of the Senate this morning,
i and the plan provided for in the com
| mittee's amended resolution was
{ adopted. The Senate also received this
j morning the report of the Committee
on Prisons and Reformatories, which
recommends that the following bills do
pass:
By RalstonâAppropriating $4170 47 to
pay the deficiency in the appropriation
of the support fund occasioned by the
burning of the trades building at the
Preston School of Industry; appro
priating $600 to purchase books for the
Preston School Library; appropriating
$10,000 to build an assembly hall at the
Preston School; appropriating $2500 for
constructing a refrigerating plant at
the Preston School; appropriating $3000
to improve the f water plant at the
Preston School; appropriating $26,000
for the rebuilding and the refitting of
the Preston School trades building; ap
propriating $2600 for the purchase of
bedding and furniture and for repairs
at the Preston School.
The general file was taken up at the
afternoon session. The first bill called,
that presented -by Wolfe calling for an
appropriation of $150,000 for the pur
chase of a site and the construction of
a building for .the Normal School of
San Francisco, precipitated a warm de
bate.
"Shortridge created surprise by en
tering a bitter protest against the bill.
He said there was no, excuse for the
'iXisttnce- of the San Francisco Normal
School and that In future it would have
less excuse than in the past, because
he intended to introduce a bill estab
lishing a training school at the Uni
versity of California. If this measure
carried, he said, he* would then move
for the abolition of the San Francisco
institution.
But Senators Ward, Selvage, Keane,
Rowell artd Wolfe hammered Short
ridge's argument Into a pulp. Wolfe
said that if Shortridge did carry out
his threat to move for the abolition of
the San Francis- 1 ) State Normal School
he had better label the bill "an act
lor the abolition of Charley Shortridg*
from the politics of California."
Laughter greeted this remark, and
Shortridge was plainly discomfited.
When the bill was put to a vote it car
ried unanimously, a roar of laughter
â *nd shouts of approval greeting Short -
ridgo's change of front, brought about
by the avalanche of votes against him.
After disposing of the Normal School
bill the Senate passed Muenter's -bill
amending section 3467 of the Political
Code so as to extend the legal life of
warrants of reclamation districts. The
Senate also passed Pendleton's bill ap
propriating $4150 to pay the claim of
the Citizens' National Bank of Los
Angeles on an assignment of architects'
fees owing by the State on a contract
for work done at the Whlttler Reform
School.
Senator Keane introduced an inter
esting bHI, which provides for the pay
ment of the wages on holidays of all
State and municipal employes who are
employed by the day, thus extending
to them the same advantage as that
enjoyed by salaried officials. To-mor
row Keane will present a bill requir
ing that all electric streetcars be
equipped with air brakes, the measure
being Intended to insure the easier con
trol of cars from the standpoint of
safety and to lessen the labor of mctor
men.
The Senate Committee on Federal
Relations, to which had been referred
the Yosemite and Mariposa Big; Tree
grove recession bill, reported this
morning. Senator Irish, chairman, and
Savage reported that the bill be adopt
ed. Sanford, the third member of
the committee, filed a minority report
against the bill. The bill was made a
rpecial order for next Tuesday morn
ing.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
Proposed Constitutional Amendment
Is Introduced in Senate.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19.â-Again
the Legislature has to deal with the
question of woman suffrage. A pro
posed constitutional amendment was
introduced In the Senate this morning
by Senator Ralston, which, if passed
by both houses, will enable the elect
ors of the State at the next general
election to determine whether or not
the women of California shall be
vested with the right to vote.
The proposed amendment simply
strikes out of section 1, article 11, of
the State constitution the word
"male," substituting therefor the word
"native," the provision then reading:
"Every native citizen of the United
States, etc., shall be entitled to vote,
etc."
Mrs. Austin S. Perry, president of
the California Woman Suffrage As
sociation, Mrs. M. V*. Osborne of Los
Angeles and Miss Mary Fairbrother.

the amendment. r

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
SOPHOMORES SPURN COIN
AND DEMAND MEDALS.
Anfjru Authors of Football Farce Want Promise Kept
Reject Manager's Munificent Offer of $10 Cash, and Class
Is Split Into Factions Over the Burning Issue.
BERKELEY, Jan. 19.â"Take back
your gold" is in essence the reply three
prominent members of the sophomore
class of the university have made to
Nathaniel Eddy, also a sophomore, who
managed the football show produced
by the class last term.
â¢The three men who rejected Eddy's
proffer of gold are Hans Llsser. Henry
Finch and Harry Rogers. They were
the authors of the football play and
they scorn pay for their services, de
manding instead that Manager Eddy
shall supply them with medals. These,
they say, were promised the writers
of the class farce.
The class is divided Inifi factions on
the subject, and the issue has become
a burning one.
;The football show is annually given
by the sophomore class of the univer
sity on the night of the day when
Berkeley engages in its annual foot
ball game with Stanford. Last term
the competition among candidates for
the honor of writing the football show
piece was keen. The winners expected
to be rewarded with handsome medals
that 6hould commemorate their vic
tory and their work.
Rogers, Lisser and Finch wrote an
ambitious piece, called "The Men from
Stanford." It was a musical farce,
and so pretentious that the cast hard
ly did its lines and music justice. Hence
the show was not rated as a brilliant
success, though its merits were un
questioned.
The authors have waited patiently
for their medals, only to be informed
by Manager "Nat" Eddy, they say, that
instead of getting the medals they
may divide up $10 as compensation for
their work.
The coin has been refused, the medals
have been demanded, the partisans
have taken sides and the class is now
embroiled in a hot squabble as the
aftermath of the famous football show.

WONG'S WIFE
ASKS LETTERS
Widow of Bookmaker "Re

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 19.
Margaret B. Young, wife of Caesar
"ioung, the bookmaker, for whose mur
der Nan Randolph, a chorus girl, is
now confined in a New York jail, ap
plied for letters of administration to
day on her husband's estate in Ala

The estate consists of a home in Clare
mont and some horses, remains of a
good stable, and of which Eonic won
the Burns handicap two years ago at
the generous odds of twenty to one.
What Young's estate is really worth
is not known here. His home has a
market value, but the rest of his prop
erty cannot be estimated. He was
considered worth at least $100,000 when
operating his book at the local race
track. How much of that was ready
cash and was lost in the reverses he
is said to have sustained just before his
death cannot be told. In her petition
Mrs. Young states that her husband
has four brothers and four sisters in
England.
NOTED ITALIAN
WILL SING FOR
HUGHES CLUB
BY ZOE GREEN RADGLTFFB.
OAKLAND, Jan, 19.âT0-morrow evening
the Hughes Club will once more, after the
lapse of a year, give one of the concerts which
have been numbered among the important
musical events of the past. This club, which
is composed entirely of women and which is
named for Its director, D. P. Hughes, has been
forced Into a retirement that came near dis
rupting the. organization, for lack of a suit
able concert hall. Their concerts were form
erly given in the Unitarian church and in
variably filled, to the point of discomfort,
that spacious edifice. But the trustees are no
longer permitted to rent the church and the-
Hughes Club, along with other would-be en
tertainers, has been obliged to retire, tem
porarily, from public life.
Recently, however, Hamilton Hall, on
Thirteenth street, has been renovated and to
morrow evening the friends of this popular
club will enjoy what promises to be a fine
programme.
The star of the evening, of course, will be
the Italian barytone, Enearnacao, who. came
to this coast with the grand opera company
now singing at the Tivoli and who Is enjoy
ing a well-earned rest in California. Signor
Kncarnacao is very well acquainted with
Llewellyn Hughes and it was on account of
his friendship for the talented Oakland boy
that he consented to sing at the concert to
morrow evening. The great singer is a favor
ite wtth Portugal's King and wears with
pride a handsome fob chain given him by that
monarch.
The choral numbers for to-morrow evening
are said to be unusually good, and as a Hughes
Club concert is always a brilliant social as
well as musical event Hamilton Hall will
likely be crowded.
The Hughes Club's predicament In having
no tjttncert hall adequate to its demands is
one more emphatic plea for an auditorium in
Oakland and every day the need grows more
urgent.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It is not generally known that Llewellyn
Hughes was married about a year ago and
now come the glad tidings that he Is the
proud father of a little daughter. This is
Mr. and Mrs. D. P. Hughes' only grandchild
api they are very happy over the news.
Llewellyn Hughes Is now leader of an or
chestra for an opera company, having met
with really wonderful success in Europe.

DRIFT ON BAY
DURING NIGHT
Three Boys Take a Boat and
Set Out on, a Voyage That
Ends in Alameda City Jail
ALAMEDA, Jan. 19.âAfter taking a
small boat that did not belong to them
and stocking the little craft with pro
visions, three lads, Samuel Harvey,
Louis Unthank-and Douglas Wood, act
out to explore the Bay of San Fran
Cisco. They were driven over to Hun
ters Point in a stiff, cold blow durinr;
the night, and It was only by constant
bailing on the return trip that the
youthful sailors kept the frail vessel
afloat and beached her at the West
End. They were exhausted when they
reached the shore. To-day the lads
were taken into custody by Detective
George Brown on complaint of J. S.
Holmstrand, the owner of the boat,
who charges the youths with petty lar
ceny. He says they made use of his
craft without his permission, and that
in beaching the boat they stove in one
side.
City Justice R. B. Tappan, before
whom the accused boys appeared, lec
tured them severely, and said that he
would be guided in the disposition of
their cases by the District Attorney's
office. It is probable that the young
defendants, none of whom is over six
teen years of age, will be remanded to
the Juvenile Court.

Pursued by remorse, discouraged and
disheartened, Hyraan B. Rose surren
dered himself into custody at the City
Prison this morning as a fugitive from
Memphis, Term., with two charges of
forgery hanging over his head. Weary
of eluding the police for two years.
Rose said he had given up because the
strain had become too great. Rather
than continue his wanderings he was
willing to take a chance in the hands
of the law.
Rose's efforts to break into prison
failed, but he had the satisfaction of
learning that he was no longer in fear
of arrest. Chief Hodgklns wired the
Memphis police and received the reply
from the Tennessee authorities that
Rose's accusers refused to prosecute
him and would not send for the fugi

Rose told the police that he had
forged checks for $150 and $100, respec
tively on the Memphis Cider and Vine

of Tonopah are anxious to have the
county seat of Nye County changed
from Belmont to the great mining
camp, and a bill providing for its re

fight against it in the Legislature.
Those opposed to the bill claim that
Tonopah is hot permanent and that
the county seat should not be moved
from its present location until the
mining camp is proven to be a city
that will last and not only a camp to
be deserted when a few mines are
worked out.

Mixed in the Wires, Cause a
Short Circuit,
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19.âTwo wild
cats threw every town and hundreds
of homes in the San Bernardino Valley
into total darkness for two hours Tues
day night. Between Ontario and Azu
sa the romping beasts sped up a pole

mixed among the lines, and caused a
short circuit of 15,000 vdltage. It took
a long time to locate the trouble and
turn the current on the reserve wires.
The incinerated bodies of the cats
were found i to-day among the cross
arms on the pole, where electrocution
had ended their frolic. Among the
dozen towns which suffered were San

Primaries and Convention
NUMBER OF DELEGATES
Basis of Apportionment Sub
ject of Discussion by
Prominent Men in Party
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
> 2148 Center Street, Jan. 19.
Republicans of the university town
met last night In Shattuck Hall to dis
cuss matters relating; to the coming
primary election and city convention,
the call for such discussion having been
Issued by the Republican City Central
Committee. Most of the members of
the latter body were present, Chairman
Thomas presiding at the meeting.
Before the committee adjourned Its
hearty support was pledged to the
School Board, a plan to bond the city
for $150,000, the money thus obtained to
be used for constructing new school,
buildings.
Speeches were made by prominent
members of the party, at Chairman
'Thomas* invitation, upon the subject of
apportioning delegates to the various
wards of the town and the method of
the appointment of such delegates.
E. C. Marliave suggested that the
fairest method would be to apportion
the delegates on the basis of the vote
cast at the last municipal election,
using particularly the vote cast for
Judge Lord.
Committeeman A. B. Shaw believed a
better basis would be the vote cast at
the last election for Congressman Jo
seph R. Knowland.
It was argued that the municipal
election vote would not be a fit basis
because it brought out strength in cer
tain wards that were particularly in
terested at that time, while other wards
had no special interests at stake then
and so cast a comparatively light vote.
The discussion was participated in by
Town Trustee Staats, Dr. C. P. F.
Biehl, Major Jensen, Harry Johnson,
Auditor Hanscom and Chairman
Thomas, but action was deferred until
a second meeting of the committee next
Wednesday night.

JR. TO RECOVER $28,000 DAMAGES , FOR INJURIES RECEIVED BY THE
OVERTURNING OF AN AUTOMOBILE WHILE THEY WERE RIDING.
ââ
". Alice O'Day, the young woman who
â¢was painfully injured in an automobile
accident on April 1. 1904, brought suit
"vsterday for $25,000 damages against
George Whittell Jr., whose guest she
.was at the time of the accident. Miss
'O'Day says that at the time Whittell
was acting as his own chauffeur and
became reckless in his management of
the auto.
â . In the vehicle besides Miss O'Day
'were Miss Lois Henry, "Billy" Otts, the
boxer, and a professional chauffeur.
â¢The. party left Oakland bound for Hay
â wards and the accident occurred about
c o'clock in the evening. While on the
â¢Hag Leandro road, opposite Hawley
.avenue, near the Moss tract, a buggy
Fuddenly loomed in front of the swiftly
moving machine. Before Whittell had
a ( hance to avert a collision the crash
/â¢ame. Whittell, however, gave a turn
to .the wheel lever as the vehicles col
lided and over went the automobile.
Miss Henry, Otts and the chauffeur
â¢ wcFe thrown out, while Whittell and
Miss O'Day were caught under the
, overturned machine. The Misses Neil},
'two] elderiy women who were In
the buggy were hurled into the road,
. one,sustaining a fracture of the collar
bone and a dislocation of the shoulder,
..the other receiving internal injuries.
"Miss O'Day was taken out senseless,
â¢ with her head and body badly gashed
.and. bruised. Upon regaining con
sciousness she complained of internal
injuries. In her complaint she alleges
â¢that some bones were broken; that she
was in bed thirteen weeks, and that
' she has become a cripple for life.
The occupants of the buggy were
treated at San Leandro, while the
members of Whittell's party were
driven to Fruttvale, where their inju
ries were attended. Later the party
came to the city and Miss O'Day went
under the care of Dr. S. G. Boyd. In
â¢ August of last year Dr. Victor G. Vecki
â¢brought suit against Whittell's father
..â¢and Dr. Boyd for $3000 for services ren
dered to Miss O'Day. Dr. Vecki al
leged that he had been employed by
â¢ Dr. Boyd, acting as the elder Whit
' toll's agent, to perform an operation
upon the young woman. This action is
still in litigation.

COUSIN ENTERS
SMITH CONTEST
Peterson's Claims Met With
Evidence of Hostility of
the Bead Parents of Heirs
SUPPORT GRANDMOTHER
Prominent Persons Called to
Refute Charge That She
Is Unfit to Be a Guardian
A third element In the three-cornered
contest for the guardianship of the But
ler Smith children and their fortunes
appeared in Judge Kerrigan's court
yesterday and developed more revela
tions. General W. H H. Hart intro
duced his client, Robert Peterson,
cousin of the deceased mother of the
children, who claims recognition as an
outsider who can care for the interests
of the boy and the girl impartially in
case any litigation arises in which the
grandmother or the stepmother would
be opposed to them.
Peterson said he had been a law clerk
in New "Pork and a cook, painter and
coffee seller in California, He now lives
with his family on Second avenue. Wit
nesses, including his wife and daughter,
were offered to prove his fitness to care
for the Smith children, and then a bomb
was thrown into his camp by the
widow's attorney, Burrell G. White,
who called J. D. Whaley to the stand.
Whaley was Butler Smith's attorney
and knew Robert Wilson, father of
Smith's second wife. He said that Wil
son had bestowed $55,000 in money and
land upon his two nephews, of whom
Peterson was one. Whaley, on behalf
of the then Mrs. Smith, had reproved |
the old man for this, and when Wilson
said that he would give when and to
whom he saw fit Whaley applied for .
and obtained letters of guardianship
over him. Whaley declared that Mrs.
Smith, in discussing a demand of Peter
son for a deed to some of the property
given him, had said that she wanted
nothing to do with him âthat he and
his brother had robbed her enough.
Peterson was recalled and admitted
that he and his brother had each re
ceived $15,000 from Wilson, but no more. â 
Mrs. Chamberlain, the grandmother, !
j also had an inning. Witnesses who had
I long known to her were called to testify :
jto her fitness to guard the children,
i They included the Rev. John A. Emery,
! Archdeacon of the Protestant Episcopal
I diocese of California; Appraiser John
IT. Dare, Attorney Charles H. Hudson,
j Dr. Howard Herrlngton, Dr. John T. '<
j Vanderlip, Mrs. C. K. Yale and Mrs. :
j Mary E. Howland. Mrs. Howland said
i she was Mrs. Chamberlain's most inti
| mate friend, but admitted that she had
| heard Mrs. Smith say that she wished
I her daughter and the grandmother
I could get along better together,
j Emily May Smith, the ijwidow, was j
! recalled and told of a conversation j
' with her husband a few days after their
| marriage. He had made a will, he said, j
; naming the grandmother guardian, had
I revoked it and named Hal V. Smith
! instead, and then thought neither
would do, intending to appoint Garret
W. McEnerney. The need of a guardian
was settled, he said, when he met her.
The will, made before the marriage,
is necessarily void and Judge Kerrigan
yesterday appointed Mrs. Smith ad- J
j ministratrix of her husband's estate, j
I fixing her bonds at $90,000. She also J
! has special letters of administration i
| upon the former wife's estate, for i
I which Mrs. Chamberlain has applied
for general letters. The hearing will
go on to-day.
MINER LOSES
HIS LAWSUIT
Mono County Lawyer Offers
Temperance Vow to Show
Defendant Employed Him
Â»
When United States Circuit Judge
Morrow yesterday gave judgment for
the defendant in the case of Richard
S. Miner vs. T. B. Rickey and the
Rickey Land and Cattle Company, he
closed a trial that had several interest
ing features.
Miner is an attorney at law living at
Bridgeport, Mono County. He sued the
defendants in the Superior Court of
that county to recover $3143 as fees for
services in a suit brought by Miller &
Lux against the defendants in Nevada.
Miner's suit was subsequently trans
ferred to tbe United States Circuit
Court in this city.
Rickey denied that he had retained
Miner, and said that Trenmor Coffin
was his attorney in the suit mentioned.
He admitted that he had unsuccess
fully endeavored ta induce his co-de
fendant, the Rickey Land and Cattle
Company, to employ Miner.
Miner Introduced the following docu
ment as an exhibit in the case:
CAKSON, Nevada. July 31, 1902.
During my connection with the caae of Mil
ler 4 Lux vs. T. B. Rickey et al., as attorney
at law, I promts* and agree with said T. B.
Rickey not to drink any Intoxicating liquor
without thÂ«> consent of said T. B. Rickey, and
should I violate this agreement I further agree
to pay said T. B. Rickey the sum of one
thousand dollars in gold coin of the United
SUtes of America. RICHARD S. MINER.
Witnessed by Trenmor Coffin
Miner explained that while traveling
on the isthmus he contracted Panama
fever, and his physician prescribed
whisky as a steady medicine to drive
out the disease. Miner followed the
doctor's advice for twelve years. At
the end of that period he signed the
agreement Just quoted, and since then
had never tasted alcohol.
Judge Morrow decided that Miner
had failed to prove that he had been
employed defendants, and gave
Judgment accordingly.

MRS. BELL LOSES SUIT
TO BREAK FATHER'S WILL
New York Supreme Court Decides
Against Daughter of the Late
Henri Vlllard.
NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â8y a deci
sion handed down at White Plains to
day Supreme Court Justice K-eogh has
sustained the demurrer of the defend
ants In the suit brought by Mrs. James
W. Bell to v -et the will of her father,
the late Henry Vlllard.
The defendants contended that Mrs.
Bell, by consenting in writing to the
probate of the will, accepting the leg
acy and incoipa given to her under It,
and by failure to bring the suit within
the statutory period of two years, had
forfeited the right to attack the will.
These contentions were sustained by
Justice Keough.
GIVE CROSSES
TO VETERANS OF
CONFEDERACY
A delightfully Interesting convention
was that held yesterday at the home of
Mrs. Alfred Hunter Voorhies, when the
Albert Sidney Johnston Chapter, United
Daugnters of the Confederacy, met to
bestow crosses of honor. January 19 is
one of the two gala days in the exist
ence of this society. To-day com
memorates the birthday of well-loved
Robert E. Lee and a day that is ob
served throughout the United States by
every Confederate chapter. June 3 is
the other, in memory of Jefferson Da
vis. Yesterday an address was given
by Mrs. Pritchard. daughter of
Albert Sidney Johnston, an ad
dress that claimed attention and
affection, for the old Southern
spirit never dies. Among those re
ceiving the cross of honor was Thomas
G. Parker, and from the hand of Mrs.
Voorhies. who had met him in 1864 in
Griffin, Ga., where he lay in hospital
after a heated battle. The personal re
flections upon this one presentation
were many and interesting. Other re
cipients of the coveted cross were:
Henry C. Brown,jw. E. Franklin, J.
M. Mullin, William Randolph Old, L.
H. Thomasson, George W. Gretter,
James C. Tucker, Lewis Booker, George
D. White, E. Curtis, Dr. Dozier.

COAST SEEKING
REPRESENTATION
An Increase of Membership
for Interstate Body Is
Advocated in Resolution
The Manufacturers' and Produpers'
Association of California adopted reso
lutions yesterday favoring the increase
of members in the Interstate Commerce
Commission from five to seven, and
giving representation to the Pacific
Coast and to the Northwest on the
commission, each to have one member.
This action was prompted by the opin
ion of business men and manufacturers
on this coast that, considering the lack
of knowledge on the part of Eastern
people regarding the peculiar conditions
that exist on the Pacific slope and also
the fact that the commission as now
constituted represents only the coun
try east of the Missouri River, there Is
danger that the ruling that was won
in the fight with the St. Louis jobbers
in behalf of Pacific Coast interests may
be overturned on a possible subsequent
hearing. Should this take place great
damage would be caused to the busi
ness of this coast.
The manufacturers and producers
also resolved, in view of the fact that
the Pacific Coast Is not represented on
the Interstate Commerce Commission,
that it would not be beneficial to /the
commercial interests of the coast to
give the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion additional power to make arbi-
clared that the present interstate com
merce law is a proper one if measures
are taken to expedite the hearing* of
cases on appeal which involves the es
tablishment of a court of transporta
tion, the decisions of which should be
final except In cases where the consti
tutionality of the decrees was ques
tioned.
A resolution was adopted favoring*
the recession of the Yosemite and the
Mariposa Big Tree Grove to the United
States.
MAYOR SCHMITZ HANDS
METSON HIS COMMISSION
Member Newly Appointed to Vacancy
on the Park Board Takes
His Oath of Office.
Mayor Schmltz yesterday handed
William H. Metson his commission as
a member of the Park Commission.
Metson took his official oath and will
be formally inducted to his office at
next Friday's meeting of the Commis
sion. Metson is a Democrat in poli
tics. He is well fitted by experience
to assist in the management of the
parks, having been a member of the
Park Board previous to 1900, when
the charter went into effect.
It is said that William J. Dingee will
In all likelihood be elected president
of the Park Board in the event that
President Adolph Spreckels is not
honored with a second term.

PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
FRIDAY JANUARY 20, 1905
A NORMAL SCHOOL BUILDING.
Iâii âi CONOMY sometimes causes waste. The economy that denies
M a proper building and equipment for the State Normal School
in this city is of the wasteful kind. The salaries of teachers
are not so sumptuous that they can afford any extra expense in
preparing for their profession." For this reason Normal schools are
so distributed over the State that a great majority of those who
attend them can economize by living at home while taking the
course.
The location of the San Francisco Normal School permits over
.one-fourth of the students in the State who are qualified for Normal
training to enjoy its advantages while living at home. The Normal
schools at Los Angeles, San Jose and Chico are housed in proper
buildings, properly equipped, while the State has never furnished any
.shelter at all for the San Francisco school, and has made no appropri
ation for a site or building. These are facts not generally known,
and they should be widely published to inform the people as to the
State's duty to this school.
In order to permit the school to start, the School Department
of this city let it occupy two old and disused schoolhouses, one of
â¢which has been in service forty years and the other thirty. In these
buildings forty-one rooms were fenced off for the accommodation
of 500 students and the pupils of the training schools. The location
and. nature of the accommodations furnished by these old buildings
may be judged by the fact that the city School Board now needs
.one of them for the Chinese school, and it must be vacated by the
first of next July!
Twice the Legislature has passed appropriations for a site and
building for this Normal school. Each time the bill passed at the
close of the session and died in the Governor's hands, after the ad
journment. The eight bay counties to which this school is econom
ically accessible contain 51 per cent of the taxable property of the
.State. The State has spent .over $1,000,000 in equipping the other
Normal schools of the State, of which these counties have paid 51
per cent, while for the shelter of their school they are compelled to
rely upon the charity of the San Francisco School Department, which
mus* now be partly withdrawn because one of the buildings is
nftcred for the Chinese!
The necessity for trained teachers in our public schools is great.
Teaching is no longer a catch-as-catch-can matter. Formerly a
fairly educated person was supposed to be able to teach. But edu
! cation is not all of it. There must be not only knowledge, but the
faculty of imparting it to others, and of rousing in the young a taste
for learning and the ambition to acquire it. In the Normal school
this faculty is discovered or the lack of it demonstrated. It is a
faculty that must be present by nature in the individual, jyst as
aptness for the profession of law or of medicine must be present to
make a successful career in either. When a school is put under a
teacher, no matter how learned, who has not this faculty the money
that maintains it is wasted, and the pupils are injured rather than
benefited.
In this proper view of it the importance of the work of the
Normal school cannot be overestimated. The highest duty the
State owes to its people is providing properly equipped teachers for
their public schools. The whole character of the citizenship of each
.'generation depends upon the work done in these schools. Its qual
ity is absolutely dependent upon the equipment of teachers in the
Normal schools. For this equipment of teachers there must be
proper provisions, and these are not secured in a building that 11
only up to the standard required for a Chinese school. With all of
its disadvantages this school last year received 28 per cent of all
the high school graduates of the State qualified for normal training.
Yet it is sheltered in buildings that have been condemned by the
Board of Health as unfit for occupancy, even by the Chinese school
unless extensively rectified. It has been the means of raising the
percentage of trained teachers in the bay counties from only 13 to 21
per cent.
In view of all this good work accomplished under absolutely
squalid conditions, a citizen of California should blush in the dark
when he thinks of the State's neglect of its duty. The attendance
of students has been double the capacity of its squalid quarters, and
those who have sought its instruction under such circumstances have
paid a high compliment to its teachers, and themselves deserve praise
for such devotion to their ideals of their chosen profession as moves
them to its preparation under such conditions.
The provision of proper quarters can be deferred no longer. The
necessity of surrendering one of the ancient ruins in which part of
the school is sheltered brings its needs before the Legislature in
acute form. This should be naturally the model Normal school of
the State. It should be so fully equipped that alumni of the other

metropolis.
We have many thousands of Eastern visitors here every year
who are close inquisitors into the public institutions of San Fran
cisco and the expression of our civilization through our schools.
These visitors are kept away from the Normal school. During one
of the great conventions held here last.year a party of visitors in a
drive about town passed one of the buildings occupied by the Nor
mal school and the local escort was asked what it was. With great
presence of mind he lied to save the credit of the State, by answering
that it used to be a brewery but was condemned by the Board of
Health. The Eastern visitors commenderrthe vigilance of the Board
of Health and condemned the building. Now, this should not be.
We should have a proper building, that we need not hide. The
appropriation should be passed now so that it cannot be-caught in the
ruck at the end of the session.
SENATOR STONE FOR REFORM.
IT is a sight that must interest the gods and amuse men to see
Senator Gum-shoe Stone of Missouri declaiming for public purity
and proposing to investigate the source of campaign funds as far
back as 1896. His righteous soul is in agony and travail lest some
improper dollars were dropped in the hat. He introduces a bundle
of old straw and flails it with great vigor. The elections of 1896 and
1900 were so largely one way, and that of 1904 so overwhelmingly
one way, that it is a cause of amusement to claim that money could .
have influenced such results. /
The man who will charge, as this distorted Senator does, that I
a majority of 2,500,000 of his fellow citizens were corruptly affected I
â¢at the last election should be stood in the stocks and pelted with !
deceased cats and things. He is enraged because Missouri did not j
go to suit him. He belongs to the anti-Folk wing of the
in his State. He was elected to the Senate by the baking powder!
Legislature, and when Folk took up that investigation a trail of bak
ing powder led toward Stone's quarters. Now, Folk was elected
Governor and Roosevelt earned Missouri, whereat Stone's gorge j
rises and the results spatter the Senate.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. JANUARY 20, 1905.
THE COMING
OF GRANDMA
T*ifE man strode toward her with
undisguised pleasure in his eyes.
"Helena, this is, indeed, an
unexpectedâ"
"Surprise?" broke in the girl, un
mindful of the ambiguity her interup
tion lent to his remark.
"Pleasure," corrected Norton firm
ly. He did not fail to detect an un
dertone of sarcasm In Helena's tone.
She shrugged her shoulders. "Oh,"
she said simply, but that one word
conveyed depths of Incredulity.
"'Going away?" asked Norton, look
ing about for some traveling impedi
menta. And yetâif Helena had been
going away surely he would have
known it.
The girl flung him a scornful
glance.
"No," she said, tapping her foot
nervously on the tiled floor of the
station. "And you?" looking point
edly at the bunch of violets he car
ried.
"I've come to meet a train."
Helena glanced at the big clock on
the wall. "It's six minutes yet," she
informed him knowingly. Since his
arrival her chin had been elevated
perceptibly.
Norton's glance followed hers to
the clock. "Jove! It's in nowâmy
train," he said, and with a hasty adieu
he rushed through the great doors,
leaving her staring after him dazed.
Again her eyes sought the clock.
No, she was not mistaken. Florence
had wired that she would arrive at
3:10 and it was now only 3:04. "Never
mind meeting me," she had added in
her telegram, but Helena had only
laughed away her friend's instruc
tions. Florence had always been over
thoughtful.
Now she sat down on the depot
bench. Norton must have been mis
informed as to the time of arrivalâ
heâwhy, of course, Florence had sent
him word, too. It seemed quite un
necessary to Helena and yetâshe sud
denly recalled that he had stopped off
at Poughkeepsie once or twice. She
saw it all now; Norton had only been
coming to see her, taking her out,
keeping in touch with her on account
of Florence. He wished to be wel
come at the Bradford home when the
girls visited them. 'Never mind meet
ing me" âthe words in Florence's
message rang in Helena's mind. Why
were they so secretive about it all?
The girl brushed her hand over her
eyes. Was â¢he dreaming orâoh, she
longed to be at home where she could
bury her head in her pillows and
She started. Coming toward her,
attentively guiding an elderly woman,
was Norton. He held her arm and
looked down into her wrinkled face
with a tenderness Helena had never
before seen in his eyes. Thenâhe did
not come to meet Florence? This was
j erhaps his grandmother; she was too
old for his mother.
Norton raised his hat and smiled as
he passed her, but Helena stared at
him stupidly, barely nodding her head.
A dark flush mounted to his very hair,
but as he followed her into the car
riage Helena saw him hand the old
lady the violets. The girl's brain
cleared.
How she had misjudged him. Her
heart beat wildly and she longed now
to rush after him and apologize for
the way in which she had greeted him.
But even when she saw him how
could she explain her behavior?
In her excitement and in the rush
of conflicting emotions which surged
through her Helena almost forgot the
train she was to meet. But, girl-like,
her guest was looking everywhere for
some one from the Bradford family,
in spite of her suggestion that none
of them should be there.
"I knew you'd come," she said, after
an effusive greeting.
"Of course, goosie," retorted Helena,
hugging her friend's arm enthusiast!-

cally. "Not meet you when I haven't
seen you for months?"
But all afternoon, above the chat and
gossip incident to her guest's arrival,
Helena's mind reverted to her conduct
at the station. Would Norton ever
come to see her again? And if he did
not, could she afford to write him a
note of apology?
That evening whenever the bell rang
* +

her heart did somersaults with undue
energy. And when Norton was an
nounced she could scarcely keep her
Joy within bounds. Never before to
day had she realized what a large part
he played in her life; how much she
had learned to believe him hers In
spite of the indifferent manner in which
she always treated him.
Florence was not ready to go down
stairs and her hostess, glad of the op
portunity to see Norton for a minute
alone, preceded her.
"Helena," began the man, holding
out his hand Just as he had that morn
ing in the depot, "I had to come to
night." He searched her eyes, half
looking for the scorn which he saw in
them in the station. He was visibly
relieved, if puzzled, when he discovered
her old sauclness playing in them
again.
"Why?" she asked hypocritically.
"It is for me to ask whyâafter this
morning," he said softly, and stepping
closer to her.
"Florence arrived this morning,"
Helena began irrelevantly.
The man frownedânot at the news
she had imparted, but at her persist
ency in changing the subject.
"And my grandmother, too, arrived,"
he said.
Helena nodded. "Yes. I saw you."
"I wouldn't have known It from your
glance."
"Perhaps you are imaginative orâor
over-sensitive." the girl persisted, try
ing to make the outcome easier for her
self. She felt âoh, so wickedly deceit
ful; she almost hated herself. Both
cheeks burned and she avoided his di
rect gaze.
"Look here, Helena," said Norton,
laying one hand on her-shoulder. "Why
were you soâso different this morning?
Was it because my dear old grand
mother is soâso different from the
KIT CARSON AS A
MESSENGER.
There was needed a messenger to
the Government at Washington. Who
better could serve at this than this
iron-framed little rider. Kit Carson?
B> started on September 15. 1846, and
had won across the Rocky Mountains
when he met General Kearny's
column and was ordered to return to
California. In this return the Kear
ny column was assailed by the Cali
fornia Mexicans, stern fighters them
selves, who pushed Kearny's forces
into a desperate situation. The be
leaguered troops needed a messenger
out to San Diego. Kit Carson and
Lieutenant Beale of the navy under
took the task. The hardships of the
march wrecked the mind and body of
Beale, who was an invalid for two
years thereafter. It was nothing to
Kit Carson. In March, 1847, he was
started once more as a dispatch-bearer
to Washington. This time he met the
Indians on the Gila, fought them, got
through, crossed New Mexico, descend
ed the Arkansas River and in the
,month of June arrived at Washington,
after having made 4000 miles In three
months' time. The journey requires
little more than three days now; but
we do not make it horseback.
At Washington, as some sort of re
ward for his services, Carson was ap
pointed lieutenant of the Rifle Corps
of the United States army. His com
mission, however, was never ratified,
though this he did not learn until
some months later. He was sent back
to California with dispatches. He
crossed the Missouri River, fought the
Comanches at the Point of Rocks, got
thiough them, passed the Rockies, and
had won as far through as the Virgin
River before he met his next Indian
fight. He and fifteen companions here
stood off 300 Indians. In time he
reached Monterey, and later, simply to
keep himself in practice, took service
against the Mexicans on the border for
a time. /
There was no man of all those
known to the army officers who had
the resources or was so well qualified
as a dispatch rider as Kit Carson. He
was sent back once more to Washing
ton in the spring of 1848. The physi
cal frame of arjy other man except
himself had been by these joumeyings
too far racked to enable him to make
this long and hazardous trip. The
souls of most men would have failed
them long ere this. Yet this hardy,
tiugh little man, just big enough for
steady riding, cheerfully undertook
this third Journey across a continent
a* dispatch-bearer.âEmerson Hough,
In January Outing.

women we meet here?" Helena raised
a protesting hand, but he hurried on.
"My father, as you know, was a self
made manâand his mother âbut don't
think I am ashamed of her!"
Helena's lips quivered and her eyes
burned. "Oh, believe me, it wasn't
your grandmother. I think she's lovely.
I âl thought you had come to mcct â
Florence," she cried, throwing up her
head and looking him squarely in the
eyes at last.
"Helena," the man said, and his
breath came quickry. "And you
cared? *
The girl nodded her head slowly.
A few moments later rhe raised her
eyes shyly to his.
"Don't you think we might have a
matron of honor instead of a maid?"
"She shall be my best man if you say
so."â(Copyright, 1905, by T. C. Mc-

ALL EXPLAINED.YOSEMITE PROBLEM
IN NEW LIGHT.
r:Wiffiam ft Miffs Says State Does Not

feMeral Grant Is a Gold Brick
â¢' William H. Mills, one of the original i
â¢promoters of the Yosemite National i
â¢ Park, and for many years a Yosemite'
"Valley Commissioner, throws new
.light on the proposition to re-cede the
.valley to-the Federal Government. In
'A -letter to the manager of The Call;
â¢rdr': Mills points out that the sentimen- j
â¢ tal' objection to "recession" is based
.c'h. false premises, inasmuch as the
valley was never ceded to the State of
California, The Federal Government
.â¢â¢still .retains the title to the land,
whereas the State Is merely privileged
â¢ to pay the expense of its maintenance
es a public recreation ground under
certain restriction. Mr. Mills' letter
.-follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 18, 1905.
.â¢' Manager of The Call, San Francisco,
CalâDear Sir: I see by Its editorial (
columns that The Call is desirous of
" promoting the recession, as it is called,
â¢of the Yosemite Valley to the Govern
ment of the United States. I trust you
â¢ will pardon the intrusion of two con
siderations touching this matter, which
have not yet been availed of In the dis
cussion. Please do me the justice to
. believe that these suggestions are not
based on the assumption that I might
.'titntribute anything of very great
value to the .discussion of the question;
â nor would I be understood as presum
ing to influence the course of your pa- j
.per in any particular; but I was for
'â¢nine'years a member of the commission
.to-manage the Yosemite, and was one
â¢pf the original promoters of the Na
tional Park which surrounds the val
ley. I was among the first, If not the
very first, to see that the control of
the territory lying around the valley
was necessary for the preservation of
the catchment areas in jvhich originate
the streams that feed the falls of that
natural wonder. The whole subject,
therefore, has a degree of maturity in
my mind, and the considerations I
have to offer are:
PROBLEM IS STATED.
Firstâlf the national premises, com
prising the Yosemite National Park,
.lying around the 33,000 acres which
comprise the so-called "cession to Cal
ifornia" were a unit, including all the
acreage within Its limitsâhad no seg- i
fegation ever been made of the area \
which was granted to the State of Cal
iforniaâwould any man to-day think
ft wise to segregate the valley itself
from the National Park and place it
under the administrative jurisdiction
of California, thus producing divided j
jurisdiction in the Yosemite? I think
it will be conceded that if the Yosemite
Valley were a part of the National
Park no one would deem the sugges
tion of its segregation from the park
\\ ise or tenable, and if it would not be
wise to segregate it certainly is not
wise to maintain such segregation.
Second âThe second consideration is
still more important. It is well to in
quire methodically Into the question as
to what we are re-ceding. Such inquiry
begins with the obvious question:
"What was granted by the Govern -
' ment of the United States?" The text
of the granting act may be appealed to
for answer to this question. There was
no grant of land In fee âthat is, the
title to the land was not granted.
.There was no unrestricted grant.
There was, however, a trust created In
the State of California, and the limita
tions of that trust were very narrow.
â¢In their very nature these limitations
constituted an impeachment of the
State. The grant was made "forever in
alienable," which condition was made
in the interest of the grantor and pro
tected it against the misappropriation,
maladministration and unwisdom of
the State. The restriction implied a
want of confidence on the part of the
grantor as to the uses and purposes to
which the grantee might devote the
valley. Presumptively the Govern
ment was unwilling to trust the people
of California with the ultimate destiny
of the premises granted, and guaran
. teed itself against the conversion of
â¢ the place into a hog ranch by not only
making the grant itself Inalienable, but

by limiting and restricting the lease
hold rights of the valley. The premises
ceded were not only not granted in fee,
but the trusteeship was restricted to
the preservation of the "cleft, or
gorge," as a public recreation ground
for all time; and even the lease term
was not left to the discretion of Cali
fornia, but was limited to ten yearsâ
a limit which has precluded the possi
bility of enlisting private capital In the
development of the valley, and espe
cially in the establishment of a hotel.
NOT CEDED TO STATE.
In fact, the Yosemite Valley waa not
ceded to the State of California. The
right to pay the expense of Its main
tenance as a public recreation ground
was the only thing granted, and so ap
prehensive was the Government that
evfen that trust might be abused that
a limited lease right was attached as
an irrevocable covenant.
When sentimental objection is intro
duced, on the ground that we are re
ceding Yosemite Valley to the Govern
ment, It is to be remembered that the
only thing granted was a privilege of
paying the cost of preservation and
maintenance of the valley as a public
recreation ground for the benefit of the
grantor, and not for the benefit exclu
sively of the grantee.
TRUST LIMITED.
This was granted In trust with nar
row limitations, and since this is the
only thing granted it Is the only thing
we have to re-cede or re-grant. We are
not re-ceding the valley, for we never
owned It. We are not re-ceding the
control of the valley, for that trust
was never reposed in us. We are sim
ply re-ceding to the Government of the
United States the responsibility of pay
ing the expense of its preservation.
The conditions of the grant to the
State, when properly considered, should
be offensive to State pride, hence the
trust may be relinquished without dis
honor. If the State would repeal the
act by which the State Indicated the
acceptance of this trust, its trusteeship
would close and the original status
would be restored. The fee to the
granted premises is in the Government
and not In the State of California. The
vacation of the trust would restore the
right of administration to the Govern
ment. Those who are opposing the re
cession would occupy a much more
consistent position If they were asking
the Government to grant the Yosemite
Valley to the State of California and
vest In the grantee the title to the
property. This is the only thing the
State of California could accept and
maintain its dignity as a sovereign
State.
Again bespeaking your pardon for
the Intrusion In this matter, I have the
honor to remain, yours very truly,
WILLIAM H. MILLS.

EXESS FUNDS
TO BE UTILIZED
Windfall for Board of Edu
cation Enables Improve
ment of School Facilities
APPOINTS SUBSTITUTES
Residents Desire the Primary
Classes Restored to the
James Lick Institution
The members of the Supervisors'
Finance Committee held a conference
yesterday with the Board of Education
and Auditor Baehr seeking to arrive at
some agreement relative to the excess
money estimated at $25,000 which will
be received from the first installment of
tastes for the support of the schools.
After the legal phases had been dis
cussed the Finance Committee and the
Auditor agreed to honor any demands
for urgent improvements to school
houses decided upon by the Board of
Education. This action will permit the
immediate construction of the new
four-room Bergerot schoolhouse in the
Richmond district to remedy the lack
of accommodations for pupils there
abouts. Director Boyle was delegated
to go ahead with the work. Sanitary
improvements of the vault systems and
sewerage in some schools will also be
made.
The Board of Education will begin
at once the construction of two addi
tional rooms in the Pacific Heights
School where eighty pupils are on the
waiting list. School Director Boyle has
been delegated to make the necessary
arrangements for the additions to cost
SISOO. The board will also paint the
Richmond and Dudley Stone schools.
A new class in the Hearst and Laguna
Honda tchools will be established, the
latter school having an excess of
eighy-three pupils. The 126,000 avail
able will do much to improve the school
facilities throughout the city, although
the sum Is far from being adequate for
the needs now urgent.
The Board of Education at Its meet
ing yesterday adopted a resolution
that the folowing, being those next in
order in the competitive examination
held June 11, 1904, be placed on the day
substitute list in the order of their
standing: Miss Lottie E. Faber, Miss
Gertrude Walker, Miss Clara Mordecai,
Miss Faustina Spadonl and Miss Cath
erine Manning. This makes fifty-seven
teachers already taken from the list of
successful contestants in the examina
tion last June.
Eighty residents near the James Lick
School "vehemently" protested against
the transfer of the primary classes
therein to the Noe Valley School, as
working a hardship on the smaller
children who formerly attended the
Lick School. The petition to restore
the primary classes to the James Lick
School was taken under advisement.
A leave of absence waa granted Miss
May McDonnell, a regular teacher in
the Denmah Grammar School, from
January 16, 1905, to the beginning of
the fall term of 1906, on account of ill
neat.
The resignation of Miss Haael Berts,
a regular teacher in the Irving M. Scott
Grammar School, was accepted, to take
effect January 16, 1906.
Town Talk.
In this week's Town Talk there are
several paragraphs dealing with amusing
episodes In local society. The Saunterer
tells of the bad manners of people Invit
ed to Mrs. Crocker's tea, of the troubles
of the society amateurs who are going to
present "The Liars," of the obstacles to
exclusiveness to be encountered by Mrs.
White, the new dictator, and of the re
sult of too much wine drinking at a
fashionable tea. Slippery statesmen at
Sacramento are also discussed. Demo
critus has a heart-to-heart talk with Abe
Ruef; Theodore Bonnet pokes fun at the
people who object to pugilism; that bril
liant essayist, Harry Cowell, discusses
"Bohemia, the Beautiful," and Robert
Mace sketches the truly remarkable ca
reer of Senator Mitchell. The big musi
cal sensation of the week at the Tivoli
inspired many interesting paragraphs in
this week's paper and the art of the
great song-birds is analyzed in a breezy
vein.
Nurses Hold House-Warming.
The nurses of the City and County
Hospital held a reception and house
warming Wednesday night in the new
quarters lately opened for their use. A
feature of the evening was the pre
sentation of a handsome gold watch
to Warden Martin W. Fleming by the
nurses and doctors of the hoepital.
The committee in charge of the re
ception comprised: Mra Ida Hamil
ton, Miss Ella Qeary. Miss Dorothy
Burns. Mlas Ivy Maooree and Miss

Aigeltinger Introduces Res
olutions Criticizing the
City's Contracting Firm
SUPERVISORS MAY ACT
Board of Public Works De
cides That Company Has
Defaulted Its Agreement
The Board of Public Works took a
fling at the contracting firm of Francis
M. Yorke"& Co. yesterday afternoon.
The Doard complained that the firm
had taken no action in repairing the
streets since December 10 and that
the bondsmen of the company had re
fused to act. After a long discussion
It was decided to pass the matter up
to the Board of Supervisors, request
ing that body to take proper steps to
see that the contract of the firm shouia
be annulled.
Resolutions fully covering the case
were drawn up by Commissioner Algel
tinger and adapted unanimously. At
torney Alexander O'Orady, acting for
the Yorke company, made objections
on various technical grounds, saying
that the company was justified in its
action In not doing work for the city
on the ground that no money had been
paid for several months and that $14,000
is still due. Following are the resolu
tions Introduced by Algeltinger:
Whereas, This board on the 7th day of
July, 1904. did. tor and In behalf of the olty
and county of San Francisco, award to F. M.
Torke & Co. a contract for the performance

half of said city and county, in the manner
and within the time provided by law, enter
into a written contract with said F. M. Torke
& Co., to perform said work in strict accord
ance with the specifications adopted by this
board and referred to in the advertisement and
notice inviting sealed proposals for the doing
of said work and which specifications were
attached to and made a part of said contract,
and at the prices named In the sealed pro
posal or bid of said F. M. Torke A Co. for
said work, now on file In the office of thlÂ»
board and which prices were Inserted In said
contract as a part thereof; and
FURTHER BLAMED.
Whereas, Said F. M. York* & Co. ever since
the 10th day of December, 1904. haa con
tinuously failed and refused to perform the
work bo contracted for. to the detriment of
the said city and county, and failed and re
fused to comply with directions given by this
board from time to time, to perform said work
In accordance with the terms, conditions and
piuvision* of said contract; and
Whereas, The sureties on the bond given
by said F. M. Torke A Co. for the faithful
performance of the said contract executed and
delivered, as required by the charter of said
city and county, or either of them, has not,
upon the said failure and refusal of said F.
M. Torke A Co., performed nor caused to be
performed said work required to be performed
by said contract; and
Whereas. The public interest, safety and
convenience require that many of the ac
cepted public streets of said city and county
heretofore paved with bituminous rock be im
mediately placed in proper repair; now, there
fore, be It
Resolved, That this board doe* hereby de
clare that said F. M. Torke â¢* Co. haa de

for the repair with bituminous rock of bitum
inous rock pavements in said olty aad county
of San Francisco, continuously from and ever
since the 10th day of December, 1004, and haa
failed and refused to perform the said work
in said contract provided for since and during
said time; and be It further
ASKS FOR HELP.
Resolved, That this board does hereby di
rect the attention of the Board of Supervisors
of said city and county to the said declara
tion of default and recommends to said board
that It take such proceedings as may be
proper and legal toward the formal annulment
of the said contract and the certificate of the
Auditor indorsed thereon provided for.in seo
tlon 10, chapter I. article HI of the charter,
and the forfeiture of the said bond; and be It
further
Resolved. That this board does hereby re
quest the said Board of Supervisors to author
ise it to cause proper and needed repairs to
!â¢â -â¢ made on the bituminous-rock paved road
ways of the public streets of the city and
county, in accordance with the specifications
for such repairs now on file In the office of
this board after proceedings had and taken

cle VI. and section 80, chapter 11, article VI
of the' charter of said city and county; and
to make available the funds necessary for
such purpose, 0J to authorize this board to
procure by purchase or rental the necessary
Implements and machines and purchase neces
sary material to enable it to cause such re
pair* to be made by the Department of Publlo
Works and thereby have the same done more
expeditiously, satisfactorily and economically
than could be accomplished otherwise, and
likewise to make available the funds neces
sary for such purpose.
The board also decided to pave H
street, from Seventh avenue west,
with bitumen instead of asphalt, as
the original contract called for.

â¢ Salable, the second choice, and with
. out working overtime at the close, de
feated Bob Ragon by less than a j
length. Big Beach, a touted one, scored
a failure.
Favorites gathered but two purses.
Langford James and Mabel Bates were
the big surprises. The track was mud
" ay and the programme only an ordin
â  ary one.
BISY BEE SCORES CLEVERLY.
Charley Patterson's filly Busy Bee,
with Alarie in the saddle, took the
opening scramble for maiden two-year
old fillies. Outfooted the first part
of it by the favorite, Achelita, and by
Southern Lady, the daughter of First
Tenor closed strongly, beating the
latter out by more than a length. Ache
lita apparently ran out on the stretch,
turn or sh*Â» would have won.
Minder, on Batidor, captured the
five-furlong sprint next decided. The
gelding (losed a mild to 1 choice,
and, taking the lead In the stretch, won
hard ridden from The Hawaiian and
Emma Reuibold. Pure Dale showed
a flash of speed, then died away.
It begins to look as if Mogregor never
would win a purse. The California
stable's three-year-old looked like the
real thing for the five and a half fur- I
long jaunt, and received sturdy sup
port at 6 to 5. After racing San Jose
and Duet into subjection, he was chal
lenged by Michaels, astride the 10 to 1
chance Mabel Bates, and lost the ver
dict by a neck. Duet, played from 20
down to 9, ran a moderate third.
BRIERS OCTFOOTS WAR TIMES.
War Times ran right to her notch,
but proved no match for Briers in the
mile selling fixture. Dr. Rowell's mare
went into the starter's hands aja 11 to 10
favorite, and, perfectly ridden by Da
vis, downed War Times without much
effort.
The going was a trifle too thin for
Barrack, but the old campaigner man
aged to finish third at that.
Even with a pair of legs that look
like Indian war clubs, Glenarvon doped
best for the mile and a quarter run. He
was accordingly hammered down in
the betting from threes to 8 to 5 favor
itism. As is invariably the case. Lang
ford James, a passed-up one, displayed
more speed than usual, assuming the
lead early and dropping in a couple of
lengths before the favorite. Theodora
L was awarded the show over Gin
Spray. r
TRACK NOTES.
"Big Bill" Knapp will be seen in the
saddle again this afternoon, Walter
Jennings and Puerl Wilkerson having
reached an agreement.
Alarie rides a clever race for a boy
not seen in the saddle oftener.
W. Davis was there with two win
ners again.
Fred Koch, a well-known Denver
business man and turfman, was a
. visitor at the track yesterday.
Now it looks as If Davis must have
ridden an awful bad race on Mabel
Bates last Tuesday. She was bet on to
â¢ beat Mogregor and after getting off
â¢seventh accomplished the feat. Mud
Is responsible for some funny fiipfiops.
Joe Kelly, on Gin Spray, was so
busily engaged in carrying out Glen
arvon on the stretch turn that he lost
the show with Dick de Neffe's gelding.

DALVAY BEATS
STRONG FIELD
Kenilworth Is Installed
Favorite, but Finishes
in the Last Position
OXFORD WINS CLEVERLY
Leads Out High Chancellor
and Princess Tulane in
a Most Sensational Race
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19.âA fine card
was run off at Ascot to-day. Favorites
and second choices were successful in
all but two races. The five and a half
furlong event brought together a large
field of crack sprinters, including three
horses which have not started before.
Kenilworth was made favorite at 3 to 1,
but finished absolutely last. Dalvay
won easily from Tim Hurst, with Pasa
dena, the crack three-year-old, third.
The latter broke fiat-footed and was

EASTERN RACING MAGNATES
QUARREL OVER DATES
A. H. Morris of Morris Park Refuses
to Surrender His Rights to
August Belmont.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.âThe fact that
there is discord in the ranks of the
millionaires who compose the Eastern
Jockey Club and who control racing in
this State has just come to light, al
though the discord developed at a meet
ing held last Monday to allot dates for
the coming season. It was this ques
tion of dates that first caused the dif
ference of opinion which, before the
meeting finally adjourned, caused the
men of millions to think and to say
rather hard things of each other.
The trouble was caused by Alfred
Hennen Morris, representing Morris
Park race track, refusing to surrender
what he consides his rights to August
Belmont and to the latter's Belmont
Park. Belmont wanted the dates Mor
ris Park enjoyed in former years for
Belmont Park. Morris absolutely re
fused to agree to any such scheme and
now there is a deadlock that may have
some effect upon racing.
Belmont is a member of the Jockey
club which allots dates in this State.
He is also a member of.the State Rac
ing Commission, which licenses race
tracks. This commission is composed
of three men and no race track can run
without a license.
The State Racing Commission com
prises of Belmont, his brother-in-law,
E. D. Morgan, and his friend, Jotyn
Sanfcrd, of Schenectady. This makes
Belmont hold a, strong hand in issuing
licenses to raciirg associations, but the
Jockey club members control in the
matter of allotting dates.

Holmes' Lecture on Japan.
"Japan" was the subject treated of
last evening by Burton Holmes in his
series of "travelogues" now being
given at Lyric Hall. Following as
they did the lecture on "Russia," Mr.
Holmes' motion pictures and talk on
Japanese customs, habits and religion
were followed by the large audience
present with the keenest interest.
The lecture was radian of
cherry blossoms and lotus, patriotism
and politeness. The devotees of Jiu
Jutsu were treated to an exhibition of
that latest fad by a celebrated native
master, While for the lovers of natural
beauty the icy top of Fujinoyama was
pictured by reflection buried deep
within a crystal lake. The celebrated
geisha dance reproduced in the bio
graph was not the least of the many
attractive features exhibited of this
quaint Oriental people.
OIL POLLUTES
WATERS OF BAY
Sportsmen Alarmed Over
the Condition of Ducks
and of Striped Bass
QUESTION IS SERIOUS
Fish May Be Wiped Out
While Game Birds Are
Rendered Unfit for Table
The sportsmen who find pleasure in
duck shooting and in angling for
Btriped bars in and about the bay are
alarmed at the widespread injury be
ing wrought by oil which finds its way
ir.to the bay, polluting Its waters.
The most direct evidence of the in
jury to game is seen in the ducks, many
of which have been destroyed recently,
as they could neither fly, swim nor
dive. This condition is not peculiar to
any one location, but obtains on all
the bay shore, from Alvlso to the
Suisun marshes.
Some of the owners of preserves
claim that not one bird in rive of
those killed is fit for use, the majority
being saturated with oil. The splendid
canvasbacks . which have found an
abiding place In Rlchardsons Bay, near
Sausalito, for weeks, have been the
chief sufferers. Hundreds of these
birds were killed to put them out of
their misery, as they were helpless.
".Vhile the ducks are the chief sufferers
at the present time, it Is possible the
strip?d bass and other fish will be ir
reparably damaged. As the tides re
cede they leave a blanket of oil on the
shore, which kills off the clams and
other shell fish, upon which the shore
ffsh feed. It is claimed by sportsmen
that If not another drop of oil reaches
the waters of the bay it would take a
year to eliminate that already there. It
does not require a Sherlock Holmes to
determine where the oil enters the bay,
as a telltale streak leads from the
various establishments handling oil.
For miles along the bay shore the salt
grass is decaying owing to the oil de
posited at its roots at each high tide.
Chief Deputy Vogelsang of the Cali
fornia Fish Commission does not take
the alarmist view of the situation held
by the sportsmen. "The development
of the oil industry," he said yesterday,
"has brought about new conditions. In
the handling of the oil some has found
its way into the waters of the bay. The
deputies of the Fish Commission have
made regular inspections of the plants
about the bay, and they report that
every precaution is being taken to keep
the oil out of the bay. No place has
been found where refuse oil is being
turned into the bay. What reaches
there is by accident.
"There is a slight leakage from cars
and also from the many steamers in
the bay which burn oil as fuel. It re
quires but little oil to make a thin
coating over a large area of water."
The oil problem is a serious one to
the people of this city, as the striped
bass furnishes them one of the cheap
est as well as one of the finest of table
fish. The take of bass has been get
ting smaller each year, showing the
fish need proper protection.
EPPINGERS' BOOKKEEPER
CONTINUES TESTIFYING
Edmund Freund Describes the Form
ing of the Various Stacks
of Grain.
Contrary to general expectation,
former Superintendent Demings of the
defunct Epplnger & Co., grain firm
failed to appear in Judge Murasky's
courtroom yesterday. He sent word
that he was ill. In his absence former
Bookkeeper Edmund Freund testi
fied during the greater part of the day
as to the handling and marking of the
lots of wheat. Bernard Ettlinger was
on the stand for a few minutes to sub
stantiate former testimony.
Freund testified that many of the
piles of wheat were made up from
other lots, according to instructions
from Superintendent Demings. He
also said that in the course of clean
ing wheat grain from other lots be
came mixed and that identification
was Impossible in {hose cases.
The greater part of his testimony
related to the technical formation of
the wheat piles, under the direction
of the foreman. He said that at va
rious intervals when the stacking was
temporarily stopped the men would
place their lot number on the sacks.
Freund then said that for three years
prior to the failure there had been no
count of stock in the warehouse by
comparison with the books, although
formerly it had been the firm's usual
custom.
LAUNDRY COMPANY WOULD
ENJOIN WAGON DRIVERS
Three Employes Charged With Using
Information for Benefit of
Rival Concerns.
Three laundry wagon drivers, em
ployes of the Metropolitan Laundry
Company, were yesterday made de
fendants in suits for damages and in
junction. They are Alfred Johnson,
Henry Gatzert and Charles Henrich.
Each was in charge of a laundry
route for the California, California-
French and Franco-California Laun
dry Company, the property, business
and good will of which were bought in
November, 1903, by the Metropolitan
Company.
The new company retained the ser
vices of the drivers until January 2
last. It is now alleged that since the
termination of their employment the
men have refused to deliver the pa
pers, books and memoranda relating
to the customers on their routes and
are using the information therein con
tained for the purpose of damaging
the plaintiffs business. It is even
charged that they are collecting laun
dry from the Metropolitan's custom
ers and delivering-it to other laun
dries. The court is asked to order the
return of the records, for an injunc
tion preventing the acts complained
of and for Judgment for $2000 dam
ages in each case.

TO BOX BRITT
English Champion Is Ready
to Embark for This City
to Prepare for Meeting
MATCH SEEMS ASSURED
Eastern Sporting Authority
Declares Britisher Will
Make Native Son Hustle
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.âJabez White
will leave England at once to fight
Jimmy Britt late in March or early in
April before the Yosemite Athletic
Club of San Francisco. Charley Mitch
ell, in behalf of White, to-day cabled
the club to send him $500 for expenses.
While White is persistently "knocked"
by men who never saw him fight, Ref
eree Charles White, who saw the Eng
lish lightweight battle with Spike Sul
livan in London during coronation
week, In June, 1902, thinks the English
man has an excellent chance with any
man in the present lightweight divi
sion.
"Jabez White trimmed Spike Sullivan
easily," said Charley White, "in a fif
teen-round go and Sullivan was as
good at that time as he ever was in his
life. Everybody knows that Spike,
when he was right, waa a tough propo
sition, and he certainly was right for
that fight. He had been training with
Tom Sharkey and was fit. Several well
known Americans were so confident he
would win that they bet big money on
him.
"White fights more on the American
style than any fighter I saw in Eng
land. White understands the game
thoroughly."
Andy Mulligan of Washington Ath
letic Club of Hot Springs has offered
Britt and White a purse of $10,000 or a
percentage of gate receipts to fight be
fore his club.
"I do not think White will leave Eng
land before the latter part of March,"
said Manager Jim Coffroth of the Yo
semite Club last night. I have been in
communication with him for several
weeks past in regard to terms and mi
nor details and he seems willing to
make the long trip, but I cannot be led
to believe he will start for more than
two months.
"Tom O'Rourke is looking after
White's business in New York, while
Charley Mitchell represents him in the
Old World. I think the match is a cer
tainty If nothing goes wrong in the
meantime. White is willing to accept
the terms I offered him and I expect to
close the deal of matching him with
Britt in the course of a few weeks."
CONSIDERS PETITIONS FOR
LEASE OF SAILORS' HOME
Supervisors' Police Committee Hears
Requests of Two Societies to Con
duct the Institution.
The Supervisors' Police Committee
yesterday considered Jhe matter of the
lease of the Sailors' Home, for a re
newal of which the Ladles' Seamen's
Friend Society has filed a petition. The
Sailors' Protective Society, by Mar
garet Deane president, also filed a pe
tition for a lease of the Sailors' Home
for five years upon a nominal rental.
The latter petition represents that the
Incorporators of the society are quali
fied by long experience for any work
of a charitable or sociological char
acter, being affiliated with various
benevolent associations. The society
agrees if the lease is granted to give
representation on the board of trustees
to members of the principal forms of
religious belief and to endeavor to bet
ter the administration of the home.
Attorney H. W. Brown of the La
dies' Seamen's Friend Society ad
dressed the committee In support of its
petition for a lease, arguing that sec
tarian interests should not be consid
ered in the matter. Supervisor Box
ton said that the sailors or their rep
resentative should be heard on the
subject to ascertain their views there
on. He told of a recent investigation,
when some broad statements were
made that ex-Superintendent Ferem
had used his position to advance his
monetary interests.
"We can refuse to lease the home,"
said Boxton, "and in that event it
would revert to the Federal Govern
ment."
The committee decided to take the
two petitions under advisement for
two weeks and then to prepare a rec
ommendation to the Board of Super
visors.
Brown requested that if a lease was
given to any other society an equitable
arrangement be made regarding the
property added to the home at the ex
pense of his society.
DEFENSE ENDS ARGUMENT
IN MONNIER WILL CONTEST
George D. Collins Makes an Eloquent
Appeal for Justice for His
Client.
After an argument that lasted over
two days in Judge Graham's court
George D. Collins, attorney for Mrs.
Anna Monnier, closed his side of the
case yesterday afternoon with a final
appeal to the Jury for a careful con
sideration of the evidence.
He asked them not to allow them- I
selves to be swayed by any sympathies
they might feel for the contestant's
condition, and ended with a brilliant
bit of oratory in which he thanked
the Jury for the close attention they
had given the case. He also paid a
fine tribute to Judge Graham for his
impartiality and fairness during the
trial and said that "he felt assured that
Justice would be given.
To-day Matt Sullivan will close the
contestant's side of the case and it is
expected that the evidence will go to
the Jury on Saturday. Sullivan, by
previous agreement with Collins, will
confine himself within the lines laid
down by his colleague, Theodore J.
Roche, but will attempt to refute sev
eral of the allegations made by Collins
in his final argument.

Jimmy Britt Tries Mono
logue on Crowd and Ath
letes Do Some Clever Turns
The brawny Olympians put aside all
thoughts of punching bags, wrist ma
chines and handball courts last night
and devoted themselves to entertaining
their fair friends in true winged "O"
style. That their efforts to please were
not in vain was attested" by the hearty
manner in which each number of the
programme was received. All the vet
erans pronounced it the greatest show
ever given at the club, while the new
comers began to long for another such
night.
The programme was one which af
forded each star a chance to glimmer
and at the same time to give pleasure
to a goodly proportion of the audience.
The athletic tableaux, first number on
the card and an Innovation at the club,
proved a winner. Eight poses wera
portrayed by various gifted young ath
letes, ably assisted by two fair fencers.
Misses Connor and De Lambertini. The
act provoked applause and enthusiasm
galore and was a fitting curtain raiser
to a pleasant evening's entertainment.
Jimmy Britt, billed as "Mr. J. Ed
ward Britt," was ready and willing
with his monologue that won for him a
name on many an Eastern stage. Jim
my had grace, stage presence and wit
at his command and before he finished
with his initial tale his audience voted
him a success and was willing to listen
to anything the champion cared to toss
out.
The "pyramids," Illustrated by some
clever as well as husky youths, waa
another winning part of the pro
gramme. The boys went through a
number of startling acts and got away
with each of them as good as any
troupe of professionals. Jimmy Britt,
Joe Lundie, Johnny Roach and Eddie
Scc-tt showed the ladies how they use
their mitts in a mixup. Three spirited
rounds were reeled off, much to the de
light of many a demure damsel and
stately matron.
Kd Baraty and H. Miller went
through the mysteries of wrestling fof
a few minutes. Oscar Frank favored
the gathering with a couple of his fa
vorite selections, as did Miss Eugenia
Barker. Bob Mitchell was as funny aa
ever in his dialogue stunt. Signor
Domenico Russo brought the pro
gramme to a close with that ever pop
ular selection, "Violets."
Billy Stanton to Box Here.
Billy Stanton should become a pro
nounced favorite with boxing enthu
siasts to-night if he lives up to the re
ports of his prowess that have come
from Point Richmond. He will meet
Harry Riley in one of the prelimi
naries of the San Francisco Club's
monthly show In Woodward's Pavilion.
Stanton is reputed to be a slashing
fighter, who does not require a
referee's decision as a rule. He will
meet a man of the same kind in Riley,
whose four appearances have won him
many friends, whether he won or lost.
The main event needs no comment
to those familiar with the doings of
the ringsters. Joe Carroll and Tom
Sullivan are famed for their clever
ness. It is a return match, wjiich al
ways means fierce milling. Carroll
won the previous decision. Another
feature will be the Mongolian-Ethio
pian contest, which is slated as the
semi-wind-up. Ah Wing, the only
Chinese boxer before the public, and
Manuel Torres will be the contestants.
The remaining bouts are as follows:
Mike Synfy vs. Bob Cairns, at 136
pounds; "Brick" Howard vs. Kid
Christie, at 126 pounds; George San
franson vs. Charlie Dunn, at 130
pounds, and Dennt O'Conneli, vs. Jim
Bradley, at 125 pounds.

The Pacific Mail Company's liner
Peru, Captain McKlnnon, arrived from
Panama and way ports shortly before
midnight on Wednesday and early yes
terday morning was released from
quarantine. She was docked at Lom
bard-street wharf, where she will dis
charge her 1527-ton cargo. W. Gray,
owner of the British yacht Rose Ma
rine and the head of a Cocos Island
treasure-hunting party, was a passen
ger on the Peru from Panama* to Costa
Rica, where his yacht was lying.
The steamer Veronique, with the
Pari Fitzwilliam treasure-seeking ex
pedition on board, was also at Costa
Rica. According to dispatches received
within the last few days the rival
treasure-hunting parties had a serious
disagreement, in which shots were ex
changed and wounds inflicted. When
the Peru left Costa Rica, however, all
was â¢ peace among the get-rich-quick
yachtsmen, the Rose Marine people fre
quently dining on board the Veronique
and the Earl Fitzwilliam party accept

â¢ It was said in Costa Rica tnat the
Rose' Marine had visited Cocos and
discovered the underground chamber
supposed to contain the treasure. The
place was full of deadly gases and no
attempt was made to enter the cave.
Air pumps were added to the Rose Ma
rines-outfit during her stay at Costa
Rica. Gray denied the story of the
discovery of the cave, and said the
air.pumps were being taken merely on
the chance of their being needed.

John Enright, Butler, Makes
Good Use of Opportunity
to Steal From Employers
John Enright, a butler, was arrested
yesterday by Detectives Harper and
Armstrong and Policemen O'Sullivan
and O'Donnell and locked up at the
City Prison till the full extent of his
peculations can be verified. At least
two charges of grand larceny will
be preferred against him, probably
others.
Enright had been a butler with M.
S. Koshland, Washington and Maple
streets, for two or three months. He
was discharged recently and soon after
it was discovered that a large quantity
of hand-painted plates, silverware,
cutlery, champagne and other-articles,
valued at over $800, were missing.
Suspicion pointed to Enright and the
police were notified.
The police went to a flat at 2302
Fillmore street, occupied by Enright
and his wife. They found it most
handsomely furnished and on the walls
and tables in the parlor were the
hand-painted plates stolen from the
Koshland mansion. A further search
revealed most of the silverware, cut
lery and champagne stolen from the
same place. The property was seized.
Many "other articles which it is be
lieved were stolen from residences
where Enright had been employed as
butler were also seized.
Among the articles was a diamond
crescent pin, valued at $300, which
was stolen from the residence of At
torney William Mintzer. 1000 Sutter
street. It was missed at the time En
right was employed as butler there.
After some questioning Enright ad
mitted that he had found the pin in
the laundry one day and had put it in
hit? pocket.
All the property recovered in En
right's flat Is in the custody of the
property clerk at the Hall of Justice
and the detectives are on the hunt for
other people who have had Enright as
a butler with the object of ascertain
ing whether they had missed any of
thâ¬- articles seized.
MUST NOT INTERFERE. âJudge Hebbard
announced yesterday that the Board of Works
must not prevent Rebecca O. White from car
rying out the court's order to move her house
into the street until Anna Qaffney, whose
houses encroaches on Mrs. White's lot In the
Potrero, can move her domicile back one Inch.
The extra inch is needed to accommodate Mrs.
White's house, which now stands partly on the
lot and partly in the street.

ADMITS CHARGE
WAS NOT TRUE
Frank Kramer Has Narrow
Escape From Becoming In
mate of the Penitentiary
Frank J. Kramer is congratulating
himself on his narrow escape from be
ing sent to the penitentiary on per- j
Jured testimony. His case was on
Judge Cook's calendar for trial yes
terday, Judge Gesford of Napa Coun- j
ty presiding, but it was dismissed on I
motion of the District Attorney on the
ground of insufficiency of evidence.
Kramer was arrested on complaint j
of Elsie Rogers, a girl eleven years of
age, who lives at 109 Van Ness ave
nue. At the preliminary hearing be
fore Police Judge Conlan the girl gave
strong testimony against Kramer and
she was corroborated by Mrs. Eupher
nle Guthrie, who kept the lodging
house at 109 Van Ness avenue.
Since the preliminary hearing Mrs.
Guthrie has left the city. This roused
the suspicions of the police and As
sistant District Attorney Ashe. Yes
terday morning before court opened
Ashe took the girl into the District
Attorney's office and closely ques
tioned her. She confessed that the
charge against Kramer had been
trumped up at the instigation of Mrs.
Guthrie, who wanted to get Kramer
and his family out of the adjoining
lodging-house at 107 Van Ness avenue
so that she could rent it and run the
two houses.
When the case was called the facts
were stated to Judge Gesford, who
also questioned the girl and expressed
the opinion that she WÂ£>Â«Â» telling the
truth. The Judge, in dismissing the
Scase on Ashe's motion, animadverted
strongly on the action of Mrs. Guthrie,
saying it was a serious thing for any
person to advise another to trump up
such a charge against a man. He ex
pressed the hope that the woman
would he caught and punished se
verely.
Kramer was arrested on September
16 on a complaint sworn to by the
girl, who alleged that the offense had
been conihttitted on September 10.
Kramer was released at the time on
$2000 bonds and vehemently protested
his innocence.
CHAN ' CHEUNG GETS WRIT. âThe Su
preme Court yesterday granted an alternative
writ of habeas corpus in favor of Chan Cheung.
The prisoner claims that the action of th<;
Grand Jury in indicting him, for murder and
of the Superior Court Judges in refusing to
give him his release on bail is Illegal. Argu
ments in the case will be beard by the Su
preme Court in bank this morning.

REFUSES TO BE TREATED
LIRE A POODLE DOG
Works Commissioner Maestretti Ex
plains Why He Would Not Inspect
Theaters With Grand Jury-
Public Works Commissioner Maes
tretti yesterday issued the following
statement explaining why he declined
to continue the inspection of theaters
with the Grand Jury Committee on
Wednesday afternoon:
By appointment the Board of Public Works
met a committee of the Grand Jury to resume
inspection of theaters. The first theater vis
ited was the California on Bush street.
The committee, consisting of Messrs. An
drews and Bowes, made a very superficial
examlnaUon of the place. Certain trifling
technical and other violations of the building
ordinance relative to theaters were found, but
the committee did not seem inclined to take
them up seriously as they had done with the
very same defects in the minor theaters like
the Baldwin and Novelty, but they appeared
willing to gloss them over. When the com
mittee had completed its hasty observation
I asked the committee where they were going
next.
Mr. Bowes said: "We are handling this.
You can follow."
I thought this answer extremely discour
teous and, as I will not be treated like a
poodle dog by any man, even a grand Juror.
I said I had other business to attend to and |
would not accompany the committee further
unless they would say where they were going. |
It seemed to mo that there was neither s'ln- i
cerlty. dignity nor ordinary civility in the j
committee's work to-dsy. If they find any j
violations of the ordinance small or great I
shall be pleased as president of the Board of ;
Public Works to take them up if the com
mittee will appear at our office In the City ,
Hall or will send In a written report of their
findings.
I would soon become tired of following these
modern Haroun-al-Raschids through, all their
undisclosed wanderings.

New York Stock Market.
KEW YORK, Jan. 19. âTransactions on the
Stock Exchange were not so large to-day as
yesterday, but sales reached above the million
share mark and the less congested dealings in
Reading sufficiently accounted for the contrac
tion in the total. The movement of prices was
hesitating and irregular, the level fluctuating
constantly In either direction throughout the
day. The violent advance in Reading, instead
of proving an incident to the buying of Btock
elsewhere, developed Into a positively deter
rent factor. The rocket-like rise in that stock
to above 90 In the first hour proved a wet blan
ket to the speculative enthuiaam and the up
ward course which prices had taken at the
opening was reversed. "When Reading was let
back and quieted somewhat prices were pushed
upward at some other points and efforts made
to revive the animation of the market. It
was diligently sought to convey the impres
sion that the excited rise in Reading was due
to 'its heavy earnings and the highly prosper
ous condition of the anthracite trade
rather' than to any large outstanding
short interest or to any danger of a cor
ner in' the stock, as began to be feared yes
terday. Rumor continued very busy with as
sociations of a short interest In the stock
Which was In distress and there was much con
jecture as to Its Identity. At the same time
the way In which the prosperity of the an
thracite trade and the earnings of the coalers
were enlarged upon made a diversion of the
â peculation -Into the other coalers, the easiest
recourse for the market leaders. The move
ment turned first into Ontario and Westsrn and
then in the Erics. Ontario and Western had the
additional advantage of rumor* that the mi
nority bolder* would be dealt with favorably
by the newly dominant New Haven control.
Amalgamated Copper enjoyed an early advance
on, the strength of the Increase of the dividend
disbursement- by a subsidiary company and
the. expectation of corresponding action by its
own directors during ths day. But the specu
lation'ln the stock proved unusually quiet for
a day set apart for dividend act ion."and it waa
-under pressure on reaction* with the rest of tne
market. Besides the misgivings aroused by
..the -fears of trouble among a short interest
In Reading, the threatened strike of trainmen
In the Pennsylvania service caused an under
tone of anxiety throughout the whole market.
The industrial situation has been singularly
fr*4 of labor disturbances for sum* time past,
and the. intrusion of this factor aroused a
feeling of anxiety as to Its possible spread.
The reports during the day of the progress
.of the conferenoe on the subject were followed
with keen Interest. The earning* for the sec
ond week in January, which came to hand,
failed to show the same rate of Increase over
those of last year, which has been the rule
in the recent past, thus confirming the views
of traffic officials that a midwinter lull had
occurred in trad* activity. Talk of disputes
â  over Western and Southwestern grain rates
also received attention. Brooklyn Transit
. weakened on the report submitted to the State
Railroad Commission concerning the large out
lay whloh would be required to secure the ef
fective operation of the system. This move
ment and pressure against Reading and Amal
gamated Copper helped to make the oloslng
easy, .
â  There was a broad and active demand for
â  bonds of practically all grades and the course
of prices was generally upward. Total sales,
par value, $6,006,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 19.â Th* wheat market
opened fairly steady with May unchanged to
%Â©%c lower at $1 16 to $1 16%@1 16%.
Trading however, lacked animation. While
pit traders generally wer* bearish, a feeling
of uncertainty held them In check and pre
vented any great amount of seeing. The fact
that the big holders were doing nothing In th*
way of marketing their wheat had a tendency
to restrict offerings. News tn general was
favorable to th* bears. Primary receipts
showed a complete reversal of form, to-day's
arrivals being 567,100 bushels, compared with
only 871,300 bushels a year ago. During .the
first part of the session fluctuations In prices
were limited to a very narrow range. The
highest price on May was reached at $1 16V4-
Late in the day a sharp break-occurred and
May sold off to $1 14%. The decline was
primarily due to an announcement by a British
statistician that this week's shipments from
Argentina would approximate 800,000 bushels
as against 216,000 bushels last week. The
break was accompanied by heavy selling. The
market closed weak with May at $1 14%.
Influenced by higher cables and light receipts
the corn market was quite firm early In ths
day, but weakened on heavy selling and the
break In wheat. May closed at 44%Â©44%e.
Continued light receipt* Imparted a firm
ton* to th* oats market at the start, but later
prices sagged off a trifle In sympathy with the
weakness of wheat. May closed %Â®%e down
at 30%Â©310.
Only a very limited volume of business was
transacted in provision*. â At the close May
pork was off 2%Â©80 and lard and ribs were
unchanged. ______

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables.
Receipts of Potatoes were moderate and the â 
best lots of Salinas and Oregon Burbanks con- (
tinued to find ready sale at steady prices.
There was less activity in river kinds, and. ,
although prices were no lower, the market had
a weaker tone, with plenty of old stock avail- j
able. Old and trashy offerings of Sweets have |
disappeared and good cellar stock is firmer in .
consequence. One carload was marketed yes- ;
terday and cleaned up quickly at improved .
prices. Onions ruled firm at the previously : |
quoted rates.
Changes In southern vegetables were slight. ,
Choice Green Peas were firm at the top quo- (
tation. while rain-damaged lots were slow of (
sale at irregular prices. Offerings of Beans,
both green and Wax, were mostly poor and ;
only the best stock was wanted. Summer < .
Squash and Egg Plant were in Increased sup- i
ply and lower. Mushrooms were abundant i .
and weak at sharply reduced prices.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The feature of the market for fresh fruit* !
was the arrival of half a chest of Raspberries ,
from Watsonvllle. The berries, which were
grown in tho open air, arrived late on Wednes
day and were of unusually good quality. The
ten drawers comprising the half chest were
readily disposed of at $2 60 per drawer, or $50
peg chest. The market for Citrus fruits was
devoid of feature. Standard Navels, Tan- >
gerines and Mexican Limes were in good re
quest but otherwise the market waa dull. Four
cars of Navels will be auctioned to-day. There
were no new arrivals of Apples and the choice
and fancy grades were quoted higher. Trade
was less active than previously, as the ad- '
vance checked the demand somewhat, but the
market still had a firm tone.

Plenty of Buying Orders on the Stock '
and Bond Exchange.
There waa no falling off in business on the
Bond Exchange yesterday. All the brokers
seemed to have plenty of buying orders and j
the bidding for both stocks and bonds was
lively In both sessions. As usual when buy
ing orders are plentiful the feeling was firm
al! along the line. Ths upward tendency in
the sugars wss not unanimous and several i
hesitated, but per contra several touched still
higher prices. This was notably the case with
Hawaiian Commercial, which advanced to 885,
against 888 as Wednesday's quotation. Hon
okaa sold us to 828 25. Paauhau to 836 75
and Honolulu! to 837. The other sugars were
sensitive, but fairly steady. Transactions In
Paauhau were very large, aggregating 2468
shares at $26@25 76, against 825 as the best
price of the preceding day. The total sales
of sugars were 5180 shares, against 2615 on
Wednesday. The sugar bonds were also Arm
and Hawaiian Commercial 5s sold up to
8106 50.
The miscellaneous stocks were also firm,
Alaska Packers advancing still further to
691, while Gas and Electric rose from 861 12%
to 853 25. Bank of California fell back a
point to 8445.
There was nothing especially interesting in
the mining stocks and the oil stocks worn

TUPPER HAS FUN
WITH WITNESS
Barrister From Victoria B.
C, Worries J. J. Dwyer in
the Dunsmuir Will Case
EXPEKT MUCH CONFUSED
Former Minister of Justice
Tangles Him Skillfully
in Hot Cross-Examination
The monotony that marked the pre
ceding five days' testimony in the
Dunsmuir hearing before Courtenay
Bennett, the British Consul, was
broken yesterday when Sir Charles H.
â¢Tupper began his cross-examination of
J. J. Dwyer, who has been testifying
â¢ aa an expert on California probate law.
â¢It was apparent from the start that
the smooth sailing of Dwyer's direct
examination by Attorney Charles S.
Wheeler was going to be disturbed by
the former Canadian Minister of Jus
tice. Sir Charles' very first interroga
tories started Dwyer on a line of lo
quacious but mere or less evasive an
swers, which were seldom either af
firmative or negative.
"Mr. Dwyer," the barrister from
Victoria at last said, "are you willing
to shut out the fact that you are called
by any particular party and testify
simply in the Interest of this case?"
Dwyer said he was anxious to give
his testimony to the best of his knowl
edge and belief.
"And do you also understand that
you are called here as an expert upon
the law?"
Dwyer also assented to this. Nev
ertheless, he resumed his early manner
of answering, and continued it until
the hearing closed. Sir Charles asked
Dwyer why in all his testimony he had
been careful to avoid the use of the
phrases "ancillary probate" and "do-
mestic wills." Dwyer sharply an
swered: "I have not been careful to
' avoid these phrases, nor did I intend
either to use or exclude them. There
is no mention of the words 'domestic
will* in our code."
Then came a long discussion upon
the subject of the term "foreign
wills," brought about by Dwyer's cita
tion in his direct testimony of the case
of the Goldtree will, made in London.
In his original testimony Dwyer did
not seem to consider the Goldtree will
as a "foreign will," but under a hot
fire from the cross-examiner he finally
admitted that he did consider it a "for
eign will."
At one period in the game Dwyer
said to Sir Charles: "Your questions
confuse me; they are so involved."
Sir Charles quickly countered: "Are
you confused and involved, or do my
questions confuse and involve you?"
The witness said that he had been on
the stand for five days and had cited
so many cases and talked so much that
he was compelled to ask that the ques
tions be made plain and distinct. He
added that Reporter Clement Ben
nett's frequent requests that he speak
slowly increased his confusion.
At the close of yesterday's proceed
ings the attorney for the plaintiffs.
Mrs. Edna Wallace Hopper and Mrs.
Joan Dunsmuir, asked that they be al
lowed to recall J. A. S. Lowe to the
stand- for further cross-examination. A.
P. Luxton, attorney for James Duns
muir, said he would consult his asso
ciate counsel. Mr. Wheeler, before
agreeing to produce Lowe in court.
The cross-examination of Mr. Dwyer
will be continued this morning.

UNTYPED TROTH
FAILS TO HOLD.
GIRL AVERS BOTBROKE AWAY
Exhibit A Shows They Posed
Where Wavelets Murmur.
Nineteen-year-old Toral Thorsen of
41 Eleventh street distended her natur
ally large eyes as she informed Police
Judge Mogan that of course her en
gagement to marry 20-year-old Frank
McFee was no secret. All of their mu
tual acquaintances knew of the be
trothal and had congratulated both her
and her affianced. Moreover, she had
a ring to show for it. The hoop of
gold was placed on her engagement
finger by Frank as they posed on the
; Ocean Beach, with the Cliff House for
' a background, and had their tintype
' taken. (Tintype offered in evidence, ac
| cepted and marked exhibit A.)
When the coldness came between
Frank and herselfâsaid decline of tem
perature being entirely of his making
âhe said he would ever think and
speak kindly of her, but soon she as
certained that he was gossiping in a
way that did not reflect credit upon her
character. That was one of the rea
sons that prompted her to prosecute
' him for breach of promise. She told
I her friends, after the severance, that
| Frank had always treated her as a per
fect gentleman would treat a perfect
lady, but of course she could not ad

j covered the manner in which he was
i talking about her.
I Toral's mother corroborated the
| young lady's story in detail, and told
of how, after she had been informed
of Frank's recalcitrancy, she accom
panied Toral to a dance for the sole
purpose of finding out for herself what
he meant by it. He informed her he
j meant nothing, but his wooing was
never renewed. She had encouraged his
suit because she knew that Toral loved
him and could not be happy without
him, and she afforded the couple every
possible facility for uninterrupted
sparking: Toral never loved anybody
before she became the fiancee of Frank,
nc.- had she kept company with any
member of the opposite sex since
Frank proved untrue. Indeed, if Frank
were not compelled to make her his

bride she would end her days a spin
ster.
Police Judge Mogan will hear more
of Toral's sorrows to-morrow. During
the examination young Mr. McFee sat
with his mother and seemed to enjoy
the proceedings, especially when his at
torney's rapid-fire questioning provoked
the young lady to snappy answers.

Jane Doe Eckert, mother of six, waa
accused of defrauding an innkeeper by
removing her family baggage from
Mrs. Jennie A. Hammond's lodging
house, 5% Polk street, and leaving two
weeks' room rental unpaid. Mrs. Ham
mond averred that the removal was
effected with deliberate intent to de
fraud her, but Mrs. Eckert maintained
that she was compelled to leave the
house by "Mrs. Hammond's Insulting

James Graham, a young man of be
sotted appearance, laughed derisively
when Judge Mogan sentenced him to
three months' imprisonment for habit

whose complaint he was arrested, testi

Miss Belle Wilson had doffed her
black picture hat and was jabbing two
long wire skewers with large glass
heads into it when Bailiff Hickey in
formed her that Police Court etiquette
aid not require any such manifesta
tion of respect to the bench.
"Respect nothin*," said Miss Wilson;
"I took off me hat to let them pore fel
lers in th* cage behind me see what's
goin' on. We do it in theaters, an' I
don't see why we shouldn't do it
here."
She was accused of pilfering $75 in
gold coin from James Ferguson of
Martinez, and she listened to his tale
of woe \Vith as much nonchalance as
If she were an entirely disinterested
party. When, he said, she "flagged"
him on Market street she laughingly
and audibly remarked that if she did
so she must have been crazy, thereby
conveying to all hearers the impression
that she considered him beneath her
notice. His recountal of how he had
treated her to refreshments until ob
livion came to him provoked her to
giggle, and she fairly Jellied when he
told of his return to consciousness in
a Market-street lodging-house and
finding himself bereft of the $75.
His subsequent disorderly behavior,
he explained, was due to the night
clerk's insistent demand that he either
leave the house or ceaae his wailings
and allow the other lodgers to sleep.
He naturally expected condolence, he
added, and when he received harshness
instead he may have disturbed the
peace. He would not deny that his
chagrin was accentuated by the re
flection that In Martinez he was re
garded as a very sophisticated chap
and that much Joshing by the wags
will be his portion when he returns to
that town. No, he had never bought
a gold brick, nor had he over purchased
green goods warranted to be undis
tinguishable from genuine currency. In
fact, until he responded to the "flag
ging" by Miss Wilson he considered
himself proof against capture by
means of any of the snares that beset
the stranger in the metropolis.
Miss Wilson Informed Judge Mogan
that on January 27 she would submit a
defense so formidable as to make Mr.
Ferguson regret the day he caused her
arrest. The big-headed pins were
clenched tightly between her teeth as
she spoke, and the hissing enunciation
thereby created made her words sound
extremely convincing. But her hat was
not donned until she left the court
room.

Frank Daly and James Murphy in
vented and operated a system of street
begging that came so close to highway
robbery as to earn for them three
months' imprisonment, ordered by
Judge Mogan. They worked aa a team,
and their field was the Western Addlr
tion. The process, as described by the
arresting policeman, consisted of Mr.
Daly accosting a belated pedestrian on
a quiet street and soliciting alms while
Mr. Murphy stood ready to back his
partner's play by intimidatory toying
with a large knife. If the citizen yield
ed to Mr. Daly's appeal there was noth
ing for Mr. Murphy to do except stand
Idly by, but if there waa indication of
the petition being rejected, then Mr.
Murphy went to work. He did not orally
threaten to use the knife, but simply
weighed it in his right hand and drew
his left forefinger along Its keen edge,
meantime eying the citizen most male
volently. If the citisen attempted to
retreat, Mr. Murphy silently stepped In

GIVE DINNER
TO JUDGE HUNT
Superior Justices Do Honor
to Man Who Served City
for Twenty-Five Years
PRESENT FLORAL PIECE
Cosmos Club Has Token for
Jurist Who Has Been on
Bench a Quarter Century
The Judges of the Superior Court of
this city gave a banquet to Judge John
Hunt last night at the Cosmos Club
in honor of the quarter century of serv
ice he has rendered upon the Superior
bench. Judge Hunt has served since
Superior courts were established by the
State constitution in 1879. He was seat
ed as a Superior Judge in 1880. In rec
ognition of his faithful service he has
been returned at each succeeding elec
tion. Through all political changes he
retained his popularity and the respect
of the people.
Judge Hunt was deeply touched at
the regard shown to him by his col
leagues, who were enthusiastic in their
congratulations. The Cosmos Club pre
sented the veteran jurist with a beauti
ful floral piece representing a balance.
This was used as a center-piece on the
banquet board.
The cuisine was excellent and the
wine of the best. Over the coffee the
Judges recalled members of the bar
long dead. Anecdotes of the pioneer
courts were told and the stock Jests of
the legal profession were recalled.
Goodfellowship reigned throughout the
affair, which lasted till after midnight.

to assure a clear coast for murder, if
that extreme should be made necessary
by the citizen's continued obduracy.
Most citizens thus virtually held up,
however courageous they might be or
dinarily, considered life worth more
to them than the modest sum of money
solicited by Mr. Daly. But some of
them narrated their experience to the
police, and thus Messrs. Daly and Mur
phy were caught in the act of perform
ing their specialty.
That the defendants had planned
their method of mendicancy with a
view to avoiding possible conviction
for footpadry was exemplified by the
Insistence with which they pleaded that
no actual threats had been made by
either of them. They dared the prose
cution to pro*/e that either by word or
deed had they shown intention to take
by force what they failed to obtain by
suasion.
"As for me pulling out me knife an'
paring me finger nails," said Mr. Mur
phy, "I guess any gent has a right ter
do dat without bein' serspected of goin"
ter stick somebody."
"I'll give you half the limit for
vagrancy this time," said the Judge,
"and if you ever again indulge in such
spectacular manicuring and are
brought before me to answer for It six
months shall be your portion."

H. O. Newman, proprietor of a
Hayes-street delicatessen, was acquit
ted of the charge of selling milk de
ficient in butter fat, his Honor Mogan
declaring that it was easier for a camel
to do a flying leap through a needle's
eye than for a committing magistrate
to probe to the bottom the "buck-pass
ing" defense submitted by the average
vender of debilitated milk. If such de
fenses were to be believed, the court
further intimated, the pump or hydrant
from which the complained-of water
was procured was alone answerable for
the illegal dilution. Even the cow could
not be convicted.

Archie Northway, an opium devotee
who attempted to wreck the Salvation
Army Lifeboat on Natoma street, reso
lutely declined Bailiff Mahoney's invi
tation to step out of the cage and face

"L.ay not your hands upon me," he
shouted, as the bailiff started to enforce
his command: "for he who touches my
person withers up and dies."
Several of his feljow prisoners assist
ed in Mr. Northway's expulsion, and
the Judge promptly gave him three
months.

Space in the Ferry Building
May Be Eeassigned for
Benefit of the Key Koute
State Treasurer Truman Reeves has
advised the Board of Harbor Commis- 1
sioners that the plates and proofs of j
the new bonds for the extension of the
seawall are ready for inspection. With
as little delay as possible the bonds
will be offered to the public. It is ex
pected that the securities wilf command
a premium in the money market. The j
bond issue is limited to $2,000,000.
A reassignment of space in the ferry !
building to give better accommodations
for Key Route travel may become nec- I
essary. Commissioners Spear, Kirk- ;
Patrick and Mackenzie considered the
subject yesterday and several altera- '
tions on the lower floor of the north
end of the building were suggested in
order to accommodate the Santa Fe
with ticket offices, waiting room and
baggage space in that quarter. If the
plans under advisement meet the views
of CaptAin Payson, the North Shore
offices will be moved nearer the center
of the depot, and the slip now used
by the Tiburon boats will be assigned
to the Santa Fe steamers. Accommo- I
dations for all the lines of travel could
be easily provided if the companies
carrying passengers would make gen- i
eral use of the extensive space on the
second or upper floor of the depot. Cap- '
tain Payson, A. W. Foster and the
Key Route people will have to "give
and take" in order to reach an agree
able adjustment. The Commissioners
are not inclined to make an arbitrary
ruling.
The board, at a regular meeting yes
terday, which was attended by the
three Commissioners, the attorneys and I
chief engineer, resolved to build the
Vaiiejo street pier at an expense of 1
$90,000, exclusive of cement. The engin
eer was directed to prepare specinca- j
tions for cement.
The board resolved to spend $10,000
to repair the Souther nPaciflc freight
slip in Central Basin. Owing to heavy
winds and tides and the careless hand
ling of boats by the company, the slip
has been materially damaged. Bills for
damages will be presented to the
Southern Pacific. Informal proposals
for the repairs will be considered and
the company itself may bid.
The Commissioners yesterday decid
ed to invest $5000 in a modern up-to
date scow piledriver. The engineer
reported that it would be cheaper to
get a new scow than repair the old
boat.
The board, on advice of Attorney
Davis, yesterday adopted this resolu
tion:
Whereas, in the cases of Schultz, Hansen
& Co., Webster A Dunbar. Jonas Erlanger-
Davls Company and O. B. Olcese against the
board, the temporary injunctions restraining
the board from acting under its orders re
voking the permits of said firms to sell perish
able products on the wharves have been dis
solved; now therefore be it
Resolved, That the secretary notify said
firms that the board will on February 1. 1906,
enforce its order revoking said permits.
The following bids for treating piles
for Jackson and Howard street
wharves were received: San Francis
co Timber Preserving Company, 36
cents per foot; H. R. Rood & Co., 40
cents; Parafflne Paint Company, 35
cents. The paint company's process
of treatment is not acceptable. The
bid of Rood & Co. was held by the en
gineer to be much lower than that of
the Timber Preserving Company, as
the former charges only for the preser
vation of the submerged portion of the
pile. The contract was awarded to
Rood & Co.
The Commissioners will attend the
Governor's reception at Sacramento
next Wednesday night.

terday in the form of a civil suit to
set aside the gift. Kleineberg is ad
ministrator of Kruger's estate and the
property that has come Into his pos
session is worth only $2. As Kruger's
physician he rendered services for

CAUSED COLIC
Ferris Hartman's Heir Gets
"Tummy" Ache and Mother
Has Police Investigate
What gave Ferris Hartman's son and
heir a "tummy ache?" That's the
problem that is puzzling the domicile of
the Tivoli comedian, two detectives,
and all the rank and file of the San
Francisco police force.
A blood curdling theory is advanced
by Catherine Giles, Mrs. Hartman's
maid. She was talking to a "gentle
man friend" at the front door on
Wednesday night, she said. As she as
cended the stairs she heard a noise.
Just what kind of a noise she does not
know, only that It was a noisy noise.
She peeped into the room of her mis
tress. All was well, and little Ferris
was asleep. Paregoric had silenced his
innocent prattle for the night.
Mrs. Hartman rose at 4 the next
morning and complained of feeling
drowsy. Baby Hartman complained of
everything in general, and indicated
that something was wrong with its lit
tle insides. A diligent search revealed
no safety pins.
Suddenly the maid discovered a bump
on the baby's forehead. "Mon Dieu,"
she cried. "I see it all! The enfant haa
been sandbagged and you have been
chloroformed. Mon Dieu, what mis
creants! I will fly for a gendarme."
So Mademoiselle Giles sought out Po
liceman Schmidt. "It is terrible. The
enfant and the wife of that celebrated
Ferris Hartman have been sandbagged
and robbed," she cried.
The policeman learned on investiga
tion that Mra Hartman's collection of
jewelry was intact and that none of lit
tle Ferris's milk steins had been ab
stracted by midnight marauders. But
there remained the mystery of the
"tummy ache."
Detectives Dinan and Wren were dis
patched to solve that. They gazed at
the window, where the sandbagger of
infants was supposed to have entered.
It was thirty feet above the sidewalk.
"Maybe the baby wants its pa," sug
gested Dinan, "Or else it's got colic."
"Rub some arnica on the child's
head," said Wren. "If the bump don't
come off, it's a phrenological freak, I
guess."
The disturbance in young Hartman's
interior abated lar' night, but its fond
mamma does not know yet whether it
was chloroform or colic that upset the
child.
Ferris Hartman might solve the
problem, but he is visiting barns
throughout the State. So the riddle of
the baby's indisposition remains as
hard a riddle as its father's, "Why
doea a chicken cross the road?"
KNOCKED DOWN AND ROBBED.âEd
ward Isaacs, a salesman living at ISI6 Webster
street, was found unconscious on Oeary street,
between Webster and Buchanan, shortly after
midnight yesterday morning by Special Officer
R. Harvey and Policeman Rocca. After he re
gained consciousness he said he had been struck
from behind with some blunt Instrument. Hs
bad $2 70 in his pockets, which had been stolen.
There was a slight wound behind his left ear.
Blow Destroys His Hearing.
Because she thought he dumped
rubbish in her back yard, Jennie
Clarke, a negress, living at 22 23
Beach street, smote Henry Johnson
yesterday with a baseball bat. The
blow temporarily destroyed Johnson's
hearing and Dr. Carl Wilson, at the
