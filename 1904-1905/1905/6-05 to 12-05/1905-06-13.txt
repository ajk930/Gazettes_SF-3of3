thieves, evidently possessed of tho
knowledge that Mrs. E. L. Edgar was
alone In her home, seven and a half
miles from this placed this afternoon
entered the house and proceeded to ran
sack the place. She discovered them
at their work and was rushing, from
the. house # to give an alarm when one
of the thugs intercepted her and threw
her to. the floor. Mrs. Edgar screamed,
and her assailant commanded her to
keep silent or suffer the consequences.
Mrs. Edgar plucklly attempted to break
away from the thug and. disobeying his
command to-- Vkeep ouiet." screamed
again. With a cursÂ« the burglar
grabbed her by the throat and again
threw ', her ,to the floor. Cruelly ha
closed his 'fingers about the, poor
woman's throat, and, though she strug
gled fiercely, he did not ' loosen his
grasp until sho had lost consciousness.
Leaving' his victim stretched uncon
scious upon . the floor the thief joined
his 'companion and - went through' tha
house, picking up everything of value.
.When C they left the house they took;
with them considerable money and, jew

,-\Some time' after they had left Mrs.
Edgar revived and staggered out of tho
house to summon help. Neighbors.re

CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. June 12. â Protests
against the severity of the enforcement
of the Chinese exclusion law were made
to the President and Secretary Metcalf
to-day by members cf the American Asi
atic Association Â«nd representatives of
the American Onton Manufacturers.
President Roosevelt denied that there was
undue severity in the treatment of Chi
nese by immigration officers, but ex
pressed his purpose to do all in his power
to 1 promote American trade with China.
Secretary Metcalf plainly intimated to
the members of the association â¢ that it
was not possible to Jet down the bars to
any extent in the matter of exclusion.
Member?; of the delegation who entered
protests because of the threatened boy
cott of American goods in China there
fore got little or no satisfaction from the
interview.
John Ford, pecretary of the Asiatic As
sociation, read a lEcmorial to the Presi
dent and Mr. Roosevelt said he would
refer the matter to the Department of
Commerce and Labor. Afterward some
of the officers of the association called on
â¢Secretary Met calf. Among other things
the memorial said:
"Mr. President, the American Asiatic
Association is an organization formed to
co-operate with this Government in maln
\iairang and defending the trade and
treaty rights of the United States in the
countries of Eastern Asia.
"The occasion of this visit is to invite
your attention to the present unsatisfac
tory relations with the Chinese empire
and the conditions growing out of those
which directly threaten the continuance
of a profitable and highly essential part
of our commerce. The friendly character
cf those relations has been of late ad
versely affected by the absence of a sat
isfactory immigration treaty between the
United States and China and by the dis
satisfaction of the mercantile * class in
China with what they conceive to be the
unjust and oppressive operation of the
rules adopted and enforced by the immi
gration officers of the United States in
dealing with those of their countrymen
whom our laws declare entitled to visit
the country.
SEE MENACE TO TRADE.
"It must be held to be unfortunate that
these laws are at variance with the treaty
stipulations which, since the expiration of
the treaty of 1*54, are in force between
the two countries. We are not here to
question the competency of Congress to
mortify the provisions of any treaty with
a foreign power but we do question the
expediency of the Government of the
United States occupying an attitude in
opposition to the principle which it has
long maintained, that a nation cannot
plead its domestic legislation as a bar to
the observance of its international obli
cationsi
"The treatment accorded by tha immi
gration officers of this Government to the
exempt classes of Chinese visiting , our
country is more oppressive than either
the letter or the spirit of \u25a0 the law re
quires. Moreover, the plainest principles
of internal conditions demand that the
law shall be made more ..beral either
by amendments or by the negotiation of
new treaty or both.
"W<e urge upon you the extreme danger
to the industrial and commercial inter
ests of the United States of allowing the
conviction which has been growing for
some time in China, to become a fixed
one that our Government tries to dis
courage the coming here of the mer
chants, students and . literati ; of that
country. The future of \u25a0', that vast ; and
populous empire Is with tue young men,
who; have almost ceased to resort to our
schools and colleges for their 4 education
because of the humiliating ordeal to
which the administration of our immigra
tion law exposed them, and other coun-
PORTLAND, June 12. â The most per
fectly appointed train that ever came
Into the Portland depot brought the
California Promotion" Cominittee~ar-Â«:Sa
o'clock this morning. One hundred and
twenty-five representative men of tho
Golden State . were on board. ,\
Five minutes after the airbrakes closed
on the moving wheels at the Union sta
tion half a dozen telephones were con
nected inside the cars and the Califor
nians were calling long distance to talk
with their home offices. No sooner had
the train come to a standstill than a
messenger stepped aboard with all mall
addressed to the members of the party.
As though they were veteran campaign
ers under discipline, they were marshaled
in line and taken to the Portland Hotel,
where every ebneeivaole fietail had been
arranged beforehand by Edward P* An
trom, secretary, of the Promotion Com
mittee, who came here a week ahead.
Their tickets were marvels of ingenuity
and thoughtfulness. with coupons for
everything that pertained to the trip.
From the moment they stepped on
board until they leave the cars Saturday
coupons for berths, meals on the diners,
street car fare to the hotel for breakfast,
carfare to the grounds and admission to
the exposition and every other movement
of the party was provided for by these
wonderful tickets.
Hospitality without precedent, even in
a city with a world-wide reputation for
it, was showered on the visitors by the
Portland business men. President H. W.
Goode, his assistant, Theodore. Hardee;
Vice President I. N. Fleiscnner, "W*. D.
Wheelwright, president of \u25a0\u25a0 the Chamber
of Commerce; Thomas Richardson, man
ager of the Commercial Club; Fletcher
Linn of the Manufacturers' Association;
Samuel Connell and F. A. Spencer of the
State Exposition Commission; A. V. Dev
ers. L. Allen Lewis, J. H. Thatcher. W.
D. Fenton, C. A. Dolph and many, others
were ready to give the ' hand of good
fellowship and welcome the visitors to the
exposition city.
They took them to breakfast at the
Portland Hotel, accompanied them to
the exposition, grounds and took
luncheon with them in the American
Inn, after there had been an exchange
of compliments in the formal speech
making in . the auditorium of the "fair.
They will not forget their duties as
hosts until the Calif ornians ' leave
Thursday evening-.
California poppies adorned the lapels
of almost every coat in the. town s 4
even the street cars bore streamers in
BTeen and gold, the colors adopted iby
the committee.
"We're not here to boom California,"
said Rufus P. Jennings, executive officer
of the Promotion Committee, "but we
came to show the people of .the world
that the Lewis and Clark Exposition Is
ours as well as yours, andf that' any
thing that makes for the good of the
Pacific Coast has .our good will. This
fair is broader than one State. It is" too
big to be monopolized by Oregon. : The
fair belongs to every, loyal lover of the
land of the setting sun."
This was th 6 spirit In which the Cali
fornlans came to Portland this morning.
Since the opening of the fair nothing,
has happened to arouse the cityj to
abounding " hospitality as has the ' Pro
motion Committee's ; advent . to-day. *- A
brilliant reception was heldlthis even

the Southerners met the best people of

complaint"; signed :by H. D. Loveland.
president of the' Jobbers' and Manufac
turers* Association, and by Seth Mann,
attorney for the association," was for
warded to the Interstate Commerce Com
mission yesterday, .
Not only is -it asked that the Southern
Pacific Company shall desist from I the
practice to which the merchants object,
but also that the defendant corporation
shall be ordered and required; to make
reparation and restitution to the com
plainants by refunding all amounts here
tofore or, hereafter charged or collected
as described.
The effect of charging State tolls on all
freights that enter this city t over the
lines of tho Southern' Pacific Company is
to cause San Francisco to pay $1 \u25a0\u25a0more
per carload," or 5 cents per ton, than is
paid by any, other.' terminal point on the
Pacific Coast: Not only are Seattle, Ta
coma and Los Angeles favored 'by the
amount of-Jl a : carload as against San
Francisco, for? the .nearer at hand ter
minals in this State north of Tehachapi
are better off to the amount of the State
toll than is 7San Francisco. The tax
against the interests of San Francisco in
flicted by the \ tolls amounts to a large
Bum, reckoned in the thousands of dollars
every year. I The coast line of the South
ern Pacific.. Company was completed in
1900. The practice of charging State tolls
via. that route was brought in ] imme
diately on the- opening of the through
route via Santa '\u25a0- Barbara, and has been
continued ever since. .

To the Chief of Police yesterday Mrs.
Ida May Smith, who lives at'a'."rooming
house at 930t4 Mission ;sueet, made the
statement that in IS7O her foster-mother.
Mrs. Elizabeth Merrill, : wlio
then lived in a chouse at 228 Post
street, where she kept lodgers, killed at
different times two young Norwegian sail
ors and one mining man, her object being
to obtain their money, and burled two of
the bodies In the cellar and threw the
other into a barrel of quicklime there.
In addition to. this, Mrs. Smith says,: Mrs.
Merrill had previously ."- murdered a ' den
tist named '-Cool ridge in , Boston because
ho kne-w of her having contracted a big
amous marriage. . . " â¢ : .
So -startlinsr is the story of. the many
murdere told by Mrs. : Smith that there
hÂ» a natural impulse- not to . give ; them
credence, but she, has not the appear
ance of an insane . person. She ' looks one
squarely, in the ese and -all . her dates
and statements fit " in - proper- / sequence.'.
She nientions names of persons she says
existed in San : Francisco at the' time of
tho alleged "-murders ;and? who, she says,
may have-, some descendants to "..whom
they imparted" corroborating .circum
stances, but every one who could, give
that corroboration ''.'directly seems to be
dead. . The enormity.; of t;ie charges she
niake3 gives pause as to belief ; in ;them.
In addition to the terrible crimes said
to have been committed" here she un
ravels a mystery that had all Boston ex
cited I nearly â¢ forty years according
tiiHier. storj'. :
- There is : a ' serious : discrepancy in Mrs.
Smith's story in regard to the* many per
sons supposed to have been placed: under
the sod. :; She says that George; Green, one
of the characters in her tale," is dead. She
must -refers to | the '] George? Green ; who Is

never was killed, as vras { the Green ' of her

Hence a hearing is asked for and a pro
hibition and restitution cf tolls collected
a& described in the complaint.
The imposition and collection of the
tolls where none are paid by the defend
ant corporation are declared to be unrea
sonable and unjust and in violation of
(fiction l cf tho. Interstate Commerce
lav/. Terminals within the State of Cali
fornia are San Francisco, Sacramento,
Marysvilie, Stockton, Oakland, San Jose
and Los Angeles. None of these with the
exception of San Francisco pays the toll
of five cents a ton and, accordingly, un
due discrimination against the Ean Fran
cisco and an undue and unreasonable
preference and advantage in favor of
other Pacific terminals exists, so it is
charged, in violation of sections 2 and 3
of tht Interstate Commerce law.
AVhen the coast line was put into oper
ation freights began to come Into . the"
city without crossing the bay of San
I'rancisco and have continued to so corae
in large quantities. Concerning this .the
â¢comp'aint says specifically:
"Upon all of this' freight no State tolls
or charses accrue, no State tolls or
charges are charged or collected by said
Harbor Commissioners and no State tolls
Â«r charge are paid by the defendant.
But notwithstanding the said defendant
pays no tolls upon said freight, it de-
Tnarids, charges and collects said tolls In
addition to the freight rate upon said
freight from the consignees or shippers
thereof, as the case may be, pursuant to
t-itid provision of the westbound tariff,
and continues to add said ! additional
t harge for tolls in its freight bills for said
freight and to exact the payment thereof
apainst the protests of plaintiff and San
Francisco consignees, and continues to
n:ake, promulgate and enforce the eald
provision of the said westbound tariff."
DISCRIMINATION EXISTS.
Oakland, whence it was transported by
f- try boats to San Francisco, and all the
freight â¢passed across the State water
lront frjr delivery to consignees within
this dry. The Southern Pacific Company
has collected and continues to collect the
iol!s on freigats passing over the State
water front by adding the same to the
.freight rate in accordance with the pro
visy.ons of the Transcontinental Freight
Bureau westbound tariff.
SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS.
"I hope we can formulates report that
will be satisfactory â¢to and in keeping
with the views and policies of President
Roosevelt, and I think the j other mem
bers of the committee, feel the -same way.
The committee adjourned subject to the
call of the President. Of course, it is
the general understanding that Congress
will convene In extra session in the fall,
but whether It does or not the committee
expects to reassemble before the next
session of Congress, and we also expect
at that session to arrive at some conclu
sion. I feel certain the majority of the
committee wishes to coincide with the
views of the President."
OMAHA, Neb., June 12.â Senator Mil

F. W. Waterhouse, vice president and

$30,000. He said the building was valued
at $30,000 and that it was' separated into
two parts by a fire ;.wall. -The flames
only damaged the rear portion' of ; the

ance.

On the eighth floor, where theVflre

of Fire Marshal Towe that the blaze was
the result of spontaneous combustion.
On the four floors underneath were stored
quantities of wagon wood and flimsy
material -which furnished food for the
flames. < .
Flames burst forth from the wagon and
hardware material establishment of Wa

the blaze under control the center of four

firemen were unable to get at it. The
damage will amount to about $30,000, fully
covered by insurance.

CHICAGO, June 12.â 1f , before the Su
perioi Court adjourns to-morrow after
noon, the Chicago River gives, up the
body of William A. Hartley, the third
victim cf Saturday night's automobile
tragedy at the Rush-street bridge, Mrs.
Mattie Jane Hartley will be declared his
widow and the legal heir to his large, es
tate. Unless .the body be found t}Ve wo
man will be declared a divorcee by. Judge
Patton and be left penniless. '\u25a0 . .
Mrs, Hartley. Is in th.e_extraordinary po
sition of not knowing whether she is a
\u25a0widow, "a divorced woman, or,, if a mir
acle should occur by Hartley being found
alive, which the court holds is possible,
she is still a married woman.
The fact that Hartley, a.few'hours pre
vious to the accident, obtained a nom
inal divorce by the failure of his wife to
appear, before Judge Patton, the court's
failure to have the evidence written up
and the necessary documents signed, fol
lowed by Hartley's . sudden- .death; pre
sents one of the most remarkable legal
puzzles on record.
Mrs. Hartley appeared before Judge
Patton this afternoon to ascertain her po
sition before the law. Â»'
"There is legally no proof that Mr.
Hartley is dead," said the Judge, "and if
no proof Is forthcoming by Tuesday's ad
journment of this couri, nothing can pre
vent the decree being signed. Should the
body be recovered before this court" ad
journs, there Is proof of the man's death,
anfl you are his widow. A divorce cannot
be granted to a man known to be dead."
PORT DE FRANCE. Island of Marti
nique, June 12.â For the past few . days
Mont Pelee has manifested a renewal of
activity which, while stronger than that
of the month of April of the present year,
does not seem to be of an alarming na
ture. Some dense clouds of smoke have
been discharged from the volcano and
have slowly fallen over the -White River
Valley, afterward disappearing at the sea
coast. Sharp luminous flashes have been
perceived at the dome of the mountain
and a flame was Veen oh June 3.
On that day a thick cloud of smoke al
most descended to the sea and the cin
ders thrown up extended to the village
of Le Precheur, which is on the extreme
line forming the limit of the territory
devastated during the terrible outbreak
ot May, .1902, resulting In the loss of
about 40,000 lives. After this, the volcano
again, became, calm and remained so un
til the night of June 10,, during which the
dome was illuminated \u25a0 by internal .fire, i
The collapse of part of the dome oc
curred yesterday , morning at . 6 o'clock.
It was accompanied by. an outflow of
mud In the White River Valley. During
the same morning a dense cloud of smoke
arose from the crater to a height of about
1000 yards and extended toward Le Pre
cheur.
J'lt is believed the, destroyers' were -sent
on ahead.of "the" rest, : of, the; fleef'to get

From surrounding complications the
Lumbermen's Local No. 224 of the Inter
national Marine and Transport Workmen
has a complex situation before it. This
union holds its charter from the interna
tional /organization, but it is affiliated
with the City Front Federation, paying
dues to both.
At a recent meeting of the Sailors' Un
ion application was made to the City
Front Federation requesting that body to
ask the lumber workers to withdraw
from their international, or a i severance
of affiliation would be the penalty. .
The City Front Federation forwarded:
this resolution |to the Lumbermen's Un
ion. The disposal of 'this matter brought
a full attendance of the local lumbermen
to the meeting last, night.. . . , ' . ,
The situation . was debated from . all
points. Some were in favor of staying
with the City Front Federation because
of its local Importance in case of a' strike
or, other troubles, while others were
equally firm In their determination to re
main loyal to the parent body. Among
the 800 members ' belonging to. this union
there is a variety of opinions as to which
course to pursue, for, as one speaker
said jat the meeting , last night, "we are
between the devil and 'the blue sea, and
no matter in which direction we move we
fall into a peck of trouble." V
The subject will be further ventilated
at the next meeting.
At the meeting of the Journeymen Bar
bera* Union. last night a delegation from
the. Machinists' Union was present to so
licit co-operation in the Interest of the
condemned man, Buckley, who was con
victed and sentenced to be hanged for the
killing of Bice .during the machinists'
strike a few years ago. It is proposed to
obtain the 'sanction of Superior Judge W.
P. Lawlor, before whom Buckley was
tried, to intercede with Governor Pardee
for a commutation, of the death penalty
to life imprisonment.
The barbers will pay a social visit to
their brethren in Oakland on next Mon

sian experiment in parliamentarism will
begin in September. The Emperor has
already given his approval to the scheme
now being finally, but formally, re
viewed by the Council of State, for a leg
islative body consisting of a lower house
called the Gosudarstvennaia Duma (Im
perial Duma), and an upper house, Gosu
darstvennaia Sovet (the present Council
of the Empire), with power to formulate
legislation, ; discuss the budget. Interpel
late Ministers, etc.. but reserving In the
Emperor's own hands the final authority.
The. elections, will take place during the
coming summer.
. Although the scheme clings with des
peration to the essence of autocracy, it
marks the beginning of the end. vhe
die once cast, there can be no retreat and
the. quasi parliamentary regime which
will.be inauguratedVill prove to be mere
ly a transitory bridge over which abso
lutism must cross to constitutionalism.
Peace and a . constitution appear simul
taneously on the Russian horizon.
The proclamation of Parliament, either
in the form of a manifesto or as a ukase,
will be promulgated within a few years. .

MEAN DOOM
OF AUTOCRACY
It is explained that not a single officer
of the fleet knew the Commander-in
chief's plans. The admirals in command
of divisions knew, no more than the sub
lieutenants, and had to reply only on the
signals of the flagship. Admiral Neboga
toff t upon whom the command devolved,
had' seen Rojestvensky only once after
the juncture of \ their squadron and then
only for a few minutes. .
All the stories of! extensive target prac
tice in Madagascar,' it seems, were false.
During the entire voyage there practically
wasno training in gunnery worthy of the
name, and the big gun practice was con
fined to three shots per vessel.
Ugly stories are told of the occurrences

ST. PETERSBURG. June 12. â The
warring countries both having for
mally agreed to try to conclude peace,
the next step, it Is explained here, will
be the first direct exchange, in which
Japan is expected to take the initial
step by indicating, doubtless through
an intermediary in Washington, .her
views as to the time and. place of the
meeting. Russia will offer no objec

this resoect. - â¢ '\u25a0\u25a0'; f

probable choice of the belligerents for
their place of peacemaking would not
preclude the selection of an American
city. Briefly the situation is. this:
Japan does not wish Paris, and Russia
,1s unfavorable to Mukden or Chefu. Both
"are opposed to Washington for climatic
reasons, . though neither would oppose the
selection of an American watering place,
and among those already mentioned are
Newport- and Manchester-by-the-Sea.;
This idea is especially favored among the
representatives of the neutral powers,
who establish their embassies and lega
tions In New England for the summer.
Of the places under consideration in
Europe, it Is said Russia might accept
The Hague. Geneva also- is considered,
and would not be objectionable to Japan.
A long conference at: the Russian Em- V
bassy this evening between Vanswinderin,
The Netherlands Minister, and Count Cas
sini, the' Russian Embassador, strength
ened the belief that Russia^ would seri
ously consider the selection of The Hague
for the scene of the negotiations.
A point realized by the representatives
of both belligerents here: and which .has
been emphasized In their dispatches is
that," in order to take \u25a0 advantage' of ; the
President's offer to give any advice or
assistance that might be solicited, the
selection of any American city for, the

: Kojestvensky's position was cramped
and his transports were badly placed and
caused copfusion. While the Japanese
were raining projectiles even from ma
chine guns on the Russian ships the lat
ter were huddled 'together, blanketing
one another's fire. Only the leaders of
the columns could bring their guns to
bear, and even on those- the untrained
gunners fired wildly. To make matters
worse, the mines and floating torpedoes
sown in the paths of the Russian divi
sions added to the confusion. The Boro
dino, the Admiral Nakimoff and the Nav
arin fell victims to these obstructions.
It is a heartrending narrative that Rus
sia and the world should know. The sail
ors and officers were not altogether to
blame. The main fault lies *elsewhere. \u25a0
. There were many heroes among' the
Russians. Captain Berkh of the Oslabya
committed suicide on' her- bridge as the
ship sank rather ' than save himself.
There were thousands of other heroes
whose names the world will never know.

Elimination of Washington as;-. the"
Conferences of J supreme Importance
were had to-day in Washington. The
blue room of the White House was the
scene, and President Roosevelt, Count
Cassini and Kogoro Takahira, the Jap
anese Minister, were the principal con
ferees.
President Roosevelt now has unequivo
cal assurancts from both Russia and Ja
pan, of the acceptance of his proposition
that they enter on negotiations for peace.
The President likewise is assured of the
absohite sincerity of both governments in
acceding to his suggestion.
Japan was the first of the two pow
ers to indicate its acceptance of Presi
dent Roosevelt's proposition. The for
mal response to his Identical note of
Thursday last was received from the
Japanese Government on Saturday. In
formal assurances of acceptance of the
President's suggestion were received
from the Russian Government a little
later, but they were not of the same
definite character as those received
from Tokio. Early to-day Embassador
Meyer, in St. Petersburg, informed this
Government that Russia had accepted
the President's proposition and would
name representatives with plenipoten
tiary powers to meet plenipotentiaries
of Japan. While satisfactory, the re
sponse of Russia was not in the same
definite form as that of Japan. It had
been the expectation of the President
to publish to the world the replies of
the two governments to his identical
notes, but under the circumstances this
could not be done. '
CASSIXI REMOVES ALL. DOUBT.
A few hours subsequent to the re
ceipt of Embassador Meyer's cablegram
Count Cassini, the Russian Embassa
dor, made an appointment to see Presi
dent Roosevelt at 11 o'clock to-day.
The Embassador. in ,the conference
which followed, presented verbally
Russia's acceptance of the President's
proposition*for=a conference to discuss
peace terms. He had been instructed
by the St. Petersburg Government to
convey to the President /the willing
ness of Emperor Nicholas to appoint
plenipotentiaries to meet like repre
sentatives of the Emperor of Japan to
negotiate a treaty of peace.
While the response of the , Russian
Government was not reduced to writ
ing, it was regarded for the ' time as
sufficient for the negotiations. Shortly
afterward the official statement quoted
was made public.
In addition to indicating the accept
ance by the Russian" Government of
President Roosevelt's proposition Count
Cassini Informed the President of Rus
sia's desire as to the place of meeting
of the plenipotentiaries and named
those who probably would be delegated
to represent the Russian Emperor. At
the conclusion of the conference Count
Cassini declined to <ilscuss for publi
cation the details of his interview with
President Roosevelt.

Minister Takahira had a conference
with President Roosevelt at 3 o'clock

WASHINGTON, June 12.â The follow
ing official statement regarding to-day's
conference between President Roosevelt
and Count Cassini, the Russian Embas
sador, was issued at the White House
to-night: i
"Embassador Cassini has called to ex
press the Russian Government's assent
to the President's proposition and to state
that it would appoint plenipotentiaries to
meet the plenipotentiaries of Japan to
discuss the question of peace. The pi^ice
of meeting is at present being discussed."
During the past two weeks the Presi
dent's efforts have been directed toward
a mutual agreement to consider terms of
peace. This he accomplished finally to
day. It remains now for the belligerent
powers to name their â¢ plenipotentiaries
and agree upon" a time and place for them
to meet to discuss terms and to negotiate
a treaty of peace. These details are now
under consideration, with a bright pros
pect that such minor differences as may
exist will be overcome within a few days.

Loevland said he thought that Nor
wegian interests would not suffer during
the interim in which the country would
not be represented abroad. Fortunately,
he said, Norway's biggest trade was with
vJreai Britain. \ Germany, the United
States and France, where for a short
period Consuls were not indispensable.
â¢â¢When our case Is presented to the
powers," said Loevland, "it will be seen
that it is not one of antagonism to the
people of monarchies or to a single mon
archy. Norway has been a kingdom for
many centuries and is proud of the fact.
The dissolution of the union was purely
on constitutional grounds. Our constitu
tion existed prior to the union with Swe
den and when this union caused a con
flict between the two peoples, Norway
chosÂ«> to retain her constitution.
"The action taken by the Storthing is
irrevccable/\and the powers should real
ize the fact that Norway will fight before
this action is reconsidered. The question
of peace rests with Sweden, but the early
recognition of our independence will be
cf interest to the powers as well as to
ourselves."
Regarding the probable difficulties to. be
encountered, Loevland declined to express
an opinion, but he said that the envoy
would convey the best wishes of Norway
to the powers and would go to them with
the highest hope as to the successful re
sult of his mission.

Mrs. Fiske and her clever company in
"Leah Kleschna" began their second
and last week at the Majestic Theater
last night. <
Tlvoli.
The musical comedy, "The Tender
foot," entered upon its last week at
the Tivoll Opera-house last night to a
delighted audience. .
One of the. best bits of .acting seen
at the Central last evening was con
tributed by Grace Hopkins, the. young
leading woman, who has already be
come a pronounced favorite. Gamble
is well cast and greatly adds to. his
popularity. Corrigan gives a good
characterization as the old Italian.
Henry Shumer was as usual the
villain and was realistically mean and
bad. Miss Ellsmere was graciously
cast In a light role and afforded much
amusement as the bothersome wife of
the detective, played by George Web
ster to much advantage
Scenic effects v in abundance, strong
heart interest and laughable comedy
are the elements that make "The Fast
Mail," as produced at the Central last
evening, one of the best successes that
theater has v ever scored. : \u25a0 \u25a0
Central.
There is a laugh in about every line
in the last act of "Mistakes Will
Happen," at the Alcazar this week, and
the fun is frequent and genuine all
through the play. One reason is that
the play abounds in the drollery of
Charles Dickens, with some American
witticisms and more horse play than a
circus thrown in. The other reason is
that the fun is so evenly distributed
among the several parts that all the
stock company has a chance to shine.
Last evening was the opening. The
audience was large. The players were
\u25a0jn excellent mood. The result was a
performance to drive dull care away
from all who were present. Mary
Young did a nice bit of dialect work.
Adele Belgarde had the eyes and ears
of the auditors, especially their eyes.
Craig, Lillian Lawrence, Ruth Allen,
Howard Scott, John B. Maher. Hilliard
and Henry D. Byers were all in the
cast. Cleverness was the rule. The
opening performance was good. To the
Alcazar for laughter this week.
Alcazar.
charming personality and at once
pleased her audience. She showed
emotional qualities of a high order and
in the role of Mona Mylrea had ample
scope to show her abilities. Alfred
Woods was the big hero of the play, in
which he was compelled to run the
gamut of almost every kind of emotion
known in the modern melodrama. He
satisfied the demands of the audience,
judging by the liberal applause he re
ceived. W. R. Abram as Davy Fayle
did an excellent bit of character acting.
P. S. Barrett as Jarvis Kerrish was a
villain of the deepest dye. .The rest of
the cast, which is a long one, was ac
ceptable. "The Gates of Bondage" will
run to the end of this week. Next week
"A Woman's Sin" will be the bill.
Mr. Goodwin exhibits his usual incom
parable bonhomie as John Maddox, the
usurper. Miss Ruth Mackay as Miss
Clive, with a remarkable resemblance to
Margaret Anglin in voice and manner,
and Miss Georgie Mendum as the usurp
er's typewriter, both reach into Mr. Good
win's admirably human key. The same
may be said of the Rob Quentin, an ex
cellent bit of character work by Felix
Edwardes. Goodwin is still and always
the most human of actors. He could play
Chaunccy Olcott and make him human.
He makes the "usurper" human, fat with
fun, and cunningly finished and rounded
is everything he does. You would miss
an amusing Goodwin in missing "The
Usurper." It is not his fault that it is
not the best Goodwin we have had.
Miss Mackay is notable in the sup
port, not otherwise so notable, for a
clear and eloquent enunciation and
charming voice. She is graceful, pretty
and dramtically accomplished. Georgie
Mendum as the typewriter girl succeeds
exactly as Mr. Morris desires her to
fveceed. It is the typewriter girl of
the comic papers and Miss. Mendum could
not be better. Norman Tharp confides
too much of- his pleasant juvenility to
the audierice, as does Miss Florence
Parker as Polly Maddox. They both talk
to the audience instead of to each other,
which, as they are stage lovers, is at
least unusual. Mr. Ellle Norwood talks
more to himself. As Sir George he was
not easily heard. The rest, including
Felix Edwardes, filled in with more or
lew distinction. The play is prettily
staged. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
I. N. Morris is the author of "The
Usurper." One fancies Mr. Morris first
incurably young and then rampageously
American. The scene of the play is Eng
land, anywhere, in a castle in the coun
try. Mr. Goodwin is "the usurper," and
the man in possession. The usurper has
bought the place with the stipulation that
the native aristocrats go with it. Of
them is the young woman whom ten years
before as a girl, as a visitor to a Texas
cattle ranch, the usurper has fallen in
love with. But Miss Clive is already en
gaged. She is engaged to the villain.
Sir George is a lovely villain, by the way.
You know him the minute you see him.
He is none of your strange, human mix
tures, god and devil, and all the bewil
dering shades between. He has an all
black "cartâ as the English butler would
sayâ and would seem to have strayed
from the Central. There is an aunt of
Miss Clive's who has owned the castle
and who occupies herself chiefly in ad
ministering preposterous snubs to the
usurper. This Lady Dulverton's son,
comedy juvenile, a servanr maid and her
escaped convict papa, and the usurper's
sister are the other dramatis personae.
Mr. Morris by no means lacks ingenuity
in his plotting. Some of the situations, as,
for instance, where the usurper and the
heroine are locked in the ghost tower,
are piauant and amusing. His weakness
lies chiefly in the inconsistent depiction
cf character. The usurper* himself, the
"American citizen" sort of hero, is plaus
ibly enough drawn. Yet that role needs
all of Mr. Goodwin's art to save it from
being of the unpleasant "spread-eagle"
type. Miss Clive, again, is of most cha
meleon-like changeableness. At one mo
ment she is rushing to the lover <Sir
George) with whom she is going to elope.
The next finds her lengthily explaining
the wonders of the ghost tower to the
usurper. Mr. Morris has asked even
more than the usual feminine license for.
his lady. The rest of the characters are
sketchily filled out, depending almost
wholly upon the acting.
Pity one cannot take "The Usurper" to
the woods. Seen from a hammock swung
under a redwood tree, through lazy, half-
Bhut eyes, Nat Goodwin's latest play
might convince as thoroughly as it
amused last night at the Columbia. The
comedy hardly pretends to probability.
Mr. Goodwin does not' pretend that it is
probable. But Mr. Goodwin's fashion of
poking it, himself and you in the ribs is
perhaps more enjoyable than any mere
matter of probability in the play. At
least a very lively summer audience so
approved it last night. Certainly Mr. Good
win's local vogrue was never more viva
ciously demonstrated. After the third act
they wanted the usual "few words." But
Mr. Goodwin was coy. For a solid and
joyous five minutes to a blank curtain
they kept up the shouting, and then the
comedian appeared. It could not have
been the austerity of his welcome, but
Mr. Goodwin expressed his sorrow that
"he had never been born a Californian.
but if it were to occur again- he knew
what he was going to do," etc., with his
coat buttoned to his chin. Altogether the
audience made very much of Mr. Good
win and seemed to like his play.

â¢NEW- YORK, June 12.â The organization
of the largest trust , company in the
United,. States- arid, one Â£of .the;.: largest
financial Institutions -'â¢ .'of â¢: the ;'world* was

Hyde. Ryan's : plani j was l reported . tb^-day
to be ' to \u25a0 consolidate \ the Equitable Trust
Company, the Mercantile Trust Company
and the Morton Trust Company, all of
this city, with the last named in control.
It is stated that this would result .in
creating a financial institution with de
posits second only to those of the Nation
al City Bank of New York, which has
deposits of $185,000,000. The deposits of. the
proposed consolidated .trust company
would amount : to ,1169,000,000; the capital
stock J7.000.000 and' the surplus $22,000,000.
Ryan's plan was reported to-day to con
template also the elimination of the con
trol of subsidiary companies by the Equit
able Life Assurance Society. ' : r ; '<
Former President Cleveland has writ
ten a letter 1 to Thomas F. Ryan , concern
ing the trusteeship of the stock of the
Equitable, , which .he accepts., The letter
was made public to-day and is as follows:
i "After a little reflection, I have deter r

assume this duty* upon the express con

are to act formally in -voting for the 1 di

"While the hope that I' might aid in
improving the plight' of the' Equitable So
ciety has led me to accept the trustee
ship you tender, I cannot rid myself of
the belief that what has overtaken this
company is liable to happen to * other
insurance companies and fiduciary organ
izations as long as lax ideas of -respon
sibility in places of trust are tolerated by
our people. The high pressure of specula
tion, the madness of inordinate business
scheming and the chances : taken" in new

present temptations, too often successful,
in leading managers and directors away
from scrupulous loyalty and fidelity to

During- the day- underground travel
was practically suspended, although
some trains were run below Fourteenth

insulation and ties. - \u25a0
Powerful steam pumps Installed yes

have materially reduced. the depth of the
water, but not sufficiently to determine
the full extent of the damage to the
roadway. The few trains that were
run were scantly patronized and as a
, result traffic was diverted to .the ele
vated and surface lines, whose capacity
was taxed to the utmost.,, f , i ;
During . the afternoon" the_. elevated
railroad running through Fulton street,
Brooklyn, was put out of commission
by an accident similar to the one that

poured. such a torrent into the subway

Mr. Shroder^There Is one line of questioning
The suggestion is that this . firm of John D.
Park & Eons Company,, is . fighting Hartman
and the trust organizations/as they are called,
which are- encaged In this business; that this
firm lc outside nnd Independent; but at the
same time are trying to get ' these goods by
Indirect methods, and the trade secret i set up
here , Is that \u25a0 If Park . discloses â¢ the t names \u25a0 of
the men he uses to fraudulently obtain goods
from Hartman it", will' prevent him inth? fu
ture from fraudulently'obtainlng goods in that
way. \u25a0WoM.r.that is hardly 'a' trade secret that
should be protected by \u25a0: the \u25a0 courts. . <- . - \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 , ;
Therefore, â¢in the opinion of. the court, the
testimony fought to be elicited from this wit
ness. Ambro R. Park, Is ' relevant as tending
to shew this fraudulent scheme by which the
Pejuna was obtained from Hartman.
The witness repeats . over and over again
thtt the answ-ers to the questions put to him
will not Incriminate him or will not subject
him to a penalty or forfeiture; but, as I have
already stated, his sole; ground for refusing
to answer Is that the Questions are Irrelevant
to the isFues'in the case pending in : the New
York ; courts, and - that the answers thereto
would disclose trade ' secrets.i The court. ls of
the opinion that the \u25a0 testimony is entirely
relevant, and that there; are no trade secrets
disclosed." â¢ . ."\u25a0--. \u25a0 ". .'-- . . â¢ \u0084Â»s
In the first place, as to the relevancy of the
testimony sought to" be elicited by these ques
tions: .The ca*e sought to be made In the re
plevin suit Is this: That McKessen & Robblns
and Charles H. Ixiveland and John D. Park &
Sons Company, conspiring together . for that
purpose, fraudulently obtained a carload of
Peruna from plaintiff, and that the plaintiff,
when he discovered the fraud, promptly repudi
ated the contract of sale, tendered back the
purchase price 'which had been paid and re
plevlned the goods. In order to maintain the
suit, therefore, :It Is necessary to "show (that
the possession of these goods was obtained by
fraud practiced upon the plaintiff, which Justi
fied him In repudiating the contract. . .
1 do not care to discuss the question" of the
right to repudiate, the contract; I think there
can be no question about that. McKessen &
Kobbins and Loveland both had contracts. with
Hartman to enable them to procure Peruna,,
and the claim Is that In /violation of these
contracts, they entered Into a conspiracy with
John D. Park & Sons Company to obtain Pe
rura from Hartman and ship it to that com
pany, the company being" engaged quite" exten
sively In the business of selling Peruna, and
having no relation or contract with Hartman
which would enable It to obtain Peruna in
any other way.
If this be true, undoubtedly Hartman had a
right to repudiate the sale and retake the
property. But it is said the contracts with
McKessen & Kobbins and Loveland are execu
tory, and that Hartman must look to them
for darnaccs for the wrongful disposition of the
goods, and cannot attack the sale. The charge,
however, as I understand it. Is that this partic
ular carload of Peruna was obtained by a fraud
practiced upon Hartman; and in furtherance of
the scheme by which John D.' Park & Sons
Company, sought to obtain. Peruna, -when they
could not otherwise have obtained it. . The
representation of McKessen & Robblns to
Hartman was this: "Under our contract we
want to buy this Peruna, put It upon the
market and cell it as your agents, as we
have been doing heretofore," when In fact
that was a misrepresentation; they did not
want It for any such purpose, but wanted It
for the purpose of selling It . to John ' D. Park
& Sons Company, In violation' of their con
tracts with Hartman.' \u25a0.'â¢'.; '. . ?-\u25a0-

been taken, and have in mit^d ' the questions

a bullet hole through his head was found
in the fields near this city to-day. There
was evidence of a struggle and from all
indications the man was murdered. He
was about 2? years of age and was well
dressed. There was no weapon near the
body and this fact leads the authorities
to believe that crime has been committed.
The body was badly decomposed and the
man had probably been . dead for several
days.
Robbery was evidently the motive, as
the man's pockets were rifled. It was
dÂ«veloped by the Coroner that the victim
had been seen in the city several days

Although 1 the East River tunnel is prac
tically being bored through solid rock,
Pearson does not consider it 'as difficult
as the Thames River bore through
treacherous sand and gravel; which gave
way several. times and almost flooded the
tunnel. In order to prevent its .collapse
under the weight of forty feet of water
at high tide the - men worked In short
shifts in an atmospheric pressure of
twenty'pounds to the square inch. The
boro was made by an immense steel shield
in the face of which the workmen oper
ated. This Is also being used under the
East River. The shield is driven forward
by means of hydraulic rams, while the
bore is kept clear of water encroachment
by means of compressed air. Engineers
some time \u25a0 ago pronounced the feat of
boring under the '.Thames River an im
possible '\u25a0, one, but the tunnel was com
pleted and was formally opened by Prince'
Edward, now King of England.
Sir "Weetman Pearson (Baronet) Is a
member of Parliament He has recently
returned from" -Mexico, where he has at
various i times undertaken and completed
great public works for the Mexican Gov
ernment, including the vast Mexican Val
ley drainage canal, costing $15,000,000, and
the Tehuantepec Railroad, which hopes to
compete Iwith the -Panama line. Presi
dent . Diaz considers , the Tehuantepec
work,- with its bridges over deep chasms,
Its " tunnels under great mountains ' and
the Atlantic and Pacific terminals and
deep sea harbor works, as wonderful en
gineering feats. â¢
t Sir /Weetman Pearson expressed great
admiration for the enterprise of Ameri
can railroads. Although his firm has been
accustomed to handle big contracts.' the.
enormous outlays of money being made
for . improvements by some of the; rail
roads in "the United States, notaoly- the
Pennsylvania Railroad, he says, wouldbe
enough to /stagger the imagination of .the
average | English or ; continental railroad
company, sHe considers the Pennsylvania
a' model of perfect railroad equipment.
..Pearson's r work for the Pennsylvania
will^ be > completed within three to five
years.;,' He has returned to London, but
expects soon again to visit this country,
at which - time' he may make a trip to
California.
'- The Southern Pacific , officials, however,
realize that the popular . and increasing
requirement of greater speed will neces
sitate the tunnel sooner or later, in addi
tion to a ferry or bridge at that point
The Central Pacific has for a long time
had under consideration the plan to
bridge the narrowest point of the bay.
. Pearson's firm is now engaged in boring
tunnels under East River, from New York
to Long' Island, for the Pennsylvania
Railroad.' The Pearson firm is the largest
concern of this kind in existence and at
the' present time has works aggregating
$80 000,000 under way in various parts of
the world. This firm built the London
subway - also the Blackwell tunnel under
the Thames River at London. This tun
nel is one and a quarter miles long, the
roadway sixteen feet wide and the; tube
twenty-seven feet in diameter.
NEW YORK, June 12.â 1t Is understood
that when . Sir Weetman _ Pearson, the
great ; English contractor, ; was y m this
country ' recently *en route,: home ' from
Mexico he was consulted In a casual way
by Central Pacific officials concerning the
feasibility \u25a0of tunneling an arm of San
Pablo Bay to a point at or near Benicia,
CaL, in order to obviate the â¢ necessity of
ferrying trains across I this bay on boats.
No ; definite ~ conclusion was reached, the
conversation being merely Incidental to
the discussion of other business matters.
Not " having seen , San Pablo Bay, Sir
Weetinan 1 Pearson could not give an opin
ion offhand, and, of course, in the ab
sence "of reports of Southern \u25a0â¢ Pacific or
his own engineers could make no authori

the work or give a rough estimate of its

President Fitzgerald referred the reso

OAKLAND. June 12.â The case of Dan
iel W. Doody. formerly secretary of the
Board of Health, whose appointment to a
position Â«n the Street Department was
blocked a week ago. was again under
consideration to-night by the City Coun
cil. As the Board of Public Works had
officially declared its authority over the
Street Department and had also an
nounced that no extra deputies were re
quired by the department, the Council
to-night heeded the legality of the
board's stand by rescinding its action
naming Doody. But Doody's friends in
tho City Council did not let the fight to
get the place for him stop there. After
the decks had been cleared of last week's
resolutions a fresh one was sprung cre
ating the position of Assistant City Clerk,
at a salary of $125 a month, and appoint*
ing Doody for the job. The resolution re
cited that the Street Committee of the
City Council required such an assistant
to investigate petitions, protests and oth
er communications relating to street
work. Councilman Elliott In a sarcastic
ppoech suggested that Doody be given
authority over the Fire and Water Com
mittee, of which the Councilman is chair
man, and he concluded:
"We will see that Doody is both well
watered and fired." ' \u25a0

Ing United States District Attorney Black
.yesterday ordered the dismissal of the
suit of the -United States against Charles
P. Bremner and others to recover 123.770,
the estimated value of. timber alleged to
have been cut from Government land in,
Lassen County/, by. the .defendants and.
manufactured: by .- them . iuto' lumber .. at
their mills in, Sueanvllle.;.. The- timber is
alleged ; to -.have \u25a0: been cut continuously
from December 24, ISS7.- to August 30, 1594.
The suit was filed on May 29, 1896, under
tTTe; administration of Henry S. Foote,
United -. States- District Attorney. . The
suit from that time to this was allowed
to slumber In the pigeonhole until United
States District Attorney Robert T. Devlin
instructed Mr. Black to overhaul the of
fice catacombs. The papery were found
covered with. dust where they had been
placed.' . â¢ \u25a0
Mr. Black informed the Attorney Gen
eral of the antiquarian discovery and of
the further and more important fact that
the- records failed to show any evidence
upon .which .the United States could re-
, cover a dollar !_of the money. The Attor-.
ney General reported back that all the
witnesses "and .the other evidence in the
â¢ case seemed to be dead, and that It

Robbins will be arraigned to-morrow
in" the Police Court before Judge
George Samuels.
I Detective . Holland to-day located
j where one bullet had cracked a window
and had been imbedded in the casing
of Goldberg, Bowen & Co.'s store,
across the street from wnere the shoot
ing occurred. Another bullet plowed
Into the Congregational Church on t the
opposite corner.
Dunn swore to a complaint -to-day
charging Robbins with an assault with
intentto commit murder. Robbins was
released on bonds, his sureties being
Fred Osgood and C/"N. Wood. The ac
cusation is made against Robbins on
the ground that though he did not do
the actual shooting he 'was an accom
plice to it if the charge be proved.
Concerning the- case Dunn Â» said to
day: â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ \u25a0
"I .want to repeat that no woman
was connected with this affair. The
trouble is that for a long time Robbins
has been nagging: at me every time, he
was \u25a0in .liquor. ,1 have.: tried to avoid
him, because I realized "i he was not en
tirely responsible, having been an .'in
mate of a sanitarium some time ago.
If be is insane he should' be put where
he cannot endanger lives. He tried to
have me murdered, and I purpose to see
that he shall not get another such'op
portunity as he took Sunday morning:.
His story of the encounter is a
of lies, his denial that a pistol was
used being indicative of the character
of his statements." .
OAKLAND, June 12.â The police have
verified, beyond question the charge
made by .Frank W. Dunn that a third
man attempted to kill- him while he
was In an altercation early, Sunday
morning: . at Thirteenth and Clay
streets with Lee Robblns, formerly a
realty broker. . . , .
Witnesses to the firing of two shots
from a pistol aimed at Dunn while he
was on the ground have been located
by Detectives Holland and Shorey .in
the- persons of . Frank Davis, a hack 4
man, and Joseph P. Mead, a newspaper
business manager. Mead, the detectives
say, saw a man in a light overcoat run
around Dunn and Robbins as they
struggled- on the sidewalk and lire the
shots.

in one of the papers to be presented- at
the meeting.
The president of the association is

anthropological department of the Uni
versity of California as well as of Har
vard University, and it was largely in
recognition of his services In directing
the building up of anthropological re
searches and a department at the State
University and the rapid development
of its anthropological museum througrh
the liberality of .Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst
that the council of the association voted

OAKLAND, June 12.â There was a live
ly fight at' the session of the Board of
Supervisors this morning over the award
ing of the contract'to supply the county
with . voting . machines. While i it was
plainly evident that Supervisors Bowe
and Talcott on the one side would be out
voted by Supervisors Mitchell. Kelly, and
Homer, the two members by. strenuous
endeavor : finally had. the matter put; off
for a ; week', and the two bids,' that of the
United * States Standard Machine \ Com:
pany at $675 a machine and : that, of -the
Dean Balloting .Company at . 5650 a ;ma
chine, were referred to the District At
torney for his inspection.
: Before the bids were opened Supervisor
Rowe introduced four resolutions couched
in different . terms but providing for the
inspection and a general test of Ihe ma
chines. During the: discussion, over the
measures 'Supervisor Mitchell , accused
Rowe of having introduced the resolu
tions in the interest of the Standard ma
chine, and Rowe : retaliated by, accusing
Mitchell of misstating the report of :a
committee in regard -. to the purchase of
machines. The upshot o! the matter,
however, was that a committee of three,
consisting jof Kelly, Homer and Talcott,
was appointed to provide for a general
inspection of the machines by the public.
There were a large number of interested
persons present, including Clerk of the
Supreme Court Frank OA Jordan, who
represents the , United States Standard
machine, arid State Senator Leavitt, .who
is the representative of the Dean
machine. If the tests are satisfactory^
is likely that the Dean Company, having
put in the lowest bid, will be awarded
the contract. It was the contention sof
Rowe and Talcott throughout' the pro
ceedings that as there would \u25a0; be no
election for some time to come there was
no need of being in a hurry to : place
a large order for machines and that 'all
should be thoroughly tested.

Several prominent players have had
their- tennis careers cut : short by indulg
ing In five-set matches In, the terrific heat
that prevails In July, at San Rafael. Con
trary to expectation,', the . motion to
change .the number of. sets was carried
unanimously.". This change means much
to the tennis cracks. In future endurance
will not cut as much of a figure In tennis
as In the past. It is a game of skill in
which the cleverest players ; should win
and not the ones with the most stamina.
It is to be hoped the preliminary matches
in September will also be made to con
sist of two sets out or three.-
An admission of 25 cents will be charged
to witness each - days. play.
The following delegates ; were present:
Dr. , . Hardy, Percy; Murdock, Charles
Kuehn, J. M. Baker, D. Gay ness and
Grant Smith./ .".
. An important meeting of the delegates
to the Pacific States Lawn. Tennis Asso
ciation was held yesterday. The chief
object of the meeting \u25a0 was to - appoint a
tournament committee to manage the
State championship tournament. This
tournament, together with the - ladies'
championship, will be held on the Hotel
Rafael courts from June 30 to" July 4. The
following committee was appointed: R. T.
Crawford, chairman; Percy Murdock and
Harry Rolfe. Dr. Sumner Hardy was ap
pointed referee.
There will be several innovations in the
coming tournament.. These will be the
charging of an admission to witness the
games and the shortening of the matches
in the early rounds of tne tournament.
For several years a few of the players
have endeavored to have the matches In
the preliminary rounds consist of two sets
out of .three "instead af ; three out of five.

The members decided to tender a ban
quel to National President McCabe on his
arrival here on June 16.
According to the law of the association,
each club must have a bona fide gymnasi
um and a certain membership. It was on
the ground that the clubs did not possess
these requirements that the Grand Jury
stopped the game several months ago.
The- registration committee decided last
night to establish a separate branch of
thr Pacific Amateur Association in the
Northv.ost. Thr field has increased to
such an extent in the north lately that
the local body finds it impossible to han
dle th<- business there, so the new branch
â¢will soon be established to attend to all
the business in that section of the coun
try. The new annex will be known as the
Pacific Coast Northwest Association of
the Amateur Athletic Union.
The applications were received last
night by the registration committee of the
Pacific Amateur Association, George
James. Max Rosenfeld and C Robert
Ryan. That it is a move on the part of
the promoters to revive the amateur game
is admitted beyond question. The pro
moters found it was impossible to go
ag-ainst the Grand Jury any longer, so
they have adopted the only means left
for them to revive the game.
The reprf tentatives of the three clubs
promised the committee that they would
comply with the law and rules of the as
sociation to the letter. They are willing
to let bygones be bygones and promise
to be good if they are admitted to mem
bership once again. The promoters of the
San Francisco Club announced that they
Intended erecting a splendid clubhouse at
Fourteenth and Folsom streets to cost
17008.
The promoters of the "amateur" fight
clubs of this city have realized ihat the
earne is about all in unless they can
manage to gtt back into the Pacific Ama
teur Association. Last night applications
Â»*cre received by the association from the
Hayes Valley. San Francisco and Bay
City clubs, but they were laid over till
v vote of the entire association can be
taken on the matter. The Hawthorne
C!ub was formally reinstated to member
chip, the organization having put in its
application several weeks ago.
It looks as though a merry old war will
bÂ«- waged when the time for voting on the
applications rolls around. Several mem
bers of the Pacific Amateur Association
are bitterly opposed to reinstating the so
calkd "amateur" clubs and it is under
stood they will do all In their power to
keep the three organizations out of the
fold.

â¢ The pierced or stiletto embroideries, such as grandmothers loved to makeâ
we presume they loved the work from the quantities of it their wardrobes
showed, but It was certainly a rather trying form of needleworkâ have swept
.all before them this summer. Not only are they seen on cambrics and linens,
but on silk as well. An effective blouse Is of white raw silk, the yoke quaint
ly pointed and extending in a panel to the waist line in front and back. The
body of the blouse is shirred on beneath the yoke point and the sleeve tops
shirred in corresponding fashion. The sleeves are double* puffs, with long
gauntlet cuffs to the elbow. The entire design Is in the pierced work, the
edges of the yoke and panel being buttonholed with charming effect.

An ' English Judge recently altered a
sentence of eighteen months' hard labor
to five years' penal servitude because the
prisoner threw, a bottle at him.
ATTEMPT is made to treat the indictment and trial of the
President of the Board of Works as a personal attack made
for its effect upon local politics. Those who urge .that view
jump to the conclusion that his acquittal vindicates the local admin
istration and ends the reform movement in the politics of San Fran
cisco. Xo greater mistake was ever made by the push. The indict
ment of Maestretti was incident to the conviction of the three ballot
box stufters. The public prosecutor would have failed in his duty
had he not procured that indictment. The prosecution of the Presi
dent of the Board of Works was noth'irig more nor less than an at
tempt to enforce the law made to protect the purity of the ballot,
and that prosecution is not. impeached by the verdict of'a petit jury.
The reform movement goes on unchecked. Its case was not
submitted to the jury that tried Maestretti. It was submitted months
ago to the greater jury of the people, and was indorsed and has flour
ished, and will continue to grow in the atmosphere of a public
opinion that knows the need of a better political condition in San
Francisco.' The conviction of three ballot-box stuff ers is a fact. that
cannot be cried down. That their nefarious work was done by the
dictation and order of some one higher than they in the system
which runs this city and makes its government a reproach goes
without saying. The higher source of the corruption for which these
three convicts are suffering punishment may never be known by ab
solute proof, but this by no means disproves the fact. Such crimes
arc not committed and such risks are not taken by men of low de
gree as a voluntary matter and a spontaneous manifestation of crim
inal viciousness. They are committed in discharge of an obligation,
in obedience to an order and in pursuance of a plot, originating far
beyond the low instruments of the offense.
. It is the, certainty that this is so that nerves the reform move
ment to go on unabashed by the present' failure to find the real
source of the. corruption. Such source exists, and to finally eradicate
it is the duty that the Republican League has set for itself to dis
charge. Its duty will be done and its aim will be accomplished. ;

\u25a0 The majority of our. American women
lookVupon life , with, the simplicity of
children^ .to whom a fact is V fact; and
not a sign-post." They are wonderfully
unsophisticated- and Innocent, and often
what seems' In "their conduct like an
expression "of morbid curiosity. Is:noth
ing but a misdirected effort to get away
from ' the "humdrum routine of their
dally life. ; 7 .. : V ' \u25a0 "
â¢ Undoubtedly, some women went to the
trial .'of Johann" Hoch in Ihe same spirit
which: actuates those of '; their 'sisters
whoiread French ; novels", for the mere
sake of coming closeâ -but not too close

THERE has come to me across the
sea a published , editorial sugges
tion that I will explain, if I can,
why 'lt is; that women have shown so
much morbid curiosity concerning
Johann Hoch, the polygamlst and
uxorlcide, recently brought, to trial and
convicted f n ' Chicago for his crimes.
The undeserved slur .upon my sex
which \u25a0', the article contains persuades
me to pick up the glove.
Curiosity in regard to freaks of na
ture "Is not a peculiarly feminine trait.
The dime museum and the sideshow at
the circus have as many men as women
among their ' patrons, if not more. In
deed, maternal foresight teaches women
to glance away from visible abnormal
ity, and, when conf rented, with deform
ity, -'.to "look* with" the spiritual eye for
some beauty beneath It, which the
physical .eye cannot see. !
\ Deformity, of mind :t* t - soul Is le3s
likely to shock a' woman, however, un
less .It affects ; her personal destiny,
simply because she does not fully 'un
derstand it. r '."-. 1 ;-;> :T"
But to many other Women the Hoch
trial was nothing more than a free
show, which furnished more genuine
tnrills than vaudeville or melodrama.
Their anticipatory mood Is as innocuous
and insipid as this: "I have 'nothing to
do to-day. Where shall I go? I be
lieve I will visit the Hoch trial. I
wonder what that man looks like any
way, that he could' get so many women
to marry him?"
You see, in real life there are very
few men who : . have overpowering per
sonality. Yet literature is full of such,
and they are fascinating figures with
whom any woman might fall In love at
first sight. Now,, from the evidence of
his conquests' Johann Hoch must be
long In this category; surely there must
be something about him" which dis
tinguishes him from common men.'. Is
It so strange that a foolish woman may
reason, this, If she has never seen low
life, and knows nothing .whatever of
the forces that govern degenerate hu
man nature? \u25a0~ J *7? !%i .

If this were true it would, indicate that

MRS. EDDTS LAST '
\u25a0\u25a0â¢ WORD NOT SPOKEN
How this may be in Chicago is not stated, but Mr. Dalrymple
doubts if the people of that city will take the millions of securities
necessary to take over- the street railroad system. Of course, if they
would do so, every holder of such securities would have a direct
interest in a proper business operation of the property and would
make that interest felt at the polls. But this implies a political
division in the city. The investors jyvill be derided as "capitalists"
and their interests will be subjected to the same form of attack that
is now made upon the corporations that own the roads.
Those corporations have expressed their willingness to sell
their property to the city upon an agreed valuation and have im
posed no obstruction to municipal ownership. It is fortunate that
they have done so, for it enables an examination of the policy of
public ownership entirely free of the prejudice and passion that in
fluence it when the interests of the corporations are in issue. This
calm examination will probably lead to the adoption of The Call's
policy of making the plant carry itself and making the users pay for
it, relieving the public credit of any burden in the matter. The ad
vocates of municipal ownership as a business proposition are begin
ning to see the wisdom of this policy. But those who advocate such
ownership as a play in politics, or for the purpose of graft, desire
that the burden -shall be imposed upon the city's credit, to the end
that deficits may be put upon the taxpayers and be made easy of
concealment.
I We think that Mr. Dalrymple has made plain his preference for
the former policy. It remains to.be seea whether Chicago will
adopt the business or the political policy, for the matter is a part of
the programme in national politics, and will no doubt appear in the
Democratic platform of 1908. If Mr. Dalrymple's advice and con
clusions appear in a public report, it will be an interesting docu
ment.
RECENTLY The Call predicted that Mr. Dalrymple, the muni
cipal ownership expert from Glasgow, now in Chicago, would
find in this country an antagonism between theory and condi
tions. He has found it. He finds first that the distance tariffs on
street roads, enforced in Glasgow, and considered necessary to suc
cessful operation, will in American cities work hardship to the labor
ing people, who take the longest rides. This is a blow at the very
people in whose behalf public ownership is advocated, but it is not
the only adverse condition discovered by Mr. Dalrymple.
Glasgow had some experience, and it was not agreeable, with
the political organization and action of the city employes on street
railroads and other public trading enterprises. It became ntsprssary
to very sternly restrict the evil, since it /appeared to sacrifice the
public 'interest to that of a privileged class of public employes. Mr.
Dalrymple foresees that in Chicago this evil is likely to go on with
out sufficient check. He arrived in time to see the public school
teachers, who are organized in a union, inciting pupils to take
part in the present labor 'strike in that city, which they have done
to the injury of public property and in disobedience of the educa
tional statutes of the State. This seems to have admonished the
expert from Glasgow, and he sees that street railway employes will
use the power of organization and affiliation with other organiza
tions to decrease their service and increase their pay, regardless of
the interests of the city as an owner and operator of street rail-,
roads.
He expects that municipal ownership in Chicago would lead
to ceaseless political agitation, for the purpose of reversing the dis
tance schedule of fares as it is operated in Glasgow. As a majority
or a large minority of the patrons of street cars have the longest
rides, class spirit would cause a demand for the highest fares on
the shortest rides, on the theory that the short riders can better af
ford a high fare than the long riders. This would mean endless
contention and would interfere with a proper business administra
tion of the service.
It is not deemed feasible to prohibit the Chicago street car
employes forming a union and affiliating or confederating with
other bodies, because such prohibition would be carried into politics,
and members of the city government would surely be elected who
would repeal it, if it were adopted. So there would be political
agitation for higher wages, less service and lower fares, or fares
unequal in proportion to the mileage, and when these two policies
met there would be loss to the city and a deficit to be made up by
the taxpayers.
From* Mr. Dalrymple's statement it is plain that in Glasgow the
.street railroad is operated upon the plan suggested by The Call.
The railroad plant carries its own credit. Its rates are made such
as will pay the cost of operation and maintenance and provide a
sinking fund to pay the original cost of the plant and interest there
on. If there be any surplus it is paid into the general' fund. This
means that Glasgow operates her street railways as a business prop
osition entirely, and permits no interference by labor unions through
their influence in politics. Finally, in Glasgow the street railroad
bonds or securities are held by the people of the city. The laborers
invest in them in preference to depositing in savings banks, for the
interest is higher.

THE street car made a lons delay at
the depot. to take on board the fam
ily of the big, ' bearded foreigner.
There -was the man himself, radiant .with
delight; there was
his wife, the little
woman whose eyes
danced with Joy
every, 'time Bhe
looked at ~ the big
man; there were flve
children, more Inter
ested in the bags of
candy * that they
huggedV in their
clenched fists than
in either their father
or their mother.
The father tried to
coax the smallest
child to come to him
as they sat down,
but the little girl
snuggled down be
side her mother,
from which vantage
point she looked at
him shyly while he
cast rapturous
glances at bis wife.
They talked rapidly
and incessantly In
some foreign lan
guage, so absorbed
in each other that
they paid no heed to
the curious glances
of the other passen
gers.
The children gazed
with wondering,
puzzled eyes upon
the streets as if it
were all part ol
come strange pano
rama. The little
woman was a vivid
interrogation point.
The big man was an
encyclopedia of in
formation to her.
That they were a re
united family was
evident to r every one
who saw them. It "REUNITED"
was not. hard to
conjecture that the father had come to
this country a few years ago to prepare
a homa for the rest of them and that
now they had come to Join him. That he
and the little women were transported
with happiness at their reunion was plain
to all. . .
This seemed particularly in evidence to
a Bad-eyed woman who sat near thp door
of the car. She eyed them for some time
before she turned to her neighbor, a lit
tle woman whose face reflected the Joy
apparent on those of the happy family.
"Sad, isn't It?" she. queried in a first
meal-after-the-funeral voice.
"Sad!" exclaimed the other in amaze
ment.
"Yes, very sad. I
mean that American
families can not be
like that, instead of
bei n g separated."
She waited for the
woman she had,ad
dressed to say some
thing, but was \u25a0dis
appointed, and con
tinued plaintively as
she brushed away a
furtive tear, "My
husband and I are
separated. I have
not. r seen. , him for
years."..
The other woman
felt that it was In
cumbent upon her to
murmur,* "Is , that
so?",. .
"Yes; now, if I
should 'meet him
think how I . should
contrast the happi
ness of ; those poor
creatures with my
own wretchedness.
Life is very . hard.
Don't you think
so?"
There was no ajt
swer. The other
woman was .. watch
ing the big man re
store to the baby the
gumdrop that had
fallen to the floor.
The forlorn one con
tinued: "Divorce: is
an evil necessity.
Do you think that
those two will ever
secure a divorce?"
The woman whom
she . had addressed
looked at her in
amazement." \u25a0 I can

Newton J. Tharp, an architect, was in
troduced by J. W. Raphael and he unfold
ed a complete sketch of a covered Union
Square avenue. On < each side of 'the
street were walks seven feet wide. Every
thirty feet was a pillar, made of iron and
supporting a glass roof. These supporting
pillars solve the difficulty of a possible re
construction. With them any building
along the block can be completely re-;
modeled without injury to the archway.
At short spaces along the roof of the ar
cades are openings which are for use in
case of fire. At the meeting- Thursday
night Architect Tharp will present figures
to show the entire cost of a structure of
this kind.
The retail merchants and those of the
property owners who were in attendance
seemed very enthusiastic over the possi
bility of the artistic improvement. Most
of them had seen the shopping streets
of Paris, Berlin, Milan and other Euro-,
pean cities, where the covered shopping
avenues have been in vogue for- many
years.
A meeting of the property owners and
lease holders of the blocks bounded by
Geary, Stockton, Post and Kearny streets
and of Invited guests who are Interested
In civic improvement ' was held in the
Conservatory of the Palace Hotel last
night to discuss ways and means of beau
tifying Union Square avenue and turning
the alley into an attractive place for re
tail shoppers. Plans were talked over
and a sketch of a proposed arcade struc
ture was introduced, but because of- the
small number ol property owners present
no definite action was taken. On a motion
of E. S. Rothchild another meeting was
arranged for Thursday evening and an
attempt will then be made to carry the
matter to an issue.

School. ':':'\u25a0'. - v~ '.
The ordinance directing the City At
torney to b^gin condemnation proceedings
for block 129, set aside for a children's
playground at North Beach, was indefi
nitely postponed. The Utilities Committee
has selected block 151; bounded by Chest
nut, Powell, Lombard and Mason streets",
for the purpose,; and the City Attorney
will solicit offers for its sale to the city.
>'. The \ ordinance ordering the construc
tion, and equipment of \u25a0 the \u25a0. Washington
Grammar School- at a cost of $119,000 un
der the bond issue was finally - passed.
Fourteen votes would have been neces
sary to override the veto. The vote on
final passage was:
Ayesâ Booth, Brandenstein, Braunhart,
Comte, Connor , : D'Ancona, Eggers, Hocks,
McClellan, Payotâ lo.
Noesâ Boxton, Gallagher â 2.
Excused â Rea, Sanderson â 2. . \u25a0
PLAYGROUND IS SELECTED.
Gallagher argued that if the Board of
Supervisors had absolute control of city
funds it would t be responsible for the. de
falcaiions of !! ex-Tax' y ' Collector ", Smith:'
Rea suggested that the bill be sent .to
the ,City Attorney Ifor' an. opinion as to
its validity." This course -was followed,
after the Mayor's veto .was sustained, by
reintroducing the ordinance, . but amend-,
ing it so as to provide for' the appoint
ment of an "assistant" 'to the Board of
Supervisors Instead of an "inspector."
At this point Braunhart and the Mayor
engaged in a verbal tilt. The former, as
serted that the Mayor i had ' never been
present at the meetings of the committee,
which had not received the benefit of his
advice. The Mayor called Braunhart to
order, saying that he had overstepped the
time llmit^ pf , flve minutes allowed for
ipeaking^ ' .
ENGAGE IN VERBAL TILT.
The "Mayor said that he desired to. ex
pedite the construction of. the buildings,
but that even if he agreed to the ordi
nance some one would be sure to delay
the work by testing its legality. -Braun
hart held that the legality of the ordi
nance could be affirmed by the Board of
Works and that the Supervisors held the
keys to the city treasury. . , ' "
"Tlie' power to expend such large sums
of money as contemplated under the bond
issue," said BraunhaTt. "should not be
vested in three members of any municipal
body and withoutproper supervision. The
opinions of two City Attorneys held that,
the Supervisors alone ' shall ~ have control
of the expenditure, of municipal funds in
order to see that the money is honestly
expended."
Mayor . Schmitz flatly, declared the ordi
nance to be in : violation of the charter
provision and that all , that is
is to authorize the Board: of . Works
to proceed with the work.
Gallagher denies that the Board of
Works is the agent of the Board of Su
pervisors,'- claiming that; it ' is a separate
branch of the .municipality and is re
sponsible .for its own ' acts. He argued
that all the Supervisors had , to Jdo was
to provide the 'necessary funds j and that
they had no right to -interfere' with the
functions of the Board of Works.
D'Ancona stated that under the ordi
nance the- Board 'of .-\u25a0Works-;. would be the
agent of the Board of Supervisors in car
rying out the ..improvements and that it
simply prescribed the 'manner in which
the expenditures shall be made. *
The Board of Supervisors ; yesterday,
after a long wrangle, failed to override
the Mayor's veto of the ordinance pre
scribing the manner in which public build
ings under the bond issue, are to be con
structed, provlding'.for competitive plans
and for the appointment of Louis Stone
as supervising architect.
Boxtonsald he would- vote against the
ordinance because he understood that un
der its : terms -it would be several years
before the public buildings could \be_ built.
The contract for the teaming in the
Street Department was awarded to A.
B. Clute at $4 68 per day for each dou
ble team, wagon and driver and $3 40

dition that the minimum union wage of
$2 50 for the driver, of a. double team

Mr. Assam was 52 years of age and was
born in Svendborgr, Denmark. His father
was publisher of a paper at that place,
and in his office the boy became master
of the printing trade on graduation from
school life, where he won high honors.
After severing home ties, Mr. Assam
worked in Berlin. Paris, London and
other European cities for some years, and
about ISS3 came to the United States.
Some time was passed in New York on
daily papers and in other pursuits. Then
came a three years* stay In Denver,
after whirh Mr. Assam came to the coast.
In ISSS he took employment on The CaiÂ»,
and his ability was so manifest that he
was soon placed in the proofroom, where
he served for about ten years.
Of a retiring disposition and most gen
rrous in character, Mr. Assam's -inti
mates were not many, but those who
were admitted to friendship appreciated
his sterling qualities and will elncerely
repret his passing.
Mr. Assam was a man of artistic tem
perament and original views on life and
destiny. He was a student of Herbert
Spencer and of the best in history, liter
ature and science, a man of refined mind
and solendid faculties. Few men of for
eign birth have so well mastered the
penius and technifjue of English compo
sition and literature.

Axel L.. Assamâ to familiars "The
Count"â a member of San Francisco
Typographical Union No. 21. passed away
at the Balboa Sanitarium in this city
Sunday, June 11, after suffering for some
months from locomotor ataxia.
The symptoms of the disease manifest
ed themselves four years ago, and de
ceased went to the country in the hope
that an outdoor life would restore him to
health. That hope was not realized,
however, and in December last he re
turned to the city to seek the assistance
that medical skill could give. But the er
forts in his behalf were in vain.

"Ever since boyhood I have been
efepeciaUy fond of meats, and I am con-
vinced I ate too rapidly, and failed to
mastlcte my . food properly. .
"The result was that I found myself.
a few years ago, afflicted with aliments
of the stomach and kidneys, which in-
terfered seriously with my business.
"At last I took the advice of friends
and began to eat Grape-Nuts instead of
the heavy meats, eta, that had consti-
tuted my former diet. \u25a0_ Â»
"I found that I. was at once benefited
by the change, that I was soon relieved
from thÂ« heartburn and" the indigestion
that used to follow my meals; that the
pains, in my back from my kidney 'af-
fection had ceased, showing that those
organs had been healed, and that my
nerves, which used to.be unsteady, and
my brain, which was slow and lethar-
jric from a heavy diet of meats and
greasy foods, had, not in a moment,
but gradually and none the less surely,
been restored to normal efficiency. Now
every nerve Is steady and my ; brain
and thinking faculties are quicker and
more acute than for. years past.
"After my old syle breakfasts I used
to suffer during the forenoon from a
feeling of weakness which ' hindered
me seriously in my work, but since I
have begun to use Grape-Nuts *f ood I
can work till dinner time with all ease
and comfort." Name' given by Postum

Two prizefights varied, for the men
folk, the monotony of the homeward
voyage. In one of the fights Cincinnati
Jim Ryan, once a professional pugilist
and now a private in the Twenty-third
Infantry, was knocked out in the fifth
round of what was to have been a
twenty-round go by Willy Duffy. "The
Pride of the Thomas." It was Edward
Tate, a sailor on the Thomas, who got
the decision in the other scrap. His
opponent was Trooper Madder of the
Twelfth Cavalry. Madder, before the
fight, said he was a brother of Benny
Yanger. The Tate-Madder contest was
one of the liveliest goes ever witnessed
on the Thomas. There was something
doing all the time. Three referees went
out under stray swings and the man
who awarded the decision to Tate nar
rowly escaped a misplaced uppercut
just as the gong sounded "time's up" In
the last round. Four times the con
testants dived over the ropes and be
fore the finish of the third round the
ringside seats were vacant and the men
in the corners had secured clubs for
their own protection.
Among the passengers was Edwin
Emerson, a free lance war correspond
ent who left Japan at the request of
the Japanese authorities. Emerson was
in Port Arthur during the siege. With
a French correspondent he left that
stronghold before its fall and later, in
Manchuria, fell into the hands of the
Japanese. He was detained for two
months at Sasebo. Minister Grlscom,
who is said to be a relative of Emerson,
arranged for his transportation home
on the Thomas.
The Thomas brought from the Philip
pines 1415 passengers. Of these 193
were in the first cabin. The others in
cluded 210 enlisted men of the Twelfth
Cavalry, 536 of the Twenty-third
Infantry, ITS casuals, .orty-nine United
States marines, ten bluejackets and
twenty-one prisoners.
Judging by her appearance it was
hard to believe that the Thomas had
Just arrived from a long voyage and
that nearly 1500 people had been living
on board her. Outside and inside she
was clean as a newly commissioned
yacht, and in Major Devol's smile of
satisfaction after he had completed his
usual thorough inspection could be read
a glowing testimonial to the good man
agement and faithful exertions of Cap
\u25a0 tain Lynam and his officers.
For "the speed of the Thomas much
credit is given to First Assistant Engi
neer Foley, who for months has
watched and cared for the trooper's
engines and who has inspired the engi
neer officers and others under him with'
a good deal of his own enthusiasm.
On the outward voyage the Thomas
was fox five 'days on tlie edge of a great
typhoon. The sky darkened at noon
on April 23 and by 3:30 p. m. of the
24th rain was falling as it can come
\u25a0 down only in the tropics. An observa
tion was taken on Tuesday, April 23,
â¢ and that was the last seen of sun, moon
or stars until the following. Sunday at
3 0 a. m., when the weather cleared.
During the greater part of this time the
Thomas was hove to. She drifted about
350 miles off her course and when the
weather cleared the transport was off
Sau Miguel Bay, island of Luzon. An
other day of darkness and drifting and
Uncle Sam's great steamship, which ar
rived here yesterday looking so stauch
and proud, would have been on the
rocky shores of Luzon.
The army transport Thomas. Captain
Lynam, surprised the local marine
world in general and the quartermas
ter's department of the army in par
ticular by her appearance off the Pre
sidio early yesterday morning. It was
\u25a0 known that she was homeward bound
and was making a direct run from
Nagasaki,- but not until Thursday did
Major Devol expect to see the troop
ship. She came from Nagasaki in 16
days 6 hours, the smartest run ever
made by one of L'ncle Sam's troop
ships.

and Jones are the largest stockholders.
In the complaint it is alleged that

property owned by the company and
that Its destruction was malicious and
wanton: Raun claims to own the prop

VALLEJO. June 12.â Navy officials on
Mare Island laugh at the dispatches from
Washington, published, in a San Fran
cisco paper Sunday morning, . stating that
the collier Ontario, ordered built at the
Mare Island Navy Yard by the last Con
gress, may not be built here at all. They
say that while it is true the estimates
for the construction of the colliers were
revised, owing to the determination of
the Navy â¢ Department to increase the
speed of the vessel, and that the contest
of Congress will have to be obtained be
fore actual construction can be com
menced, the ship will be built here.
Naval Constructor Holden E. Evans of
Mare Island says that ten months will be
required to build the ways and the big
traveling crane needed before construc
tion work can be commenced, and that
long before that time elapses Congress,
will have made the necessary appropria
tions. '"'.* : ."--: ';\u25a0," '. ". 7

An -Interesting case : that ' illustrates, -th*)
quick effects oi Electro-Chemistry in serious \u25a0
affections " of the <UgeÂ«tlvÂ«" organs-, is. that, of :
Mrs. Julia A. Mitchell, . living at Â«58 : Fifth ;
street; Oakland. Mrs. Mitchell : had suffered
more cr lew for eighteen years. In thÂ«. last
year she had gotten so bad that she was com-
uelled to take morphine all the time to relieve
her of a killing pain in the region of the
liver and stomach. This pain : finally got so
bad that morphine i would - not â¢ stop \u25a0 Jit;- and- in !
this serious condition she happily- heard of \u25a0
the Electro-Chemic treatment â¢and, made, ar-
rangtment* to take the Electrb-Chenxfc; course. .
There Â»8 no doubt in the. world but:- that" Mrs. :
Mitchrll suffered from cancer. -.rAftef.;: taking:
nyÂ« treatments Mr*. Mitchell began, to .Improve â¢
rapidly. She took -no more. monJhlne. *She:
did net need it.- The pains -.werje s.p T ;much ,
better that' the. could stand ' them and \u25a0in a J
ebort time they entirely disappiarcd.' : : She t
Is now thoroughly cured and is attending to ,
her household duties with no trouble at ali. * :
Such cures, as these, are - causing people' to
think. Many who have . been, drugging for,
years without relief are . throwing, away . tKelr
medicines and are taking Electro-Chemistry :
and are getting, well quickly at a small ~ ex-
pense and without. th* least pain or-lnconveni-'
encÂ« ct *ny kind. The Electro-Chemic epe-;
ciallsu are proud of their success. They like.
to have persons Interested to come and .in-;
vÂ»stisrate these remarkable cures which' haye 1
been reported from time to time in the news-
papers for the past .four years. To the sick,
and afflicted no matter what : their troublu
may be. a cordial- invitation -is extended -to
them to come to the Electro-Chemie -Institute,'

had fully, quickly cured,' earnestly urged me
to take his treatmejii. positively declaring
he had personally witnessed his wonderful,
instant success with many of his own total-
ly DEAF friends. At Rexradio' s FIBST
treatment of 3 seconds I closed my good ear
and a a long distance clearly heard every
word spoken in a WHISPER, which, after
nearly a 'year, I can STILL DO. I have also
SEEN him .obtain' exactly similar, instant,
marvelous results with many other DEAF
persons. Ask. him for my NAME."

PRESIDIO TERRACE.
Read what promlnenr
' . â¢ \u25a0 Citizens say about it.
W. H. Crocker: Â» .'
"I feel a great Interest in what you are do-
ing for the improvement of .'Presidio Terrace,'
so beautifully located next to the Presidio res-
ervation. I have noticed that such plans have
been followed In other cities, where they have
proved universally popular and successful, add-
ing to the beauty of the residence portion of
such cities. The scheme is a splendid one, and
its success is assured."-
" \u25a0 James D. Phelan:. . '.
"I note with much satisfaction that you
have subdivided Presidio Terrace in a manner
which recalls the beautiful park residences of
other and more progressive cities whose exam-
ples we may well follow. The scheme will
promote nelghborliness based on common Inter-
ests, and: at the same time the grouping of
the houses within the : enclosure should insure
privacy, and protection. The plan seems ideal."
"'A.' Sbarboro: Â£-* â¢ -
"I congratulate you upon the splendid scheme
-for residence | plots as shown by the plan of
Presidio Terrace. I have seen similar places in
Europe , and In some cities of the Eastern
States, but 1 believe that Presidio Terrace will
surpass them all. The location being adjacent
to the Presidio, families . with their children
can stroll at their pleasure and enjoy the beau-
tiful view of the bay and ocean. ~ The sunny-
exposure of the tract cannot be excelled. Ac-
cept my heartiest congratulations for the beau-
tiful and praiseworthy enterprise^ which \u25a0is
sure to meet with great favor."

siderably Increased \u25a0 over : that of.' last v. year. ]
Many traders considered that' the "bright pros

NETv" YORK, Juns 12. â The stock market
to-day aid not fulfill tis promise held out by
Saturday's short market of a. revived market
t-cd higher prices fcr stocks. The selling attract
ed by Saturday's sharp rise In prices proved
too much for the limited demand to absorb.
The market yielded decisively and the first
selling was followed by additional burdens
from the aaxne souro*. As the day progressed the
pressure relaxed and price* made come slow
recoveries. In a few stocks there was special
strength which offered a leadership for the
rally. Tbe later dealings showed a marked
shrinkage Is volume from those in the first
hour while the accumulated selling orders were
being executed. The turn in the temper of
the market had no positive news developments
to account for it. The fact was Quickly dem
onstrated, however, that the market was still
strictly in professional hands. The movement
of Saturday weakened the technical position
by the reduction of the short Interest by driv
ing to cover Boms of the shorts who were
alarmed by the evidence of strength in the
market- An element of potential strength was
Thus reduced. At the came time the quiet ex
tension of the long Interest on * the part of
professionals Increased the weight on the mar
ket when the Instability of prices was per
ceived. The holidays were general abroad, and
deprived the market of one possible source of
demand which might have been stimulated' by
the developments of peace prospects. This in
fluence was modified by professed doubts from
some source* of the substantial basis for the
hopes cf peace. This feeling was the result of
opinion rather than of any actual occurrence
that could be pointed to as changing the con
ditions lcr.g in existence.
The Government crop report which appeared
Saturday afternoon proved to be the source of
*uch varying Interpretations as are common in
the foreign markets at the critical period of
the making of crops. Notwithstanding the de
cline In condition of winter wheat, the dimen
sions cf the total crop indicated a hopeful
spirit. This -was modified by the making of
runr.ises of possible deteriorating since the
date cf the" Government's estimates. Further
reductions were reported in pig iron prices,
but the iron and steel stocks were relatively
firm all day and developed -positive strength in
the later 4eaUAÂ£rs. The epeciol pressure agrainst
.Amalgamated- Copper first connected in the"
Blinds of professional operators with a c'am
r-aign having its source in Boston. The Met
ropolitan stocks owed their strength to
the aspect of affairs of the Equitable
Life Assurance Society. Discussion of that
subject was less optimistic than en Saturday
end it was urged that the forthcoming report
of the State Superintendent of Insurance must
V,* awaiu-d to form a definite Judgment on the
mv- plan. There vres much conjecture also
tr.uchlci? the identity of the syndicate to
â¢which the Equitable stocks had been convert
t-i. The postponement of the call for the re
turn cf Government deposits from July 1 "to
Ju!y 15 promised relief from one possible em
barrassment of the money market In connec
tion, with that of the yearly settlements. The
rone of the weekly comments on traffic . of.
rÂ«.Hroad officials showed some conservatism. .
ThÂ» effort toward recovery was continued.
through the latter part of the day, but the
movement was somewhat uncertain' and the
market closed unsteady.
Bonds were irregnlar. Total sales. par
vaJue. $4,310,000. United States. S* registered,
advanced 14 on call.

"coldness" had existedâ for some time,
the cause of which it was hardly neces
sary, to recount, as it had no direct bear
ing: on the case there under adjudication.
Therefore she was considerably surprised
riy the call and somewhat puzzled to ac
couiit for it until Pearl's demeanor con
veyed enlightenment. The young lady's
manner clearly indicated pride in her
possession of Mr. Kelly and desire to in
timate that more than one feminine mem
ber of the Lee family could find a
worthy member of the opposite sex to
Itad her to the hymeneal altar. Mrs.
Cornwall, however, respected her posi
tion as hostess too much to exhibit an
noyance at the silly "showing off," and
not until her sister "gave her a piece of
h^-r mind," "called her every name in the
calendar" and "abused her up hill and
down dale." did she summon police aid
to preserve her rights as a chatelaine.
Gocdr.ess knows she would be as glad
as ar.y one else to see Pearl settle down
in matrimony' and she would be the last
person en earth to "put a spoke in her
< Pearl's) wheel," but she could not stand
everything. No. she did not want any
body sent to Jail, but she would like to
have her home protected from recurrence
of the complained of invasion.

Amelia Harrlngtoa Loin Half Interest
In 910,000 Through Failure to Intro
duce Certain Technical Evidence.
' The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that Amelia Harrington was not en
titled-to any' part of the 910.000 estate
left by John P. Harrington. She was
married ,to the decedent forty years
ago in Michigan. He came West and
engaged in mining, sending back money
at .Irregular intervals for her support.
\Atter-'a' time the remittances ceased
and, concluding that, he was dead, she
married a man named \u25a0 Carley.
Two weeks after her wedding she
separated from Carley on discovering:
that Harrington still lived. When the
latter i died she . sougrht t0 ... secure a
widow's share of : the estate. At the
first. trial she neglected to Introduce as
evidence the law of Michigan which
provides that a marriage such as hers
is void. Judgment was given against
her. The law of this State provides
that such a marriage Is "voidable," but
not void.
Mrs. Harrington instituted a aecond
action, presenting the necessary evi
dence.' but it was held in the Superior
Court that the first decision was a bar
to another action -and' the Supreme
Court sustains that view.

other Improvements, forty acres being
pTowed and the other "forty 'acres covered
with fruit trees and vines, all of the value
of J4OCO and free from encumbrance.
Whltcomb .was represented <as a "great
country hayseed" Just arrived, and had
no idea of the value of a lodging-house.
He would "kick himself to death" for
sell Ins a valuable ranch for a "lot of old
Junk." He would be willing to exchange
his .ranch for the lodging-house at 1122
Market street, and Mrs. Jellnek -'was
urged to close the deal at once, as Whit
