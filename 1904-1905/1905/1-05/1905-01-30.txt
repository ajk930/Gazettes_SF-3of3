â LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29.âThe first
overt act in the threatened war be

Cattlemen taking the initiative. Blood

the clash was received to-day at the

For the first time in years at this

fallen in the valley have started the

" he has formed, will convert 150 acres of
the property into one of the finest

Huntington will bund an electric line

Saturday a large band of sheep was

who had not received the warning. A
posse of cattlemen was formed and
they rode to where the sheepmen had

as they were outnumbered three to one

They were given six hours in which

LOSS FROM OMAHA FIRE
MORE THAN HALF-MILLION
Water Freezes on the Buildings,
Making Them Look Like Huge
Ice Castles. -
OMAHA, Jan. 29.âThe fire which
started last night in the wholesale
district was the most extensive in the
history of Omaha. The total loss will
exceed half a million dollars. The
flames continued to menace adjoining
buildings until after 4 o'clock this
morning. During all of to-day a num
ber of streams were kept pouring on
the ruins. With zero temperature
the water was quickly frozen and to
night the walls of the burned build
ings resemble huge ice castles.
Half a block was burned out. The
immense buildings contained great
jobbing stocks, which is responsible
for the enormous loss. The buildings
themselves were valued at about
$200,000, and were owned respec
tively by the Mercer and Millard es
tates.
The principal losses are as follows:
S. D. Mercer, on building, $125,000;
E. P. Kirkendall, shoe company, on
stock, $125,000; M. E. Smith & Co.,
on stock, $150,000.

GENERAL. KUR-KTS HEAD
QUARTERS, Jan. 29.âThe Russian
attempt to turn the Japanese left has
resulte* in a complete failure. The
Russians chose the worst weather of
the season, depending:, perhaps, upon
their familiarity with a snowy country
to aid them in their operations. Their
artillery attacks on the Japanese per
manent line were, it is thought, a dem
onstration to prevent the withdrawal of
forces for the purpose of reinforcing
the Japanese left.
AH yesterday afternoon and into the
night an artillery duel was waged
across the Shakhe River. There was
much heavy artillery rifle firing from
positions where the intrenchments are
closest.
It has been quiet to-day, except on
the left. The weather is much milder.

tillery fire and a general bombardment
along the whole front continued all
day yesterday and was resumed at
daylight this morning.
The boml ~rdment, beginning at
dawn this morning on the extreme left,
rapidly spread along the whole front
of Oku's army. It was kept up fiercely
all day and it was the strongest artil
lery fire since the battle of the Shakhe
River. Salvos are being fired continu
ously. There is also considerable mus
ketry firing. The Japanese are reply
ing infrequently and are saving their
fire, awaiting an attack. There is a
possibility that the entire line will be
engaged soon.
HEADQUARTERS GENERAL
OKU'S ARMY, Friday. Jan. 27.âThe
Russians are massing on General Oku's
left and ;.re evidently preparing for
battle. It is believed they will attempt
to turn the left and make what is re
garded as a fruitless attack on account
of domestic trouble in Russia. There
has been a constant and very heavy
fire, principally artillery, the past two
days. It Is believed that the Russians
have been heavily reinforced.
The battle, if it occur, will engage
nearly 1,000,000 men. The weather is
very cold and the ground is covered
with snow.

General Staff, under date of Janu

"On January 26 the enemy began
to concentrate in considerable force
near Sandepas, Intending to take the
offensive. On January 27 our column
on the extreme left took the offensive
against the villages of Sumapu and
Paotsia, south of Sandepas, which
were occupied by the enemy. During
the whole of January 27 an obstinate
fight was going on here and after
midnight we took Sumapu.
"On January 26 another column ad
vancing upon Sandepas occupied a
great part of that fortified village; but
coming upon a strong redoubt with a
triple row of artificial obstacles which
had been scarcely damaged by our
fire, and which were armed with field
artillery and quick-firers, and seeing
the impossibility of carrying the re
doubt without a preliminary bom
bardment, our troops left Sandepas,
which had been set on Are, it being
impossible to remain there without
risking defeat.
"On January 27 and 28 Sandepas
and its redoubt were heavily bom
barded, while our extreme left column
engaged the enemy near Sumapu and
Paotsia. Details have not been re
ceived.
"On January 26 and 27 our cavalry
operating six miles south of Sandepas
attacked and defeated a Japanese
company and took prisoners. Alto

swords, inflicting severe cuts across his
face and lower lip. Dripping with
blood, Muoukain was conveyed to the

"British Consul General Murray had
a narrow escape from being similarly

GRAND DUKE SERGIUS
RUSSIA'S REAL RULER
DICTATES CZAR'S POLICY
Government Given Over to Fattier
land's Hated "Evil Genius."
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 80.âEvi
dence is accumulating that Emperor
Nicholas, throughout the present
crisis, has acted largely upon the ad
vice of Grand Duke Sergius, who is
the most reactionary member of the
imperial family and the head of what \
is denominated the war party and
v horn the Liberals stigmatize as Rus
sia's evil genius.
With .the first appearance of Father
Gopon in the movement, Sergius urged
the necessity of putting down the
demonstrations in the most energetic
manner. Since Sunday last his hand
is considered to have been visible in
the appointment of General Trepoff to
the ; .Governor Generalship of St.
Petersburg, with the exceptional
powers conferred upon him.
Grand Duke Sergius is known to be
responsible for the charges placarded
by Deputy Chief of Police Roudneff of ]
Moscow, whioii is causing Foreign j
Minister Lamsdorff embarrassment, |
and now, it is believed, he is about to
prevail in the matter of naming as
Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky's successor
in the Ministry of the Interior the for
mer Governor General of Moscow,
Bculigan, who, like his patron, is an
extreme reactionary. ,
The press is informed from a high
â ource that Grand Duke Sergius, more
than Witte, is responsible for the
elimination from the imperial mani
festo of Minister Sviatopolk-Mirsky's
plan for an elected Zemstvoist Council
of the empire. Against Sergius* in
fluence the Ministers at present are
apparently powerless. Sergius reigns
in the little palace inside the strong
ramparts of the Kremlin fortress in
Moscow, whence he dispatches daily a
courier to Tsarskoe-Selo.
Arrests continue. Among the per
sons seized last night and conveyed to
the St. Peter and St. Paul fortress
were Yakonbovich, the poet, who
served a term in exile in ISB6 for con
nection with the revolutionaries; Mme.
Pimenoff, an aged writer, and her
daughter.
â¢ Father Gopon, it has now been defi
nitely established, escaped through
Finland and was conveyed across the
gulf to Sweden by sympathetic friends.
At present he is supposed to be in
Stockholm. A story has been started,
and is attributed to the police, that
Gopon is a Jew.
A marshal of the nobility from one
of the central provinces has expressed
the opinion to the press that the Gov
ernment could not extricate itself from
the present situation without very
substantial concessions.
The situation In Poland ia increas
ingly threatening, especially in War
saw and Lodz. At the latter place it
is reported that 10,000 men are out on
strike. There are prospects of exten
sion of the strikes in Odessa and other
manufacturing cities of Southern
Russia, where the workmen are better
organized. Meanwhile practically all
.classes expect renewed terror.
CHURCH REBUKES RIOTERS.
Holy Synod Denounces Gopon as a
Criminal Priest.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 29.âThe
Holy Synod has addressed the follow
ing circular to the orthodox, with ref
erence to recent events:
"At the moment when all should
have stood united for the protection
.of the fatherland, strikes broke out in
the capital and other towns, incited by
enemies at home and abroad, and
thousands of the orthodox gave up
work, determined forcibly to obtain
rights which they alleged had been
trampled under foot. Many peaceful
citizens were deprived of bread and
many of their comrades uselessly for
feited their lives. Those who led them
astray had in their midst a criminal
priest, who impudently disdained his
sacred vow and is now before the ec
clesiastical court. He was not ashamed
to give into the hands of the work
men he had deceived the holy cross
and pictures, and the church banners
which he had forcibly taken from a
chapel, in order, under the protection
tof the sacred relics so dear to the
faithful to lead men to disturbances
and some even to death.
. . "The most grievous fact is that the
disturbances were caused and brought
on by Russian enemies and that consid
erable sums of money were received
'to create civil war and, by drawing
men from their work, to prevent.the
due dispatch of land and sea forces to
the Far East and the supplying of the
active army with all Ub needs. Rus
sia's enemies are striving to shake
down her pillars of orthodoxy and
autocracy, without which Russia
would come to ruin.
'"What a grief it is that erthodox
people should rise against the lawful
power and against one another while
their brothers are fighting in the Far
East and the Emperor and Empress
are endeavoring to alleviate the suf
ferings of the wounded."
The circular concludes by adjuring

STORM IS CZAR'S ALLY.
Blizzard Keeps tlie Workingmen of
Mo.Â«cow Indoors.
MOSCOW, Jan. 29âThe strike is con
sidered to be practically ended. A bliz
zard has rendered excellent service to
the authorities in keeping the people
indoors, and there was not the slightest
disorder to-day. The authorities, how
ever, had taken exceptional precau
tions to avoid the assemblage of
crowds. Even the Sunday markets
were closed. Strong pickets were post
ed throughout the city, inside the fac
tories and outside. There are about
30,000 troops in the city. â¢
It is reported that' the police last
night sent 1000 of the most-obstreperous
strikers back to the Villages.

Treaty of Younghusband
With Tibet Not in Accord
With His Instructions
. Â»
BLUE BOOK EEVELATION
Indemnity Item of the Con
vention Eegarded as Exor
bitant by King's Ministry
LONDON, Jan. 29.âA voluminous
blue book Issued on Tibetan affairs has
unusual interest as revealing strong
friction between the Government and
Colonel Younghusband concerning -the
indemnity which was fixed at $3,750,000,
payable in seventy-five annual install
ments, and which would have resulted
in British occupation of the Chumbl
valley for seventy-five years.
Brodrick, Secretary of State for In
dia, on September 13 telegraphed sug
gesting a reduction to $1,250,000. Col
onel Younghusband's response to this
and other Government protests strongly
deprecated alteration of the treaty as
tending to defeat the object of the mis
sion. Finally, a lengthy correspondence
between Secretary Brodrick and Lord
Curzon, the Viceroy of India, ended in
the Government accepting the situation
as regards the $3,750,000 indemnity, but
refusing to permit of the occupation
of the Chumbi valley beyond three
years. The Government protested that
Colonel Younghusband had framed the
convention in defiance of express in
structions, the Government's policy be
ing to avoid interference in the national
affairs of Tibet, and stipulated that
should the Tibetans break the treaty
It would be necessary to reconsider the
Government's policy.
The blue book shows that Foreign
Minister Lansdov.ne last spring gave
Russia an emphatic assurance that so
long as no other power endeavored to
intervene in the affairs of Tibet the
British Government would neither at
tempt to annex, establish a protector
ate or in any way control Its internal
administration. It further appears
that after the mission returned the
Indian Government as an "act of
grace" reduced the indemnity to
$1,250,000.

St. Petersburg Is Disappointed
Learns of the Re

Kuropatkin.
' ââ¦ â'â-
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 30.âIn
stead of confirmation of Saturday
night's report that General Kuropat
kin had broken through the Japanese
left, there came Lieutenant General
Sakharoff's official admission to-day
that the Russians had been compelled
to retire from Sandepas on account of
their inability to carry a redoubt.
It is also significant that dispatches
from Russian correspondents at the
front have again suddenly ceased,
which is regarded as an indication of
the failure of the operation and
strengthens the first impression that
it was a demonstration undertaken to
distract the people at home from the
present situation. â 
Nemirovieh Danchenko, the war
correspondent, who. has Just arrived
from the front, said to-day:
"I do not regard the present of
fensive measure as likely to be pro
longed. I believe General Kuropatkin
does not contemplate a decisive move
ment before a couple of months. The
weather conditions till then will be un
favdtakble. General Kuropatkin now
is merely preparing the way and
sharpening his troops which have re
cently arrived."

Prince Kilkoff says he does not ex
pect that the strike in the railroad
shops will continue, but should it do
so he may have to order cars and

UNION LEADER
ACCUSES TRUST
Donnelly Says an Agent
of the Beef Barons
Offered Him Large Bribe
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Jan. 2Â».âReports circu
lated in packing centers throughout the
country that Michael Donnelly, presi
dent of the Amalgamated Meat Cut
ters' and Butcher "Workmen, had grown
rich as a result of the recent strike
brought out a hot reply to-day from
the leader of the butchers.
In a statement which he issued Don
nelly says he is ready to prove that
a certain packing company attempted
to bribe him with the offer of a large
sum of money and a monthly salary
and that the offer was indignantly
spurned. He further charges the pack
ers with having broken the letter and
spirit of the agreement entered into
when the strike of last summer was
declared off and says paid agents of
the packers are industriously circulat
ing the reports that he is now building
a fine residence on money received for
calling off the strike.
These reports, Donnelly declares, are
being issued for the purpose of keep
ing the men divided, so that the or
ganization cannot again be built up,
and he challenges any man to prove
that he ever received a dollar that he
did not honestly earn.

Tell of Frantic Efforts
NEW YORK, Jan. 29.âShut in the
â team room of a Russian bathhouse in
Hester street, two young men were
scalded to death before their plight
was discovered by the attendants. Evi
dence that both had made frenzied ef
forts to attract attention was afforded
by cuts and bruises on the bodies and
by blood-stained scratches In the plas-

The victims were Abraham Paster
nak and Peter Roos, tailors.
Abraham Stern, the proprietor of the

the police gathered that Roos and Pas
ternak entered the bath last night and,
after being conducted into the steam
room, were left there and evidently for
gotten until their bodies were found
to-day. There was a gas Jet in the
room, but it was unlighted, and in the

Forty-Five Minutes Flight

executing all sorts of maneuvers with
the big aerial craft,. returning finally
and landing within the inclosure of
the baseball grounds whence he started.
The weather was perfect for the ex
periment, with Just the faintest sus
picion of a southwest breeze blowing.
Immense throngs gathered at the ball
park, the Chutes and on the streets to
watch the flight. At 3:25 o'clock the
airship rose gracefully from its anchor
age in the ball park and soared away
to the northeast for half a mile,
gradually rising as it gathered speed*
When about seven hundred feet above
ground Knabenshue began his maneu
vers.
Captain Baldwin had fitted the
Arrow with a new and more power
ful motor and to-day this important
part of the mechanism worked to per
fection. The new motor apparently
made the big cigar-shaped balloon
much easier to handle. It responded
readily to every turn of the steering
gear and was driven in every direction
at sharp angles as the aeronaut di
rected. At no time did the ship rise
to a height of 1500 feet, and the ma
nipulation of the mechanism of the
airship by the operator was plainly
visible to the spectators on the ground
below.
Knabenshue brought the Arrow back
to the original starting point. The big
crowd broke into cheers as Knaben
shue alighted from the airship.

Novel Contest for a Scotch Earfdom
THE GIFTED AUTHOR AND TRAV3LEK AND THE SCOTCH MAGISTRATE OF
MEDIOCRE ABILITY WHO WILL SHORTLY COMMENCE BEFORE THE
ENGLISH PARLIAMENT A NOVEL BATTLE FOR A SCOTCH EARLDOM.
SaeciaJ Disnatch to The Cail.
LONDON, Jan. 29.âIn the House of
Lords the unique legal contest for a
long dormant Scotch earldom will soon
be started between a man who regards
a peerage as the greatest honor on
earth to which a commoner can aspire,
and another man w ho cares not a but
ton for it and is only anxious to- keep
the other fellow from getting it. K.
Barclay-Allardice, who heretofore had
done nothing to call attention to him
self beyond filling the role of a small
country squire and getting himself sev
eral times elected Mayor of the little
Cornish town ol" Lostwithiel, is the man
who wants the title of "Lord" so badly.
Cy virtue of his office he is entitled to
wear a gorgeous scarlet robe, and sport
a big gold chain around ins neck, and
have a man with a mace strut before
liiin at local civic functions. All this
makes him a personage of great im
portance in Lostwithiel, but it confers
no dignity upon him beyond the con
fines of the town and has not even suf
ficed to gain him a mention' in "Who's
Who." Wherefore he yearns exceed
ingly for the far reaching distinctions
which a coronet would bring him.
Robert Cunninghame-Graham, who
has made his mark as a brilliant writ
er, modern knight-errant, world wan
derer and adventurer, is the claimant
v ho is indifferent to the title. It could
confer no distinction on him. although
he would be a decided acquisition to
that prosaic body of hereditary legis
lators who sit in the upper house. It
was only after the Cornish Squire had
put forward his claim that Cunning
hame-Graham entered the lists against
him. Some other claimants have since
appeared, one of whom, George Mar
shall, lives somewhere In America, but
they don't count.
The history of the earldom in dis
pute, that of Menteith, is a romantic
'rne, and dates back several hundred
years. King Robert II of Scotland was
twice married, and made David, the
' Idest son by his second wife, Earl of
strathearn. David's eldest son duly
inherited the title and with it much
of the fiery spirit of his grandfather.
He had the temerity to boast openly
that his blood was redder than the
King s. The King was James I of
Scotland, and it tojiched him on a raw
spot, owing to the fact that the legi
timacy of his own line, the issue of
King Rupert II's first mr.rriage, was
open to dispute. In those strenuous
days monarchs could take away as wqfl
as confer titles and he declared the
â¢â¢arldc-m of Strathearn forfeited. By
way cf compensation he created his
i ruculent and impolite kinsman Earl of
Menteith.
LOANED KING MONEY.
This earldom went on to the seventh
of the name who, unfortunate like his
forerunners in arousing the hostility of
the crown, was forbidden by Charles I,
without any legal formality, to use-the
title of Menteith and ordered to use
that of Earl of Airth. Perhaps the roy
al displeasure may be accounted for by
the fact that this seventh Earl of
Menteith was so unwise as to lend his
Majesty several thousand pounds and
showed still greater Imprudence by re
minding him of the debt and express
ing surprise that it had not been re
paid.
The ground on which Barclay-Al
lardice bases his claim to the title is
the contention that the eldest sister
of the last Earl of Menteith carried it
with her and that she married into the
Barclay-Allardice family. It is alleged
by the other side that it was the
younger sister who made this marriage.
All that Is established beyond dispute
is that one sister married Sir William
Graham of Gartmore and another a
Barclay-Allardice. Whatever may be
the ultimate decision as to the matri
monial alliances of these two sisters,
Cunninghame-Graham makes a "still
stronger claim to the title as heir male
in rignt of descent from Sir John Gra
ham of Killbryde, secoad son of the
first Earl of Menteith. The Grahams
had a checkered career. One died l n
sane and another greatly impoverished
and known as the "Beggar Earl" died
in a ditch at Bonhill and was buried
by charitable folk. The case will mean
much raking up of musty records and
rich pickings for peerage lawyers.
Cunninghame-Graham is one of the
most picturesque and interesting per
sonalities in the United Kingdom. He
is a handsome, alert, distinguished
looking man, with crisp upstanding
gray hair and a vandyke beard.
Though during the last six years that
he sat in Parliament he was one of
the most scholariv members who ever
enlivened the dreary atmosphere of
the House of Commons, he glories
more in having been hailed as "com
rade" in the stormy days of his social
istic youth by blacksmiths, miners
and artisans than in all the heritage
of learning and pure Scots blood
which has come down to him from
the days of his royal ancestor.
OUT OF PARLIAMENT.
He dropped out of Parliament in
1892. To one so fond of activity and
adventure life there seemed dull and
tedious and* most of its oratory gas
eous and Ineffective. Also he found
it expensive. He was the most vic
timized man in the Commons. He
never could resist a tale of woe.
Shoals of people of extreme opinions
who had had the misfortune to lose
their Jobs or their purses or had
other reasons for desiring small tem
porary loans sought him out at St.
Stephens and few of them went away
empty handed.
Deeply did they deplore his depar
ture from the halls of legislation for
the wild regions of the earth where
applicants for "backsheesh" are less
numerous and persistent. But liter
ature has been a great gainer there
by. His books of travel and adventure
are mbst delightful reading and their
style is classic.
He is a "throw back." From some
remote ancestor who flourished long
prior to the days of Bruce has come
down to him a strong dislike for the
humdrum monotony of civilization. A
short spell of it suffices to start him
wandering again. He has been almost
everywhere, and in perils oft, but has
always contrived to escape. In Mo
rocco, for wanting to know too much,
he was once imprisoned in one of the
castles of the wild tribesmen, but by
the aid of friends in Tangier he con
triveo to give them the slip. He has
ridden through miles of prairie in
South America during an Indian raid,
when at every other farm the own
er's mangled body lay at the door.
He has Spent a fortnight below
hatches on a tramp steamer whose
cargo had shifted, with nothing to do
except read the "Faery Queen" and
listen to the Ananias-like yarns of the
chief engineer or watch the captain's
face when that worthy came below,
looking, in Cunninghame-Graham's
graphic phrase, "like Lot's wife when
she cast her laat wistful glance at
Sodom." -

Be Worthless at Present
WASHINGTON, Jan. Official an
nouncement of researches along va- j
rious scientific lines is made in the year
book for 1904 Just issued by the Car
negie Institution of Washington. In
this report Professor Simon Newcomb
point! out that while the nineteenth !
century* has been Industriously piling
Up a vast mass of astronomical, me- j
teorological and sociological data at ;
great expense the world over, the work-
Ing out of results from these observa

To correct this he urges the organi
zation of an institute or bureau "of
exact science in general," the head of
which should be aided by a council of
experts picked from various countries i
to advise as to the various depart- j
ments at work with a view to reach
tag results at small expense which, I
without such organization, never would ,
be reached.
In this connection the approval of
the scheme by such men as Karl Pear- |
son of the University College of Lon
don, Lord Raleigh of the Royal Insti
tution, of Great Britain; G. H. Darwin
of Cambridge has been secured.
Pearson says that at least fifty per
cent of the scientific observations made
and the data collected are worthless
and no man, however able, could de
duce any result from them at all.
"I doubt," says he, "whether even a
small proportion of the biometric data i
being accumulated in Europe and
America could be made to provide valu
able results."
Discussing the Southern observatory |
project, the report says that under the
grants from the Carnegie Institution ,
the direction and velocity of the solar |
motions are being determined from all j
available material and before the close
of 1905 results are expected from 5000 !
of the more frequently observed stars.
A new determination of the positions
of standard stars distributed from the
north to the smith poles of the heavens,
will be undertaken shortly. The need
Of special observations of stars that i
have been neglected for the past twenty

The report makes extended observa

Former President Cleveland
Urges That We Be a
Strongly Reverent People
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 29;âGrover â¢
Cleveland was the principal speaker j
at to-day's exercises in connection I
with the celebration of the fiftieth an- [
niversary of the Philadelphia Young |
Men's Christian Association. Three
meetings were held this afternoon. At j
one of them Harry A. Garfield, son of
the president, who holds the profes- j
sorship of American politics at Prince- i
ton, spoke. Cleveland's theme was
"Christianity." He said among other j
things:
As a serious minded people, conscious ot the j
immense responsibility resting on us In the I
matter of popular rule, we should be a reverent j
peopleânot merely by lip service, but ruggedly, |
strongly reverent. This Is not to say we should I
be a tad and gloomy people. On the contrary, i
with free Institutions and with equality of !
rights and opportunity which no other country I
offers, we should be the most cheerful and
light htarted people In the world.
It is not worth while to blink at the fact
that, without going far from home, we can j
gain a hint that nations called civilized and |
even Christian are liable under strong tempta- j
tien to backslide to barbarism, which permits ;
war and slaughter to count for a people's
greatness and reckons ruthless conquest among !
glorious deeds. There is one effective and con- j
stant preventive against such danger and that j
is the sincere acceptance, as guidance to na
tional behavior, of the honor, the love of peace,
the d3votion to justice and truth, the forbear- ;
ance and Inviolable good faith which grow out j
of genuine Christianity and civilization No I

RECESSION BILL
FINDS ENEMIES
Judge Conley of Madera Is
Actively Lobbying Against
Yosemite Valley Measure
WARM FIGHT EXPECTED
Claim Is Made That Pres
ence of Soldier Guardians
in Park Menaces Campers
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 29.âThe fight
on the Tosemite recession bill reopens
this week, Wednesday on special or
der of the House and Thursday in the
Senate. Neither side is confident of
victory at this time, though the anti
recessionists claim accessions of
strength and are laying much Stress
of the effect of lobbying against the
bill last week of Judge William M.
Conley of Madera.
Judge Conley said that neither the
question of sentiment nor the ques
tion of finance supplied a basis for his
argument against recession, but that
his opposition to the bill was based on
the fact that if the valley is re-ceded
to the Federal Government it will
mean that the same will be patroled
by "Federal troops, negroes in all
probability, and in this he saw a
grave menace to the safety of camp
ers and others that may visit the res
ervation. He says that last summer
negroes cut open several tents and
insulted women that were in the val
ley, their conduct being the inevitable
result of isolation and the lack of
proper restraint.
, The proponents of the bill, how
ever, say that the condition of which
Judge Conley complains can easily be
remedied, and that if proper represen
tations are made to the .authorities
at Washington a different class of
guardians will be placed valley
and the danger of criminal acts on the
part of large bodies of troops elim
inated.
Jones of Tuolumne is the leader of
the opposition to the bill in the As
sembly. He says the report that the
people of his own district are in fa
vor of recession is untrue and that it
was started from the fact that a few
people got togetfier in pne small town
and adopted a resolution favoring it.
Assemblyman Jones will advance,
among other arguments, that while
California does not seem to be taking
the best of care of the Yosemite now,
the State is growing rapidly and in a
few years will be able and anxious to
do its full duty by the valley. An
other argument will be that of local
pride, his contention being that it
would be just as reasonable to re-cede
Golden Gate Park to the State of Cali
fornia as to re-cede the Yosemite to
the National Government.

CORBIN IN SACRAMENTO.
Reaches Capital in "Custody" of Two
Senate Attaches.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29.âWilliam
Corbin, secretary and rrfanager of the
Continental Building and Loan Asso
ciation of San Francisco, arrived here
to-night in custody of Assistant
Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate Jo
seph Tuite and Edward Shaw. Cor
bin. who is suffering from an affection
of the stomach, was accompanied by
his physician, Dr. J. G. Crawford.
Those who gathered to witness the
arrival of Corbin, expecting to see
him burdened with irons or wear
ing Oregon boot to prevent
a further effort on his part to ruffle
the dignity of the upper house, were
disappointed. That he is only tech
nically in custody was manifest, for
after he was assigned to his rooms in
the Golden Eagle he was left alone
with his physician,' his custodians de
clin'ng in invitation to occupy cots
in the roOm to prevent a possible
break for liberty and a wild flight to
the border on his part.
It is pretty well settled to-night that
Corbin will escape punishment for his
alleged contempt of the authority of
the Senate.
DISPOSITION OF FINES.
Leavitt Introduces Bill for Benefit of
Oakland.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29.â1n an ef
fort to aid in a small way the much as
saulted treasury of the city of Oak
land at the expense of the oft de
pleted coffers of Alameda County,
Senator Leavftt has introduced a bill
providing that all fines and forfeitures
collected in any Police Court or City
Justice's Court, whether collected for
a violation of a State law or city ordi
nance, shall be paid to the Treasurer
of the city in which such court is lo
cated. As the law now stands fines
for violation of State laws go to the
county treasury, the city only collect
ing for infractions of its ordinances.
Senator Leavitt points out that the
county of Alameda does not pay one
dollar for the support of Oakland's
Police Courts, but is reaping a large
income through them.
Leavitt promises to amend his bill
so as to exclude these peculiarly situ
ated counties. After this is done those
that now oppose his measure say they
will give it their support.

READY TO DIE
For the First Time Con
demned Woman Appears
Resigned to Her Fate
SENDS FOE CLERGYMAN
Attorney Attributes to Pub
lic Clamor the Verdict That
Sends Her to the Gallows
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
WINDSOR, Vt., Jan. 29.â"Christ,
looking beneath the exterior animal
and seeing the life in the deepest re
cesses of the soul, sought it not to de
stroy," was the theme of Rev. Jonath
an K. Fuller's impressive discourse to
170 prisoners in the State prison
chapel this morning.
"No man or woman is so depraved
but we can see beneath the animal, af
ter all its rioting is over, that within
every soul which, if turned aright,
may bring every man or woman into
the glory of the Redeemer."
While no direct reference was made
to Mary Mabel Rogers, who is to be
hanged on Friday for the murder of
her husband, Marcus Rogers, there
was no mistaking the chaplain's
meaning. v
After the service the pastor went to
the cell and spent two hours with
Mary Rogers, who knelt in prayer be
side him. To-day, for the first time,
she signified to Superintendent Oaks
that she desired that Chaplain Fuller
should be at her execution. The chap
lain will administer communion on
Thursday or Friday morning, before
the final scene on the scaffold.
For the first two nights after her
transfer to the condemned cell, Mary
Rogers never closed her eyes. Since
then she has become more resigned,
but does not sleep well and passes
many wakeful hours in the night.
"I have not been guilty of all they
have* accused me of," she said, "but
I have been a very wicked woman."
Mer concern seems to be more for
the wanton life she has led and her
future than for the murder for which
her life is demanded. She does not
mention that now, nor has she alluded
to it in weeks.
"Unfortunately for Mary Rogers,"
said a Windsor attorney to-day, "there
was an outcry in the Vermont papers
that the law prescribing death penal
ty had become a farce. The death
penalty in the case of seven murder
ers, all sentenced to be hanged, had
been commuted, and the demand was
that somebody be hanged. Just then
unhappy fate produced Mary Rogers
as that person. That is why the Leg
islature was so insistent that no
change in the law be made."

miles southwest of Corvallis, solves
the mystery of the disappearance
eleven years ago of J. W. Stanturff, a
young hunter.
In January, 1894T Stanturff went out
on a hunt in the mountains, though
there was a heavy snowfall on the
ground. Stories of foul play were
bruited â¢ about when he did not re
turn. When trappers a day or two
since came upon the grewsome relics,
the bones of the feet were still en
cased in the long rubber boots worn
by Stanturff when he left home. Bits
of clothing and pocket pieces com

CHURCH'S DUTY
TO IMMIGRANT
President Speaks at Dedi
cation of Restored Luther
Place House of Worship
MUST HELP NEWCOMER
Roosevelt Points Out Value
of Helping Hand Extended
to Transplanted Citizen
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29.âPresident
Roosevelt delivered an address to-day
at (he dedication of the Luther-place
Memorial Church, which was seriously
damaged by fire Just one year ago to
night. The church has been entirely
restored. The President entered the
church while the services preliminary
to the sermon were in progress and
was shown to a seat in the pulpit. At
the conclusion of the services he was
introduced. President Roosevelt said:
From the standpoint from which I am
obliged so continually to look at matters
there is a peculiar function to be played by
the grqat Lutheran church in the L'nited
States ot America. This Is a churca which
had Its rise to power in. and, until it emi
grated to this side of the water, had always
had its fullest development in the two great
races of Northern and Middle Europe, the
Germans and the Scandinavians. The
Lutheran church came to the territory which
is now the United States very shortly after
the first permanent settlements were made
within our limits, for when the earliest set
tlers came to dwell around the mouth of the
Delaware they brought the Lutheran worship
with them, and It was so with the earliest
German settlers, who came to Pennsylvania
and afterward to New York ami the mountain
ous regions in the western part of Virginia
and the Statea south of It.
From that day to this the history of the
growth in population in this nation has con
sisted largely, In some respects mainly, of the
arrival of successive waves of newcomers to
our shores and the prime duty of those already
in the land- is to see that their own progress
and development are shared by these newcom
ers. It is a serious and dangerous thing for
any man to tear loose from the soil, from the
region in which he and his forbears have
taken root, and to be transplanted Into a new
land. He should receive all possible aid in
that new land; and the ard can be tendered
him most effectively by those who can appeal
to him on the ground of spiritual kinship.
Therefore the Lutheran church can do most
in helping upward and onward so many of
the newcomers to our shores; and. It seems to
me that It should be, I am tempted to say,
well nigh the prime duty of this church to seÂ«
that the immigrant, especially the emigrant
of Lutheran faith from the Old World, wheth
er he come from Scandinavia or Germany, or
whether he belonged to one of the Lutheran
countries of Finland or Hungary or Austria,
may be not suffered to drift off with no
friendly hand extended to him out of all the
church communion, away from all the Influ
ences that tend toward safeguarding and up
lifting him and that he finds ready at hand
those ready to bring him into fellowship with
ex Is tine modes.
The Lutheran is destined to be one of the
two or three greatest and ir.oat important na
tional churches in the United States; one of
the two cr three churches most distinctly
American, most distinctively among the forces
that are to tell for making this country even
greater in the future.
Therefore a peculiar load of responsibility
rests upon the members of this church. It is
an important thing for the people of this
nation to remember their rights, but it is an
even more Important thing for them to re
member their duties.
In the last analysis the work of statesmen
and soldiers, the work of the public man,
shall iro for nothing if it is not based upon
the spirit of Christianity working in the mil
lions of homes throughout this country so that
there may be that social, that spiritual, that
moral foundation without which no country can
ever rise to greatness. '
Let me congratulate you and congratulate all
of us that we live In such a land and at a
time that we expect as natural that there
should be an interdenominational service of
thanksgiving, such a ceremony as is to take
place this afternoon. In which the pastors of
other churches join to congratulate themselves
and you upon the rebuilding of this church.
One of the constant problems of life Is to try
to cultivate breadth without shallowness. Just
as we want to try to cultivate depth without
narrowness.

Amador Couifty Physician
Accused of Poisoning His
Wife Caught in Ensenada
â 
WILL BE EXTRADITED
Love for Another Woman Is
Believed to Have Been the
Cause of Alleged Crime
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 29.âDr. J. N. Sta
ples, who is wanted by the Sheriff of
Amador County on a charge of wife
murder, and Mrs. Hoxsie, his alleged
accomplice, have been arrested at En
senada, Mexico. They will be extra
dited and returned to Amador County
for trial.
About three months ago Dr. Staples,
who has been practicing medicine in
Amador City, suddenly disappeared
shortly after the death of his wife. Mr*.
Hoxsie. wife of the foreman of Jasper
McDonald's mine, suddenly left her
home at the same time, and inquiry
developed the fact that she and the
physician had gone together.
Suspicions were then aroused as to
the death of Mrs. Staples. Her body
was exhumed and an analysis of the
stomach revealed the presence of poi
son. Mrs. Hoxsie had assisted in caring
for Mrs. Staples during an attack of
typhoid fever, and the mutual infatua
tion of the nurse and the husband that
developed is believed to have been re
sponsible for the alleged poisoning of
the doctor's wife.
A month or more ago word came to
the police here that certain officials at
Ensenada thought that Staples and the
woman were in that country. A de
scription was sent down, but aa the
reward was only $100 the Mexican offi
cers did not care to make the trip
after him. Several days since came
another request for a description and
it was sent again and the two ware
arrested and landed in the Ensenada
cuartel.
HEARST SCORES "SCOOP"
AND MAY BE PROSECUTED
Extra Edition Describes Acquittal of

BOSTON, Jan. 29.âHearst's Boston
American printed an advance edition
of 200,000 copies containing an account
of the acquittal of Charles L. Tucker,
the man convicted of the murder of
Mabel Page. When- the verdict of con
viction was rendered the frantic pub
lishers made a desperate attempt to re
call the edition, but It was too late*.
The deception of the reading public,
however, is not the gravest part of the
offense. Attorney General Parker has
a copy of the "not guilty" publication,
and it is said that action which is con
templated looks to the punishment of
the managers or owners of the Ameri
can for anticipating the verdict of the
jury, and by publishing and circulating
a false report assuming to speak for
the Jury and so coming within the
meaning of contempt of court.

"KINDERGARTEN" SPLIT
ON FIGHT FOR MAYOR
Oakland Republicans at War
i
Approach of Primaries Finds Young
Party Workers in Two Camps.
OAKLAND, Jan. 29.âThe primary
election for all parties for the munici
pal campaign in Oakland will be held
on Tuesday next and the work has
practically all been done. Candidates
have made their announcements,
tickets are out, the last appeals have
been made and little remains to be
done except to see the votes cast and
counted.
The contest has been an unusual one
and the new political alignments have
been made that bid fair to affect the
future of Alameda County politics for
years to come. What was once known
as "the Kindergarten" in Alameda
County politics has been rent in twain
and haK are behind Frank K. Mott in
his candidacy for the Republican
nomination for Mayor and the other
half behind George E. Randolph.
"The Kindergarten" was never a defi
nite organization. It grew up in the
Fifth Ward among a lot of young men
who took an active interest in poli
tics and the age of its members gave
the name. For years they worked to
gether- and made an impress upon
Alameda County politics, but now they
.are divided and sundered.
Five of the most active members of
"the Kindergarten"â-J. Cal Ewing.
County Clerk J. P. Cook, City Treas
urer Felton Taylor, Deputy County
Clejfk George Pierce and State Sena*

the -fight for George E. Randolph for
Mayor. On the other hand Frank K.
Mott, "the rival candidate, was an orig

behjind him are John Stetson, attorney
for the Lunacy Commission; Dick
Ayer, Deputy Superintendent of
Streets; Clarence Crowell, Court Com
missioner; George E. Jackson and
others. feeling has been arousrd
over the fight and It is improbable
that the same old harmony can ever
again prevail among those who so
long worked together in politics.

F. C. Turner an* City Auditor Arthur
H. Breed. Both these officials, who
are now serving second terms, will be
renominated by the Republican and
Municipal League conventions. But
even these Candidates have not been
able keep out of the trouble and
they have been compelled to take sides
in the Mayoralty fight, though without
raising opposition because of their
great personal popularity. Turner has
united with Councilman Alexander Mc-
Adam in the First Ward and their
ticket will be for Frank K. Mott for
Mayor. Arthur H. Breed has united
with Councilman A. H. Elliott in the
Second Ward and their ticket will also
be for Mott.
WANT LEAGUE'S SUPPORT.
The fight for City Attorney Is a pecu
liar one. City Attroney J. E. McElroy
is a Democrat and will again have that
nomination. But McElroy wants the
Municipal League nomination as well.
Abe P. Leach is a candidate'for the Re
publican nomination, and wants the
Municipal League, indorsement. McEl
roy's candidacy is affecting the Repub
lican fight to some extent, for he has
gone into the Republican struggle in
the Sixth Ward and is behind the Bac
cus-Barnett-Ddody ticket as against
the M. J, Kelly ticket.
Felton Taylor will probably \have no
opposition for City Treasurer, for
though he has gone into the Randolph
camp the Mott ticket in the Fifth Ward
has declared positively for him in spite
of this stand.
- The various ward nominations have
become mixed with the fight for Mayor,
as was inevitable. In the First Ward
Alexander McAdam wants to succeed
himself and has promised his support
to Frank K. Mott for Mayor. There are
rumors of other tickets to be placed
against hi.r. but the only one that has
made its appearance is for D. C. Brown
for Mayor. In the Second Ward the
only-opposition to the Mott-Breed-El
liott ticket is that of D. C. Brown for
Mayor.
In fhe Third Ward there will be three
tickets, one for Frank Mott for Mayor
and George Fitzgerald for Councilman,
another for George EL Randolph for
Mayor and Fitzgerald for Councilman
and a third for D. C. Brown for Mayor.
The Fourth Ward will see a decidedly
hot fight, with three tickets in the field.
The same ward candidates have been
taken up by both factions âEdwin
Meese for Councilman at large, Ei C.
â¢Hahn for Councilman from the ward,
,C. H. Redington for School Director at
large and Robert Yates for School Di
rector from the one ticket
will favor Mott and the other Randolph
for Mayor.
The same condition exists in the Fifth
Ward, where both tickets are for Fel
,ton Taylor for Treasurer, B. H. Pendle
ton for the'Council, John D.'Isaacs for
School Dinector and H. P. Garleton for
Trustee, T>ut one ticket is for
Randolph and one is! for Mott : for
Mayor.
The Sixth Ward is in the midst â¢of a
very bitter fight. Councilman W. J.
Baooas has a ticket in the field for him
self and is backed by Dan Doosy and
.Frank Barnett. The conditions that
â¢have arisen have forced this to be a
Randolph ticket. On the other hand,
M; J. Kelly put a ticket in the field
which was originally for Edwin Meese
fur Mayor, but when Meese drew out
Kelly, by the same .circumstances,
&hrejÂ» himself into the Mott camp. His
ticket will support Victor Chloupek for
The Council. .
j The Seventh Ward is in a peculiar
condition. When the friends of Ran
dolph made up their ticket they com
bined with W. A. Donaldson for the
Council and dropped J T. Wallace, the
Incumbent. Professor Wallace wanted
. to return to the municipal legislative
halls and made a combination with the
jR. H. Chamberlain and Mott forces in
that ward. The ticket headed by John
Yule will be for R. H. Chamberlain for
Mayor and Professor Wallace for the
I Council. This ticket will go to Mott as
| a second choice.
MAYORALTY CANDIDATES BUSY.
I D. C. Brown will put a ticket in every
| ward in the city in his Interests. Mott
| will have a ticket in every ward with
the exception of the Seventh, where he
will take his chances with the Cham
berlain delegates. Randolph will have
i a ticket in every ward except the First
! and Second. He believes that he can
carry all of the other wards. R. H.
j Chamberlain will only put a ticket in
the Seventh Ward. George F. Neece
will not put a ticket in any of the
i wards, but will depend upon his per
i sonal popularity with individual dele
gates.
The present members of the Board of
Education are all candidates to suc
ceed themselves, as are the present
I members of the Library Board, and it
is unlikely that there will be any
changes of importance in these organ
izations.
The Municipal League has pursued
â¢ its usual method of work. It has an
[ nounced a list of delegates proposed by
! its central board of managers, and
I these will undoubtedly be elected
I without oposition, everybody being too
busy with the Republican fights to
bother the league. It has also issued a
list of candidates whose names will be
considered, this list including practi
cally all the candidates, both Republi
can and Democratic, in the entire
town.
MOTT'S STATEMENT.
Frank K. Mott to-night Issued the
following statement of his position
upon the main issue of the campaign,
the water question:
To the Voters of the City of Oakland: I am
a candidate for Mayor, and as the water ques
tion is of paramount Importance you are en
titled to know my position in t*>at regard:
Firstâl favor Issuing bonds for acquiring a
municipal water supply.
SecondâOf all the propositions thus far sub
mitted I favor that of the Bay ClUes Water
Company, to bring a supply of at least
20.000.0U0 gallons of water per day to our
borders.
Thirdâl favor the city holding the bonds
and incurring no further expense until the
water plant can be turned over to the city
1 with a perfect and undisputed title and the
adequacy of the supply is demonstrated.
FourthâWhen water Is brought to tha city
boundary I favor acquiring the Contra Costa
Water Company's distributing system within
the city, provided its physical condition war
rants the purchase and a fair and just price
can be agreed upon.
Fifthâlf the distributing syatam of the
Contra Costa Water Company is Imperfect or
the price asked is unjust I favor InstaKlr.s a
new distributing system. FRAK K. MOTT.
METHODISTS PROTEST AGAINST
PROPOSED SALE OF BUILDING
Many Clergymen and Laymen Are Op
posed to Relinquishing Local
Book Concern Property.
The reported sale of the Methodist
Book Concern building at 1037 Mar
ket street by Eaton & Mains of the
New York Book Concern has roused
the indignation of many Methodist
clergymen and laymen of this city.
An injunction will be asked for to re
strain the sale if it is not too late.
Prominent local Methodists maintain
that no one has a right to dispose of
the place without the approval of the
book committee of the general con
ference. This committee will meet at
New York on February 8, when the
transfer will be attacked by repre
sentatives of California Methodism.
Most of the money used in the erec
tion of the building in dispute was
furnished by local Methodists; the
rest was given by the church. For
several years the place has caused dis
sension: InÂ» 1900 the property and
business of the local book concern
were taken out of the hands of the
Rev. Dr. John D. Hammond and given
In charge of a committee made up of
Rolla V. Watt, C. B. Perkins, I. J.
Truman, Rev. E. R. Dille and Rev. E.
P. Dennett, with A. J. Wallace and
T. C. Muller of Los Angeles. Their
work was so well done that the gen
eral conference reappointed them in
1904. Methodists opposed to Dr.
Hammond believe that the contract
to sell the church building was made
at his instigation. Rev. Dr. Fred D.
Bovard, editor of the California Chris
tian Advocate, and Deputy City Treas
urer Charles B. Perkins of the local
book concern committee will attend
the meeting of the general book com
mittee of the church in New York
next month and will use every effort
to block the sale. They and other
prominent Methodists declare that
Eaton & Mains are only trustees,for
the church, without power to sell
property, and they propose to test this
belief, if necessary, in a suit for an
injunction.

DEATH CLOUDS
WEDDING PARTY
Accident to Japanese Roys
terers Causes a Fatal
ity and Injures Two Men
RUNAWAY WAGON UPSET
Victims Returning From
Celebration of Friends'
Nuptials Pitch Into Eoad
Oakland Office San Francisco pall,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 29.
One man dead and two badly injured
is the result of an accident last night
to a party of Japanese in Fruitvale
while they were celebrating the nup
tials at Fruitvale of two of their coun
try people from the faraway land of
nlppon.
The three were pitched out by an up
set runaway team on the San Leandro
road, near High street, while returning
from the wedding feast, which was
given at the Japanese Nursery Com
pany's grounds on Central avenue. A
wheel of the wagon ran over M. Saka
kibara's head, causing injuries from
which he died at 10:30 o'clock this
morning. T. Takashimi, another of the
exhilarated wedding guests.was thrown
so heavily that one arm was broken
and he also sustained numerous cuts
and "bruises. The third victim was Y.
Sakemuda, who suffered the fracture of
an ankle in the mixup.
This party of roysterers with many
other Japanese had been enjoying the
day to Its fullest. There had been much
feasting and toasting, with all of the
concomitants that go to ntake an auspi
cious event of the nuptial ceremony.
The bridegroom, according to the cus
tom of his country, had waited long for
the choice of his heart. On the last
steamer from the land of the Mikado
came the pretty maid whom he sfcd
won years ago as his affianced one.
Much preparation had been made by
the Japanese colony in Fruitvale for
the* important ceremonial. Saki, the na
tional Japanese beverage, waa quaffed
in many bumpers to the blushing
bride and smiling groom.
Homeward bound went the guests af
ter the .celebration, and overjoyful
were many of them there at. To the
lot of those concerned in the fatal ac
cident it happened that the driver lost
control of his horses, who tore along
the road until the wagon overturned
and dumped its occupants into the
road. The injured were removed to
their homes, after receiving attention
from Dr. A. H. Dodge,, who had been
called. He said skull was
probably fractured. The dead Japan
ese was 43 years old, a carpenter.
Coroner Mehrmann took charge of the
case.

Hints of daring joshhes directed by the
authors of the sophomore burlesque, "Hamlet,"

work.

LIVELY TOPICS
AT UNIVERSITY
Sportsmen Interested in the
Selection of a Football
Coach for Blue and Gold
COMING OF STATESMEN
Visit of the Legislators Is
Looked Forward To by Stu
dents as W r ell as Faculty
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street. Jan. 29.
Students and the faculty of the
University of California are to have
two Important but widely diverse topics
for consideration during- the coming
, week, one subject relating to State
politics and the other affecting college
sport.
A committee of twenty members of
I the State Legislature Is to visit the
| university next Friday, according to
lan announcement issued from Presi
, dent Wheeler's office. The committee
lis to be entertained by the president,
: and will be shown about the campus,
with opportunity to see all the univer
i slty's activities. The guests will at
j tend the semi-monthly university
i meeting In Harmon Gymnasium, will
! hear addresses by speakers whose
names have not yet been announced,
will also hark to the singing of the col
legians and the shouts of the "rooters"
and so see for themselves some of the
work of the State institution and some
of its manifest needs.
The visit is expected to bear fruit in
the shape of cordial relations between
the university and the State authori
ties, which relations, it is hoped, will
be such as to lead to the appropriat
ing of money needed to carry on the
university's* work, particularly in the
agricultural department.
Equally interesting to most colle
gians, though of a greatly different
character from this political matter, is
the question of a football coach âthe
choice of a man to lead the blue and
gold to victory.
Now that it has been as good as set
tled that professional poaches may be
employed by both California and Stan
ford, the campus buzzes with gossip
about what men will be considered by
the executive committee of the asso
ciated students as candidates for the
position. Smith of Columbia is talked
of, as are others, but the disposition to
get the best coach available, regardless
of expense, is evident, there being an
almost fanatical desire shown to wipe
out this year the memory of the de
cisive defeat administered California
by Stanford last year.
The executive committee is to meet
next Tuesday night,-toâ¢receive a report
from the California men who represent
ed the university at the meeting last
night in San Francisco of the intercol
legiate agreement committee.
The Carnot debate with Stanford
takes place next Friday night, at Stan
ford. Musgrove, Baker and Harrison
will represent California, with Emil
Nathan as alternate.
Professor Wells is to read a paper on
the "Epic and the Dramatic Novel" at
the Philological Club meeting at the
Faculty Club to-morrow night. Pro
fessor Margolis will read a paper on
"The Babylonian Epoch."
Robert Dupouey will deliver two lec
tures in French at the Students' Ob
servatory on Tuesday and Wednesday
afternoons, his subjects being "How
Do You Like France?" and Do
We Like America?"
Many university students will Jour
ney to Stanford next Friday to attend
the semi-annual meeting of the Bay
Students' Volunteer Union, which is to
be held there in the afternoon of that
day.
HELPERS OF ZION SOCIETY
HOLD ANNUAL MEETING
Persecuted Jews in Russia Appeal to
Americans for Redress and a
Home Among Free Men.
The annual meeting of the Helpers
of Zion Society was held at B'nai
B rith Hall last night. The object of
the society is to assist in securing

and liberties of human being"*.
The meeting was addressed by
President Myers, Maurice Bro Â»sky. a
tat nted speaker and writer from Aus
trella, President Jonas of tha Zion of
Osikland, all of whom dwelt at con
siderable length on the work of the
Zionist Society throughout the United
States.
Maurice Brodsky went into facts
and figures regarding the question be
fore the meeting. He said there
were 60.000 Jews in Russia without
rights of any kind accorded to other
subjects of that empire.
At the conclusion of the addresses
the following officers were elected for
the ensuing year: President, Rabbi
Isidore Myers; first vice president, M.
S. Lejry; second vice president, Bern

Goldstein; corresponding secretary, R.
W. Brown; financial secretary, S.
Liehtein; board of directors, L. R.
Goldberg, L Schaff, Dr. H. Eppstein,
L. Album, I. Hahn and W. Bernstein.
The report of the secretary and treas
urer showed the society to be in a
flourishing condition and in full active
accord with the parent body in New
York.
Drew the Color Line.
The color line was drawn a trifle too
tightly in a New York restaurant the
ot,her evening. A-distinguished Hindoo,
traveling under the name of Onchata
A. B. Clayton, entered the place clad
in Immaculate evening clothes of the
latest London cut. The waiter could
only 3ee his pronounced brunette com
tilexion and denied his request for a
able. The visitor expostulated indig
nantly, but in vain, and he was on the
point of being ejected when some one
in authority hurried up and. after
making profound apologies, prevailed
upon the Oriental traveler to accept a
place of honor in the cafe.
TAKES FATHER
KING'S PARISH
Illustrious Clergyman's Suc
cessor Is Installed by
Archbishop Montgomery
DEMPSEY AN OAKLANDER
New Priest Returns to His
Boyhood Home to Begin
Work in His Chosen Field
i
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broad way, t Jan. 29.
The Rev. Father Edward Dempsey,
who succeeds the late Rev. Michael
King as pastor of St. Mary's Church
of the Immaculate Conception, was
formally Installed to-day, the service of
Installation being conducted by Arch
bishop Montgomery, assisted by Father
F. X. Morrison, Father M. Clifford and
Father J. J. Cranwell. The services
began at 10:30 a. m. with solemn high
mass, celebrated by Father Dempsey.
A Gounod mass was sung by an aug
mented choir, with full orchestral ac
companiment, the music having been
specially arranged by Adolph Gregory.
At the close of the mass Archbishop
Montgomery â¢ formally presented the
new pastor to the members of the
parish. The Archbishop spoke in glow
ing terms of Father King, the revered
founder and for fifty years the pastor
of St. Mary's parish, and spoke of the
necessity of hearty co-operation be
tween the pastor and members of the
church. He then presented the new
pastor to the congregation, and after
the formal introduction said:
In Father Dempsey the people of St. Mary's
parish will find a man worthy lh every respect
to take up the work of the illustrious founder
of this church, one who will follow In the foot
steps of the pastor whom you all loved.
Father Dempsey is well known to many of
the members of this church, for he was born
In Oakland, and he returns to his former home
to assume the pastorate of the oldest parish
In his native city.
The address of Archbishop Mont
gomery concluded the installation ser
vices, which were attended by many
members of the clergy from the
churches of Alameda County and from
San Francisco.
In the afternoon a reception in honor
of Father Dempsey was held in the
parish hall at Seventh and Castro
streets, to which all the members of
the parish were invited, that they
might become acquainted with their
pastor. The address of welcome was
delivered by J. J. McDonald, who, on
behalf of the members of the parish,
greeted the successor of Father King.
In his response to Mr. McDonald's
address Father Dempsey expressed his
gratification at once more returning to
the home of his boyhood. He said:
Twenty years ago I left this city, and little
did I dream then that the scene of my life
work would be among the friends of my child
hood. When his Grace told me I was to
come to Oakland I knew I was to come among
friends who will aid me in the work I have
to do. Such aid is necessary, for the efforts
of the priest are fruitless unless he receives
the support and encouragement of his people.
While i am pastor of this parish my greatest
endeavor shall be to follow in the footsteps of
your late pastor, Father King.

LONDON, Jan. 29.âThe tone of the
stock market was weak in the early
days of last week consequent on the
bad news from Russia which, although
to some extent discounted, nevertheless
brought a rush of selling by timid
holders.
The market in the midweek was well
recovered .and continued to improve
under good support. Strength was de
rived from gold shipments of this
country and an encouraging bank
statement. Indications of cheap money
brought new speculative buying.

GOOD OUTLOOK
FOR THE YEAR
January Market Conditions
a Surprise to the Most
Confident Realty Dealers
COTTAGES IN DEMAND
Many Purchasers From San
Francisco Seek Small Cen
trally Located Houses
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 29.
The real estate record of the opening
month of the new year has surprised
even the most optimistic of Oakland's
brokers. Not only was the number of
transactions greater than ever before
during the same season, but there have
been many sales of business and resi
dence property to non-resident in
vestors, people from the East and
South. As a rule this class of deals is
confined to the months of July, August
and September, when Eastern people
are planning to escape their severe
winter.
There has, of course, been a marked
lull as compared with the rush of busi
ness just before the holidays, but the
record of sales for January shows a
material increase over the record for
the same month of any preceding year.
Interest in the approaching primary
election has had considerable effect on
the market during the last week, as
prospective purchasers residing in Oak
land have b%en Inclined to await the
result of the election before closing
any deals. This, of course," merely
affects people already residents of this
city.
SAN FRANCISCO BUYERS.
A considerable percentage of the
January business has been the purchase
of small residence properties by people
from San Francisco, who, in most
cases, seek places on the lines of the
Key route and Southern Pacific ferry
system.
The renting departments of all the
larger real estate offices have been
busy during the month, the greatest
demand being for small houses, flats
and cottages, centrally located and con
venient to the street car lines, the ma
jority of those inquiring for houses to
rent asking for places south of Fortieth
street.
Two of the most Important sales of
the month have been made by J. H.
Macdonald & Co., the first being the
sale of a two-story brick building on
the south side of Twelfth street, be
tween Broadway and Franklin street,
to A. Jonas. The- lot is 26 by 100 feet.
The purchase price was $18,000. The
second transaction was the sale of 80
acres of the old Stevens tract in Fruit
vale to George H. Lee. The price paid
was $65,000.
The E. P. Vandercook Company is
at present offering some fine centrally

YOUTH SHOOTS
HIS COMPANION
Hunting Accident Cause of
the Serious Wounding of
Man in Contra Costa Hills
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 29.
George Robinson, 35 years old, a gar
dener employed by A. D. Pryal at Clare
mont. was seriously if not fatally shot
this morning by William Casaurang, U
years old. while they, with Charles
Rich, 10 years old, were hunting in the
Contra Costa foothills near Lake Te
mescal. A bullet of small caliber from
the boy's rifle entered Robinson's right
lung, causing a severe internal hemor
rhage, which the Receiving Hospital
surgeons pronounced dangerous.
Young Casaurang was about to fire
at a bird when he stepped into some
brush, slipped and while falling acci
dentally discharged the weapon. Rob
inson was directly In front of the boy
and ten or twelve feet distant when tha
piece was fired. The bullet struck the
wounded man an inch or so to the right
of the breast bone. He fell and yelled
he had been shot- The boys ran to tha
Berkeley Quarry Company's place and
got helo. Men carried Robinson to
the Claremont road and he was taken
thence to the Receiving Hospital, where
Dr. R. T. Stratton attended the patient.
Robinson said the shooting was acci
dental. Deputy Sheriff Fred Murdock
took charge of the boys and turned the
older one, who had done the shooting,
over to the District Attorney. The boys*
stories tallied with that of Robinson.
Casaurang is the son of Frank Casau
rang, owner of the Oakland French
dairy, which is located on Vernon ave
nue, In the hills near the Pryal home,
where Robinson lived. Rich is a neigh
bor's son.

VESSEL REACHES PORT
GENERAL FOY ARRIVES FROM SWANSEA
Another weather battered French sail
ing vessel reached port yesterday, when
the French bark General Foy, 2*44 days
fr.om Swansea, passed in through the
Golden Gate and dropped anchor in
quarantine. Not so long on the way by
nearly eight months as was the Bay
onne, whose wanderings ended Satur
day evening, the General Foy made
far from a flash passage. Like the
Bayonne, she was worsted in a battle
with the elements early on the voyage
and was compelled to put into Monte
video for repairs.
For eight days prior to July 24, 1904, j
tÂ°he General Foy encountered heavy j
southwesterly gales. On July 24, in lat- I
itude 45 south, longitude 68 west, the j
â¢peas rolled mountain high and many I
wav&r swept the bark's decks. One
hundred and twenty feet of her bul- i
w arks and rell disappeared under the j
bombardment of angry seas, eight deck 1
beams were broken and the main deck 1
was stove In. A lifeboat was washed !
overboard and several sails were blown !
away.
â¢The General Foy put into Montevideo '
August 13. made repairs and on October I
3 resumed her voyage. She wbe 115
days coming to this port from Monte
video. 1
Many Vessels Reach Port.
Mere than a -core of vessels passed in
through the Golden Gate yesterday between
sunrise and dfcrk. Most of them we:- lumber
carrying coasters and nearly all of them re
ported having encountered heavy weather. Th?
schouner Joseph Russ. 19 days from Astoria,
and the sehoon-er Beulah. which left the Oregon
port two days later, wen for ten days flghtlr.x
southeasterly gales. Among; the late arrival!
Â»Os the schooner Mary Dodge, for whose
safety seme anxiety had been experienced.
She was from Eureka and occupied IS days
coming from the two hundred and sixteen mile
away port.
Codfisher Arrives.
Tbe codflshlng schocnor Stanl?y, Cartain
Wallstedt. arrived yesterday. 21 days fitra
Pirate Cove. She brought 205,000 codfish
Captain Wallstedt reports the weather at
Pirate Cove bitterly cold and very storm v. The
Staniew left Pirate Cove in a gale and after
three days' vain fight against the storm, put
bark and awaited better weather.

A Sensible Plan.
It is a sensible plan all around for
Mr. Hemenway to finish up his work
as chairman c/f appropriations In the
House before he becomes a Senator,
and for Mr. Fairbanks co remain a Sen
ator until it is time for him to assume
the Vice Presidency. This is especially

likely to mean a pretty general shift

The Manufactured Snail.
Through a suit brought by a Paris ;
workman against his employer for in- j
juries received while operating a ma- )
chine for making artificial snails the ;
information has been broueht to light
that in the case of a majority of the
snails offered in the market only the
shells are real, the contents being cat
m*-at out in corkscrew-form by ingen
ious machinery. Parisian epicures are
said to prefer the artificial to the
me, even though the latter has fed" it
self among the vine leaves of Burgun
dy, finding* in the manufactured escar- j
got a special delicacy of flavor that Is
highly enjoyed. On all accounts, then,
Americans who are interested in the
matter may better spend their time in
learning to eat cat meat than in ac
quiring a taste for snails.âProvidence

A Gathering of Linguists.
At the dinner given by Father Reis,
pastor of the Church of San Lorenzo,
to the English-speaking priests of the,
city, there were present eight clergy
men of the Catholic church, every one
of whom was a linguist.
Including English, which they all
spoke fluently, the total number of
languages spoken by the party of eight
amounted to twenty-eight, an average
of three and a half languages to each
man. This fact was ascertained by an
actual investigation, which Father
Hunt-Cortez, whose inquisitlveness in
linguistic matters is well known, made
during the dinner.âMexican Herald.

DURING SERMON
Key. W. Rader's Eulogy of
Life of William McKinley
Touches His Congregation
HONOR CARNATION DAY
â-â¦
Late President's Favorite
Flower Decorates Pulpit I
at Howard-Street Church j
Carried away with the stirring and j
patriotic words of the Rev. William
Rader, pastor of the Third Congrega
tional Church, at yesterday morning's
service, the vast body of worshipers
burst out into applause.
The subject which aroused the con
gregation to unusual demonstration
was â¢ Character Building as Illustrated
by the Life and Career of William Mc- |
Kinley," delivered at the behest of the
Outdoor Art League.
Being the anniversary of the lament- !
ed President's birth, the theme was
timely and the treatment was that of a
minister who saw in the life of the mar- 1
tyr all that goes to elevate and ennoble, |
an example of heroism that in itself |
must stand for all time a living monu
ment to the dead.
The decorations were an American
flag and carnations, the flower which
President McKinlf" loved and because
of which his birthday bears the name
â¢ carnation day.''
The speaker dwelt upon the immor
tality of influence as expressed in char- I
acter, and said that 'McKinley was still
President of the United States, that the
people's vote was for him quite as much
as for Roosevelt; that Washington
framed the nation. Lincoln defended it, !
McKinley expanded It and Roosevelt is
the interpreter of all these administra
tions."
Among the forces making up his char
acter were the home, the army and a
devotion to the highest religious ideals.
Referring to the last Mr. Rader made
a local application to present affairs in
this city and commended the present
Grand Jury.
"McKinley's character," he said, "was
expressed in gentleness." Secretary
Hay in his memorial address said that
McKinley died like a gentleman. In
his gentleness was bravery, firrrfness
and moral power. His strength was
that of the light whi h colors the flow- '
er, swells the bud and ripens the fruit. ;
SINCERE PATRIOTISM.
It was disclosed In his statesmanship,
vhich was never apart from his char
acter. The dangerous menace of the'
republic is tht man who uses his
statesmanship as a means of robbery.
In McKinley's politics was a manly and
sincere patriotism, and he llljstrated
"the greatness of real goodness and
the goodness of real greatness."
McKinley would be remembered i
chiefly for what he said, what he did
and what he was.
Speaking on the point of his deeds,
Mr. Rader reviewed the political events
of his administration and showed how 1
his Philippine policy has been vlndl
cated by subsequent events, saying
that "in the history of war it was j
never known that a . ation htÂ»d con-'
quered another and paid millions in |
money for the privilege." Reference 1
was made to the tragedy at Buffalo j
and the spirit of anarchy In the United I
States and to his plea in behalf of the
man who shot him and his beautiful 1
surrender to the inevitable.
The wonderful bronze gates in Flor
ence, said Mr. Rader, which Dante
thought fit for Paradise, were once cov
ered with gold, but time has stripped
thei.i of their gold, leaving only the
hard and enduring bronze. Gradually
time strips us of adornment, and even
now the bronze appears in the charac
ter of William McKinley, who is an
example to all young people for faith
fulness, fidelity and manhood.
THE HYMN" HE LOVED.
The cHoii" and congregation, sang the
la\tÂ« President's favorite hymn,
"Neater. My God. to Thee,"' and Kip
ling's "Kecessional."
Howard-street Methodist Episcopal
t'hurch was filled with worshipers at
'he morning service, when "Carnation
day" was observed and touching refer
ence made to the lamented President.
The Rc\. A. C. Bane, the pastor,
gave up hi* pulpit to the Rev. George
I. Simth. who spoke eloquently of th?
Idle 'A'ilHam McKinley. The pulpit
waa profusely decorated with carna
tions and draped with the American
flag, while a picture of the late Presi
dent frtflTÃ from the folds of the stars
and f;tiites.
Dr. Smyth said that he was pleased
to trench In that church because :t
was McKinley memorial day and be
cause of the lamented President's great
interest in missions. Jtift prior to his
death the Chinese Consul visited Mr.
McKinley snd among other things he
Inquired as to the work of the mis
sionaries in China and complimented
them. The late Pre-.c]. Nt, said Dr.
Smyth, represented the best and high
est In American life.
In the evening Dr. Bane held a revi
val meefinr as a preface to the big
union rev'val meetings vhich begin at
the church on Thursday evening under
the leadership of th" Uev Joseph H
Smith <>f Philadelphia and Â»he Rev. H.

BISHOP'S GRACIOUS ACT.
Occupies Pulpit of Rev. Mr. Reilly
Who Had Been 111.
Bishop Nichols did a gracious act
yesterday when he expressed his desire
to officiate at the service at St. Paul's
Church, California and Filmore streets,
owing to the recent indisposition of the
rector, the Rev. M. W. Reilly. Mr.
Reilly had returned from San Ber
nardino much improved, but the
Bishop's kindly offer was accepted.
Bishop Nichols spoke of the work
jof the convention held at Grace
! Church last week, saying that a con
i ventlon costs something. He asked
I whether It was worth the time and
L money expended upon it and then de
| voted himself to a lucid explanation
!of all the great work achieved. In the
j first place, he said. It was an account
j ing. The Bishop was required to give
jan account of the work he had done
i during the year; every pastor was re
quired to give an account of his work,
â¢of the number baptized and confirmed
and the communicants; so, too, the
ORATORS TALK
ON SOCIALISM
Spellbinders at Alhambra
Pour Forth Eloquence iv
Four Different Tongues
HALL IS OVERCROWDED
c
Accommodating Speakers
Address Overflow Meetings
on the Street Corners
One of the biggest gatherings of
Socialists in the history of the party in
San Francisco was held last night at
the Alhambra Theater. So great was
the crush that the doors of the edifice
were closed In the faces of hundreds
who craved admittance and later
stormed and railed because the chance
of hearing a spellbinder cry out for
vengeance against the Czar was denied
them.
Speakers addressed the assemblage
In many tongues. Austin Lewis and
Arthur M. Lewis poured forth their
eloquence In the English language;
Lockv.itzky upbraided the ruler of the
Russians in his native tongue; J. Sa
vala told the people in plain Finnish
what he thought of the reign of the 1
Romanoffs; H. Rossenblatt delivered
his oration In Yiddish, while Ozar, a
native of far-aÂ»ay Finland, spoke so
that none save his own countrymen
ki.ew what he was talking about.
The meeting was called several days
ago and was well- advertised among
the followers of socialism. It was a
sort of general indignation gathering
to give the people the real "low down"
on the uprising In Russia. When the
spellbinders had succeeded in working
those present up to the desired stage
o! enthusiasm a call for coin was made
and the- collection taken up was by no
means a shabby one.
Ii the meantime the crowd outside
was being well entertained by a lot of
sf.ay talent ever eager to make a
si.tech on the glories of socialism. Red
banners and handkerchiefs waved
without as well as within, and none of
those who wended their way to the
scene of action was turned away with
out receiving his fill of eloquence even
though he did not get in on the ground
ftetr.
As the various speakers took their
places and poured forth their tirades
against Russia and oppression the au
dience became more and more vocifer
ous. Frenzied cries and shrieks rent
the air and a babel of many tongues
added to the uproar. Rosenblatt, the
Jewish orator, was the recipient, of a
welcome that completely the
greetings extended to any of his fel
low speakers.
Austin Lewis was the last orator to
raise his voice in defense of socialistic
principles. He began by reviewing the
ritualion in Russia and discussing the
strike there, its causes and results. His
remarks brought out many rounds of
applause. His speech was well worded
and well delivered, though brief.
Arthur M. Lewis was the other ora
tor who spoke in English. His speech
was mut h on the order of his name
sake't. He went as far as to say that
the same trouble might be expected In
San 1- iai cisco that Is now terrorizing
Russia. He compared the strife in the
Czar's frozen empire to the Colorado
mine strike and placed General Bell in
the same class with Nicholas and his
generals.
! HAD HIS POCKET PlCKEDâHerman
â¢ Kruse, 17 Willow avenue, notified Serg ant
! Coogan and Policeman Lycett late Saturday
night at OTarrell street and Grant avenue
that a man had stolen his gold watch. A crowd
' had gathered and Kruse pointed to George A.
Smith as the thief. The officers seized Smith
and on aearching him found the stolen watch
in his pocket. He was taken to the CI y
â  Priron and booked on a charge of grand lar
ceny.
[ LOSES HER DIAMOND JEWELRY.âMiss
i Ella Cecil Ml Belvedere street, was lÂ«i Golden
Gate Park on Saturday aftcrrvon with some
â  friends. They sat on one of tie bench-s ami
! Mie.Â« Cecil Maced her chatelaine, containing
â¢ a diamond breustpin, three diamond rings and
I other jewelry, valued at about *300, < n the
' bench. When they rose to leave the chatelaine
! had disappeared. She suspects some boys
who were playing around the bench. The po
lice were notified
I wardens and vestrymen must render an
accotlnt. These were not to be simply
! figureheads, said the Bishop, but real
j workers, helpers In the upbuilding of
the kingdom of God.
I He told his hearers that it was their
parish and they could no more ex-
I pect others to relieve them of their
' part in working for it and supporting
; It than they could expect others to pay
i the rent of their homes or their house
| hold expenses.
The Bishop then referred to the
i creation of the House of Chruchwomen
I and said that the influence of the house
j could not fail to be far reaching,
j especially on such questions as divorce,
; Sunday desecration and entertain
ments.
The convention, he continued, had
brought it about that the coming year
should be a year of activity in looking
up the thousands of communicants
who have now no church home;
shepherding the flock by pastoral visit
ing, such as had been so faithfully
done in the past by the rector of St.
Paul's parish.
The musical part of the service was
beautifully rendered and after the
service Bishop Nichols complimented
the choirmaster, Wray Taylor, and the
choir on their splendid work. Next
Sunday evening the monthly choral
service will be held.

ORPHEUM SHOW
VERY STRONG
The De Haven Sextet and
3lel)onald Draw a Large
and Delighted Audience
STODDART STILL GREAT
His Finished Art Pleases
at the Grandâ"Little Out
cast" at the California
James Mac Donald and the Carter de
Haven sextet held the center of the
stage and the attention of the audience
last evening at the Orpheum. There
were other clever things, for the Or
pheum seldom fails to be a producer
of good stunts, but a good word for
Mac Donald, who is not unknown to
old stagers as a comedian of comic
opera, is well put at this juncture.
Mac Donald has a voice that is sweet
and well trained, even though it be not
as strong as might be. His selections
are clever and his stories have point
to them that if delivered in blackface
would give promise of a new species
of end man. His songs are not of the
coarse, unmusical kind that are usually
accompanied by a shuffle of feet on a
sanded floor. He will be better liked
when he is better understood.
The Carter de Haven sextet had a
good reception accorded them, even
though they opened a second week s
turn. The sextet is popular and the
public is charitable enough to overlook
any little- defects in <weight and
measure.
"The Great Thereses,". comedy hyp
notic act. "Binns, Binns and Binns."
Cressy and Dayne in a repetition of the
clever sketch "Town Hall . To-night,"
the Gleesons and Fred Houlihan,
bright entertainers with dance and
music, and the Prosper troupe of Eu
ropean acrobatic marvels completed
the excellent programme. It is un
necessary to say that the always
clever Alcide Capitaine was enthusi
astically received in the opening num
ber of the evening as per schedule of
last week.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The years only seem to malu> a
stronger and more impressive Lach
lan Campbell of J. H. Stoddart. The
veteran thrilled the first night crowd
at the Grand Opera-house last night
with his impersonation of the stern,
narrow-minded Scotch father. "He
was built for the part" was the whis
per between the acts.
The company supporting him is just
as flawless as a star could ask. Irma
Pierre as the wronged daughter was
sympathetic and convincing through
out. J. Palmer Collins as Dr. Mc-
Clure divided applause with the star
at times. In the reconciliation scene
he and the veteran touched the heart
strings of the crowd.
W. S. Gill as "Posty," the townpost
man and the town "lush," furnished
most of the comedy of the play.
He handled his rather ponder
ously witty lines to the best
advantages. Sometimes he omitted
to put them in dialect, and this
was a relief. Two remarkably
precocious children. Wilfred and Oli
vette Norman, caught on from tha
start. Edith Talbott as Annie was de
clared "too cute for anything." F.
Elliot Jenkins as the Rev. John Car
michael seemed to catch the notion of
what lan McLaren meant by a Scotch
Free kirk dominie. The part of
Lord Hay was handled for all It was
worth by Carlyle Moore. Louise
Rutter as Kate Carnegie won tha
house with her prettiness.
Rum, crime, conspiracy, love and the
horrid din of arms are promiscuously
mingled In "The Little Outcast," which
was presented for the first time at the
California Theater last night. The audi
ence seemed to enjoy the performance,
and some of the better work was gener
ously applauded.
The play Is a melodrama of the su
perlative degree. A young man Is
robbed of position, wealth and happi
ness by a clever scoundrel. The little
outcast is a newsboy friend of the In
jured man, and finally sees to It that
all are given their just deserts. A little
powder might be spared to the ad
vantage of the play. Dolly Dupree in
the title role is better than the press
agent's account of her. Walter Har
mon. Deltncey Barclay. Harry Rowe,
Harry Morton. Millicent Evans and
Miss L. Whltecliffe also appear well In
Important roles.
Redmen Receive Grand Chief.
Albert Schanf of Bridgeport. Conn.,
grand thief of the order of Indepen
dent. Red Men of the United States, got
a warm reception from the local
members last night at Teutonia Hall,
1322 Howard street. Grand Chief
Schaaf is the only grand officer OT his
rank who has e\'er visited California
in the interest of this order, and as a
consequence his arrival here was made
the occasion of a grand reception by
the representatives of the order, which
number 15.000 in California. His
visit here is with a view to attending
the order's membership into the in
terior towns. Grand Chief Shaaf will
remain in the State for about one
month, visiting the principal cities,
where his labors are likely to be re
warded by adding to the membership
of the order.

TRADE EXHIBIT STILL EXCELLENT.
LAST week was another comparatively quiet and uneventful one
in trade. The weather was bad, a freezing blizzard sweeping
over the major part of the country, checking transportation and
keeping people at home. Distributive trade suffered in consequence.
Still, in spite of this serious interruption, the volume of business,
as indicated by the weekly bank clearances, showed an increase over
the corresponding week last year of 23.3 per cent, and the aggregate
clearings were $2,610,000,000, a very satisfactory showing. Only two
cities of any importanceâNew Orleans and Providenceâshowed a
loss, while several of the largest, notably New York, Chicago, Phila
delphia and Pittsburg, showed substantial gains. The increase of
31.4 per cent at Pittsburg is noteworthy, as showing activity in the
iron and steel trades, reports of which are rather conflicting at the
moment. Bradstreet's reports that the volume of new buying in iron
is light, but current production is above the maximum, while speci
fications are coming out freely. On the other hand, dispatches from
private financial interests, closely associated with the industry, say
that the Homestead mills of the steel corporation will hereafter be
operated day and night seven days in the week, owing to the rush of
orders. This does not show any dullness in new buying.
Another industry, recently lagging badly, seems to be improving.
This is the cotton trade. Accompanying the great decline in raw
cotton as a result of the enormous crop of 1904 was a marked falling
off Â«/ business in the different cotton products, as the manufacturers
Â°andâ heavy wholesale merchants were wary about operating on &
falling market. Advices received during the past three days, how
ever, say that print cloths are now quite active, with a much better
,* demand from Fall River, where the settlement of the great strike is
presumably revigorating the industry.-
Another important line showing improvement is lumber, which,
8 .though recently affected by the blizzard and heavy snows, is said to
be in a strong position statistically, with signs of a healthy reaction
in the Northwest, which for some months sent in poor reports.
Leather, too, continues in active demand and firm, with an excellent
export demand, especially for the Orient, presumably owing to the
Russo-Japanese war. Hides are stiff and active, in consequence of
this demand for leather, and prices have recently advanced. As for
the woolen industry, that is in especially good condition. According
to the latest reports the bulk of the coming clip in the territories has
already been bought up and at higher prices than prevailed last year
at this time, while in California the 1904 clip wholly passed out of
producers' and wholesalers' hands some weeks ago, leaving this
market entirely bare of stock.
Here, then, are four great staplesâiron, lumber, cotton and wool
âshown to be in excellent condition. .There is no depression in corn,
wheat or flour, all of which are reported active. Provisions are the
only important staple showing hesitation, and even in them a
stronger undertone has lately appeared. Sugar and coffee have for
some time exhibited marked strength and activity. "The New Eng
land footwear factories have been sending in excellent reports for
months. With all these leading staples thus strong and active, it is
difficult to figure out any recession in trade. A week ago a certain
lull appeared and attracted some attention, but it has not thus far
increased, and may prove to have been a mere transitory breathing
spell such as suddenly occurs even in periods of pronounced trade ac
tivity.
The money market continues as heretofore. The country is still
charged to the muzzle with funds. We have so much cash to spare
that recent calls upon us by Paris for gold coin cause nothing more
than passing comment. The general remark among the New York
rinancial interests is that if Paris wants gold from us she can have all
she wants. She took several millions last week and intimated that
she needed considerable more. One W%ll street report was that $40,
--000,000 in gold would be taken for this French account within the
next few weeks. The statement produced no effect whatever upon
the market
The New York stock market, which is the most delicate trade
barometer possessed by the country, reflects the current conditions
by continued buoyancy, which nothing seriously disturbs. The talk
in Wall street continues very bullish and expectations regarding the
future are as sanguine as at any time during the past several years.
However, a cautionary note has just been sounded by a noted finan
cier, who says in a circular: J
"There are certain facts to be remembered. Stocks have been
steadily passing from strong into weaker hands, and the big banking
interests are not actively committed to the long side. They believe
that all the strong factors in the situation have been amply dis
counted by present high prices, all the good news about increased
dividends, etc., having been known to them for weeks past. Anti
railroad, anti-trust and anti-tariff agitation do not promote confidence.
The local cliques which are now so successfully manipulating this
market may carry prices to a still higher plane; but there are suffi
cient forces at work to render their success increasingly difficult, if
not precipitating sharp reactions when least expected."
NOW that the large railroads of the country are complaining that
the intervention of an interstate commerce commission in the
regulation of freight rates would bring ruin to their business
and stagnation throughout the whole system of the railroads, it is
not uninstructive to give a casual glance at just what the business of
the railroads represents in cash capital. If the interstate traction
lines are in such a perilous condition financially that the adjudication
of freight rates by a tribunal beyond the province of their operations
would tip the balance in favor of disaster, the figures fail certainly
to give warrant to this fact.
In the last report of the Interstate Commerce Commission on
the survey of the mileage aggregating 209,002 embraced therein
the gross earnings of the railroads were $1,966,633,821; the gross
earnings for the previous year on 205,313 miles were $1,900,846,907.
The average gross earnings per mile of line for the last year were
$9410, an increase over that of 1903 of $152 and higher than the cor
responding average for any previous year since 1887. The ratio of
operating expenses to earnings for the last year was 67.75 P er cent.
The dividends declared by the several roads for 1904 were higher
than those of the previous period by $23,594,139.
It seems from the commission's report that of gross earnings per
mile on all railroads throughout the country $2581 were assignable
to the passenger service and $6592 to the freight service. It is not
difficult to see where the milk lies in the cocoanut for those railroads
that protest against "wrongful usurpation of power" on the part of
the Interstate Commerce Commission. The question still remains:
With a record of prosperous business such as that set forth by the
commission's report, will a legal curtailing of the railroad's exclusive
dictation of freight rates effect such tremendous havoc as prophesied
by the stock-owning seers?

Senator Dubois of Idaho was coming
1 down the street from his house this
morning when he ran across a bunch
ot little boys and girls who were deep
! ly interested in a game they were play-
I Ing, says the Washington ccrrespond-
I ent of the New York World.
Nine or ten of the children were
parading around, with drums beating
and flags flying, and a disconsolate lit
tle chap stood on the curb, trying hard
to keep his tears back.
"What's the matter?" asked the
Senator of the little fellow on the curb.
"Oh," he replied, between sniffs,
"we're playing politics."
"Playing politics, eh?" sdid the Sen
ator. "Well, why don't you play with
the others?"
"I am playing," sobbed the boy,
"but I'm the Democrat."

HERR AND FRAU LUDWIG.
Papa Ludwig's 55 50 per week still has
to provide for nineteen hungry mouths.
The married girls do domestic work in
outside families and bring home a few
marks a week, and Mother Ludwig
until now has found.it possible to earn
extra money by sewing, but the birth
of her last baby, a few weeks ago,
brought on an attack of semi-blindness
which has incapacitated her for any
thing but taking care of her brood.
Barring her eye complaint, she is in
splendid health, and until now has
never experienced ill effects of any
kind from her strenuous motherhood.
All her children living are healthy and
sound. The money raised by the news
paper subscription is being paid out
to the family in weekly sums, and
enough has been contributed to insure
them a tidy income for many weeks
to come.
Paul Rothe and wife, workpeople in
the suburb of -Sehmargendorf-Berlin,
had their eighteenth child, a strapping
baby boy, in October. Thirteen of
their children still live. The record for
male children in Germany is held by a
worthy shopkeeper couple named Ho

teen big boys living. Four children
have died, two girls and two boys.
Seven of the boys are in the army.

WHY, OF COURSE.
SHORT, ARE YOU? WELL
MR. WILLIAMS CAN
MAKE YOU TALL.
The Bertlllon system has received a
â ad blow in the demonstration of the
fact that a person may, to a very great
extent, change his physical proportions.
Postal Inspector William Williams, at
tached to the Denver postoffice, has
taken it on himself to show how this
could be done, and some time ago ha
subjected himself to an examination
and then started in on a systematic
scheme for the purpose of bringing
about such changes in his general
shape and appearance as to make it
difficult to Identify him by the meas
urements previously made by the Ber
tlllon system, which were thought to
be infallible, says the Philadelphia
Record.
At the time of the first examination
Mr. Williams weighed 190 pounds and
measured five feet two Inchest and
after going through a somewhat pro
longed course of training he weighed
160 pounds and measured five feet four
Inches In height. The system of physi
cal culture taken up by Mr. Williams
In his experiment was that of loosen
ing the bones in their sockets and al
lowing the space where they were
pulled aoart at the joints to fill with
cartilage. By this method the body is
lengthened without overdevelopment of
the muscles, such as is the case in
physical training adopted by athletes.
Then, in order to effectually prove his
ground that the system was
â¢worthless, Williams submitted himself
to arrest In several different cities
where the system was made use of in
the identification of criminals, and in
no case was he recognized by the orig
inal record. The ability to increase the
height was the one thing which *broke
down the certainty of the Bertlllon sys
tem.
An apparatus to produce this in
creased height was recently awarded a
patent. In a few words, the subject Is
placed on a- sort of a rack, with the
head and feet securely fastened, and by
the application of a screw the subject
is literally stretched. By undergoing
this operation at regular intervals it is
said to be possible to make even great
er additions to the. height than Mr.
Williams succeeded in doing.
A tIHI
Do you remember, little wife.
How years ago we two together
Saw naught but love illumine life *
In sunny days or wintry weather?
Do you remember how we two
Would stare into each other's eyes,
Till all the earth grew heavenly blue,
And speech was lost in happy sighs?
Do you another thing recall.
That used to happen often then,
How, simply passing in the hall,
We'd stop to smile and kiss again?
Do you remember how I sat
And, reading, held your hand in mine,
Caressing it with gentle patâ
One pat for every blessed line?
Do you, recall While at the play
Through hours of agony we taraied?
The lovers' griefs brought us dismay;
Oh, we rejoiced when they were mar
ried.
Ah. me! 'twas years and years agb
When all this happened that I sing,
And many a time the winter snow
Has slipped from olive slopes of
Spring.
And nowâoh, nonsense! let us tell;
A fig for laugh of maids or men;
You'll hide your blushes? I'll not. Wellâ
We're ten times worse than we were
then.

CONSPICUOUS TYPES
OF LOVE
DOROTHY FEN IMORE
I HAVE been asked to discuss the
1 question, "Is it possible for sin
| and death to follow in the wake
of love?"
To-day I shall touch the matter
lightly, though I must confess that I
regard the subject as worth consid
ering, chiefly because it gives a chance
to point out that its valve to us is a
negative one.
I believe that we should keep love
before our minds as the noblest in
spiration that the world holds. What
ever our sorrows on this earth may
be it is love that carries us through,
them. The tendency of love is to
uplift us, and not to drag us down.
We cannot live worthily without it;
It is' an imperative need of our na
tures. *
"What is the beginning? Love, What
the course? Love still.
What the goal? The goal is Love on
the happy /till.
Is there nothing, then, hut Love,
search we sky or earth?
There is nothing out of Love hath
perpetual worth."
So says Christina Rossetti, and her
words ring true to me, after my seri
ous study of men and women, and
love and loving.
SUNFLOWER PHILOSOPHY.
The easier people make money the
easier they want to make It.
Among the many mysteries of child
hood is why grown people cry when
they are glad.

tions as have continuous lines from
one State to another, either by land
or water, or both.
PRESIDENTSâA. L. S., City. Of
those who have been Presidents of the
United States, seven were born In Vir
ginia, five in Ohio, three in North
Carolina, three in rAw York, two In
Massachusetts and one in each of the
following States: New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Vermont and
New Jersey. A question has been
raised as to the State in which An
drew Jackson was born. His bio
grapher, Kendell, recorded Lancaster
County, South Carolina, but Parton
a hot One.
Miss AntiqueâNo; Tom didn't blow
his brains out because you threw him
over. He proposed to me the next day.
Miss CaustlqueâDid he? Then he
must have got rid of his brains in
some other way.
And when I sit down to contemplate
love's relation with sin and death, the
following- story Alls my mind and col
ors m*y reflections:
One time, when the author of "se
same and Lilies'* and "Queens' Gar
dens" was walking In a London thor
oughfare, a friend who was with him
exclaimed as he looked at the mud in
the street: "What dirty, disgraceful,
disgusting stuff."
"Yet," said Ruskin In reply, "this
mud is partly sand, which under suit
able conditions may form the opal.
And there Is clay in It, too; and the
materials of clay, when the particle
are arranged according to their'high
er laws, make the brilliant sapphire.
And there is soot also in this mud,
and soot, in its crystallized perfec
tion, forms the diamond. And the
last element, water, when distilled ac
cording to the higher law of nature,
forms the dewdrop resting in exquisite
perfection In the heart of the rose."
Just so It Is in lives where love ap
pears to be a common thing. Unlovely
as It may look In its environment and
put to Its present use, still it may hold
In It the element of beauty. And in
that very moment in which you appre
ciate the pity of the situation you real
ize what hope there Is within it. For
love, as we know it between the sexes,
while It is Indeed "chemical affinity
based on physical attraction." Is some
thing mora than such a definition of it
indicates.
Grant Allen calls "fallin* in love" an
inherited instinct with an upward ten
dency, which is shown by the fact that
beauty, strength and health are its mag
nets. Young people, he says, If left to
themselves would fall in love with their
natural complements, with those who
are strong on points where they them
selves are weak, and vice versa
The basis of human love is neither
wholly physical, wholly Intellectual nor
wholly spiritual. It is a combination of
these three elements, and sometimes
one of them predominates, sometimes
another. Historically we have four
conspicuous types of love âthe over
whelming passion which marked the
love story of Tristan and Isolde; the
purely platonlo love, like that which
existed between Michael Angelo and
VUtoria Colonna; the idealistic vision
of a Dante, and the well-balanced af
fection of a happy modern marriage.
Love has Its mortal and Its immortal
aspect, just as life haa. And to our un
derstanding neither one of these is ab
solutely' cut off from the, other. The
mortal puts on some degree of Immor
tality, and Immortality carries with it
ssociations of the mortal.

A week from to-day the delegates
to the State Federation of Women's

Angeles, choosing to go by the day
light coast route, that the beauties of a
California winter be not missed in
travel by night
And there promises to be good fun
on that all-day trip!âwith a headache
or two thrown in, although be it said
to the eternal credit of clubs that
they are lessening women's proneness
to headaches and vapors and hysterics
by giving women something Impersonal
and Interesting to think about. It's a
perfectly logical treatment for "nerves"
âlest indeed It be carried to excess.
But who ever heard of women going to
excess? Absurd!
As to the details of the trip, the
tickets can be purchased to-day at the
Southern Pacific Railroad office, where
they will be on sale until the 6th
These will hold good to return until
February 20âand the $15 rate prevails.
All who desire to go south at this rate
should communicate at once with Mrs.

Fine!
Again the blessed privilege of woman
has been made available, for the hosts
have changed their minds about hold
ing the meeting In the Woman's Club
building, and have substituted Simpson
Auditorium instead. Remember, Simp
son Auditorium!
The reason? Presumably to accom
modate more peopleâvisitors, perhaps,
who like to see women at work in con
vention. It is sincerely to be hoped
that the women who will read papers
or give reports can send their voices to
the ears of their auditors.
Thin, squeaky, inaudible voices have
been the wet blankets of former club
rendezvous, and this in comparatively
small halls.
Just how the feminine voices will fill
the big auditorium remains to be
heard. But in any case, may the gods
grant us brief speeches and compact
reports, with unnecessary, unimportant
and uninteresting details omitted. Since
women have for centuries been trained
to petty details, it's an awful wrench
to get away from the habit.
But the clubs are helping. During
the three days' convention there will
be nine sessions, only one of which is
of a purely social character âthe recep
tion on Tuesday night, which, I am
told, will be very smart.

Will some one solve the reason why
makers of club programmes insist upon
having two or three papers and then j
supplement themâand often they're
pretty dull âwith a half-dozen musical
numbers, which they follow out to the
bitter end?
I have before me Just such a pro
gramme. Three papersâall on abstruse
subjects and, of course, encyclopedic
and more or less pedanticâand six
musical numbers.
What club?
Not this time. We shall watch the
next affair.

SOCIAL LIFE VERY
INTERESTING.
HOME AFFAIRS LEAD THE WEEK
Engagements and Weddings
Are Least in Evidence.
Slowly the Intensity of entertainment
is abating. While there is no lack of
events and gayety, social affairs are
adjusting themselves more evenly.
There are moments to breathe between
teas, luncheons and cards for the first
time in weeks, and the pleasure is no
less in consequence. The only signs of
sloth are in Cupid's domain âhe must
actually be accused of laziness, but so
long a breathing spell for him- fore
bodes an abundant harvest.

NEW BUREAU
OF STANDARDS
Established at the National
Capital by the Department
of Commerce and Labor
DEVOTED TO PRECISION
Will Be Our Supreme Court
on Questions of Accuracy
of Weights and Measures
To better Insure that hia people will
get what they pay for, Uncle Sam has
just built on the outskirts of Washing
ton a scientific Institution costing a
half million dollars. It will be formally
opened early in the autumn, but its
| good work has already commenced, and j
1 its benefits are already being felt. It Is j
J known as the National Bureau of i
j Standards, and it is a part of the new j
! Department of Commerce and Labor, j
j organized by Secretary Cortelyou. The j
l director of this bureau is Professor j
: Samuel W. Stratton, a well-known edu- |
! cator and physi A ;t, who was a lieuten- I
| ant in the navy during the Spanish- i
i American war, and who held the chair I
j of physics in the University of Chicago !
I just prior to his organization of the |
new institution over which he presides, j
ARTIFICIAL CLIMATE.
I was the guest of Professor Stratton
recently and was taken on a person- j
ally conducted tour through the new I
bureau. It Is located in the midst df a |
grove of trees a few miles northwest of 1
the capital, and was purposely thus, i
isolated that the jarring of heavy traf
fic and the powerful electric currents |
jof the city might not interfere with its j
j delicate and precise measuring lnstru- |
ments. It is an institution devoted en
tirely to precision, which to-day is the !
1 basis of all industry. It comprises two i
j handsome buildings of stone and hand
made brick, whose rooms will be artl- i
flcially cooled in summer and heated in 1
winter. The windows will be down the
year round, and yet the pure atmos
phere within will be maintained always |
at a comfortable and constant temper- 1
ature, between 70 and 75 degrees. This
precaution will be taken to further in- j
J sure the accuracy of the instruments,
j sensitiveness to fickleness of weather,
i In the artificial climate of these apart
j ments will work seventy-five men, fifty
iof them experts who have been gradu- |
i ated from technical and scientific lnstl- I
| tutions.
This new bureau will be our supreme :â 
j court of weights and measures. If you
j will consider for a moment you will I
! realize that there is no subject in which
j people are more directly interested
I than in that of weighing or measuring.
I The prosperity of all who buy or sell ;
; depends upon the accuracy of these
processes.
STANDARDS OF MEASURES.
A representative of each measure and
each weight commonly used in the i
country will be installed in the bureau
and these will stand as "the" stand- I
ards with which all good weights and
measures must favorably compare*. \
| Such standards will not be arbitrarily j
j selected. They will be chosen only '
j after the most careful research, which |
I will comprise a large part of the work \
|of the half hundred of scientists em- j
j ployed. Many or these standards have j
already been selected. I will tell you j
about those used to correct the weights
and measures most important to our j
every day life.
First I will describe the standard of \
length measure, by which all true foot- j
rules, yard-sticks, meter-sticks, etc.,
are to be corrected. This is one of the
older pieces of the laboratory's equip- j
ment and its history should be known i
by every one in the country. In 1875 I
the principal countries of the world, j
including our own, sent to Paris repre- |
sentatives -charged with agreeing upon j
jan international meter and kilogram, j
I which are, respectively, units of length
and weight adopted originally by j
France, but since used by scientists all J
over the world. Two of these meters i
and kilograms were made for each
country and they were drawn by lot. |
In 1893 the Secretary of the Treasury
adopted those drawn by our repre- j
sentative as our fundamental standards
of length and weight and our yards
aad pounds are compared with them. J
One set of these standards has always j
been stored away, while another has |
been used for comparisons. They were ',
formerly kept In the Coast Survey
Bureau, but have now been removed
to the Bureau of Standards.
ACCURATE WORK.
The length standard Is a bar of plati
num alloy whose cross-section is X
shaped. It and its duplicate cost $2500
apiece. It is kept inclosed In plush in
a japanned cylinder of tin, which in
turn is incased In a long wooden box.
When a measuring rod is to be com
pared with this standard the two are
placed side by side In a clamp, over
each end of which is a telescope.
Through these magnifiers the gradua
tions on the two are compared with an
exactitude more than hair-splitting. A
correct yard must measure 3600-3937 of
the standard meter.
The weight standard is a small cylln-'
der of the same metal used In the me
ter rod. It and its duplicate cost $1000
apiece, and each Is kept under two
glass bell Jars, one fitting over the oth
er, which protect the precious weight
from dust. The kilogram used for
actual comparisonâIts companion be
ing always stored awayâis handled
only with forceps having chamois skin
ends. The naked hand is never allowed
to touch It. When a weight is to be
I standardized it is taken into an equal i
| temperature room and placed In one
I pan of a delicate weighing scale, the ;
j standard kilogram resting on the other, i
j The scale is under glass and the two j
| weights are allowed to rest in their j
| pans over night that their temperature
| may be kept equal. All manipulations;
iof this balance are made at a distance
of fourteen feet by means of long brass '<
rods. Should a person approach nearer |
to this delicate scale the heat of his ,
body might alter its equilibrium. The j
i delicately graduated indicator dial of j
j the scale Is read through a telescope-

JANES LOSES
TENNIS MATCH
California Club Expert Is
Defeated by A. Brabant
in a Park Tournament
Despite the fact that the handicaps
looked small on paper there were a
number of surprises yesterday on the
Golden Gate Park tennis courts. The
handicap singles tournament, which
was twice postponed on account of rain,
was finally started. All the preliminary
and first rounds and a part of the sec
ond round were played.
Several of the players who were be
low "scratch" and who looked to have
an excellent chance to win were retired
in the early rounds. The biggest sur
prises by far were the defeat of George
Janes and Clarence Griffin. It was not
so much the defeat of the latter that oc
casioned surprise as the easy way in
which Charles Foley disposed of him.
Foley at ail times would be conceded a
Â£ood chance to win, but the fact that
Griffin lost In straight sets was quite a
shock.
George Janes, the young player who
has been winning everything at the
California Club, lost to A. Brabant.
Janes allowed owe odds of 3-6, and the
way he has been playing of late Bra
bant hardly looked to have a chance.
Janes' long string of victories undoubt
edly made him somewhat nervous. Bra,
bant is at all times a hard man to beat,
and he won by the narrowest of mar
gins from his opponent. Janes' defeat
proves he has bad considerable luck in
the California Club tournaments. It
also proves a decided lack of class at
the latter club.
M. Long and H. Gabriel both won
their matches and will not be far off
when the prizes are distributed. H.
Long and G. Baker were also success
ful.
Captain Jewell, a crack player from
the Presidio, caused quite a surprise by
heating Foley. The latter allowed odds
of "owe 15" and give "3-6." Foley won
the first set, but the captain won t he
next two easily. The scores follow:

Each recurring Â«eason the friends of
Walter's. Hobarf sympathize with him
on his increasing avoirdupois on the
ground that it will end his remarkable
career as a polo player. Early this sea
son it was thought he was out of it, but
Instead he has played some sensational
games.
He won the game for the Whites on
the field of the Burlingame Country
Club yesterday, playing the last two
periods of the game with marked dash
and brilliancy. There had been consid
erable bumping and rough riding
throughout the game, and when Mr.
Hobart on his big ponies took a hand
the others were willing to cease hos
tilities. The Whites, on which team
Mr. Hobart played number three posi
tion, won by a score of eight goals to
five. The teams lined up:
WhitesâSir George Prescott. F. C. J. Men
zies. W. B. Hobart. John Lawson.
RedsâPaul Gladstone, Cyril Tobln, R. M.
Tobln, Captain de Crespigny.
Referee âLawrence McCreery.
In the fifth period there was a colli
sion, in which Cyril Tobin was thrown
heavily on his shoulder. The ponies
were all stopped in their stride and the
plucky player was again in the saddle
in a moment and the game went mer
rily on as though nothing had hap
pened.
Cowing to the recent rains the field
was not at its best, being cuppy, and
the ball would not roll truly.
The Reds started off with a rush, scor
ing a goal in the first and another in
the second period. Sir George Prescott,
the English player, broke the ice for
the Whites in the third period, scoring
two goals for his team. R. M. Tobin
scored for the' Reds, leaving them still
one in the lead. Cyril Tobin scored for
the Reds and Menzies for the Whites in
the fourth period.
R. M. Tobin gave the Reds what
seemed a safe lead in the fifth by scor
ing early in the period. Shortly after
this the Whites claimed a foul and were
allowed a free stroke at goal. Sir
George Prescott placed the ball square
ly between the posts. He secured the
ball again shortly afterward and ran it
across the field, placing it for Walter
Hobart, who scored a goal, which tied
the score.
The Whites played brilliantly in the
last period, scoring three goals in rapid
succession. Walter Hobart was credit
ed with two of these and Menzies with
one.
A large gallery witnessed the game,
which wsb played in a snappy manner
throughout. There were no delays be
tween periods and the referee had but
few decisions to render. The game was
for a set of valuable silver cups.

a tie match at Idora Park and the In

Early in the first period Robertson
kicked a real for the Vampires and
there being no further score, the record
at half time read: Vampires, 1; Pick
wicks, 0. In the second period the
Vampires pressed the Pickwicks and
made several shots at goal, but none
went between the posts. Early in the
second period Krauskopp, of the Pick
wicks, wrenched his knee and had to
retire from the game.
The Pickwicks, though playing with
only four forwards, kept on even terms
with the Vampires and at last Robert
son equalized the score with a good
kick. Rolfe made a poor attempt to
save and the game ended in a t*ie:
Vampires, 1 goal; Pickwicks, 1 goal.

Precise in His Petition.
The Kansas City Star tells of a Kan
sas clergyman who prided himself on
his precise and scrupulous use of
words. One Sunday this good man was
praying for elevated grace and renewed
working force. "O Lord," he pleaded,
"waken thy cause in the heasts of this
congregation and give them new eyes
to see and Impulse to do. Send down
thy lev-er oÂ»* leev-er, according to Web
ster's or Worcester's dictionary, which
ever you choose, and pry them into ac
tivity." ,
The man who was born great may
not die that way.

MINIATURE YACHTS SAIL
ON SPRECKELS LAKE WATERS
Stiff Breeze Furnishes Pastime for a
Large Number of Enthusiasts
at the Park.
For the first time in many weeks
the model yachtsmen were able to in
dulge in their favorite pastime yes
terday on Spreckels Lake. Golden
Gate Park. A stiff breeze blew all day
and the owners of the miniature boats
enjoyed one of the best day's pastime
since the opening of the new lake. A
race for second class models was
scheduled, but only three boats in
this class were â¢ present. It was then
decided to hold races for first-class
boats, but a lack of timekeepers and
other officials made this out of the
question. v
Numerous impromptu races were
then held and some fast time was
made. The most prominent models
were: L. H. Petersen's Stella, J.
Brannon's Alice, H. London's Imp
and M. London's Cricket. The Stella
is a new boat. This was her first
trial since being officially measured.
She surprised her owner by winning
six of the practice races. The other
three boats mentioned won several
races each.
Johnson's Spreckels, a comparitive
ly new boat, did not do as well as
usual. Her sails were unsuited to the
stiff wind prevailing. W. Roeckher's
crack boat, Apache, was another that
did not seem able to do herself jus
tice. Her owner withdrew her early
in the game.

quarters to catch a glimpse of the
boxers,
The training camp at the beach al
ways attracts a big crowd on tha Sun
day before a fight, and the number of
people there yesterday will compare
favorably with the attendance on any
previous occasion. Hyland did no work
in the gymnasium, his exercise con
sisting of an eight-mile Jaunt on the
road to Ingleside. He was accom
panied by Dave Sullivan, the sprinter,
and by Joe Angeli, who will appear in
one of the preliminary bouts to-morrow
night.
On the return of the party from the
road they took a dip in the ocean, a
big crowd 'watching their antics in the
surf. When Hyland was weighed the
beam Just moved when the weights
showed 122 pounds.
Hyland is supremely confident of his
ability to defeat Neil. He tells hia
intimates he Is not afraid of the hard

seen him fight and knows what to ex

ceiving admiring friends. It was the 3
first day during Frankie's siege ofâ
training for Hyland that he spent a '
few leisure hours. For nearly a month
he has been constantly grinding and
his present condition is the reward of
industrious work. He Is pronounced""
In the best possible form and could not
be better if he were made to order.
Trainer McDonald deserves a great
deal of credit for rounding Neil into
shape. He has watched every move Â£
made by the bantam during the past
three weeks and has guarded him
against a setback of any kind.
' In the morning Neil took a sprint to jj
San Anselmo and return, a distance of
four miles. He returned in a health
perspiration, but his breathing was not 'â 
visibly affected.
About half an hour was spent in the
gymnasium in the afternoon, half of
the time being devoted to bag punch
ing. Frank will take a little exercise
this morning and will leave camp on
an afternoon train for this city. In
the evening he will attend one of the
theaters in order to take his attention
off his engagement to-morrow night. -
He will sleep at home to-night and
will take a complete rest to-morrow
with the expectation of gaining in
weight and in vitality. Like Hyland
he is confident he will be returned the
winner.
HOW THE EDITOR BEAT
LIFE INSURANCE AGENT
Offered $100 to Have Scheme Ex-
plained in Readable Article,
Agent Gave Up.
There are to-day some thousands of
varieties of life insurance policies, each
of which has a technical name and is
capable of being made quite unintellig
ible to the average man. Some un
scrupulous agents trade on this; many
do not really understand the meaning
of the terms themselves, but have
learned their lesson parrot-like, and
most of them apparently find it unnec
essary to describe in plain English to '"
those about to insure what they are _
contracting for. The result is a mass M
of misinformation and confusion about
the whole subject.
For instance, an agent was trying to
insure an editor on some new plan.
The editor had a theory that any fact
could be put into plain, everyday Eng
lish, if the man behind the fact really
knew what he was talking about.
After listening to an involved flow of
"premiums," "deferred dividends,"
"cash surrender values" and "optional
choices," he said gravely:
"See here; I don't understand what
you're talking about But I'll tell you
what I'll do. If you'll write that prop
osition out in ordinary English, so that
an ordinary man can understand it I'll
tiot only take the policy, but I'll pub
lish the explanation as an article and
pay you a hundred dollars for it."
"Will I? Sure I will," exclaimed the
overjoyed agent, thinking he had in
deed struck an easy Job. And he de
parted, adjuring the editor not to for
get.
A week passed by. The agent called
up on the telephone to say that he was
working on the thing. There was less
exultation in his voice.
Two weeks more elapsed. The editor
had forgotten the whole thing when
the agent's card came in one day. It
was followed by the man himself.
"Well," said the edkor, "got my
article?"
"N-no," said the agent, sheepishly.
"The fact is, I guess, I can't do it the
way you want it after all. Let's call it
off."
It is hardly too much to say; that this
is typical.âNew York Tribune.
One Hundred Mile Auto Race To-Day.
ORMOND, Fla., Jan. 29.âIdeal
weather prevailed to-day and every
car in the city was pressed into ser
vice for a spin on the roads. The 100
--mile race for the W. K. Vanderbilt Jr\
trophy will be the great event for
Monday.
An account in a savings bank is an
interesting thing.

ONE SERIOUSLY HURT
Mrs. J. Rhodes Receives
Internal Injuries and Is
Hysterical From Shock
Three women were hurled from car
1017 of the Sacramento street line as
it rounded the. curve at First avenue
and Sacramento street yesterday. Only
one of them was dangerously hurt, Mrs.
J. Rhodes of 1821 Greenwich street.
She was taken to the Children's Hos
pital,- where it was found that her
shoulder was badly contused. There
were also internal Injuries.
The other women, Miss A. Smith and
Miss .Kate Smith, though badly shaken
up, were able to go to their homes
without assistance. Miss Kate Smith
received some ugly lacerations about
the head and face, but the other woman
escaped with some painful bruises.
The car was crowded at the time, and
on the down grade the gripman seemed
to lose control'of it. It swirled round
the curve with great rapidity, throw
ing the women, who were seated on the
dummy, into the street.
The accident caused a panic inside
the car. Women and children rushed
to the doors and some of them were
kept from jumping from the moving
car only with great difficulty.
* Besides her bruises Mrs. Rhodes suf
fered greatly from shock. She became
hysterical from pain and fright at the
hospital. Later she rested easily. That
the three women were not more se
riously hurt seems miraculous. Pas
sengers on the car declare that Its
speed was terrific.

The cars will be placed in service aa j

by the overland trains. Among the j
stations that will be seriously affected '
are Willows, Dunsmuir, Ashland and j

not severe injuries. O'Keefe is in the
City Prison, pending an investigation,
and Duke is at his home, 1227 Ellis
street, resting comfortably, though
weak from the loss of blood and the
reaction attendant upon his exciting
experience.
There were women in the case, but
they were innocent of being an in
centive for the attack, beyond that
which was evolved in the brain of a
man crazed with excessive drinic. An
imaginary wrong stirred O'Keefe to
action, but when the effects of the
alcohol wore off there was no more
repentant man than he. He told Cap
tain of Detectives Burnett that Duke
had been his best friend and that the
attack on the captain was the result
of liquor and irresponsibility. He had
been drinking heavily during the after
boon and evening and when he re
turned he made trouble for an invalid
sister, Miss Mamie O'Keefe, and for a
Miss Emily Andrews, who is a roomer
at the Ellis-street house.
Captain Duke told his story of the
affair as follows:
Saturday afternoon I met Zed Kendall of
Tonopah, who Ib a friend of Mrs. O'Keefe'*,
and her elder son. who are now at the mining
camp. Kendall brought tidings Irom the ab
sent ones and I made up a theater party for
Saturday evening with the object of enter
taining him. There were Misses Annie and
Ella O'Keefe, *Ir. Kendall and myself in the
party. We went to a theater and afterward
to Techau's for supper. It was about 1 o'clock
whfn we returned.
During our absence young O'Keefe came in,
much under the influence of liquor, and pro
ceeded to make life miserable for Miss Ella
Andrews, a roomer, and Miss Mamie, the
Invalid Miss O'Keefe. When our party re
turned we found Miss Andrews in hysterics
and Miss Mamie on the point of collapse.
They were in Miss Andrews' room. I closed
the door and some one locked it. . The women
worked over Miss Andrews, who was In a bad
way. In the meantime young O'Keefe was
making a demonstration on the outside of thu
door and demanding admittance.
I suggested that we open the doof and talk
with the boy. I turned the key and threw
the door open.
In an instant young O'Keefe came at me
with an open pocketknlfe. He struck at me
four times, each blow taking effect, but three
of them struck the ribs and did little harm.
The fourth thrust went deep and severed a
small artery. I could feel that I was losing
strength and. summoning all of my remaining
force, I struggled with O'Keefe toward the
bed and reached for my handcuffs. He made
several desperate passes at me with the knife
and I caught ths blade with my right hand,
cutting two of my fingers to the bone. He
tried to cut tbe women, but .was prevented. â¢
I was growing fajnt and would have been
out of commission In a few moments had not
O'Keefe made a break for the door and run
from the house to Ellis street, thence down
Buchanan, where he was caught by Policeman
Quarrels.
When the boy was brought back to the house
and saw my condition he broke down, cried
and asked my pardon. I sent f"r Dr. Shumate,
who treated my wounds and announced that I
had had a very narrow escape from death, as
the fourth stab had oome within a quarter of
an Jnch of my heart.
Miss Emily Andrews, who has
roomed with the O'Keefes for a long
time, says that young t O'Keefe made
himself obnoxious to her. He kept up
hia attentions until the invalid Miss
O'Keefe remonstrated with him and
tried to get him to bed. The theater
party returned and Captain Duke, who
has always been a friend to the young
man, tried to quiet him, but the boy
was abusive and so overcome with
liquor that he was not aware of what
he was doing. Then followed the
scene described by Captain Duke in
his interview.
Miss Ella and Miss Annie O'Keefe
explained that their brother is a boy
Of good character and kind feelings,
but when he is in his cups he becomes
utterly irresponsible and troublesome. J
They said that during the struggle In
Miss Andrews* room their brother
made desperate efforts to cut them.
At the City Prison yesterday morn
ing O'Keefe exonerated Captain Duke
of all blame for the trouble. He said
the captain was his good friend and
that he could scarce realize that he
had so far forgot himself as to at
; tempt life. He asked about the In
j valid's condition and was much re
! lieved when he- heard that the patient
> was not in any immediate danger.
Captain Duke has ben rooming with
j the family for several months.
The effect on the digestive organs
after using: Lash's Kidney and Liver
Bitters is truly wonderful. â¢

JANITOR TELLS
A WEIRD STORY
John Barwick Says He Was
Tied and Gagged by Four'
or Five Masked Robbers^
THEIR ATTEMPT FUTILE!
Proprietor of St Germain;
Restaurant Unexpectedly j
Returns and Men Escape
According- to John Barwick, Janitor
|at the St. Germain restaurant, 33
O'Farrell street, a bold attempt to rob
! the restaurant early yesterday morning
iby four or five masked men was frus
trated by the unexpected return of
Germain Pouchan, one of the proprie
tors. Pouchan had forgotten to take a
package with him, and shortly after 3
o'clock rang the bell at the entrance of
I the restaurant. Not receiving an an
| swer, he thought something was wrong
and notified Policemen Reihl and Orr.
The policemen entered the restaurant
j through the door In the basement,
I which was open, and on going upstairs
found Barwick lying on the floor of the
pantry with his hands tied behind his
â  back and a handkerchief tied over his
j face. He was cut loose, whereupon he
told a weird story.
J He said four or five men with hand
| kerchiefs tied over their faces entered
j the restaurant and seized him. They
| tied his hands behind his back and
j asked him where the proprietors kept
| their money. He replied that he did not
j know. They tied a handkerchief over !
! his mouth and carried him down to the
basement, where they put him in an
ice chest. He was kept there for a few
minutes and was taken out. His legs
j were tied and he was carried upstairs,
j The cord around his legs was cut and
;he was locked in the pantry. Just then
the bell rang and the men disappeared.
The officers closely questioned Bar
wick, but he stuck to his story. They
doubted it for several reasons. A hand
; kerchief had been placed over his wrists
i and the cord with which he was bound
j had been wound over the handkerclef,
Iso that it would not hurt him. It was
|an ordinary piece of twine. They also ,
! say that be could have worked his
| hands loose, and there was no occasion .
| for his lying on the floor of the pantry, '
jas he could have got on his feet and
i when the bell rang he could have
j kicked the door of the pantry open.
I Nothing had been disturbed in the res- j
! taurant.

Two Men Hold Up and Rob
David H. Blake Within
Call of Police Station
Two men who appear to have been
operating repeatedly in the ivcinity of
Grove and Franklin streets held up
and robbed David H. Blake of 422%
Grove street late Saturday night near
the City Hall. The robbers, who are
described by Blake as a tall and a
short man, took $60 from their victim
and leisurely walked away.
According to Blake's story he was
walking down Grove street, between
Larkin and Polk, within earshot of the
City Hall police station, and was pass
ing the high fence of the Harrison
Primary School, on the north side of
the street, when two men stepped from
an angle in the fence and commanded
him to hold up his hands. The short j
man held a revolver and backed Blake
to the fence, while the other searched j
him. The footpads robbed him of three
$20 gold pieces, overlooking $1 50 in an
inside pocket. Upon the completion of
the search he was warned not to make
an outcry, and the thieves then walked
leisurely along Grove street, turning
into Polk, where they were lost to their
victim's view.
Blake gives a fair description of his
plunderers, describing the short man
to be about five feet seven Inches in
height, broad shouldered and smooth
faced. He wore a black derby hat and
light trousers. The other was about
five feet nine inches high, slim built,
round shouldered and smooth face. He
wore a dark suit and a fedora hat.
The description of the men tallies
with that which the police have of
the two masked rabbers who robbed
Jules Disler's saloon at Oak and Grove
streets last Friday morning.
Coalpasser Asphyxiated.
J. Semllnger. a coalpasser on the
trrpedo-boat Perry, was found dead

Mrs. A. Burger, the landlady, lit the
gas for him and left. Yesterday morn
ing she detected the odor of escaping
gas and on entering the room found
Semlinger dead. All the windows were
closed. Death is supposed to have
been accidental.

A man who registered as D. C. Jones

to be the motive for the deed. The
; bcdy was removed to the Morgue. The
i man was a little past middle age,and
| had evidently bt'on poorly nourished
or ill for some time.
