PARIS, March 20.â Announcement of
a. remarkable coup attempted by Pres
ident Castro of Venezuelaâ that
â Rill demand the immediate attention
cl the United States and French gov
ernmentsâwas made here to-day. In
cidentally it is likely to lead to some
lively diplomatic exchanges between
"Washington and the German and Brit
ish capitals.
General Antonio Belutini, President
Castro's financial agent at Antwerp,
has been authorized to sign a contract
with the German and British br'ders
of Venezuelan bonds pledgi*" fper
cent of the customs receipts *Â± v Inta
Jt Vela, Cumana. Cuidad Bolivar, Porto
Colon and Oarupino to pay 526,000,000,
bearing interest at the rate of 4 per
cent per annum, until other creditor
nations are paid from 30 per cent of the
customs of La Guayra and Porto Ca
bello, after which those two ports shall
pay 25 per cent of their total receipts
to Great Britain and Germany.
It is estimated that Germany" and
Great Britain will get a preponderating
influence over Venezuela for fifty years
&r.d continue their alliance.
It is reported that President Castro
receives a gift of $2,600,000 in consid
eration of this arrangement.
The effect of this action by the Castro
regime an be readily understood. He
will make allies of Great Britain and
Germany, who will not be disposed to
relinquish the advantage gained -for;
their subjects who are creditors ~bT"lne

the other creditor nations, including
the United States, should they quietly
submit, must undergo the humiliation?

BOISE. Idaho, March 20.â Rendered
insane by worry over her school teach
ing. Miss Ida Roberts used a revolver
to comrÂ»el her sick si3ter to arise from
her bed, then captured the 8-year-old
daughter of the family with whom she
was boarding, forced the child, the
young woman and another woman into
a carriage, and at the point of the re
volver rode fourteen miles before her
frenzy refaxed.
This happened at Silver City, a re
mote town, the other day. The little
girl's mother entered the room just
after Miss Roberts had displayed thfi
first signs of violence. She saw her
child kneeling upon the floor with the
maniac school teacher holding the re
volver close to her head. The mother
fainted instantly. Then the crazy
young woman ordered a carriage. It
was so apparent that she was ready
to shoot the child at any moment that
her demand was obeyed.
Fourteen men mounted their horses
and rode beside the buggy, but did not
dare attempt to rescue the child. One
went on ahead to her announced des
tination, and when the strange cortege
arrived at this house Miss Roberts was
willing to be disarmed. She has been
brought here for treatment.

gold coin, in fives, tens and twenties.
The robbers evidently did | not care to
take a ' chance * in carrying the " silver
about : with ; them, as it weighed about
sixty.' pounds, as against i about thirty
pounds weight for the gold. * The place
where the stolen rig was found is only
three blocks from: the Santa Fe station â 
at Berkeley. The -authorities believe

with that of. the robbery of the Judsun

whether a train was approaching. He
then drove across the tracks and had

cut. jogging "along vest toward Point
Richmond. ,. At this juncture a tall,
slender, masked man stepped out from
behind a telegraph pole and pointed a
rifle at Daly's head.

SIXTY KILLED BY EXPLOSION
IN MASSACHUSETTS FACTORY
Fire Adds to Horror in Large Shoe Plant
Scores Fatally Injured Live to Per
form Deeds of Heroism.
BROCKTON, Mass., March 20.â At
least sixty persons were killed early
to-day by the explosion of a boiler in
a large shoe manufacturing establish
ment in the Campello district, con
ducted by the R. B. Grover Company.
The list of dead may reach as high as
eighty.
The explosion was immediately fol
lowed by a flash of flame, which con
sumed the factory, a long, tour-story
structuix, as if It were a house of
cards, and incinerated an unknown
number of men and women who were
unable to extricate themselves from a
mass of tangled wreckage formed by
the terrific upheaval in the boiler
room. More than fifty of the employes
in the building srere maimed, burned
or bruised by the time they reached
safe gTound. Some jumped from the
roof, some from windows and others
were injured in the mad rush to es
cape from the doomed factory, which
from all parts emitted the heat of an
inferno, driving back the band of
heroic rescuers who in a few moments
performed gallant service.
The nre extended from the factory
to seven other buildings in the vicinity
and destroyed them. One of these
buildings was a three-story wooden
one owned by t'harlep F. Dahlberg,
the others being cottages of small
value and a blacksmith shop. The
wooden dwellings near the engine room
were practically demolished by the fly
ing boiler, but none of the occupants
was seriously injured. The total finan
cial loss is estimated at J250.000, $200,000
of which falls on the R. B. Grover
Company. '
FRAGMENTS OF BODIES. -
It may never be known just how
many persons perished in the wreck
age. No one knows exactly how many
persons were in the factory. The num
ber has been estimated at 400. but
Treasurer Charles O. Emerson said 1 >-
night that he doubted whether there
were so many at work. Two hundred
and fifty-three survivors have been ac
counted for and at midnight the re
mains of fifty-three bodies had been
recovered from the ruins, the search
being continued all night. Fragments
of human frame? which may belong
to-ijodies other than those enumerated
have also been found. Few of the re
mains have been identified. The head in
nearly every instance is missing, and,
; t in rare instances, it was impos
sible to even distinguish the ccx.
Chief of Police Boy den at a late hour

some of the employes had not reached
the factory at the time of the explo

FLIGHT OF THE BOILER. V .
The explosion occurred shortly after
the operatives ; had - - settled down to
work for the day. Suddenly and with
out warning the air vibrated with the
roar of an explosion. At the same mo
ment the large wooden frame of the
factory quivered and then the rear por
tion- of it collapsed. This section of the
great building had been transformed
into a mass of iron and wood wreck
age, in the midst of which human be
ings were pinioned. In another mo
ment flames had broken out , in the
debris, and death by fire and suffoca
tion, became the fate of scores of the
operatives. â¢ i ; ?;V ; V
When the boiler exploded it' passed
upward almost perpendicularly, tear
ing a passage as it went, killing many
on the way. After rising high in the
air. it descended half the distance,' and,
then, swerving northerly, cut its. way
like some huge projectile through a
dwelling house fifty feet away and
pierced another dwelling farther along.
Scenes of horror followed the.wrench
ing apart of the factory building. - In
the rear the three upper floors, weight
ed as they were with heavy machinery,
collapsed with a crash that was. heard
for blocks. Men and women working
in departments of this section who were
busy at their machines had time but to
turn in an attempt to flee after the
first dull roar, when the flooring sank
beneath them and they were carried to
the ground, crushed a.nd bruised, amid
the mass of debris. Many fell into a
veritable fiery furnace. In the sections
of the factory which remained stand
ing the operatives were panic stricken
as they sought escape.
MAW ROASTED TO DEATH.
Many fled down the stairways and
reached the ground. Others ran to the
windows, the fire escapes in many
cases being torn away by the explosion.
In desperation many jumped from the
second and third floor windows to the
ground and were dangerously injured.
The crush on the stairways resulted in
numerous minor injuries.
Scarcely had the rear structure col
lapsed when a tongue of flame started
up from the boiler pit and reached out
as it ascended, communicated with the
s] (inter* of the wreckage and immedi
ately afterward with the standing
walls. Soon the entire story was in
flairifs.
Instant death was the fate of many
who went down with the floors that
1 collapsed. A large number of men and
women who were working near the
] supports were alive after the floors and
walls fell. From these unfortunates
criet of agony and terror went up.
Almost all had been caught between
! broken timbers, lighter wooden wreck
tnd heavy pieces of machinery. A
j few persons succeeded in extricating
â  themselves from the wreckage, but
! more were roasted to death.
DOpMBD, BIT SAVES OTHERS.
By this time nearby citizens had ar
rived to assist the employes who es
> raped begin the rescue of their fellows.
I This task became momentarily more
difficult and perilous, for the heat from,
the fire was almost unbearable. By
the use of lorfg pieces of timber the
; rescuers were able to raise parts of
th< wreckage and thereby release some
of the imprisoned men and women and
then by rushing into the smoke pull
them from the ruins.
Then it was that acts of sacrifice and
heroism were seen. One man whose
legs were caught under an iron beam
cried to the rescuers that they could
not extricate him,and to help the girls
behind him. Stretching out his arms,
he lifter! several girls, one by one, and
passed them to the rescuers. Then the
fire reached him and he died.
A woman who was entangled in a
shoe machine cried out that she was
<Iyinp and commanded the rescuers to
attend the others who might live. She
begged to be nh.it. Soon the flames
enveloped her.
PRIEST RENDERS AID.
Among the first to arrive on the
scene was Rev. James O'Rourke, curate
at St. Margaret's Roman Catholic
Church, near the fire. At the risk of
his life he removed seven persons from
the ruins before the flre had reached
them and was returning for the eighth
when he fainted. Father O'Rourke ad
ministered the last rites of the church
to many who lay dying.
Imprisoned operatives, too far away
for rescue, and who knew that their
lives<-would last hut a few moments,
spoke words of encouragement to rnose
! who seemed nearer escape. Some
prayed aloud; others pleaded with the
rescuers to say "good-by" to relatives.
The spectacle unnerved many who
i were trying vainly to get to the vic
tims and some turned away sick and
feinting. Members of the fire depart
ment with ladders aided greatly in the
work of rescue, but their time for
work was short, for within a brief in
tt-rval fire closed over the wreckage
and the cries of the imprisoned were
hushed.
THE BOILER OVERTAXED.
In an interview Mrs. David W.
Rockwell, wife of the engineer at the
factory, said:
"My husband had said many times
of late that he had to put on the
boiler a pressure it was unequal to. He ,
had to do this, he said, because the
work in the factory required it."

LEAVE HOMES

Trail Over Mojave Desert
Dotted With Prospectors
Lured On by Love of Biches
TRAVELERS SUFFERING
Dead Horses Along Route
Show Danger and Hard
ships of the Long Journey
HAWAII MEADOWS, via Keeler,
March 14.â Here in the Mojave Desert
the rush of prospectors and speculators
from the southern part of the State to
Goldfield can be observed. As far as
the eye can reach the trail is dotted
with good-seekers. All sorts and condi
tions of men, with outfits loaded into
every conceivable kind of vehicle, may
be seen daily hitting the trail for -the
gold fields- People who live along the
road between Mojave and Keeler, who
have heretofore made a scanty living
by catering to travelers, are suddenly
becoming rich. Bread may be had at
50 cents a loaf, and meals, when pur
chasable at all, cost from 75 cents to $1.
Hay sells for $30 a ton and stock may
be watered for 10 cents a- head. *
Recently severe storms have caused
great distress among those who are
crossing the desert. In many places
the roads are impassable even .to a
light spring wagon. In the past week
it has become a common sight to see a
heavily loaded wagon (and most of. the
wagons are overloaded) mired down to .
the hubs and the luckless prospectors
huddled about, wet, cold and disheart
ened. All along the road numberless
dead horses give testimony to the scar
city of feed and the severity of the
trip.
Among the many who have met with
hard luck are two experienced horse
traders who left Arizona bound for
Goldfield with two carloads of burros.
By the time the animals were at "The
Eighteen-Mile House," the first station
out of Mojave, they had cost the specu
lators $18 a head â a high price
for such animals in any country at any
time of the year. At Red Rack fully
25 per cent of the band, frenzied by
hunger, became unmanageable and
stampeded. The final blow fell at Coy
ote Hole, fifty miles out from Mojave,
where nearly the entire band was lost
in last Sunday's cloudburst. Another
prospector, mising the road, floundered
into a lake ten feet in depth and would
have lost his life except for the timely
assistance of R. A. Farmer, who is
connected with the United States Geo
logical Survey- ,
Most of the prospectors, however,
those with sufficient money and provi
sions for the trip, have suffered little
more than temporary inconvenience
and physical discomfort. But in every
gold rush there are many who. led on
by the glittering lure, start without
the money or the food necessary to see
thorn well launched into the trip.
Among this class the suffering is piiia
blt-. irdeed. On the desert food is pre
cious and t those who have food are be
coming hard-hearted to those who are
without it.

said to he involved.
It ia said that Berry went away in
February, and when he did not return
or explain his absence, an investiga
tion of his accounts was begun. It is
alleged that the expert accountants
who examined the books could not
straighten them and representatives of
estates involved applied to the courts
for relief.
Berry is about 50 years of age, and ,
his home is in Dorchester. When last
heard from he was in Chicago.
ment. Superintendent Emerson of the
Grover Company said that the amount
of pressure on the boiler was a mat
ter in which the factory officials did
not interfere.
"Rockwell," said he, "took his orders
in this matter from the Hartford Boiler
Insurance Company and if he over
worked the boiler he did it without
our knowledge."
BOSTON, March 20.â "A crack in the
lap seam of the boiler was responsible
for the accident," said an expert engi
neer of the Hartford Steam Inspection
and Insurance Company to-night. "It
was practically impossible to detect the
crack, as it was on the Inside part of
the lap running beside the rivets."
The boiler, being insured and in
spected by the Hartford Steam Boiler
Insurance Company, was exempt from
inspection by the district police under
the laws.

Sad Leave Taking
of General Ku

GUNSHU PASS, March 20. morning.
I The last two days have been utterly
without incident, except for the re
moval,of the censor to Kudzihu Pass.
The Russian rear guard is retreating
slowly and engaging in occasional
skirmishes. It has now reached a po
sition twenty-seven miles north of Tie
Pass. The Japanese are slowly ad
vancing, without pressing the Rus
sians. In the~course of the retreat the
Russians are destroying bridges, the
railway roadbed and highways and 1
carrying off stores and demolishing
buildings and everything not portable.
Reports of a wide turning movement
by the Japanese are no lqnger being '
received. There is increasing difficulty
in securing reliable information beyond
the limits within- which si-outing par
ties are active^ on account of the de- j
fection of many Chinese to the Jap- j
anese side. Many natives- who have |
been employed as servants by Russian |
officers have run away and other con- i
sequences oE the evacuation of Mukden :
are noticeable . in the, attitude of ths
Chinese.
The troops parted in sadness with
General Kuropatkin, whose labors in
shaping the army are recognized and
who was ever attentive to the wants !
of the soldiers in the matter of food. ,
clothing and shelter. Regardless of the
fact that he had been commander-in
chief, General Kuropatkin offered to
remain here as a subordinate of Gen
eral Linevitch and as commander of a
corps.
General Linevitch, who also enjoys
the respect and confidence of the troops
as a fighter, is determined to initiate !
reform by weeding out the overloaded
staff and other administrative depart
ments,, and is taking other steps which â 
it is believed will result in economy
U well as increasing the efficiency of I
the army. .

Bank headed the syndicate that took
the Chinese loan.
NEW YORK, March 20. â The par

however, are neglecting no precautions

HENRY LUNSTEDT
DIES SUDDENLY
Henry Lunstedt, former grand sec
retary of the Native Sons and brother
of SuDervisor Theodore Lunstedt, died
early this morning at the Lane Hos
pital. Lunstedt was taken to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital yesterday in
an almost dying condition. Dr. Glover
pronounced his case hopeless and he

has been ill for several months and was
rapidly growing to be a shadow of his
former ?*\t. He rallied a little last
night, but at midnight he suffered a

Spinal meningitis was the cause of his
death.
Henry Lunstedt was probably as
widely known as any other man in Cal

the position of grand secretary of the
Native Sons of the Golden West, and
during that long period he figured

GOVERNMENT BEGINS
BEEF TRUST INQUIRY
Eight Witnesses Summoned to Appear
Before Investigating Body To-Day,
CHICAGO, March 20.â The Govern
ment investigation of the "beef trust"
was begun to-day. Judge J. Otis
Humphrey of Springfield administered
the oath to the veniremen, whose
names have been kept a profound
secret for three weeks by the officials
of the United States District Attor
ney's office. The Government Is rep
resented by Assistant District Attor
ney C. B. Morrison and Assistant At
torney General Oliver H. Pagin. Much
information bearing on specific in
stances of alleged violation oÂ£ the
Sherman anti-trust law is said to be
in the hands of the Federal prosecutor.
The independent packers, headed by
Schwarzschild & Sulzberger, have ar
ranged to submit evidence to the Gov
ernment tending to show the manner in
which the smaller packer has been
forced to follow the dictation of the
so-called "big five."
Witnesses from Kansas City have
assigned dates for their appearance at
the Grand Jury session. Several re
ported to the District Attorney's office
to-day. Of the 300 subpenas issued.
Clerk McMillan of the District Court
reported that all except four had been
properly served. Attorney John S.
Mille, appearing in the case for all the
packers, denies that any witnesses for
the Government have been spirited
away, and are on "vacations," as has
been reported.
Because of the failure to secure six
teen men who are, in the opinion of
Judge Humphrey, sufficiently removed
in business affairs from the packing
industry, the swearing in of the jury
was delayed until to-morrow. Only
fifteen out of the twenty-three sum
moned were accepted for jury service.
Sixteen being required to constitute a
quorum, additional summonses were is
sued. Eight witnesses have been sub
penaed to appear before the investi
gators to-morrow.
It was learned to-day that United
States District Attorney General H. L.
Burnett has been taking evidence here
for a week past in connection with the
investigation. The list of witnesses
has not been made public, but is re
ported to include the names of all the
New York representatives of the big
packing concerns.

Friends of the Secretary

to His Physical Condition
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 20. â In dip
lomatic circles the belief is becoming
fixed that Secretary of State Hay, now
on the Atlantic Ocean seeking health
and strength, will never return to his
official position. Many are so pessi
mistic as to believe he may never re
turn alive, while practically all be
lieve he will not again take un the
duties of his office.
It has been known for a long time
that his immediate family has op
posed his continuation in office, but
has been unable to nersuade him to
let go long enough to take a rest un
til now. Only expressions of deep re
gret are heard on all sides at his col
lapse on Saturday.
Secretary Taft is mentioned as Hay's
probable successor should Hay deter
mine to relinquish his work.
TROOPERS VIEW
GEYSER'S BIRTH
Newcomer in Yellowstone
Park Spouts Water to
a / Height of 200 Feet
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
BUTTE, Mont., March 20.â Reports :
received here state that a new geyser
has burst forth in Norris Basin, in
the Yellowstone National Park. It was
named the Skyrocket, because of the :
peculiar noise it makes when it spouts, i
and its coming, it is believed, has
proved the death of Constant geyser, j
located in the same basin.
The Skyrocket plays at regular inter
vals three times a week and spouts
boiling water to an immense height, j
An odd fact In connection with its
coming is that it was born on Wash- :
lngton's birthday, playing the first time
it spouted to a height of 200 feet. The !
noise accompanying the discharge was
terrific and attracted the attention of
the troopers In the park. An entire j
cavalry troop witnessed its birth.
The geyser Is one of the most beau
tiful in Yellowstone Park. It is located
about thirty miles from Old Faithful
geyser.
This is the second geyser born recent- ;
ly in the Yellowstone Park. A splen
did geyser was born last fall and
played intermittently for a period, but
is now practically quiescent. Its pe
riods of activity apparently come once
in ten years.

Duck returned from a trip out of town.
Unknown highbinders attempted to
murder a Chinese Friday night and to
day mysterious placards appeared on
the walls of Chinatown warning Tom
Lee and Gin Gum that they will be
murdered. Lee and Gum, with counsel
for their society, complained to Dis
trict Attorney Jerome that Mock Duck
instigated the attempt to kill thÂ©. Chi
nese and posted the warning placards.
It has been reported in Chinatown
for several days that Mock Duck had
recently returned from San Francisco,
and that with him came four members
of a Chinese society whose members
accepted only commissions to kill.
Duck has twice been tried on a
charge of murder and is at liberty on
his own recognizance under that
charge at present. He said to-day that
he had never been in California in his
life It is alleged he came from San
Francisco.
Duck was committed to the Tombs
prison to await a third trial on an old
indictment accusing him of killing Ah
Lee in this city in 1900.

ROBBERS GAG AND BIND MEN
Steal Money That Was for Workmen
at Point Richmond Oil Works.
Continued from Page 1, Column 7.
knives, which they threw in the grass.
After again warning the two mep
not to move under penalty of having
their heads blown oft, the masked rob
bers hurriedly returned to where the
vehicle was. In a few minutes Daly
and Roche heard the sounds of the
buggy as it was driven away.
Koche was the first to free himself.
He worked the gag out of his mouth
and managed to wriggle his hands free,
although they were fastened behind his
back, but before they were released
he worked oft the mask on his face by
catching an end of it in his teeth.
ROCHE FREES HIMSELF.
As soon as he was free Roche hast
ened to Daly's assistance and quickly
loosened his thongs. The bandages on.',
they looked about. The buggy was not
in sight. The robbers had disappeared
as if swallowed up in the earth. After
a few minutes of investigation the vic
tims decided to notify the police. Daly
and his companion ran at top speed
to the Southern Pacific station at
Stege, where they told Station Agent
P. K. Grady what had occurred. The
police at Oakland were informed, the
Lank was notified, and through the of
ficials there word was sent to Point
Richmond, to Martinez and to Sheriff
Barnet in Oakland.
In a short time Barnet, with Deputy
Marshal Carey of Berkeley, Deputy
Sheriffs William Moffat and George
Wales, Detectives D. Holland and A.
Shorey of Oakland, Sheriff Veale of
Contra Costa County, with his depu
ties, Boquet. Johnson, C. E. Smith and
D. S. Tyer were on the ground and the
man-hunt began.
Daly and Roche with deputies went
on to Point Richmond and thence took
up the trail to San Pablo,, working
back toward Oakland, but without suc
cess. The robbery was coolly exe
cuted and the pair of bold highway
men not only made their clean up, but
so far as the authorities know eluded
capture by doubling back on their pur
suers. They had a full hour's start
and could readily have driven from the
"cut" to where the buggy was found
in half an hour.
STUDIED OUT PLAN.
Daly's horse was a spirited animal I
and when recovered showed evidence
of fast driving, being covered with '
foam that had dried after his long
Etand. That the robbers were familiar ;
with the locality seems evident from '
the location of the stolen buggy. By ;
driving back on Potrero avenue, turn- ;
ing south on San Pablo avenue, a rapid j
drive would soon land them at Hopkins ;
street. West Berkeley, and that thor- ;
oughfare runs into Sacramento street. â 
Addison street is a block north of Uni- j
versity avenue, main thoroughfare j
connecting East and West Berkeley.
Sacramento street is midway between '
the two sections of the city. With the j
Santa Fe near at hand, with electric ;
cars connecting with the Southern Pa- i
ciflc broad-gauge station at the foot
of University avenue, with equally con- i
venient facilities for getting into East |
Berkeley, the opportunities for escape '
were so numerous that the robbers j
could easily have planned their escape. !
For two years Daly had been em- |
ployed by the Central Bank to take i
the monthly consignments of coin to ;
the Bank of Richmond. The banks j
had an arrangement by which the Cen- j
tral Bank honored drafts to save the :
Richmond people from carrying the ;
coin that was used at the oil works to !
meet the payroll. Daly most of the j
time went himself. Occasionally his â 
partner would make the trip. To-day j
Daly invited Roche, an acquaintance,
to take the ride with him for company's
sake. Roche had gone with Daly last i
month. After it was all over to-night j
Daly came to the conclusion that some |
one who had become acquainted with j
the way the coin was handled had i
plotted the robbery.
Daly decided that he had been i
watched for a long time for a favor
able opportunity. In support of this the
ory he recalled having noticed a buggy
standing on Railroad avenue, a par
allel road to the railroad tracks that
runs north from the "cut" on the east
tide of the railroad embankment. ThÂ«*
stabiemaji observed the buggy there
this morning as he drove along, but
:>aid no special attention to it. The
i :â¢., \v;.s gone after the robbery oc
curred.
Roche and Daly saved the gases and
ropes and turned them over to the au
thorities. The gags were knotted
pitces of canton fiannel and blue shirt
ing fastened by ordinary spring twine.
The masks of cotton napkins werw
also tied on by twine. New bale rope
was used for the thongs about the
men's hands and feet. Tho iobbevs
worked quickly and they did not make
as goud a job of their fastenings as
they might have with less speed.
They had their situation well in
hand, for, while* they were working
over their victims, a train passed along
through the cut, within fifty feet of the
scene, but the men were hidden behind
the grass on the embankment.
The robbers took care to see that
neither Daly nor Roche were armedâ
in fact, neither of them had a firearm
or weapon more deadly than their
pocket-knives. Daly said he had never
been afraid of trouble, as he did not
suspect his errand was known to out
siders. He is sure now that the rob
bers were well informed as to his mis
sion in view of the remark one of them
made about the "oil money."
EXPLAINS HIS TRIP.
Roche. Daly'3 companion is a son of
A. W. Roche of Pasadena, the youns?
man's home until two years ago, when
he came to Oakland. Until two months
ago Roche had been in the Sunset Tele
phone Company's employ in this city.
He resides at 1427 Franklin street.
In explaining his trip, Roche said
Daly had invited him to go along as
he had last month. And he added:
â It was the nerviest thing I ever
witnessed. When the man with the
Winchester rifle jumped out at Daly I
did not realize what had occurred until
the second man stuck his pistol toward
me. The man who talked with me had
a foreign accent, German or Swedish.
They got us out of the buggy mighty
quick and soon had us smothered in
gags and blinders. Both men wore
white cloth masks that covered their
faces from their eyes down. I could
only get a general impression of them.
They ordered us about in a lively way.
"After we had been secured and were
lying on our faces I heard the buggy
driving away. It wasn't but a feu
mlnutes before I got myself loose. I
cautiously looked over the edge of the
embankment, but saw no one. Then I
tore Daly loose and we started on the
run for the railroad depot."
Daly supplemented Roche's story
with details of the encounter with the
masked robbers. The stableman was
surprised by the sudden approach el
the first highwayman. Daly continued:
DALY TELLS STORY.
"The man who approached me was
hiding behind a telegraph pole on the
right hand side of the road, near
which was a broken-down farmer's
wagon. When he ordered me to stop,
the rifle being at my head, I Jerked,
out my whip to start the horse going,
but the robber said: 'Don't you make
another move or I'll blow your head
off.' I stopped just as the other robber
came up on Roche. They made me
drive off the road to a fence, where we
both got out at their command. My
robber said:
""I suppose you know what we
want?'
" 'Yes,' I replied. 'I guess I do.'
"Then I asked them to tie the horse
fast so that he would not run away.
After that was done they marched us
across the road, through the fence
along the railroad embankment south
as far as a telegraph pole. After we
had been tied and gagged we were
warned not to raise our heads, under
pain of having them blown off. After
Roche released me we examined thÂ«
tracks where mr buggy had been
turned around and driven back toward
the San Pablo road. The buggy 1 bad
seen across the track had aisi> disap
peared. :
"lam satisfied that the robbery was
the result of long planning -by persons
who .had knowledge of mv v trips to
Richmond with the coin. Probably this
time was the first chance the highway
men had when there was no one In
sight. The place they selected was an
ideal spot. There ire no houses near
by and the embankment entirely hides
the view from th.? east. To the west
the road stretches in a straight shoot
for a couple cf miles, and only fields
and marshes line i: on either side. ThÂ«
tlir.e from wh#fS we were stopped to the
freeing of our bindings was not mora
than five or six minute*. .
WANTED COMPANION*.
"I rook Roche with me more for com
pany than anything else. I told him
last ni=ht I intended to so thin morn
ing. He accepted the invitation pro
viding it did nÂ«Â»t rain to-day. He was
formerly a bookkeeper for the tele
phone company, but had been doing a.
little clerical work for me at the stable
of late. . -
"It iÂ» lucky that to-day's consign
ment of coin v.aa the smallest I hayÂ«
ever carried. Usually there was not
less than â¦!.",. 0"Â«> or $16,000 and some
times !t ran era higher. '
Oaly *r.d Roche returned to Oakland
this evening, v. here they had a lonif
conference with Sheriff Veale. wtM
came down from Martin ?z. They de
scribed the rubbers as follows:
No. 1. Tall, slender about "5 year*
oH, wearing a blue suit. No. !. Stout,
full abdomen. 170 pounds weight, array
suit.
W. G. Palmanteer. vice president of
the Central Bank, said:
"The first news of the crime reached
me through Daly. I at once notified thÂ«
authorities. I have no theories nor any
information other than that which has
come to me through the open channels.
Mr. Roche is known to our bank
through letters his father brought to
us , two years ago from Henry Newby
of the Pasr.dena National Bank."
Thronph the American Bankers As
sociation tho Pinkerton detective forc#
has been put ;u work on the robbery.
At Point J:!fhmnnd and at Stege thÂ«
opinion is prevalent that the robbery
was committee! by men who had cloa*
observation uf the methods nf handling
the payroll money. The < 'ontra Cost*
foothills and th>? country fr -m Oakland
to Martinez wr-re scoured by posses
arm^fl with rillos ami shotguns. ThÂ«
late recovery Â«f Daly's buggy rather
set back the pursuers. It was feared
that the highwaymen had made good
in th^ir plan to get away.
Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County
to-nierht had a lona: Interview with
Roche and with Daly, comparing notes
as to their statements of the robbers-
The local authorities have been in con
ference on the case, with the result that
the closest inquiry is being made into
all of its phase.-*.

THAT ARE BAD
Management of St. Francis
Asks Police to Apprehend
Horseman Arthur Peabody
HEAVY LOSER AT RACES
Missino- Man Is Supposed
to Be Near Albuquerque,
ou His Way to Chicago
The St. Francis Hotel management '
is making q strenuous effort to over
take Arthur Peabody. a well-known
racing man, who, until Sunday morn
ing, was a guest at the hostelry and
is now supposed to be somewhere be- I
tween this city and Albuquerque. The j
missing man is charged with having
pawed several bad checks at the ho
tel just prior to his departure. The !
suspicions of the management being j
amused, a telegram waJs sent to the
Equitable Trust Company of New |
York, on which the checks had been
drawn, and last evening the response
came that the checks were bad.
Immediately upon receipt of this
information Manager Woods dis
patched an attache of the hotel with |
the telegram to police headquarters,
where a conference with Castain of
Detectives Burnett resulted in a tele
gram bping sent to the Chief of Police
of Albuquerque asking him to arrest
Peabody on the Arrival of the Santa
Fe train there late last night. It is
understood that the hotH people will
have Peabody brought back to this
<ity and prosecuted.
Peabody has been a guest at the St.
Francis for a number of months. He
followed the races as a means of live
lihood, but of late, it is said, he had
not been plavlng the horses very suc
cessfully. For a time he owned Sol
Lichtenstein, who persisted in running
contrary to the expeettttions of his
master, and finally, several days ngo,
Peabody sold the horse back to his
former owners. It was about this
time that his acquaintances at the St.
Francis began to notice that he was
worrying- about something. They at
tributed his change in disposition to
his track misfortunes.
Recently Peabody s^nt his wife and
child East. Saturday night he paid
his bill at the hotel, and Sunday de
parted, presumably for Chicago, on
the Santa Fe train. At the hotel last
evening the management was reticent
regarding its experience with Pea
body. Manager Woods declined to
discuss the matter. Assistant Manager
Wills professed to have no knowledge
of the affair, and House Detective
Herstiey, who represented Manager
Woods at the police headquarters ear
lier in the evening, denied even that
he had called on Captain Burnett or
had learned that Peabody had depart
ed from the hotel.

BAKERSFIELD, March 20.â As a re
sult of a murderous attack upon United
States Recruiting: Officer J. M. Clark
last night Fred Bevln Is now In the
County Jail, with a bullet hole in his
left breast. The shot which caused
the vound was fired by the recruiting

Sunday night Bevin called on Clarke.
He was then sober and asked to see
his children, who were taken from him
at the time that his wife, now Mrs.
Clarke, secured a divorce from him in
September, 1903. He made a second
call abuut an hour later. He was some
what under the Influence of liquor, and
after asking for a drink suddenly at
tacked Clarke. The latter saw Bevin
draw a revolver, and he grrappled with
him. He succeeded in wresting the
weapon from the frenzied man's grasp
and threw it on the floor. Bevin se
cured a hold on the officer's throat and
was strangling him when Clarke drew
his own weapon and, pressing it
against his assailant's breast, fired.
Bevin fell to the floor.
An officer was hastily summoned. It
was found, upon reaching the Jail,
that the wound was not serious. The
ball struck a rib, glanced off and
passed through the fleshy part of the
arm.

OIL DELUGES
A GRAVEYARD
Standard Company Strikes
a Gusher on the Edge
of a Cemetery in Kansas
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PAOLA, Kans., March 20. â Oil from
a well drilled for the Standard Oil
Company, which was "shot" to-day,
ruined several thousand dollars' worth
of monuments in Oak Grove cemetery.
The well was drilled almost on the
boundary line of the cemetery, and the
wind sprayed the entire western part
of the graveyard with oil. The tomb
stones and monuments bear the ap
pearance of having been flreswept.
Moreover, not a spear of vegetation
will grow on the graund where the oil
has fallen and the trees have all been
killed.
There is much indignation and sev
eral damage suits are certain to fol
low unless the company pays for the
damage. Other wells are being drilled
almost on the connecting line, and un
less care is taken more damage will
be done.
There is talk of an effort to have
an ordinance passed to prevent drilling
within the city limits.

reached here at 8 o'clock to-night
that two spans of the Phoenix and
Eastern Railroad steel bridge over
Salt River at Tempe toppled over
thirteen minutes after the last train
for Phoenix had crossed. There was
no one on the bridge at the time. The
estimated loss is approximately $50,
000.
To-day has been the first real clear
day ln weeks, and there have been no
signs of rain since early this morning.
Salt River, from rains above, is at
this point higher than at any time
before this year and is playing havoc
with the low farm lands. Another
small Cave Creek flood invaded Phoe
nix this afternoon. Another hundred
feet of the Maricopa and Phoenix
Railroad bridge over the Gila went
out last night, making a total breach
in the structure of 860 feet. The river
is still too high to do much toward
repairing the bridge.

KAHN ARGUES
FOR WITTMAN
He Eefers to Accusations
Made Against Two of the
Board in His Argument
JUDGMENT IS POSTPONED
Chiefs Trial Is Finished,
but Commissioners Defer
Decision Until Friday
Chief Wittman's fate is now In the
hands of the Police Commissioners,
who will pass <>n th? charges made
against him next Friday night. After
an eloquent address to the board last
night. Julius Kahn. the Chiefs attor
ney, said: "In the face of this evi
dence it is your duty to declax* these
charges not well founded and to dis
miss them.'
Congressman Kahn minced no word*
in his closing argument. He respected
no personalities. After an introduction
in which he branded the testimony
against the Chief as hearsay he sud
denly said: "Take your own case,
Mr. Commissioner Reagan. It has been
said that you have been using your po
sition as Police Commissioner to force
saloonmen to take out insurance poli
cies. What did you say to that? You
said, 'Bring me a man who will say
this." Is that the sort of evidence upon
which you would desire to be convict
ed?"
Some evidence of excitement was
seen when this line of argument was
taken, but Kahn continued in the same
strain, saying:
TakÂ« thÂ« caÂ«Â« of my friend. Mr. Drink
house. It has been said that h* tried v â '-
â¢rat saloonmen into buying his clgara Wouli
he want to bÂ« tried by this hearsay evidence"
Ho would demand. "Bring me thÂ« man." That
is tha teÂ«t.
Here Commissioner Reagan re
marked, "Poheim will be jealous. He
i 3 being left out of this."
"Mr. Poheim has not been long
enough in the position. His time may
come." retorted the Congressman. I
dare say they may say the same sort
of thing about me.
"The. genus knocker is more prev
alent in San Francisco than anywhere
else on the globe. You should try this
case in the same spirit in which you
would want to be tried for any offense
charged against you."
Before Kahn began his address Com
missioner Reagan called Policeman
Handley to the stand and asked him
two questions:
"Do you know Chan Cheung?"
"I do," replied the policeman.
"Did you ever see him at the resi
dence of Chief W T ittman?"
"I did not. Never," replied Handley
firmly.
At the conclusion of Kahn's argu
ment the Commissioners held a whis
pered conversation. Reagan moved
that the case go over until Friday and
the others assented.
The application of Henry Doscher for
a transfer of his saloon license from
the Hotel Ruy to the Ocean boulevard
was granted with restrictions. A num
ber of residents of the Great Highway
who opposed the transfer were pres
ent. A letter from John T. Kelly, the
attorney, was read. It bitterly op
posed the transfer. Residents of the
district and members of the Outdoor
Art League wanted to protest, but the
Commissioners had already reached a
decision granting the application with
ironclad restrictions.
The place must be orderly, contain
no booths, rooms or sleeping apart
ments. There must be no dancing or
boisterous conduct on the premises and
no music after 10 o'clock.
The trial of Sergeant Shaw, charged
with making an illegal arrest and as
sault by T. L. Moran was resumed.
Moran alleges that on February 22
Sergeant Shaw kicked him without
provocation, and after placing him un
der arrest did not appear against him
in court. In rebuttal the sergeant de
clares that Moran was abusive and
under the influence of liquor.
To prove that Moran was under the
influence it was shown that when he
first entered the saloon of T. J.
O'Boyle at Ellis and Mason streets,
where the trouble occurred, he first
drank a "seltzer sour." This was of
fered by Congressman Julius Kahn,
who acted as Shaw's attorney, that
Moran was intoxicated.
Policeman Fennel, who witnessed the
affair, declared positively that Sergeant
Shaw did not kick or ill-use Moran in
any way. "He simply ordered him un
der arrest because he was drunk and
impudent," declared Fennel. The case
will be resumed next Friday evening.
ADMITS FINDING POISON.
Burnett Has Bottle of Strychnine
Tablets Discovered at Mansion.
Captain Burnett admitted last even
ing that a bottle of poison was found
by the detectives in the Stanford man
sion, as wai published exclusively in
The Call. Vigorous attempts have been
made to discredit the report of the dis
covery of the bottle, but again this
paper's superior service in gathering
the facts in the great mystery is at
tested by an official confirmation.
The bottle in question was found by
Detectives Cleary and Ed Gibson in
their search of the residence and wai
filled with strychnine tablets. Mrs.
Stanford frequently took potions of nux
vomica as a stimulant. Miss Berner,
on her return to-day, is expected to
throw further light on this point. This
bottle of tablets may play an important
part in the case, as do the cascara cap
sules in the mystery immediately sur
rounding the death of Mrs. Stanford at
Honolulu.
One bottle, marked "poison," was
found in Mrs. Stanford's medicine chest
that is believed to contain carbolic
acid. Captain Burnett professes thafc
this has not yet been analyzed. Almost
every bottle In the chest contained
some form of poison and the captain
names arsenic among others.

Lady Haldon Re-enters Profession
She Deserted for Title.
. LONDON, March
TO. â Lady Haldon

Ppecia! Dispatch to The Call
BERLIN, March 20.â Nobody in the
world, not even the most frenzied Jap
anese patriot, has taken more pride in
the successes of Japanese arms in Man
churia than Major General Meekel, a j
grizzled veteran of the German gen- J
eral staff, the organizer of the modern j
army of Japan. Following the vie- j
toriea of the'Yalu, Kinchau, Nanshan
and Llaoyang in the spring and sum
mer of last year, a cablegram from the
Japanese front reached General Meck
el's pretty suburban home outside Ber
lin, reading: "Japan's victories have
been won by your :>upiis."
Meckei protests modestly that he
had nothing to do with the military i
upbringing of Kuroki. Oku. Nogi and j
the other Japanese army commanders, j
but all the younger divisional and bri
gade leaders studied organization :ind j
tactics at his feet, and the brilliant
deeds they have done before Port Ar
thur and on the bloody plains of the |
Liaotung Peninsula were largely the I
result of lessons Meckel taught them.
TEACHES THE JAPANESE.
General Meckel was detailed by the
German headquarters' staff to go to
Toklo seventeen years ago. when Japan
sent to Germany for an expert to take
hold of its war academy and reorgan
ize Its military establishment. Until
that time the Mikado's army had been
modeled on French lines, but the isl
and empire reached the tardy conclu
sion that as German strategy had
proved itself so superior to French sol- |
diership in 1870 and 1371, it was high
time to abandon the old system. Meck
el, with a brilliant record of active
service in the Danish, Austrian and
French campaigns, was selected as the
ideal man to put the Japanese soldiers
into shape. From 1885 to 1888 he was
busy at Tckio undoing the lessons
taught by French officer?. He unfold
ed the doctrine* of Moltke and Rood
to thousands of young officersâ then
mostly mere subalterns of the lieuten
ant gradeâ but who are to-day lead
ing regiments, brigades, divisions and
army corps in Manchuria.
FAITH IN MIKADO'S MEN.
Of course, Meckel has unbounded
faith In the ultimate success of Japan
in the titanic struggle with Russia.
He was one of the few expert Euro
pean critics who never lost faith in
s*t.panese capacity because it took so
long to compel the fall of Port
Arthur.
'Xogi did marvels to take it as soon
as he has," was Meckel's first com
mfent when the news of the capitula
tion finally came. Meckel also occu
pied a conspicuously lonely position,
after the fall of the "Gibraltar of the
East," by declining to join in the
chorus of acclaim for Stoessel with â 
which the world was filled. Mockel I
said if the world had praise to shower. !
it belonged to the Japanese who had I
overcome insurmountable obstacles in I
taking the fortress â not to the Rus
sians who fought behind practically
invincible cover.
General Meckel is no longer actively
attached to the German head
quarters staff, but is merely "at dis
position" â that is, subject to service tn
case of need. He lives in splendid i
style in a palatial villa at Steglitz, one
of Berlin's handsomest suburbs. His
home is filled with costly works of
Oriental art, presented by the Mikado
and by highly placed military admir
ers in Japan. Two of his most cher- |
ished treasures are a pair of Japanese I
collies of exceedingly rare breed,
which were sent to him a year ago
as a special present from Field Mar
shal Oyama. Meckel hears frequently
from his former pupils in th* field,
with whom as instructor he was ex- j
traordinarily popular.

TANGIER, Morocco, March 20â The
announcement that Emperor William

ing great excitement among the na
tives. Even influential Mocrs express
the belief that Germany will help the
Sultan against the French and assert
that the German Emperor's visit will

BERLIN, March 20,-Discusslng the
supposition abroad that Germany has
designs on Morocco and is opposing the
plans of France, the semi-official North
German Gazette refers to- Emperor
William's utterances at Vigo. Spain.
In 1904, during his meeting with King
Alfonso, that Germany sought no terri
torial advantages in Morocco of any
sort, but only desired a continuance of
economic equality.
"It Is not presumed here," the paper
adds, "that the? Sultan intends to en
ter into any engagements that would
limit his choice or interfere with his
power in the future to treat equally
traders of all countries within his ter
ritories. Moreover, the situation in
Morocco draws Into consideration the
interests of the world's traffic."

sought out Evangelist McComb and,
ceiling him aside, related the story of -
his misdeed.
"^1 want to tell you that I am a,
murderer," said Bodine. "Eight years ;
ago I killed a man in Fort Fairfield. '
Me., and ever since, no matter where
1 go, 1 see his eyes watching me and ;
I cannot stand the strain any longer. :
Now if you think it's best I will give j
myself up to the police and let them :
punish me if they wish."

himself up, but took no steps to have
him arrested.

that he was an ex-convict and had
bc-en a tramp since he was 16 years old.

crime to the police:
My name is liar! Roy Bodine, and I was
born in London. Canada. I am 'Zi year* old
and ha\> been a tramp since 1 was s4xtee-n.
In June, J897, I wa* at Fort FairSeld. Me.,
and while thtre I uw-t a yegc-man, as hobo

know. I' J.i.-- man one â¢'â â '-:â  asked me to take
a walk with him and he >d me down to
the bank at the Arnostook River. There he
Â«-u<sdÂ»-r!ly attacked me and in the straggle
which followed I drew n revolver and shot
him through the hr-ad. killing him instantly.
Whf-n 1 realized what I had done I became
(riSfatneA; an 4 dragging the body down the
I^Jik I wsdÂ»><l out into the river, and when
;n "the current I released it and it float *4
â¢.way. The last thing I saw as the body
v.-f-nt down the stream were the man's *>â¢Â»Â«,
â which were wi^e open, and those eyes have
haunted me ever slnre.
1 have ofttn wanted to confess, but nÂ»ver
; hid the courage to do w until 1 hpard the
rTeachins <S the evangelists here in Aakiand.
After listening to Mr. McCrmb I made up
tny mind u> tell him what I had cone and
let him advise mÂ». He told me it would be
bftter for me t,j give myself up and *o I
esme here. 1 am glad that 1 have told the
nory of the 'murder ard do not far punish
ment, for I hnv accepted Chrirt as my
fsvinr end h* will, stand by me.

Justice One Woman Wants
Mercy, the Other Vengeance
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 20.
With the mothers of both the youths
who shot Policeman James Hume
Smith to death on the night of Novem
ber 27, 1903, as intent listeners to his
words, Deputy District Attorney Har
ris began the arguments to the jury
to-day which is now considering the
evidence against David Kiniry, who
with his Dal, Joe Goldstein, committed
the crime in the progress of which
Goldstein lost his life. Kiniry, as the
last of the three engaged in that strug
gle, is now within a day' of a verdict
that may send hfm to the gallows. '
It is with diverse interest that the
two women sit and listen to the scath
ing arraignment of the attorney now
making his appeal for an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth, asking for
a verdict at the hands of the twelve
men, good and true, that will condemn
Kiniry to pay with his life for the one
he took. Mrs. Kate Greiner, Gold
stein's mother, charges Kiniry with
being the cause of her son's downfall
and says that Kiniry was older and led
her boy astray. She now hopes to see
him convicted. Mrs. Watson, Kiniry's
mother, sits beside the defendant, and
with downcast face shows by her pres
ence that in her heart she hopes to see
him escape the extreme penalty, and
dreads with a mothers heart to see the
flesh of her flesh condemned to destruc
tion. *
The courtroom was crowded as it
has not been during any part of the
trial. People stood in the aisles and
chairs were brought in and placed
within the rail for the accommodation
of a number of women and specially
favored spectators of the male sex.
Harris consumed the greater part of
the day and an early adjournment was
taken. To-morrow A. L. Frick will
make an appeal for his client, and if* he
gets through by noon District Attor
ney Allen will make the closing argu
ment, so that the case can go to the
jury to-morrow evening.

Every Employe Under the'
Board Is Discharged at
End of the Present Month
"ECONOMY AND REFORM"
Only Those Who Are Abso
lutely Necessary Will Be
Reappointed to Old Places
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 20.
Consternation reigns at the Alame
da County Courthouse, and all of the
small army of employes who hold
their offices by virtue of the Board of
Supervisors are wondering what Is
coming next. Every county employe
who holds his appointment from the
Supervisors finds himself confronted
with a notice that at the end of the
present month his place will become
vacant, and it is a question whether
he will again be appointed.
The shock came to-day when Su
pervisor Talcott presented a resolution
before the Supervisors "That all per
sons employed by this board, and
whose services are paid for from the
county general or the county infirm
ary funds, are hereby notified that
from and after March 31, 1905, their
positions are hereby declared vacant."
The resolution was adopted without
objection.
This means that every employe at
the county infirmary, all of the em
ployes at the courthouse, including
the county expert and several special
clerks employed by the board for
copying, will cease their official con
nection with the county in two weeks.
Between now and April 1 the board
will decide who will be retained in the
county employ.
It is certain that all of those now
drawing salaries from the county
treasury will not be reappointed, and
there will be a decided reduction in
the county payroll. There has been
much talk about extravagance in
county management of late, and Su
pervisors have determined that they
will begin by scaling down the pay
roll. Economy and reform is to 'be
the cry at the county buildings, and
the Supervisors have begun by dis
charging everybody, with the privilege
of re-employing those whom they
wish to retain.
AUBURN WANTS
TOURIST HOTEL
Wealthy Citizens of Placer
County Devise Plans to
Boom the Golden State
AUBURN, March 20. â What may
prove one of the most important
steps In the development of Placer
County was to-day decided upon by a
committee of the Placer County Im
provement Association appointed to
look into the, matter of tourist hotels.
An Important site of from five to ten
acres, worth all the way from $7500
to J 16,000, will be donated as a
starter to the builder of a modern
tourist hotel in or near Auburn. In
addition surrounding property for an
extension of the grounds will be sold
at reduced figures.
The committee on hotels consists
of E. J. Kendal, W. S. Davis and
George D. Kellogg. Among others in
terested are Judge J. H. Wills, E. B.
Willis, editor of the Placer County
Republican, Captain W. J. McCann,
J. W. Francis, E. A. Birchall, H. H.
Richman, W. A. Shepard, Joseph
Clegg, Thomas James, L. L. Chamber
lain. J. M. Furweuder and many
others.
The opinion was expressed that the
building of a tourist hotel would do
much to attract a wealthy class of res
idents from the East. At a meeting
to-day Hamilton Wright of the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee deliv
ered an effective address on the neces
sity of a chain of tourist hotels for
the Sacramento Valley. The committee
appointed will probably send a repre
sentative to the East in the very near
future to confer with hotel men and
raise the necessary capital to inaug
urate the project. At least sixty men
in the county have expressed them
selves as desirous of supporting the
proposition, and it is believed that
many others who are able will be will
ing to do so when they are ap
proached.

TO CUT SHORT
MILITARY WORK
President Wheeler Makes
Important Announcement
Upon Return From East
WAR DEPART3IENT ACTS
Obnoxious Regulations to
Be Modified in Response
to Request of Colleges
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, March 20.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of
the University of California announced
to-day, upon his return from the East,
that the War Department at Wash
ington, in deference to united request!
from the land grant colleges of the
United States, is to make important
concessions to all the universities
where military training is required,
which will have the effect. It is hoped,
of lessening the disfavor In which the
military feature of college instruction
is held at nearly all these institutions.
It is promised by the War Depart
ment, says President Wheeler, that tbe
drilling period, which hitherto has last
ed for three years of a college man's
life, shall be reduced to two years, and
that instead of five hours of drill and
guard mounting each a week three
hours only will be required.
It appears that while the University
of California Joined with all the other
land-grant colleges, so-called, in beg
ging the War Department to moderate
the severity of its requirements, the
news of the California institution's co
operation with other institutions in
this matter has just become known,
President Wheeler having: decided to
make public the facts now, in view of
the approaching action of the Wax De
partment.
The riot in which the class in mili
tary instruction at the university par
ticipated last term, when Captain
Nance's famous marching order was
enforced, with its attending train of
conflicts between students and military
instructor, is supposed to hayÂ« influ
enced the California University to join
with other colleges in asking for an
abatement of military requirements,
though President Wheeler does not ad
mit that the Nance episode affected thÂ«
matter.
It is confessed by President "Wheeler
that the military part of the college
curriculum has always been rather
perfunctorily carried out. here as else
where it being almost impossible to ex
act from students all that the college
regulations call for in the way of mili
tary drill, and which the War Depart
ment expects when ij. details an army
officer to drill and teach the students in
military affairs.
President Wheeler paid particular
attention, while in the East, to the
relation which agricultural farms sus
tain to agricultural colleges, with a
view to ascertaining the best method
of locating such a farm with regard to
its proximity to the agricultural col
lege. As a result of his investigations,
he says that ft will be most unwise, in
the opinion of experts in this work, to
have the farm farther than a few miles
from the agricultural college. The
farm is not to be a model farm, if the
best models in the East, such as the
lowa and Illinois institutions, are fol
lowed, but rather a laboratory for the
students in the agricultural college.
President Wheeler has been absent
from the university for three week".
He witnessed the inauguration of Pres
ident Roosevelt, and visited the larger
cities, including New York, Boston.
Chicago. Raltlmore and Philadelphia.

th-e college during the absence of Pres
ident David Starr Jordan, has appoint
ed a committee consisting of represen
tatives of the alumni, students and fac
ulty of the university to meet the body
of Mrs. Stanford in San Francisco to
morrow. The faculty representatives
are the advisory board of Stanford
University, composed of the heads of
th'f departments. The alumni are San
Francisco graduates and the student
representation is taken from the four
undergraduate class
This escorting committee will wait
for the arrival of the Alameda to-mor
row and th<-n assume entire charge of
the body. The casket will not be taken
to the San Francisco residence, but
will be brought direct to the Palo Alto
home There the remains of Mrs.
Stanford will lie in state until Friday
morning, when they will be taken into
the great Memorial Church. Then will
follow the impressive funeral service,
the lons procession of mourning stu
dents, faculty and other friends to the
mausoleum, the final prayer there and
the interment in the now empty stone
sarcophagus.
There will, however, be a small fu
neral procession to-morrow from the
little station at Palo Alto to the Stan
ford mansion. This will be made up of
the relatives of Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford, the faculty of the university,
many of the alumni and some of the
students The committee appointed
by Vice President Branner to meet the
body in San Francisco will also lead
the way from Palo Alto to the Stan
ford estate.

Thousands May Attend Services at the
Mausoleum, However.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
20. â The problem of providing accom
modations In the Memorial Church for
the great number of persons who will
wish to attend the funeral services of
Mrs. Stanford presents many serious
problems to the faculty committee in
charge of the arrangements. The
Memorial Church seats nearly 2000, but
from present indications twice that
number will seek admittance. But
while the capacity of the church is
limited, at the Stanford mausoleum,
where part of the services are to be
held, there is ample room for a con
gregation of many thousands.
The entire student body will be seat
ed in the galleries and in the organ
loft. The main floor will be reserved
in sections for pallbearers, trustees,
faculty, alumni, employes of the estate
and the university, and official repre
sentatives of the many organizations
with which Senator and Mrs. Stanford
were connected during their lives.
There will be little space left in the
church for the general public. One
lower transept has been reserved for
them, with seats for about 500. For
the convenience of the congregation
Vice President Branner of the univer
sity has aprx)inted the following ush

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. MARCH 21. 1905.
EUROPE TO SEE
YACHTING WAR
British Sportsmen Will Try
to Outdo Kiel Begatta in
Waters of Own Country
HIVAL KACES PLANNED
Hope to KeeiÂ» Their Vessels
From Furthering Schemes
of the German Emperor
Special Disratch to The Call.
LONDON, March 20. â Just as the
growth of Germany's naval power has
been met by a redistribution and re
organization of Britain's fleets, .so has
the rapid development of yachting in
Germany, under the stimulating in
fluence of the strenuous Kaiser, led to
the adoption of defensive measures
by British yacht clubs. Their object
is chiefly to induce British yachtsmen
to refrain from participating in the
Kiel regatta, the greatest event of the
yachting season in the Fatherland, by
offi ring them extra inducements to
race In home waters at that time.
The matter Is of interest to Ameri
can yachtsmen because In the past
their boats have contributed materi
ally to the success of the Kiel regatta,
notably last year, when the Ingoraar
covered herself with glory. Now it
is hoped by the promoters of British
rival schemes that they may find more
attractive sport in these waters.
The Kiel week in June conflicts
with the Clyde races, which take
place about the same time. Partici
pation in both is impossible. At
tempts were made to secure such a
rearrangement of dates as would pre
vent this clashing. But William II
declined to listen to such suggestions.
He preferred to play his own game in
his own way. So this year it is to be
a yachting war between the two coun
tries.
BIG REGATTAS PLANNED.
The word has gone forth that Eng
land expects British yachtsmen to do
their duty by patronizing the Clyde
races and boycotting the Kiel regatta.
That this may entail no sacrifice of
sport on their part the Royal London,
the Royal Northern and the Royal
Clyde Yacht clubs, in combination,
haw just completed arrangements for
ocean races from the Solent to the
Clyde Just prior to the opening of the
races there, and back to<*owes in time
for the Cowes week. It is expected
that these ocean races will secure the
entrance of such yachts as would
otherwise participate in the interna
tional race from Dover to Heligoland
for cups offered by the German Em
peror, which precede the Kiel week.
The "Yachtsman," the chief organ
of the sport here, has been largely in
strumental in getting clubs to unite In
support of the new programme.
"It is a very laudable ambition on
the part of the German Emperor to
wish to build up yachting in his own
country," said the editor to your cor
respondent. '"He has accomplished
wonders in that direction, for which
he is entitled to great credit. Every
body knows, of course, that it is not
for the sake of yachting alone that he
devoted himself to it so zealously. It
fosters a national spirit which yields
ready support to his far-reaching na
val schemes. It is too much, however,
to expect that Englishmen should
complacently continue to help him
play his shrewd game at the expense
of the sport in their own waters. But
all racing yachtsmen devoutly wish
that some members of our own royal
family would emulate his example
and take up yacht racing. It would
help the sport here amazingly. Since
the King gave up racing British roy
alty has dropped out of the game en
tirely."
ROYAL SUPPORT LACKING.
That latter is a sore point with
British yachtsmen. While the Ger
man royal family does everything pos
sible to encourage the sport, English
royalty does nothing beyond bestow
ing a few cups. The German Emper
or owns more racing yachts than any
other man in the world. Not content
with that, he insists that every mem
ber of his family, including the Em
press, should own and race at least
one yacht. His relatives as far as he
can influence them are required to do
likewise. Rich men find yacht racing
the surest passport to his favor. Until
he purchased the Thistle, the British
cup challenger which was defeated
by the Volunteer back in the '80's,
German yachts were insignificant in
number and quality. Now there ex
ists a big and imposing fleet enrolled
in the Imperial Yacht Club. The Kai
ser aims at yachting supremacy.
No one understands better the art
of making royal patronage count. At
the Kiel regatta he personally dis
tributes the chief prizes himself;
wines and dines the yachtsmen on his
own little warship which passes mus
ter as the imperial yacht, and chats
with them in free and easy style. The
prizes for the Dover to Heligoland
race are designed by himself and with
his own hand he bestows them on the
winners. And winners and losers
alike are invited to a sumptuous
spread on the Hohenzollern. That
sort of thing counts for a good deal
in these days. It is putting British
patriotism to a severe test to ask it
to forego such brilliant opportunities
of hobnobbing with royalty and con
tent Itself with yacht racing for the
mere sport of the thing with a prob
lematical chance of winning a few
prize mugs.
If King Edward should throw his
influence into the scale and play at
the Clyde regatta the same role that
his august nephew does at Kiel ch.j
matter would be settled decisively.
Eut there is small likelhood that he
will. Last year he attended the Kiel
regatta and a big fuss was made over
him. He and the Emperor exchanged
kisses crd compliments and the King
expressed great gratification at the
growth of German yachting and
hoped he might be able to repeat his
visit next year and all that sort of
thing. If he should go to Kiel thH
year British yachtsmen would feel of
itnded. If he should openly patron
ize the races which have been ar
ranged to diminish the glory of "he
German evetit the Kaiser will feel
hurt. It puts Edward in something of
a dilemma. He will probably get out of
it by leaving both affairs alone on the
pea of pressing engagements else

COURT DEFINES
A GIBSON GIRL
English Jurist Decides She
Must Have Perfect Figure
and a Dress Which Fits
TROUBLE OVER A GOWN
liim of French Musical Plays
to Be Seen Shortly at the
Theaters of Great Britain
Special Disratch to The Call.
LONDON". March 20.â What a "Gib
son Girl" is has just been defined in a
London court of law. Londoners, of
course,, are familiar with the American
artist's ( artoons, but interest in the
Gibson sir! as an entity did not become
keen over here until Camille Clifford
reproduced the damsel's supposed
"walk" in "The Prince of Pilsen." The
business mt-di a hit and when the "Pil
sen" company wtnt back Miss Clifford
remained l-ehind to do her walk in
'The Catch of the Season," Seymour
Hick's play, where she is doing it at
present, supported by ten other "Gib
son Girls."
It was a lawsuit over a stage dress,
however, which caused the character
istics of the Gibson girl to be discussed
in court. The action was taken against
an American actress named Kate
Hardren, who ordered a costume from
a London dressmaker, but didn't pay
fur it. Her defense was that the dress
was unsatisfactory â so much so, in
fact, that she lost an engagement at
thÂ« Palace Music Hall because of it.
She was soinsr to do a Gibson Girl act
at the Palace, but after a trial per
formance the management decided
they didn't want it, and Miss Hardren
blamed it all on the dress. The Judge
before whom the ca=e was tried con
fessed that he didn't know what a Gib
son girl was. and after much solemn
interrogation of various witnesses it
was decided that she was "a girl with
a perfect figure and perfectly fitting
dress." The music hall people were un
kind enough to declare that it was not
her dress but a want of grace in Miss
Hardren's movements which lost her
the engagement, but the learned Judge
decided in her favor on the ground
that if the costume had suited her re
quirements it undoubtedly would have
been paid for.
PIECES FROM PARIS.
Since he returned from the United
States George Kdwardes has been busy
making arrangements for new musical
plays. The success of 'The Duchess
of Dantzic" in both London and New
York and the complete conquest of
audiences here by Messager's "Ve
ronique" has convinced Edwardes that
there is money in French light operas,
and he Is having three more Parisian
successes adapted for him. "Veronlque "
is to follow "The Duchess of Dantzic"
to the United States as soon as its Lon
don run is over and if the new adapta
tions are successful here they will be
seen in America, too.
The first of them is almost ready for
production and will follow "The Cin
galee," which after a run of over a
year at Daly's, is in v its last fortnight.
In French the new piece was called
"Les P'tites Mlchu." The music is by
Messager, and the book has been done
into English by Henry Hamilton, who
wrote "The Duchess of Dantzic." The
play is all about the adventures of
feminine twins and will be called "Two
Little Girls."
The London run of "The Orchid"
isn't finished yet by a long way, but
when it comes to an end Edwardes will
produce at the Gaiety the adaptation
which George Grossmith is now mak
ing of "Le Cog de Printemps," a recent
hit in Paris. It is concerned with a
middle-aged military man's ill-advised
attempt to pursue the enjoyments of
his youth, and at the Gaiety will be
called "The Spring Chicken." Addi
tional numbers are now being written
for it by Ivan Caryll, who composed
The Duchess of Dantzic," and Lionel
Monckton, who wrote "A Country Girl"
and "The Cingalee." When the third
of Edwardes' new plays from the
French will be produced is uncertain.
It is called the "Empress' Dragoons"
and is by the authors of "Madame
Sherry," which was produced in Lon
don about a year ago.
SKIT FROM THE GERMAN.
At the Court Theater, whose mana
gers are trying the experiment of pro
ducing plays with ideas in them, three
one-act pieces are being given this
week The first, "A Pot of Broth," by
W. B. Yeats, is rather too slight to
please ordinary play-goers. The sec
ond is Bernard Shaw's "How He Lied
to Her Husband."
The third play is well worth the at
tention of some American manager. It
is a translation from the German. It
is called "In the Hospital," and its
scene is the extra ward of such an In
stitution in Vienna. There Karl Rade
macher's life is ebbing away. His ca
reer has been a failure. He has worked
hard as a hack Journalist to earn a
scanty wage, and what has made It all
the more bitter is that, while he has
gone down, his old companion, Alexan
der Weihgart, no cleverer or more ca
pable, Rademacher is convinced, has
steadily ascended. His own earnest ae
slre is to meet the man he regards as
his successful rival, to let him know
that his friendship has been a pretense,
that he hates him: and he Is overjoyed
when the doctor consents to ask Weih
gart to come.
There is an actor, Florlan Schubart,
also in the hospital, and he suggests a
rehearsal of the coming scene; he will
be Weihgart â what has Rademacher to
say to him? The writer begins his
venemous tirade. He casts the mask
aside, tells the other what he has long
ed to tell, and winds up with a cruel
stab â Weihgart's wife, he declares, has
been his mistress. Exhausted by the
effort, for his wrath has carried him
beyond his strength, he is lying quietly
back in his chair when Weihgart ar
rives, and begins to talk soothingly, to
lament his old comrade's misfortunes,
to speak of the disappointments and
Irritations that have constantly affected
himself in the midst of his apparent
prosperity; and Rademacher is gradu
ally moved to gentler thoughts. When
the allotted Quarter of an hour has
gone the two Dart in all kindness,
Weihgart never dreaming than any
hard thought has been in his old
friend's mind.
At the Court Theater J. D. Bever
idge, who recently made a hit as the
tutor in "Old Heidelberg," plays Rade
macher with real power, while the part
of the actor is taken by George Trol
lope, who attracted attention in that
striking play, which unfortunately did
not reach America, "A Man of Honor."
FAX TO PLAY ABROAD.
Although for years an adaptation of
"Beside the Bonnie Briar Bush" has
been produced In America, none has
ever been presented in this country.
William Mollison recently secured the
English rights of the American version
and will start a provincial tour with it
early in April. Reuben Fax, who played
"Posty" with so much success in
America, is to be a member of the

MILLIONS FOR
THE CHEROKEES
Court of Claims Decides
That Government Must Pay
Big Sum to the Indians
RESULT OF OLD CASE
Liability Grows Out of a
Treaty Made Seventy Years
Ago With the Aborigines
WASHINGTON, March 20.â The
cases of the Cherokee Indians and of
individual Cherokees against the
United States were decided by the
Court of Claims to-day. They involve
a large amount of money and are of
an unusual and extraordinary char
acter.
The United States bought the Chero
kee outlet, agreeing to pay fqr it $8,
300,000, being about $1 per acre, and
also agreeing to reopen a long stand
ing controversy between the nation
and the Cherokees. In ---5 a treaty
was made under which the Cherokees
were to move or be removed from
Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee to the
Indian Territory. The Cherokees con
tended that before they were removed
under the provisions of the treaty
they were not to be made to pay the
cost of removing from homes which
they did not wish to leave, to a coun
try to which they did not wish to go.
The Government held to the contrary.
When the Cherokee outlet was sold the
Indians' attorneys contended that all
of their accounts should be reopened
and the matter equitably settled, and
for that purpose the United States
should make out an account to the
Cherokee nation. If the Cherokee na
tion adopted it, Congress should im
mediately appropriate for whatever
balance might be found due. The ac
count was adopted, but Congress did
not appropriate the money and for
some time did nothing.
In the present suit the Court of
Claims decides that the account trans
mitted by the Secretary of the Inte
rior followed by thiÃ inaction of Con
gress, readers the United States liable
for the balance of $1,111,284. with inter

approximately to $4,500,000.

A CAUSE FOR THE LAND FRAUDS.
;iking up judgment upon the public land frauds which are be
uisclosed in many Western States, it is permissible to look
part of the causes in the land policy itself. A great many of
â¢ ged frauds are in connection with grazing lands. These have
mlawfully fenced, and in many cases have illegally passed into
be ownership. These things began when use of the public range
".mon reduced its production of forage, and the live stock in
had to survive by craft or expire by the return of the range to
It is easy now to look backward and see that if the Govern
ed long ago adopted the policy of leasing in tracts of proper
- :hr lands fit for grazing and probably for nothing else, reserving
:o cut out of any leasehold lands fit for agriculture or min
hat were needed for irrigation, there would be fewer frauds
-ecute now.
c Agricultural Department long ago saw the necessity for leas
range lands, retaining the title in the Government for asser
at any time, over any leasehold, of land that proved fit for a
">!er purpose. The agrostologists, soil experts and irrigators in the
era! bureaus of that department made expert examination of the
iztng lands. These reports put plainly the progressive spoliation of
forage caused by overstocking, due to occupancy of the land
-ommon by all comers, each anxious only to get as much of the
- he could grab before the desert took it all back again. The
â¢tion of the land has reduced the moisture in the soil, and so
â¢ c ed the ground water that springs once affluent have ceased to
md the normal run-off of streams has been fatally impaired.
So we have these lands physically injured to an extent that will re
â¢ â¢ â¢ section to repair, on the one hand, and on the other we have
â¢ -c of the law in fencing them to secure protection and exclu
â - of the forage that remains, and we have extensive frauds in
their transfer to private ownership.
The sentiment of the country is against the sale of public land
irye tracts to private individuals. A grazing range, however,
si be in such tracts. The live stock business on the range re
quire^ this. Neither sheep nor cattle raising on the range can be
ie profitable on small tracts. As the forage has grown less and
md as. consequently, more range is required, a grazing tract
ha? to be larger every year to support a sufficient number of animals
â la ' pay. It ts to say that if, when the range was virgin,
g policy had been adopted, the average size of a range're
'nake it profitable would have been less than a third of
' -eh is necessary now. If leasing had been possible then, the
would have preserved the stock carrying capacity of his
and the range business, instead of dying by slow starva
lid now be greater than ever and American stock growers
n â¢ be driven to transfer their business to the more liberal
:nity offered by Mexico and the Dominion of Canada. So,
*c who do not expatriate their industry would not now be
the grip of the law and defending themselves against criminal in
â¢ Tit for fencing the public domain or acquiring its ownership
awfully.
Kven now. if the live stock* men would stand together and jointly
jrhten the Government and inform Congress as to the necessities
â¢he situation, about 400.000,000 acres of land, apparently fit only
crazing, and still public domain, could be rescued from the desert
made productive of wealth, under leaseholds. It i<; apparent now
that part of the outcry raised in the West against this policy, pro
fessed to be in behalf of the home-seeker and the homesteader, was
really the voice of the fraudulent land speculator. It appealed to
the sentimental folk in the East and disposed of all doubts in favor
he pretended home-seeker, who proves now to have been the in
:ment selected for the perpetration of frauds upon the Govern
â¢:. The cattle barons and the sheep lords were held up to public
km and contempt and aversion, as intending to grab lands and
!ude the actual settler, because they wanted the protection of a
-ehold for the range lands necessary in their business, and offered
take the lease subject to exclusion therefrom of all lands proved
r home-making by irrigation or natural rainfall.
a . another element in the situation if coming into view. Most
he lands to be irrigated by the Government, lying as they do upon
eh plateaus, where the season is short and winter conditions
â¢ ail. will find their most profitable use in raising alfalfa and other
Bter feed for livestock. Rut this profit cannot be made without
tensive summer range for the animals that will consume the win
ded. This summer range is found only on the grazing lands that
yet part of the public domain. Unless that range is put under
-ehold. to protect its forage plants and renew them for the sup
k. the buyers of the irrigated land will have a restricted
and unprofitable market for the product of their lands. Grain rai<
j <m those irrigated lands ? ,beyond supplying the domestic demaivl,
â <f the question, because the market is remote and transporta
1 high. The forage produced by irrigation will be best marketed
â¢lie animals it feeds. Unle c s the Government reforms its range
1 policy, its irrigation settlements will not realize the expectations
those who buy the land. Under a leasing policy it will naturally
hat owners of the irrigated land who produce winter feed will
so become stock rangers by acquiring leaseholds, and their pros
rky will be assured by putting the summer range and the winter
all in the same control.
We are persuaded that these views of the land problem should
I y the irrigators and the live *tock men, and should
â¢ d until they are heeded and acted upon by the Government
California has a great interest in this question, for our meat sup
ply is drawn from regions outside the State, for hundreds of thou
sands of sheep and cattle. Our lands are devoted to other uses. We
require excellence and stability in the supply, and both will decline
njury unless there is a change of land policy.
A TOURIST HOTEL FOR PLACER.
THE Improvement Association of Placer County has waked up
to the very superior advantages offered by that county for the
attracting of tourist travel and for the "sojourn of people of
leisure. The association proposes to promote the building of a satis- !
fpetory tourist hotel at some point in the county convenient to the
rosd and offering the best climatic and other advantages. Natural
as already picked out Placer County for this purpose.
cry summer hundreds of people from the coast and bay counties
lacer for their vacation. The dry climate, fine air and
water, the good country roads, the scenery and all, make up a lure
ihat is irresistible. Around Applegate, at'an altitude of about 2500
feet, hundreds of people take their summer recreation on ranches
whose proprietors arrange for their entertainment.
It is strange that this natural and voluntary selection of a local
should so long have escaped the attention "of the people of the
v. and of capitalists who invest in country tourist hotel prop
v. A region with sites which command a view of Mount Tallac,
mrt Shasta, the Marysville Buttes and the Sacramento Valley, and
' haÂ« a dry and wholesome air and the finest water, offers every
cement that appeals to the seeker for pleasure and health
Placer County is in many respects the most important part of
lia. It is the gateway county, in which most of the trans
tinental travel sees its first and last of California, and no more
-.utiful, restful and peaceful sight can be had in the world. The
nge and deciduous fruit orchards, the vineyards and olive groves,
teh afar on both sides of the railway. They are in small tracts and
on even' one is a beautiful home, prosperous and happy, in a bower
of flowers and foliage.
It is well that the people are at last aware of these advantages I
J propose to make the most of them. Their example may be fol
lowrd by other fine counties in the formation of strong county im- j
provement associations, charged with the duty of bringing advantages
so familiar to themselves to the attention of the outside world.

Cremating Cupid
EPES W. SARGENT
, ,% SUPPOSE that's all." said Ma
* * I rion dolefully. as the last en-
I velope smoldered upon the
â  open fire.
"Yes," assented Masson. "It's
i like all the rest; blackness and ashes."
"It is a good thing," she sighed.
' "that we found our mistake in time."
"Rather," was the cheerful response.
"It's an awfully good thing. Suppose
'â  we had let things go along until sum
mer time before we found out that we
did not love each other."
"That would have made it just a
year if we had waited until June," she
announced dolefully.
"Yes. indeed," he said cheerfully.
'It would not have been at all ro
mantic to have had to burn all our let
ters in the kitchen stove, with the
cook scolding because we were mak- i
ing such a muss."
"How horrible!" she cried with a
shudder.
'Awfully unromantic." he agreed.
"1 mean," she corrected, "that it was
just horrid of you to suggest such a
thing."
â¢ I didn't suggest it," he defended.
"It was your idea to have this crema
tion of Cupid."
"Jim Masson," she cried, "are you
trying all you know how to wound
me?"
"I don't seem to have to try," he
admitted sadly. "Ever since we be
came engaged I seem to have succeed
ed in nothing else."
"But you are so practical," she com
plained. "You take all the romance
out of life."
"You did not appear to think so
once," he argued.
I idealized you." she admitted. "I
suppose it was the glamour of the birth
of love."
Masson winced. He hated those
hypfi --elegant speeches. "It seems to
me," he suggested, "that love's birth
was registered upon the vital statistics
about the time Adam woke ud and
found Eve by his side."
She gave a start at the suggestion of
vital statistics in connection with love,
it was Masson's matter-of-fact speech
that had led her to ask him to release
her from their engagement.
"Love is born afresh," she corrected
gently, "with each new conquest.
Love is ever old and ever young."
"Yes:," said Masson bitterly, "and
sometimes he's old enough to know
better, when he falls back on that
born again' plea."
"Have you no poetry in your soul?"
she demanded irritably.
"Yes." he admitted calmly. "That's
where I keep it; not on the tip of my
tongue like some of the chaos who
can talk a lot and mean so little."
"Poetry is the expression of a full
heart."
"And an empty head," completed
Masson.
"When love really comes to youâ"
she began.
"It has come." he interrupted. "It
rame to me when I first saw you com
ing down the stairs at the hotel. I
did net know then that you were in
Mrs. Hargreave's party, but I did
know that you were the one woman
in the world for me."
"And yet." she insisted, "you tutvÂ«
placed your business before your
promised wife."
"No," he contradicted. "I have
never done that, but I have gone at
my work with greater spirit because I
knÂ»w that I was working for a home
nnd for the sweetest little woman in
*hr> world."
Marion waved her hand with a help
less pesture of dissent.
"The trouble is." he went on, "that
you thought you were engaged to a
vivified novÂ£], and expected me to talk
like the hero. I cannot."
"That is just it." she interposed
pently. "I saw that you could not
trive me the love I needed and asked
you to break our engagement."
"Cannot you understand," he plead-

THE SUNNY SIDE OF LIFE
HER IDEA.
Mrs. Smith â Did your husband swear
off last New Year's day?
Mrs. Jonesâ Swear! You ought to
have heard him when his collar button
rolled under the bed.
"I suppose tliat Is all," said Ma
rion.
Ed, "that it is because I love you so
much that I cannot talk like a laur
eate? If it was just a flirtation I
could think up all sorts of pretty
things. Now I can only think of you
and â I choke all up," he concluded
lamely.
"You will soon find some one else,"
she smiled tolerantly, "some faithful
soul who will understand and not de
mand too much."
"And you," he cried miserably, "will
marry some addle-pated fool who will
speak honeyed words before you are
married and carry them to some one
else afterward."
"I shall never marry," she said de
cidedly.
â Nor shall I," he cried. "There,"
pointing to the blackened paper in the
grate, "'rbsts my romance. We have
cremated Cupid, but his spirit lives on
here in my heart."
He rose and lightly kissed the broad
white forehead. "I'm sorry." he said
hoarsely, "you could not be t-ontent
with the fact without expression."
Marion rose unsteadily to her feet.
The burning of their old love letters
had appealed to her sense of the ro
mantic. It had afforded her a mourn
ful pleasure. Now something in her
heart spoke insistently. She forgot
that Masson could not make the pret
ty speeches for* which she hungered.
[ For the first time she sensed the
mighty love of the man â a love too
powerful, too deep to find expression
in idle speeches. She realized at last
j what love really was through the de
1 struction of her self-established ideals.
j Masson had almost reached the door.
"Jim," she called softly.
He turned and came forward. In
tone and look he saw what she could
not put in words, and he took her in
his arms.
"And you said we had cremated
Cupid," she said several minutes later.
"Love is like the phenix," he (Uf
| swered tenderly, "rising from the
I ashes purified by the fire through
which he has passed."
"And the phenix." she added,
"lives on for a thousand years."
1 "And love." he concluded, "for an
eternity." â (Copyright, 1905, by E.

on in family consultations without any

MAN IN THE YEAR
6000 B. C.
The length of time man has been
known to inhabit this earth has been
proved to be at least 8000 years. A.
M. Amenlineau has issued the first
volume of the history of his excava-
tlons at Abydos, the sacred residence
of Osiris. Here he has found prehis
toric tombs, and from their contents
he knows that they date back 8000
years. Fortunately for the exolorer,
the Egyptian of that day thought of
death as a state so closely allied to life
that he would have need of all the ne
cessities and comforts he had used
here. Consequently these were placed
beside him in his ' tomb, and from
them the nineteenth century explorer
can tell how the people of the year
6000 B. C. lived, what they ate, how
they dressed and what was the range
of mind and civilization in that an
cient time.
Cereals like wheat and rye prove
the agricultural tastes of these peo
ple. Date stones evidence the growth
of the palm. Ox and gazelle bones
show that these men were not vege
tarians. Decorative instinct was then
alive, for there sre many specimens
of ornaments which show great skill;
beads, metal bracelets and rings of
various sorts. Pottery, both for kitchen
use and for ornament, show that
at first this art was practiced before:
the knowledge of the potters wheel
and afterward with its aid. The fur
niture was found only in fragments,
for most of the wood had rotted away,
but the ivory legs of sofas remained
and are a valuable find. They show
that the hippopotamus, whose tusks
formed these legs, was hunted by
these early Egyptians.
But one illustration shows us how
nearly these people were akin to the
people of to-day. This is the discov
ery in one of the tombs of what must
have served as a baby's nursing bot
tle in that far-away time and place.
It is an earthe n vase with a hole in
the side into which a bit of cloth
could be inserted that the baby might
draw milk from the vase. The ivory
and wooden instruments which were
used to color the eyelids and brows
red and black, so that the eyes might
appear larger, tell us that vanity is at
least 8000 years old.
TO CURE PESSIMISM
Hang these words on your bedpost
or tack them into your brain:
I am now to become an optimist.
From now on I am going to change
my entire life and my style of think
ing.
I â¢ 'I endeavor hereafter to be aen
erous in my view toward otn%rs,
broad-minded, large-spirited and kind,
thinking well everybody, mean of
nobody, and 'overlooking the little
faults, believing that there are other
qualities in the man that overwhelm
the deficiency.
"There is so much bad in the best
of us and so much good in the worst
of us that it behooves each one of us
to be charitable to the rest of us."
I shall see the bright side of every
thing.
I shall talk like an optimist, laugh
like an optimist and move about like
an optimist, conscious of the fact that
I shall radiate sunshine and make
every one around me happier. â Physi

LESS DIVORCE, SAYS CORRESPONDENT, "IF PEOPLE
PUT A LITTLE OF THEIR COURTING BY
FOR A RAINY DAY."
To the Editor of The Call:
Mr. Roosevelt recently told an au
dience of women some homely truths,
gave them plenty of advice, some
philosophy and no encouragement to
get divorced. Our President does not
think divorce improves a nation
much.
A man may make millions but not
be able to pick out a wife fit for a
scavenger. It does not follow because
he has cornered pork or beans or
whisky or coal or oil that he is any
good at finding a wife. Perhaps he
may have been in college all of his
life and be able to read the Assyrian
or Babylonian tablets. How the globe
was forged or the stars were hung he
can tell, can speak a score of foreign
tongues and be ?ilent in all of them
in front of his wife. It does not al
ways require a college education to
select a life partner. Nor it does not
take much effort to make a failure of
married life. Beating your wife over
the head with the furniture will, of
course, break the furniture, but won't
make your wife like you. The same
amount of energy chopping wood or
helping her doing some of her work
will lower the divorce record a little.
Coming home drunk is not what she
likes you to do. It costs much less to

advantage. Her art has ripened,
V-roadened and cleared Itself of some
mannerisms that threatened seriously
to impair it when she was last here.
It is freer, lighter, firmer in touch;
more elastic; more sustained; more fin

Frank TVorthing's "rather dear. silly

th" life. Most easily and subtly every
Tha^e of the character was suggested.
Mast attractively though, he fully ll
â  luniinated most _ the husband's weak
xiees. Mr. Worthing most cleverly bur
gested his thorough likeableness. It was
acting of the best, even more finished
and fluent than one aforetime remem

Mr. McAllister, brought a forensic
* clearness of delivery to the part of
the godfather; indeed. Mr. McAllister
brought handsomely all that was nec

The little, stiff, dry manner suited it- j
self admirably to the part, and alto- |
gether the lawyer-actor showed |
throughout a suppleness and ease J
that are nothing short of remarkable I
for his brief experience. Upon Mr. '
McAllister fell the duty of the one
short speech of the evening, and he '
showed in making it th same aplomb
and naturalness that distinguished '
him throughout the evening. Miss I
Cart wright as the Peruvian person
was another of the distinct hits, and
emphatically "The Marriage of Kit

BLANCHE PARTIN'GTOX.
â¢ Alcazar.
The rain did not prevent the Alca- \
zar Theater from being crowded last
* ::ight. when James A. Herne's inter- J
esting play, "Sag Harbor." was pre- i
sented for the first time in this city by
a stock company. The play appeals
to every one by Its faithful portrayal
of life among the dwellers on the Long
Island coast. The clever Alcazar com
pany made a hit with the production
last night, as every character was ex
ceptionally well delineated by the one
to whom it was assigned. There was
not one drawback, and everything ran
like clockwork. John Craig as Ben
Turner, the plain, honest and loving
bt)at-bullder, gave another Illustration
* of his versatility and a lifelike charac
terization of the part. Fred J. Butler,
as Captain Dan Marble, helped moat
materially in making the piece a suc
cess, and John B. Maher as Freeman
witmarsh did full justice to the com
edy portion of the play. John Sain

disgruntled lover. Miss Lillian Law

Central.
One of the prettiest and best writ
ten melodramas that has been seen
at the Central was presented last
evening to a crowded house, entitled
"Henrts Adrift." It is a quaint story
of life as it is seen every day, with
many elegant scenic embellishments
that were :iot only true to the places
they depicted, but quite out of the

John T. Chick and his clever little

hit at the Chutes yesterday with their
condensed domestic comedy. "Is Mar

action and snap in the skit, which
whs received with shrieks of laughter.
Camilla and Forna gave a good equili

Australian magician, made all kinds of
objects appear and disappear in most
startling fashion. Clayton Fryp and

BODY OF I NKNOWN MAN IS

Another Mystery of the Sea Is Added
to Ix>ng List of Similar
Occurrences.
The body of an unknown man was
cast up on the beach yesterday after
noon just below the Cliff House. A
crowd of curious seekers soon collect
ed and advanced all kinds of theories
as to who and what he might be.
Some suggested that a horrible crime
had been committed, and he had
been thrown Into the sea to cover up
the deed. Others thought he was a
sailor who had fallen overboard from
some ship. By the time that the
crowd had given full vent to expres
sions of their thoughts the ambulance
arrived and the body was taken to
the Morgue. - The body looks as if :it
had been in the. water for two weeks.
The man was dressed in shoes, socks,
drawers and white shirt. He looked
to be about 60 years old, weighed
about 185 pounds and was 5 feet 9
inches In height. This adds another
mystery of the sea.

An army of carpenters, painters and

safe to say that nothing of a like na

Such an exhibition would be impos
sible under private enterprise. The
gathering of exhibits, the detailing of a
squad of soldiers, and a landing party
of sailors and marines, the sending of
a dozen families of Navajo Indians
from the reservation and the transpor
tation of the immense quantities of
material could be done only through
the agency of the prominent citizens
handling the affair. At every hand will
be found evidence of the strong per
sonality of the nature lovers who hayÂ»?
given their time and money to the pro
motion of an enterprise for charity.
Through the highest officials in Wash
ington many of the favors have come,
and the result will be a wonderful ex
hibition.
Indian Agent Paraquette will be in
charge of the Navajos, and he has se
lected only the industrious families
to make the trip. All the little arts
for which this tribe is famous will be
shown during the exhibition. They will
weave baskets, make their famous
blankets, do their pottery and quaint
filagree silver work and manufacture
toys. Indian mothers will not leave
their children, so a goodly array of
pappooses will come along and add to
the interest of the exhibit. They will
camp on the banks of the lake during
the entire two weeks of the show. A
special tourist car has been provided
for their transportation.
The soldier and sailor features will
be almost as interesting. For the sol
dier detail there will be two hospital
sergeants and two Red Cross nurses in
charge of a hospital marquee, a guard
and commissary tent. In the landing
party of marines will come the regular
paraphernalia with a Gatling gun.

dues at 75 cents per month.
A fixed scale of daily wages will be
agreed upon for carpenters over fifty

MARSHALL ENTERS DENIAL
TO ARZAVK'S ALLEGATIONS
Kays He Is Not Unlawfully Restrain
ing Mrs. Marshall of Her
liberty.
Richard D. Marshall and Robert

rior Court yesterday in which they
vehemently deny the allegations of
Juan Arzave that they are unlawfully
restraining aged Juana Marshall of
her liberty and that they have com
pelled her to sign a will in their fa
vor. The affidavits, which were filed
to supply a basis for a motion to set
aside a restraining order heretofore
issued on the affidavit of Ramon Na
redo, set forth the allegation that the
only interest the affiants have in Mrs.
Marshall is to prevent her falling the
victim of designing persons who are
after her gold.
A motion to set aside the restrain
ing order was made this morning be
fore Judge Kerrigan, but went over
till Friday. At that time Marshall
will endeavor to show that he should
be granted letters of guardianship
over Mrs. Marshall, and in support of
his petition will point to the recent
allegations of Mrs. Marshall that
some one had attempted poison her as
evidencing the fact that some one
should be named to properly care for
her and her property.

Year's Growth of Transpor

Rank of Those in City
HOLDS FIRST ELECTION
Contest for Presidency Pro
duces Opposing Ticket, but-
Fullest Harmony Prevails
The Transportation Club of San
Francisco passed through the ordeal of
its first election yesterday without the
rupture of one friendship or the dis
gruntling of a single member. The
harmony and good-fellowship prevail
ing from the foundation of the organ
ization, bringing it to the front rank
among the important clubs of the city,
ran through the whole day's balloting.
There was no dissatisfaction over the
result.
The regular ticket contained the
names of W. R. Alberger, chief clerk
of the traffic department of the Santa
Fe; L. F. Cockroft, general passenger
agent of the Oceanic Company; D. R.
Sessions, claims adjuster of the South
ern Pacific, and J. C. Tice, assistant
general agent of Wells-Fargo Com
pany. The opposition was represented
by John A. Gill, Pacific Coast freight
agent of the Lake Shore Road; Dr. A.
W. Morton of the Stnta Fe medical
staff; C. F. Runyon, general manager
of the Mill Valley and Mt. Tamalpais
road, and C. E. Stokes, agent for
Cooks.
NEW JHKrXTORS ELECTED.
The voting began at noon. L. M.
Fletcher, once a railroad man, but now
secretary of the State Board of Trade,
was the first to deposit a ballot at this
the first election of the club. John A.
Gill, F. A. Tibbitts and W. E. Thomp
son followed him closely and there was
desultory voting throughout the day,
with a lively rush for the ballot-box
during the evening hours. A. H. Moffitt
of the Oceanic Steamship Company
presided at the box from 12 to 3, B. A.
Harnett of the Pacific Mail Company
from 3 to 6, and George Fraser of the
Southern Railway from 6 to 9.
The four nominees on the regular
tfrket were elected. With the five'
holdovers they will elect a president
and other officers to-day. The hold
over directors are H. W. Adams, S. F.
Booth, W. H. Davenport, C. D. Dunann
and Charles D. Taylor.
It was supposed that George J. Brad
ley, commercial agent of the Southern
Railway, who is now president of the
club, desired a second term, but he
created a surprise last night at the
annual meeting by announcing that he
would not be a candidate. C. C. Crane
is an active candidate, W. R. Alberger
is looked on as a possibility and S. F.
Booth is a likely dark horse. The other
incumbents. First Vice President H.
K. Gregory, Second Vice President W.
J. Shotwell, Secretary Walter R. Kneiss
and Treasurer Henry Avila, will prob
ably all be re-elected.
The success of the Transportation
Club is a high testimonial to the char
acter of the men who compose it and
those who were chosen to direct its
destinies during the first year of its
existence. It was organized a year ago
Saturday with 145 charter members,
among them being such men as Charles
S. Fee. William Sproule. W. A. Bis
sell, Edward Chambers, C. D. Dunann,
J. A. Horsburg Jr., H. K. Gregory, C.
J. Jones and F. B. Houghton. The or
ganizers met in the Maple room of the
Palace. On June 1 the club rented
parlors A and B in the hotel as tem
porary quarters. The membership
grew rapidly, the leading railroad men
of the city being anxious to join, and
there are now 26J names on the roll.
On November 15 the organization en
gaged the sumptuous rooms on the
ground floor of the Palace formerly oc
cupied by the Union! League Club,
where it is now established with all
the comforts and luxuries of a modern
organization of this nature. It has
proved of great benefit to the trans
portation mÂ«n of the city, not only in a
social but in a business way, giving
opportunity for exchange of ideas.
MEMBERS PROI'I) OF GROWTH.
The members are very proud of the
year's progress of the club, which
forms a record seldom equaled by sim
ilar organizations. Upwards of $16,000
has been expended during the year and
there is a large surplus in the treas
ury. The club has all sorts of pros
perity staring it in the face for the en
suing year.
The four directors who will retire
are F. W. Thompson, general Western
agent of the Chicago and Fiock Island;
P. K. Gordon, passenger agent of the
Piedmont Air Line; W. T. Hunter,
traveling agent of the Chicago and
Northwestern, and C. J. Jones, assist

The case of Anthony Curtin, known
as the "Babe," was on Judge Cook's
calendar for trial yesterday. Curtin
failed to appear and the Judge issued
a bench warrant for his arrest, fixing
his bonds at $5000. The Judge was
subsequently informed that Curtin
was serving a sentence of thirty days
in Tacoma for petty larceny, so he did
not forfeit his bonds. Detective T. L.
Ryan will probably be sent to Tacoma
to bring Curtin back on the expiration
of his sentence.
Curtin, who is an ex-convlct, Is
waiting trial on a charge of burglary.
He and Clarence Franklin, alias Fal

Chnmber of Commerce Meets
MaÂ» Who Has Important
Mission on This Coast
John L. Bristow, Commissioner ap
pointed by President Roosevelt to learn
and report all about the relations of
the Panama Railroad and Panama
Steamship line to commerce, met yes
terday afternoon with the trustees of
the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce. The reporters who were pres
ent were requested to leave the room
when the conference was about to take
place. This they did and the proceed
ings went on for two hours or more
with doors.
The explanation that was given for
keeping the newspapers out when a
matter of such great public concern
was under discussion was that those
participating would talk more freely
and give more information than if the
doors were open to all. Those present
with Commissioner Bristow were:
George A. Newhall, president of the
Chamber of Commerce; W. J. Dutton,
William L. Gerstle, George D. Gray,
James Rolph, Henry Rosenfeld, Rufus
P. Jennings and William R. Wheeler.
George A. Newhall was appointed a
press committee of one. After the pro
ceedings he announced that there had
been considerable discussion and that
another meeting at the trustees of the
Chamber of Commerce would be held
to-day, also with closed doors.
A closed session will be held, at
which shippers and also representatives
of transportation companies will be
present by invitation of the Chamber
of Commerce. When this session has
been finished an invitation will be sent
out to all who have information to im
part to attend a public hearing or
hearings. No one at the meeting of
the trustees of the Chamber of Com
merce yesterday was authorized to
make any report concerning it. with
the exception of Mr. Newhall.
After the first conference Commis
sioner Bristow was interviewed at the
St. Francis Hotel. He said that he
desired to learn all that he can about
the commercial relations of the Pan
ama Railroad to the commerce of the
Pacific Coast. He also said that he
hoped that all who had information
that would tend to enlighten him would
give it.
"I have no plan to suggest," said Mr.
Bristow. "I am simply a seeker for in
formation. I will get all that I can
here and will then go north."

and frequently appendicitis.
To meet this trouble Grape-Nuts food was invented. In it the starch part of wheat and barley is
transformed by long soaking, warmth and time into svgar â just the same method as the body em-
ploys in digestion. Hence when one eats Grape-Nuts he eats a pre-digested food, ready for imme-
diate digestion and assimilation, supplying the body with the needed food elements in a soluble and
-: delicious form. â¢ .
The London "Lancet" says:
"The features worthy of note In our analysis are the excellent
proportion of proteid, mineral matters and soluble carbo-hydrates
per cent. The mineral matter was rich in phosphoric acid. 'Grape-
Nuts' is described as a brain and nerve food, whatever that
may : mean. Our analysis, at any rate, shows that it ia a nutri-
tive of a high order, since it contains the constituents of a
complete food in very satisfactory and rich '_. proportion and in
an easily assimilable state."
r v The food is naturally pre-digested by heat, moisture and time. The diastase is thus pro-
r duced, and V the transformation of starch ] into sugar accomplished.

digest, ordinary bread and starchy food.

LOOKS SERIOUS
FOR GOUCHER
Assistant District Attorney
Ashe Makes Opening Argu
ment for the Prosecution
DEFENSE IS VERY WEAK
Aged Father of the Prisoner
to Make a Plea for His
Wayward OffspringTo-Day
By a process of elimination. Assist
ant District Attorney Ashe. who made
the opening argument for the prosecu
tion yesterday in the Goucher trial be
fore Judge Cook, attempted to show
that it is indisputable that Policeman
Eugene C. Robinson was killed by bul
lets from the pistols of Frank Woods
and Allan, alias "Kid," Goucher.
The morning session began with a
denial by the court of a motion by the
defense to strike out all testimony re
lating to any conspiracy between the
defendant and the gang that had pre
viously been brought to trial. Upon
this denial the defense began introduc
ing witnesses to show the previoua
good record of Allan Goucher before
1900, and rested its case at 3 in the
afternoon. The defense relied mainly
upon the testimony that the night was
partly cloudy and the defendant could
not have been recognized. The assist
ant District Attorney then began the
argument, which lasted until 4:30.
Ashe submitted that three proposi
tions only are to be considered: The
killing of Robinson; who killed him,
and the strength of corroborative tes
timony. In concise form he maintained
that the gang had held frequent meet
ings to plan the robbery of Cypress
Lawn Cemetery and that they pur
chased weapons for self-defense. He
then said that Woods, already con
victed of the murder, and Goucher
were appointed guards to protect the
inside men and were therefore more
heavily armed. He told the story of
the failure of the gang at the ceme
tery and their return to the city.
Then he argued that the conspiracy
was not at an end, as nothing was
introduced to show that the gang had
given up hope of robbery, and in fact,
that they did attempt footpad work.
Ashe then told of the cries that at
tracted the attention of Robinson, his
appearance, and the fusillade of shots
that killed him and attracted the wit
nesses who saw the men run away.
Testimony, he said, had been intro
duced to show that at the first shots
Kennedy. Kaufman and Courtenay ran.
while Henderson refrained from firing,
and that therefore the shots lodging In
Robinson's body were from the revol
vers of Woods and Goucher.
The reliance of the defense upon the
state of the weather on the night of
the tragedy and the introduction of
witnesses as to the defendant's char
acter in Fresno are believed to be a
weak defense. To-day the argument
for the defense will begin at 10 o'clock
and a speedy termination of the trial
is expected.

Plumber's Daughter Basely
Maltreated While on Her
Way Home in After
noon From School Room
Little 7-year-old Alice Armstrong,
daughter of J. M. Armstrong, a plumb
er living at 5 Zoe street, lies in a crit
ical condition at her home, the victim
of the brutal assault of an unknown
man. Detective Tom Gibson Is look
ing for the child's assailant, but has
little clew to work upon.
The little girl was on her way home
from the Whittier Grammar School
about 2:30 yesterday afternoon, when
she was accosted by a strange man.
The stranger gave her a nickel and
enticed the child into a vacant bouse at
263 Perry street. In the basement of
the building the brute smothered thÂ«
baby's cries and brutally assaulted
her. Alice was left to find her way
from the house, the flend having made
good his escape. On the street the
crying child was met by some women,
who turned her over to Policeman Mc-
Dowell. McDowell accompanied her to
her home. Dr. W. F. Friedhofer of
2007 Howard street was called in and
pronounced the girl's condition as ex
tremely serious. He has grave doubts
as to whether the little one will sur
vive her injuries. The baby's head and
neck were terribly scratched and lac
erated by the felon's hands.
Every policeman in the southern dis
tricH is working in league with the de
tectives and they hope to apprehend
the man. The little girl's assailant ia
described as being about 30 years of
age. light-complexioned and of medium
build.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 21, 1905.
JOCKEY MICHAELS SUSPENDED
FOR A QUEER LOOKING RIDE
COLLECTOR OESSUP SHOULD HAVE WON
Gold Enamel Again
Plays in Very
Hard Luck.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
It isÂ» more than likely that a start
at Oakland yesterday for which Jake
Ho'.tman was blameless spoiled a
pretty good thing. Business had been
only so so with the books for two
races, but there were, unmistakable
signs of a busy market when odds were
Chalked up on the Futurity course run,
in which Collector Jessup appeared as
a starter. On all "dope" of the past,
present and future the Collector stood
out like a three-button cutaway at a
full dress ball, and even then his price
went from 3 to 5 to 7 to 10. The coin
of the Smarttown delegation fell into
the books on Gold Enamtl lik? rain
dripping from the house eaves, forcing
the odtls about the Miller colt from
threes to 13 to 5. It seemed like asking
a good deal of tho colt taking his local
form as a standard to go by, but there
must have beÂ«n a reason for the
plunge. Delajjoa received slight con
sideration and, of course, the other two
starters, Oronte and Peggy O'Neil, be
longed in less swejl society. Gold
Enamel, never a perfect gentleman at
the barrier, was up to all of his rowdy
tactics. When Holtman released the
barrier he started for the university
campus via the outer rail and poverty
row, and was left. They can be heard
yet, that Smarttown delegation, and
what they said about Jake Holtman
will some day be published in comic
almanac form and issued at Dawson
City, where the weather is always
cool.
Then Harry Michaels, who rode Col
lector Jessup, felt it up to him to do
something, and he did it. Harry went
out in front and rode a waiting race.
If he had been waiting for the last
Geary-street car to cut loose from its
moorings the jockey could not have
displayed more patience.
FAVORITE IS NOSED OUT.
He was rewarded, for Tooman, who
had been working overtime on Delagoa,
finally drove up in season to get a head
decision over the favorite. The book
makers were pleased for only a few
left-handed bettors played the winner.
Michaels' riding will be confined strict
ly to street cars and ferry boats for a
time. The judges were so overwhelm
ingly delighted at his effort that they
suspended him. J. A. Murray, the
millionaire owner of Collector Jessup,
was not present to see his horse obtain
second money.
Aside from this smash up, every
thing moved along very smoothly.
Whereas, the track was expected to be
muddy and sloppy, it was slow and
heavy. Two public choices were suc
cessful.
With a field of sixteen cheap platers
starting in the opening scramble, it
looked like sticking one's hand in a
grab bag to pick the winner. Still at
that the favorite in the first betting
won. Emshee, played from 10 down to
4 to 1 favoritism at post time, was slow
to leave the barrier, and ran fourth.
Lloyd Fountain rode a patient race on
Riesca, beating out Glen Brier a head
at the wire. Brown Patsy finished
third.
Hoag & Co.'s Billy Taylor looked a
legitimate favorite for the "split" of
the first event. He also had Fountain
in the saddle, and with good racing
luck throughout, won cleverly from
Pachuca, the Napa Stock Farm entry,
a 15 to 1 shot in the ring. Wright
managed to finish third with Flo Ma
nola.
ANVIL IAX)MS IP IN LEAD.
Any time the track is slow and
heavy Anvil is a good horse to take a
chance on. Backed down a shade from
3 to 1, Wright had the gelding out in
the lead from start to finish in the
mile and a sixteenth selling number,
defeating Barney Dreyfuss by less than
a length. Modicum ran an indifferent
third, while Esherin, the favorite,
could not shake up a gallop in the go
ing. Matt Hogan weakened the last
sixteenth of the journey.
Jakie Jones on Edrodun, second
choice for the six and a half furlong
selling run, outgeneraled little Graham
or Batidor, a 25 to 1 shot, would have
been returned the winner. The outsid
er developed more of a fancy for the
stiff going than either Albemarle, the
favorite, or Edrodun. He passed the
latter turning into the stretch and ap
parently had the race in hand. At the
paddock Jones made a last-call effort
with Edrodun and little Graham, grow
ing anxious, drew his whip. He lost
instead of gaining by the move, Jones
landing his mount first by a head. AJ
bemarle finished third. Meada dis
played a flash of early speed and re
tired.
Only four lined up in the concluding
mile Durse event, Gateway closing fa
vorite over Forest King. Judge looked
dangerous for three-quarters of the
way, when Bell, astride the first choice,
assumed the leading position. At the
close Jones came with a late rush on
Forest King, failing, however, to over
take Gateway, who scored by half a
length. With any sort of handling Big
Beach would have cleaned up.
TRACK NOTES.
Johnny McCafferty, brother of C. C.
McCafferty, who has been racing* a
stable of horses at Ascot Park, was
a visitor at Oakland yesterday.
Louis Ezell has had W. R. Condon
fired and he will leave the Burns
handicap winner in California until
next season. Flying Torpedo will also
be left here.
Lloyd Fountain rode the first two
winners on the card.

GOTHAM'S LATEST CRAZE
Newest of All Gambling: Devices Will

To-Day.
NEW YORK. March 20.â New
York is promised a wireless poolroom
afloat beginning to-morrow, and the
news created so much excitement on
Broadway to-night that the wireless
wire-tapper and the seagoing "cinch"
are looked for as "sure things" of the
near future.
H. S. Smith, said to be the represen
tative of well-known bookmakers, ap
plied for a permit to carry passen
gers to sea on the sidewheel steamer
Mount Desert. This vessel may be li
censed to carry 1000 persons in addi
tion to her crew of seventeen. Who
are backing the novel enterprise has
not been made known, and the secret
of the point of departure of the Mount
Desert is still kept by the projectors.

Johnny Crowe, the cleverest ama

Jack McLaughlin, the English borf

VBilly McDonald in the special event,
while Harry Tenny and Johnny Mur

WORK ON ROAD
PLEASES HART
Big Kentucky Boxer Takes
to the Park Highways in
Spite of Bain and Slush
APPEARS FIT TO FIGHT
Jack Johnson Putting the
Finishing Touches on His
Trainingâ Will Be Beady
In spite of the bad condition of the
park roads, Marvin Hart would not be
deprived of outdoor work yesterday
morning, and the usual ten miles were
covered in jig time. The big Kentuek
ian is a glutton for road work, and,
unlike most pugilists, his object seems
to be to get over the ground as quickly
as possible. The pace he sets through
the park would lead one to believe he
was training for a hundred-yard dash
instead of a twenty-round fight. He
never diminishes his speed and always
finishes strong.
At the present time Hart is rid of all
surplus flesh. With the fight still a
week off he is as near being on edge
as Trainer McCormlck cares to have
him. Hart Is such an easy man to
train that the finishing touches will
not be put on until just before flght
night.
Although practically a stranger to
the local fight fans, the Southern
fighter will not lack supporters when
the betting opens. Those who have
seen him at work were favorably im
pressed with his ever aggressive style
and the ease with which he hustles
about such big men as Jack Mc-
Cormick and Al Kaufman. He also
boasts a record that might serve as a
convincer that he is not a fighter of
the Jack Munroe type. He won thir
teen of his first fourteen fights by
knocking his opponets out and the
other was won on a foul. He lost but
two decisions in thirty-three ring en
counters and has met all the high-class
flsticists in the country.
Hart's record has no terrors for Jack
Johnson, however. Jack's little ring
history is something to boast of. it
self, and as far as past performances
go, their records are nearly a stand
off- The big colored scrapper never
looked better, and the amount of work
he does every day without turning a
hair is proof of the fact that he will be
in condition to go the route on the
evening of the 2Sth.
The sporting fraternity is already
discussing the contest and interest in
the bout promises to be at the boiling
point long: before the two gladiators
make their appearance in the ring.

ting-greens and hole out. The lady

balls in the fewest strokes will be the

Target Cracks Compete.
OMAHA, March 20. â A three days*

REV. GEORGE" W. ; WHITE, D. D. |
ADDRESSES BISIXEÂ«S 3^6n
Ijtrfce AttPndnnro at Noonday Lenten
Service â â¢ the Chamber of
Commerce.
Thp Rev. Geouge W. White, D. D.,
paÃtor of Central Methodist Episcopal
church, delivered the Lenten address
yesterday at the noon meeting for
business men in the Chamber of Com
merce assembly hall, Merchants' Ex
change building. There was a large
attendance.
Dr. White gave a practical exegesis
of the narrative of the rich young
man who came to Christ asking what
he should do to inherit eternal life.
The address emphasized the truth
that morality differs from religion in
that the first pertains only to earthly
affairs and would be just as import
ant if there were no hereafter and no
God, while religion deals with man's
personal relations to the Diety, show
ing that the giving of personal loyal
ty and love to God is the only return
men can make for all that he receives
from Him. If this is withheld, said
Dr. White, no matter what men do for
each other, they have robbed God.
The Rev. G. G. Eldredge, pastor of
St. John's Presbyterian Church. wIU
be the speaker at noon to-day and
the Rev. Ernest Bradley, rector of
St. Stephen's, will conduct* the service
to-morrow.
When the Lord created woman he
didn't use a magazine fashion plate
for a pattern.

OFFICE FORCE
City Engineer Woodward in
Need of/ $26,200 to Be
Spent on Thoroughfares
WAITS ON WOBKS BOARD
Money Will Be Expended in
Paying Extra Salaries and
to Purchase Supplies
City Engineer Woodward yesterday
addressed a communication to/ the
Board of Public Works Informing that
body of the needed work on sewers and
pavements of various streets in the
city. He asks that 5 per cent of the
money realized from the sale ot bonds
be donated for the purpose of carrying
on the work. Woodward estimates
the cost at $26,210, which is 6 per cent
of the total, $524,200. Following Is his
communication to the Board of Pub
lic Works.
March 20. 1906.
To the Honorable the Board of Public
Works of the City and County of San Fran
cisco â Gentlemen: In the construction of tha
sewers and pavements provided for in the bond
issue, and for which bonds have already been
Â»oIU, it will be necessary to set aside, out of
the sum of money derived from such bonds for
such construction and as a part of the cost
thereof, an amount for the engineering, Inspec
tion and equipment incident to the perform
ance of the work. In accordance with your
verbal instructions I have Investigated the
matter and would recommend that 5 per cent
of the total money available be appropriated
for such purposes. This percentage may be
increased or decreased In future appropria
tions as developments in the actual construc
tion work shall determine. The bonds already
sold amount to 9281,200 for sewers and tMS.
'â â Â»Â« ror pavements, a total of $524,200, S per
cent of which is $28,210.
It is assumed that more bonds will be sold
and that work under the bond issue will con
tinue for some years. It is, therefore, neces
sary that a special force be engaged In this
offke, which shall devote Itself entirely to
such work. The staff recommended for the or
ganization of the force, with the monthly sala
ries suggested, is as follows:
One assistant engineer in charge of sewers.
$200; one assistant engineer in construction of
sewers. ?16O; three draughtsmen on sewers,
9585: one assistant engineer In charge of pave
ments. $175; one assistant engineer in charge
nf diagrams $150; one draughtsman clerk,
$12T>; one assistant to chemist. $100: one sur
veyor, $150: three field assistants. $245; one
stenographer. $7r>: one horse and buggy. $35;
eijcht field Inspectors, $*00; total per month,
J2.-.55.
In addition to the above it will be necessary
to allow about $1500 for a mechanical engineer
and Â£2000 for instrument? and supplies.
While the above list is as accurate as pos
sible to forecast at the present time It Is ten
tative both as to the number of employes and
the amount of their salaries, which will be In
irrased or decreased as may be required by the
exigencies which may arise and by the amount
of improvements in progress from time to
time. For example, the full forge of field in
spectors will not t>e needed for several months
and the mechanical engineer will be called
upon only when his services are required. If
no more sewer bond? are sold the services of
some of the engineers and draughtsmen can
be dispensed with after the completion of thÂ»
plans at present under rrriFideratinn. On the
â  tbM hand, if a iargrr amount of bonds are
sold and a lnrger amount of work is expected
t'. be done. It will be necessary to increase the
force and In some rases the salaries. Very re
spectfully, THOMAS P. WOODWARIX
rtty Engineer.

COLONISTS AUK POURING
INTO STATE FROM EAST
More Than Ton Thousand Tourists
; ; Arrive During V the - Last Six. -
, teen Days. . j
. Figures given 1 out yesterday 1 by
Chief Train Agent Lund of the South
ern ; Pacific â  Company show that dur
ing sixteen days since the colonists 5
rates : became operative a total -of â¢ 10.
600 persons : have entered California
over the V, lines of * that company. :; " Of
this number 7 114 f- were ;. turned ' over to
the -Southern pacific Company by "1 the
Santa Fe, 3929 came by way l - of El
Paso, 589. via Portland and 5938 â by
.way of :Ogden. v â ';;â  â .â¢", : / . - :
The company has been making a
careful study of the character of the
people who have been availing them-
Felves of the cheap rate to the State,
and by interviews with the travelers
and other means of getting informa
tion it has been discovered that the
class of people now coming into the
State is much higher than those who
came here when the rates were first
inaugurated several years ago. The
men are possessed of greater funds
and have determined to permanently
locate in California.
Deny Charge of Fraud.
Truman Reeves and E. P. Colgan. I
against them and Elizabeth Heed by j
defendants in the action instituted !
Klla A. (Juinley, have filed an answer â 
to plaintiff's complaint. They deny
the allegation of Mrs. Quinley that
Elizabeth Reed, acting for them, de
frauded her of $1300 by getting her to
invest this amount in the "Prudential
Company." They also deny that they
loaned any of the funds of the com
pany, as Mrs. Quinley alleges, to the
Ralston Gold Mining Company,
"which company was hopelessly in
solvent."
FEDERAL LINE
IS INTRENCHED
Indication That Incumbent
Office Holders Will Con
tinue to Serve the Public
PERKINS AND FLINT
All Accounts Agree That
Congressman J. K. Know
land 1 Is Making a Record
General George Stone, chairman of
the Republican State Committee, re
turned from the national capital yes
terday. He attended the inaugural
ceremonies and had a talk with the
President. United States Senators
George C. 'Perkins and Frank P. Flint
are on the way home and will prob
ably arrive in California next Friday.
George flatten, chief of Senator Per
kins' political bureau, has Just re
turned from Washington, D. C. It is
reported that the Junior Senator Frank
P. Flint has made an excellent im
pression in the Senate.
All accounts agree that Congressman
Joseph R. Knowland, who succeeded
Victor H. Metcalf as the representa
tive of the Third California District,
has "caught on" in fine shape. Mr.
Knowland's effective work in the
House in obtaining money for the
equipment of Mare Island navy yard
is highly commended. The Secretary
of the Navy and the Chief of Construc
tion were not In favor of allowing a
large sum of money for equipment of
the yard. Undaunted by opposition in |
high places, Mr. Knowland applied \
himself diligently to the task of over
coming opposition. The element* of i
personal popularity with which the
young representative is so amply en
dowed counted largely in his favor. I
Senator Perkins was especially delight
ed over the support rendered by Mr.
Knowland. On the floor as well as in
the committee room the representa
tive of the Third District displayed
tact and exhibited qualities of leader
ship.
The notion that General Stone went
to Washington to seek appointment to
Federal office is misleading. When the
President kindly inquired what he
wanted for himself Stone frankly re
plied that he was not an aspirant for
any position. The chairman of the
State committee and Senators Perkins
and Flint Incline to the opinion that
the changes in the Federal offices in
California will be few. Applicants for
the position of Naval Officer have
finally reached the correct conclusion
that there will be no opening for ap
pointment in that quarter unless Col
onel Irish dies or resigns. Moreover
it is said that the incumbents of the
offices respectively of Sub-Treasurer,
Surveyor of Customs. United States
Marshal, Superintendent of the Mint
and Appraiser will hold over or be re
appointed. The idea that Chauncey M.
St. John is an applicant for the office
Of Surveyor of the Port is rated as
absurd. Mr. St. John went to Wash
ington on a regular vacation and timed
his trip so that he could attend the
ceremonies of inauguration of the Pres
ident.
The appointment of Robert T. Dev
lin, United States District Attorney,
was brought about by the request of
Senators Perkins and Flint. The At
torney General was strongly in favor
of retaining the services of Mr. Wood
worth and the high character of the
latter's indorsements deeply Impressed
the President.
Me Donald Having a Good Time.
W. J. McDonald, proprietor of the
Gilroy Hot Springs, has been in the
city for a few days and has been
making things lively in the "tender
loin." He was arrested on Saturday
afternoon by Policeman Harry Hook
on a charge of disturbing the peace.
He was in a saloon on Ellis street and
broke glasses and otherwise amused
himself. He was bailed out, but fail
ed to appear in Police Judge Conlan's
Court yesterday morning. Yesterday
afternoon he was again raising a dis
turbance in saloons on Ellis street and
Hook again arrested him and locked
him up in the City Prison.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 20.â The effects were
perceptible in to-day's stock, market of some
benevolent Â«upervisi<aÂ»Â» which had the effect of
diEcouraging aggression by the bear party.
The buring which checked the decline, how
e\-er, hesitated to follow prices when they
turned upward and thÂ« speculative,, operators
who attempted -to hush' th* advance, found
themselves In scant)- companion. The result
was a perloa of dullness in the trading, and a
Barrow. rg in the fluctuations, prices showing
i. tendency to settle to about last week's doe
ing Tat imprÂ«-ssjon was impressed of an ef
fort to hold viÂ« present situauon on an even
keel Trbile awaLitlng thÂ« solution of tome of
the doubtful t actors in the outlook. : The;
party of â action were somewhat aggrttatve in
the ear!y part of the day until checked by the
measures of support In the market. With the
reaction checked (one of the old rumors of
deals Ehowed renewed vitality, notably that
elieging a plan for a holding company for
the V&nderbllt property and for the combina
tion cf New York Central, Northwestern and
Union Pacific Tbe Northern Securities case
also showed a remnant of Its strong hoid .on
spocul&tive sentiment wiiÂ«n tbe intimation was !
olrculatec that tbe Supreme Court 'was likely
to conclude the case by issuing its mandate
to-da.y for the carrying out of th* decision.
The renewed signs of depression shortly after
noon were clearly to tie news of the adjourn
ment c' the court over the recess without is
suing its mandate. About the same time there
apr e&red official disclaimer* of the New York
Central rumors, also pointing out th* ateenoe
j â¢? directors to secure a quorum of .the board.
tracb 41srla:m*rs have often, been Issued in the
midst of the most exalted periods of the late
ris* without attracting the slightest attention. '
Their greatest effect to-day was an index of
the subdued spirit of speculation. Attention
o. r. versed in the money market owing to the '
low state of thÂ« bank real and the expect
ed growth of an interior demand for currency.
The extreme activity in all lines of business
itself promises to Increase this demand, and
any ma&erlaJ Inroad on money supplies would
be expected to affect unfavorably th* stock
market. There was no errttenc* of lack of
(oasts' ta-Ct-r, although rates .were well main
ta'.nefl Of general news ths condition report*
â¢i '.rote si. quarter* were brilliant. Th* ton*
of review* of traffic conditions by railroad of
ficials was fairly enthusiastic the â¢ only com>
pl&iat being of a shortage of oars with which
to meet the extraordinary business offering.
Stocks of merchandise are reported . low owing \
to former hesitation about reordering, and or
ders are reported to be oomtnc now In an oh
Â»â  him as to promise a cist of railroad tra,fflo
for some time to come. Saggeetlocie were pot
out of as early payment of accrued dividends
an Republic StÂ«ei provferred. and that stock
made a spurt, carrying Tenaewee Coal with It
la sympathy Bocae renewed oredenc* ' was
riven, therefore to the story of the u*ei#w of
Southern iron, companies. The railroad equip
ment ttoofc* were is demand. Intimations of 4.
newly foand value of th* Canadian PaclSo
lands toy reâ on of oil discoveries caused an
extended rise in that stock, and contributed
with the moverriw.t In the Southern Iron stocks
to the rtrong cloving and activity at the best
j prioac 'of the day- â¢

OFT TOLD TALE
IS TOLD AGAIN
Michael Conniff Snes City
for the Ninth Time for
Damage to His Property
LOT FLOODED TEARS AGO
On arter of a Century of Liti
gation Follows Inunda
tion of North District
F^r the ninth time Michael Con
ias called a Jury to hearken to
his plaint against the city and coun
ty of San Francisco. Michael owns
a 19x60 foot lot on Houston street,
off Montgomery avenue near Jones
street. In* 1880, when the city laid
out Montgomery avenue, it changed
the natural drainage avenues of the
district and Conniff's lot was flooded.
He forthwith filed suit against the
and county and recovered Judg
ment for $4 50 damages. As the nuis
ance waÂ« not corrected in due time
iff filed a second suit against the
city, recovering $600 damages. It was
then that the city determined that it
â was high time something was done to
"onniff In his judgment recovering
career and it was determined to raise
the level of Conniff's lot to that of the
surrounding neighborhood.
The lot was declared a public
dumping ground and in their zeal to
aid the city the garbage men overdid
things and the lot soon reared itself
t*-n feet above the neighborhood.
Then ('onniff went to court again and
recovered a verdict for $141 damages.
The city protested that it had done its
duty by filling the lot. but Conniff de
nied the allegation, saying his prized
property had not been filled with soil,
as it should have been, but had been
made the last resting place of the re
mains of dogs, cats, bed springs, tin
cans and garbage that reared them-
Frlves, an unsanitary monument, ten
feet above the surrounding landscape.
So he sued again and recovered $275
damage*. The city went to the Su
preme Court with the case, but Con
riff recovered a judgment declaring
that the city had foisted a continuing
nuisance upon his property. Thus
encouraged Conniff again went to the
courts and recovered a fifth judgment
for $250 damages. Since that date
the suit has been tried three times
more and now the case Is up again
before Judge Kerrigan and a Jury for
tdjudication.
Assistant City Attorneys Partridge
and Smith are defending the case for
the city. They say the Board of
Work 6 has made borings on the prop
erty and found that in filling the lot
the city established a firm foundation,
through which no waters seep and
that it has done all it can do. Con
niff, however, wants the lot put in bet
ape. This is the ninth suit, but
vs there will be nineteen more
ss the city does the right thing,
and in his effort to make it he has al
ready cost it about $2000 in Judg
ments and costs. Just what view of
the question the present jury will
take nf the question remains" to be
but it is said that its action will
;y determine the sequel of the
long story of Conniff vs. the city and
county of San Francisco.

SPEtU OF STREET CARS.
Edward Troy filed a communication
in which he states that Kansas Ciiy
has an ordinance limiting the speed Â«f
street cars to twelve miles an hour.
Regarding the suggestion of Attorney
Tirey L. Ford that Los Angeles and
Minneapolis would be good examples
to follow in not limiting the speed of
street cars Troy says:
"The Coroner of Los Angeles writes
me that thirty-three persons died in
that city last year through street car
accidents, or at the rate of one in
every 3500 of the population. In San
Francisco the rate was, during 1903,
one in every 10,000 of our population.
In New York the rate was about one
in 70.000 of the population.
"Am to Minneapolis, I have no doubt
that Doc Ames, the former Mayor of
that city, before going to the peniten
tiary, delivered the streets to the rail
way corporations as completely as he
turned the town over to the criminals."
Quadt's Affidavit Ignored.
The suit brought by C. A. Bort to
recover $25,000 damages from John
Quadt for personal injuries sustained
through the breaking of a scaffold
upon which the plaintiff was working,
painting the Palace Hotel, as an em
ploye of the defendant, was placed
on trial before Judge Hunt and a jury
yesterday. Quadt filed an affidavit
for a continuance, saying he is ill
and unable to attend court. Bort tes
tified, however, that he had seen
Quadt out driving with a little girl.
The court then ordered the trial to
proceed. Bort alleges that the acci
dent, in which he was seriously in
jured, being hurled two stories to the
pavement, was caused by imperfect
appliances furnished the painters for
use by Quadt.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. MARCH 21. 1905
SEVEN FEET OF EBONY IN
PRISONERS' DOCK.
Negro Unfolds Like Giraffe
Arrested for Larceny, He Pleads That
Jail Beds Are Too Short
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
When the name of B. P. Hardlson
was called in Police Judge Mogan's
court, a huddled bundle of clothing
in a corner of the prisoners' cage "be
came animated and gradually unfolded
about seven feet of slim and ragged
negro. The uncoiling process was sug
gestive of a boa constrictor recovering
from coma, and when the full length
was perpendicular the head overtopped
the barred partition and an ebon face
prinned good-naturedly at the as
tounded magistrate. Then the elon-
gated Ethiopian wriggled sinuously
through the low door, straightened up
again and beamingly said:
"Heah ah is, sah."
He was accused of petty larceny, al
leged to have been committed in a
Pinckney-place "wine joint." It was
averred that he ordered "dago red"
for every one in the saloon and then
requested the barkeeper to charge the
price to him. When informed that no
books were kept in the establishment
he facetiously suggested that his ac
count be chalked on a piece of ice, and
when the man behind the counter dis
played wrath and threatened to sum
mon police aid the waggish debtor
stretched forth one of his tentacle-like
arms, openly abstracted $2 from the
cashbox and was preparing to depart
when his arrest was effected.
In reply to the Judge's inquiry Mr.
Hardiscfh said he resided in Oakland
and was a hodcarrier, his unusual stat
ure making him exceptionally desirable
as a conveyor of bricklayers' supplies,
inasmuch as it obviated necessity of his
climbing a ladder until after the sec
ond story was built. He must have
been intoxicated when he treated a
saloonful of strangers to wine and also
purloined the $2, because he was not
naturally of generous or extravagant
habit and had never been afflicted with
iarcenous tendency. # Yes, he had at
tained his full physical growth, and
hoped the Judge would take into con
sideration the fact that if he were sent
to jail he would be additionally pun
ished by his inability to stretch to com
plete length in an ordinary bed. His
Honor promised to make due allow
ance for nocturnal warning when he
pronounces sentence to-day.
Louis Heckler, a carpenter, applied
to Judge Mogan for three months' im
prisonment, explaining that he desired
to free himself from servitude to King
Alcohol.
"I'm a decent man, your Honor," he
said, "and have a little son to bring
up. Drink has obtained a grip on me
that I cannot shake off so long as I
am at liberty, and I think my only sal
vation is a term in jail. The boy will
be well taken care of while I am away
from him."
He was accommodated.

"I'm a hard-working man and drank

After the cigar store at 212 California
street had been burglariously entered
and looted seven times within three
months, James Jones, on parole from
the Whittier Reform School, was oap
tured with some of the stolen goods in
his possession. He had several boxes
of cigars under his arms when Sergeant

Sunday morning near the water front,

his arraignment before Judge Mogan,

tives saw to It that he made good his
word. Then the charge was dismissed.
Patrolman Goff, once noted as a
heavy-wfight br-xer, told Judge Con
lan that in all his prizering experience
he never had s harder tusslo than was
given him by Mrs. Mary Galvin and
Mr. and Mrs. Jeremiah Hurley when
he undertook to arrest them at their
residence, 34 Natoma street, on com
plaint of Mrs. SadJe Robinson, occupy
ing No. 30 on the same thoroughfare.
Only his knowledge of the fighting
game, he averred, saved him from a
defeat that would have been humiliat
ing, inasmuch as two-thirds of the op
posing force was feminine. Indeed,
three men would have been much
easier to subdue, because he could have
fought them indiscriminately, while he
could not either gallantly or humanely
have visited the full strength of his
prowesstlpon Mrs. Galvin or Mrs. Hur
ley. He finally won. and any impartial
witness of the combat would testify
that he did not treat the women with
more violence than was essential to
their subjugation.
There were witnessesâ a swarm of
themâ but their impartiality was ques
tionable, as each of them had been
summoned to testify in behalf of either
the complainant or the defendants.
About a dozen matrons were ready and
willing to swear that Mrs. Robinson's
alleged grievance was a figment of her
imagination, while as many other wives
and mothers were eager to swear that
Mrs. Galvin and Mr. and Mrs. Hurley
were neighborhood pests. But only the
testimony of Mrs. Robinson was heard,
and it was to the effect that her peace
was nightly routed by wild orgies in
the residence of the defendants." They
drank deeply of beer, Mrs. Robinson
declared, and while under the influence
of the beverage their conduct was sim
ply unendurable to sober persons.
The Judge pronounced Mr. Hurley
guilty of peace disturbance and resist
ing an officer, continued the case of
Mrs. Hurley and granted Mrs. Galnin's
request for a jury trial. So the twenty
four disappointed matrons may yet be
given opportunity to talk in court.

H. J. Haley's apartment in the lodg
ing-house at 737 Mission street was
divided from the chambers on each
side by seven-foot high wooden parti
tions, and when he decided to cele
brate the anniversary of St. Patrick's
birthday in seclusion he gave no heed
to what his next-door neighbors might
think of the celebration. His prear
ranged programme consisted of liquid
refreshments and vocal music, and with
bottle and glass in hand he reclined
upon his couch and sang songs appro
priate to the day. He rattled off "St.
Patrick's Day in the Mor-n-n-ning"
with rollicking gusto, and after toast
ing the subject of the ditty and him
self he warbled "St. Patrick Was a
Oentleman." Another double toast
was followed by "The Wearing of the
Green," which emptied the bottle. Then
he sallied forth to obtain another sup
ply of the inspiration.
One of the rooms adjoining that rent
ed by Mr. Haley was occupied by Fred
Hollen of Teutonic nativity, and he lay
upon his cot and quite enjoyed the en
tertainment that wafted over the par
tition. A sudden cessation of the sing-
ing: grieved him, and after a brief pe
riod of the painful silence he resolved
to ascertain its cause. That was how
he came to be in Mr. Haley's stall when
Mr. Haley returned with the replen
ished bottle, and that also was how he
fame to }y^ arraigned before Judge
Conlan on the charge of burglary.

The agitation relative to the preven

To prove the first, it is said that Japanese â¢

adaptability and desire to learn' the best that ,
we have to teach, â¢ in th.'lr freedom from crime ,
and their desire to faithfully obey -both in let- :

The Board of Supervisors yesterday'
finally passed the ordinance fixing thej
maximum amount to be charged for |
illuminating gas at $1 per 1000 cubic
feet.
Supervisor Gallagher favored a "5
1 cent rate, arguing that W. 500,000 would
be a fair valuation of the plant and
i that rate would net the company 8 per
cent on the investment. He held that
the item of $227,000 for interest on bond
ed indebtedness should be eliminated
and that the San Francisco Gas Com
pany's valuation of $14,000,000 placed on
its plant is excessive.
The ordinance fixes the price for
street gas lamps at 8.7 cents per night
and for clusters of three lights at 15
cents. The vote on final passage of the
ordinance follows:
Ayesâ Booth, Brandenstein, Braun
hait, Compte, Connor, D'Ancona, Eg- ,
gers. Hocks, Payot, r ckâ lo.
Noesâ Alpers, Bent, Boxton, Galla- !
gher, Lunstedt, McClellan, Rea, San
derson â 8.
The contract for doing orficial adver- ;
ti^ng for the city for one year was
awarded to the Post at 25 cents for ;
each one-half inch. The bid of the
Journal of Commereefat 8^ cents, was :
rejected because it did not file affida-
Vita of circulation and publication.

The ordinance ordering the construc
tion of a concrete sewer in Mission
street, between Onondaga and Amazon

tween Mission and London streets, at
a cost of $15,000, was finally passed.
The amended ordinance exempting
small assembly halls ror public enter
tainments from the prohibitory pro
visions of the theater ordinance was
finally passed. The amendment is de- I
signed to permit the Century Club to :
continue the construction of its build
ing at Sutter and Franklin streets,
which was stopped by the Board of
Works.
The ordinance dedicating Mission ;
blocks Nos. 86 and 87 to park purposes '
and naming the same "Mission Park" i

ing the appointment of three civil serv
: ice clerks for the Auditor's office, to

finally passed.
The Chinese Hospital, a corporation,
I was granted a permit to conduct a san- '
| itarium at 810-812 Jackson street for ,
i the treatment of Chinese patients by |
white practitioners. The Institution is !
a charitable one and is indorsed by the
I medical department c/f the University
! of California.
The board adopted a resolution as

YOUNG WAITER BRUTALLY
BEATEN BY THR* JE MEN
Struck Behind Right Ear and Ren
dered Unconscious for Two Hours
Besides Being Kicked.
Albert O'Brien, a waiter in a restau
rant at 539 Sixth street, was attacked
by three men on Sunday morning. He
received a blow behind the right ear
that left him in a state of unconscious
ness for two hours. He was also kick
ed in the ribs. He is confined to bed.
but as soon as he is able to leave the
house he will swear out warrants for
the- arrest of his assailants.
About 8 o'clock O'Brien went to a
saloon across the streer from the
restaurant to buy ten cents' worth of
whisky for another waiter. The three
men were standing in the doorway of
Strock & Lueey's saloon, 531 Sixth
street. When he returned to the
restaurant they followed him and com
menced to call him offensive names.
He told them he did not want to have
any trouble and one of them struck
him the blow behind the right ear.
While O'Brien lay unconscious on
the floor his assailants kicked him in
the ribs. When they recognized that
he was unconscious they carried him
into Strock & Lucey's saloon and tried
to ref-ive him by pouring whisky down
his throat. Jhen they rang for the
ambulance aid had him taken to the
Central Emergency Hospital.
Detective Ryan, who is working on
the case, says that one of O'Brien's as
sailant was a brother of Saloon-keeper
Lucey, and that the only reason tor
the assault was that O'Brien did not
buy the whisky at Strock & Lucey's
place.

John Brady, alias "Cocky" Braiy.
(was shipped to sea yesterday on a ves
sel bound for the seal fisheries in P
beria. He pleaded guilty in Judge
Lawlor's court abont two weeks ago
to a charge of burglary, after Thomas
Sbarboro, who was arrested on thÂ«
same charge, had been acquitted by a
Jury. Brady's father and mothÂ»r
begged the Judge to allow him to go r>iÂ«
probation, declaring that he was i
boy. but when under the influence of
liquor he became crazy and did not
know what he was doing. The Judge
consented on condition that he go away
on a deep water vessel. The pv I
gave a bond of $1000 and it was ar
ranged that Brady wouM leave on V
vessel for Siberia that sailed yesterday.
The action of the Judge has caused a
good deal of comment in the District
Attorney's office and in the Police De
partment in view ol Brady's past his
tory. Since 1SÂ»*Â» he has served thrÂ»Â«
terms in the Crmnty Jail for petty lar
ceny and two terms in San Quentin f<>r

breaking into the butcher shop of A.

night of December 18 last he fought
Policemen Lloyd and Ste'.zner. the ar
resting officers, and attempted to brain
them. For these reasons the acti
the- Judge in allowing Brady to go on
probation is not looked upon with
favor.
