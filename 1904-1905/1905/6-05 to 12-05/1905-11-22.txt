INSURANCE MONEY SWELLS
NEW YORK CAMPAIGN FUND
United States Senator Thomas
C Plait of New York testified
at the insurance investigation
yesterday that he had received
from three insurance companies
many $ 1 0,000 contributions to
the Republican State campaign
fund. It was shown by another
witness that for years \V. S.
Manning of Albany has been
on the payrolls of the large
companies, presumably because
he possessed secret knowledge
as to their business methods.
Senator Platt Tells
of Frequent Con
tributions.
SUMS OF $10,000 /'

Mysterious Friend of
Depew Brought
to Light.
MANNING PAID
TO KEEP QUIET
NEW YORK, Xov. 21. â The identity
of Senator Depew's "cantankerous
friend from up the river" was disclosed
â¢ in the session of the State Legislative
Insurance Investigating Committee to
day by the testimony of John A.,Nich
ols, a law;, Â«Â±r under retainer by the
Eauitable ..ire Assurance . Society.
.Nichols Jiad wj-itten to Senator Depew
a letter rerc rrhig 10 a person in the
above" t&rnis^'ana this letter was .* read
" Â«.t UÂ»e session" tTT the*cotsSiltie*e""oh i "T i f m
day, when Senator Depcw was on the
stand. The \u25a0Senator was ": unable to re
call who was meant by the ."cantanker
ous friend," " but to-day '.Nichols dis
doÃed a series of payments -to- W. S.
Manning of Albany, a former actuary,
\u25a0vvho hatl been connected with, the in
vestigation of insurance companies in
ihTT. - Â«
Hughes inquired as to a report that
Manning had been ia* possession 'of. In
formation that was suppressed during
this investigation and that would have
bceu detrimental to .the Equitable.
"Nichols could not recall the suppression
of information, but he detailed the
payment of sums of money over a con
siderable period to Manning as an in
dut-ement to give up his business as
actuary, in which capacity he believed
Mauning was a menace to the Equitable
Company. ~ , ;V; : "
PLAIT HANDLED TUB -SACK."
Aside from the disclosures made by
Nichols on the witness stand, the fea
ture of the day was the appearance of
Uuitcd States .Senator Thomas C Platt,
â¢who did not hfs'Uite to tell of the con
tributions of insurance companies to
titate campaigns. The Equitable, the
Mutual anil the New York Life were the
only insurant*; companies that -made
fcucu contributions. Tlje Equitable con
tributed rcguarlj-.JIO.OOCr to State cam
paigns, the Mutual Life the same sum
frequently and the New York Life a j
turn jiot as large, and only occasionally, j
1 hese 'moneys were always delivered iii \
cash to tionator Platt's ' oftice by mes- !
seng-er and be turned them over to the |
t*t;:iÂ«, committee;. ''I'*%' \
The l?f;italo:- said he was expected
to influence the Legislature when any
legislation appeared tliat was hostile to
the insurance companies. Senator Platt
e&id he believed be had asked Presi
dent R. A. McCurdy of the Mutual Life
for a contribution when the needs were
very great.. He, however, had never
been asked to use his Influence on any '
measure before the - Legislature, nor ;
had he ever done so.. He knew noth
ing, about contributions to the national
campaign.
TAHUEL.L CAUSKS AMUSEME*rr\.
<Jage Â£*. Tarbell, the eecond vice pres
ident of the Equitable, was on the wit
ness stand again to-day. His testimony
ou Friday "was Interrupted by the ad
journment and to-day he continued his
explanation of the agency 'system, of
.which he bad charge, and the manner -
of arriving nt the commissiontt. - One
part of his testimony caused much
amusement to the committee, . as well
as to the spectators, when he described
a fight with the New York I^fe over,
the taking. of agents. In this state-;:
ment Tarbell told how he ha<~ won over
ft general agent and. 2oo sub-agents of
the New York Life In this city without
the cost to, the Equitable of, so much'
as one dollar. The only Inducement j
offered was thatthe ajrcntK could make j
more on acommission basis than'undcr
the salary- system of the New -York i
L'fe,' < ~aBH y^JflffiyffraPff .-
Tafbell detailed this deal with the
'agents in Its various stage?,; and Â«ald ,
that he closed the deal on^ a Sunday. ,
He thougfat It was a good Job, as it ]
was done on a good day. .' '. j \

That the Proposals of the j

. WASHINGTON, Nov. 21. â Divergent I
views developed at a conference of the |
Republican members t>f the Senate
Committee on Interstate Commerce, j
The conference followed a regular ;
meeting of the committee in the aft- ;
ernoon and was attended by six of the j
eight Republican members. Senators
Clapp and Millard were not present,
' Of- the six members attending the \u25a0
conference it developed that Senators'
Klklns. Alch-ich, KeaÂ« and Feraker
were nearly in accord on one side and
Senators Culloin and Doiliver were on
the \u25a0' other. No propositions were ad- j
vanced, but the four Senators in the !
Ilrst group mentioned indicated their
desire for harmonious action and not
too radical legislation. Senators Cul- ,
loin and Doiliver insisted that the only
way to have harmonious Republican
action was for all the Republican* to j
get In line with the President and sup
port iiis recommendations. The other
i>onaUÂ»rs suggested that the proposi
tion of the- 'President had not crystal
lised.sufficiently to determine just what
he ivanled..
1 'No measure was presented by any of
the Senators embodying their views,
although it Is known that several
measures have been drafted. After tho
.conference adjourned some members
of tho committee expressed the opin
ion that a bill would be agrefd on. but
tli+- ' opinion was also expressed that
the majority of the full committee
would report in accordance witn the

other line Trill branclv orf th.c main

being constructed fromvChamberlln, S.

The Pacific lluilroad, running' from

the State of Washington on. October 13
of tills j oar, .with an "authorized cap

projected for a distance of 250 miles.
Iho pnt-Pident is H. R. t VVilliams, who
until recently was greneral manager of

Nerve
Everything depends upon "
your nerves. It is nerve force
that causes the brain to direct
the motion of your body; it is
nerve force that causes *your
heart to pulsate, and send the
blood through your veins; it
is nece force that causes your
stomach to digest food, your %
kidneys to filter the blood, and
the liver to secrete bile.
In fact, nerve force is the
power that runs your body, so
if you feel worn-out, .irritable,
nervous, cannot sleep, or eat ;
well, have pain or misery
anywhere, your nerves ,are
weak, and your system run-
down. 1 To restore this vitality - %
take Dr. Miles' Nervine which
will strengthen and build up
the nerves. You cannot be
healthy without strong nerves.
"For eighteen yws~ Dr. M'les"
Nervine and Anti-Pain Pills have been-

.ART OF GRAFTING
THEME OF LECTURE
Illinois State Senator Tells
of Dish onest Practices
: of Legislators.
CHICAGO, Xov. 21. â State Senator
Francis W. Parker lectured on "Graft
in l>Â£rislntive P.odies' last night before
the Men's Club of the Hyde Park Bap
tist Church. He said:
One of- the familiar devices of the modern
rrafting Legislature, working In the Interest
of and directly or Indirectly In the pay of
those who have an Interest adverse to the
public, is to- manipulate the "business so that
it wfl! be concentrated, in' the final days of
the session and everything: will be killed..
Another famllier pretext is to load the bill
the â¢jat^ase of which '\u25a0> has become - inevitable
with conditions and incidents fatal to its effi
ciency, or which prolong the Deriod of its I ap
plicability." until after the next session of the
I-rf-gislature,- when It again may become sub
ject mattiÂ»F for discussion.
The sraft of the future is Just this kind of
negativfl. graft.'' The exeat "interest* adverse
to the -people are no longer demanding legis
lation. They have their lands, their cnarters,
their franchises, their well-nigh uncontrolled
possession \u25a0of the regulation . of the rates I for
the xervicps ! which they render. They are
asking nothing except to be let alone.
The result is that we have legislative as
sembliesâcity. State and nationalâ with men
who in ancient times would have poisoned
we!!s or defiled temples engaged ostensibly in
passing laws for the communities, which . they
represent. . \u25a0
The' craft of the legislator Is secret. No
books are kept which some day are certain- to
reveal his , crime. â¢ No . partner is In a poel
tlon to reveal the .wrong. If some one loses
money to him In a poker game or retains his
law i-artner at a time when critical legisla
tion Is before him, no one can trace the crime
to him, even though , all the facts become
known.

ZEMSTVOISTS TO AID
COUNT DE WITTE
Russian Premier Now Assured
of Powerful Support
Reforms in the Universities
MOSCOW. Nov. 2L-The sentiment of
the Zemstvo Congress is veering: distinct
ly to the side of Count de W'itte and it
now seems probable that a large majority
of the delegates will favor a resolution
to come to the assistance of the Govern-:
ment against the forces of revolution and
disorganization, though only because,
such action is regarded by a considerable
faction as the least of many evils.
Such leaders as M. St. Chepkone of
Moscow, Alexander Stakovich, Michael
Stakovlch, Prince Paul Dolgorukoff and
Prince Volkonsky of Riazan, who are
among the prominent men in Russia and
who have the confidence of those en
gaged in the reform movement, came out
boldly at to-day's session and laid down
as a plain truth that only through co-_
operation with the Government, good or
Uad though it be, lay the way to a happy
realization of the liberties promised by
the imperial manifesto of October. 30.
The EDeech of Prince Paul Dolgorukoff
was one of the best delivered since the
opening of the Congress. Arguing in de
fensa of a resolution to the effect that
the Cabinet of Count de Witte could
count on the support of many classes of
Russian society while putting into opera
tion the liberties of a constitution biased
on the Emjjeror's manifesto of October
30. he warned the Congress against the
present state of revolutionary hysteria
and declared that at this time, when im r
portant creative work was In progress,
it would be wrong to demand the imme
diate removal of every timber of the
foundation of the Russian Government,
even though many of the planks were ad
mittedly rotten. The Ministry of Count
de Witte, which he compared to a com
mission in the -bankruptcy court, was far
from ideal, but he said it must be sup
ported and sustained.
The Prince brought the Congress to its
feet by declaring that, no matter who
might be at the head of the Government,
the regime of the autocracy and the
bureaucracy had now been relegated to
the limbo of "idiotic fantasies."
The admission of women to the uni
versities on the same conditions govern
ing the admission of men Is declared by
Count Josn Tolstoi, the new Minister of
Education, in an interview published this
morning, to be part of his policy. The
Minister is also in favor of instituting
reforms in the universities and the higher
schools, which he declares are in "an
abominable state."
MAY GItAVT UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE.
De Witte** Cabinet DlÂ«poÂ»ed to Make
Anotbrr Sweeping Concession.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 2Lâ The news
papers of this city appeared to-day for
the first time in more than a week.
There is a significant change of tone on
the part cf some of the Radical organs
against the dictatorial attitude of the
Social Democrats.
The Russ loudly denies that the vic
tory of the imperial reform manifesto
belongs solely to the workmen, declaring
that the proletariat was strong then be
cause it voiced the sentiment of the na
tion.
"The leaders of the proletariat," says
the Russ, "must understand that they
cannot and must not become dictatorial.
The precious strength of the nation, ex
hausted by a long struggle, must not be
wasted."
The Cabinet has drafted a series of
measures to protect the rights of In-.
c*;viduals against the coercion and
tyranny of the labor leaders which. In the
event of another strike, will be placed
In operation during the interim until the
National Assembly meets.
The Minister of Justice, M. Manukhin,
has drafted a habeas corpus law for sub
mission to the Cabinet.
The Immediate question confronting the
Cabinet Is the electoral law. Premier de
Witte and his colleagues ' have almost
reached the conclusion to base the elec
tions practically on universal suffrage.
An afternoon paper Quotes a man who
has jost arrived In St. Petersburg as
saying that 10,000 Don Cossacks are
marching from Tashkend to St. Peters
burg with the object of releasing the
Emperor, whom they believe to be a cap
tive In the hands of the Jews.

goes.:, Miss Rockwell was a Portia with
out a plea.- The casting of Fuller. Mellish,
the' excellent. /King; Philip of "Don

upon- that gentleman's most unmirthful
head. Bassanio is a: gentlemanly.^ person,*

Shylock, though he gets an illuminat

portrait. .'.Older,' rather, 'than" most
other ; of Shylocks, this seems/ perhaps
by a year 'or- two' too .old to have the

Jew's deadly; plot. There is a little too

unions would \u25a0 control all work in the lines o t

theirs was "a different line of work. Now.

CORNERS ARE WORN
FROM HIS HEAD.
Herman Nelson Loses
on Rectangular Graniiim.
SWEDE MASTERS THE /PHONE
Herman Nelson .when he was cast
ashore at Castle Garden had four cor
ners on his .head. He brought the
aforesaid corners to California, but
when he appeared before Judge Mo
gan yesterday he was without corners
and almost without head. He had,' his
first tussle with a telephone yesterday.
On the way over on the emigrant
ship they were prepared for Nelson.
They saw him coming. There was a
square porthole, through which Nelson
could gaze upon the briny. They told
him on the ship that it was the same
porthole through which Battling Nel
son's ancestry gazed. In the land of
the free they assured Herman that all
the windows were constructed so that
his cranial angles would not* interfere
with his gazing out into the streets
end watching the throng get busy.
This was an agreeable surprise to
Herman. Back in his own country the
old crowds had declared that In
America windows were constructed in
a circumferential fashion. The heads
of the people were so built that they
could stick/ them through these round
apertures and look out upon the uni
verse.
Herman soon discovered that the vil
lage storytellers had been handing
him "the bunk," as the police say when
they are not making an exhibition talk.
The fir6t corner disappeared from Her
man's head Immediately' after the elec
tion. I His head was so typical of the
slogan, a "square â¢ deal," that gentry
who were opposed to that condition of
affairs removed a" corner. A second
angle of the oranium was readjusted
by a runaway hack.
Another corner disappeared in the
wash.. Herman had been overpaying
a designing; Chinaman and/the Asiatic
had been paying with' the grand flim
flam. To prove the Celestial's perfidy
Herman disguised himself "as the laun
dry. They ironed the "third, corner
from his head and but one remained.
That last protuberance on the cran
ium of Herman wore . off in the bout
he had with Judge Mogan's telephone.
Nelson was before his Honor on a
charge of . wandering -through a win
dow at 639 Pacific street The. same
pane of glass bore the unmistakable
earmarks of- having been butted with
the one-cornered head.
"Tudge," ' said Herman, "Ay bay good
ef you let me go."
"If you can get some one to go on
your bond for $25 I will give you a
chance," said Judge Mogan.
"Ay tank Ay know a fallar." said
Herman. %
"Telephone and see ,if he will ' come
to the rescue," suggested his Honor.
"Ay navar â¢ ban to talaphone. I tank
I go to yall." said Herman despond
ently.
"Nonsense," said Judge Mogan. "Of
ficer Lycette . will ; ring up your friend
for you and you can tell him what you
want" - 4
Lycette finally Mister 'Ton
eon" on an outside phone and thrust
' Herman into the booth.
/\u25a0 "Ban dls you, Yohnle?" asked Mr.
Nelson. "Ay : ban In yall, Yohnle. Ay
tank you ban yoshing. Ay don't tank
you ban Yohnle;. but If you ban Yohnie,
yumping ylmminy come quick with $25
and Ay bay good."
With this ; plea Herman dropped the
receiver and -fled. To his complete sur
prise Yohnle materialized In half an
hour with the $26 .and' he was freed.
;Tumplng;'yimmny,". . gasped Nelson
as* he scratched his head." - The '" last
corner on his cranium had disap
peared. \u25a0"\u25a0 ; ..

been .for weeks' plying, their nefarious

When the convention assembled this

the part of the Tanana 'delegates, sup
ported by the delegation from* South

three delegates named, as after, caucus
ing: a great or part of ;the night it was
seen that It would be impossible Ito

the ball by 'declaring 'that; as some of
the del egations were divided " each . f ac- .
tion ought to be allowed to bring, in Its

RUNAWAY WIFE

William N. Benedict Obtains
a Final Decree of Divorce
From His Faithless Spouse
ELOPED WITH MINISTER
Sensational Flight of the
Key. Charles Waylffidj Hoag
From Oakland Is Kecalled
OAKLAND," Nov. 21. â The sequel to
au elopement which not only wrecked
tlie happiness of two homes, but also
caused the jflissolutlori of the Plymouth
avtnue \u25a0 Cor.srcfriitlonnl Church, came
this afternoon, when William N. Bene
dict was granted a final decree of di
\ci'oÂ« from ilre. Hinda C. Benedict.
About. Â«". vrar agn his wife left him
and ran a.\v,ay with the Key. Charles
V.'ayland Jloag. who at the time of his
witb Mrs. Benedict was pas-
Mr cf the Plymouth-avenue' Chiireh.
vjiicJi hsa since ror.polidated witli Oak
Chapel. Church. The faithless wife was
a member of tiie church choir', -and for
Â£Â«?vtral weeks before the elopement the
\u25a0 iosÂ« friendship between the minister
.-.mUthe member of his flock had. caused
gossip among the members of Hie con
gregation.
No 'one, however, suspected the ex
tent of the pasture attachment for Mrs.
Benedict, and great was the scandal in
the church when It was learn<Â»d that
the pastor had left the city, deserting
bis wile and child, an<i that Mrs. Bene
dict was also missing. A few 6";iys aft
erward the trustees of the church re
ceived a. letter from the erring: clergy
man, in which he expressed contrition
lor his sin, but did not confess outright
that he hud eloped with Airs. Benedict,
Some weeks later Hoajr suddenly re
turned to Oakland and hi? then denied
that he had left the city with Mis. Bon
edict or knew anything of her wherea
bouts. He resigned from the pulpit of
the church and announced his deter
mination of entering- upon the practice
of law. LÂ«ter he entered the employ of
fc local firm of attorneys. In explana
tion of his sudden flight from the city
Hoag declared that his mind had been
effected by hard study and that he did
not at the time fully know what he was
doing.
~*Beneciet, however, hau placed detec
tives on the trail of his wife, and by
this means he discovered hat the pair
bÂ«d been seen together at several
points and had gone to Arizona. He at
once began ?uit for divorce anil ha.d no
difficulty in gettiiga decree, which was
made firffcj to-day.

VOYAGES TO FAR CATHAY
FOR HIS HELPMEET.
Yop tee to Wed in the Land of His Eattiers
1 OAKLAND. Nov. 21.â Strange Is the
quest of young: Yop Tee, a comely China
man, for the bride in far-away Cathay
whom he fca3 never seen.
To meet the dying request of his aged
father, and to fulfill a pledge the parent
made many- years ag-o in the Orient, the
sleek and youthful bridegroom has sailed
away across the Pacific to claim as wife
the pretty. little Oriental who was sealed
to him by the oaths of the parents.
Strange story, abounding in a remark
able mixture of the East with the Occi
dent, is the romance of young Yop Yee
of Hay-wards. It ramifies through two
continents and carries- a tale of wealth,
of a marrlace of Chinese and Caucasian,
of travel and gold, with a little Oriental
cupld as the centerpiece.
Chofig Yot Yee, father of the young
i man, left his .native land years ago. He
came to America and rapidly accumu
lated gold, his . business acumen being
sharpened by contact with the bustling
Westerner. The father marie a hand
some pile in Montana and went to Chi
cago. There he persuaded one Martha
Jane Bryant, a buxom American, to be
come his wife. Happily the pair dwelt
together. She. was a faithful wife and
Chong uiwed to be n dutiful husband.
As fruit of the marriage six children
were born, the eldest being Yop Yee. Sev
eral year* ago the family returned to
San Francisco, where the father had
landed so many moons before, and a j-ear
ago they settled at Haywards. Still of
business inclinations the Yees opened a

large laundry. Not long afterward
trouble came upon them. The authorities
decided that the eldest daughter, Laura
Yee as she was known, must be taken
from her parents and despite efforts in
resistance the girl was removed.
Several weeks afterward Chong waÂ«
gathered to his ancestors. The Ameri
can widow and her children at his death
bed learned of the sacred promise he had
made that his first-born should wed the
daughter of fils neighbors in a little vil
lage near Canton whence he came.
True to her Chinese husband's memory
and embued with the solemn import of
his ant. the wife joined with her son In
the decision that he should set sail for
the land of his father and gain the help
mate who had been set aside for him. '
That is why Top Yee was a passenger
on the steamship Mongolia when the liner
Bailed last week for the Orient With
him as companion was his sister, Martha)
a comely young woman, who will take
part in the ceremonies that shall soon
make good the oledge of the dead father
and his deathbed . wish. ; J-v'rC:: -
In the parting with her son, the mother
lost him forever, for he will spend the
remainder of his life in a home with his
bride near the scene of his father's early
years, and with them will dwell little
Martha. Perhaps, among the eligible
youth of the village some desirable catch
will ba made, for Martha, as beauty is
rated from a Chinese point of view, would
not be below dot. Too Yee carried with
him on his romantic journey a goodly
bag of gold, hia Inheritance as the first
born of a peculiar union. The widow and
mother will remain at Haywaf ds with
the remnant of her family. .

DIAMONDS
ARE STOLEN
BY JEWELER
Francis T. Sargent, a Jeweler from
Point Richmond, was arrested yesterday
afternoon by Detectives Ryan and ODea
and will be charged with the theft of
nearly $10,000 worth of diamonds ana
stock from city stores. In the posses
eion' of the property clerk of the Police
Department diamonds valued at $7000
tave already been placed. Sargent, who
confesses hit guilt, will accompany the
detectives to his place of business g this
morning and about S3OOO worth of loot
will bo recovered and returned ' to its
owners. The Pinkertons and Constable
Moitoza cf Point Richmond have worked
on the case. ' _
A package of the gems was recovered
by the police, Sargent disclosing the hid
ing place in a bathtub In Spierssch
Brothers' plumbing shop. Two months
apo Mrs. Sargent gave the package to
Mrs. Richard Spierssch, with whom she
had been very friendly, requesting the
plumber's wife to keeo it until Mrs. Sar
gent ehoulfl call for It. To-day for the
first time It was demanded. . Mrs.
Bplerssch said she had no Idea what the
parcel contained. She had "put it in the
bathtub in the shop as an out-of-the-way
place where It would not be disturbed.
The police have no suspicion whatever
of Mrs. Bplerssch, believing that the
circumstance. so. far as she is concerned
was merely a friendly act.
Pangs of conscience led to the capture
of the culprit Sargept was about to re
turn what he had stolen and to ask for
giveness of those he had robbed, when the
detectives placed their hands on his
Ehoulders and claimed -him as their pris
oner. His method of Â»perating was of
the sneak-thief order and he cached his
epolls In various places. Including a
plumber's shop and a blacksmith's shop.
It was in the -former, pia^e that the dia
monds were found yesterday- The bal
ance of the stolen property will be found
in various places and the thief promises
to Â«how the detectives to-day where they
may recover all. of his pllferings, no por
tion of * which, he says, has been dis
posed of. "jJ*S3b
nOBBEKIES NUMEROUS.
Sargent has robbed many places in this
cltv Among them are A- Eisenberg &
Go".' Jacobl & Co., Kohler & Chase. Ben
jamin Curtaz, Sherman, ; Clay & Co. and
Chinese Jade Rings Luckstone
The. historical gem worn only by the an-
cient kings and princes of China, set in
pure ' Th c prettiest and* most - popu-
lar fad in jewelry.
Baldwin Jewelry Co.
James* Flood Bldg. 978 Market; Stree \u25a0'
Reynolds & Co.. and he Is suspected of
having been responsible for several other
crimes including a robbery in: the Palace
Hoteland the theft of several thousand
dollars', worth of Jewels from a Post
street :firm last September. ...The pris
oner has made a confession, which ,he
says is complete, and he denies that he
was implicated in any of. the latter
'thefts. s '.-,: ._\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-. ' ' . .'-\u25a0 /. - ">-JÂ°>j',
The thief has had a good reputation
and was well known by the members of
the firms with, which he traded. When
ever he visited the city and asked to ex
amine goods he was given access to ware
rooms and was never watched." It 'was
on these^occasions that Sargent commit
ted the thefts. When a clerk's back was
turned he would steal something of value
end in no Instance had the loss been dis
covered until after he had left the prem
ises. While in -the store of Eisenberg at
126 Kearny street, he pocketed, four
packages of diamonds and their . value
was ?7000. This loot was found In Rich
ard Spear's plumbing shop at Point Rich
mond. Jacobl & Co. say that they have
missed about SlOOO worth of stuff ana
they hold Sargent responsible. The j mu
sic houses have lost valuable * instru
ments, but Sargent says he will return
all of them to-day.
WAS ABOUT TO CONFESS.;
During yesterday . morning Sargent
met Eisenberg and told him that; he
had something to say to him. Eisen
berg was suspicious and telephoned to
the Central ' police station, from which
place the detectives were detailed^ Ac
cording to Sargent it " was his intention
to make a clean breast of the entire
affair and to return the stolen property
on a promise of immunity from pun
ishment. The thief's conscience
troubled him. He has a wife and two
children. - Why: he stole he does not
know, and the thought' of possible:de
tection kept- him worried, during
waking hours and he could not sleep at
-night. While he! was on his way ; . to
keep his appointment ' and make ; his
confession the minions of thelaw over
took him and he was sent to prison.
Sargent lies in a cell, an object of
dejection. He frequently , asks for, a
weapon that he may end his - life,", and
he cays that his mental agony > Is more
than can be imagined. : He is frank In
admitting hia guilt, and says he Â«: only,
cares for the consequences, so far, as
they affect his wife and children." The
police have many charges against him,'
some of which he denies, others he con
fesses. He. promises to restore^ every
thing he has taken and will accompany,
the detectives to; Point Richmond; this
morning, for the purpose of handing
into their possession the balance of the
stolen goods/ \ . * â¢ >

SOLDIERS' HEALTH AND THE; CANTEEN:
â¢v tt z iII LE ainiy officers arc not all in " agrccmciit upon the qucsr
\/\/ tion, it is evident that those who make air unbiased study/of.
V V the habits and health of the enlisted men do agree that both
arc improved by the post canteen. The life of soldiers on post is
monotonous. They crave recreation and amusement. . If reasonable
satisfaction of the'eraving is not furnished in the post no power on
earth can prevent them seeking unreasonable satisfaction outside.
The proof of this is visible in the low class saloons and deadfalls that
fringe every post. The keepers of these know the^ tendencies that,
guide the soldiers to their net. They make no mistake in seeking
profit 'out of the moral and physical degeneracy they cause. The
soldier's pay goes into their till, and their 'health-destroying stufr
goes into his stomach, to break down his manhood, destroy his moral
liber and make him the victim of further wiles and the subject of per
manent physical injury, unfitting him for the duties of military life
ond returning him marred and broken to civil life when his enlist
ment expires.
If proper use were made of the opportunity to inculcate disci
pline, regular hours and regularity of life in the army, it would be a
school of self-denial and formative of fine character, from which men
would graduate into private life, better men morally and physically
than when they enlisted. But this can he done only by guiding human
nature and not by squarely blocking it. When the canteen was in
operation, it was. in a definite sense, the enlisted man's club and
school. Its profits supported a library and reading-room to which
the men gladly resorted, seeking amusement ami study by reading
and recreation in playing the harmless games which satisfied their
craving for the excitement of chance and luck.
Even the strongest prohibitionists have admitted that -they do
rot succeed in keeping men out of saloons by crying "thou shalt
not."' The only way to do this is by competing with the saloon
through a substitute for its social features. To .the enlisted man in
the army that substitute was the canteen, his post club. There he
couM buy. at a reasonable and proper price, light wines and beer
only, in the way of alcoholic beverages, with ''soft"' drinks if he
chose, and such variations of his army ration as he wauted. There
he enjoyed the social side of life and had the opportunity -to improve <
ins mind and increase his information in the library and reading
room. All this tended to his improvement as a man and a citizen.
That beer and wine do not cause degeneracy seems to be certified by
ihe vast superiority of the beer and wine drinking Germans and
3-Yenchmcn over the vodka soaked Russians of the same class.
The objection made to the canteen by the prohibitionists is that
rt is official recognition by the Government of beer and wine, which
they classify with all other alcoholic drinks as "rum." They declare
ihat by doing this the Government runs a drunkard factory in the
sunny posts and that the drink habit is acquired by the use of these
light drinks. All that is a hypothesis.! No proof of it is submitted.
As a matter of fact it is observed by those who choose to be guided
by facts that wherever bqer and wine are introduced as beverages
ihc use of strong liquors decreases. The evidence is lacking that men
have acquired a thirst for whisky by drinking beer and wine.
It must be obvious to the prohibitionists that abolition of the
canteen has not removed temptation from the enlisted men. On the
contrary, temptation has been increased. Humanly seeking social ;
satisfaction, they find it only in'thc deadfalls that immediately moved
lip to every army post when the canteen was abolished. There they
are in immediate contact with every vice that demoralizes and ruins
men. There is no middle ground. It is either that or the post can-
We have endeavored to treat the subject judicially. It is up for
discussion. The reports of armj r officers consider it and recommend
the. restoration of the canteen. To this the prohibitionists answer
that these officers are themselves drinking men, who desire willfully
to lure the enlisted men into the same habits. This is sheer non
sense. The trained army officer feels that he is the guardian of his
men. If he enter battle with them his laurels depend upon their phy
sical condition and their loyalty and discipline. His sole interest is
in their moral and physical strength, their discipline and intelligence.
But the foes of the canteen would have us believe that the country's
safety in war rests upon drunken officers and drunken men.' It is a
calumny and libel.
AN INSURANCE ROAST.
INSURANCE companies are just now getting such a shakeup that
it is natural for them to play the return game, put cities on the
spit and roast them through. The national board of Fire Under
writers has been making a survey of Pacific Coast cities in regard
to their means of protection from fire.
Tlie report is generally uncomplimentary to "us all. San Fran
cisco got a scorching, and now the fire chief- of Oakland is put on
the carpet and gives tart reply to the underwriters. If all that the
national board say. were all that is to be said, it is a wonder that our
cities do not burn to the ground immediately.
For a long time the people in the East have had exaggerated
ideas of the unsafety of Western towns. One time when Joaquin
Miller was in Chicago he was interviewed for one of the newspapers.
He is a friend of the West and can be always relied upon for the
good word and timely. While he was telling the interviewer of the
progress of things Western the reporter interrupted him with, an
inquiry about the numerous city conflagrations out here. The poet
of thc r Sierras instantly replied, "Our fires are caused by the friction
of rapid growth."
If the national underwriters had gone a little deeper into the
subject they would have found that our immunity from general con
flagrations like the catastrophes in Chicago and Baltimore is due to
climatic differences. We need less fire, in our houses. Wherean
Eastern residence is run as red hot. as a blast furnace, requiring the
greatest precaution to keep chimneys up to the strain of expansion
and contraction, here we need only a handful of fire in an open
gTate, with no pressure on the draft and no strain on the chimney.
Here, too, we use redwood for the skin of all buildings .that, are not
brick or stone. It is non-resinous and contains an acid that is re
leased in a fire and extinguishes it with very little water.
We by no means decry precautions against fire. None should
be omitted. But it is a mistake to assume that conditions are the
same as in the East, for they are more favorable to safety from con
flagrations.. The great fires that formerly 'swept this city were fed
by the pitchy lumber that ;was' used in building. That was before
the redwood era: Since, it came such general and destructive con
flagrations* are impossible. ' _ â¢

HOW TO BE CHEERFUL

IN a recent article I advised persons
who found themselves feeling cross and
unsociable in the mqrnlng to refrain
from conversation until thoroughly ad
justed to the waking world. I stated it'
to be my opinion that this inharmonious
mental state does not necessarily indi
cate a disagreeable disposition, but rather
denotes the difficulty experienced by such
persons in \u25a0 regaining control of the vol
untary mind, held sq long .under the in-,
fluence of sleep. , .

"A friend sug^ested that possibly tea
and coffee were to blame, and I decided
to give them up, and In casting- about for
a hot table beverage, which I felt was
an absolute necessity, I was. led by good
fortune to try Postum Food Coffee, -For
more than 'a year I -have used it 'three

stead of toseine on a sleepless bed
through the long, dreary night, I dropped
Into a sound, dreamless sleep the moment
my head touched the pillow. Then I sud-
denly realized that all my nervousness
had left me, and my appetite, which had j
fallen off before, had all at once been
restored bo that I ate my. food with a

WRIHGHT LOSES
TENNIS MATCH
â \u2666
American Champion and J. S.
Tobin Defeated by Grant
.Smith a nd Percy 3lu rdock
THI^ COUIIT IS PUZZLING
Asphalt Surface Is Faster
Than the Turf Upon .Which
Be Plays, in the East
Beals C. Wright, the national tennis
champion, made his 'first appearance
yesterday on .the tennis -courts. in .this
city. Several hundred spectators were
attracted to the California Club by the
champion. \u25a0' The contestants were
Wright and Joseph S. Tobin on one
side of the net and Percy Murdock and
Grant Smith on the other.!"; Tho latter
won two sets out of three. *"*T<he i score
was 4â6.4 â 6. Tâs,T â 5, oâ4.0 â 4. -\u25a0y
While the match was an . interesting:
one, It fell considerably short of the
one played by the same leams'Â«t Bur
liugamc on Sunday. Wright had not
played on an asphalt court since he
was out here six years ago, and his
same suffered in consequence. The balls
bounce much higher than in, the grass
courts, and the champion consequently
hud to change his stroke some. His
overhead tvu*k was not as good as on"
Sunday. Tobin did not support the
champion as well as he did at Burlin
grame.
Murdock and Smith played spasmod
ically. They were grood ' and bad by
turns.. In the last set they put up a
fast same and did rood work at the
net. Wright put more twist and speed
into his play than was apparent to the
spectators. Much of the short lobbing
done by Murdock and Smith was due
in a measure to the peculiar left
handed twist the champion put on the
balls.
At times Wright showed flashes of
his Eastern form, particularly In chop
ping down the side lines. ' Many of the
.spectators were disappointed in the
champion, but this was due to the fact
that he is by no means a showy player.
Hi? forte <s steadiness and head work.
Murdock and Smith did not play their
best jrame at the start. In the first
set they fell down frequently In easy
shots. In one game they had a lead
of 40 â 0 on Wright's service, but
missed several a*sy ones.
In the second set Murdock and Smith
were slow to start, and it seemed the
set would be a short one. The players
braced with the score 4â24 â 2 against
them and took the next three games.
The score was evened up on the tenth
Came, but the next two games and set
went to Murdock and Smith.
The third set was the best of the
three. Tobin and Smith played their
best tennis' in this set. Murdock
missed considerably In the early stages,
but toward the end 'played good ten
nis. Smith volleyed and smashed In his
old-time form in the last set.
A strange court and partner and the
fact that he has not played for two
months caused Wright to make a
poorer showing than he would other
wipe, have done. In a singles match
the champion would undoubtedly show
to better advantage.
The annual meeting of the board of
directors of the California Lawn Ten
nis Club was held last night. It \vas .
decided to give a banquet In honor of
Beals C Wright Saturday evening at
7 o'clock. Judge Hunt' and Grant Smith
were appointed a committee to take
charge of the affair. All tennis en
thusiasts are Invited. Tickets may be
had at the California Club. \u25a0
Stanford Stndent Body Dlrldrd.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 21.â The
student body of the Stanford University Is at
present sharply divided. A â¬hort time agro the
athletic committee met and decided to aws.rd
the* membere of tho varsity boat crew the
block "*S" hereafter. The executive body of
the associated etudents declares they j had no
authority to make this concession, as it Is &
questfdn of paramount Issue and should be
brought t*f ore a higher boay- than the athletic
committee., which Is nominally- supposed to
exiet merely for the purpose of formally vot
ing to the members of various teams the var-
Fity sweater which the student- body have be
fore decided shall t* awarded to winners in
athletics. At present no provisions has been
made for the members of the crew, as, in the
minds of a large part of the etudent body, the
eport has not reached a degree of proflciency
to receive the highest honor.
Love alone can lift the lost.

The shades of night descended gently
upon the; Eighth street lot 'â¢" yesterday
afternoon at. the end of the ninth Inning
. when the Seals. and. the Tigers were a tie
on tho score board. Had it not been
for fieorgie Hildebrand's frantic efforts
to come home and win the game in the
eighth, San. Francisco would have lef t :
the fl(;ld a run to the good. -.
Bobby Keefe was hit in spots while
Williams' got his all over and all the way
through. It is a wonder the Tigers did
not rnp him for a dozen runs the way
they were bingling. The hits came when
they did no good and Williams had a
happy faculty of striking men out just
when a run seemed due to come over.
The Tigers had annexed two in the
second. The Seals showed no signs of
life till Shea opened up the third with a
drive to center. Nordyke had the
jimmies^ for a moment when Waldron
hit his grounder to Eagan and the throw
was dropped by the first baseman. Shea
pulled up at third and -Mohler put him
through with a long fly â¢ to \u25a0'. McLaughlin.
The Tigers landed in the sixth and
again the Seals came up strongly In the
seventh. With two already gone, Irwin
singled. He was followed . by Gochnauer,
who turned the same trick. Shea showed
he was the hittingr kid for the day by
rapping: out another and \u25a0 bringing Irwin
through." - \u25a0
The game would - have - ended in the
eighth had -not -Hilde tried to - get home
on his three bagger- and on a wild
throw. : With Mohler on first, he lined
orro to the farther"; corner ; of the ' center
field fence.. He tore over, the; sacks ; and
pulled up at ' third safely. ' The throw to
the bag was -bad and. Hilde : figured he
could get home, but Sheehan recovered
the ball in j a "twinkling 'and winged \u25a0 his
man out at the plate.
â¢ Charley- Graham hurt his hand In the
eeventh and . had to retire \u25a0: from the
game. The â¢ Tacoma leader does not
think the injury will be serious enough
to keep him out of the post season series,
though It Is. a bad looking \ gash. The
score: \u25a0 \u25a0 .

Jimmy Gardners. brilliant showing in

and with Buddy Ryan have given "â¢ him

installed a pronounced 7 'to 10 .favorite.'; It
seemed all the betting ; men ' Wanted to
have a little wager, down on him. . ,'*
Sullivan has many, admirers in the East.
Matt .Larkin. tho well-known sporting
man, received a letter i from Jim Cof
froth yesterday in ; which lie said .the
best' Judges of boxing in the East con
cede Sullivan a . good ) chance ; to beat.
Gardner, lie said not to overlook the
I Twin. Both men , are . hard hitters with
Gardner the cleverest ; boxer. : It is a
treat to see" him at work. /Sullivan is a.
I two-handed lighter of undoubted game
ness and aggressiveness. "'"
If Sullivan defeats Gardner he will be
heralded as the : greatest ,â¢ boxer in his
class, while Jimmy will -be compelled to
praciicallj- start â¢ anew. ; if the. battle
should iirove one of success for Gardner
there will be few good,' men for him to
meet unless, he : be. fortunate enough to
induce either Jimmy Britt or Battling
Nelson to concede him a, little' weight.
There has been a great deal said about
the weights' of the' boxers- .While there
are many who believe Sullivan; will have
the advantage In -that "'.respect there are
others who think Gardner -will 'enter the
ring weighing more than 140 pounds. Sul
livan, with his free and' easy way and his
Jovial disposition, will.be apt to go, into
the ring weighing every ounce it is | pos
sible for him to carry in comfort and.be
at his best. -:\u25a0- Gardner, who is. of , anerv
ous temperament' and frets -and worries
much on the eve of a battle that Is. known 'â¢
to be a hard one, is likely "; to go to the
scratch | about as . light as it is possible

imagine.: : ,
,; "Big Bill", Knapp took the first event,
a 'mile. Belling run, for which a field
of twelve started, with Firm ; Foot.
The gelding went to the post at 4 to C,
and after 'being stretched out some to
overtake ' Lady Mirthful, beat the mare
easily at the close. The show went to
Dr.; Roberts.
In his present form F. E. Shaw is

COURSING MEN
ARE HARD HIT
Action of /the San Mateo
County Supervisors Conies
as Great. Surprise to Them
MAY ADJUST MATTERS
Officials Hope to Unravel
the Tanglev and to Be
Allowed to Continue Sport
The followers of coursing: In thi9 city
have not recovered yet from the surprise
they received yesterday when they
j learned of the severe action taken. by
the ; San Mateo County Supervisors OnT>
Monday. "Without giving the slightest
hint of their intentions, they passed a
.meaiure which will go into effect two
\u25a0weeks hence putting a stop to coursing.
1 The park officials had no intimation
of the proposed action. They said yes
terday that no petition had been circu
lated attacking coursing and that no
complaint had beeen made by Colma
residents.
The park license of $600 a year la
paid up to May of next year. Tho same
tax ; is .. imposed yonv on Tanforan iaea
course. In this city both the coursing
park and the racetrack are taxed only
$75 per year.
" The . coursing . ofSclala did not seem
perturbed yesterday over the unexpect
ed change in the situation. They took
no steps In the matter, but seemed In
clined -to think the tangle would b Â»
unYaveled and that the coursing would
go on Interruption.
.Persons who are In touch with tha
boxing game at Colma profess to see In
the action of the Supervisors an at
tempt to hurt Manager Coff roth, who la
also Interested in the coursing park.
The trouble dates back to the Britt-
Kelson figbt, which left some sore
spots, as do all such big affairs. There
\u25a0were many deputies to be employed and
valuable concessions to be disposed of.
There was friction at the time, and the
reports of the golden strean# which 13
flowing into the manager's strong bos
from the moving pictures taken at tho
fight do not allay the feeling. Boxing
was not placed under, the ban Monday. v
There are ho bouts scheduled for Colma^
at present. As Manager Coff roth Is In
the good graces of the administration
here he may elect to give up his Colma
pavilion and promote all his fights in
thl3 city.
If the park. Is closed permanently
many coursing men will be -affected.
One park~cannot accept all the dogs In
training and run them in a two-day
meeting each week.
Stanford "Will Use Old Traefc.
STA>TFORD UNIVERSITY. Xov. 21.â Tha
members of the "Training House Corporation"
of the Stanford University held a meeting last
. night to discuss the proposition of a suitable
daaer path for the Intercollegiate traclc meet,
wh'ch Is to be held here.
X is probable that tho old track will ba re
paired to serve another year, as there is
scarcely, time remaining to construct the new
flelll properly.
The site will, however, be graded In readiness
should It finally be decided to abandon the old

FOR TEN DAYS
Winding Schooner Gotama
Ends Crnise Without Any
Food in Her Lockers
BELIEVED BY OLYMPIC
Passing Steamer Supplies
Some Provisions. But Not
Enough, to Satisfy Hunger
Hunger was added to the hardships
of the men on the whaling, schooner
Gotama, which arrived yesterday from
a nine months' chase after whales. For
the last tea days of the voyage of
ficers and crew, thirty-one souls all
told, had been on short rations, and
with starvation gnawing at their vitals
h:id been compelled to work nigrht and
any to save their vessel from the
Â»\u25ba\u25a0} eavy winter storms which beset her
path.
The run home from Shanter Bay
occupied nearly two months. For the
hist three weeks the Gotama has been
within a few days' sail of this port.
Captain Macombcr did not look for
such opposition from the elements and
the whalers larder was not equipped
lor a voyage of such length.
On November 10 it was discovered
that the beef barrel was empty. All
hands, fore and aft, were put upon a
xation of flour and hard bread, and
not too much of either. On November
17 the Â£team schooner Olympic was
spoken off Crescent City and from her
Captain Macombcr obtained what he
thought would be sufficient food to
carry him to San Francisco. The
stores from the Olympic permitted a
variation but no large increase of
the ration, and when the Gotama an
chored yesterday off Fort Point every
bit of food had been eaten and thirty
one empty stomachs were groaning
under tightened belts for solid grub.
The Gotama killed only four small
\u25a0whales, which yielded 1350 pounds of
bone and 125 barrels of oil.
She left here February 11. She
reached Pagan Island April 10. Seventy
miles west-northwest of Pagan the sea
was covered with pumice stone, and for
3 000 miles, yntil Loochoo Channel was
reached, the. surface of the water was
thick with the volcanic rock.
On the homeward run several heavy
Etorms were encountered. For twenty
hours the Gotama raced under bare
* poles before a howling northwester-
She lost neither sails nor spars, how
ever, and reached port in good condi
tion.
The Gotama is probably the last of
the whalers that will reach port this
season.
Whiie in the Okhotsk Sea Third Mate
August Schrnager and Boat Steerer J.
K. Holmes engaged in a flght In one of
the whaleboats. Both men were un
der the influence of liquor. In the
course of the scrap somebody pulled
the trigger of the whale gun and a
hole was shot through the bottom of
the boat. Other boats were launched
and those in the sinking craft rescued,
including the suddenly sobered bellig
erents. -.;..>
The Gotama's crew will receive for
their nine months' work JI apiece.

CENTRAL SUMMARY.
TbÂ» weather was generally clear and cool in
the ceatcai ard northern eectioss and warm
â¢md clear :a lhe south. FroÂ£ts occurred In
!>ortlonÂ» of the Interior, but caused no rtam
.' mt*. Lljht rain fell in some Fectior.e on the
I'Jth end 17ih cud srenÂ«ral iisfct rain in the
certral and noriljem fcectiocs on the 19th.
Co^l north vir.ds prevailed at the close of ttie
week. . -
The rain mÂ«Â» beneficial ia many respects,
iÂ»ut uas too lisrht ia most fclacps to solten
the coil or etart pastui-age. The atmosphere
vi'as cleattd and forest fires in the footuill
districts Â»ere t-xtiiiKUished. The soli absorbed
â¢1! of the mater ihmt Sel\, but more rain is
needed at once to enable farmers to com-
J.>lete plowJiiK and seeding. In the southern
â¢â¢ction tht sell is in excellent condition since
the reoent heavy rair.?: pasturage haa started
arij farm work is progressing rapidly. \u25a0 The
tirought in the central and northern section*
!.8Â» been the longest in recent years, but as
"Set the farming interests' "have not Buffered
t-triously, .rhe principal injury having been to
stock raisers, dairymen ard mlnln*.
Tlie weather was eÂ«j>ecia!)y beneficial 1 to
Southern California oranges, which are ripen
ing- rapid'y and look well; it is expected that
sarnie shipments will be made for the Thanks-
Klving trad<Â». Orange picking continues in
the I'orterville and orovilie dUtricts and con-
Mdfrable quantities have bet-n shipped. Wal
uuts and olives ar* being gathered.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â CooI and clear
, -weather r>re\-alled most of the week, with fre
\u25a0^VJ^nt light frostc. The rain on Sunday wÂ«Â«
-^. . liKht to be of much benefit in the valleye,
I bin was heavier in the-JÂ«otbl_U_an(l_mountaln
districts and In tom^ sections was sufficient
to start pasturage. Forest flres, which have
been destroying valuable property In the foot
lii'.ls for some time, were extinsuished by
the rain. The long continued drought has left
ihe soil in poor condition for cultivation and
caused a scarcity of feed for cattle. Dry
eec-cine continues in some claces, bat farm
work generally Is at a standstill. Orangres
art In excellent condition and picking U pro
gressing; pro?j>ectE are good for a large crop.
OMve ricking Is in progress. Grape shipments
are being- made from Sacramento.
COASI AND BAY SECTiONE. â Cool weather
prevailed during the week, with light showers
In some sections Thursday and general light
rain Sunday. The rain was beneficial In many
wa>s but hardly sufficient to soften the soil
or 'start feed except In a few places. Cool
north wind? followed the rain at the* close
of ihe <mt Plowing and dry seeding are
lirogrei<sing in isome sections, but most farmers
ere waiting rÂ°r more rain. Dry feed is very
scarce in most places' and cattie are In poor
condition. \u25a0 Oranee and lemon trees in the
Sana Clara Valley have Buffered from the
long <3:-> sih-ht. but are in good condition In
"the Cloverdale district "aad give promise of-*
large crop.
SAN JOAQtrjN VAL.T.KY.â CIear weather
vrith cool nights prevailed during the forepart
of tfce week and cloudy weather with foggy
mornings" the iatter part. Litht showers oc
Â»-urred in some portions of the valley on Thurs
day and light general rain Sunday and Bun
day night. The rain was too light to be of
much benefit except to lay the dust. Dry
plowing nj\<l seeding are progressing- in the
northern portion of the valley. Orange and
lemon picking are progressing and large crops
of excellent quality will be harvested. Ship
ments of dried fruit continue to Eastern mar
kets. Large shipments of potatoes continue to
southern points from Stockton. Stock are
h<?aithy but losing flesh owing to lack of pas
ture. R*ln is badly needed in all sections
for green feed and farm work.
SOCTIIERN CALIFORNIA. â Warm and
generally clear weather prevailed during tbÂ«
week with light rain in some sections on the
I7ih. The warm weather was beneficial to
.~**::nge% tad range grass. The soil la in very
-d condition and plowing and seeding are
Vrogressing rapidly. Pasturage has made a
irood istart since the recent heavy rains and
e-ome of tlie early Â«owa grain Is showing green.
Walnuts were not seriously damaeed by the
rain and harvest continue*. Oranges are ripen
ing rapidly and come shipments will be made
Jor the Thanksgiving trade. The outlook is
Kood for an excellent crop of orarxes and
lemons in nearly all sections and It U ex
pected several carloads will be shipped Bast
:or the Christmas holiday trade.
EUREKA SUMMARY.â Oraas Is very short.
â¢Dairy interests suffered during the long con
tinued drought and many stock raisers are
feeding hay. Rain the latter portion of the
week will enable farmers to resume plowing.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY. â The warm
days and cool nights following the rain are
coloring ermngÂ«B nicely, trot generally slow,
isome holiday shipments have been made.
Vegetation , is well 6tarted: good green feed
tireaiiy In somÂ« of the lowlands. Much plow
ing and eeedlss In proyre*Â».

NEW TOHK. Nov. VX. â ThlÂ« was another
-*Â»* of rÂ«ry broad *oÂ»d active speculation In
Jl&* stock market. Plenty of evidence of the
Â£rfcr-g *bÂ»crr>Uve po*frtr or thÂ» market was
sftown and tbÂ«re were signs as well Of the
extension of Interest in outside quarters at
tracted by the rapid rise In prices of thfe last
tow days. But It was obvious also that a
liberal CistrliJutton of stacks was going onto
take exlvam&se of the gro-Â«rtn ot Interest. The
violent advcncps In prices which hayÂ« occurred
ioft>r such hatifisoroe profits in many cases that
th* inducement to reaiize en holdings Is strong.
The markrt thowÂ«d the effects of this move
ment ea the cay progressed and became ir
regular and al tiaes reactionary. Some stocks
were affected by orofit taklr.g upon the an
nouncement of eood new*, while In a few cases
<he character of tfce pressure upon r stocks gmvÂ«
the jmpn*fica of seme poslUve factor of weak
nÂ»Â«s. Tn ihe latter class were the Metropolitan
Tsactitm stocks. In tfce former were Atlantic
â¢ â¢oast Ijine. Th* acUon ot that stock proved
that -the demand on account of. the proposed iu
â¢ 'â¢a-;*, in the dividend *uad been filled mostly
"before the â¢.naounccment cf the Increase which
came to-<iay. On UlO report that the Â«ani-an

There was another stage in the speculative
advance ia lieaÂ«JinÂ«r and . Baltimore aad Ohio

further progress toward relaxation, but It is
felt that ihls progress has about reached its
limits under the conditions existing. . The suto
1 pcrlptions to the Japanese loan, it is believed,
I will not be payable until next year except for
f Kmall preliminary installments. Sterling ex
' change declined in this market, but New York
: exchange at Chicago also dropped back to 2j
, certs premium compared with 40 cents prem
i ium yesterday and views of the return flow
' of currency to New York were modified ac
â¢ cordingly. The pressure on the Southern rail
: read stocks was aggravated late In the day
by the heavy falling oil In the ginning of
cotton indicated by the Census Bureau's re
port, which precipitated a panic among the
bfurs on the Cotton Exchange. The irregular
: tone Of the latter market was not altered by the
violent bidding up of Brooklyn Transit and
National Lead and last prices were In many
cases below those of last nizht.

Tbe Republican County' Committeemen
ir.et last night at the old ; fusion head
quarters at C 6 Market street and unani
mously decided to postpone the election
of a chairman and secretary and the
organization of the committee until Jan
uary 23, next. The move was urged by
Fairfax W'heelan in a long speech, in
\u25a0which he reviewed the committee's work
during the last campaign and referred to
The harmoney existing in Republican
ranks. After adopting a brief resolution
extending sympathy to the oppressed and
persecuted Jews of Southern Russia, the
committee meeting was declared adjourn
ed by Chairman Daniel A. Ryan until
January 23.
Mr. Wheelan, in moving, that the date
of election and organization be '- post
poned, said that the Republican* League
had no apology for Its past work. He
added that every member worked for
what each believed to be. the right and
that fusion was the best political move
at the time. Mr. Wheelan paid a tribute
to Partridge and said that no honest
man, whether friend or foe, fails to honor
him. He predicted the ultimate triumph
cf the Republican party and the opening
of the people's eyes to the real issue of
the last campaign, honesty against dis
honesty.

an unknown man on Sunday 'night,
November 5, went to Justice Edgar'sJ ;
office this morning, and asked for the:

of having feloniously attacked her. \\
Mis=s Olsen signed a statement exonerat-*.

under pressure, exerted by McNulty 'tf.
frif nds and relations, among them his*
brother. Dr. Charles McNulty. a sur-'

all that was involved in the act of sign- ;
ing the statement- in question. She now
says that McNulty was identified by her
as her assailant on the day : he first camei
to the home" of J. A. Marshal, at Stuart!
and Telegraph avenue, shortly after the'
stories of his attack upon her had been^
published. j,
McNulty. was informed of the young
woman's act this morning and promptly;
resigned his position ; as deputy County"
Clerk. He came from Oakland to'
Berkeley with Detective Henry Jamison;
secured bondsmen in the persons of
George Schmidt and Daniel Fraser, who
qualified 'in the: sum \u25a0 of '.$3000,. and
spent the afternoon in Oakland 'engaging
counsel to defend him. â¢ .'- *
CONSCIENCE COMPELS ACTION.
Miss Olsen was accompanied by her
brother, Charles, when she visited Justice
Edgar this morning. She ! informed the
Judge, in broken English, that "she could
not any longer bear it all," explaining
that her .conscience, would not let her
rest, when she permitted McNulty, to go
unscathed, -after recognizing in him her
assailant of two weeks ago.
The story of the attack upon her was
repeated to the Judge. She declared that
on the evening of November 5, she vis
ited Oakland, and on the return trip she
sat beside a man, whom she- identifies
as 'McNulty, who eyed her until she be
came uneasy, and who followed her when
she left the car to go to Mr. Marshal's
home at Stuart ana Telegraph avenue,
where she was employed as a domestic

The girl's assailant fled when the sound

but his overcoat* was [retained in the j

as a' clew and later .proved that it was
Lester McNulty's garment. McNulty
was informed of the V-j evidence J - against
him, and went to. Miss Olsen's home, ac
companied by his /^brother, Charles,
according, to Miss. Olsen's story. The girl
