ALBANY. N. T., Jan. 3.â Drastic
comment upon the conduct of the Trust
Company cf the Republic in connection
with the affairs of the United States
Shipbuilding Company is a feature of
the annual report of Superintendent
Kilbourn of the State Bank Depart

"Upcn the first intimation that the

"a special inquiry was instituted by
me to ascertain the facts, and I was
amazed to find that undertakings had
been entered into and liabilities in

solvency of the trust company, but
flagrantly transgressed the law.
"The company had made numerous
loans without collateral other than
Ehipbuilding stocks and securities, one
of them to Mr. Dresser, the president of
the company, and to Mr. ICixon, for
nearly a million and three-ouarters of

Traveler's Observations Regarding the
Czar's and Mikado's Fighting Men.
William Benjamin Jones, a Califor
nian, who eight years ago left San
Francisco for Alaska, arrived In this
city on Saturday, after having passed
the last year and a half in Northeast
ern Siberia, where he was prospecting.
On his travels Jones has been en
abled to form an opinion of the Japan
ese, for whom he professes the highest
respect. He admires them as soldiers
and believes that should Japan engage
in war with Russia the Tartar would
find a hard fighter in the little brown
man.
Jones said yesterday when discussing
the prospect of war:
A conflict Is Inevitable between Japan and
Russia. The Utter seeks to possess Korea,
which ambition the Japanese oppose with de
termination. Besides that controversy, there
Is keen feeling of resentment by the Japanese,
arising out of the fishing question, as a num
ber of Japanese schooners have been siezed
by the Russian*, who claim that the Jap
anese fishermen have encroached on their fish
ing grounds. . â¢ ,
From my personal observation, the Russians
will meet a foe superlqr to anything they
dream of. I believe In the event of war that
the Japanese would ' be victorious. â¢
The Japanese have a standing army of 130.-
CCO and a good navy, and they have their ships
practically In the waters where the conflict
would take place. They are fatalists and all of
the same mind and in my opinion will fight like
the Boers, with the added advantage that they
have a well-equipped and intelligently manned
navy. . Â¦
In case of an attempted invasion, th* pop
ulation, which practically lives on the sea
coast, would contribute a million of men to
protect that coast. The Japanese are splen
didly drilled and up to date, which was proved
in the advance on Peking when they passed
tbÂ© Russians and met. the Chinese and sur
prised the combined armies of the world with
their valor.
THE JAPAN'ESE SOLDIER.
Again, the Japanese eoldlers are active and
educated and to a certain extor.t understand
tho Enellsh language. They adopt the new
est of methods and through their success over
China they believe they are equal to any na
tion on earth as fighters. They are extremely
well fed on their national diet, which con
sists chiefly of rice, flsh, fruits and vegeta
bles.
Two-thirds of the male population of
Russia is subject to call for military
duty. 1 Their pay I s ridiculously small,
being no more than three or four rou
bles, or $1 50 to $2 American money, a month.
Their ' food consists of black bread and salt
n>h and they are Inveterate cigarette smokers.
They do not knbw the value of life and are
utterly ignorant of civilized customs. Fear,
Instilled into them from childhood, makes
them loyal, as a frown or whisper, they fear,
will .land them in the home of the exlle^ â
bleak, dreary Siberia. This acts as a fearful
menace. These people i are ruled by a rod of
iron and it Is fear that keeps them from going
headlong aeainst their Government.
I waa told by an English officer in Yoko
hama that he witnessed from his ship the
drilling of Russian marines. He was horrified
to see the drilling o'fleers with whips, driving
the men around like so many horses. People
who have witnessed these cruelties do not be
lieve that the men so treated. will fljcht Ilka
the patriotic Japanese, who are treated with
consideration. .
The completion of the Siberian Railway and
its extension to Port Arthur Is a strong fac
tor for Russia. Coal has been piling up there
as fast as ships could carry it for several
years, and there is . no doubt that she is well
prepared for trouble.
RUSSIA'S FOKTIFIED PORTS. .
There is a Rueslan force available to-day be
tween Port Arthur, and Vladivostok of 100.
000 men. Both those ports are almost Impreg
nable, and Japan In case of success In a naval
encounter, would endeavor to land soldiers- at
one of the numerous uncarrljjoned points on
tne iÂ»horÂ« line. ' :
I have travelel frcm.the border*, of Korea
to above the Arctic circle on the Siberian
shore. It U a vast unexplored- district, prac
tically defenseless and ungarrtsoned, with the
exception of a few Cossacks here and there.
The shore line extends something like a dis
tance of 300O miles and Is sparsely populated
by natives, who. from close observation, are,
I should say, descendants of Qilnese. As a
rule they have very little use for the Rus
sian, under whose rule they chafe.
Of late this population, which depends on
bartering its whalebone. Ivory, fox and bear
skins to American whale ships, has been de

PORTLAND, Jan.. 3. â Significant of
the likelihood of war between Russia
and Japan is the raising of the Orien
tal, flour rate by all the trans-Pacific
lines. An -agreement between the
Portland, San Francisco and northern
lines was reached, fixing $5 as the
February tariff. However, as the
agreement was not signed, the San
Francisco companies backed down to
the extent of a dollar. The Puget
Sound lines so far have stood by the
advance. The Portland and Asiatic
Company has made no announcement
of its intentions. It is safe to say that
if It finds the $5 rate cannot be main
tained it will fix its tariff at $4. A
settlement of the matter is expected
to-morrow. , General Freight Agent
Miller of the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company Is now in San
Francisco and Â¦ a telegram from him
announcing a fixed rate for February
shipments is expected at any moment.
The advance in the flour rate from
$3 is attributed entirely to the pros
pect of war in Asia. It Was reported
on the water front yesterday that
Laidlaw & Co. had withdrawn their
bids made to the Government for the
transportation of fodder to the Philip
pines upon the contract expected to
be awarded to Portland grain and hay
dealers. The reason for the with
drawal was stated to be the imminence
of war in the Far East. Inquiry at the
office of the company brought out the
response that a telegram to that effect
had been received from the steamship
owners in London, but it was counter
manded soon after and the offer to the
Government will hold good for a few
days longer.

The Times' Shanghai correspondent
says the American syndicate has
ordered the suspension of work on the
Canton and Hankow railroad, with the
exception of the seventeen-mile Fat
shan section, which was recently
opened. This stop, the correspondent
says, probably has been taken pending
the issue of negotiations which are
still proceeding with reference to the
separation of the Belgian and Ameri
can interests in the railway.
The same correspondent says that a
native journal is publishing the full
text of telegrams which passed be
tween Li Hung Chang and the Tsung
li-yamen (Chinese Foreign Office) in
April, 1S96. when Li Hung Chang was
at St. Petersburg, arranging for a
Manchurian railway convention. These
dispatches show that Russia threaten
ed to ally herself with Japan unless
she were granted facilities to construct
the railway, which she represented as
Intended to facilitate the dispatch of
troops for the protection of Russian
and Chinese territory against the ag
gression of . other powers, principally
Japan. The local Japanese officials
are profoundly impressed by these doc
uments, which, says the correspondent,
are undoubtedly genuine. He adds
that the publication of the documents
cannot fail to Intensify Japanese irri
tation.
Tho Times' Shanghai correspondent
says that both the Russian and the
Japanese Governments are buying sil
ver, principally In dollars, In Shanghai
and Hongkong for shipment to the
north.
"The situation is extremely critical.
Russia maintains profound silence.
Failing some conciliatory action on
the Dart of Russia, of which there is
now no appearance whatever, Japan
will certainly adopt within a few days
active measures to secure her vital in
terests. After this, war will become
very difficult to avoid."

Joined the proceedings brought by the
Attorney General with an examination
by the court, through a referee, upon
the petition of the company itself (for
the purpose of ascertaining the safety
of the investments and the j prudence
of the management of the corporation).
That Inquiry was continued for nearly
six months, with exeat latitude per
mitted to the company in its efforts to
sustain Its contention and to destroy
the case made against it by this depart
ment's examination. But the referee
found agajnst the company at substan
tially every point. In fact, he found the
company In some respects In wors"e con
dition than the report of the examiners
would indicate, and he charged Its offi
cers with making- false reports to this
department. Upon the presentation 'of
the referee's report, Justice Herrick de
clared from the bench that after a care
ful ftudy of it. and upon an independ

it which he had himself made, he was
satisfied that the.company was in even
worse condition than, the referee de
clared It to be, and Justice Durgo later
granted the motion for the appointment
of a receiver, who is now in possession."
"Upon the communication by me of

proceedings for the 'dissolution of the

"Some of these withdrawals it was
paying or compromising out of the or

of law, and it had been crediting divi
dends that not only had not been
earned, but was apportioning them in
equitably between different classes of
stockholder*?. The premiums that it
was charging to borrowing members
for loans. Including them in the mort
gages It took, were so exorbitant that
no' other conclusion was made possible
than that the borrowers must regard
their transactions as a xirtual sale of
property to the company, whose real
estate holdings were increasing rapidly
and were being carried at a heavy an
nual loss. It was treating the pre

premiums would not be actually paid

"The report of the examination of the

mind that the affairs of the company
had reached such a state that It would
be culpable in me to longer hesitate to
take action against it. Withdrawals

the end, for it was only by the procur

JAPAX IS UNDERESTIMATED.
Russian Officers Scoff at Island Na
tion's. Belligerent Attitude.
PEKING, Jan. 3.â In the various for
eign legations here the opinion is pre
valent that war between Japan and
Russia 'is certain. This opinion Is based
upon the/ latest dispatches from Tokio
and the conviction that it is not a ques
tion of detail which separates Rus
sia and Japan, but the vital principle
whether Japan possesses the right to a
voice In the settlement of the question
of Russian occupation of Manchuria.
Russia has all along denied this right,
and unless her reply shows that she
has receded from this position, which is
not expected to be the case, it probably
will Invoke an ultimatum from Japan,
whose determination to resort to-arms
in support of her claim is unques
tioned.
Advices from Manchuria-, represent
tho Russian officials there as being sur
prised at Japan's readiness to fight.
They expected that she would submit
at the last moment, as she did in 1895,
when she surrendered Port 'Arthur at
the bidding of the European coalition.
The Russian officials rely for support
upon the same powers that aided the
Russian government on that occasion.
Moreover, the Russians have confidence
in their ability to win in the event of
war. Among the Junior officers this
feeling takes the form of despising the
enemy.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 3.â Thert was a
remarkable scene at the Sixth Street
Methodist Church to-night when the
pastor, the Rev. W. W: Case, delivered
a sermon elaborating the twenty-five
reasons why the Tuesday Literary Club
should not give the society dance pro
posed for next Thursday ni-fht. Lon;
before the lights of the church were
turned on the sidewalk waa crowded
with men and women anxious to gain
admission.
When the pastor ascended the pulpit
the large auditorium was packed to the
point of discomfort and ushers were
at the doors sending hundreds away.
The Rev. Mr. Case began with vigor
and attacked the dance on moral and
ethical grounds as he had explained
In advance in The Call. He said that
since the publication of his views on
the subject he had been called upon by
scores of men and women who congrat
ulated him upon his stand. He added
that he had nothing to detract and
proceeded to denounce dancing in un
measured terms, charging: it with much
of the immorality of the present day.
"I know," exclaimed the pastor, "that
my name is being cursed in the dance
halls and dives of San Francisco to
night, as it is in the palaces of sin In
Sacramento. But I am here tu speak
the truth concerning this modern eviL'*
At the conclusion of his sermon the
Rev. Mr. CÂ£se was besieged by mem
bers of his congregation, both men and
women, who, amid handshakes, ex
pressed their approval of his words.
The unusual spectacle was presented
of fashoinably dressed young women
and young men going forward and
pledging the pastor their word that
they would hereafter refrain from
dancing.
While the Rev. Mr. Case has stirred
the religious sentiment of a portion of
the population by his attack upon the
"Tuesday Club's full dress oall." thera
is no abatement in the preparations for
the event, and the society women who
have it in charge declare that for every
reason the Rev. Mr. Case can offer why

ROME. Jan. 4.â The newspapers announce
the arrival here of Boris Sarafoff. leader of
the Macedonian revolutionists.
Mrs. Oelrichs* California trip, her
friends say. resulted in an understand

fully recomiled to him and somewhat
regretful of her hasty action in revok

in all business matters.
It is understood that Mrs. Oelrichs
f<*els uneasy about the case, and with
characteristic energry has determined to
tnmbat r>ersonally the contestants. At
all events upon her return from Cali
fornia a fpw days ago she announced
her plan of going abroad at once. The
Jiln^Fs of Hermann Oelrichs Jr.
has delayed the carrying out of her
plans. Mrs. Oelriehs was alarmed upon
her return to find the little fellow suf
fering from a severe cold, but he is
rapidly recove'ring and soon will be in
(ondition to make the voyage across
tho ocean. A nurse and maid will be

NEW YORK. Jan. 2.â Alarmed by the

Fair, who with her husband was killed
In an automobile accident near Paris
more than a year ago. Mrs. Hermann
Oelrlchs. it was learned to-day, has de
cided to proceed to Paris as soon as
possible to give the case her personal
attention.
Testimony of the most positive char

quiry in Paris to chow that Charles L.
Fair. Mrs. Oelrichs 1 brother, died be
fore his wife, and if this can be estab

Special Di*rÂ«tch to Thf Call
When the House reassembles to-mor
row it will be confronted by almost
bare calendars. Only a few items of
legislation have been reported by com
mittees, and all these are of compara
tive Insignificance. It therefore will be
necessary for the House to wait for a
few days upon its committees before
beginning the transaction of complete
business. The disposition is to take up
no matters of general interest outside
of appropriation bills, and there is no
appropriation measure in shape to be
reported from committee. The legisla
tlver executive and judicial bill will be
the first to receive attention, but there
is no expectation that it will be report
ed from the Appropriation Committee
before Friday or Saturday. In the
meantime the House will consider pri
vate pension bills and other questions
of not much Importance unless some
matter should be taken up for general
discussion. The week, however, will be
one of great activity in the committee
rooms.
The Committee on Military Affairs
probably will report the nomination of
General Leonard Wood at the first ex
ecutive session. A meeting of the com
mittee has been called for to-morrow,
with the understanding that a vote on
the nomination shall be taken. There
will be an effort to secure consideration
of the nomination as soon as possible.
The nomination probably will lead to
much debate.
LIGHT WORK FOR HOUSE.
Senator Lodge will uphold in an elab
orate speech the right of the President
to recognize the independence of Pan-,
ama at the time and in the manner in
which President Roosevelt save them
rr-cognition. Senator McComas also has
intimated his intention to discuss this
subject. The committee is expected to
report the canal treaty by the middle of
the week, and it is the intention of the
friends of the administration to press
its consideration as rapidly as possible,
with the^idea of getting the speeches
out of the way and having the treaty
disposed of as early as possible. With
the treaty once reported they will make
an effort to confine the discussion to the
executive sessions in the hope that by
so doing they will shorten the consider
ation of the question.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.â After a re
cess of more than two weeks the Senate
will resume business to-morrow with
out any definite programme. Indeed, it
may be stated the Senate has no pro
gramme for the entire session beyond
the passage of the appropriation bill,
the consideration of the Panama canal
treaty, the determination of Senator
Smoot's case and the disposition of
some other comparatively unimportant
matters.
One of the appropriations, namely,
the pension bill, has reached the Sen
ate, and that has not yet been consid
ered in committee. It is probable, how
ever, that it wiil be reported at an early
date. The Panama canal treaty also is
In committee, and it also probably will
be reported to the Senate during the
present week. The Smoot case will be
prooppded with by tho Committee on
Privileges, but the indications are that
some weeks wJll elapse before the ques
tion can be brought before the Senate
in regular order. Notwithstanding the
fact that the canal treaty Is not at
present in the Senate, there is little
doubt that the canal question will form
the leading topic for discussion during
the week. Senator Lodge will speak on
this subject on Tuesday, and it is quite
certain he will be followed by other
Senators, especially by some who an
tagonize the attitude of. the administra
tion.

When the street was reached and it
was seen that .there was no cause for
alarm the greater part of the mourners
returned to the church and the ser
vices were finished. Xobody was In
jured.
Many rushed for the doors. Two po
licemen stationed in the church called
out to the people that there was no
danger and urged them to resume their
seata. Their advice. was not heeded,
however; the pall-bearers went to the
side of the casket and stood In readi
ness to remove it, and the family of the
dead girl prepared to leave. Suddenly
a cloud of smoke came in through the
open door and the sight and smell mad
dened the gathering. The two'ofllcers
had barely time to swing the doors open
when the rush came; This was all that
prevented a severe crush and probable
loss of life. â¢ .
A serious panic occurred this after
noon at the funeral of Miss Mary Car
ries, one of the victims of the fire. The
services were In. progress in the South
Chicago^ Congregational Church, in the
suburb of Southt Chicago, and the
building was filled. Fire broke out
three doors from the church and the
first intimation* oT Its was conveyed to
those in the church by a cry of "fire"
in the street.
"(Jne. cannot tell," he, said, "what a
man who has lost all of his family ina
fire like that of Wednesday will do. He
could hardly be held responsible for his
actions." # â¢ . Â¦ .
"FIRE!" CRY STARTS PANIC.
From all indications, the meeting -of
the City Council to-morrow "night will
be taken up entirelyby the introduction
of resolutions relating to the fire.'Ordi
nanccs will be presented covering every
imaginable detail of ' the management

Hardly ten seconds had elapsed be

There were, no more arrests of mem
bers of the "Mr. Bluebeard" company
to-day, and none are expected unless
there be unlooked-for developments.
Assistant Chief of Police Schuettler de
clared that no further obstacle would
be placed in the way of members of the
company who desired to leave the city.
"I have been assured by Klaw & Er

have ordered that there be no further
interference with the departure of the

To-morrow morning Coroner Treager
and the jury empaneled to sit at . the

particular attention will be -paid to any
violation of the building ordinances
that may be found. In accordance with
the request of the members of the jury,
all sightseers and even watchmen will

Outside of the numerous funerals
that were held to-day it was the
first day of rest the city has known
since last Wednesday afternoon. Less
than twenty persons called at the of
fice of the Chief of Police for permits
to visit morgues and few wore at the
hospitals.
A funeral conducted in a liumbler
manner was held a few squares from
the Wolff residence at the same time.
It was that of Mrs. Mary H. Hoist and
her three children, all of whom 'died in
the Ill-fated second ; balcony. Mrs.
Hoist was a sister of ex-Chief of Po
lice Badenoch and it was he who identi
fied the bodies of the mother and her
three children. Fully as many persons
were around the small frame church in
which this funeral gathered as outside
the pretentious Wolff mansion, and
here, too, the police were compelled to
open a passageway for the caskets as
they were borne to the hearses.
These arc but Instances of what oc
curred throughout the length and
breadth of Chicago to-day. Multiply
by twenty the funerals mentioned and
a better idea can be had of this first
Sabbath day in the new year.
The list of dead was increased to 588
to-day by the death of Le Hoy Rain
bolt, a boy of 4 years, who had been
severely burned. ,
Of the ten bodies at the county
morgue four were identified to-day.
They were Mrs. Mary A. Fair, Sadie
Ludwig, Dorothy Lemager, 13 years old,
and Emma Reynolds, 7 years eld.-
The injured, of whom thera is a rec
ord now number 103. although the
number of those who were nurt slight
ly would swell this 'number greatly.
Numbers of persons went to their
homes after the fire without reporting
themselves to the police as Injured.
POLICE SEEKING SCHMIDT.
I,AST RITES OVER FOUR.
The funeral services over Ella and
Edith Freckelton. sisters, was held in
Boulevard hall. Fully 2000 persons were
in attendance, and fully 600 more stood
outside, in the biting wind, until the
funeral had departed for the cemetery.
Tn the home of the millionaire manu
facturer. Ludwig Wolff, was held the
quadruple funeral of his daughter, Mrs.
William G. Garn and her three chil
dren. A crowd of more than 1000 per
sons surrounded the house, and the po
lice were compelled tt> open a passage
way for the pallbearers. The funeral
was one of the largest ever held on the
West Side of the city.
In the rooms of one undertaker a fra
ternal organization held services over
five members of its order at the same
time.
The cemeteries were compelled to
keep men at work all through the night
digging graves, and, in some of the
large cemeteries, they barely managed
to make them with sufficient speed. At
one time to-day fourteen burials' were
in progress in Rose Hill Cemetery. .
CHICAGO. Jan. 3.â To-day was a
day of .funerals in Chicago, and yet
many were unable to bury their dead.
The unprecedented demand for hearses
and carriages would have been enough
in itself to tax to the utmost the re
sources of. the undertakers, but the
heavy snow that has fallen during the
last two days has increased their dif
ficulties enormously. All of the. ceme
teries in . Chicago are miles from the
business center and resident districts,
and with good weather and the streets
in passable condition it requires several
hours to reach any of them. To-day,
when every hearse was in demand, it
required about twice as long to reach
a cemetery as under/normal conditions.
Arrangements were made by the un
dertakers Jo have as many funerals as
possible held in the early part of the
day, v in. order to if possible, the
use of each hearse for a second funeral
in the afternoon. In many instances
families who waited for the return of
a hearse were disappointed and were
compelled to defer the burial of their
loved ones. It is expected that by to
morrow the streets will be in such a
condition as to permit the passage of
funerals in almost the ordinary time.

7 CITIZENS STORY.-
'Told by & Sab Francisco Citizen for the
Benefit of S&a Francisco People.
The greatest importance attached to
the following is that it concerns a San

quarters of its interest if It involved
some resident of Kalamazoo. Mich., or

which has appeared here, and like all
Â¦which wilt follow about the OH! Quaker
remedy. Doan's Kidney Pills, It comes
from residents, fellow citizens and neigh-
bors. No other remedy can show such a
record of home cures. Read this case:
l/ouis SanqUinctti. huckster, of 1319
Irjpont street, says: "I was so crippled
Â¦with pain in my back, in fact I was laid
up with it. that I could not attend to my
*ork. when Doan's Kidney Pills came to
niy notice and I took a course of the
treatment. Previous to that I had ex-
hausted my knowledge of known reme-
dies gathered from reading and pre-
scribed by my friends. Some recom-
mended this and some recommended
that. I took Doan's Kidney Pills as I
had taken other preparations in the past,
with very little expectation of -eceivingr
*ny results, and I must confess I was
more than surprised when the aching in
my back stopped. That is six months

wound is a serious one. There is a bad

The boy showed great courage and
fortitude, for he made his way home

not find time to faint or cry. It was a
long walk, and the wound was painful
and he lost not a little blood, but he
maintained his courape to the last. Dr.
J. H. Callan was called and dressed the
wound. The doctor says that while no
serious results are feared, the young
hunter will remain in bed for a while.
Young Woodmansee, in company with
Walter Whitney, walked out toward

Christmas present, a small rifle, upon
the squirrels that can be found in every

of the new weapon, and he was anxious
to bring home some trophies of his abil
ity to handle it.
It was the old story of trying to drag
the gun through the brush with the
muzzle toward him, and when the trig

right breast, inflicting a serious and

sounded from box 15 at 2:&< o'clock.
When the firemen arrived the hall, roof
and sides were all ablaze. Mrs. Holmes
and her daughter did not awake, until
after the firemen had brokerÂ» into the
unoccupied store on the lower floor,
back of which were the family's living
rooms. Smoke clouded the apartments
and the wonder is that the two wom
en were not overcome.
The fire started in an annex to the
main hall, which was used as a banquet
hall, but had not been in service for
some time. An ironworkers' union held
a meeting In the hall last nighu Miss
Holmes said she went upstairs at 11:30

hours later the building was in flames.

was only a theory.

H. P. Bancroft: -"Oakland has made
greater progress in the last, year than
ever before. 1 More building has been
done, more outside capital invested,
and there is a greater demand for busi
ness locations than ever before during
the history of the city." Suburban resi
dence property has been in great de
mand, Especially in the northern part
of .the city. In short, more real; estate
has changed hands and larger . single
sales have been made in 1903 than ever
before in a single year." Â¦ ,
A.- J. - Snyder: "Our -business during
the. last year has. been greater than
ever before. People who wish -to se
cure residence and business "property
do not seem tg, be particular about the
prices so long as they are suited In re
gard to location and style. -The great
est-demand this* year has been for
modern ? cottages" and ' houses of ' from
PROGRESS IS GREAT.
"One of the great needs of Oakland
at present is one or two first-class cen
trally located commercial hotels, . and
at least one large tourist hotel .to ac
commodate the increased number of
business men and summer visitors. And
more than anything else we need stores
âmodern, well appointed stores. Dur
ing the last year, the rents of stores
in good locations have increased from
twenty to fifty per cent and it is al
most impossible to secure large stores
at anyprie'e. Places oh San Pablo and
Telegraph avenues ' which formerly
rented for $50 and $60 now bring from
$100 to $150, and even at these prices
few are to be had." â¢ -. Â¦Â¦Â¦/'.Â£;?
"In March, 1903, the assessed value of
Oakland real estate was $49,000,000, an
increase^ since 1902 of $5,000,000. The
population of the city In 1890 was. 48,632.
In 1900 it was 66,960. and I should say
that at present the population is about
93,000. I should estimate the trade pop
ulation of Oakland and its suburbs at
150,000. and by 1910 I believe that it
will exceed 250,000."
J. H. Macdonald: "Our -sales last
year amounted to more than. $1,350,000,
which Is .far In- advance of the business
done b ( y us in any previous year. Th.e
prosperity of 1903 is largely duetto the
work of the Oakland' Board of Trade
in advertising the city and interesting
Eastern people in its. rapid develop
ment and splendid location for a com
mercial center. .
VALUES INCREASING.
Following are estimates of the in
crease in business given by well-known
dealers in realty:
W. J. Laymance: "I should say, judg
ing from the business done by our firm,
and from the reports of other dealers,
that the value of real estate that has
changed hands during Xhe last year
will aggregate $10,000,000. More than
$3,000,000 has been invested in the erec
tion of residences, cottages and fiats,
and the value of manufacturing struc
tures and business blocks erected dur
ing 1903 will exceed $2,000,000. . .
"The best y^ar in the history of the
city/'. This is the opinion expressed by
nearly all the local real estate dealers,,
who aerree that, a larger amount of
property has-. changed. hands and more
buildings have been erected than ever
before during- a single year. The year
1903 has witnessed the demolition of
the old market building at Eleventh
and "Washington streets, and the erec
tion of a substantial business block in
Its place. During the last year the
Produce Exchange has been erected, af
fording 1 a commodious place of business
for local commission men; a large new
theater building is In course of con
struction on Broadway, 'near Four
teenth street, and before many months
of the present year have passed Oak
land's first skyscraper, the magnificent
eleven-story office building, which will
be the home of the Union Savings Bank,
will have been completed.

GOOD FORTUNE

The police say that they have an
idea who the assailant of Miss Carney
is and expect to capture him.
Miss Carney was hurriedly removed
to the Emergency Hospital, where Dr.
Millar treated her wounds. She was
weak from the loss of blood "and her
nervps were wrecked ' by the awful
shock. Her" wounds are .not serious,
though had the blade of the razor
gone an inch lower her Jirgular vein
would have been severed and she
would have bled to death.
He overtook them -before they had
gone far and approaching them, said:
"I am going to walk along with you,
girls." The two women, now thor
oughly alarmed, started to run, and
at the same moment the negro, with
an oath, nulled a razor out of his
pocket and started after them.
He soon overtook Miss Carney and
slashed her with the blade. It buried
itself in her neck, just missing the
jugular vein. He made a second slash
at the helpless young woman and in
flicted anotheh cut, laying open her Jaw.
In the meantime Mrs. Knight called
loudly for help. Her cries were an
swered by Patrolman Nye of the North
End police station. As soon as the
negro saw the policeman he took to his
heels and ran along Baker street and
was soon lost in the darkness. The pa
trolman gave chase, but failed to cap
ture the brute.
They continued their tactics and
finally became abusive and insulting.
The women appealed to the conductor
of the car, but he was powerless to
make the blacks cease their insults
and the women became thoroughly
frightened.
When the car reached the corner
of Baker and Greenwich streets Miss
Carney and Mrs. Knight alighted and
started to walk to their home. They
noticed that one of the j colored men
srot off at the same corner, and ob
serving this the women hurried .their
footsteps and sought to avoid the man.
A brutal negro soldier, supposed to be
a member of the Ninth Cavalry Regi
ment, now stationed at the Presidio,
slashed Miss Ethel Carney across the
face with . a razor last night shortly
before midnight at the corner of Baker
and Greenwich streets, which is near
the Presidio entrance. The attack on
the young woman was entirely unwar
ranted, and the burly black, after sev
eral attempts to cut the throat of the
young woman, slunk away in the dark
ness and escaoed.
Miss Carney, in company with Mrs.
J. W. Knight, was returning to their
home, 2588 Lombard street, on a
Union-street car. Seated near them
were five negro soldiers, dressed in
cavalry uniforms. As soon as the two
women entered the car the negroes
made several attempts to speak to
them, but were ignored.
He assured McAndrew, however,
that he would not kill him. and there
upon threw the cartridges from his
revolver into a cuspidor. He then
walked out of the office, but was ar
rested shortly.
Sergeant Ellis and Patrolman
Dower were summoned and had Le
Rivere removed to the Harbor Hos
pital, where it was found that a bul
let had entered the left breast. Can
ivette disappeared before the arriral
of the police and was found some
time after in the fo'castle of the ship
Jean. He was also taken to the hos
pital, and it was found upon examina
tion that a bullet had struck him on
the breast bone. It is feared that the
leaden missile penetrated a vital or
gan. Another bullet inflicted ah
abrasion on his left arm. Both of the
men are" in a precarious condition.
Four shots were fired, and Sprengel
then ran to Crowley's boathouse and
withdrawing the discharged cartridges
from his revolver threw them into a
cuspidor. He then departed, going
toward Market street.
Jim McAndrew, in charge of Crow
ley's boathouse, states that he was
startled by the shots, and just as he
was going outside to investigate Spren
gel rushed into the office floruishing- a
revolver.
As the result of a shooting affray on
East street, near Vallejo, last night
about 11 o'clock, Pasquale Canivette,
a sailor on the French ship Jean, and
Alfred Le Rivere of the ship Ernest
Legouve are lying at the Harbor Hos
pital dangerously wounded.
Captain George Sprengel, who did
the shooting, was captured by Officers
HcPartland and Esola and locked up
in the Harbor station. Sprengel Is
the master of the schooner Neptune,
lying off Filbert-street wharf. He
says that five Frenchmen followed
him and one of them knocked h's hat
off. He feared for his life, he said,
and fired in self-defense.
From the account of Fred Parrott, an
eyewitness to the shooting, the two
wounded men, in company with three
other sailors, were on the way to their
Vessel, lying at Filbert -street wharf.
When near the corner of Vallejo street
Parrott says he saw Sprengel flourish a
revolver at the Quintet and order
them to turn back. Suddenly he com
menced firinc and two of the bullets
found lodgment in the bodies of Cani
vette and Le Rlvene.
"We have a large city correspondence
and send many letter daily. We have
been delayed In our business and great
annoyance has resulted by the non
delivery of letters for two and three
days at a time. In two instances let
ters addressed to residents in this city
and mailed at Station .K at an early
hour in the afternoon did not reach
their destination in the Mission until
the last delivery two 'days later.
"In one case, N a letter mailed at
Fourth and Market streets on a Mon
day evening at 7 o'clock did not reach
the person addressed, 'on Folsom and
Twenty-third streets, until the follow
ing. Wednesday afternoon.
"In' another instance, manuscript
mailed by us to printers on Tuesday
evening did\ not reach them until the
following Thursday afternoon."
Several letter-carriers, when their at
tention was called to the delinquency,
said that complaints have been numer
ous, for months and have welcomed
news that complaints would be made
to the department. The inspectors and
the new Postmaster will take the mat
ter ud at once. â¢
GREAT DELAY IX DELIVERY.
An instance of the delay. in the city.
delivery -.of mail is shown by the state
ment made yesterday by the manager
of a well-known publishing firm In*
San Francisco. ' In speaking of the
matter he said:
Superintendent of City Ttelivery Cox
saj-s that there Is nothing in the com
plaints of carriers as to the cause of
the delay in mail delivery, and when
asked regarding this aspect of the mat
ter he treated it lishtly.
It is said that Postmaster Fisk pro
poses to make a thorough investigation
of the complaints and that .Superin
tendent of City Delivery Cox may be
disrated to a subordinate position if It
is found that he is â¢ responsible for the
delay In the delivery of mail.
It has also been stated on good au
thority that Postmaster Fisk and the
local postal inspectors will request the
Government to Increase the force of the
Postcfflce in San Francisco by twenty
five or thirty, extra men â this for the
purpose of giving, better. service to the
resident sections. of the city. .
Postmaster Fisk will have a task dur
ing his first few weeks in office
straightening out the tangle into which
the # free delivery service has become
involved. Hundreds of complaints from
residents.of the Mission, the Western
Addition and all outlying districts of
the city have been accumulating dur
ing the last three months, and no sys
tematic attempt to investigate them ap
parently has been made.
This deplorable state of affairs has
existed ever since the removal of J. W.
Erwin, who had general supervision of
free delivery on this coast. Erwin's
place has not been filled from Wash
ington, but his former duties have been
looked after by one of City Superin
tendent A. M.. Cox's assistants.
But there is a very great difference.
The postal . inspectors under Erwin's
direction were .prompt to investigate
complaints of./ slow delivery of mail
and suggest remedies. Since Erwin's
retirement, however, the ' complaints,
instead of being turned over to in
spectors to be investigated, have been
allowed to pile up. â¢ The result has
been a vast accumulation of com
plaints, while the inspectors are hav
ing an easy time and the suffering
public is compelled to endure the in
convenience of a poor service.
The carriers admit that many of
the complaints are Justified, but claim
they are overworked and that addi
tional help should be provided. The
inspectors agree that more carriers
are needed and it is probable that
some action to relieve the present un
satisfactory conditions will be taken
soon.
The unanimity with which the meni
have acted has surprised the contpany.
The submissive manner in which the
steel workers have accepted all the
changes led the superintendents to be
lieve that all they had to do was to
announce the wages that the company
Is willing to pay, and the men would
resume work. But the workmen are
prosperous. They have had steady
work during the last four years at good
wages and can afford to remain idle
several months without requiring as
sistance.
The trouble was started at the forty
inch mills in Homestead when three
crews, numbering about 450 men.
stopped work on Saturday. The crews
of every other mill held .meetings and
sent committees to A. R. Hunt with
counter-propositions and advised him
that the company's wages would not
be accepted. Heaters and rollers who
have been paid $2 72 for every one
hundred tons In the big: mills, have
been cut to $1 74. The men agree to
accept a reduction to $2 for every ona
hundred tons.
PITTSBURGH Pa.. Jan- 3.âIndica
tions point to a- metal strike at the
Homestead mills of the Carnegie Steel
Company. The men are not organized,
but they have suddenly assumed an
organized form within the plant and
committees have been appointed to is
sue an ultimatum to the company.
A. R. Hunt, the superintendent has
received five days* notice to meet the
scale of wages formulated by the ton
nage men. Unless a compromise 13
agreed upon, the Homestead plant will
be Idle.
Thera is no doubt that the strike will
extend to the Duquesne mills, the
Edgar Thompson plant in Braddock
and other plants controlled by the
Carnegie Steel Company. All employes
of the concern except some of the low
est wage earners have had their wages
reduced. Prom the railroad men up
to the head rollers everybody is dis
gruntled.

The Susan B. Anthony Club held a
public session in Golden Gate Hall on
Monday last, when Miss Gail Laughlin
addressed the assemblage upon "Child
Labor." Among the telling points made
by this logical speaker was that Cali
fornia stands convicted of the crime 'of
child laborâ that while a law stands on
our statute books forbidding children
under 12 to labor, the abuse goes stead
ily oa. Women of the civic clubs,
awaken to this slogan, "Away with
child labor!" If a man or woman puts
forth a child Into the vortex of the
world and cannot provide for its phys
ical necessities â letting alone the moral
â then It becomes the duty of the State
to take care of it and educate it, until
it is on a fair way to care for itself in
telligently. And the law has fixed this
age at 12. Herein lies the solution of
all our political and social problems,
and the only "intelligent solution.

In honor of Mrs. Payot. Mrs. C. J.
Wetmore wrote and sang to the music

Brown recited and Mrs. J. H. Ollmore,
In the costume of an old Aunt Saman

After this there was a general singing
of college songs and "Auld Lang Syne"
was sung with a swing that carried
with it the zest of good fellowship.
Now, I've not been informed whether
this was an all-day and all-night ses
sion, but from the quality and "quantity
of entertainment it would seem that
the members would have become men
tal dyspeptics. Such splendid material
would have provided good entertain
ment for three monthly sessions. It
seems a pity to pungle up such num
bers into a conglomerate mass, but for
those who could digest It all it was in
deed a feast for the gods. But wouldn't
It be better to distribute such good ma
terial over more time?

The California, the Forum, the
Corona, the Papyrus and the Press
clubs distinguished themselves at this,
the yuletide season.
. The California Club on Tuesday cele
brated Founders' Day. and it proved to
be well worthy of the noble women who
laid the foundation-stone of the great
est civic club in the West. The after
noon was under the guidance of Mrs.
Horace Coffin, and was carried out as
folio wp: Address on founders by Mrs.
J. J. Scoville; play by Miss Ruth Com
fort Mitchell, including the following
ladies in the cast: Mrs. Arthur Corn
wall. Miss Susanne Patch (the leading
part5>. Miss Laura Musto, Mrs. Horace
Coffin. Mrs. W. I. Marion. Mrs. Emil
Pohli. Miss Emilie Kalisher and Mrs.
Rodney Kendrick. Who that- had the
pood fortune to be present could forget
Mrs. Cornwall leaning for support,
mental, spiritual and financial, upon
her diminutive husband, little Susanne
Patch? O. it was funny, supremely
funny!
. And as for the toasts, they were dis
tinctly not the mortuary affairs that
unforturately we sometimes must
hearken unto. They were, every one of
them, full of intelligence, cleverness
ar.d wit. This welfare of the toasts was
<<>nfincd to the following ladles: Mrs.
Oeorge Law Smith, "Our Founders";
Mrs. Aaron Fchloss, "Our President";
Mrs. Hertz, "The Press"; Dr. Minerva
Kibbe. "Our Husbands"; Mrs. Madden,
"Th? Play and the Players"; Mrs.
"Music"; MrE. J.
â¢ W. Orr. "Ourselves."
In the presentation Mrs. Scoville and
Mrs. Bates especially distinguished
Themselves, each carrying the weary
burden of committee chairmanships. It
is sincerely to be hoped that the club
wijl offer again some similar enterprise
that will unveil to a gaping world what
r-lever c'.ubwomc-n can do. And their
"To the Clad New Tear" was the toast
of the clubs during the week, drunk in
bumpers of alluring: punch â almost in
noc<nt, the truth to tellâ of the stuff
that makes matutinal headacheF. But
It was good â very good, such as it was.
A fmart rivalry has sprung up between
The punch brewers of the Papyrus Club
and the California Club as to the rela
tive merits of each brew. It will, per
haps, require another test before a fair
decision can be rendered. But secretly,
I for one favor the Papyrus punch, be
cause the California Club unhappily
must dispense with any discernible
amount cf Kentucky brew, because the
ciub inhabits the building dedicated to
the T. M. C. A. But it would seem to
me that the women of the California
Club had arrived at the age of discre
tion â most of us â and could limit with
impunity the capacity of our in
â¢dulgence. But I am told that Mr. Mc-
Coy said "nay," and "nay" it was.
However, clubdom made merry dur
ing the week, and whether it was tea
.or toddy that toasted the day, the week
sva? a merry one and one not soon to be
forgotten.
ANNIVERSARY
IS CELEBRATED
Y..M.C.A. Does Not Per
mit Use of Liquor
in Punch.
The Corona Club held a red-letter ses
sion last week, at which the following
The Outdoor Art League had a most
delightful afternoon Monday, when J.
Frank Sullivan addressed the ladies on
"Parks." In his official capacity as
Park Commissioner Mr. Sullivan . Is
eminently able to elaborate upon the
question of parks, their necessity, their
care and their ethical value. This lec
ture is in logical sequence to the work
now in the hands of the California
Club, which has at the present moment
the task of finding a playground in the
North Beach district. This is a crying
need of the cityâ no one knows the
awful congestion existing in this part
of the city lest he has climbed the
Telegrapic steeps to know. In alleys
five feet wide a full company of urchins
could be mustered In ten minutes.
Where do they come from? Well, from
twists and turns and labyrinths that I
would fear to follow lest I'd never get
back. And these are the little ones who
need a breathing place, and "they need
it badly. This is a matter that the la
dies of the club must urge, and 1 urge
urgently.
That was a great day that the
Papj-rus Club offered its friends on
Thursday. What a pity that Mr.
Sweigert was the only man present
to offer an affidavit as to the legiti
macy of the stories thrust upon us
from the platform.
The stories of Mrs. W. S. Leake,
Mrs. Arthur Cornwall, Miss Jenne
Morrow Long, Mrs. Libby and Mrs.
Louise Battles Cooper are warranted
gilt edced.
Pardon me if I retail Mrs. Cooper's,
as it promises the merit of being brief,
which quality is a joy to a Journalist:
â¢'I met a woman friend the other day
whom I thoroughly dislike. I dislike
her on general principles, but when
she approached me. it being almost a
new year, I thought I would be mag
nanimous and I said, with an awful
wrench, 'Ah! how do you do, my dear?
Awfully glad to see you looking so
well. What a. stunning gown you are
wearing!' Drawing herself to a rather
formidable height, she said supercili
ously. Ind?ed! I am so glad you ad
mire my gown. Butâ unfortunatelyâ
I â cannot â say so much for yours.'
'O, really,' said I, 'perhaps you could
â if you could lie as readily as I can.' "
Now, that wasn't half bad, was it?
And a woman's story, too. The fol
lowing programme was admirably
rendered:
Thursday, December 31'. 1903. Programme
In charge of Mlns E'.la. jV. McCloskey. Pro
gramme: Press Club Quartet â (a) "Annie Lau
rie" (Dudley Buck), (b) "Simple Simon" (La

Flynn. Mrs. W. W. Briggs. Miss E. V. Mc-
Closkey. Mrs. Blanch Arnold, accompanist Mrs.
Helen Earl Sutherland. The Papyrus Club ex
tents a. "Happy Sew Tear" to its guests.
Miss Caro Roma's tale was a clever
inspection of the heart of a poor old
chap whose wife preferred an actor
man to him and who for fifteen years
kept the candle burning in the window
so she should "know that she was al
ways welcome in the home that still
was hers." Alas! that these fine, for
giving Christian husbands are so scarce
in the real drama of life. When a poor,
weak, silly little wife- wanders away
from the hearthstone she is seldom
welcomed back. Is the reverse condi
tion true, however? Just watch out a
little and see. But 'tis a woman's way
to forgive.
The programme of the day was in
charge of Miss Ella V. McCloskey, Mrs.
S. Mason Kinne, the worthy president,
being relegated for the hour to the
stiff-backed throne on the right of the
hall. Many stunningly gowned women
were noticed at this annual reception,
amongr whom were Mrs. Thomas Morf
few, Mrs. Hoshland, Mrs. S.-P. Blumen
berg, Miss Ella McCloskey, Mrs. W. P.
Buckingham, Mrs. W. S. Leake, Mme.
Seminario, Mrs. Cornwall and hosts of
others who consider artistic gowning
quite as Important a duty as that of
being mentally clever. \
Mrs. Frank J. Donnelly, who render
ed in fine style contralto solos in the
various wards: Miss Wright, who con
tributed a violin solo, and Mr. J. John
son, an organ obligato. while twelve
choir boys from the Good Samaritan
Mission, under Mrs. Brown, rendered
Christmas carols.
Mrs. Arthur Cornwall, Mrs. Geo. E.
Bates, Mrs. Schell. Mrs. James G. Mar
tin, Mrs. Kate S. Hart, Mrs. E. B.
Grace. Miss Sadie Wafer, Mrs. Frank
T. Shen. Mrs. Oatman, Mrs. Rodney
Kendrick, Miss Dora Dewing, Mrs. J.
G. Lemmon of Oakland, Miss Alice
Washburn. Mrs. G. W. Gear, Miss Jane
Van Winkle. Miss Carrie Wiggins, -Miss
Xatalie Bowman, Mrs. Lorin Barnes,
Miss Sadie Ray and Mrs. E. C. Monson,
the latter the chief of the forces. Mrs.
Monson as chairman of the hospital
section is perhaps more closely in
touch with these unfortunate wards
of the people than any other woman,
with the possible exception _of Miss
Wiggins and Mrs. Hart, who visit the
hospital weekly, bringing gaskets of
such things as the friendless sick
crave. Jellies, magazines, wines and
other things that we all appreciate
when we're ill will be gratefully re
ceived by the hospital section of the
California Club at its clubrooms in
the Y. M. C. A, building.
This enterprising club (the California)
gave a reception to the inmates of the
City and County Hospital on Wednes
day last under the auspices of the so
cial science department, Mrs. Jacob
Brandt chairman. Tobacco, pipes, ice
cream, candy and toilet accessories
were distributed to the sufferers by the
women of the club and their assistants,
and if the "God bless yous" don't waft
us into empyreal realms when we die
then there's small efficacy in prayer,
for everj' one of us was blessed, either
audibly or silently. How do I know? I
heard the former and I felt the latter.
They were spoken with a smile that
had but one interpretation, and that
was gratitude. The following ladies
lent their aid in making the affair a
success: *
claims as to their ability to recognize
a ioke when they hear one then will be
abundantly verified.

A very pretty domino party was
given on New Year's night at the resi
dence of Miss Roslne d'Ennery, 139G
Post street, by one of her dancing
classes. The hall was decorated with
many pink paper ribbon streamers,
which hung from the walls to the great
mass . of greens and mistletoe on the
chandeliers in the center. One of the
many pretty sights was while the
yourtg folks were dancing Miss d'En

d'Ennery, threw great streamers of this
ribbon across the hall over the heads
of the dancers, making the halt one

DEAR SIR:
This is to express to you the appreciation that the State
Board of Trade has of the work that has been and is being done by
The Call in the direction of encouraging settlement in this
State. I speak with some knowledge, at least with the experi
ence of a good many years, when I say that I regard the immigra
tion work done through The Call as the most effective that has
been done through any newspaper in the State in my recollection.
The immigration page, if I may so term it, has character, dignity
and merit, and certainly from the favorable reports that come
to me I am entitled to think is accomplishing much good.
Besides this the editorial comments of The Call are' most
effeotive, and, bearing as they do, the force of a large comner.
cial daily must be regarded as the very essence of good work,
yours very truly, â¢ - t V A

this large task the company purposes

The Sacramento. Bee says: "The
Board of Trustees has secured an op
tion on the entire property of the North
Fork Ditch Company, which takes wa
ter from the fork of the river opposite
Auburn and at present supplies the
country as far down as Orangeville and
Fair Oaks with water for domestic use
and irrigation. The intent is to recom
mend to the incoming board the sub
mission to the people of the plan of fur
nishing the city with water, from this
source and incidentally obtaining suf
ficient power to run the city lights." The
city undoubtedly needs badly, and
should have at cnee, clear, pure water
and the only available sources which
now receive serious consideration are
the North Fork and the Sacramento
River." "
The Richmond Record says that a
manufacturing concern from Puget
Sound has visited Richmond to secure
a site for the location of a factory for
agricultural implements.
"Florida oranges have b'cen early and
plentiful in the Eastern markets this
year, but Florida cannot profitably pro
duce the superior naval oranges, which

the yield of Placer County oranges has
been full this season and they are of su
perior quality. The Representative
says: "The orchards of J. Parker
Whitney shipped over one million
oranges this season, and forwarded its
last carload from Rocklin on December
8, Â¦ on order from Chicago, and have
shipped car'oads to the latter city, Cin

miles north from Hanford.
The Riverside Enterprise says that
shipments of oranges from Riverside
this year are remarkably slow. "This
is owing to the lack of rain and the
backwardness of the crop. There were
but fifty-nine cars sent out up to the
close of last week, with thirty-nine
cars of lemons, about one-fifth of last
year to that date. This -will make a
marked difference in the amount to
be shipped late, as the crop Is expect

The fle'd of its immense resources
has only yet been scratched over, but
whether these industries will be devel
oped in the . near future or in years to
come will depend greatly on .the in
crease of population and the labor mar
ket. T .t is well known that large man
ufacturing industries depend for their
profits on large productions, frequent
ly margin of profit is a very
small per cent of the. cost of the manu
factured article. Here labor is a large
factor in the industry.
A raise or /all in wages makes a
large difference to the manufi-cturer.
We can produce a great many articles
which we now import from other coun
tries, but we cannot dispose of them
at a profit on account of the difference
in wages. Living is as cheap in Cali
fornia as in most parts of the civilized
world. Laborers can work- here all the
year round , which > cannot â¢ be done In
other parts of the world. Therefore, the
laborer can, if he use thrift and frugal
ity, which unfortunately for him Is not
always the case, save more in Califor
nia than elsewhere.
Our laborers have the : facilities and
â¢generally profit by them of procuring
homes for their families /jy thÂ» pay
ment of small monthly installments
through the home building . and loan
societies. These institutions, when
properly and honestly . managed, ~ have
been pronounced. to be the best finan
cial Institutions for, wage earners ever
invented by man. They have already
helped many thousands of laborers to
procure homes for their families, and
the" young man, be he (laborer, clerk or
mechanic, .who has.put a part" of his

Asbestos rock for wall. plaster and
fire proofing columns in buildings and
fire-proof floors is a very valuable ac
quisition for our new fine buildings.
It Is light in weight and grayish in
its natural color. The long fibers are
also used to make asbestos steam pipe
covering. It can be used on the out
side of buildings by adding one part
of Portland cement and two part^ of
asbestos plaster. It becomes as hard
as marble.
An interesting test of this new fire
proof wall plaster was recently made
in the presence of Chief Engineer D.
T. Sullivan of the San Francisco Fire
Department, Captain Comstock of the
Underwriters' Patrol, representatives
of the Board of Underwriters and
many of the prominent architects and
builders of this city. The ordinary
Wall plaster was found to burn in flve v
minutes, while the new asbestos plas
ter continued to withstand the fire.
After fifteen minutes water was turned
on and the wall found to be intact.
This article, if found in sufficient
quantities, may revolutionize our
building materials and materially re
duce fire Insurance. It will also prove
a valuable protection tO;llfe in theaters
and public hotels and buildings.
Many new industries and products
are yet in their infancy in this State.
While we produce a large quantity
of olives and can produce sufficient to
supply the world, still that industry
is not yet on a paying basis generally.
Olives are grown in that part of the
world where labor is cheap. Most of
the picking is done by women and
children and, consequently, olive oil
can be imported to-day into California
much cheaper than it can be produced
here, but as the State becomes more
densely populated and the 'women and
children of the farmers will find enjoy
ment in the healthy exercise' of pick
ing olives, then we will be able to
compete in prices, as we do compete
in quality, and make this industry a
very profitable one to our farmers.
There is another Industry which has
passed the experimental stage." 'Â¦ It
has been demonstrated that silk worms
can be raised and the raw silk pro
duced in California more advantage
ously than in other parts of the world,
as the State is practically exempt
from the storms in the spring which
frequently kill the worms in Europe.
This industry requires cheap labor! ,
The raw material is now Imported
from China, Japan and Italy and the
American people pay every year fifty
million dollars to those countries for
raV silk. This is a work which occu
pies about sixty days in the'spring
time when the farmer has little to do'
If families of men. women and chil
dren would -congregate as they do in
Europe and feed the , little . growing
silk worms, they would find this a very
profitable industry.., In Europe farm
ers depend upon it for 'their pocket
money, many families' earning:, during
'80s. Since gasoline came into use this
manuf: :ture has increased rapidly, un
til now engines of this class, made in
California, have the highest reputation,
being supplied to 'all Pacific Ocean
countries and even to some countries
of Europe.
Leather tanning had a beginning in
the parly '50s at Santa Cruz. There be
ing no lumber available at that point,
tanning vats were constructed by fell
ing some of the big trees in that locality
, and scooping them out for use as vats,
i To-day we have some of the best
[equipped tanneries in the world with a
value in products ranging from ten to
twelve million dollars. The California
oak-tanned leather is famous for. Its
high superiority in strength and wear
ing qualities.
Portland cement, of which so many
millions of barrels have been imported
from Europe, is now supplied in this
State of as good, if not superior, quality
to that imported.
One recent discovery which may be
come of great importance to the State
has been that made of an asbestos
mine located at Copperopolis in Cala
veras County.
Our clo,thing manufacturers, who be
gan to work on a small scale in 1865, are
now producing most of - the material
used in the State, thus giving work to
thousands of deserving girls and
women.
Cordage manufacturing was one of
the earliest industries, having been es
tablished in 1856. Its equipment â¢ now
includes one of the two largest cable
machines In the world, and its product
commands a large home and foreign
market
Gas engine* began to be built in the
world and, by the genius of the Cali
fornian, John Forsythe,- the seeds are
removed to the pleasure and happiness
of the housewife. .
California is the largest shipping
point on earth for salmon.
Even seeds have assumed such an im
portance that they are supplied all over
the United States and return the grow
ers over $3,000,000 per annum.
Baking powder was one of the most
difficult articles to introduce . in Cali
fornia. All the early settlers from the
East had been accustomed to -use the
Preston & Merrill brand and when Mr.
Donnelly first introduced his California
baking powder, although it wa& supe-'
rior and a pure article, housewives re
fused to use it because they did not
know its good qualities. To-day the
great baking powder manufacturing
establishments of Schilling, Foiger and
Tlllmann & Bendel ship large quanti
ties of the article throughout the
United States.
MANUFACTURES OF STATE.
In manufactures we have been a lit
tle slower In making progress. The
cost of steam was formerly against us,
but now fuel oil and water power put
us on a level with the world.
The first boots and shoes were made
in a small factory employing hand la
bor in 1860. There are now over thirty
factories In the State, operated mostly
by modern machinery.
The old Wells, Fargo & Co. building
on the corner of California and Mont
gomery streets and several other of our
oldest buildings, erected in the early
'50s, used granite brought from China.
The old postoffice building contained
granite brought from Quincy, Mass.
Large granite quarries are now devel
oping in several parts of the State and
furnish proper material for the most
modern buildings. Roofing slate is now
also furnished from quarries in the
State.
The manufacture of rubber hose, belt
ing and molded goods from rubber
prepared in the East began in San
Francisco about eighteen years ago. Its
manufacture from crude rubber, Im
ported at San Francisco from South
America and India, began about eight
years ago. These goods are now shipped
to the East in carload lots.
Shipbuilding on the Pacific coast
dates back to the time of Cortez, who
established a shipyard at Zacatula on
the west coast of Mexico In 1524. Later
he built ships at Tehuantepec and at
Acapulco to push northward for greater
discoveries. From that tims en,-com
mercial, warlike and other causes have
led to the building of ships and boats
of wood along the coast of California
and about Puget Sound. :Â¦['/';
As early as 1850 nine coasting schoon
ers were built in a yard at North Bexch.
The f.:st ocean steamer was turned out
at San rrancisco in 1864. The manufac
ture of iron ships on a commercial scale
was not attempted until April, 1883. To
day shipbuilding is one of the great
manufacturing Industrie of the State,
employing thousands of wage-earners
in over forty ship-building establish
ments. Every condition of ship build
ing required by the Government and by
the merchant marine can now be met
here. Our Olympic and Oregon have
proven that we "can build aa good fight
ing -*'ns as are built in tr ..-orld.
The manufacture of trunks, valises,
etc., was establish^ ! in San Francisco
thirty-six years ago. Its products now
embrace every kind of trunks, valises,
handbags, etc., and are supplied to the
Pacific States and export trade.
OTHER ENTERPRISES.
; ' Our wines are now greatly appre
ciated, not only by our own people, but
are highly prized by connoisseurs in
England, Germany and all parts of the
. world. California in 1902 produced over
40,000,000 gallons of wine, valued at
over $12,000,000. This State is the only
one in the Union where the true wine
grape grows to perfection and, there
fore, we can produce here as fine wines
as are produced in any part of the
world. So far, Americans are not wine
drinking people. They only use one
half gallon- per capita per annum, as
against fifty gallons consumed by all
men, women and children In Italy,
France and Spain, and In these wine
* -producing countries intoxicated persons
â¢are seldom seen.
When the American people shall ac
quire the habit of using wines at table
â¢and consume, say, ten gallons per cap
ita, then this State will be able to sup
ply the demand by producing 1,000.000,
000 gallons of wine, which will have an
approximate value of $300,000,000.
Our fruits, both fresh, canned and
dried, are exported to ail parts of the
Klbbe, and the low prices'at which they
* can be furnished to consumers bring
them withJo the reach of the poor as
" well as the rich.
Our citrus fruits have replaced the
imported, and we can raise sufficient to
supply not only the inhabitants of our
* own country, but also many other parts
of the world. Most people will be sur
prised to know that recently several
hundred boxes of navel oranges were
shipped from California to Italy by or
der of the government of the famous
citrus fruit-producing country of Italy.
Prunes, which we used to receive In
large hogsheads from Germany and
Prance, arriving: generally in a moldy
condition, are now produced here, and
are shipped back to these countries in
fancy boxes, which arriving in splendid
condition, command the highest praise
. from consumers.
The raisins which we used to receive
from Spain are now raised in this State
In sufficient Quantities to supply the
.â¢ Arriving in San Francisco in the
â¢early fifties, it was indeed very inter
' esting to me, as it must have been to
Â¦ all early comers, to see, one by one.
â¢ the articles of product from the soil
and manufacture from raw material
. replacing those formerly imported
.'from all parts of the world. Well do
â¢ I remember how the first flour pro
duced from the Lick mills at Alviso
replaced the musty fiour imported
'. from Chile and New York via Cape
Horn and sold as high as from $20 to
*.$40 f>er barrel.
Sugar arrived from New York usual
. ' ly In a sweated condition, which caused
much complaint by ,the dealers, yet it
. -brought from 25 to SO cents per pound.
*â¢' I was then in the grocery commission
.. business, supplying the mines with all
â¢ kinds of provisions. I remember how
difficult it was to introduce a new Cali
fornia product or manufactured article
on the market. People had been so
long accustomed to the imported goods
that they had then, as, unfortunately,
some few people have now, a preju
dice against our own home-made arti
cles, although in most Instances every
thing that we produce or manufacture
*is far superior to that from abroad.
PIJtUe by little many of the Imported
articles were driven out of the market.
Who could have foreseen that in less
Â« than fifty years the tables would be
turned and that we would ship in enorr
taoua quantities back to the countries
from which we originally obtained our
supplies those very things that we had
â¢ lately been importing from them? Cali
fornia flour may now be found in all
parts of the fflobe: our sugar is sup
plying all the other States west of the
' Rocky Mountains.
"_ â¢ â¢ CAN SUPPLY THE WORLD.
â¢ : All of this was followed by a devel
opment which has not had its equal
' upon any other spot in the world in
rapidity of growth, in accomplished
results and in great future promise.
California is not only self-supporting
in numerous manufactured as well as
'. natural products, but it exports many
â¢ of its manufactures and it stands as
â¢ -"one of the great factors of the toun
.tries of the globe in the supply of ar
ticles of food to the people of the
. aorld.
DEVELOI'MEXT FOLLOWS.
The needs of the newcomers re
quired to be supplied from the out
side. For a time it occurred to no one
to make or grow anything. The only
thought of all was to dig: out gold and
( then to return to the good things of
civilization. In due time, however,
the most imperative needs of manu
facture on the spot began to assert
â¢themselves. First, perhaps, was lum
ber for shelter and for mining pur
poses. Gradually other much needed
manufactures followed in rough form
and the possibilities of natural pro
duction began to force themselves to
the notice of those who had time to
consider them.
With all of its productive capabili
ties, the State could not in its early
days furnish those who came in
search of gold the things which were
necessary' to satisfy their most ordi
nary wants. With many thousands of
cattle ranging the great Spanish
ranchos, butter in firkins must be
.brought from the East, as well as
hams and bacon, and dried apples
hung on strings and then packed in
barrels according to the old way.
We need go back less than fifty
years to find the beginnings of manu
facturing in California and it is need
less to say that these beginnings were
â¢generally of the crudest character.
Until the discovery of gold the only
â¢ productions of consequence that
reached the outside world were hides
and tallow.

Work of Development
Goes on Without
Any Pause.
The several pages that have been re
cently published in The Call, on suc
cessive Monday mornings, devoted es
pecially to enlightenment concerning
the actual icsources of California, have
been very favorably received through
out the State. Thousands of copies of
the Monday issue of The Call have
been sent, through the agency of the
California State Board of Trade and
otherwise, to inquirers in the East con
cerning California. On each page of
the series devoted to development is
one or more signed articles written by
m*n who have expert knowledge of the
topics treated of by them. This morr.ing
an exceedingly interesting and valua
ble article is supplied by Andrea
Sbarboro, president of the Manufac
turers* and Producers" Association of
California.
Mr. Sbarboro traces the origin of
some California industries, tells of
their advancement and makes some
forecast of the future of California in
dustrially. Among the new industries
of the State mentioned by him are the
mining of asbestos, a deposit having
been discovered near Copperopolis; and
the culture of silk worms on a large
scale. It is well known that a Gov
ernment expert interested Mr. Sbar
boro in the silk industry and he has
made a thorough study of the propo
sition. The raw material now Import
ed from the Orient and from Italy, MrÂ»
Sbarboro says, costs the people of the
United States $50,000,000 per annum.
"Silkworms can be raised and the raw
silk produced in California more ad
vantageously than in other parts of
the world, as the State is practically
exempt from the storms in the spring,
which frequently kill the worms in
Europe."
OXLY SCRATCHED OVER.
Mr. Sbarboro. speaking from a point
of vantage, being entirely acquainted
with the resources and manufacturing
possibilities of California, remarks
that "the field of immense resources
has been only yet scratched over; but
whether these industries will be de
veloped in the near future or in years
to come, will depend greatly on the
increase of population and the labor
market." .
Some space is given, this morning, to
statements derived from, special edi
tions of paners published in this State
relative to the communities where they
are established. The purpose of The
Call Is to assist in promoting the wel
fare of all portions of California. In
spreading the information derived
from special editions of contempora
ries published in various portions of
the State, aid is afforded to the enter
prise of interior and coast counties,
which are thereby enabled to supply
their own facts to the appreciative
readers of The Call at home and
abroad.
Attention has recently been devoted
to the' efforts of the Sacramento Valley
Development Association to secure ac
curate knowledge concerning all the
counties in the Sacramento Valley. The
work In that direction is systematically
devised. The State Board of Trade is
seeking to get definite Information con
cerning all sections of California. The
following preambles and resolutions
were adopted at a late meeting of the
Board, which are here given for gen
eral information and encouragement:
"Whereas, It is the belief of this
Board that there are many partially
developed resources of this State which
are retarded in their growth by lack
of knowledge of the lest methods of
production and of markets awaiting
their output; and,
"Whereas, There are many industries
not yet entered upon which, in our
belief, might be engaged in with profit,
to the Individual and to the enlarge
ment of the State's resources; there
fore,
"Resolved. That the Committee on
Industrial Resources be directed to In
vestigate and report ujon the matter
the subject of this resolution.
POPULATION'S GROWTH.
"Whereas, It is deemed of importance
to ascertain to what extent California
has increased in population during the
decade ending in 1900 and since that
time so far as practicable, and to deter
mine the proportion of this Increase
which has settled in the towns or cities
and in the countr> respectively; also
the regions of the State, by counties,
where the Increase has occurred and
the causes that have led to the choice
of location made by this new popula
tion; also to ascertain the principal in
ducements that have operated and are
operating to bring settlers into the
State; also what the causes are, If any
exist, why counties, possessing great
attractions for the homeseekcr, are not
receiving their share of immigration to
the State: therefore,
"Resolved. That the Committee on
Immigration be and it is directed to In
vestigate and report upon the matters
herein above referred to."
The hope is expressed by the direct
ors of the State Board of Trade that
the people of the State will co-operate
in supplying the solid Information that
is sought for beneficial use.

SUCCESS CROWNS THE CALLS EFFORTS
IN BEHALF OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Continued on Page 9, Column I, j
While McAdie was attempting to
install a working system of wireless
telegraphy ' between Point Reyes and
the Farallones, Admiral Glass was
laboring by similar methods to estab
lish a line between Goat Island and
Point Bonita. The Washington au
thorities were eagerly av.-ajting news
of the succesSvOf one or both.
The naval line never amounted to
much. Two masts were erected and
apparatus was installed. The operat
ors never. got so far as to communicate
at long distance without using the tel
ephone wires. Before the experiments
were endt-rt, however. Admiral Glasa
was ordered away. The Navy subse
quently requested that it be presented
with the" 1 "Farallones plant. The
Weather Bureau officials 1 refused to
listen and so McAdie was allowed to
continue his experiments.
The local system Is largely original
with Thiessen and McAdie. Both have
made Improvements on previous inven
tions.- Itis.toibe known by the cour
tesy *ot McAdie as the Thiessen system.

tion. â¢ The Weather Bureau officials
on the islands lived a life almost as
full of solitude as that of Alexander
Selkirk. They ate canned goods and
drank stale water. Their only recre
ation was work. The experts at Point
Reyes had almost as hard a time.
The apparatus appeart-d bound not to
be operated. Some delicate piece of.
electrical machinery seemed always
lost or broken. The work was dis
couraging In the extreme.
Genius and persistency finally won
the victory. The Weather Burea\Â» has
a cable from Point Reyes to the Faral
lones and this enabled the ex
perimenters to comunicate with
each other ' while 'â¢ laboring on
their wireless . telegraph system.
Without the cables the successful in
stallation of the plant could probably
never have been accompyshed.
Jt was desired that the whole matter
be kept secret, partly that foreign na
tions might not get too much informa
tion of our progress with the new dis
covery, partly that there might be no
interference from the other depart
ments of Government of the United
States.
. The inventors hope to have apparatus
installed on some* of San Francisco's
The great point of superiority in Mc-
Adie's apparatus is the receiver. Aside
from the fact that this system is the
first to be used at the port of San
Francisco, the success attained is of
great Importance by reason of Its be
ing effective, economical and on a prac
tical basis. Most of the previous suc
cessful experiments with wireless teleg
raphy have been extretaely expensive.
It was fea?ed that the discovery could
hardly become of use generally.
McAdie has made it possible to tele
graph without wires at what will be a
comparatively cheap rate. The re
ceiver is a delicate and effective instru
ment, which costs approximately 8
cents. It is made of emery dust and
mercury- Heretofore these instruments
have been very expensive. At present,
the receiver will not last for more than
three or four days. It is McAdle's be
lief that he or Thiessen will improve
upon it.
The greatest difficulty previously en
countered by experimenters with wire
less telegraphy was to make the appa
ratus work in all kinds of weather.
Fog, rain,, heat nor cold have any ef
fect on McAdie's line. It has been
worked all through the month of De
cember without any serious hitches.
The greatest trouble ha? been in
keeping the vital portions of the appa
ratus dry. Both McAdie and Thiessen
have schemes for Improving their sys
tem. Neither seems to hope for per
sonal aggrandizement as a . result of
his great success and eacn tries to pass
the glory up to Secretary of Agricul

The Marconi and the De Forrest syÂ»

Tt is alleged that the experts of vari
ous nations have made much progress
with wireless telegraphy in the last
few months, but results as well aa
methods are being kept secret. The
reason for this Is that a wireless sys
tem which works perfectly will be of;
Infinitely more value to a fleet of war
vessels than whole cargoes of torpe
does.
The plant was not put In operation
without great trouble. Something Was
always happening to make experiments
unsuccessful. Two men had to be con
stantly at the Farallones and some
times they were forced to go hungry
because the difficulties of transporta
tion were so great. Boats could not
sail according to, schedule on account
of stormy weather. Crews sometimes
failed to make a landing on the islands
when the boats reached their destlna-
HARDSHIPS ARE GREAT.
ncials Thomas and Hobbs have also
been engaged In the work.
McAdie has been studying wireless
telegraphy for several years. It is
nearly three years ago when high Gov
ernment officials first began to regard
him as something of -an authority in
these matters. When Secretary of Ag
riculture Wilson visited San Francisco
in May, 1901, with the late President
McKinley, McAdie took him to the top
of Mount Tamalpais and Is supposed to
have held a consultation there with
him on the subject of wireless teleg
raphy. At any rate Secretary Wilson
has encouraged the local official in his
work and together with Chief Moore
of the Weather Bureau has seen that
the funds necessary to conduct the ex
periments have been forthcoming. In
July, 1901, Professor McAdie' com
menced work on his present scheme of
wireless telegraphy. Many men have
been laboring for several months to
make the plan successful. The results
justify the expectations of McAdie and
his helpers.

So successful has been the experiment,
however, that it is expected an appro
priation can be secured to continue the
Â¦ work-

romantic history of the madame:
"She left Berne as a girl with her
uncle, whose skill as a modeler In wax
of portraits and- anatomical subjects
was such that the Prince dÂ© Contl In
duced him to settle in Paris and aban
don the profession of medicine. There
Mile. Grosholtz (the name of Madame
Tussaud before her marriage) became
even more sought after than her rela
tive. At his table she met the great
men of her time; Voltaire and Rous
seau, Franklin, Mirabeau. Necker and
La Favette sat to her for their por
traits in wax. The interest of her me
moirs, published in 1S38. lies in the
fact that friend and confidante as she
was of the royal house, she came into
contact with many whose doings make
up the history of the fall of Louis XVI.
Owing to h?r connection with the royal
house of France she was Imprisoned
during the revolution, and had aa her
fellow captive the luckless Mme. da
Beauharnals. who lived to ba the Em
press" Josephine. Among her earliest
experiences was the modeling of the
heads of prominent victims of the Ter
ror, some of them fresh from the guil
lotine; and it was only by the fall of
Robespierre, whose portrait, like that
of Voltaire, still remains in the show
as originally fashioned by Mme. Tus
saud, that she was saved the fate of
some of her subjects.
Milk in Bricks.
The inventors of a methojj by which
milk is now being solidified on a con
siderable scale confidently believe that
their discovery will rot "only abolish
the many dangers of the dairy, but will
eventually do away with the daior
Itself. They are confident, that is, that
the day of liquid milk is over.
People* who have tried to solidify milk
before have employed too low a tem
perature In their fear of decomposing
its fats and sugars, and in consequence
have failed. But by the Just-Hatmaker
process the liquid milk Is whisked
round polished cylinders kept at a fierce
heat bv steam, and comes off in a few
seconds in the form of a continuous
creamy-while sheet five feet In width.
This is reduced to powder and may be
cornpressed into cakes.
The features of the product is that it
is still potentially milk â the whole milk
and nothing but the milk, and to make
new milk at any time it is only neces
sary to add the seven parts of water
which have been evaporated.
The result Is said to be difficult to
distinguish from fresh milkl Its cream
rises naturally, and it may be made
into butter* or cheese. The powder and
cakes "keep indefinitely, and v samples
have been sent round the world and
kept for three weeks in Shanghai, re
turning quite fresh. Obviously it is im
possible, to water, skim or adulterate
solid milk, and a fact to which the in
ventors attach extreme importance is
that all attempts to cultivate microbes
on it: have failed.

UNITED STATES SEXATOR
WHO CONDEMNS SELEC
TION OF PANAMA ROUTE.
WE scratch a match for our 'convenience in get
ting a light or a fire, and Without thought of
what , a match means. In this country we
scratchjrnatchcs .every year that v require four billion feet
of pine lumber in their manufacture. That represents
400 acres of virgin pine forest. If the consumption of
matches remained as now, without increase, the boy just
born will by the end of his three score years have seen
the destruction of 24,000 acres of pine for the manufac
ture of matches alone.
The railroads consume ninety million ties annually in
renewal of their substructures, which means' the annual
destruction of three billion feet of timber. The telegraph
poles required annually amount to 750,000. Ths
demand for ties and poles strips annually 100,000 acres
of timber. The demand for shoe pegs uses up yearly
3000 acres of hardwood, and lasts and boot trees require
the use of a half million cords more. Wood pulp for
paper takes yearly 80,000 acres of-timber. All of these
uses are minor demands upon the forest. High above
them is the demand for building lumber, dimension tim
ber, furniture and ship-building. The rapid destruction of
the forest far outruns replanting. The efforts of nature
to renew the forest are thwarted by annual fires, which
not only destroy the young growth, but join the match
and shoe maker, the railroads and telegraphs and the
pulp mills in destroying the old timber as well.
When American land-owners understand the profit
of planting, timber, and are willing by that means to en
rich their heirs and their estates, every holding wilr be
in part devoted to a crop of trees. A farmer in^ndiana
fifty years ago planted white pine on part of his land.
He is now 68 years old, but finds that 100 acres planted
to white pine, 100 trees to the acre, is now worth
$30,000, putting the value of the lumber at only $10 per
thousand feet. In all the prairie States, and in the
deserts where irrigation is being introduced, and in the
valleys of California, eveYy land-holder may do better
than devoting all his land to annual crops by planting
parti of it to merchantable timber.
The man in "Indiana lived to >see his tree plantation
equal -an investment of S2000 running fifty years on 6
per cent interest compounded annually. He did not
have the $2000 in cash to invest, and if he had he could
not have invested it at 6 per cent compound interest on
security always safe. But he had the land and could
get trees for nothing out of the forest. Prudent men
resort to life insurance to safeguard their families, and
that is wise and well. But the prudent land-holder who
desires to do something for his children a,nd grand
children can beat both current rates of interest and life
insurance by planting trees of the kinds that have com
mercial value. *
By devoting part of his land to'a tree crop he 'does
more than appears on the . financial side of the matter.
He'enriches the landscape, affords shelter for the birds
which destroy the insect enemies "of his crops, and he
increases the fertility of the rest of his land for annual
crops by increasing the moisture. It is a^ matter of ob
servation* that ""rreerplanting in Nebraska has extended
the tillable frontier of that State westward at the rate
of about three miles a year. On our deserts a great ally
of irrigation' will be found to be tree-planting.
If it be where only the cottonwood will grow, dense
"plantations of that tree will by' and by be sought by the

THE USES OF TIMBER.

Rica: Orranlzer of U. S. Rubber Company,

(Copyright, 19CH, by Joseph B.. Bowles.)
A canal between the Atlantic and the
Pacific is the greatest project of the
century. It will undoubtedly benefit the
world at large, .but it will be of especial
advantage to the Latin-American re
publics, particularly Colombia and the
Central American -States, as the dis
tance saved by them will be proportion
ately greater than that saved by other
countries.
The opening of the caAal will mark
important changes in the International
trade. The wheat and other products
of the Pacific slope, which have hereto
fore been carried around Cape Horn, or
through the Straits of Magellan to Eu
rope, will then have to traverse less
than one-half the distance. Many arti
cles of merchandise can be placed in
markets where heretofore it has not
been possible for them to compete. For
example, although the lumber of Ore
gon is the lowest cost lumber in the
world, but little now comes to the At
lantic because of the long distance
around Cape Horn.
The question as to the relative cost
of the different canal routes can be
passed upon intelligently only by en
gineers after a thorough investiga
tion; general impressions of others,
who are often prejudiced by personal
interests, are of little value. We must
accept the report of the engineers who
made an exhaustive investigation aa
to the relative merits of the different
routes and who have reported In favor
o( Panama.
As to the title of the property re
quired for the construction of the can
al, it would appear that entirely satis
factory conditions are offered by the
government of Panama, which condi
tions are embodied in the Hay-Varilla
treaty.
Certainly if , the United States fur
nishes the cash necessary to build the
canal and give other nations the ben
efit of that construction at the . same
rates of toll as paid by its own ves
sels, it should have the most favorable
conditions possible to Justify the enor
mous outlay which will be necessary
for the successful completion of this
gigantic work.
In considering the relative .nerits of
the different routes, the question of
locks, the lengthâ Panama forty-nine
miles, Nicaragua 183 milesâ the fact
that the Nicaragua route would be the
shortest ' distance from the Atlantic
ports of the" United States to its Pa
cific ports, have all been taken into
consideration, and in view of the work
already done at ?an?.ma the engin
eers' estimates and all things consid
ered, I have no question but that the
Panama route is the best.
Another item to be considered is the
cost of maintenance of the canal, that
of Nicaragua being estimated at $3,
300,000 per annum and Panama at $2,
000,000, which difference of $1,300,000
capitalized at 2 per cent, about the
present rate of United States bond in-"
terest, would amount to $65,000,000^
A very important advantage to the
United States to be kept in mind in
considering the cost ' of the canal is
that which would obtain in case of war
by being able to transfer our war ves
sels and transports from one ocean to
the other. The importance of this was
brought home to us by the famous
voyage of the battleship Oregon. It
costs the United States to support its
navy $75,000,000 per annum. If its effi
ciency is increased ten per cent by the
facility of being able to transfer its
ships from one ocean to the other, it
woultL mean an advantage to us "of
$7,500,000 per annum, which, capitalized
at two per cent, would amount to $150,
000.000âmore than sufficient to com
plete the Panama canal.
The projected canal will prove a po
tent influence In the development of
Latin-America, and will tend to cement
intimate commercial, financial and. pck
litical relations between the Americas.

Santo Dorajngo is now in the happy possession and de
lightfully uncertain enjoyment of four full-fledged, ambi
tious war parties, each determined to do and die in the
sanguinary service of the gay goddess of liberty who
presides over its half of the little island. This condition
may safely be characterized as ideal. What a splendid
crop of dead patriots these four war parties ought to
produce as a preliminary to the restoration of peace for
decent citizens. ,.
Foes of Ocean Travel
In his article on the methods of de
stroying the half-sunken vessels that
float the ocean, in Harper's Magazine
for January, H. H. Lewis gives some
interesting information as to the num
ber of these ocean wanderers and their
rtmarkable voyages.
"The statistics collected so far state
that the average number of derelicts
annually sighted in the Atlantic is 232,',*
says Mr. Lewis. "The year 1S93 was ths
most prolific, 41S floating derelicts of.
every degree being reported to the bu
reau.
"Take the remarkable case of the
Fannie E. Woolston. Left by her crew
off the American coast in 1891, she
drifted tor three years and six days,
covering in that time more than 10.000
miles. In the course of her wandering
she followed the gulf stream over to
England, then took a jaunt down the
European coast, and finally, true, to* her
country, returned by devious ways over
the equator back to America, where she
was wrecked three degrees north of the
spat where she started adrift.
"The schooner .B. R. "Woodside. an
other famous derelict, began her career
several hundred miles east of Savan
nah. She started off toward Europe by
way of the gulf stream, changed her
mind when near the Canary Islands
and turned back to within twenty miles
of her starting point. Then she drifted
south to the islands of Florida, became
mixed up in a storm and went zigzag
ging acros3 the ocean. She crossed her
own path a number of times and was
sighted by forty different shipmasters,
who made haste to report her maneu
vers to the Hydrographic Bureau. Sha
was a particularly dangerous specimen
of the genus derelict, and there was
great relief in marine circles when it
was reported that some enterprising
craft had picked her up and towed her
to Abaco, New Providence.
"The honor of being the most remark
able derelict probably belongs to the
Fred B. Taylor, the craft that was run
into by the Trave in 1832. The sharp
bow of the trans-Atlantic liner cut the
sail Ins vessel squarely in half, and by
all rules of marine procedure should
have sent her to the bottom. Strange
to relate, however, the two parts re
mained afloat and each started off on
its own hook to become a member of
the profession of derelicts. The stern
was blown north and finally brought
up on Wells Beach, and the bow,
guided by an Inshore current, went
south and came to grief opposite the
Carolinas." , ":Z~ -":__
'A Bubble.
Jarr.es P. Treadwell spent his days
in a dank smelling elevator down on
Sansome street, tugging hour after hour
upon the shiny eld rope which acted as
the brake on the old-fashioned water
elevator. o-.v-- ;
His shoulders had .become rounded by
much tugginss on that self-same rope,
and the cheerless light of the shaft had
bleached his face to a prematurely old
shallowness.* But for each of the busi
ness men who stepped daily into his di
lapidated lift, James P., as he was fa
miliarly called, had a cheery nod and a
word! about the condition of stocks or
the price of such .and such a commodity
up for barter.
Through many years of pinching and
deprivation James P. had managed to
put aside from his niggardly monthly
pay enough to bring his account at the
bank barely into the four figures. Then
came^the Xome excitement. The head
of James P. grew light with the tales
of fortunes made in a minute, and these
precious four nsures In the bank were
transferred to his credit for stock pur
chased in the Yukon Gold Dredging and
Exploitation Company. According to
the glittering prospectus the wreciter
T. P. Whitelaw was to be fitted with
a gold dredging outfit and the gold
would be ripped from the bed of the
Yukon like shingles off a roof.
But one fatal morning James P. read
by the misty light in his elevator that
the T. P. Whitelaw had gone down off
Mendocino, j an absolute loss. "With a
sigh, almost a choke, James P. turned
and grasped again tlie shiny eld rope.
Morgan Favors Nicaragua.
BT V. S. SENATOR JOHN T. MORGAN,
/Copyright, 1904, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
I will state a few of "the reasons for
the faith that is in me" as to the great
superiority of the Nicaragua route and
the honest fear that almost everybody
has that the Panama route is impossi
ble as a practical route.
I have only been anxious to be right
in my votes as a Senator on these ques
tions, and that our country in working
out this great scheme, which no other
had visited "Washington to see Mr. Jef
ferson, who was then" President.
It is not remarkable that a letter
written by Thomas Jefferson should be
extant, for Mr. Jefferson wrote letters
by the thousand, and at a time, too.
when his fame would cause them to be
treasured, but it is remarkable that a
fragile sheet of paper could be kept for
so many years by a roving band of In
dians who had no other habitation than
bark huts. The letter was addressed
to the Poncas, Otoes, Iowas, Osagea,
Sacs. Foxes, Pottaxvatomies anfl Sioux
by President Jefferson. The Indiana
from whom Mr. Darman obtained it
seemed to have no knowledge of its im
port, but were keeping it among other
papers of little or no historic value.
Mr. Darman lived among the Indiana
and learned to talk their language flu
ently, and it was while he was living
among the Sacs that he found the let
ter. The fact that it is addressed to
the only inhabitants, at that time, of
Oklahoma gives additional Interest to
the letter.
T.HE year just closed was one of the most remark
able, commercially, that the country has ever had.
â¢It was a year of uninterrupted retrenchment and re
adjustment, of enormous liquidation, and yet this liquida
tion .was so skillfully met and managed by the controll
ing financial interests of the country that ,it was chiefly
confined to the stock market and only indirectly affected
general trade, and even then not seriously. But the ef
fect on the stock market was extremely severe. Values
of securities of all classes, industrial and railway, shrank
to such a degree that the shrinkage mounted far up into
the millions and was called "the rich man's panic." Vast
syndicates, floated with great eclat and hurrah a year or
/two previously, were so unmercifully investigated and
pruned by the banks that their assets, largely of a paper
character, declined enormously. A number were forced
out of business, others went to pieces of their own weight,
and others, notably the "shipbuilding and steel trusts, were
subjected to the rays of a financial searchlight that ex
posed a condition of affairs not at all complimentary to
their promoters and managers. And all this happened
without any commercial panic and its completion found
the country's trade on a safer and better basis than be
fore, with money abundant everywhereÂ«and the mercan
tile community- still optimistic and confident of the fu
ture. This is the condition of the country to-day.
If there is one feature more prominent than others at
present it is the abundance and ease of fundsl We passed
through the fall without any 'stringency worthy of the
name and the moving of the crops has thus far been ac
complished without any recourse to drastic measures to
relieve a tight monej' market. This was an agreeable
surprise all around, as a stringency had been apprehended
as far back as last spring. Never before has the country
been so well supplied with ready cash. The gold supply
in the United States Treasury a month ago was reported
above all previous records. Our foreign obligations have
been liquidated down to a small compass and our foreign
trade balance makes a favorable showing. Reductions
in quotations for iron and steel, provisions and sundry
other great necessary staples, have stimulated trade* in
these branches, which are reporting renewed activity in
the demand and at generally steadier prices. But as a
rule the tendency in prices " is still downward, as they
were too high for several years, and finally got beyond
the capacity of the public purse. There is a limit to the
purchasing power of the public as well as to that of the
individual, and that limit has been reached and in some
lines of trade overreached. A recession in these lines has
occured as a logical sequence.
There was little or nothing new in trade last week.
There never is during holiday week. The feature was
the announcement of sweeping reductions in wages by
several of the trusts to meet the smaller returns on the
capital caused by the great liquidation of 1903. This is
an unwelcome beginning of the new year to hundreds of
thousands of workmen, but'thus far the readjustment in
wages has not caused any serious labor troubles.
The staples show no marked changes and the few
notedare in the direction of stronger markets. . Wool
shows more tone, with increased buying by rnills/^The
sensational advance and subsequent reaction in cotton
have so unsettled this market that the mills are operating
with caution and keeping close inshore as far as pur
chasing raw material is concerned, j Hides are reported
steadier. Coffee is quoted firm and active. Lumber is
irregular, being quiet in some sections and moving off
freely in others. The grain markets of the country
showed little change until the close of the week, when
they were affected by Saturday's war scare. Wheat
promises to be an abundant crop all over the world and
up to Saturday the large consuming markets of Europe
refused to get excited over the threatened., war between
Russia and Japan. The Government estimates our cprn
crop at about 2.200,000,000 bushels, which imparts a feel
ing of confidence throughout the East and West.
With plenty of ready cash on hand and large crops of
wheat and corn to further increase the supply,"" with the
earnings of the railways larger than a year ago and ex
panded building operations already outlined for the com
ing spring, the outlook for trade in the United States
during the first six months of 1904 is certainly promising.
But there is not much expectation of higher prices for
general merchandise, nor of any pronounced increase in
mercantile activity.
As far as our local California conditions are con
cerned the prospects are optimistic. From all around us,
north and south, come advices of depleted supplies \ of
grain, hay and other forage, with intimations that
fornia may have to be drawn upon for supplies before
the crop year is over. This of course imparts a feeling
of confidence all over the State. Our wool, hops, hides,
canned and dried fruits have been bringing returns highly
satisfactory to the farmer'and orchardist; our real estate
I markets have been more active than for years back; our
chief city is growing enormously, and our banks, city and
country, report large supplies of money available for sol
vent borrowers at normal rates of interest; and the only
cloud on. the horizon to-day is the lack of rain in. the
southern part of the State, which is becoming a source
of apprehension in some quarters. The northern and
central parts have thus far had enough moisture for farm
ing and grazing qperations and no complaints of dry
â¢veather are heard from San Francisco northward. With
average rains from now on even the southern half of the
State will probably pull through all right.
OLD AND NEW TRADE YEAR.
people, under a providence that Is ias
peculiar to them as the founding of
the kingdom of Messiah was to the
seed of Abraham, that we should
lift up the western rite between
the oceans.
The wily Briton, sleepless in
vigilance and wise in forecast, saw
that^ we were preparing to cross
the sea with ships through dry land,
and she set hersi If across our path and
held us in check for fifty years. "What
we suffered in that period it is useless
now to recount. In the time of waiting
we grew so strong that open opposition
to us by force became too dangerous to
our ancient kinsmen, and Great Britain
retired apparently to gather the fruits
of rich harvests at Suez, which she had
captured by stealth, and she even be
came our friend. She has so fallen in
love with us Indeed that she gives us
encouragement in our raid on Colombia,
which is contra bonas mores, knowing
that Panama is a morass, in which our
strong limbs will flounder, and we will
sink like a mastodon mired in a quick
sand.
France essayed to rid herself of a
body of death that she had created to
take the honors that belonged to us,
but the Panama canal died' on her
hards, and France had been so long
chained to its cadaver that she is sup
plicatine us to relieve her of its pres
sure.
De Lesseps had been here and had
distributed great wealth among bank
ers and easy-going officials in high
places, who learned that the presence
of the agents of the Panama Canal
Company among us, old or new. was a
certain indication of "pay dirt."
These always "welcome universal
bankruptcy in markets and morals
when they are not caught in the fall,
and ifcey surrender at once and at dis
cretion. The seed planted by De Les
seDS. which cost him the recorded de
cree of a convicted felon, and is a bar
sinister on the escutcheon of one of the
world's foremost benefactors, still ger
minates among us, and our bank
ers and corruDtionists of hish and low
degree still dig around the deadly crop
in search of the pot of gold. If they
find it they are glorious and immune
from the stinging arrows of public
opinion, and that hope Justifies the ef
fort and condones the disgrace.
'A Pledge.
"Talk about New Year's resolutions,"
said an old miner at the Lick House
yesterday. "I shall never forget . one
that~was made in a camp down in Ari
zona a few years ago. New Year's eve
forty of us were jammed into Colorado-
Pete's. Pete "was as ugly a specimen
of frontier gin sllnger as I had ever run
across. Everything was whisky that
night. :-}y.9]
"Along about midnight a stranger
blew In. The boys eyed him, and one
of them called him over to join the
crowd. . He drank, once, twice, three
times, then- he turned on us and the
temperance sermon that fellow poured
out would- have made Neal Dow turn in
his grave.
"Before he cot through every moth
er's son of us had taken the pledge and
had drifted out. The stranger followed
a bunch of us. and he said:
" 'See here, boys" you can't keep that
pledge as long as this gin mill stands.
Let's pull It down.'
"Just .drunk enough to da anything.
we waited until Pete had shut the flim
sy door and put out the lights. It was
the only whisky shop In the camp. Our
stranger friend had disappeared. Sud
denly there was a terrific explosion, a
crash and 'Pete's* had been blown to
atoms. Pete went with the mess.
" 'To all of youâ Pete stole my wife
from me. I've settled accounts. Keep
your pledge.' "
"At daylight some of the boys found
the stranger's body near the creek that
ran alongside 'Pete's.' ' There "was a
bullet wound in the head, a pistol
grasped*in the right hand. And pinned
tq the ragged shirt front was this note:
to procure the construction of its great railroad invites
comparison with* the land-grant scheme which fostered
the completion of the Union Pacific in the sixties. When"
Congress decided to assist in the financing of* this rail
road it first granted to the : company every alternate
section of land for ten miles on each side of the track
and subsequently raised this bonus to cover every
twenty miles^on both sides of the rails. Moreover gold
bonds to the total value of $29,328,000, maturing in thirty
years. and bearing 6 per cent interest, were apportioned
out upon the completion of each twenty miles of roadway.
Through less pressing^need and the presence of more
available capital, the South Australian Government is
not moved to hold out such a lavish prize to hesitating
investors. ,The question of the Government ownership
of the proposed railroad is not yet settled. Further, the
blocks of land offered as grants must abut alternately
upon the one side and the other of the roadway.
It is safe to say that the public lands thus offered by
the antipodal Government to insure the development of
the vast interior of Australia have a potential value as
great as that of the undeveloped plains of our own great
West in the sixties. In a comprehensive pamphlet,
issued by the South Australian Government, the reports
of experts upon the resources of "the bush" are sej
forth. The northern' territory, which the projected sys
tem will traverse, has an area of 523.620 square miles,
nearfy five times that of Great Britain. ' For 1200. miles
it has a seacoast with harbors and navigable rivers. In
the virtually unexplored interior, though drought is suf
fered as in the^plateau States of our own country, the
conditions are favorable for artesian irrigation. The
whole interior contains gold, both placer and in the form
of quartz; but the difficulties of transportation have
made the mines practically worthiest. The very prom
ising agrarian and grazing resources have only recently
been exploited.
For the restless energy of capital the land-grant rail
road project and the development- of the interior which
will follow upon its completion should offer a profitable
vent." Certain it is that the opening of the heart of the
Australian continent will be the precursor of a new
epoch in the industrial life of all the states therein. The
great wealth hidden in the interior needs only the talis
man touch of the steel rails' to become revealed.

aid. Neither Thiessen nor myself ex
pect now or ever did expect to reap
any financial benefit from our labors.
We would be willing to let any one get
what advantage they might from our
Improvements, but the authorities at
Washington have directed us to take
out patents.
McAdie said yesterday: "The biggest
part of the credit for this achievement
belongs to Willis Moore. Chief of the
Weather Bureau and to Secretary Wil
son of the Department of Agriculture.
They provided the means for us and
If we have done anything it is due to
their labors in our behalf:
Particular stress is laid on the claim
that it Is more difficult to successfully
operate a wireless telegraph system be
tween the Farallones and Point Reyes
than between any other two known
points on the surface Of the earth. Sec
retary Wilson, Chief Moore and Mc-
Adie are agreed- on this question. The
winds are nearly always high, \ the fog
is generally heavy, the sea is "never
calm and if electrical atmospheric
waves can travel between the two sta
tions, at. any time and under any
weather conditions, it Is positive that
wireless telegraphy may be used over
an equal distance anywhere.
McAdie said yesterday that If a storm
were coming to Southern California and
he knew it, then the knowledge would
be worth a million dollars to the agri
culturists. The meteorologists will be
immensely benefited from a scientific
standpoint when the weather off coast
can be known daily. Problems \ which
have been puzzling the weather experts
for many years will be solved, and the
results will be awaited eagerly by the
scientists of every civilized country.
McAdie declares that the ferry service
in the harbor w!ll be improved incalcula
bly when the boats use wireless teleg
raphy. Collisions will be averted on
foggy nights. The courses of the steam
ers may be maintained without fear of
going wrong because the lights cannot
be seen. The sinking of the San Rafael
and the running aground of the Sausa
lito were accidents that might have
been averted if these ferryboats had
been communicating with each other
and the shore by means of wireless
telegraphy.
CONDITIONS UNFAVORABLE.
The present defense lines at the en
trance to the harbor are dangerously
short. All three systems of batteries
are powerful, and the stream may
be mined, but time should be given for
the preparation of a defense. Dispatch
boats prepared to transmit wireless
messages would give all the warning
necessary for adequate, protection.
A hostile fleet could not enter the har
bor If the defenses were properly
manned and the defenders were aware
of what was coming. Hongkong coul4
almost as easily be taken. Wireless
telegraphy applied to the defenses of
this port would make it impossible for
some Dewey of a foreign power to steal
into the harbor some dark night over a
thoroughly mined channel.
But in times of peace wireless tele
graphy at San Francisco will prove no
less valuable to the people of the city
and of the State. When boats are going
or coming they can signal ahead what
may be the state of the weather. In
this way the forecaster will know if a
storm is approaching and how severe it
may be. . -
the harbor unnoticed, when every ob
server on this part of the coast was en
deavoring to find a trace of her. When
the ship was discovered shÂ£ was al
most up to Meiggs wharf.
Such a happening as that in the case
of a foreign man-of-war on# mischief
bent would result disastrously. McAdie
will not at present tell the name of the
vessel, nor when the thing happened,
but he says that he is ready to come
iorward with the proof if the military
authorities are skeptical. 'â¢ '
DEFENSE LINES AKE SHORT.
When ships of this port equipped
with the proper apparatus are ap
proaching port the information may be
sent broadcast long before the vessels
heave in sight. Frequently ocean liners
get outside the heads Just at nightfall
and cannot enter the harbor until the
following day. If they are in commu
nication with the shore boats may be
sent out to them and mails may be dis
patched across the continent many
hours before it would be possible under
the present arrangement.
If passengers or ship's officers are in
great haste to communicate with peo
ple ashore messages may be sent by
means of wireless telegraphy and trans
ferred to the regular telegraph or tele
phone lines. In such a case as that
Consul General Wildman would not
have been in such urgent haste to have
had the Rio de Janeiro come into port.
Under present conditions the military
authorities might possibly only have a
short warning to prepare for an at
tempt by an enemy's fleet to enter the
harbor and take the city. Professor
McAdie asserts that he has indisputa
ble proof that a vesserre'cehtly entered
The inventors* superiors sent imme
diate commands that applications be
made for patents on all new devices in
use at the Farallones and Point Reyes
stations. It is intended that the Gov
ernment shall be protected in respect
to the discoveries made by its em
ployes. McAdie and Thiessen have
merely a scientific interest in their ex
periments and had no intention or de
sire to patent their inventions until
they were commanded to do so by their
superiors.
Immediate benefits will be reaped by
the people at large as' soon as vessels
are equipped with the necessary appa
ratus. California will take a long step
forward in the race for State pre-em
inence. Science, agriculture and com
merce will an be advantageously af
fected. '"','>'
Secretary Wilson and Chief Moore
have been apprised of the success of
their subordinates, and both are highly
pleased. As a particular and unusual
mark of his appreciation of what has
been accomplished at San Francisco,
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson has
sent a telegram to McAdie congratu
lating him and wishing him happiness
for the new year, which has been so
auspiciously begun.
The greatest fear of the local officials
of the Weather Bureau is that the
higher authorities may stop their work
and turn it over to some other branch
of the Government for further investi
gation. It is certain that both Secre
tary Wilson and Chief Moore will do all
in their power to let McAdie and Thies
sen continue their labors without in
terruption. \ .
MUST GET PATENTS.
McAdie, Thiessen and their assistants
had accomplished their purpose. From
now on, the growth of the new science
under governmental protection is as
sured.
The system has worked and wfll work
again. Future progress will be in the
line of improvements. The possibilities
of what may be accomplished are prac
tically limitless.
The exoeriment was a success. The
difficulties which had been besetting the
Government experts for years had been
overcome. It was demonstrated beyond
all doubt that the system was practical.
Shortly after dayljght yesterday sig
nals were sent from Thiessen and
Hobbs on the Farallones to Observer
Thompson at Point Reyes and other
signals were returned. The apparatus
appeared to be in perfect order. The
receivers at Point Reyes showed plainly
the contact with the electrical waves
sent through the atmosphere from the
station out on the horizon.
McAdie at his office on the tenth floor
erf the Mills building followed the
course of the preliminary tests by tele
phonic instruction from the operator at
Point Reyes. Intense anxiety was felt
lest something should break down at
the last minute and retard the an
nouncement of success in the great un
dertaking. At twenty minutes to 12
o'clock McAdie sent word to Thompson
at Point Reyes to direct Thiessen and
Hobbs at the Farallones to transmit
the first official message over the wire
lees telecraph line.
SENDS GREETINGS TO "CAL.L."
At nine minutes to 12 o'clock the re
ceiver at Point Reyes began to show
disturbances, which gradually became
Intelligible to the operator and were
transmitted over the telephone to Mc-
Adie in the Mills building. The latter
immediately sent the message to The
Call. The first official message over the
Government's first successful wireless
telegraph line follows:
"Farallones, Jan. 3, 1904.
"To The Call:
"Farallones send greetings to Call
by wireless.

Thfessen came to San Francisco from
the Farallones last Friday morning for
the purpose of securing apparatys with
which a decisive test of the working of
the new system might be made. After
a consultation with his superior officer.
Professor McAdie. final preparations
were made. Saturday afternoon Thies
sen returned to his station at the Far
allones on a tug.
He went immediately about repairing
certain defective pieces of the appar
atus and shortly after nightfall every
thing was in readiness for the official
test. It was decided to wait until yes
terday morning before beginning to
transmit messages across the twenty
odd miles of water in order that the
tired workers might have an oppor
tunity to rest.

RENDERS
A REPORT OF WORK
TO HIS SUPERIORS
The details of installation
were completed sufficiently on
December 8 to make teste. Sig-
nals were received that day at
the Point Reyes station. Two
days later complete words were
received at both stations. The
stations are nowr practically
more efficient than we ever had
the Slantee and Ilatteras sta-
tions. The present installation Is
the first one which we have at-,
tempted to place on a practical
basis and this brought out weak-
nesses In the detail " which re-
quired additional study. Barring
a Â«few conveniences which may
be added to present installation,
I may say that the work of in-
stallation Is practically com-
pleted. â Alfred H. Thiessen.

first half by straight line bucking. Zis
ka did some splendid playing, taking
the ball through the left tackles. from
the five- yard line.
In the second half Brooklyn played a
bucking game. , La Unions, held the
ball during the greater portion of the
half. The Brooklyns clearly had the
advantage, but neither side was able
to score during the half. \The game
was an Interesting one, and all the clev
er plays were applauded.
Following Is the line-up of the two
teams:
The season of 1904 vrill bÂ« split in
half after the plan adopted by the old
National League a few years ago.
This means there will be two separate
seasons of four months each. The
team that leads during the first half
of the season and the team which has
the best of the second half. are to
meet in a post-season of nine games
for the championship.
These nine games will be divided
between San Francisco and Los An
geles, no matter which two teams
may figure in the result of the series.
Should one club lead at the end of
each division of the season that club
will be awarded the pennant without
going through the formality of play
ing a post-season series.
A committee composed of Messrs.
Morley. Harris and Bert was appoint
ed to confer with James Hart, presi
dent of the Chicago National League
team: Ban Johnson, president of the
American League, and Edward Han-
Ion, manager of the Brooklyn National
League team, when they arrive in this
city to have a talk with the Coast
League magnates regarding the coast
organization entering the National
agreement.
All players who Jumped the Coast
League last season will be blacklisted
forever. This decision is final and
the magnates will not waver. Ac
cording to this decision Hulselman,
Hollingsworth and Lawler. who have
already signed with Portland, and
Walters, who has been secured by
Seattle, will not be allowed to play
ball here.
Messrs. Harris, Morley and Cohen
were appointed a committee on sched
ule. It was decided that Seattle
should open the season at Sara Fran
cisco, 'Oakland at Los Angeles and
Portland at Fresno with the Tacoma
team. Tacoma will play the first five
and the last five weeks of the season
at Fresno. The magnates have suc
ceeded In getting backing at that town
and it will be a sort of half home
burg for Mike Fisher and his Tacoma
stars.
The price of admission will remain
at 25 cents. Some of the magnates
were in favor of raising the tariff, but
it was finally decided to stick to the
old rate. There will be no salary
limit. An application for admission
from Spokane was received and tern*
porarily laid on the table. It Is pos
sible Spokane may become a member
of the league if another good city can
be secured.^
All the 'teams in the league last
year with the exception of Sacramerito
were fined $300 each for allowing"
their players to leave the field during
the progress of a game. The mag
nates decided to meet again this morn
ing at 11 o'clock. It is possible that
to-day's session will be- the final one..
'The reservatidn clause of 1902 waa
adopted. This means that all play
ers who were signed by any club of.
the league during the season of 1902
and including the season .of 1903 are
still under contract to the club which
signed tl\em and will have to be re
leased by the club before they can
sign with another city in this league.
The 'second day's session of thÂ©
magnates who control the Paclfio
Coast Baseball Leagrue resulted In tha
transaction of much important busi
ness. Including: the appointment of a
committee to meet the Eastern League
representatives regarding the affilia
tion with the other leagues of the
country, appointing a schedule com
mittee, naming: the length of the com
ing season and ruling against all play
ers who Jumped the league last year.
TVh?n the second period was more
than half ovrr and it seemed likely
to be a draw match with no peal on
cither fid* thÂ«> Albion Hovers scored a
point. 7h* Hornets playr-d fiercely to
equal \Z" the score, but were unable to
make a coal. For the wirners Brad

serted that Hill was a member of the
Driggs gang of counterfeiters, which
operated a number of years and finally
was brought to book in Dayton, Ohio.
The hearing is set for January 9 at

Sherman claims that Hill was his
brother, who fled from their home in
Cayuga County, New York, because he

name was LÂ». D. Sherman, and says
that his brother on the eve of his flight

A new order of service was inaugu
rated yesterday afternoon at the
Young Men's Christian Association, to
be known as the "men's social reli
gious hour."
Several hundred were present and
listened to a powerful address by the
Rev. Frank S. Ford, pastor i of the
First Christian Church, his subject be
ing "Dead or Alive." The control of
one's self over all things that are not
moral was the principal theme, the
Rev. Mr. Ford holding: that when a
man has control of himself he actually
lives, but he who has no control is
dead and is ruled or directed not by
himself but by influences which he has
allowed to take hold of and own him.
Robson's orchestra, a most capable
body of young musicians, and the First
Congregational choir and Knicker
bocker Quartet rendered music and
vocal selections.
After the "social religious hour" in
the auditorium there, was an adjourn
ment to the lecture-room, where
Henry J. McCoy, general secretary of
the association, conducted a Bible
class. The great body of men joined
in singing numerous inspiring hymns.

ER WHO DIED IN THIS
CITY YESTERDAY.
Joe Kelly,- in the role of an otfium
smoker, is all very well in a short
sketch on the' vaudeville stage, but
three hours of his antics in "The Head
Walters"- is conducive to somnolence.
William Inman and Jack "Vincent, as
"Percy and Harold," 'are absurdities of
a pronounced type, and go in for con
siderable "horse play" to raise laugh
ter.
Charles Burkhart, In a Hebrew role,
was amusing, .but that kind of charac
ter has been done to death on the local
stage. Dolly de Vyne and Frances
Hayford Inman are two clever women,
who would appear to better advantage
in a good musical comedy.
' The chorus^ of. "The Head Walters"
redeemed the performance yesterday
by good ensemble singing and some
pretty dancing. Two large audiences
witnessed the opening performances of
the company.
There are lots of pretty girls and
clever singers and dancers in the com
pany, who earn applause by hard work,
but the principals have but little right
to be classed as "stars.".
. The - company that opened a wee"k's
engagement at the Grand Opera-house
yesterday l afternoon in. a production
called "The Head Waiters" is certainly
to be pitied for being called upon to
appear 'in such a hotch potch of non
sense and absurdity.
Probably the best horizontal bar per
formers seen in the theater in months
are Dumitrescu, Van Auken and Van
nerson.. .Van Auken is a marvel and
goes over the middle bar from a giant
swing with ease. His forward somer
saults after finishing a trick must be
seen to be appreciated. New pictures
on the biograph finish a very good
show.
The road show has departed and an
entirely new. programme is presented
by the Orpheum this week and is well
worth seeing. The "reappearance of
Joan Hadenfeldt, the clever San Fran
cisco 'girl, who evolved the â¢"Cycle of
Love." the musical art maze, reproduc
ing the celebrated masterpieces of the
world's famous painters, was pleasing
to the audience. Not only are the
pictures portrayed by the tiny cupid
and a beautiful model, good to look
upon, but the music interspersed is
sweet and catchy. Miss Hadenfeldt
was more at home on the stage, and
she moved about with that case and
grace that comes with experience. Her
singing was somewhat stronger last
night, but her voice needs more culti
vation. ' Her gowns are very, beautiful
and the electric light effects in harmo
ny with the scenes portrayed.
Lotta a"hd Belle Tobin scored a big
hit last night by their selections on
various musical instruments. They
are extremely clever performers and
also have a good stage presence. Prob
ably the best work they do is the rend
ition of Sir Arthur Sullivan's "The Lost
Chord," .which they play with great
feeling on bamboo bells.
-Frederick Halkn and Molly Fuller,
two favorites, returned from a'suc
cessful Australian tour, and opened
last night. â¢ They presented" an absurd
concoction called "An Election. Bet."
It created a great deal of laughter and
applause. Erneet Hogan and Mattie
Wilkes sang new songs and created
mirth by their specialties. Charles and
Minnie Sa- Van introduced a comedy
act that was replete with funny mis
haps.. Charlotte Guyer George has a
splendid contralto voice. The merry
manikins controlled by, Mr. and Mrs.
Walker Deaves amused the young and
old.
-The show opens with a barber shop
scene in which many clever specialties
are introduced. An aggregation of
vaudeville talent of a high order is
included in the cast and before the
curtain falls the success of the play
is insured. In the second act, a trolley
car appears* and two contributing
comedians, Ned Knnx and John Price,
in . command of t vehicle, became
popular with the audience. Their work
is full of action and they are the oc
cassion of many comical difficulties.
Passengers of all descriptions appear,
are inveigled to ride, and "Happy Hool
igan/' while tampering with the lever
of the turntable, winds up the act with
much excitement ancTmerriment.
There are many people in the cast
and all are artists. All join the lead
ing character in causing amusing sit
uations, and the policeman invariably
appears and settles all strife. The last
act is , a courtroom scene and is re
plete with funny incidents. All intri
cate matters are straightened out and
"Happy Hooligan" renders account for
all of his offenses. In the cast are:
.Paul Bordman, George Knox, Charles

Tunnel was a fine specimen of man
hood, 41 years of age. He was a na
tive son, unmarried, and lived at 600
Railroad avenue. lie was accounted
one of the most skillful vaqueros on
the coast and had no equal as a buyer
of cattle. ***"â¢
James Tunnel, a vaquero, was rid
ing along Silver avenue on Saturday
morning shortly after 10 o'clock and
at Twentieth street he was, thrown
from his horse. The animal kicked
him on the back of the head as he.at
tempted to rise.
Tunnel went to Dr. McLaughlin's
drug store at Eleventh and Railroad
avenues, where a clerk dressed a
wound en the back of his head. Tun
nel then went to Thomas Kelley's sa
loon at 900 Railroad avenue and.re
mained there drinking all day. About
9 o'clock that night he went to a rear
room of the saloon and half an hour
later his dead body was found.
The South San Francisco Police sta
tion was notified and Policeman
Gaughran, after visiting the saloon,
telephoned to the Coroner's office and
the body was removed to the Morgue.
It was thought that Tunnel had died
from natural causes, but an autopsy
made by Dr. L. D. Bacigalupi yester
day morning showed that death was
due to a fracture of the base of the
skull, evidently caused by the kick
lrom the horse.

A newly constructed dock on the isl
and of Mitaunosho-maru, near Onomi
chi, has cost only $75,000. The dock is
420 feet in length, sixty-five feet in
w'dth of entrance and thirty feet over
the sill, and can accommodate vessels
400 feet in length. It is cut out of de
composed granite and faced with rough
hewn stone.
Drydock builders have experienced so.
An airship for war has been invented
and built by Dr. F. A. Barton of Lon
don, who has offered the sole rights to
several Governments for $500,000 or
$50,000 for a single ship. The airship
is a combination of a cylindrical bal
loon with movable aeroplanes. Thirty
or the latter in three rows of ten each
are fixed to a frame between the bal
loon and car and depress or raise thv
ehip. The balloon is 176 feet long and
43 feet in diameter, with a cubic ca
pacity of 235,000 feet and a lifting
power cf 16,<50 pounds. It has" an
outer cover said to be impervious to
shot. It will have a captain who is
to manipulate the fifty-horsepower
motors and the aeroplanes. The crew
consists of six men. Each motor
drives two triple fix-bladed propellers,
thres on each ride of the aerial war
craft, which is expected to have a
speed of twenty miles an hour. As an
agent in warfare this airship will be
useful in Failing over a city, fortifica
tion or man-of-war and dropping dyna

veloping 15.556 horsepower and 18.4
knots sneed with 243 pounds of steam
in the boilers. 116.5 revolutions and
coal consumption of 1.7 pounds per
unit of horsepower. The Queen was
built at the Devcnnort dockyard, laid
down March 12. 1901, launched March
8, 1502, and is likely to be completed
before April, 1904. thus making her
period of construction practically three
years. A sister ship, the Prince of
Wales, was !aid down at Chatham
March 20, 1901 and launched March 25,
1902, and is getting ready for her steam
trial. . The Queen is fitted with Bab
cock and TVflcox boilers and the Prince
cf "Wales has Belleville boilers, the re

The Dominion of Canada Govern
ment has offered a bonus of three per

TERRIBLE ENGINES OF WAR.
The four dry docks building at Ports
mouth, Boston, League Island and
Mare Island, respectively, were author
ized by act of Congress, May, 1898. The
original plan to construct these docks of
timber was abandoned after the con
tracts had been made, although the
builders were made acquainted with
the fact that concrete and granite was
likely to be substituted, and the in
creased cost be determined by a board
c-f naval officers. Upon this tacit under
standing contracts were let under the,
following dates: Mare Island, July 15,*
1S99; Boston, March 14, 1S99; Ports
mouth, October 2, 1S99, and League Is
land. November 23, 1S29, the time of
completion being about thirty-two
months. At the present time the Mare
Island dock, to be completed by April,
1902. is only 20 per cent advanced; that
at Portsmouth,- 76 per- cent; Boston, SO
per "cent, and League Island. 30 per
cent. The causes which have contrib
uted to these extraordinary delays are
chiefly due to the dilatoriness and un
businesslike methods of the Bureau of
Yards and Docks, whose finicky and
vexatious interference with the con
tractors cause considerable friction and
unnecessary expense. The location o-f
the docks is such as to develop engi
neering difficulties as the work pro
gresses, and which were not studied out
beforehand. This is notably the case at
Mare Island, where it is attempted to
build a dock in a bottomless pit; where
as this trouble could have been avoided
by locating: the dock a couple of hun
dred feet farther inland on solid foun
dation. The same procastination and
lack of forethought extends to all other
improvements in the several navy
yards under the cognizance of the Bu
reau of Yards and Docks, which causes
delay in the proper carrying on of work
in other departments. A striking in
stance of this "time-killing" procedure
is shown in the case of the dock to be
built for which appropriation was made
June 7, 1900, yet no contract for Its con
struction has been, awarded.
PROGRESS IX SHIP' BUILDING.
The progress r-.zde during the past
year on ships building for the United
States navy show some improvement
over 1902. The general average of
progress on eighteen battleships and
armored cruisers was 23.06 per cent, or
roughly at the rate cf 2 per cent a
month. The greatest progress was a
total of 154 per cent on six ships at
Newport News, ranging, from 19 to 36
per cent; the Union Iron Works made a
total of 100 per cent on four ships; the
Fore River yard realized 25 per cent on
each of its two ships. Cramp's 23 per
cent, while Xeafie & Levy and Bath
Iron Works reached 21 per cent, and
Moran Bros., Seattle, are at the foot of
the list with only 17 per cent progress to
their credit. The showing as a whole is
not. quite satisfactory, as the progress
should have been at least 50 per cent
greater without considering the fact
that all the ships were behind contract
time, and no effort appears to have
been made to catch up lost time. As to
the protected cruisers, the advance to
ward completion has been very slow,
excepting the Tacoma. The default of
Lewis Nixon and tLa bankruptcy of the
Trigg Company will defer the comple
tion of the Chattanooga and GalvÂ«ston
another twelve months. Five torpedo
craft, among which is the unlucky
Goldsborough, lack completion within 1
and 7 per cent, and are now five years
overdue on their contract delivery. The
following table shows the condition of
ships at the various yards:
NEW DRY DOCKS.
much difficulty in contracts with the
Government as to cause a general dis
inclination to bid for such- work. A
large concrete dock is to be built at the
New York navy yard, bids for which are
shortly to be inivted, but thus far only
one request has been made for the
plans by a contractor in that line. The
dock is to be 550 feet in length on floor,
ninety feet width of entrance and a
draught over sill of thirty-one feet at
high water. Its estimated cost, with
pumpinp plant, is $1,000,000.
