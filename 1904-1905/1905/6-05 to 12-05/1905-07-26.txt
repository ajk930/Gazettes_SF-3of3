bate In tiie Kikf>Â«i;(^ on the report of
the Â«peciai committee before consider
ing tiie conditiottM Sweden desires to
impose, but the majority incline to the
Â«. jili. urn that tiit-Nc conditions will iA>t
be acceptable to Norway.
STOCKHOLM, July 26. â The Swedish
cabinet resigned in a body yesterday,
following the report of the special com
mittee appointed by the Riksdag to
deal witn the crisis arising from the
secession of Norway from the union.
The resignation of the cabinet was re
ceived without outward manifestations
of excitement. Crowds gathered in the
vicinity of the newspaper offices, but
there was no demonstration.
In Us report, the Riksdag commit-
Ue took the ground tuat the secession
of Norway was unlawful and should
iiot be recogrnized by Sweden, but that
if Norway should formally open the
question of the dissolution of the union,
Kwcdrn wouW.be dlnpased to agreeJto
st-paration upon the following terms:
1. The establishment of a zone on each
side of the frontier, separating the klng>
uoms, within which the present fortifica
tions will be razed.
2. The right vf pasturing reindeer be
longing to Swedish Laplanders in North
Norway.
3. That the transit trade through both
countries shall be secured against ob-
Jectional obstruction.
4. That the status of Sweden in respect
to foreign powers, as established by
treaty, shall be clearly defined, so that
Sweden shall be completely freed from
responsibility for Norway to other
states.
FAVORS ARBITRATION TREATY.
The committee also regards an arbitra
tion convention between Sweden and
Norway as desirable, although It does
not consider it an essential condition for
the dissolution of the union.
Editorials in the newspapers this morn
ing generally express satisfaction over
the unanimity of the special committee
In its reports to the Riksdag. Accord-
Ing to well-informed persons the reason
for this unanimity was that the com
mittee had previously received informa
tion to \.hf effect that Norway was will
ing to submit to a referendunm the ques
tions of the establishment of a neutral
zone and the razing of minor fortifica
tions, but that ehe would not consent
to a general election. It Is understood
that a referendum could be arranged to
take place within a fortnight. Alto
gether the prospects are regarded as
peaceful.
Much depends upon the character of
the new Ministry. If it Is not of a too
Conservative or Nationalist color nego
tiations are expected to proceed smooth
ly. The King Is being urged to choose
strong men, who, having decided upon
a moderate and conciliatory policy, will
not be turned from it by agitation in
either country.
EXPECT NORWAY TO YIELD.
Several prominent members â¢of the
Riksdag yesterday privately expressed
the opinion that Norway would agree to
a plebescite and that the question of
fortifications wouJd not raise serious dif
ficulty.
The forts are of recent construction,
but of small military value, and their
retention was more a matter of senti
ment, it was said, ,and if forbearance
were displayed In the negotiations no
trouble would arise. ,
Many Swedish politicians are more
concerned over the after effects of a
dissolution, taking the ground that se
cession would so seriously weaken Nor
way In a military sense that she would
be compiled to seek alliances which
might lead to foreign complications, both
Norway and Sweden then becoming act
ive counters in the game of international
politics.
The first news of the condition the
Riksdag's soeclal committee wished to
impose on Norway caused a strong re
sentment among a large section of the
Norwegian people, but already there are
indications that reflection will bring
calmness. Though both the newspapers
and the public appear to strongly ob
ject to a general election, there Is less
oppostlon to the idea of a referendum.

WAR TO END
WITH PEACE
CONFERENCE
This Is the Belief
"of Japanese
Envoy.
Terms to Be Submitted
to Russia Will Be;/
Moderate.
Mikado's People Look Ifpon
America as "An Ally
Without a Treaty."
NEW YORK, July 25. â That Japan
will demand an indemnity of Rusoia
In the negotiations for. peace and that
the war will be declared at an end at
the conclusion of the negotiations at
Portsmouth, N. 11., next month, is the
belief of Huron Komura, head of the
Japanese peace delegation, who arrived
here to-dsy.
His opinion" is voiced by Almar Sato,
who is the official spokesman for the
Baron on this mission. Sato, in an sin
terview to-night, said: _
"I am confident that peace will be
successfully negotiated by the appoint
ed-delegations. The Japanese will be
guided by moderation, and no excessive
demands will be made, -but the senti
ment In Japan and Russia is for peace,
and In the Interests of humanity and
propriety there must be peace.
"The cost to Japan has been very
great. On both sides the loss In men
has been 570.000, (Russia losing 370,000
of these. The war .is costing Japan
$1,000,000 a day and there -is a feeling
that there oupht to be u.n indemnity."
Asked as ts the probability of an
armistice. Sato said that *." would be
among the: first questions the plenipo
tentiaries would consider- Basing 'the
form of the negotiations on previous
treaty negotiations, Japan would make'
the demands for Russia's consideration,
he said. '
FEELING IN DAI NIPPON.
The peace terms, while held inviolate
b7 those who knew J their text, were
formulated by the Emperor of Japan
and his council.
. Sato was asked if, in the flush of vic
tory,, the' Japanese people would not
feel entitled to more, than any treaty
would allow. Sato said:
"The Japanese people are not so
gentle as to abide by any decision we
may make, but they pay great respect
to the offices of President Roosevelt
and *his acts have done a great deal
to emphasize the need for peace."
Sato further said that the Japanese
would prefer to have, the negotiations in
the English language, as neither Baron
Komura nor himself spoke French.
This, however, would be settled after
President Roosevelt had met the two
representatives. As to the attitude of
the Japanese members toward the Rus
sian delegates, Sato said:
"We admire M. de Witte and Baron
Rosen. The announcement of M. de
Witte's appointment to the peace con
ference was more welcome to- us than
that of any other person could have
been. We recognize him as a great
statesman."
JAPAN TO BIS CHINA'S PROTECTOR.
Of the future'of ChinaSato;said:
"If the central government could
work in harmony with the district- or
provincial governments, / China would
become a great power; but, at present,
that seems to be impossible."
Japan's attitude toward China was
most friendly, said Sato, and whilo
maintaining no moral Monroe doctrine
over the empire, .she felt that it was
more or Jess under Japan's protection.
This protection, by way of illustration,
Sato said, was not so strong over China
as that of the United Staes over South
America. '> X. :
Sato emphasized the announcement,
made frequently, before, > that Japan did
not seek territorial aggrandizement, and
on this point said: .
"We want in Manchuria equal opportu
nity or what. Mr. Hay called the 'open
door/"-V:- â¢ \u25a0;
In response to further questions,: Sato
said that Japan was overpopulated and
that in the opening of Manchuria*' and
Korea an attractive field for immigration
would be nearer' home . than offered in
Hawaii or America.
IV OT FOR PEACE AT AXY PRICE.
Sato said that, while a desire" for peace
was the sentiment of Japan, it was not
a desire for peace at any price." : ;:
"Japan is in a very prosperous condi
tion at present," he said, "and the war
taxes do not; fall heavily upon the peo
ple . yet. ; , There has already ' been * sub
scribed. $250,000,000 to a new Internal loan,
and our prosperity is further indicated in
the success of our foreign loans."
As to Japan's attitude toward, America;
Sato laughingly asked: "You < mean the
yellow peril?", and then became more "en
thusiastic in his conversation j than , upon
any previous topic. He . said :
"We are almost boyish in our tfnthu
siasm and friendship for America. While
weare friendly with China* as Orientals,
our greatest friends, are America; and
England. Why, the first monument ever
erected to any â¢ foreigner, J in Japan â¢ was
that to Commodore Perry and the policy
and conduct the American \ people I for
the laÂ«t fifty years has. been one of. help
to us: :We regard America as an ally

Russia and Germany
ST. PETERSBURG, July 25.â Gossip
Â»nd conjecture arc busy with the reasons
for and the results of the meeting
between Emperor William and Emperor
Nicholas off the Island of Bjoeikoe, ; but
the return of the Russian imperial party
to Ptterhof has added nothing definite
to the information regarding the subjects
discussed or the conclusions reached at
thxÂ» private interviews between the* two
sovereigns. Under the circumstances no
authoritative statement can be made, and
the only information vouchsafed, is that
the conversations were extremely cordial
and friendly.
The belief that the meeting will make
for peace was reflected on the Boerse to
day. Imperial fours rising a full. point
to BSI4 in a firm market.
ThÂ« importance of the meeting is rec
ognized In the press comments of all
shades of opinion. Various conjectures
are a/ivanced as to its real meaning, but
the>Â» are all admittedly guesswork.
The Boerse Gazette has a well-written
edjtcrfal, pointing to the faÂ«t that' the
grod, neighborly relations with o?rraSLiiy
enabled Russia to withdraw par f of her
army from her western frontier, and de
clares it is the duty of Russian diplo
macy to strengthen these relations, at the
same time maintaining that the Franco-
Russian alliance, made in the Interest 'of
peace, must in no wise be disturbed, and:
that neither France rior Great Britain
lias any reason to worry over the confer
ence.
The Novoe Vremya. after cataloguing
the \u25a0 various suppositions advanced, de
clares it is useless to guess which of them
received especial attention, and concludes
sagely that it is some times good to have
a diplomatic question discussed without
the af^ietance of professional diplomats.
Liberal circles are inclined to look
askance at the meeting, the pessimists be
lieving that it bodes ill to reform, and
the Otchtstva sees in it the future visit
of a German sauadron to Russian wat
ers and disaster to Russia, economically
and politically.

Reconnaissance* and Outpost Affairs
Relieve Monotony of Camp Life.
FUSAN, July 25. â The past three
months, with both armies, has been
the most quiet period of the entire war.
There have been no engagements at
the front, the only encounters beiag.
those of reconnoitering expeditions sent
out by both armies similar to that of
last Friday, with a small total of
losses and a few trifling encounters 'at
the outposts. â¢ .
The Russian and Japanese lines -.are
seven miles apart. The Russians main
tain a screen of cavalry outposts some
miles In front of their trenches to
guard against attacks. Reconnoitering
forces from both sides travergÂ« the
neutral zone frequently feeliog the
strength of the others at the front and
making a small weekly list of killed,
wounded and captured.
The right reported on Friday was the
first worthy of mention which- has oc
curred east of the railway. Two Rus
sian reconnoitering forces approached
the Japanese line, one â¢ about twenty
miles, the other seventy miles east of
the railway. The first contingent con
sisted of two squadrons of cavalry, the
second of two battalions of Infantry.
Both retired after brief encounters.
The Japanese sustained no losses, but
those of the Russians are supposed to
have been nearly 100.
In the first encounter the Russian
cavalry, with its front side 1000 meters
long, advanced upon the Japanese line
until it came under fire, when it re
tired in confusion and the infantry ad
\*anced. The Japanese fired forty;
rounds with a captured Russian bat
tery when the Russians retired, the
Japanese Infantry following them for
ten miles.

CHICAGO. July 25. â "There ; can be
no great, reform In the affairs of Ameri
can municipalities until the political
boss and the labor union cease to be
dictators They are the greatest curse
the United States has to contend with."
Thl.rls the keynote of Jame3 Dal
rymple's famous letter, in which * bo
reported to Mayor Dunne his sugges
tions on the question of the munlcipali
zation of Chicago street railways. The
much .discussed epistle of the Scotch
traction expert to the Mayor of Chicago
has never been made public. It ha 3 be
come, known that the Dalrymple report
abounds in epigrams that are terse and
cutting. Those who have been, favored
with ;Â» peep at the document 'describa
it as., striking, caustic and containing
many* features that come as a surprise
from a man who passed so brief a pe
riod'amid the conditions he attacks.
... JCo such reform as the proposed
municipal traction system can be suc
cessfully brought about where Ameri
can labor union principles find support,
he: declares, adding that the same' \l&
"true of Americans-political methods, i
>1 The -first reform the Scot advises is
the elimination of the two great politi
cal parties.'. in so -far as municipal elec
tions are concerned, holding that' so
lorig ..v as -' the ' party bos 3 dic
tates nominations and the . partisan
spirit maintains improved conditions
are impossible."
"I have the highest regard for the
Mayor- of Chicago," Dalrymple writes,
"yet that does not alter the fact that
the-tfteory of American politics Is op
posed to public ownership. Until the
system i^phanged. American cities can
never' hope for successful> % municipal
ownership and operation of public util
ises., Thlsjs as true of Cleveland.as
of Chicagoâ of New York and Philadel
phia as bf Cleveland." j f .:
The dlsttngulshed traction expert
hold 3 that there is no place In the econ
omy* of municipal government for either
-a Democratic or Republican party. H3
holds that the Issues. and questions of
public policy should constitute plat
forms for the opposing forces In local
elections and that the political ma
chinery and: nominating power should
be taken from self-constituted dictators
in the various wards and political sub
divisions.
\u25a0Referring to organized labor, he ns
serts that he believes In such organi
zation, although not along the lines
adopted in the United States. He ex
presaes the view that arbitration Is the
only remedy for disputes between em
ployer and employes, and suggests a
system of compulsory arbitration as a
solution of difficulties such as precipi
tated the teamsters' strike. American
unions as now conducted, .ha insists,
make for a dictatorship that ts Intol
-erable. stifle honest, and
the introduction and development of
proper mechanical. devices in public
work and place municipal operation out
of the question.

engineering department at the -navy
yard shows that during the past five
years not more than $50 worth of re
pairs have been made at the Mare
Island Navy Yard on the boilers of the
Bennington. This work was on the
grate bars.
In the latter part of 1901 the Ben
nington wai placed out of commission
and a survey upon her boilers reported
that they were in first-class condition.
The boilers were built in 18S9 and
were made to stand a pressure 0f '165
pounds. Age and use gradually wore
upon the steel and when the ship went
Into commission again the gauges were
set down to 135 pounds. What the
gauge showing at the time of the ex
plosion was not known at Mare Island.
Commander G. B. Ransom, head of
the steam engineering department at
the Mare Island Navy Yard, has been
ordered to San Diego, where he will
have charge: of the engineering work
on the Bennington and will probably
serve on the board of Inquiry that will
be selected by Rear Admiral Goodrich.
A party of four hospital steward ap
prentices under the command of Hos
pital Steward W. E. Pearman left the
navy yard this morning, en route to
San Diego to assist in caring for the
wounded.

Admiral Goodncn
"Makes a Brief -
Stay Here.
- \u25a0 - \u25a0 .
The United States cruiser Chicago,
flagship of the' Pacific squadron, with
Rear Admiral \u25a0 Goodrich on board, ar
rived yesterday from the north and
after taking on -200 tons of coal left
for San Diego, where Admiral Good
rich will assume charge of the inves
tigation; into the Bennington disaster.
\ To Admiral Goodrich-i and J ? tb^ ail-on
board the Chicago the news of j - the
-Bennington tragedy was a great shock.
In the absence of 'first-hand knowledge
there Is little that Admiral Goodrich
can or, will say on the matter. The
hews of the, Bennington disaster was
communicated to those on board \ the
flagship at Bellingham the v day after it
occurred and through the medium of a
Seattle newspaper which some trades-
man' brought on; board.- ~-
The Chicago, Marblehead and Perry
had just returned from their cruise in
Alaskan waters. They joined the Bos
ton and: Paul Jones at Bellingham and
it was Admiral Goodrich's intention to
take the fleet to Port Angeles 'or tar
get practice. ,When he heard of the
disaster to the Bennington. however,
he Ordered the other ships of the
squadron to carry, out the. original pro
gramme." The Chicago, three hours
after her arrival at Bellingham, was
on her. way to this port. She was
short of- coal and twelve knots was all
the speed the flagship made on her run
south. \u25a0'.â¢ . \u25a0
Within a few minutes after she an
chored off Clay street yesterday two
coal barges from Mare ; Island were
alongside the Chicago and bluejackets,
marines, petty officers and commis
sioned officers were hustling coal from
the barges to the Chicago's bunkers.
"The only official knowledge I have
of the Bennington disaster," said Ad
miral Goodrich yesterday, "was a brief
dispatch I received from Captain Young
just before \u25a0 we left Bellingham. At
that time even his knowledge of the
affair was limited, so you see I am not
in a position to discuss the matter
however willing I might be to do so.'

W. Sullivan Lost From the
Manchuria During Trip to
Hawaii From San Francisco
REWARD FOR THE BODY
Thousand Dollars Offered,
but It Is Not Thought the
Remains Will Be-Recovered
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, July 19.â -W. Sullivan,
the passenger who was drowned from
the Manchuria on her trip from San
Francisco to Honolulu, is generally
thought to have deliberately ended his
life.
. Sullivan was on his way to Manila to
visit his sister, the wife of Colonel J.
Clem. On boarding the steamship at
San Francisco he received a telegram
which said, "Do not return until after
January." -.This seemed to depress his
spirits for a time. He told several of
the passengers that in a street fight in
San Antonio, 1 Texas, his home, some
time ago, he had been hit on the head,
and his friends say that this blow af
fected his. brain. - %
On Wednesday evening, July 12; how
ever, he appeared very jovial and had
been drinking somewhat. Late in the
'evening' a lady on deck saw him pass
and he was In evening clothes, but
only wearing one shoe. Shortly after
ward the woman thought she saw a
body go overboard.
The next morning, however, when
Sullivan did not appear at the table,
bis room mate made an ' Investigation
and then It was found that he must
have arone overboard. . .. -
The dead man's ' brotJier has cabled
from San Antonio, Texas; offering a re
word of 11000 for the recovery of the
body. As the incident occurred in mid
ocean it is not considered likely that
the body will be recovered.

element of citizenship can be â¢ won if
every citizen who has the welfare of
the city at heart resolves to do his plain

The executive committee of the league
is apprised of the fact that the Ruefters

mind that the tickets of the San Fran
cisco' Republican League j are the only
genuine Republican tickets In the field.
The Republican County Qommfttee In
open meeting rejected the Abe Rtief and
Henry Ac.h.. scheme c/ district organiza
tion under the auspices of said commlt
teÂ« by a vote of 47 to X 9. and furthermore
declared in favor of co-operating with
the Â£an Francisco Republican League.
The county committee. lndorses and"up
hold^ the. league. On election day the
bona flde, genuine Republican tickets
will be designated as antl-Ruef. Every
where, in letters of living light, will >c
the words, "Anti-Ruef." The voter, ex
pecting to perform his duty as a citizen
will orovide himself with an anti-Ruef
ticket before leaving home on ' the'morn
ing of election day.
The John C. Lynch and Peter Kellj*
deform forces in the Twenty-eighth As
sembly District are descending "to a low
level of cunning. They have placed on
their ticket and at the head of the bunch
the name "of John C. KlrkpatVlck. man
ager oÂ£ the Palace HoteL Every one
familiar with the .affairs of the district
knoTus that the use of Colonel Kirkpat
rick's name to boost the ticket Is not
authorized- Colonel Klrkpatrick re
marked last njsht that he would be out
of the State when the convention as
sembled. Commenting on the Incident, he
said: "I have no deÂ«lre to run or inten
tion of running on either ticket."--

CAPE MEXDOCINO AND FROM WHICH THE CREW" OF THIRTY-SEVEN .
MEN WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY RESCUED BY LIFE SAVERS.
EUREKA, July 25. â The Norwegian
colier Tricolor is ashore off Cape Men
doclno and within the next few hours
â¢will become a total wreck. In her po
sition no power on earth can save her.
The Tricolor is loaded with six thous
and tons of coal and was bound from
Ladysmith, British Columbia,, to San
Francisco. At a few minutes past three
o"clock this morning she bumped and
within a short time seas were breaking
over her and the crew knew she was
doomed.
At the time she struck Captain Vol
dwson was on â¢watch. The fog was
dense and the sea very rough. " No
warning of danger came until the ves
sel struck on the beach. Rockets were
s:nt up end as soon as daylight came
efforts were made to attract the at
tention of persons on the shore. It was
well into the morning before word of
the wreck reached Eureka. The tug
.uanger immediately started to the
assistance of the vesseL At the en
trance to Humboldt Bay the tug took
aboard the life-savingr crew and boats.
It was 11 o'clock before the tug ar
rl*cd near the. wreck, but it was Impos
ciole to get within a mile of her on ac
count of the rocks.
â¢ The life-saving crew went to the

Â» Heart
Weakness.
Dr. Miles' Heart Cure has
made many hearts well after they
have been pronounced hopeless.. It
has completely" cured thousands,
and will almost invariably- cure or
benefit every case of heart dis-
ease.
Short breath, pain around
heart, palpitation, fluttering, diz-
zy, fainting and .smothering spells
should not be neglected. Take Dr.
Miles' Heart Cure and see how
quickly you will be relieved.
It cannot make a new heart, but
will restore a sick one by. strength-
ening the heart nerves and mus-
cles, relieving the unnatural
istrain, and restoring its vitality.
"I had a very bad case of heart troubl el
For Â«lx months I could' not work. Last
July Iwm plowing corn and feeling- bad
all day; In the afternoon In plowing one
row I* had to He down, or fall -down,
three \u25a0'. time*. My heart throbbed -as
thouffh It would burst through.' and I had
dlfflcultr, in petting my breath. I pur-
chased a bottle of Dr. Miles' Heart Cure,
and before I had-w^ed half of It I could
lie down and sletj all night. Previous-
ly I had to pet up from flyÂ« to ten time*
a nieht. I have taken . several \u25a0 bottles,

crew.' It was so' rough and rocky that
landing could not be maele ashore, so,
tne wrecked crew was taken ,to the
Mendocino lightship anchored a few
miles off Cape Mendocino. : They -were
kept there until \u25a0 the Ranger returned
to rEureka,' when they. were brought
here. AH'of-thVinen are in good shape,
but they had a narrow escape. For the
most part they are Norwegians . and
speak our language brokenly.
Captain Voldwson does- hot know
how-: he gt)t ashore. -At low -water, for
a mile to sea and for many miles north
and- south' the rocks can be ! plainly
seen. 'How the Tricolor got into her
present, position without being ripped
from stem to stern is a mystery to all
seafaring men.. If she were now in
good condition it- would be Impossible
to- pilot her to deep-water without
coming in contact with the jutting
rocks. Just before, the men left the
wreck seas were breaking over her en
tire length, and water was pouring
from her hatches. -

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
FOOTPAD SUSPECT
IS ARRESTED.
Percy. Pembroke Is
Released After
He Talks.
Evidence Against
Two Prisoners
Increases.
OAKLAXD, July 25. â The search for
new evidence was continued to-day by
Sheriff Barnet and his deputies In the
case of Thomas Cook,, who was beaten
into insensibility by footpads Saturday
â¢night. They arrested Percy Pembroke,
another member of the gang to which
-the ' two suspects, John Schneider and
John Blaker; belong. Though Pembroke
was afumrard liberated, he gave Bar
net what Is one of the strongest points
he has against the two men now In
custody. I .- â¢ â¢ -â¢
1 Pembroke was with Schneider and
Blaker a short time before Cook was
struck down. He told Sheriff Barnet
io-da.y that Schneider wore, a cap thai
â¢uight. A. peculiar cap was lound near
the scene of the robbery and was identi
ned by James Crowhurst, another mem
ber of the gang, who said he' had given
the cap. to Schneider, Now Pembroke
says Schneider wore a cap that looked
very much like the one in the posses
sion of the Sheriff. This contradicts the
statement of Schneider, who denied
wearing the cap.
Pembroke, Schneider and Blaker were
given a sweating this afternoon. \u25a0 When
Schneider was confronted by Pembroke
and-hls statement to the effect that he
wore a cap. Saturday night he admitted
that he had on a cap that night, but de
nied that the cap Barnet has was ever
in his -possession.
It was learned to-day that Blaker was
under arrest at Martinez last week and
served a. two days' sentence in the
County Jail there, and was liberated
Friday morning. At that time he did
not have a cent, yet when he was ar
rested Sunday night at the ferries with
(Schneider and two girls he had Jll in
his pocket and they had been spending
money freely all day enjoying the
sights at the Chutes and Golden Gate
Park. V .- .-'
Another damaging statement against
the character of the men is made by
H. F. Cornwall, a barber, of 1160 East
Fourteenth street, who says that one
time he was held up by Schneider and
Crowhurst. and another time by Blaker,
but that he beat them off. Fred Ger
hardt. a' milkman in that neighborhood,
also told the Sheriff that early Satur
day night Pembroke. Schneider and,
Blaker attempted to hold him up.
{ When Questioned about the statement
made by Gerhairt^iUl.pf^h^ -three -said
that what they said "to" mm* 'was in a
joke and that Schneider only attempted
to borrow -41 from Gerhard t.
All day long Sheriff Barnet has kept
ia touch with Drs. Callen and Crosby
at Alameda, who ! are treating Cook.
This afternoon he fell into convulsions,
and . the doctors performed v a" second
operation on his bead and drew off con
siderable fluid, which seemed to give
him relief. He had a brief interval of
consciousness this evening and an ef
fort was made to question him in re
gard to' the assault. While he seemed
to understand what was said, he was
unable to reply. Dr. J. H. Callen said
to-night that his condition was slightly
improved since the operation of this
afternoon, but that it was very criti
cal.
PLATO FALLS \u25a0-AJIOXG.
THE OAKLAND
Wierdly Robed Itinerant Im
bibes Too freely in His
.Wanderings. %
OAKLAND, July 25.â Professor Paul
Foro Plato, garbed in a robe that would
turn an Egyptian monarch green with
envy, fell foul of Policeman Mulgrew on
Broadway this evening. Paul Pozo
Plato was drunk, so Mulgrew sjid, and
that was the charge.
Plato declares he is the. reformed King
of the Earth. His costume was a mix
ture of ancient and modern, a tall silk
beaver, vintage of '61 surmounting a poll
of dark brown hair. The cadaverous
features were embellished with what the
unjtlated term "siders." His gaudy robe
covered a suit of light brown stuff, the
trousers of which didn't meet his shoe
tops by half an inch. Completing the
equipment of the professor was a small
hand bag which contained a number ot
copies of VThe Fault Finder," a pamph
let fUled with nosensical stuff. "Plato"
hails from San Jose. He had a dime in
his pocket, 'and an empty whiskey bottle.
His case will be considered to-morrow in
the Police Court

The institution (fiver which he presides

unique and varied. We have an Income
of half a million a , year .for research.
A~dvlceâ an avalanche =of good and bad
adviceâ has come to us, but our
perience is teaching us that the usejof
our facilities for a small number, of
large projects rather than a large num

which the institution's money â¢ and : men
can be put."

looked into. We expect in a decade, perhaps,
to have some very interesting . and valuable

located our observatory, are superior to those

are obtaining photographs of the sun superior

FOR MITCHELL
Oregon Senator jlust Go to
Prison for Six jlonths and
Pay $1000. Judge Declares
OLD AGE CONSIDERED
Convicted Lawmaker Will
Not Be Confined Until
High Court Decides Appeal
PORTL.^KD, July 25.â United States
Senator Mitchell, convicted of using his
om<e # of' United States Senator to fur
ther the law practice of the firm of
Mitchell A: Tanner, of this city, was
to-day sentenced to pay a fine of {1000
and six months' penal servitude. Pend
ing a review of the case by the' Su
preme Court of the United States exe
cution of the sentence will be deferred.
In the meantime Mitchell will be placed
under bail to the amount of $2000. In
pronouncing sentence upon the aged
United States Senator Judge de Haven
said:
TbÂ« statute under which th* indictment was
found provides that the otfense should be pun
:sh*d Ly imprisonment Â«r nut more than t>vo
yesre. or by it fine of not more than $lo,oi.H>.
ll aJso renders the defendant incapable of
&esin holding any oifice of trust or prwflt in
the United States. As I construe the language
cf the statute th* punishment musi be both
Une and imprisonment, but the court is given
great latitude in Bxl&S the amount of flee
or Imprisonment. The court n.*y make the
jÂ»unishmet;t merely nominal. In pronouncing
judgment It is not my purpose to coinmcr.l
upon the evidence or the verdict found by the
jury. In reaching: a conclusion In this case, 1
have given consideration to the age of the
defendant, which may bÂ» taJten into account
in mitigation of punishment, and the further
fact that h* is former hereafter disqualified
from holdirur oiflce.
In view of these fact* and in consideration
Of the natur* of the offense the judgment of
the court Is that the defendant be imprisoned
for six menth In the County Jail of MuJtno
i:.t!i County, in this State, and that be be
fined In the cum cf JIOW.
During the pronouncing of judgment.
Senator Mitchell watched the face of
the Judge with Intense interest. His
face was flushed and troubled. John H.
Mitchell Jr., the son, who has been in
close attendance upon his aged father,
r,t by his side and when Judge de
Haven uttered the words about impris
onment and the age of the convicted
man his frame shook with emotion and
tears came into his eyes.
The Senator said not a word. When
the words "County Jail of Multnomah
County, in this State." fell upon his
ears, fee sat as one transfixed. Then,
when it was all over and the crowd
started fon the door, the aged defend
ant arose and painfully made his way
out of the courtroom.
Ex-Senator Thurston. senior counsel
for Senator Mitchell, said there was
nothinp: to say on behalf of his client
othtr than that the case would be car
ried to the higher tribunal in the reg
ular way. There are now three bills of
exceptions on file in the case.
The convicting: and sentencing of
Senator Mitchell does not render his
ofiice vacant. If the Supreme Court
ntijrms the decision of the trial court,
however, the action of the higher court
\u25a0rill vacate the office.

Appellate Court Gives Dc
ci sion El iminat ing Sect ion
of County Government Act
SACRAMENTO. July 25.â The District
Court of Appeals for the Third Appellate
District to-day rendered a decision de
claring subdivision 13 of section 184 of
the county government act unconstitu
tional. This is the section which pro
vides for the classification of townships
by population in counties of the twenty
seventh class (Napa) for the purpose of
fixing the compensation of constables and
justices of the peace.
The effect of this decision is far-reach
ing, as it goes to every township in the
State, the constables and justices of the
peace, of which are on salary, and will
cause these officers to go back to the old
fee system. More than that, the Appel
late Court in its . decision reverses the
ruling of the , Supreme Court and the
Superior Courts of Fresno, Calaveras and
Amador counties, \u2666which tribunals have
held the law knocked out to-day to be
constitutional.
While the law was declared by these
courts to be constitutional, the decisions
were rendered on points entirely differ
ent from those passed upon to-day by the
Appellate Court. The- decision was
brought about by the appeal from the
Superior Court of Napa County, holding
the law to be constitutional, the decision
being rendered in the case of. William D.
Johnson against H. U-Gunn, as Auditor
of Napa County, to compel the latter to
draw his warrant for 555, a months' sal
ary, under the terms of the sections of
the county â¢ government act referred to. i

PORT TOWNSEND, . July 25.â The
misfortunes, which accompanied the
initial start of the Great Northern
Steamship Company's steamship Minne
sota on her initial trip across the Pa
cific were duplicated to-day oh her sis
ter ship the big Dakota. Each vessel
suffered an accident to her machinery
of sufficient magnitude to compel her to
return before getting outside 'Capo
Flattery. "With the Minnesota the ac
cident was in a measure lucky, for the
cempany was enabled to change the
destination and remove all possibility
of trouble, while in the case of the Da
kota the delay is a dead loss.
Derplte the secrecy this company al
v/a ya throws abr i.Â«. acciden ts. It enn
be staled positively that a serious sc
cident befell the starboard engine yes
terday and she was compelled to put
back to port under a slow bell and in
a dense fog, arriving just twenty-four
hours after her auspicious start on her
m3ldfci' voyage.
That the damage is of a serious nat
ure is evidenced by the fact that after
the Minnesota's minor mishap involv
ing but slight damage the company
provided the Dakota with duplicate
parts, a complete machine shop equip
ment and selected her engineer start
from men versed in : machine work.
After a brief delay here, the vessel was

SGOEES LOCAL COURTS
Fugitive Lawyer Declares
San Francisco Tribunals
; Are Disgrace to Country
VICTORIA. B. C. July 25.â George D.
Collins, the fugitive San Francisco law
yer, -fighting against extradition : for
perjury, lost another point to-day 'when
Justice Martin of the Supreme Court
refused to grant an order nisi in habeas
corpus^ proceedings [when Collins,',,, dis
puting the overruling of his objections
by Judge Larapman, sought to : secure
a writ of habeas corpus on the ground
that; Judge Lampman had no jurisdic
tion and there was no law in Canada to
make perjury an extraditable offense.
'\u25a0Â« Higgins,. for .the .San po
lice, cited authorities against - these
contentions and to the Jeffect that as
extradition -proceedings are pending, an
extradition commissioner should not" be
Interrupted in this, and also citing the
judgment of Judge Wurtele in Quebec
in re Levy, that perjury ,\ was extra
ditable. .Justice Martin in refusing Col
lins' application, said it would be un
due interference and unfair to the
United States to stop the present pro
ceedings and he held they should con
tinue.- \u25a0
j Collins renewed the fight; for liberty
at noon, however, , when his counsel
went before Justice Duff of the ; Su
preme Court and askedhim to hear the
application made- before Justice Mar-.
â¢tin,- the law, as cited from the Gaynor
and Greene cases,' holding that ; the
fugitive can go before Judge after
.Judge when one has refused his appli
cation. ... .', .-."; ... , ; . ..',
Collins was given scant opportunity for
forensic display when* he fame before
Justice Duff. The application had failed
before .Justice Martin and Collins went
before Justice Duff armed^with a score
or more' law books prepared .to make
similar lengthy speeches : as he made
â¢when "jtating his contentions, to Judge
Lapman. Justice Duff stopped him and
asked him to confine himself to the ques
tion of Judge Lapham's jurisdiction. Ev
ery time" he started * to' make a lengthy
harangue the Judge asked 1 , him to con
fine himself to the point and show author
ity for the contention he relied "upon that
Canada had no authority, to make pro
vision in the extradition act that it
should apply to future acts and treaties.
Judge Lampman ', resumed his sitting
thie afternoon after Justice Martin's
decision and J. J. Groom, deputy
County Clerk of San Francisco, arid
Notary Public F. J. Henry of San Fran
cisco, .gave evidence, the former . pro
ducing all documents in relation to the
uuit'for maintenance brought by.Char
lotta Collins against the accused in
which the alleged perjury was com
mitted.
The documents will be copied for
purposes of the record' so that, the
originals belonging -to the San Fran
cisco-court will not be ' Impounded; v;
. Collins obiected to all. the documents
as incompetent, immaterial and .;^^ not
properly, authenticated.: Henry,
produced his commission and swore re
garding the affldavlt made by Collins
because of which perjury is charged.
He said Collins took oath before him
and stated he knew the contents of the
affidavit were true. v Collins objected to
Henryls commission and evidence, the
points, like the others,' to be argued
later.
In - the -cross-examination of J.. J.
Groom, Collins asked him if he knew
the alimony order he 'produced â¢ was
granted in. a 'private star-chamber pro
ceeding: backed by a conspiracy " for
which. the Courthouse ; at San Fran
cisco was opened late at night and at
which Collins or his attorney were not
given opportunity -to be present.
.Groom said he did not. " Collins then
said to the court ' he would enlighten
the court .as to how matters of law
were conducted at San Francisco in a
manner which | would disgrace a cow
boy country."
Hlggtns replied that he would ; show
the action against Collins was" not con
ducted In- the .star, chamber., proceeding
he alleged. Judge Lampman . said he
did not-sec that these statements con
cerned the facts atlssue In the perjury
chafare before'hinv ' .
RESULT PLEASES BYINGTON.
Glad * That . Collins ils Defeated in His
\u25a0 ' \u25a0 .' Fight tor Delay. \ Â»
District Attorney ! Lewis P. Byington
is pleased over the defeats of George
D. Collins in. the trial that is now being
carried on- In the Canadian court: for,,
the Matter's extradition. The fugitive
lawyer. 1 was worsted in the first, point
that he- raised, questioning the juris
diction of the â¢ court, and In the second,
when tie'applied :for a. ; writ^f : habeas
corpus. '-" The - ! .trial must mow; proceed
without delay, the very thing which
Collins feared and which ; the < author
ities of San Francisco, most; desired.;; lt i
now seems likely: that Collins J will 'be
returned v to the-United States in a very '!
short s time; '* The warrant sent out from !
Washington has I not yet reached I Vic-^
toria, but its arrival ' is expected } dally.
The first ; word that- the District At
torney":received: was from his assistant.
Attorney Rf J V.- Whiting,'- who â¢> went
north ' withjthe witnesses for the ] State
last Friday â¢ night/: He telegraphed to
Byington that Collins had been denied
the writ; of ' habeas corpus and- that all
looked l well l for the State i of ! California.
"I :am : pleased with - the \ news," : said
Byington ' lastfniffht. "and %I ifeel; sure
that t we will speedily have Collins back
among mis.'.. These victories mean that
the trial :must^ proceed: at: once ; and
there will be^no delays such as marked :

I'\u25a0 expect that Collins will \u25a0; do his best

RECIPROCAL TRADE.
rpHE new tariffs made by the leading commercial nations ot
I continental Eufope seem to be in pursuance of a concerted
1 pian. arranged between the political economists of the countries
interested, for "the purpose of striking at the export trade of the
United States. This has not been done by treaty, nor by any public
and aboveboard agreement. They have not said to each other,
"We will exclude the trade of the United States by a differential
tariff, but will agree to trade among ourselves, using for that pur
pose the minimum tariff rate, while using the maximum to keep but
the common commercial enemy." There is a certain shrewdness
shown in this. If the United Stales make reciprocity treaties with
the countries in tfiis tariff bund, we can trade with them at the
minimum tariff rate. Otherwise we must submit to be excluded
and to see our exports decline.
The public men in the bund nations have accurate information
as' to public sentiment in the United States. When the Senate
rejected all of the reciprocity treaties that were negotiated by Mr.
.Kasson, ihe Reciprocity Commissioner of the United States, it was
concluded in continental Europe that, reciprocity died with Blame,
and that the United States was committed to its tariff schedules as
they stand. If this be so, the differential tariffs which have just
been made are perfectly safe as exclusion acts against our ,trade,
for we can get the benefit of the differential only by reciprocity.
The issue in this country is in the nature of a crisis. Means are
being used to test public opinion. The men most interested are
the producers. The livestock men want entry for our meats into
Germany. The fruit planters of California want the right of way
for their canned and dried fruits in continental Europe. American
manufacturers want an outlet for their surplus, which these differ-"
ential tariffs will afford, if we take advantage of their minimum by
reciprocity. On the other hand, we must concede a reciprocal min
imum upon products which may in a measure compete with our own
industries. This is the crux of the situation. Our people are wedded
to the policy of protection and the smallest industry as well as the
greatest demands its benefits. But it goes without saying that
while we produce in one day as much as our own people consume in
three days, there must be an outlet for the surplus, or a limitation ot
output.
It is to be regretted that an angry spirit is shown in the dis
cussion. In the first place Germany and the continental nations
have just as much right to exclude our trade by a differential tariff
as we have to exclude their trade by a protective tariff. So there is
no reason behind any diatribes directed at them for acting within
their rights.
The commercial organizations of New York are taking meas
ures to test public opinion on the subject of the treaties we must
make or be prepared to sacrifice much of our export trade. Those
organizations very properly selected the California State Board of
Trade as a medium through which to reach the public of this
State. That board appointed a committee to make an affirmative
report which will come before the meeting in August for discussion
and action. This report has been published in order that our com
mercial and producing classes may be roused to thought on the sub
ject. We are informed that the report is met in a spirit of great
anger and intolerance in some quarters and with favor in others.
Some of the wine interests especially have threatened to disrupt and
destroy the State Board of Trade because it has taken up the sub- i
ject at all. Such a threat need cause no alarm, for the people be
lieve in fair play and full discussion, and the wine interest is not so
strong in its own righteousness as to have a commission to deny
the right of discussion. The State board is the proper place for
such a discussion. It represents production and commerce, and it
would be a sorry day for both in California if threats and intimida
tion could command silence and suppression as the policy of such
an organization.
The matter should not be closed in one session. Now that the
subject is in focus, let it be thoroughly thrashed out. Let the in

go to the board and give its reasons. The press wants to know the
reasons for and against reciprocity. The people want to know, that
they may act intelligently. Our members of Congress want to
know, that their counsel and their votes may be rightly guided, for
they must represent the interests of their constituents. Those in

The State cannot afford to have it said that one interest, no

threats and domineering to close a forum against the people. We

in beautifying cities, and Alameda.has set a good example to
all the towns of California by generously making that small

games to play in either sport or earnest, for it stirs the energies just

torn down, piles of rubbish removed, arid all lots and yards cleaned
up and made attractive. Let other towns take heed that while such
work is desirable from esthetic obligations alone, there are other
reasons which should urge its performance. Its neglect may cause
a stagnation in business. A clean, neatly kept town gives by that
quality a potent invitation to the most desirable people to come and
make their homes therein or near by. There is always rivalry of
neighborhoods, be it active or unconscious, and the- untidy town is
the most likely to get left if the other advantages are nearly on a

CULTIVATE thft vacation habit.
Take a vacation -every "day. Don't
be content with "only 'a few weeks'
release \ from the grind, but learn how,
every, day- of your life,' 4 to leave your
workaday ' consciousness for a while
and bY refreshed In mind 'and body.
You don't need money to do this. But
you do need an understanding. heart and
the determination to get in touch . with
the" real beauties of life,- no matter In
what -circumstances you may find your
self... ::X'^. : :-v \u25a0"\u25a0'\u25a0 \u25a0"â¢-;'
If you have capacity, and understand
ing and determination you need; not- de
pend upon change of external i scenery
i for \ rest and ; recuperation. > \ ' -â¢ . \u25a0 -
If you have the vacation spirit you can
at any time and In any place :be lifted
out of the monotony; and drudgery of ex
istence and be thrilled with a sense of re-
Juvenation. \u25a0.- '\u25a0 .\u25a0"V"' : :,/- \u25a0;'. ..\u25a0---
After all- the real. purpose of vacations
Is to accomplish.; this. ' The" most Impor
tant thing these periods of rest and pleas
ure do for us; Is to . lift us out . of . our
plodding selves and, show us that there
are other, regions of our being where'ex
hilaration and joy abound, and where we
may go at will for refreshment and re
newing.,; %
A vacation s is vitally helpful to us only
as "it lifts us out of the humdrum and
puts us In touch with our vaster selves
and with our . vaster environment. ,
To come in . touch wi th nature , to
breat A fresh air, to feast j the sight upon
skies; and fields of beauty, bathe In re
freshing waters and bask -In the \u25a0', sun
all this is helpful and j invigorating. But
the deepest benefits of such enjoyment
come through spiritual uplift, through the
realization that after all we live In a uni
verse, and. that there is another life than
the grlnuing existence with which we are
most .familiar. v
God never intended that man should be
a machine, a drudge,, a plodder; with a
cramped - consciousness, a dulled imagi
nation and a warped capacity for spiritual
enjoyment.
â¢When life becomes a grind it Is not life.
To really know wh"at life is, every human
being should :be able to free himself at
times from his , every day consciousness
and know the higher regions of himself.
The reason" so many people grow to
find life dull and prosaic is because they
live constantly' in the workaday con
sciousness. "What ' we shall eat, what
we shall drink and wherewithal we shall
Ibe clothed" becomes the dominant" con
sideration of existence.
The higher regions of being are seldom
if ever visited. What chance in such a
habit of thinking is there for real, exhil
aration and zest in living? -When a hu
man being becomes so callous, so dull,
so unimaginative that he fails to be con
scious of the sweetness, the thrill and
gladness of living, he is dying every day.
There is nothing so important as the
necessity for getting away from the
cramped earth consciousness . and up Into
the exalted Space of one's nature. Any
thing that will- help you to do this is a
blessing, a benefit to you. Do not neg
lect any oppoortunity that may came to
you to do this.
Look up at the stars as often as you
can. Thereis nothing that will so vivid
ly remind you that you are not, after all,
a mere^ mortal pent in an existence of
clay, but an immortal soul, an expression
of the Infinite.
Don't permit yourself to be a machine.
Don't sink into the belief that your nar
row daily existence is' all." Wake up! Lift
your eyes "and 'your thoughts and know
yourself as you are.

OF SAN JUAN BAUTISTA.
California Council of Knights of Columbus to Make the Trip
LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
A pilgrimage to the old Mission of
San Juan Bautista, founded by the
. brown-robed friars of St. Francis in
; 1797 â that is what the California Coun
.cil of the Knights of Columbus will
.undertake on Saturday next.
Where is this old mission?
"Why, pood friend, within less than
four hours* travel from San Francisco,
in the beautiful valley of the San Be
nito, in the shadow of the blue-gTay
Gabilans â with Fremont Peak rising
irom the purple mists as if on guard
over the sleeping mission and the
drowsy -old town about it.
Town â did 1 Bay?
In the poverty of our language lies
my apology.
In the town of San Juan thera are at
l*-ast a half-hundred people, they who
still cling to the old place whence all
lÂ«ut memories have vanished. But
th<-se memories â they are worth the
cherishing. There is the plaza, where,
in the old days, gay carnivals were held
on feast days, when from all the coun
tryside the people came, the servants
in caxretas and afoot, the gentry
mounted as became their station.
Then there's the osd home of Gen
eral Castro on the right of the plaza â
a proud mansion in its time, with its
shaded balcony and its sunny patio.
The place is now owned by the Breen
estate and cared for by a chipper old
iady â Mrs. Flinn â who lives there in
solitary state, treasuring with infinite
care every relic of its past romances.
Then there's* the long, cool corridor of
the mission, with its tiled roof tinted j
softly with the mosses of a century. It ;
is In this corridor that the knights will
be welcomed by the venerable old priest
of the mission. Father Closa â a .splen
did old Spaniard who has* stolidly
chosen to live out his days in the spot
where he has labored for forty years..
Then there is the beautiful old
churchyard â God's acre â In the shadow
of the mission, with its moss-grown
graves o'erhung with roses and honey
suckle; the great buttresses of the
church, covered with wild Ivy and
blackberry vine, tinged with red and
gold, climbing over the famous door
way, well-beloved of the artist.
These are but a few of the interest
ing things about the splendid old mis
sion and its sleepy old town near by â
not the least of which is the old chapel
itself, in which mass will be sung on
Boad&y morning by Father Sesnon of ;
this city, whose splendid voice will ring

through the ancient sanctuary with a
fervor born of reverence for Its past.
While there. Father Closa will show the
visitors the ancient altar ornaments, the
superb vestments brought from San
Fernando, Mexico, by Junipero Serra;
the old bass viol and the violin used
by the Indian neophytes in the service
of the mass; the queer old statues and
the old paintings, a few of the latter
holding some artistic value, as well as
historic
But. good friend, steady yourself for
a shock. If your artistic sense be easily
Jarred.
In the years agone some well-inten
tioned soul, seized with a desire to Im
prove upon the simple but crude beauty*
of the old adobe church, built a wooden
turret on its right, surmounting It with
a monstrous steeple such as is found
upon the country churches in New
England. But one day there came a
great wind which, with more than hu
man intelligence, threw - its force
against the steeple and tumbled it to
earth. But the turret, alas! â escaped
and there it Is yet, a thorn in the sidei
of Those Who Care.
But about those visiting knights,
here are a few of the things they will
do wheTT they start on their pilgrimage
to San Juan Bautista:
Leaving town Saturday on the' 3:3o
train for the south, they will reach
Sargents at 6 o'clock. ; There teams
will await them, landing them at the
mission at 7, when a Spanish dinner,
with Its pungent aroma, will be spread
In the plaza.
The visitors will be -quartered in the
San Juan Hotel â formerly the barracks
of the Californian forces during the
conflict with the Americans under Fre-
mont. \u25a0 .
And then at night comes the superb
climax â a rural grand ball. Full-dress?
If you're handy with your gun. Not
otherwise. ' â¢â¢.t-
Then on Sunday, mass will be sung*
In the old sanctuary, followed by old
time sports in the plaza^ â bronco
busting, roping steers, and all the
other daring things that "bucaros"
dare to do. After luncheon a drive to
Hollister la on the cards, and then the
journey homeward, arriving in town at
10 d. in. â¢ .
The cost of the trip, including hotel
expenses and transportation, will be
$6 â and hundreds of knights and their
ladles are arranging to make the pil
grimage. \u25a0
To such as will be privileged to stand
beneath the sanctuary reared by the
saintly Lasuen over a century ago, may
the seed be sown' of patriotism â the
kind that will bear fruit; and that
when they come back, they will Join
hands with the Landmarks League in
Its earnest endeavor to save these
splendid old Missionsâ America's no
blest heirlooms â from destruction.
And then will the pilgrimage not
have been In vain.

ARRIVES HERE
Going to Washington to Ask
Aid in Securing Free
dom for Hermit Kingdom
WILL VISIT/ PRESIDENT
Commissioner Yoon Hopes to
Induce Japan : to Eventu
ally- Relinquish; Control
Among the arrivals on. the steamship
Alameda yesterday was P. . K. Yoon, a
Korean convert to Methodism, who Is on
his way to Washington- 'with a view : of
interesting the United States in the fu
ture welfare of the Hermit Kingdom, and
if possible to obtain from the peace com
missioners from Japan an assurance of
future freedom for his country. Yoon,
who was educated in a Methodist mis
sion in Korea and speaks â¢ English with
fluency, carries with him a letter, of in
troduction from Secretary/ Taft to Presi
dent Roosevelt, which he hopes >wiU aid
him in securing from the President full
consideration of. the cause in which he
is patriotically interested.
He comes to this country as the rep
resentative of 7000 Koreans living in
Hawaii, who, while having a very friendly
feeling for Japan, and keenly appreciat
ing what that neighboring nation "has
aone for them, believe that the time is
not far off when the Koreans will be
able to properly govern themselves and
with this prospect in, view. they hope to
persuade Japan to give their country its
freedom. The matter was recently agitated
in Hawaii among the Korean residents,
and in their deliberations Yoon took . an
active part. When the Taft party arriv
ed in Honolulu Yoon was afforded an op
portunity of seeing the Secretary and
conversed with him relative to Korea.
In the end- Secretary Taft gave Yoon a
letter . to President Roosevelt. Discus
sing his mission yesterday at the Occi
dental Hotel, Yoon said: y.
I am very hopeful that I will be able to
accomplish good results during my. visit to
Washington. From what I was able to glean
during my talk with Secretary Taft I am
satisfied that President Roosevelt \u25a0 will use
his best efforts to assist Korea in her plans
for future freedom. While we have no com
plaint to make of the manner In which , our
ccuntry has been treated by Japan our peo
ple feel that after a term of years Janan
\u25a0can justly withdraw her influence and give
us a chance to work out our own problems
ot self-government. We want our independ
ence. It .may come in ten, possibly in fifteen
or probably in twenty years. What we want
now U some definite assurance from Japan,
and It may be obtained through her com
missioners to the approaching peace confer
ence that she will eventually discontinue to
appeft herself on Korean soil. The United
States can aid us in this effort and that is
one of my purposes In going to Washington.

GETTING READY
FOR BIG FIGHT
Stockholders of Montana-
Tonopah Mine at Onts Over
a Question of Dividends
TO MEET AT SALT LAKE
Charles E. ICnox and Malcbm
'Macdonaldy -Who Are Here,
/Lead Contending Forces
Charles E. Knox and Malcom Macdon
ald of Nevada, who , have entered into
a bitter fight for the control of the Mon
tana-Toriopah Mining Company, one of
the /richest properties "In the Sagebrush
State, have . arrived In this city and are
busily preparing for a test of strength
at the coming meeting of * the company
which will be held in Salt Lake City on
September 12.
Knox, who is president of the company,
is at" the Palace Hotel, while Macdonald,
who holds a large block of stock and is
the recognized leader of the minority
stockholders, "is registered at the St.
Francis Hotel. The strife between the
two men and their associates has awak
ened widespread ! interest among mining
men throughout Nevada, where the pro
gress of ' development 'in the Montana-
Tonopah mines is- watched with much
concern. . . ....
The present trouble had Its origin in
the demand of a'nuinber of small stock
.holders.upon President Knox. to declare a
dividend, a proposition to" which Knox
and the majority of the directors de
murred to on several grounds. As a re
sult of division of sentiment on this ques
tion the stockholders are now allied with
either President Knox or Macdonald and
are impatiently awaiting the coming elec
tion in Salt Lake City. .With Knox in
the present trouble are such prominent
men as United States Senator George
Nixon of Nevada, %R.% R. P. Dunlop of Kan
sas City, George Badgett and Charles
Morris of Montana, The latter has been
closely identified with the management of
the company. .
On Macdonald's side are George Bart
lett. who is also In this city, and A. C
Ellis and W. H. Dixon of Salt Lake City.
The latter claim that they will be ab'.e
to make ; a satisfactory showing of
strength at the coming meeting in Salt.
Lake City, but their opponents declare
that' of the 825,000 shares of stock''is
sued they have control of 600,000 shares
for the purpose of holding , their own at
the election. Seemingly Knox's support
ers have taken side's' with him on the
grounds;, that he is a conservative man
and is endeavoring to place the mining
property on a- sound footing. It is claim
ed that his refusal to favor the payment
of a dividend, notwithstanding that the
mine is producing well, was" due to the
fact that he' regards the time too early
for dividends and insists on turning ail
the mine revenue back into the treasury
until the latter has a big surplus and the |
mine has been more fully equipped. It ,
has been carefully estimated by a . num- !
ber of prominent mining engineers, wno
have Inspected the Montana-Tonopah
mine, that it Is worth in the neighbor
hood of $10,000,000 and this fabulous value;
placed on the comparatively newly de- ;
veloped j property^-naturally stimulates
public interest"; in Nevada over the pres
ent light among its stockholders.

AUTOMOBILIST ATTACKS MAX
WHOM HE JUST RAX DOWX
J. de Leon Suffer* Injury at Hands of
an Alleged Capitalist, Carlton
H. Wall.
Because an automobillst dashed
around the corner of Montgomery and
Bush streets at an apparently unwar
ranted rate of speed yesterday after
noon he struck the horse and wagon
of J. de Leon and then, slowing down,
he leaped from his machine, mounted
the wagon of the unfortunate man and
severely beat him about the head. The
automobilist was Carlton H. "Wall, who,
after hi 3 arrest, told the police that
he was a capitalist living at the St.
Francis Hotel, and the man Injured Is a
driver employed by .A. Merle & Co.
Wall was released on ball shortly after
his arrival at the City Prison. Inquiry
proved that he did not live at the Sti
Francis Hotel. He is charged with as
sault and battery and malicious-mis
chief.
De Leon lies on his cot in his room
at 28 Ninth street, moaning with the
pain from his hurts. Across his cheek
is a deep cut. the result of the hard
blow delivered by his assailant. He
claims that he was in no way to blame,
but that Wall was driving faster than
the speed law allowed and in" turning
followed* the wrong side of the street.
He says that "the attack was unpro
voked and that he had no chance to
defend himself. The case will be heard
by Judge Mogan to-day.

Although Police Are Pres
ent, Betting Goes On at
St. Louis Just the Same
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS,, July 25.â Although the St.
Louis Police were present at the track,
following the second race today, betting
went on interrupedly among those known
to the hand book men who mixed among
the 4000 persons present. The police ar
rested ten men and Bent them to the city,
where they were immediately released
because of lack of jurisdiction. Marlin
wae the only winning favorite.
A rumor that armed resistance might
be encountered caused a patrol wagon
bearing a number of riot guns to.be
>>Â«*nt to the scene, but beyond twelve
officers shouldering guns and telling tha
crowd of spectators around the entrance
to stand aside, the guns were not made
use of.
Earlier in the day Detectives Killian
and Ciibanne, who for several days past
attended the race track at the request
of Governor Folk for the purppse of
gathering evidence, secured warrants
for the arrest of six men on a charge
of having violated the anti-pool selling
law. These warrants were placed In
the hands of Sheriff Herpet of St. Louis
County for service.
Not until after the second race did
the police pppear, and then In a body
they marched through the. open gate
way Into the race track. Chief of Po
lice Xioly had Issued orders to arrest
the six men for whom warrants had
be*n insued on sight and Mark Gum
perts, who was acquitted at Clayton
yesterday on the charge of having
regi^tereh bets. John Flynn, William
Slppy. Doro Silver, Frank Shannon and
Christian Brockmiller were taken Into
custody.
Sheriff Herpel entered protest that
he held warrants for the custody of the
first six mentioned and declared that
they should be turned over to him.
Chief Kiel: upheld him in this protest
and the six men were given Into the
custody of Sheriff Herpel's deputies at
the Four Courts and taken to Clayton,
in St. Louis County, where they secured
bonds. The other five men were locked
up tt the Four Courts police station
and, while no specific oharges were
placed against them, they were slated
"Hold for the Chief."

AMATEUR CLUBS
UNDER THE BAN
William Greer Harrison Is
Up in- Arms Against Admit
ting Them to Association
ATHLETIC LEADER HERE
James E. Sullivan Arrives
En Route to Judge Events
at the Portland Exposition
Indications point :to another . war be
tween ; the amateur fight clubs of this
city and the Pacific Amateur Association.
Although the clubs were given some en
couragement; at the last meeting, of - the
executive board, President .William Greer
Harrison of the -Olympic Club came out
yesterday with the statement that the
clubs will never get back into the- # fold
as long as he has anything to say con
cerning the matter.
The ' arrival/ in this city last night . of
James E. Sullivan, secretary'bf the Amer
ican Athletic Union, may also lend some
bearing to the case, and it is likely that
Sullivan will be asked to Join in the con
troversy | before j he ; leaves for Portland.
Should . Sullivan â¢ show a disposition to
take a stand against the fight clubs it is
likely that their fate will bÂ« sealed for
all time. -, : . ' . - v
; Harrison has : long been an enemy : of
the so-called amateur boxing game, but it
was~ supposed. 'he had â been won over
during the last few months. But when
he came out yesterday with the strong
denial of this and! promised to do all in
his power to keep the clubs out of the
fold it changed the aspect considerably.
Sullivan's i arrival here last night was
quite an event at -the Olympic Club. The
secretary of the Athletic Union was dined
there by Max Rosenfeld, and after din
ner waa shown around the place. He
was well pleased with the home of the
winged "O," stating it was one of the
finest clubs he had ever seen.
Sullivan will remain in this city till
Friday, when he leaves for Portland,
there to act as an official In the Lewis
and Clark athletic events. While there
he will be the guest of the Olympic Club,
and will spend his time in viewing j the
sights of the city.
Sullivan says that athletes from all over
the country will be seen in action at
Portland at the big meets to be held
there. He says the men In the East were
very anxious concerning the northern
track. He wired to find out all particu
lars concernlng.it, and was Informed that
it was constructed on natural clay and
was very fast.
NEIL MEETS TENNY NEXT
FRIDAY NIGHT AT COLMA
Amateur Is Expected to Put Up a Rat
tling Good Fight Against Former '
Champion. >
, Frankle Neil and; Harry Tenny, who
are billed for the star event at Colraa
on Friday night, are putting on the fin
ishing'touches to their \u25a0 training and
will go into -the ring In the pink of
condition. Neil has not thought for a
moment that because he was. meeting
a boy., just out, of the amateur ranks
he was ; up against an easy game, but
has been training as hard as he ever
did In his life.
It may be well for Neil that he has
trained conscientiously, for from the
reports , that come from Tenny's camp
there will be some hard fighting to do
before he is beaten. Those who have
been out at the beach and seen Harry
work have riiaryeled at the ; speed he
shows and also Vat his wonderful hit
ting powers.. They figure that he- has
the knockout blow and he has proved
this . in his amateur , bouts by < putting
thirty- two of his opponents to sleep in
less than four rounds each.
There will be a good crowd out to
see these two and they will also see a
fast contest when Joe Tteilly and
North Side Jack O'Brien ; hook up.
These boys are billed to mix it for" ten
rounds as a preliminary to the | main
event. , \u0084:.'" : ...;\u25a0 '. \
Following .the Nell-Tenny match, just
a week later, will come the bout that
the sports are already talking of as
one of the best that California has seen
for many days. This contest is the one
between Jimmy, Gardner . and Rufe
Turner. The Stockton sports are sure
to make the' negro boy a strong favor
lte in the betting, while. on the other
hand, there will be plenty of Gardner
money, in sight, as he has beaten some
of the very .best men In the ! business.
He 'is the only white boy able to put
up a good fight that has been found
willing to meet the black wonder and
that he expects to put ; him away is
evidenced by ; the \u25a0 fact that he had the
purse split so that the loser Is to get
but 1 5 per cent. .

. Whenever Bobby Keefa -Is carded to
climb on top of the mound and shoot 'em
at the Seals, Uncle Hank generally makes
a high sign at himself and kisses victory
good bye. Yesterday afternoon when the
Seals trotted out against the Tigers on
the battle field at Oakland. It seemed
in before' the game had warmed up. for
Keefe wore -the same old smlla and had
the same old curves.
It was the beginning of the most im
portant series of the first half and when
It -was ended, every one knew that San
Francisco will have to be content with
second money. this time at least. From
the time the first bail was pitched the
Seals never figured, while the Tigers were
fighting all, the time and 'ready to make
runs at any old moment. They earned
two of the four they sent through.
Keefe was probably anxious to keep up
his reputation of making monkeys out of
the natives and he sure did succeed in
his efforts. The best they got was three
hits. Not a man walked and up to the
ninth spasm the two men who hit safely
were the only ones to get a place on the
sacks. During the last spasm a couple
of. errors and a' hit helped out and the
Seals had another one on the list that
died.
The Tigers played rattling good baseball
and . in that way managed to get j away
with the game.- Mike Lynch was there
with' three blngles and two of them helped
men over the pan; Doyle slapped the
leather safely twice and- had there been
needs of more hits It Is very likely every
other member of the team would have re
sponded with. blngles.
The Tigers got â their first one in the
sixth when Mike Lynch swung through-to
center, scoring Eagan from second base.
In the seventh, two boots by Gochnauer
and Irwln put a couple of Tigers on the
lines. Again Mike Lynch came through
with a drive and the total was swelled to
two. In the ninth, Casey bingled and
Graham laid down a nice bunt. Doyle
doubled to left and Sheenhan singled to
the same spot, making it four all for Ta

San Franriseo Branch S Ueale St.ALAMEDA MAKES RECORD RUN
BEATING THE MANCHURIA.
Gains .2 Hours on Big Pacific Mail Liner
Between Here. and. Honolulu.
Crews of Two Shipwrecked Danish
Barks Arrive From the South Seas.
Much has been said and written about
the Oceanic Steamship Company's fa
mous twin liners, Alameda and Marl
posa. When they carried the Australian
mail they kept to their schedules with
the sincerity of chronometers, and they
have never done any lagging behind since.
The Mariposa was given a severe trial a
few weeks ago by a naval board and
quallfled as an auxiliary cruiser^ with two
knots more speed than Uncle Sam*3 re
quirement*. Now comes the Alameda,
which arrived yesterday from Honolulu,
with a new record made on the outward
passage. The Alameda left here an hour
ahead of the liner Manchuria. The Man
churia had on board the Taf t party. She
was clean from the drydock and out to
make a record. But the little old Ala
meda reached Honolulu two and a half
hours ahead of her big rival, beating her
actual time one and a half hours. The
Alameda's contract speed was fourteen
knots, and her Urst trial trip showed
she could do it. On the last run to Hono
lulu the frequently attained a speed of
sixteen knots. She made the run in five
days and thirteen hours. The change
from coal to liquid fuel added somewhat
to the Alameda's fleetness, and her en
gines never worked more smoothly than
they do now. When the Postomce De
partment wishes an example of a perfect
mail-carrying service it refers to the rec
ord made by the Alameda and Mariposa
on the run between here and the Anti
podes. When marine architects talk of
famous successes in their line they say,
"Lcok at the .iiameda and the Mari
posa." and when marine engineers are
tilling of record-breaking achievements
they never fail to call attention to the
engines of these two famous twins as
tampies of perfection in the building and
care of marine machinery.
The Alameda brought fifty-three pas
sengers and 547 in the steerage. Of the
latter 3CK> were Japanese. She brought
1350 tons of cargo.
Among the Alameda's passengers were
the two captains and eleven of the crews
of the two Norwegian barks wrecked
last May on Maiden Island. Captain D.
Danielson and Captain T. Larsen com
manded, respectively, the barks Salamis
and Victor. The Salamis was an iron
vessel. The Victor's hull was wooden.
They were loading phosphate at Maiden
Island, and during a gale on May 19 were
driven ashore. All hands landed with
out difficulty, but the vessels were totally
wrecked. The Victor . had Just com
menced to load, but the Salamis had a
full cargo on board and would have been
et sea in a few days longer.
On provisions saved from the wrecks
both crews lived in comparative comfort
until June 11. when the 6Chooner Mat
thew Turner came along, took the ship
wrecked mariners on board and landed
them at Honolulu, where they waited for
the Alameda.
Among the Alameda's passengers were
the following:

Makes Demand on Treasurer

APOLOGIZES FOE LETTER
Says He Writes Unwillingly.
\u25a0 Then Asks 'City Attorney
How to Get Back Coin
Two communications were sent from the
Mayor's office yesterday afternoonâ one
to Treasurer John E. McDougald, re
questing that he pay -to thq city \the
full sums of $15,590 08, the amount paid
illegally on the check of Embezzler E. J.
Smith, late Tax Collector, and of ?15,
20S S5, alleged to be unauthorized. and Ille
gal disbursements and Illegal . commis
sions; the other to Percy V. Long, ask
ing legal advice on the collection of these
amounts. The letters are as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. July 25.' 1905.
Hon. :John EC McDougald, Treasurer â Dear
Sir: As even my kindliest acts are - being
misconstrued and distorted and myself sub
jected to undeserved criticism for manifest
ing the most friendly, and sympathetic spirit,
I am compelled, much against my personal in
clination, to make demand upon you for im
mediate restitution to the treasury of the city
and county of San Francisco of the full sum
of $15,590 08, unlawfully, paid out by your
office upon the personal â¢ check of E. J. Smith,
late Tax Collector. By reason of such â¢ pay
ment on April 20, 1905, there has been for
three months a deficit in the treasury; under
the law there Is now a defalcation in your
office, and- you and your bondsmen are In de
fault to the extent of the moneys so paid out
and not reimbursed.
Knowing that you have been making earnest
effort to gather together sufficient money to
cover this default. I have been more than
willing to -give you all reasonable 'time to
make the amount good, especially as the
defalcation was due to negligence â¢ and not to
criminal intent, but three months have now
elapsed and defalcation In your office still
exists.
The law makes' no distinction in this case
as to the intent with which the default was
created, and the foreman the .Grand Jury
will probably denounce your failure to return
the money as malfeasance on my part. . I
therefore again ask of you to turn this money
Into the treasury at once, before any proceed
ings shall be taken.
In this connection. l herewith submit to your
consideration the following law especially
called to- my notice last ""-Majr by Foreman
Andrews of the Grand Jury:
Section 1 chapter I. article IV of the char
ter provides: "When any official defalcation
â¢ â¢ â¢ or official misconduct shall come to
his knowledge, the Mayor shall suspend the
delinquent officer or person from office pending
an official investigation."
Section 424 of the Penal Code provides:
"Each officer of this State, or of any county,
city, town or district of this State, and every
other person charged with the receipt, safe
keeping, â¢ tranter or disbursement of public
moneys, who either: â¢
"1. Without authority of law appropriates
the same, or any portion thereof, to his own
use. or to the use of another; or.
"2. Loans the same or any portion thereof,
or having the possession or control of any
public money, makes a profit out of, or uses
the same for any purpose not authorized by
law; or.
. "3. Falls to keep the same In his possession
until disbursed or paid out by authority of
law; or.
"4. Unlawfully deposits the same or any
portion thereof In any bank, or with any bank
er or other person; or, r r -.'\ \u0084
"5." Changes or converts any portion thereof
from coin Into currency. l or from currency Into
coin, \u25a0or other currency without authority of
law is punishable by imprisonment in the State
prison for not less than one nor more than
ten years and is disqualified 'from holding any
office In "this State." â¢. -
Section 425 of the Penal Code . provides:
"Every officer charged with the receipt, .safe
keeping or disbursement of public moneys who
neglects or 'fails' -to keep any pay over the
same in- the- manner prescribed by-law"' is
guilty of felony." -.; Â»\u25a0.-'\u25a0-,-â¢:.Â»,â¢>\u25a0>- .c â¢* ;
Section .661 of the t Penal Code provides as
follows :.-.:. "In addition to the penalty affixed
by express terms' to' every neglect or violation
of official duty on Ihe part of public officers.
State, county, city or township, where it Is
not so expressly provided, they may, in the
discretion of the' court, , be removed from
office." 'â¢' '"' " \u25a0 -". '
SOME CHARTER PROVISIONS.
Section 2, chapter 111, article IV, of the
charter provides : â¢
"The Treasurer shall receive and. safely keep
all moneys which shall' be paid Into the
treasury. He shall not lend. . exchange, use. nor
deposit the tame, or any part thereof, to or
with any bank, banker or person ; nor pay out
any part of such moneys, nor allow the same
to pass out of his personal custody, except upon
demands authorized by, law or this charter,
and after they shall have been approved by the
-Auditor."" ' â¢\u25a0â¢â¢\u25a0\u25a0.â¢
"If he violates any of the provisions of this
section be shall be guilty of misconduct In
office and be liable to removal therefrom, and
be proceeded against accordingly."
Under a strict construction of the laws cited,
for the paying out of the money and your fail
ure to replace the " same, a prosecution for
felony may He, -it- matters not" how innocent
thÂ« intent. '
The experts who have examined the affairs
of your office also report a deficit In your ac
counts of $15,20885, \u25a0 said to have arisen as
follows: $9935 70' through unauthorized and
lllÂ«gal disbursements by your office of which
no account appears in the books of tbe Audi
tor and which la claimed to have been taken
out of the treasury by you without approved
demands and is claimed to have been unauthor
izedly charged to "attorney's .fees for Arthur
Fisk" for collection of collateral inheritance
taxes, no record of which payments appears in
the Auditor's office, and $5273 15' alleged to be
held out and not entered In your books on the
pretense that said sum belongs to you per
sonally as commissions on the collection of
such collateral Inheritance tax. a pretense and
contention which has long since been adverse
ly adjudeed both by the Superior courts and
the Supreme Court of the State.

nance of a, hospital service. Although no'
decision has yet been, arrived at, and.
probably will not until the matter has
been thoroughly discussed with Presi
dent Harriman and possibly the employes
themselves, it is understood that the
heads of the railroad, are In favor of
raising the monthly dues, regarding such
a move' aÂ£ necessary f.or the future wel-,
fare of the hospital department.
The plan most favored by the officials
is the establishment of a graduating
scale of dues, Instead of 50 cents for all
employes. This plan is to impose, upon
all men receiving less than $100 a month
dues in the sum of 50 cents: for men re
ceiving over $100 and less than $200 a 75,
cents due, and above $200 the sum of $L.
Although a general supposition has ex
isted for years that the tax Imposed upon
employes of the Southern Pacific Com-!
pany was more than ample to meet the (
requirements of the hospital department,:
and that the company was really enjoy
ing the -use of a large surplus of funds
from this monthly revenue, the annual;
report of Chief Surgeon Alnsworth for
last year shows that there was- a slight
deficit in the hospital account, which the
company made up by a special contribu
tion. And it has been further developed
that the company annually contributes as.
its share toward the fund the sum of
$25,000. Last year the dues paid In by'
the employes amounted to $110,000.
The increased mileage of the Southern
Pacific Company lately is materially in
creasing the usefulness of the hospital
department and necessarily increasing the
expense attending" the care of eick and
injured employes. In view of this, fact
General Manager Calvin and the chief
surgeon, who have been giving the mat
ter much serious thought, foresee recur
ring deficits, if the dues are not raised.
and they are trying to devise some rea
sonable solution to meet such* a possi
bility.
TELLS OF FIGHT FOR
POLITICAL PURITY
Professor Graham Taylor
Speaks at People's Place
Settlement House.
Professor Graham Taylor, D. D. Lli
.p., founder.j^pd .Â£&^the^Chlcaso
Commons, and a member of the facility
of the Chicago "Theological ."Senilhtiry,
w\'is.xÂ«ncu red a welcome .and reception
last-night by the. People's _Place at th.c
Settlement House, 900 Lombard street.
The distinguished* guest delivered, an
addrfss brimful; of interest.;, .* \ ly.i,
Ho spoke of the influences which "bet
tered municipal conditions in Chicago,
of the I: tile band, who had ousted tho
"gang" and elected clean men. He told
of the exposed labor leaders who
falsely led the employes into strikca'in
Chicago and of the corrupted agents of
tho emnJoyer.
Pr< fef ior Taylor explained that Set
'tiements arc centers where men and
women meet together to enjoy social
reciprocity. There was no . religious
line drawn, he said. In Chicago they
hail Â«m cry dyj.omin:>.l lon represente-l.
"No fees of any kind shall be retained by him
(the Treasurer),' but the same, from whatso
ever source received or derived, shall be paid
by him into the treasury."
As the said sum of $15,208 85 has never been
paid Into the treasury in accordance . with the
charter, and as the, alleged payment of said
attorney's fees without approved demands, or at
all, is unauthorized by the charter. I am
advised that you are chargeable with a fur
ther deficit of $15,203 85, demand for tha im
mediate reimbursement of which ..to. the , city
treasury is hereby made.
Regretting the necessity which compels this
communication, I am very sincerely yours,
' E. E. ECHMITZ,
Mayor of tho City and County of San Fran
cisco.
Percy V. Long, Esq., City Attorney â Dear
Sir: Pursuant to section 2. chapter 11, article
V of the charter I hereby request your opinion
and advice on the following subjects:
Firstâ Tho late Tax Collector, E. J. Smith.
on or about April 20, 1905, embezzled from
the city a large amount of money, which
neither ha nor his- bondsmen have repaid to
the city. . -
ASKS HOW TO PROCEED.
What proceedings, If any, are necessary on
my cart or on the part of any other public
official of the city to force the Immediate re
imbursement to the city of the moneys co em
bezzled? \u25a0 â¢ . * â¢' \u25a0 .. â¢â¢ \u25a0
If no preliminary steps are required. I re
spectfully Instruct you to commence immediate
action to recover said \u25a0 moneys on behalf of
the city and county of San Francisco.
Second â On or about April 20, 1905, John E.
McDougald, Treasurer of the. city and county
of San Francisco, paid to said E. J. Smith
on his personal check $15,500 08.
I am advised that such payment was in con
travention of eectlon 2, chapter 111, article IV
of tbe charter and of sections 424 and 425 of
the Penal Code, that such payment under the
law and failure to reimburse the same con
stitutes official defalcation and Is an official
felony. - :
I refer you also to section 1, chanter I,
article IV of the charter. Based on the Day
ment of said check, a deficit still exists in the
funds of the Treasurer. 'Foreman Andrews of
the Grand Jury last Friday especially called
my attention to ' the provisions of .- law . above
cited with reference to the custody . of public
moneys by city \u25a0 officials, and practically
claimed that the Mayor Is officially responsible
for the acts and omissions of all other city
officials. . .
'\u25a0 I hereby requeot your opinion and advice
aa to the proper, course to bo pursued by the
Mayor and *. Board of Supervisors or. by any
other public : officer in this connection, and to
have said funds restored, respectfully sub
mitting at the same' time that in my opinion
there was no guilty Intent, but only careless
ness and neglect \u25a0on the part of the Treas
urer In making: the payment aforesaid. .
. Third â Experts j who > have examined Treas
urer McDougald's , accounts report that out. of
the -collateral Inheritance - taxes collected by
him' he has failed : to pay into the treasury
$8935 70, which he Claims to have paid as at
torneys' . fees -on account of ' the collection of
eald taxes, without approved -or other demand
on the treasury, no account of â¢ which pay
ments-appears In : the Auditor's office, and
that >' he - has 3 further - held â¢ out the- sum of
$5273 15 \u25a0 claimed as his commission for : col
lecting euch taxes. ;â¢ l - : ' â¢ <
r I am advised, that under section 2, chapter
HI, article IV, of the charter, and under sec
tion 34 of article XVI. as well as under the de
cisions; In' Brooks,; Treasurer, vs. :City and

A LETTER FROM A PATIEXT.
San Francisco. Cal.. Feb. 20. 1903.
During an Illness with which I have suf-
fered from heart and stomach trouble for
nearly eight years I have treated with'
prominent physicians In Los -Angeles. San
Francisco and Seattle. They failed to cure
or even dlacrose my case. My condition
gradually became worse, until I was pro-
nounced Incurable by them. I was in a
low state, scarcely able to stand, when I
decided as a last resort to try Chinese
treatment and consulted with Dr. Won?
Him of 607 Geary street. He diagnosed
my case by the simple feeling of tbe
pulse, describing every symptom of my af-
fliction. I took his Herb medicine, when
_I Immediately began to Improve. After
'\u25a0continuing his treatment -for- flvt months!
became a well â¢ woman. . - â¢ .

The "Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. O. McAdle, section
director of the c'Omtte and crop service of
the Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The weather during- the week was warm
t-.i clear in the interior aad cool, cloudy and
foggy la the coast districts. Field fires de
â¢rroyed sÂ«veral hundred acres of grain and
feed in Caiaveras and Gleaa counties, and
icrest tres caused creat damage in Mendociaa
County.
Grtln harvest Is completed in some sections
and progreealEg in others. The yield and
nssJtty of wheat, barley a,nd oats are much
below esr:y estimates aad ia some places the
Â«ra:n is said to be not worth harvesting. The
fcey crop is very large la nearly all sections
and the Quality excellent. Heps are making
fair progress, but the present outlook is not
catisfactory. Beans are in bloom and glv*
Frorclse of a heavy crop. Sugar beet harvest
cor.ti-ues. Corn is in good condition and
ttÂ«?j* wÂ»ji be an *verÂ»*Â« crop.
The midsummer varieties of deciduous fruit*
ere ripening rapidly end fair crops are being
tattered. Pears are yielding better than ex
p^tted ar.d rluras are fully up to average.
Peacheg and prunes ere light in some sections
f.r. i fair in others. Grapes were somewhat
lrjured by the recent hot weather, but still
five vail cations ef a large crop. Citrus fruits
ere in good condition.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â CIear weather
prevailed during the week and conditions were
Xavorabi* fcr crops. In the southern pert of
the valley the temperature continued slightly
t-elow the normal, bat high temperature pre
vailed nearly all the week in the northern
section. Several hundred acres of grain were
destroyed by fire in Glenn County. Harvest
ing, threshing- and hay baling are progress
ing rapld'.y and there is no change since tht
last report as to yield and quality. Hops
made good growth and la some, places there
is a prospect for a large crop. Beans and
corn are looking well and will yield fair
crops. Fruit picking, canning and drying are
In progress. Eerly peaches are nearly all
rs the red; ihe crop is light and of poor quality.
P*2rs are- riper-ing rapidly and Bartletts and
Vftrly Crawfords are in market. Plums ar*
B -elding- a . good crop in some sections, but
' ere damaged by heat. Grapes are ripenir-g
end give promise of a large yield. Oranges,
lemons and olives are in good condition.
COA6T AND BAY SECTIONS. â Clear, warm
weather prevailed during the week in the In
terior aad cool cloudy and foggy weather
aJor-g the coaet. Conditions were generally
favorable fcr the growth of crops and fruit
drying. Wheat harvest 1c completed in some
sections and progressing rapidly in others;
the yield -Is better than expected, but below
average. Barley is yielding a good crop and
otts are light. The hay crop is very larse
ar.d of excellent quality; baling is progress
irg-. Kops are In fair condition, but the out
lock is that the yield will fall below average
ir. come places. Beans, corn and vegetables
ere doinr well. Grapes were somewhat dam
eced by recent hot weather, but there will
prcbabiy be a large crop In most -places.
BarUett pears are ripening; they are of good
euality and .the yield will be about average.
The rÂ«*ca crop is light. Prunes will be light
In sorce sections and nearly average in others.
Almonds a.r.d walnuts were slightly injured
toy the heat. Oranges at Cloverdale are in
arooc condition.
SAX JOAQUIN VALLEY. â The weather
iurlng the past week was clear ar.d warm.
These csÃdltlocs were very favorable for har-
Ti?etlr.g KTtJn and maturing and drying fruit.
The grain harvest is about completed: the
y>:a way light and the quality below the
average. Several thousand acres of grain and
feed were destroyed by fire in Calaveras
County. Peaches are ripealoe rapidly and
be'-g shipped in larre quantities to the can
neries end dryers. The prune crop will be
light Heaw shipments of watermelons con
tinue. The "grape crop will be good: table
rrcpes are ripenlne sxd small shipments are
being made. Raisin grapes are making good
progress. Almonds will yield a. good crop.
Citrus fruits are in good condition. Feed Is
plentiful aad ftock Is healthy and la rood
CALTFOR-VlAâ Clear days acd
cloudy or foggy eights prevailed In the coast
districts Â«j generally clear, warm weather
in the interior. The temperature continues
cctnewhat below normal and the cool wathei
â¢ is unfavcrab-.e for growing crops except bea^-s
end *upar becte. Beans are ia bloom at Santa
Maria ar.4 the outlook Is good for a r.eavy
TSep. Sucar beets are yielding unusually well
13d factorial are running night and day. Btr
ey j* a full aversxe crop. Oats, are llrht
and of pocr quality. Wheat Js above average
exd the hay crop Is the best for several year*.
St:rll fruit* arid melons are backward, owing
to cool weather. Apricot drying Is progrew
!~e Grepes ere In good condition and p.v4

NEW TORK. July 25.â T0-day's stock mar
krt had clearly enough fallen back- Into the
hands of the smaller professional element,
which trades at the beard room day in and
Czy out the year round, as against the ele-
ment wMch embarks in extensive speculative
cainpa:gT.s with intervals away from the stock
market. The latter clement is indulging^ in
vaca.ticiÂ» idleness at this .period. Xhe general;
public shows no stsn of interest in the mar
ket. The buying movement of . Monday to
cover short contracts put out on Saturday
was carried^ over into-* he early part of to
day and email speculative panics operated, for*
an advance Id one or two â¢ stocks in which
there Tire-re a plausible motive for an advance.
R.eai!ng â¢ rebounded sharply from Saturday's
attack owing to -the disclaimers publicly ex
pressed by the president of the United Minft.'
Workers of the alleged . danger, of, a strike. 5
The United States Steel 6tockÂ» were,taken io
ar.tlcli'ation of a stro.ng showing* to'be' made:
by the nuartcrly report of nt-t earnings, which
was not expected to-be published, . however,
until after the closing of the market. The;
bear attack of last Saturday is ..cynically' at
tributed in the comtnent current about the.
Stork Exchange to the account â¢ofâ¢ & â¢ large
bucketJfcop interest, ..the customers of which
had made extensive commitments on the long
side, entailing the deposit of marginal security
in the hands of the bucketebops. Then demand
for stocks was not extended largely beyond the
neefls of the short sellers" of last week. The
normal uncertainty of crop, estimates at this
season of the year and the Irregular., movement
of stocks likely -to result Beem to discourage,
activity. The recovery in the price of wheat
to-day was accompanied by some trivial black
rust reports from Washington wheat regions..
The glaring discrepancy between the tenor of
thtse reports and those of the Weather Bureau
crop bulletin did not deprive of influence both
in the wheat and stock markets and the late
reaction In stocks waa largely attributed to
this cause. Reports fr>m- the West apoke of
a hardening tendency In the money market
there and the expectation of higher rates
within a short time owing to the loaned-up
condition of -<he banks and the prospect ai
active business conditions as the. crops are
harvested. The New York money market was
called easy, but principally from the lightness
of the demand, the funds offering showing' no
notable increase In \-olume. The stock mar
ket of the latter part of- the day fe-11 into a
state cf neglect, but the decline was .partly
recovered and the closing was steady. Total
sales, par value, $1,514,000.
United States bend* were unchanged on call.

Fntiire' Grata a ntl Provisions. ''.: .;
CHICAGO, July *25. â Nervousness pervaded ;
the wheat pit- throughout the entire . session.
At the start the market, waa decidedly weak,
initial quotations on September being down
%c to lc at 86%c't0.86%c. Conditions In the
Northwest constituted the chief, source of
weakness. The weather, throughout the Da
kotas and Minnesota is still of a kind to
minimize the danger of spread of black rust,
clear skies prevailing generally over that sec
tion. Another reason for heavy wiling that
prevailed at the opening was found. ln liberal
j arrivals of new . wheat at Chicago.
A decline in the price of wheat at Llver-
I pool was an additional depressing influence.
Toward the end of -the â¢first hour sentiment
changed, tho tone of \ the market becoming
decidedly bullish. The cause was Information
contained in numerous advices from Minne
apolis regarding damage by rust, one of the
reports asserting that samples of wheat from
Manitoba showed signs of the dreaded blight.
While the buying enthusiasm was at its height
a fresh factor of bearish portent became
available. This was the weekly, report of the
Weather. -Bureau commenting -on the condi
tion of Boring sown., wheat. Tho report
claimed that although black rust .had. been
discovered in scattered' districts' no - material'
damage has thus far resulted. Renewed weak
ness followed this announcement, many of the
earlier buyers becoming active sellers. The
market closed weak with price* nearest the
lowest point reached. Final quotations on Sep
tember were S6%@S7c. / -
Corn was somewhat bullish as a result' of
smaller receipts than estimated. September
opened unchanged to %c higher at 54% c to,
54% c. sold between 54% c and 64% c, and.closea
at 54<HÂ®54%c. / \u25a0/
Heavy liquidation caused weakness fi^' the
oats market. . September opened %c lower at
29% c. sold between 25%@29c. and closed at
the lowest iK>int.
Provisions were easy early In the session
on account Of apprehension concerning yellow
fever in the South. At the close, September
pork waa up 7%c at $13 10. Lard was 2%@5c
hlghfrat $7 22%. Ribe were unchanged at
$7 BS(g7S7%.

in the wool market. This is partly the re
sult of the satisfactory opening of the better

view of large sales and Batisfactory conditions
of the goods market, lower prices In thÂ« near
future are not looked for; on the contrary, the
tendency Is believed to be distinctly upward.

per ton for the former and $2Ci?25 for . the
latter. They were also purchasing freely of
Peaches an/1 Bartlett Pears. No. 1 Pears were
quoted at the nominal rate of $60 per ton and
No. 2 stock sold from $20 to $30 as to quality.
Small packages of tree fruits continued to ar
rive freely and there was continued weakness
In Plums and ordinary Peaches. . Choice of

showed some improvement. The Citrus market
was quiet and featureless.

up Curing his cross-examination by Dis
trict Attorney Byington. \u25a0 â¢
Echerf testified that when the pound
wagon drove up Schultze said something,
but witness did not 'catch the exact words.
He flred the shot but could not say whether
it w.as from a .44 or .38 caliber revolver
What made him use the revolver was be
cause he saw Schultze's hand upraised to
\u25a0trlke Murphy on the back and thinking
It vu a knife, as Ex-Poundmaster Irwln
had told him that Schultze bad once
threatened him with a knife, *he pulled
the revolver from the blankets on the
sect and ehot quickly. He did not intend
to hit Schultze, but .wanted to scare him.
HÂ» denied having any conversation with
Murphy and Weintraub as to burying the
.88 caliber revolver. He had heard that
Schultz* had threatend to kill Henry
Dance and Irwln because they impounded
two of his horses, and at that time drew
a knife. He had; heard Irwln and Dance
speaking about^lt^, i { - %
In cross-exaznlntLtlon bÂ« said be ..did not
aim wjth the 'revolver.' ' He picked It
up from the blanket and as he. lifted It
up It went- off.' He dld'not'see a net over
Schultze's head.
Afrthur Stewart Murphy, for the defense
proved a strong witness for the prose
cution.' He detailed the events leading
up to the shooting and the arrangement
as to the hiding of the ' revolver that
Bcherf used. â¢ He , admitted j that he had
testified falsely at the Coroners inquest,
but said , he ' was now telling the truth.
He was cross-examined at . considerable
length by Attorney Coghlan-<forthe de
fense. . ' -
Charles ' A. Ford and Edward Sullivan
were called t* testify that they did not
hear any conversation between Scherf,
Murphy and Weintraub as to burying the
revolver.
Harry O. Irwin, ex-poundmaster, testified
as to having trouble with the Schultzes as
to Impounding two of (their horses about
a year before the murder. One of them
drew a knife, but he did not know which
one. He had talked about it and possi
bly Scherf might have heard him.
Mrs. Adeline Schultze. wife of Aug
ust M. Schultze was called in rebuttal. She
said that one of the two horses impound
ed belonged to her husband. She had
been married for six years and she never
knew her husband to carry a revolver or
knife.
The defense has another witness to ex
amine and the case will go to the Jury
this afternoon.

Scoffs at Search Warrant, and
Rends Officer's Trousers.
She Respects the Court, but Adheres to
Altar Vow to Obey Husband.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Mrs. Christina Wlngrlst, whose chin
denoted firmness of character, informed
Police Judge Conlan that while she
held the laws of this land in great es
teem. In her consideration they were
secondary to the mandates of her hus
band. It was most . unfortunate - that
their machinery and his wishes clashed,
and still more unfortunate , that she
should have been forced to. the test of
manifesting her comparative allegiance.
But when the test was applied she dis
covered that she could not renounce her
altar vow of otredience in order to com
ply with the court order issued by
Judge Cabaniss, niuch as she respected
that worthy magistrate and his official
position. That was why she resented
service of the search warrant and tore
Patrolman Dennan's pantaloons.
It was at Mrs. Wlngrlst's home, 1232
York street, that tne warrant was
scorned and Its holder's nether gar
ments rent. Mrs. Wingrist's tall^ and
loose-Jointed minor son, Oscar, was sus
pected by Mrs. Mary ; White, residing
next door, of having purloined some
wearing apparel and other articles from
her j house and secreted them In his
parents' dwelling, so she laid her case
before Judge' Cabaniss, who issued a
signed and sealed document authorizing
Patrolmen Dennan and Wollweber r to
search the Wingrist residence for the
missing property. When the officers
visited the place of their quest they
were received by Mrs. Wingrist, and,
when their mission had been courteous
ly stated, she told them that' she could
not think of such a- thing as permitting
.them to enter her house during the ab
sence of her husband, who had explicit
ly instructed her to deny admittance to
any male person. After vainly exhauÃt
lng all the suasive argument they could
think of, the men In uniform attempted
forcible entry, but the lady stood true
to her colors and barred the way. It
was while endeavoring to remove her
from his path that Patrolman Dennan
had his trousers ripped from the right
hand side pocket to the knee by one of
her resisting hands. Patrolman Woll
weber would "have, assisted his brother
officer in overpowering the fair obstacle
If Master Oscar had not abruptly ap
peared with a Winchester rifle, which
he handled in a most intimldatory way
until Wollweber disarmed him. Then
both mother and son. were arrested.
"I simply did what my husband had
told me to do," was Mrs. Wingrist's
plea. - * ,
"You are guilty of battery and I will
sentence' you to-morrow," said the
Judge.
Master Oscar was remanded for ex

When she purchased the baby buggy
from the Market-street furniture es
tablishment Mrs. Rena Stefanik paid
$1 60 cash and promised to pay $6 more
In twelve monthly Installments of 50
cents each, and very happy and proud
was she when the vehicle arrived at her
home and she placed her new Infant In
it preparatory to perambulation. Nor
was her happiness lessened by the ad
miring glances which passing pedes
trians of the gentler sex shot at the
buggy and .its dimpled occupant, for
the picture was good to look upon.
With maternal gratification,, therefore,
Mrs. Stefanik shoved the little carriage
along until, about half-an-hour after
she had started, it abruptly broke
down. Fortunately the baby was not
injured by the collapse, but the buggy
was beyond impromptu repair, ao Mrs.
Stefanik hauled It and carried her off
spring back to the place of beginning.
There she left the little one, and from
there she dragged the damaged buggy
back to the store whence she had
bought it.
"I want either a new buggy warranted
not to break down, or return of the
money I paid you for this crippled
thing," said Mrs. Stefanik to the store
manager.
"Tut, tut," was his response; "we
cannot cither replace buggies which
have been broken through careless
handling or pay for the breakage."
"Then," quoth Mrs. Stefanik, "as I
have not much else to engage my time
to-day? baby being well taken care of
at home, I'll Just sit down here and tell
every one who comes in the 'sort of a
game you are running."
And sit down she did and denounce
the business of the house she did until
the management summoned a police
man and ordered her into custody on
the charge of peace disturbance.
Among the witnesses called to testify
for the defense was a ' young man
named W. C. Cunningham, who averred
that he had resigned his position as a
salesman for the complainant so that
he could conscientiously tell the truth.
"Wen, what Is the truth?" inquired
Judge Conlan.
"The truth is that this woman was
shamefully treated," replied Mr. Cun
ningham, "and other persons have
been treated by the same
firm."
Mrs. Stefanik was dismissed. Then
rumor in the corridor had' it: that Mr.
Cunningham's testimony was prompted
less by spirit of philanthropy than de

NON-RESIDENTS
Board of Education Advised
That "Charter Provision
< Does Not ' Apply to Teachers
NEED NOT LIVE IN CITY
Disobedience to Kule Would
Not Affect Those Already
in the School Department
: City Attorney Long yesterday advised
the Board ,of Education that it Is not
bound by the charter provision requiring
city employes to actually reside in the
city and county so far as its employes
are concerned. The opinion is in re
sponse to a query by the board as to its
power to employ or retain persons other
than citizens of the United States and
â¢ non-residents of the city and county.
The opinion says:
The employes oÂ£ the School Department, and
herein are Included all teacners of the depart
ment (Kennedy vs. Board of Education, S2
Cal. 483), are employes of the school district
of the city and county ana not of the munici
pal corporation; the powere of the boards of
education are defined In section 1617 of the
Political Code which reads, in part, â¢as fol
lows: "Seventh â To employ. the teachers . . .
Janitors and other employes of the schools; to
fix and order paid their compensation, unless
same are otherwise prescribed by law." This
section contains no limitation upon thÂ« power
of the board to employ Eucn teachers and,em
ployes and fixes no qualifications upon such
employes necessary to their employment. I
The law prescribes the conditions upon which
one may secure a teacher's certificate. These
conditions being compiled with, a certificate m-
Bues, which entitles the holder to teach. The
board has discretionary power to say who
shall be appointed, but cannot add to the con
ditions imposed by law. . \u25a0
Assuming for the moment that your board
has power to add to the desired qualifications
for teachers and other employes of the de
partment before their appointment. It is clear
that disobeying such a rule would not.be
ground for dismissal and could not therefore
be enforced v upon those already in' the depart
ment, as the â¢ grounds for such dismissal are
clearly defined both in the charter and the
general law. (Charter, article 7, chapter 3,
section 1; Political Coda, uectlon 1791, 1703).
I am of the opinion that tne rule works both
ways, and if the Board of Education is with
out power to add to the grounds for dismissal
It Is also without power to add to the condi
tions of employment, and, therefore, that euch
a requirement as that proposed would be in
valid. â¢

Ocean Shore Company Noti
fies City Engineer to Cut
Out Portion of Boute.
The officials of the Ocean Shore Rail
way Company, which has filed a petition
with the Board of Supervisors for a
franchise to operate a railroad along cer
tain streets with two branch lines, no
tified City Engineer Woodward yesterday
not to prepare plans for the branch
which was -proposed should cross Golden
Gate Park. This notification. Wood
ward says, is tantamount to the aban
donment of the, branch line described.
In its petition for a franchise the Ocean
Shore Company specified the route of
the main line which was to run along the
shore in the county of San Francisco and
then branch off >in two different direc
tions. One ; of these was. to run along
the north line of Lake Merced, thence
to Ocean View,: thence along Islals
Creek and crossing - Mission road and
along Army, street to Twenty-fourth and
Illinois.' Woodward will report on the
route- and construction of this branch.
This branch was % Intended for freight
only.
The other branch. was to run from the
main line across Golden. Gate Park by a
subway, thence along C street to Fulton
and Tenth avenue, and was intended to
carry passengers. The presumed aban
donment of this branch will necessitate
the running* of both passenger and
freight cars along the Ocean View
branch. No notification of the elimina
tion of the park branch has yet been filed
with the Board of Supervisors, which
will consider the petition as soon as
Woodward has filed his report thereon.

that a railroad rate equal to the lowest

DRIVING PARK
Plirchase of Many Entire
Blocks in the Sunset
District Starts Rumor.
LAEGE SUMS INVOLVED
Not Less Than $250,000
Represented in Ilecent
Deals in One Section
A- private driving park may be es
tablished in the .picturesque ,' region
south of Golden Gate Park and well out
toward the beach: Large purchases of
real estate, amounting to $250,000, have
recently .been, made in, the section gen
erally described, between Twenty-sec
ond avenue and the ocean and south of
R street. 'The movement has been so
unusual as to attract .the attention of
all real estate operators. Certain in
dividuals have acquired a dozen entire
blocks on their own account. Some
have been bought in the names of
others. No one is ready to say abso
lutely that a private driving park for
the section in question is assured, but
there is a great deal; of talk in that
direction.
"Among the larger individual purchas
ers is J. M. O'Brien, the carriage manu
facturer. He has bought blocks 1254,
126 C, 1255, 979. 1008. \ 1009, 1010, 1060,
1158, 11&9, 1279, 1181 and possibly oth
ers. Those that are described by num
bers in the foregoing are twelve in all.
People conocted. with the Metropolitan
Improvement Company are buying in
their Individual names. Entire blocks
have been purchased by J. L. Shrader,
J. â¢F. Kennedy, . Alfred D. Bowen and
others. â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0'\u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 ;
Diligent inquiry was made yesterday
among the buyers of blocks concerning
their intentions and the reasons for In
vestment, In. all directions the an
swers were non-committal. One large
concern that is interested as a buyer
intimated that developments might
come to light in another month that
would explain the interest In \u0084the sec
tion now attracting so much attention.
That something unusual Is under way
there Is good reason to believe.
Including 41 blocks that the Sutro
estate has recently agreed to sell, sub
ject to confirmation by the court, not
less than 60 entire blocks have been
put, in the way to change owners In the
last sixty days.

SUGAR RATES
ARE REDUCED
Railroads Cut Their Tariff
Twenty-Two Cents From
Here to Missouri Jtiver
AIDS LOCAL REFINERS
Reduction Grows Out of the
War Between Lines .Run
ning Out of New Orleans
The Southern Pacific and the Santa
Fe companies formally announced yes
terday a reduction in the rate of re
fined sugar between this city and the-
Missouri , Kiver and points in Kansas
and Nebraska from fifty cents to
twenty-eight cents a hundred pounds in
carload lots.
The cut has been made to meet a cut
made by the lines operating between
New Orieans and the same points men
tioned above, and for the purpose of
placing California refiners on an equal
footing with their Southern competi
tors. Recently the lines operating out
of New Orleans, among " them the Illi
nois . Central, the Frisco and several
subsidiary lines of the Southern Pacific,
dissolved their agreement relative to
sugar rates and entered upon a war
that ended a few days ago in the rate
being cut from thirty-two cents to ten
cents a hundred pounds.
As a result the California refiners
found themselves seriously handicapped
In their business and finally appealed
for relief to the lines running out of
this city, with the result that yesterday
the cut was made. The reduction brings
the eastbound rate down to the lowest
point in the history of Western refining,
and, so the railroad officials claim,
makes the handling of sugar from this
State to Eastern points a losing busi
ness. It is probable, however, that the
desired effect will be accomplished in a
few days, when the old rates between
New Orleans and the North will be re
stored and the rates here will then be
raised. '
The normal adjustment of the rate
between San Francisco and the Mis
souri River and points in Kansas and
Nebraska and the rate between New Or
leans and Kansas City was based on the
difference in the cost of raw sugar
shipments from Hawaii. California was
given a rate of fifty cents In view of
the fact that she is closer to "Hawaii
and New Orleans' product was carried
to the large markets for thirty-two
cents. In connection with the cut of
yesterday it was -stated that the low
rate will be applicable to, beet sugar
as well as cane sugar.
