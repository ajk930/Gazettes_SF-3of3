Mrs. Price appeared at the Hall of
Justice about 6 o'clock and asked that
a policeman accompany her to Ala
tneda and aid her to regain the,cus
tody of her offspring. She was told
that her troubles were not police mat
ters and that she would have to swear
to a warrant against Prlc*. Then for
an hour she haunted the corridors of
the Hall and engaged in conversation
â¢with Peter Duffy, an attache. "I will
give any one $1000. who will get; my
little ones back for me; yes, I will give
$10,000 to have them with me again,"
she said.
She was in an excited condition. and
cried hysterically. "I have a gun here,"
Bhe said. Indicating her bosom, "and
I am going over to Alameda to kill
my husband." She wheeled with a sud
den determination and fled frantically
from the building-
The police were notified that' the
woman was armed and Detective,Tay
lor followed her to the ferry, where. he
placed her under arrest The revolver,
fully loaded, was taken from her. She
carried a" grip in which she" had a bun
dle of letters.
She said . that she . and , her., husband
had been separated for" six weeks. *'He

Mrs. Emma Price, wife of William
L. Price, advertising manager of the
Oakland Tribune, came to the Hall of
Justice last night, hysterical and de
termined, and saying that her husband
had kidnaped her two young children,
declared that she intended killing him.
6he was later arrested at the ferry by
Detective Charles Taylor as she was
about to embark on the boat for Ala
meda to carry out her threat. She had
a large revolver concealed in her bos
om and objected strenuously to being
taken Into custody.
"I mutt see my j children, I must see
xny children to-night," the anguished
mother sobbed. Almost crazed with
grief she was taken before Captain
Burnett, who, after interviewing . her,
ordered her locked up on a charge of
carrying a concealed weapon.
Mrs. Price Bald she was worth nearly
$100,000; that Ehe had a summer home
In Boulder Creek, from which the two
children were taken yesterday by thelr
father, and that her mother, Mrs Har
ris, living on Larkin street, was also
wealthy. â¢*
his wife: absent, bV said, 1 and
believing that she; had gone on a spree,
h'e took the children â¢backTwith"; him "to
Oakland, , intending * to bring ; them ;, to
San^ Francisco; to-day ; arid leave! them
in the custody"of their, grandmother." 1 -.
When informed that she would have
to go to Jail for carrying a concealed
weapon, the woman wept, but she did
not remain long in detention, as her
mother sent down and obtained her re
lease on bail. She went to her mother's
home, where she will be guarded; to
seevthat she does not carry out her
threat to kill her husband.
Mrs. Price ' has been married twice.
The two children over whom" the trou
ble occurred are by her present hus
band. She has two sons, one 17 and the
other 23 years of age, by her first hus
band. She and her mother own prop
erty in this city, and are well off. She
married Price about seven vears ago.
When seen at: his home in Oakland
last night, William. I* Price told the
"story of ' h. ls doriiestlc troubles. His
wife had sued him a year ago for "di
vorce on ' account ; "bf; alleged cruelty,
arid he filed'. a Â¦ cross-complaint,'.where
upon legal proceedings .were ' dropped
on each Bide. Mrs. Price has since been
living .mostly < at' Boulder Creek, .where"
her husband went on Friday to see her
and, their children. J, . .;.
with my two children, 4 and 6 years
old. Friday I came to the city to visit
my mother", on Larkin street, and left
the children with the servants. This
morning I received word from my
housekeeper that Mr. Price had been
there and had taken, the children. I
took the first train for. Boulder Creek
and arrived- a few hours after he had
left. I immediately - boarded a return
train and on :my arrival, here sought
the aid of the police. : Finding my ef
forts unavailing/; I > decided to take
steps to regain the: children myself. I
do not ;remember,;that . I said that I
would . shoot Mr. -Price.-.- If I did it was
because I was madâ mad with anguish
and rage."
Mrs. Price burst into tears and ex
citedly paced up and down the detect
ives* office.'- "I must see, my. children
to-night; I must see my children to
night," she moaned.
Mrs. Price exhibited her letters. They
were signed variously, full i of vulgar
and obscene writing and were read by
the police. All concerned the alleged
misconduct of Mrs. Price. She said
they were In her husband's handwrit

MODESTO, Oct. : 23.â The . people of
this vicinity are stirred , up over two
malicious : arid almost â¢ successful at
tempts to wreck Southern Pacific trains
between Modesto and Salida early
Sunday "morning. - At two ; different
places on the mainline ties were piled
on . the track, nearly causing, the de
railment of a ' heavy freight j train ; and
the ; wreck of- the morning Fresno pas
senger. 1 .
' A northbound freight, Â¦Â¦ No. 253, was
several : hours late in passing through
this place Sunday, morning. . When the
train .reached the switch on' the south
Bldft ' of . Salida, five riilles to the north of
,here,':.the saw j/i~ pile . of ties
btt^t4eE^ck.J^l^^r^^ra"ctlon5thV
train was ."checked, and struck the ties
with little force; no damage being done.
;, The . second ."attempt would ' have ' cbst
many j lives if successf uK The : north
bound Fresno, passenger left here' at
7:55 Sunday, morning and, * on account
of the attempt on' the freight train, was
run at* slow speed to Salida. > About j a
mile to the south of Salida the engine
struck a pile of. ties placed on the in-' :
side of and parallel with the rails. The
tender of the /engine was torn off by.
the force of. the impact. The whole
train was jarred and the passengers
were ! greatly alarmed. By almost a
miracle, however, the train kept to the
rails. Arriving at the Salida switch,
where the attempt on the freight was
made, the {j train : crew found another
lot of ties on the track,. these being so
wedged and \ Jammed into i the switch
frogs ; that the train would have been
ditched if it had , struck them. 'Â¦ .
Guards .were promptly stationed and
one . of I the ; Southern Pacific \ detectives
is I now â¢ on j the '^scene. - Â¦ Deputy * Sheriff
Klernari of this" county late this even
ing arrested two suspicious characters
on the Tuolumne' River near here. The
prisoners slept in a boxcar at Salida
Saturday night. ; They left that place
and started toward Modesto : shortly
before the attempt to wreck the freight
arid were seen two miles to the north of
here an hour" after the Â¦ attempt j on the
passenger. . They refuse to talk or give
their names and can give no.explana
tion of their doings after leaving
Salida. ;
It is conjectured here that the ties
were Vpiled so | as to ditch the north
bound Owl, which -passed at a' high

Hapless Trawlers
British Press Regards
the North Sea Affair
as Plain Act of War
LONDON, Oct. 23.â The attack by the Baltic
fleet upon the hull fishing boats occurred 200 miles
off Spurn v Head. '- The Russian ships were steam
ing in line. Thel leading ships of the fishing fleet
passed without incident, ! though : most of the Rus
sian .vessels turned searchlights on the trawlers
long- enough to" prevent any mistake as to identity.
After, the bulk of the squadron had passed it
opened fire, nearly all participating in the firing.
The. Crane was struck below the water line and
raked above deck.: Skipper Smith and Third Hand
Loggott were decapitated by a shot, many of the
crew being seriously wounded. â¢ Another trawler
also was' sunk, .but the Moulmein, which" brought
the'newsHto Hull,: has no particulars as to her^fatej
news iliasV created an intense sensation and
thegreatest indignation in Hull.
'^ The "Moulmein arrived , with her flag at half
mast.^^ Her. : skipper^ states that the trawlers were
'fishing aljout : 226; miles east of north of Spurn

fishermen were horrified to find they were being

LONDON, Oct. 4.â Foreign Minister Lansdowne and M.
Benckendorff, the Russian -Embassador, both were out of
town yesterday and all the government offices In London
were* closed, as, usual on Sunday; therefore no official view
could : be gleaned of the firing by Russian, war vessels
upon . a British fishing fleet in the North Sea.
. The first reports of the affair received in London were
regarded" as -almost incredible. When, however, cumula
tive evidence no longer left doubt of the general accuracy
of the reports, astonishment became bewilderment as to
what possible motive could have led Russian officers into
such an extraordinary and Inexplicable course of -action.
â¢which, unless a satisfactory explanation be immediately
forthcomingr, is only to be regarded v as an act of war.
This is the view taken editorially by all the morning pa
pers. The worst feature of the story, as viewed here, is
the heartlessness displayed by the Russian fleet in steam
ing away 'without taking the trouble to ascertain even
whether Its fire had inflicted any damage and without any
effort to rescue the victims.
'While. admitting the necessity of a suspension of
judgment for. investigation . and explanation, the morning
newspapers 'are unanimous in demanding that the gov
ernment Instruct Embassador > Hardinge to make the
strongest representations to the St. Petersburg Govern
ment and obtain reparation and apology and assurances
of the Russian Pacific fleet's good behavior for the fu
ture. It -is' held ithat : the omission of the Russian fleet to
stay Its course down the channel to , offer an explanation
makes the case look exceedingly grave, and the only pos
sible solution of the mystery is that, excited by rumor*
recently spread of Japan's Intentions of the Pacific squad
ron, in the event of its sailing, the Russian gunners yielded
to panic and supposed that the trawlers' rockets were the
signals of an enemy's fleet. In view of the decision in the
Allanton case it is regarded, as quite impossible that the
fit;. Petersburg authorities can be in any way responsible
for ;the incident. -. -
' 'Considering the circumstances in the '.case, the news r
papers treat 'the matter with commendable calmness, but
are firm in. demands -for. Immediate satisfaction. The
Chronicle says: Â¦
; . "The next "twenty-four hours must settle it one way or
the other. Only two modes of settlement are possible.
Either -explanation," apology end generous compensation to
the victims' families' or an ultimatum."
The Standard says:
, ;"An*explanation should be promptly and sternly de-,
rnarided'for the intolerable outrage. The Russian .Govern
ment should" be informed that* it Is expected to recall its
illstarred squadron; first, in order that proper Investigation

Kogo.ro Takahira, the Japanese Min
ister in Washington, in a conversation
at the Legation. said:
"When a person of dignity travels In
a foreign country it is almost always
the case that the occasion is used to
start some speculation in regard to the
object of his Journey. So I do not ex
pect that exception should be made of
the visit of his Imperial Highness. But
to attribute it to the so-called .change
In American feeling, as represented by
some newspapers, is entirely a 'guess,*
from wild imagination. The Prince's
visit to this/country was originally
brought into consideration as long ago
as last spring, but as it was a part of
his object to see the world's fair, at
St. Louis, it was considered advisable
to defer it to the autumn, when the
exhibits would be in a*more complete
form for observation, and -for that
reason this time was chosen for his
visit; but there is, of course, no ques
tion about the principal object of his
visit being to strengthen thereby the
ties of genuine friendship so . happily
existing between the United States and
Japan in a most appropriate manner,
bat not in such 'patchwork', fashion as
has been reported; In some quarters.
"His Highness will maintain his of
ficial status as Imperial Prince ; only
in Washington and. St. ; Louis, but lin
all other cities he will travel Incognito.
This is another evidence that he Is
not coming here to start a 'boom,' as
haa been reported. After his: visit to
the fair, where he, will -be particularly
interested to see that '.wonderful dis
play of American genius .and*, energy!
he will visit the educational,' commer
cial and industrial centers . of this
country, such as Boston, Philadelphia;
New York, Pittsburgh and Chicago, ; to
study the true causes' of the 'greatness
of the . United _; States and also the ' le
gitimate Interests of. this great repub
lic in the Far East. ' . -. Â¦ Â¦-, ,;Â¦ Â¦Â¦.

authoritatively to-day that the purpose
of the Emperor of Japan In sending on
a visit to this country his adopted

Fushimi, who will reach San' Francisco
about the middle of November, is to
strengthen by every appropriate means
the traditional friendship between the

palsn i has well prosressed.
In every State and In all sections Democrats
have buried their differences and are working
harmoniously and enthusiastically for the
ticket. Our canvass shows that scarcely any
where is there a trace of the dissensions which
for the past eight years have unhappily di
vided the party. In the States of New York,
New Jersey. Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland,
Delaware and West Virginia and many of the
Western States our organization Is now more
complete and effective than ever before In the
history of the party. Candidates for Gov
ernor who stand for the very highest type Â¦ of
citizenship and represent popular local Â¦ Demo
cratic issues in all the doubtful States, are
greatly aiding: the national ticket by their en
ergetic campaign.
Our canvass shows that we ohall certainly
carry by good the States of New
York, New Jersey. Connecticut. - Maryland.
Delaware. "West Virginia and Indiana and
that, in addition to these .electoral votes, we
shall have the majority. If not all, of the
electoral votes of the Rocky Mountain States.
It Is Impossible at this Juncture to predict
the outeome in Wisconsin. Illinois must also
be classed in' the . doubtful column, for al
though at tbla moment our canvass Is Imper
fect, it ts s\if fleiently advanced to indicate an
unmistakable Republican defection.

', The reply of Governor Wright was
received here from Manila at 1 p. â¢ m.
to-day and is as follows:
MANILA, Oct. 23, 1004.â Secretary of War,
Washington, D. C.i With reference to your
telegram of the 20th, quoting recent^ utter
ances of. Judge Parker Â¦ upon administration
and conditions here and requesting statement
of facts 'relating thereto, - 1 report as follows:
First â The statement that any considerable
number of officials hava proven corrupt. In
efficient or despotic does great injustice to a
body of hard-working, â¢elf-respecting Ameri
cans, whose character^ and service will com
pare favorably , with thpse of employes of the
Federal or State governments. While there
have been a number of defaults by subordi
nates, they are, few as compared- with the
whole,, and have been promptly - detected and
punished.' ' The total of defaults since July,
1901, s beginning civil ; government. : $78,550;
there has been no ultimate loss; the Govern
ment is protected by insurance. We have a
comprehensive civil service law, rigidly en
forced, under, which the antecedents and quali
fications of employes are scrutinized. Default
ers, 'with few exceptions, were appoint*-* dur
ing disturbed conditions, prior to the Inaugu
ration of the ' law. . Complaints . or oppressive
acts are . exceptional and are promptly inves
tigated and ! corrected. The relations between
the American officials and Filipinos as a rule
are cordial.
Second â There is- nothing warranting' the
statement that towns . are in ruin, lands are
going out of cultivation, . people ill fed, unable
to get work, and country ruined agricultur
ally. Towns are in the same, state as before
-the insurrection, save a few burned by the
Insurgents, which have ,- been rebuilt and reoc
,cupled. The towns generally, are populated
aa before. Â¦ Sanitary conditions Â¦ generally are
Improved ; : labor demand generally equals and
In . some cases . exceeds the supply, and at - in
creased wages. - .
In 1901 and 1902 epidemics of surra and
rinderpest destroyed property and 70 per cent
of the animals used In agriculture, , causing â¢ a
reduced area of cultivation and considerable
distress, which the commission relieved by in
augurating public works through aid Â¦ gener
ously extended by Congress.' We have suc
ceeded, by inoculation, i in checking rinderpest.
Those localities most Â¦ seriously affected have
drawn from those where the disease i did not
prevail and this, together with the animals
imported j and the natural Increase, has caused
a steady Increase, so that at present there is
under Â¦ cultivation nearly all the -lands hereto
fore cultivated. jMHifm 1 l '" l llli|MMMI) l *WllÂ«'
â¢ During the fiscal year ending June 30.' 1904.
exports were $30,220,127. imports $33,221,250.
Exports fell off as compared with the previous
year because of the decrease In the copra and
sugar drops, due to a phenomenally small rain
fall ' In j certain sections and to - plague locusts
in others. Of the exportations. $21,794,960 was
hemp; of the importations, $11,648,814 was rice.
. the principal tood of the people. . . The present
crops in all lines are. . exceptionally good and
prices remunerative, and there- is not now and
will not befor the coming; year any suffering
from lack of food. Â» The enrollment In the pub
lic schools In 1903 was 184,202 and In 1904 263,
55C. . â¢
Â¦ Thirdâ Taxation Â¦ Is not : oppressive. Customs
duties average about 18 per cent ad valorem,
as compared - with 25 . per ; cent under â¢ Spanish
rule.' -' Industrial ' taxes - are also less than the
Spanish. Receipts are honestly applied for the
benefit of the people.
- Fourthâ It 'is ; not true 5 that ' there are ; whole
districts ; In Â¦ the - hands of ladrones. There haa
. been an occasional - Instance during - the last
year of depredations of ladrones, who find con
cealment In tha ' remote Â¦ mountain ! fastnesses
and Â£ raid : isolated settlement, and steal the carl
boos. They have been relentlessly pursued by
the constabulary and scouts, who are natives,
usually commanded by American officers. â¢ As
a â¢, result of this policy \ ladronlam is no longer
popular f or i profitable. -I There is at ' this tlma
not a single band . of ladrones operating in the
great Island of Luzon and In I the Vlsayan Inl
ands. There are only four or five lad rone lead
ers" - with a fÂ«w 'Â¦ followers. ; . .â¢ â¢-..*.-;
Â¦ -. There : Is Â¦ no Â¦ disorder t or disposition to vio
lence among the great mass of the people, who
are attending to their usual vocations. Ameri
cans â¢ can â¢â¢ and do go everywhere without dan -
Cer or ' thought : of - it. -v In âÂ¦ 1903 - . there - were
about -, 18,000 , American < troops . in * the islands.
Â¦ This year, there are only about 12,000. It may
be stated generally, that life and Â¦ property are
as safe here as In the United States. .
Â¦ Those . general statements '; as ' to Â¦ peace and
order are Intended to apply to all of the Islands
inhabited by civilized Filipinos ; except the . Isl
and of Samar. It has a population In' the
mountains ", of ' the - interior, Â¦ many of ' whom
have never - seen < a â¢Â¦ white â¢ man, â¢: are semi - sav

by ~ roads t- and c schools are - establ Ished *- occa
sional disturbances â¢ of the Â¦ character indicated
may* be: expected. - ; '-, . . â¢ ;
>>Â»' Fifthâ The ' statement that .' newspapers : are

JS aÂ»Â»^only j possible excuse for â¢ such - a state-
lie also said: '
"The situation in the Philippines to-day is
so terrible, that it passes the comprehension
of - our people at i home. Agriculturally , the
country ; iÂ« lor the x time ruined. :Uand is go
ing out ' of cultivation, ' the population is ill
fed : and - in : some places unable to get work.
The ' country ; Is overburdened with taxation;
disease is prevalent, the farm animals dead;
the towns In many places in ruins; whole dis
tricts in the hands of ladrones; the price- of
products poor and unremuneratlve. Public
opinion Â¦ has no free expression;- newspapers
are bought up, or are browbeaten into silence;
men of Influence, who criticise the commission,
are ostracized; the plays produced in the thea
ters are censored; there is not an organ of ex
pression of the popular voice that la not con
trolled. In* private life the men are subject
to a complete, far-reaching, thorough (system
of , espionage. Detectives appear in the guise
of servants and the oath of a single one is
enough to destroy a man's reputation, property
or even life itself."
Your comment as civil Governor upon this
statement of conditions in the islands is re
quested. â¢ TAFT.
To Wright, Manila: The Democratic candi
date for President on " the 15th of the present
month, in a public 'address, said: â¢
. "But two classes of our people can hope to
be, benefited by our; holding the Philippinesâ
the j class which is always hunting for special
Government privilege* " and the class which
seeks to make j of office-holding a means of
livelihood. The ' latter class in the Philippines
comprises some officials, ; of whom a student
of the islands recently said, 'Of the character
of - many < in oftice, too little cannot bÂ« aakl.
At the best, they . have . been inefficient; at the
wont, dishonest, corrupt and despotic. The
Islands seem, to have succeeded In getting the
very dregs of our people.' "
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 23.â The fol
lowing â¢ cablegrams from Secretary of
War Taft to Governor Wright of the
Philippines and from; the Governor to
the . Secretary in reply thereto were
made public at the War Department
to-day:
, October 20. 180*.
ment Is that something ovÂ«r a year a*o a
crack-brained playwright produced a play In
Tagalog full of insurrectionary utterance* and
culminating in tearing down and stamping
upon the American flag- upon the stage, for
which he and some of his fellow actors were
prosecuted and convicted. It is equally un
true that men In private life are subjected to
espionage or that detectives In the guise of
servants are employed. All these statements
are the variest nonsense without a scintilla of
fact- to support them. The only, use to which
detectives are put is to ferret out criminals, as
is done In the United States, and the number
of detectives employed by thÂ« Government,
upon comparison, will be found to . be fewer
here in proportion to population than in New
York. Judge Parker has evidently been gross
ly deceived.

LINCOLN, Neb., Oct. 23.â Fumes
from an instantaneous heater in the
bathroom of his residence caused . the
death last night of Louis Foltz, a
young business man. His bride of
three months, who was in the bedroom
adjoining, was also overcome and is' in
a precarious condition. Only three
days ago had they returned rom their
wedding tour and commenced house
keeping In their new cottage.
While Foltz was taking his bath, his
wife sat in a chair reading and drop
ped off to sleep. When she awoke she
found her husband's lifeless body lying
at her feet. She screamed and Im
mediately lapsed again into uncon
sciousness..
The, husband had apparently been
overcome in the bathroom and had
succeeded in escaping to the adjoining
room, losing consciousness as be reach
ed his wife's side. The gas had also
penetrated the room where his wife sat
and attacked her while she slept. .

MUKDEN, Oct 23. â The Russian

22.
The Japanese have evacuated Shak

this as the beginning of a general re

Scouts confirm the news brought into
the Russian lines by Chinese of a Jap

It is entirely too soon to credit ru

Japanese have abandoned Yentai and
retired to Liaoyang. On the contrary,
they apparently are preparing for a
stubborn resistance.
The Japanese on October 19 under

their advance guard and silenced their
battery with a loss of four killed and
eight wounded.
The Japanese occupied the village of
Shakhe the night of October 20 and

surprise of an attack in the darkness.
The Riazan regiment then came up and

Captain Parker confirms the details
of the fate of the trawler Crane and
her crew and speaks with intense in
dignation of the conduct of the Rus
sians. He says:
It is impossible that we could have been
taken for anything but trawlers. I can only
imagine that the Russians lost their heads
and blazed away In confusion, and, when they
discovered their mistake, steamed off.
Judging by the rapidity of the shots, they
were rapid-fire guns. I have seen some of the
shots embedded In the boats. They are about
the diameter but not the length of a big cu
cumber and with brass heads.
What with the darkness, the rain and the
glare of searchlights, we were unable to iden
tify the warships. After about a half-hour
the firing suddenly ceased and the fleet steamed
away i nthe direction of the English Channel;
firmed the details of the story received
from Hull, j He says:
On Friday night there were about forty ves
sels of the Gamecock fleet fishing In latitude
C5 degrees < 16 minutes and longitude 6 de
grees G minutes. It was a misty, drizzling
night. We spread over an area of 'some miles.
Our admiral had Just previously signaled by
rockets and colored lights the nshlng directions
for the night. Whether that had anything to
do with what followed I do not know. Tho
whole thing Is a mystery.
Presently, through the mist there appeared
the lights of many vessels, big and small.
Knowing that the Baltic fleet was en route, we
natuarlly assumed that they were Russians,
but I cannot say for certain. ThÂ«y were sig
naling one another, and with powerful search
lights spied out every one of our fleet. Sud
denly some of the warships started firing at
about twenty boats which were nearest to
them. We at first supposed they were blarfc
shots and the boatswain of the Tomtit, which
was close in, held two big flsh out at arm's
length. Some ' say he was offering them to
the Russians In fun and others that he meant
to acquaint the Russians with the fact that wa
were peaceful fishermen and not disguised ene
mies. In any case, there, was no mistaking
our occupation, for we were close enough for
the Russians to see that our men were all
engaged In cleaning flsh. When we realized
that the Russians were firing shot, all became
terror and confusion. - Nets were cut away,
steam was got up and tho trawlers hurried
away â¢ as fast as possible.
HULL, Oct 23. â From Interviews
with the members of trawler crews it
appears that the admiral of the fish
ing: fleet burned green flares to show
that they were harmless fishermen, but
these signals were ignored. Eighteen
wounded men are here for treatment
There is a rumor that the "Great
Northern fishing fleet" also was chased
by the Russians. This report has not

MUKDEN, Oct. 23.â While no pitched
battle has occurred the last few days,
the two armies are kept in touch with
one another, holding the positions they
occupied when the - big battle ended.
There is no evidence that the Russian
army will rush northward, as was the
case after the battle of Liaoyang. In
fact, the Russians have another line
of defenses to fall back upon in the
event that they are forced out of their
present positions. During the last few
days there has been frequent artillery
fire, occasional Infantry attacks and

scouts.

Turning to Morley, he asked:
"Don't you agree with me, Mr. Mor

people?"
"Yes." was thÂ« reply.
Morley last visited this country

"England is of course interested in

I, as every Liberal, have a great ad

All over England and the provinces
there is a growing good feeling toward
America. Every Briton admires
America and her institutions."
Morley will remain in America until
at least the last of November.

lying near by, was also struck by many shots, but
fortunately, the d amage was above her water line
and none of the crew was hit.
. The bombard ment lasted about twenty minutes.
When it had ceased the fleet sailed southward and
some of the trawlers sent up rockets. The Motil
mein steered in the direction of the rockets. Soon
cries were heard, and. the Crane was found sink

her crew. Those seriously wounded were removed
to a Mission ship and the bodies of Smith and
Loggott were placed aboard the Moulmein. The
other men with minor injuries were put aboard the
trawler Seagull.
Crowds gathered around the dock here, but no

Demise of William Johns.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 23. â William
Johns, a retired mining man. passed
away this morning at his home, 2021
Santa Clara avenue, of congestion of
the lungs. He was a native of Eng
land, aged 80 years, and is survived by
a wife, Margaret, and four 'children.
William F.. S. % J., A. T. and C. R.
Johns. His funeral will be hold Tues
day at half-past 12 from his late resi
dence. Interment will be in Mountain
View Cemetery.
It had been planned to take the
Vice President and his friends through
Chinatown in the evening, but Senor
Corral felt a bit indisposed and the
trip was abandoned, with the under
standing, however, that it would be
made fater in the week. Arrangements
have been made for a trip around the
bay to-day on one of the Government
tugs, from which the party will have
an opportunity to view the fortifica
tions, and, if they so desire, they will
be landed at the Islands or at Fort
Baker. On Tuesday Senor Corral and
other male members of his party will
be entertained by the Family Club and
after that the time of the visitors will
be .taken up with private functions.
In discussing the visit of Vice Presi
dent Corral *to San Francisco General
Torres said, yesterday that it had been
one of the' most enjoyable incidents or
his trip. "Nowhere," said ihi gen
eral, "has Senor Corral been made to
more keenly appreciate the hospitality
of the American people. The reoep
tion accorded him the other evening
at the banquet at the Palace Hotel has
left a deep impression on his mind and
has reassured him that' Mexico has its
best friend in the United States."
Vice President Ramon Corral of
Mexico and the members of his dis
tinguished party spent the greater
part of yesterday seeing the sights of
San Francisco. Few of them were new
to Senor Corral, for he has visited the
city before and Is well acquainted with
its many attractions. T,he others of
his party, however, found much to In
terest them. Leaving the St. Francis
Hotel in automobiles, the visitors were
taken through several portions of the
residential part of the city and then
proceeded lelsurefy through Golden
Gate Park, where they were enrap
tured with the scene that nature af
forded them, and enjoyed the ride out
to the ocean beach, where they were
taken along the boulevard and enter
tained for a time at the Cliff House.

Hawks & Mehrtens of the West End
report that all the desirable residences
in their section of the city are occupied
and that aa soon as a new house is
completed there is a long list of pros
pective tenants awaiting. This firm
negotiated the sale* of property at the
West End during the week on which
eight homes are to.be erected. Work
has already commenced on several of
the buildings. Five of the houses are
to be built on Haight avenue, between
Sixth and Seventh streets, one on
Haight avenue and Linden street ana
two on Sixth street, near Santa Clara
avenue. Hawks & Mehrtens also dis
posed of a five-room cottage on Haight
avenue between Sixth and Unden
streets.
Frank N. Dodd of the Alameda Land
Company is authority for the state
ment that his firm is negotiating a
transfer of improved local property in
which $15,000 is Involved, and which the
company- expects to put through be
fore the first of November. This firm
is completing a five-room cottage on
Buena Vista avenue and Lafayette
street and an Eastlake residence on
Clinton avenue and Oak street, both of
which will be' offered for sale. Mr.
Dodd says that among the inquirers for
local property of late there have been
a number of United States army of
ficers. There is already quite a colony
of martial men here and the number
is steadily increasing.
Charles C. Adams & Co. of Bay Sta
tion report that renting with them has
been spirited. During the week the
firm sold a cottage on Bay street,
near Pacific avenue,/ to Frederick
Hughes. Among the prospective buy
ers who visited thjs firm with a re
quest to be shown local property were
a number of persons from the Ha
waiian Islands.
J. C. Hanley has been busy with
renters and expects to be busier after
election day.
Juster& Balrd, of Berkeley, report a
large number of sales, among the most
important of which is the recent pur
chase by Professor Gayley of the State
University of a lot, 100x150 feet, on the
corner of Piedmont and Durant
avenues. Professor Gayley will soon
begin the erection of an elegant resi
dence on the property. Two adjoining
lots on Piedmont avenue were pur
chased a, few days later by General
Greenleaf, - who will also erect a fine
residence. .
Another improvement club has been
organized in Piedmont, and at the last
meeting the following officers were
elected:

Oakland Office San Francisco Call
1016 Broadway, Oct. 23.
With the approach of winter there
has been a large increase in the de
mand for inside business property in
Oakland, by non-resident merchants
and manufacturers, one real estate
firm alone having had inquiries from
six men from other cities. Two of
these prospective purchasers have al
ready visited Oakland and have de
cided upon the district in which they
desire to locate. One man wishes to
buy business property anywhere be
tween Fourteenth and Eighteenth
streets, and Broadway and San Pablo
avenue, at a price not to exceed $15,
000, and the other is willing to pay
any part of $50,000 for a good business
location In a central place, north of
Twelfth street.
This increasing demand for centrally
located business property north of
'Fourteenth street indicates that the
growth of the business district of the
city is extending north and west, along
Broadway, Telegraph avenue and San
Pablo avenue, and this growth has
already affected the prices of stores
for rent along these . thoroughfares.
Harry L. Holcomb, who has the rent
ing of a large number of stores on San
Pablo avenue, says that during the
last year rents between Fourteenth and
Twentieth streets have advanced fully
25 per cent.-^
This advance in rents has not affect
ed the demand for stores along the
avenue to any extent, and although
several new buildings have been erect
ed in the last twelve months, largely
increasing the number of available lo
cations, there is hardly a vacant 3tore
to be had at any price. Some of the
new stores were leased before the
buildings in which they are located
were completed.
There has also been an advance In
the rent of residence properftr in all
parts of the city. Dealers agree that
in the last twelve months prices of
houses for rent have increased about
10 per cent over the preceding year's
rates. Agents report that their only
trouble is to secure enough cottages
and flats to supply the demand of rent
ers, at least half of whom are non-res
idents of Oakland, peoyle who wish to
rent until they can purchase desirable
home property.
Real estate men throughout the city
report a better market now than at
any time during the present year, and
they express confidence that all kinds
of property will find ready sale during
the coming winter. George W. Austin
said:
I have had more, demands for property of all
kinds in the last three weeks than during; the
same period since the flrst of the year. Within
two weeks I have had half a. dozen Inquiries
for business locations in the center of the city,
all of which have come from reputable non
resident business men. I have Just received

ROME, Oct 23. â Pope Piux X
waited almost the whole of last night
for telegrams from Monslgneur Mon
tagnini, auditor of the Papal Nuncia
ture at Paris, about the decision In
the French Chamber of Deputies. His
Holiness was not surprised* at the
statement and speech of Premier
Combes, but he had not thought from
private information he had received,
that the . Premier's majority in the
Chamber would be so large as It was.
The Pope and his entourage at
tribute the new success of Premier
Combes to the influence of the Free
masons, who, according to reports re
celved-at the Vatican, are determined
to bring about the separation of
church and state in order to be freer
to undertake a campaign with the
object of destroying all religious feel
ing in France.
When the .news was received the
Pontiff exclaimed: "God's will -be
done."
Gamblers and other tough charac
ters ordered from Dawson are con
gregating at Fairbanks. The majority
of the crooks are now hanging around
dance halls and gambling resorts, but
it is expected that biting weather and
dullness of winter will drive them to
crimes. Yukon pioneers predict that
crimes will be numerous . this winter
throughout the Tanana district
So much liquor was shipped in dur
ing the summer that there is said to
be a barrel of beer or a case of whisky
for every inhabitant. Steamers from
Dawson left machinery and even food
supplies behind in order to carry
liquors. The district finds itself very
short of sleds for transporting ma
chinery to the various creeks because
in the rush of people durthg the sum
mer no heed was given to the need of
sleds for winter use.
TACOMA, Oct. 23.â Arrivals at
Dawson from Fairbanks say that the
town Is infested with the worst crooks
and camblers from Yukon towns to
such an extent that the Government
is planning unusual precautions
against their work during the long
winter. It la expected that, a detach
ment of soldiers from Fort Gibbons
will -winter at Fairbanks.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 23. â The State
Board of Prison Directors, at their
meeting at the Folsom Prison last
night, adopted a prison regulation
warranting the use of the straitjacket
for the punishment of refractory, pris
oners in extreme cases where other
punishment is deemed insufficient. The
resolution adopted was as follows:
Resolved, That wardens of State prisons are
authorized to Inflict on refractory convicts
euch usual punishments aa are practiced In
X'riscns in the United States, using no more
severity than la necessary.
The strait Jacket shall be used only in ex
treme cases where ' ' other punishment is
deemed insufficient and not'- continuously for
more than air hours at a time.
No corporeal punishment is allowed to be
inflicted without the prisoner is first exam
ined by the prison physician and found able to
undergo the punishment proposed. The physi
cian may order a cessation of the punishment
If he thinks It is too severe. He shall visit
the prisoner as often during: the punishment as
may be necessary, and also at its termination.
The warden shall report all punishments and
the reasons therefor at the meeting of the
board next following the punishment.
The question of constructing cells
for the accommodation' of the con
victs was discussed, but definite ac
tion was deferred. â¢
Four recommendations for parole
were made, two of the convicts being
from Sacramento and two, Jules Si
monson, twelve years,' for burglary,
and W. F. Bochle. for life, murder,
from San Francisco.

has been learned that the directors of

tel In New York with regard - to his
coming to the St. Francis, in the event
of which Dohrmann will resume his

ed two of their fellow members in
the board, Mahoney and j Gentle, to

internal affairs of the hotels a task
which they have already, undertaken.
It was reported yesterday that the
management is seriously contemplat
ing several changes among the higher
officials of the St. Francis, with a
view of economy, and the story, while
emphatically denied by the directors,
has caused considerable uneasiness
among the employes.

MONDAY .".... .OCTOBER 24,' 1904
The Business Men's Parker and Davis dissociation of New York has arranged to hold a
mass-meeting in Carnegie Hall on October 12. -Ex-President Cleveland has consented to preside.
The principal speech will be by John G. Carlisle t 'ex-S ear etary of the 'Treasury -~Dz\Xy Papers.
CHAIRMAN ' TAGGART. "Step inside ana 'hear reminiscences of 1893."
THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE-SHOW
THE latest contribution on the
much discussed institution/the
home, is from the pen of Marga
ret Sangster. Her new book on
"The Little Kingdom of . Home" ad
vances no . revolutionary theories
regarding the domestic relations,
but says a good many things that are
worth remembering, as It follows the
bride and bridegroom from the altar
through their trials with their rela
tives-in-Iaw, the selection and fur
nishing of their home, their adjust
ment of their characters to each other,
the coming of children, etc, says the
New York Tribune. It steers a middle
course on the race suicide and do
mestic service problems, advocates a
uniform divorce law, and, while point
ing, out serious dangers that threaten
the time honored institution under dis
cussion, detects elements of hope in
the situation.
One chapter, entitled "Bricks With
out Straw," deals with the financial
policy of the home and the. wife's right
to a share of the Income.
"Despotism never -had a more ex
treme illustration nor was cruelty ever
more refined," says Mrs. Sangster,
"than when the ancient Egyptians in
sisted that their workmen should do
unpaid piecework, but refused to sup
ply them with materials for the Job.
Yet in thousands and tens of thou
sands of modern homes a similar in
justice is perpetrated, not on slaves,
but on loved ones, and It is new every
morning and fresh every evening.
Adoring husbands do not hesitate to
inflict upon their beloved wives a need
less humiliation, amounting in the ex
perience of supersensltive women to
suffering which is almost torture. The
woman does not live who enjoys ask
ing her husband for money and render
ing to him an account of the way in
which she spends what he gives her,
whether he pours it generously into her
lap or .doles it grudgingly from his
pocket, openly wondering why her
purse is so often empty, and openly
discussing her economy\ or her lack
of the same.. Men seldom suspect how
deeply ingrained in wonin'a souls ia
the aversion to being slaply licensed
mendicants. If they did they would.
in the language of Scripture, abhor
themselves and repent, if *aot In dust
and ashes, at least in sucl wise that
an entire change of conditions wouU
speedily ensue. A good man means to
be just if not magnanimous There is
no. reason why, in the family firm, the
husband should claim and maintain the
sole right to disburse the family la
come, while the wife I3 a tolerated pen
sioner on his bounty.
"Only those who have studied the
subject and observed its application ia
many homes, from that of the million
aire to that of the poorest laborer,
know how necessary is a rÂ«form In this
one particular," continues Mrs. Sang-
Bter. "Mistaken domestic finance
wrecks home happiness. Women live
In palaces, wear rich raiment and faro
sumptuously, yet seldom have any
ready money or the least liberty to
spend or give away or Invest a dollar
of. their own, being treated all their
lives as if they were irresponsible
children. In the event of the death of
the husband or father, such women are
often at the mercy of unscrupulous ad
visers, whp find them an easy prey
because of their Inexperience.
"It is not an unheard of thing for the
wife of a rich man, permitted to have
running accounts at stores and to ac
cumulate bills which her husband ex
amines and pays, to lack small change
for carfares and tip* to the drivers of
cabs and handsoms. In reality, the
women most favorably situated for
their own ease and contentment are
the wives of mechanics and day labor
ers and factory operators, to whom the
week's wages are regularly brought,
minus the small sum the man keeps for
his own purposes. The custom of this
class is based on a larger justice than
the other custom, which makes the
husband the undisputed lord of the
exchequer. A wife is a partner la
business, not an unpaid hireling."

THE London papers record the wrecking of two new plays in the
breakers of public disapproval. One of them was brought out
under; the management of Mrs. James Brown Potter, who also
assumed the leading role. It was one of the pathological plays, deal
ing with unlawful love, and the actress. sought to redeem its inanities
by emotional dressing. It was howled off the stage* at -the Savoy,
and Mrs. Potter, prostrated by disappointments, has secluded her
self at' her country seat, Bray Lodge, near Windsor, declaring that
she has forsaken the stage for this season. The tragic element is
supplied by the remarriage of her former husband the same day that
ehe was jeered by her London audience.
The other play, condemned in Lbndon-.on its first representation,
was writtenby Pmero, who gave us that indescribable drama of
grievous immorality, "Iris." His last effort was brought out by
Frohman and is entitled "The Smileless Wife." Among its stage
accessories was an electric doll, the antics of which were expected
to win a smile from the wife, who had entered upon a marriage of
convenience. The play and the doll and 1 all of; its pathblogi cal 'sug
gestions were voted by the audience not only bad but a bore.
These verdicts are; hopeful, signs of returning good taste and
sense in the public respecting the drama. -We have a surfeit of mar-,
ital immorality and the degradation of the domestic relations. 1 -Crime
and sorrow, belated repentance and the, punishment of selfishness
are in the actual world around us, and there re no evidence that their
prevalence is less as the result of any lesson taught by the pernicious
plays of Pinero and his imitators. They have' an\ unwholesome an-
fluence upon, the stage and upon society. Vice and transgression are
in the world, but^there is no : merit nor help in dragging them out
of concealment, to be the theme of dramas that incite to their imita
tion rather than to ; their cure ; The stage is no doubt a -high social
influence, and like other forms of literature the ] drama should make
for the cleanness , of life ; rather than for adding filth as food : for the
lawless imagination. ~ r^v

Extravagance in buttons seems to
have disturbed certain minds of late,
not, as it might appear, in the number
often used as part of the trimmings
of a dress, but in their Increasing cost.
That a set for a blouse of half a dozen
gold buttons mounted with sapphires
should havfe cost 5100 each has struck
the superficial observer- as a proof of
most lamentable recklessness in ex
penditure, and is cited to show how
greatly prosperous the times must be
when money can be thus laid out in
accessories of the kind.
It is perhaps overlooked, however,
says the New York Globe, that a set
of buttons of such value is as much
a permanent addition to the jewel case
as a brooch or a diamond comb.
At the present time a particularly
popular form for the fastening to take
is that of a safety pin brooch, nearly
two inches long, at the throat, and set
with a little cluster of pearls and tur
quoises, a tiny enamel star or shield, or
a like device, while three others similar,
but a size smaller, are employed be
neath at intervals.
The fashion for buttons of sufficient
value to be used again : and again be
gan probably with the sets of j half a
dozen in silver, introduced about 'three
years ago', and very often accompanied
by a waist buckle to match. More and
more art has been expended upon them
meantime, "and the Jeweler-has per
ceived that a set of jeweled buttons
is simply the equivalent to the studs
which mankind has used in its shirt
fronts for a generation. Hence .women
are not developing a wholly reprehen
sible extravagance if, instead . of v one
big Item as a pendant of a brooch, they
select; half a dozen smaller ornaments
under the name of buttons.
BUTTONS AT $100 EACH \
COCKRAN and Schurz are on the warpath against Roosevelt.
They are really alarmed about the constitution, which they
fear is about to be burned up: and the ashes scattered.. Mr.
Cockran is in such alarm that he has made a speech on the'subject,
a careful reading of which discloses the origin of his severe case of
panic. He finds that President Roosevelt has destroyed the consti
tution by his order fixing the pensionable age of veteran soldiers at
62. In his letter of acceptance President Roosevelt discussed that
executive order and declared that it was revocable and asked if Judge
Parker would revoke it if elected. Upon this Mr. Cockran makes a
speech which is being circulated as a Democratic campaign docu
ment. He argues that if the order is revocable that is evidence of its
unconstitutionality.
Now, first as to the order itself. It is an exact copy of the
pension age order issued by President Cleveland. He fixed the age
limit by executive, act alone. He did not consult Congress about it :
he did it as President, and thousands of veterans began drawing
pensions in pursuance of it, and are drawing them yet. It was an
executive order and Mr. Cockran should know that all executive
orders are revocable by the same President who issues them, or by
any of his successors. To illustrate : President Cleveland issued an
executive order for the return of the' battle flags, and he revoked it
upon discovering that it was in excess of his power.. But he issued
his pension age order, within his power, and it stood to the end of
his administration and through McKinley's and until President
Roosevelt revoked it by substituting for it an order lowering the
pension age from 65 years to 62.
If this new order in the same matter violates the constitution
and justifies Mr. Cockran's speech of sixteen pages, what must be
said of the order which it supersedes? If President Roosevelt's or
der violates the constitution so did the same order when issued by
Mr. Cleveland.. If it assassinated the constitution, "why did not Mr.
Cockran come to the rescue when the crime was. committed by Mr.
Cleveland?
Of course he knows that neither Cleveland nor Roosevelt vio
lated the constitution by that order. It was a proper executive act,
entirely within the power of the President, and the criticism of it is
contemptible and hypocritical.
Mr. Schurz is alarmed about the constitution. But he served
for four years as a member of the Cabinet of President Hayes and
never blinked. '
COCKRAN AND SCHURZ.
OPTIMISM still characterizes trade all over the country.
There is no depression of any character anywhere, i In Wall
street stocks, grain and produce markets, manufactures, farm
ing communities and railroad and financial circles the feeling of
buoyancy is general. There is a tendency to inflate and magnify
this bullish reaction in Wall street, but elsewhere throughout the
country there is no serious attempt to develop the current improve
ment in business to the magnitude of a boom. ?'.*!'Â£
The most conclusive sign of the current improvement is found
in the pronounced expansion of the country's bank clearings. Last
week they soared up to $2,750,256,000, which is a remarkable leap
from the $1,800,000,000 point where they stood so long. Not for
many months have these clearings risen so high. - The average fig
ures for the past year or two were $2,000,000,000, and for months
they ran $200,000,000 below the two billion point.
: Of course much of this remarkable gain in the country's clear
ings is due to the great activity on the New York Stock Exchange,
where trading in industrial and railroad stocks has of late become
surprisingly large, the sales last Friday running up to 1,925,300
shares. This is shown by the 55 per cent increase ov.er the same
week last year at New York. But as the gains are common in all
the large cities except Pittsburg, Kansas City, New Orleans and
Cleveland, and are general all over the. country, they show that the
increase in the volume of trade is by no means confined to New
York. The improvement there is only a part of the whole.
Further proof of the expansion is found in the rtrrfe^ 1-7 *- :1 
ures, which were 215 last week, compared with 279 for the corre
sponding week last year. This is the best exhibit made for a year
or two. They are all small failures, too. There have been no large
failures for weeks, nor any bank collapses. Collections are reported
good everywhere, especially in the South, where the indications of a
fine cotton crop, at least 11,000,000 bales, hold out brilliant promises
for the coming year. Money is reported plentiful everywhere.
Still another proof of the increased activity in general trade is
found in the reopening of many idle mills and a steadily growing
output of manufactured goods. The revival in the iron and steel
industry, predictions of which a month or two ago were received
with incredulity, is turning out genuine after all, as large orders for
railroad and structural material are now being placed, and the gen
eral opinion is that the depression in this industry has run its
course. Additional favorable signs are found in an excellent job
bing demand for the leading staples, such as .groceries, footwear,
hardware, clothing and lumber, the expansion in the latter being
chiefly in the West. Still further confirmation is a better demand
for spring goods than observed last year at this time.
The only indication of recession is the sharp falling off in the
demand for wheat and flour throughout the West during the past
three or four days. But as this demand was feverish and apparently
insatiable for several months, a reaction is to be expected, as the
Western millers naturally loaded themselves up with recent phe
nomenal purchases of grain all over the country.
The trade revival is all the more remarkable in that it comes
just on the eve of a Presidential election, when by all the rules of
precedent business ought to be dull. It is this unusual condition
that stamps it as sterling.

Talking Through His Hat.
The members of the Manchester Fire
Brigade are experimenting with a new
helmet meant for use by men who may
be sent -into the interior of a burning
structure, where they could not venture
under ordinary : circumstances." This
headgear is fitted with an electric light
by means of which the surroundings are
illuminated, ; a constant supply of fresh
air is passed through the helmet so that
the fireman will not be strangled by the
impure atmosphere in which he is work
ing, and besides this a telephone is
rigged up inside - the helmet : so that
while; he: is engaged . in > fighting the
flames he may be in constant communi
cation with those outside. and may give
suggestions and Information which it
might be desirable for those outside to
know.
Devices of this character are not un
common, but there is none which seems
to ;be - quite so complete as this â¢ one.
The: manner In , which the telephone is
placed inside the helmet makes It pos
sible for. the fireman to have the use of
his hands at all times and yet to be in
constant touch with '" those outside of
the : burning building. \
DEVILED HAM.â Take the trim
mings of boiled ham*, both fat , and
lean, and grind or chop very 'fine.
Pound to a paste, seasoning high with
cayenne, mustard and salt. If need
ed. Turn into a baking dish and set
in a slow oven for half an hour. Press
the meat into small Jars and cover
with melted butter or dripping which
Is almost cool and will harden over
the top without mixing with the meat.
PRATER CROSSâ A. Q.. CJty. The
large cross in Golden Gate Park was
donated to San Francisco by the late
George W. Childs of Philadelphia, and
It was erected "to commemorate the
first Christian service In the English
tongue on our coast and the first use
of the book of common prayer." It is
"a memorial of the service held on the
shore of Drakes Bay, Marln County,
Cal., about June 24, St. John's day.
1579, by Francis Fletcher, priest of the
Church of England, chaplain of Sir
Francis Drake."
FILLING FOR CAKE. â Melt flva
tablespoons of grated chocolate with
cream enough to make a smooth mass.
Add one cup of sugar and one beaten
egg. Cook until thick and* smooth;
add one teaspoon of vanilla flavoring:
and spread between cakes.
SALT LAKE.FIOHTâ EL K. City. In
the fight between "Spider" Welch and
"Battling" Nelson at Salt Lake City
recently the police Interfered In the sev
enteenth round on account of the seri

that time.
ORANGE FLOAT. â Put one quart
of water over the fire: rub six level
tablespoon! uls of corn starch In a lit
tle cold water; then stir this Into the
boiling water ana cook slowly for ten
minutes, stirring constantly; take from
the fire; add one cup of sugar, juice
and pulp of two lemons; cut five sweet
oranges in small pieces, remove the
seeds and pour the boiling corn starch
over them; stand in a cool place;

It is no longer necessary to be mar
ried even In the softest satin or most
clinging silk; ordinary muslins, silk
muslins, - chiffons, eollennes, and even
voiles with lace let In at intervals are
considered quite appropriate. White
Bilk and kindred stuffs are embroidered
in open hole, work, with orange blos
soms, daisies and sprays of dainty for
get-me-nots, and sometimes these em
broideries are simply charming:. If you
have lovely lace in the family by all
means wear It, otherwise tulle Is much
prettier. Let it be Soft and. volumin
ous, cut square; It is prettier not to
have any hem or applique work round;
take care that it does not rest too flatly
on the head; an orange blossom wreath,
white violets, or lilies of the valley may
hold the pleats in place, or jewels.
Wreaths of orange blossoms have come
back to us from twenty years ago, and
they look admirable with the lace veils.
The ehoes are either worked in silver
or with orange' blossom. A handful of
Annunciation lilies is now the favorite
bridal bouquet It is held - in the left
hand, and the wedding gown is often
embroidered with the same flowers.

Then the Papyrus Club and the Cap
and Bells have no need for apologies.
They are fulfilling a divine minion,
and should have the encouragement
of every promoter of gladness â and
in this gray old world we have more
need of promoters of gladness than of
promoters of goodness, because for
sooth gladness leads to goodness.
To be cure there are those who
say that humor, or its stepbrother wit.
are Qualities of mind and heart, and
are inborn. That Is undoubtedly true.
Likewise is it true that a predilection
for music is inborn, but it needs cul
tivation and entertainment for de
velopment. And thus It Is for humor.
So hush, ye scoffers, who laugh at
women's clubs whose avowed object
is the "saving grace." Ahl the balm
that humor brings into the embarrass
ments of life. As an antidote for di
vorce a woman's humor has tho in
terlocutory decree beaten a mile.
What a variety of activities wom
en's clubs cover 1 â running the gamut
from philanthropy to fun! The latter,
however, is of rather recent develop
ment. Why? Possibly because wom
en's sense of fun and humor la of
rather recent development among the
masses. Don't scowl, friends! 'Tls
the unvarnished truth. To those of
you who possess the divine sense â the
saving graoeâ there is no offense. And
to you who recognize the sex de
ficiency â though through no fault of
ours, but of our upbringings â and who
seek the sunny side of things, here's
to you! May the sun shine the
brighter for you, may the swallows
build under your windows and throw
the fflad note of their loves Into your
eoals! That is joyousness, and Joy
ousness Is the mothe> of humor. Wit
is another creature, possibly a step
brother to humor, with sarcasm or
satire the father. Without wit the
world could thrive â without humor It
would wither, even as would the blos
soms of spring without sunshine.
Then here's to tho club that makes
humor to order â that seeks it, honors
it and by entertaining it, gets on
speaking terms with it.

Fever. H. C. Knott. 112 Fell St., was last
week prostrated with this deadly fever. His '
symptoms were alarming. fever, extreme/;

ited "blood." At height of fever Rexradlo's ;
I first treatment quickly started a profuse ;
I sweat, when all extreme symptoms largely !
{ subsided right away, pulse and temperature >
i became nearly normal. After second treat- j
j ment (same day) further copious sweating, J
! followed speedily by perfectly normal pulse j
j and temperature, and complete cessation of Â¦
blood vomiting. Patient became cool, easy, j
! restfyl, slept long, soundly. Next' morning j
felt weak but well, and went out to transact I
business all day. To date no relapse, and pa- i
tient has quickly recuperated. To-day he (
said: "I am feeling perfectly well. I,owe |
my wonderful recovery, and perhaps my 1

j surprising manner, producing a refreshing j

tounded at my rapid and complete Â¦ cure, and ,
as a small token of my practical gratitude I ,
have Insisted on Rexradio's acceptance of a
block of stock in a guld mine with which I 1
am connected. Language is too poor to ex- I
press my appreciation of his truly marvelous
rower. While he is around I shall never |
again dread 'Typhoid.' I am willing to

"REXRADIO" last week by one brief treat-
ment publicly restored many totally deaf ears, j
some of which were witnessed by one of the
most noted city "physicians" (name at of- â¢

its correctness. Another physician brought a
"deaf mute." who In 3 seconds began to heat
and speak. A third physician, at hall, pub-
.Jicly counseled alleged ."Incurables" by medi-
cine to try Rexradlo's power. When thes4
"physicians" Indorse tbls treatment, "lay-
men" may do well to "investigate" it
" 'REXRADIO'S' one treatment entirely cured
the paralysis with which my baby was
â¢born.' " Mrs. Allen, 379 Bartlett.
"P.EXRADIO" has recently made several
"deaf mutes" hear and speak before numer-
ous witnesses. One case was witnessed by
Mr. Butler of the S. F. Chronicle, who
signed the record, vouching for its "correct-
ness."

whelming defeat -this afternoon by the
William Blackwell aggregation of San

The latter team was the strongest ever

struggle. ,. J. ,.C. * Henry of' the San
Francisco club suffered a fracture of
one of the. bones 6t the. left hand'dur
ing the third period and had to retire
from the game.' The visitors were
prevented Trom â¢ running up a much

Naught to Naught Contest at the Pre
sidio Grounds. Shows Excellent
Mass Play Combinations.
With an ideal day for the sport, and
a fast field, the football teams of La
Union and Company, H, League of the
Cross Cadets, yesterday afternoon at
the Presidio athletic grounds lined up
and for forty-five minutes stubbornly
contested for superiority. At the call
of time on the . second half the ball
was in the center of the field" in the
hands of the wearers, of the black
and orange (La Union) who had a
slight advantage through the 0 "to 0
contest.
The features of the day's play were
the plunges 'through the line of the
Company, H Vacks/ and several clever
punts by' the men behind the line for
La Union. Two field goals were tried,
one apiece for the contestants arid
both were narrowly missed. But one
.accident marred the day, Julius * Erl

unconscious. The line-up of thÂ«s
teams was as follows:

Star. Pointer, l:59i/J. He has won
more than $18,000.
The Cemand for good roadsters and
track horses was never better than It
is Just now in California. Ordinary,
horses that have nothing to- commend
them except that they are "standard"
are slow sale, unless consigned to the
auction rings frequented by express
men and milkmen. These are having
a hard time to ret sufficient horses to
draw their wagons.* They will- pay
from 5100 to $150 for horses that will
answer their purposes. Hundreds of
standard bred horses that cannot trot
or "pace fast enough to do - for - road
purposes are sent to these auctions and
meet ready sale. Horses with enough
speed to compete in races on the cir
cuit are. in good demand at $1000 and
upward, and the supply falls far short
of the demand.
' Before the close of the Cincinnati
meeting,, J... A- . Richardson of Boise
City, Idaho, owner of the pacer Ore
gon. Maid,' filed a. protest with the
Judges against the payment* of . the
winnings of the pacer King Direct,
"which won nrst money in the 1:09
pace." The grounds for. the protest
are that both King Direct and Ben ; P,
who started in the event named, are
owned by the same man, James-But
ler of New York. King Direct : is.in
the string of Mr. Geers and is entered
In the name of E. F. Geers. Ben F ta
entered by East View Farm. New
York, and is In the string of Monroe
Salisbury.
One hundred trotters and pacers are
being trained at the famous Pleasan
ton track. Applications for stalls are
becoming so numerous that many new
ones will have to be built If an that
want to train at the "horse center** axe
to be accommodated. *
The sale of the ex-California trotting
stallion McKinney, 2:11%, last week for
$50,000 is the sensation of the year in
harness horse circles. It was a surprise
to all horsemen, as it has not been
known he was for sale. When H. B.
Gentry of Bloomlngton. Ind., paid
Charles A. Durfee of San Jose $25,000
for the - champion sire two years ago,
he had just established the Gentry
stock farm, and now it is announced
that failing health has compelled him
to retire from all business. William
Simpson, a New York millionaire mer
chant and prominent horse breeder, is'
the new owner. All the brood mares on
the Gentry farm are to be sold at auc
tion. It is â¢ reported Mr. Gentry will
come to California in, search of health.
Â¦ The rich (7000 Futurity offered by the
Pacific Coast Trotting Horse Breeders'
Association, and which closed on' the

The day of rest was a day of toil,
agony and anxiety for Mike Fisher. He
had figured on making a finish yester
day that would take all the fight out
of Peter's Commuters. But it was not
to be, for the best Mike got was a
game, and he may be thankful for that.
Scores: Morning game â Tacoma 4.
Oakland 2; afternoon game â Oakland 2,
Tacoma 1.
As usual in this series, the pitchers
were the men behind the whole layout.
Big Overall was there with speed and
electrified the vast throng. Dr. Moski
xnan was cool and scientific and held
the sluggers from Tacoma town at bay
ell the time. The honors were about
on a par, though Overall seemed to
have Oakland entirely at his mercy.
The score was one all in the eighth
inning, when Strelb smashed the ball
so hard to Sheehan that the latter
could not handle it. Captain Graham's
moment of anxiety was at hand and
he allowed the next ball to go through
him. Streib was Quick to see his ad
vantage and landed at second. Dever
eaux laid down a bunt, advancing the
runner another notch. Byrnes produced
one of those Texas leaguers, the
flukest kind of base hits, yet the surest
and hardest to get. It poised above
the heads of Eagan and McLaughlin
and neither got it. When it had hit
the ground, Streib was already sliding
into the plate and the great battle was
won.
Oakland scored the first run as well
as the last. Schlafley tore off the first
hit from Overall's delivery in the fifthâ
a double to left Kruger bunted him
along the line and Streib made the
hearts of the multitude happy with a
choppy one to right. Byrnes tore loose
one that was going safe till Delmas
reached out and got it with one mitt,
completing the spectacular play of the
day.
The Tigers could not even it up till
the seventh. Then Eagan got one of
those old fatal walks to" first and Lynch
sacrificed. McLaughlin went out and
the Oakland admirers breathed easier.
They forgot to' reckon Delmas In on
the play. He stepped into a fast one
end sent it on a mad career out to cen
ter field, Bcoring the Truck kid. Scores:

CLOSING DAYS OF BRITT'S AND GANS' TRAINING FOR COMING FIGHT
THE SAN ERANGISCO^ GALli;;?MONDAY; OCTOBER 24, 1904.
Kelly fought Gans in 1899. Kelly was
all in at the end of the fight, but he
kept telling Gans he would knock him
out if his friends had not'bet that Gans
would last twenty-five rounds. Kelly
In the morning Britt enjoyed an easy
stroll and ' after returning and' being
rubbed down took luncheon and then
rested until it was time to go into the
gymnasium. Spider Kelly, will take
command at Jimmy's camp to-day and
Britt .will hear more coaching than
he has listened to during the past week.
Kelly has made a study of the Gans
style of winning fights and believes he
can put- ': Britt wise to certain moves
that will redound to the white man's
advantage in the coming contest.
Five hundred visitors made their way
to Jimmy Brltt's training quarters in
Alameda yesterday afternoon td^waleh'
th> little fighter go \ through his gym
nasium stunts. Britt did not disap
point his guests. He boxed four speed/
rounds with Frank Rafael, skipped the
rope times without number "and went
through several rounds of shadow spar
ring before the: large crowd thai
thronged his quarters- Many of, the
witnesses of Jimmy's prowess and agil
ity were ladies and more than one pair
of gloves were damaged by fair ones
in clapping when Britt scored against
his boxing mate. ".

The fighters enter upon the last week
of their training to-day. From appear
ances the men will have to do only

on their condition. â¢. r ,.
A large delegation of sporting men
visited. Billy Shannon's villa yesterday
to watch Joe Gans work for his coming
battle. Many colored men were among
those present^ "Â¦si'*
The gymnasium where Joe Is pre
paring for the championship' fight - Is
rather" small and Al Herford had- to
exclude everybody but the newspaper
men and a few. friends while Joe went
through his usual stunts. When the
time came for him to box the doors
were thrown open and everybody was
admitted. Joe went four fast rounds
with Jlmmie Hay ward, a colored boxer
from the East. . The champion's con
dition greatly pleased his admirers.
: In" the morning Joe did ; his usual
fourteen miles on the road and returned
as fresh as a daisy. An. hour's hard
/work in 'the gymnasium in the after
noon constituted his day's work.
Gans is in excellent condition and
his weight still hovers between 134
and 135 pounds.
The sale of seats will open to-morrow
at Harry Corbett's- From appearances
the house will be the largest ever at

The visitors were met at the wharf
by the members of the new local coun
cil and two bands. After a parade
through the principal streets of the
town the Imposing procession marched
to St. Vincent's Church, where a high
mass was celebrated. The walls of
the sacred ediflce were decorated with
palms. The upright chandeliers were
twined with sxnilax and each was
adorned with a bow of red, white and
blue ribbons. The mass was sung by
Father Doogan. Father Netterville
was deacon and Father dlyne subdea
con. Father Driscoll delivered an elo
quent and impressive ' sermon. He
spoke of the benefits of organization
and exhorted his hearers never to
swerve from the path of rectitude, but
as the knights of old, be true knights
of modern society. Be a friend, he
said, to all mankind, irrespective of
creed or nationality, and show the
world that the era of knighthood has
not passed, Â° but has only reached its
golden age.
The music was one of the features
of a very Interesting occasion, and was
rendered by the choir of San Francisco
Council, led by Rev. J. B. Hannigan,
while Professor Artlgues of California
Council was organist- Gounod's "Messe
Breve" was given with beauty and 1m
pressiveness, and Joseph J. Rosborough
sang "O Salutaris" as an offertory with
fine effect."
After mass .the visitors were served
with lunch at Eagles' Hall by the Cath
olic ladies of Vallejo. . A little later the
lfflcers elect of the new local' council
were installed in San Pablo Hall and
the organization instituted. :

Bernard Hoffmann, night dark at thÂ©
Alnslee apartment-house, 620 Turk
street, committed suicide early yester
day morning by drinking the contents
of a bottle, or bottles, of carbolic 'add.
Three empty 'bottles were found In his
room.' He telephoned to Mrs. Tread way
and Mrsi i Risman, who ' have apart
ments in the house, that he intended to
commit suicide.;. They thought he was
joking. Later .1 he' went, to their apart-'
ments, rang; the .bell, and when the
door was opened '> he fell unconscious
in the hallway. V. * y
The manager of the house called an
ambulance from the Central Emergency
Hospital, but before the hospital was
reached Hoffman had breathed his last.
Hoffmann was 26 years of age and his
parents live in Oil City, Pa. A dispatch
was sent to them, asking what disposi
tion they wanted made of the body. Â»
Friends of Hoffmann say that. he had
been drinking heavily. He ,told Mrs.
Risman early in the evening that he
had lost his position and he had only a
quarter left, which would buy his sup
per. . .
He had been, it is said, paying his
addresses tp -Miss ' Morton. Â¦ 1637 Devisa
dero street. .She "called at \the Morgue
and wept bitterly -when she gazed upon
the dead body. She denied that there
was anything more than friendship be
tween them. She last saw him 'on Fri
day night, ' and from his manner she
never , thought he would commit sui
cide. . She . believes he must have been
crazy from drinking. He had been
promised a * good position in a few
days.
"While the road is being built a big
dock is under process of construction
at Corinto, which is one of the finest
land locked harbors on the Pacific
Coast. "When these improvements are
finished Nicaragua will cut an impor
tant figure in the trade of Central
America. The railroad will afford a
means of transporting a greater
amount of the banana product of the
republic to' the American markets and
will open up a valuable portion of the
country. The route is very level and
this will greatly facilitate the build
ing of the line. ! .
"Although the construction of the
Panama canal is giving the people of
Nicaragua little concern so far as pos
sible commercial competition is in
volved they will be less concerned when
their railroad is completed, Â¦ for . then
they will have a means of their own
for handling freight across the conti
nent and I should not be a bit surprised
if they get a big share of it. They cer
tainly will until the canal is opened.
In all probability- the railroad .will en
ter into a traffic alliance with the Pa
cific Mall Steamship Company, but' as
yet no move In this direction has been
made."
Banker Solomon says Nicaragua is
now in a very prosperous condition,
thanks to the present administration,
which, he says, is doing everything
within its power to foster enterprises
and establish better trade relations
with foreign countries. From here
Banker Solomons will go to New Or
leans and from there return to Nica
ragua.
Among the recent arrivals at the St.
Francis Hotel is T- M. Solomons, . head
of a well known hanking firm of New
Orleans and Nicaragua. He is recog
nized as one of the most Influential
financiers of the Central American re
public, from which he has just come
with his wife on a pleasure trip. . Bank
er Solomons was mainly instrumental
in securing for the Nlcaraguan Gov
ernment a recent loan In this country
of $1,000,000, the most of which is to
be devoted to public Improvements in
the republic
"The principal improvement which
the Government Is planning,", said he
last evening, "is a cross country rail
road from San Ubaldo, on Lake Nic
aragua, to Monkey Point, on the At
lantic coast, a distance of about 110
miles, eighteen miles of the road have
already been oompleted and we expect
to have, the entire line ready for op

Fine Operatic Concert. ,
' Steinway Hall, was filled last night
with an enthusiastic audience that
listened to the operatic concert pro
gramme given under the direction of
Slgnor Gustavo Panlzza, who has for
many years conducted a school In this
city. . The chief - event of the even
ing was the ovation tendered Slgnor
Panizza, on his singing Cavatlna from
"Barbiere." This rendering was ; re
markable : owing to the fact that Slg
nor; Panizza is 7 7 . years old, and the
selection .a very difficult one. Signor
Avedano, .who . was . a ', tenor at the
Tivoli four years ago, .was also'onUhe
programme. The work of the, chorus
under Panizza called forth
much applause. â¢ The other partici
pants were: , Miss ' Stella ] Mariana.

One rather hoped for the Rles Per
petuo Mobile: for the encore, but some
one reached Mr. Kopta before me with
a reauest for ."The Cascade." Great
tun It Is, too, and was brilliantly given.
The Vleuxtemps "Balade et Polonaise
de Concert" closed Mr. Kopta's part of
the programme. The violinist was
cleverly and sympathetically accompa
nied by Gyula Ormay, whose work,
barring a bit of hardness and dryness
of tone, is entirely satisfactory.
Assisting Mr. Kopta was Miss Mande
Hohmann, soprano, a Californlan
singer, who made yesterday her debut
after some . years of Eastern study.
Miss Hohmann shows temperament in
her work, sincerity and modesty. Her
voice is good In quality and useful in
range. Nervousness doubtless .pre
cluded the best use of it yesterday, but
it is still evident that Miss Hohmann
has much to learn.. Her phrasing is
amateurish, her. shading curiously ex
aggerated, and her choice of songs net
wholly happy. The singer was at her
best in the dramatic Saint-Saens aria,
"My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice." but
the florid requirements of the Chami
nade "Summer" found Miss Hohmann
largely wanting, as also the lyric needs
of that charming lyric of Oscar Weil's
"Spring." Â¦
With next Sunday afternoon begin
the Kopta Quartet concerts, with the
Sindlng Piano Quintet as piece de re
sistance.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
The warm place that Wenzel Kopta
holds in the likings of the fiddle loving
public was . happily evident yesterday
afternoon in the hearty reception that
greeted him at his recital at Lyric
Hall. The .hall was not so. full as it
might have been, but the crowd was
both musical and enthusiastic.
It is possibly fancy, but ? to me ; the
character of Mr. Kopta's playing seems
to have more of the classical quality
than when I last heard It. And why
not? Kopta is not the kind of violinist
to stand still and this development
is - perhaps likelier than another with
that fiery youth of fifty! I felt it in the
Bazzini concerts' that opened the pro
gramme, a dignified and dramatic
work that promises much to further
acquaintance. With the Beethoven P
major romance it seemed to me that
I was quite sure of it. Mr. Kopta gave
the little movement with a breadth
and poise that I do not remember him
before to have brought to a Beethoven
rendering. '
Of course he was at his most likable
In the romanticism of the Tschaikow
sky. Canzonetta, played with charming
fteling and again most happy in the
rather melancholy and bizarre Slavisch
Dance of Dvorak. That he has lost
none of his old fire was apparent In
the spirited Pagnini stuffâ the adagio
and rondo (La Campanella) from the
Kopta's Recital Wins.

ow's ; cats : and "Her Last Rehearsal,",
which arithmetic adds up the bill as
one -of the best of the season. The
Dumond Minstrels furnishes one of
them. This time the favorite trio
needs relntroduction. The lank and
rakish fiddler has disappeared and in
his place. is the daughter of Monsieur,
the guitarist, plump, contralto and
trousered like a gamin. Madamoiselle
was a little nervous last night, but
seems to promise, with her pretty and
prettily used voice and naive and
charminsr personality, , an attractive
third in the trio. They were, as usual,
lavishly applauded, Monsieur, the fid
dler, with his. Irish and Scotch songs,
receiving a handsome share.
The other turn in particular is that
of W. J. Sullivan and Clarice Pasque
lena in "A Newsboy's Appeal." The
sketch Is not another "Skinny's Fin
ish," nor are Sullivan and Pasquelena
quite a Joe Tucker and Eva "Williams,
but they'll do all right. Miss Pasque
lena's tough girl is probably a good
deal more like the real thing than Miss
Williams'. In fact it might be a little
less realistic with advantage. But the
thing is as vital as a snapshot and no
end funny- â though vulgar. Mr. Sulli
van sings â well, if . he were on the
musical comedy Â¦ stage one would be
afraid of waking up. He has a pe
culiarly soft and pleasing tenor and
sings with nice feeling. v
The Harvey Comedy Company, in
"Wanted, a Groom," are also among
the new people. The sketch is well
acted and serves to amuse. Owley
and Randall break crockery in very
free-handed fashion in their juggling
act, which is rather original and com
ical.. Lewis McCord and his company
in "Her Last Rehearsal" have been
held over another week, with Jose
phine de Witt and Sinon and Â¦ Paris
and you can still take your cat to see
Techow's. He- shouldn't miss them,
nor you the rest.
