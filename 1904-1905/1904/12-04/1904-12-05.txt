Â£pec!al Diej*tch to The CÂ«.!t
NETV YORK, Dec. 4.â Frank S.
Black's partisans in the fight for Sena
tor Depew's seat in the United States
Eenate were more than ever confident
to-night that Black would be elected.
They asserted with great posltlveness
that both Governor-elect Higgins and
Epeaker Nixon would announce them
selves in favor of Black when the time
came ar.d they even went so far as
to predict that Senator Depew would
withdraw his name when he learned
bow heavy the odds- were against him.
This prediction was a surprise, in view
of the fact that Senator Depew has told
his fritnds that his^ name will go be
fore the Republican caucus, though he
fcas only one vote.
Governor-elect Higgins' arrival here
to-raorrcw is awaited with anxiety by
both sides. It is admitted that Higgins
has it in his power tcr settle the con
tent in favor of either Black or Sena
tor Depew, if he cares to exert his in-
Cuerce.
Higgins* affiliations have always been
â¢with the Platt wing of Republican
party and his closest friends are Platt
men. The advocates of the re-election
cf Senator Depew therefore deny that
there is any real basis for the assertion
of t>* Odcll nvru that Hiagi^M ~-hae
join-:J them in seeking: to bring about
'Black's election.
Black's friends said to-night that he
had received absolute pledges of sup
port from eiphty-six of the 140 Re
publican members, or fifteen more
than- majority in joint caucus.
They asserted, however, that he would
have 100 votes in caucus.
No direct answer was made by the
Black partisans to the assertion of Sen
ator Piatt that Governor Odell had
promised, a few weeks before the elec
tion, to do nothing to prevent the re
turn of Senator Depew, in return for
campaign contributions raised by Sena
to Depew and Senator Platt. The
amount of these contributions was said
to be $400,000. The Odell men admit
there was seme kind of an understand
ing, but they deny that it was specific
enough to be binding. Governor Odell
himself has refrained from either ad
mitting: or denying the truth of Sena
tor Plan's statement.

Brutal Attacks Upon Roosevelt and
McKinley During the Late
Campaign.
Special Dispatch to The Call
WASHINGTON". Dec. 4.â The sensa
tion on the eve of the reassembling: or
Congress is the strong effort being
made to refuse admittance to the
House of Representatives of a mem
ber-elect from the Fifth Congressional
district of Alabama. This is J. Thomas
Heflin, who was elected on November
S to serve- out the unexpired term of
Colonel Thompson, deceased. On Oc
tober 3, at Tuskogee, Ala., in the
course of a bitter and incendiary
speech assailing the Republican party
in general and Theodore Roosevelt in
particular, he said:
""There they sat, Roosevelt and Book
er, and if some Czolgoz or any of his
kind had thrown a bomb under the ta
ble no great harm would have been
done the country-"
Other extracts from the speeches of
Heflin have been collected and have
been placed before each member of the
Hojuse, and in a letter signed 'by Asa
E. Stratton of Montgomery, Ala., ac
companying these extracts, it is said:
"It Is respectfully submitted that J.
Thomas Heflin should not be permit
ted to take his seat in the House as
the successor of Hon. C. W.- Thomp
son from the Fifth Alabama District,
because of his anarchistic utterances
during the late political campaign."
The writer mentions the " Tuskogee
speech, and continues:
"He further ' said. In speaking of the
possibility of Booker Washington tak
ing part in the campaign: *If Booker
takes a hand in this thing it will be
one time I will ask him to step out. I
will ask him to keep hands off, and
you know we have a way of influencing
negroes down here.'
"It is aLso reported that he said on
another occasion, in speaking of the
Statesboro (Ga.) affair, that it was
but a sending off of a few more Re
publicans, singing, 'Nearer, My God,
to Thee,' a brutal allusion to the
death of President McKinley. The
extracts are but in an index to the
man's character ar.d life."
The opinion which appears to prevail
among members here is that Heflin is
an unfit person to be in the House, but
that to refuse him admittance would
be to make a "martvr" of him. and
thus gratify his taste for notoriety. It
would not be surprising, however, if.
when Heflin presents himself â  before
the bar of the House to be sworn in,
objection be made and. as in the case
of Roberts of Utah, he may have to
stand aside and await report of the
elections committee as to whether he
is a proper person to admit to mem
bership.

Pacific Mail Pact Is
Under Consid

Abrogation ol Panama Rail

pears Probable.
Canal Commission Expects Strong
Opposition From the Harri
man Interests.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.â The Presi
dent has under consideration the ques
tion of abrogating the contract be
tween the Panama Railroad and the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company. A
report has been made by the Isthmian
Canal Commission, though the com
mission does not make definite recom
mendations. Questions of policy are
involved which will require the per
sonal decision of the President, after a
consultation with Secretary Taft- Â»
It Is understood that the canal com
missioners have reported to the Presi
dent that, in their opinion, an increase
of business would result from the 1
abrogation of the contract with the
Pacific Mail because of the lower rates
that would be offered by tramp steam
ships competing with the Pacific Mail.
These low rates would attract much
overland business and the probable re
sult would be a lowering of transcon
tinental railroad rates to meet this
competition. The Pacific Mail itself, if
it follow its precedents, will cut rates
to drive away competition on the west
ern coast. â¢:';*
The canal commissioners expect to
encounter the strongest opposition from
the Harriman interests' in their elToi ts
to terminate the contract.
A' -member of the commission hinted
to-day that if the railroad interests
should appoint Benjamin .B. Odell Jr.
president of the Pacific -Mail in the
hope that he would use his- influence
with the President to continue the con
tract, they were doomed to disappoint
ment. No intimation has come from
the President regarding his attitude
on the subject, but Secretary Taft has
indicated that in due time the relations
of thÂ«? Panama Railroad and the Pa
cific Mail would be severed.

ROME, Dec. 4. â The infant Crown
Prince of Italy was baptized at the
"Quirinal to-day. The /> weather was
showery, but this . did â â  not prevent a
great crowd gathering Jat the palace
to witness the passage of the carriages
with their destinguished occupants.
The ballroom of the Quirlnal, which
had been transformed into a chapel,
was beautifully decorated. The altar
stood at the end of the room, with
six immense golden candlesticks and a
crucifix in the center. ..'Above the altar
was a picture of '"The 'Madonna and
Child," which had been -taken from
the Quirinal .chapeL . . ;' ,/
Vl On either 'Side -of* th*j0 tip's leading
to the altar were three pyramids of ex
quisite white' flowers, joined by gar
lands of. the same .blossoms. The
space, between the windows was bank
ed with flowers, making a .perfect
bower. Before -the altar Were rows of
gilded chairs. On the left of the altar
was a box for the Princesses Yolande
and Mufalda and for the other chil
dren of the court. Under this. In red
brocade with palms, was another box
for diplomats whose countries had
sent royal representatives, such as
Great Britain, Germany, Portugal and
Servia. The diplomats from other
countries were ... not invited. Opposite
this box and on the other side of the
altar was a box for wearers of the
collar of the Annunzlata, who rank as
cousins of the King. A special balcony
was provided for the royal couple.
CARRIED OX LiACE PILLOW.
When all the guests had assembled
sixteen canons and the court chaplain
entered processionally, taking their
places at the altar. Immediately after
the appearance of the clergy the doors
of the private apartments of the pal
ace were opened to allow the royal
cortege, headed by the master of cere
monies and the prefect of the palace,
to pass. Countess Bruschi-Falgari,
lady in waiting, carried the Crown
Prince in an exquisite lace embroidery
robe and lying on a lace pillow/
With the King and Queen were the
Prince of Montenegro, dressed 'as a
Cbspador with a rich Montenegrin cos
tume, and his three daughters, Princess
Helen of Servia, the Dowager Duchess
of Genoa, great-grandmother of the
Crown Prince, Prince Albert of Prus
sia, Prince Arthur of Connaught.
Prince Victor Napoleon; the Duke of
Genoa, the Count of Turin and others.
The spectacle was a magnificent one.
All the ladies present, including those
of the royal party, were dressed in
white with creamy lace veils "on their
heads, their persons glittering with
jewels. The uniforms of the diplomatic
and military representatives gave an
added tone of color. The effect was
heightened by the exquisite music of a
quintet.
CRIES OUT BUT OXCE.
The baptismal ceremony was most
picturesque. Countess Brushi-Falgari
came slowly forward with the Infant,
who was taken by the Queen, who ad
vanced before the altar. At the -same
time the King stepped forward to the
box occupied by, the royal children and
lifted out. the Princesses Yolande "and
Mufalda, whom he kept beside him dur
ing the entire ceremony, which . they
watched with wide eyed interest.
Dowager Queen Margharita, the God
mother, and Prince Nicholas of Mon
tenegro, the godfather, stood on. either
side of the Queen, 'with one hand on the
Crown Prince's shoulder and a. candle
in the other. The ceremony lasted fif
teen minutes and the crown . Prince
acted splendidly, his only outcry being
when, he felt the holy water upon his
forehead.
After the ceremony King Victor Em
manuel kissed . his . little son . and . the
Queen made the round of the room to
show the Crown' Prince to everybody.
Then with deep bows to the altar and
,the assembly the. royal party retired.

CALL. BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON.
WASHINGTON, Dec 4.â The announce
ment of the. decision in the .case of/the
Pennsylvania Railroad and the "Western
Union Telegraph .Company, so stub
bornly fought, up to the court of last re
sb'rt, ls^expected'tormofow in ;the Su
preme Court of the United States. The
belief is general â¢ in : Washington to
night that the case will go against the
Western Union Company, and one ru
mor has it that ' the court \ is almost
unanimously in favor of the Pennsylva
nia Railroad contention, there being
but one dissenting opinion.
'The case involves the removal of the
Western Union telegraph poles from all
property controlled by the Pennsylva
nia Railroad, and, incidentally, a very
stiff flght between President Cassatt of
the railroad and all Gould interests. At
the expiration of the term of lease
agreed unon the Pennsylvania notified
the Western Union officials that their
poles must be removed along' the line
of the road in' Pennsylvania. The tele
graph company refused to do this, and
the railroad officials ordered their men
to cut down the poles without â¢ further
delay. This was done,' and the result
was a case in court. '
The lower courts -and the United
States Court of Appeals found in favor
of the railroad, and it is now expected
here that the Â« Supreme Court of the
United States will sustain these deci
sions, holding that the road -had the
right to exclude the telegraph poles
from its property at the end of the term
of lease.
If this be the decision it â  means a
victory for the railroad company and
the probable exclusion of Western Un
ion wires and poles from all property
controlled by the railroad, whether in
the State of Pennsylvania or not. In
some States the leases have not yet ex
pired.

PANAMA. Dec 4.â The difficulties
between the United States and Pana

tha canal zone or the republic of Pana
ma can enter the ports established by

tended the same privileges in the
canal ports.
GOLD STANDARD REQUIRED.
Complete jurisdiction is granted the
United States in the harbors of Colon
and Panama as to sanitation and quar
antine regulations.
Panama reduces her rate of postage
to 2 cents and is to furnish all stamps
in the republic and in the canal zone.
The zone authorities are to purchase
stamps from Panama at 40 per cent of
their face value.
The order of Secretary Taft is to be
Ineffective unless Panama shall put
into effect the gold standard, according
to the currency agreement of June 20,
1904. It also makes' a stipulation re
garding: citizenship rights to Pana
mans in the canal zone and provi
sion is alsu made in the order for
maintenance by the United States of

DR. CHADWICK
LOYAL TO WIFE
Cables From Europe That
Statements Eeflecting on
Her Life Are Not True
WOMAN BEING WATCHED
Secret Service Agent Takes
Up Station in the Holland
House in New York City
NEW YORK, Dec. 4.â Dr. Leroy S.
Chadwick, the husband of Caesie L.
Chadwick, whose financial troubles
have been undergoing the threshing
out process for the past week, has
come out with a brief statement from
Europe. To-day he cabled to Philip
Carpenter, Mrs. ChadwicK's counsel,
from some place abroad, the name of
which Carpenter would not disclose,
requesting that gentleman "to deny the
published statments reflecting on Mrs.
Chadwick's life and character. They
are absolutely false." The cahlegram
reads :
I wish to have it understood that I stand by
Mrs. Chadwick in every particular in her pres
ent troubles. I feel that she has bÂ«en greatly
wror~ed by the publication and I believe she
is being: persecuted by some of her creditors.
Dr. Chadwlck explained that he had
dispatched his cablegram just as soon
as he saw the report of his wife's
troubles.
Carpenter also made a statement to
day. Said he:
Dr. Chadwick is abroad for his health and
the Newton suit was not brought until some
three weeks aJter he sailed. Before going
away Dr. Chadwick consulted me in regard
to Newton's claim and with him I met New
ton and his Boston attorney. The matter was
then arranged, seemingly to the satisfaction
of all concerned, and then the doctor sailed.
All the members of the doctor's family are
standing by Mrs. Chadwick loyally, and are
In entire sympathy with her. I know that Dr.
Chadwick would be by his "wife's Bide, looking
out for her. If he were in this country.
Mrs. Chadwick has acted in the most hon
orable way In all her dealings that have come
to my knowledge. One very good evidence of
this is found in the unshaken confidence still
reposed In hejr by her largest creditors and
those who know her besti
MRS, CHADWICK PROSTRATED.
Mrs. Chadwick remained in her room
In the Holland House all day. Dr.
Moore, her physician, called in the
morning and found Mrs. Chadwick in
a highly nervous state. Her condition
was such that Dr. Moore called a con
sultant and they made a thorough ex
amination. The medical men found no
organic trouble, but said that 'the pa
tient was ajmost prostrated from the
exciting events of the past week. They
will keep close watch on her during
the n*Â»xt few days.
In the afternoon Philip Carpenter
was admitted to the sick room and
had a long conference with Mrs. Chad
wick. He went over the various
phases of the case with her, especially
those points which have to do with
the bankruptcy "case in Cleveland. As
a result of this conference Carpenter
decided to notify all small clients that
their claims would be paid this week
and he called up the attorney for a
local, millinery i.h.ouse^jy&ich procured
an 'attachment ngatnst^ the Cleveland
woman and notified him of his inten
tion.
Simultaneously with the announce
ment - from Cleveland that President
Beckwith of the suspended Citizens'
National Bank of Oberlin was to be
placed under arrest, an official of the
United States Secret Service appeared
at the Holland House and took up his
station there. When recognized he
declared that he was. sent to the hotel
hurriedly and that he had been given
no orders.
After having a long talk on the
telephone, the secret service man said
he was not Interested in the Chadwick
case, but declined absolutely to an
nounce the nature of his mission.
Kmil, the young: son of Mrs. Chad
wick, who has been staying near his
mother for several days, was the sub
ject of some Inquiry to-day. It â  was
said that he had left the hotel. This
could not be verified. It was rumored
that the boy had left town with the
jewels alleged to belong to his moth
er and that she would follow him to
night or to-morrow. This was denied
by Carpenter, who said that his client
would remain in New York at least
through Monday.
BANKERS UNDER ARREST. -
CLEVELAND, Dec. 4.â As the result
of the extended conference between
the United States District Attorney,
the bank examiners who have been
looking into the affairs of the failed
Citizens' Bank of Oberlin and their
counsel, which lasted until late last
night and all of to-day, President C.
T. Beckwith and Cashier Spear of that
bank were placed under arrest to-day
by United States Marshal Chandler of
Cleveland at their homes at Oberlin.
Marshal Chandler personally tools
charge of the warrants and several
deputies accompanied him.
The arrests of Beckwith and Spear
are the first that have been made in
the Chadwick case. The Citi2ens' Na
tional Bank, with which they are con
nected, is a creditor to the extent of
$240,000 of Mrs. Cassie L. Chadwick.
The bank is capitalized at but $60,000.
Since the disclosure of the bank's deal
ings with Mrs. Chadwick, the, presi
dent, cashier and directors ; have held
conferences and meetings frequently.
The warrants on which Beckwlth and
Spear were arrested charge them .with
violation of the Federal banking > laws.
President â ' Beckwith \ took his arrest
quietly. Mrs. Beckwith collapsed and
became bo ill that a physician -was
called in.~ Neither banker? was locked

Special; Cable to The Call and New York

ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 5, 2 a. m.
Neither the Admiralty nor the "War
Office is able to confirm the report
from Chefu that the Japanese have
been unable to hold 203-Meter Hill,
but this news is quite in accordance
with expectations. Experts here are
convinced that the capture of 203-
Meter Hill will be of no advantage to
the Japanese unless they can gain pos
session of the neighboring forts.
Nevertheless, the tone of the talk
about Port Arthur is pessimistic. Gen
eral Heisman, for Instance, says that
even if they can no longer defend the
walls crumbling about their ears, the
defenders of Port Arthur will have
written one of the most glorious pages
in Russian history.
Xemirovlch Dachenko writes that
the situation is very critical, but not
hopeless. The Russians still hold two
lines of defense. When these are lost
they can fall back upon Liaoshan.
In the opinion of many other ex
perts, General Stoessel will make his
final stand in the last named fort.
General Grippenberg has started
from Harbin for Mukden to meet Gen

story has developed in which it ap
pears that -none of those connected
with it intended to harm any other
person, but were working: for the
other's good.
Mrs. J. W. Humphreys had long ex
pressed a desire for a blue-eyed baby
girl and tried to induce Mrs. Sadie
Shaw to consent to the adoption of her
daughter, but the latter declined. She,
however, agreed to nnd a baby girl
for Mrs. Humphreys if she wanted to
adopt a child. Husband Humphreys
objected strongly and said he would
have no adoptions. His wife, however,
supposed she could induce him to per
mit her to keep a child if a baby was
left Upon the door step and she and
Mrs. Shaw entered into an agreement
whereby the latter agreed to find a
baby and leave it there.
Mrs. Shaw came to Los Angeles, found
a blue-eyed girl baby two weeks old,
took it to Redlands Friday night and
delivered it upon the doorstep of the
Humphreys' home. Husband Hum
phreys, however, would have no found
lings and was about to turn the young
ster over to the police when Mrs, Shaw
telephoned to ask if the baby had been
found, thus exposing her connection
with the case; A demand was imme
diately made that she return and take
away the child, which she did; but that
did not end It. Humphreys did not know
about the conspiracy between the two
women, and gave his side of the story
to the newspapers. Then Mrs. Shaw
retaliated by producing written instruc
tions from Mrs. Humphreys as to what
to do and where to leave the baby.
Mrs. Shaw still has the child and
says she will keep it.

Garrison Contests
Every Inch of
Ground
Terrific Fighting for
a Port Arthur
Hill.
TOKIO, Dec. 4.â The diary of the
fighting around 203-Meter Hill, which
Is published in the Japanese papers,
describes the terrible losses involved
in the storming of the Russian position
from dawn of November 28 until 11
o'clock In the forenoon of that day. A
Russian counter-attack was begun at
dawn on November 29 and was so
furiously pressed that the Japanese
were compelled to retire into the val
ley.
The attack was renewed the morn
ing of November 30, "when all the
Japanese reserves came up," from the
southwestern corner, but the assail
ants had advanced only thirty meters
by 5 o'clock, so stubborn was the re
sistance and the Japanese suffered se
vere losses.
Then, being reinforced, the Japanese
maintained the struggle with terrible
earnestness. Furious charges -were
made repeatedly and the Russians
were compelled -gradually to retire. The
southwestern summit of the hill was
not occupied until 7 o'clock in the even
ing and the northwestern summit not
until H o'clock.
During the night six Russian coun
ter-attacks were repulsed. One, which,
was launched at 4 o'clock In the morn
ing, was characterized by several bay
onet attacks and was persisted in until
noon of December 1, when, the hope
lessness of the attempts becoming evi
dent, the Russians retired.

lined the route of the procession,
which was from St. Patrick's to Sr.
Mary's and then to St. Joseph's
Church.
Dr. F. C. Gerlach wa* grrand mar
shal. In line were the children of the
various Catholic schools and Sunday
schools and the Ladies' and Gentle

Mary's and St. Joseph's churches and
the aitar boys, singers and priests. At
St.^Joseph's Church Father Sasia of

feature of the day was the blessing of
the crown of the Blessed Virgin by
Father Sasia.

Steven H. Clark Tears Out
Boards From Wall to Gain
Freedom From His Prison
Steven H. Clark, an insane man held
at the Central Emergency Hospital,

end made a violent endeavor to
brain Steward John Devere. With
the assistance of Policeman Har
rtll and W. Mundell. a re
porter, the crazy man was subdued
only after a terrible drubbing, in the
administering of which his face was
cut severely. Clark had been violent
at times and was kept in a strait
Jacket. Last evening he complained of
pains and the jacket was removed so
hÂ«Â» could rest. A short time after, that
the matron, Mrs. H- Swett, heard a
crash in the Insane ward. She rushed
In and saw Clark climbing through a
Bnoall aperture he had made by tearing
down the boards between his cell and
the nest one. The walls are built of
heavy two-inch pine planks, though
they are not adequate in strength for
the incarceration of lunatics.
The insane man stood his bed on end
and with the characteristic strength of
a demented man wrenched three boards
from their position.
Mrs. Swett notified Steward Devere
and Policeman Harrell. who went to
the cell. Clark had climbed into the
next cell, which was, fortunately, va
cant. The door was unlocked, but the
prisoner did not discover the fact. As
Devere pulled the door open Clark
t prang forward, brandishing one of the
heavy planks. The steward and the
officer closed in and. after a desperate
struggle In which Clark was beaten
into a semi-conscious condition, over
powered him.
It is impossible to see how Clark
wrenched the heavy boards from the
partition. He has been in the hospital
for several days and suffers from the
hallucination that he is the greatest
inventor of the age. He cays he has
an airship that will go to China in

Origin of Russia's Emblem.
The two-headed eagle, which is the
emblem of Russia, has an ancient ori
gin in symbolism, if not in natural his
tory. It is traceable to primitive Bab
ylonia, and is found on Hittlte monu
ments of Cappadocia; it was adopted
by Turkoman Princes, and also brought
to Europe by crusaders in the four
teenth century. Apparently the . Ger
man Emperors â¢ got It from crusaders
and passed it on to Russia and Austria.

THE -SAN PRANCISCO CALU, â  MONDAY,. DECEMBER 5, 1904.
Like a monster full of life, the airship
California Messenger, constructed by
George E. Heaten, flew about in Ala
meda for several hours yesterday. Its
flight was over the large field north of
the tidal canal and west of Park ave
nue. She obeved her steering and pro
pelling apparatus in a manner highly
satisfactory to the inventor.
Heaten went up in his aerial craft
for the first time and put the vessel
through a series of evolutions that in
cluded soaring, descending, turning
about, traveling in a straight line and
in a circle. Nearly a thousand persons
witnessed" the flight, and" many ex
pressed the opinion that the designer
and buider of the craft has come near
solving the problem of a dirigible air-
Heaten had inflated the mammoth '
balloon of the vessel with almost 10,000 j
cubic feet of hydrogen gas, and its
buoyancy easily lifted the craft and the
operator, who weighed 150 pounds. To
lessen the chances of an accident long
ropes were fastened to the vessel during
the maneuvers above the earth, the
lines being held by Heaten's assistants, j
who were forced to run rapidly when I
the craft was moving ahead at -half- !
speed. , ;
Owing to the atmospheric conditions
the gasoline engine that drives the pro- i
pelling fans of the airship gave Heaten â¢
some trouble for a time by stopping j
when he was high above the ground, j
but the inventor says he can prevent a j
recurrence of the annoyance by altera- j
tions to the engine. After coming down j
from his initial ascension Heaten took j
two of his small children in the basket ;
of the airship and made- a short flight !
for the purpose of giving their mother !
an opportunity to take a snapshot of â¢.
the vessel and its occupants. I
In discussing his aerial vessel Heaten
eaid:
I feel that I have come Â»s near as Santos
Dumont and other builders of airships to mak
ing one than can be controlled. My vessel dif
fers from ethers in Its motive power and in the
construction of its guiding machinery. The en
gine was designed by me and is capable of de
veloping 15-horseix>wer, although it weighs but
64 pounds.

WILL INDICT
YOUNG WEBER
Auburn Grand Jury Prepared
to Charge the Youth With
the Murder of His Father
SEAECH FOE LOST GOLD
officers Believe Coin Miss
ing From the Alleged Bank
Funds Is in San Francisco
Special Dispatch to The Call.
'AUBURN. Dec 4.â The Grand Jury
to-morrow will bring in an indictment
against Adolph J. Weber for the killing
of his father. On the same day young
Weber will have his hearing before
Judge Prewett on the charge of killing
his mother. The jury will not attempt
to bring in any further indictments be
cause of a Supreme Court decision
which says that where a first indict
ment found by a Grand Jury is not re
submitted to it for correction, or not re
submitted at all, the same jury which
found the first indictment is disqualified
from finding a second one. The District
Attorney will advise the present Grand
Jury that it would be use'less for it to
bring in an indictment against Weber
on the bank robbery charge.
A neighbor of the Webers to-day said
that Adolph Weber had not spoken to
his sister Bertha for several months
prior to her death. He seldom spoke
to any of the family. On one occasion,
it is said, when Adolph was lvlng upon
the lounge at his home his little^valid
brother while playing bumped into him.
Immediately Adolph flew Into a rage
and struck the helpless boy. Young
Weber on another occasion remarked
to a companion that he was tired of
living at home, tired of his people, that
they were not congenial and that he
was going to make other arrangements.
A thorough search has been 'made of
the Weber premises for the 5825 that is
missing from the sum supposed to have
been stolen from the bank by Weber.
The officers believe that it has either
been found and not reported or that the
money is somewhere in San Francisco.
When the Weber family left last June
for San Francisco Adolph did not go on
the same train with the rest of the fam
ily, but took a train five hours later.
The officers think that he stayed behind
in order to take some of the stolen bank
money with him. It may be, the officers
say, that he has the money deposited
somewhere in San Francisco under an
alias, or possibly with some friend.

DETECTIVES AEE BUSY
Not- a Trace of the Missing
Casli Is Found in jtfoxes
Sent to Eastern Points
The detectives of Wells, Fargo & Co.
were turned loose yesterday in search
of the man or men guilty of stealing
the 515,000 which mysteriously disap
peared a week ago from the forwarding
department of the express company. All
hope that the missing money might be
eventually found in one of the east
bound coin safes, where it was thought
it might have been placed by mistake,
was abandoned yesterday.
Early in the morning reports had
been received from all points to which
coin safes were shipped on the day the
coin disappeared. The money had not
been accounted for, and the only theory
left for the officials of the company was
that -it had been made away with by
some one. Discussing the matter yes
terday one" of the officials of the com
pany said the theory of theft was re
luctantly accepted by the company.
"As we have repeatedly statod," said
he, "We have directed suspicion against
no employe of the company. It is hard
to believe that one of our men would
have betrayed the trust reposed in
him, for in the coin department the
majority of the employes have been
there for many years, some as far back
as 1868, and during their long career
with the company they have handled
sums of money far in excess of the
amount stolen last week. Of course, .we
do not mean in any way to intimate
that one of these men is guilty of tht
theft. There is every reason, however,
for believing that the money was
stolen, and it now rests with the spe
cial officers of the company to deter
mine who is the guilty person."
Among the men employed in the for
warding department it has been sus
pected from the start that the $15,000
was stoleri> and they all keenly feel the
position they have been placed in. How
one man could have got away with the
$15,000 without attracting the notice of
the large number of employes in that
department is a mystery. It is gener
ally conceded that an outsider could not
have carried it off, and it seems to the
officials of the company almost impos
sible that -one of the employes could
have had a confederate outside the
counter and passed the bag of money
to him without arousing suspicion.

TORPEDO OMLY
AN AUXILIARY
Navy Board Holds That the
Battleship Continues to Be
the Mistress of the Seas
MORTOX MAKES EEPOET
Would Put Younger Men in
Command; Favors Creation
of Two Vice Admirals
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.â Secretary of
the Navy Morton in his annual report,
made public to-day, says the naval es
timates for the fiscal year are large, the
largest ever submitted, notwithstanding
the fact that they have been cut down
from those sent in by the bureaus more
than $17,000,000. He adds:
The past year was an important one In thÂ«
history of our naval construction. Never be
fore were so many warships launched by this
or any other nation In on* year. Vessel for
vessel and type for type. I believe our new
ships . will compare favorably with those of
any navy afloat and every American should
be proud of the progress and character of th*
work now being accomplished, not only In
construction, but in all branches of the ser
vice.
New ships necessarily require more officers,
more marines and more enlisted men and the
appropriations are quite likely to increase
steadily for some years to come. The more
ships we have Â»he greater our fixed charges
will be and the greater our facilities necessarily
must be, Â«n the way of yards and docks and
the ability to make repairs and take proper
care of the fleet.
It costs a great deal of money to keep the
fleet <uovin? in maneuvers and target prac
tice. bi:t this is the only way officers and men
can gain experience at sea and It is our well
defined policy to maintain a high standard of
efficiency throughput the service.
Last year the navy cost a little over a dol
lar per capita. It cost littte compared to what
war would cost and it is the best Insurance
we have against ws>r. We want such a navy
in style, size and "sand" that no other navy
will ever desire an engagement with us. It
is our greatest exhibit in favor of peace.
HEAVY GUNS EFFECTIVE.
The Ussons of the war In the East thus far
are the same as those of the Spanish war
with respect to the relative value and uses
of battleships, torpedo-boats and destroyers.
Weight of metal, heavy guns and hard hitting-,
whether at long or short range, still do the
most effective work. The day of the battle
ship Is not over and the sphere of the lighter
vessels, vrhile Important. Is auxiliary only.
These conclusions, reached by the general
board and the board of construction, as the
result of careful study of naval progress and
present conditions in the light of the events
of the past few months In Eastern seas, con
firm In a most striking manner your own
views on the subject expressed more than two
and a half years aso.
Secretary Morton then quotes from
the President's letter, in. the course of
which the President said:
Nothing could be more foolish than the talk
of substituting torpedo boats for battleships
and cruisers. Except when working at night
or under conditions which favor a surprise, the
torpedo boat is absolutely helpless against any
seagoing anip armed with rapid-tire guns,
whether the ship be large or small, and under
no circumstances Is it lit to do rough work at
sea. or to perform, any of the duties taken as a
matter of course by regular seagoing craft.
The Secretary continuing: says:
The general board and the Board of Con
struction, after weighing the result of recert
developments, have reached conclusions in full
accord with those expressed by you In the pa
per above quoted, and a schedule of naval con
struction In harmony with these views will be
submitted later.
It is only fair to say the work now being
done by the < : general --"board. -with. Admiral
Dfwty at Its, Read.- la; directly- In the line of
preparation for war and. Is of the greatest
value.
FAVORS YOUNGER MEN.
Secretary Morton says that our in
terests in the Far Bast and elsewhere
have become so Important that the
navy should have one or more officers
of high rank ' available for service
wherever their presence may be appro
priate, and he concurs in the recom
mendation of the chief of the Bureau
of Navigation that provision should be
made for two vice admirals of the
navy.
Secretary Morton also concurs with
the chief of the Bureau of Navigation
in the opinion that officers of the navy
attain command rank too late in life,
and on this subject says:
It is no disparagement of the senior officers
of the service to say tnat we should have
younger men in command of our ships in time
of peace as well as in time of war.
Secretary Morton reports satisfactory
progress of work on vessels building at
navy yards, but says:
It is the oplnicn of the chief constructor
that ships built by the Government at navy
yards will cost more money than if built at
private yards by contract.
He concurs, however, with the chief
constructor in the view that the repair
ing and overhauling of naval vessels
must remain the important work of the
navy yards, and that there should be
no change in the policy of building pub
lic ships, as a general rule, by contract
at private establishments. Of naval gun
factories he says:
The maintenance of a public naval gun fac
tory in a state of such efficiency as to be ca
pable of turning out guns of all calibers re
quired for the armament of naval vessels is
undoubtedly desirable. The Government should
not necessarily^enter the Industrial field. The
development in time of peace of large private
establishments, with extensive plants and a
force of rkllled artisans capable of building
ships of the first class, making armor of the
best quality in all weights, and constructing
guns of every kind and supplying fixed ammu
nition therefor is desirable Inasmuch as the
existence of such establishments may be of Im
portant service in time of war.

CONGRESS WILL
CONVENE TO-DAY
Little Will Be Accomplished
During the .First Week
in the Senate or House
3EESSAGE ON TUESDAY
Knox of Pennsylvania and
Crane of Massachusetts to
Sit in the Upper Body
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.â The first
act of the Senate, which will convene
to-morrow, will be one of respect to
the memory of two distinguished Sen
ators â Senator Quay and Senator
Hoar. Adjournment for the day will
follow at once and thus postpone the
receipt of the President's annual mes
sage until Tuesday. That document
will be received early Tuesday and
very little if anv further business be
yond its reading and the induction
into office of Knox of Pennsylvania
and Crane of Massachusetts will be
undertaker, that .lu,*. 1'ci the remain
der of- the week exceedingly brief
sessions are expected. On Thursday
adjournment will be taken until the
following Monday.
OLD BILLS IX LINE.
Senator Lodge will press the House
bill for the Philippines Government as
soon as it is possible to got that meas
ure before the Senate, and he has
announced . his intention not to brook
opposition to its consideration. The
bill has the vast advantage of being
on 4he calendar as unfinished business,
so that it cannot easily be displaced.
It is not probable, however, that
Lodge now will attempt more with
reference to it than to give notice of
his intention to press its adoption.
Before the close of the session last
spring- Senator Hoar gave notice that
on next Tuesday he would call up the
bill providing means for the protec
tion of the President, but owing to
the death of the Senator consideration
of the bill will be, deferred for some
time. Senator Heyburn gave notice
last session that he would call up the
pure food bill next Tuesday, but while
it is generally understood that he will
press the question at all proper times,
it is believed he will not make serious
effort to proceed with it during the
first few days of the session. Another
measure which probably will be taken
up early in the session is the bill for
admission of the four southwest terri
tories as two States.
XEW COMMITTEE MEMBERS.
Nothing more than preliminary
work,' however, can be done on any of
these bills in the first week.
It is expected that the Republican
steering committee will give attention
to the order of business early in the
session with a view to general legis
lation betore the appropriation bills
begin to arrive from the House of
Representatives. Attention will be
given to filling committee vacancies
caused by the deaths of Senators Han
na, Hoar and Quav. but the disposi
tion seems to be opposed to doing more
in that direction at'present than to
parsing to Senator Platt of Connecti
cut the chairmanship of the Committee
on Judiciary, which place will - go to
him by virtue of seniority.
Monday will be characterized as
usual by the attendance of a large
number of spectators and a liberal dis
play of flowers on the desks of Sena
tors.
MIXOR IiEGISLATIOX.
Little in the way of legislative busi
ness is expected the first week of the
session of the House. The first day
will be devoted to calling the roll and
swearing in of new members who have
been elected to fill vacancies. The
usual committee will be appointed to
inform the President that Congress is
in session and the resolution notifying
the Senate that a quorum of the
House is ready for business will be
passed. Tuesday the President's mes
sage will be read, but it is not expected
that any other business will be trans
acted. . :.-.'- â '.[â â â 
There are a number of minor mat*
ters of legislation that may be con
sidered on Wednesday and on Thurs
day, as ho special order has been made
for consideration of any general meas
ure. It is possible that the legislative,
executive and judicial appropriation
bill may be reported Wednesday or
Thursday. Friday is pension day, and
there will be more than a thousand
private pension bills < ready for the
House to consider.
Early adjournments each day are ex
pected during the first week in order
to give time to shape the session busi
ness.
Morton says it is. a question that can
not by any means be regarded as set
tled adversely. Of Guam he says:
It is believed that Congress should provide a
form of government for the island without de
lay and give to its people that sense of security
in property and business affairs which can
come only from permanent laws and a form
of government in harmony with that of the
country to which the island belongs.

Will Not Baise the Price a
Dollar Over the "All Cash
Sale" Prices of Last Week
e
Fifty dollars down and fifteen per
month, at the same desperate low
prices they were sold last week In our
"all caah sale," will take anything:
left in the Weber line, and some of
the finest, most beautiful and costly
[ Webers of the entire lot â amons
which three choice art styles, includ-
ing the beautiful "Louie 14th" â are yet
for sale; and if but a few of the many
[ Weber admirers who called last week
t during the "all cash sale." with a
view of paying part cash, and balance
en time, will call again, they may be
accommodated now on easy terms at
the same price.
Our ten days' sale of Webers at a
discount of $163 to $260 for spot cash.
! disposed of most of these elegant pi-
i anos, and brought us in practically all
I the cash we needed (in arranging for
| the new line of pianos to take the
' place of the Weber), or so nearly all.
! that the payments down required to
! close out the rest on time, will give
I us ample cash to carry out our new
j enterprise.
j Therefore, every piano from thÂ»
Weber concern. Including the Weber.
Wheelock and Stuyvesant. will be dis-
posed of at once, without raising the
j price one dollar over the sacrifice sale
I prices at which they were offered and
! sold last week for all cash; and we
! will make the terms $50 down, and
! $15 per month, on such of the "Web-
t er" styles as cost us over S300, and
I all other styles and makes, including
t Wheelock and Stuyvesant. costing us
i less than $300. and on down to $106,
| may go on terms of $25 down, and $10
i per month â without the raise of a
â¢ dollar over the all cash sale prices.
i No matter how fine the "Weber"
line of pianos are. as we no longer
hold the agency for them, we don't
want a single instrument of that line
on our fioor a minute longer than it
takes to sell it at what it will cost Us
to set it in the house of the buyer.
Now here is the golden opportunity
â the one opportunity of a lifetime
(and that's no josh, either) â to buy
< one of the finest high-grade pianos in
the world, without sugaring anybody'3-7-
pockets at this end of the line, and buy
it on time at that
We haven't many Webers left, but
what we have got is very fine, fresh
and new, and in the rarest of fancy
woods â mahogany, rosewood and curly
walnutâ each accompanied by its fac-
tory guarantee, and shall prove a per-
! feet gem of its class, or no sale. -
Remember, we are no longer the
"Weber" agents, and to protect and
hold up their prices, when the agency
Is so soon to go into the bands of an-
other (even though a friendly com-
petitor) could not be expected; and in
our all-cash sale just closed, we cut
every dollar off the price that it was
possible to cut without actually los-
ing money, and while we cannot cut
any further, there's nothing more to
cut â we're at the bottomâ but we'll
â¢ stay there, and sacrifice the rest of thi a
fine Weber line of pianos at the same-
; price, on easy payments as above.
See what we can do for you for $267,
on terms of $25 down and $10 pe>
-month.
I This sale should last but a few days,
j certainly not longer than this week,
1 and if you think piano, think "Weber";

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, Dec. 4.
Despite the rain, the exercises in
connection with the dedication of the
First Christian Church this afternoon
were witnessed by a throng that
crowded the handsome edifice to over
flowing. Prominent ministers of the
denomination from distant points were
in attendance, participating in the
ceremonies. President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler of the State University deliv
ered the principal address. Ministers
of other churches in Berkeley occupied
seats in the pulpit during the services
and took part in the exercises.
The Christian Church building is at
Dana street and Bancroft way, and is
deemed one of the handsomest in
Berkeley. It is of classic design, in
harmony with the style of architecture
adopted by the trustees of the Bible
seminary, which is to adjoin the church
later- Its spacious hall hardly sufficed
to house the throng which gathered
this morning to take part in the open
ing service under the direction of the
Rev. E. W. Darst.
A large choir provided special music
during the day's services. Mrs. A. M.
Klston rendered a solo in the morning.
Professor Clinton Morse In the after
noon and Mrs. C. A. Meek in the even

GRADUATION CLASS AT THE I
SUNDAY-SCHOOL. OF FIRST BAP- .
TIST CHURCH. OAKLAND. J
OAKLAND, Dec. 4.â The celebration
of the golden jubilee anniversary of the
organization of the First Baptist
Church, the oldest Protestant church
in Oakland, began to-day at the new
"home of the congregation on Twenty
first street and Telegraph avenue, and
will continue until Sunday evening,
December 11. The celebration began
with a morning service at the church.
This service was opened with the sing
ing of Stainer's famous cantata, "The
Crucifixion," by a chorus choir of fifty
voices under the direction of Percy A.
R. Dow. The solo parts were rendered
by Scott Kent and Norman. Pendleton,
tenors, and Reginald Marrack and
Walter Burckhalter, barytones.
At the conclusion of the cantata the
pastor, the Re\). Homer J. Vosburgh,
addressed the congregation, telling of
the growth and work of the First Bap
tist Church since Its establishment in
1&34, when the congregation met for
worship in a small building at Fifth
and Jefferson streets. The pastor told
of the early struggle to keep up the
church, and spoke in glowing terms of
the organizers, only one of whom has
survived to witness the golden jubilee
celebration. This is Mrs. Mary Potter,
who is still a member of the church.
Ctfmmunion service and a reunion of
the "members followed the pastor's ad
dress, and immediately afterward one
of the prettiest features of the jubilee
celebration took place. This was the
graduation of a class from the primary,
department of the Sunday-school. The
exercises *were in charge of Mrs. John
G. Iloyt, superintendent of the primary
department, assisted by j Mrs. H. L.
Kemp, teacher of the boys* class, and
Miss Jennie Egli, teacher of the girls'
class. The exercises were held In the
large Sunday-school room, and included
short speeches by each of the gradu
ates, music, addresses by Mrs. Hoyt
and John M. Davis, superintendent of
the Sunday-school, and a short talk by
the pastor of the church. The exercises
concluded with the presentation of
diplomas to the graduates. .
The member* of the graduating class
are Chester Morton Freeman, Walter
1 l>ouis Woerner, Elmer Harvey Morrill.
George Bernard Adams, Margaret Fay
Downs, Anna. MacLafferty, Evelyn
Hope Vosbifrgh, .Irraa Viona Clark and
Marion Corinne Tambs.
The evening: service opened at 6:15
o'clock with a young people's rally,
conducted by Henry \V. Davis, director
of religious work at the Young Men's
Christian Associatipn of San Francisco.
The rally was followed at 7:30 by the
regular service, which was opened with
special music by the augmented choir.
! The features of the evening were ad

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, .MONDAY, DECEMBER 5. 1904:
POET'S SISTER
TO WED A STAR
Announcement of Engage
ment of Stephen French,
Actor, and Miss M. Sterling
* .OAcKtiAND, Dec. 4. â The engagement
of Miss Marion D. Sterling, the daugh
ter of Mrs. Mary H. Sterling and a sis
ter of George Sterling, the well-known
writer and poet of this city, and Ste
phen French, a widely known star of
the theatrical profession, has just been
announced. While no date has yet been
set for the wedding, it Is expected that
it will be about the middle of the com
ing year. The engagement was unex
pected save to the family only.
Mr. French, who last season was
leading man with Mrs. Langtry, first
met the young lady who is to be his.
wife more than a year ago. Several
months ago they became engaged, but
owing to uncertainty as to the date of
the wedding the engagement was not
made public at that time. Mr. French
came to Oakland two weeks ago a's the
guest of Frank C. Havens, uncle of
Miss Sterling, and as he intended to
spend the winter in this city arrange
ments were at once begun for an early
wedding. Mr. French secured a mar
riage license last Friday, and It was
intended that the ceremony should take
place during the coming week. At the
last moment unforeseen business mat
ters have interfered with* the arrange
ments, causing a postponement of the
wedding. He expects that if will be
necessary for him to leave Oakland
within a few days, and rather than
hurry away immediately after his mar
riage he decided to postpone the event.
When seen this evening at the Sterling
home at Piedmont Mr. French said:
"When I secured the marriage license
on Friday I. intended to be married
within a week, but business matters
which I did not foresee have made it
necessary for 'me to leave Oakland at
onceV and Miss Sterling and myself have
decided to, postpone the wedding until
my return. Just when that will be I do
not know definitely, but I think that
the wedding will take place during the
coming summer."

STAR BOARDER
TAKES POISON
Resents Insinuations That
He Might Have Been -the
Cause of a Domestic Tangle
WEBSTERS EN T UPKOAE
Wife's Blocked Attempt at
Suicide Is Followed by a
Scene With the Lodger
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 4.
Jealousy, pistoling and poison, two
attempts at self-destruction and the ac
cidental shooting of one of a trio of
participants in a domestic drama are
the incidents which kept the residence
'of P. K. Webster, 3840 Telegraph ave
nue, in a turmoil through last night.
Adam Baker, a painter, 24 years old,
added the third chapter to the book of
disturbance by drinking a 'large quan
tity of laudanum at the residence at 2
o'clock this morning, after 'he had be
come impressed with an idea that he
was the cause of the earlier quarrel be
tween Webster and his wife.
Baker selected the front porch of the
house as a setting for his attempt to
get off the earth. The husband had re
turned from the Receiving: Hospital,
where his superficial wound had been
treated. Mrs.' Webster was at home,
taking the rest cure after the exciting
episode, when she had threatened to
kill herself and had shot her husband.
The Websters had been haranguing
each other, making charges and counter
charges. Baker, a boarder at the house
for six weeks, learned that his name
was being passed around during the
discussion.
"If I am the cause of this I'll end It
all," he avowed, rushing to the front
porch and quaffing two stiff gulps from
a large bottle. Baker tried to drink it
all, but was prevented by Webster, who
knocked the bottle from his hands. But
Baker recovered the vial and soon aft
erward emptied it down his throat. lie
took enough to kill an elephant, and
that 'is what saved his life. He â  was
treated at" the Receiving Hospital.
Baker is a son of the late Special Po
liceman Baker of Oakland. The young
man, according to his somewhat inco
herent story, had trouble with relatives
at San Jose and came to this city. He
stopped at the Websters' place and was
much concerned about the domestic dif
ficulties that led Webster a month ago
to leave his wife. Last night the hus
band returned to make arrangements
to place his two children In an institu
tion. He upbraided Mrs. Webster, and
while the talk was heated she grabbed
a small pistol, declaring she would
shoot herself. While Webster struggled
with the N woman a cartridge was ex
ploded, the bullet causing a slight flesh
wound in Webster's leg.
Webster and his wife were Inter
viewed by: the. police, but the husband
refused to msi^e any \ charge against
her. They returned home together, only
to take part in* another scene a few
hours later. During the \evening the
couple talked about Baker. "You know
that you have no. rlghft to talk about
him," declared Mrs. Webster at the Re
ceiving Hospital. "He is the best friend
you've got."

PISTOL DUEL
ROUSES HOTEL
Clerk Murray of the Metro
pole Says He Was Shot by
a Burglar in the: Dark
FIRES BACK IN VAIN
Special Policeman Joins* the
Young Man, but Search
i Fails to Eeveal Intruder
OAKLAND, Dec. 4.â Barnes Murray,
19 years' old,, night clerk at the Hotel
Metropole, . Thirteenth and Jefferson
streets, was shot through the left arm
this morning shortly after 3 o'clock
while engaged In a pistol duel at the
hotel with what he supposed was a
burglar. Special Policeman William
SpragTie also took a hand in the shoot-
Ing, but beyond the. wound that Mur
ray received and the plugging with
.bullets -of , the residence of DrV M.
Muehlenbruch, 614 Thirteenth street,
no harm was done. Murray is as posi
tive that he was shot by a burglar as
the detectives are that in the excite
ment the young man accidentally
wounded himself. . >
The shooting occurred In an area at
the west Bide of the hotel and nine or
ten shots were fired before the clerk
and Sprague were through with the
engagement.^ Dr. Muehlenbruch,. who
was aroused, by the- fusillade, narrowly
escaped being hit himself. He threw
open a window overlooking the, court
yard and yelled for information.
"Ping!" a bullet crashed through the
side of the house, followed by two
more. 'The doctor's curiosity was then
satisfied.
A few minutes before the battle in
the darkness occurred Murray and
Sprague were in the hotel dining-room
eating a light lunch. The elerk heard
what he supposed was one of the
guests entering by a side door that
opens off an entrance from the court
on the west side of the hotel. Mur
ray went out to see what had caused
the disturbance and was surprised to
find the door wide open- He stepped
into the covered entrance way leading
to a stairway into the yard, when a
flash of flame and a report staggered
him. He felt a spasm of pain in his
left arm and a numbness.
With that Murray drew his pistol
and commenced firing toward a pile of
boxes in the yard, behind which he
supposed his assailant was entrenched.
Murray fired five shots, emptying his
pistol. He could not handle the
v/eapon to reload it until he had opened
the barrel catch with his teeth. Four
more cartridges were inserted. Mur
ray shot twice more and was re-en
forced by Sprague. Sprague could not
see anyone, but he fired two bullets.
Policemen hurried to the hotel in
response to calls and made a search
of the vicinity, but without success.
Murray was Insistent that hey had been
shot at and that the man who flred
was. so close that his coat sleeve was
burned where the bullet entered his
arm. ". The missile passed ' through the
upper part of the arm, inflicting a
painful, but not dangerous, wound.
Murray went to St. John's Hospital,
Thirteenth and â¢ Grove streets, for
treatment.
Detectives Kyte and Qulgley investi
gated to-day and reported that Mur
ray must have shot himself. They
found a bullet imbedded in the side of
the hallway where Murray stood that
is of the same caliber as the cart
ridges in the clerk's pistol.
Murray explained as follows:
As soon as I stepped into the hall I was shot.
I am sure of It, and I did not commence to fire
until I felt the wound in my arm. The detect
ives think I shit myself. But I am positive I
was shot by a burglar, or by some one who
was trying to set into the hotel.
Sprague told the detectives that the
clerk had been wounded before he got
to the door. The special policeman Is
positive he did not shoot Murray be
cause his pistol does not carry the
same size cartridges as that which
wounded the clerk. Murray came to
Oakland six months ago from London,
Ontario. He has been employed at
the hotel for three months.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 4.
Oakland Lodge No. 171, of Elks held
Its annual memorial services for de
parted brothers at the First Congre
gational Church this afternoon. Many
Elks from other cities were present, in
cluding the Rev. Charles L. Mlel of
Sacramento, who delivered the eulogy
for the departed.
The great church was filled with
members of the lodge and their friend3.
The lodge members gathered in the
Sunday-school room of the church, then
filed into the main auditorium and oc
cupied reserved seats. Every Elk wore
a little bunch of violets in his coat, pur
ple being the color of the order and the
mourning color as well.
.The music was a special feature of
the exercises and was under the direc
tion of Alexander T. Stewart, aided by
! Miss Virginie de Fremery as organist of
the great church organ, one of the finest
in the State, together with the full
choir of the church and soloists in the
persons of Mrs. Grace Davis Northrup,
Mrs. Carroll Nicholson,' Arthur Macur
da, Henry L. Perry and Thomas Va
lerga. James M. Shanley, exalted ruler
of the lodge, conducted the ceremonies.
Rev. William Carson Shaw, chaplain
of the lodge, delivered the opening
prayer and the closing benediction. The
original programme of the day was car
ried out owing to the unexpected recov
ery of the Rev. Charles L. Mlel of Sac
ramento, who had promised to deliver
the eulogy for the dead. Some days ago
Mr. Miel was announced to be too sick
to come to Oakland, and George W.
Frick, esteemed loyal knight of the
lodge, was substituted. Two eulogies
were delivered.
Fletcher A. Cutler of San Francisco
was the orator. He spoke first of the
beauties of real fraternity, and asserted
It as his belief that true fraternal bo
cieties such as the Elks were doing
much to bring humanity together and
to promote brotherly love and peace
with mankind. He told of the beauty of
the memorial day of the Elks and of
the exemplification of the motto of
charity by the Christmas dinner given
annually by Oakland Lodge.
Rev. Charles L. Mlel spoke of car
dinal principles of the orderâ brotherly
love, justice, charity and fidelityâ and
how by spreading these good was donÂ©
to the world. ".* 7'.
George W. Frick spoke more particu
larly of the dead of Oakland Lodge, all
of whom he had known Intimately, and
his graceful sentiments were app're^
elated by all.- â¢ -

CAUSES ROW IN SALOON BY
INTRODUCING LOADED DICE
I;. E. Moscly 13 Arrested and Charged
-With Assault With a Deadly
WeajXMi.
L. E. Mosely. colored, was arrest
ed last night on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon. He went into
a saloon at Laguna and Hayes street3
yesterday afternoon and began shak
ing dice with a crowd. Luck went
his way for a time, and he won every
thing in sight. The crowd got suspi
cious that something was wrong, and
some one threw out a pointer that
Mosely was shaking with loaded dice.
Mosely now was about $30 ahead of
the game. Some of the company ran
to the front door of the saloon and
locked it, demanding that Mosely
hand back his winnings. Mosely drew
his gun and threatened to shoot any
body who tried to interfere with hi*
leaving the saloon. The crowd scat
tered in all directions, and Mose!y
burst open the door and dashed down
the street. A noisy crowd followe '
him for six blocks, and he was finally
captured. After he was landed In Jail,
G. W. Frazier preferred the charge
against him. Later in the day he was
released on bail.

Th- steamship M. F. Plant, which Is
to run in the eo&stiasr trade between
Fjiti Francisco axid Coos Bar. "^as fully
cue yesterday, bat failed to put la an
appearance. Few vessels have sailed
under so many di~erent names. When j
fc-uilz in IS 79 she -was called the Cocoa.
Soon a^ter this her name was changed ;
to the Argmauta. Later on she was re- !
christened the Cuba. Notr she rejoices j
la the masculine title 11. F. Plant. How J
T-aT,y more names sha â¢will have before !
her existence ccr^es to aa end Is a j

The steamer Is now owned by Oood

Buckingham Palace we took it with
both hands last night at the Grand
Opera-house. Not a seat lacked Its
human upholstery and everybody was
there. Some spots looked like a chess
board, with black to win, for dark
town is very proud of its Williams and
Walker. Indeed, the audience was as
much fun as the piece. It was worth
the price just to hear the colored end
of us laugh, the gorgeous roll of it, the
rich, fat chuckle.
But we take our own word for Wil
liams and Walker. As Williams said, in
his strip of a speech last night, they
began here. It was not at the Grand
Opera-house. Nor was it at the ten,
twenty, thirties. It was in one of those
humbler excrescences of democratic art
where you cannot persuade those at
the receipt of customs to take l more
than ten. But all that is long ago.
Vaudeville has intervened, and the mu
sical concoction with which the come
dians took the town when they were
last here at the California. ~And now
comes "In Dahomey," incomparably In
advance of all these.
"In Dahomey" is a musical com
edy, written, eungr, staged and act
ed throughout by colored folk. J.
A. Shipp is the man of the book,
the lyrics are by Alex Rogers,
the music by William Marion Cook. In
plot the piece is as vague as the pro
ductions of -most of the blonde musical
comedy makers. Something about a
lost cat's eye in a silver casket, and of
a syndicate for enticing unwary stran
gers to Dahomey there is, but these
don't matter. . - -
They are simply setting for the
fascinating perambulations of Wil
liams and Walker, as a pessimistic
Sancho and a piratical Don Quixote,
respectively. The music again is notably
characteristic. One rather hoped the
piece would travel along in the fash
ion of the prologue, with its weird
jungle scene and movement. They tell
me the British Museum furnished the
text of the â well, what serves for
costumes, the throne of horns and the
rest of this scene. Will Marion Cook
has furnished it with excellent music,
and the dances, with the twinkling
cinnamon legs and swaying bodies, are
quite fascinating. The next scene is
In Boston and the third in Florida.
The costuming is quaint and sufficient,
except in the prologrue, when it i3
splendiferous. ""â ''
But one cannot but enjoy the com
pany from Williams and Walker
down. Your colored comedian is at
his happiest on the stage. Ke enjoys
every moment of it, loves to make you
laugh, and you can't help loving him
for loving to make you laugh. Multi

in "In Dahomey"? â and you get some
idea of the enjoyment the piece holds.
Shylock Homestead is Bert Williams
in the cast, always being swindled and
deceived .by his persuasive friend
Bareback Punkerton, George A.
Walker. Anything more deadly funny
than Williams here you won't see this
sido of Christmas, nor more amusing
than the fascinating scamp of Walker.
They have a duologue; Walker has
most of the talking, where Walker
pretends to talk to an invisible doc
tor about Shylocfc, who has an in
visible stab, that is what* used to be
called excruciatingr-
Only it is. But the song "I May Be
Crazy, but I Ain't No Fool," the joint
concoction of Mr./Shipp and Mr. Wil
liams, and sung by Williams to incred
ible encores, will be best remembered
of the fun. Walker, has a good one In
"De Minstrel Man," and anyway, it is a
privilege only to see the. Walker teeth
and bear the Walker laugh.

Don't miss Phyllis, which her other
name is Allen. -Phyllis sings, mostly
about "dear hearts" ana things. Still
she might do that and be even more
like the amiable calliope than she is.
It is Phyllis' dire determination to act
that Interests. When she sings "O

let you think that she is warbling
about "Any Rags." No, sir. She wrings
out her handkerchief and clutches her
ribs until every man in the audience
passes it up to the next. But the way
Phyllis wades in to the coquetry! She
hs.s all the delicate insinuation of a

doesn't, but the system of his silence
is not apparent. He neither holds his
tongue because she won't, nor because
he intends to trump her sulks; but
simply because the man that made the
play gave him nothing to say. Miss
Shaw, however, a highly accomplished
actress and charming comedienne, car
ried the thing through to a delicate
triumph. She depicted the unreason
able feminine in most subtle and
laughable fashion, and thoroughly won
her audience. Mr. Harold Cahill ren

THE NAVAL. WAY OF GETTING
AROUND A DIFFICULTY
Treasury Pays Expenses of Recruiting
Officers in a Peculiar
Fashion.
Officers of the navy who have charge
of the recruiting for that service have
devised a means of extracting money
from the Federal treasury. According
to a decision recently made by Comp
troller Tracewell It is unlawful to pay
the expenses incurred by officers de
tailed' for recruiting duty. He holds
that all they are entitled to receive is
their mileage, amounting to 8 cents for
each mile actually traveled. Mileage
will " not cover the expenses, because
most of the Journeys are short and the
stays. ina particularly city rather' long.
The planr is >to send officers around
Robin Hood's barn. "When it !s de
sired'that an officer shall open a re
cruiting office in Baltimore for a week
or ten days he is to be ordered to St.
Louis and then to Baltimore. His stay
in SL Louis is to be limited to about
five minutes. Then he is to- go on to
Baltimore. By the operation the of
ficer comes into possession of about
5160, out of which he has to pay about
$S0 for railroad fare. The remainder
will pay his expenses for a two weeks'
stay in Baltimore.
After he has "done" Baltimore Pitts
bur;:: may be his next stopping place.
-Instead cf going there from Baltimore
and getting about $24 he, under the
new plan, will journey to Denver and
return before beginning operations in
Pittsburg, and so on to the end of the
recruiting itinerary.
'It is believed that the Comptroller
will not dare question the discretion of
the . Secretary of the Navy to send an
officer wheresoever he thinks his ser
vices are required and that the scheme
will work. If it will not. then recruit
ing "ill have to come to an end until
Congress can act. That would be a
calamity, as the navy needs 1500 men
to man the ships in commission. 1 he
seaboard cities are not good recruiting
grounds, because there the satisfac
tory nien know too much about the life
of an enlisted man in the navy to be
persuaded to enlist, except as a last
resort or as a means of bracing- up.
As there is no way for an enlisted
man to get a commission so he can
become a' "gentleman." there is no
such incentive for an ambitious boy to
enlist ; in the navy as there is . in the
army.' where, after two years' service,

ALTERATIONS OCCURRING
IXOCR SOLAR STSTEM
Lend Scientists to Predict That Planeta
and Satellites Will Return
' to the Son-
The alterations now occurring: In the
distribution in the solar system have
led Professor George Darwin to pre
dict that the moon will ultimately re
turn to the earth, which gave her sud
den birth: so many ages before, and it
may further be prophesied that the
planets and their satellites must ulti
mately yield to the gravitational influ
ence of our dying sun and must re
turn to the bO3om of their parent. We
must conceive of the solar system of
to-day,' then, as gathered into one cen
tral mass, closely aggregated around
that point which, from the beginning,
has constituted its center of gravity.
And what will be the stage of this
shrunken object? It will be a. dark
star, a dead sun. There are myriads
such in the heavens. Sir Robert Ball
has said that. to count all the bright
stars that we can see and say, "These
are all there are," would be like count
ing the red hot horseshoes in England
and saying "This is the total number."
This dark to-be 'will therefore be Just
such another as millions more. There
will be no life upgn it. We cannot
conceive the terror of its cold, for the
nebula has been dissipating energy. In
the form of light and heat, into the
chilly depths of intersidereal space
ever since the first hour of Its long
aeval shrinkage.
What i3 the destiny of this dead sun,
among whose constituent atoms, re
member, will be those in the printer's
ink before your eyes and those in the
eyes themselves? Are they forever â
"stable in desolation," as Stevenson
has itâ to be borne onward through
infinite space? > No; thfa shriveled
globe, the common tomb of sun and
earth and Mars and of the bodies of
the great that once breathed thereon,
may live again. Give it but the con
suming' embrace of such another voy
age and in a moment a new, nebula
will be born. "The force of .their Im
pact will suffice to evaporate their
substance Into another cloud which
will repeat the history of old. The
p&th of the two dead suns will deter
mine the position of- the "principal
plane" which will form the ground
plan of the new system.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
JOIiy D. SPRECKELS.. â¢ ...Proprietor
ADDRESS ALL. COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN* McXATJGHT Manager
PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, SAN FRANCISCO
MONDAY DECEMBER 5, 1904
THE EXPANSION STILL GOES ON.
THE end of the year is at hand and the usual lull in trade ha?
not yet appeared. Instead, we have continued reports of busi
ness expanding everywhere. This is a most unusual condition
of affairs and speaks volumes for the present improvement in the
country's commerce.
Normally there are two periods of dullness every year â in mid
summer and at the close of the year. If there is np lull then busi
ness is abnormally active, and this seems to be the condition at
present.
All returns show remarkable activity all along the line. The
railroads cannot handle all the freight offered them, and their
earnings continue to increase over corresponding periods last year,
the gain in November being 7.1 per cent. The railroad stock list on
the New York Stock Exchange has responded to this improved
showing by steadily advancing until the shares have reached such a
point where in the estimation of man}* financial interests they arc
above the dividend point, and are therefore inflated. Other interests,
more optimistic, believe that the earnings will continue to increase
and the dividends will be expanded in divers ways and are back
ing their opinion by purchasing right along without hesitation.
These are the shouters of continued prosperity. They are fortified
by the large corn and cotton crops, which on their face do promise
another good year. The same condition prevails in the industrials,
though in a less degree. The iron and steel men laugh at all doubts
as to the genuineness of the improvement in their line and predict
continued expansion. One official of the Republic Steel and Iron
Company last week said flatly: "We could stop taking orders in all
departments and still run to full capacity till midsummer.*' Wall
street operators are equally sanguine of the permanence of the cur
rent improvement and give the bears a sorry time of it whenever
The bank clearings continue to affirm the better condition of
business. For several. months they have been showing steady gains
over corresponding periods in 1903, and the gains have lately been
remarkable. Last week they were 42.1 per cent, with thirteen of
the fifteen most important cities on the right side of the exhibit.
The gain at New York was 64.9 per cent; at Pittsburg, the center of
the iron and steel trade, 28.3 per cent; at the flour center, Minne
apolis, 15.5 per cent: at Boston, the cotton and footwear mill center,
19.7 per cent; at Chicago, the grain and provision center, 4.5 per
cent, and so on. The aggregate clearings themselves soared up to
$3,195,000,000. or 50 per cent over the normal aggregate of $2,000,
000.000. The failures of the week were 205, against 217 last year,
but it is noteworthy in this connection that there were several large
collapses, as was the case during the preceding week.
The clearings of San Francisco, as printed in The Call on Thurs
day, tell the story of trade in this city during the current year.- We
started out last January behind the corresponding month in 1903
and lost steadily until in Ma}- we were a long way behind the pre
ceding year in the volume of business. But in June the tide turned.
Our clearings then began to increase and since then have shown such
a steady gain over 1903 that at the end of November we had actually
overcome the continuous loss of the first half of the year and stood
S8,ooo,ooo ahead of 1903. As there was no undue speculation in
this city to run up the clearings, as in the case of New York, the
figures "are almost positive proof that all talk to the contrary not
withstanding we are. doing more business now^than during the same
time last year.
And whyjnot? -Our population has been growing with abnormal
rapidity during the last year, our crops are selling for high prices,
our real estate operations are very extensive, as attested by the large
number of new buildings going up all over town, our banks are
loaded with coin to such a degree that lately there has been a large
daily investment in good, interest-paying bonds on the Stock and
Bond Exchange for the sake of the interest, and our different mining
interests are in better condition than for a number of years. San
Francisco to-da}' is in full enjoyment of one of the most flourishing
eras of her existence, and there are no conditions in sight to indicate
any recession in the near future. For that matter, the same may be
said of trade all over the United States, which was never more pros
perous than it is to-day.
*"p HE State Board of Roads and Highways reports that there are
I 2223 miles of oiled roads in California. The board is of the
opinion that oiling can be so managed as finally to produce a
solid bitumen surface on country roads, that will answer all the
purposes served by bituminized streets in the cities. Observers of
oiled roads know that to do this requires methods of application that
will t2mp the road material thoroughly. The ability of bituminous
oils to combine with water seems to cause the roads to fail in wet
weather. The oil runs off with the water and leaves mud behind. It
should be possible, however, to make the tamping so solid that a
hard surface, shedding water, could be constructed.
To effect this is the purpose of the board. Its report on the
subject suggests the same attention to foundation that city streets
require. The bituminous rock, which is found only in California.
is a natural product. It was made by the crude oil flowing upon
ancient sand beaches or beds, just as it is now flowing out upon the
bottom sand of the ocean from Santa Barbara channel southward. It
tamped the sand soundly and formed the hard material as it is now
found. Applying oil to a road surface is an artificial substitute for
this natural process, and if properly done will secure the same re

The subject is of such interest as to justify all the care given
to it by the Board of Roads and Highways. In the first place, our
long dry season causes dusty roads that detract from the comfort of
those who use or live near them. The deep dust also increases the
pull in hauling loads over them, which is an economic loss. The
same power will haul twice the load over a good roadbed. We have
the crude oil in abundance already developed and vast reservoirs that
are untapped. Any additional economic use of this oil is a gain for
one of our heaviest mineral industries, and the State makes a double
gain, in good roads and a profit on one of its natural products. The
board will get much light upon the matter of proportion of oil to
sand by analysis of the bituminous rock which nature mixed exactly
right.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1904.
WOMAN'S BEAUTY AND MAN'S
POWER MAKE FIRST
IMPRESSIONS.
BY DOROTHY FENIMORE.
8OME one â I am not quite sure
who it wasâ had the courage to
declare that, though It is safe
to trust a dog who falls in love
with you at first sight, the same
is not true about man.
One cannot justly discount ths
power of first imnressions. They are
the best letters of introduction in our
social world. But how far one may
dare to trust first impressions in love
affairs is a different proposition. You
do not present your purse to a stranger
because you like his looks. Why
should any being- think of giving to
one whom he has never seen before
the best thing he posseyses â his heart,
and the life that [toes with it? Â«
Yet people are doing this every day.
Adults who could be safely trusted to
the uncertain mercies of a great and
unfamiliar city are always ready to be
taken in by a confidence tjame in love.
Of course, in love, as in other social
relations, the first impression is an
important element. Were it taken
away, there would be a loss of both
beauty and that mystery which is
the secret of fascination.
As a rule, it is beauty in a woman
v.hich attracts men. For this reason
some women are better calculated than
others to inspire love at first sight. No
MIRROR OF DAME FASHION
LITTLE buttonholed pastilles of the white soielaine are cleverly used to
supplement the trimming design in this Forsythe waist, the round
pieces being cut, edged with a featherbone piping cord and the but
tonholing worked over this in a brilliant burnt orange twist. These little
pastilles fashion the collar, being fagoted to bias bands, and they are used
very effectively, indeed, in the lace yoke and in medallions on the front of
the blouse. They appear likewise on the sleeve puff above the cuff, their
every appearance being as an insertion in the heavy relievo lace which
makes the trimming.
Facts About Food.
A company with a large capitaliza
tion was recently incorporated in New
York to manufacture and sell cornmeal
mush. It is problematic whether it
will ever become a staple of diet,
though Its cheapness would recom
mend it as such in a larpe citv where
the prices of food are usually hich.
The cheapness of cornmeal. however, is
not its only merit. Professor W. O. At
water, of Wesleyan > University, who
conducted numerous experiments in
foods for the United States Department
of Agriculture, has found that thÂ«
greatest nutritive value in any kind of
food of a specified value is found in
cornmeal. In 10 pounds of cornmeal
there is a trifle more than 8 oounds of
actual nutriment; in S 1-3 pounds of
wheat flour there are more than Q%
pounds of nutriment; in 5 pounds of

further description of Grecian Helen's
power over hearts is really necessary
after the lines:
And Helen came forth from her fragrant bower
Tlie fairest lady of immortal line,
Like morning; when the rosy dawn doth flower.
It is quite a different quality in a
man which swds an arrow through a
woman's fancy. It is power.
In "The Iceland Fisherman" Pierre
LÂ«oti uses this fact of feminine psych
ology with artistic effect in his ac
count of the meeting between the
heroine Gaud and the Iceland fisher
man^
"Although Gaud asked quite natural
ly the names of a number of others,
she did not 4jire ask his. That beauti
ful profile which she could just ses,
that proud and haughty glance, those
brilliant, quick eyes of his, with their
tawny gleam, had deeply impressed,
had almost frightened her."
This same susceptibility of the more
emotional sex tc power was worked
into the plot of one cf the most con
spicuous of recent novels, "The
Queen's Quair"
As Irving says, "Men are always
v.ooing goddesses and marrying mere
mortals." And when a masterful man
comes in sight maids had better look
the other way. What's the use of tak
ing chances on love at first sight.
Are Soldiers breat Smokers?
If recent statistics are to be relied
upon* the number of men âhleh placed
officers in both services who do not
smoke âwould bear out the theory that
smoking is going out of fashion in the
British.army and navy- It appears
that the majority of naval officers are
content, like the French and Russians,
with an occasional cigarette. Of course,
there are exceptions. The army has no
officer who.Is a more inveterate smoker
than the late General Gordon, who
was .miserable unless he had an ample
supply of cigarettes. Thus among the
non-smokers we find Lord Roberts.

ANTHONY'S
TEMPTATION
BY CHANGING POLLOCK.
1 1 HAT Is it?" inquired Stella Mat-
I I thew, stopping in the middle
I I of her dishwashing and "The
lAfVj Good Old Summer Time."
' * "What is it? A check?"
Anthony, who had come to be known
in publishing circles as "Stella Mat
thew's husband," did not answer at
once. His face turned a shade redder
and he crammed the envelope which
the postman had given him into the
recesses of his inside pocket. Stella
flung down the dlshrag and thrust her
self Into the doorway between the
kitchen and the combination dining
room and library. "Did you get a
check?" she persisted.
"Do I ever get checks?" Anthony
returned savagely, yet with a no(e in
his voice that inspired pity. " 'Re
turned with thanks. Rejection does not
necessarily imply lack of merit'; that's
the sort of/ thing they send me. I wish
I knew what it is they like about your
stories."
"Why, nothing specially, dear," re
plied his wife. She wiped her arms on
her apron that she might put them
about his neck without soiling his shirt.
"Fou write ever so much better than I,
only I've been at it longer. You mustn't
get discouraged. You'll strike it in
time."
"Time! I've been at it two years.
No, Stella, I guess it's a city desk an*
twenty-five a week for mine for the
rest of my life. What's the odds, any
way?"
In the face of such hopelessness as
this Stella felt her presence worse than
useless. She put up her rosy lips to
be kissed, and went back to continue
her struggle with the coffee cups. She
had seen Anthony "dpwn" very often
of late, and she had recognized in this
heartsickness* the one malady of which
she might not even try to cure him.
Her attempts, indeed, seemed- only to
irritate and annoy the big, square
chinned fellow whose defeat was so
rriuch the harder for him to bear be
cause of her success.
Anthony loved his wife, as a great
many every-day men still do, in spite
of the quips and jests of the comic
papers. He had thought her the dain
tiest and brightest of little women
when he married her, and his greatest
delight had come with the contempla
tion of the things he would do for her
when he "cot there." That he would
trmmately. "get there" he had never
doubted. The newspaper on which he
worked had printed three or four of
his romances, and scores of his friends
had complimented him on their clever
ness. Surely, the magazines ought not
to be difficult after this.
As a matter of fact, they had proved
not only difficult, but impregnable.
Manuscript after manuscript was re
turned to him, alwavs "with thanks"
and a printed slip. Stella, on the other
hand, had received five dollars for
her very first story, a fable intended
for children, and had sold nearly
everything that had come from her
pen since. This had not been so
humiliating, for Anthony naturally
looked upon fairy tales with some
contempt, but lately. Stella had found
a steadv market for humorous verse,
and humorous verse her husband con
sidered his forte. The fact that he
was fond of her and wanted her to be
proud of him made her progress mere
ly the more a reprpach. It was he who
must be proud of her now â he. An
thony Matthew, six feet one in his
stockings. Somehow, those six feet
were the crowning aggravation.
There was no denying that, notwith
standing his superior height, Anthony
did not write half as well as Stella.
His work lacked the grace and point
of her's, and he conceded it. A bur
lesque sonnet which she had finished
the night before lay on the desk be
side a long envelope addressed to the
"Editor of The Decade." Anthony had
read the verse twice, and he knew that
it was better than anything he had
ever done. The Decade would print
it and the boys at the office woulc
say: "Saw a poem of your wife's this
morning. I should think you'd go in
for magazine work some yourself, old
man."
Stella's fresh young voice made it
self heard above the clatter of plates
in the room adjoining. "The Good
Old Summer Time" had given way to
"Bedalla." Anthony paused, holding
the manuscript, to listen.
Oh. Bedalia. 'Dalia, 'Dalia.
I've made up my mind to stale ye:
Oh. Bcdalla. Bedalia. dear.
Mere association \>t words shot a sud
den impulse into his brain. The sonnet
was in his hand?, the addressed enve
lope was before him: why shouldn't thi3
contribution go to The Decade over his
signature? Its appearance as his com
position would be in the nature of a tri
umph, and Anthony felt that he had
earned a triumph of one kind or an
other. "I saw a poem of yours," they
would be compelled to remark at the
office. And Stella? Why. Stella could
gain nothing by the use of her name
with the verse â nothing but a few dol
lars, which he could easily, make up to
her In allowance. Anyhow, Stella was
his wife, and what belonged to her be
longed to him. If she knew what he
was going to do she wouldn't care. She
would be glad that he had found a way
to be happy.
Anthony seized thÂ© pen at his elbow

traced to a "Receipt Book" published
in England ia 1670. When used fig
uratively it means: '"Take a glass on

CASTLE GARDENâ R. D. W. f Va
caville, Cal. "Castle Garden," New
York, was originally a, fort which was
afterward transferred Into a summer
garden and from that it derives its
name.' It then became a place for
civic and military displays. In 1824,
when Lafayette revisited , America, he
was tendered a grand ball in Castle
and signed the poem in a firm, round
band. Then he folded the paper, placed
it in the enveloDe and sealed it. Stella
heard him open the door of the apart
ment and came out to ask where he
was going. "To mail your 'stuff* to The
Decade." he told her. "I'll be right
back."
: But he didn't come "right back."
"Why. Kiddie." she said,
"was it a check?"
Once the envelope had been dropped in
the box his guilt threw away its mask
and rose to face him. He realized as
suddenly as the temptation had come to
him that he was a thief. The paltry
excuses through which he had looked
at his act melted under the glaring eyes
of an accusing conscience, and he dared
not return to the tender gaze of his
wife. "Great heavens, what have I
done?" he asked himself as he stood at
the corner, and "What have I done?"
he kept repeating as the elevated hur
ried him along to his work.
All through the day new phases of his
plight persistently crowded into his
mind. "What if the editor of the Decade
recognized Stella's style in the sonnet
and wrote to ask questions? What if
he failed to keep her from seeeing the
especial number of the magazine In
which the poem was published? In
either of these events what would she
think of him? Would he lose her re
spect and her confidence altogether?
Anthony wiped the perspiration from
his brow at the thought. She might
even cease to love him. ;â¢"
It was a hard eight hours for the
city editor of the afternoon paper
which paid for the Matthews* liveli
hood. It was a harder evening: which
brought Stella's welcoming kisa and
her half-hurt inquiry.. "What took you
away so suddenly thig morning?" The
week that ensued was hardest of all.
He had become so morbid on the sub
ject of the sonnet that he was afraid
to take the one backward course that
suggested itself to him. that of writ
ing the editor that a mistake had been
made in the signature, lest that astute
gentleman should suspect the truth.
His eyes, formerly so frank and hon
est, rarely met those of his wife, who
soon discovered that something was
wrong.
On the Elevated station. one after
noon when he was going home An
thony saw the August number of ThF>
Decade. Only nine days had elapsed
since he had posted Stella's poem, yet
he looked through the magazine with
agonizing apprehension. % Suppose it
happened to have been used In that
issue? His hands were shaking when
he turned the last leaf and he felt a
hysterical longing to laugh or cry.
"This thing is playing the very devil
with me." he confessed to himself. "I
can't stand it much longer. I'm going
to tell Stella all about it."
He fullv Intended to do so when he
opened his door and saw the Jove and
solicitude in the face of the little wo
man who met him. "There's a letter
In the dining-room for you," she said.
"It's from The Decade. I didn't know
you sent them anything. You won't
let it make you blue, will you. dear?"
"No," said Anthony, shortly. He
strode into the dining-room and shut
the door behind him. It had come at
last. "What should he do with thf
money? Nothing in the world could
induce him to touch it. He wasn't
that kind of a thief.
A few minutes later Stella finally re
solved not to be angry at anything
Anthony did when he was so plainly
despondent, opened the door and
stared at him. "Why. Kiddie." sh*
said, "you look so happy. Was It a
check?"
"No," he replied exultantly, drop

had held in hia hand. "No: A re

FEWER ALIENS

Report Shows Falling Off
of Forty-Six Thousand Im
migrants During the Year
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â Immigration
to the United States decreased mate
rially during the last fiscal year, and
It Is a notable fact that the moral. In
tellectual and physical qualifications
of the immigrants admitted to this
country during the past year are high
er than ever before. These are two sa
lient features of the annual report of
Frank P. Sargent, Commissioner-Gen
eral of Immigration, which was made
public to-day.
During the past fiscal year 812,870
aliens arrived in the United States, of
whom 543,100 were males and 263,770 fe
males, an increase in females, as com
pared with last year, of 19.S70, and a
decrease ' in males of 64,046. Of the
total number 3,953 could read, but not
write, 168,903 could neither read nor
write, and it is presumed the remain
der, 640,014, could both read and write;
95,575 brought with them $50 or more
each and 501,530 brought each less than
$30. The total amount of money shown
to officers' by these 812,870 aliens was
$20,S94,883. or J4.776.S76 more than was
brought by the 857,046 arrivals of last
year.
At the various sea ports 8,994 aliens
were excluded during the year, 4,798
being paupers, 1,660 diseased, 35 con
victs and 1,501 contract laborers.
"It is interesting," says Sargent, "as
bearing on the attempts on the part of
contractors in this country to evade the
alien labor law to note that, despite
the diminution of immigration, there
was an increase of 415 in the number
rejected as alien contract laborers. This
is a much larger number than has ever
before been refused admission to the
United States in any one fiscal year."
Of the aggregate steerage immigra
tion 767,933 came from Europe, 26,186
from Asia and 18,751 from all other
countries. The greatest number, of
immigrants from one country, 193.236,
came from Italy, a decrease of 37,376
from last year; 145,141 from Russia,
46.3S0 from Germany, an Increase of
6294; 98.626 from England, an increase
of 12.407; 36,142 from Ireland., an in
crease of 832; 27,763 from Sweden, a
decrease of 18.265; 23.80S from Norway,
a decrease of 653; 11,343 from Greece, a
decrease of 2747, and 11,092 from Scot
land, an increase of 4949. Of the Ori
ental countries Japan furnished the
greatest number of immigrants, 14,264,
a decrease of 5780; while China supplied
4309, an Increase of 2100.
It Is noted In the report that more
than half of the total immigration, or
421.844, was supplied by the Italian,
Polish, Slavik and Magyar races.
Commissioner Sargent says that the
cause of violations and attempted vio
lations of the alien contract labor law
is the employer of such labor in this
country. To DUt an end to such of r
fenses It is necessary for the law to
reach such employers and by sufficient
punishment, more potent than the mere
expulsion or deportation of the aliens
induced by them to emigrate hither, to
deter them from such practices.
Concerning the persistence with which
some of the steamship companies bring
diseased aliens into the country, the
Commissioner says this feature "has
given the bureau more concern than
any other because of Its importance as
affecting the health, or even the life
possibly, J of citizens of this country
and because of the apparent determina
tion to bring aliens suffering with com
municable diseases upon the chance of
the latter being able to effect an en
trance. That the law Is being defied by
some of the companies is plain from the
fact that 1660 alien passengers thus af
flicted were refused admission during
the year."
Comparatively little difficulty has
been experienced during the year in the
enforcement of the Chinese exclusion
act, although about the usual number
of cases has been handled.
Commissioner Sargent says "that par
amount in importance, to all other legis
lation In regard to alien immigration
the bureau considers some adequate
measure for the distribution of aliens
who are admitted to this country."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, DECEMBER 5. 1904.
DO YOUR SHOPPING
FOR CHRISTMAS NOW
WOMEN ARE URGED BY
CONSUMERS' LEAGUE
MOVEMENT SHOULD BE UPHELD
BY JiAURA BRIDE POWERS.
Women of San Francisco who. have
hearts and heads In their make-up are
thus sensibly and forcibly addressed
by the 'Consumers' League: â¢
Do your Christmas shopping early. '
Don't leave it until the week before
Chrlstrras.
Don't ehcp after 5 o'clock.
Don't nhop on Christmas eve!
l->o this to v lighten tho labor of women and
children employed In thp stores.
So far so good.. But what's the mat
terter with complying with these ex
cellent precepts to lighten the .labors
of men, too? Aren't they included
among the bearers of burden amenable
to woe and weariness? Surely, the
Consumers' League didn't intend to
pass up the hundreds of faithful chaps
who serve us at the counters; but why
is it so many women are prone to prate
about women instead of about the.hu
man family, of men and women?
However, if the league's precepts
sink into the brain-cells of the Christ
mas shopper, and the lock is snapped
with the precepts within, the men will
benefit with the women and children.
This is unquestionably a splendid
movement â one of the best that women
have inaugurated since the establish
ment of the Juvenile Court and the
enforcement of the compulsory edu
cational law. i
Clubwomen, would it not be a
worthy demonstration of our united
intelligence to make this appeal a per
sonal issue? There are, 8000 clubwom
en in San Francisco. If those 8000
women adopted these good resolutions
what a splendid wedge it would be for
a permanent reform in the matter of
mad Christmas shopping!
Begin to-dav, madam â and you'll
make better bargains. There's a lure
to help you.
The following self-explanatory com
munication has been sent from the
Woman's Club of San Rafael, where at
last the people have awakened to the
civic crime to which thev are acces
soriesâthat of obliterating and permit
ting to be forgot the honorable history
In which San Rafael played a part:
Be it known that of all relics and landmarks
of early days in the history of San Rafael and
Marin County there is nothing left but seven
pear trees fJlanted by the mission fathers as
far back as 1S17, and these seven pear tree*
are now bearing fruit.
The description of the land upon which are
planted these trees is as follows: Lot of land
situated on the southeast corner of Fifth ave
nue and Lootens place in the city of San Ra
fael, and containing about a half acre, now the
pror>erty of Robert Colemau. the son of the late
William T. CCleman.
This piece of land with the pear trees should
be purchased and Improved and preserved to
the State and public as a memento of the early
days of California.
It is a fact well known that San RafaÂ«l has
no plaza or public square, or playground for the
children, and this half acre could be converted
Into recreation grounds for young people and
the public generally.
Now, here's a place for philanthropic
dollars. Are there no patriots or phil
anthropists in San Rafael who will
save these historic old trees that mark
one of the most pictuesque periods of
Western history?
And then, see what a commercial ad
vantage it would be to have these trees
preserved for "tourist use." Perhaps
the commercialism of the project may
help the cause.

a joyful family gathering, and all will
be merry as- a marriage-bell.
On Friday and Saturday -afternoons,
December 9 and 10, the California Club
will foregather at the Alhambra Thea
ter to witness a clever performance by

Peixotto's a warm welcome. They de
serve it. . .

The, Forum Club, Mrs. Frank Fred- [

smart function of last Wednesday. And \
well may the members .congratulate!
themselves upon their rationality In not!
inflicting a programme upon their de- [
fenseless guestsâ a thing devoutly to be
sued for elsewhere, not only in club- j
dom, but in society as well. It is the
only hope for the English tongue. The I
set programme has almost excluded
conversation from polite circlesâ fixed r
programmes and cards. Then let the
Forum's precedent, be writ in the book'
of good examples, ' and oft be quoted. !
The Forum presents the following in- :
teresting programme for the current
month:
Wednesday, December 7, 2 p. m.âCur
rent topic day, subject, "Chirography,
With Demonstrations." Leader. Mrs.
F. M. Wright.
Wednesday, December 14, 2:30 p. m.â
Lecture, "William Morris, Artist, Poet
and Socialist," Miss Anna Strunsky;
vocal selections, Amon C. Cain.
Wednesday, December 21, 2:30 p. m.
Current topic day/ debate, "Resolved.
That the so-called 'yellow peril' is a
myth." Leader, Mrs. F. M. Wright.
Wednesday, December 28, 8 to 11 p.
m.â Club jinks, given by the president!
After 10:30 p. m. gentlemen will be ad
mitted. 1
Now, that "Jinks" promises to be a
Jinksâ not a funeral, as some misguided
men are led to believe. If the men are
good they will be let in to take a peek
at a jinks of the feminine gender. Truth
to tell, I've never seen one, but the
Papyrus Club held one last year to
which the men were bidden, and loud
and long were the praises sung by the '
men- folk of this feast of song and 1
story. There was beer and skittles, Â»
frankfurters and pumpernickelâ just '
the kind men's jinks provide, a differ
ence perhaps arising in the quantity
rather than the type of refreshment.

" The subject of school gardens, as
well as flowers and lawns, for all pub

from the Outdoor Art League. The j

work in hand for. over two years and;
the members are gratified to know that
it has so broadened out .that other
cities of the country nre now being

The American Civic Association of
Philadelphia has advised the Outdoor
Art League that a national campaign
has been begun, I having for its object
not only the adornment of schoolyards,
but the * instruction r of school children
In caring for. the flowers and in gar

league earnestly hopes for. the co-oper

SANTA MARIA, Dec. 4.â A local oil
company has struck a gusher which is
the greatest in the history of the
State'sNoil fields. It is estimated that
15,000 barrels a day^ are flowing from
the well in four streams, each two feet
in width and one foot in depth. An 13
inch ' stream strikes the top of the
derrick with tremendous \ force, and
then breaks into spray, filling the air
for a quarter of a mile around.
A force of men is making dams to
confine the flow of oil. Four dams
have been made between the well and
the town of Orcutt. There are no
signs of the streams abating. The wVll
is on the Hartnell estate, west of
Brookshire.

Wealthy Californlans who saw it at
the exposition have made overtures
for the purchase of the figure, and the
club will sell if the offer is satisfac

FOR THE DAY
Popular Marksman Makes
220 Rings in the Medal
31 at eh at Schuetzen Park
Schuetzen Park was the mecca of
marksmen yesterday, and the light and
tvind brought about good results. Otto
â Bremer was high man among the
champions at the monthly medal shoot
with 220 rings to his credit. The score
was tied by W. F. Blasse of the first
class, who also made 220.
Much interest was taken In the final
Ehoct of the California Schuetten Club,
as many of the scores -were close and
it depended upon yesterday's result to
.determine the issue. Adolph Strecker,
the well-known shooting king, again
proved himself a victor by scoring 2247
rings in his yearly average. In the
second champion class Chris Meyer was
high with 2151. W. F. Blasse placed
21^6 to his credit in the first class and
was far ahead of all opponents. The
high man in the second class was M. F.
Hartter with 2134 rings. Louis Thier
bath in the fourth class made the ex
cellent total of 2015 and F. J. Povey in
â ihe fourth class made 1975 rings.
A challenge match took place be
tween the president, P. Jacoby, and
â cttretary of the California Schuetzen
Ciub, resulting in the president mak
ing a center at the pistol target and

SAYS RECORD
WAS HUGE JOB
3Ian Who Started Cresceus
on Famous Trial Accuses
the Officials of Fraud
WICHITA. Kans... Dec- 4.â What
purported to be a carbon copy of an
aflidavit sworn to by A. S. Jordan of
Lyons, Kans., created considerable of
a sensation among horsemen here when
it was shown to them.
In it the statement is made that
there was an agreement between af
fiant, who was starting judge and
timer when Cresceus was said to have
made his famous mark of 1:59% on the
Wichita track, October 19, 1903. and
George H. Ketcham, owner and driver
of the stallion, whereby the horse was
to be given a mark under two minutes,
regardless of the time made.
The alleged affidavit also sets out
that C. M. Irwin, president of the
Southern Kansas Fair and Carnival
Association, and Fred Stearns, one of
the timers, were made cognizant of the
scheme just before the trial was made
and that the former concurred in it,
while the latter remained silent.
Of Harry Eames, the other timer, af
fiant is made to state that , he knew
nothing, not even being aware that he
was in the stand or held a watch. The
original affidavit will be presented at
the hearing of the contest before the
board of appeals next week.
Both President Irwin and Timer
Stearns saw the "copy." Both imme
diately wrote to Secretary Knight
that any reference to them was false
and absolutely without -foundation.
Jordan is a horseman and starting
judge of considerable experience-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1904.
TIGERS START
BATTING BEE
Three Doubles, a Single and
Five Tallies Tell the Story
of Oscar Jones' Downfall
ANGELS TAKE THE LEAD
Jud Smith Lines Out First
Home Kim That Ever Hap
pened Inside the Field
The Tigers made their final mixup
with the Angels at Recreation Park
yesterday one to be remembered for a
while. At least Mr. Oscar Jones will
dream about it for some time to come.
The memorable incident happened In a
little battingr bee during the seventh
spasm and ended only after the Tigers
had become tired of walloping and five
of them imprinted their trademarks on
the welcome and far distant rubber.
Score â Tacoma 5, Los Angeles 2.
In no other round did the Tigers fig
ure as hitters. The avalanche of runs
became a reality after two were
knocked down and the third had es
caped by a hair's breadth. The Angels
never got jerry to Corbett enough to
warrant their making more than two
runs. One happened in the sixth, when
Jud Smith knocked out the only home
run ever hit inside Recreation Park.
Hogan was the first Tiger to face
Jcnes in the heart-rending seventh.and
a pass was his lot. Thomas flew out
and Doyle forced Hogan at second. It
looked gioomy enough, even if Shay
was hit by a pitched ball, but the atti
tude changed a bit when Doyle and
Shay Dulled off a double steal. Smith
should have nailed Doyle a foot cff
third, but got careless and let the run
ner squirm away.
Jones promptly tossed two strikes at
Sheehan. and Tommy punched the next
out along the third base line for a sin
gle and tied the score. Amid the roar
that followed Nordyke slapped a double
against the right field fence, and Shea
han's work was done. Then came Mc-
Laughlin with another, and Corbett
with still another, making it three
doubles and a single for the round and
five big tallies, that broke up the game.
Smith's home run, though a remark
able feat, was rather fluky, for Mc-
Laughlin had to dig the ball out of a
hole, and when he tried to toss it to
third it slipped out of his mitt. The wil
lowy third baseman kept tearing
around the sacks and reached the pan
easily. Joe Corbett was presented with
a beautiful umbrella by the Tacoma
players when he came to the bat in the
second inning,
The crowd was small, as rain had
set in shortly before the game was
called. The two teams will open a five
game series in Los Angeles on Wednes
day. The score:

PONIES IN A MATCH RACE
AT BURLINGAME.
MARIGOLD PROVES TO BE A FLYER
Sensational Polo Contest Is Won
By the Team Captained by Hobart
Hobart luck or Hobart judgment on
the quality of a horse show no dimi
nution as the years roll by. At Bur
lingame yesterday his pony, Marigold,
which he acquired recently, defeated
LÂ«awrence McCreery's Lucy Glitters In
decisive style. Later In the day Ho
bart played a sensational game of polo,
his team winning.
The race resulted in an easy victory
for Hobart's pony and brought the neat
sum of $3000 to the lucky winner, if
common report of the bet be true. The
race was run on the private track of
Francis J. Carolan at Crossways
Farm and was witnessed by a. large
crowd, including many society folk.
Professional jockeys rode and profes
sional officials presided over the affair,
so it had all the settings and circum
stances of a professional event.
The distance was three-eighths of a
mile and was covered by Marigold in
35 3-5 seconds. Marigold took the lead
at the start by half a length and fin
ished three lengths ahead without ap
parent effort. She was . ridden by
"Hand-riding" Kelly. Lucy Glitters
was a bad actor at the post. The llrst
thing she did was to throw her rider,
Dominlck, who.landedjm.his knees in
the mud. She continued to buck for
some minutes; The track was heavy
with sticky mud. The ponies carried
130 pounds each.
The event was the outcome of a race
between the two ponies about a month
ago, when Marigold won by a neck,
bringing $1100 to her owner. Mr. Mc-
Creery was not satisfied and chal
lenged Hobart for another race of
$3000 a side, which was promptly ac
cepted. The officials of the race were:
C. H. Pettingill of the Oakland track,
judge: Dick Dwyer, starter, and.
Charles Dunphy, timer.
The Whites won over the Reds on the
Eurlingame polo field during the aft
ernoon by the close score of 7 to 6.
For the first time this season Charles
W. Clark was in a match. Walter
Hobart also reappeared, after being
laid up for six weeks with a sprained
ankle. The sides lined up:
Whitesâ Charles Dunphy/y Walter
Hobart and R. M. Tobin.
Reds^-C. W. Clark, John Lawson and
Thomas A. Drlscoll. There has been
no such playing on Burllngame field
as was seen yesterday. Hobart and
Driscoll went after the ball as if in
a frenzy- Several of Hobart's . goals
were perfect sky-cleavers, on which
the ball soared far above the posts, but
was true to the goal line. He scored 4
for his side, R. M. Tobin 2 and Dunphy
1. Driscoll made 4 for the Reds, Law
son 2 and C. W. Clark 1. This being
off-side was not allowed. R. M. Tobin
distinguished himself by a goal made
at a difficult angle. Lawson made one
on a long-distance back-hand stroke.
The game was intensely exciting
throughout.
TURFMEN READY

Important Questions Will

Jockey Club Meets To-Day
CHICAGO, Dec. .4.â Turf leaders of
the West and South have been x heading
for Chicago during the past week to at
tend the annual meeting of the West
ern Jockey- Club, which is set for to
morrow noon. Delegations from New

other turf centers are in the city, and
local . track owners have , returned for
conferences before the final proposi
tions from different clubs are presented
to the stewards of the ruling body.
â¢^ The Chicago situation is conceded to
hold more , possible complications than
that of any : other: turf center. It is
thought the Worth Jockey Club will
ask for a slice of summer dates on the
supposition' that there will be no racing
at Washington Pask next year. The
opinion of several turf magnates is that
this request will not be granted.
â  Despite the fact that big delegations
are here to present: the claims of vari

Close Score of Two to One
The Oakland Hornets won their first
match of the present season for the
championship of the California Asso
ciation Football League at Idora Park,
Oakland, yesterday, defeating the Oc
cidental eleven, hitherto unbeaten, two
goals to 1. The game was a fast and
fierce one and was watched with great
interest by a good number of specta
tors.
The ball was kicked off at 2:45 and
in less than ten minutes the Occident
als iscored a goal. The Hornets were
unable to score in the first period,
which ended one goal to nothing in
favor of the Occidentals. After the re
sumption of play the Hornets equalized
the score and a little later McKenzie
scored a second goal. Wilson and Ap
pleby took the places of Podmore and
McArthur in {he Hornet team, Wilson
playing a strong game. The Disher
brothers and McKenzie, with R. Taylor
did excellent work. The referee was J.

INGLESIDE PARK GATES
ARE CLOSED INDEFINITELY
Demands of Greyhound Own
. ers Prove Too Exacting.
j> At the close of the meeting at Ingle
side Coursing Park yesterday Jerry
O'Shea, the managing owner,' an
nounced that the gates of the park
would be closed^ for an indefinite pe
riod. This is the result of a quiet but
bitter struggle between the park man
agement and the Greyhound Owners"
Association, which has been in progress
for several weeks.
According to the promoters the own
ers of dogs have been making unrea
sonable demands regarding prizes and
stakes, which could not be granted in
the present condition of the sport. Mr.
O'Shea offered to submit the matter to
arbitration and to produce the books of
the park to show there was no profit |
under present conditions. These over
tures were refused. It is claimed the
owners of the big kennels were satisfied
with the conditions, but the small own
ers precipitated the trouble.
The situation is a serious one for the
owners. There are more than a thou
sand greyhounds in this city, of which
300 are kept in regular training. "With
two parks in operation nearly 200 of
these ran each week. "With only one
park in operation from sixty-four to
ninety-six dogs can be run. As the
management can select the dogs, only
the best will be accepted. This will
render the slow dogs valueless.
Union Park will continue to run, and
as its officials have acted firmly in the
past they do not expect any clash with
the dog owners.
The class stake was won at Ingleslde
yesterday by Carlow Boy. which led
and beat Tillie R In the deciding course.
The surprise of the day was the defeat
of Full Moon, the 1 to 5 choice, by Sir
Winton.
The reserve stake was won by default
by the promising young Eastern dog
Lancashire Lad. Concord Boy, the run
ner-up, was withdrawn' because of se
vere trials. The day's results:

FIRE DAMAGES
LARGE FACTORY
Valuable .Vehicles Are De
stroyed at the Carriage Re
pository of O'Brien & Sons
SAVES CRIPPLED HOESE
Special Policeman Hooper
Kescues Helpless Animal
at Risk of His Own Life
- The carriage factory of O'Brien &
Sons at Golden Gate avenue and Polk
street was damaged by fire yesterday
morning. The loss will exceed $10,000.
A blaze in the basement spread over
that floor, climbed the elevator and
scorched valuable vehicles on the four
floors of the building. Flames spurted
from tbe^ windows and even from the
manholes in the sidewalks.
Tongues of flame nearly a hundred
feet high burst through the roof. The
roaring of .the -fire could be heard for
several blocks. St. Boniface Church,
across the street, was slightly scorched.
Immediately adjoining the carriage
factory is the veterinary hospital of E.
J. Creely. There the dramatic incident
of the fire was enacted. The place was
crowded with crippled horses which
were in danger of being burned to
death. : .^7
Special Officer "W. Hooper of the Pa
cific Humane Society, who lives just
across the street, hurried to the hospi
tal when ,he saw the blaze. At his
suggestion a hose was run into the
hospital, and willing hands assisted
most of the animals to safety.
HORSE'S CLOSE CALL.
IJut there was one horse that could
not be moved. He lay on the floor of
the stall close against the wall and
next to the burning carriage factory. A
puff of smoke blew through a crevice
in the wall. Hooper drew his revolver
prepared to send a bullet into the ani
mal's head if the flames became uncon
trollable. * J
Hooper stood at his post though the
flames were close to him. A steady
stream of water fought back the
flames. Hooper' waited with drawn re
volver until the danger was past. He
refused to leave the place until his
equine charge was safe in the street.
Large quantities of inflammable paints
and varnishes made the flre a hot one.
Six alarms were sent in and the quick
response of the Fire Department saved
adjoining buildings.
ORIGIN' NOT KNOWN.
The exact .cause of the fire is not
known. Shortly before it was discov
ered James Bruce, the engineer, was
cleaning a, boiler in the basement. He
and his assistant left the place to get
breakfast. When they returned the
building was ablaze. It is supposed
that a spark from the banked fires in
the engine room ignited some rubbish
and started the fire. - ; / y
The buggies and carriages on the
lower floor were run out into the street
by men and beys who lived in the
neighborhood, but those on the upper
floors were. all more or less damaged
by lire and water. The interior of the
building was badly scorched and
charred, but the outer shell, which is of
brick, is uninjured. The machinery on
the lower floor is believed to be ruined,
Joseph M."-i O'Brien, president, and
Jerome H. O'Brien, treasurer of , the
firm, were in Redwood City when the
place was burned. John J. O'Brien, the
secretary, declined to place any value
on the property until the other twu
members arrived. The loss is covered
by insurance.
The firm of O'Brien & Sons burned
out fifteen years ! 'ago and lost heavily.
Immediately afterward another factory
was built on the present site.
Charles Peddler, a man employed in
the building, came near being asphyxi
ated by smoke during the time the
place was on fire. He entered through
a rear window with the intention of
saving some harness. When rescued
he was found to be unconscious and
was sent to the Emergency Hospital.

At each side of the footlights were
clusters of palms and ferns, and in
front of the center 'of the stage was
a row of seats for the officers of the
lodge. *
Chopin's '."Funeral March" was the
opening number in the order of exer
cises. Paul . Steindorff and Edward

formed. It was followed by the sing-
Ing of "Not Dead, But Sleepeth" by

the Elks' Quartet, Messrs. J. , H.
O'Brien, W. M. Oglivie, R. B. Kay and
J. C- O'Donnell.
Responses by officers of the lodge
developed the sentiment of the opening
ode.
Great Ruler of tie universe.
All seelne and benign.
Look down upon and bless our work
And be all glory thine!
Oh. hear our prayer for our honored dead.
While bearing In our mind
The memories graven on each heart
For auld lass syne.
The invocation was delivered by the
Rev. J. A. Emery, who spoke in
a clear voice, full of emotion. The es
pecially selected musical numbers that
followed were: Soprano solo by Caro
Roma, organ recitation by C. S. Hoff
man, violin obligato, Herr Baumgar
ten; Elks* quartet and selection by the
orchestra.
Judge Henry A. Melvln of Oakland
delivered the oration. He said that
the glories of peace were greater than
Chose of war. * After war there always
follows a long and soothing calm. He
compared the war of the struggling
world with the peace of eternity, and
spoke feelingly of the dead brothers of
the order and of the eternal rest that
they have so righteously earned. The
great outpouring of San Francisco
Elks upon the memorable occasions of
their annual tribute to those who are
gone, but not forgotten, was repre
sentative of the unity of the order. --\-y
The speaker referred to the death of
former Grand Exalted Ruler Meade D.
Detweller and said "Not alone In
song, nor In speech, nor In story,
did he excel, but in the great
ness of his love for his fel
low man and in the goodness
of his deeds. As we think of
him, as we think of others who have
gone with him, we can Joy in the
knowledge, of how they toiled and
prayed to make the world better. When
\the heaven is filled with myriads of
splendid stars, In the calm of the night
we can read the message that God
flashes across interstella space and
know that all is well." >
Edwin Clark rendered a barytone
solo, "Peace," before a reading from
Tennyson's "In Memoriam" by George
P; Webster. The lines.
"Tin better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all.
Touched the soul chords. Miss Etta
O'Brien's clear, sweet contralto ren
dered faultlessly "Flee As a Bird."
Exalted Ruler John S. Partridge
â was brief but effective In hi#' eulogy.
He said that it was not to be^forgot
ten that when a brother Venters the
valley of the shadow of Death, and
the morning sun turns the hilltops, the
spirit awakes. Man's progress is but
a â¢ testimony to God's greatness, and
when in the midst of doubt and unbe
lief there is always that which broad
ens the way to a better being and a
faith.
.The speaker outlined the lives of
those whose names had been engraved
upon the tablets of memory of the
lodge during the year. He paid tribute
to each . and every oneâ John . O. Reis,
Paul Bunker. Charles J. Ellis. D. D.
Wass, Ralph Harron, George E.
