patch receired here from Batoum, in
the Government of KutalÂ», Trans-
eavcasta, reports the outbreak of m.
revolution there. It says that the
â¢treets vrere barricaded and that fierce
fighting- took place. The military em
ployed artillery and many persons, In
cluding subjects of the Ottoman empire,
were killed. *In response to a request
made by the Turkish Consul, the Porte

ST. PETERSBURG. Doc. 17.â A shud
der of horror has convulsed Russia. The
Government claims it has given battle
only to the "red" revolutionists, but the
populace generally believes that the
"white terror" has returned. Already
the leaders of the proletariat agitation,
\u25a0*ch/> e.=f.apÂ«KJ .rsLpture.on-. Saturday night
a.t the Economic Society, and even men
of the tank of Professor Milukoff are'ln
hiding from the police, who are bunting
them down.
The Government evidently expects a
battle royal and has made its disposi
tions accordingly. It fully understands
that the proletariat will give blow for
blow In answer to the wholesale arrests.
The Workmen's Council and the League
of Leagues last night issued a declara
tion of a general strike, to be begun im
mediately, and consequently, by an Im
perial ukase published this morning, all
Governors General, Governors and pre
fects throughout the empire, wno are cut
off by telegraph, are clothed with almost
dictatorial powers, being authorized,
without consulting St. Petersburg, to de
clare a state of elege and, if necessary,
even martial law. As most of the pro
vincial authorities are reactionary offi
cials of the old regime, the advantage
they will take of such power to terrorize
the populace can easily be imagined,
they being In a position to become petty
tyrants and wage war each In his own
particular fashion against the revolution
ists.
OXLY OXE XEIVSPAPER APPEARS.
The Novoe- Vremya was the only paper,
with the exception of the Official Mes
senger, to appear to-day and In the cen
ter of the first page is a half column of
blank paper, showing where the censor
had forbidden an article. The Novoe
Vremya seceded from the Publishers'
Union and was published under the pro
tection of the police and Cossacks.
The Slovo and the Novostl, two other
papers that have not suspended publi
cation, - were unable to appear, as the
printers walked out In obedience to an
order from the Council of Workmen, be
cause these papers refused to print the
manifesto of the proletariat organization.
In addition to the general strike it is
expected that the revolutionaries will
have recourse to the old methods of
fighting the Government. It Is stated
that terrorist organizations held a meet-
Ing In the Email hours of this morning.
Count de Witte's life Is considered to
be in danger and the annex of the palace,
where he Is residing. Is heavily guarded.
The most significant news comes from
Tfiarskoe-Selo, where. In view of the res
olution of the Government to put its foot
down* on the strike, a regular campaign
Is being conducted, with the purpose of
firing the loyalty of the guard regiments.
Each day a reriment from St. Peters
burg is reviewed and addressed by Em
peror Nicholas, and with much ceremony
his Majesty passes up" and down the lines
and f peaks personally to officers and
men. Grand Duke Nicholas is present at
these ceremonies.
On Saturday, after the review of the
Preobrajensky regiment Grand Duke
Nicholas and the " officers of the
regiment In turn on bended knees kissed
the Emperor's band, which called forth
an outburst of enthusiasm from the sol
d<ers. On Monday the Mailoveki regi

GOVEBXME3TT FIGHTING FOR LIFE.
The Government has chosen a desperate
mement to repress the proletariat, j It " Is
fighting for. its life in the Baltic region,
where. a revolt is admitted to be In full
fclast. with almost a practical certainty
that If it cannot be crushed its flames
will spread to -Poland. The -native popu
lation of the' ancient kingdom of, Lithua
nia is made up of a hardy and headstrong
people, who, having raised the banner of
revolt, will fight to the bitter end.
The Government to-day succeeded In re

it Is utterly unable to guarantee how long
It will be able to keep the cables In opera

Breach of Promise Suit
Against Packer
Causes Stir.

the Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG, Dec 17.â Another scandal
Is bubbling and boiling here, involving a
number of United States Steel Corpora
tion and Carnegie Steel Company offi
cials, as the result of Mrs. Mary I. Vet
ter's suit against Gibson D. Packer for
$100,000 for alleged breach of promise. Aa
is usual in all cases' of wealthy . men in
Allegheny County, the papers in the suit
are not in their proper place in the office
of records, and the county officials are
using their official positions to keep the
entire scandal from becoming, public.
Love letters, diamonds and magnificent
presents will form -part of the evidence
offered by the plaintiff.
The Vettcr vs. Packer suit threatens to
bring Into prominence one of the biggest
men interested in the United States Steel
Corporation, for It is this big man who Is
alleged to have introduced Mrs. Vetter,to
Packer eight years ago. This big . man
is now fuming- and fretting because Pack
er did not settle the case with Mrs. Vet
ter. and he is said to have scored Packer
roundly for being 1 mean enough to endan
ger:. his 'poittton-rf or ' the - sake - *of JIOO.OOO:
when he bad-aided Packer in making mil
lions of dollars. *\u25a0.-.,
- Packer was a protege of Andrew. Car
negie and one of his young partners. An
drew Carnegie made him a' millionaire.
When the United States Steel Corpora
tion bought out the Carnegie Steel Com
pany Packer was attached to the law de
partment of . the Carnegie Steel Com
pany. He seldom if ever appeared in the
local courts, and is unknown to the mem
bers of the Allegheny County bar. He is
said 'to have received a princely salary as
head of the Carnegie Steel Company le
gal department.
It Is a fact known in Pittsburg that no
where In this country does there exist
such a nest of scandals as among the set
to which Andrew Carnegie refers as his
"young men."
Mrs. Vetter arrived here yesterday and
has been Indisposed at her hotel. When
asked about her suit against Packer she
said: â¢.';.. "
"Yes, I <have brought suit against Mr.
Packer for $100,000 damages for breach 1 ; of
promise. He has treated me shamefully.
I have known him for eight years. I.be
came engaged to Mr. Packer two years
ago while in Philadelphia. He had been
paying me attention a long time before
that. â¢ Last February Mr. Packer broke
off the engagement without any apparent
reason, and he declined to marry me.
When he broke off Â«the engagement I
made a tour of Europe and on my return
lived In New York.; I am here to spend
the holidays and will return to New
York." V "': ._

LAWSON SAYS OIL
TRUST IS TOTTERING
Will Be Wrecked When the
Price of Copper Metal
Breaks.
Special Dtep&tch to The Call.
BOSTON. Dec. 17.â At the special re
quest of the London Daily Erpr&ss
Thomas F. Lawson has sent the fol
lowing cablegram:
"Why Is Standard Oil keeping up the
price of copper metal? A simple ques
tion to answer: Standard Oil is the
greatest public thief since man dropped
his tail. Secretly finding that the
metal was from natural causes going
to break to the lowest price ever and
for the same cause would remain there,
being loaded with $100,000,000 coppei
stocks, they Inaugurated a campaign to
get out.
"Owing to my public crucifixion of
the 'system* the public will not take
their stocks. Gamblers, pure and sim
ple, have taken some, but the people
will not touch them. Now I have them
where they cannot escape and ; their
crash will be awful.
"I have received additional offers of
fap'tfl should my $15.000,000' pool be
Insufficient. I would not quit for the
United Kingdom. I want the honor of
absolutely destroying the most hellish
band of robbers since Adam's day and
111 have that honor the day the world
knows that the price of copper is to be,
from legitimate causes, for all time
below 10 cents."

Mrs Kenney Tells
of Fight in the 4 :
Room.
Mrs.,J. W. Kenney, the woman- who

in the United- States Hotel iin a des

urday night was taken' to ttie- City

There is some ; chance that ahe may
recover from the effect* of the -terrible
fall. The husband, W. J. Kenney. a
private detective,' Is held on the detinue
book at the City Prison 'pending the
result of her 7 injuries.
The woman tells conflicting stories
of the cause of her. being hurled from
the window. In the morning she main
tained.that her husband had seized her
by the hair and arm and forced her
through the window. Later she told
Detective Bailey . that in a . struggle
with him she stumbled through the
window. As she fell she grasped the
window sill, she declared to the detec
tive, and clung there. In vain she. ap-
Sealed to her husband to save her from
ter terrible predicament.
"A woman like you ought to be lorn
to pieces." These are the words that
Kenney used, she declares. He left the
room and she clung desperately to the
sill for a while, then dropped. She re
members nothing more, she says, until
she recovered consciousness at â the
Central Emergency Hospital.
It seems a miracle that the woman
was not killed outright. In falling she
struck a tin roof not far from the
ground. No one had heard the desper
ate struggle in the room and she lay
there moaning for nearly half an hour.
She was taken to the Central Emer
gency Hospital; where it was found
that her Jaw was badly 'fractured and
that she was suffering from internal
injuries. Just how.bad the internal in
juries are is not yet known, .but last
reports from the City and County Hos
pital are that the woman has some
chances for recovery.. : .
Kenney refused to" make any state
ment to Captain Burnett .. yesterday.
He will not be charged until Mrs. Ken
ney's condition takes a decided change
for the better or worse.
The woman has been living In the
hotel under the name of Alice Selby.
She has been separated from her hus
band for about six months. The quar
rel which so nearly resulted fatally
waÃ caused by Kenney's attempt to
have her take him back. This she're
fused to do and he flew into a race.
The room was in darkness when the
man and woman engaged. in a struggle
like two Infuriated animals. No one
in the hotel heard the' disturbance,
though the woman declared that- he
hustled her about the room savagely.
She shrieked for help several times,
but none heard her. The police are
confident that whether or not Kenney
deliberately hurled the woman from
the window or she fell in trying to
evade him he knew she was lying
bruised and perhaps dead five stories
below, when he left the room. He will
be prosecuted. The prisoner stands
mute and sullen. . .

POLICY-HOLDERS
ASKED TO GUARD
President Paul Jlortpnj jof
"the Equitable Tells JTkem
to Watch New Legislation
NEW YORK, Dec 17.â An appeal to the
policy-holders In all the States of the
Union to lend their assistance'in'prevent
ing adverse legislation is made by Presi
dent Paul Morton of .the Equitable Life
Assurance Society in. a circular- letter
which being sent, to policy-holders.
President Morton says that the" insurance
business is certain to be Ithe | subject of
great consideration j by, Legislatures soon
to convene as a result of what has been
printed and said about insurance "during
the last six months. Thei circular con
tinues: v - ''\u25a0\u25a0:'\u25a0 ..\ â¢-'",: '\*' â¢"-
But you cannot give men character nor
make them honest by preamble, resolution " ; or
enactment.- What the. life' lnsurance 'business'
\u25a0needs above everything j Is ."honesty; and > good
business administration. There i can be .no ob
jection to proper legislation - safeguarding I the
business, but it should be souud' and sane. The
society depends - upon '.. its i policy-holders ' to - see
that there is no unreasonable''legislation'en
acted. It may from; time; to time call their
attention to , measures calculated to "do them
harm, but under no circumstances . will iit : be
party to any corrupt - methods " in * preventing
"strike" legislation. WÂ« aim to meet the Just
requirements of every State ! and Government
and rely ' upon our. policy-holders to . see that
no injustice Is done them. \u25a0. Any.unfair Insur
ance law or unfair Insurance tax measure en
acted ; By. your State ; Legislature Injures 'you
and reduces the -.: dividend "earnings of . your
policy. ; - Your dividends 'would Cbe nearly 10
per cent > larger if. It were; not" for th-Â» State
taxes and license fees that the society is
obliged to pay. â¢ : . .
Morton expresses the opinion that the
Equitable has no right; to' contribute to
political campaign funds, and informs the
policy-holders : that no ;such ; contributions
will be made by the society in the* future.*
He says in future the society's reserve will
be invested in; real. estate fxhortgagesfor.
the securities > of -other - well-established
corporations \u25a0 serving \u0084-'\u25a0 those .'; sections of
the country ] which . producethe \u25a0 premiums.:
":He assures 'the policy-holders i that, the
financial condition, of the; society, ;aa dis
closed ': by a < most careful examination by,
competent L - and disinterested ; accountants,'
is ; excellent, " ; and ; that C- many f economies
already .' in practiced and *: others \u25a0 yet ; to \be
made ., will enhance :.-â¢ its '\\ conditions. v He
urges I all policy : holders /to continue \ ihe>
payment, of ; their ."premiums; --and -says the

this; for them to have sound life insur-^

HEADGEAE BLOWS OFF
Polytechnic High School Boy
the Victim of an Accident
With a Peculiar Eesult
OAKLAND, Dec 17. â Charles Leon
ard, a student at the Polytechnic High
School, jumped off a car on the
Twelfth-street dam to save his hat last

evident fracture of - the vertebrae.
Leonard is suffering from a broken
back and minor abrasions and bruises.
It is one of tne most unusual things
in the history of accidents for a man
to have the vertebrae injured without
injury to the spinal cord."

PERFECTS NEW FIRE
ALARM REGISTER
Machine Is Invention of City
Machinist Dv Franc of
Oakland.
OAKLAND. Dec. 17. â A new fire
alarm register, of which John L. dv
Franc. the machinist of the Oakland
Fire Alarm and Police Telegraph De
partment, is the inventor and which
was manufactured in the municipal
shop, has recently been installed in the
quarters of engine No. 1 on Fifteenth
ctreet and since its installation has
given perfect satisfaction. The new
register is of the pattern known as the
punch machine and does away entire
ly with the ink pad and marker.
The points of superiority claimed for
the new register over the old style are
its simplicity and absolute accuracy of
record. The Dv Franc register Is es
pecially notable in respect to lack of
complicated mechanism, as it contains
less than half as many parts as the
old punch registers. It is also ex
tremely easy of access when repairs
are necessary. Its only point of sim
ilarity to the old machine is in the use
of a spring: to control the tape. Dv
Franc is now at work on a tape reg
ister, "in which the use of the spring
will be entirely replaced by electrical
energy, the machine being operated by
ths current of the alarm system.

YOUNG BOY
SHOT DEAD
BY OWN GUN
BOY WHO WAS KILLED BY ACCI
DENTAL DISCHARGE OF GUN
WHILE HUNTING. I
Ernest Johnson Is
Killed While
Hunting.
BERKELEY. Dec 17. â Death in
tragic form came to Ernest Johnson
this afternoon during an excursion on
the bay, in which duck hunting: was
expected to provide an hour of rare
sport. Johnson, a lad of IB years, was
shot through the waist by the' acci
dental discharge of his own gun. He
died within a ahort time afterward.
He was removed by his companions to
the Roosevelt Hospital, but did not
show signs of life while being carried
to the sanitarium, and Dr. Benton pro
nounced him dead.
Johnson's gun was discharged as the
lad trailed it after him while he was
attempting to climb from a tiny sail
boat to a rowboat which, the youth had
attached to the larger craft. The shot
entered his body at the waist. He did
not speak or move after 'the accident.
Charles Hansen a companion of the
wounded boy. retained his nerve un
der the trying circumstances and as
quickly as possible brought the craft
in which the lads were afloat to shore.
Ernest Johnson's parents at 933 Bristol
street in West Berkeley were notified
and the ambulance of the Roosevelt
Hospital was procured. . '
The boys were in the vicinity of
Sheep Island when the accident hap
pened. They had planned an afternoon
of sport, each being armed with shot
guns and an abundance of ammuni
tion. They were expert at sailing their
craft and were accustomed to the uso
of firearms, despite the fact that
neither was more than 16 years old.
The dead boy was a son of Andrew
Johnson, an employe of the Southern
Pacific Company, holding a position on
the ferry-boat Oakland. The youth
was an expert musician, a bright
schoolboy and .highly esteemed by the
community In which his people resided
for his manly ways and excellent hab
its. â¢ -. . ... -
This Is the second accident in which
the careless handling of a gun <by
youthful duck hunters of West Berke
ley has resulted disastrously. Two
weeks ago Charles Salisbury trailed
his shotgun after him while leaving his
rowboat to climb up on the wharf at
West Berkeley. He received the con
tents of the gun barrel in his right
leg. shattering the limb so that am
putation was necessary, death beinjj
narrowly avoided. Salisbury is now at
the Roosevelt Hospital and stood on
crutches on the. porch of .the hospital
this afternoon watching the body ; of
Ernest Johnson being brought Into tho
place, wiping a tear from the eye as
he remarked, "Poor Ernest. , He was a
little friend of mine and a fine lad." =

OAKLAND, -Dec. 17.â Within less than
three hours of the, time that W. H. Jones,,
a towerman. employed by the Southern
Pacific Company, was / held 'yp at Fifth
and Pine streets early this morning: John
Mitchell and John Hedigen were arrested
on suspicion of having committed "the
robbery.;^ * This afternoon , Mitchell was
positively identified by Jones as one ot
the footpads. : The pair were taken into
custody at Seventh and Pine streets by.
Patrolman^ McKeegan,; whose- 'attention
was attracted to them; by their suspicious
conduct . \u25a0 \u25a0
Jonea was on duty at the first. tower on
the Oakland mole last night, and after
being relieved took the last train tOrWest
Oakland and started for; his. home at 1705
Fifth street/ At the corner of Fifth and
Pine streets, where it is dark, he was sud
denly confronted by two men,; the pro
verbial "tall and shoremen," and ordered
to throw up his hands. He resisted and
was choked. into submission by the taller.
The" highwaymen searched the pockets
of their victim, : securing $29, and after
telling him to move on and riot look back
made offin. the darkness. ;
Jones reported the hold-up to the police
and orders were at once sent out by Cap
tain W. J. â¢ Petersen , to all the officers in
the. city to arrest any one answering the
description given by Jones of the foot
pads. Jones was held up at 12:30 o;clock,
and at ' 3 1 o'clock Officer McKeegan >- no
ticed two men answering: the description
of\ the highwaymen standing in the shad
ow | at '-\u25a0 the:.- corner ,of Seventh and Pine
streets. As they were unable to furnish a
satisfactory reason for their presence
there at that hour McKeegan \u0084-; placed
them under arrest and their names were
entered on the detinue book at the; police
station. â¢ .
' Jones called . at the station this after
noon and at once; identified Mitchell, as
the tall \ man of the pair who had ' held
him up. He was unable to say whether
Hedigen was the second of- the robbers,
as he. had 'been unable to get a good look
at the short man while the pair were en
gaged in searching him.
Detectives Kyte and Quigley were de
tailed on the case and this -â¢â¢ afternoon
they "sweated" both prisoners' for some
time.- Whatever information was gained
. from \ the men under arrest was kept se
cret by: the officers,' who refused to give
out any information except that; the men

Handsome Illustrated Pam
phlet Issued by Members of

OAKLAND, Dec. 17.â Contrary to the
expectations of : Oakland and Alameda
â¢ County, real estate dealers, the busi
j ness of the present month has consid
erably exceeded that of the correspond
[ Ing period; last year, and if existing
t conditions in the market continue until
I the close of the year, the business of
j. 1904, . which , was a record breaker in
I the Alameda County real estate market.
| will have been beaten, both in 'the
i number of sales and the value of prop-
J erty involved. Many dealers report
' that so far they have done more busi
j ness in the last sixteen days than dur- '
; ing the - same, length of time in any ,
1 previous month in the present year, j
I Especially notable has been the sale. :
lately, of small residence properties on
the Installment. plan, the lots being
purchased^ by .newcomers to Oakland,
i who have determined to build homes
of their own and make this city their
permanent place 'of residence. For the
most part these people are from the
[Eastern and Middle Western States.
' and â¢ have been brought to Alameda
County by the advertising of real es
tate cc i and the Oakland Board of
Trade. '\u25a0-. - ' .
In addition .to, this large sale of resi
dence property, there has of late been
a constant Inquiry for business prop
erty of all description, and one of .the
largest sales of this class recently re
ported, was that of a lot and building
on the corner of San Pablo avenue and
Nineteenth street by J. J. Hanlfln to
Dr. Frank L. Adams. This property
was sold through the J. H..MacD6nald
Company, and Mr. Mac Donald also re
ports-fourteen other eales of property
in the last week.

PIIICES ADVANCING..
Berkeley real estate men are also re
ceiving -their full ; share of the general
prosperity, and many sales are reported
in all narts of that city. A member of
the Mason-McDuffle Company said to
day: ,
While the higher priced property nearer the
university Is much sought after, the greatest
number of sales are . reported In the south
eastern section of the city. This _ to un
doubtedly due to the proposed extension of the
Key Route up Claremont avenue to the sltÂ«
of the new Tourist Hotel. ' The tracu most
affected by this work^will bÂ« -Co by. Fair
view Berry-Baags and Claremont. In the lat
ter residence park the Mason-McDuf fle Com
pany has made fourteen salts during the last
ten days. ' \u25a0 \u25a0 . \u25a0 :.. . -
An examination of the records shows that at
l^ast thirty resales have b*Â«rn \u25a0 made In the
Berry-Bangs Tract daring the past month at
prices ranging from $1550 to $2000 per lot.
This property \u25a0 was placed on the market about
two years ago at $10CO per lot. The company
itself disposed of Its holding In a very short
time and all . of* the recent sales . have been
made by those who were fortunate enough ti*
buy at the first prices. .
The movement - continues southward ana
Falrvlew Park Is th* next tract to be affected
by this demand. This beautifully and highly
improved piece of residence property was
opened on October 15 last, at $900 a lot. Up
to date 180 lots have been sold and six sub
stantial residences have already, been built.
The lotÂ« flrst offered at $900 are now bring
ing an average of $1200 each and the prices
ari constantly rising.. .Within six month, it Is
expected that the lots will be considered a
ba^ n of at the 15 Fl'n C^w Park block, were held
back by the company and lots inthem are now
belnÃ offered ' at $000 and $1000 each. The
Mason-McDuffle 'Company, who ar* agents
for the owners, report, that ; they arÂ« being
snapped up very rapidly at : the , latter prices.

Alameda Trustee Gives Idea

formation Before Decid
ing on the Application
ALAMEDA, Dec 17.â The City Trustees
expect H."M. Ferguson will file an appli
cation to-morrow night for â¢ a railroad
franchise. Over what streets he will seek
the privilege is not known and for whom
he is acting Is likewise a matter of mys
tery. Ferguson said at the meeting of
the City Trustees on December 4. when
W. J. Morgan of San Francisco, through
W. H. H. Hart, applied for a railroad
franchise on Santa Clara avenue, that he.
Ferguson. Intended to make application
for a franchise to-morrow night.
Cfty Trustee J. F. Forderer says he is
willing to listen to any person or corpor
ation wanting a railroad franchise in
Alameda, but they must prove to his sat
isfaction that they are not seeking the
privileges for. speculative purposes and
that thev< are financially able to put
through their project. Forderer . favors
caution in the proceedings, and if there
are to bÂ« competitors for the franchise
he believes that It should be offered for
sale.
City Trustee W. M. Bowers does not
hold the same opinion as General Hart,
that two railroads could use the same
tracks on. Santa Clara avenue, and ho
also saya that there will be unusual ob
jection to the granting of any franchise
on Santa Clara avenue that would permit
the running of freight trains on . that
thoroughfare. Hart said If Morgan was
granted the franchise he would want per
mission to operate freight trains on Santa
Clara avenue during certain hours.

Storms.
. The Pacific Mall Steamship Company's
steamer Korea arrived In port yesterday
morning at 11 o'clock. She was off the bar
at 7:20, but the fog was so dense that
Captain Seabury deemed It best to lay to
ft while before attempting to cross In. At
f :SO, when about a mile outside the Gold
en Gate, he came to anchor and stayed
there until shortly before U, when the
teg lifted and she crossed In.
Ehe at once steamed up the bay so soon
v the Quarantine officers had examined
ber passengers, and was tied up at her
'dock before 2 o'clock. Captain SÂ«abury
brought hÂ«r up to the wharf with the
\u2666ase that a ferry-boat is landed alongside
* ferry slip, ir.akir.g- one of the finest
landings that has been seen in this port
for many a day. She brings a big cargo
and many passengers.
Rough weather was â¢ncountered for
several days before the Korea reached
Honolulu, and the usually steady boat
\u2666â¢as pitched about to a considerable ex
tent. From Honolulu up the weather was
food.
Among the passengers were General
Â»nd Mrs. Samuel S. Sumner, Captain
and Mrs. E. P. Jewey Jr. and Major L*o
Feblger. General Sumser has been oft a
tour of l&saection to the post at Hono
lulu. He found the pest there to be in
first-class condition. General Sumner
states that the new post which is now
under construction will be completed
early in August and when finished will
be one of the most desirable set of Quar
ters occupied by any of Uncle Sam's sol
diers.
Commander A. Nebolsine of the Russian
pavy is on. bis way to Washington, whÂ«rÂ«
be Is to bÂ« naval attache. N'ebolslne was
commander of the Russian warship Au
rora, which put Into Manila during- the
war, having on board fifteen men killed
In battle and eighty wounded. Neither
the veesel nor the commanding officer
were injured.
Lieutenant W. Kartarzoff of the Rus-';
sian navy Is en route to St. Petersburg.
This young officer was on the Russian
cruiser Swatlana when she was sunk in
the Straits of Sushima. He grabbed a
life-preserver and leaped overboard,
where he floated around in the sea for
clx hours until he was picked up by the
steamship America Maru. He was then
taken to Yokohama, where he remained
a prisoner of war for six months. He
cays he was well treated during the time.
Willis E. Gray, who has been for four
years the manager of the construction of
the Canton and Hankow Railway, has
severed his connection with that road,
and is returning home to remain in Amer
ica. He says the American interests in
that road have been disposed of and that
now. it is practically in the hands of Eng
lish -capitalists.
H. H. Long is returning from a four
years' residence In the Philippines, where
l.i. :.<u< Ue:i at Placer, Mindanao, teach

very anxious to learn and are making
gTeat progress. They take a tremendous
Interest In baseball and some of them
have become expert players. They have
tried football, but the climate Is not suit

Encounters Terrible Stormn.
Th* French bark' Admiral Oourbet arrived
In late last nlgnt. She had a terrible passage
en the way to this port. In trying to round
the horn she ran Into a succession of terriflc
hurricanes, which tossed her about like a
cocktl shell. At times ehe waÂ» entirely at
the mercy of the elements. Tremendous seas
ewept the vessel from stern to stern. The
weather was bitter cold and for days the chip
tras In the midst of blinding enow storms,
\u25a0while great icicles hung down from the rig
ring. One great mountainous pea struck' the
â¢btp and smashed in two plates on her port
elde," Â«t the came time carrying away her
royal yard. The great ; force ;of the volume
of water that crashed upon her decks caused
her to tremble like an aspen teaf. and for
a time Oantain Charrier thought the vessel
\u25a0wav doomed. The vessel finally got around
the horn and then it was discovered that the
provisions were growing short. Rations were
reduced. Fortunately for all on board Just as
the last amount of grub had been consumed
the echoon<Â»r Klikltat hove in eight, and sup
plied the Oourbet with enough potatoes, and
flour to help them out. and kef'P them from

Cardiff. She Is consigned to G. W. McJCear.

burn, Captain H. N. Burgess, was yester
day discovered by â¢ Chief ": Customs | In
epector Loftua ;and Inspector "Whaley.
The customs officers went to j Eagle ; Har
bor, . where the" Coburn. ; now.' lies, % and
found almost 800 sacks of coal stacked up
ready for. l sale. Borne of ,-,the^, coal?- had
been sold to Hall Brothers' Shipyard- and
more was being takentout of the Bhlp.v *
Coal was not specified on the 'manifest
of- the vessel, | which | showed I that;' she
came over from" Honolulu in ballast.'; The
captain explains the matter by saying he
had ordered the stevedores, to leave a
small amount of . coal - in ;. the hold, but
they left more than -he'; wanted^ The fact
that the coal is from Australia and/ not
specified on (he manifest makes it practi
cally a case of smuggling/ so* the cargo is
being held by the customs officers.,: The
matter will be reported . to-morrow to
Collector Ide. :.
It Is expected that Burgess will be given
an official hearing. â The Coburh Is
owned in San /Francisco..-

NO WINTER LULL THUS FAR.
IT really seems as if this remarkable era of prosperity never would
come to' an end. It is now the middle of December, 'when trade
is usually at its lowest ebb, but from all sections of the country
come reports of a holiday trade which is surpassing all previous rec
ords/of mills fully employed everywhere, and of a spring demand
above all anticipations. If this condition continues there will, be no
winter lujl at all.
The country seems to have a surplus.of money, with everybody
doing his best' to spend it in some form or another. In spite of the
frowns and restraints of many powerful financial interests, the pub
lic appear to . have finally caught the speculative fever, and have
been trading in Wall street with a freedom bordering upon reckless
ness. The daily sales' on the New York Stock Exchange for a week
or ten days have ranged from 1,000,000 to 1,800,000 shares per. day,
and on one or two days were even larger. Fluctuations of three or
four points per day have not been unsual, and some' stocks have
advanced from $5 to $10 in one session. The bull .campaign, for
which the great banks have been saying the market is not yet pre
pared, is apparently on in full force. How long it will last and what
conditions it will result in remain to be seen.
The money market was perceptibly easier last week. Rates for
call loans in New York were oh a lower plane, and there was no
especial stringency. The movement of funds from the interior to
New York was heavy, resulting in a net gain of about $5,000,000,
after deducting several losses, such as absorptions by the Sub-
Treasury, etc. On Friday payment was begun on the anticipated
Government bond interest falling* due in January. This amounts
to about $4,200,000, but not more than $3,000,000 will find its way
into the money market. On the same day the Standard Oil dividend
of $10, amounting to $10,000,000, was also payable.; so, taking the
situation as a whole, *Jiere is plenty of money floating about in one
direction or another. It is a characteristic of the current era of pros
perity that when a large amount of cash money is needed it suddenly
appears in the nick of time, like the hero in the play, and relieves the?
situation. Nobody can complain of this characteristic.
The usual weekly statistics, from which commercial experts draw
their conclusions as to the state of trade, continued to make a most
excellent exhibit last week. The railroad earnings made their usual
gains, the failures were 239, against 286 last year, the exports from
New York were $3,424,000 larger and the imports $1,496,000 smaller
than for the corresponding week in 1 904, while the bank clearings
exhibited a gain of Z-7 P er cent Â» w * tn aggregate clearings of the vast
amount of $3,294,500,000, and all the important cities, except Cin
cinnati and St. Joseph, in the column of gains. - This is expansion
on a very large scale for a month when business is supposed to be
dull, with everybody taking stock.
The staples continue in good condition for sellers as a rule,
though this is the season of the year when the manufacturer and
wholesaler usually retire into the background and the retailer is the
principal figure in the trade field. Wool, hides, leather, provisions,
grain, dairy products, cotton, lumber, metals, etc., are. in good
average movement, with a steady rise in copper, which has caused
excited speculation in the copper stocks; and a demand for cotton,
which has made business very lively on the Cotton Exchange. The
crop returns are of the very best, and the farmers all over the United
States are enjoying continued prosperity. It is this condition, above
all others, which gives us the commercial boom (for it is nothing
else) of to-day. The harvests of 1905 have been first class- both as
to quantity and price, and the prospects for 1906 are thus far bril
liant. We are in need of more rain on the ''â¢Pacific Coast, for the
scattering showers we -have thus far received have not yet given
the soil "a good wetting, except in the southern part of "tlie. State,
but there is still plenty of time for an abundant rainfall. . No especial
anxiety has yet been expressed, but the weather is daily becoifiirig
more of a factor in the situation, and in some quarters there; is a
perceptible disposition to proceed with caution until the outlook for'
the coming crop season becomes more defined. .With merely'aver
age crops next year the State will enjoy continued trade activity,
for stocks of 1905 prodvets are already closely cleaned up, and excel
lent prices for^he 1906 harvest are even how almost assured/
CORPORATION CONTROL.
FEUDAL conditions is the way Judge Peter S^ Grosscup of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals expresses the. social
state toward which we are progressing because of our lack of
control of corporations : "conditions under which to him Who ' had
more was added, and from him who had. not was taken even the
little that he had." The Judge has written a 'paper for the
can Illustrated Magazine entitled "Who Shall Own America? â The
Control of Corporations â A Problem and Its Solution."' "ln, this the
Judge proposes a scheme which he calls the "peopleization of cor
porations," meaning by that their actual control -by stockholders
under some such supervision by, the United States Government as
it exercises over tKe national banks. He takes, the side of indi
vidualism against socialism, and one intent of* his plan is to en
courage labor to become a sharer in ownership:.
The first item of his solution is to establish national incorporation.
Second, he would insist on corporations being constructed on lines
of simplicity. . Now they are. so complicated that the. small investors
arp^afraid of being bunkoed by the involved, system of securities,, and
consequently they put their money by preference in the savings
banks; and so instead of the laborers and, the savers of small sums
obtaining . a just dividend out of the great hew things of the day,
their funds have gone into "the great modern fiscal funnel, from
which^the men of might, who have ; controlled the outlet, have ob
tained their power." These men are the ones who will become the
equivalents of the old feudal barons, who virtually owned the earth
and made serfs of the workers.
Judge Grosscup points out the immense growth of modern
corporate power. At least, two of them control vaster funds each
* year than does, the United States .Government ; and corporate trans
actions are perhaps nine to one "of all other business. 1 He says that
* this putting, of new created wealth in corporate .form, is the new'
great fact" of our time. He seeks not to destroy this, jÃut to place
the people in control of ; the^dornain; of corporate wealth..

AT ANNUAL FEAST.
Thawing-Out Process Is Necessary for
Women's Sane Development.
Judge Frank Murasky Will Talk fo-Mor
row'Upon "Child and State."
LAURA BRIDES POWERS
A sane distribution of work and playâ
that's -what the California Club stands
for.
Of course, there are some serious-mind
ed ladlesâ dear, good soulsâ to whom life
is a cited serious proposition and who
wouldn't know a joke if they met one.
Moreover, they wouldn't greet it if they
did, because they "haven't time for non
sense."
But, the gods be thanked, there aren't
many of this solemn sisterhood in club
dom, and therein lies the greatest
achievement of women's clubs. '
Women's lives are largely made up of
a multitude of pin pricksâ the petty an
noyances of the household, that shrivel
and harden the heart and cramp the
brain unless the antidote of love and
laughter be applied. Then, and then only,
is a woman a normal creature and fit
companion for husband and children.
Work and play, prettily balanced, is
what the California Club has pkuined
for the two remaining club days of the
month.
To-mcrrow a programme touching upon
the serious work of the club will be pre
sented. The day will be in charge of the
department of civics, Mrs. Aaron Schloss
chairman. "The Merit System In Political
Administration" -will be discussed by Al
len Garwood Wright, and "The Child and
the State" by Judge F. J. Murasky.
"The Child and the State." by the Judge
of the Juvenile court, over v/hich he has
pre&ided with wonderful tact and wisdom
since its organization, will attract every
live woman in the club, as that great
philanthropy had its origin in the club
fend is still its favorite project.
Then on the following Wednesday the
members will put aside all concernâ Just
for the dayâ for the -.ale victims of cir
cumstances and will sit down to their an
nual breakfast, to eat, laugh and be
merry.
And there are to be toastsâ sublime and
ridiculousâ and it is sincerely to be hoped
that the BUbllme ones will be short and
tlie ridiculous as long as they can stay
funny, and none so long that it spoils a
chat.
The breakfast is in charge of Mrs.
James C. Crawford, chairman; Mme.
Emilia Tojetti. Mrs. J. B. Mitchell, Mrs.
Charles A. Warren and Mrs. Charles
Fonda, with Mrs. Lovell White as toast
mistress.
Twelve o'clockâ not 12:30, as announced
âis the hour set for the breakfast.
The Forum Club women were delight
fully entertained on Wednesday last by
the charming songstress. Mile. Eleanore
Joseph, whose return to San Francisco
from Paris lias been something of a social
and professional ovation.
Assisting her were Miss Lucia Thomp
son and Mrs. Reginald Keene. â¢
On next Wednesday the club will dis
cuss "Current Topics"â \u25a0which, by the
way, is not current gossip (which is said
to be reserved for tea time), but an in
telligent review of important things that
are happening at home and abroad.
This department of clubs, with the pos
sible exception of the parliamentary sec
tiensâwherein women are learning to
think straightâ is the most valuable part
of cultural clubs. It furnishes live. In
teresting topics to talk about, and Is
thereby the anti-toxine of gossip and
inane chatter.
On Wednesday Mrs. B. N. Rowley will
lead the discussion.
On the following Wednesday the club
will hold its Christmas high jinks, when
c'en the dignified matrons of the club will
"loosen up" and do things. Only tea,
however, and pale lemonade will be
scrve-i, so no alarming fractures of deco
rum are liable to occur.
On this happy day the club will be the
gue*t* of the president, Mrs. Frank Fred
ericks. And there is an inflexible rule
that there are to be "no guests"â alas!
The Papyrus Club, Mrs. "W. S. Leake
president, had a beautiful time on Friday
last, and one long to be remembered, for
beheld the programme, simply sparkling

â¢âand that is where the Regal way of
copying original styles justifies itself. M^^^^^^l

The Oakland Hornets defe^t^d the

VJrrJa" Association Football League yes
:erdaj- on the gTound at Seventh avenue
ar<l California street. J. D. Robertson
\u25a0was referee. The Eagles played with a
short team. Bain not being on hand.
In ibe first two or three minutes of
I>!ay the Eaples scored a goal, which the
i3,>rnets equalized before the end of the
Sort Deriod. When the referee awarded
1. poal to the Hornets. Dirks, one of the
Kiijrles. was so disgruntled that for a few
j^oments he refused to take part in the
r^rae. but soon, finding: sitting by himself
. n the fence lonely, he joined in the play
a_pain. The ylay was rather tame and in
the second period was almost all in favor
ot the Hornets, who added two goals to
their score. The Hornet forwards did
>-ume pretty passing, Mackenzie,
Chambers and Christensen being con
>picuous. In the second half Mackenzie
played center forward as usual.' *
The Easles lacked the cervices of F. J.
\u25a0Croll. their goalkeeper, who received an
injury in a previous match and is not
cj-peeted to play again this season. Rich
\er, however, proved quite efficient and
*he back line worked hard, frequently
robbing the Hornet forwards of the

means up to its full strength, Elliot,
captain and full back, McLachlan and
Duncan I being absent. Yon Helms
rendered rood service in the back line
and was rarely passed. The teams lined

\u25a0 "A large' number of riflemen gathered at
Schuetzen Park yesterday to' greet
liam Koenig, bneof^ the organizers of the
California Schuetzen â¢ Club and also ; -a.
member v of the famous Centennial rifle
team that journeyed from San Francisco
to Philadelphia in 1876 and \ carried off
first honors from .the- : picked ;' marksmen
of the "world. Mr. ; Koenig = has been \u25a0 ab
sent from this State for more than twen
ty-five years. ' During ? that .: time \ he ; has
inspected the â¢-, rliie f ranges of Germany,
Switzerland 'and other countries and says
there is no range that can 'compare in
equipment with Schuetzen* ; Park. . \u25a0\u0084
When the veteran marksman was in
troduced by President Philo Jacoby |on
the shooting , stand he received a â¢ warm
welcome from the assembled.partlcipants.
Ho was induced to participate in his fa
vorite pastime. His hand and , nerve
proved as steady^ as ! ln olden days .when
he made three 2-inch bull3eyes in his
first three shots at 'a distance of "200 yards
at the Centennial shoot at Philadelphia.''
Mr. and Mrs. Koenig were the 1 .- guest 3
of the club at luncheon and old-time
memories were revived In speeches 'made
by William Ehrenpfort, Philo Jacoby,
Captain F. A. Kuhls, A. Rahwyler and
other enthusiasts.
George Tammeyer, one of the first ca
dets ot the California club, carried off
the honors in the medal competition with
the fine score of 2214 rings fin his seven
shot record. This moves him into the
first 'champion class. .
Chris Meyer of the California Schuetzen
Club was the lucky man to carry off the
Reubfld trophy and also the * first prize
in the -, California Schuetzen. Club for
making the best bullssye in the' yearly
competition shoot with 39 points. : He was
followed by W. G. Hoffman ,120/ Otto

G. MS Barley carried off the first prize
in the yearly contest on the pistol tar
get. Otto Nolte was tha winner of .; the
Babin trophy in the same event.
The yearly wind up of the Grutli Club
proved exciting, as many close scores had
been mad,e. A. Studer proved the cham
pion of the occasion!; He? carried off the
Reubold silver, goblet with the good score
of 559 pdlnts in his beat three, bullseyes.
The best individual score of the. year wa3
made by Charles Muller with 103 points;

Short ends scored with unusual
frequency \u25a0at â¢ Ingleslde Coursing Park
yesterday, the, backers of: the favorite*
meeting with reverse after reverse. At
the. end, of the, day's sport their bank
rolls hail diminished - like snow before
the sun. ,\ Speed , was not .'all that was
needed ;tb raise a flag. Many of the
greyhounds which .went to the bare-in
advance of their opponents were beaten
out .by the slower .but -gamer dogs. In
the - champion event T Lady Kelp met
with unusually good luck, having mod
erate running throughout the day. In
the deciding. course Belle Marie, which
.was running ; with great speed, had to
be withdrawn owing to : severe running
in .a previous ' round. The Reserve stake
was left unfinished owing to darkness.
Six dogs still remain in the' stake.
- V : An -unusually large attendance was
present and betting ' was brisk through
out the day. In the first round of \he
Reserve stake Four Paw and Humboldt
ran two.. undecided trials They were
so" evenly matched that they went -to
the slips in each course- at. even money.

Fitzsimmons Stands Up
Under an Hour-s Work of
the Severest Character

O'Brien Pleases His Audience
With His Clever Show
ing in the Gymnasium
If Philadelphia Jack O'Brien has been
harboring the thought that .he .would
meet a jaded athlete in Bob FUssimmons
on Wednesday night In Mechanics* \u25a0 Pa
vilion he is doomed to disappointment. ' .
Fitaslmmons went through his last
hard day's training yesterday at,. Ala-,
meda and stood ub under it in a remark
able manner. ' After he had done an'
hour's violent work Dr. Tisdale exam
ined his heart and found it beating aa
quietly and as regularly as an old-fadh
loned clock. StijlJfJÃ
Fighters before this have trained on un
til the' eve of the battle only to lose all
their form at the last moment Jack
Munroe was a noticeable example of this,
all ' his boyish buoyancy leaving him the*
night before he met Jeffries. Other
fighters do not lose this qualltly until
the milling becomes warm when they
seem unable to make up lost ground. If
Fitzsiznmons is to show deterioration : If
will undoubtedly be after the fight has
gone some distance and O'Erien has car
ried him aloihgr at a fast clip. - ...it.
O'Brien has never been a glutton for
punishment, however, and if Fltzsimmans
lands a few Jolty blows the Philadelpiiian
may not care to carry the fight to him. \u25a0 ."
Tho Coraishman's work consisted of ten
strenuous rounds with the punching bag
and four rounds each with Harry Chester
and Billy -Bates. Fitz3immons never
showed to better advantage In training.
It now remains to be seen if .that ln
tangible qualityâ vitalityâ la stored with
in his muscular frame. Only, the teac
of competition will tell this tale.
' From the waist up Fitz'3 muscles
loom up as prominently as ever. H?9
legs seem small, but they are tha same
supports which" have carried him
through many a hard scrUnma'ge. Al
though small, they are well muscled
and seem without a blemish. He ha*
the same shuffling movement, which*
allows him to glide in and out without
apparent effort. He always seems set
and In position to bit effectively.
In all his work yesterday Fitz
showed he ia still an excellent judge or
both* time and distance, rarely letting 1
gro an ineffective blow." .
In the language of the gymnasium.
Fitz "can make a punching- bag- talk."
He has all the moves of the professional
bas puncher and his skin drew liberal
applause repeatedly from the spectators
who filled his gymnasium, at 60 cents
per head. At times he had the bag
moving- so rapidly that tt Jef t only a
blur before the eyes of the on-lookexs.
He did notary to swap punches with
his sparring mates when he donned the,
gloves, as he did. not wish to Injure
his precious but gnarled bands on . tha â¢
eve of . his '\u25a0 engagement -with O'Brien.
He let them do the leading and! forcing,
while he tried his footwork. He could
outfelnt his partners without difficulty.
Fitz will come to the city to-night,
putting up "at the Adams Hotel. He.
will do only, gentle exercise, aucn aa t
walking, to maintain his present con
dition until "Wednesday night.
\u0084 Jack O'Brien spent a busy day ac
Sheehan's out at the Ocean Beach. He
took his usual run in tbe morning; down
the boulevard, covering about seven
miles. He went into the gymnasium at
3:30 o'clock and worked without a let
up for three-quarters of an hour. In
addition- to his work on the punching 1
bag and the weights he boxed two
rounds with Willie Fitzgerald and four
rounds with Battling 1 Swanacn, his reg
ular sparring mate.' H& showed the
spectators all his dexterity and shifti
ness of foot and made an excellent lm- ,
pression. He should be in the best pos-"~
sible condition on Wednesday night.
when he has a bl.tr contract on his
hands. Â» ' â¢ .
Tou cannot tell the depth of a man's
'Wisdom by the intensity of hi? silence.
