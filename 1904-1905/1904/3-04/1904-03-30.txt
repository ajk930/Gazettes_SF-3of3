ST. PETERSBURG, March 29.âGen
eral Kuropatkin. in his first report to
the Emx>eror from the scene of war,
announced that offensive land opera
tions had taken place against the Jap
anese upon the sixth anniversary of the
occupation of Port Arthur by the Rus
sians. These operations took the form
of & cavalry attack yesterday by six
companies of Cossacks, led possibly by
General Mischtchenko against four
squadrons of Japanese cavalry which
the general believed to be beyond
Chongju. but which he found to be in
occupation of that town. Despite a
cross flre which General Mischtchenko
cleverly directed asainst the enemy, he
pays a tribute to the tenacity and
bravery of the Japanese, who ceased
fire only after a combat which lasted
for a half hour. Before the Russians
could follow up their advantage three
Japanese squadrons galloped toward
the town, which two of them succeeded
in entering, while the third was driven
back in disorder, men and horses fall
ing. The fire maintained upon the
town was so destructive that the Jap
anese were unable to make effective
return.
Further Japanese reinforcements ar
rived an hour later and, in, view of the
superiority of the enemy. General
Mischtchenko determined to retire,
doing so without 'embarrassment, al-
though he carried with him three killed
and fifteen wounded. Â«.â¢
General. Mischtchenko's Cossacks
have been endeavoring for some days
to come into contact with the Japanese
patrols, but the latter refused to com
bat. The. skirmish of to-day will have
the effect of encouraging the Russians
to retard as much as possible the.ad
vance of the Japanese army. â¢ :
General Kuropatkin's dispatch re

tions, as published, does not give the
place of its origin, but it is presumed

The manager of the Palace, Colonel

twenty-five years ago and has ever

a force of Russians at .Tyonjyn, near Pingyang, last Sunday morning. The Russians had erected
a temporary fortress, which was defended by a force of Cossack cavalry, estimated in number
'The Japanese attacked in considerable force. The Russians offered a strong resistance at
first, but finally fell back, abandoning their position. The Japanese sustained a loss of one officer
and-onje sergeant killed and two officers and ten privates wounded. The Russians are reported to
have left three'desrd behind, but to have succeeded in carrying oft a number of wounded. The Jap
anese. for*:e entered the town, cheering for the Emperor.
" 'An hour and a half after the beginning of the engagement four companies were seen on the
Kasan road hastening to attack. I gave the order to mount, and the entire . force, with a covering
squadron, advanced in perfect order and formed in line behind the hill. The wounded were placed
in front, and the retirement was carried out with the deliberation of a parade.
" 'The Japanese squadron, which was thrown into disorder, was evidently unable to occupy
the hill which we had just evacuated, and their infantry arrived too late.
'* 'The detachment protecting our rear arrived quietly at Kasan. where we halted for two
hours in order to give attention to our wounded. At 4 p. m. our force reached Noosan.
; . " 'It is supposed the Japanese had heavy losses in men and horses. On our side three officers
were severely wounded. Three Cossacks t were killed and twelve wounded, including five seriously.'
"General Mischtchenko bears witness to the excellent conduct and gallantry of the officers and
Cossacks, and especially praises the Third Company of the Argunsk Regiment."
Japanese Say Russians Abandoned Dead.
" *In the town a company of infantry and a squadron of cavalry were lying" in ambush. Our %.
men v/ere reinforced by three companies and attacked the Japanese with a cross fire. Notwithstand-";
ing this and our commanding:, position, the Japanese-gallantly held^hcfr ground* and- it -was-only after*\
a fierce fight oÂ£ a half-hour's duration that the Japanese ceased firing and sought "refuge, /in the

"'Soon afterward three squadrons of the enemy were seen advancing along the Kasan road
at full gallop toward the town, which two of the squadrons succeeded in entering, while the third

"I have the honor to respectfully communicate to your Majesty the report of General
Mischtchenko. dated March 28 at 10 p. m.. which says:
" 'For three successive days our small outposts attempted to draw the Japanese cavalry into
action, but their patrols, after contact was established, retired beyond Chongju (about fifty miles
northwest of Pingyang). "**Â¦
" 'Having learned that four squadrons of the enemy were posted five versts beyond Chongju
on :March 27, six companies marched toward Kasan, and on March 28 reached Chongju at 10 :$o

Chinese Justice.
Letters reaching Paris from Hanoe
describe the Chinese border province of
Kwangsi as a perfect cauldron of re
bellion and throw a strong light on
Chinese justice. Marshal Su, the com
mander In chief of the province, had
been pronounced guilty of incapacity,
for which the penalty is the moat ter
rible even in the Chinese code â slow
death. This awful punishment is drawn
out during from three to eight days,
and begins with the removing of the
hails from fingers and toes, then the
loosening of the muscles from arms
and legs. Thence the torture proceeded
to the trunk and upward to the head,
eyelashes, eyelids and finally the eyes
being torn out. Su was placed in a
cell full of lugubrious reminders, but
procured better quarters by a bribe of
7000 taels, and finally secured pardon
by disgorging the official plunder of a
lifetime.â London Globe.

WASHINGTON, March 29. â After
two days' consideration of the post
office" appropriation bill the Senate
committee reported it to-night 'and it
will be taiÂ£en up in the Senate to
morrow. / On account of its incom
plete the exact amount of in
crease made cannot be given, though
it is said the bill will carry over
$1,000,000 more than the bill passed
by the House. The House bill pro
vides for the rental of the Pennsyl
vania Railroad site in New York City
for postomce purposes, but the Senate
committee decided that it would be
better business policy to buy the
site. Therefore an appropriation of
$2,000,000 is made for that purpose.
Among the important amendments
to the bill are the following:
The salaries of rural free delivery
carriers are fixed at $720 a year, and
the carriers are permitted to carry
merchandise for hire and receive sub
scriptions for and deliver newspapers
and periodicals so long as this occupa
tion does not interfere with the proper
discharge of their duties. It is stipu
lated, however, that the carriers shall
not discriminate against any news
paper.
The committee adopted an amend
ment for the purchase or rental of
canceling machines.
Provision for the ' payment of the
Oceanic Steamship Company at a rate
of $1 per mile for carrying of mail
between San Francisco and Tahiti was
restored to the bill. This provision
has been in the Senate provisions for a
number of years, but was eliminated
by the House at this session on the
ground that it was in .the nature of a
subsidy.
The Senate committee has restricted
the payment to $45,000 annually.

ter to Captain Martin. Detective Cody
was detailed to find Bellstedt and ar
rested him at his home. 23G0 Twenty
first street. Bellstedt's name was
placed 'on the detinue book pending the
Issuance of the warrant this morning
In an interview last night Charles
Bt'Hsteclt said: "I .went out of town
last Sunday in order to raise enough
money to pay my creditors, as I had
fallen down on collectionday to the ex
tent of 5G0&0. I went to Napa and suc
ceeded .in Retting the money, after
which I returned to this city, arriving
hore -only this afternoon! I fail to see
where 1 hÂ£ve committed any crime, as
I ifcd not take the morjey away with
me. Irf fact, my brother Theodore col
lected the money here, not L"
When asked why he did not pay out
the amount collected before he went to
Napa, he said he wanted to hold it un
til he could get enough to pay all his
creditors. "I have enough money now
to pay 75 cents on the 'dollar to all my
creditors," he paid, "and if they treat
me right I will do it to-morrow, other
wise Jet the laA- take its course."
Theodore Bellstedt said last night
that the firm of Bellstedt Brothers
Company owes Charles $2000 in back
salary, and that Charles is Indebted to
men that backed the firm financially to
the extent-of $20,000. He .further claims
that one of the backer* had the place
of business attached yesterday. The
brothers claim that the firm is a cor
poration, bu% refuse to divulge the
names of any of the stockholders be
sides themselves.
It will be seen by Charles Bellstedt's
statement that he claims to have left
this city on Sunday, the day before col
lection day, to get the money needed,
yet he says that on collection day, Mon
day, he found they could -not collect
enough money to pay off the debts.
Laumeister said the creditors had
been warned that Bellstedt was not
all right after they had sold him the
goods and when he drew the money
Monday for the sale of some of the
goods and did not make the payments
CHICAGO, March 29.â "Waste no j
time or strength over trivial differences
concerning modes and methods. Enlist':
under the single banner of civic purity,
righteousness and obedience to law. !
Enlist not, for one campaign only, but 1
for the war." This was the remedy {
for the purification of vice offered by j
Justice David J. .Brewer of the United ;
States Supreme Court in an address
here to-night under the' auspices of the
Municipal Lecture Association. Jus
tice Brewer's theme was "Obedience to
Law the First Civic Duty," and his \
discourse was listened to with marked \
interest by an audience that filled the
Auditorium Theater. . '
Justice Brewer spoke as follows:
It .Is a truism that all should obey the law.
It is a part < of the Anglo-Saxon's political
creed, j Especially is this true wherever the
law is cot made for the citizen, but where the
citizen makes the law. If a number of men
unite in a partnership on equal terms, un
doubtedly the majority should control and the
minority submit to their Judgment or quit the
partnership. Ours is a' government of the peo
ple, by the people and for the people.
The underlying principle of republican In
stitutions is equality. Each man is entitled to
one vote and no more. One man'o vote is as
good and no better than another's. Never,
however, look upon it as property, something 1
for barter and sale. It should be to every true
American like the water of life, without
money and without price. This rule of equal
ity Is the basic principle of our political life,
however short we may come of realizing it.
The declaration of independence is still a living
and glowing truth and not a mere chromo of
dead thought or glittering generalities.
MAJORITY SHOULD RULE.
According to this, the majority determine
and make the law and the minority must obey
or go elsewhere. In our thought there is no
place for resistance to law or for revolution to
overthrow the decisions of the ballot. We do
not live in Panama, and we have no canals to
sell. This duty or" obedience to the law being
conceded, Jt being confessedly the principle
upon which republican government Is founded,
why etop to consider it in relation to munici
pal government? No one will seriously con
tend that there is an obligation to obey the
law of the State or nation, and none to obey
the ordinances of a city, 'iherefore. why dis
cuss that which all admit to be true?
Although confessedly true, there are, never
theless, some thoughts concerning it worthy of
special consideration, some things "which make
it fittlnc that the duty of obedience tn law in
a city should be pressed upon our attention.
The ordinances o* a city are its special laws.
Undoubtedly the laws of a State are enforced
within the limits of the municipality. ThÂ«
criminal law of UM State is as potent within
as without the city limits. To kill a man In
side the city Is just a? much murder as to kill
him in the country. And speaking generally,
the laws of the State ai:d the nation operate
as fully within as without the limits of a
city. But in addition to thoÂ»a laws are the
ordinances of the city enacted diy the city
authorities and operative only within the city.
There are thus more laws requiring obedience.
Further, the ordinances are laws of a special
character, and by reason thereof Justify, spe
cial attention.
CRIME IN CITIES.
And the first' thing which I wish- to suggest
is that there is more violation of law In a
city than elsewhere. There Is more crime in
a city than in the oountry.
There are many reasons for this. One ia
the city is the abiding place of - the criminal.
The opportunities , of escape and the means of
concealment are greater. Now, vice and
crime are business, and they go where prop
erty is and the multitudes are. There also
they find their friends and sympathizers. In
such localities and amid sucH surroundings
their business flourishes.
Another cause is the heterogeneousness of a
city's population. No one of our large cities
is filled with people of a single race. The
world has been' pouring' multitudes on our
shores from every race and clime and they
gravitate toward our large cities. Even in
staid old Boston there are more Irishmen than
Americans. Chicago is pre-eminent in this
respect. Not only is your foreign population
enormous, but it Is made up not from a single
race, but from many. To many of them gov
ernment is an enemy and law means tyranny.
Many find pleasures and practices they have
been accustomed Â¦ to at home (and . which hav
ing been accustomed to they feel are among
their, inalienable rights) taken away altogether
or restricted by municipal laws and police
regulations. Is it strange that ' they fret at
such laws and regulations and disregard them
when possible?
I have thus epoken of some of the causes
of the greater violation In the. city than in the
country. Let me now turn your attention to
some of the results of such violation. And in
order to fully appreciate this we must con
sider why it Is that there are so many minute
police regulations In a city, so many th!r^Â»
forbidden by such regulations which the State
does. not deem necessary to forbid, when done
in the country.
' WHAT LIBERTY MEANS.
Contrast one living on his farm in the coun
try, half a mile from any neighbor, with one
living in the midst of a densely populated
city. - How many more things the former can
do without injury or annoyance to others.
And . the true idea of liberty is not doing
whatever one's judgment or wishes suggest,,
but the right of doli% those things, which j do
not Interfere with the welibelng and
of others. The rights of others .are the bound
aries of every man's liberty. 'The farmer's
wife may throw the \slops fronv.herjkitchen
on the ground; the farmer may jmt his. pig
pen in front 'of his .parlor.; \he may burn .soft
coal and let the black" smoke nourout of his
chimney; he may store gunpowder or nltro
glycerin or gasoline In his barn; he may drive
his horse Â¦ or run an automobile as faÂ»t as
he pleases within the limits of his own farm;
he may let his hogs roam at will, within his
own enclosure if he is content to have buss
and bacteria about him; if he is willing to
risk' the chances of his life or limb, the law
permits it. But* place the same man in a
city v and he. must be restrained in these re
spects because otherwise he offends or en
dangers others. As you stand beneath the
awful shadow of the Iroquols disaster think
for a moment how much it would have meant
to ' this city if all . reasonable precautions
against fire had been prescribed by ordinance
and enforced by municipal officials. Vain ia it
to trust each individual to impose on himself
the needed restraints. Â¦ Many are ignorant of
their, necessity; many < Indifferent to them.
Only : . the strong arm of municipal law can
secure protection to all against the ignorance
or Indifference of the individual.
CAPITAL A MODEL CITY.
Again, the strict enforcement of municipal
regulations - means much, not merely for the
physical safety and comfort, but also for the
moral health of the community. The thought
of stability In office of those -charged with the
duty of preserving the publ'c peace must be
Incorporated Into municipal life. There has
got to be impressed upon all dwellers In a city
a ' full consciousness of the i fact that there is
a power to punish, a power that endures and a
power that will never let up. * Believe me, there
is more In this consciousness of the stability
of power than has yet been recognized as an
element for preserving the peace, tn that sta
bility lies the secret of Washington's muni
cipal success, and that Pf-nse of stability will
be' secured in all our at ties only when a per
manent tenure of office and civil service re
form are established.' ' Â¦ Â¦ - '
, Undoubtedly that government Is thÂ« best
which Interferes with -the free action of the
citizens no further than the protection of the
rights of other : citizens compels; For a city
council or- other governing body to pile up- a
multitude of needless restrictions, is always of
fensive, and when those* restrictions are petty
in character they are exceedingly .irritating.

ferences concerning modes and methods. , Kn

, WASHINGTON, March 29.â The bill
authorizing the erection of an addition
al executive department â¢ building In
Washington. to-day was again the.sub
ject of spirited debate in the Senate,
and after several hours debate it re
mains unacted upon. Senators divided
largely on the question of location, but
there also was talk as to the necessity
of better office accommodations for the
Senate and the Supreme Court.
Fairbanks said that the Government
is now paying an aggregate rental in
the District of Columbia of 5316I249. '-
Spooner contended that attention first
should be given to providing proper ac
commodations for Senators. The Sen
ate annex, or Maltby building, which is
occupied by Senators as an office build-,
ing, he termed a disgrace "to the
country."
Allison said that the proposed addi
Â£ion would make sixty-six rooms, and
in the past there had been unanimous
assurance that the House would sur
render some of the rooms in the south
end of the building, so as to give a
sufficient number of rooms for all Sen
ators. Replying to Newlands, he de
clined to express an opinion as to
whether there would be sufficient ac
commodations for Senators from the
new States. ' ,
"I think," he said, "that we might
take care of Senators from one or two
more States, but I should not want to
enter upon the question as to whether
we are to have two or four States, .or
as to .whether the outlying possessions
are to be admitted â¢ to Statehood."
Teller thought the proposed depart
ment building would be none too large
for the Department of Commerce and
Labor alone,' saying that under the
law creating the department its scope
is limited tÂ»nly by the appropriations
given it. In view of the probable de
mands of the future he suggested the
wisdom of a building commission to
have charge of the entire matter.
Teller declared the pension building
should be torn down because of its
character. He thought the Government
should buy all the property south of
Pennsylvania avenue west of the
Capitol and locate all future public
buildings on that ground.
After further debate the Senate re
jected the amendment of Gallinger fix
ing the . fees of architects at 2V& per
cent, and at 5:30 o'clock adjourned.
For the want of speakers, general de
bate on the sundry civil .appropriation
bill in the House to-day was closed sev
eral hours before the time agreed on
and the bill, was .read for amendment.
Seventy- five pages were disposed , of,
the only important amendment- adopted
'being one providing for 'an Initial ap
propriation of '$500,000 for the comple
tion of the Capitol building according
to the original design. .
Campbell of Kansas and Williams of
Mississippi were the principal speakers
to-day, the former defending-the pro
tective tariff policy of the Republican
party and the latter denouncing the
Republicans for failing to investigate
the Postofflce Department.
Williams said that the scandals In
that department will be an important
issue in the coming campaign. He ar
raigned President Roosevelt and At
torney General Knox regarding the
trusts.
NEW YORK, March 29.â The mem
bers of the Panama Canal Commission
sailed to-day for Colon on the steam
ship Allianca, They will inspect the
entire route of the canal and will look
over some' of the documents of the
Canal Company, preparatory to the de
livery of the property to the United
States Government. They probably will
remain at the isthmus about two
months. '
The commission consists of Rear Ad
miral John C. Walker, Major General
George W. Davis of the District of Co
lumbia, William Barclay Parsons and
William H. Burr, New York; Benjamin
M. Harrow, Louisiana; C. Ewald
Grunsky, California, and Colonel Frank
J. Hecker, Detroit.
The commissioners were accompanied
by Colonel William C. Georgas, assisf
ant surgeon general of the army; Dr.
Lewis La Garde of the medical depart
ment of the army, and Dr. John W.
Ross, medical director of the navy.
Roger Farnham, representing William
Nelson Cromwell, counsel for the Pan
ama Canal Company, also sailed on the
same vessel, i Â¦"-/.>', â¢ . .
The medical men who go with the
commission will make an inspection of
the canal route with particular respect
to the sanitary conditions and will plan
arrangements for the sanitation of the
canal zone.
"Our present plan," said Rear Ad
miral Walker, "is to go over the entire
route of the canal, , making an investi
gation of the work done, the improve
ments that are necessary and the ar
rangements that will have to be made
for proper sanitation of the district."
Special Correspondence of The' Call,
HONOLULU, March 23.â Governor-
Carter has called a special session of
the Legislature to deal with the finan
cial difficulties that confront the Terri
tory. He feels that a reduction of ex
penses amounting to almost $2,000,000
should not be left absolutely in his.
hands, but' that the representatives of
the people should take their share of
the responsibility. Before arriving at
this conclusion he consulted the busi
ness men.' bankerg, lawyers' and legis
lators. As a rule the commercial in
terests of Hawaii are opposed to a spe
cial session, fearing from previous ex
perience that the time would be wasted
and that" the Hawaiian legislators
would accomplish more harm than
good.
Governor Carter, however, has de
cided to take the native legislators into
his confidence, irrespective of party.
He has told them that the opportunity
now exists to show the United States
that they are capable of self-govern
ment and of handling difficult propo
sitions, with care and ability. He has
pointed out that the people on the
mainland will judge them by their
acts and that the future of this Terri
tory, as regards statehood, may un
doubtedly be largely influenced by
their present procedure. This was the
substance of what he plainly told them
at a legislative gathering on Monday
last.
The special session will meet on Tues
day, April 5, and it is not anticipated
with any great degree of pleasure by
the heads of departments, except the
Treasurer, who sees a possible way out
of his troubles. Both Republicans and
Home Rulers who attended the con
ftrence promised to stand by the Gov
ernor.

SURGEOXS RESORT
TO THE KXIFE
When a Simple Home Remedy Cures.
Why do physicians always advise an
operation for the cure of hemorrhoids,
or piles? Are they unconsciously in-
fluenced by the dicta of operating sur-
geons, who stoutly assert and maintain
that all other treatments are merely
palliative, and that the knife affords
the only means of cure?
There could be no greater fallacy, as
the worst possible cases of piles are
permanently cured by the use of Pyra-
mid Pile Cure, which is in suppository
form, is applied directly to the source
of the complaint, and removes the
cause, which an operation does not.
"I have been a sufferer from piles for
over forty . years, and after trying
everything I could hear or read of.
without benefit or relief, I came to the
conclusion to give Pyramid Pile Cure
a trial, and I can truly say it has given
mt- entire satisfaction; it is a wonder-
ful remedy.' The bleeding has entirely
ceased, thp protruding has stopped,
there is no longer any itching, and I
feel no swelling of the parts; in fact I
feel like, a new man.
"I had to wear a truss for several
years, to keep the bowel up, but I have
now discarded it, after using six boxes
of Pyramid Pile Cure. I think after
forty years of suffering, the six boxes
was a small amount to make such an
agreeable change, as I was unable to
do any work that required stooping in
the last eight years. l t recommend
Pyramid Pile Cure to every one with
whom I come in contact, as I consider
it beyond price." Geo. V?,. Ivey, Con-
federate Soldiers' Home, Richmond,

â¢We vouch for the truth and accuracy
of the "above testimonial, and urge all
sufferers to purchase* a fifty cent pack-

member there is no remedy, "just as
good."

A Rheumatic My st9jy v
Here are some marvels of medicine!
A dose of Aconite will climax at three
o'clock in the morning.
Aloes will operate at live o'clpcX A. M.
and Sulphur at eleven o'clock.
No matter what time, in the preceding
day, you have taken these medicines,
they will climax at the fixed hours here
stated and reveal certain symptoms al-
ways.
How do you account for this?
How account for a Rheumatic per-
son's ability to predict a coming storm
24 hours ahead, by the peculiar ache in
his bones?
Rheumatism is simply Uric Acid in
the blood. Can Uric Acid have its time
limit, like other chemicals, but reflect-
ing/backward like a barometer? .
Uric Acid is due to a lack of Alkaline
material in the blood. This Acid absorbs
the debris, or waste matter, of the sys-
tem.
It carries this waste matter into the
blood, when there aro not enough Alka-
line elements (like salt or soda) to
neutralize the Uric Acta, and to free the
debris before it reaches the kidneys.
As the blood circulates through the
system, it then deposits small particles
of this waste matter in the joints and
muscles. '.V^i.
| These particles are like granulated
j sugar, or sand, and "they grind between
[ the joints and muscles at every move-
iSnent.
This grinding- causes intense pain and
inflammation, frequently. If the disease
be not checked, the inflammation will
cause the Uric particles to be coated
with a fleshy cushion, which In time
grows to the joints as well. Then "bony
joints" and crooked limbs ensue.
The only way to cure Rheumatism is
to convert the Acid condition of the
blood Into an Alkaline. Then to dis-
solve, and carry away, the deposits Ia
joints and muscles.
j Then, to get the digestive organs into
j a normal condition, so they will secrete,
without further help, less Acid and
â¢ more Alkaline*. Upon this condition
t depends cure, and the permanence of
i cure. But â It is useless to kill Rheu-
! matism If we also kill the stomach in
I doing so.
Few drugs powerful enough to dis-
solve Uric Acid deposits are safe to
take into the stomach. This is why
; so-called "quick cures" are dangerous.
Rheumatism is slowly acquired, and
so, a cure cannot be expected in a few
i weeks' treatment, and never by external
applications. The first essential in a
Rheumatic cure is safety â the 'second,
effectiveness â the third, permanence. -
In a medical experience of thirty years
I have known but one remedy which
combined these three qualities. It took
nearly ten years of my life to discover
and perfect that remedy.
The chief ingredient I found in Ger-
many, and to this I added, subtracted
from, and combined, until I now have a
prescription on which I daily stake for-
tune and repute.
After 2000 test cases I found that "Dr.
; Shoop's Rheumatic Cure" succeeded In
i 39 out of each 40 cases. Then I decided
Â¦ it was safe to supply it on a month's
trial, at my ri3k, to Rheumatic sufferers
everywhere.
If lt fails, the treatment and six bot-
tles of Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cure cost
you not a farthing, and I bear the whole
cost myself without question.
If lt succeeds, the cost to you Is but
$5.50. This Is no mere sample proposi-
tion, but a practical guarantee of suc-
cess or no pay. "Write me to-day â before

POPE PI US IS IN NO
FEAR OF ASSASSINS
Report That l^arge Force of Soldiers
Is Guarding the Vatican Is
Ridiculed.
ROME, March 29. â The report, pub
lished by the Daily Chronicle of Lon
don and cabled to the United States,
that the Vatican has for days past
been guarded by a large force of Ital
ian soldiers and police, owing to ?ho
discovery of a plot against the life of
the Pope, is ridiculed by the Vatican
authorities, who say that the number
of carbineers and policemen on duty
at the papal palace is no larger than
usual.
Further investigation developed the
fact that the rumor of an alleged plot
against the life of the Pope originated
in a statement that two Italian anar
chists would arrive at Genoa from
South America next week with the in
tention of making an attempt to as
sassinate the Pontiff. The report was
ridiculed by the authorities.
[OFFICIALS OF STEEL

George W. Perkins, chairman of the

ner of Philadelphia, also of that com
mittee, were in conference with J. P.
Morgan to-day and the financial dis
trict took it for granted that some
thing has been done regarding the
next dividend on steel preferred.
According to a director of the cor
poration the question of maintaining
or reducing the present 7 per cent
rate will not be determined much In
advance of the quarterly meeting next
Tuesday. The finance and executive
committees are scheduled to meet to

XEW YORK, March 29. â A story
of an alleged plot to assassinate Pres
ident Roosevelt, which upon investi
gation proved to be entirely without
foundation, was made public to-day
by Police Commissioner Adoo.
Several days ago the Commissioner
received a letter from a man in Italy
saying that an Italian was about to
come to this country for the express
purpose of assassinating the Presi
dent. The writer gave a detailed de
scription of the alleged anarchist, the
steamer on which he would sail and
full details of the alleged Dlot.
When the steamer docked an inspec
tor was on hand with a large squad
of detectives and the suspect was
found and detained. Investigation,
however, showed that the case was
purely one of spite on the part of the
man who ijwrote the letter. It was
found that the detained man was not
an anarchist and that he had a perfect
right to enter the United States. ,He
was allowed to land. The^object of
the letter, it was found, was to have
the man deported.
NEW HAA'EN. Conn., March 29.â The
appeal of William Jennings Bryan from
the decision of Probate Judge Cleave
land in relation, to the will of Philo S.
Bennett, 'of which Bryan is an execu
tor, was heard In the Superior Court
to-day before Judge Edwin B. Gager
and a jury. Bryan appeals from the
Probate Court's'decision that the sealed
letter mentioned in the will is not a
part of the will. By this letter Bennett
expressed a wish that Br yan have a
gift c-f $50,000, of which $10,000 was to
go to Mrs. Bryan and $15,000 to be held
in trust for their children, the remain
der to be for Bryan himself. Bryan
was present in court, but Mrs. Bryan,
who accompanied him here from Ne
braska, was not in the room.
When James K. Blake, clerk of the
Probate Court, was called as the first
witness there was much sparring be
tween counsel over technicalities relat
ing tc- the identification of thc wili and
the sealed letter from the court
Every question asked by counsel for
Bryan was objected to by the other
side. The will was entered as "exhibit
A," and the sealed letter was "exhibit
B."
These entries, however, were for pur
poses of identification only. When an
attempt was made by counsel for Bry
an to- offer the sealed letter as evi
dence counsel for the appellees object
ed, saying that when the proper time
came he would debate the question of
the admission of the paper as a mattÂ«r
of la'w. . He held that the sealed letter
was not admissible. At the suggestion
of the court, the offer of the letter as
evidence was withdrawn for the pres
ent. Objections were also made to the
admission of evidence of the will and
the inventory of the estate. These ob
jections were sustained and the docu
ments excluded temporarily.
LONDON*. March 29. â The usual
motion providing for the adjournment
of the House of Commons over the
Easter holidays gave the Liberal
leader. Sir Henry Campbell-Banner
man, an opportunity to make a spirit
ed attack on the Government. He
caustically criticized in detail the
whole policy of the Ministry, which,
he declared, except in the matter of
Chinese labor, was marked by "inde
cision, confusion and vacillation; a
tortuous course and a misty atmos
phere." Sir Henry added that he did
not think it was in accordance with
the spirit of tho^constitution that Pre
mier Balfour should retain power
when the country had shown at every
opportunity afforded it that he no
.longer enjoyed its favor.
Balfour, replying, said he noted the
anxiety of the Liberal leader that he
should resign, but he was quite un
able to see why the Government
should take the unprecedented course
of resigning office while It retained
the confidence of the House. He
agreed with Lord Rosebery that the
country shouTd not be rushed in re
gard to the fiscal question, and pointed
out that the Government majority
even now was larger tha'n the majority
with which Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nerman assumed office in order to car
ry home rule. There were no reasons
why the courage of the Unionists
should be less than that of the Liber
als, nor why the Unionists should re
linquish their task because faint-heart
edness had been shown in some direc
tions. Sir Henry could settle the ques
tion of the Government's resignation
or not by a vote of censure.
Balfour concluded with declaring
that the Government's fiscal policy was
that of real, progressive free trade.
When Winston Spencer Churchill
(Conservative) rose and pressed Bal
four for a further explanation of the
Government's fiscal policy, saying the
vacillation of the Government had
caused him to become one of its op
ponents instead of one of its support
ers, the Premier and all the Unionists
except ten trooped out of the House.
The incident led to protests on the
part of the other members against the
discourtesy shown Churchill.

She left Rome -at an early hour by

boarded the Rey Umberto and, after
half an hour"s chat, the Queen accom

where they had lunch.
The Queen was heard to say as she
left the Hohenzollern for the Rey
Umherto:
"Now, I have determined to visit
Germany," to which Emperor William
replied:
"As a friend. I hope."

' The situation between Russia and

PEKING, March 29. â Paul Lesser,
the Russian Minister, here, is accused
of systematically endeavoring to bring

patience of the Chinese by insolent
nagging of the Foreign Office with
petty complaints and unwarrantable
demands. He almost assumes . the
right to command the Chinese army
on the Manchurian frontier. The Min
ister's conduct is attributed partly to
personal ill feeling on account of his
failure to prevent China opening ports
to foreign trade and partly to a desire
to alter the balance of prestige as be

WASHINGTON, * March 29.â Count
Cassini, the Russian Embassador, has
delivered to the State Department the
following notes:
"I have the honor, by direction of
my Government, to bring to the atten
tion of your Excellency that the Red
Cross has fitted up a, floating hospital
on board a steamer of the Eastern
Chinese Railroad' Company now at
Port Arthur, and that the necessary
steps have been taken in all that con
cerns its exterior painting, Its crew
and equipment in order that the ves
sel may comply with the stipulations
of The Hague conference concerning
the application to maritime warfare
of the principle of the convention of
Geneva, of August, 1864."
"By order of my Government I have
the honor to bring to the attention of
your Excellency that, owing to exist
ing circumstances, the lieutenant of
his Majesty in the Far East finds him
self under the necessity of causing
mines to be laid at the mouth of the
Llao River, near Ylnkow. Neutral
merchant vessels may still be freely
admitted into the above named port,
on condition that they shall comply
with the regulations issued for the pur
pose."
Yinkow is the port of Newchwang,
at the mouth of Liao River.
While the situation at sea is regarded
as less clearly under the complete mas
tery of Admiral Togo, it is not believed
that Admiral Makaroff's vessels are in
a position to do much damage. It is
expected that they will remain close
e;.nugh to Port Arthur to be in a posi
tion to refreat under the cover of the
shore batteries In case of emergency.
No Japanese report of the land opera,
tions !n Korea has been received here
and there is much speculation as to
the size of the opposing armies, re
garding which there is no reliable In
formation.
A correspondent at Russian head
quarters in Mukden telegraphs that ac
cording to reports received there about
10,000 Japanese have crossed the river
at Chinchangau f.nd 5000 have ad
vanced north from Chongju.
The Chronicle's Shanghai corre
spondent assertB that - practically the
whole Japanese army in. Korea, con
sisting of 100,000 men, is concentrated
at Pukcheng and Anju, only small de
tachments being left In Southern Korea
to maintain communication.
A St. Petersburg special says that a'
Russian division of 25,000 men from
Southern Ussuri Is advancing in two
columns through Korea. ' The main
column, coming along the east coast
road, reached Pukcheng, 180 miles from
Tumen River, and a flanking column,
consisting of Cossacks and mountain
artillery, coming along the valley of
the Tumen River toward Its source, has
reached the coast of Lake Tadjl; This
column reports that the Japanese are
advancing north from Tonsan and
that their advance guard is encamped
at Chongping.
Is is expected that when the major
ity ot Kuropatkin's troops are in the re
gion between Liaoyang and the Yalu
River the Japanese will attempt to cut
the Russian communications and try
conclusions within easy reach of the
sea, which is the true base of the Mi
kado's army. Meanwhile an entire
army corpus ;fs ready for- action in r the
northern" end "of JapanT and can* be
moved at an hour's notice toward any
point where the Mikado's generals be
lieve the Russians are least able to op
pose it.
According to all experts, heavy blows
must begin to fall within a few days.
It is accepted as certain that, wherever
or in whatever manner Japan may at
tack, she will reserve ample forces to
execute those flanking movements to
which the Japanese strategists have
from the first pinned great faith.
LONDON, March 29.â Students of the
military situation in the Far East are
becoming convinced that the delay in
the- Japanese operations, which was due
at first to climatic difficulties, is now
the result of a desire to permit Rus
sians to complete the mobilization of
the main Manchurian army south of
Mukden. It is apparent that the Japan
ese have made no effort whatever to
prevent this mobilization, although
they might at any time have dispatched
raiding parties to destroy the railway.

PINGYANG (via Shanghai). March
29. â The Chengcheng River at pres
ent is the line dividing the Japanese
and Russian forces. Anju is held in
force by 1500 Japanese, who are be
ing continually reinforced from Ping
yang and, latterly, also from Che
nampho. The latter city is being
strengthened as part of the Japanese
scheme to offer a determined resist
ance in the event of a forced retreat.
Similarly all strategical points have
been fortified -as the advance pro
gresses.
The Pingyang walls and gates have
been fortified. On the hills overlook
ing the city the Japanese have mount
ed guns. The work has been in prog
ress for the last five years, disguised
army officers and other spies having
been busy, so that now the Japanese
advance with a knowledge of all nec
essary points in the strategical scheme
and these are. now being quietly and
effectively occupied.
The territory north of Chengcheng
River is still Russian. The main routes
are filled with cavalry. Each party is

FRANCE SIDES WITir ALLY.
LONDON. March 29.â The British
Government has no- intention of pro
testing against the Russian action in
declaring martial law at Newchwang.
An endeavor will be made in the ordi
nary way and after, the cessation of
hostilities to secure compensation for
such British merchants as are pecu
niarily affected. It has not yet been
decided whether the British Consul will
remain at Newchwang, but this is not
considered of serious importance. It
is pointed out at the Foreign Office that
neither the United States nor Great
Britain ever considered Newchwang
neutral, and when Secretary Hay's note
was received it was tacitly admitted
that Newchwang might quite likely be
one of the points of a Japanese attack
and the Russians are considered quite
within their rights in taking the neces
sary steps to prevent possible Japanese
aggression. . *%'"'..
At the Japanese legation the Rus
sian proclamation of martial law at
Newchwang was believed to- be rather
favorable to Japan than otherwise, as
it eliminates any protest on the part
of the other powers In the event of an
attack on Newchwang by Vice Admiral
Togo. American, German and other
diplomatic circles here- agree with the
British view that there is no ground
for complaint. against Russia! Several
of the afternoon papers, however, bit
terly attack Viceroy. A lex left's procla
mation and demand that Great'Britain
and the United States forcibly: protest
against it.*
A correspondent of the Times at
Newchwang, cabling under yesterday's
date, says: "The Russians to-day or
dered ? the American flag on the'cor
respondents' mess to be hauled down.'
The proclamation of martial law^com
pletely paralyzed the whole commerce
of this port."
The Chinese Minister to-day notified
Secretary Hay that Prince Pulin, the
Imperial Chinese Minister to the
World's Fair, would sail to-morrow for
his post from Yokohama.
BRITAIN NOT OFFKNDED.
However, the. State Department has
determined to move with the utmost
circumspection and deliberation in
taking any action or lodging any pro
test which might convey the impres
sion that the United States was in
jecting itself Into the present struggle
without the" most pressing necessity.
In fact, it is stated that it is the in
tention to let matters run along for a
while, in order to allow actual experi
ence to determine whether America's
interests really suffer from any of the
acts taken by either of the belliger
ents in Manchuria as a result of these
various notices and proclamations.
Part of this policy is to_ refrain from
hurrying to their posts Cheshire juid
Davidson, . the American Consuls to
Mukden and Antung, respectively.
Mukden is an armed camp and An
tung is in the very vortex of the war,
and it is realized here that it might
be embarrassing to the belligerents to
have foreign Consuls newly located
there, especially as their coming could
not be defended Â«n the ground of trade
necessity, for there is no trade at pres
ent between these towns and the United
States.
Nor does Conger refer to the report
ed notice from the Russian authorities
at Newchwang to the Consuls that
they may no longer exercise consular
Jurishdlction and consular functions,
especially extraterritorial Jurisdiction.
It ts said that if any such action has
been taken it will raise a very serious
question for the Consuls to exercise
their power in this treaty port under
treaty stipulation with a sovereign
power which is not a party to the war.
It is not recalled, moreover, that It
has been customary in time of war for
a belligerent to undertake to deprive
Consuls of their functions.
HAY ACTS WITH CAUTION".

named Kreautlar, an employe of the
Russo-Chinese Bank, has been ap
pointed French Consular Agent at
Newchwang. He has hoisted the
French flag over the bank buildings,
it Is considered probable that this is a
forerunner of a movement to fly the
tricolor over all the Russian Govern
ment buildings at Newchwang.
WASHINGTON, March 29.â Minister
Conger has cabled the State Depart
ment from Peking that the Russian
authorities have declared martial law
at Newchwang, and have formally
notified all foreigners.
Conger's message makes no reference
to the reported hauling down of for
eign flags by the Russians. The offi
cials here assume that if this has been
done it simply means that Russia has
assumed the responsibility for the pro
tection of foreign property belonging
to the belligerents, and that no effort
will be made to interfere with the
consular flags.
It is also ju>inted out that Russia
save notice W the foreign governments
before laying 'torpedoes, in the harbor
of Newchwang and gave notice also of
pther defensive measures. It is main
tained that, since this brought no pro
test, Russia's' right to adopt all the
necessary defensive measures is con

declared that the revival of martial
spirit at Port Arthur since the arrival

struction of the Russian shirs at
Chemulpo permitted the first landing
there. Japan's later naval successes
now permit a landing at Chemulpo and
possibly even farther north.
HOPES TO KNTRAP ItUSSIAXS.
There are no Russians now south of
the Anju River, and it is estimated
that there are not more than 5000 Rus
sians between the Chengcheng and
Yalu rivers.
General Sasaka hopes to land a suf
ficient force at the mouth of the Yalu
to cut off the retreat of these troops.
Then the Japanese objective will be the
Manchurian city of Pongwangsang,
sixty miles north of the Yalu, which is
an important strategic- point.

The IlrKt land engagement of consequence since the war between Russia and Japan waa begun has
been fought ut Chongju, Â»v town northwest of Pingyang, the Japanese base on the western slope of Korea,
during Uie advance toward the Ynln. While the forces engaged .were not large, both infantry and cavalry
were brought into play. The Russians made a Qcrco attack upon the town, which was gallantly held by
tlic .lupniiiM' and rvcntunlly the Russian commander withdrew his forces when reinforcements for the
town's defenders appeared in sight. The Russian loss, according to an official . report to the Czar, was three
killed nnd fifteen wounded, while the Japanese report their loss as two killed and twelve wounded.
An interesting review of land operations In Korea develops the fact that, In addition to the armies
that face one -another on the Yalu, both " Hii&du and .Japan have large forces advancing through, East
ern Korea, the former descending from the north in two bodies nnd the latter advancing -northward from a
point of debarkation on the eastern coast of the. "hermit kingdom." Besides her Korean armies, Japan
has landed many troops on the islands off the coast of l.tnotuns Peninsula, whence they will ultimately

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the
most Bucceasful and most, widely
known of any remedy for stomach
troubles because It is the most rea-
sonable and scientific of modern med-
icines.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold
by every druggist In the United States
and Canada, as well as in Great Bri-
tain, at 50 cents for complete- treat-
ment.
Nothing further is required to cure
any stomach trouble or to make thin,
nervous, dyspeptic people strong,
plump and well.
But the trouble is that while we eat
enough and generally too much, the
stomach, from abuse and overwork,
does not properly digest and assimilate
it, which is the reason eo many peo-
ple remain thin and under weight
the digestive organs do not complete-
ly digest the flesh v forming beefsteak
and eggs and similar wholesome food.
There are thousands of such .who
are really confirmed dyspeptics, al-
though they may have no particular
pain ' or inconvenienge . from their
stomachs.
If such persons would lay their
prejudices aside and make a regular
practice of taking, after each meal,
one or two of Stuart's Dyspy^sia Tab-
lets the food would be quickly and
thoroughly digested, because these
tablets contain the natural peptones
and dlastate which every. weak stom-
ach lacks, and by supplying this want
the stomach is soon enabled to regain
its natural tone and visor.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets digest
every form of flesh forming- food,
meat, eggsf bread and potatoes, and
this Is the reason they so quickly build
up, strengthen and invigorate' thin,
dyspeptic men, women and children.
Common sense would suggest that
if one wishes to become lleshv and
plump it can only result from the food
we eat and digest and that food
should be albuminous of flesh forming
food, like eggs, beefsteak and cereals;
In other words the kinds of food that
make flesh are the foods which farm
the greater part of our daily bills of.
fare.

see the famous herd of buffaloes on
the Flathead reservation. This herd is
300 in number and is Quite the lar
gest herd in captivity in the world.
Some thirty years ago a ragged, bare
footed half breed named Peblo arrived
at, the' reservation and went to work
for 'wages until he was able to get
a small start in the Â«stock business.
Fifteen years later he purchased 40
head of buffaloes from Buffalo Bill
at a low figure, and from that be
ginning his herd has grown to Its
present^ size.
He finds a good market for the ani
mals at $500 apiece: showmen, me

ing his principal customers. The herd
roams at will on a range ten miles
square and are constantly under the
watchful eye of a cowboy, who counts
and examines them daily.

traveling many . miles for the express

The decision of the British Govern

don papers to draw on some early
writings of Mark Twain for alluring
pictures of John Chinaman when, his
day's labors in the mines done, he will
give himself up. to his favorite pastime.
Mr. Clemens, it will be remembered,
years ago, when a young reporter on
the Virginia City Enterprise, wrote a
series of articles describing the Chinese
quarter in tfiat city. Very vividly he
pictured the scenes in the small cooped
up dens, unlighted save by the sickly,
guttering tallow candle, where barely
outlined in the gloom could be seen
"two or three yellow, long-tailed vaga
bonds coiled up in a sort of truckle-bed
smoking opium, motionless and with
their lusterless ?yes turned inward,

street to Second, thence north on Sec

street to First. At the edge of the
city limits the railway follaws the Al
viso road for a short distance and
then goes along a private right of way.
The landing of the road will be a cou
ple of miles from Alviso at deep water
on the bay. A town will be laid out,
and there will be enough water at lenv
tide to permit large ships to dock. A
line of fast steamers will connect with
the electric railway there to carry
freight and passengers to San Fran
cisco. A branch of the railway will
run from Alviso to Palo Alto, and an
other branch to Milpitas.
A rumor has it that the Haywards
electric line will build from Haywards
to connect with the branch running to
Milpitas. Then- with the construction
of an electric road from San Mateo to

electric line from San Francisco to

Moi and Ah both say that the
men were all strangers to them and
that with one exception they could not
identify them.
Moi Kin Chong and Ah Kong, pro
prietors of a small merchandise store
at 704 Jackson street, were 'held up
by six or seven Chinese robbers just
before closing iip their store at mid
night last night. The thieves walked
into the store and asked one of the
proprietors to sell them a bottle of
gin. While he was getting it they
pulled out their revolvers and ordered
both the shopkeepers to throw up
their hands.
The robbers searched the pockets of
their victims and emptied the till, tak
ing about 575. Next they tied the pro
prietors to chairs and told them to
surrender the safe key.

Collins is accused by, Barry and
Clough of having appeared as counsel
for both plaintiff and defendant in the
action of the Hibernia Savings and
Loan Society vs. Charles H. Robinson.
Collins made sensational ; charges sev
eral days ago of incompetence and bias
against Superior Judge Kerrigan, who
decided the case, and will endeavor to
have the juris't removed- from the bench
by filing charges with Governor Pardee.
In his letter Collins says the charge
is willfully, maliciously and viciously
false and was known [ to be false and
untrue- by the persons who made it.
He declares that at no time and in
no manner, either verbally or in writ-
Ing, did the defendant consult or in
terview him or did he advise the de
fendant in reference to the claim. The
allegation of his accusers that the
promissory note in the case is ficti
tious or fraudulent, Collins says, is ab
solutely false. In closing, he asks the
Bar Association to take notice of "these
Outrageous and willfully false accusa
tions of my opponents" and investigate
them. ' â¢Â¦? Â«'
As the result of the charges made
against Attorney George D.. Collins by
Attorneys Thomas F. Barry and George

Mr. Garnett is the son of a wealthy
grain grower of Glenn County and his
bride is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J.
W. Ammand, formerly of Berkeley.
BERKELEY, March' 29.â Hugh M.
Garnett of the class of '03, University
of California, married Miss Emma
Ammand in Portland three weeks ago
and nobody knew anything about it
until a few weeks ago, when the news
leaked -out through a casual remark
dropped by one of the interested
parties.
It seems that the bride met Mr.
Garnett soon after his arrival in Port
land, where he went after his gradua
tion to take a position, and from that
acquaintance grew an engagement.
The young people kept the engage
ment a secret and when they "married
they kept that a secret, too. Now that
the news is out and all parental objec
tion overcome it is announced that Mr.
and Mrs. Garnett will reside in Port

COLLEGE MAN SURPRISES
FRIENDS BY MARRYING
This overt act on the part of the
sophomores is more than likely to
end in another attempt at rushing:
It amounts to a challenge to the
"freshles" to knock the chip off the
"sophs' " shoulders, and hostilities
may be precipitated at any moment.
In anticipation of such a thing. Pro
fessor Cory has trimmed the wick of
his peering searchlight and picketed
a guard around the hill. With the
dawn may come a list of dead, dying,
wounded and prisoners.
That '07 was as a red rag to a mad
bull to the sophomores, the traditional
enemies of the freshmen, and a band
of them charged up the hill. In a lit
tle while, there being no opposition,
the sophomores had changed the '07
into '06, life size. When the shades of
night lowered over the campus this
evening the '06 was still there.
BERKELEY. March 29.â"Resolv
ing" and "whereasing" seems to have
resulted in some satisfaction to the
juniors at the' University of California,
for when -Professor CJ L. Cory, chair
man of the students' affairs commit
tee, arrived at his office this morning
and found the' set of resolutions
adopted by the claps vesterday, he
immediately made up his mind to re
turn all the jewelry and letters and
key rings that his imported policemen
took from the would-be rushers last
Charter day eve.
Professor Cory called the six or eight
recalcitrants before him, and, after
reading them a lecture, gave them
back their property. This was emi
nently pleasing to the students, and
they are all so glad that they were not
"fired" . forthwith - that they couldn't
kow-tow enough to' the professor. Now
the account' is square again.
There is a promise of more- trouble,
however, in the developments of the
day. For on its way across the campus
this morning the college population
discovered some numerals on the for
bidden Charter Hill. They were the
figures '07 in big white letters of lime,
visible from every point in Berkeley.
The freshmen class had planted them
there in the night.
Edward K. Clarke, the capitalist,
who is suing for the annulment of his
marriage to Rosalind H. Bower-Clarke,
the "sweet pea girl," yesterday filed an
answer to her cross-complaint. He
denies that there is any truth in her
charged and avers that her general
reputation during the last five yeara

The action is brought by Mary
Tobin, v ho states that in IS 93 she and
Tobin held up their right hands and
ewore they would take other for
better or for worse. The formality of
a wedding ceremony was dispensed
with, but this was in the days of con
tract marriages. They afterward lived
together for a period of eight years
and passed as husband and wife and it
is urged that this made the marriage
a legal one.
About a yea* or so ago Tobin's fancy
Ftrayed. He left his partner, and some
time afterward married a second time;
then the first Mrs. Tobin began her
action and asks for a division of the
community property, which she al
leges amounts to about $2000 cash.

The aid of orchardists of the State is
solicited by the College of Agriculture
in the study of the moth, by making
observations in their own localities of
the facts upon which the timing of the
applications in each of these cam
paigns must be based.
"In the lower portion of the Pajaro
Valley the danger of poisoning the fo
liage is so great, even when the maxi
mum of lime is added, that we cannot
recommend the use of paris green at
all, but suggest the substitution of the
lime orjead arsenite."
When and how to spray are questions
which Professor Woodworth says must
be answered by the orchardist himself.
California is of such diversified climate
that no precise rule ttill obtain in any
two parts of \the State at the same
time. Every part requfres a different
kind of campaign, differently timed
and differently executed. Here is what
Professor Woodworth says:
AH the spraying operations should be made
to dcoend upon data, determined for each
region as to certain essential facts In regard
t;j the history of the codlinc moth and of
the tree?. These facts are not difficult to ob
tain and there is no reason why any grower
of eprles might not make the necessary ob
servations to determine the proper time for
these sprayinc operations. ;^'K Â¦
Under tfct worst conditions ttaere will be
the necessity of making three campaigns each
sf-a?on acair.5t the Insect. In many regions
one or tvso of these might be omitted. How
raufh may be omitted will have to be de
termined by the conditions and the locality.
The firrt campaign is intended for the pcison-
Ins of the calyx cup of the apple and re
quires spraying from above and more than
':Â¦,.' application, if the blossoms are not uni
form in time of opening. The second cam
psign is timed by the appearance of the moth
in the spring and requires a method of spray-
Ing different from that of the first cam
paign, the idea being to cover every part
ef the leaf and fruit with poison. The third
campaign is for the . later worms and the
times of beginning and closing this attack
are determined by the production of pupae,
from which moths will hatch that season, and
lay eggs for another brood of worms. The
danger to foliage by poison Is greatest during
this period-
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, March 29.
Full directions for destroying the
codling moth, the enemy of the apple
trees of California, are contained in a
bulletin issued at the University of
California to-day by Professor C. "W.
Woodworth of the entomological de
partment of the College of Agriculture.
Professor Woodworth directed the war
with sprays against the tenacious lit
tle insect all of last season in the Pa
jaro Valley and is therefore qualified
to tell the orchardists of the State the
way out of loss and ruin.
The campaign demonstrated to Pro
fessor Woodworth one thing and that Is
that arsenical sprays are the only real
remedy for the codling moth. There
fore he lays considerable stress on this
point in his bulletin. Of all the* many
suggestions that have been made for
controlling the insect, none but the
arsenical sprays have yielded any re
sults ,worth mentioning. The others
have been tried and found wanting.
His advice to the orchardist is that he
not attempt to experiment with any
thing else, unless it be on a small scale.
Paris green. Professor Woodworth
finds, is the most effective arsenite in
dealing with the moth. It is trae that
there* are some places where paris
green is likely to injure the tree, an
injury that might result in greater loss
than any that the moth might inflict,
and even affect the crop of the follow
ing year. But in most of these regions
the danger of injury can be avoided by
the addition of lime. On this point Pro
fessor Woodworth says:
'"The amount added to the spraying
mixture should be the greater the more
susceptible the trees are to injury. The
regions in which the trees are most lia
ble to injury are those where dews and
fogs are most prevalent. Five or ten
times as much lime as paris green is
the proportion recommended in the
most moist regions. The amount of
paris green commonly used and found
very satisfactory is one pound for 150
gallons.
Policeman John P. Scanlan waÂ» ar
rested to-day on a charge of battery
preferred against him by John J. Mul
vey, a crippled newsboy, and a com
plaint has also been lodged against
the patrolman with the Police Commis
sioners, charging Scanlan with conduct
unbecoming a peace officer. The po
liceman and Mulvey quarreled over a
bet made on the Britt-Ccrrbett flght,
which Scanlan won. Mulvey was not
on hand with his money the next day
and it is charged that he was accused
by Scanlan of "welching." and that
when this was denied it angered the
officer and he attacked Mulvey and
kicked him, injuring him to such an
extent that he had to take to his bed.
When arrested on the battery charge
Scanlan put up $30 bail and was given
his liberty. 'Â¦Â¦'.'.
Mulvey says he has several eyewit
nesses to the treatment he received.
He claims he would have had his money
on hand if Scanlan had given him a
little time. He had bet $30 on Corbett
against Scanlan's $19 oo Britt.

During the morning session of the
institute a short address was delivered
by President David Starr Jordan of
Stanford University on "The Broad
Mind." Addresses were also delivered
by J. W. McClymonds, S. D. Water
man, F. T. Moore, D. R. Angsberg and
Dr. Sarah Shuey. Just before ,the
noon recess the following committee on
resolutions was appointed:
Perhaps thÂ» most important work under
taken by the government of the Philippines
Is that designed to provide for the Filipinos
an opportunity to learn the Knglish langua?p,
the knowledge of which it is proposed to con
vey with a distinctly practical purpose in
view. The Spanish policy of preventing the
Filipinos In many Instances from learning the
Spanish language and of looking v.ith distinct
disapproval upon the use of this language by
the natives is a policy Fometlmes pursued to
make a subject peoplft feel Its subordination.
One of the practical advantages of a. knowl
edge of the English language for the â¢ people
of the Philippine Islands la that It will supply
a common medium of communication where no
such medium formerly existed, and in view of
what has already been achieved .the task of
giving the educated part of the people the
practical use of a new language appears new
much less difficult than at first. It is as
practicable as teaching a community the use
of new tools.
It is our educational policy that gives us a
chance of distinction, and it might be
said that on it hangs the justification of our
control of the Philippines. But If we turn
this business over to politicians of the ordinary
sort, with their indifference to the school
teacher and the cultivation he represents, we
shall be likely to lose the distinctive feature of
the administration that has been established,
with very little chance of showing in any
other direction a superiority the world will ap
plaud.
PURPOSE IX VIEW.
The government of the Philippine Islands
haÂ». therefore, aimed to impart such knowl
edge as would put. the Filipino in touch with
the practical ideas and- affairs of modern civil
ization. It has believed, moreover, that this
might be done without educating him dut of
his race, for the Japanese have found a thor
ough adoption of Western arts and sciences
and Western practical methods quite consist
ent with an uncompromising retention of their
race spirit. They have not lost their essential
characteristics because they build steamships
and railroads and no longer commit hari-kari,
â¢nd there Is much In Japanese history to sup
port the idea, that the Philippines may be led
to accept many of the arts and practical
methods of the West, while still retaining
many of the distinctive qualities of their race.
The educational policy of the Government
of the Philippine Islands differs from that fol
lowed by any other Ruropean nation in Its
Oriental dependencies, and this is and must
continue to be the distinguishing feature of
American administration of dependencies.
Without It. It might be difficult to show
wherein our government of these dependencies
Is likely to be superior to that of other na
tions.
The work undertaken by the Government In
the Philippines involves the problem of one
people educating the members of another, and
an alien race, whose thoughts are not our
thoughts, and whose motives in conduct It Is
not always easy for us to understand. There
fcre at the foundation of our educational ad
ministration In the Philippine* He the facts
of racial distinction and the question of the
relation of one race to another.
The professor said In part:
The system of education Introduced
by the United States Government in
the Philippine Islands was explained
this afternoon by Professor Bernard
Moses, under whose direction the sys
tem was inaugurated In the islands, in
a lecture before the Alameda County
Teachers' Institute at Hamilton Hall.
The topic of Professor Moses* address
was "The Establishment of Public
Schools In the Philippines," and in his
introductory remarks the professor
outlined the history of the laws passed
regarding the establishment of schools
in the islands, and the division of the
archipelago into the â¢ present school
divisions, thirty-six In number, all ex
cept four of which are under the di
rection of a regular division superin
tendent. These superintendents are
under a general superintendent ap
pointed by the Government, who is
authorized to keep in the service of
the insular Government a force of one
thousand trained teachers for the
primary schools. In addition to these
there are a number of teachers in the
employ of the various municipalities.
Professor Moses pointed out that the
work undertaken by the Government
through the Department of Public In
struction was new to Americans, and
was in. some respects different from
the course pursued by other nations In
carrying out their colonial policies.

MIXER OF IXYO DIES
SCDDEXL.Y IN" A HOTEL,
Mrs. Dunning, but the attempt was a t
failure.
Dr. W. G. Wilson followed to testify ;
that Mrs. W. W. Barnes, who, as Mrs. !
Price, was landlady in 1S98 of the Vic- 4
toria Hotel, was ill in bed and unable {
to answer a subpena. It may become 1
necessary to hold a session of the trial 1
at her bedside in order, to secure her |
testimony.
j Then came Kytka with his photo
graphic enlargements of writings, ad
mitted and contested, and the fun be
gan. In addition to the large screen j
was a smaller one bearing enlarge- |
ments of the note inclosed in the can- '
dy box, reading, "With love to your- j
self and baby, Mrs. C." and an admit- j
tedly genuine exemplar of Mrs. Bol- j
kin's handwriting with the words,
"Would that I could see you, my love." i
Knight fought exceedingly hard to
have these enlargements ruled out of
court and was unwilling that they be
put to the use of illustrating what the
handwriting expert wished to ex
plain.
MAKES FUTFLE PROTEST.
"There is no reason." he protested,
; "why this courtroom should be turned
into a photograph gallery for the pur
pose of illustrating something that is
not and never can be in evidence."
During the discussion over the ad*
missibility of the photographs Knight
referred to Byington as "Lady Bying-:
ton," but the District Attorney ignored
the taunt and thus avoided a spat.
Judge Cook finally ruled that the pho
tographs might*be used for illustration
and Kytka continued his testimony.
He said that he had made photo
graphic enlargements of all the writings
in the case and examined them micro
scopically. He identified the wrapper
on the box of candy as the one sub
mitted to him previous to the first
triel. All the other writings were
shown to him in turn and he rum
maged among the luggage he had
brought with him and found the cor
responding photographs and negatives.
In producing them he incurred Knight's
anger, who claimed^ that "by a simple
twist of the wrist" -the witness was
exposing the photographs to the jury.
The court said that was improper and
warned the witness.
Under questions from the District
Attorney, Kytka explained the en
largements on the screen of the fifty
six exemplars of defendant's hand
writing and the corresponding selec
tions from the disputed writings. His
testimony was full of technical ex
pressions. "Hooks," "loops," "termin
als," "character," "construction," "in
itial point," and various other phrases
flowed from him freely and , he traced
I the resemblances with his pointer.
More damaging to the defendant than
the expert's explanation was the view
the Jury had of the enlargements,
which showed to a" startling degree a
similarity between Mrs. Botkin's ad
mitted handwriting and the penman
ship of the note in the candy box and
the address on the wrapper.
When Kytka was asked to point out
the similarity of the handwriting on
the wrapper of the candy box and that
of the two anonymous letters he said it
was so evident that to explain it Would
be a waste of time and he passed the
two over to the jury.
CROSS-EXAMIN'ATION*.
Knight took the expert in hand for
cross-examination about 3 o'clock in
"Did you not call on Sam Short
ridge and offer your services in the
Dillard case and when they were re-
Another storm broke. Byington
objected and Knight said he would
prove the substitution by Oscar Tolle,
formerly clerk in Judge Cook's court.
Kytka was. shouting "He's crazy, crazy,
crazy," and showing in pantomime
with his hands what he thought about
the brain matter concealed under
Knight's scanty, gray hair. The Judge
warned him that he would fine him
for contempt if he made any similar
comments.
At one stage of the examination
Knight asked that Kytka be disquali
fied because he was evidently unfair.
Judge Cook dismissed the motion con
temptuously. Kytka was asked if he
ever solicited employment from attor
neys and if he was not willing to take
any side of a case provided he got a
fee.. He answered in the negative.
"As a matter of fact did you not
substitute for some of the genuine ex
hibits others of your own manufac
ture?"
"Xo. sir." yelled the witness.
THE STOHM BREAKS.
"Xo, sir." said Kytka, "I never
prosecute or persecute anybody."
The witness was asked if he had
ever secured some of the exhibits and
answered that he had by an order of
the court and with Knight's permis
sion*. Â«
not been hired by the police to prose
cute the case.
"Isn't it a fact that the jury ac
quitted him on twenty-nine counts on
which you testified that he committed
fc-rgery and only convicted him on one
charge, and with that you had nothing
to do?"
The witness started to explain, and
Knight demanded an answer, "yes" or
"no." Byington interposed with an ob
jection, and'judge Cook ruled that the
matter was not relevant.
"Were you an expert in the James
E. Davis case?" asked Knight.
"I was your expert," said the wit
ness.
"Were you right 'or wrong in that"
case?"
"I was right, and nobody knows it
better than you."
"I don't know anything of the kind,"
snapped Knight. "Were you a witness
in the Piper will contest and didn't
you pronounce the will a forgery?"
"I did. It was a rank forgery."
"And Chief Lees came to you with
the inkjgtill wet on the will?"
OBJECTION" INTERPOSED.
An objection was interposed, which
relieved the witness from answering
the question.
"You were a witness In the Becker
case, weren't you?" asked Knight.
"I was and he went across the bay
and broke rock."
. "Well, didn't you testify that he had
painted in the body of the check with
a brush?" ; â¢
Again Byington interposed an objec
tion, and then the storm broke.
"I want to show," roared Knight,
"that this man is unqualified as an
expert. Why, everybody knows that
in the Becker case he made a monkey
of himself and was the laughing stock
of the community."
''On the contrary,"' shouted Assistant
District Attorney Ferral, "Becker con
fessed that he did paint in the body of
the check."
Kytka was talking at the same time,
and Judge Cook, red ] and angry. - was
endeavoring to get a hearing. Finally
he succeeded.
"Mr. Knight," he . said, "this thing
has gone far enough. If you make any
more, of these kind of remarks I'll send
you to jail."
During the hush succeeding this dec
laration Knight arose to his feet and
asked. on what grounds he had' been
threatened with imprisonment.
"Because the remarks you make are
entirely improper," - said the Judge.
"Then why allow the District Attor
ney to : make them?"
"He is at- fault also, and I'll send
you both to jail on a repetition of the
offense.". .
Knight asked-the witness if - he had
the afternoon and the audience was
given three-quarters of an hour res
pite from the ennui into which the
dry routine of testimony had plunged
it. Knight"-began-suavely-by inquir
ing how Kytka went about his. Work
when a specimen of handwriting was
submitted to him to be examined as
to genuineness. The witness explain
ed that he picked out all the points
in the case, weighed them one against
another and then came to a conclusion.
"In all the examinations you made
of these writings in this case." asked
Knight, "did you find a single point
in favor of Mrs. Botkin?"
"At first I did," was the answer. "I
found ten or fifteen, but on examining
the writing further I discovered that
these points were the result of an
attempt at disguising her handwriting
and that the genuineness of it was un
doubted."
"Were you an expert in the Dillard
case?C
"I was, and he was convicted."
"On your testimony?"
"Yes."

This property, with other parcels,
was purchased forty-five years ago by

the Fraser River excitement the broth
ers retired to England and have never
visited San Francisco since. One of
the members of A. J. Rich &
Co. visited England last year and
succeeded in inducing them to
part with one of their hold
ings for .eighty odd thousand dol
lars, purchasing the same for Simon
Clayburgh. It is a small piece 20
feet by 100 feet, on the south side of
Geary street and adjoining the build
ing now ocjeupied by S. & G. Gump. It
was at that meeting in England that
these negotiations were started for the
Kearny-street holding. The same firm
only a few months ago were the agents
wben the Stolle brothers, who like
wise held their Kearny-street holding
for thirty-five years, sold their forty
six feet by eighty to Frank Maskey
for $250,000.
Easton. Eldridge & Co.. at their
regular auction, which was held yes

LARGE DEAL. EFFECTED
FOR CENTRAL PROPERTY
During Kytka's direct and cross
examination Mrs. Botkin was worked
up to a highly nervo.us state and fre
quently her emotion found vent in
rapid speech with her attorneys. She
watched the elaborate tracings of the
expert anxiously as he pointed out the
similarity between her own writing
and that of the disputed instruments
and was evidently relieved when his
examination was concluded.
Daniel T. Ames, another handwrit
ing expert, was the last witness of the
day. His testimony was practically a
repetition of Kytka's. delivered in a
less interesting fashion and without
the exciting features of the proceeding
witness. He will be cross-examined
this morning.
jected sell yourself to the other side?"
".\o, sir; that's a lie," protested the
witness.
"Even If Shortridge says it so?"
"I don't care who says it's so; it's
a lie."
Dunning testified that. Mrs. Corbally
came to live with himself and wife on
California street at his wife's invita
tion and that the two women were
close friends. Knight tried to draw the
inference that Mrs. Corbally's interest
in Dunning might have prompted her
to send the box of poisoned candy to
"Never," said Dunning.
After Hosmer had finished Attorney
Knight startled everybody by calling
for John P. Dunning, whom he wished
to examine further. Dunning appeared
in court in his usual nonchalant man
ner and was questioned closely in re
gard to his relations to Mrs. Corbally,
from whom he had testified he bor
rowed $SGO at one time. He said he had
often accompanied her to the Palace
baths and had drunk with her in cafes.
Knight wanted to know what kind of a
bathing suit Mrs. Corbally wore and
whether the swims were taken In day
time or at night. It developed that the
bathing suit was of the regulation
style and that swims -were indulged in
both day and night. Dunning admitted
that he sometimes paid Corbally's life
insurance premium, generally with
money given him by, Mrs. Corbally. "
"Did you ever pay it with money
given you by Mrs. Botkin?" asked
Knight ~ \
John A. Hosmer, who, in' 1898, was
Assistant District Attorney and took a
leading part in the conduct of the first
Botkin trial, was the first witness
called. He was asked in regard to the
so-called "Budd" and "Price" letters
and some signatures on money orders
cashed by Mrs. Botkin, and he testified
that at the first hearing of the case
Attorney Knight, on behalf of his cli
ent, had admitted these to be in her
handwriting.
Attorney McGowan bitterly fought
the admission of this .testimony, main
taining that no admission of Knight's
prejudiciaUto the interests f of the de
fendant could be used against her.
Judge Cook took an opposite view and
on the testimony of Hosnaer admitted
the writings in evidence as exemplars
of -defendant's handwriting. The
"Budd" letter is one written to Gov
ernor Budd by Mrs. Botkin asking for
assignment as a nurse with the troops
going to the Philippines, and the
"Price" â¢ letter is one written from
Healdsburg by the defendant to" the
landlady of the Victoria Hotel in this
city.
KXIGHT STARTLES CROWD.
Kytka's cross-examination was one of
the diverting features of the trial. Dur
ing it there were frequent passages
between the witness and Attorney
Knight, and when these reached a cli
max and Assistant District Attorney
Ferral attempted to sit in the game.
Judge Cook lost his temper altogether
and threatened to send both attorneys
to jail and to impose a fine for con
tempt on the" witness. This threat
brought quiet for a little while, but the
trouble broke out in spots all during
the cross-examination of the hand
writing expert.
"The usual demand for admittance to
the proceedings kept four policemen
busy regulating the crowd and pre
venting the courtroom from becoming
insufferably crowded. During the after
noon session one woman fainted and
was carried out by a policeman. She
was revived in the corridor with some
difficulty and went home. She gave her
name as Mrs. Evans and her address as
408 Stockton street. â¢
To illustrate the ground upon which
he based his opinion, Kytka had taken
fifty-six exemplars of admittedly genu
ine Botkin chirography and enlarged
them photographically. Beneath these
he placed similar letters or words from
the disputed writings and exhibited
them on a screen about fourteen feet
tall and six feet wide. With a broken
horsev.hip for a pointer he showed the
jury the similitude between the ex
emplars and the disputed writing in
the formation of the letters, the
spacing, divisions between certain let
ters and other characteristic marks
that gave him the basis for his opinion.
The enlarged photographs were al
lowed for the purpose of illustration
only, after a vigorous objection by At
torney Knight on behalf of the defense,
and Judge Cook cautioned the jury that
they were not to be .i^garded as evi
dence in anv way.
DIVERTING FEATURE.
In connection with other circum
stantial evidence that connects the de
fendant with the crime are the address
on the wrapper of the box of bonbons,
a note contained in it and two anony
mous letters written to Mrs. Dunning
telling her of the relations existing be
tween her husband and Mrs.Â« Botkin.
Exemplars of Mrs. Botkin's hand
writing which are admitted to be genu
ine have been introduced in evidence
and Theodore Kytka, the handwriting
expert, has made an exhaustive analy
sis and comparison of the various
specimens of handwriting. He was on
the stand yesterday and gave it as his
unqualified opinion that the hand that
penned the address of Mrs. John P.
Dunning on the wrapper of the bcx of
candy, that wrote the note contained
in the box and that indited the two
anonymous letters was the same that
wrote the '"Budd" and "Price" letters,
so called, which are admittedly the
genuine handwriting of Mrs. Cordelia
Botkin.
The biggest gun of the prosecution
was fired yesterday in the retrial of
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin for the murder of
Mrs. John P. Dunning in August, 1S9S.
Mrs. Dunning and her sister, Mrs.
Joshua D. Deane. died from the effects
of eating poisoned candy, which was
sent to the former at Dover, Delaware,
from this city, and Mrs. Botkin was
accused of having sent the candy for
the purpose of ridding Dunning of his
wife.
Th.* trial of Lieutenant Frederick B.
NÂ»ii5rn. who Is accused of ; duplicating
his fay account*, was resumed before
the court-martial at the Presidio yes
t<-r3ay afternoon at. 2 o'clock.. The time
v Â«.Â« devoted entirely to listening to

and that his relatives were people of
high and honorable standing in the
â¢ <-rnii:unity in -which they lived and
were 'at the same time in affluant cir
cumstances. A strong fight is .being
made bjr his attorneys, David Lewi?
and H. C. Pillsbury, to retain for him
his henor and position in the army.
From the testimony offered it would

there was no criminal act intended;

Lieutenants Leigh Sypher and S. A.

prrved with thÂ«Â» defendant in the Phil
ippines, and both swore that in 'ail their
dealings with him he had been an ex-
Trplary officer. *
Court adjourned at 5 o'clock to con
vene again to-day at l;30 p. m., when
further testimony of' a similar char
acter -will be introduced in the defend
ant's behai"f.
The answer denies that the contract
mentioned gave or pretended to "give
an exclusive right to supply water to
the people of Santa Rosa, and that the
city had no power or authority to make
a contract cenf erring an exclusive priv
ilege. It is averred further that the
complainant violated its contract by
furnishing ' # fetid. disgusting and un
wholesome water," and that the water
had been condemned by the Board of
Health in 1S91 as '"a serious menace to
the lives of the people."
It is recited also that the complain
ant violated its contract by refusing
to- supply water for fire purposes free
of charge to the city. It Is then set
tip that the whole matter In contro
versy was decided in favor of the city
by the Superior Court of Sonoma Coun
ty on May 4, 1S97, and hence the stat
ute of limitations hns run against the
corporation.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday tock under advisement the
suit of the Santa RoSa Water Works
against the city of Santa Rosa. The
complaint was filed on November 1. 1S39,
and it asked that the city be perpet
ually enjoined from operating a munic
ipal system of water works.
The complaint recites that cm Febru
ary *. 1874, the complainant entered
into a contract with the city of Santa
Rosa to supply the Inhabitants with
water for the period of fifty years;
that in pursuance of such contract the
complainant put a system of works in
operation and expended $175,000 there
upon.
It is averred that en April 4, 1S93,
Mayor E. P. Woodward approved an
ordinance authorizing the city to con
struct a rival system of water works
and that the system was inaugurated
later and the inhabitants of Santa Ro?a
were supplied by the city with water
free of all cost to them. The com
plainant avers that by this action of
the municipality the value of complain
ant's property has been greatly dimin
ished and its ability to borrow money
destroyed. It is contended that the
city by becoming a competitor in the
water field has violated its contract
with the complainant, and that the
complainant should not be taxed on
its property fer the purpose of support
in? the rival water works.

Most San Francisco people have bad backs. a
Some suffer severely from backache pains, others have attacks that harass, s
annoy, but seem not serious. Many grievous mistakes come through back a
neglect. The apparent weakness which causes every little strain on the back, m
every cold, every exertion to bring backache pains, is a tell-tale warning from u
the kidneys. The kidneys are overworked, they become congested, and if you "
do not relieve them, urinary disorders follow â Diabetes â Dropsy â Bright's Â¦
Disease. Doan's Kidney Pills not only, cure the backache, but cure the kid- B

"band on each fin^rih in turn, first on
One hand and then on the other, thus
civinpr all the muscles an equal chance
to gain the much desfred strength.
Never let the pupil spend more than
a few moments at a time upon any one
linger, for the exercise, simple as it
snay seem, is the most ("training one I
know of, and the utmost caution must
be observed in Its use. It stands to
reason that the exercise would not be
as effective as it is were this not the
case, but there is.no possible chance
idea, the giving to the world of the
particular message that the composer
had in mind, ehall not be wanting.
There' is always some particular
theme which is to dominate the whole
fugue, while other less important
themes are brought in to make the
work a perfect whole.
A fugue is really to be likened to a
play. For instance, there is the central
and most Important theme (equivalent
to the hero or heroine of the play), next
a secondary theme, and often a third,
taking the places of the lesser charac
ters, while there are innumerable small
passages whose use is merely to hold
the more important passages together
â to effect a change of key, and so on.
these smaller parts bearing a strong
semblance to the unimportant charac
ters who fill the stage and keep the play
going while the hero and heroine
chance to be "off." Looking at a fugue
from this point of view one finds it
much more easy to approach than
when taken as a whole, and evidently
the fugue writers intended their work
to be analyzed, for the principal theme
is always announced, alone, at the very
beginning of the fugue. It enters, so to
speak. 'proclaiming the message of the
entire fugue through a single voice.
As it finishes the first motif, a second
voice takes it up, saying just exactly
what the first voice did, while the latter
goes 00 to a secondary theme.
After this the third part starts In,
and then the fourth, each reiterating
the message of_jhe first voice. The
first voice has meanwhile .gone on from
one lesser theme to ant-ther, being fol
lov/ed invariably by the voices behind
it, as sheep follow one another over a
wall. If the first voice stops for a mo
ment the second voice invariably stops
in exactly the same way, when it
reaches that particular spot in the
thcDae, and the third and fourth voices
observe the same rules. It always
seems the aim of each voice to ex
ploit the principal theme as much as
possible, and as the twistings and turn
ings of the fugue become more and
more involved one becomes conscious
that the principal theme Is always be
ing, upheld by one or another of the
voices until, in the course of the ever
broadening grandeur of the mingled
themes, the fugue Is at' last brought to
a glorious and dignified climax.
If the pupil begins his fugue study
with the "inventions," as I suggested,
he will find it very easy to follow; the
Bo-called "voices" to their legitimate
conclusion, and the way toward the
real fugues will be easily paved.

In Friesland there is a custom that
the news of a birth or death Is an
nounced verbally by a man who calls
at every house in the village for that
purpose. If he brings the news of a
birth he wears white gloves; If of a
death they are black. Some days back
a child was born dead In a Frisian vil
lage. It was necessary that the usual
announcement should be made, but in
what colored gloves? The harbinger
was a man of resource. He went his
rounds wearing one white glove and
one black one.

NEWCHWANG is a Chinese river port on the Liao.
It is one of the ports opened to commerce by our
late treaty with China and to which we sent a
"consul. It is under Chinese jurisdiction, else we could
not make a treaty respecting it. Russia has occupied it,
proclaimed martial law and Cossacks have hauled down
the American flag from the consulate and the residences
of Americans. The same has been done with the British
flag. :
This was done by the order of Viceroy Alexieff and it
is not yet known whether the high-handed proceeding is
indorsed by his Government. When that is known there
will probably be diplomatic exchanges between our
State Department and Count Cassini. The. Count will
dutifully convey the studied misrepresentations of his
Government to ours, and there the matter may rest. The
act is another violation of the neutrality and territory of
China. Meantime General Ma, at the head of a Chinese
army the strength and equipment of which are unknown,
is moving toward North China, and Russia is protesting
at Peking that his presence within Chinese sovereignty
with an armed. force is a violation of neutrality and he
must be ordered to withdraw.
The Western nations may not choose to move in^the
matter. But there is no doubt about what they should
do. They should support China in putting Ma and his
army/ right up to the frontier. It is obvious that Russia
intends to continue her outrages upon China until that
upfortunate empire is compelled to- resist. If, at that
time, Japan have an army in the valley of the Liao above
Newchwang and Ma is north of the Kangan Mountains a
1 junction between the two forces would be unhappy for
Russia. In view of this she desires to occupy any
Chinese position that is strategetic as and when she
pleases, pull down flags, violate treaties and keep the
territory free from the military^ forces of China to which
it belongs.
What she failed to get by the secret treaty into which
she would have forced China had it not been discovered
by Minister. Conger she now takes by brute force and in
brazen defiance of the international rights of the United
States,, and Great -Britain.' Maybe such a course will
win and perhaps it won't. The United States has no de
sire . to be drawn into the controversy, but too many
Cossack attacks on our flag may rouse such resentment
among our people that the Government will go beyond
merely pretending to believe the diplomatic lies of the
legation.

"Bill Brown" is a colored boy about
15 years of age. He is even more col
ored than his name would indicate â
he is coal black. He is a wise youth
is Bill, as is evidenced by the records
of the Juvenile Court.
It appears that some months ago Bill
was arrested' for roaming the streets
at unseemly hours and haled before
the Juvenile Court. Judge Murasky,
on his promise to keep off the streets,
released him, but warned him that his
actions would be watched and ordered
him to appear every Friday and let
the court . know how he was getting
along. For several weeks Bill reported
and his statements that he was "gettin*
along all right, mistah," were verified
by the reports of the probation officer.
One Friday afternoon Bill appeared
as usual, but this time he sat in the
jury box with the boys who- had been
arrested during the week.
"How is this, William?" said Judge
Murasky as the black bby stepped up
to the bench in response to his name.
"I thought you promised . to behave
yourself. I see you are charged with
fighting."
"I couldn't help it, mistah," said BH1
with a sly grin. "I jes' has to fight.
You've been pretty good to me."
"Well, Will," interrupted the court,
"what have I got to do with it?"
"Well, mistah," responded Bill, hang
ing his head, but slyly gazing at the
Judge, "yer sent a white kid to de
Boys' and Girls' Aid the, day yer let
me go. Dat kid got erway, and de
odder night he met me and said you
was no good. Mistah, I jes' had to

Travelers who have returned from
the heart of Africa and the Australa
sian continent tell wonderful stories
of nest building people who inhabit the
wilds of those countries. In the bush
men of Australia we find, perhaps. thÂ«
lowest order of men that is known,
says the Penny Magazine. They are
so primitive that they do- not know
enough to build even the simplest form
of huts for shelter. The nearest they
can approach to it ia to gather a lot of
twigs and grass and, taking them into
a thicket or jungle, build a nest for a
home. The nest is usually built large
enough for the family, and if the lat
ter be^ numerous then the nests are
of a very large size. Sometimes the
foliage above will form a natural cov
erning, but there is never any attempt
at constructing a protection from tha
rain and storms.

To students of the history of political shibboleths the
fact is not without interest that the followers of For
aker in Ohio are known by their opponents as Filipinos.
This seems to indicate that whatever our opinion of the
little fellows of .the South Sea. Islands may be we are
likely some day to be forced in simple fair play to de
fend them against prejudices in the creation of which
they had nothing to do. The conduct of a Foraker par
tisan is a reflection on the Filipino.

"Working dogs are not confined^ to
any particular variety. A*ny dog that is
large and strong may be used, and a
great many different kinds are seen.
When a person comes to Germany ona
of the first things that is sure to im
press him as strange is the sight of a
dog hitched to a wagon with a woman
as his mate. In Leipsic working dogs
are very numerous, and are mostly
owned by the poor people. So far as I
have seen, the dogs are treated with
consideration by their owners and
seem, in many cases, really to enjoy
their w6rk."
T â r
the three classes. Dogs of the flrjt
class are taxed 20 mark3 (?4 76). those
of the second class 10 marks ($2 33).
and those of the third class only *
marks ($1 19) per annum.
The variety of dog which seems tÂ»
be the most fancied as a pet 1ft Ger
many i3 the short-legged, elongated
dachshund.
"The dogs that are used for hunting
are mostly German deerhound* ami
bird- dogs of the setter and pointer
types. Beagles are seldom used an4
are uncommon. Hunting dogs, aa a
rule, are kept in the country, and very
little is seen of them.
But McKinley stood to his guns, and in the center of a
hollow square formed out of the old guard of his party
refused to surrender. In 1896 he went into the Presi
dency with not a policy recanted nor an act apologized
for. Now, according to Champing Clark, he is fellow-
shiped by those who opposed him and to have been
logical that year they should have supported him in
stead of Bryan.
Clark declares now that there are no Democratic free
traders. They are all for tariff. But what sort of issue
does that make? We appear then to have two parties,
both supporters of the same thing. If the Democrats
make it a question of degree instead of kind, they may
decline upon a revenue tariff. Such a tariff-requires the
high taxation , of what we don't produce, such as tea,
coffee and some few fibers and fabrics. In the fiscal year
1 902^. we derived from tariff taxation $254,444,708 and
from internal revenue $271,880,122. Our total revenue
was $684,326,280 and our total expenditure was $593,038,
903. To be sure there was a surplus, but it is about to
be made useful in building the Panama canal.
Does Mr. Clark propose to get all that tariff revenue
out of the few articles -we don't produce, very few in
number and all susceptible of being substituted? When
ever we have had a tax on tea and coffee the people have
used something else. The high tax that would make
those articles produce the revenue yielded by the Ding
ley bill would at once materially disuse them. The Mc-
Kinley tariff of 1890 was planned to yield revenue and
promote the domestic manufacture of tin, sugar, buttons
and many other things which furnished use for our raw
material, employed labor and made us independent of
other countries.-
Mr. Clark should submit, a .bill' of particulars and cir
cumnavigate his tariff so that the' people will know just
what it meansj Democratic denunciation of the Mc-
Kinley tariff of 1890 elected. Mr. Cleveland in 1892, but
when his party tried to make a tariff it was a nonde
script which he refused to sign and denounced in a spe
cial message as "a record of perfidy and dishonor." We
venture to inform Mr. Clark that the people do not want
any more perfidy-and-dishonor tariffs. Protection is
good enough.
It is not a far cry to 1890,- the year of the McKinley
tariff, which the Democrats attacked like \ Cossacks
swooping on a Chinese village. It was denounced as the
sum of all economic villainies, and, denouncing it, the
Democrats elected the largest majority in the House
that any party has had since the Civil War. The banner
of free trade was flung jocund to the breeze and impas
sioned oratory followed the sunrise across the continent
from ocean to ocean, and then got uo and took a drink
next morning in Maine and renewed the chase.'
Republicans may well pinch themselves and ask with
Congressman Cobb, "Where was I at?" Some one ought
to put a padlock on Dingley's record, or some hot after
noon in the House the Democrats will wave it in the dim
religious light that shines through the smoked glass
ceiling and claim him as an exponent of their time-hon
ored principles.
Buchanan, Jerry Black, Lewis Cass, Toombs, Yancey,
Wigfall, Governor Seymour, Hendricks, Bill Allen, Thur
man, and the long list of Democratic leaders contem
porary, with him looked upon him as the enemy of the
country and the destroyer of the If the
Democracy of to-day adopt him they must adopt also his
supporters, and point with pride to those great and wise
promoters of the principles of Jefferson and Jackson:
Sumner, Lovejoy, Thad Stevens, Joshua R. Giddings,
John G. Birney, Gerritt Smith, John Brown of Osawat
omie, Wendell Phillips, Senator Doolittle and Jim Lane.
Mr. Champ Clark is not to be outdone by Mr. Hearst
in claiming dead Republicans as the exponents of living
Democratic. principles, and so in his issue-making speech
he lifted McKinley right off his seat in history as a Re
publican leader and sat him down on the Democratic
side of the tariff question! '
THE House has had another free-for-all day. True,
the business on hand was the sundry civil appro
priation bili, but the members discussed lynchings,
,the negro question and the tariff. After many spats and
speeches Mr. Champ Clark of Missouri rose to engage in
the manufacture of .an issue for the campaign. He se
lected the tariff and when he finished that venerable and
time-tried question was put out and laid in its corner
while the referee counted ten. One thing in all this
Democratic search for something to use in the cam
paign is interesting, in Mr. Hearst's platform is this
statement: "Believing in the principles of government
expressed by Thomas Jefferson, applied with matchless
courage by Andrew Jackson and nobly supported by
Abraham Lincoln."
Lincoln has been dead thirty-nine years, and is now
adopted as one of the saints in the Democratic calendar!
In his lifetime he opposed everything for which Democ
racy stood, from the time he entered politics as a mem
ber of the Illinois Legislature until the night he was shot
by Wilkes Booth. He opposed slavery; fought the Le
compton constitution, the fugitive slave law, secession,'
free trade and every other Democratic policy. He was
the founder of the national bank system and the second
founder of the Union, and in every measure and princi
ple of government for which he stood was fought tooth
and claw by the Democracy of his day. .
The time has now come to bring up
the subject of fugues. To the un
initiated a fugue, unless it be marvel
ously well played (and even then, in a
majority of cases) is utterly without
meaning, melody or music. Even to
the mildly musical mind, a fugue seems
to have little excuse for being and if
a person who claims to be only "rather
musical" really enjoys hearing a fugue,
he doesn't know exactly why he likes it.
In order to thoroughly enjoy a fugue,
one must study the fugue-form, and
find out what it is all about
The easiest way to do this, is by
studying the "inventions" of Bach, as
I stated in a former lesson. They are
divided into what Bach called "two
voiced" and "three-voiced" inventions,
and the principal difference between
them and a fugue lies in the fact that
a fugue, generally speaking, has four
'"voices," in other words, four parts,
which makes it proportionately more
involved than the "two-voiced" or
"three-voiced" creations. ,
In the old days, the great masters
had something to say, and they did not
hesitate to say it in firm, emphatic lan
guage â and the more voices they could
say it in, and the more times they
could make each voice repeat it, the
better they liked it.
The pupil must bear this in mind,
and in learning to render a fugue in
telligently, must try tÂ«j bring each voice

After practicing this exercise_ihe boy
must always finish by relaxing mo
tions for the fingers, wrist and arm.
Do not let him forget this, even once.
It should be done naturally, as if it
were a part of the exercise, for I can
not speak too strongly of the neces
sity of careful and conscientious re
laxatic-n after all straining work. The
strain, the sensation of effort, must
not be left in the fingersâ there must
be instead a feeling of wholesome re
lief and relaxation if the muscles are
to be strengthened and invigorated in
stead of worn out. This rule should
apply invariably to every sort of music
study, whether vocal or instrumental.
Do not fail to- realize its importance, I
beg of you, and see that the pupil thor
oughly understands it. 0
In practicing the lateral form the
student Â¦ should try the exercise first
with one pair of fingers, then with an
other, changing the grc-uping in every
possible way. For instance, after tak
ing the fingers as -they naturally come
(first finger and second, second and
third, third and fourth, fourth and
fifth), he should try the first and third
together, then the second and fourth,
then the third and fifth. After this let
him try the first and fourth, then,sec
ond and fifth, and finally the first and
fifth.
of any harm coming to the pupil
through its use if my directions 'are

him away to the point of rashness in
the matter. He should stop work the
moment his fingers become tired, no
matter how interested he may be.
ISSUE MAKING.
Every old Stanford man will tell
this story, but for those who know no
Stanford men It will have a refreshing
ly humorous appeal.
In the old days when Brlstow
Adams, Charlie Field and Bill Irwin
were livening the prosaic atmosphere
down at. Dr. Jordan's school it hap
pened that there came to the college
a freshman from the city who had
more money than wisdom and whose
dearest desire was to become a mem
ber of one of the students' fraternities.
He did not hesitate to voice his wishes
to fraternity men, a rank breach of
college etiquette.
So it was that a dozen or more of
the jokers got together and sent a bid
to^he freshman to join their fraternity,
which they said was one of the strong
est in the East, but which was carry
ing on a temporary sub rosa existence
at Stanford. They said that he was to
appear at a certain lonely spot in tho
arboretum at a late hour of the night
with a bus of sufficient dimensions to
carry all the loyal brothers to May
field, where the initiation services were
to be held. He was there with the
bus and to Mayfield some twenty odd
of the mystic circle hied themselves.
The initiation, which was drawn from
the Koran, Josephus, the Talmud and
half a dozen other sources, was a
noble one. Likewise the "feed"
which followed â paid for, by the way,
by the novitiate.
In the height of the fun Bill Irwin
arose and with great dignity read a
letter from one of the prominent mem
bers Qf the faculty, regretting that he
was unable to be present at the festivi
ties, but hoping that the newly initi
ated brother would not be long In
coming to him and making himself
known. After the reading of" the let
ter the neophyte was told that out of
due courtesy he should call on Pro
fessor Blank the very next morning.
Remember to give him the password,
"It is cloudy in the south to-night,"
and the sign â left forefinger to the
side of the nose.
Down at Stanford they still tell of
the meeting the next day between the
freshman and Professor Blank when
the boy brought his instructor to the
front door from his breakfast table to
look gravely at him over his left fore
finger and tell him that it "was cloudy
in the south to-night."
Cloud v in the South.
number of drownings reported is- three." Reports from
Indiana were to the effect that at Portland two men
were drowned and a property damage of $100,006 caused
by a flood in' that section, while from Indianapolis came
a story of a flood that drove 300 families from their
homes and caused an enormous loss of property. From
Battle Creek, Michi, there was a report of losses from
floods amounting to upward of $300,000. A dispatch from
Springfield, Ohio, says: "The worst flood in Spring
field's history threw a thousand men out of employment,
drove twenty-five families from their homes and com
pletely stopped street car traffic." No estimate of dam
age was given. . Â¦> -
Since Sunday the reports of each succeeding day have
added heavily to the lists' of deaths and losses in the
various States. In Northern and Central Indiana the re
cord up to Monday night showed eight persons drowned
and a property loss estimated at $8,000,000. In Michi
gan 14,000 people are , reported to be in distress because
of the floods, and reports almost as bad come from va
rious points in Ohio and Missouri.
The floods thus reported occurred along comparatively
small streams. .They are but the preliminaries of the
vast floods that will follow when the swollen waters of
these streams unite to swell the greater rivers to flood
height. It is rather early yet for the Eastern flood sea
son to reach its worst, but before long we 'shall hear of
all the rivers from New England to Texas overrunning
their Hanks and carrying destruction to towns and cities
as well as to farm lands.
These heavy floods come to the entire Eastern section
of the country every year. In comparison with them our
worst California floods amount to but a trifle either as
to the area of country flooded or as to the amount of
damage done and lives lost. Taken at its worst Califor
nia is a much better land for either urban or rural life
than any other part of the world. We have our draw
backs, it is tnte, but when we review them' in compari
son with the tremendous disadvantages of other lands
we can find no reason to complain. Be it wet weather or
dry weather, this is the best land oh earth.

Call directed attention to the 'fact that while the
damage would be severely felt by those upon whom it
fell, yet the loss to the State as a whole would be slight,

springtime floods in the Eastern States, almost insigni
ficant. That , statement is verified by reports just ' re

Frank Ballard, alias Alan. Dale, an
ex-convict, was tried before a jury in
Judge Diyine's court 'yesterday on a
charge of robbery. The jury was out
only ten minutes. Ballard held up
Thomas Cronin. an old man, outside
a saloon on Commercial street, near
Kearny, on October 19 and took a
gold watch from him. The prosecu
tion was weakened by the fact that
Cronin had left the city, but his evi
dence taken at the preliminary hear
ing was read. Ballard will be sen
tenced On April 5.
Ballard's convictipn has given the
greatest satisfaction to the Police De
partment, as he was looked upon as
one of the most dangerous crook3 in
the city. He has* been known for
years as a "knockout drops artist"
and about a year ago he escaped con
viction on a charge of having such
drops in his possession, Judge Cook
giving a decision that the ordinance
under which the charge was made was
defective.

The California State Board of Trade
is arranging for a royal excursion of
California merchants, manufacturers
and producers to St. Louis. A special
train will be rHn under the manage
ment af the California State. Board of
Trade. about the middle of May, when
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition will
be well under way.
The expectation is that a large num
ber of representative men of this State
will take the trip, the purpose of which
is to make at St. Louis a demonstra
tion for California and also to afford
an opportunity to journey to and from
and view the exposition attractions un
der the most favorable and agreeable
circumstances possible.
The Board c-f Trade "has selected the
middle of May as tha time for starting
because the weather will then be de
lightful in St Louis and overland travel
will be pleasant. Round trip tickets
will be $67 50 each, first class and ninety,
days' time will be given to return, so
that the party going in a. body may re
turn at leisure individually. Choice of
routes returning is also given without
extra charge.
Secretary L. M. Fletcher of the Cali
fornia State Board of Trade is mak
ing the necessary arrangements, and
reservations should be made with the
board as early as possible. Mr. Fletch
er's long experience as a railroad man!
makes certain that the excursion will
be well handled.
All. the details for the third excur
sion in this State of the California Pro
motion Committee have been arranged.
An extra Pullman car has been ordered
to- be attached to the train at Los An
geles and about twenty-live prominent
men from that place will accompany
the party on the trip to San Pedro,
San Diego, Santa Ana, Riverside, Red
lands and Pasadena, covering two days'
travel. There will be included in the
party representatives from the Sacra
mento Valley Development Association,
the California Central Coast Counties
Improvement Association and the San
Joaquin Valley Commercial Associa
tion.
Holders of tickets may make berth
reservations on presentation of tickets
at the headquarters of the committee,

morning at 9 o'clock. It is particularly
requested that those desiring' to join
the excursion who have not yet regis

CHICAGO, March 29.â A child's testi
mony reversed saved five men to-day
from the gallows. The result was a
striking parallel to the case in which
a fortnight ago Millionaire Peter Van
Vlissinger practically demonstrated
that under police pressure a boy named
Wiltrax had given false testimony,
leading to the conviction of the boy's
father, for murder. i
Â¦To-day's instance c-f j'OUthfuPunre
liability under oath was in the case of
William McCarty and four Polish young
men, on trial far murder, the Â¦witness
being a little girl, Apollinia Starlsta,
who first gave direct, straightforward,
eye-witness testimony, apparently es
tablishing beyond question the guilt
of the men, and then repudiated her
sworn evidence.
In explanation c-f the remarkable
change of front the child declared that
she had been instructed how to testify
by the widow of the murdered man.
Charges against the prisoners were
withdrawn by the State's attorney, the
five men walking Out of' the dock free
by order of the court.

Attorney F. TV. Sawyer filed a pe
tition in the Superior Court yesterday
asking that Frances Noonan; widow of
the late Jeremiah Noonan, explain
why she did not file her husband's

RETIREMENT FROM RACING
The case of J. H. Â¦ Kennedy, who is
on the civil service list in line for ap
pointment as a police officer, occupied
much of the Police Commissioners'
time last* evening.' Kennedy should
have been appointed; last January, but
certain charges were made against
him and he lost his place in line at
that time. The Civil Service Board
found that the charges were false and
the Police Commissioners wish now to
appoint Kennedy, but want the former
board to again certify to his name. This
the civil service people refuse to do,
saying they have already, done so.
The matter will be settled amicably
at the next meeting.
' Policeman Thomas P. Kinch was
fined $50 for not reporting for duty
and Policeman James Gill was found
guilty of being, intoxicated, but will
not be sentenced until next Tuesday
night.

ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
Napa Stock Farm's great filly Arisbe.
winner of the Bell stakes, will meet
Pinkerton again on Saturday In the
Gebhard stakes at Oakland. Barney
thinks that he has a wonder in the
black colt and Trainer Dick Williams
concurs \ in his employer's opinion.
Pinkerton will probably reach Oakland
to-day from Los Angeles. He will be
ridden by Jimmy Boland. Frank Otis
will have the mount on Arisbe. The
weights for the stake will be named
to-day.
Not all the members of the ring quit
loser on the afternoon's proceedings,
for "English Bill" Jackman won $2S0O.
Bookmaker Gus Bluhm, with his
family, will depart shortly for the
"East.
It is stranse that Quiz could not
show first any part of it in the last
i ace. The gelding always liked heavy
going. .
Buxton is busily engaged, it is said,
writing a book entitled "Does it Pay
to RfdÂ« One Good and Two Bad
Races?" . .
With Diderot to all outward appear
ances a member of the has been class,
the mile and seventy-yard number
looked easy for Galanthus. The talent
fell on the Coffey horse with both feet,
forcing the odds down to 7 to 10. Dide
rot showed speed for something over
a quarter of a mile, when the favorite
went to the front, winning without ef
fort at the close from Chickadee.
IrO.U, at" one time hopelessly out of
the running, took third, place from the
weakly ridden Frank Woods.
Buxton's ride on El Piloto in the last
race was a t gorgeous piece, of nonsen
sical horsemanship.. Figured on Green
wich time, "Frisco" Hoag's gelding was
1 year 7 months 29 days 3^ hours 16
minutes the best and thus finished sec
ond. There was some talk of the
race beinga "shoo-in", for Criss Cross,
which 1 , mare closed '. equal , choice with
Oro Viva. Possibly, it was only Â¦ idle
gossip, ' such as is . handed ; around on
tracks every day. At any rate, . Oro
Viva" got away .badly "and Criss- Cross
â¢won" by half a length. from the wretch
edly handled El Pllotcr. ' : <1
. Napa Stock Farm's stake winning
filly Arisbe looked far and away the
best of the five starters in the two
year-old scramble and the liberal price
of 7 to 10 could be had about her. She
had Frank Otis on her back and, catch
ing Sea Air at the paddock, scored
handily by more than a length. Harry
Stover's George P. McNear took show
honors from Inspector Halpln.
Harry Thatcher did not start In the
six and a half furlong run next decided
and Optimo enjoyed first call at odds
of 6 to 5. The gelding was ridden by
Crosswaite and, beating his company
away from the barrier, only galloped
from start to finish.. Sue Johnson tired
perceptibly, as the stand was ap
proached and Vanderbout, on Pencil
Me, secured the place.
GAIiAXTHTJS IS FIRST.
Reeves, the entry of Lamasney Bros.,
looked a legitimate 7 to 10 chance for
the opening event, still the books laid
3 to 2 at the start off. Bonner rode the
bay horse, which won as he pleased.
In a hard drive Mountain landed Edu
cate, a 1Â« to 1 shot, in the place, a neck
before Salto. Colonel Ballantyne made
his first appearance this season and
ran a fair sort of race, even if he col
lected nothing for his owner.
REEVES WINS IIAXDIIjY.
The feature event was the handicap
at six furlongs, for which the Jennings
pair, Letola and Nigrette, had a de
cided call. Sad Sam tried to make
good with his 114 pounds, but Letola,
piloted by Travers, passed him when
ready, and won by four open lengths
from Ocean .Dream, the second choice.
Nigrette finished third and with any
sort of fair handling could have been
second.
Horses are not supposed to run to
their best form over a muddy track,
but this rule was broken on six straight
occasions yesterday at Oakland. Be
ginning with Reeves and ending with
Criss Cross every first choice was led
away to the stable wearing a brand
new set of winning brackets. The regu
lars were out in full force and the
major portion of the bookmakers were
hard hit. J -v?.- ;

LOS ANGELES. March 29.âNotwith
standing the defeat of five out of six
favorites at Ascot to-day, the books
were hard hit. Every winner except
one, Agnes Mack, was at good prices
and was played all over the ring. The
field books especially suffered from the
victory of Geisha Girl, which, after
being played from 40 to 1 to 12 to 1.
won by a nose from Victoria S, the
favorite.
Chemist, at 6 to 1, started the proces
sion by taking the first race from thÂ«
favorite. Liberto, with Little Secret
third. In this race Lurdan was cut
down on the first turn. The hamstring
of his left leg was cut as if severed by
a knife. He was destroyed on the track
where he went down.
Mistletide. played from 10 to 1 to 6
to 1. was the next winner, beating: Eu
genie B a head, with Pat Bulger third.
Geisha Girl took the next by a short
nose, with Victoria S second and the
Covenanter third.
Elie, at 10 to 1. won the fourth at a
mile and a sixteenth, Platonius was
second and Jingler third.
Agnes Mack took the fifth by a nose
and Farmer Jim the last race by a
head from Discus, with Evander third.

Rufe Smith, "lightweight champion
of Colorado," secured the decision over
Young McConnell of the Reliance Club
in the tenth round". Smith, though
eighteen pounds lighter than the Oak
lander, simply played with him. Mc-
Connell must learn not to do his fight
ing on the floor.
Young Dempsey of West Oakland and
Kid Kennedy of the Eureka Club
fought a lively f6ur rounds to a draw.
When the betting opened in this city
yesterday afternoon Turner was in
stalled an 8 to 10 favorite. There was
a heavy play on Cordell early in the
evening and the betting shifted com
pletely around. Cordell went into the
ring a 7 to 10 favorite. It was thought
for a time that the betting had a bad
look, but the result did not. bear this
out.
Â¦ They started oft in the first round
with Turner swinging hard and land
ing a couple of knockdown blows. A|
the opening of the second Cordell
went to the floor under a whirlwind of
swings, and then the white lad began
to lead with his left, using it constant
ly to Rufe's head. Turner missed
swings repeatedly, his blows falling
short. Then the fight settled down to
a continuous performance of left jabs
from Cordell to the negro's nose.
From the fourth to the tenth round
Turner did very little work, occasion
ally making a rush into Cordell, but
failing to do any damage.
Jack appeared to gain confidence
with the progress of the fight, and, if
anything, that cost him a victory on
points. His constant jabbing, how
ever, was not strong enough to more
than keep Turner's nose bleeding.
With the opening bell in the eleventh
Turner jumped in and with a heavy
left put Cordell to the floor. Jack
took George Harding's count of nine
and- was up in time only to go down
again under another terrific jolt.
Turner put in a third as soon as Cor
dell straightened out, and the finish
came with the fourth, a heavy right
straight to the point of the jaw.
BETTIXG IS PANICKY*.
COUJ>KLT, IS DOWN*.
Â¦ * . . .
Rufe Turner, the colored boxer from
Stockton, knocked out Jack Cordell, the
Hayes Valley boy, in the eleventh
round last night at the Reliance Club,
Oakland. Turner's right and left
swings came in one, two, three, four
order at the finish, catching the Hayes
Valley lad clean on the jaw and set
tling a fight that for eight rounds of the
ten before the knockout was Cordell's
on points. The white lad's advantage
in reach gave him the best of the box
ing, and it was when he closed in on
Turner that Rufe landed hfs stiff
swings which settled Cordell's game.
The Hayes Valley contingent was
hopeful for a while that the contest
would go the fifteen rounds, but
Turner, jabbed as ha was, did not in
tend that it should end that way. Just
before he started to the center in the
eleventh he whispered "I'll get him In
this round." Cordetl did his best work
in his straight jabs with the left to the
face. His tries at Turner's body did not
avail. Indeed the finishing blows came
while Cordell was essaying stomach
punches.

In the list of conditions which Ad

was included that they "should treat

Darky Diplomacy.
John Sharh- Williams, the Missis
sippi wit, tells of a Southern friend
whose colored" valet fell in love with
a pair of loud checked trousers which
his master owned. By way of hasten
ing the day when they should be
turned over to him he threw some
grease on them. Then he reported
that he was unable to remove the
spots. . "Have you tried
Sam?" said his master. *
"Yes, sah."
"Have you tried ammonia?"
."No, sah," replied Sam, insinuating
ly. Â¦ "I ain't tried demon me, but
I'm sho* them pants'll fit me good."
Bagging a Cheetah.
Here is a very recent instance of, the
plucky behavior often exhibited by
Indian villagers in dealing with the
great cats with which they sometimes
come into uncomfortable contact. The
"King" states that the brute pranced
upon four villagers who were reaping
paddy near a Ceylon village and
mauled them all pretty severely.
Thereupon the village seems to have
turned out and simply "shoo'd"- the
cheetah until it ran into a hut, out of
which the only occupant, an old wo
man, walked and closed the only door
behind her. Thanks to the splendid
pluck of this admirable female, the
cheetah was easily shot from the. roof.
It stood 3 feet high and measured over
8^ feet. â London Globe.
A Grand Fight.
Mart Sturtevant's bulldog Conser has
been cock of the walk in thia town for
many years. Besides easily vanquish
ing the biggest dogs he has killed seven
porcupines and Is an old customer of
the village blacksmith, who extracts
the quills of infuriated porcupines
which he has fearlessly attacked. Since
the arrival of the Aliens, who also have
a bulldog, Conser has been on his good
behavior. The merits of the two dogs
have been discussed at the corner
grocery, and some of the gamblers have
offered to bet two to one on the Allen
dog, thoufih a much smaller dog than
Conser. Wednesday, however, the two
dogs got tangled up in a fight on Wil
low street, and Ringling Brothers' cir
cus could not have attracted a larger
crowd. Men, women and children
flocked to see the fight. The marshal,
fearing that others might take a hand
in the scrap, made his appearance, and.
after seeing a round or 'two, ordered
the respective owners of the bulldogs
to pull them apart. It was "the best
fight that has taken plr*ce in the town
for a month.â Pilot Rock (Ore.) Rec

COLUSA, March 29. â A break in
the levee occurred at the Boggs-
Davis place, just below Prince
ton, but it would have been stopped
had it noLbeen for the rise in the river
following the rain of Sunday. The levee
went out to-day, and the water is now
coming through a break 700 feet wide
and in some places sixteen feet deep.
Perhaps 20,000 acres of the finest grain
will be lost.
The Howell Point levee connects with
a levee running down the west side of
the basin from Sycamore Slough, just
above College City. At the lower end
of the district the water will come very
nearly up to the river. This district
now has two dredgers at work, and by
another season will have levees so high
and strong that they will be safe under
almost all conditions.
STOCKTON, March 29. â Notwith
standing the heavy rain of yesterday
and continued rains to-day, there is
still no sign of high water here. The
reports sent out by the United States
Weather Bureau yesterday regarding
probable high water caused consider
able alarm here, but with the failure
of the high water to arrive the feeling
of alarm is subsiding.
FRESNO, Mjych 29.â The heaviest
rainfall ever seen In this section of
the country fell this afternoon. In less
than an. hour Weather Observer Bolton
reported .44 of an inch of rain. In
thirty minutes it rained .25 of an inch.
This makes the total rainfall for the
season 6.48 Inches, as compared with
6.70 inches last year. The cry for more
rain has changed to "too much rain."
The streets this afternoon were flooded,
the water rising above the level of the
sidewalks in several places.
SAN JOSE, March 29.â A slight rain
has been falling intermittently all night
and this forenoon. While the rain has
been heavy throughout the greater por
tion of the valley and foothills this
v/inter, the fall in this city has been
comparatively light. The total of 11.53
inches here to date is about half the
quantity that has fallen throughout the
producing areas of the county.
SAN DIEGO, March 29.â Showers
have continued at intervals this after
noon and evening, nearly half an inch
of,rain having fallen in this city dur
ing that period. In the country the
storm is generally heavier.
HOLLISTER, .March 29.â The rain
fall here last night was a half inch,
making 9.65 inches for the season. A
prosperous ! season is'assured. '
Rivers Are Still-. Rising.
Professor McAdie of the Weather
Bureau stated last night that the riv
ers in the northern part of the State
had been rising all day and would
rise gradually until some time to-day.
There is likely to be some rain to-day,
but probably not enough to percepti
bly affect the flooded district.
GALVESTON, Tex.. March 29, â FouÂ»
white men and one negro are dead
and a number of persons are severely
wounded as a result of a race war in
the lumber region, of Eastern Texas.
The dead are:
MARTIN SUROVAK (white), at
Montgomery.
TOBE McKINNEY (white), near
Hooks station.
HENRY BULLOCK (white), at Sils
bee.
FREDERICK HOPPBRT (white), at
Beaumont.
JOHN MAYNARD (colored), at
Montgomery.
The trouble began two or three weeks
ago when the lumber companies of
East Texas began systematically to rid
themselves of shiftless characters. This
was followed by one sypicious fire
after another, incendiarism prevailing
at nearly every mill of note in East
Texas and Western Louisiana.
Among the mills that suffered were
the four belonging to the Hudson River
Lumber Company and the King Rider
Lumber The guards at night
were quadrupled. Later men attempt
ed to fire the mills and were discov
ered by the guards, but made their es
cape. An investigation developed that
rags and other combustible material
saturated with oil had been used.
Later an attempt was made to burn
the town of Soulake, where several
shiftless negroes were discharged from
the oil fields a few days ago. This
was followed in rapid succession by the
lynching of John Maynard (colored) at
Montgomery, who paid with his life the
penalty of having, with two other ne
groes, attacked and robbed several lum
bermen, one of whom, Martin Surovak,
died from the effects of a beating.
The night before last Frederick Hop
pert, a watchman for a lumber mill
at Beaumont, was discovered myste
riously shot. Developments indicate
that he came to his death at the hands
of the negroes. Yesterday Tobe Mc-
Kinney, a white lumberman, was shot
and killed at Hooks station by Bob
Childress and George Odum, ne&roes.
A "retaliatory attack was begun by the
-whites and Childress was wounded. He
is now in jail. Odum cannot t* found.
Last night while Henry Bullock, Sid
Stewart and M. A. McNeil, white, were
returning home at SilsJSee they were
ambushed by a gang of negroes. Bul
lock was shot and killed 'and his com
panions were seriously wounded.
Arms and ammunition were. at once
ordered into East Texas by the whole
sale, hut the bad negroes took warn
ing and fled. Those of the colored race
with known good characters are being
protected, but danger is imminent to
those known to be profligate if they
can be found.

Yesterday was the California Club's
day' to shineâ and it shone with the
light of a rare programme â an after
noon of elysian dreams and of dulcet
musicâ 'twas: Omar Khayyam day.
And the singers? Just ask any of the
800 guests what a rare joy Mrs. John
D. Slbley had prepared for them when
she devised: the plan of telling the tale
of the Persian dreamer to the sob of
exultation of music.
The programme was unfolded in the
auditorium of the Y. W. C. A. build
ing â the clubrooms wouldn't have held
the vanguard of guests, and the rooms
are of no mean proportions. Mrs.
George Law Smith, with her ac
customed grace, announced the fol
lowing entertainment: ; â¢ v

Miss MolHe Pratt at the piano.
As to the tantalizing Lady Teazle,
who, by the way, was smartly frocked
in modern garb, she was an alluring
tease, fascinating in her smart sallies
to the grumpy but adoring old Sir
Peter.
Then the psychological lyre was at
tuned and the mystic songs from the
Persian bard were sung in unforget
table manner, pdward Xavler Rolker
scoring an astounding hit in the solo,
"Ah! That Spring Should Vanish With
the' Rose."
Mrs. Sibley's "But if Soul Can Fling
the Dust Aside" was, by those of us
who decide for ourselves what we like
and what we doji't, pronounced the
gem of her numbers.
Mrs. Elliott and Homer Henley
shared honors in their recitative work,
and the quartet work was a joy â a
rare joy.
Let us hope that another day of like
quality (yes, and quantity, because it
wasn't soggy with weight) shall soon
be given us again. Mrs. Sibley, con
gratulations!
Hark, ye carfl wielders! Likewise
ye of tender spirit! ; The Nursery for
Homeless Children (now think what
that means) wants money and wants
it badly. Its present home on Mission
and Twelfth streets, though a model
of cleanliness and intelligent care, is
sadly inadequate for its needs. A new
home must be secured and it takes
money to get it. Now, listen and learn
how you may help to build that home
and at the same time indulge your pet
predilection, be it bridge or whist or
even plebeian poker, for on April 7 at
Native Sons' Hall a monster card
party will be given, an admission fee
to which will be charged. Tickets are
for sale at the home or by any of the
members of the board of directors.
This money (and -about 2000 guests
are expected) will bring benisons upon
the heads of those that helped. Will
you?
The regrular monthly meeting of the
Association of Pioneer Women of Cal
ifornia will be held in Golden Gate
Hall at 2 p. m. on Friday. April 1.
After the business Vneeting tea will
be served and a social hour will be
enjoyed.

I fÂ°?r^ CALL READERS |
Seven remarkable pictures have been prepared especially for The
Call by its printing house, the American Colortype Company of
New York and Chicago, and one of these pictures will be issued
with The Call every Sunday in the order indicated.
"HIGHLAND SHEEP."
It Is the of a sup*rb painting by one of that world-famous family
of art creators, the Bonheurs. Aurutte Bonbcur is the author of the picture, which
tKjuaif the best work of his even more celebrated tleter. Rosa. This art piece will
bt- pivpn away. free, with each copy of ThÂ« Sunday Call.
August* Bonheur, ln presenting "Highland Sheep" to. the world, made as fine a
contribution to the art pallery of tha age* as <Ud hla illustrious eister. Rosa., when
tiJi^ jiaimed that euperbly colored revelation of animal power and physical beauty.
"The Horee Fair." Both pictures are fÂ»o perfect that they se*m to surpass the
powrr cf mere art. for they possess qualities of realism which actually fool the
eenses.
. Aug-arte's climb into fame waa even more arduous than his 6ister'i". for his very
narae handicapped him. In 18*5. w.-.e n all Paris was tajklng about the remarkable
c xhlbits ln the Salon by a young girl named Rosa Bonheur. who had elected to be-
come a peinter of animals, another Bonheur made an appearance in the galleries.
This time it was a man. Francois August* by name and a man ambitious to be a
raantrr of genre. His pretensions were laughed at. ' It was critically concluded that
the .Bonheur family, taught by the father, could produce only one phenomenon.
But the following year this genre painter exhibited a landscape which at-
tracted attention. In a few years more he was a landscape and cattle painter es-
' teemed but little less than his gifted sister. August* Bonheur found his successive
medals and* hiss red ribbon cf the legion. It is quite possible that the greater
fame cf his eirter overshadowed hie, and that he might have won a higher position
in art under another name.
"Highland Fhefp" Is probably the most noted canvas of all Bonheur"s art
career. It was the talk of the esthetlo world at the time of its first exhibition.
Now that sheep pictures have become a popular fad â almost to the extent of a
craze â the great paintings or this animal and its environment have doubled ln valuj
and large wns of money are paid for the mere privilege of copying the original
picture. All critics have conceded that Bonheur's "Highland Sheep" Is far superior
to the works cf all others who have made animal study their specialty. The only
1 artist who ever equaled him was his own sister.
"PLAYMATES."
E. Louyet's â¢â¢Playmates" Is a scene of home life which Trill appeal to all lovers
of children aad pets. It Illustrates, the sympathy which exists between children and
their animal playmate*, and suggests the charm which the Ingenuous play of the lit-
tle cnes raay bring Into home life. It shows also that imitation of what they have
observed in the lives of their parents influences in a remarkable degree their own ac-
tions. In putting the puppy to bed in her doll's cradle the little girl Is following the
? sample c? her mother's care for her little brother, which she has daily observed.
AlthtHiph her offspring seems to be an unwilling partner to the play, the canine mother
Sr>es not seem greatly concerned, for Bhe has doubtless been often associated with
ie children ln their games and knows that they mean no barm.
The picture is one which bespeak* the artist's cheerful temperament. Into a
commonplace scene he has Infused something of the sympathy which he must have
for the homely joyt cf domestic life. His color also indicates a genial fondness for
what is pleasing and cheerful. It is varied and brilliant, simple and unaffected and
not devoid of refinement. There is even a certain sublety in the placing of the blue-
rreen .in<i yellow-green note* of the cupboard and cradle together in the picture and
balancing them with the mass of the blue apron on the opposite side of the picture.
EITects cf studied arrangement are also to be found in the Judicious placing of the
various notes of rr-d. brown and yellow.
ThÂ« works of this promising young artlrt are not yet familiar in this country,
as there Is- so great a demand that they are generally sold^-to collectors and dealers
as eoon as they ere completed, and he has frequently so many advance orders for
his pictures that his eustomen' have to wait many months before they can have the
satlyfartinr. of possessing one of hiÂ« interesting productions.
His models are taken from hiÂ« own household even the animals, which â¢ he Is
f^nfl of Introducing into his compositions. His familiarity with them is unques-
tionably the secret of his remarkable success ln painting them.
"THE PASSING STORM."
Two favorite themes furnish subjects for the brush of Thomas Moran, K. A., the
artificial architectural beauty of Venice and the grandeur of American landscapes.
â¢"The Passing ?torm." which was painted on Long Inland, furnishes one of the most
beautiful and effective colored reproductions yet published. It is vigorous and yet
harmonious in colcr. dramatic ln effect and well balanced ln its composition. The
warm colur of autumn fcrowns and yellow contrasts with gray rocks and the rich
gr*"enÂ« cf the Ewampy foreground, and above all is a sky full of movement and varied
ln Its colored effects.
It ie the emotional qualities in this, as well as In nearly all of Mr. Moran's paint-
ings, which have contributed much to their success, and yet underlying these there is
a foundation of convincing realism.
In "ThÂ» Pacing Storm" it may be seen that the elements which make up the pic-
ture are reproduced with remarkable fidelity to nature, but at the same time by a
fapifr.t arrangement of masses cf light and <Jark oppositions of brilliant and sub-
duÂ»d color, of broad. si:iiple mseees and intricate detail, the artist reflects his own
poetic trmprran-.cnt in its dramatic effect, wealth of color and technical ability.
Mr. Morin'f attention was first attracted to the possibilities of American" land-
scape In 1*71, when he accompanied the fnlted States Government expedition under Ma-
jor Powell to explore the Yellowstone country. His large painting: of the "Grand Canyon
of the Yellowstone," which wap produced shortly after, was purchased by the Govern-
ment. The painting is so truthful that geologists are able to detect and classify from
It the thousands of feet of canyon wall, and y<et the expression cf a feeling of eublim-
ity ii> po stror^r that it is difficult to believe that he has not idealised his subject.
He has since made several trips to the Rocky Mountains and has visited Cuba
and Mexico, and it may be truthfully said that no artist has done more to make
known to the world the splendors of American landscapes, whose artistic possibilities
he was cne of the first to appreciate.
i Thomas Moran. who is sometimes called the American Turner, was born ln Bol-
ton. Lancashire, England, ln 1S37. Went to Philadelphia with his parents at the age
of 7. He began his artistic career as a wood engraver's apprentice and was made an
FFso'-iate o? the National Academy ln 18S2 and academician in 1SS4. He Is a mem-
ber of the Society cf American Artiste and the Pennsylvania Academy.
"TREASURED MEMORIES."
Not all of thÂ«Â» garlands of war are of laurel and palm, there are others
of withered and bitter leave* which do not crown the victors or repose on the
grama of tho^e who have given their lives for their country. They are worn
hy the women wha have inherited the leiracy of sorrow and loneliness through
â¢he death of a eon. a father or a brother ln war.
They cling- in their bereavement to anything which may keep fresh the mem-
ory of thÂ«-Fe dear ones. Their letter*, portraits, anything they have worn or
owned are treasured as of priceless value, and on such a day as the one appointed
to honor the nation's dead they ceem to bring back something of the real pres-
ence cf the herf>ep who have fallen. .-â¢Â¦Â»-
To express these thcuchtu on canvas is the motive of Bdgar S. Cameron's
picture. "Treasured Mem<->rleÂ«'."
It depicts an aged mother honoring the memory of a son fallen on a Southern
l^ttl^neH. by bringing cut his rusty saber and time-worn uniform to place them
!:> the rhsir he used to sit in as a boy, while she re-reads the letters whose con-
tents she knows by heart.
It is thus on the anniversary of hig death and Decoration day she performs
Filently and alcne what to her has become the celebration of a sacred rite. The
picture is cne fu!l of human interest and sentiment strongly expressed. It tells
its story simply and directly and at the same time it possesses artistic qualities
of a high order. It is admirably composed, effective, pleasing in color and care-
fully elaborated in its details.
Edgar S. Cameron, the artist who has painted this picture, is one of the most
prominent painters of " figure compositions in the West. Few men have the ability
to r>p.:r.t we:i to many different classes of subjects a? he. Ten years ago he was
paintirig military subjects, one of which received honorahle mention ln the Yerkes
prize competition. Then followed decoration for the World's Fair. The largest can-
vas v .e het= painted is a religious subject, 'The Youth of Christ." now loaned to
the fnicn League Club of Chicago. Two years ago he exhibited a striking picture
cf gla^t-bTowrs at work ln the red light of a blow furnace. This was purchased
by the Chicago Woman's Aid Club. At the Chicaro Artists' Exhibition this year h"s
showed an imrx-'i-tart marine painting. "The Voiceful Sea." which was painted
while the artlpt was returning from Paris last year, where he served as a mem-
ber of the international Jury O* the exposition of 1000. This picture was pur-
rhased by the Arche Club.
OsMe* painting these and Tiuntless penre and landscape subjects, Mr. Cam-
rrvrr. has found time to contribute occasionally articles on art to art publications
ani tc art as instructor at the Art Academy- As early as 1SSS he was an exhib-
itor m the Paris Falon. . . "
"IN THE PASTURE."
"In the Pasture." by Julien Jos. presents a rare combination of pictorial and
artistic rjuallties. In it the artist h*s displayed exceptional ability in three direc-
tions â as a tandscapist. a figure painter and an animal pa!ntÂ«r. His varied talents
an- sÂ« evenly balanced find fo harmoniously combined in this picture that it would
be a diffiTilt matter Â»o de^de which be has painted best â the. cattle, the young
1'fasa.nt woman who is caring for their wantf. or the landscape, which serves as a
s<-TÂ»!n^ for both. It Las other qualities which are not the result of the artist's skill
a< a pairtT. but which are the expression of his thought and feeling.
Then* is a vigor and brilliancy to b* Â©twerve<] ln thÂ» effect of sunlight, and he
has given â¢ vlvarity to the movements of the animals and the action of the figure.
In the grass and foliage of the landscape tliere is abundant detail, but it is
painted with a frank, sure touch. fr<e from any suggestion of labored uncertainty ln
his methods of painting. All this combines to give ln the picture an agreeable effect
of truth and lifelikeness.
The cattle are particularly well drawn *nd painted.
It has been said that pictures of horses are less ant to pitas* than representa-
tions of cattle or sheep, for the reason that horses are generally more closely ob-
srrvfd by the public, and defects in the drawing of these animals are more quickly
noted, while in paintings of cattle such defects are overlooked, provided there is
aeroeable color and a picturerque quality of roughness in the painting to conceal
th'-m. ' -
In this painting by Julien Jos there has been no attempt to avoid difficulties.
Forms are well defined, values are truthful- and colors well observed. There Is evi-
dence everywhere of the artist's comprehensive *tudy. from the blades of grass In
the foreground to details of the figure and the animals'.
There is a satlsfylrg sense of completeness, and yet he has shown how to EUb-
erdiriKte parts of his picture to gain unity of subject.
It is fccientlflc rather than emotional painting, and yet is not lacking ln feeling
and spirit. .
Julien Jos is a native of Behrium and has his studio in Brussels. He is a pupil
cf the celebrated cattle painter, Franz de Bcul. and Is, to some extent, a follower
of Julien Dupre.
He was awarded a silver mMal at the Brussels Universal Exposition, and medals
st exhibitions held in Ghent. Antwerp and other European cities. His work Is almost
as well known and appreciated ln America as in Europe.
COSTLY TOYS.
"Costly ToyÂ«" la the title of the art supplement, by Charles Van den Eycken.
The proverbial playfulness of kittens is a favorite subject with painters who
chocs* their models from the domesticated branch of the feline tribe The fact
that the little animals have net been endowed with discretion in . their choice of
plavthings. along with their instinct for play, often leads them to dp much mis-
chief, and it is thle mischief which furnishes an Inexhaustible fund of mate-
rial ut>on 'which Fuch artifts as Eugene Lambert, Mme. Henrictte Ronner and
Charlt* Van den Eycken, t the painter of the original of this art supplement, have
drawn, in producing the pictures which are their lifework.
Other artists cf more serious temperament have used cats as models for rep-
resentations of the savage members of the came family. The anatomy of the do-
mestic cat U almost ider.tical with that of many of its wild cousins, and the fact
that the savage instincts of its ancestors have only a thin veneer of the domesti-
cation makes it a eimple matter for an artist to transform the household tabby Into
a tiger or lioness, as I>eiacroix frequently did. One needs only to observe a cat
drinking, eating cr stalking a mouse or sparrow to note the resemblance recalled
by Whittier. who displayed much of a painter's instinct in his description, in the
lines In "Snow Bound": "The cat's dark silhouette on the wall, a couchant tiger's
seemed *o fall."
In Fuch pictures as the one which is the subject of this notice there are the
elements of lively action, and a pleasing suggestion of Innocence and joyousness
which make them Justly popular. In Van den Eycken's painting there Is also
bright and agreeable color and skillful brush work. Â¦ . . s>
Charles Van den Eycken is a Belgian of pure Flemish descent. He Is still
a vouae man. and has every prsspect cf becoming even more famous In his chosen
branch cf art than the celebrated Mme. Konner. whose pupil he Is. HlÂ» studio is
in Antwerp in the same building as that of his former instructor. During the last
decade his works have become well known in America, and the sale of his pictures
la this country is eteadily increasing.
"THE BIRTHDAY."
Cora Fredericka Freer's painting, "The Birthday." was the most "important
figure eompoettion exhibited tÂ»- a. Chicago artist at the recent exhibition of Amer-
ican oil painting and sculpture at the Art Institute. It la the work which com-
bines the telling of a pleasing story with the , successful rendering of a most Inter-
esting effect of artificial lighting. The four nickering tapers on the birthday cake
illuminate the scene, which It one of tenderness and Intensity as well as of , fes-
The costumes of the little rtrl in whose honor the celebration is made, her
young mother and her comrade suÂ»d guest furnish notes of colors, and the play of
the warm glow from thÂ« tapers on these offers a problem which the artist has
solved tnoFt agreeably.
The expression on the faces of the participants in the pretty fete shows that
she "Is also a close student of character. A smile of love and contentment plays
over the feature* cf the mother at she cutt the cake; the little one looks on with
something of curiosity and wonderment in her Joy, while a look of patient ex-
pectancy plays over the features of her suest. â¢ .

NEW YORK STOCK. LIST,
NKW VOBKj March *_"J.â Union Pacific madt
a momntut In to-day's market similar in char
act* r 'although n( lets violence) to that of
Monday o. laa week pracedins the announce
ment Of tht plan of the <l'?tr : bution of the
Northern t-tcuritiea assets, nut this U-olatr-d
movetrert failed siirnally to carry the general
market with it. This slUKKiehne?* of the gen
f-ral marktt seemed adequately accounted for
in thf rariy dealing* by the confllctinc move
imtit in United. t^talen .Steel preferred, whith
*olu down more than a point below yester
day's Â¦â¢losinB. The- general list seemed to be
hâ¬!'l in suspension by these conflicting move
ment*, but iho discrer.ancy became marked
iati r in tliÂ« <Ja:v ivhcu the' pressure against
I mud t-t&tes S-te^I preferred was relieved
v.-ithout a recovery, however, while the rise iii
Union Pacific became more buoyant.
The renewed strength In the mersrr securi
ties on t*i" curb was the only response that
might be ,n sympathy with the rise In Union
Pa-Jflr. The jceneral list remained Inert untfi
the lally Ju*t at the close. The source of the
moti\e of the buying of Union Pacific was as
much of a mjraterjr as ever, but there can be
no doubt thtt the suspicion has gained a
hold <:n the speculative community that, all
is not peaceful in the rrocess of undoing the
Northern Securities merger. The fear gain*
ground that the real point atls*ue is an ad
\ar.tago cf v^it'on j n fhe transcontinental
field which threatens to reopen the whole dis
pute wnich was fought to so violent a termina
tion in 1901. The fear , is fostered by the
traversing of the history of the formation of
the Northern Securities Company and by the
republii ation cf the contention by E. H. Har
riman in a public hearing that the transfer of
his holdings of Northern Pa^lnc was by private
sal'- to J. P. Morgan & Co., and not by de
lxjsit of the slock with th? Northern. Securities
Company lor exchange Into their stock. The
impreiision thus tet afloat in Wall street Is
that He Union Pacific interests are standing
out for. the return of their original holdings of
Northern Pacific and the control of that system
while It is also felt that there 1Â« no more dispo
sition to yield this peaceably than at any other
previous time. Rtt>ortB of enormous loans made
on Union Pacific collateral kept alive th"
curiosity is to the absorption of that'Stockl
but threw no light on the question. It was not
until thÂ» cksing dealings that the market
shawed any sign of response to the Union Pa
cific. A rise of over 2 points in St. Paul -and
Hiln SouTliern Pacific then pulled the general
list' up to last night's level or .slightly above
The heaviness of United States Steel* preferred

Receipts of Asparagus were nearly 1300 boxes
and prices had a further decline. . The market
was weak owing to the lack- of demand .for
shipping, and there was qultea heavy surplus
unsold at the close. One canner-was In the
market and purchased stveral hundred . boxes
of No. 2 at 303 Vju P*r pound. .Rhubarb was In
free supply and unchanged. Peas were In light
receipt, but sold slowly at easier rates owing
to the poor - quality of the offerings., which
showed the effects of the recent ' rains. " Re
packed Iota of Tomatoes were firmly "held at
the ton rates, while offerings In original pack
ages were offered freely at the Insld: quotation.
The. steamer Curacao, which arrived from- Alex-
Icon ports on. Monday, brought up 140O boxes,
most of which were in poor condition and ' will
have to be repacked. The same . steamer
brought- up' 36 boxes of Green Peppers, which
were offering at 25@.'!0c per pound: A con
signment of five crates of Florida Tomatoes
which arrived on Monday, was sold at $3 50
per crate.'
A firm feeling prevailed In the market for
table Potatoes and trade was 'quite active, as
most deal:-rs were expecting a. higher range of
prices. The best lots of river and Oregon Bur
bank? were rradily marketed at full figures and
cheap btock moved more freely. | The firmer
feslin? is duÂ» largely 10 reports of extensive
damage to tUe growing cropa in the flooded
river districts. Some dealers reported a weak
market for s<Â»ed kinds, while others were firm
In their VhWB and were still asking hl^h prices.
Dry Onions were in good request at the top
rate, with seme dealers asking a little more,
but no actual, sales were reported over $2 50
per cental. . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦

The Oceanic. Steamship Company's
liner Alameda, Captain Dowdell, ar
rived yesterday from Honolulu with
1763 tons of cargo and 240 passengers.
Southwest winds and clear skies fa
vored the liner all the way from the
isjand port. She came up in five days
and twenty-one hours. Among her pas
sengers were eighty-two Japanese* who
have been living on the islands and
have come here in search of wider op
portunities.
Count E. Bonisi, who recently mar
ried Miss Spaulding of Kauai, was a
passenger on the Alameda. His. visit to
the mainland will be brief, as he is
booked to return on the Alameda,
which sails Saturday morning. Mr. and
Mrs. S. H. Boardman of this city, who
have been passing their honeymoon in
the Hawaiian Islands, returned on the
liner. Alexander Young, one of Hono
lulu's oldest and wealthiest residents
and proprietor cX the Young Hotel,
came upon the Alameda.
The Alameda docked'' about a Jll
o'clock. She left for the sugar refinery
about 4 o'clock, but long before'^ she
moved she had taken on "board all th!2
liquid fuel she will require for her next
voyage. The oil lighter was alongside
the liner almost as soon as she was
made fast to the wharf, and the opera
tion of taking fuel was completed al
most in less" time than the gear for
loading coal could have been rigged
and/taken down. And when the liner's
tanks were supplied there was no coal
dust to be washed from the decks and
cabins.
The Alameda's passengers included
the following named:

SAN- FRANCISCO STOCK EXCHANGE
Following were the sales on the tfan Fran
cisco Stock an<l Exchanse Board yesterday:
Dr. Boscowitz, on being recalled, tes
tified that the doctor on watch was,
during that time, the sole master of
the hospital, and that it was his duty
to examine into the condition of each
ynd every patient there. .
"I don't feel that . I am responsible
for not knowing that -the man was in
the hospital," continued Dr. PawlickL
"The steward has the key of the in
sane department, and he ajone can
open It. I never go into the Insane
ward. I asked where this man held
for observation was, but nobody seem
ed to know. He was secreted over in
the Juvenile department."
In reply to a question by the Cor
oner, the witness admitted that he did
not make the rounds when he went on
watch so far as the insane portion of
the hospital was "concerned.
He found a slight abrasion on his
head, a dullness in both lungs and a
temperature of 102% degrees. In his
opinion the patientj died of hypostatic
pneumonia, causpd bv a weak action
of the heart. There was no ice bag
on the patient's head at that time.
The witness ordered an Ice bag "and
strychnine to arouse the heart.
Dr. Qeor&e F. Brackett testified that
it was his habit to refer to the regis
ter, and then to make the rounds of
the hospital. When he examined Spil
lane he diagnosed the case as a-pos
sible fracture of the skull. The stew
ard did not tell him about the diagno
sis of Dr. Boscowitz. The witness con
sidered that Dr. Boscowitz had made
the same diagnosis, or he would not
have prescribed the ice cap. All the
doctors connected with the hospital
are expected to make the rounds. At
10:30 o'clock Dr. Pawlicki telephoned
the witness that a grave case of pneu
monia was at the hospital. He did not
mention Spillane's name, and the wit
ness had no idea that he was trie
patient mentioned, therefore he tele
phoned back to Pawlicki to treat the
case for pneumonia.
Dr. C. F. Pawlicki testified that he
did rot see Spillane at all until 10:30
at night, when Steward Manville call
ed him and said that a patient in the
juvenile department was very sick. The
witness thereupon ordered Spillane
to be taken out into a lighter room for
examination, and when the witness
examined Spillane he found him to be
dying.
PXEUOMNIA IS \AMED.
Dr. Boscowitz testified that Spillane I
was brought in on his watch, and that I
after having made a careful and thor--;
ough examination of the patient, as
was his usual practice in all cases, he
came to the conclusion that Spillane's
skull was fraefdred at the base. He j
informed Steward O'Day of this factj.
and ordered him to put Spillane to be<T
in one of the small rooms "on the
other side," where he would not be
likely to be disturbed by the other pa
tients, and to put an Ice cap on his
head. The witness then entered in the
record book opposite the name of
Spillane the words "Held for, observa
tion." He then reported off watch. It
is the - custom at that hospital, he
said, when a doctor comes on dutv to
look at the register and note the num
ber and kind of cases. in the hospital, ',
and then personally exa'mine each case
after receiving- whatever Information
the steward on watch may have had.
Steward James O'Day corroborated 'Â¦
the evidence of Dr. Boscowitz in every I
particular. When the witness went .
off duty he turned over the case to;
Steward Barry, and informed him that
Spillane was suffering from a fracture
of the skull. j
The inquest was held yesterday
morning by Coroner Leland, and the
matter was pretty thoroughly Investi
gated. When the jury presented the
verdict exonerating Dr. Boscowitz, the
Coroner suggested that it conveyed the
inference that the "other doctors con
nected with the hospital were to blame.
The jury, he said, could not know
this, because Dr. Charles F. Millar
had not been examined as to his con
nection with the case. He advised the
Jury to reconsider its verdict, which
it did by striking out the paragraph
exonerating Dr. Boacowitz and allow
ing the remainder to stand. It exon
erates Motormun W. Mansfield, and
concludes: "We* recommend the re
visa! of the system of entering and
recording diagnoses of cases in the
said Emergency Hospital, in order that
when disputes arise In the treatment
of cases the blame can be properly
placed upon the person or persons in
fault."
SPILLAXI-: AT HOSPITAL..
!.
A Coroner's jury yesterday in
! vostigated the case of Hugh Spil
'1ane, who died of a fractured skull
; at the Central Emergency Hospital on
i March 1". Spillane, while intoxicated,
1 fell heavilv to the ground and frac
! tured his skull after alighting from
' a streetcar at the intersection of
! Fourth and Howard streets on the
evening of March 161 He died in the
j hospital on the 17th, and his death
: was reported to the Coroner as hav
' ing been caused by pneumonia. The
'Â¦ autopsy showed that a fracture of the
' skull had been the cause of death.
'J l.c-rc is a faÂ«r prospoct that enter
prUins and wealthy citizens of San
Frandfcco Â«ill toiitributo $250000 for
;i:i ;)tj'jHri'jin In Golden Oale Park. It
v,; : s represented t.Â» \.he Park Commis-
Efonen at an executive session held
four creeks apo that the following con
tributiens to the proposed enterprise
h;id hern proffered: Dr. IJarry Tevis
Jir.o.OfiO. Dr. M. Herzsiein 550,000 and
OommlissloneV W. J. Dingee $50,000.
Tbe executive conference, which was
hold at the office of the president of
the hoard, was attended by Commis-
Bioners Dinpee. Uoyd and
Altniann. The strictest Becrecy was
rojoined, as the Commissioners were
told that publicity would surely thwart
the enterprise. The Commissioners in-
Cmded to secure the money proffered
;: ad s^lert the site on the ocean beach,
T'-rsr the Dutch windmill, before mak
ing public announcement of the event.
The. intelligence was too good to keep,
hence some one babbled. A. li. Spreck
els, president <>f the board, and Com-
CalsElaner Reuben H. Uoyd fear that lha
publicity, in this particular case, will
postpone for a l<>ng: time, if not entirely
deffat, the execution of the plans..
It is intimated that the sum of $300,
000 v./Â»u!d be sufficient tw establish an
aquarium worthy of Golden (Jate Park.
Every effort will be put forward by the
1 ommfssion to raise the money as
speedily as possible. The muniflcence
Â¦f IÂ»r. Harry Tevis' contribution is
especially gratifyfng to the board.
Dr. Harry L. Tevis dfflined last night
to discuss the matter in any way
whatever.

little value when the mind is troubled â you
need more substantial aid and advice. This is
Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gtves you
when you call on him for a first-eluss clair-
voyant reading. He asks you no questions,
but tells you what you wish to know.
He docs not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in jour case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find tbc cause of trouble and

Fritz. R. W.'- Putnam, a notary public
at Paso Robles, testified that .on Sep
tember 13, 1899, while Dr. Brennan and
Father Grqjr were staying at the hotel
there, the latter signed a document as
signing all his money on deposit in .the
Hibernia Bank to the defendant, and
that the aged clergyman 'seemed to be
"in good and vigorous mind" at the
time. Five photographs of as many
different houses in which the doctor
and priest had dwelt were produced to
disprove the charge that the defendant
had insufficiently cared for his pa
tient's comfort." Mary Ann Wilkinson,
who had served as housekeeper for
Brennan, testified that his 'treatment
of Father Grey had always been good,
and then Brennan submitted ah affida
vit made by him and dated January 7,
1904, that- Father Grey had signed th,e
checks? on which he drew the $37,000
from the Hibernia Bank.

McEnerney Â°also * contended that the
indictment was without force here as
an indictment, but was to be examined
as any other bit of evidence. He then
attacked it as failing to make a pre
sumptive case against the defendants,
apd closed by citing cases to support
the defendants' .contention that the
Government is bound to support the
indictment w&h other evidence. The
same line of argumen.t was carried on
by Wheeler, who again questioned the
jurisdiction of 'the court at Washing
ton and was reminded'by the Commis
sioner of his wish not to consider that
matter.
McEnerney made a Tierce attack on
H<^nf*y's positions/ repeating in the
main arguments that had been set
forth by his associates, Schlesinger and
Knight, on Monday, but driving them
home with great force. He further ar
gued that California and Oregon not
having attacked the Government's title
to the lands deeded to it by the defend
ants, that title was good, and therefore,
that every act alleged inÂ» the first
thirty-four courts of the indictment
was an entirely lawful act, because the
Government had not been defrauded of
any land. If any fraud had been com
mitted it was against those States.
Replying s tp- a question by Heney,
counsel- made this remarkably frank
statement of the position taken by the
defense:
We" hold that when a man conveys land
within a reservation to the Government In
exchange for.; land selected outside the reserva
tion ttic transaction * js complete whei> the
Govcrnmept 'acc*Dts it and cannot be at
tacked, no matter whetKer the land within
thcÂ° : reservation l^as b*cn acquired' by fraud
or net. Â»
mcK.vi:hxky's able plea.
The Commissioner brushed the whole
matter aside with the significant re
mark: "I do not regard the warrant
as very material, but will admit It. As
at present advised I am unwilling to
go into the question of . the court's
jurisdiction. It is not my business to
interfere with a superior tribunal."
The rest of the day was occupied by
McEnerney and Wheeler in replying to
Heney. Wheeler ha<J not concluded
when 4 o'clock brought the adjourn
ment, and he wiK continue this morn
ing at 10:30. V
Heney closed by citing eases to show
that the Government's' titles obtained
from the defendants would nof stand
against a suit by California or- Oregon.
Then, after offering in evidence the
bench warrant from the Supr.eme Court
of the District of Columbia, he rested.
Schlesinger and Wheeler of defendants'
counsel vigorously objected to the war
rant, the latter declaring that it had
been issued by a court without juris
diction.
"That is just what we allege these
defendants did," replied Heney. "They
object that the indictment is defective
because it falls to set forth, in each of
the thirty-four counts, which method
was- used. But that was not necessary.
The indictment simply charges that the
defendants adopted these three methods
of obtaining school lands fraudulently,
in order toÂ«have them included in the
reservations and then exchange them
for the thirty-four tracts of outside
lands belonging to the Government."
HteACOCK LETS IX LIGHT.
At this point Commissioner Heacock
interrupted with a question that was
at once taken by all in the courtroom
as showing his agreement with the
Government's position. He said:
L'nder the words of the indictment specify
ing: the iiarrrls the defendants are charged
with c^nspirinc to ohtaln from the State by
fraud three methods of a!leÂ£ed frauQ are set
fcrth. May it not be true that in the. case
of the larcer parcels offered to the Govern
ment all three of these methods were used
to obtain ! nsscssion from the States? May
not one section or quarter sc-lion in the tract
hsvo l>een obtained on a fictitious name, an
other by using; the name of a man not quali
fied to buy. and still another part of the,
tract by usinp thÂ» name of a man who. al
th-HiEh nualifled. had no intention of settling
upon the land?
The indictment here is valid' in spite of the
defendants' objection that we charge they
conspired to defraud the Government by three
methods, one or more of which they claim
were lawfu!. In fact all we were required to.
Allege was that the defendants conspired to
defraud the Government and that In further
ance of this unlawful agreement they com
mitted one overt act. If two of the methods
by which the defendants grot possession of
the State school lands should bÂ«Â» shown to be
lawful the indictment would still stand as to
the -third method. '
The forest reservation act was made neces
sary by the stripping of the timber from
(aft a reap throughout the* country. It has
never been the Government's policy to make
money out of its outside lands, but to hold
them for the benefit of the citizens that should
become actual settlers. It was never con
templated that fraudulent titles- lnsi.1Â» the
reservations could be exchanged for valuable
tracts outside.
United-, States Commissioner E. H.
Heacock spent the entire day yesterday
in listening to further argument in the
land fraud cases on the motion of the
two defendants, Fred A. Hyde and
Henry P. Dimond, to dismiss the Gov
ernment's complaint and relieve them
from the necessity of going to the na
tional capital for trial. Several inti
mations given by the Commissioner
during the day were accepted as indi
cating his disinclination to grant the
motion, unless the defendants put in
evidence establishing their Innocence,
but his final decision will not be known
until the conclusion of the argument
to-day.
Francis J. Heney, special counsel for
the Government, in concluding his
argument, arraigned the State officials
of California and Oregon for negligence
in the methods by which individuals
had been able to get possession of
large areas of the school lands through
fraudulent means, and in* violation of
the purpose of the Government that
these cessions Ehould benefit the whole
people of the United States by being
sold only to actual settlers. Continuing
he said:

had no money to pay for them, and the
bartender refused to serve them. .Then
Eppinger dressed himself, went down

the assault was made. After striking

After straining their ears and ' their
imagination to ascertain what j Steven
Sadowa was trying to make intelligible
expert dialecticians groaned and con*
fessed themselves baffled. Linguistic
sharps also stood . beaten by Sadowa's
verbal contortions, and finally Judge
Mogan postponed his hearing of the
man's testimony until the services of
a person qualified to translate muti
lated Polish into up-to-date ' English
can be obtained. Enough of Steven's
gibberish could be interpreted to con
vey the information that he learned
to talk in some part of Poland's fair
land that is in proximity to the em
pire of the Czar and has mixed up
some of the Slavonic lingo with its own
origipal tongue.
It was .as a complainant that Steven
appeared in court. He charged a mid
dle aged and decidedly unprepossess
ing female named Sarah Martin. with
having pilfered $180 belonging to him,
and it was his effort to explain how
the alleged robbery occurred that drove
the interpreters to despair. From other
witnesses, however, it was learned that
Steven came to the great, city from
the town of Hanford, where for two
years he had worked industriously as
a dairyman and scrimped his pecuniary
expenditures until he had saved $300
of his scanty salary. With this goodly
sum in his pocket he sought social
recreation on the Barbary Coast and
found it in a Pacific-street dance hall.
There he saw and was Immediately
smitten by the matured charms of.
Sarah. Without insisting upon the for
mal introduction that in some other cir
cles of society is considered an essen
tial preliminary - to the proper fore
gathering of strangers. Miss Martin
permitted herself to be addressed col
loquially by the gentleman from Han
ford. In her defense it may be pleaded
that his weird dialect left her in doubt
as to what he was saying when he
asked her to accept liquid refreshments
at his expense, but such a plea must
collapse before the fact that- she un
hesitatingly imbibed the beverage
when he handed it to her. It has also
been proven by the undisputed testi
mony of persons among those present
that Steven and Sarah did not dance,
but nosed as wall flowers and sipped
arcient spirits until they departed from
the temple of Terpsichore in the small
hours of morning.
What happened after that is known
only to Steven and Sarah, but prob
ably will be disclosed to-day with the
aid of an interpreter, in search of whom
the city is now being scoured.
