LONDON, March 30.â Chancellor yon
Billow's announcement yesterday in the
Reichstag of Germany's policy toward
Morocco came as a complete surprise
to the British Government. It was be
lieved, as had been generally declared,
that Emperor William's visit < ri to
Tangier was without political " signifi
cance. â¢ . . ; ' - : : â 
When the French entente was
concluded in ISJ)3,. France officially ; in
formed Germany of the fact and I also
of the agreement, between herself and
Spain, signed six months later, where
by Fraiice was given a ; /' mandate ,to
regulate the 'anairs of Morocco. Re
forms in Morocco were imperatively
necessary tor the good of all the Pow
ers commercially mteresttd m ihe
country, a.iv as a concert oi the powers
had proved, so difficult ana unworkao'ic
in Turkey,'; china' and eisewnere, where
it had been tried, it was the opinion
of the .bruish Government that one
power aione could best exert ; pressure
on the Sultan of Morocco. :
France,, being far the-most concerned,
financially ana commercially, naiuraiiy
was given the mandate to institute | it
forms. ' As the open-door was ;: sruar
anteed and equal commercial rights in
sured to all the countries concerned. -it
/was said at the Foreign 'Office ; that iit
was difficult to understand here \ what
could -be Germany's, motive. The Ger
man attitude, it is , believed: will <-i-r
talnly. make the Stiltar of Morocco fJe

will be destructive to : trade and 'en

AN INI KIKXDLY ACT.
The editorial articles and dispatches
printed in the London newspapers this
morning, reflect a certain sense of
uneasiness, almost amounting to irri- i
tation. at the idea, based on Chancellor <
yon Bulow's speech in the Keichstas:
on March 2'J, that Emperor William's
visit tv Tangier has a distinctly politi
cal motive. The subject was much
commented upon in the lobbies of the
Houses of Parliament yesterday.
"Russia's eclipse is Germany's op- I
portunity. ' crystallizes in a sense the
general idea prevalent on the subiect.
It is suggested that Emperor William, '
far from desiring to irritate France, I
wishes rather to emphasize the dimin- j
isbed value of the Russian alliance and
thereby persuade France of the ad
visability of a rapprochement with
Germany. At the* same time those least
inclined to cavil at the German Emper
or's action admit that it is calculated
to stiffen the Sultan's resistance to
French policy in Morocco and so re
tard the civilizing scheme involved in
the Anglo-French agreement.
In this light the usually moderate
Daily Telegraph says the Emperor's
visit to Tangier can only be regarded
as an unfriendly act. Other papers are
inclined to doubt the wisdom of Em
peror William's policy. which they
think is more likely to result in
strengthening the Anglo-French en
tente. Much satisfaction, therefore, is
â¢x pressed i-X the exchange of visits
which is being arranged for the French
and British fleets during the coming
summer.

Preparations are complete for the re

procession. The Moorish and German
flags are displayed everywhere. The

natives are very enthusiastic over the
welcome to be given the German Em

Emperor William will land at 8

by Abdul Makek, a Moorish deputa

read a letter from the Sultan bidding
the Emperor formal welcome and pre

Special Dispatch to The Call
CHICAGO, March 30.â The rea> own
ership of the White River Valley Rail
road, recently incorporated at Pierre,
S. D., for $50,000,000, was revealed to
i day when the Chicago, Milwaukee and
St. Paul Company announced that it
would extend its line about seventy
miles beyond Chamberlin, S. D.
The White River Valley Railroad
! Company is now constructing a road
j which the St. Paul admits is to be an
extension of that system. To build a
line of seventy miles would not cost
more than $350,000. Therefore it is evi
dent that despite official denials the
White River Valley Railway Company
was capitalized for $50,000,000 for the
purpose of extending thp St. Paul sys
tem to the Pacific Coast.
The reason for official denials that
the St. Paul Company is back of the
I White River Valley Company may be
i that part rrf the route projected to the
Pacific- coast crosses the Rosebud In
dian Reservation and a permit has not
been obtained from the Government to
i lay tracks there and to build a bridge
over the Missouri River.
While it is said that the St. Paul
; system plans an extension of only sev
! enty miles westward of Chamberlin, S.
I D., it practically Is certain that the
: work of extension will be flushed un
j til the Pacific Coast is reached. It has
I been asserted that for several years
i the St. Paul has been procuring valu
j able tracts of land at Portland for ter
1 minals.
Eventually it - robably will be found
that Harriman and the Standard Oil
interests have acquired control of the
j St. Paul system, after realizing that
J. J. Hill will control the Great. North

O'GRADY IS APPOINTED
POLICE COMMISSIONER
ALEXANDER L.
O'GRADY, a
young attorney and
friend of Abe Ruef, was
yesterday made Police
Commissioner by Mayor
Schmitz to take Hut
ton's place. The appoint
ment was long deferred
in order that Commis
sioners Drinkhouse and
Reagan might maintain
a majority on the board
and oust Chief Wittman.
It is possible that the
new Chief will be named
when O r Grady takes his
seat at the meeting of â 
the. Commissioners to
night. It is believed that
Detective Dinan will be
given the place.
To Take His Seat
at To-Night's
Session.
DINAN TO BE CHIEF
Way Is Now Clear
to Give Place
to Him.
POLITICAL ASPECTS
Alexander L. O'Grady. lawyer, 33
years of age and loyal politician in
the Ruef camp, was appointed Police
Commissioner by JAtyor Schmitz yes
terday. He will take the place made
vacant by the ousting of H. W. Hut
ton, and is expected to steady the
board with legal advice and give valu
able service for the administration.
The removal of George W. Wittman
from the head of the department haÂ»
ir>g been accomplished, Schmitz was
ready to name the new member. It
is weeks ago that the Mayor exerted
his prerogative and brought Hutton's
career of sleuthing in Chinatown to a
close. But the opportunity was at
hand to get Wittman out of the way,
much hated for political reasons. Com
missioners Drinkhouse and Reagan
were willing to do- the trick, and
Schmitz therefore left them in major
ity on the board.
There were complications confront
ing the Mayor, and he was not assured
that O'Grady and the influences behind
him favored the dismissal of the Chief.
So be held back the appointment of
the fourth member to give Drinkhouse
and Reagan free rein until their Job
was done. Wittman, strong for law
and order, too unyielding for political
schemings/ was down and out, and in
anticipation of the meeting of the
Commission to-night the Mayor yes
terday named O'Grady.
DIXAN IX Li: \D FOU CHIEF.
Now comes the selection of a new
Chief for the Police Department. The
commission may make their decision
to-night and every indication points to
Jerry Dinan. detective sergeant and
personal friend of the Mayer, as the
man. It is not certain that the ap
pointment will be made to-night, for
there may be more administration raa
neuverings to be done, but action is
to be expected as soon as the new Com
missioner is sworn in.
Mayc-r Schmitz declared yesterday
that the matter of choosing a new
Chief would be allowed to rest a while
probably, but the Mayor is glib in con
cealment of his deep plannings, and
his denial is not to be taken into ac
count. He also gave out the impres
sion that Dinan had net been fully de
cided upon, but it can be stated au
thoritatively that the detective had
been tully agreed upon in the council
that is already laying plans for the
coming campaign.
Only ill luck in the home stretch now
stands between Dinan and the proud
station in which Jerry must wear a
long coat that Haps at the knees and
a front bedecked with big gilt buttons.
Only the uncertainties that make po
litical life miserable now face the hail
detective, and then, if there are no bad
turnings, he will have over 600 police
men at beck and nod, and attain the
heights of power for political enter
prise.
Public Works Commissioner Frank
A. Maestretti at one time seriously en
dangered Dinan's chances for the place.
No man is more valuable to the ad
ministration in political campaigning
than is Maestretti, and when he wants
anything from the administration he
generally gets it. When he asked
Mayor Schmitz to have the commission
make him Chief of Police the Mayor
gave a listening ear and the bright
skies for Dinan clouded.
MAESTItETTI HAD AMBITION.
But ihc Grand Jury by its indict
ment of the Public Works Commis
sioner for subornation of perjury cut
short his further scaling the pinnacles
of fame and political endeavor. Not
that Mayor Schmitz or the Police Com
missioners, wbu must obey his orders,
had deserted Maestretti or believed for
a moment that their compatriot was
guilty of a despicable crime, but it
would be unwise for obvious reasons to
place a man at the head of the city's
Police Department who was at that
time under accusation of a felony.
So the Grand Jury aided the cause
of Dinan. It may be said that the
Grand Jury gave first aid to Dinan,
for its attack on the Police Commission
for failure to. suppress gambling in
Chinatown gave that body the oppor
tunity of founding charges on which
Wittman might be ousted and the of
fice made vacant for another.
Commissioner O'Grady is a warm
friend of Maestretti and undoubtedly
would havp stood pat on the chiefship.
Commissioner Poheim, it is known,
would nlso have preferred the Public
Works Commissioner. But, Maestretti j
put jut of the running, the field was
left clear for Dinan.
As to the personality of the new Po
lice Commissioner, it may be said that
he is affable r.nd competent for thr
place. H"F.- came most prominently into
public notice when he recently defend
ed Adolph Steffens, one of the two
men convicted of ballot-box stuffing.
He is a graduate of Santa Clara Col
lege and completed the course of the
Hastings Law School eleven years ago,
and since that time he has practiced his
profession in this city. "\ S
At one time the Mayor was on the
point of appointing his brother. Herbert
to the commissionersuip. Herbert
Schmitz came to the conclusion, how
ever, that he did not care to brave un
favorable criticism to which he might,
be subjected as Police Commissioner.
O'Grady had the very strong support of
Abe Ruef and had been active in the
last campaign for Schmitz in speech
making.
The Mayor will hand O'Grady hu*
commission to-day, so he will take his
seat at to-night's meeting of the Police
Board.
O'Grady's appointment ijs Police
Commissioner is part of a programme
to which publicity was given by The
Call a month ago. Herbert Schmitz is
now at liberty to take his old place as
secretary of the Park Com mission an^l
the Mayor says he will do so. James
rte Succa will resign to accept the posi
tion of storekeeper of the Board of Ed
ucation.
CARRINGTON'S
WOES INCREASE
Snecial Cable to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, March 30.â Major
General Corbin, commanding; the army
in the Philippines, was to-day instruct
ed by cable to order the court-martial
of John Frank Del Carrington. First
United States Infantry, on charges of
conduct unbecoming an officer and a
gentleman.
This officer has already been con
victed by the Manila court of embez
zlement of official funds intrusted to his
care for the preparation of the Philip
pine exhibit at St. Louis. He was sen
tenced to forty years' imprisonment,
which is equivalent to a life sentence,
as he is fifty years old. But. despite
his conviction, he is still an officer of
the army. He is also the senior maior
of the infantry, and, as lieutenant
colonel of that branch of the service.
is to be promoted and retired on
April 6.
Major Carrington's case is blocking
promotions. None of the officers Junior
to him can be promoted over his
head and of course the President will
not advance an officer convicted of a
felony.
It is considered certain that by an
army court-martial Major Carrinsrton
will quietly be found guilty and sen
tenced to dismissal from the service.
In the civil courts his case has been
appealed.

MERRILL'S SENSATIONAL STORY
MAKES WORK FOR GRAND JURORS
Will Try to Probe Offering of Money
to a Maestretti Case Witness.
"Of course, the Grand Jury is inves
tigating the Merrill story." said Fore
man Andrews yesterday in discussing
the startling tale the principal witness
against Public Works Commissioner
Maestretti told the night before as to
an offer of $1500 to leave the State.
"I was at work on the matter until 4
o'clock this morning." added the fore
man, as he ya\\":ied.
Andrews is chock full of nervous en
ergy. He brims with enthusiasm when
he. gets on a good trail. If he thinks
there is a chance to accomplish some
thing in the way of running wrong
doers to earth the blanket of night
hoicis no sleep for him.
"Have you been able to learn the
identity or the men who approached
Aierrili with an offer of SISOO to leave
the State?"
"If I have succeeded I couldn't at this
time give out any information. We are
still working on the matter."
It was ascertained, however, that the
foreman had not been, able to connect
Maestretti with the matter in any way.
Merrill from his station on the car ob
tained a close \iew of the stranger who
said he would pay him $1500 if he- would
"get out" and beyond the jurisdiction
ot the court. But he was unable to
identify the man, and investigation
thus far is therefore very much up in
the air.
ALWAYS DONE UNDER COVER.
"Such things are always done under
good cover," explained Foreman An
i drews, "and it is a very difficult thing
' to establish identity. Even after learn
i ing wh6 the man was that had the $1500
' sack at his disposal it would probably
be equally difficult to connect him in
any way with Maestretti.
"Let me assure you that this at
tempting to tamper with witnesses is
j nothing new to us," the foreman pro
ceeded with some heat. "From the very
beginning 1 of the Grand Jury's investi
gation of the ballot-box stuffing there
; has been intimidation and tampering
I with witnesses. So many of these
j stories had come to me that, to tell the
I truth, I did not at first realize the lm
i portance of the story that Merrill had
I to tell."
The foreman gave full credence to
Merrill's story, and no effort will be
spared to find out who it was that of
j fered him $1500 to leave the State and
i who had instigated this scheme to get
I the mast important witness against
Maestretti out of the way.
There is also much mystery a3 to who
have been making file threats of vio
lence against the election officer who
j says Maestretti sought to have him tea-
I tify falsely at the trial of Charles Wy
\ man. Many times the intimation has
been conveyed to the carman that he

that both hi and Mrs". Merrill now re

HEIR TO ITALY'S THRONE HAS
ENGLISH NURSE.
British Hospital Matron Is Boss
of Royal Nursery.
' â¢ ROME, March SO.
By their selection
=of an Englishwo
man to boss the
royal nurseries the
King and Queen of
Italy have given
further, proof or
their faith that
English trained
nurses know inor.?
about how babies
should be raised
than any other
folk. The King
himself was put in
charge of an Eng
lish nurse before.
: he had begun to
cut his teeth.
Though now he is
credited with pos
sessing a tougher
constitution than
fmy other Euro
pe â  a monarch,
when born he wÂ«ss
co weak and sickly
it was feared that
,he would never
c grow up. By the
advice of sundry
wise and learned
Italian doctors the
Job of raisinsr him
was turm-d ovei i,.
*n English nurse.
Fh Â«> put him
through a course
of infantile sprouts
that soon made a
healthy youngster
of him.
. An English
r.uv?e, Miss Dick
f n s, has had
charge of Princess
Yolanda. the first,
torn of the Italian
royal babies, since
her birth. Another
English nurse . was
appointed to look
after Princess Ma
fa Ida when she
made her appear
ance and sorely
disappointed the
whole nation by
turning out a girl.
Before the advent
Â«f the last baby.
Prince Humbert of
Piedmont, the hÂ»ir
to the throne- a
third English nurse

TEETHIN
Mas engaged to
take care of, the anxiously awaited
little stranger. And now a fourth
English nurse, Miss McCord, has
arrived to take general supervision
of the royal nurseries. Miss McCord
is the "she who must be obeyed." both
by the royal babies and the three
nurses previously appointed. For
eleven years she was the matron of the
Qu^en Charlotte* Hospital, is familiar
"with every ache and ailment that can
afflict a infancy and has .mastered, all
the" latest wrinkles in the .science of
rearing healthy children.
t At th*> Italian court this complete
surrender of the royal babies to EnÃ
lish nurses is not exactly popular. It
is regarded as in. some sort a reflection
on Italiae mothers, who are convinced
that they can raise babies quite as u-eil
as aw other worn *Â»n and have no need
(4 foreign instruction on the subject.
But the flat has gone forth and hence
forth English nurses will rule the' royal
nurseries. "What is here known as the
English system of training childhood
is supposed t<Â» be peculiarly adapted
to the development of health, strength
and harflihood. It is to be applied in
its most rigorous form to Prince Hum
bert as ; soon as he outgrows the tod
<ilinÂ£ sta,ge. 'â¢ A strenuous course has
been mapped- out for his education,
which will probably lead him to con
clufle, long before he gets out of his
teens, that being a Crown Prince - is
not all that it is cracked up to be by a
long shot- The expectation is that it
win make such another man of him as
his father, but children who are trained
in childhood In the way they should go
don't always stick to itâ especially
when that training is a severe one. :.
c English nurses are in high â  favor at :
c the Russian court. The X'zarlna was
greatly distressed when Miss Eager,"
who had ' charge of the tittle Czar
evitch, resigned her situation . a
little while ago. She immediately
c sent a message to a London in
stitution "asking that - two trained
nurses be sent out to fill the vacancy.
But the nursery at the Russian royal
palace is hardly so attractive a one as
at the Italian court 'just now. The pos

ACCIDENTS MAR
A TRIAL TRIP
SEATTLE, Wash.. March 30 â
T\v,nty-ti\p knots was the average
s?>Â»Â«*d made by the torpedo-b iat de
stroyrr (ioldsborough on her final
trial held in the waters -of Elliott Bay
this afternoon. <>n the fifth lap of ttte
mile course the craft made 29.4 knots
for a half mile, but she failed to keep
it up. and from the report of the trial
board there is little hope that she will
ever be ribl* to develop an average of
more than twenty-five knots.
True to her reputation, the Golds
borouph featured tlie trial with a series
of accidents. They were of a minor
character, however, consisting of trou
ble with her auxiliary engines and the
blowing out of packing in her steam
connections.

HARBIN, March 30.â Japanese scout
ing parties are very active in endeav
oring to pierce the screen Of the Rus
sian vanguard posts and develop the
P<--siiion and strength of the positions,
their attempts at times verging on the
nature of reconnaissances in force. A
lew Japanese batteries which have
pushed far forward occasionally drop
shells in suspected places.
Yesterday there was a smart brush
where General Mistehenko is stationed,
the Japanese pressing forward in a de
termined endeavor to make a thorough
recvnnaifcsaoce and learn the disposi
tions in this quarter. The Russians re
pelled the advance without uncovering
their dispositions. There were insignifl- ,
cant losses.
Aside from these reconnaissances af- j
fairs are generally quiet on the south- |
em positions.
Chinese say that heavy Japanese re- |
infoi cements are constantly arriving.
Late fighting has shown the admir- '
able nature of Japanese methods of
gathering information. Every infantry
detachment, when moving to attack or
occupy a new position, carries a reel
of slender telephone wire previously
connected with a battery in the sup
port, and the effects of fire and the
movement Of troops are speedily re-.
ported from the most advanced lines.
Harbin, which was greatly excited
during the progress of the Russian re- |
treat, has quieted since the Russian
troops halted.

JAPANESE LOAN
IS NOW CLOSED!
At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon sub
scription* on the Pacific. Coast for; the
latest Japanese loan were closed. Ad
vices were received during-' the. day
from banks and others in the interior
and at various Pacific Coast points
by the Nevada National and "Anglo
v.aliforr:ian banks, to whom were en
trusted the handling of the loan for
the Pacific Coast. The total amount
that was subscribed through the two
banks was $4,200,000.
.'J.'Ofi.ooi' of the loan for disposal. The
subscriptions exceeded that amount by
J1.70C.000. As the total amount to be
disposed of in America is but $150,000.
of>o, it will be observed that San Fran
cisco makes a large showing propor
tionate to its Bisse. No banker coulid
say yesterday just what the Pacific
Coast allotment will finally be deter
mined to be. The loan portion allot
ted to New York has been subscribed
five tinus over.
Considering the demonstration that
San Francisco has made of its financial
ability on the occasions furnished by
the placing r.f two imperial Japanese
loans, the city may be dealt with lib
erally in making the apportionment.
The transactions concerned with the
latest loan have attracted the atten
tion of local financiers to a marked de
gree. The two days' record in this city
is a cause for local pride.
WRONGED WIFE SLAYS
HUSBAND WITH HATCHET
Austrian Laborer Killed by Woman
He Had Treated With Great
Brutality.
PITTSBURG, Pa.. March 30. â
Michael Novackovich, an Austrian la
borer, was murdered at his home
while he lay sleeping in a bed early
to-day by his wife, Annie. The crime
was a brutal one, the woman using a
hatchet. The crime was discovered
by a boarder, who .notified the police.
The woman and seventeen foreigners
were arrested and locked up in the
etation, where the police later ob
tained a confession from Mrs. No
vackovich.
The cause assigned for the crime
was revenge for ill treatment by the
husband, who, it is alleged, insisted
on his wife leading an immoral life.

ROBBERS END
HIS ROMANCE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE, March 30.â 8. W. Coler
of Jackson. Kans.. left Louisville for
his home to-night, a wiser and sadder
man. He came here with the expecta
tion of marrying Miss Nan Pollard of
2X35 West Walnut street, with whom
he had conducted a courtship by mail.
He departed to-night without a bride,
but with a more extensive knowledge
of the ways of men in big cities than he
had when he started.
Miss Pollard and Coler began their
correspondence several months ago, and
when he offered the lady his hand and
the position of mistress of his 200-acre
farm he was accepted and came to
Louisville. An unlucky stop-over in St.
Louis, however, in which he was robbed
of all his money, his coat and hat,
proved his undoing, for when he ar
rived at Miss Pollarde residence with
out the wearing apparel mentioned he
was Indignantly rejected. As the
chance of his winning a bride in Ken
tucky seemed thin, he telegraphed to
Kansas for money and started home.

Russia would accept France's advice,
"because the peace terms will mean

In the meantime th* Japanese army and

Russians plan to abandon the Island

The Russians are strengthening the

Hunchun, northwest of Possiet Bay.x

LONDON, March 30. â What chiefly
ies many aristocratic British
natrons for the grievous disappoint
caused them by the an
cement of the engagement of the
g Marquis of Bute to Miss Au-
BeMngham, an Irish damsel
whom most of them had not even
heard of before, is the fact that It is
; â¢ an American girl who has cut
their daughters. Possessed of an
income of t1.250,00Q a year, eleven
titles of nobility. 120.000 acres, half
a dozen fine castles and palatial coun

â¢ a sound constitution and good

the catch of the season. Many years

Compared with the Butes the Bel
lint'hams are poor â though 6000
ncrea and a castle, even in Ireland, are
pot to be sneezed at â but they are rich
in ancestry. The family goes back in
an unbroken male line to Allan de
Bellingham, a Norman knight who
crossed the channel with William the
OnqVeror. One of the Bellinghams
acted as guide to another William â
mP Orange â in his memorable Irish
campaign, and had Castle Bellingham
btxrnedj down for his pains. That was
before the family had reverted to the
old faith. Miss Bellingham can also
boast some strains of royal blood.
Through her mother, a daughter of
the Earl of Gainsborough â sh? is de
scended from George IV and Mrs.
Jordan. She is also connected with the
ill-starred House of Stuart, her great
aunt. Lady Alice Hay. having mar
ried the mysterious nobleman who
bore the title <fr the Count d'Albani
and was generally believed to be the
last descendant of Bonnie Prince
Charlie. As far as pedigree gÂ»es the
bride-elect is more than a match for
the many-titled Marquis. But the
family hasn't had anything like the
same luck. Similarity of faith has
counted for much in the engagement.

year, that the engagement was settled.
But bo quiet was the affair kept that
not until it was publicly announced a
short time ago did a lot of titled
beauties learn that they had not been
in the running for some months.
FAVORED BY FORTUNE.
No family in the peerage has been
more favored by fortune than the
Butes. "He flourishes in an honor
able ancestry," is the proud motto of
the house, but its vast possessions
were not, ne might be inferred from
this, won by the sword, gained in the
public service or even paid for by
hard earned cash. They are due
chiefly to the fact that the founder of
the family was the illegitimate son of
a KinÂ«, Robert 11 of Scotland. The
Welsh property, with its coal fields
more valuable far than gold mines,
was acquired by marriage. The fore
shores of Cardiff, which with their
huge docks are the source of so much
wealth, were bought from the corpo
ration for an annual dinner which is
no longer given. Things have Just
come the way of these lucky folk and
they have taken them. Now' every
hour of the twenty-four, whether he
hf sleeping or waking, working or
playing, brings the young Marquis in
something like $140.
His affairs are managed by able
hands and he has no need to bother
his head about them. Although an
(xcellent linguist, speaking several
languages, including Russian, fluently,
he iB not a man of marked intellec
tual tastes. He has mingled little in
society and, guarded carefully by his
mother when at home, few girls have
had anything like a fair chance to
catch him. Travel, sport and natural
history are the things that he cares
for most. At present he is somewhere
in Africa hunting and exploring. He
has done some notable things in the
way of big game shooting 1 and in this
respect he differs curiously from his
father, the late Marquis, who never
fired a gun in his life, and though a
splendid business man on occasion
was probably more devoted to his
magnificent library than anything
else. It is a singular instance of the
tricks played by heredity that the
young man who has inherited this
priceless collection cares nothing for
it. He should have been a bibliophile,
yet long before he ha*"d done with his
teens, indeed from quite early boy
hood, he became a naturalist and by
the time he was 15 there was hardly
a bird of the air nor a beast of the
field nor a plant with whose habits
he was not familiar.
The outdoor life to which he is de
voted insures him superb health and
he probably gets more delight out of
nature than his father ever found in
books. For the rest he has the clear
head and keen Judgment of the Scotch
man to guide him safely through life.
Though it is from his Welsh estates
that the bulk of his income comes,
Scotland has by a long way first place
in his affections. He always wears
k;its when there, insists on his at
tendants don. ling the Highland cos
tume and keeps a piper, who wakes
the household at daybreak with the
skirl erf the bagpipes.
The date of the wedding has not yet
been fixed. It goes ? 'thout saying that
it will be a grand one, but it will
scarcely attract the attention that was
bestowed on the marriage of Lord
Bute's father, the "Lothair" of Dis
raeli's romance, whose "going over to
Rome" while he was at Oxford had
caused a prodigious sensation. Lon
don papers devoted whole pages to the
account of the ceremony and the West
ern Mail, published in Cardiff, whooped
it up to the extent of thirty columns.
Andâ irony of ironiesâ Disraeli, who
had satirized the whole crowd, was mie
of the five witnesses who signed the
register. Among the splendid jewels
which the Marquis of those days lav
ished on his bride was a magnificent
diamond tiara with a design in Hebrew
signifying that "A virtuous woman is
a crown to her husband." Right
worthy has shf proved herself of it
and it is understood it will be one of
her wadding gifts to the Irish girl she
hÂ»s chosen for her son's wife.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 1905.
MORGAN SMITH
OCCUPIES CELL
CINCINNATI, March 30.â J. Morgan
Smith and wife were arrested In this
city to-day on a charge of conspiracy
to murder. The arrest was made on a
telegraphic request of District Attor
ney Jerome of New York. "'Nan" Pat
terson, the actress who was twice
put on trial for the murder of Caesar
Young in New York on May 4, 1904, is
charged with consupiracy in the same
connection, new indictments to this ef
fect having been found in New York
to-day.
Smith and his wife left New York
a few months after the murder and
before the beginning of the mistrial,
and for a long time the authorities
were unable to locate them. Smith's
testimony and his identity are consid
ered almost vital to the case against
Miss Patterson. Several weeks ago
a New York detective met Smith in
Montreal, and from that time until the
arrests here to-day this officer has
awaited a favorable time for making
the arrest. He followed the couple,
part of the time as traveling compan
ion, over half the continent, having
made friends with Smith. Smith found
out that he was a detective, but be
lieved that he was after another man.
Detroit, <'leveiand and a number of
Canadian cities were visited. Finally
Smith went to Nashville and Louis
ville in the hope of securing a position
with some of the bookmakers in those
cities, leaving his wife in Cleveland.
He was unsuccessful, and came to Cin
cinnati, where his wife met him on
Wednesday.
DENIED BY RELATIVES.
Mrs. Smith said she had relatives in
Covington, Ky., and she went with her
husband to that city yesterday to call
on these people, who, however, refused
to see the visitors and afterward de
clared that there was no relationship
between them. Returning to this city,
Smith registered at the Grand Hotel
as If. 11. Banning and wife.
The detective had kept in tele
graphic communication with New York
and had deferred the arrest until it
was possible to arrest both, their sep
aration soon after reaching the United
States on returning from Canada hav
ing caused the delay.
The arrest was quietly made. Smith
and his wife were taken to police head
quarters, where they made no attempt
to deny or conceal their identity, al
though both denied any guilt in con
nection with the case. They showed
signs of nervousness and worry, but
both declared rhey would return to
New York without requisition papers,
as they had expected to do, although
they had not anticipated going under
arrest.
The detective who has been follow
ing Smith says that he went under
many aliases in different cities before
registering here as 11. H. Banning. At
Hamilton, Ont., he called himself Bush,
at Montreal he was known as Adams,
at Detroit it was Collins and in Cleve
land Robinson.
THREATENED YOUNG.
NEW YORK, March 30.â The Grand
Jury in this city to-day returned in
dictments against J. Morgan Smith.
Julia Smith (his , wife) and "Nan"
Patterson, charging them jointly with
conspiracy. The indictments are based
on a letter alleged to have been written
by Julia Smith to Caesar Young in
which, it is alleged, was a threat and
a demand for money for the Patterson
girl.
The action by the Grand Jury fol
lowed a hearing at the Criminal
Court's building, at which several wit
nesses, including the widow of Caesar
Young and Mrs. Young's brother-in
law. William Luce, were examined by
Assistant District Attorney Rand, who
conducted the. recent trial of "Nan"
Patterson, charged with Caesar
Young's murder, which resulted in a
disagreement by the jury.
The arrest of Smith and his wife at
Cincinnati, according to the local au
thorities, will have an important bear
ing upon the new trial of the Patter
son girl on the charge of murder, set
for April 10. At a previous trial an at
tempt was made to prove that the re
volver with which^Young was shot was

CHICAGO. March 30.â Conspiracy in

heads of big meat-packing concerns un
less alleged tampering with witnesses
who have been summoned to testify
before the Federal Grand Jury is dis
continued at once. With two witnesses
on the stand to-day who, it is assert
ed, admitted that they had been ap
proached with a suggestion that their
testimony be mild, the jury, it is de
clared, is getting ready to take drastic
action.
"We will shut off interference with
witnesses," said Assistant Attorney
General Pagin to-night, "even if we
have to resort to proceedings under
the conspiracy statute to do so." Be
lief was general to-night that Pagin
has already laid out plans of new in
dictments.
Fifteen witnesses were heard to
day, three women being among those
who testified. The women are said to
be stenographers employed by the Na
tional Packing Company.
The fifteen secret service men who
have been frequenting the corridors in
the building where the Grand Jury is in
session were not to he seen to-day. Dis
trict Attorney Morrison was said to
have ordered that waiting witnesses,
instead of spending their time in the
vicinity of the jury- room, are to be
concealed in downtown hotels until
called before the jury. In this way
the witnesses will be more readily pre
vented from learning the identity of
the secret service men watching for
possible irregularities.

REQUISITION- PAPERS.
A Deputy Sheriff of the District At
torney's office left here to-day for
Albany with requisition papers for
Smith and .his wife, which Governor
Higgins will be asked to sign. As soon
as the Governor's signature is obtained
the deputy will start for Ohio. In ad
dition to the conspiracy charge Smith
is also under indictment for contempt
of court in failing to respond to a sub
pena in the preliminary examination
before the Grand Jury.
"Nan" Patterson had not been in
formed of the arrest of her sister and
brother-in-law up to a late hour.

Methodists are now beginning: to fight

Henry H. Rogers of the Standard Oil
and Amalgamated Copper companies
Is now agitating the Methodist congre

recently burned and Rogers has offered
$1000 toward rebuild' it. The mem
bers of the church are divided over thÂ«
question of accepting the gift and arÂ»
in the midst of a heated discussion
over the propriety of accepting any
Standard Oil funds, owing to- the agi
tation among Congregationalists ove#
the Rockefeller gift.
BOSTON. March 30.â Despite the fact
that the prudential committee of thÂ«
American board of commissioners for
foreign missions has practically de
cided to accept the gift of $100,000 from
John D. Rockefeller to further the
work of the board, a committee repre
senting the Congregational clergymen
of Boston and vicinity, who are op
posed to the acceptance of the gift,
to-day decided to continue the protest.
It was agreed by the members of the
committee that a wide expression of
opinion on the question was desirable,
and for this purpose a committee wai
appointed to submit the facts and doc
uments to the Congregational clergy
man of the country.
The prudential committee will not
take final action on the acceptance of
Rockefeller's gift for two weeks, and it
is the intention of the protesting com
mittee to learn, if possible, the general
feeling among clergymen.

sory nerves, is neuralgia, and
is the "big brother" of all the
other pains.

L.OS ANGELES, March 80.â One of
the heaviest storms of snow and hail
in thÂ»> history ff thin part of the .State
swept over the orange belt to-day, ex
tending from L/Os Angeles on the west
to the mountains east of Riverside and
San Bernardino and giving to Southern
California the first real touch of winter
after a season of unusually mild weath
er and abundant rainfall.
In Riverpid* 3 snow f^li for half an
hour, but except in sheltered places it
melted ac fast as it fell. On some
streets the pavements were covered.
The storm was much more severe in
and about San Bernardino, where snow
fell for nearly two hours, covering the
streets in the city and giving to the
extensive orange groves an icy coating,
which it is frared has caused consider
able damage.
At Pomona this evening snow fell and
drifted in such a quantity that it was
poagtbte to make a sno^ man, the first
ever seen in that city, which is in the
very heart of the orange belt. Children,
hundreds of whom had never seen snow
except on the tops of the distant moun
tains, reveled in it. and no peri<?Â«t-ian
was immune from bombardment with
snowballs while the snow lasted.
The storm was accompanied by a
high wind, and this, with the hail, se
riously damaged many orchards in the
vicinity of San Dinias and Lordsburg,
tli*-' hail knocking off the blossoms from
the treAje
In the mountains the fall of snow was
vary heavy. In BÂ»ar Valley eighteen
Inches fHI durinp last night and this
morning. The snow line extended far
down the mountainside. To-night the
weather throughout the orange region
!? unusually cold, the wind being di
rectly off the snow-covered mountains.
If the wind continues the danger of
damage from frost will not be great,
but if it is followed by a calm there
may he a killing frost in that section.
The temperature at midnight in Los
AnjrMt-s was 47 degrees.
BAKKRS FIELD. March Mlâ A heavy

Hailstorms arc reported from several
outlying districts. Snow has been fall

FLINT TALKS
ON NEW LAWS
LOS ANGELES, March 30. â United
States Senator Frank P. Flint, in an
interview to-day on current public
questions, said regarding the question
of railroad rate regulation, that not a
single member of the United States
Senate, Republican or Democrat, is
opposed to the policy of President
Roosevelt to give the Interstate Com
merce Commission increased power.
On the contrary, he believed that when
the House met in extraordinary ses
sion in October the subject will be diÃ
posed of in short order., and a law
enacted that will be satisfactory to the
public, as well as to the vested inter
ests involved.
Senator Flint said the regular ses
sion of the Senate will undoubtedly
ratify some sort of treaty with Santo
Domingo, although he admits the sub
ject is fraught with considerable dan
ger to the republic, because of the
principles of international law and
phases of the Monroe doctrine that
are involved. The new treaty to be
submitted will not carry certain of the
provisions embodied in the agreement
that failed a few weeks ago, and to
which serious exception was taken by
a majority of tfte members of the Sen
ate.
As far as Arizona statehood is con
cerned, the Senator said he is certain
the Beveridge bill, linking Arizona
and New Mexico and Oklahoma and
Indian Territory into two States, will
be enacted into law by the next Con
gress, although he will cast his vote
for single statehood, as he is pledged.
He is of the opinion that double state
hood, as advocated by Senator Bev
eridge, will become a part of the Re
publican caucus policy in the two
houses, and the contest to bring it
about will not be prolonged.

HENRY J. CROCKER
TAKES HIS SEAT ON
HARBOR COMMISSION
NEW HARBOR COMMISSIONER.
WHO YESTERDAY TOOK HIS
SEAT IN THE BOARD.
The new Harbor Commissioner, Hen
ry J. Crocker, was welcomed to his
place on the board yesterday afternoon.
For the outgoing Commissioner, Colonel
J. C. Klrkpatrlck, there were many
tributes of commendation from his as
sociates. An incident of the. occasion
was the presentation of a gold watch
to Mr. Kirkpatrick. and this was sup
plemented by the gift of an ivory
handled, gold-mounted driving whip.
Later on a few bottles of champagne
were opened, to the delight and surprise
of water front attaches.
When the board was called to order
.the outgoing Commissioner Introduced
his successor in a few appropriate re
marks. In acknowledgment of the in
troduction Mr. Crocker said:
If I am expected to make a speech to you it
Is Indeed a surprise to mÂ«. L.
* I certainly feel It a great honor done me
by th* Governor to be associated with you in
conducting harbor Interests at this time when
the- State has taken such steps for the adop
tion of better facilities for the commerce of
this port and â  to improve the t waterways
and also the harbor, which Is hardly equaled.
No doubt the conduct of this board in spend
ing those 1 funds for the benefit of the harbor
and the. benefit of the State is- something that
will require our united Judgment/ and knowing
m as i do, old acquaintances. I feel that.
I can do what little my knowledge of the
State allows to assist you. This S board is
enabled In a small way to advance the pres
ent conditions of this harbor so. that the State
may make this water front one of the best
of â - its kind. There have been...large sums of
money spent in the old world, in such. places
as Liverpool, for "seawall purposes, but we
never can expect to have the 1 money to make
this harbor what It should be. yet. we will
do what we can/ with what we have in hand,'
for thp future.
COURTESIES EXCHANGED.
Charles H. Spear, president of the â¢
board, spoke in high terms of the ef- \
flciency and business capacity of i
Colonel Kirkpatrick. Addressing the re- |
tiring Commissioner, Mr. Spear said:
You have rendered to this day your best
efforts for the welfare of tbe water front and
1 ran simply add that as one of your col
leagues for the past two years I have no com
plaint, only thoughts of kindness. The office
1p Indeed one of evolution, always changing. It
give? me great pleasure to give testimony of
tbe harmony which has extated in the board,
and as far an the conditions of the water front
are concerned you have always grasped the
situations and aided In the handling of them {
to the State's best interest.
Mr. Crooker will, I have no doubt, fill the
place conscientiously and to the State' s ad- i
vantage.
Responding to the sentiments of good j
will,- Colonel Kirkpatrick remarked: * I
It 'is one of the unfortunate thin** that '
after we have become associated- with men on'
a board of this kind that we must Dart, but
I can assure you that it is not without deep
| regret on my part, yet ' we will continue :to j
i meet in a -business way, having the welfare i
[ and interest of the, State at heart, and I wel
; come Mr. Crocker to the seat' which I have
' occupied. . â¢ , . -
- I will not make much of a statement, .but
i will simply say that It 'la exceedingly kind
! of the president to express bo much regret, .
! and while it is a regretful occurrence in all
' statutory boards, : there ! seems to be | a war
â  rant for that; - Tennyson ' quotes from King
j Arthur's time "the old must give place to the
I new." - 1 hope that' our friendship of the past'
I four years will last many times four years. j
> I thank you very much, . gentlemen, and ,
I leave with a great deal of regret. -â¢-.- I
; The ' board, after v transacting gome j
I business, in which the rent of the new
! quarters for the Key 1 Route was fixed
i at $700 a month, adjourned until next

j mission and office force : was made !by
â¢ Mr. Spear. â In accepting the time
j piece ' the retiring. Commissioner, gave
: his approval of this system of. watch-
Ing oublfc : servants. :
John M. Foy, secretary of the Com
mission, performed the pleasant duty
of presenting the colonel with a riding
whip. On behalf of Mrs. Kirkpatrick

beautiful bouquet of flowers from his
former associates on the board.
Later on In another room Commis- j
sioners Mackenzie, Spear and Crocker
exchanged greetings over the wine with
former Commissioners Ruaolph Herold
and J. C. Kirkpatrick. The remarks
were listened to by the officers and at- j
tachec of the Commission. Special ref- j
erence was made to the vast expendi
ture of public money to improve the
commercial facilities of foreign ports.
It was said that $100,000,000 of public â 
money had been expended on the water j
front of Liverpool. The annual ton- !
nage of Liverpool was slightly in ex
cess of 900,000,000. The tonnage of San
Francisco approximated $50,000,060.
Reference was made to the two new '
piers for the Pacific Mail, which would
cost $400,000, the money for the con- ,
Btructlon has already been paid in by i
the Mail Company. The tolls and dock- :
age for fifteen years would amount to ;
J1.250.000. The speakers, Colonel Kirk- i
Patrick, Rudolph Herold and President j
Spear mentioned that no tax was lev- j
ied on real estate for these vast im- '
provements. It was asserted in em- j
phatic terms that the port charges of |
San Francisco were not high in com- i
parison with charges levied by other :
leading cities.
A toast in honor of Governor Pardee j
was proposed by Henry Crocker, and
all applauded.

SHEEP BUYER
IS MURDERED
Representative of a Packing
Company Meets With Vio
lent Death in Kern County
. BAKERSFIEL.D, March 30.â What is
probably a brutal murder was brought
to light at Delano yesterday by the
finding of the body of J. E. Dunn, a
I prominent sheep buyer for the Cudahy "
Packing Company.. / â .
Dunn made his headquarters in Los
| -Angeles and has a family residing in
that city. He made regular trips to
Kern County sheep camps and was on
â  one of these trips when he met death.
1 .Dunn arrived in Delano Monday and
! spent the night at Zimmerman's ranch..
IHe was in Delano all day Tuesday.
i Yesterday morning he was found dead
iin Jean Eustache's barn. An inquest
; was held. and ; the Jury rendered a ver
j diet ; that' the; deceased came : to .- his
I death by a gunshot wound, but did not
â¢ indicate whether it was a case of mur-
I der' or otherwise. Examination of
i Dunn's body disclosed the fact that he
! met.death from a bullet In the back
1 of the neck at the base of the skull.
I Another bullet entered the: head. -
, The â¢ case' i? surrounded with much
: mystery. - ; . :. ; . ; '.;
! LOS ANGELES March 30. â Harry
Dunn, son of J. Dunn, went, to
, Bakersileld last evening and to-day
telephoned the family that officers had
. secured evidence which might lead to
, the arrest of one or more persons. FTe
j scouted the theory of suicide. It de
i velops that the dead, man's revolver
held one empty shell, and it is believed
he fired the shot in self-defense.:. The
fact of two bullet <â  wounds in the top
; and back of the j head seems to do
away with any suspicion of suicide.
Dunn's family,- consisting- of the
, widow and six children, resides at 721
: Macy street.

TO LONESOME DIVORCEE.
TWO DRINKS DEPRIVE HER OF SENSE
biie Performs a Dervish Dance and Tries to
Kick Out a Sidewalk Light.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Mrs. Loretta Johnson, , buxom and
passing comely, informed Police Judge
Fritz that never again would sh,e go
slumming. Indeed, the idea of touring
the red light district did not enter her
mind until It was planted there by two
gentlemen friends who, called at her
apartment, on Folsom street; near
Tenth, and proposed the excursion,
with apparent Intent to lighten her
lonesomeness. occasioned by newly ac
quired grass widowhood. She quoted
cr.e of them as saying to her:
"Cheer up. kiddo; stack on some duds
an' we 11 go down an' hit de high places
in de tenderloin."
With ro premonition of 111 she donned
her picture hat and loose whit* coat
sn<l sallied forth as invited. After vis-
siting two concert halls on O'Farrell
istreet and consuming one drink in each
of them her mentality must have gone
awry, for she had bo recollection what
ever of committing the silly offenses al
leged against her by Patrolmen Hurd
and Pearl. If she really did attempt to
perform a dervish dance upon a public
sidewalk she must have been prompted
by emulative spirit, as she knew that
su< li a Terpsiehorean whirl was one of
the hits she had witnessed in a free-to
enter and eostly-to-exir theater ere her
brain became chaotic. As for trying to
ki;k an elertric light lamp several feet
higher in 'the air than her head, she
uiu'st have- .been induced to do so- by
lier masculine escort, fcr she was too
etout to be saltatorially inclined when
possessed if her proper senses, and she
was ashamed to think of the absurd
figure she must have cut. No. she did
not remember saying to Patrolman
Hurd. "Aw, gwan an' stop yer kiddin,
kid,*" nor of ogling Patrolman Pearl
and remarking. "Say, kid. ye look good
to me." In brief, memory failed to en
lighten her as to anything she said or
did between the time of taking her
second drink and awakening to find
herself in a prison celL Nor would she
like to even imagine that drink No. 2
was "doped." She would rather believe
that a life of almost total abstinence ,
had made her exceptionally susceptible
to the influence of intoxicating liquor.
As her male companions escaped ar
id as the two policemen thought
'hat phe had already been sufficiently
punished for her Indiscretion, an order
was issued by the bench.

Abraham Schwartz, carpenter, and

two. first nipt and Instantly admired
each other in Golden Gate Park, and
the acquaintanceship thus inaugurat
ed quickly ripened into ardent affec
tion on the part of Abraham and ap
parently was developing into love on
the part of Sarah when she abruptly
dashed his hopes by informing him
that he must cease to visit her, inas
much as one who held prior claim to
her exclusive esteem had unexpectedly
returned from the East and was
strenuously pressing his suit. For a
while Abraham obediently shunned
the home of Sarah at 219 V 4 Harriet
street, but finally his will succumbed
to his adoration and he haunted the
house of his inamorata and tapped at
her chamber window and knocked at
her front door, very much to her cha
grin and alarm. But not until he forced
entrance to her apartment and, pisol
in hand, threatened to provide ma
terial for a double inquest if she did
not promise to be his and his alone,
did she seek police protection. She
dashed out o' doors and summoned a
patrolman, who returned to the house
with her and found Abraham in h-*r
room and his pistol in a bureau
drawer.
When the bald facts of the case
were unfolded to Judge Cabaniss he
ordered that Abraham be charged
with threats against life as well as
disturbing the peace an dthat he be
detained in custody until the court
has more time to devote to the hear
ing of details.

longer lapses between your arrests.
Twice a week would suffice to cap

Albert Dougherty and Louis Bahr,
typical vagabonds. sought shelter
from a midday shower and found it
underneath some trees on a hillside
far, out McAllister street. As they
stood watching the raindrops patter
there came along the sidewalk below
a handsome and well dressed woman,
who glanced up at them as she passed
and then stopped, took a handker-
chief from her reticule and flourished
it
"She's flagrgin' me," Bald Mr. Dough
erty to his companion. Â
"It's me she's handin' de corne

Bahr.
Then gathering up their tatters, the
two sons of rest nimbly slid down the
declivity and ran after the lady, who
took to her heels when she heard their
footsteps and glanced around.
"W'y dcn't yer drop out o' this
eprint?" panted Mr. Dougherty to Mr.
Bahr. "Don't yer see she wants ter
shake ye?**
"It's youse she wants ter give de
fare-ye-welj to," gasped Mr. Bahr.
Another glance over her shoulder
convinced the fair quarry that her
pursuers were rapidly closing the gap,
and to their dismay she spurted and
loudly yelled as she ran:
"Po-leece! Help! Robbers! Help!
Thieves! Help! Kidnapers! Help!
Burglars! Help!"
Her cries were heard by Patrolman
Gaston, who dashed to the rescue and
captured the creators of her alarm.
"What are you chasing the lady for?'"
inquired the officer.
"Wot did she wave de rag at me
for?" was Mr. Doughertys counter
query.
"W'y did she give me de mash Btgn?"
asked Mr. Bahr.
When the female recovered her
breath she explained that she was re
turning from her milliner's and wear-
Ing a dream of an Easter hat to sub
mit for her husband's Inspection when
the rain suddenly descended, and it
was to protect her precious headgear
that she took the handkerchief from
her handbag and shook it aloft to
loosen its folds. The Impudence of
Messrs. Dougherty and Bahr in sup
posing that she signaled to either or
both of them to follow her was more
than she could understand
Judge Conlan also expressed amaze
ment at the self-conceit shown by the
two unprepossessing figures before him.
He pronounced them guilty of vag
rancy and deplored the reluctance of
she whom they had pursued to appear
in court and his resultant deprivation
of opportunity to punish them for

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY. MARCH 31. 1905.
BURGLARY CASE
FLATTENS OUT
Report of Alleged Theft of
Jewelry Worth Nearly
$1700 Is Denied Later
QUEER LOOK TO MATTER
August Portal and Fiancee,
Mrs. L. Badere, Repudiate
Tale Accredited to Them
August Portal, who tends bar at
Sixth and Folsom streets, and Mrs.
Laura Badere, who conducts a small
dyeing and repairing shop on Mont
gomery avenue, have for some ' time
been engaged to wed, and, it is said,
intended to have the ceremony per
formed during the latter part of April
and depart at once for France, their
native country. Mrs. Badere occupies
a room in the building at 323 Montgom
ery avenue, next to her place of busi
ness.
Wednesday evening Portal stopped
Policeman Thomas O'Connell, whose
beat is on the avenue, and told him ha
had just been in Mrs. Badere's room,
and that a burglar had been there and
ransacked all the drawers. Mrs. Badere
was notified, and she hurried to the
room and found everything in great
disorder. She said the following ar
ticles of value were missing: One pair
of diamond earrings, worth $600; breast
pin containing eleven diamonds, $500;
two diamond rings, $500; wedding ring,
$7; lady's gold watch, $25; six silver
teaspoons, $15; two revolvers, $10; coin,
$17 50. Entrance had been effected
through the door of the room.
This report is according to a state
ment filed with Acting Chief Spillane
by Policeman O'Connell.
Portal and Mrs. Badere promised to
appear before Captain of Detectives
Burnett yesterday morning and give
further details of the alleged burglary.
They did not appear. Inquiries of Mrs.
Badere elicited the startling statement
that nothing had been stolen from her
room and that she had not reported
any robbery. From Portal came sim
ilar statements. He declared he had
nc-ver reported that there had been a
burglary. The woman seemed in an
excited frame of mind; the man wore
a sheepish look.
The landlady at 32" Montgomery ave
nue said she had not heard of any
burglary having taken place in the
house.
The denials of the pair, taken in con
junction with the report of the po
liceman, make a peculiar state of af
fairs. Portal has been keeping com
pany with Mrs. Badere for about four
months. Her husband died last year,
and, it is said, left her a little money.
She was nnt known to have such val
uable jewelry.
The couple were together in the dye-
Ing shop yesterday and seemed on
friendly terms, though the lady was
very sharp in telling him not to talk
when he essayed to answer questions
concerning the alleged burglary.
Epplnger Demurrers Disallowed.
Judge Lawlor yesterday disallowed
the demurrers interposed to the in
dictments charging- Jacob, Herman
and Josua Epplnger and James Dem
inge with obtaining money by false
pretenses. The cases were continued
till April 8 to be set for trial. It is
expected that the trial will not be held
till May owing to the absence from
the city of ex-Governor Budd, one of
the counsel for defendants, and At
torney J. C. Campbell, special pros
ecutor.

decree has been made final, so you

"But," said Judge Mogan, "you
cannot reasonably expect these com
plainants to pay for the food and
lodging of a man whom you Intro
duced to them as your husband."
"Well, he wasn't my husband then
and he ain't my husband now, and I
won't pay his debts," snapped Mrs.
Kelson.
"Then you cannot get your personal
effects by order of this court," said
the Judge.
Peter Albert, a peddler of matches,
beat with a heavy cane a printer's ap
prentice named Nathan Ferroggiaro

trolman J. P. Walsh experienced con
siderable difficulty in saving Mr. Al
bert from violent treatment at the
hands of a crowd that witnessed the
assault. Judge Mogan will sentence
Mr. Albert for battery.
Peter Miller, a stockily built Teu
ton, disturbed a revival meeting at
Pine and Kearny streets by bellowing
the melody of "Killarney" while the
worshipers were singing In unison,
"Hold the Fort." Judge Conlan pro
nounced him guilty of disturbing the
peace.
John H. Pass, an ironworker, was
drunk when he sauntered into the Em
porium, deliberately smashed twelve
large glass vases therein displayed for
sale, and violently 'resisted Captain
Callundan of the Morse Detective

arrest him. Malicious mischief and dis
turbance of the peace proven before
Judge Mogan, who reserved sentence.

Angel Soto, a barber, waxed so dis

ly berated 'â Mr. Mule, who alleged
that his case was hurt by the incident.

founded to reproach Mr. Mule for in
jratitude.

THIRD TRIAIi OF SUIT
AGAINST THE RAILROAD
James C. Cavin Again Trying to Re-
cover Damages for Personal
Injuries.
The third trial of the case of James
C. Cavin vs. the Southern Pacific
Company is In progress In the United
States Circuit Court before a jury,
with United States District Judge de
Haven presiding in the absence of
United States Circuit Judge Morrow.
Cavin was a railway mail carrier and
in February, 1901, the train on which
he was riding was ditched in a cul
vert where the track had been wash
ed away by a cloudburst.
Cavin alleges that he sustained se
rious personal injuries and sued to
recover $60,000. The jury on the first
trial disagreed. On the second trial
the jury by order of the court brought
in a verdict for the defendant. This
judgment was reversed on appeal and
the case has gone to the third trial.

SAYS MCGILVRAY
BROKE CONTRACT
William J. Dlngee, executor of the
will of the late Alvlnza Hayward, al
leges that he was taken advantage of
by John D. McGilvray relative to the
sale of property at Bay and Dupont
streets belonging to the estate of the
deceased millionaire. Dlngee filed suit
yesterday against McGilvray and
James McNab, who plaintiff says he
believes has an interest In the trans
action, to set aside a deed to the prop
erty in question.
IJMngee says that in accordance with
an^rder of court he offered the prop
erty In question for sale and McGilvray
bid $121,000 for the same Subsequent
ly, but before the sale was confirmed
by the court, Dingee says that William
A. McGee came to him and told him
that he could get a better price for the
land and would guarantee him $125,000
net. Dingee then went to McGilvray,
he says, and laid the proposition before
him and said that in view of the in
creased price offered he would ask the
court not to confirm the sale of the
property on the bid of 5121,000.
McGilvray, Dingee alleges, requested
him to let the matter stand and he
would pay him the $4000 additional.
This Dingee says he did, the sale of
the property was confirmed to McGil
vray and he was given a deed. But,
says Dingee In conclusion, after the
confirmation McGilvray refused to pay
any greater sum than $121,000 and it
was through inadvertence that the
deed was given to him before he had
first lived up to his agreement. Hence
he asks that the deed be canceled and
that he be authorized to return to Mc-
Gilvray the $121,000 received from him
in payment for the property.

STILL FIGHTING
HIS BLIND SON
Peter Bacigalupl is still fighting in
the courts in an effort to avoid contrib
uting toward the support of his blind
son, Lucien P. Bacigalupi. Yesterday
morning his counsel appeared before
Judge Hebbard and made the plea
that the blind son was barred from
suing his parent for support, as he is
now of age and consequently depend
ent upon himself alone, for support.
The son's only remedy, it was argued,
was to become a charge upon the
county and then see that the county
brought action against his father for
the cost of his maintenance.
"It is my opinion." said Judge" Heb
bard, "that a moral obligation at least
rests upon the father of this plaintiff.
It is my opinion that a similar cafe
was up before Judge Seawell for ad
judication and that he decided in favor
of the claimant. Before I decide this
case I will give counsel for the claim
ant opportunity to search for this au
thority."
The case was continued for further
hearing in accordance with this ruling.
Lucien P. Bacigalupi is now 25 years
of age. He has b- n blind ever since
he was 3 years old, and in view of this
infirmity is unable to earn his living

LIGHTED CANDLE
AIDS SUICIDE.
Old Lady Turns on Gas to End
Life and Explosion Follows.
Was Doubly Sure That Death Would Ensue
BERKELEY, March 30.â Mr?. Annie
If. Shermer made the assurance of
death doubly sure yesterday afternoon.
but she did it inadvertently. The old
lady, for she was several years over
the allotted three score and ten, turned
on the gas at her home, 2223 Chapel
street, with suicidal intent, and she
also left a lighted candle burning at
her bedside.
Asphyxiation, followed by severe
barm from an explosion, were the re
sult of the old lady's preparation to end
her existence.
Mr?. M. Newsom, who lives in a house
adjoining that which was occupied by
Mrs. Shermer, heard an explosion at 6
o'clock this morning. Mrs. Newsom
pai'i no particular attention to the
noise, but was startled on seeing (lames
issuing from the Shermer home. "With
the assistance of C. H. Mace and Mabel
Weed, neighbors, Mrs. Newsom sub
dued the flames.
Mrs. Shermer was found with her
head wrapped in a blanket, partially
burned. The gas tube had been insert
ed in her mouth when asphyxiation
was planned. The candle by the bed
was still burning. The furniture of the
room was partially destroyed.
The old lady had written a note, in
which she told of her despondency and
lonclfncnn She directed that various ar
ticles of furniture be given to friends
and neighbors. The paper was charred
n that some of its contents could not
be deciphered.
Mrs. Shermer had resided alone in the
â  >>ttage for two years. She was 76
years old. Her brother. Joshua "Cole.
resides at 2033 Charming way. Mrs.
Bhenner was a native of Jersey, where
h<=r husband was for many years a
Baptist minister.
GYPSIES WAR
OVER OUTFIT
'AKLAND. March 30.â Officerp of
the law have been called upon to in
terfere in a family feud of Austrian
gypsies, which has once caused the
haling of ane of the dark-skinned wan
derers into court, and now nas reached
the stage of father against son in the
warfare. Involved is a woman, Mary
Stanley, a queen of the quarreling
tribesmen. On one side is Michel Stan
ley and the woman's first husband,
Materio Bonavlch. Frank Stanley, the
successor to Bonavich at the tribal
throne, is the center of attack.
Michel Stanley, a swarthy gypsy,
typical in bis lemg black hair and pic
turesque attire, is -battling with hlB
son Frank for the possession of a valu
able traveling outfit, consisting of a
large and finely equipped caravansary
on wheels, a span of horses and all
of the incidental equipment. Unable to
recover the outfit, which he asserts he
merely l^nt to his son fcr a year, the
time having expired, Michel resorted
to the courts. To-day he swore to a
si-arch warrant, which the police served
on the son this afternoon. The con
test will be settled in the Police Court.
Thr- father declares his son's wife is
trying to get possession of the team. .
â He is only a boy, 24 years old," said
the gypsy father. "The woman has
him under her control, hypnotized. I
would help my son all in my power,
but I do not want the woman to get
my property. I want no money frcrm
him, but I fear he will leave with the
outfit and I shall never see it again."
The son's wife has been conducting
an encampment oh Broadway, near
Second street, where the team in dis
pute is a part of the paraphernalia.
The father's camp is on the San Lean
dro road. With him is Meterio Bona
vuh, husband No. 1. A month ago
Bonavich was arrested on complaint of
his former wife and charged with ab
ducting five of his own children. Bon
avich was discharged after a hearing
in court. He declared his children
wanted to be with him rather than
to go with their mother. Stanley,
father, took Bonavich under his wing.
Hence some of the troubles.

FIRE CHEATED
OF ITS SPOIL
Children Are Rescued From
Locked House as Flames
Threaten to Destroy Them
BERKELEY, March 80. â The two
children of James Tate. of 2022 Dela
ware street, escaped death by inciner
ation this morning. Their mother
fainted when the little tots were res
cued from their perilous plight. Sadie
and Johnnie Tate were left by their
parents in the Tate residence this
morning, while the father and mother
went about their respective duties. The
house was locked to prevent the chil
dren from wandering away. While
the parents were absent the house
caught fire, the little ones fled from
room to room to escape the fast-mov
ing flames, and when the fire seemed
to have enveloped them succor came.
The cottage and all its contents were
destroyed.
Mrs. Tate arrived in time to see
neighbors break in the doors and
grasp Sadie and Johnny just as the
flames were searing their clothes. The
youngsters could not say how the fire
started. It had its origin in the kitch
en. The terrified children watched its
progress, and after trying in vain to
get out ran to the attic window and
there Johnny held Sadie in his arms
and yelled lustily for help. Neighbors
hurried to the spot, and there discov
ered the youngsters' peril.
Ready hands broke in the door and
egress was secured for the little ones.
When Mrs. Tate came, her children,
with clothes burned, sobbing bitterly,
were being comforted by the rescuers.
With a realization of the miraculous
escape from a horrible death her off
spring had just experienced, Mrs. Tate
fainted, ajid then the entire Tate fam
ily was cared for at a house in the
neighborhood.
SOCIETY FOLK
PREPARING FOR
SUMMER HEGIRA
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND. March 30.â "1n the soring a
youn* man's fancy lightly turni to thoughts
of love." but the thoughts of the society girl
generally stray in tome other direction. When
the sun climbs toward the zenith and the
earth dons ltÂ» robe of tender green, nilladi be
gins to dream of the annual flitting to foreat
or seaside and there Is a grand Â»klrmiÂ»h for
the indispensable dressmaker. It was a k|nd
Providence that arranged the lenten season be
tween the winter's strenuous pleasures and the
merry vacation time. It gives the butterfly a
needed period of rest, in which to preen her
gay wings for the summer undoing of that
same young man. who "dreamed of love"
while a dressmaker was prosaically preparing
the "sinews of war."
It takes careful consideration; too, Jor the
summer girl to decide where to spend those
days of dolre far nlente, that she may make or
brvak her future fortune*, for It la in the vaca
tion days that Cupid Is most active. If she
is athletic and looks well in outing costume,
Bh"e hies her to some mountain renort or
"roughs it in some pleasant valley." but if
she is attractive only in dainty, fluffy gowns
or beneath the becoming curves of a pictur
esque sunshade she seeks the seaside or other
watering place hotels, where one may keep
cool and freshlooklng.
Last year Oakland society folk came and
went In the most fitful mannerâ a few days
here, a week there and a little rot at home
In between. One never knew whether one'Â»
friends were In towri or out. It begins to look
as If we might expect the. same restless flit

HUSBAND TRIES

Fires Five Shots From a Re
volver at Spouse, but Only
Inflicts a Slight Wound
QUARREL OVER DIVORCE
Woman Refuses to Return
and Live With Man Whom
She Charged With Cruelty
OAKLAND, March 30.â Bad aim on
the part of N. J. Peterson, a telephone
company lineman, saved the life of
Annie Peterson, his wife, to-night
when the enraged husband fired five
shots at his spouse, because she had
refused to return to live with him after
suing Peterson for a divorce. Only one
of the bullets took effect, inflicting: a
slight wound In Mrs. Peterson's wrist.
The shooting occurred at 877 Twenty
second street, the residence of Deputy
Constable George Green, next door to
the Peterson home. Mrs. Peterson had
gone there to avoid her husband, who
was looking for his wife. Finding her
there at 6:30 o'clock," Peterson urged
her to have a talk with him. She con
sented and the couple met in the front
parlor.
While Peterson was trying to get his
wife to withdraw the divorce suit she
filed last week, he became ansrered at
her persistent refusals. Suddenly he
drew a revolver and began to Bhoot,
Mrs. Peterson screamed for helD and
tried to run out of the room. Green,
who was at the rear of the house,
heard the shots and rushed to the
rescue, getting his pistol from a
bureau drawer. Green broke in UDon
Peterson, leveled his weapon at the
murderous linesman's head and com
manded:
"Drop that gun!"
Peterson obeyed the officer's order
and was placed under arrest, being
sent to the City Prison. He was locked
up after sullenly refusing to talk about
the shooting. Mrs. Peterson was eiven
medical attention and returned to her
home.
The Petersons were married in 1897.
In her suit the wife charged that her
spouse was guilty of extreme cruelty,
habitual intemperance and had failed
to properly support her. Peterson is 41
years old. His emptied pistol was
turned over to the police.

POPUIjATIOX IS GROWING.
There is no question in my mind that Cali
fornia will seme time contain a larger num
ber of people than any other State in the
Union. Whether that great eves* will be seen
by the present or future generation depends
altogether on the enterprise of the people of
this city. As the State grows the city will
grow in proportion, and when this State will
Fiirpaw in population any other State of the
Union San Francisco will then be one of the
larpest citie? in the United States.

A GOOD DEAL OF NONSENSE
About "Blood Purifiers" and "Tonics."
Every drop of blood, every bone,
nerve and tissue in the body can be
renewed in but one way. and that is.
from wholesome food properly digest-
ed. . There is no other way and the idea
that a medicine In itself can purify the
blood or supply new tissues and strong
nerves m ridiculous and on a par with
the fol-de-rol that dyspepsia or indi-
gestion is a germ disease, or that other
fallacy, that a weak stomach which re-
â¢ fuses to digest food can be made to do
fo by irritating and inflaming the bow-
els by pills and cathartics.
art's Dyspepsia Tablets cure In-
digestion, sour stomach, gas and bloat-
ing after meals, because they furnish
the digestive principles which weak
stomachs lack, and, unless the â  defi-
ciency cf pepsin and diastase is sup-
plied. It is useless to attempt to cure
stomach trouble by the use of â¢â ton-
ics," "pills" and "cathartics" which
have absolutely no digestive power,
end their only effect is to give a tem-
porary stimulation.
One grain of the active principle in
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest
3COO grain* of meat, eggs and similar
foods, and experiments have shown
I â¢ rat they will do this in a glass bot-
tle at proper temperature, but of
course are much more effective in the
stomach.
There Is probably no remedy so uni-
versally used as Stuart's Tablets, be-
cause it is not only the sick and ailing,
but well people who use them at every
meal to Insure perfect digestion and
assimilation of food.
People who enjoy fair health take
Stuart's Tablets as regularly as they
take their meals, because they want to
keep well, prevention is better than
cure, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
do both; they prevent indigestion and
I hey remove it where It exists. The
regular use of one or two of them after
:->eals will demonstrate their merit and
efficiency better than any other argu-
ment^

PUBLIC GENEROUSLY RESPONDS TO
APPEAL OF THE INFANTS' SHELTER
Society Lends a Willing Hand, While Fair Maids Wait Upon Table
Middle West. It at one* inspires an interest
â¢o pronounced a* to be extremely gratifying
to or.c looking for the further development
of the State. During the early part of the pres
ent month I spent ten days in Chicago as rep
resentative of the State publicity committee of
the California Promotion Committee, giving
by cpeclal invitation twenty-three illustrated
talks on San Francisco and other California
cities, in connection irith the International
Loan Exhibition held under the auspices of
the '."hieaÂ«o Municipal Museum. The many
pictures shown daily sufficed to give San
Francisco a prominence In the exhibition
which no other city attained, people coming
apain and again to see and hear of the city
by the Golden Gate.
I tell you. my friends, the j>;ople of the
East are interested in California. They are
looking this way with an eagerness which they
make no effort to disguise and It will not be
difficult to induce many of them to locate
here. ThÂ« crowded condition* which prevail
In the great cities and more especially the
severity of the Eastern winters are caua'.ng
thousands of people to think seriously of mak
ing a change of location.
THE EAST IS INTERESTED.
"What is more natural than that they should
t';ra their eyes toward this favored land,
Â«herÂ» under our summer sun the fruits of
the tropics ripen, unaccompanied by the dis
â¢.s of the tcrrld Â«ohe; here the brown
of cur *ummÂ»r hills and the golden stubble
aft<r-harvest are the only winter we
know: where a spring like verdure is the
harbinger of the coming autumn and the
ai'tumn is attended by no forewarning of the
Weak rigors of winter; where winter is the
season when the warm brown earth is turned
by the plow for seedtime, and spring, with
â¢vÂ»rs and ripening grain. Is opulent with
the prophecy of hopeful industry. Surely Cal-

It is the a!m and Intention of the Promotion

Industrie* of California, as well as the physi
cal features of every section of the State. For
taateJMCe, before a community whose Interests
are centered in dairying an entire evening can

doing in that line. In like manner fruit

JURY IMPANELED TO TRY
CASE OF A. A. KRATZ
Man Who Fled to Mexico Will Soon
Be Tried on Charge of Em
bezzlement.
A jury was impaneled in Judge
Dunne's court yesterday to try the
case of A. A. Krati on a charge of
felony embezzlement. The examina
tion of the witnesses will be com
menced this morning. Kratz's brother
William was vice president of the
Donandt-Kratz Company, commission
agents, and on February 13, 1903,
William collected about $18,000 and
disappeared with the coin. The de
fendant was with him at the time.
William was arrested In Kansas City,
where he was living under an as
sumed name. He was brought back,
tried and convicted and sentenced to
serve five years in San Quentin.
A. A. Kratz was out on $10,000
bonds waiting* trial. Last September
it was reported that he had been
drowned while bathing at Long
Beach, but Judge Dunne did not be
lieve the reports, although supported
by affidavits, and forfeited Kratz's
bonds, ordering a bench warrant for
his arrest. Subsequently he was ar
rested in Mexico and brought back
by Detective T. B. Gibson.
SAYS THERE WILL BE NO
CONFLICT OF AUTHORITY
Secretary liermen of Yosemlte Com
mission Declares Soldiers May
Now Camp Wbere They Please.
J. J. Lermen, secretary of the Yo
semitc Commission, says there 1b no
longer any conflict between the State
and military authorities over the
question as to where the army guard
shall camp in the reservation this
year. The Commission claims that
the Dark is still under the supervision
of the State authorities until the Na
tional Government shall have accept
ed the re-ceeslon, but the army people
think the Yosemlte Is already under
Federal control. Attorney General
Webb has been called upon to settle
the difficulty.
Meanwhile the guard under Captain
Benson will proceed to 'the valley and
camp where it may deem best. The
troop* assigned to the duty are a
number of members of the Fourth
Cavalry- Mr. Lermen says he has
discussed the matter with Captain
Benson In a thoroughly friendly ipirit
and that there wtll be no further fric-
tlon between the Commission and the
army on any topic whatever.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 190&
SCENE IN YOUNG'S RESTAURANT YESTERDAY EVENING, WHEN DINNER
WAS SERVED BY A CORPS OF SOCIETY MAIDS AND MATRONS FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE INFANTS' SHELTER.
Fashion and philanthropy, congenial
ly amalgamated, invaded and held
sway through the scheduled working
hours yesterday in Youngs restaurant
on Market street. Women of means,
position and kind hearts lent their
services, monetary and practical, with
as much, unreserve as those accus
tomed to the walks of workaday life.
The Infants' Shelter, soliciting and
eliciting the sympathy and aid of the
public, finds itself to-day wonderfully
bettered by the efforts and attention
of the past twenty-four hours.
The object and achievements of the
Shelter, while known to some extent,
will bear a word further of explana
tion.
Babes and little ones, destitute or
insufficiently cared for, find attention
and comfort at the Shelter. Many
times they have parents who are nat
ural and dutiful, but whose circum
stances do not admit of proper care to
their offspring. In this event the little
folk are given a home at the Shelter
until their rightful homes are provi
dent.
Yesterday's affair bore all the
marks of a society function, so far as
beauty of surrounding could indicate.
Flowers, varied, beautiful and in
quantity, adorned the entrance to the
restaurant. Roses, carnations, can
aryenthus, boughsâ all lent their at
traction of hue and fragrance. Forty
four tables, with snowy linen and pol
ished accouterments, were constantly
in use, and an afternoon tea might
have been in progress to judge from
numbers and chatter of genuine,
wide-awake interest.
At 6 p. m. the doors were closed
for an hour to allow of uninterrupt
ed preparation for dinner, which be
gan at 7:30. Menus, a la carte, had
been offered before this hour, when
table d'hote began. Long before
noon every table had been engaged,
bo that many who expected dining in
behalf of the Shelter were barred out
upon arrival.
The sight of so many dinner par
ties was animating and extremely
gratifying, not alone to the eye â â 
pretty as was the . seene â for the
financial result was also in considera
tion.
Added to this was the flitting about
of society maids and matrons in their
newly assumed roles of waitresses,
aptitude and discretion characterizing
their duties. Among them were Miss
Ida Carmany, Miss Susie McNab and
Miss Alicia B. Mills.
Those who engaged tables and enter
tained guests were Mrs. J. T. Dare,
Mrs. A. W. Scott, Mrs. Thomas Grant,
Mrs. E. B. Cutter, Mrs. J. R. Hannify,
Mrs. Charles Goodall, Mrs. George M.
Perlne, Mrs. J. G. MacKinley, Mrs. C.

Mrs. Whipple and the Misses Ferris.
Music by Rubinstein's orchestra enliv
ened the occasion.
Mrs. Herbert E. Law, who is one of
the earnest patronesses, was obliged to
relinquish her table owing to a family
bereavement. The Shelter will benefit
by nearly $1000 from yesterday's enter
prise.

SUE CALIFORNIA
OIL PROMOTER
Special Dispatch to The Can
HARTFORD, Conn., March 30.âLa
fayette E. Pike of this city, lately In
terested as a broker in mining and oil
investments, has been made defendant
In a suit for $100,000, brought against
him by the directors of the Eastern
Consolidated Oil Company, with head
quarters in Cincinnati and properties lit
the Santa Barbara County fields in
California.
It is alleged that Pike has made no
settlement, as fiscal agent of the com
pany, of money in his possession since
the company's organization in 1901. It
is claimed that several thousand shares
have been sold by Pike, for which he
has made no return to the company.
Major E. Henry Hyde, counsel fur the
plaintiffs, says there is a balance of be
tween $60,000 and $70,000 due from Pike.
The company does not intimate any
criminal intent or defalcation on Pike's
part.
The company was organized in April.
1901, under the laws of Maine.
Pike makes light of the suit and says
that it was brought at this time, just
a week before the annual meeting in
Portland, to discredit him with the
company and secure revocation of
proxies, which he holds for nearly
3,000,000 shares.
Against the Conservative life.
A sftn exceeding $14,000,000 Is annual
ly sent out of California in life insur
ance premiums. The California Company
tends to reverse this movement. Against
the Conservative Life the feeling: is
naturally strong among those whose
business it is to celleet the $14,000,000. â¢

ELK ESCAPES
FROM A CAGE
Margaret, Popular Park Den
izen, Creates Excitement
in the Mechanics' Pavilion
LASSOED BY KEEPER
Beautiful Animal Will Be
a Feature of Forest and
Game Association Display
There have been many mad scenes of
excitement at Mechanics' Pavilion sine*
the carpenters finished battening on the
outside boards of the great structure,
but none that has equaled in Intensity
the arrival yesterday afternoon of Mar
garet, a cow elk from Golden Gate
Park, who is destined as an attraction
tor the exhibit now being prepared for
the Pacific â  Coast Forest, i>Msh and
Game Association. Margaret was se
lected because of her tractable disposi
tion â "sweet, pale Margaret," her keep
er calls her out at the park, because
she is so gentle.
Her removal began in the morning,
when a stout crate was backed up to
the elk corral and she was induced to
enter it. This was loaded Into a huge
van and the journey was made to the
Pavilion without misgivings, except on
the part of Margaret. Scenes unfa
miliar to her, either on the grassy
stretches of the Dark or on her plains
and hills of Saskatchewan, worked on
her nerves. She was overwrought when
she reached the Pavilion.
There a chute had been erected from
the Larkin street entrance, such as the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad
used to build for rustic Arkansans
when they intended to emigrate to
Texas, so they would not be afraid to
get on the train. Margaret was started
down the chute all right into a forty
foot pen built for her. The pen was
sheathed in heavy wire eight feet high,
and above that was a tangle of lighter
wire. Margaret struck the bottom of
the chute, and then she arose, like
Professor Montgomery's aeroplane, and
went through that wire as though it
was a custard pie. She landed out in
the middle of the main floor. Imme
diately there was a cry:
"The elk's out!"
A disinterested and unexclted ob
server, who watched the subsequent
proceedings from an electric light wire,
said he had seen nearly every good ac
robatic team that hari performed in
public for the last ten years, but he
had never witnessed such exhibitions of
alacrity before as were displayed by
the two hundred or more attaches pres
ent. They went up the walls like flies
and hung suspended from girders, win
dow sashes and studboards as though
they liked their positions.
In the meantime the elk had disap
peared and nobody knew where she
was. At the end of the Pavilion hung a
cage containing "old Dick," a crow be
longing to Tom Ferguson, the Market
street saloon-keeper. The crow is as
verbose as a District Judge and can
be as fully biting in his remarks. When
Margaret rushed up the floor and
slipped under his cage he gave vent to
a series of remarks which if translated
from crow language would probably
not look well in print. This was the
first clew to Margaret's whereabouts.
The searchers slid- along the sides of
the building and sighted the elk lying
on the floor. She saw them about the
same time, and jumping to her feet she
made a leap to the music stand and
from there clear over the railing of the
first gallery, where she fell again and
rested. Her keeper climbed a pillar and
took a hitch on her head with a riata.
Others came and tied her hind and fore
logs. Then she v, as packed and dragged
back to her pen, where the wiremen
went to work to construct a barricade
that will hold her for a while.
Dr. d'Evelyn, who is in charge of the
bird and animal exhibit, was an inter
ested and perspiring witness to the en
tire'performance. When it was over he
mopped his brow and said:
"It's a mighty lucky thing that the
accident of birth made that elk a cow
Instead of a bull."

OUR FRIEND THE HEN.
IT iÂ« said that a Frenchman has invented an artificial egg, white,
yolk and all, containing all of the chemical elements of the
genuine article. This inventor should not cackle too soon nor
too loudly, for his manufactured egg will not hatch, at least not
until he gets the biologist, Professor Loeb, to put into it some mys
terious medicine that will give it the life germ, and even then what
assurance is there that it will hatch a chicken?
We think that cooks and egg-eaters will continue, in spite of
This invention, to depend on our friend the hen and that she cannot
be put out of business by a chemical compound of alkali, albumen
and sulphur.
There is hardly any subject of greater economic interest to
California than the hen and her products. The current annual re
port of the State Board of Trade calls attention to the increasing
importation of poultry and eggs from the East. There are "special
chicken cars on the overland routes that brings tens of thousands of
fowls here to supply a demand that- is not met by local production.
Eggs come by the million every year. No capons are produced in
this State, and for that delicacy we depend entirely upon a Misson
rian near Kansas City, . who sends the frozen birds to our local
dealers.
In order to understand the affluence of the Eastern poxiltry and
pply it is necessary to know the conditions of its production.
icre all efforts to make the local supply equal to the demand are
â a<le in exclusive chicken ranches, where nothing else is raised.
The agitation of the subject every year leads mistaken people to
nibark in exclusive poultry raising, and their ventures are almost
nly failures and end in losses, except at Petaluma, where
â¢i raising: is a pro6table art.
In the Hast chicken farming", as an exclusive occupation, is al
mknown. The business is a side issue on every farm in Ne
braska and lowa, from .which States most of our supply is drawn,
i he Call, considering everything of human interest to be a proper
I for editorial inquiry, has been at pains to make a study of
he methods by which is produced that great importation of alien
poultry and eggs. On the farms of lowa and Nebraska the busi
ness does itself, so to speak. The fowls need but little attention.
They freely range the farms, picking up a living and supplying
;hemselves with a varied diet conducive to their health and happi
neÂ«. Fowls and eggs are a cash product. The agents of the ship
pers either viÂ«it the farms and pay : cash for them, or they are bar
;crcd at the country stores, from which they are collected and pre
pared for shipment to California. What they bring is usually the
perquisite Â«>f the farmers* wives and daughters, and many a blushing

quite different from those that are fed on slaughter-house offal and
garbage.
Iri' rmg the reason why poultry is not made a side is^ue

getting California cash for their poultry and eggs. California ranch

mission. So they either buy their poultry arid eggs, or produce none
in excess of the supply for their own use. and the State imports to
fill the deficit, and lose<= the profit on a valuable by-product. What
<-eems t<>- be needed is not the founding- of more exclusive poultry
ranches, with their fight against pip and vermin, but a system of
collection and cash payment that will encourage every farmer to keen
as many chickens, as a by-product, as can scratch a good living on
his land.
\\ hen relieved of the uncertainties of sale by commission and
ed of a pood cash return, our farmers will consider it worth
while to consider chickens a proper part of their livestock. On every
farm where cows are kept, pigs and chickens should be aho, for
both make use of the milk and prevent its waste. As variety farm
ing enlarges here and with the introduction of a proper system of
'ing; poultry and eggs, making them cash at the farmer's door.
â¢ ill get a supply equal to the demand and not before, for
chicken ranching as an exclusive business will never cs'ch up with
the consumption.
Let us be good to our friend, the hen. and give her a chance
and she will supply us completely and save money to the State.
We are also looking into the matter of imported dairy products,

State could not stand if it were not the richest part of the earth,
and we will have something to say about man's other humble friend,
the milky mother of the herd.
THE REMAINS OF FORESTS.
THF. Cleveland Plain Dealer says that this Government is making
s sadly belated effort to preserve the remains of American for
ests. This is true of the forests in the East. Middle West
and South. The hardwood forests of many States have been wasted
and have left but few remains to be preserved, and this renewal is
for the benefit of remote generations because of their slow growth.
It iÂ« alÂ«o largely true of the fine coniferous forests in all parts of the
-y where the conditions of the soil and climate make their
vth an affair of many lifetimes.
In nnr mountain and Pacific Coast regions, however, the matter
of forestry takes on a different aspect. -Here are forests yet virgin,
to be preserved and cared for, while at the same time supplying tim
ber for all needful economic uses. When there are remains of for
ests to be preserved in all this region, the process is more promising
i results on account of the possibility of rapid renewal, provided
(rrt is kept out. It is a fact that the coniferous forests of this coast
an be so managed as to extend their area over all of its former field
and beyond, and to supply all of the future demand of the whole
<>untry for timber and lumber. This view should inspire the owners
nf timber land to seek the assistance and instruction of scientific
'oresters in harvesting their limber and taking care of the coming
rrop.
The possibilities include such a rise in the value of timber as
make foreÂ«t land the most valuable soil that men can own. A
n can leave to his heirs no more certain and valuable possessions
than a permanent forest. There is nothing uncertain about the fo
nt of such property. The experience of Europe in careful forestry
-r loses a progressive increase in the number of trees, in the size
4 hose harvested and in the volume and value of the output. Euro
can forests that were weak a century ago are now more extensive,
m better timber and more of it, and have increased in value be
md even usurious interest nn money. 'Government preservation of
\merican forests is not too late for the Pacific Coast to become the
permanent source of the timber supply for the whole country.

NOW OR NEVER
MARTHA M. WILLIAMS
BILLY WHARTON'S coming did
not surprise Joe in the least. She
had known something out of the
common was going to happen
ever since Saturday, when she
had seen the new moon clear, had a
black cat follow her home, and then
dreamed of getting safe across a clear
running stream. All these were omens
of good luck. It was the best sort of
luck to have a boarder in the big front
room upstairs, a gentleman, evident
ly, craving quiet, solitude, and country
fare. Mrs. Greer, Joe's stepmother,
had been set against boarders; she
would have none of them even yet but
for that dreadful doctors bill. She had
been at death's door last winter, her
first real illness. Though the doctor
was in no hurry for his fees, her in
dependence chafed mightily against
having him wait.
Therefore, Joe had had no new sum
mer frocks. Therefore, also, she was
not going to picnics and parties and
things â anywhere, indeed, but to
church, where the wearing of old
clothes might be regarded as a sign
of piety rather than poverty. The
board money would change all that.
In fancy Joe saw herself brave in new
winter finery, holding up her head
with the best. Her head had not really
dropped, for she was by nature
spirited and fu.ll of fun. But the step
mother was a little morbid on the
point of Joe's lacks, in. fear it might,
be said she neglected the girl, whom,
it was well known, she Â» id not love.;
Still they had go.t oh fajriy together
until the epoch of .Ransom Farley./ /
He was Mrs. Greer's nephew- and
prospective heir, hence it seemed to
him but right and natural that he
should marry Joe, who held a mort
gage on the farm. Mrs. Greer had
fetched her husband and hLs daughter
home with her to live, and the Greer
estate had been turned into cash and
used to free the homestead from sun
dry ineumbranoes. Thus common in
terest had kept the two women to
gether after Squire Greer died. Ran
som thought it beautifully fit that they
should go on living together and let
ting him take care of them. At least
that was his way of saying it. Joe
snapped that the care-taking would be
all the other way. She had hated
Ransom as a pink-and-white curly
haired model child. She did not hate
him less now that, although his curls
were cropped and his complexion was
somewhat tanned, he still held him
self to the model standard.
Joe was slim and dusky â lithe as
a sapling, with floss-like hair and
eyes outflashing black diamonds. Wild
roses blushed in her olive cheeks, her
lips were cherry red, her voice full of
flute notes. Billy Wharton had a
weakness for pretty girls; he made love
to all Fate threw in his way. Natur
ally he made love to Joe. Naturally,
also, he made her love him. He was
the man of her dreams, in every way
the opposite of Ransom, and very un
like any of the farmer lads or callow
city youngsters with whom she had
been brought in contact. But because
she loved Billy with heart and soul
and strength, she flouted him, laugh
ed at him, made a pretense of quar
reling and so kept him puzzled as to
her frame of mind. Puzzling over a
very pretty girl is bad for the affec
tions if the puzzler wishes to escape
free. But Billy did not know that in
time. He tried all a man might to
read this maiden riddle. He had been
quite fair, he thought â had told her
in the outset he couldn't afford to
marry until he wns gray and bald.
"I've nothing In the world now but
myself." he had said. "And though
ppace rates give a decentish living for
one. it's little short of criminal un
dertaking to make them furnish ra
tions for two." Then straightway he
had made Joe guide him to the deep
ei>t pool of the trout brook and stay
with him at the stream side all
through n summer morning. In course
of the talk there she had somehow
gathered that a long time ahead,
when certain lives ?nd leases lapsed.
Billy would have a snug maintenance.

head. Certainly, when in the sixth
week of Billy's stay at the farmhouse
Ransom was pleased to grow furious
ly jealous of him Joe decided some
thing must be done â and did it.
"Did you know there was a wed
ding coming off Sunday?" she asked \
Billy Thursday at noon. Billy pulled
out pencil and note book, putting on
his most professional air as he asked: ,
"Will you give me the names of the
victims, please, Miss Greer? â also any
Other particulars of interest?"
"Xo! Go ask the preacher," Joe ;
said, smiling mysteriously. -
Billy went, but came back more ;
than ever mystified. "The wedding ia â¢

we do â only that he has been asked ,
to hold himself in readiness at the
close of the morning service. Fur
thermore, he says you asked him.
Confess, young lady. You are getting
up a fine hoax."
"See if I am." Joe retorted, her head
higher than common. Â«3he ran off al
most instantly and was almost unap
proachable throughout the next two
days. But Saturday evening she
walked with Billy all up and down the
yard, the moon shedding silver flecks
upon them, the roses in the garden
filling all the air with perfume As
they walked Billy held her hand, and
insensibly it seemed she drooped to
ward him. Neither said very â¢much.

full on the mouth, saying thickly. "It

He slept little that night, but fell
into a heavy doze at daylight. It
lasted until it was almost time for
church. The sight of her set his heart
beating madly. She was all in white,
bride-like indeed, with a knot c-f pale
roses nodding on her breast. By their
rising and falling he knew she was
strangely stirred, yet when she mo
tioned him to follow and sit beside her
he obeyed, although Ransom Farley,
whom he cordially disliked, was at her
other elbow. All through the service
ehe sat statue-still, notwithstanding
he felt the tension of her mood in

Food Adulterents
and Digestion
Many methods of ascertaining the ef
fects of adulterants upon the health
and digestion of substances added to
food have been practiced. Artificial di
gestion can be made in the laboratory
from the digestive ferments secured
from the stomachs and pancreatic
glands of animals. The rapidity and
extent of digestion of this kind may be
modified by the addition of preserva
tives and coloring matters. This form
of experiment has been carried on very
exhaustively with almost all the sub
stances which have been proposed as
additions to foods.
A second kind of experimental Â«vi
dence Is obtained by feeding experi
ments upon the lower animals. The
guinea pig, the rabbit and the dog
have been the animals chiefly used for
these purposes. The results of such Â«
periments are more valuable than those
of the first kind because they deal with
the actual processes of digestion, and
not with their imitations.
If the digestive conditions of the
human, animal were the same as those
of the animalÃ abovu noted it would be
necessary to carry the experimental re
search any further. It is well known,
however, that every species of animal
has its own peculiarities respecting the
digestive processes. Hence, while gen
eral principles may be deduced from
the experimental data obtained on thef
lower animals, they .cannot be particti
larly applied to man. The .final ans-wer
in such cases, therefore, must De ob

There are many advantages and many
disadvantages attending the experi
mental conduct of investigations of
this kind upon man. In the flnst place
he must volunteer for the ordeal, and
this requires a great deal of self-denial
and self-control. In the second place,
the mental attitude which the subject
has toward the experiments is of con
siderable importance and must always
be taken into consideration. In the
third piece, the final determinations of
the effects which are produced in the
feeding ot lower animals are deter
mined by an examination of the organs
themselves, and this crucial test cannot
be applied to man.â H. W. Wiley, in

HOW MEN CHOOSE WIVES-ACCORDING TO A
LONDON PROFESSOR.
NEW theories of unconscious se
lection on the part of man and
wifeâ like mating with like â
as onpoeed to Darwin's ide*
that men and women depend
upon their perceptive and intellectual
faculties in choosing each other, were
propounded by Professor Karl Pearson
of University College, London, at the
Royal Institution, says the London
Mail.
He maintained that man has an un
conscious tendency to select a wife of
his own height, with eyes of his own
color, a proportionate span from fore
finger to forefinger, a forearm corre-
Kponding to his own, and a constitution
cf like physical vigor.
These theories he expounded by
means of tables and diagrams.
Among every 1000 men the color of
the oyes is divided as follows:
Blue 383
Green 312
H.izf-1 127
Brown 94
Tlif eyes of women are generally
darker, only 2fct> of them in every 1000
having blr.e eyes. If these blue-eyed
people married at random the result
v.ould be that they would mate at the
rate of 104 per 1000; but he had dis
t overetl that the actual number of
marriages per 1000 of blue-eyed per
sons was 1 10. or 3fi above the random
average, thus proving that the blue
oyed man and blue-eyed woman are
unconsciously attracted toward one
another.

The jury, composed of three clever
artist chaps, are having some rather
hard things said about them, and it all
happened thusly: These jury people

Piazzoni's. "'The End of Day," that
hangs on the west wall? "The Song of
the Marshland," by the same chap, is a

Four Facts For
Sick Women
To Considet
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
Has an Unequalled Record of Cures â
Mrs. Vinkfytm's Advice Is Confiden-
tial, Free, mud ahoays Helpful
Febst. â That almost every operation
In Our hospitals performed upon women
becomes necessary through neglect of
6nch symptoms as backache, irregular
and painful menstruation, leucorrhaea,
displacements of the uterus, pain in
the side, burning- sensation in the stom-
ach, bearing-down pains, nervousness,
dizziness and sleeplessness.
Second.â The medicine that holds
the record^ for the largest number of
absolute cures of female ills is Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
It regulates, strengthens and cures
diseases of the female organism as
nothing else caa/^iu''
For thirty years it has been helping
women to be strong, curing backache,
nervousness, kidney troubles, all uter-
ine and ovarian inflammation, weak-
ness and displacements, regulating
menstruation perfectly and overcom-
ing its pains. It has also proved itself
invaluable in preparing for childbirth
and the change of life.
Third. â The great volume of unso-
licited and grateful testimonials on file
at the Pinkham Laboratory at Lynn,
Masn., many of which are from time to
time published by permission, give ab-
solute evidence of the value of Lydia
X Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and
Mrs. Pinkham's advice.
Fourth.â Every ailing woman in the
United States is asked to accept the
following invitation. It is free, will
bring you health and may save your
life.
Mrs. Pl nkharn's Standing Invitation
to Women.â Women suffering from any
form of female weakness are invited to
promptly communicate with Mrs. Pink*
ham. at'Lyar*, Mass. All letters are
received, opened, read and answered
by women only. From symptoms given,
your trouble may be located and the
quickest and surest way of recovery
advised. Out of the vast volume of ex-
perience in treating female ills Mrs.-
Pinkham probably has the very knowl- *
edge tikÂ«t will help your case. Surely,
any woman, rich or poor. is very foolish
if she does not take advantage of this
generous offer of assistance.

LAWYERS ASK

Special Dispatch to The 'all

erable of a si-nsation has been caused

Goodwin and R. D. Duke of San Fran

dered the State for collecting amounts
due from escheated estates. It is
(â¢'.aimed that ii required only half a
day in Judge Hughes" department of
the Superior Court of Sacramento
County to adjudicate the States claims.
1Â» appears that the data upon which
the cases were "brought were secured
from the office of the State Controller.
Secretary A. J. Plllsbury of the State
Board of Examiners stated to-day he
was conducting an investigation as to
the amount of labor nerform^d before
action is tak-en on the clai: but he
intimated that he had not tl *jght the
service would entail such an outlay.
The attorneys were appointed by At
torney General Webb, who claimed
that his own office force was too busy
to handle it.

SEARCH SLOUGH
BED FOR GOLD
Special Dispatch to The Call
STOCKTON. March 30.â Several hun
dred Stockton people have the gold
fever. Two days agu some teamsters
engaged in hauling sand from the bed
<>l Mormon Channel at the foot of
Stanislaus street detected some glitter
ing particles in the deposits of the
currents, and on investigating found
them to be purest gold. They did not
retain their secret and on the same day
scirres of people â men, women and
children- iound their way to the lo
cality and industriously began panning
the sand and gravel. An occasional
find stimulated their interest and that
of others who had heard the story and
came as spectators. The excitement
grew and one or two hard workers
gathered as much as $30 each of the
yellow stuff. The fever spread to-day
and hundreds lined the stream's bank
and worked with varying success.
From time to time particles of the pre
cious stuff would be found and the ex
citement would grow. It was a veri
table Klondike rush and people could
be found working in the picturesque
crowd who would not be suspected as
probable victims of such excitemÂ«nt.
It is related that between $700 and
$1000 worth of coarse gold has already
been taken from the slough bed. The
majority of the oldtimers hold to the
theory that the gold was lost or buried
by the Mexicans in early days, for the
scene of the discovery is the site of the
Mexican quarter of Stockton in pioneer
times.

SAN DIEGO, March 30.â Judge Conk
lin of the Superior Court to-day Issued

PICK UNEARTHS
INDIAN RELICS
Special Diipateh to The Call
REDDING, March 30. â While bias
ing a trail over which he will guide
tourists to the summer fishing
grounds and health resorts on Pitt
River, Walter Hays, a resident of
Burney Valley, made an interesting
and valuable find a few days ago. He
was working in a little vale, between
two mountains, when his pick struck
something that gave >forth an unusual
sound. Investigation showed that the
pick had been driven through a mass
of curious Indian beads, shells, pieces
of wampum and other Indian treas
ures. Some of the beads and shells
had been In the ground so long that
they were turned to lime. Hays took
his relics home, cleaned and fumigat
ed them, strung the beads on a string
and brought them to Redding. He
has been offered a large price for
them, but will not sell. The place
where the relics were found is the
spot where almost the whole Pitt
River tribe was massacred by the Mo
doc Indians in 1873, and it is thought
that the beads belonged to these In
dians. The beads and shells are-auch
as are only found near the coast and
were probably priceless to the Indians.

seemed content with a good ex

San Francisco sustained the custom
ary and time-honored habit of getting
away with the first game, which was
gtl to satisfy even the most criti

yesterday th^y will figure in the one,

CRY OF "PLAY BALL" AWAKENS THE FANS
Umpire Klopf Rules
Players With a
heavy Hand.
OAKLAND, March 30.â The baseball
season opened in Oakland with all
kinds of trouble, of which the loss of
the first game to the Tfecomas by a
ecore of 8 to 0 was not the least. An
array of spectacular .effects had been
arranged by the management In the
chape of an automobile parade around
town, the pitching of the first ball by
Mayor-elect Frank K. Mott, speeches
by Clay Hawbaker of the Oakland
team and Mike Fisher of the Tacomas,
but there was trouble everywhere.
The first trouble came when Pete
Ltohman was suddenly removed from
the position he has held for several
years of manager and captain. George
Van Haltren, the veteran baseball
player, was given Lohman'a old posi
tion. He will be the whole thing, both
on and off the field. Lohraan will re
main with the club, but will attend
to the financial and ticket end. He may
catch a few games. -
Both clubs went up against Umpire
Klopf, and before the game was over
each voted that If Klopf was not a
Russian he was certainly a czar, and
from now on he is to be known as
C*ar Klopf.
Before the game opened a big white
automobile was run directly on the
pitcher's box and President Clay Haw
baker of the Oakland Association.
Manager Fisher of the Tacoma team
and Mayor-elect Frank K. Mott
stepped out. President Hawbaker an
nounced that Oakland was the greatest
city in the world and that Frank K.
Mott was the greatest Mayor Oakland
had ever had. Manager Fisher re
plied he was sorry the Oakland team
was Koing up against his champions
scared to death. Then Frank Mott
managed to throw the first ball half
way to the plate and the season was
opentd.
Both pitchers thought they were
getting the worst of it on balls and
strikes, but Klopf was boss and he
said so in no uncertain terms. He
ordered coachers on and off the lines
at will, and a sullen peace existed
until the sixth inning, when both
teams got men on bases and the play
lng wag close and fast. The kicks
began to pile up until the eighth
inning when Van Haltren, who was
on first, tried to make second on a
bad throw. The ball was returned to
second and Klopf called Van out. The
old National Leaguer made a start for
the umpire, started one swing for him.
and then junnped up and down in im
potent rage. Fortunately for Van
Haltren. Klopf did not see the act.
The facts remain that Oakland
could not hit Fitzpatrick and that
Klopf wa? a stern reality, and so
Oakland lost the first game to the old
champions by the following score:

MITCHELL ACCEPTS DEFI
OF BATTLING NELSON
Says Dane Cannot Stop White in Ten Rounds
Charlie Mitchell, the bluff and hearty
Englishman who is here with Jabez
Whit*, met Battling Nelson yesterday,
and there was fight talk in the air at
once. Some days since, when Nelson
â was in anything but an amiable frame
of mind, he said he could stop White
In ten rounds.
Mitchell picked him up on thia yes
terday and wanted to bet a lot of
money that he t-ould not do so. Nelson
stood to his guns, and expressed a de
sire to undertake the contract. He did
not have enough money on his per
son to bind the match, but went in hot
pursuit of Manager Nolan. He could
not find him, so he secured $1000 and
again Bought Mitchell. He could not
find him, so he posted the money and
expects it to be covered to-day.
Manager Nolan and Willie Brltt met
for the first time at an early hour yes
terday in an Kills-street cafe, and for
a time it seemed likely an "affair"
v. ould result. They had an earnest talk
for a few minutes and then went out
into the night. They started down El
lis street toward Stockton, and had
gone but a short distance when they
stopped abruptly and had another ani
mated discussion. They then went out
toward Powell street. Friends inter
vened and hostilities were declared off.
It developed afterward that Nolan
and Britt intended to take a cab and
drive out to the park, which they
could settle their grievances. On the
way to the hackman's stand Nolan re
membered that the cabby is an inti
mate friend of the Britts. He bet
heavily on the Californian every time
he started except in the memorable
affair with Gans.
It dawned on Nolan that he might
have to fight two men instead of one
and that resulted in a change in plans.
They were on their way to get another
cabby when their friends pointed out
the folly of their actions.
The Supervisors' Police Committee,
by a majority vote, yesterday recom
mended that the Yosemite Club be
granted the April professional boxing
permit fjfclcb the Hayes Valley Club
failed to secure from the board by a
tic vote last Monday. McClellan and
Boston voted in favor of the Yosemite
Club, while Eggers wanted the matter
to go back to the board without recom
mendation. Manager Jim Coffroth will

LOS ANGELES, March 30.â Portland
6, Los Angeles 6.
The baseball season opened in this
city to-day, with Portland opposing
the home team. The visitors won by
falling upon Baum's delivery in the
third Inning and lining out four
doubles before the side was retired.
After this particularly bad inning
Baum pitched splendid ball. French
pitched for Portland. While he was
batted freely, he managed to keep the
hits fairly well scattered. Both teams
fielded cleanly.
The weather was disagreeable. A
cold wind blowing from the northwest
and flurries of rain made It look doubt
ful for the opening game until nearly 2
o'clock. Notwithstanding this handi
cap there was a crowd of more than
two thousand on hand to cheer the
Mayor of Los Angeles as he tossed the
flrst ball over the plate.
The game was preceded by an auto
mobile parade through the downtown
streets. Score:

lilOK STTDEXTS RECEIVE
A TROPHY FOR VICTORY
Silver Cup Goes to the Team Wln-
ning Bay Counties Athletic
Field Day.
The presentation of the trophy of
fered to the team winning the bay
counties field day was the occasion of
an enthusiastic review of the tri
umphs of the Lick athletes yesterday
at Lick High School. The rally, as
the gathering was termed, was called
for 12:30. The men who spoke were-
Yell Leader J. Hill. '05: Baseball
Captain George "White; Barieau,
Lick's trusty fielder; Marlus Hotch
kiss, F. Bowley and D. H. Walker of
the student body.
The enthusiasm, which up to this
time had vented itself In rooting,
reached a climax for which the term
rooting was mild when Fred Moullen,
the famous track star, appeared with
the prize. In a few well chosen re
marks regarding the excellent work
and good training observed by the
members of his team in the last meet,
he bestowed the cup upon the mem
bers of the Lick faculty, represented
by Mr. Merrill.
In thanking the members of the
team Mr. Merrill expressed the idea
that from the present outlook it would
be the fortune of Lick to remain in
possession of the artistic cup, as the
interest shown by the lower classes is
great. Following the presentation
and acceptance of the trophy Mr.
Drew, Mr. Hewitt and Mr. Tibbetts,
members of the faculty, congratulated
the athletes.
have to secure two more votes to get
the permit from the board in addition
to the eight Supervisors who stood by
him on Monday*
A titanic struggle for the permit is
going on among the politicians behind
the scenes. Strong influences are for
and against the Yosemite Club, and the
outcome Is difficult to forecast.
Jabez White went to Larkspur on
Wednesday, accompanied by Charles
Mitchell Jr. He went at once to
"Smiling" Metzner's tavern, where he
will condition himself for his coming
battle. White was greeted at the sta
tion by a number of Larkspur sporting
men, who extended him a hearty wel
come. Jabez, by his affable manner,
has made quite an impression on the
residents, and in a short period prom
ises to be the idol of the town.
He is pleased with his training quar
ters and says he never conditioned him-
Belf in such a beautiful spot. He donned
his road attire yesterday and walked
to the outskirts of San Rafael. Real
hard work will not be indulged in until
the beginning of next week.
Mulachy Hogan, a recognized
American authority on boxing, says of
Brltt's pretensions to the title of light
weight champion:
Important m the coming Brltt-Whlte bout
will bÂ« It will yet lack one point of Inter
est. One of the fighter*, Britt, is not a tltla
holder. Junes Edward hae made many a
claim to being lightweight champion ot
America, but that line "lost to Joe Gans on
a foul" in his record keeps his claim from
being good.
The bout, then, will settle no world's cham
pionship. White has the qualifications to fight
for such a title, but Britt lacks his part
At that the winner Is likely to be hailed as
a title holder by many fight followers. It
is certain that the manager of each will
claim world honors for his man.
White Impressed those of us here who saw
him as Â«. grand looking pugilist. His weight
seemed evenly distributed, his shoulders look
ing especially good. He has the "flghtlnK
eye," too. and altogether looks like a well
assembled flghtlne machine.

SPORTSMAN'S SHOW
OF GREAT PROMISE
Big Pavilion Will Resemble
Real Forest To-Night.
The electrloai display was given
â way at Mechanics' Pavilion last night
for the first time on the forestry, fish
and game show which is to open this
evening and which will continue for
two weeks. The effect was startling.
R. Leo Van der Naillen has placed his
lamps so judiciously that a flood of
light went to every corner of the big
building, yet there was no glare. The
night display proved much prettier
than that of the day and the scene was
surpassingly beautiful. The trees
seemed greener and the mountain effect
at the rear of the hall was effective.
Practically all the live exhibits were
Installed during the day and there were
several exciting episodes while they
were being transferred from wagons to
their permanent quarters during the
coming show.
During the morning the concert band
had a rehearsal and the effect was
remarkable on the birds and animals.
A particularly wild pair of bob cats
have defied every proffer of friendship
from the keeper in charge, but they
became docile when the sweet strains
reached their ears. In a big cage by
himself is a bald eagle with an ugly
disposition, but he also became amiable
as long as the music lasted.
Tc/-night will mark the opening of
the show, but it will be a private view
for members and their friends. No
tickets will be sold. To-morrow morn-
Ing and every day until April 15, ex
cepting Sundays, the public will be ad
mitted. This evening's view will be a
dress affair. President William Greer
Harrison will preside at the dedicatory
exercises. Vice President James D.
Phelan will make the opening remarks
and will be followed by Dr. F. W.
d'Evelyn. The musical programme for
to-night has been carefully selected as
follows:

the two-year-olds at present regarded
as having a chance to develop into the
best to be seen In the West. Argu
ment between the owners of Yankee
Consul and George Leiper was re
newed to-day at the track.
Abe Frank, owner of Klingsor, the
second horse at the finish yesterday,
wants to make the match a three
cornered affair at four and one-half

match If the owners agree.

IREDEUS SECOND
TO ST. GEORGE JR.
Dr. Rowell's Big Bay Sprinter Falters as Wire
Is Approached and Loses Sixth Event
on the Card by a Head.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
It was refreshing- to see St. Oeorge
Jr. win the last race at Oakland yes
terday after receding from 11 to 6 to
4 to 1 in the betting, for most of this
sort usually get the crumbs left by the
guests. Garnet Ferguson disposed of
the black horse in the morning to T. E.
McLaughlin, and he ran in the colors of
the latter turfman. Dr. Rowell's Iredeus
closed an even money choice, and It
seemed overconfldence on the part of
Travers cost the favorite the purse. A
furlong from the wire, while Sad Sam
still maintained the lead. Iredeus
looked to hold St. George safe and waa
gradually closing on Sam. The last few
yards the favorite got to sprawling
about, and Wright dropped St. George
down first by a head. David Boland
lost the show to Sad Sam by a neck.
FOUR CHOICES DETHRONED.
Four public choices were dethroned,
and the ring must have had an inning.
Fine weather attracted a large attend
ance.
Unless things brighten up the friends
of Gloomy Gus will forsake him alto
gether. The Magrane entry ruled a
pronounced favorite for the opening
five and a half furlong run, and after a
somewhat squally passage finished
third. Velna, a 7 to 1 shot, showed
marvelous lmrjrovement over her pre
vious race. Getting away poorly, she
ran around her field, winning ridden
out from Angelica.
Larsen landed Busy Bee first for
the 2-year-old scramble In a driving
finish with Ebel Thatcher. The Pat
terson filly closed an 11 to 10 favorite,
and after getting away poorly, stood a
hard drive. Just getting up on the o\it
side in time to earn the decision.
Mazapan led Into the stretch and then
lost the show to Iron Watson.
POSSART PROVES THE BEST.
Possart, the even money choice, dem
onstrated he was much the best of the
eleven starters in the mile and a six
teenth selling affair. Travers got away
poorly with the black horse and, after
threading his way through the bunch,
beat Maxetta half a length in a driv
ing finish. Marelio, a 16 to 1 shot, took
the show.
There ara no apologies to offer for
the downfall of Evea G. even money
favorite for the mile and fifty yards
run. She was outfooted from the start
by War Times and at the finish was
beaten handily. Ray, a newcomer
from Ascot Park and 50 to 1. ran
into the show. The ring laid 5 to 1
about the winner.
Sterling Towers most assuredly did
not run the way an 11 to 5 favorite is
supposed to do, for she finished last In
the six and a half furlong sprint. She
must either have punctured a tire or
else cannot perform over a slow track.

FARMERS PLAY
FOOLISH JOKE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DAVENPORT, March 30. â A practi
cal Joke perpetrated by two Hawk
Creek farmers Tuesday evening start
ed two Sheriff's posses racing across
the country, sent the Coroner and
Prosecuting Attorney to the scene of a
supposed tragedy and stirred up the
population. The fake murder took place
in broad daylight before three excited
witnesses. The two farmers who should
be starring behind the footlights are
Charles Logsdon and his hired man,
Jim McKlnnon. The men were plow-
Ing in Logsdon*B field when they ob
served a neighbor, Henry Dick, his wife
and hired man in an adjoining field.
Suddenly the trio heard violent lan
guage and looking up saw Logsdon and
McKinnon apparently quarreling vio
lently. The great tragedian's under
study drew a revolver and fired. The
desperate man seemed badly wounded,
but staggered and grappled with the
object of his wrath. The two fell and
locked in embrace rolled on the ground.
Logsdon overcame his adversary, se
cured the Weapon and holding it to the
head of his prostrate victim, fired
twice. The three spectators hastened
away from the scene and Dick's hired
man rode flve miles to a telephone sta
tion to notify the Sheriff. Meanwhile
Constable Layson had gathered a pposes c
at Peach and was headed for the scene.
Coroner Kaulbach had been summoned
from Edwall, forty miles away. The
windows of the Logsdon house were
dark and the besiegers fancied the
murderer barricaded within. The house
was found to be deserted and a neigh
bor told the story to a sheepish-looking
lot of man-huntere.

STRIKING PLAYS
ON THE BOARDS
"The Monkey's Paw." by W.
W. Jacobs. Makes Hi<>- Hit
in London and in Paris
CREEPY SOBT OF THING
Alfred Bruneau Scores a
Success With Opera Jfftde
From One of Zola's Tales
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
LONDON, March 30.â A number of
rather striking theatrical productions
have recently been produced not only
in Lonaon, but in Paris and Berlin.
Of the lot Americans probably will be
most interested in "The Monkey's
Paw," by W. W. Jacobs â put on at the
London Haymarket. This little play,
which the author of "Many Cargoes"
is said to have written in order to
show himself capable of something be
sides humor, was first tried at a pro
fessional matinee in London several
months ago. Then it was translated
into French, and as "Le Main dv
Singe" was produced in Paris, where
it made a real sensation. It is now
being played in front of Jacobs' com
edy, "Beauty and the Barge," and is
pleasing playgoers so much that it is
sure to be done in the United States.
It is a "creepy" sort of thing. An
old sergeant major named Morris has
brought from India a dried monkey's
paw, on which some fakir has cast a
spell. The shriveled little piece of
skin and bone has the power of grant
ing three wishes to its possessor but â
and here lies the gruesome part of the
story â the wisher always regrets that
it has done so. An eld couple named
White and their son, a young electri
cian, to whom the major tells the story,
insist on trying the monkey's paw, and
against its owner's advice the elder
Whitft wishes for Â£200. This sum does
not drop from the clouds and the son,
Herbert, goes to his work at the elec
tric light works, teasing the old peo
ple about their unfulfilled hopes. The
next scene takes place on the following
day. The father and mother are wait
ing their son's return. Instead, a mes
senger from the works arrives to say
that he has been killed in the machin
ery and, in the name of the company,
to offer them Â£200 as compensation.
MAKES SECOND WISH.
In the days of grief that follow the
old couple forget all about the
monkey's paw. One evening a week
later, however, the mother suddenly
remembers that two wishes remain to
them and insists on the father wish
ing that the son were with them again.
He does so. At once there is a knock
at the door. Instantly the old people
are aghast at what they have done,
but the mother, her hands trembling
with emotion, tries to open the door.
The bolt sticks. She struggles to undo
it, while her husband clutching the
fateful paw, pronounces the third and
last wish â that their son may rest at
peace in his grave. As his words are
uttered the frantic mother tears the
door open and reveals â an empty
threshold,
The grim little tragedy just described
was written by Jacobs, with Louis N.
Parker. Mrs. Humphry Ward,also had
the assistance of this facile collaborator
in writing her play "Agatha," which
was given at a special matinee at
Tree's Theater recently. Unfortunately
it cannot be prophesied that "Agatha"
will be done in the United States, where
Mrs. Ward has so many admirers, for
although more stageworthy than her
dramatization of "Eleanor," the au
thoress' new piece makes but a feeble
impression. Surprisingly enough, it
proves old-fashioned to a degree, the
plot revolving round a typically flinty
hearted stage father and his attempt to
force his daughter into a marriage of
convenience.
Not since the production of "The
Sunken Bell" has Gerhart Hauptmann
had anything like as big a success as
that attained by his new play, "Elga."
This piece was produced at the Leasing
Theater, Berlin, before a distinguished
audience a few nights ago, and at the
end Hauptmann had to appear before
the curtain more than a dozen times.
"Elga" is unlike any of Hauptmann's
previous works. The story, told briefly,
is this: A German knight is on his way
to the King of Poland's court. He stonpj
over night in a monastery, where he 1b
attended by one of the humblest of the
monks.
WEIRD GUEST CHAMBER.
From the window of the rather weird
guest chamber In the tower of the mon
astery he sees the ruins of a dismantled
castle belonging to the Polish Count
Starshenski, who founded and endowed
the monastery with all his wealth. Fa
tigued by his Journey, the knight falls
asleep in his chair and dreams. His
dream is given in the ensuing six
scenes of the play, which follow one
another without any intermission. He
i sees the Count Starshenski as be once
| lived in the world, rich and happy in
the possession of his beautiful wife,
! Elga, and their child. But the dream
shows how the wife deceived her hus
| band and how the nobleman murdered
first the lover and then the woman, and
finally renounced the world. In the last
scene of the play we again have the
guest chamber in the monastery, with
the German knight awakening. He calls
his servant and they resume their Jour
i ney after having been served by the
I humble brother, who Is, of course,
Count Starshenski. '
The German critics are almost unan
imously of the opinion that this new
play of Hauptmann's Is a permanent
addition to the German stage.
All Paris is talking of the striking
opera which Alfred Bruneau has made
out of Emlle Zola's "Infant King." This
young French composer really has per
formed 'a. remarkable feat, for his work
just misses being great despite the fact
that the author worked with the most
unpromising material, so far as musical
ends are concerned; for Zola's "book"
I is not only written in prose, but is ab
solutely characteristic of its authorâ a
! sordid little tale of a Parisian bakery.
Yet Bruneau's score is full of vitality
and of fresh, fine colors. The orchestra
tion, too, is generally described as a
wonder of real richness.
STEAMERS ON SUNNYDALE
SLOUGH STILJL. ICEBOUND
Men Are Now Engaged in Trying to
Get Them Out (or Opening of
Klondike.
TACOMA, March 30. â The Northern
Commercial Company has begun the
work of getting its steamers in Sunny
dale Slough, opposite Klondike City, in
condition for. use during the coming
season. Men have been put to work
cutting ice from around the steamers
and preparing them for service.
The steamer Susie is high and dry,
out of the water, and will have to be
blocked up so that she will slide into
the water. The hull of the old steamer
Clifford Lifton, which was in Sunny
dale Slough when the big crash came
last fall, was crushed and she can in
the future be used only as a barge.

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. March 30. â Presi
dent Roosevelt finds himself araln
confronted by a serious negro prob
lem in the Postoffice Department. Like
the Indianola incident, this also
comes from Mississippi.
A rather neat looking, intelligent
negro, M. J. Horrisby, about 23 years
old, appeared at the White House to
day with a request to see the Presi
dent. This was the story he told to
the President's secretary:
A young negro stood the examination for as
sistant clerk in the poetofflce ax Yaioo, Mis*.
Ue received his appointment and accepted ths
place, but soon after that the people of the.
town did not care to do business with him as a,
postal official. Ha was given a sound thrash
ing on several occasions and then told to get
out. which he did.
Following this a special examination was
held to fill the vacancy. Four young negroes,
a negress and two whits men took the exam
ination. Hornsby, one of the negroes, stood
highest on the list and on March 21 he was
appointed to the poÂ«><Uon. He said that he
would have to go to his home at Jackson.
Miss., to get his bond, and the postmaster
gave him this permission. Before returning
to Tazoo news of his appointment got abroad
and the train which brought him back got
sidetracked on the outskirts of the town. There
was a gathering of twenty to thirty white men
near by and Hornsby, suspecting that he was
about to be attacked, left the train and took
to the fields. He was soon overtaken, how
ever, and carried to an empty oil mill, where,
he says, threats were made against his life.
He talked eloquently In his own behalf and
finally the crowd agreed to compromise If he
would leave town. He sent in his resignation
and then left Tazoo, tout only to come to
Washington to lay his case before the Fed
eral authorities.
Secretary Loeb told Hornsby the
President would not be able to take
up his case until he returned from his
Southwestern trip. Hornsby left the
White House very much disappointed,
but said that before leaving town he
would appeal to the Civil Service
Commissioner".
Yazoo is t. t home town of Repre
sentative John Sharp Williams, leader
of the minority in the House.
ENGLISH INITSSTORS WANT
FAMOUS CASE REVIEWED
Ask for writ of Certlorarl In Action
Against Estate of Colorado Mil
lionaire.
WASHINGTON. March 30.â A pe
tition for a writ of certiorari has been
filed in the Supreme Court of the
United States in the case of Stratton's
Independence Mining Company of
England "vs. the trustees of the estate
of the late W. S. Stratton, the Colo
rado mining millionaire. The case
involves a suit for damages in the
sum of $6,000,000 in the purchase of
Stratton's Independence mine at Crip
ple Creek. In their petition the pur
chasers set forth that they paid $10.
000,000 for the property, and this.
they assert, was $6,000,000 more than
it was worth.
They charge that the ore was
"salted" and say that in other ways
Stratton made the mine to app-ar far
more valuable than it really was. The
case was decided by the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit fa
vorable to the Stratton estate, and
the purpose of the petition is to have
the case brought to the Supreme
Court for review.

market was not much more than a drifting
match and thÂ» movement was not conclusive
or convincing- at any time. The volume of

la me discussion about the Stock Exchange
to the threatened stock transfer tax as the
lactor mai^ny tuoct for this tudden collapse
In activity. The decision to make this tax
bill a party measure was accepted as effer

Into law. Whiie the amount of thÂ« proposed
tax is net regarded ac extremely burdc-nÂ»om*
in the actual transfer of stockholdings from

that it would form a serious restraint up.
manipulative operations and upon the eo-cailed
scalping operations on the floor of the Stock
Exchange upon which the professional traders
largely rely for their livelihood. The manipu

â¢;rf reiied on also to further the

of such new issuee In prospect there is a fear
Lftat ihf marketing of them may be hand

grciind lor suspicion that if oth< conditions

the 'lisouesion beine a result rather of the

r.Â».^ of <-a.l money, but preparations were also j
going on for the April 1 settlement and the
plaxuac of the Pennsylvania bond issue looms
beyond. Confidence is professed that the
! herder tone of the motÂ»*\ market will be
â¢ livrt-r.vf-d and that the loan operations, when
conc-ludrd. will permit the quick return of
iheir proceeds to the money market. It is
vpon this conviction that current operations
Ir siorkr are rather of 11 waiting character
than a reflection of any positive opinion on
the outlook. The celling pressure was light,
but there is no disposition to buy on a larg*
tcsi". A weak bank statement on Saturday
Is takÂ«>n for granted. Although some of the
Ulterior exchanges on New York have risen
to a premium this is believed to be due to
r*mittances to participate in the Japanese
loan subscriptions. Interior banks, however,
are drawing freely on their New To- - cor
rrErofidrnts for payment of Internal revenue
conations. Rpturns of February net earnings
of railroad's st they, come to hand are not
encouraging to â  demand for stocks, although
the poor earning conditions then are shown to
be corrected by later returns of gross earn
'ln^s. Ime market got no help from foreign
influences, the weakness of Russians being
aggravated at Pari* by the German attitude

alarmed the shorts in those stocks and had
some sympathetic effect on the general market.
The (Errcatpr tranquil lity that was expected In
the call money market also contributed to
the late firmness. The wide movements in
a few low-grade securities were due to in
dividual causes. The market closed irregul&r
After its substantial recovery.

United States bonds were all unchanged on

HEWITT STILL
ON THE GRILL
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday resumed its investigation
into the violations of the ordinance re
quiring all wires to be placed under
ground in certain districts. Chief
Hewitt of the Department of Electric
ity was again questioned regarding his
failure to compel companies maintain
ing overhead wires to place them un
derground. He submitted a list of
fourteen such companies.
Joseph H. Blakeiy, foreman of con
struction, testified that there are quite
a number of wires strung on poles of
the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company, Western Union Company
and other companies in underground
districts Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Hewitt said
that he was under the impression that
he had ordered the wires to be taken
down.
General Superintendent Jaynes of the
Western Union Company said that all
of its telegraph wires had been put
underground, but there might be some
so-called "clock wires" still remaining
overhead.
"Unless you can show that the Su
pervisors by a resolution suspended the
ordinance you have been seriously
derelict in your duty," said Chairman
Brandenstein to Hewitt.
"We have persistently ordered poles
and wires duwn # despite the supension
of the ordinance," said Hewitt.
"The clerks have gone through the
records and can find no such resolu
tion of suspension," said Brandenstein.
"Well," said Hewitt, "if you will di
rect me to cut down the poles I will
begin work to-night."
"You want a letter of instructions to
do your duty, it seems," said Branden
stein. "All you have to do is to see
that the law passed in 1900 is obeyed."
Superintendent Naphthaly of thÂ« San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company
said that the company was proceeding
to take down its poles in the under
ground district, but claimed it was an
injustice to compel his concern to re
move them when others are allowed to
stand. Naphthaly said it would cost
$200,000 to place the company's wires
underground in three districts. The
delay was caused by the fact that the
city still maintained its wires overhead,
Xaphthaly said.
Hewitt claimed that the funds were
insufficient to put the city's wires un
derground, but Expert Williams pro
duced a statement showing that nearly
$200,000 had been set aside for the pur
pose in the last four years. Hewitt
said he considered a burglar alarm
system as exempt from the prohibitory
provisions of the ordinance and had
granted a permit to string overhead
wires to the San Francisco Electric
Protective Company for that reason.
The committee thereupon asked the
City Attorney for an opinion on the
subject.
The investigation will be resumed
next Tuesday at 2 o'clock p. m., when
six more companies will be questioned
as to why their wires have not been
put underground.

FRAUD CHARGED
BY CREDITORS
Fraud and conspiracy are charged
against the bankrupt grocery firms
known as Olson Bros, and the Olson
Company, Fred L. Hilmer, George L.
Fish and the City and County Bank
in a suit filed yesterday by Harris
Bros. & Co., alleged creditors of the
defunct firm, in the sum of $8640 11.
Henry, J. M. and Nelson P. Olson,
stockholders in the corporations
named, are joined as the principal de
fendants.
After reciting the facts surround
ing the assignment of the firms at a
meeting of creditors called by the
Board of Trade, the plaintiffs go on
to say that in January last the defend
ants named met and conspired to de
fraud the creditors of the firm named.
In furtherance of their conspiracy the
City and County Bank, holding a claim
of $8000 against the bankrupts, took
over the leases of the premises occu
pied by the stores of the bankrupts
and made claim that it held the same
as security for the payment of the sum
due it. As a matter of fact, the plain
tiffs allege, the City and County Bank
never held the leases as security until
the same were turned over to it at the
time of the meeting referred to. The
leases are said to be worth $10,000.
Following this act it is alleged that
the bankrupt firms transferred to
George L. Fish all of their assets for
a consideration of $50,000, claiming
they had sold the same to Fish out
right and would divide the proceeds
among the creditors. The assets*
plaintiffs claim, are worth $90,000, and
the $50,000 paid over by Fish was
only in the nature of a loan, it being
understood that he was to continue the
business of the corporations for one
year and that at the end of that time
the Olson brothers were to have the
right to again take possession upon
the repayment of the sum loaned.
It is alleged further that Hilmer and
the City and County Bank were mem
bers of the creditors' committee, and
as such had special opportunity to
carry out the conspiracy, and that
Nelson P. Olson was paid $2000 and
J. M. Olson $1000 to secure their con
sent to the scheme.
In conclusion the plaintiffs ask that
the court decree that Hilmer holds the
assets of the firms in trust for the
benefit of the creditors and, this done,
that he be removed and some fit per
son appointed to succeed him; that
the court decree the alleged sale to
Fish to be null and void and that the
leases of the stores be placed among
the assets and declared not to be held
as security by the City and County
Bank.
WATER OFFICIALS DENY
RUMOR OF NEGOTIATIONS
Story That Cragin Has Made Advances
Looking to Large Deal Is Dis
credited.
President Howard and Frank J.
Symmes of the Spring Valley Water
Company and Manager Beal of the
Bay Cities Water Company denied
emphatically yesterday that Edward
F. Cragin has been negotiating for a
sale or combination of the water com
panies which they respectively repre
sent. A story that such negotiations
were in progress was published in a
local paper yesterday morning.
"I never heard of the story until I
saw it in print," declared President
Howard. "There is no truth in it."
Mr. Symmes said he had attended a
meeting of the directors of the
Spring Valley yesterday and none of
the directors had been approached
and none knew of any negotiations.
Mr. Symmes is the chairman of the
executive committee of the Spring
Valley.
"No advances have been made to
the Bay Cities Water Company," said
Manager Beal. "So far as I know
there is no basis for the story."

ON THE ALERT
FOR COLLINS
With John Zimmerman behind the
bars of the Mirtinez jail charged with
stealing $9000 from John E. Daly, who
had charge of the Central Bank money
sacks, the search for Zimmerman's
much wanted confederate, "Tom"
Collins, is being prosecuted with vigor.
Zimmerman was further identified at
Martinez and his bail is fixed at $10,000.
Although Detectives Taylor, Dinan and
Wren are still being held on the case
by Captain Burnett, there is slight
possibility or hope of catching Collins
on this side of the bay. *
Across the bay the Sheriffs of two
counties are relentlessly following any
and every clew that may lead to the
capture of the suspect. Already ar
rests in various parts of the State have
been reported, but -in every instance
the man caught has not been the man
wanted.
Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County
hastened to Byron Springs on receipt
of word that Collins had been caught,
but the man in custody was a work
man who had a slight resemblance to
Collins. The hot springs of the State
are being especially watched, for it Is
known that of late Collins has been
suffering agony from rheumatism and
might have to visit them for relief.
The police 6f Bakersfield captured a
Collins suspect, but later advices
stated that the' man had proved his
identity. The police and Sheriffs are
confident, howevar, that Collins' cap
ture is only a question of a few days.
Every means of escape is guarded.
The police here, while almost sure
that he is not in the city, are never
theless, watching the water front to
prevent his attempting to leave by way
of river or deep sea vessels.
The draft of Zimmerman's letter to
Collins indicates plainly that Collins
was within a day's Journey from this
city Tuesday, the time the letter was
written. Zimmerman indicated his
intention of leaving Wednesday by the,
river, which might show that Collins
is hiding in the valley.
Frederick Clinton Manchester of 631
Van Ness avenue yesterday visited
police headquarters in regard to the
watch and fob found on Zimmerman
at the time of his arrest. He told Cor
poral Cills in the property clerk's office
that the description tallied with that
of a fob he had lost in Golden Gate
Park two years ago.

NEEDS OF LIBRARY.â The Public Library
trustees yesterday petitioned the Supervisors

bery and assault to murder.

volver. Rothchild was held up near his
