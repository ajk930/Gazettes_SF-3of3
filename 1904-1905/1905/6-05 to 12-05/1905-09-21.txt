PRESIDENT McCALX
SOME INTERESTING POLITICAL HISTORY. 1
President McCall of
the New York Life
Insurance Company
was the star witness
at yesterday* s ses
sion of the insur
ance investigation.
He charges men who
are now denouncing
those who contribute
to campaigns with
having chased him for
money during the
campaign of IQO4
and specifically men
tions Alton B. Parker,
who was Democratic
candidate for the
Presidency. McCall
says Parker 's friends
repeatedly asked for
campaign funds.
Parker denies that he,
directly or indirectly,
sought contributions

NEW YORK. Sept. 20.â Political con
tributions of the Xew York "Life In
surance Company and the connection
of Andrew Hamilton of Albany with
the alleged political activity of the
company were points around which the
hearing before the legislative insur
ance committee investigation turned
to-day.
President John A. McCall of the Xew
York Life Insurance Company was the
chief witness, and for several hours he
\u25a0was subjected to a fire of questions by
Charles E. Hughes, counsel for the
committee, concerning the money paid
for political purposes.
The climax was reached when Mc-
Call declared that the soliciting of
funds for campaign purposes was not
confined to the Republican party In
the campaign of ISO 4. and announced:
"Mjr life was made rreary by the
Democratic candidates chasing me for
money In that campaign. Some of the
very men who to-day are beine Inter
viewed ta the paper* and denouncing
men who contribute to campaigns were
crosstnc my path every step I took
looking lor money. One â the candidate
himself, Parker â if he wonld show up
his hooks when he was chairman of the
Democratic State Committee, It would
aive yon a fit. Ue never rejected a
dollar la the world. lie would take
every dollar that mas paid him."'
Judge Parker was chairman of the
Democratic State executive committee
In 158 S.
McCall's statement was greeted with
wiid cWfeerlng, which continued until a
threat was made to clear the room of
listeners If the crowd did not restrain
Itself.
With great care the account of An
drew A. Hamilton \u25a0with the company
was analyzed by Hughes, who made It
clear that a search was being made for
political contributions.
McCall stoutly maintained that he
had. given Hamilton no money to be
used in: Influencing legislation at Al
bany, but the admission was obtained
from McCall -that Hamilton's expendi
tures at Albany -were paid from the
company's funds and that his accounts
were not submitted to audit.
O.VLV VISUBAL ACCOUXTIXG.
It was shown that $225,000 had been
paid to Hamilton with only a verbal ac
counting to President McCall and that
at present Ha.milt6n owed the company
about $60,000. but McCall said. he felt
sure that Hamilton, who is now in
Kuropc. will repay the cum upon the
company's demand.
Judge Alton 8.. Parker. Democratic
candidate for President In 1904, to
nitrlit gave the Associated Press a
statement concerning President Mc-
Call's testimony relative to the solicit
ing of funds from the. New York Life
Irsurance Company by Democrats In
JSO4. The statement follows:
"My attention has been -called to cer
tain testimony said to have been given
to-day hy John A. McCall while'a wit
ness before the Insurance investigating
committee i In reply to Mr. Hughes'
question whether be thought 'that In
1904 the interests or the policy-holders
were, so seriously endangered that the
company ought' to .contribute.*. .

from a four-barreled pistol in a room
izx which she hart locked herself. shout-
Ing as she did so that she wanted to
die and warning all against entering.
A Judge of the Superior. Court was the
tlrst person to run to the room, where
it was though t Mrs. Crowley was try-
Ing to kill herself, but he was unable
to enter. Though she did not succeed
xn injuring herself, iirs. Crowley
plunged the . neighborhood into a tur
moil and brought the police hurrying
to the scene. In almost a maniacal
state she was finally conveyed to the
Receiving Hospital, arrayed only in her
night " robes. "
.The trouble took place at the resi
dence of Mrs. Crowley. 1175 Alice street.
shortly after supper, time. lira. Crow
ley had gone r to her room and Just a3

session - of his court, he heard a shot
fired. \ Instantly there iwas ; commotion
In * the' house .and in the neighborhood.
Judge Oarden rushed Into the house and
found that Mrs. Crowley had barricaded
herself in her room and was apparently
trying to comirit suicide.
,"Word was sent to . the police station,
and the patrol wagon, with Policeman
Grossman in charge, responded. Mrs.
Crowley was found in her room, with the
door locked on the inside. She announced
that she would not only , kill herself, but
any one who tried to enter. All efforts
to pick the lock proved futile, and more
help was J sent for from the police sta
tion. , . -;'._\u25a0

he finally succeeded In opening the door,
though Mrs. Crowley had threatened to
shoot, no matter who entered.

eled state, with the smoking pistol in -
her hand. The four barrels of the obso
lete weapon had been discharged. She
was almost fainting, and it was found
necessary- to carry her out of the house
by force. She was taken to the Receiving

had not shot herself, as she had threat
ened. -After she had been quieted she
was released from the hospital by Judge
Ogden and was taken home by friends.

CANADIAN AUTHORITIES ARREST CAPTAIN
McLEAN AT UNCLE SAM'S REQUEST.
NOTORIOUS SEALER .IS IN JAIL
WASHINGTON, Sept. 20. â Captain
Alexander McLean was arrested Mon
day at Victoria, B. C, by the, Canadian
authorities at the request of the Amer
ican Consul, acting for the. Depart
ment of Justice, under an indictment
obtained more than a year ago at San
Francisco on a charge of conspiracy in
fitting out the schooner Carmencita in
violation of the sealing laws. A tele
griim received at the State Department
to-day announcing the arrest, says that
the Carmencita had been refitted under
the name of the Acapuleo, of alleged
Mexican registry, and with a crew
xua.de up of men said to be as "choice
tt bund of robbers and cutthroats as
have manned a pirate craft since the
days of Captain Kidd."
The search for. McLean has proceeded
since May, 1904. His movements have
been known a greater part of this time,
but his course in his pelagic sealing
cruises has been conducted so cleverly
and with so sharp an observance of
the Utter of the law that it is said he
has made these very technicalities
cover his alleged evasions of the law.
For instance, he always has been care
ful not to be found within the three
mile limit of the sealing reserves, and,
although an American, carrying in
large part an English crew, he has not
been registered under either American
or British laws. On that account the
reciprocal arrangement between' these
countries for the protection of the seal
ing industry has not applied. He also
operated under both Mexican and Nor
wegian registry and apparently has been
successful in retaining one or the other,
despite the fact that he forfeited Mex
ican papers at least once. ;-; V ""

One of the Pullman porters, who was

story:
"I was Just telling one of the ladies
about the wreck ahead, when I heard
the engineer whistle for the rear flag
man, and I remarked that the wreck had
been cleared away In a hurry. The flag
man had Just about time to get aboard
the train when I heard the torpedoes,
which he left on the track, followed im
mediately by several short blasts of the
whistle. I realized that something was
about to happen and called to the pas
sengers to hold on tight, but the shock
followed so close after they did not have
time to realize what I had said. Most
of the passengers were out of the car at
the time of the collision."

Wreck Begins
With Freights
SALT LAKE, Utah, Sept. 20. â The
disaster near Harney that piled up
two passenger and two freight trains,
with fatal results to some and serious
injuries to others, was started by a
head-on freight collision.
Behind the westbound of the two col-
Ming- freight trains came the second
-ection of passenger' train No. 3. The
rirst section of this train had gone on
ahead. Five minutes back of Xo. 3,
, second, sectjaa.. came the third section*
Hoth these trains were heavily laden
with tourists. Stopped by the freight
wreck. No. 3's second section sent back
a flagman. According to authentic in
formation, this flagman was called in
with his signal just before the oncomtng
passenger's locomotive dashed Into the
roar of the waiting train.
Harney is 26" miles west of Ogden.
on the Southern Pacific. The wreck
occurred at 6:30 o'clock. The first re
ports to reach Salt Lake came early
this morning.
According to Information from the
tcene of the disaster the flagman of No.
J's second section went back with his
stop signals. Then he was called in. He
Is. said to have placed two torpedoes on
the track, constituting a danger signal.
Just as he reached the rear of his train
the crash came. The secrecy of railroad
men makes it difficult to obtain authentic
information.
Tourists from the middle West, Califor
nia-bound,on their Journeys to the Port
land Exposition, filled both trams. The
locomotive of the last train telescoped
the two rear cars of the second section.
Other cars were thrown from the track.
Owing largely to a low embankment the
casualty list was strangely small. The
head-on collision of freight, trains, the
cause of the disaster, occurred on a sharp
curve. The wounded are being sent to
Reno and to San Francisco.
The following is a list of the killed and

almost entirely bandaged up, he. was
able to tell something of, the accident.
He said he was in the flrst:coach of the
westbound . passenger train. The .first
intimation he had of the wreck was a
terrible crash when the two Strains
came together. The car heTwas In was
crushed Into kindling wood and he was
buried beneath the debris of broken ;
glass and other wreckage. He re
mained there for some time beforehe
was dug out: The two men, he, said,

Facts Show That San Diego
: Inquiry Was Conducted in
Hasty and Unusual Manner
Special Dispatch to TnÂ« Call.
VAULJEJO, Sept.; 20.â "About an hour
and a half after we had set the fires
boiler. B: began to leak. ;We could see
a .wide .column of "steam forcing itself
through", a hole ~in the rear sheeting.
The water-iender gave me a quick or
der. to,run up above and; get ; a boiler
maker*, to. hurry .'down and repair the
damage. I obeyed Instantly, for. I could
see plainly that the leak threatened to
be a dangerous one. . Barely . " had I
reached 'the .' deck when the explosion
took place. I heard a terrific blast and
in a moment I saw the clouds of scald
ing steam crowd up through the hatch
way and out on 'the, deck. \u25a0-\u25a0; I knew then
that I was too late. My comrades were
beyond; any, help, from me." :
- This was the which : J. J.
Worthen, I sole survivor of the engine
room crew." on .the Bennington, . made
this morning. In. the proceedings of the
court-martial ! of Commander Lucien
Young. It was a description of the ex
plosion and the. few minutes -elapsing
Just , prior to the catastrophe, -but to
the minds of those in the courtroom it
was more than a mere tale of an es
caping^ white " monster >, and consequent
death. It brought, before their minds
a vivldtpicture of -a weak boiler, one
which had. outlived its .'usefulness sev
eral years ago, one which had been re
ported'as dangerous time and time
again by Commander Young and -Ad
miral Goodrich, and yet. which, with a
knowledge -of all this/ was;half-over
hauled by the Navy Department and
sent out on a ; 30.000-mile cruise.
The; testimony of Coal-Passer J. J.
Worthen - was ' the most > important evi
dence 'introduced during to-day's ses
sion of the court-martial. -He alone of
all the 'engine-room crew is the sur
vivor of that July ; day in San Diego
harbor^ and his escape came through
the carrying out of. an order given him
by his immediate superior.
| jfl The proceedings of the court-martial
of -Commander Young seem to clearly
show the haste with which the San
Diego; lnvestigation was conducted. Xo
cross-examination > was allowed and
witnesses - gave -as facts knowledge
which ' came ."to them' by hearsay or
which was '- merely their, own opinions.
This has-been brought out day by day
by Judge; Gear, attorney for Comman
der Young, and. his objections to testi
mony have ; served ; to; strike out from
the records many statements which
were included In the testimony obtained
by the investigating board, which met
directly after the catastrophe. For In
stance, one enlisted man swore that he
had heard the safety valve of "A"
boiler J>low off. He thought that he
had, but _ cross-examination - disclosed
the fact that he was In a part of the
ship out of sight of the boiler and that
he could" not possibly have told by the
sound whlch'of the valves was blowing
off. ' Â»
Another startling* fact was brought
out : when' Captain E. E. West, for the
prosecution,'. Sought .to introduce blue
prints showing; the construction of the
machinery around ; the boilers of the
Bennin'gton.- Their, admission ;as evi
dence was . hotly." contested by the de
fense. They were not countersigned by
the . maker, nor lndorsedtby the Secre
tary ; of the . Navy.". They merely . bore
.the stamp of the department of steam
engineering' at 'Washington. Captain
sTVest " admitted ' \u25a0\u25a0 that '- he :had not seen
them made nor did he know who had
made them, though he was under the
impression . that they were recent
prints. \u25a0 .The court was divided, and af
ter a lengthy discussion decided to ad
mit them. .
After; the. prints were admitted an
Investigation \u25a0 showed i that > most of
them were copies of drawings made
when the': Bennington was first placed
in commission. - Since that' time , the
boilers- of ..the"; Bennington have been
overhauled many times, and. according
to statements ' of " several orncers of the
ship, when the explosion took place the
valves and gearings ,were entirely dif
ferent from, those pictured in the blue
prints..." J. "
( IThe ' proceedlngrs of ' to-day, advanced
rapidly, and three witnesses were
questioned. Charles Buskirk, who was
stationed 'in: the launch at the time of
the explosion,, testified that he had
never: seen "Commander Young .in the
engine-room." 4 Lieutenant Commander

Total Loss Is Not So Great
as Was at First Estimated,

OAKLAXD. Sept. 20. â Plans are al
ready being made by nearly all the
larger firms burned out yesterday in
jtlie fire, which wiped out the block be
tween Second and Third and Washing
ton and Clay streets, to begin the work
of rebuilding their plants as soon as
the debris can be cleared away. 'An
Investigation to-day showed that the
loss is not as large as was at first es

buildings destroyed was practically
nominal on account of ' their flimsy,
construction. Following is
a detailed statement .of the losses of
the individual sufferers in the fire, with
the amount of Insurance in each .case,
which places the total loss at $64,525,

The block which fell a prey to the
flames has long been deemed one of the
most dangerous in the city, and. be
cause of this fact the premium has been
bo high that few of the owners car
ried any insurance. The premium .in
that section of the manufacturing dis
trict ruled at 12 per cent, and among
the Insurance companies it is known as
one of the "keep off" districts of Oak
land.

Students at the Univer

BERKELEY, Sept. .20.â MiUtary com
missions at the university have always
been In demand heretofore, but now the
authorities appear to be '- confronting a
situation where seniors and juniors, who
are exempt from drill, must be coaxed to
continue by the promise of extra credits
for the â¢ work, this inducement being ex
pected to result In keeping, enough men
in line to provide material for commis
sioned officers.
Recorder Sutton to-day issued the fol
lowing notice to juniors and seniors:
Juniors or seniors who have ' already com
pleted the required work In military science
and who desire to continue ' work in the de
partment durlnr the current year of 190V0C
will be allowed the following credit: For ser
geants (Juniors), I one ' unit for | each half year;
for. commissioned officers (Juniors . or seniors),
one and a half units each half year.
Under the new arrangement with the
War Department, in force this year for
the first timer military work is confined
to the freshmen and sophomore years,
juniors and seniors being exempt. The
commissioned officers are chosen from the
upper classes, however, and so many men
have quit military work_entlrely that the
supply of officers and material for officers
has greatly diminished.

Special Dlscatcn 'to The CalL
PALO : AL.TO, Sept. 20.â 1n a spirited ad
dress on "The Relation of the Church to
the Industrial Social Problem" Rev.- Dr.
1 George C. Adams of San Francisco stated
before the Congregationalist convention
j to-day 'that the work of the "church la to
help settle the. labor question, as "It has
done other questions of social and po
litical economy." Discussing the same
subject Rev. R. H. Chamberlain of Oak
land took a somewhat different stand,* but
agreed that the church should Induce tbÂ«
laboring classes to attend services. "
1 : "Unions are a good thing." asserted Dr.
Adams, - "and they will live more re
ligiously whea they feel that the differ
ences between themselves and em
ployers no -longer exist. The agitation
over capital and labor Is prolonged by the
desire for money by the employers. By
a concentrated : effort on the part of all
religious ' bodies * 1 hope to oee a recon
ciliation brought about.
"Suppose, we seek out the best or the
men, employers, as well as laborers, and
inspire, them wlth'ti spirit of greater hon
esty between ' themselves. In "this there
alone is a solution. To champion the
cause of one class wauld.net, be a con
servative policy, but to take up every
phase of the. problem, however dlfncnlt.
and work it out systematically. will suf
fice." "
"Has the working class withdrawn from
the church, or has the r church withdrawn
from tfie'- working class?" was asked by
Rev. Mr. Chamberlain In his address.
"The present hostility of the working
class toward the church makes our stand
for brotherhoods, fraternities and the op
pressed Imperative. The church's policy
toward . the rich is the cause of this hos
tility,' and when the laborers are admitted
to religious benefits the same as the capi
talists we can hope for an amicable set- '
tlement of union difllcultles."
A report ; submitted "by the Industrial
committee, consisting of Rev 3. Charles R.
Brown. 1* D. Rathbone and John H. Kim
ball, was distributed among the .congre
gation. .It was headed. â¢.The- Industrial
Problem Is the Problem of the Age.". It
, s,tated ' the supremacy of. "man over
money" and called : the labor unions an
economic necessity, deploring the com
bination of capital . and .the \u25a0 existence of
trusts to the non-interests of the laborer.
Rev. A." C. Harwood of Paradise, Butte
County, announced that a college was
under way at Paradise, being built by the
Congregatlonalista: and to be a school con
ducted on a Christian basis. He. said the
cornerstone; was to be laid ' Saturday and
that; the dedication ' Would take place on
the;.qompletion of â¢ the first $30,000 - build- ;
ing : on Christmas' aky.**l9os." The"" conven-"
tion . has - agreed to support the project,
although It is being constructed with the
money of Individual Congregatlonallsts.
Progress was announced by Rev. G. H.
Dekay of Lodi In speaking on temper
ance. Rev. A. B. Snider of Cloverdale
responded with plans' of further success.
The usual business of the - association
was transacted and the report of the Cal-'
ifornla Home â¢ Missionary Society was
heard.
The convention adjourned,' to* reconvene

"SUNDAY," STRONG ROMANCE
OF THE WESTERN COUNTRY.
TITLE ROLE FITS MISS BARRYMORE
POPULAR ACTRESS WHO RETURNS TO THE COLUMBIA THEATER NEXT
WEEK TO PRESENT HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME "SUNDAT," THE NEW
PLAT FROM THE PEN OF THOMAB RACEWARD.
There Is plenty of real human Interest
in "Sunday." the new four-act play by
Thomas Raceward, in which Charles
Frohman presents Miss Ethel Barrymore
at the Columbia- Theater for an engage
ment limited to twelve evening perform
ances an dtwo Saturday matinees, begin
ning Monday, September 25. In the va
rious roles in which Miss Barrymore has
appeared since she became a star there
is none perhaps which affords . her better
opportunities, and in several intensely
dramatic scenes Miss Barrymore displays
unusual power.
At the opening of the play Sunday, who
has been left on the death of her father
in the care of four rough but big-hearted
"Western miners, has reached womanhood
and is about to be sent East to complete
her education at an Eastern convent. A
young English scoundrel \ Insults her and
Is shot down by Jacky, the youngest of
her four guardians. In the \u25a0 second act
Sunday is an honored guest at Brlnthorpe
Abbey, in England. Colonel Brlnthorpe
asks her to become his wife, but. al
though she loves him, she declines, for it
was his brother who was killed by Jacky.
She returns to her Western home. Colonel
Brlnthorpe follows. There are explana
tions, and all ends happily with the fall
of the curtain.
Charles" Frohman has provided an ex
cellent production for, "Sunday," and the
notable supporting cast Includes Bruce
McÃhea, who was Miss Baxrymore's lead-
Ing man In "Cousin Kate" last season;
John Barrymore, her brother; Olive Oli
ver, .Virginia Buchanan, Joseph Brennan,
Charles Harbury, "William Sampson, Her
bert Percy, Harrison Armstrong . and
James- Kearney. _
The advance cale of seats begin* tÂ«-day.
â¢Trilby" at the Colombia.
The audience greeted "Trilby" yester
day at the Columbia as they welcome
"La Boheme" at the TlvolL As the
woman next me said: "You want to
shake hands with the. whole crowd â
even Bvengall."' Mr. Lackaye put It
that In no other play that he knew was
there such an entente oordiale between
audience and player aÂ« In "Trilby": that
the piece "Inspired affection"; that it
had outlived ten years of change and
progress In play-making, still to. meet
with this >ame "affection."
"The play- Is perhaps not possible."
said the actor; "it Is bizarre, yet It has
outlasted plays of much larger preten
sions, and those who came first to see
It are among the last to see It I have
no doubt at all that there were present
thla afternoon many gentlemen."
A few late guffaws and; a small,
feminine titter met It, Mr. _Lackaye
waitedâ and waited. He waited . until
the deceived femininity, trapped almost
Into tears â¢'. by ." his , aHectlonate } remi
niscences, was bullied into a' great, soft
laugh at Its own expense, and then said:
"Better late thp.n never." .
Mr. Lackaye's Svengall still remains
among: the great creations In "char
acter? portraiture. Possibly to-day the
character Impresses/as less "bizarre,"
Its hypnotic features. as less wildly
Improbable, than on the play's first pro
duction. But the figure only grains
strength thereby, a greater fullness of
that weird power with which Mr. Lack
aye so Intimately Invests It. * And he
never played better than yesterday^aft
ernoon, nor In the oily comedy of ; , the
opening' acts.; nor., where 'the ; . supple,
needy musician , becomes the wizard.
The death scene â still holds \u25a0 its ; big
thrill, and It ; was after- this that Mr.
Lackayc was compelled, to his speech.
The support is . more ; than -. prood.
The Trilby of Miss Oakes is comely
and convincing, the Zou-zou of ; George
Splnk is a "delicious bit of effervescent
fun; ".Taffy, Hale Hamilton takes _ good
care of,' and" so A. H. Stuart ot the only
Laird. Frank Dekum Is . the Little" Bil
lee, and Is "earnest, if wanting; in, the
sweetness of that charming young gen
tleman."" "The landlady 'was -capitally
done and the- whole cast, in; fact, ade
quate.
There are \ still three .nigrhts of ; Mr.
Lackaye's engagement, "- and iit . seems
to . me that r very; profitably" two of them
might go ' to :. rTrilby.'*

HILL SEVERELY
CONDEMNS GRAFT
President of Great Northern
System Addresses South
ern Minnesota' Farmers
DERIDES PANAMA CANAL
Declares That Only the Eail
roads Are the Eeal Bene
factors of the Country
PRESTON, Minn.; Sept. 20.â James J.
Hill, president -of the Great Northern
Railroad, addressed the farmers of
Southern Minnesota,* who . assembled at
the Flllmore County _; Fair , here to-day.
After severely condemning graft in pub
lic and private life, Mr. Hill said:
- Your main needs, are: .-An: adequate market
In \u25a0which v your., products - may *be \u25a0â¢â¢\u0084 sold <at a
fair price and' an : opportunity \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 to * purchase
those things .-you need .which : the .farm does
not supply. As far as your grain Is concerned
you must sell in the : markets -of : the world.
The tariff will . not help ': you ; although - youi
politicians I may 6ay you - are :. protected and
thereby \u25a0 helped, - you know â¢ better. -.\u25a0-. .: There Is
one ' way. i however, in ;\u25a0: which -\u25a0; you '.. may ib*
helped, and that is by lessening the cost of
transrwrtation.
It is .an easy - prophecy, because It is a
business fact, that railroad rates in this coun
try - would decline ,- more -. slowly : under - Gov
ernmental control than If . fixed â¢by those who
Intelligently manage railways, v No public body,
would . dare make reductions so sweeping - as
those that have been made voluntarily by rail
ways. \u25a0 '\u25a0 . \u25a0â¢- \u25a0 \u25a0'. - ' ' ! -. . ' \u25a0\u25a0-: ;'\u25a0\u25a0
The Government cannot discriminate between
ports or places. It must be Impartial. There
fore it would sooner or later be . obliged to
ordain a distance tariff. The low charge for
the long haul would disappear and you farm
ers here in Minnesota would be the most
heavily tariffed people in , the world.
Â£. Hill touched on the Orient as the
future market of the wheat-producing
States of the United States. He ob
served that â¢ the Panama canal, while
it f might" be a worthy project, was an
expensive toy,' but one that. this country
could afford. He derided the argument
that any great benefit would accrue to
the people from It.-
Again in referring to the Oriental
trade, Hill said:
SBy one policy we have angered and in
sulted a nation of 400,000.000 people, all pros
pective customers, so that, though . singularly
patient by nature, they have gone to | almost
national determination not to admit our . pro
ducts to their markets. By -another "policy
we have made It almost impossible to control
the carrying trade , to. the Orient, for lack of
which our foreign : commerce languishes ,In
every quarter of the Elobe. , ;
In closing, Hill'said: ;
This fallacy that the United States Is getting
control of the \u25a0 markets \u25a0of the world needs to
bs studied and honestly answered. .' Because
our highly protected manufacturers -are , ; able,
by reason of. the, high prices -.they, charge you
to send a certain ; portion of .-,. their . output
abroad and sell it for half .of what - you pay.
we are not conquering the commercial world.

If the Commuters continue to * play
the game as they did yesterday they
won't lead this baseball league much
longer. The Giants just fooled around
come and slipped five runs over with
out going fast at that. Oakland was
lucky to get one, though they secured
hits enough to make a fight if nothing
more.
None of the fans present would know
it was a game of ball unless they heard
the umpire calling balls and strikes.
Xelther team was there with any life
or any ginger, and no one seemed to
care whether the score was 1 to 0 or
100 to 0. Puddin* Hackett was the
only man to get a hand, and he worked
hard for his.
Hackett's work was the only thing
in the game worth going to the park
to see. The portly lowan pegged five
men out at second, and it would have
been live more, maybe, had the Giants
not quit stealing bases on him. But
for Hackett's true and unerring whip
the Giants surely would have rolled up
about five more runs.
Portland waded right in during^ the
first round and grabbed a run. Atz
received a pass and McCreedie sacri
ficed. Mitchell lined one down toward
6hort, which Richards tried to butt in
end take. The ball g-ot away from him
and Atz arrived during the mix-up.
Schlafley's single and out and Jlc-
Hales double to left field helped an
other over in the next period. One
more was added in the fifth on Mo-
Lean's double, JlcHale's sacrifice and a
long fly by Sweeney.'.,
It was good night when the eighth
rolled around.' Schmidt bumped Essick
in the slats and gave Atz a base on
balls. McCreedie advanced both' an
out and Van Buren hit to Richards.
Richards threw . the ball to Moskiman
end he dropped it. He returned it .to
Kelly, and the latter also let it get
tiway from him, so two more runs came
through and it was over for keeps.
Schmidt did not have a thing save
a tiresome motion and a glove. From
the present looks of things the smiling
kid is about in. He gets his every time
he tries to pitch now, and any old
kind of a batter seems able to wallop
the bcÂ«t he has. The score:

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept 20.â
The freshman team of the Stanford
University met decisive defeat to-day in
the first game of the season at thÂ»
hands of the eleven from the Berkeley
High School by the score of 6 to 0. All
the scoring: wat accomplished by thÂ«
"prep" school x>layers In the latter part
of the last half and was mainly due
to the constant fumbling of the fresh
men and - the splendid booting of thÂ»
ball by Sollnsky. the Berkeley quarter.
The same commenced at 4 oclock on
the old football field before the entire
student body of the university, which
had flocked to the scene to witness the
youngsters in their first contest. Berke
ley kicked to Stanford and the ball was
advanced for a small grain. After a few
futile attempts to advance the ball the
Cardinal kicked. The remainder of this
half was mainly a repetition of punts,
several telling' gain 3 being made by
Terrill. the right halfback of Stanford.
The half closed with the ball well
within the territory of the high school
I ii i i VJBHffl
A totally new lineup represented the
freshmen in the next half, but proved
ineffective to stop the -wild dashes of
the "prep" school huskies.
The first scoring was done on a touch
down made on a fumble by the fresh
man quarterback in attempting to catch
a punt -.vhich should have been allowed
to pass. This fluke netted two points
for the visitors and with this encour
agement they entered the game- with a
new vim and finally forced the ball again
well into the Cardinal territory and
from the ''\u25a0 27-yard line Tackle Solinsky
engineered a pretty place kick, between
the "sticks," practically closing the
fame, although In the remaining few
seconds the university youngsters
played like demons.
The Stanford snuad was in the gam*
bodily and the result is therefore in no
manner a" means of comparison with tha
score made. at Berkeley in. the contest
between the r'val freshmen and thÂ«
high school players.
The Berkeley lineup was as follows:
Peck, fullback.. Thorcas. right half;
Miller, quarterback; Watls, left guard;
Doane, Center; Steams, right guard;
Eowman and Nance, left tackle; Solin
sky and Merritt. right tackle ;.Barnett
and McKully. right end; Steele and
Newcomb, left end.

The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ehip Company's liner Doric, Captain
EalCh, sailed yesterday afternoon for
the Orient, loaded down almost to her
Plimsoll mark with freight and crowd
ed with passengers. In addition .to
Chinese and Japanese In the Asiatic
steerage, the Doric carried more cabin
passengers than any but the big liners
have taken to the Orient for some time.
About thirty of. her passengers were
:or Manila.
* The Doric's cargo included 800 tons
of flour, the biggest shipment of this
product that has left port for many
months. She also carried a large quan
tiJy of machinery for Japan. Some
single pieces weighed ten tons. The
shipment of machinery to Japan ha*
been heavy for some time and future
shipments promise to be even more ex
tensive. The Manchuria, which follows
the Doric, will carry to Japan ten loco
motive boilers, each weighing fifteen
tons.
Chic; Engineer Allen ojf the Doric
remains on shore for this voyage, his
I lace being taken by H. S. Boumphrey.
Allen is the oldest engineer and rated
as one of the ablest In the White Star
I-sne. His vacations have been few j
.fend far between, but when he watched
the Doric leave without him yesterday
bÂ« was not nearly bo cheerful as he
usually is on sailing: day.
Among the passengers on the Doric
was L. F. dc Castro, Consul for Portu

raerly surgeon on the Doric, went out
as a passenger to the Orient, where he I

Welch Creations Are Placed

.Judge Seawell as Exhibits
VALUE OF ONE IN ISSUE
A. W. Foster, Railroad Mag
nate, Tells How Price Was
Kaised on Him by Firm
The brightest spot in Judge Seawell'a
department of the Superior Court yes
terday/was over in a corner where lay
Thad "Welch's Marin landscape, painted
for A. W. Foster,. president of the"Cali
fornia Northwestern Kailroad Company.
Over 1 the price of this picture -flxed by
Schussler Bros. Va > legal | battle ia on.
A drowsy herd, -'bathed in the light of
the setting sun, seemed. to tell of peace,
but the^dark frowns on the faces of
the litigants' told of strife inharmonious
with the theme of i the painting.
.The picture was taken '\ to court that
Judge, â¢â¢. lawyers and spectators might
see the beauty of the work* of art that
has caused , a reflection to jj be cast on
the j business integrity of j the firm that
contracted, through Its alleged i-gent,
Frederick Junior,- with Welch for its
production. Near this picture stood
another/ from the brush ".''of .the' same
master, this an exhibit solely to show
the size; and manner of picture Foster
was seeking when he went to Schusaler
Bros, in search of new studies for his
gallery. The exhibit Itself attracted
much favorable comment and while the
quibble over the price of, the first went
on Welch's reputation as an artist
grew among, the spectators. In fact,
the courtroom held a miniature Welch
salon and an announced exhibition of
all his : works | would have attracted
scarce more attention. >;
â¢ FOSTER OBT THE STAND.
When the case was called for further
hearing President-Foster was called to
the stand for cross-examination, his
counsel, Sidney M. Van Wyck Jr., hav
ing concluded the direct examination at
the last hearing. An effort was made
by Attorney I. ; I. Brown, representing
Schussler Bros., to secure an admission
from Foster that Junior had told him
that the advance on the price from $350,
as originally agreed upon, to $760. was
on account of .the frame ordered by
Foster, which was much more elaborate
than the, firm had In .' contemplation
when It" agreed to furnish the- Welch
for the price first set. Foster said that
Junior had told him no such thing, but
that "after .the price had^been raised
Junlorf had told^ him: that the increase
was due to the fact that Welch had
painted "an exceptional masterpiece"
and that the painting he had created
was well worth the additional price
asked. ' > -
The point the defense sought to make
on the price of the frame was negatived
in the afternoon, when it was compelled
to admit that the price of the frame
was only $87 50. The .defense then
sought to show that the Whole transac
tion was one . between Foster^ Junior
and WeJch and that the defendants In
the suit, Schussler Bros., were not re
sponsible for the original price set, nor
for the t Increase subsequently made.
Henry* Schussler' was. put on. the stand
by. the plaintiff in an effort to upset this
contention of the defense. The ques
tion as :to ..whether Junior was acting

CORPORATIONS
MEET DEFEAT
Judge Sloss Holds They
Must Pay Annual License
Tax or Forfeit Charters
BIG VICTOEY FOE STATE
Treasury Will Be Enriched
by Hundreds of Thousands
of Dollars Each Year
Judge Sloss handed down an opinion
yesterday sustaining the validity of the
act passed at the last session of the Leg
islature providing for an annual license
tax of $10 upon every corporation or
ganized under, the laws of the State and
upon every foreign corporation doing
business in this State, with the exception
of those organized for the purposes of
charity, -education, religion and science.
The decision is aya v most Important one
and means the enrichment of the State
treasury to the extent of several hundred
thousand dollars a year. The decision was
reached in the action instituted by I. Ros
enthal & Co., as the' representative of va
rious corporations, to restrain Secretary
of State Charles F. Curry and Governor
Pardee from enforcing the provisions of
the law*. / -" -
It was the contention of the corpora
tions that the act In question Imposes a
tax on property, and that such property
by the act is not taxed In proportion to
its" value. This condition, the plaintiff
held, operated as. a violation. of both the
State and Federal constitutions. Judge
Sloss, however, holds that this contention
is not based on a true conception of the
act and that Its validity Is unassailable.
OI'IXION OF THE COURT.
In his opinion Judge Sloss says:
The language of the act Itself gives no In
dication of an Intent to Impose a tax on any
property of the corporation. The purpose of
the statute, as declared In the title. Is to
provide "for a license tax upon corporations."
Section 1 declares that no corporation shall
do business In this State "without a State
license therefor." Section 2 provides that
"upon every corporation â¢ â¢ â¢ there shall
be an ' annual license tax of $10." $ The very
fact that the tax Is fixed at an equal amount
In all cares, without reference to the amouut
or value cf any property owned by the varlou*
corporations affected, is slznlflcanL ,
License fets or taxes Imposed upon those
conducting a particular business or conduct
ing it in , a particular way have long been
recognized as valid exercises of the legislative
power and the privilege of doing business at
a corporation may be subjected to a license
lax even though that privilege or franchise
Is property and taxed as such. -.'
It Is claimed that this Is In reality a tax
upon property, viz : upon the franchise of a ;
corporation. But this argument overlooks the
feet that a license tax may be Imposed on
the use of property In' an* occupation or bust
ness, although the property Is already taxed
as such. So here, assuming that the license
tax Is upon the use of the very elements tha*.
go to make up the franchise of the corpora
tion, the fact that the corporation holding
the franchise pays a property tax upon it doeÂ» j
net preclude the Legislature from Imposing a
license tax upon its us* in the corporate bust
ness.. Indeed. In the very cases relied on by
counsel, the court suggests that there Is ut*
Identity In the two modes of taxation, saying.
"If the State can Impose a tax on the fran
chise of a corporation In the nature of an
excise or duty. It does â¢ not exclude the taxa
tion by a valuation made by an Assessor."
HV;- .;\u25a0;;-. law IS NOT SPECIAL.
Finally. It Is claimed that the law Is^peclal
because It relieves from the payment ot the
tax educational, religious, scientific and . char
itable corporations and corporations not -or
cnclzttl fr.r pecuniary profit. There Is noth
ing in our constitution which specifically pro
hibits exemptions from I excise or license taxes.
In' specking of exemptions In a law providing
for tn inheritance tax the \u25a0> Supreme Court o 4
tM* State said: ~ "As this ' tax is not '^ron
property. . but upon the * right of succession,
the constitutional provision that all property
rhall .he taxed according to Its value Is In
applicable. . The i right Of the Legislature to
impose an excise tax Includes the rleht tr>
select the subjects upon which It shall be im
posed." . â¢ V-i
It follow*, therefore, that the act under dis
cussion Is not open to any of the objection;
urft-d afffllnst it and must be held to be a
vaiM Mterclse of the .law-making power. Foi
the foregoing reasons the demurrer will be
sustained and the order to show cause dis
charged. , \u25a0
The act thus upheld by Judge Sloss pro
vides that all domestic corporations that
fail to pay the tax within the time fixed
shall forfeit their charters, and that for
eign corporations that . refuse to obey . Its
provisions shall be denied the privilege of
doing business In the State.
I independently or as an agent is one
that must be determined by the court,
however, '"as Schussler was non-com
mittal.
' .'WBLCTI ENJOYS TRIP. . .
Following Schussler, Thad "Welch
took the stand. He testified that Junior
came to him and asked him to paint an
exclusive landscape for Foster. He
started on the picture, he said, hut be
fore it was completed he was taken ill
and Junior took him to' Uklah, where
they remained for. four days, Junior
paying: all of the expenses. At the end
of the four days he had 'recovered his
health and he . returned to his , stufflo
and finished the picture. He received
: $200 for his work and no more, he said.
\u25a0 Mrs. / Welch followed her husband on
the stand. In answer to -a question as
towhether or. not she thought Junior
took her husband on the trip to Ukiah
In ordfr to nourish his friendship and
get : further i into his rood graces, she
said she had no such idea. She said,
however, that Junior told her .that
VFoster ; had -much money ; and would
prove to.be a' good Welch boomer.".
An effort , was : made ; by the plaintiff
to'introduce a letter Written by Junior
to "Welch, asking him, to write to Fos
ter, thanking him â¢ for .the commission.
Junior setting: forth ' the language that
was to ,be used in tho letter. Judge
Seawell refused to admit ; the letter,
however, ruling ;that It should have
been Introduced : when . Junior, wai on
the " stand. At this point . an adjourn
ment was taken until this afternoon at
2 o'clock."

PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
THURSDAY '. .SEPTEMBER 21, .1005
DECENCY WON OUT. '
THE Republican League has safely passed another stage in its
great movement. The Republican, city convention is organ
ized, its officers and committees are appointed, and it -is ready
for its deliberative work. A few weaklings stubbed their political
toes on graft and fell into the mud puddle of the municipal admin
istration, but the majority stood firmly against the storm raised
by the grafters in the gallery and on the floor. To do this required
some nerve and determination. One of the administration bullies
climbed upon the platform and assaulted an officer of the conven
tion, and was permitted to go without arrest by the police. Per
haps parties interested may conclude to teach the thug that disturb
ing a public meeting is not a pastime, and that assault under such
circumstances is not regarded by; the law as a personal pleasantry.
IF any more were needed to rouse the citizens of San Francisco
to the necessity of redeeming the city, it was supplied by the sup
porters of the administration at the first meeting of the convention.
Mr. Ruef,-who has publicly declared that he will not support the
nominee of the convention, was present, directing his forces ; V.in
person. He used in turn all of the arts of bullying and bluster, and
led the j-ow-yow' which continually disturbed the order of the body
and hindered its proceedings.
What was done to raise a riot, break the peace'and prevent the
execution of the people's will as expressed at the primary was the
work of the present administration. The rowdies who howled, in
terrupted and made the air foul were the flower and pick- of the
supporters of the administration. In them the decent taxpayers of
San Francisco see their present rulers. They are the power behind
the present government. They are the instruments through which
Mr. Ruef works his will upon San Francisco. If the citizens like
that sort of thing they can get more than enough of it by neglecting
to vote in November and letting that howling, bawling, brawling,
cursing and shoulder-hitting gang run the government for them.
As for Mr. Ruef, if he had any sense of propriety, any of the
feeling that should go with manhood, he would stay away from the
convention. Having announced publicly that he will support Mayor
Schmitz for "standing by" him "through all," he must know that
his presence in the Republican convention and every move made by
his followers therein mean an effort to 'aid the fortunes of the
Mayor. Under such circumstances even a motion tcr adjourn made
by a Ruef follower is out of order. They have no business in a
convention the action of which they intend to oppose. They tried
to cover the convention with mud and were cleverly snowed under
for their pains.
PRICE OF LIFE INSURANCE.
COST of life insurance is made a study in a paper by Allan
H. Willett of Brown University, published in the Political
Science Quarterly; and his conclusion is that we are paying an
excessive price for the services life insurance companies are render
ing us. Popular interest has recently been aroused 'in the subject of
life insurance by reports of extravagance and misconduct in the
management of some of the largest companies, and it is to be hoped
the interest will not exhaust itself on superficial phases of the in
surance question, but will get at the core of the matter, which
is an intelligent estimate of the cost.
One of the facts his study brings tt> light is that the actual mor
tality as experienced by nearly all .companies, is much lower than
the assumed mortality on which they estimate the cost of premiums.
Another item is the enormous proportion of lapsed policies. In the
experience of 31 companies he found that the regular terminations,
that is, by death, maturity or expiry, were only in the proportion
of 31.21 per cent to the irregular terminations of 64.79 P er cent, and
nearly all of these irregulars were by lapse or surrender. He finds
that the interest realized by the companies on investments is
higher than that on which they base their estimates of cost. In a
study of 24 companies it was found that 21.4 per cent of the value
of lapsed policies was retained as profit, the whole amounting to
over $8,000,000. The profits because of the actual mortality being
less than that assumed from the mortuary tables amounted to over
$20,000,000. The surplus held by the companies, and excused on
the plea that securities might decrease in value and that an unusual
mortality might occur, is unnecessarily large. In New York they
had $167,795,982 of such surplus in addition to "special funds."
From consideration of the reports he has estimated that the
present rates are too high even according to the present methods of
calculating cost, and more than that, the cost could be lowered,
for the expense of administration is extravagantly high. Willett
thinks that improvements .are practicable and that they would so
lower the premium rates as to result in a wider use of insurance by
people of small or moderate means.
A PERMANENT EXPOSITION.
THE proposition to expend several millions in maintaining in
New York City a permanent world's fair is bold, and worthy
the foremost city of the hemisphere. But California pioneered
the way for- it in the permanent exhibit of resources in the museum
of "the State Board of Trade. That exhibit, which is visited by an
average of 10,000 people per month, is to this State, its people, its
capacities, what the New York exhibit will be to the world, and; if
the latter equal it in completeness from the greater field it will be
the greatest effort yet made by man to bring together his works
and the resources of nature upon which they have been wrought.
In the permanent exhibit in New York this State should figure
in great splendor. In respect to what is produced by the soil and
the waters California can stand out as a microcosm. When lati
tudes wide apart and longitudes that have the world's great bulk
between them show in New York the products nourished their
far apart physical" conditions, California can show the same as ex
otics, finding in her soil and climate conditions as congenial as those
of their natural habitat. This is the one great fact which, this State
desires to impress upon the world. The pre-eminence which it
gives is shared with no other part of the world. We can grow, here
in perfection the fruits and plants of many lands, and platitudes,, and
when our exhibit in the great building in New York is known the
beholder will realize how nearly California is a world unto itself.
It is proposed to spend $6,000,000. on grounds and buildings to
accommodate this permanent exposition. It will be a combination
of park and hall, and will group all that is in, the plant gardens and
museums of the cities of Europe.* It is a bold project, but there is
no reason why it should not be achieved. It will make New York
famous above all cities and will add to our national luster. ; The
second world's fair was held in the Crystal Palace in New York.
These fairs have grown to their final proportions in the St. Louis
Exposition. The time in which they may be seen does not justify
the expense., If this permanent exposition be opened it will mean
that there will be no niore tempbrary efforts of that kind, and na
tions will in the future rival each other in the splendor and com
pleteness of such permanent expositions.) -

GIVING A LAST SALUTE
WE, about to die, salute you kindlyâ i
We, the very old, hail you, the yotrag.
Though the shows of earth we see but blindly,
And a leaden weight is on our tongue.
But our wan old hearts expand in pleasure
Watching how your spirits kindle bright;
And ;we dream us back to springtime treasure,
Old, dim ardors, ghosts of gone delight.
We relive* in you the chances splendid.
All the buffetings and all the gains;
Oh, the sense of time and time unended.
Ere the hope dies, ere the wonder wanes!
How you love and fight and taste of rapture,.
How your sleep restores yon to* the 'son.
How the sweet of every hour you capture
Haughtily as heroes e'er have don el
We have lived "and loved, as yon are doing J
We are. glad to see you ran the race;
Half you seem ourselves â your work, your wooing;
Your high stakes of glory or disgrace.
.Hail! Farewell! . Nor blame us If a sadnest
Clutches at our thread the while we gate IPfl
Brokenly, through tears, upon that gladness
Once was ours in exquisite old days.

IGNORING HEALTH LAW.
ARRESTED A TFERRT STATION
Salivary Offerings
Offend Master of
He Complains Also
of Ablutionary
Exercise.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
By Eooking a short wooden, pipe and
depositing salivary offerings upon the
tloor of the Key Route ferry station,
Rosa. Carir.elleta, a Spanish gipsy, re
pelled whatever artistic appreciation
her gaudy raiment and unconventional
yose may have invited. She sat with
â¢re of her nether limbs resting upon
âhe knee of the other and steadied by
r.er clasped hands, and her finely curved
mouth alternately black
clouds to the atmosphere and violated
the health ordinance which prohibits
expectoration in public places. Among
those who relished the picturesqueness
of the \u25a0woman's appearance and disap
proved her 6rnoking and spitting was
the superintendent of the depot, A. A.
Knox. and he it was who compassed her
arrest for fracturing the sanitary mea
sure hereinbefore alluded to.
When placed before Police Judge
lonian her eostumery improved the '
volor scheme of the tribunal and she
seemed to regard her position rather ;
WBmBBmBiKESto '
lightly, because her dark eyes sparkled
with merriment as they swept the
soberly-clad assemblage and the even
teeth, bared by , her smile, might be
envied by any one who does not invite
dental imperfection by indulgence in
tobacco smoking. But a swart and
stalwart man who stood beside her
evidently realized the seriousness of
the situation, for there was reflection
of misgiving in the keen glances he
shot at the bench.
Mr. Knox testified that the defend
ant was one of a Romany band in
causp at Berkeley, and that she and
other female members thereof daily
cane across the bay to earn money by
professing ability to reveal the future
of credulous women. The behavior of
the petticoated prognosticators at the
stations and on the ferry-boats was
indicative of bad breeding, to say the
least, for not only did they all commit
the offense there formally charged
against Rosa Carmelleta, but they also
utilized the ladies' retiring rooms
aboard the steamers for bathing pur
poses, a use for which they were not
Intended.
-AjThey do?" said his Honor, glancing
eearchingly at the smiling face of Rosa.
He apparently perceived nothing there
corroborative of the superintendent's
statement, for it was with incredulous
tone he added, "Are you sure of that?**
Mr. Knox was quite sure that ladies
had complained to him of having visit
ed the retiring rooms to arrange' a
wind-tossed coiffure or adjust an awry
hat and finding the toilet facilities mo
nopolized by gipsy women Indulging in
sponge baths. "These gipsies are a
great nuisance." was Mr. Knox's sum
ming up.
"It was for the disciplining of Ro
many nomads that England's first vag
rancy law was adopteji," quoth the
Judge, '"and although that law has been
enforced for centuries the gjpsv re
mains a vagrant. This band at Berke
ley, however, is reputed to possess
wealth, and with cognizance of that
report I fine this defendant $50. The
severity of the punishment allotted to
her may, have deterrent effect upon
others of her tribe who feel inclined
to defy the law or shock society."
So the woman went back to prison
and the" swart man informed the -court
that he would hasten to draw from her
bank account in Oakland . the sum
requisite to obtain her freedom.
â¢ â¢â¢\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢
. Harry Pedlow. a lilliputlan heater of
rivets at the Union Iron Works, was
, accused of drunkenness in a public
by Patrolman W. Flynn, a per*
r test Goliath In stature and width, and
the testimony went to show that the
â¢ small man provoked his arrest.
The policeman was on -, duty at the
Potrero when the rivet heater accosted
him wita these words: Tm a blood
drinker and; must fight, so yoÂ«i*d oblige
me by taking off- your coat a.Sil putting
up your fists, as I have too* much-re
spect for. the police uniform to whip
any man that is wearing it."^mSÃ
"I'm afraid I might catch cold if I were
to doff my- coat," said the officer, pleas
antly. "But why do you want to whip me,
anyway?""
"It is this way."- replied Mr. Pedlow.
"You see, I drink blood down here' at the
slaughter-houseÃ for my: health, and ' the
more I drink the more I want to: fight,
and the bigger a man is the greater is my
desire to do him. You're about as big as
they're made nowadays, but I don't want
to chow disrespect for the police by, lick-

ing you while you have on that coat.
Please take it off and let us get to work.
I may do as much to accommodate you
some time."
I "It's against rules for a cop to disrobe
, while on duty." said the giant, "so 1
j guess that to prevent you displaying lack
of respect for what my coat stands for
I'll have to run you Jn." '
There was no show of resistance on the
i blood-bibber's part. With a sigh of resig
nation he passively permitted \u25a0 the police
nÂ»an to pick him up 'twixt forefinger and
thumb and at arm's length convey him
to the nearest lockup. When he was
searched there two lottery ticKeta were
found in one of his pockets, but as they
turned out to be counterfeit Judge Fritz
not only declined to recognize them as
ample basis for an additional charge, but
dismissed the complaint for drunkenness
because of the little man's unshakable
respect for the police institution.
â¢M. J. Grifiin and a lady companion
were sauntering at Twenty-second and
Valencia streets night before last, when
they became convinced that a young
man was systematically shadowing
them, so they slowed their gait to en
aole him to pass them by. if he so de
sired, and then the lady almost swooned
with affright when she saw a revolver
in the young man's hand and heard the
hammer of the weapon click most
ominously. The pistol was not aimed
at either Mr. Griflln or the lady, but the
former felt justified in causing the
youth's arrest. The policeman discov
ered that the pistol was empty.
In the caurt of Judge Mogan the
prisoner said his name was Robert
Brown; that he did not intentionally
dog the footsteps of his accusers and
that he clicked the revolver as ' he
walked past them simply because he
desired to assure himself that the
weapon would not fail him if it should
ever come to pass that he found it con
venient to shoot anybody. He has been
given until to-day to frame satisfactory
explanation of why he carried the re
volver at ail. -
Patrolman George Meyer positively
identified Mrs. William Ellis as a
woman he saw driving; a horse and
buggy at furious speed in Golden Gate
Park on the night and about the time
her husband, whose alias is Sampsonr
was alleged to have -been fleeing- from
ex-Pugilist Harry Foley. whom he had
attempted to "hold up" and who shot
him in exchange of courtesies.
Patrolman Budd, who dwells on Cole
street, swore that soon after the time
of the alleged frustrated robbery he was
standing at the door of his domicile
and inhaling refreshing atmosphere
when he saw a woman drive at rapid
speed out of the panhandle and back
into it again, but he could not identify
that woman as Mrs? Sampson. The
horse and vehicle, however, he de
scribed minutely and the description
tallied, with that of the rig which Mrs.
Sampson subsequently drove to her
home.
After several other witnesses had
been examined and disclosed nothing
of importance. Judge Fritz continued
the hearing until to-morrow. ;
Robert Clayton, employed at < the
Union Iron Works, was intoxicated
when he clambered astride the richly
caparisoned steed of Mounted Patrol
man Bates as it stood at the door of
the Potrero police station and then
dashed away at breakneck speed on the
animal's back. Judge Conlan fined him
130, the' owner of the horse having
opined that Mr. Clayton did not intend
to steal it.
George Hardy, a* lumber surveyor,
told Judge Mogan that unknown
enemies of his had hired Joseph Glea
son and a man" named Lang to waylay
and beat him. He held to the unknown
enemy theory because he had never
provoked the wrath of either of his
assailants, nor did their attack upon
him seem to be Inspired by desire to
rob.
Gleason is in custody and charged
\u25a0with batteVyand the police are'^seek
ing Lang. : . J'l'i ..
I Several persons who had played the
"dart- game" operated *y, M. F. Laven
thal at 805 Kearny; street ' elucidated to
Judge Mogan the intricacies of the same,
with the result -that Mr. Laventhal was
pronounced a vagrant and a thief and or
dered to appear for sentence to-day.
The "sure thing*% device consisted of a
target embellished with various -designs,
the central one ' being, a crimson heart;
i and the game â¢ was ; to, pierce the heart
[ with an arrow thrown from a measured
I distance. Mr. Laventhal 'assured all com
ers that he would give 'a gold watch; to
the person who pierced the \ hearth after
paying a small ;â¢ sum of .money for the
privilege of trying to 'do so," and certain
"cappers" In ; his ; employ did pierce .the
i heart at will, thereby enticing less sophis
ticated visitors to endeavor to do like-,
wise. One ruralist expended $12 in futile
endeavor to pierce the heait, while a rellow
player repeatedly won a gold watch and
instantly sold >it to Mr. Laventbal \u25a0 for $5
spot cash, saia fellow player subsequently
turning out tSbe a "booster."

RobertUÃ Love, representing-; the L^wis and

HÂ« ' has " come to California on business con
nected with the fair, \u25a0which he declares is ap
proaching Its closing day with increased at
tendance and : every other indication of a . suc
cessful uuderta.klns. Discusslns the exposi
tion last evening Love said: .\u25a0 ' .
â¢'While it has never . been i claimed ; that the
Lewis and Clark Exposition Is 'as ': large or
diversified In -the way of ; exhibits aj was the
St. Louis exposition. It certainly is a great
attraction' and has been highly praised to even
those who : were prominently identified with
the exposition in St. . Louis and in Chicago.
California has unquestionably made a won
derful exhibition at the Portland " exposition
and is keeping up the record ; for attendance.
Just before I left Portland Commissioner Wig
gins informed me that 35,000 Californlans had
registered at the State building since the fair
opened, which exceeds the attendance, at Cali
fornia's building at the St. Louis during the
entire period of that exposition, by 3000.
"We expect that the reduced railroad rate
from various points on this coast to Portland,
which goes into effect Monday, will materially
increase the attendance at the exposition dur
ing its last days. We -have, communications
from different points, some of them as :lar
south Â»s Arizona, stating that many. large
parties are being formed to visit the exposi
tion within the next week : or so. ; One â¢ great
advantage Portland has had in handling the
large number of people that have visited the
exposition Is the fact, that it was able to fur
nish ample hotel accommodations, : for which
the visitors were not compelled to pay ex
orbitant rates. At no time during the rush of
traffic has Portland appeared overcrowded."

of .the Second Ktginient, National Guanl
of '? ( 'alif ornla. -Â» Is ;at liinfj of the past,
"owing: '.to' the fact that It refused to
pai-a.de* on ; Metnoriul day in this city
because the ' l^iu ies ' of the G. A. : R. had
ei : gaged a nor-unlon drum corps. Itis
held by J the authorities that, the J>and
refused jtof obey orders and ."' that *, this
warrants ; its ; dismissal. '_. Governor Par
deei as commander in: chief. on:the rec

will â¢\u25a0 order " that the band be ; mustered
out! \u25a0;.'"; In hia recommendation to tha
Governor, General Lauck makes the fol
lowing" statement:.
The organization In question refused to pa
rade .on : Memorial day," and It Is questionable
If . the c organization \u25a0 could be - depended on "to
parade at any time under similar circumstances
to ' those â¢ existing " as mentioned, - this ' being thÂ«
second ofTense ; of this * kind committed by ; this
organization. Â«::;. â¢\u25a0 - . -
\u25a0: Whtn: the members of an organization of the
National Guard 30 far . rorget their duty as to
refuse, to parade because 01 , their ''connection
with \u25a0â¢\u25a0 a ' labor union on ' a Uay saqred ito " the
memory, of . those- brave men . who in the Mexi
can War. Civil War ' or the war with Spain
Kave ,( their \u25a0 lives Â» to - their country, it 13 time
that measures .b? '\u25a0- taken to \u25a0\ Â»d the service of
such an \ organization and , I therefore recom
mend: that the organization be mustered out of
the service. V _ .
' This recommendation \u25a0Is not made for the
reason that th-Â» organization mentioned Is con
nected 'â¢ with - a labor union, .. but because the

â¢aid: "Beat :nformaticn hankers have is to
the effect that the Bank of England will mark

A Hoseate Prospect. -
J. 6. Bucfce & Co. of New York take the
following very uuliiFb view of the -trade and
stock outlook :
# "This is a year of big things. Dividends
liav<? been increased to an Â«rtent never before
njuiUed in the history of this 1 country. The
corn crop is the largest on record and the
crops of winter and Â«pring wheat are very
larre. The cotton cPoj> is moderate but all.
theee crops will be marketed at satisfactory
\u25a0jt!c*Â«. j So far as the steel and ircn Is con
cerned ther* is not only great activity at the
preser.t time, but thÂ« promise for the future'
is brilliant. Official prices In many lines do
cot reflect the actual market. Â« Premiums are
tf.r.g pe.!d tcr Immediate delivery. Rail or
ders to the araount of 831.000 tons have al
ready been placed for 190 C. The production
of structural steel and of the lighter grades
tt fir.iehed cteel and pig Iron is very large.
Copr^r production is large and prices steady at
16*3 C Commercial business is large and satis- ,
'actory. Railroad earnings continue to rtflect ;
a heavy volume of traffic, and the monthly \
Â» . -r~.e-r.ts coming to hand show heavy in- i
creases both in the net and gross earnings, j
Notwithstanding these fatisfactory conditions,
there has been no overproduction as yet.
Prices are high, but with a continuance cf
business prosperity sooner or later the public
,vr*.'.l come into the market and prices will
rÂ«-ech a level higher than at the present time, '
ar.d probably much higher than values Justify."

New York -tuck Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20. â Nothing in the news
vhich became public to-day would account ade
quately for the reversal of speculative senti
ment from yesterday's depression. But the re
bound In prtces w&s an fffective demonstration
of the resiliency of the market from pressure.
It proves the assertion heard generally in the
neighborhood of the Stock Exchange that the
fioct'.ng eupply of etocks is scarce and pro
fetevonil bear traders, find difficulty in cover
ing- the.r Â»bort contracts. Considerable lines -of
ehort contracte were put out yearterday and the
buying to get back these stocks probably was
n;ost responsible for to-day's -advances. The
market continues narrow and professionel.
The ypertacular advance in a limited number
of Ftocks is not convincing evidence of a
widespread demand in the market In general,
and commission houses continue to complain
that the outside demand Is scanty. Holders
elSjiK to their Ftocks. however, and nothing
eefcrr.s effective to dislodge holdings except
the actual withdrawal of credit by which they
are held. The pressure on borrowers has
become less and the (reneral outlook becomes
* \u25a0 favorable that further- selling of 6tocks
twjr.e not to be exi-e-cted until the hardening,
tendency of the money ' market shall be re
newed. The course of the currency movement
thur far this week mates it unlikely that the
coming bank statement will show any notable
eh:tr.kage in the cash reserves, and the tniEt
corf i-anles are therefore relieved for the mo^
vmr: from the call to take over loans from
Â£ji?*Tjanks in order to enable the latter to
t-jJe down deposit liabilities, to keep pace
T.ith the inroads upon their cash. The sub
treasury's continued heavy debit balance -at
the clearins-houfe has left a email balance
to the advantage of the banks. Payment at
the any office for the first parcel of gold
bars on the import movement, which arrived
jreFterday, figured in to-day's sub-treasury
debit balances. The stock market will see
further arrivals of pold, which will serve to
relieve if not entirely to effse't a renewed
drain on banking reserves. The rise In ln
t'-rior exchir.se vn New York Indicates the
1. im.;ih; demand of the Interior on this center
for the "time being. Foreign stock markets
eoemefl to . indicate to-day that the Increase
expected in the Bank of England discount rate
has been effectually provided against. .Reas
suring statements in regard to the Moroccan
equation served to ailay apprehension on that
f>oirfc. The New York market was in conse
cuenc* freed from the pressure from the for
Â«\gr. felling, and this â¢ contributed Aiaterially'
toward allowing the recovery in prices. The
most notable movements -oÂ£ the day were
traceable to local influence*.
Report* of important developments in the
Northern Securities settlement were revived
effectively in connection with the approaching
annual meeting of the Great Northern and
Korthera PacScc The rlee 111 that group of
stocks stimulated some sympathetic strength
in other railroad ehsres. ~ _
The revived. 1 strength of Canadian > Pacific
was due to reports of. prosperous conditions
which haye r sÂ«rvsd before to lift that stock.
Bates for foreign exchange rose decidedly
away from the gok! import point. Time money
rates were somewhat easier, but call loan
rates were held firmly at above 3 per cent.

the \u25a0 following: . deliveries of colonial Coal here
from Newcastle, ': N. \u25a0S. XV., namely: Boasuet.
3CBO .tons; Inversnald, 2200 tons; total, 3250
tons. On the \u25a0â¢ Coal ' loading list from \u25a0 New
castle there are twenty vessels;- -with a carry
ing .capacity of about' 34. Ct>o tons;- of- these
fly three are so far reported as having sailed,
this date last year -there were thirty-four
ssels , on -. the chartered - list, with . srw carrying
pacity of over : 85.0C0 tons. \u25a0 This . shrinkage
of 31,000 tons-. from last year shows very pro
nounced falling off in colonial Coal shipments.
The difference : does not appear to have caused
any disturbance In \u25a0 the > market prices locally. .
as the liberal deliveries from British Columbia
and Washington have fully. supplied all of our
requirements. ' : The collieries . belonging to the
Western Fuel Company have i not y*t - settled
the lr.'_ labor troubles: ;y Steps \u25a0 are ' being taken
and meetings are being held which should lead
to ; an . early , compromise. Reports are being
circulated that James Dunsmuir has been mak
ing purchases of new coal field*. undar the Do
minion- Government - that are reported to be
promising properties. Our present spring
weather is not inducing a generous consump
tion .of domestic - fuel and- for- steam purposes'

SUICIDE STORY
IS DISPROVED
â¢
City Chemist Bothe reported to the
Coroner yesterday that a complete
analysis of the contents of Archibald
Ralston's stomach revealed no traces of
poison of any kind. Now the authori
ties are at sea as to the cause of the
young man's death.
Ralston died in a hack after drinking
some sort of a mixture, believed to be
cyanide of potassium, in a room at Del
xnonico's on the 13th of this month. A
woman, known as Hattie Thiebault,
who had been living with him, was in
the room when he drank the potion.
He pleaded with her to drink some and
to die with him.
The Coroner's inquest on Ralston
will be held to-morrow and Dr. .J. L
Stephen, ousted chief surgeon of the
emergency hospitals and confidential
agent of Abe Ruef, will have some ex
planations to make concerning his con
nection with the case. In an effort to
shield the restaurant people Stephen
"butted in" on the case, which was in
charge of Dr. William Bauer, and 'had
the dying man put in a hack. They
started for a hospital â Stephen declares
the Central Emergency Hospital â but
the man died before the hack had gone
more than a few blocks.
Instead of taking the body to the
Morgue or notifying the police or the
Coroner's office* Stephen had the body
taken to Truman's undertaking estab
lishment. -Stephen placed the body In
charge of one of the assistants at the
undertaking parlor and Instructed him
not to say anything to the Morgue of
ficials about the case. His connection
with this case and a multitude of other
scandals caused the Mayor to have the
Unusual SliQe

When Ralston's mother, who lives in
the' East, was notified of his deathshe
declared that the suicide theory was
improbable. She said that her son had
long been a sufferer from heart trouble
and that the ailment was the cause, of
his death. The mother's theory now ap
pears to be the' correct one. Dr. Baci
galupi, however, declared that an ex
amination of Ralston's heart indicated
that death was due tJ poison. The
Thiebault woman says that the liquor
he drank resembled barley water.

so, "with. the; following result: '*,?\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0'}'. '
%'A. miner's s inch ; equals a flow, "of 12,960

estimated the : cost : of the structural .work
of the Spring system at $17,924,806.
