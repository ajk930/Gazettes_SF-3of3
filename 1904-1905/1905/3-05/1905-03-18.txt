DENVER. March 17. â bargain
made by leaders of the opposing Re
publican factions of Colorado to take
the Governor's chair from Alva Ad-
Ems and to seat in it Lieutenant Gov
ernor Jesse F. McDonald, after permit
tins James H. Peabody to hold it for
oue day, was carried to a conclusion
late this afternoon. ~
. In fulfillment of the agreement
which he made before the General
Assembly decided the gubernatorial
contest in his favor, James H. Pea
body resigned the office in which he
was inaugurated late yesterday after
noon. '
His resignation, of which W. S.
Boynton of Colorado Springs had been
custodian since Wednesday, when it j
was written, was filed in the Secretary
of State's office at 4:20 p. m. to-day.;
James Cowie, Secretary, of State, im- ]
mediately certified Governor Pea
body's resignation and Lieutenant '
Governor McDonald was then sworn
in as Governor by Chief Justice Gab
bert.
There was no further ceremony. .
DONALD SWORN IN.
Governor Adams was ousted and
Governor Peabody installed by the
General Assembly at 5 o'clock yester
day afternoon, and Governor McDon
ald was sworn in before 5 p. m. to
day. Thus in the space of less than
twenty-four hours Colorado has had
three Governors.
Governor Peabody transacted prac
tically no business of state while in
the office of Governor. He received
many callers, who urged him not to
resign, and also many messages of the
same import by telegraph and tele
phone. To all these he replied that
he did not care to hold the chair. He
said that he was tired of the worry
and excitement of his contest and
wished to go back to his hank in Can
yon City.
. BITTER FIGHT IS ENDED.
Half a dozen members of the Na
tional Guard patrolled the corridors
about the executive chamber during
the day as a guard for Governor Pea
body.
Lieutenant Governor McDonald re
luctantly takes the chair which Gov
ernor Peabody resigned after forcing
Governor Adams out. The Lieutenant
Governor has taken no part in the bit
ter fight over the Governorship, which
has been waged ever since the elec
tion on November S. He absolutely
refused to aid his friends in the Legis
lature in their efforts to have him
made Governor and as presiding of
ficer in the joint assembly he made
several rulings against the movement !
in his behalf. â¢
Senator Arthur N. Comfort h. presi
dent pro tern, of the Senate, becomes
acting Lieutenant Governor by the
elevation of the Lieutenant Governor
to the office of chief executive.
ADAM FT ELS AGGRIEVED.
"I am going back to my home and
jny business in Pueblo," said Alva Ad
em-, who was deposed by the General
Assembly from the Governorship af
ter having served sixty-six days of the
biennial term, for which he was in- I
augurated on January 10 last. "I am
president of a savings bank and I have
8 hardware establishment, so I have !
no fear about the bread-and-butter j
proposition.
"At the same time." he added, "I j
am by no means in a jocular frame of j
mind." I have been outraged and I
feel the resentment that is natural. I
However, if the people can endure it, I
can. My friends, many of them in i
the opposite. -.arty, have stood by me
Btanchly. I shall never forget their
devotion to the cause of right and
simple justice. I was advised by some
friends whose loyalty was supreme to
hold the office by force, but I neve
for a moment had an idea of accept
ing such advice. I mm for law and
order in the real sense of the phrase,
and self-sacrifice is a part of my duty ;
in adherence to that principle. I I
simply submit to the' outrage that
could not peaceably be prevented."
In his letter of resignation, addressed J
to Secretary of State Cowie." Governor !
Peabody stated that he contested the
gubernatorial chair, "believing then and
fully convinced now" that he received
a plurality of the lawful votes cast for
the office. It was a matter of duty to
the people of Colorado and the Repub
lican party that the contest should : - be
prosecuted. He considered the decision
of the Legislature seating him a com
plete vindication of his course. Con

VENEZUELAN
SITUATION IS
NEAR CRISIS
France Asks America
to Define Her
Attitude.
States Tnat Her Patience
Has Been Almost
Exhausted.
Regards the Action of Castro as Un
warranted and Has Nearly Reached
the Limit of Diplomacy.
WASHINGTON, March 17.â France
has officially informed the United
States of the action of the Venezuelan
Government agaist the French cable
company, which she regards as high
handed and unwarranted. While in
sisting that diplomatic means will be
exhausted in an effort to relieve the
situation, it is declared that President
Castro is rapidly exhausting French
j patience and thereby forcing Franca
i toward the limit of diplomacy.
France has invited the attention of
the American Government to the Yen
! ezuelan situation because of America's
interest in all South American affairs
and in order that it may ascertain the
; probable course of action which this
Government will take against Vene
zuela. It is the wish of the French
Government to act along parallel lines
so far as practicable.
The developments in the Venezuelan
situation to-day are regarded as the
preliminary step toward the relief of
the situation in Caracas, which Europe
as well as the United States has for
some time regarded with dissatisfac
tion. Early to-day M. Jusserand. the
j French Embassador, sent his first sec
retary to the State Department to in
, form the officers there of the suit of the
Venezuelan Government against the
French cable company and of the con
cern which the action has caused the
French cable company. The first sec
j retary, M. Portes, gave to Acting Sec
retary of State Adee the substance of
! the cable dispatch from Paris, and
asked him about the probable line of
action which this Government contem
plated in connection with the asDhalt
case-
It was impossible for Adee to com
, mit the Government on this point until
the Venezuelan courts had acted, but
he thanked the secretary for advising
this Government in the matter and
promised him information as soon as the
Government was prepared to make an
announcement. As the French ' secre
tary left Adee called at the War De
partment, where he had a lone con
ference with Secretary Taft.
It is pointed out that it is the wish
of the French Government to settle as
quietly Â«<= possibje its differences with
, Venezuela, and In case a French ulti-
m atum is followed by no relief in the
situation France will have well nigh
reached the limit of diplomacy.
Iji view of the unfavorable conditions
in Venezuela at this moment, the
French armored rrufser Duplelx and
| the protected cruiser Jurien de la Cra
! viere. which are now In the Caribbean
I Sea, will he retained in the vlcinitv in
definitely.
Although tAe greater part of the
North Atlantic fleet is soon to come
, north as far as Pensacola for tareet
practice, an adequate contineent will
remain in Dominican waters to Kuard
American interests there, and In case
of an emergency in Venezuela the
fleet at Pensacola will be in easy cruis
ing distance.

toward me personally.
"1 shall not attempt in this commu
nication to vindicate myself against
what 1 conceive to be a personal en
mity, unwarranted by the facts, and
ungenerous to a degree; suffice it to
say that I am now painfully conscious
of its magnitude.
I have always been and will ever
continue to be a faithful adherent of
Republican principles and doctrines,
and I conceive it to be the duty of
every true citizen to make personal
sacrifices. If need be, for the welfare of
the political organization to which he

â¢'Imbued with these sentiments, I am
constrained to the conclusion that the

of this State will be subserved If I am
now to retire to private life, hoping
thereby that my present effacement as
a political factor in Colorado will re
store peace and harmony, now so sore

this State."
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY. MARCH 18. 1905.
Advices from Changtufu are to the effect that the rear guard fighting is continuing almost uninterruptedly.
Hundreds of wounded are being sent north from Tie Pass. St. Petersburg is anxiously awaiting news from
General Linevitch, although it is thought that he has sufficient troops to beat off attacks by pursuing Japanese.

Linevitch Faces Difficult Task
ST. PETERSBURG, March 17. â A commission has been appointed un
der " the presidency of General Roop. a member of the Council of the
empire, to investigate the surrender of Port Arthur and act as a court to
deterailne the responsibility of General Stocssei.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 18, 1:50 a.
m.â Decided anxiety is felt regarding
the fate of the army in Manchuria un
der its new commander, no news of
military developments during the last
three days having been received. The
only dispatches from the front are the
brief announcements yesterday that
General Linevitch had assumed com
mand and that Kuropatkin was de
parting for St. Petersburg, disposing
of a rumor that Kuropatkin had com
mitted suicide, and the press Changtufu
dispatch filed the morning of March
16, and written t the station of Kaiy- |
van, which was then held by the Rus
sians. In the correspondent's opinion
i no pause in the Japanese advance is
probable for same time. The Russians
are losing heavily in the rear-guard
actions, ami Japanese columns are
reported to be pushing northward as
fast as possible to complete the en
veloping movement of the Russians.
General Linevitch will have a con
siderable accession of fresh troops in
a day or two, the Fourth European
corps being now at Harbin and de
parting southward. Military officers
declare that there arernÂ©\* 258 v GOO men
at General Linevitch's disposal in Man
churia and it is believed that this force
will be sufficient to cause the Japa
nese to exercise greater caution in
their pursuit.
Prince Khilkoff, who will leave St.
Petersburg soon to prepare the Siberian
railway for forwarding the new levies
which have been determined on, said
that there had been no breakdown as
yet and that he hoped as soon as tiav
igation opened it would be possible to
transport one-fourth of the outgoing
soldiers by the rivers and relieve the
railroad to that extent.
Although General Kuropatkin's
downfall was inevitable from a mili
tary standpoint, it arouses sympathy
in circles familiar with the long cam
paign that has been waged against
him by the general staff. General
Sakharoff was his open enemy and
General Dragomiroff his most severe
critic and many of his own subordi
nates were Jealous. Many epigrams
about General Kuropatkin's shortcom
ings are attributed to General Drago
miroff and the supercession of the for
mer at such a critical moment is di
rectly attributed to General Drago
miroff's advice, Emperor Nicholas not
giving ear to the veteran strategist in
military affairs.
General Lintvitdi is distinctively a
line officer with a long record as a
fighter. He j s almost as cordially dis
liked by the general staff as is his
predecessor, and there is al_o bad blood
between Kuropatkin and Linevitch
dating from a personal quarrel in the
days when Kuropatkin was comman
der of the Trans-Baikal aimy, whivh
led Linevitch to demand satisfaction.
Kuropatkin assumed the position that
he could not fight an officer of inferior
rank. The succession of this officer
will naturally increase General Kuro
patkin's discomfiture.
There is a persistent report that rail
road communications have been cut be
hind the Russian army. News Is
awaited with Intense anxiety.
A dispatch from Changtufu reports
that General Kuropatkin left there to
night for St. Petersburg.
OFFER BRAVE RESISTANCE.
Russians Engage In Constant Fight
ing While Withdrawing.
CHANGTUFU, March 16. (Delayed
in transmission.) â The rear guard ac
tion is continuing almost uninterrupt
edly. Soldiers wounded in the last
fight to the number of 17*0 were des
patched north from Tie Pass on
March 15.
On the morning of March 15 the
Japanese made the principal attack on
the Russian left and in the evening
attacked the right also. It is report
ed that several columns of Japanese
infantry, with cavalry, are moving
north a considerable distance west of
the railway with the intention of cut
ting the Russians from their base. It
seems evident that the advance move
ment of the Japanese has continued
for a long time and perhaps uninter
luptedly. The Russians, though fa
tigued with three weeks of constant
fighting, are offering a stubborn re
sistance in their withdrawal, although
not attempting to hold a position
which Is naturally open to a turning
movement. .
The wagon trains are gradually as
suming order, but many carts are
missing, including those carrying pri
vate supplies of food.
The distributing department, which
has done much good work at Kaiyuan,
will leave to-day for the north.
SYMPATHY FOR KUROPATKIN.
British Press and Public Criticises
Manner of His Dismissal.
LONDON, March 18.â No further
news regarding the situation in Man
churia or the whereabouts of Vice Ad
miral Kujestvensky's squadron has I
reached London.
The greatest sympathy is expressed
by the British press and public for >
General Kuropatkin and there is strong I
criticism of the manner of his dismis- ;
sal without a word of thanks for his
past services. General Kuropatkin is :
held to have been to a large extent a
victim throughout the campaign ut the j
interference of Alexieff and the grand ,
ducal party and never had a free hand
or proper support in men and meas
ures. Little or nothing is expected from
the appointment of uencral Linevitch, |
whose task is admitted to be almost
superhuman.
All the fc>i. Petersburg correspondents
of London newspapers are pessimistic.
The Dally Mail's correspondent
thinks the central fact of the situation
is that since the blessing of the Neva
on January 19 the Emperor has been a
prisoner at Tsarkoe-Selo and never
once has ventured to the capital.
"In the moment of the greatest na- !
tionaUemergency, needing the greatest :
sympathy between the Government ajti
the people, the ruler remains secluded
behind tripl* '.ars and Â»-ayonets as Â»e
raotg aml uhjsolutely ai<>of froni thfc j
people as if he were in another planet."
The Post's and other correspondents j
make gloomy predictions that the in- |
ternal trouble will prevent tho cuntinu- !
ance of the war. The Telegraph's cor
respondent says:
"If the command to mobilize is obey
ed the war will be prosecuted Indefi
nitely, despite the failure to float for
eign loans; but all symptoms point un
mistakably to the spirit of resistance
growing among the people. Men are
unfitting themselves for military ser
vices by chopping off fingers in such
wholesale manner that Grand Duke
Vladimir has turned his attention to
the matter. In a word, I am positively
convinced that an insurmountable ob
stacle to the continuation of the war
will be found in the dogged determina
tion of the Russian people to prefer the
risks of open disobedience at home to J
certain death in Manchuria or Siberia. I
This consummation will mark the si- I
multancous victory of the Japanese 'â 
abroad and Liberalism in Russia."
It is reported that steamers are char- ! ,
tering in London for Russian account
for Nikolaievisk. on the Amur River,
which will be used to run supplies into '
Manchuria, now that Vladivostok is
closed by the Japanese navy.
Japan is said to be placing enormous
orders In Australia for horses, which
are shipping as rapidly as steamers are
available.
The Post's correspondent at Shang
hai reports that a <'hines=e decree ap
points Chaoerchin Viceroy of Manchu
ria. After he has conferred with the
Japanese Minister he will proceed to
Mukden from the East.
RUSSIANS RETIRE NORTH.
First Set Fire to Railroad Station and
Supplies at Tic Pass.
WITH THE JAPANESE LEFT
ARMIES. Thursday, March 16, 10
a. m., via Fusan, March 17. â The pur
suing armies fully occupied Tie Pass
at midnight after a fierce fight. The
Russians retired north in confusion af
ter setting fire to the railroad station
and supplies.
The successful conclusion of the
army's mission makes the movement
the greatest of modern history. The
armies covered about ninety miles in
a fortnight, fighting practically every
Inch of the way. It Is not probable
that the Russians will make another
stand south of Harbin.
TOKIO. March 17.â A telegram re
ceived to-day from army headquarters
In the field says:
"The railway station at Tieling (Tie
Pass) is a splendid structure and its
arrangements equal those of the sta
tion at Liaoyang.
"The enemy's provisions and fod
der piled around the station were set
on fire and two-thirds of the nVaterial

"We have captured numerous spoils
but have had no time to investigate

SEATTLE. March 17. â A special
dispatch from Fort Valdez. Alaska, to
the Post-Intelligencer tells of the loss
of the Alaska Codfish Company's

ty men. The vessel was bound from
San Francisco to Sannack Island. The
dispatch says that the cargo of the
vessel and her figurehead have floated
ashore.
Alfred Greenbaum, manager of the
Alaska CodflSh Company, had not
been notified last night of the loss of
the schooner Pearl. He said the last
heard from her was on March 6, when
mail was received here saying that all
on board were well.
The Pearl was a schooner of about
100 tons. She was carrying fishermen,
who were engaged to work at the
c >dflshing station at Sannack Island.
She also carried a supply of stores
for the employes at the station. The
Pearl left this port on December 12
In command of Captain Emil Soder
holm. There were about thirty men
on the boat, most of them fishermen.
She has been on this run for many
years and this is the first time she has
met with any trouble. The schooner
was insured. _

RUSSIAN ARMY
IN BAD PLIGHT
Hordes of Chinese Bandits Said
to Be in Rear of Harbin.,
Task Confided to Linevitch By-
Czar Is a Desperate One.
ST. PETERSBURG. March IT.â With
the Japanese haxyrin*: on the heels and ,
flanks of the remnants of the broken
Â«uic defeated Russian army, General j
Kvropatkin, the old idol of the private !
Boldier, has been dismissed and dis- j
graced, and General Ldnevitch, com- j
mander of the First Arnly, is appoint- !
ed to succeed him in command of all
the Russian land and sea forces oper
ating against Japan. The word dis- i
era^ce is written in large letters in the. l
laconic imperial order gazetted, which
contains not â  single word of praise
and also disposes of the rumor that 1
Kuropatkin had asked to be relieved, j
â¢The Russian military annals contain j
no more bitter Imperial rebuke. While .
it was known that the War Council j
bad already decided to supplant Kuro- i
patkin after the Mukden disaster, the j
decision to confer the task of saving i
the remainder of the army on Line- |
vitch in the very midst of Its flight,
although bruited last night, came as a j
surprise.
It transpires that Emperor Nicholas,
upon the advice of General Dragomiroff |
and War Minister Sakharoff, deter- '
mined that the step was necessary J
when it became apparent yesterday :
morning that Kuropatkin while con
-centrating for a stand at Tie Pass |
neemed. unaware that the Japanese had â 
â worked around westward again and
practically allowed himself to be sur- .
prised. Old reports brought by Gen
eral Grippenberg regarding Kuropat
kiii's failing mentally also had influ
ence.
Under the circumstances, therefore, it
wa^ considered imperative, in view of
the exceedingly perilous position of the '
army, to turn over its command to
JLinevtt ch. who alone had been able to
bring off his array in order after the
battle of Mukden. His record during
the Chinese war had also demonstrated
his capacity as a commander.
Kuropatkin will return to St. Pet
ersburg forthwith.
RUSSIANS IN SAB PLIGHT.
The task confided to Liinevitch of
withdrawing â  hat is left of the great
army of 350.000 men to Harbin is a
desperate one. He is hemmed in on
all â =â â¢.<!<=Â«. General Kawamura pre
snmably is pressing northward
through the mountains eastward, ;
ready to swoop down. Generals Xogi
and Oku on the west of the Russian j
forces, the whole line of the railroad j
is threatened, if not already cut, and i
Chinese bandits are even reported to
be in the rear of Harbin- A consum
mation of the Mukden disaster is :
feared.
Napoleon's plight in the retreat
from Moscow with KutusofTs Cos- j
sacks harassing the starving, freezing
Frenchmen "was hardly as bad or dan
gtrous.
Nothing further has arrived from
tie front, but it is feared that the dec
imated battalions which had hardly
recovered from the demoralization of
the Mukden retreat have again been
thrown into confusion by Field Mar
shal Oyama's relentless, merciless !
pursuit.
The War Office greatly fear* that
more of the siege and field guns which
kuropatkin managed to save at Muk
den have been sacrificed in the hur- j
ried flight from Tie Pass. The â¢}â .:"=- i
lion of ammunition and food is also i
vital, as it i? known that the Russians I
were compelled to burn further stores j
at TV Pass, where the commissariat
was only beginning to feed the half :
famished troops when the new retreat |
was ordered. !
NO SIGNS OF YIELDING.
" Put even in the face of the possibil
ity of the complete loss of the array
t.nd the admitted fact that Vladivostok
is already possibly lost, the Emperor
ttill shows no signs of yielding. Prep
arations for continuing the war on a
larger . f than ever are proceeding. ;

\YIM. COMBINE. Â»
[ The War Council, It is understood,
has definitely decided that Vice Ad
mira' Rojestvensky shall continue his
voyage and giv* battle to the Japanese
in the forlorn hope of wresting control
of the sea from Admiral Togo.
If Rojestvensky is successful it is
claimed that an entirely new complex
ion will be placed on the situation.
In the meantime the completely dis-,
heartened ranks of those who are cry
ing for peace are growing, the strang
i est convert being Prince Mestchersky.
! who, as shown by his article in" the
i Grashdanin this morning, has become
i suddenly, a zealous advocate of reform,
i declaring that to make an end of the
war would not require more . heroism
than to conclude peace after victory.
He thanks God for sending defeat in
stead of victory, which, he says, would
only cover with laurels the gaping
wounds and miseries of the poverty
stricken people and the "badly fed and
badly clothed but heroic soldiers, justi
fied robbers of a peaceful country."
. The "glorified though faithless / ser
! rants of the Emperor" are exhorted to
penance after the present trials and
are urged to "give rebirth to honor and
â  duty."

ST. PETEKSBUBG, March 17.â An,
internal credit loan of J100.000,000 on
a 5 per cent basis is now being nego
tiated by the Ministry of Finance. The j
loan will be floated probably in a
short time. The price of issuance has
not been determined upon, bul proba
oly will be 93 to 95. The issuance
of this loan is entirely independent of
the French negotiations, winch have
BOt yet been concluded. Domestic
rentes will be issued for a long term
md will, as En the case of the internal
credit loan, not be subject to the ob â 
.igations of foreign loans. The pay
ment of the interest and principal will
oe in gold and probably will be tax
able. The determination of the Gov
ernment to turn to rtussia itself for
funds was taken only recently. Yes
terday the Minister of Finance eon-
Eerred with a number of the principal
oankers of "St Petersburg and Russia
generally and received the assurance
â¢hat the project was feasible. The
canks ara prepared to underwrite on
'jiiable lorms. The Government sav
.ngs bank, it is said, will assume $Â£5,
hhi.iMH) of the total, and* such rtnun
ial institutions as the Moscow Mer
hant, Volga and the Kama* banks are
veil able to underwrite large portions
<f the loan from their resources. A
iirector of a prominent bank said
:hat the banks of Russia could if re
,lined take the bonds and hold them
.n their own vaults. Questioned about
â¢he price, he declared that "93 would
>c very cheap," but he said the condi
ions on that point had not yet been
determined. Practically the loan is
-imilar in terms to the one issued last
nil, which was fully subscribed for
m half an hour.
BERLIN. March 17. â Inquiries
made of bankers here fail to confirm
the report that Japan has actually be-
negotiations for a loan in Berlin.
A similar report appears to have aris
en simultaneously in London, Paris,
Berlin and New York. Although no
negotiations have yet begun Japan is
probably testing the feeling of Ger
m.my toward a loan. The German
Government does not seem opposed
io the project because Chancellor yon
Bulow to-day, replying to criticism
of Germany taking the last Russian
loan, said it was merely a private
matter and in the same way Japan
was providing to obtain a loan.
The Frankfurter Zeitung advises
against investigating or speculating in

which have reached Frankfort, Lon

PEACE NOT POSSIBIiE.

ST. PETERSBURG, March 17.â
Many interesting stories of occurrences
at Tsarskoe-Selo are current in St. Pe
tersburg drawings-rooms, where some
times court news first leak out. The
most important statement is that Em
peror William early this week strongly
advised Emperor Nicholas to conclude
peace and tendered his good offices.
The Russian Emperor is declared to
havo declined, answering that it was
impossible under the p*sent circum
stance?. According to the story M. de
Witte, president of the Committee of
Ministers?, was present at the Alexan
der palace when Emperor William's
message was received and Emperor
Nicholas asked his opinion. M. Witte
is reported to have replied that he was
"ready to implore his Majesty on bended
knees to accept the advice, whereupon
Emperor Nicholas showed great dis
pleasure, and M. Witte again requested
to be relieved of his functions as presi
dent of the Committee of Ministers.
According to another story, M. Pan
nane, the Emperor's drawing master, a
real court favorite, is creditW with
writing the last manifesto.
Still another story is to the effect
that when General St^essel lunched
with the Emperor his Majesty did not
;<sk a single question about Port Ar
thur. So far as the Pannane story is
oncensed it is known to be the veriest
nonsense, and the others probably are
â !ily idle gossip in which St. Peters
burc likes to indulge. In view of the
alarming reports about the- peasant
agitation small bodies of troops have
been dispatched from Moscow and
oi her centers for emergency purposes
to the districts affected.
The mobilization order, it is expected,
ill call out the second reserves in
ny districts.

WAS CAUSE OF DEATH.
Honolulu Doctors Dispute Jordan s Version
A spirited controversy is in prospect over the cause of Mrs. Stanford"? death. Chemist
Shorev. who took a leading part in the investigations at Honolulu, and the three physicians
who were in attendance at the Moana Hotel yesterday issued a statement disputing that of
Jordan and Hopkins and declaring that strychnine poisoning produced death. Mountford
Wilson says the crystals in the bicarbonate have by no means been accounted for, though
Jordan and Hopkins attempted to do so.
Attack the Theory
of Natural Cause
With Vigor.
HONOLULU* March 17.â Edmund
Rhorey, chemist of the United States
agricultural station, and Drs. Woo^i
Murray and Humphries have signed
a statement replying to Professor Jor
dan and Timothy Hopkins, who re
cently announced their conclusions
that the death of Mrs. Stanford wai
clue to natural causes.
They characterise the statement ol
these gentlemen as astonishing, aii'l
reiterate their finding that strychnine
was the cause of death. They â¢&$
[hit the publication of tho Jordan-
Hopkins opinion makes it incumbent
upon them to reply, and they give the
following reasons why the death musi
have resulted from strychnine poison
ing:
"First â .Mrs. Stanford died during
i characteristic strychnine convulsion,
Which was seen by Drs. Humphrif?
and Murray.
"Second â There was a post mortem
rigidity, identical with that peculiar
to cases of this class of poisoning.
"Third â The postmortem examina
tion revealed no other cause of death
from any affection of the stomach or
intestines. They contained no undl
jested food and were in a healthy
condition.
"Fourthâ The post mortem examin
ition confirmed in every respect th-3
evidences of authenticated cases of
strychnine poisoning, and these, com
bined with the fact that strychnine
was found In the bicarbonate of soda
svhich was used by the deceased, fur
nish a chain of evidence that will
vithstand the fiercest assaults."
Continuing, the statement goes on
to discuss the testimony of Miss Ber
ler. Mrs. Stanford's secretary; of
May Hunt, her maid, and that of Drs.
Humphries and Murray. It quotes
medical authorities regarding the
symptoms of poisoning by strychnin?,
md reaffirms the positive opinion th it
strychnine poisoning caused f .he

.JORDAN-HOPKINS STATEMENT.
.Version ; That Has 'Aroused the Chem
ist and Physicians.
The following is the statement Presi
dent - Jordan and Timothy Hopkins is
sued before â¢ their departure from
Honolulu; that is now likely to be the
cause of an interesting controversy: â 
,â¢â  . * â  . rj'i 5 â¢i---' .ii .-. <- j, j? ,-i-1
', In Â«our judgment,'^ after ai;eareful consider
ation of all th*> fa<;ts"?brougnt to our knowl

Mrs. Stanford was not due to" strychnine .pois
oning ' nor ;to ! Intentional wrongdoing on the
part of. any one. ': " ; '.-' , . ;->â  â '{ l.^
We find i in the ; statements *of Â« those who
were with Mrs.' Stanford' in her last moments
no evidence that any of the 'characteristic
symptoms of strychnine poisoning were pres
ent. v 'â  ' ; >'i ' â 'â  . â  â â â¢'â â¢-; '- <
, .-We think it probable that 'death was due
to - a combination of conditions and circum
stances. Among- these we may note ; in con
nection with her advanced age â  the unaccus
tomed exertion, the surfeit of unsuitable food
and the unusual exposure during the picnic to
which fhe wont on the day of her "death. ;.'.
These conditions, were ; perhaps somewhat
aggravated by the presence of strychnine and
other drugs In the medicinal capsule and pus
sibly also by. the presence. of the small amount
of strychnine contained In * the . dose of bicar
bonate of soda. : ;. -
The occurrence of this strychnine in the' bi
carbonate of soda has not yet been . explained.
The fact* that . it wag ; not ,in - excess of usual
medicinal proportions suggests that its , pres
ence was due either to the : ' error of .* a phar
macist,: or else that the combination was pre
pared for .'tonic purposes. '" ;. :. Â .
. We must recognize that the preliminary hy
pothesis of accidental poisoning seemed a nat
ural one under the extraordinary circum
stances. -â¢ We regard it, however, â as being
without foundation, and wholly Incompatible
with the evidence in our possession. -
HEAVY SURF
DOES DAMAGE
SAN DIEGO. March 17. â The un
precedented surf during the last few
days has caused considerable damage
to property on the o*cean front of Cor
onado. The waves made serious en
croachments on the fine boulevard
leading from the hotel northward, and
portions of the roadway were washed
out. The owners of some of the hand
some cottages nearest the ocean were
concerned during the height of the
storm and preparations were made to
move the residences farther back. All
danger is now past, the sea having
gone down.
The damage to the boulevard can
not well be estimated, but it will run
v.ell into the thousands. The great
hotel was never in danger. It is well
protected by a breakwater, but as an
additional safeguard many thousands
of bags of sand have been used to
strengthen the approaches from the
sea.

GIBSON AND CLEARY BUSY.
New Strychnine Lead Falls to Ma
terialize, Ldke All Others.
Detective Ed Gibson of the Police
Department and Detective Cleary of
thr- Morse agency are still tracing
down suggestions that come to them in
letters that ire received by Captain
Burnett every day as to possible clews
iln the Stanford mystery. No import
ant developments have resulted thus
far.
Yesterday an anonymous letter
stated that the poison with which Mrs.
Stanford was poisoned had been pur
chased at Mayhew's drug store on
Fourth street ny some member of Mrs.
Stanford's household. There was a
flurry of excitement for a while among
the detectives, but investigation at the
store revealed the fact that no strych
nine had been sold there for over a
year.
Every drug store has now been can
vc.BÂ«ed in San Francisco, Oakland. Ala
rneda, Berkeley, San Jose, Palo Alto
and other surrounding cities and
towns, in fact every place in this part
of the State where poison might have
been purchased by either Mrs. Stan
ford or by members of her household
or anybody who might be connected
with the case. The painstaking work
has been without result.
Mrs. Stanford had traveled much
v/ith her household, however, and the
r.frychnine may have been bought in a
far distant pan of the world, the.more
J likely so if a deep plot was concocted.

Captain Burnett to
Form His Own
Conclusions.
"1 am not to be drawn into any con
troversy as to what caused the death
of Mrs. Stanford at Honolulu."
Captain Burnett, head of the city's
detective department, was emphatic in
manner and speech when he made this
statement yesterday.
"It makes no difference to me," he
continued, "what the officials and doc
tors of Honolulu or what President
Jordan arid Timothy Hopkins have to
say about it. I am awaiting the return
of Detectives Reynolds and Callundan
with the evidence they gathered in the
islands and I shall be guided solely by
the light they will be able to give me."
Then % the captain explained that he
had concerned himself thus far with
the; Poland water poisoning in, this
city and that investigation toward un
raveling the Honolulu mystery had
beer, merely incidental.
. â  Burnett declared it to be untrue that
he representatives of the Stanford
estate have sought to hush up the
murder theory.
. "In all my numerous conversations
with Attorney Mountford Wilson," as
serted, the captain, "he .has insisted
vigorously that no stone be left un
turned to solve the mystery and to
prosecute the guilty party. His wishes
applied to both the. Honolulu and the
San Francisco . poison cases."
'Opinions of President Jordan. Tim
othy Hopkins or of .any other Stanford
representative to the contrary not
withstanding. Captain Burnett says he
will arrive at his own opinion from thÂ»
facts that will be available. He de
clares that he: is acting altogether in
dependently of the Stanford represen

STATE AND NATION BY SONS OF THE EMERALD ISLE.
PATRON'S NATAL
DAY IS OBSERVED
WITH REJOICING
IRISH SOCIETIES CELEBRATE
Frank J. Sullivan Delivers Stirring Oration in
Afternoon, and Evening Is Spent in
Singing and Merry-Making.
Green was the triumphant color yes
terday throughout the city, State and
nation. Green ribbons were on the
dresses of the lasses and on the coats
of the lads and in the places where the j
sons of Erin congregated many a. fer- j
vent prayer went up to heaven for the I
freedom of their native isle. '<
' St. Patrick's day. the day set apart I
in memory of Ireland's patron and in- .
.tercessor, was one of glorious reunion ]
of many old friends and the bringing
together of Irish hearts in a universal
bond of patriotism.
In the Majestic Theater were gath
ered hundreds of Ireland's sons and
daughters. There the Irish societies 1
were represented and befittingiy ob- 1
sered the day. They witnessed the rep
resentation of Irish life and Irish hero
ism in the oft-repeated but ever soul
stirring history of an Irish patriot,
Shamus O'Brien.
Representative citizen* of San Fran
cisco were there who are of the sub
stantial stock that has helped to make
this city what it is. Heads of the city
government, judges, lawyers, profes
sional men and business men fratern
ized.
The programme, which was to have
. been long and varied, was necessarily
curtailed owing to the late start of the
afternoon's proceedings, which began
at 2:30 o'clock. It was nearly 3:30
o'clock before the first act of the play
commenced.
Michael Donohoe, chairman of the
afternoon, was the first speaker. His
remarks referred to the purpose of the
great gathering and the hope of Ire
land in her sons. At the conclusion he
introduced the orator of the afternoon.
Attorney Frank J. Sullivan.
Mr. van's speech was in itself a
gem of oratory and will be treasured
with pleasant memories by those who
â were so fortunate as to be in the vast
audience. His clear, strong voice made
.every syllable heard in the auditorium
and. his manner of delivery and person
al magnetism added weight to his
*vords.
I Throughout his discourse the speaker
â¢was frequently interrupted by applause
which in several instances approached
tumult. On one occasion in particu
lar was the audience delighted. When
â¢ the speaker referred to the battle of
Fontenoy. the struggle "made memor
able by Irish pluck and heroism, he
raised a small cannonball, brought by
him from that historic field, and spoke
of its having been wet with the blood
of Irish and English combatants, the
applause was deafening.
SULLIVAN'S OKATIOX.
The repeated references throughout
the oration to â the one desire of Ire
land a heart, to be free and independ-
e nt, re-echoed in the hearts of his
hearers. In the peroration, when he
described the future of Ireland, the au
dience stamped and shouted enthusi
astically. Among other things, he
â¢said: V.
If I â¢ret* not of IrUh parentage I would

naturally sympathize with her people because
they have been oppressed. Just as 1 sympathize
with the Poles, the Jews, the Finns, the Boers
or other nationalities that are striving to de
mand their right as freemen. Years ago as I
stood by the grave of the great Edmund Burke
at Beaconsneld. England. I asked myself why
this great Irishman, the friend of America,
the greatest man in literature since Shakes
peare, died poor and " without proper recogni
tion of his great talents. The answer came to
me like a stone irorn a catapult â because he
was an Irishman, and because England could
not bear the idea that a mere Irishman
should dictate her policy. Yet out of Edmund
Burke, in the opinion of Rufus Choate, could
be cut .-.> Mackintoshes. 175 Macaulays, 40

greater than Pitt and Fox together. This
great man's â¢brogue" to the day of his death
was as rich and pure as if he had lived all his
life in Connaught and is evidence of the fact j
that in him the Oaelic tongue lost a great i
pupil and Ireland a great patriotic national
leader, yet the English call Burke an English
man.
GREAT MEN.
Whatever prepossessions I had in favor of
Ireland were intensified by the speeches of
William E. Gladstone, John Bright and Wen
dell Phillips. It was my provllege to hear
these great orators on "Ireland." I naturally
said if such men as Gladstone and Bright de
nounce the past and present conduct of Eng
land, I do not see why I should not agree
with them. To me it has always been a mat
ter of surprise how Ireland has retained her
nationality, especially when, as Macaulay re- :
marks, England persecuted her because Ire- ]
land's misery was necebsary for England's
happiness. I presume tor England's happi
ness, after 700 years of conquest, it Is neces
sary to keep a standing army and a strong
, police force among a people absolutely with
out criminal instincts, and make them pay for
the expense and then call this free govern
ment. Tbe Eastern empires and . those of
, Greece and Rome live for us in the narrative
,of the chroniclers only. Their glory and pow
;â¢t have passed away. Their names are a re
, minder of the transitory nature of human
grandeur.
History tÂ«lls us that nations are subject to
the universal law of decay. The shores of
time are strewn with the wrecks of empires.
Not only does the outward structure of gov
ernment disappear, but the living pillars of the
â  edifice â people â never to rise again.
| Some kingdoms perish through inherent weak
ness; others from conflict with a stronger
power. When an exception to this apparently
unrelenting law Is found; when an ancient na
j tion presents itself wli'ch has never felt the
i breath of decay, but exhibits to-day the same
j vltaity, energy and undying power that It dis
played centuries ago, it is truly a cause of pro
found astonishment to thÂ« historian and of de
light to him who can call such a nation his
own. The greatness of a country Is often
I traced In the monuments of past ages. Is It
i not wonderful to behold a race which refuses
to be Judged by Its architectural wonders
alone, but raisins aloft its voice, exclaims:
"Study not the Inscription on my ruins... Behold
me in the bloom of youth; the glow, of health
Is on my cheek and the sparkle In my eye."
California is not forgetful of her debts to
the children of Erin.- Know. Ireland that
thy sons and their descendants In this golden
land love with undying devotion thy cause,
i thy name and thy history, and offer up un
ceasingly a prayer for thy freedom. When
will Ireland bÂ» Independent, with all the at
tributes of nationality? It needs not the
prophetic vision of the seer to perceive that
the dying wish of the patriot will toon be
fulfilled. Darkness still enshrouds Ireland
But the day star is even now trembling- on
the horizon s verge. I look into the future
and what do I behold? Erin's sky begins to
show signs of the coming day of freedom
Streaked at first with grayish lines,- it glows
and gleams with the golden flashes of the
dawn. Crimson clouds appear in every direc
tion. Suddenly silver rays dart from the
heavens. Then slowly- rising, as from a pur-
Pie throne, the god of day and liberty to
Lrin is seen. HiÂ« golden arrows wing their
way over her mountains. His teams gild the
hills and valleys of the dear old land.
And now at last a scene of unsurpassed
grandeur and loveliness strikes mv eye. As
the pun whose light ha been so long hidden
by the clouds of tyranny ascends the meridian
; in all the glory of supreme and unequaled
sovereignty and casts his lustrous light upon
a once more happy and contented people Ire
land springs to her feet, and casting off the
fetters of ages, In the fullness of her Joy ex
claims. "Behold, I am free!"
When the applause following: the
final outburst of eloquence subsided,
Edward P. Hogan, secretary of the
united Irish Societies, was Introduced i
and warmly greeted. He read the
memorial and resolutions of sympathy
and encouragement that are to be for
v.aided to the patriots in the Emerald
Isle. The resolutions are as follows:
A?eembled to celebrate the national festival
i of the Irish race, we send greetings In th â¢â¢
name cf the Irish people at San Francisco to
our brethren In the motherland and to the
Clan-na-Gael scattered throughout the world I
We congratulate the Irish people at home and !
abroad on their unswerving devotion to the '
principles and Ideals lor which the Gaelic raf- I
has stood, and we appeal to them In the name
of the patriots and martyrs of Erin to carry I
on the fight until these principles shall trl-'
Tjmph.
We renew our claim that Ireland is enti
tied to her place among the nations of the
-art. .: a.id our national aspirations can never
he satisfied until that claim has been realized
While congratulating the people of Ireland on
the grand struggle they have made for relig
ious and political rights, we assert that noth
ing less than complete independence can sat
isfy us. We remind all lovers of liberty that \
Ireland, eminently capable of working cut' her
own national salvation, and entitled by all the
laws of the nations to self-government, ha
been held in subjection .by British bayonets
has been plundered by unjust taxation and by
absentee landlordism, and that higher educa
tion Is denied the vast majority of her people I
because of their religion. We stigmatize Eng
land, which parades as the friend cf liberty; as j
a canting hypocrite as long as It continues to .
deprive the Irish people ; of their national and
political rights. We appeal to Irishmen at j
home and abroad to make the independence of
the motherland the one aspiration of their
lives, and to rebuke, by every means In their
power, the insolence and the pride and the de
signs of the historical enemy of, the Irish 'na
tion. We warn our ; fellow citizens of the |
machinations' of England, ' and ' we rejoice that
the United States Senate has I had the wis- I
dom and patriotism to reject 1 any entangling i
treaty with the perfidious nation that made I
treaties only to break them.
We rejoice at . the new , life that - has come
into Erin through "the revival , of . the Gaelic !
tongue and Gaelic literature, tradition and
story, music and song, dance and games. These '
are the emblems of Gaelic nationality. These '
have preserved Ireland a Gaelic land and sus- I
tamed the Gaelic spirit. i They are our most '
patriotic national heritage and ' their . revival i
is the most patriotic work that Ireland can un- j
dertake. The Gaelic language should hold the
place of honor in every school .of Ireland, re- I
ligious and governmental, and we appeal to the
priests and people of Ireland to restore . It ,to
that place. Every child should be given an
opportunity to speak the language of his fath
ers and to know the history and literature of
his country. We appeal to the Irish people. in
the Lnited States to see that their children
are taught In school thÂ« splendid story of their
fathers land â bravest and most Inspiring
story of any nation. A knowledge of : Irish
history would be the best antidote against the
slanders and misrepresentations which - have
been spread against us by our enemies. We
demand that full - Justice be done to i the his
tory of Ireland In our schools 1 and 'that an op
portunity be given to the children of Irish par
ents to learn the story of their ancestors.
We call upon our Congressmen > and " Sena
tors to provide . for a worthy monument to the
father of the American navy. Jack Barry

memory of this gallant Irish- sailor, and th*
time has come , when that debt should be -in

BEVY OF DANCERS
Knights of the Red Branch
3lake Merry at Their
Annual Ball.
Native Sons' Hall presented a gala
sight last night, when hundreds of the
Knights of the Red Branch and their
fair friends glided gayly over its pol
ished floor to the strains of sweet
music. The affair was the thirty-sixth
annual ball of the order and proved to
be one of the most successful events
ever given by the society.
The hall was decorated with a pro
fusion of green in honor of Erin's pa
tron saint. Long before the appointed
hour the big hall was filled to over
flowing. Irishmen and Irishwomen
from all over the city were there to
take part in the festivities and pay a
tribute to the memory of St. Patrick.
The grand march started shortly be
fore 10 o'clock and was led by Joseph
Kelleher and Miss Josie Eagan. The
merrymakers kept the fun going till
the small hours of the morning. The
aftair was in charge of the following
committees:

to the condition of Ireland in Its connection
with England.
One of the most appropriate and in
teresting incidents of the day then oc
curred. J. D. Condon stepped to the
j front of the stage, and. after explain
ing that the programme of speeches
tnust necessarily be shortened to allow
the play to proceed, said there was one
tlung that must be done. With that
he asked President Michael Donohoe
to Ptep forward and presented him
with a handsome shield as a gift of the
United Irish Societies. Mr. Donohoe's
embarrassment was smothered by the
storm of applause that followed. The
shield- is of gold and bears in enamel
the crossed ilags of Ireland and the
United States, with the words, "St. !
Patrick's day, 1805." On the reverse
is engraved: "Presented to Michael
Donohoe by the United Irish Socie
ties."
As for the play, every one is familiar
with the life story of Shamus O'Brien,
ono of the foremost of Ireland's pa
triots. Charles Erin Verner, the well
known actor, whose portrayal of
Irishmen has won for him renown
throughout the country, appeared in
the title role. In the cast were mem
bers of Bishop's company and the
characters were all acceptably handled.
I'ryse Mackaye was the villain that
caused most of the trouble between
Jane Kelton, the heroine, and her
hero lover. Frank Mac Vicars, Elsie

were all good. The special matinee

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, March 17.â Special music
at all the masses at St. Vincent's
Church marked the religious observa
tion of St. Patrick's day in Vallejo.
To-night in Farragut Theater a musi
cal and literary programme was ren
dered by San Francisco and home tal
ent under the auspices of Vallejo
Council, No. 13, Young Ladies' Insti
tute. The features of the programme
were the vocal solos by Miss Marie
Drobaz McGlade and Lillian Byrne of
San Francisco, Miss Gene Toland, a
pretty and talented Vallejo girl and
Oscar Franks and M. Morgenstein of
San Francisco. Miss Kathryn de Celle
of Vallejo danced Gaelic dances and
selections from Moore's poems were
given by Miss Lucy Lamb. A one-act
skit by Stewart Allen and J. L. Sulli
van of Vallejo closed the performance.
McADIE THINKS STATE
WILL PROMT BY RAIN
Damage Wrought by Downpour More
Than Counterbalanced by the
Good Done Crops.
Professor McAdie says that the
storm which has done so much dam
age has departed for the East. Clear
weather is expected for to-day. Yes
! terday the showers were light and the
wind was less fierce than during the
Â«.J'rly part of ths week.
McAdie is sure that the generous
r&infall will be of great advantage to
the State, in jpite of the Inconvenience
to travelers and the demoralization of
traffic in Southern California. The
cattlemen will be particularly benefited
by the improved pasturage. The
lanchers will receive unexpected re
turns from their grain fields. The
railroads will be benefited by the in
creased traffic which will result from
unusually large crops.
The rainfall in the southern part of
the State has been larger than usual,
but the precipitation is less by several
inches than that of other years. Mc-
Ad'e thinks that if the railroads pre
pare for a heavy rainfall every few
years the damage which may result
| will be infinitely less than on this occa
| mton.

PRESIDENT PAYS A TRIBUTE
TO THE SONS OF ERIN.
Executive Is Guest of Honor at
Banquet in New York.
Commends Study of Celtic
Literature to Colleges.
NEW YORK, March 17.â President
Roosevelt was the guest of honor to
night at the 121 st annual dinner of the
Friendly Sons <jf St. Patrick. He was
roundly cheered by more than 600
members of the society and its guests.
He made a speech before the society
closing a day full of friendly greetings,
during which he gave his niece away
In marriage. The banquet was given in
the golden dining hall at Delmonico's.
The society was obliged to refuse more \
than 2000 applications for tickets. The |
main banquet hall and the annex were
beautifully decorated with festoons of j
the Stars and Stripes, into which was
woven effectively the green and gold j
flag of Erin.
The banquet tables were banked with j
rosts and carnations. They were set
off by garlands of green and gold elec- |
trie lights strung diagonally across the ]
hall.
Immediately back of and above the j
seat of the President were the Gaelic i
words "Cead mille failthe" in letters \
of tire. To the right and left of the
guests' tables were fine medallions of ;
Washington and Roosevelt, illuminated |
by electric effects. The contrast of j
Washington and Roosevelt was sig- j
nincant. The Friendly Sons of St. Pat- |
rick entertained Washington in 1782 as j
the general in charge of the colonial ]
armies. Roosevelt is the first President
as such that the Friendly Sons of St.
Patrick has entertained.
ENTHUSIASTICALLY GREETED.
The President arrived at 6:30 p. m.
and for half an hour held a reception.
Then, accompanied by Judge .â¢. ltzger- ]
aid, the president of the society, and
toastmaster, President Roosevelt was
conducted from the hall to the dining
room. Many of the guests waved the
Stars and Stripes and the flag of Erin
enthusiastically. The President was
introduced by Judge Fitzgerald and in j
his response said:
"I wish to read a telegram received
to-night. It is a sop to one of my
well-known prejudices. The recipient
was a father to-night when he came
to this banquet. Now he is a grand
father. Here is the telegram:
" 'Peter McDonnellâ Patrick just ar
rived. Tired after parade. Sends his
regards to President. He ts the first
on record since Teddy attended the
Friendly Sons' dinner. He is a fine
singer. No race suicide in this family.
Weighs eight pounds and looks like the
! whole family. All is well.
â¢* 'Robert McDonnell.'
"And now gentlemen," continued the
President, "I want you to join me in
drinking to the health of Peter McDon
nell, and abo-ve all to Mrs. McDon
nell."
TRIBUTE TO ERIN'S SONS.
President Roosevelt then spoke as
follows:
Long before the outbreak of the revolution
there had begun on the soil of the colonies
which afterward became the United States,
that mixture of races which has been and
I still Is the most Important feature in our his
' tory as a people. At the time early In thÂ«
i eighteenth century when the emigrants from
I Ireland began first to come in numbers to
| this country, the race elements In our popu
lation were still imperfectly fused, and for
i some time the new Irish strain was clearly
| distinguishable from the others. There was a
j peculiarity about these Immigrants who came
: frcm Ireland to the colonies during the eigh
teenth century which has never been paralleled
in the case of any other immigrants whatso
: ever. In all other cases, since the very first
: settlements, the pushing westward of the fron
tiers has been due primarily to the man of
native birth. But the immigrants from Ire
j land in tha seventeenth century pushed boldly
! through the settled districts and planted
! themselves as the advance-guard of the con
i quering civilization on the borders of the In
! dlan-haunted wilderness. In Maine and North-
I crn New Hampshire, in Western Pennsylvania.
; Virginia and North Carolina alike, this wu
i true.
By the time the revolution broke out these
! men had begun to mix with their fellows
I of other stocks and they furnished their full
share of leadership In the great struggle
i which made us a nation. Among their num
j ber wu Commodore John Barry, one of three

In the second great crisis of our country* â¢
historyâ the period of the Civil â thÂ« part
played by the men of Irish birth or partntairÂ»
was no ltss striking than It had been In thÂ«

I am â  now addressing are of the Immortal

The pÂ«ople who have come to this country
from Ireland have contributed to the stock of
our common citizenship qualities which ar*
essential to the welfare of every great nation.
They are a masterful race of rugged charac

I hope .that an earnest effort will be madÂ»
to endow chairs In' American universities for
the study of Celtic literature and fop research
in 'Celtic antiquities. It is only of recent
years that the extraordinary wealth and beauty
of thÂ» old Celtic sages have been fully ap

large a Celtic strain in our blood, cannot af

Long Statement.
OAKLAND, March 17.â Mrs. Kate
Greiner of Los Angeles, the mother of
F. J. Goldstein, who was "killed while
with David Kiniry a year ago last No
vember when Policeman Smith met his
death, has come to the defense of her
dead son. Kiniry is now on trial for
the killing of Policeman Smith, and he
is making a plea that Goldstein killed
the policeman. Mrs. Greiner has come
from Los Angeles' to testify. While on
the witness stand this, week she ac
cused Kiniry of trying to save his neck
j by casting the charge of murder on her
dead boy, j and now she has issued a
statement : in which she. tells the story
!of how Kiniry worked" his way into
her family, and finally how she met
.Kiniry hen he was in the hospital in
Los Angeles and accused him "of hid
ing behind .the silence of the dead in
; order to protect himself. - . ;
Mrs. Greiner Is now at 543 Twenty
fourth street In. â  this cijy. * where she
will remain :uritil'the":tdkl of â  Kiniry
ends next week. The testimony in the
case is all in and nothing remains but
: the arguments and the deliberations of
i the jury. Mrs. Greiners statement is
as follows: â â¢ < . . .
-, My son first met David Kiniry in San Fran-
MM when I was keeping 1 a rooming house at
MM Turk etreetr-- His mother and he came to
my house and- hired- â¢- room.â'-At' that time
my win was working at the Philadelphia Shoe
House, at 10 Third street, and he ha* thÂ«
highest recommendations from his employers
win* that he stood â  weir: before ' he met
this man: . Kinlrj went ' to work for Boyson's
drug Mere, on Mission street. './. >:
My son was always 'a. devoted child and
worked hard; He worked during â¢ the day and
attended , Jbuelnees college at . night. . Joe. as
we called -. him, went to work at Oxnard and
Kiriry went to live, with h1Â» aunt In Vallejo,
and I sold out my house and went to Lob An
peles. Later: Joe came home 'to Los Angeles
er.d was attending business college there.
Kiniry came to Lob Angeles to our place and
renewed' hi* acquaintance .with 'my son. He
Induced Joe to go with him to San Francisco
i on March 23, lÂ»03. and they remained In
| that. city until September 27, when they both
came to my home. . They remained a while
and then went back to San Francisco. That
was the last time that'l'eaw my "son until
! saw his dead body .at the Oakland Morgue.
After Kiniry was ; arrested I hÂ«id a. conver
sation with him at the Los Angelas Receiv
ing Hospital. I visited him in company with
my other pon and daughter. . Kiniry Â» asked
my eon to shake hands with him, but my son
replied "No. Â«ir." There was a few moments'
silence and Kiniry ; said. "Mrs. Greiner, all
those friend* that know me as Fred West
have come to me and sympathized and shaken
hands with me; none have refused."; re
plied. "David, If those friends that know you
as fred . West : had the name story to tell as
my eon and I. and had lost a son and brother,
they would not stain their hands. with yours."
Kiniry replied, "You are right." Then I said:
â¢ "Haw is my. daughter, ; who. had. as much con
fidence in you as I. I had been worrying about
my son Joe. and seemed to ' have a ' presenti
ment that some harm might come 'Co him. My
daughter tried to comfort me and said,
â¢Mamma, do 'not worry; Joe la all right;. You
know he .is so good and . careful, and besides
David would let no harm come to Joe. > You
know he always seeks - good company.' . And
now you are - the very cause of hi* death."
Kiniry was silent. . ,
I said: "David, what have I done that you '
should take my poor boy and bring thin dis
grace upon j us? ' Could " you , not have < taken a
boy who had no home, or loved ones and was
already in your evil path*? Why take a good
and loving 'son, the - pride of my life? You
well, knew .how much we thought;. of Joe."
Kiniry answered: "I never associated * with
bad people. .: Yea, , Joe â¢ was a. very good i boy."
I said: "And you have not hurt poor Joe and
us enough. â¢- but you are : trying , to put murder
upon him. You can't Injure JoÂ« or myself any
.more, but It. la - theaa - two innocent : children
that you are * trying â to â  ruin, and tto cast - a
Â«-tain upon their whole life. by trying to fasten
upon their. brother a crime that he never com

plied. .1 "You . very well , know." " He said, "No
mother shed more - tears , than 'I < did - for Joe
the . night he died." ... I asked . him. "What -do

iHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 18. 1005.
TWO mothers played
important and dra
matic parts in the
trials in Oakland of David
Kiniry for the murder of
Policeman Smith of the
Oakland Police Department
and of Mrs. Lena Koehn
for the killing of her hus
band. Mrs. Greiner, mother
of young Goldstein, who was
shot by Smith, has signed a
statement in which she
rtiarges Kiniry with having
exerted undue influence over
her boy. Aged Mrs. Koehn,
when her dead son's wife
was called to the stand to
testify, leaned forward and
asked, "Lena, why did you
kill my boy?" The old lady
then gave way I to violent
sobs. The court and coun
sel zvere much affected.
Young Mrs. Koehn entered
a plea of self-defense, and
said that her husband liad
threatened to take her life.
She shot hint merely because
he seemed determined to kill
her if she showed any hesi
tancy to defend herself.

right to publinh summons in the ac
tion it has brought against Mrs.
Eleanor Martin, her sons and others
interested to rondemn South Beach

Mrs. Martin, the petitioner says, has
long absented herself in Europe and it
is impossible to personally serve her
with summons to appear and defend

Old Man After Losing. Mind
Forgets About Coin He Had

RENO. March 17. â William Prill
man, aged 80 years, died in the asylum
here yesterday apparently a pauper.
At one time he was well-to-do. He
came from Rye Patch, New, a few
days ago. When the old man passed
away a message was sent to a friend
at Kye Patch, who immediately start
ed a search of PriUman's cabin, and
beneath a board found a can con
taining $1500 in coin. He arrived here
to-day with the money and arranged
for the old man's funeral. Prillman,
it appears, dreading to die a pauper,
buried his money before he lost his
â¢mind and then forgot It-
It is probable that more, -wealth is
hidden about the cabin and a further
search -will be made.

MEETS HER DEATH
IN FLAMES.
Awful Fate of the
Wife of Fresno
Painter.
Brave Tramps Risk
Their Lives to
Save Woman.
FRESNO, March 17. â The screams of
a woman burning to death brought two
tramps from their blankets in a wood
yard and in the face of scorching
flames and at the risk of their lives
they dragged the woman into the open
air. She was taken immediately to a
hospital, but died from the effects of
the horrible burns she had received.
The woman was Mrs. J. J. O'Neill, the
invalid wife <$l a painter employed by
the Santa Fe. One of the tramps is
named G. W. Reed, the other's name
is unknown.
Mrs. O'Neill had been ill for several
days. This morning about 7 o'clock she
reached for some medicine and tipped
over a lamp at her bedside. The flames
set flre to the bed covers and Mrs.
O'Neill was burned from head to foot.
When the two tramps rushed into the
house smoke and flames were belching
from the door of her room. Guarding
his face with his arms Reed dived into
the flames. He was followed by his
comrade. Mrs. O'Neill had rolled from
her bed and was lying on the floor
moaning and crying. The men seized
her and though the flesh of her arms
came off In their grasp they carried her
tv the porch. An ambulance took her
to the Burnett Sanitarium, where she
died at 1 o'clock this afternoon.
Reed says that his home is in Stock
ton and that he came here in search of
work.
SAYS HUGHES
IS A HYPNOTIST
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 17.â Another al
leged victim of Dr. J. ESdwin Hughes
visited him in the County Jail at Yaki
tna to-day and denounced him as the
man who hypnotized her at Florence,
Colo., where she formerly lived. She
claims that under his hypnotic influ
ence she became subject to his will.
He wrecked her 14-year-old daughter's
life, she declared, and arranged for her
to feign insanity. Instead she con
fessed to her husband and Hughes left
i town.
This woman says Hughes told her
he had a wife in Chicago and that he
was ponnected with a bank and train
robbery in Nevada. The woman's
name Is withheld by the prosecutor
and the Sheriff of Yakima County at
her urgent request. She moved to the
vicinity of Yakima last month from
Portland, having come from Colorado
last year.
Last fall Hughes induced Mrs. Hatch
of Elmira to elope with him. Her hus
band chased them through six States,
finally locating them in Seattle. From
Denver Hughes had sent Mrs. Hatch's
5-year-old daughter to Chicago, tak
ing Mrs. Hatch and her 15-year-old
daughter May to Ogden. He there
married the daughter with the moth
er's consent.
Hatch, who is a prosperous farmer,
is prosecuting Hughes to the full ex
tent of the law.

COLD IS FOUND
IN THE GUTTER
Groat Excitement Follows
Strange Discovery of Citi
zen of San Bernardino
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN BERNARDINO, March 17.â
There was a strange scene at the cor
ner nf Third and E streets in the heart
of ihe business section of this city this
forenoon when it became noised about
that- some one had found gold in the
gutter. In a short time there were
scores ot men and a number of women
squatting in the street along the gut
ter, digging In the gravel and mud with
toothpicks, pen knives, pencils and hat
pins, greedily picking up the little yel
kiw particles. This continued until
late in the day.
Calvin Baker, 1 a mill man who has
done much prospecting, was the nrst
to make the discovery- He was stand-
Ing on the curb when his trained eye
caught the glint of gold in the gutter.
He had picked up about $3 worth when
others were attracted by his actions.
The crowd grew rapidly and excitement
ran high. It is estimated that about
$15 worth of gold was picked up in the
course of a block.
It was learned that several cartloads
of sand had been hauled from Lytle
Creek for the construction of three
large buildings on B street. Some of
this sand had b?en left in yards and
l;ist night's rain, which amounted to
practically a cloudburst, washed the
sand into the gutter where it attracted
the attention of Baker. Lytle Creek
is known to contain much placer gold,
but it is so scattered that mining was
not thought worth while. Still many
enthused by to-day's find are prepar
ing to go out to the creek in the moun
tains, hopeful that the floods may have
bared great stores of gold.

DOCTOR MAKES
FALSE REPORT
NEWPORT, Or., March 17.â The
preliminary trial of Mrs. Green,
charged with killing E. G. Sharratt at
Lutjens, resulted in her being com
mitted to-day to await trial in July.
Dr. Thomas Parker of Toledo has
been arrested and charged with be
ing an accessory after the fact. Dr.
Parker conducted the autopsy at the
Coroner's Inquest. Evidence Intro
duced tended to show that for a
money consideration he had attempt
ed to cover the crime by reporting to
the Coroner's jury that Sharratt came
to his death from abscess on the brain
and not from a bullet wound. This
the jury refused to believe or be in
fluenced by returning a verdict of
death from a bullet wound. When
the body was brought to Newport it
was examined by Dr. F. M. Carter,
who tound that a bullet had been re
moved from the spine. Parker was
admitted to bail in $500 bonds. The
husband of Mrs. Green was held for
trial at his examination several days

Woman Who Says Attempt
Was Made to Kill Her Is
Principal in Legal Battle
Around the gold of aged Juana Mar
shall, whose rÂ«cent tale of an attempt
to poison her received police attention,
the legal battle is waxing warm. Juan
Jose Arzave, the Montgomery-avenue
tonsorialist whose friendship for Mrs.
Marshall was well exploited during the
investigation of the alleged attempt to
murder her, has come forward with a
vehement protest against the appoint
ment of Rltihard D. Marshall, Juana's
nephew, as her guardian, and in Mar
shall's petition Arzave alleges he sees
most sinister motives.
Arzave, in his protest, alleges that
ho is the attorney in fact of Mrs. Mar
[ shall, and that she has expressed a de
sire that his power of attorney be not
annulled. Marshall, he further avers,
has demonstrated that he is not a fit
and proper person to have tha custody
of the aged lady of wealth.
"Juana Marshall, though advanced
in years, is not insane," Araave con
tinues. "Richard D. Marshall and one
Robert Donohue, notwithstanding this
fact, have virtually made a prisoner of
Juana Marshall, keeping her in her
rooms at 1112 Powell street, where they

met at the door by Donohue. Dr. Trevino was
refused admittance and Donohue. placing hit
hand on his hip pocket, said: "Doctor, I am
armed. You have a family and had better
look out."
This protestant believes and further alleges
that on March 7 Marshall and .Donohue.
caused Juana Marshall to execute a will in
their favor, in keeping with their conspiracy.
This proteetant further asks that the petition

CITY ENGINEER CLASHES
WITH BOARD OF WORKS
<<*omniissionorr. Claim Woodward Ig
nores Them to Take Orders
From Supervisors.
The unpleasant relations existing
between the Commissioners of Public
Works and City Engineer Woodward
culminated yesterday when Mayor
Schmitz notified Commissioner Aigel
tinger that Woodward had com
plained to him that he (Woodward)
was not being treated fairly by the
board named. Woodward feels ag
grieved that Chief Deputy Donovan
of the bureau of streets has been
called into consultation with the
board at its meeting. He thinks the
City Engineer should act in the ca
pacity of adviser to the board.
Aigeltinger told Mayor Schmitz that
the Board of Works resented the fact
that Woodward preferred to take or
ders from the Board of Supervisors
instead of the Board of Works, which
had appointed him. A specific in
stance cited was that when Woodward
was asked by the Board of Works to
file an estimate of the cost of work
required to prepare plans for Mission
and Fourth streets improvement
Woodward submitted a brief state
ment showing that it would cost a
large sum, but he went into details
with the Supervisors' Finance Com
mittee as to the number of draughts
men and other employes required. The
Mayor advised the officials to try and
get along more anaicably.
NO AGENT IS NEEDED TO
COLLECT REBATE TAXES
Assessor Dodge Says Property Own
ers May Receive Return of Spe
cial Levy Without Expense.
Assessor Dodge yesterday called at
tention to the fact that some persons
are constituting themselves agents for
the collection of rebate taxes on the
special levy for schools and hospitals.
The method is to get the tax bills
from property owners on the plea that
it is necessary to have an official agent
act in the matter. Dodge says all that
is necessary is for the taxpayer to pre
sent his bills to the Auditor for veri
fication and a demand will be drawn
in his favor for the amount of taxes
paid under the special levy. The
Board of Supervisors will then ap
prove the demand and there is not
one cent of expense entailed thereby.
In one instance a property owner
figured that he was entitled to a re
bate of $80, but the agent handed him
only $40, thus retaining half of the
claim for his fee.
Auditor Baehr was advised yester
day by his attorney that there is no
merit in the point raised that the con
stitutional amendment permitted of
the return of only those special taxes
that have been protested. Any one
who paid such taxes, whether he pro
tested or not, may get his money
back by applying at the Auditor's of
fice and presenting his receipted bills
for 1902-1903.

The question as to what action the

theaters of this city do not cdmply
v.ith the existing ordinance was the
subject of a conference of city of
llcJals yesterday in the Mayor's of
fice. Those present at the conference
were Mayor Schmitz, City Architect
Shea and Commissioners of Work*
Aigeltinger and Maestretti. Abe Ruef
was also in attendance.
The proposition to close the the
aters under the instructions from the
Grand Jury was discussed, but was
abandoned as being too drastic.
It was suggested that the matter be
passed back to the Grand Jury to take
action. After further discussion the
matter was left open, it being under
stood that the Board of Works will
hold an early meeting to outline its
intention and mode of procedure in
the premises.

WIT OF WOMAN
FOILS SLEUTHS
SIX DETECTIVES ARE BAFFLED
Wife of Pursued Man Refuses to Allow Officers
to Open Trunk in Which Spouse
Was Hiding.
PORTLAND. March 17.â The wit of
a woman was too much for six city
detectives last night, and though their
quarry was in a big trunk, which was
handled several times by the sleuths
during their visit, he escaped and Is
still at liberty. Incidentally the tongue
of Joseph Day, well known as a thief
catcher, brought him into trouble, and
when he left the house It was with a
scratched and torn visage.
Hugh Testard is wanted at St. Louis,
Mo., for forging names to railroad tick
ets and for contempt of court. His
partner, John Caspary, is now under
arrest in St. Louis. Portland police
were notified from St. Louis of Tes
tard's presence in this city, and after
several days' work 467 Seventeenth
street south was found to be his abid
ing place. From dark until 10 at night
the sextet of sleuths watched the
doors and windows of the house. When
they tired of waiting for something to
turn up one of the number rapped on
the door. He waa met with smiles, by
Mrs. Testard, who had been observing
her beleaguered position from a
window.
Mrs. Testard invited the detectives to
search the house. They looked every
where they imagined a man might be
concealed, but in vain. At last the de
tectives found a large trunk, and on
lifting one end from the floor found
that It was heavier than ordinary
trunks are. They asked Mrs. Testard
to let them open It. but she firmly re
fused. A pile of stuff in a closet showed
It had been hastily removed from the
trunk, but as the officers were without
a search warrant they dare not open it,
and they finally left with their fingers
in their mouths.
Day used very offensive language in
the search. Mrs. Testard stood tt as
long as she could and then invited him
to go into another apartment for a pri
vate Interview. Once inside the room
the woman blew out the lamp and then
set upon the detective, scratching and

in-law, Mr. tote, had pur
chased a lot together, but as
McCune paid the money to the Cem
etery Association the land was in his
name. He buried his wife in the up
per half of the lot, and Mrs. Holden
buried her husband in the lower half.
Then trouble came between McCune"
and Mrs. Holdup, and recently, when
Mrs. Florence Donovan, Mrs. Holden's
daughter, brought her baby all the
way from Alaska to be buried near
her old home, .McCune refused to al
low the grave to be dug.
Mrs. Holden then brought suit
against McCune and was able to show
to the satisfaction of the court that
she paid for her half of the lot and
that she was entitled to it. and the
court made an order to th"iÂ« effect.

BERKELEY, . March 17. â The
sophomore and freshman classes of
the university have decided that the
', big "C " shall be built to-morrow
morning. The class men have been
organized into sections, with a captain
for each, and the men will work in

bit of architectural work.
Professor Soule of the engineering
department has aided the committees
of undergraduates in laying out the
plans for the "C" and with Professors
Christy and Howard has encouraged
the students in charge of the- project.
Professor Soule likens the big "C" to
the L* Conte memorial lodge, built in
Yosemite Valley, arid says that in the
same way that the lodge is a monu
ment to Professor LeConte's life and
.Heals, the cement "C" in future yeans
v ill be looked . upon as a memorial
by the classes that built it and will in
its history testify to the abandonment
of me objectionable features of stu

GAY YOUNG ARMY OFFICER
IS UNDER SURVEILLANCE
Lieutenant W. E. Goolsby Is Detained
Here as Result of Financial
Troubles.
Lieutenant W. E. Goolsby, Twenty
first Infantry, is now under surveil
lance of the military authorities at the
Presidio. The rosy path of the ten
derloin is reported to be responsible
for his predicament. The main cause
of his trouble is the claim made by
a woman named Decker, keeper of a
notorious resort, who alleges that he
owes her $340. Goolsby came here
with his regiment and Intended to sail ;
for Manila on February 1. He failed to j
make connections. He was then listed I
to sail on the transport Logan on
February 28. Again he failed to sail,
and it is reported that the Decker
woman, with her alleged claim
against him, was responsible for his
not being able to get away to join his
regiment. The military authorities
here look lightly upon the situation
and in all probability will not press
matters up to a trial by court-martial,
as the young lieutenant's relatives are
people of prominence and will un
doubtedly come forward and render
the needed assistance to get him out
of his trouble.
The Eighteenth Battery, Field Ar
tillery, in command of Captain D. J.
Rumbough, and the Seventeenth Bat
tery, Field Artillery, in command of
Captain G. G. Gately. who arrived
yesterday on the transport Thomas
from Manila, 1 - were speedily trans
ferred to the transport Buford and
sailed away north, where they are to
be stationed at Vancouver Barracks.
The Ninth Battery, Field Artillery,
tinder command of First Lieutenant
Edgar H. Yale, who returned on the
transport Thomas yesterday, are now
at the Presidio.
The movements of the Fourteenth
Infantry, which was scheduled to sail
from Manila for this port on March
15, are not known. Major C. A. Devol
said yesterday that either one of the
transports, Sheridan or Sherman,
should have sailed from Manila on
March 15, and in one of the vessels,
he presumed the Fourteenth would
come. He had no advices. There
were many rumors afloat here recent
ly that there was a possibility that the
Fourteenth might not sail on the 15th,
but would wait for the Buford and
then sail direct to the Columbia Riv
er, as it is to be stationed at Van
couver Barracks, Wash. The Four
teenth Infantry has been for two
years 'n Samar.
Major A. S. Dunning w<is equally
at sea on the subject, as no advicas
had reached him to-day concerning
that tesriment.
The transport Thomas, sailing on
March 31 for Manila, will carry the
Third Squadron of the Eighth Caval
ry, 275 Philippine scouts and forty
five 6-gnal corps men.

WEALTHY GIRL
MAKES DEBUT AS
PROFESSIONAL
OAKLAND. March 17.â When Hortense
Neilson presents Fannie Davenport's famous
version of "Cleopatra" at the Macdonough
Theater next Thursday night the occasion will
be one of ( vast interest to Oakland's "400,"
for on that evening Miss Pearl King, the
popular society girl and the petted daughter
of Capitalist Charles H. King, will make
her professional debut. Miss King has long
been accounted one of the most talented read
ers in this city and has taken part in many
of the most successful affairs of the smart
s^t. It wag to her splendid executive ability
tliat "Pinafore" owed its first success re
cently and it was just after that charity bene
fit that Miss Kins wi\j approached by the
manager O f ji; S8 Neilaon's company With a
very flattering offer. ' Although fitted for the
stage and an ardent enthusiast, Miss King
had not seriously contemplated a histrionic
career, but the opportunity that presented it
self wm not to be despised. In "Cleopatra"
the young aoeiety actress will nave an unim
portant part, though second to the leading
lacy, but , better opportunities for displaying
her art will be given her In "Magda" and
"Cymbeline," which will also be presented
here.
Miss King has signed with the company for
the coast tour only, but may go also to the
Orient and Australia. In the meantime the
smart set will have something to discuss in
this decision of the gifted society girl, Mid

MORGAN AGAIN
TO THE ATTACK
Continues His Speech in the
Senate Charging a Deal
in the Dominican Affairs
RESOLUTION PUT OVER
Believed That Upper House
Will Adjourn To-Day and
Treaty Will Be Shelved
WASHINGTON, March 17.â 1n thÂ«
executive session of the Senate to-day
Senator Morgan continued his speech !
of yesterday in which he disclosed the j
details of certain concessions sought in
Santo Domingo by Mr. and Mrs. Reader I
operating under the name of the Read- I
er Syndicate. Before the doors were ,
closed he offered a resolution calling J
for an investigation of Dominican af- i
fairs by the Committee on Foreign Re- j
lations. Later in the secret session he â 
challenged the Senate to adopt the j
resolutions. He said that if this were
done the charges he made yesterday !
connecting William Cromwell of New j
York with a movement to bring about ,'
the offering of the offices of the United
States to adjust the financial affairs of
the Dominican Government would be
proved.
Senator Morgan spoke to-day until
4:45 p. m., when Senator Foraker took i
the floor in defense of Cromwell. He
read a telegram from Cromwell deny
ing that he had had any dealings with
President Morales in connection with
the securing of concessions or interest
ing the Dominican Government in a
scheme to petition the United States to
take charge of its financial affairs.
Adjournment is looked for to-mor
row. It is not determined whether the
treaty will be recommitted or whether
it will be allowed to lapse without ac
tion of any kind.
When the Senate convened to-day
Senator Morgan sent to the desk the
account of the executive session pro
ceedings of yesterday, printed in a
Washington paper. The article related
to statements alleged to have been
made by Morgan in a four-hour speech
to the Senate yesterday.
When the reading was concluded
Morgan adressed the Senate, protesting
against the character of the report and
condemning any persons, whether
members of the Senate or not, who di
vulge executive session secrets.
He submitted a resolution directing
an inquiry into the protocol of January
31, lÂ»03, and the award to the San Do
mingo Improvement Company of July
14, 1904. He asked that the inquiry he
made to ascertain whether there was
any fraud or oppression used and what
had been the proceedings In bringing
about the execution and enforcement of
the award. On objection by Cullom,
the resolution went over under the
rules.
Teller called up his resolution of in
quiry and offered certain amendments
which brought it within the usual form
for resolutions of this character. He
provided for sending it to the Presi
dent instead of the Secretary' "f State
and put in the form of a request that,
if not incompatible with the public in
terest, the information in regard to
Santo Domingo be sent to the Senate.
Adoption of the resolution was objected
to by Cuiloin. Lodge and others and it
again went over.
During the discussion Teller took up
the subject of executive secrets and
said the trouble was that the Senate
tried to make secret matters which
should oe considered in legislative ses
sion. He referred to the fact that a
number of years ago ExpcuUvp Clerk
Young had been dismissed because
executive secrets had escaped. He con
demned this action by the Senate and
said after that the papers got better
reports than before,
Cullom said he had often thought it
would be a good thing to discontinue
executive sessions entirely.
"The papers seem to be getting more
neivs of these secret sessions than they
evpr did before, ' hf- said. "It some
times seems to me that we should
abandon such sessions entirely."
Carmack had read an allege*! inter
view with Representative Hull of
lowa, in which it was said that the
Japanese aspire to gain possession of
the Philippines and th<? United SJtates
may expect trouble in holding the
islands. The Senator declared the
views especially were in harmony with
representations made by the naval of
ficials in Eastern waters. Lodge had
read an interview with the Japanese
Minister denying that any such pur
pose was held by his Government.
Replies to Carmack were made by
Senators Dolliver and Allison on the
ground that the interview attributed
to Hull did not express his sentiments
and the Senators questioned the cor
rectness of the statement. Allison de
clared that if the views expressed
were entertained by Hull he stood
alone in such an opinion concerning
the Japanese Government. Reference
was made to the statement of the Jap
anese Minister and this was met by
Carmack with the statement that auch
I a reply was the very kind that could
be expected from the Japanese Min
ister under the circumstances.
Senator Spooner discussed briefly
the relations between the Philippines
1 and this Government and said he be
lieved the time would come when the
islands would have their own govern
ment. On motion of Cullom. the Sen
ate went into executive session and
later adjourned until to-morrow.
EUROPE MAY GIVE TROUBLE.
Complications Feared Over the Claims
Against San Domingo.
WASHINGTON, March 17.â 1n view
of the expected adjournment of the
present extra session of the Senate
without definite action on the Domini
can treaty, it is expected the State De
partment will proceed with the col
lection of customs at Puerto Plata and
Monte Cristi under the terms of the
arbitration award of last year.
It is feared that complications may
arise through the action of some of thÂ»Â»
F.uropean powers whose citizens are
heavy creditors of Santo Domingo.
These claims have been held
in abeyance because the Euro
pean governments interested de
sire to shape their policies rel
ative to Santo Domingo by those of
America, being desirous of avoiding
any friction that would cause ill feel
ing in this country and apprehension
that the integrity of the Monroe doc
trine was an object of attack.
The question is whether, in view of
the failure of the Senate fto act favor
ably on the treaty which would have
provided the means for the payment of
these claims tho European govern
ments will longer refrain from inde
pendent action to collect their dehts.
and although it is fully realized here
that such action ;f attended by cer-
I clve measures will probably cause an

COMMITTEE REPORTS ON
MILK COMPANY'S CASE
New Co-op* rathe Company and Milk
Wagon Drivers* I'nion Agree
to .\bide by Arbitration.
The controversy between the Milk
Wagon Drivers' Union and the Milk
Co-operative Company was again up I
for discussion before the Labor Coun
cil last night.- The report of the ex- i
ecutive committee; to which body the I
matter had been referred on an ap
plication of the union for a boycott
was made and . both sides received it
satisfactorily. The report is .as fol
lows: : ' :â >:â  ;."
It Is the sense of this committee that the
causes of the controversy between the Wprk-
Ingmeri's" Co-operative Commercial Company
ar.d the Milk Wagon Drivers' Union is thÂ« re
duction of the price of milk to the consumers
by the.;Workingraen"s Co-operative Commercial
Company. *
It Is the I sense of this committee that thÂ»
Milk Wagon * Drivers' Union has not treated
the Worktngmen > Co-operative. Commercial
Company in a fair and impartial manner, the
same as It has treated other employers. In
â  that Â¥ the : Workingmen's ' Co-operative Commer
cial Company, applied for drivers, to, the nm<>n
and agreed to pay the scale of wages demanded
by the union, the union furnishing such men.

It 'Is the sense of this -committee,' In ' view
of the prior action of the Labor Council, that
the council does net concur In thÂ» action of
any" union or 1 unions I which tends to regulate
the price of marketable products or purchasable <
service, controlled- by the employers. In view i
of these facts the 'committee recommends that
â the application for boycott be dented and we
further recommend that j thÂ« parties â¢in â¢ Interest
submit the i question at issue to the executive

XEW YORKERS KN.fOY UNIQUE
ENTERTAINMENT AT JOl 1.1.1XS
Bohemian Club Christmas Pantomime
Presented AVith Strong Cast at
Artist's Studio.
Am^dee Joullin gave a reception to
Wilson Marshal!. Morton W. Smith
and Frank Unger of the Lambs' Club,
New York, at his studio yesterday af
ternoon, which will be chronicled in
the diaries of the gentlemen present
from the Empire State as being one of
the most unique of their receptions
since they put foot on the soil of the
metropolis of the Golden State.
Joullin and his good fellow lieuten
ants were determined that the Lambs'
Club, so prolific of entertainment,
should have good report of t^ie versa
tility ol the clubmen of San Fran
cisco. Consequently the studio was
turned into a miniature playhouse,
scenery was painted and, behold! the
pantomime. "Who'll Buy My Laven
der?" presented for the first time last
Christmas at the Bohemian Club, was
elaborately produced.
Chester Bailey Fernald, the author,
and Theodore Vogt, the composer, su
perintended the presentation.
The cast was in the following order:
Columbine. Charles Leonard; harle
quin. Amedee Joullin; Scai>in, Russell
Cool: first clown, Richard Hotaling;
second clown. Chester Bailey Fernald;
pantaloon, William H. Smith; Senilia,
Jerry Landfleld; Multidor, Courtney
Ford; captain of the guard. Noble Ea
ton, and pallbearers, Porter Garnett.
Robert Berkeley, Theodore Poindex
ter and Emerson Warfield.
Jules Mersfelder appeared in a Chi
nese play, for the production of which
handsome Chinese costumes were
used, and Winfred Goff of the Sav
age English Opera Company contrib
uted a stirring vocal selection.

ANNUAL SALE, TEN MILLION BOXÂ£SNORTHWEST WIND BLOWS MANY SHIPS TO PORT
ionolulu Packets Eincomrater Some Terrific Storms
If thÂ« harbor of San Francisco were
anything but the expansive stretch of
sheltered water that it is there would
have been trouble yesterday in accom
modating the vessels that passed in
through the Golden Gate. There were
twenty-nine arrivals on Thursday and
yesterday more than a score more
came In from sea, enabled to make port
by the grace of the northwest wind
which had replaced the trouble-mak
ing southeaster.
There were some coasters among the
arrivals, but the majority of them
-were sailing vessels, many of them
square riggers, and most of them com
pelled to anchor in the stream until
allotted berths at wharves best suited
for the reception of their cargoes. Off
Meiggs v, hart' a large fleet anchored.
Others dropped their mudhooks In Mis
sion Bay. Had there been a hundred
vessels, however, instead of a few
score there would have been anchorage
space for all and at that the ferry sys
tems would not have been cramped for
room nor would the navies of a few
â friendly powers have experienced any
difficulty, had they so desired, in per
forming elaborate evolutions in the
fpace still unoccupied. San Francisco
may occasionally run shy of suitable
wharf space, but there is anchorage
room here for all the ships in Lloyd's
register.
The fair wind which carried the
windjammers to port enabled many at
them to sail viÂ» the harbor to their
anchorages. There was plenty of work, '
however, for everything in the shape
.of a towboat from sunrise to long after |
the darkness fell.
The barker.!. S. G. Wilder, twelve
and a half days from Honolulu, en
countered southwest, westerly and
northwest gales and there was hardly
a time during the passage thai the
decks were not filled to the rails. Hans
Nelson, a seaman, was swept ever- j
board by one of the many waves which
gamboled across the Wilder's deck.
High as the yardarm it flung him and
then carried him away more -than a
ship's length beyond the reach of his
horror-stricken shipmates. They hard- ;
ly realized that Nelson was overboard i
before another and bigger wave, com- j
Ing In the opposite direction, took the ;
sailor on its broad bosom and flopped I
him back on the vessel's deck, wet and
winded, but wide-awake enough to
grab a sheet-end and hang on until
the waters receded. One wave which
swept the deck fore and aft carried
.the whole crew along the deck for
about fifty feet. The Wilder brought
15.700 bags of sugar.
The bark Amy Turner, fifteen days
from Hilo with 23.516 bags of sugar,
was also roughly treated by wind and
wave. Five feet of her starboard bul- ,
warks were carried away by one extra
lusty wave.
The bark Fresno, sixteen days from
Gamble, encountered the big southeast
er March 13 and 14 and came through
the storm with a heavy list to star
Â«board.
The schooner Bender Brothers, when
forty miles west of Point Arena, lost
fifty cords of wood.
The British ship Kirkcudbrightshire,
122 days from Antwerp, had to give
battle to the southeaster off this port.
The worst weather of her long journey
was encountered off Cape Horn in the
shape of a full-grown hurricane. A
new main lower topsail was blown to
ribbons. To heave the vessel to a tar- :
'paulin was rigged In the mizzen rig- :
ging and for twelve hours the lee i
davit? were under water. When the
gale had blown itself out it was dis
covered that the cargo had shifted and ;
that the Kirkcudbrightshire was listed
heavily to starboard. The displaced j
freight was trimmed with great dim- i
culty.

THEIR VICTIMS
Louis Polini, an Aged Cook,
Knocked Unconscious and
Robbed of His Money
COWAKDLY DESPERADO
i
Morris Eosenthal Enticed
Into Vacant House, but His
Screams Frighten Thugs
Louis Polini, a cock 70 years of agÂ«
who lives at 619 Davis street, was
found by Policeman Ingham late
Thursday night lying on the sidewalk
near his lodging house with his face
badly battered and bruised and weak
from loss c-f blood. Both of his eyes
were blackened and he presented a
pitiful spectacle.
Polini told the officer that he was on
his way home when a man approached
him aryi demanded his money. Before
he coulS comply to the demand the rob
ber struck him on the face, knocking
him down. He was repeatedly kicked
un the face till he became almost un
conscious. He did not know just how
much money he had in his pockets but
it was all taken by the robber. Ing
ham rang for the patrol wagon and
had Polini sent to the Harbor Emer
gency Hospital.
Morris Hosenthal, a junk dealer at
913 Fi.-lsom street, was passing a va
cant house at 1908 Powell street about
ten o'clock** Thursday morning when
three men who were in the house asked
him to come inside as they had some
rags to sell. When Rosenthal entered
the men attacked him and 'threw him
down. One of them attempted to go
through his pocl.ets, but he struggled
and screamed so loudly for help that
the thieves became frightened and ran
out of the house. They were seen to
run along Chestnut street.
Policeman J. H. Gorham was notified
and he assisted Rosenthal to a grocery
at 1869 Powell street where he soon re
covered from the effects of the attack
and fright. Gorham was informed that
the three men had been seen loitering
in the neighborhood for some time prior
to the attack upon Rosenthal, but no
one knew them.
Mongolia Sails To-Day.
The Pacific Mail Company's liner Mong-olla,
Captain Porter will sail at 1 o'clock to-day
for the Orient. She will carry ISO cabin
l.aPÃengers ISO Chinese and fifty Japanese.
Owing to the short interval between the Mon
golia's departure and the sailing of the Oceanic
Steamship Company's liner Sierra the Mon
golia will take comparatively few passengers
to Honolulu. The Mongolia will be loaded to
her full capacity with freight, mostly for
Japan, and altogether about 14,000 tons.

THE SANTO DOMINGO TREATY.
AS it ha* been made a party question, it is evident now that
the Santo Domingo treaty' will lack the necessary two-thirds
c for its ratification by the Senate. It is not necessary
to Haim that the treaty was the sum and end of all wisdom on the
t in order to vindicate it as an attempt at the solution of a
nuectjon that is yearly becoming more acute.
The Monroe doctrine was devised to counter the attempt of the
Mliance to reinstate, in this hemisphere, the monarchical insti
â¢ Spain after they had been overthrown by successful revolu
liop. That doctrine was the announcement to the world that the
1 'nited States would not permit any further extension of monarchy
in <>nr hemisphere. Senator Morgan of Alabama, in a speech favor
m '^f Hawaii, said that the Monroe doctrine meant
thai when a crown falls in our hemisphere it is never to rise again.
All that is well. The famous American doctrine has been the means J
of extirpating monarchy and Old World government institutions ,
the western hemisphere.
Had its result*; and its responsibilities stopped there, our hege
rbony of the hemisphere would not worry us at all. But, finding that
â¢eiÂ«m protects them in treating scornfulTy their international ob- 1
the Latin-American republics, so called, have gone on from j
net to the very debauchery of government. No inter- i
al obligation is held sacred by many of them, and some of
ihem have become entirely insensible to any honorable responsibility. |
As their soil and sovereignty cannot be touched by any power but
the Tnited States, they go from depth to depth of dishonor and dis
hotjn
While some of our political and military' prophets are turning ;
ihe country's attention to the Orient as the theater of future trouble
5, and are indulging in the expression of suspicions about the
ultimate designs of Japan, it remains true that the only source, of
'c that is really in sight is in our own hemisphere, and not in
m Asia. Americans have many reasons for knowing the pro
fligacy and dishonor of most of the Latin-American countries. They
have been ill-treated in their persons and despoiled in their proper-
I\ . and have had no recourse except by appeal to the protection of
ihcir <.wn Government. The difficulties of such appeal are great,
-c the power of the executive is limited, and all such appeals
may reach Congress. There it is found that the legislative branch
of the Government is in bondage to the sister-republics idea, and
the rights of Americans are subordinated to a misplaced international
cour;
Kven when such outrages on Americans are subjected to inter
national arbitration, it has been found possible for the losing Latin-
Atnfcrican country to get Congressional assurance of interference
with the arbitral verdict. Such a proceeding is scandalous, of course,
as do branch of our Government can properly interfere with such a
judgment. These things are among the domestic troubles caused by
otection afforded by the Monroe doctrine to those profligate
lies. They are, however, the smaller part of our troubles. These
molly in the same course of conduct toward European coun-
To extend commerce with Central and South America, in
<ms and commercial institutions are necessary. The insigni
ficance of our trade in that part of the hemisphere is due to the in
stability of such investments. Americans, rinding themselves un
protected and subject to the lawlessness of revolutionary govern
ments, are shy of settlement at many points where American trade
I be beneficial. Europeans, relying on the better protection
which it is assumed their governments can give, have made the in
ents. planted the commercial settlements and have captured the
trade. All this goes o,n while our sentimentalists preach the golden
rule, for which those governments care as little as they do for public
r, justice and civic stability.
Xow. Europeans are being plundered. Their franchises are
seized and their persons insulted. With the Monroe doctrine out of
the way these things could not be. The offending Government would

sS of territory or of revenues. This action we forbid. We pro
those countries against such chastisement and discipline. That
does not influence their good will or gratitude toward us
it. They rob and outrage Americans impartially and play no
es in their lawless game.
It seemed as though a solution had been found when Santo Do
mingo, after long nourishing her bandit and revolutionary govern
ation of foreigners, absented to our administration
blk revenues in order to repay her spoliations in all cases
iairly and well proved. The arrangement was of double advantage
to her. It would stop the stealing of her revenues by revolutionary
chieftains, would apply them to her honest debts, and would put an
end to revolutions by leaving no spoils in sight over which to cut
throats and break heads. The arrangement was made a natural and
â¢ for us. under the Monroe doctrine and our hegemony
hemisphere, but the Senate chooses to reject it by making its
ratification a party question. It is now incumbent upon the oppo
the treaty and the President, to tell the country their plan
aling with the problem.
S iator Morgan professes to have discovered that the treaty
be inimical to some concessionaires from his State. This is
â on that merely sticks in the bark of the question and does
nch the principle. What are our obligations to the worldunder
lonroe doctrine? Are we to make it the sanctuary of fraud and
robbery, of revolution and disorder? If so. let us say so. and take
the moral consequences which follow. If we refuse to permit the
protection of the persons and property of the nationals of other coun
tries in Central and South America, let us say so and be done with
our construction of the Monroe doctrine is in favor of the

dent has done his duty. He has proposed a solution which
~>nate rejects. What is the Senate's solution? Will it approve
ro and vindicate the late government of Simon' Sam in Haiti, as
model* of free institutions and proper administration?
Among the assailants of the President are many who have been
the most importunate in demanding that this administration protect
the rigrht* of Americans in Santo Domjngo and other Latin- American
tries. They may be left to their own admiration. They will not

THE COLORADO CASE.
THE governorship of Colorado has been settled by seating Gov-
Peabody a? the legally elected executive. It is said that
tfetf wa* accomplished by his promise to resign and leave the
be lieutenant Governor. This was made necessary by the
reappearance of the old factional fight in the Republican party of that
State h" this it so. the factionists will get their sole reward out of
it-satisfaction they may feel.
The revelations of fraud at the election were startling. There
--eems to have been scarcely a ballot-box in the State that was free
from corrupt tickets. In the evidence taken occurs this case, only
<>ne of many : Two women. Harriet Jardine and Fanny Burliner, pre
; themselves at the polls. They were challenged and said that
lived at 22ofc Market street. Denver. Judge Kellogg said he
knew of his own knowledge that that number had been a long time
vacant : he had examined it himself and called the attention of the
other election judges to the fact. They paid no heed but took the
vote* of the women. Then a name was found on the registry that
he name of a dog belonging to one of these women, and a ballot
put in the box for the dog. At the same poll the vote of a
parrot was taken and counted. A poll parrot, indeed ! All this was
Itoby W. S. Raymond, a reputable citizen. It is believed that
if the investigation had gone far enough it would have been found
that iackrabbits were voted against Peabody.

DISEASE-PROOF
MAN OF FUTURE
It has already been suggested that
the appendix should be removed from
every infant as a routine measure. But
this is clearly Insufficient, says the
British Medical Journal. The surgery
of the future must include far more
than this. The tonsils and turbinate
bones of the nose must be cut out,
because they may harbor germs. What
Mr. Arbuthnot Lane calls the "human
cesspool" (that is, the large intes
tine), must be removed along with a
considerable part of the upper portion
of the alimentary canal, because it
won't be needed when he begins to
live on M. Berthelot's tabloids and
pills. The too readily decaying teeth
will be pulled out in early life and
the germ-proof store variety Inserted.
The failing human eye will be antici
pated by spectacles in early youth.
Deficient moral sense and degeneracy
will be treated by ventilation of the
brain and removal of the offending
areas.
Thus protected against the perils of
civilization the man of the coming cen
turies will be able inÂ« his journey
through life to defy the countless ene
mies that seek to rob him of health â
sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans
everything.
ASSASSINATION
IN CZAR'S LAND
Takings-off are so managed in Rus
sia that the very chief of the Third
section has again and again proved un
able to protect himself, says the Pall
Mall Gazette. Colonel Sudeikin, who
held office in the late Czar's time,
transacted a good deal of his business
on an upper floor, in an out-of-the
way street, under a name as common
as the English "Smith," and always
with the door locked. A visitor had
to knock in a certain manner and give
a password that was changed every
day. Yet one day some one knocked,
gave the password, got inside and
opened fire. The colonel was badly
hurt, but he killed his man and reached
the landing â only to be finished off
with an iron bar there by somebody
else. Nowhere does the unexpected
happen oftener than in St. Petersburg.

one amendment, there may also be of
fered an amendment to an amendment.
In such Â«, case the first is called the
primary and the latter the secondary
amendment. The secondary amend
ment is first decidedâ because the pri
mary amendment, before being voted
upon, is to be perfectedâ and the vote
is taken upon the amendment as
amended. Thus there are three motions
to put to vote: First, the vote on the
secondary amendment; second, the vote
on the primary amendment; and third,
the vote on the perfected main ques

INDIAN SHOTâ Sub., City. The
plant commonly known as "Indian
Shot" derives its name from the seed,
hard, round, and about the size of a i
very small pea, and sometimes used by

yields a beautiful red flower. The root
is large, spongy and jointed, and is
used in Brazil as an emollient Doultice
for absecesses and tumors.

When Houghton entered he gava
the occupant of the bed a quick, direct

BAD OUTLOOK FOR OIL.
The prospects of the southern oil pro
ducers are reported to be gloomy. The
L,os Angeles Times says that with 75
per cent of the fields signed over to
the association there is but little pros
pect of getting a market. Discouraging
answers have been returned by the
Associated and Union companies, the
Isrjjest marketers In the field. In part
the T<mes -ays:
The market is limited by the ability to trans
port oil. If it â â â ie limited only by the de
mand for fuel all over the Rocky Mountain
region there would probably be another tale
to tell. TiirouKh I'tah, Colorado Montana and
ihf greet mining regions the use of oil would
be as rradily adopted as it has been in Ari
zona and on the coast; but when railroad
mtes thut off business and force up prices

The Food Plays Many Pranks.
Rev. William Alexander Smith,
prominent as the author of many
â¢works on Oriental Travel, has written
an entertaining: account of his expe-
rience in Kansas during the floods in
1803. He sal's:
"We lived a full mile from the near-
est point of the Saline River, but when
the river overflowed it sent a floo-i
clear into our dooryard and we had to
go about in boats, many of our neigh-
bors Buffering Bad experiences both
from loss of life and property. '
"WÂ« â wife and myself â had an
experience quite unique, and thereby
hanjss a tale. My -wife for years past
and myself as well had been annoyed,
pained and worried bo greatly at times
by flj-speptlc trouble as to take much
of the joy of living out of life.
"I had seen Postum bo liberally
spoken of and we suffered so much
from coffee that one day. som> months
Rgf, I decided to try some Postum for
ourselves. We liked its aroma and
taste, so we were satisfied from : the
start and we quit coffee.
"Gradually my digestive organs have
grown healthier and stronger, my sick
headache left and we both could eat
aJTiost what we pleased without dis-
comfort.
"But was this a result of the discon-
tinuance of tea and coffee?
"The flood came and found us out
of â  "-turn and shut off from all sup-
pii.-s in the village for 8 days. Rut we
got hold of some left over tea and a
Hi tie coffee and this we us*d as l"ng
rs it lasted. This was the only respect
in v hieh our meal* were .different from
wha:,ne had been using, r-ut a change
came over us. My wife thought I
had more temper than grace, while I,
In mr turn, thoughtâ t*wr
mind, only she did not seem to appear
to be the Jolly creature she was be-
fore flood days. She said she did not
rest well and that made her irritable,
and on my part I suffered pains in my
rfigestSve organs night and day that
woula have caused the moskest man
'to speak unadvisedly with his lip's.*
"Well, the clouds cleared away, the
ford riKued. dry land Appeared - and
we made ready to visit the grocery
Ftore, and my wife suggested that we
needed more Postum. To tell the
rest in a few words, when Postum
came back the domestic atmosphere
became more genial: in fact, about
normal. Our troubles and sick feel-
ing disappeared and 'there can: be ": no
doubt they were. due to tea and cof-
fee, for they quickly, yielded when
Postum was used in their: place." "
â¢ acair.st th*Â» Mountain Copper Company !
j is the suspension of all ore shipments ;
Ito Keswk-k for treatment. Several '
mines In Shasta County received;
prompt notice^that no more ore would â 
be received.
BITTi: LOOKS FOR COPPER.
Properties have been bonded by vari
ous parties about. Spenceville, Butte
County, preliminary to determining
whether copper in paying quantities is
In that district The Marysville Appeal
says that the bonders are private in
dividuals and aim corporations, but
i denies that John Martin is interested.

| As regards the assertion that certain proper
i tl*>s. whinh are &uppos?d to contain rich cop-
I per deposits, have 'â¢ â¢ 'i bonded by .Martin it
.an 'â  raid with authority that although some
of these proptrtie-s have been bonded, they have
not been by Martin, but by private individuals
I and corporations not connected with him. It
, baa not jet been determined whether or not
: there- is copper in that section in paying quan
tities and this will not be definitely known
until hundred* of thousands of dollars have
h en spent In prospecting.. These private in
dividuals and comoaintea which have bonded i
these prospective copper properties intend to
determine whether the copper is really there.
At the present time these are mere prospects,
but it is to be hoped that they will develop
into rich holdings.
, The Oroville Mercury says that all
mining claims and locations in Butte
County will be assessed for taxation
as personal property. This is in pur
suance of an order that was made last
July by the Butte ' County Board of
Supervisors. Says the Mercury:
The attention of the board was called to a
decision ox the Supreme Court on the collec
tion of taxes on an oil location In Kern
County. On this location there was valuable
machinery by th? sale of which the tax could
be collected. On the majority of mining loca
tions there are no improvements, and -as the
land is Mil! owned by the United States it
cannot be sold for taxes. â  Therefore It Is very
doubtiul if the taxes on 20 per cent of the
mining locations can be collected unless the
party t<Â» whom the location is assessed is will
ing- to pay it. The assessed valuation to be
placed on each location of 20 acres Is $50; on
100 acres, $400.
STARTING NEW SMEI/TER.
It is reported by the Redding Free
Press that the new smelter of the Great
Western Gold Company at Ingot will
be blown in not later than March 25.
The Free Press says: rj
The blowing in of the Afterthought smelter
will be a great event and will be accompanied
by much ceremony. All of the directors will
be here from St. Louis to attend the blowing
in. President Henderson, Vice President O.
E Adams and the other officers, and directors
left St. Louis en Friday en route to Redding.
They are coming so as to be in time to see
the smelter start up. The stacks at the smelter
are up. The big stack is 600 feet in length
and has a height of 130 feet vertical. The
sample mill is in operation and ore Is being
sent from mine to smelter over the crookedest
but beat constructed piece of road in the
, country. It was Intended to blow in on the
13th of March, but it la thought best now to
wait ten days longer in order that the masonry
work may dry thoroughly. .â¢ .
The consolidation of the Calumet and
Arizona, Calumet and Pittsburgh Lake .
Superior and Pittsburgh and Pittsburg;
and Buluth Mining Companies under I
one management is reported at Bisbee, ;
Ariz. The only mine in the consolida- j
tion that is actually producing copper !
at this time is the Calumet and Ari- j
zona. The ore reserves in the mines '
owned by the other companies are said i
to be large. â 
Nevada is full of mining surprises. j
In the middle seventies there were !
twice as many people in Virginia City, j
during the boom days of the Corn- i
stock, as the entire State of Nevada I
contained in 1900. .'â This spring in Es-.i
meralda County, at Tonopah. Goldfleld, â 
Bullfrog â  and other camps there will
probably be as many men as in all the
remainder of Nevada, and all an ew I
population. Nevada has produced
nearly as much in gold and silver as
California, but little of .it went to- ;
ward the development of the State. :
California and San Francisco have
been benefited largely. Nevada men
have cut wide swaths in Paris, London
and New York, whose names are well
known, the list including John Mackay, I
Jim Keene, John P. Jones, McCreary, :
Haggin and D. O. Mills.
The new discoveries in Esmeralda
County are being exploited by people ;
from all parts of the United % States I
except California. Alaskan Klondik- j
ers and men from Colorado are doing
the work. They all come to San Fran-;
cisco and will ultimately swell the
mining colony of this city. Some ten |
days ago a discovery of telluride was !
made at Bullfrog by "Lije" Harris, and
as a consequence a rush into the dis- j
trict by Colorado miners is reported.
The discovery is said to be of impor- i
tance because the ore body is large j
and gives reason for belief that other
large bodies will be uncovered in the
same region. Transportation is expen
sive and in order to get profits high
! grade ores that will stand the cost of
shipment must be found. If Harris'
discovery is followed up by others local
smelters will undoubtedly be put up.

WORKS BOARD
CLAIMS POWER
The Supervisors' joint Public Utili
ties and Finance Committee yester
day considered a proposed ordinance
submitted by the San Francisco Chap
ter of American Institute of Archi
tects providing for the manner of
competitive bidding for plans for the
municipal buildings to be erected un
der the bond issue and the selection
of a jury of award.
Signs of discord whjch will probably
delay indefinitely the erection of the
structures became manifest when
Commissioner of Works Eagan filed
a formal protest against the proposed
action of the Supervisors to invite the
submission of competitive plans. Ea
gan asserted that the Supervisors were
going over the heads of the Board of
Public Works Commissioners. He
called attention to the general provi
sion of the charter giving the Board
of Works full po\\;er in the matter of
preparing plans for public buildings.
Eagan said his board was willing at
any time to consult with the archi
tects, but would claim its rights in the
matter of supervision.
Chairman Braunhart referred to
another section of the charter which
empowered the Board of Supervisors
to pass an ordinance designating the
manner in which the plans shall be
prepared.
It was conceded that the Board, of
Works would have supervision of the
construction of all the public build
ings except the library building. Com
missioner Aigeltinger said his board
was In favor of competitive plans, but
asked that the proceedings in that
regard be followed in strict compli
ance with the charter. Brandenstein
suggested that the ordinance be con
sidered and after it had been revised
it would be submitted to the City At
torney for an opinion as to its va
lidity.
President Roncovleri objected to
secret competition, but Architect
Schulze said the Federal Government
favored that method.
JURY OF AWARD.
The ordinance provides that the
jury of award shall be composed of
two Supervisors, two architects to be
selected by the San Francisco Chap
ter, t\so persons to be selected by the
department under whose jurisdiction
the building shall be when completed,
the seventh member to be selected by
the foregoing.
The section wu objected to by the
committee, which thought that the
jury should be a voluntary body and
consist of five members to be selected
by the Supervisors, two of whom
shall be architects, one an artist and
the remaining two members of the
city department affected.
The ordinance provides that thft
architect whose plan shall be finally
accepted shall receive in compensa
tion for full professional services, in
cluding supervision of the improve
ments, a fee of 6 per cent upon the
total cost of the improvements. The
committee did not agree on this point
and will fix a schedule of fees here
after.
At this point Eagan again protested
against the proceedings, claiming
that the power of the Supervisors lies
solely in directing the Board of Works
to prepare the plans and not to spe
cify the method of securing them. The
committee agreed that the Supervis
ors had the right to take all proper
safeguards arounfl the expenditure of
the funds realized from the bond is
sue, but postponed final action on the
ordinance for a week.
TO BUILD CROCKER SCHOOL.
The committee recommended that
$17,000 be set aside for the erection
of the addition to the Crocker School
and will hold a special meeting next
Wednesday to consider the erection
of the Washington Grammar and
other schools, for which plans have
already been prepared.
City Attorney Long advised the
committee of offers from various
property owners to Bell land to the
city for the proposed Golden Gate

In (Tease the Payroll
MAESTRETTI EXPLAINS
Says Engineers Will Not
x Work for Less Than the
$308 Per Month Allowed
A resolution was quietly put through |
at Thursday's meeting of the Board of
Public Works which provided for an
increase in salaries of several subor
dinates in its employ. The fortunate
ones include Assistant Engineer B. J.
Morse?", whose salary was raised from
$275 to $300<fcer month; W. C. Pidge, F.
C. Heimann and "W. D. Connick, assist
ants hi engineer's office, from $175 to
$200: Miss A. P. Code, stenographer,
from $75 to $100 per month and B. Tyr- ,
rell, messenger, from $75 to $90.
There appears to be a mystery about I
the resolution, as no one in the office
knew of its whereabouts. The salaries,
according to Commissioner Maestretti,
were raised on the grounds of "efficiency
and additional work on tfye part of the

TAKE A REST
Rainy Weather Compels the
Hacket Wielders to Wait
for the Courts to Try
MANY GAMES SCHEDULED
Intercollegiate Meet Be
tween Stanford' and Cali
fornia Arouses Interest
â 
The unfavorable weather of the past
week necessitated a lay-off on the part
cf the tennis players. Many of them
were in need of a rest and will do much
better when play is 'resumed. Numer
ous events are 14 ' -luled and the
cracks will be Kept l>u.-y for some time.
The indoor tournaments must be
completed down to the semi-finals be
fore the end of the month. Only one
match has been played in the doubles
and many remain to be played in the
singles. When the weather clears both
of these events will be run off as rapid T
ly as possible.
The Ladies' Annex had a tourna
ment for the Olds cups scheduled for
last Saturday, but "wet weather caused
h postponement. It will be a handicap
doubles event and if the weather per
mits will, be played to-day. Miss Lulu
Wegener* and Mrs. C. Watson, the
club's strongest team, hold the tro
phies which must be won three times.
The Juveniles will also meet in a
tournament en the public courts to-day.
The competition will be a handicap
doubles event for the three-time Man
ager's cups. The holder? are Getz and
Levinson.
To-morrow the singles tournament
winch was commenced several weeks
ago will be completed. The only re
maining match is the unfinished one
between George Baker and Harold Ga
briel. The former has two sets to his
credit and is looked upon as almost a
sure winÂ»*-r. He will be in better
shape than he was two weeks ago
when he pulled cut .fa bad hole. Ga
briel has a good handicap and may
make it interesting Tor his opponent
despite the latter"? big lead.
The annual Intercollegiate meet
which comes up next month will prob
ably be played as heretofore on the
California Club courts. The matches
will prove more interesting than they
have for several years. California has
won so easily that the outcome as a
rule has not been in doubt. MacGavin
will not represent the blue and gold
this year and the chances of the col
leges are about even.
Stanford has already picked its rep
resentative?, while California will do
so before the end of the month. The
players representing the cardinal will
be George Hodge and A. R. M< Swain
in singles and Hodge and John Cassell
in doubles. Hodge is a clever player
and his college mates relied upon him
for at least one point. He met with an
accident during the week which, if It
does rot prevent his participating, will
at least cause a lay-off of a couple of
weeks. Hodge is a player who needs
long and constant practice to get Into
form. He has an excellent style, but j
is rather wild. A couple of weeks'
practice would put him in good shape
a::d he unquestionably would have a
g<xid chance to beat any man at Berke
ley.
California will be without champion
MacGavin, but the players from across*
the bay will make it interesting for* the I
Stanford n.en. Will Baker, who play- j
ed 1. -i year, wiji get one of the singles j
places probably. The other place will
f<> to either Herbert Schmidt. Claude
Wayne, Harry Rolfe or R. H. Variel.
In doubles Schmidt and Rc-Ife and Va
ri. 1 and Wayne will fight it out. They
are evenly matched and either one
would probably be a trifle stronger
than the cardinal team. On the whole,
the chances cf California again look a
little better thar those of Stanford.
The annual interclass doubles
tournament for the championship of
the University of California has been
ec-mpleted. Xeil Baker and Harry
Rolfe of the junior class easily carried
off the honors.
The Golden Gate Tennis Club has
sent out notices for a handicap doubles
tournament to be played April 2. The
cups for the event have been up for
two years. The c-nly team now in ex
istence that has won them more than
oice is th<; Baker Brothers. Homer
and Darius Hotchkiss.also won them;
twice, but they no longer play together.

Columbia Oarsmen, Having Been Cut
Off From tin ( rrek. Talk of
Joining Uie Canoeists.
For several years past the Colum
: lowing Club has taken no part
in the regattas on the bay. Now its
boathouso on Sessions Basin, East
and, h.TF been entirely blocked off
from the water by the building of a
wharf by an Oakland manufacturing
< ompany, it has been suggested that
the club join the Oakland Canoe Club
the clubhouse of which stands at the
head of Sessions Basin.
The rowing men would be taken
into the canoe club without payment
of any initiation fee, paying the reg
ular duos only. The old clujahouse
would be sold and the Columbia men
would simply move over to the canoe
club, a hundred yards away. Th<Â»
plan is an excellent one and is likely
to be adopted. The Canoe C l<ib has
a small number of members and can
well accommodate from fifteen to
twenty more. Pome of the members
of the Columbia Rowing Ctttb â¢ ere in
former day* enrolled j n the cÂ£noo
club.
The Olympic Boat Club has ele.-tert
the following officers for the coming
Keason: John Waiter, president; Wal
ter Bates, vice president; Elliott Stew
art, ifrcretary and treasurer; A Bul
lion, captain; E. F. RusÂ«s, lieutenant
;n. The directors are the fore
going officers, with Max Rosenfeld
representing the Olympic Athletic
Club, and Fred Hunt. The next cross
country run of the Olympic Club will
be held in April, the runners starting
from Â«nd finishing at the boathouse
Tiburon. The boathouse will be
tred and put in order before the
run is held. The members will be
â Ctlve in rowing and canoeing during
â¢he coming season.
Stanford Athletes to Go Sooth.

ranged for the field meet with Pomona

April ]. Fifteen Cardinal athletes will
make the southern trip. This meet
will be the first of the year with an

RAIN AFFORDS REST
FOR TRACK ATHLETES
No Danger of Overtraining
Blue and Gold Men Are Hopeful
BBRKSLET, March 17. â Wet
weather at inurvalp during the last
fortnight has propped temporarily act
ive work by the university athletes,
who for months have been steadily
training for th- three bit; intercollegi
ate contests that annually take place
in the spring â the baseball game with
Stanford, the boatrace and the track
and field day contest. The ball field
on the campus has not been in condi
tion for fast work, and the track has 1
needed sunshine to put It in good 1
shape. With the coming of warm,
clear days, however, the work of put
ting the finishing touches on the var
sity athletes will be begun, as, it is
getting close to that crucial springtime
day when blue and gold competes with
cardinal for supremacy in the trinity
of athletic sports.
Overruling Manager Ezra Decoto's
strenuous objections to a boatrace at
Stockton, the directors of the Univer- 1
sity of California Boat Club decided |
this morning to meet the Cardinal j
crew on the inland course next month, j
provided the executive committee of
the Associated Students ratify the ac
tion.
The boat club directors mÂ«t at 11 i
o'clock to receive the reports of Coach i
Garnett and Manager Decoto, who
have been in consultation with Stan- i
ford men regarding the vexed ques- |
tion of a course for the intercollegiate j
match. The two men reported that I
Stanford is firm in her refusal to meet j
California on the Oakland estuary, the j
men of the rival university evidently
believing their chances will be mini- j
mized by meeting California on a
course which is familiar to the Berke
ley men, but not to Stanford's crew.
The Stanford men insisted that Stock- 1
ton would provide both course and ac
commodations for spectators, insuring
satisfactory financial returns.
Manager Decoto was vehement in his '
objections to this proposal from Stan- ,
ford. He could not see where the I
money was to come from at Stockton j
to properly reimburse the business {
management ol the boating match.
The California Boat Club directors,
however, agreed that Stanford's point
should be conceded and a match ar
ranged at Stockton, on condition that
the proposed Stanford-Washington race
at Stockton scheduled for April 20 be
postponed, and the match with the
northerners put off to a time later than j
April 29, when California agrees to
meet Stanford at Stockton.
This decision of the directors will be
considered by the executive committee
of the Associated Students next Tues- |
day night. If ratified by that body it i
will be sent to Stanford for approval. '
The fine showing of the sprinters, i
shot-putters, hurdlers, jumpers, pole- i
vaulters and hammer throwers at the '
interclass field day last week has en
couraged Trainer Christie to prophesy
victory for California when the inter

collegiate field day is held. He believes
if the T>resÂ°nt good work is kept up
and traininK is faithfully done the stars
of the California contingent will pull
out a victory for the State University.
Ollie showed his injuries
sustained in football last term have
not affected his sprinting powers,
demonstrating that he can still do 100
yards in 10 1-fi seconds with ease.
California is believed to hold Stan
ford safely in the shot-put event, too,
as Gilmore's record of 43 feet 17Vi>
inches, phenomenal indeed at this time
of the year, is expected to surpass any
thing the Stantord men can show in
that event.
The university has lost a promising
baseball pitcher in the expulsion of
Freuler, who was a candidate for the
varsity baseball team and had excel
lent prospects of making the nine.
Newman and Heitmuller, however, are
expected to hold Stanford down, the
veteran, Heitmuller. having shown
that his arm has lost none of its cun
ning and that his batting eye still is
like that of the eagle.
Coach Nick Williams has been suc
ceeded by Coach McCarthy, the former
having been called to Seattle to begin
his season with the professionals. Wil
liams had the team well in hand when
he left, and predicted that some star
performances would be given by the
team before the season ended, despite
the loss of a few preliminary games
early this season.
CARDINAL. ATHLETES QUIET.
Death of Mrs. Stanford Has Spread
Gloom Over Her Boys.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
I"â Athletics at Stanford have been
quiet because of the death of Mrs.
Stanford. Only sufficient practice to
keep the athletes in shape has been in
dulged in. All campus baseball games
and track meets have been canceled,
and it is unlikely the university w:ll
be the scene of athletic contests of
any sort until the field day with the
University of California late in April.
The baseball squad has been taken
off the campus for praotice games and
the work of the men in the lineups
seems to please Coach Cowden. Hit
ting, of course, is still the weakest
point of the cardinal team, but the
unremittent batting practice of the
past two weeks has improved the hit
ting eyes of the young sluggers. In
the game with Santa Clara on Thurs
day they showed what they could do,
when in the ninth inning, with the
score one all, the Stanford players
found the ball for enough safeties to
bring in three runs. The team will
depend greatly on Sales to win the
intercollegiate scries. On present form
this undergraduate pitcher promises to
be the best player that has occupied the
box for the cardinal In many years.
Preparations for boating are going on
YACHTING MEN MAKE
CRAFT READY.
Â»
Sausalito Sailors Arrange Cruises
and a Power-Boat Regatta,
This year, as last, the Belvedere
bridge will be raised on the first Sun
daj^ in April to let the yachts out of
the lagoon into the cove. So many of
the yacht owners selected other places
as winter quarters at the close of the
last yachting season that hardly half
a dozen boats are in the lagoon. The
sloops Amigo, Neptune, Sans Souci and
Cupid are in the lagoon.
The sloori Sans Souci has been sold
and the slooi> Amigo chartered; both
will be moored off Sausalito during the
coming season. The sloop Belle has
been sold and will be kept near the
quarters of the Ariel and South End
rowing clubs. The sloop Merope has
also changed hands and F. C. Ray
mond has parted with the sloop Comet,
formerly the Will o1o 1 the Wisp, as he
is having a new yacht built for him by
a North Beach builder.
Several craft of the San Francisco
and Corinthian fleets have been moored
during the winter in Corte Madera
Creek. To-morrow Commodore Jen
nings will tow the sloops Speedwell
and Meteor down to Tiburon Cove
with his launch Vino. During the week
the sister boats, Edna and Emma, will
be towed to their summer moorings
off the Corinthian Yacht Club house.
The commodore has sold his launch,
but will not give delivery of her until
April 1.
In arranging their programme of
cruises for the coming season the Co
rinthians were reluctantly obliged to
omit the trip to the South Bay Yacht
Club from the list. The cruise was
as smoothly at Stanford as though
there had never been any dispute over
the proposed course along he Oakland
estuary. The boath6use on the slough
at Redwood City has been completed
and the new racing shell from New
York will be launched there to-morrow.
This slough is full of smooth water,
with a straightaway course of more
than two miles, affording the Stanford
men a much better opportunity to
practice than did little Laerunita
Lake, just above the university. It
is, of course, far too >early In the sea
son to form any idea of what the
strength of the cardinal crew will be.
but the men are showing superior form
to that displayed last year at the time
of the intercollegiate race.

London has the largest proportion of

is a close second, with 342 to the 100,000

intended to repeat it this year, but
the only holidays that give enough
time are the Independence and Labor
clay vacations, and on the latter of
these the tides-, which are an exceed

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES
TO MEET ON CIXDER PATH
Keen Competition Expected To-Day at
Berkeley Oral in Semi-Annual
Field Day.
All preparations for the semi
annual field day of the San Francisco
Athletic League have been completed
and judging by the number of athletes
entered and the amount of training
done by the representatives of the
various high schools the struggles on
Berkeley oval this afternoon should
be memorable ones.
The Lick boys are generally con
ceded first place, as they have a bet
ter team than they had last Autumn,
when they won the championship of
the State. The race for second place
is where the greatest competition will
be found, as Lowell, Polytechnic,
Wllmerding and Mission all claim to
have at least the second best delega
tion.
The events which will bring out the
keenest competition will be the two
short dashes, in which Miller, C. S.
M. A., and Siegle of Mission School
will figure; the mile run, in which
Promising Puppies
for Futurity of
Next Year.
San Joaquin Again
Supplies Hares
for Coursing.
Although the scarcity of hares has
had a bad effect on coursing the fol
lowers of the sport of the leash have
gone on steadily raising the standard
of the breed of greyhounds oji this
coast. The best English strains have
been carefully crossed with the choicest
in America, and some high-class per
formers have been secured.
The enthusiasts are eagerly looking,
forward to the Futurity of 1906 for
a greyhound which should be able to
lower the colors of any dog in Eng
land. Palo Alto, Pocatelli and Ro
man Athlete, the best three sons of
the mighty Emm Pasha, will all be
represented in that event. They have
been mated with greyhounds which
have been famous either as producers
or which have won renown on the
field. Palo Alto and Pocatelli have rec
ords of victories which no other gTey
hound ever approached. As they come
by their speed and their cleverness na
turally it is expected they will trans
mit these qualities to their progeny.
The best puppy shown so far this
year is A. Buker's Judge Dean, a di
rect descendant of the old California
stock. He Is by Moondyne II out of
Wattles. The sire was by Moondyne-
Teresa Jr., she by Ben Ali-Tralee. Wat
tles is by Rochester- Wattlebloom. The
latter was imported from Australia by
R. E. de B. Lopez.
The puppy won the Belle Brandon
challenge cup on Washington's birth
day cleverly, showing speed, gameness
and determination in a marked degree.
Both the promoters of coursing and
the owners are all at sea owing to the
difficulty of securing hares. It was
thought Oregon would supply all that
were required, but when drives were
made for them they apparently took
fright and disappeared. The men have
returned to the San Joaquin, where
they are redoubling their efforts to se
cure a supply. The expense has in
creased until it costs more than $2 for
each hare coursed.
Two stakes will be decided to-mor
row at Union Coursing Park, sufficient
hares of good quality having been re
seived. The likely winners:
Class stake â Humboldt, Carlow Boy, The
Duke, Frank C, Hudson, Rector. Reckiees Ac
robat, Richard Anton.
Reserve stake â In Time. Confident, Aeolus.
Renegade Apache. ?ea Lion. Ruby Sankey,
Oold Chain, Sir Winton. Pomona. Homer Boy,
Sherman. Charter Member. Texas Mamie. Or
slna. Patched t'p. Kaby Aurora, Happy Lad.
Dear Gaston. Nellie M. Rocker Arm, Angus
Clssus, Tralee Maid, Yellowtail. Rush Away.
there are three good men, Maundrell
of Lowell. Alayes of Lick and Heiden
reich of Wilmerding, and the mile re
lay, in which all the schools will strive
their hardest. This brings more honor
to the winner than any other event.

teams are engaged, making three
matches and a bye. The Albion Rovers
teat the Eagles last Sunday at Free

The Independents beat the Santa
Cruz team easily last Sunday at Santa
Cruz, the score being 6 goals to 1. The
game was played in Vue de l'Eau Park
on a wet ground and with half a gale
blowing. The Santa Cruz team was
outmatched. It was unlucky that the

champions in the first round, as it de
prived them or a chance to survive to
the semi-final round.

About three years ago the trustees

drives, but a poor second shot put thÂ©
player who was down in a position
where a high board fence intervened
between him and the hole. His oppo
nent played and placed his ball nicely
on the green: then he walked forward
feeling pretty confident of winning the
hole, as his ball lay nearly dead, while
his opponent had to play from a diffi
cult ; position in which accurate ap
, proaching was almost impossible. Sud
denly he saw the other ball roll across
the green and come to rest within a
foot of the flag. His opponent had
really made a poor shot, but the 'ball,
instead of striking the fence and
bounding back, had passed neatly
through a knot hole and landed 30 near

The baseball fans will have a chance
to get a line on the reorganized San

UiiCle Hank Harris will send his col
lection against the Chicago National
L*r&Â«ruers. This game will be the first
. ol a series of four and will be called
at S o'clock at Recreation Park.
"Bull" Pcrrine will hold the indicator.
The Chicago lads were expected to
arrive in this city last night, but they
rl^yed an engagement with Mike
Fisher's Tigers yesterday at Fresno, so
consequently their arrival will be de
layed Ull this morning. President Hart
accompanies the team, as does Man

:iie doings of the boys while they are
:n other climes.
Chicago played here against the
Seals last season and beat them out
In a hot eleven-inning game. This
year the team is stronger if anything,
iiany of the old players are on the
lift and the line-up has been strength
ened, by the addition of a number of
yuung players, who have shown great
form in practice.
Chicago finished second to the
great New York Giants last season for
.the pennant and Manager Selee ex
j'tiu to bring home the flag this time.
He has a fine pitching staff, while
Kiing behind the bat is considered to
bÂ«. one of the strongest backstops In
the business to-day. Both the infield
and outfield are made up of remark
ably fast men.
The natives are all in fine form after
their long siege of hard work in the
south. They v.ere out for light prac-
Uct at Recreation Park yesterday
morning just to get their eyes trimmed
en the riHd and to secure the range
cf the bases once again. Captain Wil
son says the team looks good to him
and he figures on giving the big
leaguers â  beating this afternoon.
Xealons showing in practice stamps
him as â  boy who will do. He handles
the snappy throws of Mohler and
Gochnauer like a big leaguer and
clano^s around the sack just as thoug9l
he had played in fast company all his

TROUT CULTURE
TO BE SHOWN
Eiitiie Proem Can Be Seen
at Forthcoming Forest,
Fi>h and Game Exhibition
WOBK IS INTERESTING
Will shebley, Government
Expert, Will Conduct Some
Remarkable Experiments
1 The California State Fish Commis- )
j sion. through the agency of Chief Dep- j
; uty Charles T. Vogelsang and of Pro- 'â¢
j fessor Scale, is planning an exhibition I
jin conjunction with the Forest, Fish J
and Game show in Mechanics' Pavilion
\ which should prove an attractive ea- 'â 
: ture. The artificial hatching of thou
sands of trout will be conducted in !
j view of the spectators from the strip- }
â  ping of the female of spawn to the !
birth and early struggles of the finny j
tribe. The timing of the work has been j
j done in such a way as to have hun
; dreds of fish breaking through the eggs
! every day.
The process is most interesting and
I is being followed throughout the coun
j try in order to stock streams that were .
i fast becoming depleted. California has
; half a dozen such hatcheries, one of [
which is conducted by the federal gov- j
! eminent and one by a private rail- !
road enterprise. Millions of fish are j
j annually turned into the headwaters
of the Sacramento alone and the possi
bility of the extinction of certain spe
cies of edible fish is thus done away
with,
After the stripping of the fish, fertili- ,
zation of the eggs is accomplished and >
, nothing: remains but the tempering of :
; the water and the keeping of it in ac- i
tion. The hatching of fish is the di
rect opposite of the incubation of bird i
eggs. The fish breaks through the coy- \
ering with the tail and the eggs : must
be kept at a temperature close to 48.
| degrees. Two weeks from the fertili
zation of the eggs the fish are born. ;
Xature has provided a food sack that
provides sustenance for another two
weeks; then the little shiners are ready
and able to shift in the world for them- !
selves.
. What makes the system especially i
interesting is the fact that the eggs j
are almost transparent and the forma- j
tion of the fish may be readily seen I
during the entire period of hatching.
Steelhead and rainbow trout will be j
used in the process. Each of these '
I species produces about 4000 eggs. All
l but about five per cent are saved, while
in the natural waters, fully eighty-five
per cent of the eggs do not hatch.
This is where science improves - upon
nature.
Will Shebley, the government ichthy
ologist,^ has been successful In the
i crossing of species. His services have .
' been loaned for the exhibit and he will' :
conduct his experiments during the two
weeks. His wish Is to cross the beau- j
tiful golden trout with* the' rainbow. ;
It may be possible the first California !
sportsman's show will give a new fish
species to the world.

CHICAGOS DOWNED BY TIGKRS.
Big Leaguers Swine Vainly at Fire
man Fitzpa trick's Curves.
FRESNO, March 17. â In a splendid
exhibition of ; baseball the Tacoma
Tigers defeated the Chicago Nationals
this afternoon. By dint of consistent
ball playing, superb base running and
excellent twirling on the part of Fire
man Fitzpatrick the boys > from the
north won by a 6 to 3 score. The game
lasted only eight innings,- as Chicago
had to quit to catch a train to i San
Francisco.
Tacoma played as well as she did at
any time last season and Mike Fisher's
fcmile is broader than the smile 1 of ;a
farmer who prayed for rain. Fitzpat
rick kept his hits scattered 'â  and dis
played good Judgment. , , The Â£ big
leaguers could not hit his curves till
the last Inning. : . ;^

SALABLE CAPTURES HANDICAP
AT RACE TRACK ACROSS THE BAY
Five First Choices
Linger by the
Wayside
F. W. Barr Outfoots
Daruma and Other
Fast Ones.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
A person without a shamrock on hi 3
coat lapel or a bit of green mixed up
somewhere with his wearing apparel
felt ashamed of himself yesterday at
Oakland traclc Everybody from the
president of the association down
seemed bent on paying homage to Ire
land's patron saint. Even five of the
public choices ran green, which was
taken as no joke by the speculative
fraternity. The track, heavy and hold
ing, mada the guessing difficult, and
the large crowd met with only mod
erate success in a prolonged skirmish
with the layers.
The St. Patrick's Day handicap at
six furlongs, with a field of five lin
ing up, resulted in a famous upset.
Priticese Titania, the favorite, could
not untrack herself in the going, fin
ishing last. Salable, backed from 7 to
5, gradually outsprinted My Order,
and, ridden out, beat Dr. Rowell's en
try more than a length. Lloyd Foun
tain, who rode David Boland, got his
dates all mixed up at the start and
finished third on apparently the best
horse.
YELLOWSTONE BEATS OLYMPIAN
Johnny Schorr's Olympian, favorite
for the Dublin scramble which start
nd tho ball rolling, ran up against a
Tartar in Yellowstone. The spindle
stopped on the wrong color all right,
but nevertheless the 7 to 1 shot breast
ed the tape three lengths ahead of the
first choice. Fflervescence, the early
pacemaker, finished third. La Figaro,
a broadly circulated tip, created slight
disturbance.
â  W. Davis 1 now,. began his triumphal
advance by taking the .- Cork sprint
over six furlongs with Emma Reu
bold, whose price went to 5% to 1.
Albemarle \\ looked " best, but :-â¢ â  Lloyd
Fountain broke it up â '- painfully and
Emma scored easily. 1 War Times fin

PROFITABLE WINS HAVDILY.
Nine out of every ten lightning cal
culators thought they saw a soft spot
for Major Tenny in the Belfast dash
at a mile. After the rush had sub
sided the price about thp Major had
been slashed from 8 to 5 to 11 to 10.
He led for three-quarters of a mile
and then resigned from the service.
Davis here picked up the pace with
the second choice, Profitable, reaching
the wire an easy first. Show honors
went to Lady Kent.
In the Killarney selling affair at
pÂ»vpn furJongs Davis roip Baker, the
11 to 10 favorite. Through overcon
fidence at the close his mount was
collared and downed a nose by Bob
Ragon, with Lloyd Fountain up. The
winner's orlds went back in the bet
ting from 8 to 5 to 3 M>. finally closing
at 13 to 5. Third place went to Mil
ler's Daughter.
TRACK NOTES.
W. Davis piloted three winners and
was beaten but a nose on Baker. To
day marks the final appearance in the
saddle here of the crack lightweight,
as he leaves for New York to-morrow.
Bookmaker Joe Rose left the track
early yesterday, called to the bedside
of his brothor "Izzy," who is lying
dangerously ill in this city with pneu
monia.

THORNTON STAKES AT
FOUR MILES TO-DAY
The time honored Thornton stakes !
at four miles will attract the lovers I
of long distance racing to Oakland I
track this afternoon. The field is not
a large one and it looks as if Horatius
and Veterano would be .the two to |
fight it out at the finish. Horatius
captured the Waterhouse â¢ cup over
two and a quarter miles, but this is
his :â¢ first â¢ public essay at the longer
distance. Notwithstanding this fact,
the Skinner entry- will be a pro
nounced favorite [in the betting. . Vet

MUST ANSWER
LIBEL CHARGE
DENVER. March 17.â Charges of
criminal libel against George J. Kin
del, arising from the alleged publica
tion and circulation by the defendant
of a pamphlet in which the picture of
Henry B. Hyde, founder of the Equi
table Life Assurance Society, appeared
between the pictures of Jesse James
and "Soapy" Smith, under the title
"Kindel's famous gallery of dead char
acters," are embodied in three infor
mations filed in the criminal court here
to-day by District Attorney George
Stidger.
Klndel is alleged to have published
the offending circular February 20,
1905, and to have circulated it by
means of the mails and otherwise, with
the intention; the informations allege,
of insinuating that Henry B. Hyde
consorted with outlaws and confidence
men.
Charles W. Mills, inspector of agen
cies of the Equitable Society, who made
the affidavits on which the informa
tions are based, said that the prosecu
tion was instituted after all other
means had failed to induce the author
of the circular to discontinue tjhe pub
lication of alleged defamatory insinu
ations regarding one who is dead. The
object of the action. Mills stat<^J, was
solely to stop alleged attacks upon the
character of the deceased father of the
present head of the Equitable.
Kindel was actuated in issuing the
circular in which Hyde's picture is
seen between that of a famous outlaw
and that of a confidence man by the
failure to realize the amount he ex
pected on a fifteen-year policy in the
Equitable, according to Agency Inspec
tor Mills.
Berkeley l>efeats Santa Clara.
SAN JOSE. March 17. â The Uni

It was a hotly contested game in all
save the fifth inning, during which the
ttnta Clara team went to pieces, al
wing Berkeley to make four runs,
eitmuller. who pitched for California,
â ft-a? in splendid form and the college
boys could do little with his delivery.
Bliss caught an exceptionally strong
game for the blue and gold. Wolters

TRADE SHOWS
IMPROVEMENT
NEW YORK, March 17.â R. O. Dun
tt Co.'s weekly review of trade to-mor
row will say: Higher temperature is
still needed to bring out full spring ac
tivity at many points, but improvement
is discernible in almost all depart
ments. Mercantile payments are more
prompt. Railway earnings, which have
been falling behind in comparison with
last year, were 8.1 larger for the first
week of March, and there is compara
tively little complaint of freight con
gestion. Manufacturing plants, espe
cially in the iron and steel industry,
show great activity.
Floods have done some damage on
the Pacific Coast, but farming pros
pects there, as in most other sections,
are decidedly favorable. Large farm
reserves of corn and oats are not ac
companied by depressed prices, and the
small wheat stocks are neutralized by
most profitable quotations. â¢
Foreign commerce relations show un
precedented imports in February, and
for the last week at this port alone
there was an increase of $6,375,188 com
pared with the corresponding period of
1904, while experts rose $1.759,315. Hides
continue firm.
Failures this week numbered 250 in
the United States against 229 last year,
and 26 in Canada compared with 21 a
year ago.
Bradstreet'a to-morrow will say:
Spring trade and outdoor activities
gather force as the month advances.
Lumber and building materials show
most activity. All reports indicate great
activity in railway circles. Gross re
ceipts for January gained 6 per cent,
while net increased 12 per cent.
A feature of the spring outlook is the
confidence as shown in a very large
amount of building being done in near
ly all parts of the country -
" Pacific Coast lumber interests report
continued improvement. From the Pa
cific Coast other Improved reports
come, particularly from Los Angeles.
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending March 16. are 895.742
bushels, against 1.255.956 bushels last
week and 2,608.144 bushels this week
last year. From July 1 to date the
exports are 45,594.104 bushels, against
112.930.459 bushels last year.
Business failures in the United
States for the week ending March 16.
number 186 against 190 last week. 193
in the like week in 1901 194 in 1903 and
197 in 1902. In Canada failures f<>r the
week number 22 as against 40 last week
and 17 in this week a year ago.
Honey Mellodv Defeats McCarthy.
BUTTE, March 17. â HonÂ»y Mellody
of Boston, in the fifteenth round of
what was scheduled to be a twenty
round go to-night, knot ked out Jerry
McCarthy of Butte. Honors were even
until the knockout blow, which lame

HILL ANXIOUS
TO END CASE
WASHINGTON, March 17. â "Wil
liam P. dough, for the' Northern Se
curities Company, made application
to ; the 1 Supreme Court to-day for the
Issuance of the mandate in the case
of E. ;H. Harriman and other? against
the Northern Securities Company la
accordance with the decision of the
court in favor of the company. He
based it on the ground that until the
mandate should be issued J5, 000.000
worth of property would be tied up
by the injunction of the New Jersey
court and this was an injustice to the
public and the owners of the property.
; Maxwell Evarts, representing the
opposing side, objected to the motion,
saying that the mandate should not
be issued until the opinion of. the
court in the case is handed down. The
court took the matter under advise
ment after directing that the applica
tion of Clough be printed. Evarts. In
his objection to the mandate, , said:
The appellants In the above entitled cm*
respectfully ask. this honorable . court not to
direct the issue I of , the mandate on th* recent
decision herein until after the court has filed
it* opinion, and the grounds of its decision
have been disclosed and the appellants ha\Â«
had an opportunity to examine the same. The
immediate use of the mandate in the taae at
bar would render the 'exercise of thÂ« right to
petition for ; rehearing. ' etc.. futile and una
vailing, because it is the avowed Intention nt
the Northern Securities company forthwith to
distribute and dispose of â¢ the subject mat
ter of the. litigation. It Is earnestly submitted
that it Is â¢ unjust . to permit this â¢to bÂ« done
until ha grounds .of '. the decision have been
disclosed In the ' opinion . of â  the â¢ court and th*
appellant's counsel have been afforded the op
portunity : to advise ' their clients. v 'n the light

SAN RAFAEL, March 17â ThÂ« quiet
of ; San * Anselmo was disturbed this
morning by a large male deer. The.

PROMINENT FKATERNALJST
ON TOUR OF VISITATIONS
Frederick Gaston, the Head of the
Grand Fraternity, Is Tendered
a Reception.
Frederick Gaston, one of the best
known fraternalists of this country, ar
rived in this city last Thursday on a
tour of visitation to all the branches
oi the Grand Fraternity, a fraternal
organisation of which he has been the
head for the last twenty years. Cali
fornia is a part of the territory he
has included in his itinerary. He has
In the last three months visited all the
Southern States and will continue the
visits until he shall have been in every
State in the Union.
On the evening of his arrival here he
was honored by a reception in the ban
quet hall of the Odd Fellows' building,
whÂ«;re he was welcomed by nearly 500
persons, and, after the formality of
introduction, he addressed the meet
ing. Last evening the various subordi
nates of the Grand Fraternity in this
city had a cla3s initiation in the same
building to enable the head of the
order |o see how the members carry
out the ritualistic work.
To-night Mr. Gaston will be the
guest of honor at a dinner at the Cali
fornia Hotel, given by the members of
the local branches and those of the
branches in the cities bordering on the
bay. *
Mr. Gaston Is accompanied on his
travels by Mrs. Gaston, who is deeply
interested in fraternal work.
Changes of Captains.
Captain F. C. Boehmer Is now captain of
the steamer Ida W, in place of Captain H.
Johannessen; F. A. Johnson succeeds P. H.
Crlm in command of the L. Roscoe; W, A.
Stark is master of the steamer F. A. KUburn
in place of K. Merrlam. and E. Kallenb-rg
has succeeded J. Mattson as master of the
schooner Mabel Gale.
Makns Another Fast Passage.
Ihe Xorweg-ian ship Lancing, which arrived
on Thursday from Newcastle, England, made
the long trip in the remarkably short time of
115 days. The Lancing was once a steamer.
Sh. was built ln 18Wi at Glasgow. Since her
(.diversion to a sailing vessel she has made a
number of record passages* She is a four
master and square-rigged on every mast.
Water Front Notes.
One hundred and thirty-four bodies werÂ«
transferred yesterday from the army transport
Thomas to the Presidio.
The German ship Henrlette. out twenty-nlnÂ«
days from Port Lus Angeles for Portland, wu
placed on th e overdue list yesterday at 8 per
cent. Ihe other overdues are quoted as fol
lows: Freshfleld and Mars; 90 per cent;
Oberon. 8 per cent, and Francois, 5 per cent.
Martin Brown, who lives at 421 Francisco
street and Is employed in the customs service,
nearly choked yesterday on his false teeth. A
sneeze had detached the artificial grinders
rrom Brown's gums and the convulsion had
thrown the Ivories down his throat, where
they remained hard and fast until Dr. Paw
lick! at the Harbor Hospital pulled them bock.
John O'Keefe, the diver, jumped overboard
about 10 o'clock Thursday night from How
ard-street wharf and saved from drowning
John O'Leary, a marine fireman, who, while
intoxicated, had taken an involuntary dive
Into the tide.
W. Bannister, the colored cook on the army
transport Thomas, developed signs of insani*
yesterday and wa s turned over to the city
authf Hties. When the ambulance from the
Harbor Hospital arrived at the transport
wharf Bannister was In Captain Dunn's office,
swathed in life preservers and swimming care
fully in the atmosphere. When they told him
the ambulance was a lifeboat he went on
board without making any resistance.
Louis Goinez. two years old. who lives at
12 Bartol street, tried the experiment of .Irlnk
ing coal oil. Eh-. Pinkham at the Harbor
Hospital mixed him a chaser, which probably
will counteract any evil effects of the Rocke
feller cocktail.

STOCK RAISERS
ARE TOO SLOW
President Hagenbertk Says
Coast Men Should Supply
Meat for the Philippines
MEANS A BIG BEVENUE
Government Is Paying Mil
lions of Dollars Every
Year to Foreign Markets
F. J. Hagenberth, president of the
National Livestock Association, has
j been a guest at the Palace Hotel for
several days, awaiting a chance to go
to Los Angeles, where private business
affairs await his coming.
While discussing the livestock situa
tion in the West yesfcerday, Hagenberth
expressed surprise over the fact that
the coast stockmen were not showing
more interest in the consumption of
: meat in the Philippines, the supply for
j which the Government is getting from
South America and Australia. Upon
; this subject he said:
I cannot understand why your cattlemen
I and whole^tlers do not unite In an effort to
< get this tr&de for th^ coast Instead of letting
foreign markets derive the magnificent rev
enues the annual trade provides for them.
ÂOur Government, through Its army commis
sary department, is advertising for bids for
supplying 30,tKXJ head ol beeves and 200.000
sheep that will be opened on July 1. It Is al
most certain that these contracts will be
awarded to Australian ana South American
i firms, as before, instead of to cattlemen on
, this coast. When you consider that the
I beeves bring about *40 a head and sheep
1 about S3 lio it is easy to imagine what a loss
: it means to the Pacific Coast industry, amount
ing to several millions of dollars.
If the cattlemen and the big beef con
tractors on this coast would only unite there
I is no doubt that they could divert this trade
to themselves, where it rightfully belongs.
San Francisco, with its ample facilities, could
handl* the bulk of the supplies and Seattle
and Portland could also get a share of It.
From what I have observed your cattlemen
are too si- w.
COUNTESS IS OX VERGE
OF LOSING SUM OF $13 66
Petition Is Filed to Set Aside Decree
of Distribution in Jordan
Estate.
"Nora Aymeric, a nonentity, identi
cal in description with the Countess
d'Humieres." will lose $13 66 if the
court grants a petition filed yesterday
jby Thomas H. Palache, administrator
oÂ£ the estate of the late Louisa Mary
Jordan. The Countess d'Humieres
(nee Kelly), Christian name Norah,
who resides in Ireland, will also lose
$12 66 if the petition is granted. So, if
the ancestral castle in old Erin needs
repairs they will have to be made
with other than American gold.
Mr. Palache sets forth that a decree
cf distribution heretofore made in
which a few hundred dollars were or
dered distributed among- a score of the
common people and one Countess was
improperly ordered. He asks that the
decree be vacated and that all of the
funds of the estate be distributed to
William Frederick Courtney Jordan,
as assignee of W. R. H. Jordan, sur
viving husband of the deceased. The
petition will be heard by Judge Coffey.
ENGLISH SEEKS TO ST,^Y
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS
Flics Petition Tor Writ to Prevent
Judge Fritz From Hearing
Charge of Bribery.
James A. English, charged by J. J.
Crowley, secretary of the California
State Board of Pharmacy, with
bribery, has applied to the Superior
Court for a writ of prohibition to pre
vent Judge Fritz from proceeding with
the hearing of the charge against him.
Crowley got a warrant for the arrest
of English on the ground that English
came to him and paid him a bribe of
$50 to procure the issuance to him
(English) of a certificate authorizing
him to practice pharmacy. Judge
Fritz, from whose court the warrant
was issued, intends taking up the case

"The spring movement in leading staples in

whi'.e it may not he us free as in other years,
it shows decided improvement over that of the
past few weeks. To come extent business is
restricted by the limited supplies of particur
larly seasonable eoodr. Â«urh as Feacbe.; and
Apricots, There are not many of theÂ»Â» here
end few to come forward from the coast, while
buyers are reluctant to pay the prices de
manded. The Prune siiuation. both here snd
on the coast, contirue* to reflect a Inn feeling
en the part of ho!ders. Business for forward
shipment from the coast, however, seems to
have been checked by the advance In the views
of these who hÂ«ve heretofore been classed as
low seners. There is no activity in spot Rais
ins seeded or Icxte-e. but there Is a quiet move
ment going "n which is steadily cleaning up

any attractions to buyers at present and there

pools Â»-ft* at work in them. The copper stockt!
and the rallrcad equipments had some share
in the show of ttrenirth. On the other hand,
Urn hexylncM in the railroad list was . quite
peneral. althoush ihe movement during the
â¢ day was hefttallr.p and irregular. Prices
touched a ' considerably- lower level, however,
than yesterday. It was supposed that pools
â¢ nr.<3 FpÂ«culati\* *yndicÂ£tes were unloading to
a cor"=;drrahle extent and there was M doubt
that ;he laojKjr oaUook was the principal mo
tive ; or this action. This was a sentimental ln
fluÂ»nc>f to come extent, as there was very lit
tle withdrawal of credit* by calling loans, ac
cording to the reports of money broker*. There
was. however, quite a large paying off of loans
on ca!!. which was followed by the precaution
ary lic.ui-ia.ticn of stocks. It was said that a
ro.isiderab:e part of the call loans paid off
were liquidated with the proceeds of new |
loan* of time. Operators in stocks hitherto
have refrained very persistently from taking
out time loans, even at the Invitingly low
sÂ«vÂ«i of rates, being satisfied to rely on day
to-day accommodations.
A feature of the day was the renewal of the
demand for gold from France, which made it
â¢fclf felt in London. This gave rise to renewed
conjecture* regarding a Russian loan and was
the cause of some uneasiness over some pos
sible disturbance* in France. This contrib
uted :o the weakness of the later stock mar- :
i-<- During the same period call loans fell
in 2 per cent. The market closed weak at
ebout the lowest.
Bonds were e&ey. Total sales, par value,
$3,685,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

JUDGE SAYS HUSH,
BUT WOMAN TALKS
NEGRESS SCOLDS COOLIE
Not Only Does She Arraign Him, but Pillories
His Afro-American Attorney.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Ah Tou, accused of having ma
liciously smashed a window in the
nbode of Mrs. Winifred Morton,
colored, at 209 Shipley street, cowered
in the witness chair and dumbly ap
pealed to Police Judge Mogan for pro
tection from the complainant's brow
beating as she cross-examined him.
But the bench and all its aids could
not stem the current of the woman's
anger. She not only prevented the
hapless Chinese telling a coherent
Ftory, but she bullied him into a si
lenco that was semi-affirmative of her
side of the case.
Briefly stated, Ah Tou's alleged of-
fence consisted of his breaking the
window in retaliation for Mrs. Mor
ton'.s delay in paying him for recalling
the seats of three of her sitting-room
chairs! She declared thatÂ«she was not
unduly tardy In settling his demand,
which was only 75 cents, while he
swore that the account had been run
ning for three months and that his
bill called for 52. It was his contra
diction of her fiscal statement that
provoked Mrs. Morton to abusive ut
terance.
"\V v. yo" po' mis'ble chink." she ex
claimed, towering over him with up
raised hand, ""wa" fo' yo' sit dah en roll
out dem lies ? How dayah try teh
n.akf me out a liah ? Fo' two pins
Ah'ci "
The accompanying swing of her arm
impelled Ah You to shrink and glance
beseechingly ai the Judge, but the
glance went unheeded.
â¢Didn't Ah pay you* moah den dem
mis'ble chaihs wuz wuff?" she con
tinued; "'en in yo' mean dispersition
didn't yo' fix a nail in wun ob dem
so dat Ah wud huht mahse'f w'en Ah
3at down? Didn't yo' do dat, yo' yal
ler trash, eh?"
'Dam ole foolee, " muttered Ah You.
"Did you' heah dat yah remahk,
Jedge?" shouted Mrs. Morton, in in
jured tone. "Am dis yah mis'ble chink
gwine teh be 'lowed to sit heah en use
insultery ter a 'speck'ble pusson?"
"This contention must cease," grave
ly responded his Honor. "You would
better address your protests to the de
it-nnEnt's attorney, Mr. Scott." /
"Mistah Scott â huh!" was the con
temptuous rejoinder. "Ah wants no
truck wif him or any oddah cullud
man wat'd pehFecute a cullud lady fo'
a nasty chink. Does Ah know Mistah
Seen? Well, Ah guess yep. Ah knows
pirn en Ah hez no use fo' him. He
stan's in de Bethel Church en tanks
de good Lawd lo" givin' him a new lease
ob life, en den he kirns down heah en
fights a po' ole niggah wumman lak
me fo' a heathen coolie. Ah doan want
tÂ»h do any talkin' teh Mistah Scott.
So. sah. Ah'll dress mah langwidge
reh de po' mis'ble chink what hiahed
him."
And she did, despite the protest of
an indignant defense. Ah You
squirmed under the toi^ue lashing.
,-.nd each time he attemftted to speak
phe shouted "Shet up!" so vociferously
as to make him jump. Finally the
Judge continued the rase till this
morning, remarking that he did not
consider St. Patrick's day a proper
time for him to decide a racial dispute.
Whereupon the clerk of the court, one
Patrick Gray, hummed the air of a once
popular song, the title of which is "St.
Patrick's Day Is a Bad Day for Coons."
â¦ â¢ â¢
Pedro Gonzales walked into Ah Sam's
pawnshop at Washington street and
Waverly place and drew from one of
his pockets a razor. Ah Sam no soon
er caught sight of the implement than
he uttered a yell of affright, bounded
over hiÂ« counter and to the street,
where he blew a shrill alarm on the
whistle, which all prudent Chinese
carry. Pedro Gonzales thereupon
dashed out of the shop and ran until
he was overtaken and arrested by Pa
trolman Hobl.
"These Chinese," said Pedro to Judge
Fritz, "are queer charactersâ so bub
piciouE. you know. Now when I went
into this chink's store and pulled the
razor I had no Intention of doing any
thing else than soaking it for as much
as I could get. But this timid heathen
evidently thought I was going to carve
him. How ridiculous."
Ah Sam, however, declared that It
was not so much the appearance of
the razor as the demeanor of the man
who possessed it that impelled him to
run. His impression then â and It had
remained unshakenâ was that rob
bery, attended with violence If neces
sary, was Mr. Gonsales* purpose, al
though no intlmidatory word was ut
tered.
The court gave Mr. Gonrales twen
ty-four hours' imprisonment for hav
ing fled when the policeman pursued.
Nine women charged with having
visited a place where pools on horse
races were sold smiled in unison when
their attorney succeeded in convincing
Judge Conlan that they could not
legally be convicted inasmuch as they
were jointly accused in the formal
complaint. Joseph Tuch, in a rear
room of whose cigar store on Geary
street the women were found and ar
rested, was pronounced guilty of pool
selllng and will be sentenced Monday
Mrs. Mary Berlin, who said she lived
at the Hotel Roslyn, escaped capture
during the raid, but was afterward
arrested on a warrant and will be tried
next Thursday.

bled like an aspen when he stood up for
sentence, ar.d when three months' im
prisonment was allotted him he tot
tered and would have fallen if the
sturdy arm of a bailiff had not been
held in readiness for just such an emer
gency. Then he was dragged to the
tanks.
E. C. Heine was fined $20 for dis
playing lewd pictures in the window
of his stationery shop, 139 Ellis street,
and the complaining witness, a clergy
man, was advised to enlist the postal
authorities in his meritorious crusade.
George Cornet, a chiropodist, ac
cused of battery by William Green of
1158 Missic-n street, exhibited a muti
lated lip and said it had been struck
with the fist of Mr. Green, who really
ought to be a defendant instead of a
complainant. Then, at the suggestion
of the court, he swore to a warrant
accusing his accuser of battery. Both
cases will be heard next Monday by
Judge Cabaniss.

James Gunn, arrested with Edward
Alvarado and Charles Boyd and booked
for vagrancy, told Judge Mogan that
he was a victim of hypnotic influence,
his- . Svengali . being Mr. ; Boyd, in whose
control he was helpless.
Then the arresting policeman told a
funny thfng. He scooped in the trio
from 26 Fish alley in Chinatown, where
Mr. Gunn was Â«n exhibition as a
"freak," while Mr. Alvarado "spieled"
at the door and Mr. Boyd served as
inside lecturer. The officer's attention
was attracted by the oratory of Mr.
Alvarado, addressed to a small but
deeply interested and apparently cred
ulous assemblage of Chinese, and
which consisted of an urgent appeal to
pay him 5 cents apiece for the privi
lege of stepping inside and gazing upos
one of nature's most remarkable ec
centricities.
"Dis human curiosity, gents," Mr.
Alvarado said, "wuz foun' in de Austra
lian bushes by some prospectors, and
wid great differculty dey indooced him
to stan' fer bein' put on exhibition. We
secured him at a termend'us expense
an 1 brought him to dis country, an' fer
de small sum of five cents â one nickel â
youse gents can see him. From head
ter foot he is marked wid strange hir
rygliphics, an' de pecooliar part of it
is dat he wuz born dat way. De Aus
tralian savage niggers captoored his
parents an' tattooed dem all over, an'
w'en de kid wuz born he had all de
marks dat his fadder an' mudder had

bein' de mos' remarkable specterkel

it. fer n>?x' week we resoom our jour
ney to Yurrup, w're de crowned heads
an' der scientific mugs are jist dy'n'
wid curiosity ter git a squint at him."
The policeman paid a nickel and
passed the portals. In a darkened
room he found Mr. Boyd and several
Chinese visitors standing over a pros
trate human form wrapped in a soiled
bed-sheet, and removal of the covering
disclosed Mr. Gunn in the "altogether,"
his body and limbs beint densely dot
ted and striped with crimson marks.
A brief glimpse only was permitted by
the lecturer, who explained that the
"freak" could not safely be subjected
to protracted exposure to the rather
chill atmosphere. 'Twas then the ar
rests were made.
Mr. Gunn confessed to Judge Caban
iss that the story of his having been
born an illustrated edition was tommy
rot, and said that his alleged inheri
tance was in reality a skin disease.
Then he told of the mysterious power
held over him by Mr. Boyd, and was
narrating instances of it when the
Judge casually glanced at Mr. Alva
rado and sharply inquired what was
the matter with his skin. "Poison

in Cave City, Kentucky
I The strong arm of the United States
i Secret Service department reached
! from Louisville, Ky.. yesterday : after-;
I noon and gripped ' the \ collar of Luke
Ray, alias Lee Smith, alias Lee Cole,
murderer ; and ; counterfeiter. r Ray '* is a
desperado of. a kind common in the
Southern States, but fortunately not
so numerous in the North. The credit
for : the capture belongs to United
States - Secret Service : Agents '.' George
W. Hazen and Thomas B. '' Foster and
they did the job in a remarkably brief
time. \. 'â â¢' " ":- : . â¢ :~* ' .. VV r ': '" '"."â 
, On March 12 the agents received _â¢ a
letter from United States Secret Ser
vice Agent S. A. Donella at Louisville,
Ky., j notifying them that : - Ray ,was
probably in California.' The letter in
closed a photograph and description of
the murderer, who was marked by a
scar, on the left cheekbone. X ,
/ The. history of Ray's career was giv
en as follows: "On September 16, 1903,
Chief Wilkie ! received a ; telegram ; an
nouncing the arrest of three negroes,
Ray, Tolley and Willis, charged with
passing raised bills at county ; fairs.
The chase had lasted: about a month
and on the morning of the capture the
secret service: men learned that the
three â  counterfeiters had , boarded . a
train for Cave City, Ky. The ..infor
mation was telegraphed to that place
and when the train arrived a < posse of
deputy sheriffs and citizens were wait
ing at , the depot. When an , attempt was
made to arrest the negroes they opened
fire on the posse and Ray killed one
of the *â¢ number named Sheppard. " Ray
and Tolley were captured and i Willis
escaped during the confusion. - Shortly
after the prisoners had been placed in
the Memphis jail Ray and Tolley broke
out, but Tolley was â¢ recaptured and
Ray escaped." " v ~ â â  , / -- '"
v; Hazen , and , Foster did not let the
grass grow under their feet, but started
on a : search at once. They visited ; all
the places \ usually resorted to by I ne
\ groes of the criminal class but without
success. * Then they went to all the
photograph galleries in which they
could find the photographs of negroes
and found at the establishment .of
Ãberti, Pera & Co. a picture of Ray but
without the scar. They called for the
negative- and saw that the scar on the
left cheek had been faithfully repro- j
duced, but : had been obliterated from j
the photograph at the request of Ray. !
The detectives ascertained that a man |
answering the description was work- <
ing as bartender at the Assembly Club j
on Bush street. Yesterday afternoon !
they saw : their man going down the j
steps | leading -to a ; race-track poolroom
in â¢ the . basement at the southwest ; cor- I

Martin O'Conor and Thomas

ASK FOE AX INJILNCTIOX
Claim That the Mayor Alone
Has Power to Fill the
Places Thej Xow Occupy
Martln A. O'Conor and Thomas P.
I O'Dcwd, in their capacity, they say,
; as taxpayers, have filed suit in the Su
; perior Court to oust from office the
\ board of trustees of the Free Public
Library of San Francisco. The plain
tiffs allege that the board is an illegal
body in that it was created by the
Legislature when it ratified the char
; ter, while the charter specifically vests
the Mayor with authority to fill all
appointive offices under the municipal
government.
The complaint, which was drawn by
Attorney Daniel O'Connell, asks that
the trustees^ â James O'Connor. George
T. Shaw, A. L. Man, P. N. Lillenthal,
E. R. Taylor. R. C. Harrison, C. M.
Boyd, Horace Davis, T. B. Bishop and
Sheldon G. Kellogg â be restrained
from longer usurping the office they
now hold and that Auditor Baehr be
enjoined from auditing any demands
they may file against the library fund.
Since the ratification of the charter
of the city and county of San Fran
cisco on January 26, 1899, the com
plaint continues, the trustees have
presented claims against the library
fund in excess of $65,000 and are about
to present demands against the same
for an amount in excess of $75^000.
POINTS THAT ARE RAISED.
Among the points raised by the
plaintiffs against the right of the in
cumbent trustees to hold office are the
following:
The said respondent* pretending members
of said board, pretend to hold office under and
by virtue of the second sentence o^f section 1
of chapter 7 of article VII of thÂ« said con
current resolution. But the said resolution
and charter is Inconsistent with the constitu
tion and laws of the United States, and the
constitution and general laws of this State,
In the following among other particulars :
It violates section 1 of the fourteenth
amendment of the constitution of the United
States by depriving the plaintiffs and othÂ«r
residents and taxpayers of said city and
county of their property without, due process
of law, and being within the jurisdiction of
said State, deprives them of the equal pro
tection of the laws of said State.
It violates section 25 of article XX of thÂ«

.-: r - Regarding the suit Daniel O'Connell,
attorney for the . plaintiffs, ; said :
s J The only purpose the plaintiffs have Is -to
prevent any violations of the constitution, and
to test the constitutionality of that part, and
i only that part â¢of the charter which provides
; for the â  appointment 'of the present members
jof . the board and their successors. .. â â¢â â¢ â  âº-: '
i In : fact, that ' Is . the only question In the
i case: 0. whether , the '. constitution of California
! has been violated by the provision of the State I
| cliarter ; contained 'â¢ In â  the ' second sentence of
i the first section of chapter. 7 of article VIII of
the charter, which is as follows: '
". "The board :of i trustees : of - said library and
reading-rooms in office at the time this char
i ter shall > take :â  effect, shall continue to Â« con-
I stitute : the board of trustees of said public li
brary and reading-rooms: and- all vacancies
therein shall bÂ» filled by said board." , ?
â¢If- that. is constitutional." then that ends the
case. - If it â is unconstitutional, then the board
of ; trustees. of the Public Library and reading
| rooms hold ' their. 1 offices " Illegally and have no
right to act therein. : . â¢ :
LAW COMPLIED WITH.
Of course, all thÂ» forms of law were strictly
complied - with in ; passing and , adopting :': the
charter, so far as the people : and Legislature
were concerned. ; Rut that does not decide that
I It is constitutional. very idea of a' con
1 stitution Jis to prevent * people from ' being the
! victim* of tyrany under the, forms of law. â 
â â %â  But :to i prevent ; them ' from Â» being . the victims '
' of tyranny, does not necessarily mean that there I
I must b* a i personal : tyrant. , - i Tor. the people !
i may -be ' the | victims : of | their, own .carelessness.
' or deceit, or ; confidence, as ; well jas being de
' ceived by others, and .It, Is to provide against
these consequences as much. If : not more, than I
the constitutions have .been framed. -
>': This Is a good proof of the old saying: â¢'That
men i will I and 1 have . signed ; petitions ; for their
own execution without knowing It." and al- I
though . this charter ; was * published in , news
paper* : for, months. â¢;I \- venture to say that
there < were âº few , people | who noticed ' this pro
vision. - â  â¢â¢'-; ..."' â¢.". -- : -?SgJ>lS^W'?SwKi*Ss
The plaintiffs claim that it also violates the
constitution vof S the â  United ? States, and ; ; that i
I would . give C them i the i right to take - thÂ» case
to x the t Supreme Court ' of .: the United States, !
I but we do not think L that will jbe necessary.
5 The case was assigned to Judge Heb
i bard '. f or ; hearing: ' and he ;' issued â an . or
der directing the respondents to appear
at 11 a. m. on March 24 to show cause
i why the prayer of the plaintiffs should
not be granted. â¢v\ ,-:',/;. > ? : .
