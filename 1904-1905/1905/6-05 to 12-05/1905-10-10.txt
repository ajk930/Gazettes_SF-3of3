Mrs. Keller and her daughter, Annie,
aged 18 years. were in the basement and.
were buried beneath fallen timbers and
the walls of the house. They ' escaped
serious injury, however. . Contractor
James Nlelron, who was putting some fin
isbins touches to the house/ and was on
the roof, was hurled through the air a
distance of twenty feet, receiving a num
ber of cuts and bruises on his face- and
hands. 1
As soon as possible Nielson summoned
assistance and set at worJt frantically
pulling the fallen walls and timbers from
over the basement so as to release * the
imprisoned women. This was - accom
plished after considerable difficulty.; \u25a0
Both ilxti. Keller and .her daughter had

almost completed. The walls were up and
the roof on and almost finished.'' The f vr r '
niture of the household'- had.'been',ar
ranged in place early this morning and :
the Kellers had established themselves In
their new home only a few hours before
the fierce wind destroyed It. . . '
Contractor Nielson had a few shingles
to put in place on the roof, and was thus
engaged when the blast came,' which
hurled him to the ground many yards
away. _'\u25a0 ;
The house was of five rooms, with attic
and b.-.si -inont. It had been built by day's
labor and was believed to be more than
usualy strong. â¢' â¢ ' \u25a0
The wind began blowing strong soon
after daybreak this morning and - In
creased in velocity until 11:30 o'clock,
\u25a0when the culmination was reached. It
was tt this time that the blast of hurrir
cane violence reduced the Keller home to
splinters and fragments of wood.

REDDING. Oct. 9.â Two highwaymen,
one. of whom remained concealed during
tvÂ»| entire operation, planned and partly
executed tho robbery oÂ£ the Redding and
Delamar stage to-day, shot Express Mes
sengtr Dan Haskell and are now twins
pursued through the woods skirting Pit
River within eighteen ni.ics j of. Redding.
by a hundred armed men. |
The. stage left Redding at 1 o'clock. this
morning carrying in money nearly $10,000
with which to pay off the employes of the
Bully Hill smelter and mine. Wells, Far
go & Co.'s messenger. Haskell, who3e
regular run la between Redding and
Weavervillc. accompanied the stage to
De-lamar a3 guard; Thare v.*ere no pas
sengers^ Driver puTfor occupied the front
seat alone, while Messenger Haakell oc
cupied : the second and middle seat.
As the st.ige rolled down a small Incline
In th- road a mile and three-quarters
west of Bear Vailey itu unmasked man
appeared from behind "a ;aort *ot impro-'
vised shield alonsslrle the road about tit
ty yards ahead of" the > stage and. yelled
, up-^ your hands.*iâ \u25a0 Driver
Durtor Ignored the" eomaaaad and whipped
up hia horses. As he did so /the robber
began to shoot.
.Thfr:, first bullet struck Haskell in the
abdomen,' the second crashed through his
left foot.' -while a third, flretl after Haskell
had ! discharged both barrels of . his shot
gun and aimed his revolver,' shattered the
cylinder of the last named weapon. This
bull tt would have struck Haskell in the
head had not the "revolver stopped it.
; Durf or continued to urge his horses and
the robber followed the stage for a hun
dred yards, keeping up a running: fire.
One bullet pierced the letter sack and
another the paper sack of the
States mail. Finally the robber was dis
tanced, and Durfor, driving with one hand
and holdlns to hi 3 seat with the other
the wounded messenger who was suffer
ing intense pain, drove to Bear Valley.
from which place Marlon Gregory went
to Pit River bridge and telephoned to
Redding and Delamar. .
Fosses ' from both places went out and
Dr. White_with Mrs. Haskell and R. G.
Dunn left to get the wounded man. who
was brought to Redding to-night. His
injuries are serious, but axe not consid
ered fatal. The -posses found evidence
that two men were implicated In the; rob
ber}', but v-hy the second failed to take a
hand Is a. mystery. ThÂ« robbers' were
evidently joined together by a 100-yard
rope, used evidently for signal purposes.
The' robber that did the work wore no
mask and can be identified by the driver.
Haskell, the woundf * messenger, has
served with Wells- Fargo Company for
twenty years and this is his flrat experi
ence with road agents. He is a crack
shot and at one time was chief of police
of San Jose, and later Under Sheriff of
Santa Clara. There is strong talk of
lynching if either of the - is
caugat.
Under Sheriff Behrens returned lato to
night from the' chase after -the stage
robber. . He says the theory of two rob
bers has -been abandoned, as It is now
believed tfce cord found was < originally
attached to, the trigger of a gun set near
the road. '.The posse from Delamar is on
the trail of the robber, who is heading
toward Pit -River. Another dossÂ© .iÂ»
skirting the river on the opposite side.
Bloodhounds will be used to-morrow.

WOULD RETIRE
AGED OFFICERS
WASHINGTON, Oct. -Â».â ln-his -second
annual report to the Secretary . of War
Brigadier General Constant Williams,' in
command of the Department of the Co
lumbia, expresses decided views about
the inexpediency of retaining in the mili
tary services officers who, by reason of
age, mental condition â¢ or physical ail
ments, are unable to endure the -hardest
field service and intelligently direct their
troops. He would have no captain over
the age ot 40 years, and he suggests a
rigid physical, mental and technical ex
amination for every office before he shall
be placed in command of a regimentl
A corollary of. 4his project is a plan
for the compulsory retirement of officers
to insure the accession to high commands
of men young enough for active field
work.
General Williams also urges a more
liberal treatment of officers in the mat
ter of expenses. He thinks they should
not be obliged to pay for the heating
and lighting .of their quarters and that
they shouid be provided with mounts
at Government expense.
He also suggests improved, form' of
ofllcers" mess. * '
The strengthening of the sea coast
formications on the North Pacific Coast
is urged. Â£In â¢, Alaska, he believes, Fort
Davis, near Nome, might be profitably
abandoned, and Fort Michael ;Reserva
tion should be Considerably reduced in
size, retaining only so much land as Is
necessary for military service.
! Like every one of the general officers
of 'the army commanding the great mili
tary divisions and departments who have
yet been heard from on the subject (and
only one remains to report this year).
General Williams urges the restoration
of the army canteen, saying: â¢ \u25a0:'.
This is a most unusual and Interesting ques
tion. lor In it we find the -union ot the two
most antagonistic e.ernenta in American so
ciety working: hand in hand against the best
interests of the "soldier. . In the first place
we have -the great temperance societies, whose
general, influence for eood ; and noblÂ«..work
cannot be too highly commended, ; but which
in this particular case, with the best possible
Intentions. â¢ are making â¢\u25a0 a * serious mistake.
Joined with them in the agitation against the
army canteen are the production of whisky and
their creatures, the saloon-keepers, who make
a livelihood . by the sale of , alcoholic drinks,:
often of a most . unwholesome - and villainous
character. The Whisky guild argues quite cor
rectly that if -the ; soldier be prevented , from
getting bitter and light wines In the canteen
he will be virtually forced to patronize .the
saloons and doggeries, which,' under this sys
tem, have ! spruce - tip like t mushrooms at the
very sates of all armjr srarrlsons. â¢ â¢â¢â¢ , â¢
As an example, in Vancouver, with a'popu
lation of about \u25a0\u25a0 4000,' .there are twemy-two
saloons, all situated as near . the garrison ; as
practicable. Seme of them, in addition to
tilling a poor quality of whisky, also furnish
facilities for gambling "and prostitution.' 'To
these immoral dene -of . Infamy ' the * canteen
law is a big dividend-paying - charter, jKi vlng
them power . to ; degrade, â¢; demoralise : ancL rob
tbe American soldier. '. '

D: G Doubleday and
Party Receive
Shaking LJ p.
( - Two powerful automobiles, one iol
I them containing three well-known peo-'
pie of this city,' a Cnicago.business man
and a baby, and the other a resident of
San Jose, came together on the ' public
highway ten miles this'sideof the Gar
den City Sunday afternoon. Three of the
people landed in trie road'and both
the heavy cars were damaged, but
*no person suffered serious . injury.
The San Francisco party returned to
San Jose by train -yesterday and re
turned in their rehabilitated automobile
. late last night. . ;
In the automobile coming toward
San Francisco were Dean : G. Double
day, broker,' and his wife . and little
child. Miss Catherine Cecil of 630 TSddy
street and Robert Gates, . a Chicago
business man- staying at. the.. Palace.
The lone occupant of the-San^Jpse car
was John Wetmore of the.** Garden City.
Mr. Doubleday, who 'owns; the machine
in which hisparty wasimaking the trip,
was actirig'as his own' chauffeur. This
is the story of the collision as told by
one of the Doubleday party: .
BUS OBSTRUCTS VIEW.
--."WeJeft San Francisco Sunday morn
ing at .9:30 and started: on the return
trip from San Jose about ,4 o'clock.
About ten miles this side of Sari Jose
we noticed a heavy -car- with : a young
man driving coming down a grade jwe
were ascending. This machine seemed
to be zigzagging toward us. Present
ly- a vehicle that "seemed like a large
bus came nearer the right side, of the
road,, which we 1 were taking, and the
other automobile was lost to view be
hind It for a few seconds.
"Suddenly' the. big. car with the one
occupant shot out 'from behind: the bus
and bore directly down'upoh us. : It was
only an. instant before the" collision
came, but /Mr.' Doubleday'called out: , 'It
looks as.lf we were in for ah accident.'
He had 'hardly spoken .when the-colli
sion came." \ â¢
.After, the accident ; two ; badly dam
aged cars sat panting onthe road, help
less, after the first tilt of battle. Mrs.
Doubleday was in, the i-/ bottom of \ the
San Franclscoauto,. where she had been
thrown on topof her baby girl.' Double
day sat .sternly at the wheel of his Ma
chine. Miss Cecil.VGates and Wetrriore
were .strugglingr to" their, feet. V Gates
had jumped- when. he saw the collision
was inevitable and Miss Cecil and Wet
more had. both been. thrown out by the
force of impact. . :
BOTH AUTOS DAMAGED.
The only individual .hurt; ito any\no
tlceable . extent was - Wetmore. ..â¢ One of
his hands was lacerated and a ' leg
bruised.' Mrs. : Doubleday, was .slightly
bruised. All tne, others escaped with
out hurts of any kind. C" ',\u25a0';. \u25a0 ";
"We \u25a0 tri ed to learn % the name': of the
man whose" machine 'h^d* run' into ours,"
6aid one of. the Doubleday party, .'but
he was . the dumbest individual I ever
caw. He. simply went about 'repairing,
his machine so it would run. to "San

any subject." 'V
, It was > found that ; Wetmore's. auto

Neither side . .will | give figures ." as
to the total number of proxies controlled;
but the Gould party declared to-night
that the decision of Judge Taylor, in St.
Louis, which gives to Gould practically
140,000 votesv meant nothing ito him as far"
as ability to control the meeting is â¢ con.
cerned. No 'matter how that case-;, was

"We will know all about ; it to-morrow."
The decision \u25a0of Judg-e Taylor in . St.\

Ramsey 5 all the votes controlled by the
Missouri Pacific and Iron Mountain railr
roads, was mentioned in court this after
noon by ( John Doyle, Ramsey's attorney,
as "this important decision, affecting: fully .
one-thirtieth of all the votes." Ramsey
himself,' <1W not. outwardly at least, in

his lawyer.' He said: \u25a0\u25a0 "There is nothing
I ran say. . The decision speaks for it
self. It is not decisive, however, and .is
only one trick in the game."
However, at a conference held. at noon
between ', Ramsey and his attorneys, it
was decided, in view of the decision; of
Judge Taylor, to abandon the fight
started by Ramsey for the removal of the
three' men' who have for ; several!' years

PHENOMENAL
\u25a0 WORK DONE
Fire From Hills
Is Hard to
Control.
BERKELEY. Oct. 9.â President Wheel
er's promptness in giving the word that
transformtd one ihousanJ university stu
dents into a regiment of s-svift and willing
fire-fighters saved a vast amount of uni
versity property from destruction :o-day
by flames that swept in mighty sheet's
down the hi'lstdts buck of the university.
For five hours all college classes were
Gusptnded. while the university ntn, un
der Prseident Wheeler's personal direc
tion, fought back these tires. Their cloth
ing was burned, their faces seared, and
scorched and their hair was singed by
the menacing names, but th^ university
xnen battled steadily against the fires and
in the end they won a notable victory.
Their wcrk saved not only a great deal
of university properly, but brought safe
out of a desperate situation the magnifi
cent homes of a score of wealthy citizens,
some of them college professors, some |
capitalists and all in the path cf the flame j
cloud- that came down from the hills and
threatened the destruction of part of the
fairest residence district of Eerkeley and
Claremont. - .
A wiadstcna made possible the spread
ing cf the flames, Enabling them to be
carried over peak after peak in the hills
back of the university, finally pending the
red tongues on !n:o the Oiaremont dis
trict, miles from the original starting
-^rioinl of the fire. The State Institute for
j :he Dc-af, Dumb and Blind was in
, â¢ the path of the fkiirses. but danger to the
.' buildings there was averted by the work
â¢of the inmates, who put out the wieps of
flame as they were carried by. the wind
from the" hills into the grass ami brush
back of the institute.
The university students, after working
for nt'ariy two hours in Strawberry Can
yon, where the fire seemed to be most j
threatening during the morning, moved ;
. on to Ciarcmcnt at 2 o'clock when word
. was brousht to them that the residence j
of Judgv Garber. James and Whitney
Palache and others were in danger. Their
work in C'laremont was of the same order
as on the university groundsâ skillful,
systematic effective. vÂ»:*.
Fire Chief Kenny, who had the entire
\u25a0 firo department out during the day, could
rpj. speak strongiy enough in praise of
thÂ«Â»*worfc of the students. " -*\u25a0

I PRESIDENT WHEELER. AIDED B% THE FACULTY AXD STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, FIGHTING l
i BACK THE FLAMES THAT SWEPT .-DOWN UPON THE STATE'S INSTITUTION OF LEARNING AT BERKELEY YESTER- '
J DAY. THREATENING MANY OF THK BUILDINGS WITH DESTRUCTION. . -
fire as that which these university boys
have done to-day. "Magnificent Is the only
word for it. It was superb, \u25a0 and I take
off my hat to men. They saved
Berkeley, the university and Claremont
from what might have been a great dis
aster."
At 4 o'clock the flre was practically un
der control. All the Claremont residences
were pronounced to be out of danger. The
fires on the bills alongside Strawberry
Canyon were in such shape that no dan
ger was apprehended from them. An in
ventory of the situation showed that the
actual damage was confined to the de
struction of much of \V. T. Such's pasture
land and an occasional fence, which the
fire-fighters permitted to be burned while
they gave their time to the saving of
more valuable, property.
When it became apparent that five
hours of strenuous fighting had saved
the day, and that the university stu
dents were victorious, there went up
from the great throng of college men
on the hills a highty "Oski Wow Wow!"
They had won the* day, and an "Oski
Wow Wow!" was a fitting climax to
the struggle.
The spectacle presented by the flames
and the fire-fighters in Strawberry Can
yon vraa picturesque enough to satisfy
the most satisfying artist in search of
'hues and figure for a canvas. The fire
had its origin high up on the grassy
sides of Grizzly Peak, and it swept
down the range of hills toward the
Greek Theater, the wind carrying -the
flre brands so that in a very^short time
the entire hillside . had been denuded
of vegetation.
President Wheeler ordered all classes
dismissed at 11 o'clock, when it became
apparent that the- fire 'threatened
the destruction of the. university prop
erty, and after turning in an alarm and
calling for- the Berkeley- firemen he
asked the student body to volunteer
as fire-fighters. . Captain Nance was
drilling hundreds of students, but drill
was stopped 'and under President-
Wheeler and Captain Nance the col
lege men hurried up the hilside. They,
carried hundreds of wet sacks, which
had been provided by Marshal Vollmer,
Fire Chief Kenny and Superintendent
1~ A. Hugill of the university, grounds.
Up past the Greek Theater the attack
on the flfcmes was begun. Trie flre'had_
come t<J within a~ few hundred feet of
the theater when- it wjjs attacked. The
grove of trees surrounding the theater
was saved through the efforts of the
students. â¢_
Then it was seen that the flames
had been carried to Strawberry Can
yon. Such's dairy, at the head of the
canyon, was surrounded by burning '
brush. Farther down the canyon.are
the university dairy buildings, and on
the southern side of the. canyon stand
handsome residences, including Profes
sor Relber's new house and many oth
ers. All these were in the line of the
fire, and the "wind was carrying the J
flames their way. The students were
put at work in this canyon, on the hill
sides, back-firing the blaze. It was
dangerous work for amateur flre-'
fighters. \u0084 '
President Wheeler -worked side by
side .with the men, carrying a wet sack
and using it when. possible, and direct
ing throughout the operations of the
collegians.
Hatless, coatless, faces begrimed, hair
singed, 'losing all dignity and ignoring
the loss, college professors. worked might- '
lly, battling with (he flames, and their ;
work vras v effective. One could see Pro-'^

tion was deemed to be so critical that
none could afford to' leave and there was
little rest for any.
Professor Rieber helped the' students
haul lumber that was in danger of burn
ing near the Rieber house and the action
was taken none too' sone, for had the
detached lumber got afire the house could
hardly have been saved.
The alarm of the Claremont district
people was evidenced by their calls over
the telephone for assistance from any
quarter in Berkeley or Oakland that
could provide help. A female member
;f Whitney Palache's house telephoned
Trantlcally for help, saying that- flames
surrounded the house and that Judge
John Garber's fine home was also
threatened.
Then the students, having got the situa
tion In Strawberry Canyon under control,'
hastened with Fire Chief Kenny to Clare
mont and they were Just in time. Their
work was effective in saving Judge Gar
ber's property and the Palache residences
as well. An hour of work in that^ dis
trict exhausted the students after their
wearying efforts earlier in the day and
many of them were obliged to be taken
home exhausted. â¢ , . ,
! A guard of five men is to keep watch
in Strawberry Canyon to-night to give the
alarm should the smoldering flames
again become active. Little further dan
ger "from the tire Is -. apprehended, .how
ever, and the students will sleep on,their
laurels, gained in a day of heroic work
under trying conditions against wind and
fire, where water was scarce. '
So much attention was paid to
checking the fire on the Alameda
County side of the ridge that the sweep
over into Contra Costa County wafs
forgotten. While the students and
volunteers were -fighting to save 'the
homes along the Berkeley line and
preventing It from : getting; Into Oak
land ,the flames "made a -run; over the
top of the .bills and down into the can
yons-, on the, Contra Costa- side; Here
larger brush 1 furnished better fuel for
the flames and from the top of thei di
vide,, flre 'could be (Seen -sweeping : In
every direction., :The , scene toward
evening was magnificent" to all,- save
those who had property in that sec
tion; Fife was .running In every; dlrec*
tion and as a particularly ' large J pile
of brush was reached 'the flames would
shoot skyward,' only to die down'- and'
reappear In another direction. -' : .
The fire worked Its way over toward
the tunnel road arid ' lnto the Fish
Ranch Canyon. * ' It ; came within a few
hundred yardiv of the. Buckley . place
at the foot of the. tunnel.
The Board of Town Trustees to-night,
on recommendation of Fire Chief James
Kenny, . adopted t, resolutions :of .thanks
to the students of x the University, of

to-day -which saved the university and

Try to Restore Order and
Get -Down to Legislation
BUDAPEST. Oct. 9.â When Parliament
reassembled to-day it waa to face a situ
ation of .the greatest confusion. The
compromise programme which the coali
tion leaders requested Herr yon Szogy
enyi-Marich, the Austro-Hungarlan Em
bassador at' Berlin (at present on his es
tate at Czor. Hungary), to submit to the
King-Emperor, has seemingly, proved &
failure. as his Majesty has not yet indi
cated any Intention to receive the Era
bassador for this purpose.
Great r numbers of students will pro
ceed to 'the Parliament buildings to-mor
row, air wearing mourning and carrying
a black coffln inscribed "The constitution
has expired." .
. All possible steps have been taken to
secure order during the. sitting. The
coalition leaders have abandoned their
original Intention to disregard the royal
messages \u2666 again proroguing the Diet.
They will protest against permanent ad
journment, but will respect the Klng-Em
perorjs message. No serious street dis
orders are feared.
According to the newspapers General
Baron Fejervary has already been re
appointed Premier. It is reported that
the coalition parties have decided to
abandon the proposal! to move, on the re
assembling of the Diet to-morrow, the
impeachment of the .Fejervary Cabinet.
It Is understood that Baron Fejervary
will make a statement to the House to
morrow that a new government has not
yet been formed and. therefore the House
will be again prorogued. Count Julius
Andrassy will read a resolution of pro
test adopted by the coalition to-day de
claring that the continued prorogations
of Parliament are unconstitutional be
cause they render it impossible to Im
peach the Fejervary Cabinet, while the
coalition, being a â¢ parliamentary major
ity, should long ago have been entrusted
with the direction of the government.
The resolution further declares that the
existence of the Fejervary Cabinet ta
nothing but absolutism.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â Out of the for
ty-second International sanitary confer
ence of American republics, which be
gan in the New Williard Hotel to-day,
will grow a movement for a world-wide
league of governments against communi
cable diseases. The co-operation be
tween the governments of the western
hemisphere has proved so effective in
combating dangerous epidemics that
International sanitary conferences par
ticipated in by all countries are now con
sidered as necessary as International
peace conferences.
Nearly every American government
was represented when Surgeon General
Wyman of the Public Health and Marine
Hospital Service called the convention to
order this morning. He said he felt no
doubt the good results of the' conference
held two years ago would appear in the
reports of the delegates to this confer
ence. HÂ« described as an instance the
manner in which the United States and
Mexico co-operated to prevent In l!Â«b
a recurrence of the yellow fever epidemic,
which made its appearance In 1903
Dr. Liceaga of the Superior Board of
Health of Mexico, who worked with Dr.
Wyman at that time, is Mexico's repre
sentative in the present conference.
Secretary of State Root, who v.-Â«^comed
tho delegates and extended to them the
good wishes of the United States tor the
success in all their effort?, said:
"It Is the wish of the United States to
forw-rd thÂ« work of peace and harmony
among all peoDles. I do not know that
the average intellect among men is any
more powerful than it was one thousand
years ago, but a concentration bfÂ«ilort
makes possible what would not have been
sslble a few generations ago. You,
therefore, can Hceomplish more than did
your predecessors."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SIOUX CITY. lowa, Oct. 9.â When the
members of the family of Dr. TV. TV.
Ordway. at Onawa received a telegram
this afternoon announcing. that he was
dylng t in Los Angeles, it was conceded
that one of ..the 1 most remarkable ca
reers in- the . anals of lowa was being
brought 1 , to' a* close. ..'
Dr. Ordway is a multi-millionaire.
Los' Angeles ia his winter residence
and of .late years lie has spent most
of his time^there. He. has been famous
throughout Western lowa as. the luck
iest man that ever lived, yet he hais
been robbed eight times during his life.
The latest . robbery occurred at Los
Angeles last month, when robbers
burned his residence and made away
with fi satchel containing $150,000 in
Government bonds and ?500 in gold.
The bonds were hurled back Into the
flames by the escaping thieve^ In their
fright, evidently because of an impres
sion :that they were worthless secur
ities. Dr. Ordway recovered flhem
from the fire and those who knew him
here predict that he will ultimately re
cover the gold.
The first serious robbery took place in
1555,. when he was relieved of $30,000 in
gold. The entire sum .was returned to
him ( a few months later, together with
$112 interest, the thief explaining in an
accompanying/' leter that he. had j joined
a church and expected. to die with a clear
conscience. On the. night of January 2,
1885, three desperate thieves. attacked him
in his residence. 'A terrific struggle in the
dark ensued and" Ordway was shot. in the
head with: buckshot; yet he 'miraculously
survived. A moment later one of the rob-r.
bers was about to brain him with an ax
when one of the others prevailed upon
him to desist. The doctor hung ; on to the
gun and cap: of his assailant and subse
quently used these as a means of identi
fying the robbers, who were captured and
brought to trial, with the result that- they,
received, long 'sentences. \u25a0 ...
Strangely.: enough, the six-, subsequent
robberies; were .attended with similar
good -fortune, in that, the doctor either
recovered the | plunder^or succeeded in
j protecting, most ,qf-;hifl:, valuables. ; ,
The many attempts .to rob him were oc
casioned .; by. j: the â¢\u25a0 knowledge that he pa
tronized no bank . and yet was -.very
' wealthy. .

Fusion Ticket Can
Rely on Eleven
Careful Estimates
Point to Signal
Triumph
X few days prior to the municipal elec
tion of November. 1903, The Call predict
ed that Henry J. Crocker, the Republican
nominee, although there were three tick
ets in the field, would carry nine Assem
bly districts. At a. matter of fact h% did
carry eight, namely, the Thirty-fifth, Thir
ty-seventh. Thirty-tighth, Fortieth. For
ty-first. Forty-6econd. Forty-third and
Forty-fourth. The Thirty-fourth was lost
to the Republican nominee by' a narrow
margin. In these districts Crocker re
ceived 12,060 votes.
Partridge on November 7 will get a
rauoh larger Republican vote in these dis
tricts than was given to Crocker by rea
\u25a0on ot the increased registration and the
reneral awakening of the city to the dan
fferoua tendencies of Ruef and Schmitz.
The Republican vote in these eight dis
tricts next month will approximate 16,000.
In the s&xne districts in 1508 the vote for
Lane wag 6648. There is every indication
that Partridge will get a larger vote from
the democratic column than Lane re
ceived. A fair prediction of the Demo
cratic vote for Partridge in these eight
â¬istrlcta is 7500. This would give Part
ridge 13,500 votes in the eight Republican
districts.
In the other districts, ten in number,
Partridge will get fully 14,000 votes or
urn tT.SOO votes in the city. In these ten vuÃ
j tricts two years ago Crocker received 7545
rotes and Lane 6030, a vote combined of
13.5T5.
There is a fine prospect that Partridge
\u25a0will carry eleven of the eighteen Assem
bly districts, namely, the Thirty-fourth,
Thirty -aich. Thirty-sixth, Thirty-seventh,
Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth,
Fortieth, Forty-first, Forty-second. For
ty-third and Forty-fourth. Schmitz will
probably win in the Twenty-eighth, Twen
ty-ninth, Thirtieth, Thirty-nrÂ«t, Thirty
second, Thirty-third and Forty-fifth, but
his majority in each will be slender com
pared with his plurality two years ago,
vhen the anti-Ruef vote was divided, one-
Sialf going to Crocker and the other half
to Lane.
Two years ago the combined vote of
CrocKPr and Lane was 6000 in excess of
the vote cast for Schmitz. It . can .be
Â«ff!y reckoned that^an- Francisco 'con
tains 12.000 Democrats who will not vott
th*Â» : Ruef-Schmitr ticket under, any con
ditions.
When Schmitz ran the first time
12.642 Democrat* voted . for Tobln.
TThen Schmitz ran the second time
22.550 Democrats voted, for Lane. It
Is not a wild estimate to place, the
Democratic vote for Partridge at. 14,000
end the Republican .vote for Partridge
at 23.500. .-.. .
The gangsters of the . Ruef -Schmitz
administration, having control of the
police and other departments of the
city government, may bring to the polls
80,000 Schmitz voters, or 4000 ;\ more
than were brought out two years ago

MAYOR SCHMITZ
DRAWS CROWDS
Ends First Week by
Toasting the
Fusionists.
Mayor Schmitz closed his first week of
campaigning for himself and the other
candidates of the Union Labor party last
night by attacking many *of the fusion
candidates for office andj branding them
as creatures of the Citizens' Alliance. He
offered no proof that these men were.con
trolled by this organization, but he re-
Iterated his statement to this effect time
after time. .After each outburst he was
applauded by the crowd of voters and
boys who attended the meetings.
Henry U. Brandensteln was the chief
object of the Mayor's attack. By direct
insinuation Schmitz left -the 'impression
that the Fusion' candidate for District At
torney was controlled by capitalists and
that if he were placed in office the af
fairs of the city would be run by the
corporations, a ; result which would end
in bloodshed and Industrial war. "Give
me a District Attorney," cried Schmitz,
"and . a Board of Supervisors who will
back me in all that I do and I will give
the clty_reforms such as they have never
yet ,dreamed ; of."
For the first time since the campaign
was begun Mayor Schmitz directly stated
that the recent Grand Jury was a body
packed and organized by the ,- -wizens'
Alliance for the especial j purpose of find
ing something criminal In his administra
tion. He has hinted at thia at every meet
ing, but not until last night did he open
ly allege tnat the formation of the last
Grand Jury was actually planned before
hand. "The Citizens- Alliance organized
the last Grand Jury," he said, "and I
speak the words advisedly,' for the sole
purpose of picking . a flaw in 4ny admin
istration. They could not do it, even
though they went through my every act
with a fine tooth comb. They found no
graft. If there had \u25a0 been graft there It
would have been found by- them. If there
was any graft in my- administration It
would not . take a fusion ticket to beat
me;, the weakest ticket that - could be
formed would be successful under such
conditions." â¢ . V
\u25a0 The â¢ first meeting last night . waa held
within ; a small hall in the . Thirty-second
district. â¢' The house was crowded.- O.';A-

The large registration and the deep in

that the vote will be' ? close â¢' to. that
mark. <The : larger f the , vote the I better
it will be f for the fusion ticket. .
Republicans â¢ arid ! Democrats j are now
\u25a0working toother harmoniously In sup
port of the cause of common j honesty
inithe 'administration of* city affairs.
Two year's ago the Republicans jf ought
earnestly to detach votes from^Lane's
column for Crocker and the Democrats
strove with zeal to win votes'- from
Crocker's forces to help Lane's candif
dacy.* Ruef did everything that acun
ning politician could do to embitter the
struggle between Lane j and Crocker.
He' was so -apprehensive, that a great
rush for Crocker would take place that
he packed a Lane meeting at . the Pa
vilion with his â¢ own henchmen and
created the public impression . that Lane
was the favorite. ' - - -.
In -this campaign . both ; Republicans
and Democrats are â¢ working to | detach
votes from Schmitz's column. .Accounts
received jfavti fusion headquarters , are |tq
the effect that \ the work^is beginning
to tell in' the- districts south of .Market
street. ; ' \u25a0\u25a0'..â¢--. - ...-., ?rh-f.\
It is the Judgment , of *citizens> gen

acted wisely in selecting M,r. Partridge
as the nominee : for' Mayor. His candi
dacy is steadily growing in public
favor, and the', clear-headed .politicians
predict his election. .,:-. V

HOLDS INDICTMENTS
OF HASSE ARE LEGAL
Must Stand Trial on Charges
of Stuffing Stationery
Bills.
OAKLAND. Oct. 9.â The effort to knock
out by demurrer the indictments returned
by the Grand Jury against Otto L..Hasse
failed tÂ»-day, and he must now go to
trial on a charge of having presented
false and fraudulent claims to the Board
of Supervisors . for stationery. Judge
Henry Melvin this aftemon overruled the
demurrer to the indictments and Hasse
was ordered to appear in court next Fri
day morning and enter his plea to the
charges made.
The hearing of the demurrer has con
sumed several days owing to the fact
that It embraced a general statement to
the effect that the Grand Jury was biased
by outside information when it found the
indictments. All -of the: members were
brought into court and examined, and
after tbis had been uone technical objec
tions were made to tne wording of the
indictments themselves.
HOWE'S IRK AROUSED.
OAKLAND, Oct. 9. â Another phase of
the feud existing for some time be
tween County Assessor Henry P. Dal
ton and Supervisor W. D." Rowe de
veloped to-day at the meeting of the
Board of Supervisors. â¢ It arose over the
claim presented by the Enquirer Pub
lishing Company for $436 for binding
block books and assessment rolls as
ordered by the Assessor. Attorney
Charles K. Snook, representing the
printers, asked to have the Eoard of
Supervisors make some disposition of
the bill. Chairman Mitchell and Super
visor Kclley favored paying the claim.
â¢Then Supervisor Rowe declared that
he would not vote for the claim under
any circumstances, even though ordered
to do so by a couru He said that he
would resign his office first. Rowe fur
ther asserted that Assessor DaJton, In
the interest of his own petty politics,
had for years been ordering whatever
supplies for his office he pleased with
out authorization by the Board of Su
pervisors, thus imposing on the board.
Before Supervisor Talcott could say
how he stood he was summoneQ to a
fire at Fruitvale. The claim went over
one week.

Hazel Scott Flees

She Hastens
to City.â¢ '
OAKLvAND, Oct. 9.-Snubbed by 7 her"
schoolmates until the torment became un*
endurable, Hazel Scott, 12 years old, a
slip of" agiri; fled yesterday from her
ranch \u25a0 home near O'Neals, thirty miles
east of Madera, , determined to end her
childish troubles by going to San Fran
cisco. In preparation the determined and
vexed child saddled her own' horse, stole
a: check â¢ belonging to George Scott, her
father, rode to Madera last night, cashed
the paper for its face, $30, and this morn-
Ing took the train for the city. *
The runaway girl's flight was interrupt
ed at the Sixteenth-street station by De
tective Frank Lynch, who. holding ad
vices from Sheriff J. M. Jones, of Madera,
took charge of the child. She was given
over to Sheriff Barnefs care, awaiting
arrival to-morrow of Sheriff Jones. â¢'
Hazel said she had been snubbed at
school ever since last Thursday.. When,
the children played at their games they 1
overlooked her, and for what reason the
girl declared she could not tell. And she
continued: < \u25a0 .
"I told- my parents about it, but that
didn't do any good, so I decided to leave.
After I got the check I rode to Madera,
arriving yesterday afternoon. I put my
horse in Cm tin's stable and went to Rues
Macy's hotel and gave him the check,
which he cashed for me this morning.
After I had bought a new pair of shoes
for $4 and' a new hat; for $2 60 I got a
ticket to San Francisco and took the
train, intending to go to my sister, Miss
La Verne Scott, at 238 Sixth street, San
Francisco."
Hazel was told that she would be re
turned home to-morrow and her comment
was: "I guess I am satisfied."
After her.. disappearance she was traced
by her fauier to Madera and was easily
found on the train.

Mrs. Taylor's story, which 'is* so

was- very helpful, says Mrs.' Taylor, but
soon the lat,ter _ realized that" sh*e v her-:

the- creature of 'the "aged 'woman's will.

Mrs. .Atwater 7 compelled her to deed to
her some realty in' Berkeley. ijrs. "At

EXCURSION PAETY
RETURNS DEJECTED
Sunday's Â»Trip to the Sierras
Proves a Trying
' One.
The twelve hundred excursionists from
this city and Oakland, who were stalled
in their cars on the Sierra Railway the
greater part of .Sunday, reached this city
yesterday morning: at 11 o'clock, fully
impressed with some very strong Ideas
regarding railroading in Tuolumne Coun
ty and as hungry as one could be ex
pected to be after seventeen hours on the
road without food. " '\u25a0
-.The Santa Fe officials lay the blame
for S the unexpected interruption to; â¢ the
â¢Sunday excursion- to ; the "Inadequacy of
the Sierra . Railway : Company; and | the
latter charges the ; affair .up to this year's
dearth of rain in the' mtninr region,
which, It is claimed, has caused a great
scarcity of-water. ;.:
- Sunday's -excursion was jointly ar
â¢ranged by the Santa Fe and th 4 Sierra
Railway, the former switching its, cars
to the mountain road at Oakdale. It
was originally, figured that about 300 per
sons - would" make the trip.. Instead this
number was . augmented by about 900 and
when the Santa Fe's special of nineteen
cars reached Oakdale. they were divided
Into four sections and turned over to the
connecting road. That was about 2:30
o'clock in the afternoon and an hour and
a half later the four trains were stalled
about sixteen miles this side of - Sonora/
The announcement was made that wat
er had given out and the company would
-be unable to haul its trains any farther.
Steam was finally gotten up again, how
ever,\and at 11:30 o'clock Sunday night
the sections were slowly moved on to
Sonora. Attempts to get food were of
little avail, for the restaurants had not
expected such a large crov^g and the lat
ter returned to the coaches in anything
but an amiable mood. At 1:15 a. m. ye 3,
terday morning the homeward Journey
was started and ended ten hours later
when, the unhappy bunch of pleasure
seekers .were landed, at. the" Santa Fe s

Constructor Evans* presence as Evans
had gone to the Bennington when thÂ«
court went there to survey the boilers
and had explained his theory of the
explosion. Ihis was denied by Evans
and the objection was overruled.
Lieutenant Victor Blue, executive offi
cer of the Bennington from August 19,
ISO 4, to the date of the explosion, was
called as a witness. He did not remem
ber accompanying the accused on in
spections. On three Sundays he said
he had made" inspections himself when
Young was sick and the latter had re
quested him to do to.
Engine room inspections, he said,
were not as a custom made at sex Blue
eaid he was not In the boiler room at
the time of an accident to one of the
boilers on the way from Honolulu to
San Diego, but he had heard there was
such an accident. Commander Young
told him of it officially late on the night
it occurred. The witness said he heard
the commander's voice in the engine
room, when Commander Young was
raising a row on the Quarter deck be
cause clothes had been left hanging on
the hatch, causing an obstruction.
Machinist's Mate O. F. Nelson, re
called, was questioned regarding the
pressure noted. After he had turned
over the engines he had noticed the
gauge registered 116 pounds. A few
minutes before the explosion 132 pounds
was registered on the auxiliary steam
gauge in the after-engine room. The
boiler and pngine room pressure, he had
observed, differ two or three pounds.
At this juncture Captain Ransom was
asked to retire as he probably will be
called as a witness.
Machinist Charles G. Wheeler recalled
and asked regarding routing for test
ing safety valves when not under
steam said he had not heard of
such a course and that when at sea
all boilers under steam -connected up,
boilers were gone over occasionally.
He further said he had set valves on
boilers C and B and afterward reset I
valve on boiler C. i

HOW HUCH OF YOUR LIFE IS
SPENT IN TRYING TO
WITHOUT GETTINfi INTO THE FIRE?
To many people the little accidents and* incidents of
daily life "turn into "Frying Pans," with exits leading into
the flames â which is 'merely another way of saying that
these people "stew" and fret and, worry over things that
happen, and in seeking "ways out," or remedies, usually
only succeed in making things worse. . ...
It requires but a small thing to put the average man
or woman on a "frying pan." The loss of a good
clerk, a good customer, a good tenant, a pocket-book,
a servantâ any one of these losses is enough; and then
ii is a case of "nerves," and irritation and fuss and
fury until relief comes.
But it is not necessary, in getting out of these' "frying
pans," to get singed and scorched and blistered. Acting-
like a derrick, a want advertisement will usually land you
free and clear of both pan and fireâ but you take some
risk in trying to leap the hurdle unassisted.
AND THE BEST PART OF IT IS THIS : THAT, AFTER
A WHILE, "THE WANT AD. HABIT." WILL EN-
TIRELY CURE YOU OF THE "FRYING PAN
HABIT," SO THAT YOU WILL NO LONGER BE-
GIN TO "STEW" OR "BOIL? WHEN SOMETHING
GOES WRONGâ BUT WILL TURN TO WANT AD-
VERTISING AS EASILY AND NATURALLY AS
YOU WOULD TURN TO A SHOE STORE FOR
SHOES, OR TO A STREET CAR TO^TAkE-YOUJ

THE SAN FRANGISCCKCALIj,; TUESDAY, ipCTOBER- 10, '1905.
COLUMBIA SHOW
IS DELIGHTFUL
Eleanor Eobson Is Charming
in Israel 'Zangwill's Odd
Play, "Merely Mary Ann"
HER WORK IS SUBTLE
She Possesses Art of the
Quality That Suggests a
â¢Haunting Tower of Genius
Zangwill may not have written a great
play in "Merely Mary Ann"â and by
much he has notâ but "Merely Mary
Ann," plus Miss Eleanor Robson, Is a
peculiarly precious something. Not hav
ing known Miss v Robson in her Frawley
days I am denied the pleasure of com
parison.
It is some eight years ago, hÂ»r moth
er told me, that , the little pig-tailed
school girl made, her flrst bow on the
stage here among us. She walked from
the school-room into * a second Ingenue
role with "the delightful cheek' of youth,"
âher mother put itâ winning immediate
recognition.
It was as an actress of international
reputation Miss Robson came back to the ,
Columbia last night. London's praise'
was without a "boo!"; and New York
took the rest of Mary Ann's smudged
cheek with the same adoring gratitude.
No need to ask why after last night,
though Miss Robson's charm Is wary
of analysis. She is the kind of person
that sets you "guessing"â guessing hard.
As Mary Ann, the London slavey. Miss
Robson is as completely convincing as
she is' completely charming, as the so
ciety young woman Mary Ann becomes
equally so.
But Misa Robson is to do .Browning's
Constance ("In a Balcony") next Thurs
day afternoon. As Juliet she wrested the
rare superlative from the William Win
ters of the craft. Yeats has yielded his
charm to her. Modern romance she first
conquered as Audrey â and one wonders
what is behind it all. In common with
these Is the poetry behind "Merely"
Mary Ann, slave of the London lodging
house, dreaming still of the birds and
bluebells of the country she came, from,
and perhaps this is the key to Mlsg Rob
son's truly exquisite art.
Mr. Zangwill's good first act is distinc
ly illuminative of the \ lodging-house
life. It is midnight. The landlady, alto
gether lovely in Ada Dwyer's , shrewd
characterization; her daughter, plump,
berlbboned, flambuoyant, are taking l their
candles from the direful hall table. They
disappear with a thousand injunctions tc
tho slavey. Here begin Miss Robson's
"yes, ma'am," "yes. sir," a whole vocab
ulary in themselves. Gradually the little
maid-servant's makeup begins to discover
itself. Gradually you feel the bravery,
tenderness, refinement, the country sweet
ness and innocence of the girl. There is
pathos as well as fun in the way in
which she helps the drunken medical stu
dent upstairs. There is delicate romance
in her every look and word for Lancelot
âLancelot, the Prince Charming of the
poor little Cinderella; Lancelot, whose
boots she cleans and to whose music she
listens. r . '- ....\u25a0".. . â¢
You don't altogether love^ Lancelot. He
is justified through Mary Ann's love, but
otherwise rather a caddish person. He is
a composer with High Ideals,, and has a'
bad case of the A. T.'sâ as Blanche Bates
calls the artistic temperament. He will
even accept the little maid-servant's in
nocent offer to go and. keep house for
him. But Mary Ann is satisfied, and such
a delightful mixture of adoration, mother
ly, sisterly, wifely, as she gives to him
in Miss Robson's variously exquisite way!
You are. almost sorry that the little idyl
is spoiled. Mary Ann ends up in a castle
of her own, and Lancelot, now a famous
composer, comes to win her there, But
Miss Robson carries, you into the' castle
with the same elusive grace that .she
gives to Mary Ann when she is "merely."
It is a portrait truly precious, haunting
and subtle as a perfume.
H. B. Warner played the Lancelot
gratefully, Ernest Manwaring a good
Peter, the popular song smith, and Mor
ten Selten a clever Brahmson, the pub
lisher. Miss Dwyer's landlady is a clas
sic bit and Margaret Fuller is almost
as good a- the daughter. The cast
throughout is good, is adequate to
Mr. Zangwill's play, and boih were thor
oughly enjoyed by the large audience.
But Miss Robson is to "Merely Mary
Ann" what Ethel Barrymore is to "Sun
day." Which is everything.

Oscar Weil Heard Him and Is Greatly
Delighted.
The violin concerto of Brahms docs not
present its composer In his most attrac
tive mood, nU indeed does it seem 'to
meâ hearing it as I did last night for the
first time and with the orchestral accom
paniment played on a pianoforte, at
thatâ to be a particularly inspiredâ or in
Â£piratingâcomposition. . Austere it is;
rather, andâ for a concerto. In which
form we look for the kind of thing that
is calculated to, establish at once a friend
ly relation with the . hearerâ forbidding.
It is Brahms In the mood that doesn't
care in the least whettier you - like him
or not, and. of the two,' would a little
rather you didn't. ' . * .
The concerto was, <however, welcome
Â£is a novelty, and the more in that it
i served to introduce to us Herr Hugo
Heermann, who, long before he had fin
ished the first movement, fully justified
his great European reputation .\,-as a
master violinist, one; of the really great
classical players, of our time.
It is an easy task to. sum up the fine
qualities in Herr Heermann's equipment:
you have but to enumeratS all those that
go to the majj^g of . a great artist. It
is a fine, fully . satisfying /tone of - great
purity: an impescable technique, (that, of
course, goes without saying), , together
with a style altogether, distinguished and
noble. . Of warmth and. poetic; quality
there is abundance: at the same time
there Is the reserve of a gentleman. Mr.
Heermann does not slop over,' even though 1
the . temptation of >' a trashy Ernest Noc
turne may be ever so great. ; In - fact,
Mr. Heermann rather \u25a0 ennobles the rub
bishy-composition In his playing of it;
lifts it, as it were," out ; of the atmosphere
of salon vapidity andâ as far as ( this As
humanly possible-rmakes it ; sound like a
really; respectable composition. '-'i >
Of the: younger -Mr. ; Heermann, Emil,
there are many good things ;to be \u25a0, said.
The ; 19-year-old ; giant ; has ,a ; fine, big,"
manly tone , (a - superb \u25a0 ; fldule) , lots i of
technique, . admirable : poise. ; and ; is one of
the ' most promising i youngsters I .;; have
ever heard. V.t There : ; is still .no sort *of
harm in his still liking to" play the showy
things; when ' one : can do what '; he did
last - night ; with the ; Chaconne, of ; Bach
one is reasonably /safe to; come^ out all
right. 4 Mr. Fred -Maurer played the piano
forte ; accompaniments -with f his (accus
tomed ; good \, taste; and ; : muslcianly* skill,
and, Indeed, made -much ; ?ofv the 'difficult
and Intricate ' Brahms score. .

good in light comedy he is bettor in his
character parts, and the 4 few glimpses

THE MOTHER AND THE LAW.
<-pHE child labor law passed by the last Legislature forbids,
I under penalty, the doing of beneficial labor by children until
*â¢ they are well up in their teens. It is also a compulsory edu
cation law and provides elaborate machinery for its enforcement.
Any ' statutory intrusion upon the family control of children needs
care in the framing, and wise discretion in the enforcement If
these are lacking great harm may be done. The attention of the
philanthropists has been j strained in the direction of child labor
and its consequences. But little attention has been given to child
idleness and its consequences. 1^ *
Part of these may be seen in the enormous increase^ of juvenile
crime and incorrigibility. The law should take into account both
sides of this great problem. It should above all open the door
of opportunity to apprenticeship in the handicrafts, under proper
regulations, as to sanitary surroundings and to secure the best
possible physical conditions. Under the present well intended
statute children reach the working age at a time when enforced
idleness is in danger of becoming habitual. In its enforcement
there should be humanity, wisdom and great care.
In the town of Alameda has occurred a case that may well at
tract attention. In that town is a widow with twelve children of her
own and six stepchildren, dependent upon her own labor for their
support. The truant officer, who has a salary of $75 per month and
appears to have also the manners of a dog catcher, has had her
arrested because one of her sons, thirteen years of age, was taken
out of school ten daj-s to substitute as a telegraph messenger for an
older brother who was ill, being threatened with consumption. She
appeared, a prisoner, in court, with a younger child so ill that it
required her constant attention.
She appeared like a woman of education and refinement who
had seen better days, though bearing traces of the hard struggle
to keep her numerous flock fed and sheltered. She said: "This
is the first time in my life that I have been in court, and it is pov
erty I cannot, avoid that brings me here. If I have violated the
law I cannot help it. I was forced to keep my son Joseph home
from school that he might take the place of his elder brother as
messenger. His earnings, while not large, were of some assistance
to me wHen I had but $1 50 in the house with which to meet the
expenses of my large household. It has been my ambition to give
every child of mine the best education I could afford. When the
iruant officer called at my , house and asked why Joseph was not at
school I explained to him the circumstances, when he said, 'Oh, you
can"t give me any talk like that. You'd better send that kid to
school or I'll have you pulled/" â¢
She was arraigned, and in the absence of her attorney, demand
ed a jury trial, the day to be set.
One reads this with mingled feelings of sympathy and respect
for the patience and courage of that lone woman, through poverty
and hardship, cherishing ideals and desiring to do a mother's duty
by her children, and of indignation at the vulgarity and -brutality of
the 575 a month truant officer. This feeling goes further. The
city superintendent of schools is reported in an interview as saying :
"My investigation satisfies me that she did not exert herself to
comply with the law and send her son to school. I think we can
make it out in court that she has flagrantly violated the law."
The dog catcher truant officer and the smug superintendent do j
not seem to have thought what they would do, put in that mother's
place, to keep the wolf from the door behind which is a family of
that size dependent on her for all it eats and wears. Judged by their
reported expressions they would run from the unequal fight in a
day. What high-spirited and well-salaried officials they are ! Ala
meda should look into their cases. Perhaps their zeal for the law
should be better paid. If they get a jury of their kind the powerful
commonwealth of California will win a great victory over a mother
of twelve children, the head of a family of eighteen. If convicted
the law requires that she be fined and jailed, for does not the school
superintendent say that her crime is flagrant?
She did not "exert herself," with two children sick and all de
pendent, to comply with the law! There is a higher law than the
statutes of the State: it says, "love thy neighbor; do unto others
2s you would have them do unto you ; deal justly, love mercy, re
member the poor: judge not lest ye be judged; remember the
widow and the orphan."
According to that high law the mother of twelve, instead of
being dragged to court a prisoner, should be honored in the town.
The burden she bears is for society and the State. She is struggling
to rear her large brood to respectable citizenship, and into her iso
lation and upon the scene of her trial and struggle the only utter
.ance of society is the hoarse slang of the officer, "Send that kid to
school or I'll have you pulled."
CASSIE CHADWICK AGES.
TT is considered important as news that Mrs. Chadwick, in jail in
I Cleveland for frenzied female financiering, has aged and lost all
but her nerve. The only trouble with Cassie is that her case
came out too soon. If she. could have floated her credit until the
Equitable Life affair was sprung, and John A. McCall testified before
the committee, she would have seemed by comparison a sound and
safe financier. When one reflects what was missed by her failing to
negotiate with the great insurance companies of New York there is
a sense of loss to the world of something supergrand in finance.
She found country bankers easy, but they were close-fisted and care
ful, compared with the insurance companies, which had millions to
put into any kind of engraved or even lithographed paper securities.
She has moved for a new trial, and on many grounds she should
have it. It is a mean thing to punish a woman while men who did
as bad cr worse are living in country seats and keep a butler and
coachman. She has contracted consumption in jail, while her male
companions in torrid finance are touring Europe and contracting
piles of brac-a-brac and the works of the Old Masters.
The time may come when Cleveland will hold her up as a con
servative operator in her line, by way of contrast to the wild and
runaway plungers of New York City. ; Â«
So rapidly do sensations and events follow each other that peo
ple who see her name in print now will ask, "Who is Cassie Chad
wick?" But country bankers are not among them. At that name
they chill, and even the close air of the "sweat room" grows cold.
The limelight shines for others now, and she is pining away in a dun
geon, waiting for death or a new trial to save her from the peni-

THE BELTED BOLERO.
THE bolero, which seems to have been made a permanent place in fash
ions for itself on both this and the other side of the water. Is shown
in several different forms this season, this model being of. the belted" va
riety. Three deep pleats on either side of the front and the back are held
down to the waistline by a trim belt of black satin, the material of the jacket
being a satiny black broadcloth. The vest Is. of white, broadcloth, with
many rows of machine stitching in black, and the black satin is repeated
In the roll collar and high cuffs. Buttons of white broadcloth appear down
each side of the front, and buttonholes are simulated by loops of black
soutache braid. The hat is one of those extremely Frenchy shapes, high in
the back and narrowing down to almost nothing in the front. The cache
peigne is banked with roses and foliage, and broad velvet ribbon is drawn
around the crown and finished with a medium-sized bow in front.

MEET TROUBLE BRAVELY.
ANGELA MORGAN.
ONE â¢ of the secrets of power lies
in learning to adjust oneself as
speedily and cheerfully as possible
to disappointment, trial, heartache, pain.
We can never know strength until we
have met sorrow face to face, have gazed
unflinchingly into the eyes of pain and
have clasped hai.us with grief.
The more fearlessly, the 'more readily
we meet sorrow, .the -sooner our release.
The braver our gaze, the stronger our
touch, the more unshrinking our attitude,
the sooner shall we know peace and
power.
It is while we are resisting, rebelling,
expostulating with fate tnat we feel our
keenest anguish. It is because we stub
bornly refuse to be reconciled that we
suffer torture.
Peace and relief come only with the
resolute acceptance of the inevitable and
willingness to take the lesson pain has
for us.
How rarely we find such acceptance
possible! How bitterly we cry and plead
that we be spared the suffering. How
we wrestle with the fates, struggling to
escape our discipline! -.
We are like rebellious children, that
will not yield to the parental command.
Resisting, sobbing, clutching some for
bidden treasure, we fight and plead that
we may have our own will. Yet some
day every one of us must encounter
pain; we must know the necessity of keen
self-sacrifice; we must give up our will
to the will of a higher. And if we are
brave, If we do not shrink, we are shown
the great lesson pain has for us.
We are all anxious for power. We all
want to develop the best in us. Then,
why do we persistently resist the agencies
throu gh which strength and development
are to reach us? Why do we strive to
push away the hand that offers us the
gifts we desire?

That is what we do when we seek,
with our puny strength, to thruat dis
cipline from us. We do cot see that we
cannot bug to us a forbidden happiness
without losing -the flne soul qualities we
would gain, without postponing the de
velopment and the strength we have, at
our highest moments, desired.
Try as we will to make ourselves be
lieve it is tuggedness of character we
really want, when the test 'comes we are
unwilling to meet it. We would cling to
a selfish happiness at the sacrifice of the
sturdy tralta that make up the character
beautiful.
And we shrink from sacrifice. We
would ward off the blow of unhappinesa
just as long as we can. We hate the
lessons of anguish. We run from pain
and hide our eyes from disappointment.
But some day. some time, we must all
learn control; we must gain the mastery.
We may seek to postpone the day; we
may entreat heaven to spare us. We
may question and Implore.
Such expostulation is sheer waste of
time and .of spiritual strength. The
sooner we gather our forces, after the
blow, the sooner we smile and go cheer
fully on cur way. the more quickly will
peace come.
The longer we rebel, the farther do we
push peace and future 'happiness from
us. By our willful resistance we post
pone the poise and the power ne would
gain.
If you must meet heartache and dis
appointment, be brave. Reach willing
hands to sorrow and her touch will give
you peace. Browning says:
"If I stoop
Into a dark, tremendous seaÂ» of cloud.
It Is but for a time; I press God" 3 larap

I long at night for a decent fight.
My birthright the battleground!
And I sigh all day la a pitiful way
For a chance to go nosing round. '
Why they've caged me so I never shall

But I'm growing lazy and fat.
While I sit and mourn that I was net
born
A common old back-yard eat.
Oh. the Joy, to go sorambltng la stray
ash cans
To wander at will away,
To forage and fight and yowl by night.
And be king of the fence by day.
For this would I sell every comfort X
own.

THE SAN: FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 10, : 1905!
HENRY T. SCOT
NOW PRESIDENT
Moore Kesigns Office With
Pacific Mutual Company
and Successor Is Named
HAS A : LONG-- 'RECORD
Eetiring Underwriter the
Executive, of the Concern
for Twenty-Eight ' Years
After more than twenty-eight years
of service with the Pacific Lifo
Insurance Company George A. Moore,
the president of the company,
yesterday, carried out his inten
tion, which was announced to
to the directors some time ago, .to re
tire and abandon the responsibilities
and hard work that belong to the posi
tion he gave up. A regular .meeting
of the board of directors was held
yesterday, the principal business of
which was to consider the resignation
of Mr. Moore and the election of his
successor. Henry T. Scott was the man
named. ?P\'-Â«Â£
Mr. Moore, explained In detail his rea
sons for resigning. He was proud to
Say that the affairs of the Pacific
Mutual ' Life Insurance Company had
been conscientiously administered in
the best interests of all concerned, and
that he was fully assured this would
continue to be the case, and that the
same safe and conservative business
methods that have characterized , the
past of the company would characterize
its future. He extended a warm wel
come to Mr. Scott, his successor, say
ing that" he was widely known as the
builder of the -famous United States
battleship Oregon, and that he was a
gentleman of unquestioned Integrity
and ability.
' "I am assured," said Mr. 4 Moore to
the directors, "that ' you will give to
President Scott the same loyal and en
thusiastic support that has .. been so
helpful to me, and which is so essential
to the success of the company." He also
announced that all other officers and
the heads of departments of the com
pany will remain as heretofore.
I Mr. Moore addressed the directors In
formally, and made a general state
ment which was In part as follows:
I have been connected with the Pacific Mu
tual Life Insurance Company since early in
1577. a period of more than twenty-eight years,
and for twenty-five years successively I have
had the honor to be elected Its president. It
has been my privilege to see the company and j
its business expand from that of a purely lo
cal organization â its business almost . entirely
confined to one State â into an organization
favorably known throughout our entire country,
with established agencies in forty-two States,
and Territories thereof, and with a reputation
for conservative management, fair dealing,
prompt payment of claims, and a careful and
judicious handling of policy holders' funds and
investments second to no company in the
world.
In retiring from the company my regret is at
the severance of the long and pleasant relations
that -I have enjoyed with the members of our
board of directors, with my associate offloers
and home office employes, and with the general
agents and field force. ' -
The company is in splendid condition; its
business and assets rapidly increasing. It is
well officered, and has substantially the same
reponslble and capable board of directors thai
have so lons and Â»o successfully conducted ita
affairs, and it is because of this that I at
this time feel Justified t in carrying into effect
personal plans that I have Â«ntertained for sev
eral years past, and resigning my connection
with the company, feeling that having: passed
my seventy-first year I am entitled to relief
from the aares and responsibilities of the posi
tion I have so lon* occupied.
In addition to resigning: the position
of president Mr. Moore also resigned
from the board of directors. Dr. W. R.
Cluness also resigned as director, and
p. G. Drum and G. H. Umbsen were
elected directors to fill the two vacan
cies in the board. At the meeting of
the - directors many regrets were ex
pressed at Mr. Moore's decision to re
tire. He has been^ one of the" ablest
and most successf ul N underwriters on
the Pacific Coast and the success of
the Pacific Mutual Life Insuraifce com
pany has been very largely due to his
personal efforts and ability.
Henry T. Scott, the newly elected
president of the Pacific Mutual Life In
surance Company, said last evening
that the resignation of Mr. Moore was
accepted by the directors with great
regret. Mr. Scott also said that he was
greatly pleased that. Mr. Moore had
agreed, at the request of the directors,
to occupy an office on the executive
floor of the Pacific Mutual Life Insur
ance Company's building, which will
enable him to be In constant touch with
Insurance problems as they arise.

The Rev. Dr. Francis M.\ Larkin _\u0084 read
a paper on "Church Music and [ the New ,
Hymnal" before the meeting. Among oth-!
er th*ings he said : . '=. \u25a0
! Music Is peculiarly a product of Christianity.
Atheism never sings. Unbelief haÃ no hymn-
Cdy: even a moribund religion is always mute.
Christianity has produced over 400,000 hymns
in 200 languages. Our faith sings, hope sings,
love sings.. U:.. f . .\u25a0- ." â¢'
Did you ever see a lover that did not want to
sing? If you ever do, pass him by. hÂ«'Â« not
genuine. : - , -
: The publication of the new hymnal is another
step in the progress of the two methoUUms,
the Methodist Eiiiscopal Church and the Meth
odist Episcopal Church South, toward Â«ssen
tial unity. The influence of the use of this
hymnal in both thÂ« churches means more
than appears upon the surface.
The Rev. George C. Adams, D. D., pas
tor of the First Congregational Church,
spoke before the Presbyterian Ministers'
Union at 920 Sacramento street' yesterday
on the action of the American board in \u25a0
regard to J. D. Rockefeller's contribu
tions. He said in part:
The press has ' said much about tainted
money. A year ago the son Of John D. RockÂ«
feller asked the \u25a0 secretary. Dr. Barton, if the
American board called at hla father's office
to see his representatives.
These gentlemen had prepared a map of the
world in the most businesslike manner which
represented the dark spots where Christianity
had not been planted.
Strange. to say, about that time Mrs. Wheel-,
er and a little missionary band in Turkey were
praying that some rich man's heart might be
touched so that the work there might b.-
advanced, when God answered the prayer. Ht
touched the heart of Rockefeller, who strange
ly enough placed his finger on thÂ« spot repre
senting- Turkey when the map was submitted
and provided $55,000 for the work. He gave
altogether $100,000. which could not have been
returned had the board desired to do so.
As soon as the gift was announced some
Christian ministers began protesting and criti
cized the board's conduct for accepting it.
Those who protested had free recourse to the
dally Dress. The religious press followed up
and said all it wished to say. -
The presH does not settle these questions, but
those c!o who unqualifiedly sustain the Ameri
can board by a majority vote. ;-
The principal thing the editors looked for at
the American board convention in Seattle was
a big tight. Consequently there was a crowded
house all the time.
Dr. Gladden became the champion of those
who opposed the acceptance of the gift. He
gave the press the very text of the resolution
that he was going to bring before the board
thirty days previous to the Seattle meeting. â¢
In this matter of condemnation we have got
to have some proof; we have, got to be as
Christian ac the courts. Gladden is a noble
man ; all love him, but h-e has got this matter
right into him and he can't see anything else.
If any one asks if money received is taint
ed I cannot tell, but I have, the impression
that God puts it into the hearts of CarnÂ«gie
and Rockefeller, to unload, though they may
get their money by methods we as Christiana
can't uphold. ' "When young Rockefeller- was
asked by a secretary. of a Young Men's Chris
tian Association for money for the associa
tion he said his father had already given $150,
000, a fact that no one knew anythine about.
He is unloading all the time.
Ministers ' of - the different evangelical
churphes will meet every "Vv'ednesday aft
ernon from 1:30 to 2:30 o'Qlock for prayer
and conference in reference' to the re
ligious interests of the city. The first
meeting will take place to-morrow at the
First Congregational Church, when Dr.
George W. White of 'the Central Metho
dist Episcopal Church will lead j the ser
vice. While this is a. special meeting of
pastors, the laity will be welcomed.
FOSTER STILL RUNNING
CALIFORNIA NORTHWESTERN
Prenldent of Road Emphatically Denies
1 Rumor* That Sout hern Pacific Is
to Take Control Soon.
Rumors are again being persistently,
circulated that the California North
western Railroad and the North Shore
road are soon to be turned over to the
control of the officials of the Southern
Pacific Company. Yesterday the rumor
was stronger ; than ever, but was em
phatically denied, by both President A.
W. Foster and' Manager James Agler.
When seen last night President Poster
said: â¢
"There is 'absolutely nothing In these
stories. If any' immediate changes
were contemplated I am sure I would
know.. I am tired of theso. stories that
are continually flying around. The two
roads will run as they are for the pres
ent."' -:T j ;'/ ,' r \u25a0 : ' : ' \u25a0â¢\u25a0 ",-''" ' - '<\u25a0 '
At the Southern .Pacific Company's
offices the story was also denied. One
official suggested that the latest rumor,
probably originated in the fact that
the California Northwestern officials
'several. days ago requested the South
ern Pacific officials to furnish them
with a few personal record blanks/
which employe^ are. in the habit of fill
ing out ' and submitting to their su
periors. 1 The .fact: that those blanks,
bearing the name of the Southern Pa
cific, were seen about the" offices vof the
California Northwestern and: the North
Shore roads probably aroused the sus
picion, of certain employes that the two
roads "were about/to pas^ tp the direct
control of \the. Southern:, Pacific.

It now looks as if there would be no
changes among the officials at either
Oakland track or Ascot Park for the com
ing season. J. Myrick Jr.. or "Cy," as
he is more familiarly known, treasurer
of and a director in the Los Angeles
Jockey Club, paid this city a visit last
week, and he stated that his association
contemplated re-engaging its old staff.
Colonel Hamilton again presides, with Ed
Cole of New York as associate judge. P.
P. Pomeroy will be clerk of the ecales
and Ed Jasper racing secretary and
bandicappÂ«r. Richard Dwyer and Jake
Holtman are the alternating starters.
George Rose, the bookmaker and the
"man behind" at Ascot Park, is due to
arrive at Los Angeles next Saturday.
Thomas H. Williams,, president of the
JCew California Jockey Club, reaches
tome to-day from Mexiao.
"Smithy," the tall Chicago plunger, who
wes connected with the M. D. Miller en
terprises last season, is here again.
The car containing the second division
cf Jack Keene'e stable pulled into Oak
land yesterday. Radtke, the jockey, came
along with this lot.
J. W. Blaylock's string of horses from
Canada also arrived at Oakland yester
day. With this latter consignment came
Black Art and Charlatan, the property of
Walter Gum.
OCCIDENTAL CLUB TAKES
HAND IN FIGHTING GAME
Llkelr Looking: Card Is on the Board*
for Thursday \lrlii at Wood
ward's Pavilion.
The eyes of the fight fans are now
focused on the amateur show to be given
at Woodward's Pavilion under the aus
pices of the Occidental Club next Thurs
day night. These will be the first con-,
tests held by the new club and the
match-maker has secured eighj pairs of
the best boys now boxing in the amateur
ranks. Three !?j>ecial events have been
carded for the middle-weight, welter
weight and bantam-weight champion
ehips. Jack McLaughlin, the shifty Eng
lish middle-weight who ha* been trimming
all the candidates with apparent ease,
will have a hard proposition In James
McClair. the husky Olympic Club scrap
per, who has been under DeWitt Van
Court's watchful eye for the past few
months. The veteran boxing instructor
of the Post street club considers Mc-
Clair a comer and expects him to floor
the Britisher long before the fourth round
looms up.
The two lads, who hook up for the
welter- weight belt, have long established
reputations for aggressive milling and
some hard slugging should be the re
sult of their encounter. Willie Wolf,
the present holder of the title, is a much
more scientific boater than George Ellis,
his opponent, but the latter has the wal
lop. The two bantams who will peck
away for four rounds are Harry Williams
and Harry Baker and it is a toss-up who
\u25a0will be returned the winner. Five other
high-class bouts round out an exception
ally fine looking card. Phil Wand will
act as referee.
COFFROTH SAVES FILMS
FROM HANDS OF RECEIVER
Files Bond to Secure Battling- Nelson
Against Any Loss He May
Sustain.
By filing a bond for $15,000 to cover all
loss Battling Nelson may sustain, James
"VT. Coffroth, James E. Britt and other
members of the Moto Photo Company
have kept the films of thÂ« Nelson-Britt
prize fight at Coima out of the hands
of a receiver. Yesterday morning Judge
Seawell decided the suit Instituted by
Attorneys Samuel 1L Shortridge, Charles
SI. Shortrldffe and Louis P. Boardman cm
behalf of Nelson. The court held that
"Nelson was entitled to a receiver pend
ing the determination of his suit for a
decree to the effect that he Is entitled
t6 a one-third Interest in the films and
one-third of the income to date.
Shortly after the decision was handed
down Judge Seawell appointed Marius
J. Kast, a member of the Cosmos Club,
to act as receiver, fixing his bond at
$10,000. The bond was filed in the after
noon, but before he could take posses
sion of tbe films Coffroth's attorney filed
notice of appeal. The hearing then pro
ceeded before Judge Seawell as to the
amount of the bond that should be re
quired of the defendants. Coffroth testi
fied that up to date the films had taken
in about $12,500 and it was expected that
about $4500 more would be taken In in this
State. Judge Beaweil fixed the amount
of the bond at $15,000 and It was filed,
Herbert Choynskl and B. E. Xathanson
signing as sureties.

WASHINGTON Oct. 9. â President
Roosevelt entertained at luncheon to-day
Dr. N. *H. Nichols and W. T. Reid of
Harvard, Arthur T. Hillebrand, the
famous Pittsburg pitcher, and ' John' B.
Fine 1 of Princeton and Walter' Camp ; and
Mr. Owsley of Yale. The six guests/bf
the President constitute the athletic ad
visers of the respective i colleges 5 named.
The President desired to consider v wlth
them particularly the morale of the game
of footbair with a view of eliminating
much of ita brutality If possible.
A general discussion of college athletes
was had, but talk- centered around the
game of football. It. is hoped by the
President that with the co-operation of
the college authorities and the athletic
advisers the rules, of the game may be
so amended as practically to do away
with much of the brutality which makes
the sport objectionable to many people.
It , is understood that no definite con
clusions were reached, Indeed none was
expected, the idea of the President being
simply to start the ball rolling in the
direction of a modification of the rules
of the game.

MATTHEASON MOWS
THE PHILLIES DOWN
Only Four Men Hit
; Great Pitcher i'
, Safely,
New Yorkers Get to
: Plank for Ten
n Safeties.
PHILADELPHIA, \u25a0 Oct. 8.â Masterly
pitching by Christy Matthewson, backed
up â¢ by . gilt-edged playing by tho men be
hind him, . gave; the New -York : National
League champions a victory to-day over
the Philadelphia American" League pen-*
nant ; winners in the â¢ first of the series
of * seven " games*.' for \u25a0' the world's cham
pionship. ". Philadelphia failed to score,
Matthewson allowing the home team only
four hits, while the New Yorkers man
aged to : score three runs off Plank. Al
though ; defeated, Philadelphia played a
brilliant game.
New York's great pitcher mowed down
the I "' home players In almost one, : ( two,
three * order. Of the ' thirty-one men 'who
faced him only eight reached flret, four
of them on hits, three on fielders' choices
and one on Donlin's muff of a short fly.
Only one man, SchrecK, reached third,
and. he was thrown -out at the plate on
a close play. , . \ â¢
New York also excelled in base running,
four of the visitors being credited with
stolen bases. The, only department
wherein the Philadelphia club outshone
the New ' Yorkers was in Heading. They
gave Plank as brilliant support as has
been seen here for a long time. Monte
Cross at short and Captain Lave Cross
at third made - come phenomenal stops
and quick throws while on the run. The
team played without an 'error.
For New York Dahlen and Devlin were
all over the infield, the latter making
several hard stops and throws. Donlin
made New York's only misplay. Hej
started late on a short fly ball and
muffed it. It: resulted in nothing, as the
runner was doubled up at second on the
next play. .
Matthewson singled to center in' the
fifth inning; but was forced at* second
by Bresnahan, who stole second. Browne
was an easy out, but Bresnahan scored
on Donlin's single to left field. McQann
was purpoc.ly sent to first on four balls.
Mertes" hit to the center . field crowd,
scoring Doulln with New York's second
run. Dahlen was an easy out The visitors
scored their third run in the â¢ ninth on
Gilbert's third hit of the day, Matthew
son's sacrifice and Bresnahan's single. .
The nearest PhiladeApnia came . to scor
ing was in the sixth inning, which
Bchreck opened with a beautiful drive
for two bases. He reached third" on
Plank's Bacriflce, but was thrown out at
the plate by Matthewson, who gathered
in Hartzell's sharp grounder.
While the interest in the series is wide
spread, the crowd was not as large as
that which saw any one of the three
games between the home team and Chi
cago when they "played .their series about
ten : days ago for first, place. Score:. -

OCEANIC COMPANY'S ' STEAMPHf P RETURNS FROM SOUTH SEAS
Brings- Deserting
Whalers From
Tahiti
Coptic Has Stormy
Voyage From
Honolulu
Pie Oceanic Steamship Company's
r Mariposa, Captain Lawless, ar
rived yesterday rrora Tahiti. She
kicked off one blade of her propeller
at Jl:40 p. m., September 30, but, in
spite of the loss, reached port on sched
ule time. Like the Alameda. the Mari
posa is famous for her punctuality, and
it takes more than the loss of a pro
peller blade to get her out of the habit.
For the last forty-eight hours of the
voyage she bucked a northeaster and
had to slow down to nine knots.
In spite of the wintry finish the pas
sengers, who made the round trip for
pleasure, enjoyed the voyage and came
home enthusiastic over the delights of
the south seas and the comforts of the
Mariposa.
Three more runaway whalers were
brought home on the Mariposa. E. A.
Connors and Paul Knudsen deserted
at Papeete from the Alice Knowles, and
Richard Ladoig took French leave from
the Charles YV. Morgan. The men say
they were ill-fed and abused on the
blubber hunters, and when the oppor
tunity offered they ran away and ap
pealed to the American Consul at Pa
peete for a. passage home.
Among the passengers were Mr. and
Mrs. Ralph Klrkham Blair, who have
been away on a honeymoon trip and
\u25a0who recommend the trip to Tahiti to
all brides and grooms.
Among the passengers on the Mari
popa were:

Liner Coptic Arrives.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany's liner Coptic, Captain Finch, arrived yes
terday from the Orient. She came in later
than expected, having been held back on the
run from Honolulu by strong northerly gales,
the brought 250S tons of cargo and the usual
number of parsensrers.
Among the passengers was P. D. Cheshire,
who was appointed American Consul at Muk
den, but who never reached his post on ac
count of the war. When Consul General Mc-
Wade was removed from Canton Cheshire was
ordered there as acting Consul. He expects to
return to the Orient in a month or so and
mo to Mukden to take the post to which he
was originally appointed.
Another passenger was O. P. Austin, who
has been traveling around the world gathering
statistics for .the Department of Commerce
and Labor. He !s accompanied by his wife.
The other passengers included business men,
tourists, insular employes from the Philippines
and a rÂ«w missionaries, just enough of the
istter to account, as far as the Coptic's
failors were concerned, for the head winds
and high seas encountered after leaving Hono
lulu.
Tfce Coptic missed two typhoons. In one
of the typhoons the Empress of Japan was
somewhat damaged. The passengers on the
Canadian Pacific liner are said to have suf
fpred greatly in the storm, which It is said
ctuid hsvebeen avoided, had the captain of
the Empress used as good Judgment as -was
shown by the masters of the other . vessels,
who managed to avoid the conflict with the
elements.

V OMAHA, Neb., ,; Oct. , 9.-Pat Crowe,
shackled to Detective Heitfeldt of .â¢ the
Omaha detective department, and ac
companied by Chief Detective Dunne, ar
rived in Omaha to-night from " Butte,
Mont., where he was arrested a week
ago. A crowd of 2000 persons "had gath
ered at the Union Station and they filled
the station "and approaches in every | di
rection,* intent' on securing a glimpse of
Crowe.
A large cordon of police opened an aisle
from the platform of the train to a patrol
wagon- in the f rear : of the g station, and
Crowe, \u25a0'.: between the" two detectives .with
a patrolman walking ahead and another
behind, was marched to the wagon r amid
the cheers of some and exclamations of
others^ , The' extraordinary precaution
taken by the police department for; land
ing Crowe safely behind the bars seemed
hardly necessa; y , f or ."> he apparently; had
no :wlsh to escape.
A, large crowd- followed the patrol
wagon to the station," where another
crowd had gathered to witness the return
of the .prisoner/ who was fj hurried ; into
the captain's | office, where he was:regis
tered.- Opposite his name was placed the
charge of- shooting. with 'intent ; to kill or
wound. \u25a0-'.'..'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 '-:\u25a0'' '.v "\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢ >â¢"-.' * ; '- ; - \u25a0' .
Crowe was' not .inclined .to talk of his
past and refused absolutely: to speak of
his " connection with the kidnaping of
Eddie Cudahy. He ; declared that much
had Â£ been published of his I doings, con
fessions and : other ; matters which were
without - foundation. ; Among " these he
mentioned a confession said to have been
signed by him at Butte implicating young
Cudahy in a conspiracy In connection
with the kidnaping.
"When this case comes to trial," said
Crowe, "the truth' will gÂ» to the world.
Gcd will take care of me ;; he takes ; care
of everybody . and . makes no , mistakes. I
do not ; feel nearly so anxious about "se
curing my liberty again as I do to reform
and get back to ian honest life. I once
did well in Omaha; and, if, given a chance
I believe I can do" as well again." ,
"Is It true that you once offered: to re
turn $21,000 to Edward A. Cudahy if he
would not prosecute you 7*' was asked.
*r "l'. ! believe Mr.; Cudahy has ;majde the
statement that I did so. I do not think
he would tell a lie'for $21,000,",. he replied.
Crowe's personal "appearance is .any
thing but that of a criminal. He was
smoothly shaved, wbre % a stylish suit of
clothes, ~' with patent leather shoes and
other articles to match. Except : for his
white hair he does not look to be 36
years old, which -he says is his correct

EAGERLY AWAIT
ST. PAUL'S DOOM
Expectant Crowd .Builds a
â¢Tented City Near); Kocks
Where Steamer Is Wrecked
iHOLDS LONELY VIGIL
Sole Occupant of Stranded
Vessel Is Horse Impaled
There by the Elements
The steamer Corona, which arrived here
yesterday from Eureka, brought the of
ficers, crew and passengers of the ill-fated
St. Paul, - who had been carried up to
Eureka by the schooner Vanguard. Only
Captain 'â¢ Randall and two \u0084 sailors were
left ; behind; and they are, now on the
beach where. the St. Paul stranded, being
there to guard the interests of the own
ers of the vessel/
Seas are now thundering over the St.
Paul from stem to stern. The only living
creature, now on the- ship is [ Luther F.
Williamson's beautiful horse. The poor
animal was left behind because there was
no" possible way _ to get him off.
As the Corona .passed the wrecked ship
last night it was plain to all the passen
gers "who saw her I that unless the weath
er moderated very soon the vessel must
become a total loss. Huge waves were
striking her with tremendous I fury and
the seas were running so high that It was
impossible for any one to land on her
from a small boat. ' .
The beach- Is only: about 300 yards dis
tant, .and here are encamped in tents
about 500 human buzzards waiting for the
big ship to break in two in the hopes that
her: valuable cargo would wash ashore.
They ; will, however, have a hard time to
obtain possession of any of the merchan
dise, as Captain Randall and his men are
heavily armed and prepared to stand off
any looting. . : . "
Chief Officer E. W. Mason in speaking
of the stranding of the St. Paul said:
I was asleep when we ran on the rocks and
toot course can say nothing as to the causes
which led to the wrecking or the steamer, we
struck the rocks with a crash. It waa only
a second before - 1 i was .on deck- The night
v)a.s dark and a dense .mist was falling-. . Wa
soon had the boats lowered and sent away all
the passengers ' that wanted to go.
Several preferred to remain on the big ship,
rather than take chances In thÂ« life boats In
such a nasty sea. The first lot of passengers
got away at 2 o'clock. . \u25a0
Those leit on board dld-not leave, the strand
ed vessel until about 5 o'clock In the after
noon. . The captain and those of his officers
whu were left on the ehto were the last to
leave. About noon we sent a llnÂ« ashore,
which was made ' fast ' to a log en the beach,
while the other end was attached to the main
mast of the -St. Paul. On. this we rigged a
pulley â¢to which we attached a chair. We
did, this In case of emergency. In the mean
time we began firing our cannon, and kept /up
blowing a fog horn. About 3 o'clock we couM
hear the sound of a steamer's whistle, but we
could not see her on account of the dense mist
and I fog banging low off the coast. We con
tinued the firing of the cannon with renewed
vigor. . Some of the passengers shouted. -The
wind had been rising alt day. and now the sea
was beginning \u25a0to wash 'up ont o the decks.
The hold of the ship was full of water. We
could still tear the steamer's whistle, now
near, and - now . far ' ctft. -
; The fog was settling down! upon us, heavier
and heavier every minute. We were almost
giving. up hope that our preserver so near to
us might not be ablÂ« to help us. We were
about deciding to begin sending passengers and
crew "ashore on the rope when the Vanguard
slowly .* crept toward through, t the : fog, and
dropped anchor about an- eighth of a milÂ« dis
tant. It was then .5 o'clock, night- was fall-
Ing and a roach sea running. Waves were
washing almost over the upper, decks. We
loaded our own I boats first, and then the Van
guard- sent her boats alongside and we loaded
them. ' Before we took a final leave of the
ship , tv e led < Williamson's burse, out of his
stall, and tried to : make htm Jump overboard,
but the poor beast was so terrified at the
crashing waves that he refused to move.
, We had to leave him there. . He cried and
whinnied and seemed to fully realize the plight
he was In. As soon as we boarded the Van
guard she headed for Eureka, where we ar
rived \u25a0 without further Incident. Last Sat
urday, Captain Randall and a picked crew went
down to the St. Paul, and succeeded In landing
on her, after a struggle. | . They reported when
they returned to .Eureka that ? about three
quarters of the cargo was under water. They
said that - Williamson's horse was . still there
wandering about ' the ship, moaning and cry
ing. They filled buckets of water for him, but
he was 'so terrified he could : not ' drink. * They
then rolled out a bale of hay and opened It yp
so that he could eat at will. Captain Randall
said ilt would be utterly useless under the
present weather to put a -lighter alongside to
take the horse off. No barge could live. In
such a sea. The beach Is now a tented city.
There are about 500 people- camping there wait
ing ' for * the St: Paul , to go to pieces. When
she does they hope to get hold of some of her
cargo that is bound .to \u25a0 wash ashore. They
will have their trouble for their pains, as Cap
tain Randall and his men are heavily armed,
and ' will ' resent : any attempt on the \u25a0 part , of
the ' human buzzards . to make away with any
portion of the ' cargo. The only possible â¢ hope
for. saving the ; movables of. the vessel la the
fmmedlate moderating of the" weather. Captain
Randall will remain there until the ship goes
to * pieces, or \u25a0 until he receives further orders
from the, company. -:

"I have been a very active and a very busy
woman. I have had plenty to do. but as lons
as I was well my work was a pleasure- to me.
I have been married nine years and have flyÂ«
children. Mothers know Â» what the care of
young children means. My stomach seemed to
give way : first, though I had suffered - wits
catarrh for a long time. I bad a constant pain
In the pit of my stomach and finally a lump
began to Trow. It was the beginning of a
tumor, my doctor told me, and probably was
cancerous. Medicines had no effect upon thÂ«
pain and no effect upon the lump, so I took up
the Electro-Chemle treatment. Electro-Chem-
istry helped me at once, and It only took three
months at a very little expense to' complete
my cure. My name la Mrs. H. Bloom, My
home is at 10SS Sixty-seventh St., Oakland.
and It will always be a pleasure and I believ*
! a duty to recommend the Electro-Cfaemio
treatment."

Xevr York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 9.â The market went
through a course of moderate liquidation to
tiay, induced by the growing belief that money
will hold firm for a considerable period of time.
The liquidation was not urgent at any time
and was not continuous. The tone of the mar
ktt was resilient in the face of the selling and
there were gooi recoveries, out there was a
r.arked decline in acti\-Uy when prices were
moving upward and the principal trading of
the day was do3e_jcn._a .descending: scale of i
prices. The conditions disclosed by the Satur- <
<lay bank statement were the immediate mo- I
lives for the selling, the low level of the sur
plus cad the continuant* or factors of deple
tion of oaeh reserves *erv:np as an admonition
to contract outstanding obligations. ' Loans
were eni'.ed on a moderate Ecale and there was
seme voluntary paying- oft- or borrowings madÂ«
at last week's high money rates. Seme vol
untary \u25a0 liquidation of stocks accompanied this
process. apj*arently induced by the conviction
that Epeculative activity in the immediate fu
ture is l:kt !y to decline, leaving less favor
sble opportunities for conducting liquidation.
It is this sentiment which . crows almost ln
*vitably in a dull market that makes doubtful
the ability of protective measures In the mar
ket to hold prices. Up to this time, however,
the protection of the maraet has been facill-'
t&ted by the widespread conx-ictlon that an
advance, in prices ultimately' is to come. The
policy of opposing -reaction throusrb the period
of monetary strain has come into question,
however." Criticisms of the attempt* to main
tain an crtlficial ease in tae money market are
having- an influence. Financial authorities in
London are reported as representing fears of
a raid on the London market on behalf. of the
maintenance,, of ! the speculative situation in
New York, -which would, threaten unfavorable
consequences to the London situation. Re
jiorts ti-cre again current to-day of further
engagements of gold in London, but they were
not confirmed. Opinion in London leans to
ward the probability of an adx-ance in the bank
rate thie week on account of the -feeling preva
lent there. There \u25a0 were further large -.with
drawals of gold from London for Egypt and
<Hscount9 advanced both in Paris and Berlin.
There was no appreciable change in the ex
change rate in this market. The call money
market showed some relaxation from the ten- '.
sion of the latter part of last week, due no
doubt to the liquidation of stocks. Out of
town institutions also continued to offer funds
here quite freely. Preparations are expected,
however, before the end of the week for next
Monday's payment on Japan loan subscrip
tions, which will call for upward of $30,000,000.
The time money market -was -called firm with
an .advancing tendency. Very great activity
was further reported in a!! kinds of buelne's
throughout the country, reports from railroad
traffic officials eervlng aa the special . feature
for Monday. This evidence of the profitable
u*e "or money in all kinds of business at a
rata> rising above that returned at the cur
rent average level of prices of securities â¢ Is
an inducement for the liquidation of securi
ties and the use of funds in other fields. Prices
reeoverd a good part of their losses when the'
money rate ran off late m the - day- and the
market then became torpid.
Bonds were easy. Total eales, par value,
$2,643,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

up remarkably ' well,;considering\ the wave \u25a0 of
pessimism. which appears to be" now sweeping
over, the â trade ' from"; the :very> disappointing
action .of the' market the' past - three -weeks
and the collapse of bull pools." This has been
incriassd by the heavy; movement , of - the crop
and the late â¢' reluctance \u25a0â¢ to crop '\u25a0 ideas of over
11,000,000 bales f.nd -the continued- success of
the bears. "The different Wall street and South
ern pools appear ; now., to â¢ ha\'Â« . thrown -over
their : deckload '-- and to '=' have \u25a0 further \u25a0 reduced
their speculative* holdings to such' an ' extent
that "there, is not: now much- weak- long stuff
hanging over the -market..' This greatly- im
proved the - technical ; speculative position.'- to
gether, with .the factl that the cotton 7 options
here for, October.' November and December de
liveries are , actually below ' the 'Current \u25a0 prices
quoted 'for spot cotton at the principal South

it costs one-half to three-quarters of .a cent to

The newest thing in the jag line is the
brick-throwing jag. Judge ' Mogan had
a specimen, of. this breed yesterday. His
name was August Gustavsen and be
claims tÂ«* have been a friend of Battling
Nelson's father. He asserts that the
shoes worn by [ the Battling Dane's parent
and his - own were make from the same
log. ' x - .}:'Â£.
Gustavsen stumbled upon a pile v of
bricks that were lying on the "edge of
the Barbary Coast early yesterday morn-,
ing. In about "two -minutes the air
was full of them. Gustavsen was not
particular where they went so long as
he kept the skies obscured by a cloud
of bricks. Some went through windows,
some .went through roofs and doors.
Policeman Skain dodged through the hail
of bricks and placed Gustavsen under
arrest
When he was haled before Judge Mogan
Gustavsen .'-burst; Into' tears. "Ay been
yagged, Yudge," he pleaded. "Don't
send me to] yail. * r Ay bay good."
He promised never again to look . upon
the bricks when they! were red and Judge
Mogan dismissed \u25a0 him.
J.H. Fischer Jr., proprietor of a pickle
works near Black Point, was found guilty
by Judge Mogan of having minors in hia
employ. He will be sentenced to-morrow.
Judge Mosan showed that he i was no
believer in. the strenuous life. John Cun
ningham, champion- vaquero of Butcher
town/ was before him, ' accused of riding
an ; untamed bronco at break-neck speed
