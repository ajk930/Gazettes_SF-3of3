PRESIDENT
AND SENATE
NOW AT WAR
Action on Treaties
Means an Open
Rupture.
Execntiye Will Drop All
Arbitration Negotiations
With Europe.
Saturday's Vote Makes Secretary of
State Hay Only a Clerk of the
Upper House.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING. '
Washington. Feb. That the !
President will follow the line of action ;
indicated in his letter to the Senate and j
refuse to exchange ratifications with
ether countries on the, arbitration
treaties is regarded here as a foregoine
conclusion. The treaties are dead and
the Senate is willing to accept the re
eponsibility for killing them, believing
that it has at last seized what it has ,
so long strived for â the treaty making j
power of the Government. Hereafter
no arbitration can be undertaken with
out the Senate first putting on the sug
gestion its "O. K." mark; nor can the j
President take any initiative during j
the life of the present administration
in the direction of improving Ameri
can foreign relations or removing fric
tion with other nations without first j
consulting the Senate.
The approval of the Committee on
foreign Relations no longer counts,
because Secretary Hay had obtained j
that before he negotiated the treaties I
just killed. The Government, no mat- :
ter how pressing may be a matter of |
international importance, must wait
until the Senate meets and voj.es its '
sentiments. Indeed, the office of Sec
retary of State has. by the action of
the Senate yesterday, become little
more than that of clerk of the Senate, j
The opinion was expressed , to-day by
* very important officer of the Govern
ment that time had come when no
treaty could be negotiated ' with : any
foreign Government until it had first
been sent to the Senate and ratified.
EFFECT OF SENATE'S ACTION.
This is a revolutionary change in the
practices of the United States. Here
tofore the State Department having
negotiated a treaty, it has been signed
by the Secretary of State and by the
diplomatic representative of the con
tracting Government and then sent to
the Senate. When the Senate ratified
It the treaty has been transmitted to
the contracting Government and rati
fications have been exchanged. But
so frequent has become the practice of
the Senate in amending treaties, thus
rendering them objectionable, that it
is likely that hereafter before a treaty
is signed in the negotiations it will
have to be passed upon by the full
Senate.
But more interesting to Washington,
because it is nearer home, is the ques
tion as to what the effect of the Sen
me's revolt will be on the influence of
the President with Congress on other
jnatters. There is no disguising the
fact that the Senate lias been planning
for a long time some expression of in
dependence of the President. The
Kanto Domingo incident intensified
this desire.
.But other things conspired to bring
about the revolt. On*> of them was the
iusistence of the President upon rate
Jf pislation. Many Senators rejoiced at
the- opportunity of bAiging about a
breach between the President and the
upper house of Congress for the pur
pose of stiffening the backs of many
who wore inclined to be under the
President's influence.
DRAMATIC SIARFT SESSION.
Other Presidents have had favorite
projects squelched by the Senate, but
no President in this generation, wise
men of the Senate say. has ever been
rebuked as President Roosevelt was
yesterday. â¢ That - rebuke was drastic,
historic, caloric. Its effects was mor
noticeable to-day than last night.
Many features are now manifest that
perve to emphasize the firm determina
tion of the Senate to "teach the Presi
dent a lesson." The executive sessions
preceding the final vote are described
an the most dramatic in the memory of
those who have been Senators for twen
ty years. Such Intensity of feeling,
earnestness of speech, unanimity of
sentiment, have not prevailed on any
other similar proposition since the
Civil War.
The criticism and censure of the
President were absolutely V non-parti
san. While all Democrats voted to
amend the treaties, all Republicans but
nine did the same thing. There 'was
no apparent differences in the manner
of expressing the conviction that â  the
President was trying to take away the
constitutional rights of the Senate.
IiOIKiF'K VOTE A SURPRISE.
The action of Senators Lodge,'
Spooner and Foraker, all close friends
of the President and his spokesmen , in
the Senate, attracted unusual atten
tion. All three recited the friendship
tliey fÂ«?lt for the President. They told
of thoir^ intimate relations. All, ex
pressed keen regret that their* <fiths
end consciences would not permit them
to sustain the President in the pending
m atttr. Lodge was especially dramatic
â when he declared that under* his oath
he could not vote in accordance with
the President's wishes, at the same
time â¢ ..king with sincere regret of
conditions which, under ordinary cir
eumetances, would dictate that he act
otherwise.
It was Â«aid to-day by those in close
touch with all public events : that- the
agreement for the protection of Santo
Domingo through ' supervision of that
republic's finances had no j effect on

ATLANTA, Ga., Feb. 13.â A long dis
tance telephone message from Mobile
says one person was killed and several
seriously injured in the Battle House
fire.
MOBILE, Ala., Feb. 13.â Losses esti
mated at $1,000,000 have been caused by
a fire that to-night left the famous
Eattle House a ruin and swept on to
buildings adjoining. The blaze was
discovered shortly before 11 o'clock last
night, and at '1 o'clock this morning
the firemen were still fighting the
flames, which apparently were beyond
control.
The fire broke out in some unoccu
pied rooms over the kitchen of the
Battle House, which, although an old
hostelry, v.as one of the largest in the
South. The flames spread so quickly
that a number of guests lost all their
belongings and many of those on the
fifth floor were compelled to take to
the fire escapes in their night clothes.
Two elevator boys, Joseph Parks and
Bernard Constantine, stuck to their
posts until all the guests had been
taken out, although the elevators
caught fire and the youngsters were
burned about the face and hands.
An hour after the fire started all the
electric lights in the business portion
of the city went out, due to the turn
ing off of the power to save the fire
men from danger.
At 2 o'clock this morning the fire,
still burning fiercely, wag threatening
the '.'ommercial Hotel adjoining. All
the guests escaped, leaving their prop
erty in the hotel. An extension of the
fire was also threatened on the east
side.

Awful Experience of
Man and Woman
in Alaska.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 12.â Charles W.
Cook and Mrs. Rita Wolfenden have
lived through an almost unbelievable
experience. They are now at Kayak,
Alaska, recovering their strength after
going nine days without food, other
than the flesh of their small dog. Six
of these days were spent at sea In an
open whaleboat, the seams of which
opened, necessitating constant bailing.
Cook and the woman left Yakataga
for Kayak to overhaul two men who
had robbed them of $600. The boat
began leaking, but before they could
reach shore they were blown to sea by
a terrific wind, which continued six
days. Their food was spoiled by salt
water. A drenching rain fell most
of the time. Becoming delirious, Cook
jumped overboard, but Mrs. Wolfen
den seized him by the sweater and
pulled him back into the boat. Cook's
delirium continued for two days, when
Mrs. Wolfenden became delirious.
On the evening of the sixth day they
were blown ashore at Cape St. Elias.
The boat struck rocks and was wreck
ed. The couple waded ashore, fol
lowed by the dog. They built a fire
with difficulty and roasted seaweed,
but it gave them no strength. The
nearest habitation was White Head
Point, twenty miles distant. They
finally killed the dog, eating Its roasted
flesh without garnishment. Two days
later they were able to walk to White
Head.

FLORENCE, Feb. 12. â The Countess
Montignoso has been victorious in the
first stage of her struggle with the
King of Saxony, her former husband,
over their daughter. Princess Anna
Monica Pia. For the present at least
the child will remain with her mother.
The lawyers of the Countess after a
meeting with Dr. Koerner, the emis
sary of the King of Saxony, declared
tha L orders of foreign authorities can
not be executed In Italy and that the
case will have to be tried first in the
courts of law.
The lawyers assert that even should
the King of Saxony be victorious in
the courts, there would be difficulty in
enforcing a decree taking the child

SAN FRANCISCO. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1905.
WARNS HIS
PARTNER TO
BE CAREFUL
Mitchell's Letter to
Tanner in Hands
of Heney.
Epistle Considered Strong
Evidence Against the
Senator.
Correspondence Believed to Have
Prompted Testimony Given by
Associate of Accused.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 12.â Among
the papers brought by Senator Mit
chell's secretary, Harry C. Robertson,
from Washington, D. C, was one from
Behator Mitchell to his law partner,
Judge Albert H. Tanner, dealing with
their partnership agreement?. The let
ter was surrendered by Robertson to
United States District Attorney Heney.
The Government considers this letter
of Senator Mitchell's valuable to its
case in that they contend that it shows
the line of testimony which Mitchell
desired Tanner to give before the
Grand Jury on his second appearance
before that body. The letter follows;
"Washington, D. C, Feb. 5, 1905.
"My Dear Judge: I am almost afraid
to write a word, as the scoundrels will
misconstrue everything and distort all
that is said. Your friend with letter
did not arrive here until to-day. Your
letter only received at 3 p. m. I have
made search for my articles of to-"
partnership of 1902, but am unable to
ttnd them. I think it must be among
by papers in oflice. Harry, of course,
prepared these articles. You will see
Harry on his arrival. I found our
supplemental agreements, of date No
vember 1, 1904, which are all right.
Harry has these with him.
"Now the facts are these, and you
must deal with them accordingly.
First, under our articles I was not to
have any interest whatever in any
business you might do in any of the
departments with any land matters.
Second, as a matter of fact, I never
knew until now that any charges for
any such services had been credited
either to me or the firm or that my ac
count, had ever been credited with any
part thereof.
NO STATEMENTS.
"I was never furnished with any
statement of any bank account or ot
any other things whatever, and I have
nothing to do with the book, nor did I
see the same, and you will remember
several times I cautioned you not to
mix me up in any way with any land
office matters. Third, to this day I do
not know what book entries you have
made or what you did with any cash
or checks, if you ever received any for
service. Nor was I ever advised by you
or did I have any knowledge that any
part of any such cash or receipts was
placed either to the credit of our firm
or myself.
"Now, Judge, you will agree with me.
I am sure, these are the facts, and I
am also sure whatever entries you
made you never intended I should have
any part of such cash or checks, If any,
and that you intended that in some
way in settling accounts between us no
part of any such moneys or checks
should be mine, but your individual
property. I had supposed, of course,
that you had kept all such charges and
accounts In your own name.
"There Is no offense on your part in
doing business for honest people In
these land matters. I hope, therefore,
you will do me justice at the proper
time in giving the facts just as they
are and as I have stated them. You
must not get rattled or alarmed.
"Harry will doubtless identify the co
partnership articles of 1902 as having
been prepared by him. See him at once
on his arrival. Don't be Interviewed
until I see you, and now, strictly con
fidential, don't tell Harry, your son, or
any one.
WANTS FIRM'S BOOKS.
"Can't you immediately on receipt
of this, drop everything and come di
rectly here? Bring with you In trunk,
but don't let your family or any one
know, all the company's books, day
ledger, all of them; also your bank
book, as I am extremely anxious to
see for myself personally what the
books show. Besides, It is important
we should talk over with Fulton, who
is to help defend me In regard to the
costs. I hope you can. come. If so,
don't let a soul know you are coming,
not even Harry. And if you conclude
to come wire me as follows: 'John
leaves direct for Washington this
evening. TANNER.'
"I do hope you can come and im
mediately before you are called again
boforc the Grand Jury. Sincerely
your friend.
"JOHN H. MITCHELL,."
"P. S. â Don't show Harry this let
ter, or tell him anything in it. Don't
let him see our books. Tell him
nothing.
"P. S. â Keep all important papers
in safe and safe and office carefully
locked, as these scoundrels will get in
if possible.
"P. X.â Burn this without fail."
Subsequent to writing this letter
Senator Mitchell sent two messages
to Judge Tanner, which will be intro
duced as further evidence by the Gov
ernment in support of Its contention
that the letter was intended to direct
Judge Tanner's line of testimony. The
messages follow:
"WASHINGTON. Feb. 8. â Hon. A.
H. Tanner. Portland: Harry is due
Portland Thursday mprnlng. Don't
fail to comply with my request. It is
important. Don't be interviewed.
"JOHN H. MITCHELL."
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â Hon. A.
H. Tanner. Portland: Harry is due
grieved. I am sure you are not guilty.
Don't be Interviewed. Say nothing.
Don't fail to comply with my request
in Harry's letter.

CROWDED ELECTRIC CAR LEAPS FROM TRACK
AND THIRTEEN ARE INJURED.
APPROACHES SHARP CURVE AT RAPID RATE
MEN AND WOMEN FLUNG HEADLONG INTO THE STREET

SKULL FRACTURED
Railroad Offers
Coin to Several
of the Maimed
An overcrowded car on the Sutro
Electric line jumped the track at the
Parker avenue and California street
curve yesterday afternoon and caused
injury to thirteen persons, one of
whom, Frank Kettleman, a bookkeeper
for Sperry & Co.'s flour mill at
Stockton, may die. Mrs. Kettle
man, who was seated beside her hus
band when the accident occurred, was
thrown from the car and struck on her
head. She is among those seriously in
jured. The other eleven passengers
were pitched violently from the out&ide
seats or thrown against the doors of
the car. In an instant there was a
panic and women struggled with men
to clear themselves of the mass of
shrieking wounded and hysterical
women.
Fortunately the Children's Hospital !
is diagonally across the street from the ;
scene of the accident, and the hospital j
attendants were quickly summoned to j
render assistance to the injured. With
the help of the unhurt passengers the
wounded were removed to the hospital,
where they received medical attention, j
Kettlemaii was suffering from a frac- |
tyred skull and \t-rnal injuries and j
it was at first futi'ignt that he had
been killed outright. His wife was
found lyirffc beside him unconscious and
near her was C. S. Holmes, who had
accompanied the Kettlemans on a pros
pective trip to the park. Holmes was
cut over the right eye and stunned by
the blow.
Miss Mary Doyle and Mrs. Morris
Greenberg were senseless. The former
on recovering said that she knew noth
ing oÂ£ what had happened from the
time the curve was struck until she
found herself in the hospital. Mrs.
Hurgoyne was able to take care of her
self, although suffering from pfcinful
bruises.
Mrs. J. B. Day and her daughter, after
being treated for slight bruises, re
turned to their home on Howard street
on the next inbound car, as did M. A.
Sheets, who lives at the i\ew Western
Hotel, and two men who refused to
give their names.
CAR AT HIGH SPEED.
The motorman of the unlucky car
was O. Z. Pike. He was bringing his
car down the grade toward Parker ave
nue on the westward trip. According
to his official time this was at 12:52 p.
m., the time he was due at Parker
avenue or thereabouts. He says that
he was not going "very fast." This
statement, however, is contradicted by
witnesses who saw the car approaching
the curve at a great speed. The car
was one of the large double-ender
Sutro motors and was filled with pas
sengers, many of whom were hanging
on the outside and maintaining a pre
carious foothold on the steps.
Conductor H. R. Poland was at the
rear end of the car and did not notice
that the conveyance was going faster
than is customary on approaching the
curve. Pike must have lost control of
the brakes when about half way down
the grade on account of the unusual
weight of human freight. According to
a lad named Eddie Folk, who saw the
car approaching Parker avenue, it sud
denly shot downward as if released
from the hold of the brakes and in a
few seconds was over the tracks and
plunging along on the rough roadbed
of California street.
That the car must have been running
at a high rate of speed Is made evi
dent by the marks of the wheels shown
for a distance of twenty feet in thÂ«
roadway. The car ran its length over
the curve, plowed into the sand and
came to a sudden stop several yards
clear of the rails. A wrecking crew
from the United Railroad shops had
considerable difficulty getting it back
on the tracks, and it was then run
back to the Fillmore street barns. The
car was not greatly damaged.
SETTLING WITH THE INJURED.
While the nurses and doctors at the
Children's Hospital were helping the
wounded to the wards, Policemen Wis
kotchill and Fulwider of the O'Far
rell-street station, who were on duty
at California street and Presidio ave
nue, and Mounted Patrolman Munn
were Informed of the accident and im-'
mediately reported at the hospital and
placed Motorman Pike under arrest,
pending instructions from headquar
ters. Detectives Dinan and Coleman
were Bent out by the central office and
allowed Pike to go. In the meantime
Dr. McElroy and a corps of railroad
surgeons arrived and with .them came
several inspectors for the railroad,
who took it upon themselves to give
orders that no one should be allowed
to see the wounded. They were about
with documents attempting to get the
injured persons to make cash settle
ments even before the bandages were
on their wounds.
Mr. and Mrs. Morris Greenberg were
offered $4 as a balm for their injuries.
Being ignorant that the law in such
matters would protect them In a civil
suit for damages, they finally accepted
$15 and departed after signing an
agreement of some kind protecting the
rpilroad. One of the Inspectors was
exceedingly impudent.
Among the principal witnesses who
were found by the police were: J. C.

SK.UL.Ij IS FRACTURED.
The examination of the wounded j
showed that Mr. Kettleman was in a
very bad way and likely to lose his
life. His skull was fractured and the
scalp badly torn. The extent of his in
ternal injuries could not be deter
mined. Mrs. Kettleman was hysteri
cal on regaining consciousness. She
is suffering from a severe nervous
shock. The- Kettlemans are well
known in Stockton and have been In
this city for about six weeks on a
pleasure trip.
Miss Mary Doyle was cut about the
head, but there was no -fracture. Her
arms and upper part of her body were
bruised. She said that she was sit
ting on the outside of the car when
it struck the curve and was thrown
violently to the ground. The car, she
added, waÂ« going at a high rate of
speed and the motorman did not ap
pear to be making any very great ef
fort to stop it.
J. S. Reed was too ill to do much
talking. His right leg was broken and
he was otherwise painfully but not
seriously hurt. He was flung from the
car when the curve was struck and a
number of passengers fell on top of
him.
Mrs. J. B. Day and her daughter
and Mrs. Burgoyne were not very bad
ly injured. They were inside the car
when the accident occurred, and, al
though somewhat scratched, they suf
fered more from fright than from in
juries.
Morris Greenberg and his wife were
inside the car. Mr. Greenberg was
pitched against the end door and sev
eral passengers fen on him. Mrs.
Greenberg sprained her leg and is suf
fering a great deal of pain; her hus
band bruised his arm and wrist. â¢ C. S.
Holmes was cut up pretty badly, but

with the a^istante of two hospital,at
tendants, to the operating-room.
Mrs. Greenberg had one of the most
exciting experiences of any of the Jn
| Jured passengers other than Mr. and
Mrs. Kettleman. She said:
"My husband and I were on our way
to the Children's Hospital to visit a
sick child that we intrusted to their
care. We were insida the car, near the
end. and when we approached Parker
avenue, where we were to get off, I sig
naled the conductor to stop. I noticed
that he did not answer my signal, and
the car, instead of slacking up, went
ahead at a startling speed. I said to
my husband, 'My! I wonder what is the
matter.'
"The words were scarcely out of my
mouth when the car Jumped the track,
swinging part way into Parker avenue
as it did so. My husband and I were
thrown violently against the side of the

"Against a pile of sand was a man
who had raised himself on his knee and

Two women were on the pavement, and
near the sidewalk Mr. Kettleman was
stretched out. bleeding from a cut on

"My husband helped tpe to the hos

that the company would pay us $4 If we

M. A. Sheets, one of the passengers
who was slightly hurt, says it was re
ported to him by a. passenger that thi:
motorman admitted that he was a new
man on the line and that he had for
gotten about the curve and did not
slack up. The street is In a bad condi
tion at Parker avenue and the curve is
somewhat difficult to observe from thn
car until one is almost on top of it.
Sheets, who is from Baker City, < >r..
describes his experiences graphically a.s>
follows:
"I was standing on the rear Â«Â»n<l of
the steps, grasping the safety hamtlÂ«Â»
with my right hand. As we drew near
the curve I noticed that the car was
moving with hair-raising rapidity, and
I was Inwardly certain that we could
not make the turn at the speed we were
going. The car was swaying from side
to side, and Just before the curve was
reached I tightened my grasp and
closed my eyes.
"The next thing I knew I was flying
head downward Into a pile of sand,
probably the only thing that saved my
life. I had but a haxy recollection of
hurling through the air and that my
hip and back were hurting me. It
would have been Impossible for any
one to have held on to the ear, and th<*
nails were torn back from the fingers
of my right hand In my desperate ef
fort to clutch the rail. I narrowly
missed striking a trolley wire pole in
my tumble. I do not understand the
cause of the accident fully, as I was
too much occupied In recovering my
wits, but I did hear some one say that
the motorman admitted he was a new
man and forgot all about the curve
he was approaching and therefore
neglected to reduce speed.
PIKE SAYS LITTLE.
Motorman Pike made a statement
that he was not going down the grade
at a very rapid speed and that on ap
proaching the curve he was unable to
stop the car. The curve is unusually
sharp at the Parker avenue turn and
it is the custom of motormen to slow
up there. The car gained headway,
jumped over the tracks ancr^plunged
into a bank of sand and clay, swerv
ing sharply from its straight course aa
it did so. This whip-like snap threw
the people from the rear and head ends
on the north side of the conveyance.
Conductor Poland knew little of the
cause of the accident and had been In
structed by the railroad officials to
make no statement to reporters.
Policemen Wiskotehill and Fulwider
reported that while detailed at the cor
ner of California and Presidio avenue
they heard of the accident and went
to the scene. They found car No. 738
oft the track at some distance from
the curve. They arrested Motormaa

Foster said he was greatly disap
pointed at the result bo far attained in !
i the effort to commit the United States {
to the principle of arbitration. He had j
labored to procure the approval of the
' treaties by the Senate without amend
! ment, because he considered the word i
"agreement" in article two of the con
ventions as having the same sig
nificance in international law as the
word "treaty"; but when the, matter
was brought into doubt he regarded the j
' Senate as justified in making this clear j
by amendment, as he never contem- j
plated that the President would have j
the power under the treaties to make
an agreement to submit a case to The
Hague court without "the advice of the j
i co-ordinate branch of the treaty-mak- i
Ing power. a â  '
It was most unfortunate that there I
should arise an apparently divergence !
of views between the executive and the :
Senate, said Foster. The matter was j
now in the hands of the President, and ;
Foster : said he had great confidence j
that that statesman, who had shown j
himself the most ardent friend of ar- i
bitration and had brought the warring
nations in the Venezuela trouble to The
Hague, and thus rendered the cause of
arbitration the greatest service of any â¢
man of his generation, would find a.
way to reconcile the existing differences !
and save the United States from be- !
coming the most backward of the na- â¢
tions in the cause of international '
peace. i
. Foster said he was authorized to give j
out the following telegram from An- !
drew Carnegie: j
NEW YORK. Feb. 12. 1905. â John W. ;
Foster. Washington. D. C. : You can truly j
say that I am forced to see that the Senate ,
only did itp duty. I could not have done <
otherwise than vote with the majority, though i
with such reluctance as Senators Lodge, Spooner \
Cullom and others expressed. The absentees j
from volinif are as significant as the over- J
whelming vote. I know the President and
Secretary of State are Just as clear and honest
Jr. their convictions as the Senate is. The j
Senate might adopt a rule to give specific j
treaties submitted instant consideration, an.l ;
then foreign powers would not have to wait, j
Surely something can be done that will har- '
monize the two parties anxious to promote the j
same noble end. . -- â  â¢ CARNEGIE.
Foster further said that Hon. Wayne \
MacVeagh, former Attorney General, :
had authorized him to make public the â 
following statement of his views con- ',
cerning the constitutional question In
volved: j
The language of our constitution, framed by , j
the wisdom of our fathers, is exceptionally;
plain and imperative as to the treaty-making: :
power. It requires as a condition precedent to
the making of any treaty (and every agree
ment between this country and any foreign
wr should be considered a treaty, because
the constitution bo call? it) that it should be
submitted to the Senate, and that two-thirds
of t'le Senators shall cencur in the wisdom of j
maintaining it. Their concurrence makes It i
"part of the supreme law of the land." Is it
conceivable that, in view of such provisions, a :
President alone can make any action- of his a ,
part of the supreme law of the land? If so, i
our "supreme law". would be subjected to the |
caprice of every successor of President Roose
velt, and the wife men who framed the constl- 1
tuticn knew it would be unsafe to Intrust the ;
la wreaking power to any one man. The lan- i
guage of the Supreme Court on the subject is
very emphatic, as follows:
'It need hardly be said that a treaty rennet
change the constitution, or be held valid if In
violaticn of that instrument. This results from
tl.e nature and fundamental principles of our
Government."

I was sitting on the outside of the

MISS GEETS REPORT.
Miss Mabel Gee. who arrived in San
Francisco last Monday from Honolulu
and is staying at the Westminster, was
on the car with Mr. and Mrs. Kettle
man and suffered a shock from the ac
cident. Last evening Miss Gee became
conscious of pains in the back and in
the region of the spine and was also
in a nervous condition. In speaking of
the occurrence she said that just prior
to the accident she and her friends
were engaged in conversation and she
therefore did not pay any particular
attention to the speed at which the
car was traveling, but when it jumped
the track she realized that they were
traveling fast.
C. S. Holmes of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company w r as in company
with the Kettlemans. He says the rate
the car was traveling as it reached the
curve was excessive. While the speed
might have been all right on a straight
line, in his judgment it was much too
great for turning so sharp a corner.

LONDON. Feb. 12.-Parliament win
open next Tuesday, when King Edward
will go from Buckingham Palace to
Westminster, where he will deliver the
speech from the throne amid the Im
posing ceremonial that Is customary
when the sovereign is present on this
occasion in person.
This spectacular feature will be the
curtain-raiser to a grim struggle be
tween Prime Minister Balfour's admin
istration and the Liberal opposition.
Close observers are a unit in their con
fidence in the staying powers of the
Government. Rumors of a dissolution
of the Government are just as rife and
just as positive as were the statements
made a year ago, when the prognosti
cators gave Balfour only strength suf
ficient to read the budget. Now it is
argued that dissolution will come
quickly, even within the limit of debate
on the reply to the address from the
throne. Whips have received warning
to be ready for a general election.
Liberal leaders express the conviction
that the Government will be unable to
maintain a majority and is certain of
defeat, either as a result of desertion
by Unionists when the question of free
food comes up or apathy by the Minis
terialists.

"J. P. Morgan is much worried be

"Even the famous collection of draw

man lost control of the car at a gravel
switch with a dead end. He opened
the car door and warned all the pas

The passengers who remained in

CUTS PRICES;
STARTS A WAR
Merry How Between Doctors
of Spokane Results From
Rate-Cutting by a Medico
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CaJL
SPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 12.â War
among^ the medicos of Spokane, to
gether with the giving out of a pub
lished scale of prices for all operations
from the amputation of a finger to re
moving one's internal apparatus, also
the price list for the ordinary case re
quiring no scalpel or saw, is stirring
the lame, the halt and the blind in
Spokane.
The resignation of St. Luke's Hos
pital staff gives vent to the mental
sufferings of the physicians themselves.
It has intensified the bitterness existing
between the Spokane County Medical
Society and the Spokane Clinical Asso
ciation.
The trouble arose when the hospital
people insisted upon having Dr. C. P.
Thomas on the staff. He is a clinical
surgeon who has a record with the
scalpel that is a wonder. Hardly a day
passes that he does not delve into the
internal affairs of one or more patients.
If he stays on the staff the rest of the
staff, which includes most of the prom
inent practitioners in Spokane, will not
serve. It is war to the knife. The scale
of prices ranges from $5 for topping off
a finger to $200 for appei|dicitls. If
more than one physician Is called extra
is charged. For sawing off a leg the
price is $100 at the hospital, at your own
house $25 extra. For delicate surgery
the prices range from $25 for men to
$150 for women. This scale, it is
claimed, is enforced by both sides and
they intimate that competition means
cutting of prices.

'*No Compromise" Is Slogan
of Friends of Measure That

City of San Francisco
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» CaJL
SACRAMENTO, Feth 12.â The grad
uate nurses of California are going to
take as prominent a place before the
present Assembly as the woman suf
fragists and the lobby of the latter
interest with its spectacles and short
skirts is in danger of being displaced
in popular interest with the legislator
by a bevy of demure and pretty young
women wearing the becoming insignia
of the red cross. Assemblyman George
McGowan, who is championing a
registration bill urged by the Nurses'
Training School graduates of the City
and County Hospital of San Francisco,
which turns out more trained nurses
than any other hospital in the metrop
olis, says he will have a lobby of bed
side angels here before the session is
over that will make the passage of any
bill it advocates irresistible. His fel
low legislators are looking forward with
much expectancy to the arrival of this
fair aggregation.
There Is no disposition on the part of
the Legislature to refuse passage of an
act providing for the registration of
trained nurses and giving them a strict
professional standing, but it appears
from the fact that there are three bills
in the Assembly covering the same
matter generally, but which differ in
some important details that the nurses
themselves are not agreed as to just
what they want and the contest will
be as to which faction gets its bill
through.
Assemblyman McGowan's bill pro
vides that only graduates of such train
ing schools as are recognized by the
regents of the State University Bhall
be examined; that a two years' course
shall be sufficient; that applicants
shall be at least twenty-one years of
age. and that the regents shall appoint
a State Examining Board of five to con
sist of thoÃe applicants for the posi
tion of examiner who shall pass the
highest at an examination to be held
by the regents.
DURYEA HAS A BILL.
Assemblyman Duryea has introduced
a bill providing that the California
State Nurses' Association shall nomi
nate ten of its members from whom
the university regents shall choose five
for a State Board of Examiners, which
shall examine all applicants who have
passed a three years' course at some
reputable hospital. Graduates of hos
pitals approved by the regents shall be
registered without examination.
Assemblyman Beckett Is the author
of the third bill, which provides that
the California State Nurses' Associa
tion shal' nominate ten members from
which the examining board shall be
chosen, but it leaves the university
regents out, the Governor being
named as the appointing power of the
five to conduct examinations. This
examining board is given the power of
approving hospitals whose graduates
shall not be registered without exam
ination. A three years' course is pro
vided for and the minimum age limit
is fixed at twenty-three years. There
is no maximum.
Something of a rivalry is arising be
tween McGowan, Beckett and Duryea
as to which will produce the most
fetching lobby, but it is probable that
McGowan, being one of the best looking
of the young lawyers of the Assembly,
has his rivals beaten.
The three bills have some added im
portance as representing rivalries in
the medical fraternity and among the
hospitals, and the doctors may take a
hand before any one of them becomes
a law.
Upon proper registration the nurses
will be entitled to append the letters
"R. N." to their names as an evidence
of their professional standing. No per
son is prohibited from nursing for hire
by any of the measures, providing he
or she does not use this "R. N." It is
claimed that untrained imposters will
be shut out of the nursing field by the
operation of any of the proposed meas
ures.
SCHOOL FUNDS BILL.
There is going to be no compromise
on the school fund apportionment bill
now before the Assembly. Though it
deprives San Francisco of a large part
of the money that city is receiving un
der the present law, its authors will
consent to no amendment suggested
by the San Francisco School Depart
ment. The only course left for the
representatives of the metropolis is to
force an amendment when the bill
comes up for second reading, and fail
ing in this to defeat It, if possible,
when It is called for final passage.
This course has been decided upon.
There will be no more sessions of
the Educational Committee upon the
bill. This committee recommended it
for passage once and upon a protest
being made by San Francisco interests
it was referred back to the committee,
that all sides might have a chance to
present their objections or their points
in favor of its passage. Several meet
ings were held. There was much de
bate and many plans were advanced.
At the last meeting of the committee
Professor Mark Keppel, Superintendent
of Schools of Los Angeles, which city
will also be a heavy loser if the bill
becomes a law, advanced a plan un
Â«der which Los Angeles would lose
nothing, but San Francisco's loss would
be doubled.
W. R. Langdon, Superintendent of
Schools of San Francisco, and other
representatives of the School Depart
ment of that city who were present,
complimented Professor Keppel warm
ly on his clever handling of the sub
ject, but said that unless he could also
figure the metropolis out of the losing
column they would hardly agree to his
plan.
Superintendent Langdon made a sug
gestion that the whole matter go over
for two years and that a holdover com
mittee of three members each from the
Senate and the Assembly Education
committees, to which should be added
the Governor and the State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction, be ap
pointed to investigate the school money
apportionment matter during the next
two years and report at the next ses
sion of the Legislature such measures
as their research showed them to be
the best.

Spaelal Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â Senator
Clay's anti-option bill now pending in
the Senate is a renewal on new lines
of the old fight between the American
farmer and the gambler in the necessi
ties of life. The bill prohibits dealing
in options or futures by mail or tele
graph in raw or unmanufactured cot
ton, wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley,
wheat flour, pork, lard and baconâ that
is, it prohibits the use of the mails and
telegraph between the States to any
person or corporation for the purpose
of entering into contracts known as op
tions or futures.
Senator Clay considers the bill of
such importance that "he will attempt
to get it through as an amendment to
the posoffice approprlaion bill, but
many Senators contend that it contains
so much matter not germane to this
bill that it will be impossible to pass it
as a rider. On this account the Clay
measure has little chance of passage at
this session.
"Whether it is passed now or not,"
said Senator Clay to-day, "it is really
the beginning â or rather a renewal â
of the most important war yet waged
between the farmers and the dealers in
futures. I introduced this bill at the
request of the recent convention of
Southern cotton planters in New Or
leans, where the matter was discussed
at length. I may say that the entire
South is deeply interested in this ques
tion. The people there think that
manipulation of the market for the
necessities of life is altogether too Im
portant a factor in regulating the price
to the producers. Supply and demand
should settle what this price should be,
and not the man who deals In options.
"For instance, the increase In the
production of cotton this year would
not naturally force the price down to
the present low notch. It would not
have gone so far, in the opinion of most
planters, had it not been for the men
whom they designate as gamblers.
Years ago the Hatch anti-option bill
attracted great attention. It passed both
houses, but finally died In conference."

for an apportionment on a basis of
$300 per teacher employed for the whole
term. The amendment desired by San
Francisco will be offered by one of the
delegation from that city and the first
fight on the measure will begin.
Slaven himself has an amendment
that he will introduce, but it will of
fer no relief to San Francisco. He has
not announced what it is, but it is said
that it makes matters even worse for
the metropolis.
Slaven claims that he has enough
votes of interior members pledged to
tarry his amendment, beat any offered
by San Francisco and to pass the bill.
There will be few absentees when the
matter is brought up Wednesday, as all
the junketing trips will be over by
that time. Slaven claims he has a
strength of fifty votes.
There are five counties that will
unite to oppose the Slaven bill â San
Francisco, Santa Clara, Los Angeles,
Alameda and Marin. All these will
lose under the plan of apportioning
by the number of teachers employed
instead of by the number of census
children.
Assemblyman Slaven is a school
principal of San Juan. The bill he
has introduced is favored by the Gov

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 12. â The
official announcement of Embassador
McCormick's promotion to the Paris
embassy is received with surprise and
regret in diplomatic circles here,
where it had been understood that
McCormick probably would retain his
present post during the coming ad

SORROW FLEES
FROM ORPHEUM
Bill Is Composed of Funny
Features That Keep the
Audiences in an Iproar
There is absorbing interest in every
number on the Orpheum bill this week,
from Ford and Wilson, blackface
comedians, to the moving pictures.
Happy Jack Gardner, musical mono
logist. and Bert Howard and Leona
Bland, iri a side-splitting sketch, were
the favorites with yesterday's audi
ences. Howard is a wonder at the
piano. His imitations of everything
from a hand organ to Paderewski were
convulsing.
Bob and George Qulgley, in an act
entitled "At the Toll Gate." are funny
enough to make boodling State Sena
tors forget their troubles. Paulton and
Dooley offer something good in the
way of bicycle riding. The comedy end
of the partnership is particularly good.
Bob Cole and Rosamond Johnson
dance and sing in their same old way
that has always been so pleasing to
San Francisco audiences. Some of
their songs are new and others are
pleasant revivals of old favorites.
Robert H. Hodge and company in the
"Troubles of Bill Blithers, Bachelor."
do not fall behind their stage asso
ciates in provoking laughter. Newell
and Niblo play the saxophone and
xylophone admirably. Every feature
of the programme has something to
make the audience look pleasant, at
least, and some of the numbers are the
limit for fun.
Harry Beresford In "Our New Man"
was the attraction last night at the
California Theater, and Beresford will
continue to be the attraction. The play
and the rest of the players. with the
excention of the winsome women of the
company, do not receive their share of
the attention when Beresford is on the
stage. While "Our New Man" is a
comedy having a well defined plot,
there are parts of it that are drag^y
and should be polished up. When
Beresford appears, however, his droll
humor and quaint portrayal of the
botanist often convulses the audience.
Peter Morrison as Tanner and Miss
Julia Batchelder as Dolly Charters are
good and Mrs. Kate Bruce as Mrs.
Bolter was acceptable.
SYMPATHY EXPRESSED
WITH KANSAS OIL MEN
Trust Severely Scored at Meeting
of the Producers of Ohio
and Indiana.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Feb. 12. â At %
meeting of the Western Oil Men's As
sociation, composed of crude oil pro
ducers in the Trenton-Rock oil fields
of Ohio and Indiana, the situation in
Kansas was discussed by the forty
members present and the following
resolutions were unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That it is the sense of the pro
ducers and others interested here assembled,
that the State of Kansas is entitled to sym
pathy and moral support of the oil trade
everywhere in lta contest with the Standard
Oil Company.
That In the recent action of the said com
pany in promulgating the extraordinary order
suspending operations In the Kansas field it
lias violated high-class business principles and
been guilty of an act that is against good
public policy.
That in view of the fact that thÂ» ratÂ« of
equal rights has been Ignored by the oompany.
we hope that the State will see that the in
dependent producers have a square deal and
are supported In a substantial manner In their
efforts to obtain relief from an oppressive sit
uation.
That in maintaining their priority rights
they should receive all necessary aid not only
from the State, but from oil producers in all
other fields.

ANNAPOLIS, Md., Feb. 12. â Since
the dismissal of Midshipman Weller of

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 12 âThe ex
pectation of a renewal of trouble
â imong the workmen to-day was not
realized. Neither strikers nor students
made the slightest attempt to demon
strate and throughout the day the city
presented a normal appearance. The
Emperor's creation of a joint commis
sion of masters and workmen chosen
uy themselves to investigate the
auses of diÃt-ontent among the la
borers has made an exceedingly good
rnpreseion, being considered definite
evidence of the Government's purpose I
to compel some of the masters who
have paid starvation wages to do jus
lice to their employes.
The imperial decree ordering the for
mation of the committee reposes the
;<iesidency of the body in Senator Chid
iovski, a member of the Council of the ;
Empire, and instructs the committee j
to ascertain immediately the ca-uses of \
discontent of St. Petersburg's work- ;
men and devise measures to prevent ,
*<uch discontent in future. The com
mittee consists of representatives of
Government departments, the various j
industries and the workmen. The i
president is authorized to report in â

the number and mode of selection of j
the committee.

WARSAW, Feb. 12.â Baron yon Nol
chief of police of Warsaw, who

Governor General Tchertkoff of
; rovince of Warsaw, to-day gave
following details regarding the
state of affairs in this district:
The strike continues in all of the big

'hÂ» police will expel all of those living

â¢hey will not work they must go home.
The men have no money and it seems
sible that the strike can continue

difficulty. We are not fighting an eco
but a political movement, hav
rs origin in St. Petersburg.
"The worst troubles, however, are

such a scale as the earlier riots here."

TYRANT'S DARK SHADOW
ON ST. PETERSBURG.
TREPOFF HOLDS SWAY
RUSSIAN OFFICER. WHO HAS BEEN PI^ACBD EN CHARGE OF THE CITT OF 1
ST. PETERSBURG. AND WHO FOR HIS HARSH MEASURES HAS COME TO
BE CALLED "IRON HEART' BY TROOPS.
LONDON, Feb. 12.â Much has been
printed about General Trepoff, the
newly appointed Governor General of
St. Petersburg, but some stories of
him, which have just come to hand,
are â worth relating because of the
light they shed on his character and
the indications they afford of the un
scrupulous use he will make of his
despotic powers.
That Trepoff is a ruthless tyrant
his sanguinary record as Chief of Po
lice of Moscow has proclaimed to the
world, but the underhand methods
which he there employed to attain
his ends are known only to a few. Stu
dents and other revolutionary agents
had succeeded in forming several se
cret societies among the workmen of
the White City and occasionally in
cited them to engage in strikes of a
semi-political character. To counter
act this movement, regardless of the
loss inflicted on his dupes, General
Trepoff undertook to organize strikes
and secret societies on his own ac
count.
Numerous police spies obtained em
ployment in various factories and
started a workmen's union, making
specious promises of procuring for its
members a large increase of wages
and compensation for any temporary
loss of employment they might suffer.
The ignorant operatives were induced
to give credence to these assurances
by the statement that the movement
was favored by the authorities, who
were bent on helping the poor against
capitalistic oppression. The rival agi
tators were denounced as paid emis
saries of the employers.
ATTEMPT AT BLACKMAIL*.
For a time Trepoff's scheme had
the effect he desired. Workmen in
large numbers seceded from the socie
ties which had been formed for polit
ical purposes, pledges of a speedy In
crease of pay proving more alluring
to them than remote prospects of ob
taining constitutional government
Then Trepoff struck a snag. The
manager of a foreign firm long estab
lished in Moscow saw through his
game and dismissed a couple of police
spies who had found employment In
the factory In the guise of workmen.
A delegation of the police-organized
"workmen's" union thereupon de
manded an audience with the man
agement. But the manager â¢was not
to be caught in that trap. Such or
ganization being illegal had he en
tered into negotiations with one of
them, he would have rendered him
self and the firm liable to severe pen
alties. Therefore he refused to see
the delegation.
The next move was a visit from Tre
poff's aide-de-camp, who Insisted that
the dismissed men should be taken
back and the delegation received. The
manager refused. Next followed a
message from Trepoff summoning a
member of the firm to police headquar
ters. Trepoff told him that if the firm
did not obey his orders he would shut
down the works and expel the manager
and chief partners from Russia.
To that threat the manager replied
that he would yield to compulsion and
admit the delegation, but that he would
take steps to protect htmeself In his ler
gal rights. The delegates demanded the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1905,
reinstatement of the dismissed men,
$55,000 as compensation and a huge in
crease of wages. Of course the de
mands were refused and all the men in
the works struck.
RECEIVES A REPRIMAND.
The manager thereupon informed
General Trepoff thafVie should seek re
dress through his embassy. The Chief
of Police began to suspect that he had
gone too Jar, for a foreigner cannot be
suppressed In the same summary fash
ion in Russia that a native can. He
called at the works, but the manager
declined to see him and slipped off by
the 8 o'clock train that night for St.
Petersburg. Trepoff followed by the
next train he could catchâ the mid
night one â to work his "pull" with the
central Government.
The manager had made the most of
his four hours' start. At the capital he
hunted up his Embassador immediate
ly and got him to intimate in the
proper quarters that unless matters
were straightened out "complications"
with his own Government would fol
low. â When Trepoff arrived on the
scene he received a reprimand for hav
ing failed to appreciate the necessity
of discriminating between a foreigner
and a Russian in the exercise of his
official functions. To teach him to be
more cautious in the future he was
compelled to apologize to the manager
and was suspended from his Job for
three months. Meanwhile the strike
had spread to other works. It lasted
several weeks, the workmen losing
$320,000 in wages and gaining no ad
vantage whatever from It.
AGAIN MEETS TROUBLE.
On another occasion Treooff fell foul
of a foreigner and suffered discomfiture.
He has a mania for furious driving
through the streets, and woe betide the
poor Russian who has the misfortune to
impede his progress. He expects every
body and everything to make way for
his august person. One dark night while
he was still Chief of Police of Moscow
the passage of his carriage through a
narrow street was blocked by another
vehicle, whose occupant calmly disre
garded his irate command to drive into
a Bide thoroughfare. He ordered a pass
ing policeman to arrest the insolent fel
low. The prisoner turned out to be an
Englishman of high rank, who, al
though he could speak no Russian, had
very definite and decided opinions con
cerning the rights of Englishmen any
where on the public highways of the
world. Again Trepoff was reprimanded
and had to apologize.
At another time, after cursing him
roundly, he caused the arrest of a de
crepit looking man who had the effron
tery while crossing a str^t to get in
the way of his carriage. It dhanced
that the old fellow with the shaky legs
wag a Russian Prince, an ex-Governor
General of an important province and
various other things, and possessed be
sides a tremendous sense of his own
dignity. Trepoff saved his job by apol
ogizing.
As Chief of Police of Moscow he was
not a success. Crime, drunkenness,
regulation of street traffic and the or
dinary matters with which the police
are supposed to chiefly concern them
selves in civilized communities ht re
PATS LINCOLN
HIGH TRIBUTE
Dr. I. C. Meserve Finds Close
Comparison Between Loved
President and the Savior
AJtf AN FIT FOR POWER
Was of the People, Honest
and One Worthy of Honor,
Says Divine in Sermon
Abraham Lincoln's birthday was ob
served in a number of the churches of
the city yesterday. The Rev. Dr. I. C.
Meserve delivered a beautiful tribute to
the martyred President at Plymouth
Congregational Church in the presence
of a large assemblage of worshipers.
Dr. Meserve said in part.
Lincoln was a man of the people. He was
born of very humble parentage and in poverty.
He was in thorough sympathy with the com
mon people, understood them well, and be
lieved In their quod sense and patriotism.
Being a man cast In a large mold, he was cer
tain to be a popular leader, and a popular
leader he was in the truest sense and largest
degree. His life story Is as interesting aa that
of any hero of history or romance. He comes
very near belns the ideal American citizen.
When he came upon the stage of action the
eld time leaders had all gone. Only one man
looms large In the Middle West, SJtephen A.
Douglas by name. Douglas was the making of
Lincoln, wholly without intention. Douglas
proposed the Kansas-Nebraska legislation
which opened the cjuestlon of slavery again.
Lincoln became liis opponent in Illinois, but
Douglas secured the election to the United
States Senate over Lincoln In 1858. Their an
tagonism and debates made Lincoln known
over the land, and he had 101 votes for Vice
President in the convention that nominated
Fremont for President.
There ia a close comparison between Lincoln
and Jesus Christ. Both sprang from the peo
ple and had a youthtime of labor. Both were
uneducated in the schools, but highly taught
by nature, events, observation, hard work and
God. Both were very unusual men In their
relation to their times. To each it was given
to lead a people out of bondage. Lincoln was
God's man for the destruction of slavery in
this land. Christ was God's man for the de
struction of sin in the world. Both suffered
martyrdom. One became at once a nation's
hero, more and more regarded as time passes,
while the other is the master of mankind,
more loved and obeyed now than ever before.
Lincoln knew himself and his appointment to
so high and noble a work. Christ knew him
self and the boundless reach of his work for
men.
Mr. Lincoln's "shortest and best speech,"
â¢o called by himself, was this: "I am not
much of a Judge of religion, but In my opinion
the religion that sÂ»ts men to rebel and fight
against their Government, because, as they
think, that Government does not sufficiently
help some men to eat their bread in the sweat
of other men's faces. Is not ths sort of re
ligion upon which people can get to heaven."
It was In his last Inaugural that he used
the words since so often quoted, "With mal
ice toward none, with charity for all, with
firmness In the right, as God gives us to see
the right, let us strive on to finish the work
we are In."
The Rev. R. Logan, pastor of Leb
anon Presbyterian Church, delivered a
sterling eulogy on the late President in
hts sermon yesterday. The church was
full ajid the sermon was replete with
historical reference to the days of slav
ery and the remarkable and stirring in
cidents which led up to the Civil War.
FATAL BATTLE
WITH ROBBERS
Two Desperadoes Killed in
an Attempt to Hold Up a
Saloon in Colorado Town
INDEPENDENCE, Colo., Feb. 11. â
Two masked men entered the Silver
Bell saloon to-night and attempted to
hold up the place. As they ap
proached the bar they ordered the
crowd within, numbering fifteen or
twenty, to hoW up their hands and at
the same time commenced shooting.
Nearly all the men at the bar drew
revolvers and opened fire on the rob
bers, with the result that both were
killed before they could get out of the
place. Of those in the saloon three
were wounded, Edward Fay fatally.
Henry Drach was shot in the leg
and groin and is In a precarious con
dition and Frank Edmundson, an ore
weigher, was shot through the hand
and abdomen and his condition Is very
serious.
The robbers have been identified as
William Dugan and Frank Harris,
both miners.
Henry Drach and Edward Fay, the
owners of the saloon, who were shot
in defending their place against the
robbers, are In a critical condition at
the Sisters' Hospital and the physi
cians in attendance hold out no hopes
for their recovery.

The Verein Eintracht will give a
masquerade ball next Saturday even

street. The hall is being artistically
decorated for the affair and a select
orchestra will render dance music.
Valuable prizes will be given to wear

garded aa Insignificant details and be
neath his dignity to pay attention to.
The stern measures he adopted to sup
press the student demonstrations in
Moscow showed him to be possessed of
that indifference to human life and cal
lous brutality that are needed to sus
tain a despotism that exists by crush
ing freedom and terrorizing the popu
laoe.
BRAVERY UNQUESTIONED.
To give him due credit he is un- '
doubtedly a brave man. He would
never take refuge behind a petticoat
like his royar' master. He does not
mind risking assassination, six at- Â»
tempts having been made in Moscow
!to kill him. Twice he was stabbed
! and four times shot at. The last at- I
tempt on his life was made two days
after he had resigned his office at Mos- I
I cow. He did that with the avowed in
tention of going to the front.
"Since I must be shot at," he said
in taking his leave, "I prefer to be a !
target for professional Japanese sol
diers than for dirty amateurs in Mos
cow."
Among the troops he is known by
the suggestive nickname of "Iron
Heart." He showed the sort of stuff

stabbed his orderly, who had been
guilty of some trivial act of disobedi
ence. When a captain he was engaged
in putting down riots in Moscow and

what one British newspaper, that or

termed "Hell In Rebellion."
PASSENGER TRAINS
HELD BY BLIZZARDS
Overland Tourists Snowbound
Kansas Farmers Feed Travelers
En Route to California.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOPBKA, Kans., Feb. 12.â Reports
of the intensity of the blizzard sweep
ing over Kansas to-day are coming to
the railroad offices here and show that
there is great suffering in 'many lo
calities. Many places are out of fuel.
Thousands of cattle are starving for
lack of feed.
A dozen passenger trains are tied up
in snowdrifts in Kansas. Two of these
are transcontinental trains bearing
many passengers to California. These
trains do not carry dining cars and the
imprisoned passengers are tsd by near
by farmers. Whole hams and great
quantities of bacon and bread are
cooked by the farmers" wives and sent
to the trains. Women passengers make
coffee for their companions in big wash
boilers over fires built on the ground.
These trains probably will be released
before morning.
The coldest weather in years pre
vails in this section to-night. At
Kansas City it was 18 degrees below
zero; at Concordia, Kans., 22 below; at
Lawton, Okla., 6 below, and at Tulsa,
I. T., 7 below zero.
In Oklahoma and Indian Territory
the weather is the coldest since 1899,
and there is much suffering among the
poor, who were caught unprepared.
Cattle also are suffering. Great anxiety
is felt for the Indians, who are in no
condition to withstand the storm, and
experts say that dozens of them will
die as a result of the blizzard.
A negro froze to death at Fredonia,
Okla., and a Commanche Indian suc
cumbed to the cold near Lawton.
At Ottawa, Kans., where it is 11 be
low, a coal famine is threatened. The
drain upon dealers because of weeks
of intensely cold weather has depleted
stocks and the mines in that vicinity
are unable to fill orders because the
railway is practically tied up by a
snow blockade.
At Tulsa, I. T., where a temperature
of 7 below zero is reported, work in
the oil and gas fields has been stopped
and railroad traffic interrupted.
IX ROCKY MOUNTAIN STATES.
Even Southern New Mexico Boasts of
Zero Temperature.
DENVER, Feb. 12.â Reports of in
tense cold, accompanied in some sec
tions by snowball, were received at the
office of the local Weather Bureau to
night from Colorado, Wyoming ana
New Mexico. In Southern Colorado
and Northern New Mexico the worst
storm since 1886 is raging, according
to dispatches from Trinidad. In New
Mexico the storm reached the propor
tions of a blizzard and great damage
to stock is reported. Railroad men re
port the tracks along the Southern and
Colorado strewn with carcasses of dead
sheep and cattle.
In the southern part of New Mexico,
where cold weather is a rarity, the zero
mark was reached at certain points.
The cold snap which has prevailed
on the eastern slope of the mountains
in Colorado for several days became
intense last night, the thermometer
dropping to 27 below zero in Denver
at 6 o'clock this morning. The cold
also penetrated the western slope to
night and Teliuride reports 20 below.
At Fort Collins, in the northern sec
tion of Colorado, 22 degrees below zero
was registered to-day and at Monu
ment, on the divide north of Colorado
Springs, it was 26 below. At Twin
Lakes, near Leadville, 32 below was
reached.
In Wyoming the cold has not abated
and much loss to livestock, it is feared,
will result. Railroad traffic in all di
rections is seriously impeded and tele
graph and telephone wires are being
snapped by the cold.
Two Austrian miners lost their lives
to-day in a snowslide at Irene, seven
miles from Silverton, Colo. They were
snowshoeing on the mountain side
when an avalanche swooped -down
upon them, burying them deep in the
snow. An effort is being made to re
cover the bodies of the victims.
TRAINS STALLED IN NEBRASKA.
Imprisoned Passengers Are Without
Food For Eleven Hours.
OMAHA, Nebr., Feb. 12. â Sixteen
degrees below zero was recorded here
to-night, with a prospect for lower
temperature before morning. Reports
from over Nebraska and Western
lowa indicate a similar severe condi
tion of temperature.
Railway trains in all directions have
been badly delayed. Westbound Bur
lington passenger train No. 42 wag
stuck in the drifts near Seward, Nebr.,
for eleven hours. The passengers in
many instances were without food.
Later the trains were sent back to Lin
coln, headed by a snowplow.
Near Creston, lowa, a passenger
train drawn by two engines on the
Burlington road was derailed. Engi
neer Allen of Lincoln, Nebr., was
killed and four members of the crew
were scalded. The passenger coaches
did not leave the rails and no pas
sengers were injured.
GREAT ICE FIELD BREAKING.
Rise In Temperature Releases Schoon
ers at Vineyard Haven.
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass., Feb.
12. â The expected break-up of the
great ice field at the mouth of the
harbor, in which nine schooners had
been held fast for more than two
weeks, began at 1 o'clock this morn
ing, when a portion of the field broke
away and carried ashore the British
schooner Greta from New London.
Conn., to St. John. N. B. All the
wharves on the west side of the har
bor, with the exception of the steam
ship wharf, were demolished.
At 2 o'clock a high southerly gale
prevailed, with considerably warmer
weather, and it was expected that the
balance of the field with other ice
bound schooners would start.
SHIPS LOST IX ICE.
Break-Up on Ohio River Causes
Widespread Damage.
CINCINNATI, Feb. 12. â Half a
million dollars' worth a? river prop
erty was placed in jeoparay, one steam
ship carried down the river in the ice,
150 barges torn loose and sent down
the river and several other steam
ships seriously damaged to-day from
the break-up of the ice gorges at this
point in the Ohio River. The steam
ship New South, one of the best
boats on the river, was torn from her
moorings and carried down the river
In the ice. She is lodged in the ice
pack and may prove a total loss.
A rise of ten feet in the river, which
â was caused during the day by the re
gorging of ice at some point farther
down, forced the steamship Bonan
za out of the water on to the shore
near the foot of Main street, where
where she is in a bad position.
WILD RIDE OX ICE.
Seven Persotas on Barges Swept Down
East River.
NEW YORK, Feb. 12.â After a peril
ous, swift and enforced ride of more
than three-quarters of a mile down the
East River on a huge ice floe to-night,
seven persons, including women and
children, were rescued by a municipal
vessel.
The floe, which stretched from North
Brother Island to the Bronx shore,
drifted down the river with the tide
and in its passage tore from their
moorings the James D. Perkins and
the Eureka, two coal barges which had
been fastened to the pier at One Hun
dred and Thirty-ninth street. On the
Perkins were Captain Henry Flood, his
wife and little daughter. Captain John
Kratzner of the Eureka had on board
his wife and two sons/
During their dangerous experience a
heavy rain fell, the river was a torrent
and the barges were surrounded by the
noe which was headed toward Hell
Gate.
As the barges were loaded with coal
to within a few feet of their decks, the
ice became piled on them to such an
extent that several times one of them
nearly capsized. When the hawsers
parted the women and children were
panic-stricken. The men buckled life
preservers on the women and children
and waved red lanterns while they
shouted for help.
Ice was forced up on top of the
barges so fast that the men were kept
busy pushing back the large cakes to
prevent the two craft from overturn
ing. The captain of the steamer
Franklin Edson of the Department of
Charities and Corrections became
aware of the barges' predicament, and,
ordering full steam ahead, forced his
vessel through the ice to the aid of
the endangered occupants. After
great effort the Edson tied up along
side the barges and the women and
children were taken aboard.
CRAZED BY THE COLD.
Man Found Wandering on Prairie
With His Eyes Frozen Shut.
TANKTON, S. D., Feb. 12.â Anton
Krempge, a tragedian, while walking
across the prairie near here yesterday
was caught by the fierce blizzard and
had a narrow escape from death.
Krempge set out on foot from the town
of Epiphany to fulfill an engagement
at a town about four miles distant, not
withstanding that the mercury stood at
IB degrees below zero and there was a
high northwest wind. He wore a slouch
hat, with no protection for his ears,
was without an overcoat, had no cov
ering for his hands but a light Dair of
mittens and carried a satchel.
At sundown he was seen by two
farmers running around in a circle. At
tracted by the peculiar antics of the
stranger, they went to him and discov
ered that he evidently was half-frozen
and entirely out of his mind. The cold
wind had made the tears run down
Krempge's face and the intense cold had
frozen the tears over his eyes, which
were closed tight by the ice thus
formed. As he could not see he lost the
road and had been wandering helplessly
for hours. The farmers bundled him
into their wagon and took him to their
home, where they finally succeeded in
thawing him out. Although he had re
covered consciousness his reason had
apparently left him, and he lies in bed.
at intervals calling for help and ex
claiming that he was being buried alive
in a snowdrift.

ALBANY, N. V., Feb. 13. -Attorney
General Mayer to-night made public
the report of Tracy C. Becker of Buf

General, investigated the insolvency or
the German Bank of Buffalo.
The bank, according to the report of
Becker, passed into the control of Ar
thur E. Appleyard of Boston on April
30, 1904. Appleyard la said to hayÂ«
been the promoter of steam and elec
tric railway corporations operating
about Dayton and cdlumbua, 0., and
is alleged to have obtained control of
banks In New Jersey and Pennsylvania
before acquiring the stock in the Buf

German Bank stock Appleyard is said
to have borrowed money in large quan
tities from the bank. Jt is allege**

interests were indebted to It la the
sum of more than $662,000.
These loans, discounts and drafts ot
Appleyard and his corporations, it wu
represented, were secured In part by
bonds of several railway companies.
Since the failure of the bank nearly
all these companies hayÂ« been placed
in the hands of receivers and ths se
curities are alleged to bÂ» practically
worthless.
The bank on April 80, 1004, had
$6,000,000 in deposits. It paid 4 pÂ«r
cent on deposits and consequently at
tracted the savings of thousands of
depositors.
Three of the directors, said to bÂ»
under Appleyard's influence, urn
charged with willfully failing tÂ« per
form their duties as directors.

Oakland, Feb. 12.â The funeral

The friends of Mr. Evers filled the big
church, and there were so many floral

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALE, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1905.
AIRSHIP FALLS
INTO THE BAY
The California Messenger
Drops Into the Water
Off the Key Route Pier
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 12.
Helpless In the grasp of a strong
wind, with its motor broken down and
useless, the airship California Messen
ger, in charge of George E. Heaton, Its
inventor and builder, was driven out
over the bay this afternoon, and being
tilted by a sharp gust of air suddenly
lost its balance and dropped stern first
into the water.
The navigator of the airship managed
to escape being caught in the cordage
of the big gas bag. He swam to the
Key Route pier, near which the acci
dent happened, escaping with nothing
worse than a ducking and a shaking
up. The airship was later raised from
the water and towed to the shore. It
was afterward taken to Idora Park,
from which Heaton started to-day on
the trip which ended in the waters of
the bay.
The California Messenger was built
in East Oakland by Heaton, who is
backed by a company incorporated in
San Francisco. After a number of tests
the machine was removed to Idora
Park and preparations were made for
an ascension this afternoon. On ac
count of the high wind Heaton was ad
vised to postpone the flight, but at 4
o'clock he decided to take chances with
the breeze, and getting ready ordered
the airship released.
The airship had barely raised above
the tree tops when the motor went
wrong and the ship at once began to
drift in the wind. Heaton, falling to
start his engine, landed at the race
track, and after repairing the motor
ascended once more, but again the mo
tor broke down, and then came the
plunge Into the waters of the bay.
Heaton gave the following account of
the accident:
I had just put a new engine Into the Mes
senger, and the trouble to-day was caused
principally by the failure of thin motor at a
critical time and also by our failure to set the
new motor In exactly the right place, it was
too near the stern of the ship, and after I had
been up for a few moments I found that â¢ the
bow was being tilted up. The only way* I could
get the airship balanced was by discarding
some of the ballast, and this made the Mes
senger so light that it was hard to handle her
After I had repaired the engine, when it
first broke down, I thought I had the ship
correctly balanced, but after I get up I found
that the bow was still high, so I had to let
out tome ga*. T*en the motor broke down
again, and while iVas trying to get the ship
under control she drifted out over the bey
The wind was blowing in gusts. Suddenly
the ship was caught In a sharp puff and fell
The airship Is not much damaged however'
and I was not hurt. As soon an I can get the
Messenger In shape a*aln I shall make an
other ascent.

CITIZENS TAKE
HIND IN CHASE
They Round Up Large Gang
of Fugitives Supposed to
Be Band of Pickpockets
WORK ON LOCAL TRAIN
Stranger From St. Louis De
clares That His Money Was
Filched by Deft Fingers
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 12.
Three out of four of a gang of ac
cused pickpockets from San Francisco
were captured this morning by officers
and citizens after a hot pursuit and
battle in the vicinity of Oak street
station on the Southern Pacific Seventh
street local train route. The crowd
had, it is charged, niched money from
the pockets of J. D. Inlow, a stranger
from St. Louis, while he and his
daughter. Miss Era Inlow, were about
to leave the train when It arrived at
the station.
The men under arrest gave the
names of George Thompson, 25 years
old, a bartender; Morris Murphy, 27
years of age, a bartender, and Albert
J. Norton, a cigar dealer, 37 years old.
Inlow and His daughter had come to
Oakland from San Francisco to go to
1705 Broadway, the residence of Miss
Mary Inlow, another daughter. They
went beyond the station and were ap
proaching Oak street when they dis
covered their mistake. Their inquiries
attracted attention from other passen
gers, who also noticed the four men
who crowded around Inlow and the
young woman. Before the pair left the
train Inlow missed his money, $12 or
US.
The quartet's suspicious actions
aroused him and he called for the po
lice. The four separated and started
to run. Thompson and his companion
were pursued by W. D. McDonald of
114 Fifth street, who captured Thomp
son. Murphy and Norton were caught
by Deputy Sheriff W. J. Moffitt and
W. W. Prince of 117 Eighth street at
Tenth and Oak streets. Gus Miller of
1026 Folsom street, San Francisco,
identified the trio at the City Prison
as three of the men who were on the
train. They were charged with grand
larceny. The police found a $10 gold
piece, hidden in Thompson's clothing.
He had dropped it down his back.
The police suspect that their pris
oners are from the East, and that they
have been trailing Inlow for several
days, thinking he had a large amount
of money. It is said the men had fol
lowed the Inlows from Los Angeles.
Detectives were detailed to investigate
the trio in the hope of uncovering their
identity and past.

W. L. Flnley of the class of '03 is achieving
fame in the Eawt, apparently, as a naturalist
and writer of nature storlfis. Finley has been
made a staff writer for a new magazine of the
Review or Reviews Company. FinlÂ«y deals
principally with bird life in his stories and pic
tures. He has t;;ken more than 1200 pictures
of bird life on the coast, most of these photo
graphs having been secured during his Under
graduate days. Hia collection includes both sea
and land birds-, ranging from the eagle to tho
humming bird in full flight. John Burroughs,
the famous naturallHt, has pronounced Flnley's
collection to be "the most complete, both in
scientific and artistic values, I have ever Been."

FEW CONTESTS
IN CITY FIGHT
Parties Have Generally In
dorsed the Same Candidates
in the Oakland Election
REPUBLICANS TO ISIEET
Sanguine of Success With
Every Nominee From the
Mayor to Library Trustees
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Feb. 13.
The actual municipal campaign will
begrin during the coming week. The
Republican City Central Committee
will hold a meeting to-morrow night at
the old headquarters of Frank K. Mott
In the Canning Block on the corner of
Broadway and Thirteenth street,
where all the candidates will appear
before the committee and make sugges
tions as to what they think should be
done between now and election time.
It is probable there will be a meeting
or two in each ward, but the candidates
will generally make a personal fight,
though, at the same time, working for
a straight ticket.
There has been a general shakedown
of nominations during the week, some
of the candidates named by the differ
ent conventions having declined to run.
Lowell J. Hardy refused the nomina
tion for School Director and asked the
Democratic City Committee to drop
his name. The other conventions
understood that Mr. Hardy would not
again be a candidate and the Demo
crats have placed Richard Wiand on
their ticket. A. K. Munson has also
notified the Democratic City Commit
tee that he cannot be a candidate for
Councilman at large. H. T. Burns, the
Republican and Municipal League
nominee, has taken his place. War
ren Olney Jr. has refuged the Demo
cratic nomination for School Director
in the Fourth Ward and G. J. W.
Stark, the Municipal League nominee,
has been placed upon that ticket in his
place.
The Union Labor Party filled some
vacancies upon its ticket generally by
indorsing the Republican nominees for
the same positions. They have named
the tmtire Republican Board of Library
Trustees. In the Second Ward they
have named R. M. Hamb for Council
man and J. G. Hanks for School Direc
tor, and in the Fifth Ward they have
indorsed the Republican nominee, B.
H. Pcndleton.
The Socialists had to make one
change in their ticket. Austin Lewis,
who was nominated for City Attorney,
withdrew and J. W. O'Connor was sub
stituted.
This reduces the situation to simple
proportions, and tneans practically a
sweep for the Republican ticket. The
Socialists and Prohibitionists have put
up straight party tickets, but their vote
has always been small. The Republi
can, Municipal League and Democratic
tickets are substantially the same and
even the Union tabor Party has but
few nominees of its own. Practically
the only fights among the general nom
inees are that between Abe P. Leach,
the Republican nominee for City At
torney, and J. E. McElroy, who holds
the Democratic, Municipal League and
Union Labor nominations for the same
place: and for the contest for Treas
urer, In which Charles D. Bates Jr. has
the Republican " â¢â¢" 'nation, David E.
Bortree the Democratic and Municipal
League nominations and Murray Laid
law the Union Labor support. For
Councllmen at large the Republican
nominees have nearly every one of
them the indorsement of all parties,
and among the ward Councllmen there
are only two contest, that between E.
C. Hahn, Republican, in the Fourth
Ward, against R. W. Bahls with the
Municipal League and Democratic sup
port and John F. Teague nn the Union
Labor ticket; and In the Seventh Ward
where W. A. Donaldson has the Re
publican and Union Labor support
against J. T. Wallace with the Demo
cratic and Municipal League.
The Republicans of the First Ward
have organized a club with the follow
ing officers: Thomas M. Robinson,
president; J. H. Mahon, vice president,
and C. A. Kllnkner, secretary.
FOLLOWS SON
TO THE GRAVE
Mrs. Elizabeth Camp of Ala
meda Grieves to Death
Over the Loss of Her Boy
ALAMEDA, Feb. 12.â Grief over the
Budden death of her only son has
brought the gray hairs of Mrs. S. J.
Elizabeth Camp to the grave, and the
aged woman succumbed to death last
night at her home, 647 Central avenue.
On January 26 Silas W. Camp, young
and apparently In perfect health, bade
his parents a cheery good-bye and, as
was his regular custom, left for his
place of employment in the roasting
department of Jones, Paddock & Co. of
Ban Francisco. An hour later, without
warning, he toppled over dead, heart
failure being the cause, though the
young man had never suspected he was
troubled with thlÃ affection.
Between the mother and son there
was even more than the usual affec
tion, and for a time relatives feared to
tell the mother of her son's death. Fin
ally the news was broken to her as
gently as possible. The aged woman
bore up well until after the funeral.
Then she collapsed. A slight cold ap
peared to have been aggravated and
the bereaved mother sank to the end,
despite ministrations of friends and
physicians.
Mrs. Camp is survived by her hus
band, T. Edson Camp, and a daughter,
Miss Bessie Camp. She was a native
of New York and 67 year's old. The
funeral will be held from the residence
at 1 o'clock Tuesday afternoon. The
remains will be Incinerated at the Oak
land Crematory.
Charged With Attempt to Rob.
Three young men, Ed. Burke.
George O'Brien and "Niftty" Cassidy,
are oharged by Timothy O'Keefe of
2981 Twenty-third street with at
tempting to rob him on Saturday
night last. The affair was reported
to Lieutenant Price of the Mission
Btation, who detailed Policemen Fitz
gerald, Graham Â«nd Doran on the
case. Their investigation led to the
arrest of O'Brien and Cassidy, who
were locked up on the charge of an
attempt to rob. Burke will be arrested
if found.

REFUGE AT SAN PEDRO.
ESSEL IS TWICE
VICTIM OF ELEMENTS
The bark Holliswood is in more
trouble and once again has sought ref
uge from the anger of the elements at
San Pedro. She left here January 20
for New York. She put into San Pe
dro yesterday in distress. Her fore
digging had been carried away and she
had suffered the loss of some yards
and a number of sails. Heavy weather
has prevailed along the coast since the
Holliswood left here and many vessels
have reported encounters with gales
more or less severe, but the Hollie
wood, of all the storm-battered fleet,
la the only one that suffered to any
serious extent.
The Holliswood, in command of Cap
tain Warren, left here January 20 with
a cargo of asp halt urn. the first cargo
of its kind ever taken from this port.
She has 6504 barrels of it stowed in her
hold.
The Holliawood came to this port
about nine months ago badly crippled.
Bound from Newcastle, Australia,
for San Francisco in command of Cap
tain Knight she encountered bad
weather and lost spars, sails and rig
ging. She was spoken at sea, and the
report of her crippled condition
reached here several days before she
went limping into San Pedro, where
she is now. She was towed here and
after being repaired was chartered for
her present voyage. She probably will
return to this port for repairs.
Ijaunch Was Not There.
E. E. Berens. a civilian employe of Uncle
Sam at thÂ« Mara Island navy-yard, started
out yesterday to visit come old shipmates on
the battleship Ohio. He bought transporta
tion on one of Crowley's launches. Down the
gangway to the boat landing he walked and
on board the launch he would nave stepped
had no; two pretty Vallejo Â«irlÂ» happened to
pass along the Mission-street bulkhead.
Kerens' gaze followed the young women until
they disappeared over the horlron. While
Berens watched the girls the launch got under
way. and by the time the fair pair had dis
appeared the launch was choo-chooing its
way to the Ohio. With a final glance girl
ward Berens stepped out to where the launch
had been. As he came to the surface the
second time Dr. Kucich of the Harbor Hos
pital stall reached the wet .and spluttering
Berens with a boathook and held him until
a rope was secured. The waterlogged gazer
was hauled to the bulkhead and taken to the
Harbor Hospital, where he spent the afternoon
sleeping while his clothes dried.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, MOXDAY. FEBRUARY 13. 1905.
WEBER WILL
WRITE A BOOK
Such Are His Intentions
Provided Plans Are Not
Interfered With by Jury
END < IK TRIAL IS NEAR
It Is Believed Fate of the
Accused Will Be Decided
on Next Saturday Night
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Feb. 12.â Adoiph Weber,
the Auburn youth who is resting under
the terrible charge that he murdered
his father, mother, sister and little
brother, and who for the last ten days
has been on trial on the charge of slay
ing his mother. Is going to write a
bock. He is spending his spare time
in arranging his data and shaping his
ideas. Just when the book will be pub
lished is not known. The twelve men
who are hearing day after day the de
tails of the horrible Weber tragedy
probably will have something to say
about the date of publication.
Weber spent all of to-day in making
notes for his prospective novel. He re
fuses to discuss his plans for the book
or to tell along what lines it will be
written. It is generally known, how
ever, that the author expects to dazzle
the world with his literary style and
display of originality.
It is expected that the prosecution in
the Weber case will have all its evi
dence in by to-morrow night. A num
ber of witnesses are yet to be called
by the prosecution, but it is thought
ihrt the taking of their testimony will
not require a great length of time. The
defense has a number of witnesses here
awaiting a summons to the stand. Sev
eral days will be required to examine
them. Judge Prewett is aware that
the trial of Weber Is proving an ex
pensive one and is therefore anxious to
bring it to a close as soon as possible.
He stated to-day that he would as far
as it lay in his power push the case to
a speedy termination. It is believed
the case v. ill go to the jury Saturday
night.
Detective W. G. Green, employed by
the defense, arrived in town to-night,
as did also Lottie Smith, the woman
upon whom the defense depends to de
stroy the value of the testimony of
May Clark, whose evidence regarding
Adoiph Weber's movements on the
night of the trial flatly contradicts that
yriven by the prisoner before the Cor
oner's jury and at his preliminary hear
ing.
PRESIDENT WILL SPEND

House.
On Tuesday the President will visit
friends and relatives, attend a lunch
eon at the University Club and a din
ner at the Hungarian Republican Club.
The Hungarian Club entertained
Roosevelt when he was Governor of

ise, made in fun, will thus be kept in
earnest. He will depart at midnight
on Tuesday for Washington.

SWATHE IMPEACHMENT CASE
WILL OCCUPY THE SENATE
Naval Appropriation Bill to be Main
Topic of Discussion i n the
House.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â The ac
tion of the Senate during the present
week will bo divided between the
Bwayne impeachment and the agri
cultural appropriation bill. The bill
is still under discussion and as soon
as it is disposed of the bill making
appropriations for the District of Co
lumbia will be t:iken up.
The naval appropriation bill will be
taken up by the House on Monday as
soon ;;s tbe legislation for the District
of Columbia has been disposed of. The
naval bill will be attacked on several
grounds, issue is to be taken with
the committee In its provision for new
ships. The topic for armor plate con
tracts is to fill its accustomed place on
ihe programme. while submarine
boats and tornedo boats are to form
the basis of offensive and defensive
argument. The best estimate that can
be made is that at least four days will
be consumed in getting legislative ac
tion on this bill in the House.
It is to be followed immediately by
the river and harbor bill. Should the
decks be clearp^ at any time during
the week, the proposed legislation on
the Panama canal project will be dis
cussed.

FIRE DESTROYS
A SKYSCRAPER
Flames En in an Eight-Story
Building in Seattle and
Cause a Loss of $400,000
<>\Y.\ Kits MILL REBUILD:
Daring Conflagration Lives:
Are Endangered by the Ex- !
plosion of Ammunition
SEATTLE. Feb. 12.â Fire destroyed |
the eight-story building of the Schwa
bacher Hardware Company at Jack
son street and First avenue South i
early this morning. The entire build- |
ing was gutted and the walls par
tially destroyed.
After the flames readied the pack-f
ing-rooms on the third floor hundreds j
of loaded cartridges began to explode
and the firemen were unable to ap- j
proach within fighting distance. There i
were several explosions of giant pow- {
der, but no one was hurt. It is be
lieved the fire was caused by crossed ;
electric wires.
The building had just been com- |
pleted and the hardware company had I
moved into it practically all its stock.
The building itself was what is known
as fire-proof and was erected at a cost '
of $150,000.

XKW APPOINTMENT GIVEN
TO THE PRIXCE OF WALES
Made Lord Wards* of the Cinque
Ports of England to Suc
ceed Ciirzon.
LONDON', Feb. 12. â King Edward
has appointed the Prince of Wales

er and Sandwich were the original
ports, Wlnchelea and Rye were added
later. The Cinque ports were created
by William the Conqueror and in con
sideration of thojr furnishing a certain
: quota of ships of war for the King's
use when demanded were endowed
with various privileges.
MONETARY OUTLOOK
BRIGHT IN LONDON
Heavy Baying of Consols and Govern
ment Securities Feature of
the WeeU.
LONDON, Feb. 12. â The Stock Ex
change, although quiet last week, dis
played considerable firmness, due to
the monetary outlook. Money prom
ises to be easy in the near future, as
there is less competition in the mar
kets for gold, thus enabling the Bank
of England to increase its already
huge reserve.
The feature of the week was the
considerable investment in consols and
Government securities. The expecta
tion in many quarters of peace in the
Far East gave a fresh incentive to
operations on the bull side. The re
cently increased demands for Japan
ese securities is attributed to these
rumors. American stocks continued
firm, but buying was somewhat re
stricted.

MARBLE STEPS
Young Philadelphian Steers
.Machine Dp a Perilous
Incline to Win a Wager
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 12.â Members
of the Mercantile Club were astonished
to see a sixteen- horsepower touring
automobile going up the front steps
of their clubhouse at Broad and Mas
ter streets on Saturday afternoon. The
incident was the culmination of a
wager and furnished amusement for a
number of wealthy young Phtladel
phians.
"I'll bet you an automobile just like
mine against $1500 that I can climb the
Mercantile Club steps," said Carl Kel
fry.
"I'll take it," said Nathan Folwell Jr.
A few minutes later Kelfry reap
peared with his slxteen-horsepower
louring car. He steered due west, ap
plied the power and the machine leaped
the curb, shot across the pavement and
climbed the marble steps.
Several members of the club who
were at the windows snouted indig
nantly to the automobilist that the
clubhouse was no garage and that the
young autoist had better watch out or
the police would get him. Then en
sued calls for the police. Kelfry
quickly backed his machine down the
steps to the street and sped away.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
JOHN D. SPRECTTEIiS .Proprietor
1 ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN McXAUGHT .Manager
I VBUCATIONOFFICB THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. BAN FRANCISCO
MONDAY FEBRUARY IS, 1905
BUSINESS APPARENTLY AGAIN EXPANDING.
BUSINESS was better again last week, as far as the East was
concerned, with a visible expansion in the spring distributive
demand, which usually appears about this time of the year, but
la Francisco there was an equally visible halt in general trade.
Diligent inquiry among the large and small mercantile interests alike
failed to elicit any particular cause for this lull, except the general
and unsatisfactory statement, which is no reason at all, that there
was very little call for goods. This local halt applied to almost every
branch of trade,* including the different kinds of farm produce, such
U srain, hay and fruits, provisions, cattle, sheep and hogs and their
nets, dairy products, general merchandise, etc. It was just such
a lull as was noted in the reports from the East ten days ago.
But the halt in the East is apparently already being succeeded
by a better demand for goods, and the halt in our local market may
be equally transitory. The iron and steel trade is sending in most
excellent reports, the booked orders for steel rails alone exceeding a
million tons, while those for structural material and other forms of
the finished product are sufficient to keep the mills running for some
months yet. In fact, iron statistics are showing the heaviest produc
tion and consumption ever reported, if we arc to believe the state
ments mrdr to the different commercial agencies receiving these re-
The bank clearings at Pittsburg affirm these re
bcinp 31.3 per cent larger than during the corresponding week
04. The clearings for the whole country last week were 33.5
per cent larger than last year, and amounted in the aggregate to
5_'.70j.000.000, with St. Louis and New Orleans the only cities of
first importance exhibiting a loss. That at New Orleans was quite
large, being 5&9 per cent, and is explained by the general holding
back of cotton by the planters, whereas last year at this time there
was a heavy movement in cotton there. Boston. Chicago, Philadel
phia and Baltimore all show large gains over 1904, the increase at
important points of distribution indicating improved activity
in general trade. Considering the recent inclement weather, which
through freezing temperatures and snowstorms over a wide area
checked the demand for spring goods and seriously hampered rail
and wheel traffic, this exhibit is an excellent one and speaks well for
the condition of trade.
There is not much new as far as the staples are concerned. Pro
â mewhat firmer in the West, but business is not especi
ally active. Sugar has taken a turn downward, and coffee, after a pe
riod of activity, is quieter. Hides are steady, in sympathy with a re
â >ansion in the demand for leather, and offerings of foreign
hides are readily absorbed. The footwear factories of New England
jontinue to send in cheerful report?, and the textile mills of the whole
Atlantic seaboard report an active inquiry for winter apparel of
various kinds, owing to the cold weather. There is also a better
feeling in lumber at many points. The railroad earnings are about
<Â» per cent larger than at this time last year. The failures last week
were 2><k against 228 last year, but they were all comparatively
small and unimportant, none being sufficiently large to attract atten
tion. Tl me complaint of tardy collections in the Stormy
/one. but these are probably incidental to the recent severe weather
and will disappear with warmer temperatures.
Money continues phenomenally easy and in enormous supply.
There is not a section in the United States, not excepting the South,
where thr depression in cotton has checked distributive trade more
<>r less, which reports ajiv shortage in funds. It is this surprising
abundance of money everywhere which keeps confidence in the future
the level of sanguine anticipation. The feeling in Wall street
I bullish, to such a degree that a disposition to plunge again
is tin coming visible. But dispatches from New York say
ihat the bankers will promptly repress any attempts in this direction.
The nation's stock market, they say, is now in a stable and health y
condition, and they propose to keep it so. which is a wise proceeding
on their part. In pursuance of this policy they have during the past
several days notified a clique of rich Westerners who were about to
create a speculative boom in Wall street to keep their hands off the
market unless they can operate with conservatism.
For the rest the country seems to be in excellent condition from
one end to the other. The different crops are reported looking well
everywhere, prices are still high, labor is fully employed in all sec
tions, and there are no disquieting signs anywhere.. Good times are
still with us.
CIVIL SERVICE IN THE PHILIPPINES.
FROM the fourth annual report of the Philippine Civil Service 1
Board, recently submitted to the Governor of the islands, very
satisfactory deductions concerning the nature of the service
can be made. Not only does the board note the fact that increasing
numbers of the Filipinos are qualifying for positions under the dis
pensation of the service, but it calls attention to the very general
excellence of the work performed by the natives in the various
offices open to competitive examination. More Filipino officials and
er Americans is the ideal of the civil service personnel toward
which the board is working.
During the nine months covered by this last report 106} of the
-443 applicants who entered the examinations given in English
were Filipinos, a greater number than in any year since examina
tions were fir<t opened to the islanders. Because of the larger num
ber of natives taking the recent examinations the percentage of all
who passed (natives and Americans) was lower than that of the
previous year: 45 per cent attained eligible ratings, as contrasted
with 63 per cent of the more preponderant American eligibles of last
year. That the intelligent Filipinos are endeavoring to overcome
the chief obstacle to office tenure, knowledge of the English
anguage. the Civil Service Board is assured. It furthermore be
lieves that the best results will be forthcoming in the end if it refuses
relax the hig;h standard of scholarship now demanded of Filipino
and American alike.
It is a sinister commentary upon the integrity of some Ameri
cans in the government service of the islands that, as the board says
Hie records show that the separation from the service of Ameri
cans occasioned directly and indirectly by insobriety and other ex
it not infrequent, while the separation of Filipinos for similar
causes ,s rare. This would seem to indicate that for the steadiness
and integrity of the Filipino government servants we have not to
fear as much as for those of some of the least reliable of our own
blood.

REV. MECCA M. VARNEY AND HER SON.
Twentieth Century Madonna" is the title given the portrait of Rev.
I Mecca Marie Varney and her son Charles, which appeals above. Rev.
Mrs. Varney is from Clinton, 111., and is the State superintendent of
the franchise department of work of the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, says the Chicago Chronicle. Although she is young, Mrs. Varney
has easily won for herself a first place among the lecturers of to-day. Per
sonally she is a charming woman, and her lectures are forceful and logical.
MIKADO'S BILL OF FARE
The Japanese Emperor's yearly ex
pense of living it limited. For this pur
pose he draws 53.000,000 from the na
tional treasury. His personal wealth is
not to be spent on hi? own living, so
that $3,000,000 is? really his salary as
manager of the country. He is required
to pay out of it some thousand em
ployes.
The Emperor's daily fare is Japa
nese. He is perfectly satisfied for break
fast with a bowl of bean soup and a
few other dishes. But his dinner usu
ally appears in splendid style, in some
twenty courses, although he always de
nounces it as a useless extravagance.
When any official feast is heldâ the
cherry blosÃom viewing party at the
Kloshikawa botanical garden or the
chrysanthemum party at the Akasaka
palace, for instance â he will not spare
any expense in preparing an elegant
European banquet.

an occasion. She is a noted economist.

you each to bring in a little verse that
you have made yourselves about the

anything that pleases you."
Various specimens were produced

"See the pretty gold fish swimming in

REAL SEII-CONTROL.
To most people self-control means
the control of appearances, and not the
control of realities. This Is a radical
mistake and must be corrected if we
are to get a clear idea of self-control
and if we are to make a fair start in
acquiring it as a permanent habit.
If a man is ugly to me and I want to
knock him down, and refrain from do
ing so simply because it would not ap
pear well and is not the habit of the
people about me, my desire to knock
him down is still a part of myself, and
I have not controlled myself until I am
absolutely free from that interior de
sire. So long as I am in hatred to an
other I am in bondage to my hatred,
and if, for the sake of appearances, 1
do not act or speak from it, I am none
the less at its mercy, and it will find an
outlet wherever it can do so without
debasing me in the eyes of other men
more willing than I am to be debased.
My selfl&h desire to injure the man I
hate is counterbalanced by my selfish
desire to stand well in the eyes of other
men. There can be no true self-control
so long as either form of selfishness
dominates my actions. The control of
appearances is merely outward repres
sion, and a very common instance ot
this may be observed in the effort to
control a laugh. â Annie Payson Call, in
Leslie's Magazine.

OLD LOVE CAN BE OUTGROWN
Advice to a Young Girl Menaced by Attentions

DOROTHY FENIMORE
I HAVE been asked for advice by a
young girl who is in love with a
married man who has told her that
he loves her better than he does his
wife. Her love has gained such a
held upon her mind and heart, she
writes, that she is bewildered, and does
not know what she ought to do.
If what I am about to say seems hard
to her, I hope that she will remember
that nevertheless I speak as one sister
might speak to another, with sympathy
and tenderness, and with a. great de
sire to save her from the suffering
which comes of dishonor and remorse.
There is only one way that a girl so
situated can keep her self-respect, and
A WOMAN'S LOVE.
A sentinel angel, sitting high in glory,
; Heard this shrill wail ring out from Pur

"Have mercy, mighty angel, hear my

"I loved â and. blind with passionate
love, I fell.
Love brought me down to death, and
death to hell:
For God is Just, and death for sin is well.
"I do not rage against his high decree,
Nor for myself do ask that grace shall
be;
But for my love on earth who mourns
for me.
"Great Spirit! let me see my love again
And comfort him one hour, and I were
fain
To pay a thousand years of flre and
pain."
Then said the pitying angel, "Nay. re
pent
Th;*t wild vow! Look, the dial-finger's
bent
Down to the last hour of thy punish
ment!"
But Â«till she wailed. "I pray thee, let me

I cannot rise to peace and leave him so.
O, lt-t m<? soothe him in his bitter woe!"
The brazen g.ites ground sullenly ajar,
And upward, joyous, like a rising star.
She rose and vanished in the ether far.
But soon adown the dying sunset sailing.
And like a wounded bird her pinions
trailing.
She fluttortd back, with broken-hearted
wailing.
She sobbed. "I found him by the summer
sea
Reclined, his head upon a maiden's
knee â
She curled his hair and kissed him. Woe
is me!"
She wept. "Now let my punishment be
gin!
I have been fond and foolish. Let me in
To expiate my sorrow and my sin.""
The angel answered. "Nay, sad aoul, go

SOCIALISMâ W. M.. iJanta Rota. ral.
Socialism is a term denoting a class a 4
opinions opposed to the present an<l
historical organization of society and
seeking to introduce a new diatributum
of property and labor, in which organ
ized co-operation, rather than competi
tion, should be the dominating prir
under the conviction that the happiness
of the race, and especially of th â¢
classes without capital, would be pro
cured or greatly advanced thereby.
Communism is a term to designate a
state of things in whlcbi no separate
rights of property exist, all property
and substance being held in common;
communism designates one class of the
arrangement by which certain t.
ists have proposed to dispense with
those laws of social and political econo
my which are supposed to keep society
together through the influence of thÂ«
domestic affection and the spirit of
competition, and substitute in their
stead a set af artificial rules for the
government of human society. Th>
wnril socialist has generally been ap
plied to thoae who only propose to in
terfere with labor by abolishing
petition in wages, leaving ma
under the influence of public spiri:
making an equal division of the pro

The fourth annual convention of the
< California Federation of Women's
<'lubs has passed into history.
Like all phrases of history it has its
Jigrhts and its shadows, its tragedies
and its comedies. But the consensus of
opinion isâ among the delegations from
the northâ the comedy leads. In
ihe southland the classification is yet
in the air; but I doubt not that a laugh
is on every lip, now that the thing is
over â  nd done.

Mrs. George Law Smith; the corre
sponding secretary, Mrs. Arthur Corn

MacClouth of San Jose, and the rest of
the northern delegations (numbering"
about 300) reached Los Angeles at the
dismal hour of 2:30 a, m., the rains of
Sunday night having caused terrific
washouts on the road and necessitating
a crawling, pace at the treacherous

Auditorium to formally open the three
days' deliberations.
"A table?" "Oh, yes; we will try
to get you one. A gavel? Why, yes;
but didn't you bring one with you?"
And thus it was that Mrs. Smith,
saved by her unfailing charm, courtesy
and consideration, smilingly stood on
the platform until a table, a gavel (a
child's mallet) and a brass door-plate
upon which to hammer it were pro
vided.
After that things got under way and
a programme of vital interest â a trifle
too much of detail perhaps â was lis
tened to in triple installments, morn
ing, afternoon and evening.
jredly was Mrs. J. W. Orr, San
Francisco, chairman of the programme
committee, to be congratulated upon
her choice of speakers and their sub
jects, albeit about one-half of the val
uable matter offered would have been
better digested. But, of course, every
district and every club clamors for rec
ognition.
These three sessions a day with
each speaker loaded to the nozzle with
specific information is something of a
hard proposition on the delegates if
they hope to listen intelligently. Many
of us found ourselves jibbering idiots
on the third day out. A fourth would
have had us "committed." Fortunately
the fourth didn't happen and we are
back in our happy homes to recuper
ate and reflect.
In this reflection lies the real value
cf State Federation gatherings. Women
from all sections of a big State
come together, tell of their ambitions
and their diversified achievements â
with the latter considerably in the lead
â and the consciousness furnishes an
impetus to further achievement. It
spurs on to bigger things and thus
shapes destinies. In this alone lies
the power and the necessity of feder
ation, which to the woman of door
yard views has no appreciation.
Quite the most significant thing ut
tered by the newly elected State presi
dent, Mrs. Josiah Evans Oowles, in her
inauguration address was in this state
ment: "I am the president of Califor
nia. I know no sections save those di
vided for facility of operation. I ex
pect the loyalty of every sectioiv and
look for its co-operation." A
Of this co-operation there is rio foom
for doubt. i
Mrs. Cowles has in past years shown
herself a woman of marked personality,
of tact, of social accomplishment, nf
quick intelligence and breadth of view.
And in her almost unanimous election
this appreciation has been manifest.
In truth will Mrs. Cowles be presi
dent of California, with the upper part
<>f the big State as loyal and loving
;:s the southern section, which is hon
( red by her residence.
Mrs. George Law Smith, who pre-
Fide'i over the deliberations with such
grace, quite captured the visitors as
well as the southern clubwomen. Firm
in her government, she was none the
less charming and feminine in her per
sonality. There is no suggestion of
the man-woman in either the past pres
ident or the new president, save that
both possess clear and logical minds.
Both are essentially womanly women.
And here's to them!
When the nominations were about to
be made it was a pretty tribute that
every district paid to the retiring preÂ«
identâwhen every district in the State,
through its chairman, requested her
m < ejnanoe of renomination.
While appreciating the pretty com
pliment. Mrs. (ieorpe Law Smith de
clined the honor, stating that the best
interests of the federation were sub-
Kfrved by rotation in office and begged
the chairmen to give their unanimous
support to Mrs. Cowl**, which was
thereupon gladly promised.
Among the reports presented Mrs.
MacClouth's was especially interesting
as recording secretary, going into the
history of the federation and reciting
many pleasant incidents on route in
fine literary fashion.
Kut it remained for Mrs. Arthur
Pill II WII to capture the convention by
her nhort. witty report as correspond

so ponderous that the factotem at the

By way of compensating him she
suggested that he apply for the proper
remedy at A\ ashington.
He did, and got it.
He has it still. And the correspond
ing secretary is to blame for Uncle
Samuels' prodigality.
The best speakers at the conven
tion?
Well, really, Mayor Owen MeAlier
could hardly be mentioned among
them, as he was scared almost into in
sensibility. What he said was all right,
but he dielnf say much. He told some
friends after he left the platform that
he never knew in all his life the true
meaning of "fright" until that awful
day.
We women didn't blame him, with
500 of us staring at him critically. I
think we all thought how our husbands
would look and act in his place. The
comparison helped us to feel kindly
toward him.
I really believe he would refuse re
nomination if he were told that he
would have to address another conven
tion of clubwomen.

week and an army of women is ex
pected to appear against it.
Section 1 of the bill provides that all
marriages hereafter contracted shall
be by written contract entered into
and witnessed before a county Judge,
notary public or Justice of the Peace
in the presence of two witnesses, who
shall append their names to the same.
Before contracting marriage, the prin
cipals must procure a license. The
contracts must be for not less than
three nor more than ten years, but
after six months of wedded bliss a
couple may give up their contract and
contract anew for life. There Is no
objection to an additional ceremony
by a clergyman.
The marriage contracts may specify
which one of the contracting parties
shall be the head of the proposed
family, giving ihe name to the same,
also the surname to children born to
the contracting parties. The con
tracts also may contain an agreement
as to any property which is in pos
session of either party, whether it
shall continue to be held as private
property or be put into a common
stock, and if said marriage contract
be for a limited time, how it shall be
distributed at its termination; also
which of said parties shall take and
hold possession of any child or chil
dren who may be living at the term
ination of the marriage contract.
Townsend has been vigorously de
nounced by several clubs and hun
dreds of women who believe he wants
to establish polygamy. Commenting
upon the bill a local magazine, con
ducted by a well-known woman, asks
that provision be made for polyandry
instead of polygamy.
Townsend says the bill will solve
the divorce evil.
KOSSUTH HAS CONFERENCE
WITH AUSTRIAN EMPEROR
Belirved 'Tint Result Will Be Closer
Kelt tJons Between Oppos
ing Factions.
VIENNA, Feb. 12. â Francis Kos
suth, the leader of the Independence
party in the Hungarian Parliament,
v/as received by the Emperor to-day
and discussed with his Majesty the
political situation and Cabinet crisis in
Hungary, which has arisen from the
coalition of the various minor parties
in Hungary with the Independence
party and the sweeping victory at the
polls on January 26. This gave the
united opposition parties control of
the lower house of the Hungarian Par
liament. Kossuth has declared that it
is impossible now to govern Hungary
without the united opposition party.
He was with his Majesty nearly an
hour and was treated with great dis
tinction. He expressed fully his views
and his partys' views. The Emperor
listened attentively, but did not make
any reply in regard to the situation.
Kossuth's interview with Emperor
Francis Joseph is regarded in Austria
and Hungary as a historical event, be
cause it is believed it will actually lead
to closer relations between the house
of Hapsburg and those Hungarians
v/ho have been opposed to the existing
double form of government.
ANOTHER LARGE GIFT
TO CHICAGO UNIVERSITY
High School Building to Be Provided
for Department of Edu
cation.
CHICAGO, Feb. 12. â Dean W. B.
Owen of the School of Education of
Chicago University is authority for
the announcement of another big en
dowment for a building for a univer
sity high school as part of the Em
mons Blame School of Education.
"The new building will complete the
quad/angle of the School of Educa
tion," said Dean Owen. "The high
school has practically no quarters
now. Its classes are now occupying
quarters which are really part of the
School of Education proper. Although
the school has been open to the pub
lic less than two years, it is over
crowded."
While Dean Owen will not say
where the money is to come from it is
rumored at the university that the
donor will be Mrs. Emmons Blame,
founder of the School of Education.

What is aJÃackache?
IT IS NATURE'S WARNING TO WOMEN
Diseases of Woman's Organism Cared and

Plnkhan't Vegetable Compound
" It seems as though my back would
break." Women utter these words
over and over again, but continue to
drag along and suffer with, aches in the
small of the back, pain low down in
the side,_ ' ' bearing down " pains, nerv-
ousness and no ambition for any task.

They do not realize that the back La
the mainspring of woman's organism,
and quickly indicates by aching a dis-
eased condition of the womb or kid-
neys, and that the aches and pains will
continue until the cause is removed.
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound for twenty years has been the
one and only effective remedy in such
cases. It speedily cures all womb and
kidney disorders and restores the fe-
male organs to a healthy condition.
Here is one case among thousands :
" I consider Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound the most wonderful remedy in the
world for sick women. . For a long time I
suffered with a severe backache and bearing-
down pains : in fact, I had womb trouble.
Reading of the remarkable cures your Com-
pound nod made I decided to try it, and I am
nappy to j say that it not only cured me en-
tirely of t all my troubles but made me a
strong, well woman."â Mrs. Elizabeth H.
Thompson, Lily Dale, N. Y.
No other medicine holds such a record
of cures of female ills as does Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. '
No other person can give such help-
ful advice to women who are sick as
can Mrs. Pinkham, for none have had ;
such a great experience Her address is

STEEL CASTLE
SHIELDS CASTRO
Venezuelan President Has
Structure That Resists
Earthquakes Absolutely
IS LIKE A GIBRALTAR
Its Armored Walls Potent
Against the Onslaughts
of Foes Within Country
Ciprlano Castro, president of Vene-
Buela, lives in the most extraordinary
dwelling: ever inhabited by the head of
a state. It stands within a park in the
heart of the capital city, Caracas, and
is built entirely of steel. This remark
able government house* of highly tem
pered metal, is covered on the outside
by a kind of soft stone, so that the
stranger thinks it Just an ordinary
dwelling, save that It seems rather
small to serve as the residence of the
first man of the land. Within the steel
walla are covered with lath and plas
ter, so that the visitor sees nothing un
usual. Yet- the walls, floor and ceiling
Of the half-dozen rooms composing
that house are entirely ul steel, and tha
whole is built upon a foundation of
hundreds of tons of Portland cement.
President Castro erected this house
at huge expense, personally directing
its construction. When he moved in
he christened it Mira Fit/res, and by
that name it is known â and laughed at
â by all South Americans.
The steel house was not built with
forethought of fire or flood or wind, but
of earthquake. For it is earthquake
proof. Its few rooms resemble the
compartments in a safe deposit vault,
and in this strong box of a place the
President spends most of his time.
Here, indeed, all the official business
of the chief executive of the republic
is transacted. And here, too, lives the
Senora Castro.
The Castros both come naturally by
their fear of earthquakes. When the
little town of Cucuta, a suburb of Cara
cas, was some years ago shaken from
the face of the earth^as a crumb from
a tablecloth, Senora Castro was the
only member of her family to escape
with her life. And Castro himself, who
happened to be standing on a hill out-
Bide the town, saw his abode crumble
like a house of cards upon the heads of
those within.
Again, in October two years ago, a
midnight earthquake threw Castro
from his bed. Then, in his fright, he
jumped through a window to a paved
court and broke his leg. The next day
he conceived the idea of the steel house,
believing that house built of that metal
upon a very deep, solid foundation of
cement would withstand any earth
quake, no matter how violent
Accordingly, he ordered steel beam*
for the frame and steel plates for the
walls, ceilings and floors, from thÂ«
United States Steel Corporation, and
many months were spent in the con
struction of the only steel house, so
far as known. In the whole world. As
soon as it was finished and furnished
the Castros moved In, and It became
thus the official presidential resi
dence of Venezuela. As Castro owns
both the house and the park surround
ing It, he will probably continue to
live in this abode of steel after the ex
piration of his term of office a few
years hence.
Castro can say with more truth than
did a monarch of France: "I am the
state." For Castro is Venezuela. He
liae seen no part of the world outside
of his republic, but within his country
he is a kind of uncrowned, but ab
solute monarch. He rules, not with
tongue, pen or sword, but with his
thumb. As he moves that potent
thumb to the loft, to the right, so is
the law. One day last year a young
man named I^opez secured entrance by
strategy into Castro's steel home and
fired a pistol point-blank in Castro's
face. By a miracle the bullet went
astray, flattening itself against the
metal wall, and In the rebound strik
ing a member of Castro's ministry
who happened to be in the steel room,
seriously injuring him.
The would-be assassin was made &
prisoner nnd when Castro was asked
what should be done with the man the
President jerked his thumb toward the
door. That meant that Lopez was to
be thrown into the prison, having the
most ghastly reputation in all the
Americas, the Rotunda. Later, when
the prison was inspected, the keepers
said that Lopez had escaped. The
verdict of the people of Caracas, how
ever, was that the prisoner had been
murdered and was buried In the jail
yard, Castro having Jerked his thumb
downward.
A Caracas poet not long ago made
fame for himself by writing a poem
in which he called Castro "Clown of
the Steel House." That poet, one Dr.
Pedro Migare, is at this moment lan
guishing in the Rotunda prison, hav
ing been confined there since last
April, when his poem first appeared â
this without trial and by the simple
mandate of Castro's thumb.
That which Castro fears most, after
all, is not earthquake, not nature, but
humankind. He knows, for example,
that his own soldiers may turn upon
him at any moment, and he lives in
constant ffar of an assassin's bullet.
Hence he remains within the steel
house as much as possible, not only
because it is proof against earthquake,
but because it is also bulletproof.
"He seldom -pays us," say the sol
diers, "so he is glad when we desert.
He simply puts new men in our places.
But some day the steel house will be
come a steel target for a bit of rifle
shooting by the men from whom he
is now hiding. We'll fill the inside of
that house of his with lead, for the
house has windows, and it is always so
hot here that Cast7 - o can not close the
steel shutters without literally suffoca
ting."

ersâDainty, Honiton and Claude to Meet,
Th* feature arranged for this week
ex the Oakland track is the special
race at a mile, in which it is expected
Dainty. Claude. Honiton and W. K.
Condon will meet at catchwelghts. The
New California Jockey Club offers a
purse of $1000, the race being for four- [
year-olds and upward. Much interest
la attached to the prospective meeting
of these well-known performers. With
a dry track there should be a fine con
test. .'â 'â¢â '.
A $1000 handicap for four-year-olds
and upwards, at a mile and a hundred
yards, will be the drawing card Wednes
day, and it should serve to bring to
gether an excellent field.
The California Derby, one of the clas
sics of the West, will be the attraction
en Washington's birthday. There are
ninety-seven eligibles for the event,
which is for three-year-olds at a mile
and a Quarter, with $2500 added. The
best horses of that division racing here
and at Ascot Park will meet. Among
the principal candidates are Dr. Leggo
- and Oxford, two frequent winners. Ox
ford is being prepared by James Mc
laughlin and will be sent up from Los
Angeles. Sir Brillar, Pelham. Plan,
Ara, Hooligan and A. Muskoday are
among others named in the event.
While M. J. Daly is the* principal win
ner, several of the other owners are
rapidly moving to the front. Louis
Ezell is second with $12.&15. and W. B.
Jennings third with 1.710. Dr. Rowell
has passed the $10,000 mark. P. Ryan
and Frank Skinner added to their to
tals during the week.

MODEL 'N II HIIIMim BUWUI
LI\II\ sKASON OF SPORT
With lair Weather Spreckels Lake
Will Present an Animated Appear
ance Every Sunday.
The model yachtsmen who have been
hibernating- for the past two or three
months are a train ready for action.
Whim the weather permitted the en
thusiasts have had their boats at
Spreekels Lake, but either rain or a
lack of wind has marred the pastime.
From this time on the wind should
be good and rainy Sundays less fre
quent. That there is no lack of in
terest in the pastime was manifested
at the meeting of the San Francisco
Model Yacht Club last Wednesday. The
members turned out in numbers and
a lively meeting resulted. Commo
dore Henry London, who was in the
chair, had a hard time keeping the
yachtsmen from all talking at once.
As usual the Dickie cup was the
bone of contention. This is a per
petual challenge cup presented to the
club by George Dickie. It was won
by Mose London's Cricket in the last
regatta and is in his possession. Lon
don's amendment requiring the two
boats winning the intermediate regat
tas to race off did not meet with the
approval of the other boat owners.
This would have made the Dickie cup
race a two-boat affair, with a holder
-nd â  challenger. The amendment
which was carried in place of Lon
don's will undoubtedly prove much
more satisfactory. The holder may
enter the races and still maintain its
right to defend against the regatta
winners.
The December regatta was won by
William Roeckner's Apache. The first
regatta of the year will be held on
Washington's birthday. The Dickie
cup race is scheduled for the first
Sunday after the 224. The cqntest
ants in this race will be the Cricket
(holder). Apache and winner of the
Washington's birthday regatta. Should
either of the boats mentioned win this
event the Dickie cup race will.be be
tween these two boats.
Ex-Commodore Collier's new plan
for holding the Sunday pennant races
met with instant favor. The boats
will start two in a race, loser drop
out. This method will be a great con
venience to the yachtsmen. 'â  asMt' wfll :
require fewer Judges and timers and
will do away with quibbling. If the two
boats meet on even terms they will
start at the same moment and the
one crossing the finishing line first
will be declared winner. If the plan
â¢is successful it will probably be used
in regattas. A suggestion was made
to hold the Dickie cup races under
these conditions, but it was decided to
let the Dickie cup matter stand as it
â,-. -v â  â¢ â  -â -â -.â ;â :
sloop Malx-1 Wins on Park Lake.
There was a good breeze at Spreck
ols Lake yesterday and the model (
yachtsmen completed two events. One
was a cup race for second class sloops
and the other the regular Sunday pen
nant races for sloops of the first class.
.'. J. Doyle's Mabel won the cup of
fered by the directors of the San Fran
cisco Model Yacht Club. ,
The Mabel i.roved the speediest of
the second class models. In the finals
she beat William Roeckner's Annie.
Four boats competed. . The first two
boats to come- together were Hay's
Amelia and Roeckner's Annie. The j
latter won. In the second race Doyle's
Mabel beat Burkharfs Ethel. In the
final race the Mabel beat the Ethel. -*"-'
The Sunday pennant was carried off
by Mose London's Cricket. In the first
race Brown's San Francisco V beat
Jjran nan's Piute two heats out" of ;
three. Mose London's Cricket beat j
Henry London's Imp in straight races.
Pfctersen's , Stella beat Johnson's
Spreckels in straight heats. In the
final race the Cricket beat : the Stella ,

CORRIGAX*% TRACK ENJOYS
AN A I SIM CIOUS OPENING
Conditions Look Dark for Race Course
Operating: Under IJ<-onse of the
Western Jockey Club.
NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 12. â The
prestige of the Western Jockey Club,
the controlling turf organization in the
South and West, was badly shattered
here yesterday. Tho success attend
ing the opening of the Panama track
was marked, despite the adverse
weather conditions. The American
Turf Association was safely launched
as a power In the racing field. The
new track attracted the larger crowd.
Racing at both tracks demonstrated
fcrcibly that two tracks cannot race
here in opposition without great finan
cial loss to the clubs concerned. The
racegoing community of this city is
not large enough to support two race
courses at the same time. If they con
tinue to clash both will lose money.
Scottish Bowlers in Action.
Some interesting matches were
played bj' the Scottish bowlers at the
park on Saturday. The attendance waÂ«
not very large, but the matches were
hotly contested. Judge Shaw and
Robert Park caused quite a surprise
by beating J. McLachlan and G. C.
Patterson quite handily. The scores
follow:
J. M. Reid and J. C. Moffatt beat
E. C. Medean and Andrew Foreman,
21 to 17: J. C. Moffatt and John Mc-
Laren beat Thomas McNaught and A.

POLOIST FALLS
FROM HIS PONY
David Lawson, a Visiting
Player, Is Severely In
jured in a Match Game
RIDING OFF HOBAKT
When the Horsemen Sepa
rate One Loses His Balance
and Is Thrown Heavily
A serious accident occurred during a
polo match on the Burlingame Club
field yesterday afternoon, when David
Lawson, a brother of John Lawson, wits
thrown violently from his horse and
sustained injuries which rendered him
unconscious for more than an hour. He
is still in a serious condition. A phy
sician was .called for and Dr. Siebert,
who was a spectator, responded. It was
some time beore the patient could re
cover respiration. He was seized with
convulsions, and his moanings and tha
blood and froth at his mouth indicated
grave consequences. For a time it was
feared he was dying.
Failing to revive him on the field, a
vehicle was secured and, with Walter
Hobart driving and John Lawson sup
porting the patient, he was conveyed
to the home of the latter in Burlin
game. The physician remained with
him for three hours. He reports that
so far as can now be told the worst is
passed. No bones are broken and he
thinks the patient will recover in a few 3
days, but his condition is still a sub
ject of grave anxiety to his friends.
An unusually fast and good game
was terminated by the accident, which
occurred at the beginning of the second
period. It was during a furious race
after the ball, with the ponies well
bunched. Walter Hobart and David
Lawson were "riding off" each other.
At a critical moment they separated
and LawÃon lost his balance. He
struck the ground with great force on
his neck and shoulders and rolled over
twice. There was great excitement,
and grace fears are entertained that
his neck or spine had been severely in
jured.
The spectators gathered around, the
players dismounted and the game was
abandoned. Mr. Lawson has been in
America but a few weeks, having come
over for the polo season. He was here
five years ago for a similar purpose.
He Is one of the members of the firm
of Balfour, Guthrie & Co., a shipping
house of London.
HANDBALL PLAYERS OOMTÂ»ETE
IN INTERESTING MATCHES
I^arge Attendance of Spectators at the
Games of the Interclub
Tournament.
Four interesting games of handball
were played yesterday in the court of
the St. Ignatius Athletic Club. There
was a big crowd and the representa
tives of the Olympic, Occidental and
St. Ignatius clubs were heartily cheered
for their good work. These games are
the concluding ones of the inter
club hard handball tournament for a
silver cup. The cup was won by the
Olympic Club team, consisting of
George James, Henry Cory, Louis Levy
and George Cunningham. The men
are now playing for individual prizes.
Each man must play eight games.
The tournament will conclude next
Sunday at the Occidental Club.
Louis Levy of the Olympic Club de
feated Maurice Cashman of the St.
Ignatius Club after a hard struggle
by a score of 51 to 24. Cashman's play
ing was remarkably good, but his
hands were too sore for him to make
his best showing. He has the making
of a great player, being strong and
fast. T. Leach was unable to play be
cause of a strained tendon in his
shoulder.
Joe Condon of the Occidental Club
easily defeated Al Collins, St. Ignatius.
Condon took things easily throughout
and Collins was able to roll up 28
points against Condon's 61.
Ed Antron of the St. Ignatius Club
fell a victim to George James of the
Olympic Club by a score of 51 to 38.
Despite his defeat Antron put up a
strong game and surprised his fellow
members by his game showing against
the hard hitting Olympic Club man.
Tommy Lydon of the Occidental
Club beat Charles Wilgus of the St.
Ignatius Club by a score of 51 to 3S.
Both are left-handed players and the
game was therefore interesting. Lydon
won by using a high toss that hit three
sides of the court.
On Thursday night the following
games will be played at the Olympic
Club: Louis Levy, Olympic, versus Ed
Antron, St. Ignatius; George James,
Olympic, versus Joe Condon, Occi
dental; Henry Cory versus Tom Leach,
St. Ignatius, and George Cunningham,
Olympic, vereus Will Canavan, Occi
dental.
The Olympics now have twenty-one
out of twenty-three games to their
credit.
CTBAN AITOMOBFLIST
WINS INTERNATIONAL, RACE
Defeats Joseph Tracy, the American,
In a Fifty-Mile Straggle
Near Havana.
HAVANA, Feb. 12.â The first inter
national automobile race run in Cuba
was decided to-day when the car owned
by a Cuban, E. K. Conill, and driven
by a Cuban, Ernesto Carricaburn, de
feated C. J. S. Miller's car, driven by
Joseph Tracy, by 1 minute 32% sec
onds in a fifty-mile race.
The favorite since Friday, when E.
R. Thomas' ninety horsepower car was
damaged, was O. F. Thomas' eighty
horsepower machine driven by H. W.
Fletcher. The latter, however, suf
fered a series of minor mishaps and
remained a long way behind the others.
The arrangements were admirable.
The grandstands on both sides of the
road were occupied by a crowd of 2500
persons and thousands of others lined
the roadway in that vicinity and at
many other points of the fifty-mile
stretch.
President Palma and members of the
Cabinet and their families and various
Government officials were in the cen
tral boxes.
The crowd was intently interested
and there was considerable betting by
Cubans. The entire road was thor
oughly patrolled by mounted infantry,
rurales and police and bicycle club
members.
Rowling Match To-Night.
The crack Milwaukee bowling team
will play a special challenge match
against the California team on the
Jefferson Square alleys, 925 Golden
Gate avenue, to-night. This will be
the last game rolled by the Milwau
kee aggregation which starts for the
East to-morrow to compete in the na
tional tournament.
FAKTOR PROVES SUCCESSFUL
ON THE RIFLE RANGE.
CARRIES OFF THE DAY'S HONORS
IN THREE DISTINCT COMPETITIONS
The marksmen gathered at Shell
Mound Park yesterday in such large
numbers that the competitions ap
peared like a national shooting festi
val. The sharp north wind appeared to
spur the riflemen to put forth their best
efforts. There was just enough of chil
liness in the atmosphere to keep the
eyes clear and the nerves steady. As
a consquence a number of excellent
scores were made, both in medal com
petitions and in bullseye contests.
D. B. Faktor, always a champion,
carried oft the honors of the day by
winning the first medal in the expert
class of the Germania Schuetzen Club
with 224 rings. He also won the cham
pion medal in the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein with 222 rings. In
addition he captured the honors in the
latter club by scoring a center for his
first shot of the day.
Otto A. Bremer, in the competition
shoot of the San Francisco Schuetzen
Verein, made the fine scores of 73, 72,
71, 70 and 71 out of a possible 75. It
will be a long time before this excellent
score is beaten in a day's shooting. In
the same event H. Bornholdt scored
72, 72 and 70 among his highest rec
ords, while L. Bendel and Fred Brandt
made 71 each. These marksmen are
starting the season in champion form
and intend to place high records to
their names before the year closes.
In the re-entry match of the Golden
Gate Club M. F. Blasse was the top
man with 224 and 223 rings to his
credit. He also scored the highest
number of red flags, making eight dur
ing the contest.
The best bullseye of the day in the
Norddeutscher Club was made by F. P.
Schuster with 358 points. He was
closely followed by A. Westphal with
422. The day's scores:

DIVIDE HONORS
Richard Anton and McVey
Run One, Two for the
Union Park Class Stake
Greyhounds from the kennels of
James Sweeney carried off the highest
honors yesterday at Union Coursing
Park. Richard Anton and McVey met
in the deciding courM of the class
stake. At the first attempt Richard
Anton went unsiglitfld, and Judge
Reilly sent the dogs back to the slips.
At the second attempt Richard Anton
broke fast from the slips and led to the
hare by five lengths. He won by an 8
to 4 score.
The wisdom of the bettors in making
The Duke the overnight favorite for
the reserve event was fully justified by
the showing he made. He met in turn
Mellinwood, Yellow Tail, Concord Tra
lee, Amandan and finally Conroy. He
beat the latter cleverly by a score of 10
to 4.
The favorites held their own well,
comparatively few long shots scoring.

THIEVES MAKE A RICH
HAUL IX THE MISSION
lilppman Brothers' Dtfy Goods Store
Is Entered and a Large Quantity
of Silk Is Stolen.
A daring burglary of a dry goods
store was reported to the police last
night. Shortly after midnight a
watchman discovered that thieves had
entered the dry goods store of Lipp
man Brothers, 2696 Mission street,
and made away with 200 yards of the
best silk in the place. They had evi
dently been frightened away, as other
valuable' articles in the place were
untouched. The burglars gained en

store. _
The Perils of Peace.
While we are raising our voices in
protestation against the barbarities of
war it is a trifle disconcerting to learn
that right here at home in a single year
3787 persons were killed and 51.343 in
jured as a result of railroad accidents.
War has its horrors, but they are an in
dispensable adjunct of the game. Not
so the startling loss of life incidental
to the operation of railroads in the
United States during recent years. Ac
cidents there will be; fatalities will
never be unknown as long as there are
railroads, but there is no justification
for such a showing as that made during
the twelve months ending June 30 last.
Liaoyang has a bloody record; Port
Arthur has taken its place as one of the
greatest slaughter spots the world ever
knew. Yet the frightful death list there
loses much of its terror when one con
templates the showing made by the
railroads in this country. â Detroit Free

Darkness Sets In at Ingle
side Coursing Park Be
fore Card Is Completed
Darkness set in before the two stakes
at Ingleside Coursing Park could be
finished yesterday and the finals of the
Reserve and Class events were post
poned until next Sunday. Consider
able delay was caused during the day
by the hares running from their course,
after leaving the chute. With more
driving the hares will become familiar
with the escapes and will provide
fairer trials.
Quita and the Southern dog Agile
Spurt will meet in the tinal of the
Class stake. This should provide an
unusually close test, as both dogs ap
pear evenly matched from their sbow
ing yesterday.
. Doc Burns showed his old time form
in the Reserve stake and would prob
ably have led Concord Boy in the final
had it been run.
Pasha Pleasant was running in ex
cellent form but was unlucky in hav
ing hard running and was withdrawn
in the third round, giving a bye to
Quita, Quita did some wonderfully
clever work in her trials. Once she was
placed on the game it seemed impossi
ble for her opponent to score.
Another dog which is regaining his
form is Little Plunger. He went into
the semi-final round but was beaten
through a severe trial in the preced

INDEPENDENTS
BEAT VAMPIRES
Hornet Team Defeats the
Pickwicks 3 Goals to 1
at Mora Park, Oakland
CONTEST IS SLOW ONE
Topnotchers' Lead Cannot
Be Overcome in Kace for
Championship of League
In the matches played yesterday for
the championship of the California As
sociation Football League for the sea
son of 1904-1905 the Independents beat
the Vampires two goals to nothing on
the cricket ground at Alameda. The
Oakland Hornets defeated the Pick
wicks three goals to one on the ground
at Idora Park. Arthur Robinson was
referee of the Vamjrtre-Independent
match and A. D. Couper of the Hornet-
Pickwick contest.
The Independents scored one goal in
each period* of play. McFarlane, the
new goalkeeper of the Vampire team,
did excellent work in saving, or the In
dependent score would have been con
siderably greater than it was. The
teams lined up in the following order:

every match, only one more game be
ing left on the regular schedule.

somewhat slow, each team having but
ten men and the attention of the spec
tators being entirely taken up with the
ascent of the airshiD California Mes
senger, which started successfully from
the football field. The teams lined up
as follows:
Pickwick â W. T. Bowcock, goalkeep
er; Kervin and McKee, fullbacks;
Moon and Bowden, halfbacks; Robert
son, Warren, A. E. Bowcock, Rutledge
and Inganni, forwards.

EATS POISONED BISCUIT
AND RUSHES TO HOSPITAL
H. E. Davis Devours Food Intended
for Hats, but Doctors Manage to
Save His Life.
After feasting on a biscuit that was
poisoned with arsenic to tempt a
bunch of invading rats, H. E. Davis,
750 Castro street, broke all records in
his run to the Emergency Hospital
late last ni^ht. Davis was not aware
that his midnight lunch was a sort of
short cut out of the world till inform
ed by Miss PauMne Glasser, a roomer
at his house, that she had poisoned
the biscuit. He arrived at the hospital
just in time for the surgeons to pump
out the poison and save his life.
Davis returned home tired and hun
gry and at once went to the "big feed"
that happened to be lying loose about
the premises. After putting away all
of the good things in view he saw a
biscuit, and under his belt it went in
a few gulps. Just after he had fin
ished Miss Glasser rushed into the
kitchen and informed Davis that the
biscuit was drugged with arsenic to
tempt the rats.
Davis nearly collapsed when he
heard the news, but recovered his
senses in time to make a dash for the
first car. He arrived at the Emer
gency Hospital, quickly told his trou
bles to the surgeon, and was soon re
lieved of the deadly stuff.

Lost His Foolish Wager.
The managers of two of the best
hotels recently opened on upper Broad
way made a novel wager some weeks
ago. One of them claimed that there
were no dishonest people in his estab
lishment, and he made a bet of $50 that
he could prove the truth of his claim.
The other manager promptly took him
up. To test the honesty of the patrons
in the hotel concerned a bath sponge
of the finest quality, a silver-mounted
hairbrush and comb and a toothbrush
were placed in one of the toilets on the
third floor. On the very first day of the
test, and barely two hours after the
articles had been placed in the toilet,
the comb and brush were missed. Then
nothing happened until five days after
this, when the toothbrush disappeared.
This was followed three weeks later by
the sponge.

hotel, "I paid the bet, and it's the last

BAKER PLAYS
CLEVER TENNIS
Although Heavily Handi
capped He Wins Matches
Without L,Â»ss of a Set
LONG BROTHERS BEATEX
Baker ami Howell Prove Too
Steady for Them in the
Handicap Singles Tourney
Some Interesting tournament matches
were played yesterday on the tennis
courts. On the park courts the handi
cap singles tournament commenced
several weeks ago was completed down
to the semi-flnals. No tournament was
scheduled at the California Club, the
players confining themselves to contin
uous tournament and practice games.
The four successful players at the
park were George Baker (owe 15 3-Â«;.
L. Howell (3-6), Harold Gabriel
(scratch) and A. Brabant (owe 3-6).
Baker is the most heavily handicapped
player in the tournament, but has won ,
his matches without losing a set. He
has given big odds, his wonderfully
steady game carrying him through. It
is probable he will have much harder
matches from now on. First he meets
Howell, and If he wins he will be pitted
against either Gabriel or Brabant. Both
of the Longs were beaten in the same
round and by exactly the same scores.
Baker disposed of Herbert Long. This
was not much of a surprise, but the de
feat of Melville Long at the hands of
Howeil was unexpected. Long pulled
his two previous matches out cleverly
' after losing the first set 6-0 In each.
The score against both Longs was 6--.
6-4. In the Long- Baker match the win
ner was too steady for his opponent.
Long received 'owe" odds of 3-6, but
they availed him little.
After beating Jewell and Palmer,
Melville Long looked to have an excel-,
lent chance to win a prize. Howell re
ceived odds of 3-6 and owe 3-6. and
made good use of them. He played a
clever game.
Gabriel beat Morton In his first match
and Lemon in his second. Morton was
called upon to give odds of "owe 3-6."
which put him out of the race. Gabriel
won as he pleased, the score being 6-1,
6-1. In the . Lemon-Gabriel match the
latter lost the first set. but won the
next two. Gabriel kept up his winning
streak and took Marius Hotchkiss into
camp in straight sets. The tournament
committee underrated Gabriel, who is a
clever youngster.
Brabant had an easy time winning
his matches. He won from A. Mc-
Farland and C. Teller in straight seta. .
Teller made a good showing in the
second set.
In the continuous tournament at the
California Club one match was played
in the first class and two each in the
second and third classes. George
Janes, the No. 1 man, beat Carl Gard
ner in straight sets. The loser had a
lead of 5-2 In the first set and 5-1 in
the second set, but was unable to win.
Janes pulled out both sets, the score
of each being 7-5. Gardner looked to
be a sure winner in both sets, but he
seems unable to take Janes' measure..
Gardner was within a point of winning
the first set. but was too nervous.
In the second class Albert Kenyon,
who graduated from "the third class
recently, worked his way to the top of.
his class. Kenyon was in third place.
He first beat George Cutter, the No.
3 man, In straight sets. Paul Jones.
who headed the class, was the next
victim. Kenyon had a much harder
time beating Jones. The latter won
the second set, but lost the first and'
third. Kenyon has been improving
steadily. He has declared his inten
tion of going right after tie first class '
men.
"W. G. Knowlton won two matches
in the third class. He first beat H.
1 Punnett. the man below him, and then
took revenge on Dr. Lovegrove. Last
Sunday the doctor beat the New
Brunswick champion after a hard fight.
Knowlton was at it all week early and
late and Improved enough during the
week to beat Lovegrove. The match,
like the one a week ago, was extreme
ly close. Knowlton Is in third place.
The scores follow: Â«

Captain Jewell (3-6). 0-6, 6-4, 6-3; Lemon

TWO MEN HURT
IN A RUNAWAY
Cab Driver and Coachman
Miraculously Escape In
stant Death in Smash-Up
A double runaway, which started in
front of the Hotel St. Francis shortly
after 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon, re
sulted in the injury of a "cabby" and
a carriage driver and terrorized the
neighborhood for blocks around. The
injured men are J. Dillon, driver for
Kelly's stables, and Walter Handy,
coachman for Dr. Morris Herzstein.
Both men were badly bruised and mira
cously escaped alive.
The accident happened directly in
front of the main entrance to the hotel.
Dillon was seated in his cab when a
Powell street car came along and, ac
cording to eye witnesses and the driver,
bumped into the horse. The animal be
came frightened and started to run up
Powell street.
The horse had proceeded but a short
distance when he crashed into Dr.
Herzstein's hack, driven by Handy.
Fortunately the vehicle contained no
other passengers, for in the general
mixup that followed it was completely
demolished.
Both Dillon and Handy were thrown
violently to the ground and it was
feared for a time that Handy was
fatally hurt. The runaways continued
un their mad career along the street.
Handy's team turned around and
dashed into Geary street, running along
to Market and down past the Palace
Hotel before it was halted. Handy was
treated at the Waldeck Sanatorium for
a wrenched leg and several bruises.
Dillon's horse ran into a curbing at
the corner of Post and Powell streets
and that brought the animal to a sud
d.-n halt. Bits of broken glass and
fragments of the shattered vehicles
were strewn along Powell street for a
block. The horses all escaped injury,
thoush they came dangerously near
runnins into several passing cars.
Thr streets were fairly well thronged
at the tirm- and excitement prevailed
while the maddened horses were tear
ing along thr thoroughfares. Women
and children who were passing through
Union Square at the time ran crying
and screaming hither and thither, but
luckily they retained presence of mind
.li to keep off the streets till the
danger vÂ»as passed.

BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM FIGHT A DUEL
UNTO DEATH WITH PISTOLS.
Husband Is Instantly Killed
HONEYMOON OF OAKLAND COUPLE
IS BRIEF AND ENDS TRAGICALLY
PRINCIPALS AND SCENE OF A BLOODY DOMESTIC TRAGEDT AT OAKLAND YESTERDAY MORNING. WHEN A YOUNG
HUSBAND AND WIFE CLOSED THEIR HONEYMOON WITH A PISTOL DUEL. IT ENDED IN THE DEATH OF THE
MAN WHO TRIED TO KILL HIS SPOUSE. â¢ [
A pistol duel to death between th
bride and bridegroom ended the bri
honeymoon of Edward R. and Eleano
Koehn of Oakland yesterday.
The husband was Instantly killed b
the woman who only seven weeks ag
had promised to love, honor and obe
him, but she says he fired a shot fir
and had threatened to kill her.
The young wife is held for murder b
the Oakland police. The tragic end
the honeymoon occurred where the ro
mance of the oouple began, at Koehn
home, 789 Fifty-eighth street, Oaklan
The husband shot first, declares Mr
Koehn. Hardly had the strains of th
Lohengrin wedding march died in the
ears when the couple began to rind tha
they were unsuited to each other, and
petty domestic squabbles led to fierce
quarrels, that culminated in the fatal
Koehn wag packing his effects to
leave the place when his wife entered.
Furiously he ordered her to go. She re
fused. Forgetting in his rage that he
once loved the woman, he drew a pistol
and shot to kill. The woman quickly
got a revolver from under a mattress.
How it chanced to be there is not ex
plained. Four times she fired at Koehn
and he sank to the floor with a bullet
in his neckâ dead.
"I shot until he dropped," Mrs. Koehn
said afterward.
RUSHES FRO3I VICTIM.
As soon as the husband fell Mrs.
Koehn rushed from the place to the
home of her parents, a few doors away,
carrying the smoking weapon in , her
hand. There she wrapped the pistol in
a paper bag and boarded an electric
car. The attention of Captain of Police
A. Wilson was called to the woman,
and he asked her what had happened.
"I have shot my husband," said she.
"Here is the pistol. I was on the way
to the City Hall to surrender myself."
The woman was taken to the City
Jail. That ended the last chapter of
the romance of the Koehns.
The first chapters are prettier. In
the spring of last year Edward R.
Koehn, a prosperous young clerk, first
saw Eleanor Paganetto, a beautiful
young Italian girl. It was on a bright
spring morning when he was hurry
ing to catch a train to his work in this
city. The girl's dark eyes made such
an impression on him that he could
hardly think of dry figures and musty
books.
On the next morning he saw her
again in her own garden a few doors
from his home. She seemed even more
beautiful, if such a thing could be pos
sible. Then and there Koehn began to
think that his thirty-two years had
been spent in vain and that his life was
incomplete. He was in love.
He did not confide his secret even to
his mother. Alone he tried to devise
excuses for speaking to her. The op
portunity came in a manner that
astounded him.
One evening when he returned to his
home his mother met him at the door
of his home, saying, "I have some one
here I want you to meet." To his de
light Koehn was ushered into the pres
ence of his divinity of the dark Italian
eyes.
AN EAGER LOVER.
He made the most of his chances. A
few weeks after the meeting the pair
were betrothed and Just a week before
Christmas Koehn and Miss Paganetto
knelt at the altar together and were
made husband and wife . Friends and
relatives thought it an ideal match. So
ended the lirst chapter of the romance.
Only a few weeks later the blissful
tranquillity of the honeymoon was dis
turbed. The couple lived with the
elder Mrs. Koehn, who, the wife de
clares, caused the first little matri
monial jars.
Little differences were magnified by
both husband and wife and fierce quar
rels ensued. Sometimes it was a petty
disagreement between the wife and
mother-in-law, sometimes a dispute
about the butcher's bill or other sordid
little things.
Then the husband began to evince
signs of vague jealousies concerning
his wife. In fits of rage he frequently
threatened to kill her. Finally Mrs.
Koehn left the place, fearing that he
would keep his word. She went to a
neighbor's house and wept over her
, shattered romance. So ended the sec
! ond chapter.
According to Mrs. Koehn the cul
i mination of their unhappiness was
I reached Friday night. Her husband
i came home earlier than usual. They
1 walked into the kitchen together and
during the conversation Koehn buried
i his face in his hands and declared he
had a mind to kill his wife and himself.
Mrs. Koehn, alarmed by the threat,
I left the house, going to a neighbor's,
I Mrs. E. Kruger's, where she spent the
I night.
STORM CLOUD APPEARS.
In the evening Kruger and Paga
netto, the father, had a talk with
Koehn. Mrs. Koehn was unable to
learn what her husband had said. She
remained away until this morning,
when Mrs. Koehn went to the house
at 9 o'clock and found Koehn there
packing up his belongings. The wife's
story of what occurred follows:
"When I opened the kitchen door I
saw mv husband, who became very
angry and wanted to know how I got
into the house. . I told _him that I was
his wife and had as much right in the
house as he did. He was packing his
papers and Jewelry, preparing to leave,
when he suddenly turned on me and
said:
" 'If you don't get out of here I'll fix
you," brandishing a pistol.
"There were a few more words as we

MARVELOUS CURE BY CUTiCURA
"At four months old my baby's face

fired at me. I grabbed a pistol from
under the mattress and fired back un
til he dropped. Then I rushed out of
the house to mv mother."
Mrs. Koelin insisted that she shot in
self-defense to save her life after her
husband had sent a bullet at her.
WIFE LOCKED OUT.
Koehn's mother left the house Fri
day before her son's quarrel with his
wife, and went to San Francisco.
Koehn was not at the house Saturday
and his wife declares she had locked
her out of the place. She tried to re
turn, but was unable to until this
morning, when she found a key that
fitted the back door.
Mrs. Louisa Paganetto. the girl's
mother, said Koehn had been ugly and
violent for some time. As late as Fri
day, the mother declared, he had
threatened to cut his wife into ribbons

and had told her to pack up her things ,
and get out. The young woman cor
roborated her mother and adds:
"My mother-in-law did not like my ,
*ay of running things, and my hus- '
band would take her side when we j
had disputes about the household af- .
fairs. As late as Friday morning Mrs. j
, Koehn objected about my spending too i
much money for meat, fruit and vege- j
, tables. Then I was sick and that ir-
I ritated my husband. We had words
I over that."
HUSBAND ACCUSED.
Peter Paganetto, the girl's brother,
; insisted that her husband had been un- !
duly violent in his treatment of his
wife. Paganetto said:
"Koehn was talking about my sister
I and finding fault with her because she
! was ill. He was not kind, and his ;
mothei did not treat my sister kindly, i
either. He had no cause for complaint. I
My sister had kept company with no >
one before she met Koehn.
"Saturday morning my sister wanted â¢
to go back to the house, but Ed had
locked her out. She got in this morn
ing, and when she mcc her husband he
ordered her to pack up her clothes
and get out. After the shuoting I heard
her scream. 'I've shot hrni! I've shot
him!' as she xan into the alleyway. I
rushed out to meet her. She said her
husband had tried to kill her with his
, pistol and she had fired back at him."
Neighbors summoned the police. Pa
j trolman I. D. Tobin entered the Koehn
! dwelling and found the slain husband's
; body on the floor, his pistol at his side,
i with one cartridge exploded. Mrs.
Koehn's revolver, a Colt, had four
1 empty and two undischarged shells in
it, the condition of the weapon verify
ing her statement to Detectives Kyte
and Qulgley at the City Prison concern-
Ing the shooting.
Mrs. Koehn, the bride, was born in
Italy, but has lived in this country
I since her childhood. Her father is a
1 shipwright and has been employed for
many years at the Union Iron Works.
San Francisco. Koehn was a native of
Germany. He had been with the Pacific
Hardware Company for fourteen years.
The Coroner will hold an inquest as
soon as the police have the evidence
in shape. A. L. Frick, as attorney for
Mrs. Koehn, has taken charge of her
case. After an interview last night
with his client he declared the shooting |
to have been done in self-defense.
BURGLARS VISIT SALOONS
AND HELP THEMSELVES
Two Men Are Arrested on Suspicion
of Entering One at Tenth
and Market Streets.
Two saloons were visited by burg
lars early yesterday morning. About
6 o'clock Policeman H. Crowley found
the glass door of Louis Wamser's
saloon at Market and Tenth streets
broken. Harry Morton and John Al
len were standing close to the door.
When they saw Crowley they walked
away quickly in the direction of Ninth
street. Crowley followed them and
was joined by Sergeant Sylvester and"
Policeman McMahon.
They overtook Morton and Allen at
Ninth street and took them back to
the saloon. Their answers to ques
tions were unsatisfactory and when T.
de Baquiere, the bartender, made his
appearance a few minutes later ami
said that the cash register had been
forced open and $-' 90 stolen it was
decided to lock up Morton and Allen.
When Morton was searched $2 iO
was found in his pockets.
Sam Calori. saloonkeeper. *1Â« San
some street, reported to the police that
his saloon had been entered by burg
lars between 10 o'clock Saturday night
and 7 o'clock yesterday morning. En
trance had been effected by forcing
off the padlock on the front door with
a "Jimmy." The burglars stole twen
ty boxes of cigars valued at 175. seven
bottles of whisky valued at $7 and
had taken $2 in change from the cash
register.
The saloon of Myers & Holsteiner.
corner of Geary and Polk streets
entered during Saturday night by th^
thief or thieves breaking the glass hi
the side door and forcing back the
bolts. After gaining admission the
cash drawer was broken open and $45
extracted from the till. The theft was
discovered at 6 o'clock yesterday
morning, when Louis Schumacher, the
clerk, arrived to open up the place for
business.
Misplaced confidence is not always
the result of being absent-minded.
