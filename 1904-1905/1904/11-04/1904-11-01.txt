In a quiet and composed manner the
possessor of this strange assortment
said: "I am Mrs. Grace - Squires. I
live at 1178 McAllister street. This is
my own property. I was in that place
on Turk street koklng for rooms when
I was moved by a sudden fit of curios
ity to look into that bureau."
The prisoner was taken to the City
Prison and Detectives Regan and
O'Connell were detailed on the case. It
developed that the address given by
Mrs. Squires was a correct one. She
had been living there with a Mrs. M.
Rogers for several weeks and for about
a month and a half previously at a
house on Ellis street. She has a nine
year-old daughter, Grace, who has been
with her.
Mrs. Squires says she is the wife of
a mining man of Downieville. She says
she left that town ; about two months
ago because of her health and brought
her little d?" jhter : with her. Every
article of jewelry she carried she as
serted was her own and the money, she
maintained, was a remittance from her
husband.
To a certain extent her assertions are
verified by Mrs. Rogers, . who says she
has known Mrs. Squires for two months
and that during that time she has seen
her wear many articles of jewelry that
correspond with the collection held by
the police.
There are many, points ; in the case
that are puzzling:. Mrs. Squires entered
Mrs. Campbell's room u with a key that
did not fit her : McAllister '6treet resi
dence. The little woman's quiet ac
ceptance of arrest is also puzzling. It
is regarded as either the fearlessness
of innocence or the sang froid of an old
crook. None of the jewels are like any
lost by Mrs. Wallace of 1645 ' Larkin
street on October 18. - Whether, or not
they belong to Mrs. Squires she will be
held on the burglary charge.

Waving . his cap to assure those who
were following, his every move, Kna
benshue moved toward the rear of the
airship, v The Arrow pointed Its prow
upward, and, answering the pull of .the
propeller, soared lightly above the
fence and rapidly gained an altitude of
about 1000 feet.
CLEARS THE BARRICADE.
Knabenshue at that time was not
high enough to % clear the aeronautic
fence, and as he rapidly approached It
the crowd held its breath, fearing that
the craft would be dashed against ine
barricade and the aeronaut badly % in
jured or perhaps killed.
: The Arrow arose slightly and easily,
Its prow directed toward ' the west.
When at a height of about twenty-five
feet Knabenshue turned the rudder
and the aerial; craft, answering to its
helrii, pointed south and continued its
flight without Interruption.
Alter a*"- has^y - c"i&ailnÂ»tian .Baldwin

being momentarily ; augmented, cheered
the announcement 'and patiently await
ed while the repairs were being made.
At the time fixed by. Baldwin the air
ship was again brought from the aero
drome and hastily groomed " for - the
flight. At* a signal from Knabenshue
it was cast loose and the motor started.

ST. LOUIS, Oct: 31â A. Roy Knaben
shue started' with the airship California
Arrow, from the aeronautic course at
the Exposition grounds at 3:37 o'clock
this afternoon and returned after a re
markable flight at 4:05 o'clock. On the
return trip the airship sailed slowly over
the exact spot from which it had arisen
twenty : eight minutes previously and
glided about 100 feet * farther west,
where it settled gracefully to the
ground. ,
, The descent /of the Arrow was the
signal â for, a demonstration, the equal
of which has. not been seen since the
wheels of the World's Fair started last
April,: in, response to the pressure on a
key by President Roosevelt Dozens of
eager, hands were outstretched to 'grasp
the frame of the' airship, and the flying
machine,' with its '.' daring navigator,
was ' carried around the Â¦ concourse upon
the shoulders of the shouting " men.
Hata- were thrown into the" air, and
when Knabenshue called ' for three
cheers for his home town:. they were
given with" ; a will arid : another round
followed ' for Knabenshue and Baldwin.'

"As a result of to-day's flight I'havÂ«
unquestionably Qualified for a trial.
Knabenshue went up with Instructions
not to go far from the aeronautic con
course and then bring the ship to the
ground after a trial of a half hour.
He came within two minutes of obey
ing my Instructions to the letter.**
Captain ; Baldwin was 'extremely op
timistic regarding the. future of hla
airship. He said:
"Now I will not be content to leave
before I have had several trials for
that 4100,000 prize. The conditions are
rather severe, but I think that the
Arrow can make the required distance
within thÂ« time limit!
WILL TRY FOR THE PRIZE.
'\ When w Â«rUhln Â«. few hendred yards
of the concourse Knabenshue moved
forward;, the Arrow responded imme
diately to the downward shift and
sailed toward the. ground without a
dimlnishment of speed.
1 Knabenshue entered ' the concourse
from the east from a height of about
two hundred feet, and, slowing the
speed of his* motor, directed the airship
directly over the wooden trestles that
had supported the Arrow before ihe
flight started. His momentum was too
great to admit of stopping exactly in
the place from .which he had made the
ascent, but the airship settled to the
ground within one hundred feet-
Without: . deviation .the California
Arrow continued on in the teeth of the
Kreeze./ gaining speed and" rushing
tow ard , the concourse In an imposing
wanner?;,*--.-- .Â¦ - ' ,:Â¦Â¦' â¢-<-Â¦ /Â¦â¢',,- ." y
; Sailing first to. the northwest and
then to the southeast, occasionally
making complete turns, Knabenshue
continued In a generally easterly direc
tion until over the Cascades, the cen
ter of the. World's Fair grounds, and
about a mile and a. half in a direct line
from the -point of starting?.
* "At; about that time the barely per
ceptible breeze that had been blowing
from the northwest increased to about
eight miles an hour and veered to the
north. , In order to return, to the start
ing point it was necessary for Knaben
shue to breast this breeze.
SPEEDS ; AGAINST THE BREEZE.
He attempted several times to turn
to the left and then, suddenly, swung
the rudder "sharply in the other direc
tlonand the Arrow came into the wind,
staggered a moment and then, gaining
power,* came toward the concourse at
a speed that caused the spectators t<
cheer and to throw their, hats into the
air. The demonstration was observed
by Knabenshue, who leaned far out
and waved an empty ballast bag.
Knabenshue again change^ the direc
tion of the craft - and passed over the
crowd In the concourse. After proceed
ing one-half to three-quarters of a mile
westward Knabenshue turned > the air
ship about and again; passed -over; the
concourse, at the same time increasing
his altitude until . he was about 2500
feet above the earth. -

Financial Independence.
Financial independence comes from
saving your money. There may be other
causes which contribute to wealth. Un
doubtedly there are. But a man's savings
constitute the rock on which tho foun
dation of a fortune is built. Trace the
source of? the -wealth of any rich man in
this city, and you will find that he began
by savins part of his earnings. .You can
do the same. If you have not made a
habit of savin* you can easily begin by
putting nside part of your earnings each
week or each month % Time and Interest

use of both gold - and â¢* silver as . money and
condemns ; the policy of the Democratic ad

Mr. Phelan also expressed "his pleas
ure at the genuineness and warmth of
the reception that had been accorded
him, which, he â¢ said, was especially
pleasing to him in view of the fact
that he has Just returned to the city
after a long absence. Governor Cham
berlain followed Mr. Phela.n and for
him the audience had reserved cheers
and applause which were evidently ap
preciated by the distinguished execu
tive. After expressing his pleasure
Governor Chamberlain said in part:
The- campaign now in progress is in many
respects the most remarkable in the history of
Presidential contests In this country. It is
remarkable first, because of the astounding
claims made by our opponents and the reasons
urged for their perpetuation in power, and,
second, because of the methods being resorted
to to accomplish that end. And here- let uÂ«
examine come of the reasons urged < for the
election of a . Republican . President and see
whether or not they are sound.
First, it is insisted that the election of
a Democratic President will endanger the gold
standard, for the establishment of .which our
opponents Â¦ claim to be alone responsible. L
say. and I. appeal to the* record; of the -past
few* years . to sustain me, â¢. that our Republican
friends have not- always been friendly to tho
single gold standard, but on the contrary have
charged In the past ' that a Democratic Pres
ident waa responsible for its establishment.
Not only that, but. the preu which now claims
bo much credit for. what the .Republican, party
has done to irrevocably establish the single
'gold standard only a short while ago . was
lauding to - the skies that -same Democratic
President â¢ and those who followed him in vot
ing either for . Palmer and Buckner â¢ or for
the Republican candidates direct, for. assist
ing in doing . what confessedly . they could not
do without such assistance.
Why,' my "fellow-citizens, the Republican
party appears now for the first time in itÂ«
history as the champion of . the . single gold
standard. Its conversion has been gradual, for
prior to 1 890 it was the unvarying custom of
Republican platforms to denounce Grover Cleve
land and . other Â¦ wicked Democrats for. trying
to demonetize silver and to fasten the single
gold standard upon the country. \ In Â¦ 1891 the
late President McKiniey, in a speech at Toledo,
Ohio." excoriated President- Cleveland for being
hostile to bimetallism and charged that during
all Â¦ of his years at the head of : the Govern
ment he was "dishonoring one of our precious
metals, one of our own great products, dis
honoring sliver and enhancing the price of
gold." In 1S0O he had said In Congress: "I
am for - the largest use of . silver in the cur
rency of the conntry. I would > not dishonor
It. - 1 would give it Â¦ equal credit , and ; honor
with cold.* I would make, no discrimination;
I would utilize both metals as money and-dis
credit neither. ' I .want the double standard."
Other Republican * speakers,-? Cannon.-"-- Dlngley.
Allison, . Dolllver i and . others Â« might be quoted
along the' same lines. The Republican platform
of 1888. which waÂ» reported , by Mr. , McKiniey,
contained the ; following : plank :
PLliLVSED AT RECEPTION.
mines and forests .and virgin soil, hardly ex
plored as yet, but which yield amazingly, and.
tlrus wealth Is created and distributed. But
thÂ£ quesUon with us is not bo much the crea
tion of wealth, of which there 1b an abundance,
but the distribution of wealth, and the Demo
cratic party claims that the trusts were ere-,
ate.d and protected (and that is. what protection
really means) -by an unequaiand unjust tariff.
and, hax-ing grown to the position of-such
enormcrus power, dictate tho distribution of
that wealth which springs Irpm the bounty of
nature and the creation, invention and enter
prise of our own people. Â¦- They do as trey see
fit and naturally, if unrestrained, as thei? self
ish interest* suggest. Hence, when Carnegie
retired from the Steei Trust he took with him
$250,000,000. accumulated in a few years. That
vast eum was contributed by every industry.
every railroad, ! every building j erected in
tho country, by every- trade using iron
or iron products. It cost more to ride
bn the railroad, and so" on all through tho
multiform affairs of daily life that tax fol
lowed the consumer. And this one steel indus
try, known a* the Steel Trust, has capitalized
its property for a sum greater than the na
tional debt.- The Government is t.he only
power to regulate such condition*, but the
Government is in the hands of the Republican
party and the Republican party is the father,
of tariffs and trusts, and we are. asked by the
Republican party to commit the -amelioration
of these gross abuses to its care. In . other
words, we ask the Republican party to com
mit haia-kiri. The time has come for the peo
ple to make their protest and enforce their
iemedy by the election cf the party of the
'opposition, which has entered the llsta pledged
to. right these wrongs.
Governor Chamberlain demonstrated
the' faqt, in concluding his speech, that
he is democratic in the broadest sense
of the term. He invited all the people to
pay a visit to his State during the_falr
next year if thev can, "and," he said,
"when you come do as you like in my
offices. Come there and if ' you are
weary and vour feet rest uneasily un
der the table put them on it and enjoy
yourselves to the fullest extent."
His last remark won for him the full
regard of the audience and it cheered
and applauded, and ' then, in response
to Cha'Irman Lane's call, gave | thr,ee
more cheers* for Governor Chamber
lain and three cheers and a tiger for
Parker and Davis. .
"Now, this is a statement that does not
reat upon my authority, but upon the authority
of records in the State ; Department, presided
over by Mr. Hay, the poet laureate of the
administration. .
| To show the shallowness of the claim of our,
opponents , that ' they alone ' are to be trustt-I
in dealini: with the money question; I . quote'
from a sptech recently made by Bourke Cock
ran in whichjie said: -"But, my friends, you

after* the gold standard had been â¢ sustained
by an overwhelming: vote of the American
people, after the gold Democrats . had gone
out of their door with their lives in : their
hands, not knowing whether ever .again they
could find admission to the ranks wherein all
the days of their political activity had besn
spent, tho Republican machine attempted

Speeches were made by Philip J.
Hasklns, Jesse Stelnhart Jr.,' Marc
Anthony, A. L. Hart Jr. arid R. B.
Treat. ., : :
Kahn was loud in hfs praises of the
navy. He believed in building up a
strong navy to. protect American
interests. He did not believe in war
fare and battle unless it was forced
upon the nation. If it was forced he
believed the country should be in a
position to meet it. Disputes should,
however,' be settled by courts of ar
bitration. So' far as Parker was
concerned, no one would attempt to
question his honesty and his patriot
ism, but his ideas upon what should be
the policy of this country w^re wrong.
Kahn was in sympathy with his au
dience, ' and his remarks ~, -were fre
quently Interrupted by applause.
Walter S.Brann was chairman.
I Democrats dem't feel enough interest to vote.
They know the country is In good hands. Sen

the biggest Republican majority ever known
in that State. A leading Democratic laboring
man said to me last week- that the laboring
men are t-ettins better wages than they ever
got 'be/ore, and that they are satisfied with
the present administration. Roosevelt is an
honest, loyal, straightforward American .citi

Hayes' confined his argument chief
ly to national Issues, likening the
toiler of to-day who votes for the sup
port of the' Republican, platform unto
a man who takes a gold piece from
orfe Â¦ pocket and places It in another
rather than throwing it broadcast.
The trade of the, country, he said,
should be kept in -the country. We
can produce all we i need an-d; there
is no occasion for opening the gates
to' foreign competition. *Â¦
this same line Hayes put himself
strongly on record as regards the Chi
nese and Japanese. He stated posi
tively â¢ that aside from employing
Asiatic labor he was unalterably op
posed to it and if elected to Congress
wculd raise his voice for the exclusion
not only of ; the Chinaman, but his
neighbor, the Japanese. â¢
.To secure proper legislation, he con
tended, it Is necessary to have a' solid
delegation in Congress. The next Con
gress will, according to his calcula
tions, unquestionably be Republican,
and a Democrat looking for a favor;
s>uch as the building of a warship- on
this coast, which would mean the ex
penditure of millions of dollars, , would
never .be recognized.

Senator Perkins further said in his interview
with me, after he had read a stenographic re
port of Bell's Colusa speech, delivered on Oc
tober 25, 1904, that be was astounded beyond
reason to see the assertion mad* by Mr. Bell
Continuing, the speaker said
Subsequently the .bill passed the
House and came u]j to the-" Senate, in
just ; exactly the foFm that if Had been
introduced by the Naval Appropriation
Committee. When it reached the Sen
ate it was referred ttJ the Naval Af
fairs Committee, of which Senator Per
kins is a leading- member, and in that
committee Senator j .Perkins proposed
an amendment that one of the colliers
be constructed oh the Atlantic * sea
board in the~Government yards andthe
other at Mure Island. At this Juncture
the Senators from Oregon and Wash
ington came to Senator Perkins and
told him they could not stand for the
designation of the Mare Island navy
yard, as it would seem to slur the other
yards of the Pacific" Coast, and that if
he would chansre the language so that
the measure provided for the c instruc
tion of jl collier oh the Pacific Coast
they would assist .him in the Senate.
Senator Perkins acceded to the request
and the Senate passed the bill ,aa
amended. Subsequently the House con
curred in the amendment.
Senator Perkins further said that he
was astonished. and surprised to hear
that-Bell claimed credit for a measure
with which he (Bell) had nothing to do
and the credit for which belonged to
others of the California delegation.
The great surprise came when Dozler
proved by the words of Senator Per
kins that Bell did not secure the ap
propriationor allowance of J22.000 for
the improvement of the Sacramento
River.
"If you doubt my assertion," said
Dozier, "wire to Senator Perkins at
my expense. Here is *100 for any one
who gets a reply impeaching the ac

trouble where the party was so an-

particularly at night, that it entailed
loss of sleep, and as a consequence
lack of energy ensued- the following
day. The kidney secretions contained
so much acid that they scaldedâ in
fact, sometimes were -particularly
painful. A course of the treatment. of

to the Diet at its meeting on November
25. The war expenses are. estimated' at

the war expenses by increasing the tax J
ation by $45,000,000, by retrenching from
the advance expenses and the suspen
sion of public works by the amount of
$35,000,000 and to raise the balance, $35,

MUKDEN, Qct- 31. â The Japanese
army is rapidly being reinforced and
it is expected that the new troops .wil)
shortly number "from 40.000 to 60,
000. This greatly complicates the
problem confronting the Russian com
mander. â¢ The whole energies of the
Russians must be .devoted [to holding
.their positions, uniess they" can bring
up large reinforcements â¢ speedily.
Even in that case the situation prom
ises to become increasingly difficult.
The Japanese fortifications already
are far too. strong, -supported as they
are by siege guns and rapid fire pieces,
to be carried by a frontal assault. Pos
sibly these fortifications mrght yield
to a turning- movement, which would
force the Japanese to retire," but this
would- require a great superiority in
numbers, for the Russians must hold
their center with a force at least equal
to â¢ that of the Japanese in â¢ .order to
prevent the latter cutting through arid
severing the communications- of the
former.
Two battalions returning early on
the morning of October Â£9 from the
banks of the Shakhe River ( came un
der the fire from Japanese twelve-Inch
guns, several shells falling In the Rus
sian ranks, doing considerable dam
age. One man was rendered deaf and
dumb, but otherwise uninjured, and
another was thrown into a ditch and
buried alive. A number were killed.

Sinchinpu on October 30 the Japanese
assaulted the position held by . the

were repulsed.

The Japanese on October 14 sent

After several days of quietness big
guns commenced booming to the south
.east last night, continuing until early
this morning. . Fighting "has take'n
place between feconnoltering parties,
the * Japanese ' having crossed the
Shakhe River toward the southeast.
A big ba.ttle is expected this week,
which, unless successful for the Rus
sians, probably will be the last under
the present arrangement. A com
plete reorganization of the army is
now under way.
" .The Japanese have occupied a rocky
promontory south of Slndiapu and also
the hills southeast of Koutlatze. The
positions along the line are strongly
fortified with redoubts, wire entangle
ments, ditches and pitfalls and also
mines in some places. The fortifica
tions are arranged in double tiers. The
positions, especially on the plain, are
extremely well masked. On Saturday,
through telescopes, the Russians . ob
served a movement of the Japanese
eastward, and, Judging by the dust, lt
must have been a heavy force. |

. MUKDEN. Oct. 31. â From an early
hour this morning there has been a
heavy bombardment of Poutlloff (Lone

masses of Japanese were moving east

ber 30. " : -: r - ':'J

IXJXE TREE HlIiL ATTACKED.
Owing to the constant shelling of
Port Arthur, the Russian ships there
maintain low pressure steam, so as to
enable them frequently to change their
positions. Since October. 6 the Ret
vizan, the Poltava and the Peresviet
have often been hit, and one steamship
used In sweeping for mines was sunk.
One gun of the Electric Hill battery
and one on Marble Hill have been dis
mounted by Japanese shells.
The stories of Russian prisoners vary
concerning the garrison affairs, but
they agTee, however, in saying that
they have been often disappointed.
General Stoessel has been endeavoring
to cheer them by promising the early
advent of the Russian second - Pacific
squadron and relief from General Ku
ropatkin. The constant failure of these
hopes to materialize depressed the sol
diers. Stoessel is quoted as saying
that while a thousand men were left
he would not surrender.
Except for the knowledege that the
bombardment was continued, all In
formation covering the period between
October 27 and October 29 is lacking,
but presumably it was much of" the
came character as that just described,
the Japanese operations gradually as-
Euming the proportions of the general
cttack of yesterday. The fighting Is
reported to have been most severe from
Rihlung Mountain dorm along the
whole east Bide of the town.
Upon the retirement of their troops
the Russians opened fire from Ljaoti
Mountain," and that night. they made -a
sortie. But the Japanese in the mean
while had brought, up machine guns,
with which the sortie was. repulsed.
One company of Japanese engaged in
this fight aroused general compliment
es*y comment for its remarkable cool
ncKs, executing the various maneuvers
for the purpose of securing shelter With
automatic exactness, as if on parade.
Meanxvhi'.e the fire of' all the availa
ble artillery Â«nui directed against* the
Russian trenches, the Russians event
uaily retiring:, ivhere-upon the Japanese
in thirty minutes constructed sufficient
trenches to shield themselves. The
Russians exploded mines, but, the Jap
anese claim, without result.
In the meanwhile another body of
Japanese assaulted the trenches' "on
the Elope of Rihlung Mountain..". The
Japanese trenches extended" to. cer
tain portions of the slope -and stpp.ped
some distance above the extreme Jap
anese outpost, where -the ascent of
Rihlung Mountain ' becatoe almost
perpendicular The Russian' trenches-'
seamed the slope. To â¢ advance
against them over an unbroken slope,
v.hlch wai mined, even without Rus
sisÂ»tÂ» resistance vouM have been a
difficult task; but the slope "had been
torn up, great holes having been
blown in it at various' places by trie
bombardment, and â¢ the Japanese
availed themselves of . -those indenta
tions, which offered combined foothold
and protection against the bullets. â¢
Oa October 24. having made every
possible preparation, the" Japanese
opened fire with their artillery alomg
the whole line, incidentally continuing
their daily practice of- dropping -shells
into the harbor. The -Russians . re
plied, the sounds, as of distant thun*
der. telling the inhabitants of Poi-t
Dalny that the long-expected assault
on the fortress was imminent. . .""
The bombardment continued Â¦ fu
rioasly until the afternoon Â«f October
26, when the Russian gun's on Etz
Mountain, Antz Mountain and Rihlung
Mountain became briefly silent; ' At 4
o'clock that- afternoon a regiment of
Japanese swept out -from behind 'a
recently captured hill .adjacent to Rih
lungr Mountain and advanced on. -the
Russian trenches lying.*etween Rih
lung Mountain and -the railroad,, oc

CHEFU, Oct 31.â A sjteamship
which has Just arrived " here from
Xewchwang reports having heard
heavy firing at Port Arthur last night
end to-day until she was out of ear
shot, indicating, a continuance of the
battle which began on October 21' and
developed yesterday into the third' at
tempt of the Japanese to secure 'a
commanding: position."
: . The Russian forces are disposed so
as to meet the disposition of the Jap
anese armies. The present plan â¢ of
Russian operations apparently has not
been Influenced by the promotion to the
position of of .commander In chief of
General Kuropatkin, who, remains with
his army in the field.
The present cold weather- has influ
enced many Chinese to return to. the
fields, with the object of rescuing their
remaining crops. 'The exodus of Chi
nese villagers from the region west of
the railway continues, but- the. pressure
on Mukden-has been .; relieved , by the
return home of ' families who had be
come unduly alarmed. v - - ]
In many districts the hd*Uses are dis-"
appearing, owing to the fact that wood
of which they were'eomposed has been,
or is being," removed for. use as fuel. In
the graveyards the trees â¢ have . been
felled and used for the purposes of fuel,
the making. of; fortifications or the
building": of bridges. Â¦
Japanese shells are daily breaking on
Pagoda Hill, which is the most conspic
uous in the Russian position,; and in
front of which the Chinese villagers re
main in their homes, indicating that by
some prearrangement with the Japan
esp'. their. homes will noi be. shelled by
the latter. <Â¦
SHEIilJNG PAGODA IIILIi.
Last night there was the heaviest
bombardment of the week from the
Russian <: batteries, "arid . the
are seemingly apprehensive of a crucial
surprise. This bombardment was ac
companied by a continuous rifle fire,
while .the Infantry advanced by means
of quick intrenching at Intervals of , a
few hundred feet under cover of dark
ness.' _
The outcome of this activity is a
tense vigilance along the, entire extend
ed front. This tension, taken in con
nection with the reported reinforce
ment of the Japanese by one and a
half divisions from Port Arthur, is
likely to precipitate a great battle
within a few days. The , combatants,
however, apparently, are not disinclined
to winter in their present positions, as
the forces have adopted a system of
winter housing in the field.
From their immense bivouacs both
armies calmly behold one another and
are able to distinguish - one another's
entrenching gangs as they drop their
tools when relieved. These observa
tions are made from points of vantage
Immediately outside the range of the
artillery, which is intermittent in its
practice ' against the principal emi
nences.
MUKDEN,- Oct. 31.â The manifesta
tions of the Japanese in their center,
which converges at.a point where the
plain meets the hills, have attained the
greatest importance. These manifesta
tions - are being fully . met by the Rus
sians, so that the situation at this point
of the ; prospective battlefield" to now
one of the greatest interest and appre
hension. "
At the present moment the trenches
on both sides are crowded with troops,
and at many places the' Japanese and
Russians . are within hailing distance.
At the Isolated hill of Manalon, on the
plain, where the Russians ten days ago
captured fourteen guns and bayoneted
800 Japanese, the rival, forces are only
600 paces apart.
The situation is perhaps the most re
markable in military annals. Two arm
ies, each wlth^ the other as an objec
tive, are approaching j while construct
ing siege works, the making of which
both sides are accelerating, each morn
ing revealing the work done over night
to the observation stations on every
hilltop. "
The Japanese after their disaster at
Manalon Hill retaliated on' October 27
by turning the Russians from a pyra
midal hill opposite Ferichiapu, seven
miles 'to the east. The Russian position
was commanded from three directions,
and Its defenders withstood a loss of 60
per cent from artillery fire on the aft
ernoon of the 27th before they were
forced out by the Japanese Infantry at
night; The Japanese abandoned the
positlop immediately after it was taken.
This event does not equal in importance
the capture of Manalon HllL The Japa
nese, who are posted on a similar hill
to the south, appear now to have most
determined designs to retrieve the posi
tion they abandoned.
RUSSIANS FEAR A SURPIRSE.
"The enemy, with 11-inch guns, keeps
up a severe fire, bombarding the forti
fications, on the north and northeast
front on the east of the railroad and
in the interior 'of the fortress simul
taneously. They are approaching our
forts by means of trenches, their farth
est advance being In the vicinity of a
forl; situated south of the" village "of
Utsiafau, Â¦ necessitating the greatest
caution by our gun and rifle' fire and
gallant sorties by our sharpshooters.
Our troops, I am happy to report to
your Majesty, continue the fight hero
ically despite -the fatigue and priva
tions. .We ask for your blessing and
for that of the Empress."
" In the later telegram, dated October
17, General Stoessel. said:
"Yesterday, at about 3 !n the after
noon, the Japanese commenced a furi
ous bombardment of the forts and for
tifications. -'A particularly severe fire
was directed against the north front
near the railroad, the Japanese having
advanced along the railroad to the : vil
lage, of Palitchouan with field-artillery.
Our artillery and sharpshooters re
pulsed the attack. The fighting ended
at 7 o'clock, but the usual bombard
ment continued all night long. The
Japanese sustained considerable loss."
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 31â A tele
gram from General Stoessel, dated Oc r
tober 17, constitutes the latest official
news from Port Arthur. The general
then announced that the Russians had
repulsed a Japanese attack on the forts
north and northeast of Port Arthur on
October 16 with heavy loss to the as
sailants. General Stoessel also asked
for the blessing of the ' Emperor and
Empress.
In a telegram dated October 14 Gen
eral Stoessel said:

Novel Situation
South warcl of

â¢ On the night cf October "30 the Jap
anese attacked " the Russian- entrench
ments east of SinchinDU, but were re
pulsed, though the bombardment con
tinued throughout the night. The Jap
anese advance has also begun against
the Russian positions at Tunganon, a
mile and a half north of Sentsiaputze.,
wherÂ« they encountered a heavy" Rus
sian fire. T*hus it appears that the Jap
anese are 'becoming aggressive along
the \rhole front, from Bentsiaputze, on
the extre.me east, to Sinchinpu, which
is west of the Shakhe River, where
that 'stream bends., south ward after
crossirig the railroad. This probably
constitutes "the extreme. Russian west;
making the battle front about the samo
as when General Kuropatkin' began -his
southern movement. " ? ;.": :','"
G'eneral Kuropatkin. is confronted *y
Â¦an exceedingly difficult "problem." He
is â¢' pitted" against a Japanese . force
stronger, even despite its recent losses,
than that which opposed the. southern
advance. If Kuropatkin ' succeeds in
checking : or even breaking the Japan-:
ese formation i.t will open . large possi
bilfties for the brief remainder of the
year's campaign. Qn the .other, hand,
a Russian reverse now would \ render
the- position exceedingly critical.
The dispatches indicate ' .the resump-<
tion of fighting on both extremities, of
the Russian front. â¢ - .
. IV seems assured that the Japanesa
will be able to meet General Kuropat
kin on almost If. not quite an equal
numerical footjng. The mere fact
that "they â¢ are again threaten
ing. Â¦ double- flanking indicates Field
Marshal. Oyania's â¢ confidence in
the- sufficiency " of the" Xorce at.

more serious' than th.e -first, as the first

.General -Kuropatkin reports that the
Japanese have received reinforcements
from the south of Fengwangcheng.
Their concentration .seems to have been
accomplished and they are ready to
resume ' th-s offensive, both east and
west of the railroad. There is no ofil
â¢cial estimate of the "strength Of the
Japanese reinforcements, but corre
spondents place it at from 40,000 to
50,000. lt is believed that the Japanese
force has been" very largely augmented
both from Port Arthur, where ah en-,
eineering siege has been" begun,- and
Japan! whence It is understood every
available man is being drafted. "V
ST. * PETERSBURG, Nov. V (3:05
d: m.)â Everything indicates that both
the Japanese and Russian armies south
of Mukden are ready for the resump
tion of hostilities! Indeed, fighting has
already begiin. . '. '
along the whole Russian front . Rus
sian sharpshooters were worrying* the"
Japanese considerably at night. -

Scientific men, who were told from
time to time of this wonderful . stone,
ridiculed the idea that it possessed any
curative 'properties. They claimed that
it was bj superstitious idea which had
been handed down from generation to
generation by the Indians.
A short time ago several pieces of the
stone, which I Is found in considerable
quantities 'in. the .mountains, -were ob
tained by a mineralogist of an inquir
ing turn of mind and taken to the City
of Mexico, where they were analyzed.
They were; found ; to possess radio
active properties of a very high degree.
Some of these specimens emitted a
brilliant light when placed In contact
with a metal substance, and when thus
placed under water the light was In
tense in its brilliancy.
It is now admitted by the scientists
who have Investigated the matter that
the cures alleged to have been per
formed by this peculiar stone were
probably genuine and that Its curative
properties lie in the rare element which
it contains. .. ~ V
As an evidence of .the' truth -of this
belief the Indians pointed out that no
one who had worn the stone had died
from the diseases which they, claimed
It cured. s'J Many Americans "w^rG . con
vinced of the wonderful powers of the
stone by the cures which they saw it
perform, ; and there is now hardly art
American in the mining camps of that
region . who" does not carry a piece of
the stone around with In his
pocket. 1 '' i) : 'l-rUP***
AUSTIN. Texas. Get. 3Lâ The mys

many years, and, In fact, for probably
untold centuries, "has > been regarded
with awe and. interest .by,'. the' inhabi
tants of a remote mountain region in
the Sierra Madres, in the, western
part 'of the State of Chihuahua, Mex
ico, has been solved. When 'the first
Americans entered that . region , many
years ago they 'found that the Indians
there wore a small ; piece Â»rf a peculiar
stone, which .was attached , to a thong
around their" necks." The Indiana _ as

no power, they asserted, in fevers or
sicknesses of that ' character.

BUFFALO BILL
TO HAVE RIVAL
and It looked as It there would be a general
fight. The house gave vent -to its disapproval
by tremendous hooting and wildly ' Â¦ cheered
Britt as he went to the center of the ring.
; . Just before the fight there was great
excitement and bustle all along the
Rialto.- It -was quiet enough up to
about 7 o'clock, but then the masses be
gan . to, gather â¢;'. and betting, became
brisk.' The Britt money. was coming so
fast that the price began Tto rise gradu
ally! 'The^bettors could hardly, get their
coInVon"; when 1 the s final crash - came.
The'Gans admirers had theirs to wager
in large .chunks, and naturally it took
some .time for.,; the j Britt followers to
gather their smaller sums together.
Â¦ .The betting on the rounds was not so
brisk.; A few thousand ".dollars" was
"{by Gans admirers "* ; that he
would beat Britt Inside : of fifteen
rounds. This seemed to^sult the Native
Son's backers, and they" fairly. swarmed
around to get . their coin up. They came
so- fast. that lt^waa nearly-impossible. to
handle! it ' all." These":; bettors .were "still
"making -frantic efforts 'to olace their
coin Â¦ when- the fight began.;
7 There was some ; play ; on^ the rnutuei
boards ..that; Gans would win? In Â» from
ten to vflf teen rounds. â¢ The betting . was
about : even .. money^ that * Britt .would go
ten? Some ; of the - Gansj admirers -were
Vvilllrig ' to^lay 8 against - 10 , that he
jwould, 'beat Britt .Inside - of .'.seven
rounds, but little betting resulted /on
that "score: ; â¢,
â¢ Most of the money, however, was
wagered at odds of 10 to 7 and 10 to 6y s .
These were the prices that prevailed
throughout the. afternoon and In the
early evening:. Strange to- say, there
y/as plenty of Gans coin in sight all the
time, and the Gans people feared that
the price would decrease, and for that
reason they tried to place their coin as
early as possible. The bettinc was
mostly done in small sums, the admirer
of the Californian being there with the
change most of the time. Â¦
When Britt and Gans entered the ring
the odds we're. 10 -to 8 in favor of the
colored champion. They rose to that
price from'. 10 to 6 a few hours before.
As predicted by all the wise ones, tho
Britt money began to come with a rush
at thÂ« last moment, and this was re
sponsible for the steady rise in the
price. j.
Round 3 â They mixed.it fiercely ; at close
quarters,- - both doing: very : clever: - blocking.
Uans rot in a' good right to the body,' but Britt
retaliated with straight left hard, to the stom
ach. They : mixed \ It, again, .Britt . putting left

over the heart., Britt at close quarters greatly
distressed Oans with a fearful right over the
body. Gans â¢ clung , desperately to <'â¢ Britt ' *o

Round 2â Britt missed left and ; right '' for
the body and they Â¦ went' to a clinch. Britt
suddenly lunged his left to the head and then
brought it to the body.- Gans continued ' to'
lorce Britt about the ring and they came to a
clinch without result. Britt "tJssed a left hook
for the body and then sent'a straight leit to
Gans' noÂ«e. Cans retaliating with . left to the
body. " Britt drove uans back : with a left
swine to the body. ,. Britt bored In, scoring
with left and right to , tho wind. Â¦" In the mix
both 'exchanged rights and lefts ' to -. the . face.
Britt missed a vlclious left for the body. They
came together, Britt missing. left and right for
the body. A rally in the center of the ring
tollowed, Britt landing right and left, on the
face * as ' the toell rang, s but not before he - had
received a : straight Â¦ left to : the - head. â¢ Bi itt

honors were about even, however. Â¦â¢*"Â¦>.â¢>
Round 1 â Britt went. at once Into his favor
ite crouch and they sparred for some time.
Britt shot his left twice " in quick succession
to Uans' body, but the blows | were not forci
ble. After some more sparring Britt hooked
bis left to the body again and followed it
with right to the head. Both then missed
rights and lefts for. the head. Gans followed
Brttt about the ring and cleverly' blocked two
lefts and a right for the .face. Then like a
flash" Brttt Jshot his . left to the : body and
isiisi-x-d .-. & right for the head. Gans was ap
parently sizing up Britt's reach. Gans missed
a straight right tor the head. Britt was short
with leit (or the body and missed a left for
the head as the bell , rang. . The work in tills
round was light, Britt having - a light advan
tage. Gans permitted Britt to do most of the
work. Britt's blows were of a light nature
and did no harm. ; ' â¢ Â¦ ' . Â¦

approval of all the different groups,
agreeing to refer the question of the
prosecution of Deputies to the Court
of Cassation. ' '
â¢ Britt waÂ« warned by me
after, the' fourth round that he
.was fouling Gans and he paid
no -.' attention ;to^ my warning.
When he ','. deliberately fouled
Gans in the" fifth round I could
riot do otherwise than award
the fight to the colored man.
Britt pulled Cans down and hit
him. He wrestled Gans to the
floor and struck him while he
was down. It was a great fight
and Britt had the better of it.
Britt fought so fast that he had
Gans tired. I did not call the
bets off because. I have nothing
to do with the bets. Britt com
mitted a foul and lost. There
is no difference betwen a white
man and a colored man when
they are H In a ring. If a man
acts wrongfully his color '- will
not prejudice me in Ids favor.
Gans was weak after the second
round. There was no steam* in
his blows. He blocked nicely,
but Britt gave him no rest.
Britt's :â¢ . improvement was
marked. He is a good fighter,
but has a tendency to lose his
head.-â Eddie Graney, in an in

I admit losing the fight; the
decision was fair. ,1 could not
help it.* 'Gnns kept slipping to
the floor "without being, struck.
He also kept hanging on to me
and I tried to fight him off. I
demonstrated to-night some
thing that 1 held for three years
â that I/could lick Gun*. I did
it to-night and I can : do it
again. The referee. says I lost,
therefore I can't say aught
against him. I am willing to
fight <*an.< again for any kind of
a side bet. - To-morrow night
would wilt ; me. . I, am 1 sorry I
Iom my head'and struck the ref
eree. I could I not help it j be
catiso I felt he had treated ; me
unjustly. Gans never marked
me or ; hurt me. I . was too fast
for him 'and surprised him. He
did not have an ice wagon be
fore him to-night. I went in to
win and in my opinion I would
have knocked Gans out had the
fight continued. I never felt
better in my life and I set a
pace for. Gans that I could have
kept : up - indefinitely. ' Get Gans
for me again and I will prove
I am his master.â Britt's state
ment after the fight.
Â¦ I was too weak to do myself
Justice. After I went to my cor
ner in the second round I knew
it. I mould like to fight , Britt
again, but I would not do it at
13S pounds ringside. It is the #
first time I did it in my. life. I
will fight Britt at 133 pounds,
weigh . in at 3 o'clock,' or 135
pouqds ringside.. Then I could
rough it with him. Britt is very
strong, but not as fast I as peo
ple think'. . He \ lias a good,
punch... â¢" H<j hit me. in the stom-v
, aolw pfcj ,-dlQ not â¢ drppj.to avoid
punishment ; the punches in the
Kt-omach made me go down. He ,
fouled ! me twice and the rr/erce
hod to give nie ; the ../decision*.-'
Britt* is a good .boy and Is a de-!
ternuned fighter. There was no
steam in my punches. His blows
did not make me groggy, but
my own weakness told" on "me.
The hard work I did to reduce
my weight'told on me. When I
went into the/ring I felt I
could beat any man. After the
second round I knew I was in,
as the pace and blows told on
me. Britt would, have won had
it continued. â Interview with

BRITT FOULED

BRITT ASSERTS
HE IS MASTER
OF BLACK MAN
Willie Means and Jack Daley, a pal?
of lightweights, opened the evening's
entertainment with, a four-round draw.
The decision was not accepted by the
gallery gods with any too much grace,
for Daley was coming- fast at the
finish while Means looked all In. Daley
had many chances" to bring home the
coin in the fourth, but he was shy at
the critical moment.
Daley was -hustled around the rtn*
in a lively manner in the first two
periods and Means was apparently
winrJngr easily. But- Daley began to
but-in strong- in the third. Means
showed that he did not like the game
and began to tire when Daley rushed
him to the ropes. Daley was wild with
his swings Â¦ and could not put in the
finishing punch. The gallery howled
when the referee signaled a draw.
A likely looking lad in the person of
Eddie Chambers was unloaded in the
second preliminary. He made Jack
Burke look like the rankest kind of a
busher in three rounds. Burke was
so badly beaten up that his seconds*
threw up the sponge- All Chambers
lacked was the decisive wallop.
Among others in the vast audience
were Samuel Shortrldge. Dr. O'Donnell.
Garnet Ferguson and Billy Magrane,
the well-known turfmen; Joe Stevens,

H. B. Smith of the Telegram, a very
competent writer on sporting topics
from the same city, occupied another
prominent, seat.- "
Close up at the ring side Will McRae.
sporting editor of the Portland Ore
gonian, observed the scrap through. a
powerful pair of binoculars and will
have something to say later on.
Among the bunch from. San Jose
were Jim Woods, Billy George and
Jack Gilpin.
{ Salinas had a big collection of sport
ing people, and Jim Tynan, Joe Con

way for the others.
From away up in Aniador County,
Randall Ellis and J. Cook came down
to see that Jackson found representa

Herbert Baker, {he well-known hotel

To make sure .that all the choice
seats were not grabbed up on him,
Jim Hayes, proprietor of Harbin

MANY DISAPPROVE OF
REFEREE'S DECISION
CHAMBERS SHOWS HE'
IS A LIKELY BOXER
The second round wound up in a
fierce slugging match, in which the two
men fought like tigers. Britt was able
to send his left to the body, contrary
to the expectations of Gans' admirers.
Just \ at the end of the. round Britt
missed a desperate right and left
swing. â¢
Early in the third round Britt sent a
straight right to the body, which un
doubtedly hurt Gans. Gans came back
with a right to the head that only
shook up Britt and made him fight the
faster. The going was so fast at the
end of the round the house was in an
uproar. -Britt rushed Gans across the
ring in the fourth round and a moment
later landed a hard right upper-cut to
the jaw. This was the beginning of
the end for Gans, as he seemed to have
had all the fighting he wanted at that
time. From his actions the spectators
thought he was ready to quit, and the
decision of Referee "Graney In his favor,
in the next round created a tremendous
sensation.
to allow him to weigh In and retire to
his dressing-room. Harry Corbett, who
held the forfeits, was called for and the
weight was set. Gans stripped and
mounted the scales. He did not budge
the bar and a great cheer followed.
Gans then retired to his dressing-room
to sip a few spoonfuls of beef tea, and
ten minutes later Britt, followed by
"Spider" Kelly. Frank Rafael, Charlie
Reno, Curtis Richardson and "Tlv"
Kreling. entered the ring. Jimmy was
given a great cheer. He turned anx
iously to brother Willie and asked:
"Did you see Gans weigh In?" and Wil
lie replied, "Yes; he did it beautifully."
Jimmy then stripped and mounted the
scale, and, like his colored opponent .
did not budge the bar. "Spider" Kelly
bandaged Britt's right arm with tape,
so that the weak member might with
stand the blocking, that Gans would do
la the battle. . " '
Britt demanded that Gans be brought
into the ring, as under the articles of
agreement Gans could only stay in his
dressing-room ten minutes. Gans came
forth when called and as he mounted
the steps leading to the ring he stum
bled and Herford, who was immedi
ately behind' him, whispered 1 euper
stitiously, "Disappointment, Joe." Lit
tle time was wasted and after a few
preliminary moves the gong ' sounded
the beginning of the battle!
Britt was sent into" the" ring -.by 'his
trainers in magnificent- physical con
dition. He had apparently undergone
a severe mental strain a few hours be
fore the fight, as his face was pale and
bad a drawn look, not caused by the
weight he was required to make. He
set a terrific pace throughout, and it
did not seem to. tell on him at any
stage. Britt's muscles did not show on
the surface of his body, while the con
trary was the case with ; Gans. . The
muscles stood out in deep bands around
his body, like the ribs on a washboard.
When Gans- went back to his corner in
the second round he knew he was not
up. to the severe fight that was expect
ed of him. and told "Herford he was not
able to rough it with Britt. It was the
old case of that intangible quality,
vitality,; being Impaired. ; This is a
quality which j the eye cannot measure
in any animal trained for competition.
It requires the actual test to develop
Its absence.
BRITT LEADS. FROM THE START.
There- was no hard i blow struck in
the first round, throughout which Britt
was the aggressor, doing all the lead
ing. Occasionally Gans measured him
with his left, as though gauging the
distance and getting ready for future
action.
Gans 4 began to grow- impatient,. and
he turned to the newspaper men and
said:' "We were- to weigh 'in at- - 9
o'clock." He appealed to the referee
The challenge of Jimmy Gardner of
Lowell, Mass.. did not meet with ap
proval, as Gardner shirked ; a match
w 1th Gans . two months ago. . "Young
Corbett" also challenged the winner,
and lesser lights, did likewise; ;
"One of the best boys in the worldâ
the pride of Denver. Young Corbett"
When the deafening roar had died
away Nelson was introduced as "one
of the hardest nuts to crack. Battling
Nelson." Gans slipped through the
ropes during the introductions and
leaned against the top rope, waiting to
be welched. He wore a frown on his
forehead and a long dressing. robe on
his body. .
Jack Johnson was Introduced as the
"colored heavy-weight champion of the
world, who challenges ufay man in the
v\ orld for the championship."
Referee Graney took his stand in the
center of the ring attired In a heavy
overcoat that covered his immaculate
shirt, front and tuxedo. The referee
tested the scales and fixed the weight
at 133 pounds.
The receipts were 531, T90. Of this
Fum thp flghters received 70 per cent,
which amounted to $22,246. As Gans
by winning received 50 per cent of the
fighters' sfcare, he/and Britt each car
ried away $11,123.' The Shasta Club's
share was JS5U. Â¦
The betting was 10 to 6^ when the
men Entered the arena. Gans remained
favorite throughout the betting.
At Â»:16 p. m. two husky janitors car
ried the scales into the ring and the
spectators roared approval. The pho
tographers tranced their cameras on
the scales and waited for the men to
appear. "Battling" Nelson and Young
Corbet*; who are to flght this month,
steppe. I Into the ring and Announcer
Jordan introduced Corbett in the fol
lowing manner: â '
It was plain that Gans had planned
to win fairly if he could and on a foul
if he saw it was going against him.
All his actichs in the ring pointed to
this. Gans looked In great condition
ti> the eye, but it was evident he was
not the came Gans physically who
fought Walcott or else he knew .the
white boy had the "Indian sign" on
him. There was not the sting to his
Mows and at no stage of the game
did he land a blow that worried Britt.
The latter was unmarked, but he was
mentally depressed over the outcome
of the contest.
Britt, in explanation- of the alleged
foul, claimed that from the manner In
which Gans hung on to him there were
times when he did "not know Gans'
knee touched the ground.
GANS'. PLAN TO WIN.
To Justify his dcision Graney said
that Britt deliberately fouled Gans, al
though he was warned not to do so.
Graney declared that Britt wrestled
and threw Gans to his knees and while
the colored man was. in this position
deliberately struck him. â¢
The crowd surged nip to the ring and
there were repeated cries to "declare
ail bets.' off." The referee paid no heed
to this." V- '^Â¦" : .;'~v ,,-.'..*':-:
Instead of appealing to the referee,
Britt struck Cans several â¢ blows with
left and right to the head. The house
was in an -uproar. . Referee Graney mo
tioned to Gans, signifying that the col
ored man had won. When It dawned
on Britt that he had lost on- a foul he
was frantic with rage/ He rushed at
the referee and struck him a *hard blow
en the jaw. There was a clinch and
fighter and referee rolled over on the
floor, while patrolmen leaped Into the
fiftfe Xrom every \ corner and dragged
itaem apart. After they were separated
Graney walked jiway, but his anger
overcame.him .again and he tore off his
Tuxedo and started in the. direction of
Britt. Friends caught him and led .him
to one Bide. -
Had Britt kept his head at : this
point and appealed to the referee, the
latter would have had to warn Gans
of his Infraction of the spirit of the
rules and would have made him, stand
up and fight- Had this been \done
Jimmy Britt would be able this morn
ing to add the title of lightweight
champion to that of feather-weight
champion which he holds.'
WHERE BRITT LOST.
Jimmy Brttt defeated Champion Joe
Gans decisively In the Mechanics* Pa-
Tilion last night, but under the decision
of Referee Qraney the flÂ«nt went to
Gans on a fouL Leading up to this
traa a Aeries of dramatiq Incidents
which kept a vast crowd on the tiptoe,
of excitement tor more than an hour.
dans was outboxed. outfought and
outgamed by the wonderful Califor
nian, and secured the hollow honors of
a victory by a. decision which Is not In
accordance with the rules of the ring.
The two boxers and the referee each
contributed his mite to bring about
this result Joe Gans deliberately
went to his knees In the fourth round,
when, he saw the tide of battle going
against him. Britt, who was flgnting
like a cage full of tigers, struck him
while he was down.
Referee Graney then made the mis
take which had the effect of. starting
ap Incipient riot a few minutes after
ward. Instead tif warning Gans that
he must .not go down without being
hit, the referee paiO all his attention
to Brttt. He warned the Californian
that he must; not hit Gans when he
was down. The end came. In a sensa
tional manner in the.: fifth .round.
Britt's fighting blood was at fever heat
and he threw discretion to the winds
and sailed into "Gans with irresistible
force. The latter could make no stand
against the onslaught and in just
thirty-eight seconds he went .to his
knees. * .. - Â¦ â¢*

have been made to entertain the visit
ors. From there they will go dirct to
Hermosillo. At .the latter place the
Mexicans will be accorded another
great reception. . . . '
Yesterday was the busiest day
Ramon Corral, Vice President of Mex
ico; has spent since his arrival in Cali
fornia, 1 and it -was one 'of the most
notable of his Western tour. In the
forenoon v the Mexican visitors and
friends to the number of about forty
were the guests of Mr. and Mrs. I* J.
Canallzo of 1218 Broadway, Alameda,
and were driven about the city, after
which' the party proceeded on a special
train to San Jose, where they were en
tertained' at the ? College _ of Notre
Dame, -the Vice President's two daugh
ters being students of the institution.
?' Returning ; here In the evening,
Serior Corral and other male members"
of his party were the guests of Thomas
H. Williams at a dinner in a well
known French restaurant and from
there they proceeded direct to the Pal
ace Hotel; where a' public reception
"was- accorded the distinguished;Mex
icans in the parlors on f the first floor.
During the reception the band from
the battleship Ohio played the national
airs Â» of ; both republics and discoursed
popular music. The citizens' commit
tee took advantage' of the occasion to
present the "Vice President with a
beautifully, engraved gold" plate as a
memento of the recent public banquet
in his honor. The presentation speech
was made by Colonel George Pippy,
chairman of the citizens' committee.
Senor Corral* responded in Spanish,
which wag interpreted -by General
Torres. .Inscribed on one side of the
plate are the words: "Presented to
Ramon Corral, Vice President of Mex
ico, by the Citizens of San Francisco,
October 22, 1904/' and on the other
side are the names of those who have
had charge of the entertainment of the
visitors from the -southern republic,
aÂ« follows: v
" Emmett E. Oliver and Miss Olga
Pauson, members of representative
San Francisco families â one Gentile,
the other Hebrew â recently plighted
their troth before a San Rafael Justice
of the Peace, and the manner of their
marriage makes It a romance 'that Is
causing considerable Interest among
their many friends.: . -
The groom Is the son of D. R. Oliver,
president of the Western OU Refining
and Manufacturing Company, and the
bride the daughter of Frank Pauson.
president of the Central Light and
Power Company. An announcement of
the marriage has Just been made.
The relatives of the bride say they
were aware of the betrothal arid offered
no objections. Papa Oliver says he was
not apprised of his son's matrimonial
venture until yesterday. A week after
the 'ceremony Mrs. Oliver took a\trip
with her brother to New Tork and. did
not return until recently. The youthful
bridegroom did not accompany his wl's
on the Journey.
The, couple were married by Justice
of the Peace Magee in Sari Rafael oa
September 1 and the 'ceremony was
witnessed by Deputy County Clerk
Frank Holland. Oliver gave his age as
22 and the bride as 20.
Mr. and Mrs. Oliver have taken tip
their residence temporarily, with the
bride's father. Oliver senior says his
only objection to the marriage is his
son's youth.
The ; question remains unanswered!
Was there an elopement?
The defense in the â¢ case of. Charles
"VVyman, the alleged ballot-box stuffer,
received another '.setback j yesterday.
Judge Carroll Cook dismissed the writ
of habeas corpus and , remanded Wy
man: into custody, â¢ fixing the ball at
the same amount. Bail Tras furnished
and the accused: ballot-box' stuffer will
remain at liberty until the case comes
to â¢ trial.
Wyrrian Is charged with' having il
legally/voted in .the' name of S. H.
Mann at the primary election held on
August '9.
When the hearing of the habeas
corpus' proceedings was called Attor
ney Countryman; for the defense; Im
mediately tried for . a delay. He in
formed the court that he was riot yet
prepared with a transcript of the Police
Court proceedings" in the case-' Attor
ney Hosmer, special prosecutor, . sug
gested that the case could proceed with
the evidence at hand, but Countryman
objected. However the objection was
overruled and the hearing began.
Countryman made the same ' argu
ment used at all hearings of the case.
He maintained -that the primary elec
tion on August 9 was illegal on the
ground that it "was not ordered by the
Governor of the State or the Mayor of
San Francisco.-
The proclamation under which the
election was held was. simply' a -bit of
paper on which certain districts were
set forth, maintained Countryman. It
was neither attested nor issued .under
the hand or seal of the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners.
The defense then began an attempt
to show that Wyman had not written
the name of S. H.' Mann and that after
Wyman left the booth some one else
had sighed Mann's name.
-Judge Cook interrupted: . "It Is no
use wasting time 'trying to decide who
wrote Mann's name," said his Honor.
"That is a point for the committing
magistrate to decide. Moreover, I will
not consider anything Judge Sloss has
passed upon." :
Then Countryman ' continued â¢ on the
argument that the election was Illegal
ly held and that there was no penalty
for the offense of. which Wyman was
accused. He cited! cases to that effect,
but Judge Cook : rave his opinion that
section 64% of the Penal Code applied
to' the case.
The', point that Wyman had been
made to appear against himself in the
Police Court was emphasized by Coun
tryman. Judge v Cook admitted that
forcing . the defendant to testify in the
lower [ court might be .' illegal, but he
maintained that . an objection should
have. been madeat f the time. -
The case will probably be . taken to
the Supreme Court. -

The failure of an automobile brake to
work at a critical moment resulted in
an accident, yesterday afternoon In
which Mrs. Victor H. Metcalf. the' wife
of the Secretary of the Department of
Commerce and Labor, Philip E.
Bowles, president of the First National
Back, Mrs. Bowles and Mr. Ldttlefield,
a friend of Hr. Bowles, narrowly, es
caped serious injury. The Occident
happened on a steep hill on Baya Vista
street In Piedmont. While all the mem
bers of the party werÂ« badly shaken
up, only Mr. Bowles, who was operat
ing the machine, was injured. .
The party were enjoying a ride
through the Piedmont district and
everything went well until the auto
mobile struck the hill, which is very
Eteep. When near the top of the hill
the engine suddenly stopped and an
insu^xt later the machine began to run
backward down the hill. Mr. Bowles
at once applied thr brake, but it re
fused to work and as the" speed in
creased hÂ© realised that the car was
beyond control. Crying: to the others
to Jump, he turned the machine In
toward the bank at the side of the road.
Am the wheels, struck the curb the
shock hurled it against the bank side
ways and It was overturned.
Just before the machine ran up on
the bank Mrs. Metcalf Jumped from
the car and escaped unhurt. Mrs.
Bowles, and Mr. IJttlefleld were un-<
able to get out In time and were thrown
from the machine when it overturned,
but fortunately both fell clear of the
car. Mr. Bowles was caught beneath
the machine and received a deep., cut
on the face and a number of painful
bruises. .His injuries were not serious,
however, and he was able to attend to
business to-day.
The automobile was but little dam
aged. . It was righted and the party re
turned home but little the worse" for
the mishap". Bfe^jfe ; ; >â¢.*;Â¦-

ORDER'S ANNIVERSARY
OAKLAND, Opt. SI.â Mars and
Bacchus united last night in casting a
spell # upon the fortunes of infant Peter
Saraco, whose christenings was the oc
casion ' of a merry, riotous outbreak.
In which gleamed '"long, thin blades"
of sunny .Italy. The knife wlelders
were overheated by much . tippling in
celebration of the momentous event.
Red wine overflowed at the Saraco
christening. The friends and the neigh
bors went to I the , Saraco residence,
Thirteenth and Kirkham streets,, in
Buch . numbers that they, too, over
flowed. . After many of the visitors
had drunk toasts galore to the heir of
Saraco the crowd repaired to the more
commodious dwelling of Charles Balag-
no. 1371 Thirteenth street; There .the
red wine ran In risers* and the guests
became Joyful, noisy and then* bellig
erent.
Late in the night Giochino Ducio ran
amuck. He -flashed a knife and it Is
charged started to out John Ferraro
Into- ribbons. In the melee Duclo -was
driven' from the house only to' return
to the attack. ' Then Police Sergeant
Frank Lynch and Patrolman John
Murphy arrived, summoned by some of
the celebrating friends who had not
lost their heads. The christening party
broke up with the hauling away of
I>uolo to the City Prison. "He .forfeited

PEEMANENCE OF CUEE.
The Chief Merit. .
Many so-called pile remedies will af-
ford the user slight temporary relief,
and the majority of sufferers do not ex-
pect mere than this.' Women especial-
ly, after having tried every preparation
recommended for the cure of _ Piles,
have come to the conclusion that there
is no cure except by an operation. This
is rightfully viewed with dread, be-
cause of thÂ« shock to the delicate ner-
vous system of women, and many of
those afflicted . havÂ«' resigned them-
selves to the situation .with never a
thought that there Is any help in eight
for them. " . r
We invite the attention of all such to
thÂ» experience of the lady whose ad-
ss iz- given below.
I. feel it my duty to recommend the
ramid Pile Cure, for after suffering
a years with a most distressing form
Piles I am entirely cured, thanks to
lis remedy. Any one . doubting this
an write to Margaret . Brady, 156
Vhitman St., Cleveland, Ohio."
Ten months later she writes "I am
id to eay that I .am still perfectly
from Piles and liave not had the
test trouble since I first used your
*dy. I am well lenown in Cleveland
have advertised Pyramid Pile Cure
>Â».#nslvely here. I take pleasure in
floing so as it caved me from an opera-
tion, which I always dreaded, and you
are assured the remedy can have no
firmer advocate than JL". .
. Testimony like this should convince
the most skeptical that Pyramid '.Pile
rvire not only cures, but cures to stay
. ed. It is in the form of a supposl-
r; can be applied in the privacy of
* home directly to the parts affected
id â¢ does its work quickly .-and - pain-
issly.
Druggists sell this famous remedy for
'ty cents a package, and we urge all
\fferers to buy a package now and
re it a trial to-night. Accept no Sub-
. tutes. - *

WASHINGTON, Oct. 31.â Rear Ad
miral Charles W. Rae, engineer in
chief of the navy and chief of the Bu
reau of Steam Engineering, in his an
nual report made public at the Navy
Department* says that the present en
gineering condition in the navy is a
"cause of grave anxiety to all - conver

statistics showing the scarcity of en
gineering officers in the navy to-day
and urges special legislation with a
view to increasing the number of naval
officers available for engineering duty.
Of the turbine experiments he says:

It is believed that Italy will be found
favorable to the negotiation of arbitra
tion treaties with this country, and
also Great Britain, though in the case
of the latter country It is expected that
the Initiative this time must come from
the American Government. oi '?
It Is pointed out that while there are
few Questions of Importance pending
between this country and France, the
negotiation' of an arbitration treaty at
a time when the diplomatic horizon is
so clear will insure an early conclusion
of the convention.
"Widespread interest has been aroused
throughout the diplomatic corps by the
announcement of Secretary Hay In his
recent New York speech that the Gov
ernment hoped soon to begin the prep
aration of arbitration treaties with all
countries willing to sign tt era. There
Is already evident among European
diplomats a keen desire to take the
lead In this movement.
Sometime ago the French Govern
ment, through its Ambassador in
Washington, informed Secretary Hay
that France was readv and willing to
conclude such a convention whenever
it was the pleasure of the United
States. In view of the fact that the
elections were coming on the "Washing
ton Government expressed its ' thanks
for this renewed evidence of friendship
on the part of the French republic
and intimated a desire to open negotia
ations this winter.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 3Lâ France and
the United States expect to begin the
negotiation of an arbitration treaty in
Washington soon, after the Presidential
election.- The treaty will be known as
the Hay-Jusserand treaty, and, accord
ing to the present programme, will fol
low closely the lines of the British-
French arbitration treaty.

NEW YORK, . Oct. 31. â Testimony,

of Miss Bertha M. Dolbeer, who was
killed by/ a . fall ) from the ninth floor

given to-day by Dr., Homer ./Gibney.
Dr. r Gibney attended Miss Dolbeer im- v
mediately after her fall. Later he was*
called; to .attend; Miss Warren, the
chief ; beneficiary under Miss Dolbeer's
will, who was suffering from nervous-;
riess and shock.' -;_
He testified that from that time until
Miss Warren retired for the Â¦Â¦ night he
was constantly with her, and over
heard -.every word of the various con
versations â¢ which -. took place between
her and Coroner Scholer. 3SSSI
Dr. Â£ Gibney. said " Miss - Warren was
under such a.' great mental strain that
he advised : her to answer only enough
questions ; to enable the ' Coroner to
complete: his report. .; He,' denied that
Miss .Warren had said .that Miss Dol

that she. had been under treatment for

There are thirty-two counties in the

PRELIMINARY BATTLES.
Judge Turner can always draw and
entertain a crowd. He has been very
busy, talking day and night, until in
terrupted by a physical breakdown.
And now that the campaign is fairly
coming down, to the wire the betting,
of which there is a great deal, is
even. The betting is being exploited
by partisan newspapers and cam
paigners of both sides as a sure sign
they will win. vaSSB
Many angry men- went home .from
the Republican convention,', especially
those. who had to cross 'the mountains
Into the 'fertile wheat fields of Eastern
'Washington to. get there. ."For 'the
farmers wanted the commission and
they' didn't want to have to. vote. the'
.Democratic ticket -to get.it. Many are.
going ..to try- for it that' way this year,
however â many, I mean, who are go- '
ing to vote for.Rcrdsevelt. -When I was
'here 'a'bbut three months ago I noticed,
something- of the . high' tension under
which many ' voters wejfe working at
that time -as a result of the then re-'
cently heid con-ventjon. Many were at
that ;time willing' to wager two to one
on the Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor, former Senator George -Turner.
That their vision was more or less clear
has been since demonstrated by action
taken by.* Republican conventions in a
number of the counties, some of them
expressing indignation* at the action
of the State convention in denying
their demands, one* county actually re
pudiating the State ticket.
But another factor has entered into
.the situation ' since that, time which
has very -materially modified the bet
ting. That factor is the Republican
candidate himself. A. E. Mead, 'law-,
yer, of Whatcom County,, entered the
campaign as an unknown quantity."
He had served in the Legislature, but"
had not been noted as a State figure.
Geographical j considerations and the
strong backing of railroad interests
secured him the nomination in. that
stormy convention. Those who were
responsible for its action went away
determined to move the earth . to se
cure indorsement by the people, those
disappointed not concealing: their inten
tion to fight. In one of those "whirl
wind" campaigns which has been on
since then the Republican candidate
has developed a quality not suspected
even by some who thought they knew
him. He has proved a good vote get
ter. ' Â¦WffJyWftWttBBMKrfi

Â¦TACOMA. Oct 31.â There's nothing
to the election in the State of Wash
ingtorn so far as Roosavelt and Fair
banks is concerned, except to write out
the majority for future reference. The
national committee has called Repre
sentative Cushman, a strong campaign
er, into the doubtful fields of the East,
apparently careless of who shall be
elected Governor of this State. So far
as anybody can tell the names of
Roosevelt and Fairbanks may or may
not be on the ballot in the coming "elec
tion. Qr I should put it the other way,
perhapsâ as to whether the names of
any other Presidential candidates will
be on the ticket. The national cam
paign is, of course," referred to occa
.siohally, but "the election" here means
Mead or Turner for Governor.
It -is a warm contest. In it is. in-'
vofved "a number ef interesting ques
tions', not one of which Is allowed to
be lost sight of over night. A railroad
commissionâ yes or no â overlaps all the
others in" Importance. Fpllowing that
there is the- "successor to Senator Fos

prestige of a successful term ; he is : a
diligent man as well at home as at
Washington.-. He is going about over
the State, not saying much for pub
lication,.but making friends. These say
for him that the game is his.'
Former Senator Wilson is actively in
the campaign, both through :, the . me
dium of his newspaper and , on the
stump. A little slip in a report of .his
first speech as published In ; his own
newspaper has been the' occasion of a
gtJod deal of amusement to' onlookers,
as it gave his enemies^a club they have
used effectively. He had been speaking
of Judge Turner *and referred to * him
as having made a certain speech to se
cure for Seattle the contract for;build
ing, the battleship Nebraska,', "but nbt," :
he said, ."for the consideration of $500,"
as hadbeen the case when he spoke In
behalf of a certain 'commission bill. In
the report of .the speech in the, Post-
Intelllgencer the word '"not" was i left
out. Democratic papers that same day
took It up : under/; full-page ~ headlines,
the shipbuilders were ' interviewed }, and
entered an j emphatic- denial, Judge
Turner waa telegraphed and { his de
nunciation of the ; charge ; as ait He was
spread over the front page in [ f at type,!
all before Wilson 'could himself correct
the report and publish ', his ; frank- tele
gram to Judge Turner, pointing out the
error.
But there are other men in Seattle"
who have lived there longer and who
have- never flouted .her as W,ilson has
done once or twice. "Sam" piles, a
long- time candidate, ah' accepted rail
road man, seems to have the backing
this .time. Jacob Furth, banker .', and
capitalist, Is also spoken of. Spokane

Seattle 1 can' secure, enough votes.

But. the Democrats have hopes con
cerning the Legislature themselves.
Judge. Turner has" not been speaking
fcr himself alone on his. 'daily, rounds,
hut wjth strpng -appeal for Tom, Dick
and Harry, Democratic candidates in
their- respective legislative * districts.
For should the Legislature by any
chance- be Democratic Judge Turner
would â¢. be " made \Â§enatorâ and that's
what b/e wants to be made. Judge Tur
ner "would appreciate the honor of be
ing -Governor of this great State, of
course, but- it's Senator he" wants to be..
The struggle .for the Sena'torshlp, con,
tlngent on the complexion of the Legis
lature, -is-, very interesting. Senator.
Foster, â¢ whose' term' expires, is a *Â£i*3i
dent. of this city-. Of .course he .wishes
to succeed himself. â¢ Seattle, ".thirty
. miles away, . has ever undertaken - to
dominate the politics of the State,
which, as ft s. .most populous, city and
acquainted with, an energy that has
made proverbs, is natural enough.
Seattle has set itself to secure for one
of Its own that. seat. .It has .many can
didates. .Ex-Senator John L. Wilson
lives there. He tried for, the Senator
ship while maintaining his residence
â¢at Spokane and allowing the Post-In
telligericer, the morning dally of-Seat
tle,, which . he owns; to appeal to the
pe.ople of Seattle In his behalf.- But
he. misunderstood Seattle. Realizing
his error Wilson moved over to Seattle*,
sacrificing Spokane,, of course, and the
affections- 'of Tacoma-,- some of which
he. had won,- in order- to '.go down to
Olympia next winter as a man from
Seattle. ' â¢ ' , " â¢
All this is to indicate, the very se
rious defection that the Republicans
will have to meet in their calculations
for suocess, and also to explain- why
it is generally conceded* thaC'hbwerer
tKe election- results, a law providing
1 for a Railroad Commission will be
passed next winter. Such has been
the popular clamor and its results. The
! statement is made by Democrat and
Republican alike, and where % by the
latter it is of course a concession 'Â¦Â¦ of
?Republican error. But here comes
the Republican , campaigner to make
capital out of 'the situation. He calls
back .to their allegiance the dissent
ers of Kis party lest the election of
Judge Turner should. defeat their pur
pose â the purpose of the Republican
party â to 'put a Railroad Commission
law o*n "the books. He puts it .this
way:. Should the Legislature be Re
publican, "which In all likelihood it will
be, and â¢ the* 'Governor Democratic,
that the ' Legislature would- not feel
like putting" into the hands of < the
Governor such power as goes with* the
appointing of such a commission. That

Senator Stanton Warburton v of this
city, a strong railroad center, who has
always led. the fight for, a commission
and most any other fight against the
railroads, has taken the stump for
Turner. Many* other influential Re
publicans have announced an inten
tion to vote for him.

There may be nothing better than
cards, but for a change almost any
thing, is desirable. A needle afternoon
at this season of the year is Instructive
as well as pleasant.
Women ' have been away from home
at the sea shore, the lake shore, in the
mountains, or even off for a short visit,
and have seen many new stitches and
many new designs in embroidery. Make
this fact the basis of an entertainment.
Invite the guests for 1 o'clock luncheon
and ask them to come, prepared to
demonstrate the. newest fad in em
broidery or needlework.
There are many kinds of embroidery;
and u an afternoon . thus spent with
needles will -prove a help In making
Christmas gifts.; Any new bit of fancy
work will answer. , Every one must go
prepared and willing to teach every,
one else how to do the work she knows
how to 'do. . .'
Cards, cards, nothing but cards, after
noon and afternoon. There are neigh
borhood card parties and club parties
and luncheons followed by cards until
It seems that every one has had cards
enough to last a lifetime. But what
shall I do with my guests? asks the

The pe6ple -demand in .the .n.ext Congress workers, and not

needs every . influence .that can' advance her interests. This'- State
has a representative in : the ; Cabinet in the .department that most con
cerns our commercial welfare... Secretary Metcalfs appointment was
hailed by Republicans and. Democrats- as ah act of the President
vital to ou'r interests and prosperity.-* Let the thoughtful members
of both parties renfember that an appointment so' conspicuously use
ful deserves acknowledgment by giving to President Roosevelt the
support of a solid.delegatioh. There is niot a true California Demo
crat, who puts his State above partjÂ£- % that* would not trust Kahn,
Haj'es, Smith," McKinlay/. Knowlamf," Gillett, Needhain or Mc-
Lachlan to administer upon his .estate without bonds. This being
so, why are not these gentlemen deserving of confidence and the
right. men to be" trusted in caring 'for the interests of every man's
estate so far as it is affected by prpper and legitimate attention in
Congress? . ' "
This State has long been ambitious, to secure a .representation
in the Cabinet. But that ambition was. briefly gratified only once
by the short service of Mr. McKenna .before his promotion to the
Supreme Court, until President Roosevelt gave to us the position
'of the greatest importance to the whole Coast, and conferred it
upon the gentleman who would have been selected by popular vote,
if that method had been possible. One needs only to remember
the satisfaction expressed at Mr. Metc.alf's- appointment in the
complimentary functions, in which men of all parties took
â¢part, to understand how important it is to us. .
As the President recognized California, let the State requite him
by a vote of confidence that will send a solid Republican delegation
to the House. This is dictated by the principle of ordinary prudence.
We want a fair chance with the rest of the' country for our com
merce and business, in the things that make for their support and.
I progress. Let us not be imprudent and indifferent in such a situation.

Mrs. Henry herself took the stand
and declared that her son, Elmer, had
beaten her on occasions and that their
difficulties arose over George Monnier,
her son-in-law, who is contesting his
father's will. She said her children
sided with â¢ Monnier. Mrs. Henry's
testimony was entirely rational.
A. K. Henry, the husband, who made
the complaint, recited : many of his
wife's peculiar actions'. -. He declared
she would "say -things, that had no
foundation, in fact . Their son, Elmer
Henry, testified that- his mother, "with
out cause,, accused him of beating her.
A daughter, Mrs. â¢ Florenoe Dell who
has been In ', the Philippines until a
month ago, testified that her mother
should be confined 4n an asylum.
Â«g Mrs. Emma Hilton, Mrs, Riohard

believed . her Bane.
The inquiry into the sanity *of- Mrs.
Isabelle M:. Henry v was "brdught* to a
close yesterday morning when Judge
Hebbard Instructed the Jury, to find
her sane. This the Jurors did- without
leaving the box.
D'rs. Lustig and Wadsworth of the
Insanity 'Commission, who examined
Mrs. Henry last week, were 61 the
opinion, that her case was a "border
land" oneâthat Is, hani to distinguish
between -sanity and Insanity, and liable
to turn either way. Drs. H. W- Stire
walt " and . jbushnell, ' who attended
Violet Monnier, Mrs. Henry's daughter,
in 1901, pbserved Mrs. Henry at that
time and were both" of the opinion that
her mind was unbalanced. â¢ ..

CHICAGO. Oct. 31.â Extreme weakness char
aewrtzed the trading In wheat throughout the
entire session. - The item of early news, that'
most -strongly Impressed pi*t operators was the- 'â¢
exceeding heaviness of Russian shipments for
last week, exports from that country being
6,144,000 bushels. Total , world's exports were
nearly .1LOOO,000. bushels, which was one and
a Half million bushels more than had been esti
mated by a leading English crop statistician..
The domestic situation was equally as bearish '
There were reports from the Northwest that
receipts, instead of becoming 'smaller in the"
near future, were likely to become larger. -The
weakness of all cash markets and the poor de
mand for flour' was an addlUonal source of
ciECOurageraent'to holders. At the opening the
December option was off VJc to Uc at $1 ll*i
to $1 '11%.- May was- down a shade toUSVe
at $1 10% to SI 11. Heavy selling pressure
waa brought- to bear on the December delivery
the liquidation continuing : heavy from start
to. finish. With an entire absence of demand
of any tdsquate sort prices steaaily declined.
The â¢ final quotations on December -were' at
$1 10*4*?$l 10*4. a net loss of 1*491 Â«&c. May
closed 4c down. at $1 10?4. '- . ' '. â¢ Â¦
Considering the sharp break In wheat prices,
the corn ' market held remarkably firm. De
cember closed at 48 %c. -w
Oats were a trifle easier. December closed
%c lower at 2S%c " * . '
Â¦ The feature of 'trading" in 'lard Wai* a -drop
of 40 cents In theprlctt. of October lard. At
