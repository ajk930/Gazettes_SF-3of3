CHICAGO, Sept. 25.-Â»-"Stand pat on
practically all of the present national
policies, but change your national
leaders," is the advice to the American
voters, paraphrased from the famous
message of the late Senator Hanna,
given ' by judge Alton Brooks Parker,
in his letter of acceptance of the
Democratic nomination for President.
At the outset he takes pains again
to declare "my unqualified belief in
the gold standard." On the tariff â
callÂ«d the "robber tariff" by the St.
Louis platform, he expresses a belief
in the necessity of revision, but adds
that such revision should be accom
plished "without disturbing business
conditions," and naively couples this
with the reiterated declaration that
such revision would be impossible,
even if he should win, as of necessity
the United States Senate must remain
Republican during the next four years.
"Stand pat" on political, legislation
on the trusts is also his advice, his
reason being that, in his judgment, thte
existing laws, together with the rem
edies afforded by common law, are
adequate to deal with the problem.

bansia avenue, yesterday waiting for
his body, which she had identified at
the North Side. Morgue, to be brought
to the house, when in walked Ignatz
in his usual good health. THe mother
almost swooned at . the Bight, and
neighbors, who had come in to con
sole the woman, stood speechless.
Ignatz, who is 29 years of age, had
not even heard the report that he was
dead and was at a loss to understand
why his appearance should cause con
sternation. Then it was explained
that Mrs. Matezki, not having seen
him for some ''tvs, read of a suicide
which answered his description and
went to see the body, which she mis
takenly identified as his. Ignatz at
once got busy canceling orders for a
coffin, carriages and flowers and to
day there was joy in that house in
stead of a funeral.

' Since the beginning, of Jthe bombard

Fort Kuropatkin is situated to the

CHEFU, Sent. 25â As a result of the
battle before Port Arthur^ which began
on September 13, the Japanese succeed
ed in capturing several important posi
tions, and to-day the Russian tenure of
the big forts guarding the north,
northeast and northwest sides of the
â¢town- is seriously threatened. Chinese
information places the Japanese losses
under 3000 for the three .flays" fighting.

is due to the excessive care used by the

MjPossibly the most important capture
dtfrins the three days* fighting was
that of Fort Kuropatkin, which, while
of minor value with regard to prevent
ing the entrance into the town of the
Japanese, had been constructed for the
purpose of protecting the. source of the
garrison's water supply. The control
of this water supplv is now > in the
hands of the Japanese. S
As was announced in these dis
patches on September, 20, the battle be
gaivbefore daybreak on September 19.
At that hour the citizens arM garrison
of Port Arthur, after the enjoyment of
weeks of comparative security, .awoke,
to the thunderous reports of artillery
along the line extending from the west
of Itz Mountain to Rlhlung and Kik

The arrival of the distinguished par
ty, who had come directly through
from Bath. Me., in a private car, was
anticipated by the hotel people, where
â¢they were due at 5 o'clock. The train
was delayed, and by the time they ar
rived the his court of the hotel was
filled w?th a large crowd anxious to get
a. glimiJ&e of the man famous as the
president of the steel trust and or
ganizer of the shipbuilding trust. Re
'teiver Smith was the first of the party
to arrive at the hutel. He immediately
vent to the counter to receive a large
pile of mail that was waiting for him,
and then excusing himself from all who
\u25a0wished to see him on the plea that he
"was fatigued retired to his apartments
and denied himself to all callers.
Schwab arrived soon after ward. When
he walked into the hotel men and
wbmen stood up endeavoring to get a
glimpse of this man who had received
eo much notoriety. He managed to
work his way up to the hotel counter.
After he had placed h:s name on the
â¢â¢register he announced his intention of
taking a Turkish bath and with several
of hie friends he startec out with that
purpose in view. He was in the finest
pcfcsib'e vein of humor and received
every' on* with a broad, good-natured
smile and a hearty toandshake. In
tpeaking of the reorganization of the
ehipbuilding combine he said:
"I am the sole owner of 70 per cent
of the shares of the new organization.
In this corporation are fifteen million
shares of preferred bUtcX and fifteen
million shares of common stock. This
new organization owns all the ship
building properties that were in the.
old company with the exception of the
Harlan and ilollinssworth Company
"end the Union Iron Wonts of this city.
These two are not at present in our
organization. Th>? sal? of the Union
-Iron Works takes place to-day, and
while I am not h*re to make a bid I
am naturally interested in the sale. I
have come a-'ross the continent straight
Irom Bath, Maine. My party is com
posed entirely of my friends. First i
comes A. J. Spicgelmire, who Is the
f.rrt man I e\*er worked for and one
of my most valued friends.
"There is also with me W. W. Green,
whu comes here representing the Mer

Dr. Edward Powers. I have no inten
tion at present of making a visit to the
Tonopah country, my present plans be
inp to remain here until to-morrow
nipht and then go directly East." .
As Schwab owns TO per cent of the
ptock of the new organization he has
full control of It, and if he acquires
the Union Iron Works and the Harlan
& Holiingsworth plant, which is to be
sold at auction during the first week in
October, he will be in absolute control
of the Ehin-building industry of this
country. He hopes, having this end in
view, that with the acquisition of these
two last-named plants he will be able
to place the successor to the original
Ehip-buildicg trust on a paying basis.
Charles M. Schwab, former president
of the United States Steel Corporation,
and ex-Senator James Smith Jr., re
ceiver for the United States Shipbuild

A number of citizens, attracted by
the fusillade, armed with guns, surv

opened fire on the desperado, who re
turned the fire, firing at everybody that
Ehowed in sight. B'inally Deputy Sher

buckshot, brought the robber to earth.
During the melpe the holdup's two
companions escaped in the gathering

accompanied by Fitzgerald, approached
the section house, when one of the des
peradoes, with a revolver in his hand,
beckoned Sweet to enter. As the depu
ty crossed the threshold the holdup
fired at close range, and, striking the
dt puty in the forehead, he fell forward
on his face into the house, the wound
proving fatal within an hour. The
robber then sprang over the prostrate
body of the deputy and with an oath
started after Fitzgerald, who ran for
the adjoining section house, a short
distance away, which he reached and
locked the door behind him. After fir
ing two shots through the door the
robber broke the door down, and, cor
nering Fitzgerald, shot him three times,
emptying his revolver, arter which he
beat him into insensibility with the
weapon. He then sprang through a
window and started up the railroad

With the purpose of forcing the war with Japan to a speedy termination, the Czar has taken steps to reorganize and reinforce the fighting force in the Far East. A second army is to be created un
der command of General Grippenberg, a veteran of many wars, and it is expected that within a comparatively short time an army aggregating 600,000 to 700,000 men will be ready to take the aggressive
against the Japanese. It is believed that Grand Duke Nicholas Michaelovitch will be made commander in chief of the Eussian armies>jn the Far East, with a soldier of more varied experience as his chief of
staff. Severe fighting at Port Arthur is reported to have taken place on September 19-21 and several important strongholds are said to have been captured by the Japanese, who shut off the garrison's water
supply. Heavy firing was heard also on September 24, but details of the fighting at this time are lacking.

General Grippenberg was educated at
home and passed through no military
school. He won his first commission
while fighting in defense of Sebastopol
and then came into prominence in , the
campaigns in Turkestan In 1863 and
1868, where he won the St. George
cross and was promoted to a*captain
cy. He was severely wounded in this
campaign. He went into the Turkish
war as a colonel and as a reward for
his service was appointed aide-de
camp to the Emperor. He again won
the St. George cross and was promoted
to the rank of major general. He be
came a lieutenant general in 1S90, a
general of infantry in 1901, and re
cently was appointed general aide-de
camp to the Emperor. .. ..
While General Grippenberg's distin
guished war record is sufficient to ex
plain the appointment, it is believed
that Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky's rec

direction. The Prince . and General
Grippenberg served several â¢ years in
Vilna, the former as Governor General
and the latter as commander-in-chief
of .the troops there. The appointment
is none the less a surprise,

During the night the heavy bombard
ment of the Russian positions contin
ued, the Japanese fire being directed
with particular vigor against another
supplementary fort 3000 yards - to the
west of the fort, on Itz Mountain and
regarded as highly Important because
of its bearing on the Itz and Anshu
Mountain forts. The next day, after
having pounded this position unmerci
fully, and until its fire had slackened
visibly, the Japanese delivered their
assault. They met with a stubborn re
sistance. They were exposed to the
fire of machine guns and rifles, and
they made frantic efforts to reach the
crestof. the slope. They leaped over
trenches and - embankments and tore
down the entanglements' in their path
until, at length they entered the fort.
The Russian troops there refused to
desert their position,. even in the face
of the superior numbers which con
fronted them, and desperate hand-to
hand fighting occurred inside the fort.
Eventually almost the entire Russian
garrison was either killed or wounded.
Military experts here are of the opin
ion that if the Japanese capture either
the Rihlung or Kikwan forts or the Itz
now threatened from a new quarter,
as well as from Palichuang.
At 5 o'clock -on the afternoon of the
20th the Japanese captured a supple
mentary fort, which from the lower
ground threatens the fort on Itz Moun
tain. This ended the heavy fighting v for
that day, , although the Japanese later
were compelled to rbsist several sorties.

MUKDEN, Sept. 25. â The halt in
active operations around Mukden Is
believed* to 'be due not only to the
.fatigue of the Japanese troops and the
slowness in getting up necessary ad
ditional supplies, but to a distinct un
derstanding between the Chinese and
Japanese that there shall be n<\ blood
shed near the "Holy City." where' the
Chinese Emperors are buried.'. It is
expected, however, that' there will be
fighting north or northeast of Mukden,
possibly on a larger scale even than at
Liaoyang.

with 100 tons of coal, have sailed
from here, ostensibly for Libau. The

As the Chinese from whom the corre

whether the battle was renewed on the

and Antsu forts the doom of Port Ar
thur Is sealed, and for this reason the
importance of the results obtained by
the Japanese in their. latest assaults
upon the Russian positions is obvious.
The Japanese are throwing up strong
intrenchment at Bentsiaputze and are
massing troops there, showing the
great importance they attach to the
protection of their right flank against
the masses of Russian cavalry, which
were sent out to guard aguinst any
surprises on the part of the Japanese.
It has been learned that the torpedo
boat destroyer Ryeshitelni sank while
being towed away by the Japanese, a
fact that causes great rejoicing in thÂ»
navy.
To Generals Meyerdorff and Bllder
ling has been confided the responsibil
ity of stopping' General Kuroki. ,As
General Meyerdorff commands the
troops from the St.' Petersburg district^
the keenest interest is felt here as to
the results. â¢â¢â â¢' '\u25a0/; "'-'^
General Kurokl is again displaying
great activity, endeavoring to circle
around the Russian left flank ana
threaten the line of retreat, in the
meantime avoiding carefully the pre
pared Russian defenses. Havingcrossed
the Hun River, much higher up thai,
the Fushan ford, he is taking a direct
line to Tie Pass. His intention is to
repeat his Liaoyang tactics. There is
seme delay in this forward move
ment, owing to the extensive prepa
rations necessary in trying onceagain
to force a decisive battle.
This deposes General Kuropatkin
from the position of commander-in
chief, for in the future he ranks on an
equal footing with General Grippen
berg.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 25. â The
sensation of the day is the publication
of an imperial ukase, in which the
Emperor announces that, as the Jap
anese have shown such unexpected
fighting powers, it is necessary for
Russia to create a second army, the
command of which he gives to Gen
eral Grippenberg, a man of immense
experience arflJ exceedingly active. In

including the defences of Vladivostok.
General Kuropatkin deems it wise
to make public unofficial advices which
indicate that Marquis Oyama Is slow
ly continuing to advance. His ten
dency seems to be to the northeast.
This may be prompted by recognition
of China's superstitious reverence for
Mukden, the Japanese being anxious
to remain on the best terms with the
Chinese. It is also likely that the pres
ence of the Hun River in front of Muk
den has convinced the Japanese of the
impossibility, from a strategic point
of view, of making a frontal attack,
while if they succeed in gaining a foot-
Ing at Fu Pass or some other point on
the north side of the river and north
of Mukden, they will render Kuropat
kin's position practically untenable and
force him to evacuate without fighting,
retire northward and give battle else
where, should he decide to contest the
Japanese advance.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 26.â The
reiteration of the now ramiliar official
statement that the military situation
is unchanged is believed to indicate
merely that, in view of the shifting of
the forces, the probability of fresh im

LONDON, Sept. 26.â Interest in the
fate of Port Arthur has grown so keen
as to overshadow the significance of
Russia's decision to organize a second
army, which, as the Daily Telegraph
remark?, together with the Emperor's
remarkable letter to General GriDDen
berg. shows that Russia at last has
awakened to the magnitude of her task
and the character of her foe. It is as
sumed by the paper that General Ku
roki is carrying out some important
Srning movement, but owing to the se
ecy of the Japanese it is regarded as
useless to indulge in speculation. \u25a0
.The Daily Telegraph's St. Petersburg:
correspondent regards the Emperor's
rescript as a brilliant victory for Vice
roy Alexieff and declares that the real
reason for the Emperor's decision was
General Kuropatkin's failrue to carry
out his plans at Liaoyang.
General Grippenberg will leave for

perience has been as a cavalry com

importance. A counselor with wide
actual experience In general command
will become an imperative necessity.
Generals DragomirofL Vorentzoff and

the Turkish war, are mentioned for the

Grand Duke Nicholas is still a young
manâ not yet 45â with much of his
father's dash, energy and resolution.
There is reason to believe that, even
with the memory of the horrors of the
Shipka winter campaign against the
Turks, of which he was the witness as
a young captain of cavalry, he would
favor a winter campaign against the
Japanese.
The dispatch of the Grand Duke as
cemmander of both armies would ac
cord with the traditions of the Roman
off dynasty, a member Â«f which Im
perial family has always been in com
mand in all of Russia's great wars.
There are various reports regarding
Viceroy Alexleff's ultimate destiny. It
is declared in some quarters that he
will be recalled and Grand Duke Nich
olas become Viceroy as well as cora
â¢ mander in chief. It is also said upon
apparent equal authority that Alexieff
will return as Chancellor of the Em
pire, succeeding Count Lamsdorff.
* None of these reports are definitely
â¢confirmed.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 26. â The

mobilized for immediate dispatch to
the Far East The Emperor is person
ally convinced that the political as
veil as the military prestige of the
empire is at stake and that every
f m other consideration must give way be
fore'the exigencies of war. The. re
sources of the empire in men- ami
. money must be drained, if necessary,
in order to turn the scale and vindi
cate the iiuv.it of Russia. The reor
ganization amounts to formal notice
to the world, as the Emperor frankly
explains in his rescript, that he in
tends to vastly increase the number of
troops at the theater of war, in
. order to force the struggle to a suc
cessful issue in the shortest possible
lime. It is intended to silence def
â¢ Inilely all talk of foreipn'intervention
by the announcement that Russia
means to fight out the issue with Ja
â¢ pan on the field of battle.
â¢ Probably 300.000 additional men
will be placed in the field. Five
corps â the Third, Fourth, Fifth,
Eighth and Sixteenth â are already
'destined for the front, and the talk
is that five more corps will be sent
.forward.
Eventually the creation of this sec
ond army involves the selection of a
o commander-in-chief. Not only js there
jjo intimation in the rescript that Gen
eral Kuropatkin will have command
o of both armies, but he is distinctly
placed upon the same footing as Gen
eral Grippenberg. In the best in
formed circles there is little idea that
Viceroy Alexieff, the present nominal
commander-in-chief. will exercise the
actual functions of commander of the
â¢ toO. 000 or 700,000 men that Russia
has resolved to nut in the field.
It is the best opinion that Grand

tor general of cavalry, will attain the
high command, occupying in the war
with Japan the position held by his
father in the war with Turkey.

OYAMA FLANKING MUKDEN.
TOKIO, Sept. 25.â An increasing
feeling of sobriety and seriousness
marks the popular attitude toward the
war. It la doubtful that the masses
appreciated in tffe beginning the seri
ousness of the 'task of expelling Rus
sia from Manchuria. They had an
easy confidence in the ability of the
army and navy to reduce the fortress
of Port Arthur, destroy the Russian
fleet and crush General Kuropatkin.
The prolongation of the siege, the
losses before Port Arthur and General
Kuropatkin's escape at Liaoyang have
brought a general appreciation of the
magnitude of the national task and dis
sipated the growing hopes of an early
peace, based on the confidence of
sweeping victories.
Events at Port Arthur" and Liaoyang
have impressively warned the Japanese
people to prepare for a long and try
ing war. Confidence in the final out
come, however, remains unshaken and
the nation has resolutely and deter
minedly settled down, prepared to
make sacrifices and pay the price that
success demands. Â» â¢
The strain of war and the drain
upon the country's resources have not
yet been felt to any extent among the
people. Some lines of business are suf
fering, but the aggregate foreign and
domestic trade exceeds that of 1903.
The crops, particularly rice, are the
largest ever grown. Death from
wounds and sickness has overtaken
thousands of soldiers, but their vacant
places have been quickly filled. The
supply of able-bodied men anxious to
fight equals all possible demands. Mu
nitions, supplies and money in hand
indicate the ability of the country to
wage war without embarrassment ana
vigorously for another year. The com
pletion during the winter of a light
railway between Antung and Liaoyang
will give the army three lines of sup
plies.
There is general confidence in the
ability of Field Marshal Marquis
Oyama to drive General Kuropatkin
Into Harbin and to successfully resist
a reinvasion of Manchuria. The early
possession of Port Arthur also is con
fidently expected. .
There is no gloom among the people.
They are simply sobered in the face of
the great and unfinished task.

Count Benckendorff, the Russian Em

reaching the highest quarters here in

quest Great Britain for a protocol de
fining British intentions in Tibet. It
is confirmed that Great Britain and
Russia had written understandings
relative to the British expedition! at
Tibet. It was at first supposed that
the recent British-Tibetan treaty car
ried out this understanding, but the
publication of the text of the treaty
h-ads to the belief in Russian, official
circles tht Great Britain seeks a poli
tical foothold beyond the terms of the
understanding. Therefore representa
tions have been made with the view or
securing a protocol exactly defining
and limiting the British sphere. This
is expected to be accomplished by an
amicable exchange of notes, not in
volving a renewal of the Anglo-Run

SANTA ROSA, Sept. 25. â A divorce
granted Saturday to Christine J.
O'Brien from Edward P. O'Brien. The
couple were married April 14, 1900,
in Manila. With her husband's con
sent the* bride embarked the day fol
lowing on a vessel bound for San
Francisco. She was to come to this
State for the benent of her health and
return to her husband later. Loving
epistles came from O'Brien until his
wife announced her readiness to re-
Ujrn home. Then he wrote her to re
main here for a time, as he expected
to leave the islands for good.
This ended the letters from Manila
and shortly afterward the husband
came to this country. He failed to
seek his wife, hence the divorce action.

My Frleada: I am called upon and privi

haa&a calls a "salutation." I give it to you
from m. full heart in the holy name of him
whao, amid nil our differences we aerre, our
Bishop Satterlee. after thanking the
Archbishop for his presence and for
his comiiig across the water to show
his Interest and earnest desire for
greater Christian unity, presented the
primate, who ra&de a brief address.
The Archbishop's salutation follows:
WASHINGTON. Sept. 25. â Most
Rev. Thomas Randall Davidson. Arch
bishop of Canterbury, sounded a stir
ring: appeal for Christian unity at the
open-air service held in the Cathe
dral grounds at Mount Saint Albans
this afternoon- Not since President
McKinley was present at the erection
of the Peace cross on the same spot
after the war with Spain, have as
many people gathered at the pic
tnresqua spot. The crowd was esti
mated at from 20,000 to 25,000. Mrs.
Roosevelt. Mrs. J. "West Roosevelt,
M!Â«n^ Ethel Roosevelt and the British
Ambassador, Sir Henry Mortimer
Durand, with Mrs. Davidson. General
and Mrs. Chaffee and Mrs. Hitchcock
had seats to the right of the platform
and joined heartily in the service.
On the platform were prominent
laymen, including J. P. Morgan of
New York, Secretary Hitchcock and
President Gllman of the Carnegie In
stitute and clergy from the various
Protestant churches In Washington.
The Times' unusual action in advis
ing the Conservatives to vote against
the Government candidate on such
grounds created a sensation In political
and other circles and attracted public
interest in the contest to a degree and
in a personal way that few bye-elections
ever call forth. Many persons thought
Marks would withdraw, but, on the con
trary, he retorted with a bitter personal
attack upon the Time3 and Walter, Its
proprietor, declaring that the asper
sions on his honor were entirely due
to the alleged exposure by the Finan
cial News of the "dishonest methods"
employed In the sale of the Times' edi
tion of the Encyclopedia Brltannica.
"For some years past," says the Fin
ancial News, "Mr. Walter has been en
gaged, in company with an American,
gentleman named Hooper, in the sale
of an out-of-date encyclopedia. For the
first time In its history one of the
greatest of English newspapers has
been employed for the furtherance of a
personal feud."
Both from the election platform and
in his newspaper Marks challenges the
Times to bring a libel suit against him
for his characterization of the Times'
encyclopedia methods as "dishonest."
The matter, to which lengthy edito
rials have been devoted, gained further
interest by the publication to-day of a
letter from the Archbishop of Canter
bury to the vicar of Margate, replying
to one in which the vicar said he felt
he must oppose Marks on "other than
political grounds." The Archbishop
says he Is ignorant of the facts in re
lation to Marks and therefore must not
be understood as expressing an opinion
In this particular case; "but," he adds,
"I am firmly persuaded that if our pub
lic life is to be maintained at its high
level and our public men are to justify
the confidence we have been accus
tomed to place in them, voters must
see to It that political or partisan en
thusiasm does not lead them to record
votes for men whom they do not trust
or respect. Unless we adhere unswerv
ingly to this principle there will be a
lowering of the tone and integrity of
our public life, and no temporary vic
tory at the polls of one political party
or the other could compensate for such
a national disaster."
LONDON, Sept 25.â An extraordinary
element has been introduced into Eng
lish politics in connection with the can
didacy of Harry Marks in the pending
bye-election in the island of Thanet.
Marks, who from 1871 to 1883 was a
newspaper reporter in New York and
who now is the wealthiest owner of tha
Financial News of this city, has been
adopted by the local Conservative As
sociation as its candidate. This action
caused a disagreement, several promi
nent local Conservatives refusing to
support him on account of his failure in
1890 In a criminal .action which he
brought against a man who circulated
various charges. The local committee
Investigated privately and declared that
Marks was a fit person to return to
Parliament, where he sat In 1895-1900.
The agitation, however, increased and
was much ventilated in the press, and
was brought to a head by a lengthy
editorial in the London Times on
Thursday, which broke away from par
ty ties and declared it was "better for
the Government to lose a seat than be
associated in the cause of Unionism
with a man who gives no public ade
quate refutation of such charges as
have been publicly made against Marks.
There are incidents in his career which,
so long as they are not explained, ought
to debar the electors of Thanet from
conferring the honor and trust of Par
liament upon him."

The two leading parties have always dif
fered as to the principles of customs taxation
Our party has always advanced the theory that
the object Is the raising of revenue for sup
port of the government, whatever other re
sults may Incidentally Cow therefrom. The
Republican party, on the other hand, contends
that customs duties ehould be levied primarily
for protection, so-called, with revenue as the
subordinate purpose, thus using the power cf
taxation to build up the business and property
of the few at the expense of the many
This difference of principle still subsists,
but our party appreciates that the long-con
tinued policy of the country, as manifested In
its statutes, makes It necessary that tariff re
form should be prudently and sagaciously un
dertaken, on scientific principles, to the end
â¢that there should not be an Immediate rev
olution in existing conditions.
In the wcrds of our platform, we demand "a
revision and a gradual reduction of the tariff
by the friends of the masses, and for the com
jr.on weal, and not by the friends of its
abuses. Its extortions and discriminations."
â¢ In my resifcnse to your committee I pointed
out the method under which a gradual reduc
tion of customs duties may be accomplished
without disturbing business conditions. I de
cue again to express the opinion that this
method should be followed.
It 1* true that the Republicans, who do not
admit in their platform that the Dlngley tariff
needs the slightest alteration, arc likely to
retain a majority of the Federal Scnato
throughout the next Presidential term, and
could, therefore. If they choose, block every
attempt at legislative relief. But it should be
remembered that the Republican party includes
many revisionists, and I believe that it will
shrink from defying the popular will ex
pressed unmistakably and peremptorily at the
ballot box.
For the above-mentioned reasons, among
many others, the people demand reform of
these abuses, and such reform demands and
should receive immediate attention
Even now the argument most frequently
urged In behalf of. the Dingley tariff, and
against tariff reform generally, is the neces
sity of caring for our infant industries. Many
of these industries. afte r a hundred years of
lusty growth, are looming up as industrial
giants. In their case, at least, the Dingley
tariff Invites combination and monopoly and
gives Justification to the expression that the
tariff Is the mother of trusts.
TARIFF REFORM.
Tariff reform Is one of the cardinal prin
ciples of the Democratic faith, and the neces
sity f" it was never greater than at the pres
en*. tiire. It should be undertaken at once
in the Ii,ter<>st o* all our people.
The Dingley tariff is excessive in many of
its rates, and. an to them at least, unjustly
and oppressively burdens the people. It secures
to domestic manufacturers, singly or In com
bination, the privilege of exacting excessive
prices at home and prices far above the level
of sales made regularly by them abroad with
prcfit. thus giving a bounty to foreigners : t
the expense of our own people. Its unjust
taxation burdens the people generally, forcing
them to pay excessive pricas for fool. fuel,
clothing and other necessaries of life. It
levies duties on many articles not normally
imported in any considerable amount, which
are made extensively at home, for wht.?h thi
most extreme protectionist would hardly Jus
tify protective taxes, and which In large
amount* are exported. Such duties have been
and will continue to be a direct Incentive to
the formation o f huge Industrial combinations,
which, secure from foreign competition, are
enabled to stifle domestic competition and
practically to monopolize the home market.
It contains many duties imposed for the ex
press purpose only, as was openly avowed of
furnishing a basis for reduction by means of
reciprocal trade treaties, which the Republi
can 'administration implied, or at least prom
ised to negotiate. Having on this promise,
spurred on by protected interests, defeated the
treaties negotiated by the executive, now
these same interests cling to the benefit of
these duties, which the people never intended
they should have, and to which they have no
mcral right.
The magnitude of the country and its di-
VTslty of interests and population would en
nhlr a determined. ambitious and able
executive, unmindful of constitutional limita
tions and fired with the lust of power, to go
far In the usurpation of authority and the
aggrandizement of personal r>ower before the
situation could be fully appreciated or the peo
ple bÂ« aroused.
The issue of Imperialism which has been
thrust upon the country involves a decision
whether the laws of the land or the rule of
Individual caprice shall govern. The principle
of Imperialism may give rise to brilliant, start
ling, dashing results, but the principle of
democracy holds In check the brilliant execu
tive and subjects him to the sober, conserva
tive control of the people.
The people of the United States stand at
the partlne of the ways. Shall we follow the
footsteps of our fathers along the paths cf peace,
prosperity and contentment, guided by the
ever-living spirit of the constitution which they
framed for us, or shall we eo along other and
untried paths, hitherto shunned by all, follow
ing blindly new ideals, which, though appeal
ing with brilliancy to the imagination and am
bition, may Drove a will o' the wisp, leading
us into difficulties from which It may be im
possible to extricate ourselves without lasting
injury to our national character and Institu
tions.
EXECUTIVE POWER.
Gentlemen: In my response to your com
mittee, at the formal notification proceedings,
I referred to some matters not mentioned In
this letter. I desire that these be considered
as incorporated herein, and regret that lack of
space prevents specific reference to them all.
1 wish here, however, again to refer to my
views there expressed as to the gold standard,
to declare again my unqualified belief In said
standard, and to express my appreciation of
the action of the convention in reply to my
communication upon that subject.
Grave public questions are pressing for de
cision. The Democratic party appeals to the
people with confidence that its position on
these questions will be accepted and indorsed
at the polls. While the issues Involved are
numerous, some stand forth pre-eminent in
the public mind. Among those are tariff re
form, Imperialism, economical administration
and honesty in public service. I shall briefly
consider these' and some others within the
necessarily prescribed limit* of this letter.
While I presented my views at the noti
fication proceedings concerning this vital Issue,
the overshadowing Importance of the question
impels me to refer to it again. The issue is
oftentimes referred to as constitutionalism vs.
imperialism.
If we would retain our liberties and consti
tutional rights unimpaired, we cannot permit
or tolerate, at any time or for any purpose,
the arrogation of unconstitutional powers by
the executive branch of our Government. We
should be ever mindful of the words of Web
ster. "Liberty is only to be preserved by
maintaining constitutional restraints and Just
divisions of political powers."
Already the national Government has become
centralized beyond any point contemplated or
imagined by the framers of the constitution.
How tremendously all this has added to the
power of the President.
It has developed from year to year until it
almost equals that of many monarchs. While
the growth of our country and the magnitude
of interstate interests may st*"m to furnish a
plausible reason for the centralization of power,
yet these same facts afford the most potent
reason why thÂ« executive should not be per
mitted to encroach upon the other departments
of the Government and assume legislative or
other powers not expressly conferred by the
constitution.

mittee, etc. â
MESSAGE TO THE VOTERS.
Only upon the Issues of the Philip
pines and on pensions does he deviate
from his attitude of "standing pat" on
Republican policies. Regarding the isl
ands in the far Pacific he says:
"I am in hearty accord with that
plank in our platform that favors do
ins for the Filipinos what we have al
ready done for the Cubans, and I favor
making the promise to them that we
shall take such action as soon as they
are reasonably prepared for it."
Veterans of the Civil War will be es
pecially interested in his declaration
that, if elected, he will revoke the age
limit order on pensions recently issued
by President Roosevelt. He explains
that he will do this, not because it
was not founded upon right and jus
tice, but because such order is a usur
pation of legislative authority by the
President. Once revoked, he promises,
his attention will be devoted to secur
ing legislation in accord with order,
his theory being that such pensions
should not of right come "from indi
vidual largess, but from national Jus
tice."
I solicit the cordial co-operation and generous
assistance of every man, who believes that a
change of measures and of men at this time
will be wise, and urxe harmony of endeavor
as well as vigorous action on the part of all so
minded. â¢
The issues are Joined and the people must
render the verdict.
Shall economy of administration be demanded
or shall extravagance be encouraged?
Shall tho wrong doer be brought to bay by
the people, or must justice wait on political
oligarchy?
Shall our Government stand for equal op
portunity, or for special privilege?
Shall It remain b. Government of law, or be
come one of Individual caprice?
Shall we cllns to the rule of the people, or
shall we embrace beneficent despotism?
With calmness and confidence we await the
people's vrdiut.
If calleJ to the office of President, I shall
consider myself the chief magistrate of all the
people and not of any faction, and shall ever
be mindful of the fact that on many questions
of national policy there are honest differences of
opinion. 1 believe in the patriotism, good sense
and absolute sincerity of all the people. I
shall strive to remember that he may serve
his party best who serves his country best.
If it be the wish of the people that I under
take the duties of the Presidency, I pledge
myself, with God's help, to devote all my
powers and energy to the duties of the exalted
office. Very truly yours,
ALTON B. PARKER.
I have out aside congenial work In which I
had expected to devote my life in order to
assume as best I Can the responsibility your
convention put upon me. s
Reform In expenditures must be had In the
civil, military and naval establishments In
order that the national expenditures may be
brought to a baEia of peace and the Govern
ment maintained without recourse to the taxes
of wp.r.
Official extravagance is official crime.
TJpere is not a sentence in the Republican
platform recommending a reduction In the ex
penditures of the Government; not a line
suggesting that the Increase in the cost of
tho War Department from $34,000,000 in 1896
to fllO.OOO.COO In 190-1 should be Inquired
into; and not a paragraph calling for a thor
ough investigation of these departments of the
Government in which dishonesty has been re
cently disclosed.
The people, however, can by their votes, if
they desire It, order such an Investigation and
inaugurate a policy of economy and retrench
ment. It Is safe to say that this will not be
accomplished by indorsing at the polls the
Reoubllcan majority of the House of Repre
sentatives, which refused the investigation
and made the - appropriations, nor by con
tinuing the power of the administration which
made the disbursements.
The expenses of the first four years succeed
ing the last Democratic administration amount
ed to the enormous average of $511,000,000 per
year. This large expenditure was due to a
considerable extent to the ccst of the Spanish-
American war, which occurred during that pe
riod; but the termination of that war brought
no relief to the Treasury, for the average an
nual expenses of the Government during tha
three subsequent years ending June 30, 1904,
were about $519,000,000 which is the largest
sum hitherto reached during a like period
since the close of the Civil War.
The draft upen the revenues of the country
has had the effect which might have been an
ticipated, and now we have presented the re
verse of the situation, wh/ch led to the famous
observation, "It is a condition, and not a
theory, which confronts us"; for, although the
incumbent found at the close of the
first fiscal year, during which he assumed
control of the administration, a surplus of re
ceipts .over expenditures of more than $01,
000,000. there was an excess of expenditures
over receipts at the close of the last fiscal
year of $41,000,000, and the official monthly
reports made by the Treasury Department show
that the expenditures are continually and rap
idly increasing, while the receipts are dimin
ishing.
In this connection it Is Interesting to note
the recent administrative orders forbidding
Government officers from making public any
statement of estimates on which future ap
propriations are to be based.
If a man of ordinary intelligence and pru
dence should find in the operating expenses of
his business such a tremendous percentage of
increase would he not promptly set on foot
an inquiry for the cause of the waste and
take immediate measures to stop it, especially
when trusted employes have been found dis
honest and convicted and a widespread Im
pression exists that a thorough investigation
may discover other cases of malfeasance?
When the chief executive reported to Con
gress that "through lrauds, forgeries and per
juries and by shameless briberies the laws
relating to the proper conduct of the public
service in general and to the administration
of the Postofflce Department have been no
toriously violated," M â¢ â¢ there was a gen
eral popular demand for a rigid, sweeping
investigation by Congress, In addition to that
undertaken fcy the chief executive himself.
Such an investigation the Republican majority
in Congress would not permit, aitbough the
minority insisted that the Interests of good
covernment demanded it. And the minority
was right. The liberality, patriotism and
national pride of the people should not be
made an excuse for waste of the public funds.

past show. The Panama route having been
selected, the building of the canal should be
pressed to completion with . all reasonable ex
pedition.
PANAMA CANAL.
A vast expanse of country in the West,
portions of which are to be found in each
of the sixteen States and Territories men
tioned In the law, Is directly affected by the
national statute â the outcome of Intelligent
and persistent efforts of leading citizens, pro
viding for the reclamation of the arid lands
for the benefit of homtseekers. During the
years of the development of the measure which
finally received the vote of every member of
the upper house of Congress, it encounters op
position based to a large extent upon tne
views that the aim of its promoters was to
secure the benefits of Irrigation to private
owners at Government expense. The aim of
the statute Is, however, to enable this vast
territory to reclaim its arid lands without
calling upon the taxpayers of the country at
large to pay for It. Whether the purposes
of the bill will be fully accomplished must
depend in large measure upon the abllltAso
briety of Judgment, independence and Hon
esty of the officers of the Interior Department
having this great work In charge. In 19CJ
the main canals and ditches In the region
affected aggregate more than 69,000 miles and
the work of reclamation is but in Its infancy.
The total cost of construction of the necessary
hcad^atea. dams, main canals, ditches, reser
voirs and pumpinr stations was at that time
a little over $'J3.000, 000, which of Itself sug
cests the hundreds of millions that may
eventually be Invested In the territory cov
ered by the statute. The magnitude of the
conception and the enormous expense its carry
inr out Involves makes us realize the over
whelming importance of a broad, capable and
honest administration of the work authorized
by the statute if effect is to be given to that
part of the plan that relieves the country at
large from ultimate liability.
The pledge of the platform to secure our
citizens without distinction of race or creed,
whether native born or naturalized, at home
and abroad, the equal protection of the lawa
and the enjoyment of all the rights and priv
ileges open to them under the covenants of
our treaties, as their Just due. should be made
good to them. In the accomplishment of that
result It is essential that a passport Issued
by the Government of the United States to an
American citizen shall . be accepted the world
over as proof of citizenship.
The statute relating to the civil service Is
the outcome of the efforts of thoughtful, un
selfish and public-spirited citizens. Operation
under it has frequently been of euch a char
acter as to offend against the spirit of the
statute, but the results achieved, under a
partial enforcement of the law, have been
such as to both deserve and command tne
utterance of the Democratic party that it
stands committed to the principle of civil serv
ice reform and demands its just and Impartial
enforcement.
AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP.
I pointed out In my earlier response the
remedy which, in my judgment, can effectually
be applied against monopolies, and the assur
ance was then given that If existing laws, in
cluding both statute and common law, proved
adequate, contrary to my expectations, I favor
Euch further legislation within constitutional
limitations as will best promote and safeguard
the interests of all people.
Whether there is any common law which
can be applied and enforced by the Federal
courts cannot be determined by the President
or by a candidate for the Presidency.
The determination cf the -question was left
by the people in framing the legislation to the
judiciary and not to the executive. The Su
preme Court of the United States has recently
considered this question, and in the case of
the Western Union Telegraph Company vs.
the Call Publishing Company, to be found in
the one hundred and eighty- first volume of the
United States Supreme Court reports, page 02,
it decided that common law principles could
be applied by the United States courts in cases
involving interstate commerce in the absence
of United States statutes specifically covering
the case. Such Is the law of the land.
In some quarters it has been assumed that
in the discussion of the Philippine question in
my response the phrase "self government" was
intended to mean something less than Inde
pendence. It was not intended that it should
be understood to mean, nor do I think, as used,
it does mean less than independence.
However, to eliminate all '\u25a0 possibility for
conjecture, I now state that I am in hearty
accord with that plank of our platform that
favors doing for the Filipinos what we have
already done for the Cubans; and I. favor
making the promise to them now that we
shall take such action as soon as they are
reasonably prepared for it. If independ
ence, such as the Cubans enjoy, cannot be
prudently granted to the Filipinos at' this
time the promise that it shall come the mo
ment they are capable of receiving It will
tend to stimulate rather than hinder their
development. And this should be done not
only In Justice to the Filipinos, but to pre
serve our own rights; for a free people can
not withhold freedom from another people
and themselves remain free. The toleration
of tyranny over others will soon breed con
tempt for freedom and seli-government and
weaken our power of resistance to Insidious
usurpation of our constitutional rights.
The persistent refusal of the Republican ma
jority in the Federal Senate to ratify the reci
procity treaties negotiated in pursuance with
the advocated policy of Mr. Blaine and Mr.
McKinley and expressly sanctioned in the
fourth eectlon of the Dlngley act is a discour
aging exhibition of ' bad faith. As already
mentioned by me, the exorbitant duty im
posed on many an imported article by this
section of the Dlngley act was avowedly in
tended by Its author not to be permanent, but
to serve temporarily as a maximum from
which the Federal Government was em
powered to offer a reduction in return for an
equivalent concession on the part of. a foreign
country. President McKinley undertook hon
estly to carry out the purpose of the act. A
number of reciprocity agreements were nego
tiated within the prescribed limitation of two
years, which, if ratified would have the two
fold result of cheapening many imported prod
ucts for American consumption and opening
foreign markets. Not one of these agreements
has met with the approval of the Republican
masters of the Senate. Indeed, they did not
even permit their consideration. In view of
the attitude of the present executive, no new
agreement under the general treaty power need
be expected from him. Nor does the Republi
can platform contain a favorable reference to
one of the suspended treaties. This section
of the Dingley act stands forth as a monument
of legislative cozenage and political bad faith.
TRUST REMEDIES.
The period of excluslveness Is past. The ex
pansion of our trade and commerce is the
pressing problem. Commercial wars are un
profitable. A policy of good will and friendly
relations will prevent reprisals. Reciprocity
treaties aro in harmony with the spirit of the
times; measures of retaliation are not.
This argument was made In the Interest of
our manufacturers, whose products, he urged,
"have so multiplied that the problem of more
markets requires our urgent and immediate
attention." He had come to realize that the
so-called "stand pat" fiollcy must give way â
that there must be a reduction of duties to
enable our manufacturers to cultivate foreign
markets. The last words cf this Presidentâ
who had won the affection of his countrymen â
ought to be studied by every man who has any
doubt of the necessity, of a reduction in tariff
rates- in the interest of the manufacturer.
They present with clearness a situation and a
proposed remedy that prompted the provision
in our platform which declares that "We fa
vor liberal trade relations with Canada and
peoples of.oth^r countries where they can be
entered Into with benefit to American agricul
ture., mining or commerce."
Our martyred President William McKinley,
appreciated this situation. He pointed out in
his last address to the people that we must
make sensible trade arrangements if "we shall
extend .the outlets for our increasing surplus."
He said a system which provides a mutual
exchange of commodities Is manifestly essen
tial to tho continued healthful growth of our
export trade. â¢ â¢ â¢
I paid that tariff reform Is "demanded by the
best interests of both manufacturer and con
bunier." With equal truth it can be said that
the benefits of reciprocal trade treaties would
enure to both. That the consumer would be
helped is unquestionable. That the manufac
turer would receive great benefit by extending
his markets abroad hardly needs demonstra
tion. His productive capacity has outgrown
the home market. The very term "home mar
ket" has changed in its significance. Once,
from the manufacturer's point of view. It
meant expansion; to-day the marvelous growth
of our manufacturing industries has far ex
ceeded the consumptive capacity of our domes
tic markets, and the term "home market" Im
plies contraction rather than expansion. If we
would run our mills to their full capacity, thus
giving steady employment to our workmen
and securing to them and to the manufacturer
the profits accruing from Increased produc
tion, other markets must be found. Further
more, when our manufacturers are dependent
on raw materials In whole or in part imported
it is vital to the extension of their markets
abroad that they secure their materials on the
most favorable terms.
This astounding Increase is out of all pro
portion with the increase of our .population,
and finds no excuse from whatever aspect
we view the situation. The National . Demo-'
cratlc platform declares . - "that large reduc
tions can easily be made In the annual ' ex
penditures of the Government without impair
ing the efficiency of any branch of the public
service." Can there be any doubt of the ac
curacy of this statement? Between the ex
penditures of the year 1886, amounting to
$242,000,650 and those of the last fiscal year â
the seventh after Grover Cleveland ceased ; to
be Presidentâ aggregating $582,000,000. there la
a difference, so great as to excite- alarm In the
breasts of thoughtful men. Even â¢ excluding
the sum of $00,000,000 paid for tha Panama
The foreign relations of the Government
have In late years assumed special impor
tance. Prior to the acquisition of the Philip
pines we were practically Invulnerable against
attacks by foreign states. These tropical pos
eesslons, however, 7000 miles from our shores,
have changed all this and have in effect put
us under bonds to keep the peace. The new
conditions call for a management of foreign
affairs the more circumspect In that the re
cent American Invasion of foreign markets in
all parts of the world has excited the se*i-
OU3 apprehension . of all the great Industrial
peoples. It is essential, therefore, more than
ever to adhere etrlctly to the traditional
policy of the country as formulated by the
first President and never, In my judgment,
wisely departed from â to invite friendly re
lations with â¢ all nations while avoiding en
tangling alliances with any. Such a policy
means the cultivation of peace instead of the
gratification | of war and the minding of our
own business In lieu of spectacular Inter
mingling with the affairs of other nations. It
means strict observance of the principles of In
ternational law and condemns the doctrine
that a great state, by reason of Us strength,
may rightfully appropriate the sovereignty of
territory of a smaller state on account of its
weakness. It means for other American States
that it claims no rights and will assume no
functions save those of a friend and of an ally
and defender as against European aggressions.
It means that we repudiate the role of the
American continental policeman; that we re
fuse to act as debt collector for foreign state*
or their citizens; that we respect the Independ
ence and sovereignty of each American state
and its right to preserve order and otherwise
regulate Its own internal affairs in Its own
way; and that any Intervention In its affairs
by us is limited to the single office of enabling
Its people to work out their own political and
national destiny for themselves free from the
coercion of any European state.
Twenty-eight years have passed since the
Democratic party of the State of New York,
in convention assembled, recommended to the
National Democracy the nomination of Sam
uel J. Tilden as its candidate for the Presi
dency and declared Jt to be "their settled con
viction that a return to the constitutional
principles, frugal expenses and adminfttratlve
purity of the founders of the republic is the
first and most Imperious duty of the times â
the commanding issue now before the people
of the - Union." ' This strong expression ; was
called forth by the national expenditures for
the year 1875 which amounted to $274,000,000
â a situation 'which. In the opinion of a ma
jority " of . our people, justified an imperative
demand- for reform in tho administration of
public affairs. ' As the expenditures , of the
last fiscal year amounted to tho enormous
total of $582,000,000. it' is evident that a
thorough investigation of \u25a0 the public service
and the Immediate abandonment of useless
and extravagant expenditure are more nec
essary now than they were then.

ffiJIE nATTIVE OF "ALLOTS.
The old Inquiry "what are you going to do
about It?" la not stated in a new form. It
is said by the administration, in reply to
the public criticism of this order, that "It is
easy to test our opponents' sincerity In this
matter. Th-s order In question is revocable
at the pleasure of the executive. If our op
ponents come Into power they can revoke
this order and announce that they will treat
the veterans of 62 and 70 as presumably in
full bodily vieor and not entitled to pensions.
Will they authoritatively state that they in
tend to do so? If so we accept the issue."
This specified requirement of lncapacitv is in
effect *?t aside by order No. 78, as to all per
sons over CO. The war closed nearly forty years
ago. Iu the meantime many of our sailors and
soldiers long survived the age of 02 and passed
away without rect-ivlng any psnsion. Skillful
pension attorneys hunting through the statutes
failed to find there a provision giving a pension
to all who !iad reached C2. Many prominent
veterans urged the justice or Congressional
action giving a service pension to all veterans.
Bills to that effect were Introduced in Congress,
and not until March oÂ£ this year did any one
ever claim to have made the discovery that the
President had 'unver to treat the statute as if
It read that when a claimant had passed the
age of 62 years he is necessarily disabled and
only Kalf able to r-frform manual labor, and
therefore entitled to a pension.
The president of the Civil Service Commis
sion, General John C. Black, formerly Com
missioner of Pensions and commander in chief
of the Grand Army of the Republic, indicated
his view of the order when, in a recent address,
ho thanked the President for what h-e had done
and advised Ills hearers to use their influence
that a law might be passed to the same effect.
Full confidence, after all, seems not to have
been placed on the defense of justification, for
It is pleaded in mitigation that a former Demo
cratic President did something looking In that
direction. Even if that were so â which is not
admittedâour present duty would be none the
lf?s olain and Imperative.' Our people mUEt
never tolerate the citation of one act of usurpa
tion of jower r.s *an excuse for another. The
first may possibly be due to a mistake; the sec
ond, beins based on the first. It cannot be.
In explanation, however, it should be said
thRt the order relied on simply provides that
th*> age of seventy-five years should be re
garded as evidence of inability to perform
iranu.il labor. Few men are able to perform
manuil labor at that age, but nearly all
men are at sixty-two. The first order is based
on a fact that experience teaches, the other is
based on the assertion of that which is not
true as a general rule.
The National Democracy favors liberal pen
sions to the surviving soldiers and sailors and
their dependents on ' the ground that they de
eerve liberal treatment. It pledges by its plat
form adequate legislation to that end. But It
denies the right of the elecutive. to usurp the
power of Congress to legislate on that subject.
Such usurpation was attempted by pension
order No. 78 and effect has been given to it by
a Congress that dared not regent the usur
pation. It is said that "this order was made
In the performance i of a duty Imposed upon
the President by act of Congress," but the
provision making the imposition is not pointed
out. The act to which the order refers, which
Is the one relating to pensions to civil war
veterans, does not authorize pensions on the
ground of age. It does grant pensions to those
"suffering from any mental or physical dis
ability or disabilities of a permanent char
acter, not the result of their own vicious hab
its, which so incapacitates them from the per
formance of manual labor as to render them
unable to earn a support."
"We are justly proud of the officers and men
of our army and navy. Both, however, have
suffered from the persistent Injection of per
sonal and political Influence. Promotions and
appointments have frequently been based on
favoritism Instead of merit. Trials and court
martials have been Â«set aside under circum
stances indicating political interference. These
and other abuses should be corrected.
ARMY AND XAVY.
Our commerce in American bottoms amounts
to but 9 per cent of our total imports and ex
ports. For forty years prior to 1861. when the
Republican party came Into power, our mer
chant marine carried an average of 80 per
cent of our foreign commerce. By 1877 It had
dwindled to 27 per cent. Now we carry but a
small fraction of our exports and imports.
American shipping in the foreign trade was
greater by almost 100,000 tons in 1810 â nearly
a hundred years ago â than it was last year.
In the face of the continuous decline In the
record of American shipping during the last
forty-three years, the promises of the Repub
lican party to restore it are without encourage
ment. The record of the Democratic party
gives assurance that the task can be more
wisely intrusted to it. â¢
It is an arduous task to undo the' effect of
forty years of decadence and requires the study
and investigation of those best fitted by expe
rience to find the remedy â which surely does
not He in the granting of subsidies wrung
from the pockets of all the taxpayers.
Recent disclosures, coupled with the rapid
augmentation of Government expenditures,
show a need of an investigation of every de
partment of the Government. The Demo
crats in Congress demanded It. The Repub
lican majority refused the demand. The people
can determine by their vote In November
whether they wish an honest and thorough in
vestigation. A Democratic Congress and ex
ecutive will assure it.
should ever remember that the Idea of doing
a wrong to r smaller, weaker nation than we,
that even all mankind may have a resultant
good, is repugnant to the principles upon
which our government was founded. Under the
laws of the United States the authority is 1m
l>osed upon the executive to proceed with due
diligence to the construction if the canal. That
duty should be promptly performed.

New York Democrats are confident

Parker is a believer in a short cam

canvass. For that reason he deferred
bis letter of acceptance seven weeks
later than the letter of Samuel J. Til
den, whose fight was made on like is
sues. Governor Tllden-s letter Was
printed on August 5, 1876.
NEW YORK. Sept. 26.â The Herald
says: Surveying the political field in
the last week in September, these
things stand out with clearness:
New York State is doubtful and the
situation is complicated. Influenced by
its first poll, the Republican State Com
mittee claims this State by ; 30,000 for
Roosevelt and -Fairbanks, but this poll
was conducted before the State nom
inations were made and must be re
vised. It is conceded by Republicans
as well as by Democrats that if the
election were held to-day the Demo
cratic State ticket would be elected by
a large plurality.
, As New York is the hub around
which the entire Democratic campaign
revolves, it is necessary to examine the
situation elsewhere with particular ref
erence to the events that have taken
place here.
Dispatches to the Herald from all of
the doubtful States agreed that the
Saratoga convention, which nominated
Judge Herrick, had encouraged Demo
crats in the doubtful States with the
exception of Rhode Island.
Careful inquiry among campaign
managers, however, shows that the
drift has been toward Roosevelt for
more than a month and unless the
Democrats succeed in turning it toward
Parker the betting will continue, until
the end of the campaign with_2he adds
in favor of Roosevelt. Â». v /

The Board of Trade of Fruitvale has
ordered 3500 maps of the district
printed for circulation among 1 home
seekers and real estate men. Of these
maps 2500 will be of a convenient size
for the pocket and 1000 will be large

IRVINGTOX, Sept. 25. â The gym
nasium, the last of the new buildings
ar Anderson's Academy, is now fin
ished. The addition of this structure
makes the equipment of the academy
complete. The building is a large one
story frame structure, well lighted and
ventilated, provided with large locker
rooms and shower and plunge baths
and fitted with modern apparatus. It

There has been a lull in the Oak
land real estate market during the
week, as nearly all of the real estate
dealers have been . devoting 1 their
energies to working for the success .of
the improvement bonds. There has
been a steady demand for houses for
rent, however, and agents find it al
most impossible to accommodate tht#
steadily increasing numbers seeking
homes in this city. Cottages and flats
are in greatest demand among rent
ers, but there are also many Inquiries
for houses of from eight to twelve
rcoms.
An extensive manufacturing indus
try, which will give employment to
many workmen, is to be established in
Oakland within the next sixty days,
the company having been already or
ganized, with a capital stock of
560,000. Curtis" Wright Jr. of Car
thage, Mo., is the promoter of the new
enterprise and the other members of
the company are all prominent busi
ness men. The company, through Mr.
Wright, has obtained the Pacific Coast
agency for the manufacture of an im
proved steel bed spring and the neces
sary machinery for the plant has al
ready been ordered from the East.
Mr. Wright has an option on a suit
able building for a factory on the
water front in the business section of
Oakland. The new factory will at
first give employment to between fifty
and one hundred men, but as soon as
operations are well under way the
working force will be. increased per
manently to nearly 200.
More street and sewer work lias
been done in Oakland during the past
summer than has ever before been ac
complished In the same time. Charles
F. Ott, Superintendent of Streets, will
this month issue 25,000 individual
assessments, covering an expenditure
oi! $250,000. All these assessments are
for improvements to streets and
sewers. The .property assessed for
these improvements Includes more
than 100,000,000 square feet.
Secretary Edwin Stearns of the Oak

To-morrow the final blows will be
struck by the campaign committee in
the effort to arouse the voters to that
pitch of enthusiasm which inspires men
to not only vote themselves, but be
come proselyting missionaries.
Three noonday meetings are to be
held at the West Oakland railroad
yards to-morrow, one at 12:15 o'clock
and two at 12:30.
"It's a pleasure to talk to the railroad
men," said Secretary Stearns of the
Board of Trade to-day.. "They ask
questions intelligently, showing that
they have followed the arguments, pro
and con, in this matter. I think the
bonds will get a big majority in West
Oakland, because the project seems to
be thoroughly understood there."
All the bond workers will concentrate
their efforts to-morrow night in a pa
rade and mass-meeting on the high
school steps. C. J. Heeseman, marshal
af the parade, has secured the services
of four bands, which give their talents
to the ' affair free of charge. Citizens
representing all the improvement clubs
and the commercial organizations will
march from the City Hall to the Elev-
attractive appearance.
"All we ask," said John T. Bell, chalr
ma|of the press committee of the Pro
grSI Federation, "is that in the next
twenty-four hours every citizen who
can will inspect the Central Park tract,
see for himself what it is and then vote
as his judgment directs."
Parks and boulevards are essential factors
in every modern city. They are worth all they
cost In enhancing the beauty, lvealthfulness and
comfort of the community. Well paved streets
are valuable assets to-day in every city that
would attract additional inhabitants. Dayton.
Ohio, was started on an era of prosperity and
progress by a general movement to pave the
streets, nnd It row merits th<J name of "Thfl
Gem City." Kvery time I return to my former
home I am Impressed with its cleanliness anil
air of refinement. No one there would willingly
return to the former condition of muddy streets
and unkept yards nnd alleys.
It pays to improve the sanitary service of a
city. Given a beautiful site., with good sewers
nnd clean streets, larje public parks, commo
dious school bulldlncs constructed according to
the approved experience cf other cities and
you have a j place where people will delight
to dwell. Civic pride will be generated. Homes
will be biil'dfd wherein good citizens will ba
trained for the public weal. Churches will bs
maintained and the moral tone of the entire
community will be raised higher. As a citizen
Â«<s well as e clergyman I would rejolcs to see
Oakland take this step forward. .
Thousands visited the Central Park
tract to-day, free tickets having been
issued in large quantities by the Pro
gress Federation for this purpose. In
tense interest in the various features
of the tract has been roused by the
controversy concerning its merits as a
site for the largest park of Oakland,
and In the park could be seen to-day
groups of citizens discussing earnestly
the points involved in the controversy.
The rains have freshened the vegeta
tion of the tract, and it presented an
Oakland should be a model city. Nature has
mad? it easily possible to bring about this
result physically. Money and honesty com
bined with taste and ability are all that we
require. If the citizens are assured of the
honesty and ability of the officers in charge
of public affairs they will .doubtless vote In
favor of bonds. The present city government
enJOya the confidence of the community. This
seems a peculiarly favorable time to begin to
mnke Oakland a model city.
The Rev. Ernest E. Baker, pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church, gave
his views, strongly favorable to the
bonds, in a discourse on "The 'Model
City." Dr. Baker said:
Voting for the bonds does not commit us to
any given estimate of values; it simply in
structs the representatives of the city as to
the procedure they may lawfully take. For
one. I am absolutely certain that our present
officials are worthy of complete confidence and
that they will Jealously guard the interests of
the city. The issuance of the bonds will be
the longest step forward we have ever taken
and will be the beginning of an era of progress
that will not end until Oakland shall have
taken her place as one of the easily recognized
leading cities of the entire Union.
That there should be some honest difference
of opinion as to details ia not surprising when
such large plans are under consideration. Per
haps it Is charitable for us to recall that
many good people are deficient in constructive
Imagination and that they are more skillful
in negative criticism than in positive leader
ship. It is certainly remarkable that the citi
zens to whom we look for "light and leading"
upon large questions are nearly unanimous in
heartily supporting the proposed plan of Im
provement.
For some time a spirit of progress has been
at work among us. This spirit has found its
culminating expresson In the proposed bond
issue. The scheme of Improvements thus con
templated is wise and comprehensive, thor
oughly in harmony, with the highest civic
Ideals now prevalent among the leading think
ers of the world, admirably adapted to the
present needs of our city and finely calculated
to enhance our reputation and elevate our total
character as a progressive municipality. In
adding to the beauty of the city this scheme
reaches the highest point of civic wisdom and
idealism and it is not surprizing that it should
excite dissent from those Investments that
yield an immediate cash dividend.
In providing - for a first-class polytechnic
high school it meets one of the most urgent
needs of a modern city. The number of small
parks and playgrounds Is a provision that is
at the same time humane, artistic and educa
tional. If the citizens of Oakland could have
gone with me this summer through the over
crowded, sweltering sections of some our great
cities not a single dissenting vote would be
cast against these propositions. The whole
plan naturally culminates in the Central Park,
which is admirably located for the needs of
Oakland at the present time and the immediate
future. â¢
Dr. Vocburgh said in this connection:
From two pf the principal pulpits of
Oakland discourses were delivered to
day urging, as a means of civic im
provement, the support by the citizens
of .Oakland of the proposed bond issue.
At the Firat Baptist Church the pas
tor, the Rev. H. J. Vosburgh, raised
his voice in eloquent appeal. This
clergyman had returned recently from
an extended tour of the East. He il
lustrated his remarks with experiences
of his trip, citing what had been ac
complished elsewhere to further the
progress of communities.
Dr. Vosburgh is enthusiastic in his
eulogy of Oakland as a city for home
folk, in comparison with cities in the
East visited by him. He devoted his
address this evening- to a discussion or
"The Science of Voting," dealing at
length with the power and privileges
enjoyed by the American voter and the
responsibilities that are coincident with
the suffrage he enjoys.
Political duties were described by the
minister as calling for great wisdom
and discretion in their discharge. From
a consideration of the important polit
ical issues to be decided at the coming
State and national elections, Dr. Vos
burgh diverged to a plea to voters â to
all â to rally enthusiastically and with
one accord in support of the project to
beautify and improve Oakland by vot
ing 'bonds and thus securing money
with which to make of the city a place
to be proud, a city of which none need
be ashamed.

is training the girls and boys under
her supervision in the fifteen schools
of Berkeley to sing a select number of
songs during this term. This will be

will witness a song festival. Mrs.
Sweeey says that in many Eastern

school children. It is designed to make
it a popular affair, as a tribute to the
parents who help support the schools.
Therefore it will be opt.ii to the public

The Greek theater at the University
of California is such an admirable
place for so large an entertainment
that its use will be sought from the
university. There is no thought of giv

to prepare. The programme will in
clude folk songs, nursery songs, sailors'

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway. Sept. 26.
According to a writ of mandate is
sued by the Supreme Court yesterday,
Judge Hepry Melvin must either sign
a final decree of divorce in the case
of P. Claudius vs."' Gesine Claudius or
show how he came to sign a nunc pro
tune interlocutory decree of divorce in
the case a week ago. The case is one
where he granted a final decree a year
ago, which decree was afterward held
by the Supreme Court to be invalid
under the statute.
On petition of Attorney Asa V. Men
denhal! a few. days ago Judge Melvin
treated the final decree he had signed
as an interlocutory decree and granted
a nunc pro tune decree in its stead.
This application was made by Men
denhall to save his client a year's wait
and as soon as he had the Judge's sie
nature to his decree, dated back a year,
he presented him with a final decree to
sign, the record showing the divorce
was granted a year ago.
When it came to taking the final
step Judge 'Melvin demurred and said
the nunc pro tune order only began to
operate when filed with the County
Clerk and that the order in reality had
no effect. Mendenhall immediately
went up to the Supreme Court and yes
terday the Supreme Justices took the
view that he ought to sign the final de
cree and issued the writ prayed for.

ciation of French Youths, whose presN
dent delivered an address protesting
against attacks on Catholicism and its
head. The Pope replied in a long
speech, which, however, contained no
allusion to the conflict between the
French Government and the Vatican
except, perhaps, when he said the pro
test of the president of the Catholic
Association was truly consoling 1 , as it
assured the Pontiff that, amidst pres
ent difficulties, the Pope would have
these young sons of France on his side
in the struggle.

ENGAGEMENTS.
NORTH YAKIMA, Wash., Sept. 25.
D. W. Steel, a freight brakeman on
the Northern Pacific Railroad, was
roasted to death in a collision at Yak
ima City late last night.
A disabled engine in charge of En
gineer Clarence Shanno was follow
ing a local freight. The freight
slowed down at Yakima and the sec
ond engine crashed into its rear, tele
scoping the caboose and two boxcars.
Steel, who was upon the back plat
form, was pinned down and when the
wreckage caught fire was slowly
burned to death. The trunk of his
body was found upon the pilot. He
leaves a. wife and a family.
The two boxcars, which were filled
with wheat, were totally destroyed.
Engineer Shanno says the air
brakes of the disabled engine failed
to work properly. .

LONDON, Sept. 25.â The report of the
committee on organization of the Irish
Reform Association, which was adopt
ed at a meeting presided over by Lord
Dunraven at Dublin on Friday, was is
sued to-night. The report outlines an
important scheme for the evolution of
Irish government in finance and local
business.
It suggests the creation of an Irish
financial council, composed of twenty
four members, under the presidency of
the Lord Lieutenant and with the Chief
Secretary for Ireland as vice-president,
twelve members to be elected by
groups of existing Parliamentary con
stituencies and twelve to be nominated
by the crown, one-third of the mem
bers to retire every three years.
The functions of the council will be
to adminster the $30,000,000- expended
annually on Irish service, Parliament,
however, retaining a controlling power,
enabling the House of Commons to re
verse the council's decisions.
The report further suggests that a
statutory body should be created, con
sisting of Irish representative peers and
Irfsh members of the House of Com
mons, in addition to the proposed Fi
nancial Council, and to which should
be relegated all private bill legislation
affecting Ireland and any other Irish
business that might be referred to it
by Parliament.
On October 6 and 7, legions of suf
fragists will assemble in Los Angeles
to take part in the annual convention
of the State Suffrage Association.
From the looks of things now, the
suffragists will overrun the southern
burg, where a warm welcome awaits
them. The work at hand this year
is to present to the thirty-sixth ses
sion of the California Legislature a
monster petition, praying that an
amendment to the constitution, grant
ing equal political rights to women,
be submitted at the following election.
Apropos of the suffrage question,
the story is going the rounds, in
which Susan B. Anthony, the high
priestess of the "equal-rights" sup
porters, Is the heroine. During the
international convention in Berlin, the
Empress of Germany attended a ses
sion of the council, during which she
addressed each leader in her own
tongue. When it came the white
haired American's turn to talk she
bowed low, and said: "Madame, bur
President, Theodore Roosevelt, in
dorses woman's suffrage. Go and tell
your husband this, as he admires our
great leader."
Being a meek and respectful wife,
it is hardly probable that the Empress
did as requestedâ as she appeared
stunned with the awful information.
But the announcement bore good
fruit- Before the convention ad
journed, many a German household
The California branch Is doing ac
tive service in looking Into matters
that directly concern women's affairs
â not only In colleges, but abroad.
In the discussion that followed the
election, Mrs. Shuey recommended
that a committee be appointed to in
vestigate the instruction in hygiene at
Stanford and Berkeley, also proposing
that an assistant-professorship in hy
giene be established at Berkeley Uni
versity, this chair to be filled by a
woman, who should supervise the
needs of the women students. This
suggestion met with almost unani
mous approval. The national conven
tion of the Alumnae meets in St. Louis
In November. To this Miss May L.
Cheney has been appointed delegate
from the California branch.
The California Branch of the Na
tional Association of Collegiate Alum

. To-day the Pacific Coast Women's
Press Association is to hold a delight
ful session in Century Hall. The meet
ing promises to be the largest of the
new club year. The attraction? Henry
F. Williams, the pioneer who knows
the earlv history of San Francisco as
the rest of us know our prayers. And
such matter grows in value day by
day, since the time is not far distant
when such Hales can be gleaned only
from the printed page. Then let us
hear the inspired word while yet we
mayâ and from the lips of the men who
helped make the history of our city.
Besides Mr. Williams' talk, Miss
Elizabeth Jacciues will present some
vocal numbers and a few selections
will be read from the Souvenir Maga
zine, the portfolio of work done by the
clever members of the club. Meeting
at 3 p. m. And let not the rain with
hold able-bodied members from enjoy
ing a rare treat. Why should Itâ with
rubbers and cars?
The programme was a treat, inas
much as Korea is a tea table topic
these warring days.
And speaking ofi tea, the Forum Club
holds a reputation for good tea, Why
can't other clubs â now, discretion for
bids me to particularizeâ hunt up the
same formula?
It is only after the Korean wife at
tains to motherhood that she is vested
with any shred of dignity or impor
tance. Poor Korean .women! If they
only had a club or two out there they
would make things lively for those
stupid old pipe-smokers, whose chief
characteristic is that they are good
runnersâ and mighty bad soldiersâ an
attribute of all men who degrade their
womenfolk!
Miss Louise Elliot told of a few so
cial and political changes that had been
effected by the invasion of Americans.
But these reforms have had but little
influence, for the native Is so indiffer
ent to everything except his idea of
crude peace that neither advancement
nor stagnation impresses him, if he is
personally undisturbed. Mrs. Wemple
was in possession of a Korean news
paper, the Korea Daily News, pub
lished in Seoul, from wnich she read
an editorial upon the placidity of the
native temperament, showing its com
plete indifference as to whether Japan
or Russia gained territory if only the
Korean habits, fostered for generations,
be undisturbed. Some Korean articles
of dress and pottery were exhibited,
the property of Mrs. Hunt, who has
lived long in this peaceful seat of war.
Child life in Korea Is said to be beau
tiful, except for those who exhibited
the bad taste to be born women. Until
the age of seven all miniature Koreans
have a merry time, but after a girl
reaches that age she loses her impor
tance and her individuallity, and be
comes known forthwith as Mr. 's
daughter, or Mr. 's wife, all ot
which made the Forum Club women
mighty thankful they weren't^ born
Koreans.
Mrs. Frank Britton presented a pa
per on the general geographical fea
tures of Korea, touching upon the pol
itics of the countryâ such as it isâ and
its weird monetary standards. This
prepared the way for Mrs. S. Marcus,
who told of the home life of Korea,
showing many of the traditions and
customs to be similar to those of other
Oriental nations, differing only in de
tail.
With a zest that augurs well for its
future the Forum Club has swung into
its work â cultural, of course â under
the guidance of Mrs. Fredericks, and
many delightful days are on the cards
for the members and their friends.
Those monthly luncheons now under
discussion sound good. May they ma
terialize, for by these things the de
cadent art of conversation may be re
vivified.
Last Wednesday was current topic
day in the Forum Club. Under, the
clever leadership of Mrs. Wemple Ko
rea was discussed, and many points
hitherto unknown to the ordinary
reader were presented. In view of the
present war conditions the matter
dealt with served to quicken interest
in the strange country that is slowly
awakening to the activities of a new
civilization.

MRS. JOHN JACOB ASTOR, THE BEST DRESSED WOMAN IN NEW YORK. ]
WHAT SHE PAYS OUT YEARLY FOR- HER CLOTHES WOULD PROVIDE
RAIMENT FOR ABOUT 50O YOUNG WORKING WOMEN.
A FOOL girl in Philadelphia has caused the death of the motor
man of a trolley car. He was in front of the car adjusting- the
lamp, while another stationary car was standing close ahead.
The girl won the applause of her fool companions by continually
Bounding the car gong, and finally moved the starting lever of the
electrical apparatus, causing the car to jump ahead and kill the
motorman by crushing him against the car ahead. She is a fool,
but a criminal fool, and should get the severest punishment the law
will permit.
But she has imitators. They belong to the class that aim guns
at people and kill them, and that satisfy their curiosity about the
lock mechanism of loaded firearms, killing people thereby, and feel
ing sorry afterward. The most dangerous fools, however, are those
who tamper with cars and the running of trains, for they may put
many lives in peril.
On the day of the Knights Templar parade the local railroad
on Seventh street, Oakland, was crowded with densely loaded trains
of passengers on the way to the ferry. The service was admirably
arranged for the convenience and safety of thousands of people.
When one of these trains was running, with others behind it, a boy,
not a young boy, but a fool just going out of his teens, which he
should never have lived to enter, was seen to pull the signal cord
by which the conductor communicates with the engineer. The en
gineer answered the signal with his whistle and stopped the train.
A prompt order to go ahead probably averted a shocking catas
trophe.
The fool should have been given over to the police and sent to
prison for a term of years. A catastrophe would have killed him,
but the fool's estimate of the value of his own life should not have'
protected him in risking the lives of a thousand people. We are
aware that corporations cannot always guard against these criminal
fools, but when one is caught he should be punished to the extent of
the law.
CRIMINAL FOOLS.
How much must a self-respecting
working woman spend on her clothes?
Miss Dora Wells, who holds a posi
tion as stenographer in a lawyer's of
fice, from which she denves an Income
of $12 50 a week, estimated recently
that $106 82, Judiciously expended, will
provide an ample wardrooe for a wom
an who earns her own living. She has
kept an account of her expenditures
for several years and sne says she
knows. /
A North Side woman, whose husband
has an income of $5000 a year, and who,
although she" pleads not guilty to the
charge of being a society woman, does
boast that her wardrobe is always in
condition to respond to any ordinary
demand made upon it. said that $610
a year would clothe her. When she
came to itemize the list, however, she
had to acknowledge that the Christmas
present of $50 which her husband in
variably gives her goes to make up the
deficit in her dressing allowance.
The difference between what Mrs.
Barstow considers necessary for the
society woman and Dora Wells' actu
al expenditures is $39,843 13. What
Mrs. John Jacob Astor pays out in one
year would clothe 470 working women
like Miss Wells. The woman who ex
pends $40,600 annually for her raiment
buys garments by the dozen and
everything Bhe . wears must be made
for her, and of special pattern and de
sign.
The way a working woman "shops"
for what she wears Is described .by
Miss Wells:
"Although a girl can dress fairly well
I 1 OW much must a society woman
LJ expend on her clothes?
I 1 Mrs. Safford Barstow oft New
' York, an authority on the sub
ject, has declared that $39,950 is the
requisite amount, says the Chicago
Tribune. Mrs. John Jacob Astor, she
says, is the best dressed person in New
York and her wardrobe costs $50,000
annually. In Mrs. Barstow's opinion
$23,000 is only a fair ayerage of what
society women spend.
a modiste and her hats are not built
to order, for what she buys is ready
made, and she doesn't get It, either,
until she wants to put it on.
"I don't know much about society
women, but I do know that the work
Ing girl, if she is young and pretty,
will spend more money on her clothes
than an unattractive spinster. That is
only natural, though, because, of
course, she is looking out for a chance
to get married, and there's no use talk
ing, men are attracted by a woman's
clothes.
"My estimate doesn't count a linen
suit my mother gave me, nor two pairs
of gloves that er â were given me," con
tinued Miss Wells. "But the cloak that
cost me J1S will last at least two sea
sons, and maybe three, so that makes
up the difference."
The North Side woman who spends
$50 a month and her Christmas gift
on her clothes was allowed to see the
working girl's schedule and she
promptly declared it "impossible."
Even when she was told that the fig
ures were made up from absolute ex
penditures she professed incredulity,
and said that "some one mtlst be giv
ing that girl clothes."
"It is not absolutely necessary for a
woman to spend as mucn money as I
do for clothes," she declared, "but no
woman can dress on less than $300 a
year unless she wears calico wrappers
nearly all the time. Why, JustTee
what I have to have, and cut that in
half and you will get what Is positive
ly necessary for every woman."
A CORRESPONDENT with an eye to the interests of Cali
fornia has forwarded us a suggestion for the development of
a new industry, which should commend itself to men of en
terprise. This communication calls attention to the fact that the
â¢ great beds of /clay in this State, known to have commercial value
from a porcelain maker's viewpoint, lie practically untouched, while
yearly we import from abroad chinaware to the value of a million
of dollars. Our correspondent urges it upon the notice of manu
facturers that sewer pipe and flower-pots should not continue to be
the only product of our deposits of kaolin, and predicts success for
the one who will first turn California's clays into something more
artistic and more valuable.
We believe this suggestion has the foundation of practicability.
The clays we have, as a survey of the State Mining Bureau reports
. will demonstrate. They are of a high class, many of them, and per
â¢ fectly fitted for the most delicate manipulations of the potter's wheel.
In a report made to the bureau some years ago the consulting chem
ist, W. D. Johnston, cited the high quality of potter's clays that are
to be found in Amador, Placer, Nevada and Butte counties, and in
corporated the results of tests upon eleven varieties of workable clays
elsewhere. According to his opinion the kaolin percentage in Butte
County and Amador clays is high enough to warrant the belief that
the most delicate porcelains could be wrought therefrom.
Already there is a concern of some note which has gone to some
extent into the production of art pottery, but not on a scale suffi
ciently broad to attract public attention to its wares ; fire bricks and
flower-pots continue to be the chief articles of its output. But should
there be a determined movement to enter upon a new venture look-
ing toward the utilization of resources offered for the upbuilding of
'the new industry of porcelain making, it would seem that every
"favorable condition was present to insure the success of the enter
prise. ;vi
CALIFORNIA PORCELAIN.
'-pHERE is now no longer any doubt that, taking the country as
a whole, business is decidedly better and that the improvement
1 in trade noted for several weeks is not stationary, but expand
ing. Almost every condition shows it. The bank clearings last
week were 20.6 per cent larger than during the corresponding week
last year, with the great majority of cities and towns in all sections
ranged on the right side of the exhibit The failures, instead of
being more numerous, as has been the rule for a long time, are now
fewer, those for the week being 225, against 232 last year. The rail
way earnings thus far in September are 5.7 per cent larger than at
the same time in 1903, and the exports from New York last week
were about $2,950,000 larger than last year, while the imports were
$715,000 less.
In addition to this excellent showing collections are reported
: better almost everywhere and the fall trade is undeniably expanding,
especially in the distribution of dry goods, clothing, groceries, foot
wear and hardware. Wool is ruling very firm, with a quick demand,
while the mills are reporting increasing activity. The different
manufacturing interests report less idle machinery than for some
time past. The labor situation is considerably improved, and though
there are still a few strikes on, several large and important ones
' have been settled.
The crop prospects, while not as brilliant as a few weeks ago,
are certainly no worse than on the first of the month, and, taking the
three or four leading crops in the aggregate, the harvest outlook is
excellent. This imparts marked buoyancy to many industries, stimu
lates the demand for merchandise, strengthens credits and manifests
"its influence in Wall street, where the general tone of the stock
â¢market is one of firmness, though the movement in stocks has been
light for some days past. Money continues in large supply all over
the country and interest rates accordingly remain low. No appre
hensions of financial stringency attending the moving of the crops
. are expressed, and in brief/ look in whatever direction we may, we
find on all sides a confidence in the future which almost assures
. another good year in trade.
A good feature is that New York, which for months had nothing
but gloomy reports of the commercial situation, is now sending out
the best reports, excepting, of course, the Pacific Coast, which has
not at any time felt any marked diminution in business. The nation's
metropolis now sends cheerful advices of a well-supplied and easy
money market, specifying dry goods, iron and steel, leather earn
ings and wool as particularly exhibiting improvement. Coffee and
cotton are unsettled, as usual at this time of the year, when the
condition of the crops is of marked importance, but both seem to be
resisting all bear attacks and maintaining their positions. There is
â¢ a lively milling demand for wheat all over the West, the movement
in flour has lately shown a pronounced expansion and the same
condition is reported in the steel export trade. Provisions alone con
tinue quiet, but even in this line a strong undertone is becoming
manifest, and the packers are now supporting the market, whereas
up to quite recently they were either bearing it or letting it alone.
All these signs are significant of a general improvement in busi
ness. Xo unusual activity is expected during the rest of the year,
.but the dullness which prevailed over the eastern section of the
country during the spring and early summer months is evidently
being succeeded by increasing animation and confidence. Consider
> ing that this is a Presidential year, when according to all precedents
trade should be dull, the signs of the times are certainly cheerful.

ANSWERS 10 QUERIES,
Fire will kill trie hemlock and white
fir quicker than it will the flr. ~" Con
sequently your next growth will likely
be flr, for that is all that will be left
to furnish seed. But If you want to
raise fir, remember that all else i3
weeds, and fir Is the best and quick
est growth we can get.
But when the ground is once burnt
clean and seeded to flr, then keep the
fire out, for until it is thirty or forty
years old It is very tender, the bark
is thin and there will be lots of small
trees crowded out which will die If
the stand is thick enough to make
good timber, and this will burn .hard
enough to kill what is left.

AUBURN. "Wash^ Sept. IT.
Editor The Call: I see In Sundays
Issue of The Call an article by a for
estry expert, signed E. A. Sterling and
an editorial on the question of forest
preservation-
Unfortunately I never have had a
course In scientific forestry, and have
never traveled in Europe, but have
for the last twenty-two years been In
the employ of two of the largest tim
ber owning: corporations In the North
west, namely the Northern Pacifio
Railway and the "Weyerhaluser Tim
ber Company and Its allied companies
and have to speak my piece as a
woodsman and an observer. Of Cali
fornia and the climatic condition pecu
liar to it I know nothlns.
In Western "Washington I have trav
eled a good deal In the last fourteen
years and have arrived at same con
clusions which of course may be mod
ified If I followed this work fourteen
years more.
First â The Indian was not a for
ester in the scientific sense of tha
word. He was Interested In exploit
ing the game, which was his means
of subsistence. To do this he did, and
does yet to a limited extent, use fire
to remove the forest growth, and let
the sun In to get the growth of fire
weed and hardwood brush the game
feeds on. One main growth of com
mercial timber in Western Washing
ton is flr. Next is cedar. Any ona
who has had a course In scientific
forestry can put In the scientific
names right here.
The history of fir Is this: It only
can grow right when the seed can get
to the mineral solL This Is true of
cedar to a sreat extent. When not
disturbed by fire the flr and cedar
grow and mature, each year dropping
their waste products, leaves and
cones, till they arrive at maturity and
die. By this time there Is from six
Inches to two feet of rotten wood on
the ground, with those trees which
died before reaching maturity. This
represents 500 or 600 years of
time. In the meantftne, there has
grown up, that will make timber.
In addition to the vine maple and
brush, a growth of hemlock and
white fir. So far, there is no young
growth of flr or cedar to speak of.
If there Is no fire yet, there will very
likely be a wind on the exposed
places. The result of this Is that
when the sun gets in there Is a thick
growth of hemlock and white flr
which are Inferior grades of timber
and must be classed as weeds by the
woodsman who is Interested chiefly in
exploiting the timber. From this on
you can look for no more flr or cedar,
but the hemlock and white flr will
reproduce Itself for another genera
tion, or perhaps two, till there Is from
two feet to four feet of rotten wood
on the ground or floor, which you
call duff. Then the process appears
to stop so far as timber Is concerned.
What growth comes up is scattering,
shortbodied and unfit for lumber, al
though the conditions are Ideal for
holding the rain as It falls.
Now comes "Lo the poor Indian
whose untutored mind" knows nothing
of forestry as taught In universities or
as practiced in Europe, and sets fire
to this mass of duft>or rotten wood.
If he gets a good burn and clears
this all off to the mineral soil, the
next growth will be flr and cedar if
there are enough living trees near by
to furnish seed. If not. If there is
still a layer of humus on the ground,
the next growth will be hemlock and
white flr. Good of their kind, but
not the best kind of timber the soil
can produce.
Second â There are two problems.
One is to conserve the moisture on
the hills. If this is the chief object
keep the fire out by all means. Let
the brush and debris from logging lie
as it falls, and decay, if you log any.
but better not log at all. if the only
object Is to keep the moisture back
as long as possible, for the more rot
ten wood or duff there is on the
ground the more water it will hold.
Also keep stock off. for sheep and
goats, and to a certain extent cattle,
will clear off the brush and pack th<?
soil. If the question is to preserve
the timber supply, and upon this de
pends the prosperity of most of West
ern Washington and Oregon, either
leave some of the flr and cedar while
logging for seed, or make arrange
ments for seeding anew, but burn the
logging works. Then reburn. und
keep it up till the last vestige of rot
ten wood or duff is gone and the
mineral soil Is exposed over the whole
tract.

Mr Miot has samples of everything grown
by Tulare County soil, and nothing appears In
the car In the way of resources that was not
sro wn in this county. It Is truly tho best
exhibit In the State of California, If the
opinions of travel lnsr men are to be taken as
a criterion, and they have an opportunity to
see all of the exhibits of the State. The ex
hibit represents the true condition of things
In the county and dots not exaggerate the
"rowth of any one thine. Every town and
vicinity In the county is represented and Mr.
Mlot will speak as good a word for one vi
cinity as he will for another.
Mr Miot will visit towns of a population
ranging from 500 to 10,000. At each one he
will put up a screen and will rive an Illus
trated lecture. He haa over one hundred views
of various ranches in the county, the methods
of handling fruit in its various stages of
mountain Bcenery and of the educational In
stitutions. These will be thrown upon a screen
by the use of a projecting lantern, and a short
talk given upon each. Mr. Mlot is an Inter
esting talker, and being convincing in his re
marks he is sure to attract attention from
thoÃo Eastern people who have Intentions of
coming west.. Mrs. Mlot will accompany her
husband, and having had much experience in
the same line at Los Angeles ahe will be of
wM h be' taken through the States of
lowa Kansas/Illinois and Missouri. Tho first
stop 'will be made at Newton. Kan., a town
that has already been billed ahead. Each
towV where a stop will be made will be ad
vertlsed in ahead of time. The lectures whl
be free. Manager Mlot will have himself sup
ri'led with several thousand of the pamphlets
Issued some time ago. and will distribute them
among the people interested In the exhibit.
There Is no doubt the exhibit and the unique
manner of getting it before the public's eye
of the East will brinÂ« unlimited suocess to th.
i county.
The Visalia Delta describes the
method that has been taken to ad
vertise Tulare County, giving much
space to the exhibit that will be pre
sented to the people of the Middle
West. The account is, in part, as fol
lows:
Probably the greatest advertising scheme
that Tulare County ever put forth left on the
Santa Fe this morning at 5 o"clock for a tour
of the East, to be Out of the county for at
least three and a half months and probably
more If the weather will permit.
This scheme la the actual showing of the
resources of this county aa they appear In a
preserved state. No better advertisement can
be put before the eyes of the Eastern home
neeker. As was mentioned some clays ago. the
car was secured from the Santa Fe Company,
a regular passenger coach, and eopeclally
equipped so as to make a display of the fruits.
Manaeer Mlot of the Tulare County exhibit
has been working laboriously for the past
few days Installing the exhibit as It will bÂ«
I seen by many thousands of Eastern eyes.
I Silver-plated brackets were shipped from San
\u25a0 Francisco and the many tall jars have been
fastened to the side of the car so as to pre
vent any damage while en route to the past
or upon their return. The exhibit was placed
1 in the car with the greatest, care, and when
I the work was completed it was truly interest
; Ing even to the residents of this county, where
t the products are grown and seen every day.
The car was brilliantly lighted and the glisten
ing of the glass Jars, together with the varied
colors of the fruit, made a beautiful sight to
look upon.

The American bark Reaper, which left New
castle, Australia, July 10, arrived here yester
day afternoon. In latitude 32 south and longi
tude 165 east she ran into a gale which lasted
fifteen days. High seas constantly went over
the vessel and much damage waa \lone about
the decks, everything movable being washed
overboard. A number of sails were lost and
the hull was strained almost to the leaking
point. Chariest Klein was dragged from the
wheel by a boarding wave and violently hurled
against the railing. Fortunately ' he was not
washed overboard, but his arm was broken and
he was otherwise much Injured. Carpenter
Paul Relges was washed out of his bunk un
der the topgallant forecastle and carried along
the deck, almost going over the Bide into the

By crder of the Treasury Department, the

harbor at all hours of the night without dis
playing lights, and the simplest rules and regu

of the Tulare County Board of Trade
deals are the sudden transformations
that attend agricultural conditions in
California. â¢ One picture shows how
wheat fields have been converted into
orange groves in five years. It is due
to the county to give some account of
those Industries with which it has been
less credited than the counties south
of Tehachapi. Concerning its raisins
and raisin growing it is said that some
of the largest raisin vineyards in the
world are in Tulare County, the indus
try of raisin making being especially
strong in the vicinity of Dinuba,* Orosi
and Sultana. Here a ton and a half per
acre is reported to be the average crop
of raisins. Sometimes the raisin crop
win go as high as two and a half tons.
All varieties of wine grapes thrive in
Tulare County, yielding from eight to
twelve tons an acre. The acreage of
table grapes is increasing. More than
twenty-five varieties of table grapes
grow to perfection.
RAISES CITRUS FRUITS.
Even to many in California the facts
related concerning the rise and exten
sion of the citrus fruit industry in Tu
lare County will be surprising. In the
last few years, it is asserted, the grow
ing of citrus fruits, especially the pro
duction of the navel orange, has out
stripped other industries. A little more
than a decade ago it was generally ac
cepted as a fact that the southern part
of the State was exclusively the orange
section, and that north of the Tehach
api Mountains oranges could not be
grown profitably.
The people of Tulare County, in
common with* others, held this belief
until about sixteen years ago, when
orange groves were planted by men
of independent thinking along the
western slope of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains. In Porterville, in the foot
hills, the first experiment was made.
All old theories were disproved. The
groves flourished and the fruit proved
to be of excellent quality. The fruit
ripened one month to six weeks ear
lier than the orange of Southern Cal
ifornia. As soon as it had been dem
onstrated that Tulare could produce
Washington navel oranges in time to
find the Eastern markets bare at
Thanksgiving and Christmas time the
orange industry in the county received
a great impetus. There are now more
than 7000 acres In orange and lemon
groves in Tulare.
"Tulare County," so it is said, "will
this year ship more than two-thirds
of the citrus fruits shipped from the
combined central and northern por
tions of California. The output will
be 1600 carloads. The first carload of
1903 was shipped Nove-nber 1."
The citrus section of Tulare County
lies along the foothills on the western
slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains
and includes Lindsay, Exeter. Naranjo,
Piano, South Tule, Worth and Lemon
Cove, and is paralleled by a branch of
the Southern Pacific railroad. The
boast of Tulare County in this connec
tion is that the black scale will not live
in the county; that smut on the fruit is
unknown, and that the fruit goes from
the tree 3 to the boxes in its natural
condition, without washing.
SCEXIC ATTRACTIONS.
A rare attraction Is claimed in that
the humblest dweller in Tulare County
can, during the summer months, load
his family and camp outfit into a
wagon and. "in from twenty-one to
forty-eight hours, be in a mountain
fairyland, there being good wagon
roads to an elevation of 7000 feet.

The city of Marysvllle gets a good
share of space. What is said about
that city is well worth repeating. In
part, the account is as follows:
The county sent of Tuba County, with a pop
ulation which exceeds &UOO, is beautifully situ
ated at the junction of the Yuba and Feather
rivers, on the line of the California and Ore
gon on the east, the San Francisco and Oro
ville on the west (Southern Paclno system),
fifty-two miles from Sacramento. the State
capital, and 142 mile* frota San Francisco,
the metropolis of the West.
The city ia well equipped with transporta
tion facilities, being: a terminal point, thus
enjoying the same freight rates on Eastern
shipments arriving at San Francisco. Sacra
mento and Los Angeles, and Is an important
shipping point and trading center for a vant
territory. Including the rich farming and min
ing itection by which It is surrounded, and Is
considered on* of the best business towns on
the coast.
Its streets are well paved with bitumen and
macadam, its sidewalks are of cement, and
are shaded on either side with beautiful orna
mental trees. The comfortable homes. In their
settings of magnificent orange and lemon trees,
pretty lawns and gardens laden with a profu
sion of flowers of myriad variety, add much
to the beauty of the city. Its banks (three in
number) have combined deposits of $2,000,000,
their aggregate capital, surplus and dividends
being $048,000. Its business houses, - public
buildings and its seven churches would do
credit to a larger city. Its splendid public
school system, extending to -every district. In
the county within easy reach of pupils, af
fords the best facilities for common-school ed
ucation, excellent teachers being employed at
rood salaries. Besides the Marysville High
School (which Is accredited to the State Uni
versity), additional educational advantages are
presented by- the* College of Notre Dame and a
business college. Two progressive and up-to
date newspapers supply to the reading public
the daily news.
Marysville Is Incorporated and has at Its
head an energetic young Mayor, who Is sup
ported by able officials. The city has recently
been bonded In the sum of $(55,000 with which
Its sewer system is to be amplified and , Its
water park, known as Ellis Lake. Improved
The Chamber of Commerce of
Marysville authorizes the pamphlet
that has just been published for the
purpose of advertising Yuba- County,
of which it is said in the opening: par
agraph that "it is half valley and half
mountainous, rich and fertile, com
prising 393,800 acres, or 96 5 square
miles, centrally located in the Sacra
mento Valley and lying between the
Honcut River on the north. Bear
River on the South, the Feather on the
west, with the Yuba River running its
full length through the county. The
county is surrounded by the counties
of Sutter, Butte, Plumas and Placer."
Situated in Yuba County is the old
est town in California. The county
boasts of the largest plant of the Bay
Counties Power Company and of the
mines that annually contribute great
values of gold and silver. It boasts
of opportunities for irrigation, of fine
climate, of its annual rainfall of 18 to
20 inches.
ABOUT MARYSVIIiLiE.
MAKES SHOW OP RESOURCES.
Yuba County Picturesquely Advances
, Claims for Recognition.
Five miles from Wheatland. In the Bear I
River, are located four gold dredges, two of !
which are In active operation. Tljls dredging
company has secured sufficient land to keep
these dredges at work for fifty years.
To the north of Browns Valley and In the
Immediate vicinity quartz mining Is carried on.
To the east of Brown 3 Valley and eighteen
miles from Marysvllle is the town of Smarts
ville. This district is also noted for Its fine !
fruits, both cltxus and deciduous, and more i
especially for its production of fine oranges, j
This district has the advantage over some [
others, owing to the fact that It is irrigated. ;
On the south side of the Yuba River In this i
locality are large placer mines, from which
millions In gold have been extracted and where
millions bttll remain. j
In the section lying to the south of Smarts- |
ville and extending to the Bear River, and
known ss the Cabbage Patch, are rich mineral
deposits of gold and copper, which have been
but slightly developed. However, to the east
a couple of mile* there Is one valuable copper
deposit from which much ore has been taken
and which Is equipped with extensive ma- ;
chinery for crushing ore and manufacturing
mineral paint. This section aleo produces fine '
coreals and fruits and land can be purchased
at a reasonable tlguro. \
In the Indiana Ranch district gold mining has
been carried on since the earliest days, It being
a rich mineral section. More than a dozen
quartz mines are In the course of development.
Still to the north are to be found the tim
ber lands which surround the towns of Chal
lenge and Woodville and which in the past fed
the 6awmlllÂ» located there with logs enough to
turn out 1,000,000 feet of lumber a year.
Strawberry Valley, situated at the extreme
northern point of the county, was In the early
days noted for Its rich gold, mines, and there
Is a tendency to restore the old-time activity.
Thirty-one miles northeast of Marysville, in
the midst of a district rich in fanning, mining
and fruit growing, is the town of Dobbins.
Four miles from these points, - over a little
level country, then down a steep hill to the
very banks of the north fork of the Tuba
River la Colgate, where the largest and most
extensive group of power houses owned by the
Bay Counties Power Company la located.
Some eight miles northeast of Dobbins Is lo
cated - Bullard'fl Bar and Oregon Hill, where
In the years past many forturnes have been
made by the miners who carried on surface
mining. But those days are past and quartz
ledges ara now being developed. To the east
a few miles many large hydraulic mines were
successfully operated,- and here came Into
existence the town of Camptonville, pictur
esquely situated on the edge of a bluff.
TIIE PICTUIIESQUE VIEW.
Unexpectedly you are ushered Into some
clearing, where over undulating hills are
growing orchards of beautiful fruit, rich red ,
apples bearing the limbs of the trees almost;
to the ground, peaches exquisite In coloring*
and luscious In flavor, and vineyards from i
which are picked black table grapes as large
an cherries, wine grapes from which the finest
wine Is produced, and last, but not least, by
the side of these, fruits are fields of . ripened
craln. It may be mentioned , that the black

GOLD AND FINE FRUIT.
Twelve miles south of Marysvllle, by grain
fields and stock farms, beautified by stately
oaks, one reaches the enterprising and pros
perous town of Whcatland. situated directly
on the line of the California and Oregon and
thirty miles from Sacramento, the State capi
tal. Wheatland Is well located on a ridge a
little higher than the surrounding country and
has 1000 inhabitants.
To the south, and tributary to Wheatland.
along the banks of the Bear River, stretching
from the low hills of the Sierra Nevada Moun
tains on the east to Dry Creek on the west,
are the wonderfully fertile lands of the Bear
River. Here are located the largest hop-yards
in the world. These yards afford employment
to many men, women and children during tnÂ«
hop-plcklng season.
These lands arÂ»- especially adapted to the
needs of tl".- nnui with a medium capital, who
wishes tr* build a home and make for himself
and family a comfortable living on a small
.farm. Land in this section can be purchased
for $12 oer acre for the red land, which is
suited to the culture of olives and citrus
fruits. The river land is held at about $14
per acre and is the best In the world for
grapes, Bartlett aears and alfalfa. An or
chard will bear the third year after setting
out. Alfalfa will yield on an average seven
tons to the acrf and will produce about five
crops, affording three months' pasture. Alfalfa
hay brings In the field $7 per ton. This seems
like a good location for a creamery colony,
as there is already built and well equipped in
Wheatland a creamery, which at the present
1b closed, owing to lack of milk.
OTHER COMMUNITIES.
The various -industries of Marysville
are described. Among them are flour
mills, fruit canneries and packing
plants and a foundry.
The future prospects for dredger mining on
the Yuba, east from Marysvllle some fourteen
miles, are excellent, much land having been
recently bonded.
and beautified. Marysvllle will, as far as
known, be the first city m Northern California
to makT the most of Its opportunities by add
ing parks, drives and pleasure resorts to ita
premises.
The city is well lighted by electricity, being
on the main line of the Bay Counties Power
Company of which the Marysvtlle Gas and
Electric Company Is the distributing agent.
In its history Marysvllle Is associated with
oome of the most striking Incidents of Cali
fornia life, some of the nation's most promi
nent men at ono time and another having re
sided here. Among those readily called to
mind are Hon. Stephen J. Field. Hon George
C. Gorham. Noah Brooks and John Q. Pack
ard, the mining millionaire of Utah, who will
in the near future erect a new library build
ing to cost $75,000, which will become the
home of the public library, now established
many years, the new building to be a gift
from this public-spirited citizen.
Marysvllle Is also well known for Its manu
facturing Interests. The reputation of the
product of its woolen mills, built in 186T,
is known from ocean to ocean, and the demand
for the superior quality of blankets, under
wear, dress goods, flannel, lap robes, steadier
shawls and other articles of manufacture far
exceeds the supply. In ISO!) the old plant was
destroyed by flre. but In 1001 \he mill was re
built on an enlarged basis and war equipped
with forty looms, which had a rated capacity
of. 480.000 yards of cloth a year. During tha
last year theee 'mills have "been extended by
adding ten wide looms of the latest pattern.

The important matter of the cost of
land and the other questions relating
to the acquisition of a farm In Tulare
County that an inquirer would natur
ally ask are fully covered. Good
lends, It is asserted, are to be had at
reasonable prices. Grazing- lands rang-e
from $4 to $15 an acre, wheat lands from
<35.t0 ?20 an acre; fruit and alfalfa
lsjids under irrigation from $30 to $100
an acre, according to location and
quality. Many large holdings are sub
divided and placed on the market In
ten, twenty and forty acre tracts, at
jirices ranging from 540 to $75 an acre.
These lands are under irrigation and
are situated within a few miles of
towns. Small farms are rapidly be
comiug a feature of Tulare County. !
.Colonies are near towns and have good
telephone service and daily mail de
4iver>\ making social conditions agree-*
able.
Qt course the climate of Tulare
County is made the subject of special I
comment. It is called to the attention
of the reader, by the Tulare County
Board of Trade that during July and
August, which are" known as the hot
xriOi:ths. the thermometer will indicate
temperatures ranging from 60 degrees
at sunrise to 98 or 100 degrees at noon.
Jn what are known as hot years the
mercury will occasionally register 108
degrees. This Is designated as excep
tional and the reader is requested to re
member that the heat is dry and, there
"being 6O little humidity in the air, it
Is not of the oppressive character that
afflicts the people east of the Rocky
mountains. '

" CTPorttinely the Tulare County
Board of Trade has Just -issued a
bonk telling about the wealth and re-
Wources of Tolare. From it an ade
quate idea of the real importance of
This fruitful county may be derived.
The county extends northerly and
{\u25a0vuiherly sixty-five miles and is seven
ty-five to 100 miles wide. It extends
from the Sierra Nevada mountains on
â¢ihe east to the Coast range mountains
en the west. It is Just about half
-. .iv between San Francisco and Los
.Xr.ireles. Its area is 4Â£33 square miles
or 3.11>5,0iÂ»0 acres.
lus eastern boundary, beginning at
tbe . crest of the Sierras, embraces
'â¢Mount Whitney, whose hoary head has
an altitude of 15,000 feet, the highest
MUnaiit in the United States. The
county has a population of 25,000. The
principal cities and towns are: Vlsalia,
Tuhire. Porterville, Dinuba, Exeter,
Lindsay. Orosi and Tipton. Visalia.
Ahe county seat, has a population of
42001
VAST WATERSHED.
AS the eastern boundary of the coun
ty begins at the crest of the .Sierra and
.c-V. traces a series of the highest peaks
iri California, its watershed has a vast
Fi'ze.- From it flow the Kaweah, St.
â¢Johns, Tule and White rivers and Peer
Creek. Camtron Creek,. Packwood
Creek. Mill Creek. Cross Creek, Deep
Creek. Elk Bayou and Poso Creek. The
r.uuntain streams furnish sufficient
water to irrigate thousands of acres
with systems wf gravity canals that
AtvÂ«rt the Said from the streams. Be
neath the surface of the land is an
irrxhaustibJe Espply of waled The
. Aiacawrjy of this rubierranean supply,
<nr . enc&aa uÂ£ electric power plants
â¢and the advent of unlimited quantities
of cheap fuel oil have made irrigation
by purrp pystems feasible. Under this
plan water is procurable for irrigation
et a cost of from 25 cents to *2 50 an
acre.
â¢The fniTffnin?r facts are .taken from
the book th* Tulare County Board of
Trade has adopted. A. E. Miot is the
*uther; In addition to this general in
forination the Board of Trade supplies
entertaining reading that deals with
the conditions under which the various
Indtrstries of the county are conducted.
It is assorted that the cust of water
.for irrigation, from the gravity canals,
*is 40 ciÂ»r.tÂ£ to Jl 25 an acre a year. The
gravity canals belong to the lands that
they irrigate. The farmers In early
day? filed water appropriations on the
"rivers and other streams, built the
.ditches and paid themselves in water
stock. As a consequence the water
â¢cof;s thÂ« farmer? annually just the
cost of the maintenance of the canals
* amd the delivery therefrom. The citrus
fruit orchards naturally require more
water than others. The cost to them
an acre a year runs from $1 to to.
â¢ A .picture of plenty is alluringly pre
sented simply by an enumeration of
the products of Tulare. These include
* >vheat. barley, alfalfa, Indian corn,
Evaet potatoes, Irish potatoes, vegeta
bles cf all sens, peaches, prunes, pears,
-tT'rieots, apples, olives, figs, plums, al
rr.onds, walnuts, raisins, table grapes,
Wine grapes, oranges, lemons, limes
and berries of all varieties.

LEADVILLE, Col., Sept 25. â The
Leadville District Mining Association,
which takes in every mine manager in
the district, has decided to issue work
ing cards for the purpose of carry
ing on the fight against the Western
Federation of Miners. Notices will be
posted at every mine In the camp to
morrow, to the effect that no person
will be employed who shall not have
deposited with the timekeeper his
card of recommendation from the
mining association." An office will be
opened in the city, where the cards
will be <ssued.
Every applicant will be required to
sign a statement that he is not a
member of the Federation, or of any
order controlled thereby. If he Is a
member of the Federation he will
be required to renounce his allegi
ance to the Federation.
The mine owners here believe that
the Federation is seeking to fcecure
foothold in Leadville, a large number
of Cripple Creek miners having come
here since the trouble in that district.

The phantom ship which has been re
ported to be flitting to and fro off the
upper western coast of North America
and which_was sighted from the crest
of Mount Tamalpais Saturday morning
thirty miles at sea taking land bearings
and photographs of the Golden Gate,
and finally disappearing to the south
west steaming rapidly, is not known to
have destroyed any commerce up to
this date, and the water front is
breathing with Its customary freedom.
Marino watchers along the coast, the
Government weather observers on
Mount Tamalpais and the State pilots
out at sea have used their long distance
glasses in hopes of seeing the myste
rious stranger, but she has been too
illusive for them. She has gone to the
southwest steaming rapidly, and is
probably busy in some unknown por
tion of the ocean developing the photo
graph she took of the Golden Gate.
Captain Jordap, who piloted the
steamship Nevadan into this port Sat
urday morning, did not observe any
craft answering to the description/ of
the spectral stranger, though he was
in the alleged locality of the vessel at
the time she waa reported to have been
seen. Two pilot boats have since been
cruising over that ground and have
seen no flagless warship taking land
bearings on the coast, eliminating the
bare possibility of the British cruiser
Flora being out from Esquimalt and
steaming along the coast â and an Eng
lish naval vessel's nationality from her
peculiar construction and color can be
made out many leagues at sea â the
probability of a foreign warship playing
hide-and-seek in this locality is too re
mote for even a water front Joke.
The Chilean training ship General
Baquedano, en route from Yokohama to
Valparaiso and due to call at this port,
is expected every day. But as she is an
old vessel and moreover may be leis
urely sailing across the Pacific under
no special time schedule, her appear
ance cannot be dated. However, she
will not take any photographs of the
harbor entrance and her navigator will
have all the land bearings he needs
long before he makes the coast, and
she will come into the harbor without
any mystery.

LOS ANGELES. Sept. 25.â On and af
ter November 1 It will cost the citrus
growers of Southern California $1 In
stead of $1 25 per hundred pounds to
ship their lemons to points east of the
Missouri River. This reduction, one of
the most important transportation
concessions in the history of the mar
keting of the citrus products of this
end of the State, was decided upon at
Chicago to-day in the annual meeting
of the Transcontinental Freight Asso
ciation. A committee of the directors
of the Southern California Fruit Ex
change presented to the Southern Pa
cific and the Santa Fe and through
them to their connecting lines, the ne-'
cesslty for a reduced transcontinental
tariff to relieve the crippled condition
of the lemon industry, a condition
brought about by a combination of
circumstances that had conspired to
cut the growers' profits to nothing.
By the final success of the Southern
California Fruit Exchange in securing
a freight reduction of 25 cents per
hundred pounds the lemon Industry of
Southern California is rreed of a spo
liation at the hands of the railroads
of nearly $180,000 a y$ar, taking the
lemon shipments of the last year as a
fair average output.

ST. LOUIS AND WASHINGTON
EACH CAPTURE ONE GAME
Each boxer is a champion in his
class, and the man who would at
tempt to dope out a winner would
indeed be brave. While Gans has
done practically everything that has
been asked of him, he could never
think of meeting Russell and the
other giants which Walcott has faced
in the ring. Gans expects to win,
but he knows it will be difficult to
get a match at his own weight after
defeating so formidable a fighting ma
chine as Walcott. Â»
A glance over the records of the
men shows the match is one of the
most remarkable ever made. Â»
Gans took a twelve-mile run yester
day, returning to his quarters covered
with mud, but showing no fatigue.
In the afternoon he had on the gloves
for the first time, boxing six hard
rounds with Kid Sullivan. The latter
was quickly in distress and Gans could
have stopped him at any time. Gans
enjoyed the glove work so thoroughly
he -will continue it until Wednesday.
A- big crowd visited Walcott's quar
ters at Oakland and saw him do a big
day's work. He covered nearly fifteen
miles on the road in the morning for
a starter. In the afternoon he worked
on the apparatus for an hour. He
then had nine fast rounds of boxing,
taking on three different men. Wal
cott's latest bulletin reads:
"You can just say that I'll be at
weight on the night of the fight, and
I'll beat Mr. Gans until he will want
to jump out of the ring." â¢
The followers of boxing are \ com
mencing to take the Gans-Walcott
fight seriously. The sale of seats will
commence to-morrow.* Manager Greg
gains has received advance orders
whN?h indicate that a big crowd will
witness the contest.
Contest Between the Lightweight and
the Weltesweight Champion Should

afternoon and for six Innings kept the
Siwashes from reaching the plate. It
was a fine exhibition of twirling, but
not a bit better than that of Nick Wil
liams. "Hogg wrenched his right arm
at the shoulder in the sixth inning. He
pitched the inning through, but then
retired and was taken to a physician.
The doctor thinks he will be all right
again in two weeks. Seattle broke the

SUMMARY.
Wrenches His Arm During the Sixth
Inning; and Retires.
PITCHER HOGG INJURED.
A story came from Seattle last
night to the effect that Manager Parke
Wilson of the Seattle team has been
traded for Tommy Leahy and the
two will change places at once. The
deal is shrouded in mystery and was
probably put through by Theodore
Goodman, now in the north with the
Seals.
Shake-Up on Uncle's Team.
George Janes and George Busch had
an easy time with E. P. Bobbins and
H. Spring. The score was 6-3, 6-1.
W. G. Knowlton and C. Pritchard
played three close sets. Knowlton was
at his best, and after losing the first
set won the next two. The score was
5-7, 8-6, 6-4.
Little and O'Hara won two sets out
of three from Dr. Noble and- Lisser.
The score was 6-2, 1-6, 6-4.
The rain interfered with the tennis
games yesterday and but few matches
were played. The courts did not dry
until almost noon, and only four
matches were completed in the first
bay counties championship tournament.
None of the best players participated
in these with the exception of Dunlap,
who almost met defeat at the hands of
a lower class man.
The ma^ch' between Dunlap and I* S.
Howell was the first played, and a big
surprise almost resulted. Dunlap took
matters easy at the start and was in
clined to underrate his opponent,
Howell won the first set easily, the
score being 6-3. He led at 4-2 in the
second set, and Dunlap made a des
perate but unsuccessful effort to pull
out the set. Howell won by a 7-5 score.
In the last three sets Dunlap played his
best game and won easily. The score
was 3-6, 5-7, 6-0, 6-2, 6-1.
G. Guerin and Guy Lytton also fig
ured in a long five-set match. The
players were evenly matched and
Guerin won by a small margin. The
score was 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2.
The three other matches played were
all one-sided. S. W. Guerin beat S.
Simon, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3. E. P. Pinnegan
beat L,. Joseph, 6-0, 6-1, 6-3. Charles
Teller beat C. Quick, 6-0, 6-0, 6-0.
A few of the cracks were out at the
California Club courts and one /good
doubles match was played. J. D. Mac-
Gavin and Percy Murdock, to the sur
prise of all, lost to W. B. Collier and
Carl Gardner. The score was 6-4, 3-6,
6-4.

Takes the Next Three Without

WOODEN TOTEM POLES
XO LONGER THE FASHION*
Indians *of Southeastern Alaska Pre
fer Marble Shafts to the Monu
ments of Their Forefathers.
TACOMA, Sept. 25. â The custom of
Alaska Indians to erect -wooden totem
poles to mark the last resting 1 place of
their chiefs has changed. Many of
the tribes of Southeastern Alaska have
adopted marble, and It is left to the
white man to carve the totem- from a
model furnished by natives. : \; . '
Two marble totems have been
carved by a local marble company for
the Chilkat Indians at Halnes' Mis
sion at a cost of $850. One totem is
a tall white shaft surmounted by a
whale killer. The body of the other to
tem represents *Â» bear.

Ouida, winner of a stake a week ago,
ran in excellent form, but succumbed
to Orsina in the final of the Class
stake. Ouida had a hard trial during
the fifth round ln a bye with Sacra
mento Boy, which affected her chances
of capturing the flag in the final. Reck
less Acrobat/ after beating Sacramento
Boy decisively, was made favorite over
Crsina in the third round. Orsina won
the course by a score of 6 to 1. The
rain seemed to take the speed out of
the hares, as nearly all the courses
were short runs. Following are the re
sults with Judge John Grace's official
scores:
Form players had a hard day pick
ins winnera yesterday at Ingleside
Coursing Park. Favorites were beaten
with unusual frequency. Fair Flying:,
the winner of the Reserve stake, treat
ed the talent harshly. They laid odds
against her In several trials only to find
their judgment was wrong. Orsina
captured the Class stake. He was the
outsider In the betting- on two occa
sions.
, The pistol champions of the day
proved to be W. C Prichard and G. E.
Frahm of the Golden cate Club, who
scored twice 91 each out of a possible
100 rinss.
In the same club Martin F. Blasse,
in rifle competition, led his comrades
with 229 rings to his credit.
The delegates who have been ap
pointed by the various rifle clubs of
California and the Pacific Coast for the
purpose of forming a Pacific Coast
shooting bund will meet this evening
at 8 o'clock at Odeon Hall. D. B. Fak
tor, the weil ''nown champion, will call
the delegate to order. As all the

SUMMARY.
The weather- was threatening when
the game was called at 2:30 o'clock and
held out fairly well for three innings.
Then Umpire Buck Francks, who was
acting in McDonald's stead, announced
that the game would be called for
twenty minutes and if the weather
would permit action would be resiimed
when the time limit had expired.
But the rain never ceased. Instead
it came down harder. Eugene Bert,
president of the league, had a confab
with Francks when the twenty minutes
was up, and then to the disgust of fans
and players alike, the game was re
sumed.
The ball tossers objected strenuously
to trotting out on that sloppy diamond,
but the umpire had -to <lo as he was
told and these unlucky mortals were
forced to run around in the rain and
mud so that the league might save a
few paltry dollars in rain checks.
As long as the game was resumed
tliere was no excuse of calling it till
the nine innings had been played out.
At any rate the umpire ordered hostili
ties to cease with Doc Newton at the
bat for Los AÂ» geles in the seventh inn
ing and one nan out. Of course, no
rain checks were handed out and a lit
tle money was saved. i
The players were all disheartened.
Nearly all of. them went out upon the
field with their coats on and each was
fearful that he might make a false
step and perhaps break a leg or an
arm. But nobody got any rain checks
and the league saved a little money.
The game itself was a farce and
should not count in the official aver
ages. The 'Angels got a run in the
third round when Flood was safe on
Schlafley's error and Brashear got a
dinky hit that would have been an
easy out on a good field. Cravath flew
to Byrnes, but. Chase singled over sec
ond and brought Flood home with the
only run.
Both Buchanan and Newton pitched
grand ball under the existing condi
tions. The Commuters had men on
bases several times, but the curve's of
the big fellow were too deep a mystery
when a run seemed due. The morning
game was declared off on account of a
sloppy field. The score:
Oakland â I Los Angeles â

The magnates who manipulate the
Pacific Coast Baseball League have al
ways been known to grab all the coin
in sight, but nobody ever thought these
same big minded men would compel
eighteen ball players to wallow for
four innings on a muddy field just for
the sake of a few paltry dollars. But
they stooped this low yesterday and
ordered the members of the Oakland
and the Los Angeles team to risk life
and limb so that the spectators might
be beaten out of a few rain checks.
When the game was called in the sev
enth inning- Los Angeies was in the
lead, 1 to 0.
Such an outrageous thing has never
been heard of on any ball field in the
history of the national game. The
players were so dumfounded that they
hardly realized what had happened.
As for the spectators, they hooted and
jeered and called for rain checks. After
the allotted five innings had been reeled
off and the crowd was not entitled to
tickets for another game, the farce
was soon declared off.

$2100, but will use. it to pay for the
services of an attorney. Late Satur

Two men were arrested while "work

The men have criminal records as pick

however, lies another story. One of the
men arrested is suspected of being the
"ringer," or alleged double, of Charles,
"Wyman, accused of stuffing a ballot
box at the last primary election by

man. Yesterday afternoon Detectives
Ryan and Taylor noticed four men at
the beach acting in a suspicious man

ture the men, but two managed to get
away. The two men taken Into custody
were brought to the Hall of Justice and
their names entered on - the detinue

ing which could be classed as plunder
was found in their possession, but they

AS TO MISSING BROTHER
A man giving his name as A. John
eon was arrested by Detectives Ryan
and Taylor last night. He is under
suspicion of having stolen several hun
dred dollars' worth of merchandise
from the firm by which he was em
ployed. It is claimed that Johnson
had a confederate. The detectives are
looking for the other man.
Johnson's employers began to miss
valuable goods several weeks ago.
They hired a private detective to look
into* the affair. He found clews that
pointed to Johnson as the thief. Ryan
and Taylor placed their prisoner's
name on the detinue book, fearing
that if the news of his capture got
out the confederate would be fright

him to-day.

Last Tuesday, at the conference at
Pacific Grove, Bishop L V B. Wilson ap
pointed Mr. Williams to succeed the
Rev. Mr. Stephens, who has been as
signed for the coming year to Central
Church, Stockton, one oi the largest
churches in the California Conference.
Simpson Memorial Church, Hayes
and Buchanan streets, was crowded
yesterday morning when the newly ap
pointed pastor, the Rev. J. H. N. Wil
liams, conducted his first service in
the church. "The Conquering Christ"
was the subject' of "his sermon, which
was delivered in a clear, impressive
manner that convinced the worshipers
that their new pastor, like his prede
cessor, the Rev. John Stephens, is an
exceptionally strong man.
The Rev. Mr. Williams is a native
son and was born in Nevada City 37

HANDSOME WOMAN WHO PLATS
THE LEADING ROLES IN THE
BEN GREET COMPANY.
Rev. J. H. N. Williams As
sumes Charge of Simp-,
son Memorial.
REV. J. H. N. WILLIAMS. WHO
HAS JUST BEEN APPOINTED
PASTOR OF CITY CHURCH.
A meeting of Union 003 will be held
at 915*2 Market street at 7 o'clock to-
Bight and on its adjournment a meet-
Ing of Union 19. to which the members
of 509 are invited, will be held in Crys
tal Hall, Pythian Castle.
Brief remarks were made by Robert
L>aurin. who presided over the meet
ing; R. T. Mclvor. C. S. Perry. B. G.
Hyden and Joseph Tuite. The speak
ers all applauded the Judge for his de
cision, which they considered as the
fairest that could have been rendered.
â¢ The direct result of the decision will
be the making of a formal demand on
the Building Trades Council that the
delegates from Union 19 be seated. A
demand for recognition will also be
made on the Brotherhood of Painters
and Decorators. If these demands are
ret honored further litigation will fol
low.
The meeting yesterday was addressed
by ex-Congressman Julius Kahn, who
fully explained the nature of the de
cision and made valuable suggestions
to the members of the union as to their
future course of action. He was heart
ily applauded and his suggestions will
he followed out.
The decision of Judge Hunt dissolved
the temporary injunction heretofore is
sued and was a distinct victory for
Union No. 19 and a defeat to what is
known as the "Sheehan faction." Un
ion 503 was not directly involved in the
litigation, but its sympathies were with
the members of No. 19. Had the deci
sion been adverse to the latter organi
zation, 50t> would also undoubtedly have
been drawn into the dispute.
A joint meeting of Painters' unions
Nos. 19 and M3 was held at 3 o'clock
yesterday afternoon to consider the
tveeat decision of Judge Hunt and
lay plans for future action.
The two Pucks, a boy and .a girl, got
the. glad hand right from the start.
The boy has a good, clear voice and the
girl was really clever. She gave some
imitations of Harry Le Claire's imita
tions. "Mrs- Rosenbaum, in the Great
Diamond Robbery" was the remark
able mimicry. Her lone joke, "We only
get 10 a week and cakes for this." was
given with the sang froid of a veteran.
John P. Kennedy and Carrie Reynolds
did some eccentric dancing, interspers
ed with nejy songs and moderately new
gags. The Carrie half of the team is
pretty and graceful. James, in a mes
senger boy uniform, and Bonnie in very
little pinafore and very > much black
stocking also danced and sane. The
new series .of motion pictures showed
how many tricks can be played with
The stars of yesterday's bill at the
Orpheum came on just before the pict
ures and the rush for fresh air.' They
are Urbanl and Son, "phenomenal Eu
ropean athletes," Urbani' is the ath
lete and the son is the phenomenon.
Think of a little fellow just about the
spanking size who can carry his husky
parent on his shoulders and balance
him on his hands. That's what Ur
bani's son does.
After all uncle is the leading man.
He is a sort of Sol Smith Russell. James
Herne-like figure, and but for his ag
gravating habit of forgivin' Simon Pe
ter, a rather lovable person. The rest
of the characters are bravely tradition
al and the slight thread of the story
heavily obscured by incongruous, but
sometimes engaging, incident. At
times the dialogue is quaint and Hu
man and the play mildly amusing;
Of the performance last night it is
not wholly fair to judge. They have
the Sunday matinee fashion at the
Grand Opera-house and yesterday af
ternoon "York State Folks" arrived
minus the scenery. Half past 2 o'clock
brought out an explanatory press
agent. Money back was generously of
fered, the discontented and the orches
tra worked overtime to amuse the rest.
By 3:30 the audience was invitinc one
another to pink teas and at 3:35 the
curtain went up. It went down 'round
about 7 o'clock, after a fusillade of in
quiries at the box office for the miss
ing.
The circumstances, it must be grant
ed, were not wholly happy, but the per
formance last night was perhaps less
joyful. It suggested irreverently that
the plentiful shavings of the third act
had been liberally employed in the
cast. Barring the uncle Ray L. Royce,
Simon Peter, James Lackaye, Osborne
Searle, Frances Young and perhaps
Eleanor Sidman, the figures are ! all
stuffed. Ray L. Royce pleases as the
uncle, in a gentle, drawly, sententious
fashion, something like our old friend
Frank JBacon. You can hear what he
has to say,- which is more than can
even generously be said of Mr. Lack
aye. Still, Lackaye seems compara
tively (with the rest) alive, and Miss
Young is natural and pleasing. as the
Widow Miller. Osborne Searle and
Eleanor Sidman have one minute of
pretty love-making. The. rest of the
York State Folks are only shadow
shapes when thev are not caricatures.
The scenery was worth waiting for, by
the way.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
UXCLK KEEPS THE SECRET.
As we were saying, however, the son
rebels. In spite of all temptations he
decides to forget father's parental
achievements and leave 'ome. Father
tears up the shavings in the third act
and shows him the door. But it all
"conies out right" in the end, though
not at all according to the parental
gospels of G. B. Shaw â among which
is the extraordinary doctrine that a
father owes at least as much courtesy
to his offspring to his_barber. The
trouble with Simon Peter Martin's son
is that he has fallen in love with SimoiÂ»
Peter's friend, the enemy's ' niece.
(Even she tells him to "remember he's
his father.") But Martin Jr. has
gambled and involved the good old
uncle. Papa does not know this.
In "York State Folks" at the Grand
Opera-house this week they are chief
ly occupied in "remembering he's his
father." Father doesn't deserve it.
He is the boss curmudgeon of Mar
tinsville, as well as its leading wagon
maker. He insults the whole popula
tion, from his wife down, and when
his son rebels they have nothing to say
but "remember he's - your father."
Needless to say, the play is not by
George Bernard Shaw. While one is
about it "York State Folks" claims to
be a "pastoral play" and is by Arthur
Sidman.
The chairman appointed by the Sen
atorial district delegates was John S.
Partridge, Deputy City Attorney. Har
ry Hall was chosen secretary. John -W.
King made a short speech nominating
Senator Welch, whose election by the
delegates was unanimous. The neces
sary business accompanying the nom
ination was transacted, and after a
short speech by Charles M. Shortridge
the meeting adjourned.
Immediately following the Senatorial
meeting the delegates of the Thirty
fifth Assembly District were called to
order by John S. Partridge, the chair
man, and E. F. Treadwell was unan
imously chosen. After some routine
business the meeting adjourned.
The Thirty-fourth Assembly District
delegates to the Republican local con
vention met at Twin Peaks Hall yes
terday and organized by the election of
Vincent Dolan as chairman and Ben F.
Jones as secretary. The candidacy of
Fred Severance for the Assembly was
indorsed.
There is gossip in political circles to
the effect that Markey, the nominee of
the Union Labor party for State Sen
ator from the Seventeenth District, and
Mindhan, the nominee of the same par
ty for Assemblyman from the Twenty
eighth District, are to be indorsed by
the Republican delegates to-night.
In the Republican ranks of the Sev
enteenth Senatorial and Twenty-eighth
Assembly districts the earnest hope is
expressed that small bosses and politi
cal maniDUlators will keep hands off
and give the Republican leaders and
workers an opportunity to name the
candidates for the Legislature from
these districts. It is asserted that Re
publican unity and strength cannot be
promoted by fusion. The regular stal
wart workers of the Republican party
want straight out Republican nomina
tions, and express the hope ,that A.
Ruef, John C. Lynch and other non
residents of the Seventeenth Senatorial
District will not mix in and hand out
slates to the delegates. The districts
are now represented by Democrats, and
the success of a fusion movement would
not better conditions in a political
sense. Markey and Mindhan hate in
dorsed the platform and principles of
the Union Labor party, and it is argued
that they cannot consistently approve
the nrinclples and policies of the Re
publican party. The Republicans of
the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth
districts, however, insist on the right
of preserving their party organization
by nominating well-known Republicans
for the Legislature.
With nerfect unanimity the Repub
lican defegates of the Nineteenth Sen
atorial District met yesterday afternoon
in the Mission Masonic Hall and nom
inated Richard J. Welch, who has just
completed a term as Senator from the
Nineteenth, for re-election. Following
the meeting of the Senatorial district,
the Thirty-fifth Assembly District held
a short meeting and nominated Edward
F. Treadwell as its candidate for As
semblyman. The Thirty-second Assem
bly District, which with the Thirty
flfth forms the Nineteenth Senatorial
District, did not hold a meeting, or
ganization being lacking in the ranks
of the delegates.
. Delegates to the local nominating
convention of the Republican party,
who were chosen at the primary elec
tion on August 9, will meet at Pioneer
Hall this evening. Candidates for the
Legislature and four Judges of the Su
perior Court are to be nominated. In
several districts legislative nominees of
the party have already been named,
and the subject of ratifying such selec
tions by the main convention may be
introduced. In the Nineteenth Sena
torial District Richard J. Welch has
been renominated. In the Twenty
third Senatorial District George B.
Keane has received the nomination.
