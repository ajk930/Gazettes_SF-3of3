between the Department of Justice and
Harmon and Judson, who recently re
signed, as special counsel for the Gov^
ernment In the rebate case Involving tho
Santa Fe road and the Colorado .Fuel
and Iron Company. Harmon- and Jud
son wished to brlns contempt proceed
ings against the officers of the . road;
which would have Included Mr. Mor
ton. Their Intention was, with the
testimony adduced before the Inter-j
state Commerce Commission, to estab
lish** violation of a * court , order "of
March 25/1901, \u25a0 restraining the com
pany from completing any agreement
to transport Interstate traffic at rates
lower than -the published tariff, of the
road. This testimony, they contended,
constituted a prlroa' fade case against
the officers of the ; road and the only
way .to ascertain their,; guilt or Inno
cence was through contempt pro
ceedings.
v Attorney General Moody. opposed tha
bringing "of -contempt proceedings Ton
the ground that, while the evidence be-^
forÂ©\tne commission might sho-w. a vio
lation of the "Injunction by, the road, it
contained. nothing charslns any' officer
of * the company with such violation.
President Roosevelt Is of. the same
view." Both'the President and the At
torney- General agreed that contempt
proceedings should be Instituted im
personally against the corporation :in
both "the Colorado Fuel .C ompany , and

SHOT DOWN
BY TROOPS
LOS ANGELES. June 2Lâ According to
a private telegram from Chicago N. W.
Btowell, aged 88, of Los Angeles and
rated almost a millionaire, was married
there Tuesday to Miss Evelyn Wilkinson,
aged 22. This marriage partly explains a
Eociety mystery to which there was more
or less of a suspicion of scandal.
Stowell went to El Paso, Tex., and
there sued his wife for divorce. She
learned of It and filed a counter suit here.
Tbe divorce was granted May 2. Miss
"Wilkinson was for several months a
guest of Mrs. Etowell and Stowell met
her In his own home. At That time there
was not the slightest suspicion that they
were any more than friends, but Mrs.
Etowell's attorneys now assert that they
had known of a clandestine correspond
ence for months.
The bride's parents in Chicago bitterly
opposed the marriage and are said to
have forbidden Stowell their house.
The Â£to wells have lived in Los Angeles
a long time and the Stowell block on
Spring street was their property." }Vhen
the divorce was granted Mrs. Stowell re
ceived about JJ50.000.

withdraw, his . plea and enter, upon trial
when, he", wished until tsentence had been

Senator j Thurston addressed the court in
objection to' the- testimonj-. He called
attention to^-the: journal . in which was
entered the statement and plea^of guilty
entered by Judge Tanner to an indict

speaker read from the R'evlsed Statutes of

that' no person guilty of perjury can be
used : as , a witness In the Federal \ court.
He contended that under the v section the

The' next letter of the series was ad
dressed to the Attorney General by Har
mon and Judson, and referred to a con
ference which had been held in Wash
ington the week preceding its date. April
1L It reviewed their recommendation of
March 11, that further testimony be taken
and added that this testimony was de
6irable, not so much with a view of, pro
curing proof of the violation of the in
junction as a basis for. contempt pro
ceedings against the railroad company
and its officers, with a view of procuring
detailed proof of unlawful shipments, so
as to have a proper basis of proceeding
under the criminal provisions, of the
Elkins act against the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company and Its officers.
The letter then argued that testimony
taken before a master would be limited
as to the contempt phase of the case
unless contempt charges were first filed
and an order, to show cause were issued
against the railroad company and Its
officers. The distinction was made , that
in the contempt proceedings It would only
be necessary to * produce proof that the
injunction . had been violated, while in a
criminal prosecution detailed proof of
special shipments would have to be
shown. Â«
In a letter dated May 19, the Attorney
General disapproved of contempt proceed
ings as suggested by the special counsel.
Tire letter follows:
COXSIDEnATIOX FOR MOItTOHT.
The order to take further testimony,
requested in the letter to the special
counsel on March 11. was iesued by the
Attorney General in a letter dated March
Zl. which concluded with the statement
that ne preferred to hear all the recom
mendations of the special counsel before
considering the question of the proper ac
tion to be taken against the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Company. Again
on March Â£7, in a letter to the special
counsel, the Attorney General said:
Before proceedings for contempt or criminal
proceedings against the railroad and fuel com
panies or their officers Or agents are begun I
desire ' that all the material facts should be
before the department and that the depart
ment ehould have the benefit of your advice
vjwm them. . . \u25a0

We both understood our report to recoai
tnÂ«nd proceeding* In contempt In the suit of
th*. Unlit-d States against the Atchtaon, To
peka and Santa Fe Railroad Company at Km
Â«-ss CUy without waiting the result of future
lnveetiÂ£atlonÂ« -svith reference to other action
against It or thÂ» Colorado Fuel and Iron Com
pany, It* officers and agents. If. however, we
understand from your letter you think it best
not to take these proewflings in contempt until
ive ehail have reported on the advisability
of such further proceedings, we shall, of course,
make our investigations and report as early
as *t can.
The letter concluded with a suggestion
that an order be issued for the taking of
further testimony before an examiner In
Kansas City. On March 20 the Attorney
General again was addressed by Messrs.
Harmon and Judson, who said:
W f come to cay that we have made an In
formal Investigation which confirms our pre
vious report*. We can go no further- .without .
the use of proces* to secure formal evidence
and other proof and therefore again recom
mend contempt proceedings and . the taking
cf testimony before the committee appointed \u25a0
for the purpose in tne care pending In the
United States Circuit Court at Kansas City.
*Ac have no doubt that the laws have been
vfolated by the traffic ot fleers of the Atchison.

those x>f the Coloreda Fuel and Iron Company.
The-former-Have by the- same acts- fiolated the
lnjundfori in' that case.-- The formal proof
required to punlrf. them for contempt of court
and alÂ»a criminally, if it shall be thought
beet to <5o that, too, can be had only by
Juflicial process. This 1Â« ready to our hands
la the above r.amefl case. The proof elicited
before the- matter will also be available for
criminal proceedings against the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company and its officers and agents.
As we have said, we can go no further and
n*ed go no further with Informal investiga
tions. WÂ« are confident that the claims are
an we have gtat*<3 them and it only remains
ts put the proof in legal form.
We beg. therefore, that this be considered

\u25a0which such transportation was Interstate com
merce. Thlf \veÂ» done by a secret arrange
ment betwÂ«*n the two companies, under which
the coal was apparently billed at the pub
lished rate cr freight, although in fact the
price of thÂ« coal v>au Included. The railroad
company collected the amount shown by the
billings and paid over part of it to the fuel
company se the price of the coal, making
the real charge for transportation less than
the published rate by Just that amount. ' At
the Fame time the rates given and charged
other ehippers were the published tariff rates
without any reduction. This plan and the
way it whs carried out were plainly to deceive
the Government arffl'th* public and to enable
the fuel compart x ao gain a monopoly cf the
coal supply at the points involved by giving
them a etrong advantage, over competitors
in the actual cost of transportation. The motfve
lor thus favoring the fuel company doe* not
appear In tlÂ«* evidence thus tar taken, but the
lact is clear.
The letter recites that <wriy one of the
chief officers. of either company had been I
called ac a witness, and that no imrnu- I
nity from preeecution could bo claimed
by any of the other officers of either com
pany. - No .papers hAd been submitted by
the fuÂ«l corÂ»pany, and consequently no
immunity could be for it. Cer
tain papers had. been submitted by the
railroad coiapany,' but only-'sueh as are
by law made public, consequently no im
munity <Jaim would' stand thereby. Har
mon and Judeon proceeded to argue that
the railroad company and all its principal
of ficeis, perhaps including some" subordi
nate officers and agents, be arraigned for
contempt of court for making and carry-
Ing out the agreement referred to. w \u25a0"
IVO DOUHT OF 'VIOLATION*.
In replying to this letter. onVMarch 8,
Attorney General Moody expressed sat
isfaction with the- progress made in the
Investigation, -and concluded . with the
statement that upon its completion he
would confer with, the counsel regarding
the action to be taken. - Three days later
the special counsel, replying to the letter
of the Attorney General, said:

acrevtlÃs L your resignation permit me to \u25a0 as-
between us as to 'proceeding against the cor
poration itself. If the tiVnsactions set forth
' In the report of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission In regard to the departure from the

But. you go further and report proceedings

pany. Including presumably the president, the
vice president in charge of.. the. traffic depart

and .other, officers whose duties relate to "the

WOULD t ELIMINATE OFFICERS.
I have -examined. -this, report, and.,a.^rans
| cript of the testimony taken by the commls
\u25a0 slon. I do not find any testimony relating
I to the conduct of any ; except minor of flclals
and Mr. Biddle. who may claim to -have ob-
Ulned immunity by: testifying , flilly . before
the commission. '. For instance," to be specific,
there Is not. a seintllla of -testimony that Mr.
R*pley, the president of the road, or Mr. Mor
ton. th*n one of its vice presidents.' had any
connection with the .-evident' departure from
the published rates jin favor of the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company, or that they knew, or
suspected that transportation was furnished.' to
tms company in any manner different â¢ from:
that prescribed by the- open and published rate.,
rvelther of these officials were in the remotest
way referred to in the : testimony or in the
report of the commission. Surely; It would
not be contended that upon this etate of facts
tnat these official* . were subject to a penalty
for contemnt of court.
:Nor have I understood that it has been your
opinion that upon such, a state of facts any
Individuals would be liable to punishment for
contempt. Your view, as I have understood It,
has been that, as corporations must always
act through their officers and agents there is
a presumption that those who are charged
with the management of their affairs are re
.sponnlble for the conduct of a corporation
which violates an injunction; that that- pre
sumption warrants an accusation for contempt
against Its officers and agents where the cor
poration has bÂ«en guilty of contempt, and that
upen investigation of the accusation testimony
may be taken which will show whether, or not
the officers accused hax-e themselves been
guilty of any conduct which has -aided in
bringing the corporation ' into . contempt of
cpurt. .. * : . \u0084 . r..- .;:;'.'- . '--
I do net Understand, however, \u25a0 that" with
<meh evidence you would be of the opinion that
any officer or-sgent would be liable to the
penalty for contempt.
After great consideration I am of the opin
ion that some evidence ought; to precede the
accusation and that an accusation so grave in
its character ought not to be made unless
there appears before It Ip made some evidence
in support of It.' I realize fully that I have,
the power to make the accunatlon. and no one
can question it. Â« The possession of the power
carries with It. however, the responsibility for
Its scrupulous exercjs*. In this case, upon the
facts which I nave stated. I have reached the
conclusion that I ought not to make the ap
plication for an attachment for contempt
against the officers of the railway company.
I have felt that it was due to you that you
should receive an exact statement of the
views which I entertain and the reasons which
have controlled my decision.
\u25a0 I have submitted the foregoing to the Presi
dent and he authorizes me.to say that he ap
proves the conclusion which I have reached,
and directs that . proceedings forf contempt of
the injunction be begun against the railroad
company only. Very respectfully,

HARMO.V AND JUDSON REftlGWiij(|
The letter In reply to this contain*;
the resignations of Messrs. Harmon and
Jud.son. It was dated at Cincinnati;
June 5. It follows:
We hayÂ« received and carefully, considered
your letter of the 19th ultimo, and regret that
you do not approve our recommendation of
February 2S last, which we repeated j with
further reasons in our letter of April 11. We
appreciate the very great weight to be given
jour conclusion, but we are deeply impressed
with the gravity of the matter and its im
portance as a precedent. We feel, therefore,
that wÂ« may, without Impropriety refer to
some things in your letter.
It is true that the report of the Interstate
Commerce Commission merely stated the facts
which show that the law had been violated
without attempting to fix responsibility on
any otflccrs . of the railroad company. The
reason for thin was that the commission limit
ed Us inquiry to the mere fact of such viola
tion and so stated (see testimony page 1341)
The violation by a corporation of an injunc
tion directed against it and its officers al
ways calls for a rule against such of them
as had control ovÂ«r Its conduct to show cause
.why they should not be held personally re
sponsible. They are prima facie guilty of
disobedience. It was their duty to see that
the act* t orbldden were not done as well aa
not to do them. .
The necessity of this rule is apparent as
well aa it* Juetk-e, The facts are peculiarly
within the knowledge of such officers and
subordinates . under their control. Except in
ca*es 60 rare that they may be called acci
dental .there are no means of discovering the
facts except by such a proceeding as we have
advised.
This well established rule, which is sufficient
to Justify the action proposed in any case
turned . and still seems to us peculiarly to
fit thÂ»- case in band. A rule against the con
trolling officers, of the railroad company to
show cause is elmply ihe recognition by the

official relation. It is a demand for an ex

necessarily presumptive evidence against its
principal officer* who had charge of the de
partment in question.
\VÂ« fully concur that no proceedings should
b# commenced '\u25a0\u25a0 without evidence, but facts pre

proceeding we recommend is not unususy or
txoepticnal, but, on the contrary, is the nat
ural .and ordinary one in such cases.
\Vbnt we have I said' Is peculiarly : true of

which we are now confronted are corporate

always personal. So iong.aa officials can hide
behind .their corporations no remedy can be

the laws will-be enforced. â¢ J ;. , ;

1 MR. MORTON DENIES GUILT.
At" about. the- same time that the injunction
was obtained against the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa- Fe, an injunction .was obtained against
'Several other Western "railroads. Subsequently
It was "developed by the Interstate Commerce
Commission that, under the guise of a division
of rates;. unlawful rebates were given by these
railroads tp ' the International: Harvester Com
pany, juet as a rebate .was" given by the Atchi
eon, Topeka and Santa Fe In the case of the
Colorado Fuel Company, g Upon attention being
called to the case by. the Interstate Commerce
Commission, tne . unlawful . practice was aban
doned in the harvester â¢ case, Â«s it. was aban
doned in the case of the Colorado Â» Fuel Com
pany. The two ' cases stand - precisely on a
par. No .one has suggested and, ' as . far as I
am aware, no one has thought of suggesting
that we should proceed' individually against;
the officers of the roads 'engaged in this Inter.
national Harvester Company affair; yet . the
cas4 is exactly parallel to this Atchison case,
and If such action : as you have ; refused to
take was taken 'against the officers of the-At
chlson, . Topeka and Santa Fe ' Railroad, lit
would aIBO have to 'be taken in 'the caae of
the. International- Harvester Company against
the officers of every | railroad running west of

against its officers. President Roosevelt
upholds this view in a reply under date

Notwithstanding all. Of these ''precautions ;
the other arrangement of billing the coal' ana.
coke at a- delivered price , and ) not separating
-the freight rate from the price of the com
modity, in the -tariff was not corrected until
some time last November. \u25a0* It was evidently;
not regarded. in! tbe.tariff printing bureau as
an Irregular arrangwhent and consequently es
caped attention. It 'might be considered that
it was a "mleplaced uwltch" in that bureau,
and neither the president of the road nor Mr.
Blddle, the freight traffic manager, nor. my-,
self, was any more responsible for It than the.
president or vice presldentior general manager
of any great railroad <f o the train . service
which may result in a bad wreck. All of our.
orders' were carefully, considered -and carefully,
.issued, but co far. as thla particularly is con
cerned seem to have, been overlooked. :*

no interest whatever In 'the Colorado Fuel and>
Iron Company. I sold my stock to that com-,
pany and all its auxiliary companies when I
left Its employ before entering â¢ the service
of the Atchison road in - 1895, and have not
been a stockholder of it or of any of Its sub
sidiary companies since. ,' My only. Interest In

develop either coal or oil fields menaced a
traffic \u25a0 worth nearly $1,000,000 a year to the
Atchison system, and solely for the protection '
of the : railroad, so far as its officers were
concerned, an: understanding was' entered, into
between the - railroad, the Colorado Fuel , Com
pany and the El Paso and. Southeastern Com
pany, the terms of which were:
COAL COMPANY AGREEMENT.
j .1. \ The Colorado Fuel Company was to'sup
ply the' coal- at a very low price at the
mines In Colorado, $1 15 per ton. This is
all they recelvedifor -the coal and. there' was
nothing additional paid them in the way 61
a rebate or otherwise. .. * \u25a0": - - ;
2. . The railroad company ; was to haul 'the (
coal at a very . low rate to' El 1 Paso and |
Deminr. the rate being $2 00 per ton. This
was ,in reality, a division of the rate not
usually published.
5i 3. The El Paso and : Southeastern people
were to receive and pay for the coal $4 05
per* ton at El Paso and Demlng:and--it was
to be used by the railroad Itself and the in
dustries alone its line. - \
. 4. The larifT covering this agreement was pub
) Hehed so as to Bhow the freight rate to be
$4 05 per ton Instead of the delivered price at
El Paso and Demlng and did not separate the
freight rate from the - cost of the coal at the
mines, as Tt should have done.; ;
Until the Investigation of the lease by the
Interstate Commerce Commission .1-. did not
know personally how the matter' was ; being,
handled as far as the publication of the tariff
was 3 concerned. : My own voneetlori . with ; the
case ' was to ccc that the tariff I was secured
to the Atchison , Rallroafl. and after that de
tails were, left to subordinates. - Thousands of
tariffs are published every year. â¢. k- â¢;' .
When this arrangement was entered Into the
Colorado . Fuel ; Company owned, . operated cr
controlled as general agents all the . coal , prop
ertles on the Atchison line in Colorado from
the district in '- which the rate applied; or in
other words; it was the only shipper, of .coal
from that district. over the Atchison rails, and
there was no -unjust discrimination -- against
.any other producer. It was a good thing, for
the coal district and for the Btate of â¢ Colo
rado as well as for other parties \u25a0 interested in
\u25a0the contract.- '\u25a0-' \u25a0'â¢--'.\u25a0
"The following year, or in 1902, ,the injunc-.
tions were Issued. I suppose it was not known
to you, certainly not to the public generally,
that it, was the' testimony which I gave before
the Interstate â¢ Commerce Commission . in the
practices of Western railroads so far. as grain,
dressed beet and provisions arrangements were
concerned "that made it possible to Â«ecure the
injunctions. : You can confirm this iby asking
Chairman . Knapp ?0f the Iftterstate Commerce
Commission, or â¢ Judge Day, who was at that
time the special 'counsel ror the commission.
Without my e\|idence it is quite unlikely that
the : injunctions could have been obtained.- I
was anxious to fee all the Western roads pre
vented-frcm doing things I knew were Irregular
and calculated to do the railroads as well as
the public generally great injustice. I was
aware of the fact . that .the practices about
which I testified were general. and they either
had to be stopped in some way or they . would

' I certainly would not shield you because you
are in my Cabinet, but equally certain I shall
not sanction an attack upon you which I
would not dream of sanctioning if' you had not
become a member of my Cabinet. Since I
accepted your resignation as a member of my
Cabinet you have undertaken perhaps the
\u25a0greatest and most important work now open to
any, buaineas man in assuming control of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society. You do
not 'need to be told again of the confidence
that. l have in you and my belief In your ab
solute sincerity, of 1 purpose and your unflinch
ing courage. - '"-, -
â¢I know from the mere fact that you have
consented to take control of the society that
there will be a ' clean management,' a control
really and .- honestly in the interest of the
policy-holders,, and one which will make Im
possible the crooked and objectionable practices
that have hitherto prevailed in the society.
Ex-President ! Cleveland in consenting to act
as one of the trustees to hold \u25a0 the stock of the
society " and to use the voting power of such
stock in the - selection of directors, conclude*
his letter by saying: "We shall be safer if
we regain our old habit of looking at the ap
propriation to ' personal uses of property and
interests held in trust in the same light as
Other forms of stealing." \u25a0 <\u25a0
In- other words, ydu and Mr. Cleveland in
tend to ccc that the affairs of the society are
managed . not merely with the honesty requi
site to keep clear of criminal proceedings, but
with the fine sense of honor which recognizes
in . the trustees, and that Is what the
man responsible for the management of
any great business corporation is now
adays, the duty of managing his business
affairs with a high sense of obligation, not
only to the stockholders and the policy holders
themselves, but also to the general public. Mr.
Cleveland has especially 'stipulated that he is
to be absolutely free and undisturbed In * the
exercise of his judgment. You have stipulated
that you are to be absolutely, free -and undis
turbed .In the exercise .of your ' Judgment. , : I
have faith in your will to do right and also
In the. Judgment -which will enable you >to do
right. J Ab I understand it, the majority of- the
stock' is to be put in; the hands* of a board of
trustees,. of which ' Mr. Cleveland has accepted
the chairmanship.' and they will have absolute
control, subject as .to the majority of the di
rectors to exercise their own judgment with
.out control.: Your own Dolicy will be, I know,
to give the policy holders a square deal and .to
clean ". house thoroughly. â¢ You . would - not ' take
such a position if -you did not have' a, perfectly

LOBB DEEMED
TRIFLE "OFF"
IN SAN DIEGO
Strikes Friend and
Leaves City to
Evade Arrest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
i SAN DIEGO, June 2Lâ Thomas Lobb
came to San Diego about two years ago.
but little is known here of his past. Hs
was a member ,of the San Diego Car
penters' Union and during most of the
time he was in this city was employed at
Fort Rosecrans by Solon Bryan. While
there he was known as a sober, Indus
trious workman and .while not an ex
pert carpenter was conscientious in U9
work. . }.-" â¢
He was also employed on the Granger
block.' J. C O'Neill, a stalrbullder. had
Lobb detailed as his assistant and en
deavored to teach him the business.
Their relations were pleasant until on
elecJon night. April 4, O'Neill met Lobb
on Fifth - street. Lobb addressed a foul
name. to O'Neill and followed it up with
a blow on O'Neill's Jaw. The next day,
O'Neill got out a warrant for Lobb's ar
rest and the latter, hearing of . the ac
i tlon. left San Diego before the warrant
could be served.
; Workmen generally considered that
Lobb was "slightly off" during the time
he was employed' at the, Granger build
ing. C. L. Schmucker was foreman ' and
Lobb bad told Schmucker that ' he t had
had trouble with O'Neill at . Fort Rose
crans. On April 4 O'Neill came up to
look * over the work on the block i and
Lobb confided to Mr. Schmucker. that no
knew O'Neill was there to spoil his work.
The next day he complained that O'Neill
had spoiled some window Joints, .. but
Schmucker could not see that anything
was wrong: That" night the trouble oc
curred.': Schmucker knew nothing of hiÂ»
Habits, but says that Lobb had not been
drinking ,when he acted so peculiarly on
the occasion of O'Neill's .visit.
Frcm remarks made by Lobb. at . dif
ferent times it is supposed his father jnm
a gamekeeper on an English \u25a0 preserve.
Lobb is thought to have been a former
member of the Canadian Mounted Polica
in the Northwest Territory. .. \u0084
When he was just outside the window
Uutchings fired a shot in the air and the
maniac peeped at him from behind the
li.cc curtain.
The squad in the corridor began to bat
ter ct the door. Suddenly the report of
the shotgun rang out again. A piece of
red dripping human skull flew through
the Tindow and, Hutchings. knowing well
what had happened, leaped into the room.
The men outside the door hearing the
repot t. thought Hutchings had -been
killed and began to fire through the door.
"Stop tiring, this is Hutchings," shouted
the policeman, and openedthe door.
One of Lobb's maddest freak's was
ufi:i? greenbacks as wads. In all he
must have 'shot" nearly $400 in currency at
the crowd. About J250 of this was ac
counted for by the police and Coroner's
deputies. Shortly after the insane* man
ended his life crowds {rathered in , front

literally itliot moaey an nell an leaden
death at the crowd, for he bud used
KTeenlcieK* in loadingr the shells used
by him.
These are some of the moot Import
ant features of one of the most excit
ing: traerdies that has ever racked the
nerven Â«Â»f the police or startled the
public of t hi* city. That the maniac
did cot succeed in bagging a policeman ,
Is inarvclcu*. t
For nearly an hour after his attempt
at wholesale murder the maniac held a
squad of policemen in command of Cap
tain Duke and Lieutenant Green at bay.
After the first shots from the maniac's
shotgun had crashed into the crowd on
Eddy street, people ran for coyer. Just
as Policeman Hiram Hutchings, who
fearlessly descended a fire escape just
outside the window, covered him with
a revolver, the maniac placed the muzzle
cf the shotgun against his temple and
pulled the trigger. The top of his head
was completely torn away.
>Ten Receive Wounds,
One Losing a?i Eye
Following is a list of the injured:
C. T. Chevalier, 123 Eddy street, shot
through the rlgrht eyeball and will lose
the sight In one eye; Vincent Itou
mante, 717 I-nrkln street, shot In the
face, shoulders and head; James Lari
bee, 923 V& Howard street, shot In the
eye, chin, cheek, arm, shoulder and
hip; Policeman Patrick Kissane, 28 Oak
Grove avenue, shot in check; \V. I).
. Coffman, 914 Howard street, shot In
cheek, ncse and forehead; \V. Jones,
IÂ«!2I Clay street, shot In face and head;
Kmil Roberts, 1517 Broderlck street,
\u25ba.hot In hand; George H. de I.anciun,
320 McAllister street, shot In the cheek,
band and arm; David Farrell, shot in
head; Witnc Qong Wo, 116 Eddy street,
shot In the hand.
With the usual cunning of the maniac,
Lobb had bolted the door before he start
ed the fusillade and had barricaded it
with th*^ mattress. Fourteen shots were
fired into the door by Policemen Patrick
Kissane and J. D. O'Connor, but the bul
*lcts were stopped by the mattress. Kis
sane pulled a sofa up to the door and
tried to get a pot shot at the maniac.
The instant the policeman's head showed
above the transom Lobb fired. A charge
of the duckshot crashed through Kis
sane's helmtt, tearing it to pieces, and
on* i^ellet iodged in his cheek.
Under orders from Captain Duke, Po
liceman Hutchings began to descend the
firfc escape, tie was ordered to fire a
shot into the air when he had reached a
point outside the maniac's window. Hold
ing.llls pistol in one hand, the fearless
policeman made the descent. He â¢:x
pectcd that Lofcb would see him at any
instant and turn the shotgun upon him.

called out, "Stop shooting. If s Hutch
ings." : , -'â¢â¢.. . \u25a0" . :
The brave policeman shoved aside the
bed and niattress that had been used as
a barricade and opened the door. Bare
foot and almost headless, the body of
Lobb lay upon the floor. A look at the
walls and ceiling. turned most of those
who entered faint and sick.' The place
was like a shambles.. ", '
The dead man -was \u25a0_ taken | to the
Morgue and his effects were taken in
charge by Public Administrator Hynes.
Lobb was an Englishman, 34 years of
age, and a carpenter; by trade. ";. He was
last employed in, San Diego. ; Hevwas a
member of the carpenters', union of that
city, in good standing, i Letters; found
in his tool chest | show^that Ihe had' a
sister, two brothers and parents in Eng
land. . v
\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 It is . thought that Lobb's murderous
fit of insanity :was brought on through
brooding over asimilarvtragedy in San
Diego.: About two* months 'ago W. J.
Stewart of that ; city, also a carpenter
and a memberof .Lobb's union, "ran
amuck ;in the - same J manner.,' Stewart
killed five and wounded: two before he
killed himself./ The similarity of 'the
cases convinces",the : police that : Lobb
was influenced by/ Stewart's insane
deed. Lobb j had been '< visiting ; at Ben

"All rights captain," said, Hutchings,
quietly. , "I'll take a chance." He: went
up to, the room; over Lobb's and began
the' perilous , descent. Outside- the- door
of the room where the maniac waited at
bay a"- squad; of 'policemen
eagerly for the* signal/ ; '
A pistoli shot rang^ out." An ':-' instant
later was J the ' crashing: report * of . (\u25a0 the
shotgun; Frantically .the \u25a0\u25a0- policemen
rushed at | the door.i believing; that their
comrade had been'shot and that'hls bat
tered ' body_ lay } on the pavement.f five
stories below. '
The ;door, would \u25a0\u25a0 not give. . though five
policemen shoved at : it with"; all i their
might. : The men began \u25a0 firing-; into \ it;

It was at this juncture that -Policeman
Hutchings showed himself a hero. .The
maniac was yelling triumphantly ... inside,
and it seemed ?as though . there j was no
way of getting at' hiarL -
Captain Duke, "who had .been; looking
through the., window of an \ adjoining
room, saw â¢ that Lobb's room , could \be
easily reached, by way of the fife
if any one .would dare, attempt it.* .
"Hutchings, climb down that â¢* ladder
and fire into the air,"; he ordered. "'"The
rest will rush; the' door." : â¢
But Kissane leaped .to his feet with a
laugh, and the two officers emptied their
revolvers through the door, hoping to : hit
the maniac with a chance shot. An
other roar of the shotgun convince*.
them that Lobb had not been hit
Hutchings Performs
A Feat of Bravery
. "I'm going to get him," said Kissane.
He mounted a sofa and tried to peer over
the transom. A deafening report rang
out, and he staggered back. Hi's face
was bleeding profusely where a pellet
from the shotgun had struck him, and
O'Connor, thinking he had been badly
wounded, tried to drag him away, from
the door.
Kissane and J. C. O'Connor rushed at
the door of the maniac's room, but it
held fast, and a shot through the tran
som warned them that the man inside
was on the alert.' .
It i 3 fortunate that the maniac did not
have a rifle instead of a shotgun. Had
he fired but three shots with a rifle he
would perhaps have killed or mortally
wounded at least three people.
The gun used was a 12-bore shotgun,
and the shells were loaded with No. 4
shot, the kind usually, used in duck
shooting.
Policeman Percy Smith heard the first
shots, and rushing up to Lobb's room de
manded his surrender. The maniac's
reply was a shot through the transom.
The Central Police Station was immedi
ately notified, and Policemen Kissane, J.
C. O'Connor, J. . B. O'Connor, J. J. Till
man, Prowse and Wratton were rushed
to the scene, in command of Captain
Duke and Lieutenant Green.
Three rifles were brought along. It
was at first Captain Duke's intention to'
station marksmen on the roofs opposite
to pick off the maniac, but this was
found impracticable, as the other build
ings were lower than the room occupied
by Lobb.
When Wong Qung Wo, a Chinese^ em
ployed in a store across the street,
stepped out to "look see," Lobb fired at
him with a pistol. His aim was accu
rate, for the Chinaman was wounded in
the hand. .
Lobb went to the hotel Tuesday night
and hired the room, it is thought, for
the purpose of doing wholesale murder.
He brought with him a twelve-bore shot
gun, over fifty cartridges and a 32-caliber
pistol.
Begins Shooting at
Crowd From Window
Emile Carpenter, the bellboy who
showed him to the room, noticed that he
was acting rather queerly. When asked
whether he was satisfied with the room
he looked under the bed and inspected
the place carefully. Then he laid a pack
age of strawberry tarts he had brought
with him upon the bureau and paid for
the room.
Shortly after. 7 o'clock in the morning
Lobb went to the window and hurled a
chair down to the street. A wash basin
and a marble-topped table crashed after
it. Another chair caught in a skein of
tele graph wires. - .
.Â» crowd congregated in front of the
hcttl to watch the antics of the madman.
Lobb stepped aside .rom the window.
When he reappeared he held" a. shotgun
and fired into the frightened crowd. W.
D. Coffman. James Laribee, C. T. Chev
alier and Emil Roberts, a boy, were
wounded at the first shot. Before the
terrificd ' spectators could move, -Lobb"
fired the second barrel. Vincent Rou
mante. W. Jones and David Farrell were
struck by the scattering charge. Lobb
quickly reloaded and fired again at the
fleeing crowd. George H. de Longton,
was struck.

PRESIDENT TAKES UP NEW TASK.
Kndeavnrlng to Arrnngre an Armistice
Between the Belligerents.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 2Lâ President
Roosevelt evidently has taken a new and
important step in the negotiations be
tween the belligerents. . While there are
collateral reasons for believing ; that it
relates to an armistice which will pre
vent the impending battle in Manchuria,
this. cannot be positively affirmed.
Embassador Meyer went suddenly to
the St Petersburg Foreign Office late
last night and had an Interview with
Foreign Minister Lamsdorff, at which; it
Is believed, . the Embassador communi
cated an important message from.Presi
dent Roosevelt, but neither at the For
eign Office nor at the American -Embassy
is the slightest light thrown on what
transpired. From the extreme secrecy
observed the matter, beyond doubt, is
one of the greatest delicacy. As the
statement Is vouchsafed at "the Foreign
Office that the negotiations are proceed
ing without a hitch, the inference fol
lows that'll relates to a new phase, in
which the' President has again taken the
'initiative. \u25a0* \u25a0 - \u25a0 â¢â¢ ' '

With- regard to the Mercado claim
Bowen gives the text- of a letter which
was among the papers he found 'in thÂ«
lefatlon archives. This letter Is ad
dressed tow; W. Russell.- and says:
The statement that I attempted to 'steal or
otherwise improperly, procure information is
unwarranted. I made Use of coondentlal agents
ooly and of oÂ«r consular officers in Venezuela \u25a0
The State Department \u25a0 on at 'least two occa
sions provided me *Ith money to procure
secret Information. - Â»
Bowen says he regards his offer ' of a
promotion as an attempt to bribe him.
He adds:
After referring to the appearance of
thÂ« Loomis charges in several papers,
Bowen says:
To say that 1 instigated these charges is tha
pnrtaet of a heated Imagination.
w_ lt ?*% rt *H> * fter tW " that l WM summoned
by the State Department to Washington and a
departmental Inquiry was made Into Mr
Loomis 1 conduct In Venezuela and I was dis
missed from the diplomatic service. Tet I am
neither responsiaU for Mr. Loomis' unsavory
reputation in Caracas nor for the circulation
of scandalous reports about him. He estab
lished thÂ« reputation himself while living there
as American Minister from 1W to April 1&01.
and the statements charging him. wlth-dlÂ»
hoBest and dishonorable' conduct were made"
with such detail of circumstances that mere
denial by me was ueelers. What was needed
was not thf!r denial, but their disproof I
admit that after I found. In February. IOOt,
In the legation archive*, the documents that- 1 :
\u25a0transmitted to the State Department in Wash- ;
tngten 1 believed Mr. Loomis to be t dishonest
man. I admit that after I received no ex
planation of these documents and no further
investigation was made, thoiyrh I reported the
ccandal to be *tlll current -in Caracas and
most tmbarrarttng to the Interests â¢of the
United States, .my belief Jn'iMr. Loomis' dis
honesty was not diminished. ;â â¢ .
ALLEGES ATTEMPT AT BRIBERY;
Bowen says that the recent depart
mental inquiry should not prevent "an
open, impartial, fearkss and thorough
investigation into all the facts."
"Suppression of truth will never estab
lish ti." he adds. "Tolerance of evil
will never crush it. No officer, however
high, should shelter a wrongdoer."
RUMORS RIFE IS CARACAS.
When he went to Venezuela as suc
cessor to Loomis, Bowen declares, he
found current rumors 6erlously affecting
the honor and integrity of his predeces
sor, both as a man and as a representa
tire of the United Government.
Bowen says that, feeling a sense of pride ,
in representing the United States, these
rumors were a source of continual morti
fication to him. Epitomizing the rumors,
Bowen says:
Mr. Loomis, while MlnUter. was reported
to have used his public position to fill his pri
vate purse by obtaining interest* In conces
sion* and in various claims agrainst the Venez
uelan Government. He was commonly thought,
al*o, to have been in the pay of thÂ« Bmnudez
Asphalt Company and to have made use of hi*
own official position to give color â¢to the be
lief that the United. Bute* Government was
especially favorable to the contention of that
company In its controversy with the Venezue
lan. Government. I had no means of refuting
th*aÂ« â¢eaadaloua statements. Their . cubel&n
tial truth was assumed by my diplomatic col
leagues, as well as by the general public at
Caracas.
Referring to the documents left by his
predecessor In the legation at Caracas
and forwarded by Bowen to the State
Department, the latter says:
I cannot better express my own feelings In
regard to their contents than in the words of
the Secretary of State, who, in his letter ac
knowledging their receipt, said: "I have. been
grÂ«s.tly surprleed and pained in reaflinr the
documents you sent me."
OFFERED A PROMOTION*.
Bowen tells of having sent to the State
Department Information of the report
cm I cut in Caracas "that an Incriminat
ing check to Loomis and a letter from
him to the Governmental custodian of the .
asphalt property, promising that the
United States would not Intervene in
Venezuela, were In the hands of one of
President Caetro'e friends." He con
tinues: ':-y~s,~J?ti?
Chart)? afterward I received a cable from
the State Department, offering: to me the :
position which was Intended to be a stepping
stone to an Emcaoaadorship. It seemed to me
that, under the circumstances, my duty to the
United States demanded that I should stay,
for the present at least. In Caracas, and I de
clined the oCer, personally advantageous as It '
was to znyself.
Currently with the report In Caracas that
President Oartro had possession of documents
directly Incriminating the First Assistant Sec
retary of Statt, President Castro dispatched
a general agent to Washington. Concurrently
with my refusal to leave my post at Caracas
ther* began to appear from Washington wich
ftlfe and misleading statements In our papers
as "Bowen has asked to be recalled; he wants
to sÂ«ver diplomatic relations with Venezuela:
he advises that a n&vtj demonstration may
be made Immediately in Venezuelan waters: he
U at rworfls' points with Castro." False re
ports of this sort are ordinarily contradicted
by thÂ« Department of State. la this instance
they wÂ«re not. Any onÂ« at all f ami! tar with
diplomatic relations with Venezuela wUI un
derstand without further explanation tha mani
fold embarrassments of such a, ' situation.
"I admit," he declared, "that I regard
ed the offer as an attempt to bribe me,
veiled under the offer of a higher position
aad Inspired by Loomis. I make no doubt
that, in the course of the recent inquiry,
it has been sufficiently plain that I did
not think that Loomis was an > honest
man and that I did not believe hi* -con
duct as .Minister to Venezuela bad been
honorable."
NEW YORK. June 2Lâ Herbert W.
Bowen, formerly Minister to Venezuela.
to-day made public a long statement in
reply to President Roosevelt's letter dis
missing him from the diplomatic service,
&s a result of the investigation made by
Secretary Taft into the controversy be
tween Bowen and Francis B. Loomis,
First Assistant Secretary of State.
Bowen declares that the "Venezuelan
scandal constitutes a national disgrace."
He asserts that "the Loomis scandal"
pervaded- Caracas and constantly "grew
wors* &nd worse." Bowen says that short
ly after he called the matter to the at
tention of the Department of State he re
ceived a cable o2er from Washington of
diplomatic promotion that would remove
him from Caracas.

After Shairp Resistance.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 22.â The public,
which has no idea that negotiations for
an armistice are on foot, believes that a
great battle in Manchuria is now begin-,
nlng. and official dispatches from both'
sides bear out the idea that the Japan
ese hayÂ« commenced their main advance,
though as yet there have been no heavy
collisions.
The Japanese, following the .checking
of the movement to the west, are now
pushing forward in force along the rail
road. ' and the Mandarin and Mainaikai
roads, their â¢ front stretching from Slng
lungchuan. fifteen miles north of Chang
tufu. and east through Shuanmiaotzu sta-'
tlon to Yaoma Pass oh the Mandarin
road.
The Russians evacuated the advanced
positions after sharp resistance and are
evidently retiring to their first line of en
trenchments, which Is believed to cross
the railroad at Slpinghai, fourteen miles
farther north. They have a number, of
other fortified positions before reaching
their ultimate line of â¢ defense at Klrin
and at Changchunfu, eighty miles-in the
rear.
Lieutenant General Linevitch' evidently
has Imposed an embargo on: press mes

Opp. Hafe'a 'â¢- Ban Franeliea, CaLFrawley Is probably one of the best
representatives on the stage of the
manly young American.- and it Is easy
to believe that In his impersonation. of
Ranson he will I win approving praise
and In no small degree add to the popu
larity he has already won. The story of
the young lieutenant -who, as a joke,
holds up a stage- with nothing more
harmful than a pair of shears, r3 replete
with vital dramatic interest, and when
to this is added a boy and girl romance,
such as that of Ranson and Mary, the
combination affords a wholesome and
pleasant entertainment. . . . . . .

Of James H. Hyde's directorates in vari
ous corporations, Hendricks expresses the
opinion that he was "put on these boards
for the reason that he .was the financial
head - of . a great ' insurance -corporation,
whose I assets â¢ were sso | large and whose
ready money was always . available for
the . purchase of securities . which these
great. 'corporations are largely In the
market to sell."
-The pension of $25,000 to Mrs. Henry B.
Hyde Is condemned as unnecessary and
probably Illegal.
- Of the directors Mr. Hendricks found
that only ten of the fifty-two owned
stock in their own right, and most of the
others - qualified on Hyde stock.
"H. C. -Frick Is the . only man," says
Hendricks, : "who, on the record, is not
under obligations to Mr.' Hyde, and he
qualified | by Hyde stock."

been accustomed to draw large sums for

that :he - assumed domination of the so
ciety's affairs until the presidency was
reduced to a. position of secondary im
portance, and that he proceeded to use

as if>they/were his own; until he was

year, driving many, worklngmen out of
the city and causing some manufactur

Btetdily falling rain drenched the festal
draplngs of the city to-day and disap
pointed the people of Worcester, but de
tracted not at all from the enthusiastic
reception which was given President
Roosevelt upon the occasion of his visit
to Clark University and Holy Cross CoX

cordiality of the people by riding through
the streets of the city in an open carriage
end much of the time with head bared.
The President delivered addresses both
at Holy Cross and Clark University and
the former institution conferred upon him
the honorary degree of LL.D. At Clark
University the President took occasion
to pay a tribute to Carroll D. Wright,
president cf the college, as well as to the
late United States Senator George I F.

large body of people on the athletic field.

which acts of coercion would entail. A union
into which' Norway would be . forced In such
a manner would be of lrttle value to Sweden.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Strange stories are being sent in from
thÂ« country districts regarding the dep
redations of these hordes of "hoppers,"
narratives of their work including :ac
| counts of clothes on j clothes lines eaten
up. Professor Woodworth, . Instead of
i doubting these strange reports, confirms
them, saying to-day that the half has
net bÂ«en told of the terrible work.
"Three yeais ago these grasshoppers
actually ate the letters off tomb
stones In Roseville," said Professor
Woodwortb, the entomological expert of
; the Agricuituial College. "That sounds
like a Baron Munchausen story, but it. is
true. It should be said perhaps that. the
tombstones were made of wood, but even
at that the destructiveness of the insects
was extraordinary. They will eat any
thing in their path .Into., which they can
set their teeth, and growing crops they
simply sweep out of the way." v
The present plague of grasshoppers is
declared by Professor Woodworth to be
the woist in California since 1355, -< when
the insects wrought the greatest havoc
in agricultural districts recorded in the
Stale's history. In that year the papers
chronicltd the complete destruction of
nearly every,; Crop.
The loss to the farmers then amounted
to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Professor Woodworth, describing the
methods he and his helpers will use in
their campaign, which Is now to be com
menced, says that the plans will vary
according to the age of the insects that
are to be exterminated. When they are
young and unable to fly burning is the
most effective plan. It is often the case,
however, that in that stage of growth
the vegetation upon which they are
feeding is too green to burn. Plowing-in
is resorted to in other instances and at
other stages a poisonous mixture,*"in
cluding arsenic, bran and .molasses.-Jla*
used and the pests perish In large num
bers when this is spread in their path."
BERKELEY, June 21.â 1n response to
urgent entreaties for help from the farm
ers of California who are suffering from
the greatest plague of grasshoppers that
has visited the State In forty years; Pro
fessor C. M. Woodworth left the uni
versity to-day to begin a campaign
against the destructive pest..' â¢ \u25a0\u25a0
Professor Woodworth will go first to
Natoma in Sacramento County and then
to Corning in Tehama County, where the
grasshoppers are now raging In such
numbeis as to endanger all of the crops
in their path. Krom these points the
university scientist will travel to other
arillctt d districts and systematically wage
war.
When the president had concluded At
torney WV R. Davis made an address
strongly favoring the project. ' f ,
Af ttfr Attorney Davis '. had completed
his talk E. A. Bushel! asked \u25a0 if the
project included the building of. a new
City Hall. â¢ v \u25a0
President Abrahamson replied that was
entirely within the province' of the City
Council, but that the opening of Wash
ington "street would be the first step in
the ! direction of a new City Hall. "
The meeting adjourned subject to the
call of the chair. . \u0084:
The Public Improvement Committee of
the- City ; Council to-night listened to
speeches from Washington street mer
chants on the' opening project.; Mayor
Mott spoke, saying he believed the open
ing of the street to be a commercial ne
cessity, but he was not in favor of build
ing a new City-Hall on the present; site,
or the plaza. He suggested that a new
site might be acquired.but that the pub
lic should have ample opportunity to dis
cuss the project in all of its phases.

HOUNDS WILL RUN ONE DAY
AT UNION COURSING PARK
The two crack Chicago bowlers.
Bteele and Brill, appeared in this city
at the Columbia alleys last night for
the first time. They met Shave and
llcMuilen, the local crackerjacks, in
a match game and had little difflculty
in getting away with the honors. The
Chicago men* rolled up 2005 pins in
five games, while the home players
made 1925. The Chicago men won by
ii' pins.
Tne exhibition match was to have
consisted of seven games, victory to
rest with the team scoring: the best
four out of the total. The Windy
City men relied up four out of five,
ana that ended the exhibition before
Shave and McMullen could get into the
going.
The Chicago experts rolled a good,
FtendV jrame . throughout and showed
their superiority 04'er their opponents
in every branch, especially In steadi
ness at critical moments. They "took
the first two games, but the locals
fhovred a burst of speed and took the
third by a score of 357 to 319. This
grave the large crowd of rooters hope,
but It was all dashed when tne- Chicago
cracks waded in and romped away
with the next two games without
turning a hair.
Steele and Brill are traveling over
the country playing match games
with the leading exponents of the
pastime in all the large cities. They
will meet Fred May and Pete Bertlesen
to-morrow night on the San Francisco
allej-s. Following is the score of last

Uncle's baseball brigade is going to
grab that .banner of glory away .from
the Tigers unless some of the stars drop
dead or pull up lame 'while coming in
with runs. Yesterday was the occasion
for the s Seals' sixth triumph without a
setback and the Angels were again vic
timized by but one little run. Score-
San Francisco 2, Los Angeles 1. .
Joe Nealon was the man behind the
bingler that made the Angels losers
again. " It happened to be a two-cushion'
Ewipe far out against the " center field
fence that left no doubt behind it. Hllde
brand had started the Inning with a hit
to right and Irwin managed to lay down
a pretty bunt. Nealon did the rest.
Charley Baum cannot sidestep that
hoodoo of bis that comes bobbing up
every time he Is due to pitch., Charley"
has dropped nearly all i his games this
season by one run. He would , have
dropped yesterday's at Recreation Park
without a run or a' hit but for his own
valiant efforts with, the timber. He
scored the only Angel run and made both
hits.
Baum started .the run-getting In the
sixth with a two-cushion wallop over
Waldron's head. Whalen booted Ber
nard's bunt and matters looked bad.
Flood then flew to short and Smith
bingled' a grounder to the same place.
Bernard was retired at second ' while
Baum came scampering In. Bernard in
terfered with Wheeler's return of the
ball to the plate, but Umpire Davis al
lowed the run to score..
The Seals came right back with an
other in their half of the same spasm.
Wheeler opened with a drive to left, ad
vancing on Hllde'e bunt. Irwin unloaded
a slow one to Brashear, sending Wheeler
along the line to third. Wheeler and Ir
win started out on a double steal.
Georgie got away with his all right, but
\ Charles was run down and copped be
tween first and second by Dillon.
The deadlock prevailed till Joe Nealon
soused the ball at the right ; time In the
ninth spasm. The Angels never had a
license for a look-in outside the sixth
inning, for -Jimmy the Whale had his
high one working about right toward the
end of the fight. The scorer-

CINCINNATI. June 2Lâ The steeple
chase handicap was the feature to-day at
Latonia track. â¢ Belle Dodson, which fin
ished first, bumped into Varner after go-
Ing over the last Jump. Jockey Dupee,
who had the mount on the latter, claimed
a . foul, which was allowed by Judge
Francis Trevelyan. On the way to the
Jockey room Archibald, who rode Belle
Dodson, struck Dupee. Archibald was
later ruled off the turf for life by the
Judges.

SEATTLE. June 21.â Aside from *
general complaint at the cinch methods
| employed by the association and syndi
l cate books at The Meadows, the feature
!of to-day's racing was the -slx-fur
flong event, in which Laura F. M.
spread-eagled her field. She was im
mediately run up by A. Neal. owner of :
My Surprise, from 3300 to $300, but was
retained by her owner. Following this
the owner of Doublet claimed My Sur
prise for 5550.
I Eleven Bells, the odds-on choice In
the seven furlongs, was defeated by
Metlakatla by a nose with TVager
I third, three lengths behind. In the four
and a half furlong event Trapshooter
a sixteen to flve shot, beat Toltec, tho
favorite, at eight to flve. by three and
a half lengths. That racing at The
Meadows is being killed by the Kln~

with the bookies is the generally ex
pressed sentiment. The attendance to-"

PORTLAND. June TLâ After a weari
some and dangerous 4000 mile automobile
trip across the American continent. Huss
and Wigle, riding "Old Scout." entered
Portland at 1 o'clock to-day, winner of
the automobile race against "Old Steady,"
whose chauffeur, Megargel, Is some
where In Eastern Oregon, hurrying
toward Portland.
Just forty-four days ago "Old Scout"
Â«.n<S "Old Steady" left New York to race
across the continent with the object of
attending, if possible, the opening ses
e!oh of the National Good Roads Conven
tion, which convened to-day at the Lewis
and Clark Exposition grounds. Huss.
with "Old Scout," arrived on schedule
time, presenting the letter of greeting
of Melville E. Stone, general manager of
the Associated Press, to President Goode
of the exposition Just as the convention
was called to order.
The race across the continent was a re
markable one. The machines and the
drivers endured great hardship*, meeting
â¢with accidents and obstacles without
number. Roads constructed under the
direction of engineers were skimmed over
8t wonderful speed In some sections of
the country. In other sections It took
entire days to go over a few miles of un
cared for and poorly constructed high
way.
The delegates to the Good Roads Con
vention believe tfce race between "Old
Scout" and "Old Steady" will have a
great effect in the missionary work nec
essary to put the roads In all sections
of the country In passable condition.

PORTLAND, Or., June 21.â For the first
time on the Pacific Coast and, it Is be
lieved, the third instance in the history
of professional baseball, an unassisted
triple play was made to-day by Schlafley,
Portland's second baseman, In the first
Inning of the game with Seattle. With
Russ Hall, Seattle's ehortshop, at second
and Walters, the Seattle center fielder, at,
first. First Baseman Kemjner made what
appeared to be a low outfield hit. Â»It
failed to carry, and was brought down by
Schlafley.
In the meantime both Walters and Hall
had started to run. Schlafley touched the
second base, retiring Hall and then unas
sisted caught Walters and touched him
with the ballbefore he could return to
first base. The quickness of the play sur
prised the spectators. Both French and
Roach pitched good ball, but bunched hits
in the eighth turned the tide in the home
team'p favor. Score:
.'* Three favorites out of six won for the
form players to-day at the track. A
much better attendance was recorded.
Only six books were in operation, but
these were almost swamped with busi
ness. Summary: . . /

than any other to wreck, ruin and \u25a0\u0084 â¢ , J^xiJuFlx
humiliate life, is Contagious Blood Poison^ Sorrow, shame and suffering go
hand in hand with this great enemj-, and man has always hated and fought
it as he has no other disease. It is the most powerful of all poisons; no mat-
ter how pure the blood may be, when its virus enters, the entire circulation
becomes poisoned and its chain of horrible symptoms-begin to show. Usu-
ally the first sign is a small sore or ulcer, not at all alarming in appearance,
but the blood is being saturated with the deadly poison; and soon the mouth
and throat begin to ulcerate, the hair and eyebrows drop out, a red eruption
breaks out on the body, copper-colored splotches and Â«ores make .their^
appearance and the poison even works down into ; the bones and
the nerves. Not only is the disease hereditary, being transmitted from
parent, to child, in the form of scrofula, weak eyes, soft bones, weakV puny
constitutions, etc., but is also so highly contagious that many" a; life; has
been ruined by a friendly hand shake, or from using the toilet articles of
one infected with the poison. To cure this blighting, -deadly* curse 1 the*

the other barbers as they crowded
about: Phelan.
John ; J. Phelan, ; who at present
guides a razor. f and \ shears in the bar- |
ber-shop at 2l"' .Spruce street, had the !
honor of clipping ! the hairof: the \ mil- ;
lion air c Sunday-school' teacher last De- j
cember, and because of the; great care J
he took John D. Rockefeller Jr.' tipped i
him. This is said to be. the only * Up I
the young man ever." gave to:a. barber.-
Phelan was formerly employed \u25a0; in a
barber-shop in the - Standard Oil build-*
ing at 26 Broadway! John D. Rockefel
ler Jr. was a customer of the place,
but he ' always : waited fforr r a certain
barber to c|it his hair.
Butthe lucky day came for Phelan
when all the men in \ the establishment j
were removing whiskers and;: beards
and the Sunday-school teacher came in.
He was in a tremendous hurry, as he
intended sailing for England and had
only a few minutes to catch the
steamer.
"You're next!" shouted Phelan anx
iously. . .
Rockefeller climbed into the. chair
and asked him to trim his hair quickly.
Ho explained the cause of his haste,
and Phelan "got busy" and removed the
uneven ends of the millionaire's hair
in a surprisingly, short time. .'" -
"Good work!" said John. D. Jr.. as
he felt in his trousers pocket for
change. "Take this," and he handed*
Phelan -a coin.
EXTRAVAGANCE was never [ one . : of
John, D. Rockefeller Jr.'s : bad
traits. . Nevertheless, a barber, who
cut auburn" locks recently \u25a0 is in
possession of a piece of evidence [that
would indicateHhat the "oil, king's" son
is not parsimonious, says the' New
YorksWorld. ;,% :c: c ; ' l- : >'.-. '/J - ".:':''

Trig and trim are" the lines which" the. shirt waists intended for
. wear with the" smart tailor-mades of . the summer time display.. Plain
and close fitting lines prevail, and both cut and fit must be faultless if
the'eorrect effect:is to be attained. < The shirt waisA" illustrated is one
of the round thread, German linens; with little apple Blossom sprays em
- broidered in flat effect, with plain white linen thread. The shoulder seam
is broad/ the sleeve somewhat fuller .at the top than ; the regulation
shirt pattern; -and collar, cuff; and front pleat are embroidered with
scalloped' edges that ; make for a very pretty finish. The closeness of
the fit makes the use of a dress shield desirable. V

THE -willingness to chance it is. to a
certain extent a factor in . success,
writes G. R. Clarke in the Chicago
Tribune. There are numberless cases in
which the giving up of a sure thing to
follow the path of .difficult "uncertainties
has proved the entrance to the road to
wealth.' '
The willingness to take chances, how
ever, is not always the reckless course
and challenge to,: fate that it appears
to be. J Instead .it is a putting of the
known forces within against the unknown
ones without. It is a careful reckoning
of the strength of desire, ambition and
determination, and putting them in their
place as a factor against difficulty.
"Chopping's pretty sure, Jim," \u25a0 said the
brother of Hill, -,the, railroad magnate,
when f he detAdedto.^rsake-ihis. life as a
woodman^ and -start, out west. , ,-.
"I'm going to take my chance and give
it up, just the same," . said young ; Hill.
Though he could not see the future,
events since , leave , ho . room 'for ' doubt
that the young man ! took a sweeping i in
ventory of his energies before he made
this answer. \
CARNEGIE! TOOK LONG CHANCE.
When as a small -boy,. Andrew Car
negie got a chance to leave the
factory, it was to take the responsi
bility of running a large engine, an art
of which . he knew nothing. He did not
refuse his opportunity on this account,
but took the chance of making good by
his own exertions afterward. . * ,
"The firing of the boiler, was all right,"
says Mr. Carnegie, in his autobiography,
"for, fortunately, we' did not" use coal,
but wooden chips. But the. responsibil
ity of keeping the . water right, running
the engine, and the fear of making a mis
take, caused too great a i strain and I
awoke often to find myself Bitting up in
bed trying the gauges."
"He never told them at. home what a
tussle he was having," says one of Mr.
Carnegie's biographers, who sees in this
story the key to. his: success. "It is the
revelation of his whoie; character. He
never hesitated to \u25a0- take fa chance when
promotion was In sight. He' did not wait
until he; had mastered an occupation or
situation before accepting j It. ' He accept
ed it first and then mastered it. He was
an engineer before he : knew anything
about boilers, to say ' nothing . of , engines.
The same is due of the successive duties
which Ihe assumed."
CARNEGIE 'AND PITTSBrRG.
The way Mr. Carnegie ? planned to j use
what resources he possessed when he was
offered the position, of j messenger boy, he
tells again in his ' autobiography. :
4'My only dread," he says, .'-'was that I
should some i day be ' dismissed . because < I
did not;know the^city,~ for* it /was? neces
sary that " a messenger ; should '] know the
names V and addresses of '1 those men ;-;\u25a0; in
Pittsburg who; were : in the j habit s^of v re
ceiving many \u25a0-* messages, and , I .was if a
stranger . In the -city. ; - However, - s I , made
up my; mind; that 51 ' would learn tor re
peat successively 1 ' each X business j house > In
the I principal streets.r and i was ;' soon able ;
to shut my eyes : and begin " at [ one side ]of
Wood i street and (call every ; firm ' success
ively f to ' the : top;, and pass j to : the * other
side and ;call â¢ every J firm- to the ?" bottom. 1
Before long I > was - able "" to ; do , \u25a0 this \u25a0' with
the - business; streets t generally."]' 'i> "- "\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0:- ;
A more recent instance of the ability to
take chances '\u25a0. the , greatness of which - was j
only \u25a0 equaled . by his . boundless j determina
tion â was '"i shown \u25a0{ In '; the^ encounter- which
young ; Mr. Heinze' had a' few ; years ? ago
with the :' Standard Oil L Company.': ~ ; \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢
" : " : HEINZE'S j,-' COPPER I FlGHT. ';'"; '_'. .
Heinze .' Â«nade \u25a0Â» the i'clalm i that . he ; ebuid
follow the course of a copper claim which
he held and which lay^ bet ween, two other
mines; : so . that ') he could' trace .the -dip ; of
his "own ivein-^ even* where 1 it\ went into
the others. % The^men in ; /charge? of \u25a0; the
other ] properties ; laughed at* the idea. He
went". into; the v courts, \u25a0;_ brought', suit and
succeeded {In I: getting enough
to tle7up the work < of the two* great mines/
Â« ; ; So'; embarrassed -;wereÂ»the> operations! at
the' other 4 mines downed -by; Standard j^Oll
that 1 they thought it 3 worth ' while , to i com
promise. 1 So' Mr. ; Rogers 'sent . for :'Mr."
Heinze. "The young man came and the
two went into consultation.
"Now, Mr. Heinze," said Mr. Rogers,
"you know that \u25a0we can ruin : you. : If we
carry this thing to the end we can strip
you of all you. have. But Jwe have some
plans which are interfered with by these
suits, and I have sent for j you to talk
business with you." \ \
: r"I am always ready to listen to a busi
ness proposition,"" was the young. man's
answer.
CALMLY ASKS, FOR $10,000,000.
"How much do youwant to quit?"
The young man smiled. "I did not
come .here \u25a0to make . a proposition, â¢ Mr.
Rogers. You \ sent : for me, you know. I
am here to 'listen to you." ; ,-'
"We will give you $250,000 cash to settle
all your claims. ; We â¢ will ; give it to ,you
this afternoon,"he added impressively.
f The" young - man looked at the , older
man with a smile. "I^thought you were
a man of .broad "views and used to 'great
j negotiations,'. 1 Jhe said.: \u25a0 ' : s â¢ :
V "In the name of heaven, how much do
you want ?" , was | the answer. . â¢
"Ten' million dollars," said Heinze.,
That the young ; man ,; had ,at least a
good idea of the 'difficulties which lay t
i before hlmvwhen he 'refused' the 'OftTer to
name his. price, cannot s be doubted. That
he. made_- no mistake Jn, measuring.; his
own fighting, qualities as /able to cope
with them was proved" a > little over a
year ago, ;: when, ; after endless suits," a
decision was 'granted - in, the Montana
courts which /practically \u25a0'.\u25a0 gave him the
victory - over the - great â¢ company, he â¢ had
been fighting. : It also turned the Minnie
Healy mine .over; to him, worth, it # wa3
estimated, .just $10,000,000. ..

â¢*â¢ his vindication against the charges of Minister Bbwen. Mr.
. Loomis was Minister to Venezuela in the trying time that preceded
the exhaustion of the world's patience with the dictator Castro'
Loomis was firm in his assertion of American rights and in insist;
ing that Castro should treat the nationals of other countries fairly?
For this he incurred the wrath of the Monkey of theXAndes, and
'was transferred first to the Portuguese mission and, when Dr. Hill
was sent as Minister to Switzerland, was appointed' First Assistant
Secretary of State. A

of Secretary Hay, Mr. Loomis" has conducted himself with great'
prudence and address, disposing, .wisely of all the delicate matters i
of international intercourse that came to the department. Of course'
it was infuriating to Castro that his enemy was in a position of such
power and dignity, and he immediatelybegan;using v Minister: Boweri
as a tool to break Loomis. Bowen was a willing instalment. Since'
he was permitted to represent Venezuela at The Hague court; in
the arbitration following the, blockade of that country; he. has .been
bad!y swollen with a sense of his vast importance in .the; diplomatic
world. The State Department seemedan affair too small for hit*
: consideration, and he went so far as to issue his own "Red .Book":
on the Venezuela affair, ignoring the department entirely. His
ideas of propriety may be judged by his sendingfariofficiaf letter to
Secretary Taft, and addressing him as "Dear Bill.",
Upon investigation his case against Secretary Loomis proved
to have no foundation except in his malevolence" and ttiat -of : Castro:
The' President has vindicated Loomis and dismissed Bowers a fate
which he earned. His days of "Dear Billing" are over and hetwill
have leisure in which to shrink to his normal girth. Castro has hot
improved his position by his part in this nefarious intrigue, as he
will doubtless learn later on. Americans are satisfied; that justice

THE LITTLE 'UNS
SENATOR MILLARD of Nebraska, a member of the Senate
Committee which has the matter in charge, is quoted, to the
effect that the committee will favor and'further the legislation
agked for by the President, enlarging the powers of the Interstate
Gommerce Commission. Prior to this statement ther.e was -no evi
dence before the country that the committee intended to do anything
ejse. That part of the press which makes politics out of peanuts has
been encouraging public ownership advocates by, assuming what the.
committee would or would not do, but it has air been assumption.
The committee probably shares the President's idea that the. Gov
ernment was created to* govern, and to curb only such persons and
business policies as are inimical to the common interest. It is to do
this by exercising the powers of government, and not by entering
into business in competition with its own citizens.
Senator Millard's statement is' reassuring to those who believe
that the Government should govern. It will not be as favorably,
received by those who think Government is a failure, and must
change itself and its purpose by going into business on a scale so
large as to make individual effort impossible. Some of the railroads
of the country have done their best to- help along the latter class.
They have entirely confused the public mind in relation to the con
trol of railroad rates as suggested by the President. So it has come
to pass that a great many people believe that he wants power con
ferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to make every
interstate freight rate in the country. As the rates so fixed would
\u25a0have to be equal, the fear has been raised that long haul shippers
would suffer by abolition of- the differential provided for in the
fourth clause of the interstate commerce law.
By avoiding any attack upon what the President does want,
and by very earnest and well advertised criticism of what he does
not want, some of the corporations have completed the confusion
of the public mind. What he does want is so reasonable and proper
that there should be no objection to it, and there can be none that
is founded in good reason or good policy. All of the President's
idea is expressed in this brief extract from his message : "The In
terstate Commerce Commission should be vested with the power,
when a given rate has been challenged and after full hearing found
to be unreasonable, to decide, subject to judicial review, what shall
be a reasonable rate to take its place; the ruling of the commission
to take effect immediately and to obtain, unless and until it is re
versed by the court of review."
That plan is not untried. It was followed by the earliest and
most successful State railroad commissions. Those bodies, admin
istrative in their legal aspect, by trying causes brought to them
through the challenge of a rate fixed by a railroad, became in their
essence judicial bodies. Prior to their creation State Legislatures
had attempted to enact rate schedules, which proved to be impracti
cable and in restraint of trade.
The decision of the Supreme Court that authority exists to
replace an unreasonable by a reasonable rate has been widely mis
understood. It has been taken to mean to be the old and impossible
plan of enacting rates into law. This is not at all so. The court means
that public authority over rates, a function of government, must be
legislative in its origin. This is well understood by the President,
who desires legislation to empower the Interstate Commerce Com
mission to judicially examine a rate that has been challenged and,
if found unreasonable, to immediately put a reasonable rate in its
place. Then the courts are open to an appeal by the corporation
affected. The real point is in putting the reasonable rate in imme
diate operation. Heretofore its operation could be held in abeyance
pending the law's delay in the courts and shippers had no relief; at
all. but had to go on paying the unreasonable rate while enduring
the expense of litigation.
While there is no statement covering the point, we assume : that
under the policy advocated by the President, the Government,
through the Department of Justice, will assume the burden of vin
dicating the act of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the
courts. This will mean that the individual citizen, seeking the ben
efit of the law, will not have to endure the cost of following an
appeal. In other words, the Government will, by this legislation,
impose its power between the shipper and the railroad, in the exer
cise of a purely governmental function.
This explanation is necessary to a good understanding of just
what the President proposes. It is the projection of Government
into the transportation policy of the country, in order to govern the
corporations, not to supplant or substitute them. Between this and
the abdication of the Government and the abandonment of its
functions, in order to control the situation by going, into business
itself, there is a great gulf. The two propositions are wide apart
as the poles. Socialism wants the Government to cease governing
and go into business. The President wants it. to govern, and leave
business to individual energy and enterprise.

PARIS. Jun* 1.
/rV^Nja spring r or summer afternoon the beautiful suburb of Paris wqicn _. is
l/Â«l l /knowp as St. Cloud becomes a place of "sentimental interest. For there
gather - ; iriv its /gardens V! and ; its cafes many, a bridal-party who have come
tor., a 'wedding, supper andf. for ? a .'wedding dance.
â¢/It^is^aUdyely spot, this. smW old town. v of v St. -Cloud, ; which rises, in an
amphitheater, on -;the left bank of the Seine, beneath the modern walls of Montre-;
Lout. .There iis-a" park here," and a terrace, cascades and fountains, and a won
lerfiil view, over; the green treetops'of the, nearby Bois -de 'Boulogne, of the tow-
domes of Paris, of the enormous wheel, and of the great viaduct or

' In May particularly, it is a paradise of \ transcendent delights, when the
foliage .1 is jib; nil i the freshness of its springtime beauty, "when overhead "the chest
.nut lights her mimic chandelier," when across the fields the
make rifts of splendor."
'â¢ Besides, on. the first three Sundays of May the waters
\u25a0play, adding a 7a 7 pleasing artificial touch to the natural - beau
ties of the scene. '
\ No wonder that the good > bourgeois of , pleasure-loving
Paris come hither by carriage, team or steamer, to lose for a
while their sense of worldly care and, with the spontaneous
gayety of grown-up children*: to revel for one summer hour in.
thesunlit show of earth and sky.
; Nor is it strange that bridal parties choose St. Cloud as a
suitable setting for, orange blossoms and for wedding finery.
Itls so 'cheap a: treat, too, if you know where *to go. For the
price;of the wine wherewith to drink the^health of bride and
groom, you can gain the privilege; of dancing to good music
ma ballroom which, 1 small though it is. is anything but un
attractive." â¢ .< . \u25a0- 4 -.:.
' There is a curiously matter-of-fact air about s a French
bridal ;party. One can discern at a glance that me. occasion is
socna;atiaiJiotTi'Cmantic : in' character* "Two people are, joining their lives together
for mutuar advantage. .Thus far their relationship is on. a business basis. They
may come to love" each other. The chances are that they will do so, for this la
part of l their, expectations." - .\u25a0\u25a0;, Vi -' -â¢ ;'<\u25a0
But love i and marriage are in France two different ideas. The latter does not
presuppose the former,-' but at any. rate: it" dees not preclude it. and that indicates
something gained since. the days of old France.' when feudal courts of love de
creed that between two married people. Love could not exert his powers.
: Love ;la : no longer in France ''wholly extra : nuptial and anti-matrimonial," as
a modern critic has humorously. defined the., rapturous sentimentality which the
troubadours of Provence poetically, named "Joy." '

Palliet asks that the court take charge
of the property and that his stock be
returned to him on the grounds that his
partners are trying to oust him Illegally.
The case will be heard next Monday.
Frank L. Palliet, manager and one of
the owners of the Clarendon Hotel at
&40 Bush street, appeared before Judge
Trotitt yesterday^ and asked that he be
granted an equitable lien on the property
and that a receiver be appointed to wind
up the affairs of the business. He al
leges that he has taken this action to
prevent being forced out of the company
by the other stockholders.
Palliet was for many years the man
ager of Marchand's Restaurant. He says
that be becamepart owner of the Clar
endon with A. Fodera. P. Welniger, A.
Madsen and S. N. Rucker a year ago
and that they formed a corporation to
carry on the business. It was the un
derstanding that the capital stock was
secured by the furniture and fixtures of
the hotel. He put up $6000 for his share.
In the meantime tne business of the
Clarendon was not prosperous and one
day, tn his absence and without bis
knowledge declared Palliet to the court,
the other stockholders met and decided to
levy an assessment on the stock. Learn
ing that the meeting was Irregular, he
refused to pay and the others bought his
holdings from under him. They gave him
\u25a0nothing in return, because they said the
stock was worthless, and in the mean
time they were trying to sell the busi
ness to George Gow, tne owner of the
building. Back rent was due Gow and

The right of cities and towns of Cali
fornia to grant to any railroad the priv
ilege of passing through their . limits was
further affirmed by Superior Judge Sea
well yesterday. His opinion was reached
in the suit of the California North
western Railway Company, whlchSought
to prevent the Petaluma and Santa Rosa
Railway Company from crossing its lines
within the city of Santa Rosa, the plain
tiff corporation contending that its rails
marked. the boundary where competition
must "begin and end.
"Judge Seawell has upheld the petition
of the. Petaluma and Santa Rosa com
pany ' and has ordered an injunction is
sued against the California Northwest
ern. He based his decision on the
reasoning of the Supreme Court in the
suit- instituted by the San Francisco and
San Joaquin -Railway Company, which
first ' attacked the big railway corpora
tions whose lines" cross the State, and
established the principle that those acts
are to be upheld that tend to the most
public good and aim to break existing
or threatened monopoly.^
CONGREGATION MADE HAPPY
BY PASTOR'S ASSURANCE
Rev. Dr. Hemphill May Take a I-onjc
Vacation, but Says He Will .
Not Retire.
The apprehension of the congregation
of Calvary, Presbyterian, Church was
allayed yesterday evening: at the prayer
meeting when the Rev.- Dr. Hemphill
announced, that he- did not Intend re
signing his pastorate. Later in the
evening, however. Dr. Hemphill said he
might be compelled to ask for a leave
of absence of three or six months.
The. report that he was going to re
tire grew out of a statement made by
Dr. iHemphill at a time when he was
suffering great . emotion, to the effect
that unless his strength , returned he
would have to give up ,work.
'.Dr.. Hemphill said last night: "In
San Francisco I mean to live and labor
until I die, when I expect to be buried
in San Mateo County. There is no other
church in the country that would be
any .temptation to me to-day. Calvary
is the only church I ever expect to
serve."

The Padflo Mail Company's liner City
of Sydney, Captain McLean, which
Ehould have sailed Saturday, took her
departure yesterday for Panama and
way ports. Upon the Sydney's arrival
here she was ordered into quarantine to
be fumigated, a death from fever having
occurred during the homeward voyage.
The detention at Angel Island and the
lack of space to discharge her cargo
made It impossible to get the liner ready
for sea on the date scheduled for de
parture. To make up for the uelay the
Sydney will not call at Mazatlan on the
outward passage.
The Sydney carried 2200 tons of cargo
end about thirty steerage passengers, of
whom all were Chinese. Among the
cabin passengers werejthe following:

upon the' trio has already, been made, and
the attorneys here are patiently awaiting
a formal return to be made by the Sheriff,
f It was through the wives 6t Rumsby

the funds^ were traced to San Francisco.
Mrs. I'.Rumsby1 '. Rumsby and Mrs. Reggies are still
under surveillance in this city, and are

The suit "filed" by Attorney Pence ' con
veys , no intimation of 'the r importance

rious times the defendants, Rumsby, Reg
gies and Jones, known ; under numerous
aliases, ; became' Indebted 'to ; the bank ~in
the -.amount 'of $14,500, , and \u25a0 that on May

SAYS SHE OWES LIFE
TO A CORSET STAY
Mrs.Olamici C. Dolan Swears
Husband Tried to
Stab Her.
"I owe my life to a good, strong cor
set stay." said AfrsÂ». "Mami*Â» C. Dolan in
Judge Graham's court yesterday, while
â¢prosecuting her suit for divorce from
Marlon J. Dolan. "My husband con
stantly abused me. and one night in a
rage he grabbed a knife from the table
and tried to plunge it into mV body. It
struck one of ray corset stays and this
saved my life, for the force of the blow
was sufficient to drive it' clear through
me." Mrs. Dolan got her divorce.
From the good, plump weight of 131
pounds, Mrs. Alice Starr Joell says she
has fallen away to 107 pound 3. because
of her husband's cruelty. John J. Joell
Is the man accused of cruelty, and Mrs.
Joell asks that she be granted a decree
of divorce from him.
Decrees of divorce were granted yes
terday to Marie from William Heydsn
for cruelty, Mildred C. from E. T. Nich
ols for desertion, and Bertha L. from
Jacob B. Unruh for desertion. Suits for
divorce were filed by Mary Anne
against Charles H. Schllchting for
cruelty, Edward against Elaine Jones
for desertion. Annie against Calvin
Friend for desertion, and Bridget
against Patrick J. O'Neill for cruelty.

gone Into the hands of a temporary re
ceiver. A notice was posted, signed by

The receivership is due to the dis
covery that the bank was a victim of
forgeries of Benjamin 11. Gaskill to the
extent of $80,000. This, together with
losses sustained by the surety depart
ment of the concern, determined the
finance committee of the company to
apply for receivership.

showed resources and liabilities aggre
gating $2,236,591, of which $1,335,814 ia
due to depositors. The president Is J.

Future drain and Pro vision*.
CHICAGO, June ; 21.â Weakness in the
wheat market prevailed at the start to-day.
Initial- quotations on July being off %@ 1,4 c,
at SS%c to S9c. The opening decline war
.mainly a reflection : of lower prices at Liver
pool. Although ' \u25a0 additional rain has fallen
throughout a large portion of the wheat belt,'
comparatively, little apprehension . seemed " to
be felt among pit traderst who- sold quite
freely on the light decline In foreign markets.
\u25a0 - Commission houses were fair buyers, but the
demand was not sufficient to prevent the price
of. July declining to 88% c. Suddenly, how
ever, the, market turned bullish. Prices made
a quick advance, July selling:' up to 90c. The
greatest strength was manifested in the July
option.' the reaÃon being the high prices being
paid for cash wheat (new. crop) In- the South
west market.. A report from St. Louis stated
that %X per bushel was paid -for No. 2 red new
wheat. .- Another cause for the sudden upturn
â¢was a reDort that while harvesting in Okla
homa is progressing rapidly, the yield Is only
poor to fair. Shortage In yield was said to
be due to chinch' bugs and black rust."- From
the Northwest simultaneously .came reports of
fresh damage by rust.'./ Late : In the session
the market again turned ~ weak. The reason
was heavy liquidation of September by an in
fluential long. . All the advance was lost, the
final quotations on July being %c to VtC lower)
at 88%@S9c. -" V Â» :\u25a0\u25a0 .;-. \u0084 â¢. . :
Liberal profit \u25a0â¢ taking by prominent holders
caused a weak close in the corn pit. July
opened %c lower at 64%. sold between 64% Â®
64 % c, and closed -%c lower at 64% c.
' The oat market was strong early, closing
easy. July opened unchanged 'at 31% c, cold
between Sl%c and 81% c and closed %c lower
at 3194 c." -.' -'-/' -\u25a0'â¢ i< ,\u25a0â¢ \u25a0"-' '\u25a0- \u25a0\u25a0'.\u25a0' . â¢*.'; \u25a0\u25a0â¢ -.

NEW TORK. June 21. â The speculative
leadership for which the rank and file cf small
traders had been watching in order to deter
mine the direction of their ventures asserted
Itself In the Mock markft to-day, and whipped
up a t-har;. prire movement and a considerable
degree of animation. It was evident that the
outstanding ehort intT*6ts had bÂ«*n extended
to unsuspected proportions, owing to the
temptation of professional operators to take
the Fhort side in a dull market. The demand
from the uncovered 6horts formed an Impor
tant flerarnt in extending the advance when
ihiÂ» aggressive leadership had ests-blished
Itself. The ammunition employed by this
leadership Â»as not all of a 'very substantial
character, and some of the Incidents of the
day were of a kind that would have proved
distinctly discouraging in a market where de
pression was the order of the day. But the
long resistance to repeated attack which the
market had shown, and the moderate success
In the last two days of efforts to get prices up,
fcad gathered puch cumulative effect that a
comprehensive upward movement was the re
sult. A considerable volume of realizing sales
was found to overhang the market, placed
there by anxious holders who have been wait
ing for an opportunity to sell their stocks.
These were absorbed with a good deal of facil
ity. It was not until late in the day that
the movement to take profits began to make
any effective drag on the prices. By that
time the considerable portion of the require
ment for the short Interest had been setlsfld.
The early movement centered largely In special
ties, and United States Steel pereferred made
an errectiw leader. Reports of large ordrrs
for Russian navar reconstruction were current,
and Eometbin* was made of the published de
nials by ex-President Schwab of an Intention
to combine a number of Independent corpora
tions to <-<-ir.p<?te-wUh the United States Steel
Corporation. It became known that the re
port of the State Superintendent of Insurance
on the Equitable Life Investigation would be
riven cut to-night, and the hope was Indulged
that this might be the last episode of any sen
rational character In that long-drawn-out cub-
Ject, a consummation that would afford great
relief to all stock-market Interests. Doubtful
factors, which were Ignored during the day,
\u25a0were crop damage reports, a reduction in
the price of refined sugar, a passing of a divi
dend en Corn Products preferred and declara
tion of the regular dividend on Lehlgh Val
ley. Instead of a hoped-for Increase, and the
discovery of fraudulent raising of stock certifi
cates In Philadelphia. Any one of these Inci
dents would have unsettled the market at any
time In the recent past. The closing of a
trust company In Philadelphia, announced late
tn-day. had a disturbing effect. The closing
tone was unsettled and Irregular.
Bonds were firm. Total sales, par value,
J4.240.0&0.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

NEW YORK, June 21.â COFFEEâ Cables of
fered no encouragement to local bulls.' Some
little buying for European account at the
opening caused a firmer tone, but the demand
was limited and disappointing. The fact re
mains that our 'stock is too large at the end
of the season, and although interior supplies
are email, the demand indicates a waiting
policy. The course of the market hinges on
whether Europe will be more ' anxious to buy
than Brazil to sell new crop arrivals. \u25a0 < .'\u25a0

proposed award of a contract to Madi
gan &. O'Neil to furnish horses and bugr
gtes to the city for $34 per month. The
protestants claimed that proper service
could not be given at the price named
and the association had established a uni
form rate of $35. The attorney for
Madigan & O'Xeil held that the com
mittee could not. under the charter,
award the contract to any but the low
est bidder and charged that a combina
tion had been made to keep up the price
and rob the city. E. K. Pease took ex
ception to the last remark, saying that
the price was agreed upon because it> is
considered a fair charge. i'ease said
Msdigan & O'Xeil had withdrawn from
the' association because the firm did not
wish to pay Its dues. Madigan came
back with the charge that the associa
tion had reduced the wages of their
hackmen from $2 50 to $2 per day after
the combination was 'made.

Judge Cabaniss dismissed the charges
of Battery and larceny which -A. V.
Doan of 744 Devisadero street had filed
against Mrs.; Emma Pell, whose domicile
of Questionable character Is' in the 100
block of Taylor street. -After he had
been ejected from the housÂ£ by the mus
cular defendant Mr. Doan t telephoned a
summons for a patrol wagon.' then blew
several: shrill blasts. on a whistle, then"
rushed, to Market -street' and "told his
troubles to two policemen. . His statement
varied with 'repetition; the. amount al
leged to have been stolen from him rang
ing all the way from $10 to $500, and the
alleged battery consisting ; of almost
every kind of bodily assault i from simple
laying on of hands to attack with a dead
ly weapon. Mrs. Pen denied the ; larceny
and acknowledged the battery, alleging
that the latter, committed \.with a broom
stick, was provoked by Mr. ; Doan's 'dis
orderly behavior; in" her- dwelling, his" re
fusal to leave when she requested him "to
do so and his attempt *to ' throttle her

Four small .boys^ who were arrested
for placing toy torpedoes upon the rails
of a car. track at Birch and Willow
avenues, were dismissed after being
sharply reprimanded by Judg- Mogan,
who told .them, that' while: patriotism
was. a beautiful thing, its .premature
ebullition via the firecracker route is
reprehensible. ,
Max Bush, an orchestra 4 leader, met
another orchestra leader night before
last and with him discussed the decad
ence of music, each telling point being
emphasized by the absorption of beer,
until the mentality of both gentlemen
became profoundly befogged. How or
where they separated Mr. Bush could
not remember when he appeared before
Judge Conlan on the charge of ma
licious mischief, nor did he have the
slightest recollection of smashing a
telephone in the Alcalde apartment
house, on ,'O'Farrell street,, because of
his dissatisfaction with Its- service. He
agreed to pay damages and the- case
was dismissed. f \u25a0
where the man was formally charged
with having utilized the artificial limb
as a medium of peace disturbance.
Ever since the spring exodus of
street beggars commenced, the com
plaining officer informed Police Judge
Mogan, the public conduct of Mr. Wil
liamson has steadily waxed in offens
iveness. j Whereas during the winter
months he kept himself and his bogus
leg in commendable order, no sooner
did the vernal ' season dawn than he
began to cut . unlawful capers. He
drank unsparingly of intoxicants, and
under their influence did things which
the prudence of sobriety would have
prevented him doing. One of his favor
ite feats while in inebriety was to lie
prone upon his back and extend the
wooden leg at right angles to its flesh
and-blood fellow, ertid then upon the
pole thus erected he would hang his
hat and wave it while he uttered
strange sounds. Another annoying
habit he acquired was that of suddenly
projecting his wooden leg in front of
a coming pedestrian and holding it there
as a barrier until he concluded his
stereotyped appeal for monetary aid.
But his crowning trick, and the one
which provoked his arrest, was that
of detaching the timber limb from his
person and swinging it around his head
as if it were an Indian club, accom
panying the performance by chanting

Mr. \u25a0 Williamson had. no defense to
offer, other than to aver that in Chi
cago, where he spent many happy days,
a gentleman crippled as he was re
ceived more kindly police consideration
than has ever been extended to him in
San Francisco. Then he was pro
nounced guilty as charged and in
formed that to-day he will ascertain
just how long he shall be retired from

"depending on j \u25a0 the 'will or discretion,"

WILL TAKE APPEAL
TO SUPREME COURT
Judge Troutt admitted that the point
Involved was a new one, and that no de
cision had ever been made on it. He
told Mrs. Reed that he -would enter the
final decree, but that she should file an
objection with him bo that the case could
be immediately taken to the Supreme
Court of California. This was done yes
terday.
The first wife of the Guatemalan plant
er also alleges that she was fraudulently
treated ia the first distribution of the
community property, and asks that a new
assignment be made.
' This appeal Is to determine the moot
question whether a man and his wife
fcear the same legal relations and owe
f&ch ether the same duties during the
time elapsing between the granting of
the Interlocutory and the final decree
cf divorce as they did before the pro
ceedings were instituted.
Mrs. Reed alleges that Reed was a
nan of comparative wealth when she
began the interlocutory proceedings for
divorce on June 3, 1905, and that he ef
fected a private settlement with her.
At this time he was infatuated with the
charms of Mrs. Orear, and less than two
months after the granting of the first
decree, Mrs. Reed alleges, the two em
barked for Guatemala. On the steamer
they registered as husband and wife and
at the plantation home in the south Reed,
it is claimed, always introduced the wo
man, as his wife.
Louis P. Eoardman, attorney for Mrs.
Reed, objected to the order, saying Reed
was entitled to no relief, legal or equit
able, as he had . committed the crime of
bigamy by remarrying within the statu
tory year that must elapse from the date
of the decree to make him again a single
man. Judge Troutt denied the motion
and the final decree was entered. In the
meantime Reed arrived in the city, went
to Oakland and claimed as his bride
yiTf. Louis Orear of that city, the cere
mony being performed last Saturday.
But nothing daunted Mrs. Reed and her
attorney again appeared before Judge
Troutt yesterday and asked that the or
der entering a final decree be set aside
and that Reed be summoned for exam
ination upon a motion for redistribution
of community property. Attorney Board
man also made a demand for $500 counsel
fees and $100 costs. All of the motions
â¢were denied and in behalf of Mrs. Reed
re tie* of appeal was given.
George W. Heed. Guatemalan planter
and raiser "of coffee of rich aroma, is not
yet beyond the legal reach of Mrs. Helen
B. Reed, who divorced him just a little
over a year ago. A few weeks ago Reed's
attorney appeared before Judge Troutt
and demanded that the interlocutory de
cree issued to Mrs. Reed be entered as
final on the records.
William Williamson is one of the

ing rural delights could not tempt to
abandon the city's close confines. While
the majority of his fellows in alms

ing them to mountain or seaside. Mr.
Williamson and his wooden leg clung to
their old stand at ' Market and Fourth
streets - until 2 o'clock last Tuesday
afternoon, when Patrolman J. Conlon
removed them to the municipal prison.
"The queer thing about' this defendant,"
said Patrolman J.. Reed, alluding to A.
Walters." "is that almost j every time I

Stanley C. Herold of San Jose had no
sooner arrived in the cicy. and deposited
his gripsack in a hotel than' he went to
the barber shop at 60 '\u25a0 Ellis street \u25a0Â« to get
a shave and "shampoo, and the stains of
travel removed from his garb. As . he
had not walked from San .Jose his shoes
were clean enough to pass" muster in po
lite society, but "that fact did -not deter
an enterprising, bootblacki from insisting
on shining them as their wearer reclined
in the chair.) Mr. Herold's recumbent at
titude prevented him offering any resist
ance, more strenuous than, oral . protest,
which was unavailing/and, when he was
released, from the tonaor's hands his foot-,
gear" was aglitter, and the bill presented'
to him included an item of 10 cents for
the shine. This he' resolutely declined to
pay, whereupon the proprietor of the es
tablishment commandeered his \u25a0 hat,
doubtless hoping thereby; to induce its
owner to pungle up the one dime short
age. But he underestimated the stern
ness of the stuff he was contending with.
Instead of yielding to what \he volubly
pronounced an attempt to extort, Mr.
Herold went forth with: bared head and
recounted the incident' to Judge Caba
niss, who Issued a search warrant for the
recovery of the hat or the arrest of its
holder. The outcome of the case is
breathlessly awaited.

Arthur L. Adams, consulting engl- j
neer for the Contra" Costa Water Com
pany, occupied the witness chair yes
terday afternoon in the courtroom of
United States Commissioner Heacock,*
M. B. Kellogg appeared for the .Spring
Valley Water Company and City At
torney Long.- for the city. - : â¢ â¢ >
Mr. Adams expressed the opinion that
Engineer. Grunsky's proposed Tuolumne
water system was Impracticable and
would - cost very much more than the
estimates given by Mr. Grunsky. The
witness declared that an adequate
water â¢â supply could : not be : brousht ; to
this city by a single pipeline from the
Tuolumne watershed, and that a double
pipeline would cost $4 4,000,000 't0 bring
water ' to this city,, exclusive of the
distributing system, and a thlrd'pipe
liner which. the' witness asserted- would I
be- absolutely necessary, would add
$13,000,000 to the foregoing estimate,"
The: witness did not consider tha
scheme a safe one. To install the Tuo
lumne system with an equivalent ca
pacity:to that of Spring Valley, namely
35,000,000 gallons dally, would, cost not
less than i $50,000,000, in the opinion of
the witness. There was no . ex- j
travagance. he said, in the construction
of the Spring Valley, system and great
foresight had been shown' in acquiring
properties \u25a0 capable -of expansion from
a supply of; 21,000,000 gallons daily at
present to one exceeding that by 8,000,
000 gallons daily. By bringing in Por
tola,Creek and the Alameda system it
is. capable of expansion to -33,000,000
gallons daily, which,. added to the pres
ent capacity, would bring it up to 96,
500.000 gallons.
--The witness. gave his opinion that the
Spring; Valley Company t. had acted
wiselyin acquiring a great many prop
erties for' further use. He considered
the retention of Lake. Merced a" wise
thing. .for. the reason that all/water
systems should have a source of supply
near the city in case of emergency.
â¢ The , witness said .further that.Grun
sky's proposed Tuolumne water system
could not be built inside of eight years,
and that if the 'work were, begun now
this city in. 1913 would require not less
than 45,000,000 gallons daily,, an In
crease of 10,000.000. "
Mr. Adams will resume his testimony
at 2 p. m. : to-day..
