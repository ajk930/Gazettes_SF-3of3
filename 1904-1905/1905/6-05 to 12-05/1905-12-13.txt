Ready to Reveal Correspond
ence Involving' Carnegie
and Schwab.
PITTSBURG, Dec 12.â Plusburg was
astounded this afternoon by J. B. Corey.
uncle of W. EJlis Corey, who issued a
public letter relating to the Corey family
tcanfial. J. B. Corey, it will be remem
bered, rcade a statement last week in ef
fect that he blamed Andrew Carnegie for
raining the young head of the United
I States Steel Corporation (W. Ellis Corey),
and aiso cited Charles M. Schwab as an
other who had been ruined by Carnegie.
In his letter given to the public press
here this evening J." B. Corey makes an
ucusual proposition to the scandal-loving
public by which It may gain possession of
much correspondence which passed be
tween Andrew Carnegie. Charles M.
Schwab. W. E. Corey and himself and
which, he promises, will throw much
light on the "disgraceful scandal."
The letter Is addressed to the report
ere of Plttsburg and is in part as fol
lows:
"My Dear Reporters:
(A wliiti>er win euffic*).
X .. v.-t; thou no tyivi:; cook
Whtre ec&ndils do not arise?
"If it be true, as Indicated by urgent re
(juesta made to me by newspapers from
Maine to California for further install
! merits of the W. E. Corey scandal with
which to satisfy the morbid cravings of
your readers, you have, 1 think, the se
cret of this young man's disgraceful con
duct. I am being importuned day and
right, in ray office and at my home, for
additional facts upon which to build the
etory of this young man's downfallâ by
reporters in person and by â¢wire fiom
leading cities, saying: 'Wire me at my
expense,' etc Also my telephone is kept
busy as late .at night as U o'clock.
"1 cannot make good reporters believe
that they know ten times as much about
this Ccrey scandal as I do.' They -insist
that I was in secret correspondence be
tween Andrew Carnegie. Charles M.
Schwab, W. E. Corey and myself, and
â¢wish to give their readers the inside of
the whole nasty story. Now, I will make
these enterprising reporters this proposi
tion:
"Much as I dislike to be placed in the
attitude of the Pharisee who brought the I
woman taken in adultery to Christ, yet 1
will consent to stand in the Pharisee's
shoes. If you can convince me that the
demand of your readers is such that only
tbe obscene etuft* that has filled your pa
pers the past week will satisfy them, I
make you this proposition, to wit:
"If there are 100,000 readers who will
contribute 51 each, the money to be ap
plied to the Hebrew '. :slon of this city,
to which I myself have contributed $20,000
and have S5OOO deposited with the City
Deposit Bank of Pittsburg waiting for
nineteen others to do likewise: if this
proposftioa Is accepted I will consent to
allow the correspondence that has passed
between Andrew Carnegie, Charles M.
Schwab and W. E. Corey, on which has
resulted the scandal, to be published, and
the contributors may rely that they will
gÂ«t their moneys worth.
"I \u25a0will aiso promise not to make public
the names of the contributors."

JOHN BAIRD
IS KILLED BY
DEADLY AUTO
Big Car Overturns
Crushing Victim

Two Women and Man
in > Party Escape
Machine Suddenly Becomes
Unmanageable During Ride
on the Corbett Road.
On the lonely mountain side crossed. by
the Corbett road " ( John Rush Bain} lay
uear ihe midnight hour last night pin
ioned under a large automobile that
pressed fc un helnless and dying beneath
its inexoi'i.ble bulk, while a woman who
had been, his eomnanlon on the ride flew,
down Ihe hill in terror seeking those
who jnisht come to the aid of the doomed
man.
Through the' night with all the speed
that the horror of, the situation could key :
her up to the woman* ran until she;
reached Eighteenth street, where she saw
a car coming over the hill from the park.
She hailed it. Tljere were several men
aboard the car and they ran^ back with
the woman, hoping. to save the life of the
man;beneath the auto." The "conductor .of
the car; telephoned , for ' the: ambulance of.
the Park : Hospital. -_ . ; . , . :
The men! who . hastened up -the dark
road"; to "the* scene -of^the accident* found*
there was 'nothing, for them" to do'but
take^thÃfdead'bodjr'of (a'rnan" from' be-"
neath v the -monster.' machine.' ." The wo
man moaned interror as the still* form
of Baird was pulled - out and ' laid', be
side the road. ' ' She . took the ghastly
head in her lap- and tried- to call her
late companion back to life.
The accident that caused Baird's death
occurred where the Corbett road crosses
Ashbury street on the slope of Twin
.rcaks. The woman who was with ; him,
who' gave . her name \u25a0as Ruby Brown
and her residence as , the Princeton Ho
tel, said it was due to' the machine :not
working properly. J When Dr. Kueich, -In
charge of the park ambulance, reached
the place Baird was dead." - The body was
taken to the hospital in the ambulance,'
the woman accompanying it.
Baird's companion said she was some
times' known as Neil, as she. had been
adopted by a man of that name, and
that she was a great friend of Baird's
mother. This is her story of the acci
dent: * ' . .. . .;'-:\u25a0 ' ; ":\u25a0 ,-'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
"Mr. Baird and myself went to San
Mateo on a car about^2 o'clock this
afternoon. There he rented an auto
mobile /without my knowing It and we
started for this city about 4 orV 5
o'clock. We had luncheon at. Uncle
Tom's Cabin, and : upon reaching the
city autoed. about the Mission for some
time. Then we went to 'Tom's Cabin
at the park -entrance and from there
to the Casino, where we took', dinner.
From there we went to the beach. and
along the boulevard and up the Ingle
side road. It was then getting pretty
late, but he decided to .take the Corbett
road around the mountainside: home. ';..
â¢ "At the -corner; of . Ashbury 'street -and
near ihe residence of Architect Burnham
there was a gate across : the - road and I
got out to' open It." After I had -done so
Mr. Baird* tried to start ; the. ma
chine and it would \ not . go. He
called to me to come and try to
start Jhe ..wheels.- The machine: start
ed down the grade, but he seemed
to have no, control of It, something being
wrong. About . 150 : feet ' down /he :\u25a0 turned
tfce : machine Into the ' embankment. ' I
ran down end found ; him pinioned under
it. -Tb c auto had turned completely over
and only, his head could " be seen. ,He toÂ»d
me to 'kick' '; the \ lights * out, ..which < I ?uidf
Then he told me to . get help, as he could
not work ; himself - out. J"* I'< ran ' as : fast r as .
I could and" stopped the ". car .that "\u25a0. l ] saw
coming 'over? the grade. V" ' ,
: Dr.' Kucich 4 said ithat ; death \u25a0\u25a0 had ;\u25a0 been

. That Harrlman demanded the right
!to name two of five trusteed and to
â¢ vote the controlling Mock fa the elec

In reply to repeated questions by
Charles E. Hughes, counsel for the
'committee. Ryan stated that Harriman
did not ' threaten that there wouid.be
legislative action unless he were given
a share In the Equitable control, but
j said, there probably would be such ac
tiojf; Jiejther did Harriman threaten
! any action, by an officer of the Gov

"It was a strenuous interview, Ryan
.said, And was -held in the presence of
Ellhu. Root, then Ryan's counsel, now
Secretary of State, andPaufD. Cravath,

/Committee that : he'. 1 drew the inference

also said -.that he* paid no attention to

Mr. -Harriinan. said' That I should not

him ;on' that day. - Harriman saw him
again' oh; the. --following .Monday or

"political, influence wtfuld -be /against me,

did!h6t Bay how his actions in the mat

HYAS DKCLIXES TO BE SCARED.
"Bid Harriman say there would be
anything Injurious to j your interests if
you refused to sell?" asked Hughes.
"He said his entire influence would be
against me," replied Ryan.. . ,
! 'Did he refer to the political influence
he-.woud. assert at the. interview at
which Mr. Root and .Mr.';. Cravath were
present?"
"My recollection is that he did."' ..
"Did he refer to, the,probabi..iy of legis

PJLKIS, Dec. 12.â A dispatch to the
Journal from St. Petersburg dated to-
C&r Bays that Minister of the Interior
Duriiovo has ordered the arrest of
hundreds of agitators in the agrarian
districts.
Another St. Petersburg dispatch to
the Journal says the officers and Jroops
at Moscow held a great meeting, at
â¢which it was decided to begin a cam
paign for economical and political, re
forms. Another meeting has been ar
ranged and official intervention is ex
pected.
The correspondent of the Matin at
St. Petersburg confirms the report of
the mutiny of Cossacks at Moscow.
He adds that the Socialist Alliance, has
issued a proclamation advising those
adhering to the alliance not to pay
taxes a.nd to withdraw their money
from tiie banks.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 12.â ThÂ«
sentiment of the workmen's delegates
has been somewhat raised by the re
ceipt of a dispatch from Moscow claim
ing that the revolutionary propa
ganda has finally taken root among
the Cossacks. The Third Sauadron of
Don Cossacks is reported to have held
a meeting and to have drawn up serv
ice demands, claiming that the men are
fed like dogs and shabbily clothed.
The Government officials were forced
to deprive the soldiers of their rifles
and lances. This is the first sign of
disaffection on the part of the Cos
sacks.

ing graphic details of the massacreof
forty Jewish families at Nozofka, Rus
sia, reached Isaac J. Robinson in this
city to-day, and' by ' them he w^is in
formed of the murder of- his elder "sis
ter,. Anna, and all" the members of , her
family. . A letter .written, by Mrs. Sarah
Polichkoff says in part: - â¢
"We have been , suffering for the last
few months, as our business had been
stopped and we could not make a liv
ing. None, would buy from us and we
cannot buy one cent's worth of food for
$5 in- money and we have been "really
starving:.
"One day a mob gathered around the
house of Sister. Anna. She was killed,"
together . with her son, 19.' years old.
They cut. his . body into small pieces
after they killed him and they chopped
her body in the same manner. And;then
another son of 17 years and a daughter,
of 15. and a daughter of 12 were treated"
I in the same manner. '\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0
"In the meantime the - brother
-In-law of ours. -. Meyer, ran I away
with the eldest daughter, 21 years
old, to save i their lives. He was
pursued .and slashed and cut. They
were stripped before the great mob and
in the presence of thousands of people
were , cut in | small, pieces and the pieces
brought back to the house they had es
caped from.
"After that the mob went next door
and they took the man, \u25a0woman and five
children out into the street. They took
their eyes out while they were alive
and then threw the blind people back
into the house and they were burned
alive.
"Out of the forty families in this
town, very few persons were saved. All
the houses were destroyed or burned."
The letter concludes with a. brief ac
count of how Mrs. Polichkoff escaped
through the kindness of a priest, who
hid her and the members of her family
in a cellar. ; ;

DR. riERCE'S REMEDIES.
No joyor pleasure on this eairth quite
equals that which comes into the home
when baby arrives. Who can ; describe
the happiness of man and woman, joined
in wedlock, as they look upon the fragile,,
delicate mite that is blood of their blood
j and flesh of their flesh ? And who can
depict the hopelessness and dejection
that hover about the home where I the
wife is incapable of becoming a mother?,
Barrenness proceeds from some derange-
ment of the distinctly feminine organs.
Many of the common ailments known as
"female troubles" cause it Dr.Pierce's
"Farorite Prescription overcomes barren-
ness by stamping out diseases of women,
j and by healing and curing ulceration. It
tones up the system, stops drains, and
restores strength. During gestation it i
modifies morning sickness, gives elastic--
ity to . the overstrained parts concerned, '
makes the hour of baby's coming short
and almost painless, and gives wonderful
recuperative power ito the patient "r By
making the mother strong and, cheerful ;i
it makes the little one healthy, vigorous
and good natured. Insist upon the med-
icine dealer giving you Dr. Pierce V Fa-

Pontiff Commends

oi ivioercy.
ROME, De?. 12.â The Pope has issued a
mpst ; important encyclical addressed to
the Bishops of Russian., Poland recom
mending that Poles- co-operate in the
pacification of the empire, obey their
rulers and avoid sedition.
The Pope says he is preoccupied by the
grave crisis in Poland and will try to
contribute to its complete pacification.
Evils are afflicting Poland, and many
duties' weigh upon the episcopacy and the
faithful. Among the: evils are subversive
parties .which, are spreading terror and
causing damage. Although the good Poles
are in the majority, they lack- energy^
which j renders possible the deplorable ex
cesses unworthy of civilized people,: such
as massacres' of '-'Jews; which are con
demned and detested by the .evangelical
law, which imposes love on 'all indiscrim
inately. \u25a0 , ~; ;-\u25a0 ;\u25a0 \u25a0- \u25a0 \u25a0' â¢\u25a0â¢ - : â¢;\u25a0\u25a0..'';\u25a0 i
Recalling the words of Pope Leo. XIII
in his encyclical of-1594, the Pontiff says:
"Be submissive to the rulers, who cxcr r
else power by the will of God. The Poles
should sacredly protect their civil disci
pline' and should abstain from taking part
in the plotsof 'wicked men. .From their
gatherings no seditious . act should ever
emanate, ahd they j should make every ef
fort to maintain peace. and Justice."'; 1 . .
i The Pope renders homage to the wisdom
and goodness 'of. Emperor "Nicholas, who
by the ukase of April 30 granted, freedom
\u25a0 of .conscience, "giving, happiness to . many
souls. This concession â¢ was '\u25a0; confirmed
and amplified by the ukase of i October 30,
so tho clergy must 'assist -those who wish
to embrace Catholicism: 1 * ;r-r \u25a0â¢ ! \u25a0 , :
The Pontiff concludes with exhorting
the Poles to avail themselves of the rights
of citizenship and with loyalty and dili
gence' to contribute to .- the progressive
amelioration of Russian Poland/ assuring
{hem^that he will constantly use his in
fluence with the Emperor j and ' the Gov
ernment for the religious and moral good
of, the Polish people. '

FIENDS BLOW UP
TOBACCO PLANT
Kentucky Factory Operated
for Trust Destroyed â¢ as
Eesult of Commercial War
TRAIN..-' ALSO HELD UP
Outrages of Billies"
of Growers' Association
Cause Great Uneasiness
ELKTON, Ky., Dec. 12.â The* tobacco
factors' here owned by Mrs. H. H. Penyck
and operated for the tobacco trust by the
American Snuff j Company : was "blown up
by dynamite early to-day.'- There was no
loss of life, but the - damage to . the : fac
tory was complete. There was no insur
ance on the plant, as the insurance com
pany had only a fewdays ago canceled
the policy owing to the excitement occa
sioned in this locality by the tactics of
some tobacco growers. Several houses in
the vicinity were damageed,; as were also
the depot and" four* ' or "* five ' passenger
coaches standing on a siding. - r .
Tha deed is thought to have been com
mitted by parties friendly to the Dark
Tobacco Growers' Association, but the
latter has severely condemned such ac
tions. "<-. \u25a0;
A few days ago the representative of
the American /Tobacco ; Company at thia
point received notice not to receive any.
more tobacco from people favoring the
trust, but he paid no attention to it
The conductor of a passenger train on
the Elkton and Guthrie Railroad stated
to-day that late last night as his train
was [making' the return trip from Guthrie
to Elkton he was flagged at Bradshaws,
a email 'station, two miles south of here.
When the' train stopped the engine was
boarded by masked men, who instantly
covered the engineer with revolvers and
told him to do 'their, bidding.
While this was going on about 150 men,
all heavily masked, \u25a0- boarded the train,
about forty of them marching from one
end to .-the- other, with drawn revolvers.
The leader of the gang told the passen
gers not to get excited, as they were"Â»only
looking for tobacco buyers. , After a thor
ough search of the train had been made <
all the men, as far as the j conductor'
knew, left the coaches and the engineer
was ordered to proceed. The train then
moved on to Elkton.
For a long time the Dark Tobacco
Growers' Association has opposed an ele
ment in its organization known as the
"Hill Billies,"' whose depredations while
"night-riding" have caused much uneasi
ness In this district, where nearly all the
dark tobacco grown In the world Is
raised. This matter has been within three
.weeks the subject of an examination by
a special agent of the Department of
Commerce and Labor, and his report on
the matter is now believed, to be at the
department in Washington. â¢
The head of the Dark Tobacco Growers'
Association is F. G. Wing of Nashville,
Term., and ha has frequently taken occa
sion to express his disapproval of the
methods of the "Hill Billies."
It was .learned to-day that a tobacco
factory at Trenton, Ky., controlled "by
Italian contractors was burned several
nights ago.'
GUNBOAT WASP
LIMPS TO PORT
NEWPORT, Dec. 12.â The little gun
boat Wasp, formerly the yacht Colum
bia, came into port this afternoon with
one boiler working and several sails set
after a terrific battle with a North At
lantic hurricane during which she
sprung a leak, and. was kept- afloat
after her pumps choked through hand
bailing by her entire crew. The little
vessel was blown nearly to the Gulf
Stream by Sunday's storm, and was
nearly two days getting -back to port.
At one time the water, which came
in through a leak in. the, stern, flooded
her engine room, and for ten â¢' hours on
Sunday the Wasp was at -the mercy of
the waves.
The crew of sixty men, : a third of
whom were apprentices and unused to
such boisterous conditions, bailed for
hours with buckets and, succeeded in
'freeing the engine:. 1 room.' Hospital
Steward White sustained a broken rib,
but refused to give up* his; place in the
balling line.' '.
The success of Chief Boatswain Hugh
Sweeney, the- commander of the Wasp,
in bringing his vessel" through the hur

Senate Committee Learns
That He Signs Checks and
Deals Directly With Tait
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. â The emer
gency appropriation bill to provide ;the
isthmian canal commission with, funds
to "carry, 'on . the construction of 'the
Panama \u25a0 canal will contain no ' general
legislation. This was - decided |by the
Senate .Committee, on Appropriations at
a meeting lasting all of to-day and" at
which It was agreed to report the meas
ure appropriating $11,000,000, the
amount named by the House bill
Secretary Taf t of the War Depart
ment, Theodore P. Shonts, chairman of
the canal commission ;J Joseph B. Bish
op, secretary, and other officials of the
commission, were before the committee
and were subjected to pointed inquiries
as to the manner of making expendi
tures. :
'The examination of Bishop, who had
been referred to in the House debates
as a "press -agent" for the commission,
was of w a personal nature, in that he
was asked to define his duties. # It was
shown that in addition to acting as sec
retary he is a sort of diplomatic agent,
charged with meeting any contingency
that may arise. â¢ In the absence of
Shonts or Pepperman, the assistant chief
of- -administration, "Bishop assumes
their duties in Washington, even to the
extent of signing checks, and deals di
rectly with the Secretary of War in
relation to canal matters.
Bishop said he was the historian for
the commission and assembled data: of
all kinds that may be of u3e. He ad
mitted that to.' some extent his informa
tion was used for the public press.'*
In his capacity of literary secretary.
Bishop explained, He was not expected
to create public sentiment, but to keep
lit normal. In explanation he said that
Lthere- had been a determined effort on
the part of the opposition to direct
public feeling against the canal, and
that before he entered the > employ . of
the Government his services had been
sought by' those interested at more
liberal- compensation than he was now
receiving. ,. When asked to name the
opposition interests Bishop specified
the Nicaragua. the Tehuantepec and the
Darien canals, and ventured the sur
mise that transcontinental rail
roads also were "concerned in the op
position to the canal.

HIS OWN LAWYER
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Dec. M2.â Adolph Weber, was
again the center |of attraction to-day in
court. He appeared at both morning and
afternoon sessions. Yesterday he prac
tically discharged all his attorneys except
F. P.* Tuttle. This .morning he objected
to a number* of items, in his guardian's
final account. At noon he posed before
a . photographer's camera, and late, in
the afternoon he became "philanthropic
and wanted to make, a ' gift j deed of the
Weber < home place to the Rechenmacher
children. Rechenmacber Sr. called on
Weber and offered him $1500 for the home
place, which adjoins the Rechenmacher
home,' and ; Weber offered to deed It to
his children. Rechenmacher refused to
accept: the gift. Weber's change of heart
toward Rechenmacher is interesting, for
at the time , of ; the murders Weber inti
mated that Rechenmacher might know
something about the crimes. /-.
Weber j also wrote a letter, to the court
to-day in which he objected to the size
of some of the attorneys' fees. He asked,
however, that Attorney Grove L. Johnson
be allowed $300 'additional, making !his fee
$2000. Samuel J. Pullen has received $1000,
F. P. Tuttle $1000 and Benjamin P. Tabor
$1200. John Adams, as Weber's guardian,
has drawn $1000. ; Weber, also objected to
the- hiring by one of the attorneys of a
detective to dog the steps of the jury
meh. On this subject Weber said:
''Are jurymen; who .have grown gray
in ' toil pleased to be told by such an act
that, they are considered bad boys, who
must be watched? I wondered what the
Attorney - General meant by. the missing
link. This attorney" likewise employed
a gun expert, a mere boy, who knew not
how to measure the bore of a gun, and a
juryman stated he .would have j acquitted
me had I, had the prosecution's expert.";
It is learned that Attorney.' l* K.Chamf
berlain ; was ' sent ; for " a few nights . since
and {asked by Weber to draw , up ; papers
revoking: the power of attorney given by
Weber \u25a0to John /Adams 'and make .'out a

the right, to, hire.. lawyers. : Weber re
eerves that right to himself.

WILL RENT HENS
TO RANCHMEN
Sseclal Dispatch to The Call.
RED BLUFF, Dec. 12.â Plans for the
incorporation of a. big poultry farm
at Corning are about completed. If the'
undertaking be carried out it will mean
great things, not only for Corning but
for. the entire county. This farm was
started a couple of years ago by an ex
perienced poultry nlan who had made
a few thousand dollars by following
the poultry business on a small scale
near Corning. He arranged. to go into
the business : in a* wholesale ' manner
and last year succeeded in' hatching
and raising over. 16,000 thoroughbred
White Leghorn fowls on his farm. The
hens were kept for' laying purposes,
while the roosters were sent. to a ready
arid profitable market "in San Francisco.
It is understod that the new corpora
tion Is backed by business men who are
interested In the upbuilding of the
Corning section. They- plan' to raise
thoroughbred chickens on a large scale,
at the same time paying great atten
tion to sanitary conditions and making
the poultry farm a model for smaller
growers to pattern after. The hens
will be rented to smalllandholdera of
the" community on a percentage basis.
The eggs will be gathered daily and the
promoters of the plan being ; thereby
able to" ship fresh eggs daily to the
city markets, will be in^ a position to
command a price in excess of the reg
ular market price. . k'
\u25a0 It is figured .that this excess In price
willbe equivalent to the rental charged
for. the hens, . thereby allowing the
farmers about the net, market price for
theeggs. The promoters contemplate
the erection of a large cold storage
plant, and when the market price falls
below' twenty cents a dozen the egg 3
will be gathered and placed on cold
storage to later compete in the winter
months ; with Eastern cold' storage
eggs. It , is expected that > the farmers
will have over, 1,000,000, hens producing
eggs ( ln. the next few years.

DEMOCRATIC
Fitzgerald Elected Mayor
by Plurality Much Less
Than That Given Collins
LEADS BY 8830 VOTES
Republican Strength Divided
Between Regular Nominee
and Independent Candidate
BOSTON. Dec. 12. â The Democrats
were victorious in Boston to-< Jay, elect
ing former Congressman John P. Flta
gerald Mayor over, three other candi
dates. \u25a0 Fltzgrerald's plurality over hla
nearest competitor. LouU A. Frothlngr
ham, Kenublican Speaker of the Massa
chusetts House of Representatives, was
S2SO. The vote for Mayor follows:
John F. Fitzgerald (D.). 44,316; Louis
A. Frothlngrham (R.), 35,636; Henry
S. Dewey , (Independent Republican),
11.657; James A. Watson (Citizens' and
Independent Democrat), Cl 5.
The vote to-day was unusually heavy
for a city election, more than 92.000
votes being- cast out of a total registra
tion of 114.000. Two years ago Patrick
A. Collins, a Democrat, was re-elected
by a plurality of more fEan 20.000. In
the recent State election the Democratic
gubernatorial candidate carried the city
by a plurality of approximately 16.000.
It was evident to-night that Fitzgerald
did not receive his full party vote, sev
eral strong Democratic districts, giv
ing Frothingham a plurality because of
factional differences.
To complicate the situation there
were two Republican candidates In the
fleld. Frothingham was the regular

Fe, which is an equal partner with
Chanslor & Canfield in the great Midway
holdings, has gone into oil at 1320 feet on

In that it proves a big oil territoy is em
braced in the lands purchased by the

belt on the west side in that particular
locality by fully a quarter of a mile.
On Saturday last the drill went into the
first oil sand, and since then It has been
steadily exploring a sand rich in oil. The
well will be sunk to 2000 or more feet if
necessary to produce the best results, it
being the intention to thoroughly^ test the

SALT LAKE KAILEOAI)
HAS JFIGHT ON HANDS
Dock Builders Remove a
Bridge aiid Then Prevent:
Its Restoration.: ;|
Scecial Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGEI^ES, Dec 12â The Los An
geles Dock and Terminal Company, which
proposes to dig a new deepwater harbor
within the corporate limits of the city of
Long Beach, began proceedings to-day in
what promises to be a legal battle which
may ultimately seriously interfere with
the Salt Lake railroad's line to the har
bor behind the Government breakwater at
San Pedro.
The dock company entered into a con
tract with a big San Francisco dredging
company to dredge a large area . of tide
lands, giving it out that the lands were
to be reclaimed and put on the market as
building lots. It was necessary- to take
out a Salt Lake railroad bridge to let the
big dredger pass into the slough, and that
work was done this morning. As soon as
the bridge was down the official "- an
nouncement was made that the dock
company is not in the real estate busi
ness, but, backed by unlimited capital
supplied by a syndicate of wealthy mer
chants, It proposes to build an entirely
new | harbor, capable of accommodating
the largest vessels on this coast. There
is nothing to prevent the work if the new
company has money enough, and it seems
to have all that is necessary. Once Its
dredger was through the bridge the com
pany applied for and secured an j Injunc
tion against the Salt Lake Railroad Com
pany forbidding them to put the bridge
back and claiming that It crosses naviga
ble water. . The United States Circuit
Court issued the order and the bridge has
not been restored.

POSTAL TUBES
FOR THIS CITY
Second Assistant .Postmaster
\u25a0 Says Main Postoffice "and
Eerry Should Be Connected;
WOULD SAVE MUCH TIME
Urges That the Pneumatic
System Be Built by Way
of * Station Near Palace
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I CALL. BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Dec. 12.â 1n his annual
report, published! to-day, Second Assist
ant '\u25a0': Postmaster General Shallenberger
recommends the installation of ; al,'a 1 ,' pneu
matic tube mail service from the f ener&l
postofflce via station X, which Is near the
Palace Hotel, to the ferry station' in San
Francisco. ; He Bays:
'The completion of the now poatofflc* build-
Ing and lta occupancy as the general poctotflc*
make It necessary that some relief ba pro
vided to offset In great part the delay caused
by the looatlon of the new postof flee more
than one and a halt miles i from s the farry
landing and on the edge of : the business dis
trict At the present 1 time j the I mall between
the general postofnee and the fÂ»rry is car
ried by an electric car and thÂ» time required
is twenty minutes. .This is the best: that can
be done under existing. conditions,, but it does
not prevent delay to a very considerable mall'
passing between the general postof flc* and
the ferry-boats connecting with , railway lines
\u25a0 which I carry 90 . oer cent of the | mall coming
and going from San Francisco, as well as many,
stations supplied via. the car lines at the foot
of Market street, where . the transportation '
lines of San Francisco concentrate.
A pneumatic tube service between the ferry
station and the general poatoffice by.wayof
station X would place the postal service ;of
San Franclflco In a much better condition.
Station X employs fifty carriers, does a buÂ»l- ;
â¢ncsa of $314,085 a year and >' serves a large
-wUoicsaJe and retail district.' Its mall would
'be advanced In delivery over the present
method, as would also the mall of the large
Â« district supplied .by the general postof flcÂ«. The
change In the site of the postof flee to A loca
tion so far removed from the ferry landing
Involves," under existing conditions, a delay of
more than half an hour , in the handling of
Asiatic, Hawaiian, Australian and Philippine
malls sent to San Francisco for dispatch from
that port. The dispatch of malls arriving on
the morning of the day of departure of steam
ers is seriously endanger*! by such delay In
handling and on account- of this delay some
mails are .neeewjarlly held ovtr for the next
etesumerâ a delay of weeks to Important mall.
1 - With pneumatic tube connection between the
ferry landing and the general postofflce this
mail will be placed in the postof flee within a
few minutes alter its arrival; at the ferries
and Important foreign malls of the whole
.country, will frequently; be advanced one
; ~ For this reason it is â¢ felt that tha question
of establishing a tube service is not merely
one of advancing Important business . mail of
this Pacific Coast metropolis, but is one that
concerns the whole country, rtnee It j sare-Â»
guards as well as may be, the dispatch of the
trans-Pacific mallÂ» arriving before the depart
ure of steamer*.
â¢ 'A 'commission considered the, question of
-tube connections to stations B and >B. but
do not consider that itrls advisable to
vide for such connections \u25a0 at â¢ this time. It is;
our opinion that the amount of mall to be
transmitted, the great saving of time to be
effected and the importance of the Interests
involved, both local and national, demand tho
establishment of the pneumatic tube service
between the ferry station, station X and the
general postofflce. a total of I:62. miles, with
an annual cost of $25,640. \u25a0. $ ;> - <

-who has b*<*n visiting in Berkley
for some weeks, had a narrow escape
from death> by asphyxiation at the
Berkeley Inn, Telegraph and Bancroft
avenues, last nisht.
The accident rt-sulled from the
young lady's carelessness in turning: off
the gas used in the {ras heater hi her

ber tube with the chandelier. On re
tiring Miss Lincoln turned off the gas
at the heater, but neglected to turn
the stop cock on the chandelier. The
rubber tube fell agrainst the hot gas
heater, a hole was burned in the tube
and the deadly nitmoxiae filled tiie
room.
Mrs. Ann B. Pray, proprietress of the
Inn. was passing down the hall at 11
o'clock oa her way to her room, when
she detected the odor of escaping gas.
She tried to get into Miss Lincoln's
room, but the door was locked and
there was no response to her knock.
Bhe called one of the men in the house
to her assistance and the door was
forced open, iliss Lincoln was found
lyins unconscious in bed. She had re
tired at 9 o'clock and had been :wj,
hours in the {fas-filled room,
Drs. T. C. McCleave and Dr. Emma

and after heroic work succeeded in
reviving the young woman. To-day
ehe is out of danger.
Miss Lincoln is an orphan. She is

SCIENTIST
WRITES OF
COLD BELT
BERKELEY. Dec. 12. â The cold water belt
that borfiera the Pacific Coast is discussed In
m. bulletin Just issued by the department of
reolosr of the State University, Professor R-
C- Holway writing- of it. ae a characteristic
ft&ture cf the physic&X sÂ«ogrephy of the west
coast of the United States.
In defining the extent of this cold belt.
Professor Holway fixes its ecithern limit at
Point Conception, and *howE that It docÃ not
continue "southward . along the coast of the
peninsula cf Lower California, as has been sup
jiOKCd by ether . geographer*. In summer the
coldest part of this bflt IS in the vicinity of
t/epe Blanco and Cajw Mendocino. The source
cf this cold coast wster, according to Profes
sor Holwaj 's hypothesis, is in tha ocean depths
to the ncrt hwejrtwa.nl, whence it drills at or
n*ar the ocean bottom, in agreement with .the
average direction cf the surface drift, and it
criven to the surface on Etriktag the dope of
tfÂ«> continental c helf. . ,
Professor Hoi way's conclusions are" based
upon the exarctnatlen of a large number of re
ports of ocean temperatures determined by
rydrographic surveys. An Interesting eug
e*stlon tÂ» made by the writer that the biologi
cal investigations being madÂ© of the San Diego
rejrfon by the workers of the Marine Biologi
cal Laboratory at La Jolla may determine
whether the cold water and the variations in
temperature nÂ»ar Cape Blanco are a barrier
to species of marine life that might normally
expand into the rÂ«?gicn*-io the northward.
The work of the laboratory at La Jolla. is
conducted ujidÂ«r the direction of Professor W.

V., in 1850, during the rush to the gold

EBELL WOMEN
PLEDGE COIN
FOR BUILDING
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND. Dec. 12.â 1n an address that was
at once strong and eloquent Mrs. J. B. Hume,
president of Ebell, rather scored the members
who, for various petty reasons, have been hold
ing aloof In the matter or the new club build
ing. Mrs. Hume is one of the best â if not the
best â women speakers In club circles. .. Firm In
her own convictions and fluent in her ability,
to voice them, Mrs. Hume has the rare power
of arousing enthusiasm in her auditors, and
her eloquence' was productive iof rich results
to-day.
In a few graceful words she alluded to the.
twenty-nine years of splendid work ! done by
the dub, to the founders "who bullded better
than they knrw," and to tnose who are still
working heart and soul for the welfare of the
society. Then she touched upon the "aloof
ness" that characterized a rew, and wound up
by an intenee appeal to all members to work
together.
"The directors, of course, must bear the
brunt of service," she said, "but each indi
vidual haa her own part to do." Then she
told the story of the colored girl who wanted
her mistress to write a love-letter for her,
"Just like she wrote to her own beau." 6ho
didn't much care what was said, but. she
thought "notwithstanding" was a mighty
pretty word and would sne pjease get that in
some way.
Then Ehe. continued:- "There's 'a, . mighty
pretty word' that I would like to -work in to
my talk to you to-day â it stands for a mighty
pretty sentiment that I snouid like to seÂ« im
planted In the mind and heart of every membor
of Ebell. and that is loyalty. It Is an ad
mirable quality. Every manifestation of it en
nobles the individual and strengthens the so
ciety. Without It no nation could endure â
without loyalty the most perfect organization
in the world becomes ineffectual. This is what
you owe to your club. ,
"It is not possible for fevery woman to par
ticipate In the actual work^sjf the elob. but
one may find ample opportunity to exercise
loyalty and she will not have to seek for op
portunities, either.". : .
The president's remarks were greeted ' with
warm approval and then & list of subscribers
to clubhouse stock was read, the sum amount
ing to about $4000. Calls were made for more
names to be added to the list, and soon sev
eral were on . their feet, making their little
speeches that meant new stories to the founda
tion of the contemplated building, lira, Wll
li&m li. Davis started the ball rolling with a
generous subscription and in half an hour sev
rral hundreds had been added to the sum al
ready named. Stock In tha new clubhouse Is $1

Berkeley. Bull reported that Chase
had not! complied with the order, of
the Trustees directing that sheds In

the Trustees allow him to -leave the
property as it stood until six months

would tear down all the structures and
put a- modern business block in '"\u25a0 their

fireman crawled across them with a hose he
would fall through. I am tired of having my
men Injured in that manner. "One shed is full
of hay and other inflammable rubbish and is a
menace to adjoining- property. I â¢ have been
trying to get Mr. Chase to clean out this prop,
erty for a year past, but hÂ» has done nothing.
Chase tried to reply to Chief Ken
ney, but the head. of the Fire Depart
ment would allow no denials. Presi
dent Rlckard was compelled- to rap
loudly for order to avert further trou
ble. f
In conclusion Chief Kenney said that
many rich men of Berkeley laughed at
the law and refused to observe the flre
ordinances. He said .he would refuse
to remain at the head of. the depart

up in his efforts to enforce the law.
By a unanimous \v>tÂ» V the Trustees
directed Chase to tear down the sheds
and clean out the property, as he had
been ordered. ~

Tha fair name of our city has been assailed

LUNING SENDS
SON TO TEXAS
Millionaire Capitalist
gives Boy tfWi Whom He
Has Long Been Estranged
:\u25a0; OAKLAND, Dec. 12.â Learning that the
hand of ' the "great white plague", had
been laid upon his son, and that after .. a"
stniggle:of more than a year, to support
himself and hia young wife -by his own
unaided efforts the young ' man j has been
forced to give up his v position in Seattle.,
Oscar Lnning, the well-known ; capitalist
of this city, has relented from the stand
taken by him when, displeased by j the se
cret â¢; marriage of his son to Miss Ethel
Haas, the daughter of Mrs. F.L . Button,
in ; June, â¢ 1904, he declared that he would
never allow.; the young man to enter his
honse again;' 1 - '\u0084 ;\u25a0
Father and son are now, reconciled, and
on the ' advice of the flatter's physician
Mr. and Mrs. Luning^-rfr. have been sent
to El Paso, Tex., in the ' hope that the
young man, * aided by \u25a0 the mild, dry t cli
mate, may z shake off the dread disease
which haa marked him for a victim.
When asked this morning whether or
not the report that he had come to an
understanding with his son , was true,
Mr." Luning said : :.
"I found my son' very 111, and on the ad
vice of a physician I sent him to', ; El
Paso, as the doctor thought the" climate
there would be best for him. The boy
haa a bad attack of rheumatism and one
<5t his lungs is affected. His wife Is with"
him, for I do not think I have any right
to attempt to separate them. As for my
forgiveness, I have nothing to say. He
is my son and they are married. That is
enough.'* ; v Â«
Attorney Fred L. : Button when seen at
his office this afternoon said:
' "I cannot take the initiative in discuss
ing the subject, for Mr. Luning, is tally
conversant with the condition of aff atrs
and is at liberty to make whatever state- !
ment- f or : publication he desires. What
ever announcement he desires to make
regarding the affairs of the young people
-has my full sanction, but I shall go no
further than that. It is true that Nicho
las Luning ; and his jj wife have gone to
Texas and will remain there for some
time."
ALAMEDANS DEMAND
NAVIGABLE WATERWAY
AJLAMEDA, Dec. 12.â With the Increase
fin value and the demand for water fijpnt
age on the estuary and tho tidal canal,
the Alameda Advancement Association di
rectors believe that the . time has ar
rived when the biaf ditch connecting the
eastern end of Oakland Harbor with San
Leandro Bay should be declared a navi
gable waterway for the benefit of com :
merce. Congress has never declared the
tidal canal open ; for navigation and the
three expensive steel drawbridges across
the great ditch have never been swung
since the canal was completed. . /
It has been- decided by^ihe Alameda Ad
vancement, Association petition the
City. Trustees to take steps to have the
waterway opened, to navigation. The as
sistance of Congressman J. : H. :'\u25a0 Knowland
and ; Senator George \G. â¢ "â¢. Perkins will Sbo
enlisted to. accomDllsh; the desired 'end.: It
is held by -the .Advancement , Association
that the primary object of the tidal canal
â¢was to foster : commerce on the estuary,
and give access from that body of water
to the wide reaches of San Leandro Bay,
and not for the single purpose of flushing
the channels of, Oakland â¢\u25a0 Harbor. With
tho tidal canal opened to navigation. It
is asserted that there would be a notable
advance in the value of water frontage In
the northeastern section of the city and
on San Leandro Bay.

STUDENT COX
IS ACQUITTED
Palo Alto Officers Fail to
Prove That Stanford Man
Took Part in Kongli House
Special Dispatch to Tlie Call.
PALO ALTO. Dec. 12.â Determined that
the peace of Palo Alto shall not be broken
through the leniency of the police to
Stanford students, townspeople attended
the trial of A. B. Cox, the student ac
cused of taking part in the riot, at Mul
len's Theater recently. Then* prejudice
had little effect, for the Jury acquitted
Cox.
Peter Mullen, owner of the theater, tes
tified that the "rough-house was offensive
to him, the audience and hia neighbors."
He was present, but did not see Cox do j
anything to incite a riot.
"To hâ l with you,' was the response
I received from Cox when I told him to
keep quiet," asserted Policeman Hill on I
the stand> Hill also, claimed that Cox
wasr making an unseemly noise and |
"joshing" the actors.
Cox claimed that he tried to- make the
students keep silence, but his testimony
was rendered ineffective by District At
torney C.oolidge citing evidence of others
to prove that Cox's efforts "sounded like
he was talking to himself."
The trial, beginning at 10 a. m., was
attended by 300 university men, and sev
eral times during its progress Bailiff Grt
der threatened to clear the court because
of their laughter at the testimony.
The witnesses were Peter Mullen, own
er of the theater; Policeman Hilland,
Deputy Smith, H. G. Holcomb. 1* R.

Is Enthusiastic About the
Island He Has Governed
TO BJECEIYE EEPAIBS
Navy Transport Supply That
Arrived Monday Night Goes
to Mare Island To-Day
ThÂ« United States n*vy transport
Bupply, Captain George L. Dyer in
command, arrived late Monday evening
after an uneventful voyage from Guam,
where, since January, 1903, Commander
Dyer has been naval governor. Mrs.
Dyer and two daughters were passen
gers on the Supply.
Commander Dyer is as enthusiastic
s.s a promotion committee about the
island over which he so recently did
t&Â« railing for Uncle Sam.. Mrs. Dyer
declares that the commander's friends
In the Cast should be warned* before his
arrival there to avoid the subject of
Guam, unless they are prepared to
abandon conversation for the ex-gov
ernor's monologue.
The commander of the Supply de
clares that he enjoyed every hour of
bis reign as a tropical ruler and ex
presses himself as well pleased with
affairs as they were in Guam when he
left there. Commander Dyer won the
regard of the people he governed and
when he left was given a royal "send
*ff. M Seven hundred school children
assembled to bid him good-by and it
was along a path strewn with flowers
that the retiring governor walked to
hlÂ« launch. A. salute of seventeen guns
was fired from a shore battery as the
Supply started from Guam.
Dyer will be relieved here by Com
mander Templln M. Potts, who will as
tunt the governorship of Guam when
be arrives there on the Supply. Lieu
tenant L. W. McNamee, now acting
governor, will continue to rule until
Potts relieves him.
M. R. Norton, a corporal in the
fclarine Corps, died on board the Sup
ply two days after leaving Guam. Nor
ton had married a native woman. He
was sick when he left the Island, but
It . was not supposed that his illness
would prove fatal. He was coming
tome for treatment and had intended
to ask permission from the navy de
. partment to return to Guam and there
live the rest of his days with his dusky
bride. But he died.
.â¢ In addition to Mrs. Dyer and her two
daughters, there were only two other
passengers on the Supply. They were
â¢Mrs. Holmes, wife of a navy pay clerk,

IGNORANCE PLEA
IS OVERWORKED
U.S. District Attorney's Of
fice Is AVithout Hope of
Convicting Scandinavians
FEDERAL JUKEES WEONG
Panels Drawn From Near-
By Places and Not From
Body of the District
Dlscourag'ement broods over the offloe
of the United States District, Attorney,
because of the failure : of two! Federal
juries to convict in fraudulent naturali
zation cases in the United ! ; States Tt\Â£
trict Court, and as a consequence
Assistant United States District; Attorney,
Frank A. Duryea entered a dismissal yes
terday morning of the 'charge of perjury
against Carl H. . Rasmussen," a â¢ seaf arÂ£
; ing man. Rasmussen ; had \u25a0\u25a0 admitted to
i the United States Secret Service ; people
that he knew, that his naturalization
had been effected by means of fraud.
Mr. Duryea said; afterward that he
had been unable to secure any evidence
that would offset the 'i plea of ; invincible
ignorance usually ; made < by/ Swedes,'
Danes and ;; Norwegians when accused
of the crime. , Thus far; the- Federal
Juries seem to disregard the sworn con
fession of guilt made by the def endants
themselves and accept the ; ignorance
plea too readily. The Secret Service
people say that an anomalous condition
exists here, so far as the- Jury panels
are concerned, in that nearly all the
jurors; are residents *of San - Francisco,
with a very sparse scattering from
Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley, all
Seaboard towns, - instead of being drawn
from all parts of the district, . as . is ; the
case in New York arid elsewhere. -San
Francisco business men are too often
in close relations with shipping and
seafaring persons, and their Interests
are very often bound together, so that
it-is difficult to obtain juries that will
convict a mate or master of fraudulent
naturalization.
An illustration- of this defect In the
manner of relecting jury panels "was
observed yesterday in the United States
District Court when W. Boole,- a
shipbuilder, begged off from service on
the jury to try John Francis Green for
perjury, assigning as a reason that If
he should vote . for the conviction of a
Scandinavian for false' naturalization
his business Would b^-injured. Green is
an Irishman, not a Scandinavian, but
the excuse was good and Mr. BoolÂ© was
allowed to go. v .
A short time ago Ehrich H. W. Bluhm
surrendered his naturalization/ papers
to United States Secret Service "Agent
John H. Helms and also his ; seagoing
license, after swearing to . an affidavit
that his naturalization' *liad been se-.
cured by means of perjury and :fraud.
Yesterday he appeared before Superior
Judge Lawlor and asked â¢ to be renat
uralized. Judge Lawlor declined 'to ac
commodate him unless upon -the recom :
mendation of United States; Secret-Ser
vice Agent Richard H. Taylor. When
Taylor heard of the matter he refused
point blank to makeany'-such recom
mendation or to aid and "abet* in any
other way the renaturalization of
Bluhm. Bluhm admitted in anaffldavit
to United States Local Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger/ that he had given them arid
sworn! to a" list- of ? vessels on^ which^he
claimed to " have served,*- whereas, * In
fact, he had never been : on- board .of
one of them. â¢ He-was naturalized; by
Judge Lawlor on March 12, ; 1900, his
witnesses being Arthur Rose and ; John
Henry Helms of R5 Elgin Park, a' police
officer, now. absent. Helms admitted in;
an affidavit to United States Secret Ser
vice Agent Helms that he had knowing
ly committed perjury- when he -swore
that he had known Bluhm; for five
years, and , : that the first time he saw
Bluhm was in IS9B, on the American
steamer Acapulco. .- He admitted';'. that
he h^|. perjured himself in order to
save Bluhm, who was a friend of his.
The trial; of John Francis Green for
perjury was begun before a jury yes
terday'in the United States -District
Court Green is i/riatlve of Ireland. : It
is charged that he was fraudulently
naturalized on November 8,; 1900,; and
that he committed /perjury .-'-'before
United States ! ; Local Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger- to obtain a chief mate's
license to serve on American vessels.

MILK QUESTION
IS DISCUSSED
State Veterinarians Suggest
Uniform Laws Throughout
the Coast on the Subject
SUCCESS IN THE SOUTH
Death Bate Among Children
Is deduced 25 Per Cent
in Los Angeles County
"The death rate . among: children has
been "reduced ; 26; per cent in Los An
greles; and adjoining- counties by ithe
rigid enforcement 'of the southern or
dinances covering the inspection of
milk." -~ This statement.-w as made by
Dr.; W. E.rD. Morrison, Assistant Stata
.Veterinarian, yesterday ' at .the- second
"annual meeting of ; the â¢ California Live
stock? Sanitary Association at tho Pal
ace' Hotel.' -
;;The; association is made up of the
veterinary.-, officials . of . the various
counties the - State and its
object Is I to- assist in ' stamping . out
contagious diseases ' among cattle.
Much. of the time of the meetine yes
terday was taken up with; a dissua
sion of anthrax; among cattle and
scab among -/sheep.'. . \u25a0-â¢,\u25a0
': : ~\ Dr. Morrison, who read . ah interest
ing paper,^ on /'Duties of County Live
stock /Inspectors, and the ; Best Meth
ods of ; Carrying on the Work," took a
prominent 'part in the discussion* of t.le
various papers. Pie recommended a
strict law regarding milk inspection
and the immediate; cancellation of the
licenses' of :' men ? who \ ifs _pro
vlsions. The law he recommends pro
hibits the sale of milk by a dairyman
unless his i cows have ; been tested and
unless the I milk comes up to the re
quired standard. In the south, he
said/ the custom was to impose a fine
for the first: infraction of the law and
to revoke the license upon the second
offense.'
UNIFORM ORDINANCE. ',
He suggested a uniform ordinance
throughout the State and; believes its
influence would be felt immediately.
He attacked present sheep law,
under.vwhich shepherds, and not quali-'
fled veterinarians, may pass upon the
condition, of diseased sheep.
. Dr. Work of Berekeley reported that
the; Oakland authorities maintain a
strict watch over both the milk and the
dairies. Berkeley,' he said," was not so
strict, many diseased cows being kept
in dairies there.
Retiring President^ Megowan dwelt
particularly in his address to the mem
bers on the necessity of the inspection
of .milk, as it was . a disseminator of
disease! He said the question of tuber
culosis among cattle was a vital one
and that the chief duty of the associa
tion was to prevent its spread.'
Dr. F. N. Sawyer, county live stock
inspector of ; Kern County, spoke- ; on
"Tick Extermination." He said if cattle
were dipped systematically at monthly
intervals : for one year in suitable oil
it would discourage, the ticks. He said
the oil found in' the Kern fields was
too heavy. He also recommended keep
ing; cattle off infected fields for a year,
cultivating the land in the meantime
or pasturing sheep there.- . :
Dr. R. A.; Archibald, city .veterinarian
of ; Oakland, spoke on "The Use and
Abuse of Anthrax Vaccines." He held
the vaccines in use at present are
neither scientific nor efficient, and said
the existing ' conditions are ." deplorable.
He held the, sale should be â controlled
by law.' At present the 'vaccine .is
chiefly useless, as the . makers have to
send it out mild In order that it will
not kill. â¢

NO OVERHEAD TROLLEY.
pOR the present the overhead trolley is vetoed by the unani-
M mous \otc of the Supervisors. That vote has the general
*- indorsement of the people. It reflects their will and re.cords
their wish in the matter. The United Railroads are no longer in
the dark as to what the people want, nor as to the agreement be
iween the people and their official representatives.
The overhead trolley is passing away everywhere. It has'
served its purpose. In the first stage of electricity as a motive
power it played an important part. It was a long step forward.
But now it must go and join that which is superseded, and take its
place in the limbo of things obsoleted by the quick march of in
vention and improvement.
In the matter of street railways San Francisco has an enviable
record. Here the cable was first used. It made our hills accessible
and permitted their improvement as sightly places of residence.
Our topography makes the cable a permanent device here, since it
overcomes grades that electricity is not yet able to master with
safety. Our cable roads were also the first proof that underground
conduits may be used on street railways. The cable subway was
the forerunner of the underground electric trolley. It is very
proper that a city that has been the theater of such an advance in
street railroad methods shall continue to go forward, and shall
refuse to either stand still or go backward.
It is a mistake for the non-resident owners of the United
Railroads to assume that San Francisco rejects the overhead and
demands the underground trolley as an expression of hostility to
them because they are not our fellow-citizens. We believe that
during the amicable controversy over the matter some corporation
baiters have used this non-resident argument. But it is inappli
cable. The people would think just as they do if the roads were
owned at home. The vast majority of them are desirous of inviting
outside capital here, and will not oppress it, nor harass its invest
ments. The people desire to be in harmony with the owners of the
United Railroads, and do not grudge them the profit on their in
vestment. There is no lack of appreciation of the improvement
they have wrought in our surface transportation, and when they
get ready to move forward, put in the underground trolley and
make other improvements they will receive the cordial co-opera
tion of the city. i
Among these improvements is a device that^ is familiar to
Eastern people, and to our own who travel. It is an electric signal
to the motorman, operated by a push button alongside of each seat
in the car. By its use passengers signal for a stop without calling
on the conductor. It saves the time of the passengers and of the
car crew. When the United Railroads standardize the system this
p-eat convenience and others may be introduced to the satisfaction
of the public.
Concerning the immediate future, the proposition made in the
Board of Supervisors to bring representatives of the street roads
and the large and powerful improvement clubs together is excellent.-
It has a tendency to bring about a better understanding, and when
men are face to face there is no room for that long distance epithet
which has been too much used in discussion. Public opinion on
the subject is made in the improvement clubs. Their members
know the' needs and aspirations of their localities, and it will be
a useful experience for the railroad people to go out. and talk things
over. The owners of the roads have said what they want and
the people have made plain what they do not want. It is a square
head-on collision. But as the people have the power through their
representatives to accept or reject and the decision is final, it will
be seen that they have the right of way.
If the owners of the roads will take counsel of the situation
in Chicago they will be wisely guided. A defiant policy on the
part of the street railroads there, long pursued and running into
petty details, has caused a state of public exasperation that could
have been avoided by going into session with the people, talking
things over, finding out their needs and discussing face to face
the feasibility of supplying them. It will be wise not to permit
our street railroad matters to lapse into such a temper. â¢
CALIFORNIA AT PORTLAND.
THE Governor of California appointed two commissioners for
the State, to represent the whole State at the Lewis and Clark
Exposition at Portland. The Legislature appropriated a gen
ierous and sufficient sum to secure an adequate exhibit of the re
sources of the whole State, to do justice to the entire common
wealth.
The exposition is over and has passed into history. One of
the commissioners appointed by the Governor was from Los An
geles. He has returned to his home and in an interview says :
"Southern California was at all times in the lead at the. Portland
fair, and the exhibits of this section of the State were the chief
attraction." If they were, this commissioner made deliberate and
premeditated misuse of his position and of the. funds at his disposal.
If they were not, then he certifies his unfitness for any future trust
as the representative of California, by this manifestation of narrow
sectionalism.
It would be a misfortune for Southern California itself to be put
forward as all there is of the State, for it would attract attention
only to inflict disappointment. It is time to be done with this spite-.
ful spirit of detraction, that moves some people in the south to.
grossly misrepresent and falsely characterize the State of which
- they are a part. Good wine needs no tavern bush, and if their sec
tion were all that their abuse of the rest of the State implies it
would not require the ceaseless tooting and trumpeting to which
they devote their breath.
Northern California minds it only in such cases as this State
commissioner who, to help Southern California, shamelessly declares
that lie misused his office and the whole State's money to boom hiÂ£
own small section. It is said that he did the same while serving
as State Commissioner at the St. Louis Exposition. . Northern Cali
fornia is not devoted to the detraction and misrepresentation of any
section of the State, but is content to be California. The sooner that
Southern California ceases to misrepresent the State, the better it will
be for the manners and the materialities of that section.
THE FATE OF SAKHAROFF.
'T>HE hard cruelty practiced by official Russia to suppress the
I disorders caused by famine, tyranny and repression has been
* again replied to by assassination. When students in Russian
universities have exercised the right of public meeting and orderly
expression, they have been beaten by the Cossacks with whips.
When peasants have groaned aloud they have been hammered into
insensibility and their hair and beards torn out. To such treatment
there is only one answer to come from such a people, and that is
assassination. Sakharoff solicited that answer and got it.
How far astern Russia is of the world is revealed in the differ
ence between -that government and ours. Here the right of assem
bly and of free speech is guaranteed by the constitution. Americans
meet, organize, pass resolutions, discuss public men. and measures
with freedom, and their right to do so is considered essential to the
existence of the government. In Russia the exercise. of 4 the same
rights is regarded as treason to the Government, and the mouth
that utters the most harmless sentiment is smashed by a Cossack
whip. The only answer has been assassination and the bloody record
of such reprisal stretches from Tiflis to Helsingfors.
The Japanese sent students and statesmen to study the free
and constitutional governments of the world as models, and as a
result established parliamentary institutions, freedom of speech,
press and religion. Tsi An,, the , great woman who rules China, is
distributing students all over the United States- and - among the

TRANSFER PRIVIUGES.
To the Editor of The Call:
Now that the city government and
the United- Railroads are at logger
heads over the reconstruction of the
Sutter, Larkin and Ninth street lines
and the railway company may be ex
pected to offer a compromise proposi
tion, it is in order to call attention to
the need of transfer privileges between
the Larkin-street line and the Geary
street road, so , that the municipal road
on ' Geary street will have its share . of
traffic to and from the^ City Hall and
other points thereabouts.
The .United Railroads, soon after
combining, c?ut off . transfer privileges
wih the , Geary-street, road, and now
that' the city is about to run the latter
line it should secure new trangfer ar
rangements with the United Railroads
not only at Geary and Larkin streets,
but "at other, points on the line. It is
about time : that the municipality re
ceived a concession instead jof always
giving, giving, giving. ,

WEARICUS â No, learning to play a

a felony under the laws of this State,
but you may find some poor consolation
in the reflection that, the laws of â¢ man
and those of God sometimes are at vari
ance. -
ANXIOUS INQUIRERâ You are mis
taken. The handsome prize offered to
the young lady who has made a trip to

EMBRYOTIC MUSICIANâ The dear
girl who melodiously announces that
"I'm saddest when I sing" is, in that re
spect, . precisely like all of her hearers
except her paca and mamma.
STUDENTâ No, harmonious assimila
tion and placation, are' not necessarily
synonymous terms. . For instance, the
Filipinos have been harmoniously as
similated.
YOUTHFUL INNOCENCEâ There is no
iron-clad rule that you shall â¢ not speak
to a young lady before being Introduced
to herâ but has the one whom you have
in mind a big brother?
ROSEBUDâ It Is difficult to suggest
what to do when a young lady's parents
do not approve of the man of her choice;
but you might try the effect of suggest
ing that he discover a gold mine.
. "Yes, the organization is a noble one.
It teaches Its members to be kind to all

"Good! But a man who ljved nine

to all men, regardless of any order.
What is gained, by the restriction?"
"Blinks and his wife have separated."
"What was the cause?"
"She talked too much."
"But that 13 a common failing and
should not have caused separation."

BACKS A POLICY
OF PRESIDENT
Chamber of Commerce Vote
Sustains Newhall in His
Telegram to Washington
APPOINTMENT SOUGHT
Coast Representation Is
Desired if Commercial
Attaches Are Selected
President Roosevelt was assured by the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce,
through the action of the trustee* of the
chamber yesterday, of the support of the
body In his policy regarding: the regula
tion of railroad rates. Sorao days ago
President George A. Newhall of the
chamber cent the following dispatch to
President Roosevelt:
San Francisco. December 8, 1809.
President Roosevelt, Washington, D. C.:
The San Francisco Chamber or Commerce
stands for your railroad policy and wishes to
express approval of thÂ« appointment of Frank
lin K. L&nÂ« as a member of the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
GEORGE A. XEWHALJ* President.
This dispatch camÂ© before the trustees
and approval was given by the votes of
all present. /
' In addition to this transaction of lead
ing interest several public topics were
considered and were voted on. A commit
tee reported In favor of tabling the prop
osition of the Denver Chamber of Com
merce and Denver Board of Trade for a
convention to oppose tariff legislation to
admit sugar from the Philippines Into
the United States duty free. The action
suggested by the committee was taken.
Secretary Burks was appointed as a del'
egate to the counties committee meeting,
to take place at Santa Barbara next Sat
urday.
Long communications from commercial
bodies and dried fruit business houses of
California were received. Prom the com
munications it appeared that the new
German tariff on dried fruits, which will
be effective March 1, 1906, will exact the
following import duties: Dried apples,
pears, peaches and prunes, in barrels and
sacks of not less than eighty kilos each,
at the rate, of 10 marks for 100 kilos;
prunes In boxes. 15 marks per 100 kilos.
It also appeared that Germany has con
cluded a treaty with France, Italy and
Austria reducing duties on dried apples,
peaches, apricots and pears to the extent
of 4 marks per 100 kilos; also 4 marks
per 100 kilos on dried prunes In sacks and
barrels of not less than eighty kilos each;
also 5 marks per 100 kilos on dried prunes
In boxes. The dried fruit men wish the
chamber to go on record, and to commu
nicate with other commercial bodies In
California and elsewhere, as urging that
a treaty with Germany be mads similar
to the one mentioned that Germany has
concluded with other countries, on the
ground that failure to have such treaty
between Germany and the United States
would practically bar all American dried
fruits out of Germany. The chamber
took favorable action on this proposition,
and also on another relating to the sul
phuring of export fruits, requesting the
German Government to change its regu
lations to the use of a maximum of sul
phurous acid to be specified.
California, or the Pacifio Coast in case
the honor cannot be secured for this
State, wag pushed to the front to have
one of the six special commercial at
taches recommended by the Assistant
Secretary of State to be sent abroad to
promote the interests of American com
merce and manufactures in foreign lands,
and the appointment of a Pacific Coast
man to vieit Asia was particularly advo
cated.
Three new members were enrolledâ R.
L. Stephenson, E. W. Peace and Virgil G.
Bogue of the Western Pacifi*o Railroad.
COLONEL PIPPY
AS PRESIDENT
;Last night at the Union League Club
John P. Fraser, Carroll-Cook. A. H. Vail,
M. Regensberg-er, W. E. Lutz, A. C.
SchlÂ«Â»Binger and D. Duncan were chosen
as the committeo to nominate the reg
ular ticket for the annual election In
January. Club gossip is to the effect
that Colonel George H. Pippy. whoso
fourth term as president of the league
is drawing to a close, will be placed
at the head of the regular ticket for
another term. It is said that Colonel
S. J. Hendy. the first vice president and
next in order of succession, desires
Colonel Pippy to remain as chief for
another year.
The attendance of members last
night was large. Shortly after S
o'clock the president called the meet
ing to order, and Colonel Jesse B.
Fuller, secretary, read the minutes."
Nominations for the committee were
declared in order. Fifteen candidates
were proposed, and each member pres
ent voted for seven. Five candidates
were proposed to represent a coterie
In the league that favors the; transfer
of the billiard and pool tables to the
spacious room on the main floor now
used as a library. . D. Duncan was the
only one of the five elected, hence the
surmise that the plan to dislodge the
library will not prevail if the regular
ticket Is elected.
It is highly probable that a majority
of the present board of directors will
be renoininated by the regulars. Events
will determine whether an opposition
ticket will be placed in the field. Last
night' W. H. Marston. Dr. C. T. Deane
and F. W. Marston . were appointed
tellers for the nnnual election.
The Union League is in* a remarka
bly prosperous condition. Since the
club moved into its new home at the
northwest corner' of Post and Stockton
streets J35.000 has been .expended in
equipment .for the comfort and con
venience of the large " and Increasing
membership. All debts are paid, and
there remains in bank to the credit of
the league $15,000. The monthly profit
from all sources is $2000.
-.The club is now more of .a social in
stitution than a political organization,
yet itia estimated that events connect
ed with the State election of 1906 will
tend to promote tho growth f and in
fluence of the league. Under the four
successive administrations of President
Pippy the advancement of: the league
to a club of 'the first rank has been
achieved. . - - â¢ w

Mills Makes an Important
Suggestion That Finds
FuTor Without' Dissent
On motion of W. H. Mills, the Cali
fornia State Board of Trade voted yes
terday to appoint a committee to In
terest San Francisco capital in promot
ing the Industries of the Sacramento
Valley. This has special reference to
what can be accomplished through Ir
rigation of the valley. Mr. Mills said
that the absence of Irrigation prevents
development that la due. He . would
have all reliable statistics concerning
Irrigation and Irrigation systems that
have been compiled by the United
States services, the reclamation serv
ice and the Geological Survey collated
in some handy publication.
There was much capital in San Fran
cisco, he said, that did not find prof
itable employment, that could be se
cured for the betterment of the great
Sacramento Valley if the facts mak
ing such investment advisable were
rendered plain. C. M. Wooster. ArÂ»
thur R. Briggs, H. D. Loveland, T. C.
Friedlander, S. F. Booth and others
talked on this matter, and the board
approved of the idea. The committee
to undertake this work consists of
President N. P. Chipman, W. H. Mlll3
and Arthur R. Briggs.
A somewhat amusing discussion took
place relative to some statements at
tributed by a\ Southern California
newspaper to Frank Wiggins, one of
the California Commissioners to tho
Portland exposition, in which he was
represented as saying that the south
ern part of the State led the north
ern part of California in exhibits a.t
both St. Louis and Portland.
Commissioner J. A. Fllcher was pres
ent and made a statement. Ho said
that the special exhibits at Portland
were all made by the northern coun
ties. The southern end of California
did not preponderate at Portland. ; An
Anaheim paper also recently attacked
the State Board; of Trade. Manager
Brigga read a letter addressed to the
paper in question, in which he denied,
in behalf of the board, that any par
tiality was shown to tho northern
counties in the work of the board.
John P. Irish called attention to tho
fact that there were artesian wells in
the San Joaquin Valley, In seotlons
where the soil is largely alkaline, that
were running steadily. . He said that a
law, passed some years ago, provided
that all unused flowing wells should
be capped, in order that the ground
supply of water, as well as the surface
supply, might be conserved. The board
decided to take this . matter up with
the California "Water and. Forest Asso
ciation.
Manager Briggs was instructed to re
instate George A. Dennison .as. secre
tary of the board in his discretion.
Mr. Dennison served as secretary of
the California Commissioners at the St.
Louis and Portland, expositions ' and
performed meritorious work at both.
He was temporarily relieved of tho
dutie? of secretary of the Board of
Trade, to which he . will return when
the affairs of the California World's
Fair Commission are finally settled.
Manager Briggs was instructed to
find out what can be dona by the board
to promote the project of a great tour
ist hotel in Claremont, Alarneda
County, to which the support of the
Oakland Board of Trade has been lent,
for the purpose of attracting winter
tourists to Alameda County. Mr.
Steams of the Oakland Board of Trade
made a statement about the plans.

MUCH SOUOHT INFORMATION V
ABOUT BABY GRAND PIANOS. '
The Steinway Miniature is the smallest grand piano that is of
orchestral character. - 4
The demand for grand pianos has induced most makers to pro-
duce tiny "gra n d s nn â so little that they are of Â£ less value than
the upright. The size of these pianos is an accommodation to, fash-;
ionâ a fadâ that does not consider ' musical effect. Those most
competent say that when a piano is lessthan five feet ten inches in
length it ceases to be a grand piano, except in mere shape and name.
It can prove satisfactory as a \u25a0 pretty piece of furniture, but not as a
THE .STEINWAY
MINIATURE GRAND
five feet ten inches long, has all the characteristics of the larger
Steinway grands, only, of less volume. It is a real grand piano;
and the only grand piano that is smaller than the large grand which it is
safe to buy, if^you would obtain the best musical effects. Remember,
the size of the Miniature grand is five feet ten inchesT- Gome in arid

makes nothing, smaller. .

FINDS SHORTAGE
DID NOT EXIST
Chief Deputy Treasurer Per
kins Ascertains Deficit â¢of
$1000 Is Only Apparent
MISSING COIN LOCATED
Money Had Been Put in the
Moint Custody Vaults but
Belonged to Cash Balance
Chief Deputy Treasurer Perkins ex
perienced quite a scare last Friday
when he made the- rather startling^^dis
covery that there was ..an apparent
shortage of $1000 in bis cash on hand
at the close of the day's business. \u25a0;'.-'.
Perkins looked high and low for the
$1000 without success and he reported
the matter to Treasurer McDougald,
who said the money would have to be
replaced. Perkins did not have v the
ready cash to make,the : amount good,
but he telephoned to his friend, Holla
V. Watt, who at once forwarded to him
a check, made payable to the * order
of Treasurer McDougald. -
The shortage, if any there "was, was
therefore made good, but Perkins was
not satisfied. He lay awake Saturday
and Sunday nights cudgeling his brain
as to where the missing $1000 could
possibly be. He thought of -many
ways in which the money might have
been mislaid or credited to the wrong
fund, but failed to solve the mystery.
Finally it dawned on Perkins that
there might be an overplus 'In the
money on deposit in the Joint custody
safe. This safe can only be opened by
the Auditor and Treasurer simultane
ously and Deputy Auditor Wentworth
was pressed into service to help locate
the money. In making up Saturday's
balance the sum of $278,000 Was, cred
ited to the currency deposited in the
joint custody safe. Perkins was agree
ably surprised yesterday to find that
the actual amount of currency totaled
up $279,000, which accounted for the
much desired and missing $1000.
To make sure, however, Perkins and
Wentworth checked and recnecked ail
the funds calling for cash balances and
it â¢ was ascertained beyond a doubt
that the supposedly missing money had
been located. The package of $1000
in bills had, through Inadvertence,
been placed in the joint custody vault,
having been taken from the counter on
which the'day's current funds had been
laid, where it really belonged. Need
less to state, Perkins, cheerfully re
turned the check for $1000 which had
been given to him by Rolla V. Watt.

Reuben H. Lloyd was again on the stand

explained to Mrs. ' Sharp \that she could not
leave $200,000 to him and Adolph Spreckels
In their capacity as Park Commissioners for
the erection of a memorial entrance to Golden
Gate Park. However, the sum was left to him
and Mr. Spreckels, and subsequently to the
death of Mrs. Sharp they decided to erect the
memorial entrance with the funds that came to
them in her will.. In this way alone, said Mr.
Lloyd," would the bequest to him be legal, for

NEALON, A 6o TO I CHANCE,
HAS TOCOLAW DRIVING.
Four Choices Reach
Wire . First at
Ingleside.
Special Purse for
Bearcatcher and
Cruzados.
Future engagements prevented Cruza
floe, the star of the Baldwin stable, from
appearing as a starter in the Ben Strome
handicap yesterday at Ingleside track.
This left the field clear for Tocolaw, and
Jasper Madison's chestnut sprinter went
to the barrier an even money chance.
Tocolaw won all right, but the surprise
of thÂ« race was furnished by Nealon.
Sixty to one could be obtained about Bar
ney Schreiber's 2-year-old, and in a driv
ing finish the youngster only lost by a
neck, McÃride r&lpa-bly outfinishing RicÂ«.
Red Leaf, from the Keene stable, ran
a close third. The track was deep al
most as a plowed field, which the time,
3:J4?4. would indicate.
Nearly every winner received 6turdy
support, and the ring received a wallop
ing. Four purses fell to favorites.
Thirteen started In the Introductory
maiden 2-year-old scramble, with Del
Fountain's Merry Go Round going to the
post favorite over Captain Burnett and
Frolic. For a time It looked as If the
latter would win easily with a command-
Ing lead out In front, but he collapsed in
the stretch. Lloyd Fountain brought tne
favorite op at the close In time to re
ceive a nose decision over Captain Bur
nett, the mount of Knapp. Rotron, a 20
to shot, ran third.
Enough money waa shoved Into the
rJng to back Peter J from 6 down to
2>4 to 1 favoritism, and the gelding de
feated a big bunch of sprinters in the
five and a half furlong selling event.
He had Iva Powell in the saddle, -and
â¢won cleverly from Aunt PpUy and
Hipponax. Dr. Scharff quit after being
prominent for some time.
If there wae one horse that seemed
to etand out it was Dargin. one of the
â¢leven starters in the five and a half
furlong purse number, and he was
beaten. Barney Schrciber's four-year
old displayed speed, but not in suffi
cient quantities to down Sad Sam and
Koya.l Rogue. Powell also piloted the
former eprinter and in a long hard
drive the half-bred lowered the colors
of Royal Rogue by a head. Dargin
finished third, a scant half length
farther back.
With McÃride instead of Tommy
Clark in the saddle, Fastoso, favorite
for the mile and a sixteenth selling fix
ture, ran a vastly improved race. The
Baldwin horse was never worse than
third and in a driving finish, disposed
of Rey Dare by half a length. Fountain
landed 111 Caul Cap in the show.
Capt. Rice"s Rightful, a 4 to 1
chance, led from start to finish in the
mile and a sixteenth purse run. Nig
rette. the extensively backed favorite,
finished second, less than a length in
advance of Gorgalette.
XOTES OF THE TRACK.
Iva Powell piloted the winners of the
second and third events. McÃride also
had two \u25a0winning 1 mounts to his credit.
Ike Hakelberg, a member of the gov
erning board of the Metropolitan Turf
Association, Is here on his annual vaca
tion.
Prior to the racing yesterday Jockey
Herman Radtke was the recipient of a
handsome fioral piece, the gift of Mr.
and Mrs. Cliff W. Grant of La.tor.la.
Del Fountain is now the owner of
Birdie P and David. Boland, having
purchased the two horses , at private
sale.
Radtke ard Starter Jake Holtman
had another tilt yesterday. The jockey
did not conduct himself becomingly
tvhSle at the post In the handicap on
Rod Leaf, and was fined $50. The Keene
pilot secured a two days' suspension
only last Saturday from the starter.
The annual sale of Antrim Stock
Farm yearlings, of which the veteran
horseman Chas. Kerr is proprietor, will

evening next. There are a dozen In all,

The fame of Bearcatcher and Cruz
ados, it would appear, has reached
Ascot Park, as Manager Brooks wired
yesterday that . he would hang up a
12500 purse' for a six furlong sprint If
If the two stars would Journey south
and meet Handzarra. . Too late. After
considerable . haggling' on tbe . part of
Trainer Tom Cooke and Garnet Fer
guson, owner of Bearcatcher,' as to the
distance, the latter let down a point
and the two fastest sprinters In the
West will meet next Saturday at five
and a half furlongs, each to carry 112
pounds. President Williams announced
last night that the association would
hang up $1500, which was satisfactory
to all.. This In addition to the other
attractions will furnish one of the most
brilliant cards ever offered by the New
California Jockey Club. On the same
day will be run the / Pacific-Union

erosity of the club members, have been

fered as to their disposal. It was final-
Ily decided to raffle them. Five hun
dred tickets will be printed at Â»1 00
each. They will be open to purchase by
all anglers.
The prizes for the season's competi
tion at Stow Lake were distributed.

GAUCER Df CUSTOMS SERVICE
Will Fill Vacancy Caused by Death of
J. W. Probasco, Who Ilml Held
\u25a0 Place Forty Years. â
F. S. ;Stratton. Collector of Cus
toms for the port - of San Fran-"
Cisco, has appointed James D. TVhalen
gauger, to fill the vacancy recently
caused by the death of J. "W. Probasco.
The latter held the position for forty
years and discharged the duties of the
responsible office in a manner that
elicited many expressions of confidence
In his ability, and integrity. There
were many candidates for the place
made vacant by Mr. Probasco's death.
The new gauger was an examiner at
a salary of $1600 per annum. He Is
well known in the city, having served
one â¢ terra as president of the Toungr
Men's Institute. The salary attaching
to the office of gauger Is $2400 per
year. The office Is under civil service
classification and 'may therefore be re
garded as a -life position.
State Senator E. F. "Woodward of
Santa Rosa, secretary of the Repub
lican State Committee, . was* at the Pal
ace Hotel yesterday. Gossip in politi
cal circles Is to , the effect that Sen
ator "Woodward's nomination for the
office of Surveyor of Customs, port of
San Francisco, to succeed- Joseph S.
Spear Jr., will be sent to the Senate by
the Presldent'some day this week. Mr.
Spear has . held ; the office of Surveyor
for eight consecutive years. President
McKlnley^-and Mark Hanna had singled
out Mr. Spear for Collector- of the
Port, but Senator Perkins so earnestly
favored the late Colonel J. P. Jackson
for -Collector that President McKlnley
advised Mr. Spear to select some other
position, indicating that the latter
could . have his choice of remaining
places. Mr. Spear selected the office
of Surveyor and was duly appointed.

CLEVER BOXERS
AGREE TO MEET
Champion Joe Gans Concedes
Weight to Mike (Twin)
Sullivan to Secure Bout
LEVY LANDS TKE MATCH
Affair Promises to Be One
of the Most Interest
ing Held Here in Years
Manager Morris Levy of the Hayes Val
ley Athletic Club has finally landed the
match between Champion Joe Gans and
Mike (Twin) Sullivan. The clever boxers
will meet next month in Woodward's Pj * A
villon. They will weigh In at 142 poundifl
a figure named by Sullivan, which thus]
stamps him a full-fledged welterweight.
From the time negotiations were com
menced Gans held out for 133 pounds at
6 o'clock. Sullivan shows he has beea
seeking advertising In challenging Nel
son, whom he knows will not fight at
anything but 133 pounds.
Sullivan' will train at San Rafael, while
Gans will establish his quarters at Croll'a
Gardens, Alameda. The fighters' share
of the receipts will be divided 60 per cent
to the winner and *> per cent to the
loser. The affair will be 'chiefly Interest-
Ing In deciding whether Joe Gans can
still hold bis own in the ring.
Gans gives the following opinion on
the Fltzsimmons-O'Brien fight:
"I have visited Fltzsimmons* , tralnlnsr
quarters and also Jack O'Brien's- My
choice is Fltzsimmons. I like him be
cause he is aggressive, has the punch
and 13 fairly clever. Now 83 to hla age.
Hl3 physical condition and his gymna
sium work show he is still a good man.
I believe It will take a much rougher
boxer than O'Brien to take Fltz's meas
ure. He has, been defeated by but one
man, who now stands in a class ail alone.
O'Brien is a clever boxer, but he has not
the punch. When Fltz fought George
Gardner his feet were in a bad condi
tion, which kept him from training prop
erly. At that, the old maji stalled Gard
ner off for twenty rounds , and secured
the decision. I expect It to be a good
bout."

"SLEEP" M-iXJUXCS HACK
SUCCUMBS TO VICISSITUDES
Well : Known Kenrny Street \>hlclÂ«
Damajcd by Smsxb-np Fi.ll.nre.l
"Sleep" Manning's hack, which has for many
years , ornamented the corner of Washington
and Kearny streets, has almost become a
thing of the past. Its dissolution practically
took plac* on Monday night, when it felt to
pieces at the corner of Clay and Kearny
streets as "Sleep" was tearing down the street
at a breakneck speed, racing with an automo
bile.
When the "bustup" came "Sleep" bauled
the remains up against the sidewalk wtth thÂ«
Idea of . removing them, at some future date.
Last night a party of soldiers who had been
imbibing tbe grape julcÂ« of the Barbary Coast
happened along. The deserted cab ' was fruit
for them. At first they thought they would
haul Its remains away and dump- It into thÂ«
bay from, the Presidio dock. On sÂ«cond con
Â»tde.ratlon they decided that they would burn
it up. Torches were applied and soon the old
vehicle was In a mass of flames..
Officer Connelly, who happened to bÂ» passing
at the time, rushed to the rescue and with thÂ«
assistance of a gang of passersby organized Â«|
bucket brigade squelched the flames. * * <

DIES OF STARVATION
EATHER THAN BEG
Sa<l Life of "Man Witif pc
Mask" Coiries to aii.
, â¢ End.-
LOS - ANGELES, ' Dec 12.â A* man \ who
gave : his: name \u25a0: as Frank -Wetherby fand
admitted that that- was not r-his \u25a0 true
name' died 'at 'the- County. Hospital to-day
of k starvation. How, long v h_e .f.tiad { lived
.without eating no one; knows/ but \u25a0 he:de
liberately refrained from eating.;that;be
ing; his. way of ' committing ; suicide. ;'
< A sadder life and fate X than ihis .would
be \u25a0 hard to imagine. He had \ lived in one
room in â¢â¢an - East . Third street - rooming
house"!for two years, -never having a
caller^ and seldom; venturing^out^ "Three
years " ago he came here from , Kentucky,"
and a' month later, was caught in a' gaso
line \ explosion,- which" burned his â¢ face ; in
sueh ' a "; frightful manner \ that: it bore â¢ lit
tle resemblance ' to a "â¢ human , countenance.
For a year he was in ; a 7 hospital,^ and
when he left it he was obliged to wear a
mask. People "stared at, him , on 'the
streets, and being of a sensitive mature
the unfortunate man sought seclusion and
became practically? a hermit ? ln his l own
room. He had about $1000 in bank,, and as
longaa it lasted he used it, but when his
money \u25a0 was gone ; he rdeclared \ he i would
[not > become a- public â¢\u25a0 charge, and v rather
than beg j food he went without It. He
was ; discovered Saturday . In his room too
weak. to leave his bed. At the hospital
he refused food, and hlÂ» death* followed.
Before he died he stated 1 that he had a
number of well-to-do relatives -In " Ken
tucky, - but refused to tell who they are.
SOXS AND DAUGHTERS OF
BUCKEYE STATE IN BAIfftUET
Ohionns Hold Their Annual Dinner and
Listen to Man y Eloquent
Speeches. HEhI
; The .Ohio Society of California held Its an
nual dinner In the banquet room of .the Union
League/ Club last evening. The sons . and
daughters of the. Buckeye State, /present to the
number of 150, Glorified : their birthplace by a
serious discussion of delicate viands, alter
nated with speeches, and had a pleasant time.
Three long tables were laid along the lengtn
of the hall, a fourth Intersecting them at the
head. At this last table sat Toastmaster ,W.
H. Jordan, the president of . the society, and
the principal speakers. The tables were banked
with . flowers," and this, with' the '- surrounding
shimmer. of the ladies' gowns and the black of
men's clothes, made a pretty play of color.
Otto Wise, in responding id the toast. Civ
ilization's Debt to Ohio," made the hit of the
evening. HÂ« took rather an Ironical view.: HÂ«
described Ohio as "bounded on the _ north by
the ! fusltlves of Canada, on .the south by thÂ»
clear, sparkling -waters of the Ohio River, jep
arating the State from the distilleries of Ken
tucky, and on the east by; the Steel Corpora

SAYS WILL OF SISTER
WAS LEGALLY CANCELED
\ contest to the will of the late Mrs. Emma
R Lorlng, who died In June, 11)03, leaving
an estate -valued at $2 1. C00. was . filed y*ster
day by Mrs.' Johanna Reeder. who asserts that
she was a sister of the deceased. In her peti
tion for the revocation of the will Mrs. Reeder
asks that the letters testamentary issued to
Martin Hegensberger be set aside. The will
Is contested on the alleged ground. that It was
canceled by Mrs. Lorlni: come years prior to
her death. , . \u25a0 , \u25a0 ....
\u25a0 The â¢. will \u25a0 In . ouestlon was executed in 1SÂ»Â«.
The tfstatrix made the following â¢disposition
of her- estate: *-"'>.'
"To my mother, - with forgiveness and par
don for all wrongs, !?500; to my sister. Johanna
Rieder (evidently ihe plaintiff In' the,- cod:
test, though the name is differently spelled).
$250; ta my dear Aunt Friederlcke Maria Mau
of Hamburg Germany. $2000 In trust, she to
derive the interest from such sum ' during her
life; the sum to co upon her death to my
daughter, Emma May.Loring. The residue of
my estate I leavc^to- my. daughter, the same
to be held In trust by James R..Keane, of New
York, Robert 'O. Oakley; and Martlo Regens
berger until my daughter shall . have reached
her twenty-first birthday." /
Across -the slgnaturcof the will and across
the first page Is written: "This will is can
celed October 11/1895.". It 'is the contention
of the contestant that ; this cancellation was
penned, by Mrs. . Lorlng and that It :. was .her
intention and .that legally she did cancel the
Instrument.
The contest will be heard by Judge Murasky
on December' 23. Â»: .

EXPEUT TALKS ABOUT
SPEINU VALLEY BATES
/ John Henry Dockweilcr, city expert in
ttie Spring Valley water case, testified
yesterday before United States Commis
sioner Heacock. Ile^ put in evidence a ta
:ble"showing that the water company had
borrowed "and loaned money at much less
than the rates which it testified It Jiad
paid its. stockholders. Another table was
submitted ? showing that ; the stockholders
since the foundation of the company have
received $11,907,115 more than they .would
have received , on . their -money at current
savings bank "rates, ; and . that in 1903, \ the
year involved .in !thc suit; they received
more than $421,144 ; 0f what they would
have 'gained 'if every dollar of capital in
vested by the stockholders had been de
posited ;in savings banks.
>l n : 1903 ,the average rate of interest on
commercial loans : was 4.3 per. cent, in
stead of 6 per cent," as testified to by. the
Spring s Valley '\u25a0 witnesses. : - air." Dockweiler
testified 'further -that '\u25a0 in . IDOS the Spring
Valley Water .Worksâ which has claimed
that it could not ' pay; dividends under the
ratesâ has -paid a debt to the Hibernia
Savings and I^oan ; Society of . $265,000 and
deposited in; the Bank of,California.s2so,
000 at 3 per, cent, and loaned $250,000 to the
telephone 'company at 4 per cent. .
The'next table introduced by Mr. Dock
weiler ; showed \u25a0 that 43.94 " per : cent, of all
stocks'of frailroads ; in the United States
paid no' dividends fin 1 1903: > that 56.06 . per
cent "paid"an average .^dividend of :'3.19 per
"cent; 1n' 1902 the average rate of dividend
was 3 7 per cent. Another table ; shows
that^thc rate \u25a0 paid . by" the water company
in' dividends: from IS63 ' to ': 1903 was vastly
in excess of the irate- paid .by thejcom^;

SAURET STIRS
AUDIENCE TO
ENTHUSIASM
Buy her" a seat for. 1 Sauret's next re
citalâ-never mind the rose-point mou
choJr.' "When that and Christmas are
with the snows of yesteryear a bit of
jeweled Saint-Saens as this man plays
him will still be a living Joy. They
say It is twenty-five years ago since
Sauretwas here, when, with Oscar Weil
and Mr. Hufschmidt, there was some
quartet playing done. Last night M.
Sauret returned with Arthur Speed, an
English pianist, to give the ftrst of
three recitals of the week at Lyric
HalL There was half a house, mostly
fiddlers; therefore mostly noise and
Joy. In fact. M. Saurefs appearance
may very freely be said to havo cre
ated a' furor. Even the icicles hang-
Ing from the roof failed to refrigerate
the enthusiasm; our palms wore .as
red "as our noses.
'What M. Sauret was twenty-flve
years ago Mr. Oscar Well, who played
with him here in quartet, knows. I
know not. He is to-day possibly the
most brilliant violinist of recent ac
quaintance here. A wonderful wee
thing ia the fiddle! M. Sauret speaks
Frenoh with it as purely as De Pach
mann, speaks Polish In his Chopin. He
is essentially French, finished, polished,
brilliant and aristocratic; his phrase aa
magnificently lucid and certain as a
Flaubert's; his technique impeccable.
I: do not forget that bad trick of the
player, the rasp on the G string, but
that Is a trick, a mannerism. OnÂ« for
gives it for an otherwise lovely tone,
ranging from a big. round dramatic
note to the most caressing, coquettish
pianissimo.
Had one heard first M. Sauret's Salnt-
Saens (Rondo Capriccioso) one would
have feared for the Schumann sonata (D
major), so exquisitely of the theater, the
atrical, was the Saint-Saens. But the
purple 1 moods of the opening Schumann
movement, the gay adventuring of the
finale, the whole sonata, were given with
a 'reserve as delicate and distinguished as
the ; Saint-Saens; interpretation was char
acterized by the needful abandon and
aplomb.
Mr.Speed comes In here. He is very
much there. In' fact even to the impos
sible limit of disguising his nationality:
We don't play _ the piano well In England,
but Mr. Speed plays In German except
when it comes to Chopin. He was ad
mirably In accord with the Schumann and
throughout his accompaniment was
Stamped with flawless; sympathy and
.taste. His "Variations Serleuses" revealed
him as a soloist of large gifts, though Mr.
Speed has yet to acquire a legato, and his
tone Is somewhat sterile.
Ernst, Sauret then gave us, the F sharp
minor concerto; then the Max Bruch "Ro
manze." Just about here I think the fid
dler began to feel the quality of his audi
ence, and his audience/to feel just what
kind of fiddler they had before them.
It was a performance absolutely dis
tinguished, ' absolutely individual. It was
not for the little Sauret scherzlno that
followed that the storm broke loose. The
"Airs Rugses" 'answered It and then id.
Sauret broke loose. He did things with
the- ''Airs Russes" that- the conventional
might . not approveâ when they found
their feet in the usual place after It.
With the rest they were swept Into the
stream of its gay. brilliant, purposeful
theatricalism. ' its unashamed virtuosity.
But the Saint-Saens is where M. Sauret
"lives." To hear his polished, lucent,
aristocratic phrase, delivered in the vio
linist's polished,. lucent, aristocratic fash
ion, is to be glad to live. To-morrow night
he. plays the whole B minor concerto. It
is expected that the ensuing thaw will
reach Shasta^

GENERAL SUMMARY.
Cool and clear weather prevailed nearly all
thÂ« wc+k In the central and northern section*
and 'rusts were ot frequent occurrence. In
Southern California the weather was warm
Â£Â£Â«r and very favorai>J- for citrus fruit* and
* optiitUCiM " until gainixlay^ wben tfcc
most uevere winds and sandstorms ql recent
years occurred, -continuin* through Sunday ana
causing crtat damage. . ." â¢
In the ctsiral and northern secUcns the rain
ol the preceding -week was less beneficial than
anticipated owing u> contlnucfl . cool weather
and drying wlnfis but in some districts the
; recipltatlcn was arable for present needs wid
farmers to resuir.e plowing and Eeed

Tor* favorable In the coast districts. In
Southern California the season has been un- ;
upuallj good until near the close of the pres

ihe drying winds and sandstorms have had an
injurious tfTeet on ail cro^s
It is reiorted that much damaie was done
to the criage and olive crops m Southern Cali

were broken and iiprocted. Orange picking and

fra>t v weather prevailed during the week. The
frosts In yonie places were quite heavy, but
caused no carnage to orange cr other crops. The ,
rain of the preceding week, although beneficial
-n localities -where ths precipitation was
heavy was generally Insufficient to
put ' the irround in good condition
ior plowing or to sprout Â«rarly sown grain,
-r.d patturage was not materially improved
â¢ x<*tÂ»ut in a few places. Feed is scarce and
t tock are EaffertaÃ- The soli Is very dry and

3CEW YORK Dec 12. â This" "was another
4ax at active and varied speculation 'in the
stock market, although the volume of the trad- j
I ing was not fully u,p to that of yesterday, w&icn t
'\u25a0 reached the maximum .for the season. Selling j
to realise profits was very clearly In evidence >
; at many points throushout the day. but. tms ,
: process was accomplished with good success -
: and was in fact one of the most tncourafflng ,
Incidents of tfce market- The only- decided
I breaks were at the very last. The small gen- j
I eral public share In the speculation has been ,
1 the subject of constant comment and sarcasm [
; he.s gained Torce as to the ability to dispose
i at a profit of the enormous accumulations in I
special stocks which have been made by pools 1
! and organized parties in the process of advance '
! in prices to the unprecedented levels reached: !
1 Nearly all -the stock* which made conspicuous !
1 gains yesterday Were under this realizing pro- ]
; cess to-day, feme of them opened higher and j
! maintained some part of their gains without^
extending them. Reading being a notable ex- 1
ample. In others the opening gains-, were j
yielded almost immediately, but prices I were
net allowed to recede â¢to any extent below I
last night. As sustaining forces In the market !
there was a . return to the method of furious !
activity and spectacular advances In - special ,
stocks and those selected to-day were found \u25a0
again among- the industrials in the majority of {
cases. Stocks having :o do with the various .1
metal industrials, especially copper and : Iron,
, were conspicuous. . A - substantial basis for the 1
strength in this group was the trade conditions 1
in those stocks. The market \u25a0 price of copper j
was asain advanced In this market and trade j
reports asserted that sales ?Â»Â»Â»\u25a0<< for ' many j
'months had already been made up to. the pro- j
ducU\e capacity of 'the. trade at tho pre3snt 1
profitable level of prices. The Iron and steel !
; trade also received extensive action artd dls- I
I cusslon by the presentation . ot many, detailed :
facts bearing upon! the different departments
jof that trade. If was asserted that the value
: of November exports of the : products of " the
j-Unitedj -United States Steel Corporation â¢ was the larg
! est on record, notwithstanding- the enormous
domestic demand and the high prices prevail
ing. Some of the Southern railroads having a
large Jron traffic were affected by this'move
t ment. .The corn carrying roads showed. a deâ
I gree of strength. Missouri Pacific being es
j i*ecially affected by the Missouri State corn re
port. A wide advance in the New York pub
lic-utilities was due to the views. of operators
regarding the probable outcome of the .legal j
contest over the New York election. Rates' for
money on call were decidedly easier, the rate
for renewal* ruling generally at 10 per cent or
under. This was attributed to the additional
supplies attracted to this center from ouisiJe
j source* by the profitable rates prevailing.
' Nothing occurred in the routine of the money
ra*rket to indicate- a change In the course of"
aff airs. Foreign exchange wae firm, j with the
relaxation In the money rate. There was still
large offering of ; foreign trade funds, how-.!

reported Intention to anticipate the payment
of January 1 Russian bend coupons In Berlin. -
The sub-treasury continued to take funds
from the New York market and the credit by
that institution at the clearing-house to-day
reflected a' continuance of this drain. Stocks
made a good rally from the pT<^fil-taklng early
In the last hour, but broke rather feverishly
in the final dea lines, with the violent upward

veloped to-day resulted chiefly - from a contln^

day In wettv much the., same manner as '\u25a0 It
did then. Good support was rendered at times,
but this only -served, to temporarily arrest the

ASPIRANTS ARE
STILL HOPEFUL
In addition to the large list of
"probable appointees to various mv- j
nicipal positions under the Schmitz-
Ruef regime already published by The
Call, it is understood that George Berg
| er will succeed George Benham as Chief
Deputy Tax Collector under Tax Collec
tor-elect Nichols. Benham will be
transferred to some other position of
equal dignity, probable to that of sec
retary of the Civil Service Commission
to succeed Edward Moran, who is sure
of appointment as Civil Service Com
missioner.
Benham has not given up hope that
he will be the man selected for clerk
of the Board of Supervisors, but Ed
ward Lynch seems to have the inside
track for the place with a few others
in the running, some of whom have no
chances whatever.
An interesting story revolves around
the appointment of a successor to Su
perintendent of Schools L.angdon. There
is a movement on foot to hand the
plum to School Director Rom-ovieri
with the understanding that Roncovieri
will run for the office next year. This
arrangement would suit Abe Ruef, who
sees an opportunity of shelving Ron
covieri. The latter is a bit wise him
self and it is said will not accept the
appointment unless there is a compact
to reappoint him as School Director in
the event that he fails of election for
; {superintendent of Schools at the polls.
The gossips are still liguring that
City Engineer Woodward will oe trans
; ferrcd to a membership on the Board
|Â©f Education if Roncovieri is made Su
>pcrintcndent. Otherwise Woodward can
1 be regarded as a strong candidate for
j the latter office. Woodward has a
penchant for educational affairs and
the fact that he and the members of the
Hoard of Works are not in hearty ac
cord would be an incentive for him to
hunt pastures new. " â¢ \u25a0
Frank Burke will secure a comfort
able billet under Sheriff-elect O'Neill
and It would not be surprising if Burke
is made iind<Â»r-sheriff to succeed Wil
liam Hines.
Chief Deputy Treasurer Charles B:
Perkins is likely to be retained in the
oflice, owing to his "knowledge of its
intricacies. As already stated in these
columns. Raleigh Hooe, recording sec
retary of the Board of Education, Will
be one of Treasurer-elect Bantel's dep"
"yiles and Myrtile Cerf is being con
sidered-for one of the appointments if
something else Is not provided for him.

OF VAL UABLES
ThrÂ«e men are in the City Prison
charged with grand larceny. Their names
are Harry Arnold, George Meyers and
Robert Noelke. The complaining witness
against them is Mrs. Grace Hopkins,
widow of R. A. Hopkins, District Attor
ney of Yolo County for many years prior
to his death in the Napa Asylum about
six years dgo. The prisoners are accused
of taking three diamond rings valued at
$400 and J4S in coin from Mrs. Hopkins.
Mrs. Hopkins has been employed in one
of the large department stores for the
last six months. She lives at 117 Eddy
street. She had been visiting some friends
at the Hamilton Hotel, 125 Ellis street,
on the night of December 5, and about 3
o'clock next morning, while she was on
her way home, she was approached by
the three prisoner? on Mason street,
near the Alturas Hotel. She admits that
she had been drinking wine, not wisely,
but too well. The three men took her to
several saloons in that neighborhood and
she became oblivious to her surroundings.
She awoke about noon of that day in a
room in the Linwood House, 18 Mason
street, and she discovered that her dia
mond . rings and coin had disappeared
with the three men. She says she felt as
if in a trance, and believes from the
after-effects that she bad been drugged.
She notified the police and Detectives
Ryan and ODea were detailed on the
1 ase. They were assisted in. their search
for the three men by Policeman Orr.
Noelke was arrested two nights ago and
Arnold and Meyers yesterday morning, j
The officers found that Arnold' had paid
for the room at 18 Mason street about 6
o'clock. He and Meyers came, out of the
room about an hour later and Arnold was
