Local Conference Anxiously
Watched by Officials of
All the Lines.
ThÂ«' railroad world is awaitinr with
the keenest Interest the outcome of the
conference begun in this city yesterday
> between the officials of the Southern
Pacific Company and of the San Pedro,
Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railway,
relative to the demands of the Clark
people for trackage privileges over the
lines of the Southern Pacific in Cali
fornia, Freight Traffic Manager Sproule
of the Southern Pacific, acting for
Traffic Director Stubbs of the Harri
man lines, ha 6 already refused to make
the desired concession to the Salt Lake
road, and President Harriman has sus
tained the decision cf his officials. Now
the representatives of the two lines
have come together again in this city
for the purpose of talking over the
matter. \u0084 . \j -
As to what the outcome of the meet
ing will be. those who are attending it
will not vouchsafe an opinion. It is
generally believed, however, that the
rxarrinian officials will not permit the
Clark people to enjoy an interchange
of traffic in California, and in the event
il ~a -Sat-rertita.T,'^;i hsxiloa^ht,' L';;iled
States Senator Clark and his mHlion
aire associates will either endeavor to
inaugurate a bitter railroad war in the
West. against Harriman or suffer the
humiliation of withdrawing' from the
San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake
road and leaving, the Harriman syndi
cate in absolute control. Senator
Clark's friends say he will not be
forced out by Harriman and that rather
than submit to what seems to be an
attempt to "bottle him up" in the traffic
business, he will cut loose his mil
lions in forcing Harriman to a com
promise.
CONFERENCE BEGINS HERE.
At yesterday's meeting the San
Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake road
was represented by Vice President J.
Ross Clark. Chief Counsel T. E. Gibbon
x and General Freight and Passenger
l^Agent E. W. Gillett- The Southern Pa
s cine forces consisted of Freight Traffic
Manager Sproule and Special Counsel
Peter F. Dunne, while Traffic Manager
Schumacher of the Oregon Short Line,
end J. A. Munroe, freight traffic man
ager . of : the Union Pacific, both of
â¢which lines are part of the Harriman
system, were in attendance in a sort of
advisory capacity. Quietly dictating
; the policy that the Southern Pacific
officials shall pursue at the conference.
Is the traffic director of all of the
Harriman lines, J. C. Stubbs ot Chicago.
The conference yesterday lasted many
hours, and that the officials represent-.
Â«Â» Ing the contending interests were not
enjoying the friendliest : of feeling was
evidenced in many ways, v ::
They were courteous but cool toward
each other during the meeting, and at
the nobn hour the traditional custom
among railroad officials : : of joining at
luncheon was noticeably violated, the
Clark people scurrying off to the Palace
grill, where they talked in low voices
with their legal adviser,; while the ever
emlling Sproule and likewise pleasant
faced Dunne strolled leisurely uptown to
their club. What developments took place
at yesterday's meeting is kept a secret,
as will be probably, the proceedings. ;; ;
PREDICAMENT SERIOUS, f:
Vice President J. Ross Clark did volun
teer the statement that he and his asso
ciates "hoped" for an amicable settle
ment, which is practically an admission;
and the only one so far openly made, that
trouble exists between the two roads, and
it comes as a flat contradiction to the re
cently signed statement issued in New
York by Senator Clark denying that any
differences exist between the Salt Lake
tread and the Southern Pacific Company.
Freight Traffic Manager Sproule of the
Southern Pacihc would not make any ad
mission. In fact, he would not even ad
..^tnlt that a conference was being held,
and tried to place the gathering in the
light of a casual visit from "some visit
ing officials from the south." .-" -^ ';\u25a0
That the Clark people are in a serious
predicament is generally; conceded by all
railroad men who are watching the sit
uation. Senator Clark and several of his
associates undertook the construction. of
a railroad from Salt Lake City to Los
Angeles. They, tinally achieved their am
bition, but only after they had pur
chased a portion of the Oregon Short
Line a nd secured trackage leases for
part of thoir line over portions of the
Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific roads.
While the road was In course of construc
tion E.TL Harriman, rated as one of the
ghrewdest railroad manipulators In Wall
street, became a partner in the Clark
project, and' with the Montana Senator
divided the stock 50 and 50 per cent.' Then
the Southern Pacific president persuaded
Senator Clark to enter into an agreement
that the Salt Lake road should not be
extended beyond Its original intended
terminals without the consent " of the
Southern Pacific. Eventually the Salt
Ij| Lake road was finished to San Bernar-
A/Jno and an organization partly com
pleted to secure business for the road.' j
SENATOR MAY FIGHT BACK.
The first attempt to control freight traf-
fie originating ;at California points be
yond the- rails of the. Salt Lake road, or
traffic; from the East i destined for the
same points, was met witha serious ob
stacle. "The Southern ; officials
curtly informed the Salt Lake road peo
ple that if freight ;was -to be 1 had- at
points touched by the Southern Pacific in
California,^ President did not
propose to carry: it 'i a - few miles \u25a0 to ; the
Salt Lake line and lose a profitable 1 long
haul, but would undertake to transport
it as far as possible : over, his' own rails
toward its destination. ::. . . -
If the Clark freight agents cannot go
to Fresno and pick up a carload of freight
for an .;. Eastern;' point;. ; and/ then ; run Hit
down In their own cars to; say : Barstow,
by way of the leased Santa >Fe -tracks,
where it can be transferred to the rails cf
the San Pedro, Los Angeles - and Salt
Lake Company, or deliver Eastern f reght
over the same route, it is; generally con
ceded that Senator. Clark is "out of the
transportation business bo far as Califor
nia f reieht is concerned. \u25a0-. " \
Under the ruling of the Harriman offi
cials Clark Is now in that position, and it
remains to be seen what he will do; It
has been said r that ; Senator Clark V: has
threatened to turn his' interests in the
Salt Lake road over .to the Goulds and
thereby spite Harriman; and at the same
time furnish ; the Denver "and Rio Grande
an entrance into Southern California.
SANTA FE LOOKIXG ON. L '
Clark's friends insist that if "Harrirnan
does not grant.: him; the demanded con
cessions the Senator will build a road in
California parallel >\u25a0 to the Southern \u25a0:;'\u25a0 Pa
ciflc, but:\thls predictions Is V confronted
with the fact that the^agreement entered
into between Clark, and: Harriman - spe
cifically sets; forth that, the;: Salt Lake
road shall not be extended except by con
sent, and; Harriman,' owning as much
stock as Clark, -will naturally not consent
to any addition to the Clark road that
will Jeopardize the business- of his own
lines. ; . \u25a0.-:.-:""â¢:â¢. \u25a0.-..-;;'/ ;'. v 'v \u25a0\u25a0.'-.â¢\u25a0'.. â¢\u25a0":':\u25a0'-,. :':'-y : : >'\u25a0\u25a0'
j In the present controversy;; between
Harriman and Clark the officials of the
Santa Fe road are : found in the back
ground, emlhng serenely. They, endeav
ored to get an agreement with \u25a0Harriman
for an- exchange of traffic In > ; California
but failedand finally bought the San Joa
quln Valley road and ha ve: since been ex
tending;, their lines or sending\thelr boats
to points within what was regarded as the
exclusive territory of ,- the Southern : Pa
ciflc in order; to get freight to 'their main
line. "If ; Harriman^ should concede thein
terchange of traffic demands to the Clark
road he well knows that he would imme
diately precipitate a, war: between his own
road and the Santa Fe.r Apparently he
prefers to contend with Clark and, if pos
sible, bring him to submission

Czar 1 * Martial Message to the Oren
burg (Icrsj Stirs Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG. August 1.-, Empe
ror Nicholas' martial message to the
Orenburg clergy, in which he expressed
his determination never to conclude a
peace dishonorable to Russia or un
worthy of her greatness, and which was
gazetted yesterday, is printed in every
paper in Russia to-day. It has struck a
responsive chord in many quarters, even
among the friends of peace. The Em
peior's words, however, by no means
, hear out the construction placed upon
them by the jubilant war party, nor do
they at all exclude the idea of a success
ful termination of the approaching
negotiations at Portsmouth, but they cer
tainly strengthen the militant spirit
aroused by the cabled versions of the
Sato interviews and the cold figures rep
resenting the supposed extent of the con
tribution to be demanded by Japan.
Subsequent explanations have failed to
efface this idea of oppression entirely and
many voices have been raised to urge
the Government to resist too onerous
conditions. For example, the merchants
of Moscow, who are largely old believers
and who control much of the wealth of
the nation, are sending an address to
General Linevi'^ch to express confidence
that the army will defend Russia's honor
and that a humiliating peace will not be
made.
While many Influences tending to unify
the nation, if it should be necessary to
continue the war, are evidently in opera
tion, no disposition is shown to anticipate
the result of the peace conference or to
make the task of the commissioners
more difficult and M. de Witte's appoint
ment to the mission Is regarded as proof
that a basis of peace will be found It
possible.
A Eignirlcant thing in connection
with the peace conference is the meeting
of the Emperor's chosen councilors,
twenty-two In number, representative
both of the Liberal and Conservative
schools, as well as the Ministers,
which will be held to-morrow, a day
sooner than was expected, to pass
their verdict on the national assembly
project. The deliberation probably
â¢will continue a week, perhaps longer,
but the Emperor wishes to reach a
conclusion before the birthday of
Grand Duke Alexis Nicholaivitch, heir
to the throne, August 12; and.Ta/manl
festo generally is expected on that day.
The promulgation of an acceptable re-
form â¢ project would make the accept
ance of the decision of the peace con
ference,^ either for or against peace,
much easier. "L\
President Nikitino of the St Petersf
burs Dou ma, a leading Liberfi member
of the delegation which presented the
Zcmstvo address to the Emperor, to-day,
declared that a criticism of the project
before the publication of particulars
â¢would be premature and uncalled-for-.
and that such details as the form Of
representation and the extent of sul
trage;^irere unimportant -as the repre*'
sentatives of the people themselves
would decide which form would be best
when they meet.-.

said: "It, has been intimated in this trial
that "I am after, the big fish and not the

pose of these prosecutions is to deter oth

The other three he hopes to secure in a
short tÂ»rne. Two of them .will be South-,
crn men, and both will be experts in^ cot
ton and tobacco statistics. â ."." .. V.V':, .'
This, in brief, is 'one of the ideas
which Secretary Wilson . elucidated . to"
President Roosevelt to-day. .-\u25a0\u25a0 ;t.; t .
At the conclusion of the conference
Secretary .Wilson talked frankly about'
some phases of the work, in his depart
ment.. H e was asked whether there .was
any likelihood of his early relinquishment j
of his portfolio as Secretary of Agricul
ture. He replied with a smile:;
"Do you remember the story of Andrew
Fair's service in Sir Walter Scotfs Rob
Roy? Andrew's master was going to
discharge him. In fact he told him to gO._
Andrew said: â¢ ; . ..'...'
" 'I won't go.' v . \u25a0 â¢ .. \u25a0\u25a0â¢.\u25a0\u25a0
" 'Why not?' asked the, master. / \u25a0 \~
" 'Because I won't,' replied Andrew. '.
" 'Well, you are \u25a0* discharged,' 'declared
the. master.
"'I won't go,' retorted Andrew. 'If
you don't know when you have a goo*
servant I know when I have a good mas
ter.'
--jdlne is not a precisely parallel case,";
continued the Secretary; "but it serves to
illustrate the situation. I have not been
asked to go and IÂ°am not intÂ«nding to re
sign. I am going to stick to my post and
continue to buiid up that great , depart
ment. You will recall that when I went
there I found practically nothing but a
few. roir top desks and a half-dozen,half
.starved. scientists.' Since that time .we
have, built up an Important branch .of. the
Government. Th e Agricultural Depart
ment to-day Is a great department, and,
I may say, is as sound as a nut. We are
trying every day to make it better. Since
I took charge of it 279 people have been
let out of Its service for various reasons,
many of them on charges of one kind or
another. We make It a point to . keep .
only first-class men and women. ;:. The
purpose pfÂ»the investigations' now in prog
ress is to . purge the ' department of all
seinshnesa- and corruption, a.ndÂ°thaÂ£ end
wilrf be: accomplished.' ; It Is my; purpose,':
and it \z the purpose of' the : President." -
"Have you heard anything- about Mr.
Hyde?" ' '. ".
"Well, he' has gone to Europe," re
plied , the Secretary, grimly. , "I had- no
idea he was going away from the coun
try when he left the' department. ? 'I : re<
ceived a letter fromTHrS. Hyde,"explaln
ingr that' she was responsible tt6fi "Ills'
departure ;itha,jf she Had purchasÂ§d-Â£vjpi;
self his steamship Jtransportatlbnl^nd^
had insisted ithat hei-go away.f on j ac
count of his'' health, bne said* he -was
in danger of a nervous collapse."
Concerning the inaniries now being
made as -to. the scandals by., theiDepart
ment.; of* Justice, Secretary Wilson did
not care' to-talkTi \.Â£ ', '\u25a0...', .' \ V
"Manifestly," said he, "it would
scarcely be proper for "me to discuss
the work of another department, . par
ticularly in the present circumstances.
Only two cases now are before the At
torney General . from my department,
that of Holmes and that of Dr. Moore.
What may be the result of . the in
quiries I have no idea. Dr. Moore had
accomplished some fine results, and if
he had only made clear to the depart.
ment his entire "connection- with the
Nitro-Culture Company, I , think we
could have kept him on a straight
course." . ' ..-'â¢ \u25a0 -^:'.' '- "" '\u25a0' ~â¢i
Then Secretary Wilson outlined his
new plan for tne Bureau of Crop Sta
tistics. Said he: ,
"It is my intention to create a board
with Assistant Secretary "Hays, at its
head, which shall handle all crop sta
tistics. I appointed a board a little
while ago, the members of which handle
the statistics individually and turn 1 in
their results to me or Mr. Hays.' The
present board Is a sort of. makeshift
affair. It wa3 the best we could, or
ganize in a hurry : from .people. In; the
department, . jlt 'is my intention to or
ganize a board of four men, -two Kof
whom will be from the South. The
other two: will be from other parts of
the country. Tliey will be the best
men we can findln the cbuntry-^-men'
of character, standing and education.
They will be scientific' expert's in whom
the country willi have absolute V confi
dence. All reports will- be sent to me
from the field and I will' place them at
the proper time in the hands of these
scientists. Each will make up his es
timate and the" four estimates will be
received by me or by Assistant. Secre
tary Hays. The members of the' board
will be regular employes of the depart
ment and they will spend some ortheir
time In traveling in search of -any in
formation which â¢ may bear upon their

NEW YORK. 'July 31.â The Japanese
envoys a-o not acctpt M. <!(\u25a0 Witte"s re
ported review of the situation. M. Sato,
spokesman \u25a0of the Commissioners, says
that lug understanding was that the
Portsmouth meeting was to be a confer
ence, with tht conclusion of peace as the
direct object.
"If Russia had desired to know the
Japanese term? in advance and "had asked
for theci threugh the necessary .chan
nels, I have no doubt her request would
have been complied with," said Mr. Sato.
"I do not care to discuss M. de Witte's
interview in detail, because it seems to
be 100 vague. 1 am afraid a great many
words were lost overboard. Â£ , think,
however, that there is little doubt that
11. de Witte has plenary powers, insofar
as such jwwirp are ever granted in these
day? of the cable and quk-k communica
tion with oat '*= home government. Nat
urai!y. soraa questions will arise that will
have to be submitted by M. de Witte to
his imperial master, just as it may hap
pen that liaron Komura may have to re
fer to his Majesty, the Emperor, some
question that may arise at conference.
I have no doubt, however, that, within
these limits, both commissioners -will be
endowed with power to treat for final
peace."
"And if M. de Witte has not such au
thority?" was asked.
"Then." replies Mr. Sato, "there will be
no conference, and we will go home."
An interesting sidelight upon the prob
able terms which will be proposed by the
Japanese commission was given by Ussu
jiro Ishikawa, editor of the Hochi Shlra
bun. an influential journal in Japan. Mr.
hhikawa spoke only for himself, but his
vlev.- of the situation may be accepted
as accurately reflecting the opinions of
the great masses of the Japanese people.
Said he:
"It is the general feeling of the Japan
ese that this is not the time for peaceâ
that it is tco early for peace. We must
get Harbin and Vladivostok first."
Talking of the question of Indemnity
Mr. Ishikawa said the very least amount
the Japanese expected was one billion
and a half yen. as that was the actual
cost of the v.-ar.- Some even demanded
five billions, but he thought that was too
high a figure and a moderate one would
be three billions.
Commander Kamimura, Commander
Sato and Commander Oguro of the Jap
antse navy, who are in the city on their
way Abroad to take charge of the vessel
building for the Japanese navy, were
entertained to-night at the Nippon Club.
Mr. Uchida. Consul General of Japan in
New York, and Commander Takeshita,
naval' attache at Washington, were
among the other guests. Commander
Kamimura related some of his experi
ences in the naval battle with Rojest
vonsky. Kamimura commanded tfce To
kiwa.
"I would have you know that nothing
could exceed the calm valor of the sail
ors," he said. "To you who live in for
eipn lands I would say: "Go about your
business confident in the prowess of your
soldiers and tailors. Be not anxious for
them. They are doing their best and are
sure of victory. Learn American ways
and study to make Japan a great com
mercial nation, and all will be well. Our
children will find their path all the easier
if you do your duty in one sphere; we do
ours in another, imbued with a love for
a common cause.* "

"That the defendants improperly, im
providently and -. wastefully procured
and permitted the defendant society to
loan the sum of $250,000 to the Depew
Improvement Company, a corporation
doing business in the State .of \u25a0 New
York, in which - company * the defend
ants, Chauncey M. Depew and others

ceipt by Mr. Hyde of salaries aggre
gating $27,000 annually from the Equi

Allegation is also made of the pay
ment of illegal and excessive pensions
to various persons. and of the payment
of "excessive, improper and unwarrant
ed sums to various attorneys and coun
selors at law, \ the aggregate I amount
of .which far exceeded and was entirely
disproportionate to the services ren
dered."-;/ 7 /
The complaint also charges:
"That the defendants wrongfully
caused the defendant society and a
\u25a0number of other societies and corpora
tions in which the defendant society
was largely a stockholder and In which
some of , said individual defendants
were also . stockholders,' to pay large
sums of money, to themselves, or " to
some of their number and to other per
sons under the guise of salaries and

GRAFT IN GUISE OF SALARIES.
Referring to the merger in 1&92 of the
Western National Bank of the City of
New York, in which the Equitable So
ciety was the owner of 12,000 shares,
with the National Bank -of the United
States' of New York, the complaint says
the society, received $70 in cash and $140
in stock of the Consolidated Bank in ex
change ' for each $100 par value of the
slock in the Western National Bank,
making the total amount received $210
for each share, the market value of
which at the, time was from $â¬00 to $625
per share. ..".'. Y,~
A schedule of the salaries paid dur
ing: the last five years to the principal
officers of , the society -is appended to
the complaint, which declares such sal
aries to have been largely In excess of
the .value of the services of the persons
named and that, the . payment of such
salaries resulted in substantial loss to
the society. â¢ It is also charged that, in
addition to the salaries referred to, the
individual defendants, as officers, mem
bers of committees, trustees or agents,
"permitted the defendant society to pay
to many of' the above named officers
and directors and to others large and
unwarranted sums as expenses incurred
by such persons in the service of the.
society, and said sums were paid with
out sufficient vouchers, .without proper
proof of their amounts and without it
being properly shown that the said de
fendant society in any way benefited
by such expenditures or was legally or
properly chargeable therewith."
The matter of loans to agents," which
were assigned to the Commercial Trust
Company of Philadelphia, Is -set forth,
the charge being made that for the
money advanced on such assignments 5
per cent interest was paid, while the
trust company at the same time held
large sum* of ' the society's money for
which it paid but 3 per cent Interest-
value of property belonging to the de
; fendant society."
Section 10 ; of the complaint deals with
the lease' of : premises in New York to' the
Mercantile Safe Deposit v. Company, ; the
rental of which is declared to have been
inadequate and the terms of the lease
greatly to the disadvantage of the Equi
table Society; furthermore, that James
H." Hyde, James W. Alexander. Gage E.
Tarbell and . other defendants were di
rectors in the Mercantile Safe Deposit
Company and thereby derived a profit in
violation of their duty to the Equitable
Society. Â§
Referring to. the purchase of the capi
tal stock of the ' Missouri Safe Deposit
Company, for which' the Equitable paid
$250 for each $100 par value, the eleventh
section of the complaint declares that
the Equitable . received but~ aÂ»nominal
rent- for the premises occupied by the
Safe Deposit Company; that at the time
of the stock purchase 1410 shares out or
a total of 2000 wereowned by James ,H.
Hyde and . the remainder by others of
the individual defendants, some of whom
were officers in . the Safe | Deposit Com

i "That 1 the referee's deed for said prop

frain, but said defendants have neglected
and refused to pay the amount to said :
losses,* said society had so suffered." "~^
It is -further charged that "the de
fendants wastefully. improperly and
Improvidently permitted the defendant
society for a number of years past to
| keep during almost the whole of each j
year excessive, unnecessary and un
i warranted sums of money on deooSrt
with the National Bank of Commerce.
New York; the Mercantile Trust Com
pany,. New. York; the Equitable Trust
Company. New York; the Commercial
I Trust Company. Philadelphia, and at
1 least nineteen other banks and trust
companies, in some or all of which the
individual defendants, or sets of them,
were "stockholders, directors or officers,
which sums were deposited at inade
quate rates of interest, instead of .in,- .
! vesting them in proper and more re

funds redeposlted In the depositories
from which they had been temporarily
withdrawn for this purpose."
After reciting that the society has at
the end of each year caused a balance
to be struck purporting to show tho
net surplus earned during the preced
ing year, the complaint declares that
the defendants have failed to divide .
among the policy holders an equitable
share of the net surplus at the expira
tion of each five years, as provided by
the society's charter. The complaint
continues:
"Plaintiff further alleges that the
rules and regulations adopted and here
tofore acted upon by the defendant so
ciety and its officers, with the approval
and consent of the society's directors,
for the ascertainment of the Equitable
share of the surplus due to each pol
icy holder were a4d are incorrect, llle-
gal and improper and that, of the sur
,plus now held or purporting to be held
by the defendant society, as shown by
its statements, a sum approximating
$10,000,000 is held by the society. In
which said sum the present policy hold
ers, in violation of the law and the
express terms of the charter, would
have no interest under said rules and
regulations.
"That the defendant. society and tha,;
individual defendants, as officers and &i--'
rectors thereof, have held and reported
in the reports to the tax commissioners
of the city of New York that the entire
surplus belongs to the policy holders.
"That tfre present policy holders of tha
defendant society are entitled to the
whole of the present net surplus of the
society, after deducting a sufficient
amount to cover all outstanding risks
and other obligations, in accordance
with the charter, and are entitled to
have an eauttable share of said net
surplus credited to or paid to or ap
plied for the benefit of each policy
holder, in accordance with the charter
and with law."

City free delivery has also greatly in
creased in cost; . as v -as , been . extended
to : communities that have not heretofore
enjoyed it, and enlarged in , tnose where
it has . long been : established. '
It is estimated at the department that
the; rural service- for the next year, will
involve an expenditure of at least $26,000,
000, and If the postal, business continues
as at , present the next postal deficit 'will
be much \u25a0 larger i than' the -one . now - con
fronting : the Postmaster General.âWash
ington Star..' â¢>\u25a0
According to an estimate based on re
turns for the first three-quarters of the
current-fiscal year there will be a deficit
of $15,000,000 on the books of' the postal
service on July 1., This is the biggest de
ficit" in the history of the service, ap
proached only in 18G0 and in 1895, when it
was a' little more than $10,000,QOO." The
big deficit this year is attributed |o the
unusual expenditures for rural free de
livery, amounting to" more than $22,000;000.
From 1535 to 1902 there was a steady de
cline in the excess of expenditures, over
receipts, culminating in 1002, when the
deficit "was less than , $3,000,000. In 1903,
however, the deficit again began to in
crease, as the rural free delivery service
expanded, and in â¢ 1904 it amounted to
nearly $9,000,000.'
The amount of unprofitable matter car^
rled by the railroads upon which the
Government loses large amounts annual
ly is given as an T additional < drain on the
revenues of the postal service, which was
felt more this year than at any time
heretofore. This is due to the change In
the manner of administering the star
route service. For years big contractors
controlled the star route business and
sublet the work. By this system of con
solidation they were enabled to perform
the service at a minimum of cost. Under,
the plan adopted ; a few years ago the
individual submitting a bid for the, trans
portation of 'mail on a star -route must
live on the route and do his ; own work,
and this has greatly increased the cost
of star routes, \ which 'were formerly con
tracted for by big concerns. .

Greek Writer of the Third Century De
scribes the Method
Fally.
Probably few fishermen are aware
that fly fishing dates back to classic
times. A minute description of the
artificial fly as used by Macedonian
anglers is given by Aelian. a Greek
writer of the third century A. D., as
follows:
"Between Berea and Thessalonlca
there flows a river, Astraeus by name,
and there in jt fishes of a spotted color,
but by what name people of those parts
call them it. is better to ask Macedon
ians. At any rate these fish live upon
the native flies which fall into the river
and are like no flies of any other part;
one would neither call them wasplike
In appearance, nor would one reply to
a question that this creature is formed
like what we call the bumble bees,
nor yet like the honey bees themselves.
It has really the proper fashion of each
of the above. In audacity it is like a
fly. in size it might be called a bumble
bee, in color it rivals the wasp and it
buzzes like the honey bees. All com
mon creatures of this sort are called
horse tails. These pitch upon o the
stream to seek the food they affect, but
cannot help being seen by the fish
which s-wim Underneath.
"So whenever one of them sees the fly
floating he comes softly, swimming un
der the water, afraid of disturbing the
surface and so scaring away his game.
Then he comes near the shady side of
the fly, gapes 'and sucks him in, just
like a wolf snatching a sheep from the
fold or an eagle a goose from the
yard. This done, he disappears beneath
the ripple. "The fishermen understand
these maneuvers, but they do not make
any use of these flies for a bait for the
fish, for if the human hand lays hold
of them they lose their natural color,
their wings fray and they become un
eatable to the fish. So for this reason
they make no use of them, disliking
them because their nature forbids their
capture.
"So with angling craft they outwit
the fish, devising a sort of lure against
them. They lap a lock of reddish wool
round the hook, and to the wool two
cock's feathers which grow under the
wattles, ajid are brought to the proper
color with wax. The rod is from six
to ten feet long, and the horse hair line
has the same length. They lower the
lure, the fish Is attracted by the color,
excited, draws close, and, judging from
its beautiful appearance that it will ob
tain a marvelous banquet, forthwith
opens its mouth, but. is caught by the
hook, and bitter, indeed, is the feast it
has, inasmuch as its is captured." â

VICTORIA, B. C, July 31.-George D.
Collins is finding that the British Colum
bia; courts are very difficult, to manipu
late. He lost some important ground In
Judge Lampman's court to-day, the
Judge upholding the arguments of the
prosecuting counsel on material points.
The greater part of the time in to-day's
proceedings in the famous extradition
case â¢ was taken up in the argument ; of
objections previously raised by the ac
cused regarding ;theadmissibility of dep
ositions v and .;\u25a0 papers from San
Francisco by Detective Gibson. As to the
depositions, the position taken by Collins
was ; that they wero 'not properly authen
ticated and that, whereas it was stated
that they were originals, a certificate pre
sented with them signed by J. J. Greif
said they were copies. â¢
any decision being given as to
the depositions, the question of the ad
missibillty of the documents relatlnit to
the suit for maintenance brought by
Charlotta E. Collins against the accused
was taken up. Collins contended that
these documents were immaterial and ir
relevant. If the. alleged oath made to
the affidavit was false, it was false when
made and that - event .. was anterior to
these papers. Therefore everything sub
sequent was immaterial and irrelevant,
he contended. Attorney Hlggins for the
prosecution contended that the papers
should be admitted and 4" thls he was
upheld by Judge Lampman.
Collins then announced he would attack
the Canada evidence act on the ground
that it was unconstitutloal. The case
will be cotinued to-morrow morning.
Despite the fact that the country for
miles around has been staked out a
number of excited prospectors with
outfits left to-night for the scene of
the new find. It adjoins property
owned by Governor Sparks and asso
ciates, and is close to the famous

SAN DIEGO. JuJy SL-The Board of In-
Qii'ry, appointed by Admiral Goodrich,
to hear the evidence pertaining to the
disastrous boiler explosion on the sun
boat Bennlngxon In San Diego harbor on
July Zi. convened on. board tna flagship
Chicago at noon to-day. The sessions will
be secret. The board consists of Com
modore Holland 2s\ Stevenson, retired,
presiding offlcer; Captain 11. XL Moore of
the Chicago and Captain Thomas S.
Phelps. Lieutenant R. C. Moody of the
-^T Me ago Is iudse advocate, whose duty
â¢h Is to tee that the facts are presented
to tha court. It is probable that the work
of th* Board of Inquiry will require sev
eral days, possibly a week. The session
to-day was a brief one.
Tfeere Is considerable conjecture as to
what the Court of Inauiry will find in Its
investigations. Several officers who have
discussed the matter think that the blame
will bo fixed on no one in particular, as
the accident was one that could not be
foreseen, and certainly was not due to
the neglect of any of the officers on board
the Bunnlnston. If the blame is fixed any
place it will be higher up in the scale,
probably In the department itself. There
is a general Impression that no Board of
Inquiry would have been appointed had
It aot b&en for promptings from "Wash
ington and the Intensity of publlo feeling.
it Is believed that the board of Investi
gation, which has looked Into the disaster,
has covered the matter thoroughly,
though no Intimation as to the results
has been given. It may be anticipated,
however, that the evidence will show that
at the tide of the explosion there was
sufficient water in the boiler, that the
etcast wca chut off from the adjacent
boilers end that the first effect cf thÂ»
#traia was the collapse of the thirty-two
inch corrugated flue through which the
flame* and heated gases pass from the
fire box. As a result of this, the escape
of steam forced out the ecect of flame
which came near causing an explosion In
the shell room and hurled boiler "B"
SLgainst boiler "D," driving the latter
. through a rteel bulkhead and against the
M>r4 of the engines. If this be correct, it
either that there was a serious
weakness In the big corrugated pipe or
that the pressure In the boiler had
reached an enormous degree.
A suggestion comes from a person In a
position to have information, as to what
was disclosed by the examination In the
boiler-room. : to the *2tect that the pip*
"\u25a0'"leading- to . the eteam gauge v was ;so
clogged with scale and rust that no
proper register of pressure, could have ,
s^ been made, and also that the release ,
mechanism of the safety valve was so '
rusted that it was Immovable. No state- ,
ment can be made positively, however,
that such a condition was disclosed or
that evidence to this effect will be pre
sented to the Court of Inquiry.
Another death, that of G. H. Hallett, a
EÂ«man, which occurred to-day brings the
total number up to 65.

and ordered the case placed on the

appear to be refeentenced to be hanged.
Woods was sentenced to be. hanged on
Jartuary 31, 1903, but the appeal to the
Supreme Court stopped the execution.
Woods has frequently said that he
did not mind being hanged, but be
fore paying the penalty he would like
to be alone for a few minutes with
William Henderson, who turned State's
evidence against him and the other de
fendants. Henderson will also appear
in court this morning and the charge
of manslaughter against him will be

Land Owner Seeks to Re

" A legal battle f of possession of tho
power stored in the waters of Lake Ta
hoe' that find . their way through the
Sierra and over Nevada's desert 9 be
tween the banks of the Truckee River
opened in the Superior Court of this
city and county yesterday. Murray F.
Vandall appears as plaintiff and Ed
ward Malley as defendant.
Some time ago, says Vandall, he
purchased a portion of section 7, town
ship 15 north, range 17 east. Mount
Diablo base and meridian, from the
'Dormer Lumber and Boom Company.
The land purchased, by him, he says,
covers the source of the Truckee River
and the conveyance Included a huge
dam, built by the : lumber company
named, with which' the flow of water
from.. the lake info the river is con
trolled. The principal, object he had in
view when he made the purchase, says
Vandall, was.. to .'utilize the waters of
the t Truckee for power purposes, in
cluding the generation of electricity,
'etc. ; , ; -â¢;\u25a0
"But recently, he says, he learned that
Malley had acquired from the Dormer
Lumber and Boom Company a right of
way across the' portion of section 7
still held by it and that Malley pur
posed cutting a canal from the lake to
the Truckee, below the property owned
by the plaintiff, for the purpose of a
power plant.
Should this be done, says Vandall, It
would defeat the object of his purchase
and take from his hands the right to
regulate the flow of.- water from the
lake. This, he says, would leave him
at the mercy of the defendant. Van
dall asks that the defendant be en
joined.from, cutting the canal and that
it be decreed that ho has the sole
right to control the waters of the lake
that flow out over the lands purchased
by him or that may still remain in the
hands of the lumber and boom com
pany. : 1 .-^"'.^S r iXfe'.
The Question Involved is an Interest

in the case will probably control the
development in the future of all power

President : AT W. Foster and General
Manager Jamea Agler oÂ£ the California
Northwestern Kallway and of the North.
Shore Railroad are about to announce |a^
plan, for retrenchment in those two com
panies Â» that will include a general j con
solidation of various departments which
escaped merging *at the time^ the Foster
syndicate ;' took ov6r the< North -.Shore
road. It was stated yesterday by-Gen
eral Manager -* Agler that in ; all - proba.-,
bility -the -decision of President Foster
and "himself: relating to the consolidation
of , the departmental offices of, the two
roads will bd' made known to-morrow, j
; It is generally, understood at tfee offices
of the two;, companies "in -this city that
,the changes will mean tha retirement of
a number, of high salaried men and that
inVthe majority of cases . the men to go
\u25a0.will- mainly : - bÂ« those who are engaged in
operating and maintaining the North
Shore road. President Foster, \ after tak
ing over the North Shore road, and look
' ing 'byer its .badly /muddled finances, 'was
quick to .realize that retrenchment would
be necessary and he Immediately proceed
ed with; a ! plan in that direction by con-
Bolldatiiig the position of managers, su
perintendents, : chief engineers, auditors,
general - f reigbTt and passenger officials
and the -local ticket offices. It was his
intention to carry out his plan farther,
but" the prolpnged illness of former Gen
eral Manager Frazier and his' final re
tirement - caused a postponement^ of ac
tion. '
The latest plan Is to consolidate - tho
car and machine shops of the California
Northwestern at Tiburon with those of
thte North Shore road at Sausallto, dis
pose of one of the two steamer superin
tendents, â¢ merge the engineer offices of
B. H. Fisher and F. K. Zook and the po
sitions of master mechanics. It is. esti
mated that tfrese changes will save the
owners of the roads many thousands of
dollars a month, without interfering with
the operation of the lines. In making
changes it has invariably been the prac
tice of President Foster to fully con
sider the services of the" men In his em
ploy together with their conditions at
home and there Ib every reason for be
lieving that he will order General Man
ager Agler and other heads of depart
ments to do the same In the coming gen
eral shake-up. In view of that fact it is
expected that many of the men who have
been working for the California North
western road at Tiburon for many years
will be permitted to retain their positions,
for- not a few of them have their homes
there and have reared families at the
point." '.';">
Yesterday General Manager Agler is
sued circular letters to the owners of the
different bus lines along the route of the
California Northwestern and the North

would not be renewed. Later in the day,
however President Foster made an ex
ception in the case of the company oper
ating'buses between the California and
Northwestern line . and West End. Two

pulled all over the barroom. Vainly he
told partner No. 1 that he was bound

whereupon No. 1 immodestly confessed
that she had become so infatuated with
his companionship that she would die
rather than lose it. Then a blow was
aimed by No. 2 at the face of No. 1,
but, his intervening face received it,
and for a few moments thereafter he

While he succeeded in avoiding the
reception of serious facial injury, he was
sartorlally damaged. The new suit

the establishment was not a free read
ing-room, but a place for the buying
and selling, of literature, when "What
Shall We Eat?" suddenly vanished and
Mr. Booker started doorward. Suspi
cious that the guide to proper feeding
had- been .pilfered and .was then in. one
of Mr. Bookeris pockets, Mr. Weljen
derf. instituted a search that resulted
in full- confirmation of his suspicion^
The defendant's wife, who manages a
lodging-house on Howard street, in
formed the, Judge that her husband's
gastronomic ailment was recently con
veyed by him from Maine, .in s which
State he, was born, reared and' made
stomachically, weak, by partaking.-in
discriminately and at irregular *.inter.
vals of the popular viands of the com'
monwealth, consisting largely., of cbrn
pone that was warranted to sink in
stantly and of its own volition, hog lib
erally garnished with hominy, butter
milk of acidulous -sourness and cider of
adamantine hardness. \u25a0 . : .
Ere he came " westward Mr. Book
er consumed' oceans of liquefied spe
cifics guaranteed to rout dyspepsia,
and thÂ«"<> pills he swallowed out
numbered the bullets exchanged in
the Russo-Jap war. It was with hope
that change of climate and scenery
would remedy his internal imperfection
and its accompanying mental derange
ment that he crossed the continent, but
alas! he had dallied too long with the
Indigestible^ of Maine. Neither his
body nbr his mind has been benefited
by the change of locality/ While he
has religiously adhered to the fari
naceous diet prescribed by a great local
medicine 0 man, he has yearned for the
corn pone and other gastric-juice de
flers of Ills youth, and the yearning
has accentuated his mental unreliabil
ity. His brain certainly was awry
when he stole "What Shall We Eat?"
for the book was of such trifling cost
that he could have paid for it a hun
dredfold without- exhausting his pe
cuniary resources. .. ./.
The court apparently attached some
credence to Mrs. Booker's statement,
for Mr. Booker was remanded for one
week and allowed to go on his own
recognizances. Then, accompanied by
pitying glances, from oan0 an epicurean
,bench and a bar pt gourmets, the mis
erable Mr. Booker was escorted from
the court by his better half.

3IUNICIPAL LEAGUE
WOULD AMEND LAW
KANSAS CITY. July SLâ The Santa Fe
Railroad's answer to the proceedings be
gun in the Federal court here, charging
it with contempt of court in violating the
court's injunction against giving rebates,
was filed to-day. Tiie argument in the
case probably will not be heard until
some time in the fall.
The complaint against the Santa Fe
was that it granted rebates to the Colo
rado Fuel and Iron Company on coal
shipments after Having been enjoined
from such practices, along with a dozen
other railroads. The institution of the
suit is the result of an investigation on
the rart of ,t_he Interstate Commerce
Commission. "v" v
1.1 its Si.nswer, the Santa Fe admits that
at one time it did give rebates, but claims ;
that it has not offended in that respect
since the injunction was issued. Its'ar
rangement with the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company, it says, was a perfectly
legitimate one The Santa Fe accused a ;
rival cf the Colorado Fuel and Iron Com
pany of being the instigator of the suit
ugainst the road. Its answer says:
"Prior to the filing of the bill for. -an
injunction in the above cause, competi
tion between the different railroad com
panies for the transportation of grain
and packing-house products from the
Middle Western States and to'secure such
traffic became co marked and manifest
that this defendant was satisfied that the
published tariff rates of other competing
earners were being secretly cut on such'
ccmmou...es, and in order to protect its
own traffic and to secure a fair share of
tuch traffic for itself, as against its com
petitors, it found that it was necessary,
owing to the deception practiced by other
carriers, to also secretly cut its own pub
lished tariffs upon its own lfne, where it
found ilie same necessary to secure or
protect Che traffic of the aforesaid com
modities, and that when an investigation
was had by said Interstate Commerce
Commission, as referred to in said In
formation, in regard to the secret rate
cutting on grain and packing-house pro
ducts, Paul Morton, its second vice presi
dent and then in charge of its traffic,
freely laid before said <> commission the
methods adopted to secure traffic in said
commodities in competition with the
other carriers in order that the unlawful
methods indulged in might be fully ex
posed and a stop put, if possible, to such
practices."
The answer 6ays that Immediately
upon the issuance of the restraining
order the traffic managers of the va
rious Santa Fe lines notified the traffic
, agents of the company of the order and
Instructed them to comply with it.
The Colorado Fuel and Iron Com
pany, the Santa Fe says, is a result of
the desire of some competitors and
similar Industries along the line of the
El Paso and Southwestern Railroad to
use the kind of coal mined by the Colo
rado Company. The El Paso and South
western, a connection of the Santa Fe
Company, has lines to the Colorado
Company's mines. There are coal mines
nearer to the smelters than the Colo
rado Company's mines, but the smelters
do not like to -use their coal, says the
Santa Fe, because It Is not a good
stPara-raaktr.
In order to secure this coal traffic,
says the Santa Fe. it made an agree
ment with the El Paso andÂ°Southwest
ern to haul coal to connecting points
\u25a0with the latter road, for which service
the Sar.ta Fe was to receive as its pro
portion for the haul $2 90 a ton. The
smelters and othor industries agreed
to pay the Colorado Company $1 15 a
ton for this coal.
When the restraining order was
mede, says the Santa Fe's answer, a
tariff was published covering this
agreement. It Is alleged against tho
Santa Fe that it violated this published
tariff and on this point the answer
says:
"In preparing said Joint tariff said
traffic manager inadvertently; -but with
out any desire to evade such order. In
cluded* in said Joint rate prescribed in
said tariff the cost of coal, but this
defendant at all times received upon
the coal so carried under such joint
tariff only its proportion or agreed
division of the entire or through
charge of carriage."
The answer contends that the prac
tice of collecting from the smeLters the
price of the coal and the freight charge
was to facilitate business -and not to
afford a* vehicle for rebates.
The answer names the Caledonian
Coal Company, whose coal, the answer
says, the smelters would not use. as
the instigator or the Interstate Com
merce hearing that resulted in the suit
against the Santa Fe.
PARIS, July 31.â The activity of the
German commercial agents and officials
with reference to the^ Moroccan situa r
tion is causing \u25a0 great doubts on the
part of the French people as to Ger
many's good faith. Despite the de
cision of the two Governments c not to
interfere with the status quo until the
international conference meets the Ger
njans are trying their utmost to es
tract commercial concessions from the
Sultan, hoping thereby to strengthen
Germany's position at" the â¢ conference.
Inquiries in well informed circles,
however, show that it Is not believed
that Germany Is officially authorizing
these efforts^ . to secure advantage,
though differences are likely to arise
from this action with consequent pro
traction of negotiations. Count Yon
Tattenbach-Ashold" appears to be fur
thering the efforts of the German
agents, -syhich already have resulted In
securing a concession for the construcr
tion of wharves, while strong efforts
are being made to obtain a "cable con
cession and the acceptance of a Ger
man loan. Such proceedings, it is be- :
lieved here, do not tend to hasten a
friendly understanding,, but the ap
proaching interview between Premier
Rouvier and Prince Yon Radolin, the
German Embassador to France, is ex
pected to result In the dispelling of
doubts and the completion of a satis
factory statement.

her to the spring, toddling ahead. When

danger and grabbed the snake by. both
hands and hurled it into the brush. , Two
other rattlers then attacked the mother,
striking her dress repeatedly. Filially she
escaped, almost dead from fright and ex

"TRUCKEE. July 21.â Work on tha con
struction of the large controlling- dam.
outlet and bridge at the headwaters of
the Truckee River at Lake Tahoe began
to-day with a force of sixty men. This
work was let by the Government some
eight weeks ago, and is for the purpose of
reserving the water In thÂ» lake for the Ir
rigation project in the State of Nevada.
The dam, according to the contract, must
be completed In six months. Contractor
Mattie will have to excavate 90.000 yards
of gravel and dirt, and should he find at
the depth of fouAeen feet a poor founda
tion he will have handle even more than
the specified amount of earth. In build-
Ing the dam fully 500 cubic yards of ce
ment will bÂ« used.
There will be constructed above the
dam a concrete bridge, which will be the
passage way between the Tavern and
Tahoe City. The bridge will be a model
in every particular. It will span the canal,
which will be 2200 feet long from the dam
proper to the shore of the lake. By con
structing the dam this distance from
Lake Tahoe the Government will be able
to draw at least twelve fe_et more water
from the lake and thus obviate the ne
cessity of building a big reservoir and
raising the water twelve feet, as was
first contemplated. If thÂ« Government
had proceeded as first suggested fully
$2,000,000 worth of property would have
been damaged.
It has been repeatedly suggested in this
community that the Government pur
chase the big dam owned by F. Fleish
hacker, the millionaire owner of the
Floriston Paper Mills. The Government
offered Flelshhacker $100,000 for his dam
and water rights, but he refused to ac
cept it. When the Government completes
the dam it Is now building it will draw
the water from the Flelshhacker dam by
constructing a fence extending past the*
natural outlet of the lake. It is reported
that Flelshhacker has said the Govern
ment will have a lawsuit on its hands if
it attempts to draw the water away from
Its natural course.

SAN BERNARDINO. July SLâ Fire,
kindled to clear some lands of brush
near Verdemont, jot away from the
workers this afternoon and, carried by a
stiff southwest wind, swept over Little
Mountain and into the foothills, a course
of about five miles before the fire rangers
could bring it under anything like con
trol. Late in the evening the fire again
got away. It has already destroyed many
acres of grain and stacks of hay. It
swept up toward the carnation gardens
at the base of the mountains.
Late this evening the fire spread op
the slopes of the main range, threatening
to cut off hundreds of campers in the
several canyons. Large reinforcements
are helping. the rangers and they hope .to
have the flames checked before morning.
. RENO, July 31. â The Mormons arÂ«
planning- to establish an Immense col
ony in Nevada. For two weeks past
negotiations have been in projfress
with the land owners of White - Pine
County for the purchase of an immense
tract of land. The deal was concluded
last Saturday.. . The two main tracts
are owned by the Lewis brothers and
the Sunnyside Company. A year ago
an effort was made by the Mormons to
buy this same land. A difference of
several thousand dollars in the price
caused the deal to . fall through. Now
all the. details have been agreed upon
and the transfer will be made this
week. ;".. . .
The land -is said to be -the richest in
Eastern -Nevada for hay, grain and
fruits. Surveys have been made for a
new railroad through the .country. It
will place it within direct touch with
Salt Lake. The Mormons are now
cramped for space in Utah and for sev
eral years have looked toward Nevada
to establish another colony.

HA o LFMOON BAY, July 31.â The
proposition of the Ocean Shore Rail 4
road to run its main line through the
center of the town has not received
'the unanimous indorsement that was
! expected from the citizens of Half
! moon Bay. It is claimed by many who
I, are vitally interested in the coming of
! the road that it will be the' worst of
'public policy to sacrifice the main high-
I w-ay of the district to a railroad that
| necessarily .will usurp r all traffic and
force ' teams to seek a new avenue for
their business. A halt has been called
in the 'agitation to give the railroad
this new and valuable concession.
: As the road is planned now it "will
run parallel with the beach and 1900
feet from the Â«main street of the town.
This arrangement necessarily has its
disadvantages and the railroad peoÂ°ple ;
have agreed to run the J road into town 1
if a -right of way is guaranteed by the
residents here. Such a guarantee will
cost between $2'ooo and $3000 for the
purchase of private property. The
money would be easily and x quickly
raised, however, were it not for the
other and more Important objection.
If the new railroad were to run on
the main street of this town it would
| usurp the main highway from Puris'
sirha to the new landing, a distance of
eight miles. j
SAN RAFAEL, July 3Lâ There wUI bo
a meeting of prominent citizens of this
I county In the office of District Attorney
Boyd at 2 o'clock on Thursday afternoon,
August 3, to discuss the best ways and
means to prevent the use of dangerous
roads by automobiles and to make pro
.vislons for the enforcing of the speed
limit and other regulations now In ex
istence. Since the passage of the auto
mobile law by the last Legislature some
of the autoznobilista believe that they
have a right to use the prohibited roads
of this county and are using them, caus
ing many dangerous accidents.
There have been several cases In which
motorists have run over these dangerous
roads at late hours, frightening horses
and causing vehicles to be overturned.
There has also been complaint of the ex
cessive speed of the machines, which is
not lowered as they pass a vehicle on
a narrow road or as they approach and
pass a fractious horse. At the meeting
there will be present some of the moat
prominent San Francisco business men,
who make their homes here. â¢
Miss Leahy is, visiting her uncle, James
F. Leahy, vice president of the San
Francisco Novelty and Plating TVorks,
who has an elegant home in the Barber
Tra-ct. Â° *&.*\u25a0'/\u25a0
SAN ANSELMO, July 31.â Miss A.
Leahy and her guest. Miss A. McConnell,
were badly injured, by being thrown out
of a buggy yesterday afternoon, and are
now confined to their beds, with a train
ed nurse in attendance. Miss Leahy was
driving from her home down a steep
grade when the horse became frightened
at a number of oil tanks lying alongside
the road and bolted through the fields.
Miss " McConnell fell out first as the
buggy struck a deep gully, and Miss
Leahy followed soon after. The horse
and buggy landed in the bottom of the
creek. Both the young ladies are severe
ly bruised. Miss Leahy having a cut over
one of . her eyes and a sprained ankle
and Miss McConnell a cut on one of her
limbs.
OAKLAND, July 31.â Mayor Mott/tc
day vetoed the ordinance which proposed
to grant bicycle .riders the privilege of
using '.the sidewalks outside of . the lire
limits provided the cyclists dismounted
upon approaching a pedestrian. The
veto is based upon the enunciation by his
I Honor that the' bicycle is a vehicle ami
i that vehicles have no right on the side
walks, which, the Mayor says, should be
reserved for the. exclusive use of pedes
trians. The Mayor recommends _. : the ;
passage "of an ordinance prohibiting the j
useiof sidewalks by bicyclists.
In his message ,to the City Council the
Mayor writes:
This city has tolerated for many yeara the
use of the sidewalks by bicyclists, but always
with some provision that was calculated .to
'protect i>edestrians from injury by collision.
The experience, however, of the municipality
is that these safeguards have generally proved
ineffective and pet-sons are' continually- being
injured by' careless and reckless riders who
fall to observe the law. .
'In my \u25a0 judgment none of these regulations
can be enforced .satisfactorily, for the reason.
that, while there are many, careful and law
abiding persons who. us* this vehicle, there are
Ktill-- a great "many others who axe extremely
careless and who pay no attention to the law
unless a police officer happens to be in sight.
It seems to me that j there la but ope rem
edy and that Is to take our places .with other
cities in this respect and prohibit bicyclists
using the sidewalks -at any and all times. In. I
my opinion a bicycle is a "vehicle" and while
I know of no law or decision on., this point I
seriously doubt whether a municipality has a
right to permit a "vehicle" to use the side
walks under any conditions. I recommend to.
your honorable body the .passage of an ordi-*
nance prohibiting the ur.e of the sidewalks by
bicycles, tricycles, etc. â¢ â¢

OAKLAND, July 31. â Two more very
ugly bludgeons similar to the ones
used to beat down Thomas W. Cook
in the assnult upon him were found by
Sheriff Frank Barnet to-day not far
from the scene of the robbery in Fruit
vale, and he is of the opinion that if
they were not used by one or more of
the pals of John Schneider and George
Uiaker, who have been implicated by
.Cook's statement to the doctors, they
!iBd bc-en prepared by them for some
otht-r assault of the same character. A
strenuous tffort is now being 1 made by
the Sheriff to locate where the pipe
used was taken from and who the.
makers of these weapons are.
Frank Cook, brother of the injured
man, returned home to-day from Nova
Scotia in answer to a telegram. He
went over to the Alameda Sanitarium
at once to see his brother, but found
that the doctors still had their patient
under the influence of opiates and that
there would be little use in attempting
to talk to him.
Frank Cook says that he left his
etore in charge of his unfortunate
brother while he went on his vacation
and Euppopes that the knowledge that
the young man had been left alone
gave the thugs the idea of robbing
him. The robbers also were probably
aware that he usually took the money j
home with him Saturday nights.
The injured, man's condition is re
ported to be the same.
Crewe was persuaded to accompany the
doctor upstairs, and then Rowell began
to^ tell the police of Crewe's : actions.
Cfewe started to run. Policeman Far
rar stopped him. Crewe struck at Far- 1
ran The officer landed on Crewe's cheek,
cutting it open, and Rowell joined in tha
melee. Finally Crewe was handcuffed,
charged with battery^ and put in jail.
Later he was released on $10 bail, to
appear before Justice Edgar to-morrow
morning.
BERKELEY, July 3L-Annoyed at tho
Interference of Thomas Crewe, whose
niece, Miss Amy Crewe, he was attend
ing, Dr. H. K. Rowell had recourse to
strategy to-day to secure Crewe's ar
rest, the strategy eventually bearing
fruit in the form of a bloody free-for-all
nght in the office of Marshal Vollmer
and in the corridor leading: to- the office.
Dr. Rowell was called in by Crewe
several days ago to give professional at
tention to Miss Amy at the Crewe home.
T2S Charming way. He found the young
woman suffering from diphtheria. The
case was deemed a serious one, and the
physician used measures called for in
such cases. Cr,ewe apparently be
lieved himself the equal of the medical
man in knowledge of what should be
done for the girl, and his interference
provoked Dr. Rowell greatly.
"Keep out," eaid Rowell to Crewe, but
the command availed nothing. ~i.
"You will spread the infection," warn
ed Dr. Rowell, but the obdurate uncle
laughed and continued to interfere. Dr.
Rowell was helpless. Crewe is a big
man. Rowell is not so big. At this
point strateg> r came into play.
"Have a ride in my new carriage,"
sai^. the doctor, blandly, to Crewe at ;
noon to-day. â¢!
"Delighted," said the "unsuspecting
Crewe. Rowell then drove to the office i

I j tury wedding, with a vengeance that was
>J ; celebrated this afternoon in Oakland
â¢ i when bride, groom, witnesses and the offi
ciating knot-tier sallied forth in an au
| tomobile and celebrated the ceremony in
L the big touring car on a street corner.
Willard Rush Zibbell and Georgie'Kemp
fer were the contracting parties.
' In the large machine with the "chug
J j chug" of the wheels for accompaniment,
- j Justice of the Peace W. R. Qearypro
, j nounced the words that united Zibbell
i and his bride. ;The witnesses who sat in
the forward seat with a chauffeur were
â¢ j J. W. Zibbell and Dora Zibbell, the
' J groom's father and mother and
- 1 Miss Ena Zibbell, his sister. The {
â¢'- groom is a horseman of some j
' i note, and is a member of the firm of Zib
' i bell & Son, proprietors of the Zibbell
â¢ ! stable, 672 Eleventh avenue, San .Fran
: j Cisco. The bride is also aÂ° resident of the
1 ; city across the bay, whence came the
1 bridal party in the automobile to-day.
â¢ The wedding occurred at the corner of
1 Sixth and Castro streets at 4:30, o'clock.
Shortly before that time Justice Geary
1 1 was summoned to the County Clerk's of- !
flee by a. message which announced .that |
his services would be required at a mar- |
riage ceremony.
judge: -taken; along.
When the Justice arrived he was intro
f duced to the automobile party, and was
I invited to jump in for a ride. It was ex-
I plained to Judge Geary that the bride
I and groom did not desire" to leave the
' machine, so a quick \u25a0 run was made to
J Sixth and Castro streets as a convenient
â¢ I and quiet spot for the ceremony. Quickly
j tht, event was concluded, and Justice
j Geary left the machine, waving adieu to
tho bridal party as the automobile faded
away in the cloud of 'dust,. Headed back
for San Francisco."
Around the unique wedding is a. touch
t>f unusual sentiment and pathos. *Sev
, eral weeks ago Zibbell was touring in
{ Fresno County with a. . friend. While
! walking across the track one night they
j were struck by a train at a railroad
j crossing. The friend was killed, and Zib
bell was crippled for life. His left arm
was cut off and his right hand was sev
ered. He also suffered internal injuries
which for many days left him hoyering
between life and death. The injured man
was nursed hack to life by' careful and
attentive effort.
The most anxious of all during this time
was the young -man's sweetheart^. Mrs.
Kempfer, to wham he was engaged to be
married. Many days passed before word
was at last given that Zibbell would live,
j Then the betrothed pair met again, .r^ !
"\Vho," it was asked, "should have a
better right to care" for this unfortunate
man than the woman who was to be his
wife?" ';"
It was all talked over among the Zib
bells. The young man was sure he did
not want his sweetheart to make the'sac
rifice. She, with a loyal heart and" in
sistence that could not be-broken,'-de
clared she must ..take her place' at her
lover's, side Â° as his wife. Only In that
capacity could she be his helpmeet in his
hour of sore need and trial.
HAS HER OWN AVAY.
So the arguments ran until the plucky
woman, like most of. her sisters, . had
her own way. Then it was a problem, in
view of Zibbell's o condition, to* have the
marriage celebrated without undue no
tice. They desired to come to Oakland,
hoping that here it could be arranged
quietly. The family desired to be pres
ent. A procession of hacks was not want
ed, and Zibbell's condition was such that
he could not travel in the ordinary way
by boat and train. The automobile
solved the case.
Without any publicity the Zibbells and
the bride formed the party that headed
for Oakland this afternoon.* Without de
lay the trip was made to the Hall of
Records, where the necessary and
the equally necessary Justice of the
Peace were brought into service. In the
brief explanation that was made while
the Justice was on the way â¢ -to * the
rendezvous, he was told that owing to
the groom's crippled condition he could
riot leave the machine. .Judge Geary rap
idly made a mental review of the law of
the State of California on the subject of
"marriage." He could remember nothing
-that prevented him from officiating in an
automobile, so long as the contracting
parties were legally qualified. Without
any ado .he Joined in the spirit of the oc
casion and sent away the happy couple
with his judicial blessing.

HUMBLE BRITISH EXPERTS
CLEVELAND. July Sl.â The Grand. Clr
sult races, which were to have started
here to-day, were declared oft after tha
proclamation of Mayor Tom L. Johnson
that pool selling would not be permitted.
This announcement, coming at the last
moment, created consternation among
horsemen and the members of the Cleve
land Driving Park Association. At thÂ»
meeting of the Grand Circuit here last
year pool selling wa3 prevented by thÂ«
authorities at Glenville with a resulting
great loss to the Driving Park Associa
tion. When Glenville was annexed to
the city it was hoped pool selling would
b& permitted, although no announcement
to that effect could be obtained from
Mayor Johnson.
Early to-day Chief Koehler of the local
Police Department, acting under direc
tion of Mayor Johnson, called upon
Secretary Dietrich of the Driving Park
Association and informed him that pool
selling would not be permitted. A meet
ing of the officers of the association was
Immediately called and It \u25a0was decided to
finish the M. and M. consolation race.
which was unfinished at Detroit, and
then abandon tha meeting. This waÂ»
done and all gate admission fees werÂ»
refunded, together with the entrance fee*
of horsemen.
It was at first Intended to transfer the
races to " Buffalo, but telegraph Inquiry
revealed the fact that Buffalo would not
permit the transfer because of Inter
ference with the regular race week there.
The horsemen therefore have scattered
some of > them going to Buffalo and else
where, and some of them remaining at
Glenville to work out.
The third hjeat of the unfinished M. and
M. consolation purse (2:24 trot) unfinished
at Detroit, was won by Miss Inlaw. Time,
2:lUi. Getaway second. Emlle Letcher
third.
Inquiry among the directors, of the
Driving Park Association seems to indi
cate a general attention of abandoning
the Glenville track.
At to-day's meet all the entrances were
guarded by policemen and Inside tha
grounds Chief of Police Koehler per
sonally had charge of a detail of police,
all of whom had strict orders to prevent
pool selling and gambling. a
Messrs. Grohman and Mustro of Stock
ton do not seem to take kindly to the gen
eral idea that Rufe Turner will be 'the
favorite in the betting in his match with
Jimmy Gardner. They are the managers
of the black whirlwind, and while they
have unbounded faith in the ability of
their man to take home the long end of
the purse, they still have an idea they
should get odds for their o mpney when it
cymes down to the betting.' , ; . .-
A letter received from Grohman yes
terday by a friend in this city says that
at least 300 Stockton sports will be on
the special train that leaves . there Fri
day afternoon. He thlnk3 that they will
want odds of 10 to, 8 against the black
boy when it comes to betting. He argues
thaÂ£ Gardner will be pounds heavier
than Turner when they step into the
ring and that this fact, should make the
white boy the favorite. This all goes to
show that from a betting standpoint the
match which takes place at Colma on
Friday night will be the biggest thing of
the kind seen here in many months.
Most of the matches that have been
seen here have found one man a top
heavy favorite. The coming fight is a
match between two men so close together
that it seems hard to pick a favorite.
Both sides are asking for a shade of odds
for their* money, but the, chances are that
when the pools are sold it will >be even
money and take your pick. 0
Gardner Is training hard over at Lark
spur and* says he will be at the required
notch of weight on Friday afternoon and
in as good condition as he ever was in his
life. He has been under something of a
handicap on the weight question on ac
count of the cool weather, but says that
hard work on the road and In the gym- j
nsAium will bring him down all right.
SAN FRANCISCO CLUB \u25a0"â¢'.,
" GETS AUGUST PERMIT
Western Promoter* Are In the Â° House,
â¢ but Hare Xo Chance to Secure
Ten Vote*. *
The Board of .Supervisors yesterday
granted the San Francisco Athletic
Club" a permit to hold a professional
boxing exhibition daring August. Rep
resentatives of the. Western Athletic
Club were present, when the resolution?
was adopted without" objection, but
their efforts : previous tQ? secure suffi
cient' votes for the permit' proved un
availing.
I The fact that the San Francisco Club
secured the permit will probably drive
the proposed Britt and Nelson fight to
Colma,- where James Coffroth holds
sway in the pugilistic realm.
Supervisor Boxton, chairman of the
Police- Committee, was willing to rec
ommend that the permit be granted to
the Western .Club, but after he had
canvassed the situation- he found that
the club did not have the required ten
votes In its favor. " o Â°

\u25a0- BUFFALO," JuIv 31.â The third race
at Fort Krie^ was declared off to-day,
the others scratching away from Ora
Viva. There was nothing substituted
in its place and the programme con
sisted of six events. A handicap at
s*Â£ furlongs was the best race on the
card. The contest was always between
Ohiyesha and, Armistice, with Henry
Waring coming very -fast, and lapped
on them' at the finish.
JOE KANE BEATS DWYER
PORTLAND, July 81.â Fine weather
brought out a good crowd to a fast
track at Irvington Park this afternoon.
The two best events were the last on
the card, the mile and the. mile and an
eighth. Both were driving finishes and
aroused no end of enthusiasm.' Libble
Candid, a lightly played 8 to 1 shot,
nosed under the wire Just la front of
the second choice, J. V. Kirby. Loague
brought his mount, Kirby, from the
clouds and passed the favorite, Golden
Ivy, like a Hash and almost landed In
front. Golden Ivy was a bad third.
Harry Beck, an outsider, took= the
sixth race by a head from Iras, the fa
vorite, whose jockey waited too long,
trailing almost behind the bunch until
the stretch, where his mount was in
fifth place. Iras could not quite catch
the leader in the distance remaining to
be covered. In the second race Sev
enty," a well played long shot, was left
at. the post.. The summary:
First race, six furlongsâ Rose of Hllo, 7 to

ANSWERS TO VARIOUS QUERIES
A SPINSTERS ESTIMATE OF MAN
. . ... . .
MAYOR DUNNE, owes it to the people of Chicago and -o tfie
country to publish Mr. Dairy mplc's report on municipal
ownership. He procured the presence of the Scotchman, in
this country on a quasi-public mission, to influence public opinion
on an issue that involves a radical change in the function and the very
structure of government:? It is understood that Mayor Dunne pleads
that Dalrymple was his private guest. This may be so to the extent
that th.. Mayor entertained him. But he was not a private gilcst. ac
cepting private hospitality and -interested only in personal things that
do not concern the public. He came not to enjoy private hospitality,
put to execute a public commission. . ,
He was granted leave of absence by the municipality of Glasgow
because his mission was public. Mayor Dunne resorted to all known
means of the astute "advertiser to let the world know that Chicago
had borrowed Dalrymple. from Glasgow. Nobody cared to know who
Mayor Dunne invited to sleep and "cat in his'hbuse. He is not yet of
so much importance in the worhd thai there is general interest in. who
lake sup" and chow- with him. H.is retreat behind the privacy of .his
Dunne and Tom Johnson^ Bryan and .George Fred Williams,
Hearst and the uneasy spirits that "follow thcrn in various places an :
nounced when' Dalrymple "came, that it â¢ meant immediate .public
ownership for Chicago and 'that that'' fetid- city, was to be a light-set
upon a hill for the. whole United. States to follow: .'MaybP.Dufnie-iiim

FEAST AT OCCIDENTAL
: Denis O'Sullivan returned home yester
day after a successful English tour. Mr.
O'Sullivan had the satisfaction of proving
one of the successes of the last English
theatrical season and his new play. "Peg
gy Machree." written expressly for him
by Patrick Bidwell, score a hit. As the
title indicates, the scene of it is laid in
the Emerald Isle and the Irish atmos
phere is delightfully maintained through
out. The London critics declared it was a
fltlight to hear Mr. O'Sullivan's voice. His
capacity for drollery extracts the utmost
effect from Lever's famous "Widow Ma
lone" and other favorite Irish melodies
which are introduced in the play.
Mr. O'Sullivan begins an engagement at
the Grand, Opera-house Sunday matlneo,
August 20, in "Arrah Na Pogue." Dur
ing his season there he will produce "The
Colleen Bawn" and 'for the first time in
America "Peggy Machree."

Ezra Kendall stepped, quietly Into* tlie
place loft vacant by Sol Smith Russell
last night in "Weather Beaten Benson."
Possibly the fogs, have mixed people up
in their calendar, but it was a gdod win
terly house that met the .comedian last
night at the Columbia, Mr. .Kendall has
a clientele .peculiarly his' pwri. Â° It is a
congregation that has followed him from
the Orpheum to the Columbia, and fs jin
iik^ty to have to follow him back. From
his' days as the Joe Miller of vaudeville
it , -has followed him. as the author of
,"GWod Gravy," and "gravy" not so good.
Whithersoever he went it went, and Fast :
night saw Mr. Kendall's final evolution
into a player of the .Russell genre.
.Mr. Kendali's plays have evolved with,
him. . "Weather Beaten Benson." though
noi worthy of this latest Kendall, is still
mile's above the dramatized joke-book
that he. christened VThe Vinegar Buyer.".
The chief /character, Benson, is the in
ventor of patent bean cakes and potato
cakt-p, capable in limes^of good crops of
returning 1 -immense pronto. 'But there
comes dro-ugJit.and pen* an and the peo
ple with him are threatened with ruin.
He saves the situation by putting 4nto the
business some small private funds ,arid
the. rain co-meg In the nick pf time..,'
After. Kendall the. rain.- fe the star per
former in the cast. ,-It lis;_so- very wet.
Arid Benson pits in it; wallows in it and
com'ts out before the* curtain as wet as
Jess Dandy when =he ' falls into.' "the
â¢'Prince of Pilsen" fountain. The rain
still falls behind the cOrtalri and Kendall,
after a damp little speech of.^ thanks,
go<?s behind again "to cJowÂ» the halTwifiT
dows." The drama of the' drought is com
plicated with- the st<?ry of .a child; that
Benson has brouzht up. . 'â¢ â¢
Ih the amiably fortuitous way things
happen in the rural drama, the child's
pepa. (a â¢ la^yyer .and. "an out-and-.outpr
villain) discovers her and ti'ies to take,
her. away from /Benson. â¢ But mpmmer
turns up^-selling ind-eljble pensâ and
the child is sa\red.Â° ;.4L hilariously' im
possiblft widow, all French frocks, pink
tea manner.?, and a fat check book, is
in love with Benson â And he with her.
What might .Jiave- added much to the
already strong- [produced .by
Mr. Kendall's acting'is here. lost. Mrs.
Ormsby is impossible, /arid an excuse
merely for some Paris *gf owns.
, As Benson ;^lr. Kendall Â»sÂ°capita.l. It
is a portrait, not merely Â°a monologue
in three acts;'? All of 'the drollery of hfs
Joe Miller period j is ; there, but o Jlned,
finished, .'rounded out.* -And the actor
has. achieved*: a, natutalram An Its .way
as keen as Nat Goodwin's. Every jest
given to the-Â°roTe is part of it, not
patched on, and delivered with the,ut
most of sly. piquancy. The character
is capitally drawn, one finds â just that
of. a Quiot, swe^t, shrewd but peren- c
nially unsuccessful old bachelor," and
throughout lovable as Mr. Keridall
paints him. 0
The actor is particularly admirable, in
suggesting the touches of pathos, erring
perhaps a little on the side of reserve.
But the performance marks a distinct ad
vance on anything that Kendall has.be
fore done, and was greeted with every
token of enjoyment last night. Â°
Of the clever company In support; Miss
Rita O'Neal as Mrs. Piffles stands out
prominently. Miss O'Neal has a laugh
that is half the fortune of the part, and
carries her audience all the way with her
as the comely and attractive widow.
Kathryne Browne wat? the 'rich widow
admirer of. Benson's, and just as pretty,
well gowned and absurdly artificial as
the character. Little Edith "faliaferro, of,
the clever Taliaferro children, who act
becau?<Â» they can't help It, -Is a delight
fully natural child as little Miss Moses..
There is again- another young girl, Eliza
beth King, who looks and acts all of the
pretty, Blovenly'Lindy. _ â¢ \u25a0
One of the events of the evening 1 was
the appearance of Ethel Brandon, once
one of the foremost favorites of the
local stock stage. That Miss Brandon
Ftlll retains many of ' her former ad
mirers was evident from her warm wel
come last night. Her* part,- a minor
one. "was played forlall !t. w r as worth.
Mary Stockwell. who --used to .be
"Polly," and who \u25a0is -Miss Brandon's
daughter, was also in the cast, and
filled in successfully. Â° â Â° "Â°
Much would be ?ost to "Weather
Beaten Benson" in Philip Bishop, .who
is most comically bucolic as Smiley
Wiggins. .Both he and Jonn s D. Garrick
as Rusty Baftlett -would honor Peta
luma* In fact, illusion runs through the
whole cast, down to the villain, clever
ly done *y Harold Itussfcll. Except for
the widow. And what of these and o the
rainstorm, the real water in the real
water-barrel, and Mr;. Kendall, one' can
set real lun a-plenty> out of '"Weather

;At one of the suburban' stations on the
Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Rail
road, several mornings' ago, there was a'
great deal of noise, . and all because the
operator was" of an cÂ°lnventivec Â° Inventive turn of
mind. From 12 o'clock, to 3 -in the morn
ing there are no 'trains to disturb the
knight of the key ctfnd a. great rivalry
exists along the Una in the rate to dis
cover a way to sleep ' those three long
hours and wake up in time to give the
morning fllÂ«r the "block."
The rules oÂ£ the road require" that the
engineer must see the signal change from
red to white before hecan go ahead. For
an u operator to stop the flier means an en
forced vacation of ten daj-B. The operator
in question had a mind of his ownl
Alarm clocks were tabooed, and there is
no telephone in the station. Accordingly
be strung a rope between two -telegraph
poles several hundred yards ' down the
traclc and extended- lt o on "spools to the
6tation. .^â¢V. I c ;..;V- '.
On the end of the rope was t a coal
bucket full of rocks. c When the train
(jcame along it cut the rope and dropped
$he coal bucket of rocks on the floor
with a clatter that' would' wake the dead.
All went well until the 'morning in ques
tion; rope iwas scarce and a quality of
considerable strength was used. The
operator was, "in the hay" as usual when
the train came along. Suddenly he* was
awakened .with a clatter louder thaq
usual. He pulled the Â°block and; the train
went pounding by. But the coal bucket
was gone. The rope was too strong, and
refused to break? it became entaneled
In the engine* and through the window
glass and all "went the coal bucket.
Rip! bang! clippity-clatter went the
bucket through a window of a near-by
residence and back again to the side of
the engine. Half the residents' of the
vicinity were awake before the train
passed. About eight miles down the track
the engineer, thinking something was the
matter with his machinery, stopped the
train. HHo^ o discovered " that some one Jiad
"tied a can to his engine." \u25a0'â¢
Detective Hart has the case In hand
and he is doing lots of gum shoe work

It aid reduce tolls two years ago from

are thopÂ© who reckon that If tolls were
now reduced to 8 francs Jthe company
would -still be able to declare a -yearly
dividend of 25Â° per cent, and that a few
years hence a jstlll further reduction can
be mede without Impairment' "of the legal

A curious error was made in a dispatch
the other day, which said this year's div
idend was only 14.1 per cent. Not for, a
long time has it been so low. Jhe dis
patch should have said ifcÂ° o was 'l4lÂ° francs,
a share, a far different thing. As the
shares are of 500 francs pach, the div-.
idendjs at Jthe v rate of 25.2 per cent,- or
just twice whaCwas at first stated. 0 I^ast 3
year's dividend was =130 francs a share,
or 26 per cent., Now the 'London agree
ment binds the company not to appro
priate profits â of more than 25 Der .cent, '
but to reduce "the tolls as much and as^
often as may be necessary to "keep them
down to Â° that figure.' That is why the
company proposes another^ reduction.

difference between then- and; now! At
that c time men. ,were \u25a0saying the- Suez

expenses. At the present time its profits
are so' enormous" that the company is
compelled again and again to reduce the
tolls in order, to keep the dividends with
in legal bounds. ,Of a truth, Mr. Green
wood was prescient when, cthirty-five
years ago, he persuaded the British Gov
ernment to buy the -Khedive's; shares.
Lord Derby, the Foreign Minister, did
not ,like the scheme. Slr o Stafford North
cote, Chancellor of the Exchequer, dis
tinctly disapproved it. Disraeli himself.
Prime Minister, was doubtful. .
It did not aeem a temptipg thing to
pay $20,000,000 for shares, the Interest on
which had been mortgaged for' nineteen
years.' But Mr. Greenwood was persist
ent. He pointed | ouU that most of the
shares", acart from the Khedive's, were
held in France, while S6 per cent of the
traffic through the canal was British.
So British commerce must pay tolls into'
French pockets. The tolls were high and
when England asked ' that they be"- re
\u25a0dueed France answered that if England
did not like the canal she" might send her
commerce by ihe old route around the
cape. In the end Mr. Greenwood's pleas
prevailed and the British Government
paid $20,000,000 for shares that are now
worth $140,000,000. /Â« .v...-:.

' WASHINGTON"; â¢J3. C.',> July 81.â The
State Department ;hadÂ°not, up to the time
of closiris .this afternoon received official
notificationof the effort of San Francisco
merchants to haye 3 that department in
vestigate the boycott of American gqqds;
by Chinese. Unofficially it was 'said to
night that it' was probable that, the
American /consuia= in -China would, be
aeked to make a j-eport on the subject.
The dispatch,, this morning .that ' Getz
Bros. & Co. had' received cable advice
to ' cancel: all * orders for shipment from
China created some surprise. \u25a0 The Bu
reau^ of Commerce and 'Labor and State
Department have {Jiot inclined to serious
consideration ,of the: boycott for the rea
son that China's trade with this country
is comparatively small and is nil bo far
as tho .East is concerned. However^ the
Importance of the business of the Orient
to the Pacific Coast is realized. and every
effort will be put forward to bring about
an amicable adjustment of trade rela
tions, if such is possible.
There =Â°is a feeling of resentment at
China's actions. This feeling will un
doubtedly be predominant ., in the next
Congress. The East regards China's at
tack as tantamount to a challenge and
it does not like the Celestial attitude.,
To-day there was gossip in the State De
partment, touching on this country's deal
ings withithe Chinese in â the Philippines
and elsewhere. =Â°The impression prevails
that if the United States will keep a stiff
upper, lip. meet boycott with tariff legis
lation and stringent laws, regarding the
introduction of Chinese goods into i the
Philippine, Hawaiian and Pacific Coast
markets, there .will soon be> a let vp o in
the fanatical- movement now under way.
The State Department Is aware that the
Chinese, Government does not sanction
the boycott, Of this, it has been assured.
The .iepartment will request Information
on the subject from its v repreesntatlves
just as soon as San Francisco's request is
received. â¢ o Â° \u25a0 o c '
Foreign \ competitors are said. to be re
sponsible 'for the agitation. Every as
surance has been given by this country
to China' that the exclusion law will not
be enforced' against merchants, students
and the better class of' Chinese. * The
Government feels that It has done every
thing' In ttn.power to pacify the Chinese
and if this â fails it 13 believed that swift
retribution for 'the boycott will follow
when Congress convenes. \u25a0

The long-abused privilege enjoyed by

Byrne, general passenger agent 'of the
Santa Fe Company's Western lines, who
arrived here yesterday from Los Ange-;

Charles Fee of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, who is Just back from Chicago, will,
meet to-day d or the purpose of discussing'
the. advisability "of changing the rules re
garding* the reservation of train berths.
It has become apparent 'to the rallr@ad:
officials that the broad sc6pe given to
traveler's, especially business men, in the
mattor Â°of engaging berths, . is Â° operating
not only against the, welfare of 'the gen
eral'public but proving an expensive ex-r
perience to the railroad . companies^ par^
ticularly In times, . such as these when,
affairs like the Portland exposition en
courage heavy passenger traffic. Â°
Â» It la a common custom for i people to;
go to the railroad offices and reserve a
berth, a section or ,a drawing-room a
week or so before they intend leaving the
city, and then give it up at the last mo
ment, whereas, . had it been free, some
I other and more anxious traveler, might 0
have got It. ; ' ; ' 5Â°
There ia also a custom among the local
representatives of the foreign lines tbÂ°
engage' numbers of berths weeks In adr
vance on some of the first-class trains"
with the hope of using; them later, when
regular' patrons purchase transportation."
It is frequently the case ,that some one
rushes lnto^he railroad offices and ' is
eager" to get a' berth ori" an outbound"
train." but cannot be accommodated.
Later the train leaves and' it o is discover
ed that several of the berths are 'unoc
cupied' 'Investigation generally "reveals
the fact that, these berths have, been
taken up in advance by some one who
has decided at the last moment to post-/

t pulpit in" relation to the industrial prob

c Spe.akirig.of organized laborers he held
I that they know more of actual conditions
j than they were given credit for, and
Â£>Â£id a high compliment, to labor leaders
â¢l.of San Francisco, some, of whom he con-
I sidered fitted to hold high positions.
i While exonerating employers generally
j from knowlnglj" being parties to corrupt
dealings s in; connection with the calling
and stopping, of strikes In Chicago he,
hevcrth,less, exposed' the ! agents bqth of
' employer and employe who had- eierted
every nefarious ihflunce in such matters.
FINDS CORIUTPTIONV
Taylor said "he had been ap
pointed with others -.by the. Mayor of
"Chicago to inquire into the present strug
1 gle and had found, a man employed for
jflve years who had haindled JiX),O()O to call
on and call off strikes in conjunction
with labor leaders. . They would "never
' have peace In Chicago, he declared," until
I they broke up the r'gangs of thugs' on
j both eldes." There -existed a conspiracy
j of wreckers on both, sides getting what
I they could oat of the wreck. >
; He called on men to put into practice
\u25a0 the ? golden ruie and also to love their
neighbors a^ themselves". With such, a
condition "existing, he said, we should
sooh-not krtow Chicago.-;
i-flere he denounced .the gambling in
"breadstuff" In thejpit. As for pplitics.
Professor Taylor held amid cheers that
"it" came next to religionâ the most, sacred
thing in the World.
In following the gplden rule he admit
ted tliat it would cost muchâ but Christi
anity spelt cost. He spoke of the bear
ing of the cross, holding that it waJ not
the cross that ' loomed \u25a0 from the church
spires nor the cross'thai dangled from
the woman's neck that was all. f, .
', Discussing settlement work he told'ot
the, "little" Oxford University" which had
settled in . the East End of. London
whose Influence there made life worth
the living for it relieved the dull mondt l
. ony of the industrial system. \ c j
He explained the efforts of Cadbury In.
Brrroingham, whose factory is made a
plaice r ofÂ° spiritual i= as well as material
comfort, Cadbury himself conducting the
morning praj'ers, being in complete touch
\u25a0j with a!i^in,Ms emplpy. Â° s

.The .work'" 1 of the wealthy shipowner,
Charles "Booth, whoÂ°'has o labored for
I years to Â° trace and remedy as far as is
in his power the conditions of the masses,
was explained.' â Â° " ..;
. This man, said Taylor, had been shock
ed when reading "Outcast London," and
set himself the' taskÂ°of investigation and
piling, up statistics. He found in many
instances thato poverty was the cause of
drink as weir as drink being the o cause
of poverty^ arid af ter^ analyzing all con
ditions he" published the results.
Though one of tliecbusiest men In Lon
don, Booth wrote and cpubllshed numer
ous volumes, and in this direction had- ex
pended upward" of $250,000. Taylor was
surprised to- find that ;his works had not
been read by any one with whom he had

PITTSBURG. July 3f.-^-That o the new
combination of oil .concerns and large
individual interests in. ..Kansas and In
dian Territory fields "is being formed
for Standard Oil Interests was rumored
to-day from" the West. The negotia
tions for this purpose" are in "the hands
of the Mellon, interests of 3 this city,
who financed the J. M- Guffey Pe
troleum Company anfl control that con
cern. The rumoV was broached to A.
W. Mellon, president of the Mellon Na
tional Bank. , bu\ he and R. B. Mellon,
after considering the" matter, refused
to make a statement. \u25a0
1 -Those welt aecuainted withÂ°the his
tory of the J, M- Guffey Petroleum
Company are unanimous lnÂ°the be- "
lief that the Standard interests are at
present interested.Â°in the developments,
but they are not "so certain that the
Standard will nol take over
the new combination. 3 The Mellons and
their powerful allies 'have shown much
financial shrewdness. Several deals of
Importance have been carried through
by. them. One of their characteristic
plans is to take a nnowe o w enterprise" and
with their large 3 capital .bring it to a
point where" leading interests find that
it Is. very 'desirable o to acquire their
holdings. This policy, is the one that
many, believe will be followed ulti
mately w,ith this new western combina
tion. There are t ewÂ° who doubt the
ability of the Mellon Interests with
their allies to make the new .combina
tion an effective competitor of thÂ»
Standard. That the Pittsburg bankers
would diaoose of their valuable prop
erties at 0 a satisfactory remuneration
does not seem to be doubted.' One of
the wealthiest of those in close touch
with Mellon is H. C.Â» Frick. Another
prominent man who" Is Hated as one of
the directors of the Mellon National
Bank Iq, Senator Philander C. Knox.

"I was a great sufferer from rheumatism.
My arms were so stiff and sore I could hardly
use tÃem. Finally I became so bad that I
thought I should become paralyzed. My hands
Sand arms would feel numb and I would have a
tingling sensation In them, and I was told that
paralysis began that way. I tried many medi-
cines, but nothing helped me until I took the
Electro-Chemio treatment, and that helped ma
right away.

have been thoroughly, cured by the EZectro-

RUEF GANG IS CAUCHT
AT STUFFING REGISTER
fraudulent Enrollment From Gity and County
' ';.' Hospital Is Investigated by Grand Jury. :
â¢ Forces organised under the auspices of the Satt Francisco.
Republican League are working methodically -to 'bring to thepri-"
mary poll's next Tuesday a 'large percentage, of the registered ..
voters of the city. In several districts, zvhtre the 'citizens are* tn
clined tobc a little apathetic, the house-to-house plan of canvass
ing is in vogue. 9 All the indications" point to an unusually large
primary vote, and. the' growing interest in the important event may \
culminate in a popular uprising to redeem the city from the reign
of graft and the sway of grafters' The Grand Jury lias evidence
that the Ruef politicians have been stuffing . the register. Indict- -'
ments will probably be returned. . v * \u25a0'. "
Conclusive evidence of the fraudulent
[methods of registering voters by the
I Ruef-Schmitz administration was brought
to light at the City and County Hospital
[yesterday. An Investfgation by the ffare
| man of the Grand Jury showed that there
j was a larger number of voters', on the
lists as coming from the institution than
were employed there. 0
This means -that besides the men on
the payroll, who are bona fide' residents,
a number of the patients have been en
tered as eligible to participate â¢ in -the
election, which" Is a .direct violation of
j the law. - Besides those . fraudulently
registered, . another violation of the law
was dlcoveVed in that two- deputies from
the Registrar's office were sent to the
hospital to enter* the names of the em
! ployesâ andÂ° as It has developedâ others
not legally entitled; The city's laws say
\u25a0 that every must appear in person
at the. City* Hall and enter his name 1 on"
the book as an eligible. The; registration
af o the hospital is therefore Illegal,
v A- \u25a0 report, ; was sent \u25a0to Foreman An
drews f roni\ the Republican League that
there were .a larger number _of voters on,
the list than '.were temporarily residents
of the preefnet? Andrews â¢started on the
tour of Investigation" yesterday morning.-
With him'were'Miss Qollins, stenograph-,
er, of the Grand Jury,,. Clerk Harris from
Byington's ' office and two o bailiffs |>f Â° the

v VIOLATION' OF LAW.
After an .examination of C.Â° ,\p! H.
Clasby, recervlng clerk;' T. Rlordan, chief.
orderly; F; SL 3 Ward,Â° commissary,, and JÂ»-
P. Rftesman,' it was found' that the ad
mlnistratio'n had â¢accomplished two -vloÂ°
latibns of: the law. â¢ Although there. are
only 135 employes on the payroll at the
City and- County Hospital, of whom 36
ere ;womenâ leaving 99 actual â¢ votersâ it
was .found "that" 149 male voters had. reg
istered from that institution. This means
that'in the Thirty-second Assembly Dls
Â°trict : a municipal institution, where all
outward semblance of wrong should 3 be
suppressed, Is the first place where the
illegal methods spring forth.- , %CÂ°
No other explanation can" be offered by
.Foreman Andrews of -this unusual num
ber of registered men than that part of
them were inmates of Jthe hospital. He
says there Is no doubt of this fact.' To
be a voter in a-- precinct one must be a
temporary resident of t"~at precinct, and
hospital Inmates have. never been consid
ered such. ;v ; ; : ;";VV - , /

been plundered several times before and: o

Owing to Friendliness of

There was a rumor around the City
Hallyesterday that Martin W. Fleming
is very likely- to beappointed secretary
of the Civ jl Service Commission to suc
ceed Edward Moran. who has been'
'^finally settled upon for the Â« vacancy
created on tbe board by Commissioner
Rogers' resignation:
Fleming: was recently buStad from
his position of Warden of the City and
County 'Hospital byÂ° the Health Board,
which thus made permanent the sus

president 61 the board. -> .">
Fleming is very close to Mayor
Schmitz and Abe' Ruef, who were much,
surprised when the i Health Board
adopted :thoresojutionÂ° declaring o Flem-"
ing's position vacant. Fleming saw
the Mayor the day after his suspension
and the Mayor stated afterward that
Fleming would be reinstated in a. day
or two. ' Fleming was \u25a0 not reinstated
and now 16 out of a position. ;
The fact that Moran will be promoted
to a cominisslonershlp, as the Mayor
has already Intimated, gives him. an op-
portunity to take in out of the"
cold. The- salary, o of secretary of the'
Civil Service Conimission is $300 per
month; Hhe same as that of Hospital
Warden. ;-;*Â»/."
.The fact that Fleming stands .well
with Ruef and Schmitz lends color to
the rumor that Fleming will "be taken
care of. The Mayor himself says that
nothing will be done in the matter un
til after the primary election.
