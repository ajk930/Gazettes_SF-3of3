line D. Alexander, sister of Colonel Ed

ment to Miss Helen* Barney was re
cently announced. They, were not to be

structed-to spare no expense in tracing
the missing genis and within an hour
he had sent descriptions "of them all
over the country.
..The value of the jewels is "not given.
Their â¢ principal \ value lies - in the fact
that. they are heirlooms. It is said that
their Intrinsic value is about $20,000.
BERLIN, Nov. 16. â The rumors of
a recurrence of Emperor William's
throat malady and the necessity for
another operation are received with
the greatest incredulity in the court,

fljiily course of life is such as to almost
in itself give the lie to the report. To
day, a wot and raw day, the Emperor
took a long ride in an automobile, and
lo Ft .Saturday, in similar weather, he
delivered a speech to soldiers who

"My sister then told me of how badly
Adolph had acted the preceding day.
She said: .'Julius and Invent down

his work and finally took up a shovel
and dug a little just for f-rn. I mad*
"Although he was a man of most aw
ful temper he was a good, kind, indul
gent father and provided well for his
family. Adolph, however, kept the
family in almost constant turmoil. He
annoyed his father and - sometimes
would not speak to his mother. He
was hateful and stubborn, but I never
saw him strike any one except his poor
little crippled brother. On last Thurs
day he was unusually ugly. I went
over to see my sister and took little
Earl home to his mother. I had been
taking care of Earl during the morn
ing, as Mrs. Weber was washing/
When I walked over to the house my
sister and I exchanged loving greet
ings. I told her Earl had been crying
for his mother, so I had brought him
home. I sat and talked with her for a
while. Presently Adolph cam^
into the yard. His mother said,
â¢Dolphy,' that being the name
the family called him, 'Will you go
down to the market and bring home
some meat for dinner? Your father
has been working very hard this
morning digging postholes and you
know, Dolpry, that I always like to
give him a good dinner when he is
doing anything especially tiring.'
Adolph passed her by without saying
a word. She asked him three times
and finally he snapped out a cross and
ugly 'No.' He then went upsairs
into the house and his mother, burst
ing into tears, said: 'Dolphy is so
mean and so hateful 'to- me- it nearly
breaks my heart.' She then followed
him into the house. and I heard her
say, 'Adolph, you are doing wrong.
If you get your father . down on you
it will go hard on you.' She then
came back to me and remarked:
â¢Adolph is so mrtin he will kill us all
yet. He Irritates his father , by his
ugly ways and then his father gets
mad at me and for a time is so ugly
that I can hardly stand it' '
SHOOK FIST AT HIS MOTHER.
"My sister and I had always been the
most loving of sisters/" said Mrs.
Snowden, in answer to a question pro
pounded by the Coroner, to show the
feeling that existed between the wit
ness and the murdered woman. "We
were neighbors," she continued, "and
met almost every day. I also loved my
niece, Bertha, and my little nephew.
Earl: I was on the most kind and
friendly terms with my brother-in-law.
My sis*'- and I confided all our
thoughts to each other. My sister was
a happy woman with her husband.
KEPT FAMILY IN Â¦ TURMOIL.
She fully realized the terrible posi
tion in -which .she, was placed, but not
for ah instant did she hesitate to voice
the Â¦ words that draw the net closer
around the Buspected nephew.
During her narrative Mrs. Snow
den's eyes were filled with tears and
when reference was made to the awful
scenes of last Thursday night, a shud
der of horror ran through her frame.
A deep silence reigned in the court
room until she told of the threat made
against her life by the prisoner and
then It was that the spectators gave
vent to their feelings in a murmur of
awe a--' indignation.
It was several minutes before the
sorrow-stricken witness partly re
gained her composure and was able to
resume her narrative. %
"I shall always think Adolph guilty
until he proves his Innocence to my
satisfaction," she added in a low and
quivering voice.
Young Weber was not present to
hear the testimony given by his aunt.
He probably knew of the incr^ninat
ing words that would fall . from her
lips and preferred the quiet of his
cell.
Mrs. Snowden. who is a refined and
quiet little woman, gave her testimony
In a straightforward manner.
This startling testimony was given
by Mrs. Snowden to-night at the offi
cial inquiry being conducted - by
Coroner Shepard into the murder of
the Weber family. Trembling from
head to foot and with tears
coursing down her cheeks, the wit
ness, who is a sister of the murdered
woman, slowly uttered the words
that sent a thrill of horror through
her auditors.
Other witnesses called were A. . B.
Fleming, who testified that \ Adolph
was in .front of the burning house
when the bodies were carried out.
Adrian - Wills : testified to the fact that
he took pity on Adolph onth'e night of
the fire and .took him to his home, al
though:, they . were not friends. He
stated there were some stains on the
underwear of that looked Hike
bloodi but he was not positive/ Wills
said that ' Adolph . occupied an apart

"It was on that awful Thursday,
about 5 o'clock, that Mr. Weber came
over to my place for a pail of water.
He was In a pleasant state of mind
and talked and joked with all of us.
He not only drew a pail of water for
himself, but he drew several for us.
Me bade us a cheerful 'good night' as
he went out through the gate."
Mrs. Snowden next related how* she
saw the blazing home of her sister
when she happened to go to a window
in her home. She testified that she
rushed across to the burning house.
The lire at- that time was In the
kitchen. She said she was frantic with
excitement and men who were there
grabbed her and prevented her from
running against the window to try and
save the family. She saw her niece
taken out of the burning building and
after that she was taken away from
the sickening sight.
Continuing, she said:
- "Friday morning after the fire
Adolph came to my house.* He
brought a newspaper containing an
article reflecting on him and showed
it to my sisters. Then, rushing at me,
he accused me of being the author of
it. I denied the charge, but I said
to him: 'Adolph, you know who did
the deed. . You dare not deny it to
me.' He flew in a towering passion
and shook his fist in my face, shout
ing, 'Have me arrested, for you will
be the next one.' He cameun later
the same day with Sheriff Keena." I
told Adolph that I would believe him
guilty until he was proven innocent
to my satisfaction, andtl want to state
to this court and right before the gen
tlemen of this jury that such is my
firm and positive belief."

We were as happy as could be. Before
we went down to the garden Julius
said to Dolphy: 'You can pile up the
kindling wood while your mother and
I are. in the garden.' When we came
home Dolphy was sitting on the door
steps. His father said: *D61phy~ why
didn't you pile up the wood?' Dolphy
stood there perfectly silent, and his
father asked him the same question
three times, but Dolphy went into the
house without a reply. I followed him
in and told him he must behave him
self, but his reply was to shake his fist
in my face.'
Mrs. Snowden continuing said:
"Adolph was hateful to his" people. , He
thought they were in. his way. Bertha
was afraid of him.- for she said t6 me
one day 'I think Adolph is mean
enough to kill any one.' * The last time
I saw \ Bertha was Friday ! afternoon,
when ; she [called "to' see 'me oh her. way

full of fun. tWe joked : and laughed I&h

but added that it would -Dlease her

stay at home occasionally in the even
ing and take care of Earl we could go
out. He will never do it, and if we
ask him he is so cross and ugly that. we
now never make any requests' of that
sort of him.' She then said good-by in
â¢a cheerful manner and went home.

Nan Patterson's Case
Opens in New
York.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
James H. Cary, an attorney at law,
graduate of the Hastings Law College,
a^id well known about town.* was taken
Into custody yesterday by United
States Secret Service Agents George
W. Hazen and Thomas B. Foster and
placed in the City Prison on a charge
of feloniously abstracting gold from
iouble eagles.
Hazen acd Foster had been on his
trail for more than two years. While
they felt certain tliat Cary was respon
sible for the crime, he was so wary
that they were obliged to wait until
now before they apted.
The case is so complete, the evidence
so overwhelming that Cary acknowl
edged his guilt and shewed how he had
drilled holes Into the rims of the twen
ty dollar pieces and taken from $2 90 to
{3 worth of gold from t each. Twelve
holes were drilled in each coin from
the edge to the center, all converging.
The gold dost taken out was placed in
a spoon-shaped depression on a
block of charcoal and then fused
into a button by means of a flame
from a blowpipe. Cary, in order
to disguise the character of the : gold
that he was selling, alloyed each but
ton v ith about cents' worth of silver.
The hoJes he filled with pieces of brass
â¢wire cut to the requisite length and
filed smoothly at the top. Then the
top of the wire and the edge of the coin
vrere filed and gilded to disguise the
hole.
The prisoner said that during the
last three years he had drilled, on an
average, one twenty dollar piece per
day, or a total of at least 1000 of the
coins. Starting with one drilled dou-
ble eagle he used to change it at a
store, usually receiving three five dol
lar pieces and the remainder in silver.
Then he changed the five dollar pieces,
each one at a different place, for silver,
and changed the twenty dollars in sil
ver for a gold piece, which he after
ward drilled.
As he came out of his-Toom at 1S3S
Filbert street he was placed under ar
rest by Hazen and Foster. They found
in his pocket a drilled double eagle
which he was on his way downtown .to
have changed, and a gold button val
ued at about I*, the result of the drill-
Rig of two coins. Taking him back to
his room they found a drill, several
files, a vise, a block of charcoal and a
pint bottle filled with cut pieces of
brass wire. Â¦>
"I'm guilty. You've got me." he said.
"There's no usa denying it. I hope this
Â¦will straighten me out. Jt's coming to
me all right. How is Cress linger coni
ing out in his trouble?"
The first person to detect a drilled
coin was Thomas Burns, cashier of the
United States Subtreasury. That was
three years ago. He reported to the se
cret sen-Ice men. They found where
the buttons had been sold and got a
description of the seller. On May 2Â«?.
1902. Agrent Foster saw Cary change
?20 in silver for a $20 gold- piece in the
Swiss- American Bank. All bank tell
ers were notified, but the work of Cary
was so clever that the fraud could not
be discovered without actually weigh
ing the coins, except when they had
been much used the gilding wore off
and showed the tops of the" brass wire.

HULL. Enpland, Nov. 16. â All of
the witnesses examined to-day in the
North Sea inquiry reiterated emphat
ic denials that any strange vessels
were among the trawler fleet or any
thing that could be mistaken for tor
pedo-boats. The skipper of the Mino
said the Russians were so. close that
the fishermen could hear the bugle
calls which preceded the firing. The
third Russian vessel was only fifty
yards off when she fired. -V
On cross examination the skipper
informed Dr. Woodhouse that he con
sldeAid the Russians to be "demons
possessed" when he realized that they
were firing live shots. The skipper
of the Gull, the last witness, replying"
to Dr. Woodhouse, said that when the
trawler Crane's lights were extin
guished after the firing ceased he mis
took the Crane for a torpedo-boat.

One of the worst and greatest draw
backs to railway travel In Italy is
the want of accommodation. on many
of the trains, and strangely enough
this applies to a greater extent on long
distance trains than those made up for
short Journeys. We have no hesitation'
in saying that for any party of four or
five persons wishing to travel let us
say from Rome to Naples (six hours)
and desiring to sit together it is neces
sary to arrive at the station at least
three-quarters of an hour before the
time at which the train is advertised
to start. Even then we say without
exaggeration that the . thing is no
certainty. The use of a smoking car
riage with any degree of comfort Is al
most an impossibility.
One may arrive alone, in . reasonable
time for the train, only to find that the
very few first-class smoking compart
ments have long ago been filled with
ladies and children or more^probably In
valids. We speak as a first-class pas
senger only, and, so far as we have ob
served, the second-class accommoda
tion on Italian trains can still be
recommended. The overcrowding and
discomfort here are stretched to their
utmost limits, while the third-class
carriage may be dismissed In a few
words. This conveyance in the form of
a cattle truck is. open to' all the winds
that blow, and appears to be used
chiefly for the transport of troops.

CHEFU. Nov. 16.â The Port Arthur
Nova Krai of November 11 prints brief
details of a daring exploit which re
yulted in the finking of a four-funneled
Japanese torpedo-boat destroyer.
Japanese torpedo-boats and one de-
Btroyer were engaged in removing
mines, mostly their own, from Tache
Bay on November 3. Midshipman Dl
mitrieff conceived the Idea that he
could torpedo the Japanese boats under
covrr of darkness, as the latter were
very busy and enjoying a fancied se
curity. It was the very audacity of the
plan, the Nova Krai says, that made it
successful.
Securing a steam launch from the
battleship Retvlran, one carrying a
torpedo tube, and accompanied by a
half-dozen silent volunteers,- Midship
man Dimitrieff, in the dense dark
ness, slipped out of the harbor and
succeeded in evading the Japanese
searchlight*. .Circling around the Jap
anese boats, with the launch moving at
top speed, the midshipman came within
striking distance from the seaward
side and lauchod his projectile.
It sped Xrue to the destroyer. There

Tabor replied that never before had
he heard of a public prosecutor . at
tempting to Intimidate a committing
magistrate, nor had he ever before
heard an attorney trying to instruct a
Judge as to how a case should' be
heard. He contended that many of the
questions asked by Robinson were not
permissible and that the testimony he
was seeking to introduce would never
be allowed to go before a Jury.
Justice Smith managed to smooth
over matters until the noon recess, but
the attorneys were still In Irate mood.
Just prior to the closing of the day's
session. Attorney Tabor again entered
protest against the line of procedure of
the District Attorney. He said that
irrelevant questions were being s pro
pounded to the witnesses and he asked
the court to instruct the District Attor

ACTS AS PEACEMAKER.
Weber appeared cool and defiant
this morning when he was taken before
Justice E. O. smith for preliminary ex
amination en the specific charge of
having murdered his mother, Mrs.
Mary Weber. Only once during the
proceedings did he evince the least in
terest in the proceedings and that was
when George Ruth testified that he
(Ruth) had carried the body of little
Earl Weber out of the burning home
on the night of the terrible tragedy.
Springing to his feet and quivering
from head to foot, Weber, in a clear,
cold, ringing voice, exclaimed: "George
Ruth, you did not do it." Weber's at
torneys caught him by either arm and,
forcing him back Into his seat, ordered
him to remain quiet. The testimony
was contradictory of that given by
Weber at the Coroner's Inquest Tues
day. Weber testified on that occasion
he had carried his little brother from
the burning dwelling Into the yard.
WEBER BECOMES EXCITED.
oner he produced the following letter
written to him by Adolph:
"If a person had murdered his
father would he leave his brother
alive? Earl was not shot to tell on
him. If a person murdered his fam
ily, leaving his brother urishot, would
he rescue that brother from death to
tell on him ? If a person in posses
sion of his wits had murdered his
family, leaving his brother unshbt,
would he leave the bodies in a room,
where there was no fire? If he had 1
set the house on fire to- cover the
crime would he not leave^ the bodies
in the flames to burn?"
The inquest will be resumed . to
morrow night.
Other witnesses who testified to be
ing present on the night of the fire
were John L. Predom, Moses G. Pre
dom, C. H. Morrow, J. C. Campbell and
J. F. Landis. Their testimony was Im
material:
EJ H. Elder testified that he was one
of the first to arrive, at the burning
home and as he rushed around the
house he met Adolph Weber and
asked: "Is there anybody in the
house? Are they upstairs or down
stairs?" Weber, he said, replied in an
unconcerned manner, "I don't know."
Weber then stepped back about four
feet from the house and threw a small
bundle against a window; smashing the
glass. The bundle went Into the burn
ing house. Weber then began kicking
the lower part of the window with his
heel. That was the last that Elder saw
of him until the fire had died out.
Dr.' R. E. Rooney, who had made an
examination of the victims after the
fire, reported the finding of bullets. in
their bodies. Mrs. Weber, he testified,
was shot twice. One bullet passed
through her body and was found in the
back, near the spine. . The other bullet
wound was found under her left arm
and the shot appeared to have been
fired from the back.
The examination will be resumed to
day.

There was not a ray of light; all was

and Ruth stumbled over something
which proved to be' the feet of

Lukens he lifted her up and bore
her. to the window. As the night breeze

did not do it." . .
Ruth- in conclusion said that, while he
held the child in his arms it was gasp

Guy Lukens followed and his testi
mony was mainly corroborative of that
given by Ruth. The sisters of the mur

Insure that has marked his bearing
and his manner since the day of the

LIKENS RUSSIANS TO DEMONS.
The husband of Haritena Korotkie
witch was serving at Port Arthur. In
endeavoring to Join him sne was stop
ped at Harbin and not allowed to pro
ceed farther, .owing to her sex. She
then donned masculine attire and suc
ceeded in reaching Port Arthur shortly
befc-re the landing of the Japanese on
the peninsula of Liaotung.
Finding her husband's regiment, she
enlisted in It. She participated in nu
merous sorties and in the defense of
the forts, and although her sex was
soon discovered, her record for bravery,
tirelessness . and attention to the
wounded and the excellent moral influ
ence Ehe exerted over me soldiers, who
never swore in her presence, won her
permission to remain in the ranks.
While fighting side by side with her
husband the latter was wounded. His
wife nursed him until the crisis in hib
case was passed, when she returned to
the front, where she became a messen
ger to Captain Gouzakofiky of the
Thirteenth Regiment. In the perform
ance of her duties as messenger she
was often seen riding fearlessly from
one pcrsition to another, seemingly un
affected by the bursting of shells or
the din of battle.
On October 13 she visited the trenches
with dispatches, when huge shells from
the Japanese guns struck and destroy
ed the Russian position. Haritena Ko
rotkiewitch and eight others were
killed. They were buried in one grave,
with the Russian flag wrapped around
Haritena's body. The Nova Krai con
cludes its story by saying:
"Haritena Korotkiewitch had won
the respect and admiration, not only of
the soldiers but of the higher officers
and had shown all how to die nobly."

12, copies of which were brought to

rotkiewitch, who, although a woman,
served valorously in many- fights at
Port Arthur until death closed her
strange career. The Nova Krai gives
many details regarding the adventures
of the woman, which combine to make

Juneau district. 'This action Is the re
sult of the Investigation of the Alaska

Judge Alfred C. Moore of the Nome

Attorney General Moody had a con

were 1 developed by an Investigation
which he made last summer was 'con

The Investigation made by Judge

the i case for many weeks, making a
special trip to Alaska to obtain In

It in the hands of the President. The
President's action was based on the
findings of Judge Day.
The nature" of the .charges against
the officials was not made publio in
detail, it being deemed advisable not
to publish at this time tha report made
by Judge Day. It Is known, however,
that the charges involved selfish, if not
corrupt, practices, before the Alaska
courts in mining claim cases.
The charges against Judge Brown,
who was appointed from Wyoming,
were in effect that he had a personal
interest In mining cases which were
before his. court and that he had ap
pointed his secretary as receiver of
some properties which were In litiga
tion. > '
Charges have been made from time
to time against "nearly all the Federal

being exempt, but It Is said* that the
action of the President to-day finally
closed the matter of the charges, offi

other officials involved In them have
acted In the best interests of the Terri

The loan was heavily oversubscrib
ed in London, but local bankers had
not hftard last evening how great an
interest was being taken in the bond
issue in the East. President Hellman
of the Nevada Bank stated the severe
storm which has played havoc with
the telegraph service along the Atlan
tic seaboard was probably responsib'o
for the lack of news on the subject.
II is expected that New York bankers
will loan money readily on the Japan
ese securities, as they are generally
considered a splendid investment. The
people of San Francisco have sub
scribed more numerously and for
larger amounts than was forecasted
by the financiers who negotiated the
loan.
A large number of applications for
Japanese bonds were made at the Ne

_Â«cr.ibed during, .the day amounted to
nearly $200,000. Most of the invest

ACTION BASED UPON
CONDUCT OF COURTS
The nature of the Russian fire indi
cates a scarcity of certain kinds of am
munition. All prisoners taken by the
Japanese tell a story of increasing
hunger. It is claimed that the Rus
sian commanders are divided on the
question of continuing the defense. If
this is true it fits the theory that the
Kastoropny carried dispatches passing
the question to the Emperor.
The general further stated that the
surrender report was all the more ridic
ulous as? several vessels had broken the
blockade and reprovisioned the garri
son. He added:
â¢"General Stoessel also knows that the
Second Pacific squadron is on its way."
TOK1O, Nov. 17 (9 a, m.).â The opin
ion is expressed here that the Russian
torpedo boat destroyer Rastoropny car
ried to Chefu extended dispatches ex
p'.aining to St. Petersburg the situation
at Port Arthur, the condition of the
Russian squadron and the shortage of
food and ammunition, referring the
question of further resistance to the
Russian Government.
A general who was with the Em
peror this afternoon and who knows
the contents of General StoeKtel's mes
sage said that all tbe talk, about Gen
oral Stoeasel asking for instructions to
surrender was absolutely false. He
said he was not at liberty to disclose
the nature of General Stoessel's report,
but he remarked:
"Only when the last biscuit Is eaten
and the last cartridge fired will the
garrison surrender the fortress. I can
state this positvely."
Considering the authority, the gen
eral's words may be accepted as a re
flection of the views of the Emperor
himstlf.
General Stoessel believes he will be
able to withstand the Japanese as
saults for sume time to come. The
blockade has been run by a ship 'with
a cargo of war munitions, food and
Ivspita! supplies. Some warships in
the harbor have been damaged by shell
fire, but not seriously. Many guns
have been removed from the ships and
mounted on shore, where large drafts

ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 17 (2 a- m.).
General Stoessel's report, conveyed id
Chefu from Port Arthur by the tor
pedo-boat destroyer Rastoropny, has
not been given out. but it has been
joarned that it contains no request for
instructions legarding the surrender of
Port Arthur. It Is intimated that the
report goes at considerable length into
the details of the recent fierce fighting.

was a sudden explosion and the de
stroyer sank immediately.
The launch then sped toward the
harbor." but was not pursued, the Jap
anese evidently not Jiaving observed
the launch and believing that the de
stroyer had struck one of their own
mines.
The Rastoropny carried sealed orders
providing that, unless there came a
highly favorable opportunity to escape,
the vessel should be blown up. Suffi
cient powder for this purpose was se
creted before the destroyer left Port
Arthur. Small charges of powder,
placed in each of the watertight com
partments, were exploded.
Two Japanese torpedo-boat destroy
ers were seen at the mouth of the har
bor to-night and their presence un
doubtedly precipitated the action of
the Russians in blowing up the Rasto
ropny.
The commander of the Rastoropny,
in an interview on his adventurous
voyage, said:
"I. left Port Arthur at midnight, in a
blinding snowstorm. The boat was
navigated through all the dangers of
floating, mines without a mishap. On
reaching the open sea, we saw a Jap
anese cruiser and some torpedo-boats
in the distance, but we were steaming
rapidly through the storm, with lights
extinguished, and passed them unno
ticed. We reached Chefu without mis
hap o-f any kind."
The commander of the torpedo-boat
destroyer was optimistic with reference
CHEFU, Nov. 17, 8a. m.â Three Jap
anese .torpedo-boat destroyers entered
the harbor this morning, satisfied
themselves that the Russian torpedo
boat destroyer Rastoropny had "been
sunk and departed.
CHEFU, Nov. 16.â The Russians to
day blew up the torpedo-boat destroyer
Rastoropny. The crew, with the ex
ception of one man, left the destroyer
during the afternoon. This last man
lighted slow fuses connecting with
powder etores. There were three dull
explosions, which were scarcely dis
cernible 100 yards from the place where
they occurred.. Almost simultaneously
the Rastoropny sank and settled on
the bottom. A single spar marks her
grave.
The Russian officers all sayÂ»the con
dition of Port Arthur is as good as it

roses, carnations and violets. There
are now annually sold In' this country
?6 000,000 to $7,000,000 worth of cut roses.
This represents something like 100,000,-

Government, which Is designed to and should
shelter the people living under It and guard
them in their rights of life, liberty and

will be plundered of both your rights and your
property, l.'nder the feudal law the common
people labored Incessantly, without reward, for
the benefit of the ruling classes to support
church and state and then to rive their lives
as soldiers in the frequent wars which rav
aged the land. Under our system but a small
contribution of time is necessary for the last
ing and permanent benefit of yourselves and
children. Shall you not give It? Tou are
simply asked t.> register an>] vote at "primary
and general elections; to vote with judgment
and discrimination moved by the common good
of all. You are tflked to serve on Juries and
election boards when called ca not oftener
than once In a year. Are these things a great
hardship? Tet there arÂ» many men who either
never register cr who absent themrelves from
the polls. They are not entitled to the pro
tection of the law. ,
DESTROYERS ARE DISARMED.
Universal suffrage, by which every male
c!tlÂ«n has one vote, to b# freely cast and
fairly counted, should, on the other hand. If
kept undefined, make the state immortal. By
liberty of conscience, speech and press" to
gether with fair elections, treason, rebellion,
ir.jurrection, turbulence, usurpation â the com
mon destroyers of statesâ ar e all disarmed.
Put the moat subtle enemy of free govern
ment must . be recognized in crlmss against
thir elective franchise, which contrive to pre
serve the form while they consume the sub
stance, and unless they are overcome a re
actionary feeling against republican Institu
tions !s inevitable, with anarchy and absolut
ism as alternatives.
Therefore the duties of the citizen toward
the 'state must be sirlously taken and per
formed with patriotic devotion- otherwise 'the

" Gavin McXab, whose years of ex
perience well fitted him to discuss the
subject assigned - him, "Practical . Poli
tics," followed Mr. Phelan. and his ad
dress : was most interesting. In part
he said:
A great philosopher has said that .the Meal
society is where every man is his own polict
maa and where -none othsr Is necessary. In
universal suffrage, where the citizen acts, he
become* his own politician and there is room
for ncne other. 'When all men vote at pri
maries -the practical politielan will be without
practice and the professional politician hunting
honest work. The boss Is the agent of the absent
voter, so constituted. by neglect cf duty. The
only practical politics I know consists In vot
ing. On the -theory that there are more good
men than bad men. if all men vote the govern
ment "will" be honest. The rule of the profes
sional politician is -minority -rule. It is de
pendent on the refusal or neglect of the ma
jority to act. .The man who is absent from
the polls gives the man who goes there permis
sion and power to nominate any kind of man
he sees fit. If private affairs were treated as
political matters are managed everybody would
be Insolvent. It is no wonder that we are face
to face with bankruptcy of public decency

The preliminary work of securing delegates) is
little. Mcst of the work of primary party or
ganization has not other object than getting
people to the polls. If the public is educated
to the point of Insuring' attendance the forma

conditions has no confidence that- hiÂ» fellow

practical politician. generally called the
"push." has Â¦ a confidence born cf experience
that the Â¦ irood citizen will not comer â¢ When

Once cpon a time there was an election the

James D. Phelan was next Intro
duced and he was greeted with a flat

evident that he had given the subject
assigned to him, "The Citizen's Duty
to the State." the fullest thought, for
his address was one of excellence. In
part he said:
APPLAUSE FOR PHELAX.
T"hes* are facts that rmuhasize the neces
sity of an awakening: of our Â¦ people to the
need of reform in political conditions In large
municipal it iw. ?<%'Â» '
Are you aware, my friends, that there are
mor? than a. dozen cities In thin country to
day the municipal expenses cf which are more
than the total exnensn of runntn* the gov
err.-nent of the State.ln wliich th'-y are located?
Are you aware that the city of New York
raises to-day by taxation for municipal ex
pfn?rÂ« mrrt than did imperial Rome In her
palmiest days?
Are you aware that It cents mere to run th
city *orernmÂ«r.t Â¦ Â«f New .Tork than' It does
the civil eaveremtEt- of the t'-nited' States?
This sirt of thinx v.i may well conclude,
however, wilt always exist, and wir hope
Bhcu'd be to minimize rather than to elim
inate It: but that it Can be minimized there
is no <iueÂ»tion. and this leads us to consider
ths second class of citizens to which allusion
has been mad*-, namely, th^s? tvhc*Â« faults in
connection with taotr exercise of the ri*ht of
euSrase and the discharge cf their duty as
citizens at the polls are those of omission.
And I am sorry to ?ay that this class Is
large, ani is made up of the beat men In
evtry community.
Why. Mr. PrÂ»*!der.t. â¢ It hÂ«<! enrne to be a
fixed and settled hailt of business and pro
fessional men to permit practical politicians
before 2nd at the primaries to select the men
and name the ticket for which they are to
vcte losing sight cf the Ixr.pertant fact that
the referendum when shcrn of Us initiative is
robbed of much of It* practical value.
Honest. u;.rirht men are In the majority In
men if not all. cf the districts of this and
other cities, but they leave politics to the Irre
sponsible, urarrlcal politician, and hence I say
they csnnct escar>e r<sronsibility for the de
plorable conditions whi<-h to-day surround the
exsreise or the right of suffrage all over our
land. A condition that If unrestrained Is al
lowed to fasten Us*If upon our body politic
mujt; constitute a menace to the life of this
republic.

IrC-JencA or by casting, their own baleful in
fluence over weak or dishcneit voters. In
other words, their highest conception of this
great privilege, this right to have a voice In
th; makir.g of he laws by which we are gov
erned, is to exerci?e that right without thought
or reference to the sacred obligations which
should surnunj its use or to the conÂ«quences
entailed by the pmper or improper discharge
a: their duty as citizens at the polls.
for th?m. by personal solicitation or by com
munication through the mail9.- When public
Interest In civic affairs is active communication
through the mails Is most effective. It may
be. made by a committee of well-known men,
who communicate by circular . letter the ob
jects for which the nominees stand, you will
find that the battle is, â¢ not so -much to get
men to vote right as, to.gef. them to vote at
all. Once you are eure m>n will vote you
have only to convince them that tha city's
welfare requires them to vote your way and
you. will g-et most of them.
Although a cynical person who observed an
election in San Francisco once said that Jf
he believed, the .voice of the people was the
voice >of God it would make him an lnfldel,
the voice of the people is. for the right and
the good. There is, therefore, no practical pol
itics like that of convincing men that to at
tend primaries Is the command cf political
righteousness; that their neglect raeans the
abandonment of the city's best Interests to
Its worst people.
Herbert Spencer says that the Greeks did
not wait for Aristotle to write his logic be
fore they reasoned. â When the pÂ«-ople are in
earnest they win without direction from poli
ticians. The question Is one of keeping the
public conscience warm and the public mtnd
clear. There Is no rule of politics save the
rule of action.
The motive sower in polities is public opin
ion. That is the man behind the gun. Per
haps if the man with the gun would practice
more he would aim better and oftener hit the
tar~et.
The issue is, rhall San Francisco be a po
litical pig Â«tye of the honored home of hon
est men and women. Tou citizens are the
Jury. There are enough men in this room. If
they will act together for a year, to purify
and regenerate our civic life. Action Is the
key to Buccesw. Since Adam stood alone on
thÂ« morning of the sixth day confronted by
the destinies of his race, there has been no
finer spectacle than the American in action
The situation calls for united action.

MAESTRETTI INTERFERES.
Mr. Jcoeph Rebstock, one of the election of
ficials," refuted to put the oath to these men.
I told him It was the right of. every citizen to
challenge a vote on that ground, but Rebstock
enly sneered acd eaid he wouJd see himself in
San QuÂ«ntin before he wculd put tha oath to
any of thosn about to vote. Â¦ While we were
axsruing Commissioner Maestretti appeared; He
was indignant when he saw me and said: "Get
out of bÂ«re'. What right have you in an elec
tion beeth?'!
Then llaestretti went orer to'th* Almshouse
and had â¢ a .: talk, with Frank Schmitt. the
sui-erintendsnt, .-and brother of our Mayor
who said :'. "I .want you to understand that I
will -not .have .any/one abuse those paupers,"
and punctuated his sP'sech -with a few choice
administration oaths. . S^hmltz and MaeVrett!

helu a consultation near the booth. Whenever

No truer note for the public good
has been sounded since the Vigilantes'
bell called them to arms to uphold the
Ian- than that at the Palace Hotel last
evening, where 436 members and
fner.ds of the Merchants' Association
4Â»f San Francisco gathered to discuss
"The citizen's duty at the polls.'
It was the seventh annual banquet
of the association, butÂ« pleasure and
the strengthening of the ties of friend
ship were not its most important re
sults. It again made known to the
public the associations object in be
cotninff a. factor in municipal politics.
This cbject, as explained by its
e^ealters. is one that must meet with
Tiide indorsementâ the toppling from
high places the despoilers of the pub
lic treasury, the dethroning of the
bosses that have degraded the city j
and the scattering, of the- flocks of
political harpies that follow In their
wake to gather the crumbs that fall.
Patriotism for the city, the State and
the nation prevailed and the demand i
for justice and honesty in public office |
met u ith great continued applause. The |
men that gathered at the board were ]
representative of every solid interest of j
the city and formed a body that at a
glance showed the power it can wield
in the fieht it has inaugurated for right.
Facing, as San Francisco does, a fu
ture that is full of promise with mil
lions voted by the people for the im
provement and adornment of the city,
the subject selected for discussion was
most appropriate. And the subdivi- !
eions of the subject were also happily j
arranged to give the question its full- ,
rst scope. To James D. Phelan was as- j
signed "The Citizen's Duty to the
State," H. D. Loveland spoke on "The
Citizen's Duty to the City." Gavin Mc-
Nab en 'Practical Politics" and Fair
fax H. Wheelan on "Primary Experi
ences." Each of the speakers had much
of interest to tell and if their philoso
phy is followed the gain will be not
only that of the citv. but of all the
SWEtrriN'G STATEMENTS.

HONEST municipal government, civic pride and civic progress are the great objects for' which the Merchants' Associa

EASTERN DELEGATES VISIT.
A suit was begun yesterday by At
torney Isaac Joseph, representing P.
Bacigalupi. to compel I. Magnin &
Co. to give him a renewal, of a lease
of five years on the three-storv build
ing at 840 Market street. He leased
the property in March. 1901, at $300
a month, and was to have the privi
lege of renewal of five years from
October 1, 1905, provided he gave
a year's notice. On October 1 last he
was In New York and did not give the
notice until November ,5, when the
renewal was refused. Bacigalupi says
he has spent nearly $8000 In Improv
ing the building. This is said to raise
a point In law that has never been,
settled.
Wants Lcaso Renewed.

-. - Secures , Admission.
There was no lack of speeches Jn

serve as a delegate." .There were at

If. in accordance with the 'decision of Â¦ the
American Federation of- Labor,' Mr. Mangan
had withdrawn from the steamfltters organiza
tion instead of continuing In the suspended
body, and then had Joined some other organiza
tion that had accepted him to | membership- I
would have supported the report of the. com
mittee to seat him.'" But In view of the fact
that he Is still a member of the suspended
local and continues .his : membership there tÂ»hd
efforts are made" to 'maintain and sustain the
suspended organisation, I* move that we cannot
afford to establish a precedent of- seating dele-
. A good reason why Mr. Mangan ehould be
excluded from this convention . Is that he la a
member and has been a member of an organiz
ation that haÂ»- been suspended from this or
ganization and we cannot afford, to establish
tho precedent of seating in this convention, . or

of Labor, men I who- are suspends^,- or whose

sarcastically: "I desire to be inform

day with credentials trom an> association of
astronomers as trom the' florists. Mr. Mangan
may at one time have cultivated gardens or
cultivated roses, but I have never heard that
he did. And I think we should be sincere
with each other. J !WÂ« are trades unionists wao
served our time at a trade, served our time
to learn it; and in order to be Interested- In
it we must be associated with it constantly,
always. Â¦
We are here representing one craft. It Is
true that men have acquired a- knowledge of
two trades; It Is very true; and they may come
here with credentials from one of those trades;
but there are circumstances involved here
Â¦which cloud the question* and to the disad
vantage to Mr. Mansran, because it Is a wellr
known fact that for the last four years he
has come to conventions without credentials, to
work , in the interests of tbe steam and gas
fitters. Now let us be sincere with \ each
other. ' Do you want 'to use him for a vote?
Do you want to use him for a purpose that
you have- not yet'reveaJed? Or do you want
to use him because he served his 1 time as Â¦, a
florist? We could Dut this to the test if we
wished, guppose you go out and buy a bouquet
for $ip or. f20 and let the* gentleman mount
the stage and display the difference between
the flowers that grow in Chicago aad the
flowers that grow here. (Laughter.)
Now I will say this : " I am a friend of Mr.
Mancan and always have been, and he can't
deny It. And you must not try to win any
sympathy by saying that It Is personal. The
only personal feeling that I have in it. Is that
I regret that Mr. Mangan 'and hi* friends
should make 'such an effort as this; to -come
here claiming to represent the florists, when,
he has been known always as a full-fledged,
hard-handed casfltter or. steamfltter. . It' la all
the same â steam, gas and hot air.

Tour committee, after careful consideration
of the testimony and evidenoe presented by
both sides, finds that thÂ« only good ground
submitted by M*Â»snÂ». Clark, McKean and
8pencer against the seating of Delegate Man
gan I* the claim that he is sot eligible to
membership In the organization^ which he has
btcn elected to represent. In . that he is now
employed as a steamfitter and was at the
time that he was admitted to membership
In the Florists' Union. This, however, your
committee felt was not for them to decide.
The evidence in the hands of your committee
shows that Mr. Mangan is now and was at
the time of his election a member of the afore
said Florists' Union. TnÂ« questloa as to . what
means wtrÂ« employed to wure membership
aad election as a delegate to this convention
from tbe Florists' Union Is for the convention
to deal with rather than this committee. As
a credential* committee we only recognise the
fart that Mr. Mangan is now. and was at thÂ»
time of his election, according to the evidence
a member In good standing In the organiza
tion he has been elected to represent, said
union being a bona-flde one. Wo therefore
recommend that Delegate Mangan be accorded
a eÂ«at In this convention.
The credentials of John Mangan Â¦Â»tre
referred back to your committee . for further
Investigation In rtferenc* to his membership
in Gardeners', and Florists' Union No. 10,615.
The committee finds the credentials of John
Manr&n from* tbe Gardeners' and' FiorlctV
Union 'of Chicago were issued In proper form
and signed and Â«ealÂ«d by proper officers. In
proof of his membership Mr. Mansran presents
hla duly ?!rr.Â« d and ttaled working card for the
past Quarter. WÂ« have corroborative testimony
from John Fltzpatrick of Chicago, represent
ing the Homeshoers' International Union,' to
the effect that he personally knows that Mr.
Mangan is a ssember of the. said FloricU'
Union and was duly elected a delegate to
represent the said union tn this convention.
Mesirs. John Clark*. Jsmes J. MeKean and
William J. St>encer appearfd before your
cemmittee and protested against the seating
of Delegate Mangan on the ground that if he
Is a member ot the Florists' Union he is not
eligible, as they have no personal knowledge
that hÂ« ever worked as a gardener or flor
ist, which be would necessarily have- to have
done to obtain membership; and that he is
a member of the SteamStterrf Union, which
union has been suspended from the American
Federation of Labor; and charge that he is
using a membership In the Florists' Union
wrocjrfully and an a subterfuge on behalf of
the SteamfUters' Union, and that he Is using
dishonest methods of securing election to this
convention.
The basis of the entire proceedings
was ihe report of the committee on cre
dentials, which had an investigation
Tuesday evening. The text of the re
port is as follows:

The fight over the position of Schardt,
the prebident of thÂ« Chicago Federa
tion of Labor and incidentally the Etat
us of the preat organization of 200,000
members that he represents, waa set
dov.-n for hearing end discussion on the
convention floor yesterday. Schardt
ha* been turned down by' the creden
tials committee cf the^conventlon.
The committee refused to eeat him
end turned the entire matter over to
the convention a* a whole to settle.
Now Schardt's Chicago federation is
in trouble on account of ltÂ« action in
regard to tbe very same Chicago steam
fitters that figured to furnish a reason
for- opposition to Mangan. The Schardt
case would have followed that of Man
gan yesterday, but noon was near and
there wns evidently not time to thrash
it out Â»>cÂ£ore the recess, therefore it
was agreed to make It a special order
for to.day. to follow another special
crder. which is ihe reception of greet
ings from the' British and Canadian
delegate* to the convention tn behalf
cf their constitnents, ;
After Mangan was seated B. Cohen
â¢ Secretary Morrison took ft long time
to count the votes. After the first roll
call he went carefully over the Hit of
voters, again calling the names of the
delegates and verifying the accuracy of
his checking. Then be requested a
short time to count and was granted
U. During the noise and smoke of the
battle at least one man In the house
v.as entirely imperturbable, at least
outwardly, and that was Mangan.
When the result waa announced and he
was admitted, became forward from
the r.-ar of the hall, stood at the gate
that has been placed at the lower end
of the hall and there, with a voice as
soft as sHk, thanked the convention
and said* that he hcrped to prove worthy
of the confidence that had been mani
fested in him.' â¢ â¢ .
Very different In â¢â¢' tntent from the
smooth and euave uucrance of Man

tnade the fight against his admission.
Generally It v.as said by those in op
poeition that they, did -not object to
Mangan but to the principle of opening
the door to let him in with all that is
involved. . .. } Y-
Tlu; battle on thla issue was long and
lively. Considerable parliamentary
practice preceded and gave Delegate
Abraham, the oldest living member of
the British Parliament, an Idea of what
can be done in an American labor con
vention. The air was balmy outcide,

In this particular case. If In no other that
Is to follow, there Is collusion. To my under
standing this Florists' Union is a very small or
ganization, recently organized, and in that time
there is no fair-minded man who can say that
that . organization has found enough business
to jirc-scnt it3elf here at this convention, nor
has it b~rn able. In a natural way, to secure
such An able - representative as relegate Man

tion of Labor will accept delegates from au

pended from our national organisation and
through this subterfuge can serk eyual rights
upon the floor of the American Federation of

Â¦ It Is my opinion that the repreÂ»sntatlvÂ» from

from the steamfltters of Chicago. I do not
raise the- point that Delegate Mangan's work

which I stated yesterday: that he secured his
admission into the Florists' Cnlon and presents
hlrr.self hÂ«re nominally as the delegate from
the florists, but principally as the representa
tive of the orsaniiation of steamfltters,
. Delegate Leonard asserted that "an
unafflliated union attempts to be rep
resented by a member that cannot,
because of suspension, represent his
own organization. For- this reason
the delegate should not be seated."
The Massachusetts delegates met

of them was .that a man may. know
two trades and that the convention -of
the American Federation â¢ of Labor
had not the right to go back of cre
dentials Jo a delegate that were issued
by an organization that, was entitled
to be represented. . . .
Just as soon as "question" was
called a motion was made to have a
vote by roll call.. President Gompers
decided that fprty hands were. held up
by as many delegates, "more than
one-tenth of the delegates to this con
vention," in sign of a desjre for a roll
cajl.. The vote was taken with the
result already told. For many a day
the entire transaction will be discussed
and a study of- the vote will be mads
in connection with the list of dele
gates by the followers of the labor
cause. ' \
In accordance with the recommen
dations of th'e committee on creden

At noon a recess was taken in order
that, a trolley ride to all - principal
points of interest in the city might.be
taken by the delegates, on invitation
of the local committee. This threw
over practically all the other business
of the day so far as the transaction of
it In ODen convention was concerned.
President Gompeira suggested and the
idea was adopted of holding evening
meetings of all the committees. Prac
tically all the convention leaders were
therefore kept busy last night.

of the ptlv'Vges, Pome of the labors, some of
Vxn reÂ»r-<'iis'lllities of thla convention. They
rxneet to do eo. or they . would not have paid
Mr. Mangan's salary here. "
Mr. Mangan was askM " this question last
night, imoni others. -.and refused to answer
the questloa whsther he had received his ex
penses from Lccal No. 2 or not. - I set out,
Mr. Chairman, that Mr. Mangan is not now nor
has he been a member of the florists' organ
ization, and, since he is not a member cf that
organization, he la not qualified for member
ship in this convention.-. That union is not
privileged to furnish Mr. Mangan with a ere-'
dentlal to the American Federation cf Labor.
For that .reason, and again for the reason that
Mr. Mangan. la resorting to a certain subter
fuge unworthy of Â¦ him â positively unworthy cf
-him â this convention ehould not accept the
report cf the committee., , - : .
If Mr. Mangan it a eteamfitter; and has
b<Hrri employed for the last three months aa a
ntt-nn-.HUer. then I am here to Bay. Mr. Chair
man, that he does not quaiiry for membership
in tue Gardeners' and Florists' Union. And I
further want to say that if this union accepted
_Mr. Manse n knowing when accepting him that
h.' wan employed as a steamfltter and not as
a florist of gardener, this union is not entitled*
to a delegate In this convention. ,- . .--
It 1* not the admission to . thljs convention
Of Mr. Mangan that we object to; it is the'es
tabiishrr.ent of a precedent*, that will â¢ be- Icl

cedent this morning. - , .-. Â¦ â¢ -
Returning again, however, to the standing
of Mr. Mangan in the Florists' Union, 1 want
to say this and I want you to take it home
to yourselves. 1 would like to say that in
appearing before the- committee la*t evening
I subjected .Mr. Mangan to a series of cross
questions and among others 1 asked Mr. Man
i?an how long he had been a. member of the
Gardeners' and Florists' Union ot Chicago.
Mr, Mangan* was unable to state the date of
his a<JrclÂ»Â«lon. . 'Â¦ . -
Think of It, ray friends, a roan cannot rec
ollect the*day he joined the union, the union
that he comes here representing! He cannot
recollect the day that he first accepted mem
bership in the organisation! In a general way
he said. "I have been a member of this union
within the last three months." -. Sow, follow
me: If Mr. Menpan joined the Gardeners',
and FlorUrts* Union within the I last three
months, he must necessarily have been a gar
dener or a florist. In order to U-comÂ« > mem
ber or a union hÂ« must qualify for membership
in that he mutt "represent that trade. Then,
if Mr. Mangan has been employed as a gar
dener or Corist within the tyst three months
I want to eay to you that he has-been receiv
ing his salary from -the city of Chicago â¢Â¦ a
steamfltter during this time. Mr. Mangan
is a steamfltter in the employ of the city of
Chicago, and has been receiving, his -salary
from the city of Chicago for the last number
cf years and not working as' a florist or gar
dener at all. ... Oi Btqi Â¦
to concur in the report and then the
ball was set to rolling and continued
to roll for a long time. "Spencer said
in part in support of his motion:
Â¦I. hold that Mr. Mangan is , not Qualified

ists' Vnicn of Chicago. ,. 1 want; however, to
dlettbuse the minds of tee delegates, if they

The delegate who headed the fight
against Mangan is Vice President Spen
cer. As the matter is explained by
delegates. '^spemrer belongs to one or
ganization of plumbers Jn Chicago' an4
Mangan another. While Mangan is
rated as a steamfltter, his organization
includes plumbers. Siangan... so-, say
delegates, is connected with the na
tional organization that i6- not' recog
nized by the American Federation, an<1
rpencer Is a member of the 'recognized
international. Mangan la a clever and
able talker, whether he- will take part
in the Schardt-Chicago federation mat
ter to-day from the point of a] steam
fitter was a subject for speculation
among the friends of Sper.cer last even
ing. Allegation is made by a delegate
that Cohen, having credentials from
Kewanee, 111., had his expenses to San
Francisco paid by steamfitters J and
that he was expected to take part in
the Schardt fight before the conven
tion, until he dropped out finally yes
terday as a delegate.
While the Mangan battle raged yes
torday readiness as public* speakers
was discovered to be the gift of many.
The audience was occasionally In hu
morous mood. Laughs followed sharp
thrusts. An idea of the proceedings
against Mangan may be best presented
by sample extracts from | speeches,
etenographically reported, of those in
opposition.
was turned down by the credentials
committee. Cohen came with creden
tials from Kewanee, JlL.but the mem
bfrs of the credentials committee
could not see that he was entitled to
tit. -
and also accredited to their own con
vention of Electrical Workers of the
Pacific Coast, which body is also hold
ing its annual convention In this city.
' Machinists' Lodge No. 68 was visited
at Machinists' Hall, 1159 Mission
street, by International President
James O'Connell of Washington. D. C,
end four other delegates, all of whom
made short addresses, highly compli
mentary to the local men cennected
with the machinists of this city.
Although there were delegates of
prominence in all the cars, ihe main In
terest was centered in the car in which
President Gompers rode. Accompanying
the president were the fraternal dele
gates of Great Britain. Wlgnall anct
Abraham and their wives, Mahon and
Cornelius- of the Street Railway Em
ployes, D. A. Hayes of the executive
council and delegates from "Washing
ton,. New York and Maryland. The
local people who acted as escort to. the
president's party were: John E. Mc-
Dougald. City Treasurer; Michael
Casey and O. A. Tvietmoe. The presi
dent's car was in charge of Motorman
J. A. Bergstrand and Conductor J. J.
Regallo.
The first point of Interest to the vis
itors was the old Mission Dolores. Here
the cars stopped while the occupants
gazed long at the old walls that shel
tered the padres In bygone years. To
the English delegates In particular this
spot appealed.
The car carrying President Gompers
and his party followed the park line
and the visitors expressed admiration,
at the beautiful foliage and flowers.
Many audibly recalled the fact that
there were severe wire-breaking? storms
in the East and . regretted that their
business would compel their return.
The day was an ideal one at the Cliff
House and the delegates positively re
fused to return to the city after the*
hour allotted had passed. Up and down
along the sands and through the Sutro
park were small parties of delegates,
and when the last special car left many
were still at the beach.
The entire body of delegates with
possibly a few exceptions started out
from the headquarters at the Russ
House at l:30 # ln ten special cars and
covered the regular observation route.
Car after car filled with the delegates
passed through the city's streets while
members of the local committee pointed
out the places of Interest-
Crossing back over FUlniore street,
the party separated, one division of
cars going to the Cliff House by way of
the Sutro, and the other by way of the
park and beach line. When the Cliff
House and seal rocks were reached the
entire party was so much impressed
with the beauty and grandeur of the
scene that the allotted stop of one hour
was lengthened Indefinitely. The cars
were compelled to wait until strag
gling parties came back. Many dele
gates even remained at the beautiful
pleasure spot so long that they were
compelled, to board the regular cars
returning.* â¢
The delegates to the American Fed
eration of Labor Convention yesterday
took advantage of the opportunity of
fered by the local committee and the
United Railroads Company, and with
their wives spent a pleasant afternoon
viewing San Francisco's many points of
Interest.
The leading insiders In the American
Federation of Labor were "thrown
down" yesterday by a roll call vote In
Eyrie Ha!L In cpponltlon to the votes
of such leaders a* Samuel Goraper*.
John Mitchell, James Duncan and Wil
liam J. Epencer, a man was given a
seat on the convention floor who has
been a member of the organization of
Chicago eteamfitters that is ostracized
by the American Federation and, ac
cording to allegations on the floor,
spoken in heated debate and not denied,
â¢who came to San Francisco at the ex
pense of the same Chicago steamfltters.
I>elegate John Mangan of Chicago, who
is accredited as a "florist." Is the man
who won- On the roll call the vote on
seating h!m as a delegate was 7652 in
favor and 7SS7 against.
â¢^ There are not 15.0C9 delegates in the
convention as might be inferred by the
casual reader from the total number of
votes that were polled on roll call.
Under the syetem of voting, the several
delegations to the convention are en
titled to cast" votes in proportion to
their membership. So the mine work
ers, btaded by Mitchell, can cast 2557
votes; the plumbers. Spencer'e dele
gation, 165; the machinists. 627; the
longshoremen. 500; the meat cutters,
244; the molders, 200;. the musicians,
220; painters, 607; barbers, 236; boiler
makers, 190; boot and shoe workers, 320;
carpenters and Joiners, 1554; cigarmak

workers, 210; garment "Workers, "4%(: ho- '.

men, 201; Typographical Union, 4f7.
I Many delegations cast a. Jess number*
of votes and a large number of dele
gates have but one vote each to cant.
The minority in which Gomr>ers, Spen
cer. Mitchell and their followers found
themselves when the votes were count
ed was 285. There were splits in the
delepatlons. In this way knowledge
t*&*. gained that Gompers voted against

divided. A rail from the floor for In
formation brought out the statement
from Secretary Morrison that Gompers

qualified to sit with full powers to act, a right that is won after a roll-call ballot, in which history is made for all participants who are parties to the proceedings. Many speeches are made and open accusations of trickery are

another place she got a warrant for
their arrest. Thomas Leggett cannot
account for the actions of his aunt.
He says Mrs. Herman drinks three
quarts of whisky every day.

been incarcerated. They are far from

A dispatch from Shanghai dated
October 13 reported a three days' flght
between Chinese troops and rebels at
IÂ»chen;?ahien, one of the towns men
tioned in the foregoing cablegram, in
which a large body of rebels was de
feated.
It is understood that. the new treaty
to be proposed by the administration
will seek to cultivate friendly trade re
lations with China, without throwing
the doors wide open to the coolies..
When China decided to conclude the
existing treaty Senators and Represen
tatives from the Pacific, Coast were ex
cited. The Pacific Coast legislators in
sisted that the abrogation of the treaty
would cause the treaty relations of
China and America regarding immigra
tion to revert to the Berlin treaty, en
acted several decades ago. It provided
that Immigration between the two
countries 8hould\>e "free and unre
stricted."
On the ground that reversion to this
treaty would cause an inrush of coolies
from Mexico" and Canada between De
cember 8 and the earliest day the Sen
ate could ratify a new treaty, the Pa
cific Coast Senators and Representa
tives sought prohibitive legislation by-
Congress. The leaders advocated giv
ing the President charge of the matter.
The President asked for Attorney Gen
eral Knox's opinion as to whether the
Immigration law . of 1903 would hold
after the abrogation of the treaty.
Knox advised that additional legisla
tion be enacted by Congress. The ef
fort of Congress to dodge responsibility
was accordingly frustrated and In the
closing days of the. session an act was
passed re-enacting all previous exclu
sion, without regard to treaties. Pan
ama was specifically excepted from the
exclusion policy, so that Chinese labor
may be employed in digging the canal.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. Nov. 16.â Although the
existing Chinese- American immigration
treaty will expire on December 8, the
officials declare there is no danger of
an influx of coolie labor. The ChinesÂ©
Government "six months ago gave no
tice that It. would abrogate the treaty
on December 8. in the hope of obtain
ing a convention more favorable to the
admission of merchants, students and
officers. President Roosevelt is favor
able to a mare liberal treaty. regard-
Ing the extension of such privileges to
Chinese as a good way to win com
mercial favor In return. The policy of
the exclusion of coolies, will not be
changed in any way.

As some of President Roosevelt's
critics claim to have discovered, after
reading his letter of acceptance, that
while he Is peaceful enough now he is
preparing for war. It may be interest
ing to call their attention to the fact
that the army, so far from being in
creased, is of less strength than it was
the summer before he succeeded to the
Presidency. The actual strength of the
regular army, including the hospital
corps, the Porto Rico regiment and the
Philippine scouts, was. June 30. 1901,
2940 officers ana 78,646 enlisted men; to
tal, 81,686. At the close of the last fis
cal year. June SO, 1904, it was estimated
at 69,836. Though this is. an estimate,
it is not likely that the completed re
turns will materially change these fig
ures. For a man who Is preparing for
war the President Is following a most
peculiar method in reducing the organ
ised military force of the country.â

There is a form of self-advertisement
which proves even more pointedly than
commercial advertisement the wonder
ful potency of assertion. It is some
thing far subtler than what we have
been discussing and appeals to a imail
er and more select public In. this case
the deception goes further, hut It. Is
necessary to. obtain the full effect that
a person who makes the assertion
should himself believe in its .truth. TbÂ«
power to deceive with wh4ch the self
deceived are often endowed is remark
able. .' . Â«
By countless assertions a stupid man
can convince himself. This is why. un- %

There Is nothing: more extraordinary
than the effect "produced by relteratfon
upon the public mind. Almost any non

Oakland Club Includes in Its membership many
women who are blessed with both artistic and
executive ability. Since the club has occupied

expand tholr talents, with the gratifying re

brilliant succtAse* and the organisation Itself,

Amid the jeers and mock applause
of the undir-class men of the univer
sity, the seniors who take military in
struction from Captain J. T. Nance
marched according to orders into his
classroom in North Hall this after
noon. ''
Two weeks ago the same students
rebelled against Nance's requirement
that they form In line in the roadway
before the hall and march quietly into
his classroom. At that time arnob
took possession of the roadway, hoot
ing and jeering Professor W. A. Set
chell, who tried to quiet them, and
preventing any who wished to obey
Nance's order.
Captain Nance at once ordered all
suspected of complicity In the affair to
make explanations to him, or be
dropped from the class and lose their
degrees. His investigation is still in
progress. â¢ r
The effect of the inquiry upon the
temper of the students was noticed to
day, when the time for marching Into
classroom came. The seniors formed
ir. lines, under the direction of section
monitors, and .arched into the build
ing. Sophomores and freshmen
shouted in derision, but jj the seniors
took their medicine quietly, while
Captain Nance watched the procession
from his classroom window upstairs,
smiling approval at the spectacle.
- The under-class men then dispersed,
without further demonstration.

The second "processus" introduced
the three Magi, who, with ingenious
tymboliKm, were represented as black,
red and white men respectively. In
Fiuh mood was one by this time that
the shift from the palpable Engllsh-
MSl of the first act to the Oriental ism
cf the second was accepted with utter
trustfulness. Splenidd pictures were
the three Eastern potentates and

As easily as you and I think the other.
It is possible .that Professor Gayley
has not sufficiently modernized the vo
cabulary of the play. Still, a public
that accepts its opera in Italian hur,
ii â¢ ri^ht to cotni Itfii of a sood, old
F; too phraiso crVvo. Besic*e*-, the talc
if--dt= feu- v.< ? :\f. Jt is as undÂ£rÂ»:ind
'abie to-day as it was to the simple
sightseer ot Chaucer's time, to which
it belongs.
Firs-t come from behin-i. the hall
singing an ancient carol, the good
derkcnweU monks. They march
ihrouprh the audience to the eta?e, that
represents the Clerkenwell Priory. Still
Enging, they go behind the scenes and
climb to the gallery. Comes Gabriel
then. One is grateful to the Greet
players for many beautiful nictures.
Here is one of the most beautiful.
. The central curtains divide, to reveal
the figure of Gabriel, star-crowned, in
a mar.tle of wonderful blue, lilies in
band and with the exquisitely rp'titudl
face Constance ..'muley ci\i bnns to
the picture. Gabriel plays througb
pui something of the part of the Creek
chorus, foretelling and explaining the
feisty, and one knows what tfi-2 Craw
ley voice can do for that.
The tale of the thieving shepherd,
Mak, ttkes up the beginning of the
p'.vy. It is one cf the earliest examples
of English comedy, shrewdly interest
ing and naively humorous. Mak Joins
Ulv ttoree shepherds that see the star
.<jf Bethlehem. He steals one cf their
*heerÂ». Gyll. his wife, fuaringr dis
covery, puts the wether in the cradle,
pretending it is a new-born child The
lhrÂ»:e sbcrherds come. The groans of
Gyll and the rrote?tations of Mak de
ceive the "herds." They go. But one,
out of pity for the poverty of the
'corr-le. proposes to !eav<: gifts for the
child with a kisÂ«. The wether is dis
cevtred ami Mak is tossed in a' blanket
for his sir.s. The whole story, told in
vigorous and terse English, is of
strong historic value and in itself es
sentially dramatic. Mr. Greet was a
highly humorous figure as Mak and
the other shepherds were alsq admir
ably undertaken by their unlabeted ex
â¢pcnentR. -r- \
As every one kn<ivvs, the play was
writtenâ or rather compiled â by Profes
sor Charles Mills Gayley, from a num
ber cf old English miracle plays. Ben
Or*-ct and his company of English play
ot>\ for whom the compilation was
made, produced it yesterday afternoon
for the first time here. Boston, how
ever, saw the first production, Mr.
Oreet having given the play there in
September. For his chief material Pro
fessor (Jayley has gone to the Towneley
plays, in chjef the "Secunda Pastorum"
dnd the "Offering of the Magi." The
York, Chester and Coventry cycles have
als<> been drawn upon, and several
original scenes, mo5t cteverly charac
tered, have also I5<ien adSed by the
dramatist. Song? of the period add a
further interest, and the quaint, rhym
ing measure a further charm.
A rroudly set turbaned head, a face
of ebony lifted toward the evening star,
a figure, kingly fashioned and garbed
in strange and gorgeous Eastern gar
ments, dark against an Oriental sunset,
was my last picture of the "The Star
of Bethlehem." It was difficult to be
lieve oneself in Berkelev. in the uni
versity grounds, in the twentieth cen
tury, in yesterday afternoon in fact,
end one of a crowd that had just seen
the play in the Harmon Gymnasium.
The figure belonged to the player of
JaFper, one of the three kings that
brought gifts to the infant Jesus. He
had walked out of the play into the
University <;f California grounds, and
not he, royally striding along with his
cilent attendant at his heels, looked out
cf the picture, but 'the prosaic rest
of us. One felt there should have been
camels and a caravan, instead of elec
tric cars at the corner, and â but one
might just as well "pay at once that
â¢The Star of Bethlehem" has atmos
rhtre. an atmosphere that reaches over
where the footlights should be to the
t&Tthttt corner of the theater, and lasts
for at least five minutes outside of it.
So persuasive is the quaint mediaeval
ism of the thing that for the time one
etands reverent ami agape, like those
that ptood '*y Clerkenwell Priory
watching these plays some seven or
eight ceniuri<Â»s ago.
scene Is the appearanco of Herod's
messenger, ivho overhears their story.
The next scene shows Herold himself,
surrounded by soothsayers prophesy
ing the birth of the new King. One is
sorry to see so % little of him. so admir
ably is the tyrant portrayed by John
Sayer Crawley.
I had not thought to see anything
more naively funny than the "Dante"
hell that the St. Ignatians evolved a
v.eek or two agro. But there is a fun
nier inferno here. Herod summons
the devils to help him â little red ones
that remind Of the deviled ham 'pic
tures â arid there is a dragon that de
lights oven more. Grau's isn't in it.
Yet one accepts the trustful beast
without reserve!
The last scene concerns itrelf with
tlje nativity. Here again is a picture
and climax of singular and touching
beauty, exquisitely reverent and im
pressive. â¢Â¦ The curtains â the.se, of
course, at the back of the stage â open
to show the Madonna, l?aning over a
iradle from which comes the light
that illumines the scene. By her side
me Joseph, Gabriel, the maid Ancilla
and In the front the Magi rind the
shepherds, who in turn "offer gifts.
One would have preferred â the illu
sion was a little destroyed thereby â
that the Madonna had not spoken.
Better, too, would it have been dra
matically to shorten the speeches of
both shepherds and Mi'gi. But the
feeling was delightfully preserved
throughout. The highest praise is due
the acting here â so little did it seem
acting, and one i3 grateful for one of
the unforgettable pictures of one's ex
perience. Altogether "The Star of
Bethlehem" is of the thing? that may
not be missed: It comes here the
week after next.

With, her last breath, Laura Camp
bell accused her husband with haying
shot her last Saturday night without
provocation, and expressed hope that
he would be brought to justice. She
v.fls just 22 years of age and to-day
would have been entitled to a rinal de
cree of divorce from the . man Avho
caused her death. The victim died at
the Keoeivinj; Ilospitul at 8:20 oVlock
this morning as the result of a pistol
wound inr.icteil by Lemuel Campbell,
a young butcher.: from whom she sued
for divorce a year ago.. . . -. *
The scer.-j nt the bedside of the youm?
woman was pathetic. Her ased lather
and mother had been summoned and
were heartbroken at (he untimely end
of their only child. District Attorney
Allen was thero_ with Court Reporter
Hugeue Van Court and she told them
that while eh<v was perfotming an act
of kindness in helping/ her husband on
with his^ overcoat he took a pistol out
uf his pocket and shot her. After the
first shot she started to run back into
the house and Jie fired again.. When
ehf got this far in her statement she
fell back. dead. .Shortly afterward
Lemuel, Campbell, who has been, de
tained at the Olty.'.Priaon awaiting tho
outcome of the injuries, was charged
with murder.
The victim of Campbell's brutality
was a pretty blonde. Campbell drank to
such nn extent and abused her so much
that sho was forced to leave him. She
sued for a divorce anil was granted a
decree on November ]6, 1903, and to
day a. final judgment was to have been
made in the ease.
Last Saturday night Campbell went
to the house of Edwin Cutler, 1362
Eleventh street, father of his victim.
As an excuse fcr calling he. took a
dress-suit case .to his wife which she
hud Mot taken from their home. They
talked over some of their differences
in the parlor in the presence of Edwin
Cutler and his wife, and finally Camp
bell becoming somewhat abusive was
ordered to leave the house by Cutler.
He was accompanied to the door by
his wife. wher> he pressed a pistol to
her side and tired.
In a statement made to the police by
the prisoner after his arrest he said
that he wentto the Cutler home in an
swer to a; request for him to come there
from Mrs. Garrmriell. He said that-she
told him she had a pistol and that she
was hot afraid of him, and that he only
fired wh-n he believed she was about
to kill him. His story was flatly con
tradictor"! by his wife. '">'*Â¦

Sny Increase of Minimum Weight in
Carload Lots 'of Canned and Dried
Fruits Is Unfair.
The recent advance by the Western
transportation lines of the minimum
in carload weights for eastbound dried
and canned fruits from 30,000 to 40,
000 pounds has raised a protest
among a number of the California
shippers. They are now circulating
a petition for signatures, asking that
the old weight -be restored on tha
ground that the advance is unfair.
The reason assigned for the advance
is that the railroad companies desire
to relieve the present congested condi
tion and shortage of cars, but the con
tention is openly made by the smaller
shippers that the advance was reaJly
effected for the benefit of a few large
concerns. , It is held by the shippers
that the raising of the minimum
weight seripusly handicaps Eastern
buyers In their purchases, for It
means that they will have to buy
more than they can really handle, es
pecially in small towns," where 30,000
pounds of canned goods, Is about all
the consumption demands.
CALIFORNIA SHIPPERS
OPPOSED TO AN* ADVANCE
. Justice of the Peace Lawson yester
day gave Judgment for $224 'in favor
of Claus Simberg, who sued L. Loss,
a Clay-street saloon-keeper, for dam
ages. .The testimony showed that the
plaintiff asked Loss for a glass of gin
arid the latter, for Â«. practical joke,
gave him amiAonia, which burned
Simberg's mouth and tongue.

Poker Chips Figure in Court.
Justice of the Peace Golden yester
day gave judgment against M. Wein
bcrg. who sued Ben Levy, a barber,
for $25. Levy purchased poker dhips
to that amount in the gambling place
of the California Social Club, of which
Welnberg is manager, at 118 Eddy
street. Levy lost all. the chips in the
game, but failed to produce the money
for the same. Weinberg had to make
Levy's losses good to the other play
ers, but the case was thrown out of
court by Judge Golden because it was
based on a gambling proposition not
recognized by the law.
Drunken Mother's Cruelty.
Mrs. Josephine McMenimen's four
months-old babe was perishing of in
nutrition when the police found it at
her residence, 118% Langton street, and
burried it to a hospital, where its death
is considered almost a certainty. And
as the child starved the mother was
stupidly drunk. When the woman was
arraigned before Judge Mogan she had
nothing to say and to-day she will be
sentenced for cruelty to a minor child.
Her husband is a laborer, and the Hu
mane Society folk say he is a sober and
industrious man.
" Brother Sues Brother.
Edward C. Ellinghouse, as special
administrator of the estate of his
mother Bertha Ellinghouse, who died
February 14, 1903, yesterday,
through his attorney, Samuel Short
ridge, sued his brother, Oscar Elling
house. to set aside the conveyance of
property by the mother to the son
before her death. Two lots in South
San Francisco, $840 cash and twenty
shares of building and loan stock are
involved. Edward contends that his
mother was "weak mentally and was

SACRAMENTO. Nov. 16.â Acting Governor
Alden Anderson to-day designated Superior
Judge J. M Sea well of San Francisco to sit

& Lux against the A. Brown Company.
her lips. The touch sent a chill to her
heart. It was as of Ice. Frantically
she hurried into a drugstore at Seventh
s.nd Folsom streets and begged the
clerk to do something for the little one.
He told her that he could not help her.
The terrified mother finally reached
the home of her sister, Mrs. Salvatori,
at 1155 Folsom street, where she stag
gered Into the house crying, "Baby is
sick." Mrs. Salvatori took the little
bundle of humanity into her arms.
"Why. the child is dead!" she cried-
The mother had been for several hours
holding a dead baby to. her breast.
The little one was taken to the
Morgue, where it was determined that
death resulted from exposure. The
mother was arrested and placed on the
detinue book, pending the result of a
Coroner's inquest. Detective Coleman,
who was detailed on the case, shortly
afterward arrested the father, George
Ayer. Investigations made by the de
tective show that both parents were
addicted to the use of liquor. The
father was sleeping in a stable while
his wife was walking the streets with
the dead baby in her arms.
Mrs. Hicks, the landlady of the lodg
ing-house at ZZV.i Sixth street, says
that Mrs. Ayer was not forced out, but
became abusive and left.
While Mrs. Anastasia Ayer wandered
airr.lessly about the streets Tuesday
right and yesterday morning her four
monthg-uld boy baby died in her arms.
Mother and child, it is claimed, had
been ejected from their lodgings at
3"1Â»4 Sixth street for non-payment of
rent. The landlady, Mrs. Hicks, claims
that at the time of the eviction Mrs.
Ayer was under the influence of liquor.
With her infant in her arms the
mother started out upon the streets.
The little fellow was laughing and coo
ing cheerfully in the pleasant sunlight.
Ae night drew near the baby began to
grow restless, but the mother tried to
soothe him She walked aimlessly
about, not knowing where to go. She
could not return to her lodgings," for
the furniture had been thrown from her
room and the place was locked. She
did not know where to find her hus
band, George Ayer. She had not seen
him for several days.
Gay crowds passed and repassed the
Â¦uistful young mother. The cold night
air chilled the little one's tender flesh
and 5t awakened crying pitifully. She
sat down in a doorway, but as passers
by noticed her she clutched the infant
ck>ser lo her breast and resumed her
weary tramp. .
Bewildered and hungry, the woman

baby, walled fretfully. Mrs. Ayer took

Masons to Celebrate an Anniversary.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 16. â The Ma
sonic Veteran "Association of the Pa
cific Coast has decided to hold its
twenty-seventh annual session in
Portland during the Lewis and Clark
Exposition. The date set for the meet
ing Is September 11. which is the date
the first Masonic lodge on the Pacific
Coast was organized at Oregon City
In 1848. It is expected that there will
be a large attendance of Masons from
all -over the Pacific Coast to join in
celebrating the important anniversary.
Four -able-bodied men experienced
such difficulty in r/talning their seats
upon the prostrate figure of Samuel
Mercer, carpenter, that they cordially
welcomed the aid assured them by the
arrival of Patrolman McHugh. Even
then Mr. Mercer's complete subjugation
was not accomplished without strenu
ous effort by the quintet.
The struggle occurred upon the side
walk fronting the Mercer residence, 85
California avenue, Bernal Heights, and
Its cause was Mr! Mercer's endeavor to
fulfill a threat to slay his wife. The
woman's screams attracted neighbors,
and the 'four able-bodied men herein
before alluded to cast themselves upon
the would-be assassin and succeeded in
bearing him to earth, but their ability
to hold him down was problematical
when the bluecoated reinforcement ap
peared. Of rather slender build, the
man was a marvel of muscular
strength. One of the conquerors lik
ened him unto "a bundle of steel
springs."
When the case was called before
Judge Mogan the policeman testified
that in the defendant's dwelling he
found six fully-loaded shooting irons,
and the wife averred that he had In
tended to use the weapons in his work
of extermination. This the defendant
denied, claiming that he kept the
armory merely on acount of its value
from the viewpoint of an antiquarian.
An ancient-appearing shotgun, with
flint and steel attachment, was most
highly prized by him, he said, because
it had directly descended from his
great-grandfather, who riddled many a
Tory soldier with Its contents during
the revolutionary war. A more mod
ern rifle of Winchester pattern was also
coddled because it was the sole
relic of an indulgent father's once-vast
estate. An old-fashioned Smith & Wes
son revolver was new when the defend
ant was a boy, and It had been treas
ured by him ever since. Another pistol,
although neither an heirloom nor a
souvenir of a happy childhood, was
among his cherished possessions be
cause it reminded him that feminine
honesty is not a myth. Inasmuch as it
had been given by an impecunious lady
for whom he had paid a milk bill. His
possession of the two remaining pistols
could not logically be accounted for on
either sentimental or practical grounds,
as they looked ugly and were of cheap
manufacture.
Case continued till to-morrow.
A race war that originated in. Pinck
ney dace has slopped over into Hinck
ley alley, and police reports are to the
effect that it threatens to spread to
other points of the Barbary Coast. The
belligerents are Mexicans and Porto
Ricans, and. the casualties thus far re
corded are:
Marie Pinto, Porto Ricanâ Right in
dex finger almost amputated by teeth
of Juana Besang, Mexican.
Theo Bustamento, Porto Ricanâ
Nether lip perforated by. knife wielded
by Lorenzo Andrino, Mexican.
Justina Rodriguez, Porto Ricanâ Left
hand severely cut by knife in hand of
Manuel Alvarez, Mexican.
In each of the above cases an arrest
was made, but several cutters and
slashers are at large and pursued by
the police. It is significant that the
three injured ones are Porto Ricans. An
invasion of Plnckney place by natives
of Uncle Sam's new possessions in the
Atlantic and a threatening ousting of
the Mexicans therefrom was the basic
cause of a fray that has grown to such
alarming proportions that sanguinary
skirmishes are of almost daily occur
rence. The Mexicans taunt the Porto
Ricans with having relinquished their
national independence, and the Porto
Ricans retort by expressing pride in
their new allegiance and contemptu
ously alluding to the Mexicans as "'alien
peons." As every male Porto Rican
and Mexican carries a knife fashioned
and intended for stabbing, and as every
woman of either race is prone to use
her teeth when engaged In warfare, the
outlook for surgical and police work Is
encouraging.

Edward T. Wheatley, charged with
hating stolen $325 from Mrs. Elsie Hll
flsch whfcle serving as her bartender
at 249 Ste'venson street, was sent to the
Superior Court, with ball fixed at $1000,
by Judge Cabaniss.
Miss Dollie Martin, whose debut as a
danseuse on Pacific street was quickly
followed by her first appearance as a
defendant In the Police Court, giggled
nervously when Judge Fritz remarked
that her second arrest for drunkenness
would result in her incarceration for
at least thirty days.
"I really can't help laughing, Judge,"
she chuckled, "although it means no
disrespect, to you. I drank absinthe
last night and It has kept me laugh
ing ever since. No more of it in mine,
you can bet yours." vv/, .
And she fairly jeljled with merriment
as Bhe walked away.
Half a dozen putative dentistsâ H.
E. Bock, Robert Dunn, J. C. Perry, C.
H. Whitely, A. J. Brackenrldge and M.
H. Shord â were accused of practicing
without licenses and each of them de
manded a separate jury trial. Judge
Cabaniss took the applications under
advisement.
Mary Fagan, a former school teacher.
who was accused of disturbing, the
peace of the Hotel' Annapolis, at Bush
and Stockton streets, last Tuesday
evening, whlled away, her time In Judge
Mogan's court by ... reading "Weavers
and Weft," by Miss M. E. Braddon, and
so interested did she. become in the tale
that her name was 'thrice called ere
she responded. Then she turned down
a leaf corner and handed I the volume
to 'Bailiff Hickey with a request that
he hold it If or. her. â -
.It was to visit her sister,' housekeeper
at the Annapolis, that she went to that
hostelry, she told the Judge, and If she
accosted perfect strangers with demand
for monetary loans and abused those
who declined to contribute she had no
recollection of doing so. Had she been
drinking? Well, she admired the im
pudence of any one who dared ask her
such a question as that.
After the Judge had pronounced her
guilty she returned to the mourners'
bench, resumed perusal of "Weavers
and Weft" and smiled and sighed with
the heroine thereof until the Hickey
finger wagged her Jallward.
Adolf Cassasso, accused of fast driv
ing at Fourth and Market streets,
asked Judge Fritz if he had ever seen
an ice wagon exceed the regulation
speed limit. When the Judge, after due
reflection, answered in the negative
and added that he had always regard
ed an ice wagon jj as a synonym for
vehicular slowness.'Signor Cassasso de
clared that at the time of his arrest
an ice wagon was directly ahead of his
horse. His Honor glanced reprovingly
at the complaining policeman and was
evidently on the verge of dismissing
the case when the Prosecuting Attor
ney suddenly whispered to the officer
and then as suddenly asked the de
fendant:
"The wagon ahead of youâ was it
laden with ice or was it merely a niceâ
n-i-c-e, nice â wagon?"
Then came the disclosure that the
vehicle in question was owned ,by a
furniture-moving firm and that its gor
geously decorated exterior led Mr. Cas
sasso to describe it as a nice wagon.
Prosecution triumphant. Sentence to
day.
"And it Is such an old pun," sighed
his Honor.
Mrs. Grace Squires, defendant on
half a dozen distinct charges of theft,
calmly sat in Judge Cabaniss' court
and heard Mrs. Verlie Campbell of
123 Turk street and Peter Hoy of
1105 Laguna street testify against her.
She was caught in the act of rummag
ing Mrs. Campbell's trunk "during that
lady's absence from her apartment,
and in her purse were found a dia
mond ring, a marquise ring, a dia
mond stickpin and a golden horse
shoe set with pearls, all of which
were identified by: Mr. Hoy as prop
erty stolen from his residence. The
defendant's attorney- asked for time
to make ud his mind as to whether
he will offer at the preliminary hear
ing a defense or allow the cases to
go to the Superior Court, and the
Judge granted a continuance till this
morning.
Sidney Danby, accused of felony
embezzlement, was remanded to the
Superior Court by Judge Mogan, with
bail set at $500. John Morris, presi
dent of the Danby Company, Lim
ited, alleged that while acting as
cashier of that corporation the de
fendant received x and failed to ac
count for a salary warrant for $76
deposited by John Donaldson, a pos
tal clerk.
Judge Mogan issued a, warrant
charging Charles Boyd, keeper of an
inn on the. San Bruno road, with ex
tortion. Boyd had two boys, J. F.
Beneke and Willie Sage, arrested and
accused of driving away a horse and
cart which were found about two
blocks from where he had' left them,
but the lads claimed that the horse
was wandering when they met and
stopped him, and as no regular com
plaint -had been filed the case was
dismissed. Then it came to the ears
of the Judge that Boyd had obtained
a $50 ball receipt and $30 cash from
Beneke by threatening to prosecute
him for horse stealing, and when
taxed with the' act Boyd confessed it,
but claimed that the S80 was due him
for damages sustained by his -horse
and cart at the hands of Beneke and
Sage. After Investigating that claim
the Judge pronounced it unjust, in
structing his clerk to refuse payment
on the ball receipt and also advised
Boyd to refund the $30 'cash he had
taken from the boy. Boyd declined
to do so and the extortion charge was
entered. It will he heard to-day.
Emanuel SImoni, peddler of plaster
of paris statuettes, opined that he
could not be compelled to pay license

Twenty Porto Rlcans who spent an

In Judge Graham's court yesterday
morning at the beginning of the trial
of their suit to recover wages. The
original suit was in behalf of thirty of
the laborers, but nineteen of them are
said to be satisfied with the payment
made by Fook Soo, the Chinese labor
contractor who hired them. A. B.
Treadwell i3 prosecuting the claims of
the ethers and, judging from
yesterday's proceedings, a compromise
is in prospect.
The hearing did not progress very
far.. After two witnesses had been ex
amined it was discovered that the
pleadings, were defective . and Judge
Treadwell asked for time to amend.
Judge Graham suggested that in the
meantime the matter should be settled
out of court, but declared that he would
do everything in his power to see that
the men got their pay t
The Chinese contractor and his fore
man, Soo Yen; were represented by L.
G. Carpenter and the Naknek Com
pany by W.' H. Hutton and Max Kuhl.
The company contends that it is ex
onerated from any liability on the la
bor contracts because It paid the
Chinaman a lump sum for the men
supplied. This Is the usual practice of
the canning companies. They arrange
to pack so many cases of salmon each
Beason and engage" their laborers In
bulk, paying the Chinese contractors all
the way from $10,000 to $50,000 a season.
In the case of Fook Soo, says Mr. Car
penter, SOO or 400 Chinese and Japanese
laborers have been paid and nineteen of
the Porto Ricans. The others have
been offered $550 for the eleven, but
want more. Treadwell asked yesterday
if the offer would be renewed, but Car
penter paid he would have to see hla
client first.
Mr. Carpenter declared informally In
court that Soo Yen, the foreman, had
been assaulted in this city by one of
the Porto Ricans and that threats had
been made against the life of Fook Soo.
He declared that the men were a bad
lot, and in Alaska would buy Chinese
gin, get drunk and refuse to work. For
this there was a penalty of 50 cents an
hour, and besides, the men are said to
have bought supplies which used up a
portion of their wages due.
Luis Yturbe, the first, witness, was
one of the employes and he said that
the Chinamen beat him cruelly, and
nearly killed him. They also placed
him in an oven. Ramon Vllanero, the
other witness, was foreman of the Porto
Ricans and responsible for their en
gagement. He' said that he met Fook
Soo on the street and was taken to the
office of L. A. Peterson, where he was
told that he would be paid {5 a head
for all the "Castllians" he could get.- He
engaged thirty-six men at $110 each,
signing the contracts himself, as in
structed bv the Chinamen. He said he
was told that Peterson would be re
sponsible for the pay. He only received
$30 on his commissions and says he
lias been paid nothing for his services
as foreman in the north.

SORRY SHE SPOKE.
The record is such as to make us fear that woman suffrage,
instead of taming and gentling politics, has overcome the calm
manners of the gentler sex, and that our sister woman has no more
scruples in out-tricking the opposition than we have. Women arc
by no means contented in the suffrage States to vote or scratch
tickets nominated for them by men. They go to the primaries and
do more than their share of persuading results in the conventions.
One thing is noticeable : they are not inclined to plump for ladies
who are candidates for office* but quarrel over men.
In Wyoming women voted when it was a Territory and there
fore had the power to perpetuate their right in the State constitution.
They do not as generally seek office there as they do in Colorado,
Utah and Idaho, but they are in the show for all that. The latest
news from Wyoming tells us of a duel between two ladies living on
ranches near Fort Bridger. They had fought in the road several
times and finally issued to each othec a warning that the next com
bat would be a gun fight. It was. They met armed with revolvers
and fought and fired until both fell and one was killed. The sur
vivor, with several serious wouirds, is in jail, putting up the old
masculine plea of self-defense.
It is a far cry^from a knitting needle to a revolver, from a
broomstick to a gun in the hands of lovely woman, and we are not
prepared to say that society will be the gainer from the change of
instruments and occupations. When the woman militant masters
the manual of arms the tyrant man would better surrender his latch
Uvy and vacate his seat on the mackerel kit at the corner grocery,
lest he get an indigestible dose of cold lead. We measure the dis
tance to the cellar while we ask, in anxiety of mind and fear of
personal danger, whether woman suffrage has advanced public virtue
and morality and whether women have refined politics or politics
has coarsened women. We are prepared to dodge missiles and await
the answer, but not calmly. I
WE desire to call the attention of Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw
and Mrs. Catt to the doings of the new woman in the States
where the ladies are in all political respects our fellow-citi
zens and vote and fight. The only warm State on election day was
Colorado, where the ladies did their' share of red hot work at the
polls and were as ready to fight as to vote.

Not until the .very mor.ning of the
day set for the. important function did
the expected box arrive. , Hortense

They had doubtless bought this at the
same time. But, although she had
read in grateful amazement the sum
mentioned' on the receipted bill that
had been forwarded tbher by mail, it
was with a heart prophetically filled
with d(?ubt that Lesda opened' the
box, while; her aunt looked over. her

Bruce Ferguson, with' a man's obtuse
ness, did not realize what the inevitable
change in their manner of living must
mean to such fastidious women as his

an income on Lucinda, but Lesda de
clared that her music teaching would
bring her In all the money she would
require- Of the deprivations and make-
Bhifts necessary to present a serene
front to a critical world neither spoke.
"So you'll surely come," Ferguson
went on breezily. "I'm going to do
the thing In fine styleâ have music and
caterers down from Chicago, and all
that sort of thing."
The expression of proud reserve
deepened on the countenance of Lesda
Revere. She had an odd, exquisite
style of beauty, foreign to her class
and nationality. While her features
were not classically perfect, there was
about her face a look of spirituality,
of distinction, that attracted and held
attention.
"I hope you'll have a beautiful time,"
the said courteously. "But I shan't
go. Uncle Bruce."
He stared at her a moment in puzzled
surprise. Then he laughed heartily and
brought his clenched flat down in the
palm Vjf the other hand.
"Nothing to wear, I'll bet a nickel!
Poor Miss Flora McFlimsey!" For he
saw by her quick, irrepressible smile
that he had guessed aright. "Well,
you will have a dress, and one sent to
you ready made from the city at that!
Why, Hortense won't wear a thing
that's made in Lindenville! Now, you'll
promise to come? Well, what is it?"
She had been about to speakâ to ask
him to permit hereto choose the gown
herself. But, after all, what right had
she to make suggestions to him? Was
he not exceedingly generous to prom
ise her a costume at' all?

Visitorâ Yes, Indeed; but yon k&orv
I can never tell which- way either oi

"So I've heard, Uncle Bruce."
The tone was nonchalant, but she
had colored rosily up to the crisp,
reddish-gold curls around her white
forehead.
"It will be a great thing for Linden
ville if he decides to settle down here.
I hope," with ponderous archness,
"that you will try to persuade him!" â¢
The flush faded, leaving her looking
paleâ and very proud, y
"I shall have nothing to say in the
matter," she answered coldly. . "It is
unlikely that I shall even meet him.*^
"Nonsense!" Ferguson cried,- drop

will! We'll all have a chance to re

welcoming dance for him. Hortense

added leniently, "and we like to in
dulge her."
Lesda nodded, evincing polite In
terest. Until the mother of Hortense
had married her uncle twelve months
previous she and her aunt had lived
with Bruce Ferguson, directing his
household. - But with the coming of a
bride possessed of a grown daughter
all this was changed. So Lucinda Fer
guson, having got , together 'her few
heirlooms and some furniture, had
moved, into a little house she owned

The new mistress and her daughter
were left in victorious possession; and
Ferguson, the town banker, portly
and prosperous, striding down the
main street one delicious summer
morning, met his niece on her way to
give a music lesson, and stopped to
tease her a trifle over the situation.

It is with gentle touch that autumn I

music from their melodious strings, j
Here is the song of autumnal love, as i
it comes to me in imperfect prose: \
It was cool and quiet in the wood, |
and this young girl wandered there ;
when her heart was heavy, treading
softly lest she disturb the hush that â¢
lay there sleeping. She would close her
eyes, and think that she felt the !
shadows on her face; they touched her 1
eyelids lightly, like fairy fingers, and j
pleasant fancies came and went un- !
ceasingly. |
As the unseen world opened more ;
widely before her vision, her heart grew ;
lighter, and the trouble that had lain .
on her spirit lifted, Just as the morn
ing mist rises before the early sun. j
Then sounds broke in upon her I
dreaming, the thud of acorns on the :
wet, black earth, the birds fluttering in
the branches overhead, the tap-tap of
the hungry woodpecker, the red leaves
lapping dellciously. It was all sweet
and strange, and never to be forgotten; !
and when she turned homeward, the j
young girl cast back a lingering glance
that had beneath its tenderness an ex- '
ultation, like that which one wears who
has surprised another's happy secret.
She did not know that the secret she
had learned was that of her own soul. I
In thlB manner come the children of
earth to the great All-Mother, to sit at
her knee for a lesson in love. With
gentle persuasions of touch, and sight, j
and sound, she leads them in her ways

Her Woodlands, are a very temple of;
the heart's religion; in the stillness and ,
awe of them the spirit of maid or man '
is lifted, and the soul expands to a new I
consciousness of love. The stars of
heaven, the flowers of the soil, the wind
blowing softly over evening meadows,
the sun ending daylight with a burst
of gloryâ these are her text-books and
her words of wiadom. j
The lady-moon, that pale-faced con- ;
fidante of love, had been identified, by ,
a scientist who is a poet at heart, with
the same' sentiments of love, depend
ence, and reverence on the part of ,
youth which infancy feels toward the
mother's face. j

By Dorothy F^nimore
The City Council of Oakland so considered the matter when Mr.
Fitzgerald, a competent expert and disinterested engineer, was em
ployed to report upon the plan which is now renewed by the citizens'
committee. His report was that the Bay Cities Company could com
mand only 12,000,000 gallons per day, instead of the 20,000.000 now
reported by the committee, and that the quality of the water was
undesirable. The renewed offer obviates neither of these objections.
Since Fitzgerald's and the other reports were made, the land owners
in the Santa Clara Valley have begun litigation to prevent the re
moval of this water from the county, and have secured injunctions
to that end. The Spring Valley also has claims on the same water
supply and has begun suit to protect them. Under such circum
stances it seems a risky thing to burden the city's credit so / largely
in a project so doubtful and so much incumbered by litigation.
As an alternative plan the committee submits the taking of
ground water from' the Niles cone. The engineers' report on that
supply puts it at 14,000,000 gallons. Of this the Contra Costa Com
pany already owns 5.000.000 and the beet sugar mill 3,000,000, while
the Spring Valley Company claims much more, and private land
owners have a share. It will be seen then that this supply is liti
gable also, and subject to be tied up by injunction. In view of all
this, is it not possible that the plans of the citizens' committee do
not fit the case?
In the report made by Mr. Howard for the City Council, a prin
ciple was laid down that cannot be got away from. It is recognized
in every European city that is in municipal trading. It is, that no
city should embark in municipal ownership in competition with a
private plant already in the field. This was recognized in the city
of Cleveland, where the voters refused to embark in municipal
electric light and power in competition with a private plant. The
claim made in Oakland for cheaper water rates is based upon the
statement that the Contra Costa plant is overvalued, that its water
is watered, in fact. Now, if this is true and the real value of the
plant is what the Council has declared it to be, is it not plain that
it can compete successfully with a municipal plant costing fully
$6,000,000. and most likely more? When the economy in adminis
tering a private plant is pitted against the extravagance and waste
that are inevitable in municipal administration, the extreme unwis
dom of leaving the private plant in the field should be apparent.
The Oakland situation is of great interest, far outside the field
in which it lies. It presents every feature that can arise in embark
ing upon the policy of municipal ownership. It involves the ex
haustion of the public credit, or putting the cost upon the plant
itself. It involves quantity and quality of supply, and most intricate
litigation between different claimants, and the competition of a pri
vate r^lant condemned only for basing its rates upon an overvaluation,
which, if true, means that it can stay in the field. In view of the
complexity of the problem, if the existing plant refused to sell or
lease, it is apparent that before the decision is made the city will
have to enlarge its plans and go further to secure a greater scheme
that is free from the intricate entanglements that are upon the ono
now proposed. Let it be remembered, too, that the larger the plan
the better its ability to carry its own bonds and pay its own cost.
THE water question is again under discussion in Oakland. A
committee of citizens has made two propositions, upon which
advice is sought from the people. One is to pay the Bay Cities
Water Company to bring a supply to the city line, the price being
$3,750,000, the city to construct a distributing system, which the
committee believe "will cost riot less than $2,000,000, making the total
cost and bond issue $5,750,000, for which the whole city is to be
bonded to the exhaustion of its credit to that amount.
The position of The Call upon municipal ownership of public
utilities is well known. We believe that all plants so owned should
exclusively bear the credit used in their acquisition, leaving the mu
nicipal credit unencumbered. In other words, doing just as will be
done in the extension of the San Francisco seawall, which will
alone carry the $2,000,000 in bonds issued for its construction and
pay them out of its revenues, leaving the taxpayers of the city and
State* free of incumbrance on that account. If this C3n be done
with the seawall, why not with the Oakland water plant?
The wisest proponents of municipal trading in this country how
accept this as the sole guarantee of wisdom and economy in the
municipal management of a. utility plant. With such object lessons
as the new ferry depot and the seawall extension before our people,
those in the large cities of California who favor municipal owner
ship of utilities should not go astray. Above all things, this mat
ter should be discussed as a business proposition, in which prejudice
and recrimination have no proper part.

The red room of the Bohemian Club
was the scene of a dinner given last
evening by Mr. end Mrs. Harry H.
Haijrht.
VERY one in town knew that
E Gordon Ellis had made a for
tune in the Klondike and was
coming back to his native town-
And the general supposition ex
isted that he was returning in
quest of a wife. There wer-e those who,
recalling the boy and girl love affair
between him and Lesda Revere, smiled
significantly. But there were others
who averred that both had been too
young and inexperienced at the time
"Come for your uncle's sake!" he
begged. "Every one here in Linden
ville knows you. It will be srreat fun!
And then, Lessie, come for my sake!"
It was great fun. The verdict that
the girl in the sea-green gown, with
cheeks like wild roses, was the belle
of the ball was practically unanimous.
Only- Ilqmense and her mother ex
changed a glance of dark and signifi
cant disappointment when Bruce Fer
guson, smiling indulgently if obtusely,
whispered:- "Coohetua up to date!
Not such a bad match for a little
music teacher."
.."Isn't that the â the right thing?
It's Just stunning. You look like an
Undine â a silver-birch incarnated!
All pale green and white â except for
a crown of gold '."And this audacious
young man stoopel to touch the shin
ing coronet with reverent lips.
' "Lessie, you must know why I've
come back!" His voice dropped to a
coaxing cadence. "I've come â for
you! Dear, have I startled you?
Well, come up. to the dance, and I'll
promise to be dumb until â the last
waltz."
"In a dress that cost a quarter a
yard â and that I made myself?" ahe
queried, her voice tremulous with ex
citement.
"But I can't, Gordon!" She was
blushing like a rose. "Not in this
old 20\vn!"
He glanced over her criticallyâ in
bewilderment.
She was very resolute in reading the
tiny volume of Tennyson she had
brought when after supper she came
out into the fragrant solitude. Her
gown was of simple lawri, that trailed
about her feet in a sweep as of broken
waves. Her arms shone pearl fair
through its transparency.
The afterglow faded. Shadows
crept stealthily up the garden ways.
It was not possible to read longer.
Anyhow,' she had hardly been aware
cf that which she was readVng. . Now
the guests were gathering at her
uncle's Imposing home. Lights were
blazing and the gay music from the
city resounding. And now. She
closed her eyes, drifting away into a
reverie, vari-hued, melodious, kaleido
scopic, so absorbing that she did "riot
notice the stopping of a carriage at
the gate nor the heavy footstep muf
fled by the thick grass.
"I wonder if a kiss would waken
lu-r!" meditated a quizzical- voice.
"I'm not " She started to her
feet, the. flooding light of the warm,
young midsummer moon full on her
face. "Gordon!" she murmured.
Older, heavier, manlier than the
young fellow wiÂ»o had. gone away,
there was still the admiration in his
eager eves â the smile of tenderness
about the. square-cut lips.
"You're a nice sirl!" he cried, hold
ing her cold, slight hands in his warm,
heavy pressure, Never to come to a
party given in the honor of your, old
friend! I looked for you everywhere.
Your uncle said you had promised
him vou would come. So he sent me
to bring'you. Or rather," he laughed,
"1 asked him if I might not come for
you. Comeâ Lessie!"
It was the old childish name that
no one else had called her.
The long, hot golden days lagged
by. Never had the giving of music
lessons seemed so tedious, nor had the
pupils ever appeared so tiresome.
Coming hctaxe just as the relentless
sun was dropping down the west, the
girl brightened with wan pleasure at
the sight of the little old gray cottage
she "called home. In the house she
knew would be balm â the bairn of
s.\mpathy, or rest, of love."
"I'll have a bath and a fresh gown,"
she told herself, "and get out here in
the silence and the sweetness and read
until I forget there are gay people
dancing the night away â and I not
cne of them!"
Not for worlds would she have ad
mitted even to her own. heart that it
was less the social exhilaration she
missed than the wee, hidden hope she
had harbored of seeing once more a
well remembered dark head, of feeling
the warm clasp of a strong, firm hand,
and of meeting the half tender, half
quizzical glance of expressive blue
eyes.
back with a little cry of dismay as
the gleaming, lustrous, costly fabric
was revealed
"What have I done to make Uncle
Bruce's wife and daughter dislike me
so?" she whispered. "They kr^ewâ
you know," Aunt Lucindaâ that I can
never wear such a shade!"
Lucinda Ferguson shook her head.
Tears of disappointment came into her
gentle old eyes as she grazed down on
the expensive robe. It was of raw,
crude, brickish pink â the very last
hue that a girl with hair the copper
color of Lesda's dare wear.
The girl laid back the layers of tis
sue paper, with fingers that trembled.
"I'm sorry, because Uncle "Bruce
meant so well. And then," with lips
that would quiver, "I get a chance to
go to> a dance so seldom!"

BOSTON, Nov. 16.â Believing that an
injustice had been done Private John
F. Smith, whose dis^arge from the
United States army was recommended
by General Grant because he married
a negress, the colored people of New
England have sent a petition to- Presi
dent Roosevelt, asking that he inter
vene. Some time ago the New England
Suffrage League sent cut blanks ask
ing' for signatures to the petition on
the ground that the discharge of white
soldiers from t,he army for no other
reason than that they had married col
ored women wc-uld encourage the pre
judice against negroes, in the army and
out, and that it would be an insult to
every colored woman. The petition,
which was headed by C. C. Morgan,
Boston lawyer, and signed by nearly
1000 persons, was as follows:.
We. the undersigned colored Americans, be
lieving that interests of personal liberty
require that the appeal of Private John F.
Smith, stationed at Fort Worth. Salem. N. J..
from his discharge by his 6iiperlor officers,
resulting from his marriage to a woman of
our race, be sustained, and realizing: that his
discharge, except for specific wrongdoing,
would, under the circumstances operate with
great injury to colored Americans, hereby pray
and petition you. Theodore Roosevelt, Presi
dent of thÂ« United States, head of the army,
to Intervene to the end that tho discharge of
Smith may be rescinded. f
LOS ANGEL.ES, Nov. 16.â A special
to the Express from Whittier, Cal.,
says: A
Reports from Merced that County
Auditor Cook alleges that irregular
claims have been presented to Merced
County by Superintendent Smith of
the Whittier Reform School in connec
tion with the release of the boys Rob
ert and Dick Shaw, August 15, seem to
have been based on a misunderstand
ing of â¢ the methods pursued by the
board of trustees, which methods have
the approval of Governor Pardee.
According to the allegations of Aud
itor Cook of Merced the State school
officials were guilty of misrepresenta
tion in filing the claims for the support
of the Shaw boys for August, Septem
ber and October, affidavits obtained
from the boys- stating that they left
the school August 15.
Since the State school of correction
was established at Whittier, the
amount advanced by the county to the
State, $11 a month for each pupil, has
been claimed until the pupil was dis
charged or paroled. Superintendent
Smith said to-day that this plan had
been in vogue during his adminstra
tion and heretofore no question had
been raised by county officials in re
gard to it.
"About three-' months ago," he con
tinued, -"I sent these boys to their
home in Fresno on furlough, and at a
meeting of the trustees a month ajÂ£b I
recommended their discharge from the
school. They wore discharged, but for
the intervol between the furlough and
their dismissal from the school charges
for their keeping; was rendered. This
is the practice of the school and it is
followed every month in similar cases.
Immediately upon the discharge or
parole of a cadet the charge against
the county from which he comes for his
maintenance is stopped. Our plan has
been approved by the Governor, th<;
State Board of Examiners and the
board of trustees, and in fact, is the
only one practicable."
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 16. â A pitiful
story of hunger and destitution and a
pathetic tale of patience and faith in
the ultimate consideration of a kind
Government are brought from the
eastern mountains of this county by
men who have been Investigating the
condition of the Indians on the Gov
ernment reservations near Campo. In
dian Agent Charles E. Schell ot Pala
and Charles F. Lummls, the well
known author and editor of "Out
"West," have spent Â«lx days among the
red men. The gist of what they found
la harrowing enough to send a shud
der throcgh tha country.
In the five reservations near Campo,
on the edge of the desert, there are at
present nearly 200 Indians â not the
dirty, vicious, untutored, begging
creatures who Infest the transcon
tinental railroad sations, but hard
â¢working, Intelligent farming people,
who cultivate every possible square
inch of the practically worthless, land
reserved for them by the nation. No
rain has fallen to start the seed plant
ed, no water is at hand for Irrigating,
no large reserve food supply is ever
possible and the unfortunates are now
subsisting chiefly upon acorns.
"Unless relief comes," said Lummls,
"all the Indians will be dead before
New Tear's day. Such emaciation,
such patient suffering among old and
young alike, I have never seen before
and never want to see again. Those
Indians loathe putrid flesh, yet such
Is their extremity that when fcney see
vultures devouring any animal that
has been killed they scare the birds
away and eke out their larder with
the flesh. They also go out and catch
rats and mice and eat them."

Most of the great problems of organization
and methods have now been solved, and prog
ress in construction and settlement is being
made with Increasing rapidity. The passage
of the reclamation law was a great step to
ward realizing the beet use Is to produce water
for Irrigation. But, always and in every
place, the best uso of public lands is their uao
by the man who has come to stay. There are
unfortunately In every part of our country a
few men whose interests arc purely temporary,
who are eager to skim the cream and go, to the
detriment of tho natural reservoir upon which
national Irrigation depends to the permanent
loss of every agency which makes for the true
development and lasting greatness of the Ir
rigable States. Such interests cannot be al
lowed to control.
ALI, INTERESTS JOINED.
The following letter from President
Roosevelt was read and aroused much
enthusiasm:
WASHINGTON. D. C, Nov. 10, 1901.
To the National Irrigation Congress: It Is
a pleasurr to send my greeting to you. both
as President oT tho United States and as a
man who has lived in the West and Is eager
for its prosperity. Whatever any man or body
of men may believe as to any question m
political controversy, we may unite in the
great duty of international Improvement: me
duty or making every foot of soil, .every
stream and every other resource of natural
or human origin contribute to th* very ut
mcBt to the permanent prosperity of our coun
try. I consratulate you because you are no
lenerer striving for what unct? Â»eÂ«nud * dis
tant hope; you are no longer engaged In a
campaign of education for the passage of a
reclamation act. On the contrary, your nret
great object is achieved. You have yet to
consider what has been done and what Is
being done under that act by the reclamation
service, to consider means to give it lta
largest and widest results and to discuss tnÂ«
broad problems of Irrigation methoda and
It was through your efforts and men llUe you
that the people of the I'nited States, as a na
tion undertook to attack the desert and to do
away with It. net only so far aÂ« therÂ« Is
water now for that purpose, but to the fullest
exten/ for which water may be developed
hÂ«rearter. Such an attack can be successful
only when bated on accurate knowledge. W hen
tht reclamation act was passed the essential
facts as to strÂ«am flow had been ascertained
In many parts of the United States, and the
scientific basis for a national reclamation,
which otherwise would have taken years to
accumulate, was already In a large part at
hand. The fact that so much progress has
already been made in the reclamation fervlce
Is a striking example of the advantage of sci
entlflc Investigation by the general Govern
ment. It may be true that, to the man
whose Interest is limited- by immediate re
sults, the admirable {.work of the reclamation
service at time* seems slow, but we are
building for a great future, and It In far
more important that tho works built should
tw permanent and succes.-rful than that they
should bÂ« completed in haste. There will be
no unwise hurry: neither will there be any
unnecessary delay.
Among the resolutions Introduced and
referred was one asking that congress
include Texas in the list of States that
may benefit from the national funds;
one urging legislation appropriating
funds for the creation of additional
forest reserves and another repeating
and emphasizing the resolutions of pre
vious congresses in favor of consolidat
ing all Government forestry work in
the Department of Agriculture.

"My customers, naturally, have been
interested and I am compelled to an-
swer a great many questions about
Grape-Nuts.
"Some people would think that a pfm-
ple dish of Grape-Nuts and cream
would not carry one through to the
noonday meal, but It .will and in the
most vigorous fashion."

When the doctor takes his own medi-
cine and the grocer eats the food he
recommends some confidence comes to
the observer.
A grocer of Ossian, Ind., had a prac-
tical experience with food worth any
one's attention.
He says: 'Six years aeo I became so
weak from stomach and bowel trouble
that I was finally compelled to give up
all work in my store, and in fact all
Borts of work, for abouy, four years.
The last year I was confined to the bed
nearly all of the time and much of
the time unable to retain food of any
Â¦ort on my stomach. My bowels were
badly constipated continually and I lost
in weight from 165 pounds down to
eighty-eight pounds-
"When at the bottom of the ladder I
changed treatment entirely and started
in on Grape-Nuts and cream for nour-
ishment. I used absolutely nothing but
this for about three months. I slowly
improved until I got out of bed and
began to move about.
"I have been improving regularly
and now in the past two years have
been working about fifteen hours a day
in the store and never felt better in
my life.
â¢â¢During- these two years I have never
missed a breakfast of Grape-Nuts and
cream, and often have it two meals a
clay, but the enlire breakfast is always
made of Grape-Nuta and cream alone.
"Since commencing the use of Grape-
ICuts I have nei-er used anything to
stimulate the action of the bowels* a
thing I had to do for years, but this
food keeps me regular and in fine shape
and I am gTowing stronger and heavier
every day.

they believe Kerr attempted to commit
suicide, (and,, failing, concocted the
story of being fired at. C. H. Miller, a
watchman, saw Kerr walk alone -to the
end of , the wharf, saw him sit down,
light two matches and then Millar
heard a shot. He also heard Kerr
shouting for help and threw a .rope". to
him while -he was clinging to .one of
the piles. .

The football game between the elev
ens from, the Crocker and the Clement
Grammar schools resulted in an eaay
victory for the former yesterday aft
ernoon at the Presidio Athletic grounds.
Crocker made three touchdowns in the
first half and two In the second, while
Clement scored but once during the
game. Crocker failed at all five trials
at goal while Clement \ easily kicked
goal. The score was 25 to 6 in favor of
Crocker.
In the first half the Crocker boys
had things all their own way and
scored almost at will. Tobln, Crock
er's heavy left halfback, scored
two- touchdowns in the . first half
and one in the second. Solomon scored
the remaining points for Crocker.
In the second half Clement . played
better football and their opponents had
a much harder time gaining their
yards. After Crocker had scored once
in the second period Schage. Clement's
fullback, got the ball on a double pass
and scored a touchdown. It was th'e
cleverest play of the Â¦ game.

Young Corbett will be fit and ready
when he steps into the ring at.Wood
ward's Pavilion to. give. Battling Nel
son a good time on the 29th jnst. Cor
bett has settled down to work with a
determined air and is not overlooking
any points that might give him addi
tional-etrength. He feels he needs all
the vitality and hitting power he can
possibly accumulate when he meets
Nelson. He realizes that if he loses
this fight he will shine no more as a
star of the twenty-four- foot ring.
The Denverite keeps Billy Otts and
Henry Tuthill busy out at the Beach
tavern every day. He is doing all kinds
of stunts, from road running to bag
punching, and the superfluous, flesh Is
gradually being shed. It will take only
a matter of a few days. for the former
champion to make the weight. He an
ticipates a bruising fight and is fitting
himself for Just such a mixup.
Teddy Murphy, manager of Battling
Nelson, would like to match his boy
with Britt should Nelson be successful
In getting, rid of Cotbett. . Murphy in
slgts on 130 pounds at 6 o'clock. Brltt
is auoted as saying he will make that
weight no more, but if he sees a goodly
purse . in sight he may change >is
mind, Just as he did when he agreed
to" take on Mn Gans a few weeks ago.
Murphy has not yet j approached
Britt, but says he intends to see to the
matter shortly. "A. good many of the
sporting fraternity do not concede Nel
son a chance and say that Murphy ' is
ridding himself of a little excess con
versation.. Nelson is liable to. surprise
many and in case he does stow Cor
bett away he will surely be the man
for Britt to mix with. ,
A few bets have been made with
Corbett a 7 to 10 choice. The best
Judges of price think the .odds will
finally settle at 6 to 10.

Coach Lanagan dld^not desire to make
the trip, but Treasurer Barrett could

Catcher Hogan's hand in the fourth

smashed Lynch. Their hits, coupled
with errors by the twisted team got
Seattle five runs. Hall pitched gilt
edge ball, allowing only four hits. A
feature of the game was a sensational

horse in umbrella time, and he turned
the trick cleverly in the six furlong
sprint, third to be decided. Cousin
Carrie was installed favorite, but she
prefers dry going, and, while, display
ing some speed, obtained nothing. J.
T. Sheehan. astride ...Bard Burns,
which ma^re finally closed about equal
choice with Carrie, early picked up
the running, and never caused much
uneasiness for the chestnut horse's
backers. Dr. Sherman, a 20 to 1
shot, with McBride up. took the place
from Oronte by a nose. Flaneur, a
well played one, was slow to set in
motion or he might have won*.
Looking like a well-groomed 1 to 2
chance, the ring laid as good as 11 to
to 10 about Charley "Henshall's Ish
lana in the betting on the seven fur
long selling number. The filly out
classed her field shoes to plates, and
scampered home by herself. W.
Davis brought Briers, an 8 to 1 shot,
up from the rear, headinjr out North
West for the place. Dungannon
came in for string support, but ran
disappointingly.
Perhaps the track was not just to
the liking of Stroller, for it was heavy,
while the Chicago gelding has shown
a penchant for a sloppy footing. How
ever, he was not the only favorite to
go by the board, for Honlton and Lady
Atheling kept him company. An in
creased number of bookmakers laid
odds, and unusual activity was ap
parent in the betting ring.
After his defeat of Honiton the lay
ers will probably show more respect
to Andrew B. Cook. The pair men
tioned, together with four lesser lights,
met in a five furlong scramble. Honl
ton had the call at even money. Cook
was first quoted at fours, which price
gradually fell to 12 to 5. The favorite
met with ill luck at the start, being
bumped, which gave Cook an oppor
tunity to sneak away. At the end Hon
iton was pressing the leader, but could
not overhaul him, and the "bush
cyclone" got the decision by more than
a length. Garnet Ferguson's Military
Man ran an excellent third.
Jockey Joe Jones had the mount
on Lady Atheling, favorite " for the
opening event, but he could not un
load the mare among the first three.
Molta. which was passed around as
an all-right piece of calico, led into
the stretch, but failed to last, finishing
third. The winner turned up in Con
ger, a 30* to 1 shot, with Herbert in
the pilot house, which beat Black
thorn out a length. Away better
Karabel could have won.
ISILLAXA SHOWS CLu\SS.
Stroller was bumped at the start, but
recovered quickly and when a quarter
had been left behind showed a neck
in front of Bombardier. There Mich
aels, riding the latter, bade farewell to
Dominick, and Bombardier went on and
won in Pretty Polly style. The favorite
had to be kicked out to secure the
place from Grafter, by a quarter of a
dozen lengths.
TRACK IS HEAVY.
Wally Brinkworth's Stroller caused
mourning in many a camp at Oakland
track yesterday when he finished sec
ond to Bombardier in the mile handi
cap. It looked as if the Chicago mud
lark, if he lived up to his reputation,
might have a sociable time df it, for
there were only four starters.
He was asked to carry 112 pounds,
but this did not feaze his admirers, for
they unloaded at 4 to 5 and 7 to 10.
Bombardier, a disappointment in the
opening handicap, was invited to par
ticipate with 104 poundsâ which he did.
Grafter and Past Knight completed the
quartet.

ISBLANA WINS EASILY
"When Jimmy Whalen and Ham Ibers
Bet real eaasy and decide to mix it
something is bound to be pulled off.
For years they were pals and perform
ed cm the same team. Now they are
enemies and each likes to hand it out
to the other. They" hooked up at
Recreation Park yesterday and battled
and battled, with the glory evenly di
vided till the eighth spasm, when the
Seals plucked a run and nelped Jimmy
triumph over Ham. Score: San Fran
cisco 1, Portland 0.
Just an hour and nineteen minutes
were whisked off from the time Wha
len tossed the first ball over the pan
until Runkle made the final out by
flying to Waldron. Into those seventy
nine minutes we're crowded flashes of
the best and fastest baseball the
fans nave feasted their eyes on in
many moons. No one erred and every
star on the rival teams was doing his
best to outshine his neighbor.
The run the Seals gatheredÂ«-tlurinK
the eighth round was an earned one
and worthy of their efforts. Whalen
had been retired when Hildebrand sin
gled out to the right garden. Meany
followed with a clever drive nearly to
the Scoreboard, pending Hildebrand
around to third. Cap Irwln picked out
a fast one and sent it right through the
infield, giving Hllde ample time to
score the only one for the day. Meany
was advanced to third on the play. A
moment later he was frozen at the
plate while trying to pull off a double
steal in company with Irwln.
The Brownies had a chance in the
seventh, but bad Judgment cost them a
run and possibly the game. Runkle
opened it up with -a smashing two
bagger to deep left and Shay singled
directly over second. Runkle started
for the pan and then changed his mind,
hesitating while a few feet from the
bag. Shay in the meantime was tear
ing into second, while Whalen had the
ball. Runkle was slightly rattled and
Whalen even more so. Finally Runkle
made up his mind to run and Whalen
at about the same time decided to
throw the ball to the plaie, where Run
kle was an easy out. >
Shay did some startling work at
short, as did Spencer ana Anderson at
second. Both pitchers excelled their
usual stunts in the box and the game
was almost a perfect one to gaxe upon.
Walter Christie again used the indica
tor and did his work well. The score*

' While building railroads in Tennessee
some twelve years ago a number of hands
contracted fever and various forms of
blood and skin diseases. I carried S. S. S.
in tn j commissary and gave it to my hands
with most gratifying results. I can recom-
mend S. S. S. as the finest preparation for
Malaria, chills and fever, as well as all
blood and skin diseases. W.I. McGowan.
I suffered greatly from Boils, which
would break out on different parts of my
body. I saw S. S. S. advertised and after
using about three bottles I was cured,
Â«ad Tor the last three years have had no
trouble whatever. A- W. ZEBER.

I began using your S. S. S. probaBly ten
years ago for Malaria and blood troubles,
and it proved so good that I have con-
tinued ever since using it as a family
remedy. It is a pleasure for me to recom-
zncad S. S. S. for the benefit of others
who are needing a first rate blood purifier,
tonic and cure for Malaria.

Sir. and Mrs. Bailey were on a

Santa. Barbara they met a herd of
longrh'bfn steers being driven along
â¢the : 'rSSSway. When the' automobile
dashed in among the cattle there was
a stampede, but the animals did not
run from the machine. They rather
crowded toward, it and were so an
gered that the occupants thought
their lives in danger and Bailey at
last was compelled to draw his pistol
and fire into the pawing and bellow

"away, but not before the automobile
was wrecked by the crowding herd.

A sentry's frantic cry of "Fire"
caused a panic on board the army
trnnrport Thomas on the afternoon of
Nov*mb# 12, when the troopship was
plowing her way here from Honolu
! lu. Within two minutes every officer
| and member of the crew had responded
I to the call and each man was at his
j'appointed. station.- Before- the passen
Â¦ gers had found the seat of danger a
i hose was pouring water on a pile of
'blazing linen, and within ' fl-.-<5 minutes
, Captain Lynarh, the commander of the
j vti jel, had :Â¦ thrown overboard several
i armfuls of .blazing cloth, , and 4nÂ«
Â¦ nounced the danger a thing of the past.

; threatening danger traveled faster and

of calming"' the passengers : found their
hands full. Transport passengers, for
tunately, havVa keen appreciation of
1 the value of discipline and order was
! restored before a welcome whistle an-
I nounced the passing of the danger.
When over their scare the passengers
found time to admire the splendid
; manner In which Captain Lynam and
i his officers had responded to the emer
i gency and all on board returned to
their books, cards, naps and love talks
inspired ivith full confidence In the
skipper's ability to^take care of them,
no matter what happened.
| The odor erf burning cloth had been
detected for some time before the
guard realized that the smell meant
fire. When he finally awoke to the se
rious possibilities of the situation he
; made an investigation, ai\d when he
; discovered smoke pouring from the

At the conclusion of the. address, the
bell was removed from the building: to
a heavy truck. As this was being done,
the assemblage stood in silence with
bared heads. A battalion of the Philip
pine constabulary, headed by their
band, escorted the bell to the west end
of the Palace of Transportation, where
the precious relic was placed on board

The Seven Sisters left here May 15
for Alaska, where she spent the half
year freighting and trading along the
coast Captain Campbell reports that
on September SO. in KoUcebue Sound,
â¢.carrier pigeon new aboard and was
caught. Attached to its leg was a. tug
on which was written :â "Captain Arm
strong, Fish River. All well."
The little schooner Seven Sisters of
Seattle, Captain Campbell In com
mand, came into port yesterday forty
seven days from Kotzebue Sound.
Every man on board, from skipper to
cook, had his belt drawn tight, and
the gleam of hunger was in every eye.
In the vessel's hold wu part of Alaa
ka for ballast. In the calley was a
dying: fire and an Idle, hungry cook.
Every ounce of food had been con
sumed and of drinking water there
was not enough left to make coffee.
"Tow you In to-morrow," sang out
Captain Dan Thompson of the tug
Sea Rover, bound home in a hurry.
"No, you won't!" replied Captain
Campbell. "You'll take us now.
We're hungry!"
That was an appeal no sailorman
will turn from and the Sea Rover
passed a hawser to the foodless
schooner and brought her to an an
chorage off Melggs wharf.
The run from Kotzebue Sound cc
cupled a longer time than Captain
Campbell had calculated for and as
the voyage lengthened out the supply
of drinking water ana food steadily
approached the zero mark. Zero In
the food lockers was reached Tueeday
afternoon, and heavy weather that
would have driven the schooner off
shore would have added the torture of
thirst to the discomfort of empty
Btomachs. The wind was kind, how
ever, and the timely passing of the
Sea Rover saved the little company on
the Seven Sisters from grievous suffer
ing. As soon as the anchor chain had
bÂ«en paid out. sails furled and every
thing made snug, all hands went
tshore, anfl when they called for
toothpicks and checks one water front
restaurant was in need of a fresh sup

held the boat at the place, where; the

the boat seemd to be very sluggish
in responding to. the >ars, but, had no
idea of the reason until the landing
was reached. Then the man from
whdm they rented the boat said:
"Jedge, you don't look' drunk "and you

A Very Lame Excuse.
Cnrriculnm Hnd Early Origin.
The fir at appearance of anything ap
proaching auniversity curriculum, said
Professor E. A.. Gardner In a recent ad
dress at University College, London, oc
curred in ancient Athens during Its
most flourishing period. The "ephebi,"
as the undergraduates were called,
were .-organized on a. military system.
The 'university calendar was published
annually. ; It, was. inscribed on marble
slabs and set up in the market place
of the city. The. slabs contained a
'complete'? list of the matriculated un
dergraduates, of "each year and were
documents of the . highest Importance,
for all the political and civil rights of
an : Atr:enian : citizen depended upon the
appearance -of his name on the regis
ter.âNew York j Commercial. . . -. ;J Â¦ '.
;By all odds- the greatest promoter of
temperance in the last sixty years has
been the change in business of every
description which has especially marked
that period- Everywhere the machine
has 'superseded the man or the woman.
This is as notable on the farm and in
the farmer's home as In town. In man
ufacturing, mining, engineering, trans
portation and almost all other business
pursuits, the individual worker has. be
come- part '-,of _* the machine and the
mechanism is too costly to be intrusted
to .the direction or manipulation of a
man whose brain is liable to be be
fogged. In transportation and, to a
less. extent, in mining and manufacture,
not only the' safety of property, but of
life, depends upon the sobriety of em
ployes.âWashington Post. . .

O. .L. Anderes, brother of-the miss
ing man. notified Chief of Police Witt
man of this city shortly after the
young man's disappearance, but the
Chief could not get a single clew that
would help trace the missing man. W.
J Elliott, whose office la in the Emma
Spreckels building, has been making a
search for Anderes In behalf of the
Woodmen of this city.
The Modern Woodmen of America
are making heroic efforts to locate one
Edgar C. Anderes of Argentine, Kans..
who is supposed to have disappeared
in this city during the Grand Army
Encampment last year. Anderea ar
rived here and intended to sail for
Australia a few dayg later. He wrote
to his brother in the Kansas town to
that effect and then strangely dropped
from sight.
Â¦ Anderes was 23 years old, 5 feet 10
inches In height and weighed about
170 pounds. He was of dark com
plexion and of rather striking appear
ance. He was a prominent member
o* the Modern Woodmen of America
and a man of apparently good habit3.
Hia relatives have been striving foe
more than a year to locate him and
fear he has met with foul play.
Edgar C. Anderes, Who Came Ilere
During Grand Army Encampment,
Disappears Mysteriously.

Quotations for everything remain, as before.
The Hay circular of Somers & Co. says:
! "There seems to be a steady lessening in
! shipments of j hay. for during the week Just
' ended we have received but 21*00 tons, In com
j parlson with 2700 tons for last week and 3300
I for the week preceding that. In spite of the
i comparatively light shipments we have been
receiving enough to supply the demand, for
I business has been very quiet, both as to local
1 trade and export demand. Cars are still
j scarce, and It is possible there would be a lit
tle more hay coming if orders for shipment
were filled promptly, but It Is reported that
Â¦ many, holders of hay have decided to with
hold 'shipments until a more favorable oppor
tunity.
â¢'Absolutely nothing of interest can be re
ported concerning the local situation, for al
though we have had two or three weeks of
fine weather, at the present writing It Is
raining again which will tend for a while
at least to prevent any further talk of a dry
winter. Green feed la abundant all over the
State, which is naturally lessening the con
j sumption of hay everywhere. A cold snap
I would destroy much of this, so we have no
1 reason to doubt that there will be , the
I regular winter's consumption of hay through
i out the Coast. x_
I "Most of the hay now being marketed Is
of the better grades of wheat and tame cat;
the poorer qualities are bÂ«ing held back and
therefore at present are in somewhat better
demand. We can note no change ,ln prices
and can see nothing in Bight at present that
promises any better figures for some little
time to come."

The continued decline in Butter has thus
far failed to stimulate the | demand and the
market is as dull and demoralized; as it was
when much higher. The ruling price for fine
creamery yesterday was 20c and some very
good brands were closed out at 18@19c.
Stocks continue large and unwieldy and In
clude more or less creamery that has been on
the market for several weeks. Of course this

Local trade In fresh fruits was quite active
and * good inquiry was noted for some de

' that quarter, . and a car of the well-known
8unflower brand is expected from Redlanda on
I Friday Trade In Apples was brisk, but the
[market was still weak, and. while there was
Â¦ no actual decline in prices, large buyers weio
I able to shade the quotations on extra and or
' dinary fancy stock. Five carloads of assorted
! stock arrived , from Oregon and Washington,
I but they had . not been hauled to the store*
I up to a late hour. Crated Orapes were wanted
' for shipment to Puget Sound ports and choice
offerings cleaned up readily at &0c@$M0 per

1 sales above $1 CO per box were rare. Another
car of Eastern Cranberries was received and
was held at $11 per barrel, an advance. Rasp

CHICAGO, Nov. 1Câ Before the opening in
the wheat pit to-day traders were greeted with
an official statement of the world's shipments
and of the visible supply. Both totals being:
alscoura&ins to the bulls, sentiment at first
was rather bearish. Another factor contribut
ing to the easier tone was a decline In all for
eign grain markets. Liverpool was down ovÂ«r
half a cent. Initial quotations on December were
He lower to Vie higher at $1 10^(31 ll'A.
May was *Jc lower to Vic higher at $1 ll'HÂ®
I 11%. For a time there was general selling
and prices slumped, txjeember to ?1 10% and
May to 81 10"i. Shorts took advantage of the
break and in covering sales caused an upward
movement In prices. As the session advanced
the buying became more general and resulted
in a strong undertone. The improved demand
wn* attributed mainly to a revival in cash
business at all important grain centers. A
message from Minneapolis stated that the de
mand for cash wheat there was the best ex
perienced thus far on the crop. â¢ One explana
tion of the sudden development of the demand
fcr cash wheat In the Northwest was the prs
rfumiJtlcn that millers had either made some
large sales of flour or that they had comÂ« Into
the market for future supplies because of the
dip in prices. In this connection a message
from the Pacific Cosst stating that It was
hinted there that Japan will be forced to buy
immenw stocks of American flour within a
f"w weeks was considered significant. During
the last r>art of the Bession â¢ prices steadily
advanced until December touched $1 12>4 and
May $1 12%. The close was almost at the
highest point of the day, final quotations on
December being l%@Uic higher at $1 11%@
1 12. May closed lHc up at |1 12%.
Strength of wheat was.. the main factor In
the corn market. December closed 1U<5 up at
5Ui651%c. â¢ '
Oats were firm. December closed Uc up at
2$!*c.
Buying by packers and covering by shorts
caused a strong provision market. The close

NEW YORK. Nov. 16.â Value* of securities
shewed themselves sensitive to-day to the re

cf friction in tfcÂ« negotiations between Ruwia
and Great Britain over the North Sea trouble.
Th* uneasiness was accentuated in London
by CbÂ« r,Â«?w s of a hontll"! collision on the Af
ghanistan frontier. But the cpecial pensitive
rÂ«^w of the New York stock market to theÂ«e
ra:hÂ»r remote factors was probably due. more
to the fact that the gradual restoration of
telegn r*'e facilities to outside centers failed
to bring in the expected accumulation of buy
tr.g which has been obstructed all week. There
was Â«omÂ« vigorous opposition to the reaction
Â«t the opening, but the supporting tactics be
.aTrie lar.suid whÂ»n the llghtneiw of the ln
ircafed bu>-lng crders was perceived. A fairly
e*nrral reaction followed. The later Improve

of the clay'* business for account of that cap

the recent absorptive pewer of the market has

Judge Seawell yesterday issued an
order restraining California Harbor
No. 15, American Association of Mas
ters and Pilots of Steam Vessels, from
interfering with William A. Wescott
in the exerclse'of his duties as a mem
ber of the society. Wescott sued last
December for an. injunction and $10,-,
000 damages. The damages were not
granted. On -November 23 of last
year Wescott was attending a meet'ng
of the society and was impertinent to
Harbor Captain D. S.. Ames. He was
told to "shut ' up" and' at the next
meeting was . denied admission. On
December 4 he was notified that he
had .been suspended- for twelve
months. The harbor answers the suit
with a plea that Wescott's actions
were unbecoming a gentleman and in
violation of order and good moral).

Judge Sloss yesterday heard the ap
plications of P. Marslcano for ,writs
of prohibition and mandate " agalhst
the Police Court and took the matters
under submission. - The petitioner,
representing that he had been ar
rested several times as owner of the
house at 1129 Dupont street, used for
Immoral purposes, seeks to prevent
the Police Court from trying the
charges in the order of filing the com
plaints, and to compel it to try the
last of the charges first. His attorney.
George D. Collins, argued that the of
fense was a continuous one and could
not be split up into separate accusa
tions and prosecutions. He said that
his demand upon the Police Judge for
trial of the last case first had been de
nied. Attorneys Kuhl and Hanley,
representing the Police Department,
would nqt concede that the offense
was continuous, and contended that
the petitioner "could find other relief
by pleading prior conviction or . ac
quittal if tried on another case after
the first had been heard.
"Slarslcano Writs Argued.

lated the contestant's version : of
toward events and 'conditions' of Ber
tha M. Dolbeer's life history that were
calculated to. produce .Â« an unsound
mind. With this statement , before
him Dr. - Robertson" expressed the
opinion ;that she was insane when she
made her will- and. when she met her
death. , He was j then led through Â¦ a
detailed description of the symptoms
of simple .melancholia, whlch;:would
be- his diagnosis of . a case as -pre

Court opened with the deposition
of Gustav Scholer, Coroner of New
York, which was read. His answer
that it would have been Impossible
for a person to fall out of the win
dow in the Waldorf -Astor Hotel,, as
in contended Miss Dolbeer did. was
ruled out. Nor ..was the -.account of
his interview with Miss Warren when
he arrived on the scene of the fatality
allowed to reach â¢ the ears of the
Jurors. Â¦ â¢ . â¢
Then began the production of ex
pert testimony on insanity." Dr. John
W. Robertson, superintendent of the
I.ivermore . Sanatorium. ' was first
called, and he was examined as to his
'experience with mental and nervous
diseases.
Miss Etta Warren, the chief bene
ficiary under Miss Dolbeer's will, was
not present in court yesterday be
cause of illness. This was her first
absence since the taking of testimony
began. Adolph Schander, the other
chief party in interest, did not appear,
being confined to. his home with
rheumatism. He was represented by
his son and. his daughter.
' The close of proceedings in behalf
of the contestants was marked by an
offer of expert testimony. . Three ex
perienced physicians gave it as their
opinion that. in the hypothetical case
set forth by Attorney Johnson .. the
person was of unsound mind.
At a time when much testimony
was looked for. and about a week Â¦ in
advance of general calculations, the
contestant in the Dolbeer will case
yesterday announced the close of his
case. There was surprise in Judge
Coffey's court.- for fThad been thought
that only the Â¦ beginning was made in,

FEY'S COURT THAT A PERSON WITH SYMPTOMS ALLEGED BY THE CONTESTANT AS HAV1NU BKEN SHOWN UY
MISS BERTHA DOLUEER WAS OF UNSOUND MIND. .-
The defendant's attorneys claimed
they had the right to submit affidavits
attacking the action of the Grand
Jury. Assistant District Attorney Fer
ral argued that if they had such a
right then matter could be introduced
of an extraneous nature which could
not be received by the court. If they
had not the right they could not be
accused of committing perjury. Argu
ment on this point was" continued till
to-morrow.
After argument It was agreed that
the evidence of Judge Sloss.be taken
to enable him to leave. The Judge
testified that on October 13 members
of the Grand Jury came into his court
and he was informed they had a com
munication to make. The roll was
called and only ten answered. Fore
man Ldlienfeld informed .him that
three members were in the Grand Jury
room who had refused to come into
court. At the request of Foreman
LJlienfeld he instructed the Sheriff to
bring the three Jurors into court. The
roll was again called and fourteen an
swered to their names. Thereupon the
foreman presented the indictment and
asked that it be placed on the secret
file.'
In the case of Rebstock, who is
charged with violating the election law
by refusing while an inspector at the
primary election to administer the
oath to a voter whose vote was chal
lenged, Attorneys O'Grady and New
burg filed a motion to set aside the
indictment on numerous grounds.
Among them was the allegation that
the indictment was found without the
concurrence of twelve members of the
Grand ' Jury and the constitutional
ground that prior to the filing of the
indictment the defendant against his
will was compelled to appear before
the Grand Jury and testify as a wit
ness ngalnst himself. An affidavit to
the same effect by the defendant was
also filed. : â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢
as decided by the Supreme Court in a
similar case as late as September 30,
and it was not therefore necessary to
proceed in the name of the people.
The accusation, was made and process
followed . under sections 758, 759 and
760 of |he Penal Code.
"If tne process is defective," said
the Judge, "the accusation is defec
tive."
Byington took exception to that
view and the Judge continued the
argument till this morning'.

When Mr. and Mrs. Whittell quietly
returned to San Francisco a few days
ago the young husband called upon
several of his friends for counsel, and
acting upon their advice, opened nego
tiations with his parents for a recon
ciliation. Just how far his effort has
progressed is not generally known, but
there is reason to believe that the
father is preparing to welcome his son
to the family fireside. According to ad
missions made by young Whittell, his
pleas for an allowance have not been
ignored by his father and as evidence
of this the son has exhibited wads of
rape:- money to substantiate his claim
that his parent is not entirely relent
less and will soon issue orders to the
family cook to kill the fatted calf and
fpstoon the California street mansion
â¢with garlands.
Apparently, however. Baker, shrewd
as he is accredited with being, was de
ceived by George Whittell, for one day
the latter suddenly disappeared from
Paris and the next that Baker learned
of his charge was that he had crossed
the Atlantic and had quietly married
Miss Cunningham in New York city.
Since then BaJter has been in Paris re
covering from a violent attack of
chagTin.
George Whittell, son of the well
kaown capitalist, whose infatuation for
Josie Cunningham, the actress, brought
upon him paternal wrath and who mar
ried the young woman recently in New
Fork city, has returned to San Fran
cisco with his bride and has already be
gun to seek peace with his family. Mr.
and Mrs. Whittell arrived from New
York several days ago and are occupy
ing apartments on Geary street.
Young wnittell's departure from San
Francisco several months ago was at
tended with considerable speculation on
the part of his friends as to whether
he would abandon the pretty woman
who had been directly responsible for
the breach between himself and his
stern father. It was no secret among
his friends that his trip to Europe was
carefully planned by his father with a
view of disabusing his son's mind of
intention of marrying Miss Cunning
ham. To safeguard against a- matri
monial alliance Ray Baker of OaJdand
v.as sent along with young Whittell as
a companion and from all accounts re
reived from Part 3 the pair had a gay
time in the French capital. Baker,
from time to time, reported to Whittell
St. that the son's infatuation for Miss
Cunningham was being rapidly di
minished. "â¢ -
At this stage Attorney T. V.. Cator,
who Is associate counsel with, Johnson,
said he had an objection to make to
the process in regard to the accusa
tion. He claimed that the defendants
were not in court legally and submitted
a motion objecting to any proceeding
by the court against the defendants or
to their being placed on trial upon the
accusation or to any Judgment against
them because no legal or lawful pro
cess had been issued in said proceed
ing or upon said accusation or been
served upon the defendants or either of
them. .
â¢ "If the parties are not in court law
fully," said the Judge, "then you can
not make a motion for a continuance."
Addressing Cator. the Judge said: "I
will hear your motion at once."
Cator demurred, as he - wished to
prepare himself with authorities, but
the Judge was insistent, saying the de
fendants could not occupy a double
position.
Cator then argued at considerable
length In support of his motion. He
contended . that under section 20.
article VI of the constitution, every
process, .civil or criminal, must foe in
the name of the people. Therefore
the tiling of an accusation by the
Grand Jury and a notice annexed-to It
by. the District Attorney that copies
had been served UDon the Commis
sioners was illegal. The accusation
should' have been made in the name of
the people.
District Attorney Byington replied
that it was not a criminal prosecution.
The first case called was that of
Wyman for arraignment. Attorney
Edwards asked that the arraignment
go over till Saturday, as the testimony
in the Police Court was not yet trans
cribed. The Judge ordered that the
stenographer of Police Judge Cabaniss"
court be notified to Have the testimony
transcribed at once, insisted that
the arraignment ': be proceeded with.
The defendant was arraigned and the
Judge said that If any motion was de
sired on behalf of the defendant it
could be made when the defendant was
asked to plead. The case was continued
till, Saturday on the suggestion of As
sistant District Attorney Ferral.
â¢ When the accusation against the
Election Commissioners was called
Attorney Hiram Johnson said that the
commissioners were ; busily engaged
every day canvassing the election re
turns and asked for a continuance till
after the canvass was concluded. At
the proper time he had a motion to
make and he would submit his" author
ities to the District Attorney before
the next calling of the case so that the
District Attorney would be prepared to
argue it.
. Election Commissioner -Voorsanger
was asked by the Judge how long it
would take to canvass the returns and
he replied about two weeks.
Attorney Johnson thought that a con
tinuance till November 26 would an
swer all requirements.
OBJECTS TO PROCESS.
WYMAN' IS ARRAIGNED.
There was an animated scene In
Judge Lawlor's courtroom ! yesterday
morning. The case of Charles Wyman,

tion Commissioners, accused of mis
feasance in office, were on the calendar.

!Of a cough, especially of infants

until the cough becomes hard, the
throat inflamed and the lungs and
bronchial passages congested.
Avoid cough remedies that contain
opiates, stupefying drugs and dan-
gerous anodynes. They only
quiet the symptomsâ drug the
cough into silence â but that is not
curing. A weak place is left to
t cause trouble later. A remedy
