Hours.
Report ol a Demonstration

Story of an Anarchist Plot Also Causes
Him to Modify Original Pro
gramme
TANGIER. March 31.â Emperor Wil
liam of Germany paid a flying visit to
Tangier to-day, remaining barely two
hour* on shore. The elaborate pro
gramme for his reception and enter
tainment was much changed, the Em
peror confining hirr.p^'f to a visit to
the German legation, where he re
ceived deputai :mans in 114
rocco.
The changes in the plans caused
much comment and disappointment.
The Emperor had been expected to
land about 8 o'clock, but he was de
layed three hours. Meanwhile Count
Tattenbat h-Askold. formerly Ger
stw to Morocco, returned to
Hamburg before the Emperor land
;â  w-aa oAciail] â¢ xplained that the
n foi this procedure was the
roughnÂ«-se of the sea. but after the de
parture of thÂ«- Hamburg, it was said
. od. authority that Emperor Wil
liam having heard that there wag a
: ility of a Francc-phobe demon
stration on the occasion of his visit,
. to avoid such an incident.
Another report which, however, has
not received official confirmation, but
is generally accepted, says that the
German legation was informed that
an anarchist plat had been discovered
-ad advised that the Emperor be
?ded from landing. Copnt yon
-Askold visited the Germa i
legation and talked with the Moorish
authorities and afterward informed his
Maje*t> that every precaution had
been taken, but advised that the pro
me be confined too a visit to the
on.
withstanding the shortness of
in Tangier, the oc
casion was one of the most brilliant
and picturesque in the history of this
seaport. The Moors exhibited unwont
ed enthusiasm and throughout the two
hours the Emperor was on shore no
untoward incident occurred. â¢
The scenes in the streets gave evi
dence of the sincerity of the welcome.
Thf procession from the pier to the le
gation was exceedingly imposing.. The
uniforms of the Emperor and his suite
mingled picturesquely with the native
costumes and local coloring, while the
music of the Sultan's band added a
touch of true Orientalism. The cere
monies strangely contrasted with that
at other places viEited. His Majesty
*vas especially cordial toward the Ger
man colonists, whom he assured that
he would always maintain the rights
and interests of German subjects in
Morocco. Before his departure for
Gibraltar. Emperor "William bestowed
decorations on Mulai Abd El Malek
and the deputation sent to welcome
him.

PURE FOODS
INSURED BY
GOVERNMENT
A. F. Gould Named
as Cbemist by Ex- .
pert Bigelow.
Laboratory for Analysis ol
Imports to Be Located
in This City.
Warning Given That California Olive
Oil Is Being Adulterated hy
Some Dealers.
Announcement was made by Dr. W.
D. Bigelow at the University of Cali
fornia yesterday that A. F. Gould, a
University graduate of the chemistry
department, has been chosen to serve
as chief of the newly established Gov
ernment laboratory for the analysis of
imported food products in this city. Dr.
Big^lov. is now directing the prelimin
ary work of the laboratory. He is
chief of the division of foods, bureau of
chemistry, of the United States De
partment of Agriculture, "a recognized
authority on expert analysis of food
products and the laws that relate to
such inspection.
Dr. Bigelow made his announcement
concerning Mr. Goulds appointment at
a meeting of the Agricultural cmb,
l.eld yesterday mornin- in the Agricul
tural building at the university. Mr.
Gould has been stationed at Mare Isl
and recently in the Government serv
ice. He graduated from the Univer
sity of California four years agd. His
new post is regarded as an important
and responsible office.
The analysis of imported food prod
ucts coming into the port is in line
with the Government's policy of es
t.i Wishing such laboratories in all
ports, when practicable, to aid in the
enforcement of the imported food law.
Dr. Big-eJou Jj&ctured for an hour .be
fore the Agricultural Club m Berkeley
yesterday explaining this law and in
cidentally informing the club of the
history of food adulteration legislation.
He said in part:
NOT A MODERN EVIL.
'Food adulteration is not a modern
evil. Wines were adulterated in the
time of Pliny. Scir-ntific methods for
detecting adulterated products, how
ever, are of modern origin. Sixty years
ago the first serious attempts were
made to stop adulteration. England
passed a law of this sort, thenlÃer
many, then France. In America we
have had legislation, but often without
being able to enforce it. There are now
laAvs of this sort in twenty States. The
Federal Government is not able to in
terfere in inspection of food products
prepared and sold in a State, except in
a few instances.
"Politics often interfere with the en
forcement of food laws by State Food
Commissioners. Kentucky is an ex
ception. In Oregon, Washington and
Connecticut chemical analysis of sus
pected foods is made for State officials
at experiment stations of the Govern
ment and this expedites the enforce
ment of the lawg.
"The national Government is able to
limit and practically to suppress adult
eration of cheese, butter and spiritous
liquorE, by taxing the adulterated prod
uct. The mixed flour bill, prepared at
the request of American millers who
saw their jealously guarded reputation
in danger of destruction in European
markets, through the mixing of corn
flour with the wheat, has done away
with that evil.
SUCCESS OF LAW.
"The imported food law is strictly
enforced, and it prevents the importa
tion of adulterated food products with
marked success. The law was passed
in 1903. becoming operative in July of
that year. All American Consuls
abroad are instructed to send to the
Agricultural Department at home a
copy of Invoices of shipments that are
being made to American ports. We are
guided by these invoices, and able thus
to keep account of what is coming in.
Our agents secure samples, which are
examined, and, it adulterated, are con
demned, after the importer haa every
chance to prove that a mistake has
been made by us.
"The results have been so satisfac
tory that many products, hitherto
grossly adulterated now come into the
country- absolutely pure, among these
being olive oil, in which California is,
|of course, interested. I have to say,
. however, that while we are pretty cer
tain to keep out imported olive oil of
1 doubtful purity, still there Is being sold
[ in this State much adulterated olive
oil, labeled as pure California olive oil.
W> know that the producer is not re
j sponsible for this adulteration. Who,
1 then, is responsible? That is a ques
; tinr. which it will be up to the State
! of California to answer."

GRAND JURY GRILLS POLICE BOARD
Department Noiv Agrees to Join in Crusade to Stamp Out Poolroom Evil
The Police Commission
ers walked the carpet be
fore the Grand Jury last
night. There were many
things in the way of
neglect to enforce the law
that the board was called
Qn to explain. Much at
tention was given to the
poolroom matter. The
(irand Jury's demand that
the gambling places must
be closed was acceded to.
and a vigorous campaign
on the part of the Police
Department, acting in co
operation with the inquis- .
itorial body, is to begin
forthwith. The coiifer
ence was conducted in a
spirit of good nature, and
the v exciting proceedings
looked for did not ma
terialize.
Blame Is Shifted to
Judges in Many
Instances.
Light Fines Nullify
the Detectives'
Efforts.
The Police Commissioners Joined the
Grand Jury in- a conference last night
and were taken to account for the
many instances of failure on the part
of the department to enforce the law.
They were ready with explanations,
some having "it and others not, the
Grand Jurors thought. The principal
matter taken up was that of the pool
rooms, over a hundred of which have
been allowed to do a flourishing busi
ness. The difficulties of making suc
cessful prosecution were set forth at
length by the members of the board
and Acting Chief Spillane, blame be
ing laid to the Police Judges, but the
upshot of the discussion was that a
vigorous campaign against the gam
bling resorts is now to be made by the
police, aided by the Grand Jury, which
already has much evidence in its pos
session.
The conference was held in Judge
Lawlor's courtroom at the Hall of Jus
tice. The first inquiry made of the
Commission was concerning the case
of Policeman McNamara, whose only
punishment was a reprimand for allow
ing Mrs. Berlin to escape from him
after he had arrested her in a place
where pools were sold. She is a friend
of Mayor Schmitz. The Commission
ers said that they had deemed the
reprimand a sufficient penalty, not re
garding the policeman's conduct aa
flagrant.
MOOXEY TAKES BLAME.
The board disclaimed all responsibil
ity for the arrest of a member of the
real estate firm with which Juror
Bowes is connected for displaying "to
let' signs. Captain Mooney takes all
blame for this strange action, that bore
the earmarks of spite work.
â¢'Policeman McMurray was taken
from the Grand Jury assignment and
Detective Braig detailed instead, be
cause it is the policy of the board to
give the more competent men the
easiest posts of duty," was President
Poheim's strange explanation of the
recent transfer.
The Commissioners said the Police
Judges, by levying ridiculously small
fines, made it impossible to wage a
successful campaign against the nu
merous places where liquor 1b sold
without a license. The board promised
to notify the Jury the next time such
an offense is called to its attention, that
some vigorous measures might be
taken against the courts.
Acting Chief Spillane informed the
Grand Jury that two patrolmen were
detailed to try to stop the sale of lot
tery tickets. The Commissioners again
chunted blame to the Police Judges,
who, they said, would never impose
salutary fines on offenders.
RESORT PROTECTED.
k The Grand Jury demanded an ac
counting of the fact that Pratt & Tier
ney's notorious deadfall was permitted
to have piano playing and carousing
crowds through thft night. But there
was no explanation of the immunity
the disreputable place seems to enjoy
from the police. The board promised to
instruct Captain Duke to bring the re
sort's managers up with a round turn.
The Grand Jury has collected evi
dence against many saloons where
pools are sold, and President Pohelm
announced that if the proof was pre
sented to the board the liquor licenses
would be revoked. Foreman Andrews
will start the crusade at once. It was
agreed that the board and the Grand
Jury should work together with all
vigfir to stamp out the poolroom evil.
Acting <"hief Spillane told at length
what has been done by, the police. The
strictures made on the attitude of the
Prlice Judges toward the offenders
were severe. The Grand J"ry decided
that it would call the Judges into a
conference that will be held this morn
ing at 10 o'clock.
An indictment was returned by the
Grand Jury against Ai:;.ew â Yates. the
bellboy who robbed a room of several
thousand dollars' worth of valuables at
f
the Dorchester Hotel several months
NEW CHIEF XOT YET NAMED.
Police Com mission Adjourns Early
to Consrlt With Grand Jury.
The Police Commissioners did not
name a new Chief of Police last
night, as was expected. The meeting
of the Commissioners was a very
brief one and the members went into
session v :Â»h the members of the
Grajid Jury as soon as they ad
journed.
Alexander O'Grady. the newly ap
pointed Commissioner, was present
and ready to be sworn in. However,
he had not gone through the formal
ity of arranging for his bond, so the
board decided 0 postpone the install
ation till the nÂ«oct meeting. The Com
mission did not transact any import
ant business owing to the fact that
the Grand Jury was anxious to con
sult with them.
Patrolman Fred W. Franch was
found guilty of visiting a saloon and
severely reprimanded. Patrolman
Wiliam C. Casey was also found
guilty of visiting a saloon with a
woman while on duty and fined $50.
Chief of Police Spilliane last night
changed the Chinatown squad and the
new men wiU take their places at
once. Sergeant Cook has been ill for
some time and he asked Spilliane to
shift him. which the Chief consented
to do. Corporal Ross Ferguson will
have charge of the squad and a new
detail of men will be. under him.

SPIL-LANE'S AFFIDAVITS
CONFUSE CIGAR DEALERS
Proof That Complainants Soil Pools
Results in Continuance of Suits
for Injunctions.
About a dozen cigar store keepers
appeared in Judge SeaweH's depart
ment of the Superior Court yesterday
to press their suits for perpetual in
junctions restraining the police from
blockading their places of business.
They were met in each case, however,
by affidavits filed by acting Chief
Spillane, in which the affiants set
forth that they have direct evidence
to establish the contention of the po
lice that the plaintiff cigar dealers
are engaged in pool selling.
This unlooked for turn of affairs
had the effect of somewhat embar
rassing 1 the cigar dealers and their
counsel, with the result that they
asked for a continuance until Monday
that they might more closely examine
the affidavits and meet them with
counter affidavits. Judge Seawell
granted the motion, but said that if
the plaintiffs are not ready to pro
ceed on Monday the court will dis
solve the temporary restraining or
ders heretofore issued. This will per
mit the police to again take up their
vigil in front of the stores of the com
plainants.
BECOME CRAZED
BY TRAVELING
CHEYENNE, Wya, March 31.â S.
Baker and wife, en route from Michi
gan to Azusa, Cal., were so affected
by 'the excitement of travel and the
altitude yesterday between Sidney and
Cheyenne that they became crazed,
Baker's dementia taking a violent
turn. With a large revolver, he com
pelled all of the passengers in the
coach in which he was traveling to
move into other coaches and fright
ened the trainmen so badly that they
left him in possession of the coach.
Finally about thirty miles east of
Cheyenne, Bert Center of Idaho Falls,
Ida., entered the car, Informed Baker
that he was an officer and demanded
his weapon. Baker surrendered with
out a struggle.
When the train reached Cheyenne
Baker and his wife were taken to a
hotel, where they remained last night
under the eye of an officer. This
morning both hud regained their nor
mal f.-vrulties and were permitted to
resume their journey.
Although each is nearly 50 years
of age, neither Baker nor his wife had
ever been on a railway train before
and the novelty of travel so affected
them that neither ate or slept be
tween their starting point and Chey
enne. They were overcome by the
combined effect of novelty and alti
tude.

NEW ORGAN
OF TASTE
DISCOVERED
WelcomesDrinksanu
Foods That Are
Palatable.
Sj^oia! LHspatch to The Ca'.l.
CHICAGO. March SI.â A wonderful
discovery has been made by Professor
J. T. Wilson of the University of Chi
cago. It is a new organ of taste, and
the noted pedagogue calls it "tasle
bud. "
It is to be found in the larynx, and
all over the coating of the passage
throuph the neck. Experiments have
proved that it is just below the sur
face of the lining, it is bud-shaped.
Just what individual, function the
new organ has Professor Wilson does
not know. He declares that it repels
drinks and foods having a sour taste
and "welcomes those having a sweet
taste. Anything .sour or ill-tasting that
goes down the throat makes the "taste
bud" contract. This is commonly
known as "lump-in-the-throat."
Strong drinks and strong food, the
professor declares, are not welcomed
by the "taste bud." When a girl tastes
Hour pickles the new orgran dislikes it
very much. But when the girl eats a
bonbon it's all right. It is the same way
with man. adds the discoverer. When
a man drinks something sweet, tor in
stance an icecream soda, it is all right,
but when he drinks something sour,
then it rebels. Under such treatment
the "taste bud" becomes excited and
Bwells up.
Scientists consider Professor Wilson's
discovery of the new organ of wonder
ful value to mankind.

applause.
"France's Moroccan policy," Deleave
said, "continues on the same conditions
as it was begun. The Sultan's weak
ness and the anarchy resulting there
from were prejudicial to everybody,
and especially to France, in Algeria.
We had to seek a remedy for the intol
erable situation without allowing our
action to awaken the suspicions of
other nations. France does not pretend
to base her interests on disregard lor
the interests of others. Thence arose
negotiations resulting in agreements
proclaiming that France possesses such
a special standing in Morocco. The
Anglo-French treaty recognizes that.it
is France's task to assist in opening
Morocco to civilization, and also that
from the economic- point of view all na
tions have' an equal footing there. The
Fran co -Spanish agreement confirms
these views. The. terms of the Anglo-
French treaty were immediately com
municated to the Sultan; of this fact
the issue of the Moroccan loan by
France is proof. If France sought a
pretext for intervention one existed in
the disturbed state of the Algerian
frontier. However, from friendship for
Morocco Â«nd a clear conceptidn of her
own interests. France merely pointed
out the necessity for establishing order.
That position we' still hold.

Ml*. FORCIBLE WORDS.
LONDON. April 1. â According to
lal Ofapatcfeea from Tangier,
â  ror William In his speech at the
:i. s;ud:
"There is no preponderating influ
ence in Morocco. Germany must en
joy the same rights as other powers.
"We guarantee that the sovereignty of
Morocco shall and will be maintained."
This rather defiant version is prob
ably too free a statement of the Em
peror's words, but it serves as a peg
on which London newspapers hang
further querulous editorials and criti
cisms as to the meaning of his visit.
The Times Tangier correspondent says:
'Jt -is impossible to deny that' the
Emperor's visit, which the world
wished to consider as that of an impe
rial ttmrist, has been an immense po
litical -demonstration. Nobody, who
saw Tangier to-day garlanded with
flowers and beflagged, could doubt that
such expenditure and trouble -meant
more than merely a courteous welcome
to an Emperor desirous of seeing the
'curiosities of Tangier. I was able to
â wat* h the Emperor during all his in
terviews ami noticed the forcible man
ner in which he gpoke, especially to the
Sultan's uncle. The brief two hours
hÂ« spent here may prove to have
marked an eppch in the history of Mo
rocco. He is reported to have spoken
most emphatically to German subjects
at jh â  legation, but no official account
of his remarks is obtainable."

POLICE FOIL
PLOT TO KILL
Arrest Terrorist Who Was
Watching for Opportunity
to Assassinate Trepoff
THIRTY PEESONS TO DIE
St. Petersburg Authorities
Learn That Grand Duke
Alexis Is on Doomed List
ST. PETERSBURG, March 81.â The
authorities continue to find evidence
of terrorist activity in St. Petersburg,
and in spite of the precautions of the
pojjee another tragedy may occur at
any moment. The fighting organiza
tion is known to have on its condem
nation list thirty persons, headed by
Grand Duke Alexis and Governor Gen
eral Trepoff, but the police, although
they have arrested several persons
with bombs in their possession, and
have taken many suspects into cus
tody, have been completely baffled in
their efforts to discover the invisible
hand which is directing the campaign
of the terrorists. The police theory
continues to be that the central or
ganizations of those engaged in the
conspiracies are at Geneva and in
Paris, and that the men arrested in
Russia are agents selected to execute
the sentences.
When arrested these agents invaria
bly are true to their oaths and refuse
to divulge anything, no matter to what
ordeal they are subjected. Only yes
terday the police by chance foiled what
is believed to have been a plot to kill
Governor General Trepoff.
A man was observed during the
morning lounging at the corner of
Great MorÃkaia street, about a block
away from the entrance to General
Trepoff's chancellory. He attracted no
attention at first, as he wore the red
cup which is the distinctive mark of
the employes of the messenger com
pany, whose messengers stand at every
street corner, but at last a policeman
noticed that the man's face was not
familiar to him, and approached the
supposed messenger with the object of
interrogating him. The man thereupon
became alarmed, drew a revolver and
fired at the policeman, but missed him.
The policeman then overpowered his
assailant and arrested him.
Almost at the same hour that the
bogus messenger was being arrested on
<ireat Morskaia street the police, who
have been keeping a sharp lookout at
the hotels and lodging-houses, discov
ered pevera! bombs of the terrorist pat
tern in a trunk belonging to a stranger
who occupied furnished room? in a
hÂ«.usp on Pushkin street, but who wat
alxsent at the time the police searched
his apartment. The man was taken
into custody when he returned, and
last night two men who called to see
him also were arrested. All the prison
ers declined to give any account of
themselves.
Although the police are reticent, re- i
fusing to furnifh any information or;
give the names of the prisoners, the two
incidents â the arrest of the man on
Great Morskaia street and the finding
of the bombs â are undoubtedly con
nected. The man captured by the po
lice on Great Morskaia street probably
was on the lookout for some mark by
which to distinguish General Trepoff's
carriage, as several vehicles of the
same style &M constantly before the
Governor GerJeral chancellory, and
when he drtves out they circle around
and leave in different directions, so that
it is almost impossible in the confusion
to determine definitely which carriage
contains the Governor General. It is
said that General Trepoff a fortnight'
ago received a letter informing him
that this ruse was unavailing, as he
would be killed in his bed.
The police have instructed all lodg
ing-houses to provide themselves with
duplicate keys of all rooms, drawers
and closets in order that the effects of
suspects may be freely searched.

JAPANESE ARMY
BEGINS ADVANCE
Field Marshal Oyama Is Moving His Main
Forces With the Object of Envelop
ing the Russian Position.
Diplomats Believe That Hopes of Early Peace
Have Vanished and That the War
Will Be Continued.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 31.â The
news from the front to-day indicates
that Field Marshal Oyama has begun
a genuine advance of his main army
with wings far extended. Heavy
reconnoissances are being made
against the Russian center, with the
object of enveloping the Russian po
sition.
A dispatch from General Linevltch,
dated March 30, says:
"There is no change in the situation.
The enemy is displaying activity east
of the railroad.
"Heavy snow fell during the night.
A telegram from Gunshu Pass says
General Linevitch has forbidden the
inhabitants of Harbin, with the ex
ception of the women and children, to
leave that place without special per
mits, fearing that the town may be de
nuded of workmeni
It is officially announced that Gen
eral Karkivitch has been appointed
General Linevitch's chief of staff in
place of <;oneral Sakharoff, who has
been transferred to the Alexander com
mittee for the care of the wounded.
General Stakelberg has also been ap
pointed a member of the same commit
tee.
NO HOPE OF PEACE.
Official Denial That Russia Asked
Uncle Sam to Mediate.
WASHINGTON, March 31.â 0f con
siderable interest because of French
activity In the cause of peace was the
call upon President Roosevelt to-day
of M. Jusserand. the French Embas
sador. The purpose of the call was
announced as his desire to say good
by to the President before he leaves
Washington on Monday. But M. Jus
sorand sees no present hope of peace.
Said he: "Although it seems to be the
wish everywhere, certainly in this
country and my country, that peace
be declared, there appears to be no dis
position on the part of Russia and
.Japan to end hostilities at this time.
"At all events, I do net think the
Government <>f the United States is
considering as yet any official move
toward intervention. The Presided,
however, did not mention this, and Â£
did not broach it to him."
It was officially denied at the White
House to-day that Russia had asked
the United States to mediate for the
purpose of ending the war.
FARIS, March 31.â Whatever hope
fulness the peace situation may have
had some days ago the situation has
i'ow completely changed, and there is
every prospect lhat the war will drag
on again. Consequently dispatches ap
pearing in America saying that For
eign Minister Delcasse and Dr. Mo
tono, the Japanese Minister to Franc?,
have been conferring at the former's
house relative to peace are inaccurate.
The foregoing \iew of the situation is
taken by the parties immediately con
cerned, and it is asserted with the au
thority of the Foreign Office and the
Japanese legation.
A press correspondent has talked
lengthily with Dr. Motono during the
last few days and the situation here
tofore set forth in these dispatches re
flected -the view of Dr. Motono and
others directly concerned, although
with the usual reservation of not us
infe their names. However, in view of
the continued reports that there were
indications that Minister Delcasse and
Dâ¢. Motono were taking an active
part in the negotiations the corre
spondent called at the Japanese lega
tion to-day and requested Dr. Motono
to furnish a decisive statement Which
would put at rest all misunderstand
ings. Accordingly the Minister gave
the following categorical statement,
which was taken in writing and may
be accepted as authoritatively clear
ing the situation:
"I tell you explicitly that there are
io peace negotiations or preliminaries
for initiating peace in progress at this
time so far as I am aware, and 1 be
lieve my information to be complete.
1 am not desirous of discussing the
general question of peace, for owing
to the complete absence of negotia
tions or preliminaries toward nego
tiations that question can only be
academic and without political bear
ing.
â¢The statements that I have con
ferred with M. Delcasse at his resi
dence are false and are calculated to
confuse a situation Â« hich is perfectly
plain. There is no representative of
Japan authorized at this time to dis
cuss peace or foreshadow in the least
what conditions the Japanese Gov
ernment' might consider if the nego
tiations assumed a practical stage. On
the contrary, Japan is now engaged
in conducting a military campaign,
and she will resolutely proceed with
that important work."
CHINESE BANDITS ACTIVE.
Japanese Success Is Doing Much to
Augment Their Movement.
GUNSHU PASS, March 31. â Recon
noissanccs disclope special activity on
the part of the Japanese on the west
near the Mongolian frontier. It is re
ported that an anti-foreign propa
ganda is conducted among the Chinese,
who are stirred up to a renewal of
the Boxer disturbances. The Hun
yuanmin societies of Mukden and
Kirin and the Tsal Li Society, which
is strong in Tsitsihar and Northern
Manchuria, are said to be working to
spVead this agitation among the Man
churian population, and Japanese suc
cess is doing much to augment the
movement. Many Chinese bandit
chieftains are leaders in numerous
secret societies extending throughout
China and their influence may have a
powerful effect on the attitude of the
Chinese Government and people.
RUSSIA STANDS FIRM.
Will Not Cede Territory or Pay Indem-
nity in Event of Peace.
ST. PETERSBURG. March 3Lâ lt is
difficult to shed light on the peace pour
parlers. From all information ob
tainable it is regarded as certain that
actual negotiations between the bellig
erents are not yet under way, but the
task of bringing them together is pro
ceeding informally through the United
States and France in the persons of
President Roosevelt and M. Delcasse,
the French Foreign Minister, who have
been apprised of Russia's irreducible
minimum, which, in addition to no ces
sion of territory or indemnity, is be
lieved to include a guarantee of the
right of way over the Siberian Railroad
to Vladivostok through Northern Man
churia. It is possible that there may
be a pause before the next move
occurs.
The diplomatists here generally be
lieve that the negotiations, once be
gun, will be conducted directly between
representatives of the warring coun
tries. One very prominent diplomat,
however, expressed the opinion that all
the powers are likely to be drawn In
and that there might be a congress of
Berlin. He pointed out that the pow
ers interested commercially in China
were vitally concerned in safeguard
ing the open-door policy to which they
were pledged, and must be consulted
as to the future status of Manchuria
and co'lateral questions, such as the
possible internationalization of the
Eastern Chinese Railroad, etc. He de
sired it to be understood, however, that
he did not mean that the powers would
attempt to rob Japan of the fruits of
victory. Such a congress might be held
after Russia and Japan had concluded
peace.
PRISONERS KILL THEMSELVES.
Japanese Held at Medveti Prefer
Death to Imprisonment.
ST. PETERSBURG. April I.â The
Bourse Gazette prints a report that a
number of Japanese prisoners at
Medved have killed themselves by
hara-kiri and with arsenic. Gossip
in some circles in St. Petersburg at
tributes the suicides to ill-treatment.
The American embassy has not been
advised on the subject. A short time
ago at the request of Japan the em
bassy sent a representative to Medved
to investigate the complaints by pris
oners of war and reported with the ex
ception of a few miner details, which
the Russian Government undertook to
correct, the Russian arrangements
were admirable.
DECLINES TO NEGOTIATE.
Rumor That .lapnn Will Not IJsten to
Rtissia's Terms.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 1, 1:20
a. m. â A report current late last night
that Japan has declined to negotiate
for peace on Russia's basis cannot be
traced to any responsible source.
CHURCH WANTS
MORE FREEDOM
ST. PETERSBURG. April I.â A move
ment for severing the traditional rela
tions between church and state and
giving to the Holy Orthodox church in
dependence and separate rule, which
will increase its influence among the
people of Russia, has found favor with
an important group of clergymen at
the capital. A noteworthy document
setting forth the views of those of this
persuasion, which was presented to the
Metropolitan Antonius of St. Peters
burg, has been received with sufficient
consideration to insure its publication
in the Church Messenger, the official
organ of the diocese of St. Petersburg
and one of the most important re
ligious papers in the realm.
The document, after arguing that th< j
church should free itself of obligations
to the state in order to lend all its en
ergies to the prosecution of its own
special work and eliminate the suspi
cion that its ministrations may be
inclined toward worldly ends and in
terests, demands the summoning of a
general council of the church to con
sider means of attaining the greater
freedom required.
POWELL MAY
BE RECALLED
Special Dispatch to The Can
WASHINGTON. March 31.â The re
call of Minister Powell may be made
necessary because of his report to the
State Department that a revolution is
impending in Hayti and his request
that a warship be sent there to protect
American interests. Minister Leger of
Hayti to-day sent a letter to Acting
Secretary Adee, in which he repeated
his previous declarations that absolute
quiet prevails in Hayti and that no dis
turbances are expected. This was fol
lowed by a formal memorandum, in
which regret was politely expressed
that Minister Powell should advise the
department that a revolution is threat
ened in the island. It was pointed out
that such utterances are damaging, be
cause they impair the country's finan
cial stancMng and mitigate against its
commercial interests. The Brooklyn has
not yet reached Guantanamo, and con
sequently has not received her orders to
proceed to Port au Prince, 180 miles
distant.
PHILADELPHIA PROMOTER

Stanley Francis, accused of being one
of the promoters and directors of the
concern, was to-day remanded for trial
by United States. Commissioner Craig

postal authorities. The two important
witnesses againÃt the accused man
were Miss Margaret Hope, a stenog
rapher, and Miss Gertrude Sundheim,

W. E. Bamber Not
at Desk When
Sought
C. W. Weaver, manager -tor- the Stude
| baker Brothers Company, carriage
\, manufacturers. Tenth and MarKet
J streets, obtained warrants from Police
I, Judge Conlan yesterday for the arrest
j of W. E. Bamber, cashier for the com-
I pany, on two charges of felony embez
j zlement. The amounts named in the
I complaints are $78 50 on March 10 and
I $58 on March 17, but it is said that the
I total amount so far discovered will
reach'about $1000, and this sum may be
i considerably augmented after next col-
X lection day.
Bamber has been cashier for the com
pany for about three years. He lived in
apartments at the St. Kathryn Hotel,
Jones and Ellis streets. He has a wife
and child, who are at present in Los
Gatos, and his father is a real estate
agent In Santa Cruz.
He was last seen in the office on Sat
urday, March 18, and when he failed to
make his appearance on the following
Monday suspicion was aroused. A few
days ago a customer called at the of
fice and he was asked if he had paid
his account, and he replied that he had
paid the cashier on March 11. An ex
amination of the cash book showed no
entry for the amount on that or any
subsequent date. An expert was called
in and it soon developed that Bamber
had been receiving money from cus
tomers and appropriating it to his own
uses.
The police were notified and Detec
tives Dinan and Wren were detailed on
the case. They ascertained that Bam
ber had been a prominent figure in the
"redlight district" and squandered
money lavishly on women -of the half
world. His whereabouts are p.t present
unknown, but Dinan and Wren expect
to be able to get on his trail soon.
AMERICA WILL
LOSE NO TIME
WASHINGTON, March 31.â Minister
Dawson cabled the State Department
to-day from San Domingo that he had
received the departments approval of
what he has done respecting the finan
cial agreement governing the collec
tion and disbursement of Dominican
customs and that he had notified the
Minister for Foreign Affairs that Presi
dent Roosevelt acquiesced in the plan
of settlement.
It is expected that the arrangement
will be formally ratified in San Do
mingo and as soon as .Secretary Taft
returns to Washington the force of
American collectors to take charge of
th c Dominican custom-houses will be
completed and they will be dispatched
to their respective posts without de
lay. If passible they will endeavor to
reach San Juan, Porto Rica, on one of
the regular liners in time to take pass
age from there to Santo Domingo with
Professor Hollander on the cruiser
Chattanooga, which has been assigned
to that duty.
The cruiser Newark, which sailed
from Guantanamo on V'ednesday, has
arrived at Monti Cristi and reported to
the Navy Department.
It is learned that in enswer to the
representations of John Bsssett Moore,
which were in the nature of a protest
against the interference with the exe
cution of the award in favor of the
San Domingo Improvement Company,
he has been informed that under the
operation of the new agreement all
of the customs collections at the Dom
inican ports, save the 45 per cent Â«roing
to the support of the Government, are
to be kept on deposit in .New York,
but that the company will lose no right
it now has. The question of the dis
tribution of the muney, supposing the
treaty is ratified, will not be settled
in advance. It is expected that the
American custom collectors will be
paid by the Dominican Government.
INSANE WOMAN
DUPES WOOERS
Si*cial Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, March 31.â Sixteen gold
rings, about $100 in money and much
valuable raiment is what Mrs. Edna
Kenton, an inmate of the Lincoln hos
pital for the insane, secured through
the medium of a Denver matrimonial
bureau and her promises to marry
more than a score of men. Postoffice
inspectors who have been investigating
the actions of the woman declare they
have found one of the strangest cases
in their experiences. Though clearly
insane, the woman has shown extraor
dinary skill in letter writing and has
found a host of admirers in all parts of
the country. To all of them she repre
sented herself as dwelling "in a mag
nificent castle ef stone and brick, sur
rounded by the most beautiful grounds
and abundant flowers." with scores of
servants to attend and administer to
her every want. The description of her
castles tallies well with that of the hos
pital where she is confined. Finally one
of her zealous admirers, who is said to
have come all the way from California!
to marry a beautiful heiress, reported
to the postofflce authorities how he had
been misled. The fact of her insanity
saves her from being amenable to the
law.

of the suspected woman brushes

that the robber had a revolver. Mrs.
Zazzi is certain fhat the man did not

The police ..suspicions rest on the
fact that the woman's brother, Emile
Modeste. and the woman were seen
conversing earnestly, in an icecream

Union street, Ml the night of the rob

an hour.
Judge S. F. Leib of this city and
Mountford S. Wilson of the firm of
Wilson & Wilson of San Francisco, who
were the legal advisers of Mrs. Stan

the will filed as that of Mrs. Stanford,
i and stated that the will was in his own
\ handwriting and drawn up by him at.
Mrs. Stanford's direction. The will was
signed in the library of her home in the
presence of Mr. Wilson. Robert G.
Hooker, Charles H. Lovell and T. F.
Draper. Wilson declared that at the
, time the will was signed Mrs. Stanford
' was in full possession <>f her mental
faculties. He said the codicil was in
Mrs. Stanford's own handwriting; that
it had been sent to him by Mrs. Stan
ford after it had been drawn up, in
August, 1904. and that it had been in
his^ possession from that time until it
was filed. He knew nothing of its con
tents until the will was opened after
her death.
Charles K. Lovell, an attorney at law,
testified that he knew Mrs. Stanford at
the time she signed the ML He cor
roborated Wilsons testimony. Robert
G. Hooker and T. F. Draper, the other
of the will, gave similar tes-
timony.

to the will was drawn up in San

Stanford was on a visit here. She had
sent for Mr. Leib and intimated her
Wlabei to him. He prepared a rough
draft of a codicil for her. which sh^.

witness declared, was in possession of
all her mental faculties.

Stanford; Timothy Hopkins, Joseph D.
Gnint. Whitelaw Reid, who was re
cently appointed Minister to the Court
of St. Jam~s by President Roosevelt,

named as executors of the will, were
also examined. They each said Mrs.
Stanford was of sound mind at the
time the will was mad*.
Russell J. Wilson, who had also been
named as an executor, did not apply
for letters testamentary, and waived
all rights in that direction.
Judge Hyland then made an order
appointing Charles G. Lathrop, TUn

the Smiths are held without warrant;
that no charge has been placed against
them, and that there is no authority in j
law for the detention of either, hus
batfid or wife.
When arrested yesterday the two.

EXHIBIT OF FISH AND GAME
OPENS AT PAVILION.
SPOUTSMCN PEVCL IN THE MINIATUPE FORESTS
ONE OF THE POPULAR EXHIBITS AT THK FOREST FISH AND UAME ASSOCIATIONS FIRST EXHIBITION LAST NIGHT
AT THE MECHANICS" PAVILION FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LYING-IN HOSPITAL. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, THE
FOUNDLING ASYLUM AND THE TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES.
The long looked for exhibition of the
Pacific Coast Forest, Fish and Game
Association began last night with a
great reception tendered by the asso
ciation to its many friends throughout
the city, and to-day the exhibition will
be thrown open to the public. Many
handsomely gowned women and fault
lessly dresses! men were present. A
large orchestra, led by Theodore Vogt,
added gayety to the evening.
The dingy interior of the Mechanics'
Pavilion is completely transformed by
the artist* in woodcraft, who have
made the building a bower in Eden.
The only accurate idea one can have
of the wonders that are set forth in
everchanging array is to make several
visits to the exposition. To the lovers
of nature and outdoor life the place
will be a Mecca during the two weeks
the exhibition will run.
After passing the shield of cedar
trees at the door the visitor is con
fronted by a panoramic view of the
Sierras at the end of the Pavilion.
Hocks, trees and shrubbery lead in per
spective from this background so as to
form a narrow gorge, through which
runs a miniature mountain torrent. The
stream culminates in a twenty-foot
waterfall into a pretty lake that is bor
dered by rushes and stretches of beach.
The surface of the lake is broken in
place? hy rocka, and many varieties of
wild game glide on Its waters. Fronting
the lake is a grove of pines, with vel
vet paths running through and plenty
of resting places scattered about.
THE EXHIBITS.
Around the sides of the Pavilion are
ranged the various exhibits of the as
sociation. Trappers' outfits, camping
implements, booths of the Olympic and
Bohemian clubs, encampments of naval
jackies from the Yerba Buena training
station, artillerymen from the Presidio
and Government surveyors' tents and
outfits mingle with the tepees of the
Navajos, whose gaudy blankets add
color to the scene.
Wire corrals are scattered through
out the floor. They contain many va
rieties of game, also beasts of prey.
Trout and black bass Hash back and
:<>rth In glass tanks, while tree trunks
form the % yries of eagles and vultures.
I'pstairs in the galleries is a magnifi
cent art o> llection. and one side of the
building is given over to a handsome
txhjliition of polished and curious
woods.
On tho platform near the entrance
m ere seated the speakers of the even
ing and the officers of the association.
William Qraer Harrison, president of
the Hssooiation. introduced the first
,-I>eakei. James O. Phelan, vice presi
dent. Mr. Phelan said:

portions, and hence some of us need to be
constantly reminded or the varied resources
und multifarious attractions of the country in
which we live, born but yesterdayâ an un
broken wildernessâ and still glorious with the
virility and beauty of youth.
Nature fairly revels in California. Here
every valley and mountain bids the tired deni
paa of the city to enjoy its opulence and
grandeur. From remote placet large numbers
of people flock to this State because they have
discovered, by comparison with other lands,
that California is a sportsman's paradise â the
garden ot the world.
Once 1 heard a ' busy New Yorker, chained
to the chariot wheels of commerce, exclaim :
"What are you doing away from home? If I
had my way I would live and stay in Cali
fornia." He was asked were not the oppor
tunities for business greater where he was.
"YeÂ»." he sadly answered, ''but the opportuni
ties for living are less." He said that within
easy distance of California cities one could in
dulge in every eportâ in fishing. In shooting. In
camping out, in mountain climbing, under fair
skiee, every month of the' year.
And this Is true, and one of the objects of
this exhibition is to reveal to the people of the
State and country the magnificence of our her
itage. No State can compare with California
In the variety of her game, her birds, her flsh,
nnr In her mountains, her forests and her val
leys: and, Jf we can bring these facts home to
nur own people, we will not only have en
hanced the glory of our State, but we will
have conferred a priceless boon upon those
who are wise enough to enjoy her bounteous
hospitality In forest and by stream.
NATIRE A MORALIZER.
If we can (urn men from an artificial to a
natural life we will have served a high and
w.rthy purpose. Vigor, inspiration, Joy, the
exultation of the spirit and the glow of health
come from a more intimate acquaintance with
the woods and the grass's and the streams,
peopled by strange objects, too unfamiliar for
the most "part to city-bred men. IÂ»ngrfellow

OTHF.R SPEAKERS.
Dr. Frederick W. d' Evelyn followed
and spoke of the difficulties of getting
the exhibition started and. completed,
and the pride taken in thfe fact that
the work was thÂ« result of efforts of
the business men of the city.
Joaquin Miller then read a poetic in
vocation written by himself entitled,
"The Trees of Eden."
With a short parade by the Navajos
and a speech by the chief the ceremo
nial part of the evening closed and the
visitors were at liberty to roam among
the exhibits until 11 o'clock, when the
band played "Home, Sweet Home" and
the army and navy bugles rang out
"taps." Every Saturday morning from
10 to M o'clock will be special children's
day, when afl children will be admitted
for 10 cents. A special exhibition of
children's pets of all descriptions Is an
amusing feature of the show.
DETENTION HOME YOUTHS
PLAN TO MAKE ESCAPE
Charles Morris, tlie Ringleader. Gets
Away After Being Separated
From Others.
A plan of escape laid by several
youths who are held in the Detention
Home on Polk street awaiting trial in
the Juvenile Court *was frustrated by
one of the youths who informed Pro
bation Officer Hutton of the plot.
The ringleaders were Charles
("Puggy") Morris. 17 years old, who is
awaiting trial for burglary, and John
de Christina, who also has a bad rec
ord. Plans were laid to overpower
Superintendent Phelps when he ap
peared in the dormitory Wednesday
night, bind and gag him, and, with
the assistance of his keys, make their
escape. A deaf and dumb youth, who
was confined in the same apartment,
got Intimation of the attempt and told
Hutton of the conspiracy.
Young Morris was" placed in a room
by himpplf so he could not influence
the other boys. With the assistance of
a knife Morris unscrewed the door
from its hinses and climbed to the
top of the building. From there he
took a desperate jump to the ground
and made his escape.

STATEMENT OF BOARD.
It became known to-day that prior
to the final action by the prudential
committee of the American Board of
Commissioners of Foreign Missions In
accepting the $100, 000 gift tendered by
John D. Rockefeller a number of prom
inent members of the board, at a meet
ing held In New York City, considered
thfc matter %t length. As a result the
parties to ths conference issued a
statement in which they declared they
did not fcal that the acceptance of the
gift would compromise the board in
any way. Among those who signed
th? statement were Rev. J. \V. Cooper,
secretary of the American Missionary
Association: Lucien Warner, chairman
of the International Y. M. C. A.; Rev.
C. A. Richards, secretary of the Inter
national Congregational Church-build
ing Society: Rev. A. H. Bradford,
formerly moderator of the National
foneregational Conference; Rev. Ed
ward P. Ingersoll, secretary of the
Aim ican Bible Society; William H.
Ward, editor of the New York Inde
pendent; Rev. J. J. Merrill, president
of Fisk University, Nashville, Tenr.;
Rev. Frank K. Sanders, dean ov Yale
University Divinity School; Rev. lay
man Abbott; Rev. Charles Hi. Jeffer
son, pastor of the Broadway Taber
nacle, and Rev. Henry W. Hubbell of
Greenwich, Conn. The statement is
sued as a result of the meeting was as
follows:
The prudential committee of the American
board has been requested to refuse a certain
gift for its missionary work on tbe ground that
the giver is the president of a corporation,
whose business methods are extensively criti
cized by the press and the public. Compliance
with this request would put upon the board,
which is a corporate trust created for the
definite purpose of maintaining missions in
foreign lands, the very grave responsibility of
refusing money which has been given for the
development of the work Intrusted to Its care
in aid of particular objects for which it Is
trustee.
It would also establish the precedent of
subjecting individual gifts to a scrutiny not
heretofore regarded as practicable for a mis
sion board to exerrlge. We do not therefore
consider that the acceptance of this- gift com
promises the board in any way and' we cannot
recommend any departure from the long estab
lished usage of the board receiving with
thankfulness the funds intrusted to Its care

COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 31.â Dr.
Washington Gladden, moderator of the
General Council of the Congregational
Churches of the United States, to-night
gave out the following reply to the
statement of H. H. Rogers, vice presi
dent of the Standard .Oil Company:
Mr. Rogers alleges that the vast sums ex
torted In rebates by the Standard Oil I'om
pauy from its competitors were "legally"
taken because no law explicitly forbade them.
What I said was that th^ money was "flaKi
tlously" acquired. To coerce the railroads
into an arrangement by which It received a
large rebate on not only its own oil but on
all the oil sent by Its competitors; to force the
railways to rob Its competitors for its en
richment, was. I submit, a flagitious policy, a
shameful policy. If there was no law at that
time by which this particular kind of robbery
could be punished, the robbery was no less
flagrant and outrageous. It waÂ« by this means
that this enormous power was created.
I am not a lawyer, but I should think it al
together possible that even under thÂ« com
mon law such an iniquity as this might have
been punlxhed. Railways, which are chartered
under public law, must be required to render
to all fie p^pole an equal service. If such
use of them as was made by the Standard
OH Company could not br punished, our legal
machinery would be very defective.
The denial that rebates have been extorted
pine? the interstate commerce law waa passed
Is not credible. I know from statements made
to myself by parties Implicated that such re
bates have been exacted by other corporations.
I doubt If the Standard Oil Company Is more
virtuous than the rest. But It Is true that it
has now gained a power in the classification
and control of rates which makes it unneces
sary to use the system of rebates.
Some of the apologists of the trusts are now
asserting that the money now under discussion
has be*n legally acquired. "Legally." says a
New York paper, "there 1b no question that

OPPOSITION STIMi ACTIVK.
BOSTON, March 31. â The committee
which heads the protest of Congrega
tionalists against the action of the
American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions in accepting a gift of
$100,000 from John D. Rockefeller to
day issued a statement Inviting all per
sons, whether clergymen or laymen,
who wish to record themselves as in
sympathy with the protest to send their
names to the chairman of the commit
tee. Rev. Daniel Edwards of Cam
bridge. It was stated that many letters
indicating sympathy with the protest
were being received by different mem
bers of the committee, and that to fa
cilitate clerical work it wa* desired
that they should all come direct to a
common center.
One of the officials of the committee
to-day said that the protestants had a
plan to present to the prudential com
mittee of the American bnard in view
of the difficulty apparently presented
by the fact that the gift already had
been given and used in part, which
would be offered "at the proper time."
It is understood that if the protesting
clergymen fail to bring about a return
of the money already used and a re
pudiation of the gift they will ainVto
secure from the American board such
a declaration as will prevent the possi
bility of the recurrence of such a con
troversy as the present one.

CARACAS, March 31. â President
Arnal of the highest court to-day de

to fulfill its terms, and he decided
against the Government in the ac

company's acts. Five days are allow

A desire for a peaceable adjust

to-day. President Castro said:
"I have from the first seen that no
danger was likely to arise out of the
affairs which have unduly occupied
public attention. Aside from other
reasons, Venezuela places complete
confidence in the words of President
Roosevelt, who said: 'America's atti
tude toward all nations should be one
of cordial and sincere friendship. We
should show strongly our desire for
their good will by acting toward them
in a spirit of justice and generous rec
ognition of all their rights. We wish
pe.-ii'e. luit wish the peace of justice,
the peace of righteousness, x No weak
nation that acts rightly and justly
should ever have cause to fear us."
Venezuela asks no more than Mr.
Roosevelt proclaims.
"We hold that the French cable
case and the Bermudez case are iden
tical. Neither company has fulfilled
its contracts. Both favor revolution
ists here."
President Castro declared that the

the cost fell upon the actual purchaser.
The boy persistently dunned Mr. Weed

was wasted, and then he inaugurated a
system of reprisal, which mainly con
sisted of refusing to carry his debtor in

stairway, as his apartment was on a
high floor, and his wrath waxed apace
with his uds and downs until he be

puncture his torso. The original charge
was assault with a deadly weapon, but

XLAM), March 31.â The new city
officials will take office to-morrow, the
first day of April. This has been agreed
upon between the old and new admin
istrations, though there is no law to
show exactly when the Oakland mu
nicipal officers go into power. To
morruw Frank K. Mott will actively
assume the duties of his office, and
Warren ulney will retire. A 6 most of
the city ofhcials have been re-elected
to office there will be few immediate
changes at the City Hal!. The only
n. \v officials who have appointments to
make are Frank K. Mott and Charles
D. Bates Jr.
The great interest centers around the
actions of Mayor Mott, for he will be
expected to outline the policy of the
three great departments of the city,
the Street. Police and Fire depart
ments. This policy will not be an
nounced until the first meeting- of the
new Council, which will be on Monday
evening next, when Mayor Mott will
tesu- his first message. Between the
time that the new Mayor takes office
and the time that his message is pre
sented the administrative boards of the
city will be organized, and there may
be tome inkling dropped as to what
the new executive wants.
The Mayor, together with the City
Engineer and City Attorney, constitute
the. Board of -Public -Works.; and the
Board of Police and Fire Commission
ers, both of which boards will organ
ize to-morrow morning. Mayor Mott
will be made president of the Police
and Fire Commission, which would in
dicate that he intends to take an ac
tive baud in the shaping of both of
these departments. City Engineer
Turner will become president of the
Board of Public Works.
There will be a complete change in
the oilicials of the Board of Public
Works, who are also the officials for
the other board. W. B. F"awcett, now
secretary, and James Hammore, as
sistant secretary, will retire, and will
be succeeded by George E. Jackson
and Edward Terrell. These two offi
cials arc practically the secretaries to
the Mayor. The new boards will in the
future meet on Wednesday morning.
The only changes that will be made
in other offices will be the retirement
of K. S. Finch as Chief Deputy Treas
urer, to be succeeded by R. B. Ayer.
City Treasurer Bates has decided to
retain all of the Â»Â»â¦' â deputies now in
in..' oftce. Mr. Ayer is now chief clerk
in the Street Department. George
Flint, now in the Street Department;
W. H. Fawcett, retiring secretary of
the Board of Public Works, and E. S.

imitate his father in climbing to the
top of a windmill the three-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. John F. Corrigan
of North Oakland, fell fifty feet last
night and fractured his skull. A few
hours later the child died.
Tb<= little one had often noticed his
father climb the steps that led to the
top of the windmill and- tank. The
trips to the top had excited his curios
ity, and the little fellow wanted to ex
plore the mysterious regions up the big
stairway. Last evening he got away
from his parents, and started to make
the long ascent. He went to the top,
where he lost his balance and plunged
over the side to the ground.
His parents heard the fall and the
cry as the little one struck the ground.

conscious. The tiny skull had been
fractured and the neck broken. There
was still breath in the body, and Dr. A.
S. Kelley was called. He took the little
one to the East Bay Sanatorium,

he secured a rifle. He then entered the
hall, when he saw the burglar. Drop

SANTA FE WILL
SKIP STOCKTON
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
STOCKTON, March 31.â The Santa
Fe will not include Stockton In its pro
posed line to the northern country via
Sacramento if a letter received at the
Chamber of Commerce this morning
from Colonel W. H. Heuer of the Unit
ed States War Department is to
be ta':en as> an indication of the com
pany's intentions. The letter, which
throws an entirely new light upon the
proposed north coast route, in part is
as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. March 2fl. â Secretary of
the Stockton Chamber of Commerceâ Dear Sir:
Ai plication has been made to construct a
steel railway bridge, on piers, aoroaa the
eastern end of Sulsun Bay, between the Contra
Costa shore and Chipps Island.
The proposed bridge "Is to be 2721 feet In
lentrth and to consist of twelve fixed and one
movable span, the latter to have two open
ings, each 151 feet clear width for boats to
pass through.
Any one having an objection to the location
or plans of the saJd proposed bridge Is re
quested to state the same, with his reasons
therefor, to the undersigned, in writing, in
fl'iplli-ate on or before 2 o'clock p. m. April
15. 1906.' W. H. HEUER,
Colonel Corps Engineers, U. S. A.
Although the letter does not give
the name of the railroad making the
application, the general opinion here is
that it is a Santa Fe proposition. It
would indicate that the Santa Fe in
tends running a line north through So
lpno County to Sacramento. It has
long been known that the Santa Fe
contemplates? a nor.them coast line
through Lake and Mendocino counties
to Humboldt, the objective point being
Exireka.
In order to reach Chipps Island, a
branch will probably be taken from the
Santa Fe either at Black Diamond or
Cornwall, a small station a few miles
this side of Black Diamond. Point
Richmond probably will be used as the
terminus.

Battling Nelson was as mad as a
March hare yesterday when he hunted
up Charley Mitchell, expecting the lat
ter to sign for a handicap match be
tween White and Nelson. Mitchell
laughed at the fighting Dane and told
him he was only joking on the pre
vious day. The Dane thinks he has
been placed, in a false light with the
public and thinks there is an apology
due him fi*om Mitchell.
Nelson says of White: "If I can't
stop him in ten rounds I never want
to fight again."
If Manager Jim Coffroth fails to se
cure a permit on Monday from the
Board of Supervisors he will probably
have to stage the Britt-White affair at

that on the date of that engagement
there will be another fight in this city,
with Nelson as one of the principals.

AIIUAL SALE. TEN MiLUON SOXESDAUNTLESS BATTLES FOR WEEK WITH GREAT GALES
TUG RETURNS FROM A SEARCH FOR THE DERELICT G A. KLOSE
The Spreckels tug: Dauntless, Captain
John Shea, returned yesterday from
her cruit-e in search of the derelict
schooner C. A. Klose. She left here
March T4 and, with the exception of
one quift night passed at Astoria, she
was fighting gales all the time she was
away. The cruise occupied seven days
and the long, sound slumber obtained
a i Astoria was the only sleep that
came to the crew of the Dauntless dur
ing the stormy trip.
Afttr the Dauntless left here the
water-logged hull of the C. A. Klose
w Â«6 thrown by the sea on the rocks
of the Oregon Coast, but Captain Shea
did not learn this until he put into
Astoria after scouring the seas for the
abandoned schooner. It was blowing
hard when the Dauntless left here
about 9 o'clock an the evening of March
23. Once outside the headÃ the tow
boat plunged into the thick of some
f the tiirtust weather that has vis
ited this coast in many years. The
law of gravitj was defied by the sturdy
tug, and In the course of that night the
only evolutKfT. she did not perform was
the turning of a somersault. As a
submarine boat the Dauntless proved a
success and she took some nights
â¢uhich would have cheered the soul of
an airship-builder. During the cruise
the wind blew from all quarters at dif
ferent times, although once in a while
it seemed as if it was coming from
every quarter at the same time with
the Dauntless for a target.
Working a towboat under conditions
such as these is hungry work, but
cooking on a stove that is dancing like
a paddle wheel is no simple undertak
ing. It was a case of cook as cook
cau. Setting meals was out of the
question. There was many a slip be
tween cups and lips and more than
< nee the sea swallowed the hot
with which the weary sailorman
thought be was going to warm himself.
In spite of seas that swept the decks
waves that pounded with the
of twelve-Inch shells against the
Dauntless' superstructure, the tug
passed through the ordeal without a
s^ign of hurt, and within an hour after
her return yesterday she was busy
vith another Job. Although everybody
was worn out, only one member of the
crew sustained any injury. The second
assistant engineer was watching a
chance to leave the engine-room. Sev
eral times he opened the iron door lead-
Ing to the deck and closed It in time to
shut out a heavy sea. He thought he
saw h:s chance, opened the door, was
stepping out ready to make a rush,
when bang came a wave, slamming the
door Jn his face and throwing him back
with considerable violence. One of his
fiugers had caught in the door and was
amputated as neatly as a surgeon's
Id have performed the opera-
Curacao Conies From Mexico.

FIRE ENGINE
STRIKES CAR
CHICAGO, March 31.â Five firemen
were injured and two fire engines dis
abled to-day while responding to an
alarm for a small fire in Market street.
A collision with a crowded electric car
at Jackson boulevard and Clark street,
the breakdown of another engine and
an explosion in the building accounted
for the men's Injuries, which consisted
of broken legs, bruises and cuts.
All the windows of the electric car
were shattered by the collision and a
score of passengers became jammed in
the doors in the rush for safety. The
wrath of the firemen was aroused by
the collision, and after assisting the
injured men to a drug store they ran
to the car and threatened the crew.
The latter retreated, and while other
street railway men stood guard the car
was hurried away.
HICH OFFICIALS
CLOSE TO DUEL
PARIS. March 31.â A duel between
General Brugrere, the commanding gen
eral of the army, and M. Pelletan, late
Minister of Marine, has narrowly been
averted. Pelletan wrote an article
which General Brugere considered of
fensive. Accordingly the general named
Generals Duchesne and Metzinger,
members of the Superior^ Council of
War, as his seconds. Pefletan's sec
onds were; Senator Clemenceau and
Deputy Masse. A meeting of the sec
onds led to a decision that the article
did not warrant a duel.
WILL REGULATE
BUTTER WEIGHT
Dealers Plan to Establish
Uniform Method to Pack
Chief Product of Dairy
ADOPT EESOLUTIONS
Committee 1$ Appointed to
Notify All Concerned of
Wishes of Wholesalers
Threatened with the loss of the but
ter trade of the north, some of which
has already gone, owing to the system
of uncertain weights as butter has been
put up in this State, a large number of
butter dealers gathered in the rooms of
the San Francisco Board of Trade yes
terday afternoon and took steps to se
cure uniformity in the sizes of pack
ages. Some talk took place, but on vote
under roll call practical unanimity was
obtained in the adoption of resolutions
that are of interest to the trade, to<all
creameries and to all producers of but
ter on the Pacific Coast.
W. H. Roussel presided and B. F.
Harville acted as secretary. The full
text of the resolutions adopted is as
follows:
Whereas The Legislature of the State of
California ' has enacted a law requiring the
marking of the weight of butter contained In
all retail packages of butter; and whereas,
we recognize the law has for Its object the
promotion of greater uniformity in the con
duct of the butter trade, and to bring about
a much-desired uniformity in the style of
packing butter for retail purposes, thereby fa
cilitating trade and enabling our product to
command a wider market, which is essential
to the continued prosperity of our dairy in
terests, and the maintenance of San Fran
cisco as a market of export and a butter cen
ter, and ac under the law there is no ad
vantage to be gained in making retail pack
ages of butter except of uniform weight;
therefore.
Resolved, That we, the wholesale butter
dealers of San Francisco, agree Individually
and collectively to do all In our power to adopt
and encourage the making and general use
of a standard sized package or squares and
none other, which square shall contain either
ono or two pound*' weight of butter. A stand
ard one pound square of butter shall be of
the dimensions one and a half by three inches,
and of length sufficient to contain one pound:
and a standard two pqund square shall be of
the dimension of three by three Inches, and
of length sufficient to contain two pounds. Be
it further
Resolved, That we. the wholesale dealers in
butter, agree to do all in our power to secure,
the enforcement of the law as now consti
tuted, and that we will immediately notify
the proper authorities of any discrepancies in
the weight of butter packages coming within
the law, or any violation thereof, and upon
the receipt of butter packages in which the
law has been violated we will Immediately
notify and warn the shipper to rectify the
error In the future. Be It further
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
forwarded to the Humboldt County Creamery
Exchange, the Creamery Operators' Exchange,
the creamery men and dairy men throughput
the coast who market their butter in San
Francisco and the commercial editors of the
San Francisco daily and weekly press, invit
ing their co-operation in accomplishing the
objects of the law and the standardizing of
packages, as set forth in this resolution.
A committee of three was appointed
to prepare a circular and in other ways
to communicate with all parties in in
terest. The houses that took part in
the meeting through their representa
tives were the following:
Dairymens' Union: Brlgham. Hoppe & Co.;
Wheaton. Pond & Harrold; F. B. Haight A
Co.; Luhrman, Martlnelll A Creon; John
Relmers; Scheer, Norhouse & Grandi; Oak

Ask for Reconsideration.
The attorneys for James Dunsmulr
asked the Supreme Court yesterday
for an order vacating the order deny
ing a writ to prohibit Judge Coffey
from executing his judgment in favor
of Edna Wallace Hopper and peti
tioning for leave to amend the orig
inal document. The court denied the
first petition last Wednesday.

SATURDAY APRIL 1, 1905
THE CASE STATED.
JGVU <M'l'V. Â{ the Federal Distric/ Court in Chicago,
in a recent decision, stated with great clearness the industrial
â¢iat may come from concentration. The Judge said:
matioii of the ownership of a country s industrial prop
on its people generally to a few of its people reaches the bed
and moral forces, in which alone the whole structure
.<" v. institutions rests; for. under such conditions, instead
if depending each on himself and his own intelligence chiefly for sue
great bulk of oar people increasingly will become dependents

on Â£Teat financial institutions, and those who possess nothing
for labor upon the great organizations of labor. lhat
ternalism ; paternalism almost in its final form; the paternalism
hal will eventually divide the country into two camps, the camp
and the camp of those who have not; the pater
liism thai speedily descends into state socialism or a dry rotted
nship as nerveless and as squalid as state socialism."
Thai is a stronplv stated warning which cries aloud to the Uw
ftkers to put in action the curbing force of law on lines that defend
idual enterprise and energy agfainst combined capital. The latter
trie its will independently and beneficially to the country in all
in which constructive and other operations are beyond the
icfa of individual resources, and are necessary for development, but
this must stop short of oppressing and destroying individual inde
â 
The President, it will be observed, draws the line where Judge
up draws it. The nation has thriven and grown great by
. -011 of the initiative of its people. They have had initiative be-
I 1 . reward that it brings. Deprive them of that incentive
there will be upon us at once/ the effects and the consequences
srtucti thinkers see in socialism and communism. Remove the per
sonal incentive, no matter by what means, and a stale and stagnant
i upon the people. It is better that the industrial operations
die country shall be in the hands of many rather than of the few,
that prices and wages br regulated by supply and demand, under
mpetition. Those were the conditions under which the coun
its commercial eminence, and they must be the conditions
â¢ier which it holds its conquest of the worlds trade.
Human interests cannot stand autocracy in business any more
lliati they eudure it in government. We are witnesses of the con
sequMcet of political autocracy in Russia, where the public treasury
iÂ« the private purse of the royal family, for whose members all others
- and tight and die. In a free state, free in a political
strial and -financial autocracy will be as little bearable and
bad. As its shadow rises, the socialist has one remedy â the con
ation p| all property. But the civic philosopher has the better
mcdy â the regulation by society of forces necessary to its exist
once, but which may become the agents of its destruction by closing
he door of opportunity.
Whatever it is better that the individual do leave to the indi

â¢ that W takes no step within the field where individual initiative
inspiration from the hope of reward.
â¢ tar industrial institutions are the product of the individual as
:). incentive, competition and initiative of the people. Their
oeratic usurpation by aggregations of capital will not occur. It
will be resisted exactly as the autocratic usurpation of our political
titutinor would be resisted. In the latter case no one would pro
se a descent into socialism as a remedy. The people would, by
invoking the orderly processes of the law and enforcing them phy
sically if need were, rescue their political institutions. They will do
the same in the case of their industrial institutions.
It is not among the possibilities of all the future that the people
of this republic shall surrender either their industrial or their civil
lefty, or that they shall seek to save either by a resort to the stifling
and ,-tagnating devices of communism.
FINANCING UNDER WAR STRESS.
JAPANS present methods of financiering under pressure of one
of the biggest wars, joined with a glance back into history's evi
dence as regards the often made assertion that the great bankers
of the world can prevent war when they wish, is an interesting study.
ha^ often proved true that the vanquished in a long fight learn
from their victors the power for future conquest out of the lessons
of defeat. So far Russia's military genius has gained nothing ap
parent in battlefield performance from her ample opportunities to
learn from her enemy's success ; but, judging from the semi-threat
ihe friends of Russia have recently intimated to the great bankers,
stye may be planning to profit by copying Japan's financial policy.
When the war began it was supposed by some financial experts
in Paris that the little empire could not raise the funds for a long
war. The facts seem to be against that theory. A notable feature ;
of Japans financiering methods is that ajthough she is negotiating 1
foreign loans with perfect ease at about 4 1-2 per cent, she is ar
ranging for much larger domestic loans at nearly double that interest. |
She i> probably calculating on two ways of benefiting I>\ this: first,
.that the bitf interest she pays will remain with her own people, and
â Â»nd. that this policy will make her independent of outside in
u-rterence and financial domination to force her into a peace that,
might be premature for her be* interests.
Whether Russia can succeed in profiting by an imitation of this
policy may be very uncertain, but that she intends to try seemsr
clear from the recent reply of her friends to the intimation from the
Paris bankers that no more Russian foreign loans could be placed ,
on the market unless Russia gave pledges of peace. The reply is \
that if Paris bankers won't take the loan some one else will; that i
Russia will make the loan at home ; that the Czar's Government will
not be coerced regarding peace by any foreign power or foreign
money market. '
This brings up the question of the power of the great bankers to
vtop war. Despite the often made assertion that in this way they
are the power behind the throne, history seems to show that they
arc not. Especially would it be difficult for them to force peace upon
a country conscious of its fighting capacities. For instance, bank- j
rupt Turkey fought Greece to a successful finish on the cool assur
ance that, although they had no money themselves, they were going
to get lots of it out of the Greek indemnity. The French revolution
ary campaigns were fought without the aid of international bankers; !
and a fine instance was the case of the Confederate States fighting !
four years on paper money. Its cotton loan was so small a drop
in the bucket of expense it need not be reckoned. History shows
ihat whenever a big power is bent on fighting it can always obtain
the funds.
THE COMING CAMPAIGN.
DISCLOSURES in city policies from day to day make clear the
fact that the manager? back of the Schmitz administration
have determined to take complete possession of every branch
of the city government and make use of it as a part of the political
machine through which they hope to achieve victory in the cominÂ°
election.
The evidence that has been brought out in the trial of the two
men convicted of frauds at the primaries has had no other effect
than that of increasing the activity of the men who were back of the
frauds. They will not undertake to run primaries again in that wav
perhaps, but they will r< thor means not niore scrupulous. In
the face of tlirse facts it becomes evident that the leaders of the
Republican party who desire that the party shall establish good gov
ment in San Francisco must begin at onc<- to consider what means
will best enable them to accomplish that end.
A disorganized, divided and badly led party will not be able to

WILL JIU-JITSU UNCLE SAM
'Congressman Hull is under the impression that Japan wh*n ehe gets through with
the Russian will turn and jiu-jitsu a fall out of Uncle Sam, and the Philippine Islands
will gf> to the little brown victors. A sad prospect indeed).
WHEN the little Japanese
Hunts the Russian from the seas.
Smashes up his small destroyers, his torpedo boats
and all â
Chops the White Czar's battleships
In the Baltic fleet to chips,
Hell turn around and out of Uncle Sammy take a fall-
Jiu-jitsu poor old Sammy in a very heavy tall.
When he licks the Slav again
On the co.d Manchurian plain,
Makes the line of forts round Harbin hardly -worth a "tinker's dam"j
When he throws his nut-brown ranks
Down on Russia's shattered flanks.
He will take some of the "sass," they say, quite out of Uncle Sam
Jiu-jitsu a lot of Yankee'bluff quite out of Uncle Sam.
When he cuffs the "Bear" about,
Flogs the Cossack with his knout,
Runs *he whiskered Romanoffsky, Peteroffsky from the ring
When he makes the last Russ "hike"
Up the Trans-Siberian pike.
Then to Uncle Sam this fighting fiend won't do a thingâ
With his jiu-jitsu to the U. S. he won't do a single thing.
When Vladivostok hears
The loud "banzais" â Japan's cheers â
Pealing through her ice-bound square and wintry streetâ
When he melts that city's snows,
AH her half-year bergs and floes,
He will warm our Sammy's jacket up a few degrees of heatâ
With his jiu-jitsu warm that jacket up a few degrees of heat.
When the Nippon bugle calls
Triumphant over Moscow's walls,
And the tramping of the island hordes are heard
On the frozen Neva's bank,
He will hurry back to yank
The last tail feather from the Yankee eagle bird-
Jiu-jitsu each tail feather from our grand old eagle bird.
When his battle thunders jar
Hard the sick bed of the Czar.
And the Northern Bear Is blinking in the sunburst of the Jap;
When the Kremlin's great bell tolls
For the peace of Russian souls,
He will don the gloves and take on Uncle Samuel for a scrap-
Take on Uncle Samuel for a little jiu-jitsu scrap.
When his awful siege gun booms
No more round the Manchu tombs,
And the fanner Chink is plowing up the bones of men who fell, I
When the din of conflict dies
Underneath the Asian skies,
He will be-a-working jiu-jitsu on our Uncle Sam-u-elâ
Just the jiu-jitsu of the Jappy on our Uncle Sam-u-el.
win against such a machine as has been built up by the managers of
the present administration. Many elements have been brought into
combination to support the existing system. They are so nu
merous that they can be beaten only by the most carefully planned
campaign on the part of the decent element of the party.
It therefore behooves the leaders of the Republican party and
also of the Democratic party to begin at once to prepare for a cam
paign which will give them a chance at least to win out in the pri
maries, and thus bring about the nomination of tickets so strong
that the corrupt elements back of the Schmitz machine will not be
able to prevail.

The Quarrel
KEITH GORDON
THERE were two aides of the
question, of course. There are
always two sides. He. being a
man, saw only the masculine
side, while she, being every inch
a woman, could see only the feminine
aspect of the matter that rose be
tween them like a wall.
According to his reasoning, the
great pearl that beamed softly on the
third finger of her left hand â his gift
â was the solemn, final expression of
his faith, his choice. It was the of
ficial seal affixed to his avowed* belief
that she was the supreme woman.
In his deeper, finer moments he
would relive the moment when he had
put it there, when the splendor of his
own destiny had sobered and steadied
him till his whole being had gone out
In the wordless prayer â "God grant
that I may make her happy."
From that moment she was the
fixed star of his life. Indeed, she
scarcely seemed to him a separate en
tity, but rather the finest part of him
self. And this was where the trouble
began. He was dashing and debonair
and the firiHament of his life was
strewn with stars of lesser magnitude,
mere plnheads beside her, but in the
aggregate by no means without inter
est and beauty. That they were fem
inine stars goes without saying, ana |
if there were moments when they
shone and twinkled for his especial
benefit, how could he do less than to
acknowledge the compliment?
To him it seemed no more than a
laughing by-play, the light, graceful
variation of the grand love theme or j
his life. But the Fixed Star saw it j
differentlyâ saw it with eyes that j
deepened and darkened with tragedy, i
which, after a few weeks -â¢ smolder
ing, burst into the flume of anger.
Never, perhaps, had she appeared
to him so Buperb, so obviously queen
of the world, as at that moment when
she had faced him, white with scorn, j
and accused him in plain, brutal, |
every-day English of being a flirt.
At first sheer amazement held him j
silent. But from the torrent of words ,
lhat rushed from her lips he was soon
in possession of the sum of his of
fenses. His attentions to Miss Lin
coln â his evident 1 enjoyment of the
! society of Mrs. Colin Stuart, not to
; mention Betty Pell and Lucia Armi-
I tage â !
As Van Pelt listened to the cut
ting words of his fiancee his first
amazement gradually congealed into
something else. He had paid some
attention to Miss Lincoln, who was a
visitor and friend of his sister. And
Mrs. Stuart had asked him for a din
ner or so, and as for Betty and Lucia,
he never missed a chance to join them.
Had they not been comrades since the
days when their nurses wheeled their
perambulators to the park side by
side?
And though he had frequently en
countered Flavia under these circum
stances, no hint of her possible dis
pleasure had ever occurred to him.
She â was she not the Only One â so
near, so much a part of himself that
there was no more need for explana
tion than there was to his own soul?
So, at these encounters, his eyes had
leaped to meet hers, without self
consciousness and without apology.
At first her confidence met his
nobly. Then little gnawing doubts
crept in. She would have liked him to
protest,' for, alas! she was but a
woman! And sometimes the high,
white place of his soul, where he kept
her enthroned, made her shiver and ;
long to be petted and scolded. And in
place of that he made her a goddess, i
supposedly with the power of reading
hearts.
"You haye â quite finished?"
His cool, drawling voice filled her
first pause with an icy suavity and the
steel of his eyes met the fire of hers !
unflinchingly. Involuntarily she caught
her breath. " He not only showed no
inclination to explain, to excuplate j
himself, but he had the look of a
man who has received a mortal
wound, whose deepest feelings have ;
been mercilessly scoffed at, jeered at, \
trampled in the mire.
At the words her heart turned to >
ice. Truth to tell, her outbursts had
nothing more serious than the quick
resentment of a warm-hearted, high- J
spirited woman at a fancied neglect"
I from the man she adored. A pair of ,
open arms and eyes that loved back, |
j begging for tolerance and forgiveness, i
that was what she wanted and ex- i
i pected. But this man, with the hard |
glance, and the incisive, cold voice â
j what had she done?
Despite her terror, the world old
battle between' pride and love was
raging in her heart and it was pride
that won.
"Finished?" she queried bitterly,
with an inflection that conveyed that
If she ceased it was by no means be
cause she had reached the end of the
I list. "We will call it so at least."
And with the wards she drew off the
ring and held it out to him. He re
ceived it with a low bow.
Obviously the episode was ended.
But at the door he turned back.
"When you have thought the matter
over more calmly you may possibly
have something to say to me. I give
I you one week to reconsider."
His mastery of himself, his unyield
ing resistance to her, thrilled her
through and through. Never had she
loved him so absolutely; but there was
no trace of her feeling in her mocking
reply.
"A week's grace! So good of you! '
I she laughed rather wildly. "And yet,
do you know, it is seven days more
than I shall need. I shall neverâ"
But he had gone. A moment later
she heard the street door close with
an ominous bang. She stood stupidly
in the middle of the room trying to
realize that there was no futureânoth
ing but a dreary waste that belied the j
name ahead o-f her. Then she looked
at her left hand, now so bare, so |
na^ced, no longer a hand consecrate, I
i but simply a woman's hand, shorn of
all its sweet significance, its badge of
dear dependence gone.
A clock struck the hour in silver |
tones, fetching her back to the dull I
present. Oh, yes, Mrs. Colin Stuart's
lea. She must go to that whatever
happenedâ she must go to everything
and be gayâ gayâ gay! Otherwise
people would say that she cared. He
might even think that she did. The
thought made her cheeks burn. And
gay she was, so gay indeed that more
than one of her friends turned long,
inquiring looks upon her, looks full of
puzzled questioning.
Once during the week of respite she
met him, but at his cold, impassive
greeting the little choking gladness
that the sight of him had brought, and
which for a fleeting second shook her
with Its expectancy, flickered out. He
had bowed with cold courtesy â and
j passed on.
But one thought stood out clearly in
the general confusion of her despair.
She must get away. Piteously she
realized that she must not run the risk
|of constant meetings. The Branhams
were sailing on Saturday. Why not
I go with them?
At the thought she started up. her
i blood whirling through her veins in the
old fashion. That would be tit fÂ«-r tat.
On her last day pf respite he should
see her name on the list of outgoing
passengers. Then perhaps he would re
s-ret tha.t he had passed her with noth

It was then that her eyes fell upon the

The Supervisors' joint Finance and
Utilities Committee yesterday appoint
ed Louis Mooser to make an appraise
ment of the blocks bounded by Fell,
Hayes and Franklin streets and Van
Ness avenue, which has been selected
as the site for the new public library.
Action was taken as the result of of
fers to sell pieces of land in the block
by various property owners, as fol
lows :
Eleanor Martin, 120x155 feet at north
west corner of Fell street and Van
Ness avenue, for $164,000; Mercantile
Trust Company, 120x110 feet at the
southwest corner of Hayes street and
j Van Ness avenue, for $110,000. Other
portions of the block are offered for
i sale by Michael Flood, trustee, for
! $90,000; Florence G. Perine and Jennie
G. McKlnlay. $76,000; George Fogel, for

| Charles Strohmayer, for $26,000; Mar
garet Feehan, for $3^,500; Mary Droger,
I for $32,500.
Assistant City Attorney John Cogh-
I lan stated that the offers cover
| the entire hlock except two lots on the
north side of Fell street owned by
Robert Inches and Ella M. Goff. Every
effort has been made to obtain offers
from the owners, but they have de
clined to fix any price at which they
will convey title to the city. The offer
of F. G. Perine is subject to a lease
held by H. J. McAvoy, that of George
Fogel to a lease held by J. P. Vignan
and that of Mary Droger to a lease

dren's playground was rejected, as the
lot is but half the size appraised and
desired.
Condemnation proceedings were or
dered brought for property offered by

his price of $4000 being considered too
high.
Louis Mooser was directed to re-

tension and to appraise the lot adjoin

The markets of the "world have been
searched to secure for this great store a
stock of sterling up-to-date spring goods
i that for size, variety and quality cannot
be excelled. Every dollar's worth is all
brand-new, which makes it an utter Im

PINERO BUSY
ON NEW PLAYS
English Writer at Work on
Two New Dramas, Already
Well on Way to Completion
GORKY'S LATEST EFFORT
Jim Corbett to Produce an
Adaptation of George Ber
nard Shawl Cashel Byron
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 31.â Arthur W.
Pinero has written one or two letters
to the newspapers recently to advocate
a British repertoire theater, but with
these exceptions nothing has been
heard from the dramatist since the
painful affair of "A Wife Without a
Smile." Pinero, however, has not
been sulking in his tent. He has been
hard at work on two new plays. Both
of them are now well advanced, though
as usual with Pinero, there is no tell
ing when either will be finished.
Of late the author of "Quex" haa let
the aristocracy severely alone. If one
remembers rightly there was not a sin
gle, titled person in "Iris." Letchmere
and his eister were almost the only
swells in "Letty." The characters in
"A Wife Without a Smile" were all of
the middle class, and so are those in
the more important of Pinero's two
new plays.
It is possible that the drama which
Maxim Gorky wrote, or rather com
pleted, in the fortress of Peter and
Paul will never be staged, but an in
teresting account of it has just been
published in the St. Petersburg "No
vosti." The play tells of two friends,
one of them a scientist and the other
an artist, who dwell in the upper part
of a house, while below them, in the
basement, a working class family re
sides. The savant is absorbed in his
experiments, studying how to create a
"homunculus," and the artist has been
working for years at a picture with
which he wishes to astonish the whole
world.
The workmen spend their whole life
in toil, varied by bouts of drunkenness
and abuse of the dwellers on the upper
floor. In a word, th*ey live no better
than savages. The moral of the work
is that the two elements of Russian so
ciety can never come to an understand
ing while there exists between them
such a terrific diff rence in education
and conditions of life.
FARCE BY STERNER.
Lawrence Sterner, the author of a
lively three-act farce juGt put on at
the Strand Theater with every prom
ise of success. a younger brother of
that brilliant American artist, Albert
Sterner, whose illustrations for Mrs.
Humphrey card's new novel are at
tracting attention here as well as in ttve
United States. The elder Sterner haa
lately left London with his wife and
son and infant daughter, for a pro
longed stay in Munich. The younger
Sterner, the playwright, is nt/w living
tn London vrjth his mother.
London's boom in Shakespeare con
tinues unabated. Lewis Waller, whose
production of "Henry V " has been a
complete success, Is getting ready to
put un "Romeo and Juliet," with Eve
lyn Millald as the daughter of tbe Cap
ulets. Miss Tita Brand, who is a great
favorite in the province*, but rather
lets well known in London, will reopen
the Shaftesbury with a revival of
"Othello." Beerbohm Tree will follow
his present production of "Much Ado
About Nothing" with revivals of
"Julius Caesar," "Richard II" and "A
Midsummer Night's Dream," and will
also play "Hamlet." In fact London
is to have no' less than three "Ham
lets" all at once, the other two being
Martin Harvey, who recently appeared
as the Dane In Dublin, and H. B. Irv
â¢ ing, w"hose intention of essaying the
role so intimately associated with his
father, was announced some time ago.
CORBETTS LATEST ROLE.
The news that James J. Corbett is
planning to produce an adaptation of
"Cashel Byron's Profession" has been
received with calmness by George Ber
nard Shaw.
"No," he said yesterday, "I have not
collaborated with Mr. Corbett in any
way. Do I think it odd that a prize
fighter should produce a play by me?
Not at all. Why should I? It seems
to me Mr. Corbett is a person of su
perior attainments.
"Of course I've written" a play from
'Cashel Byron's Profession. 1 I wrote
it here to protect my rights. It's a
very fine play. I wrote it in Shakes
pearean blank verse as I had to hurry
over it and hadn't time to write it In
the usual prose. But about Mr. Cor
bett. I don't see reasons why he should
riot succeed either as an adaptor or an
actor. He is a man who has made a
success in one profession and will,
therefore, understand that there are
difficulties to be encountered in making
a success in another. Of course Cashel
Byron is a prizefighter, and there's a
good fight in the book, and people al
ways like to see a fight."

SPORTS
EXCITING SPORT
IS EXPECTED.
The law's restraining hand will be removed from the trout
streams of the State to-day, and an army of enthusiastic
anglers will whip the waters for the finny treasures. There
svifl be no fly-fishing, which is the highest development of
the gentle sport, owing to the high water in the streams
and to other unfavorable conditions.
Fly Fishing Will Be Impossible
Under Present Conditions.
An army of enthusiastic anglers will
avail themselves cf the opportunity
wetting a line to-day on
some one of the streams within
reach of this city to mark
th* opening of the trout season. Paper
< 'reek in Marin County, which is
unced the most wonderful trout
t-tream in all the world, will be dotted
vith anglers throughout its entire
h. It always yield? good returns
xm opening day. as nature restocks it
season from her inexhaustible
house, the ocean.
Point Reyes will be the objective
point of many anglers, as the biggest
baskets come from there. Any one
knowing the stream is sure of success.
The mistake the inexperienced anglers
make, according to the veteran?, is to
race one another along the stream,
thuÃ scaring the fish, which refuse to
ttrike at the most tempting bait. Sal
nior. roe and the familiar barnyard
hackle will be the lines used almost
'â¢xelusivt -ly.
Among the well-known anglers who
v ill be on the Paper Mill are:
Sam Wells. Jabez Swan. James Lynch. Chas.
BrÂ«>idensteln, Itaisch Terry. Frank Marcus,
JchÃ Butler. E. J. Kaplan. Bert Spring. Frank

â¢he San Mateo County water? the
and San Gregorio are good
iaw for bait fishing. Sonoma

the Paper Mill in popularity with th'
angler*. It also is easy of access and
I i Ids good returns.
Alameda Creek, near Sunol, la also
a favorite stream early In the season.
San Pedro Creek, on the coast, about
miles below Colma, usually af
f<>rds good sport under conditions as
they exi^t at present.
Austin C r Cazadero, always
attracts a number of anglers.
Up to within a few days the reports
from the Klamath were to the effect
thru the river was fairly low and that
there *VM but little snow on the moun-
It is possible the recent storm
t hanged these conditions. The Truckee
if muddy and will not be good until
June 1, according to all accounts. The
Sacramento is also high.
C. A. Reed, the Santa Cruz Game
Warden, who guards the streams of
that county closely, reports th-? pros
pecta for bait fishing as being good.
The streams are unusually high, but
a tour of the various fishing
ea he expresses confidence that
rare sport is in store for the anglers.
During the last two weeks there has
h large run of steelheads, weigh
ing from two to five pounds, in the
< oast streams. The run is especially
large in Scott and in Waddell creeks,
ding that of any season for the
â  â¢ ars. As the creeks are high
it is not expected the fish will return
c oiean before the 15th or the
20th inst.
-ndid sport is expected in Boul
der Creek, as the steelheads have been
going up the San Lorenzo River in
large numbers during the past few
days. They will scale from one to six
pounds and are in fine condition.
The fishing on Soquel Creek will be
lie fish have been held below
th' Paper Mill dam for the hatrhery.
the dam down to Capitola the
fishing should be excellent.
Oood fishing should be had on Los
Gatos Creek, from one-half mile to five
miles from the railroad station.
As mail If all the ftrfams have con
siderable drift in them the anglers
must be prepared with a plentiful sup
ply of tack-f.

WILL LINE UP
First of Annual Matches
Between California and
Stanford to Be Played
BERKELEY, March 31. â The first
intercollegiate baseball game of the
season will be played to-morrow after
noon between California and Stanford
on the California campus. The blue
and gold men are in perfect condition,
confident of victory, expecting to take
not only the first game of the series,
but all of the three contests. Cali
fornia has a team of veterans, eight of
whom have played together for the
last two years. Trainer Walter Christie
last night gave out the names of the
players who have made the varsity.
The teams will line up:
California â Position. Stanford â
Heltmuller Pitcher Sales
Bliss Catcher Btott
Graham First Base Presley
Glllle Second Base Bell
Gunn Third Base Fenton
C ausley Shortstop Trowbridge
(Captain)
Ptrub Right Field Dudley
Jordan Left Field Lewis
Sweery Center Field Colbert.
Only one accident has happened
during all the preliminary work. Strub
having broken a finger early in the
season. Christie says: "I look for a
blue and gold victory if the men play
as well behind Heitmuller against
Stanford as they have been doing for
two months."
Coach McCarthy says: "I am satis
fied with the showing the players have
made. The infield is like a stone wall.
In the outfield Strub. Sweezy and Jor
dan are covering lots of .territory. In
the last few weeks there has been a
noticeable improvement in the batting
of the players. If Heitmuller pitches
anywhere near his form of the pre
liminary game the team should win."
The university rifle team is to meet
the veterans of the National Guard at
Shell Mound to-morrow in the first of
a series of match shoots. Two other
challenges have been accepted, one
from the San Quentin guards and one
from Company D, Fifth Regiment,
National Guard of California. The
university rifle team to-morrow will
include the following men:
S. E. Montgomery. '06; A. C. Thode, '06;
R. I. Turner, '00; W. I. Robertson, '06; R. H.
Harding. 'Ots; H. G. McKannay. '07; R. S.

EeÂ«e. '06.
The upper half semi-finals of the
try-outs among the tennis players to
determine who shall represent Cali
fornia in the tennis tournament with
Stanford will be played to-morrow
morning. The finals will be played in
the afternoon. At the conclusion of
the try-outs those who are entitled to
a chance for second place will begin
their tournament. The women of the
university are playing off their tourna
ment to decide who will represent Cali
fornia against Stanford. The women
are to play Stanford in the same pro
portion as the men, with two singles
and one double team as representa
tives.
A track meet with the University of
Washington has been decided upon by

CARDINAL) PLAYERS READY.
Stanford Men Are Anxious to Take the
First Game.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
31,â Stanford will meet the University
of California to-morrow in the first
intercollegiate athletic contest of the
year. The event will be the opening
baseball game of the championship
series and it is to be played on the
Berkeley field. The student fans at
Stanford are anxious for the cardinal
to win the first game, as they realize
that in college baseball the team
which pulls out ahead in this scrim
mage is usually the final winner. With
this idea in mind they will send a
great delegation of lusty-lunged root
ers to support their nine.
Just what the cardinal baseball
team will be able to do against the
California players is a matter of
doubt. The preliminary games have
not served to show the superiority of
either team. Both have defeated and
been defeated by Santa Clara College,
St. Mary's and San Francisco club
teams. In these contests the univer
sities have tried out so many players
â at times enough men to make two
teams have been used on each side â
that it has befcn impossible to get a
good estimate of their strength. Not
until the last two weeks have the
coaches been able to pick the men
who will play in the final intercolle
giate match, and during that time
there have been few games.
Stanford Is this year strong in the
box. Sales has profited much by the
experience he gained last year and
he has at last succeeded in obtaining
nearly perfect control. His high, fast
s-hoots will prove bothersome to the
Berkeley sluggers. It is, in fact, on
Sales that Stanford places her fond
est hopes .of victory.
Hitting is, of course, the weak spot
in the cardinal team. There is not a
premier batsman in the lot. Coach
Cowden, however, by hours of con
stant practice each day, has succeed
ed In getting the men to meet the ball.
There are no players who will strike
out continually.
The fielding ability of the Stanford
nine this year is all that could be de
sired. The men play so well together
that they are able to get away with
a good many fast plays. So far this
year they have successfully controlled
any tendency to "go up in the air"
at critical stages.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 1, 1905.
RAISE BRIDGE
AT BELVEDERE
Corinthians to Tow a Few
Craft From Lagoon Into
Open Waters of the Cove
At 10 o'clock to-morrow morning
the first sign of the approaching
opening of the yachting season of
190f> will be seen. At that hour the
bridge over the entrance to the la
goon at Tiburon will be raised to per
mit the yachts that have been lying
in the lagoon during the winter to be
towed out. The newly constructed
bulkhead has made the current that
runs into and out of the lagoon so
strong that boats can be taken out
safely during a short period only.
During the past winter so many of
the yachts were laid up in Corte Ma
dera Creek, Stone's yard and other
places that not more than four or
five will have to be towed out. The
building of the new bridge on the
road to Belvedere has diminished the
value of the lagoon as a winter har
bor so greatly that it is possible the
Supervisors may be asked to tear out
the bulkhead.
The San Francisco and Corinthian
Yacht clubs have held their annual
yacht-owners' meetings and have
prepared their schedules of events for
the coming season. The members of
the California Yacht Club held a
meeting during the week to talk over
the coming season and to decide what
shall be done with regard to build
ing quarters on the platform already
constructed near the bay end of the
Key Route pier.
Julius E. Back of the Corinthian
Yacht Club has sold the sloop Cather
ine, formerly owned by Sutherland
Brothers of Sausalito and a contestant
for the Perpetual Challenge Cup as
the representative of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club, to Charles Triebel
and O. H. Robertson. Both the new
owners are graduates of the State
University, Charles Triebel being a
chemist at the Mare Island navy yard.
The sloop will be enrolled with the
Corinthian and Vallejo clubs and will
have moorings both off Mare Island
and in Tiburon Cove. Julius E. Back
I made the ocean cruise from Sausa
| lito to San Pedro last year in the
1 sloop Nellie, in company with Dr. T.
L. Hill, Vice Commodore H. H. Jen
ness and others. He will probably go
to the Eastern States for a year and
may pick up a yacht at one of the
harbors there.
S B. Stevenson's fin-keel sloop
Neva Is to be raffled. The Neva is
32 feet over all, with a length of 19
feet 8 inches on the water line, a
beam of 9 feet 6 inches, a draught of
4 feet 8 inches, and a racing length
of 21.90 feet.' She has a cabin ac
commodating four persons. She was
built in 1008 and has shown great
speed, having taken first prize in the
25-foot class in the annual regatta of
the Corinthian Yacht J3lub.

The pick of the greyhounds in train

morrow on the Union Coursing Park
field. Only fifty-six entries were ac
cepted, the scarcity of hares still being
a difficult problem for the promoters to
solve.
Among the new performers will be
Harlean Rags, owned by D. K. Cartter
of Cottonwood Falls, Kans. He weighs
fifty-nine pounds and is by Hopeful-
Countess Eve, she by For Freedom. He
is credited with a great turn of speed.

he says can lead his entire string.
Dr. F. P. Clark of Stockton, who won
the stake last week with Mr. Zignego,
will try to repeat the performance to
morrow.
As soon as the hare famine is at an
end as many dogs will be accepted as
can be coursed in two days. The likely

began his yachting on the river
Clyde in his native Scotland, and for
some time sailed with Dr. T. L. Hill
in the sloop Grade. For a season or
two he owned the sloop Will o f the

Curlew (formerly Dr. T. L. Hill's Cyg

by the yachtsmen here, but will, no
doubt, find out a good deal about the
tides and currents of Puget Sound
during the coming season.

ever before on this coast. The tour

centers are the Indoor events which

It is probable the semi-finals in both
singles and doubles will be played
next Wednesday and Saturday nights.
The finals and an exhibition match
will be played during the following
week. The exhibition match will be
a doubles, in which the Hardy broth
ers, Percy Murdock and Grant Smith
will participate.
Two tournaments are scheduled for
to-morrow, a handicap doubles at the
park and a class singles at the Cal
ifornia Club. The latter event will
be for second and fourth class play
ers. Those who are eligible are S. H.
Adams, C. J. Smith, R. B. Cornell.
Ray Splivalo, A. Chesebrough, B.
Nourse, Sidney Salisbury and Dv Val
Moore in the second class. The fol
lowing have been put in the fourth
class: Judge Troutt, Lund. H. Sulli
van. Dr. Noble, B. Ivancovich, H.
Spring, W. Murphy, C. N. Ravlin, H.
McAfee, E. Robbins, W. Johnson, W.
Koehler and G. Lisser.
The players will compete for the
cups recently donated by the direc
tors. They must be won three times.
The trophies which will be com
peted for on the park courts have
been up for three years. The Baker
brothers comprise the only team that
has won them twice. They will be in
the competition on Sunday and will
do their best to secure the third and
final victory.
Another team that will make a
strong bid for first honors is made up
of George Janes and Herbert Long.
They are the cup holders. Their vic
tory over the Baker brothers on Sun
day will probably result in their be
ing placed on the same mark with
the leaders.

In the shortest space- of time the better

there ell the time. Yesterday's game
was I Ding-bine affair when the Seals
pot 'under way. â Ban Francisco
11. Seattle 3.
It was a queer finish after the.way j
ii started. The SI washes began to play j
big league baseball for a while, and up !
to the fourth Inning they had the na- â¢
tives snowballed, 3 to 0. They were :
pulling off hits and run plays., eating i
up every hard chance that skimmed on ]
the grass and . doing several other '
etunts that win ball games. , " . .-,".
The Seals managed to shove one man
over la the fourth.' and the home fans I
felt a little better. It remained for the
next epasm to bring forth the spectacu
lar event of the occasion. This came In
the form of seven runs. They were
coming over so fast that the crowd
wondered whether the Seattle layout
was trying to kid them or not.
"Flash" Nealon was the main squeeze
in the batting fest- With Irwln and
Hilde oh the bags the kid from the
.bushes swung on one that went. to the"
score board. These hits are generally
good" for two bags In this league, but
Joseph made his go for three. He
sprinted on those sacks like one of t
Pa colts on the short end, and pulled. 1
up at third many feet ahead of the ball.
The San Francisco layout liked the
-.ranee of Mr. Shields' benders. ,
There was no one who could not bing ,
him once in a while. Busher Spencer
glaumed three, as did ex-Captain . Ir
vvin. Wheeler landed for a double and
.a single. Those who did. not feel like
swinging waited and were rewarded
with bases on balls, for Shields could
not see the plate well during the thick
of the fight.
Seattle does not play together. It
will take a lot of work and a lot of
lime to get the team ready. The play
ers do well at times, but when the op
posing team begins to souse. the ball
and set men on the bases it is gener

Thomas Refuses to Let
Commuters Hit.
OAKLAND. March 31.â Manager
Captain George Van Haltren'E ex-Loh
manites were eaten alive in the Idora
Park jungle to-day by the Tacoma
Tigers. Score, 6 to 2.
Thirteen hits were plucked by Fish
er's Bengals from the contributions
passed up to the plate by Southwinger
Oscar Graham. Five of these were
two-sackers and four of them were
manufactured in the fifth inning, Mc-
Laughlin, Thomas. Doyle and Sheehan
being the sluggers to wield the big
stick that netted their team three runs.
Tacoma chalked up one tally in the
opening half of the initial inning. The
Oaklanders went the northern men one
better in their half, ringing the bell
twice. That was the only inning in
which the gong sounded for the cohorts
of the deposed Peter. Tacoma added
one run v. ite column in the seventh
and another in the eighth inning.
Thomas was miserly with hits after
the first inning and kept them scat
tered go that the bingles did not re
dound to the advantage of Oakland.
I Umpire Kiopf displayed the power
vested in him in the third inning by I
calling Kelly out *on a foul that was !
i knocked high into the air near the
I Oakland players' bench and which i
; Hogan failed to catch. The Tacoma
' backstop claimed Francks jumped from
' the players' bench and balked him in
\ his effort to catch the. pellet. Klopf
gave, judgment in favor of Hogan and
1 Kelly went back to the bench.
Sheehan drove a cannon ball ' past.
Devereaux in the fifth that prostrated
Barbarian Bill with '- its smoke 'and
brought up in left field full against
: Dunlevy"6 teeth. Dunlevy retired to
. recuperate and Cook, the general util
ity man for Veteran" Van Haltren, was
detailed in the left plat. Cook dropped
1 the only fly hit to him and at the bat
j failed to win any plaudits. â 
Tommy Sheehan was bombarded on
both legs in the ninth inning by Gra
ham, who shot the sphere at the little
third baseman. It took a zigzag course
and confused Sheehan into ducking the
; wrong way. The attendance was small,
, but a larger assemblage is looked for
j to-morrow. The score:

PETERS \VAT< HDOG DESERTS
AND THE HOODLUMS
Potrero Man Who Buys Canine to
Protect Him is Treed by the
Faithless Animal.
Peter Wverling of Alabama and
Twenty-eighth streets had an afflic
tion somewhat similar to that of
Peter Peter, the pumpkin-eater of
Mother Goose fame. The affliction of
the pumpkin-eaier is more common
than that of Wverling, who bought a
canine from the pound to protect him
from a gang of hoodlums. He had a
hard time raising the price, too. He
wanted a dog with sound teeth and
leather lungs. He grot one of uncer
tain ancestry, but decided viciousness.
' I had to borrow two dollars to get
him," announced Peter, "but he is
worth it. Come on, Ixmie."
The dog- went with him as far as
the corner. Then a gang of Wver
ling's persecutors hove in sight and
began to assail him with mud clods.
"Sic 'em, Louie." ordered Wverling,
and loosened his purchase. Louie
sprang for the nearest persecutor and
Wverling hid his eyes, not wanting to
see the ela'<rhter. When he opened
them he Â«aw the fickle beast wagging
his tail and trying to lick the hood
lum's face. The hoodlum pointed to
Wverling. "Sic him," he ordered.
The dog started for Wverling, and
he meant business. Wverling climbed
a barber pole and did stunts that
would shame a monkey-on-a-stick
until a policeman arrived.
For several nights Wverlinp haunt
ed the corner of Alabama and Twen
ty-eighth streets whistling and calling
plaintively for Louie. Yesterday he
applied to the pound for a restoration
of the money he paid for the faith
less canine. He was told to whistle
for it. He is still whistling.

DAMAGE SUIT IS MET
BY' A UNIQUE DEIEXSF
Claim Made That Operation â *! Slot
Machines Makes Gnmiug Estab
lishment of Cigar Store.
Attorney Henry Ach made a unique
argument yesterday before Judge
Troutt In support of a demurrer he
has interposed on behalf of the Ha
vana Commercial Company to the suit
filed against it by S. Cahen. keeper
of a cigar store at 22 Montgomery
street. Cahen asks Judgment against
the comrrtercial company for $25,000
damages, claiming that the commer
cial company has injured his business
to that extent by causing the report to
be circulated that the plaintiff is deal
ing in an inferior brand of cigars un
der the pretense that they are an im
ported brand of which the defendant
company is agent.
Ach, on behalf of the commercial
company, argued yesterday that Ca
hen has no business to injure; that he
is operating slot machines at his place
contrary to section 330 of the Penal
Code, and that in conseauence his
I>la> c is naught but a gambling estab
lishment and. not entitled to the pro
tection of ihe law. Judge Troutt mast
determine whether or not a slot ma
chine is a gambling device and if so
if the operation of the same by Ca
hen makes his establishment an il
legal one and entitled to no protec
tion. The demurrer Is now under ad
visement.
CALIFORNIA LEMON MEN'
HEAR OF THE SICILY CROP
Commercial Museum Receives Of
ficial Advices That Promise Well
for This State.
The Pacific Commercial Museum
having received inquiries from promi
nent lemon growers of California for
information as to the extent of dam
age to lemon crops in Sicily, Is now in
receipt of telegraphic advices from
Washington. D. C, indicating that the
poor condition of the foreign market
should prove of great value to the
growers of this State.
The report comes from United
States Consul Caughy at Messina to
the effect that the outlook for the
spring crop la not jÂ»romising. as se
vere hail storms In January and Feb
ruary extensively damaged the blos
soms and the crop in consequence is
estimated as being not over half of
that of last year.
On the Messina market there are
only 90.000 boxes of the November
cut of lemons, the greater portion of
which will be sent to Russia under
the existing contracts, while the re
mainder will be shipped to Montreal,
of the recently cut fruit, there are
only on hand 15.000 boxes at Mesina.
the* fruit being of such poor quality
that no orders have been placed from
America.
TELLS STORIES OF WILD
ANIMALS HE HAS KNOWN
Lecturer Shows Tliat the Buffalo Is
Multiplying in Certain Parts of
the Country.
Ernest Seton Thompson delivered
two entertaining lectures yesterday af
ternoon and evening at Lyric Hall. The
famous student of animal life de
scribed during his afternoon talk the
habits of small quadrupeds and also
gave an interesting description of the
great Manitoba country and the deni
zens of Its forests and mountains.
In the evening the speaker's subject
was "Wild Animals at Home." In his
opinion a great crime is being com
mitted by the ruthless slaughter of the
inhabitants of the woods. He believes
that the protection afforded the buf
falo has resulted in a material in
crease of the herds.
At 11 o'clock this morning Thomp
son will speak on "The Indian as I
Know Him; this afternoon at 2:30 his
subject will be "The Personality of
Wild Animals" and this evening at
8:15 "New Adventures of Animal
Friends."
Row Over a Drug Store.
Igmatz Beck has filed answer to the
complaint of Dr. S. Zussman. in which
the doctor asks that Beck be com
pelled to render an accounting: of the
affairs of the drug store at 1348 Ellis
street, the right to the possession of
which both claim. Beck gays that
while it 1h true that Dr. Zussman was
the original owner of the store, he
surrendered his lease in July of 1894
and moved out his stock. Beck, who
had been employed by him as a clerk,
alleges that after Dr. Zussman aban
doned the place he took the lease and
put in a stock of drugs at an expense
of $3000, borrowing money nnd re
ceiving credit in order to do this.
Zussman, he says, has absolutely no
interest in the store as it now stands
and he asks that Dr. Zussman's peti
tion for the appointment of a receiver
"be denied and that the court decree
that the title to the establishment vest
in him alorie.

The market seemed a nervous on<Â» !
from the start, the layers evidently !
fearing (.'igarlighter was tfoing to start !
; with the unngured percentage. San j
Nichtlas finally closed favorite at 3
:to 5. with Misty's Pride, the top j
weight, next in demand. An early j
I rush forced the price about Prince j
Brutus from 10 to â¢", but later 9 could i
be had. Misty's Pride ran a most pc- I
culiar raci.-. For about three-eighths of !
a mile she raced out in the lead with j
Prince Brutus, and then began fading j
away.
San Nicholas could not overtake !
Princp Brutus, but Cigarlighter closed |
i strongly under McÃride's urging, just. ;
falling short a neck at the wire. San j
Nicholas flnishod third, a length be- I
fore Misty's Pride. The decided im- j
provement displayed by Prince Brutus* I
and the Inexplicably bad showing of j
Misty's Pride were the features of the '
hand'eap.
LONG SHOT FINISHES FIRST.
Morita, a 20 to 1 Bhot, enlivened pro
ceedings by taking the opening event, I
after which four favorites landed in i
front. The track will again be light
ning fast by this afternoon.
As a rule the debut of Double Six is ;
attended with success, but not so this j
season. Jack Follansbee's mare went ,
to the post a 3 to 5 chance for the in- j
troductory sprint and was beaten a ;
length by Morita, the Napa Stock Farm '<
entry and 20 to 1 in the betting. Royal j
Rogue held a slight advantage over the I
favorite to the paddock, where he had '
enough. Sammy Greenfield on Double I
Six now thought he had the race won, !
when little Taylor astride the outsider
came with a rush on the outside, scor
ing by a length. F. E. Shaw showed a
bit of early speed.
Dr. Rowell's Best Man is a virtuoso
when it comes to handling weight. In
the five and a half furlong run the big \
gelding picked up 137 pounds and, well
ridden by Travers, overhauled fhe '
pacemaker, Edinborough, winning by a !
neck. Redan took the show from Toto I
Gratlot by a head. The winner ruled ;
an odds-on favorite.
Cinnabar, piloted by Lloyd Fountain >
and an 11 to 5 favorite in the ring, cap- !
tured the mile and a quarter sellfng af- |
fair. It was a lucky win, for Expedient I
should have had the purse.
BARNEY DREYFUSS LEADS.
Barney Dreyfuss cut out the running
for something more than a mile, when i
the favorite took command. Wright did
not use his whip on Expedient until
well Into the stretch, lasti the wire
only lost by a neck. Plying Torpedo
had some early speed, which he failed,
however, to carry far.
Minder should confine his riding to
horses quoted at long odds, for he has
no success piloting well-played ones.

fair he had the mount on Harry Beck,
and the gelding made a disgraceful
showing. The betting, too, wore an
I indifferent phase. A big play forced
j the odds about Beck from 5 down to 4,
i but later on 5 and a meal ticket were
on tap. His running Justified this
generosity. The price against Hugh
McGowan opened at 6 to 5, reached
2^ and was then hammered down to
8 to 5. Travers on the latter made all
the running, and with some shaking
up the Rowell entry disposed of Sin
cerity Belle by a couple of lengths.
Esherin ran a moderate third.
The presence of Gold Enamel In the
tive and a half furlong purea run
caused many owners to resort to the
scratching blank. The Miller colt went
to the post on odds on cTiolce and led
Ethel Barrymore across the line half
a dozen lengths. The latter fllly, to
gether with Smithy Kane, set a merry
clip and both tired ac the wire was
approached. Fountain made a fumble
at the end, costing Smithy Kane the
place.
TRACK NOTES.
Travers and Lloyd Fountain divided
the saddle honors, each riding two
winners.

mile race to be run one week from to

MRS. BROWN CAPTURES
THE COUNCIL'S GOLF CUP
Having Won Two Previous Competi-
tions. She Acquires Permanent
Possession of Trophy.
In the final round of the competi
tion for the Council's cup for women
that began on Tuesday on the course
of the San Francisco Golf and Coun
try Club, Mrs. R. Gilman Brown beat
Mrs. J. R. Clark, 6 up 4 to go, and
captured the handsome silver loving
cup as her permanent possession. The
contest was an unusually interesting
one, as each of the players had won
two previous competitions. Mrs. W.
G. Miller had also two victories to her
credit, but was beaten by Mrs. J. H.
Clark in the semi-final round.
When the next golf season opens the
council of the Fan Francisco Golf and
Country Club will have to provide a
new trophy for the Women's Annex.
Two Council's cups have been pre
sented by the directors to the women
players and both now adorn Mrs. R. G.
Brown's sideboard.

TRADE RETURNS
ARE FAVORABLE
NEW YORK, March 31.â R. G. Dun
& Co.'s Weekly Review of Trade to
morrow will say:
Trade returns are increasingly sat
isfactory, continued high temperature
accelerating distribution in all leading
lines. The closing days of March
brought greater confidence regarding
the future and results for the first
quarter of 1905 proved even more favor
able than was anticipated when the
year opened. Sanguine expectation of
manufacturers who made extensive
preparations are now being realized.
Freight congestion has followed the
heavy shipments of spring merchan
dise and railway earnings in three
weeks of March T /ere 8.2 per cent
larger than in 1904.
Immigration continues to surpass all
records and international markets im
prove as the conclusion of the war
seems imminent. Foreign commerce at
this port for last week showed a gain
of $2,404,617 on imports and Â» decrease
of $817,924 in exports as compared with
1904.
Mild weather improves the quality
of hides and especially from the South
west, and tbe tone of the market is
decidedly firmer.
More inquiries are received from
china, but there is little prospect that
desired deliveries can be made, as some
lines are under order up to next Feb
ruary.
Failures this week numbered 244 in
the United States, against 208 last year,
and 33 in Canada, compared with 16 a
year ago.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
Excellent weather, favorable grairt
crop reports, expansion In industry,
well-maintained spring trade, particu
larly in the West, enlarging retail trade
in the leading cities and unimpaired
confidence in the future are a sextet
of conspicuously satisfactory features
demanding notice this week.
Special reports to Bradstreet's from
all leading winter and spring wheat
sections point to the winter-sown crop
having stood the cold weather in
excellent condition.
Special reports from 108 cities and
towns of the United States point to an
expenditure for houses, offices, factories
and other edifices of $455,000,000 during
the present calendar year. Allowances
for cities not yet reported, would indi
cate that the total expenditures for
edifices for this year would run well
up to $600,000,000. In addition to this
marked activity in railroad building
and heavy orders for equipment fore
shadow an expenditure of probably
$200,000,000 by the railroads, this all
pointing to an aggregate expenditure
for material and labor of close to $800.
000.000.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending March 30 number
225, against 204 last week. 212 in the
like week In 1904. 145 in 1903. 178 in 1902
and ISB in 1901. In Canada failures for
the week ending March 30 number 29.
against 18 last week and 11 in this
v/eek a year ago.
Wheat. Including flour, exports for
the week ending March 30 are 98*. 630
bushels, against 1.044.595 bushels last

EXTENSION OF MARKET
STREET IS PROJECTED
Commissioner Algeltinger Makes In
spection of Easy Grade to
CorbetC Avenue.
Commissioner of Works AigeltingÂ«r
yesterday went on a tour of inspection
for the purpose of securing an easy
grade for the continuation of Market
street, from Seventeenth street to Cor
bett avenue and. Ashbury street. AiÂ£Â«l
tinger acted at the request of the Su
pervisors' Finance Committee, v* hich
has under consideration the appropria
tion of funds for the opening of Mar
ket street. Aigeltinger believes that
the extension could be made by easy
stages and will report the result of Da
observations to the committee. Some
property will have to t>e condemned Â«o
<arry out the improvefment.
The Board of Works proposes to re
pave Division street, between King
and Eighth, with the old basalt blocks
taken up from Fourth street. A tem
porary driveway forty feet wid*
be constructed, as the street must be
sewered when funds are available.
Complaints bavins been made by
property-owners that the dirt ani
debr,is accumulating after side sewers
are built have not been removed.
Aigeltinger has hired private teams to
clean the streets complained of.
The Drayman's Association has in
dorsed the plan to build a roadway on
Channel street, between Fourth and
Fifth, and Aigletlnger has not despair
ed of his hope that the Harbor â¢
missioners will lend their aid to the
project.

WIFE ACCUSES
HUSBAND'S SONS
Hamilton W. Gray, owner of a farm
near Fresno, lots in Marln and gold in
bank, who resides at 1611 Polk street,
has been enticed away from his young
wife, Olga G. Gray, by his two sons
by a former marriage, A. William and
H. H. Gray, according to a complaint
filed by her yesterday for maintenance.
The object of the sons, Mrs. Gray al
leges, is to secure possession of their
fathers property and deny her the
pleasure of her husband's company, the
right of his support and the hope uf
his bequest.
In her complaint for maintenance
she names her husband, his two sons,
the Bank of California and the Cali
fornia Safe Deposit and Trust Com
pany as defendants. The banks are
joined in the case on the claim that
their vaults hold some of the wealth
of defendant Gray, said to aggregate
about $50,000.
Mis Gray says she was married to
Gray on August 14, 1903, and on May
3, 1904, enticed by his two sons, he
abandoned her. He remained away,
she says, until November 1 of that
year, when he returned, and she again
received him as her husband. But the
sons again brought their influence to
bear, she says, and again he deserted
her and has since refused to return to
her and has failed to maintain her.
Since then, she further alleges, the sons
hav<^ used every endeavor to get their
l'atht-r to place his property in, their
hands, that her rights to even her
share of the community property may
be defeated. â¢
She asks that the court award her
permanent alimony in the sum of $100
a n:onth and $250 counsel fees and that
the sons and the banks be restrained
from disposing of any of the properties
of the defendant that may have come
into their possession since she was de
serted by her husband.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, ; SATURDAY, APRIL 1, 1005
STRANGER GETS
HUNTER'S COIN
John Hunter, a wealthy business
man of New Zealand, who has been
a guest at the California Hotel for
several days, has met the cunning:
American bunko man and as a result
he now mourns the loss of $80 in coin
and certificates of exchange amount
ing to $1000. Yesterday Hunter, who
arrived here on the steamship Sono â¢
ma last Tuesday from the colonies,
woefully related his experiences of the
previous night to the management of
the California Hotel and showed his
empty wallet as proof of the declara
tion that he had been robbed.
He told of how hÂ« had met a
stranger on the street the previous
evening, of how the fellow had ac
costed him in a familiar manner,
called him by name, referred to in
timate friends at home in New Zea
land, and finally induced him to take
a walk. Hunter, at first suspicious of
his new acquaintance, was finally per
suaded to believe that the latter had
known him in New Zealand and read
ily discussed with his Companion mat
ters in which both seemed interested.
From this point in hia story Hunt
er's experiences are those of nearly
every man who has been the victim
of a* bunko man. A third party was
finally encountered and introduced to
Hunter, and then followed the sugges
tion of a poker game. Hunter admits
that he knows a little about the
American game and also confesses
that he hoped that the god of fortune
would kindly direct the cards in his
favor. There is where his fondest
hopes were shattered. The trio
agreed to rent a room in the lodging
house, the location of which Hunter
cannot, remember, and there they sat
down to play. Drugged wine was ad
ministered to the unsuspecting New
Zealander, whose cash was then tak
en, along with his certificates of ex
change. ,
Hunter was a picture of distress
when he returned to the California
Hotel yesterday, and immediately af
ter he had told his story he was ad
vised to report his case to the police.
The best the latter could do was to
detail two detectives to accompany
the New Zealander around the hotels
and nublic resorts with the hope that
he might recognize his acquaintance
of the previous night. Several hours
of this tiresome task, however, proved
fruitless and the disgusted colonist
finally returned to his apartments at
the California for a well deserved
rest. The local bank upon which the
certificates were drawn has been ad
vised not to cash them.
FIRE DEPARTMENT'S WORK ..
â¢ RECEIVES APPRECIATION
Battalion t'liiof Walters Is Presented
With a Beautiful Loving Cup by
His Associates.
The Fire Commissioners received
two checks of $100 each yesterday,
one from the California iiulphur
Works, the other from the San Fran
cisco Brick Company. The checks
were presented for meritorious service
performed by the Fire Department.
The money was ordered turned over
to the mutual aid fund and the wid
ows' and orphans' fund.
On motion of Commissioner Parry
it was decided that all claims for in
debtedness against firemen must be
presented to Chief Sullivan.
The following appointments were
made from the eligible Us.: J. W.
Beldin, engineer; Edward F. Downs,
hoseman; Charles H. Rochette, hose
man, and M. J. Dolan, hoseman. The
Civil Service Commission approved of
the dismissal of Frank L. Stahl and
John Barry.
Chief Sullivan was ordered to report
the matter of annual vacations for
members of the department. There is
still some doubt in the minds of the
Commissioners as to the length of
time a man should serve before he is
considered deserving of a vacation.
The matter of days off for employes of
the corporation yard was left to the
discretion of the superintendent.
Battalion Chicf f Walters received a
beautiful loving cup last night from
the men working with him. The pres
entation was made at Engine House
No. 21. Chief Sullivan and Commis
sioner Wreden were among those
present.

AUTHOR MEETS
HIS ADMIRERS
H. Rider Haggard Spends a
Pleasant Afternoon With
Readers of His Stories
RECEPTION AT PALACE
Will Address the Students
of Berkeley This Morning,
Then Leave for Denver
H. Rider Haggard, usually slow and
deliberating, had a taste of strenuosity
yesterday that mill probably last him
tor at least a week. At noon the dis
tinguished PJnglish writer was the
guest of a number of prominent Call
fornians at luncheon at the Bohemian
Club, among his entertainers being
James D. Phelan, Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, A. tfbarboro, Kufus Jennings
and Joaquin Miller. After an hour at
the club he was escorted to the Palace
Hotel, where he held a public reception
iii the main parlors on the first floor.
The occasion afforded many who
have enjoyed Haggard s interesting
stories an opportunity to greet and
converse with him. and seemingly he
vr-ts as well pleased with the affair as
were hib callers. Certainly there were
a number of visitors who deeply in
terested him, for he plainly demon
strated the fact by his manner of hold
ing them in conversation despite the
efforts of others to get within his hear
ing and grasp his hand. There was a
young lady who had not only read his
novels, but had enjoyed the distinction
of having been in the cast of "She"
on the occasion of its first production
in San FranciKco.
But a few feet behind this young
woman was a man of marked literary
tastes, who related to Haggard the
pleasures he had given to a band of
rugged woodchuppers in Northern Cal
ifornia some years ago, while isolated
with them in the snow-bound forest,
by reading at night under the flicker
ing light of a camp rire chapters of
"King Solomon's Mine." Another in
teresting caller was a man from South
Africa, who joined with the author in
reviving the incidents of early life in
the far-off British possessions, and an
other saluted Haggard .with the re
mark that he hud known Captain Hag
gard, brother of the author, who, too,
lias attached his signature to many
popular writings.
Of all the afternoons visitors none
probably drew closer to them the Eng
libh author than the man who recall
ed to Haggard the little church in
Norwood, where-, aa Haggard has told
in 'one of his stories, he once saw a
beautiful faceâ of one whom he never
knew, but of one that had been an in
spiration to him in later years. The
man explained that he, too, attended
the Norwood chapel when Haggard
was wont to gaze upon that Tiandsome
face, and years later, when he had pe
rused the lines written by Haggard, he
had racked his mind to recall the iden
tity of the samu sweet face.
It was in this pleasant manner that
San Francisco admirers of Haggard
entertained him. Surrounding him
were many of the city's most prom
inent citizens, who enjoyed the remin
iscences of the writer's past life.
Among them were the city's , Mayor,
members of the bench and bar, repre
sentatives tit. various commercial bod
ies, fair maids und matrons, and, scat
tered here ami there, youths who gazed
in wonderment upon the tall figure and
kind features of the author of many
of the weird tales they had read.
This morning Haggard will be the
guest of President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler at the State University, and
will address the student body of that
institution for half an hour. In the
evening he leaves for Colorado as the
guest of John Hays Hammond in the
latter's private car.

Fred Hanke, 1522 Webster street, reported to

gold plecr to get changed at the corner gro
cery. The red<llÂ«r did not return.

GRAHAM CAUSES
RECONCILIATION
Judge Brings Together Two
Coujftes That Were Litigat
ing in the Divorce Court
PATTRIDGE IX TROUBLE
Term in Prison Threatens to
Bring His Second Honey
moon to an Abrupt End
Two more reconciliations stand to
the credit of Superior Judge Graham.
Sylvia Cheadle was before him yester
day morning to press her suit for di
vorce against Ernest R. Cheadle, but
after listening to the reasoning n* the
court for a while she admitted that she
had no real grievance against her hus
band md. as he had none against her,
their differences were soon patched up
and they left the court together.
Cheadle is a Southern Pacific brake
man. On February 20 last he went
away or. a northbound, train and as
he did not return when his wife ex
pected him she concluded that he had
deserted her. and wired to her mother
at Butte, Mont., asking what was best
to be done. Her mother immediately
directed her to sue for divorce. This
she did, naming cruelty as the cause
of action. Cheadle returned shortly
after the suit was filed and sought a
reconciliation, but his wife was obdur
ate. Judge Graham's suggestion that
she go back to her husband gave moral
support to her desire to return to him,
however, so she yielded and all is well
again in the family of Cheadle.
It developed that the trouble that
caused Mary R. Stuart to sue Wil
liam Stuart, a foreman of longshore
men, for a divorce, centered around a
piece of property in Berkeley, half of
which the husband claimed. As the
value of the property is not great
enough to wrangle over, Judge Graham
suggested to Stuart that he give his
wife a deed quieting claifn to the prop
erty. She promised to return to him
if this was done and he showed his
good faith and confidence in her. He
promised to give the property back,
so they left the court together and
from appearances their reconciliation
has been effected. They have six chil
dren and this fact appealed to the
court as the principal reason why they
should forget their woes and go back
to their home.
Though in debt for alimony due his
former wife, Robert K. Pattridge mar
ried again. His honeymoon, however,
threatens to be cut short by a term in
jail for contempt of court. Judge
Troutt issued an order directing the
Sheriff to proceed to Petaluma, take
Pattridge into custody and hold him in
