â¢ 8ACRA2Â£Â£NTO, Dec 29.-J-A number of convicts at Folsom attempted
late this afternoon to repeat the successful prison break of 1903 and as a
* 'resv't three of them are dead and five of them wounded. In carrying: out
their plot they assaulted Captain of the Guard R. J. Murphy and Charles
â¢Jolly, stabbing Murphy in the back with on* of the crudely fashioned knivca
â¢they carried. t
JThe guards, in obedience to the standing orders of Warden Archibald
Tell, opened flre on the mutinous convicts. The persons of the officers of the
prison were not regarded as sacred by the prison force and they were not
. permitted to be used as shields by the conspirators. One bullet of the num
ber rained into the group by his own guards hit Captain Murphy in tha
le?, -while another struck Guard Charles Jolly in the back of the neck and
.. came out at his Jaw, producing an ugly and dangerous wound.
.â¢ At the first shot Warden Tell rushed to the scene and with his maga
zint revolver kept up a fusillade into the crowd of convicts. As the War
den is a dead shot, it is probable that he did not miss his mark.
The attempted break was made at the rock crusher quarry, regarded as
â¢ the place of all others at the prison calling for watchfulness owing to the
opportunities for escape it offers. The canal which leads from the dam to
j the 'power house at Folsom runs by the quarry and a email bridge crosses
it ta the prison railroad track. A guard armed with a rifle is stationed at
this bridge, while several guard posts overlook the track at various points.
I .The convicts who engaged in the break were all employed in the rock
â¢crusher, where 225 of the most desperate prisoners were at work. Captain
. " Murphy acts as general overseer about the rock crusher and spends consider
able" time there. Four other prison attaches, L. Daly, M. Hogan, Charles
Taylor and Charles Jolly, are employed there as "puEhere," to keep the men
. at xfork. At the time of the attempted break a large sledge hammer was
.thrown into the crusher, causing the ponderous machine to come to a
â¢ standstill. This attracted Captain Murphy, Charles Jolly and Charles Tay
"l;>r to the crusher. Thereupon the desperate convicts rushed to seize Mur
. pfiy. Jolly and Taylor, succeeding only in catching the two first mentioned.
They also endeavored to take the other free men who managed to escape
. them. _ -\ â¢ v.
GUAED3 OPEN FIRE OX THE COISTVICTS.
The scene ot trouble was under cover and the guards on the outside
could not see the struggle, although they soon had an intimation that some
thing was wrong.
The convicts, with their captives, made their way toward a small post
commanded 'by Guard W. H. Harris, who was armed with a trusty rifle
Five of the gang surrounded Captain Murphy and two of them had Jolly'
the murderous knives being held In position for immediate execution should
they attempt to free themselves. The prisoners had no sooner stepped
into the open than the guards commenced firing, and within twenty sec
ends fully one hundred shots had been fired and tha seven convicts were
on the ground helpless.
The convicts were very bold as they approached Guard Harris who
Bteod ready to act according to th*> standing orders to shoot regardless
of consequences. When within forty feet of him one of them gave the
command, "Hajid out your gun or we will stab Murphy to the heart." In
6*ead of handing out the rifle Harris sent a bullet into the fellow's body
end In <juick succession he pumped a bullet at each of the remaining pris
oners, who were trying to shield themselves behind Murphy and Jolly
"Bough House" Kelly, the last of the convicts shot, had borne Murphy
to -the ground with him and was under the officer for protection. With
T.onderful coolness and nerve Murphy wriggled about until Harris could
draw a bead on Kelly and one shot took all the fight out of him. In the
meantime bullets from other posts were flying thickly about, many of them
I striking the convicts. ; -> -
The guards who did the shooting, besides Harris, were O. C. Lewis
T. Foley and W. Gallagher, on post 11; L. Anderson, on 10; D. W WHev'
on 12, and J. Woods, on 13. Â»*"ey.
To have made their escape from the prison the convicts would have
had to go up or down the railroad track, through a long line of guards
They evidently depended on capturing Harris' rifle to successfully carâ¢
out their plans. The knives used were big, dangerous looking weapons that
had evidently been concealed many months in the rocks.
â WABDEX ACTS WITH GREAT COOLNESS.
At the first shot Warden Tell rushed to the scene and gave orders for
his men to continue .their flre. Only the canal separated him fronT tha
fighting convicts, when he drew his own revolver and aided In the deadly
execution which the bullets were working on tha other.side of the canal
Drfage. . .
One convict, named Campbell, started to Join tha mutineers, but he got
no farther than half way across the bridge before a bullet stopped him

pumps, white tieâ fine! When he saw
the attractive Miss Wyman he began
*> twist a blonde mustache in the most
captivating manner. He walked by her
two or three times, ogling at her. He
might have been in Tokio for all the
attention she paid him. Finally he
halted at her elbow, raised his hat and
spoke to her.
With a combined movement, quick as
lightning, Miss Wyman thrust her
right arm across the blonde mustache's
unmanly bosom Xinder his chin and
seized his left shoulder, put 'her right
foot across his ankles, grabbed the
small of his back with her left hand
and with both arms gave him a pull
and a shove. Before he had time to
think the young man was hurled head
over heels into the 'middle of Fifty
ninth street.
He Jumped up, picked up his hat and,
.hastily trying to rub the- sticky mud
from his clothing, ; hurried down Madi

Men waiting for the cars realized
what had occurred and they to^d Miss

NEW YORK, Dec 29. â Two .'home
less men, fast friends in misfortune,
and known up and down the* Bowery
as "Happy" and "Jolly," became tired
of the struggle for existence . and 'on
Wednesday entered into a death com
pact. Their bodies were found to-day,
side by side in a room of the Union
Hotel, on the Bowery. A six-ounce
bottle of cyanide of potassium, con
taining enough poison to kill 'an ele
phant, was grasped In the hand of
"Happy." Letters to the public, writ
ten by each man, were found. Indicat
ing an agreement to quit together.
Under the names of George Webster
and George Brown the men had been
known at the Union Hotel for more
than a year. Whence they came, their
calling or former . station in â  Ufa and
whether the names were real or as
sumed were matters Into which the
Bowery never inquired. Both were
fairly well dressed and were able to
write letters which indicated education
and culture. They were inseparable
companions and one never appeared at
the hotel without the other. They al
ways took a double room under the
names of -Webster and. Brown.
Cheerful In adversity, they soon.be
came known as "Happy" and "Jolly,"
but the letters they left told stories of
hardships and privation they could en
dure no longer.

HARRIMAN CUTS
RATES ON SEAS
Begins War on the Lumber
Schooners Plying Between
This Port and Portland
SCHWEBIX TO THE FORE
Charters Vessels to Fight
Competitors in the Inter
est of Oregon Merchants
President E. H. Harriman of the big
Western railroad system and steamship
lines has declared war on the lumber
schooner owners engaged in ocean traf
fic between here and Portland. Yes
terday the first step was taken by the
railroad magnate to show the schooner
men that he means business, when the
.echooner Nome City was offered on the
Columbia River to carry lumber to this
City at a rate of $2 50 per 1000, which
is $1 50 less than the regular^ rate
charged by the schooners. This an
nouncement was followed by the dec
laration that the Harriman people
were ready to place several more
schooners on the route and that unless
the schooner men quit cutting rates the
Oregon Railroad and Navigaiori Com
pany, through which Harriman is act-
Ing, will carry on the war relentlessly.
Harriman's move is the result of a
recent protest made by the merchants
and jobbers of Portland to General
Manager Schwerin of the Oregon RaiU
road and Navigation Company, to the
effect that the schooner men were cut
ting rates below those of the Oregon
Kailroad and Navigation Company,
thus greatly injuring business in that
city. A representative of the com
mercial bodies of Portland was sent
to this city to confer with General
Manager Schwerin, who assured them
that he would take the matter up with
president Harriman and Trafllc Direc
tor Stubbs. The result was a decision
to charter several schooners and enter
Into competition with the schooner
men. The first vessel chartered was
the Nome City, the property of George
1*.' Gray & Co., having a carrying ca
pacity of 1.000.000 feet.
â¢ The trouble has been agitating the
Portland business men for several
weeks. Some time ago Russell &
Rogers were operating the schooner
Kllburn between here and Watson
x-ille and It is claimed that the South
ern Pacific Company suddenly deprived
them of the business by cutting the
rate by rail to that point. In' conse
quence the owners of the schooner
were compelled to take off their vessel
and finally placed her on the coast be
tween here and Portland. They are
said to have begun the rate cutting.
It was quickly followed by the owners
of other schooners who find it profitable
to carry freight on deck and lumber
below deck. It Is also said that the
echooner men. who, in the recent pas
senger rate war with the Pacific Coast
Fteamsh!p Company, in which the Har
riman lines were also involved to some
extent, settled their troubles by an
agreement to a water rate of $12 50, as
against the Oregon Railroad and Navi
gation Company's regular rfite of $15.
Lately it Is charged that the schooner
men, encouraged by the increasing
passenger business between here and
Portland, as a result of the approach-
Ing opening of the Lewis and Clark
exposition, have been cutting their rate
to $10 and this fact is supposed to have
aroused the Indignation of. Harriman
and is expected to end in his making
a further move to block the schooner
men in their scheme to get more than
Harriman considers their share of the
passenger traffic. j

Plot to Escape From the Prison Was Well Planned,
but Was Frustrated by Courageous Guards.

and he returned limping, with a wound in the leg and his desire for free
dom vanished. He is thought not to have been one. of the plotters, but
merely to- have deemed the, chance' a good one to get away.
Warden Yell Intended that the lesson which the convicts, were learning
should be as impressive as possible. Up to this time about fifty shots had
been fired, but only from rifles and re'/olvers. With a wave of his hand
the Warden caused the Gatling guns in the high turrets to send hun
dreds of their deadly pellets scurrying along the path which the convicts
bad hoped would, secure them their freedom. They did no harm other
than tear up the ground along their course, but the deafening discharge
and the havoc down the. roadway struck terror to the convicts and their
sympathizers. Â» â¢ â¢
When the firing had ceased It was found that Guard Jolly was badly in
jured. A buliet from the rifle of one of the guards had entered his neck,
at the back and issued from the front of his jaw. The wound was a ghast- '
ly one. and it was feared that Jolly had but a short time to live. When
brought to the hospital and treated by the surgeon he revived and was'
able to speak. It Is thought to-night he will recover.
Captain Murphy was stabbed in the back by one of. the convicts, but
not seriously. A shot also struck the officer in the leg, and he limped with
difficulty to the prison. ' â¢
A general'lock-up of the prisoners 'followed the first appearance of'trou-'
ble, but enough of the convicts were still about to View the grew-'
some procession of carts wh}ch carried their dead and Wounded fellows
from the crusher quarry to the prison morgue and hospital. Not ona
of the conspirators escaped, and the only convicts who failed to respond
to the turnkey's call at the final lock-up to-night were the^three Tying
dead In the morgue' and the five more or less dangerously, wounded on: the
hospital cots.

of the summer of 1903. The convicts were emboldened by the success of that
venture. They have been waiting for a chance to repeat it, and it came to
day with a result that the convicts shall not soon forget. They probably
thought we would not shoot, but they were fooled. One of them, after he
had crossed the canal bridge, went up to "a guard and demanded his gun.
Doubtless the convict thought the guard would recognize the force of pre
cedent and hand it over. Instead of that, he turned the weapon on the con

The quiet, gray-bearded Admiral Togo,

on at that time. Those who saw Louis
just after his death testified that he

"Did you hit anybody?" the Warden was asked.
"Well, now, don't ask that," said Warden Tell, smiling. "Everybody was
shooting, you know, and some, of them hit, so let it go at that. I don't
know how many' sfidtaTI fired. I haven't had time yet to examine my maga
zine. I cannot say now how many were involved in or knew about this
move to escape. That it was a well planned conspiracy Is of course evi
dent.. The men were armed .with knives fashioned from such pieces of metal
as they could, in the course of months past, lay hands on and sharpen in
their cells. I shall make a thorough investigation into the whole affair. I
have known for a long time that this thing was coming, indeed, smce I have
been Warden I have broken up several plots to escape before they had got
as far as this one. The men Involved in to-day's break are what we call
bad prisoners. Most of them were in for life or long terms and they were
regarded as desperate, men. I think their plan was to. make off In. the direc
tion of Folsom and they expected It would be more or less easy for them to
run by one guard post after another. However, they did not get the chance
to run by any." i i'

of Hawaii, "urges in strong language
the amendment of the Chinese exclu

the natives will not work in the fields,

WITH THE BISHOP

time because of an understanding
baaed on the condition that Irvine
would not appeal from the court's de
cision suspending him from the minis
try for one year. The present contro
versy, in which Bishop TaJbot and the
deposed rector of the Huntingdon
church are the central figures, resulted
in the publication of the document.
The verdict found Irvine guilty of
eleven out of twenty specifications
which were embraced in the general
charges of suggestion of what is false,
suppression of the truth, intention to
deceive, falsification . of official , docu
ment, falsehood, false swearing and
lascivious conduct The specifications
on which he was found guilt* covered
all of these general charges, and Irvine
was suspended from the ministry for
one year. He remained, for several
months afterward in this city, attempt
ed to establish an independent church,
held a few meetings in the opera-house,
performed a couple of marriages and
other priestly functions in defiance of
the decision of the diocesan court, but
finally gave up the fight and went
East.
CHARGES ARE SEXSATIONAIa
The court that tried Irvine met In
this city. in December, 1884. The trial
was a.lengthy one and the verdict was
not given until January, 1885. One of
the counts on which Irvine was found
guilty was the alleged misrepresenta
tion of an utterance of Mrs. Burgess.
The most serious charge against Ir
vine was made by Miss Maria W. Sea
body, a young woman with whose fam
ily he had become acquainted in Long
Island City, where Irvine was once
connected with. St. James Church. On
August 25, 1884, the young woman was
married to J. J. Miller, organist of the
Cathedral of St. John in this city. Two
weeks later she told her husband of Ir
vine's alleged conduct toward her while
in his home, alleging that he had sev
eral times invaded her chamber and
torn the bed clothing from her/while
she was asleep at night and that he
once tore her night robes from her.
No criminal act was charged. Miller
caused his wife to write a statement to
the Bishop, and' this, coupled with
other alleged reasons, caused the Bish
op to ask Irvine to leave the ministry.
Irvine refused and the trial followed.
BISHOP JIAY BE ARRESTED.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 29.â Friends
of Rev. Dr. Irvine have determined to
fight to a finish the charges preferred
against Bishop Talbot. â  If a technical
ity in canonical procedure cause a
failure of the present presentment, they
will file a new presentment against the
Bishop, with charges of an even more
surprising character.
That the friends of the unfrocked
rector are powerful and men of means
is shown by the fact that nearly 200
witnesses have been summoned to ap
pear at Reading in Dr. Irvine's behalf.
The report of a possible arrest came
to-day in answer to an editorial by
John Fulton in the Standard, the local
church organ. Dr. Fulton is an ac
knowledged authority on canonical law.
In an editorial he broadly intimated
that, owing to the new canon adopted
recently In Boston covering the pre
sentment of a Bishop, the present pro
ceedings must fail. It was Impossible
for Dr. Irvine to sue for criminal libel
upon the letter concerning him, written
by Bishop Talbot to Dr. Samuel Up
john, because of the statute of limita
tions. It is now asserted, however, that
Bishop Talbot sent a - copy of the let
ter to Dr. Fulton last July and upon
this criminal proceedings, it is said,
could be begun if the friends of Dr.
Irvine found it was going to be impos
sible to get a hearing before the court
of inquiry.
Dr. Irvine's agents are busy delving
into the record of several persons con
nected with the case and upon some of
the Information thus obtained the pre
sentors may ask leave in secret session
to substitute an amended presentment.
Every effort Is being made by most of
the churchmen to eliminate from the
discussion of the case any reference to
Mrs. Elliott.
DR. IRVINE'S STATEMENT.
"May a Bishop or ought a
Bishop write defamatory letters
in secret in order to Injure any
member of ,the â  ministry?" This
ia the question that vrill be decided
at the meeting of the board of lnaulry
in the case of Irvine vs. Talbot." aald
the Rev. N. W. Irvine, the plaintiff in
the celebrated case, to-day, in discuss
ing the" charges which have, been mada
against him.
"My reinstatement." continued Dr.
Irvine, "is of secondary consideration
when contrasted with the foregoins
query. Of course, I wish to have this
unjust deposition removed/ but I wish
also, entirely without malice, to be vin
dicated In the sight, of God and my
friends."
In discussing the motive for the ore
sentment. Dr. Irvine said that it -was
because he had persistently, refused to
serve communion to Mrs. Emma D. El
liott of Huntingdon, Pa., who is di
vorced, against the wishes of Blahoo
Talbot. |
"Bishop Talbot and I. alonsr with
about 1600- other members of the min
istry," said Dr. Irvine, "signed the
declaration which was sent to all the
Bishops and '" clergy" In the United
States and presented to the general
convention of 1S98, .and. which craved
for more stringent restrictions in the
matter of divorce and remarriasre.
"The canons of the church orovida
explicitly that a man or a woman di
vorced on any charge except one,
which must "be proved beyond thÂ»
bounds of reasonable doubt, cannot re
ceive the holy sacrament. In the face
of this Bishop Talbot. while he pub
licly supported the petition, covertly
and by secret meetings with Mrs. El
liott, who is a woman divorced on the
ground of desertion, sought to have her
remain in the church.
"Now, who was the more consistent.
Bishop Talbot or I? Did we not. both
of us. sign the petition mentioned? I^Â»
it not curious that Bishop Talbot. al
though he had written me savins' that
Mrs. Elliott was, by canon, excommu
nicated,, should, by other methods.
seek to retain her as a communicant?"
THAT LETTER TO DR. TTPJOIIX.
Referring. to the letter which Bishoo
Talbot is said to have written- to Dr.
Upjohn, in which the former termed
Dr. Irvine a "plausible romancer,.''
charged that he waa deposed for gross
Immorality, and stated that "for twen
ty out of the thirty years of his serv
ice in the ministry he was under ecde-
Eia&tical discipline." Dr. Irvine said
that Bishop. Talbot has placed himself
In a most awkward position.
"That letter to Dr. Upjohn was un
warranted and cruel." said Dr. Irvin*.
"since it was. first of all. a gross sub
terfuge. It was used secretly as a
weapon against me to deprive me of all
sympathy, respect and even mainte
nance.
"In the first place, It Is an utter Im
possibility for the -allegations to bo
true. The church law requires that a
minister shall not be eligible to ad
mittance to another diocese when leav
ing one unless he bears the letter de
mfssary.' This letter shows that the
departing minister has a clear record;
that his life Is beyond reproach, freo
from error in religion and viciousnesa
in life, and must be signed by the
Bishop. How could I, therefore, be guilty
of the charges made against me?
"Bishop "Whltehead of the diocese of
Pittsburg. Bishop Adams of the dio
cese of Easton, Md., the last two dio
ceses in which I served, as well as the
Bishops of. all the dioceses In which I
lived prior to this, have given me these
letters, which secured me the dcslre.l
admission to new fields.
"Bishop Talhot has In his allegations
Indirectly accused his brother Bishops
of fraud upon the church in their issu
ance of these letters to me. The Bish
ops whose names he quotes in his at
tack upon my character have been
placed In a position which reflects dis
credit upon their reputations, or Bishop
Talbot's accusations are absolutely
false â and I know that the word of
these gentlemen cannot be Impugned."
.Dr. Irvine said in conclusion that he
was not a member of the Catholic Club
nor had he ever made any accusations
in the club or had word3 with Dr. Up
john. â¢'?.-?-

committee consisting of four members
and the three officers.
DISCUSS TENURE OF OFFICE.
A discussion ensued, in which ob
jection was raised to its adoption on
the ground that it would tend to sep
arate the Elementary Association from
the California Teachers' Association.
It was finally decided to submit a draft
of the constitution to the executive
committee for further consideration.
The regular programme was then
taken up. Charles Hildesley of this
city rendered a vocal solo, "Love's Sor
row," and Mrs.' Ella B. McDowell fol
lowed with the solos, "A Red Rose"
and "Slumber Song." As an encore she
gave "Ben Bolt."
Professor Snedden gave an address
on "The Possibilities of Scope and
Method as Suggested by the New State
Arithmetic." It was an interesting pa
per and was greatly enjoyed by the
teachers. .
There was a large attendance at the
meeting of the High School Teachers'
Association, which was presided over
by Dr. Scott of San Francisco.
The first paper read was one by E.
M. Cox of the Santa Rosa High School
on "Tenure of Office." He was opposed
to legislating a teacher either in or out
of office. The present system of all po
sitions being declared legally vacant at
the close of the school year was de
clared to be vicious. He said a teachei
should be employed just as long as his
or her employment serves the best in
terests of the school.
A general discussion of the paper fol
lowed, in which the opinion was ex
pressed that the question of tenure was
even more urgent than the salary ques
tion.
"Professional Ethics" was the sub
ject of a paper by J. C. Chrlstensen of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
EL. PASO, Texas, Dec. 29.â After
wandering for an Indefinite period on
the desert in a demented condition, his
clothing in tatters and his food such as
he could gather unobserved at night.
Robert Heider, the sixteen-year-old
son of Mrs. Maggie Heider of Oakland.
Cal., was rescued by the authorities of
Stanton, Texas, and is now aboard a
Sunset Limited train in care of Dr. J.
R. French, returning to his old home
on the Pacific Coast.
The boy was found in an old building
on the plains near Stanton. He was in
a pitiable plight and unable to give an
account of himself. His mind was a
blank and he was unable to tell his
name or place of residence. He was
identified by means of letters found in
his pockets. A memorandum book con
tained notes showing that he had been
to the World's Fair and led those who
read them to believe that the lad had
lost his mind since leaving St. Louis,
probably through hardships encoun
tered.
A telegram to the boy's mother
brought a prompt reply. She wired
$200 to the Sheriff with instructions
that the small lunatic be sent home in
care of some competent person. Dr.
French agreed to make the Journey and
arrived here to-day with the- lad chain
ed to his wrist. The boy is apparently
a hopeless idiot. He has lost one eye
and is a wreck of humanity.

It is not believed thai the stories of a
settlement are well founded except that
threats have been made to Lawson. It
is understood ' that some time ago a
friend of H. H. Rogers offered Lawson
$500,000 in settlement, but that Lawson
claimed Rogers owed him $1,000,000 and
would not settle for $500,000. Rumor of
a check for the larger amount from
Rogers to Lawson has been current for
several days, but Investigation by a

Albion's Weakness in Field
LONDON. Dec. 29.â "The Army as It
Was and as It Is to Be" Is the text
under which Field Marshal Earl Rob
erts, In the January Nineteenth Cen
tury, reads Britons a noteworthy lecture
on the duty of all classes if Great Brit
ain would meet the demands of modern
warfare. After frankly pointing out
existing deficiencies, Earl Roberts
writes:
A terrlflo lesson awaits the nation whose Â»ol
&ierÂ» And themselves opposed by equally brave
but better trained opponents on the field of bat
tle. No amount of money, no national aacrt
flces will then avail, tor modern warfare move*

hold this view vary itrongrly and would urÂ»Â»
my fellow countrymen with all the tore* at
my command u> look the plain {act* in dÂ»
face.
Earl Roberts does not advocate com
pulsory service, "because it is distaste
ful to the nation and incompatible with.
the conditions of an army which has &
large proportion of units in foreign ser
vice." but maintains that Great Britain
must have a large reserve force. Ha
continues :
If the citizens of so great and prosperooa a
nation as ours are to remain exempt from
compulsory aervlc* In time of peacÂ» without
the safety of the empire being endangered,
the right class of men mutt ba attracted to tit*

state to see that every able-bodied man la
this country, no matter to what grade of so
ciety hi may belong, 'wide reots som* kind of
military training in youth sufficient to enable
him to shoot straight and carry out maple
orders if aver his services are required for na
tional defense.
Earl Roberts Interestingly review*
the changes of the last fifty years, de
scribes the military system prior to tha
Crimean War and points out how tha
introduction of modern suns necessi
tated the complete abolishment of the
Idea that men must be mere machines.
Officers, he says, are no longer directly
able to control the men, because tha
fighting formation has been changed,
and therefore tha men must have a far
higher standard of individual Intelli
gence, while among the officers intelli
gence, self-reliance and type of leading,
men must be on a proportionately
higher leveL
The sooner this Is realized to the full
est extent. Earl Roberts says, the bet
ter for all ranks when the hour of trial
comes.
Earl Roberts says the report of the
committee on the war In South Africa
made it clear that much is still needed
before Great Britain has an army fit in
all respects for war with a modern for-
elgn power. Among other things, he
said, she must have a larger proportion
of mounted troops for rapid reinforce
ment and In order to quickly/ seize
points of vantage. He refers to the
action of the Government in ordering
new quick-firing guns for the complete
re-equipment of the army.
Simultaneously with Earl Roberts'
article, it Is officially announced that
160 batteries will be supplied with new
guns at a cost of $17.500, COO and that
the order will be executed within twen
ty months.

WIFE SAYS HER HUSBAND
HAD THREATENED KEELEY
Mrs. Bruce Melcalie Declares Jlurder Was Not Due to Conspiracy
A woman's uncertainty and a woman's
Tvhljps and carricfes led to the murder
of 'Edward Bruce Metcalfe early yes
terday trioraing. In the unraveling of
the tale of love and tragedy there was
.found a thread of circumstantial evi
'dence. Â«hat seemed to vaguely lead to
the conclusion that Metcalfe was killed
as the flnaje of a desperate plot, in
which his 'ftife and her companion were
the chief plotters.
Edward Keeley, -an ironworker, with
â whom Mrs. Metcalfe has been Intimate
for a long time, is suspected of having
ehot Metcalfe to death; Mrs. Metcalfe
is eupposed to have lured her husband
to 22ifc Seventh street, where the Ehoot-
Ing ioo place, for the purpose of giving
Keeley. opportunity to pick a quarrel
with him. The man who has been most
emphatic In advancing thia theory is
John Metcalfe, a brother of the mur
dered man. who lives at LO'j Gough
street.
Last evening Mrs. Metcalfe stated
jjositively that Keeley was seen in the
hallway after the shooting. She also
added that her husband had freauently
threatened Keeley's life. In her opin
ion KeeJey had learned of her meeting
with her husband and hurried to the
latter's lodging to fir.d her. entering
ju*t as a fight between herself and
Metcalfe was taking place.
In the divorce courts yesterday the
case of Metcalfe versus Metcalfe was

when a loud rap came on the door.
3IUUDERER ENTERS.
"Who is that?" shouted Metcalfe.
There was a low sound, as of some
one cursing and eaying, "Let me In,"
and then the photographer Jumped
from his bed and opened the door.
Mrs. Metcalfe. according to her story
to the police, ran from the room to the
rear of the bouse. Regarding what
happened thereafter she made state
ments that were contradictory In essen
tial points. First she said that when
she left the room she hid in the back
hall and a few minutes later saw a
man come from the Metcalfe room
"who looked something like Keeley."
Later she declared that Keeley was the
man who came from the room and that
he had done the shooting. Captain Bur
nett gave orders that no one but police
officials interview the woman until her
story could be put in shape for legal
evidence in the trial.
To strengthen the theory that there
was a plot to do Metcalfe bodilv harm
or to murder him Detective Whitaker
offered Captain Burnett evidence to
show that Keeley had procured a pistol
about three days ago.
To the police documents was attached
the story told by John Metcalfe, which
he repeated to an interviewer, as fol
lows: --*t:\
For some time I have been Â«ust>lclous that
my brother was poir.e to get into trouble with
his wife â that 1Â«, serious trouble. I knew that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1904.
Keeley lived In the eame house with the
woman at 603 Eddy street, where Mrs. Met
ca.!fe occupied a room near that rented by
Keeley. They were continually in each oth
er's comj>ariy. Several night* ago 1 accom
panied my brother to his lodgings and as I
was passlns down Seventh street I noticed
Mrs. Metcalfe and KeMey lurking In a door
way. I then urced my brother to come home
with me, as I was afraid that there was a put
u^ job en hand to do him up. He did as I
requested.
HAS BEEN" THREATENED.
Bruce has told me that he was threatened
by his wife and that Keeiey and she were
planning to gÂ« married as soon as the divorce
was cranu-d. The fact that Bruce was going
to file a crops complaint In the divorce pro
ceedings on the grounds of intemperance and
Infidelity angered Mrs. Metcalfe. There was
no doubt that she was much Infatuated with
Keelej- and was anxious that her marriage
with, him be hastened.
Lodgers at 22^ Seventh street say
that -the mysterious woman in the
case" was heard In Metcalfe's room
at an early hour of the evening* She
was heard to say "Good-by," â¢ Boon
after which Metcalfe went out of the
house. The woman is supposed to be
in no way connected with the shooting,
and was undoubtedly only ohe of the
several . women with whom Metcalfe
is said to have been intimately ac
quainted. Mrs. Metcalfe's answer to
the charge of conspiracy was as fol
lows:
I do not know much about the circum
stance* of this case. I was so excited, so
surprised at It all. AH I know Is that at 1:45
o clock in the morning I heard a loud knock
at the door and my husband ran to the fore
and called out loudly, "Who Is there? " I got
out of bed Just as the door was opened and a
man whisked past me. I ran to a room In the
rear of the building. There was a flash and
two shots. and the man, who looked something
like Keeley, ran down the hall and out or the
place.
The woman's other statement to the
polio* -was that she "saw Keeley run
out. He did the shooting; I am inno
cent."/
The detectives visited the lodgings
of Keeley an hour after the shooting
took place and made a careful search
of his room. The landlady of the house,
G03 Eddy street, is Mrs. A. M. Fox, and
she said that there was not a more
sober, pleasant man than Keeley
among those to whom she has rented
rooms.
KEELEY'S CHARACTER.
"Keeley is a structural iron worker,"
said Mrs. Fox, "and he was employed
on the new lV>stoifice building. He
never made any trouble, and was not
a drinking man. To prove to you
what kind of a heart he had, I had a
litter of kittens that I wanted drown
ed and asked him if he would attend
to the rather disagreeable job for me.
He laughed and replied: 'If you would
buy me some milk for them, Mrs. Fox
I think I would rather feed them than
drown them.' A strange contradiction
in human character, isn't it?"
Keeley claimed to have been a great
friend of F. H. McCarthy and Eugene
Clancey. union leaders. Keeley is said
to be an ardent unionist.
Last night Mrs,. Metcalfe was allowed
to talk freely with newspaper men.
She answered questions put to her. by
Captain' Burnett and the reporters and
said that contradictions , in former
statements were due to the excitement
under which she had labored when ar
rested. She said in part:- r,-v
I am positive I saw Keeley in the hall and
I am equally as positive that he shot Metcalfe
I am confused as to whether there was a rap
ping at the door before my husband opened it'
but I do know that he had been striking me!
and when the door opened he started to chase
me down the hallway. I ran to a closet, then
to a bedroom, and saw from the latter ulace
tlie flÂ«*h of two shots.

\es. there was another woman In the room
when I arrived, but she left the place as soon
as I came In. She said she was there *o see
a man named. Charlie Moore. She had nothing
whatever to do with the case.
Mrs. Metcalfe then added that her
husband had often threatened Keeley.
He had visited, the ironworker's lodg
ings the afternoon before the shooting
and had hammered on the door. She
had heard her husband make threats
to kill Keeley. â¢','â â¢
Detective Whitaker found , that the
pistol that Keeley carried and with
which he probably shot Metcalfe was
given to him by one Sample, a lodger
at 603 Eddy .street. There had been

another man and the former was afraid

that he could control his temper -In a

STOCKTON. Dec. 29.â Edward J.
Lawson, heir to a share of the estate
of Jacob Lawson of Brooklyn, is a resi

furniture store. Lawson said to-day
that his father's home had been in
Augusta, Me., but that he had lived in
New York for a time. Lawson left
Augusta two years ago and came to
California. Since that time he has not
heard directly from his relatives in the
East. His father was well to do, but
not a millionaire.
The news of Lawson's good fortune
is remarkable by reason of a peculiar
cc incidence. Lawson a rew days ago
visited a local clairvoyant and had his
fortune told- He was informed that
there was in the East a large amount
of money belonging to him and that
he would hear of it shortly. The for
tune teller professed to be unable to
give him any further particulars. Law
son said that the words made no im
pression upon him until a reporter
showed - him the dispatch from New
York. He is not at all enthusiastic
over his prospects, but will place him
self In communication with his rela
tives.

and threatened me.
"I never said to any one that I heard
Ed (Keeley) say 'Annie, we've got him

Charles and Ethel Byrne, who occu

and the response "Get away from

think It likely that it was he.
Keeley is described by the police as

MAKES A PLEA
FOR FILIPINOS
Better Government in the
Islands Desired by East
ern University Professor
CHICAGO, Dec. 29.â Professor Paul
Relhsch of the University | of Wiscon
sin made a plea for better government
for the Philippine Islands before the
American Political Science Association
to-day. His subject was "Colonial Au
tonomy."
The speaker declared the
States Is carrying. out a mixed policy of
assimilation and autonomy through the
assimilation of our institutions. He as
serted that he did riot believe In such
assimilation as would give the Filipinos
statehood, because our experience with
the negroes and Chinese he believed
has shown that there are some races
that will not assimilate.
The afternoon session was devoted to
a discussion of the "Open and Closed
Shop," papers being read and speeches
made by a number of college professors,
business men and representatives of the
trade unions.
Professor John R.^ Commons of the
University of Wisconsin, in 'discussing
the "Causes of the Union Shop Policy,"
said: â â ;/ . ;*,
The union shop is labor's protective tariff.
It Is necessary where that kind of protection
Is not found. Wages In Government employ
ment depend on politics and universal suffrage
and do not need the protection o* the closed
shop. Railway employment is similar and the
railway brotherhoods are protected by a. long
line of promotion, while the scale of wages
is issued as a general order by the company
and applies to non-unionists as much as to
unionists.
The â  machinists' union, which is compelled
to protect itself by closed shop agreements In
general manufacturing, makes only open shop
agreements on railroads. Where employment
Is in the hands of small comDetlng contractors,
as In the building -and clothing trades, the
closed shop is necessary. The non-union con
tractor, with cheap and imported labor, would
drive the union contractor out of business. In
tne stove Industry, bituminous coal mines and
others, the agreements are open shop, but this
Is because the employers' associations are
strong .and willing enough to enforce the
agreement on all of their m-mbers. which the
unions could do only by strike or closed shop.
In these cases, the open shop question Is only
academic, because one association does not try
to destroy the other, but only to destroy the
excesses of the other.
John Graham Brooks, president of
the American Social .Science Associa
tion, read a paper entitled. "The Issue
Between the Open and Closed Shop."
He said in part:
There Is little use in discussing this subject
apart â  from the temper and purpose of the
pHrtles involved. A good many trad- unions
have used the closed shop principle and its
weapons both brutally and stupidly, but plenty
of employers are using the open shop in a
spirit that is probably more dangerous to social
welfare than th* coarseat ruffianism of the
trade unions. Side by side with these ex
cesBt-H we have open and closed shops in which
business is conducted with admirable and com
mon satisfaction. There Is not the slightest
dÂ»nper that the closed shop will become uni
versal In this country. Strong and well dis
ciplined unions do not need it.
A. Piatt Andrew of Harvard Univer
sity spoke of "Credit and the Value of
Money."
Professor David KInley of the Uni
versity of Illinois read a paper on "The
Relation of the Credit System to" the
Value of Money." In speaking of the
influence of the credit system on prices
Professor Kinley took the ground that
in general a business community will
make its exchanges with credit or by
money, according as one or the other
Is cheaper at the time, saying that the
credit â  system is really a regulator of
prices and allows changes In the vol
ume of .business without making nec
essary any' change -In the supply of
money. , /
Professor J. Lawrence Lauchlin of
the University of Chicago read a paper
on ' "The* Theory of Prices."

BANCROFT MAY
GET THE TITLE
Report From Chicago Says
He Is to Be General Man
ager of Southern Pacific
The latest report going the rounds of
the Southern Pacific Company's new
offices pn California street is that Act-
Ing General Manager W. H. Bancroft is
to become the permanent manager of
the big Western system of the Harrl
man lines on Monday next. Yesterday
a prominent officer of the Southern Pa
cific Company received a letter from
one of the heads of the Harriman lines
in Chicago rn .which, the writer, says
that Bancroft is slated to fill the posi
tion-of general manager of the South
ern Pacific, recently relinquished by C.
H. Markham. In addition to this inter
esting information the letter says that
Bancroft will soon retire from the posi
tion of general manager of the Union
Pacific, to the duties of which he has
been unable to give much attention
since he came to this city.
The writer says it is generally under
stood In Chicago that J. M. Graber,
general superintendent of the Union
Pacific, is to succeed Bancroft as gen
eral manager of the Western system
of the Union Pacific, and that W. L.
Parke of Cheyenne, superintendent of
the Wyoming division of the same road,
is to be Gruber's successor as general
superintendent. W. A. Whitney, assist
ant superintendent at Cheyenne, is
slated to become superintendent of the
Nebraska division, succeeding W. A.

fCBiaiaa that thÂ« financial affairs of the board
.are- in Â£Â«rreet shape, the accounts and vouch
er; are correct and there is no controversy be
i\i-e<"rc the board and the Controller's office.
We .come then to the matter which prÂ»
ripitated this lr.culry. Soon after the an
nouncement of tha results of the examinations
held by the board en April 12. 190*. and the
tf-.F'ee "following days, for admission to prac
tice as iictntlstfs and assistant licentiates,
various interviews and articles appeared in
tf.p public press of San Francisco and Oak
ls_nd charrlns the board broadly with favorit
ism at these examinations, stating that certain
<rueszioH5 given at the examination had been
piven rut :n advance to certain favored pupils,
.shat cribbing had been allowed, that discrim
ination hard been practiced !n the time allowed
for answering in some examinations, that dis
crimination had been practiced in marking
5Â«c.pers" and that outside friends of certain
scholar* had been allowed to be present and
aid tiiein. These articles held up the conduct
.% thes-e examinations as a fraud and a fright.
* 'CHARGES NOT SUSTAINED.
Your ccrnnittt* made a very close and pa
tient examination of ail the evidence obtaln
atle on this j>o;nt. There are two vacancies
on -the board. Dr. Crowley cf the board, it
-rcay be remarked in the beginning, was not
present, at the holding of there examinations
Â«md therefore ths phase cf the Investigation
does not concern him. but refers to the other
that ;aemberti of the board. It may be re
marked also that there were no formal charges
o; ar.y kind presented araintt the board, yet
thÂ«Â» b*"4rd offered every facility for a complete
ir.vestrgatlcn.
FTorii the evidence r-resented we do not be
lieve -that there was any conscious favoritism
' cf any pupil or class of pupils in the ex
an-.'.rAticn room, though, as shown below, cer
tain liberties given to outsiders did operate
to. the! digadvantage cf certain pupils. We
"*fcel satisfied that the board tried to maintain
ns(ipr.!n the examltiation room and to prevent
. jaJking-* and ' cribbin*." and that, until this
IlliislilslliML they believed th<>y had succeeded.
That there wis some cribbirrr, as Is apt to
J-appe'ntin any examination room, we are satls
f.'ed â lh'. t art.' that there was considerable.
â¢ We -feel certain, however, that the beard
'difi the'.! 1 -.best to prevent it. but in their care
to "watjh, â¢^rne pupil* of whom they were eus
piÂ«;ious-. they cnw:<ticgiy left opportunities to

â¢ . EVIDENCE INCONCLUSIVE.
With reference to the tlnae allowed the lden
. tlT.is.tlon cf drugs. In the examination held in
that eabject. MlsÂ« Ruby Fisher complained
that ehe did not have sufficient time to finish.
â  sind that others had mere time than Â«hÂ« did.
â Part of Ihe scholars were examined upstairs
and part downstairs. Those downstairs could
easily be seen through a skylight by any one
Â«o desiring from a pc!nt en the floor above
outside the p'ace where those upstairs were
examined. Miss Fisher did not have a watch
tj;< day she was examined In this eub'ect. and

â  Thers is eo evidence that exactly the same

Flcber end the remaining ladles who went up
stairs were examined in the'flrit relay.
The professors tvho held the examination up
stairs testified positively that the first reUy,
beisr the ladles, were really g-lven mon tlmÂ«
than they should hare been riven, to-wlt: more
than ten minutes each, while the meaVen held
down to the ten-minute rule more strictly, and
the professors downstairs " testified that every
one who desired was allowed about ten min
utes. Furthermore. Miss Fisher answered all
the Questions in Identification, and consequently
more time would have dene her little good In
that subject.
No one else made any complaint on this sub
ject, and from the evidence we are convinced
there was no intentional discrimination in this
rerard, and believe that there was no actual
discrimination in the matter of the time al
lowed to any one in this examination.
SHOW .\O FAVORITISM.
The testimony tpon the question whether
any questions had been communicated to any
favored pupil !n advance was entirely hearsay,
except the positive testimony by way of denial
that any 6ach questions had been communi
cated. Each professor claimed to have pre
pared hi* questions upon the subject in which
he examined shortly before putting them on
the blackboard, and the testimony was con
vincing that no one could have obtained infor
mation except from the professor himEelf con
ducting the examination. Dr. Crowley pre
pared his questions and handed them over to
another professor to put upon the blackboard
just before leaving for Glen Ellen, which wae
Immediately before the examination began.
Miss Alice Desponds seems to have had the
good will of some of the professors, and Pro
fessor Finger even -went so far as to assure an
inquiring pharmacist in writing, after her pa
pers had been handed In but before any an
nouncement of the result had been made, that
he would be secure In employing her. ! He ex
plained to the commission that he had suffi
cient access to the information to know that
she was going to pass, and therefore he saw
no harm in aiding her In this way to a posi
tion.
Miss Fisher testified that Mies Desponds told
her before the examination when the exam
ination in pharmacy was coming on, and that
she said Professor Finger had told her. Pro
lessor Finger thereupon made the statement to
the commission that when It was decided
among themselves (meaning the examining pro
cessors) when the pharmacy examination was
m i!L on * ,.'w was no secret . and anybody
would be at liberty to know It.
There was some hearsay testimony by Miss
TiVL rÂ£ 8 t0 . vh Â« th er Professor Flint had told
Miss Desponds Just before the examination in
pharmacy that one question would be the dif
ference between decoctions and infusions and
jun before the examination In materia medica
that one question would be the distinction be
Â£!* a Â«, coc Â° a . s - Â«<=-. and that ln\each Instance
Professor Finirer had told him.
XO CORROBORATTOX.
The attempted oorroboration went to Dleees
on cross-examination and the positive direct
testimony by Professor Finger. Professor Flint
and Miss Desponds was a denial of it all.
f^f Â° r JT 112 " te Â«lfi<Â«l to his habit of as
sembling his pupils, among whom was Miss
Desponds, in his laboratory, which was near
1011 wÂ°Â°. m - and 8 1vln <r them a final
ccachhig' just before the examination, warn
Â£*.!w1 m . Wh^ la Ws J ut5 *ment. they would
be likely to be examined in. and the commis
ilcn feels, in view of o,, positive direct testi
mony, that the hearsay testimony of Miss
Fisher on this point waa probably a misinter
pretatlcn of some statement to her by Miss
Desponds as to what took place sit these
coachings.
Whether or not there was discrimination in
making the examination papers of the April
examination could only be dMermlned conclu
sively by a comparison of the markings given
to the answers cf the various applicants. The
question* -ave been preserved in the number
ti ,^. n Fraacl Â» co *nd Pacific Druggist of
May, 13(M; no answers have been preserved
except tho?e of Miss Fisher. A relentless
questioning convinced the commission that they
had net been purposely destroyed.
The first board appointed had a custom of
preserving the answers for two years but
with the change of secretaries the custom
teems to have been discontinued altogether.
Miss FiFher did not claim that her papers had
been unfairly marked. Aa a matter cf fact,
they were fairly marked. They are exhibits
in this case, and the markings speak for them
selves. Her standing in Identifications caused
ber failure, end in that she claimed ahe did
not have enough time, as stated above.
MISS EDDY COMPLAINS.
Miss Eddy made the same complaint as to
Identifications, yet, though she and Miss Kddy
were given about the same time in the exam
ination. Miss Eddy was given another exam
ination In identification, while she was not.
The answers to Miss Eddy's second examina
tion in identification of drugs, though neces
sarily later than Miss Fisher's answers in
the first examination, were not preserved, while
Mies Fisher's were. Furthermore, without
Miss Eddy's other answers it would be impos
sible to tell whether the latter's answers were
more leniently marked than hers. The ques
tion !e Hot whether Miss Fisher was too se
verely treated In the matter of marking, for
we are convinced that she was not. but whether
MIes Eddy and others were too leniently treat
ed in this regard. In this sense, whether or
not there waa discrimination In marking the
papers could only be determined by a com
parison of the other answers and the mark
lngB. and the other answers are lost or de
stroyed.
That there was no general discrimination
against Miss Fisher we are satisfied, but
whether the hoard was warranted in giving
Mlso Eddy a second trial we have no evidence
to determine. The board preserved Miss Fista
er*s anrwers because her cousin had made a
protest In her behalf; but with a stupid want
of consistency they do not seem to have real
lied that the question of discrimination Is a
relative question, and to have afforded a com
plete proof would have necessitated a pres
erraticn of the answers of all thÂ« students.
We recomrrend that the board adopt a rule
similar to that in force In some other State
institutions, providing for the preservation of
all answers to examination papers for a rea
sonable time. .
MAKES BAD MISTAKE.
Ont mistake there was unquestionably made
by the board at the April examination. It
would appear that there is considerable rivalry
and at times some feeling between the gradu
ates of the University of California, colloquial
ly called the U. C students, and these of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons, "usually
called the P. and S. students. ' â¢â "?â .,'
Profewor Flfnt Is an Instructor in the latter
oollege and also had a number of private pu
pils whom he coached for this examination.
Professor Flint had been a former member of
the Board of Pharmacy, was - well known \ to
the present members of the beard and was
well l!V.ed by them. He asked permission to
be present at the examinations and was given
permission.
The examination took place In thÂ» Physi
cians' and Eurgeocs' College, and thÂ« board
has it* office there. Under the circumstances
It is plain from the testimony that Professor
Flint, unwittingly perhaps, abused his privi
lege. We are convinced that he did not prompt
any pupil, much less Harvey, who needed no
prompting, and that he did not give any sign
with two fingers, all of which is clear from
a reading of the evidence, but he placed him-
F*lf in a position where his every act could
be easily and naturally misunderstood %jr any
but his own pupils.
We have thoroughly investigated all cases of
admissions to practice as licentiates and as
sistants upon credentials without examination
and find that the beard has carried out tnÂ«
t-pirit of the statute in thia regard, except aa
hereinafter pointed out. The only controversy
exiftir.g was In the case of certain people ad
mitted upon credentials at the meetings of
July 16 and IS. 1801, by a former board, cf
which some of the present board were mem
bers, when Professor Searby. then a member
of the board, had a difference of opinion with
the remainder of the board as to the qualiflca-'

since eomewhat modified the Ideas upon which
he then acted.
After Professor Sfarby's resignation the
board finally agreed upon a set high standard
of requirement for admission upon credentials
without examination, which all candidates^ for
such admission matt meet, which has been.re
duced to writing and the document containing

discretion of this course is obvious. ,
PRACTICE CAUSES FRICTION.
There has been considerable friction and
complaint concerning the practice of the board
frith reference to the provisions of the statute
concemlr-r the payment' of fees for renewal
of registration. Section 6 of the pharmacy
act. atccr.g ether thing*, provides: "Every
registered pharmacist who desires to continue
the practice v of â  his. rraf eÂ»s!on - in .-. this State

the board, but which shall in no case exceed
the sum of two ($2) dollars, per annum, for
which he shall receive a renewal of said regis
tration." â  â¢ . .
The statute contains a similar provision for
the renewal of the registration of an assistant
at one dollar per annum. It Is the duty of thÂ«
board to enforce this provision and, of course,
to collect all arrearages. Frequent complaint
ha* been made, however, that . where a per
son has once been registered as a pharmacist
and has left the State, or has for a time
ceased to continue practicing his profession
as a pharmacist within the State and returns
to the practice of his profession after a num
ber of years, the board still exacts a payment
of the full arrearage of |2 a year for the
entire period of such absence or failure to
practice before they will grant -him a renewal
of registration without examination. It will
be noted that, under the terms of the statute,
the renewal fee is for those continuing the
practicing of their profession and for the pro
tection of the provision of the law enjoyed by
those thus continuing- the practice of their pro
fession.
Where one discontinues the practice of his
profession for a while, however, and does not
for the time being receive any benefit from
the law. it is hard to see how, under such
circumstances, such a collection can be called
an arrÂ»arÂ»ijre. The word "arrearage" In such
a casÂ» would appear somewhat In the nature
of a euphonlsm for the word "penalty." We
recommend that the board should apply to
the Attorney General's office to obtain an
opinion upon the question whether ; the terms
of the statute are broad enough to cover such
a practice and *we are of the opinion, no mat
ter what may be ultimately found to be the
scope of that statute, that such a practice is
Injudicious and unjustifiable. -
FEE IS FAVORED.
Another matter to which ' the attention of
your commission was called was the rule
adopted by the board requiring five dollars to
accompany all applications and affidavits for
registration and the practice of the board in
retaining the fee whether the application was
granted cr denied. There was some irritation
and comment as a result of this practice, be
cause when first put Into effect the applicant
had no notice that his money would not be
returned if his application was unsuccessful.
Among other*. Professor Searby severely criti
clied this practice. Some time after Professor
Searbv resigned from the board, however, the
board had a notice printed on all their appli
cation blanks, so that for a long time past all
applicants have had full - notice where â  they
have had access - to. the . board's I application
blanks and to that extent criticism arising
from want of notice has been avoided.'
It happens sometimes that the money ac
companies a letter -of inquiry, where the ap
plicant has had no blank, and. therefore, no
notice, and In such a case. a- retention ,of tha
money is ant to be misunderstood. Since the
adoption of. a fixed standard by the board
tn cues cf applications for registration 'upon
credentials â¢without examination the matter of
determining whether such an application should
be granted is a very simple one '-and we are
of the opinion that | where such application is
now denied the fee should be returned.- .In
all cares, where the application necessitates
the holding of an examination of the applicant,
however, we feel that' the fee should be re
tained by the board whether the. applicant 1Â«
successful or not. ; . . u\ ',i. â >-... .* .

place several times before. She was on
the watch last "Wednesday night, .and
when she saw Lee passing her door she
pointed ' him out to a policeman . who
took him In charge. ' Mrs. Vallade iden
tified him positively and produced two
witnesses who also identified him as the
man : who : had passed the bad note.-- -
Eee admits having? bought things in
the store several times and says he
once changed a five-dollar bill there,
but never a ten-dollar note. He has

Men' of lioad Expeditiously
Answer Call to Eelieve
a Brother in Distress
Good nature and fraternal considera
tion was a conspicuous feature of the
convention of the California Division
of the Travelers' Protective Associa
tion held, at Golden Gate Hall yester
day.. It was announced that a fellow
member was lying ill at his home and
had, indeed, been seriously indisposed
for some time. Quick as a flash a
substantial collection was taken up
without quibble, question or any de
sire to form a committee of Investiga
tion. It was sufficient for the travelers
to. know that one of their number was
sorely -stricken.
E. W. Do nlam of Cincinnati, former
national president and national organ
izer,' said he was impelled to commend
the, sentiment and lofty feeling that
prompted' the members to act without
delay. -He had never seen or heard
of "suffering without finding the trav
eler: <Â»ager to give what aid was in his
power/ He was ever ready to lessen
the trouble of a brother. The speaker
therefore ~took occasion to express the
fullest appreciation of the fraternal
spirit that existed in the organization.
Donlam himself handed a handsome
contribution to the cause.
Supervisor Fred Eggers, president of
the â¢ association for 1904,* was In the
chair and the proceedings were spirited,
particularly as to concessions derived
from the Southern Pacific Company on
mileage books and in regard to bag
gagecof traveling men.
-Donlam- explained that the matter of
concessions was in the hands of F. W.
Crandall; chairman of the association's
national railroad committee. Harry T.
Moorej jjj chairman of the railroad and
transportation committee, reported that
Crandall had recently called on Presi
dent Roosevelt, to whom he submitted
the' association's proposed amendment
to the. interstate commerce law. The
President had assured him that the
amendment met with his approval.
: Moore \ further said that if carried
the amendment would make the Inter
state Commerce Commission a positive
instead of a negative body and give the
commission full and specific authority
to. compel the railroads to abide by
the law. .
â  The election of officers resulted in
the choice of George W. Geaugue for

PROCTOR AND SON
ARE IN JAIL.
Mnist Answer for Grand Larceoy
AGED WIDOW OF NILES AND THE ALLEGED SWINDLER WHO HAS BEEN |
HELD FOR TRIAL BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT ON CHARGES OF
GRAND LARCENY PREFERRED J BY VICTIM OF HIS SMOOTH TONGUE. \'
OAKLAND, Dec. 29.â "Doctor" Wil
liam S. Proctor and his stepson, Roy
W. Asberry. who are accused by Mrs.
Emiline Tyson of stealing from her two
valuable diamond rings and $10S in
cash, were held to answer in the Supe
rior Court to-day on charges of grand
larceny.
. Judge Sandholdt of Centerville set the
bail in each case at $2000, and in de
fault of this sum the prisoners were
brought to the County Jail to await
trial.
Evidence introduced at the prelimin
ary examination tor-day showed that
the defendants conspired to defraud
Mrs. Tyson after meeting hir at the
Niles depot. It was shown that Proc
tor and Asberry made inquiries aa to
Mrs. Tyson's plaice of residence and
made notes regarding her family, age
and circumstances.
Mrs. Tyson was the first witness
called to-day, being cross-examined by
Attorney Tom Bradley. The defense
failed to shake the â¢ testimony of the
aged plaintiff in any important particu
lar, Mrs._Tyson stating each fact clear
ly and without hesitation. The only ad
mission made by the plaintiff was that
at the time Proctor took the rings she
did not tell her sons, because she feared
to let them know that she had trusted
a comparative stranger with her Jewels.
Only once did Mrs. Tyson become ex
cited, and this was when Bradley
asked: "Is it not a fact,. Mrs. Tyson,
that when Proctor called at your, house
on Sunday morning you knew he was
a married man?"
Turning upon the attorney Mrs. Ty
son said: "No such thing ever entered
my head until I read it, in the news
papers. Had I ever dreamed of such a
thing this man should never have
spoken to me as he did."
Asked if she had considered herself
engaged to Proctor, she replied:
"I did."
On redirect examination Mrs. Tyson
said that Proctor called at her house
five times, / accompanied each time by
Asberry. Witness said further that the
"doctor" had always represented that
Asberry was his son, and had intro
duced him to Mrs. Tyson as Mr.
Proctor.
William H. Tyson, a son of the plain
tiff, .was called and testified that he was
present at the arrest of? Proctor, but
knew little of the circumstances lead
ing up to the trouble. â¢ .
The .next, witness called was David
Tyson,- who told the following story: -
I first saw Proctor and Asberry at my
mother's house on Sunday morning, December
18. When I reached the house my mother and
Proctor were in the bedroom, leaning over the
bed, and as I reached the door I heard ' some
Jewelry rattle. A moment later Proctor came
out and. after speaking a few words to me
left the house.
I next saw both the defendants at my moth
er's house about 4 o'clock on Sunday after
noon. I saw them go to the bouse and I went
over and asked Proctor what was the meaning
of so many visits to my ' mother. I told him
I did not like his actions and said that I be
lieved hÂ« was crooked. Ha answered. "Why,
I love your mother." I answered, "It is very
strange . that a man of your age should . fall
In love with an old woman like her," and he
said: "Did you never foil in love at first
sight 7" After some further talk I told them
that they had better leave, which they did.
Miss Mary Nichols, a domestic em
ployed at . Mrs. Tyson's home, testified
that she first met the defendents at the
Niles depot about 8 o'clock on- Friday
morning, December 16. She said that
Proctor and Mrs. Tyson had some con
versation, -and, that . after Mrs. Tyson
had taken the train for Oakland, Proc
tor asked her a number of questions as
to where Mrs. Tyson lived and who she
was. ',' â¢. ' Â«" -
On ' cross-examination Miss Nichols
said that Proctor ' asked' her, , not
to .mention â¢- anything that passed
between them r and that she promised
she would not.
Miss Emeline Tyson, a granddaughter
of the plaintiff, testified that she met
the defendants at Mrs. Tyson's home on
several occasions. She said Proctor
told her that Asberry was his son,
and that he was a physician, practicing
at the Women and Children's Hospital
in San Francisco.
Miss Tyson's testimony concluded the
hearing.
Judge Sandholdt then ordered the de
fendants held to answer in the Supe
rior Court.
The defendants will be examined be
fore Judge Sandholdt at Centerville on
Wednesday, January 4, on the second
charge of grand larceny for the al
leged stealing of $108 in cash from Mrs.
Tyson.
COLORED LAD
STABS MAIDEN
Ten-Year-Old Yoiingster In*
flicts Wound Upon Girl
Who Aroused His Anger
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Dec. 29.
Charged with stabbing a young white
girl In the neck with his pocketknife,
little Wendell Griffin, a 10-year-old col
ored lad, -stood with tear-stained face
before Justice of the Peace Edgar to
day, fearful that his fate would be of
such seriousness as commonly befalls
malefactors caught red-handed in the
act.
; The- youth used hls 4 knife on ilary
lielms, a- 14-year-old girl, as they qua*r
reled in front of 'the Helms home, at
1615 Oregon street, South Berkeley, last
night. He declares that Mary Helms
attacked his little sister and that he
simply Hew to his sister's relief.
"Ah had mah pocketknife â  in th'
hand," said the colored lad to ' Justice
I Edgar this morning as he faced the
court, "and it ' cut her, I guess, but I
didn't never. know she was hurt till she
screamed. I didn't, mean to. hurt her-r
sure 1 didn't."
The girl was not Injured save for a
slight scratch where the knife blade
had penetrated her clothing, but her
parents believed formal ' complaint
should be made of young Griffin's reck
lessness. Accordingly Deputy Marshall
Pickett took the youthful offender into;
court.
"No formal complaint was entered
against the lad and he was released on
his own recognizance. Justice Edgar
will sit in the Juvenile court next
Wednesday," and at that time Griffin
will come before him for a hearing.

CONTRA COSTA
ASKED TO BID
Council Invites the Water
Company to Submit Its
Figures by Next Tuesday
NEW DEAL IS NOW ON
Bay Cities Proposition to
Supply City Will Be
Considered Without Delay
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec 29.
The City Council this evening ex
tended an invitation to the Contra
Costa Water Company to submit a
figure at which it would be willing to
sell out its plant to the people of Oak
land.. This offer is to be submitted by
next Tuesday . evening, at which time
the Council meets to consider the Bay
Cities . proposition to supply the city
with a competing system.
The resolution was Introduced by
Councilman McAdam, who thought the
Contra Costa Company should be given
at least two weeks in which to submit
its bid. It was the general opinion of
the other members that this was too
long a time and would delay the work
and that the company already knows
what its plant is worth and can do it
just as well in two days as in two
weeks.
Councilman Aitken opposed making
any overture to the Contra Costa Com
pany and in this connection said: "If
you want to kill this proposition you
will begin dealing with the Contra
Costa Company. I believe that is just
a scheme to delay and take the matter
before Tinother Council. Mr. Dlneee has
had ample opportunity to submit an
offer and I do not believe that we
should have anything to do with him."
QUARREL OVER
FAMILY SILVER
Mr. and Mrs. Barrie Wrangle
in Court for Possession
of Household Treasures
Berkeley OiFce San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, Dec. 29.
Treasures of the family household
that once had been shared in common
between Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Bar
lie were the subject of bitter dispute
to-day in Justice Edgar's court during
the trial of Mrs. Barrie's action,
brought to recover possession of fam
ily silver," pictures, furniture and books
which, she declares, her husband is re
taining without right at his home on
Fulton street.
Spoons, dishes, bric-a-brac, old
books, hymnals, poems and much of
the sort of stuff that households ac
cumulate and hold dear because of
associations rather than for intrinsic
worth were coldly appraised by experts
on the stand, while lawyers represent
ing the warring parties wrangled over
the values set by these experts. .
"This 'Golden Treasure of , Song,' "
said Attorney Church to an expert,
"you say is worth 'steen dollars. Now
is it not a matter of fact that it could
be bought fcr dollars, and that no
such value as you give it could be col
lected if It were sold?"
Thus down the line, even to a Moody
and Sankey hymnal, went the argu
ment, over those things which were col
lected by Mr. and Mrs. Barrie during a
married life of many years, but which
now they take into court, where the
Judge is to sit as a Solomon, dividing
what were once treasures dear to both
and held by both.
Mr3. Barrie sues for $299, represent
ing, as she says, the value of the stuff
retained by her husband. . The action
is a sequel to the divorce proceedings
of the pair. She makes he"r husband's
niece and nephew, Margaret and Ed
win Wade, codefendants with her hus
band.
When she sued for divorce a year ago
she accused Barrie of bringing Misa
Wade from the East here and keeping
her in the Barrie home against the
wife's wishes. She alleged that the
moral atmosphere of the home made
it an unfit place to rear the Barries'
daughter. Judge Ogden denied -her a
divorce. Sv^i
Barrie then began suit for divorce,
charging cruelty. His wife came back
with a cross-complaint, alleging adul
tery. The case Is pending in the courts'
of Alameda County.

21. Center street, Dec 29.
News has Just come from Oxford.
England, that William Clark Critten
den, the Rhodes scholar from Califor
nia, has been made stroke of the first
Trinity Toga. This is the most impor
tant position in the boat and practi
cally its captain. It is very remark
attte for a freshman to win such an im
portant position, and It has not been
done - for many years. Heretofore the
place has been given only to one who
had rowed for , several years beforo
coming to Oxford. Many old oarsmen
tried for stroke. "Most of the Rhodes
scholars rowing are from Canada.
South Africa, Australia and America,
and Crittenden' s work is the best that
has been done by any . of them.
Previously to this Crittenden acted
as * stroke -. in the freshman boat - and
won a silver oar and the challenge
cup to keep for a year.- This cup has
the names of the winning stroke en
graved upon it for many years back.
It was on account of his coolness and
good Judgment as -well as his skillful
handling of the boat that won Critten
den ' this enviable honor.

HEIRS WEARY
OF FIGHTING
Offer of Compromise in the
Matter of Eleanor More
\ Estate Ends, Litigation
MUST PAY HEAVY TAX
Legatees of the Late Million
\ air'e S. T. Alexander Sub
ject to Impost of $5250
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Dec. 29.
Tired of- prolonging litigation, the
heirs of the late Eleanor H. More have
agreed to divide $5000 among Mrs. Cor
nelia A. Baldwin and Mrs. Eliza Miller,
sisters of the deceased, and Martha Dxx
val, a niece. These three were disin
herited and have kept- up & fight for
four years. In order to make- sure- of
something they have agreed to i settle
for this sum, and Jtshn F. More and P.
W. Watson, to whom was left the bulk
of an $SO,000 estate, are willing. to give
it to them. â¢
Eleanor H. More during her lifetime
lived at Berkeley and by her will gave
her brother all of her property, with
the exception of a bequest of $10,000 to
Watson. The sisters and niece contest
ed and the trial went so far as the
hearing of their evidence, when a non
suit was granted. Much family bitter
ness was brought out and recrimina
tion indulged, in.
By the report of the appraiser of the
collateral inheritance tax in the case
of the heirs of the late Samuel T. Alex
ander it is shown that the brothers,
sisters, neDhews and niece of the late
millionaire must pay $5250 tax upon
their bequests. William D., James 'SI.,
Henry M., Mary J. and Charlotte Alex
ander and Mrs. Annie Dickey received
$15,000 each by the will, while to Charles
F. Alexander, William G. Cooke and
Helen A. Alexander- $5000 apiece was
left. The bequests amount to $105,000,
on which the tax is due. The entire es
tate is valued at $1,040,000.
Charles C. Dean, Mrs. Emily Dean
Allen and James B. Dean have asked
for a partial distribution of their moth
er's estate, valued at $85,000, and want
$23,000 distributed to each of them at
the present time... â¢ â

MEN ON RIHLUNG HILL
Capture Forty-Three Russian Guns Manned by the
Garrison of the Fort.
Rihluns: fort, which the Japanese have enptured, is situated on Rihlung Slountain and formed part of
Uic Innrr circle or the chain of forts defending Port Arthur. Rihluns is about two miles from the outskirts
of the town of Port Arthur, from which it bears northeastward. Tlie fort just caÂ»>tui-ed is a mile and a half
southeast of Keckwan fort, recently captured by the Japanese. The possession of these two forts should
make an ini{x>rtant breach in the fortifications of Port Arthur and cut oft* communication between the Gold
en HJII forts and the forts of the western section of the inner circle of fortifications..
Outside the capture of 203-Meter Hill on the western section .of ; forts, little, is known of the exact po
sitions occupied by the Japanese, but it would Â«eem from the material. a vailable that the inner circle of
forts is now cut in three pieces, and tliat 203-Meter Hill prohibits communication with the Liaoti section
forts., just as possession of IUhlnnc and Keckwan forts cuts off communication with the Golden Hill forts,
except by the many underground ways wiiich are said to exist In various parts- of the fortress.
From RlbJuns Mountain, which is nearly opposite 203-Meter Hill, it would a'â car that the Japanese
fire will be able to reach anything in the harbor and town. which the Japanese heavy guns on 203-Meter Hill
are unable to hit, thus making it apparently impossible for the Russian second Pacific squadron to make any
use of Port Arthur, even should the Japanese content themselves with holding the strong i>ositioi:s they now
occupy. . . â¢
TOIfclO. Dec. SO. â The Japanese j
captured forty-three gruns when the I
Rlhlung fort was taken.
The headquarters of the army be- j

" the night of December -S. after the oc
cupation of Rih'.ung fort, a small body
of Russians still offered resistance in j
\fc<Â» passage between the eiege gun line j
and the gorge. At 3 o'clock in the
* rr.orr.fng they were dislodged entirely
e.n<5 the occupation of the fort became
secure, f^
According to the statement of three
prisoners, the defenders of Fort Rih
lung numbered about 503 soldiers, be
* fides some sailors. A majority of the j
drfer.dera were killed.
The trophies captured with Fort Rih

ANESE ARMY BEFORE PORT AR
." THUR, Dec. C9.â Rihlung fort was
captured at 3 o'clock this morning,
with 1000 Japanese casualties. Seven
j dynamite mines exploded at 10 o'clock
" jvsterday made breaches in the front
wall through which a large body of
JaT>anese charged under cover of a tre
mendous bombardment and captured
I the first line of light guns. A bitter
-'figrhrt resulted in the capture of the fort.
The garrison, numbering 500 men, es
caped.
TOKIO. Dec. 25.â After* months of
fighting, sapping and mining, the Jap
anese forces finally occupied Rihlung
Mountain early this morning.
A" report from headquarters of the
Third Japanese army beft/re Port Ar
thur received here yesterday at mid
night said:
* "On Wednesday. December 2?, at 10
o'clock m the morning, the left center
column of our army, following some
heavy explosions on the frontal parapet
of Rihlung Mountain, charged and oc
cupied the parapet under caver of fire
from heavy guns, and constructed de
fense works, despite the enemy's fierce
-fire.
"At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, when
.our ofrupation was practically assured,
v.e charged and occupied the inner lines
*of heavy gun positions, subsequently
dislodging a remnant of the enemy's
f^rce stubbornly holding the gorge fort,
' which we occupied, and captured the
entire works."

Imperial headquarters to-day pub
â¢lished'a list of casualties, presumably
"*at Port Arthur, which includes forty
nine officers, from colonel downward,
killed, and fifty-eight officers, from col
onel downward, wounded.
ClfEFU, Dec. 29.â The Japanese line
.at "Port Arthur is now, as a result of
the general attack which was begun on
December 25. much closer to Liaotl
Mountain. Chinese who left Port Ar
"'thur yesterday and arrived here to-day
report that a greatly inferior Russian
force defended the outermost of the
trenches for three days, retiring when
the Japanese artillery' had gained an
enfilading position. The fighting mostly
was at a range of two-thirds of a mile,
the Japanese fearing mines. The Rus
sians retired to Chingkakao.
Japanese who arrived at Chefu to
â¢ day from Port Dalny say the recent
fighting also resulted in the capture of
a hill called by the Japanese Yangthu
ban fpossibly Keekwan Mountain), en
abling the Japanese to seriously harass
land communication with the Liaotl
forts and with the forts on Etze and
Antze mountains. The capture of Yang

Don't fret the Ta-ong idea Into your

pepsla.
It's not. i;-
Those irho have not studied the sub-
ject very, deeply, or with trained scien-

But facts prove otherwise.
All specialists in stomach and diges-

dyspepair* to be well fed.

disease!
Tour food doesn't feed you.
By starvation, you may give your

No. the only right way to permanent-
ly cure yourself of any form of dyspep-
sia or indigestive trouble. Is to eat
heartily of all the food that you find
best agrees with you. and help your
â digestion to work with Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets.
This is a safe, certain, scientific, re-
liable method of treatment, which will
never fail to cure the most obstinate

gentle, tonic, refreshing effect on the

They gently force the flow of fresh

They contain, themselves, many of

They, therefore quickly relieve all the
symptoms of indigestion, and coax the
glands to take a proper pleasure in do-

They coax you back to health.

STEAMSHIPS RUX BLOCKADE.
The Japanese here further report that
severs fighting has occurred on the
northeast flank, particularly at Rihluug
Mountain, where, when the- Japanese
left Port Dalny, the Japanese forces
had made some progress. Details of thisi
fighting have not yet reached Chefu.
Two steamships recently ran the

NOTED SLAV SCOUT KILLED.
Cumin Eldaroff Loses His Life hi At
tack on Japanese. Village.
MUKDEN, Dec. 29.â Cossacks to-day
brought in the body of Captain Erlda
roff, a noted scout, who was killed in an
attack on the village of TIfanty.
Intense hatred exists between some
of the opposing forces In trenches close
together notwithstanding the friendly
relations at other parts on the fronts of
the two armies. The. Japanese try to
heat their shelters at advanced posi
tions with charcoal -fires concealed" in
small braziers, so as to show no light.
One of these recently was broken and
the flre exposed the position of the
Japanese party. The whole party was
immediately annihilated by a furious
Russian flre.
There was a sharp skirmish. on De
cember 28 at Slnchinpu. A concealed
mortar battery inside the Russian lines
opened on the Japanese position, driv
ing out a number of the Japanese, who
sought refuge among the trees and
bushes. A shell exploded a Japanese
mine In front of the trenches, inflicting
considerable damage.
The Russian batteries are connected
by telephone and report the result of
one another's flre. Recently a field bat
tery posted on heights caught a detach
ment of Japanese and drove them â¢ all
out of their trenches In the immediate
front.
Irrefutable evidence has been ob
tained at headquarters that the Japa
nese are not only hiring Chinese bandits
to or>erate on the Russian flanks, but
that they are enlisting Chinese under
Japanese officers.
The JaDanese are adopting cunning
expedients to defeat the surprise at
tacks of the Russian scouts, from which
they have suffered much. They cover
the steep approaches of their trenches
with water, which freezes, forms ice
slides and makes the scouts slip and
fall In confusion. In other places the
Japanese scatter millet stalks over the
approaches, the crackling of which
gives them warning of the presence of
Russian scouts.

TOKIO, Dec. 29, noon.â Manchurlan
army headquarters reporting to-day
said:
"On December 27 at 3 o'clock in the
afternoon the Russians with heavy field
guns bombarded the Shakhe River rail
road bridge In the neighborhood of the
station, and the Russian guns at Ta
lientun shelled Chlhsiangtun and Shu
â¢Untzu. Russian cavalry also attacked
Helllntun at sunset on the same day,
but was repulsed by Japanese cavalry.
At 8:30 o'clock on the same evening the
Russian cavalry enveloped the Japa
nese pickets, who were reinforced and
finally repulsed the enemy. The Japa
nese casualties were three men killed."
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, Dec. 29. â The Russians continue
a daily bombardment, firing at random
and causing few casualties. The Japa
nese soldiers pick up fifteen-centimeter
shrapnel cases and with them make
charcoal burners to heat the bomb
proofs. Occasional collisions take place
between patrols, the Russians always
retiring. Both sides seem satisfied to
remain in the trenches.

PELEM IS A PRISONER.
Russian Officer Captured on Blockade
Runner Is Identified.
6HAXGHAI, Dec. 29. â According to
private advices from Sasebo received
to-day Commander Pelem of the Rus
sian torpedo-boat destroyer Rasto
rojmy and another officer of that ves
sel have been identified among those
on board the captured British steam
ship Nigretia.
The Nigretia. which left Shanghai,
bound for Vladivostok, and alleged to
have a cargo of contraband of war, was
captured by the Japanese protected
cruiser Tsushima off Ulsan, Korea, on
December 19. The vessel was taken
to Sasebo, where she is now under
going examination.
A dispatch from Shanghai on De
cember- 18 said it was reported that
Commander Pelem had escaped from
that port on the Xigretia, accom
panied bj' others belonging to the Ras
toropny. The Rastoropny had escaped
frcm Port Arthur with dispatcher and
rtcched Chefu on November 16 and
on that day was blown up by her
crew. Officers and crew were subse
quently taken to Shanghai and turned
over to' the care^of the Russian Con
sul there.
A dispatch from Shanghai on De
cember 20 said there appeared to be
no doubt that the commander of.
the Russian torpedo-boat destroyer
Grozovoi, which has been at Shang
hai since the battle off Port Arthur
on August 10, was on board the Ni
gretia and that he carried valuable
charts and documents.
DELAYS NORTH SEA INQUIRY.
Russia's Recall of Kasenakoft* Causes
Surprise in Paris. ;.
PARIS, Dec. 29. â The members of
the International commission on the
Ncrth Sea incident were surprised to
day to hear that Admiral Kasenakoff,
the Russian member, had been re
called, as no intimation that a change
was contemplated had been communi
cated to the commission. The dis
patch from St. Petersburg announcing
the change was laid before Admiral
Kasenakoff to-night with a request for
a statement. The admiral declined to
discuss the matter.
The retirement of Admiral Kasen
akoff causes much comment here. It
is conjectured that it is due to re
newed naval activity in Russia In
connection with the possible jdispatch
of a third squadron to the Far East,
as Kasenakoff ranks as a full admiral
and therefore has seniority over
Skrydloff and Rojestvensky, com
manders of the first and second Pacific
squadrons. It is also suggested that
Great Britain and other Governments
having sent vice or rear admirals to
s't on the commission, Russia deems it
not necessary that she should be rep
resented by an officer of highest rank.

IRRIGATI0NISTS
NOW AT PEACE
Long Legal Battle Over
flight to Use Waters of
Kern River Is at an End
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 29.â By an
agreement entered into to-day between
the representatives of Miller & Lux and
other irrigating Interests of the Kern
Valley and the Kern River Company
the injunction issued several months
ago restraining the latter company
from diverting the waters of Kern
River at Kernvllle was dissolved,
and to-night telephone Instructions
have gone from this city to the power
plant, sixty miles distant, to turn the
water Into the big canal.
The wheels of the power plant will
be .turning on Friday, and by ; the. first
of the year the street car lines In Los
Angeles will be propelled by the power
generated by the waters of Kern River.
By the terms of the negotiations
through which the legal proceedings
were stopped the Kern River Company
has .the privilege to use the waters of
the river under the agreement that the
water shall be returned to the river
channel undiminished in quantity. To
be able to meet this requirement some
three months .ago . the power company
began the i wortr of cementing each
ditch for its entire length of twelve
miles. This labor was completed last
week, and with the legal formalities of
to-day nothing remains but to open the
headgates and start in motion one of
the most extensive power plants of the

THE ENGINEERS' REPORT.
np*HE f^Il text of the engineers' report on the river problem is
I .-. Dot yet ptiblisherL The synopsis that is given oat :s st^Hcient
'>j ; to serve za the basis of 2. jndj^ent npon the plan proposed- It
i* the levee r/.^r.. Levee* are to be constructed abotit 2000 feet apart
to *erve a* flood banks for the Sacramento. These are to extend
froci the trpper flood point to Collinsville. They will cross and close
tfce ranees tfcxrghs or bayoms which now take the flood and spread
it fÂ»y.tr the country, some into the San Joaquin River and some over
the tend. The object is to confine the whole flood betweeen these
artificial banks and discharge it and the silt it carries at Collinsville,
v/hrre the Sacramento and San Joaqnin join, and their combined
current will cirry the silt forv/ard.
Jht plan has this merit, that if it hi found that a flood is too
great for this rVnrnedhrte carriage to the bay the operation of flood
basins may be made an adjtrnct to ft. While there are differences
of o^i.vlcri aa to the Isvee system zs operated on the Mississippi, it
mc<.t L* remembered that the flood stretches of the Sacramento are
nrtich shorter, and if it be fotzxid that the fail of the river is not sufn
der.t to sectire a satisfactory scouring of the channel, the pump
dredge may be economically used to transfer the deposit to raise the
IeveÂ«% or to raise the Irrw places outside.
The co5,t of the plan is p-ut at $23,000,000, and the land, now un
used, which it will reclaim, is estimated at 1,000,000 acres. That is
only S23: ptr acre, which is the average cost of tule land reclamation
on the two rivers. It is expected that the State and- Federal govern
ments may combine in paying for this work. It is entirely feasible,
an*i as a last resort Loth governments can join in assessing the cost
to the land reclaimed, just as the Federal government gets back from
the owners of irrigated land the cost of the plant which reclaims it
irotn the' desert.
. For rr.zr.y yezr% many plans have been considered, some have
beÂ«n- tried and all have been abandoned for this river rectification.
Tfashas been because of the lack of substantial co-operation. The
T>fe*Â£!e immediately concerned have differed and disagreed, and in
the presence of their conflict of opinion the rest of t'.ie people of the
State have maintained an attitude of unconcern. N'ow let us have
&(rstantiaJ zrA hearty agreement and an energetic and cheerful co
operjaixm and get this last plan in operation. Xo doubt much econ-
can be used in the work. In many places the pump dredge may
;?.fce the existing deposit out of the river and utilize it in building the
jevec by confining it between sheep piling, which will reduce the
CttJ*fic yard ost of the artificial banks and at the -same time relieve the
channel and increase the carrying capacity of the stream without
wk'itfng on the slower scouring process.
The work will probably begin at the lower end, as a beginning
at the upper would disuse the flood basins and send the whole flood
\o\nmc <iown to the lower reaches, where it would obliterate existing
reclamations. Of course care will be taken to avoid thrpwing floods
to one side or the other during construction at points where great
damage would be caused.
Our members of Congress are In hearty accord in the effort to
fcer.tirc Federal aid, and ther.e are 'so many ways in which the burden
of th<r work can be lightened by distributing" it that they should be
able to show that we have as much right to Federal assistance on
our shorter river as the greatrr number of States have on the long
M&sl^sippL California land is of too much importance to make its
disuse a matter of no concern to the State or the nation.
â¢ It will be noticed that the engineers' report confirms The Call's
*latipment that hydraulic mining is not wholly blameworthy in the
.inaitcr, as there were great floods before it was known or used. The
silt carried by the flood water of rivers increases with the erosion of
cultivated lands. Wherever flood water is permitted to flow over
plowed fields it gathers the soil and carries it finally into the river
channel, which it raises, with a corresponding rise in the flood plane.
The proposed levees will keep the water off tilled lands and will
finally reduce the amount of silt carried by the stream.
There arc indications of opposition to the engineers' plan in sec
tions of the State remote from the scene of the river problem. The
Miner-Transcript, in Nevada County, has already indicated its oppo
sition. Hut General Green of the Colusa Sun, an engineer and one
of tht best observers of the river in the State, says to that paper: "We
think our contemporary has a pretty good understanding of the sub
ject, and as a man who understands a subject can take the wrong
Ride and make a pretty good fight, we are anxious that our friend
â¢hall not get himself committed until he knows he is right. We do
want 'to f,ec our mountain contemporary in a frame of mind that will
enable him to look at things without putting on his smoked glasses."
That is the proper spirit, and we join the Sun in hoping that the
press of the State will consider the extreme necessity of our fellovv
.citi/ens who are in reach of the floods, and will not hastily condemn
a remedy that may prove a complete solution of the great problem.
Thr Call stands for the interests of all and feels that the symmetrical
development of the State makes for the prosperity of all the people
rÂ»f the commonwealth.
COMPULSORY ARBITRATION.
EX-SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN W. FOSTER, president
of the National Arbitration Conference and one of the leaders
of the international peace movement in this country, has con-Â»
tnbuted some interesting thoughts on the progress of the arbitration
I'lca in a recently published monograph upon "Arbitration and The
Hague Court." Especially noteworthy is his prognostication of the
.-â¢rm-ndments to the existing arbitration convention which are likely
uybe madr by the. second peace conference called into session by
'resident Roosevelt.
Foster believes that compulsory arbitration, sanctioned by all the
; <nvcrs signatory to the arbitration convention of 1899, is the inev
itable outcome of tendencies now being manifested by international
â¢K,-ace pacts. Under the joint compact signed by the nations at The
Hague recourse to the international arbitration court there estab
lished is made optional only; the allied powers are empowered to
bring to bear only the weight of their "good offices" in a dispute bc
lwccn nations which seems to be beyond the power of diplomatic so
lution. The weight of the world's opinion alone is made the sole
inspiration for the submission of international tangles to The Hague
court instead of to the arbitrament of war. The signal inadequacy
of this tentative provision is now finding its terrible demonstration in
the Far Eastern struggle.
Because Holland and Denmark and Argentina and Chile have
included treaties making an appeal to the arbitration court obli
gatory in all disputes between the several contracting parties, with
the sole reservation in favor of questions concerning the indepen
dence of one of them, Foster urges that the present arbitration trea
ties being engaged in between our country and several other nations
'In not go far enough. The Anglo-French treaty of last year, which
is supposed to be the model for similar pacts between the United
States and other powers, limits the obligation to submit to The
Hague court solely to matters concerning interpretation of existing
treaties or disputes of a judicial order.
It must be evident to the minds of even the most ardent sup
porters of the international arbitration movement that the great
nowcrs have not yet advanced far enough in the humanitarian ideas
inculcated by the first peace conference to accept the radical interpre
'.ntion of fifth-rate nations as their standard. The interests of .Great
' Vitain and the United States are not those jof Denmark or Argentina,
or can they be set to the rules inaugurated by 'tlujse minor states'
Oojnpulsory arbitration is an ideal, but an ideal still far in the horizon
of things practical. Meanwhile the world may count itself very well
satisfied that arbitration treaties such as those now being engaged
in by the leading powers have been made possible by the broadening
tolerance of humanity.

calmly. "In one breath you say one

Now, what do you really mean?"
She tax down to wait for the kettle

Darcy sat alone, therefore, and ate
a p&rt of his lunch. He did not drink
his tea â for he could not touch the
pretty cup that she offered him daily
with so much grace. He stared at the
blank wall and imagined Jeanette in
the softly lighted dining-room of the
great hotel. He knew the Junior part
ner would take her to a . fashionable
place. That was one thing in his favor
â he was not ashamed to be feen with
his typewriter. But It was the first
time that Jeanette had gone.
"And it won't be the last,** groaned
poor Darcy. with his bead on his desk.
"Yes it will," aald a soft voice behind
him, and be whirled around to see
Jeanette, all smiles and blushes, fresh
as a rose.
"HÂ« asked me to marry him,** shÂ»
aaid without farther remark.
Darcy's head dropped down on his
desk.
Silence.'
Then in the stillness came the "cllck
ety, clickety-cllck" of Jeanette's type
writer. Darcy raised his head and
picked up his pencil desperately. He
might as well begin. Same old routine,
same old work, same old struggle, and
now Jeanette would be out of tt,
whirled into a gay life by the riches of
the junior partner, and he would be
alone â alone.
The typewriter was silent, and he
heard the whirr of paper being pulled
out, and then Miss Melton's step as
she crowed thÂ»> room. She laid a sheet
of paper In front of him. On It was
neatly typed, "But I refused him."
Darcy caught both of her hands in
his.
"Oh, Jeanette, Jeanette," he cried
rapturously. "Why did you "do it? Why
did ycu refuse a rich man like that?"
"Because," said Jeanette demurely,
"I'd rather make your tea."
"At the office or in our home, dear?"
"Both," said little Jeanette.â

of the affair was the singing of "O.

CAP AND BELLS
CLUB'S YULETIDE
ENTERTAINMENT
The first annual Yuletlfie entertain
ment under the auspices of the Cap
and Bells Club drew a select assem
blage yesterday afternoon to the So
rosis Club on^Californla street. The
programme was an attractive one
and was strictly an old time colonial
affair. It was rendered under the di
rection of Mrs. W. P. Buckingham,
and all the members present were
robed in old colonial gowns in keep
ing with the rest of the entertain
ment.
The decorations were also colonial
and the pretty clubrooms resembled
one of the houses of luxury during the
revolutionary days. Mrs. Bucking
ham read an original colonial ro
mance in verse entitled "Grandma's
Reveille." It was the story of a woman
heroine of the Revolution, whose hus
band and three sons were fighting for
the freedom of t"heir country. Mrs.
Buckingham pictured the leading
character as a noble woman and
scored a great hit when she recited
the piece.
The rest of- the programme consist
ed of "Wit and Humor," by several
club members; "Ye Old Time Quad

MISTY'S PRIDE IS BEATEN A NECK BY DAINTY IN A HARD DRIVE
BRONZE WING FINALLY SUCCEEDS
IN PASSING UNDER THE WIRE FIRST
SadSamRunsAway
From a Trashy
Collection.

* : Vivid Flash.
6\* F. E. MULHOLIiAXD.
Two members of royalty. Dainty, the
queen of lhÂ« Western turf, and Misty's
Pride, the queen of the jungles, met in
a Futurity course sprint yesterday at
Oakland track.
At the conclusion Dainty wore the
honors, but the daughter of Golden
barter knew she had been present at a
horse race, and not a pink tea. Dainty
is not- partial to mud nor to sloppy go
ing, for which reason the handbooks
and poolrooms In town laid even money
shout the Jennings mare.
The city brokers were not aware that
Walter Jennings had engaged a thou
sand Indian hop-nickers to hold um
brellfts over a prescribed section of the
cour*e. and overlaid themselves. The
trafck was not muddy nor slushy from
the showersâ only the least bit slow
and inclined perhaps to be cuppy. At
the track the bookmakers held Dainty
a 7 to 10 chance. Charley Henshall's
Martinmas held second place in the
choice of bettors, with 23 to 5 quoted
against Misty's Pride. It is an abso
lute- certainty now that Dainty is at
her best on a bullet-fast track, for she
narrowly escaped defeat.
iilSTY'S PRIDE AS PACEMAKER.
-Jakie Jones rode Misty's Pride, and
he shot, the mare out In front like a
Ft reak of greased lightning, followed
by Martinmas. "Big Bill" Knapp kept
hard at work on the favorite, and about
a furlong from home ehe had the Ore
pon mare stretched out. Misty's Pride
d'd not die easily, though, for she was
only led out a neck, which distance
might have been increased had Dainty
not stumbled approaching the wire.
Three lengths back came Martinmas.
Rector and Albula were outclassed.
Favorites were in good form, annex
ins four purses. The threatening aspect
of the' weather had no noticeable effect
on the attendance.
After many trials and tribulations
Bronze Wing finally succeeded in fitting
himself to a pair of winning brackets.
Ltcyd Fountain rode the Racine geld
irjg'and at odds of 18 to 5 dropped him
6v\\n an easy first for the introductory
Fprtnt. Sam Greenfield on Emma Reu
bold finished second, beating Troy, the
lavorite. a length for the place.
Smooth, slippery going Sad Sam met
nothing of a distinguished order in the
six-furlong selling jaunt and 11 to 20
looked a liberal quotation. Sam Green
field piloted the Texas half-breed and
he won in ragtime fashion. Davis,
astride Sol Lichtensteln, beat Mimo for
place honors. The field was a small
one. Aibonita. El Piloto and J. H. Ben
r.ett being the only other starters.
OUTSIDER FINISHES FIRST. ,
Travers landed the mile selling affair
vmh Adirondack, a 13 to 1 outsider.
The field comprised a most ordi
nary cluster of platers, and -for lack of
something better Allopath, the Lamas
r.ey entry, was installed favorite. The
mare was done before six furlongs had
been covered. Travers got Adironadck
away in the lead and holding Barney
Dreyfuss safe at the end. passed the
v.ire first by two lengths. Batidor took
third place from the favorite.
Smithy Kane, a cold-blooded one
from the Texas panhandle country,
vent to the post equal choice with A.
Muskoday for the five and a naif fur
long two-year-old purse number.
Smithy, with Jakie Jones on his back,
fci a dazzlirg clip for four and a half
fyrlongs, then he began backing up.
Muskoday/ with Anderson up. was eas
ing up from Platt, the third choice. The
fhow went to Smithy Kane because
nothing else was close up.
Travers was seen to marked advan
tage again in the final race of the day.
He had the leg up on Garnet Fergu
son's Stilicho. the faverite. and nothing
ever headed him. Budd Wade put up
a breezy argument all the way, but his
peaiferrep rained him when it came to a
pinch and he lost by five lengths where
tile money is hung up. Sunny Shore
w^s third.

CHAN CHEUNG SEEKS TO
BE RELEASED OX BAIL
Snes Out Writ of Habeas Corpus,
Which Is Made Returnable Tihs
Morninsr.
Chan Cheung, who was indicted by
the Grand Jury Wednesday for the
murder of Tom Tick, yesterday sued
out a writ of habeas corpus that he
might present a petition for bail. On
the recommendation of the Grand
Jury the accused was committed with
out the privilege of bail, " and
his attorney contends that such
action was unwarranted. Presid
ing Judge Kerrigan issued the
writ and made it returnable before
Judge Lawlor at 11 o'clock to-day.
Chan Cheung is wealthy and his
counsel, Frank V. Bell, said yesterday
that any reasonable amount could be
furnished.
District Attorney Byington will be on
hand this morning to make vigorous
protest against releasing the prisoner.
Not alone is the evidence regarded as
strong that Chan Cheung was an ac
complice in the murder by offering a
reward for the life of Tom Yick, but
It Is also desired to keep him in con
finement in the^hope that he will tell
the Grand Jury all he knows of police
corruption in Chinatown. The prisoner
is supposed to have handled the $2000
fund collected every week from thÂ«
fantan and lottery games.
The police committee of the Grand
Jury did not meet yesterday. The
meeting of the full Grand Jury that
was to have been held this afternoon
was yesterday ordered postponed. In
asmuch as the committees have
brought nothing to a head as yet and
there would be no business to take up.

fession mnder the laws of the State as
ministers of religion. The association
"requests immunity for its members
from prosecution and annoyance in
any movement that may be inaugu
rated against the pretenders who in
fest our city." It is the intention of
Tax Collector Smith to collect a license
tax from mediums.
Boys Arrested for Burglary.

MAR1X COUNTY INVESTOR
SAYS HE WAS SWINDLED
James Begley Causes the Arrest of
Officers of an Alleged "Get-
Rlch-Quick" j Concern.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 29. â James W.
Butler, fc. Peiser and William Kohl
man, officers of the Royal Mercantile
Company of San Francisco, an al
leged "get-rich-quick" concern, ap
peared in -Justice of the Peace Ma
gee's court to-day to answer a charge
of obtaining money under false pre
tenses preferred ' by James Begley of
this city.
Begley alleges that the officers of
the company induced him by false
representations to invest $260 in four
of their diamond contracts. Begley
said he was first solicited to buy the
contracts, but refused unless the de
fendants could give him some assur
ance that he would realize on his in
vestment. A beautifully engraved
document with a gold seal attached
purporting to be a bond of the Equit
able Bonding and Trust Company of
San Francisco, guaranteeing to the
purchaser of every contract the faith
ful performance of its conditions, was
then produced for his satisfaction.
Begley has since discovered that the
bonding company is a myth.
- The defendants were placed under
$1000 bonds pending their trial, which
Is set for January 6, 1905.

LEWIS AFTER
JIMMY BRITT
Eastern Lightweight Boxer
Has Substantial Backing
for a Match With Him
McGOVERN HEARD FROM
The Ex-Champion Feather-
Weight Expresses Desire
to Meet the Californian
Special Dispatch t<* The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â All that Is
needed to consummate a match be
tween Jimmy Britt and Willie Lewis
for the lightweight championship is the
acceptance by the Californian of a
challenge wired him to-day by Lewis'
manager. Lewis agrees to fight Britt
at the lightweight limit. A check for
$2500 has been deposited to bind a
match. Johnnie Considlne, who has
posted the money for Lewis, will wager
it on the result of the fight.
It is expected an answer will be re
ceived from Britt to-morrow. A side
bet may be an inducement for Britt to
make a match. If he does he will face
the greatest little fighter in ihe East
to-day. Lewis has demonstrated j| his
worth by his decisive victory in nine
rounds over Martin Canole, a feat that
both Britt and Battling Nelson failed
to accomplish. Britt and Canole fought
a twenty-five round battle, while Nel
son received a good drubbing at the
hands of Canole for nineteen rounds.
Canole was completely outclassed by
Lewis, who was his superior both as a
boxer and a puncher.
WILKESBARRE, Pa.. Dec. 29.â
Terry McGovern, who came here to
day, declares he will not fight until the
end of his theatrical season and that
then he will get after Jimmy Britt and
will challenge him to fight. McGovern
said Britt's cleverness would Just suit
him. as he has not yet found a clever
boxer whom he cannot force to fight at
close range and points to his easy vic
tories over Erne and Gans. He praised
Young Corbett and said he hoped the
reports were true that his two-time
victor was going to take care of him
self and get into condition again.

"If the substitute wasn't any better

Commission during the. preliminary
hearing of the charge of insubordina
tion and disrespect to superiors pre
ferred by R. Allen, captain of Engine

attorney, -Archibald â  Barnard,' asked
the 'board that Parry be'not allowed to
sit in Judgment on his client's case,
alleging that the Commissioner .. was
prejudiced. Earry was vindicated by
a unanimous vote, of his colleagues,
although he offered to' retire if they
thought him prejudiced. .
-;The proceedings gave" ample oppor
tunity, for mirth. Matheson was
charged with disrespectfully ' asking
his captain to cease hammering and
go away and let him sleep: The cause
of the disturbance was the repairing
of a VsQueegee," an implement for
cleaning stalls, and Allen testified that
the nails he drove were a size larger
than -common pins. ... â¢. .
- After' evidence , was -' introduced by
Captain Allen, Driver Capelli and Bat

OBLITERATED
Health Officer Ragan Becom
mends Abatement of a
Nuisance on Army Street
TO CONDEMN FACTORIES
Low Grade ; of Milk Served
- in Restaurants, and Kitch
ens Are in Bad Condition
Health Officer D. F. Ragan at,yes
terday's meeting of the Health Board
submitted his monthly .report for De
cember in which he recommends .that
the Board" of Supervisors be requested
to pass an ordinance to extend the .lim
its for prohibited trades so as to ex
clude all such industries from the vi
cinity of the Army-street Bwamp, by
reason of imperfect drainage. and as a
matter of general nuisance and menace
to public health in a section that is
rapidly* growing; and that the board
revoke the permit granted for the es
tablishing of a laundry at Twenty-sixth
and York streets for the reason of the
improper facilities for the carrying off
of refuse water and drainage. Ragan
suggests that the board recommend to
the Supervisors the putting in of cul
verts c-r conduits to carry off the seep
age water, in the swamp as a temporary
means of . abating the nuisances. Ra
gan's report continues:
I recommend the condemnation of land be
tween Twenty-aixth and Army streets at those
points where Bryant, York and Hampshire
streets Intersect, so that the same may be
extended to Army street and sewer connections
carried through on those streets to the Army
street sewer. I recommend also that the
Board of Health condemn all those canneries
and soap factories now emptying their sewage
and drainage : into the swamps bordering on
Twenty-sixth and Army streets.
Cases of tuberculosis during December were
reported by attending physicians to a greater
extent than at any. other time during the.ex
istence of the ordinance relating to the noti
fication of such cases to the health office.
There has been an Increase in the number of
cases " of diphtheria and scarlet fever; with a
subsidence of cases of measles, varicella and
typhoid. Up to December 20 there have been
fceventy-slx deaths from pneumonia. This is
due to the weather and is to be expected this
season of the year.
The report tells of the arrest of twen
ty-four milk dealers who supplied res
taurants and bakeries with a very low
grade of milk and notes that the Po
lice Judges are co-operating in the
matter, of' obtaining a pure milk sup
ply by fining the offenders. Deplor
able sanitary., conditions are reported
in the kitchens of local restaurants, but
with the advent of the inspecting force
there began an immediate repair of the
premises to comply with the law's re
quirements. All the recommendations
in the report were approved by the

CONTRARY PROVISIONS OF
TWO WILLS ADJUDICATED
JiulRe Coffey ; Decides Questions Af
fecting Distribution of I->tato or
W'infleld si Jones.
The questions arising from the an
tagonistic provisions of the wills of
the late Winfleld S. Jones, admitted to
probate, were ..decided yesterday by
Judge Coffey.' Jones was connected
with the Security Savings and Loan
Society and left an estate appraised
at $95,658 06 and now worth more
than $100,000. Two wills were found,
one signed by witnesses, dated July
15, 1896, and the other holographic,
dated April 31, 1901. -
Both . testaments â¢ made a complete
disposition of the* property, but in the
first the residuum was bequeathed to
sisters- of the deceased and in the
second to charities. In other bequests
the wills were the same and the ques
tion -was raised as to whether suoh'
bequests should be considered sub
stantial or cumulative. It also de
veloped that the residue left to chari
ties in the second will amounted to
more than one-third of the estate, which
is .the limit that can be left to charity
under the California law. Then the
point at issue.,was whether 'the excess
over the one-third should go to the
sisters or the heirs at law.
Judge Coffey decided that the" be
quests in the holographic instrument
were substantial; thai the charities
should have -only one-third of the Cali
fornia estate and that the surplus of
the. rg3iduum .should be given to the
two sisters, Mary and Virginia B.
Jones. "This excess 'amounts to about
$20,000. r . The sisters also receive
$15,000 and. $20,000 respectively by di
rect bequest.

MAKES A QUEER REMARK
Intimates That His Connec

Cause o/ Present Injury
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â Standing al
most in the spot where Robert Bren
nan was shot to death by Patrolman
Arthur Mallon last May. William
O'Brien, a homeless waiter, who sava
the most important testimony in the
trial that resulted in Mallon being sent
to prison for twenty years, to-day re
ceived a bullet wound which probably'
will result in his death. O'Brien's as
sailant escaped and the waiter has re
fused to make any statement that
would assist the officers in, learning his
identity.
"When you go against thÂ» 'cops* you
get all that's coming to you," thÂ»
wounded man said as h* lay on the
floor of a saloon awaltinsr thÂ» arrival
of the ambulance. Three men ara un
der arrest as suspects.
O'Brien was walking down tha Bow
ery and had Just passed the saloon
where Brennan was killed when a shot
rang out and he fell with a bullet in
his abdomen. The police advance the
theory that O'Brien had been In a fight
and that he was shot after he had
stabbed his adversary.
O'Brien, who is 25 years old, has an'
interesting police record.

BIG SHIPS
AT MERCY
OF WAVES
Oil Steamship Goes Ashore
Off Cape Hatteras and for
Thirty-Six Hours ller Crew
Is Exposed to Gale's Fury
HESCUED BY HEROIC
GUARDIANS OF COAST
Drumelzier Abandoned as a
Total Wreck by Captain and
Few Men Who Stuck to Ves^
sel in Hope of Saving Her
NORFOLK, Va., Dec 29.â After be
ing imprisoned on the wrecked . oil
steamship Northeastern nine miles off
Cape Hatteras for thirty-six hours,
Captain Wilder and his crew of twen
ty-one men were . taken ashore at noon
to-day by the crews of Klnnakeet,
Creeds Hill and Hatteras life-saving
stations. The big steamship is pound
ing on Diamond Shoals under a terrific
sea, and the crew say she will be a
total loss.
In a bewildering fog Tuesday night
the Northeastern, on her way up the
coast from Port Arthur, Tex., to New
York with a cargo of crude petroleum,
shoved her prow Into the deadly sand
off Hatteras and was fast , in the
clutches of the graveyard of shipping
before her crew realized what had hap
pened.
This was at 11 o'clock, and before
daylight had come the gale that had
swept over the country from the Mid
dle West had struck the sea and waves
were crashing over the helpless vessel
Incessantly. The lorce of the wind and
tide threw her on her port beam and
the flood of water extinguished her
fires before her inflammable cargo
could become ignited. Had this not
been the case the twenty-two men
aboard the Northeastern would have
met a horrible fate.
When morning dawned the wreck
was sighted by life-savers and the
weather observers at Hatteras. She was
nine miles off shore and the water be
tween was a seething mass of moun
tainous waves. The crews of the Creeds
Hill and Klnnakeet life-saving stations
were summoned, and this morning the
life-savers began their attempts to get
a boat through the heavy seas.
BATTLE WITH BREAKERS.
After a three hours' struggle at 9
o'clock three lifeboats were safely
across the' breakers and battling with
the outside seas on their way to the
steamer.
When the stirfmen reached the wreck
they were confronted with a problem of
great danger and difficulty. The sea,
although It had subsided to some ex
tent, was still in an angry mood, and
the little lifeboats were being | tossed
like cockle shells about the helpless
mass of steel. Lines were finally strung
between the boats and the. Northeast
ern and after much trouble every man
was taken from the vessel in safety.
More than six hours were consumed
before the first of the boats reached
shore again.
The Northeastern is an ocean-going
steamship built/ of steel in Chicago in
1901, and is owned by C. Counselman of
Cincinnati.
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â With her sig
nals of distress and her half-masted
ensign still flying, the steamship Drum
elzier was abandoned to-night as a to
tal wreck by her captain and a dozen of
the ship's crew were taken off the craft
and landed on Oak Island by the crew
of the Fire Island and Oak Island life
saving stations. Early in the day eight
een men of the crew were taken off
the stranded steamship by the surfboat
of the Sandy Hook station which was
towed down to the scene. .
The men were brought to this city
later on a tug.
LAST TO LEAVE SHIP.
Captain Nicholson, Chief Engineer
Wood and a number of officers and
crew decided to remain on board until
officially notified that the vessel had
been placed in the hands of the wreck
ing company, in order to obviate any
claim for salvage* on the derelict. .
At 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon the
captain decjded that it was unwise to
remain longer on the ship which was
being terribly buffeted by the heavy
seas and asked immediate rescue from
the crews of the nearby stations, who
at once responded to ,his r signals and
after a hard struggle the men were
taken off and landed at Oak Island. '
The rescue of the men on the Drum
elzier was hazardous in the extreme
and was attended by many thrilling in
cidents. ' -
HAVRE, Dec. 29.â The British steam

and five members of the crew of the

board, reports having rescued them In
midocean when the Chester was sink
ing after having encountered a four
days' storm. Captain Nelson set fire
to the schooner before abandoning her.
The American Consul here will send
the rescued persons home.
SHIP'S NARROW ESCAPE.
Disabled Steanic r Puritan Towed to

NEW LONDON, Conn., Dec. 29.â
The steamer Puritan of the Fall River
line was disabled early to-day while
off Pleasant View, R. I., by the break
ing: of her paddle wheel. The steamer
was cbmpelled to stop and, drifting
inshore, came to anchoix Three steam
ers answered the signals ' of distress
and stood by/until daylight. Later
the Puritan was towed to this port
After^an examination Captain Chase
decided to make repairs and continue
the trip to New York. There were
400 passengers on the disabled' vessel,
of which 100 landed here, the remain

There was no excitement aboard the
vessel at the time of the accident.

IN NEXT! SUNDAY'S
COMIC â  SECTION.
TWO ASPIRANTS
WELL IN FRONT
Bard and Flint Display Ac
tivity in the Contest
for Seat in the Senate
EUEF AND JOHN DALY
Fail life of the South to Unite
May Lead to Candidacy
of Judge John F. Davis
The ranks of visiting statesmen in
San Francisco were materially rein
forced yesterday by the arrival of State
Senators and Assemblymen. Many, of
the legislators visited Bard headquar
ters In the Mutual Savings Bank build
ing and Flint headquarters, room 262,
Palace Hotel. It is the talk of poli
ticians that Bard and Flint will be the
leaders on the early balloting for the
Senatorshlp. Bard's leading support
ers have advised the Senator that he
ought to come to Sacramento. It is
said that Flint will have a legion of
boomers at the State capital next week.
As Congress meets again on January 4,
Senator- Bard may be constrained by
a sense of public duty to deny himself
the pleasure of visiting. Sacramento
while the Legislature is in session.
Inside comment on the Senatorial sit
uation is to the effect that the "or
ganization" has resolved to keep hands
off the contest. It is known that
strong, but unavailing, pressure has
been exerted to induce the Southern
Pacific railroad people to declare op
position to the re-election of Senator
Bard.
â¢ Many members of the Legislature
will arrive in San Francisco to-day
and a number, if not a majority, will
leave here for Sacramento to-morrow
evening. Bard headquarters at the
Capitol Hotel and Flint headquarters
at the Golden Eagle will be opened to
morrow night
Governor Pardee returned to the
State capital yesterday. The assertion
is made by his friends that he is taking
no part whatever in the Senatorial
contest. General George Stone, chair
man of the Republican State Central
Committee, is also said to be dwelling
in the neutral zone.
The prediction is made by United
Republican Leaguers that A. Ruef will
receive eighteen votes for United States
Senator. It is claimed that he will be
supported on several ballots by Sena
tors Nelson, Markey, Bunkers, Wolfe,
Bauer, French and Keene and by As
semblymen Atkinson, Anthony, Beck
ett, Cullen, Lucey. McGowan, McNam
ara, Meincke, Mindham, Strohl and
Vogel.
Rumor goes that Senator Welch and
Assemblyman Treadwell will vote for
John D. Daly. Postmaster Arthur Fisk
will be supported by Senator Short
ridge and Assemblyman Jones.
Among the statesmen in the city are:
Senators Howard A. Broughton, Los
Angeles; John B. Irish, Sierra; C. B.
Greenwell, Santa Barbara; Assembly
men John A. Bliss, Alameda; F. A.
Cromwell, Sonoma; Ernest Weyand,
Colusa; Dr. W. F. Gates, Orovllle; E.
T. Manwell, Wheatland; W. D. L. Held,
Ukiah; B. M. Pyle, Santa Barbara, and
William H. Wickersham, San Pedro.
It Is generally conceded by the Re
publicans that some Senatorial candi
date residing In Southern California
should be chosen Senator, but failure
on the part of the southern representa
tives to agree may cause the introduc
tion of John F. Davis of Amador as a
candidate. . It is remarked that Davis'
superior attainments as a public man
would surely enlist the admiration of
the Legislature. Speaking of his pro
posed candidacy this comment was
made yesterday in the Palace court:
"Judge Davis is recognized everywhere
in California as a high class man. The
quality of his oratory and the char
acter of his utterances were an in
spiration to President Roosevelt when
the latter visited the Union League
Club in this city. Judge Davis, by rea
son of his' scholarly attainments and
his ability to impress his views upon
others, would command marked atten
tion in the United States Senate."
MONARCH, THE GRIZZLY,
IS ONCE AGAIN A PARENT
Last Accounts Say Mother' and Cub
Are Doing Well and Father
Is Delighted.
Born, to the wife of Monarch, the
park' grizzly, a cub. Mother and child
are doing well and the father is, biting
off chunks of the cage In his glee. The
little stranger evidently pleases both
parents, for Mr. and Mrs.' Monarch
were holding a small admiration so
ciety near him last night.
They held a late session, discussing
plans for the youngster's future. Out
siders were not wanted, as park at
taches discovered when they tried to
enter the cage with little comforts for
yesterday's arrival. Pa Monarch evi
dently objects to his offspring being fed
on condensed milk or anypatent prep
arations.
A cub born In the cage last year died
a few days after its birth. That one,
however, was a sickly looking speci
men, while the more recent arrival is a
husky miniature of Its pa. Perhaps that
is why the parent is so pleased over the
event.

OAKLAND, Dec. 29.â John Spykie, a
rancher living on Lincoln avenue

â  After the fire had partly burned itself j
out the body of Spykie was found in

HALES JUDGE
BEFORE COURT
Supreme Judges of Colorado
Take an Unusual Step in
the Election Fraud Cases
WRITS ARE DISMISSED
Plan to Unseat Governor-
Elect^Adams Will Be Op
posed by Some
DENVER, Dec 29. â For the first
time in the history of the State a
Judge of a District Court was com
pelled to-day to appear in person be
fore the Supreme Court of the State
and explain to that tribunal why he
had issued a writ of mandamus when
it was apparent that he was in error
in so doing. Judge Samuel L. Car
penter of the District Court was the
member of the bench served with tha
citation.
A solemn protest against the action
of the high court was entered by Judge
Carpenter, and he said that under tha
circumstances he believed that he had
authority to issue the writ of man
damus against the State Canvassing
Board to force that body to canvass
the returns made for Charles B. Warde
and Dr. Michael Beshoar. candidates
for the Senate on the Democratic ticket
from Boulder and Las Animas coun
ties, respectively. Being now advised
that the Supreme Court has decided
that District courts have no power to
issue such writs, the Judge says, "It
becomes obligatory upon this respond
ent, without order of this court, of his
own motion, to dismiss such proceed
ings."
Judge Carpenter was thereupon dis
charged by the Supreme Court, the
writs Issued by him were dismissed
and he was directed not to take any
further action, directly or indirectly,
in the matter.
Very few members of the Legisla
ture have arrived in the city, and
whether the plans of William G. Ev
ans and other Republican leaders to
reseat Governor James H. Peabody
will be adopted by a majority of tha
Republican members is still undecided.
Some Republican members known as
followers of former United States Sen
ator Edward O. Wolcott have declared
that while they do not contemplate a
union with the Democrats under any
consideration, they will oppose vigor
ously any plan for counting out
Adams.
Fourteen Indictments against Julius
Aichele, former County Clerk, were dis
missed by Judge William P. Seeds In
the District Court to-day on the ground
that two terms of court had passed and
the cases had not been called for trial.
Chief Justice Gabbert announced this
afternoon that the Supreme Court had
not found time to consider the petition
of Governor-elect Alva Adams to orjen
all the ballot boxes used in Denver at
the election and determine the extent
of the frauds. He added that a decision
might be given to-morrow.
By the action of the State Canvas
sing Board in issuing certificates of
election as Senators to Casimiro Ba
rela and Henry B. Millard. the Repub
licans have secured such absolute con
trol of the General Assembly that It is
now regarded in Democratic circles aa
highly probable that Governor James
H. Peabody will be reseated. The.Re
publicans plan to accomplish this by
throwing out the vote of all Demo
cratic wards of Denver and countinc
the votes of the Republican wards.
The Liberty League State Convention
adopted the following resolution to
day:
Resolved. That we denounce in unmeasured
terms the action of the Republican party . In
attempting: to override the plainly expressed
will of the people by arbitrarily throwing out
the returns from a large number of precincts,
to the end that the State Senate ir.ay be toade
eubaervlent to corporate jtreed. that the Su
preme Court may bt> packed and that James
H. Peabody. overwhelmingly repudiated at the
polls, may be . forced upon the people of this
State for another biennial period.
â  Another resolution declares that the elec
tion laws of Colorado are a farce and de
mands their revision.
Indians on Half Rations.
HELENA. Mont., Dec. 29. â Regis
trar Gordon of the United States Land
Office, Miles City, says that the re
ports of starvation among the North
ern Cheyenne Indians at Lame Deer
Agency are exaggerated. The Indians
have been on half rations a number of
years and every winter the whites
complain, as they do now, that the In
dians kill their stock.

CHICAGO BOAKD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. 29.â The unexpected de
crease of the world's visible stocks strength- j
ened the wheat market to-day. Light receipts !
furnished support. At the close May was up J
%c. Government report giving final figures
on the crop of 1904 was considerable of a dis
appointment to bull traders. . and in conae- j
quer.ee when trading began the pit was flooded I
with selling orders. Predictions had been i
freely made Uiat the official figures would not !
show over 500,000,000 bushels as the total
yic-ld of wheat grown, in the United States
Â«urlcÂ» 1304. It was a distinct surprise to
many operators that the Government experts .
estimated the totul aj 552,000,OUO bushels.
The reception given the report was manifested '
by sharp initial declines. May was off ?ic to j
l?io at $1 11144 to $1 13Â«i. Before any sup- ,
:Port came to the market tha prica had touched i
$1 12%. The market soon recovered a por- â¢
tlon of the early loss, however, on moderate
â¢coverirss by shorts. ' There was also some'
buyinr on an -Argentine cable claiming that
nc# crop arrivals were- of poor quality, in
addition the cash situation showed signs of
improvement TherÂ» was a sharp advance '
late In the day' as a result of the excellent I
demand. Odb of thÂ© bull leaders was a con
spicuous buyer. May sold up to $1 14%. The ;
ir.arket held firm the last part of the session, !
the close being almost at thÂ« highest point '.
with final figures on Hay at ?1 14%.'
Weakness of -wheat had some effect on the i
corn market vearly la the: day. May opened:
unchanged to %c lower s.t 45Ji@45%c and !
closed at 45%c. ,
Trading in oats \ru of a scalping character
and prices showed only slight fluctuations.
May closed at 31 %c. . . â¢ . â¢
. . At the opening sentiment In thÂ« provision
market was quite firm as a result of 'decreased
receiots of hoss. At the close May pork 'was
off .'w87M;c; lard was down *7Â»Â£c, and ribs 2V4o
â¢lower. â¢ . â¢ .-...â¢- .

Wheat and Other Grains. -
- WHEAT â The foreign markets were not ma
terially changed. Chicago declined under the
! Government report, 'which Indicated a total
] crop of 5u2,3uSi,517 bushels, but subsequently
1 rtcoveicd and closed %c higher on the day.
I Brokers' wires from Chicago said:
; "Messages from people close to the bis In
terests talci t^at the Government crop report
was a severe disappointment. They had been j
' counting on it to show a total crop of less
[than 510,000,000 bushels, and had In fact |
i Hooded Western' markets with estimates that 1
! lt would, show less than 500,000,000 bushels.
If the crop Is as large as the Government
I report indicates, and there are a few In the
j Western trade that question It. the position
of the large Eastern owners of Wheat Is- by
no means as comfortable as it was understood
to be."
This market was ' quiet and unchanged all
around.

firm, particularly for fancy Burbanks, there
being no fresh arrivals from the Salinas Val

were well maintained. Receipts from the river
districts were light and Included very little
fancy stock, and .Inferior offerings moved off
better In consequence. Sweets were unchanged
and Onions still had a declining tendency, al
though â  prices were not quotably lower.
Southern vegetables were In free . supply and
thQ general rua of offerings, which showed the
I effects of tho recent rain In the growing dis
tricts, were dull at easy rates, while the best
offerings of f reeh stock i were In good request
at the top quotations. Dried Peppers are of

Though the markets everywhere are dull, as
usual at the close of the year, they seem to
be in pretty good shape, .judging from the
following mail report from New York:
"Generally speaking, tha , market Is firm, as
stocks, of most varieties in the hands of job
bers are very much smaller than usual at this
season, and there is a good prospect for busl- j
ness af(,er the turn of the year. This is par
ticularly true of spot Prunes, which, though
selling only in a hand-to-mouth way, are held
firmly up to the quotations.' No interest in
future shipments is manifested at present, but
holders on the coast do not seem to be par
ticularly anxious to sell and we hear of no
offerings below a l 1 jc f. o. b. four-size bag
basis for the intermediate sizes, with a pre
mium of at least a quarter of a cent on 40a
and 90s. Oregon Italians are reported to bo
closely cleaned up on the coast and supplies
here are not urged. * Little demand for Rais
ins of any kind exists at present. For Call
fornia seeded stock on the spot market is dull
and unsettled, though wo hear' of no offerings ]
of fancy old crop below 5^0.' Offerings from i
the coast attract no attention, even when a :
concession of half a cent from the combine's
quotation of 6c f. o. b. for fancy Is made by
outside . coast seeders. Malaga Raising are
easy under pressure to clean lip holding's. Cur
rants remain very firm; but we hear of no
business of . consequence. Figs are still dull
and weak." <

DENIES DECREE
TO DR. ESTES
Judge Kerrigan Decides in
' JFavor of Chorus Girl Who
Fought Suit for Divorce
HER DEFENSE SUCCEEDS
Counter - Charges Sufficient
to Block Husband's Case.
Wives Want Separations
Dr. Weston B. Estes, physician on a
steamship plying between this port and
Panama, has not found it easy to rid
himself of his chorus girl wife, who
was Myrtle Scott when she played at
Fischer's Theater and who is now with
the Kolb-Dlll troupe In Australia-
Judge Kerrigan had the case under
submission for several weeks and yes
terday decided to deny the doctor's
prayer for an Interlocutory decree.
Estes charged his wife with cruelty,
the main allegation being based upon
her attempt to have him confined in
Mrs. Atkinson's sanitarium on Sutter
street for the cure of the morphine
habit. She had him handcuffed and
taken there forcibly, but he was re
leased the next day. Mrs. Estes denied
his charges, and In a recriminatory de
fense accused him of neglect and brutal
treatment. She said that he was ad
dicted to the use of drugs" and com
pelled her to go on the stage, sew and
pick fruit for a living. The young doc
tor was said to have borrowed money
from his wife's aunt w Mrs. E. Dexter
Baker, with which to buy furniture for
his office. In the trial of the case it
was shown that Dr. Estes' mother was
very anxious for him to obtain a di
vorce.
Mona Lily Bleakmore yesterday sued
Lea Bleakmore for divorce on the
ground of cruelty. They were married
in Arizona in 1899. She says that on an
occasion when she fainted at the Re
gina Hotel in this city he kicked her,
and when she was ill at the French
Hospital he taunted her with her con
dition and expressed the hope that she
would die.
May Houston, who had her husband,
Matthew Houston, arrested on Decem
ber 19 for beating her, yesterday sued
him for divorce on the ground of cru
elty. Other actions for legal separa
tions were begun by Estella Erb
against Oliver Erb for desertion, and
Harris Gluck against Leah Gluck.
whom hie married In Poland in 1886 and
who deserted him ten years ago.
A $35,000 PURE GOLD
DOG IN TOWN TO-DAY
The 24-carat pure gold Victor Talking '
Machine dog which created so much talk
at the St. Louis Fair arrived* in San
Francisco yesterday. It will be exhibit
ed in the windows of Sherman, Clay &
Co. from 8:30 a. m. until 5:30 p. m. dall>
for one week. This is one of the great
est reproductions Tiffany & Co. of New
York have ever made. The dog stands
about 18 inches high, is composed of
nothing but pure 24-karat gold, while the
metal parts of the talking machine and
horn are of the same material. As the
insurance company requires that both
dog and machine be deposited in the
vaults of the Crocker-woolworth Bank
while the store is closed, it can only be,
seen during the day time.
MAIL CARRIER SUES.â F. H. Stanley, a
postofflce employe, yesterday sued the United
Railroads for (20.000 damages for personal In
juries received on August 21. According to
his complaint he was driving a mall wag-on
along Nineteenth etreet, collecting mall. As
he was crossing Mission street a car struck
the rig and threw it forty feet The wagon
was smashed and Stanley was badly bruised,
he says, and was laid up for repairs for three
weeks.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL", FRIDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1904.
MAN IN UNIFORM
DRAWS CONTEMPT
OF ERIN'S SONS
They Dislike All "Peelers'
Jmdge Mogaira, However, Declares
They' â Should. Dascrimtaate.
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
In a dialect that mingled the South
of Scotland's burr with the West of
Ireland's drone, Donald McAuliffe and
John G. Williams were warmly de
bating at Third and Bryant streets
early yesterday morning when Patrol
man Bruce gently suggested that they
hire a hall.
"For," he added, "your language Is
neither ornamental nor useful to the
casual passer-by."
He was rudely turned upon by Don
ald McAullfte, who addressed him as
a "domd peeler," and insinuated that if
he desired to avoid most serious trou
ble to himself he would move on. Mr.
Williams also said something and his
manner rather than his -words, . which
were unintelligible, convinced the po
liceman that it was intended to con
vey defiance, if not menace. So in
stead of moving on he arrested both
Mr. McAuliffe and Mr. Williams for
disturbing the peace, and all the way
to the prison they talked about him.
He did not understand all they said,
but was satisfied that none of their
allusions were complimentary. They
seemed to be affected with acute po
licephobla, for Mr. McAuliffe de
clared'that he had no more use for
"peelers" In America than he had for
them when he was In Ireland, from
the northern province of which island
both he and his companion recently
arrived.
Neither of the defendants could or
would explain his deep seated dislike
of the police, but Judge .Mogan did
not seem to be in need of enlighten
ment on that point.
"In the country you came from," he
said, "the constabulary is detested be
cause it represents the mailed hand
of oppression, but as the police of this
country are representative-, of good
citizenship they should be immune
from your inherent hatred. When you
have dwelt here another year you
may be ready to confess that the po
lice force of San Francisco, collect
ively and Individually, Is entitled to
the respect Instead of the detestation
of folk who are not criminals. I'll
tell you more about it to-morrow."
Salvator Giovanni, who operates a
fruit business on First avenue, de
manded that a jury, be impaneled to
hear the testimony of the plain clothes
policemen who Inveigled, him into sell
ing a flask of whisky for 25 cents.
Judge Mogan has the demand under
consideration. ' - ' â  .
Orval Swartout, with hair j parted
in the middle and paletot worn neg
lige, â¢ averred that his carrying of a
concealed â  pistol was a precautionary
measure in the line of self-protection.
He came here from St. Helena, he ex
plained, to endeavor "to obtain -for
Mrs. E. B. Richardson, wife of an ag
riculturist in that town, a Job that
would be more in keeping with. her
desire and abilities â¢ than .was â¢ the
drudgery of keeping house for a hus
bandman, and as the lady was also
in the city, he feared that her spouse
might come in pursuit and incidental
ly take a shot at him to rebuke his
encouragement of her ambition to're
sume single harness. As the time of
Mr. Swartout's arrest was 3 a. m. and
the place Page and Stanyan streets,
Judge Mogan ordered further investi
gation.
Henry Dillon ' and James Bbarboro,
tent dwellers on "the dumps," as the
place for depositing the city's garbage
is termed, were suspected of having
robbed a butcher shop of several Juicy
steaks and succulent chops. The po
liceman who invaded their canvas
dwelling experienced some difficulty in
effecting their capture, as the interior
was inky dark and they were trucu
lent. Judge Fritz has continued the
hearing until the "officer, has concluded
his quest of the pilfered meat.
Harry Roberts was peddling fruit
at Sixth and Stevenson streets when
a housewife purchased some of his
wares and handed him a $5 gold piece
from which to subtract the price.
Harry affirmed he did not have suffi
cient small change, but would go and
swap the golden coin for silver. He
went, and after waiting until she be
came suspicious the lady told her
trouble to a policeman, who: traced
Harry to the ferry station and there
arrested him as he was buying trans
portation to Emeryville.' He will be
sentenced by Judge Mogan. â¢
When the case of Quong Tuck, ac
cused of peddling cigars, was called in
Judge Fritz's court there was no re
sponse from the arresting policeman,
registered as C. J. Green. /Then it was
claimed by the defense that the cap
turer of Quong was not a policeman at
all, but an audacious operator, of con
fidence games, who to
blackmail the . Chinese ' by ' threatening
to deliver him at the CityJ Prison if he
declined to obtain release at . the ! cost
of all the money in his . possession.
The game was spoiled by Quong*s faili
, ure to submit to the bluff, â¦ averred . the
! defense, ' and , then i to "save i his : face"
. the counterfeit policeman fulfilled his
! threat and represented -himself at; the
j prison as a special Chinatown > officer.
I Quong has been ! restored .to â¢ freedom
and some policemen of unquestioned
genuineness are in search of Mr.
Green.
Ben McGIynn's young lady friend
was visiting the home of Mr. and Mrs.
A. H. Kohler, 672 Hayes street, the
evening of % November 1, 1904. when
Be n went there and made himself so
disagreeable to all the inmates, the
young lady included, that his expul
sion was effected and his arrest re
quested, but he eluded capture until
last Saturday night, when Patrolman
Kearny identified him as a peace dis
turber at Hayes and Laguna streets.
Judge Mogan pronounced him. guilty
Oi. both charges and is reserving sen
tence.
Daniel Carroll, who was found In
the company of several confirmed

clared that his arrest for vagrancy
was one of the greatest blunders ever
committed by Patrolmen Davids and
McGrayen, whose special function it
is to ascertain the true social status
of "wine joint" habitues.
"I'm a stableman from B'lingum,"
Mr. Carroll averred, "and If It comes
to a showdown of character I'll match
mine against that of any man in San
Francisco." \ .
"You move- In the first circle of Bur-
Hngame â B'lingum â society. I pre
sume?" remarked Judge Mogan.
"Any of the first families down there
can tell you who I am. Just subpena
them and you'll find more style in
your court 'in one day than has ever
been in It."
Clerk "Pat" Grey did not have 400
blank subpenas on hand, so his Honor
took Mr. Carroll's word for it and or
dered his dismissal.
Nellie St. Clair, a comely octoroon,
will be tried In the Superior Court on
the charge of grand larceny. She was
sent there by Judge Fritz, who fixed
her bail In the sum of $2000.
It was MIbs St. Claires love of fine rai
ment that . made her a candidate for
the- penitentiary. From the City of
Paris dry goods emporium she obtained
one black etamine dress, valued at $80,
by falsely representing 1 that she had
been sent for the garment by Mrs. W.
J.. Hyde of 115 Athol avenue, Oakland,
and the goods were found in her pos
session.
"Ah, heaven, Judge, darling!" ex*
claimed Senorlta Frances Lopez, squat
of figure and tawny of complexion,
â¢when his Honor Judge Cabaniss had
sentenced her to three months' lmpris-
onment for vagrancy. "Dree mont de
varra long time! Please, darling!"
"Your endearment might be more ef
ficacious if you had not just completed
a six months' term," was the Judge's
response. "However, I'll make it two
months."
"Two monts! Ah, heaven, Judge, dar
ling, eet vill keel me! Please, darâ "
"Stop that I. I'll cut it to one month,
and â " Â»
"One mont! Oh, heaven, Judge, dar
ling, one â "
"It's reduced to fifteen daysâ take her
away!" shouted the Judge, mopping:
his brow.
"Feef teen days! Ah, heaven, Judge â "
"Take her away!" yelled the bench,
and the bailiff promptly obeyed.
"You j will doubtless go to the peni
tentiary," said Judge Mogan to Charles
Henry, committed to answer in the Su
perior Court a charge of assault with
intent to rob and a charge of robbery,
"but you ought to be sent to the gal
lows. The, coming Legislature should
be petitioned to make capital punish
ment the penalty of an offense such as
you have been- here convicted of."
Henry waylaid and brutally beat Jo
seph Frankenberg. a Front street mer
chant, the night of December 23 at Sac
ramento and Maple streets, and the de
scription of the thug published at that
time led to his Identification by "Walter
Glonz, whom he had held up and robbed
of $10 the night of December 12 at Page
and Stelner streets. The beating of Mr.
Frankenberg, who is an old man, was
not provoked by resistance on his part.
Ere a word was spoken the footpad
struck his victim's head several heavy
blows .with a revolver,, and was in the
act of robbing him when three young
men went to the rescue and effected
the cowardly fellow's capture.

FIRE THREATENS
ENTIRE BLOCK
Flames Gut Frame Building
at Southwest Corner of
East and Market Streets
3IANY TENANTS SUFFEK
Blaze Starts in Water Front
Kestaurant and Spreads
With Startling Rapidity
Over-boiling grease in the kitchen of
a water front restaurant yesterday
started a blaze which in a few minutes
enveloped in flames the three-story
frame building at the southwest corner
of East and Market streets. The Fire
Department responded promptly to the
two alarms turned in and had the
blaze under control in remarkably short
time. . While the fire blazed, however,
it burned fiercely and when the "all
out" signal was turned In the building
had been extensively gutted and a
score or more of tenants were seeking
new quarters.
The fire started in the kitchen of the
Magnolia restaurant. 6 Cast street, at
2:40 p. m. The Magnolia's immediate
neighbors are saloons and each made
early and liberal contributions of liquid
fuel for the flames. Almost with the
suddenness of an explosion thÂ© fire
raced through the restaurant and
leaped out into" the street, carrying the
front of the eating-house with it. One
tongue of flame climbed up the front of
the building, spreading as it mounted,
setting fire to the inflammable wall and
carrying the conflagration through
open windows into the upper stories.
Other tongues burned through the
partitions separating the Magnolia
from large supplies of alcoholic
liquors, which took up the work of
spreading the fire. Within a few min
utes' after the cook spilled the grease
there was a belt of fire along the East
street limits of the building and an
other making its way up Market
street. The entire front of the build-
Ing, to the roof, was blazing fiercely
and, fanned by a high wind, the flames
threatened to wipe out the entire block.
Captain of Police Martin was prompt
ly on the scene with a squad of harbor
police and had everything clear for the
firemen when they came racing to the
rescue. The water was turned on, the
flames died down as quickly as they
had appeared, and within a few min
utes fire laddies were climbing all over
the structure finishing the work of ex
tinction. â¢ Â« â¢
The building was well tenanted, but
in spite of the rapidity with which the
flames spread, all got out in safety. On
the Market-street side the only means
of exit is by elevator. At the height of
the excitement the elevator, packed as
it had never been before, stuck be
tween two floors and for a few minutes
pandemonium reigned in the iron cage.
Then something gave way and the cage
dropped gently to the street, where the
scared passengers disembarked. Dr. E.
A. Dig-gins, the well-known physician,
who has offices on the second floor, was
too late for the elewator and made his
way to the street, hand over hand,
down a friendly rope. Truckman Frank
Casassa of Truck 2 slipped and fell
from one of the scaling ladders, but
was not seriously injured.
The building Is owned by the West
Coast Realty Company and most of the
loss is said to be covered by Insurance.
The following: tenants suffered ' loss
through the fire:
Stromer & Bodln, barbers, 6 East street;
Harden & Iversen, saloon, 10 East street;

CREDITORS HAVE
THEIR REVENGE
0. A. Reed Tried, Convicted
and Sentenced on Charge
of Concealing His Goods
O. A. Reed was convicted by Police
Judge Cabaniss yesterday afternoon on
a charge of concealing goods with in
tent to defraud his creditors.. He was
sentenced to serve ten months in the
County Jail. Notice of appeal was giv
en and the ball was fixed In $5000 bonds
or $2500 cash. Attorney Bert Schles
lnger prosecuted the case on behalf
the creditors.
Heed came here from Minnesota
about a year ago. He opened an office
in the Crocker building and from Jan
uary 1, 1904, to December 1 he pur
chased about $15,000 worth of diamonds
from wholesale jewelers here and in the
East. On these purchases he paid
small . amounts.
The creditors became suspicious, and
on November 1 demanded an inspection
of his stock. He took them to the Safe
Deposit building and showed them
about $8000 worth of diamonds in his
box there. They were not satisfied, and
on November 15 they attached the
goods In his office and found about $300
worth of cheap jewelry.
â¢ A meeting of the creditors was called
and Reed stated that he had sold goods
at the race track between November
6 and 14 to the value of between $6000
and $7000, but he could not give the
names of the purchasers or the
amounts received. He also stated that
he had sold about $2500 worth to a ped
dler whose name he could not give.
His books were examined, but they
contained no record of sales, and his
bank book showed no deposits. His
safe deposit box was found In his of
fice empty. It was ascertained that the
race track was not open on the days
Reed alleged he sold the $6000 or $7000
worth of goods.
Judge Cibanlss, in sentencing Reed,
said it was one of the most n&grant
cases of the kind that had ever come to
his knowledge. He also commented se
verely on the attitude of the defendant
during the trial of the case, which was
defiant in the extreme.
