CHICAGO. April 20. â Heavy storms
prevailed in several States in the Mid
tflle West to-day. Reports tell of much
damage to fruit and early spring prod
ucts. Railroad and streetcar traffic
was impeded and telegraph and tele
phone communication interrupted.
At St. Louis blizzard conditions pre
vailed and six inches of snow was
measured. The horse racing and the
baseball game scheduled for this after
noon were called off. At the World's
Fair grounds it was said that the only
trouble occasioned by the storm would
.be in delaying the work of preparing
for the opening on April 30.-^ The dif
ficulties, however, may be overcome by
increasing the force of workmen.
It is reported from Kansas City that
a light snow was accompanied by a de
cided fall in temperature in North
western Missouri. Throughout Kansas
there was a heavy rain, an inch of

"'According to dispatches from Gen
eral Mistchenko, Japanese ships wera
also' seen "near Souchou.' "
ST. PETERSBURG, April 20.â What
may turn out to be the expected flank
ing" movement of the Japanese troops
is the appearance of a number. of Jap
enses ships. off Potansa, near the Gulf
of Chingtaitse, as reported to the^Em
peror to-day by General Kuropatkin.
Military experts here have long regard
ed that vicinity as the probable point
of disembarkation of the second Jap
anese expedition. It is not far away
from Takushan (twelve miles to the
east) and connects by road with Port
Arthur . (150 miles j to the southwest)
and Fengwangcheng (fifty miles, to the
northwest) where the Russians , will
make their first obstinate resistance.
Though the Japanese are building ln
trenchments on the .Yalu, it is believed
that they will advance soon. .The ar
rangements "for a turning movement
are complete and experts say that such
a move, could properly begin at Taku
shan.' as ' Fengwangcheng lies at the
angle of an equilateral triangle, with
Takushan 'and the mouth of the Yalu
<as. angles at;the base of;the triangle. .
The Japanese embarkation undoubt
edly will be, covered by warships/; and
this, Russia nsVre^osnize *ihat/lt\will' be
impossible .to prevent it. * -7~--/.r-
V We" will strike after they have land
ed," grimly, said a member of the gen
eral staff. â¢
General Kuropatkin is aware 'of the
strategic importance of the vicinity of
Takushan. and it is understood that he
has made arrangements accordingly.
General â Kuropatkln's report to the
Emperor is as follows:
"General Kashtalinsky reports as fol
lows on April 19:
*' 'All is" quiet on the, Yalu. .The Jap
anese are throwing up intrenchments'
opposite Golutsky. and. farther to the
north. The numbers of .'Japanese
troops are increasing. They are con
centrating at " Wiju and .,* spreading
toward the north along the Yalu. \
"".'Cossack sentinels have observed
the lights of Japanese transports near

. SEATTLE. Wash.. April â¢ 20. â
Thomas Thornton went to Alaska a
poor man, leaving a loving wife and
two small children In-Seattle. To-day
he appeared in a Justice Court to
answer a charge of burglary, preferred
by his wife, who had obtained a di
vorce during his absence' and married
Joseph Allenby. Mrs. Thornton (or
Allenby) failed to* appear and the
case was dismissed.
Thornton did not communicate with
his wife regularly after he went to
the gold fields, and she, after trying to
get trace of him, concluded he was
dead and got a divorce. Later she
married. Allenby. . .. ;Â£rÂ£;
When Thornton returned to Seattle
recently he had a big bank account
and calculated on giving his wife and
children a pleasant surprise. He suc
ceeded in astonishing her, but she
told him coldly that he had better go
away. He did so, but returned with
many toys for his children. The next
day he went again to the house and
had another talk with his ex- wife. It
appears that he wanted to inquire
into the regularity of the marriage.
What passed between" them 'is .'not,
known, but 'later Thornton was ar
rested on a' charge Of burglary, made
by his former wife. Thornton did not
go near the house after getting out on
bail, but appeared in court to-day, and
as Mrs. Allenby did not show up the
case was dismissed.

Special ; Dispatch Â¦ to The Call.
WASHINGTON,' 'April 20.â The Sen- 1
ate to-day listened to a set speech of
almost two hours' i. on, tho :
trusts by Senator *Dol*Hver and after
ward completed "consideration of' the
sundry, civil appropriation bill,, again
devoting much time to the ', provisions
for an extension of the east front of
the Capitol and for an additional office
building for the Senate. /,
Dolliver referred to the attitude of
the Democratic party toward the tariff,
saying that for the first time in our
national history since 1868 the policy of
protection stands approved, its enemies
themselves being the Judges, by the
common consent of the American peo
ple. He defended Republican policies
from the charge that they fostered
trusts, and said:
"There is only one sense in which the
protective tariff can be held responsible
for. the trusts, that is that without the
protective tariff there would have been
fewer industries to combine and there
fore fewer combinations." .
He declared that the effect of the
abolition of the tariff would be to turn
our markets and our industries over
to other nations. Dolliver, in closing,
said:' . '
"We approach this Presidential cam
paign united In the bonds of our his
toric faith. We did not originate it;
we Inherited it- from our fathers. If
changes are required to bring the tariff
law of 1897 into a more perfect relation
to the industrial progress of the Ameri
can: people, we propose to make them
ourselves whenever in our judgment
the work can be undertaken without
doing more harm, } than good, but we
shan not consent to any change which*
surrenders the rights of American la
bor,, which every; man- who makes, a
bona fide investment of his .money in
the United States ought to have over
his, competitors iri( other lands." .;
Consideration of the sundry civil bill
was resumed, the, immediate .question
being. an amendment for an office and
committee building for the Senate.
Stone and Stewart . supported 5 the
amendment and Newlands advocated a
postponement of the entire question
until it could be investigated by archi
tects. The amendment was agreed to.
The provision for, an. addition to the
east.front of * the Capitol . inserted by
the 'House and amended by the Senate
Committee on Appropriations was dis
cussed. Allison offered an amendment,
which was adopted,* limiting the Imme
diate appropriation . to | $75,000. The
amendment appropriating $71,000 as. the
share of the United: States of the cost
of the building to be erected In Wash
ington for the Bureau of -American
Republics Was adopted. \ â¢ â¢ ." '(Â¦
Senator Bacon offered and the Senate
accepted an amendment appropriating
$50,000 for the erection in % Washington
of a statue to Jefferson. He said he
desired to have the provision inserted
"as an antidote to : the provision for
the statue of Frederick the Great," and
he asked to have the provision insert
ed immediately after the paragraph re
lating to Frederick, .which was done. ;
The sundry ; civil , appropriation â¢ bill
was then passed as amended. ,

Present Senate Investigation Promises
to Develop Interesting F&cts.
SALT LAKE, April 20.â Some of the
interesting figures inside and outside
the Mormon church in Utah are to
give testimony before the Senate Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections
during the next few days. Revelations
are expected throwing considerable
more light on the practices of the Mor
mon church in polygamy and politics.
Among those who are to give testimony
are Former Judge Orlando W. Powers,
who, as United States Judge for the
Territory, sentenced many polygamlsts
to the penitentiary and who managed
the campaign which wrested Salt Lake
City from the control of the Mormons
in 1890. He will tell of Utah politics
from a gentile viewpoint.. Among the
Mormons* familiar with the inside
workings of the church there will be
Moses Thatcher, deposed apostle, and
Apostle John Henry Smith, the "politi
cal apostle." Brigham H. # Roberts,
John'Henry Smtth and Reed Smoot
are generally believed to have more
influence with President Joseph F.
Smith than any other persons. All
these will be asked about political con
ditions, but some of the witnesses will
be requested to tell about polygamous
relations entered. Into since the Wood

abandonment of polygamy.

MORMON LEADER AND HISQUES
TIONER BEFORE THE SENATE
INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE, t
Thatcher may be questioned closely
about the marriage relations of one of
his daughters, Clarice. It is said that
he opposed bitterly her becoming the
plural wife a couple of years ago of
Henry S. Tanner, a municipal Judge
in Salt Lake City. Tanner Is a leader
of the Young Men's Mutual Improve
ment Society of the Mormon church,
and is accused of having taken two
plural wives within the last few years.
Apostle John Henry Smith has al
ways been active In politics. He is a
cousin of the president of the church
and an active polygamlst. He was be
ing groomed for the Governorship four
years ago, but because of the rejection
of Roberts by Congress it was thought
advisable for the polygamists to keep
in the background for a while. Hence
he retired and let Heber M. Wells have
the office for'a second term. If Apostle
Smith can be induced to tell the, "truth,
the whole truth and. nothing but the
truth" he will throw a great deal of
light on conditions, . especially as re
gards polygamy and politics.)
L. E.- Abbott of Farmington, Utah,
will probably be questioned about the
polygamous practices of . two; of , the
apostles. Abbott Was formerly" Sheriff
of Davis County. In " the little 'village
of Farmington, a short distance north
of Salt Lake City, live some of â¢ the
plural' wives 'of Apostle John W.. Tay
lor. Abbott . knows "about ; them, j It is
charged that Taylor married ; two sis-
Vers, Roxle and Rhoda Willing, within
the last three years. Taylor is wanted
by ' the committee, but* he has escaped
As a result of their attitude during
this campaign. Thatcher and Roberts
were disciplined by the church.
Thatcher made a valiant fight for In
dependence and came within one vote
of being elected United States Senator.
The fchurch succeeded in electing Jo
seph L. Rawllns, preferring him, ah
apostate and an open opponent of the
church in politics, to 'one of their own
number who sought to maintain po
litical independence. Thatcher was de
posed from his church position and was
saved from excommunication only by
making a humble apology. It Is be
lieved he would have left the church
if he had been a monogamist. , As he
had more than one wife .and they
would have lost "all position In society
if he left the church and renounced Its
doctrine of polygamy, he humbled him
self and remained a Mormon. This
experience has left him a broken-spir
ited man, . however. It was a great
blow to the political independence of
individual Mormons.'
showing that at least two apostles re
cently took plural wives and that one
of the leaders among the young men
was presumably guilty of a similar
offense.
Judge Powers was appointed from
Michigan to the bench In Utah while
the prosecutions for polygamy under,
the Edmunds-Tucker law were at their
height. Ever since that time he has
been a conspicuous figure in Utah pub
lic life. After retiring from the bench
he became active in politics. The cam
paign In 1890 between the Liberal party,
or gentiles, and the People's party,' or
Mormons, In Salt Lake City was one
of the most picturesque and exciting
that ever took place. Judge Powers
was chairman of the Liberal campaign
committee. He won a decisive victory,
electing George M. Scott, a gentile busi
ness man. Mayor, and filling all the oth
er municipal offices with gentiles. Since
that time he has always been more or
less conspicuous during important cam
paigns. He was chairman of the Dem
ocratic State Committee during the
first campaign in Utah under state
hood. In that fight the Mormon church
violated its pledge, given only a few
months before, that it would never
again interfere in politics in any way.
The Democratic State Convention nom
inated John T. Calne for 'Governor and
Brigham H. Roberts for Congress, In
dorsing Moses Thatcher, then an apos
tle, for the United States Senate. The
Mormon hierarchy sent word to church
members throughout the State that
Thatcher and Roberts must be defeat
ed because they had accepted these
nominations without first securing the
consent of the first presidency and the
quorum of twelve apostles. Judge
Powers became conspicuous through
leading the combat against church in
fluence. The fight was unsuccessful
then, but he has been prominent on
that side ever since. Judge Powers is
a strong Senatorial possibility himself,
in case Utah should go Democratic this
fall.
DENVER. April 20.â The third day's
session of the executive council of the
American Federation of Labor was

matters of detail.

HARRIMAX FILES SUIT.
NEW YORK, April 20.â A report was
circulated to-day in_this city to the
effect that a new suit had been started
against the. Northern Securities Com
pany, and | that an order, in the suit,
signed by Justice Geigerisch of the Su
preme Court, had been issued, return
able to-morrow, but Justice Geigerisch
said he had not signed any such. order.
This new suit was said to have been
instituted by C. H. Venner of Boston,
who was interested in the suit brought
by the Continental Securities Company,
whose application for an injunction
against to-morrow's meeting of the
Northern Securites Company ' and
against the announced method for -dis

WASHINGTON. April 20.â With the
reopening of the investigation in the
Reed Smoot case before the Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
the prosecution devoted considerable
time to drawing: from Brigham H. Rob
crts the character of the oaths which
are said to be necessary for a Mormon
official to take in order to have the!
support of the church for political of-'
flees. Members of the committee showed
an equal interest in the obligations
which are said to be taken by Mormons
who " S o through the endowment
house." Along both lines much evi
dence was brought out. It was shown
by Roberts' testimony that without the
consent of the Mormon church he failed
of. election to a seat in Congress, and
later, with church recognition of his
candidacy, he was elected.
In relation to the endowment-house
bbligation Roberts was extremely reti
cent. He said that the sacredne'ss of
the secrecy was such that he could not
reveal it to the world, and that if he
did so he would lose caste with the
church ag having betrayed a trust.
Portions of the testimony given by
Roberts, especially in regard to his rea
sons for maintaining polygamous co
habitation with his plural wives, was
I almost a duplication of the testimony
piven by other polygamists who have
been on the stand. He said he regard
ed the laws of God as higher than the
laws of the land, and that his moral
obligation to his wives was greater
than both the laws of God and the laws
of men.
TELLS OF HIS MARRIAGES.
In response to questions by Tayler,
Roberts said his first plural marriage
was performed by D. H. Wells, counsel
to the apostles, and he thought the cer
emony was performed at the home of
Wells' son.
Senator Overman inquired of Roberts
whether his first wife and his second
wife had consented to his marriage
to his third wife.
"No, sir," said Roberts.
Continuing, he said they did not learn
of the marriage for three or.four years.
"How was that?" asked Senator Bev
| eridge. "Do you mean to say that the
marriage was not known to any one?"
"It was known to some of my friends,
but not to my wives." was the answer.
"Why was this marriage concealed
from them?" asked Chairman Bur
rows.
"Because I did not want to embar
rass them."
"How embarrass them?"
"Well, we knew the marriage was
illegal and it might be embarrassing
to them if they should for any reason
be called to testify."
CLANDESTINE COURTSHIP.
Roberts said his third wife was the
divorced wife of Dr. Shipp, and in re
gard to his courtship he said he al
ways had met her at the house of mu
tual friends and had never called on
her at her home. He also said that
she continued to live in her home, but
that he never had called on her there
until she removed to rooms on Main
street, Salt Lake.
Tayler asked Roberts why he thought
it incumbent upon him to take plural
wives.
"From boyhood," replied the witness,
"I had been taught the rightfulness of
plural marriages and I believed this
practice to be the law of God. I knew
that this practice was contrary to the
' mandates of Congress, but believed
! that the law of God was the highest
rule, and I felt impelled to o&ey it."
BELIEVES IX POLYGAMY.
Chairman Burrows asked a number
of pointed questions, which brought
; the confession from Roberts that he
still believed in and was practicing
Â¦ polygamy. He said he believed the
; Woodruff manifesto was divinely in
! spired and that now, in practicing
polygamy, he knew he was disobeying
both the laws of the land and the laws
of God. He was asked why he con

f it. There are more deaths
from starvation than the world
dream* oC When the stomach is dis-
eased and the food eaten is not digested
and assimilated, then the strength of the
body begins to fail because of lack of
nutrition, and the weak body falls an
easy victim to the microbes of disease.
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
rures diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion and nutrition. It
restores physical strength in the only
possible way. by enabling the assimila-
tion of the nutrition contained in food.
"I was Â«iclc for orer three yean; with a com-
plication of etomach troubles." write* Mr. John
H. Castona, raidin? at 3^42 Arch St., Chicago,
Illinois. "Had tried Â«rery good plivsican I
knew of, Â¦â¢ well as many patent medicines, but
received only temporary relief. Oae dav a

ran its use. Commencea to j^in the first week,

to announce th*t I am as well and healthy as

will be cross-examined by Attorney
Gibson. ......
"And you have broken that word of
Jionor, have you not?" asked Attorney
Gibson.
The Chief took Alexander's star from
him and placed him under suspension.
In the previous trial the'^wnson
woman refused to testify and was com
mitted to Jail for contempt. Finally
she look the stand and reluctantly told
a story that was damaging to the de
fendant]
During yesterday's trial Chief Witt
man, Captain Martin, Lieutenant Glee
ton and Lulu Wilson gave testimony
substantially the same as In the first
trial. - -
Witt man testified that he paid the
weman ?20 for her services and gave
his worfl that he would not drag her
into the trial.
"S^or the second <ime former Pdlice
"nran Ernest Alexander is on trial on a
charge of having accepted a bribe from
a 'fallen woman. Lulu Wilson, now
known as Mrs. Mamie Lin of Los An
ertles.
In the orevious trial the jury dis
agreed, and Alexander has since been
enjoying his liberty on bail.
The complaint alleges that Alexan
der while acting as patrolman in the
redlig:ht district accepted a. bribe from
ooe of the creatures who made her liv
ing on his beat. Further, It saÂ» that
the policeman forced her to pay tribute
to him at the rate of $2 50 per week un
der penalty of arrest.
' Becoming tired of such treatment, the
woman complained to Chief of Police
Witt man. and he, with Captain of De
tet-tlves Martin, set a trap for Alex
ander. The efffters took up a position
\n a room in a downtown restaurant
where they could watch proceedings,
pave some marked coin to the woman
and told her to seek Alexander and
bribe him if possible.
The Wilson woman signaled that she
had accomplished her purpose, where
upon Cartain Martin went out and
brought the patrolman to the room
v;Jiere hif* chief w-asÂ« in waiting. Witt
man demanded that Alexander pro
duce what money he had in his posses
sion, and showed him that three of the
coins had been sent to him through the
woman. Â¦

ception and banquet are to be tendered

dental Hotel. Covers for 275 will' be

The report â¢ says that the * proposed
change is a desirable one and will per
mlt of much better service. The three ;
franchises^ for the entire road, which
expire in 1911, 1929 and 1944 respective- [
ly, permit of the use of electricity ex
cept on that portion between Parker
and First avenues and the corporation
expects to secure this right from the
Supervisors. The proposed poles are
wooden, but the Engineering Bureau
says that the poles on California street
from Presidio to Parker^g^fcvenues
should be of iron and modern girder
rails should be used in the track con
struction. On the outer section, where
but few Improvements have been made,
and where the franchise has but seven
years to run. ..the. wooden poles may
quite properly be used.
The S. Ducas Company donated a
piece of land running off Folsom street.
near-Precita avenue, for the purpose of
a street, to /be called Bessie avenue.
The City Attorney will be asked for
an opinion as to whether the street
can be dedicated as such.
CHIMNEY A NUISANCE.
The Bureau of Engineering reported
that the chimney of the Sanitary Re
duction Works is 'inadequate in itself
to carry off fumes and . smoke. The
report continues:
"So long as the garbage is as Im
perfectly consumed as it Is at present
and no proper attempt is made to se'
cure a complete combustion of the of
fensive matter, so long will the Sani
tary Reduction Works continue to be
an inexcusable nuisance, not only to
neighboring property, but to property
a mile or two away. This state of af
fairs existing in the center of our city
can and should be remedied." j
The Bureau of Engineering recom
mended that the Standard Oil Com
pany be granted a permit to lay a
six-inch oil pipe line on Sixteenth
street, but action .was postponed until
next PVidfty. . "v ''Â¦
The Bureau of Engineering reported i
that the lighting of exit lamps in |
theaters by independent circuit of elec
tricity is preferable to lighting by oil
and equally safe, provided proper safe- \
guards be employed. Should it be de- i
cided to use only oil lamps it Is recom
mended that an oil equally as safe as '
mineral sperm oil be exacted.
The board Â¦ recommended that the
width of sidewalks <nn Devisadero
stret \betwpen Duboce avenue and
Fourteenth street be fixed at ten feet.
The Bureau of Engineering filed a re
port relative to the petition of the
United Railroads to reconstruct and
electrize its tracks on California street
from Presidio avenue to Thirty-second
avenue, . thence. t through private lands
to the Cliff Houie.
ELECTRIZING OF ROAD.
The Bureau of Engineering complained
of damage being done to the pavement
on. New Montgomery -street . by the
careless handling of oil in transferring
the same from the tank wagons to re.
ceivlng tanks, and f the" contractor.'fur
nishing the oil will be notified to" use
care in the matter. ..->*Â¦â¢ Â¦â¢" Â¦â¢'â¢
The petition of the Laborers' Protec
tive Union that the city do its own
street sweeping and the sweepers be
paid $2 50 per day was referred to the
engineering bureau.
The petition of property owners on
Richland avenue, South avenue and
East Park street Â£hat they be allowed
to have their side sewers put in under
contract was taken under advisement.
D. Cotter, a builder, stated that the
work could be done more cheaply in that
way than by the Board of Works,
which denied the assertion. G. Round
ey intimated that a charter amendment
would be submitted to the people to
take the work out of the hands of the
Board of Works. -f ......
Mrs. G. L. Smith, president of the
California Club, appeared before the
Board of Public Works yesterday and
urged that body to grant permits to
sell flowers on the sidewalks desig
nated by the recently enacted ordin
ance establishing free public flower
markets. The board held that the or
dinance is illegal and therefore permits
could not be granted under it, but defi
nite, action on the matter was post
poned.
The board recommended that Mission
street, from Second td Third, be re
paired at a cost of 511,900. The esti
mate is made to include reconstruction
of curbs to the official sidewalk width
of fifteen feet, which will result in the
widening of the roadway eight feet- ,
The petition of employes at the street
sweeping bunkers^ for an increase of
wages to $SM) per month was taken un
der advisement. ~â

strikers. The latter have disconnected
the telegraph' instruments at .various
points, severing communication.

President Holland, except for hi* hur
ried trip through the corridor,, was In
visible yesterday. When a request for
an interview was sent to him after the
adjournment of the conference he sent
Treasurer Starr to say that the com
pany had nothing whatever to say.
This morning at 10 o'clock the repre
sentatives of the company and those of
its employes will meet again to exam
ine the artic^s of agreement prepared
last night under the supervision of Gen
eral Manager Chapman and Tirey L.
Ford, attorney for the . United Rail
roads. If they shall prove satisfactory
to those in the conference the articles
will be submitted to the men.
Whether or not these shall be consid
ered as sufficient concessions by the
United Railroads will depend upon the
men.
From Mahon It was learned that
some form of an -agreement had been
reached' in the conference, the accept
ance of which will rest entirely with
the men affected when they meet to
night. The exact terms have-not been
put in -written language, but each sec
tion of the agreement between the
United Railroads and its employes has
been clearly defined. The sections com
prise forty-three in all and deal with
all the questions brought up at , the
previous strike In addition to two new
clauses. These latter are said to relate
to a flat rate of 27 cents per hour, .to
which the company Is said to have
agreed, and a straightaway hour, propo
sition, with allowances for overtime of
ten hours' labor.
RESTS WITH THE MEN.'
Eventually the room was vacated,
one by one drifting out. First came
Richard Young, . representative of
Brown Bros., the New York bankers
who underwrote the bonds for $20.0<>0,
000, which financed the purchase of the
holdings of the United Railroads. He
was on his way to New York via the
elevator and had only time to reach
his hotel and pack. He knew absolutely
nothing, but his avowed departure for
the East was the first signal of an
agreement between the contending del
egations. Young is not a man to quit
a field when the Issue is doubtful.
Next came International President
Mahon, Local President Cornelius and
Thomas Bolan of the Carmen's Union.
Mahon was suave and tactful as usual.
Cornelius, suffering under an accumu
lation of boils, was more than usually
reticent Bolan bluntJy announced he
had nothing to say. - - Â¦
Inion Will Meet to Deter
mine on Acceptance of the
Terms Offered by Company
Whether or not there will be a strike
by the streetcar operators in this city
will be determined at the union meet
ing of the men which will probably be
held to-night. They will pass upon the
terms offered by the United Railroads
of San Francisco under which they
must labor or quit. - .
The end of the conferences between
the toilers, represented by their Inter
national president, their local president
and one of the operatives on oi^* side
and the officials of the United Kail
road^ on the other, ended at 6 o'clock
last night. Both sides were pledged to
secrecj'. and none of the participants
was willing to leak a drop of informa
tion. Whatever became public indi
cates that the United Railroads is of
fering terms upon the acceptance of
which industrial peace for its present
employes and the convenience of the
San Francisco public depend.
After a morning session of the con
ference lasting from 10 to 12 o'clock and
an afternoon confab that consumed
five hours. President' Holland of the
United Railroads fluttered through the
corridors ol the eighth floor of the
Rtalto building, where the company's
offices are. He held in his hand a few
sheets of paper and smiled pleasantly
as he disappeared into an office where
a typewriter . immediately got busy.
Then he came back with a typed docu
ment in his hand, .still smiling and
went into the conference room again.

Gould interests, was \ retired; arid v the
office of general "counselor, held .by
Max Pam of New York,, who also repre

was,- abolished.' The' office"* of 'general
counsel paid -a- salary, of . $15,000 a year.
' 'Gould, it is stated; will' retain 'his po

Gets a Rehearing
Move Is Believed to Por/
tend Attempt by Holland
to Gain Control of the Road
Since December, as the natural con
sequence of this* move, the Pacific
Coast has been flooded with represen
tatives of Middle West jobbing houses,
who have succeeded in getting away a
considerable volume of trade from the
Pacific Coast jobbers. This benefit the
Middle West jobbers did not share
Â¦with the retailers, but kept it 'all for
themselves. The Pacific Coast Manu
facturers' and Jobbers* Association
took the matter up recently with the
transcontinental railroad officials and
the entire facts were discussed at
length. It is said that the railroad
men were anxious to find a way for
restoring the carload rate on liquors.
The decision has been reached now to
give the carload rate again. As a re
sult the liquor men of the coast will
be happy, as the decision once more
secures to them the trade of the coast.
ThV transcontinental railroads will
pnt into effect on April 25 a tariff of
rrÂ«at Interest to the liquor men of the
Pacific Coast. Thereby the differential
on liquors in wood .will be restored.
Nothing is more important to the Pa
cific Coast, by reason of its situation
on the remote edge of the . continent,
than the continuance of the carload
rate on freight, that permits Jobbers
to bring out goods in large quantities
at & lower cost than that charged to
the Middle "VTest Jobber on the ship
ment of small quantities*. The Pacific
Coast differential permits the Pacific
Coast retailer and consumer to share
In the benefit obtained by the Pacific
Coast Jobber.
This is the essential point that was
raised in the famous case in which the
St. Louis Jobbers were beaten in their
contention with the Jobbers of this
coast before the Interstate Commerce
Commission. Last December the car
load rate on liquors of all kinds in
wood was withdrawn by the trans
continental railroads and an "any
quantity" rate took the place of it.
The reason assigned for this by the
railroad people was that the carload
rate had been Juggled by the assem
bling of small quantities of liquors,
constituting mixed carloads. This
Aversion of the traffic men to mixing
drinks resulted, as had been said. In
thÂ« withdrawal of the carload rate on
liquor* in wood.

WORD comes from San Jose that a big project for
the construction of several interurban electric
railways in Santa Clara County is already, un
der way. With San Jose as the center, it is the reported
purpose of the capitalists who are behind the scheme to
construct- a network of. traction lines which will extend
to Los Gatos via Campbell, connect Berryessa and. Ever
green with'the base of the system and open up a route
to Palo Alto by way of Santa Clara. According to ad
vices the sum of $75,000 has already been pledged by
local and San Francisco capitalists for the prosecution
of the plans and it is almost a definite surety that before
long constructive operations will be commenced.
The news of an undertaking such as this comes as a
distinct augury of good to the country which is to be
the field of the extensive traction system proposed. Al
ready there is :nearing completion a. similar line of rail
way which is to connect Hollister and AVatsonville with
the ccast. and provide the fruit raisers of the Pajaro Val
ley with a direct freight service with San Francisco
through an auxiliary steamer line from Port Rogers.

A New York paper, prints a cable
gram from Zanzibar, East Africa,
which tells of a remarkable "collision"
which occurred on the Uganda rail
road that would be possible nowhere
else on earth. A huge bull rhinoceros
rushed from the bush and charged at
full speed at the so-called "up mixed"
train, which was slowing down, Febru
ary 14, as it approached! 1 the v station
Sultan Hamond, 218 miles from Mom
basa, on the coast, where the road
starts. It was still dark, just before
daylight. The train was * traveling
eight or ten miles an hour when the
infuriated pachyderm attacked It on
the flank. . ... ;Â» .
Perhaps the great brute had been
aroused from sleep by, the greater mon
ster, whose one big shining eye nearly
blinded him.* But the rhinoceros, lord
of the region, caring nothing for. the
huge bulk of the unknown intruder,
hurled itself upon it. The engineer felt
a series of shocks, of which the first
was so violent as to throw two passen
gers from. their sleeping berths to the
floor. The train was stopped and the
passengers turned out, most of them
in their "robes of night" and some of
triem badly scared. The "rhino" was
discovered about . 100 yards down the
track. The Impact with the train had
felled him, but had not cooled his rage.
Slowly he raised himself and stood de
fiantly shaking his head.
Some of the more "sporting" passen
gers got their f ifles and opened fire on
the rhinoceros,' but the light was uncer
tain, and probably the "mighty beast
was not hit. Slowly he returned to the
jungle and was lost sight of. He did
not escape unharmed from the strange
encounter, for pieces* of his thick skin
were femnd adhering. to the train. But

At a banquet given a few evenings
since by a local court of Foresters one
of the Superior Judges of this city, who
Is a member of the court, was called
upon to respond to "The Golden State."
He spoke at some length of the pio
neers of California and their trials and
then said: "Those pioneers were a pe
culiar people in one sense of the word â
they formed. a fraternity such as never
before or since existed. It was a fra
ternity that was ready at all times to
help each one who belonged to it with
out question and without reserve. It
was not a fraternity of limited contri
butions in case of need, but one of
whole-souled donations."
The next speaker, an old-time Cali
foAlan, was called upon to respond to
"Fraternity," and he took up the line
of thought of the Judge, saying: "I re
member well the fraternity spoken of
Jiy the Judge. Every one was welcome
o belong to it without initiation, .but
he had to be what he represented him
self to be, and woe betide him if he
made a false pretense. If he pretended
to be a doctor and proved to be a
quack he was not brought before an
arbitration committee for trial upon
charges formulated in legal form, but
he was waited upon by â¢ a committee
that told . him that the fraternity had
decided that by reason of his false rep
resentations - he . % was ; not a desirable
member and that he had just six hours
to get out of the place.- If he was found
in the place, at the .expiration of the
time limit- he was not. given a second
notice. The committee simply marched
him to the nearest tree and hanged
him. That is the way that fraternity
got rid of undesirable members."

THE New York Times says that Hearst has been
recorded on only five roll calls during this session
of Congress, and that when present in -the House
he "sits on the small of his back with one knee in the
air." What would the Times have? Does it expect him
to sit on his shoulders with both knees in the air?. He
sets the fashion, and soon the minority side of the House
may be resting on its rear gallus buttons, with one knee
up for each member.
The Times also affirms that Mr. Hearst is "shy, and
suffers 'in -the presence of men." Just what form his
sufferings take before the face of his own sex is not
stated. He is described as mixing with no one, in the
House, and during the sole debate that kept him in his
seat, that on the eight hour bill, he issued orders to his
lieutenants as if they were details to reporters, and when
it was over he put his hands in his pockets and slouched
out of the chamber. ' Â¦ â¢
These Plutarchian particulars about the ways and man
ners of the great are interesting. The admirers of the
tenderloin member have, in . some of the back districts,
attacked Speaker Cannon .for not putting him on more
prominent committees, intimating that it was feared his
light would so shine before men that they would fly to
it as moths to the night lamp. Therefore, the Speaker
put it under a bushel. But Uncle Joseph has not been
in politics sixty years for nothing. When the Democrats
selected Mr. Williams as their floor leader, he gave that
gentleman the" task of assigning the minority to com
mittees, and every Democrat is placed just where his
own leader put him.
Williams made up the minority of the Committee on
Labor, and when Hearst wanted that place was com
pelled to decline to put him there. One of the,Demo
crats made way for him by resigning and in that way he
landed on the committee. When he wanted the McClel
lan vacancy on the Ways and Means, Williams, refused
arid-'gave it-to Cockran. In every case Mr. Hearst has
worked from the outside, bringing* pressure to bear on
Williams from labor organizations and Hearst clubs.
But the Mississippian is a hard, formation and refuses to
be influenced. . Whether this has anything to do with
Hearst's infrequent presence in his seat, and with his
sitting on the small of his back when there, is unknown.

quaint little club of English grirl
writers. With two exceptions, all the
members of the "Magpie Club" live in
the country. But the English coun
try is not like the American country#
ana it would be hard for an American
grirl to realize the seclusion in which
these young writers have been brought
up. Most of them are clergymen's
daughters, living in village rectories,
and until they were "discovered" in a
manner to be hereafter described had
depended almost entirely on the
classics for their reading and had not
even heard of current periodicals as
famous as Harper's and the Strand
magazines. Of these girls five were
acquainted to begin with. All of them
wrote stories in an aimless sort of
way, which they showed to each other,
end gradually this little circle widen
ed until it included nine or ten mem
bers. These ' formed the "Magpie
Club" and then came the idea of the
Magpie Magazine. The girls found a
woman friend who was willing to act
as secretary and to her each "Magpie"
sent every month a piece of fiction
signed with her nom de plume. These
were written on paper of a uniform
size and when all 'the contributions
vere received they were stitched to
gether and bound in a permanent
cover bearing the name, "The Magpie
Magazine." The magazine,, by the
way, included a number of blank
jages, upon which criticisms were to
be written, and after it was bound the
periodical was sent in turn to each
member of the club, who read it and
then set down in it her opinion of its
various items. I have read a number
of . these criticisms and _ to describe
them as "free" and "outspoken"
would be drawing it mild indeed.
They were the most striking example
about the Magpie apart from the
really unconynon literary quality of its
contents. Mc?t of the stories in the
JJagpie, too, rt-vealed a knowledge of
life on the part of their authors which
was really startling when one con
sidered these girls' environment.
â¢ * â¢
The Magpie Magazine had existed in
this way for a year or two before the
girl discovered it who was eventually
to Introduce the "Magpies" to the
reading public. This was Miss Con
stance Smedley, whose novel, "An
April Princess" â recently a success in
America â was not then published, but
who already had attracted attention
by her short stbrirs, dramatic criti
cisms and the one-act play of hers
which was produced by Mrs. Patrick
Campbell. Mi^s Smedley became a;
qualnted with Miss Agno<Â» Weekes,
whose novel, "Yarborough, the Pre
m'er,"-has just t< en -publlsned, 'anl,
through her wUh the MagDie Club, of
which Miss WÂ»2i:e.3 Is a member.
'A regular feature of the Magpie
Magazine Is a serial story. "Yar
borough, the Premier," ran in the Mag
pie, and to it Miss Smedley, M'ho soon
became an enthusiastic member of the
club, contributed her "April Princess."
Oddly enough, in spite of the amount
of writing that was done by the "Mag
pies" not one of them ever had thought
of publishing their stories. Miss Smed
ley. however, after having read a few
numbers of "The Magpie" told, herself
that the stories therein were distinctly
salable. Among the Magpie produc
tions which struck her as perhaps most
promising were three novels which had
run as serials in the amateur maga
zine â "Yarborough, the Premier," by
Miss A. R. Weekes. "Love in Chief,"
by her Bister, Miss R. K." Weekes. and
"Lance in Rest," by Miss L. A. Talbot.
The . Harpers had recently published
Miss Smedley's book of essays, "The
Boudoir Critic," and so this young
writer advised her Magpie friends to
send their books to the American firm.
They followed her advice and the three
romances were accepted almost Im
mediately. Another Magpie novel, "The
New Eden," found a publisher in
Dublin, and the early notices oÂ£ it
have been flattering. One reviewer, in
fact, declared that at last a successor
to "The Duchess" had appeared. Mis3
Smedley tells me that a j number of
short stories originally contributed to
the Magpie Magazine have been liter
ally snapped up by different London
periodicals, and says that the files of
the periodical -written by these English
rlrls for their own amusement con
tain much work that needs only to be
made public to be recognized as un
commonly . good.

able Jeweler. The diamonds of St.
Petersburg are famous. Your represen
tative was dazzled by a succession of
solid precious stones whose weight
could only be reckoned in avoirdupois.
"The jewels one sees at Covent Gar
den are slim and puny baubles by com
parison. St.' Petersburg seems to buy
its diamonds by the pound and the
wealth of 'Orrauz and of Ind* scintil
lates in the ears and round the slender
throats of its fair women.
"Where the great ladies of Russia
are not beautiful, they are vivacious.
Most often they are beautiful, but vi
vacity is their supreme distinction.
Their faces are animated; when they
speak they live their words and the
bored look of London and the weighty
amiability of Berlin are nowhere visi
ble. .Theirs is a certain primitive
health that not even several cubic
inches of diamond and a Paris gown
can dislocate.
"To tell the truth your representa
tive, much as he admitted the beauty
of St. Petersburg Â¦womanhood, was
even more enchanted with the men.
Such men! These had made quite raV
ishing toilets. The Cossacks of the
Guard would give quality and savor to
any gathering. Picture to yourselves
bronzed . and bearded heroes In ankle
long overalls, cartridges made of silver
filigree work running along their
breasts, Oriental swords and yataghans
hanging on belts of silver,. and crosses
and medals won on strange battlefields
nestling below the cartridges. -With
these were generals whose wide trous
ers were met by leather boots knee
high. All Wore their ordersâ crosses in
brilliants, in enamel or in gold, rows
of them. In England one would put
the alphabet after their names.
"Hussars, Infantry, artillery, dra
goons, and riflemen were all here, frosc
ged and braided and astrachaned and
decorated. " Smart students, sword on
hip, mingled with these and the mere

a string of decorations in miniature on

"Yes, sir," replied Gilmartin, with a

heard that name." .
"Are you "not Gilmartin?" he said
when the sailor stood in front of his
desk.
"Yep, sir," said the tar, pleased at the
recognition. ' "I was with you on the
Saranac twenty years ago."
Some months ago a big, strapping
sailor was working about the ordnance
building. Captain Drake noticed him
and sent a messenger to summon him
to the office.
Captain Drake, chief of the bureau of
ordnance at the Aiare Island Navy
Yard, has such a good memory that he
is able -to call by name nearly every
enlisted man who has ever been "ship
mate" with him. He has not been on
sea duty for quite a few years, but oc
casionally while making a tour of the
navy yard he sees some bluejacket who
served on a vessel with him, say, twen
ty years ago. Then in answer to the
Jackie's salute Captain Drake gives a
pleasant smile, returns the salute and
says: "Jackson, isn't it? You were with
me on the Saginaw?" or. "Wilson, what
are you on now?"

aversion to them any species of cru

such a prodigious outcry... A- lost or

and the cat did not take kindly to the
new house. It wandered away several
times, but was recovered when re
wards were offered. About two years
ago, however, it vanished . entirely.
After much red tape business the au
thorities decided that the cat might be
presumed to be legally dead and paid
over tbe>\capital to the institution on
receipt of a solemn undertaking to
provide for it, as originally stipulated,
should it ever turn up again.
"The proper way to. eat cats is to
roast them In. an oven, until brown,
with onions, garlic, parsley, bay leaf,
red wine and some herbs peculiar to
Italy. They are not nearly so good
when boiled. As food English bred
cats are not to be compared with
Italian cats. The latter are much bet
ter cared for and fed on the best milk.
I tried an English cat once, but that
was enough. I have never eaten an
other." ,
In Northern Italy, according to an
Italian resident in London, cats are
regarded as a dainty among the. poor
people and, the state forbidding their
sale for food, they are called "rab
bits" by the butchers.
"They Â¦ are -.bought , as rabbits and
eaten as cats," said the Italian.; "I
have eaten them many a time and. can
vouch for it that they taste much bet
ter than the English hare, the meat
being exceedingly tender and as
sweet as a nut Many .people in
Italy keep cats as the English do rab
bitsâto kill and eaL And * their
skins are worth more than those of
rabbits.
gastronomic eccentricities as sufficient
justification for the summary dispos
session of a tenant who pays his rent,
the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals has taken the mat
ter In hand to protect London's prowl
ing felines from the gridiron and stew
pot of this alien invader. For several
nights a dozen of its most skillful and
trusted agents have been* stalking the
squares of Bloomsbury, where the cat
eater is reputed to do his hunting, in
the hope of catching him red-handed,
but thus far he has succeeded in
eluding their vigilance. As an official
of the society explained, it is a diffi
cult matter to prove the guilt of a man
who swallows the evidence of his
crimes. It is reported that the society
for the protection of stray and home
less cats, of which her â¢ Grace the
Duchess of Bedford is president, in
tends enlisting a large force of ama
teur detectives in the pursuit by offer
ing a substantial reward for the arrest
and conviction of this ruthless de
stroyer of feline felicity. ]
Meanwhile the whole" grewsome story
of what led to the landlord's futile
appeal to a police court has been re
vealed. With a friend the sojourner
from sunny Italy was returning home
about midnight when, crossing Rus
sell^ Square, he espied a fine Thomas
cat engaged" in serenading a female
tabby.
"What a lovely stew he would make."
he remarked, and then to the amaze
ment of his companion he crept
stealthily forward and suddenly pr?b
bed the unsuspecting animal by the
tail. Swing-ing it in the air he dashed
its head against a curbstone and in
another minute had resumed his way
homeward with the dead cat tucked
under his arm. Half way down Guil
ford street another cat was encoun
tered and with an adroitness which
bespoke long practice was similarly
captured and dispatched.
About noon the following day the
landlord noticed his lodger making
preparations for a meal and casually
asked him what he had for dinner.
"One of the finest rabbits that was
ever eaten," was the response.
Having previously skinned the ani
mal the lodger even permitted the un
suspecting landlord to see how. he
cooked It. As a gastronomic curios
ity the recipe is worth recording.
First the- Italian cook.. took a quantity
of onions chopped very fine and mixed
with garlic and parsley. | These he
boiled with butter in a stewpan,_and
then added pieces of the animal cut
up as is customary with a rabbit. Over
the dish he sprinkled flour, poured in
a bottle of claret, allowed the mixture
to simmer over the fire for three quar
ters of an hour and ate it with great
relish. Next day he had another "rab
bit" for dinner. It was the discovery
of the skins that gave the thing away
to the horrified landlord. And in turn
the Italian was astonished that hiÂ«?
partiality for cats as an article of
diet, should be regarded with abhor
rence. How anybody who would eat
with relish an animal of such notori
ously filthy habits as a pig could turn
up his nose at a cat which performs
its ablutions several times a day was
beyond his comprehension. But the
Italian's logic was lost on the British
landlord. He ordered his tenant to
leave at once, and when the tenant re
fused had recourse post haste to a
magistrate to learn that British law
was on the side of one who chose to
regard his temporary j lodgings as his
castle for the time being.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
5* HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON. April 9.âAl
though the proprietor of ' a London
boarding-house who applied to a magi
strate for a" writ of ejectment against
an Italian tenant on the ground that
he killed and ate cats, discovered that
English law does not recognize such
W Bugaboo for Pussies.
THE New York Sun is quite violent in its opposition
to President Roosevelt, and misses no chance to
advise ways and means to effect his defeat. Its
counsel was evidently followed in making the placeboic
platform of the New York Democratic convention. The
Sun declares: "The usurpation of power by Congress
has never been so outrageous as since McKinley's death.
What is needed most of all is to put the ship of state
back again on the right tack and compel it to be steered
hereafter as the constitution has prescribed. Give back,
to the State governments and prohibit to the National
Government the regulation of things which Marshall de
clared do not come under National cognizance, and all
will be well. The three Democratic Justices of the Su
preme Court have recently, by the vivid pen of Justice
White, declared the boundary line between State and Na
tional affairs. Does the Democracy intend to vindicate
or repudiate, that boundary line?"
If the New York convention, set the pace Justice
White will probably be followed. But this being so, what
is the fuss about? The much-respected boundary/on
which the Sun shines, in order that it may be distinctly
seen, is on the hither side of the interstate commerce
and Sherman anti-trust laws. Yet the Sun says that if
that boundary be respected, "Difficulties over corpora
tions, trusts, labor, capital and interstate commerce will
disappear from' Congress and will trouble it no more
than marriage and divorce."
So, it appears that the simple recipe for taking away
all trouble, about those issues, from Congress, is by de
nying National jurisdiction over them in any form. While
labor and capital are thrown in for padding, the real
issues are the trusts and , interstate commerce. When
did Marshall "decide that Congress has no jurisdiction
over interstate "commerce? The Sherman anti-trust law
derives all of its vigor from that clause of the constitu
tion which gives Congress the power to regulate com
merce between the Stales. The Supreme Court held
that this means that Congress may use that power as
prescribed in the interstate commerce law. If not by
such means, how? What power is given the States* to
regulate commerce beyond their own borders?
The constitution grants powers to the Federal Gov
ernment, and prohibits them to the States. Its proper
interpretation is that the Federal Government may ex
el cise all the powers granted to it, and the States all that
are not prohibited to them. In the nature of things, one
State cannot project its regulative power within the
jurisdiction of another State. If this were possible, Cali
fornia could regulate the domestic commerce of Nevada,
prescribe the rates of transportation in that State and in
every waj' interfere in that alien jurisdiction. No State,
in other words, can assume power's granted to the Fed
eral Gpvernment, nor can it go beyond that grant in
the invasion of powers not prohibited to the States. The
regulation of interstate commerce by the States them
selves is, therefore, an impossibility.
Trusts affect interstate commerce and are, therefore,
subject to Federal regulation. They may also be regu
lated within the jurisdiction of a State, by. its .authority,
in so far as they affect its domestic commerce. To illus
trate: If the Standard Oil Company uproot-competition
in, California by a reduction. of rates below the cost of
production, at a competing point, it is entirely competent
for the- State to enact that it shall sell everywhere within
the State at 1 the same rate, and shall not again raise its
rates anywhere within the State without the assent of
public authority. That would be : a proper exercise of lo
cal jurisdiction. But suppose the" Standard Oil Company
affect interstate commerce and suppress interstate com
petition, by a conspiracy with railroads by which it se-i
cures- exclusive rebates in' freight, where is. the power
in a State to prevent it? Only the Federal Government
has that authority, and has used it in the interstate com
merce law. " *
From this digest of the' matter it appears that the Sun
sees in Justice White's opinion judicial politics, which
by reviving the obsolete issue of State rights, as these
were understood before the Civil War, will take the
Federal grip from the throats of trusts and corporations,
undef the. pretense that they, can be choked by the States.
The good understanding between the Sun and its trust
clients was established in the New York Democratic con
vention. Its platform cries out against "usurpation" and
"alarms that check industrial growth," and that "cor
porations chartered by the State must be subject to just
regulation by the State, in the interest of the people; no
Â¦government partnership with protected monopolies.".
If all that mean anything, it means. that every trust,
being incorporated under State law, shall submit only to
State control, and that the sole Federal control is by re
moving tariff- protection from everything in which a
trust can deal. It is a Sangrado prescription, which peo
ple will refuse to take.
systems is rcmething which. must come . to the State if
we would keep abreast of the times. In the south they
have caught the Eastern idea quite thoroughly, and Los
Angeies and vicinity ?has a network of electric lines
which is well' in the fore with similar systems in the
New England States. Back in Massachusetts and Con
necticut the country freight- service has been transferred
from the steam railroads to the electric lines to a de
gree which makes the latter almost the sole carriers of
local produce. When all, of our bay cities are united
by a complete electric railway system we will witness
a reve.'opnjent of the country along the several. routes
which will be astonishing. . . /

That the skull of a colored man is not
absolutely damage-proof, tradition to
the contrary notwithstanding, was
demonstrated by four deep incisions in
the head of Thomas Thompson, a thor
oughbred negro, which had been made
with an iron "knuckle duster" attached
to the right hand of Walter Parker,
also of African ancestry. Mr. Thomp
son tried to convince Judge Cabaniss
that the attack upon his cranium was
unprovoked a"nd uncalled for, but sev
eral dusky witnesses for^the defense
proved the infliction of the wounds was
to be commended rather than deplored,
inasmuch as It was an act of gallantry.
Miss Rita Splnosa, of light tan com
plexion, was the lady in whose behalf
Parker applied the "knuckle duster."
She was one of the attractions of a Pa
cific street saloon frequented by Ethio
pian aristocrats and Caucasian degen
erates, and when Mr. Thompson de
clined her Invitation to buy exhilarat
ing beverages for two she expressed
the opinion that he was "no good no
how." He resented the uncompliment
ary criticism by slapping her face, and
It was then'that Mr. Parker introduced
his "knuckle duster." J
"Ef I hedn't intahfeahed w'en I did,

Miss Spinosa and Miss Mabel Hell. The

at Miss Spinosa condescending to ask
"sech a no 'count niggah" as Mr.
Thompson to treat her to liquids. V
-"The bulk of the testimony is with
you, Mr. Parker," said the Judge, "and
if you can satisfactorily explain why
you armored your* knuckles to smite
the complainant I may let you down
easy."

Fifteen separations and fourteen re

"Whew! But you've had a busy
year," Remarked Judge Cabaniss, be

assault, on complaint of the woman.

"Then, I suppose, . those deep
scratches on George's face and neck
were self-Infiicted?"
"I don't know how he got 'em," was
the snapping rejoinder.
But the husband told a different
story. The unsightly furrows on his
face and neck were made by Lucille's
fingernails, he said, and he convinced
the court that he told the truth.
"Well," the wife exclaimed, "I have
marks, too, but I can't show them as
he does."
"You are still young," said the Judge,
addressing the couple, "and I'd ad
vise you to make your present separa
tion permanent. Fifteen rumpuses In
one year has surely proved your union
a mutual misfit."
Then the case was dismissed.
Dentist F. E. Strong. of 235 Kearny
street proved possession of a nasty
temper" by bridling up and declaring In
open court that he was, more sorry
than gratified he did not shoot Conduc
tor Andrew Brady on a McAlliBter
street car last Sunday evening. Judge
Mogan, to whom the declaration was
addressed, sternly reproved Dr. Strong
and found him guilty of disturbing the
peace and displaying a deadly weapon
In a menacing manner on the occasion
referred to. Mrs. Strong, who was with
her husband on the car, was found
guilty of disturbing the peace, and
Miss Anne Bollne, who was under their
escort, will ascertain to-day whether
she is to be convicted of peace disturb
ance or dismissed with a reprimand.
The doctor and the two women had
dined at a Mason-street restaurant be
fore they started out with the inten
tion of spending the remainder of Sun
day evening at the Chutes. They
boarded a Halght-street car, and after
ascertaining that the vehicle would not
convey them to their desired destina
tion the doctor procured transfers. The
trio got aboard the dummy of a Mc-
Allister-street car, and when the, con
ductor, Andrew Brady, informed the
doctor that the transfers j were not
good for that line the man of science
became abusive. The conductor was
firm, however, and to prevent expul
sion from the car one of the women
paid cash fare for the three. But still
the doctor raged, and finally his qon
duct became so offensive that the con
ductor stopped the car and ordered him
to get off. It was then the doctor drew
his pistol. He flourished the weapon
in such a reckless way that the other
passengers stampeded and stayed at a
safe distance until the police were sum
moned.
Mrs. Strong .abused the conductor
and tho policemen who arrested her
husband, and she, too,, was taken in.
The tongue of Miss Bollne, who had sat
upon the elder woman's lap during the
controversy, also contributed to the
peace disturbance. Judge Mogan would
probably have dismissed the case
against the young woman if she had
not trifled with truth in effort to aid
the other defendants. Dr. and Mrs.
Strong will be sentenced to-day.

saucily informed Judge Mogan that
she preferred the primrose paths of

father or mother had driven her to
the slums, Violet i said, nor had she

The Judge eyed the girl curiously

would be no punishment," .V he said,
"for your perverted mind cannot ap^
predate the degradation to which you
haVe voluntarily descended. Some
day you may^ realize how foolishly

a-tremble as she stepped aside.

"Neither. I am an Irishman."
"Well,. I might find some excuse for
your conduct if you were wedded to any
particular school of harmony," said
the court, "for I know what music
madness means. As it is, I must de

can now assure you that it will not
be tempered with mercy. You are a
hoodlum, and old enough to know
better." -
When the band In Golden Gate Park
last Sunday, had concluded playing the
great "Tannhauser Overture," and the
Wagnerites were wildly applauding,
there suddenly appeared among the
gratified musicians one Michael John
McCarthy, drunk and disorderly. He
accused the instrumentalists of being
"scabs," he pointed .derisively at the
chauffeurs in the multitude and de
clared they were "scabs," and finally
he informed the policemen who ar
rested him that they were "scab cops."
The adjectives employed by Mr. Mc-
Carthy to emphasize his denunciation
of scabbery were of a kind that caused
a hasty closing of feminine ears and a
doubling up of masculine fists.
"What did you do it for?" inquired
Judge; Mogan, before whom Mr. Mc-
Carthy was arraigned for disturbing
the peace.
"I went there with neaceable Inten
tions," was the ans/ver, "and was
peaceable until some one struck me."
"At . what music shrine â¢ are you a
worshiper â the Italian, or the Ger
man?" ,

general bond issue, but when the proposed
amount was added to the. $5.00u.000'<Â«for the
purchase of a water suppy and $2,000,000 for
r.'nferal city improvement!" the total was found
to be more than the . city couid Icrally be
banded for. and it was necessary to make the
echool bonds a separate issue. Better schools
are absolutely necessary . One school In
Oakland, the capacity of which is 600, is now
being used - to accommodate more than 1500
children. The city erovernment is taklngr all
possible precautions to make theaters and
public halls safe in case of fire, but just think
what the consequence would be If nre should

the addresses resolutions were passed
indorsing the bonds and the plans of
the Board of Education. Superintend
ent McClymonds told of the conditions
in some of the local schools, illustrating
the great need of Improvement. He
said in part:
Our sch<JoU are greatly, overcrowded and
many of the rooms in tbe district now occur
pled for school purposes are not suitable places
In which to house children. We have, rooms
in the basements of some of our building-*.
We have rented rooms not fitted for school
purposes, and wÂ« have constructed In a very
temporary manner many rooms to tide over
deflciencies. The Importance of this proposed
bond Issue is euch that all resident*' of the
district should be interested enough to go to
the [tolls and vote.

This identification clears up the
mystery that surrou-jded the flinlins <-f
s sloop floating bottom side Sp -it Point
Iliehn.ond on Sunday. April 19. In the
boat were a pair Â«>t shoos and a coat,
indicating that a :t:an had Ixtn
drowned. Nobody cpj^ured to claim
tbe boat, however, and the circum
stance might havÂ«j been forgotten,
along with the thousand other bay
mysteries, had not the body been found
last night.
The body was without coat or shoes,
and It was at once concluded that there
must be some connection between it
and the tragrtnly of the overturned boat.
This turned out to be correct when J-

The section that gave way is on the
Contra Costa County Fide on the old
stage road that led through Walnut
Creek to Concord. At one point a bad
slide occurred, which for a while
blocked the road to heavy travel. Su
pervisor Stow of Contra Costa Coun
ty, in whose district the tunnel road
lies, is now at work making repairs
and he announces that in about two
weeks he Avill have the road in good
condition. Even now the road is pass
able for ordinary vehicles, though not
If heavily laden.
Much store was set by this unique
road through the 'hills by the resi
dents of the San Ramon Valley, who
wanted quick and easy communication
with Oakland. The road was com
pleted last year and it was feared that
the winter rains might have a dam
aging effect upon thefiew work. Tha
new portion of the road from the foot
of the grade on the Oakland side to
the tunnel and then down to the
Buckley residence on the Contra Cos
ta side -withstood the winter. There
has been no time when this portion
was not oocn.
The famous- tunnel road between
Oakland and Walnut Creek is not in
such bad condition as early reports
indicated. The tunnel portion of the
road has always been in good condi
tion, though the spring storms caused
a bad slide between the Fish ranch
and the little settlement of Lafayette
on the Contra Costa side of the hills,
but even at this point the road can
be traveled. â¢

With much to commend and little to
criticize, Julian B. Harries, special ex
pert for the city employed by Mayor
Olney, filed a report to-day on the
condition of the books and financial
records in the various departments of
the municipal government. Account
ant Harries notes a number of changes
in method he thinks would improve the
bookkeeping and simplify the accounts.
The Auditor's work in closely collect
ing personal property faxes is favor
ably noted. Concerning the Tax Col
lector's office Harries says:
"The books and accounts of this de
partment are all that they should be,
creditably correct, but It Is more than
can be said of the records dating back
some years."
The cancellation, of $22,273, delinquent
personal property taxes, the bulk of
them having been Involved in dead
litigation with the Southern Pacific
Company, was urged.. The expert said
the amount was not collectable and
should no longer encumber the records.
New systems of bookkeeping Intro
duced into the Board of Public Works
by Secretary W. B, Fawcett are par
ticularly observed by the expert, who
adds:
"This Is a, great Improvement, . and
praise is due the clerk of the Board of
Works who. devised, the plan." . . \
Harries recommends an increase in
the deposit of ?lo demanded from con
tractors as a guarantee for the proper
renewal of streets and the cleaning up
of debris around new buildings after
work' shall have been completed;
A new method for. handling the as
sessment rolls is recommended. The
expert finds that there is a Ios3 to the
city in tax collections because of delay
in the furnishing of the rolls by the
County Assessor. He urges that a copy
of the county rolls be made simulta
neously with the progress of work in
the County Assessor's office.
in the manner of Issuing re
quisitions for supplies are recom
mended.

Mrs. Sidney Blanchard, the sister of
Miss Lillian Heald, who has been miss
ing for more than a week, is deter
mined to discover the identity of tha
mysterious "Mrs. Raymond" if that
person exists and has any regard for
the feelings of an anxious relative.
Miss Lillian Heald . dropped out of
sight Tuesday of last week and two
days later a letter was received by
Mrs.' Blanchard signed "Mrs."" William
Raymond." saying that the writer had
seen the missing girl fall into the bay
at .the foot of B street and drown.
The letter gave no address and was
believed by the police and Mrs.
Blancbard to have been the work of
the mislng girl herself. All efforts to
flnd Mrs. William -Raymond have been
unavailing and the mystery veiling the
letter is as deep as that surrounding
the missing girl. But more than a
week has passed and no trace of Miss
Heald has been discovered, and to-day
Mrs. Blanchard issued the following
letter addressed to the unknown Mrs.
Raymond in the hopes that she might
learn something either of the writer
or of the lost sister: .
Mrs. William Baymond: Whereas, your
Inter concerning my sister's disappearance ii
very unsatisfactory, and as in your excitement
you ware probably mistaken- as to tn* plaea
at which you eay this happened, and; wlÂ»n
I ' assure you that no blapne can rest on you
and there Js no ' way In which ttooble can
possibly come to you because of this matter. I
bee and pray that you will come to m* and
tell me JuÂ»t how it happened and where, for
I know it could not have been at B ntreÂ«t. as
there was no water there at the time you say
you saw her. '
If there is any reason why you cannot cent*
to me. you can write mÂ« again and correct any
mistake you may have made. If you had only
given your address I might have written or
gone to you. "â¢ -
If you have any human sympathy you win
do what I ask. * In horrible supeiwe.

past two days, came to a close short

existing between; Eastern and Western
agents concerning -the frequency,of de- ;
parture dates from^terminal; points Ion
the Pacific, CoasC It was the ,ex

that one day a week was sufficient ' to
handle the ; Pacific I Coast . traffic, 1 but
the coast agents held out for a greater
number of departure dates, : amounting
practically i tk/ two^ & week.* /After a
protracted discussion the Western men
succeeded; in the (Eastern

PASSENGER MEN AGREE .
ON RATES TO ST. LOUIS
None of the men are willing to com
promise, and the stablemen are equally
insistent that they may hire men;irre
spective of the fact whether or not they
belong to unions.
The question of an "open door" pol
icy is the bone of contention between
the drivers of unionized cabs and the
owners thereof, who constitute the Sta
blemen's Association. Last night there
was a consultation between representa
tives of the two organizations at- 24
Eighth street. The meeting was stormy
and practically without result.
The hackmen were insistent on an
abrogation of the notices posted in the
stables practically declaring that union
and non-union men were acceptable.
To this " the advocates of the drivers
objected so strongly that the meeting
was adjourned without a decisive de
termination. . X
At the end of^he session the repre
sentatives of the cabmen withdrew and
the owners remained. Before the break
up President Finn of the Stablemen's
Association delivered a ringing address
to the cabmen, telling them of .the ex
penses in the way of rent, feed "and
hire to which employerfl.are subjected.
The delegates , listened Â¦ '.coldly his
words and then withdrew to .their own
headquarters, where the question of an
"open door" policy was discussed nega
tively. â¢ â¢

BOSTON, April 20. â A' spirit of con
cession to the supporters of iW. R:
Hearst was manifest at to-night's
meeting of the Democratic . State
Committee, called to perfect arrange
ments for to-morrow's State conven
tion, at which delegates at large and
alternates to the National Convention
will be chosen. The friends of Rich
ard OIney claimed, however, that the
convention would advocate Olney's
nomination for the Presidency by se
lecting delegates pledged for him.
The Hearst men, headed by George
Fred Williams, won what they con
sider an important concession from
the State Committee when .that body
voted against the embodiment of the
unit rule in the call for the convent
tion. But, although they won this
point, there is nothing to prevent the,
OIney delegates presenting resolutions
to-morrow committing the convention
to the unit rule. Williams said to-f
night that if such resolutions were,
passed they would be illegal and any
attempt to bind' the district delegates
would be laughed at in St. Louis.
t The State Committee refused to al
low the protest of the Hearst support-;
ers that the caucuses in Lowell, which,
elected OIney delegates, were illegal,
but granted credentials to two Hearst
delegates in Chelsea, where OIney
delegates had been selected.

TORONTO, Ontario, April 20.â The
total loss by the fire which destroyed
the wholesale -district of Toronto last
night will, according to the most con
servative estimate,^ . reach \ $12,000,000,
The total insurance is ?8,360,Q00. The
area swept .by -the fire embraced four
teen acres, and / 10,000 persons are
thrown Qut of employment. The work
of tearing down the dangerous walls
was begun, this afternoon. In the
whole burned district the only walls
that appear to stand intact are those
of the W. R. Brock & Co. ; building.'
The City Council this afternoon placed
all public buildings and, the exhibition
grounds at the disposal of the fire suf
ferers; amended the fire regulations to
allow the erection of temporary, struc
tures and appointed a committee to
wait on the Legislature arid secure, ah
act ordering all wires underground.*'.
At a meeting of the Legislature the
Premier a'nd the leader of the opposl-"
tion expressed sympathy with the fire
sufferers and it was decided to place
a sum of. money In the supplementary
estimates for the benefit of the. fire
men's fund. â¢ It is probable that the
prorogation of the Legislature . fixed
for : Friday will be Indefinitely delayed
because of the fire., Th^'e burning of
the Warwick Bros. & Rutter building
delays the Government printing for
this year. . Â¦
The total number, of buildings de
stroyed is 122,' the number of firms
affected 222. It waÂ« decided- by the
City Architect to-n!ght to begin to
morrow morning the, work of dyna
miting all the standing walls in the
ruined district. M 'The smoldering
ruins broke out into* fiames- of con
siderable size during/ the /'afternoon

Dr. Brackett appeared at the Mayor's
office yesterday afternoon to present
hla defense, but the Mayor was not in,
Brackett confided to Secretary George.
Keane that he had a_ complete written
vindication from Mrs. Ames and he
promised to return later when the May
or would be in.
Unless Dr.. George, F. Brackett, chief
surgeon of the emergency hospitals, is
able to clear* himself of the charges
that he. had "demanded fees for work
performed in \ his? official ; capacity he
will be- removed from his position by
the Health Board.;
This statement was made yesterday
by "Mayor Schmitz, who further inti
mated that even if Brackett is able
to clear, himself- he w}ll , be given an
opportunity to resign. This course will
be taken for the betterment of the ser
vice, .as -the Mayor is -tiring of the
charges made against some of the at
taches Qf the Emergency Hospital staff.
These charges are likely to bring his
administration into disfavor.
; The charges against Brackett were
made by Mrs. Fannie Ames of 612 Stan
yan street, : who accuses Brackett of
trying to collect a fee from her for
work performed in his. official. capacity
in treating her husband, who was fa
tally injured in an "elevator accident.
M. Fleishhacker.-at whose place on Sut
ter, street Mr.i Ames was crushed, also
charged. Brackett with demanding and
receiving from him a fee of $5 and of
making an unsuccessful attempt subse
quently to collect an additional $100
from him (Fleishhacker).
PEKING, April 21.â The portrait of

year out, Â¦
from Willamette Valley points to San
Francisco. - .
Last fall the rate was raised to |5
pe^ton. The real reason for this is be
lieved to have been a scarcity of cars
and consequent inability to handle the
business offered from valley points, al
though it was semi-pfflclally stated that
competition by sea from Portland com
pelled the company to grant a lower
rate from this port.
Much activity w}ll mark the resump
tion of the old rate. In Lane County
alone the Booth-Kelly Company, which
a year ago v was employing 1000 men In
the running of four large mills, had cut
its product twQ'thirda. Thte company
announces that it will at once Increase
its output and put the old force at
work. Mills that are runping part time,
will be run full time, and other mills
will start .up as soon as logs can be
obtained. Logging crews have been or
dered to the woods at once.

Facts, an 8 to 1 chance, ridden by
McBride, captured the first event.. The
filly -had a chunk of weight off 'from
her previous race when she finished sec
ond to Harka, and was never headed.
Joe Jones took the place with Young
Favorites suffered severe reverses in
five out of six attempts, until Byroner
dale finally scored brackets. Facts,
Riesca- and Rio Shannon were the long
est priced winners. * ,
Joe Jones, who rode the .latter horse
in place of Fitzpatrick, seemed to know
how to handle, the Vivell entry better
than young Fitz. He had him in front
before the half mile pole was reached
and finished out with plenty In re
serve. There was no pace to speak of,
for Lewis had Horton right up on the
firing line all the time, disposing of
Criss Cross by nearly. a length for the
place. Gateway, the favorite, could
probably have won with a more-ex
perienced rider ; up, Sherwood showing
to poor advantage. , "
FIVE FAVORITES BEATEN.
Horton looked out of place In the
mile handicap at Oakland yesterday
with the colors of Charley McCafferty

RIO SIfAXXOX SCORES]
Old Rio Shannon surprised everybody
by capturing the mile and a quarter
selling affair at odds of 12 to 1. At the
first turn the outsider met with some
interference, but Knapp gave him no
time to loaf and, l&cklng horns with
Mr. Dingle in the stretch, led the latter
out with considerable to spare. Canejo,
the post favorite, which was also badly
bumped at the clubhouse turn, losing
much ground, ran a fair third. Idogo
quit after leading for nearly a mile.
According to common rumor Su
burban Queen had regained her best
Eastern form and the mare went to
the' post favorite over Oscar Tolle for
the fifth, a Futurity sprint. Jed Lewis
got her away sailing, but she tired
badly as the wire was approached and
Holbrook landed Oscar Tolle an easy
winner. Dr. Sherman, a 25 to' 1 shot,
disposed of Kylo II for third place.
Knapp rode his third winner in the
concluding mile selling run. "Big
Bill" piloted the( 7 to 5 favorite. Byron
erdale, and, keeping his mount in front
from start to finish, won: ridden, out
a length before Oro Viva. Golden
Light was third.*
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Morello. The Lieutenant, the mild 4
to 1 favorite, ran third. Algaretta, the
second choice, displayed a flash of early
speed, then ended ( up in last position.
Held at the short price of 2 â¢ to R,
Whoa Bill finished second to Riesca in
the five and a half furlong sprint fol
lowing. Willie See had the leg up on
the first choice and early during the
running made no effort to shake off his
company. In the stretch, when See
finally did make a move, Riesca, with
Knapp up, passed him on the outside,
winning at will. Dr. Roweil took the
show. Darksome, a hot tip, showed no
speed whatever.

The sun was'ready to' take a vacation
for the* day "and Recreation Park was
about to be wrapped in the shadows of
night when lo, Mr. "Truck" Egan
swung ' through , with a mighty two
base clout As Mr. Kruger gave chase
to the , sphere, Mr. Casey hied himself
to the home. plate. On arid on he came
till he finally landed. . It was the only
run of the game and; Mike Fisher was
safely intrenched at the top of the pro
cession. Score J Oakland 0; Tacoma 1.
When "Truck'' batted out. that f a-r
mous "drive of his two were out and it
was Tacoma's last chance with the bat.
Casey had singled out to center field
and Sheehani had sacrificed.- Nordyke
could not make good with a bingle, so
the responsibility rested with "Truck,"
and . he/ transformed himself from an
ordinary ball player into a hero.

DERBY ENTRIES
MADE PUBLIC
The bettors apparently think Jack
Johnson, the colored boxer, has the
Indian sign on Sam McVey. the twen
ty-year-old Oxnard Hercules. Johnson
has been made a 6 to 10 choice in the
betting: on their third engagement,
Yihich will take place to-morrow night
In Mechanics* Pavilion under the aus
pices of the recently organized Shasta
Club.
These boxer* met twice last year and
Bohnson gained the decision each time
on points. It has always been a case
cf a marvelous boxer against a man
with great strenrth and considerable
cleverness.
McVey was measured by Dr. Ttllman
yesterday. - He is most deceptive in
appearance, one's first impression being
that he is on the small order. The
tape shows him to be six feet in height
Â»nd all his measurements are in pro*
portion to this. They are:
Welcfct. SOS pounds: height, e {Â«et; neck, 18
Snchee; chest. 41 Inches normal, 44H Inches
â¢xpanded: reach. 77 inches; biceps, 16 inches;
forearm, IS Inches; wrist. T'i Inches; fist, 14*6
Inches; waist, 84 inches: hips, 41 ij inches :
thlrh. 25 inches; calf, JÂ«H Inches; ankle, 10
luchef.
With all his sise he is quick as a cat
tn his feet and moves about in a lithe,
Â¦jraceful way.
Both McVey and Johnson feel that if
either wins decisively to-morrow night
there is a chance of Jeffries wiping out
the color line and fighting the success
ful man. "With this as an Incentive
the colored giants are expected to put
up a fast pace.

keeper at, 21 IS Pacific' "a'Venue._ .~Z
Mrs. Cra'bb's Â«sfate, which was

not been for the Harleys' preventing
their aunt from seeing them or meet

would have been reversed and that
they and not' the Harleys would have
been the principal legatees.

WI1JL. OF JANET CRABB
SUBJECT OF CONTEST
Captain Kinder, the Mongolia's com
mander, whose . long record of service
with the "White Star line marks him a
navigator of skill, is not blamed for the
misfortune which befell his giant
charge. The bar on which the Mongolia
struck is said to have been uncharted.
It was situated, according to the ship's
log, ten miles from shore. Officers and
men on Tuesday said the vessel strand
ed at Pernambuco and was ashore for
two hours. The official record of the
accident, however, gives the ten-mile
off-shore location and places the Mon
golia's time of detention on the shoal
at twenty minutes.
In addition to such repairs as may
be necessary, the Mongolia is far from
being finished, and there are many
hours* work for many mechanics before
the Pacific Mail Company's latest ad
dition is ready for service.
The steamship was towed to the dry
Â¦dock by the tugs Sea King, Sea Prince
and Redmond. Darkness fell before the
water was all pumped from the big
basin, and with six feet of the Mongo
lia still submerged the pumps were
stopped until this morning. The twist
ed blade was clear of water, but it was
too dark to make a satisfactory exam
ination even of that.
* The' Mongolia was placed on the dry
dock yesterday for the purpose of hav
ing her bottom cleared of the marine
growths accumulated during her long
voyage and to have surveyed and re
paired the damage sustained when she
bit tbe South American sandbar.
The Pacific Mail Company's big liner
Mongolia, which arrived Tuesday, from
Norfolk, Va., made her way fromthe
vicinity of Pernambuco with a blade or
one of her propellers twisted nearly two
feet out of its true position. Thls*much
was revealed yesterday when the ves
sel was placed on Hunters Point dry
dock. How much more damage she sus
tained when she ran ashore off the Bra
zilian coast will not be known until this
morning:, when the pumping out of the
water in the dock will be completed
and a thorough investigation made pos
sible. i% . â¢

BUDGET ESTIMATE.â The Board of Publio
Works did not issue its estimates of expendi
tures for the next municipal budget yesterday,
as anticipated. The figures were submitted to
Mayor Schmitz. who desired to make some
changes before submitting It to the Board of
Supervisors.
Considerable* contention arose con
cerning the ferry news stand, and tes
tlnflfcjiy given In Judge Seawell's court
last g March showed that President
Spear of the Harbor Commissioners
was anxious that James F. Rooney, his
brother-in-law, be given the privilege,
despite the fact that he was overbid
by Foster & Orear.
The decision rc-dered by Seawell was
that Rooney be permanently barred
from the right of leasing the news
stand, and that the present tenants
be allowed to remain until some other
bidder went. higher than they.
The stand has doubtless been a mint.
The rent for the last seven years has
been only J430 per month. ....-Â¦:'Â¦ .
The bid was accompanied by a certi
fied check on the Crocker- Woolworth
Bank. It was decided yesterday that
Foster & Orear be allowed to remain
in possession. V ..
At the meeting of the Harbor Com
missioners yesterday one t)ld was , re
ceived for the privilege of the news
stand at the ferry building. Foster
& Orear, the present tenants, were the
only bidders. Foster & Orear's bid is
$1565 a month, of about $1100 a month
more than they were paying a month
ago. . , . 1

Kennedy became so interested in
"Jimmy" Michael in the heyday of that
cycle champion's popularity that he be
came his manager and gave Michael the
best "artillery" of pacing machines
possessed by any rider on the circuit.
Kennedy was interested in the promo
tion of prize fights both in the East and
the. West at different times, being
financially interested in boxing and
athletic promoting clubs in New York
and in San Francisco. He was reputed
to be largely interested in the Yosemite

summoned from the Cumberland Street

nounced Kennedy dead. The body was
identified by Matthew McGrath, his

WASHINGTON. April 20.â The Sena
tor Perkins amendment to the naval
appropriation bill providing for \ the
building of. one of- two colliers in a
navy yard on the Pacific Coast was
finally adopted to-day. This provision
that one of the two colliers be built in
a navy yard was originally proposed
by Bell of California in the House two
months ago. When the bill got to the
Senate Perkins amended it providing
that both colliers be built in navy
yards, one on each coast, thus insuring
one to Mare Island if the amendment
carried. The House refused to accept
the amendment. The Senator insisted
and his conferees reported a disagree
ment. In the House to-day Bell made
a strong plea for the Senate amend
ment and it was carried by a large
majority. ,
The building of the collier will mean
an expenditure of $1,250,000 at Mare
Island and it is thought to be the fore
runner of a policy to build warships in
navy yards.
The House to-day, after an extended
debate, sent the naval appropriation
bill back to conference, r the only dis
puted Senate amendment accepted be
ing that providing for the construction
in navy yards of the two colliers.

'Â¦ NEW YORK. April 20.â The volume of deal
ings in stocks dropped off again to-day and
the price movement brcame very uncertain and
j slusglhh. These characteristics gained in force
as the plan of the market got away from last
night's level, either above or below, until the
movunrat came to a rtandstill and then turned
ff-cbly in the other direction. The action of
tiae market thus plalniy indicated the opera
tions of room traders of a vmall class and of
I timid convictions. The. new direction to be
taken by the contest for Control of Northern
I Pecinc i? the subject most largely discussed
j by speculators, and the opinion is quite unl-
I versal ifcct this overhanging Influence Is the
caure of the stagnation in the market. This
ftÂ»-llng fin-is ainil gallon in London aÂ£ well as
here. On. the occasional upturns of the course
of prices / to-day, however, it was quite no
ticeable that the Pacifies were Inclined to take
the lead of the movements The report of
rain In the western portion of the winter wheat
belt may have had some influence upon thu
group. But those stocks yielded again. The
further drprerslon in United States Steel pre
ferred had an undoubted sympathetic effect
on the whole market, the more Â«o as its source
and motive were not clearly understood. The
market closed dull and weak. Â«

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Arrivals of Butter, were again large and the
market continued more or less weak, though
there was no actual decline. Stocks on the
floors were about the sam* size as they have
been for a fortnight or more. Some houses
were letting their fine creameries go at ISc.
but as a rule 10c was obtained. The demand
Is nothing extra at present.
Cheese continues weak and - stocks are still
excessive. â¢
Eggs rule steady and for the general run of
trade quotations remain unchanged. But the
market hus worked around Into the condition
where It gtts bometlines, when sales above th?
quctatlons are belnz made, but hardly enough
to justify a flat advance In print. Every, dealer
now has some extra flnc largo white ranch
Eggs for which he can get 20c, while for every
Case he sells for 20c he sells ten for 19c. That
! Is. the market Is neither one thing nor the
other. At the same time It will, be seen that ;
the receipts are running large, and If. storing !
were lo ceasq the market would probably drop |
two or three cents. The large handlers, who
are conservative, arc not disposed to advance :
their prices, while the outsiders,' such as th? |
poultry, fruit and vegetable houses, who" re
celv* comparatively few. arc getting all they i
can and are quoting 20c. Thin margin of lc I
around town unsettles the conditions ami ren
ders flat quotations rather difficult to give. It Â¦
will bear repeating that almost half of the cur- ',
rent receipts are going Into. store for lack of j
custom. A day or two will probably readjust 1
conditions once more to a -uniform' basis. ; .]
Receipts were 77,200 lbs , Butter, 1<Â«4 cases

STATE OF BUSINESS.
Hozti the Country Looks From
Headquarters.
The New York circular of Henry Clews thuÂ«
state* the current condition of trade:
"The developments which serve to check un
due enthus'.asr.i on the bull clde of the marl;et
are thÂ« poor Oovernnu-nt reiiort on winter
Â¦wheat, the less satirfactory reports of railroad
â¢ . â¢-:!.. :.kÂ». the large decline in March Â« xport*.
the decline in Clearing -house rtturr-s and the
Tall of nearly $S.OÂ«O.OCO in surplus reserves.
Some of these influences receive more atten
tion than they deserve: some do not. It Is
altogether too early to form any opinion about
t!:e wheat crop, which now is probably in
better condition than at the time of the Gov
ernment statemrr.t. Yet that had a decidedly
discouraging effect upon speculation, and Crom
now on the crops will be a factor of increasing
importance in the market. As to railroad earn
ings, come disappointment must be cor.feswd.
for after the losses rrom severe weather :n
January ar.d February it was hoped March
would show a general improvenv nt. which

It may be mentioned, showed a reduction of
12 per cent compared with last yar, the whole

Kew England State*, the Western. Houthrm
attd Pacifle Coart States continuing to report

tmde. The larger ehare of thii> could lie
tracÂ«4 to labor agitation and Iron trade re
action, while the effect of the war In Asia
and the Presidential election here somewhat
chÂ«cka enterprise.
TlIK EXPORT TRADE.
'â¢The most unsatisfactory feature In the pres
ent situation lÂ« our loss of export trade. In
March there Â«-aÂ« a reduction of about $23.
000.000 in exports compar<-d with a year ago,
mnn than one-half of which was in cotton
ftid the remainder In wheat. Scarcity and cx
osrslve. speculation In these staple*, especially
in rotton. werr chiefly r*>Fj.onFible for this un
meloome change In the drift of our foreign
trade. At the same time imports of tnerchan
<JIÂ»Â»Â» showed a !oss of over $5,000,000. which
â¢somewhat corroborates the r'-port* of lessened
trade activity. If three tmdencirii continue
they are likely to Ftlroulate sold exports to a
Â¦ greater degree than anticipated. In fact, the
conditions ere more In favor Of gold ship
ments than for several jvurs pant at this sea
son. Easy money, larger surplus reserve* than
for some years and the pronp'-ctn of Kurope
Â¦Hling American Btocks In case of a Russian
or Japanese loan all work in favrr of gold

ports. However, this ne*d cause no concern,
for Â«'f usually ship gold freely at this t^a^on.
and the country now holds over $1.30<\(iOO.O<X>
gold money, which Is almost double that held
only seven years ago. It Is plain we car
â¢pare gold freely without any anxiety.
"A feature In the money market is the con
tinued heavy corporation borrowing, explained
by thf fact that tbese concerns need money for
enlargementa. etc., and find this means of
obtaining funfl* better than an Isfuc of securi

An excellent illustration of this golden stream,
is before us now. The steamer Gaelic came

much of that gold going out of New York to
Europe came Into Ban FrÂ«Lnclsoo from Japan

The Hay circular of Somers & Co. says:
"Shipments "of Hay show some diminution
again, the total for .' the week just ended
amounting ' to â¢ 2700 s tons, in comparison ' with
3300 tons for the week preceding. This lessen
ing In shipments has not helped the situation
as yet, for. there ' is still an accumulatiop of
Hay on the 'tracks- here resulting from the
oversupply- of last week. It is quite evident
that outside shippers received rather disap
pointing figures -for much: of their Hay, which
has resulted in their discontinuing shipping to
a very great extent, probably with the idea
of seeking other markets for thetr surplus. At
present the market is very much depressed,
with most elements at work to lower prices
still further. We are 'inclined to believe, how
ever, that the worst Is now over and that the
situation will continue along fairly strong until
the new crop begins to arrive in quantities. ! It
was â¢ reportPd : several days ago- that volunteer
Hay-wes being cut In Contra Costa County.
The recent showers will probably spoil most of
this, or at. least keep It from the market for
some time to come. The 20th of. May is about
the average date for the first appearance of
new grain Hay here, although when the weath
er remains dry it often makes Its appearance
much earlier. In many districts Â¦ the growth
Is yet rather short, but now that we have
had further showers, there .will probably be a
groat Improvement Tin this dlrectfon and tho
harvesting of some will be considerably dÂ«
layed." . " ;â¢ . . Â¦

"Yes, but I still believed that Hyde's
title's were in the main all right. The
only real defect I- feared was as to the
existence of. some of his original grant
ors, but he was- getting affidavits from
a number \ of j these j and -.1 ( took this a a
evidence, that all of. them were existing
persons. . Yes, I believed his statement
that ; Elizabeth 'Dimond was - in exist
ence." , <- : - : :
you tell; Steece what Hyde had
admitted to you -In- his letter of January
10. regarding the titles he: had obtained
by the 'use 'of bootblacks, barbers and
others at a- small consideration?"
"No. â¢ I thought that Hyde had per
haps-come pretty close to the; line in
his operations with' the bootblacks and
the friends Â¦ of the . negro Janitor, but' I
thought that as these people had been
used -to obtain California school lands
the fraud, If fraud there was, was upon
the State and not upon the Federal
Government. No, I did not feel that
my having 'been | his attorney obllgetl
me to proclaim his acts to the Govern
ment agent."'- '. . . . .
HENEY PRESSES DDIOXD.
"Did you not" feel that your oath as
an ; attorney -bound you to expose him,
especially in- view of the fact that you
believed that he. had. come pretty close
to the Â¦ line and possibly had his large
toe over 'the line?" asked Heney with
a 'straight face.' ' - . ;
"No,;r had. made up my mind before
leaving Washington " to . . discontinue
business for 'him, but still -I, had no
knowledge of any guilt j on his ] part."
' -'Did. you not know that, he had used
dummies, in .obtaining his school jands
and that these" bootblacks . arid "others
whomhe bought in; droves had perjured
themselves in swearing to .descriptions
of lands they had never seen?" '
'.'Noi T did not look 'at the" matter in
that way." ". * ' Â¦ ; Â¦â¢'â¢'Â¦ Â¦ â¢â¢ .,
"Did not you. and* Mr. ? Browne, of
Britton S & : Gray, agree that" Hyde was
crooked?" 1 . ; . ' * . .<-'
" "Well, 'Â¦Â¦ Browne : said that'sHyde . was
a-; fool. He^.read; HydeV letter to" me
dated. January .*. 16, -1903. j and * then 'he
advised me to write s a" mighty, strong
letterâ to : take '; the*, gloves . right off.
Browne said all the .selectors' who had
bought' .the t Hyde-Benson . base . glands
would be making trouble f or â¢ Hyde If
the suspension ordered ' was not re
voked. So I -.wrote Hyde my letter of
January 22,' telling. .him that it was â¢ no
longer; a question of preventing the
cancellation, of the selections, but of
heading .'off. a ; criminal, prosecution." â¢
â¢ "You knew then that he was liable to
prosecution?" ' â¢ - â¢ ~~
"Yes, -but only for, using . fictitious
names, so far as I was aware. I knew
nothing, of. dummies or- forged affi
davits."
â¢ "As you 'had . appeared as . attorney
in the Elizabeth' Dimond selections, did
it not bccur.that you, ' too, were liable
to prosecution?"- . :*.:

again over-, the details of. the Hyde-
Dimond. correspondence and of Di
mond's knowledge^., of Hyde's; office
methods.. The Government
clafm" they, have made out. a. clear case
against â¢. Dimond * as well" as against
Hyde. ; on the ground that the former
had r knowledge that should have -put
him on hist guard ' and 1 that ' his c failure

Catherine J. Flynn a short time ago;
is seeking a divorce on the ground of
cruelty. He says she hurt his feelings

DODGES ALIMONY.
Mrs. Childs finally became composed
and was led from the court by her
friends. She will to-day complete her
tale of matrimonial unhappiness.
Mrs. Childs is the plaintiff in; a
divorce action. It is a contested pro
ceeding, Childs having filed an answer
to her suit denying her charges and in
a cross-complaint filed counter charges.
They- were married' in New York ,ln
1901. Mrs. Childs at the time being a
widow, with one child, Madeleine, then
twelve , years of age. They took- up
their residence at Redding, where
Childs was superintendent of the Bully
Choop group "of mines. They did not
live long together, Mrs. Childs, she al
leges in her complaint, having learned
of certain facts connected with her hus
band that caused her to look upon him
with loathing and compelled her to
leave him. She told her tale of misery
to the court yesterday and it was while
under cross-examination that she
broke down and made' the attempted
assault upon her spouse.
"Judge, I did not. mean to, lose con
trol of myself, but the sight of that
man, sitting there, where every time I
raised my eyes they fell upon his
loathsome face was too much for. me.
I hate him and I have every reason for
doing so." ;Â¦
LED FROM COURT.
"Let me go! let me go !"_ she cried
again and again as she was seized by
her attorney and the court attaches
and several of her friends. That man
has ruined my- life. Oh. he is low!
Please let me go."
Childs rose nervously from his seat
and stepped beyond the vision of his
wife's eyes. She attempted to follow
him, but was restrained, and it was
only when he left the courtroom that
she quieted down. Turning to Judge
Hebbafd. who, when she first lost con
trol of herself, had declared the court
adjourned, she elapsed her hands ap
pealingly and in a voice that was tense
with emotion said:
Quivering and shaking, in every limb,
with fire darting from her gray eyes;
Edith Childs stood on the witness
stand in Judge Hebbard's court yester
day and denounced her husband. .Je
rome S. Childs, superintendent of-*he
Bully Choop mines of Shasta County,
who, with downcast head and flushed
face, sat a few feet away. She called
him a beast and a brute, and then with
a stamp of her foot and a wild cry
made a rush toward him.

"Do you not know that Mr. Wheeler
is now acting on behalf of Mr. Hyde in
this proceeding?" ' -
j "I can answer that question," cried
Wheeler, springing to his feet. "The

. Â¦ "The Government is entitled to
know whether this witness is co-oper

"Not in any way," chorused the at
torneys for Dimond and ;Hyde.
.-Wheeler added: "If the Government

two defendants, well and good. \ As a
fact, however, there is rro such connec
tion." â¢ ' .

"You remember thatÂ» I sent you an
offer to accept any: statement y you
might; make; to ,me; and- promised, if
you could clear up certain matters, to
move that the complaint "as against
you be dismissed ?'.' ; was. Heney's next
query. â¢ â¢ , ; / . ' â¢
â¢ "Yes,"/ answered Dimond ;â¢ "ray son

call, at your; office and to .bring; a

"When Hyde-talked with you in the
spring: of 1901 about going to Washing-,
.ton in his interest what did he say con
corning the repeal of the forest reserve
act of 1897?" was Henfey's first ques
tion. It opened the way to a mass of
testimony in part as' follows : ' j-'i. '
Hyde raid it was likely the act wouid .be
regaled, as muny attcinuls to ; tinker. It
already occurred, and Land Commissioner Her
mann was believed to be trylmt to get â¢ Â«tj*
peaUd altogether. Hyde told me to keep track
of these, movements against the Â¦ Â»ct .e-^ -TV hen
he fame to Washineton in October. 1001- he
asked me to orolon* my stay there . In order
to kfeD track of oofsible legislation, and he
then esalainÂ«d"that he was indifferent to the
proposed repeal, provided former relinquish
ments were protected. In December I advised
him that tome bills on the subject had been
introduced In Congress. Lnder date December
23. 1901. he replied, saylne amone other
things- "Better devote yourself to protecting
the existlns surrenders. There should be no
trouble in getting such a proviso inserted in
the new act. J might spend a lot of money
In tryinc to prevent the repeal of the P" 8^"'

any money in a general scramble, with curb
stone brokers, because I cannot work f or _a o
per cent commission. I profited only where
1 had a monopoly of brains or opportunity. ,
"What did Hyde mean," asked
Heney. "when he said he' had been
scrambling with curbstone brokers ?"
HEXEY HINTS AT COLLUSION.
This started a lively , altercation
aniong the attorneys, in which tHe
question was lost . ; sight of . â¢ Wheeler
protested that Hyde's sentence could
not be so interpreted, arid -McEnerney
jocularly offered to referee the' "scrap"
between Hyde's attorney and Govern
ment counsel. Heney. finally-masked
the witness: . â¢ - â¢
THE ACT OF 1897
Yesterday "was an uncomfortable day
for Henry P. Dimond under cross-ex
amination by Francis J. Heney, spe
cial counsel for the Government. in the
land -frauds case. The witness was
pressed as to his knowledge ofj the' al
leged Illegal acts of his ; former client
and present codefendant, Fred A. Hyde.
He admitted â¢ that his Â¦ dissatisfaction
with Hyde's acts and statements had
led him to cease to act as the land
speculator's attorney and that he had
failed thereafter to disclose his knowl
edge to the Government agent who
questioned him regarding Hyde's meth
ods," but he stoutly"protested that noth
ing, he had ever ; known or done or
failed to do made him in any way a
party to the conspiracy to defraud the
Government, as charged in the Federal
Grand Jury's indictment.
The day's work brought out more
fully the story of the rupture between
Hyde and Dimond when the latter re
turned from, Washington last year dis
gusted with-his client's refusal to fol
low his recommendations.- Incidentally
the witness charged Hyde and Benson
with having treated him most Illiber
ally in the matter of payment for his
professional services, in the deal nego
tiated by him with the Seligmahs in
New Tork for the purchase of the Aztec
Cattle Company's vast holdings in Art t
zona. This testimony gave weight to
Dimond's denial that he and Hyde are
now co-operating in their defenseâ a
denial emphatically indorsed by all the
attorneys for the two defendants con
cerned In the current proceedings be
fore United States Commissioner E. H.
Heacock.
More .of the â¢ Hyde-Dimond letters
were introduced in evidence, and Heney
obtained from the Commissioner a rul
ing admitting as to bot* the defend
ants that portion of the correspondence
which' was put in by Wheeler during
his direct â¢ examination of his client.
This decision was made against the
strenuous objection of Garret W. Mc-
Enerney, Hyde's attorney.
"We now offer .the Hyde-Dimond let
ters that werevput in evidence by Di
mond," said'Heney, "and we offer them
as to both Dlmond and â¢ Hyde." .<
"The letters are privileged'communi
cations," objected McEnerney, but the
Commissioner' overruled .'the objection,
and the letters evidence against
both defendants. Heney, however,
turned first; to Dimond's interview with
the Government's agent, H.. E. Steece,
before taking the 'witness back to his
correspondence- with Hyde. Steece 'had
come to San Francisco in company with
Jude A. B. Pugh of the. Interior De
partment-in; February, 1903,- to; investi
gate the land frauda.The witness said
that Dimond had first told him of their
being here and asked that he see them
and try to Impress upon them that. the'
Hyde-Benson ,, land transactions ', were:
legal. Steece 'had . called by. invitation
and Dimond . had assured . him that
Hyde had an excellent; standing in the
community and'numbered many.promi
nent people among his friends.
"You knew then that Pugh and
Steece were investigating Hyde's
Dlmond'alst) told of a series of trips
he had made to Marin, Contra Costa
and Alameda; counties in the interests
of the Automobile Club's effort to have
the Supervisors . enact ' satisfactory
speed ordinances. He. had -. obtained
this employment 'Â¦ through Â¦ Hyde, who
was president of the club, but- when
the club paid his fee of $100 Hyde kept
the check, saying the work had been
part of Dfmond's employment by him.
"! thought this. a small piece of . busi
ness on his part,'' added the witness.
INTERVIEW WITH; STEECE.
Benson was in New York at the time,' but
when he . returned ; I saw him about^Hyde's
statement that he (Benson) ; would ' not con
sent to pay anything to me for the Aztec land
contract. - Benson said it wul'a d d'lie."
He, too, admitted- that I was entitled to com
pensation, but he said he was in trouble hav
ing been indicted for bribery, and had to raise
so much money, that It would be. almost im
possible for him to pay me anything until the
legal proceedings were out of the way.
Hyde put up a poor mouth. ''He said he had
b^en done out ; of hi* share of the Droflts by
Benson, and he received .only $10,000 and some
of .'the land still remaining unsold,' instead of
the $30. COO he oueht to have had. I was en
titled to pay for my- service, he admitted, but
he said he could not pay me ajiythingr without
Benson's consent and Benson would not afree.
&I Bot pretty angry while listening- to Hyde,
and told Â¦ him ; It was a dâ â d' shame that a
man should do so much work and; not, b? paid
for it. I-also informed him that -I. recognized
some cberacteristicfi of which â¢ others had told
me, namely, "thaf he was a .'cold. -hard and
grinding man. . Perhaps si interoolated some
language even stroncer than* this. 'Â¦-/Â¦-.-.'-
divided $60,000 profit. Acting on . the Â¦ advlc*
of : Sena tor 'Felton, I sent for'Hyd? . and-he
came to my office, where I reminded 'him that
I was â¢till unoaid for my- work.^and said I
believed r was entitled 1 to a fee of^lO per'cent
on the profits growing out -of 'their' sale of the
landa. This: had been a -matter wholly out
side my retainer from him in the lieu land
business, >I added.; and Â¦ I ihad : successfully
