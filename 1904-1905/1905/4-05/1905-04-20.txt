OMAHA. April 19â have enjoyed
the novelty of working for my daily
bread very much, indeed. I consider
It to be of the utmost importance for
every young man to know how to
â work, whether he is compelled to or
not.
With these words young Herbert N.
Harriman, cousin of the great railroad
magnate and sen of the late Oliver
Harriman of New York, bade good-by
to-day to his attempt to learn practi
cal railroading:. This evening he left
Omaha for his home In Westbury,
lÂ»ong Island. . -;* ;
That his success has not been great
er is in no sense due to his lack of de
termination. A millionaire probably
twice over in his own right, young
Harriman gave up the pleasures of
v New York society to come to Omaha
and take a position as clerk in the
, general auditing offices of the Union
Pacific. For nearly five months he has
held down the job, performing^ faith
fully the duties of _ his. self-imposed
tjfek v . f : : , : ':V' ' : '\-'-'^^- â ' *-,-'-â¢
Kls superiors say he Hm& been too
long accustomed' to look upon life as
one continual round of pleasure to be
able to learn to become a railroad
man. To add a simple column of fig
ures seemed -utterly beyond his ca
pacity. igtfj*
"It was -pretty hard lines for a young
man -who had never in his life applied
himself to business in a business-like
way," said young Harriman to-day,
'"to gt> to work like an ordinary clerk,
with absolutely no more privileges
than any other clerk in the office. But
1 felt at the same time that I was
learning something of a practical busi
ness life. I came to Omaha with a
purpose, and, having accomplished
that purpose, I am now going home
to engage in Eome business. I have
â¢ not yet fully determined just what line
of business I shall take up; but it
probably will be something in the rail
road, as I own a great deal of railroad
stock of one kind and another."
One part of Harriman's programme
â was abandoned long ago. When he
came to Omaha he declared his Inten
tion of living: within his salary- A
Junior clerk in the auditing office is
paid $12 a week, but Harriman found
this entirely inadequate to meet the
necessities of existence and frequent
drafts were made upon his private re
sources.
Since coming to Omaha the report
of the New York State tax appraiser
has been made, showing the estate of
Oliver Harriman, who died more than
a year ago at Mount Klsoo, N. V.. to
be worth 54,216,301. which was divided
among eight children, of whom Her
bert was the youngest.

to Resign.
Foang Millionaire Says It Is a Piete
of Impertinence and That He
Will Disregard It.
NSW ORLEANS. April 19.â Edgar If.
Cahn, an attorney, filed suit in the
civil courts here to-day on behalf of
] himself and other policy holders of j
the Equitable Life Assurance Society
of the United States, asking for a re
ceivership under the laws of Louisiana
and for an accounting of the company's
affairs, in view of the New York situa
tion.
NEW YORK, April 19.â After a pro
tracted session behind closed doors,
the 200 or more general agents of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society
adopted a resolution to-day calling on
Vice President J. H. Hyde to resign
from his position with the organiza
tion, and appointed a committee of five
from their number to call on Hyde and
present the demands.
Late to-night the announcement was
j made that the agents' committee ap
pointed to wait on Hyde and present
the resolutions asking his resignation
| had arranged to meet him to-morrow
! morning at his home at 9 o'clock. Hyde
attended the theater to-night and the
agents held no further conferences.
"jr.VSULTIXG. " SAYS HYDE.
Hyde was first notified that the com
mittee would wait on him at 4 o'clock.
He waited in company with his coun
sel. At 6:30 o'clock the committee had
not appeared and Hyde left the office.
He said: "I have not seen the com
mittee and 1 have not seen the resolu
tions, but I consider them impertinent,
extraordinary, insulting and most pre
posterous. I have no intention of re
signing."
One of the most Interesting: develop
ments of the late session to-day was
the adoption of the following resolu
tion: "*â¢Â»'
"Whereas, it has been perslstenly
suggested in the public press that the
agents are for mutualization because
they seek to acquire full or partial con
trol of the society by acquiring proxies;
therefore be it
"Resolved, That we, the general
agents of the society, in convention as
sembled, do hereby declare that we do
not ask nor will we seek for ourselves
for any part of the control of the
Equitable, but demand that through
the policy-holders this shall be co vest
ed as best to conserve their interests,
without the confidence of whom we
cannot exist in this business."
AGEMTB IX ORGANIZATION.
At the later session a permanent or
ganization was formed and a commit
tee named to go to Albany on Friday
to petition the Insurance Commission
ers and Governor Higgins to urge the
mutualization of the society. Among
those on the committee are: A. M.
Shields, San Francisco; F. B. Wilcox,
Boise City, Idaho; Wyman Ellis,
Helena, Mont; L. Samuel. Portland,
and O. F. Kutenewsky, Salt Lake.
After the appointment of this com
mittee it was decided that it would be
advisable to form a permanent organi
zation, and the committee on permanent
organization of the "National Associa
tion of Managers" was named. C. M.
Edwards is chairman.
A committee was named to bring
President Alexander and Second Vice
President Tarbell before the committee i
to thank them for the hospitality re
ceived at their hands. Alexander said
he could not express hh great pleasure
and love for the agents who had so
magnificently -upheld his action and
had expressed their confidence In him.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 19.â New York
and Pittsburg society was astonished
to-day over the publication of a story
to the effect that Miss Nancy Carnegie
returned from Europe on Sunday last
with her smother's former coachman
and riding master, to whom she had
been secretely married "about a year
ago.' The exact date of the wedding
is withheld by the Carnegie family,
though the marriage is admitted. The
couple brought an infant daughter back '
j with them.
The story was first printed in a Pitts
i burg paper early this morninj? and was
denounced as a scandalous fabrication
| by those of Miss Carnegie's friends who
were unaware of her marriage: but.
when Andrew Carnegie was seen by
reporters at his palatial home in Fifth
: avenue, New York, he admitted the
, facts and professed great satisfaction
; that his= niece had married a sober, mi
i dustrious man rather than a "worth
less Duke."
"It is ridiculous," Carnegie said, "to
bring this affair up. My niece and Mr.
Hever were married in New York City
a year ago. It is true the weddlne was
a quiet affair. We want no rich men
in the Carnegie family. Mr. Hever
was a riding master at Newport and it
was there, while he was teachimr her
to ride, my niece fell in love with him.
Mr. Hever was at one time, I believe,
in the employ of Lordâ Lord some one
or another, in Englandâ for the life of
me, I can't remember his name."
"Do you happen to remember Mr.
Hever's Christian name?" the steel
king was asked.
â¢ Mr. Carnegie thought a moment.
"No, 1 can't remember that just now
either," he said.
"What business does Mr. Hever ex
pect to engage in, Mr. Carnegie? Will
he continue to act as riding master?"
was the auery.
"How should I know?" exclaimed
Carnegie. "Don't ask me such foolish
questions."
As Miss Nancy Carnegie the present
Mrs. Hever was known as a beautiful
young woman with a pronounced fond
ness for outdoor life. She cared little
for society, although she had been
much sought after since her formal
coming out a few years aso. She is
now about twenty-four years old. Al
ways a daring horsewoman, she has
been especially devoted to cross-coun
try riding. In appearance she re
sembles her mother in her small but
sturdy build.
Miss Nancy Carnegie was amone the
bridesmaids at the weddinu in Pitts
burg of Miss Alice Thaw and the Earl
of Yarmouth.
Hever, who is about thirty-five years
old, is already known in Pittsburg.
where it was said to-day that he comes
of good Irish stock and was raised as
a foster child in an aristocratic family
near Dublin. He has several children
by a former marriage. When he came
to America to make his own wav in
the world, his knowledge of horses se
cured him engagements as coachman
and riding master.
Hever had been engaged as riding
master In this city and Newport, where
he married Mlsb Carnegie. Then, for
three years, he had been employed as
coachman by her mothef, Mrs. Thomas
M. Carnegie at Pittsburg, Dunpeness
6a., and Fernandino, Florida.
It Is understood the couple will reside
In the country- Carnegie presented his
niece with $20,000. Her mother Is very
â¢wealthy.

MME. TETRAZZINI CAUSES ARREST

Is Charged With Embezzle
ment of 27,000 Francs. V
Withholds Funds That Were
to Be Sent to Europe.
Accused Says He Gave Money
to Brokers to Forward.
Tetrazzini, the queen of songr, whose
achievements were the sensation of
the recent grand opera season at the
Ttvoli. was startled on Monday by the
receipt of news from Milan demand
ing that she pay certain debts, which
until that moment she had believed to
have been fully liquidated by her fin
ancial agent, the man who came with
her from Mexico a.ncl had handled her
funds throughout important engage
ments.
The famous soprano was at the mo
ment about to start for the City of
Mexi< o to fill an engagement, but Bhe
halted and caused the arrest of Lulio
Zieguer Uriburu, her financial agent,
to whom she had intrusted 27,000
francs for the payment of various ob
ligations in Europe.
Last night Uriburu was arrested as
he dined at Tait's cafe and in jail a
few hours later he admitted he had
received the money, but maintained
that he had given it to two brokers â
one in Mexico and one here â with in
structions to transmit it to Tetraz
zini's creditors in Europe.
Though reluctant to talk of the af
fair, Uriburu intimated that jealousy
in certain quarters might account for
his position. He spoke of having
known the song bird for ten years and
intimated that the <""ien4shijj between
diva and financial apent "~hs*fe : '"been a
strong one, leaving the inference that
a rival in her affections had doubt
less put the prisoner in the sorry
plight of a suspect.
SONGBIRD UPSET.
In the sumptuous apartments of
Madame Teti'azzini at the Marie An
toinette all was confusion and excite
ment last night. The fear that she had
been robbed of 27,000 francs struck the
lovely queen of song like a thunderbolt.
All her brilliant singing and all her
hard work here had gone for naught.
The man she had trusted to the
fullest extent with all her financial ar
rangements had apparently deceived
her. Between the loss of her money
and the' loss of her friend she was al
most distracted and on the verge of
collapse.
Last night she began to realize the
full force of the blow and was taken
with a violent attack of hysteria.
Her immediate friends came to her
with all thr* solicitation at their com
mand and tried to assuage her grief.
They were only partly successful, how
ever, for early in the evening she suc
cumbed to the strain and was put to
bed.
She denied herself to all visitors.
The nurse sent down word to callers
that Madame Tetrazzini was too ill to
see any one.
Signor Bazelli, a friend of Tetrazzlnl's
who sang with her here durine: the re
cent engagement at the Trivoli. con
sented to speak to her and told the
following side of her story:
"Yes, Madame Tetrazzini has been
robbed of 27,000 francs. She gave this
money to her financial agent, Uriburu,
to send for her to Europe to pay cer
tain obligations. Not one cent of this
money ever reached the parties for
whom It was intended. When Tetraz
zini left Milan she owed quite a
large sum of money there. This she
gave Uriburu to send for her. and she
supposed the account was settled.
HEARS SAD NEWS.
"Judge of her amazement when on
Monday she received a letter from the
firm in Milan stating that as she had
had a highly successful season of opera
in this city they were greatly surprised
that Bhe had not liquidated the debt.
Yesterday a similar letter reached her
from another creditor. She sent for
Uriburu, but his attempts at explana
tion were so unsatisfactory that she
sent for Attorney Alexander Heyne
man and 6wore out warrants for Uri
buru's arrest.
"Uriburu is, I understand, very high
ly connected. His family is a distin
guished one. He was Consul nQ^neral
for the Argentine Republic at tlÂ»,Clty
of Mexico. He always said he was a
man of unlimited means. We met him
first in Buenos Ayres. He was smart
and bright, and as Tetrazzini-tneeded
some one to manage her s financial
transactions and as Uriburu x&a thor
oughly conversant with business mat
ters she placed all her affairs in hii
hands. , . .
"When Tetrftzzini wanted to send
money away, 'Uriburu would take It,
and then pretend to send it through the
Swiss-American Bank to the parties for
whom it was intended. He would show
Tetrazzini a 'fake' duplicate draft
which he represented to her waa a
draft issued by the bank in regular
form.
HOW IT WAS DONE.
"H" would tell her at the same time
that he had forwarded the original of
the draft to Europe for the parties to
whom she desired the money sent. He
must have takqn these blank drafts se
cretly away tiom the bank and then
filled them out himself, i understand
that he was well acquainted with W.
Loalaa and that he has borrowed
money from him. We all thought Uri
buru was rich. He made magnificent
presents to all of us connected with
the company. He gave me this fine
gold watch and chain and these hand
som* gold trinkets attached to it.
"Tetrazzini and myself had signed
contracts to open in a season of opera
to begin next week in the City of Mexi
co. We were all ready to depart from
here last night when this sensation was
sprung on us. There is no truth in
the report that there was any love af
fair between Tetrazzini and Uriburu.
That is ridiculous. They were simply
on commonplace friendly terms. He
only acted as her financial agent. That
was all. I don't know when we shall
start for the City of Mexico. Tetrazzini
must stay and see this affair straight
ened out. It may cause us to lose our
coming engagements."
Uriburu was much disturbed over his
arrest and showed his displeasure after
<â 
he had been placed * behind .the" bars at
the City Prison. ;At j, first %he wag re
luctant to discuss the case, v even â  with
the ; police, t but , at f length he *i became
; more ; conversant I and threw dark " hints

says his family Isfone of the most high

greatly astonished.
Wanrell said:
"He dined with myself and a friend

conscience. Ah, I cannot imagine it.
Tes, he and I were to take Tetrazzini
to Mexico to-morrow or the next day.
He was to have come with me to the

FACTS VERIFY
OLD LEGEND
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. April 19. â Until they
were offered for sale a while ago few
persons were aware that there still
existed in England a herd of wild
white cattle have been the most cher
descendants of the aboriginal bulls
and cows that were kept by the an
oient Britons. For centuries the
white cattle have been the most cher
ished possession of the family of Ear!
Ferrers at their famous Chartley es
tate in Staffordshire. It was first es
tablished there in the reign of Henry
111.
All that remains of the once mighty
herd that used to roam through the
forests and over the moors surround
ing Chartley â less than a dozen shag
gy beasts â have just been bought by
the Duke of Bedford. Their disposal
in this lashion puts the finishing
touches to the singular N verificaUon of
an ancient legend that the birth of
black calves in the herd portended
death or dire disaster to the family
or :*Â« possessions.
The legend began to be respected in
1322. after the battle of Burton
bridge between Edward II and his
revolted Barons, with a Ferrers
among them. A blacK calf betng born
that year at Chartley and the second
downfall of the house ensuing â the
first had been preceded by a similar
occurrence â this was imputed to the
black quadruped rather than to the
impolitic patriotism of the Earl, and
it was ruthlessly slaughtered.
FORTUNES OF ESTATKS.
By marriage Chartley passed to the
Shirleys, who were oppressed by
Cromwell ac royalists and later re
warded by Charles II with the revival
of the Ferrers barony. The Earl Fer
rers of Queen Anne's time had fifteen
â¢son* and twelve daughters, which
greatly impoverished the patrimony.
His grandson, the notorious Lawrence,
Earl Ferrers, was executed at Tyburn
in 1760 for the murder of his stew
ard. According to superstitious chron
iclers every vicissitude in the affairs
of the family has been heralded by
the birth %t a black calf.
The present Earl Ferrers showed
his contempt for the legend by intro
ducing a black bull into the herd. His
object was, to combat the decadence
resulting from continuous inbreeding
by introducing a new strain. In 1903
several black calves were born in the
herd. This intentional sullying of the
whiteness of the breed was followed
by what folk who take pride in noble
heritages regard as the crowning dis
aster in the annals of the family â
the Bale of the entire estate, feudal
fortress, hlstoria associations, park,
broad acres and all the rest, at auc
tion.
And thus was lost to the family a
property which though it had many
times changed hands through death,
through marriage, or at the sword's
point, had never been subjected to the
ignominious fate of being bartered for
current coin. Now that the herd it
self has been sold none of the Earl's
former tenants at Chartley believe that
his descendants will ever regain pos
session of the estate.
HERD IN GOOD HANDS.
However, the herd has fallen Into
good hands. Both the Duke and
Duchess of Bedford are devoted to
dumb animals of all sorts and have
the largest private collection in the
country. They can be trusted to apply
the restorative remedies necessary to
perpetuate these investing relics â the
introduction of fresh blood and the
rearing of new born calves by foster
mothers.
Professor Robert Wallace suggests
that the off-colored caJves of these
white cattle, instead of being slaught
ered as has heretofore been the cus
tom, should be collected in one part?
and allowed to breed indiscriminately.
"The possibilities are great," he
says, "of obtaining profoundly inter
esting scientific as well as useful prac
tical results from efforts made in that
direction. Had a proposition of simi
lar scientific interest to America arisen
in that country, the calves in question
would no doubt have been bought by
the Department of Animal Industry,
or such an institution as the State
Agricultural College at Ames, lowa,

NAN PATTERSON AGAIN ON
TRIAL. IN NEW YORK FOR THE
MI'ROER OF CAESAR Â¥WN6.
GIFT TO KING
BY CARNEGIE
Special Dlsuatth to The Call.
LONDON, April 19.â Americans who
have given the English town of Ply
mouth a place in their European itin
eraries for this summer will be inter
ested in a story told by Dr. William J.
Holland, director of the Carnegie In
stitution at Pittsburg. Dr. Holland is
here to superintend the setting up of a
replica of the great diplodocus which
Andrew Carnegie has presented to King
Edward and which, at his Majesty's
suggestion, is being placed in the nat
ural history branch of the British Mu
seum. In company with Arthur Cogge
shall, one of the Carnegie Institution's
department heads. Dr. Holland landed
at Plymouth from an incoming Ameri
can liner and decided to spend Sunday
in the town.
Part of Sunday they gaVe to a walk
about the old seaport, following as far
as possible the footsteps of the pilgrims
of 1620. One place after another said to
have been associated with the historic
emigrants they visited, until finally
they met a native who offered to Bhow
them the actual house in which the
band met for the last time before set
ting out on their famous voyage.
Interested, of course. Dr. Holland and
his colleague were taken to a building
of suitably ancient appearance, while
the native retailed the legends of the
last days before the Mayflower's sail
ing. Dr. Holland, however, went so fax
as to look up the owner of the building.
"And so there's where our ancestors
met nearly 300 years back. 1b it?" he
asked.
"Not that I know of," replied the
owner. "I built that house about forty
years ago."
The diplodocus which Dr. Holland
and his colleague brought with them
will be the largest representation of A
quadruped in the British Museum. Un
der the direction of Dr. Holland thÂ«
replica has been made with such care
that it minutely resembles the real
skeleton, which the doctor himself
helped take out of the ground In Wyo
ming a few years ago. Thanks to care
ful packing, it has come across the
ocean without accident, and as the ma
hogany bases upon which it will stand
have already been made in London
there will be no delay in getting the
huge creature into place. In shape It
somewhat resembles a mastodon and is
nearly thirty feet from the tip of it*
nose to the end of its tail.
Early in May Carnegie will come to
London to present his gift in person.
Although this presentation will be a
ceremonious affair, its details have not
yet been aranged. It is very likely,
however, that either the King or some
member of the royal family will receive
the diplodocus.
While not actually at work on the
diplodocus. Dr. Holland will give his
time to studying his favorite branches
of natural history. Sir George Hamp
sdn, director of the insect department
of the museum, has given Dr. Holland
a place in one of the large front rooms
of the building, and this will be the
doctor's headquarters while in London.
Dr. Holland, whose present visit to
London is his fourteenth, is well known
to the scientific societies here, and al
ready has renewed his acquaintance
with several of their most distinguished
members.
where 800 cattle of many different
breeds are available for experimental
and teaching work. Results 'of pro
found scientific interest to the whole
bucolic world could hardly have failed
to develop from the action."

"The first section of the long-prom

"If the quick, sharp slump comes in

exceptions, as both will hold firm and
then shoot ahead.
"During the past three weeks the

their turn. It's mine now.
"As 1 have "friends at court 1 who post

STRANGER FOUND DEAD IN
HALLWAY OF LODGING-HOUSE
Lifeless Body of Man Supposed to Be
Louis Hubner Is Found by a
Japanese Servant.
A man, supposed to be Louis Hubner.
formerly an employe of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company, vvas found
dead in a hallway at the Sainte Marie,
a lodging house at 1233 Polk street, yes
terday afternoon.
The dead man had probably wander
ed into the house to visit a lady friend
whose letters were found in his pockets.
By the side of the body was found a
partly consumed bottle of carbolic acid.
A union book of the Marine Cooks' and
Stewards' Association was in a coat
pocket and a medal for bravery, bear
ing the name of Louis Hubner and
dated 1902, given him by the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company, was among
his effects. The dead man had evi
dently been playing the rates, as two
grandstand tickets, dated April 18. and
a check for admittance to the paddock
were in the pockets of his clothine.
Mrs. Oakley, the proprietor of the
Sainte Marie, was peculiarly reticent
about the affair and would not talk
upon the subject, saying; that she did
not know who the alleged suicide was
and that he had never been in her
house before. She did not know who
the woman residing at the Sainte Marie
could be who wrote the young man the
letters signing her name "Wad."

Franz Bopp, former German Con

The retirement of Adolph Rosenthal
is deeply regretted by the local Ger

Francisco merchants who had occa
sion to transact business with him
during his long term of service in this
city. He was dean of the diplomatic
corps in San Francisco and enjoyed
the respect of the representatives of

time he killed himself.
In the case of James Walsh, a

due to the carelessness of the foreman-.
In the case of Charles Steigler, a

pital badly injured.
The men entered the place about mid
night and ordered drinks. When Jes
mond started to serve them he heard
the order. "Throw up your hands," and
when- he turned faced a leveled re
volver. Jesmond, instead of obeying,
jumped over the bar and grappled
with the man who held the pistol.
The other man drew a revolver and
beat Jesmond over the head until he
fell senseless. Then the pair opened
the till and took $50 in gold and a
small amount of silver. Jesmond did
not recover consciousness until the
robbers had made good their escape.
The men were roughly dressed. One
of them was clean shaven and the
other wore a dark mustache. The lat
ter is the one that struck Jesmond on
the head with the revolver. His part
ner cried, "Kill the !"
At the hospital it was found that
Jesmnnd had possibly a fracture of
the skull. He is certain that he can
identify the robbers. The police were
notified and detectives are now scour
ing the Mission district in search of
the desperadoes.

SACRAMENTO, April 19.â The tak
ing of testimony in the case of the
people against Harry Bunkers, former
State Senator, charged with bribery,
began before Judge Hart this morning.
Clarence Grange, secretary of the
Phoenix Building and Loan Association
of San Francisco, was the first witness.
He testified that January 21 last Joseph
Jordan called upon him and said that
the Bunkers Senatorial committee was
about to investigate the "BiK Four"
loan associations and had issued sub
penas, and that something must be
done or there would be trouble.
At this point the defense objected
that as a conspiracy was charged,
nothing that was said between Jordan
and Grange in the absence of Bunker
was admissible until a conspiracy to
do wrong had been established.
The prosecution urged that the pro
posed testimony tended to establisu
the conspiracy and that subsequent re
citals would show the relation of the
conversation to that conspiracy.
After a lengthy argument the court
ruled the statements proposed to be
admissible with the understanding that
if it developed that there was no con
nection between them and the alleged
conspiracy the testimony should be
stricken out. To that ruling the de
fendant excepted.
Grange then told the story of his
connection with the exposure of the
Senators. His testimony was practi
cally the same as given by him before
the legislative committee.
W. H. Govan testified that he is
keeper of the State archives and to the
identity of the journals of the Senate.
These showed the composition of the
Committee on Commissions and Re
trenchment and that Bunkers, French.
Wright and Emmons were members of
that committee; that they were sworn
in as Senators; that the committee was
by resolution given power to issue sub
penas and administer oaths; that
charges were preferred against Bunk
ers, Wright, Emmons and French; that
a committee of investigation was ap
pointed; with that committee certain
exhibit* were filed, and those docu
ments, said District Attorney Seymour,
could not be found, but may be discov
ered before the close of the trial.
Henry Hartling of San Francisco
then testified to the alleged bribing of
Bunkers by Jordan. His testimony was
the same as given before the legisla
tive committee.
Hartling was subjected to a long and
severe cross-examination, but he ad
hered to all his statements given in di
rect examination.
The trial will be resumed \o-morrow
morning. It is expected that the testi
mony for the prosecution will be con
cluded to-morrow. For the defense It
Is understood that witnesses from dif
ferent parts of the State will be subpe
naed, and some of those from San
Francisco will be called to testify to
the previous good reputation of Bunk
ers.

POLICE SEARCH
FOR HYPNOTIST
Professor Anton Weber Is
Accused of Fleecing an
Aged Couple Out of $2000
TELL A STBANGE STOKY
Victims Assert That Fugi-
tive Induced Them to Draw
Money From Oakland Bank
SAN JOSE, April 19. â Hypnotized
and robbed of $2000 and with their
minds temporarily wrecked, Mr. and
Mrs. Frank A. Drew, who recently
came to California from New Hamp
shire, have asked the police to ar
rest Professor Anton Weber, a clair
voyant and mind reader, who for two
weeks operated in this city.
Last Monday Drew and his wife
were taken from a house on St. John
street, raving mad. They had barri
caded themselves behind doors and
said they were the King and Queen
of Heaven. A night of detention and
rest partially brought them to their
senses and then they began unfolding
a tale of robbery and control exer
cised over them by Weber, to whom
they had gone a week before for ad
vice. Mrs. Drew has sworn to a com
plaint charging Weber with grand lar
ceny, in that he has $2000 of her
money, and the police throughout the
State have been asked to arrest the
clairvoyant and also take into cus
tody his wife, who is supposed to be
with him.
Drew and his wife came here from
Oakland about two weeks ago. They
had had trouble there, and, seeing the
glaring advertisement* of Professor
Weber, they consulted him. The clair
voyant learned they had considerable
money and he suggested to them that
he could aid them greatly in a finan
cial way if they had $2000 to invest in
wheat, pork, lard or corn. He also
suggested he could free them from
the trouble that affected them. Ac
cording to Mrs. Drew's story, Weber
clipped a lock of hair from the head
of her husband and herself and a
small piece from the nail of each of
their forefingers. These he mixed with
a powder and ignited, the result was
a heavy incense, which he ordered
them to inhale. A tickling sensation
and a sense of strangulation followed.
DIRECTED TO GET MONEY.
Weber then ordered Drew and his
wife to go home and remain in the
house without seeing any one. This
was a week ago Monday. The next
day Mrs. Weber went to the Drews'
home and treated the couple by pass
ing her hands over their foreheads,
evidently hypnotizing them. She visit
ed them the next day and on last
Thursday told the couple to accom
pany her to her husband's office. The
Drews obeyed and Professor Weber
then directed them to go to Oakland
and draw $2000 from the bank and re
turn to San Jose. The Drews went to
Oakland, secured the money and re
turned at once to Professor Weber's
office. The clairvoyant told them to
take the money home, place It under
their pillows for the night and then
bring it to him. This they did.
Weber then sent the couple home and
told them to remain in the house until
they had received a telegram from
him directing them where to meet him
in San Francisco. That was on last
Saturday morning.
HYPNOTIST DISAPPEARS.
From last Thursday till last Monday
the Drews had practically nothing to
eat. for in their desire to obey the
clairvoyant they did not dare to go
outdoors. When arrested they had
wrecked nearly everything in the
house.
Weber and his wife left the city last
Sunday morning. When the police
went to the Angelus, where they had
rooms, last night to Interview the pro
fessor and his wife they found a notice
on the door that the parties were out
of town and would not return until
next Saturday. An investigation of
the rooms to-day shows, that every
thing had been removed by the
Webers and that they did not intend
to return. Every effort will be made
I to capture them.
The Drews are from Milford, N. H.,
and evidently people of means. At the
house they occupied were found bank
books showing that they had many
thous-ands of dollars on denosit in
Eastern banks.- Drew was formerly
engaged in the marble and stone busi
ness, but retired a few years ago.
Drew and his wife are at a sanitarium
and it is believed they will be all
right in a few days.

LARGE WHEAT
CROP EXPECTED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, April 19.â Present pros
pects point to an immense grain crop
being harvested in Lower California.
With the promise of plenty of water
much ground was planted. The Lower
California Development Company has
about 27,000 acres, Manager J. H. Pack
ard has about 14,000 acres and there
are at least 3000 acres outside of these
two holdings. The grain looks fine and
there seems now no danger save from
rust, and that is remote. Not only is
the acreage large, but the yield will be

The Teachers' Annuity Fund is low.
The teachers ho have given the best
years of their lives to teaching and
gliding and counseling are no longer
assured of the small revenue that
Bhould be theirs when they have laid
down the burden for younger shoulders.
And thus it is that these sierantic
concerts, such as are presented yearly j
in London and Berlin, are to be civenâ '
to replenish the treasury of the An- I
nuity Fund, that San Francisco may '
keep faith with her old and honored
teachers.

tickets.
These coupon books are being snaD
ped up, selling for $10. $7 50 and $5: [
these are exchangeable and cover every
one of the fifteen performances.
Altogether these May festivals prom- !
ise to be the greatest musical revel
Ban Francisco has ever known, not ex- !
â¢ opting our late grand opera, with all i
its splendor of art and atmosphereâ I
for the bulk of the people, the plain I
people, were denied the privileges of it. i
But 'twill be another story out at the I

The thrill that comes with musicâ i

the seats won't cost a week's salary.
This Is the Plain People's opera.

MORMON CHIEF
AT PRIZE FIGHT
â¢ Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, April 19. â President
Jqseph F. Smiths presence at the
Schreck-Gardner prize fight on Mon
day night has drawn forth another bit
ter public criticism from a prominent
member of the Mormon church, J. F.
Gibbs.
In an open letter published to-day
Gibbs refers to Smith as a "patron
saint of prize fighting," challenging the
president's claim to being a "prophet,
seer and revelutor," and charges that
"among his own people Joseph F.
Smith is regarded as a self-confessed
defller of the laws of God and man."
In the closing paragraph of his letter
Gibbs says the fact that Smith "took
eight of his sons and witnessed a
brutal slugging match should not. after
his antics before the Senate committee
and since, excite any more comment
than would the presence there of any
other old sport, nor does it concern any
one as to the amount he won on the
result, although a lot of people, Mor
mons and Gentiles, are now speculat
ing on that question."
Gibbs,. who has been a Mormon aIP
his life, repudiates Smith as leader of
the church and charges the president
with having convicted the whole Mor
mon people as violators of the pledge
given to the Government.

lowing water. The symptoms gradu
ally became more pronounced until
convulsions developed. Between the
spasmÃ he was perfectly rational and
had his bride take him to a hospital

do nothing to check the convulsions

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 19.â When the clos
ing bell Btruck on 'change to-day, the
leading question with the wheat trade
was: "Did the bull clique get out of
2,000,000 or 3,000,000 bushels, throueh
two or three houses, without starting
anything like a panicVin the pit?"
The May price was pushed up to
$115% early, on buying which was
traced to Armour, brokers thousrht.
While this was going on Counselman
brokers were sellers of 500.000 or 750.000
bushels. Later, brokers believed to
have been acting for the Gates cliaue
took a hand in the selling, while the
May price broke from *1 15% to $1 13%.

understanding between the bier bull
traders and the big shorts. For this
reason many were predicting an early
end of the deal, without any fireworks.

who attended the butchers' meetine to
draft resolutions denouncing the West
ern packers, or to frame a schedule of
increased prices for Manhattan butch
ers, but all those present agreed that
they must, in self-protection, raise their
prices. Many, Indeed, reported that
they already had done bo and were
charging the public 8 to 5 cents a
pound more for good beef than they
did three weeks ago.

iiiiiiiiiJAPAN MAY CALL UPON HER ALLY TO CHECK FRANCE
TOKIO, April 19. â Should the Baltic fleet persist in its intention to make Kamranh Bay its base, Japan
will call upon Great Britain, her ally, to compel France to observe neutrality by ejecting the Russians.
In the meantime a fleet will be sent to attack the Russian ships in French waters should they remain. It
is evident that Rojestvensky intends to await the arrival of the third Pacific squadron, which would give
him a numerical superiority over Togo's fleet.

FEAR TORPKIX) ATTACKS.
Russian* Would Prefer a Qeneral
Battle on the Open Sea.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 19.â ThÂ»
keenest interest is manifested in the
dispatches referring to the Russian
squadron commanded by Admiral Ro
jestvensky. but the Admiralty claims
to be as much in the dark as the public
regarding the plan<* of the admiral.
The report that part of the squadron
was sighted off Hongkong is not cred
ited here, as Hongkong is far off his
route.
ThÂ« main question now agitating the
naval officials is whether Rojestvensky
will elect to proc^fd northward
through the Straits of Formosa or bear
off into the Pacific through Baschi
channel, north of the is)an<l of Luzon.
The conviction is growing stronger
that the Japanese heavy division is
concentrating close to the shores ot
Japan and it is believed that Admiral
Togo will decline to give battle in the
open sea. Thi6 is what the Admiralty
officials hope for, as it believes Rojest
vensky would have more than an even
chance if the two squadr.ns lined up
In an open fight. They believe that
Togo's tactics will be night torpedo
boat attacks, in attempts to scatter the
Russian ships, putting some of them
out of action and then picking off the
damaged vessels in the morning, as it
recognized that if one of the Russian
ships be injured it might be too dan
gerous for the whole squadron to stand
by her and thus offer a big target for
the Japanese torpedoes. Such a run
ning fight, accompanied by nightly tor
pedo attacks, therefore, is what is most
dreaded.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 20. 1905.
CASSINI SHARPLY REPLIES
TO BARON KANEKO.
Embassador Denounces Accusatisns Agains
Russian Soldiers in Manchuria.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL. BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, April 19.â "Not once,
but many times, has General Kuropat
kin ordered his troops to treat Japanese
captives and wounded not as enemies,
hut as considerately as they would
their brothers. These orders have been
obeyed. They will continue to be
obeyed. That Baron Kaneko should
have so low an estimate of the intelli
gence of the American public as to tell
such unfounded stories of cruel treat
ment of Japanese prisoners as he has
been credited with relating is a mat
ter of astonishment to me."
Such was the comment made by
Count Cassini, the Russian Embassa
dor to-dny in regard to a speech made
by Baron Kentaro Kaneko last Friday
at a meeting held at the home of Mrs.
Mason Davidge in New York City, for
the purpose of raising funds Cor the
wlduwfl and orphans of Japanese
soldiers.
Boron Kaneko, who has mcÂ»Â«le many
speeches and written many articles for
publication in the United State* since
the war beg-an, charged Russia with
having broken every article of the
Geneva convention, violated every
principle of humanity and outraged
every maxim of decency.
Count Cassini declared he would not
let the accusations pass unnoticed, and
said:
"With the Russian armies are Ameri
can officers, acting as attaches. There
also arÂ« newspaper correspondents
representing the American press. The
gentlemen are granted facilities for
seeing what is going on. They are not
constantly guarded and barred from a
view of operations, as is the cage in the
Japanese armies. Their eyes are open
and they are permitted to see. Is it
not strange that some of these gen
tlemen, disinterested as they unques
tionably are, have not mentioned some
thing of the cruelties described by
Baron Kaneko, if such wrongs were
practiced?
"The answer is obvious. No such
cruelties have occurred or will occur.
The Russian soldier is not by nature
cruel. He has no desire to willfully in
jure those .who fall helplessly into his
power. It is incredible that Baron
Kaneko should believe that sufficient
credulity exists in this country as to
permit htm to put forward such state
ments as his tale that 200 Japanese
captives were led bound together
through the streets of Mukden, and
that their Russian cantors invited the
Chinese populace to offer them insult.
"As to the charge that Russia has
broken every article of the Geneva
convention, I have only to say that the
Japanese gentleman is apparently for
getful of his own Government's disre
gard of the ethics of international in
tercourse.
"It is known to all the world that the
Japanese, without warning, made tor
pedo attacks on the Russian fleet at
Port Arthur and attacked the V'ariag
and Korietz at Chemulpo, a neutral
harbor, before war had been declared.
It was more defiant of international
comity in that assurances had already
been given to the United States that
Japan would not begin hostilities un
til after a formal declaration of war.
"Japan is too young a nation to pre
sume to give lessons in civilization aad.
custom to the European Governments
and America."
GASSIXI WILTi REMAIN.

Rosen In Washington.
ST. PETERSBURG. April 19.â The
report that Baron de Rosen, formerly
Russian Minister in Tokio, would suc
ceed Count Cassini. Russian Embaa
sador to the United States. Is not con
firmed at the Foreign Office here. On
the contrary, it is said that Count
Cassini's services in Washington are
highly valued and that no change at
present is contemplated.
JAPAN'S IRRITATION GROWS.
Inland Press Continues Its Agitation
Against France.
ToKIO. April 19. â Although not
reported directly, it is believed that
the Russian second Pacific squadron
continues the occupation of Kam
ranh Bay or some other port of An
nam. where it is expected to remain
until joined by the third Russian Pa
cific squadron.
The report that Admiral Rojest
vensky is a patrol and
examining neutral shipping off Kam
ranh Bay increases the irritation to
ward France for permitting the use
of that port as a base of operations.
The Japanese Government continues
silent regarding the representations
on this subject which have been made
to France. The press, however, con
tinues its agitation against France,
demanding vigorous action.

April 19.â The German steamship
Juliette, late the British steamship
Donnolly Castle, which cleared from

day and asked for 900 tons of coal.
She was informed that she would be
allowed to take 600 tons, but when
100 tons had been taken on board the
Colonial Office stopped her from tak
ing any more, pending instructions
from the home Government. The ac
tion of the locrl officials was due to
statements made by members of the
new that the Juliette is carrying
stores to the Russian squadron In, the
China Sea.
JAPAN PROTESTS TO FRANCE.
Elder Statesmen Draw Up n strongly
Worded Accusation.
TOKIO. April 19. â At a conference

violations of neutrality i n providing

and now at Kamranh Bay. No an

ANGLERS HONOR
PRINCETON SAGE
Dr. Henry Van Dyke Is En
tertained by Members of
Famous Fly casting (lub
JUDGE HUNT PRESIDES
Charming Tributes Are Paid
the Guest of the Evening
and the Art of Fishing
Dr. Henry Van Dyke, the Princeton
savant, who is hailed as the Isaak
Walton of to-day, was the guest of the
San Francisco Flycasting Club last
night at a dinner at the California Ho
tel. The speeches sounded as deep and
as true as the roar of the rivers the
anglers love so well and brought out
all the love of nature which is the chief
characteristic of the angler.
Dr. Van Dyke is the author of two
classics on the gentle art of angling,
"Fishermen's Luck" and "Little Riv
ers." During his stay in California
he has had the coul-stirring experience
of landing a seven-pound Dolly Varden
trout on the mighty McCloud, the story
of which was charmingly told by
Charles S. Wheeler.
To prove it was no fisherman's yarn
the great game fish was exhibited to
the assembled guests on a huge silver
platter, which set off its brilliant color
ing to advantage.
VOGELSANG MAKES A HIT.
Of all the speeches, that of Alex Vo
gelsang created the greatest impres
sion, especially on the ladies, who had
pre-empted a bench just outside the
door of the banquet room. Mr. Vogel
sang, who was in his happiest mood,
did lull justice to his subject, 'The Sci-
entific Angler," even to the apt illus
tration with which he closed his re-
marks.
President Edward Everett presided
and introduced Judge Hunt as the
toastmaster. The latter was in his hap
piest mood. He spoke of the guest of
the evening as a scholar and a sports
man; a student both of books and of
nature; a writer and a fisherman. He
said he found his text in the voice of
I the stream and was a delightful inter
: preter of all that is beautiful in nature.
Dr. Van Dyke said he had been wad-
ing in the McCloud recently and he
\ felt sure there was nothing colder than
; California water nor warmer than
1 California hospitality. He spoke of fly
j fishing as a lofty, ennobling occupa
; tion. He said some people looked upon
it as a mild form of lunacy, but he had
found it dainty, charming and pleas
ant to the finer sensibilities. He spoke
of Isaak Walton's Compleat Angler as
1 a classic in literature. He praised the
McCloud as an ideal stream, the real
ization of an angler's dream.
DR. VAN DYKE TALKS OF TROUT.
Dr. Van Dyke told several stories
and preached a dainty sermon. One of
his stories was of the Scotchman, who
after an unsuccessful day on the river
tossed his riyhook into the stream and
said in disgust: "Tak' yer choice!"
He also told of the great trout Nico
demus on the River Never Sink and
of the man who tried to take him. In
the morning he tried a red ibis. The
trout got away with this. Later in the
day he had him on a white miller and
again his Troutship disappeared. In
the evening he tried him with a blue
jay and after a struggle landed him.
The three flies were fastened to the
trout and when the angler saw the na
tional colors he remembered it was
the Fourth of July and he knew why
the combination had proved so effec
tive.
Governor Pardee sent his regrets. In
voicing them Judge Hunt combined the
introduction of Dr. Jordan of Stanford
University, saying:
"The 'Governor' is a good fly, but the
'professor' is a better one." Dr. Jor
dan created a laugh by addressing his
auditors as "fellow geologists." He
said: "The trout lie at the bottom of
green streams. Let us lie about the
trout." He spoke entertainingly of the
anglers of Samoa, Japan and Honolulu.
He took a rise out of Judge Hunt by
telling how the latter loaned his trout
scales to a lady who found they re
corded the weight of her baby as being
sixty-eight pounds.
Charles S. Wheeler told how grace
fully and how skillfully Dr. Van Dyke
had landed the seven-pound Dolly
Varden and paid a fine tribute to the
guest of the evening. Those present

CHICAGO STRIKE
GAINS RECRUITS
CHICAGO, April 19.â Although influ
ences are still at work in the hope that
an amicable adjustment of the diffi
culty existing between the teamsters
and Montgomery Ward & Co. may be
reached, the indications to-night are
that the strike of the teamsters will
spread to other concerns. To-day 150
drivers employed by the E. M. Forbes
Teaming Company were ordered on
strike because the firm insisted on
making deliveries to Montgomery
Ward & Co.. President Shea of the In
ternational Brotherhood of Teamsters
declared to-night he would order out
all drivers engaged by firms that in
sisted on delivering supplies to the big
store.
The new Employers* Teaming* Com
pany began aggressive action against
the striking^ teamsters to-day by deliv
ering coal to Montgomery Ward & Co.
The Coal Team Owners' Association
has arranged for a conference to-mor
row with the Employers' Association,
when another effort to effect a setle
ment of the strike will be made. The
Team Owners' Association will present
a proposition to arbitrate everything in
dispute. Nothing of a tangible nature
is expected to result from this confer
ence, as Montgomery Ward & Co. have
steadfastly refused to arbitrate the de
mands of the garment workers, al
though offering to adopt conciliatory
measures with the teamsters. The gar
ment workers' places have been filled,
and Montgomery Ward & Co. assert
there is nothing tp arbitrate.

LEADVILLE. Colo.. April 1Â». â
Armed deputies in charge of Sheriff

OAKLAND, April 19.â Battle over
the purchase by C. L. Walker, presi
dent of the Red River Lumber Com
pany of Minnesota arid a several times
millionaire of the Northwest, of the
John Gilcrest mansion at Oakland and
Monte Vista avenues is impending.
T. C. Ccogan, a prominent attorney
of San Francisco and Oakland, is also
named as a buyer of the beautiful
Piedmont home, but Walker holds pos
session of the property and has set
tled dovi-n intending to stay.
Cilcrest. who is land agent in Oregon
for Miller & Lux. the cattle kings, has
scent of the contest. He left his af
fairs in the hands of E. A. Heron, the
capitalist, who holds a power of at
torney and has taken the first steps
toward recovering the mansion in the
hill district.
The deal by which Walker acquired
the Gilcrest home was completed last
week through the Realty Bends and
Finanr-e Oimpany, which had held a
contract on the place. While negotia
tions were in progress with the Min
nesota millionaire the firm of J. H.
Macdonaid & Co. was handling the
same property for E. A. Heron, who
represented Gilcrest. Attorney Coogan
appeared as a purchaser and had made
a tender for the handsome residence,
which had been accepted. Meanwhile
the Walker transaction was consum
mated, and correspondence with Gil
crest, who was in Oregon, seemed to
confirm the deal.
Three days after Walker had bought
the place and waa sending artisans to
install household belongings notice
was served on the Realty Bond and
Finance Company that its contract of
sale with Gilorest had expired. This
was after word had been sent to Heron
that the sale had been made to Walker.
The claim is set up by Heron that
the contract of sale had expired many
months ago, that there was no proper
notice sent to Gilcrest as to the trans
action with Walker, and that the
agents had no authority to make it.
Neither of the realty firms will discuss
the sale or the steps that may be taken
in view of the involved situation.
At the former Gilcrest residence to
day it wa^s announced that, the Walk
ers had taken possession regularly;
that the keys had been turned over to
the purchaser and that there was noth
ing but a straight buy and sell trans
action, f;i far a>s they were concerned.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. APRIL 20, 1905.
PUTS A STOP
TO "SHAVING"
Police and Fire Board Sets
Its Foot Down Upon Dis
count of Salary Warrants
OAKLAND, April 19.â Warrant shav
ing must cease In the police and flre de
partments. Such is the order issued to
day by the Commissioners. Cashing of
salary warrants in advance is Included
in the edict of proscription. The rule is
aimed at the money lenders, who
charge enormous rates of interest for
their loans upon the assigned claims.
Mayor Mott, as spokesman for the
Board of Police and Fire Commission
ers, explained their action as follows:
The praotlce of warrant shaving has become
Intolerable. Firemen and policemen have been,
contributing $4 to $S a month out of their pay
tor the benefit of money lenders who make ad
vance* to the men. This must cease. The or
der may work a hardship on some of the men,
but In the long run they will reap a clean
financial gain. They need the money that gees
to the monry lenders, and should not be per
muted to pay the exorbitant interest charges
that are enforced.
The Commissioners add that failure
to obey the new order will be taken as
sufficient reason to dismiss the offender
from the city's service.

Ruess and Erri Decoto â probation work gen
erally. The Oakland Club cannot be praised
too much for the splendid work It has done
and it. doing along these lin^. The "first of
fender" that was formerly denied a chance
to reform Is now not only given an oppor
tunity, but la shown the -way. Frequently it
happens that In the probation officers the
youthful criminal finds the nrst real parent lie
has ever known.
But it is not always the street waif without
father or mother that falls under the proba
tion officer's care. Too often It is the indulged
heir of wealthy parents, who are too selfish
or too busy to bother about their offspring. It
never pays for a father or mother to be "too
basx" to get on friendly, confidential terms
with the beings for which they are responsible,
body an 1 soul, and their responsibility does not
ceabe when they have supplied all the food
and clothing necessary.
Mr. IX'coto Is Probation Officer for Alameda
County, and it seems that he is really the
right man In the right place. At any rate,
his reports indicate promising progress in the
work of redemption inagurated by the Oakland
Club.

COLLEGE MEN'S
NOVEL SCHEME
University Students Propose
That Athletic Work Shall
Be Given Desired Credits
PETITION IS PREPARED
Authorities Will Be Asked
to Make Field or Track
Feats Count for Units
BERKELEY, April 19.â An Innovation
at the University of California is pro
posed by men who are interested par
ticularly in athletics there, it being de
sired that athletes shall be given schol
arship credits for work done as such.
The iconoclasts who propose the idea
would have bo much football work rank
against so much Greek or Latin lore
learned or studied and other athletic
feats in proportion.
A petition, addressed to the univer
sity authorities, asking that the new
plan be adopted, is in circulation on the
campus, and when sufficient signatures
are procured the document will be filed
with Recorder Sutton. The petition
reads as follows:
To the honorable faculty of ths University
of California: Whereas, Athletics arÂ« encour
aged by members of the faculty and students
are urged to participate In the samÂ«; and,
Whereas, Btudents who devote time to ath
letlqs are graded In parallel with students who
are enabled to spend the time thus saved In
perfecting themselves In their courses; and.
Whereas. It is manifestly unfair to ta
poet of athletes the same scholastic attain
ments as ol students who spend the aforesaid
time in preparing first grade recitations; and,
Wh<?reas. A high degree of proficiency In
atblet!cs would roriound to the honor and
fame of the university, and to develop the
highest possible degree of proficiency, the un
dersigned petitioners would suggest that the
following amendments be made In the grading
of elective credits:
The following athletic sports, to wit: Foot
ball, tennis, baseball and boating, shall be
graded by a committee of three members here
after to be appointed, one to be appointed by
the fc cully, one by the associated students and
these two to appoint a third. It In suggested
that the grading be along the following lines:
FcntbAll. three hours' credit; baseball, two
hours; tennis, one hour; boating, two hours;
track, or* hour; providing that the athletes
represent California In Intercollegiate contests.
SAYS HER LAND
HAS NO VALUE
OAKLAND, April 19.â There Is to be
a contest over the property of the late
Frank Silva of Pleasanton, who left an
esate of over $60,000. His second
daughter, Maria Silva Enos, says that
her father left her a quarter-section of
the worst land in that part of the
country, and that it represents an in
finitesimal part of his estate.
In an opposition to the probating of
his will the daughter says that her
father was in love with his niece,
Mariana Lopez, and that he wished to
marry her, but the law forbade it. He,
however, took her to his home, and for
her opposition in this matter Mrs. Enos
says she waa practically disinherited.
The will was made within a few hours
of Silva's death, and she avers he was
incompetent at that time to make one.
To support this she points out that he
has left a 50x100 foot lot on the main
street of Livermore, in the heart of the
business section, for a park, which,
however, the town is not to get for
fifty years. He also directs that $10 a
month shall be paid for masses on his
soul for thirty years, but they are not
to be begun until he has been dead
twenty years.
The property Is divided among the
widow and six children.

MAY PURCHASE
WATER SYSTEM
Residents of San Mateo in
Favor of Acquiring the
Plant Now in Operation
BOARD OF TEADE MOVES
Will Appoint a Committee
to Open Negotiations With
Owner of the Works
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
SAN MATEO, April IÂ».â President
Baskette of the Board of Trade has
been authorized by that body to appoint
a committee of three to negotiate with
William J. Dingee for the purchase of
the San Mateo Water Company's plant
on behalf of the people of San Mateo.
The movement has the sanction of the
City Trustees, is the result of several
years of agitation for municipal own
ership and seems to have the unanim
ous support of the people. The commit
tee when named will arrange a confer
ence with Dingee. If a reasonable price
is named a proposition to issue bonds
to cover the purchase price will be sub
mitted to a vote of the people.
The present water system is owned
by Mrs. Alvin*a Hayward, for whom
Dingee is attorney and agent on this
coast. He has Intimated that if the
people of San Mateo are sincere in a
desire to purchase the property he will
take up the matter with their repre
sentatives.
The present value of the plant is said
to be about $125,000, though eight years
ago Hayward offered to sell It for $30,
000. Since then betterments to the
value of about $60,000 have been added,
including a twenty-five-acre tract on
the marsh, with a large pumping plant
and several artesian wells. These wells
now supply most of the water to con
sumers, but in addition the company
owns a perpetual water supply from
the Spring Valley Company of 300,000
gallons a da}-. The value of this par
ticular asset is undetermined.
The people want municipal water
works, and if the negotiations reach thÂ«
bond issue stage they will' carry by a
large majority. They also desire a
lighting plant, and as the power neces
sary to operate the water system
would also serve for lights it is pro
posed to secure both in one bond issue.
In taking up the question the Board
of Trade, which is thoroughly repre
sentative, is but carying out the wishes
of the people.

MAPPING OUT

Rival Surveying Parties at

Cause Much Speculation
LAND IS BEING BONDED

REDWOOD CITY. April Iâ Two ri
val surveying parties are at work la
this county, but it is not known
they represent. Options on varioua
pieces of land are being secured and
the greatest secrecy Is being main
tained. The Southern Pacific, the West
ern Pacific and the Santa Fe compa
nies and corporation* of smaller mag
nitude figure in the speculation* which
have arisen from the quiet but strenu
ous labors of surveyors and land pur
chasers.
A surveying party headed t>y W. B.
Rodgers is mapping out a route near
Big Creek, approximately half way
from Santa Cru* to Pescadero. This
party Is supposed to represent the
Western Pacific Company. A Southern
Pacific surveying party is running a
line from Boulder Creek to Pescadero.
At the same time the Southern Paciflo
Company is bonding property from
Santa Cms, by way of Garfleld Park,
up the coast to Pescadero.
Southern Pacific engineers are ftstur
ing the cost of various route*, and
uptm their decision will rest the route
construction. It is estimated that the
cost of widening tunnels and changing
the narrow-gauge railroad from Santa
Crux to Alameda into a bro'ad-gaugÂ«
would be about $1,000,000 and it is as
serted that a through line along the
coast, by way of Pescadero. to the
Ocean View broad-gauge, which Is a
distance of sixty miles, would cost no
more.
Such a road, however, would offer. the
tremendous advantage to the Southern
Pacific Company of crippling any com
petition and at the same time opening
a rich and prosperous country included
in the Pescadero and HaJfmoon Bay
valleys. One of the immediate needs of
this locality, and one that offers oppor
tunity of material profit to the railroad
company, is that of the Santa CruÂ»
Lime Company, which seeks to tap the
San Vicente grant. Immense quantities,
of bituminous rock and lime are now
hauled from here by wagons.
There is still another route that may
be taken. It would be by way of Fel
ton, leaving the narrupv-gauge road at
Boulder Creek, running by way of Ben
Lomond and over the Pescadero ridge
to the broad-gauge railroad near Red
wood' City, a distance of about seventy
four miles.

Patrolman Hines had reason for re
garding Charles Cook, who emptied the
contents of both barrels of a shotgun
into a dog, as a person of violent tem
per, who had frequently terrorized his
family by exhibition of the same, but
the wife and son of Mr. Cook declared
that the officer had been misinformed,
as a man of more amiable disposition
than the husband and father did not
exist.
The shooting- of the dog, young Mr. :
Cook averred, was an act to be com
mended rather than censured, inas
much as the animal was a family pos
sessidh and was sick nigh unto death
when the lead was poured Into It with
intent to end its suffering. If a man
had not a right to execute his own dog
in the interest of humaneneFa, for good
ness sake what liberty Is left to the in
dividual in this law-ridden city?
Mrs. Cook wept as she pleaded for
leniency at the hands of Judge Ca
baniss. If the court knew what she
knew of the sweetness and light cast
upon the Cook household by its mascu
line head the Jdea of punishing him for
pee~e disturbance and discharging fire
arms within the municipal limits would
appear absurd, not to say ridiculous.
Besides, she and several young children
were dependent for maintenance upon
Mr. Cook's breadwinning capacity, and
If he were sent to Jail the family alÂ«o
would suffer.
The wife's plea won, as such pleas
nearly always do, and Mr. Cook was
set at liberty to return to his home at
1947 Stockton street and resume his vo
cation of peddling coffee. Patrolman
Hines, however, adhered with obstinacy
to his belief that Mr. Cook was a very
ill-tempered man.
Judge Fritz discovered that R. H.
Merret, accused of supplying hia
3-year-old son with cigarettes, could
not be convicted under the law pro
hibiting the giving of tobacco to
minors, so a charge of cruelty to a
minor child was substituted and will
be tried to-day. With the prosecution
rests the task of proving by expert
medical testimony that cigarette smok
ing is injurious to the physical health
of little boys, and the defense may
also that spiritual teachers be
summoned to show how the moral
well-being of youth is affected by the
fumes of "coffin nails."

The Japanese ships which have

a building here filled with stores- sup
posed to be medical supplies.
The British steamship Heathbank,

HARBIN, April 19,-r-There was a
determined attempt on the night of
April 17 to cut the railroad between
Harbin and Vladivostok, a formidable
body of Chinese bandits making an
attack near the station of Imyanpo,
100 miles east of Harbin. After a
fight which lasted several hours the
bandits were driven oft and dispersed.
The vigor of the skirmishes taking
place on the east flank of the Russian
array seems to indicate that the Jap
anese are planning to thrust north
eastward, to interpose a force between
Harbin and Vladivostok.

Death of the Assassin to Occur With

ST. PETERSBURG, April 19. â The

who was sentenced to death for the
assassination of Grand Duke Sergius,
that a state of civil war existed in
Russia and that he was a prisoner of
war and not an ordinary prisoner ac
cused of a crime, is considered here

Kaleieff, having been tried by a spe

"Morning or afternoon?" inquired
the court.
"Brass," replied the officer.
"Well, sixty days' imprisonment is

reason why It should not be applied in
cases where the plunder Is brazen.

TURKEY'S REFORMS MEET
SUCCESS IN MACEDONIA
Financial Scheme Said to Be Achiev-
ing Good Results at
Present.
VIENNA. April 19.â The negotiations
between the power* regarding Great
Britain's plans for the financial reform
of Macedonia will probably be ter
minated at the end of April. Borne
doubt is entertained here about Ger
many's attitude on the subject.
The Neve Freie Presse publishes an
interview with Herr yon Mueller, the
Austrian agent in Macedonia, charged
with carrying out the Austro-Russlan
reform programme, who passed through
Salonica recently on his way to Athens,
in which he declares among other
things that since March 1 the financial
reforms in Macedonia established by
Turkey through Hilmi Pasha have
been working very well, all the officials
and other officers receiving their sala
ries promptly through the Ottoman
Bank. He expresses the opinion that
this system will have the most suc
cessful results.
The Foreign Office here does not deny
statements to the effect that Herr yon
Mueller will not return to Macedonia.

Figures Given by Dr. B. Laquer at

Statement.
WIESBADEN, April 19.â "Americans
are shorter-lived than Germans," was
the conclusion reached by Dr. B. La
quer in his paper on "Social Hygiene in
the United States," submitted to-day to
the International Congress of Medicine,
now in session here. "Although more
temperate in the use of alcohol than the
Germans and working an average of 10
per cent shorter hours, the Americans
are," said Dr. Laquer, "exhausted
earlier in life."
The doctor gave figures for each
thousand of the population. The num
ber of persons from 40 to 60 years old
are in Germany 179, in America 170;
persons over 60, in Germany 78, in
America 65. Dr. Laquer did not under
take to explain the facts. He simply
gave them as the result of inquiries
which he made during a visit to the
United States in 1904.

VOTES AND CHILDREN.
Tongresi of Women, in session in Washington, criticized
President Roosevelt for his position on race suicide. It was
believe*! that the President had only called attention to a mat*
hat has been observed by sociologists here and in Europe. The
I teems to be to hold the family up to numbers, in our pres
dit state of civilization. Unless this is done it will be found that
h civilization and ihe perpetuation of the race are incompatible.
It was a significant thing, thought to be worthy of an extended
iated Press news dispatch, that Mrs. Harriman, wife of the
-ident of the Southern Pacific Railway, had abandoned a con
ipiated trip to Europe in order^o stay home and take care of her
baby. It is a worthy example. It teaches duty to the mothers who
c their infants in the care of a nurse while they either go abroad
plunge into social campaigns. The care of infants is a duty of
- m every station of lite, and if that duty be shirked the
sequences finally fall upon the state itself.
\<< one pretends that the decline of the birth rate in this country
- become acute. The President did not say so. but he recognrzed
subject as worthy the attention of statesmen, and spoke in the
ICC of warning. He is not fairly subject to the attacks made upon
B in the Women's Congress. The leader in the criticism was Miss
Anna Shaw, who said: "It is said that women should rear more
ldreHi but I say you must first make your country fit to rear chil
li in. We need to make this world safe for children. To do so
hen social heredity, so thai they will be born in safe
conditions ami protected until grown. This cannot be done until
women have rights in the Mate to protect them. We must have city
â¦hers as well as city fathers. We desire suffrage as a means to an

babies. There is no situation, in city or country, in which conditions
can be made so "safe" that parents can omit oversight of their young.
notation is in the world, impinged upon life, and ceases only
when life ends. If there is any place except the home, and any con
on external thereto, in which children can be nurtured in self
:al and self-control, making them resistant to temptation, it is
discovered country. Surely it is not found in the woman suffrage
â¢es. diving women the ballot in Wyoming, I 'tab. Idaho and Colo
rado has not supplied any safer conditions in those States than are
found where the tyrant man does all the voting and ballot-box
B*f and office holding. rVs far as observation can prove facts, j
â¢nan suffrage has not made any impression at all upon public
calf <">r mamvers. We do not say that it has degraded either, but |
'hat it has not promoted them.
Miss Shaw's assumption is that men feel no interest and have
â  -â¢ risibility in the matter <>i erecting: moral safeguards for the
Lection of the voting, We fear that the lady forgets that her father
- a man. It is the normal State ol families for fathers to feel
their joint responsibility with mothers for the welfare of
Iren. The wlmlo matter seems to be quite distinct from the right
itirage. If the two were joined the woman suffrage States would
crowded with child-rearing parents, fleeing as to the sanctuary
\ the safe conditions of which Miss Shaw speaks. But this is
ihe case* The hand that intermits rocking the cradle to cast a
Hoi in those States seems 10 have done no more to make the
intry fit for children than the hand thaf rocks the cradle only and
leaver the ballot to the male partner.
Mis< Anna i- riding a hobby, and it is running away with her,
hi teeth, and bead down. She is not the representative of the
â¢herhood of the country. We have mentioned the good example
Kei by Mrs. Harriman. That lady is a representative mother and
She abides by her sacred duty to her baby, and finds no
â  â¢ a foreign tour or for girding at President Roosevelt. The
iers in American homes, 90 per cent of them, are keenly alive to
-lability, and so are the mothers. It is impossible for
conditions unsafe for children, morally or physically, to long prevail
where, because women and men are at one in duty and solicitude
their children. To sa\ that this condition is not present and is
waiting for woman suffrage is to deny that humanity has high in-
Minctv that are manifested by the beasts that perish. A tigress will
Food her young, and we presume that even Miss Shaw has seen
â  gander hiss and fight for the safety of the goslings. Fathers and
:hers were before empires and states. The home existed before
<al organization, and children were there, the pride even of the
troglodyte.
We think it would have been better for the country if the
W ongress had treated the President in a kindlier spirit than
'Mng at him about his "set." as was done. He has six children in
the White House and has made it, in its domestic aspect, a typical
American home. His children attend the public schools in Wash
ington and ask no odds and get none because their father is President.
c of the pleasant sights of Washington is these children at play in
the back lot of the White House, where they make mud pies, do
great jobs of teaming in their toy express wagons and get dirty,
hungry and happy, like natural children should. The President did
not speak for any "set,"' nor omit any. He is at home in all, and
learns from all and teaches all, the simple duties of life.
THE COMING SEA FIGHT.
ATTENTION is strained toward the Eastern waters, where the
Russian and Japanese fleets are feeling for each other. The
Russian admiral is fairly under observation, and what is known
-bout the position of his ships is pieced out by speculation. He could
never have felt his way so far except by straining French neutrality
to the point where a Japanese protest has become necessary. But
even this touching French jurisdiction has given occasional glimpses
I f him. Xo doubt Japanese are in all the ports he has made and are
in o*her positions from which they can report to their Government.
But it is not possible for Russian spies to spot Togo. So far as the
world's knowledge of his position is concerned he might as well be
sailing the skies as the seas.
The number of ships available in the fleet of Rojestvensky is
known. Bat the number in Togo's is left to speculation. He may
outnumber the Russian or be outnumbered. No one knows. This
mystery adds to the interest of the situation. Since Salarais no sea
fight has been of such import as that which is impending. It may
occur so far out on deep water that the world will know nothing of
it until the victor sights land somewhere. It is possible for the
fleets to entirely disable each other and for the great ships to sink
into a common grave. The fate of nations has before this depended
<n a battle on the water, but no such battle was ever approached
through such a veil of mystery.
Japan has a naval history. Russia has none, but is about to
â¢r.ske a history for her navy, either for or against the prestige of the
empire. The strain cannot continue much longer. The fleets must
be in touch very soon, and the soul of old Neptune will revel in the
fight that ever took place in his dominion.

MEN AND SPRING HOUSECLEANING
Do Not Ridicule, but Encourage Your Wives to Make Some Change
in the Domestic Scenery.
A WORD to you men who growl
while your wives, sisters, cousins
and aunts revel in the Joys of
spring: housecleaning. I don't
mean just plain, ordinary houseclean
ing, with its necessary "accompaniment
of curtain washing, carpet beating
and the like.
Most of you are sufficiently phil
osophical to accept that as an Inev
itable evil and you make the best of
eueh little inconveniences as slipping
on a bar of soap left by careless
Bridget in the hall and taking your
meals at a restaurant for a day or
two.
What I really refer to is the sort of
house renovation that means a virtual
; transformation of the domestio land
' scape â the sort which somehow
seems to have become necessary to
the modern woman, with her restless
craving for change and diversion.
Of course, you men don't under
stand it. The generic hatred your sex
feels for anything like a change in the
domestic scenery precludes the possi
bility of your comprehending woman's
oppose tendency.
The average man could go comfort
ably and happily on his way year in
and year out with never a desire to
â  see one article of furniture in his
home taken from its accustomed
place. In fact, he would strenuously
object to seeing his surroundings al
tered. He wants his desk to remain
in the old familiar corner forever if
need be, and his easy chair ditto. He
Las â  fixed place whereon to keep his
pipe or other smoking things and
there he insists they shall stay.
And so he fails altogether to under
; stand why a woman finds it necessary
for her peace of mind, to change the
position of every article of furniture

ish and unnecessary following of a
mere feminine whim. He condemns
the woman's craving for .change as
a sort of mania which should be dis
couraged.
And ft is right here that my coun
sel to the husband comes In. You
should remember, sir, that a woman's
life, which is largely spent between
four walls, needs variety. Spring
housecleaning, in affording a woman
this opportunity to alter her surround
ings, is a boon and a blessing to her.

in beaten grooves, and of woman's ex
istence this is particularly true. It
is frequently remarked that women
crave change more than men. They
need it more than do men.
You men who spend so little of your
time at home and who have so many
more opportunities for diversion and
change of scene than your wives â
think what it must be to look day af
ter day upon the same domestic scen
ery! Any woman who Is compelled to
pass much time at home grows tired
of seeing the same pictures hanging
in the same place and the same ar
rangement of bric-a-brac morning,
noon and night.
To a woman her home is her world
and when the fact of that world re
mains the same year in and year out
the effect is deadly in Its monotony.
Merely transforming the fittings of a
room may act as a mental tonic â a
suggestion that diverts the mind from
well worn ruts into fresh channels of
interest. Monotony means a low rate
of mental and spiritual vibration.
So do not ridicule your wife when
the fever for change seizes her. En
courage her to satisfy the craving â
and incidentally be thankful if she
does not demand a more expensive
change of scene.

AN ODD EPITAPH.
"Franklin's epitaph, where he com
pared himself to an old book, is known
to all of us." said an antiquartaji to a
Philadelphia Bulletin man. "Here is a
copy of a less famous epitaph, the epi
taph of a watchmaker, GÂ«orge Rltter,
who compared himself to a watch that
had run down."
The man took out his notebook.
"George Ritter." he said, 'lived In
New Hampshire, in the town of New
port- He died in 1822."
Then he read:
"Here lies, in horizontal position, the
outside case of George Ritter, whose
abiding place in that line was an honor
to his profession. Integrity was his
mainspring and prudence the regulator
of all the actions of his life. Humane,
generous and liberal, his hand never
stopped till he had relieved distress. He
never went wrong, except when set
a-golng by people who did not know
his key. Even then he was easily set
right again. He had the art of dispens
ing of his time so well that his hours
glided by in one continual round of
pleasure and delight, till an unlucky
minute put an end to his existence. He
departed this life September 11. 1522.
His case rests and molders and decays
beneath the sod, but his good works
will never die."

FADELESS FLOWERSâ A Reader.
City. Botanists look upon the immor

they suffer little change, in appearance

succeeded In adding to the list of fade
less flowers.

ers Declare What They
Will Require in Budget
ASKS MORE PATROLMEN
Dntaa Wishes Provi-
I>e Made for 200
Extra 31eml>ers of Force
The Fire Commissioners and the Po
lice Commissioners laid before the Fi
nance Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday statements of the
estimated amounts needed by their
departments for the coming fiscal year.
The Fire Department wants $1,034,310
and the Police Department $941,680.
Many radical improvements were
s.sked for by both commissions. Chief
Dinan reported that the last census en
titles the Police Department to 200 more
patrolmen, two extra captains and
ofJicers in proportion, as provided
for in the charter. The Fire Commis
sioners ask lor four more engines of
xuodern type and new quarters.
Both aepartraents complain bitterly
ci their horses. Fire Commissioner
Finn declared that less than half erf
"the horses in his department are fit for
service. Commissioner Reagan said
that there is scarcely a horse in the Po
lice Department that will pass muster.
He declared also that several of the
patrol v.-agons are on the verge of
ehaking^to pieces.
The r inance Committee agreed with
tliÂ«- Fire Commissioners that new en
gine houses were needed to replace the
cntiquated structures*, on Main street
find Post street. The former, Super-
Visor BrandenFtein declared, is abso
lutely unfit for habitation.
Chief Sullivan wants two new-engines
es pjon at possible, one for the House
<or Correction Tract, the other for Pa
cific Heights. The department, he as
serts, has an inadequate supply of hose i
Â«m hand. Where it should have 10,000
feet, here is less than 4000 feet. avail-!
able in case of emergency.
The complaint was made that the
lund for paying substitutes for injured
fireijien had bern exhausted and that ;
eoveral men who had been injured in
the line of duty were obliged to work. |
though not fit for duty. â 
Chief Dinan advanced the point that j
there were ten men doing duty as de- j
tecttre sergeants for patrolmen's pay,
$100. whereas they did the work of ser- I
geants. He believed that they should :
receive thf pay that the work called i
for, f l.^O a month.
It wa? found that there are two more l;
lieutenants in the Police Department :
than were provided for in last year's '
budget. It was explained by Commis
sioner Drinkhouse that these appoint- j
ments were made by Chief Wittman. j
The funds of the department were large
enougji to warrant the appointments.
<jeorge D. Shad burn representing
the St. Mary's Pask Association, asked
that provision be made in the budget j
for $25,Â«X)0, which would be enough to â¢
complete the plan of the association

Violation of Fire Ordinance Gives

DOORS OF DOLORES
TO SWING OPEN
Worshipers to Gather To-day
in Ancierit Sanctuary.
FLORAL TREASURES FOR THE ALTAR
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
San Francisco does love its old Mis
sion, after all.
It rose up yesterday and proclaimed
It aloud, and with its declarations of
love are wiped out many years of
apathy and neglect.
Tc-day the doors of the old sanctuary
will be flung open, and the blessed
eucharliu will be borne in reverence to
the altar, the same old altar reared by
Indian hands in the long ago.
Here will it rest through the day, en
shrined in a bower of blossoms, and as
Pt old, the worshipers will come to
kneel before the beautiful shrine, even
as did ihe neophytes in the days of
Francisco Palou. the founder.
Among the worshipers will come de
scendants of thf Noes, the Bernals, the
Valemias and the Ruffinos â they who
in the days before the gringo came
owned the lands for leagues about the
old mission. Hut all Is lost now â even
the old Ruffino adobe goes down before
the Ju*rg<Â»rnaut of Pragresa.
All is iost now of the old days, the
days when the land was young, and
greed and haste and envy knew no
placeâ all save the old mission and its
memories.
To-day hundreds of people will visit
the old sanctuary, whose founding is
coincident with the birth of the United
Siau-s, choosing the day of prayer for
the visit, because its doon will be
swung wide open to-day, and all who
will may enter.
That San Franciscans are awake to
the value, esthetic, religious and ethi
cai. of the old missionâ and that they
believe its doors should be open each
day to the people is shown by the fol
lowing excerpts from interviews:
i"HARI.ES WARRKN STOIJDARD â Mission
Dolores not open to the people.? Why, I am
BMSsssa.
Dolores, the pathetic and patient mother of
San Franciscoâ I thank God that the lived
to see the bouncing baby all through its
trouble Now that San Francisco has grown
up. ay should Its little shrine, sacred to
her sweet memory, be closed?
STODJ>AKD\S TENDER MKMORY.,
If 1 had the risht I would ask every goo#
Catholic â and every good CaUfornian â i.
little in the box that we may forever keep
this blessed fhrine^ â the place â where I knelt
as a child â the cradle for every Catholic child
that is yet to come.
DR. WH-MAM RADER -As a citizen of
San Frand.Â«eo 1 am naturally Interested in
die Mission Dolores, and should be glad to
ccc it open ts the public. Unquestionably it
it the chief historical structure In the city.
I must confess that I have never bÂ»en within
thÂ« ola churvh; having tried once and failing, I
never tried again.
The tourists from other parts of the world
who come here. Catholic and Protestant alike,
should. I think, have the privilege of looking:
in upon & mission in which San Francisco
was cradled.
The attitude taken by 'Father Brennan
toward the vandalism of recent years is, of
courÂ»Â«. quite natural and necessary, but I am
sure he will lend hts I'o-operatlon to thÂ« LÂ»a.n<l
rr.arks League in their endeavor to provide a
caretaker to look after the mission, on the one
hand, and the people on the other.
FRANK J. SULLIVAN â I read your story
In The Call this morning, and. while deploring
thÂ« fact that the splendid old sanctuary is
now closed to the public, believe, that Father
Brennan will readily agree to open the doors
of his beloved church when assurances are
given him that it will be safeguarded.
And to demonstrate my earnestness toward
its faferuardtng. I will subscribe $100 toward
It. That ie the type of enthusiasm that tells.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 20, 1903,
CHARLES SEEQIDWICH AlKENâ Mission
Dolores is the only historic structure In San
Francisco â holding a story of romance and his
tory that is of thrilling interest, not only to us
Call form ans, but to every tourist that comes to
our city. Therefore I think some plan should
be adopted whereby the church may be openâ
under proper supervision, of course.
Ac proof of the popularity of the old mis
sions when the Sunset Magatine carries a
Mission story between its covers the demand
for tbe issue is doubled.
JOHN J. LHRMENâ With the rapid growth
of our city the value -of land has increased so
that the old has, of necessity, given way to
the new; sentiment has been almost lost, and
to-day there are left In our city but few
landmarks of any historic value. In time
even these will pass away â all except one â
old Mission Dolores. It ia and will be the
one connecting link between the past and
present, a reminder te the visitor that San
Francisco was buildÂ«d on the rock of Chris
tianity and nurtured in the cradle of sentiment
and romance. Boston has Its old South Church.
New York Its Trinity and San HVancisco should
ever have its Mission Dolores. By all means
keep the church open. Keep Its doors open
and let the vVsitor ever be welcome.
HELP FATHER BRENNAN.
But by all means help Father Brennan. Its
pastor, to do â good Father, Brennan. whom
1 have known since childhood, ; and - who I
ki.ow will gladly ; co-operate with | us .of the
Landmark League if we can make it possible
for him to do so. ; . And when â  all our old
landmarks shall have passed , away there will
then be left to us one monument of a time
and* a life we shall never see = again. . Like
the roses in its churchyard. Mission â  Dolores
will. Â« as it were, give forth a perfume - rem
iniscent of the purity and simplicity of Its
founders and sweet [ with the memories of an
unselfishness whose object was the savins
of souls rather than the making of dollars.
RUFUS P. JENNINGSâ I have | heard - the
lament of thousands of tourists who have vis
ited every mission in the State and on going
out to Mission Dolores were dented admission.
This matter, however, can be easily adjusted
co the people who are really interested can
enter the old sanctuary at will. '
FRANK H. POWERSâ Eve* since the de
oU>ion of The Hague tribunal that the Pious
fund should be paid to the church, I have felt
certain that the broad-mindedness of the. Arch
bishop and bishops having In charge the fund
would do everything possible toward carry
ing out the original idea at the time of ths
creation of the Pious fund; that is, to make
the mission* available to the. general public.
The strength of Mr. McEnerney's argument
h<"-. re The Hague tribunal was that this Pious
fund was given essentially for the purpose
of making the missions available as a means
of bringing the. people living near the mis
sions to the Catholic faith, and that therefore.
It was inequitable for the Mexican Govern
ment to use the money for any other purpose.
Therefore I feel that the. opening of the MlÂ»-
Mon Dolores as a means of creating public in
terest in the missions' work Is the first prao
tlcal Ftep toward renewing: Interest In the ob-
JfCts of those benevolent Spaniards who
created the Pious fund.
These missions are to us what the ancient
ruins are, to Greece, the Pyramids to Egypt
and the cathedrals to Italy.
Thus is it seen that San Franciscans
do love their old Mission â that they
love it for its memories and for the
things that it stands for.
To-day, through the kindly offices of
Mr?. Henry P. Gleeson and a corps of
friends, the old church will be beautiful
tn look upon, the conservatory of the
Golden Gate Park having been levied
upon for its treasures.
Among its visitors to-day will be
Chark-s Warren Stoddard, the famous
writer and deep lover of the missions,
whom I shall have the honor of ac
< ompanying into the church of his
childhood.
What memories it will awaken, after
fifty years of absence!

and will notify the proper authorities
of any discrepancies in the weight of
butter packages coming within the
law.
â¢ It was resolved that a standard one
pound square of butter shall be of
the dimensions of I&x3 inches and of
length sufficient to contain one pound.
Copies of the resolutions are to be
sent to the Humboldt County Cream
ery Exchange, the Creamery Oper

WILL INSPECT
GREIF'S OFFICE
Grand Jury Is to Have the
Books of County Clerk
Examined by an Expert
ANDREWS THREATENED
Told Publications Will Be
Launched to Assail Him.
Pretty Woman Asks Loan
A committee from the Grand Jury
will investigate the County Clerk's office
to-day. The Jurors will take an ex
pert with them and a rigid examina
tion of the books will be made.
Numerous attempts are being made
to intimidate Andrews. Some of the
tricks resorted to are novel, to say the
least. Some seem purposeless. A few
days ago a young woman, petite and
pretty, went to the office of the Grand
Jury. She was in trouble, she said,
and understood that Mr. Andrews
sometimes made loans. Would he lend
her some money on her jewels? She
was told that Andrews was not in the
loan business and left, after shedding
a few tears of disappointment. A
Grand Jury detective followed her and
found that she had been sent by some
one who was Interested in trapping the
arch enemy of graft.
Andrews was given to understand
lately that if he did not "quit" a paper
would be got out for the purpose
of "knocking" him. He smiled when
asked about this and other alleged
threats. "Yes," he admitted, "at
tempts have been made to intimidate
me. Some of them were rather inge
nious. But nothing: can .call me off
from the work I have started to do."
Three grand. Jurors, Andrews, Speok
and Bryan, visited the Broadway jail
yesterday in company with Dr. Rot
tanzi. They pronounced the old struc
ture outrageously unsanitary. "It 1b
unfit for human habitationâ the place
is reeking with filth," declared the
foreman. The Grand Jury will rec
ommend that the jail be condemned.
The same committee visited branch
county jails 1 and 2 and the Magda
lene Asylum. All of these places were
found to be In a sanitary condition.

DEATH THREAT
STOPS SUICIDE
Robert Young Loses His De
sire to Die When Spe
cial's Pistol Covers Him
FIGHT IN LUMBER PILE
Watchman Fired Upon hy
Man Who Wishes to Blow
Out His Brains in Peace
"Stop killing yourself, or I'll shoot
you." That threat made Robert Young
.abandon an attempt on his own life
yesterday. Young was holding a pistol
to his head and was about to pull the
trigger when Special Policeman H. M-
Stone leveled a revolver at him and or
dered him to throw up his hands.
Young dropped his pistol and surren
dered.
"I wanted to commit suicide in
peace," he explained at the City Pris
on. "I didn't want to get killed at the
same time by any one else, so I surren
dered."
Before Young made the attempt at
suicide he and the special had a short
battle in the lumber yard of the Simp
son Lumber Company, at the foot of
Powell street. Stone was going his
rounds when his dog started after some
one hidden in the lumber. Stone started
after the stranger, when a bullet
whizzed by his ear. The plucky watch
man, undaunted, kept after the fellow.
The dog got a half-Nelson on the man's
trousers and would not let go. Stone
came upon the man behind a pile of
timber.
The fellow raised his pistol to his
head just as Stone came In sight
"Quit killing yourself," ordered Stone
sharply, and Young immediately
dropped his pistol. Stone placed him
under arrest and he was taken to the
City Prison, where he was charged
with discharging firearms within the
city limits.
The stranger refused to give any
account of himself. The lumber pile
is the one that the police searched a
few days ago for Torturici.
"I wouldn't have shot if he hadn't
tried to stop me from committing sui
cide," declared Young. "Can't a man
shoot himself without being shot by
some one else?"

I Why has it lived and thrived and

Simply and surely because of its ster- â

the diseases of womankind is not be-
cause it is a stimulantâ not because it is
a palliative,'- but simply because it is
the most wonderful tonic and recon-

curing disease and displacements and
restoring health and vigor.

new athletic field. The first contract
was let to-day and it calls for the

Burglars Frightened Away.
While patrolling his beat on Lyon
street at an early hour yesterday
morning a policeman found the front
door of F. Franklin's store open. It
was evident that a I rglar had been
at work about the place in search of
military clothing, as a quantity of
Government articles were strewn on
the floor. Franklin says that he lost
over $96 worth of goods. It is thought
that the arrival of the patrolman was
observed by a lookout and the alarm
gsven in time to make the escape.
The noise made by some person try
ing to open the front door of J. Rob
erts' home at 1451 Leavenworth street
at an early hour yesterday morning
caused Mrs. Roberts to make an in
vestigation. Thinking it might be her
husband returning from a trip to the
interior, rhe asked who was at the
door. The intruder thereupon took to
flight. Mrs. Roberts was armed with
a revolver.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 20, 1905.
Three Bases and Two Hits
Allow Four Runs to
Come In.
Seals Fail to Tap Dr. Moski
man Safely Till the Sixth
Spasm.
Uncle ceased to be a leairue head
liner after the Commuters had fin
ished with his tribe yesterday at Rec
reation Park. The first inning was
the turning point of the game, the
time it broke up for keeps. It all
happened so quickly that neither the
Seals nor the fans realized what was
coming off till Oakland had the game
stowed away. Score, Oakland, 6;
San Francisco. 1.
No one seemed to care what hap
pened after the first inning had been
reeled off. All the fight had left the
Seals and all the interest the fans had
saved up seemed to take wings at the
sound of the resounding wallops. The
game dragged along after that for an
hour and fifty minutes, everybody
wishing it would hurry up and end.
Roscoe Miller went in to pitch un
der protest. He had a bad arm and
realized he could not do himself jus
tice. But as the team is crippled and
broken up and his services were bad
ly needed. Miller got into action and,
of course, fared badly.
He managed to get rid of Van Hal
tren and Francks, the first two men
up, but then his wing became kinky
and he passed Kruger, Dunleavy and
Streib. Kelly waded into a fast one,
shooting it out to deep right field and
chasing Kruger and Dunleavy
through. Devereaux next responded
with a drive to left. This time Kelly
and Streib arrived, giving the Com
muters four to start with â a safe lead
for any man's ball team.
Moskiman held the Indian sign over
the heads of the Seals for five in
nings. Not one of them could get a
hit, try as he might. In the sixth
Wheeler, Miller and Spencer bingled
one after the other. The big wallop,
however, was lacking. Wheeler arriv
ing on Walters' force of Spencer at the
second sack.
Waldron arrived in time to get into
the game. He played good ball and
the fans extended the glad mitt of
welcome. Danny Shea cut his leg in
sliding to the plate and will be out of
the game for several days. The home
team, as It stands, is in a bad way. It
seems the Commuters will go right
down the line this series. The score:

DR. LEGGO RIGHT MEDICINE
FOR THE HANDICAP.
9 â 
Honiton Finishes Fair Second to the
Spanking Three-Year Â»Old.
FATHER CATCHEM BEATS F. W. BARR
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Dr. Leggo performed another skill
ful operation before the assembled
students of form, bookmakers, specta
tors, trainers and rubbers at Oakland
track yesterday. The remarkable
three-year-old picked up 111 pounds in
the $1000 mile and a furlong handicap
to 116 pounds on Honiton, and disposed
of the crack mare like breaking sticks
at the finish. The track was heavy,
which augured in favor of the Doctor,
causing the layers to install him fa
vorite. Probably of the other starters
Bombardier received the most consist
ent backing, due to the heavy condi
tion of the track. He cut little figure
in the race.
"Big Bill" Knapp apparently had
orders to go out in front w,ith Honiton,
and he lost no time in carrying the
same into effect. Tooman astride
Dr. Leggo dropped in behind the
bunch, until the far turn was reached.
Then tramping around the field, he
soon had Knapp riding the leader.
The mare tried hard to retain her po
sition, but it was useless, the favorite
passing her at will, and scoring by less
than a length, with something in re
serve. Show honors were captured by
StiHcho, a 16 to 1 outsider.
Favorites held their own by captur
ing three events. There were no start
ling surprises and the books could not
have laid away much.
Jimmy Coffey's Evea G looked far
and away the class of the starters ln
the introductory mile and fifty yard
selling run. Her odds were played
down from 7 to 6 to even money, and
Frank Sullivan landed the mare a
clever winner over Modicum and Red
mont. Lady Kent failed to display
any speed.
Mr. Farnum, from the McCafferty
â rtable, takes an occasional turn at the
bat. and the mile and three-eigrhths
selling number was his. Played from
6to 4 1 iÂ», Tommy Taylor shot the geld
ing to the front, and at the wire he
led the favorite, Ir.victus, out a neck.
Had Sullivan kept the latter horse up
closer to the leaders the first mile his
mount could not have lost. Bozeman.
on Expedient, finished in the show.
C. Stubenbord Jr.'s Candleblack colt
Father Catchein had all the luck in
the two-year-old scramble, winning in
buck jumping fashion. He was second
choice to F. W. Barr, and ran home
three lengths before the latter, easing
up. La Charta, from the Baldwin
stable, finished a close third.
But for hie shaky underpinning the
Beven-furlong selling affair would have
been honey from the comb for Warte
Nicfat The Wilkerson entry, with
Tooman in the saddle, received heavy
backing at scant odds and then finished
third in a three-neck nnish with Matt
Hogan and Yellowstone. The winner,
Matt Hogan. went to the post a C to

EsecUl Dispatch to TIM Can.
LOXDOX. April 19.â Donald Rows,
general European representative of
the Illinois Central Railroad Company,
has Just returned from a trip to Aus
tria and Italy, where he met the Gov
ernment authorities regarding the pos
sible diversion of Italian and Austrian
settlers in the United States from the
Eastern to the Southern States. Rose
does not represent his railroad ln this
matter, but the Governors of the
States of Louisiana and Alabama.
The Italian Government has Just re
ceived the report of a commissioner,
who has made a personal visit of In
vestigation into the Southern State*
for the purpose of reporting upon the
welfare of some forty settlements of
Italians who have been in America
for some years. The report is gener
ally favorable to the Italians and goes
into the condition of the South for
Italian labor and with few exceptions
advises that Italians can do better by
going on the land in the Southern
States than into the Eastern States aa
miners and laborers. The theory is
that the Italian in the South becomes
a permanent land owner, â while the
tendency for the Italian in the North
is to return to Italy.
The Governors of several of the
Southern States, it is stated here, will
carry on a propaganda of education
respecting their neighborhoods, with
a view to Inviting this class of labor
to compete with the negro tabor of the
South.

That Their Prisoner Is Pletro

The police have as yet found no sat
isfactory clew to the whereabouts of
Pietro Torturicl, accused of the mur
der of Biaggio Vllardo. No definite
information has been received con
cerning the -suspect held by the au
thorities at Havre, Mont. The fol
lowing dispatch was received from
that place last night: â "â¢* V^s^
A faded portrait of a woman found se
creted in the clothes of Michael Korea, the
Italian held hÂ«rÂ« on suspicion of being PiÂ«tr.>
Torturicl. adds to the belief of the local
authorities that they have the right man. The
portrait resembles closely the printed pictures
of the fugitive's wife. Rosa, fought for Its
possession when the officers attempted to take
,It from him. It will be forwarded to -thÂ»
police at San Francisco, together with a de
scription of the prisoner. --
Rosa was taken to Fort Benton. thÂ« county
seat, to-day, where ha wilt be held In the
County Jail. Whether or not RosÂ«a lÂ» th*
right man. he is a mystery to the officers. He
still keeps his silence.
By order of Chief of Police Dinan
the two Italians, Dominic Rosario and
Phillip Fertitta. who were arrested on
suspicion of having some connection
with the Vilardo murder, were re
leased from custody yesterday. . As no
evidence could be found against the
two men other than the fact that they
were acquaintances of the murdered
man. Chief Dlnan did not think fur
ther detention was Justifiable.
Captain Burnett sent Detective Sil
vey with an interpreter to ask Mrs.
Rosa Torturicl if she would Hi to
take an airing with her baby in Ports

She started to go, but when the ele

SAFE BREAKERS
WORK IN STORE
Expert Cracksmen Drill Open
the Door of Safe and Take
Several Hundred Dollars
WOB-K IS UNFINISHED
West, Elliott & Gordon Are
the Victims of Thieves
Who Know the Location
Expert cracksmen opened the safe
of West, Elliott ft Gordon on Sixth
street Tuesday night and got about
$200 in currency. They left their job
unfinished, not attempting to open
the burg-lar proof door of the cash
box. which contained $1200 in gold.
Entrance to the store was gained
from a door in the vestibule of the
Hillsdale lodging-house, which is in
the same building. The door led to the
basement and the crooks broke the
partition which separated the two cel
lars, showing that the men were thor
oughly familiar with the premises.
They want up the back stairs and
broke i* the door of the room where
the safe is kept.
A hole about three-eighths of an
inch was drilled through the outer
door, which destroyed the combina
tion, and after that it was easy to opei>
the door. The currency was taken
from a pigeon hole, no attempt being
made to open the burglar proof part
of the safe.
The safe is located in the rear of
the store and it would have bpen im
possible for any one from the outside
to detect the burglars while they were
operating. The police are at a loss to
know the reason why they did not at
tempt to get the money box. It is not
believed they were frightened oft. as
a clothes broom shows that the men
carefully brushed themselves off after
finishing their job.
The robbery was discovered by one
of the employes when he opened up
the store in the morning. Papers
were strewn about the floor and an in
vestigation showed at once that the
safe had been tampered with. Detec
tive Ryan has been placed on the
case.
TENNIS HONORS
FOR CALIFORNIA
The annual intercollegiate tennis
matches postponed from last Saturday
were completed in the Berkeley courts
yesterday. As was expected, Califor
nia carried off the honors, winning all
three matches. This makes the fifth
consecutive year In which California
has shut out her opponent at tennis.
Although the doubles were won by
Berkeley in straight sets, the match
was by no means one-sided. The score
was 7-5, 6-4. The contestants were
George Hodge and John Cassell of
Stanford and Claude Wayne and RÂ»b
ert Variel of California. Wayne and
Variel played a steady game and
pioved just a trifle tou strong for Cas
sell and Hodge. Cassell gave his part
ner excellent support and played a sur
prisingly good game considering his
lack of experience.
The second singles match, the first of
which was won by Neil Baker last Sat
urday, also resulted in a victory for the
California representative. The set
played yesterday went to Baker by a
score of 6-3, making the complete score
in his favor. 6-0, 6-3.
The handicap doubles tournament for
the Olds cups, played on park
courts yesterday, was completed down
to the finals. The successful teams were
Mlsg Lulu Wegener and Mrs. C. Wat
son (owe 15 1-6) and Miss Dorothy
Weed and Miss Sarita Van Vllet (1-6).
These two teams will meet to-day.
Miss Van Vliet and Miss Weed first
beat Miss I. Mearns and Miss Vera
Crocker (owe 1-6) and then disposed of
Miss Bessie Cully and Miss A. Green
berg (3-6).
Mrs. Wegener and Mrs. Watson had
to win only one match to reach the
finals. They drew in the first round,
where they beat Miss A. Vodden and
Miss G. Myra (owe (3-6). The latter
previously won from Miss V. Beyfuss
and Miss E. Hess (4-6) by default.

DENY PERMIT
FOR BLASTING
Supervisors Eule in Favor
of the Preservation of Tele
graph Hill for All Time
PRIVILEGE IS KEYOKED
Outdoor Art League Files
Protest Against the De
struction of the Landmark
The Supervisors" Street Committee
yesterday reported adversely to the
petition of the Globe Grain and Mill
ing Company to explode blasts in
Chestnut street, between Montgomery
and Kearny, for the purpose of grad
ing Chestnut street to official grade.
Property-owners on Telegraph Hill
and a number of ladies from the Cali
fornia Club, North Beach Improve
ment Club and the Outdoor Art League
were present to voice their protests
against the destruction of the hill. R-
C. Sims, attorney for the protestants,
said the blasting on Telegraph Hill
had been a source of annoyance for
many years and his clients wanted the
matter settled for all time.
W. Kelleher, president of the com
pany, stated that all he wanted was
the privilege to grade its property,
as the grading is necessary for the
protection of its plant from falling
rock and to enable it to secure en
trance by teams on Kearny street to
its property. Kelleher said the plant
represented an investment of $350,000
and the company desired to erect a
warehouse on part of its land.
The committee told Kelleher that
the previous permits granted to his
company only called for grading its
lot and for the building of a spur
track, but it was not contemplated
that Telegraph Hill should be blasted,
as permits for such operations had
been repeatedly denied. Kelleher said
that the rock was being removed by
Gray Bros, and he did not think that
his company should give up any of its
property to hold up a street that is
far above grade. Kelleher said that
it would take a year to cut away
twenty feet from the cliff.
Charles Bundschu spoke against
the granting of a blasting permit and
urged the city to buy the necessary
land for the preservation of Tele
graph Hill.
Dr. Dorothea Moore of the Califor
nia Club urged the Supervisors to re
tain control of the hill and not permit
its destruction. Dr. Moore asserted
that Gray Bros, did not come before
the board with clean hands and the
ladies are afraid of the firm. Mmes.
Fassett, Atkinson and Dittel urged the
preservation of the hill from an
esthetic standpoint.
Supervisor Rock's motion that the
application to blast be denied pre
vailed. The committee also repeated
Its recommendation requesting the
City Attorney to bring injunction pro
ceedings to prevent further blasting
on Telegraph Hill.
Supervisor Braunhart's motion that
a resolution passed in 1903 granting
the company the right to blast on its
own property for grading purposes be
revoked also prevailed. Braunhart
said that the permit was being used
as a subterfuge by Gray Bros, to
establish a rock quarry, which was in
violation of an existing ordinance.
The committee expressed Jtself In
favor of purchasing property at the
edge of the hill for 160 feet to be used
in beautifying the hill. The Finance
Committee will be asked to appro
priate the amount required in the next
budget.
The protesting ladies appeared on
the same mission before the Board of
Public Works, which at once adopted
a resolution revoking the permit grant
ed to the company to blast on Chest
nut street. Aigeltinger said he would
introduce a resolution revoking a simi
lar permit to Wetmore Bros.
The committee took under advise
ment the petition of Rosenberg Bros.
to build a spur track on Japan atreet,
between Townsend and Brannan. Ob
jection was again raised to the spur
track by property-owners on the
ground that it would endanger the
lives of children who live on Japan
street and destroy the street for resi
dence purposes.
ENDS HER LIFE.
OAKLAND, April 19. â "While In
sane from brooding over the death of
her baby and her sister, Mrs. Eva
Fisher, 27 years old. committed sui
cide to-night by drinking carbolic acid
at her residence. 1519^ Market street.
Mrs. Fisher had been despondent for
months and made several threats to
end her own life. Last night she
soaked sulphur matches in water and
drank the solution, but her life was
saved by prompt medical treatment.
This evening the melancholy woman
got a bottle that contained a solution
of the poison that had been used as
a disinfectant. She drank five ounces
of the fluid and died before a physi
cian could be of assistance. It was
nine months ago that Mrs. Fisher's
child died. Mm. Fisher leaves a hus
band, Fred Fisher, and her mother,
Mrs. M. Capp, who resides at the
Fisher home.

Tha New York wires of E. V. Hutton & Co.
yesterday said:
COTTONâ There has been some free selling
of May cotton on the theory that the large
amount of low-grade cotton so much talked
of for delivery would depress the market this
morning but as noticed In the past spot in
tcreets have bean best buyers of thfr option,
therefore thÂ« cotton which will be tendered,
If any. -will -no doubt be taken care of Friday.
tbe 28th. which will be notice day for the
May delivery. We expect a quiet and narrow
market for tha next few days, pending the
Easter holiday.
COFFEE â It was generally expected this
morning that the local market would show
considerable heaviness at thÂ« opening at a
result of weakness shown by foreign markets;
instead.- however, it showed a marked degree
of strength on very good buying, which de
veloped Immediately after the opetlng. A
considerable amount of May was bought by
a leading coffee interest which ha: been con
spicuous for Its hedging- operations of late.

NEW YORK. April 19.â Speculative senti
ment on the Stock Exchange turned again on
technical market conditions rather than on
intrinsic conditions of values and the new*
bearing on them. There was . another flutter
among speculative traders In stocks caused by
the renewed clump In Northern Securities on
the curb. That stock did not touch yester
day's low price, however and its downward.
course was effectually checked and a sub^
stantial recovery effected with corresponding
effect or. the market for stocks within the
Stock Exchange. The implication drawn from
the .movement had to do largely with the
market position of the large speculation com
mitted to the. high prices for the stocks, but
the causes for their advances have been purely
within the realm of rumor and a great deal
of doubt and apprehension of the reliability
of these rumors is Induced by the feverish
dowsw&rd plunges In the stocks. The Im
penetrable mystery which has been maintained
regarding the great project* said to be in
contemplation in the . railroads leads its in
fluence to eudden fears us well as buoyant
hopa* and *<- m. sudden reversal from extrÂ«raÂ»
confidence to full rejection of all flying re
pcirts. This was eeen In the tendency of
the current stock market rumoj-s to-facw about
from faith In the wholesale harmony In thÂ«
cotr<Â£>eting railroad Interests to fears of a re
r.ewed outbreak of all the old hostility of
the period before the Northern Securities
formation. For Instance, doubts were urged â 
of the legal right of Union Pacific to hold
Northern . Pacific or Great Northern . stock.
which would come to It as the proceeds of
the Northern Securities dissolution. The opin
â irm of the .Supreme Court, pronounced inci
dentally in the Northern Securities decision.
that the turning- ox - er of control of the North
Â«^rr Pacific to the Cnion Pacific would con
travene 1 the Sherman law was cited as au- <
thorlty for this view. Alleged Intention to pre
.elude minority representation from the di
rectorate of â¢ the two railroads was also dis
cussed, with the suggestions of a spirit of
hostility rather than harmony prevailing in
the railroad worid. The 60-called "mystery
<=tocks" in the market, suffered most acutely
from the liquidation, â  at rallied effectively on
the late renewal of harmony reports. There
v.ere no Â«lea!Uigs in Northern Pacific, but
ncmir.al quotations were made for the storks
"when relezesd'.' and the bid and asked prices
ttnjs me<3e fhowed tmm price-range well sus
tained near the recent high level. Great
Northern preferred sold down 17% and rallied
Bk This relieved some apprehension that tha
FtockÃ were likely to â¢lump when the re
distribution replenished the supply In the mar
ket. It was evident also that many of th*
brokers and commission houses which . were
the largest sellers during the heavy declin* ;
yesterday were busy buying to recover their
holding*. The persistency of this demand
helped to restore confidence and develop
strength In the Utter part of thÂ« day. The
Â«Â£Â»rresslv<=. rU*? In the Southern group aroused
6cm<> new conjectures of important financing
project*. The promise of a record April ton.
na*e of enthraclte helped the coalers. Amal
gamated Copper moved up in conjunction with
the speculative rumors regarding to-morroWs
dividend meeting. Reports of the receipt at
very heavy orders strengthened American Ix>
comotr**. United States Steel : preferred re
rponded on the recovery to confidence In con.
tfiUons in â  v nt trade. Reports that the stock
tax till was not to become ; a law of tha
Bute wer* mad* effective upon sentiment.
The traders who fought the rally by selling
stocks short were forced to cover at the last
end made the closing the strongest of the day.
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, par
value. $3.41Q.0C0.
Uelted States bonds wera all unchanged on

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, April IÂ».â Weakness in wheat de
veloped in the last half of the session, the
sentiment being quite bearish. At the opening
the market was influenced by higher prices
in Liverpool. July opened a shade higher at
65(&88%c. May was >4c lower to 14c higher
at f1 15 to $1 15' - For a time July was in
good demand from influential traders, but of
ferings were light. The result was a moderate
advance, the price riftng to 88%@88%c before
the end of the first half hour. Scattered buy-
Ing of May sent the price of that option to
$1 15% c.
Reports of frost last night In various sec
tions of the wheat belt had a strengthening
influence on the market early in the day.
Later the market became decidedly weak.
Coincident with the ulump there was heavy
liquidation in the May option. It was said
In the pit that a bull clique was endeavoring
to dispose of a part of the clique holdings. A
factor decidedly instrumental in causing the
decline was a series of dispatches Indicating
favorable progrr-gs in the development of win
ter wheat. Predictions of rain followed by
warmer weather in the southwest gave addi
tional encouragement to the bears.
An unusually liberal increase in primary re- I
ceipts aided the selling - movement. Several
large commission nouses were active sellers j
of July, which as a result, declined to 87% c
Meantime May sold oft to $1 13%. . Just â  be- '
fore the clone part of the loss In July was '
regained on covering by shorts, but May con- '
tinued heavy. The market left â¢ off weak with I
May %c lower at $1 13% and July off %c at |
81 %c. â¢ * â â .-.,. V s ,
Notwithstanding the weakness of wheat the '
corn market had a comparatively firm under- â â 
tone. July closed unchanged at 47% c â .â .-â -...

"The condition of the Hay market shows but
little change â¢ from >â , the report . made a week
ago; receipts.- although less ; than last â  week,
til continue quite heavy.' the total amounting
to 2720 tons. ' The medium and poorer â  grades
make .up the *. bulk of â â â¢ shipments ; as a result
there , Is an overabundance of , cheap Hay and
prices are ruling low. I The poorest grades can
be used for nothing & but stock feed, and on
account of the plentiful supply of grass there
Is but - little demand among the stotek . and
cattle men. 'â --" :.;â '' â¢ 'â  , v â¢â¢:- '-â â¢â :.;â¢.
â¢But i very few cars of strictly fancy Hay,
either wheat and oat or tame oat. have been
offered on the market = during > the week. . Such
Hay -Is nearly always' in fair, demand and at

tained. :.V â  : ; â¢â '-: ''â  .-. 'â â ' â â â  .--;-.': 1 :
"Concerning . the new crop, . we can 'â â  simply

choice Hay put up, as In most of , the districts
contributory to the San Francisco market the
growth is very rank, promising an abundance
of coarse Hay. This . fact, together - with ; tha

; distributed, some dealers being overloaded.
especially with Eggs, and others carrying mod
i crate stocks. Taking the market* as a whole,
i however, the supply was large. A car of Bjt

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Fresh arrivals of Strawberries were light
owing to the recent rain in the growing dis
tricts, only 142 chests being received, and
choice offerings sold well, while off lots con
tinued to frag at the inside rates. Receipts
of Cherries consisted of 70 drawers of the
Purple Gulgne and common white varieties.
The Guignee were well colored and found
ready sale, while the whites sold slowly, being
bmall and generally unattractive. The Orange
market was firm under continued light re
ceipts and prices of all grades of Navels were
higher, both . in the open market and In the
auction rooms. The small sizes were still
favored by buyers and brought the best pricea.
Five carloads were auctioned as follows:

Dried Fruits, Nuts, Raisins, Honey. |
A sudden sensation was sprung on the Dried i
1 Fruit trade yesterday. Up to ten days ago it !
was thought that the Prune crop this year ,
I would be a record-breaker, but within the last j
j day or two Armsby & Co. have received re- |
ports from their correspondents in Santa Clara. |
': Sonoma, Yolo and Solano counties, and also In ;
i the , San Joaquin â¢ Valley, -â  that a remarkable 1
( change has taken place, during, the past weak. â¢
! and j that I the Prunes are â  dropping . by whole- |
â sale, and that from current estimates the crop !
â  will not , turn , out over 50 per cent at - best. ;
' and in a large number of districts not over 25 >
i per cent -of an average yield. Some districts '
report only 10 per cent. , While various -reasons <
, are given for the drop, the. one most generally I
' accepted Is that the frequent late rains have

CHARGES WOMAN
WITH BRIBERY
A scandal that was brewing in the
Police Department last December, but
was not brought to a finality owing to
The removal of H. W. Hutton from the
office of Police Commissioner, was re
vived yesterday by the application of
Policeman J. S. P. Dean for a warrant
for the arrest of Marie Paris on a
charge of bribery. Dean informed War
rant and Bond Cierk Fitzpatrick that
or. the night of December 14 the wom
an, who occupied a house In Bacon
place, had given him a bribe of $3 to
put false entri^o in his notebook.
Dean was at the time assigned to the
Wockade at Bacon place, with instruc
tions to take the names of all visitors.
He had been put there at the request
of Hutton with the object of discover
ing if the hnmaiei- bribed the poliegmen
on the blockade. The patrolmen were
changed each night, and Dean had with
him as a companion on the night of
December 14 Policeman Samuel Hig
gins. Hutton appeared upon the scene
according to an arrangement with
Dean, and Dean informed him that
Marie Paris, one of the women, had
given him a bribe of $3, and he turned
the coin over to Hutton.
Hutton then made a demand upon
Higgine for any bribe money the of
ficer had taken. Hi^gins denied that
he had received any coin from any of
the women and defied Hutton to prove
anything to the contrary. It was Hut
ton's intention to keep up the espion
age . but he was removed from office.
Dean did not get his warrant yester
day because doubts were expressed as
to whether a charge^of bribery could
eland in view of U& fact that the
blockade of Bacon place was an au
thorized act. The District Attorney
â will be consulted, and Dean was asked
to return to-day.
Arrested on an Old Warrant.
Henry Chassagne was booked at the
City Prison yesterday by Detective
Bell on a charge of grand larceny. He
was- arrested on a warrant issued in
May. 1903. by Police Judge Cabaniss.
The complaining witness-- was Sidney
A. Lord, an insurance agent living at
21 Eleventh street. Chassagne had
been employed by Lord as a stablf
mar a.nd to do odd jobs about the
house. It was alleged that he disap
peared, taking with him clothing and
s*wlry belonging to Lord of the value
of $SOO. Chassagne went to Nevada
and did not return till a few days ago.
He is a son of Leon Chassagrne, whole
sale liquor merchant, 482 Jackson
street.

SMITH SHOWS
UGLY TEMPER
Joseph Smith, the aged contractor, on
trial before a jury in Judge Lawlor's
court on the charge of shooting and
killing Joseph E. McGowan at 2969 Mis
sion street on November 26, showed
flashes of temper during his severe
cross-examination yesterday by Dis
trict Attorney Byington. At one time
he said he would like to see the Dis
trict Attorney get what he deserved.
"What is that?" asked Byington, and
the defendant viciously replied:
"As good a beating as I got on No
vember 26."
Byington desired to question the de
fendant as to the statement he made
to Captain Burnett shortly after his
arrest to test his condition of mind, as
he had denied knowing anything about
making the statement. An objection
was offered by the defendant's counsel,
and after considerable argument the
Judge^sustained the objection.
The defendant admitted that his true
name was Joseph Brannlgan, and when
asked why he had changed it to Smith
he replied, "1 hated the name of Bran
nigan." He denied that there was any
other reason. He admitted that he had
women carousing with him after his
wife's death. He also admitted that he
had quarreled with young McGowan
and wae afraid of him. He stuck to his
story that he had no recollection of
shooting McGowan.
Several men who had had business
dealings with the defendant for many
years, and others who knew him inti
mately, was called to testify as to his
character and drinking habits. They
all said that he drank more heavily
after his wife's death than before.
The case will probably close this aft
ernoon. This morning Eddie Graney
and De Witt C. Van Court will be called
as experts on the effect of a blow on
the chin.
Child Labor Law in Effect.
The child labor law passed by the
last Legislature becomes operative to
day and the School Superintendent's
office was kept busy yesterday issuing
certificates to employers of children
between the ages of 14 and 16 years.
Under the law children under %16% 16 will
not be allowed to work unless by spe
cial dispensation of the Juvenile
Court.

WAR TO OUST
THE GRAFTERS
Non-Partisan Clubs Will
Probably Join Hands With
the Republican League
FALSE REPORTS ABROAD
Committee on Organization
Will 3ieet Next {Saturday
to Name District Workers
Cunning politicians of grafting pro- [
clivities are endeavoring to create the i
impression that the San Francisco Re- |
publican League is hostile to the Re- j
publican County Committee. False re- !
ports concerning the league's commit
tee on organiaztion have been circu- j
lated to excite displeasure in the gov
erning body of the party. The per
manent chairman of the league, George
D. Clark, has made no announcement
of the appointment or selection of sub
committees on organization in the sev
eral Assembly districts, and nothing
has taken place to indicate a design
upon the part of the league to ignore
any citizen who is ready to give his
services to the cause of better govern
ment in San Francisco.
The league's committee, consisting of
George D. Clark, Daniel A. Ryan, John
D. Daly, David Rich, E. J. Bowes, John
Lachmann, Fairfax H. Wheelan, Rich
ard J. Welch and James A. Wilson,
will meet next Saturday and may be
able at that time to name the sub-com
mittee of ten for each Assembly dis
trict. Rooms for permanent headquar
ters have not been engaged, but several
committeemen favor the selection of
quarters in the new Flood building, on
Market, Powell and Ellis streets.
Vigorous efforts will be put forward
in every district to bring about a large
registration of voters and an active
participation in the primary election on
the second Tuesday of August. It is
believed that improvement clubs and
independent organizations that have
been advocating a non-partisan move
ment to expel the grafters from* the
City Hall will see their way clear to
follow the San Francisco Republican
League.
The Noe Valley Civic Club of the
Thirty-fourth Assembly District held a
meeting last Tuesday night" and adopt
ed the following resolution:
Whereas. The NoÂ« VaJley Clvie Club of tha
Thirty-fourth Assembly District considers the
political welfare of San Francisco to be of
more importance than the success of any
political party ajid believes the pnesent un
desirable conditions in the municipal govern
ment are due in a large part to party loyalty
In the past; and
Whereae, The purpose of the municipal gov
ernment of San Francisco should be to secura
to its citizens the beet streets, sewerage,
schools, hospitals, libraries, fire and police pro
tection, that are possible to be obtained from
the city revenues and the bond issues honestly
collected and expended in accordance with thf
letter and spirit of the city charter; and
Whereas. Differences in party theories are
in no way related to these desirable conditions,
and blind adherence to party prejudices pre
clude the possibility of their realisation; there
fore, be It
Resolved. That the purpose of this organiza
tion shall be to strive, by non-paxtisan action,
to place before the people of San Francisco
candidates for the offices to be filled at the
coming municipal election, nominated by a
non-partisan convention, who shall represent
as nearly as possible the ideals of honesty,
capacity and fearlessness and entire freedom
from the domination by any class, corporate,
capitalistic or organised employed; and to that
end we will co-operate with kindred organiza
tions formed in the city having the same
general object.
Thomas Hughes of Los Angeles, one
of the leading Republicans of the south,

It is customary, when absolute ne
cessity compels the absence of a ve
nlreman, to oresent a valid excuse for
non-appearance to the court, but
neither Wheelan nor Sterling took the
trouble to do so. The result was that
the court decided that process should
issue compelling them to explain their
action, and an order to this effect was
issued.

ABUSES WIFE
AND BABY GIRL
Andrew Adamson, "The Dub
lin Cyclone," Arrested for
Cruelty to Infant Child
MAKES HOUÂ§E A WRECK
Drives Mother and Daughter
From Home and Then De
molishes the Furniture
Andrew Adamson is a marine fire- j
man. He is also known as the "Dublin ;
Cyclone," having received this cogno
men from the city of his birth and his
ability to go up in the air after imbib
ing freely. Adamson is languishing in
the tanks as the result of a cyclonic
spree that took place Tuesday, when he
attempted to beat his wife, and suc
ceeded in driving, her . and their one- '
year-old girl out of their home ay*6 !
Harrison avenue.
Secretary White of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
says that Adamson is in the habitj2s}of
going on prolonged sprees and during
these becomes insane. The man has
been in the detention hospital recently
for examination as to his sanity. At
that time he was seeing various kinds
of sea monsters in the throes of deli- ;
rium that took several days to dissi
pate.
Prior to his imprisonment he had '
driven his wife and their four children, '
three girls aged 7, 5 and 1 year, and one:
boy of 4, from their home. The wife
appealed to Secretary White, and when |
he called at the hospital he found
Adamson nearly rational and in a re
pentant mood. Adamson made prom
ises to swear off and agreed to sign the
pladge, and was released Tuesday noon. |
All Tuesday afternoon Adamson vis
ited all the saloons between the hos
pital and his home and arrived at the ,
latter place in a drink-maddened state.
He proceeded to beat his w4fe. but she
fled from the house, desperately clutch
ing her baby, and was taken care of by
neighbors. Adamson then proceeded to
uphold his reputation as the "Dublin
Cyclone." He twistea through the
rooms, kicking over tables, smashing
chairs and hurling crockery at the
walls and through the windows. The
racket attracted the attention of the
nearby patrolmen, who, looking through
the transom, saw Adamson in the cen
ter of the bed jumping up and down
and yelling wildly. When he emerged
from the house he was arrested by Pa- !
trolmen Mullan and Young.
Adamson made a furious resistance, "!
and that proving futile sobbingly said
that he wanted to keep his brother-in- i
law, Thomas Bell, from the house. He '
even went so far as to appeal to Secre
tary White for advice. As the result of
driving the baby from his home Adam- j
son was booked at the Southern station j
on a charge of cruelty to a minor child. |

PRUNE DEALERS
REPORT A LOSS
A. D. Porter of J. K. Armsby A Co.,
' A. Rosenberg of Rosenberg & Co. and
Mr. Blum, a packer of Vacaville. say
that the prune crop of California this
year, in all the principal districts, will
range from only one-quarter to one
! half of the usual California output.
Ten days ago the outlook,^ so these
! gentlemen say, was good for a record
' breaking prune-producing season. The
j trees were bearing enough small prunes
to give basis for high hope in this di
rection. Suddenly and sensationally a
great change has come.
, A very large percentage of the prunes j
has fallen from the trees after the fruit
had attained about the size of peas. In
the markets where prunes are sold and ;
among orchardists in California this j
announcement will cause a marked sen- â 
sat ion.
A. D. Porter has toured the Santa '
Clara Valley in the last few days and
reports on the basis of personal obser- ;
vation. He says he traveled in an j
automobile and made a general and ;
thorough inspection. He cannot see -
that there is a chance for more than j
half a crop at the outside in the valley. >
Mr. Porter is manager of the dried !
fruit interests of Armsby & Co. He was _
formerly of Porter Brothers.
Armsby & Co. have also received ad- !
vices from the San Joaquin Valley and i
the Sonoma Valley. These are of the .
same general tenor as those from the :
Santa Clara Valley.
The falling of the fruit from the trees ;
both in Sonoma and in the San Joaquin .
Valley counties has been very heavy j
and entirely destructive of the hope of |
a great California crop this year in !
these sections.
Mr. Blum reports that in Solano j
County, and also in Yolo County, the
falling of the fruit has taken away at
least one-half of the expected crop. In '
addition to making personal observa
tions, the gentlemen in charge of the 1
concerns that have been mentioned j
] also caused the sending out of skilled
' observers of crops to visit orchardists ,
! and orchard sections over a wide ;
prune-bearing area.
Various theories are given to supply
'an explanation for the phenomenon.
One is that the rains kept the flowers
wet and prevented perfect polleniaation )
and the fruit therefore fell prematurely i
to a very large extent. Another theory
is that insects have caused the damage, j
Small fruit that represented millions of !
pounds of mature prunes has fallen in
a week. The loss cannot yet well be
; estimated.
PNEUMONIA CAUSES THE
DEATH OF I. WARD EATON
Prominent Young Man Dies After
Short Illness in Nevada's Disease-
Stricken Mining Camp.
I. Ward Eaton, son of F. W. Eaton,
secretary and treasurer of the Pacific
States Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany, who resided at Redwood City,
died in Tonopah Tuesday from the
puzzling plague prevalent at the min
ing town.
Ward Eaton was engaged in the
telephone business with his father in
this city and was one of the be3t
known young men in town. He had
been in Tonopah only about three
weeks and the news of his sudden
death was a great blow to his be
reaved parents. He was taken sick
last Friday and telegrams brought hia
wife and father to his bedside, while
his mother remained -at her home and
delayed her departure because of the
favorable reports concerning the pa
tient sent from the mining camp, un
til her son suddenly took a turn for
the worse and death ended his career.
Mrs. Eaton is staying at the Luxor
in this city and is prostrated with
grief, this being the second time within
a year that death has visited the fam
ily, her youngest son having died from
consumption in Nome.
Ward Eaton leaves a wife and baby
girl.
