the "stand pat" element of the Re
publican party firmly in the saddle,
the only problem -which arises before
the Republican * State Convention
which will meet in this city to-mor
row is the nature of the platform that
will be adopted. S This has been the
subject of anxious discussion among
the party leaders assembled in this
city to-day. It is certain that the
platform will contain a plank strongly
indorsing the protective principles. It
is generally conceded that Senators
Allison and Dolli\-er, Governor Cum
mins and J. W. Blythe will be named
as delegates at large to the national
convention.

SANTA' CRUZ. May 17.â The great
work of the convention to-day fell upon
the committee on platform and resolu

shaping the policy of the convention
and determining .the manner in which
it should be called upon to settle the
question of instruction or no instruc
tion. Although the sub-committee of
the committee on platform and resolu
tions worked until 2 o'clock this morn
ing it was 11 o'clock before the report
was Â¦ ready to submit to the general
body in the ladies' parlor of the St.
George Hotel. B. D. Murphy, as chair
man of the sub-committee on platform,
then reported.
The tariff plank brought out consid
erable discussion. Many of the mem
bers wished the tariff plank to stand
pat for free trade. The matter was
brought to an issue by Thomas J.
Geary moving the adoption of the re
port as read. He took the ground that
revenue was absolutely essential to the
conduction of the Government and
that the platform as It appeared was

delegate, the fires In his bosom fueled
by the fumes of alcohol, insisted on
making a speech. Twelve times he was
ordered to his seat; thirteen times he
arose to hiccough his sentiments.

Intense silence prevailed throughout

MILWAUKEE, May 17. â The sup
porters of Edward C. Wall defeated
the adherents of W. R. Hearst in the
Democratic State convention to-day,
a resolution instructing the Wisconsin
delegates to the national convention to
vote for Wall being adopted.
The convention adopted a platform
which "recognizes the last national
platform- as the code of national
Democracy until a new platform is
adopted."
At this point the excitement of the
convention began. â¢ Coonan read the
majority resolution relating to the in
struction question and a motion was
immediately j made and seconded that
it . be adopted. Before the question
could be put, however, the minority
report, was presented. This precipi
tated the debate and for the rest of
the afternoon the spellbinders orated.
. George E. Paw of Alameda took tho
platform and opened the fight, against
the pro-instruction programme. After
paying, a tribute to the distinguished
parents of the aspiring editor, he took
up.the. editor himself and. his oft re
peated attacks upon those that sought,
as he was seeking to do, to send in
structed delegates to a national con
vention. - At this point M. F. Tarpey
Interrupted the speaker, saying:
"I want to ask a question. Did you
not get . the statements you now
make out of the newspapers? I am
sure "you did, and I want to inform
you that the newspapers are not in
fallible."
"In answer to that question," said
Faw, "I .will inform the gentleman
that the facts set forth by me are of

by Mr. Hearst to prevent instructions
for Grover Cleveland. I am reminded
that this is ancient history, but If you
want any more of it I have got it"
Tarpey remained silent and the
speaker continued:

The report of the committee on per
manent organization and order of busi
ness was next presented and adopted
without change. Adjournment until 1
o'clock was then ordered .as the com-,
mittee on platform and resolutions was
not ready to submit its report-
William Denman was placed in nom
ination by Curtis Hlllyer. but declined
to serve on account of the resolutions
against Hearst which he had intro
duced last night and which he still be
lieved the proper expression for the
Democrats of California to have made.
Shanahan moved that the secretary be
instructed to call the vote for the nom
inees as made. Contra Costa objected
as also did Kern. A vote was taken
and a division was called for. The roll
was called on the motion and resulted
in its being carried.
The district delegates to the national
convention and members of the State
Central Committee were delighted. A
vote of thanks was tendered to the
people of Santa Cruz and also to' the
officers of the convention. The latter
vote was given standing with three
cheers for Gould. Mr. Gould thanked
the convention for the thanks. He
thought enough talking had been done
and at 10:55 declared the convention
adjourned sine die.
While the secretary was compiling
the lists presented by the chairman of
each delegation, general handshaking
was indulged in by both the victors
and the vanquished. Good humor pre
vailed on all sides and harmony with
a capital H stalked through the hall.
The Solano delegation marched around
the hall with their drum beating and
banner high in the air.

Los Angeles delayed the -election of
delegates to the national convention
for over an hour while they fought
among themselves over who should go
to St. Louis. The fight was centered
on J. H. McCarthy and D. W. Edel
man. McCarthy had the best of the
game, but there was so much of a
scrap that it was decided to give each
one a half vote in the St. Louis con
vention. Shanahan of Shasta placed
the slate ticket in nomination.
DECLINATION OF DENMAN.
Tarpey moved that for the
of the deliberations of the convention
speeches be limited to five minutes
each. Districts were called to dis
cover whether they were ready to re

national convention.

Gavin McNab stated: "The success

AN EVEX-LT RESULT.
SAXTA CRUZ, May 17.â By a major
ity of nineteen votes the Democratic
State convention to-night voted to_
Bend a delegation to the Democratic
National Convention, which will as
semble In St. Louis on July 6, instruct
ed to vote first and last for William
Randolph Hearst.
Some surprising stories, which gather
around the head of John W. McDonald
of San Francisco, a member of the
City Street Improvement Company and
delegate to the convention from the
â¢ Thirty-eighth District, were told open
ly on the floor of the convention after
the vole of instruction had been taken.
Early in the afternoon Gavin McNab
confessed to a few of his advisers that
"he had direct information that McDon
ald would swing his delegation and
4hat no power could stop him. His
prediction proved correct.
When the vote on the resolution to
instruct had been anncunced the ad
herents of Hearst, led by the Los An
geles delegation, went wild. It was
â¢many minutes before order could be
.restored and this did not end the hur
rah. When the routine work that was
yet before the convention had been
disposed of, the Hearst adherents ad
journed to varicrtis places of refresh
ment end the shouts of their delight
disturbed the peace until far into the
â¢eight.
THIRTY-EIGHTH CHANGES.
"When the vote was cast for chairman
of the convention it placed Frank H.
Gould, candidate cf the anti-instruction
forces, in the chair by a majority of
twenty-two. Among those that threw
their strength to him were the solid
delegations of the Thirty-eighth and
Thirty-ninth Assembly districts of San
. Francisco.
â¢ Early this afternoon, however, the
word was whispered that the Thirty
cighth had yielded to influences and
would vote for Hearst.
The following expressions from some
cf the leaders express the sentiments
of delegates immediately following the
vote on the motion to Instruct -the
delegation: William Denman attributed !
the fall-down of the anti-Hearst men
to a tactical error on the part of the
San Francibco organization in not an
r.cuming opposition to Hearst as soon
as it had captured the primaries.
'There %vas very strong pressure
brought to bear by some of us to an
munct' boldly that we were against
Hc-aust's < andidacy as soon as we had
.captured the delegation, but we were
ova burne by pressure^ from county of
ii< eJ's. who feared to antagonize the
fKx&miaer. Kad we taken such an un

At this point Mr. Cleary returned and

convention. After a warm debate, the
minority report was adopted, thus de-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, May 17.â The night
session began with Ben B. Gels of
Glenn as the first speaker to take up
the burden in favor of the adoption of
the minority report. He was very
much In favor of the instructed dele
gates and intimated that an unin-
rell of Kern, which In reality nullified
the entire plank. The question was
discussed v.ith animation until Chair
man Cobnan put an end tcr it by saying
there must be a recess taken as the
chairs which were being used by the
committee were required in the dining
room. If the delegates wanted - any
chance to eat their lunch it would be
necessary to take a recess. In order
to facilitate matters the report was re
ferred back to the committee with In
structions to make such changes as
the discussion had suggested. ; The
committee was increased by the addi
tion of four members who wished to
have their ideas incorporated in the
, tariff plank.
It was almost 2 o'clock before the
i committee got together again, but as
; soon as they did the platform as
i amended was adopted. The next order
1 of business and the one considered the
j most vital was the report of the sub
committee on resolutions. Upon the
appeal for harmony, with the under
standing that a resolution would not
sanction instructions. William Denman
withdrew his resolution denouncing
Hearst and the committee reported for
j an absolutely free and uninstructed
delegation. This led the Hearst men
to introduce the following resolution:
"To the Democratic Convention of
the State of California: The minority
of the committee on platform and reso
j lutions hereby report and make this
amendment to the resolution reported
by the majority:
"Whereas. William Randolph Hearst,
a native son of California, is a candi
date for the Democratic nomination for
President of the United States; and.
"Whereas, William Randolph Hearst
has performed distinguished services
for the people of the United States, as
recently evidenced by his splendid bat
tle against the coal trust:
"We therefore commend the candi
dacy of W. R. Hearst to the national
convention, to assemble in St. Louis
6, 1904^ for the nomination for
President.
"We offer the following as a substi
tute:
"Resolved. That our delegates to the
national convention, to be held In St.
L.GUi3 July 6, 1904, be and they are here
by instructed to vote for William Ran
dolph Hearst for the nomination for
President of the United States, and use
all honorable means to secure his nom
ination. And we recommend Its adop
tion.
"Frank R. Wehe, for the minority of
the committee on platform and resolu
tions."
The discussion was rapid-fire work,
and as a compromise of the situation a
substitute was presented by Pemberton
of Mendocino. which became the body
of the majority report, as follows:
"Whereas, William Randolph Hearst,
a native son of California, is a candi
date for the Democratic nomination for
President of the United States: and,
"Whereas. William Randolph Hearst
has performed distinguished services
for the people of the United States, as
recently evidenced by his splendid bat
tle against the coal trust:
"We therefore commend the candi
dacy of William R. Hearst to the na
tional convention, to assemble in St.
Louis July 6. 1904. for the nomination
for President."
Â¦"During 1 the consideration of the resoj
lutions to Indorse and the compromise
offered by Pemberton of Mendocino by
the committee on resolutions there was .
considerable display of temper, and
Judge Coonan had to repeatedly warn
the members not to indulge in person
alities. Geary made a strong speech in
opposition to instructions and wound
up by saying: "If It is a fight you want.
we will fight, and fight you to the end."
Shanahan took exception to several
of Geary's statements and made ft
strong plea for the Instructions resoln
tion.
At the close of his remarks Geary
corrected Shanahan's idea that Sonoma
County had sent an instructed dele
gation to the convention by saying that
Sonoma County had sent an instruct
ed delegation with instructions not to
accept any Instructions nor to sup
port any instructions for any partic
ular candidate. At that point in the
proceedings Tarpey Interrupted by
saying:
"I would like to ask Mr. Geary if
the delegation to the convention from
Bonoma County was elected by the
people or -whether they were not simply
picked out by the County Central Com
mittee and sent as delegates to the con
vention?"
There were cries around the parlor
to "Cut it out!" "What's the user'
and "That Is all side Issue."
Geary stood his ground when order
was restored -and stated he would
answer the question propounded by
Tarpey. He said:
"The Democrats of Sonoma, County
can conduct their own affairs without
any orders from you. We of the So
noma Democracy are responsible to
the Democrats of our county and not
to you. We do sometimes elect a
Congressman in our district, and that^
is more than you do in yours."
Denman of San Francisco said the
people of California revered the father
and mother of Hearst. \ but they had
not given to William Randolph Hearst
a unanimous indorsement of his can
didacy, and it was certain that the
convention had placed its disapproval
of Hearst and his methods.
1 Tarpey took the floor* and said he
had personally talked the matter over
with Hearst and he had told him that
if the people of California would In
â¢ dorse him he would highly appreciate
the honor, but he would like to have
an instructed delegation. Tarpey
pleaded for instruction, and wound n&
. hi3 remarks with the statement that
the decision of the convention woul4
â¢ be acceptable to the Hearst leader*.
Pemberton of Mendocino replied in
I a strong speech to Tarpey's remarks,
i and said that if the majority of the.
Â¦ delegates expressed their heartfelt feel
Â¦ Ings regarding W. R. Hearst it' would
: be anything but complimentary to
> Hearst. There are a number who
I bitterly oppose him for hla attempt

an opinion denying a motion to set
aside the estate of Dr. J. G. Neal for
Samuel Neal, his son. The latter re
sides with his mother, Candace A.
Blackwell, in "San Francisco. The
court declares it was established that
the child was undoubtedly that of Dr.

WASHINGTON, May 17. â The
Weekly Crop Bulletin, published by
the Weather Bureau! says:
"Wheat is now heading as far north
as the southern portions of Kansas
and Missouri and harvest has begun
in Southern Texas. On the North Pa
cific Coast the bulk of the crop is in
promising condition, and while a fair
crop is indicated in California the
outlook in most States is not as good
as in earlier weeks. In Washington
spring wheat has suffered from cold,
but the outlook In Oregon is more fa
vorable.
"The fruit outlook is generally
promising, except for peaches in the
more northerly sections. In the South

peaches is promised."

There is a big array of legal talent
in the case. D. M. Delmas and Hud
son Grant are attorneys for the pro
ponents and M. C. Chapman, E. A.
â¢Holman and B. A. Herrington for the
contestants.
SAN JOSE, May 17.â The contest of
the will of the late James Lull began
before Judge Hyland in the Superior
Court this moiÂ»ning. Lull died in this
county on November 24 last, leaving
an estate consisting of notes and
mortgages of the value of $7000. By
the terms of the will $2900 was left to"
the children of E. A. Bridseford of
Oakland. A former wife of Lull was
provided for and the rest of the es
tate was divided among several other
persons not relatives of the testator.
Mrs. Turman and Mrs. Platt, sisters of
Lull, were ignored in the will, and
they are contesting the instrument.
The- contestants allege that the will
was procured under undue influence
on the part of E. A. Bridgeford, who
was the confidential adviser and at
torney of Lull. They allege that their
brother was addicted to the use of
drugs and intoxicants and was in
capable of transacting any business.
In proof of this they state that the
father of the testator. Dr. Almon Lull,
had prior to his death created a trusf
for the benefit of James Lull, by which
the $700'0 was invested for his bene
fit. They also charge Bridgeford with
trying to Induce Lull to enter into a
scheme to have the trust set aside.
Bridgeford denies all these charges
and charges that the making of the
will as it was by the testator was be
cause the contestants were unkind
and lacking in sisterly regard for their
brother.
Lull was convicted in this city a
few years ago of forging checks and
sent to San Quentin. He had also
been in prison before for the same of
fense.

Hatchet Wielder Pays for Assum
ing That President Roosevelt
Uses Tobacco.
WASHINGTON, May 17. â Carrie
Nation lost {50 as the result of a be
lief too positively expressed that
President Roosevelt uses tobacco. She
recently entered the office of the Anti-
CigaVette League in Chicago, and.
poking her umbrella through, a por
trait of the President, said:
"He's a smoker and chewer."
"The President is a nice man and
would not use tobacco," said Lucy
Page Gaston.
"If you will prove it to me I will
give the league $50," said Mrs. Na
tion.
Thereupon Miss Gaston sat down
and wrote to Secretary Loeb, who re
plied that the President did not use
the weed.
Loeb had no little satisfaction In
sending this reply, because his embar
rassment several months ago, when
Mrs. Nation made a scene in' the White
House, was still fresh in his memory.

mencement exercises in Troebel Hall
this, morning. Bishop Nichols of the
Protestant Episcopal church awarded
the diplomas to the two graduates,
Miss Anna Bella Dickie and Miss
Laura Dickson Reynolds, both of San
Mateo. Both young ladies had pre
pared original essays, which were pro
nounced by the Bishop and others as
greatly excelling the average produc
tions on such occasions.
Miss Reynolds is now hailed as a
poet. Her verses on '"The Poets Lau
reate of England" won the highest
praise.
Miss Dickie's subject was "Celebrat
ed Literary Friendships," and was
scarcely less meritorious than some of
her father's splendid efforts.

WASHINGTON, May 17.â The indlca
tio'ns now are that If George B. Cortel
you makes political promises as chair
man of the Republican National Com
mittee he will be able to pay the bulk
of them as Postmaster General if Pres
ident Roosevelt is elected. His decision
to engineer the campaign will necessi
tate the resigning of his present post as
Secretary of Commerce and Labor
within a. few weeks.
Broken In health, Henry C. P^yne is
willing to lay down the burdens of the
Postoffice Department ofter election.
This Will leave vacant the Cabinet port
folio which Cortelyou would most pre
fer as the rich reward of a successful
campaign manager. !
The Postoffice Department always
plays an important part in Presidential
campaigns. Two or three hard fights
for postmasterships have been known
to lose a State. President Roosevelt
put Payne, vice chairman of the na
tional committee, at the head of the
Postoffice Department because of its
great political importance. In addition
to this department! being one In which
Cortelyou's executive ability and grasp*
of detail are much needed for purposes
of reorganization, he would be the man
best informed of the political obliga
tions of the party. The great bulk of
these go through the Postoffice Depart
ment in the form of postmasterships.
President Roosevelt will take an ac
tive part in the direction of the cam
paign. Cortelyou will have his head
quarters In New York and will be at
all times within an hour's ride of Oy
ster Bay, where the President will
spend part of the summer.
Special Dispatch to The Call
"Resolved, That unless the men sign
an agreement before 7 a. m., May 19,
to handle any and all goods coming to
or going from all warehouses and mills,
no matter by whom hauled or deliver
ed, then the members of this associa
tion are hereby instructed to employ
all men necessary to conduct their
business.'*
It is believed in some quarte'rs that
the trouble growing out of the Holt
strike has now reached an acute stage
and that a general strike in this city
will result. Others assert that the
trouble will be settled without other
industries becoming involved.
The millers and warehousemen re
alizing that, if they were to have a
struggle with the longshoremen, it was
better to have it now tHan later on
when the new grain begins to come in,
met this morning.
The following was adopted by the
employers:
Several minor strikes occurred
through the union men refusing to
wcrrk on material delivered by the
transfer company. Yesterday the
transfer company delivered some grain
bags and twine at Lane's warehouse
and the longshoremen employed in the
warehouse struck at once.
STOCKTON, May 17.â All the union
longshoremen ' employed in local mills
and warehouses were locked out by
their employers at the close of the
day's work this evening.
The decision was arrived at at a
meeting of the local Millers' and Ware
housemen's Association held to-day.
The action grew out of the strike of
the longshoremen in the warehouse of
F. E. Lane yesterday and is the out
growth o-f the Holt strike. Early in
the strike of the employes at the Holt
factories the Stockton Transfer Com
pany I was ordered by the Merchants'
and Manufacturers' Association, of
which nearly all local employers are
members, to haul material for the Holt
company under an agreement between
the transfer company and the Holt
company existing before the strike.
The transfer company hauled for Holt
and was declared unfair by the labor
unions.
The prisoner denies that he is Pan
kuck. For several years he lived in
Wadsworth and until a few months
ago had the confidence of his neigh
bors.
RENO, Nev., May 17.â James Jack
son, a State detective of New York,
and J. W. Trevis, corresponding secre
tary of Sing Sing Prison, arrived in
Reno to-day and took charge of Joseph
Pankuck, alias Joseph Colby, who es
caped from Sing Sing nineteen years
ago. He was caught about six weeks
ago at Wadsworth by Constable Gold
ing, who, learning, that the fellow was
an escaped convict, informed the New
York authorities.
Jackson and Trevi3 are confident
that Pankuck is the man wanted, and
after procuring the necessary papers
will leave with him for the prison from
which he escaped so many years ago.
The man was convicted in New York
of an attempt to murder a relative. He
was sentenced to Sing Sing, and had
not been in the prison a month before
he escaped.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Dr. Buckley, taking the platform to
reply, made this caustic remark:
"Long experience has taught me that
the more vociferous the applause, the
less the thinking."
; 'I fhall show you that there is an
underlying sophism in everything that
has been said by the preceding speaker.
I will prove it to you out of his own
mouth." . â¢
* Dr. Buckley then read'from the pro
cw:-<lir<?;s of the General Conference of
1000, when the new constitution was
rindcr consideration, to show that Dr.
Xeely had offered for a substitute Arti
cle X section 3, which says that th<Â»
General Conference shall not do away
The feature of to-day's session was
the sensational debate between Dr.
Buckley and Dr. Xeely upon a substi
tute offered by the latter for the ju
diciary committee's report on tlie con
stitutionality of districting: the Bishops.
Immediately after the reading of the
Judiciary committee's report upon the
resolution referred to it several days
ago concerning the matter of "assign
ing general superintendents to par
ticular sections or districts for periods
of four years, with the possibility of
continuing said general superintend
ents in said district Â£gr a longer
)>eriod." Dr. Xeely offered the follow
ing- substitute and moved its adoption:
"Resolved, That, as to the assign
ment at general superintendents to
certain sections and districts in the
United States for a quadrennium, there
is nothing in the constitution of the
church to prevent the exercise of power
by the General Conference, but it is
mereley a matter of expediency to be
decided by the General Conference."
Dr. Xeely opened the debate upon
this substitute. His argument was of
mth fnrce of the usual and pointed
character that it evoked again and again
hursts of applause from the floor, which
Bishop Moore, the presiding officer, re
buked sharply under the conference
ruie which forbids demonstrations of
approval or dissent. Dr. Xeely finished
in the midst of a tremendous ovation.
A HEATED DEBATE.
The election of the eight Bishops
Â¦will begin to-morrow morning and is
expected to occupy considerable time,
according to the number of ballots
cast, before a final result it reached.
Under the rules of the conference
there are no nominations, the dele
gates beinff allowed to vote for whom
soever they wish. But they must vote
for the full number of Bishops to be
elected.
LOS ANGELES. May 17. â Action on
two important matters was taken by
the General Conference of the Method
ist Church at to-day's session. The
report of the committee on episco
pacy recommending that the confer
ence elect eisht Bishops to fill the va
cancies caused by death, resignation
and retirement during 1 ' the present
qusdreniiium, was adopted. At the
close of a heated and remarkable de
bate between Dr. James M. Buckley
und Dr. Thomas B. Neely. the two
foremost parliamentarians of the
Methodist church, the conference
adopted the report of the special ju
diciary committee, which limls that
the conference has no constitutional
authority to district the episcopacy â
that is, to substitute a diocesan for
the present itinerant form of the
residency and administration of
Bishops.

This report recommends the election

fill the places of Bishops Hurt and
Ninde, deceased; Senior Bishop Merrill,
resigned, and Bishops Andrews, . Mal
lalicu, Vincent, Foss and Walden, su
perannuated by a majority vote of the
conference last Saturday. Dr. Schell
of Indiana moved to amend the report,
substituting, six for eight. The motion
was immediately tabled. Dr. Buckley,
as chairman of the episcopacy commit
tee, stated that a considerable minority
Other speakers In favor of the sub
stitute were Senator McClellan of New
York, Dr. Bell of Ohio, Dr. Schell of
Indiana, Dr. Dickie of Michigan and
Dr. Elliott of Detroit. Opposed to the
substitute were Dr. A. B. Leonard of
New York, Judge H. L. Sibley of Ohio,
Dr. Cook of Tennessee, Dr. Smith
(chairman of the judiciary committee)
and Judge C. C. Lincoln of New York:
Judge Lincoln's argument dealt solely
with the constitutional phases of the
question and was an Incisive exposition
of the whole matter. The substitute
was then put upon its passage and was
rejected by a decisive vote. The report
of the judiciary committee was then
adopted, and the conference took up
the report from the episcopacy com
mittee. . .-;--.'
Dr. Buckleyâ I have no doubt of that,
but I can prove by the words of the
scriptures that a man ought to commit
suicide â "Judas went out and hanged
himeelf"; "Go thou and do likewise";
"That thou doest it.quickly." Here Is
the proof. There Is a square issue. I
stated that what Dr. Neely had read,
taken by itself, totally misrepresented
the views of Harris on this question.
He denies it. It is not a question of
veracity. It Is not a question of
brains; otherwise, nobody could, at
least very few, contradict Dr. Neely.
Dr. Buckley then proceeded to argue
against Dr. Neely's contentions.
SUBSTITUTE REJECTED.
Dr. Neely then read from Bishop
Harris' work on constitutional powers
of the General Conference. These ex
pressions were ; applauded and Dr.
Neely took his seat.
Dr. Buckleyâ Nothing amuses me
more than that applause. I will turn
aside to .read Harrisâfrom the book Dr.
Neely quotes.
Dr. Neelyâ Does the doctor dispute
that quotation?
Dr. Buckley â I affirm that that
quotation by Dr. Neely misrepresents
Bishop Harris* views upon this sub
ject.
Dr. Neelyâ I have read It word for
word.
Dr. Neely interrupted again and was
allowed to make his explanation.
Dr. Neelyâ I will never permit any
man to say that I am not perfectly
square In everything I say.
Dr. Buckleyâ Very good, go on.
SPEECH IS INTERRUPTED.
Bishop Mooreâ It is not.
Dr. Buckley â Very well. William L.
Harris would have risen up with great
indignation if resurrections were al
lowable in the economy of God, at
hearing his views presented as they
were this morning.
Dr. Buckleyâ Mr. President, make a
decision on this point, please; whether
square argument is a privilege ques
tion?
Dr. Buckley â Then I withdraw that
and substitute this: That whosoever
thinks that Harris' views were given as
stated by Dr. Neely would be in error.
Dr. Neely â Mr. President, a question
of privilege.
Bishop Moore â I think there is no
question of privilege at this stage.
Dr. Neelyâ The rules give me
risht when I am misrepresented to
clear up the misrepresentation.
Dr. Buckleyâ Wait until Â£ have fin
ifhed what I have to say on Harris*
views.
Dr. Neelyâ I am entitled to' be heard
now.
Dr. Iiuckley â Do you object to the
phrase "totally misrepresented?"
Dr. Neely â 1 do.
Dr. Neelyâ Mr. President, I object
"The General Conference shall not
destroy the episcopacy, neither shall it
destroy the itinerant general superin
tendency."
"This was referred to a committee of
fifteen, and Dr. Neely himself was a
member of that committee and was
heard at great lengthâ at very great
length â and every member of the com
mittee disagreed with him, except
Thomas B. Xeely. The report
was made to the conference and
Dr. Neely moved a substitute he had
had voted down in committee and the
'conference rejected by a tremendous
vote. He began in 1SS4 to try to bring
this thing to pass. He could not do it
anywhere. He tried to change the rule,
and he could not change it; and that is
the sophism that underlies his speech."
He proceeded to review the action of
previous conferences, and stated that
Dr. Neely had '.'totally misrepresented
the views of William L. Harris, as I
shall prove by reading from the
book â "
SAN* JOSE. May 17.â The first steps
for the construction of an air line elec
tric railway between San Jose and Los
G.itos were taken last night, when F.
S. Granger applied to the Town Board
of Los Gatos for a franchise. This
franchise is to run from the center of
the town along Main street to the
city limits, a mile and an eighth.
There promises to be a light between
Granger's company and the Interurban
Electric Railway for the franchise. O.
A. Hale, the president of the Inter
urban, and Jere Burke "of San Fran
cisco -wen* present at the Trustees'
meeting and asked that they be given
a chance to build the road. The Inter
uiban formerly had a franchise, but
allowed it to lapse. Granger and At
torney V. A. Scheller also were pres
ent, and a lively discussion occurred.
Oranger's application for the fran
chise will come up for action at the
meeting to' be held next Monday.
The line to be built by Granger will
be over private rights of way with
the exception of a mile and a half.
Tliese rights of way already have been
procured. The road will run along
the highway between this city and Los
Gatos. It will touch Campbell and
Union. Organization of the company
to build the road is completed and
articles of incorporation will be filed
in a few days. Next week applications
for franchises will be made to the
Board of Supervisors and the City
Council of this city. The railway will
be up to date in all respects, and will
be one of the finest on the coast. Work
will commence as soon as possible,
and it is proposed to have the line in
operation by January 1.

BORAXOLOGY
Boraxology is an "ology"
of soap and water. And,
when you stop and think
of it, there isn't anything
of so much importance to
so many people. Soap
and water ana a box of
BORAX go along with
civilization. And the high-
er up in the mental and
social scale you go, the
more soap and water and
BORAX you'll find. For
toilet, bath, laundry,
kitchen â for every cleans-
ing process of the home â Â¦

EAGER FOR A FIGHT.
Russian Troops at Liaoyang Hope to
Avenge Yalu Defeats.
Special Cable tr> The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyright. 1904. by the New York
Herald Publishing Company.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 17.â From
Liaoyang comes a telegram stating
that the Russian troops are in splen
did condition and elated at the pros
pect of a coming fight which will sup
ply an oportunity of avenging the Yalu
defeats. At night the camp is filled
with the sound of soldiers slncine. al
ternating with music of bands accom
panying the songs.
Reinforcements are constantly ar
riving. During the day the troops are
kept busy digging trenches and throw
ing up additional lines of earthworks.
Everything points to the commander
making a determined stand there, and
bitter will be the disappointment
should the rumored order of. retire
ment be given.
Captured Chunchus admit they are
in the pay of the Japanese. These ma
rauders are proving a deadly nuisance,
"sniping" away constantly at outposts
and sentinels and rising up everywhere
and disappearing.
Still no illusion exists here concern
ing the seriousness of the situation.
The grim statement is generally heard
that Russia to-day is fighting not only
for her prestige in the Far East, but
for her position among the nations of
the world and she must win at what
ever cost.
The Russians say they and not the
Japanese destroyed the railroad be
tween the Port Adams and Bantzulain
stations and also the portion destroyed
beyond Yongkow, after .successfully
withdrawing the guns and as much of
the stores as possible, the remainder
of the stores being burned.
Admiral Oukstomsky reports that
the channels leading to Port Arthur
are being sounded, from which the in
ference is drawn that the entrance i3
blocked, in spite of the emphatic as
surances to the contrary.
The Japanese are moving northward
very slowly at the rate of about five
miles a day. They are having much
trouble with their artillery, of which
they are bringing a larsre force.
The Invalid, the military organ,
says: *f
"The Chunchus, incited by Japanese
emissaries, ere harassing the right
flank of our army. It is essential that
the most drastic measures should be
taken immediately against these ma
rauders. It is evident that their move
ment on a large scale is wholly ar
ranged by our adversary and it shows
that the Japanese thoroughly under
stand the maxim that 'the end justifies
the means.' "
LEAGUE OF THE CROSS
CADETS TO HOLD DRILL
HUNDREDS OF RUSSIAN DEAD.
Japanese Still Busy Burying Slavs
Who Fell in the Yalu Battle.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SEOUL, May 16. â As a result of the
battle of the Yalu the Japanese have
buried more than 1900 Russians and
the work of interring the dead is still
unfinished. Meanwhile ill and wound
ed Russians continue to pour into the
Japanese camp, where these men who
surrender are given all possible assist
ance.
It is reported that the Japanese
have surrounded 200 Russians in a
strong position in the mountains north
of Anju. The plan is to besiege them
until their scanty provisions are ex
hausted, when they will have no alter
native but to surrender.
Japanese Agent Buying Rice.
HOUSTON, Tex., May 17.T-Options on
large supplies of rice grown in the
Louisiana and Texas rice district have
been secured by a Japanese contractor
during the past two or three weeks
and contracts aggregating shipments of
ten carloads a week have been made.
The contracts were made in the name
of San Francisco Japanese.
Japanese Landing at Kaichiau En
counters No Resistance.
IX3NDON, May IS.â The correspond
ent at Shanhaikwan of the Daily
chronicle, cabling under date of May
17. says that the Japanese troops land
rd at Kaichau both Sunday and Mon
day met with no opposition.
The Daily Telegraph's Newchwang
:â¢Â« 'i respondent, cabling under date of
May 17, says:
Â¦ The Japanese with a large fleet of
transports and warships appeared at
Kaichau yesterday morning and opened
B terrific bombardment of the shore de-
Tt :;ses, which were silenced by 4 o'clock
In the afternoon, the Russians xetreat
<::;; to Tashichao. The Japanese troops '
landed and are to-day advancing rap- !
Idly, outflanking .Tashichao and New
: hwang."
No further news has reached London
throwing light upon the appearance of
Japanese troops northeast of Mukden
ur indicating by what route they
ft ached that point so unexpectedly.
The Japanese are so successful in hid
ing their movements that it is only
possible to guess at them from the
vague indications in Russian official
dispatches.
According to the Standard's Tientsin
correspondent General Kuropatkin has

A question greatly discussed in the
London papers this morning is whether
General Kuropatkin has succeeded in
;'scprtaining that the Japanese are
Threatening his rear so near the Muk
dpn line and has been enabled to beein
.'i retreat, or whether he has decided
to fight. In any case it Is considered
that any day may bring news of a
preat battle in this district, as the
transport difficulties are believed to be
f>>* grrat as to make it almost lmpos
*5We for General Kuropatkin to effect
a rapid retirement.
RUSSIANS AGALV RETREAT.
NEWCHWANG, Monday, May 16.â In
confirmation of recent dispatches, the
Russian evacuation of this city has
been completed. Nothing remains but
the destruction of the gunboat Sivouch,
which it is expected will take place
early in the morning.
The Russian troops marched out in
perfect order. General Kondratsvitch
leaving with the last regiment.
The Japanese advance will be resisted
at Haicheng, whence the Russian forces
will fall back upon Liaoyang, where
they will make a determined stand,
with a fighting strength there available
of 70,000 men. If defeated no stop will
be made at Mukden, but the retirement
will be continued to Thieling, a town
at the head of navigation for native
craft on the Liao River, 200 miles north
of Newchwang. At the same time the
Cossack regiments will be employed in
the rear of the Japanese army of the
Yalu harassing the troops and interfer
ing with its communications..
It is not believed that the Japanese
will move into the interior until they
have thoroughly established their base
here, repeating their movement made
during the war with China.
The Russians admit the advance of
the Japanese army to a point within
fifteen miles of Haicheng, many of the
Russian wounded entering that place.
The nearest fighting expected before
the Japanese reach Newchwang will be

is not confirmed, officially, has It that
another Japanese corps is executing- a
flanking movement direct on some
point between Liaoyang and Mukden.
- 'According to the best information
there are no less than 160,000 Japan
ese in Manchuria."
PARIS. May 18. â The Journal's
Mukden correspondent says:
'â¢Important events are imminent
The outposts of the two armies are al
ready in contact in the zone north
west of Fengwangcheng. The Japan
ese army advancing on Liaoyang is
OUTPOSTS IN CONTACT.
The Japanese are now operating in
a rugged country, well suited to the
Russian defense; but north of Liao
yang to Mukden the country is a flat
plain, intersected by rivers. The
weather recently has been hot and
dry and the rain which has been fall
ing in the last two days has made the
roads almost impassable for wagons^
When the rainy season begins, at the
end of June, the plain will be convert
ed into a morass. This condition will
probably result in the practical sus
pension of operations.
Mukden is now the receiving center
for the wounded from the various. en
gagements south of the Maotien
Mountains. A hospital hag been es
tablished in the Llama Temple, in the
outskirts of yie town, and a field hos
pital has been located in a wood near
the military camp around the station.
A significant feature of the situa
tion 's the demeanor of the Chinese
population, which may be said to be
a barometer of the military weather.
A close observer of the expressions
and general attitude of the Chinese
can tell how the fighting a hundred
miles away is turning*. They have
rapid and mysterious channels of in
formation, through which the result of
the battel of- Fengwangcheng spread
and could be suspected from the out
ward manner of the Chinese before
the Russians made it known here. The
cutting off of Port/Arthur is another
instance in point.
The newspaper correspondents are.
most courteously treated by Colonel
Poestich, the officer whom Viceroy
Alexieff appointed to attend them, but
they are chafing under the restrictions
imposed here, which prevent them
seeint any thins of the fighting. Gea*
MUKDEN, May 17. â It was an
nounced here to-day that the main
body of the Japanese forces is ad
vancing on Haicheng (about ten miles
southeast of Xewchwang) and Kai
ping (Kaichou, about thirty-five miles
south of Newchwang), and that a
smaller force is marching in the di
rection of Llaoyang. Important de
velopments are probable.
. MUKDEN, May 16. â The fighting
line is steadily Hearing Mukden, where
Viceroy Alexieff's headquarters still
remain. Little reliable information
can be obtained by the newspaper
correspondents, who are forbidden to
proceed to the scene of operations, and
official information is withheld until
advices are sent to St. I'etersburg. It
is now known, however, that the Jap
anese are almost within striking dis
tance of the Russians and that the
forces protecting Liaoyang are stretch
ing eastward from the railroad along
the Maotien Mountain range.
The Japanese are advancing in
three columns and are now north of
Siuyen and Fengwangcheng. Two
columns are reported to be working
farther to the northward, with the ob.
ject of turning the Russian position
and advancing upon Mukden.
Numerous small engagements have
been fought, but no decisive action has
taken place. Port Arthur is now com
pletely isolated by the Japanese expe
dition at Polandien. , 'â¢
Large Force of Japanese Is Advancing
Toward Newchwung.
FIGHTING LINE NEARS MUKDEN.
The probability that there will be
no further communication with Port
Arthur, thus preventing Vice Admiral
Skrydloff assuming command of the
Russian squadron there, has led to the
suggestion that Skrydloff return from
the Far East and hoist his flag as
commander of the Baltic squadron,
which is destined for the Far East.
Whatever Skrydloff's future plans may
be, the Admiralty says he will cer
tainly proceed to Vladivostok and in
spect the squadron there. The report
that Vladivostok is blockaded is denied
at the Admiralty. Telegrams received
from Rear Admiral Yessen do not re
fer to the presence of a single Japanese
ship.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 17.â It is
announced to-night that Lieutenant
General Zassulitch has been relieved
of the command of the Second Siberian
army division and that Lieutenant

ECASUnCGTOK. May 17.â Father Jo
seph Murgas of Sacred Heart Church
Roman Catholic) of Wilkesbarre. Pa..
las just perfected and patented a
nireleas telegraph eystem which he
relieves to be superior to that of
ilarconl. He says it is far more
limple and messages by his sys
i'em may be sent and received at
:wice the speed. He says he has made
exhaustive experiments and has sent
Mreless messages seventy miles on
iand by an earth circuit and 700 miles
>\rr sea. The report comes from
iVilkesbarre that he has received an
sffcr to put his patent on the market
ind that he intends to devote the
money received to the church.
For the last seven years Father Mur
ras. has been working upon his inven
:ion. having established his workshop
n the. rear of the parsonage. He has
ilso es^ab]is=hed a station two miles
away from his home, and from these
:wo points messages have been sent
tnd received in all stages of the inven
;ion's development.
Father Murgas took a degree in elec
:rical eciencr in Vienna eighteen years
Â«go and has kept abreast of the devel
ppment in electricit*- ever since. His
3fn- wireless system introduces a new
method in telegraphy which may revo
'utionize the entire system. While the
Morse code of signals can be used as
Â« basis of his method, Murgas' system
Â¦will differentiate between its signals by
:ones instead of by spaces, dots and
3 ashes.
In one of the patents he has taken
?ut a telephone receiver is used for re
:eiving messages and the difference in
the characters or signals is to to be de
.â¢"rmined by the different tones heard.
It is claimed by the Inventor that this
*Â¦Â¦ ill make possible the transmission of
messages in much shorter time than by
any other system known.
The opening session of the Pacific
Coast Conference of Unitarian and
other Christian churches was held last
night in the Second Unitarian Church.
The Rev. Jay William Hudson, in a
brief address, welcomed the delegates
to the hospitalities of the Second
Church.
President Charles A. Murdock, In re
sponding, - said that he had attended
eighteen of the twenty sessions of the
conference, but that according , to a
witticism of Mr. Hudson's this twenti
eth conference was to cap the climax
and was properly held at the corner of
Twentieth and Capp streets. He hoped
that the conference would be a real
conference, so that it would be worth
while to have come all the way from
Redlands and Seattle to attend it.
DR. CRESSEY'S SERMON.
"What Liberal Christianity Asks
From the Thinking World," was the
subject of the conference sermon by
the Rev. George Croswell Cressey, D.
D., of Portland, Or. Dr. Cressey said
in part:
An orthodox divinity student who had become
a Unitarian once came to me in confidence and
eald, "I am going to my friends and tell them
of the new truth and lead them to the light I
have found." Six months later, as I expected
the young man had found prejudices too strong
and relinquished the effort to convert others
to his own way of thinking. We can't reason
ably expect to make others think exactly aa
we think, but we can expect them, to under
stand what we stand for.
A woman recently propounded this question
to me: "Is It truo that a Unitarian minister
may not utter the name of* God?" This is a
sample of the way Unltarianlsm Is not under
stood. All we wish of thinking people is to
understand what we do believe. ' and wo will
leave the rest to the subtle and secret workings
of their own mind and soul.
The practical differences between Unitarian
ism and older forms of the Christian faith arÂ«
not In the beliefs we disagree about," but in
our very nature. To define Unltarianlsm as
disbelief In the deity of Christ !s no more ade
quate than to define a republic simply as a
country which does not believe in a King.
Our first characteristic Is Intellectual in na
ture. "We do not believe with the agnostic
that religion rests on fancy, nor with the su
pernaturalist who basea religion on credulity.
We believe that religion is founded on experi
ence Just as truly as botany and astronomy
are.
On the highest and most sacred things of
life we can accept no other authority than our
own s/iuls and only our religious experienco
enables us to understand religious teaching.
There are two great dangers to Christianity
to-day. One Is a belief found In some quasi
liberal churches that religion Is only a supe
rior form of esthetics. The other is that our
beliefs in God, immortality and duty rest on
the statements of Jesus Christ or on alleged
revelation: -else we should all reasonably be
pure materialists.
THE RELIGION THAT AVAILS.
The religion that avails to-day rests not on
an alleged revelation, but finds Its evidence
in the natural world and its foundation in hu
man experience.
Unitarians hold to the religion of Jestif,
tliat practical religion Is summed up in love
to God and love to man and believe this, not
on the authority of Jesus, but because the ex
perience of the world has Indorsed It and be
cause In our own experience it has been
proved over and over.
Unltarianlsm Is not merely a protest. It is
a principle, called by the much-abused word
"liberalism," and the createst element in the
greatest thing in the world, Christian charity.
Liberalism U first intellectual, then emotional
and cbove all practical.

Kuropatk ill's Plan Meets the Oppo-
WOULD YIELD PORT ARTHUR.
PARIS. May 17.â A dispatch to the
Temps from Vienna says information
received there shows the conflict be
tween Viceroy Alexieff and General
Kuropatkin is acute. The latter at
tributes the Russian defeat on the Yalu
River to Viceroy Alexieff's orders cpun
termanding his previously given in
structions.
General Kuropatkin. according to
the Temps' dispatach, now proposes
the abandonment of Port Arthur, the
junction of its forces with his army
and the retirement of the united forces
to Harbin, maintaining that the pres
ent Russian force is not sufficient to
cope with the Japanese.
Viceroy Alexieff holds his course to
be fully as wise, as the abandonment
of Port Arthur would mean the loss
of the fleet, the suffering of a moral
defeat and the risk of the extermina
tion of the Port Arthur forces while
seeking to make a junction with Gen
eral Kuropatkin. The Emperor's en
tourage, it is added, tends to support
Viceroy Alexieff.

BELIEVES WAR WILL SPREAD.
General 3Iiles Expresses Opinion That
Other Nations Will Be- Involved.
ST. LOUIS. May 17.â General Nelson
A. Miles, who is here attending the
Good Roads Convention, to-day ex
pressed the belief that the Russo-Jap
anese war would eventually involve
other"nations.
"I believe that the war will be a
long and desperate one," said General
Miles.
Incidentally he criticized the Amer
ican cavalry by remarking that 50 per
cent of our soldiers were mounted,
while in other countries the percentage
was about 7 to 10 per cent.
"We should have more infantry and
less cavalry," he said. "
"In the next great war," continued
General Miles, "I believe the automo
bile will take the place of the horse
to a large extent. There are now
100,000 automobiles in the United
States, and the' number is increasing
rapidly. Their speed is becoming phe
nomenal. Automobiles can be used as
well as horses on bad roads."
TROOPS CHEEK EMPEROR.
Nicholas Bids Farewell to the Thirty-
First Artillery Brigade.
BELGOROD. Russia, May 17. â Em
peror Nicholas bade farewell this morn
ing to the Thirty-first Artillery Brigade,
which will leave in a few days for
Manchuria. The ceremony occurred in
the midst of scenes ef great enthu
siasm, to which solemnity was lent by
the united shout of the soldiers as they
passed before their sovereign that they
were willing to do their best for his
Majesty. The journey of the Emperor
here was in the nature of a triumphal
procession. Crowds of peasants stood
along the railroad track reverently
saluting, with the soldiers guarding the
road while the imperial. train passed.
.In anticipation of his Majesty's ar
rival Belgorod was in gala attire. An
immense crowd patiently stood from
early morning. When the train
stopped alongside the platform at 9:30
o'clock a deafening shout of welcome
arose. On alighting from the car his
Majesty was met by the Grand Duke
Sergius t Michaelovich, acting grand
master of ordnance, and then from the
crowd of brilliantly uniformed officers
on the platform stepped forth the Gov
ernor of Koursk, in which Government
Belgorod is situated, who presented his
report.
Not far away a guard of honor of
the Grivorondsk Reserve Regiment was
drawn up. The Emperor approached
the guard, saying "How do you do,
children?" to which the soldiers re
sponded stentoriously: "We wish good
health to your Majesty."
After an Inspection of the guard the
Emperor received various deputations,
from which he accepted bread and
salt. He also addressed a few words
of appreciation to the author of a mu
sical composition dedicated to the mem
ory of the commander ot the Russian
torpedo-boat destroyer Stereguschtchni,
which foundered during the naval
battle off Port Arthur on March 9. -
On leaving the railroad station the
Emperor was received with loud cheer
ing by the populace. He entered a
carriage and was driven to the monas
tery where, after a reception of the
clergy, he paid his devotions before
the miraculous ikon of St. Nicholas.
From the monastery the Emperor pro
ceeded through a double line of boys
and girls from the schools, behind
which pressed enthusiastic crowds.
The review of the troops began Im
mediately after the Emperor's arrival.
The men looked strong and fit and
satisfied his Majesty, who closely In
spected the troops, complimenting those
with whom he was particularly pleased
and receiving their responses.
After bidding good-by to the officers
and men the Emperor returned to the
railroad station amid ringing cheers
and resumed his Journey to Kharkoff.
Christian Churches Meet in
Conclave That They May
Better Know Each Other
: ST. PETERSBURG, May 18. 2 a. m.â
j Advices received by the general staff
j show that the Japanese are practically
; masters of all the southern end of the
! Llaotung peninsula save Port Arthur
and the territory commanded by Its
guns. This result, so promptly brought
about, is due to the failure of the Rus
sians to make opposition of any con
sequence to the Japanese advances.
A member of the general staff said
that the removal of the guns from the
fortifications erected at Kinchau and
the destruction of Port Dalny were
primarily for the. purpose of concen
trating the entire Russian force at
Port Arthur. If the men and guns
were scattered the effect would have
i been to distribute the means of de
! fense of the fortress over a number of
! points strategically weak. To defend
j the whole of the southern end of the
! Liaotung peninsula it would have been
! necessary to- have an army equal to
Â¦ that which' the Japanese could have
landed.
The following telegifim from General
Kuropatkin to the Emperor, under date
j of May 16. has been given out here:
'"Toward noon seventeen steamers
! approached Siungyuecheng and opened
! fire upon the town, while five vessels
' approached the shore.
â¢â¢At 1:30 p. m. three large steamers
appeared off the cape and at 3:20 p. m.
the enemy landed at Huangtsiatung
and commenced a march in the direc
tion of Kaiping."
General Sakharoff reports to the gen
eral staff, under to-day's date, as fol
! lows:
"General Samsonoff reported at 11:30
; last night that the Japanese confined
their efforts to feints at landing in the
J neighborhood of Siungyuecheng and
I Kaichau. Their vessels opened fire on
â¢ the town of Siungyuecheng, on our
j scouts and the coast.
"The Japanese squadron left after
5:30 o'clock, proceeding southwest, and
several of Its vessels remained visible
on the horizon until dark."
General Kuropatkin telegraphed to
the Emperor, under date of May 16, as
follows:
"On May 10 our Cossacks encountered
a force of the enemy composed of one
I battalion of infantry and two squad
rons of cavalry, belonging, apparently,
to the Japanese guards division, near
Kuandiansian. and the fusillade lasted
an hour and a half. The fire of the
Japanese infantry and cavalry was
poor. We had one Cossack wounded
and one horse killed and another
wounded and two Cossacks missing.
"On May 15 the Japanese vanguard
occupied Haihamentsa, in the valley of
! the Patao River; Tsiango, in the valley
of the left branch of the same river;
Shisiafutsu and Hitvouchen in the
valley of the Aho River, and Kuan
! diansian.
"There were no Japanese at Siuyen
[ on May 15.
"On May 14 the Japanese occupied
I Polandien with a detachment of two
j battalions of infantry and two squad
rons of cavalry.
"On May 14 and 15 the Japanese rec
onnaissances had not pushed beyond
I four and a half miles from the direc
i tion of Wafandien.
"On May 15 there was no advance of
any considerable force of the enemy t
the north of Polandien.
"No fresh report has been received
regarding the Japanese raid on Kai
chaii.

that the foreign correspondents shall

the indefinite future, when the Rus
sians are able to make a sweeping ad

NEW YORK, May 17. â The Inter

ship Conemaugh, which left Seattle
for New York December 13 last, has
not been heard from since February
28, when her captain telegraphed to
the New York agents that he had
touched at Caronel for coal. At the
offices of the American line it was
said to-day that they had no fears for
the safety of the vessel. They thought
it quite possible in view of > the poor
quality of coal which the captain re
ported as being all he could secure at
Caronel, that he might have been
obliged to call at some other South
American port to replenish his bunk

. SACRAMENTO, May .17. â Charles
Murray, a convict sent up from San
Francisco, escaped from Folsom
prison to-night and has not been re
captured. *
Murray was sent up for ten years
for grand larceny committed in San
Francisco. About noon 'to-day he se
cured a pair of workman's overalls
and a jumper, and, discarding his con
vict garb, put them on.
He also procured a kit of tools, and,
pretending to be a lineman in the ser
vice of the Folsom Power Company,
boldly walked up to the dam a short
distance from above the prison, in
forming the officer stationed there that
it was necessary for him to cross the
dam in order to repair some wires.
He proceeded across the structure.
This brought him into the foothills of
El Dorado County and he lost no time
in putting the prison far behind him.
It was some time before the officer
discovered that he was an escaped
prisoner and then the pursuit was en
tered upon.
At 8:30 o'clock to-night it was
learned that Murray was heading east
ward from El Dorado. The officer was
on his trpek, but up to a late hour to
night had not recaptured him.

LINCOLN, Neb., May 17. â Unless
there is a contest over a resolution
concerning railroad taxation, the Re

meets to-morrow, will be harmonious,
in addition to selecting delegates to
the national convention the conven

The nomination of a Senator is an
innovation in Nebraska State conven

TO NOMINATE A SENATOR.
As a personal opportunity the part
of Prince Karl offers Mr. Mansneld
loss chance than the solitary magnifi
cence of the role of Ivan. To compen
sate, however, there is a play Idylicaliy
charming in atmosphere, peopled with
living characters, moving through a
delightful story that holds from the
curtain's uplift to Its final fall.
The story concerns the young Prince
â¢Karl Heinrich. inhabitant of one of
. those Arcadian kingdoms that perhaps
Anthony Hope invented with "A Pris
.oner of Zenda." The Prince has been
dosed with ethics, stuffed with philoso
phy, .filled with mathematics, cur
ried, drilled, combed and other
' wise groomed into just what a little
Prince of Sachsen Karlsburg ought to
be. The opening curtain finds his lit
tle court agog with the excitement of
1 the -Prince's departure for Heidelberg.
An ancient tradition of the court it
is that the heir apparent shall spend
at feast a year in the old university
town. The Prince himself appears,
timidly hopeful, but apprehensive of
the new world* opening before him.
Very cleverly, very delightfully, is
the atmosphere of the little court set
forth, with its elaborate and deadly
ceremony, its teafightsâ at which the
youngest female Highness is sixty-five
â its petty restrictions, and its not
small splendor. Two figures, besides
that of the Prince, here stand out,
Juttner, his tutor, and Herr Lutry, the
valet, a Thackerayan gentleman's gen
tleman. Juttner for fifteen years has
taught the Prince â and not forgotten
Heidelberg. That he has "never reaily
been in the street by himself, really in
the street, you know," the Prince has
to say just as he goes off, and sets
himself thus exactly where he stands.
The next act finds the chivr actors
nt Rud-er's Inn, Heidelberg. Here
the Prince is to stay. The valet ar
rives before him, to recount to a
sympathetic footman the horrors of
the journey thither. Karl's sophisti
cation, it seems, has already begun.
Not only beer, but the plebeian frank*
furter has already been partaken of
by his orrant royalty in a crowded
waiting-room, at the instigation of
that wolf in sheep's clothing, Profes
sor Juttner. Further mischief soon
uppears. A band of students, pre
luded by barking dogs, the howling of
"Gaudeamus," and so on, rush mer
rily into Ruder's garden. The valet
decides the place unfit for his High
ness. Appears then his Highness.
The valet complains. The pro
lessor â¢ urges patience. Ruder's wif e#
and Katie â ah. Katie! â welcome the
Prince with a lovely stiff bouquet and
soitii? verse*. The students, who have
disappeared into an inner garden,
sing. Then the life, light, gayety of it
all begins to sing in the veins of the
Prince and he throws up his cap and
says, "We Etay!"
How h^ comes to be adopted by the
students into their life; how he loves
.Katie and Kalie him; how after four
months of Heidelburg he is sum
moned to Sachsen-Karlsen and has to
leave freedom, love and joy, and how,
noblesse oblige, he does this nobly,
you may best learn by going. But it
is all charming.
â¢ If Mr. Mansfield's art lacks at all in
the Impersonation of Karl it is on the
side of spontaneity. In the third act,
where he learns of the illness of 'his
uncle and the consequent necessity of
his return, the mechanism of his grief
is somewhat apparent in both gesture
and facial expression. When this is
said, however, all is said against this
brilliant and charming impersonation.
Youthful! Why Mr. Mansfield was 21
for all of us last- night!
There was poetry, an exquisite qual
ity of pathos, delightful gayety In the
characterization. One looks back with
all sorts of satisfaction. Possibly most
perfect in memory is his delightful first
scene with Katie at the innâ so ably
seconded by Miss Conquest. His at
tractive gaucherie, the monosyllabic
replies to Katie's Innocent gossip, his
growing confidence, his timid admira
tionâwith yet an ear for the artâ are
all deliriously suggested. And for t his
scene, two years later in the palace,
where the prince,, on the eve of a mar
riage of convenience, takes out his
student cap and belt, one remembers
a very lively lump ia the throat. It is
a â¢ brilliant, finished, buoyant, consid
ered art that Mr. Mansfield brings to
the part, and those missing this phase
of it will miss much. Â¦
The Katie of Miss Ida Conquest is
entirely worthy of Mr. Mansfield's
Karl. Fresh, sweet, j-prightly. daintily
humorous, she is the incarnation of at
tractive girlhood. Her pathetic scenes
' sxe distinguished also by exquisite
It was the obvious thing for Mr.
Mansfield's kind of artistâ the Mans
field that thundered a sermon on ar
tistic fitness to an astonished audience
at the Baldwin nine years ago-, when
th^y compelled him to come to life
again to receive a curtain call: â it was
the obvious thing for this actor to
place 'Â¦"'Ivan the Terrible" and "Old
Heidelberg" in conjunction. No more
cunningly devised contrast could be
imagined. On Monday night the fero
cious senility of the Russian tyrant,
last night the buoyant, charming
youthfulness of Prince Karl, opposite
poles and as fascinating in their op
position as in themselves.
The Order of Episcopal Deaconesses,
whose usefulness has proved so con
spicuous In most of the dioceses
throughout the country, is about to be
greatly extended under Bishop Nichols'
administration; The work of these holy
women in California heretofore has
been largely desultory, but an organi
zation of lay women has lately been
organized for the purpose of building a
Deaconess Home and providing head
quarters for training candidates and
pystemizing the outdoor work, which
is the peculiar duty of deaconesses.
They will not conflict with Sisters of
the Order of the Good Shepherd, which
has been represented in the diocese for
many years, and whose special duty it
is to manage such philanthropic work
as the Old Ladles' Home, St. Luke's
Hospital and among the young. Miss
Dorsey, a deaconess, will goon start
for New York for a year's training In
that city and upon her return a regular
and permanent home will be estab
lished and a large number of waiting
candidates trained for duties among
the poor. Rev. B. M. Weeden is now
chaplain of the order.
PLANS OF DEACONESSES.
The parishes of St. Mary the Vir
gin. St. Stephen's and Ocean View are
all subshoots, and other weak churches
have been generously assisted. The
latest project inaugurated is the parish
of All Saints at Masonic avenue and
Haight street, which has recently pur
chased a lot and built a sightly church
at an expense of nearly $8000. Though
the church has only been occupied a
few weeks, yet the necessity of its en
largement at an early day has become
urgent. Rev. W. E. Hayes is the act
ing curate end he has gathered around
him a body of sixty communicants and
a large Sunday-school. All Saints is
almost a self-supporting parish and
this contingency is anticipated in the
near future.
The church, which now seats 800 per
sons, will, when the improvements are
completed, have sittings for 1200.
Recently twp legacies have become
available, one of $5000, from the estate
of the late Sydney M. Smith, and one
of 52000, from the late Mrs. de Santa
Marina, which are to be expended in
the erection of a marble renedos and
altar as a memorial. Designs from the
finest artists in the country have been
received and a choice will be made as
soon as circumstances permit. Other
additions to the chancel will be made
at the time the altar improvements are
installed. The cost is estimated at
$7500. St. Luke's has always been noted
for its successful efforts at church ex
tension. Its vestry has been composed
of farslghted business men who were
not content with simply attending to
the affairs of their own parish, but the
extension of the church in new dis
tricts.
LEGACIES AVAILABLE.
St. Luke's Church, at the corner of
Van Ness avenue and Clay street, Is to
be enlarged In order to accommodate
the Increasing congregation which is
attracted by the eloquent and brilliant
sermons of its rector, the Rev. B. M.
Weeden. The lot at the rear of the
church, on Clay street, 40x134 feet, has
been bought for $8500. It is proposed
to extend the chancel of the church on
the east so as to cover the front of the
ground and erect in the rear a parish
house of size large enough to answer
for the numerous activities of the par
ish. St. Luke's, in consequence of the
rapid advance of business and popula
tion westward, is more and more be
coming convinced that it must take
upon itself the responsibilities of a
downtown church and is preparing for
that eventuality as Vapidly as possible.

GREAT ACTOR
IN CONTRAST
ST. LUKE'S SOON
TO BE ENLARGED
We favor the expansion of American commerce
and demand the removal of unnecessary discrim
ination* against our foreign commerce and the
promotion of -American shipping.
We demand strict and impartial enforcement
of all existing anti-trust laws and the enactment
of such additional laws by the Federal and State
governments as will prevent the formation of mo
nopolistic combinations and trusts which control
prices and deny equal opportunities to all dealing
with them or engaged in similar productions. We
believe the Federal. Government must assert such
control over excessive combinations of capital
Our domestic industries and enterprises should
not and need not be endangered or their efficiency
in any way impaired by such just reductions and
questions of burdens of taxation. The Democratic"
party pledges itself to a careful and fair revision
of the existing tariffs, always making due allow
ance In the adjustment of rates for all differences
In the' cost nf production between American and
foreign producers by reason of the difference of Jhe
labor cost of the respective producers.
. COMMENT ON THE TARIFF PROBLEM,
Whenever any American product subject to tar
iff taxation is offered for sale on foreign markets
at a lower price than is demanded of American
consumers the tariff of such articles should be re
duced to an extent that is necessary to render such
conditions impossible. We favor the reduction of
all unfair and excessive duties levied on articles
similar to those produced by trusts and industrial
combinations, and which permit and encourage the
creation of monopolies at home for the robbery of
the American consumer of such trust-made arti
cles.
The fact that many of the principal products of
the United States are manufactured by trusts and
monopolies, and which, protected against competi
tion by an excessive and unnecessary tax, are
shipped to foreign markets and there sold at lower
prices than prevail in the markets of the United
States, Justifies the Democratic party in demand
ing that the Dingley bill be promptly revised . and
that all unnecessary and excessive rates therein
he reduced or abolished in the interests of the
American consumer.
The Democratic party of the State of Califor
nia, in convention assembled, recognizes that as the
nation grows older new issues are born of tirne and
old issues perish; but the fundamental principles
of Democracy, advocated from Jefferson's time to
our own, will ever" remain as the best security for
the continuance of free government and against
widespread corruption, now evident in'various de
partments, the increasing aggression of the execu
tive authority in the domain of legislation, and the
growing tendency of power to gravitate into the
hands of the few, to be used for the oppression and
despoiling of the many. We demand the immediate
restitution to full power of the Democratic party,
which alike in prosperity and adversity always up
neld the rights of the great body of our people.
The primal purpose of the tariff must be the
raising of sufficient revenue to carry on the gov
ernment economically administered. As the greater
portion of the income of the Federal Government
must always be obtained by a tax levied on im
ports, and as every tax imposed on the products of
foreign countries imported into the United States
increases, by the amount of such goods as can be
sold here, thus operating to protect 'the domestic
producer to the extent of such a tax, every tax
must necessarily \be a protective one. jj
ACTION OF MONOPOLIES DENOUNCED.
We favor the election of United States Sena
tors by direct vote of the people. Recent expos
ures of corruption and fraud in the Postofflce and
Land departments of the Government are suffi
cient to justify a full investigation of all depart
ments of the general Government. Eternal watch
fulness and frequent investigation of the conduct
of public offices by the people or their represen
tatives in Congress are the best preventive of
fraud, peculation and dishonesty in public offices.
We condemn the refusal of the Republican ma
jority in the present Congress to permit a full in
vestigation of such offices for fear that the party
assistants might be found guilty of wrong-doing â
in Itself a confession of the existence of guilt
and a mischievous declaration that the welfare of
the political party and its leaders Is more to be
regarded than the maintenance of honesty and in
tegrity on the part of public servants.
We condemn the extravagance of the present
national administration and demand a reduction
of expenditures and economical management of
public affairs. With a greater sum expended by
the last Congress than ever before in the history
of our country, we point to the fact that no money
was available for the improvement of rivers, the
people's highways and the only substantial regu
lators of charges of railroad monopolies.
While recognizing that the commercial interests
of the United States .and of the world would be sub
served and greatly promoted by the construction,
control and operation of "an interoceanic ship
canal across the Central American i3thmus, af
fording a short cut-off between the ports of the
Atlantic and Pacific and those of the Orient, and
while the Democratic party of California and the
Union ever favored and advocated such a canal,
and does yet do so, we, as representatives of the
Democratic party of our State, do not approve of
the methods that have been employed by the Ad
ministration in and for the securing of a right of
way for such canal, via the Panama route. We
condemn such methods as destructive of the in
tegrity of a confederated republic. They give coun
tenance, comfort and aid to a conspiracy to dis
member a sister republic, by secession, and accom
plished in a spirit of greed and by means of armed
intimidation resulting in the despoilment of the
United States of Colombia of an important part
of its federated domain under the sanction and for
the aggrandisement of our own country.
We refuse to recognize as sound in morals the
doctrine of "international domain." under which
â¢collective civilization" demands that the United
States shall violate a solemn treaty of obliga
tions and play the role of a land buccaneer. The
Democratic party of California wants the United
States to construct, awn and operate an isthmian
canal, but wants this done without any taint or
stain of national dishonor to impair the glory of
achievement by our forfeiture of the confidence
and respect of our sister republics of South Amer
ica.
DIRECT VOTEFOR THE SENATORS.
We recognize the organization of labor to be
a distinct contribution to our growing civiliza
tion, a logical and inevitable counterpart of or
ganization in all other departments of business,
and we believe in progressive legislation looking
to shorter hours of labor, and to the enforcement
of better relations between employers and em
ployed through some rational means of arbitra
tion acceptable to popular sentiment. ~
that the evils of the trust system may.be elimi
nated without loss of advantages which accrue
from a more perfect organization of industry and
trade.
"Xine out of every ten of my people
are opposed to Hearst. They would
say if the delegates were cent to St.
Louis bound hand and foot there must
be something wrong. I am opposed to
instruction of any man."
B. D. Murphy thought the committee
was sidestepping. He said:
"The moral Indorsement of the State
would help Mr. Hearst. It will not
.jeourt if you leave instructions out.
Louis were adopted it would mean the
rupture of the Democratic party in
the State of California.
"It will be fight and we will fight to
the finish."
/ Judge Raker took the ground that
yesterday the matter of instructions
was clear cut in the fight for chair
manship.. He could not understand the
change which appeared to be apparent.
Such action could not be construed as
consistent.
T"hen the question at issue came up
before the convention.
There was one voice from San Fran
cisco yet to" be heard in denunciation of
Hearst, however, which carried at least
admiration into the camp of the oppo
sition. That was the voice of James
H. Barry. Mr. Barry was announced
as from San Francisco.
"No, sir," he said. "James H. Barry
of Tulare." Continuing, he said:
"I am here to-day; not from San
Francisco, but as a representative of
that grand county that has always cast
its vote for Democracy and never sup
ported treason. I have hear 2 that
Hearst is the grandest Democrat in
California. Go back less than two
years ago when he lent his aid to de
feat that fearless champion of right and
the people. Franklin K. Lane. They'say
that he is the greatest friend of labor
in the universe, but In answer to this I
will say that I never knew that he was
a friend '"of labor â and I have labored
long in the cause of labor â until he had
political aspirations. I know, too, that
his greatest work in the cause of labor
has beon to organize bogus labor par
ties,-led by disreputable Republicans,
whose purpose was to defeat Demo
crats. Friend of labor? Bah. It
makes me sick. A moment ago a friend
whose name I do not remember spoke
of Mr. Hearst, the gallant native son
"I" cannot, let me say to you, be ac
cused of prejudice against a native
son, for I come within an ace of being
a native son myself. Again, I am the
father of two native sons and one na
tive daughter, and I hope to be the
grandfather of many more.
"And I remember another native son,
one who was a great statesman and an
honest man, who served his constitu
ents and the nation with honor to him
self and to them: The native son was
also' California's favorite son. I refer
to Stephen M. White. And Task you
now not to forget the treatment ac
corded him by Hearst and his paper. I
shall not ask that you vote In favor of
the majority report or against the
minority report. I want to place my
self on record and say that my vote
will not be cast commending him for
any of his acts, commending him for
his career of treason."
DENUNCIATION" BY BARRY.
The speaker then proceeded and elo
quently pleaded for the cause of
Hearst. Charles Holcomb of San
Francisco and John J. Gleason. also
of the metropolis, fervently espoused
the cause of Hearst. This gave the
first intimation to the convention that
strong influences were having their ef
fect on the delegation from the city of
the Golden Gate and gave them inti
mation of what was to follow.
"I was also among those/^hat also
ran," answered the speaker, "and pre
sumed the fact was so well known that
no offense would be taken at my re
mark."
Everett I. Wood of Sacramento, tem
porarily a resident j of Tehama, by
proxy, indorsed the sentiments of the
speaker and added;, .
"They have explained satisfactorily
to themselves, at least, many things
we have wanted to know regarding Mr.
Hearst, but notwithstanding their vol
ubility 1 have failed to find an explana
tion why Hearst did not support Lane.
I was informed prior to the last guber
natorial election by Mr. Livernash; at
which time Mr. Lane was knifed by
Mr. Hearst, that if he (Livernash) had
anything to say the Examiner would
stand for Mr. Lane and the principles
of Democracy he represented and that
personal animosities would be forgot
ten in the issue at stake. I want Mr.
Hearst to do penance in California and
show that he is a true-blue Democrat.
I want him to declare by his acts In
California that he is a Democrat and
then he can go down the line unop
posed by me."
Milton K. Young of Los Angeles next
took the platform. He had not pro
ceeded far when he referred disparag
ingly to Mr. Farnsworth as among
those that "also ran." Chairman
Gould immediately called him to ac
count. "I cannot permit this vitupera
tion," said Mr. Gould, "and I shall ask
that it cease."
At this point a gentleman from the
Twenty-eighth interjected, "That's the
game. Stay with the baggage." When
the laugh had subsided Mr. Farns
worth continued and pointed out In
terms that could not be misunderstood
that he favored an adoption of the ma
jority report. Shanahan of Shasta was
next introduced. Before he could begin
hla speech, however, tne gentleman
from the Twenty-eighth again created
a howl of delight by announcing in
siren tones: "Mr. Chairman, we want
dis cut short."
Shanahan followed the suggestion,
but before he concluded his speech he
announced his doubts that Mr. Hearst
has lowered the price of ice, knocked
the bottom out of the coal market, pu
rified the waters of the country and en
riched the land of the universe.
WOOD WANTS TO KXOW.
Faw was followed by J. Aubrey
Jones of Alameda. The announcement
of Jones, who is well known to
most of the delegates, that he would
be brief, was met with wild cheers.
This led Jones to announce that
he would be the judge of the brevity
of his speech and he kept his word.
For a long period he recounted the
virtues of Hearst. He finally gave
way to E. C. Farnsworth of Visalia,
who said in part:
"This is not the first time that I have
had the pleasure of appearing before,
this great assemblage* of Democrats of
the great State of California. But to
you, now, I wish to state that the
question is this: Shall the minority
resolution or that which came from
the hands of the majority of the com
mittee on resolutions be adopted. I
appear as a humble deputy of the
Democratic party and was sent to this
convention to oppose instruction for
William R. Hearst. It has been stated
by the gentleman who preceded me
that he hoped personal considerations
would not be permitted. Let me say
this. I would do and have done what
he has not done. I will support,' no
matter who he may be, any man who
represents the Democratic party. For
twenty-five years I have been going
along the highways preaching that loy
alty to party principles is the first
desiridium of Democracy. No one has
the right to speak his heart" unless he
has a leader that stands by his guns.
JONES LAUDS HEARST.
conditions that may -j confront -them
when they arrive at the scene of the
battle. What we want is commenda
tion of Mr. Hearst, if anything, In
stead of boys' instructions. I hope
that friendship and the vitalities of the
Democracy will be stronger at the end
of this convention than before it be
gan, so 1 ask that ycm do not Insist
upon conditions that cannot and will
not be accepted by a majority of this
conventionâ I ask you to adopt tne
majority report."
! After referring to many more distin
guished California Democrats Hearst
has assailed Barry concluded.
FRANKLIX K. LANE SPEAKS.
Franklin K. Lane was called for and
was Introduced amid great enthu
siasm. He said in part:
"When I last appeared before a Dem
ocratic State Convention you thought,
as I did, that I would be Governor of
this commonwealth; would be able to
grasp me by the hand and say Cali
fornia has redeemed herself and be
come again a Democratic State. No
man has ever heard me say I had any
grudge to work out 1 o'r that defeat. I
have a choice collection of enemies and
a choice collection of friends. I do not
come here to denounce Mr. Hearst. My
Democracy is too great for that. I am
loyal to my party. The majority of the
committee has extended the hand of
good fellowship and that hand has been
spurned. If I can accent that resolu
tion, who is there among you that
should not be willing to accept It? I
ask you to decide this question as Steve
White would have decided itâ not out
of rancor, or bitterness, nor whether
you will have the support of a Demo
cratic paper In California- I stand for
a free delegation, to cast their votes as
their conscience dictates."
Thomas J. Geary was called for and
hats went into the air as he took the
platform. He said In part:
"Only one line in Alford's speech
caught my attention and that was fa
regard to the papers' support. For
eight years we have been the minor
ity party in the United States, not be
cause we have divided upon patron
age, but because we have divided on
principles. Every , Democrat thinks
there are good prospects for Demo
cratic victory, but to get it we must
have a united Democracy throughout
the land. California is not going to
settle the Presidential battle. There
are the great Eastern States, and they
met in convention and said they do
not want Hearst."
An adjournment was here taken
until 8 p. m.

128 ELLIS STREET.. We reassert our confidence In the policy of
the Republican party. Its wisdom is demonstrat

unparalleled growth and development.- We renew
and reaffirm our allegiance to the principles of the
party stated in the national platform of the Phil

broad and lasting foundation upon which Presi

the powers of the world and perpetuating a pros

We most cordially indorse the administration
of that sturdy American, President Theodore
Roosevelt. We congratulate the nation and the,
party upon the unmistakable evidences of his
coming unanimous nomination to the Presidency
and sweeping election by the people. We pledge
him the unfailing support of the people of the
State of California, happily organized for effective
work through the State League of Republican
Clubs.
GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION PRAISED.
We heartily commend and indorse the thor

Governor George C. Pardee, and rejoice in the
early fruits to the commonwealth brought forth
by his energetic and conscientious enforcement of
principles of economy and efficiency in the conduct
of the public institutions of the State. .
We commend, the energy and patriotism of
President Roosevelt and Congress In acquiring and

Republican party inaugurated the reform of the
civil service by establishing the merit system and
it will maintain and extend it as the cause of
good government may require.

IX EXCURSION TO RENO
San Joaquin County may present -a
candidate to-morrow, if the coast
counties in the district do not.
The Seventh District delegates have
agreed upon John H. Morton" and
Oscar Lawler, , both of Los Angeles.
From the Eighth District the delegates
will be D. F. Hunt of Santa Barbara
and Edward Roberts of â¢ San Ber
nardino.. This is the list as fully as it
can be given at midnight.
The Second District will send W. P.
Ilammon of Oroville and Joseph Steffs
of Sacramento. The * Third District
chose its delegates last Saturday. They
are W. L. Crooks of Benicia and G. W.
Reed of Oakland.
The Fourth District will hold its elec
tion on Friday in San Francisco. It is
believed here that the choice will fall
on M. A. Gunst and City Treasurer
John E. McDougald.
The Fifth District delegates are not
yet determined. Mitchell Phillips of
San Jose is deemed a practical cer
tainty, and Colonel George H. Plppy
of San Francisco may be second dele
gate.
The Sixth District is also somewhat
at sea regarding its delegation. Frank
H. Short of Fresno has been decided
upon, but the second place seems to be
going a-begging. Congressman J. J.
Needham of Modesto has refused the
honor, and so has C. F. Lacey of Sali
nas, both pleading a press of engage
ments that will keep them in Call,
fornia.
SACRAMENTO, May 17.â The dele
pates to the Chicago National Conven
tion are under general discussion
among the delegates to the State Con
vention this evening. The quartet of
delegates at large proposed at the San
Francisco meeting on Monday, and
consisting of Governor Pardee, Judge
J. W. McKinley of Los Angeles and
John D. Spreckels and George A.
Knight of San Francisco, seems satis
factory to a majority of the "delegates".
An element of contest, however, has
this evening been introduced into the
situation by the announcement of Sen
ator Robert N. Bulla of Los Angeles
that he was in the field for one of the
four delegates at large. Bulla said this
evening:
"I am not knifing any of the four men
named at the San Francisco meeting,
but have simply gone into the fight on
Jhe proposition that the southern part
of the State, having rolled up the .ma
jority for Pardee, is entitled to two'del
egates. If any of the other southern
counties had a candidate to run with
Judge McKinley I would step aside;
as there is none my friends have urged
me to permit the use of my name, and
now I am getting pledges of votes from
all over the State."
If Bulla is elected it will probably be
in place of Knight, as the sentiment
here seems unanimous for Spreckels.
In the First District, as announced in
to-day's Call, the delegates will choose
Charles G. Clinch of. Grass Valley and
John C. Bull Jr. of Humboldt County
as their representatives at Chicago.

CHEERS FOR ROOSEVELiT.

reading of the report by Secretary Fel

; E.t the mention of Roosevelt. Pardee
.and the Panama canal, and at its close
the resolutions were adopted unani
â¢ .tnously v.lth a great shout of approval.
Then- came the election of officers.
Senator M. L. Ward of San Diego nom
inated his erstwhile competitor, Ferd
K. Rule of Los Angeles, for president
cf the league, saying In part:
â¢ "Mr. Rule comes from the banner Re
publican county in the State. He is
a man cf fine executive, ability and
wide experience in business and poll
tics. With the approval of my friends,
Henatcr Lukens and Orin Henderson,
who. like myself, were named as can
. CJdates for the office, I nominate Rule
us a man well qualified to carry for
ward the work of our party in this
State. Our one danger Is overconfi
dence. To prevent this the Republican
clubs must work and no one can get
more cr better work out of them than
can' Ferd K. Rule."
The nomination was seconded by
Judge H. A. Melvln and others, and on
motion of Judge II. C. Dibble, the elec
â¢ tion was made by acclamation. Rule
â¢was escorted to the speaker's desk by
Senator Ward, Orin Henderscm and
"Thomas Rickard, and when the retir

SACRAMENTO. May 17.â Delegates
to the Republican State Convention,
which will meet to-morrow afternoon
'in the Assembly hall of the Capitol, are
thronging all the hotels here this even-
Ing, gathering in groups on the streets
and discussing the ways and means to
a great party victory at the polls in
November.
The convention will be one of the
most harmonious and enthusiastic ever
held in California. Success is in the
air, and the certainty of triumphing by
active, vigorous work is the word
brought from every section of the State.
The conventioÂ»"will be free from the
lively scenes that have marked, the
Democratic convention at Santa Cruz.
The absence of bitter contests and the
celerity with which the work of the
convention is sure to be dispatched has
led to some talk Qt completing the pro
gramme and adjourning by to-morrow
night, but there Is little likelihood of
this. The Congressional district con
ventions will probably consume consid
erable time In selecting delegations, to
the national convention in Chicago.
The committee on resolutions may re
quire still more. An effort is making to
secure an endorsement for Senator
Bard, and this will provoke some oppo
sition. The labor plartk in the platform
is also likely to be a bone of more or
less contention among the members of
the platform committee.
Judge A. G. Burnett of Santa Rosa
has been determined upon for chairman
of the convention, and Frank D. Ryan
of Sacramento will be secretary. Chair
man Burnett, it is said -'to-night, will
put Judge John F. Davis of Amador
County at the head of the committee
on platform.
Chairman William M. Cutter of the
Republican State Central Committee
will, call the convention to order at 2
p. m. After the reading of the call for
the convention temporary officers will
be appointed, including Burnett and
Ryan, who will later be made perma
nent" chairman and secretary, respec
tively. After Chairman Burnett shall
have appointed the committees on cre
dentials and order of business, perma
nent organization and platform, the
convention will probably adjourn until
Thursday morning.
The evening will be devoted to meet
ings of committees and of the Con
gressional district conventions. At the
same time the delegates from the sev
eral Assembly districts will select the
members of the new State Central Com
mittee, each district, or each county
where a district includes more than
one county, being entitled to one repre
sentative on the committee.

Although many, who own fine carriages and
horses preferred to watch their more pro
gressive fellow citizens from the curbstone
yesterday a goodly number of society women
yielded to the committee's urgent request and
helped to make the paracfe the beautiful suc
cess It was. The most attractive was the
Butters coach, drawn by the four prlre-wln
hits that took everything In sight at Bur
linKarne recently. Yellow snapdragons and
acacia blossoms In profusion covered the coach
and the ladles â Mrs. Butters, Mrs. Bray, Mrs.
Cook and Miss Florinne Brown â In white
drepseg and white parasols completed a very
dashing, picture. The tally-ho was not en
tered for a prize, as Mr. Butters, who handled
the ribbons, was one of the Judges. Henry
Butters is one of the few wealthy men here
who really has Oakland's best Interests at
heart and who takes an active part in every
public-spirited enterprise. -
One of the prettiest rigs was driven by Mrs.
II. V,. Mehrmann. She was accompanied by
her daughter. Miss Helen, and the Misses
Curdts. Mrs. Mehrmann. In a pale blue gown
und with her pretty blonde hair uncovered,
looked as charming and young as her sisters
and daughter in their dainty white dresses.
The whole party carried white parasols. This
outfit won first Prize in its class.
Another prize winner was Mrs. M. J. Keller.
She drove a single horse phaeton beautifully
decorated with yellow and white roses. The
carriage driven by Mrs. Sam Hubbard very
By next May, it is to be hoped, the Improve
ment of Telegraph avenue will have been ac
complished and Berkeley will be Joined to Oak
land by a broad, beautiful street. What bet
ter excuse could be had for a day of com
bined rejoicing by this city and the collide
town? There are hundreds of handsome
vehicles in Oakland,, some of the finest horses
in the State are stabled here and in no other
city are so many beautiful flowers. Why not
have a floral parade that will terminate in a
May festival in the classic shades of the uni
versity? Let the "boosters" put on their
thinking caps and give us something that is
worth while.
OAKLAND, May 17.â Santa Fe day has
passed Into history and with It Oakland's first
floral parade, which, by the way, was much
better than anybody expected. It has prepared
the way for a gTeat flower festival that will
show the world that Oakland has awakened
from her Rip Van Winkle sleep. No city in
the State has been so bountifully bles.*etl
by nature and a floral display could be given
here that would relegate Los Angeles' cele
brated fiesta to the ranks of the "has beens."
Now Is the time to begin planning. Yester
day's success was the result of a week's work.
What wonders might be accomplished In a
year! People are interested, the artistic and
patriotic spirit has been aroused and another
parade' would find in line all who were not
there yesterday â if the commercial phase was
eliminated. A parade that is used as a me
dium for advertising docs not attract the
class of people that would make it a suc
cess from an artistic point of view, as It
would be if only the home and the family
Â¦were represented.

The Southern Pacific Company has
taken the first step toward changing
the narrow-gauge line between Oak
land and San Jose into broad gauge,
and to that end engineers and survey
ors have been employed during the last
week In making estimates and plan
ning for the rebuilding of the shops
and yards at Newark for the accom
modation of broad-gauge rolling stock.
As soon as this work is accomplished
the transforming of the track between
Oakland and San Jose will be com
menced.
The principal reason for the change
Is to enable the company to divert the
excursion traffic to the Santa Cruz
Mountains, which is now handled en
tirely over the Coast line, to the line
on this side of the bay. Since the burn
ing of the narrow-gauge mole the com
pany has not had narrow-pauge cars
enough to run any excursion trains
by way of Alameda, and the car short
age has been still further increased
since the company transferred a lot
of its narrow-gauge rolling stock to
the Carson and Colorado Railroad in
Nevada.
It is expected that the work of
changing the shops at Newark will
be commenced within a short time,
and that the other work will be finish
ed as rapidly as possible.

most conspicuous in line. They had adopted
the brilliant crange and black colors of the

was completely covered with gorgeous yellow

enjoyment in senior bails, senior ban

The senior men banqueted in San
Francisco last night. The senior men
and women picnicked all day to-day in
Co-Ed Canyon. Mrs. Hearst was not
here to invite the class to her Pleas

compelled to give a picnic to them
selves. A platform was borrowed and
from this the speeches and songs rang
out. The men sanjr college songs and
the girls choruses from "Anyraan
Can't Graduate." Tables laden with
good things provided the luncheon fur
guests and entertainers.
The senior ball attracted a great
crowd to Hearst Hall this evening and
a half dozen happy hours were whirled
away in gay dances. The hall was

There Is something in English blood that
has furthered the advance toward personal In
dependence and democracy, but without the
circumstances of migration, without the un
conventional life of the frontier of Australia
and America, without the sparse population
and the essential equality of material posses
sions, this remarkable development would ap
parently have been out of the question. The
democratic spirit of America Is not altogether
a matter of blood. It was born of the free
life of the colonial farm?, and It was sup
ported by the personal Independence that was
The significant experiment In modern Amer
ican civilization consists in seeking to estab
lish the equal personal Independence of all
members of the nation. The new view of the
position of the ordinary man has the sanction
of only a few centuries of uaaxe in nations
representlns only a fraction of the hnman
race.
The most enlightened thinkers among the
Greeks emphasized this distinction. But in
recent. centuries a new conception of social re
lations has appeared which rejects the idea of
superiority ajid dependence and seeks the com
plete emancipation of each individual regard
less of his inheritance or his intellectual de
velopment. The new social order would place
the individual man in a position where he
would hold only such relations to hi:< fellow
men as might be entered Into by voluntary
acreement.
The course of social growth pf the early
civilized nations tended to raise into promi
uence a limited number of persons. These per
sons, by reason of their prowess, their intel
lectual development or the advantages of their
inheritance, assumed a position of superiority
and independence which diatlnrulshed them
from the Â£reat body of their fellow country
men. This appeared to be a normal result of
social progress In all nations, whether In Eu
rope or in other parts of the world, prior to
the rUe of the modern civilization of Europe
and America.
The annual Phi Beta Kappa oration
is one of the most Important and
scholarly addresses made at Berkeley
during the academic year. The ,mem
bers of the faculty attended this after
noon's speech attired in cap and gown
â the distinctive collegiate dress. Pro
fessor Moses said, in part:
A. SCHOLARLY ADDRESS.
BERKELEY, May 17.â The fluctua
tions of the element of personal inde
pendence through the history of the
various nations of the world from the
time of the ancient Greeks down . to
the days of modern industrialism and
labor unions was the subject treated
by Professor Bernard Moses at the
University of California in the annual
Phi Beta' Kappa oration delivered this
afternoon before a scholarly audience
in Hearst Hall.
Professor Moses is one of the leading
authorities in the academic world on
questions pertaining to the principles
of government and social growth.
Notwithstanding . the severe lim
itations of a short public ad
dress, Professor Moses treated his
subject in a comprehensife man
ner. He showed how America had come
into almost complete personal inde
pendence. He then sketched the man
ner in which modern industrialism and
the rise of labor unions had modified
this condition of personal independence.
ALAMEDA, May 17.â While attempt
ing to place Charles Radditz under ar
rest for Illegally taking striped bass
in San Leandro Bay, Deputy Game
Warden John J. Rahm and the fisher
man were capsized in shallow water
near the Bay Farm Island bridge last
evening, and a desperate struggle en
sued on the oozy mud.
Rahm and Radditz experienced much
difficulty in making the shore, having
to traverse a treacherous and miry
mud flat. Upon reaching firm ground
the deputy game warden took his man
to the City Prison, where Radditz was
booked and later released on bail. He
will be tried before Justice of the Peace
F. S. Cone.
Radditz, accordingrto Game Warden
Rahm, violated the law \Vlth reference
to the taking of striped bass by fishing
for them with a long set . cork line, to
which many hooks were attached, and
in catching fish that were smaller than
the legal size.

Holding still to the opinion of the founders
of thÂ» reoublic that our institutions mast be
based upon personal independence, there re
mains for the people of the United States r.o
course b'.it to tnsUt that those who have
failed to maintain such independence, through
lack of Intelligence or character, shall have
no part in the ex^rcis-? of political power, bat
the evidence of the required Independence will
not bf fotfnd In membership of a ypoclficil so
cial class, but In the possession of character
anl Intelligence, regardless of occupation or
social position. Pursuing this policy and
building on the stable foundation of personal
independence, there may be realized in this
republic a popular Government like that
dreamed of by the Greeks and fought for by
our ancestors â a Government that will stand
by the weak In the KtruÂ«*lÂ»> for â¢â¢xlstenc", that
will do justice ft) all mÂ»n an.l that will abide
through -the centuries as an inspiration to
mankind.
Under the earlier order the dependent, when
the evil days came, might receive a measure
of support from his corporate superior, binder
the old order persons not belonging to any
list of clients or dependents were scorned and
reject'-d. Under the new order persons not
belonging to any union or brotherhood also iui
fcr a social and industrial handicap. Lnder
the old order the Government has a slmi.jr
taek.with respect to those not under the pat
ronage of the new superior.
/ The free life of the country, responsibility
hor the Government and the absence of tradi
tion gave to the inhabitant* of the United
States a larcer measure o? i>ersonal inde
pendence than was ever enjoyed by any other
people.
But the rise of modern industrialism has
opened new prospects. It has put into opera
tion forces that make the preservation of per
sonal independence lor the built of the nation
exceedingly difficult. Employes are between
alternatives, neither of which conduces to their
Independence. In attempting to escape from
the hard exactions of employers thT fall under
the despotism of the directors of the union.
Although these corporate superiors ape cre
ated by the employes, they are still superiors,
and orders are sometimes Issued by them
which a fully develooed tyrant would hesitate
to issue, lest an outraged people would turn
and destroy his authority.

The great majority of the men of modern

corporate superiors In the form of uniona or
brotherhoods, and assume toward them In
some respect, the attitude of dependence to
ward personal superiors. They look to the
unions to fight for them battles which Indi

votes of its members Is not a sufficient fuar

contrary, some of the most complete tyrannies
that have ever existed have been construct^
by popular vote and upheld and confirmed
from time to time by an almost unanimous
plebiscite.

The freight trains will be handled at
Point Richmond, as heretofore. The
new time schedule for the arrival and
departure of local and overland pas
senger trains went into effect to-day.
Passengers for the regular Santa Fe
trains can now take either the Key-
Route ferry and transfer at Fortieth
street, in Oakland, to the regular main
line Santa Fe trains, or they may go to
Point Richmond, as usual. The Santa
Fe system now prciposes to transfer its
entire iiasser.ger service to Oakland via
the Key Route.
It was origrinally planned by the
management of the Santa Fe to con
tinue Point Itk'hmond as the general
terminus of the line and to operate an
accommodation train between- that
riace and Oakland, but ihis plan was
abandoned with the advent of the line
into this city. All the passenger trains
after being made uiÂ» here will proceed
to Point Richmond, back down to the
pier and there receive baggage. The
orews will take charge of the trains
here and will run to the end of the di
vision at BakersfieJd. .
This, city is now the passenger ter
minal of the great Santa Fe railroad
system. Beginning tto-day trains made
up of day and dining cars and Pull
mans were run nut from here, and the
overlands will go through to Chicago
as they are made up in Oakland. Here
lufore Point Richmond has enjoyed the
uf being the passenger and
freight terminus of the Santa Fe sys
tem, but the iiassengtr service is now
transferred to Oakland.

Parry went into some detail as to the
work accomplished by the association
during the year, and made a special
point of the fact that largely due to the
work of the association neither, the
eight-hour nor the anti-injunction bills
were reported out by any of the Con
gressional committees having them in
charge during | the recent session of
Congress. Parry declared both of these
measures to be socialistic in character
and said the fact that neither of them
made any more progress toward pas
sage than their reference to committee
was to be regarded as a great victory
for American principles of government.
Parry spoke highly of the Citizens'
Industrial Association of America and
recommended a close affiliation with
that organization. He touched lightly
upon' the" subject of reciprocity and
spoke favorably, of the good roads
movement. 1 the improyement of the
rivers and harbors and the develop
ment of the irrigation system. He an
nouced that the association had gained
a thousand members ln the last year,
bringing the total membership up to
3000. The, association, he said, was in
a better financial condition than It ever
has been. 5 .;:;/.
Thn closed shop is aÂ«aimt public policy and

recognized and that the day must come when
no industry will be allowed to run on tho

to contract in a collective capacity for the sale

making contracts which exclude other labor

TOPEKA. Kans., May 17. â Clad in
gorgeous raiment and proclaiming
himself Pope of a new Catholic de
nomination. August Schrader, the "di
vine healer." has again appeared in
this city. His vestments of gaudy hue
and made of fine laces and silk, with
trimmings of gold lace and royal, pur
ple, are in strange contrast with the
tatters he wore when he first pro
claimed himself a prophet in Denver
several years ago. As he walked about
the streets to-day carrying a Bible
and wearing no head covering, he sev
eral times declared that the denomin
ation he had founded, the "divine
Catholic faith," has 800.000 followers.

Schrader says buildings are being

members here as a nucleus he hopes
to establish an important branch of
his church.

Several of the deposed conductors
have come to St. Paul, where they had
very brief interviews with General Su
perintendent G. T. Slade. They were
told that the bond company had noth
ing whatever to do with their dis
charge, but that through hired de
tectives sent out by the general super
intendent evidence had been obtained
to show that the conductors were col
lecting fares for which no returns
were made to the company.
Each case was cited, but beyond the
claim that Slade had the evidence the
discharged conductors were given noth
ing in the shape of proof, nor were they
allowed to enter any denial to the
charges brought against them or even
given a hearing. Mostâ if not allâ of
the conductors insist that the charges
are untrue and desire an option to en
ter a defense. So far this has been de
nied by General Superintendent Slade,
and his continued refusal is . likely to
result in a complete â¢ tie-up of the
system.
ST. PAUL, May 17.â There is a pos
sibility that the recent discharge of
twenty-one passenger conductors on
the Great Northern system may result
in a general strike that will be effect
ive from one end of the system to the
other. It was announced when the
men were discharged that the bond
company had canceled their bonds and
the usual paragraph that the company
was sorry, but that their services would
have to be dispensed with was added
to the letter of notification.

PORTLAND. Or., May 17.â Three men
believed by officials to be George Gates,
Edward Vernon Gates and James Ar
nett, wanted on the charge of robbing
the Southern Pacific train at Copley,
Cal., have been seen near Chehalis,
Wash. This is the information received
by Chief of Police Hunt by telephone
from the Sheriff at Chehalis. The of
ficers to the north have been notified
to keep a close watch for the supposed
highwaymen.
The information received by the Port
land police was to the effect that the
three supposed bandits were all mount
ed and heavily armed. They were
sighted by farmers within about twelve
miles of Chehalis. All the men, the of
ficers say, answered closely to the de
scription of the robbers. It is thought
the bandits are making their way
north. Sunday morning the local po
lice received word that a man answer
ing the description of one of the Gates
boys was at Goble, on the Astoria and
Columbia River Railroad. Baggageman
Miller is the man who made the report
to the police. He said this man was at
work in a lumber yard there and haa
come there about a week ago. He said
the fellow seemed to be waiting for
some one. When he had been there for
a few days he cashed a check which
appeared to be much larger than would
be carried about by a common laborer.
It is believed he was there waiting to
be Joined by the other two fellows. He
left last Saturday and it Is believed
that he went north.

PORTLAND, Or., May 17. â Mayor
Williams this morning received a tele
gram from General B. J. Viljoen of
the Boer camp at the St. Louis World's
Fair stating that Gideon D. Joubert
and W. S. O'Donnell, who are lecturing
throughout the Northwest, were not
known as officers of the Boer army.
Joubert, who says he is a nephew of
the General Joubert killed at Mafe
king, is touring with O'Donnell, pros
pecting for suitable sites for an immi
gration of Boers to the Pacific Coast.
As the lecturers had been recognized
by all the Irish and German societies
and had been introduced by A. E.
Kern editor of the German" paper,
Nachrichten, the news came like a
thunder clap upon the Boer sympa
thizers here. Joubert. over the long
distance telephone at Forest Grove to
night declared that Viljoen, whom he
knew rversonally. was trying to injure
him. He spoke native Dutch to several
Hollanders here, and was everywhere
accepted as genuine. Joubert declared
that Viljoen was trying to injure him
that he might throw sunspicion from
the manner in which the Boer camp
at the World's Fair is being conducted.
Joubert and O'Donnell have lectured
all over the Middle West without be
ing challenged. Before that they trav
eled through Mexico. Joubert exhib
ited a number of wounds. A civil en
gineer who had been in the Transvaal
talked with him on the country with
out suspecting that he was an im
postor. ,
General Viljoen Says the Man Touring
the Noil Invest Was Not an Of
ficer of Boer Army.
LECTURER JOUBEKT SAID
TO BE AN IMPOSTOR
To this end he has ordered a large
stock of entirely new designs from the
best Eastern factories, and intends to
offer these goods at prices which will
command patronage. Meanwhile, the
present stock of up-to-date furnishings
will be closed out at even lower prices
than those which marked the recent rec
ord-breakJng sale.
Mr. Pattosien has chosen wisely in
continuing in an enterprise to which he
is specially adapted, and now that he
has everything directly under his con
trol the public may look for unprece
dented bargains.
W. J. Pattosien having bought out all
interests in the big furniture business at

conducted under the name of The Patto

on an even more elaborate scale than
heretofore.

Just prior to Neate's arrest by De

Carr was to drink the other, but be

poisoned cocktail was for himself and
he had swallowed the wrong one.

Wage* cannot be raised metaphorically
epeakinx, either at the point of a gun. by legis
lation, by the decisions of arbitration courts or
by the mandates of labor unions. The cause of
labor Is not to be advanced by physical Btrlfe,
by the monopolization of employment by
unions, by restricting the number of appren
tices, by striving to bring about socialism,
anarchy and the confiscation of wealth, by
seeking arbitrarily to limit the hours of labor
and to fix wages despite the operation of lawn
that are beyond the power of men to alter, or
by other .devices or efforts on the part of
organized labor which tend to reduce the per
capita production, to put life and property In
Jeopardy and to destroy individual enterprise
and American freedom.
It Is to the self-interest of every right mean
ing American citizen to fight for those vital
principles of his government that have madu
this the most protsperons and progressive
nation in the world's history â the nation that
PRINCIPLES THE ISSUE.
How to increase the per capita production
is therefore the first and greatest question of
civilization.- The panacea of organized lalxir
to create wealth by flat is childlike In its ab
surdity. N'n fcet-rich-quick schemes will eman
cipate mankind from drudgery. The principal
way to increase real wages is to Increase the.
amount of machinery, that is the amount of
productive capital. Who owns this productive
capital Is really quite Immaterial. The mate
rial point is that it be increased, and no system
could be devised that will more surely result
In Ite being Increased than that of Individual
ownership. Another way to Increase the per
capita production la through education and
training of the Individual to the end that hÂ»
may become more efficient as a wealth pro
ducer. Hence the need for Industrial schools.
Parry then declared that high wages
were a blessing and not a curse. He
said that all employers would prefer
seeing their men highly paid to seeing
them struggling for a mere livelihood.
But he said it was foolish to blame
the employers because wages were
not higher than they are. "Neither
the employer nor the employe," said
he, "can beyond a very limited degree
effect the rate of wages either one
way or the other."
Parry then declared that the only
way to raise wages is to increase the
per capita production. He said that
men really worked for commodities
and that since all commodities which
supply the wants and desires of daily
life must be distributed, if not for one
price then for another, then it fol
lowed that the greater the amount of
such commodities produced the
greater is bound to be the amount go
ing to each individual, that is the
greater the real wages of men will be
come. Continuing, he said:
HIGH WAGES A BLESSING.
In regard to the National of
Manufacturers I am positive that any crusade
having for Its object the crindlng down of
labor would meet with the determined opposi
tion of practically the entire membÂ»rs<hlp.
The policy of this association 1>> wimarily one
of j>eace. If v/e stand for anything we stand
for the development of American industry.
It is obvious that men will hesitate to invest
their capital in productive enterprises if it
means constant ytniTi" with labor unions and
If fre<:uent strikes tend to destroy trade by
n-.akintr uncertain the filling of contracts. In
dustrial strife adds a hazard to investments In
volving the employment of labor which cannot
fall to be Injurious to industrial development,
thus causing permanent loss to all classes.
Therefore our policy Is one which looks to the
maintenance of peace, and not to the adoption
of measures that will arouse hostilities.
The manufacturers and employers do not
desire this strlte, and labor should not seek it.
It Deems repugnant tu our ideas of twentieth
century civilization to tight out this nuetitlon
ln the gladiatorial arena. Surely any cause
with right upon its side need not fear an ap
peal to the conscience and Intelligence of Ms
American people. To defy government and to
trample ui>on the rights of otheru is to confess
to bcinE in the wrong. It likewise bears a
r?ar resemblance to anarchy and rebellion.
It is absurd to charge the manufactureâ¢ and
employers of this country with desiring war
with their employes. If there is anything
which the manufacturers as a class desire
more than another it is that of having loyal
and contented workmen. What's more, the
average employer will yield a good deal in or
der to have such employes. But he is not go
ing to yield his right to run his own business,
and he would be a poor tpecimen of an Amer
ican citizen if he did yield that right.
It Is also absurd to charge the manufactur
er* and employers with combining for the pur
pose of reducing wages and otherwise oppress
ing their employes. Of all the associations of
employers in this country 1 know of not a
single one that has for its object the oppress
ing of the employe. There has not been any
concerted effort to force a reduction of wagt-3
and I do not believe there will ever be such
an effort. There are some associations of em
ployers, particularly among the trade assocla
tlonn, that are continually struggling against
exorbitant demands of the unions, but these
associations arc constantly on the defensive
and their efforts to retain some fair share of
the profits In their business are not to be con
strued as efforts to oppress their labor.
After elaborating on the costliness
of labor strife, which he declared to be
a national calamity, he said:
The theory that the condition of labor can
be bettered by checking: production and mak
ing life and property insecure was put to an
extensive test and the results were disappoint
ing to those who believe in that theory. There
are many Indications which go to show that
organized labor Is learning: a very valuable
lesson in economics and law obssrvance, and
hi'i'ps can be reasonably entertained that the
strikes which have characterized the laat year
will be Iqss strenuous in the immediate
tuture. \
PITTSBURG. Pa.. May 17.â Nearly

the ninth annual convention of the

When a patrolman found Jennie June
sitting upon a curbstone and loudly
walling, the time was 2 o'clock a. m.

â¢<he replied that three men had wan

walked away. As she -was speaking

United States Infantry, also a civilian

So the trio was booked for battery and
disturbing the peace.
"This fellow is deliberately lying."
said the Judge to the Italian inter

So both Brandi and Moscow are in

is disposed of.
On the witness stand in Judge Mo

tensibly forgotten the story originally
told by him to the police and declared
'that he had not been stabbed, but sim

the Judge had not forced him to de

to complainant's unbounded surprise,
the delendant cast a dish of mashed

the aim was so accurate that the dish

Russ House culinary department which
resulted in the arrest of Thomas A.
Baylor, second cook, on a charge of

and the case lingered in Judge Mogan's
court until yesterday, when the de
fendant was adjudged guilty and or
dered to appear for sentence to-day.

unwittingly or with malicious Intent,
misinterpreted an order for a "ham

guilty of petty larceny and transferred
to the cage.
About half an hour afterward the
clerk called the name of John Smith,
accused of vagrancy, and the prisoner
who responded was no other than John
Flynn of pig iron fame. It developed
that while he was out on bail pending
a hearing on the larceny charge Mr.
Flynn indiscreetly went a slumming

orderly house.
He will be sentenced for both larceny

/.uihcr of "The Great In Music." "A rcpu!w
Hiftory of Muci.>'*~"How to Under

< Copyright. lriCi*. by Joseph B. Howies.)
. The self-playir.g attachment to the
Tionaforte is now before the public
with great variety and persistence. It
Is claimed that anv person attaching
cne of these things to the keyboard of
his piano and placing the perforated
roll of brown paper in proper connec
tion can play any piece whatever just
us well as the most expert musician
tan play it. Just what the exact facts
erÂ«: in this connection is what we now
propose to look into.
To those who thoroughlr understand
the art of piano playing the self-player j
affords great interest It is a wonder
fully clover idea and It appeals to a
most singular selection of the public,
ranging in special aptitudes all the
way from some of the most advanced
j.ianists down to the merest "farmer."
v.ho would like a little jolly music
while he waits. The advertisers tell
him that with the aid of this modern
lamp of Aladdin the world of music is
lighted up with more than electric bril
liancy.
Piano playing is a very curious mix
ture of pure mechanism and an intellec
tual-musical intelligence. You have to
do two things accurately from a me
chanical standpoint. First, to deliver
upon the key an energy equivalent to
the hammer stroke -you want in that
I-lace of the music: and, second, you
have to hold the piano damper away
from the string until the tone has
lasted out its time. If you fail in
cither particular your music shows it
et once. In addition to these two ele
ments of pure mechanism, you have to
vary the Intensity of your touch ac
cording to the "come and go" of the
mu?ic, varying by insensible degrees
from one note to anotherâ by degrees
f o delicate and so evanescent as to be
unsusceptible of mechanical measure
ment, and producable automatically
only, through the control of the fingers
by the musical ear, "musical sense" or
tonal imagination. You conceive a tone
cs to a certain relation to the one be
fore and the cne after it, and if you
are a good player your finger makes
this change in quality of touch just
light, or nearly so. Yet you cannot
by hours and hours communicate th^se
nuances to a poor player, until you
first of ail have succeeded in making
him hear them jn your playing, and
afterward nwko "him measure his own
playing by this mental pattern in his
imagination. Moreover, the varietv of
force is extremely sensitive, and when
you sound Eix notes at once you prac
tically never sound them all with the
Mine force. Even in chords the energy
is not equal In all the tones of a well-
Founded chord, but certain interval^
are more intense than others. Some of
these differences are accidental, and
practice tries to get rid of them; others
belong to the fine art itself, and we
Increase them in what is called "voic
ing" and "coloring" In playing. In good
playing (such as that of Busoni,
Godowtrky. in less degree with Harold
Bauer) the playing is full of a sensi
tive, palpitating fluctuation of inten
sity, which never has been measured
or determined mechanically and prob
ably never will be.
The first thing a self-player does is
to get rid of uncertainties. Given a
certain number of tones in a piece and
et certain relative duration?, the self
â¢p!ayer can be depended upon to put
them there every time. * It does this
by means of a very clever mechanism
or two of them. First, there is the
pneumatic actuating force. - The mo
tion of the player's feet exhausts a
vacuum in what is called the bellows.
The perforated roll of paper is punc
tured with little round holes and slots
mathematically placed according to
the tor.es wanted. The dots are short
, tones, the slots longer ones. The per
forated roll passes over the edge of
a sort of board, which Is perforated
by as many channels as there are keys
to be used. (None of the self-players
.operates the whole keyboard â all ig
nore the highest and lowest octaves.)
The playing fingers of the self-player
are little levers, felt shod, which are
actuated by means of little pneumatic
bellows. This affords an elastic and
sensitive force, more agreeable for the
purpose than any purely mechanical
lever action, which, when forced,
might break the key. In all the early
players the levers or playing fingers
were of equal force; In later times one
can rive added force to the treble or
bass at pleasure. You cannot, how
ever, bring out a single note In a
chord, as is often desirable in playing,
and the division between the range
where the bass stop gives you more
force and the other part of the key
board, where the treble has more
force, is very arbitrary and liable to
be crossed by the melody at undesir
able moments.
It is evident that no machine yet
devised can be made to distribute the
total energy of a large chord between
the various tones composing it in any
other than a crude and haphazard sort
of way. This part of the playing is
destined to remain mechanical. It is
impossible to apply extra force to the
melody tones and less force to the ac
companiment, unless the two voices
He farther apart than they usually do
in music meant to be played by two
hands. Here the. self-player is not to
the same extent a music player.
For the foremost of these contriv
ances will be found some very slowing
ers and river navigators, men experienced in building
levees and observers of flood action, will be called on to
give their ideas of the difficulty and the method of its
remedy. There will be many disagreements. Men are
not of one mind about it. This division deters remedial
action. It is expected that this convention will hear all
plans proposed, weigh one against the other and finally
in wisdom select the best in the hope that all interests
concerned will concur in it and join forces to effect it.
As the streams are navigable the Federal Government
has a voice in the matter, and the Government engineers
should be in the convention to give counsel and make
suggestions. The owners .of leveed property have rival
interests, since a plan that would protect some levees
might endanger others. The latter have their remedy at
law, and it must be understood that they will not fail to
seek it. Therefore, lawyers are needed in the convention
who will impartially point out what can be done legally
to secure one man's property without endangering that
of other men.
This all reveals the complicated nature of the questions
to be discussed, and it will not be in the. interest of a
solution to further encumber the convention with a mat

plant thrives profusely in Northern Ni
geria, and it is these forests which
are to be exploited. A 8amnle of the
plant has been analyzed by the botan
ical authorities of Kew Gardens, Lon
don, and these investigations show that
the rubber exists in the roots in suf
ficiently large quantities to warrant
development. The name of the plant
is Londolphia thralloniL It is to be
found in many places on the west
coast of Africa. One firm -which is al
ready engaged In the manufacture of
this rubber Is placing It upon the mar
ket at 75 cents a pound, and it is in
every respect equal to the ordinary
rubber.
India rubber has become such an in
dispensable material in the arts ami
sciences that users will be glad to
learn that a fresh source of supply
is said to have been found In- the
white mangrove tree, which grows
plentifully in the swampy lands along
the coast of Central Queensland. The
sap is obtained by making incisions in
the bark of the tree and allowing it to
run into tins. Some samples of the
rubber thus obtained are said to have
brought Jl a pound in England. An
idea of the Importance of the rubber
trade may be formed from the state
ment that the United States and Ens

pounds annually.

THE BUDGET AND A SURPLUS.
"Down in Honolulu." said the man of
many travels, "shaking dice in any
public resort is prohibited by law, and
the folk of gambling propensities have
to resort to the spinning of a coin when
they care to decide upon whom the
honor of 'buying" shall fall. Now, I al
ways imagined that I was about as
lucky in matching coins as the next
person, and one night I readily agreed
to play my part in the game of chance
to see who would open the wine. But I
was startled when my friends told me
that I must spin my coin, allowing my
opponent to call off 'heads' or 'tails* be
fore It had flattened down on the bar.
One of them pulled a dollar out of his
pocket and began to spin It.
"Well, sir, I lost eight times hand
running, and then I thought it time to
call a halt. Just as a wild bluff I de
clared that If there was any more spin
ning to be done we' would use one of
my dollars. My friends good-naturedly
agreed, and then they began tolose. At
last one of them laughed and admitted
that he might as well let me into the
trick.
"He showed me the dollar which he
had been spinning, and on the milled
edge he pointed out the least little cut.
which had been made so that a flake
of the silver stood out from the edge.
Then he explained by spinning the dol
lar how the coin woujd have an entire
ly different ring when'it began to settle
down on the nicked side from that it
gave forth when the uncut edge was
underneath. Of course, if I the nicked
side was 'heads,' for Instance, my op
ponents had no trouble in beating me,
whether they spun the coin or I did. It
was the clearest case of robbery that
I have seen in many a long day."

A prominent member of the Liberal
party when at school, runs the story,
was taken by his father to see Carlyle,
and was bidden to treasure in the
depths of his soul the words of wis
dom which would fall from the great
man. At first Carlyle was taciturn,
and the boy, by the way of opening
the conversation, suitably said: "I
have seen two philosophers to-day, for
as we came along papa pointed out
Herbert Spencer in a bus." With ma
jestic emphasis Carlyle replied: "And
have ye seen Herbert Spencer, laddie?
Then ye've seen the most unending
ass in Christendom."
Dr. Crozier, in his book, "My Inner
Life," tells of an interview with Carlyle
In which much the same opinion of
Spencer was expressed. He says that
Carlyle "went off into a peal of deri
sive laughter as he thought of him
(i. e., Spencer), and after a pause, and
in allusion perhaps to the extent of
Spencer's writings, he exclaimed con
temptuously, 'An immeasurable ass!
And so ye have been meddling with
Spencer, have ye? He was brought to
me by Lewes, and a more conceited
young man I thought I had never seen.
He seemed to think himself a perfect
Owl of Minerva for knowledge!' And
then, looking fiercely at me. 'Ye'll get
little good out of him, young man.* "
Herbert Spencer's opinion of Carlyle
was given to the reading public not
long ago and now the London papers
are printing a story giving the view
which the sage of Chelsea held of the
great philosopher.

While strolling far afield ono idle day,
I came upon a limpid, crystal spring:
A sun-flecked gem that purled within
a rinjr
Of golden buttercups in rich array.
Its tinkling little streamlet seemed to
say /
A woodland welcome to each living
thing,
Gray, sporting squirrels, and birds
upon the wing.
That on their happy errands passed that
way.
A crimson-breasted robin paused beside
The tangled, mossy margin of the
pool,
But ere he drank he voiced a melody
His joyous little heart could never hide*â
He trilled a song of thanks, then
sipped the cool,
Clear waters of the spring nl ecstacy.

SOME of the Supervisors have been interviewed in
regard to appropriating a portion of the taxes for
the ensuing year to the construction by the muni
cipality of a new road upon Geary street. In these in
terviews it is stated that they might use the surplus of
the taxes, over and above the allowance to each depart
ment, for the construction of this street railroad by the
city. . *
We do not see how there can be any such surplus.
The Charter requires that the Supervisors shall, between
the first Monday of May and the first Monday of June,
make a budget of the amounts estimated to be required
to pay the expenses of conducting the public business of
the city and county for the next ensuing fiscal year.
The budegt shall be prepared in detail as to, the aggre
gate sum and also the items thereof allowed to each
department, office, board or commission.
The Charter further provides that after the budget is
completed the several sums specified in the budget shall
then be appropriated to the several offices and depart
ments named in the budget, and the Supervisors must
cause to be raised by taxation the amounts so appro
priated.
There cannot, therefore, be .under the law any surplus,
unless at the end of the fiscal year there should be un
expended in any particular fund the amount estimated,
appropriated and levied for that fund for that year.
The intent of the law is that there shall be no more
taxes levied than are absolutely necessary to defray the
expenses of the city government. It is, therefore, pro
vided that each officer, board, commission and depart
ment shall submit both to the Supervisors and the Audi
tor a detailed statement of his requirements for the en
suing year;. that the Auditor shall, after examining these
statements, also submit a detailed statement of the re
quirements of each officer, board, commission and de
partment, and also a statement of the probable amount
to be raised by taxation to meet these requirements;
that the Supervisors shall then determine the amount re
quired for each officer, board, commission and depart
ment, set forth these amounts separately in a budget
and then levy a tax sufficient to cover these amounts
and no more.
Of course it might happen that in some department all
of the estimated amount might not be expended. To
meet this contingency the Charter' provides that this sur
plus be transferred to the General Fund. But it was
not contemplated that this surplus would ever be a ma
terial amount. In fact, so specific are the requirements
of the Charter to insure the smallest possible levy, that
a material surplus can arise only through gross incom
petence or dishonesty in the preparation of the budget.
There should not, therefore, be any material surplus
in the ensuing year's revenue to be available for any
purpose.
The only other surplus that could be included in the
term used by the Supervisors is a portion of the money
that was collected under a special levy for the purpose of
the building of hospitals and new school buildings. It
has been determined that this levy was illegal. A large
portion of it was paid under protest and suits have been
brought to recover the amounts so protested. Another
portion, however, wa* paid by many thousands of poor
people who were not sufficiently advised so as to make
their payments ,under protest, nor sufficiently able to em
ploy attorneys to push their claims. These people are
equitably as much entitled to the return of this illegal
tax as those who protested and have brought suit to re
cover the same.
At a recent revival meeting of religious people recently

"It is surely coming. Already they
condense eggs and send them in the
solid to the ends of the earth. Now
milk is being similarly treated. Only
when they have got the milk solidified
they do not devote it solely to culinary
purpftses. The fluid solidified becomes
mainly an article for manufacture. The
inventive mind of a Vienna scientist
has discovered a way of utilizing
skimmed milk for the manufacture of
sugar of milk andâ milk champagne.
The latter is mixed with fruit juices
and Impregnated with carbonic acid,

of casein cheese, glue and putty are de

substance which acts as substitute for
horn, shell, ivory, celluloid, marble, am
ber and hard rubber. Handles of
knives and forks, paper cutters, cray
ons, pipes, cigar-holders, seals, marble,
stone ornamentsâ all these are now
made of skimmed milk. Austria is
manufacturing the new substance at
the rate of 5000 gallons of skimmed
milk per day. The cow is thus not only
meat and drink, footwear, medicine and

are to build us marble halls of its milk.

testimonials from some great pianists
and anecdotes are numerous as to the
gratification it gave them to hear the
self-player, surpassing their fastest
and most even work. Rosenthal was
one of the first. .His famous version
in thirds of the Chopin "minute"
waltz was played in the next room far
faster and with greater certainty than
he could do it- So also Sauer testi
fied. And lately Paderewski has ex
pressed pleasure in certain points of
the instrument. Sauer's recommenda
tion was both instructive and peculiar.
He suggested that the Instrument
would be of great value to a pianist
for playing over a lot of new music to
find out which things he could expect
to make the best effect with. It Is
quite certain that no really great art
ist would have taken this view, for a
pianist does not need to hear a piece
played to find out how it ought to
Found. Why not read it by the aid of
his musical imagination? Certainly
this is what such men as Godowsky
and Busoni would have done.
Nobody knows better than the virtu
oso pianists the vast, incredible prac
tice required to develop their art. I
think they might do it with less, but
then the cold fact remains that the
men who have the virtuoso attainments
in the strongest perfection (such as
Godowsky, Busoni, Rosenthal, undoubt
edly Bauer) have practiced Incredible
periods. Godowsky for years practiced
from six to eight to ten and fourteen
hours a day. Faderewski is liable any
time he has a recital looming close
,ahead to sit down at the piano at 10
o'clock at night to go over a few things
and be pulled away from the instru
ment at 4 o'clock in the morning, en
tirely forgetful of the length of time
passed. This is the way it comes. And
the number of repetitions they make of
a given passage is stupendous. I have
myself heard Godowsky play a passage
in the Brahms-Handel variations scores
of times a day for weeks together.
When aske"d why all these innumerable
repetitions he answered that it was not
a question of getting it. but of it being
impossible to miss getting it. Perfec
tion and automatic certainty, these are
the goals toward which the virtuoso
aims. Then when he hears a mere ma
chine play Ijis most incredible effort he
is delighted and a little disgusted. But
if he is a born virtuoso he goes on all
the game, for after all a man is better
than a machine, even when he has
done his best to make himself a ma
chine.
It is not true that an untaught per
son, however sincere, can sit down to
the self-player and play Beethoven
sonatas, Liszt rhapsodies and romantic
symphonies as well as the greatest
artist. "Not by a jugful." He can, no
matter how untaught, sit down and
pump the instrument to its capacity;
he can adjust the roll and run it
through. What he gets will depend
upon good luck. For although the in
strument will produce the tones of the
piece in their order, the character of
the piece, its individuality, turns upon
securing the proper rate of movement,
the little holding back here, accelerat
ing there, and so onâ the little accents
which indicate idea. Before the sincere
person can play the music of a
Beethoven sonata he will have to learn,
like all the rest of us, how to steer itâ
when to go fast, when to go slow, how
fast, how slow. Even so much is not a
matter to be bought in exchange for a
selling stamp. Even when he has se
cured the proper rate of movement he
is by no means out of the woods. What
ever accenting the instrument permits
will have to be definitely applied where
it will do good and further the com
poser's idea-
Then there are the "fakes" of the
instrument, by means of which the ex
pert operator creates the illusion of
playing with expression, when, in fact,
it Is like Colonel Seller's fine distinc
tion of an "appearance" of playing
with expression- He can retard a lit
tle, accelerate', accent a little, and so
on, and all these additions to the pure
ly automatic performances of the in
strument are worse than useless un
less properly and intelligently con
trolled.
Yet there are artistic 1 uses and edu
cational uses of the self-player which
are of great value. Suppose, for in
stance, there is an ambitious teacher
in a seminary far from the city. There
is need of studying the chamber music
and symphonies of the great masters,
and there is equal need of hearing the
larger repertory of the piano itself,
for the great majority of music stu
dents stop before # passing a point
equivalent to the third reader in
school, and as yet there are no
"courses in literature" in music. With
a self-player everything can be repro
duced, and, what is better, it can be
repeated indefinitely. One can stop,
go ahead, linger over a passage, point
out relations between distant parts in
the work â in short, control it entirely
for instructive purposes, with no ex
pert help beyond that of a sincere and
fairly musical teacher. This is a great
field in itself. '.'
Then there is that increasing public
which likes to have the very words of
the great masters within easy call.
When one expects to hear a great
artist soon, it is of very great assist
ance to have studied the proposed
works in their detail, and yet in their
proper .speed. This the instrument
will give one. On one of the self
players they have lately affixed an at
tachment for securing the proper rate
of speed, by indexing on the roll a de
gree upon the "speed lever," and when
that is held at the degree mentioned
the roll proceeds at the rate signified
in the mark. This enables the stu
dent to start with the correct tempo.
Yet as to the details this kind of
education, like all development, goes
on two legs â the knowledge of the In
dividual and his care in personaUy
conducting the instrument-
Obvious as all these things are, I
have never heard of any buyer of a
self-player calling in the aid of a
teacher of music to assist him In ac
quiring the rather elusive knack of in
terpretation â that is, to school him
thoroughly in some one important
piece, using the printed music along
with the self-player. When a new stu
dent of some myslcal aptitude had
been carried through a dozen masters'
works thoroughly in this _way, he
would be able to obtain from his in
strument results of vastly better grade
than he could hope to achieve by his
own untaught efforts; and in time he
would learn the art of discovering in
any piece the Idea it contains and be
able to imagine how they ought to
sound in the connection where they
occur.
THE opening salvo at the Democratic convention
in Santa Cruz was lively- It presented many nov
elties. Mr. Tarpey resigned his well-earned place
as orator-at-large, and told the convention that as "the
personal representative of Mr. Hearst" he had certain
things to demand, among them being the chairmanship
of the convention and an instructed delegation.
We believe that this is the first time in American poli
tics that a convention was told by a personal representa
tive of a Presidential candidate that it must do certain
things and not do certain other things. A personal rep
resentative utters the will of the man he represents, and
it was as if Mr. Hearst were present demanding as his
right certain things from a delegated body. Such course
causes a convention to cease to be representative of a
part of the people. It becomes merely the instrument
of one j>erson. v
Mr. Tarpey's lieutenants followed, enforcing his de
mand. In his eagerness one forgot the common forms
of the English language, and in a rhapsody said: "Un
less those who support Mr. Hearst do not secure the
chairman of this convention, you must concede that-we
lose the battle." The double negative with a dash of
the subjunctive mode depressed the convention. It was
evident that the Hearst orators had absorbed their style
from the Examiner. Their speeches were like the recent
remark in that paper about the German Prince Ratibor,
that: "While fastidious in dress and manner he asks
many questions and answers queries readily."
As Mr. Tarpey put his candidate into the fight for the
chairmanship the convention took it up and the battle
raged until one member declared that "Jefferson had
never counseled Kilkenny cat fights," and strove to
convince the delegates that they must bury their differ
ences or call for two shillalahs apiece. This reference
to the time-honored and battle-blooded blackthorn
seemed to rouse the fighting spirit of the crowd, and a
San Francisco delegate introduced a fiery and defiant
bunch of whereases and a'therefore-bc-it-resolved, which
denounced Hearst for being a millionaire born in this
State and a traitor to it and to the party which was be
ing implored by his personal representative to support
him for the Presidency. Hearst's papers and his style of
journalism were roasted to a cracklin. and he was ac
cused of appealing "to the most easily satisfied lusts of
men, envy and malice."
Then one of Hearst's supporters, Mr. Tim McCarty,
took the platform to defend his chief. The report in
dulges in an anatomical description of Mr. McCarty.
His speech is not reported, and the incident ended with
a deputy sheriff robbing the platform of his interesting
presence.
Mid these sounds of confusion and creature complaints
a roll call was had and Mr. Hearst's candidate for the
chairmanship was beaten by the rather narrow margin
of twenty-two votes. This result uncorked more of the
vials of wrath. Several of the Alameda delegation de
serted Tarpey on the roll call, whereupon that personal
representative rose in his wrath and said: "All of you
that voted for Mr. Jeter are my friends, and I invite you
to partake of my hospitality in my private headquarters.
All of you who did not vote for Mr. Jeter I consider are
not my friends, and I do not\want to have anything to
do with you."
This instead of casting oil upon the troubled waters
was like throwing kerosene on the fire. The members
from Alameda who were outlawed from Mr. Tarpey's
graces, grub and headquarters went at him like bald-face
hornets, and the dove of peace flew high in a panic.
While the battle raged the astute McNab, leader of
the anti-Hearst forces, was ubiquitous and conspicuously
unoratorical. He kept his rhetoric to himself and re
pelled no one. He saw the danger in the narrow margin
by which he won the first battle and foregathered with
the weak-kneed Hearst men to lure them from the los
ing side and increase the strength of his own.
The editorial denunciations of Hearst in the party
papers were everywhere in evidence, but one of them was
influential above all others. In a late issue of his Colusa
Sun, General Greene said: "Let any delegate who goes
to Santa Cruz and votes to instruct for Hearst be cer
tain that he gets all his reputation is worth." That sig
nificant advice made a world of trouble. It was soon
made known to Colonel Mazuma at the Hearst head
quarters that while his supporters were on instructions
bent, they had a frugal mind. There was an immediate
reassessment of the value of reputations. The effect
was painful when it should have been pleasant. Instead
of being pleased that so many citizens of high repute
were supporting Hearst, it was evident that those of a
low degree would have been more welcome.
Another novelty was the impulse given to Hearst's
fight by the powerful hand of the Southern Pacific rail
way. His delegates rode on passes and entire bunches
voted with his personal representative on written orders
from that corporation. This, coming upon his frenzied
denunciations of the railroad,- let the light into the char
nel house and illuminated the hypocrisy which has been
the controlling influence in the California Democracy
for thirty years. So the curtain raiser at Santa Cruz was
surprising in its many novelties.

THE RIVER CONVENTION.
THERE are indications that the convention which
meets here on the 23d to consider ways and means
to handle our river floods may be diverted into
taking up the mining debris quarrel and so involve the
dredge miners on Feather River. The river channels are
incapable of carrying off great floods without overflow
ing the rich- lowlands. If there had never been a hy
draulic or dredge mine worked, in the State the same
incapacity would exist in the streams.
The question to be considered is the engorgement of
floods in the lower reaches of : the rivers, beyond the*"
capacity of levees to restrain them. This sole question
has difficulties enough without adding the mining issue
to it. We know of no one who will say that if all hy
draulic and dredge mining were stopped the capacity of
the lower reaches of the rivers would equal the flood
tax upon them. This being so, discussion of the ques
tion is a waste of time.
The floods have devastated a large and very productive
region. It has been for the time put out of action. The
loss, direct and indirect, is so large as to affect the great

into details with his complaint.
The Board of Health was represented
by Dr. J. I. Stephen, Dr. J. W. Ward,
Dr. D. F. Ragan, Deputy Health Offi
cer Louis Levy, Frank A. Schmitz and
Ward E. A. Elbert.
The appointment has hungr fire for
more than two months, but was fore
shadowed in these columns shortly
after C. E. Grunsky resigned from the
position to become Isthmian Canal
Commissioner. There were three strong:
candidates for the positionâ Woodward,
Henry Lynch and Charles S. Rogers.
The fight soon narrowed to Lynch and
Woodward. Herbert Schmitz, presi
dent of the Board of Public Works,
pleaded in vain with his brother to
choose Lynch. His Honor took the
ground that Lynch had never done any
thing to help him in his candidacy for
Mayor, notwithstanding he had strong
and influential backing.
Abe Ruef made a fight for Wood
ward and won. Woodward is a grad
uate civil engineer anfl has seen ser
vice in the Geodetic Survey. He has
been in charge of the Bureau of En-
Bineerinp ever since Grunsky resigned.
The position pays a salary o? $5000
yearly, but the salary may be fixed by
the Board of Supervisors and the term
of the City Engineer depends upon the
pleasure of the Board of Works.
Mayor Schmitz has been kind to
Woodward, having first appointed him
on the Board of Education, then on the
Board of Wc-rks and now as City En
gineer, each promotion carrying with
it an increase* of $1000 yearly in sal
ary.
Mayor Schmitz further announced
that he had not decided upon Wood
ward's successor as Commissioner of
Works. Th" Mayer said that neither
Lynch nor Rogers would be considered
as candidates because they failed of
appointment as City Engineer.
It will be interesting to note how the
Commissioners will vote on the ap
pointment at to-day's meeting. Casey
is known \o be not friendly to the
Schmitz administration, so Woodward
may be put to the necessity of voting
for himself in order to secure the ap
pointment.
Mayor Schmitz announced yesterday
that he had decided to select present
Commissioner of Public Works Thomas
P. Woodward for appointment as City
Engineer by the Board of Public
Works.

Health Officer Ragan yesterday con
cluded his investigations of dairies
and milk ranches in the outlying dis
tricts. As a result of his inquiries
Ragan is preparing a startling report
to the effect that most Jt not all the
dairies are in a deplorable and unsan
itary condition. \
So bad are the conditions discovered
by Ragan that he is preparing a sort
of blacklist, on which he will publish
the names of the owners of the dairies
that are lacking in cleanliness and
who pay absolutely no attention to the
simplest laws of hygiene in preparing
milk for market. In an interview
Ragan outlined what his report on the
situation will be. as follows: t
I was positively astounded at the bad con
ditions which prevail in the dairies which I
inspected. From my personal observation* I
am constrained to say that not one of thÂ«
dairies is fu'.tilllr.K the requirements demanded
by the sanitary laws. The cows are In a
filthy condition and the milkers are no cleaner.
The cowi are beins milked close to the
foulfst oft'al. which very often is splashed
into the cans of milk lying- near by. The
Joists In the roof of the barns are reekinff
with dirt which alwj falls into the milk cans.
It Is very evident 'that the milk and dairy
Inspection of tlie- i>ast has been 'a farce pure
and simple. Thlp Health Board is determined
to see to It that milk and food Is served pure
to the people and to that end has Inaugurated
a crusade asainst concerns that do not com
ply with sanitary laws. I shall recommend
to the board that vigorous steps be taken to
remedy the *vll of unclean dairies. I ven
ture to say that there are no absolutely clean
dairies within tbe city limits, notwithstand
ing the evidence before the Suoervizors that
some of them are models of cleanliness. The
blacklist which/ I propose to set up In the
Health Office containing the names of un
clean dairies will enable the public to as
certain which ones are unworthy of patronage.
If it is to be a three-cornered fight
there may be a close run between the
last two named, but if it is between
those two only the chances are that
Miss Falconer will win. Mrs. Lizzie
Pritchard of this city, an energetic
member of the order, will, in all
probability, be elected right guide if
the feeling that prevailed yesterday is
not changed in favor of Mrs. A. Lo
pez, her oppnent. Mrs. Assman stands
a fair chance of being the next left
guide. Mrs. L. Schueren, trie incum
bent, is without opposition for the of
fice of treasurer. Miss Wunderllch
wants to be inside and Mrs. McQuil
land and Mrs. Hogan are anxious to be
outside guard.
Last evening 150 members of the
order attended a theater party at the
Alcazar in honor of the officers and
delegates to the supreme grand body.
To-day more amendments to the
laws will be considered and then there
Â¦will be an election of officers for the
ensuing term. The indications are
that Mrs. George J. Berger, sub-chief,
will be elected supreme grand chief
by acclamation, as all supposed oppo
sition disappeared yesterday after
noon. Mrs. Mary Castle of Stockton
will undoubtedly be chosen sub-chief.
Rose Peters of this city, if Mrs. Cor
win, the incumbent, who has made an
excellent officer for a number of years,
does not. reconsider her announcement
not to be a candidate, will enter the
contest for supreme grand secretary
against May Falconer and Max
Boehm.
In the past it was the practice to
pay to the beneficiary of a deceased
member of a circle the sum of $100
as a "funeral benefit," less the amount
paid for two carriages. This law was
amended so that in future the amount
without deduction will be paid to the
beneficiary.
A committee consisting of Compan
ions Boehm, Sherin, Miller and Ber
ger was appointed to procure a suit
able testimonial for the retiring su
preme grand chief companion, Mrs. M.
J. Valente.
ELECTION OF OFFICERS.
A proposition to th\e effect that the
deputy of a circle shall examine all
officers elect as to their qualifications
and see that the chief companion,
sub-chief companion and right and
left guides are qualified to give the
initiatory work without the use of the
ritual was voted down on the ground
that in many instances it would be im
possible to find companions who
would memorize the work, conse
quently many circles would be with
out officers such as are named. The
argument presented against the prop
osition was that companions will do
their best to render the work without
the ritual, but that they will not be
forced to do it.
The following committees were add
ed to the regular standing ones of the
supreme grand body: Committee on
grievance and appeals, on distribution,
on written and unwritten work, on
press and on place and time of meet
ing. Rules regulating the duties of
each of these several committees were
adopted.
NEED NOT MEMORIZE RITUAL.
At the BPcond session of the Su
preme Grand Circle of the Compan
ions of the Forest. A. O. F., in the A.
O. F. building yesterday, the constitu
tion was so amended as to allow the
sessions of the body "to be held in
such place as the Supreme Grand Cir
cle may have selected at the previous
session," so that hereafter the ses
sion may be held anywhere instead of
in San Francisco, as in the past.
The law which declared that the
supreme grand crief companion had
discretionary xiower to call a special
session of the. legislative body of the
order when requested by ten members
in good standing was amended ho as
to make it mandatory for the supreme
grand chief to call such meeting when
requested by ten circles in good stand-
Ing.
Heretofore it was the duty of the
supreme grand trustees to approve or
disapprove of the bonds offered by the
supreme grand secretary and supreme
grand treasurer. The law was so
emended as to place that duty upon
the executive board.

sary improvements and the building of
additional hospitals, $22,000. The total
asked for this year is $441,350, while
the amount asked for last year was
$223,800.
Dr. J. R. Ward, president of the
Board of Health, averred yesterday
that the work of his milk inspectors
has been decidedly unsatisfactory, but
said that he was not prepared to go
The afternoon session was taken up
with the report of the Health Depart
ment and the statements and reports of
the heads of the different public insti
tutions governed by that department
The requisitions submitted were as
follows:
"What's the use of all this talk? You
go, Mr. Rogers, and get your Commis
sioners together. Have all these men
examined right away, and when they
are examined then come to the commit
tee and, make your report."
HEARS HEALTH DEPARTMENT.
"Then, again, there has not been one
case in which a mental examination
has been made but that I and the rest
of the Commissioners have been abused
in the columns of certain newspapers
of this city. A great many people think
that there is not a single piece of busi
ness performed beneath the roof of this
City Hall but what is crooked."
Supervisor Payot here interryoted the
Commissioner:
There has been so much complaint
from the various boards regarding the
inefficiency of the civil service men that
Brandenstein availed himself of the op
portunity to investigate.
It was ascertained that there are now
over 400 workmen employed by the
city that are not on the list, the reason
for which, Rogers claims, is that it has
been impossible to- have the men ex
amined. When asked ' why they had
not been examined Rogers said:
"In the first place', It is not a pleasant
duty to me to have to go to the offices
of the different physicians of this city
and ask them if they will gratuitously
give their services to the city in the
examination of these men. These phy
sicians have their buslnes to attend to,
and I do not blame them for not want
ing to spend their time for nothing.
Roncovieri was strong in his denun
ciation of the men furnished from the
civil service, list and maintained that
the Board of Education and_ not the
Board of Works should have charge
of the employing of workmen on
school buildings. He argued that, de
spite the fact that the workmen are
not instrumental in the education of
children, the Board of Education is
held responsible for the work and
should therefore have full charge of
its performance.
He arose and leaning 1 over the ta
ble said vehemently: "I say in good
faith that so long as it ig possible for
me to take efficient workmen from
the eligible list of the Civil Service
Commission I will do so, but when
those men are unable, whether
through old age, incompetency or in
difference to perform their duties as
they should, then will I immediately
employ such men as can do the work
properly, wl. ether they be union, non
union or civil service men."
Brandenstein listened attentively to
Roncovieri's declaration and when he
was through rose excitely and turning
to Roncovieri said:
"Do you mean that? Are you in
earnest? Mr. Roncovieri, kindly re
peat that statement in order that the
stenographer may make a note of it.
We may want that some day."
The Board of Education withdrew
and George A. Mullin, secretary of the
Library Commissioners, was sum
moned to appear before the commit
tee. The Library Commissioners ask
the samqj amount as last year and the
matter was taken under advfcement.
The Civil Service Commissioners
were next summoned and the remain
der of the morning's session was occu
pied by a severe examination of the
methods used by the Civil Service
Commissioners, They were represent
ed by Secretary Edward F. Moran and
President Rogers.
MAKES INVESTIGATION*.
The Board of Education appeared
yesterday before the Finance Com
mittee of the Supervisors to .discuss
the distribution of the budget as it
affected the requirements of the edu
cational bureau. The work has been
gone over time and again since the
beginning of the budget's distribution
and though the proceedings went
through very smoothly a sudden halt
was called when the subject # of civil
service was reached.

POOLROOMS ARE CUT OUT
BY THE WESTERN UNION
IÂ»residcnt dowry Refuses to Handle
Racing Returns, but the Reports
Are Secured Elsewhere.
NEW YORK, May 17.â Colonel Rob
ert C. dowry, president and general
manager of the Western Union Tele
graph Company, suddenly cut off all
service of racing news to all classes of
subscribers in this city to-day. This
action of Colonel dowry, taken entire
ly on his own initiative, without in
structions from his board of directors
cir any pressure from the authorities,
was the result of claims recently made
public by police officials that the pool
rooms of New York City could not ex
ist without the Western Union service.
Recently a civil organization called the
City Clnb made public charges that if
ihe Western Union would assist them
the poolroom evil In this city could be
â¢ r.prcomr. The action of Colonel Clow
ry is the result.
District Attorney Jerome began an
inquiry to-day into the poolroom news
matter. He had before him Captain
Gnddard of the Anti-Policy Society, Su
lÂ»erintendept Burke of the same society
and a man named Jones. Burke and
Jones, it is stated, told of arrangements
Ijy which a racing wire was to be
jilaced in Burke's house.
The poolrooms here went on with
business to-day after the Western Un
ion discontinued the delivery of reports
of horse races to its subscribers Jn this
rity. in many cases the delay in racing
reports did not exceed ten minutes.
If a man loses all his money he also
manages to lose nearly all his enemies.

DELMAR TRACK ENTRIES.
Eight good, fast boxing bouts, con
tested by clever men and with the snap
of professionalism, were given under
the auspices of the Hayes Valley Ath
letic Club last night in Woodward's
Pavilion. From the opening of the first
bout until the close of the last the show
was one round of clean, fast fighting-
The curtain-raiser was a four-round
go between Willie Sheper and Charles
Hipley. Hlpley was gjven the decision
at the end of the fourth round though
it was a close question up to the tap
of the gong. Hipley's nose was cut
in the early part of the first round and
his discomfiture was immediately added
to by a closed eye. Before the second
rcund was over the ring had much the
appearance of a young slaughter-house,
and from that time on the men fought
like demons. The decision, which waa
a close one, was well received.
Willie Ingham, a sailor lad. and John
Kircher furnished the second bout.
Ingham's left arm was broken in thÂ»
second round and after having been,
examined by the club's doctor he was
pronounced unable to proceed. The
bout was called no contest. Inghara is
much the same typo as Tom Sharkey
and has more the appearance of a
walking picture gallery than a fighter.
He is one continuous panorama of
tattooed scenes.
Harry Williams and Harry Baker
provided the third match. Williams
was the cleverer of the two, but lost
the decision owing to Baker's forcing
the fighting. Williams is a pocket
edition of Jimmie Britt and as quick as
lightning.
Charle3 Dunn, the "iron man or the
Hayes Valley Club, lost to Jimmie Kane
of the North Beach Club after four
rounds of the most sensational fighting
of the evening. Kane's ducking was
fine, and though he was unable to put
his man down for the count he man
aced to hit him when and where he
pleased.
Joe Kelly of the Hawthorne Club and
Jack Doyle of the Lincoln Club sub
stituted the match that was scheduled
to take place between Jack Moran and
Lew Powell owing to the latter failing
to make his arpearance. The substi
tute, however, proved to be a good
event and the house was well pleased.
Doyle was awarded the victory.
Ted Wolfe was awarded a question
able decision over "Rough House" Mc-
Donald, and the house hooted wildly.
McDonald .did the cleaner fighting of
the two besides doing all of the forcing.
Joe Thomas was given the decision
over Jack Stewart of the United States
navy after four funny rounds of fight
ing. Stewart, as usual, wore his pleas
ant smile and congratulated Thomas
upon his victory. The house was with
Stewart.
The judges for the evening were Dan
Arnold. Jim Ragget and Angel NeaL
Jim McDevitt acted as referee.
Although betting on the Canole-
Nelson fight, which takes place Fri
day night in Wood\vard's~Pavilion un
der the auspices of the San Francisco
Athletic Club, has not commenced yet
good judges of prices are of the opin
ion that Canole will open a 7 to 10
chance.
.The spectators so fortunate as to
wiraess his great bout with Britt at
Colma formed a high estimate of his
ability. He has a briliant style as a
boxer, is game and can v administer
punishment. In Nelson he meets a
strong, aggressive fighter, who is
never idle. Nelson is sturdily built
and shows himself a tireless worker
in training.
The Chicago fighter is at weight and
looks the picture of health. His man
ager, Teddy Murphy, thinks there is
nothing to the contest but Nelson.
Murphy compares the respective ring
records of the two men whenever he
is called upon to give his opinion as
to why he thinks Nelson will win and
he never fails to satisfy his listeners
that his boy is the real goods.
. The victory Nelson has over Jack
O'Neill stamps him as a wonderful
fighter. Only a few weeks ago Eddie
Hanlon met O'Nyeill in Philadelphia and
the accounts of the fight show he had
the best of the first four rounds, while
Eddie had a shade in the last two. If
O'Neill is good enough to get a small
margin on Eddie Hanlon the boxer who
can beat O'Neill must be able to go
some. Nelson and O'Neill met at Mil
waukee and Battling gave the Phila
delphian the worst sort of a thrashing.
He had him bleeding and hanging on
and he was barely able to finish the
last round without being knocked out.
This contest took place only a short
time ago and it created the impression
in the East that Nelson was fast com
ing to a point where he would make
it interesting for the best lightweights
Jn the business. It was only a short
time after this battle that Joe Gans
passed up a meeting with Nelson,
stating he was too tough a game to
take a chance with without being in
the proper condition for a hard fight.
If Gans would consider Nelson a hard
proposition and refuse to accept a
match with him unless he had an un
usually long time in which to train,
something he never insisted upon be
fore with other fighters, it is pointed
out that Canole will have anything but
an easy time of it when he faces Nelson
Friday night. Canole is one of the
most popular fighters that has ever
visited this city and he will have
plenty of rooters among the spectators.
The Fall River boxer has worked him
self into good condition. He says he
will be pleased to meet Britt in a re
turn match if he is successful with
Nelson. Canole will be backed heavily
to win by his Eastern friends who are
in the city.
Jim Hayward. the New York light
weight, who meets Harry Lewis in a
ten-round preliminary, is touted as a
good man and It is thought he will
beat Lewis. The other preliminary is
a ten-round affair between Frank
Raphael and George Herbert.

GIVES PLEASING CONCERT.â The Irvins
Institute held Its closing concert of the season
last night In Its hall at 2120 California street.
The programme had been carefully arranged
by Professor Herman Genns and gave great
pleasure to a large audience.
TWrd baseman Jud Smith of the Los
Angeles team furnished a period of ex
citement at Idora Park yesterday af
ternoon that threatened to convert the
diamond into a pugilistic ring.
With, full steam on Mr. Jud sprinted
from the players' bench to the center
rf the infield, moving aggressively
toVard .Umpire Jeunness. The spec
tators Quickly prepared themselves for
anything from a wrestling bout to a
knock out, but Smith evidently reccra
t?idered his hastily formed hostile plan
Â«nd contented himself with shoving
the .referee.
Other Angelenos hurried to reinforce
the ablcbodied third baseman and for
the next few moments the unfortunate
umpire was jostled and hauled about.
Then Mr. Jeujiness asserted himself
and retired Smith and Wheeler from
the game.
The trouble arose over a decision in
the fourth Inning that permitted Oak
land to tie the score. Schlafly had
reached third on his own double and
T. Streib's sacrifice. Byrnes, a semi
professional, who was doing the back
stop work for Oakland, then hit out a
long fly to Cravath. who threw in to
the plate to retire Schlafly.
Spies tried to put the ball on the
runner, who swerved out of the line,
but Jeunness called him safe. Most of
the southern players were seeking their
bench, believing the sice was retired,
when they learned of the decision. The
trouble them commenced.
Although the champions made but
two hits off Moskiman they won
out on a home run drive by Ros=s, who
pent Bernard home. A bit of blunder
ing by Devereaux and Sohlafly"s poor
work in the opening inning also con
tributed to the success of the men from
ihp south.
Two unusually clever catches enliv
ened the third inning. Flood rapped
out a long one to the left section and
at first T. Streib misjudged the course
'if the ball, but, running backwards,
he managed to make connection. The
next moment he was flat on his back,
but the white ball glistening in his up
lifted hand told that the play had been
safely completed. A few minutes later
<Ianley in retrieving a fly feJl to the
Krass. but maintained his clutch on the
sphere. The score:

CHICAGO, May 17.â Three promising
American Derby candidates made their
debut to-day in the third race at
Worth. They were M. H. Tichenor's
Flo Bob, for which he paid $13,000; S.
C. Hildreth's Burleigh, starting for the
first time 1 in his career, and J. C. Milas
& Co.'s Commodore. They finished in
the order named.
Flo Bob won so easily and so Impres
sively that he Is looked upon as a con
tender with Fred Cook's sensational
English, Lad at any distance. Flo Bob
was the medium of a plunge by the
Tichenor contingent. They played him
from 5 to 2 down to 8 to 5, making him
post favorite over Burleigh, which was
backed from 2 to 1 to 9 to 5. Baywood
set the pace to the stretch turn, where
Flo Bob went to the front and cantered
home the easiest kind of a winner, with
nearly three lengths to spare and un
extended. Burleigh had all he could
do to beat the fast coming Commodore
a neck for the place.
The handicap at one mile and seven
ty yards, which was fourth on the card,
developed a sensational struggle at the
end. Toscan, Huzzah and Gllfain all
finished in a bunch in a fierce drive.
The first-named won by â¢ a head,
while huzzah beat Gilfain only a nose.
The weather was clear and cool to-day,
the track fast and the attendance
large. Summary:

NEW YORK, -May 17. â James R.
Keene's Brooklyn Handicap candidate,
Toboggan, kicked the fence rail" and
cut his hock to-day at the post in the
fourth race and to this must be at
tributed his defeat. The race was
conceded a certainty for him, even
though he was carrying sixteen pounds
more than when he ran second to
Irish Lad in the Metropolitan. To
offset the increased weight he was
meeting only maidens. The only one
from whom danger was feared was P.
B. Duryea's three-year-old filly, Hor
tensia, a full sister to the well known
horse Previous. She warmed up well
and it was known she was speedy, but
few thought she could beat Toboggan.
A notable exception to the majority,
however, was John J. Ryan, whose
commissioners were responsible for
the plunge which brought Hortensia's
odds down from 2^ to 1 to 7 to 5.
Toboggan, with Burns up, had drawn
No. 1 position, a bad place for a slow
beginner. When the barrier was re
leased the favorite was so slow to get
in "motion and" his strides were so
short and choppy that many close ob
servers were amazed. A furlong from
the llnish Burns was riding and whip
ping him, while Hildebrand, on Hor
tensia, was calling on her to do her
best. Toboggan was unable to get up
to the Duryea filly, which won by two
and a half lengths. Summary:
FIRST RACE- Six and a half furlongs; sell
ing; three. year-olds and up:
netting. Horse, Weight, Jockey. St. Â«i Fin.

long and eventful. She left Baltimore August

with the cargo heated. Seven hundred tons of
the coal was sold at Montevideo and before
the vessel v-roce*4e<l the remaining cargo was
turned over and cooled off. She sailed from
Montevideo January 4 and reached here 127
days later with 1406 tons of coal. The Gov

The rate of reinsurance on the Brit
ish bark Pitcairn Island was advanced
yesterday to 15 per cent, with the
prospect of a higher rate very soon if
no report is received from the over
due vessel. She is now out eighty
four days from Caleta Buena for this
port. This is some days longer than
the longest passage previously record
ed and as the Pitcairn is loaded with
niter her failure to put in an appear
ance is causing not a little anxiety.
The Pitcairn is a steel vessel of 1320
tons and well known at this port.
She was built in IS 8 8 at Greenock.

" . BAKERSFZELD. May 17.â A shadow
Qf gloom was cast over .the Grand
polge. of the Knights of Pythias this
Â¦j.norning' when the announcement was
Â¦2iiajie that Joseph S. Ford, a delegate
from^ Rio Vista, had been found dead
in his room at an early hour.
_ Ford was present at the reception last
â¢iv^ht. and went home shortly after the
session clost-d in apparently good
Ii- alth. with the exception of a slight
.?hh! la the region of his heart. It was
JhÂ« intention of Ford and his fellow del
Â« Charles Kearney, to arise early
This morning and take a walk. Kearney
Â»ot up, but hearing no sound from the
other room attempted to awaken Ford
.i>y knocking on the door. This brought
no _ response, po the door was opened
and- Ford was found lying on the liuor,
he having died apparently upon enter- j
:yg his room.
Ford was about 60 years of age and
"had lived nearly all his life in the Sac- (
ramento Valley. He had been a mem- '
Â¦bâ¬r of River View L*>dge, Knights of |
Pythias, for upward of twenty years,
;ind held the oilice of K. cf li. and S.
at the time <Tf his death. He had been
postmaster at Kio Vista for several ,
years and eras an influential citizen.
Charles Ktarr.ey. the other delegate ]
*fr*or:> River View Lod^e. is almost
heartbroken over the death of his life- |
long friend. . j
The :Â»<â¢<!>â¢ will he embalmed here be- |
fore sbljanent, and the grand chancellor
lias appointed a committee to draw up
*a memorial and to attend to every
thing necessary under the circum
<-fanees.
The regular session of the Grand
lÂ»odÂ£e was called to order by Grand
Chancellor B. V. Sargent shortly after
9 o'clock this morning:. The session was
â¢spent in hearing the reports of thÂ»
grand chancellor and grand keeper of
records and seal. These reports show
that order is in a flourishing con
dition in this State, both as to finances
and membership â in fact, that it was
never in better condition in any re
ppect than at the present time.
At noon a resolution was adopted to
the. effect that out of respect to their
late brother. Joseph S. Ford, the Grand
.Lodp<? would stand adjourned until 3
p. m.. and that the members would as
a body escort the body of the brother
â¢to'tho Sar.ta Fe depot, from where it
will b*e shipped to Rio Vista. Friends
of the deceased will accompany the re
mains.
< Th n .afternoon session will also be
spent in hearing reports from the vari
â¢ous committees.
Th* evening will be devoted to the
# srand a^s^rr.My of the Uniform Rank
at the Courthouse.
. The Rathhune Sisters met in Odd
Fallows 1 Hall this morning- for organ- j
ization and practically went through i
the same routine as the Grand Lodge. Â¦
There were eighty-three delegates in
attendance in addition to the grand
â¢officers.
This evening the secret work of the
Iiathbonc Sisters was exemplified at
"the Armory by Sunset Temple Xo. 16,
â¢ at- which time a number of candidates
were instructed in the mysteries of the
order. A public social session fol-
Towed.
To-morrow will be spent in an ex
cursion to the oil fields, and it is ex
pected that at least 500 of the visit
ors will take advantage of this oppor
tunity to inspect Kern County's great
est industry*. The train for the oil
fields will leave Kern at 9 a. m. sharp.
" A pleasant spot along the river has
been chosen as the stopping place, and
â¢carriages will be on hand to take the
visitors to the near-by wells. A bas
ket lunch will be provided to all the
delegates.

ney Dozler presented in the Superior

nar, recentlv found guilty of man
slaughter, which was to the effect that ,
the juror had been improperly ad

Charles H. Braynard, attorney for the.
defendant. On the strength of the
showing made a citation was issued
commanding Attorney Braynard to ap
pear in court at 10 o'clock on the morn-
Ing of May 28 to show cause why he
should not be punished for contempt of
court.
The affidavit presented was that of C.

was a juror in the case and while the
defense was putting in its evidence, and
at a time when court was not in ses- j
sion. Attorney Braynard addressed him
in the following language:
"Well, have we made the case plain
enough for you?"
The District Attorney has taken the
affidavits of several jurors. There Is a
rumor to the effect that Juror M. B.

he would receive $50 if Gallanar were
found not guilty.

THE FUTURE REVEALED.
THE PAST DISCLOSED.
A â For a reliable and intelligent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE, 428 Eddy st.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the | ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts in your â¢ case, â¢ Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.
llu Is as conspicuous - for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading is not a life reading, When
you call on PHOF. LIVINGSTONE he will
elve you a full life readlns fÂ»r $1. A test
is of little value; when:. the mind is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.

Special Dispatch to The Call
The Rev. W. N. Guthrie of Christ
Church, Alameda, also gave a report of
his office, which was of the most satt
isfactory kind.
A discussion on the Pacific Church
man,, which came out Monday under
new auspices, followed.
The Rev. Mr. Parsons, rector of St.
Mark's Church. Berkeley; Rev. Mar
den D. Wilson, Rev. N. B. W. Gallwey.
Dr. Frederick W. Clampett; Re # v. David
J. Evans, rector of Grace Church;
Rev. Burr M. Weeden and Rev. Mr.
Walkley expressed their views as to
the future conduct of the church paper.
The afternoon session was brought
to a close by the Rev. Clifton Macon
with an address on "How Missionary
Apportionments May Be Met" and
Bishop Nichols, who took great inter
est in the proceedings, telling of the
work of the "Second Conference of the
Seventh Missionary District."
In the evening the Sunday-school
institution met. Rev. L. C. Parsons
occupied the chair. There were four
topics discussed: "Sunday-chool At
tendance," by .Rev. L. C. Parsons;
"Graded System." Rev. M.-D. Wilson;
"Curriculum." Rev. C. T. Walkley.
and "Teachers' Preparations," Mrs. E.
E. Osborne.
The Rev. Hamilton Lee gave a bright
report for Haywards, Niles and Cen
terville, and Miss Dorsey had nothing
but good reports to submit for West
Berkeley, where her missionary work
takes her.
The Rev. J. P. Turner of the Ca
thedral Mission, Second street, told of
the remarkable strides of the mission,
of its growth to three stories, of its
valuable property, now worth $30,000,
and with an indebtedness of only $8000.
He spoke of the pleasure with which all
are looking forward to the celebration
of the tenth anniversary of the mis
sion. It takes place next Sunday, when
Bishop Nichols will preach the* sermon
at the 11 a. m. services. Mr. Turner
also told of the clubroom and gym
nasium and of the dispensary in con
nection with the Cathedral Mission,
where the ailing are assured of neces
sary medicine. He also told of the
nursery, where working women may
leave their little mites in good care
while they attend their daily duties
and may go to wherever they are em
ployed knowing that their infants are
receiving the best attention.
DISCUSS CHURCH PAPER.
The ladies, said the Rev. Mr. Hayes,
had recently raised $400, and $2300 had
been received from various sources. It
is intended to build a guild hall, a gym
nasium for the boys of the church and a
club for the men.
The Rev. J. W. Jones of Point Rich
mond gave' a graphic account of the
successful work being done in his lo
cality, corroborating the statement
made by Archdeacon Emery.
In speaking of the Church Club and
the nursery for children whose moth
ers are so occupied that without the
institution they would hardly be able
to attend church, the speaker told of
the Ladies' Guild, where gossip and
unkind criticism were eliminated on
pain of a fine. The fine system works
well.
GIVE BRIGHT REPORTS.
Archdeacon Emery told of the needs
of Ocean View, where the people are al
most unshepherded, and It is a point,
he said, where a strong mission might
well' be organized. He discussed the
work under way at Fruitvale and Ala
meda and in Contra Costa and Marin
counties.
Reporting on church extension, the
Rev. W. E. Hayes spoke for All Saints
Church, Haight street and Masonic
avenue, and told of the increase in the
number of communicants of the new
church.
What can be said of that group, said
the Archdeacon, can be said of San
Francisco, for never before here had
there been so large a percentage of
communicants and applicants for bap
tism and confirmation as of late. Point
Richmond's spiritual growth, he said,
had hardly a parallel during these last
six months.
Archdeacon J. A. Emery opened the
session with a general account of
"Church Extension in the Convoca
tion" and "General View of the Field."
He gave comparisons between the con
dition of the missionary reports of the
diocese of fourteen years ago with
those of the present date. The report
showed wonderful growth.
The Archdeacon said that within the
last two years Haywards, Niles and
Centerville had grown from discourag
ing fields to be fertile.
RELJGIOX OX INCREASE.
The Convocation of San Francisco
was held yesterday at St. l.uke'3
Church, the Very Rev. William Carson
Shaw, dean of the convocation presid
ing.
Bishop William Ford Nichols was
present and the attendance was one of
the largest ever known here at similar
gatherings. The services of the morn
ing began at 10:30. in which Dean Shaw,
Rev. Burr Miller Weeden, Rev. L.. C.
Stanford, and Rev. D. O. Kelley took
part, the sermon being preached by the
Rev. Charles Thomas Walkley, who
chose for his subject "Stewardship."
The afternoon session was devoted to
the discussion of the reports of those
connected with church extension.

which 3332 were received from Oregon by
eteamer. The market continued weak for or
dinary stock, which dragged at prices ranging
from $1 35 to $1 50 per cental. Real fancy
stock, which formed but a small percentage of
the supplies, was steady at the maximum quo
tation. New Potatoes were steady and sur
plus lots were cleaned up by a leading shipping
house at $1 5001 75 per cental. A small con
signment of new Early, Jacksons came In
from the river, but had not been sold up to a
late hour. Oranges were firmer and there was
a good shipping demand for new Red.
The market was liberally supplied with mis
cellaneous vegetables and . prices showed con
siderable revision. Unattractive lots of No. 2
Asparagus sold at 3c per lb. but surplus
stocks of good No. 2 were bought up by the
canners at 4c. Peas were weak, with the caii
ners still purchasing at lc perÂ»pound. or C5@75o

receipts, picking having ceased across the bay,
owing to the low prices. Florida and Los An
geles Tomatoes were easier, the former being
offered at $2 75<fi.'t per crate. Mexicans were
In good request and firmer. The Panama steam
er brought up 714 boxes of Tomatoes and 148

NKW YORK. May 17. â The pressure . of
liquidation en a small scale, which has kept
prices of stocks tending downward for several
days, was relaxed to-day. This fact seemed
to be tlie principal motive for the buying
which lifted prices. In the language of the
Stock Exchange, the market had become over
sold.
There was no development in the news to
account for a change of temper in speculation.
But there were no new developments to In
duce further Belling. Unfavorable prospects
for values do not warrant selling to any defi
nitely lower level of prices, the process Inev
itably adjusting the price level to the new
condition of values, a marked characteristic
cf the trading was the extreme dullness which
overcame the market at the higher level. This
does not arsue well for the continuance of a
price movement in Its current direction. The
diEinclinatlon to follow the advance had Us In
fluence in renewing the doubts of operator*
over the outlook for values and In turning the
market heavy again. The most Important In
cident of the day was the publication of the
Weather Bureau's weekly summary of crop
conditions. It was of little influence on stocks
owir- to thÂ» little change indicated In pre
viously existing conditions. There were no
additions to the engagements of gold for ex
port and the rtee in call money rates was
checked, but the tone of the time money mar
ket was firm. Reports of the placing of some
sterllnc liana here gave the Impression that
the courre of the money rat's here and abroad
â¢was approaching the point of equilibrium.
which would Ftop the flow of specie from one
point to another. The winding up of the ex
tended United States Steel preferred stock
conversion syndicate was without disturbing
effect either on the money market or the Unit
ed State* Ft*e! *e-ur!t!es. which was a fact
negatively encou raring. The sharp decline in
United States Rubber stocks on the publication
of the annual report pronounced by the presl
d>nt to be tbÂ»Â» best in It* history was an ex
ample of the Inability of the market to absorb
offerings of stock accumulated in anticipation
of the report. 5*r*
Th" trmllnr became wholly uninteresting In
the latter part of the day. The closing was
qultÂ» firm, but the final rally was isllrht.
Bonds were steady. Total sales. $1,600,000.
Unltod States hond> wore unchanged on call.

CHICAGO, May 17.â With only four car-.
loads of wheat expected to arrive in Chicago
to-morrow official figures to-day showed that
contract stocks here nrc the smallest in ten
years As a result the January delivery closed
with a gain of %c. Initial sales were made at
a substantial advance, July being up #c to
%c at 85'*@SC'Â«iC. News in general was bull
ish and the market became still stronger. The
official figures as to the contract stocks here
whilo showing a small increase compared with
a week ago gave the total amount on hand
here as only 600,000 bushels. Under this in
fluence there wan quite active covering
throughout the entire dny. The weekly Gov
ernment report showtd that crop conditions in
the Ohio Valley ore poor and that rainy,
weather has Interfered materially with seed-
Ing operations. During the latter part of the
session there were some purchases made on a
decrease of 3,M)0.000 bushels in Bradstreet's
world visible supply.
The marUet continued to gain In strength
until witfiln the last hour, when a slight reac
tion occurred on profit-taking. After selling
up to K7%c, July closed at 80%c.
A bearish Government report and generally
favorable weather had a depressing /effect on
the corn market, notwithstanding the strength
of Wheat. July opened unchanged to %#fU c
higher, and closed at 47%c
Oats were Inclined to weakness mainly on
account of profit-taking by some big opera
tors. After openinc at 3S%ftKi.S%c, July de
clined to _3Â»c nnd closed at 38%c.
Provisions were firm on a moderate demand
from packers, with only light offerings. Small
receipts of hoes and higher prices at the yards
were bull factors. July pork closed with a
gain of 10c at $11 37 1 ,s: July lard and ribs were
each up 2%c, bcth at $<i 47%.

The right of Judge Frank H. Ker

any Judge of the court a temporary
order made returnable before the
Judge who issues it, -was the subject
of a lengthy argument In Judge Sloss*
court yesterday. Attorney George. D.
Collins, who obtained a writ of review
from Judge Cook of the actions of the
police in trying to close up a resort at
1129 Dupont street, â¢. claims that Ker
rigan had no right to assign the case
to Judge Sloss after Judge Cook had
made the writ returnable to himself.
.The opposite view is taken by Police
Commissioner H. W.- Hutton, attorney
for .the. police. Judge Sloss took the
matter under advisement.

Many there were last night at Cen
tury Hall who confirmed Schumann-
Helnck's prophecy that Gertrude
Wheeler would some day become a
famous contralto. Prettyâ with beauty
of the Christy typeâ finely formed and
of much magnetism, she won loads of
honestly earned plaudits at her concert
last night. Miss Wheeler was assisted
in a clever fashion by three well-known
arysts in the following numbers:
(a) 'â¢Poor Peter" (Schumann), (b) "The
Prisoned Nightingale." from a Servian folk
Bens iHer,schel). the Brahms quartet; (a>
"By the Waters of Babylon" (Howell) (b)
"Air.our, Viens Aider," from "Samson and De
lilah" (Saint-Saens). Miss Wheeler; (a) Ro
manze" (Chopin), (b) valse. "Maiden a Wish
(Chopin) Miss Tharp; (a) "Der Doppelgan-
Ber" (Schubert), (b) "An die Music" (Schu
b-rt) (c) "Ich Will Meine Seele Tauchen"
(Ralf). Miss Wheeler: (a) "A Kiss" (True)
b) "A White Chrysanthemum" (True) (c)
"A Japanese Serenade" (True) Miss Flyr.n;
(a) "By the Sea" (Flora F. Jacobl). (b) "Love
and Joy" (Chadwick). (c) "The Northern Days
(CUadwick). (d) -rake O Take Xnose Uiv*
Away" (Weil), (*) "Many a Day and Oft
Â«\Veil) Miss Wheeler: (a) "Dreaming:'
(Eranms). (b) "Coquette" (Brahms), the
Brahma quartet.
In the "Amour. Viens Aider," Miss
Wheeler showed tenderness of tone ana
manner, while in "Der Doppeldanger"
she gave evidence of strength and not
a little dramatic ability.
Miss Tharp's selections were distinct
ly good In feeling and technique, win
ning for her equal honors with Miss
Flynn, S. Homer Henley and Frank
Onslow.
Miss Wheeler will leave in July for
Dresden, where she will place herself
under the best teachers for two years.

WRITS OP HABEAS CORPUS
Judge Cook Holds That Joseph Camp
bell Jr. Acted as Asent in Sell
ins Champagne.
The applications for three -writs of
habeas corpus for the release from
custody" of Joseph Campbell Jr., who
was held to answer on three charges
of felony embezzlement, were granted
by Judge Cook yesterday afternoon.
Campbell left the courtroom with his
attorneys, but as soon as he reached
the sidewalk he was arrested by De
tective Bralg under instructions from
Captain Martin. He was subsequently
released.
Campbell was agent for a brand of
champagne and was accused of em
bezzling a number of cases of the
beverage. The Judge, after taking
time to read the testimony taken at
. F. W. Richardson, manager of "The
Glenwood" of Riverside, has taken the
management of Tahoe Tavern. His rep
utation-as a manager Is well known and
the hotel is to be congratulated upon
having secured his services.
Wants Memorial Hall.
A petition signed by a committee of
the Grand Army of the Republic was
filed with the Board of Supervisors
yesterday requesting that provision be
made for the placing of a memorial
hall in the proposed new public â¢Â»
brary building to be erected under the
bond Issue. The petitioners say the
liall would be utilized for storing his
torical works, paintings, tablets, fia??,
pictures and relics of a military char
acter which have accumulated during
the last twenty-five years in the five
posts In this city. In several large
cities In the United States such halls
Jiave been erected for the use of G
A. R. posts in connection with public
buildings.
Mr. "U*. C. Jones, optician, formerly of
the Haskell & Jones Co.. has associated
himself with Messrs. Hlrsch & Kaiser. 7
Kearny street. â¢
the preliminary hearings, decided that
Campbell acted as agent for the com
pany, as was shown by the warehouse
receipts, and could not therefore be
charged with embezzling it. If, how
ever, he collected the money in his
own name and appropriated it to his
own use, he could be charged with
embezzling the money.
After Attorneys Black and Thome,
who specially prosecuted the cases,
had consulted with the District At
torney, Detective Br?.ig was told to re
lease Campbell, as there was no mem
ber of the firm here to swear to a
complaint against him on the charge
of embezzling the money.

AT A CONCERT
The committee has ever since it started been
working to induce owners of big tracts to'
break them up so that small settlero may gain
a foothold. So far more than sixty large land
owners have signified their willingness to di
vide the tracts into five. ten. fifteen and twenty
acres. There are a lot more yet to be heard
from. I think most people believe that cheap
agricultural land forms , the greatest stimulus
to Â¦ the Immigration of a foreign population.
We will vigorously continue our work with the
Department of Commerce and Labor with a
view to retaining this desirable population
which has been gding to Canada' and bring
it to California. Cordially yours.
' RUFUS P. JENNINGS.
-You will be Interested In knowing that more
people have come to California apparently than
have gone to Canada. The greatest immigration
ti* Canada' over one road on tourist or one
way. tickets in the year 1903 was 70.000, while
the greatest over one road to California on set
tlers" rates' was 85,000. However. California's
record is really better than it seems, for the
tourist or cnc. way rate was not- open all
months in the year.
I think that advertising cheap agricultural
lands has been the greatest inducement which
Canada has set forth to get tourists. I' have
seen these lands advertised as low as $2 50 an
acre. This is usually wheat Ia.nd. but in any
event it has proved a great drawing card in
bringing people to Canada, and. no doubt it
has proved advantageous to the railroads to
sell the land . so cheap on account of the-in
crensed transportation and settling up of the
country. Much of this land belongs to the
railroads. Â¦ -

Among the morning witnesses were
Captain of Detectives John Martin,
Detective Tom Gibson, Theodore Kytka
and Joseph Collins. Theresa King,
the dance hall habitue, who testified
at the preliminary hearing, is at pres
ent in Reno, Nev., and by stipulation
her testimony was read as given at
the preliminary hearing. All testified
to the same facts as were disclosed
during the commitment proceedings.
The case will be continued this morn
ing, with Cooper on the stand under
cross-examination.
The defense asked for an adjourn
ment at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon
because it wished to lay a foundation
for impeaching the testimony of
Cooper. General Salomon said he was
not in the possession of the names of
other County Jail inmates who he ex
pects will give evidence of a con
spiracy against Soeder.
Beyond this the prosecution pur
poses to introduce a German woman
who will testify that she was asked by
Soeder to visit the two girls 'who ran
the Mexican restaurant on Broadway,
where Blaise took dinner in company
wjth Soeder on the night of the mur
der. The request was made, after
Soeder's preliminary hearing and
when he was in the County -Jail. It
is claimed that the request was made
in order to prove an alibi for the de
fendant. Other witnesses are prom
ised, who have never appeared heretq
fore.
To-day promises to be a busy one in
the trial. Handwriting Expert Kytka
will take the stand to tell that Boeder
drew the chart of the place where
Blaise was killed. Possibly the de
fense will admit this testimony, as
Soeder acknowledges that he drew It
in explanation to Cooper of the utter
impossibility of his having committed
the crime with which he is charged. '
WITNESSES PROMISED.
General Salomon, chief, counsel for
the defense, stated at the conclusion of
Cooper's testimony that he was ready
to introduce evidence to the effect that
It was perjured testimony. He claimed
that he could produce witnesses from
among the prisoners in the County Jail
who would testify that Cooper's testi
mony was the result of a conspiracy
of the prisoners confined therein, and
that Cooper was put Â£orth to wreak
their vengeance because his client had
refused to be robbed by them.
District Attorney Byington and his
assistant, R. Porter Ashe. ridicule such
a statement and Express the belief that
Cooper's narrative of Soeder's confes
sion is absolutely true. Equally cer
tain of its truth are Captain Martin of
the police force and Detective Tom
Gibson, who have worked up all the
evidence so far produced against
Soeder. Â»

The incorporation of Pacific Steel
Company two months ago in San Diego
was heralded abroad as a gigantic un
dertaking. Although French was not
made directly responsible for the stor
ies, â¢ they were nevertheless circulated
to the effect that many rich men of
the East, including Charles Schwab,
were behind the enterprise, which, it
was claimed, had purchased large coal
beds and iron mines in Alaska and
purposed / to establish its own steam
ship line between the" north and San
Diego and furnish coal and steel to all
points along the coast. Within the
last few weeks Schwab and others,
whose names were mentic-ned in con
nection â¢ with the new company, have
denied having anything to do with it.
"Sf^client has realized that he has
been imposed upon by French," said
Attorney Humphrey, "and he is taking
the only course open to him to protect
himself. As is alleged in our com
plaint, Speddy has learned that' the
Pacific Steel Company and French are
Insolvent and therefore it would be
useless for him to resort to any other
civil action."
QUESTIONS SOLVENCY.
C. F. Humphrey, Speddy's attorney,
stated yesterday afternoon that one of
the notes indorsed by his client had
been hypothecated with U. S. Grant of
San Diego for $2500 by French. Two
others had been traced to the First
National Bank of the same city and the
other two to the Union Oil Company,
which had received them from French
as a security in a land transfer deal.
The transaction occurred on May 5
and it is claimed by Speddy that a
few days . later he discovered that
French had hypothecated these notes
for various sums, thereby violating the
agreement between them. # Fully be
lieving that he had been imposed upon,
Speddy yesterday proceeded to secure
an injunction. In his suit he asks that
French be restrained from negotiating
the notes; that the court order the In
dorsements canceled and that the Pa
cific Steel Company accept the return
tender of the stock given him by
French.
A suit, involving the standing of thÂ«
recently . incorporated â¢ Pacific Steel
Company of San Diego was filed hera
yesterday. It is an action brought by
T. H. Speddy, a well known steel man
of this city, for an injunction against
the San Diego corporation and its pro
moters, among them C.'_ H. French, to
restrain the defendants from using
certain notes indorsed by the~plalntiff,
on the ground that the Indorsements
were secured by misrepresentation.
According to Speddy's complaint he
was recently visited by French, who is
an officer of the new company, and
asked to : indorse five notes of the San
Diego Imperial Construction Company,
a concern controlled ; by the Pacific
Steel Company. French, so Speddy al
leges, claimed that the "Pacific Steel
Company was backed by wealthy.peo
ple of the East, among them Milliken
Brothers, who, he said, had subscribed
for $10,000,000 worth of stock and that
the total amount subscribed was $14,
000,000. He represented to Speddy that
he wanted to use Speddy's name to
add to the influence of the corpora
tion. He persuaded the latter, says
Speddy to indorse five notes of $6000
each, which he pledged, according to
Speddy, would not be executed. In
return French gave Speddy 500 shares
of the preferred stock of the Pacific
Steel. Company.

"Because his statement was made so
cold-bloodedly to me," said the witness.
"He spoke of the killing as though he
had killed a dog or a hog."
Further testifying, the witness
claimed that Soeder told him the mur
der was done at 9 o'clock at night and
that he "monkeyed" around until 4
o'clock In the morning and then went
to the Cliff House. He said that Soeder
told him that he had no bloodstain
after the murder except on his right
hand and on his shoes. These he wiped
off with a towel and subsequently
threw the towel Into a manhole. The
shovelhandle used to. knock Blaise
down, according to the alleged confes
eion, was thrown In an alley. The wit
ness said that Eoeder did not Indicate
Also Cooper testified that Soeder had
made the first advances of his alleged
confession by asking him if he had any
good friends on the outside who could
help him prove an alibi for the murder
of Blaise. Cooper said he had good
friends, after being promised half of
$1000 for his services which, he said,
Soeder told him was forthcoming from
Germany. On cross-examination the
influential friends turned out to be a
man named Scott, whose present
whereabouts is unknown and an un
fortunate woman employed in a dance
hall on the Barbary. Coast, who was in
love with Cooper and visited him fre
quently in the County Jail.
"Why did you make this betrayal of
a secret you say was intrusted to you?"
asked General Salomon, chief counsel
for the defense.
LOOKING FOR FRIENDS.
The witness stated that in this cell,
during a conversation extending over
two weeks, Soeder confessed to him
that he had murdered Blaise. He
claimed that the defendant told him
of meeting two women on Union street
the night of the murder. It was after
Blaise and Soeder had left the Span
ish restaurant on Broadway and were
walking on Union street. Blaise could'
not talk English, according U Boeder's
alleged confession, and was left be
hind with the agreement that both
were to meet at the top of Russian
Hill. The witness was positive I of
the meeting place, and* said that it
was on the corner of Vallejo and Union
streets. Both of these highways run
parallel. . ... _ .; ,
Â¦ The witness said that about Febru
ary 4 of this year he met Soeder in
the County Jail. They met first in
the corridors while taking exercise and
subsequently arranged the joint occu
pation of one cell through the captain
of the watch at the Broadway County
Jail. A man named Day was an oc
cupant of the cell, and Soeder influ
enced the authorities so that Day could
be removed to another cell. At this
point Soeder arose and denounced the
witness as a liar.
One of the strongest pieces of evi
dence brought forth by the prosecu
tion was a diagram drawn on the mar
gin of a daily newspaper and ap
parently the work of Soeder. It Is al
leged thte was made in his cell at the
County Jail after his preliminary hear
ing in Police Judge Cabaniss* court.
It might easily have been a crude re
production of the map made by the
topographical expert of the Police De
partment.
Cooper claimed that Soeder drew
this diagram to acquaint him thor
oughly with the locality in which Blaise
was murdered, and that it was subse
quent to the detailed confession of the
manner in which Soeder had murdered
his brother-in-law. He said the pur
pose of the* map was to in
dicate to the witness, who thought
then he would be allowed his
liberty in February of this year
on a writ of habeas corpus, where he
might find persons willing to testify
regarding an alibi for Soeder. On
cross-examination he said he was still
a resident of the County Jail, but that
another writ of habeas corpus for his
release was to be argued to-day in
Judge Cook's court, where Soeder is
being tried for his life. The Judge
wrinkled his brows at this statement.
CALLS WITNESS A LIAR.
Once during the testimony of the
witness Soeder leaned over to his
counsel and said, loudly enough to be
heard :
"Why, the hop fiend "
INTRODUCE DIAGRAM.
"You are a liar and a thief," shouted
the defendant. "You stole your moth
er's money."
Thereafter Deputy Sheriff Meynert
sat beside the defendant and touched
him on the arm whenever a show of
temper was coming. Soeder was quiet
during the remainder of Cooper's tes
timony.
Bailiff Martin Welch nearly jumped
over the railing in his effort to quiet
the prisoner. Subsequently Soeder
arose again when Cooper was testify
ing regarding the manner of killing
Blaise and extended a clenched flst
toward the witness.
Twice during Cooper's testimony the
defendant arose to protest and his at
titude bore out strongly'the public im
pression that he is a dangerous man.
He first broke forth during the testi
mony concerning the changing of a
man named Day from the cell in the
County Jail occupied by Soeder, Day
and Cooper. Cooper claimed that Soe
der had arranged the transfer with the
captain of the watch.
"You are a dirty liar," shouted Soe
der: "vou asked for that change your
self." *
Cooner told in detail how Soeder had
met his brother-in-law on the night of
January 10 and deliberately murdered
him. He testified that the defendant
said that a man without money was
no good in this country and that "he
would as soon murder his brother-in
law as a stranger."
DESCRIBES BLAISE'S afCRDEU.
Sensations were frequent yesterday
In the trial of Leon Soeder for murder.
He is accused of cutting Joseph
Blaise's throat on the night of January
10. Blaise was his brother-in-law and
the prosecution claims that the dead
man was lured from an obscure town
in Alsace- Lorraine to San Francisco
and then foully murdered by Soeder at
the foot of a retaining wall on Taylor
street, between Green and Union
streets, for the purpose of securing ac
cident and life insurance money.
The main witness of the day was
John Cooper, a cellmate of Seeder's
at the County Jail. He has other
names and among them is John Henry
Cooper. Sometimes he follows the
business of boilermaker. He was ar
rested for the crime of forgery and his
inability to imitate a signature result
ed in his imprisonment.
He was the most important witness
of the trial. .Shaking hand and foot,
he told how Soeder had confessed to
him in their joint cell that he had hit
Blaise over the head with a broken
shovel, that still retained the riveted
end of the blade. Then he stood over
him, with his left knee pressed to
Blaise's back and slit his brother-in
law's throat with a knife held in his
right hand. This was the wound that
caused Blaise's death.
