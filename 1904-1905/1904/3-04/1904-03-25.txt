- The Tokio dispatch to the London Daily Telegraph, reporting that the Japanese had succeed
ed in closing the entrance to the harbor at Port Arthur, evidently was sent before. the foregoing re
port from Admiral Togo was received. Inasmuch as the admiral makes no mention of having block

sixteen battle-ships escorted the merchantmen which were sunk *ai the harbor entrance is absurd,
but the. correspondent probably meant sixteen- warships of all kinds.

TOKIO, March 24. â Vice Admiral Togo's report of the fifth attack on Port Arthur, which
was made on March 22. reached Tokio to-night and is as follows:
"The combined fleet acted according to the plan arranged. Â¦ Two flotillas of destroyers were
outside Port Arthur, as instructed; from the night of the 21st to the morning of the 22d. Although
during this time our destroyers were under fire of the enemy, they sustained no damage. The main
fleet arrived off Port Arthur at 8 o'clock on the morning of the 22d. .1' dispatched a part of the fleet
in the direction of Pigeon Bay and ordered the battle-ships Fuji and Yashima^to make .an indirect
bombardment against the inner side of the port. During the bombardment the enemy's ships grad
ually came out of the harbor and at the time when the indirect bombardment stopped, which was
about ,2 o'clock, the. number of Russian ships was five battle-ships, four cruisers and several destroy
ers. We believe the enemy was trying by making a movement of their fleet to draw us. nearer to the
forts. The enemy's ships shelled us indirectly and many of their shots fell near the battle-ship Fuji,
but our ships sustained no damage. At about 3 o'clock our vessels withdrew off the port."

"On the night of March 22 the Japanese fleet renewed the attempt to bottle up Port Arthur.
Sixteen battle-ships escorted seven merchantmen to the mouth of the harbor and under cover of the
bombardment the steamers ran in and were sunk in desired positions. Three thousand Japanese offi
cers and bluejackets volunteered for this duty. An official report is expected this evening.' 5
McKay's story is to the effect that
he was married about six years ago
in Lincoln, I1L He lived with his wife
only a short time and after leaving
her he took up his residence in Kansas
City. There he became acquainted
with and married another woman, al
though not legally separated from his
first wife. He left the second wife
soon after the wedding ceremony and
came to California. The crime he com
mitted in the East so preyed upon his
mind that he concluded to surrender
himself. Judging from latest advices,
McKay will not be prosecuted.

patch from Norfolk says the town was
dark at noon to-day from an immense
cloud of smoke which came from fresh
prairie fires west of here. Many per
sons rushed to their cyclone cellars.

in that section. Many houses and barns
near Atkinson were destroyed. A blaze
from Simmons ran thirty miles.

ing the case Into the Federal court.
Receiver J^ W. Wilson, in charge of
the affairs of the defunct Orange Grow

lowing statement this morning:
"It will be impossible to gain any ex
act knowledge of the affairs of the
Orange Growers' National Bank until
every detail cf its business has been
gone Into. We are at work on the books
now, and it will be at least a week or
ten days before we are finished. My re
port will be made to the Comptroller
of the Currency at Washington, and I
am not allowed to make anything pub

Governor Peabody to-day issued or
ders to Adjutant General Bell to send
300 more soldiers to ,Tel!uride.
"The miners may return if they be
have themselves." said the Governor.
A dispatch received to-day from
Telluride. which had been censored by
Captain Bulkley Wells, contained the
news that twenty Finlanders left that
place to-day. It is inferred from this
fact that the deportation of strikers
and their families has been resumed
by the military.
President Charles H. Moyer of the
Western Federation of Miners is now
at Ouray. where he is conferring with
the Telluride exiles. It Is the plan of
the federation to send back to Telluride
now and then a few of the exiles and
ascertain whether they will be allowed
to return" to their homes under martial
law. If the men are driven out again
they will abide their time until martial
law is lifted. Then they will return un
der the protection of the injunction is
sued by Judge Theron Stevens.
It was reported to-day that the West
ern Federation of Miners had made a
second appeal to President Roosevelt
to send Federal troops to Colorado. The
union men take the ground that Gov
ernor Peabody only put martial law in
force In Telluride to prevent the in
junction against the citizenry from be
coming operative. It is further stated
that the Governor has prevented the
deported men from enjoying their full
rights as loval American citizens, and
the call on the President for aid con
tends â¢ that Governor Peabody is vio
lating the provisions of the Federal
constitution. Two previous requests for
Federal troops have been made, one
from the Governor and one from the
miners, and both were refused.
ORDERS TO CAVALRY. .
Governor Peabody said to-day that
he declared San Miguel County in a
state of Insurrection and rebellion be
cause of the representations made to
him by public officials and citizens of
towns, who declared that a body of
men were arming outside the county
to join with men within the county
for the purpose of destroying prop
erty and inflicting personal injuries on
persons in Telluride. The message sent
to Governor Peabody is signed by
Mayor R. N. Rogers, several of the
Aldermen, the City Attorney, a Deputy
Sheriff, the County Attorney, two of
the militia officers living in that vi
cinity and by many other citizens.
STRIKERS ARE DEPORTED.
A special train bearing troops left
Denver for Telluride this afternoon.
The entire force of 300 men will be un

Sherman M. Bell.
The following notice was issued by
the local Miners* Union to the members
of the United Mine "Workers of
America to-day:
4> The declaration of martial law in
this county by Major Hill of the Colo
rado National Guard makes it obliga
tory upon all law-abiding citizens to re

The Papyrus Club, among its many
good programmes, had an exceptional

yeeterday that was devoted to the
compositions of Mme. Caro Roma.
Further interest attached to the pro

in securing the gifted*Californian to
interpret her songs, and -also valuable
assistants in Mrs. R. E. Revalk. a
sister of Mme. Roma, also gifted with
a delightful voice, and Mrs. Wallace
Wheaton Briggs. .The compositions In
cluded many that have found favor
on both sides of the Atlantic, notably
the well-known "Violets," that was
demanded by general request, and
"The Wandering One," a song cycle
that created a very favorable impres
sion on its production In England two
or three years ago.
Mme Roma, who was In charming
voice, opened the programme with
the songs "Forbidden" and "Separa
tion " The songs are both valuable,
ably written, and full of
clicirrn
Mrs.' Wallace Wheaton Briggs had
the somewhat arduous task of in
terpreting the song cycle with its six
numbers. She acquitted herself well,
particularly in the beau:iful "Doubt
Not" and "The Letter.". To Mrs.
Revalk's charge fell the . interpretation
of one of Mme Roma's most fortunate
efforts, the sacred solo "Abide With
Me " Mrs. Revalk has a pure and pow
erful dramatic soprano, and gave most
sympathetic rendering to the delight
ful number. She was enthusiastically
encored.;.^:;*" ,' ,' .-â¢
The programme closed with the sing
ing of "Violets" by Mme. Roma, at
the general request of the club. Dr.

to make a passageway for her Maj

"Don't bother," said the' Queen. "I
did not come here to disturb them."
After talking with several factory
employes who were in the midst of
their meal, which- is -daily- served to
some 3000 to 4000 persons, the' Queen
and her party, accompanied by Sir
Thomas, went upstairs to the room

The Queen has always tak'en keen
interest ln the institution, j which was
founded on her plan to give the poor
the cheapest possible food without sav

visit privately with Sir Thomas Lip

in closed carriages, accompanied by
Princess Victoria, Earl i Grey, treas

A "mor of the Queen's coming par

The news of the identity of this ex

LONDON, March 24.â Consternation
has been caused ln British Noncon
formist circles by a speech of Robert
W. Perks, Liberal member of Parlia
ment for the Louth division of Lincoln
shire, delivered yesterday at the open
ing of a, Methodist bazaar at Louth, in
which he vigorously criticized Rev.
Regfcald John Campbell, minister of
the City Temple here. Both men are
pillars of nonconformity, one of them
being practically the head of the min
istry and the other one of the most
prominent laymen. The two main
points of 'Perks' attack were Rev. Mr.
Campbell's recent presentation at court
by the Bishop of London and the pro
jected 8urpliclng of Dr. Campbell's
choir of the City Temple. V >/ .
"I was sorry." said Perks, "to see
a few days ago, when Mr. Campbell
wished to go to court, that he asked
the Bishop of London to present him
to the King. What would have been
said in the days gone by if Puritan
preachers, persecuted not by Parlia
ment, as they are now, but by a feeble
Stuart .King, had asked Archbishop
Laud to present them to King Charles?
Mr. Campbell would have been far bet
ter advised if he had asked the vet
eran' leader of nonconformity, Rev.
James Guiness Rogers, to introduce
him to King Edward instead of going
to a'levee hanging to the apron strings
of an Anglican Bishop."
Referring to the surpllcing of the
men and women of the choir in gowns
and velvet caps Perks said: ',
"Ritualism is a steep and slippery
slope. Possibly the next thing we shall
see is Mr. Campbell marching around
the aisles of the City Temple, followed
by his surpllced choir, chanting a pro
cessional hymri.wlth the reluctant dea
cons behind. These are days when
nonconformity is confronted with a
severe struggle. We expect our preach
ers to march with fearless, buoyant
steps and not become camp-followers
In the AnpMcan army."
John G. Mornn Accused of Breaking
IntoÂ»the Rooms of Duncan Mc-
Kinlav and Dr. Seibcrst.
John G. Moran was booked at the
City Prison yesterday afternoon on
two charges of burglary. He is a
stranger in the city, having come from

talks as if he had received a good
education.
Moran is accused of having entered
the rooms of Assistant United States
District Attorney Duncan McKinlay
at 632 Post street and stealing several
suits of clothes and valuable Masonic
emblems and badges. He Is also ac
cused of entering the office and resi
dence of Dr. H. Seiberst at Geary and

treats c-f life and things Japanese, and
"Adzuma, theLJapanese Wife," a play
in four, acts (1893). His last volume,
"The 1 Tenth Muse and Other Poems,"
was published in. 1895.
Â¦In his later years. Sir Edwin Arnold
gave many evidences of lack of mental
equilibrium and perversenesa. During
hi^ stay in Japan "some years. ago his
conduct. In Toklo and Yokohama- was
such that the English residents refused
to receive ..or. countenance him. VHt?
"Japanned'.' himself, donned Japanese
apparel and j leaving ; his own * people
cenfiorted almost entirely 'with; the Jap
anese, by whom; he was highly thought
of on account' of .his Buddhistic lean
ings* and. whom V he. in turn lauded
greatly.
. He was I thrice married, first In 1854
to Miss Katherine E. Blddulph, who
died in 1864. then to Miss Fanny Chan
nlng of Boston, both being daughters
of clergymen, and, lastly in 1897, in
London, to, Tama Ktlrakawa of.Sendal.

Arnold received many special marks
of honor from royal hands. On the
occasion of the- proclamation. 'of Queen
Victoria as Empress of India he was
made. a Companion of the Star of In
dia, and in 1888 was created Knight
Commander of the Indian: Empire by
the Queen. For his work, "The Light
of Asia," published in 1879, he was dec
orated with the Order of the White
Elephant by the King of Slam, and for
his "Pearls of .the -Faith, or Islam's
Rosa*ry," published in 1883, he received
from .the Sultan- of Turkey the Impe
rial Order of Osmanie In 18S8. He had
in 187G received the -second 'class of the
Imperial Order of the Medjidlch.
Young Arnold ptudied at King's
School, Rochester and Kings' College;
London, and then entered Oxford Uni
versity on an elective scholarship, and
was graduated with honors in 1854.
He early gave evidence of his apti
tude for verse, and in 1852 he was
awarded the Newdigate prize for his
English poem on the "Feast of Belshaz
zar." In 1S53 he was selected to ad
dress the late Earl Derby on his instal
lation as Chancellor of the University.
After some service as second master
of an English school he was appointed
principal, of Ihe . GovernipenJ. Sanskrit
College at Poona. India, and fellow of
the University of Bombay. He held
these offices through 'the: Sepoy mutiny
and until 1S61; , when he -resigned and
returned to England. During his stay
in India he contributed largely to crit
ical and literary Journals, made a num
ber of translations and wrote several
pAems and prose works. On his return
to London he became a member of the
editorial staff of the Daily Telegraph,
and in behalf of the proprietors of that
paper arranged -for the first expedition

WASHINGTON, March 24.âSecre
tary Taf t continued his statements be
fore the House Committee on Insular
Affairs to-day with reference to the
issuance of bonds for internal improve
ments and guaranteeing interest on
capital to be invested in railroads in
the Philippine Islands. The section of
the' bill making provision for bonds
for internal improvements was amend
ed so that the law to be passed by the
Philippine Commission creating the in
debtedness is to be approved by the
President of the United States.
The Secretary submitted an entire
ly new section on the railroad guaran
teeing problem. It authorizes the Phil
ippine Government to guarantee an
Income not to exceed 5 per cent on cap
ital Invested in the islands. The act
of the commission shall provide for
Governmental supervision of the
finances of the roads, their location,
construction and maintenance. There
must be two or more Government di
rectors on the boaTd.
The guarantee may be in the form
of a guaranty of interest on bonds
or of income on preferred or common
stock, or In such other form as may
be determined by the Philippine Gov
ernment. The total liability of the
Philippine Government under the guar
anty shall not exceed $1,500,000 annual
ly. In case the Philippine Government
cannot secure the construction of the
roads desired it is authorized to issue
bonds at not less than par to an
amount not exceeding $30,000,000, and
with the proceeds construct the need
ed roads.
Secretary iTaft explained that he was
not in favor of the Government con
structing the roads, but, he believed
that if the Government retained The
right to do so better terms might be
secured from private investors. â¢-
The committee did not act upon the
bill.
The time for filing petitions with the
Secretary of State expired at 12 o'clock
last night. Two petitions from the
Fourth Congressional District were
filed within the time limit. The pe
tition signed by Maurice I* Asher and
Philip Haskins emanates from the
regularly created Republican Con
gressional Committee of the Fourth.
The other petition emanates from a
committee of which Louis II. Ander
son is chairman and Martin Kelly sec
retary. The Secretary of State, Char
les F. Curry, must determine which
committee is the governing body of
the party in the district. When spoken
to on the subjoin last night Mr. Curry
said:
"I will not be able to determine
until to-morrow which of the two
petitions I shall recognize. Legal
questions are involved which must be
considered."
"That in case any Congressional
District Committee shall fail to issue
such call and file the necessary pe
tition in accordance with law. the del
egates to the State convention from
such Congressional District shall, dur
ing the session of said convention,
meet and elect the delegates and alter
nates from 'such Congressional Dis
trict to the National Convention."
The Republican Congressional Com
mittee of the Fifth District will not
issue a call for a Congressional Dis
trict Convention for the purpose of
electing two delegates to the Repub
lican National Convention. After con
ferring with representative Republi
cans of the district, George D. Clark,
chairman of the committee, 'has de
cided that a separate convention is
not desired by the rank and file of the
party. In this respect the Fifth Dis
trict adheres to the plan adopted in
the First, Second, Sixth and Eighth
Congressional districts.
In the call for a State convention
at Sacramento, adopted by the Repub
lican State Central Committee March
12, the following provisions are made:
"That in accordance with the call of
the Republican National Committee,
each Congressional District Committee
is requested to issue a call for a Con
gressional District Convention for the
purpose of electing the two Congres
sional District delegates and alternates
therefrom to the Republican National
Convention. â¢ .
Hector McRae, who said that he was
comptroller for the Rialto Company on
March 2C, 1903, then testified and the
case was continued. ?
W. J. Vickery, chief postofflce in
spector at Cincinnati, testified that he
had accompanied Inspector Cochrane
to Senator Burton's office on the even
ing that the indictment became known
in Washington. He ' substantiated
Cochrane's testimony and testified that
Burton said that he had appearel "only
as an attorney for the Rialto Company
before the department and not as a
United States Senator."
"At that time there had not been any
complaints," continued Inspector Coch
rane, "and I so informed the Senator.
On February 5, 1902, I received a tele
phone message from Senator Burton
asking me to call on him at his office.
After discussing several matters in
which the Brooks Brokerage Company,
the predecessor of the Rialto Company,
was involved. Senator Burton told me
that he wished to represent the Rialto
Company in matters before the depart
ment, for which he was, to receive a
large fee. He assured me that he did
not wish to antagonize the department.
He also raid that he had consulted sev
eral of his colleagues in the Senate and
they assured him that his connection
with the Rialto Company was legal
and that many Senators had increased
their income in similar ways.* Senator
Burton said that he had lost $10,000 re
cently for which he was not legally re
sponsible, but which he wished to repay,
and that his fees would revert to that
use."
INCREASING HIS INCOME.
When first questioned Inspector
Cochrahe testified that Senator Burton
had visited him at the Postofflce De
partment, the date he could not remem
ber, he said, and inquired regarding
complaints against the Rialto com
pany.
J. H. Aubere, a Washington news
paper correspondent, then took the
stand. He testified that he had ob
tained a di.ctated interview with Sen
ator Burton at about 3 o'clock on the
nfternc-on the indictment was made
public. â¢
"Shortly after 9 o'clock that night,"
continued the witness, "Burton visited
my office and requested that he be al
lowed^to read the interview which I
had prepared from notes 1 had made
in the afternoon. I submitted the man
uscript to Mr. Burton and he read it
carefully. The only change he made
in the original was that at his dicta
tion I Inserted the words. 'I did. not
act as an attorney for the Rialto Grain
and Securities Company before the
Postofllce Department in any matter.''"
Inspector Cochrane was then recalled
and in reply to questions stated that
the time of his visit to Senator Bur
ton was shortly after 5 o'clock on the
afternoon that the Senator is alleged to
have given the interview to Aubere.
"I told him," continued Cochrane,
"that as I had been a witness before
the Grand Jury I cc-uld not discuss
the evidence, but that the indictment
was found under section 1782, Revised
Statutes. Burton told me that he had
appeared before the Poetoffice Depart
ment not aÂ£ a United States Senator,
tjut simply as an attorney for the Ri
aito Grain and Securities Company. I
pointed out to him that my under
standing of the statutes was that the
fact that he had acted as the attor
ney for the Rialto Company was re
sponsible for his indictment."
REVISED THE INTERVIEW.
ST. LOUIS," March 24.â The Govern
ment rected its case to-day in the trial
of United States Senator' Joseph P.
Burton, whe- is charged with having
illegally accepted fees from the Rialto
Grain and Securities Company of St.
Louis. The action of the Government
came as a surprise to the defense.
Shortly after Judge' Chester H. Knim,
for the defense, had started his open
ing: argument. Senator Burton and
Frederick Lehmann, associate counsel
fcr the defense.-held a hasty confer
ence and Lehraann, interrupting Judge
Krum, secured a continuation until to
morrow.
In concluding its evidence the Gov
ernment showed by the testimony of
Chief Postofflce Inspector Cochrane of
Washington that he had been required
by Senator Burton t& call at his. (Bur-,
ton's) office on the afternoon that Sen
ator Burton's indictment was made in
Washington. Inspector Cochrane tes
tified that Burton had asked him on
what charge the indictment had been
returned. . ....

Why? Because I have to put up at

man's stomach will stand that sort of
thing without protest, any way I know
mine won't. It has to have some-
thing to break the fall and Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets is the crutch I fall
back on.
My friends often "josh" me about
it. tell me I'm an easy mark for patent
medicine fakers, that advertised medi-
cines are humbugs, etc., but I notice
that they are nearly'always complain-
ing of their aches and pains and poor
digestion, while I can stand most any
old kind of fare and feel â¢ good and
ready for my work when it needs me,
and I believe I owe my good digestion
and sound health to the daily, regular
use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, year
in and year cfat, and all the "joshing"
ln the world w'ill never convince me
to the contrary.
I used to have heartburn . about
three times a day and a headache
about three or four times a week and
after standing for this for four or five
years I began to look around for a
crutch and found It when my doctor
told me the best Investment I could,

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, and I have
Invested about 50 cents a month fqp
them ever since and when I stop to
think that that is what I spend every

hands with myself, for I can keep my
stomach and digestion in first-class or-
der for 50 cents a month. I don't care
for any better life insurance.

?Â»<<jre or less public criticism has been
Â¦ : .:v^cted at the Master Builders' As
s'x iation because of its policy in re

Â«nd supply houses to furnish materials

the effect of this policy being: to shut

HOLLISTER, March 24.â There has
been an inch of rain here during the
last twenty-four hours, which with
the showers usual in the spring makes
good crops a certainty.
GRASS VALLEY, March 24.â The
heaviest snowstorm in years for this
time of the year visited this city this
morning. As much snow fell during
the day as came down all winter.
-VVILLITS, March 24.â This place ex
perienced a hard snowstorm to-day.
It has rained here for the past fifty
two days. The rainfall for the season
is 77.S7 inches. During a snowballing

a revolver and shot at a railroad man

BAKERSFIELD., March 24.â There
were several heavy showers during the
day and it is raining to-night. The
hills are covered with good feed and
crops will be large. Twenty-eight
hundredths of an inch fell in the last
storm, bringing the seasonal rainfall
to about 3.41 inches.
TRUCKEE. March 24.â The month of
March has been almost a continual
storm in this vicinity. During the last
few days more" than two feet of snow
has fallen in Truckee. At Summit 23
feet of snow is reported and many
slides are expected. Railway traffic Is
seriously impeded. Another slide oc
curred at Cisco early this morning after
the blockade of yesterday had been
raised. The track has been cleared.
At Lake Tahoe the storm is too fierce
for the work on the dam to proceed.
The danger that was threatened last
week is believed to have passed. Two
days more will complete' the repairs.
The water is within two inches of the
top. the highest since the dam was
built. S
STOCKTON, March 24.â With the ex
ception of seme small reclaimed tracts
just north of the Calaveras River there
is not a reclamation unfiooded on the
east side of the San Joequin River
north of Stockton. Bouldin Island is
entirely Inundated. The levee on the
south fork of the Mokelumne River
broke early yesterday morning, but the
dredgers, piJedrlvers and steamers suc
ceeded in stopping that break and de
laying the flooding for the time being,
but flood waters from the Sacramento
continued, to pour through from be
hind and the San Joaquin River kept
steadily rising. The two streams met
near the junction of the south fork
of the Mokelumne and the San Joa
quin rivers and banked the water up
until at 7 o'clock last evening the flotfd
swept over the top of the levee near
Central Landing on, Bouldin Island,
and within an hour the entire island
was flooded. To b" exact, the break
on Bouldin Island occurred just in front
of the Zallos Hous?. It quickly widened
to fifty feet and the torrent swept
Chinatown away as though the build
ings had been chip?. The break is on
the south end of the island.
Bouldin Island was the, largest as
paragus tract in the 'world. About 7000
acres of the island was one unbroken
field of asparagus, and it was estimated
that this year's crop alone.would have
amounted to more than $500,000. The
island had been reclaimed for twenty
years and had never before been flood
ed. It takes three years to get aspara
gus yielding. Consequently it will be
four years now before that immense
industry can be brought to anything
like it was before the flood.

The Interurban is preparing to build
a short line from Los Gatos to San Jose
by way of Campbell. Other lines about
the county are also being projected by
the company, which, it is said, has in
terested Eastern capital to the 'extent
of 52,000,000. to be expended in building
electric roads in this vicinity.
The consolidation of these lines
would give San Jose a perfect street car
system. The rumored consolidation of
the roads could not be confirmed, as all
the interested parties either deny it or
refuse to talk. A gentleman close to
the managements of the various roads
said there had been overtures looking
to such a thing, but nothing has come
of it so far, as the parties are too far
apart in the valuations placed on the
roads.
PAN JOSE. March 24.â A consolida
tion of the San Jose-Los Gatos Inter
urban Electric Railway, the San Jose
and .Santa Clara Electric Railway and
the San Jose Railroad Company into
one gigantic corporation is rumored on
the street. The presence of Vice Pres
ident Kdwards of the Interurban Com
pany in the city gives color to the
story. Edwards is from St. Louis and
represents the Germania Trust Com
pany, which holds $500,000 worth of
bonds of the Interurban and has fur
nished money for the building of the
road. It Is known that a consolidation
of the roads was broached pome
months ago. The San Jose and Santa
Ciara line was willing to sell, but the
high price asked by the San Jose Rail
road Company blocked the deal. This
road is owned by the German Savings
and Loan Society of San Francisco.
The road runs north and south on
First street, with branches into the
four quarters of the city. The German
Savings and Loan Society secured the
road on foreclosure a few years ago
for a little more than $200,000. but when
approached by the representatives of
the St. Louis people asked 5700,000 for
the property.
The San Jose and Santa Clara Com
pany lines extend from Santa Clara to
San Jose, with a branch to Alum Rock
Park and a line ddtvn Tenth street. Its
length is about fourteen miles. The
Interurban runs from this city to Sara
toga and Los Gatos, a distance of fif
teen miles. The line has only been in
operation a few weeks. It is broad
gauge and up-to-date in equipment.
The other reads have been built many
years and v.ould require rebuilding and
modern equipment in a few years.

"It would have worse consequence
for other powers than Russia if Japan

a step would obviously be for the pur

If Japan should be successful in this

possibility is pregnant with all sorts
of danger, but we can fcardly believe
that Japan will venture to violate the
neutrality of China as she did that or
Korea."
The Russian military authorities have
fell themselves compelled to consider
the foregoing .possibility and to takv
the necessary precautions. A high
Russian official said:
The Russians have little iaith in the
Chinese generals, Ma and Mu, who
might disregard orders from Peking
and join the forces of Japan.
If the information received is correct
the Japanese have discovered that a
landing <>n the peninsula is too hard
a nut to crack and have elected to land
on the Chinese side, where there will
be no army to repel them. The only
two i>oints feasible for landing die

"There is absolutely no truth in the

while the statement that the way to

Major General Pflug telegraphs from
Mukden, under to-day's date, -as fol
lo-ws:
ST. PETERSBURG, March 24.â When
General Kuropatkin reaches Mukden it
is understood the Emperor's forces at
the seat of war will be divided into
three armies â one on the peninsula, In
cluding the Port Arthur garrison, under
General Stoessel, military commander
at Port Arthur; a central army, under
General Linevitch, and a northern
army, under General Baron Stackel
berg. Any idea that General Kuropat
kin's arrival will be signalized by ag 1
gressive tactics is discouraged in the
highest military circles, where atten
tion is called to the general's reported
injunctionâ patience, patience, patience.
"We can afford to wait, whether or
not the Japanese can," is the sentiment
among the believers in General Kuro
patkin.
He expects to force the Japanese to
attack him on ground of his own choos
ing. There will be no forward move
ment into Korea. On the contrary, the
Russians at the Yalu are now screen
ing their concentration to the west
ward, and they probably will retire
from a Japanese advance in force,
harassing and retarding the enemy as
much as possible until the prope'r time
to uncover the main Russian army.
. EXPECT JAPAN TO ATTACK.
The continued landing of Japanese
troops in Korea is exactly to the liking
of the Russian strategists. The bigger
the army disembarked there the better
they will be suited, being convinced
that, once Korea is filled with the Japa
nese soldiers, pressure of numbers and
the clamor of public opinion will drive
Japan forward into the arms of the
Russians. Nothing but a complete
change of. plan in the Japanese cam
paign, as developed up to date, will
compel the Russians to depart from
their determination to play a consistent
waiting game, being convinced that all
the advantages of such a policy He on
their side.
The Russians also express much more
satisfaction at the present situation at
Liaotung. The forces on the peninsula
have been reinforced to an extent which
will render a Japanese landing there
difficult, if not impossible, and the gar
rison at Port Arthur has been amply*
provisioned to withstand a siege. So
far as the peninsula is concerned, the
preparations there may now be regard
ed as complete. "*

burg vouches for the veracity of the
following report of a conversation be
tween General Kuropatkin and a
friend, which took place before the
general's departure for the Far East:
"Our fleet." said the general, "Is no
good to us for the moment. The best
it can do ia to remain bottled up at
Port Arthur and keep the Japanese
squadron there. Toward the end of
August our new fleet, which is being
made ready at Kronstadt. will have
joined the now useless fleet of Admiral
Wirenius, and, followed by coaling
vessels, will take to the Pacific a sup
plementary force of eight battleships,
seven cruisers and thirty-two torpedo
boats. It will raise the blockade at
Port Arthur and we shall be able to
oppose every Japanese warship by one
and one-half to one. By that time I
hope to have driven the Japanese from
the country into the sea."

The Japanese are expected to appear
as soon as an entrance is possible. The
Russians will oppose their landing, but
with scant chance of success. It Is im
possible to block the river. The forts
at the mouth of the river are unequal
to the task of repelling the Japanese
ships, which can come up the river be
hind the transports and cover the land
ing of troops.
Once the town is taken the invaders
y'ill find an abundance of grain and
food stuffs, while at the terminus of
the Russian branch railway above the
city there is a great quantity of coal
and a group of useful buildings.
The people about here became ac
quainted with the Japanese during the
war between China and Japan In 1S94-5,
and are ready to give them every as
sistance. This is true also of the peo
ple to the west of the river, where the
Japanese would be able to obtain trans
port, forage and food to an unlimited
extent.
NEWCHWANG, March 24.â Yielding
to the south winds and the high tides,
the ice fields that stretch from New
chwang to the sea are moving up and
down the river with the ebb and flow
of the tidal currents. The thaw ia now
proceeding rapidly and the Ice is ac
cumulating in deeply sunken masses.
The Russians say that the river will
be navigable in a few days, provided
the mild weather continues.

Newcbrag's Capture
by i Japanese
Is Certain â¢
Vice Admiral Togo has, sent an official report of the fifth attack upon 'Port Arthur. Beyond an
nouncing that the Japanese fleet sustained no damage it conveys no new details, but it is significant in
two* respects: No, mention is nuule of damage to the Russian warships and the present strength of the
Russian fleet is shown. Togo reports that five \ Russian battleships and four cruisers came ont of the liar
hor to engage him, indicating that Vice 'Admiral Makaron* has at his disposal at least that number of ves
sels. . The Tokio correspondent of a London newspaper cables that the Japanese* on the day of the late at- .
tack upon Tort Arthur, succeeded in blockading the channel.' . Admiral Togo's report does not confirm this.
Port Arthur has been so greatly strengthened on the land side; that Russia regards the. town as ab
solutely safe from 'capture, and it is said that * Japan *will probably not â¢ attempt an 'investment, prefer
ring to attack the Russian line of communications farther to the north. Port Arthur has been well supplied
with ammunition and provisions and is prepared to withstand a prolonged siege if necessary.
In an official report it is denied that the Russian cruiser Bayan was accidentally destroyed by
contact with a floating torpedo -and that a torpedo-boat was sunk by contact with a mine on March 6, as
reported in the British press. ' :
~Tlie arrival- of General Kuropntkin at the front will not be followed by any material change in the
Russinn plan of campaign. Russia will play a waiting game, with- the hone of drawing the Japanese
armies as for as possible from their base. The Muscovite tacticians believe that Japan will in time find
that an attempt to advance beyond the Talu will be preferable to maintaining an immense army in idle
ness In Xortljwestern Korea. '.
Despite denials, it appears certain that the Russian Government has purchased two great ocean liners
in Geipnany and is negotiating for others. These steamships can be converted Into auxiliary cruisers.
When the announcement was first made, that Russia was negotiating for private steamships it was said
that a formidable squadron of auxiliary cruisers would be formed to. accompany the Baltic Sen fleet to the
Far East during the summer.
Russian Government circles are disturbed over rumors that Japan is planning to land an army upon
neutral Chinese territory, whence it will advance upon Manchuria. Fear of a coup of this kind, coupled
with the belief that China intends taking a hand in the war, is causing much worry in St. Petersburg."
The surprising statement is made by the Shanghai correspondent of the London Times that David
son, appointed United States Consul to Antung,- has^ arranged wltli. the Japanese naval authorities to us-
Flst him to reach his destination. Antung Is at the mouth of the Yalu River and is the base of the Russian
army that is opposing the Japanese advance from Korea.
Newchwang is doomed. The defenses of the town are inadequate to withstand a Japanese attack.
Xow that the ice is going out of the Llao River, permitting transports and warships to ascend, the Mik
ado's forces are likely to begin the investment without delay. The capture of Xewchwang will Â«ive the
Japanese an important position not far from the Manchurlan Railroad, Russia's main line of communica
tion.

If the Norris & Rowe shows continue
to grow as they have in the past CaH
fornia-will be represented by a circus
as large as any in the East.
The coming of Norris & Rowe's big
show recalls the remarkable growth of
this typically Western organization
from a small affair to its present im
posing proportions. The story reads
almost like a romance. .
Andrew Norris was the founder of
the organization. In 1SS8 he s;arted
with one trick dog, giving exhibitions
at. various small entertainments. He
gradually added to his collection until
he had quite a number of trick dogs.
Later he took his- brother Clarence as
partner and the show was known as
the Norris Bros.' trained dog 3how. In
1895 the exhibition was turned into n,
dog and pony show and was exhibited
for the first time under canvas. In 1S37
H. C. Rowe. who had been managing
the organization, was admitted a part
ner.
In 1900 Andrew Norris retired from
the business and made his iiome in
Santa ' Cruz. Clarence I. No.-r;s and
H. C. Rowe absorbed his interest . and
the, firm has since then been known as
Norris & Rowe.
Wild and native animals were added
from time to time. Norris trained the
animals, and Rowe looked after the
business end. Andrew Norris made his
first trips in a carriage; then baggage
cars belonging to the- railroad com
panies were used. This season Norris
& Rowe determined to turn the aliow*
into a genuine circus, exhibiting in two
rings and an elevated stage. It now
takes, twenty cars to move the shiw
and the 210 people with it.
'In the early hours of the morning'
when the show arrives in a city it Is
an interesting sight to watch it unload.
The horse car is emptied of its draught
horses, riding horses and trick ponies.
First comes the cook wagon and tent,
for breakfast must be ready for tht*
army of employes by the time the va
rious other tents are .up and things in
shape for the afternoon performance.
After the cookhouse and tent are un
loaded come the animal dens and cages,
the . band wagons, chariots and other
vehicles. The exhibition is given un
der three tents which .cover about two
acres of ground. â ' .
United States Marshal Shine will be
allowed hereafter to transport prisoners
to the East in Pullman drawing-rooms,
he having been notified yesterday that
he had won his appeal made several
months ago ~ to Comptroller Tracewell
at "Washington, D. C. It has been the
custom of the Marshal in taking pris
oners to the East to use the drawing
room of a Pullman sleeper for such
purpose as being the best and safest
mode of transporting prisoners. Office
Deputy A. L. Parish wrote an exhaus
tive brief to accompany the appeal and
set forth the many weighty objections
to the use of second class or tourist
cars and of Pullman berths for this
purpose.
Comptroller Tracewell In rendering
his opinion said:
"My reasons for such allowance are
that the method of travel to secure
the safety of the prisoners in their
transportation is one that must be left
largely to the discretion of the Mar
shal. The Government is able and will
ing to safely transport its prisoners in
the way that will b^st secure their ar
rival at the destination sought. If the
statements of the Marshal are correct
in his explanations, if he had failed to
avail himself of the facilities and the
prisoners - had escaped he would have
been, at least in some part, to blame
for such escape. As deputy marshals
are permitted' the use of sleeping C3rs
by the regulations of the Department
of Justice, I see no "reason why they
should be relegated to second class ac
commodations on tourist cars."
At 10 o'clock yesterday morning a
dapper young man called at her
house and told her that Captain Dunn
of the transport dock wanted to see
her, as he had a package addressed to
her which had come from Manila on
the steamship Logan. He told her that
there were certain papers that would
require her signature, and as the Lo
gan was likely to sail at once shÂ«
must go down to the dock Imme
diately.
i* Mrs. Klein told the supposed mes
senger that she did not know of any
body in Manila who could have sent
her a package, but the dapper young
man was so full of assurances that the
package was intended for her that she
decided to go to the dock. On arrival
there Captain Dunn Informed her that
not only had he not sent for her, but
that there was nothing on the vessel
for her. "While this was in a measure
a surprise for her, it was nothing to
the surprise that greeted her when
she returned home.
Everything in the house was in con
fusion. Every bureau drawer had been
opened and the contents thrown around
miscellaneously over the floor. Not one
place had escaped the attention of the
robber. Her Jewel casket, which had
contained $1000 worth of gems, had
been forced open and all the valuables
taken. Not content with this, the thief
had carried away about $200 worth of
fine wearing apparel.
A robbery ingenious in method and
complete in design took place yester
day at 270 First street.' Mrs. Helen
Klein was the sufferer, and she is now
mourning the loss of her valuable jew
elry and also a lot of wearing apÂ»
parel.

PERSONAL
Dr. Jordan then dwelt upon individu
ality. He stated that he heard a man
ray that he could get along without the
respect of neighbors, but not without
the respect of himself. The public spirit
of the country needs personal honesty,
and that is bound to be at the bottom
of any public spirit. The speaker spoke
against individuality being carried to
excess. He said that the moving power
in society was the work' of individual
men. "Christianity Is the work of an
individual man, and also this great re
public"
Dr. Jordan then spoke of the light
that had been thrown on corruption by
public spirit and individual effort. He
dwelt upon the present trend of events
to lawlessness, and declared that â¢ law
was nothing more than a condition
upon which we agree to .live together,
and must be upheld by the man of pub
lic spirit.
H. R. Braden led the services and
Rev.- Robert E. Lee Craig, rector of
Grace Church, pronounced the benedic
tion. The lesson was taken from St.
Matthew, chapter 5, verses 13 to 16.
Frank F. Bostwick, cashier of H. S.
Crocker & Co., although of another de
nomination, has kindly furnished the
t>rgan for the services and acts as or
ganist.
Dr. Jordan upon being introduced
stated he had a little lay sermon to
preach on "Righteousness in Public
Spirit," and quoted from Emerson that
"the world is upheld by good men."
"Righteousness is doing right," said
Dr. Jordan, "not at some future time,
but now. Righteousness is active, mov
ing and not fastened down. It is doing
the thing that is right for us in our
lives and in our work. Wisdom is in
knowing what to do next."
The services yesterday brought out
the largest attendance of the week. Dr.
David Starr Jordan, president of Le
land Stanford Jr. University, delivered
the address, and took for his subject
"Righteous Citizenship in Public
Spirit." He made one of his character
istic talks and his address was replete
with good, wholesome advice. There
was no attempt at oratory, but rather
a heart-to-heart talk on a timely topic,
which was well received. Dr. Jordan
after the services expressed himself as
well pleased by the Interest manifested
and the personnel of the audience.
So successful have been the noonday
Lenten services in the rooms of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce under
the auspices of the Brotherhood of St.
Andrew of the Episcopal church during
passion week that there is a desire on
the part of many of the leading busi
ness men to have the services made a
permanent institution of the commer
cial district. It is cited as an example
that noon services are held in Trinity
Church, New York, in the center of the
business section, every' working day in
the year, and there is always a large
attendance. If sufficient encouragement
is given the movement in this city it is
designed to have fifteen minutes of de
votional exercise every' day at the noon
hour.

Two haunting scenes of Monterey

valuable style in several small bits of
canvas that one would like to own.
Especially is this true of "A Relic of

and mountain pieces, "Strawberry

hold places of honor well deserve'd.
John M. Gamble's "Wild Heliotrope" *
a striking study of the San Emedio
hills. C. C. Judson's "San Leandro
Marshes" compels admiration for its
truth and spirit. Benjamin C. Brown,
the Pasadena impressionist, is seen for
the first time at the institute, where a
number of his brilliant dashes of color,
among them "Poppy Fields in Pasa

Gabriel Valley" attract gratified at
tention. Another Southern California
artist is present in great number and
strength. This is Elmer Wachtel of
Los Angeles, more than a dozen of
whose distinctive pictures were wisely
accepted and hung. They show Wach
tel as one of the best living interpreters
of California scenery in all its startling
glory.
In preparation for the fine collection of
oil paintings the Searles gallery has been
greatly improved . under the direction of
President Willis E. Davis and Captain
R. H. Fletcher, the director, who per
sonally superintended the alterations.
The walls have been wholly retinted
and the lower portion covered with a
dull, reddish brown burlap that forms'
a capital background to the pictures,
while the former barnlike expanse of
surface is now broken at convenient
intervals by pilasters in olive green.
Overhead a broad canopy has been
spread under the skylight, cutting off
the reflection from the floor that made
a daytime view at former exhibitions a
rather unsatisfactory entertainment.
This year's catalogue is also worth a
word of praise. The cover design is
the result of a competition among the
students of the School of Design, in
which the first prize went to Miss
Bertha Boye.
The jury on the acceptance and hang
ing of the works exhibited was com
posed of G. F. P. Piazzoni. Mrs. A. B.
Chittenden. Miss Anna F. Brlggs,
Joseph Greenbaum and L. P. Latimer.
Members of the association will be
interested in the annual lottery dis
tribution of oils, water colors and
sketches. In accordance with the now
well established custom more than a
score of these, the contributions of
the artists of the association, will be
allotted at the close of the exhibition,
but members who wish to participate
must. leave their names with Assistant
Secretary Martin before April '21.
This year's exhibition is especially
strong in California landscapes. These,
both in number and merit, quite over
shadow the work of the figure painters,
although the collection presents several
capital portraits and genre pieces. Es
pecially noteworthy among the latter
are Mrs. Ackerman's "Bess," a delight
ful study of child life, quiet and full of
character, and the hardly less admira
ble "Theresa," by the same artist; Jo
seph Greenbaum's characteristic min
iature, "Brittany Woman," and his
"Gray Day in Holland"; Matteo San
dona's "Portrait of Children," a truth
ful, unpretentious presentation that is
not easily forgotten; Margaret Her
rick's conscientious and spirited "Mar
ket Day," -find Mrs. Matthews' strong
figure piece, "Red and White." But
the landscapes that ought to be men
tioned would fill a column.
The forty-ninth exhibition of the
San Francisco Art Association, which
opened last evening with a private
view and musical reception for mem
bers and which will remain open daily
until April 21, will be remembered as
one of the very best displays of Cali
fornia art yet seen at the Hopkins
Institute. For this admirable repre
sentation of the artists of the city and
State credit is due alike to the profes
sional members of the association ?and
to the officers and jury, who have
labored especially to make the show
a success. â¢

out have been chosen with excellent
taste, a rich shade of green prevailing
in the carpets and hangings, while the
woodwork is .finished in <:ream-white
e_nam<?l. In the smoking-room alone
a cheerful red Is the color scheme. A
small and conveniently arranged stage
is at one end of the auditorium, where
about 500 people may be seated. The
boxes overlook the rear of the hall,
and are richly finished with rich green
velvet hangings. The large number of
fine paintings which adorn the walls
of the various rooms is one of the
many pleasing features in connection
with the installation of the new club.
The club will meet regularly on the
first Thursday evening of each month
and the third Thursday mornings.
Various forms of entertainment, such
as lectures, musicales and dramatic
recitals, will engage the attention of
the members frequently, and the audi
torium will b e rented out for all such
affairs.
HeTe eminent men will speak on theme*,
connected with the home, and here music will
come with all its elevating harmonies. There
will be.' a library In which can be read the
thourhts of authors on topic* which concern
th* home. .Every civic question will be here
discussed. And its rights will always here find
a champion, for everything which destroys the
home inflicts a vital injury on the common
wealth. The enemy of the home is worse than
â¢; traitor In arms, for he poisons the life
gprinss of our | national existence. Let the
American home become decenerate and this
republic, which we love, and around which
cling the cherished memories of the past and
the jeweled hopes of the future, would fall in
a stupendous ruin, for the purity of the home
Is the safety of the state..
We wish to assure Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Smith
that we are of one voice In thanking them
for this beautiful building, which, in Its pure
architectural outlines, fitly symbolizes the pur
poses to which it Is dedicated, but our best
appreciation will be shown in the bending of
every effort to bring to pass that for which
It stands. " - â¢ â¢
Now, therefore, by virtue of the power in us
vested bv the board of trustees of the Mary
R: Smith Trusts, we dedicate this building to
the uplifting and glorifying of the home. May
God cause Its j work to- endure from generation
to generation, and may thousands of homes
hereafter arise and point to it as the source
ot their happiness and inspiration. . .
The Home Club has a membership
of about 300 and includes both men and
women. The purpose of the club is to
idealize home life and to create a
healthful" and cheerful . social atmos
phere. On the club's roster are the
names of many of the most prominent
men and women in Oakland., : â¢
. The new building, which was form
ally given over to the service of the
Home Club to-night, -is Situated on the
very apex of Cottage Hill, which slopes
back from Fourth avenue, in East Oak
land. The clubhouse is reached by ; a
stairway' of hewn rock, winding
through the vivid green of the grass
growif'hnL ;From Its .windows, the 'view
is magnificent.^ It is ; aV three-story
building, in the â¢ basement being, the
housekeeper's private . suite of ? rooms.
On the first floor 'are ,' the, receptidn
rooms, library, smoking-room and au

OAKLAND, March 24.â The new
bullding of the Home Club was dedi
cated this evening with elaborate exer
cises in tha presence of a fashionable
audience. The building, which was
completed largely through the efforts
of Mrs. F. M. Smith, was ablaze with
light and many notable people were
present.
j Rev. R. C 'Brooks opened the exer
cises with an invocation. There was a
song by the Orpheus Club and then
Rev. C. R. Brown addressed the audi
ence for a few moments. Mrs. Fred
erick S. Stratton sang, accompanied by
Mies Pauline Collins. There was an
other song by the Orpheus Club and
Mrs. Stratton sang "My Love's An Ar
butus." Harmon Bell delivered the
dedicatory address, in which he said:
We do not meet to-niifht to dedicate this
clvb building in commemoration of some paat
tvent, however, memorable or heroic, but the
purporcs to which It Is dedicated point to tha
luture and cluster around U>e home. At the
mere mention of the word "home" how the
memories thicken about us ot the old home. Its
Jo.vk and iWrasant aurprises, its partings and
reunions, its wealth ot love and itc uplifting
Ideals.
We forfcet, amid the claÂ»h, the clamor and
the tumult ot life, that the material things for
which we strive are but for the moment, and
passing away leave not even an echo to tell of
their departure unless they are dedicated to a
purpose In which dwells the spirit of Immor
tality. Only that which lives forever Is really
worth our while. All the rest is but a bub
ble, the plaything of a child. !
This building la dedicated to such an ever
living purpose, for from Its walls shall .go
forth every thought, desire and aid which can
add happiness, comfort and Joy to the home,
and these influences, parsing from one home
to another, will continue, on, we trust, for
ever.
In the cottages are fifty little girls, who in
tim* will become the builders of fifty homes.
Hero they will be taught how to develop the
highest type of womanhood, and also that
marriage should not be the result of a mere
fancy, but of careful character analysis', as
well ps love, and that happiness does not re
sult from the promise of one to obey the' other,
but from the obedience of both to those high
est Ideals which go to make the perfect home.
HOME PURITY IS SAFETY.
Lester Birch, 16 years old, a United
States postofflce messenger, was struck
this evening shortly before 9 o'clock by
an east-bound Seventh street local
train at Willow and Seventh streets
and both his legs were cut off below the
knees. The boy was crossing the track
on his bicycle and did not see the train
approaching in time to save himself.
The engine struck him and several cars
passed over his legs before the train
was stopped.
C. S. Griffith carried tlie mangled
boy to a nearby drug store, whence he
was removed to the Receiving Hos
pital. The surgeons amputated the
crushed limbs, but said there was little
chance for the injured boy's recovery,
so serious was the shock and the hem
orrhage.
Young Birch had gone to West Oak
land with special delivery letters. . His
first thought through all of the shock
and suffering was for the mail that had
been given in. his care. "Whatever you
do to me." said the plucky young mes
senger, "look out for those letters. They
must be taken in charge by somebody
from the postofflce." ,-- â¢
Birch's home is at 428% Eleventh
street, where he resides ,wlth his moth
er. Peculiarly pathetic was the occur
rence, the boy's mother being seriously
ill and in Â¦ straitened circumstances.
His earnings went to support her.

The address was given at the Invita
tion of Miss Mamie M. Campbell, prin
cipal'of the school. ,
Through the list. went C.aptain Peter
sen. detailing numerous ordinances
along these lines and concluding with a
catechising of the thoroughly interest
ed little people, whose -answers indi
cated they had appreciated the purpose
of the talk to them.
.Then the speaker followe.d with an in
teresting explanation of the real place
a policeman should occupy in the work
of safeguarding the community. He
said: .
The policeman Is paid to care for and to
protect the children of the city. He ts paid
to advise and watch them and to urtiard thÂ»*m
&esir>t injury. To do that he must enforce
the wlw law* that are male to that fnd. r3o
it is that -the law dec'area children under cer
tain aew! murt not roam the ntreets late at
night. ThÂ«r curfew law. It If called, and it is
intended to protrct children egalnst. many
dangers. TlM-re is a Inw which prohibits chil
dren from jumping on x>r off moving trains.
It la Intended to protect life and limb. Po
licemen enforce that law aV a' protection * to
children. .
Two hundred pupils ! of the Grove
street public school composed an audi
ence this afternoon which heard a
unique address by Captain of Police W.
J. Petersen on the relations of the po
liceman to the ubiquitous pmall boy,
his pranks, his play and his daily round
of life. It was the beginning of an ef
fort on the part of the police officer to
bring before the youth of the schools
in a plain, simple way the reasons why
certain laws are enforced that seem
obnoxious to the boy.
"How many children are afraid of a
policeman?" queried Captain Petersen
at the outset. The response was an al
most unanimous raising of hands.

Talks to iV a. Large Aud
ience at Public School
It developed to-day that there was
seme shooting yesterday morning In
Co-ed Canyon, to which a lot of fresh
men and a night watchman were the
parties.- The watchman's name 1*
James Smith. He came upon the stu
dents in the canyon and ordered them
to move on. They did move on, but
had not gone far when one of them
fired two shots. Smith fired a shot to
attract the attention of Professor Cory
and his posse, but : by the time they
arrived the belligerents had fled far
away.
Just what charge the committee can
bring against the students is somethings
of a mystery. None of those captured
were on Charter Hill and none were
engaged in a rush: so it remains for
the committee to charge that they vio
lated the spirit of the committee**
manifesto that there must be no at
tempt at rushing. The committee takes
the ground that the .students would
have rushed if they could. It was the
ounce of prevention, administered by
the committee, that prevented.
"The affair -will be fully investigated
by the committee," said Professor Cory
to-day. "Every man caught will be
given a full hearing: by us. He will
have a chance to fully explain hia ac
tions on Wednesday morning. This
meeting will be held in a day or so,
probably to-morrow."
All the talk on the campus at the
University of * California to-day con
cerned the fate of the eight students
caught roaming the streets - and hilla
on Charter day eve by Professor C. L.
Cc'i-y and his posse "of imported sleuths
from Oakland. To be or not to be,
that was the question. Will they "get
flied" or will they stay? 1 " Will the "fire
department," which is the other name
for the students' affairs committee,
turn' the hose of disgrace upon the un
lucky eight or will it overlook theic.
offense?
'But even Professor Cory wouldn't
answer any of these questions. And to
be sure he is the only one who knows.
The Oakland police do not presume to
be familiar with such affairs or on the
inside at all. Professor Cory even
withheld the names of the eight. The
only one that anybody really knows Is
that of .the fellow caught on Charter
Hill. - It is Joseph ijamson, a post
graduate.
It was understood that the eight had
been summarily dismiKsed immediately
after their arrest, but it transpired to
day that this is not so. They are all
to be given a trial before the students'
affairs! committee. "On the outcome of
that trial depends whether they stay
or not.

The First Unitarian Church closed
the fiscal year ending March 3 free
from debt and with a balance in the
treasury. At the annual meeting last
night the members of the Unitarian
Society were heartily congratulated by
Colonel John P. Irish, who presided at
the meeting, on the progress made dur
ing the last twelve months. The report
of Treasurer George Evans showed
that the receipts for the year were
513.432 33: the diabureements. $11. .8Â« 2o;
cash on hand, $1652 08. Deducting the
amount laid aside for the payment or
taxes, in case the Board of Supervisors
refuses to annul the bill of sale to the
State for taxes unpaid, leaves a cash
balance of $772 08.
The Rev. George W. Stone, field sec
retary of the American Unitarian Asso
ciation, who, since the resignation of
the Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills, has act
ed as pastor of the church, delivered an

free from debt, and advising that the
trustees be given added power in the
management of the church finances.

1118 Broadway, March 24.
The Oakland Transit Consolidated to
day rÂ»urrhased from J. H. Macdonald
the franchises for the street railroad
connections in East Oakland known as
the Fourth avenue cut-off, which were
included nith a College avenue fran
chise in the blanket purchase for $8300
Macdonald made three weeks ago in
the City Council, outbidding the Tran
sit Company.
The terms of the purchase of the cut
off franchise wi!l not be made public.
Attorney Harmon Bell, representing the
raUro&d company, said they were satis
factory to both side? and that the
formal transfer of the franchises to his
people would take place as soon as the
ordinance awarding them to Macdonald
had been passed and signed by the
Mayor.
This settlement insuros the immpdiatp
construction of the cut-off, which will
materially benefit the large section of
the east side known as Peralta Heights.
In fact, agitation by the improvement
club of that district since Macdonald
got control of the franchises led direct
ly to the action to-day that has re
lieved the citizens of their fears that
the important railroad improvements in
their* territory might be blocked.

Judge Seawell Takes Under Submis
sion Action of Mrs. Knox
Against John Lee.
John Lee is the defendant in a suit
for an accounting brought by Annie
Knox, widow of John A. Knox, which
was heard and taken under submis
sion by Judge Sea well yesterday. The
suit involves the sale of the Big Can
yon mine, of which at the time of his
death Knox was part owner. '
Lee, who was a stockholder in the
Big Canyon Mining and Milling Com
pany, which owned the mine, and of
whose stock Knox owned 42,975 shares,
besides holding a note of the company
for 515.718, sold the mine to Charles
D. Lane. Prior to the sale Mrs. Knox
was dissuaded from foreclosing on the
note by the statement of Lee that he
would see that she did not lose any
thing by her forbearance. He failed,
however, the widow alleges, to keep
his promise, hence the suit.
HEARS SUIT INVOLVING
TITLE TO BIG CANYON* MINE
bore the insinuation complacently and
answered that ordinarily he was not,
but in this case he said he felt entirely
justified. ,
William Rosello came tot the stand
for a moment, but was excused. He
occupied the room vacated- by Mrs.
Botkin at the Victoria Hotel in June,
1898, and is said to have found on the
floor a lump of what is, claimed to be
arsenic, which was turned over to the
police. The prosecution was not ready
to introduce proof of the character of
the substance at this time and Rosel
lo's testimony* will be recorded later.
NURSED MRS. BOTKIN.
Mrs Almirah Ruoff was the next and
last witness of the day. Her testimony
took up the remainder of the morning
session and all of the afterncun. She
first made the intimate acquaintance
of Mrs. .Botkin in 1897, when she
nursed her during a three weeks' ill
ness, although she had been intimately
acquainted with the defendant's sis
ter, Fanny, for many years. When
Mrs. Botkin was convalescent, witness
accompanied her to the home of Rev.
Mr. McClure in Oakland and remain
ed there as an inmate of the house
hold. Some days after their arrival
Mrs. Botkin told the nurse that John
P. Dunning would call that evening
and asked her to admit him to the
house without letting other members
of the family know of it. Dunning
called and was admitted and went to
Mrs. Botkin's rooiQ He called subse
quently and was admitted in the same
manner.
The next time Mrs. Ruoff saw Dun
ning and Mrs. Botkin together was at
927 Geary street. She had made ar
rangements to spend the night with
Mrs. Botkin and on going to the room
at 10 o'clock she was told by the de
fendant that she could not enter then.
She waited in the hall and eventually
was called by Mrs. Botkiri? In the
room she found Dunning and Mrs.
Botkin, who was dressed in a pink
wrapper. There was a bottle of whis
ky on the table. Once again she saw
Dunning and Mrs. Botkin together at
Golden Gate Park and once on the
street.
On July 28, 189S, Mrs. Botkin came to
witness' home in Stockton early in the
morning. Witness said that the de
fendant told her she had some dia
monds in pawn, and came to see if "the
governor," meaning Botkin, would re
deem them for her. That night Mrs.
Botkjn complained of feeling very ill,
and Dr. Stone was summoned to attend
her. She heard the conversations that
night and. the day following between
the doctor and Mrs. Botkin regarding
arsenic and strychnia, and related them
with much more minuteness of detail
than had the doctor himself. She told
what he had said to Mrs. Botkin re
garding the symptoms of arsenical poi
soning so thoroughly and readily that
Dr. Downs of Dover, with all his medi
cal knowledge, was outdone.
INQUIRED ABOUT ARSENIC.
The witness also testified that the
defendant had spoken j to her about
arsenic in relation to poisoning mice,
and asked her if she had any of the
poison. .Previously in a room at the
Victoria Hotel, then occupied by Mrs.
Botkio, the witness said that the de
fendant had asked her about" bleaching
a straw hat and whether or. not arsenic
was used for that purposed Mrs. Bot
kin also asked hoWHt- could be ob
tained, according to the witness. Dur
ing the stay at the Stockton home of
witness the defendant inquired about
sending a package through the mails
and what it cost. The witness informed
her, and â¢ told her that g no Â¦ package
weighing over four pounds could be
sent that way, whereupon the defend
ant said that the package would weigh
about a pound. Mrs. Ruoff said that
she advised Mrs. Botkin to have the
package registered, and that the latter
then Inquired if she would have to. sign
her name in order to register the pack
age. Defendant told : her, according to
the witness, that she wanted to send a
parcel up, north.
Mrs.', Ruoff was also interrogated at
length regarding Mrs. Botkin's -' hand
writing,- with which she claimed to be

familiar, having received twenty-five
or thirty letters from her. She der
scribed the handwriting as "very Eng
lish." She identified the note contained
in the box of poisoned candy as being
the writing of Mrs. Botkin, more espe
cially the signature, "Mrs. C." This
latter she was particularly positive
about, because the C- was framed in
quotation marks which were set diag
onally, the first at the top of the letter
and the second at the bottom. She said
this was an invariable custom of Mrs.
Botkin. Another specimen was a note
to Dunning written on the bottom of a
letter addressed to Mrs. Huoff, which
read, "Would that I could see you, my
love." The witness claimed to have
seen Mrs. Botkin write this, and it was
admitted as an exemplar of the defend
ant's handwriting.
IjITTTERS NOT ADMITTED,
Two anonymous letters addressed to
Mrs. Dunning at Dover and postmarked
San Francisco were- also recognized by
the witness as in Mrs. Botkin's hand
writing, but when the prosecution
sought ; to introduce them in evidence
as exemplars Judge Cook refused to
admit them. This was ?vn. unexpected
setback for the prosecution, and Dis
trict Attorney Byington was plainly
dismayed. All other exemplars of the
defendant's handwriting were likewise
rejected, but some of them may get in
at a future time by additional proof.
The anonymous letters, which are
supposed to have been written by Mrs.
Botkin. inform Mrs. Dunning of the re
lations existing between her husband
and the defendant. In one Mrs. Botkin
is described as "an interesting and
pretty woman," "interesting: to a de
gree," "a lady by birth and education."
It states that the pair are "leading a
quiet bohemian life," and abjures Mrs.
Dunning to break with her husband
entirely, as he is no longer worthy of
her regard. The letter is signed "Your
friend." The other explains that the
"financial embarrassments of your
husband during the winter were not
due to his speculations on the race
track," but because he was showering
his gold on "an English lady who is de
cidedly good-looking and interesting."
When Mrs. Botkin came to the Stock
ton home of Mrs. Ruoff on August 18,
after the story of her alleged crime
had been printed in the press, she
threw her arms around the nurse's neck
and .besought shelter in the name of
her sister Fanny. "For Fanny's sake,"
said the witness, "I will care for you."
According to Mrs. Ruoff, Mrs. Botkin
promptly went off into hysterics after
asking her to send for Dr. Stone.
ATTACKS IIEU CHARACTER.
Attorney . Knight took the witness
in hand for cross-examination with a
large outburst of sound and after a
tremendous -commotion among coun
sel he finally was ordered .by Judge
Cook to modulate his tones.
"Mrs. Botkin 'came to you on Aug
ust 18, 1898, did she not, and you took
her in?" he asked.
"I did," said the witness.
"Yes. you took her in. You're par
ticularly interested in this case, aren't
you?" *
"Not particularly. I'm a witness
and I came here to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the
truth." : j
"Didn't, you come Into the court
room with John P. Dunninsr when the
jury was being selected and sit here
and tell , the District Attorney what
jurors to select?"
"No, sir.' The District Attorney
asked me a question and I answered
it."
"Didn't you tell the District Attor
ney to excuse Mr. Mossf ord because
he was an Englishman and might vote
to acquit?" v
"I never said anything about- Mr.
Mossford." .
"What was the cause of the^rou
ble between you and Mrs. Botkin?"
"There. is no trouble. I have no un
friendliness for her."
"Wa.sn't it because she spoke to you
about being discharged from the
Stockton Insane Asylum for cruelty
to a patient?" . â¢
"No, sir; we Â¦ never spoke about
that."
"You were discharged as an attend
ant : at the insane asylum for cruelty
to God's insane, were you not?" '
"No, sir; I was discharged because
I had trouble ! with | the laundress."
: "You say that- you admitted Dun
ning'to the McClure home clandes
tinely on two occasions and kept the
secret?" t , ' >;,* .. - ; ;
- "Yes, sir." , .
,"At that time you were a member
of Rev. Mr. McClure's church and an
inmate of a- Christian home and still
made yourself a party to this unholy
liaison?". " 1 ; â¢
"I didn't know that there was'any
thing wrong with them." â¢â¢;
"How, large, was that house?"
"It was a i two-story frame build-
day she was lively and amiable, ex
cept at such times as Mrs. Ruoff's testi
mony aroused her, and then she would
utter a protest and whisper to her at
torney, Frank McGowan. Frequently
she smiled at the statements of her for
mer nurse and was ever ready with
suggestions as to pertinent questions
to be asked of the witness.
Both morning and afternoon sessions
there was a constant turmoil engen
dered by the spats between counsel far
.the opposing sides. Byington and Fer
ral were on their feet half a hundred
times to protest at the insulting tones
they claimed Knight used in his cross
examination of witnesses. Knight came
back readily with denials and denun
ciations, and everybody except Judge
Cock seemed to enjoy it. He repri
manded Knight twice and finally for
bade him to bellow his questions at
Mrs. Ruoff, who was then on the stand.
Thereafter Knight lowered his voice
and things went more, smoothly. But
he had his say beforehand.
â¢'I deny that my voice is other than
it should be. I am using a plainly
audible tone and not one of those
squeaky voices I hear from the other
side that sounds like a rusty hinge on
a barn or a cross between the yowl of
a pup and a cat."
Assistant District Attorney Ferral
was talking in the meantime. What
he said was lost "In Knight's tones for
the most part, but a protect from him
against "any more of this tin thunder
in this trial" floated out of the whirl
wind of sound and found rest in the
stenographer's notes.
Superior Judge Thomas J. Lennon of
Marin County sat with Judge Cook dur
ing the afternoon session and followed
the proceeding with much interest..
BREAKS INTO TEAKS.
Mrs. Isaac Tuchler was the first wit
ness of the day. In July. 1898, she was
Mrs. Grace Harris and clerked at the
City of Paris store. She. testified to
selling two handkerchiefs to Mrs. Bot
kin of character similar to the one
which was contained in the box of
poisoned candy received by Mrs. Dun
ning at Dover.. She was positive that
the defendant was the woman who
purchased â¢ the handkerchiefs. Mrs.
Botkin stood up during the identifica
tion at the request of Attorney Knight
and gazed defiantly back into the eyes
of the woman who was testifying
against her.
It was during the cross-examination
that Mrs. Tuchler gave way to tears.
Attorney Knight was going into her
varied matrimonial ventures. After
ascertaining the time and place of her
birth the attorney asked her if she had
been expelled from Notre Dame con
vent in San Jose. Judge Cook sus
tained an objection to the question.
The attorney then drew from the wit
ness that she came to thi3 city and en
gaged in the millinery business.
"What did yo\i do after that?"
asked Knight.
"I was married."
â¢"To whom?"
"To a man named Thomas Pierce."
"Is he alive or dead?"
"I don't know. I was divorced from
him."
Mrs. Tuchler was plainly on the verge
of tears and looked appealingly toward
Judge Cook, and Byington was pro
testing against what he' called the in
sulting tone of the counsel.
"After Pierce what was your name?"
persisted Knight remorselessly.
"Harris." answered the witness.
"Where is he?"
"He died in 1896."
"Were you living with him then?"
A torrent of tears burst from the wit
ness. "Mr. Knight," she sobbed, "you
are taking the advantage of me as a
witness in this case. You know I can't
protect myelf and I think It is cowardly
in you."
KNIGHT IS UNMOVED.
Byington and McGowan were on
their feet, shouting at each other, and
Knight was flouting the show of emo
tion on the part of the witness. "These
tearful plays don't buy anything with
me," he exclaimed. "I've seen too many
of them. Don't appeal to me for pro
tection; appeal to the court."
Order came about some way and the
witness, relieved by her outburst, went
through the remainder of her exam
ination aridly. The remembrance of
Mrs." Botkin was particularly impressed
on the witness because of the re
semblance the defendant bore to the
witness' mother and this resemblance
had been a subject of conversation 'be
tween the two at the time of the pur
chase. '..W v'.->
Dr. T. "W. Stone of Stockton, follow
ed the candy makers and told of hav
ing been called to treat . Mrs. Botkin
for grip on July 28, 1898, at the home
of Mrs. Ruoff in Stockton. In addition
to his visit that evening, he called
twice the following day- and at all
three interviews the defendant ques
tioned him concerning the effects of
the administration of arsenic. He said
he thought she was Joking and. told
her that If she contemplated suicide,
she would better take morphine, as it
was less painful. She persisted in her
queries concerning arsenical -and
strychnia poisoning and under her
questioning He detailed the effects of
the two poisons and told her the
amount that would prove a .lethal
dose.
Under cross examination Dr. â¢ Stone
said he had never narrated these con
versations until after the conclusion
of the first trial. . '. Attorney Knight
tried to embarrass the witness by ask
ing: him if he was in the habit of dis
closing conversations with patients,
held professionally, ?" but -the doctor
Mrs. Almirah Ruoff. a trained
nurse, traB the bright particular
star yesterday in the trial 4n
Jud*e Cook's court of Cordelia Botkin,
charged -with murder for the alleged
pending of a box of poisoned chocolates
from this city to Mrs. John P. Dunning
at Dover. Delaware, from partaking of
which Mrs. Dunning and her sister,
Mrs. Joshua D. Deane died. Mrs. Bot
kin is now on her second trial for the
murder of Mrs. Dunning.
'Mrs. Ruoff has been intimately con
nected with the incidents of the case
almost from the beginning of the liai
son between Mrs. Botkin and John P.
Dunning, husband of one of the mur
ere< l women, which is supposed to
have furnished the motive of the crime.
WAS A CONFIDANTE.
It was at Mrs. Ruoff s house that
Mrs. Botkin took refuge when the
newspapers first published the facts
which seemed to connect her with the
double poisoning, and it was there she
was taken into the custody of the law.
Mrs. Ruoff had nursed Mrs. Botkin
through an Illness during the year 1897
und accompanied her to the home of
Mr?. Botkin's .brother-in-law, Rev. N.
C McClure. then a resident of Oakland.
Here Mrs. Ruoff made her home for
Rome time and on two occasions admit
ted Dunning to the house, when he vis
ited Mrs. Botkin without the knowl
edge of other members of the house
hold.
One of the most important witnesses
introduced during the day by the pros
ecution was Dr. T. W. Stone of
Stockton, who grave testimony that in
July. 18SS, the defendant evinced unu
sual interest in the matter of arsenical
poisoning and obtained from him a full
statement at its action and effects. He
did not testify on the former trial.
Tears were one of the features of
the morning session. Mrs. Isaac Tuch-
J'T broke down under the cross-exam
ination of Attorney Knight and sobbed
painfully. She was a clerk at the City
of Paris store in July. 1S98. and claims
to have sold Mrs. Botkin two handker
chiefs of the same character as the one
received at Dover inside the box of
poisoned candy. She was positive in
nor identification of Mrs. Botkin de
spite her tears.
Mrs. Harry M. Campi. born Hoff
man, and once an employe of Haas
& Sons, and B. Eiken, likewise a for
mer employe of the candy establish
ment, completed the list of witnesses of
the day. The latter two merely de
tailed the method of manufacture of
chocolate candies and testified that no
ersenic cr other poisonous substance
vcre used therein.
DEFENDANT IS CHEERFUL.
Mrs. Botkin ypent the best day she
1ms had since the beginning of the trial,
from all outward appearances. Fhe ar
rived early at the Hall of Justice in
Â¦ -closed carriage, made the usual run
'at the elevator to avoJd the gaze of
Â¦the curious and was shot up from the
basement to the courtroom floor, al
most before any one knew she was in
â¢.he building. She was soon joined by
her sister, who always sits beside her
Â¦luring the hearings. Throughout the

r Byington protested* and -the court
ruled that the question was highly
improper.
"Did you drink anything on the
night you found Dunning and Mrs.
Botkin together in a room at 927 Geary
street?"
"Yes; I drank some whisky, toddy
with them."
"How many packages had you had
before you reached the room?"
Again Byington protested at the
language,' and Knight changed his
phraseology.
I'How many drinks did you take be
fore you reached the room that night?'-'
'-'Not a drop," said the witness ex
citedly, "not a single dr-op â not a sin
gle' dr-r-r-opâ not an eighth of " a
dr-r-r-r-op.'-'
"As a matter of fact, are you not
a habitual drunkard? When you ran
a millinery store in Stockton were you
not in the habit of locking, up the
place for days at a' time and going on
your- drunks?" - Â¦*" ,â¢;'
The witness denied these accusa
tions, saying that she had * never bren

that she had ever \ become so , drunk

â¢ "I have been under the influence, of
liquor, but I never got so far . over

Knight continued to pound along on
the' lines of intoxication until the wit
ness exclaimed:
"Mr. Knight, if I were a man you
wouldn't dare ask me these insulting
questions."

plaud, but the bailiff promptly sup
pressed her. Before this, there had

Failure
To cure indipestion is largely due to the
old theory that jirhen the stomach be-
comes inactive, it needs something to
mechanically digest its contents, and ca-
thartics, purgatives, etc.. are used, which
give only temporary relief, because they
digest by. irritating the lining of â¢ the
stomach. ' ". .â¢ Â¦ '
Modern science recognizes the fact
that it is the nerves that- furnishes mo-
tive power, to digest the contents of the
stomach. ,
-The nerves agitate and mix the food,
and stimulate the secretions. When they
become- weakened they lack energy, and
indigestion, dyspepsia, sour stomach re-
sult. '

|j 6a3 Market St., San Francisco, CaL k|Then occurs a gap between Powhattan and a pilgrimage
to Harvard College, for the biography states that "he
went to Harvard College." There occurs a structural
defect, for nothing is said about what he did when he
"went" or that he ever came back. The imagination is
left to leap and play in this break, and the tale jumps to
a religious statement to the effect that he follows the
faith of his fathers and was baptized in the Episcopal
church. The writer seehis to have regarded this as
needful of further evidence, and another leap is taken
from baptism to matrimony, and it is boldly proclaimed
that he was married at Grace Church, New York, by
Bishop Potter. ,
It seems, then, to nave occurred to the writer that
there must be logically some reason* given either for hav
ing the ceremony in such aristocratic surroundings, or
for its performance by the Bishop, and an explanatory
clause is interpolated to the effect that the Bishop "has
been his friend from boyhood." All that being happily
disposed of, his career as the publisher of aggressive
newspapers is pleaded and his "unflinching nerve force"
is weighed and measured. His virtues are circumnavi
gated and it is not forgotten to magnify them by the
statement that they have been subjected to sore and fre
quent temptation. â¢"'_
That they resisted is made plain, for "powerful influ
ences failed to move him." The reader is then led by
uneasy stages to the information that he risked his yacht
and his life on the firing line at Santiago and was "in the
thick of battle," with his own hands captured a dozen
prisoners, and magnanimously turned them over to the
United States, instead of keeping them for his own use.
Then the story declines to a more placid level, and de
clares that since his career of battle and of blood he has
"never owned a yacht," nor a stable, and "has never
owned a horse since those his father gave him soon after
he left college was sold." This. is excessively ambigu
ous. If we trust the pronominal adjective he was the
donee of several horses. If on the other hand we rely
on the verb he received only one horse. We regret this
uncertainty. The main thing the people want to know
about a Presidential candidate is, not merely whether be
is now indulging in the immorality of owning a horse,
but whether he refused to be corrupted by several horses
or resisted the blandishments of only one horse. ,It must
be remembered that all these things have to be thrashed
out in the campaign. Mr. Hearst puts his virtue on trial
by horse-power, and the people will want to know
whether it refused to budge when pulled by a team or a
single horse.
While on the subject of yachts, horses and means of
getting over the land and water, the biography partially
exhausts' it by lauding the skill of the candidate as a
chauffeur. He enjoys automobiling "as a diversion, but
has never taken part in a speed contest, as he considers
it dangerous and foolish." Here appears another of those
annoying vacancies. It is necessary that a candidate de
clare himself on the bicycle as weir as the automobile.
He cannot expect to get through the- canvass without
disclosing his views on the bicycle. No friend of the
plain people can sit inside of himself on that issue.
After declaring with commendable positiveness that he
demands that automobiles shall be sold cheap, so that
they can be enjoyed by the poor, the narrative proceeds
to an ineffectual attempt to describe his charms of man
ner. In speech he is quiet and convincing and avoids a
waste of words. ' His concentration is affirmed to be
marvefous. He considers only one thing at a time and
shoves out of his mind all things else and padlocks the
gate of thought until he has digested that one subject.
It is then released and the gates close on another. From
his intellectual Bastile nothing escapes until its bones
are picked. In his public speeches he is not a dealer "in
the flowers of poesy," and refrains from appealing to
prejudice and passion. It is intimated, however, ( that if
he chose he could move the very, stones to mutiny and
rage.
ANDIDATES for the Presidency, usually defer the
I expense of publishing a biography until after they
V^ arc nominated. We say "usually," from motives
of caution. Perhaps the statement could be, majje posi
tively that they have always waited until after nomina
tion. But there are candidates and candidates, and never
before has there been just such a candidate as Mr. Wil
liam Randolph Hearst, nor just such peculiar features as
make up his campaign for the nomination. Therefore,
let us marvel notUhat his candidacy has reached the'bio
graphical stage nearly four months before the nominat
ing convention meets.
We have been favored with a, copy of his biography,
perhaps autobiography is the more exact term, since the
work contains those intimate and personal revelations
which can only originate with himself. The title page is
ornamented with a picture of the American eagle, who
seems to be making a desperate effort to sit up and look
pleasant. Under the bird is a picture of Mr. Hearst,
with a turn-down collar, necktie and air of inscrutability,
and the titl<Â£ guarantees that the pamphlet contains "a
sketch of his life, describing his personality, his busi
ness capacity and his Democracy."
A perusal of the ensuing pages convinces us that the
gentlemen -who declaimed against him, at the recent
meeting of the Democratic State Committee, had not
read the little book, inasmuch as their descriptions dif
fered so radically from the disclosures it makes. He is
described as in his fortieth -year, tall of stature, broad of
shoulder and deep of chest. How can one overlook
these qualifications for the Presidency! In descent he
comes on the paternal side from South Carolina, and on
the maternal from the Randolphs of Virginia. This car
ries him back to Pocahontas and makes him of royal
blood, for his remote ancestor was King Powhattaii, and
raises the old feud between that royal person and the
Smith family.
POLITICAL BIOCxRAPHY.
A ravel blue book recently published j
shows that the health of the personnel \
in the 'British navy is steadily irr.prov- _
ing. Th<? total force afloat in 1902 was
95.C00 and the average number of men j
tick daily was 5523 39, a decrease of !
.02 per cent per 1000 compared with ,
VOl and vt 1.71 per cent in comparison j
v.'th the last five years. In the United ,
States navy the average strength of the j
Davy and marine corps was 31.240 fo*- j
lf'02. ashore and afloat, and the daily j
average of patirnts was only 1025.93.
A very interesting part of the above j
report is edited by Deputy Inspecto/
Gtneral T. D. Preston. R. X.. contain-,
ing extracts from naval medical 'offl- j
cÂ«_rs' journals from 1793 to 1856. In
JS23 a case of ophthalmia was "cured"
by the medical officer ordering the pa
tk-nt to be flogged. Another superin
tendent formed among the prisoners
themselves a "society for the suppres
sion of vice generally." and nominated
as president *"a saint with only ore
leg." A third surgeon proposed in 1825
that all convict ships should be fitted !
with "a trademill to work paddles sim
ilar to those of steam vessels and en
to propel the ship in calms." This
â¢trademill" was to be worked by thÂ«
prisoners.
One of the most notable references is
the following brief account of Admiral
Nelson's loss of an arm off Santa Cruz.
his treatment and his remarkably rapid
recovery: 'â¢Theseus, 1797, July 24 ami
2Z â Admiral Nelson â Compound fract
ure of the right arm by a musket ball j
passing through a little above the el

â¢ â¢ â¢
Two British torpedo-boat destroj-ers,
the Express and Arab, have been the <
cause of much trouble to their builders I
and the Admiralty. The Express was
built under contract of March 11. 1897,
to be delivered by October 4, 1S97. Its
contract speed was to be 33 knots, sub
ject to a penalty of $2500 for every one
quarter nr fraction of one-quarter knot
between SJ and 32 knots, and 55000 for
every one-quarter knot between 32 and
SI knots. The first trial took place Sn j
October. 1898, and between that time
and June, 1901, the vessel was/unsuc
eossfully tried thirty-seven times. It
vas /^hen decided to accept her at 31
knots and the final trial took place No
vember 14, 1901, the realized speed b?
ing 31.021 knots. The penalties for late
delivery footed up to $111,935 and $30,000
fine for reduced speed, both of which
were reduced to $10,000 and have been
paid by the contractor. In the opinion
of naval experts at the Admiralty the !
vessel's machinery must have deterio
rated considerable through the thirty
seven trials to obtain the required
Fpeed and the vessel was practically
old when finally delivered. The Arab,
vhich also failed to come up to the
guaranteed speed, cost the contractors
$15,000 in penalties.
The premium system has just been
introduced In the British Admiralty. It
xvas started about two years ago at
Carlisle under an agreement between
the Federated Engineering Employers
and the Amalgamated Society of En
gineers, and the system has been found
mutually satisfactory- Generally speak
ing it is a method by means of which
the workman receives pay for any tim?
he may save on a job. A time rate is
fixed for all work, such as punching,,
riveting and calking. The new cystem
vent into effect in the dockyards on
March 14 last.
Since William II became Emperor of
Germany in 1888 the navy has been in
creased by seventy ships, of 384,538 tons
displacement. Last year three battle-
Fhips, one armored cruiser, three cruis
ers and one. gunboat of a collective
tonnage of 59,477 were launched.
In 1902 five ships of 20,395 tons were
launched, and during 1901 the output
was eix ships of 57,150 tons.
The Russian naval estimates , for the
year beginning April 1 are considerably
Irss than for 190.3-4, being .113,622,4201
rubles. against 11C.321.241 rubles.
For shipbuilding and repairs 42,- 1
42$. Â£10 rubles were allowed a year 1
ago, but for the present year the esti
mates were cut down to 38,743,446 ru
blef. Recent disasters vj a number of
ccslly ships will materially increase the
low estimates.
The Russian cruiser Jembchug while
completing at the Xewski wharf broke
loose from her moorings and was car
ried nearly half a mile. up the river byi
the ice. It took a month's work of D90
men to cut a canal through the ice and ';
bring the vessel back to its proper*
place. !
The Russian navy personnel was ,
fixed two months ago at 22 vice ad- j
mirals, 25 rear admirals, 102 captains, j
C49 commanders, 900 lieutenants, 777^
sea cadets, 11 flag engineers, 140 senior!
cngineera, 202 engineers and 175 assist- '
ant engineers. There are no regularly '
appointed paymasters In , the Russian
navy. The duties are performed in a
fashion by the second officer in com
mand, which may account to a large
Jegree-'for the frequent scandals, which. Â¦
however, are not always from corrupt
practices, but due to" the unfamiliaiity
:Â»f the average line officer In any navy
tvith business methods.
A Swedish coast defense ship named
1 Manllgheten was launched last month j
i at Malmoe. It is a sister ship to the .;
Aeran, completed in 1S02. and is of 3650
tons, 2S2 feet in length. 49.2 feet beam
! and 16.4 feet draught. The armor belt j
I is of Krupi) steel, seven inches maxi
mum thickness, tap'ering to 4.? inches at j '

The personnel act of Congress in 1899 !
' excluded all officers retired before that '
' time from the benefits extended to f u- i
i ture retiring officers. The law as passed
! provided that such officers as had
; served during the war of the rebellion j
I were, upon retirement, to be advanced j
; one grade and receive the advanced |
1 pay. It was an unjust discrimination
j against those retired before March,
j 1?99, many of whom had been constant- j
! ly employed on dangerous service dur
Â¦ ing the four years of the war, while a
! large number of those retired since (
I March, 1S99, had seen but little active j
' war service. At the time this law was 1
1 passed $100,000 would have covered the 1
increase of pay to previously retired
war veterans, and the casualties among .
this number has decreased the sum to
570,000 at the present time. An effort is
being made to have this wrong righted,
the chief beneficiaries of which will be
I the widows, whose pensions, except in
j special cases, are inadequate toward a
decent support-
Troubles between the line and staff
corps in the United States navy have I
broken out again, and the line is the
aggressor this time. During the early
part of the present session of Congress
a bill recommended for passage by the
Secretary of the Navy was introduced
which eliminated the 15 per cent less
pay for shore service than at sea. It
had a very good chance of passing until
a staff officer discovered- that a para
graph in the bill, inserted by Captain
I Lemly, the judge advocate general of
I the navy, applied the benefit sought for
to line officers alone. This discovery has
naturally worked up the staff corps,
and the bill will be killed unless modi
fied so as to include all officers in the
navy.
Trans-Siberian Travel.
The passenger over the trans-Sibe
rian route may travel either by the
j Russian Government express or by
the train of the International Sleep-
Ing Car Company. The latter is a pri
vate corporation maintaining a ser
vice en the Continent and across Si
beria and Manchuria, with terminals
at Dalny, . Vladivostok and even Pe
king, which. In its general excellence,
can be compared only with the best
American trains." The traveler in Eu
rope finds that the first-class service
on most trains means a small car on
four or six wheels, with compartments
resembling very closely the stage
coach of our grandfathers. To be
confined in such close quarters for a
long distance would be almost unbear
able. The ordinary type of the Amer
ican Pullmari would likewise become
wearisome after some days. One tire's
of continued packing and unpacking,
of undressing in a sitting posture on
one's bed, or standing in the aisle
wrapped about with the curtain, in a
space not much more commodious
Â¦ than that afforded by astraltjacket.
The, service at present consists of
] eix classes of trains. We may-men
Â¦ tion first the "train de luxe Siberien,"
which will run once a week between
Warsaw and Dalny, via Moscow, and
will connect with the northern ex-
press now running between London..
Paris. Berlin land Warsaw. This train
will offer the quickest service between
all European points and the Far East.
Passengers from London will be met
at Ostend, on the Belgium side of the
English channel, by a representative
of the International Sleeping Car
Company familiar with all the prin
cipal languages, who will escort them
aboard a special car of the train de
luxe service, which will convey them
to Warsaw, where change to the
through train will be made without
loss of time. Passengers from Paris
will be likewise cared for by a through
car to Warsaw. No change of cars
will be necessary until Lake Baikal is
reached. At this point passengers will
change to a train the exact counter
part of the one they have just vacat
ed and will occupy the same coupes
in the new train. Porters supplied
by the company will make the change
of baggage, including hand baggage,
at no inconvenience, as it will necessi
tate merely the crossing of a platform.
Until the completion of the railway
I around Lake Baikal, passengers will
cross this very picturesque body of
water by steamer. Dalny, the South
Manchurian terminal, will be reached
without further change of cars, and
the entire journey from Xondon or
Paris will require about fourteen and
a half days, and to Peking only a few
hours more.
I The train de luxe will consist of
! first-class cars only, ai\d will be made
I up of a baggage car, two sleeping
cars, a dining car and a drawing room
! car. The latter will contain two or
j three large "cabins de luxe," contain
ing each, a brass bedstead' and a toilet
room, and will have in addition a
I large general drawing-room, contain
i ing piano, library, writing desk, with,
j at the rear, an open end for observa-
I tion purposes. There will also be in
j the train a bathroom, which will con
i tain gymnasium paraphernalia. In
I summer the Â¦ cars will . be . cooled' by
electric fans and In winter heated by
steam, , and the lighting will be by
electricity. An extra charge is made
' for this train, but it is calculated that
i the fare from Paris to Dalny or Pe
king will not exceed $2 SO, Including
the cost of sleeper, food and incidental
expenses. It was the" intention. to put
this train, in service during the com
ing summer.â The Century for April.

I do not advocate lynching, but ask
you for some better way since our laws
are as utterly Inefficient for the pun
ishment of the guilty as they have
proved to be. Every one must admit
that mob law is a terrible expedient,
a dreadful alternative. If its only ob
ject was to wreak vengeance on the
guilty It could not be Justified or ex
cused; but, if it is to terrorize ether
evil doers and deter them from similar
crimes. the case looks different. I feel
sorry for the murderers who are
lynched, sorrier for the innocent 10,000
who await death from the assassins
yearly in the United States.
,If the career oÂ£ the. notorious out
law Tracy had been ' cut short when
he killed his, first man nine more men
might be alive to-day. If Dr. Holmes,
electrocuted in. New York, had been
executed when he killed his first vic
tim' twenty-five other people, by his
own confession, might be yet living.
In a recent year the Youth's Com
panion of Boston kept statistics of the
ghastly homicides done in the United
States and the "adequate" (?) punish
ments for the same. These are the
shameful figuresâ 10,652 murders, 122
legal hangings and 190 lynchings. I
hold that nothing justifies the taking
of human life but self-defense, and per
haps there were 652 cases of that out
of the 10,652 murders. If the remaining
10,000 murderers had been hanged, either
legally M or, if that were Impossible, ille
gally, do you think that there would
have been 10.000 more homicides in the
following year, as there were, lacking
a fraction? . Â¦'*Â¦'-"â¢
Editor of The Call â Dear Sir: In
your article against lynch law, evi
dently written with humane intent, in
the issue of the 22d inst. you make
statements and reach conclusions
wholly unjustified by facts stubborn
as they are regrettable.
You say that "in every case of lynch
ing the law would have dealt adequate
punishment." In the matter of homi
cides it has scarcely done it in one
case out' of a hundred. Again you say
that "lynching proves to be no restraint"
upon criminals." The contrary is strict
ly true; it is almost the only restraint.
The homicide does not fear the law.
He wants to get to jail for protection
at the earliest possible moment. We
have had about thirty murders in
Shasta County since a man was hanged
by law for. a crime. Some go free and
others go to an excellent home with
good board, in a healthy climate for a
vacation of about five yearsâ a rather
pleasant change.

Carnival of Homicides.
A company has been formed In South
America to exploit the real El Dorado.
This is a lake situated in the territory
of Colombia, near Bogota, and the story
is that the chief of the state in pre-
European time3 used, twice a year, sol
emnly to empty a boatload of gold into
the water in order to purchase the par
don of the gods for the sins of his
people during the previous six months.
This ceremony is said to have been reg
ularly carried out for several centuries,
and it is therefore calculated that the
value of the accumulated treasure must
amount to many millions of pounds.
Consequently If everything goes as the
prospectus predicts the company should
pay enormous dividends, and the United
States of Colombia should be more than
recompensed for the loss of the republic
of Panama.
The Real El Dorado.
One hot, dusty day, I was driving.
The team was slower, if possible, than
usual. I had exhausted all my per
suasive pow.ers to encourage it to
nobler efforts, but without success.
Finally, in desperation, I offered up a
blessing upon the heads of those two
mules and in disgust shouted that I
could buy them both for fifteen cents.
Well sir, as I am alive, one of those
brutes actually turned his head, and
looking me straight in the eye, said:
" 'Haw-he-e-e-haw-haw!'
"I maintain that it was a pure coin
cidence and that he was- hungry, but
the boys won't have it, and say he un
\ derstood me perfectly, and gave me
the horse laugh. Believing they in
tend to tell the story on me, I have de
cided to beat them to it."
"Last season," said Leon Reynolds,
leader of an Oakland theater orches
tra, "I went with the boys of the or
chestra camping through Mendocino
County. We hired a wagon and two
pocket editions of the mule tribe. I
mention the wagon first because I
have nothing against it. It almost
seemed to be first in the going, any
way. The- mule is nqt well known to
the general public. He doesn't care a
snap of his foot for that, however â
neither does the public. When hungry
the animal has a funny call; not the
awful sound like tearing a rag, but

REPORTS submitted at the third annual meeting
, of the executive committee of the Carnegie trust
for the universities of. Scotland show that the ef
fect of the practical operation of the policy inaugurated
by the founder of the trust has been even more widely
beneficial than was expected. It has led by a natural se
quence of events to. an improvement of the whole sys
tem of Scottish education, and it is not unlikely the in
fluence will be felt even in England itself.
The direct and immediate result of the grant of aid
to university students was a large increase in the number
of applicants. To guard against the possibility of an ex
cessive number the standard of qualification for admis
sion to the universities was raised. . That in turn has led
to an advancement of the standards of instruction given
in the high schools. Thus from one department of the
system of public education to another the influences of
the gift have been diffused until now almost every section
of Scotland enjoys some benefit from them.
The total income derived from the trust amounts in
round numbers to $500,000, and of that amount upward of
$250,000 is allotted for payment of university fees for de
serving students. Last year something like $220,000 of
that sum was claimed and paid out, so that it is clear
something must be done to check the demand. The
trustees have decided to raise the standard of admission,
especially in the medical schools, and it is expected a fur
ther elevation of the standard will be made in the near
future, so that Scottish universities will ere long hold 1
very high rank so far as the standards of matriculation
are concerned.
Of the students directfy benefited by the fund the re
port of the executive committee says: "The number of
beneficiaries for the winter session 1903-04, under the
system of paying students' fees, is 3027, an increase of
160 over the number for the previous winter session. The
cost was Â£30,510 153, and as during the summer session
of 1903 the payments for 1755 students had amounted to
Â£13,569 12s id, the total for the two sessions under this
head has been Â£44,080 7s. The comnmtee record with
pleasure that six' students have during the year volun
tarily refunded the fees paid for them by the trust to tha
amount of Â£72 2s."
In addition to the aid given to students the universi
ties derive of course other benefits from the sums
granted annually toward the maintenance of libraries,
the construction of new buildings, the equipment of
laboratories, the granting of scholarships and funds for
original research. Of such grants during the past year it
is said: "For library purposes each university has re
ceived Â£1000, and Â£2400 has been allowed for provisional
assistance; but a large part of the grants offered for
buildings and permanent equipment and for teaching
endowments remains unclaimed. The committee, how
ever, expect that during the current year expenditure
under these heads will be considerably increased. The
grants already claimed for building and equipment
amount to Â£7725. Among other sums paid ore Â£6200
toward teaching endowments and Â£1828 for five fel
lowships and fifteen scholarships, with grants of varying
amount to fifty applicants. The outlay under this latter
head for the academic year 1903-04 is estimated at Â£3524,
of which the remainder will be paid this year. The trust
has purchased for Â£10,000 the laboratory of the Royal
College of Physicians of Edinburgh, on the understand
ing that the College of Physicians and the College of
Surgeons continue their present respective annual con
tributions; two representatives of the trust are added
to the laboratory committee. This is in connection with
the trustees' scheme for the endowment of post-graduate
study and research."

have been made for the beautification of San Francisco

I took no part in the lynching of

which took place in Redding some years
ago, but I have never heard a good
citizen say that he was sorry the deed
had been done. Its good effects wer*
apparent. It is the only thing crimi
nals fear. They have no dread of the
"good boarding-house" in San Quentin
or Folsom; it is as good a home as a
lazy man wants. My soul is sick to
the point of disgust when I see the
apathy of the public to the carnival of
crime in our midst. Evidently our Jury
system should be revisedâ nine men
should give a verdict in every case and
no appeal should be allowed except for
the admission of new evidence.

Chief Crowley was so delighted that
he granted Conboy a month's leave of
absence and on his return made him
a sergeant of police.
A capture of 53000 worth ; of
smuggled opium in Chinatown at 4
o'clock one cbSd, wet morning was
considered at the time. of its occur
rence to be one of the neatest Jobs
accomplished by a single police officer
in the history of the department. This
capture was made by Officer Michael
Joseph Conboy, now a lieutenant in
the police force. Conboy received a
handsome reward from the Federal
Government for the capture and the
thanks of the Treasury Department in
Washington. .
At the time of the incident Conboy
was doing patrol duty in Chinatown.
One old, jiried-up Mongolian on Com
mercial street was profuse in his
praise of the gentle manner in which
the officer performed his duty. Time
and again he would invite the patrol
man into his store and treat him to
a choice brand of cigars. On one. oc
casion *ie offered him a present in
money, which was declined with
thanks.
The witty officer came to the con
clusion that the Chinaman's gener
osity had a motive behind it and to
arrive at this he decided to keep a
sharp lookout' on the store. The in
coming of a tramp Chinese steamer
gave Conboy the tip to keep his eyes
open. He therefore hid himself on
the veranda of a store opposite the
Chinaman's place 1 on the night in
question. About 3:30 a. m., when the
wind was howling at the rate of forty
miles an hour and the rain coming
down in torrents, an express wagon
turned the corner of Kearny street
and drove up Commercial," where it
stopped In front of the Chinaman's
store. The cunning Mongolian was up
waiting the arrival and as soon as the
wagon stopped the iron doors were
thrown open and six boxes were has
tily carried from the wagon and de
posited behind a tier of tea chests-
Just then Conboy stepped into the
surprised circle, seized the contraband
opium and arrested the driver and the
cunning Chinaman.

prison population increases every year, and every year
our prisons discharge upon the community thousands of
unreformed men." Each of , these becomes a center of
corruption of others, a missionary of crime, unless the
community take charge of him and leave him no excuse
for living by offenses* against others. It is a serious
question, with many appalling features, but few men
think seriously of it, and" most of the efforts to meet it
are merely theoretical, when some practical plan is
granted the chance.
Penology is beginning to grow weaker on the subject
of the use of prisons as reformatories. By law most of
the State penitentiaries are forbidden to have industries
in which convicts may learn a trade, and get the reform
atory effects of occupation. Idleness is evil, in prison
and out,'' and is the most effectual bar to reform. Our
part of the -employer, and offered every opportunity to
lead , a right life to the man. But it was vain, for .he
proves to be a recidivist, and has robbed the man who
gave him the opportunity to live honestly.
Such cases are sad, for they prove that there exists
in some men a criminal instinct that is like an incurable
disease. Its presence can only be known by experiment,
and no one should be (deterred from helping the next ex
convict to live honestly because the last one failed. We
are sure that the philanthropic gentleman whose confi
dence has been betrayed will not refuse to help another
on that account. As experiment only can detect the
recidivist, the indeterminate sentence, especially for
crimes against property, is a proper policy. Such sen
tence with the parole system protects the man who has
yielded to temptation and has not in him the germ of
chronic criminality, and it affords the mean3 of sifting
out the recidivists from those who will live honestly if

audited. The price of jute bags was
fixed at $5 40 and the limit to be sold
to any one individual purchaser was
fixed at 5000 baes.
A representative of the Central Gas
and Electric Corporation was present
to explain the doubling of the light
bill for San Quentin prison during the
last month. The ordinary bill for
lighting ia $500. Last month it was
raised to $1200. The light company
promised to look into the matter and
rectify the bill if wrong and if not to
show the board why the price had
been raised.
Matters relating to the establish
ment of a light and power plant at
Folsom prison were discussed, but
nothing definite was done. Prison Di
rector Fitzgerald said that if the pris
on at San Quentin was to pay $1200
a month for light the prison board
would install Its own lighting plant.

PRISON DIRECTORS FIX
PRICK OF JUTE BAGS
Peter Nagle Sr. filed an affidavit in
the proceedings, in which he averred
he would have asked for the appoint
ment of an attorney to defend the
suit but for the fa'ct that Judge Cof
fey, when he came into court, refused
to give him a hearing.
Charles J. Nagle of the Nagle law
offices lost a little bit of his practice
in Judge Coffey's court yesterday. He
was relieved of the arduous duty of
defending the estate of Elizabeth
Boyne against a suit for the foreclo
sure of a mortgage brought by Dr.
H. C. Conradt. To Attorney W. F.
Humphrey was given the task, he
having shown that Xagle had been
lax in his duty as attorney for the ex
ecutor of Mrs. Bo3 - ne's will.
The history of Xagle's connection
with the estate of Mrs. Boyne is de
cidedly interesting. Some time prior
to her death Mrs. Boyne gave James
Nagle a note for $2500, securing its
payment by a mortgage on realty.
Upon her death she left a wiir-vjn
which James Nagle is named as ex
ecutor, devising her property to rela
tives in Ireland, several religious in
rtitutions. Rev. P. C. Yorke. Rev. H.
H. Wyman and Rev. Terence Caraher.
It was after the will was admitted to
probate that the note came into evi
dence. In Judge Cook's court Peter
Nagle Sr., father of James, to whom
the note had been assigned, presented
it as a claim against the estate. James
admitted, as executor, that the note
was a valid one and Judge Cook ap
proved it. On learning that James
Nagle, the executor of Mrs. Boyne's
will, had an interest in the note para
mount to that of his father, the hold
er of the note, he set aside his ap
proval and disallowed the claim.
After this proceeding Nagle senior
took the note over to Oakland, where
he assigned it to one Thomas "Moran.
Moran held it for a while and then
assigned it to Dr. H. C. Conradt. who
brought a suit to have the mortgage
foreclosed.
" Fathers Wyman. Yorke and Cara
her feared judgment by default would
be obtained against the estate, for
Charles Nagle, brother of Executor
James Nagle. ! whose attorney he is
and son of Peter Nagle Sr., took no
steps to defend the estate against the
suit. The clergymen retained Lent &
Humphrey to look after their inter
ests, with the result that James Nagle
was cited to r^oear to show cause
why he did not* obtain the services of
an attorney to defend the sut
At the hearing of the order yester
day it was very apparent that the Na
icle family. James, Charles and Peter
Sr.. did not stand, very well in the
court. Charles Nagle was placed on
the witness stand and started to ex
plain his connection with the case, but
the court decided that no explanation
was needed and granted, after a very
short session, the petition for the ap
pointment of a lawyer to defend the
suit. : ,
According to the bank's complaint
Purrington was simply the tool of At
torney George D. Collins and Charles
H. Robinson, one of the heirs of the
Robinson estate. The bank alleged that
In order to defraud it out of its interest
in property on Howard street, near
Twenty-second, part of the Robinson
estate, Collins and Robinson procured
the appointment of Purrington as ad
ministrator. Then, it was alleged, Rob
inson and Collins filed a suit against
the estate for a claim of $2700 put for
ward by Robinson. Judgment was ob
tained by default, Purrington failing to
appear and defend the suit, with the
result that Robinson obtained a lien
upon realty already the property of the
bank. All knowledge of the bank's
claim, it was alleged, was fraudulently
concealed from the court.
The suit of the Hibernia Bank for
the remboval of C. W. Purrington as
administrator of the estate of the late
Caroline Robinson was decided by;
Judge Coffey yesterday, and an order
removing Purrington was made. In the
findings of the court it was not decided
that Purrington had been guilty of the
charges of conspiracy and fraud pre
ferred against him by j the bank, but
simply that he was "guilty of negli
gence of so grave a character that his
removal was Justified."
This settlement practically leaves un
disturbed all the provisions of C!unie's
Â¦will except the clauses pertaining to
the residue. Mrc. Clunie will retain the
Sacramento property devised to her
ar.d the family homestead. The title to
the warehouse property in Sacramento
Is vested in Andrew Clunie. and Jack
Clunie is the owner of the Clunie build-
Ing In this city.
â¢ At the re^uc-ft of Andrew J. Clunie
the petition of the trustees of the estate
of his brother, Thomas J. Clunie, for
partial distribution to them of the trust
created in Clunie's .will for the benefit
of "Jack" Clunie. the adopted son of
the deceased, was stricken from the
calendar yesterday. This action is the
final step in bringing to an end the con.
tost of the will of Clunie warred for a
time by the former Congressman's
widow, and Is* a confirmation of the
compromise effected between the widow
and the heirs some weeks ago.
Under the compromise Mrs. Clunie
will receive 5150.000 besides the realty
devised tt* her in the will, making her
interest in the estate worth about $450,
000. Of the JliO.OOO she gained by her
contest $115,000 will come from the half
of, the residue of the estate bequeathed
to Jack Clunie, the balance to be paid
by Andrew Clunie, to whom was de
vised the other half of the residue.
After deducting from the estate the
portions devised to the children of An
drew Clunie and to his brothers, there
will be left about $750,000 for Andrew
and Jack Clunie. The boy will receive
cut of this sum about $500,000 and An
drew the balance.

M. Aubert. the landlord's agent and
the manager of the tenement house,
snys it is not so much a question cf
rent as of the trouble the helpless old
man makes. "His habitB are filthy and
we are constantly in dread of his start
ing a fire in his rooms, where he in
sists on trying to cook."
An inspection of the room confirmed
Aubert's statement. The place was full
of old boxes and other Junk, and on a
table, in tho midst of the Utter, stood
two oil cans. Old Louis insisted that
he was always careful in lighting his
fire, but It is probably luck that has
saved him from burning himself up be
fore this. Aubert, however, consented
to his remaining until to-day in order
that friends who are trying to find a
place for the old man may save him
from the Almshonse.
Old Louis Pontillo, once a familiar
figure on the streets of the Barbary
Coast, where for half a century he told
fortunes and peddled wares of the-
Cheap John sort, Is to be evicted this
afternoon from the squalid rooms at
605 Broadway that have known no
other tenant during the last" twenty
five years. Blind now and fallen on
evil days, the apred Mexican has not
been able to pay his rent for six months
and yesterday a writ of possession was
issued by Justice Van Xostrand. di^
rectinsr the Sheriff to eject the impov
erished fellow in default of payment of
$24 due to his landlord, P. Marsicano,
the rich salt manufacturer and real
estate owner. To these arrears of rent
is added the sum of $4 costs of the
proceedings. Pontillo can pay neither
the $4 nor the $24. "I am busted, sure,"
says he.
The old man was born in the City of
Mexico seventy-five years ago, accord
ing to his own story, but he looks even
older. He came to California at the
age of fifteen and remembers San
Francisco when it was merely a mis
sion settlement and the argonauts had
not begun to dream of it. For a quar
ter of a century he has been paying $4
a month for the use of the same room
in the tenement-house wnich he must
now leave. Five years ago his eyu
sight began to fail him and he is bare
ly able to distinguish light from dark
ness. A woman: did It, says old Loui*
"No. I dare not tell you her name,'
he protested, trembling at the very
notion. "Why, she would kill me at
once if I told who she was. She thougnt
I was rich and said if I did not give
her money she would make me blind.
She wouldn't believe that I had noth
ing, and so she bewitched me. Now I
can hardly see at all. v
"They want to turn me out of my
room, but I won't go. They'd like to
send me to the Almshouse. They kill
people down. there and I am not ready
t<i be killed. So I am Just going to
stay here. No, I cannot pay the rent,
but I have been paying rerit so long
they ought to let me stay here till I
die."

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
24. â The class of 1905 began the cele
bration of Junior day this evening with
the presentation of the junior farce in
Assembly Hall. The play, a musical
comedy, was written by Merle H.
Thorpe. : '05, and is entitled "The Man
From Mizzoury." The . production was
a success and reflected considerable
credit on the author. Local color and
clever songs added spice to the comedy
and. in- fact its merit depended largely
on those elements.
The play centered around the attempt
of Charley Hardrun, the man from
Mizzoury, to "cut a wide swath in- the
Stanford social world on an allowance
of ?25 per month.' While endeavoring
to do this he Incurs a large indebted
ness, his father comes out to visit him
and complications follow. From the^e
difficulties he is extricated by
James Easystreet, a college chum.
"While the title role was very well
taken by ."Al Trowbridge ("05) E. R.

IN IXGLKSIDE PARK STAKE
LOS ANGELES. March 24. â Dillon
did not play, but Los Angeles won the
first game of the season from Oakland
to-day by a score of 4 to 3. The crowd
of 3000 that went to Chutes Park this
afternoon certainly got the worthâ of
the admission price.' They saw the
championship pennant for last season
hoisted by Mayor Snyder, attended by.
the two teams of ball players; watched
the city's chief executive pitch the first
ball, waited half an hour at the end of
the fourth inning for the rain to cease
and witnessed one of the most exciting
and stubbornly contested games ever
played on therMiome diamond. Los
Angeles Won because they batted
harder and earned their runs. With
an apparently safe lead in the open
ing of the ninth inning, two bases on
balls, an error and a hit came near
giving the victory to Oakland.
Both teams did fine work, but the
fielding of Deveraux of Oakland and
Flood, of Los Angeles overshadowed
the rest of it. Newton pitched in his
best form and struck out seven of the
opposing batters. Schmidt, however,
was hit by Flood, Ross, Smith and
Newton.
Oakland scored the first run in the
fourth on a triple by Dunleavy and an
error by Flood. Los Angeles went one
better in the last half of the fourth on
a double and a single and a base on
balls. They made one more in the
fifth on a double and a single and an
other in the eighth oh two singles and
an error by Schafly. Oakland went to
bat in the ninth needing three runs to
tie. Two bases on balls, an error by
Spies and a hit gave them two, but the
side was retired by a remarkably, fine
bit ofNlelding by Flood. Score:

â¢ FRESNO, March 24.â On account
of rain, the baseball season opening
between the Tacoma and Portland
teams, scheduled for to-day, was post
poned until to-morrow.
Devereaux and Flood Are
the Stars of the
Opening Day.
The boxers will- weigh in at 6 o'clock
at Harry Corbett's, and a big crowd is
expected to congregate on Ellis street,
The boys will fight straight Marquis
"Of Queensberry rules. They will break
at the order of Referee Graney and will
protect themselves in the breakaway.
A record-breaking crowd will witness
the .fight. It is expected that every
ticket will be disposed of and that many
would-be spectators will be turned
away. The new pavilion is an ideal
place in which to hold a fight, as a good
view of the ring can be had from every
seat.
Although he has' apparently been
working hard to make the weight
there is a shrewd suspicion that it is
not 130 pounds he is having some dif
ficulty in making, but a notch several
pounds lower. He is aiming at this
weight, as he knows when he makes
it he will be fit to go any route.
The future ring careers of both boxers
hinge on the outcome of the battle. The
winner will be hailed as the prospective
lightweight champion of the world, as
there seems to be no 133-pound man in
sight who can lower the colors of
either.
His opponent is the ! champion
feather-weight of the world. He has
lost but three fights in four busy
years, although - he has taken some
desperate chances by going into, the
ring without proper preparation. He
knows Britt's quality and has taken no
chances this time. No boxer ever
stepped into a ring in better condition
than he will be in to-night.
CORBETT AT WEIGHT
Young Corbett and Jimmy Britt will
meet in Woodward's Pavilion to-night
In what gives promise of being the
most sensational fight between little
men ever waged in America.
One of the contestants has never
known what defeat meant either in
his amateur days. .or in the two years
in which he has appeared in the pro
feBSional ring. He has done all that
has been asked of-him in the past and
unless something- goes amiss before he
enters the ring to-night he will be in
better condition .than at any time in
his brief but brilliant career.
"I was never in better condition and
I know I will win," said Young Cor
bett at his training quarters at Shee-
Brltt's training work was completed
yesterday. He is "down to weight and
during the afternoon just raised the
scale bar at 130 pounds. His trainer.
Spider Kelly, then said. "That's
enough, Jimmy. Take it easy now and
bottle up steam for the fight." Britt's
only exercise yesterday at his quartern
In Alameda was a short spin on th;
road in the morning. He did nothing
in the afternoon heavier than tip tho
beam at the required weight and then
lounged about and exchanged greetings
with the many friends who visited the
little glove warrior's camp to obtain
a last look at him before he goes inco
action. -Without exception they wero
highly pleased with hi3 form and it
was* the general expression of tlw
critics that he. is in better condition
than he was before any of his former
ring battles.
With; Spider Kelly, Frank Rafael and
others Britt will come across the bay
this afternoon and will be at Corbett's
at 6 o'clock to fulfill his part of the
agreement with respect to the weight.
Before coming over Jimmy will go for
a brief â¢ spin on the road and that will
be ail the exertion he will make until
the fray Is on.
CHAMPION" IS COXFIDEXT.
The betting was brisk yesterday, each
boxer having many admirers. The Den
ver champion had the heaviest bettors
behind him and the pressure of money
Gnally made him a SV2 to 10 choiot.
There is a flood of Britt money which
would go in if the betting reached 2 to 1.
Harry Pollock, Young Corbett's man
ager, arrived from New York yesterday
and expressed surprise at the prevail
ing odda. He had some commissions
from friends of Corbett in New York,
but they expected at least 8 to 10 for
their money, according to Pollock. Thf
latter offered to bet $1000 against 52000
that Corbett would win in twelve
rounds and $1000 at even money that
Corbett would win in seventeen rounds.
BAITING IS BRISK.
as many will be anxious to catch a
glimpse of the little gladiators In their
street attire.
: There has been some doubt enter-
I tiiined aa to Corbett's weight and the
! fact that on the eve of the contest he
worked an hour in the grymnasium
clad in two suits of underwear and
two sweaters in order to perspire free
ly caused some of the spectators to
think that heroic measures were
necessary to get him down to weight.
Harry Tuthill, the veteran, trainer, un
der whose watchful eyes Corbett haÂ«
worked, declared that his man would
be well under weight by bedtime.
With pardonable j>Â«ternal, pride, J.
H. Rothwell, Corbett's father, has no
doubt as to his son's ability to retain
the title of champion. The following
dispatch was received yesterday from
j him at\ Denver: "'Son, go In to win,
pound for pound. Nothing to it. Your
papa, J. H. R."
Corbett was out bright and early yes
terday morning for roadwork and also
spent some time in the gymnasium. Ha
rested until 3 o'clock and then put in
another strenuous hour in the gym. As
usual there was a large crowd on hand
to see him work. For twenty minutes
he tugged at the weights ahd then
spent an equal length of time at the
swinging bag. The punching bag: next
occupied his attention, after which he
indulged in several rounds of shadow
boxing. His footwork was excellent.
Exercise for the muscles of the back
and abdomen completed the afternoon's
work. Not wishing to take any chances
of injuring his hands he did not don
the mitts. A vigorous rubdown fol
lowed and his trainers expressed them
selves as thoroughly satisfied with the
condition of their charge. Corbett per
spirrd profusely, but did not appear
fired. He made a most favorable im
pression on a host of sporting men
present.
The little fellow, accompanied bv
Harry Tuthill, Tim McGrath and Ben
Garson, will leave Sheehan's at 4
o'clock this afternoon.
nan's Beach Tavern, yesterday after
noon. Ther*Â» is no doubt the little
champion has been properly trained
for what is regarded as the hardest
fight in his career. If the redoubtable
j "James" v.rests the championship
I laurels from him it cannot be attribu
| ted to lack of condition.
When Umpire Jack McCarthy shrilly
cried "Strike one" on old George Van
H&ltren yesterday afternoon, the fans
realized that the beloved season of
baseball was here once more. The same
Â«ld chorus Â«f yells arose from the |
bleachers, the same old crowd >\vu>
gathered in the stands and everything
Â«t Recreation Park looked natural
; once more.
The old tradition made good again,
just as it has donÂ« for years past. San
Francisco won the first game of the
season, won it by the hair-raising
score of 1 to 0. It wa? the best' cur
tain-raiser that ever happened here,
for there was nothing but baseball In
it from the start.
Under an azure bluÂ» sky the season
was ushered in. Everything locnted
promising, even the home team. More
than 400U fans withstood the biting
winds, and, although they were coid
in body, their enthusi.'^m was .worked
up when San Francisco scored, and
after that time their interest never
lagged.
' Xo procession nor other demonstra
tion marked the ushering in of the sea
Â«on of 1904. There was no preliminary
skirmishes, but as soon as' the timefor
action arriv<?d.Joe Copeland, the "hu
man megaphone," strutted proudly out
into the center of the lot. and, removing,"
his bonnet, told those present thut
Hughes and Whalen would, .oppose
each other in the box, Blankenship. and
Leahy behind the bat and that Jack
McCarthy would call 'em when they
ca me over.
The stands and bleachers resounded
with a ring of real enthusiasm when
that veteran of many a diamond battle,
George Van Haltren, walked up to thÂ°
plate and got ready to line out the
first one that sn.!ledup. -The old .man
responded with a doff of his cap and
later by driving the sphere right into
the mitts oi Claude Schmeer.
When Seattie had been retired in tha
first inning and it came time for the
home players to take a turn with-th:Â«
bat, the crowd yelled and did all kinds
of happy stunis. As the players ad
vanced to the bat. looking like a fash
ion plates in the new white suits Uncle
bought them, each was given "a* hand
end encouraged to hit the ball a mile.
It was a game that was worth the
price. For Jive innings everything thai
came along^was smartly smothered "toy
the fielders and not'a run showed. San
Francisco awoke from its Ieth2rgy dur
ing a hot mix-up- in the eixth inning.
Jimmy Whalen was sent in with the
*>nly run of the. game and for the time
being he was a real. hero.
W*rtdron, the new centerfielder .whom
Unfle imported from Canada, made an
impression a foot deep with, the ; fan<*
by the way he connected with ' the
leather. Three times straight did he
shoot the .ball safely over UleMi^ads
of the infielders. Each hit was free
from flaw and a* clean cut as ever a
ballplayer tore off.
Tommy Leahy made an error," but it
was such a slight and measley one that
no one noticed it and besides the run
ner was out for turning the wrong way
at the first bag. Every native on the
tc am played ball . and the nine , sur-,
prised the knowing ones.
, Whalcji and Hughes ' twirled ' as
though ihey would ne\*er have another

court. . AH I ask is to.be let alone. If

Manager Morley was shown a dis
patch from San Francisco late to-night
In. which President Bert was quoted as
saying the Los Angeles Baseball Asso
ciation will be heavily finell. and said-
Ther* were jeers from the crowd
when O'Connf 11 told. Dillon to take his
place" on the bench. The umpire Ask
ed for order, and made the statement
that-he-was acting under orders, and
that putting the Los Angeles -captain
out of the game was no -action of hrs.
Contrary to the programme an
nounced by .the baseball officials O'CoÂ«
nell was not arrested to-night but was
told by Attorney H. M. Millsap for the
Los Angeles . Baseball Association tha t
if hs attempted to prevent Dillon tak
ing part- in to-morrow's game he will
be /arrested and probably imprisoned.
O'Connell is in telegraphic communica
tioh'with President Bert at San Fran
cisco to-night and will act upon hia
instructions. .
When play was called this afternoon
Dillon took h:s place at first base.
O'Connell walked over to the base and
read .:i. telegram he had received from
President Bert instructing him not to
allow Dillon to play. Dillon went quiet
ly to the bench and Spies succeeded
him at first.
LOS ANGELES. March 24. âThe
question as to whether Captain Frank
Dillon will play ball in Los Angeles or
gf> to Brooklyn, against his wishes,
will .be decided in the courts. Man

CAPTAINS OF THE PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE TEAMS WHICH PLAYED HERE YESTERDAY.
DENVER CHAMPION* IX HIS ROAD CLOTHES AND THE HOME BOY IX A FAMILIAR POSE.
Morris Levy and .James Coffroth of
the Hayes Valley and Yosemite clubs
promised the committee to arrange a
benefit for Frank McCdnnell, the young
pugilist who was injured in a boxing
contest.
Chairman Boxton said he had been
informed that the association itself
violated the rules the infringement of
which had resulted in the expulsion of
the clubs named. Sol Levison testified
that he had acted for the association
in the giving of an amateur exhibition
to raise money to send some boxers to
the St. Louis Exposition and that the
contestants had been paid all the way
from $15 to $60 .each. The permit for
the exhibition was granted by the Su
pervisors to the association.
Supervisor MeCIellan referred to the
fact that the association had exonerat
ed Sam Berger, but put other amateur
boxers under the ban although ail
had received money for appearing In
amateur_contests. Lynch said the as
sociation had not succeeded in estab
lishing that Berger had received money.
A. . Kaplan of the newly organized
California Amateur Association stated
his organization had formulated rules
for amateur contests and that $0 per
cent of the boxers had boycotted the
association because it would not give
contestants any more compensation
than its rules provided.
T. I. Fitzpatrick admitted, for argu
ment sake, that money had bee'n paid
contestants on all sides in violation
of the rules, but claimed that the lino
should be drawn some time or there
would be no difference between an ama
teur and a professional. He said tho
Olympic Club could not give any good
exhibitions because the amateur, box
ers refused to box for trophies, saying
they could get $73 from the other clubs.
â¢Eggers contended this condition existed
under the regime of the Pacific Asso
ciation. V
E. J. Lynch of the association ex
plained that the clubs had been ex
pelled from the organization because
they had held contests outside of their
own OTmnasiums and had paid the
amateur boxers money for appearing.
The Supervisors' ' Police Committee
filed a majority report yesterday that
the petition of the Pacific Athletic As
sociation that no permits for amateur
boxing contests be -granted the Bay
City, Lincoln and "San Francisco clubs
be overruled. Supervisors Eggers and
MeCIellan voted in favor of the recom
mendation and Boxton voted against it.
Boxton claimed that it'had been shown
that the amateur rules had been vio
lated by the clubs, which -resulted in
their suspension from the association.
Under the terms of the ordinance an
amateur club- must -'be a member of
the association 10 be granted a permit.
Kgrgers said he had heard this provision
was declared illegal by Judge Seaweil.
The majority of the committee there
upon reported In favor of granting the
Bay City Club a permit for April 6.

The fhip that never returned did not
carry nearly as extensive and as valu
able cargo as did Ahumada, favorite
for the chapter 4 yesterday at Oakland
track.
'Doc' Kyle thought his mudlark a
certainty, notwithstanding that Jockey-
Club was numbered among the fleet.
From 8 to 5 the price fell by degrees
to 9 to 10. and when C. Smith ordered
the lines cast loose and Ahumada left
the Futurity course mooring he Vas
loaded down to the plimsol mark with
smart money.
Pleasant weather was encountered
the first quarter, then a squall .blew
up and Jockey Club was sightea on
the starboard side. Jack Martin proved
the more skillful pilot, and with the
first choice under forced draught
Jockey Club forged ahead, docking a
length in advance of the Kyle sprinter.
The overdue Misty's Pride came In
four lengths later. It was a severe
blow to the big speculators.
Favorites split the card with longer
priced horses in the betting. The
track was in a heavy condition and
some days will elapse before it will
again be fast.- There was an excellent
crowd present and no dearth of money
in the rinÂ«?..
YOUNG PEPPER FAILS.
Young Pepper is certainly a grand
piece of equine bric-a-brac, fit to grace
the shafts of any potato peddler's
wagon. It looked as if Frank
O'Rourke's colt ought to run backward
and beat the bunch in the opening race
and when the bookmakers chalked up
even money everybody felt sorry for
them. The Pepper horse led to the
stretch and then stopped as if hit in
the head with a bung starter. North
West, with Knapp up, now took the
lead, only to be later % on beaten out a
head by the 20 to 1 shot Elmer L with
McHannon up. Vigoroso finished third.
There appeared to be some doubt ex
isting as to whether or not Meada was
up on edge and in the betting on the
two-year-old dash the black filly's price
went from 6 to 5 to 9 to 5. Just before
post time the money went in and 6 to 5
was again the prevailing quotation.
Ridden by Jack Martin, she led from
the jump, winning easily from Esco
bosa and Eduardo. Light of Day,
which looked the contender, was cut
off and put out of commission by Bon
ner on Escobosa before reaching the
stretch.
Jockey Mountain finally graduated
from the maiden class here in the six
and a half furlong selling run follow
ing. He had the mount on Criss Cross,
an 11 to 20 choice, and the mare won
all the way. Martin finished second on
Maraschino, a neck in advance T>t Miss
May Bowdiih. Harka was prominent
for a time, fading away later with the
Judges' stand In sight. ':\ ~
GALANTHUS A WINNER.
Jimmy Coffey's gelding Galanthus, a
13 to 10 choice, ridden by Buxton, car
ried off the mile and fifty-yard purse.
Flaneur looked the dangerous one and
for a time It seemed he might win. The
McCafferty, horse is none too game
when collared, and the favorite led him
out more than a length at the finish.
Boutonnier<\ at odds of 13 to 1, ran into
the show. Both Pat Morrissey and Si
lurian ran disappointing races.
Ocyrohe, another one from the Coffey.
stable, went to the post a 6 to 5 favor
ite for the concluding race of the day,
with Buxton in the saddle. The colt
ran his race, but was outfooted from
start to finish by Walter Jennings' Le
tola, piloted by Travers. The winner
ruled second choice In the ring. The
show fell to Hulford.

TIIEEE FAV01UTES LAND
â¢ Â» *
There is more or le^s pathos in the
biography of every female vagrant ar
raigned* in the Police Court, but it Is
doubtful whether a more piteous story
was ever unfolded than young and
pretty Winnie Toya yesterday told to.
Judge Mogan. The girl's recital was
accompanied by choking sobs as she
expressed her desire to lead a beutr
life than the one she was arrested~for
following.
She came from a rural home in El
Dorado County, she said, with inten
tion of earning a livelihood for herself
and her widowed father, a helpless
octogenarian. For a time she worked
aa a domestic and struggled bravely to
resist the temptations that beset at
tractive and impecunious girlhood in
this big city, but she found that her
scanty earnings did not suffice to pro
vide her father with the comforts she
felt he was entitled to. ' Then she
learned that more money could be made
without necessary sacrifice of virtue by
serving a& a "waitress" In the ques
tionable resorts on the Barbary Coast,
and in a misguided moment she applied
for and obtained employment in a
dance hall managed by one Natalia
Toya. Disillusion came quickly to the
girl. The details of her downfall, partly
corroborated by Police Officer Joy.'vis
ibly affected the Judge.
â¢ "This case against you is dismissed."
he said to the weeping girl, "because
I am satisfied you did not willingly
embrace the . degraded vocation in
which the officer found, you and that
you are eager to abandon It. Take
your father back to the country and
stay there."
James Rogers, accused of battery,
stated he had four, fractured ribs and
displayed a broken finger when Judge
Mogan asked him what he had to v say
for himself. He was unable to explain
how he received the injuries, nor could
Special Officer Duane, who arrested him
aboard the ferry-boat Berkeley, cast
any light on the subject.
The testimony showed that Rogers
was intoxicated and asleep in the ferry
waiting-room when an official discov
ered him and requested that he ra
move himself. Rogers was hatlees, his
headgear could not be found, and ho
was in, ugly mood when he wandered
aboard the Berkeley, dropped into the
restaurant and ordered food. The wait
ers refused to serve him because hz
was drunk and disagreeable, and he in
turn refused to 'leave the place. An
effort to eject him resulted in a scuffle
and the arrest of Rogers.
"I'm all smashed up," said the de
fendant, when the complaint had been
recited, "and I'd like to know who
smashed me." ' Â¦*
"Were you smashed before you went
aboard the boat?" inquired the Judge-.
"Yes, I guess I was, for I remember
that my ribs were sore when I entered
the restaurant." .
"Was it to procure spare ribs that
you entered the restaurant?" asked the
court, and even the prisoner saw the
joke and laughed at it. .â¢'
Then the case was continued till

ascertain, if possible, just how, when
and where his bodily Injuries were re
ceived.

"It has been- the custom of this court
to Impose a fine "of $30 or $40 for selling
lottery j tickets," remarked Judge Mo-
Ran to Henry Jones, -who had pleaded
guilty of thus offending at 126 Kearny
street, "but in this case I may increase
the penalty. I'll have my mind made
up about this time to-morrow, Mr.
Jones."
Judge Fritz's latest quotation for sell-
Ing lottery tickets is $100, and it re
mains to be seen whether his Honor
Judga Mogan will equal It.
Leslie Falkenberg, who falsely ac
cused Mamie Garrtty of abandoning
her infant child and incidentally swore
to other falsehoods, was given twenty
four hours' imprisonment for contempt
of Judge Mogan's court, and will be
tried before a jury next Monday on the
charge of unlawfully procuring Mamie
Garrity's arrest. A charge of perjury is
also being worked up against Falken
berg. His mother appeared in 'court
yesterday and stated that when he
swore he had a brother Albert he lied
and that in her opinion he is mentally
deranged.

Thomas Whaling was living up to his
surname when a policeman found him
cruelly beating a horse, and for the of
fense Judge Mogan gave him permis
sion to choose between paying a $10
fine or serving ten days in prison.
Thomas preferred the former penalty.
Meyer Jacobs had $10 65 in one of his
pockets when Officer J. D-Bradenhauf.r
arrested him for begging in the West
ern Addition. He will be sentenced to
morrow. The policeman testified that
Meyer's method of mendicancy was
suggestive of intent to steal, as he en
tered and explored basements of dwell
ings before he appeared at the back
doors and frightened timid housewives.
Finding that he had lost his latch
key, Sergio Solano broke a window of
his residence, on Dupont street, near
Broadway, early yesterday morning,
and was starting to crawl through the
aperture when Policeman Daniels ar
rested him for disturbing the peace that
environs that vicinity during the small
hours. Judge Mogan is considering the
complaint, and this morning he may
have decided whether it is proper for a
man who has lost his latch key to dis
turb the peace or preserve it by quietly
staying out all night:
Michael Coyne and Cornelius Murphy,
both gray-haired, were boys together
and had been separated for years when
they met as codefendants yesterday in
Judge Mogan's court. The ' charge
against them was depositing garbage
upon a waste place south of Market
street, but they were so deeply ab
sorbed in exchange of greeting and
reminiscence that they had been fined
$5 apiece before they realized that their
case- was disposed of. Then they smil
ingly . paid their fines and went forth
arm-in-arm to celebrate their reunion.
Williaif J. Gadbury, employed in the
electricaf department of the United
Railroads, was riding on a Fillmore
street car when the machinery of the
vehicle became deranged and necessi
tated the transfer of the passengers.
When the conductor, J. W. Bolton, re
quested Mr. Gadbury to betake himself
to another car that gentleman protest
ed, and casually cast unfavorable re
flections on the competency of the crew
that" put the passengers to such incon
venience. The conductor, retorted in
kind, and then his critic struck him
upon the face and. was immediately ar
rested. ; / v . i -'.
"My client^was simply exercising hla
right of free speech when the conductor
insulted him," said the attorney for the
defense. * - i /
"Your client simply neglected to at
tend to his own business and leave that
of the conductor, to the attention of the
conductor," declared Judge Cabaniss.
"If people would refrain from butting
in where their advice or comment is
not solicited there would be much less
work for you attorneys and us Judges.
I fine your client $10 for assault."
Henry Talman, a 17-year-old lad who
resides with his parents at 804' Minna
street and is an apprentice in an iron
works, was the defendant before Judge
Cabaniss on a complaint sworn to by
Miss Annie Sheridan of 1433 Fols6m
street, who testified that while she was
walking along Market street he snatch
ed her nurse, from her hand and was
retreating with it, when It slipped from
his lingers and dropped at her feet.
Then, she added, he returned, placed
his hand upon her shoulder and solici
tously inquired as to the state of her
health, whereupon she summoned a
convenient policeman and had him ar
rested. . - " ,
To this serious charge the boy plead
ed not guilty. He denied the purse
snatching accusation in toto and . ac
knowledged that he had accosted the
complainant as ; she had testified, but
did to because he had mistaken her
for a young lady with whom he is well
acquainted. .
Judge Cabaniss took the case under
advisement until to-day. '
When death deprived E. J. Siangan's
six young children of their mother's
care the man became despondent and
foolishly sought solace in drink. From
a sober and. industrious citizen he was
gradually sinking to the level of a con
firmed sot, when Secretary White of
the S. P, C. C. had him arrested and
taken before Judge Mogan to see if
he could not be. persuaded to devote
more attention to the proper rearing
of his offspring. Mr. White did not
want to have the man imprisoned, but
-simply warned that he would be pun
ished if he continued to Ignore his pa
ternal responsibilities. So the Judge'
continued the' case until April 7, and
informed the defendant that if he does;
not treat his children properly during,
the interim he will certainly be jailed.
Mangan Is a butcher. Â¦
Katsouni Kobaiyashi, a little brown
man who ran amuck in St. Mary's
place the other evening and stabbed
several of his compatriots, is held in
$2000 to answer before the Superior
Court. He was arrested by Policemen
McShane, Mills and Lycette, and they
unite in the opinion that if the Mika
do's army were made up of such hu
man toughness as K. K. proved him
self possessed of the odds against the
Slavs would be tremendous. This opin
ion is shared by Judge Cabaniss.
For distributing obscene literature in
the shape of advertising circulars Dr.
J. N. Brown, a medical specialist, was
fined $50 .by Judge Cabaniss, who sup
plemented the sentence with a gratui
tous warning.
Louis Novinski and Moses Levy,
against" whom three distinct charges
of burglary In the- 'Western Addition
were clinched by Detectives O'Day and
Mulcahey, are held to the Superior
Court, with bail fixed at $2000 apiece
on each charge. The detectives in
formed Judge Mogan that they have
twenty-one other clear cases of bur
glary against the youthful defendants.
For kicking a dog belonging to Wil
liam Norton and threatening to shoot
the animal's owner when he entered
protest Edward Samuelson was fined
$100 by Judge Conlan.
Judge Mogan is confronted by a
nice problem in the case of Ah Pang,
Ah Loo and Ah Wong, accused of in
fringing bill 944, ordinance 937, which
provides that it shall be unlawful for
any person to visit or resort to any
place or room so barred or barricaded
as to b* difficult of access or ingress
to the police. The three defendants
named were found to be the sole in
mates of a room so barred or barri
caded in Chinatown, and now their
attorney cites another section of the
ordinance which_ says "It is" unlawful
to visit such room or place when
three or more persons are present,"
and asks for dismissal of his clients
on the ground that as there were no
other persons in the room when they
were arrested they cannot legally be
held for visiting the room when "three
or more persons were there. The court
has the question under advisement,
and his interpretation of the ordin
ance is likely to be that the intent of
the Legislature was tcr prevent the
assembling of three or more persons
behind a barred door for gaming or
other illegal purpose.
Arthur Cullen, an eighteen-year-old
lad who ate hot cakes and coffee in a
Howard-street restaurant and then ran
away without paying for the viands,
was arrested and released on his own
recognizance to appear for trial yes
terday in Mogan's court. He failed to
fulfill his pledge, however, and a bench
warrant was issued for his arrest-
Now he is in the City Prison and will
remain there until the complaint
against him is disposed of.
John Hamilton, who shot holes
through a glass door panel in the resi
dence of his brother-in-law, in the
Richmond District, is willing to plead
guilty of simple assault, but Judge
Mogan has not yet decided to accept
that plea. Hamilton's wife had de
serted him and sought refuge in the
dwelling of her brother when the
shooting occurred, about a month ago.
Herschel Goodman will be tried be
fore Judge Mogan on the charge of
stealing a, purse from a German re
mittance man yesterday morning in
a -saloon at Mason and Ellis streets.
The purse was empty when Officers
Hayden and Matheson found it upon
the floor of the patrol wagon in which
they conveyed Goodman to the City
Prison. . \
Judge Conlan gave William Ramello
and August Peroria six months each
for petty larceny and fined Dr. S.
Holkstra $100 for practicing medicine
without a license.

reported, but will be placed In charge of the-
Newport, in place of Captain .T. W. Saunters.
Captain Saunders has been selected to com
mand the Manchuria, the second of the Pa
cific Mall Company's new big liners. The ap
pointment of Captain Saunders to ' this im
portant command comes as the reward ; of
years of faithful and efficient service. | During
the Spanish War. when the Newport . was
chartered by . the Government as an army
transport. Captain Saunders won golden opin
ions for the tactful . manner In which he
handled his army passengers. For some months
the Newport was used as headquarters and a
sort of flagship by General Otis, who holds
thÂ« ship and her skipper In high esteem. Chief
Engineer Brolly and J. R. Clarkson. v/ho left

The pantsmakers and their employes
are said to have come to terms on a
$2 25 a day schedule. It Is said that six
firms have already agreed to these
terms, and should the others follow the
trouble will be ended.
The stablemen are said to be at outs
with their employers again, and It la
rumored that the men will ask for an
other increase of $2 50 a week in wages.
It Is probable that the difficulty be
tween the two factions, of the Painters*
Union will soon be settled. Josrph
Skemp, a prominent worker from the
East, has arrived In the city, and It Is
thought he will settle the trouble.
Although the engineers* difficulty
with the steam schooner owners has
been compromised. It is probable that
the vessels will remain Idle for some
time to come. As soon as it looked
promising for a favorable response to
the engineers* demand for overtime pay
Harbor 15 of the Masters' and Pilots*
Association put in a similar demand
for the deck officers. .This was settled
satisfactorily and the steam schooners
might now be in commission, but the
cooks and sailors have demanded con
cessions, and until this latest grievance
has" been settled captains, mates nor
engineers will have opportunity to
profit by the terms of their new agree
ments.

Schmitz expressed himself in favor
of the improvement and informed the
committee that the matter would be
referred to the Bureau of Engineer

was not too great the Board of "Work3
would at once take the necessary steps
to improve the street, Schmitz said.
Schmitz also said that owners In

the board to put down new sidewalks,
as they are required to do under the

Shortly before she pulled out an en
terprising young man made a bold ef
fort to stow away. Freighted with two
canvas-covered telescope grips, he
walked up the gangplank with as much
much assurance as did Dowie, the un
accepted Messiah, who traveled on the
Sonoma the previous voyage. The man
with the telescope grips had watched
his chance to pass the quartermaster
stationed at the shore end of the gang
way and succeeded in reaching the
deck without being asked for his ticket.
He laid his grips on the deck, mingled
with the crowd of passengers and dis
appeared. Something in the furtive
glide up the gangplank attracted the
attention of Captain Howard, who sug
gested to Purser Hodson that he find
out something, of the man-in-a-hurry.
After a search the owner of the grips
was located In a snug corner of the
upper deck counting the strands in one
of the boat lashings. He had no ticket
and was unprovided with funds. He ac
cepted tjje situation gracefully and
walked ashore with as much assurance
as he had gone on board. He caught a
glimpse of Captain Howard's smile,
however, as he stepped off the plank
and did not linger on the wharf.

When the committee had been ap
pointed Bennett stated that the irrlsra
tionlsts meet the first Tuesday of
each month in Modesto and Turlock.
As the towns are fifteen miles apart
Bennett suggested that the commute?
visit Modesto in- the morning and Tur
lock in the aftarnoon.
"Yes." replied Bennett. "But you
understand that we have the first
rights as lrrisationists. This is a val
uable right and if it was vested In
private ownership San Francisco would
have to pay very dearly for the priv
ilege."
"What do the irrigationists contrib
ute?" asked D'Ancona.
"We will waive our claims and will
help you get the bill granting water
rights to San Francisco through Con
gress. This city can never get thÂ»
right to us? the reservoir sites on the
Tuolumne River If we oppose them,"
answered Bennett.
"If you go to Modesto," said Bennett,
"with your minds made up to give 600
second feet of water in perpetuity l>>
the irrigation districts in addition to
what they are now diverting I am
safe in saying that you will encounter
no difficulty In arriving at a satisfac
tory arrangement and the bill will not
be opposed in Congres3. At the present
time we take only the natural How of
the river, to which we have undisputed
rights."
In reply to Supervisor d'Ancona.
Bennett said that if this city abandoned
the project the Irrigationists would
build dams to get the additional water
they required.
"Then." said D'Ancona. "the proposi
tion Is that this city must bear the ex
pense of $500,000 in order to give y<Â»u
this additional water, the price bein^r
the removal of your objections?"
Dockweller stated that the amount "f
water asked for by the irrigationists is
33 1-3 per cent of what the city is now
using and is in addition to what they
are diverting at present, amounting lu
200 cubic second feet. Dockweiler ad
vised care in the negotiations because
if the demands of the Irrigationists are
conceded there would be difficulty in
supplying the water especially In Sep
tember, when but one-third of the res
ervoir capacity is stored.
Commissioner Casey said he had been
over the ground and said if dams are
raised there would be untold quantities
of water for all concerned.
John E. Bennett, representing th*
Modesto Irrigation District, stated that
his clients required 600 cubic second
feet only during two months in the
year.
The Supervisors' Public Utilities
Committee yesterday decided on the
appointment of a special enmmitte* lu
csnf-r with the representatives of tbj
Turlock and Modesto irrigation dis
tricts in order if possible to arrive at
seme amicable agreement whereby the
districts named will withdraw their
opposition to the proposed bills no*
btfore Congress granting this city cer
tain water rights at the headwaters uf
the Tuolumne River as the nucleus of
a municipal water system. The com
mittee consists of Commissioner Wood
ward of thÂ»_> Board of Public Works.
City Attorney Long. Supervisor Braun
hart. J. H. Dockweiler and Assistant
City Engineer J. R. Price.
Price stated that the proposition dis
cussed recently was to gU** the irriga
tionlsts 600 "cubic second feet" of
water, but he did not think it advisable
to enter Into an agreement to deliver
this amount of water under existing
conditions. The water would irrigate
200,000 acres of land. Price said that
additional water could be obtained by
raising the Hetch Hetchy dam at an
expense of S500.C09.
The report of the City Engineer that
it will cost $5100 to Improve Nineteenth
avenue from Trocadero road to Ocean
avenue was referred to the Finance
Committee to be considered when the
next budget is taken up.
UiUogley btated that Gray Bros, were
grading on Thirtieth street without a
permit. Grav said his Mini was grad
ing - its own property and in front
of it, but that work had been stopped
upon order of a street inspector.
The petition of the .Laborers' Protec
tive Union that provision be made for
the cleaning of streets by' the city and
that all employes engaged in such work
be paid the minimum wages of $2 50 per
day was referred to the Board of
Works fcrr investigation and report.
The petition of- the Santa Fe Rail
way system' for an extension of sixty
days from April 30 within which to
complete a bridge over Nineteenth
street was reported favorably upon.
The petition of the Excel6ior Home
stead Association to repaVe the road
way of Mission street to the county
Hne was referred to the Board of Works
for examination and report.
E. W. McKlnstry and Mrs. Emma L.
Merritt, executors of the Sutro estate,
opposed the proposed change of grades
on I and J streets west of Fifth avenue
on the ground that it would damage
the property of the estate in the vicin
ity. The committee deferred action to
give the parties interested a chance
to compromise the matter. The protest
ants hold that the change should be
an 8 per cent grade instead of 9 per
cent, as ordered by the Board of Works.
Thr ordinance regulating the busi
ness of rock crushing by requiring a
permit' to be first obtained from the
Board of Supervisors was laid over for
one week.
George Gray asked that considera
tion of the bills be postponed until the
board could ascertain if Gray Bros,
would live up to their agreement to
conduct operations so they would not
be a nuisance.
The Supervisors* Street Committee
yesterday referred to the board the two
ordinances extending the limits wltfiln
which it is prohibited to carry on rock
quarrying or rock crushing with the
recommendation that the bills pass.
The ordinances are identical with the
two vetoed by the Mayor, the vetoes
having been sustained by the board.
R. \V. Gillirgley. representing the resi
dents in the vicinity of Thirtieth and
Castro streets who arc opposed to the
establishment of a rock quarry by
Gray Bros., urged the committee to re
port in favor of the paBsage of the
ordinances.
"I therefore do not desire to approve
of an ordinance which I regard as il
legal under the strict terms of the char
ter and the decision of the court re
garding encroachments on the side
walks. I see no particular reason why
I should veto the ordinance because I
consider it illegal. I do not care to
again call on friendly Supervisors to
sustain my veto, so I think that the
wisest course is to withhold my signa
ture from the ordinance. Under the
charter the ordinance thus becomes a
'awâ that is, if what I regard as an il
legal ordinance can be called a law. It
will be a matter for court adjudication
at all events, and I do not desire to in
terfere in the matter, seeing that the
sentiment of the public appears to be
in. favor of the free flower markets. I
believe that the Board of Public Works
has entire jurisdiction over the prohibi
tion of sidewalk privileges, and the
matter should be left to that body."
Under the charter the Mayor is al
lowed (en days to approve or disap
prove of any resolution or ordinance.
Should he fail to sign a bill within the
prescribed time it becomes a law with
out his approval. The ten days will ex
pire to-day, and unless tfie Mayor
changes his mind in the meantime he
will return the ordinance to the Board
of Supervisors without his signature.
"It is my opinion," said the Maydr.
"that the ordinance granting privileges
to itinerant flower venders is clearly
illegal. I am of the firm opinion that
the courts will so hoKl in view of the
Superior Court's decision in the matter
of bootblack stands being maintained
on the sidewalks. >, ;~*
Mayor Schmitz declared yesterday
that he will decline, to affix his signa
ture to the ordinance providing for the
establishment of free public flower
markets at the corner of Market -and
Powell streets and other designated lo
cations in. the downtown districts'.
The Mayor expresses the opinion that
the Ordinance is illegal O n its face, be
cause the charter specifically forbids
the granting of any special privileges.
His Honor therefore believes that his
signature will not legalise the ordin

CHICAGO. March 24. â Even before the pre- |
dictions of the co!d wave the wheat pit was
generally' bullish on receipt of continued com
plaints from many sections regarding the un
promicing appearance of the growing crop.
Spurred on . by firm Liverpool cables, there
was an active general demand at the start.
Initial quotation* on July were lower to V t c
higher, at 83HÂ®8Uc. Influenced by the poor
crop prospects ehorts covered quite freely early 1
in the session. As offerings were light, prices <
steadily advanced. While quotations were i
climbing upward the Weather Bureau pre
dicted a cold wave throughout the West and
Southwest. This announcement instilled
greater energy into the buying movement, i'on- I

became an iniuortaxit factor In speculative j
trading-. At S7%c for July there wan much !
profit-taking, and the market suffered some
reaction from the higher point. The demand,
however, continued good, and the close was
strong, with July aft 87c. May cloned at 04c,
after ranirlng between 02c and 04%c.
With the help of strength in wheat the corn
market resisted the efforts of th? bears to
break prices. The close was firm, with May
at 52&c and Julv at 4!)%ift40^,c.
OatÂ» were rather heavy, despite the advance

Â¦ Trading in the fruit market was .dull and
listless, particularly In the Orange depart

filled. A large portion of the receipts are
showing evidences of decay and offerings of
choice and fancy grades have to be carefully
repacked. The managers of the auction com
pany announced that rive cars would be offered
at to-day's sale. The other Citrus fruits were
unchanged and featureless.

BARLEYâ The air was full of resorts and
rumors of large foreign Inquiries again yes
terday. ,How many of them are. bona tide re
mains to be fcecn. There was a definite sale
of 1500 sacks to; arrive at:$l 15. and another
transaction, also said tolmvp ton actually
closed, wa* * sale .of 3000 J tons', for export* to
Japan. The latter was done during the fore
noon. Otter reports, not confirmed, however,
but wlilch excited a good deal of inquiry and
guessing, were that England was In the mar
ket for 12,000 tons and that Russia had sent
requests for quota tjopa. on /Â«0CO tons. Of
course such reports as these naturally tend to
harden the market and strengthen the views
of holders, so the situation is very firm again
in spite of the weakening influence of the
ralniÂ». and both casffvgraln and futures were
higher.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
There were liberal receipts of Butter late in
the forenoon, and in the afternoon there was
considerably more on the market than for some
little time past. : Prices showed no cha.nge one
way oi the other, dealers reported the
feeling rather easy than otherwise.
Cheese drags along without ~ chanee and
stock* are still excessive.
Receipts of Eggs suddenly ' dropped to 834
caÂ«eÂ», against 1877 the day before, which was
quite a shrinkage. The result was a firm and
slightly* higher market, though the advance is
believed to be temporary. Prices are now so
high' for this time of the year that the cold
storage speculators are beginning to feel the
necessity for caution and are going more
slowly, though they are still buying In the
country for this account. Sales of extra. choice
store Kggs were reported as high as 20c,
though : it takes a pretty good store Eju' to
bring thtg figure.
Receipts were 31,300 lbs Butter, 834 cases
Eggs and 15,900 lbs Cheese. *

stated yesterday, that arrangements
are being, completed to put the school
exhibit for the St. Louis Exposition on
display, in the drawing-rooms of the
Lincoln Grammar ..School on Fifth
street during three days of next week.
The exhibit has considerable
attention, but Langdon is desirous of
having aa manjr people view the dis
play as want to." T.o that end he has
selected a 'more central location for
the display.- He will ask for teachers
to volunteer to take charge of the ex
hibit and explain: the work of the ptj
pils, all of which, is highly meritori
ous and reflects 'Â¦ great credit on the
originators. :'.'â¢'Â¦'.<

WILL ERECT MONUMENT
TO LATE JOHANN STRAUSS
The araucaria, the only tree the mon
key cannot find nerve to climb, is also
one of the exhibits. John Vallance, the
Cox Seed Company's/, representative,
takes particular interest in a specimen
of white heather,' that would, indeed,
make any Scotchman beam with pride.
In the same collection are the brick
red azalea mollis, a native of the north
ern part of California and Oregon, and
the blue, pink and vermilion 7 cineraria.
There is a wonderfu/ variety j of the
sword fern, or Nephlrolepls piersonii,
the foliage of which is crested, longhand
pendulous. The Japanese cypress tree,
a dwarf In height, is not unlike a; va
riety exhibited by Domoto Bros.' a few
seasons ago, and is most interesting to
look upon. p|
John Rock has brought to the ; city
from the California Nursery Company
of Niles a rare collection ;< of . double
roses and a peach tree rich with beau
tiful deep pink blossoms.
RARE WHITE HEATHER.
Japan comes in prominent in . the
floricultural contest, many, of that
country's most beautiful flowers being
exhibited by ithe Cox Seed Company.
Among them are the pink, white-edged
azaleas, while the same, flower is shown
also in white of the purest kind.' Then
there is the Japanese maple, a little
'over two feet high. The leaf is blood
red in color and is laciniated. There is
also a pretty display of the Japanese
flowering; cherry, , .which is used in
Japan extensively for sidewalk orna
mentation. â¢â¢'.
Kettlewell has also in his keeping a
rich arrangement of poppies. Iris and
sweet-smelling wallflowers.
Almost side by side, with the wild
flora are seen in the sedate, cultivated
varieties from the luxurious gardens of
George A. Pope, and guarded by the
watchful William Kettlewell. llr.
Pope's exhibit 4 takes up the space of a
table twenty-four feet in length and
consists of annuals and perannuals.
There are narcissus, aquilegla, Shirley
poppies and. violets, stocks < and candy
tuft, sparaxis and kaffir lilies import
ed from the Cape of Good Hope, anem
onies and a table of pansies of the most
beautiful varieties. *
Mrs. Wiester's display consists, of
iris, yellow pansies, buttercups, pop
pies, frittllaria (brown bells), hyacinth
and other varieties of flowers growing
wild.
Rarely has there been seen a more
beautiful collection of hyacinths, daf
fodils, pansies and poppies and all the
other varieties of the early spring
flower family.
Mrs. W. S. Chandler, who has distin
guished herself In former years by ex
hibiting wild flowers plucked from the
neighboring hills, has once more a dis
play of similar but more extensive
character. First of all, Mrs. Chandler
has taken up the full width of the
south of the great nave, where she has
placed in natural fashion no less
than thirty kindsof Oregon moss," out
of which spring trilliums, fritillaria,
collinsia, goooseberry blossoms, currant
blossoms, yellow violets and the'wee,
delicate, pretty nemophila, generally
known as "baby eyes." Â¦Â¦ . â¢
â¢ Mrs. W. H. Wiester, too, has a beau
tiful display of the vagabond flowers
which inhabit "anywhere and every
where" over the San Br,uno hills, and
roundabout.
BEAUTIFUL WILD FLOWEUS.
The exhibition this year is eight
weeks earlier than on former occasions,
and-^when it is remembered that the
great variety of garden and wild flow
ers have been gathered in the midst of
hail, rain and wind storms of several
weeks' duration* the labor, it must be
acknowledged, has been attended ,wlth
remarkable success.
That the spring exhibition of the
California State Floral Society is a wel
come institution was emphasized yes
terday morning by the big crowd that
attended the formal opening of the an
nual floral feast at the Ferry building
nave.
The Leedham Bulb Company of
Santa Crjuz has sent a wondrous dis
play of narcissus ,and daffodils and
the school children of Decoto are repre

outdoor grown carnations, ranging
from the pure white "Los Angeles" to
the dark crimson "Roosevelt."

ever so many other specimens of flow

The Mary and Ida was a two-masted
schooner of 174.54 net tons register.
She was built here In 1883 and was
owned by the Pacific Marine Supply
Company of this city. . Besides a cap
tain and two mates she carried a crew
of five.
Klein is still unable to walk. He
stayed with friends at 721 Davis street
last night and: to-day, will be taken to
the- Marine Hospital. The Czarina en
countered fair weather on the trip and
made . the run in eleven days from
Pirate Cove.
Second Mate Andy Stokes, Cook Wil
liam Klein and two seamen to Pirate
Cove, where the schooner Czarina took
them aboard and brought them to this
city.
It was while on Unga Island, two
days after the wreck, that William
Klein had his feet frozen to such an
extent- that amputation of three toes
will be necessary. .Klein, while walking
in the hills, was unable to find his way
to the station and th* terrific cold
caused him to become dizzy and faint.
Upon awakening he found both of his
feet frozen so that he was unable to
walk. Fishermen found him and ap
plied the usual remedies at hand.
Clunie estate, and that decision win
stand.
i An empty water barrel was then
thrown overboard from the schooner
and the wind carried it to the beach.
By this time more of the fishermen had
lowered themselves over the bluff.
With the line floated ashore they pulled
a dory containing several of the crew
through the breakers a place or
safety. Several trips were necessary
to land all hands and the undertaking
was fraught with great danger.
The survivors were soon safely
housed in the station buildings.' After
remaining five days on the island the
schooner Edna Watts conveyed Cap
tain Ipsen, First Mate John Tiburn,
ALL. ARE SAVED.
Suddenly -one of the anchors gave
way and the vessel began drifting
toward Kellys Rock. For a few bnaf
momenta ,the other anchor retarded
the schdoner's drift to destruction, but
the wind triumphed and those on board
realized that nothing could save the
ship. Nearer . and. nearer the stanch
little craft drifted to the beach until
with a crash and a quiver she struck
one of the submerged bowlders which
abound on this bleak coast. She struck
amidships, and the rudder and wheel
box . were carried away by the Jar.
Water rushed in, and the Mary and
Ida sank forward in a few minutes.
Several of the crew made for the
forecastle to save some of their be
longings, but the inrushing water
drove them back. All believed that
the last hour had come, as there ap
peared to be no chance of effecting a
landing through the boiling surf.
At this juncture several shadowy
forms were seen on the bluff high
above. The -hardy fisherman from
Winchester station did not intend to
see eight lives sacrificed without mak
ing an effort to save them. To think
was to act with these volunteer life
savers. A line secured by a dory anchor
was dropped over, the cliff. Hand ever
hand \ an Intrepid fisherman lowered
himself down the 400-foot wall, the
wind swaying him pendulum-like
against the face of the bluff. He
reached the, beach in safety and a cheer
went up from the imperiled mariners.
A dramatic tale Â¦ of | the wrecking of
the American Codfish Company's
schooner. Mary and Ida during a ter
rific - hurricane at Winchester-, station,
Unga Island, February 23, came from
the north last evening by the schooner
Czarina, which brought home the cap
tain and 'crew of the ill-fated codfisher.
The' schooner and a cargo of 70,000
codfish are a total loss, and had if
not_ been for the timely assistance of
the' fishermen at Winchester station
every soul aboard the craft would have
perished. Luckily every one escaped
without injury except William Klein,
the cook, who had his feet frozen sev
eral days after the -catastrophe while
lost in the hills of Unga Island.
The Mary and Ida sailed from 'this
city for the northern fishing grounds
January 17 of this year. After a fair
passage she arrived at Squaw Island
February 6 and took aboard 50,000 cod
fish. ; From there she sailed to Win
chester station, where the balance of,
the ; cargo was taken aboard. The ves
sel was anchored attout half a mile
off shore when the gale came which
drove, her to destruction. For eight
days preceding the wreck a storm
raged, and an extra anchor was put
out by Captain Ipsen as a precaution
ary measure. About 6 o'clock on. the
evening of February 23 the storm in
creased in fury ! until the wind had
attained a velocity of 90 or 100 miles
an hour.

CURED BYCUTICURA
1 Wonderful Change in One Night
In a Month Face Was
Clean as Ever.
"I was troubled with eczema on the
face for five months during which time
I -was In the care of physicians. Mj
face was in such a condition that I
coald not go out. It was going from
bad to worse and I gare np all hope,
when a friend of mine highly recom-
mended Caticura Remedies. The first
night after I washed mj face with Cu-
ticara Soap and used Cuticura Ointment
and Caticnra Resolvent it changed won-
derfully, and continuing the treatment
it removed all scales and scabs. From
that day I was able to go oat, and in a
month ray face was as clean as ever."
THOMAS J. SOTH, 317 Stagg St.,
Brooklyn, N.Y.
The above letter was received in 1893
and he again writes ns Feb. 19, 1903,
"I have not been troubled with eczema
since."
The agonizing itching and burning of
the skin .as in eczema; the frightful
j scaling, as in psoriasis; the loss of hair
and crusting â¢ of scalp, as in scalled
. head ; the facial disfigurement, as in
pimples and ringworm ; the awful suf-
fering of Infants, and anxiety of worn-
out parents, as in milk crust, tetter and
salt - rheum â all demand [ a " remedy of
almost superhuman virtues to success-
fully cope with them. That Cuticura
Soap, Ointment and Resolvent are such
stands proven beyond all doubt. ' No
statement is made regarding them that
Is not justified by the strongest evi-
I dence. . , The purity, and : sweetness, the
power to afford immediate ' relief, the
I certainty . of speedy and permanent
' ; cure, the : absolute safety . and great
economy have made them the standard
skin cures of the civilized world.
