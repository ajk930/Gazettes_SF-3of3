VOLUME XCVIIâNO. 42.
FLINT WILL PROBABLY WIN FIGHT FOR TOGA
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 10.âGeorge Hatton, Senator George C. Perkins' political director, arrived here to-night on the 7:30 o'clock train and went quietly to apartments that had been engaged
for him. Late this evening he was called into a caucus ef Fisk's forces. For some time the situation was discussed and then the agreement was reached that to-morrow morning a majority of
Fisk's supporters, at least, wilj enter the Flint caucus and will probably carry others with them. At a late hour to-night Walter Parker, Flint's most active lieutenant, said that he had secured
more than enough names to the caucus call to insure Flint's election on the first ballot to-morrow, and that at noon Frank P. Flint would be declared the legally elected United States Senator to
succeed Thomas R. Bard, the incumbent.
Fisk's Votes Are to Be Cast for Southern Man To-Day
FLINT'S MEN
SEE VICTORY
: CLAIM NEW RECRUITS
â¦ â 
Candidate in Hiding While
Backers Are at Work.
r. Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 10.âThe Flint
tnen were elated when their candidate,
true to the assertion of the Reuf dele
gation, developed the strength of 47
votes on the first ballot. They were
busy as bees about the Golden Eagle
lobby and in their candidate's head
quarters, congratulating each other on
the result of the ballot and the victory
that appeared to them to be at hand.
"There was a scramble of politicians
who had been teetering in the fight to
get next to the man who seemed about
to step into Bard's place. The hands
of the Flint men were wrung until they
ached and the elevator boy shed honest
perspiration as he worked the rope in
. carrying Flint's permanent friends and
his newly developed admirers up and
down the shaft.
CANDIDATE DISAPPEARS.
Candidate Flint escaped the rush and
many a glad handshake intended for
him never landed. Not long after the
.Assembly had adjourned he disap
peared. Late in the afternoon it was
announced at his headquarters that he
wa6 indisposed and had retired to his
private apartments. Early in the night
It was given out that he had gone to
bed. Except for some of the Los An
geles boosters and the polite colored
man who Is ever on duty there, the
â > headquarters were deserted long before
midnight.
Whether Candidate Flint had gone to
bed or whether he was In consultation
\vith Ruef and his other supporters is
not known. He was, at any rate, not
et his headquarters during the night.
John Mott of Los Angeles, one of the
men who has stayed close to Flint dur
ing most of the time he has been here,
was the only person whp seemed au
thorized to make a statement for Flint,
and all he would venture was that the
"Senatorial aspirant had gone to bed.
AGAIN GO TO WORK.
With the first exultation over, the
practical Flint men settled down to
work again. Having been in the game
before, they knew that a man is not
elected when he is fourteen shy of the
right number. In fact, the fourteen
made therifall the more nervous. They
â¢ began to evince a desire to shut out
competition, to close the affair up while
the goal was in reach, and before any
rival could bring about a situation that
(would be dangerous.
Work was begun at once on every
anti-Flint man whose adhesion to the
candidate for whom he had cast his
vote was not strong. There were some
who had not voted for Flint who were
really for him, and some who were
ready to jump any way the victory
seems certain.
Flint workers of the practical sort
were untiring during the afternoon and
toward evening a movement to secure
a caucus of 60 and declare Flint its
nominee was begun. Senator Hahn
circulated a roll call and It began to
fill rapidly with the men who had voted
for Flint, but 60 names were not ob
tained. The most the Flint supporters
claimed as agreeing to go into caucus
was 62, an alleged gain of 5 for the
Los Angeles man through the prose
lyting and the accession of any who
had determined to go over to Flint or
the leader after the first ballot. The
Claim of the Flint people is that 47
were actually present at the caucus.
Friends of the other candidates claimed
that the total number of on the
call was only 47 and but 31 were ac
tually present at the caucus.
GATHER FOR CAUCUS.
. The gathering lasted but a few min
.utes and was adjourned on the state
ment that it was desired to learn the
results of the caucuses then being held
by the supporters of other candidates.
The caucus was first called for 8
o'clock, then for 8:30, then for 9. To
ward the latter hour there were not
more than twenty legislators In the
Assembly chamber and some of these
were suporters of candidates other
than Flint, who had remained up to
the hour of the caucus to finish work.
Senator Hahn railed the gathering to
order. Assemblyman Bliss acted as
chairman and Assemblyman Houser as
secretary. Senator Hahn announced
from the floor that the eighteen men
then in caucus wanted the larger one
to go over until 9 o'clock the next
morning. The assembled legislators
then adjourned to the hour named and
the hotel lobbies were soon full of Flint
voters again.
The Flint men claimed to-night that
six of the Fisk votes had come over to
their candidate. They would give no
names. Some claims were made by
men not authorized to speak for leg
islators who, upon being interviewed,
declared they did not intend to change
their votes. It is pretty certain that
these six will change to Flint to-mor
row: Welsh, Amerige, Held, Jarvis,
McQowan and Pfaeffle. McGowan will
change on the second ballot and all the
others on the first. The following also
will change to Flint, bo some of his

RUEF AND STONE AID.
At the caucus of the Ruef men this
morning it took but a short time to
give the word for Flint. When the dele
gation got down to the sidewalk Can
didate Flint was there and he was soon
surrounded by the bunch, each of whom
received a handshake from the man
they hoped to make Senator.
One of the secrets revealed since to
day's ballot is that General George
Stone has been working all the time
for Flint. The general Is happy over
the situation and it is said that in case
of Flint's victory he will ba, one of the
first men to be rewarded.
"Stand Pat" is the slogan of George
A. Knight. He says that he can see
no signs of victory for Flint and that
he Is going to remain in till the decid
ing ballot is cast. Knight said further
that he had gathered his forces to
gether and that he had absolute assur
ances that there were no deflections
from his camp, though Flint's lieuten
ants show the signatures on their cau
cus papers of a few of Knight's men.
Judge Dibble, who is managing Knight's
fight, said he had seen harder battles
won, and they have got to show him
more than they have before he will
hoist the white flag and capitulate.
SPECULATION ON FISK.
"Stand pat" Is also the watchword of
Arthur G. Fisk's forces. Fisk was
busy rounding up his forces to-night
and addressing them on the situation
at two separate meetings. He was in
formed that Flint's men claimed they
had taken from him some of the pillars
of support, but he would have none of
it. He claimed positively that his forces
would standby him until he was elect
ed or released them from their obliga
tion. Fisk's forces will meet again at
8 o'clock in the morning.
"You know I can elect Flint at a
word." he said. "But while this is true
I am not going to do it. We are going
to stand pat."
Withal the situation here to-night is
most interesting. Flint's confidence
does not outshine the confidence of the
supporters of Bard, Knight and Fisk
in their contention that he has a hard
er road yet to travel than he imagines. I
Oxnard's letter arrived at a time and
was worded in a manner that caused
much speculation as to just what his
next move would be, every man here
being aware of his skill as a manipu
lator âskill that proved successful in
Washington in the game of politics
played with men of much greater ex
perience than those that compose the
California Legislature.
Fisk's position is attracting the most
attention, however. While it is admit
ted that a majority of his followers are
standing by him through motives of
personal friendship, it does not follow
that they will move into any other
camp at his bidding. Though Fisk re
marked that he could elect Flint at any
minute he desired, If such desire should
seize him, there are-some that disagree
with him, saying that his following will

THE San Francisco CALL
GEORGE A. KNIGHT GETS "BRICK"
ABE RUEF ACTS AS THE MESSENGER OF THE RAILROAD
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 10.âSigns at a
late hour to-night are indications of
Frank P. Flint's flection to the office
of United States Senator to-morrow
and yet several of the expert poli
ticians predict that the Los Angeles
candidate may fail in his efforts to
reach the winning post. It was fore
shadowed in The Call this morning
that the Ruef bunch of the San Fran
cisco delegation would go to Flint. The
prediction was verified and Flint's de
velopment of forty-seven votes did not
come as a surprise to the students of
the situation. There was a falling off
in the estimated strength of the Bard
column, yet the Junior Senator ranked
next to the leader in the balloting.
The "sentiment in favor of a southern
man will count much in Flint's favor
in future balloting.
There would be no surprise if Sen
ator C. B. Green well oft Santa Bar
bara who voted to-day for Senator
Bard should join the Flint fbrces to
morrow. It is also almost certain
that Senator Richard J. Welch of San
Francisco, who voted to-day for John
D. Daly, will cast his vote to-morrow
for Flint. Bard, Knight and Fisk are
endeavoring to hold their respective

columns unbroken. The Flint men,
encouraged by initial advantages, are
making the most vigorous efforts to
achieve further success. The Repub
lican caucus called by the Flint man
agers to-night was not decisive, but the
caucusing will be renewed at 9 o'clock
to-morrow. There are many indications
that a sufficient number of votes will
be eliminated from Bard, Knight and
Fisk to settle the contest in Flint's
favor.
A peculiar phase of the situation to
night is the "appeal of the Bard, Fisk
and Knight forces to Henry T. Oxnard.
While Oxnard was not voted for in the
balloting to-day, the fact is recognised
that he controls votes, and it is broad
ly hinted that he controls a sufficient
number to, prevent the election of Flint.
It is positively known that he can pre
vent several Assemblymen from going
into any caucus. A soutMern leader
made the remark to-night: "Oxnard
holds the key to the situation."
It transpires that Flint was Oxnard's
manager in the south until a few days
before he (Flint) entered the contest
at the suggestion of Walter Parker,
Henry T. Oage and J. W. McKinley.
There is not the best of feeling between
Oxnard and Flint. Walter Parker, the
leader and chief manager of the Flint
forces, is to-night directing his energies
to an attempt to break into the Fisk
camp. It is the judgment of onlookers
that Fisk, backed by Charles H. Spear,
president of the Harbor Commission
ers, cannot hold out against the as
saults of Ruef. Walter Parker and
John C. Lynch.
. George A. Knight received his gold
brick from with a greater de
gree of composure than was antici
pated. Politicians who are on the in
side say that the employment of Ruef
to deliver the souvenir was an act of
cruelty to Knight.
The orator's gilded package will be
carefully wrapped â in the letter which
he received from Senator Perkins and
on the outer fold the words "hands off"
will be printed. Knight is still anxious
ly awaiting a reply to the message
which he wired yesterday to his friend.
Senator George C. Perkins.
The report is deemed authentic that
Senator Lukens of Alameda will attend
the big caucus in the Assembly cham
ber at 9 to-morrow forenoon. He was
in San Francisco to-day saying good
by to his father and mother, who sailed
for a trip around the world. When
the first ballot for Senator took place

Gerberding States That He Has Assur
ances of an Increased Following.
Governor Pardee is accredited with
the impartiality of bestowing the fa
vors of the Alameda delegation on Sen
atorship like the dews of heavenâalike
on the just and unjust.
Walter Parker, the chief manager for
the Flint column, said at midnight: "I
have a sufficient number of signatures
to the caucus call to insure the elec
tion of Flint. I am over the fence and
have some votes to spare. Flint will be
chosen on the first ballot to-morrow.
OXNARD HOLDS ALOOF.
Sends Letter Explaining His Attitude
on the Fight.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 10.âThis
morning Henry T. Oxnard decided
that his name should not go before
the Legislature until after the first
or second ballot. Accordingly he pre
pared a letter, a copy of which he de
livered bo\h to the Flint and Bard
managers. The text o*. Oxnard's let
ter follows:
"Sacramento, Cal., Jan. 10.
"Hon. Frank P. Flint Hon. Chester
A. Rowell, Hon. D. T. Perkins, F. J.
Brandon, Otto GerberdingâDear sirs:
I have many friends among the mem
bers of the Legislature who have ex
pressed an intention of voting for me,
but, being interested in securing the
Senatorship for Southern California
and in pursuance of the policy under
which I have been acting for some
time, my name will not be formally
presented to the Legislature to-day,
nor my friends be asked to vote for
me until after a ballot or two has been
taken.
"I have arrived at this conclusion
through fear that a multiplicity of
candidates from Southern California,
in the preliminary balloting, might
endanger its interests.
"However, should neither of the
leading candidates secure the support
necessary to elect I shall expect my
friends in the Legislature to be given
an opportunity to exercise their pref
erence for me. Yours very truly,
"HENRY T. OXNARD."

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 10.âAll the
camps caucused to-night and more cau
cusing will take place to-morrow. At
the Bard camp, 19 of the 22 attended
the roundup. Assemblyman Perkins
and Frank Brandon assert that the
Bard forces will not break. Stories to
the effect that Amerige of Orange has
gone over to Flint are denied. It was
declared at the Bard headquarters that
Amerige would stand as firm and as
long as Anderson, and the latter is
rated as a Bard stalwart who will
fall, if he falls at all. on the firing line.
The story that Senator Oreenwell is
wavering is also discredited.
Otto Gerberding, Bard's chief man
ager upon the outside, was called to
Livermore to-day on account of the
illness of his sister. He wired to-night
advising the Bard men to stand firm,
as he had received assurances of ac
cessions to the Bard column. Thomas
Hughes, R. N. Bulla, C. T. Elliott.
James A. Louttitt, C. A. Young and
others of the Bard management Insist
that the fight Is still open and that all
Flint's abilities Will be required to hold
the strength that he developed to-day.
"It is not true," said one Bard man,
"that 52 or even 47 legislators attended
the Flint caucus. The actual attend
ance was 30, and the number of names
signed to the caucus tallied exactly
with his vote for Senator to-day", 47,
and no more."
The Fisk men held a prolonged con
ference to-night. Fisk said: "Only six
men were absent from Ihe caucus, and
I have seen them since the conference.
I am assured that there will be no
break to-morrow. The Senatorial
contest is not settled."
Senator Woodward of Sonoma laughs
at the rumor that he is going over to
the Flint camp upon the assurance that
he will be appointed superintendent of
the San Francisco Mint as soon as
Senator Flint has arrived in Washing
ton.
Henry T. Oxnard appeared for a few
minutes tc*-night in the lobby of the
Golden Eagle looking as debonair as
usual, but he did not mix with the
politicians gathered there. .
The Knight men caucused to-ntght.
Knight flatly contradicted the report
that Senator Rush of Solano is going
over to join the forces of the Los
Angeles candidate.
Ruef received a message to-night
concerning the condition of his father
which was so encouraging that he de
cided to remain here another day.

Rowell Opens the Battle by
Nominating Senator Bard.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 10.âWhatever
may be the outcome of the Senatorial
situation the fact remains that with
the great audience that gathered in
the Senate to-day George A. Knight
was the popular candidate. At the
mention of every other name the
plause was restricted, but when Sen
ator Selvage concluded his eloquent
appeal for support for George A.
Knight the audience threw aside its
conservatism and the Senate chamber
t resounded with the sound of clapping
hands and stamping feet.
But as to oratory Senator Charles
M. Shortridge led his colleagues. He
seconded the nomination of Arthur G.
Fisk and he threw his whole soul into
the task. He said he knew no north,
no south; that the destiny of the Re
publican party was all that awakened
.. his patriotism, but if geography was
to be the question then his argument
would be given weight, for in the elec
tion of Fisk neither north nor south
would be offended; the great center
of the State would receive what was
due it apd its great population and
wealth would be honorably and loyally
representedv
Many prominent people gathered in
the Senate to watch the opening
skirmish In the Senatorial battle of
ballots. Governor Pardee's family ar
rived early and among the Senatorial
candidates were Knight and Fisk, who
chose to observe the proceedings from
the height of the gallery. Dibble re
inforced Knight and was surrounded
by the leading supporters of other
candidates, Walter Parker being prom
inent among the Flint contingent.
NOMINATES BARD.
Promptly at noon a resolution call
ing for the election of a United States
Senator to succeed Thomas R. Bard
was read and this was followed by a
recital of the law under which the
Senate was about to proceed. This
formality concluded Senator Chester
.Rowell of J?'resno rose to place the in
cumbent, Senator Bard, In nomination.
Senator Rowell read his nomination
speech, which, in part, was as follows:
"Six years ago I presented the name
of Thomas R. Bard in this Senate
chamber as a candidate for United
States Senator. At the close of that
long and memorable contest, which
ended in his election, I promised for
him a faithful and intelligent atten
tion to duties, a statesmanlike judg
ment on national and international
questions, fidelity to every interest of
California, and courteous and generous
personal treatment of all Republicans,
regardless of factional affiliations. 1
predicted for him high standing among
his associates at Washington. My
promises and predictions have been
fully realized. Almost from the mo
ment of his advent in the Senate his
influence in both great and small af
fairs has been evident.
"Senator Bard has earned a re-elec
tion. His election would heal factional
differences. It would satisfy every
business interest of the State. It
would reinforce our delegation in Con
gress and strengthen the national ad
ministration at Washington in ail its
efforts for good government. It would
be creditable to the Republican party.
It would confer honor upon Senator
Bard and reflect honor upon the State.
His defeat will cast a shadow upon
Republican politics in this State that
will take a generation to efface.
"Successful or defeated, he will re
main the foremost citizen of California,
noble in character, strong in his adher
ence to absolute right and honored by
every high-minded citizen of Califor
nia.
"Mr. President, Senator Bard's friends
and the people of California await the
outcome of this contest with faith in
his ultimate vindication and election.
Again I present the name of Thomas
R. Bard."
PRAISE FOR SENATOR.
Senator John N. Anderson of Santa
Ana seconded Senator Bard's nomina
tion and spoke impressively. "It is fit
ting, that the voice of the south be
heard seconding the voice of the north,"
he said. "I know of no man better
qualified to represent California in the
Federal Congress than is Senator Bard,
and I hear the call from across the
Rockies asking that he be returned.
It will be a shameful disregard of the
voice of the people if he is not sent
b.ack to complete the labors he has so
well begun, and I appeal to all of you
loyal Californians to lay aside your sec
tional prejudices and vote for the man
that brought harmony and will pre
serve it in the party of this State; and,
not only that, but I ask you to vote for
the man that served California honor
ably, against whose work no man can
complain and who in all justice and
right should be encouraged by the ap
proval of this body he so richly de
serves."
Senators Belshaw and Broughton also
seconded the nomination of Senator
Bard, paying tribute to his sterling
qualities and honorable record in Con
gress.
SELVAGE'S SPEECH.
George A. Knight was next placed in
nomination by Senator Selvage, who
said, in part:
â¢ "The most important duty imposed by
the constitution upon the Legislature
now confronts that body. We must
here elect a Senator who shall rep
resent our State in the Congress of the
United States for the next six years.
That we perform that duty well is de
manded of us alike by the people of
the State and of the nation. What we
do here in this relation may either re
flect credit upon us and be productive
of good, or it may bring upon us dis
credit and be productive of evil."
Senator Selvage went on to say that
the place, should go to a candidate
representing the northern portion of
the State, saying:
"In measuring the relative Impor
tance of the territory south and north
qt the Tehachapl, I find the south to be
about one-fifth In assessable property,
one-fourth in population and one
fourth in extent and about that rela
tion In Republicanism.
"George A. Knight is the man whc
can represent the people of California
in the halls of Congress better than
any other man who lives to-day on the
Pacific Coast. He possesses every
quality in a high degree to make him a
great representative of our people."
In his peroration Selvage paid a high
tribute to Knight's speech seconding
the nomination of Roosevelt for Presi
dent and in his closing sentence said:
"I therefore nominate for United
States Senator to represent this State
in Congress our most brilliant, most
popular and honored citizen of Cali
fornia, George A. Knight."
Senator John B. Irish was the first to
second Knight's nomination and was
followed by Senator Ralston, who made
an extended argument in support of his
contention that Knight should be re
warded for his long and efficient ser
vice in behalf of the Republican party.
HAHN FLINT'S SPONSOR.
Senator Benjamin W. Hahn of Pasa
dena placed Frank P. Flint in nomina
tion, his address being entirely matter
of-fact and dispassionate. In part he
said:
"The constitutional requirement of
representation is the embodiment of the
fundamental truth, that to properly
represent, one should properly know
what he represents. This is a crys
tallization of the idea that the man
should be intimately associated with
the people; conversant with and pos
sess as thorough a knowledge as pos
sible of ail the actual existing condi
, tlons that prevail in the locality that
he is chosen to represent.
"The great commonwealth of the
south has needs particularly its own.
Her fruit interests alone are clamoring
for an alert, vigorous and loyal pro
tector. From the stalwart ranks of her
citizenship she presents for your con
sideration a man, young in years,
strong and resourceful in his mental
equipment;broad in his sympathies, one
who represents in his great-hearted,
broad-minded development and domi
nant characteristic of the ideal suc
cessful man, that keynote of the high
est character and great abilityâthe
saving grace of common sense. He is
part and parcel of our State's growth
and development, having come here
when three years of age.
"Politically he has always been a Re
publican, casting his .first vote for that
matchless statesman* and ideal Repub
lican, James G. Blame, and ever after
at the roll call of our party when there
was need of brain, unfailing energy
and devotion, in clear ringing tones has
been heard the steady response uf one
whose faith and loyalty ought never to
be questioned.
"I have the distinguished honor of
placing in nomination a citizen familiar
with all the great and diversified inter
ests of our State, one who will make a
fit and worthy co-laborer with the Hon.
George C. Perkins in the Senate of the
United States, one who, if elected, will
recognize no north, no south, but will
strive with the highest purposes of his
soui to preserve the luster of the one
bright resplendent star that represents
California to-day upon our national
emblem.
"I present that high-minded Chris
tian gentleman, that ideal Republican,
that forceful character, thai splendid
embodiment of strict integrity and
American manhoodâFrank B. Flint."
Senators A. K. Muenter of'Stockton
and Hamilton A. Uauer of San Fran
cisco seconded Flint's nomination,
neither making any greater attempt at
oratorical effort than did Hahn.
FISK IS NAMED.
Arthur G. Fisk was nominated for
Senator by Senator Wolfe of San Fran
ce i*c:o. Woife said in part:
"For the fourth time in my life
something that does not happen to
many menâl arise on the floor of the
Senate to participate in the election of
a gentleman to the, high and exalted
position of United States Senator from
the State of California. The eyes of the
world are on this State. We have
grown in population and our natural
resources are attracting the attention
of the world. I am not exaggerating
when I declare that the State of Cali
fornia is destined to be one of the
greatest States of the Union.
"It is therefore meet and proper that
this great State of ours should be rep
resented in the Senate of the United
States by a man of vigor, energy and
ability. He should, to my mind, be a
man of the people, who should know
their wishes and wants and be ever
ready to meet their demands. He
should be a man whose first duty and
first consideration will be representa
tion of the people, and who will be
ever ready to further the interests of
his constituency.
"I have in my mind the name of a
man who, in my humble judgment, will
meet all these requirements. Strong in
intellect, well equipped by nature, a
man of the plain people, who has spent
nearly his Whole life in this State, and
one who if elected to this high office
will be ever faithful to the peode of
this State, and yet will never forget
the men who helped to elevate him to
this exalted position. He will be close
to the administration. He will stand
by and back up the policy of President
Roosevelt, for to that foremost man of
this nation he is no stranger, having
already received recognition at his
hands which bears testimony to his
personal worth.
"I present for your consideration for
the high office of United States Senator
a man who once filled the position of
Speaker of the Assembly and who is
now the Postmaster of San Franciscoâ
the Hon. Arthur G. Fisk.'
Charles M. Shortridge and Henry W.
Lynch seconded Fisk's nomination,
both rising to the heights of eloquence
In the performance of the formality.
The most picturesque address of the
day was delivered by Senator J. B.
Sanford of Uklah, leader of the Demo
cratic minority, who nominated Con
gressman Theodore Bell of Napa for
Senator. E. J. Emmons of Bakersfleld
seconded the nomination of Bell and
concluded \he day's oratory. The vote
waÃ then called for.
When the Senate assembled this
morning at 11 o'clock the Committee on
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 11. 1905.
T
Fruit and Vine Interests, to which had
been referred a concurrent resolution
relative to the levying of a minimum
tax upon the grape brandy now used
in the fortification of sweet wines with
in the United States, amounting to
twenty-five cents per proof gallon, re
ported In favor of the adoption of the
resolution. The resolution requests the
members of Congress to oppose the
enactment of the law proposed
by Internal Revenue Commissioner
Yerkes, levying a tax upon the
grape brandy now used in the fortifi
cation of sweet wines manufactured
within the United States.
Senator Wolfe opposed the amend
ment because it made a request of
members of Congress, particularly in
the Senate, instead of directing them
to act. Senator Shortridge also op
posed the amendment for the same
reason, but notwithstanding this op
position it was adopted.
Senator Keane of San Francisco pre
sented a petition urging the appropria
tion of money to provide two statues
of famous Californians, to be placed In
niches provided in the rotunda of the
Capitol at Washington. The petition
does not suggest any names of Cali
fornians to be honored. The names of
6000 Native Daughters of the Golden
West are attached to the petition.

Forest Groveâthe first It will ever

to bring suit to prevent the locating
of a saloon on lands once held in trust

Sifver-Tonaued Bofons Praise Asp rants
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 10.-âFlint 31, ,
Bard 16, Knight 14, Fisk 14, Brooks
I, Bell 4.
That's the way the vote stood
when the tally was made up on the
first vote for United States Senator in
the Assembly to-day.
Never before in California has so
little interest in the election of a
United States Senator been shown in
the lower house. The gallery was not
filled and there was plenty of room
behind the rail and in the side aisles.
There was some applause for nomi
nating speeches and candidates'
names, Los Angeles people showing
the most enthusiasm, but the only
thing that approached a demonstration
was brought out by Assemblyman
Nathan Coghlan of San Francisco, who j
made the speech of the day in second- j
ing the nomination of George A. ,
Knight.
Flights of oratory from the young
men of the House were a feature of
the nominating work. Two more
stellbiders, Jones and Coghlan, were
aoded to the San Francisco list and
with McGowan and Anthony already
on the roll of ready debaters, with !
perhaps some talent yet to come for- ;
ward, it looks as if there was to be >
no lack of voice for the metropolis in ]
fhe lower house.
HOLSER'S ORATORY.
Houser of Los Angeles In making
the Flint nominating speech acquit- j
ted himself well and eloquently, ,
though he attempted a few empyrean .
flights that took away some of the ]
force of his really forceful speech and
gave, a slight suspicion of delsarte j
drilling before a looking glass. His j
address was far above the average
heard in the Assembly, though, and \
brought out much applause on its own
behalf. He said in part:
"In accordance with the requirements
of the law the Legislature is met to
day for the purpose of electing a Unit
ed States Senator. No higher duty de
volves upon us during our respective
legislative terms, and it should be with
a realization of a heavy responsibility
that we proceed to the performance of
our duty in this regard.
"Southern California, with her im
mense area, with her splendid length
of coast line, with her excellent harbors
and her varied industriesâ differing
vastly from those of the middle and
northern sections of the State, needs
and is entitled to represent her in the
United States Senate a man who is
fully alive to the situation.
"Such a man we have in the person
of Frank P. Flint of Los Angeles.
Broad of intellect, fined with noble
purpose, a man of sterling character
and unimpeachable integrity, he is a
profound student in the law and has an
accurate and scientific knowledge of
"In behalf of the district I represent,
in behalf of the vast majority of the
citizens of the peerless city of Los An
geles, in behalf of the imperial county
of Los Angeles, I have the honor to
present for your consideration as a
candidate for the high office of United
States Senator the name of Frank P.
Flint."
Dorsey, who is one of the brightest
of the young men in the House, also
acquitted himself admirably in sec*
onding Bard.
Much interest was manifested in the
vote of the Alameda delegation, as it
was supposed to give an idea of ad
ministration strength. Assemblyman
Waste's vote was awaited with es
pecial expectancy, for this reason. He
has at no time previous given an ex
pression of choice for Senator. When
"Pop" Bliss cheered Houser's speech,
the belief that he would vote for Flint
was made a certainty. Bates also ap
plauded the mention of Flint's name,
but he cast his vote for Fisk.
WASTE FOR FLINT.
Waste quietly replied "Flint" when
the clerk reached his name.
For some days there had been
doubt as to who would nominate Bard.
The choice fell upon Assemblyman
Perkins last night. His was the short
est speech made.
"I take pleasure in presenting the
name of an esteemed gentleman for the
high office of United States Senator. I
have known this gentleman for many
years and have been clo-sely identified
with him socially, as well as in a busi
ness way. , I now name the Hon. Thom
as R. Bard."
The name of Henry T. Oxnard was
not presented.
To Assembiyman Hawkins fell the
honor of placing Theodore Bell in
nomination for the Democratic minor
lty -
The call for nominations was made
shortly after noon, the Assembly hav
ing spent an hour in receiving bills.
KNIGHT IS NAMED.
Assemblyman Kolley of Humboldt
in nominating Knight said:
"it affords me keen pleasure to
have the privilege and the honor of
placing in nomination for the most
exalted legislative position in the
world a gentleman who is the peer of
any man in California. I am more
than pleased that the opportunity is
afforded me to nominate for United
States Senator a citizen from Califor
nia who is known to the people from
one end of the State to the other. It
is our solemn duty to elect a man
who is broad enough to represent the
entire State of California; a man
who knows California and who is
known by her people from San Diego
to Del Norte, and from the Pacific to
the Nevada line. Have we such a
man? Yes. and the man is Theodore
Roosevelt's personal friend, George
A. Knight of California.
"Gentlemen of the Assembly, it is
my opinion that of all the men who
have been suggested for election as
United States Senator by this Legis
lature, cither through the press, by
the public speakers or by the private
citizens, George A. Knight is the
first and real choice of a great major
ity of the citizens of the State. George
A. Knight is a man known not only
to all of California, but throughout
this great country of ours.
"In campaign following campaign
for the last thirty years George A.
Knight's eloquent voice has been
heard from the party platform in
city, town and hamlet throughout
every section of this Immense State.
Without party reward or official rec
ognition for more than a quarter of
a century he has gladly given to the
Republican party his able services.
"We of California rejoiced that
whon the Hon. Theodore Roosevelt,
President of these United States, de
termined to select a man from the
Great Weft to second his nomination
at Chicago, George A. Knight was the
man of his choice.
"In conclusion I submit that from
fhe standpoint of personal ability,
from the standpoint of party ser
vices and from the standpoint of
obedience to the voice of the people of
California, we should elect George A.
Knight as United States Senator from
California."*
JONES NAMES FISK.
Jones, In his nomination of Fisk,
spoke in a clear, carrying voice that
reached every ear in the Assembly
room. He showed some nervousness
at the start, but this passed away. It

was his maiden speech in the Assem
bly, and the honor of nominating a
candidate for United States Senator
was an important one. He said, in
part:
"It is vitally necessary that Califor
nia be ably represented in our national 1
law-making body, especially in the up- j
per house. We have gathered here to- J
day to elect such representative of this (
great commonwealth.
"The importance of his duties re- i
quires that he be a man of marked
ability. It is not necessary that he be
an orator, but he must be a clear
thinker on broad lines, able to battle ,
successfully with the shrewdest fight- j
ers of this nation. He must have
power, energy and endurance to ac- 1
complish the work expected and de- I
manded of him at this time. He must
be generous and impartial, that the
welfare cf the various sections, with
their diversified interests, are not neg
lected. The time has come for us to
unite and place the toga on the
shoulders of an able, honest, energetic I
and courageous man of experience, w ho
will fill it with honor to himself and
credit to the State. Such a man is i
genial, whole-hearted, lovable Arthur
G. Fisk.
"Members of the Assembly, with a '
full knowledge of the important duty '
pertaining to the office of a United
Stated Senator, and with supreme con
fidence in the character and ability of
the man 1 propose to you for the office, !
I place in nomination Arthur G. Fisk
as a candidate for United States Sen
ator."
Assemblyman John nominated Ben
jamin Brook of San Luis Obispo be
cause, he said. Brook had supported
him in four campaigns he had made,
and he believed in sticking to a friend. '
There were numerous seconding
speeches, some of them much longer
than the addresses of nomination. Dor
sey, In seconding Bard, said the peo
ple, after a long search, had found a
good man in the junior Senator and
that he should be allowed to retain his
seat for the welfare of the people of
California. Others who seconded Bard
were Cromwell and Johnstone.
Duryea seconded Fisk. Something of
a surprise was occasioned by this ac
tion upon the part of the last named,
as it was understood he had first had
leanings toward Knight and had then
been led over to Flint by the organiza
tion. An idea prevailed in the Assem
bly that he was only finding a resting
place and had taken occasion to say a
few nice things about his old friend,
the Speaker of the former session.
Flint was seconded by Burke of Ala
meda, Thompson and Devlin. They all
made extended speeches and said that
in Flint California would have a Sen
ator who would ably represent her in
terests.
In seconding Bell, Assemblyman Pry
or orated as industriously as if his man
were among those who had a chance.
Assemblyman Lumley applauded him
vigorously until asked by the Assem
blyman in the seat beside him what
he was making so much noise all by
himself for.
The announcement of the vote from
the desk was received with a loud cheer
by the Flint people.

TRAIN ORDERS
BY "WIRELESS"
|Two Eastern Railroads toi
Do Away With Present
System of Telegraphy
I FAR REACHING PROJECT'
Passengers May Receive Mes-!
sages While Traveling at
Rate of Fifty Miles an Hour
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 10.âArrangements
are being made for the installation of ,
wireless telegraphy on the New York
Central and Lake Shore railroads. It.
is proposed to equip the Twentieth
Century Limited and Lake Shore Lim- j
ited trains so that passengers on them
may send or receive messages at any
time, whether the train is standing still I
â or running at the rate of fifty miles j
an hour. Preliminary tests have satis- I
fled President Newman that this Is
possible with the wireless system of
telegraphy.
To provide communication with
trains in motion is only a part of the
New York Central's plans. Experi- i
ments have been made of the present
automatic block signals in combination!
with equipment for wireless telegraphy, |
whereby signals of danger have been
given in the engine cabin. This system j
of double warning to engineers will be .
I a most valuable safeguard against ac- j
j cidents and will make collisions almost'
j impossible.
Another object In installing the wire- ;
less system of telegraphy Is to be in
dependent of the present telegraph sys
tem. Storms which blow down tele
graph poles cause immense loss to rail
roads by delaying train service and In
crease the risk of accident.
If the tests made on the Lake Shore ,
and the New York Central prove sue- <
cessful, other railroads will adopt the I
wireless system.

HERRIN'S NAME ALARMS.
To-morrow will probably tell, how

forces claim will come does come, the
pleasant opportunity to speculate will

that might have a possible bearing on
the situation Is being eagerly seized
by the opposing forces, so closely are
the lines drawn.
Those that are not specially favored
by the railroad were aghast to-night
when the word went out that William
F. Herrin had arrived in the city to
direct the closing engagement of the
fight. A hurried Investigation, how
ever, disclosed the fact that the Mr.
Herrin that did arrive was not William
F. but William J.. a lawyer of San

the astute railroad manipulator. So
things quieted down to the same old
level.
PRESIDENT WITHDRAWS
LETTER TO A MAGAZINE
His Praise of Publication Used to
Promote Sales of Corpora
tion Stock.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10.âPresident
Roosevelt to-day withdrew a letter
which he wrote last March extending
to the American Newsboys' Magazine
his wishes for its success. The with
drawal of the President's letter was
announced in the form of a letter
which the President wrote on the 7th
inst. to Murat Halstead, who was
president of the company which is to
publish the magazine. The letter of
the President to Mr. Halstead follows
in part:
Dear Mr. Halstead: I am advised that you
are the president of a company formed to pub
lish the American Newsboys' Magazine and
ccntemplate withdrawing your connection
with It.
After quoting in full the letter
which he wrote last March to Colonel
E. O. Stealey, then editor of the
magazine, the President continues:
As you will note this letter Is couched In
Keneral terms, but It has been used to exploit
this company. Certain facts have come to me
as to the character of certain persons inter
ested In the corporation, as well as the meth
ods they have adopted for the disposal of
stock, which make me unwilling longer to
permit the use of my name in connection with
the enterprise. May I ask you to look care
fully Into the matter and writ* ma your views?
I will not have any letter of mine used In
connection with any concern which Is in any
way tainted, even though this letter refers
more to a general movement than to any par
ticular scheme.
In response to this letter Halstead
wrote to the President that he intend
ed to withdraw from the company.
To-day the President, In addition to
authorizing the publication of the cor
respondence, took steps to insure the
withdrawal of his letter of March last.
W. R. HEARST ARGUES
FOR LETTER CARRIERS
Congressman Says That He Considers
President's Executive Order Arbi
trary and Restrictive.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. â The
House Committee on Reform In the
Civ'l Service to-day authorized a fav
orable report on the resolution Intro
duced by Representative Hearst catl
ing on the President for "all reports,
documents, papers and orders show
ing the executive action relating to
political activity by letter carriers
mentioned in his last annual message
and the grounds therefor;" also direct
ing the Postmaster General to commu
nicate to the House all facts bearing
upon the dismissal of James C. Kel
ler, Frank Cunningham, Warren
Tumber and H. W. Aldrlch and the
grounds for their dismissal.
Hearst was heard by the committee.
He thought the President's executive
order prohibiting political activity
was ''arbitrary and restrictive." It
abridged not only the conduct of car
riers, he said, but also the conduct of
memters of Congress. Personally, he
liked to talk with the carriers from
his district and in his opinion the suc
cessful Congressman was the one who
met their demands properly.

Sacramento's Chief of Police
Says That the Sensational
Drama Demoralizes Youth
CRITICIZES NEWSPAPERS
Believes Too Much Promi
nence Is Given to Ac
counts of Criminal Acts
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 10âChief of
Police Martin Coffey, in his annual re
port to the City Board of Trustees, has
made several declarations which have
aroused no end of comment. Crime
among juveniles has been rampant here
of late and he ascribes this fact partly
to the presentation of such plays as
'â¢Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman," by
Kyrle Bellew. The chief declares all
such dramas should be denied a license
to play in Sacramento. He asserts that
Spencer Kendall, sent to the Prescott
School.of Industry for robbery, told
him he was an usher at the Clunie The
ater when "Raftles" was produced and
the witnessing of that play led him to
go out, buy a revolver and rob a drug
store.
Chief Coffey declares that the Tele
phone Exchange offices and department
stores are nothing more than kinder
gartens of vice for young girls, whose
poverty is daily thrown into contrast
with the apparent splendor of women
of questionable character who go into
the stores to buy. The chief asserts
that the telephone girls hear all man
ner of evil things over the line. He
adds that the scare headlines in a por
tion of the daily press should be for
bidden, and mentions two cases where,
he says, citizens killed Innocent men
whom they mistook for burglars while
excited over sensational accounts of
burglaries in the papers.
Colonel H. Weinstock, senior part
ner of the department store firm of
Weinstock, Lubin & Co., to-day said
that Chief Coffey had inflicted a great
wrong upon many pure and high-mind
ed women employed In the stores.
Members of the large dry goods Arm of
Wasserman, Kaufman & Co. declared
the chief's statements were too ridic
ulous for .attention.
Coffey stands by his declarations,
however, and says he Is going to call
upon the women's clubs to act on the
alleged evils, and that he intends to
restore the old curfew law and ring a
general alarm bell which will have the
effect of sending all youngsters ( home
and to bed at 8 o'clock.
HEINZE FAILS
TO SELL MINES
Admits Futility of His Ne
gotiations With the Amal
gamated Copper Company
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUTTE, Mont., Jan. 10.â F. Augustus
Helnze to-day testified in the suit
brought by the Boston and Montana
Mining Company of the Amalgamated
Copper Corporation to recover $6,000,
--000 for ore alleged to have been stqlen
from the Boston and Montana Com
pany's properties adjoining the Minnie
Healy, that he had made an effort to
dispose of all his mining properties in
Butte to the Amalgamated Copper
Company, conducting his negotiations
with Charles F. Gates In New York
City, Gates acting as agent for H. H.
Rogers. Helnze had expressed his will
ingness to sell all his properties, giv
ing Gates a list of every mine owned
by him, in order to put an end to the
copper war between himself and the
Amalgamated Company, which had in
volved the expenditure of many mil
lions of dollars. Rogers, however, dal
lied with him, trying "to work a bunko
and blackmailing turn" upon him, to
use Helnze's words. ,
Helnze declined to answer certain
questions relative to the affairs of the
Minnie Healy mine operations, or
pleaded forgetfulness. Helnze said he
did not know the officers of the Minnie
Healy or the Johnstown companies,
though he had bought the Minnie
Healy claim for the Johnstown people
because he considered It "good for the
purposes of litigation." He acknowl
edged having signed checks for the
Minnie Healy Company, but he did so
without authority from any one. He
could give no clew to the actual Iden
tity of those operating the Minnie
Healy on which court summons could
be served.

STRIKES GOLD
RIGHT IN TOWN
Old Miner Digging Cellar in
Sparks, Nevada, Uncovers
Quartz of High Value
FIND CAUSES A STIR
Sand Taken From Excava
tion and Panned Yields
Richly in Yellow Dust
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, Nev., Jan. 10.âWhile exca
vating for a cellar in the new railroad
town of Sparks to-day Earnest Vans,
an old miner from California, dug up
several .pieces of gold-bearing quartz
float. This excited him and he con
tinued to dig and in a short time un
covered more rock of the same nature.
The ore is very rich and in some
pieces of it the gold can readily be
seen. The sand in which the rock was
imbedded was black and, upon being
panned, gave high values in the pre
cious metal.
The old man searched for hours for
a ledge, but could find only a narrow
stringer of ore, which gave high values,
but which appeared to be isolated from
any other gold-bearing ore. The dis
covery created considerable excitement
in the town, and also In Reno, but as
the property is owned by A. A. Hib
bard of this city, no claims have been
located as yet. Specimens of the ore
are now on exhibition in this city.
STEAMBOAT STRIKES A ROCK

The steamboat Regulator took the
passengers off the Dalles City and
proceeded up the river to The Dalles.

Portland Sheriff Brings the
Ring to Justice and Thus
Ends Long War in Oregon
ACCUSED PLEAD GUILTY
Fines Are Imposed and the
Suits Filed Against the
Officer Are Withdrawn
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Jan. 10âThe Portland
Club has capitulated and Sherfff Wdrd
has won a victory. Pleas of guilty
have been entered In the gambling
cases, lines imposed, damage cases
against Sheriff Word brought by the
owners of the Portland Club have been
withdrawn and the warfare that has
attracted attention throughout the
entire coast will come to an end. Gam
bling will not henceforth be carried on
at the club, the owners having pledged
themselves to that effect, and the sa
ioon connected therewith will be per
mitted to open.
The most powerful force of the lo
cal army of gamblers has been the
Portland Club, located at Fifth and
Alder streets and owned by Peter
Grant, Nathan Solomon and Harvey
Dale. Two political campaigns have
been fought based largely upon the
arrangement effected with the Port
land Club and the machine, and it has
been believed by informed politicians
that the worsting of the Portland Club
would be the shattering of the ma
chine.
Not alone the Portland Club, but the
other big gambling houses were press
ed to close. Chinese fantan games and
poker games in several places were
raided and arrests made.
Stopped from gambling, the owners
of the Portland Club, In retaliation,
caused the Institution of suits to re
cover large damages, the aggregate be
ing about $50,000. Still later, resistance
on their part continuing, the Sheriff
took away the gambling apparatus
from the Portland Club and stored it
at the Courthouse.

MURDER ENDS
ALASKAN FEUD
Capitalist Robert Ball of.
Seattle Kills William
Deppe, His Former Partner
HIS WEAPON A RIFLE
Slayer Claims to Be Ann
Arbor Graduate and Once
Lived in San Francisco
SEATTLE, Jan. 10.âWord was re
ceived here this evening of the killing
of William Deppe by Robert Ball, on
Fox Island, in Southeastern Alaska,
on the evening of January 2. The
principals in the tragedy were, until
a few days ago, friends and associates
in some marble properties located close
to the scene of the shooting. They
had a business disagreement, which
resulted in a personal encounter in
this city In which Ball was worsted.
Since that time they have been bitter
enemies and it is said each had made
threats to kill the other.
Ball was, until last October, presi
dent of the Great American Marble
Company, a concern capitalized at
$70,000,000. He was deposed in Octo
ber, but he still claimed an Interest in
the property and early last month
sailed for Alaska in order to protect,
as he claimed, his legal rights. Deppe
followed a few weeks later and ar
rived on the Island the night before
the shooting. He went to a cabin ad
joining that of Ball and later went to
the cabin occupied by Ball for the
purpose, as companions who accom
panied him say, of having a talk rela
tive to the claim. Deppe was ordered
out of the place and when he stopped
to remonstrate Ball picked up a rifle
and fired. Deppe fell, dying Aye min
utes later. Deppe's body was taken to
Wrangel, where the authorities were
notified, and officers left for the scene
of the shooting to arrest Ball.
Considerable mystery enshrouds
Ball's past life. He came to this city
about two years ago and launched out
as a capitalist and promoter. He
claimed to be a graduate of the Ann
Arbor College of Law and said that
he had practiced his profession in
New York and San Francisco.
Deppe had been a miner and pros
pector for a number of years and was
well known in Alaska. He came to
this city from lowa.
The hardest thing in the world to

TOKIO HAS CHEERING NEWS.
Learns That Kuropatkin's Army Is
Becoming Demoralized.
TOKIO, Jan. 50âInformation which
has reached certain reliable quarters
here states that the Russian generals
in Manchuria are losing confidence in
General Kuropatkin, and that the Rus
sian situation around Mukden is a seri
ous one. It Is feared that if Kuro
patkin attacks the Japanese positions
along the Shakhe River he will court
disaster, and that his further retreat
will mean the demoralization of his
army.
This information goes on to say that
there is constant bickering at Russian
Manchurian headquarters, and that
the soldiers are discontented, their dis
satisfaction beginning with the series
of retreats after the battle of Tellssu
(Vafangow) and the withdrawal from
Liaoyang, when it was believed that it
was possible to hold that place. The
climax came the Russian defeat
at the battle of the Shakhe River, fol
lowing Kuronatkin's strongly worded
order directing the forward movement,
dated October 2. This defeat brought
a storm of criticism on the com
mander in chief and resulted In dis
cord among the officers.

CATARRH OP THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and Ef
fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long
been considered the next thing to In
curable. The usual symptoms are a
full or bloating sensation after eating,
accompanied sometimes with sour or
watery risings, a formation of gases,
causing pressure on the heart and
lungs and difficult breathing, bead
aches, fickle appetite, nervousness and
a general played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the
. mouth, coated tongue and If the in
terior of the stomach could be seen It
would show a slimy. Inflamed condition.
The cure for this common and ob
stinate trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to be readily
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surfaces of the stomach. To
secure a prompt and healthy digestion
is the one necessary thing to do and
when normal digestion Is secured the
Catarrhal condition will have disap
peared, s
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
â¢ and best treatment is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase
Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux, Golden
Seal and fruit acids. These tablets can
now be found at all drug stores under
the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab
lets and not being a patent medicine
can be used with perfect safety and
assurance that healthy appetite and
thorough digestion will follow their
" regular use after meals.
Mr. R. S. Workman, Chicago, Ills
writes: "Catarrh is a local condition
resulting from a neglected cold in the
head, whereby the lining membrane of
the nose becomes inflamed and the
poisonous discharge therefrom passing
backward into the throat reaches the
stomach, this producing catarrh of the
stomach. Medical authorities pre
scribed for me for three years for
catarrh of stomach without cure, but
to-day I am the happiest of men after
using only one box of. Stuart's Dys
pepsia Tablets. I can not find appro
priate words to express my good feel

FOR CHANGE
IN TARIFF
j Will Call an Extra Session
of Congress as Early as
Possible to Revise the
Schedules Now in Force
READJUSTMENT WILL
NOT BE SWEEPING
i
President Will Press Action
to Supervise the Inter
state Freight Rates of
Railroads of the Country
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10.âPresident
Roosevelt favors the earliest possible
action looking to a revision by Con
gress of the tariff. He so Informed the
| Senators and Representatives, who
j were in conference with him at the
i White House last Saturday, and he
j has made plain his position to others
i since that conference. He will call
j the Fifty-ninth Congress into extra
[â¢ ordinary session as soon as the com
! mittees have indicated that they are
[ prepared to submit a tariff measure
t for passage.
One of those present at the con
! ference on Saturday said to-day in
j view of the many conflicting stories
â¢ published regarding the meeting, that
j the President informed them that,
I while he did not believe in any sweep
! ing revision of the tariff and would
, abide absolutely by the Judgment of
the two houses of Congress in a mat
! ter that related so particularly to
! them, yet he did think the time had
come when the schedules should be
I thoroughly examined and there should
i be a readjustment.
The President added that his own
I view was that the special session
should take place at the earliest date
lat which the committees of the two
| houses could come to an agreement.
llf they took this view, he said, he
! would hold himself ready to call the
â¢ extraordinary session at whatever
! time the members of the two commit
j tees, especially the House Committee
ion Ways and Means, should inform
j him they would be ready with their
! report.
I MAY MEET IN OCTOBER,
If Congress should act on the tariff
' question in accordance with the Presi
i dent's desire, it was made perfectly
plain to-day that the extraordinary
I session would be called to assemble
j the coming spring. It has been point- j
ed out, however, by the tariff experts
of the House and Senate that it will
require many weeks to prepare a ;
; measure for submission to the House, j
: The President realizes that there is a i
' practical objection to an early spring
session of Congress, as the members ;
iof the committees have not the time
new necessary to devote to the prep- j
aration of a tariff bill,
j So far as the President is concerned
'he would be willing to have Congress j
lin session during the summer months,
jHe has indicated his entire readiness j
j to remain in Washington next summer
if-Congress will undertake at that time
the consideration of a tariff measure,
but Congress, thus far, has shown no
disposition to accede to the proposi
tion of a hot weather session.
While no decision of a definite char*
; acter has been reached as to the time
i of the extraordinary session, it Is reas- i
onable to believe that if one should be
called to meet next autumn It prob
ably will be in October.
It was added that there is not the
least prospect of differences so radical '
arising between the President and the '
Republican leaders In Congress over!
the tariff question as to cause a split
In the party. While the President is
d%eply in earnest In his desire for tariff
revision, he regards the question as
one of expediency inasmuch as no prin
clple Is at stake.
TO FIGHT RAILROADS.
On another question, howeverâthat
of legislation relating to interstate ''
freight rates of railroads âhis mind is
auite made up. He will fight for that
legislation, and fight hard. He hopes
to secure from Congress some definite I
Action regarding that, legislation at the â 
present session, but if he does not, he !
will, bring the subject again before
Congress at the proposed extraordinary i
session and will urge with all his power i
the crystallization Into law of the rec- \
ommendations he has already made to j
Congress on that question. The freight i
rate question he does not regard as
one of expediency. He holds that It
la a subject In which a great moral
principle is involved, and one very near i
to all the people of the country. He !
regards it, in fact, as the paramount \
issue at this time.
Some concern was given at the con
ference to the subject of appropria- j
tions to be authorized at the present j
session of Congress. The President 1
cordially approved of the disposition of \
Congress to hold the appropriations j
down to the lowest possible limit, but 1
he urged very strongly that the naval i
appropriations should not be material
ly disturbed, saying that the best guar- :
antee of peace for this country lies in i
a strong and homogeneous navy, and
(hat the navy programme as mapped j
out should be carried into effect, with- '
out the dropping of a single vessel.
TIM President maintained that Con- ;
gress should authorize the construction
not merely of one or two cruisers, but 1
of battleships, and he expressed the
hone that an agreement with him in !
this regard might be reached in Con- 1
gress.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DUBLIN, Jan. 10.âRetaliation for a
! "slight put upon King Edward" is the
explanation of the interdiction of the
Jockey Club which bars Richard Croker
j from training his horses on the grounds
lof Newmarket Heath.
The newspapers here declare they
I learn from good authority that the
\ stewards are moved in their prohibi T
; tion by what they consider the pre
' sumption of Croker In bidding success
fully against King Edward for prize
i yearlings during the sale at Doncaster
lln September last. A syndicate had
been formed for the purchase of the
pick of the offerings. King Edward
and the Duke of Devonshiie were mem
bers. They were represented by Lord
Marcus Beresford, who did the bid
ding.
These details were noised about
among prospective bidders. For Eng
lishmen the hint was more than suffi
cient and they retired precipitously
from competition with the royal sports
man. Not so Croker. With the bull-
I dog determination that made him one
lof the most feared men In New York
politics, he entered the sale with a
determination to own the yearlings at
any price,
i The assembled quality of the king
' dom gasped with amazement when* the
American opened the bidding for Glen
cairn Maid and, after a spirited contest,
lifted his noble competitors quite out of
i the competition, taking the filly for
$16,000. The Gallinule-Tierce filly was
â  next offered, with the same result,
Croker carrying off the prize at a cost
' of $18,000.
Richard Croker has received the fol
lowing from the secretary of the Jockey
, Club In reply for an explanation of the i
j Croker asking for an explanation of the
< refusal of the Jockey Club to grant
him permision to train his horses at
: Newmarket:
, "The Jockey Club will remind you
. that the, training grounds at New
market are the private property of the
j Jockey Club and that no one is allowed i
ito train on the grounds without per- i
> mission is first asked and received. I
am directed by the stewards to In

ESCAPE AWFUL
DEATH AT SEA
Survivors of the Norwegian
Bark Marpesia Wrecked on
Christmas Day Reach Port
â¢
NEW YORK, Jan 10.âSeven sur
vivor* of the ill-fated Norwegian ship
Marpesia, which was wrecked at sea
Jon Christmas day by an explosion of
! naphtha, resulting in the death of
! eleven members of her crew, arrived
I here to-day on the steamship Trinidad
: from Bermuda. They had been rescued
]by the Danish steamship Gallia, which
happened by just at the 1 moment when
the Marpesia was blown into a shape-.
; less mass. The seven men who sur
vived the shock were taken from the
! sea, wheie they had sought the only
iefuge that remained to them after the
J explosion. They were landed at Ber
muda by the Gallia, which was bound
! from Hamburg for Savannah,
i The Marpesia sailed from New York
i for Cette, France, on December 9 with
' a cargo of naphtha, and had been out
: only a day or two when her troubles
began. One gale succeeded another,
i but all were weathered safely amd
: without much damage until December
| 17. On that day the ship was battered
I and knocked about in a mere iless man-
I ner. Her ventilators were carried
| away at the decks, her hold began to
i fill and the cargo of caEes of naphtha
i began to warp back and forth with
I every movement of the vessel. Soon
! the cases began to give way under the
i strain, and in a little while the freed
j naphtha was floating around on top
of the water in the hold.
Gas from the fluid accumulated
steadily, and on Christmas day the
: Marpesia was a loaded bomb, needing
i only the slightest spark to blow ' the
I structure to atoms. How the spark
j reached the highly charged hold will
never be known, but suddenly there
! came a terrific report, the forward
: decks shot up into the air with a crash
I and a roar, and in a moment the en
tire ship was wrapped in flames. Those
i of the eighteen men on board who had
! not been caught in the first burst
' threw themselves over the side of the
j flaming ship into the sea. There were
â¢ only seven, and the seven would have
i followed their companions to an early
i death had not the Gallia, which
j chanced to be in the vicinity, come to
; their aid.

UNDERWRITERS OF COAST
ASSEMBLE IN CONVENTION
Fuller Suaaests Educational Plan
PRESIDENT OF THE FIRE UNDERWRITERS' ASSOCIATION OF THE PACIFIC.
WHICH OPENED ITS ANNUAL CON VENTION IN THIS CITY YESTERDAT,
AND TWO OF ITS MOST ACTIVE MEMBERS.
At the twenty-ninth annual conven- i
tion of the Fire Underwriters' Asso
ciation of the Pacific, which opened in
this city yesterday. President J. L.
Fuller urged upon the "field men," the
experts connected with the fire under
writing of the Pacific Coast, the tak
ing of a very important step. Some
time ago the executive committee of
the association, which represents a ter
ritory extending from Montana to 1
Texas and the entire Pacific Coast, ad
vocated the formation of a federation
of insurance associations in the United ;
States, similar to those that exist on I
the other side of the Atlantic.
A federation prospers in Great Brit- ;
am and Ireland. The executive com
mittee of the Pacific Association has
already sent invitations to other or
ganizations of insurance men in the
United States, but has received no
respon?e yet to the suggestion that a j
great association shall be formed.
President Fuller reviewed the steps
that have been taken elsewhere. He
said that in comparison with the in
surance institutes of Great Britain and
Ireland none of the insurance organi
zations of the United States have ad
vanced in technical education to the
position reo.uired by the federation.
"Possibly." said President Fuller, "the
time is premature, but technical train
ing in underwriting is needed."
It was time for the subject to be
considered. Incidentally President Ful
ler gave an account of what has been
done elsewhere. This in part is as
follows:
t shall try to point out the way that has
been "blaz<vl" by our brethren tn Oreat
Britain, commencing with the institute of ac
tuaries, which was founded in 1848. While
this iiisUtute, as the nafme implies, is devoted
to life insurance, its existence and workings
influenced the formation of other life insti
tutes and also those combining Are and life,
the first of the latter class being the Institute
of Manchester, which was founded In 1873.
In the course of time nine other combined fire
and life institutes were founded, all em
bodying about the same educational scope,
which includ s a regular course of study and
examination of students.
In, 1897 these institutions, ten In number,
federated under the name of the Federation
of Insurance Institutes of Great Britain and
Ireland, which is the only federation of Insur
ance Institutes' in the world to-day.
The value that is placed upon the privilege
of being leroanlzod by this f-derated body Is
demonstrated by the action of our friends just
across the border line, in Canada, where there
are two thriving institutes, of Montreal and
Toronto. Thes=> two institutions work jointly
In the educat'ohal course and are now prac
tically members of the federated body on the
other side of the water.
PAINTS STRONG PICTURE.
President Fuller, whose address was
filled with practical thoughts from be
ginning to end. strongly recommended
the better education of the younger
insurance men in underwriting and in
whatever appertains to it, and said in
part:
Here we are, one hundred companies strong,
handling a premium income aggregating up
ward of $15,000,000 annually, without the
proper educational safeguard. Just think of
this, too, by way of comparison: The head
office staff of-one company alone constitutes
the active membership of one of the institutes
included in the Federation of Insurance Insti
tutes of Oreat Britain and Ireland. Further
more. Insurance Institute work, so far as I
can learn, is confined to the English speaking
countries of the globe and the United States
Is the only one of them not having this system
of education. Just see where we stand:
Circled around us is Great Britain and Ire
land with eleven institutes, Australia with
four. New Zealand with two. South Africa with
one and Canada with two.
In view of the foregoing, the question now
arises: Must we conUnue In the narrow path,
or shall we broaden our course and try to
keep up with the procession of educated work
ers? If the latter course be decided upon, let
us act now and have it said that the first
recognised insurance Institute founded In the
United States was established under the aus
pices Â©f the Fire Underwriters' Association of
the Pacific.
Long and earnest applause testified
to the favor that was accorded to thef
suggestions made by President Ful*
ler. A committee will consider and j
report to-day and will probably make 1
! suggestions that may lead to some
practical results.
SOME ESSAYS ARE READ.

tention of the convention. This was

lers maintained as a protection against

addiesr questions were asked by the
members of the association, who
were present to the number of about

principal essayist of the forenoon,
Used vdiagrams to illustrate.
Several entertaining themes were
treated by other members of the asso
ciation in set papers. J. P. Moore
talked about the benefits that a com

studiously inclined underwriters as a
source of necessary information. R.

Reports of Preparation for
Strife Are Confirmed by a
Letter Received in London
LONDON, Jan. 10.âThe active prep
arations already reported to have be
gun in Turkey and Bulgaria for a pos
sible war this year are fully confirmed
by a private letter received in London
from a Minister accredited to the Bal
kan courts. This Minister, who has
Just completed a tour of the Balkan
capitals, writes that the Turkish and
Bulgarian Governments are energetic
ally preparing for eventualities.
Large shipments of arms and ammu
nition have been made, and recruits
from Asia Minor are arriving at Salon
ica weekly for service in the Turkish
army. The Bulgarian and Greek bands
in Macedonia are increasing dally and
are fighting each other and the Turks.
This three-cornered guerrilla warfare
threatens to assume the bloodiest phase
In the spring.
"But," concludes the Minister,
"whether or not there will be real war
fare between Turkey and Bulgaria in
the spring I am not prophet enough to
say. Unless certain powers think the
time la opportune, war may be post
poned this year, as last, but In any
event we are a year nearer the inevit
able conflict."

IN MANY LINES.
buffers*a Little
Through Lack
of Age.
In "Mizpah," the Biblical drama by
Ella Wheeler Wilcox and Luscombe
Searelle, produced for the first time
anywhere this week at the Majestic
Theater, the playwrights have at least
chosen a theme of exceptional beauty.
It is the story of Esther, told in four
acts and nine scenes, and in rhymed
and blank verse. Mr. Searelle in a
note to me claims 12S1 of the lines, leav
ing 461 to Mrs. Wilcox's credit. He has
further furnished the incidental music
âthough he objects modestly to being
programmed âas he isâas "the musical
wizard." Mr. Searelle might perhaps
leave that safely to us. Certainly the
musical setting of "Mizpah" cannot be
harged up to any kind of wizardry.
â¢ ' The play itself is an unaffected, inter
sting, somewhat ingenuous and rather
looseiy handled presentation of the
story. It has atmosphere, a certain
< olorful orientalism, but it lacks age.
Its Persia might be the Persia of to
dayâVashti.for example, in her curtain
lecture to Ahasuerus on not being al
lowed to share the king business, is as
much the new woman of the current
comic papers as Carrie Nation. One
.gets again from Vashti a quite modern
dithyramb about the pen's might over
the sword, and so on. And the piece
lacks largely in the ancient sternness
.of fiber. Ahasuerus is more of a
charming philosopher and lover than
'warrior and king. Hainan, too, the bit
terly ambitious, in his presentment
here, with his rather childish inter
ruptions of the king's dicta, becomes
not infrequently something not unlike
the enfant terrible. As a whole, in
short, the picture does not fill the
frame.
The love interest, as might be ex
pected from the "poetess of passion,"
is heavily accented, and happily. Mrs.
Wilcox âsurely these are of the 461â
in these lines and scenes is at her
best. The scene w here Esther comes to
meet the King is the best in the play,
and handled with felicitous delicacy
and sincerity by Miss Adele Block and
J. H. Gilmour. There is the profane
love, too, of Vashti and Haman, clev
erly contrasted, and interpreted to
the' necessary degree of sultriness by
â Eleanor Gordon and Howard Gould.
". Mr. Monahan, of that queer and fla
vorful sheet, the "Papyrus," hails
â¢.Mrs. Wilcox as the leading woman
'writer of the dayâthen proceeds to say
that he means ethicist and philoso
pher. So far as literature goes "Miz
pari" does not establish Mr. Monahan's
claim. The lines have prettiness. occa
sionally strength, even occasionally
poetry, but except here lack wholly in
distinction. However, they run along
easily enough, and tell the story with
commendable clearness; and altogether,
given a scenic setting of adequate
splendorâthe Majestic is excellent for
a stock houseâwith all the luxury and
richness of detail that was expended
upon, say "Ben Hur," quicken the
action of the piece, cut judiciously,
and' you would have a play at least, as
effective as most of the biblical dramas
that have yet made their appearance.
In subject it is more fortunate than
most.
The play owes a good deal to the act
ing. Mr. Gould makes an Ahasuerus
of notable charm, his love scenes with
Esther, as before said, of sincere
and convincing beauty. His reading of
the lines lends much gYace to them.
Miss Block, as Esther, has done noth
ing so good since her Kundry. The
conception has aH the delicate woman
linessâmaidenlinessâand later the full
queenliness essential to the illusion. As
a picture Miss Block is wholly charm
ing. Is not Miss Gordon's Vashti some
what over-shrewish? And would not
her bearing a little more befit a dancer
than a queen? But Miss Gordon suc
ceeds admirably in suggesting the plot
ting and passionate woman, and she is
a stunningly handsome picture. Mr.
Gould is effective in the modern fash
lon as Haman, and Mr. Mac Vicar's
Mordecai has genuine feeling. The
nthers fill in without disaster, the hand
some costumes lending color and splen
dor to the very well-staged piece. Mr.
Searelle's music is occasionally pretty,
hut trivial in the connection.

"Hedda Gabler" at the Grand.
"Hedda Gabler" was presented at
the Grand Opera-house yesterday af

MYSTERIOUS FIRE GUTS
THREE-STORY BUILDING
â¢ Flames Break Out in Awning Factory
of Ross McMahon and $20,000
Worth of Damage Results.
Fire broke out in the tent and awn
ing factory owned by Ross McMahon,
35 Market street, shortly before 1
o'clock this morning, and before the
blaze was extinguished the three
stories of the building were badly
gutted. The loss to the building and
Its contents will probably reach $20,
--000, including the damage sustained
to the restaurant of Detjen & Men

The cause of the blaze is a mys
tery. It was discovered by a watch
man, and two alarms were sent in.
The department did good work and
kept the blaze from spreading to
nearby buildings. No one was in

FORMER SAN FRANCISCO GIRL
WHO IS WITH THE SILVER
SLIPPER COMPANY.
Dancing Wins
Her Place in
Sextette.
In the ranks of the sextet of dancing
girls, who perform the sensational
champagne dance in the "Silver Slip
per," which will be seen in the Grand
Opera House next week, is a little
American girl who was born and bred
in San Francisco. Her name is Gladys |
Turner, and she will certainly demon
strate that dancers of the highest or- i
der can be found in America. It is no
longer necessary to bring them from
England.
One of the English dancers of the
sextet was taken sick the fore part of
the season and Mr. Fisher was at a loss
to know how to fill her place.
Miss Turner learned of the va
cancy, made application for the
position, was accepted, and it is safe
to say she can hold her own with any
of the other dancers, who are grad
uated from the famous George Ed
wards English school of dancing.
Miss Turner has not been seen iff San
Francisco since she has acquired a
stage reputation. Her return to the
city of her birth will prove a delight to
her many friends.
FAMOUS DIVAS
IN A QUARREL
Madame Eames' Shapely
Hand Smites Face of
Madame Senger Bettaque
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 10.âAt the re
hearsals of "Lohengrin," in the Metro
politan Opera-house, Mme. Emma
Eames and Mme. Senger Bettaque
quarreled about the superiority and
rank of their respective roles. Mme.
Eames gave her rival a sharp slap on
ihe face.
"Ladies!" called out the director.
Mme. Senger Bettaque began
searching in her pocket, but when
her hand came into view happily it
held nothing more formidable than a
book of rules compiled by Frau
Cosima Wagner for the festival house
at Bayreuth. One rule provided:
"If the soprano should slap the face
of the contralto the soprano should
apologize on her knees to the contral
to and pay fine of 500 marks."
"You shall apologize on your knees
to me, M'r=s Touch-Me-Xot," she con
tinued, "and pay $100, Miss Yankee."
"You are not a contralto. I would
apologize if you were. And we are
not at Bayreuth." said Mme. Eames.
"And I shall not go on my knees ex
cept to thank the Lord that I am a
Yankee instead of a Dutch woman."
But Mme. Eames was finally made
to apologize, nevertheless.
BANKERS SAY THAT STORY
OF SALE IS UNTRUTHFUL
Bank of California Has Not Bought
London and San Francisco
Bank, Limited.
Manager Anderson of the Bank of
California and William Mackintosh,
manager of the London and San Fran
cisco Bank, Limited, denied positively
yesterday that there was any truth
in a published story that the Bank of
California had purchased the London
and San Francisco Bank. Manager
Mackintosh said that the statement re
garding the sale that has appeared In
print was mendacious and asserted
that there has been no sale to either
the Bank of California or any other !
bank. He also said that the story of
sale was ridiculous for the reason that
directors of British banks cannot sell
without the consent of the share
holders. More than one-third of the
shares of the London and San Fran
cisco Bank are held in this city. Hence
there could be no sale, as it would be
necessary to give notice publicly to
the shareholders before asking their
consent to such a transaction.

LONDON SHOWN
ON THE CANVAS
Burton Holmes' Travelogue
on Great Metropolis Pleases
Vast Audience at Lyric Hall
i
â¢TALK IS INSTRUCTIVE
â¢
i Pictures of Queen Victoria
and King Edward Are
Cheered With Enthusiasm
I â¢
'"In London" was the travelogue of
' Burton Holmes at Lyric Hall last
' night. The familiar scenes of the
world's great metropolis were loudly
j applauded as they rolled upon the
! canvas.
For those who have had the good for
tune to visit that wonderful city the
exquisite views at last night brought
I back the scenes with great vividness.
;It w r as almost like being in London
again. For those who had never been
in that city the travelogue was a liber
al and thorough education.
The 154 scenes displayed represented
selections from every portion of that
greac city. West End, East End, slums,
houses of parliament, parks, museums,
palaces, law courts, Bank of England,
precessions and galleries were all ex
quisitely illustrated by pictures that
were the very gems and perfection of
the photographers' art.
Many of these were exquisitely col
ored. Besides these, there were nine
teen motion pictures. They represent
led coronation processions, Petticoat
! Lane, the East End Ghetto, Hyde Park,
May fair, the Sunday church parade,
j changing of the guard at St. James
i Palace and the trooping of the color.
The picture of the precession of
i Queen Victoria's jubilee evoked much
j enthusiasm. As het Majesty appeared
;in an open carriage bowing to the
j throngs of people that lined the streets
; the audience broke into prolonged
; cheering.
The picture representing King Ed
; ward on his way to the coronation was
a splendidly arranged affair. As the
King appeared in the royal gilded
| chariot, drawn by twelve magnificent
white Arab chargers, he received a
great volley of applause. Lord Roberts
was also similarly honored, as he ap
peared In one of the passing pageants.
The lecture or talk of Mr. Holmes
I was in itself a great treat. He graph
ically described every picture in a high
|ly comprehensive manner. Dashes of
: sparkling humor were frequently in
' terspersed throughout his interesting
, remarks. The hall was packed to its
greatest capacity. Applause was fre
quent and spontaneous. "In London"
: will be repeated again to-night, and
next to seeing London itself, comes
Burton Holmes with his travelogue.
CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
ENTERTAINS ITS FRIENDS
Basket Ball Games and Wrestling
Contests Excite the Large Crowd
In Attendance.
The Young Men's Christian Associa
tion gymnasium held an overflowing
crowd last night on the occasion of
the first ladies' evening given by that
organization this year. The enter
tainment provided for the guests con
sisted mainly of athletics, the features
of which were several wrestling
matches and basket ball contests be
tween teams of young women ' and
young men. In the wrestling tourna
ment R. E. Barney of the Y. M. C. A.
and C. D. Pentony of the Olympic
Club strove for the lightweight hon
ors, the former being awarded the de
cision. In the middleweight contest
G. F. Anloff of the Reliance Club of
Oakland defeated Edward Mistelskl
of the Y. M. C. A. In the heavy- j
weight match Emil Tshumi of the
Olympic Club scored over George Pi- 1
per of the Y. M. C. A.
An event of the evening that
aroused much interest was the contest
between the young ladies' basket ball
teams of San Mateo and San Fran
cisco, ending in a hard earned victory
for the San Mateo maidens, with a
score of 14 to 6. In the basket ball
game between the Titans and the Re
liance Club team the first half ended
in a score of 9 to 7 for the latter, but
the final score was changed to 18 to 10
in favor of the Titans. Between the
main events of the evening the ladies'
class of the association gave an in
teresting drill and a trio, composed
of William Hewer, Benjamin Mor
gan and Harry Weingard, entertained
the gathering with a number of acro
batic feats.

SLAVE GIRLS SENT
BACK TO CHINA
Moon Tin Escapes a Policeman Armed
With a Warrant For Her Arrest
For Larceny.
Ah Wong and Ah Lee. Chinese
women, were deported on the steam
ship China yesterday. They had at
tempted to gain admission to this
country on the representation that
they were the wives of merchants
domiciled here. They were denied a
landing and took an appeal to the
Secretary of the Department of Com
merce and Labor. Pending the ap
peal they confessed that they were
slaves. On the same vessel went Woon
Tin. a slave girl who had been res
cued from her keepers by Mies
Wheeler of the Presbyterian Mission.
Just before the steamer started a i
policeman arrived with a warrant for 1
her arrest on a charge of larceny. He
brought with him a Chinaman who
was to point out the girl, but the
Customs Inspectors would not allow .
the Chinaman to go on board, so the
girl escaped.

COILS TIGHTEN
AROUND WYMAN
Testimony of Expert Kytka
Is Strong Blow to Case
of the Alleged Stuffer
SIGNATURE IS DENIED
! S. 11. Mann Declares That He
| Did Not Vote at Elec
tion Held on August 9
The strongest testimony yet submit
ted against Charles Wyman, accused
of voting fraudulently, was presented
yesterday in Judge Lawlor's court by i
Theodore Kytka, handwriting expert.
Kytka declared in a positive tone that j
the name of S. H. Mann on the roster |
of the Seventy-third Precinct of the
Thirty-ninth District was in the hand
writing of the defendant, Charles Wy- !
man.
When the prosecuting attorney asked
the question, "Did the same person who
wrote this affidavit write S. H. Mann, j
26078 Post street," Wyman craned
forward in his seat and a hush fell j
over the courtroom. "Yes, sir," replied !
Kytka, decidedly. Wyman drooped his '
head and paled slightly. The strongest
bolt of the prosecution had reached
home.
The expert started to show the points
from which he drew his concusllons by
means of a blackboard, but darkness
Intervened. He drew a fac simile of j
the W in the ordinary Wyman slgna- j
ture on the blackboard and compared
It with the M in Mann.
"The initial strokes in both letters I
are identical," declared Kytka. "The M '
1n Mann is the characteristic Wyman j
W with a final stroke."
"See," he exclaimed, dramatically, "I
erase the final stroke and we have the
Wyman W." The roster containing the
alleged signature of S. H. Mann and
examples of Wyman's handwriting
were passed to the jurors.
S. H. Mann took the stand early in
the afternoon and declared that he did
.not enter his name in the roster of the
Seventy-third Precinct on August 9. In
the cross-examination Mann admitted
(hat he had been employed by Fairfax
Wheelan subsequent to the primary l
election. Attorney Countryman offered
as evidence a receipt for $3 obtained
from Wheelan and bearing Mann's sig
nature.
"Why did you hire this man?" was
asked Fairfax Wheelan.
"I wanted to make sure that he
would not be captured by the defense,"
replied Wheelan.. "Besides, I wanted .
to get an v authentic example of his
handwriting."
"At the time you hired him did you
speak to him about the election?"
"I did not," replied Wheelan, posi
tively.
"Did you ever see him before August
9?" inquired Countryman.
"I did not." was the" answer. ,
Fair fax Wheelan's son was on the
stand in the morning and substantiated
the testimony his father gave on the
previous day. Special Policeman Jo
seph Doyle said that he saw Wyman
vote on the afternoon of August 9, but
did not know whether he voted in his
own name or used the name of S. H.
Mann.
A. R. Goechen, the ballot clerk of
the Seventy-third Precinct, declared
that ballot No. 31,328 had been voted
but said that he did not know who ]
voted it. During the examination of j
this witness Attorney Hosmer became j
impatient at Countryman's frequent ob- i
jections and displayed some temper. 1
The case will be resumed at 9:30 a. m. j
to-day, when Kytka will illustrate on j
the blackboard why he believes Wyman |
wrote the name of S. H. Mann.

Patrolman Dwyer's Mistake.
Patrolman "Jerry" Dwyer had the
dissatisfaction of seeing three men
whom he arrested dismissed by Judge
Mogan. Acting on the complaint of S.
Polemus of 137 Larkin street, who al
leged that he had been assaulted by
Harry Quig and Harry La Croux, the
officer went to the Fulton House, man
aged by ex-Superintendent of Streets
W. W. Ackerson, and there arrested
Quig and La Croux, and also took in
Ackerson for interfering. The Judge
held that the policeman had no right
to arrest Quig and La Croux without
having a warrant, as he did not wit
ness the battery complained of by
Polemus: also, that Ackerson was jus
tified in attempting to prevent the ille
gal arrests In his house. Officer Dwyer
has been long enough on the force to
know better than to do what he did.

PROPOSITION
TO BUILD BIG
CLUBHOUSE
The newest thing in feminine club
! dom is the erection of a large clubhouse
' that will subserve the purposes of all
the interested clubs in town, of which
: thera is a goodly number.
For some time Miss Ednah Robinson
j and other clever club women have been
j looking into the need and the advisa-
I bility of a general home, with a large
auditorium, cozy clubrooms, with ac
cessories for comfort and a gymnasium
and a swimming tank within.
Yesterday the presidents of nearly all
the clubs in town met and conferred
with a number of business men about
the feasibility of the plan.
The idea was unanimously approved.
| The location of the proposed building,
; however, was a matter of strong differ
ence of opinionâwhether it should be
east or west of Powell street.
The matter was laid over till the,
next conference.
The most interesting phase of the
project is the proposition to have a
swimming tank and a gymnasium ex
clusively for women.
That the matter will crystallize rÂ»to
something tangible is assured.

Child Restored to Father.
By order of Judge Lawlor Ellen
Harvey, the 11-year-old girl who was
kidnaped from r.edding by her
mother, was restored to the father,
William Harvey, yesterday. The Har
veys were divorced in 1897, and the
father was given the custody of four
children. Mrs. Harvey is now Mrs.
A. M. Newberg of this city. She al
leges that the father treats the chil
dren brutally and gave that as an ex
cuse for kidnaping the little girl. The
mother acquiesced in the decision of
the Judge, but declares she will take
the proper steps to obtain the custody
of little Ellen. William S. Barnes ap
peared for the father and Police Com

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
CREMATORY EXPLOSION
STARTLES WEST OAKLAND
TRY TO BLOW UP GARBAGE PLANT
/ Workmen's Lives Endangered by Fiend
. OAKLAND, Jan. 10.âLives of half
a dozen men were endangered and a
portion of the works was destroyed
last .night In a dastardly attempt to
blow up the plant of the Pacific In
â¢ icinerating Company at West Oakland.
â¢ A keg of powder was surreptitious
ly placed in one of the large combustion
â¢furnaces used to burn refuse. The
â¢ stuff exploded after the fires had been
started, partly wrecking the big brick
furnace, blowing heavy iron caps off
the air vents, smashing the large Iron
grate bars and sending a rain of brick
and iron over the men who were work
ing on the platform above the fur
.' naces.
For weeks the employes of the com
pany had been closely, watching for
some such culmination of the bitter
warfare that has been waged between
the company and the scavengers. The
officials of the plant admit that they
have no proof as to the perpetrators of
the powder plot, although their sus
picions are directed against individ
. uals because of threats which have
been repeated as having come from
disgruntled persons.
CALL FOR BIDS
ON NEW SCHOOLS
Board of Education Moves
Toward the Construction
of First of the Edifices
â¢ Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 10.
The Board of Education has called
for bids for construction of the foun
dation of the new Franklin school in
East Oakland, the first of the buildings
'. to be erected with money raised by the
. recent $1,000,000 school bond issue.
Work will be pressed as rapidly as is
consistent with the construction of a
first-clas6 edifice. The new school will
cost 1150,000.
Superintendent of Schools J. W. Mc-
Clymonds made a statement to-day
. touching the board's purpose in the
matter of new school buildings. He
said:
Work on the Franklin School, the new
building on Shattuck avenue, near Bushrod
Park, and the new edifice at Thirty-ninth and
Market streets, will be commenced at once.
The Board of Education will push the arrange
ments without delay. The new Lincoln School
cannot be started until summer vacation, be
cause It wilt occupy the site of the present
structure. Before work on the new one can
be commenced the old building will be moved.
Within a short tim* work will begin on the
additions to the Lafayette and the Grant
schools. By the opening of the summer vaca
tion we shall be roady not only to go ahead
with the Lincoln School, but with the Prps
cott and the Grove-street building. So far
.as conditions appear at present, all of this
new work should he well under way this year.
Mrs. Frank Day has resigned as a
teacher at the Central Evening School.

request of the Mayor, have removed from the

requested to take immediate action to cause
the removal from the streets and sidewalks
of all such obstructions as soon as It may be
pi*sible to secure such removal.
Resolved. That a special committee of five

The explosive was Introduced by be
ing thrown into a wagon load of refuse
while the team was on its rounds.
When the load was emptied into the
furnace the can of powder went
with it.
Shortly after the mass had been fired
the explosion occurred. The shock was
felt for half a mile around the works.
No damage was done outside of the
plant because of its isolated location.
It is the practice in handling the re
fuse to use one of the big furnaces ex
clusively for garbage. The other one
is reserved for the incineration of
other combustible matter. The powder
could not have been so readily placed
m the garbage furnace without detec
tion.
Frank Melbourne, superintendent of
the plant, declares that he has good
reason to believe that the explosive
was intended to wreck the plant. That
it did not fully accomplish the mis
creant's purpose was due to the size
of the furnace and the fact that the
force of the explosion was somewhat
broken by escape of gases through
vents.

and was sentenced by Judge Mortimer Smith.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. JANUARY 11, 1905.
Steps have been taken to run down
some clews that the company has un
covered, although the officials refuse
to say what they have learned con
cerning the identity of suspected per
eons. Melbourne said to-day:
We have long been aware ot the bitter feel
ing that exists among the scavengers concern
ing the crematory. The company which, un
der municipal ordinance, holds the contract
for exclusive handling of the city's garbage,
has tried unavallingly to make peaceful set
tlements with these men. We offered to buy
their outfits and to put them at work. After
all negotiations failed ws decided to assert
our rights in the oourts.
As a result there have been many arrests
of scavengers. The courts have been crowded
with cases. So little progress was made that
the company went to the United States oourts
to obtain injunctions against further operations
by the scavengers. This move undoubtedly
added to the feeling. I cannot fix the re
sponsibility for this outrage. I have been
afraid for months that dynamite might be
used and have been especially careful. I
hardly expected powder would be used in such
quantity as was placed in the furnace.
It's bad enough to wreck property, but I
say that terms are not strong enough to de
nounce deeds that endanger men's lives. I
serve notice now that if the man or men are
caught in the act it will be shortshift for
them so far as I am concerned.
SAYS FARMER
IS ADVANCING
President Wheeler Talks
About the Progress of Ag
riculture as a Science
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 10.
Profoundly impressed by the develop
ment of agriculture on scientific lines
in California and by the keen, intelli
gent interest manifested in the work of
that department of the State Univer
sity, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president
of the University of California, returned
to-day from a ten days' visit among the
farmers of Santa Barbara and Ventura
counties.
President Wheeler delivered an ad
dress at the Farmers' Institute at San
ta Paula, where he was in touch with
many of the leading agriculturists of
that section. His comment on his trip
follows:
The farmers of California are becoming pro
fessional men. The wide interest they are
manifesting In the scientific side of agricul
ture is becoming an important factor in the
work of tilling the soil and growing the diver
sified crops of this empire State. The farmers'
I appreciation of the importance of expert
knowledge is one of the most noticeable re
suits of the university's farmers' institutes.
This is demonstrated by the clean-cut observa
tions that are made at the lectures and the
enthusiastic concern of the audiences at the
institutes.
I remarked the careful and intelligent
thought shown by the queries of listeners at
Santa Paula. Professor Fortier was fairly
bombarded with questioTn* after he had con
cluded an address that was on cold scientific
lines. The farmer of California and of the
United States has at his command through this
great university a source of knowledge un
equaled the world over. In Europe and In
Great Britain there Is no such attention' paid
to agricultural development as is glv> n to
farming In this country. I am glad to ob
serve that our farmers realize ths needs of
the university and understand the importance
of its relation to our agricultural interests.
During his absence President Wheel
er had a conference with Governor
Pardee touching the financial interests
of the university. Of that President
Wheeler said:
Governor Pardee is In touch with our needs
and when the appropriations are made I feel
satisfied we shall receive all that can possibly
be allotted to us. Of course we appreciate
that the coat must be cut according to the
cloth.
MARIE ACKERMAN FOUND
TO BE VIOLENTLY INSANE
A Week's Residence Among Her
Friends Shows Them She Is
Hopelessly Crazy.
OAKLAND, Jan. 10.âA week's resi
dence among them was enough to
demonstrate to the friends of Miss
Marie Ackerman that she is really
j insane. The Rev. F. W. Meyer of
j East Oakland took an interest in her
| case and it was thought that owing
j to her being unable to speak the lan
guage, having recently come from
; Switzerland, she had been misjudged.
I Judge Melvin, to give her another op-
I portunity, set her commitment to
! Stockton aside and allowed her to go
j with her friends.
i This morning the Rev. Mr. Meyer
1 appeared before Judge Melvin and
asked to have her again taken into
custody. He said she had been with
his family a week and that they
could do nothing with her. She be
lieves a man is a.'ter her, and when
Deputy Sheriff Murdock went to take
her into custody she fought like a
tigress. She is again confined in the
insane ward and will be committed toy
morrow.

LIQUOR SELLER

Temperance Folk of Univer

Sam Fisher Is Defeated
WAR CLOUD DISSIPATED
Downfall of West Berkeley
Man Averts Threatened
Fight to Close Saloons
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 10.
The threatened agitation by temper
ance advocates of Berkeley of a cam
paign to close all the saloons In the
university town is not to be. since
"Sam" Fisher, the casus belli in West
Berkeley, has been denied a liquor li
cense by the Town Trustees.
Fisher, with his supporters, appeared
at the meeting of the Trustees last
night, and arrayed against him were
the W. C. T. U. folk and other tem
perance people. It had been declared
by them that if Fisher, now a liquor
seller in West Berkeley, should receive
a formal permit to dispense intoxicants,
at once the agitation for the closing
down of all saloons in Berkeley would
begin.
Fisher achieved notoriety a year ago,
when he attacked a "rummage sale"
which ladies of the Methodist church
were conducting in the storeroom ad
joining his saloon on University av
enue. He broke up the sale. He was
arrested, charged with battery, tried
and acquitted. He lost his liquor li
cense, but co'ntlnued to do business. He
applied for a formal permit, and last
night received his quietus.
Two Trustees, composing the commit
tee to which his application had been
referred, reported favorably on the
petition. The Trustees were Dowd and
Hoff. Trustee Staats was expected to
join them, but instead he advocated
appropriating $500 to pay detectives
who should procure evidence to convict
"such men as Fisher" who were de
clared to be selling liquor without li
censes.
SOCIETY FOLK
HOLD A CLOWN
FETE AT HOME
BY ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND, Jan. 10.âThe members, and
their respective husbands, of a five hundred
club were entertained last evening by Mr. and
Mrs. J. "Walter Scott. Each guest had been
requested to represent some ridiculous charac
ter and tho motley gathering that resulted
was the source of several hours of unalloyed
fun.
The hostess. In quaint, old fashioned garb,
started the" merriment aa she received each
guest. Mrs. W, A. So brock, with -#lrty face
and sticky hands, was an e'rtfant terrible, and
Mrs. Fred Morse, in black face and kinky,
braided wig. simply convulsed her fellcw guests
as Topsy. Another very funny costume was
worn by Mrs. H. B. Mehrmann, who repre
sented the regulation Irish woman of the stage,
in a bright red â¢ jersey," and ill-hanging skirt
and gorgeous hosiery.
Mrs. M. J. Laymance was "Sally in Our
Alley," and Mrs. Ernest Boyes and Mrs. Gil
bert Curtiss were both old-fashioned girls.
Mrs. Ernest Boyes, in an Immense hoopsklrt,
succeeded In being "always In the way," and
Mrs. â¢R. C. Craft, as a tough girl, certainly
made a hit. Mrs E. B. Davis was in fancy
dress.
Kot all of the gentlemen were in costume,
but those who were furnished fun enough for
all who were not. Mr. Scctt was a hunter,
Mr. Laymance a cowboy, Mr. Schrook a
farmer. Dr. Morse as Weary Willie, E. E.
Davis as a tramp and Dr. Boyes as a Dutch
comedian were a whole show in themselves. Mr.
Craft in a fisherman's costume and Mr. Curtlss
as a very ridiculous dude were also very funny.
A game of five hundred was played and the
prizes, as comical as the costumes worn, were
won by Mrs. Ernest Boyes, Mr. Craft and Mrs.
Laymance.
A bucket of water, served with a bright,
new tin dipper, furnished liquid refreshment
during the early evening, but later, when tho
tramp party was ushered to the basement,
substantial alleviation of both hunger and
thirst was found. There were tables covered
with brown paper, wooden plates heaped with
Dutch delicacies, beer In thick glasses, and
delicious coffee In still thicker cups. There
were boxes for the guests to sit on. The
name cards were very original and made pretty
souvenirs of the occasion. Tag cards, such as
are used by the express companies, were
adorned with a hobo picture and the name of
a guest written thereon.
This particular club Is one of the Jolliest In
town, and every time It meets the hostess has
some surprise In store for her associates.
* â¢ â¢
The Ebell Club luncheon was, as usual, a
brililan. affair and tie musical programme
good. Mrs. Clark 1,. Goddard was presiding
hostess and the music was under the direction
of Mrs. E. N. Ewer. The programme was
given entirely by Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Ficken
scher and was as follows:
Three Songs from Shakespeare (Helse); (a)
"Come Away, Come Away. Death," (b) "It
Was a Lover and His Lass," (c) "A Poor Soul
Sat Sighing"; (a) "Scherzo" (Mendelssohn),

Dandelion" (Chardlck), (c) "Black-Eyed Su
s*n" (Schaefer), (d) "Where Go the Beats?"

University Professor Prints
Result of His Investiga
tions Into Fruit Values
DISPELS COMMON ERROR
Scientist Declares People
Who Eat Fruit Just for
Fun Make Gross Blunder
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 10.
University students who live on
fruits, nuts and other articles of diet
prescribed by Professor M. E. Jaffa,
with other adults carrying out similar
instructions, furnished the medium for
scientific investigations of food values,
the results of which are contained in
a compilation of bulletins, issued to-day
by the agricultural department of the
State University.
Under the head of "Nutrition Inves
tigations" the university scientist gives
elaborate tables, showing In detail, by
figures, what proportion of nutriment
and life-giving power the various arti
cles of diet were found to possess. The
experiments were made on the univer
sity campus in buildings specially ar
ranged for the work. All the work
was done in co-operation with the
United States Department of Agricul
ture.
Because of California's fame as a
fruit-producing State it was deemed
desirable by those in charge of the
matter to make the examination of
foods deal principally with fruits.
Concerning this phase of the subject,
Professor Jaffa says:
Fruit is considered by the majority of per
sons as an accessory or supplementary food,
eaten for its agreeable flavor or supposed
hygienic value or medical virtues, rather
than as a staple article of diet. Perhaps for
this reason very little scientific study has
b<-en given to fruit, as compared with the
investigations which have been carried on in
count ction with other more common food ma
tennis. Chemical analysis has shown the
comparative composition of fruits, but our
knowledge of their dietetic value, digestibility
and comparative cost as sources of nutriment
is far from complete. In view of these facts
it was thought best that California should
undenake. as her phare of the nutrition in
vestigations made under the auspices of the
United State Department of Agriculture,
studies of the nutritive value and digestibility
of fruit. Perhaps no State in the/ Union
Ik in better condition to exploit such prob
lems. No month In the year finds the Cali
fornia market without fresh fruit of local
production and many people are to be found
in the State who make, this article an im
portant rart of their dietary.
VARIOUS BELIEFS.
It Is not an infrequent occurrence to see
popular articles in the dally papers and mag
azines which assert the superiority of the
vegetarian diet over the ordinary diet, or the
fruitarian over the vegetarian. The fruitar
ians claim, with some degree of justice, that
the so-called vegetarians are not true vege
tarians, but arc simply non-meat eaters. This
is certainly true of many of them, as a large
proportion Include animal products In their
dietaries, since they consume considerable
quantities of milk, butter, cheese, eggs, etc.,
and some even eat fish.
In inaugurating our Investigations It was
deemed desirable to select such subjects as
were not only accustomed to the larse use
of fruit, but whose dietaries did not contain
many other foods, fortunately subjects were
found Â» ,l to lived almost exclusively on raw
fruits and nuts.
The Investigations of fruitarians Included
(1) the study t f six dietaries whi -h, with two
exceptions were made up of fruits and nuts
exclusively (In the first case the subject ate
a small quantity of a cereal preparation, ana
in the second some green vegetables); t2) one
digestion experiment with a girl. In which
fruits and nuts constituted the entire diet;
(3) a study of the income and outgo ot nitro
gen in the digestion experiment.
A review of the results of the studies
of the fruit and nut diet is as follows,
the summary being the work of Pro
fessor Jaffa:
The high nutritive value of the fruitarian
diet Is shown most clearly in the case of th?,
university student who, though enUrely un
accustomed to such tare, gradually changed
from an ordinary mixed diet to one of fruit
and nuts without loss of health or strength.
He was able for eight days to carry on his
ksim] college work and also for part of the
time to Derform heavy physical work on an
exclusively fruitarian diet, without any ma
terial loss in weight.
While some of the dietaries prove con
clusively that it is possible to obtain the
requisite amount of protein and a proper fuel
value from a fruitarian diet, still the major
ity of those studied fell far below the tenta
tive standards. At the same time It Is not
just to ascribe this failure to the form of
diet. These same people might have con
sumed no larger quantities of the nutrients
on a mixed diet.
It would seem from the data that It was
more difficult for two of the subjects to ob
tain the requisite amount of protein when
on a limited diet of one kind of nut com
bined with fruits than it was when they
were unrestricted and ate of a variety of
each.
WANTED OTHER FOODS.
In nearly all cases where the diet was
limited in variety, the sub ect complained of
a constant craving for something else, a
green vegetable or a cereal. At such times
it was found that th* coefficients of availabil
ity were lower than those recorded when the
subject ate some little "relish" with the
fruits and nuts.
The dietaries which Included cereals yielded
better results In most cases than those which
were limited strictly to fruits and nuts.
The chief sources of nutriment in fruit are
the carbohydrates, which from the results of
the metabolism experiments are shown to
possess a coefficient of availability only slight
ly lower than that of the carbohydrates of the
mixed diet. ThiÃ would emphasize the fact
that fruit should be regarded as a valuable
part of such a diet.
The nltrsgen equilibrium in the body was
maintained in fourteen out of the thirty-one
direstion experiments, and in some cases thit
to done on a smaller amount of protein
than as usually consumed by the same sub
ject during the dietary studies.
The cost per person per day of the nine
dietary studies varied from 18 tents to 4(1
cents. '
While the writer deems It advisable to wait
until more data have been gathered before
publishing coefficients of availability for tho
different fruits and nuts, enough work has
been done to prove that they have a much
hiuher nutritive value than Is popularly at
tributed to them. And it Is certainly an error
to use nuts merely as an accessory to an al
ready heavy meal and to regard fruit merely
from the supposed hygienic or medicinal stand
point.

MARSHAL MAKES REPORT
All Night Service in Office
Ordered by Trustees to
Afford Better Protection
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street. Jan. 10.
A complete reorganization of the po
lice force of Berkeley is expected to
follow the recommendations made by
Marshal Kerns to the Town Trustees
last night, in the event of a. favorable
report from the committee to which
they were referred for consideration.
The permaneut addition of five men
to the force already employed, the in
stallation of an all-night service in
the Marshal's office, the uniforming of
the staff and a system of reports such
as prevails in metropolitan police de
partments are some of the results cal
culated upon by those who are work
ing to strengthen the Berkeley con
stabulary.
Marshal Kerns recommended last
night that he be given a new deputy,
who should serve exclusively In his of
fice at night. It was explained that
citizens now have difficulty in finding a
policeman at night when one is need
ed, as Marshal Kerns is not able to re
main at one place all night, and his
deputies are patrolling the streets. The
request was granted, and hereafter all
deputies will report each half-hour to
the office.
The Marshal desires that the four
men recently given him be retained as
permanent members of his force. These
men would doubtless be uniformed.
The Trustees will have presented to
them arguments for the retention of
the men, and it is believed that a fa
vorable report from the committee will
follow.

IS A TRAIN ROBBER
Suspected of Murder of Officer Brown
WOMAN ACCUSED OF BIGAMY AND ALLEGED TRAIN ROBBER WHOM
SHE EXPOSED TO POLICE BECAUSE HE PREFERRED CHARGE AGAINST
HER, LOVE ON EACH SIDE HAVING GIVEN WAY TO HATE.
Infatuation for a woman, and his
angry effort at revenge because she
jilted him, may prove the undoing of
lien G. Baddeley, suspected of train
robbery, and also of the murder
of Policeman George W. Brown of the
Oakland force.
â¢baddeley is in the City Prison, and
Captain of Detectives Burnett believes
him to be a desperate criminal. The
Southern Pacific detectives say they
have long had him under surveillance,
and Chicago detectives have been hunt
ing him for the hold-up of the "Dia- I
mond Express" on the Illinois Central I
Railroad in August last. The Oakland
'â¢ detectives have been at work on a
theory that it was Baddeley who killed
. Officer Brown after having robbed a
â  citizen a short time before.
I' . The prisoner walked into the meshes
of the law yesterday when he swore
to a warrant charging Minnie M. Seg
ger, with whom he formerly lived, with
: bigamy. While an interlocutory decree
of divorce from Harry Segger had sev
eral months to run. Baddeley alleged,
the woman married "Bobby" Johnson,
a welter-weight pugilist, at Modesto.
The woman turned upon Baddeley in
retaliation of his act of jealousy and
iold Captain Burnett that Baddeley
was a member* of the gang of train
â¢ ' robbers that operated so boldly last
â¢*, summer on the Rio Grande and other
roads on the other side of the Rockies.
Her story was straightforward and
plausible, and it was not long till Bad
â¢ deley was behind the bars. He laughed
at the statements of his former para
mour, declared that she had read yel
. â¢ low novels too much, and assured the
detectives that she was merely trying
to turn the tables on him. At first he
said he instituted prosecution of the
woman "in the interest of iaw and or
' der," but later he admitted that he
swore to the complaint because he
wanted to "get even" for her desertion
â¢ of him.

NEW YORK, Jan. 10.âDuring the
last five months the number of Rus
sian Hebrews arriving at this port has
exceeded that of any other nationality,
and has amounted to 75,160. The im- â 
migration officials view the situation |
with alarm. In the ten days they have
Bent back by the steamships on which |
they came 528 immigrants, chiefly on
the ground that they were "assisted."
It is claimed that many societies
exist in Europe for the purpose of i
supplying fleeing Russian Hebrews
with tickets for the United States and
coaching the fugitives to answer the
questions of the immigration officials.
. To lessen this inpour of what the
officials of the Department of Tom

I immigration the officials of Ellis Is

The flight of the Hebrews from Rus

According to the detectives Baddeley
j as a member of the train robbing gang
I was known as George Evans. Mrs.

i a short time ago. The headquarters of
J the gang were in St. Louis and their
I operations were chiefly on the Rio

Mrs. Segger was unable to go into de
i tails, for she could not remember them,
j and the three letters, in which Badde
' ley had written fully of his exploits,
j were out of her possession unfortunate

As to the Oakland murder charge,
i the detectives said last night that they
J have suspected Baddeley from the
j start but have been unable to obtain
l any evidence against him. Detective
! Holland of Oakland spent several days
i in San Francisco trying to get some
I clew connecting him with the crime.
I but was unable to do so. Baddeley has
been living at 833 Howard street with
I a man known as "Mickey." The prison
! er first said his roommate's name was
' Ed Quinn, but later changed it to
j Finn.
"I am a hard working carpenter." j
declared Baddeley in his statement
last night, and he exhibited calloused i
hands in evidence. "I am not a train
robber and have never been one. Joe
Palmer is a blacksmith and carriage- j
maker in Frankfort. Missouri, and is
an intimate friend of mine. We worked j
together on the Fair buildings in St. <
Louis, and that is where I became ac- j
quainted with him. I do not know of i
any men named Zip and Pete.
"That woman must have been read
ing too many of these yellow novels.
She is simply spinning this yarn to
get even with me. We livea together
for about eighteen months and con
ducted a dance hall at Newman. We
had a row and she gave me the worst
of it in settling up the business. All
she gave me as my share in the dance
hall was $150. I then went to St. Louis.
She was married to Harry J. Segger.
a cakewalker, at Reno five years ago.
She sued for a divorce last year in
Stanislaus County, was awarded an in
terlocutory decree, but before the year
expired and after I left her she mar
ried this prizefighter, Bobby Johnson.
Yes, it is true that I tried to play even
with her for jilting me, and this talk
of hers that I am a train robber is
only an attempt on her part to re
taliate in kind.
EXPLAINS FALSE NAME.
Asked why he lived under an as
sumed name, the prisoner said he did
so because he did not want his right
name associated with the woman's
name, nor with the line of business he
was engaged in in Newman. He denied
making claim to relationship with
Chris Evans, and gave his birthplace
as Napa. As to the suspicious letter in
Captain Burnett's possession concern
ing the growth of his beard and the
danger of being "run to earth," Badde
ley said he was merely "stringing" the
woman to hold her affection. Refer
ences to death and the coffin might ap
peal to her sentimental side he thought.
The prisoner has a scar on his arm
that Mrs. Segger says is from a buck
shot with which he was wounded in a
"get-away" from one of his crimes.
He denies this emphatically.
In searching Baddeley's effects a
newspaper clipping was found, giving
the account of the birth of a child at
San Quentin. The 1 mother was Mrs.
Worthington, who killed Harry Badde
ley at the Jackson-street wharf about
eleven years ago. The prisoner said
the victim of the murder was his
brother.
A dispatch from Modesto states that
Baddeley is wanted at Newman as a
witness against a man accused of keep
ing his wife in a house of 111 repute.
It is said that last summer Mrs. Seg
ger was living with another man, whom
she had arrested for desertion from the
army In order to get rid of him.
Bob Johnson called at the prison last
night to give sympathy and aid to his
wife. He has retained an attorney for
her. >

NEW YORK. Jan. 10.âMrs. Alice
Webb Duke, whose marriage to Brodie
L. Duke was followed by his incar
ceration in a sanitarium, intends to
fight the relatives of her husband,
who are endeavoring to have the mar
riage annulled, and has retained coun
sel and taken steps to procure his re
lease upon habeas corpus proceedings.

PANAMA RAILROAD INQUIRY.
House Committee Favors Investiga
tion of Company's Affairs.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.âThe
j House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce to-day authorized
a favorable report on the Shackelford
| resolution providing for an examina
-1 tion by that committee of the affairs
I of the Panama Railroad Company.
Shackelford said it was known that
' the railroad was maintaining offices in
New York at an expense of $200,000
: a year. It was known to at least four
teen members of the committee, he
continued, that in 1903 the directors
'of the road had declared dividends of
I between $200,000 and $300,000 in ex
| cess of the net earnings.
I The resolution recites that "the
: United States is now the owner of
' more than 98 per centum of the
! shares of the capital stock of the
! Panama Railway Company and it is
j for that reason expedient that Con
j gress should have full knowledge of
I the affairs of said company.
CURRENCY BILL DISCUSSED.
House Adopts Amendment Offered by
Minority Leader.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. âThe ses
sion of the House to-day was given
over almost entirely to discussion of
! the bill on banking and currency "to
: improve currency conditions." A sud
den interest in the measure seemed
to develop, as evidenced by the large
I membership present throughout the
j day.
Democratic opposition mainly was
I dissipated by the adoption of an
amendment offered by Williams of
Mississippi, providing that Govern
ment deposits shall be made only on
competitive bids. Final action on the
bill was not taken.
STATEHOOD BILL AMENDED.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.âThe Sen

the joint statehood bill, the chief ac
complishment being- the acceptance of
most of the amendments suggested
by the Committee on Indian Affairs.
Speeches were made by Stewart and
Newlands, the former advocating an
amendment for the protection of the
interests of the Indians In Indian Ter
ritory, and the latter favoring limita
tion of the area of lands to be soil

The bill for the reimbursement of
the American sealers for losses under
seizures in Bering Sea also was con
sidered, but a vote was not reached.

FAMED IS DUDE
OF THE ENGLISH
HOUSE OF LORDS
IyOONQ FAR!,. CONSIDERED THE
PEST PRESSED MAN IN THE
HOI SE OF lords.
fr r*
LONDON. Jan. 10. -Though he Is
only 32 years old. the Earl of Beau
rhamp is said to Dossess the distinction
i
of having made more speeches than .
any other living Englishman. There \
may be some exaggeration that, I
but it is certain that he is the most i
loquacious member of the aristocracy, i
He believes that it is his chief mission
in life to set <>ther people right by be- j
stowing upon them unlimited advice
and counsel. As it costs them nothing
for the most part they endure it good- ,
naturedly. He never lacks an opportu- !
nity to ventilate his ideas, because lords
are always in demand at public func- ,
tlons in England. It has not yet been >
noted that he has ever accomplished
anything by his oratory, but he is still
young and persevering.
The Earl is a very good-looking man.
and he knows it, too. Likewise he is
well aware that he has very shapely
hands, and they always figure promi
nently in his photographs. In his
younger days he was regarded as the
dude of the peerage and is still con
sidered the best dressed man in the
House of Lords. . .
A DEVOUT CHURCHMAN.
He is very devout and it was said
that in his early youth he had decided
to enter the ministry. He changed his ;
mind on that point on succeeding to !
the ancestral estates and titles when
only 19. He has, however, always
shown keen interest in church matters :
and only the other day he berated
church choirs and organists for being
more devoted to music than to religion
and thereby sacrificing piety to art.
When he was 27 years of age a Con
servative Government sent him to New |
South Wales as Governor of that col- j
ony. The Antipodeans, who have much j
less respect for hereditary titles than
English folk, did not take very kindly
to him. His state dances were de
risively dubbed â¢â¢Seidlitz Powder Balls"
because tickets of admission were blue
and' white. The holders of the blue
pasteboards were entitled to a better
supper than those who had been pro
vided only With white ones, and had
other exclusive privileges, too. To the
democratic colonists distinctions of
this sort savored of snobbishness and
they resented it.
FOE OF RACE SUICIDE.
The Earl did not mend matters any
hy taking them to task for their small
families and declining birth rate. That
sort of talk comes all very well from
President Roo-seveit, whose precepts are
backed up by the example his own
home furnishes of a large and healthy
family, but Australian husbands and
wives regarded it as sheer impertin
ence coming from a young peer, who
was at that time stili a bachelor, al
though he could well afford a wife.
They told him bluntly that before he
began to preach upon the obligations
of matrimony he should first get mar
ried himself, and intimated that there
were plenty of Australian girls who
were quite capable of sustaining the
title of Countess with grace and dignity
He did not profit by that hint.
It was long supposed that he would
never marry because, according to
tradition, a curse had been laid on the
family. It was directed against the
eldest son of an eldest son and de
clared that such a one would never in
herit the wealth of the family because
it had been derived from the spoils of
the church. The Earl is an eldest son,
but in 1902 he decided to risk the curse,
so far as any future heir might be in
volved, by marrying Lady Lettice
Grosvenor, a daughter of the late Earl
Grosvenor and sf sister of the second
Duke of Westminster. It was what is
called a brilliant match.

BISHOP TALBOT
MUST BE TRIED
Repudiation of Signatures
to His Presentment Does
Not Settle the Case
INQUIRY BOARD MEETS
Members Express Opinion
That Charges Stand De
spite Act of Vestrymen
READING, Pa., Jan. 10âDespite the
lack of a quorum, seven members of
the board of inquiry appointed to
probe the charges made against Bishop
Ethelbert Talbot of the Central Penn
sylvania diocese of the Episcopal
Church by L N. W. Irvine, the deposed
priest, met in this city to-day and,
after a three hours' conference, ad
journed to meet here on Friday. The
members of the committee Informally
considered the case in many of Its
phases, and, after its adjournment, it
was the consensus of opinion that ac
tion must be taken to save the good
name of the church, as well as In jus
tice to the accused prelate. The mem
bers of the board were of the opinion
that there could be no withdrawal of
the grave charges and the case ought
to be settled once and for all.
William D. Butler of Mauchchunk.
Pa., a layman of the board, who was
elected secretary, said that, not
withstanding that the Huntingdon
signers had repudiated the charges and
that the other signers had asked Bishop
Tuttle to permit them to withdraw the
accusations, the charges stood as prom
inently as ever before the members of
the board.
Butler is also authority for the state
ment that Bishop Tuttle has refused to
acquiesce in the request of the majority
lof the presenters for the withdrawal of
the charges.
"The charges once having been made
and signed," he said, "are no longer
. the property of the presenters, but are
j now the property of the church, and
: they have nothing to do but to let the
' matter take its own course."
All the members of the board and the
presenters agree in one paragraph of
the withdrawal paper, which read as
â¢ follows:
! "We earnestly desire that the long
existing scandal in the church shall be
I forever quieted."
DOUMOR ELECTED PRESIDENT
OF THE FRENCH CHAMBER
Has Actively Opposed a Number of
Measures Favored by Premier
Combes.
PARIS. Jan. 10.âBoth branches
of Parliament began their annual ses
sion to-day. There was great anima
tion in the Chamber of Deputies,
where the recent controversies rela
tive to the spying system and the ad
| ministration ofÂ» the navy led to a
movement for the election of Paul
; Doumor, former Governor G enera ' Â°*
' French Indo-China*. as President of
, the House against former President
! Henri Brisson. The contest was spir
r ited, resulting in the election of Dou
, mor by 265 votes to 240 cast for Bris
i son. The result was a surprise, as
Doumer heretofore had actively
posed a number of President Combes'
measures.
The President of the Senate, in his
i opening address, eulogized the heroism
iof the Russian soldiers.
I ROME. Jan. 10.âNews of the election
:of Doumor to the Presidency of the
: French Chamber of Deputies gives
great satisfaction at the Vatican,
where it is regarded as a notable de
feat for Premier Combes. Friends in
Paris of the Pontificate have been
pointing out for some time that "Dou
mor is one of the most fit among
French statesmen to succeed Premier
Combes, and it is reported that he has
been gathering about him the more
i moderate element in French politics.

Heroic Figure of Fred
erick the Great Unscathed
by a Mimic Explosion
Special Dispatch to The OUL
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. âA sensa
tion was caused In this city to-day
by the discovery of what appeared to
be a definite and serious attempt to
blow up or deface the statute of Fred
erick the Great, given to the United
States by Emperor William of Ger
many and erected in the arsenal
grounds near the Army College on the
Potomac River water front. In the
Southern part of the city. It waa be
lieved at first that a crank had made
a real effort at destruction of the
statue, but after a careful investiga
tion the police officials say the ma
terial used was incapable of producing
damage. All the evidence so far ob
tained, the police announced to-night,
tcr.ded to show that the attempted
effort to injure the statue waa puny
and amateurish to a degree. It Is re
garded as an atempt to work up a
sensation.
Detectives learned that a negro
hackman named Arthur Carter took
the man thought to have perpetrated
the affair from the Pennsylvania Rail
road to the statue. Apparently he had
just arrived in the city. His baggage
consisted of a small and worn dress
suit case. The man told the hackman
to drive slowly to the barracks
grounds. When the statue was
reached the stranger alighted, ran up
the sfHps leading to the westerly ter
race of the War College esplanade and
disappeared behind the pedestal of the
statue. A minute later he ran back
to the cab and the hackman noticed
that the grip which the stranger had
carried was missing. The man jumped
into the cab and ordered the hackman
to drive out of the grounds as quickly
as possible. Soon afblr getting out of
the grounds the stranger jumped out,
paid the hackman and disappeared
tcward the river front.
Post Baker Reiger. at the barracks,
saw the cab drive up and the man
jump out and run toward the statue
with a satchel under his arm, from
which smoke was issuing, but he
could not see what became of the
man.
The man had hung the suit case by
a wire hook to the iron fence sur
rounding the statue. A few minutes
later a negro discovered it and dis
lodged it from the fence with a piece
of scantling. As it fell to the ground
it exploded. Aside from throwing a
few splotches of mud upon the steps
of the pedestal no harm was done.
One effect of the explosion was the
hurried building of a small watch box
beside the statue, where a watchman
will be stationed all the time here
after.

OAKLAND had a clear sheet on which to write a municipal
water policy that would protect her people against bad ad- j
ministration, and insure a thoroughly business-like policy in |
acquiring and running a municipal plant. There has been progress
in the world in these matters, and there is an accumulation of ex
perience for the guidance of the future. It is settled in this country
and in Europe that no private plant should be left in the field to
compete with a public plant, and ttiat the cost of the public plant
should rest upon it alone, leaving the public credit free. It is also
settled that the organization of the municipal government should
have the official machinery required in the creation and operation
of a public plant, and that this official machinery should be per
manent, resting upon merit, and not subject to the political changes
of personnel, which are inevitable in a government resting on suf
frage. Our sister city seems to have turned her back on each of
these settled principles and, as might have been expected under such
circumstances, favors a proposition that is open to all of the objec
tions that may be brought against municipal ownership and to
others, more serious, that inhere in the specific plan adopted.
We regret that this noted California city has refused to make a
ikw datum line, from which all future experiments in municipal
trading would be measured. With such an opportunity to prove that
a municipal plant can be bought on its own credit and successfully
run and paid for out of its own revenues, leaving the public credit
free for use in the desirable public improvements which press upon
all modern cities, it is regrettable that Oakland should prefer to imi
tate the worst policies of the past, rather than take the honor of
originating the better policy of the future.
It will be noticed that a refusal to make a municipal water plant
carry its own bonds and its own cost of administration is a signifi
cant admission that municipal ownership is a failure. The propo
nents of that policy should 4>e glad of the chance to prove that its
administration can be as economical and as business-like as that of
a private plant. When they have the chance to prove this, and
refuse it, they cannot complain if the opponents of municipal social
ism take advantage of their refusal.
In the Oakland proposition are certain singular features that
may be examined independently of any views for or against munici
paf ownership. With the power to condemn the existing plant and
so eliminate its competition, it is proposed to bond the city for a
plant that is not yet in existence, and whose rights to any water
arc in litigation, and the city is denied the right to make any con
tract for that plant until after its hands are tied by voting the bonds.
That is to say, the people are asked to vote bonds, tie their hands,,
mortgage the public credit, leave a competitor in the field, without
having any contract for anything. As the plant for which the bonds
are to be voted was condemned by the only expert who has exam
ined it. and as the bonds are to be pledged in advance of any con
tract for the delivery of any specified quantity of water, and as the
Belters propose to use wood pipe instead of iron, the project seems to
be in discord to all business principles.
If our interest in such public questions and our friendly interest
in our neighboring city qualify us to advise, we would surely advise
the people of Oakland to insist upon a complete contract before they
vote on bonds, and to vote down all bonds until they have a con
tract and know for what they are voting. The expenditure of ap
proximately $6,000,000 without any contract would revolt any busi
ness man. No individual, firm or corporation would think of doing
such an unbusiness-like thing; then why should a city tamper with
the public credit to do it? We have seen no reason given either by
members of the city government or the sellers of the proposed plant
for refusing to make a contract before voting bonds.
The spirit if not the letter of the law for such bond issues is that
the people in voting on bonds vote to ratify or reject a contract. In
Oakland they are asked to vote millions to a project for which there
is no contract. We regard such a vote as void in law. Of course
the implication is that the proposed contract has features which the
people would not indorse, therefore these must be concealed. All
proper policy and all fair dealing require that the people shall have
the contract before them, to ratify or reject as they see fit. Instead
of this the people are asked to mortgage their property for millions
to carry out a contract which they are not permitted to see. Such
a proposition has in it the elements of all kinds of loss, scandal and
trouble, and it should be stopped now by making a contract and
letting the people see it and vote upon it.
If we cannot have the satisfaction of seeing a right start made
by basing the bonds on the plant they create, we can have the satis
faction of advising that at least the people, who are to pay the bill,
be permitted to see the contract on which they are voting.
A CORRESPONDENT finds analogy between retirement at
â  the age limit of 62 in the army and navy, and the retirement
of United States Senators at the same age. There is no anal
ogy. The age limit in the army and navy is not based upon the su
perannuation of officers, but is for the purpose of permitting the line
to move up by promotion. At 62 a man may be in his mental and
physical prime, indeed most men are. General Miles is as well qual
ified to lead an army as he was twenty years ago, and Terry, the
last rear admiral retired in the navy, would resent the insinuation
that he is not as good a man as ever. 4
In public life outside the army and navy we have abundant evi
dence of the great usefulness of men who are long past 62. Of the
Senators Morgan is 81, and his colleague is 84, and they both do
full duty. Of others past the age of 62 are Berry, Perkins, Bard,
Teller, Patterson, Piatt of Connecticut and Piatt of New York, Haw
ley, Bacon, Cullom, Allison, Blackburn, McCreery, McEnery, Hale,
Frye, Gorman, Burrows, Alger, Nelson, Money, Cockrell, Clark of
Montana, Gibson, Millard, Stewart, Gallinger, Dryden, DepeW,
Mitchell, Aldrich, Bate, Proctor, Dillingham, Daniel, Foster, Elkins,
Scott, Spooner and Quarles. So it appears that near half the Sena
tors are over the age at which our correspondent would retire them.
Allison, Cockrell, Morgan and the late Senator Hoar, the oldest
of all. were among the most useful men in either house of Congress.
To empty the Senate of these men on account of age would be to
deprive it of much of its best working material and the most useful
to the country. The saying "old men for counsel, young- men for
war," is justified by the world's experience, though it is not a denial
that young men may be also qualified for counsel, as we know they
are. But old men are not disqualified. We think it is wise that the
constitution fixes a minimum age for the Senate of 30 years and
for the House of 25, but omits a maximum entirely.

CONTUSION
AND CANDY
GEORGIAN GRISWOLD
JIMMIE DUDLEY gased blankly
at the letter before him. It was
the first time that any trouble
had arisen between him and
Mabel, and he could not quite
grasp it.
j "You needn't come up this even-
I ing," the letter ran, "I don't want
ever to see you again. I supposed
that you were manly and honest and
true. I never supposed you were de
ceiving another girl just as you have

and Jim Tucker, feelingly.

been deceiving me. I shall keep the
candy and the letter, too. I suppose
ehe has the candy intended for me,
and you can easily write another let
ter. You seem to be quite apt at
writing letters."
There was no signature, though it
needed no name to tell Jimmie from
whom the letter came. There was
only Â©ne girl to whom he sent candy
and wrote letters, and he had been
anticipating such a pleasant evening
with her.
All that morning the letters on the
Sheets before him,engaged in a car
itlval dance. By noon he was an
hour behind in his work, and when
the chief clerk asked him if he had
sent that Thompson letter, referring
to a matter under office discussion,
he decided that Jimmie had been
drinking, for the poor fellow an
swered that he had sent it, but that
he did not know what in the world
was the matter.
For Jirnmie there was only one
letter, and that had gone the day be
fore to Mabel Stanley, enclosed in a
box of chocolates. He always sent
Mabel chocolates on Wednesdays and
Saturdays, and a letter was always
enclosed. He could not understand
why the letter should have made her
so angry. It had only contained a
few tender messages, and the an
nouncement that he would be up
Thursday evening as usual. He had
hoped on this very evening to ask
her the question that had been trem
bling upon his lips ever since he had
been given that last raise in salary.

New he was forbidden to come, and
he did not even know why!
Some how he blundered along until
lunch time, and when that relief came
he wandered along the street trying
to puzale out the mystery. So en
grossed had he become in his thoughts
that he was then minutes late in get
ting back to the office.
"What do you mean by writing a
letter like that?" Tucker shouted as
ho nourished a paper under the as
tonished Dudley's nose.
"Where did you see Mabel?" de
manded the under man.
"Mabel!" yelled the irate Tucker.
"What have I to do with Mabel?"
"Nothing. I hope," said Jimmie
Dudley fervently, "but you seem to ,
have taken the-matter up."
"Taken it up!" repeated Tucker, j
"Why shouldn't I take It up when it
may cost me the sweetest girl In all j
the world?"
"I thought you were engaged to !
Belle Winchell," spluttered Dudley,
who was beginning to find the pres- ,
sure upon his throat decidedly Incon
venient.
"I was," hissed Tucker, tightening â 
his grip upon his victim's throat, "un- |
til you, with your asslnine Ideas of i
comedy broke it off."
"Then what about Mabel?" gasped
Jimmie.
"That," said Tucker, releasing his
hold and spreading the paper before
Jimmies eyes.
"Why shouldn't I write like that to !
Mabel?" demanded Dudley, as his eye
fell upon his own handwriting. j
"Why should you send it to Belle?" i
counter-questioned Tucker.
Jimmies glance fell upon Dave
Bowen, who had entered. Dave was
doubled up with laughter. Light
dawned upon Jimmies understanding.
"Did you send Belle some candy yes
terday?" he asked Tucker eagerly.
"As though you didn't know,"
sneered Tucker. "Didn't you put this
note in?"
"Did you get it at Croft's?" pursued
Jimmie.
"Didn't you see the name on the
box?" asked Tucker.
"Pound box?" continued Jimmie.
"You know it was," said Tucker.
With a howl Jimmie precipitated
himÃelf upon Bowen and, taking him
ofl his guard, promptly tripped him up
and sat upon his chest.
"Did you get a letter accusing you
of writing love letters to two girls?" ;
demanded Dudley of Tucker.
"She said I was trying to disguise
my handwritingâas if I ever would
write as badly as you do."
"DayÂ«. di<l Â«"Â»Â« mix those boxes?" |
demar.dad Dudley.
1 cay... ' aamiued Dave inelegantly, j
"You see, the two boxes were just '
alike and I knew that each held a
letter. It was easy to mix things up."
"You did," said Jim Dudley and
Jim Tucker feelingly, and Tucker
added his weight to Dudley's. ,
They stopped Just short of murder
and then made Dave write elaborate
explanations to both Mabel and Belle
detailing how he had seen that there
were twin boxes of candy on the two
desks and how he had changed them.
He was let off only after it was
found that the explanations were ac
cepted, but Dave declares that if he
ever falls in love he is going to change
his position to avoid misunderstand- ;
inga. And Dudley and Tucker assure
him feelingly that it would be the
wiser course.

WANTS TO AID
THE PLANTERS
Washington Official Says
University Needs Improved
College of Agriculture
A semi-official letter bearing upon
the establishing of an agricultural col
lege at the University of California waa
received several days ago by Judge P.
J. Shields of Sacramento, and forward
ed by him to this city. It was yester
day read at a meeting of the State
Board of Regents.
The letter came from Dr. A. C. True,
director of the Office of Experiment
Stations, Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D. O, and was ah embodi
ment of his views on the establishment
of an agricultural college, the necessary
preparations to insure the endowment
of same by the Government, and the
practical good that would result to
California from such a step.
Dr. True told of the interest the de
partment -vas taking in agricultural
education at the California University
and outlined the Intentions of the Gov
ernment toward procuring a farm for
the College of Agriculture. This farm,
he maintained, should be in prox
imity to Berkeley, so as to avoid mak
ing it a separate institution. The course
should be broad-gauged and include
special studies in all branches of
farming.
In the meantime, Dr. True adds, Cal
ifornia must strengthen her agricultur
al work so as to be in a position to
conduct good college courses and turn
out the best class of students. The pres
ent agricultural building, he adds, is
wholly unsatisfactory. It lacks lecture
rooms, laboratories and equipment for
instruction. Some of the most impor
tant departments art quartered in the
attics, and some in the stables.
Dr. True then goes on to compare
the present agricultural quarters with
those of other branches and says that
poor accommodations keep students out
of the classes.
President Wheeler of the university
is in receipt of a letter from Professor
Campbell of the Lick Observatory, stat
ing that he had received $3000 from the
Carnegie Institute of Washington, to
be expended during the next two years
in measuring and reducing the Cross
ley reflector photograph plates of the
minor planet, Eros. The plates are of
the highest value in aiding to deter
mine the distance between the earth

BIG BUSINESS
DEAL EFFECTED
Family Difficulties Cause De
la Montanya & Co. to
Part With Their Concern
The domestic difficulties of the De la
Montanyas have culminated in the re
tirement from business of their great
hardware concern. The doors of their
establishment at 214 Jackson street
were closed to the trade forever j*ea
terday noon. The property has been
purchased by the Pacific Hardware
and Steel Company for a sura approxi
mating half a million dollars. The big
deal was effected yesterday morning
after five days of preliminary negotia
tions. The -formal transfer of the stock
will take place at an early date and
all visible assets will be removed to
the gigantic new plant of the purchas
ing concern at Seventh and Townsend
streets.
Last Friday a representative of J. de
la Montanya A Co. visited H. J. Mor
ton of the Pacific Hardware and Steel
Company and offered to sell the Jack
son street establishment at any reason
able price.
The directors of the larger concern
took the matter under consideration,
looked over the property of the Mon
tanya firm, and then offered a ball
million dollars for the business, con
tingent upon the amount of stock is
hand. The offer was immediately ac
cepted, for the Montanyas earnestly
desire to retire from the local hardware
field.
The Jackson street concern has bees
in business for more than a quarter ol
a century. It was reckoned one of Ban
Francisco's strongest wholesale houses.
The Montanya family harmony has
been frequently shocked of late, how
ever, and the members of company de
cided that it would be for the interesti
of all the stockholders to give up the
battle in the business world. Morton
of the Pacific Hardware and Steel
Company says the Montanyas bad a
splendid business, much better than
he had supposed, in fact. Their trade
in stoves he said furnished a particu
larly agreeable surprise.
Sneak Thieves at Work.
N. Abe, proprietor of a Japanese
store at 686 Sutter street, reported to
the police yesterday that during thÂ«
night a showcase in front of his store
bad been broken/open and silk ki
monas, a pair or white satin corset;
and other articles of the value of $84
stolen. 1m Well, proprietor of a cigar,

ported that a Jar containing chewing
gum had been stolen from bis counter

WILL SUPPORT
YOSEMITE BILL
oard of Trade Passes Reso
lutions Indorsing Federal
Ownership of the Park
STATESMEN TO LEND AID
Belshaw and Estudillo Are
Ready to Present Measure
in Senate and Assembly
The members of the State Board of
Trade held a session yesterday after
noon and quickly disposed of the Yo
semite Valley bill among other things.
When the report of the committee ap
pointed to investigate the matter was
read a motion was* made for its adop
tion and it was carried unanimously.
This means that the board will do all
in its power to turn the Yosemite Val
ley over to the Federal Government
and divorce it entirely from State in
fluence.
Some time ago a committee com
posed of William H. Mills, C. M.
Wooster, S. F. Booth and Arthur P.
Briggs was appointed by the board to
make a report on the proposed bill.
The quartet worked earnestly on the
subject and received the support of
several prominent organizations in va
rious parts of the State, including the
Sierra Club, which has taken an active
interest in the flght for a long time.
The committee reported that Sen
ator C. M. Belshaw and Assemblyman
Miguel Estudillo of Riverside had vol
unteered to make a vigorous cam
paign In'both houses for the passage
of the bill. These two statesmen
some time ago came to the rescue of
the Sierra Club and promised to aid
that body to have the bill put
through.
Comments on the measure were
made by Chairman Briggs, Colonel
Irish, William H. Mills and C. M.
Wooster. They all agreed that the
fight for the passage of the bill will
be a bitter one and that the opposing
faction is leaving nothing undone to
retain the property for the State.
A copy of the report by the com
mittee, together with a copy of the
bill and other data pertaining to the
Yosemite, was read and approved and
Secretary Briggs was ordered to have
a copy sent to the Legislature and
Senate at once. It is expected that the
bill will come up for a hearing in a
short time and the board ts sanguine
of success in winning its.flght.
A. W. Van der Naillen sent a com
munication to the board informing it
of the proposed exhibition to be held
at Leeds, Belgium, and requesting
that the body make an effort to rep
resent California products there. Af
ter a lengthy discussion it was agreed
to support the measure provided the
fruit growers raise sufficient funds to
carry the matter through.
A telegram from Senator Perkins,
telling of his work In aid of the Oak
land harbor, was read. Perkins is at
present trying to pass a bill providing
for an appropriation to better the har
bor across the bay. The Water and
Forest Association requested the
board to lend its aid in securing an
appropriation for certain surveys. The
board refused to act in this matter.
Manitoba Tourists.
A carload of 30 tourists arrived in the
city yesterday direct from Winnipeg.
Manitoba, via the Northern Pacific and
Southern Pacific, en route to Southern
California for the Winter.
Yesterday was spent in sight-seeing
around San Francisco and the party left
for the South last evening.
They are to be followed by a second
party which the Northern Pacific Com
pany has scheduled to reach here the
28th inst.
TRIAL OF TAYLOR WILL
CONTEST IS UNDER WAY
Half-Sister, Who Was Not Remem
bered, Seeks to Set Aside
Old Man's Testament.
A beginning was made in Judge
Troutt's court yesterday in the trial
of the contest of the will of the late
James D. Taylor, but because the lead
ing witness was without her glasses
and could not identify certain docu
ments an adjournment was taken until
this morning. The witness was Mrs.
Ella H. Tajbott, in whose house Taylor
died and who witnessed the will. She
is charged by Taylor's half-sister, Llz
sie Taylor McÃride, with having un
duly influenced the old man in the
making of his last testament, which
was drawn three days before hft died
in April of last year. The contestant
alleges that Taylor was suffering from
Injuries received in an accident and
was not of sound mind. Mrs. Talbott,
sh<Â» declares, asked him to make a will
and herself had it prepared, getting
the names of his relatives by examin
ing letters he had received from them.
In this process the sister was omit
ted and the $20,000 estate was left in
equal shares to a brother, nephew and
n'ece in Wisconsin and a niece, Bee
Taylor, In Washington, D. C, with
$[.00 added in a codicil for a nephew
in Missouri.
Bee Taylor achieved some notoristy
some time ago by losing a Government
position at Washington because she
criticised the President's Filipino
policy.

MOTHER'S COUSIN WANTS
TO GUARD BABY SMITH
Third Application for Custody of In
fant Heir Filed in Court by
Robert Peterson.
A third applicant for the guardtan
ship of two-year-old Randolph Wil
son Smith, son of the late Butler
Smith, appeared yesterday in Robert
Peterson, who says that he is a cousin
of the child's deceased mother, Ella
Roberta Smith. Peterson also asks
for the guardianship of the boy's sis- j
ter, Roberta. The second Mrs. Smith
left a fortune of $100,000 in trust for j
her children, in which the father had
a life interest. The third wife, Emily |
May Smith, who married the real es- j
tate dealer a month before his death,
now has the children and has applied
for their legal custody. Another ap- j
plication for guardianship of the boy
was made by Mrs. M. Findlay, his
nurse.
Peterson, in his petition, sets forth
the situation regarding the fortune
and says that the stepmother's inter
ests are in conflict with those of the
children and therefore she is not the
proper person to be their guardian.
He says that he and his brother and
sister are their only blood relatives.
The sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Willis, lives
at Napa.
The applications of Mrs. Smith and
Mrs. Findlay were to have been heard
yesterday, but were continued until
Friday.

Special Dispatch to Tb< Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 10. âThe Pa
cific Const Field Trials Derby is still
unfinished, but a winner will be de
clared to-morrow before noon. A
start will then be made In all-age
stakes. The young dogs showed great
form to-day and the veterans in at
tendance say they never saw so many
high class animals started in one
stake.. Ideal conditions prevail for
The development of good work, as
birds are plentiful and the weather is
.cool, with light winds.
The sportsmen here are enthusiastic
over the work shown by the setters
and pointers. Their ranks were
largely increased to-day. The morn-
Jug's trains brought men from bothi
the north and south. There is a fine
spirit of sportsmanship shown in the
field, no sign of jealousy nor of com
mercialism being in evidence. No
one seems to give a thought to the
prizes, while all join in praising any
clever work shown by a dog.
The first brace of dogs put down
in the morning were W. W. Van
Arsdale's black, white and tan Eng
lish setter Mariposa, handled by C. H.
Babcock, and J. E. Terry's black,
white and tan English setter Ken
wood, handled by Fred Coutts. They
proved a brace of fast, wide ranging,
merry working dogs, with Mariposa
slightly the better in all these
teristics.
MARIPOSA IN GOOD FORM.
After several wide casts had been
made Mariposa dropped to a point in
high weeds, where conditions seemed
unfavorable. In these weeds each dog
secured two points. Mariposa was at
once marked by the knowing ones
as sure to go in the second series. The
next brace down was Rose and
tensen's black, white and tan Eng
lish setter Del Rey Belle, handled by
Charles Coutts, and M. Lawrence's
lemon and white English setter
Youley, handled by S. M. Carlisle.
This brace was in good cover, where
there were plenty of birds, and they
scored' a number of points. Youley
was somewhat deficient In style.
After these came Fargo Rose's
orange and white setter Rival, handled
by W. B. Coutts, and W. B. Coutts*
liver and white pointer Bolins Duke,
handled by Charles Coutts. These had
a long run, which was not productive
of much point work. While both
at times showed fairly good speed and
made some clever casts, they were un
certain in their work.
J. B. Terry's lemon and white Eng
lish setter Ladylike, handled by W. B.
Coutts, and A. Cadigan's liver and
white pointer dog Chiquite, handled by
J. E. Lucas, were the next brace down,
and they gave the spectators a clever
exhibition of speed, wide casting and
clever point work, Ladylike scoring 6
points to the dog's 4. From the char
acter of the ground over which they
worked and the high class of both
dogs possibly no heat in the race. up
to this time was better appreciated by
the assembled sportsmen.
. Mountain View Kennels' liver and
white pointer Sandango, handled by J.
E. Lucas, was cast off to run his bye
on the same ground when the last
brace was taken up. Soon after he
was put In action, in attempting to go
through a wire fence, he injured his
fore leg, which lamed him so serious
ly as to destroy any chance he might
have had for the stake.
COMPETITION IS CLOSE.
The officials and spectators f*hen
moved to a new field, about a mile dis
tant, where Judge Betten announced
that the following dogs would take
part in the second series: Nellie P
with Sir Roderick, Ladylike with Mari
posa, Del Rey Belle with Eurbank
and Chirjuite with Japan. The first
brace of the second series was Nellie
P and Sir Roderick. Both dogs went
away at a clipping gait, Sir Roderick
making one cast into the timber which
kept him out of sight so long as would

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 10.
In the December number of the Stan
ford Alumnus Archie Rice, Stanford
'93, who has been a close follower of
Western football for the last ten years,
has picked an "All-Pacific Coast elev
en." Stanford is given seven places on
the team, California three, and Nevada
one.
The personnel of the all-star aggre
gation is as follows: Left end, Clark
(170), Stanford; left tackle, Sprott (178),
Stanford; left guard, Thompson (190),
Stanford; center, Stroud (195), Califor
nia; right guard, Roosevelt (190), Stan
ford; left tackle, Heitmuller (185), Cali
fornia; left end, Snediger (173), Califor
nia; quarterback, Stott (150), Stanford;
left half, Chalmers (175), Stanford;
right half, Weiler (195), Stanford; full
back, Freisell (175), Nevada.
The only surprises on the team is the
placing of Snedigar at end and Freisell
at fullback. Rice says the latter has
no peer at the position, placing him
ahead cf Weller of Stanford, who is
shifted to halfback.
Rice praises the w r ork of this year's
Stanford eleven, declaring it the best
team the Cardinal has yet turned out.

have appeared a bolt had he not on
the previous day made several casts
of the same character to his handler.
A number of points were secured In
the latter part of the-heat, a majority
of which were to Sir Roderick's credit.
The work of both dogs was good, but
the heat resulted in the latter's favor.
The next and last brace of the day
was Mariposa and Ladylike. This
proved another great exhibition of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, JANUARY It, 1905.
TRAVERS PILOTS VENATOR
THROUGH IN THE HANDICAP
Martinmas, Favorite
in Betting, Takes
the; Place. .
Public Choices All
Meet Defeat at
Oakland.
BY FRED E. MUEHOLLAND.
A heavy fog the night before and
the peek-a-boo tactics of the sun found
the track at Oakland yesterday still in
a very muddy condition.
It .'aught the form students up in the
air, and as six favorites failed to toe
thf scratch it can easily be surmised
that the bookmakers carried off the
swap. Prickles, Melar. Barney Drey
fuss and Stilicho furnished the sur
prises. Fine weather attracted a large
crowd.
While Venator, with 112 pounds,
]"<>kpd to have a royal chance of cap
turing the six and a half furlong handi
cap, the bookies insisted on installing
Martinmas a pronounced favorite. The
Henshall entry was also asked to jug
gle 112 pounds, which he failed to do.
Travers soon had Venator in front af
ter the start and Dr. Rowell's sprinter
won easily, without ever being headed
or extended. The favorite experienced
no difficulty in subduing the feather
weight. Sea Voyage, securing place
honors.
OUTSIDER ROMPS IX FIRST.
Walter Jennings" filly, Princess
W'heeier, does not find the path lead
ing from the maiden class strewn with
roses. Ridden by Jakie Jones, she had
a decided call in the betting on the
opening event, and finished second.
Prickles, an S to 1 chance, with Bonner
up, made a runaway race of it, winning
without effort.* Macene, one of the
Ezell entries, ran a close third. ,
There looked to be only one chance
of downing Del Carina, the 7 to 10 favor
ite for the sprint following, and that
was to have the filly left at the pOst.
Sam Greenfield did not get her left,
but he rode a race that would do credit
to a bronco buster, and was defeated
by Melar, a 9 to 1 chance, piloted by-
Tommy Clark. Fay Templeton was
third. Entre Nous, the second choice,
ran out in front to the stretch, then
faded away.
BERENDOS BADLY BEATEN.
Some few of the layers chalked up
5 to 1 against Lady Kent when betting
began on the six-furlong selling run.
but not many pasteboards were passed
out at that quotation. At that, the
mare closed an 18 to 5 second choice
and, ridden by Greenfield, won in hol
low fashion from Dr. Sherman. Albe
marle secured the show. Helgesen got
away poorly with Berendos.Mhe favor
ite, and was never a contender.
"Pacing Dick" De Neffe, who Is aa
liable to turn up in Indian Territory
as he is at a White House dinner, finally
put one over. His Dorian gelding, Bar
ney Dreyfuss, dropped from the clouds
in the mile selling Axture.leading Major
Tenny over the line nearly a length.
Isabellita, the 11 to 5 choice, ran a fair
third. The winner went to the post at
odds of 6 to L
Brinkworth & Co.'s Little Wally
bumped up against it again in the clos
ing mile and three-sixteenth selling
event. Byronerdale, the 17 to 10 favor
ite, ran an exceedingly poor race, but
Stllicho, a 6 to 1 chance, displayed ex
ceptional speed, beating Little Wally
very cleverly by nearly a length. Modi
cum, a well touted and played starter,
finished third.
TRACK NOTES.
The card at Oakland this afternoon
is far above the average. Sir Wilfred
and Daruma meet again in the two
ytar-old event, and in the last race of
the day Sad Sam, The Lady Rohesia,
W. R. Condon and other fast ones
come together.
Sam Greenfield piloted two winners.
Both Tommy Clark and O. Chandler
are riding well. Chandler has improved
greatly over his Portland and Seattle
form.
George Berry, superintendent of
Napa Stock Farm, was a visitor at the
track yesterday. George is carrying a
handsome gold split second chronome
ter presented to him by A. B. Spreckels,
proprietor of the big Napa breeding es
tablishment, as a memento of the win
of Daruma, first of the get of Imp.
Solitaire to sport the colors.
Elrodun, the property of Lagoria &
Forbes, was sold In the paddock before
the first race to A. Libenthal for $850.
At a meeting held yesterday by the
directors of the California Jockey Club,
the incumbent officials were re-elected
for the ensuing year.
The stewards of the Pacific Jockey
Club, the governing turf body of the
coast, also met yesterday. The dates
recently claimed by the Seattle and
Portland associations were ratified, as
were the licenses issued by the Los
Angeles Jockey Club. Harry Stover,
owner of Kenilworth Park, Petaluma,
asked for 28 days, but was given only
12, to follow after the close of Oak
land on May 6.
The Knapp case was also taken up by
the stewards, but no decision rendered.
A copy of the contract purported to be
held on the services of "Big Bill"
Knapp by Puerl Wilkerson was shown.
The original contract it was claimed
by Wilkerson is now on the way here
by mail from New York, and until it is
produced nothing further will be done
In the matter.
It is said Green Morris, who is racing
a strlns of horses at Ascot Park, re
cently refused an offer of $10,000 for
Gold Rose, the crack three-year-old Al
ly.
To date races have been divided
among the winning horses at Oakland
as follows: %
Winner of 1 race 98
Winners of 2 races 49
Winners of 3 races 24
Winners of 4 races 3

CORRIGAN MAY BE BARRED
FROM SEVERAL RACE TRACKS
Fails to Make List of Entries and
Trouble Is Brewing at
Memphis.
MEMPHIS, Term., Jan. 10.âBe
cause Edward Corrigan failed to make
his usual list of entries to the Mem
phis Jockey Club stakes, which re
cently closed on account of his actibn
in declaring all colts and fillies out of
the local Derby and Oaks, horsemen
here say that he will be seen compet
ing at few tracks this year under
jurisdiction of the Western Jockey
Club. A rumor that the local jockey
club has practically sounded open
war to be waged against Corrigan in
behalf of the Western Jockey Club by
refusing to accept entries would not
be discussed by the members of the
Memphis Jockey Club or its officials.
CORBETT SIGNS
TO BOX NELSON
Denver Lad and the Great
Bane Will Meet in Re
turn Battle Next Month
The long expected return match be
tween Young Corbett and Battling
Nelson was framed up last- night. Mor
ris Levy, manager of the Hayes Val
ley Athletic Club, announced that the
boys had signed to box twenty rounds
under the auspices of his organiza
tion in February at 130 pounds at 6
o'clock, the same weight at which they
battled before.
The match has been under considera
tion for a long time past and it was
no secret that Levy had planned to
bring the lads together in a return
bout. Corbett has been crying for a
chance to redeem himself ever since
the night that the Battling Dane beat
him to a pulp and now that the op
portunity has been given him, his
friends say he will go to work and
get ready for the meeting.
The minor details of the match have
not as yet been settled. It is likely
that some discussion will occur when
the referee question is about to be ad
justed. Nelson says he will have no
more of Roche, though he had no
cause for complaint, as the Bowery
Boy acted right when the Dane was
beaten by Britt.
Corbett likes Roche good enough to
let him judge any of his fights and
will surely propose his name. He is
also friendly with Eddie Graney again
and when their little quarrel was
patched up the Denver boy stated that
Graney was the man he would hold
out for the next time he was due to
battle with someone.
. Nelson is at present away In the
woods on an extended hunting trip
and will not return for a couple of
weeks at least. His tramps through
the mountains will keep him in good
form and a fortnight of training in
the evm will be all he needs to make
him fit and ready, as the weight is
easy for the champion of Hedgwich.
Corbett is working at Shannon's, San
Rafael, and says he is getting into
shape. He had said this so often that
the public does not always take It
with the best of grace. This time

BIG WRESTLER
BEATS CARKEEK
The Veteran Cannot Eesist
Strength of Tom Jenkins,
Who Has Youth in Favor
CELEBRITIES PRESENT
Crowd Listens to Prize Fight
ers, Bull Fighters and
T. McGrath's Noisy Vest
By sheer strength Tom Jenkins, the
champion all-round wrestler, forced
Jack Carkeek, the veteran of catch-as
catch-can, to the mat twice last night
at Woodward's Pavilion. It was Father
Time who helped get the victory for
the big fellow. The elder man showed
that he had all the tricks of the game
by heart, but he could not work his
holds en Jenkins.
The veteran went down fighting on
each fall. Every muscle on the frame
that was not as supple as It used to
be strained to the utmost in futile re
sistance as the Cleveland giant forced
his shoulders to the mat.
The first fall was won in 17 minutes
and 30 seconds. Carkeek was thrown,
but cleverly stalled all attempts of Jen
kins to get a good hold. Juat when it
looked like curtains for the veteran he
suddenly slipped away and put the big
fellow on the defensive, but not for
long. Jenkins secured a half Nelson and
bar wrist hold on the veteran. One of
Carkeek's shoulders touched the mat.
Jenkins threw into the hold all his
enormous strength. Slowly the other
shoulder of the veteran was forced
down. Carkeek struggled gamely, but
youth told. The other shoulder touched
the mat. Referee Eugene Van Court
tapped the big fellow in the back. First
fall for Jenkins.
The second fall resulted after some
lively work. Carkeek caught the big
fellow napping and had him guessing
for a few minutes. The veteran se
cured good holds twice. If he had the
ginger of other days, Jenkins would
still be wondering how it happened. But
Jenkins escaped the slaughter and got
a three-tiuarter Nelson. Suddenly he
shifted to a half Nelson and an arm
hold. Jenkins fhrew forward all hlÂ»
weight and Carkeek was out. Time, 4
minutes and 45 seconds.
A preliminary bout between Al Brill
and George Braun went to Braun.
George Harding refereed this match.
Though Brill was heavier, Braun han
dled him easily, taking the first fall in
8 minutes and the second In 5 minutes
and 36 seconds.
All the celebrities were there. Billy
Jordan got a compound fracture of the
voice trying to introduce them. Young
Corbett was the first to be called before
the calcium vest of Tim McGrath. The
little fellow was welcomed like a long
lost brother.
Then entered J. Edward Britt, boy
orator of the ring. "I am ready to
fight any man in the world at 133 ring
side," announced "Chames."
Like a shot Young Corbett leaped
back into the ring, "I'll fight Britt at
that weight any time with a side bet
of $5000, winner to take all," he an
nounced.
With the hauteur of pate de foie
gras in his demeanor J. Edward strode
back: "Ladies and gentlemen," he
announced, "I have defeated Mr. Cor
bett once. I do not think I should
fight him again until I have tried all
the new material. I can announce
that Uaere will be one more fight be
twesjHfeSngland and America. I am
negotiations to fight Mr. Ja
bez Wnlte of England."
Mistah Jonsing also presented
to the clamoring multitude temporari
ly eclipsing the splendor of Tim Mc-
Grath's vest. Kid McCoy, accom
panied by a swagger cane, was an
nounced as the "Beau Brummel of the
prize ring." Frankie Neil and Dick
Hyland, who are to mix soon, also
made their little bows.
The sensation among the introduc
tions was Senor Henrico Robles of
Madrid, Spanish bullfighter by occu
pation. "I no speaka the Engleep,"
announced the Don. "But I flght-a da
bull. I wrestle any bull in America
for 500 pesos. Take him by the horn
and throw him. Fine and dandy, you
call him, what?" and the toreador
from Spain smiled a smile that was
all good nature. The bullfighter was
in tow of Young Corbett and company.
Spider Kelly, the cotillion kid, and
T. McGrath Esp., assisted by a vest,
second Jenkins. Mr. McGrath an
nounced that the poem of haberdash
ery was worn in compliment to the
ladies present. The presence of the
fair sex caused Billy Jordan to ad
monish the gentlemen present to use
parlor language and to say, "Oh,
mercy!" or "Gracious," if excitement
overcame them. The admonition was
heeded.
Butchers' Board of Trade.
At the last meeting of the Butchers'
Board of Trade the following officers

WILL BE REPAIRED AT THIS PORT.
.vrâ
The contract for repairing Uncle
Sam's big dredger Chinook, formerly
the army transport Grant, was award
ed'yesterday to the Risdon Iron Works
of this city. The Chinook is now at
T'acoma, and every engineering firm of
â¢consequence on the coast was after the
â¢work. The repairs to be made are ex
t'ensjive, and the Risdon's bid of $21,310
â¢ was, the lowest.
' The Chinook is equipped with much
complicated machinery. In converting
her to. a dredger the latest theories of
-construction were put into practice. To
; a - certain extent the Chinook was a
success, but in the practical work not
ât*. few of the ideas which had governed
.her- construction were knocked on the
'licad. Some of the mistakes made in
\he original plans were responsible, it
â¢is'said, for the extensive repairs now
necessary. The wear and tear on the
machinery during the time sha was in
â¢commission are said to have been out
;of all proportion to the work the
â¢Chinook did. When the repairs are ef
fected it is expected that the Chinook
â¢â¢#â¢111 be an invaluable aid in making
[navigable waters now too shoal for
â¢ safety In anything but fine weather.
' Following were the bids for repair
ing and overhauling the Chinook: Ris
.'don Iron Works, $21,310; Union Iron
â¢Works.' $22,252; Puget Sound Iron
.Works. Seattle, $22,333; Willamette Iron
Work's, Portland. $26,349; Heffernan
Iron Works, Seattle, $26,653; Columbia
Works, Portland, $39,620.
â¢The Chinook is expected here in
.a,bout a week.

SAILORS STRIKE
DURING A GALE
Refuse to Save the Lakme!
Unless Guaranteed More
Pay From Vessel's Owners
CREW MUTINIES ON BAR
'Captain Carlson Forced to
Use Much Diplomacy in!
Order to Rescue His Ship
A strike of sailors when the vessel on
which they were employed was in im
minent danger of destruction was a
novel phase of the labor question
brought to light yesterday during the
investigation into the disabling of the
steam schooner Lakme. On January
1, shortly after 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, as the Lakme was crossing Hum
boldt bar, she struck the south spit
of black spar buoy No. 1, losing her
rudder and disabling her engines. The
vessel listed heavily and lost a portion
of her deck load by the heavy seas that
dashed over her, causing her stout tim
bers to quiver as though she were
about to go to pieces. At this junc
ture Captain John VV. Carlson, master
of the Lakme, ordered the crew to
jettison some of the remaining deck
load in order to right the vessel. To
his astonishment and indignation the
sailors went on strike. They refused
to lift a hand unless the captain would
agree to pay them overtime. Captain
Carlson, by the exercise of diplomacy
and cajolery, succeeded in inducing
them to save the vessel and to end the
strike.
The captain told Unifed States Local
Inspectors Bolles and Bulger that all
the crew were foreigners and that there
was not an American among them.
The situation becoming very critical,
the crew were transferred to the tug
Ranger, which attempted to tow the
disabled Lakme into port, but the haw
ser parted. Captain Carlson ordered
the crew to go off in the small boats,
recover the hawser and make fast.
They mutinied again and refused to
perform this duty. Finally, with the
assistance of the Ranger and the
steamer North Fork, the Lakme was.
towed into this port badly damaged.

The Norwegian Singing Society of >
, Bar. Francisco will celebrate its first
anniversary since its reorganization on
| Saturday evening, January 14, at Turn
Vercin Hall, 353 Turk street.
Frequent and spirited rehearsals
! have been held by the society, under
j the direction of Professor S. Lintner,
!in anticipation of the occasion, and
in consequence thereof an excellent
' rendition of the many numbers can
.be expected. Ther will be two instru- j
' mental selections, a piano solo by Mrs. j
i Klitgaard and a violin solo by Mr. <
j Hartwig.
The Swedish Singing Society has
j volunteered to lend its assistance
I for the evening, and the combined
I choruses of the two societies should
i help to make up a programme far I
; more interesting than those given [
'. heretofore by any of the Scandinavian j
; singing societies.
| It is the aim of the society to arouse
and Deroetuate the interest of their
j countrymen in the songs and music of I
the fatherland, which have in the past
been sadly neglected.
The following committees have the

FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE
IN HANDS OF POLICE
Andrew Jackson Smith. Alias James
Guinn, Says He Is Wanted in Ver
mont for Burglary.
A middle-aged man who said his
name was Andrew Jackson Smith sur
prised Sergeant Brown at police head
quarters yesterday by informing him
that he was a fugitive from justice
and desired to surrender himself. The
sergeant took him into Captain Bur
nett, to whom the man told his story.
Smith said he had been convicted of
burglary in Woodstock. Vt., in 1885,
and sentenced to serve fifteen years in
the State's prison at Windsor. In 1887
he was transferred to an asylum at
Brattleboro, from which he made his
escape ten months later. He came to
this State and about four years ago
he was arrested in Madera, Montery
County, for burglary. He was
sentenced to serve four years in San
Quentin under the name of James
Guion and was discharged last month.
The records were examined and
Smith's statement as to serving four
years in San Quentin was verified.
Smith was taken to the City Prison
and the authorities at Brattleboro,
Vt., were notified by wire of his sur
render.
Steamship Men Incorporate.
Articles of incorporation were filed
yesterday by the Steamship Associa
tion of San Francisco, which an
nounces its purpose to promote and
protect ail interests connected with
American shipping on the Pacific
Coast; to maintain general headquar
ters; to provide a place and means for
just, fair, convenient and economic
employment of employes and to ad
vocate legislation for the betterment
of the industry. The capital stock of
the association is $100,000 and the in
corporators are Robert Dollar of San
Rafael, W. G. Tibbetts of Alameda, E.
A. Christenson of San Francisco,
George D. Gray of Oakland, J. R.
Hanify of Sausalito, C. R. Johnson of
Fort Bragg and Robert H. Swayne of
Alameda.
Shares in Whaler's Profits.
In Judge Hunt's court yesterday, a
jury awarded Philip D. Montgomery
judgment for $1500 against Horace P.
Smith as his rightful share In the
profits of trading with natives in the
far, north on a whaling cruise six years
ago. Smith was captain of a vessel
sent out by the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company and Montgomery was the
maÂ£e. They had an agreement, as
they had on other cruises, to divide
the profits of their enterprise. The
cruise in question was. more profitable
than usual and the captain, who was
paid $3000, pocketed the whole
amount. The defendant is now in the
Arctic.

EPPINGER GRAIN
FOR THE BANKS
Trial of Suit to Determine
Manner of Apportionment
Begins Before Murasky
WAREHOUSE CONFUSION
Diagrams and Evidence Of
fered to Show Impossibil
ity of Identifying Lots
The little pile of grainâ3soo tonsâin
the warehouse at Crockett, which was
all that the banks had to show for their
warehouse receipts for 37,500 tons of
wheat and barley given as security by
the Eppingers for loans of more than
a half million dollars, is now at issue
in Judge Murasky's court. True, the
grain has been sold, under an order of
court, and the $102,000 received for it
remains to be distributed among the
creditors, but there is disagreement as
to the manner of its apportionment.
The outcome of the present suit is
expected to determine whether it shall
be prorated among the banks in pro
portion to their claims, or given to
Henry Wadsworth, the Eppingers'
trustee in bankruptcy, for the benefit of
all the creditors of the firm, or given to
the banks according to the specific lots
on hand which were described in the
warehouse receipts. For instance,
Wells-Fargo's bank claimed 1000 tons
of the 3500 tons that remained, and
specified certain lots in the warehouse.
This would leave little for the dozen
other local and rural banks which
loaned their funds so lavishly, and it
is contended that it is imposlble to
identify the separate lots of grain de
scribed by the receipts because they
were moved from warehouse to ware
house, from gangway to gangway, and
new numbers were substituted for old
ones until all were commingled and
confused.
The suit is that of the Nevada Na
tional Bank against the other banks,
Eppinger & Â£0., the Pacific Warehouse
Company arm Henry Wadsworth, the
trustee. A dozen leading members of
the bar are participating and the case
for the plaintiff was presented by At
torney Frank H. Powers. The Nevada [
Bank's claim was for $49,500. It sued
for a determination of the respective !
rights.
The general sideaof the case was put !
forth yesterdayâthe fact that there
was a warehouse and that it contained
separate lots of grain variously desig
nated. This was explained with the â 
maps and diagrams used in the crim- I
inal trial of the Eppingers, and the cvi- I
dence of Qeorge W. Russell, who pre- j
pared them. Frank S. Mitchell, book- I
keeper for the Eppingers, under in- j
structions of the court, had prepared a
list of the various lots and their mark
tags and his testimony thereupon was
taken.
The trial of the case may last for !
three weeks and will be resumed to- i
day.
Complains He Was Robbed.
John Larkin, 308 Leavenworth I
street, was found asleep in a doorway j
on Harrison street, near Third, short
ly after midnight yesterday morning |
by Sergeant McGovern and Policeman
Small. They awakened him and he
walked away toward Fourth street, f*
About an hour later he met Police
men Clancv and Small and told them
he had fallen asleep in a doorway and
had been robbed of a purse contain- i
ing $140. He had no recollection of J
being awakened by the sergeant and
Small. He said the last thing he re- !
membered was drinking in a saloon j
at Kearny street and Montgomery aye- !
nue with "Jack" O'Connell, a baseball j
umpire.
Geber's Trial Proceeding.
The jury to try the case of August :
Geber, charged with the murder of i
Charles Hartmann, at 321 Third 1
street, on July 10, was completed in I
Judge Dunne's court yesterday morn- !
ing. Assistant' District Attorney j
Whiting made the opening statement,
and the trial proceeded. The wit
nesses examined were Corporal George
Russeli of the Police Department, Dr.
John J. Kingwell. George Hartmann*
and Susannah Hartmann, father and
mother of the murdered man, and P.
Ploner. Their evidence was the same
as at the preliminary examination.
Geber seems to take no interest what
ever in the proceedings.

POLICE BOARD
SEATS POHEIM
Commissioner Begins Work
by Favoring Renewal of
the Restaurant Licenses
WEEK'S GRACE IS GIVEN
Resorts Must Make Changes
to Comply With Law or
Permits Will Be Refused
Without any special ceremony Dr.
Joseph F. Poheim, appointed to the
Board of Police Commissioners by the
Mayor, presented his credentials last
night at the regular meeting and at
once began his official duties. The
election of a board president was not
referred to during the evening and
will be decided at a later session.
The proprietors of three French
restaurants, the Old Poodle Dog, Del
monico's and the Bay State, appeared
last night before the Board of Police
Commissioners to ask for a renewal
of their licenses to retail liquor in
their places of business. The licenses
of all three places expired during the
past two weeks and the board has re
fused renewals unless the proprietors
comply with the municipal ordinance
prohibiting the sale of liquor to rooms
over restaurants.
j Nathan M. Adler, proprietor of the
I Bay state, asked for a continuance of
â  one week to enable him to make ar
i rangements with his landlord to ef
! feet changes so as to comply with the
I ordinance. On a tie vote the applica
, tion was denied as far as concerns the
serving of liquor to the rooms. He
was given permission to run the res
taurant downstairs for one week
more.
Adler appealed from the board's de
cision and solicited the support of
Commissioners Drinkhouse and Po
heim. They were in favor of grant
ing the week's extension for the en
tire establishment. Commissioners
Hutton and Reagan steadfastly voted
against allowing liquor to be sold In
the rooms.
j Commissioner Drinkhouse charac
terized the refusal as equivalent to
taking the places away from the pro
! prietors. Commissioner Hutton re-
I torted that It was not a question of
j morality but of the law and that at
I present the places were being con
j ducted in an unlawful manner.
Delmonico's, at 112 O'Farrell street.
I was refused a renewal, but was grant
ed a week's time to make alterations
jto comply with the law and file a new
I application. The board took the same
! action on the license of the Old Poodle
j Dog. A citation was issued to revoke
(the license of the Oberon, 38 O'Farrell
i street.
Patrolman James S. Cook of the
Southern station was found guilty of
not responding to an alarm of fire on
the morning of January 2. He was
fined $25.
Robert Hosman, who was before
the board last week charged with
obtaining money under false pretenses
In connection with his running an in
telligence office at 61 Third street, re
quesMfl the board to transfer his license
to a Miss Rogers, his secretary. The
Commissioners held that the transfer
was no guarantee that the business
would be conducted legally and voted
to revoke the license.
The Grand Jury sent a communica
tion to the Police Commissioners ask
ing them to postpone the hearing of
charges of corruption Tn Chinatown
against Sergeants Ellis, Fraher and
Brophy and Patrolmen Doran, Heinz,
O'Brien, McGrath and Munn. The
hearing was accordingly postponed
until next Wednesday evening.
At midnight the board went Into
executive session to discuss the French
restaurant question and to review the
regulations of the department in rela
tion thereto.
INSANE PATIENT FIGHTS
WITH HOSPITAL ATTENDANTS
His Suddenly Acquired Strength Made
It Necessary for Several Men
to Subdue Him.
With suddenly acquired almost
superhuman strength an Insane pa
tient struggled with all of the ferocity
of a wild animal in an effort to gain his
freedom yesterday afternoon in the
Detention Hospital at the City Hall.
The man is David Curry. He made
an attack on Steward Mannville, who
was escorting him to the detention
ward. The maniac was strangling the
attendant when Edward H. Riis, a re
porter, came to his assistance. Riis
dragged the madman from the stew
ard and the lunatic turned upon him.
A rough and tumble fight followed.
Riis suddenly received a stunning
blow in the face which staggered him.
Assistance came in the persons of
Steward Devere, Ambulance Driver
Rix, Chief Steward Charles Beecher
and Chief Matron Mrs. Floyd Cannon.
The tussle was further enlivened by
the arrival of two policemen. Curry
was conquered and strapped to a bed,
not, however, until he had left marks
upon those who tried to subdue him.
Chief Matron Cannon received a blow
on the left wrist which will cause her
to carry her arm in a sling for a few
weeks, while Riis is nursing a con
tused and lacerated lip. All of the
others have cuts, bruises and contu
sions.
When the unfortunate man came to
his senses shortly after the struggle
he regretted what he had done and
gave an account of himself In a clear
and intelligent way. He said he is
a native of British Columbia and had
been in Arizona, where he was con
fined in a lunatic asylum but was dis
charged as cured. Last Sunday, while
at work in San Mateo, he felt his in
sane spell returning and at once has
tened to this city, where he told his
story to Dr. Carl G. Wilson at the
Emergency Hospital.
ELECTRIC CONTACT MELTS
RINGS ON LIEB'S FINGER
Caterer of the St. Francis Hotel Meets
With Painful Accident After
a Banauet.
Caterer Lieb of the St. Francis Ho
tel met with a peculiar and painful
accident Monday night that has re
sulted in his right hand being placed
on the disabled list. A wedding feast
had just come to a close on the mez
zanine floor of the hotel when Lieb
opened the door of an electric switch
board located in the corridor and pro
ceeded to turn off the electric lights in
the room in which the banquet had
been held. His little finger was
adorned with two plain gold rings
that came In contact with a live wire.
Suddenly there was- a loud report and
Lieb was knocked backward by a ter
rific shock.
Recovering, he glanced at his hand
to discover that the two gold rings
had been melted together and were
sizzling in the burning flesh of his
finger. A physician was summoned
and Anally succeeded in removing the
gold bands and dressing the disfigured
digit of the caterer, who will not en-
Joy the use of his right hand for some
time.

special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Jan. 10.â"Come to Cali
fornia and have a good time. Prune
your appetites under our prune trees.
Make dates under a date palm. Go
out to the Cliff House and yell at the
seals. Hop through Chinatown and
take tea with the Japs. Let the Juices
of our vineyards warm the tendrils of
your hearts, and if you don't go 'nut
ty' over the California climate under
our walnut trees, I miss my guess."
Such arguments as these, coming from
C. W. Coe of San Jose, are winning the
fight of San Francisco for the next
convention of the livestock men. Coe
also is giving to everyone who vlslta
the California headquarters a package
of prunes. The California delegation
is almost sure to ~et the next conven
tion. The Los Angeles contingent,
which had been credited with having
an eye on the gathering, is to Join
hands with the San Franciscans.
Chicago and Kansas City were cred
ited with wanting the convention of
1906, but diligent inquiry among the
delegates from these cities failed to
reveal any one who was boosting for
them. Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas,
would like to secure the gathering,
but it is unlikely that they can mus
ter enough support.
A hot fight has broken out in the
ranks of the National Livestock As
sociation over the question of whether
the railroads and packers are to have
representation on the governing board
of the association.
President Frank J. Hagenbarth iÂ«
in favor of the plan and has urged
it strongly. There is a heavy conting
ent of stockmen, particularly those
from the West, who are opposed to' thÂ»
idea, and they are snaking a strong
fight to keep the management of the
organization solely in the hands of the
men who are actively engaged in the
handling or care of stock.
The committee to which the matter
was referred met as a whole to-night
and will report to-morrow to tne gen
eral convention.
The probability is that the -ailroada
will be denied representation on the
Board of Control of the Livestock As
sociation. The general committee of
the livestock industry could not reach
an agreement to-night and will meet
again in the morning. The feeling
manifested against the admission of
the railroads was very strong and the
discussion grew so animated that it
was thought best to adjourn without
action. The packers and all other al
lied industries will probably be ad
mitted, and the railroads alone left
out.
With 1000 delegates in attendance
the annual meeting of the National
Livestock Association was called to
order this morning by President F. J.
Hagenbarth. After the president's ad
dress, John W. Springer of Denver, for
eight years president of the Livestock
Association, spoke in memory of the
members of the association who had
died.
The convention then took up the
question of reorganization and wae
busily engaged with it for several
hours.
The convention of the National Wool
Growers' Association was held this
afternoon and all the old officers and
members of the executive committee
were re-elected. A meeting of the
Western Cattlemen was also held in
the afternoon and a number of papers
were read on the problem of con
trolling cattle scabies.

W.-ather Bureau, is as follows:
' GENERAL SUMMARY.
' "rfre weather has been cool, cloudy and foggy
in-.nearly all parts of the State since the first
â¢'of''the-month, with frequent frosts. Generous
rains' h;.ve fallen In all sections since the close
â¢of the -last weekly report, and the southern
districts have been immeasurably benefited.
Th>'" high winds caused no damage.
" l?arry sown grain is" in excellent condition in
.most'places, though its growth has been slow
"â¢during the cold and foggy weather. A large
i 'aCrtfago has been sown to wheat, oats and bar

I . Ploying, and -seeding are progressing In all
.buttons, and are nearly completed in some
'ida'ces Grean A-ed is plentiful and of good
duaVit>- in the central and northern sections

f 'during the latter, part of December and up to
rha*close -of the -a-nek have materially changed
eri id' conditions in Southern California and the
Harr-Joaquin ' Valley, as well as the southern
.coast, districts, and the outlook for grain and
â¢grass in all those sections Is far better than at
thist-'time last year. Some of the dry-sown
(train in Southern .California is up and looking
very wjl, and the hillsides are becoming green.
' Oti'rigt harvest is in progress in Southen.
and -.he Cloverdale districts and
completed elsewhere. Good crops have been
: ecured-in. the Porterville and Orovllle districts
a.jid-..the. yield is turning out better than ex-
Pt"ctÂ»s<r .fn portions of Southern California.
Oranges and lenjons have matured earlier than
'rhe.-crop -of" last year and the yield In most

~ SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAâ Frequent rains
since the latter part of December and up to

proved the condition of all crops. The soil is
nov in excellent condition, and plowing and
Feeding are progressing rapidly. Some of the

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 10.â To-day's unimpor
tant sjcfck market was very similar to that
oi .yesterday, except that to-day the neglect
v as-ev.-n more pronounced, the early rise '.ess
â¢ 'v!Â» irotis and the reaction not so sharp- As a
â¢'trial'at speculative sentiment on the part W
' rhe-professional element it followed yesterday"*
dines almost exactly and demonstrated quite
â¢ clearly 'that a momentary advance in prices
. has .no fpow.er yet to attract public opinion."
'here wais apprehension, Indeed, that the a<l-
In prices was made to afford a basis
yor'*elling of the present speculative holdings,
but the. oharacter of th(" market did not offer
much '.intrinsic probability for this view. Deal
ings . were much larger on the advance than
â in -the decline. That is to say, in the phrase
the hoard room, the market bulled hard, but
_r\HnM was :io notable pressure to sell and such
r- 'as ihdte \vas was not pushed at the lower .
â¢level of' prices. Succh A condition serves to
dissuade the bears from making short sales
In the market. The trading ts so narrow and
' d'f so .highly professional a character as to lend
.Itself to description only in technical terms.
The-appearance of a published interview by aii
active gpee'Ulatlve leader professing extremely
hopeful views of higher prices aroused but
tepid interest, on account of some of the
market precedents as to former responses to
similar outgivings. Attention was given to
tho active discussion in the political world
of the prospect for tariff revision and the
probable period for the undertaking, and the
activity of this discussion modified to some
extent the feeling caused by yesterday's con
viction that no action would be taken at *.-ie
present session of Congress. A reduction in
the German bank rate, while it marked the
cessation of the drawing of gold to that cen
ter, was obviously designed to prepare the
money market for the placing of the Russian,
lean and the reports received later in the day
of the prospective success of that loan re
lieved some apprehension of a shock to the
financial world due to earlier reports that the
Usue would prove unsuccessful. Meantime the
strong attraction for gold at Paris continued,
as did the preparations for further large *'aÂ»;>
ments from New York, The official state
ment of the production of gold on the Ratio,
for December, giving output as 362,264 ounces,
attracted attention on account of the unin
terrupted expansion shown In the monthly rate
of output from that center. The maximum
monthly production of gold In the TranÂ«vaul
Is 459,709 ounces In August, 1899. The pre
sent rate of Increase, which has gone on stead,
lly since the resumption after '.he Boer war,
thus promises to bring the supply from that
field Up to the maximum within the next year. ;
The importance of this large source of repkn- ;
ishment for the world's stock of gold must i
be taken account of In the consideration of the
money and financial prospect. Professional at
tention centered on the Pacifies. Not much
of the early advances was left at the clos
lic. which was heavy.
There was much variety in the bond market,
but prices moved irregularly. Toi.il sales, par
value. $3,755,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the las., call.

CHICAGO BOARD OP TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 10.âThe whent market at 1
the opening gave evidence of some willing
ness to sell below the figures current at the
end of the previous day's session. Initial
quotations on May were unchanged to %c
lower at $1 17 to $1 17%. The factor that
Inspired the early selling was a decline In
prices at Liverpool. Aside from the weak
ness of foreign grain markets, however,
the tenor of general news was bullish.
Northwestern receipts were small and the
extreme cold weather In the Northwest prom
ised a continuance of light movement from
the farms. The visible supply statistics
showed a decrease of 353.000 bushels. As a
result bearish sentiment in the pit soon gave
way and the market became remarkably
strong. Shorts were anxious buyers and
quickly bid up the price of May to $l 18%, a j
price only a trifle below the high point
touched during the speculative furor due to
the Northwestern crop calamity. Later in.
the day all of tho advance was lost and
prices dropped to a point considerably below
yesterday's closing. May selling off to $1 16%.
The break was due largely to heavy realiz
ing sales by a leader of the bull clique.
There was also moderate selling resulting
from a partial let-up In the demand for cash
wheat at Minneapolis. The market closed
rather weak, %c lower, with May at $1 16%.
The corn market was comparatively Arm in
spite of lower prices at Liverpool. May
closed at 44% c, a shade higher.
Oats were dull. May closed %c higher at
31 %c.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT FREIGHTS âThe demoralization
seems complete. The best rate now obtain
able for European business is said to be 12s 6d.
which is ridiculously low and no spot char
ters are reported. The chartered Wheat fleet
in port has a registered tonnage of 6845,
against 7300 tons on the same date last year;
disengaged, 36,780. against 110,000; on the way
to this port. 177,435 tons, against 188,600.
Mall advices from Sydney, under date of
December 12. say: Wheat chartering for Byd
. ney loading' has ceased, as It Is now very
I certain that tha yield will be seriously short
iof expectation formed on outlook a month
1 ago. Harvesting is now fairly general, the
j results being. In many cases, most disappoint
ing. Millers are scrambling for new crop
grain at prices much about export basis. We
shall not be surprised if some charterers seek
to cancel a portion of their fixtures, while
we look upon a decline in freight rates from
Australian ports as inevitable.
This condition will probably stop the move
ment of vessels from this port to Australia,
seeking business, and is an Important factor in
the current decline In rates.
WHEATâForeign futures were weak. Chi
cago was fractionally lower. Most of the wires
being prostrated, there was no news of any
consequence beyond the bare quotations from
the East. This market was unchanged as to
the cash grain, but lower as to futures, with
May active and December quiet.

all around, as will be seen by the new quota

firm and the latter are reported scarce. Llmas
alone are weak and quiet, being affected by
the recent rains in the southern districts.
There is nothing new in Seeds.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market is active and firm, with
fancy Burbanks passing out of receivers'
hands as fast as they come lh. There Is quite
an accumulation of low-grade river Burbanks
on the market and they are selling slowly.
There were no fresh Sweets received yesterday
and old stock ruled firm at the previously
quoted rates. Receipts of Onions have been
light for some time and stocks have been re
duced considerably. The best lots readily
brought an advance yesterday.
Offerings of southern vegetables consisted
chiefly of carrled-over stock, fresh receipts
being light, as usual on Tuesday. Choice Egg
Plant was scarce and higher and Peas did
better. The Mexican Tomatoes that came In
on the preceding day were still In receivers'
hands, the price. $1 75 per crate, being more
than the trade cared to pay.

Poultry and Game.
The Poultry market waa In excellent shape
for sellers, receipts being; light and the de
mand brisk, and nearly everything in the
chicken line was quoted higher. A car of
Western stock was marketed, making the third
for the current week, and the receipts from
domestic shipping points were only 48 coops.
Game was In free supply and rather weak.

Butter, Cheese and Eesrs.
The Butter market continues dull, with most
dealers complaining of an oversupply and will,
ing to meet buyers half way. Quotations,
however, show no change. Cheese also con
tinues quiet at previous prices, with ample
supplies on hand.
Another slight decline in Eggs is noted. The
accumulation of receipts is slowly becoming
more marked, and all houses are anxious to
get the goods off their floors. All. grades of
Eastern are practically cleaned up and are
therefore no longer quotable.
Receipts were 20,800 lbs Butter, 550 cases
Eggs and 6700 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrug Fruits.
There was a limited Inquiry for fancy Navel
Oranges for shipment to Honolulu, but other
wise the market for Citrus Fruits was quiet,
local trade being of small volume owing to the
continued cool weather. The Apple market was
firm and active, particularly for the upper
grades, and occasional sales of fancy New
town Pippins and Spitxenbergs were reported
at $1 6001 75 per box. Persimmons. Pears
and Bananas were in ample supply and quiet
at the long-established quotations.

Dried Fruits, Nuts. Raisins, Honey.
All Fruits continue quiet at the familiar
prices, and beyond the Increased firmness in
Peaches noted yesterday the market has not
made any material change for some time. The
old story is again repeated that stocks of
everything except Prunes, Raisins and Honey
are small and broken.
Italian Chestnuts are lower.

COMMISSIONERS
ASSUME OFFICE
Aigeltinger and Egan Take
Seats on Works Board, and
.Maestretti Is President
VACANCIES NOT FILLED
W. H. Metson and Dr. F. J.
Tillman May Be Named on
Health and Park Bodies
The newly appointed Commissioners
erf Public Works Edward H. Aigeltinger
and Thomas F. Egan took their oaths
of oftice before the Mayor yesterday
and received their commissions after
filing their official bonds. Egan, who
had positively declared that he would
not accept the appointment because he
had been given Herbert Schmitz's un
expired term of one year instead of the
three-year term, evidently realized that
one-third of a loaf is better than none,
for after another conversation with the
Mayor he decided to change his mind
about refusing and signified his ac
ceptance of the office.
Aigeltinger and Egan at once re
paired to the meeting room of the
Board of Works, where Commissioner
Maestretti and retiring ommissioner
Schmitz were on hand to meet them.
The new Commissioners took their seats
and listened to a short speech from
Schmitz. in which he eulogized his for
mer colleague, Commissioner Maestret
ti, who was at once elected president of
the board, being placed in nomination
for the honorary position by Aigel
tinger. The beard then adjourned until
the regular meeting to-day. Both Aig
eltinger and Egan filed official bonds
with personal sureties.
The Mayor did not announce his se
lections yesterday for the vacancies on
the Park and Health boards to suc
ceed Frank Sullivan and Dr. Poheim,
now Police Commissioner. The place
on the Health Board has been offered
to Dr. Frank J. Tillman, who was de
posed from his position as assistant in
the laboratory by the very board upon
Which the Mayor desires to place him.
Tillman has indicated that he

friend of the Mayor and on that ac
â¢ count and because he more nearly rep
resents Ihe new school of medicine has
he been decided upon for the appoint
ment. William H. Metson is still men
tioned for the Park Commissionership.
"Doc" Leahy was offered the place, but
declined and made a special request of
â¢ the Mayor that Metson be appointed.
There are three secretaryships of
commissions to which new appoint
ments will t)e made in a few days.
They are those of the Park, Public
Works and Police boards. The scheme
, as outlined includes the appointment of
James de Succa as storekeeper of the.
Board of Education to succeed Thomas
Egan and the naming of Herbert
Schmitz to be secretary of the Park
Commission. There are several aspir
ants for secretary of the Police Board,
now that Alexander O'Grady has de
clared that he does not want it. Among
th.se is Barney Flood, an assistant
bond and warrant clerk, who is a
strong candidate for the place.
GRAND JURY TAKES UP
ELECTION BOARD CASE
Commissioners to Be Accused Again in
Connection With Appointments
of Primary Officers.
The ElecUon Commissioners are not
yet clear of Grand Jury entangle
ments. Although the charges pre
ferred by the former inquisitorial
body were dismissed by Judge Law
lor, the prosecution is to be renewed.
The present Grand Jury yesterday
took up the inquiry of appointment of
election officers for the primaries held
In August last, and it is thought the
accusation of malfeasance, demanding
the removal of the board, will be pre
sented at the next meeting, which is
to be held on Friday. It has been
generally known that the jurors would
file new accusations to correct the
technical defects of the previous
bills.
The Grand Jury also spent some
time yesterday in considering the mat
ter of police corruption in China
town. The investigation has been at
a standstill for some time. Police
Commissioners Reagan and Drink
house, in a conference with Fore
man Andrews, agreed not to take up
their trial of the accused police
officers until the Grand Jury shall
}iave concluded its inquiry.

STILL FIGHTING
TO BREAK WILL
Legal Battle for Alexander
Dunsmuir's Millions Is
Being Vigorously Waged
QUOTES AUTHOEITIES
J. C. Campbell, Attorney for
Mrs. Edna Wallace Hopper,
Makes Lengthy Arguments
The legal fight before Judge Cof
fey over the will of the late Alexander
Dunsmuir is growing warm. As on
the first day of the hearing, J. C.
Campbell, attorney for Edna Wallace
Hopper, was yesterday the central fig
ure at both the morning and after
noon session of the court. His argu
ment was based on the contention
that the will had not been probated
according to the laws of this State,
and hence had no standing in the
courts.
The law of the State of California
was very plain upon the subject of the
probating of a domestic will, he said,
and it was equally clear upon the pro
bating of a foreign will.
Mr. Campbell stated that Alexan
der Dunsmuir's home was San Fran
cisco. The will particularly stated
this to be a fact. To be in full ac
cord with the law the will should
have been probated in San Francisco
County and in this State. The wit
nesses to the signature to the will and
those interested in the will should
have been cited to appear at the time
the document was probated. None
of these conditions were compiled
with.
TAKEN TO VICTORIA.
The will was taken up to Victoria,
said the attorney, hundreds of miles
away from here, out of the State and
out of this country, and there It was
presented for probate by the chief
beneficiary, James Dunsmuir. At the
time it was probated there neither
one of the two witnesses was there
to testify. After these proceedings
were gone through with an exempli
fied copy of the document was brought
here and offered for probate. Neither
of the witnesses was cited to appear.
The court had no jurisdiction to pro
bate the copy of the will under these
circumstances.
"There was," said Mr. Campbell,
"no such thing as a will under the
common law. It is a statutory pro
vision and must be governed entirely
by the statutes."
* "Suppose the wiU in British Co
lumbia should be set aside? What
law would cover the result?" he
asked. "Would it come under the
statutes of succession of California
or the statutes of succession of British
Columbia?"
POINT IN CASE.
The main point which Mr. Camp
bell wished to bring out was that the
court here had no jurisdiction to pro
bate a copy of a will filed in a foreign
country by a resident of this county
and this State. Our statutes are plain.
The law is mandatory.
C. S. Wheeler, attorney for James
Dunsmuir, would occasionally ask Mr.
Campbell a question, but otherwise
Mr. Campbell had the floor to himself.
He cited authorities to sustain his arÂ»
gument. The case will be resumed
this morning at 11 o'clock before
Judge Coffey, when Mr. Campbell will
conclude his argument.
The same brilliant array of legal
talent that has graced the proceedings
since the trial began was on hand and
listened attentively to Mr. Camp
bell's arguments.
The hearing of the testimony, which
was to have taken place before Con
sul Bennett at 10:30 a. m. to-day, is
postponed.

SOUBRETTES ENGAGE AUTO
AND FAIL TO SETTLE BILL
Spend Two Days in Machine
. and Tour Two Counties.
Art-Admiring Saloon-Keeper Pays
$ 100 and Artists Go Free.
They were introduced to Police Judge
Cabaniss as "The Daudette Sisters,
Vallejo and Benicia," and their attor
ney vouchsafed the further infdrma
tion that they were professional vaude
villians, performing "a double turn"
at one of toe cheap theaters. Their ap
pearance did not belie that statement.
Petite, flashily attired and saucy-faced,
they were the soubrettes of the illus
trated sporting weeklies âthe nocturnal
consumers of cold bottles and warm
birds paid for by paretic old men and
sap-headed young ones.
It was for consuming $100 worth of
automobiling in a single dose and fall
ing to pay for the same that Vallejo
and Benicia were before his Honor
Cabaniss. The complaining chauffeur
| testified in bitter tone that they Jointly
; hired his machine and jointly occupied
I it, except during brief visits to way
! side cafes, while he whirled them to
I San Jose and over two-thirds of Santa
! Clara County's area and back to San
! Francisco, the round journey consum
! ing almost two days. When he depos
i ited them at the place of beginning,
Ellis and Powell streets, they gracious
: ly thanked him for giving them one of
; the nicest times they ever had and ex
| pressed regret that they were unable
) to prove their gratitude in a pecuniary
> way. Horror-stricken, he summoned
j Patrolman "Dave" Murphy and gave
! them into custody, apparently much to
their surprise and undoubtedly much to
their indigation.
"Ye don't mean to say, kid, that ye're
gettin' us pinched?" exclaimed Vallejo,
who, by the way, is called "Valley" for
short. \
"For Gawd's sake, officer, ye ain't
a-goin' to rush us to jail in th' hurry
up wagon?" was the expostulation ut
tered by Benicia, who is addressed as
"Bennie" by the bird-and-bottle buyers
hereinbefore alluded to.
Then they threatened to "throw a fit"
right there and then if the indignity of
I being conveyed to prison in a patrol
I wagon was insisted on, and to avert
j such an indelicate double turn, also to
! get his prisoners away from the midst
lof a rapidly accumulating and unani
! mously sympathetic crowd, the police
j man bundled them Into the auto and
i thus they were hurried to the Central
station.
"If our parents in Spokane knew we
were in such' a fix as this they'd die
right there," quoth Bennie to her custo
dian.
"Naw, they wouldn't do nothin' of
the kind," put in Valley; "they'd Jist
tap the ticker an' send us $10,000 to
pay our fine âthat's what they'd do."
"Folks rich, eh?" queried the officer.
"They've nothin but dough," was
Bennies affirmative, and Valley said:
"Aw, naw; they ain't rich. They're only
wealthy, that's all. Say, kid, they have
money enough to buy a million mer
chines like this'n we're ridin' in."
The desk sergeant discovered that
about six months ago the Daudette sis
ters were accused-of vagrancy before
Judge Fritz, who dismissed them on
condition that they return to Spokane.
They did so, but came a few weeks ago
under engagement as song-and-dance
artists.
While the Judge was wondering what
he would better do with the young
women the chauffeur was approached
by one Mr. Beauregard, a Sixth-street
saloon-keeper,who generously offered to
pay him the $100 demanded if he would
decline to prosecute. The offer was
promptly accepted and the defendants
discharged.
Mr. Beauregard insisted on having it
understood that his intercession was
prompted purely by desire to aid art in
distress.

It was his imprudent desire to be
free of social obligation Mhat led to
Louis Ponzev's arrest. He was im
pecunious when a friend of his per
suaded him to accept numerous drinks
of whisky, and being unable to recip
rocate in kind he took his friend rid
ing in a buggy which he found at
tached to a horse in front of a Mont
: gomery-street realty office. The ve
| hicle was taken without its owner's
I permission, but Louis pleaded that his
j intention was not larcenous, but mere
j ly to retain the rig long enough to en-
I able him to utilize it in the payment
I of the liquefied courtesies received from
j his friend. Judge Conlan gave Louis
1 three months for borrowing without
thelender's knowledge.

Horace Angel operated a camera by
day and led the cotillons in Portuguese
John's dance hall, on Pacific street, by
night until a policeman, being un
aware of his daylight vocation, arrest
ed him for wearing fashionable rai
ment and having no visible means of
obtaining it honestly.
Nervously toying with a budding
blond mustache, Mr. Angel proved
â  himself a fairly industrious profes
| sional photographer to the satisfac
> tion of Judge Mogan, and his explana
! tion of why he made an apartment on
the second floor of Portuguese John's
j temple of Terpsichore hlB permanent
| dwelling place was also accepted as
logical and earned his dismissal. So
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
passionately fond was he of dancing
and dance music, he said, that his
evenings were divided between indulg
ence in the exhilarating exercise and
absorption of the melodious strains
that wafted to his room from Portu
guese John's orchestra, consisting of a
piano, a banjo and an accordeon. Be
sides, long practlqe on the waxed
floor had made him such an adept in
all kinds of dances, from the stately
minuet to the more modern "rag,"
that his services were frequent
ly in demand to complete a "set," and
appreciation of his value in that re
spect induced Portuguese John to
charge him a very low room rental, so
as to have him convenient when he was
wanted to "All in." Of course his
modest income from the taking of
snapshots and the developing of nega
tives would not suffice to defray the
cost of his dancing if he were obliged
to pay regular rates for it. Any
lady or gentleman connected with Por
tuguese John's establishment could
and would be pleased to corroborate
every word he had said.
But his unsupported word sufficed.
Â» â¢ Â»
Mrs. Rita Pratt emphatically de
clared that she was entitled to retain
possession of the garments which Miss
Paula Carter sought to recover via
the search-warrant route.
"After all I have done for that girl
this is a nice way to be treated by
her," sail Mrs. Pratt to Judge Mogan.
"My husband and I took her into our
home, at 725 Ellis street, and did ev
erything to make her feel as if she
was a member of our family. We took
her in to keep her away from bad
company, as we had known her par
ents, who were very respectable peo
ple, but after staying with us two
weeks she went off on her own hook
again. I'm keeping her things because
she's not trying to do right. A horse
man has her in tow. After treating
me so meanly I just wanted to show
her that I, too, could be mean, .and
you may as well tell her that until
she pays me $5 for the room and
board I gave her she won't get that
tailor-made and that wrapper and
that silk skirt and that shirt waist
and that pair of gloves and that box
of handkerchiefs and that lingerie."
Miss Carter did not appear to push
her complaint against Mrs. Pratt, and
the Judge continued the case until
the young woman finds it convenient
to visit the courtroom.
â¢ * â¢
Mrs. Margaret Murray of 16 Priest
street professed inability to understand
the sense of Justice that prompted
Judge Mogan to aid and abet her ar
rest and arraignment on the charge of
having battered the head of her 17
--year-old daughter Rose with a kitchen
poker, thereby inflicting a deep scalp
wound and several minor abrasions. If
the law, Mrs. Murray opined, proposes
to prevent maternal discipline of a
revolutionary child, then the law would
better be abolished and society permit
ted to obey its individual dictates as
to what is right and what is wrong.
Things have come to a pretty pass, in
deed, the lady declared, when any chit
of a girl can go before a magistrate
and effect her mother's arrest for ad
ministering corporal punishment. Had
the magistrate she then was address
ing ever heard of an adage relative to
thfe sparing of rods and the spoiling of
children? If not, he would better con
sult his Solomon.
The court bore meekly the rebuke
and as meekly hearkened to the oral
painting of Mrs. Murray's character in
rather somber colors by several of her
neighbors, who had been summoned as
witnesses for the prosecution. They
testified that she was a common scold
and much given to inebriety; that her
husband was forced to abandon her be
cause of her behavior; that her chil
dren were marvels of goodness, con
sidering their home life, and that a
term ln prison would not be a bad
thing for her or anybody connected
with her.
Then the defendant was ordered into
custody as the result of her having
tried to intimidate the complainant by
threatening to accuse her of wayward
ness and request that she be placed in
a reformatory institution. The girl â¢
testified that, she was employed as a
domestic and contributed $10 of her
monthly earnings to her mother, whose
display of ill-temper and incidental
poker nourishing were provoked by her
inability to obtain more money.
The mother will be sentenced to-day.
For practicing medicine without a
license on Seventh street Julian Waller
was fined $100 by Judge Cabaniss.

The proposition to establish a home
i for aged members of their union, that
j was brought up at the previous con
| vention of the Bricklayers' and Ma
j son's International Union at Trenton,
I Pa., was discussed again at yester
â¢ day's session of that body at Pioneer
! Hall. Delegate James Sullivan talked
;on the project, which will be finally
I settled before the adjournment in this
city. A corporation has asked the
international body for the privilege of
raising funds for the establishment of
| such a home, which is expected to be
I self-supporting.
The missing trunks of the delegates
j were found yesterday and prevented
J a great deal of inconvenience, as many
of them contained documents to be
read before the convention. The trunks
had been at the depot for a couple of
days. It seems the routing had been
changed and they came over the Sun
set route.
A number of resolutions were intro
duced in reference to rules. They were
referred to the proper committees.
Miss Emma Lanphere of Chicago, gen
eral organizer of the Retail Clerks'
i Association, and Mr. O'Dell were
granted permission to address the con
vention to-day.
A beautiful testimonial was present
ed to Philadelphia Union No. 1 by the
I convention as a token of appreciation
) of their hospitality to the delegates of
I the last convention at Trenton. The
{ testimonial is a cleverly made arch

of Boston Union.
The presentation speech was made
by President William J. Bowen. R, H.

Union responded with an appropriate
speech.
A meeting; of those interested in
State conference legislation was held
at recess to agree on some uniform

ABSCONDS WITH
UNION'S FUNDS
Warrant Issued for Arrest
of Maurice Donahue, Trus
tee of the Cooks' Society
For nearly a month the members of
Cooks* Union No. 44 have been aware
of the fact that one of their trustees
had absconded with $1230 of the
funds of the union, but for reasons
best known to themselves they have
tried to keep the matter from the pub
lic. The fact became known yesterday,
when Charles A. H. Smith, business
agent of the union, with headquarters
at 107 Mason street, swore to a war
rant before Police Judge Conlan for
the arrest of Maurice Donahue on a
charge of felony embezzlement.
Donahue is the absconding trustee
and so far no trace of him has been
found. It appears that during a
strike at one of the leading restau
rants in the early part of last month
members of the union became uneasy,
as they were threatened with suits
for damages, writs of injunction and
other legal procedure. A meeting
was held and it was decided to with
draw the funds amounting to $1230
from the treasurer's hands and the
bank and deposit them in the vaults
of the Columbian Banking, Company.
Trustee Donahue was ' entrusted
with the task and he withdrew the
money from bank on December 14.
He disappeared about that time and
when inquiry was made it was dis
covered that Donahue had deposited
the money in the vaults in the name
of R. S. Roberts and , had obtained
the key to the box. When the box
was opened with a duplicate key it
was found to be empty.
A call was made by an anxious del
egation at 34 Hawthorne street, where
Donahue lived, and it was learned
that on the night of December 14
Donahue packed his grip, saying he
was going on a short trip, and that
was the last seen or heard of him.
The police now have charge of the
case and every effort will be mad* to
locate the missing trustee.
MONNIER FAMILY TROUBLES
ARE DENIED BY THE WIDOW
Says She Did Not Call George Bad
Names and Denies Other Evi
dence Submitted.
A further cross-examination of Mrs.
Anna Monnier and more dirept exam
ination by her attorney kept the wid
ow of the wine d#aler on the stand
nearly all of yesterday, and the onl#
other witness was Miss Esther Har
din, who visited the Monnier home on
occasions. She declared that George
Monnier Jr. used bad language to
ward his father and mother, and she
told of an instance when, the young
man having either lost or pawned his
overcoat, the father became so indig
nant that he proclaimed that he
would never leave the* boy anything
in his will.
Mrs. Monnier was questiohed at
length regarding the many stories of
trouble in the family and' of the
father's attitude toward the boy. She
denied a great deal of the evidence
given by George and his wife and was
particularly emphatic in saying that
ihe had not called him an unmen~
tionable name. "If he says I did he's
a liar," said the angry witness.
Mr. Sullivan asked her about a will
made by Monnier in 1896, in which, it
was rumored, half of his fortune had
been left to the adopted son. She
said that her husband had given her
the will to read, but she had not
enough curiosity to peruse it. It had
been laid away in the safe and was
not destroyed until 1901, a long time
after the second will, in which George
was disinherited, was made.
