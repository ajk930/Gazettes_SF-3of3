ists on their way to the State Park hi
a ' four-in-hand were saved from &
frightful death on the Waterman
Creek grade Tuesday by the sagacity;
of a dog. .
. Tha driver had alighted at a spring
to drink, leaving the reins wrapped
around the brake. A shot fired by a
hunter near, by frightened the horses
and the. animals plunged forward, pull
ing the, reins loose and trailing them
on the ground out of reach of those in
the rig. .
Along the edge of a frightful precipice
dashed the horses. The vehicle was
tossed about like a cork in the ocean.
Death to the tourt3ts seemed certain.
Suddenly. the speed of the horses was
checked. From their mad gallop they
settled into a steady trot. With a
prayer of thankfulness, the tourists
leaped from the four-in-hand and one
of them made a grasp for the reins.
Then he saw to what was due their
safety. It was the driver's dog.
The animal had leaped from the rig
with his master. He was standing near
the wheel when the horses , started.
When the reins fell he grasped them
in his mouth and. though dragged over
the rough and rocky road, held on. The
weight â¢ of the dog's body and the
strength with which the canine pulled
on the reins was felt by the horses, and
as they got over their fright they
yfelded to the pressure.
The dog. in the future, will be a regu
lar passenger on. the four-in-hand.

A BOON TO ROOSEVELT
NEW YORK, Oct. 20.â Both Demo

to-day that predicted to their satisfac
tion the election of their candidates for
the Presidency.
'Senator Scott of West Virginia gave
out Republican claim. "I believe," he
said, "that Judge Parker will be beaten
as badly as Greeleyiwas in 1872. New
York State, in my opinion, will give
Roosevelt a majority ranging from

In Rebstock's case twelve jurymen
voted to indict, but no vote' was taken
after the District Attorney had f ormu -
lated the charge , In writing. The jury
proceeded at once, Into court and the
Sheriff had to be sent after three Jurors,
who refused to come 'into court, in or
der to make up a quorum.
According to Judge Lawlor's expo
sition of the law to the grand jurors,
the indictment of v Joseph Rebstock for
misconduct while serving as an elec
tion officer in the Eightieth Precinct
will not hold. The Judge says in his
communication that "when the Grand
Jury decides that an indictment shall
be found the District Attorney shall be
called upon to formulate the charge In
writing and, that having been done, the
Grand Jury shall vote on the indict
ment thus prepared, and if twelve or
more votes are cast in favor of the
charge the indictment shall be present
ed to the court in the form of a true
bilL"
The case of the Election Commission
ers was very much overshadowed by
that ot Ruef. The communication from
Judge Lawlor was received, in which
he refused to comply with the request
that he instruct the District Attorney
to proceed against the Commissioners.
In a voluminous exposition of the law
he pointed out that he lacked such au
thority. It was decided to ask the Dis
trict Attorney directly that , he prose
cute the officials who are, alleged to
have flagrantly violated the law in the
appointment of election boards, par
ticularly In those precincts .where
frauds were so boldly , committed at
the, primaries. Assistant District At
torney Whiting was present and he
was requested to have papers ready
at the next meeting, so that action may
be taken toward instituting prosecu
tion. Just what this will be remains
uncertain. Whiting has some points of
law to look up and the situation In the
Grand Jury, there being but ten mem
bers who favor any steps against the
commission, adds to the complications.
It is possible after all that it will
remain for the Merchants' Association
to take. up the prosecution, as it has
decided to do, if the Grand Jury's ef
forts fall.
LAWLOR REFUSES TO ACT.
This closed the inquiry for the day.
Subpenas had been issued for W. S.
Leake, who was interested in the enter
prise when the theater was started, and
for Theodore Rothchild, who had lent
his name to a shareholder. But neither
could be found in the city yesterday.
The case was continued to next Thurs
day, by which time it is expected to
have the subpenas for Leake and Roth
child served.
"I am sure that just because Abe
Ruef was a member of our corporation
the Board of Public Works was more
exacting in its requirements of us,"
Tiffany said, "for the officials did not
â¢wish it to appear that he was enjoying
any advantages." /
Charles Leonhardt Jr., who followed
Tiffany on the stand, had very little
testimony to give, t or he had never at
tended a meeting of the company and
was not conversant with its affairs.
His stock stood in the name of Theo
dore Rotiichild, he said. Further than
the fact that Ruef held an interest, the
witness knew absolutely nothing of the
attorney's connection with the corpora
tion. Nor could he tell of the difficul
ties with the Board of Public Works
when the showhouse was in course of
construction. His mind was a blank
as to everything the Grand Jury was
seeking and the only thing he could
testify to was the payment of an extra
assessment at the time.
Tiffany continued that while the
theater was being fitted up an inspector
from the Board of Public Works stop
ped the work. The board compelled the
company to make many improvements
as a precaution against fire, necessitat
ing an additional expenditure of atrout
$2000.
Asked if Ruef was the attorney for
the company. Tiffany admitted that hie
was. By formal resolution Ruef had
been allowed a fee of $500 for drawing
up the three years* lease and for at
tending to all the company's business
during that time.
For the 793 shares Ruef purchased,
Tiffany said, he has paid assessments
as have the other stockholders. The
first was $3, the second Jl 50 and the
third $1 50, making a total of 54788 that
he had invested in the enterprise.
RUEF MAKES A GOOD PARTNER,
"I thought it would be a good thing
to have Ruef in the company," said the
witness, "and I therefore approached
him with the proposition of taking
some of our stock. He thought It would
be a good Investment and therefore ac
cepted my offer. To be frank, I still
think that I would rather have Ruef
than the ordinary man associated with
me hi business."

"He is gone! He is gone!" she
cried. "He always got cramps when
he went swimming."
Then came Frank Hannah on the
scene with a tale of a strange meet
ing between a man and a woman on
the beach he had witnessed. He de
scribed the man and his description
fitted Dr. Kandor. The description of
the woman was that of Mrs. Kandor.
"That's the woman," 'he cried when
he saw Mrs. Kandor at the hotel.
"She gave the man a bundle and he
walked up the beach and dressed."
And then Mrs. Kandor dried her
tears. stopped her sobbing and
"fessed" up.
"I wanted to Abecome reconciled to
my wealthy auriii" she said. "She did
not like mv husband and I thought
that if she heard that he was drowned
she would forgive me and take me
back into her good graces. My hus
band Is now in San Jose."
"Santa Cruz â treacherous beach â
missing bather" flitted through her
busy mind.
And so it was that pretty Mrs. Kan-.
dor and her husband came to Santa
Cruz. They took a room at the hotel
and Dr. Kandor hired a bathing suit
and hied himself to the beach. Hours
went by and he did not appear. There
was a hurried search of the beach and
the bath houses. The water in the
plunge bath was pumped out, but no
trace , of Dr. Kandor, except the
clothes he left in the bath house, could
be found.
The sight of a pretty woman, with
tears coursing down her cheeks," ex
citedly rushing. about, asking this one
and that one if they had sten aiiyht
of her husband, aroused Santa Cruz'aa
It has not been aroused for years.
Soothing words were, spoken to the
grief-stricken woman. Hope was held
out to her by those who had aban
doned hope, for the sight of her grief
stirred everybody. All day long the
search was kept up, but without suc
cess. Neither Dr. Kandor nor his body
was found.
Mrs. Kandor had the sympathy of
every one. Her room at the hotel was
crowded with kind-hearted persons,
anxious to lighten her burden of brief.
Between her sobs she thanked them.
SANTA CRUZ. Oct 20. â The fertile
brain of the wife of Dr. A. K. Kandor,
an osteopathist of San Francisco, is
responsible for a sensational "myste
rious disappearance of a bather" story
that disturbed the peace and quiet of
the people of Santa Cruz to-day. It
appears that the doctor's wife has a
wealthy aunt, with whom she is very
anxious to stand well. Her marriage
to Kandor caused her to fall a few
pegs In the esteem of her aunt, so Mrs.
Kandor set about devising a scheme
whereby she could again become a fa
vorite. To think with Mrs. Kandor
was to act.

Schmitz said the additional improve
ments the board required after the in
gpector had stopped the work cost $4000.
Manager W. E. Tiffany of the theater
said the extra amount the corporation
had to lay out because of the require
ments of the board was $2000.
Tiffany testified that he is president
of the Baldwin Theater corporation and
that Its capital stock is 2000 shares.
Ruef holds 798 of these in the name of
E. J. Lynch, his law office, clerk, who
serves as secretary for the company.
Marcus Blum, who leads the orchestra,
owns 100 shares in his own right. The
witness denied that Blum was a repre
pentatl\'* of some other person. One
hundred and forty-six shares are own
ed by Theodore Rothchlld, according
to -the books,- but they belong In* fact
to Charles Leonhardt Jr., who conducts
Schmitz was merely asked as to what
his board had done when the theater
â¢was fitted up and why the license had
not been exacted. During the building
cf the stage and the other Improve
ments work was stopped by an Inspec
tor from the Public Works Department
because the requirements of the muni
cipal ordinances were not being fol
lowed. When the company gave assur
ance that it would comply with all reg
ulations the building was allowed to
go on.
Not a word was mentioned about
Ruef during the examination of
Fchmitz. It had been expected that
the president of the Works Board
would be asked if he had received any
Instructions or request from the attor
ney as to the Baldwin Thealer, but
those who are pressing the case say
they were not ready to go Into that
phase.
INSPECTOR STOPPED WORK.
Some of the jurors have expressed
themselves in favor of preferring
charges against the Mayor's brother,
for in their opinion the failure to make
theaters pay license is a misfeasance
for which he and his colleagues ought
to be brought to book. There is a prob
ability that steps will be taken against
them, but the jurors who earnestly
urge the move felt somewhat hopeless
about It last night, because they -can
count on only ten votes In tlie Grand
Jury that will take action reflecting in
any way on the present municipal ad
ministration.
"You think you know everything:
â¢well, you don't," was the beginning of
Schmitz's rejoinder. He gave some
more hot talk, the grand jurors say,
and then Lilienfeld gave him a parting
taJklng-to.
"It is our intention to make final in-
Epections within the next two weeks."
explained the witness, "and then if the
theaters are found to be in proper con
dition the owners will be called upon to
take out the permits. Otherwise they
must close."
"How many months were allowed
them to make the alterations?"
"Eight months."
"Well. I know of theaters that have
been giving shows the last year and a
half without being required to pay a
cent of license to the municipality." In
terposed Foreman Lilienfeld. "Now,
don't you know that the law says no
theater shall open for business without
having obtained a permit from your
beard and having made an accounting
to the License Collector?"
It developed that the Baldwin Thea
ter has not received a permit by the
Public Works Board, as required by
law, and inasmuch as the license col
lector could therefore make no collec
tion it has not been required- to pay
the annual exaction of $200, fixed by the
charter for such places of amusement,
notwithstanding that shows have been
going forward in the place since July.
When called upon to explain,
Schmitz said that the board had given
the theaters time in which to make
alterations so as to comply with the
nrc regulations of the municipality.
SCIIMITZ BECOMES ANGRY.
Among the witnesses before the
Grand Jury was Herbert Schmitz, and
he had a rather exciting experience of
it, for when he was about to leave the
stand Foreman Lilienfeld told him
very plainly that he had been grossly
derelect in his duties as a member of
the Public Works Board, was clearly
guilty of a misdemeanor in not en
forcing the collection of licenses from
many theaters in the city, and ought
to be punished for it.
The pointed remarks of the foreman
were prompted to some extent by what
was regarded as an ugly demeanor on
the part of the president of "the Public
Works Board. He was free in caustic
answers to the jurors who were plying
him with auctions, and was particu
larly Â«=-> *.. I ilipnfrld. â¢ _

A rousing meeting was held last
evening in Mission Turn Verein Hall,
Eighteenth street, near Valencia, un
der the" direction of the Republican
State Central Committee. This was the
first big district meeting planned by
the Republicans. Its purpose was to
further the whole Republican ticket,
and especially to promote the candida
cy of E. A. Hayes, nominee for Con
gressman in the Fifth District; Rich
ard J. Welch, candidate for the Senate
in the Nineteenth District, and Ed

four years of Republican administra
tion', he said, the nation had become,
not a third or a fourth rate power, as
it was when the Republicans took con
trol, but the greatest power not- only of
to-day, but the greatest the world had
ever seen. Under Republican 'admin
istration, he continued, the territory
of the nation had'expanded, had grown,
production and- manufacturing < in
creased and the people enriched, . and
this, he concluded, was due to the in
comparable monetary and tariff sys
tems maintained by -the party.
Mr. Hayes was frequently Interrupted
by applause, and at the conclusion of
his address: cheers and, shouts of- ap
proval rang through the hall.
Charles M. Shortrldge , of San Jose
was the -last, speaker of 'the evening.

clusion calle'd upon the audience to give
its most earnest support to "Mr. Hayes

Senator Welch was received in a
manner that demonstrated his popular
ity in his district. He did not enter
into a discussion of the principles in
volved in the campaign, but won ap
proval by declaring that when he again
goes to Sacramento he will give as
good an account of himself as condi
tions will permit and that he will ever
keep in mind the interests of his con
stituents: Mr. Welch's record in the

he expressed his pleasure, saying, how

As Colonel Mazuma is not doing any
thing to enliven this campaign the ad
vent of Colonel Buttinsky may afford
the people some pleasure. Senator Per
kins was asked yesterday to impart
his views on this contribution:
"In matters of this kind," Senator
Perkins said, "it is not my habit to
claim special glory. I say in a>general
way that the delegation succeeded. I
do not say 'I killed Cock Robin.' â¢
"There is not much comment to make
on this subject. Bell tried and" failed.
The passenger who fails to get aboard
when the train comes along gets left.
The bill was in the House and Bell did
not get aboard. He was left. The Con
gressional Record tells the story... The
amendment was not put in the bill In
any form until the measure came to
the Senate committee. I am willing
tv give the entire delegation, Republi
cans and Democrats", credit â¢ for the
achievement, but if the credit belongs
to any individual it belongs to me."
CAMPBELL WRITES.
Senator Perkins remarked: "I am
amazed at this claim. I do not want
to deprive Mr. Bell of any credit that
belongs to him. He is a nice young
man and I do not deny that he at
tempted to get in the amendment, but
before the bill was reported to the
House from the committee I went to
Foss, Dayton and other members of
the committee and endeavored to have
them include the colliers. Bell tried
the same thing in the House and fail
ed. In the Senate I got the amend-'
ment inserted- It passed the Senate
and went back to the House and the
House struck It out. The conference
committee, of which Beit was not a
member, restored it and the House ul
timately receded from its disagreement
and adopted the report of the confer
ence committee.
PERKINS AMAZED.
"I felt it would be the proudest mo
ment cf my life if I could obtain for
the people of Valiejo and the people of
the entire State what we had been striv
ing to obtain for the last twenty years
âa modern steel vessel to be construct
ed there, and after having OBTAINED
THIS THROUGH MY OWN EF
FORTS. I protest against any man or
any paper asserting that I am at
tempting to steal the credit from an
other man."
The following sentence from Bell's
Woodland speech last Saturday night
was submitted to Senator Perkins:
The Senator replied: '"The idea was
conceived long: before Bell went to
Congress. We built the Monadnock
and Unadilla. The initial credit be
longs to Commodore Sloat, who hoist
ed the American flag at Monterey and
selected Mare Island as the best site
on San Francisco Bay for a navy
jard."
The Senator, continuing, remarked:
"If BÂ»*ll has claimed the sole credit for
building this collier he has lowered
himself in my estimation."
WOODLAND SPEECH.
Ample and convincing proof that
United States Senator Perkins secured
the legislation authorizing the con
struction of a collier at Mare Island
caused a leading Republican yesterday
at the State Central Committee to
exclaim: "The Call's complete and
unanswerable story simply staggers
the Democrats, and It also naggers
some Republicans - at Valiejo, who
eeem to have entertained the notion
that Bell procured the insertion of the
amendment. Bell's deplorable attempt
to appropriate to himself credit belong
ing to another places him in a most
unenviable light. He has lest the re
6pect of the California. Congressional
cielegation."
Senator Perkins was again inter
viewed yesterday. He '.vas asked the
direct question if any sort of an
amendment'relating to the colliers was
contained in the bill when it went
from the House to the Senate. He re
plied at once that Bell made an at
tempt to amend the bill in that re
spect, but failed, n

and not so much attention was given
to the election of legislators. The roll
call developed a Republican majority.
This time there were two Senatorships
to fill. Mantell was chosen at the first
meeting of the caucus, and there was
a sharD contest between Thomas Car
ter, Senator Powers and ex-Senator
Sanders. Mantell and Carter were
elected. This ended the strife for four
years.
\V. A. CLARK UNSEATED.
In 1890 the Legislature was again
Democratic and Clark was â¢ again a
candidate. This was like old times.
In the midst of the contest Senator
Whiteside of Flathead County pre
sented the Speaker with thirty one
thousand dollar bills, saying they had
been given him by one of Clark's lieu
tenants. Some of Clark's following
talked of going over to Toole, the for
mer Governor, but Clark rallied them,
declaring the thirty thousand to be
Daly's money and the whole thing a
trick. Not only did they believe him.
but 1 ; now gained and finally won.
Daly engaged- former Senator Ed
munds and some other of the best legal
talent and prosecuted a contest at
Washington. Charges of bribery and
counter charges of conspiracy were
thrashed out before the committee on
privileges and elections of the Senate,
Clark having, of course, taken his seat.
Judgment was rendered unseating him
on the ground that more money had
been spent in securing the election than
was permissible under the law. Sen
ator Clark admitted that he had spent
over a quarter of a million â the law in
Montana allows an expenditure of
$1000.
Senator Clark resigned his seat. Be
fore night of th same day he received
a wire that Lieutenant Governor
Sprigga. Fusionist-Populist, acting in
place of Governor Smith, a pronounced
Daly man, had appointed Clark to suc
ceed himself.
SOME POLITICAL TRICKERY.
A few days prior to Senator Clark
resigning Governor Smith, who was a
lawyer of considerable repute, was en
gaged by one of Clark's lieutenants tc
go to San Francisco to try/i big mining
suit. The Populist Lieutenant Gover
nor was at the time away off in Da
kota. Governor Smith named to act In
his stead during his contemplated ab
sence the president of the Senate, Mor
ris of Beaverhead County, who was al
so a recognized Daly man.
But as Governor Smith passed out
over the south line of the State Lieu
tenant Governor Spriggs came in from
the east, came straight to Helena and
took the Governor's office on the morn
ing that Senator Clark resigned. Some
people said it was sharp practice.

being carefully accompanied, and when
he there learned what had been done
he straightway took the train back to
Helena and undid it. appointing Major

ator. But the Senate adjourned a few
days later and the major did not take
BY S. W. WALL.,
Stall Correspondent of The Call,
HELENA, Mont., Oct. 20.â "Tom"
Carter, as he Is familiarly and rather
affectionately known in. Montana, will
very likely go back to the United States
Senate as the result of the November
election. He is the pre-eminent Re
publican In Montana, although there
are a number of Republicans here. In
any company of men, not speaking of
political parties, former Senator Car
ter could easily be found. As a lawyer
he is esteemed of the first rank. * And
this is more to his credit and that of
his State for the reason that he located
among the somewhat remote mines and
mountains of Montana when a young
man. : v? "'
It will be a rather interesting cir
cumstance to find Tom Carter on one
side of the United States Senate while
W. A. Clark sits on the other, repre
senting Montana. Carter and Clark
were opposing candidates for the office
of Delegate to Congress while Montana,
was a Territory. And while Montana,
as a Territory, had never been any
thing but ' Democratic, Carter won.
That wau because Marcus Daly, a
Democrat, helped him to win and there
began that mighty clash of financial,
giants that has made Montana famous.
It is a spectacular story that I am
tempted to run through â from the be
ginningâbecause there is a climax^ to
it (there is a climax to it every once
in-so-often) that is impending in this
election in November.
HEINZE, DALY'S SUCCESSOR.
Here will be a realignment. Old Mar
cus. Daly- was the political disturber of
the peace from the birth of live poli
tics in Montana until his own death.
W. A. Clark, his antagonist, is prac
tically, oft the stage since he has got
what he wanted and is now in the safe
and quiet harbor of the Senate. But
Daly's place is admirably filled by F.
Augustus Heinze, president of the
United Copperâ* Company, and who
operates along much the same lines ex
cept that Daly found delight in oppos
ing and defeating his competitor's am
bition for honor outside his business,
while Heinze seems to pursue politics
chiefly for business. ; .' :
So successful has he been in this that
his great competitor â at least it was
his competitor at the time â the Amal
gamated Copper Company, which is the
Standard Oil Company, was compelled
to put forth its strength until It com
pelled a Governor, friendly to Heinze,
through a largely signed petition . of
miners; also friendly to Heinze, to call
a special session of the Legislature and
that Legislature to pass laws such as
it desired for its relief as against the
fntrenchments of Heinze. This is not
the story. .1 told thafstory in a pre
vious dispatch. I merely mention the
very curious thing by way of showing
that the death of Marcus Daly and the
temporary "pocketing of W. A. Clark
has not robbed the State of Montana in
any material degree of its resources as
a political spectacle. And,' of "course, it
will not be forgotten that Clark is still
In evidence in this pending campaign
to the extent of some $50,000.
BEGINNING OF THE FIGHT.
It was in 1888 that W. A. Clark was
nominated for Delegate to Congress by
the Democrats, . and there was nothing
to it, for the Republicans were so few.
Marcus Daly, who had a great fol
lowing, congratulated his friend Clark.
The Republican convention was very
dull. Tom Carter, a young lawyer,
consented to take the nomination, for
at least it would advertise him, and
he needed to have attention called to
him. Shortly before election day some
Continued on Page 5, Column 2.
people 'said that Daly was not playing
fair. And that was trueâ that is. if
he owed anything to W. A. Clarkrand
I'm not going into that, for there's a
great difference of opinion and life is
too short. Daly went away the day
before the election and told his pri
vate Â¦ secretary^ to see that the- name of
Tom Carter was on the ballots that
were to be handed out to the boys.
Well, the next year the Territory
was admitted, and there came a ques
tion of who should* go to the Senate,
as well as to the House, this time as a
regular representative. That made
three chances, but, of course, Clark
was for the Senate. He knew more
about politics, too, and there was no
dream life in Montana during the cam
paign that was to elect its State Leg
islature. And, of course, both sides
claimed to have won â so many were
the contests. The Governor, Toole. a
Democrat, recognized the Democrats.
The Republicans put Yale locks on the
State House door and elected W. F.
Sanders and T. C. Powers. The Dem
ocrats elected \V. A. Clark and Martin
Maprinnis. Of course, this is the brief
of it: but there had been some side
plays that one doesn't often witness
when away from Montana.
FUGITIVE LEGISLATORS.
Fearful of the machinery of the
courts some Democratic Senators had
taken a special train to flee from the
State, that the aggressive Republicans
might not have a Quorum, and the
Lieutenant Governor, a Republican,
telegraphed to the Sheriff at Glendive
to arrest and bring them back. The
Sheriff caught one (Becker), allowing
two others, whom he did not know, to
get awav. ' But Becker was enough,
and although when brought to the bar
of the Senate he refused to explain or
to take part his vote was counted as
negative, and some important business
was transacted that day. '_' Â¦
Becker was released under surveil
lance and allowed to go to his room.
That was Sunday morning. .Sunday
evening, dressed in overalls and carry
ing a dinner bucket, he made his es
cape by means of a special engine and
crossed the Idaho line. Only two weeks
of the session had passed, and for
the balance of the period of ninety
days nothing was done, and the new
State, with a constitution, was left
without laws. The Democratic Gov
ernor, in face of a Republican Legisla
ture, refused to call a special session.
The contests were settled before the
next winter and the State equipped
with needful legislation. This was
Montana's first whirl at sett-govern
ment. ":
VACANT SEXATORSHIP.
The Senatorial contest had been
carried to . Washington and Sanders
and Powers seated. Sanders had
drawn the short term and his suc

"The gunners, refusing to surren
der, died to a man among their smok
ing guns, and the regiment swept on,
routing the Japanese from behind a
stone wall, whence they fled in con
fusion. Meantime the Third Battalion
surrounded a native .village, which
threatened the rear attacking col
umn. There was a hand-to-hand
fight in the streets before the village
was cleared of Japanese, and the bat
talion surrounded and burned a sec
ond village, taking a number of pris
oners, where there was. again an ex
ampJe of Japanese bravery. An of
ficer, his revolver empty, stood alone,
sword in hand, to receive the rush of
our column and went down fighting.
"Prisoners whom we captured early
In the fight were . kept in * the
trenches, but begged to be sent to the
rear, fearing to be recogmized by
their comrades as having sur
rendered."
"I have just met an officer of the
eastern column, who was with General
Mistchenko during the operation of Oc
tober 13. It seems the Japanese were
harrying his left flank while he was
trying simultaneously to keep in touch
with our eastern and with our central
forces. General Mistchenko appealed
for aid, and a squadron of dragoons
was sent to his support. This squad
ron occupied a hill southwest of Ya
nientun, a village seven miles north
west of Bentslaputze and on the Muk
den road. It turned out that the Jap
anese held a neighboring hill with a
force of infantry concealed In the
woods at the foot of the hill, and so
we sent another squadron to turn the
Japanese position. The country is in
tersected with ravines, and our caval
rymen were forced to go afoot. Cap
tain Sherubovich captured the hill, his
dragoons routing out the Japanese
from the woods at the foot of the hill
and fighting their way to the top. The
Japanese, seeing another squadron as
cending the opposite side, while a rifle
regiment was turning their flank,
feared we had cut them off from the
west road, which was the only line of
retreat they had, and began to retire
in disorder. We caught and cut down
groups as they tried vainly to gain the
western road. The dragoons used their
sabers with deadly effect, both in at
tacking the hill and during the retreat.
Some of the Japanese scorned to give
or take quarter, and died fighting, bay
onets against sabers, in the trenches,
while their companions fled."
In an account of the Russian cap
ture of Lone Tree Hill the correspon
dent says: ..--.-,
"On the night of October 18 the Jap
anese brought their rapid fire guns to
the front and we felt through the dark
ness, though we could scarcely see, a
desperate attack launched against the
whole line- Some say the object was
to retake the fifteen guns that we had
wrested from them, while others are
of the opinion that a general attack
had been planned of which this move
was a mere diversion, the main object
being to recapture the vital position of
Poutiloff, formerly Lone Tree Hill. In
any event the enemy found Kuropatkin
at home and they were not kept long
knocking at his front door.
"The first warning of their coming
was the rattle of quick firing guns con
centrated on the Nineteenth Regiment.
We lay silent while their artillery
thought it was paving the way for the
Japanese attack. Then came the In
fantry and we opened with the favorite
Russian volley firing. It was pitch
black, but as the darkness was lit up
with the glare of our volleys we could
faintly see the shadowy waves of the
enemy's Infantry breaking and sink
ing as they tried to breast our trenches.
The first fierceness of their attack
spent itself. Then came an unaccount
able panic that sometimes grips even
brave men in darkness. They seemed
to think we were advancing to attack,
for they turned and fled in confusion.
Now we have quiet nights. The troops
are resting. Japanese reports of their
victories are baseless.

Rasinger was killed, and the spot in

open and as the outbuilding is a mere
shed, with cracks showing everywhere,
there should have been no difficulty in
hearing the shots, which the husband
protests he did not hear.

shots distinctly.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JAPANESE BATTALION . TAKEN.
How nearly this came to pass is told
In a private letter from an officer par
ticipating in the Liaoyang fight on the
Russian right flank. The letter, how
ever, gives even a . worse picture than
hitherto drawn of the terrible miscar
riage of plans in connection with Or
loff's division. Orloff was directed to
take and hold at all costs a naturally
strong position dominating the Russian
eastern flank. The hill In question was
unoccupied, and Orloff had three regi
ments to throw upon it in abundant
time to head off Kuroki. But, through
a bungling" of directions, the force was
actually lost in the fields of Chinese
corn, and entirely missed Its objective,
meeting the Japanese before either had
occupied the position. Orloff lost many
of his best officers, while his force was
crumpled up and In aimless retreat
through the dense corn fields, when
Stakelberg came to his rescue. Stakel
berg retrieved what otherwise would
have been a disastrous defeat, but the
rescue was too late to give Kuropatkin
MUKDEN. Oct. 15.â There are now
available for the first time two inter
esting technical statements. One Is
General Kuropatkln's order of battle at
Liaoyang, Issued between the evacua
tion of the advanced positions on the
southern front and the desperate Jap
anese assaults on August 30 and 31 on
the main positions around the town.
The other Is a detailed description of
the military defenses of Liaoyang,
Tvrltten by an expert Russian officer on
the ground. This shows clearly that,
though Liaoyang was fortified to the
limit of military engineering skill, Ku
ropatkin had made all preparations in
advance for the withdrawal of the Rus
sian army in case a decisive victory
was not achieved. The statement also
shows that this withdrawal of the com
missariat and supplies had begun early
in July, and it was only the reserve
stock of supplies, which had been re
tained in case of a Russian victory,
that was removed on August 31.
It is also significant that even early
in July the bulk of the supplies that
were removed were transported to Tie
Pass, indicating no intention at that
date of making a decisive stand at
Mukden. It Is made clear that the only
danger threatening the defense of and
withdrawal from J Liaoyang was the
possibility that Japanese, traversing
the hills to the eastward, would make
a descent on the railroad about Yentai.
This was provided against and actually
occurred. It was here, If at all, that
Kuropatkin hoped to catch the Japan

ECHO OF LIAOYANG BATTLE.
A junk which left Liaoti Promontory
yesterday was driven by a gale and ar
rived here to-night, bringing one hun
dred coolies <who left Port Arthur be
cause they feared injury from the Jap
anese shells. These coolies say that
on October 13 there was fierce fighting
for several hours on the slopes of Rih
lung Mountain between comparatively
small forces, during which the Japan
ese lost 300 killed or wounded. The
coolies were unable to give details of
the fighting, but apparently it was the
result of one of the numerous sorties
made by the Rusians against the Jap
anese, r/ho were attempting to ad
vance from their trenches.
A Junk which reached this port to
day from Port Dalny was allowed to
leave only on condition that she take
no coolies, whom the Japanese are
liFinp in large numbers in construct
ing warehouses and removing the dead
and wounded. The wounded are tak
en to the railroad and thence are
transported to Dalny, from which port
they are shipped to Japan. The Jap
anese have practically completed im
mense warehouses between Port Dalny
and Port Arthur and have therein sup
plies sufficient to last them until
spring. Similar preparations have been
made at Newchwang and the Japanese
evpect the release of sixty transports
next month.
CARIXG FOR THE WOUNDED.
Meanwhile the Japanese siege guns
continued to drop big shells into the
harbor, the Japanese claiming that
they damaged the Russian gunboat
Gtllak. which is alleged to have been
hit three times and to have changed
her anchorage from the east basin to
the shelter of Tiger Hill. It is also
believed that the funnel of another
Russian warship was pierced, as a
dense cloud of smoke followed the
landing of a shell on board her.
A Chinese who arrived here to-day
declares that during the Japanese as
sault on Rihlung Mountain the Rus
eian battleships fired almost incessant
ly to the north.
The Japanese at Taku Mountain
have dropped a ceaseless storm of
shell? on the Chinese town, and many
rifle bullets also fell in the place. The
Chinese adds that the fighting was
very severe and that the Japanese
loss was considerable. He says he left
Port Arthur on October IS because he'
was frightened by the shells.
It Is asserted that the Russian force
at Port Arthur row numbers 50,000,
excluding the militia, which is not en
pac'-d in the fighting, but patrols the
streets, doing provost duty and guard
ing the arsenals.
Winter clothing is very scarce at
Port Arthur, shoes particularly. The
Russian soldiers are wearing Chinese
shoes. Some of them are unable to
obtain even these and wrap rags about
their feet. The garrison is greatly
â¢worn out by the many rronths of anx
ious labor and fighting. The town 13
full of wounded. Flour is plentiful,
ar.d the slaughter of horses, mules and
donkeys continues. Chinese who have
reached Chefu from Port Dalny say
that Japanese reinforcements continue
to arrive daily. The Japanese confirm
this.
RUSSIAN" WARSHIPS HIT.
According to Chinese advices which
reached here to-day, and which are
confirmed in essential points by Jap
anese letters from Port Dalny, the Jap
anese made assaults on the remaining
outer works of Rihlung Mountain at
dawn on October 8 and were repulsed.
The following day the Russians made
an attack on the Japanese trenches,
and they, in turn, were repulsed. The
Japanese immediately followed with
another assault, resulting in the cap
ture of an iron railroad bridge and the
heights south of the bridge, which is
only Â£00 yards from the main fortress.
Tho importance of these captures lies
in the fact that they curtail the Rus
sian fire in harassing Japanese who
may attempt to advance on the
trenches located on the slope of Rih
lung: Montain. This attack seems to
have been a surprise for the Russians.
th<> Japanese claiming that they lost
only fifty men. Since the capture of
the prints mentioned, the Japanese as
eert, they successfully resisted numer
ous sorties to recapture them.
At 10 o'clock in the morning of Octo
ber 12 seven Russian torpedo-boat de
stroyers emerged from the harbor of
Port Arthur, and later they were fol
lowed by two more destroyers. This
squadron proceeded to Shaopintau and
bombarded the Japanese left flank.
Four Japanese torpedo-boat destroyers
hurried to the pcene and the Russians
retired to the harbor, followed by the
Japanese. The pursuit ceased upon
entering the mined area. One Japanese
destroyer, while returning, hit a me
chanical mine, and was severely dam
aged, but . c he managed to reach Port
Dalny, and is now being repaired.
The most important recent events at
Port Arthur include the capture by the
Japanese of further minor positions
near Rihlung Mountain, and the severe
damage of a Japanese torpedo-boat de
etroyer by striking a floating mine.
JAPANESE LINES ADVANCE.
CHEFU, Oct. 20.â According to a
camp follower who has been for some
time with the Japanese army now be
sieging Port Arthur and who Is at
present in Chefu, having arrived from
r>alny, the number of Japanese killed
before the forts has reached 50,000. He
Bays the Mikado's men recklessly at
tacked the strongest positions, making
bold rushes in masses the soldiers be
ing stripped of their accouterments and
clothing. The result was that the Rus
sian machine guns mowed them down.
He also asserts that there is some talk
among the officers and men that leads
to the belief that the Japanese mean
to try to carry the inner forts and
citadel this month.
"There has been no change in front
of the center army, except that there
are occasional exchanges of shells.
"It is quiet in front of the left army,
though the enemy occasionally sends
shells UTward our positions. On the
night of October 18 the enemy attacked
the front of the left column, but was
repulsed."
"Yesterday the center column of the
right army attacked and dislodged the
enemy's cavalry holding Tunchiafen,
but a small body of the enemy's in
fantry has returned to that eminence.
The enemy continues to hold Waitao
Mountain.
The Russian forces have been rein
forced by about 30,000 men of the Sev
enteenth Corps, a large portion of the
Tenth Corps and portions of the Fifth
and Sixth Siberian Corps, which re
cently arrived. In all six divisions of
the Russian army now confront the
Japanese left army.
It is announced at headquarters here
that the Japanese left army captured,
near Langtouchleh. six ammunition
carts, 5354 rifles, 4920 rounds of field
gun ammunition, 78,000 rounds of rifle
ammunition and tents, clothing, sabers
and implements.
Manchurian headquarters, telegraph
ing yesterday, reviews the situation at
the front as follows:
TOKIO, Oct. 20.â Reliable reports re
ceived from private sources estimate
the losses of the Japanese left army
(General Oku's) during the recent
battle at about 5000.
* The number of Russian dead is large
ly increased by the further diecovery of
bodies, notwithstanding the nightly re
movals by lantern light.
At 7:30 o'clock this morning the
Russians made a determined counter
attack at Lamuting with two regi
ments of infantry and two batteries of
artillery. They were repulsed after a
half hour's fighting, with heavy loss.
The Japanese left army during the
past seven days' fighting has captured
thirty-four guns, a large number of
rifles and overcoats and 100 prisoners.
The strength of the Russians opposed
to the left army was three corps and
thirty companies of artillery. All but
a very small part were newly, arrived
troops. The Japanese soldiers were
practically the same that fought be
fore Liaoyang.
Chinese report that heavy works are
ready for the Russians along the Hun
River. The Japanese are undecided
where the next stand will be made.
The principal Russian casualties ocÂ»
curred in determined counter attacks
against each village captured by the
Japanese. The Russian attacking par
ties were in many cases entirely an
nihilated. For the first time the Rus
sians have met the Japanese on an
equal footing, not having strong de
fensive positions to depend upon, and
for the first time they attacked the
Japanese in the latter's own trenches.
The Russians everywhere fought
bravely, but they were unable to drive
the JaDanese out or to hold their own
positions against fierce charges. Al
most in every case the Russians re
tired from their positions at the first
charge, then made repeated attempts
to recapture them.
The Japanese left army, with a
front of nearly ten miles, moved for
ward about five miles, fighting over
every inch of ground. The final re
treat of the Russians was almost a
rout this morning. The Japanese ex
treme left advanced, driving the rem
nant of Russians ahead. The Russians
covered their retreat well with artil
lery and carried away much baggage
and manv wounded.'
WITH GENERAL OKU'S LEFT
ARMY, Sunday, Oct. 16.â The seven
days' battle north of Yentai was the
heaviest blow yet struck the Russians
by the Japanese, so far as loss of life
is concerned. The left Japanese army
during the week buried 4100 Russian
dead left in front of its lines. A vil
lage in front of the left wing contains
many Russian dead, but the shell flre
of the retreating Russians prevents
the Japanese reaching them. Con
servative estimates place the Russian
casualties at not less than 25,000.
Probably many more dead are on the
field, in places not yet searched.
The Japanese report their total cas
ualties at a little more than 3000
killed and wounded.

MUKDEN, Oct. 20.â The Japanese are
fond of night attacks, which they or
ganize cleverly. They light a series of
enormous camp fires at false bivouacs
and then stealthily creep upon the
Russian sentinels, who, peering into
the darkness And blinded by the glare,
cannot see the Japanese approaching.
Or they take advantage of a rainstorm
and try to surprise the Russians, on
Tuesday night they adopted both ruses,
but ran into a hornet's nest. The night
was inky black, rain was falling and a
cold wlud was blowing.
"A fine night for the Japanese," every
one said, and the Russians huddled in
the trenches had strict orders that if
the expected but uninvited guests ap
peared they should not fire, but meet
them with the bayonet. It was so dark
that a person could not see his hand
before his face, except vaguely.
Through the rain, in the direction of
the false campflres, all eyes were
strained and ears listened intently. The
wind, which was as cold as ice and cut

already see the silhouettes of the Jap

were not so close.

There was a sudden attack by the
Japanese at 3:25 o'clock yesterday

the Thirty-fifth Rifles, belonging to
General Kondratovlch's division. Col
onel Mustnitsky promptly sent out
three companies to make a counter
attack and the Japanese quickly fell
back, having sustained severe losses.
The Russian casualties were three
killed and eleven wounded. The Jap

were obliged to abandon a gun bearing
the number 363, but before abandoning
the pun the breech block was removed.
The limber contained forty-four rounds
of ammunition. Thanks to the dense

The golden jubilee and graduating
exercises of the Presentation Convent,
Powell street, were celebrated at the
Tivoli Opera-house yesterday after
noon in the presence of the Most Rev.
Archbishop Riordan, priests and sisters
representing the various orders in San
Francisco and vicinity.
The or>era-house was crowded, and
the nature of the exercises was in
beautiful harmony with the occasion.
After an overture, and a vocal solo by
Miss Lillian Beaumont, a drama in six
scenes, entitled "The Pupil's Story of
Fifty Years." was presented. In it were
Known children of the early days ask
ing "California," played by Miss Jo
sephine Taylor, to bring them teach
ers. The scene moved later to Ireland,
where a wealth of pretty lasses, some
in pink and ahamrock-decked frocks
and others In green and gold, gave fair
"California" welcome. One of the most
effective scenes was enacted when the
good nuns, as was the case fifty years
ago, embarked for the Golden West.
The singing and the dancing, the
poetry and the strains of gentle music,
all tended toward a sweet interpreta
tion of the very pretty story.
And after the entertainment came the
very pleasant ceremony of conferring
honors on the graduating class, which
was performed by the Archbishop, who
Â¦was assisted by the Rev. Father T.
Caraher, pastor of St. Francis Church,
and the Rev. Father McGough.
Prior to the presentation Miss Lillian
Beaumont read the following address
to the Archbishop:

Archblshop Riordan. after Investing
the graduates with the honors and giv

happy event, which they had gathered
to celebrateâ the golden jubilee of the

with the graduating exercises. In song
and tableaux they had. celebrated the
great event which was of interest to all

the benefits that had come to the city

The. King, as usual with American
guests, demanded their latest stories
and chatted most informally until near
the end of the luncheon, when he rose
and proposed the health of President
Roosevelt, the American navy and the
officers of the visiting squadron. No
formal reply was made, but Admiral
Jewell told King Edward how much he
appreciated the compliment. The King
chatted with each member of the party,
showed them the palace pictures and
ended the most cordial informal party
by saying lie was always pleased to see
American war vessels in English ports.
LONDON, Oct. 20.â "The American
navy, may its glory never grow less,"
were the words in which King Edward
toasted his naval guests at the lunch
eon at Buckingham Palace to-day.
Embassador Choate first presented
Rear Admiral Jewell, commanding the
European squadron of the North At
lantic fleet, and his staff. Captain Col

were accompanied by Secretary White
and Captain Charles H. Stockton, the
naval attache of the American Em
bassy. Then with an informal "Well,
let's have lunch." the King, wearing
an admiral's uniform, led the way to
the diningÂ»room, where eighteen per
sons sat down, mostly members of the
household. Other guests were Captain
Prince Louis jof Battenberg, Director of
Naval Intelligence; Admiral Lord Wal
ter Kerr, First Lord of the Admiralty,
and Sir Thomas Lipton. Embassador
Choate was on the King's right and
Admiral Jewell on his left.
PEKING. Oct. 20.â The trademark
registration act, which will come into
operation on October 23, is regarded as
unsatisfactory by the commercial com
munities of Shanghai and Tientsin. The
scale of fees is looked upon as being
too elaborate and the fees themselves
too- heavy. If the act go into operation
on the 23d inst., as contemplated, it is
expected that it will give rise to much
confusion and dissatisfaction.
The governments of Great Britain
and the United States approved the
draft of the measure, which was large
ly of Japanese construction, without, it
is alleged, adequately consulting the
mercantile communities which will be
affected by It.
With a view of preventing the en
forcement of an immature and defec
tive scheme, the German Minister,
Baron Mumm von Schwarzenstein.
though cordially welcoming the gsneral
principles of the act. endeavored to ob
tain a postponement of its operation, so
that opportunity might be given for its
reconstruction. Up to this date official
sanction for such postponement has
not been obtained, but it was learned
to-day that the British Minister. Sir
E. M. Satow, has been instructed to
endeavor to have the operation of the
act deferred.
Philip Prior, principal of the James
Lick School, requested that the name
of the school be changed to the Bur
nett Grammar School and the name of
the present Burnett School to Bay View
School If any change is made at all.
A communication from Superinten
dent Langdon, who is now engaged in
a tour of inspection of the Chicago
schools, has been received by Acting
Superintendent Macurda, in which he
states that the San Francisco educa
tional exhibit at St. Louis has received
two gold medals, one for the display of
work from the elementary schools, the
other for the exhibit of the high
schools. Much favorable comment for
the San Francisco exhibit has been
elicited from educators.
Teachers' certificates of various kinds
were granted to Misses H. M. Hitch

In Englehart's room were found ten

legal riirht to expend -money for purchase of

The balloting opened with Frank in
the lead, but he never, came within five
of the goal. After midnight the Re
publicans declined to vote,: holding that
the session had expired of limitation,
After passing . several ballots : an Inde
pendent Democrat unexpectedly voted
for Carter. . Instantly .'there [was great
enthusiasm on the Republican side, and
they came in again " in * a ' body. But
there were not enough. At 3 o'cldck In
the morning, after motions to adjourn
had been, repeatedly defeated but
decreasing majority, Maginnis suggest
ed to Frank that thev draw straws " to
decide before the whole assembly. which
should goto the United States Senate.
Frank declined, saying his friends had
supported him voluntarily, he could not
make such a deal for such an office
and ended by proposing, that on the
next ballot his friends. should .vote 'for
Paris Gibson. When the ;roll was
called no one suspected? that. Gibson
was elected: The announcement,/how
ever, was greeted with a cheer,- and the
building was quickly, emptied'of a' very
tired and befuddled Legislature. : .
Gibson had been attending the session
for a few, days,* and there had been at
tempts to stampede on r his s. name . be
fore; but they failed.^. He had gone to
his hotel,' and - was sound asleep when
a' friend 1 roused him to-tell;hlm he was
a ' United States Senator.
Paris Gibson, founder of Great
Falls, was elected at the same session.
H. L. Frank of Butte, a millionaire
miner; W. G. Conrad of Great Falls,
a banker, and .Walter Cooper of, Boze
man, a mining man, were the princi
pal candidates. Gibson was a . dark
horse all : through: The Labor party,'

On the last day they met ln joint ses
sion and as they convened the Lieuten
ant Governor instructed the sergeant at
arms to stop the clock. The clock was
on â¢ the Republican side, on the wall.
Nathan Godfrey, an athletic cattleman,
six feet tall started the light, and when
It looked as though every man was en
gaged a Democrat hurled an ink bottle,
which lodged In the works of the clock,
and the business of the session was
presently resumed. The ,hall was with
out ventilation, had a low ceiling, was
packed to suffocation and the only,
means of Ingress or egress waa through
a window.
GIBSON FINALLY CHOSEN.
In the meantime the Amalgamated
Copper Company had been formed,
with Daly ln it, and the campaign,
aside from vindication, took on an
anti-corporation phase, which made
Helnze a powerful ally of Clark in this
fight. The Daly element lost control
of the Democratic party, which passed
over to Clark, and an Independent
Democratic party was organized. Clark
and Heinze' then began this trick of
organizing the Populist and Labor
parties, which they fused with the
regular Democratic party, and carried'
the State with an overwhelming ma
jority, capturing all the State offices
and both branches of the Legislature.
Soon after the election, however,
Heinze turned away from Clark, tried
to get control of the Legislature and
to hold up the election of Clark by
keeping members of the Labor party
in the Legislature out of the caucus.
He failed, however. Between the elec
tion and the assembling of the Legisla
ture Marcus Daly died. The old per
sonal following of Daly accepted the
leadership of Clark as head of the
regular Democratic party. He was
elected Senator in 1901 for the long
term, . succeeding Carter.
STRENUOUS SESSION.
the seat. Clark returned and immedi
ately organized for a campaign of vin
dication. Clark had not stumped the
State since he ran for Congress in 1888.
He had been now widely advertised. He
made a complete tour of the State and
was a great card. People traveled long
distances to see and hear him, and he
made a hit with them.

.Plans were quickly formed for fight
ing the fire. Every citizen turned out
and was soon hard at work battling
with the flames. For some time no
visible progress was made ln the efforts
to stamp out the fire, and it seemed as
though the flying sparks would ignite
Foster's hotel and the depot. Another
source of danger to the town was the
fact that more than a ton and a half
of dynamite was stored in the powder
house near the town.
The dynamite was being used for
blasting purposes in the quarry near by.
The fight was kept up until the flames
were within 200 feet of the town, wlien
the wind fortunately shifted and the
danger was averted. '
SAN DIEGO, Oct. 20. â Mountain
fires have filled the air with smoke for
the past two days. Tonight there are
fires upon the mountains ia several di
rections, and considerable anxiety is
felt by those who have friends or rela
tives living ln the timber or brush re
gions.
For a time this morning the citizens
of Foster, a town at the end of the
Cuyamaca Railroad, were forced to
abandon everything and form them
selves Into a fire fighting brigade to
combat fires which threatened the de
struction of the town. A strong east
wind carried the "fire, which had been
burning upon the east side of the
mountain, over the top toward the
town. No danger was anticipated until
shortly after daylight, when the fire
had approached to within half a mile
of the place.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The whole town was in an uproar
until daylight, further rioting and
arson being feared.
The second soldier shot in the affray.
Private Moore of Company K, Fif
teenth Infantry, cannot live through
the night. A third soldier was shot
through the wrist. A colored trooper
named Allen, a member of the First
Squadron of the Ninth Cavalry, is one
of the men who did the shooting.
Deputy Sheriff Davis arrested Allen
and three other negro cavalrymen in
the hills on their way south. They are
now In the guardhouse at Monterey
Presidio. A double guard has been
stationed over the suspects, as it is
feared an attempt will be made by the
white soldiers to lynch them before
rrorning.
Shortly after 11 o'clock several mem
bers of the Ninth Cavalry (colored) at
tempted to force their way into a no
torious resort known as "The Adobe."
Members of the Fourth Cavalry and
Fifth Infantry who were in the place
resented the Intrusion of the colored
men and a fierce fight followed. The
men quarreled for some time, and a
large crowd of both white and colored
soldiers gathered in the street in front
of the resort. The efforts of the guard
to subdue the rioters failed. Finally
three negroes left the house and de
liberately fired Into the crowd. One
ehot killed Sergeant Tooley of the
Fourth Cavalry and a second fatally
Injured another member of the same
regiment. Other shots were fired, but
fortunately no one else was hit.
Members of the Fourth Cavalry be
came so incensed over the killing of
their comrade that it is alleged they
set the house afire. The flames spread
to the adjoining house and both were
destroyed, the Inmates barely escaping
with their lives.
MONTEREY. Oct. 20. â Early last
evening about 250 members of the
Fourth Cavalry, which Is to relieve the
Ninth Cavalry stationed here, arrived
by train. Citizens present at the depot
stated that some of the men were under
the Influence of Hauor when they got
off the cars. The new arrivals were
riven a supper and reception which
added to their hilarity. The soldiers
thronged the streets all the evening
and engaged in frequent rows, and
three guards were detailed to arrest
the offenders.

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, bat Safe and
Effectual Cure for It. j
Catarrh of the ftomach has long been
considered the next thing to incurable.
The usual symptoms are a full or bloat-
ing sensation after eating:, accompanied |
sometimes with sour or watery risings,
a formation of gases, causing pressure
on the heart and lungs and difficult j
breathing, headaches, fickle appetite,
nervousness and a general played out,
languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the i
mouth, coated tongue and if the interior !
of the stomach could be seen it would Â¦
enow a slimy, inflamed condition. :
The cure for this common and ob-
Etlnate trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and irritate the. delicate
mucous surfaces xif the stomach. To
secure a prompt and healthy digestion'
is the one necessary thing to do and
when normal digestion is secured the
catarrhal condition will have disap-
peared.
According to Dr. Harlanson the saf-
est and best treatment is to use -after
each meal a tablet composed of Dias-
tase, Aseptic Pepsin, a little Xux/Gold-
en Seal and fruit adds. These tablets
can now be found at all drug stores
under the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, and not being a patent medi-
cine can be used with perfect safety
and assurance that healthy appetite
and thorough digestion will follow. their
regular use after meals.
Mr. R. S. Workman. Chicago, 111.,
writes: "Catarrh is a local condition
resulting from a neglected cold- In the
head, whereby the lining membrane
of the nose becomes inflamed and the
poisonous discharge therefrom passing
backward into the throat reaches the
stomach, this producing catarrh of the
Etomach. Medical authorities prescrib-
ed Jot me for three years for catarrh
of stomach without cure, but , to-day
I am the happiest of men after using
only one box of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets. I cannot find appropriate
Â¦words to express my good feeling. , I
have found flesh, appetite and sound
rest from their use."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the saf-
est preparation as well as the simplest
and most convenient remedy r for any
form Â¦ of indigestion. Catarrh of stom-
ach, biliousness, sour stomach,' heart-
burn and bloating after meals.

While Edna Wallace Hopper, the
actress, would give up the magnificent
collection of books left by her mother,
the late Josephine Dunsmuir, to satis
fy the demands of the publishing, firm
of E. Holdaway & Co., which is now
suing for the payment of $30,000
worth delivered, she is ' opposed by
the young son of Mountford Wilson of
the firm of Wilson ."& Wilson, in San
Francisco, who was left the books by
Airs. Dunsmuir, and Publisher Hold
away finds that he can neither get
books nor money.
Edna Hopper thinks more of horses
than of books and wants to let the
publisher have them back. Young
Wilson wants the books and wants the
ej? rate' to pay the money, now due on
them, so that he can get his legacy
clear. Between these stands Executor
Charles H. Lovell, who finds himself
in an awkward position. As a mem
ber of the firm of Wilson & Wilson
he would like to - oblige young Wil
son. But as executor of the estate
he " also wants to please Mrs. Hop
per. Between these claimants the
matter is tightly drawn. , ?.'
In speaking for the publisher's end
of the three-cornered ' fight Attorney
Stanley Moore said to-day: "My client
is the worst rattled man in the case.
He scratches his head arid does not
know where he is. -.He is willing to
take the books, but they won't*- give
them up. He is willing to take the
money and they will not pay him."
These books cannot be duplicated and
hv had great difficulty in filling the or
ders. But there Is a fight within a
fight which we are called upon to
combat."

ALAMEDA, Oct. 20.â Human bones,
unearthed from Â¦ the bottom -of the es-,
tuary. this morning, clogged the pipe
of the dredger at work" off the Alameda
Boating Club's house and stopped the
big machine until 7 - the obstruction could
be removed. NeaVly all of the skeleton
was found jn the pipe and at the out
let, but it had been badly rent in going
through the suction pump. There was
no trace of Jflesh on the bones,' and
they show evidence of : having . been in
the water for.- a long time.
Louis Sansdm, who was in charge of
the night 'shift; on the dredger, made
the grewaome discovery at 5:30 o'clock
thts morning. â¢ He- observed that the
water and ' slickena .; were not â¢ flowing
through the pipe at a certain point as
freely as they. Should/ WithPeter Lar
sen, Charles . Olsen and - Eric Isaacson
he made an, examination of the pipe
and discovered the skeleton. The bones
are large;! and; it is believed that; they
are "those* of a ; man.-' - ." ' V\
The bones were 'taken to the : local
Branch Morgue * to await r word from
Coroner H. <B. Mehrmann as to what
disposition shall be made of them.. .

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 20.â R. J.
Laws, superintendent of the Sacra
mento division of the Southern Pa
cific Company, who died so suddenly
this morning at the scene of the
wreck at Yuba Pass, began service
with the railroad company July 14,
1S6S. He was first employed as rod
man in the engineering department
and later as assistant to the resident
engineer. In 1876 he was appointed
roadmaster on the Sacramento di
vision with headquarters at Blue Can
yon, within a few miles of the station
where he passed away. After two
years he was transferred to the posi
tion of roadmaster in charge of the
lines .between Sacramento and Oak
land.
In the spring of 1880. through the
recommendation of A. N. Towne and
J. A. Fillmore. Laws took the posi
tion of superintendent of the con
struction of the Carson and Colorado
Railroad, In Nevada, and in 1S82 he
became assistant superintendent of
the line. After the line was complet
ed he continued in the service of the
company as assistant superintendent
and chief engineer until April. 1902,
when he was transferred to Sacramen
to to take the position of division su
perintendent, which he filled until his
death. Laws was a prominent Knight
Templar. He was a man of sterling
character and was well liked by all
who knew him. . He always dealt
fairly with the men and commanded
their respect. He was 57 years of age.

It is said, too, that the Sterling
company has turned its assets over to
the United States Bonding Company
and is destroying evidence of the
transfer. Judgment is asked for $15,

accounting: is demanded and an In
junction restraining the company
from disposing of its assets is prayed
for. ; : -'<r*6;j Â¦
Another batch of victims of a get
rich-quick scheme have come to the
Superior Court for relief. A suit was
begun yesterday against J. C Watson
and W. A. C. Smith doing business as
the Sterling Securities Company by
A. C. Hicks, Estelle F. Hicks and four
ether holders of "merchandise con
tracts" promising to pay two dollars
for one. The complainants allege
that the business is illegal and
conducted for the purpose of defraud
ing the contract holders. They say
that more than 500 contracts have
been sold and more than $15,000 paid
in to the concern, and of this sum it
is said more than $6000 has been con
verted, withdrawn and misappropri
ated.

BLOOMINGTON, I1L, Oct. 20. â A
sensation was created here this after
noon when Matthew R. Cunningham,
Countj- Recorder, committed suicide
by shooting himself through the head.
It had been known for some time that
the accounts of the Recorder were in
a tangled condition and the Grand
Jury finally took action, as did the
Board of Supervisors also.
A committee of the latter was ap
pointed and made an examination cf
the accounts, finding that he was
about 5500 short, which his bonds
men agreed to make good. The bonds
man had an appointment to meet him
this afternoon for a settlement, but,
dreading the possible outcome of this
conference, he killed himself.
The*t of Only Five Hundred Dollars
Leads to a Tragedy In
Illinois.
When Charles Gustavus Adams, at
torney at law and formerly an Epis
copal clergyman, turned on the gas
last Tuesday night in his room at 118
Eddy street, he ended by a tragedy a
life that had been full of tragedies. On
June 17, 1901, Adams, then a clergy
man, residing in Berkeley, shot and
killed J. T. Jessup, a dentist. Adams
was laboring under a fit of delirium
tremeris and was beating his daughter.
She telephoned for Jessup to come and '>
save her, and when the dentist ap- {
pcared on the stairway the frenzied
minister shot him, inflicting a mortal
wound. Adams was acquitted on the
ground of insanity and was commit
ted to the hospital for the insane at j
Agnews, whence he was discharged as j
cured about two years ago.
Adams has since lived in this city
arid practiced law, his office at the
time of his death being in the Colum
bian building, 916 Market street. His
suicide was due to despondency,

woman named Maud Ellson, formerly

had been keeping company for about
a month. The girl left him last Tues
day, and residents of the house In

Adams said to her: "Maud, if you
won't come back to me, I'll commit
suicide." t iÂ» ~
Between 9 and 10 o'clock last Tues
day night, the landlady, Mrs. S. C.
Madden, smelled gas escaping from his |
room. She entered and asked Adams,
who was in bed, why he had turned
on the gas, and he denied the fact or I
that the gas was escaping. The burner '
was open at the time and the fluid was j
pouring from it. Mrs. Madden closed j
the key and warned him to be more j
careful. Then she opened the win- 1
dow and left the room. j
In the morning the windows were
closed, the gas valve was open and j
Adams lay dead on his bed fully j
dressed with the exception of his over- j

At the annual convention of the Cali- 1
fornia Miners' Association in 1903 the j
anti-debris men met on the floor of the"
convention with the members of the Â¦
association, and a somewhat spirited :
episode was the result. Since then t
the California gold-dredger miners !
have made up a report relative to j
operations in the dredger' fields in thi?
river bottoms. Within the last month |
threats have been made by the anti- â¢
debris men to enjolp the ODerations of i
certain mines. Altogether the time is Â¦
ripe for a systematic study of all the
problems relating to erosion and to j
mining debris, and great interest id
sure to center In the discussion for |
which the California miners have ar- i
ranged. '
The executive committee of the Min- !
ers' Association has decided to hold !
the annual convention in the white din- j
ing-room of -the Hotel St. Francis on!
December 5. 6, 7. 8 and possibly on the
9th also. Business sessions will take |
place only In the forenoons, the after
noons being reserved for excursions.
Trips will be made to the Selby Smelt
ing Works. thc>Union and Risdon iron
works, using the Union Iron Works'
tug for the purpose; to Mare Island by
steamer Slocum; to the Pacific Steel
and Wire Company's plant, the Cali
fornia Powder Works, and to other
places of interest. Before the assem
bling of the convention a programme
will be sent out and the delegates. will
have a chance to make selections of the
places that they desire to visit.
Mr. Benjamin, secretary of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association, has made
early application to persons who. have
been requested to -prepare papers for
the convention, and has asked them to
get their communications in as soon as
possible, to the end that all may be
: printed in time ', to be distributed in |
i pamphlet , form at the convention, so i
; that the : discussion : resulting may all
! be from an Intelligent point of view.
! Judge E/A. Belcher will prepare a pa
; per on "Mineral Land Laws." Acorn
j mittee is about to report to Congress
concerning such laws, and the topic
is, therefore, of .more than ordinary. In
terest.' Among* the papers to be pre
sented for consideration are the fol
lowing: â¢?.

Taking advantage of expert opinion
that will be furnished by practical en
gineers, the California Miners' Associa
tion, at the coming annual meeting,
will consider the miplng-debris ques
tion in a large way. The discussion will
undoubtedly begin with the reading of
a paper that has been provided for.
which will have the title of "Natural
Erosion Compared With Mining Opera
tions." This will lead to accurate esti
mates and much light will undoubtedly
be thrown upon a problem that has
caused more discussion than any other
in California.

TRUCKEE, Oct. 20.â R. J. Laws, su
perintendent of the Sacramento divi
sion, fell dead, presumably from heart
disease, at Yuba Pass this morning.
His private car was attached to No. 3,
the westbound overland, when the train
crashed into the rear end of freight
train No. 115. The caboose of the freight
train was demolished, several freight
cars were crushed, portions of the
snowshed timbers knocked down
and the head engine of the passenger
was badly injured. Fire broke out al
most instantly, and the flames from
the wreckage speedily caught in the
shed timbers.
Four carload3 of cattle were, burned.
The car doors were opened, but the cat
tle would not escape and slowry burned
to death. None of the passengers was
serio*usly injured, but all were badly
shaken ur. and the confusion and ex
citement was indescribable. Superin
tendent Laws was stricken down al
most immediately after the accident.
The passenger train was backed up to
Cisco, where it is at present, the body
of Superintendent Laws resting in his
private car. . .
The forward portion of the freight
train escaped from the burning sheds,
and fire trains were soon battling with
the flames, but a mile of snowsheds
was consumed.
A snowshed outfit or wrecking train
together with the station at Yuba Pass
and all the telegraph poles and lines
were totally destroyed. Large forces
of (workmen are engaged in clearing
away the burning timbers and laying
new track, but it will be near midnight
before trains can pass.
The passengers that were traveling
in the two coaches that were destroyed
jumped from the train in time to save
their lives, although many of. them
were given a hard shaking up when
the two trains came together and re
ceived slight injuries, such as bumps
and bruises.
It is eaid that none of the baggage
belonging to the tourists was saved and
most of them will arrive in this State
with a scant supply of clothing.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon twenty
freight cars of train No. 218 plunged off
a bridge between Marmol and Calvade
into the Truckee River. It is claimed
that no one was, hurt. The bridge is
seriously .Injured and a wrecking train
and bridge crew ; from" Cisco, after
working at the Yuba Pass wreck all
day, sped through Truckee at 7 o'clock
to-night to try to repair the bridge.

LOS ANGELES. Oct. .20.â Judge
Wellborn, in the United States Circuit
Court this morning rendered his de
cision in* the fruit routing: case,- deny-*
ing the* application- for .'a stay of exe
cution asked for by the railroad: upon
the former decision of the court, which
decision denied right of the railroads
to arbitrarily route shipments of fruit
at the initial shipping* point. The at
torneys for the railroads gave notice |
of appeal from the latest decision both
to the Circuit , Court of Appeals and
the Ignited States Supreme Court-
Judge Wellborn announced that he
had been unable to file a written opin
ion. A synopsis of his oral opinion
follows: -
The doctrine of comparative hardships should
be applied to the case. To justify the suspen
sion of the decree It must be shown, tlrst,
that Irremediable damage will result to thr
defendants by its enforcement, and, second,
that no such toes will result to the complain
ant, and by this ia meant, not the Interstate
Commerce Commission, but thÂ« general public,
or, more especially, the citrus fruit shippers.
It may be conceded that the defendants will
sustain damages by the enforcement of the
decree, for which there is no adequate recom- |
IT!', but the nature and. amount of which is i
not ascertalnable. . Â¦ â¢ .f
As against this phase. or the case the prop- [
oslticn arises, will the complainant sustain !
damages by reason of the suspension of the '
decree? In what condition will the suspension
of the decree leave the shippers? -The decree i
restores to them the routing privilege; . the
suspension will take it from thÂ«m and thereby
utterly destroy competition, both as to service
and rates.
As to the value of this privilege it is only
necessary to refer to the testimony of Bisse'.l i
and others. That it is of ere&t value is evt
' denced by the efforts that have been made to
retain it. as shown by this litigation, and the
j statements that have been made that the rall
1 roads expect to transport 25,000 or 30,000 cars
Â¦ of citrus fruits this year.
Rebates are a violation' of the interstate act
i so flagrant that it is difficult to find language
! sufficiently strong and ' blistering to chaxacter-
I lze it. While the' matter has not been treat
ed directly In ths case at .bar, I am convinced
the Joint tariff Is 'a violation of that act. and
for that reason I cannot entertain favorably
the motion if the obvious I intention was to
! violate some other law than the interstate act.
> It follows from the views expressed that tha
i motion, for a -stay of the decree is denied. The
temporary stays are terminated.
Miliiken at once filed notices of ap- i
peal to the 'Circuit Court of Appeals!
of the; Ninth District. and also to the!
Supreme Court of the United States, !
and asked that the court. In fixing the
bond for costs, also fix the amount to
cover damages, so that It could act as
supersedeas.
"I; will not approve a bond that
would- have the effect of nullifying my
action," said the Judge.

'""pHE harried Czar, who reads day by day the tale, of wrecked
I armies and perishing hopes in the Far East, now finds his at
tention sharply divided by the gloomy reports of his home po
lice. From Finland comes the story of a sudden boldness of action
on the part of the secret patriotic societies ; Poland reports the
open defiance of the separatists ; even the downtrodden Jews are
credited with a general of unrest. The thought must
inevitably break in upon the Czar, as it has already struck the minds
of Old World diplomatists: if Russia lose, what then?'
Besides the lost prestige in the. family of nations and the
weight of national shame which must be borne by this autocrat of
all empires, the immediate effects of a defeat would < strike in upon
the very vitals of the Russian state with a force almost impossible
lo estimate. Of the manifold disasters resulting from a decisive
trouncing at the hands of Japan, two would be of immediate effect
and far-reaching influence. Their potency would doubtless shake
Russia to its foundations.
The first of these, and one which seems to be giving premonitorv
warnings of its possible strength even now> would be the blow
struck directly at the integrity of the empire. Russia is the great
est assimilator of all the nations. There are races recently conquered
which arc still in process of governmental digestion! -The Finns,
the Poles, Circassians, Armenians, the peoples. of Central .Asiaâ
these arc the elements of Russian dominion yet raw arid untJrbken,
whose spirit of nationality is curbed only, not crushed. How would
these peoples receive the abasement of Russian arms, that visible
sign of their subjection? Maybe this question even now finds place
in the councils of Nicholas, . .*. .

Brave,
I march where the heroes are;
On my breast I feel a scar.
I turn to gaze on the rayless night.
The gloom is cleft by a beacon light.
And beholdâ the bivouac star!
â Lulu Whedon Mitchell. In the October
Century.
I have read so long in the Book of the
Brave,
Their nags go streaming by,
Sharp comes the sentry's cry:
The shaded light of my study lamp
Seems a low glimmer from some still
camp, '
Where the sleeping soldiers lie.
I have read so long in the Book of ttta
Brave,
I hear the tramp of their feet
In the quiet village street.
I catch the sound of an echoing cheer.
Blown down the night wind, faintly
clear.
And the drum's unfaltering beat.
Many gowns are trimmed with vel
vet bands headed with a little gold
cording. And each band is treated a
little differently from the one above it.
The gold braid is put on straight, or in
swirls, or in scollops, or in a conven
tional Grecian key design. This gives
the gown a handsome appearance.

interesting"account of the value of su

ill health. In some experiments he
carried out he found that by giving
from 1% to 10 ounces per day to ema
ciated people a gain in weight averag
ing 3V& ounces per day was the re
sult, some of the patients even gain
ing over one pound each day. From
his observations Dr. Toulouse found
that the sugar was most beneficial
when given in conjunction with a milk

The heavy canvas yoke is quite a
pretty feature of early fall. It Is
made of cream colored canvas cut in
little scallops around the edge, for it
is an overhanging yoke finished like a
cape collar. The little scallops are
bound with silk, and each is worked
with a little flower. A big scallop of
the canvas hangs over each shoulQer
like an epaulette. This style can be
recommended to any one who is mak

A SPECIAL committee of the California Water and Forest As
sociation, after careful deliberation and with the counsel of
representatives of the United States Bureau of Forestry, has
reported back outlines for a bill directed to the protection from fire
of California forests. Under the provisions of this measure, which
is to be urged upon the next Legislature for enactment, a State
Forester, appointed by the Governor and serving during good be
havior, is to have supervision over deputy fire wardens constituting
a permanent fire fighting force. The establishment of the depart
ment and its maintenance, as projected by the association's commit
tee, will cost the State not over $30,000 annually.
This protective measure of the California Water and Forest As
sociation is a worthy cause and one well worth thorough exploitation. 1
During the past three months three-quarters of a million acres of
the State's finest timber land have been swept by devastating fires
and thousands of dollars' worth of property licked up in smoke. Be
sides the valuable timber ranges in various sections of the Sierra
and Coast ranges that have suffered from forest fires, the beautiful
trees of the Big Basin, saved from the woodman's ax only, by the
devoted efforts of a society of nature lovers, have been Seared by
the flames, and many of them destroyed. It is time that permanent
provision against the loss of our forests be made.
It is sincerely to be hoped that when the Legislature takes
action upon the suggestion that is to come before it the tenure of
office of the State Forester will be made in accordance with the
recommendation of the association's committee. If we are to have
an efficient official to look after the interests of our forests his office
must not be open to the chances of political patronage and subject
to continual change in its incumbency. A trained man kept per
manently at the head of affairs can pursue a successful policy; one
whose tenure of office is subject to the fluctuations of the political
tide can accomplish very little.

FOR EVENING.
How can mothers be so blind to the
mental effect of punishment under
either of these conditions?
Think of it for a moment! What is
the effect of a whipping? Can you re
member how you felt under the lash or
the slipper?
Oh, mothers who punish children to
make them sit pleasant before the
camera, look back thirty years! What
would you have felt as a child had you
been punished to "make you look pleas
ant"? Nor is it necessary to go back
to childhood to reason out the effect of
such punishment.
Let us suppose that to-night you are
sleepless and that some one who con
sidered herself privileged should whip
you to make you sleep.
A strange way to quiet even a grown
woman, you would think. Of course the
child sleeps after punishment. He
cries himself weary and from sheer ex
haustion falls to sleep. It is supposed,
however, that the afternoon nap is
given for the good of the child. It is
more injury than good when the de
sire to sleep must be induced by such
heroic method as a whipping.
To face a camera is an ordeal trying
enough to a grown person. How, then,
can a child be blamed for fussing be
fore the machine? asks a writer in the
Pittsburg Press. That some mothers
expect a child to show more patience
and more bravery and less self-con
sciousness than they could show is evi
dent from the following: _
In a studio, before a camera, sat a
three-year-old child: She had not been
angelic; no amount of prejudice toward
the child could make any one think
that. -But when the little one wept, the
mother shook it, boxed it and spanked
it to make it sit up and look pleasant.
Another mother, who was a firm be
liever in the "rest cure." put her five
year-old boy to sleep every afternoon.
Every day he rebelled. Every day he
was spanked emphatically to produce
the desired "sleepy" condition of mind.

PUNISHMENTOFCHILDREN
FOR THE TABLE.
"The nurses told me that the chil
dren found great delight in watching
the butterflies float about from one
bunch of flowers to another."
"As I stood holding a big bunch of
sweet peas a very gorgeous butterfly
came hovering near it. I got so much
pleasure watching him that it sudden
ly flashed into my mind that the sick
children would like to watch him, too.
So I caught him carefully, so as not
to hurt his wings, and went indoors for
a box to put him in. I realized that
a whole ward of children could not
watch one butterfly, so I caught a lot
of them.
Many people have sent flowers from
their summer gardens to the sick in the
hospitals, but perhaps only one person
has had the idea of sending a box of
butterflies along with the flowers- The
woman who had the idea tells enthusi
astically of how it came to her.
"I was gathering flowers for my hos
pital box on a day when my garden
seemed to be filled with butterflies. As
I picked the flowers I often stopped
in my work to watch them.
"Pieces of blotting paper should
be thoroughly saturated with the per
fume and placed among lingerie or
handkerchiefs, so that the free use
of the extract will be unnecessary, and
the effect something much more de
lightful.
' "Another mode of producing a
sweet fragrance about the person Is
what is called a violet sponging. It
may sound extravagant, but as a
matter of fact it is quite economical.
When all the pores have been opened
by a thorough rubbing then comes
the violet sponging. To a basin of
tepid water a generous supply of
\iolet extract is added. A velvet
sponge, dipped into the water, is then
passed quickly over the surface of the
body, and as a result a flowery frag
rance is left behind."
"Perfume of any sort should never
be used profusely. There should be
only a suspicion of the -odor clinging
about the garments, and this is only
obtained by the use of sachets
placed in the closets where gowns
are hung or places where under
clothes are kept. Perfumed flannel,
which can be purchased in pieces to
suit the customer, should be tacked
within dress linings or made up with
the different costumes.
"So many women ask me what is
that indescribably dainty odor which
others of their sex shed around them
nowadays. It's not a positive per
fume, only Just the most refined
sweetness imaginable. It is violet,
simply violet, but violet in every
thing, perfume, sachets, perfumed
flannels for tacking in dress linings,
tooth wash, hair tonics, bath tablets,
everything." says a writer in the,Xew
York Telegram.
This is the recipe given by a drug
gist for the woman who would be not
only as fair as the rose, but radiate an
odor equally as sweet. And in spite of
the fad for stronger and more pow
erful perfumes, he asserts that women
of refinement still use nothing but
violet.
"But perfume alone won't yield this
delightful but evanescent fragrance,"
he continued. "A woman must take
violet for her hygienic text and live
up to it faithfully if she would be
able to create that mysterious and de
lightful atmosphere of rare flowers
about her.
VIOLET JN EVERYTHING.
BUTTERFLIES FOR SICK.
Just now the whole country is hearing the arguments made in
behalf of District Attorney Folk of St. Louis, who is running as a
candidate for Governor of Missouri. As a prosecuting officer in the
courts of Missouri. Mr. Folk has done his duty under circumstances
of difficulty and danger. He has detected, pursued and punished
public wrongdoers, and inen who sought office to enrich themselves
with bribes, paid for selling public power and authority to enemies
of the public interest. In performing tins duty Mr. Folk prosecuted
the Lieutenant Governor of the State, members of the Legislature
and of the City Council of St. Louis. Many whom he pushed to
conviction were members "of .. his own party, and all of its machinery
of threat and persuasion was put in action to induce him to desist.
In some phases of his work he consulted President Roosevelt, and
had his ad\ice and support, though they are of opposite parties.
Honesty has no politics, nor has dishonesty.. They inhere in
the character and personality of men. Xow that Mr. Folk is a can
didate for Governor the argument is well made in his behalf that a
public servant who has dutifully wrought as he has should be re
wsrded by the people, not so much because he deserves it, but to
encourage others in public life to mind their official oath. and do their
duty. It would belittle Mr. Folk to say that he had his eye on the
effect of his course upon his future political preferment, for there
is no indication that such was the case. But now that such pre
ferment may be given him, it becomes a vastly important public
interest that the people give it to him, to encourage fidelity in others.
When this principle is applied to a candidate for a political
office like that of Governor, how much more necessary is its ap
plication to the judicial office. There are certain evils attendant upon
our elective judiciary, but these will disappear when the people, ir
respective of partisanship, make it plain that honorable judges are
as sure of their places during life, or good behavior, as they would
be if appointed to a life, tenure.
If ever four judges have merited that expression of confidence
Murasky, Troutt, Sea well and Kerrigan have. . In the vexatious liti
gation characteristic of this cosmopolitan city they have held the
scales of justice in even adjustment, and have. administered the law
without fear or favor. They have enforced the excellent and worthy
saying of President Roosevelt that no man is above the law and no
man is below it. It is for all, and they have embossed upon the
dockets of their courts that principle of equality before the law that
is vital to the existence of a free society. San Francisco needs and
can have a model local judiciary by applying to selections for the
bench the same policy that brings to Mr. Folk the support of the
State of Missouri. Encourage fidelity in others by recognizing men
who have been faithful.
Some may say it is an officer's duty to do his duty, because it
is his duty, and without expectation or hope of other reward than
the approval of his conscience. That is perfectly true. But what
will be the effect of refusal on the part of the people to recognize
the fact that he has done his duty? It means the progressive dete
rioration of morals in public life, for it puts the faithful and the un
faithful on the same plane.
We are gratified at the awakened appreciation shown by San
Francisco. It is expressed by organized bodies, and is confirmed by
the spirit shown at public meetings and by nearly all of the press
of the city, favoring the re-election of the four judicial officers
whose official course and private characters are above reproach.
Their election ends partisanship in the selection of the judiciary
ond opens a vast and inviting field to the upright members of the
legal profession, who may expect public indorsement without being
compelled to seek it by the arts of the partisan.
IT is -an encouraging sign of corning non-partisanship in the ju
dicisry of this city that the four incumbents of the bench up for
re-election, though nominally belonging to different political par- Â¦
lies, arc .supported by voters of ail parties. Judges -Scawell, Troutt, j
Kerrigan'and Murasfcy have been efficiently tried in the judicial office j
nnd found wonhv. !

The new store of* the Gildea Com
pany is one of the finest of its kind in
the city. In it is embodied everything
that goes to make up a clothing estab
lishment of the highest order. Nothing
has been left undone to equip the
establishment in the most complete
manner, and the people of San Fran
cisco will find it an ideal store to
shop in.
The firm occupies the entire new
building of four floors and basement.
It is thoroughly lighted and aired, and
every modern convenience known' to
up-to-date builders has been Installed
in this spacious establishment.
The new firm will begin its career to
day with the determination of operat
ing a high-class establishment that
will be second to none in this city.
Though none but the highest grade
goods will be kept in stock, the prices
are to bÂ« moderate â from 2f.-to 40 per
cent lower than prevail in the or
dinary establishments of the city.
All the stock of the new store will bÂ«
manufactured especially for the J. J.
Gildea Company by the best known
and most reliable makers of hlgn
grade goods- in the country. Besides
the regular line of goods carried, the
new firm will be agents for W. S. Peck
<& Co., famous makers of men's cloth
ing, and for Alfred Benjamin and
Northrop & Co., leading manufactur
ers of juvenile clothing in the United
States. The names of these three
firms is enough to convince any man
that when he buys their goods he is
getting the very best that ia put upon
the market in any country*
The first floor of the new building
will be devoted to men's clothing, hats
and furnishing goods. On the second
floor will be found nothing out juvenile
goods. A special line of men's fine
clothing and overcoats will be on dis
play on the third floor. The fourth
floor will be reserved for a fine line of
trunks, dress-suit cases, traveling
bags and everything needed by the
traveler.
The officers of the firm" were highly
elated over the success of opening day.
Everything went along smoothly, and,
although no goods were sold, those
who visited the store had a chance to
view the large and complete stock on
exhibition. Business in the new
house will commence early this morn
ing and a record-breaking day la ex
pected by the officers of the firm.
A fine orchestra under the direction
of Ernest Williams, director of the
League of the Cross Cadets band, ren
dered a varied programme of popular
airs and classical selections. The offi
cers of the new firm â James J. GQdea,
Thomas H. Fallon, D. B. Ferguson and
R. W. Burke â were there to greet
their friends and patrons with a smile
and receive from them well wishes and
hearty congratulations on their suc
cess in opening one of the finest stores
in the city.
Messenger boys were kept busy all
day dodging in and out with telegrams
and messages from all parts of the
country from manufacturers and deal
ers, who sent their rearards to the offi
cers of the new concern. Many hand
some floral pieces and other tokens of
esteem were received by the members
of the firm from a host of friends.
The splendid new clothing and fur
nishing goods store of the J. J. Gildea
Company at 102S-1030 Market street
was thrown open to the public yester
day. The opening was an auspicious one.
and all day long and fax Into the night
the spacious store was thronged with
visitor?, who examined the splendid
assortment of goods in the store and
wished the new firm luck in its mam
moth undertaking.

San Francisco is awakening. If you
don't believe it, read this: '^an Fran
cisco is to have a Musical Art Society
on the same plan as the one in New
York, which gives artists' recitals at
the Waldorf-Astoria. The concerts
here will be given in the white and gold
banquet hall of the St. Francis HoteL"
Now, doesn't that sound good?
As the seating capacity of the hall is
limited, but four hundred memberships
will be sold. The artists engaged for
the first series are lime. Gadaki, Mr.
and Mrs. Arnold Dolmetsch and Miss
Kathline Salmon, who play on the old
instruments, such as the harpsichord,
virginal, lute, viola d'amour, viola de
gamba, etc. De Pachmann, the great
est of Chopin interpreters; Fritz iCreis
ler, the greatest of the classic violin
ists; David Bispham, the baritone, and
the famous Kneisel Quartet of Boston
will be among the artists. These are
among the greatest musical attractions
in the world and the list will certainly
be filled in very short order. The con
certs are under the direction of Will L.
Greenbaum. Applications for member
ship should be sent to him at the St.
Francis HoteL The concerts will be
given between December 25 and May 15
and will begin at 9 o'clock in the even
ing.
And thus is San Francisco evolving
from her coon-song era and Her provin
cialism, for the musical tastes of a
community are a fair index of its pro
gressiveness.

Â¦ Miss Rose Henhessy, well known asl
a poetess and elocutionist, of Lexington,
Ky., tells how she was cured of uterine
inflammation and ovaritis by the use of
Lydia R Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
** Dxab Mas. PraxHXir : â I hare been so blessedly helped through the usa
Â«f Lydia EL. Pizikiiam's Vegetable Compound that I feel it but just to
acknowledge it. hoping- that it may help some other woman suffering 1 as I did.
" For years I enjoyed the best of health and thought that I would always
do ao. I attended parties and receptions thinly clad, and would be suddenly
chilled, but I did not think cf the result*. I caug-ht a bad cold eighteen
months ago while menstruating-, and this caused inflammation of the womb
aad congested ovaries. I suffered excruciating- pains and kept getting- worse.
My attention was called to your "Vegetable Compound and the wonderful
ecres it had performed, and I made up my mind to trv it for two months and
aee what it would do for me. Within one month 1 felt much better, and
at the close of the Becond I was entirely welL
*' I hare advised a number of my lady friends to use it, and all express
themselves as well satisfied with the results as I was." â Miss Bosk Nora
HisrxKssT. 410 S. Broadway, Lexington. Ky.
The experience and testimony of some of the most noted
women of America go to prove beyond a question that Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will correct all snch trouble and
at once, by removing- the cause, and restoring: the organs to a
normal and healthy condition.
~ "Drab Mns> Pikkham : â About two years ago I consulted a phy-
sician about my health which had become so "wretched that I was no
longer able to be about. I had severe backache, bearing-down pains,
pains across the abdomen, was very nervous and irritable, and this
trouble grew -worse each mnnth, The physician prescribed for me, but
I soon discovered that he was unable to help me, and I then decided to
try Lydia E. Pinkham'g Vegetable Compound* and soon found that
it was doing- me good. My appetite was returning, the pains disappearr-
ing, and the general benefits were well marked.
" You cannot realize how pleased I was, and after taking the medi-
cine for only three months, I found that I was completely cured of my
trouble, and have been well and hearty ever since, and no more fear the
monthly period, as it now passes without pain to me. Yours very truly,
Mtss Pf.hri. AcKzas, 327 Summer fet, Nashville, Term."
When a medicine has been successful in restoring* to health
more than a million women, you cannot well say without trying it
** I do not believe it will help me." If you are ilL do not hesitate
to get a bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and
write Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn, Mass., for special advice. Her ad*
vice is free and helpful. Write to-day. Delay may be fatal.

Jones kept | up his good work by
pitching a magnificent game. He had
every Tiger on his staff, and his con
trol was as good as one -generally sees
at a ball game. Truck Eagan boosted
the ball over the center-field fence in
the fourth for a long homer, and but
for that gallant feat the Tigers would
have been snowballed.
There were two in the cellar when
Overall issued a pass to Devereaux in
the fifth round. No one thought much
of it, but Bill started for second when
Graham dropped the next thrown ball.
Charley was anxious to head Red off
at second and threw quickly. The sphere
went high over Hogan's head" and out
to the score-board. Urged on by the
yells and shouts of the fans, Devereaux
fairly fiew over those sacks and
reached the pan, tying the score.
Francks ushered in the sixth for the
Commuters with a two-base drive to
the shoe sign, which 'nets him a pair of
high-grade kicks. Dunleavy hit to
Overall and Francks was caught at
third, Dunleavy in the meanwhile get
ting down to second.
The hit-and-run signal was given,
and Dun got to third while Schlafley
was being put out at first. Kruger was
up, and had a strike on him, when
Dunleavy made his daring steal. Gra
ham motio'ned to Overall for an out
curve, and while the big fellow was
winding up Dun made for the pan. He
did not stop until he landed by sliding
safely under Graham, while Kruger
stood looking on.
That won the game, for the Tigers
never could get jerry to Jones. Doyle
was put out of the game in the third
inning for passing too much talk back
to Ferine. The latter showed his nerve,
and had the abusive Tigers standing
around and looking meek. He umpired
a swell game of ball. The score:

SUMMARY.
Mr. Dunleavy, the amiable center
fielder for the Commuters, started a
thousand hearts a-thumping yesterday
afternoon at Recreation Park when he
started on a mad race for the home
plate. On he came and the multitude
held its breath. Ball and runner
reached the pan at the same time, but
Dun slid under it. and Oakland's win
ning run had landed. Score: Oakland
2, Tacoma 1.
The interest and excitement which
marked the first game were again afp
parent in every round. It was right and
scrap and yell at the umpire all along
the line. Every player was possessed
of a supply of ginger which could not
be exhausted. Oakland played the bet
ter baseball and won. Graham's error
let them start, and then they finished
like champions.
Big Overall gave an exhibition of
twirling that was as brilliant as it was
erratic. None of the Commuters could
hit this giant, and had he any com
mand of the ball he might have estab
lished a world's record then and there.
Ten fanned, but six walked, and one
of these afterward came home with the
first run for the Commuters.

The game between Berkeley and
Oakland, played Wednesday afternoon,
was unsatisfactory. Berkeley undoubt
edly was the stronger team, and should
have won. As It was they lost by a
single point. Oakland got the ball on a
fumble and scored early in the game.
Berkeley earned its touchdown on good
line-bucking. The latter part of ,the
game was played in the dark and was
full of wrangling.
The winners of to-day's games â¢will
meet next Saturday for the champion
ship of the league.
The semi-final football games for
the championship of the Academic
League will be played to-morrow on
the Presidio grounds. In the morning
Santa Rosa High School, winner of the
Northern Sub-League series, meets
Oakland High School, winner of the
Central League. In the afternoon
Lick, the local champions, will meet the
Palo Alto High School boys, champions
of the Southern Sub-Leasue.
This Is the first year there have been
four teams in the semi-finals, and all
of them are strong. Oakland and Palo
Alto have figured in games with the
freshmen teams of Stanford and Cali
fornia. Stanford beat Palo Alto only
6Vo 0, while California beat Lick 10 to
0. Many consider the Lick eleven one
of the strongest that ever represented
a high school. Palo Alto will probably
prove faster, but it is doubtful If they
will fight as hard as Lick. Cavanaugh.
the great center from Chicago Uni
versity, has been assisting Smock in
coaching Lick during the week, and
the home eleven should go upon the
field with a good knowledge of the
game.

It was a well contested race from
start 10 finish, with varying features.
At no time could one of the hawk
eyed talent safely say the winner
could be designated until the last
stride. The stake was worth $10S5 to
the winner.
JAMAICA. Oct. 20. â Luck played a
conspicuous part to-day In the Â¦ de
cision of the Hempstead selling stake.
It was won by W. B. Leed's Merry
Lark, largely because his rider, Hilde
brand, was alert enough to take ad
vantage of the other competitors when
they swung wide. He sent Merry Lark
into the opening thus made and was
able to get him home first by a head
from Glen Echo. Prior to this Merry
Lark had been cut off twice at critical
moments.

CHICAGO, Oct. 20. â In a sensa
tional stretch run James Arthur's
Huzzah came from far back and won
the Alpine selling stakes to-day by
half a length at Worth. Ananias wa3
second. The stakes had a gross value
of $2360. of which 51865 went to the
winner, $800 to the second horse and
the balance to the third horse.
It was one of the most desperate
finishes seen at the track.' Five of the
Held of six siarters were in a compact
jam and it was anybody's race twenty
yards from . the wire. Xot until the
final stride could the winner be deter<
mined. Huzzah avoided all the early
pace and did not make his run until
turning for home. Then, comins with
a determined rush in the stretch, he
passed his field and won going "away.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
- The weather has. been warm and has
proved advantageous to Joe In taking
off, weight. He now weighs under 137
POUndS. f: . ; :. . . .
Billy McDonald says, "This talk
about Joe not making the weight is all
nonsense. Why," he said, "Joe will
make 133 pounds ringside and be, as
â¢strong as ever he was."
An hour's hard work in the gym
nasium convinced Joe's admirers that
he is in fine condition. He punched the
bag, twisted the wrist machines; pulled
the weights, jumped the rope a thou
sand times and wound up by .boxing
four fast rounds with Kid Sullivan. In
the morning he took a fourteen-mile
run.
Contrary to expectations, Joe Gans
put in a hard day's work yesterday at
his training quarters at Billy Shan
non's villa. It was programmed that
Joe should take things easy until next
Monday, but many of his friends jour
neyed to his quarters expecting to see
him perform and Billy McDonald, not
wishing to disappoint them, counter
manded his previous order and told Joe
to go to work. â¢
Britt weighed 135% pounds yesterday
and his plan is not to begin to reduce
for some time yet. On .the contrary he
will build himself up to a weight great
er than that at which he now tips the
beam. ; \:.~ ,
Eight miles on the road and a plunge
in the bay constituted Britt's work in
the morning.. In the afternoon he box
ed four rounds with Frank Rafael and
went through his usual stunts with the
medicine ball, punching bag and wrist
machines. Jimmy received . a delega
tion of visitors, including James Britt
Sr., Spider Kelly and George Webster
of this city and Peter Cronin, Frank
Meyers and Frank Corbett of-San
Mateo. The last three headed a dele
gation from their - : home town, where
Britt has many admirers. Colonel
Brady will ' chaperon a delegation to
morrow. .
Persons who have visited the training
quarters of the rival lightweights pro
nounce them in wonderful condition.
Britt's friends are particularly pleased
with his healthy, appearance and with
his speed in boxing.
Wrestling in the water has been add
ed to Britt's programme of training at
Croll's Gardens, Al-meda. The little
fighter took on Churloy "Tiv" Kreling
of the Olympic Club yesterday In a
lively catch-as-catch-can bout in the
surf. The man of Â«he gloves and the
man of the mat went at it like a pair
of sealions. Honors were about even
when time was called, although Kreling
weighs thirty pounds more than Britt.
Jimmy affirms that water wrestling
teaches one how to get out of a.slip
pery place in a slippery manner and
also improves the wind, .particularly If
the other fellow, holds his opponent un
der the waves ,whlle he is scoring
points.
Kreling has become a member of
Britt's training staff and will engage
the fighter every day- in gymnasium
and surf bouts. Jimmy figures he. may
have to do some hustling work when
he gets in close to Joe Gans and fig
ures that Krellng's knowledge : of the
game of hold and haul will prove of
value to him." "~l';~^
Both sides are supposed to have
kindly feeling for Billy Roche, who has
made no mistakes in the ring up to the
present time.
Al Herford has expressed a wish (for
an Eastern referee, but Britt has stated
he will not entertain such a proposi
tion. Both" will probably be a little shy
in making a decided stand for any
man. They have fresh in their minds
the Young Corbett-Graney episode and
the Gans- Welch affair of recent oc
currence.
While Britt is not taking the world
into his confidence it is thought Eddie
Graney would about fill his ideal as to
what a referee should be. .
The selection of a referee, the last of
the Important preliminary details of
the Brltt-Gans fight, will be settled to
night at a- conference between the rep
resentatives of the ' boxers * at Harry
Corbett's. - - Â¦ Â¦",

The turplus for the year, altar paying divi
dends and other charge*, is *1.717.2t57, an In
crease of *2Â«8.72tJ.
The Increase in operating expenses is ac

charrtd to operating expenses. There was ex
pended aad charged to operating expenses for

two modem vessels.

Since the model for the Impressive fe- j
male figure was completed 6y Robert I. ;
Aitken eight months ago the foundry \
people have been hard at work in as- ;
sembling materials and men. . and in Â¦
casting the several sections of the fig- -
ure. Long before the sculptor's model
reached the foundry skilled artisans
from France were sent for. These are
men who hold the secret of casting &
bronze by a method unknown to the
workmen of any other . country. The
Frenchmen brought with them a pe
culiar modeling clay that is > essential
to ' their process '.. of bronze-casting.
From start to finish the actual work in
bronze has been done by the French
men, and the final result has fully at
tested their efficiency. .So jealously
have they guarded their secret that
they even refused the assistance of
American apprentice boya, for fear
that these would learn the methods.
At present the statue consists of six
sections that repose In different parts
of the foundry. In a few. days these;
sections will . be joined, the seams filled ;
and the largest single figure yet cast on
thC Pacific Coast will be ready for Its i
pedestal. The figure is that of a full-!
draped female \ crowned with bay j
leaves, the features classical and the!
hair dressed ~ in Grecian fashion. In;
her right hand she holds a spear, while j
in her left is an extinguished torch I
with palm branches. 1
The statue will be mounted on a
square granite column, en the front of
which will be a large marble medallion
of William McKlnley, and at the base,
on the four sides, a convenient seat.
The whole shaft will be on a circular!
granite platform reached by steps sur
rounding the entire edifice. The un-t
veiling will probably take place about J
Thanksgiving day. â¢ -. ;
The committee having charge of the j
monument consists of James T>. Phelan. â¢
president; A. A. Watklns. vice presi
dent; Captain Robert Eletcher, secre
tary; D. J. O'Leary, Rolla V. Watt.
William Greer Harrison, and B. J. S. {
Cahlll, supervising architect. The late
Irving M. Scott was also a member at
the committee. Louis de. Rome has
had charge of the entire work at the !
foundry/" â¢ . ~ ' Â¦ j
- The casting- in bronze for the .monu
ment that Is to be erected In the Park
Panhandle - to : the memory of William
McKlnley took place . yesterday after
noon at the Globe Brass and BÂ«ll
Foundry, 126 Main street, in the pres
ence of the monument committee, art
ists, architects and students of the
Mark Hopkins Art Institute. The final
casting passed without a bitch, and in
a few days the sections of the huge
fifteen-foot bronze figure will be joined
together and sent to the Baker-street
entrance of the park, where the pedes
tal awaits it.
After lengrthy arguments on each
side the court reserved bis Judgment,
intlmatine, however, that he Would
decide in "favor of Chlttenden.
The case wa3 opened by Manson F.
McCormick, assisted by Everts & Ew
ing of Fresno. Truman & Oliver and'
Bishop, Wheeler & Hoefler of San
Francisco. Frank H. Gould and E. O.
Miller of Visalia represent the Admin
istrator of Tulare County. Gould's con
tention is that the Tulare County Ad
ministrator is entitled to the letters
because his application was filed three
days before Chlttenden's; but Chit
tenden's attorneys claim that in the
absence of proof to the contrary the
letters issued are good.
Af ter denying several attempts to
delay the matter till the Tulare County
court and the probate court of New
York could be heard from. Judge
Church went on with the case. BJx
and Ewing argued that Gould had no
standing in court, being shut out
by his failure to protest- The court re
served a ruling on this question.
FRESNO, Oct. 20.â "A scramble over
a dead man's bones," aa Frank H.
Gould, one of the attorneys In the
case, termed it, was in progress all
day before Superior Judge Church.
The court heard a rcotion to. set aaido
ths letters of administration Issued" to
Public Administrator R. D. Chitten
den of Fresno in the $300,000 estate of
John Davis. The estate waa mainly
derived from Samuel Davis, an ec
centric millionaire of San Francisco,
who died last September. The Admin
istrators of three counties â Tulare,
San Francisco and Fresno â are con
cerned in the fight.
Sp-ecial Dispatch to The Call.
The Oceanic Company's steamship
il^riposa. sailed from Pacific-street
wharf at 11 o'clock yesterday morn
ing with freight and many passengers
for Tahiti. Three hours later the
liner Ventura left the same dock for
Honolulu and the Antipodes. She
carried a full cargo and a big passen
ger list. The wharf was crowded with
friends of the departing travelers, as
sembled to bid them good-by. In the
cabin were sixty-four passengers for
Honolulu, thirty-five for Auckland,
five for Pago Pago and seventy-two
icr Sydney.
Purser E. H. Backman of the Ven
tura, who has been East on a vaca
tion, resumed his position on the ves
sei- '-.?-";...
F. H. "Workman, one of the passen
g-ers. went to Sydney without his
trunk. As the gangplank was being
hauled in he hurried down the wharf
Â«.nd ran aboard. The expressman lift
ed the trunk to the edge of the -wharf
and a line being thrown to him he
took a secure turn around it, but he
Â¦would not permit the trunk to be
hauled aboard the steamer until he
had received his pay. "Workmen ar
pied with the expressman, but the
latter had possession and threatened
to cut the rope if the deck hands tried
to haul the trunk away from him
While the wrangle was going on the
\encsra backed out from the wharf
and the rope was cast off. But in
pulling the line aboard the ship the
trank waa dragged overboard into the
bay and as the Ventura straightened
?" JÂ° r , ***. -^tipo<ies the faithful
.rusk ofa faithless owner tried to fol
low. Two longshoremen hauled it
from the bay and up on the dock with
the water pouring out of it. The liner
is now well down toward Honolulu
end the trunk with its ruined contents
is waiting at the Harbor poliee sta
tion.

Mr. Fickert was allowed a ten days'
stay to enable him to perfect an ap
peal.
"I think it is shown by the tes
timony," said Mr. Fickert, "that Lim
went to China at the age of
four years and lived there with
his Â¦ parents until he became of
age. At that time he did not elect to
become a citizen of the United States,
but continued to live there and re
mained a subject of the Emperor of
China. It is a principle recognized by
a large number of States and by. this
country where there Is a conflicting
claim to the allegiance of the petition
er, one country claiming him by reason
of his birth within its Jurisdiction and
the other by virtue of his parentage,
he must, upon reaching his majority
or within a reasonable time thereafter,
make an election of his nationality. If
the petitioner remained in China after
having become of - full age he is pre
sumed to have abjured his American
nationality and for that reason should
be denied admission to the United
States even if he could establish the
fact that he was born in the United
States."
Commissioner Heacock said he did
not think that the point could be raised
in this case upon the testimony- "I
think," he added, "that he has given
a reasonable excuse for not returning
sconer and the testimony is affirma
tive that he was all the time thinking
of returning to this country when he
came of age. Therefore I hold adverse
ly to the Government on this proposi
tion.".
Judge de Haven said yesterday that
he could not see anything in the testi
mony to warrant his reversing the ac
tion of the commissioner.
Counsel for the Government received
a setback yesterday â¢ in the United
States District Court by the discharge
of Lim Fong on habeas corpus. Lim
alleged he was born in Oakland and
as a native American demanded ad
mission to this tcountry on his" return
from China, whither he had been taken
when a child by his parents. The Chin
ese Bureau, always stricter with men
than with women, denied him admis
sion. On the habeas corpus hearing
before Commissioner Heacock Assist
ant United States Attorney Charles
M. Fickert raised the point that admit
ting Lim's statement to be true, he
was a native American, but he had
forfeited his right to be a citizen by
remaining in China and allowing him
self after his majority to be considered
a subject of that Government.
A few days before Mr. Lent was
taken fatally ill Miss Fannie visited
her closest friends and told them that
she knew that her father must die.
She added that in that event she would
have nothing further to live for, al
though she loved her brothers and
sister.* Â¦ _.
"My father has been very near and
dear to me," she said, "and if he
were taken from me I should have
little that I care to live for. I have
had nothing but trouble for years and
he . has been my comfort and ; the
brightest spot in my - life." J '
Wednesday afternoon the remains of
Mr. Lent were interred in the Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery and ; after the funeral
Miss Lent returned to the Polk street
mansion and retired to her . room,
where she gave violent vent to her
great ; grief. . At about 9 o'clock she
announced that she was . in need of
sleep and bid her brother. and friends
good-night. Her ; death: is thought to
have occurred soon after this hour.
Most" of Miss Lent's time was de
voted to societies that have -for their
purpose the distribution of clothing
and food: for the- poor. r No woman in*
the city had a higher character.
From the date of this separation
Miss Lent was never the same. She
inherited her mother's sweet disposi
tion and patience, but despite her
pleasing characteristics there was a
shadow over all that could not be dis
sipated.; Offers of marriage were not
uncommon to Miss Lent, but she
spurned them. Her experience had
been too bitter for one of her retiring
nature to soon forget, and she made
up her mind to live the life for all that
home, mother, father, sister and
brothers could make it.
Then fell the second great affliction.
One of her brothers died. Following
quickly upon this blow came the death
of the mother. The interval between
Mrs. Lent's death and the death of the
father was one of trial for Miss Fannie.
She realized that the old gentleman
had not long to life, for as he put it:
"My daughter, I am growing weaker
and I fear that I will not be with you
very much longer." Bffffl
SUE SAW THE END.
Captain Alexander proved himself a
frivolous person, a man who would not
"fit a character for Kipling or one who
Â¦could live the part of the "bold and
dashing soldier of the plains." He was
weak and 1 shallow. Miss Lent, who
was a woman of keen perception and
fine feelings, learned in a few
days to abhor his personality and the
honeymoon was cut short by the bride
leaving the hotel one evening and hur
rying back to her father in San Fran
cisco.
BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT.
Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock her
brother George sent, a young woman
named Hannah Sullivan to awaken his
sister. Miss Lent's bedroom was emp
ty and her bed had not been occupied.
The brother immediately searched the
house and on approaching the bath
room on the second floor detected the
odor of gas. In a trice he forced an
entrance and found his unfortunate
sister prone upon the. floor, the room
filled with gas. Life was extinct and
it was plain that the young woman had
committed suicide, so Mr. Lent tele
phoned to the Coroner. Dr. Leland
permitted the remains to be held at the
home, where the Inquest will be held
to-day.
Miss Lent, who has always been
known as "Mrs. Lent," acknowledging
marriage, but avoiding use of her hus
band's name, retired at about 9 o'clock
Wednesday evening- The supposition
is that she immediately went to the
bathroom, placed the quilt on the floor
and turned on the gas.
On Wednesday afternoon Miss Fannie
attended the funeral of her father. Her
grief was painful to behold. Friends
said that they feared for her mental
ity, and those who knew of her other
sorrows remarked that wealth does not
always bring happiness.
It was in the stately old mansion at
the corner of Polk and Eddy streets that
Miss Lent pledged her love to Captain
Alexander of the regular army. This
was when she was a pretty young so
ciety bud, much admired by the hand
some gallants of the days when the
Lent residence was one of the centers
of social activity. The wedding was
attended by only a few intimate friends
of the family and after the ceremony
the bridal pair left for an army post
in Arizona; whence they proceeded to
New York, where sumptuous apart
ments were ordered at the Windsor Ho
tel.
DISCOVERY OF BODY.
The charm of social enjoyment had
faded from her desire and repeated sor
row preyed upon her sensitive nature.
In a bathroom of the Lent residence
she removed the Jet from the gas burn
er some time during Wednesday night,
turning on the poisonous vapor, lay
down upon a quilt that she had care
fully spread upon the floor of the
apartment, and died.
This brief . record of family history
goes far to explain the probable mo
tive that prompted Miss Fannie Lent
to end her existence with her own
hands.
Last Monday William Lent, father,
died at the ripe age of 86 years. He was
a pioneer, a man of wealth and a mer
chant of the old California school. The
daughter was devoted to him and dur
ing his illness she was his constant
companion.-
Two years ago Mrs. William M. Lent,
mother of Miss Fannie, Miss Catherine
and of Eugene and George Lent, died.
No sweeter woman ever moved in the
exclusive social set of San Francisco.
None grieved for her more than did
Miss Fannie.
Troubles such as seldom enter the
life of a young woman of wealth, cul
ture and social position bore heavily
upon Miss Fannie Lent, daughter of
the late William M. Lent, and yester
day they ended in suicidal death at
the home of the Lents. 699 Polk street.
Fifteen years ago Miss Lent was dis
appointed in marriage. ' From that
time to the date of her death she has
lived only for the good that she could
do others and not for the good she
could accomplish for herself.
Annie B. Higgins yesterday filed an
affidavit on a motion for an order di
recting Theodore S. Higgins, dentist
and hotel-keeper, to show cause why
he should not be punished for con
tempt of court. She says that he has
paid only $45 under the order of the
court awarding her $100 a month ali
mony and $250 for fees. There is now
$305 due. She also charges that he
violated the court's injunction against
the removal of furniture from the Ho
tel Inverness: that he did remove some
of the furniture and then forced her
to dispose of her interest in the busi
ness at less than It was worth.
Divorces were granted by Judge
Kerrigan to Josephine Poole from An
drew E. Poole. desertion; to Louise A.
Howard from William S. Howard, neg
lect; by Judge Hebbard to Ellse
Koebsch from Charles W. Koebsch.
desertion; by Judge Graham to Cath
erine Pearson ' from John Pearson,
cruelty; by Judge Sloss to Fred N.
Hall from Maud M. Hall, cruelty; by
Judge Seawell to Nellie R. Henry from
Clarence A. Henry, for cruelty. In the
Henry case the husband was accused
of having denied in public that Nel
lie was his wife, of turning on the gas
in her room without lighting It and
of going to Manila with the intention
of deserting her. .
Suits for divorce were filed by Frank
J. Gregory against Margaret Gregory,
dtsertlon; Emma Frances Howe
against Sam Howe, desertion; John
Peltier against Marie Peltier, deser
tion (she left him six days after their
marriage in August of last year);
Thomas G. Jones against Levina Jones,
desertion; Anna M. Brewer against
John W. Brewer, cruelty. The Brew
ers were married on September 2,
1903, and on the 8th he knocked her
down. Twice since then, she says, he
has threatened to kill her.
The Judge who hears the divorce
suit of Eunice P. Cushman against
Charles H. Cushman will have to re
read Harriet Beecher Stowe's classic
or go again to a "Tom Show" in or
der to appreciate the force of one of
the allegations in the wife's lurid
complaint. After reciting several spe
cific acts of Cushman's cruelty to her
self and children. Mrs. Cushman
summarizes his tendency to inhuman
ity in the following words: "The
defendant is of a domineering, tyran
nical and nagging disposition and has
a violent and uncontrollable temper
and during a great part of the time
since his marriage with the plaintiff
he has acted the part of Legree in
â¢Uncle Tom's Cabin' and. with his
whip in hand, domineered and ruled
over the plaintiff and his children,
keeping them in constant fear of bodi
ly injury."
Cushman earns $70 a month in the
Oakland postomce and owns property
in San Francisco worth $6300, the dis
position of which has been enjoined by
Judge Kerrigan.
Attorney Clara M. Foltz appeared in
Judge Kerrigan's court yesterday for
Mattie Gilliland, who obtained a di
vorce from Frank Gilliland on the
ground of neglect. The husband was
in court and wanted to interpose an
answer unless the plaintiff would agree
to waive claims for alimony and coun
sel fees. "I told you on the car this
morning that we wanted nothing,"
said Mrs. Foltz, and Bailiff Duffy
forced Gilliland to subside.
In Judge Hebbard's court Isabella
Lagomarsino obtained an annulment
of her marriage with Louis . Lagomar
slno, which occurred on December 24,
1902, when she was only 16 years and
5 months old. The suit was brought
through her father, Alexander Malerbi,
who had not consented to the union.
James M. Daley sued his wife, Pin
oliver Daley, for divorce on the
grounds of desertion, intemperance

CHICAGO BOARD, OF TRADE.
. Future Grain and Provisions. *~*
-CHICAGO. Oct. Â£0.â Notwithstanding-, liberal
receipts Northwest and easier cables, a firm
undertone j prevailed In th* wheat market at i
the opening.- December was up *Â£@Uc to!
SeVic at $1 14% to $1 15>-i, while May waa \
Uc lower to KÂ« higher at $1 13% to $1 14i s . i
The initial firmness was due mainly to report- j
ed scarcity of milling wheat. A sharp break |
in prices 1 at Minneapolis, however, socn brought
out heavy sales here by pit traders and com- â¢
mission houses, the Impression apparently be- ;
ing that the lower prices In the Northwest <
foreshadowed a - still greater Increase in the j
country movement in that section. In conse
quence sentiment for a time was rather bear- ,
lsh. The declining tendency was checked by Â¦Â¦
an active demand from shorts and some of the !
big bull traders. Following & rally at Mlnne- j
apolls the market here also became etrong.
December advancing to $1 16>i. May sold
up to $1 14%. On a sharp -break in corn
about this time the wheat market was sub
jected to heavy realizing sales, as a' result of
which sentiment became quite weak. Â¦Â¦ Selling i
pressure was increased . by larger arrivals at '
Kaneas City and St. Louis an-i by exceedingly j
small exports for the day. The market' was
further weakened by the execution of stop-loss !
orders and by a slackened demand for cash I
wheat at all outside points. The low point j
on December for the day was reached at $1 14% '
and on May at $1 12 H. Some recovery was
made on covering by shorts, but the close was
weak, with December at $1 14%61 14%. Final
quotations on May were at $1 13?&.
Firm cables and wet weather In portions â¢
cf the West paused an active demand for corn â¢
early In the session, resulting tn-a strong mar- |
ket. December closed at 43 He. ,
The action of wheat and corn had an In-'
fluency in the oats market. December closed ,
at 2SÂ»Â»c. , - . . i
Provisions were steady on fair support by :
pit traders. At the close January pork - was
up Sc at $12 40. Lard was down 2*4c at â¢
$7 17^4- Ribs were unchanged at $6 47^..
The leading futures ranged as follows: 1

There .was another break in Alaska Packers
yesterday. The stock, which closed cn
Wednesday at $108 bid. opened at $10T and
steadily declined to 1105,. closing, the day at
this flsure. The- rumor "of several days ago
that the company would issue It* 26<xrshArei
remaining stock and also can In the. $33 still
unpaid on the Issued stock, was charged with
the decline. The sales were " numerous and
generally small, such as five and ten share
lots. Indicating either manipulation or un
loading on the part of 'small Investors. There
were also a good many, small sales of Gas &
Electric, ranging from ?58 to $'-9 '4. with
f".\ bid and $58 H asked at the close. The
other stocks were quiet and featureless. The
United Railway 4s were active and steady.

: Local, trade In -fresh fruits was quite, active
owing to the warm, sunny weather, but sup
plies of most descriptions were more than
sufficient for . requirements, and as there was
no movement In shipping channels prices of
several kinds had a downward tendency. Figs
were in. limited supply and firm, but there
were ample supplies of Apples and other de
ciduous fruits available, and some dealers
wero shading quotations. Prices â¢ of strictly
fancy Apples were well maintained, but a
weak feeling prevailed, as it was known that
several cars of Oregon and Colorado Applet
were rolling this way. Table Grapes in crates
were lower owing to the lack of demand for
shipping, but oPen boxes were firm, with the
best offerings of Tokay and Muscat selling at
$1 5061 75 pep box. - A little more activity
was noted In Melons, but prices showed no
Improvement. A considerable portion . of.
Wednesday's belated receipts of Berries were
offering to the detriment of fresh stock, and
the market was weak in consequence. Cltru,s

The. weakness in Butter was still more pro
nounced yesterday. Receipts from the northern
coast were heavy, and' as trade was very
dull all hands wanted to sell. As the day
went on the pressure to sell increased and
late In the afternoon creameries were freely
offered atÂ» lc less than during the forenoon.
Complaint* of the dullness in trade Increased.

vious prices with featureless markets.

The feature of the Butter market at present
Is j the appearance of a new kind of outside
competition with the California product. A
large concern in Sioux City Iowa, which has
heretofore sold -goods on this market in cubes
through brokers has just established an office
in this city ami is selling the best Eastern
creamery, direct to retailers in the form i of
1-lb full- weight blocks put up in cartons. The
present price to arrive is 2Sc. The trade say
that if this is kept up It is bound to be a
factor in this market from now en.

Indictment Against One of

insoh Murder Dismissed
'.William B. Kennedy, alias "Yellow,"
alias v Richard Jackson, charged with
the- murder of Po-llceman > C.
.Robinson at Sixteenth and Valencia
streets on* Jariuary 21,- 1902,- was . re
leased; from custody by order of Judge
Lawlor yesterday. He "made -his exit
from the Hall of Justice as; quickly as
possible and when some one shouted
to him. that - Detectives {Dliian and
Wren were waiting for him on. the cot-,
ner he shot across Kearny street as
fast as he could run in the direction of
Chinatown.
Kennedy's case is a celebrated one.
He is said by the police to be th.e worst
of the gang of six desperadoes impli
cated in the policeman's murder. Ken
nedy hsld up a Japanese a few min
utes, before the murder and it was the
report of a shot fired at the Japanese
by Kennedy that brought Robinson
upon the scene.
Kennedy was tried and convicted by
a Jury in Judge Cook's court, but was
granted a new trial by the Judge, who
was supported by the Supreme - Court
on an appeal taken by the District At
torney. The, ground taken by the Su
preme Court' was that Kennedy could
not be convicted on the uncorroborated
testimony of an accomplice, William
A. Henderson. After that Kennedy was
discharged by Judge Cook, but was
arrested several times ; and always re
leased on writs of habeas corpus. Fin
ally the. District* Attorney 'submitted
the case to the Grand Jury and a new
indictment, was found against Ken
nedy. The [case was assigned to Judge
Lawlor*s court. ..
- The case came up for trial yesterday
morning and Assistant District Attor
ney. Ashe, after reading a long state
ment reviewing the ; case from . its ~- In
ception,; had 'to admit. that no^new evi
dence Â¦} had > been - procured. He asked
for a continuance for ten- days: till Dis
trict Attorney Byington could â¢ be pres
ent. QbMBPbSQBI
The .Judge refused to grant a con
tinuance and' dismissed the Indictment.
Attorney Newburg for the defendant
.wanted a Jury impaneled and the case
tried- on "its merits, but the. Judge de
clined ; to ; do so. If this had been done
Kennedy would, have been 'free, but as
It is he cahtbe rearrested if new evi
dence can" be " found within â the next

James Keough of 1201 Sanchex
nereet. accused of disturbing: the peace
of his wife and daughter Mary, told
Judge Cabaniss of how it came to pass.
He sallied forth in the evenlns. he
said, to distribute election cards bear
ing the portrait and name of a certain
candidate for Superior Judge, and In
the process of distribution he Imbibed
quite a number of drinks. He was
not drunk, however, when the cards
were all gone, and he incidentally
ltarned that an old and esteemed
friend of his had died the previous
day and was then being "waked." and,
although the hour was late, he de
cided to show his respect for the de
ceased and to express sympathy for
the sorrowing relatives by visiting the
house of mourning. There he drank
whisky and remained till morning, and
when he went home his wife and
daughter berated him so roundly that
perhaps he did disturb their peace. But
be was fleeing from their presence
Â¦when Mary grabbed his coat tails as
he was climbing over the back-yard
fence and detained him until Patrol
man Stanton arrived and arrested
him.
As he had several prior convictions
There was a complete turning of the
tables yesterday in a case that for
more than a week has been on Police
Judge Mogan's calendar. Rudolf Mil
ler, a butcher, accused of 111 treating
hie family, was clearly proved the vic
tim of an effort on the part of his wife
and her paramour to "railroad" him to
prison so that he could not interfere
with their liaison. He was acquitted
and the woman and her accomplice
received a merciless oral caatlgatlon
from the bench.
Miller was arrested on complaint or
his wife, who testified that he had
driven her from their home, 4% Hoff
avenue, and kept her in the street
while their five small children were
crying within the house. The defend
ant denied the charge and informed
the Judge that It had been solely made
with the object of setting him out of
the way. His wife, he added, had be
ccme so infatuated with one John ua.
vis, a laborer, that she abandoned her
little ones and was living with him
when Secretary White of the California
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children compelled her to return
and resume her maternal duties. W hen
the Judge asked the woman whether
her husband's statement were true she
answered In the negative, but her
words lacked the ring of honesty and
the hearing was continued till yester
day and a subpena issued for Secretary
White. J- _ r
There was no equivocation about Mr.
White's testimony. It corroborated
what Miller had said relative to the
woman's infidelity and neglect of her
offspring. Then the Judge asked the
Â¦wife what she meant by perjuring her
eelf at the previous hearing and she
was stammering out an unintelligible
explanation when a raucous voice from
the auditory exclaimed, "I would like
to be heard In this matter." and a bur
ly, rough looking man stood up and
claimed the court's attention. He was
asked what he desired to say.
"I'd like to have that man sent to
Jail," he responded, pointing at Mil
ler.
"Who are you?" Inquired the Judge.
"My name is John Davis, and I
"How dare you address this court?"
thundered the magistrate- "Bailiff, ex
pel that man from the chamber In
stantly!" and as the order was obeyed
with promptness and^ utter disregard
for the bodily comfort of John Davis,
the Judge forcibly expressed his esti
mate of the fellow's impudence.
Miller was then discharged and his
wife informed that she was saved from
prosecution for perjury by considera
tion for the little ones who unfortu
nately were dependent upon her for
care.
The Judge pronounced Mr. Castag
nino- guilty of disturbing the peace of
an Individual and postponed- sentence
Indefinitely, .so as to afford him oppor
tunity-to show by his conduct that he
can shun the object of his unrecipro
cated adoration. -.J .'
The defendant, a stalwart fellow,
tried to make it appear to Judge Mogan
that the, girl had exaggerated her
grievance, but she faced â¢ him, support
ed by her mother, and made him vir
tually confess that since she. first pre
sented him with the â¢ mitten her recep
tion of his advances had been discour
aging: . . -
May Torre, a petite brunette, com
plained that her life was made a dreary
waste because of the unwelcome at
tentions to which she was subjected by
Emlglio Castagnino. a house painter.
For two years he had been her
"steady," glre said, when she wearied
of : his company and politely but firm
ly Informed him that their relation
ship must cease. Instead of taking his
dismissal in kindly spirit he pressed
his suit more ardently than ever be
fore and at home, 1821 Dupont. street,
and abroad she was pestered by him.
She hated to drag the matter Into
court, but the man had become â¢ such
an importunate bore that his restraint
by law was absolutely essential to her
pursuit of happiness.
Peter Canelleas and Chris Malens are
natives of sunny Greece and rival deal
ers in fruits on the flrst block of Fourth
street. They met at Davis*and Oregon
streets early yesterday morning and
engaged in a wordy, war which devel
oped into the more serious aspect of a
duel with vegetables as weapons. Wit
nesses of the encounter testified before
Judge Mogan that while. the fight was
in progress the air was laden with gar
den and orchard products hurled at
each other by the combatants and that
when a policeman stopped active hos
tilities by arresting both of them they
were, sorry sights to behold. SIgnor
Canelleas' ammunition was confined to
tomatoes until he was driven from his
base by the shower of cantaloupes cast
with remarkable accuracy of aim by
Signor Malens. Squashes, egg fruit
and artichokes were â¢ also freely ex
changed. In view of their mutual will
ingness to pay for all the "truck"
spoiled by them and in consideration
of their necessary purchase of new
outer garments, the defendants were
dismissed with the usual reprimand.
John H. Montgomery, a real estate
agent from Oakland, charged John
Doyle and Frank Roberts with having
robbed him of a purse containing $24 65
night before Ia6t In a saloon at Fourth
and Folsom streets. Judge Mogan has
set next Saturday for the taking of
testimony.
Thomas E. Brady, charged with
street-begging, pleaded half guilty be
fore Judge Cabaniss and was given
twenty-four hours' imprisonment. He
had begged, he claimed, but as the
complaining policeman had not caught
him In the act he considered himself
only half guilty of the offense specific
ally alleged. ;:
Joseph Royder also showed such
symptoms of a mind diseased that he
was remanded for examination as to
his sanity. He challenged Manager
Harrison of the Sutro Baths to a duel
with pistols and then informed Judge
Mogan, that the den" was seriously in
tended, as he desired to kill Mr. Har
rison, but In fair fight. He was dis
charged from his position as an at
tendant at the baths and sought san
guinary reprisal.
Dr. K. A. Ambrosewf, a retired Rus
sian physician residing at 870 Mission
street, was arrested on complaint of
his wife, Gertrude, who thinks his
mentality is impaired by excessive in
dulgence in opiates. He threatened to
kill her, she informed Judge Mogan,
and she would like to have him sub
jected to examination by alienists.
During her recital the defendant,
bearded and frock coated, gazed at his
environment in a bewildered way. He
was ordered into custody until Sat
urday, and if by that time his mind is
not improved he will be sent to the In
sanity Commissioners for investiga
tion.
Miss Trixie Hunter and Miss Nellie
Conway. arrested for .vagrancy at
Fourth, and Stevenson streets, as
sured Judge Cabaniss that it was their
debut in the Police Court and he took
their word for it and dismissed them
with a caution. That they -were novices
there was no doubt, for instead of
hastening to the street, as prior ex
perience would have taught them to
do, they ascended to the City Prison
and were puzzling the desk sergeant
when an officer of the court happened
to arrive and convinced them that
they were at liberty to depart.
When the case of Fitzgerald Mur
phy, playwright, charged with kick
ing the nose of M. E. Revis, manager
of the Hotel Meredith, was called in
Judge Mogan's court neither the com
plainant nor the defendant's wife ap
peared to testify lor the prosecution.
But there did appear for the defense
one Jo&ejih Callahan, an actor at the
Majestic Theater, who testified that he
had known Mr. Murphy "on and oft"
for a dozen years, and had never seen
him drunk, but always found him a
man of admirable , temperament. Of
the defendant's domestic life, how
ever, Mr. Callahan could only repeat
what he had heard others say, and
that was invariably to the effect that
conjugal felicity existed in the Mur
phy household. Case continued until
Saturday and subpenaes issued' for
Mrs. Murphy and Mr. Revis. '. : V-;I
on similar charges to his discredit, Mr.
Keough was given eighty days' im
prisonment, thus being deprived of the
opportunity to vote for the' candidate
whose cards he distributed.

GUTIGURA REMEDIES.
A Remarkable Testimonial From
a Most Intelligent and /
Trustworthy Lady.
"A tumor came on my neck and in a
day or two it was as large as half an
crasge. I was very much alarmed for
fear it was malignant. My friends
tried to persuade me to consult ray
physician; but dreading that he would
Insist on using the knife I would not
consent to go. Instead I got Cuticura
Resolvent and Cuticura Ointment. I
took the former according to directions
and spread a thick layer of the Oint-
ment on the swelling. On renewing
it I would bathe my neck in very^warm
water and Cuticura Soap. In a few
days the Cuticura Ointment had drawn
.the swelling. to a head, when it broke.
Every morning it. was opened with a
larpe sterilized needle, âsqueezed -and
bathed, and fresh Â¦ Ointment put > on.
Pus and blood and a yellow, cheesy,
tumorous matter came out, " In about
three or four weeks' time ; this ; treat-
ment completely eliminated the tumor.
