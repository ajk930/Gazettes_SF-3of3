LONDON, April 16.â The Times corÂ«
respondent at sea off the coast of Ko
rea, under yesterday's date, " gives the
following story of recent skirmishes on
the Yalu River: . .
"On April 3 a Japanese cruiser sent
to reconnoiter thÂ©- mouth of the Yalu
found the enemy, holding both banks
of the river. Reconnoiterlng by steam
launch was abandoned, and last Sun
day Lieutenant Kyaguchi, with five
men disguised as Korean fishermen in
a native Junk, surprised a Russian post
at a village on the left bank. The Rus
sians retired without resistance. r A
quarter of an hour later two squadrons
of Japanese cavalry from Chongju ar
rived and destroyed the Russian post.
"Lieutenant Kyaguchl then deter
mined to reconnoiter the' left bank of
the river near Antung, and met In mid
stream a junk engaged in "a similar re
connaissance for the Russians. The
junk drew off and stranded on a small
bank. One of the Russians was killed
and the rest took to the water. The
Japanese continued Â¦ to - fire, when the
Russians threw away their rifles and
were obliged to wade neck deep in or-r
der to reach the mainland.
"Meantime a second Russian junk
with seventeen men landed on the sand
bank and tried to rescue the stranded
boat, but thsy were forced to abandon
the effort, and with difficulty escaped:

pound, near the \:zl\, where several
private houses are situated. The im
perial family,' headed by the Emperor,
Yi-Hyeung, fled in great haste "and
escaped with some difficulty to the
American legation.
The flames spread rapidly and in a
short time were beyond control. For
tunately for the city, the wind, though
brisk, blew from the northeast and the
flames were carried inisde the palace
grounds. This saved the British lega
tion and the English church and or
phanage.'
In a short time the various buildings
in the' compound were destroyed. The
rooms - of European construction, in
which the Emperor usually held audi
ences, shared â¢ the . same fate. Unfor
tunately, Korean* etiquette kept the
gates locked and 'the fire brigades were
not admitted.

The big battleship went at full speed
for nearly three miles toward the
beach, hoisting signals to the Texas,
Scorpion and one or two other vessels,
all of which were following close.
The tug was almost run down by
the Missouri. The latter continued at
full speed, with the smoke pouring
out of her turret, to within 100 yards
of the beach, when the battleship was
brought to a standstill. The tug was
close behind the big ship and Captain
Cowles could be seen on the bridge,
giving instructions to his men.
Streams of water were playing on the
turret. Just before the ship reached
the beach the tugboat men saw Cap
tain Cowles turn from h's work of
directing the fighting of the fire and
observe the ship. He immediately
gave orders and the big ship came to
a stop so close to the beach that the
men on the tugboat and other ships
though she was ashore.
The master of the tug started his
vessel toward the Missouri, when she
suddenly turned and started toward
shore at full speed, signaling the tug
to follow.
PENSACOLA, Fla., April 15.â The
master of an ocean tug gives the best
account given yet of the explosion in
the twelve-inch turret of the battleship
Missouri, which occurred Tuesday, kill-
Ing thirty-two men. The tug was 100
yards distant from the Missouri when
the explosion occurred, and the master
was watching the firing when he saw
a puff of smoke shoot through the top
of the turret. For two or three minutes
this continued, when there was a thud,
and the smoke ' became blacker and
thicker, followed by flames, which
burst through the turret and leaped
fifty feet into the air. Just before the
bursting out of the flames hg saw a
mangled body shoot up through the
turret and fall on the starboard side
of the Missouri.
Rear Admiral Rae, chief of the Bu
reau of Steam Engineering, said to'The
Call correspondent: "The bill recom
mended by the Secretary seems to pos
sess no objectionable points and it
widely supplements the present organ
ization without changing it. He is
given a course pt deliberate military
advice which he should have."
Rear Admiral Manney, chief of the
Bureau of Equipment, said: ,VThe Sec
retary should have a board of military
advisers. Such a board Is much supe
rior to advice from one man, because
It can give its entire attention to mili
tary questions and thoroughly consider
them before rendering' an opinion."
Admiral Dewey and Rear Admiral
Taylor, chief of the Bureau of Naviga
tion, will soon give the House "Naval
Committee their views on the subject.
Secretary Moody's suggestion has
found favor with most or the bureau
chiefs in the Navy Department. Hith
erto the officers have been looked upon
as opposed to the creation of a gen
eral staff because they feared it would
interfere with the administration of
their bureaus.
"WASHINGTON, April 15.â Secretary

they closed in on him and found that
he had chot himself through the head.
SHOOTING OF FUGITIVE.
The man was first seen just after
a freight train pulled into the Southern
Pacific station. When* Constable Bern

Bernstein. The officer then hastened
to telephone to the Sheriff's office and,
having secured a rifle, returned to find
the man. "When the officer reached the

Information received from the No

The Novosti has received a telegram
from Mrs. Vereshchagin, wife of the
painter, in Moscow, B stating that her
husband Is in Manchuria with the staff
of the commander in chief, but the pa
per, in printing the telegram, adds:
"Unfortunately this cannot be con
firmed." \
coincidence that the Petropavlovsk and
the. Pobieda "were struck simultaneous
ly seems to confirm the submarine the
ory, but it is not impossible that the
mines laid down by the Russians, or
by the Japanese during their last at
tack, drifted to the entrance of the
port, owing to the strong currents."
credit is decreasing and the industrial
crisis is becoming steadily more acute.
The steel and iron industries are para
lyzed. Thousands of workers are idle,
especially in Poland. There is much
distress among the cotton manufac
tories of Lodz, the coal mines of
Donetz and the mines of the Ural dis
tricts. Those workers are going to
starve sooner or later, unless some
thing heroic or unexpected be done.
"This situation delights the ad
vanced reformers and it Is difficult to
see how it can fail to produce a fresh
crop of anarchists and nihilists. The
storm, though black enough, may blow
over; but the authorities could not
well be confronted with a more
menacing outlook."

ST. PETERSBURG. April 15.â Out of
the maze of conflicting reports regard
ing the sequence of events leading to
the destruction of the Petropavlovsk,
it is now established that Vice Ad
miral Makaroff early on Wednesday
morning took out his squadron to en-
Ki'.ge a weak division of six Japanese
cruisers which appeared on the horizon
after the Japanese torpedo-boats which
sank the Bestrachni had been driven
off "by the Bayan. . Particulars of the
torpedo-boat fight are stiir lacking.
The Russian commander In chief pur
sued* the Japanese cruiser division un
til it was reinforced by eleven battle
ships, when he retired Into the outer
rcadstead. where he was drawing up
in line of battle when the disaster to
the Petropavlovsk occurred. The cir
cumstances of the destruction of .the
battleship are not known. It is cer
tain, however, that both her boilers and
magazines exploded, but it is not ab
solutely sure that she touched a mine,
although the weight of opinion at the
Admiralty is that such was the case,
and that, if so, it was' a Russian and
not a Japanese mine. A high official
of the Admiralty said:
"It is evident the powder magazine
exploded, because a jet of flame went
up with thÂ«> steam from the bursting
boilers. The magazine could not have
exploded spontaneously. The tempera
ture of a magazine is too closely
watched and the powder is stored so
as to render an explosion scarcely pos
sible. Doubtless a mine caused the
detonation of the powder and, torpedo
magazines. Perhaps the truth will
never be known, and the dip aster will
take a place with the countless other
mysteries of the sea."

pled and unable to shake off the Japan
ese attack. The Bayan drove the
enemy off. but the Bestrachnt ' sank at
7 a. m. The Japanese torpedo-boats
withdrew, but almost immediately six
Japanese warships appeared on the
horizon. Admiral Makaroff ordered the
squadron out to meet them and the
Japanese retired, but almost imme
diately reappeared, reinforced until the
fleet consisted of sixteen or seventeen
warsh-ps. The Russians put back to the
roadstead and formed a battle line,
when, at precisely 10 o'clock, with
out warning, the Petropavlovsk blew
up and ,sank. The Pobieda received a
breach amidships and retired to the in
ner harbor, where an examination
proved that her injuries were not very
serious. Besides Grand Duke Cyril, Cap
tain JakovleSf and Lieutenant Vakc-v
eky. Midshipmen Sylitte, Jenish and
Yukomleff were rescued. Reports as to
the number of seamen saved are con
flicting, one placing the number at
thirty-two and another at fifty-one.
They were rescued by the torpedo gun
boat Gaidamak. The cause of the de
struction of the Petropavlovsk has not
yet been ascertained.

gallery were of plain wood, except that
in the sections reserved for the diplo
matic corps and in the royal box there
were upholstered chairs. The room had
been finished in white that had turned
gray with age. The decorations were
gold and crimson. The Imperial party
did not leave the palace until 10:30
o'clock. The Crown Prince and other
Princes preceded the Emperor and
awaited him at the House of Lords.
The Emperor rode in a gorgeous car
riage, brilliant with red and gold,
drawn by the best pair of horses in
Japan. He had a very small guard of
lancers, mounted on the absurd little
Japanese ponies, which apparently no
amount of training will subject to the
discipline necessary for. good cavalry
horses. The consequence was that most
of the time there was very little of what
could be called formation among the
lancers. The Emperor was accompa
nied in his carriage by his chamber
lain. Prince Iwakura. Several other
court dignitaries preceded and followed
him in other carriages. Crowds lined
the streets through which the proces
sion passed.
THE E3IPEROR ARRIVES.
It was 11 o'clock before the members
of the House of Lords and the Com
mons began to file into the chamber.
Already the members of the diplomatic
corps had taken their places, and a
number of Japanese officers of high
rank, gorgeous in gold braid and many
decorations, had found places in the
gallery. The peers were for the most
part in. uniform splendid with gold
braid. The members of the Commons
were in clawhammer coats and white
ties. When all were in place the Cab
inet filed in and stood in the great bow
at the left and in front of the throne.
A few minutes later the door at the
opposite end of the platform opened
and the Emperor appeared. Instantly
every Japanese in the room made a
deep obeisance. The Emperor walked
quickly forward and ascended the steps
to the throne. From the gallery ho
seemed a large man for a Japanese, tall
and rather well made, but the brilliant
uniform he wore hung loosely upon
him, and no doubt has the effect of
making, him appear a bigger man phy
sically that he is. He did not sit dawn,
but remained standing, facing the mem
bers of Parliament, who stood with
heads bowed slightly forward. The
court party followed the Emperor and
stood on the platform at his right.
Count Katsura, the Prime Minister,
now stepped forward from the group
of Cabinet officers bearing in his hands
a large scroll, which he offered to the
Emperor. The Emperc took it and.
opening it, read, in the peculiar nasal
sing-song of the old Japanese style of
declamation, his address formally open
ing the session. During the five min
utes or so that it required every one

the close of the reading the Japanese
again made a deep obeisance. Then

guns, stepped forward from his place

TOKIO, Japan, March 20.â This morn
ing the Emperor formally opened the
new Diet, the legislative body that is
expected to indorse the imperial or
dinances which have been issued be
cause of the war, and to provide the
means for carrying on the struggle.
It Is a very different Diet from the
..contumelious body which celebrated its
brief existence In the closing days of
last year by an extraordinary parlia
mentary trick which resulted in the al
most unanimous adoption of a vote of
censure of the Government. But the
circumstances under which it meets
have also changed greatly,' and the ob
ject sought by the protest of its prede
cessor â war with Russia â has been at
tained. Now it only remains for the
present assembly to support loyally the
Government the other condemned, and
the indications are that it will do so
cheerfully. It has been borne in upon
the members of the new body that its
hearty co-operation with the Govern
ment is "the wish of the Emperor," and
in Japan, when it becomes known that
any particular thing is really "the
wish of the Emperor," that settles it.
SHARP PRACTICE IN THE DIET.
The vote of censure passed by the
last Diet was neatly obtained by sharp
practice on the part of a decided minor
ity. Many of the men who voted for it
did not know what they were support

clique which had formed a clever plan
to push through its scheme. A reply

BY OSCAR : KING DAVIS.
"Mr. President â Having received the
sad news of the loss of the battleship
Petropavlovsk, "which has cost so
many lives to our brave navy, I simul
taneously am informed of the disaster
which occurred on board your battle
ship, the Missouri, which took away so
many lives of your gallant sailors.
"Permit me to express to you, Mr.
President, my deep sympathy, in the
name of my Government and my own,
on this sad occurrence, which has deep
ly moved us all at a time when with
gjief we are mourning our own loss.
"Believe me, Mr. President, yours
very truly. CASSINI."
Count Cassini personally the re
gret of this Government has been ex
pressed at the death of Admiral Maka
roff and the officers and crew of the
Petropavlovsk. As the loss of the ship
and its crew . was an accident of war
the expression of this Government's re
gret was simply one of humanity,
without, reference to the differences
which are being fought out between
Russia and Japan.
NEW YORK. April 15.â The Ameri
can De Forest Wireless Telegraph Com
pany has telegraphed to Secretary Hay
at Washington a protest against the
attitude of the Russian Government
relative to the use of wireless telegra
phy by correspondents in the zone of
war. The protestants say:
"We claim the right under all inter
national laws to use the high seas for
peaceful purposes, and demand for our
operators, who are American citizens,
and for our property the full protection
of the United States Government."
The notice opens up an entirely new
line of treatment of correspondents.
The. reference to existing conventions
is taken to express the belief of the
Russian Government that if wireless
telegraphy had been practiced prior to
The Hague declaration concerning im
plements and practices of war it would
surely have been prohibited, even in
neutral hands. It happens that some
of the leading British newspaper cor
respondents are making free use of
the wireless telegraph in transmission
of their war news, and it is possible
that they will appeal to their Govern
ment to define their own status, and
to secure an official determination of
the question as to whether a neutral
on his own ship outside the territori.il
waters of a belligerent power and with
out contraband of war aboard can be
treated as a spy.
Among . the subjects considered to
day at the Cabinet meeting was the
substance of the communication re
ceived from the Russian Embassador.
In addition to this communication, the
President called attention >td the .mes
sages he had received from resident
Embassadc-rs regarding the accident on
the battleship Missouri. One of these
was received -last, evening, from Count
Cassini. Incidentally it refers to .the
loss of the Russian battleship Petro
pavlovsk off Port Arthur.
EXCHANGE OF CONDOLENCES.
Count Cassini's note is as follows: '
" 'In' a c^e in which neutral steam
ers having on board .. correspondents
who might communicate war news to
the enemy by means of perfected ap
paratlus not being yet foreseen by ex
isting conventions, would be arrested
near the coast of Kuantong or in the
zone of operations of the Russian fleet,
the correspondents ..will be looked
upon as spies, and the steamers fur
nished with wireless telegraphy seized
as prizes of war.' "
OPENS A NEW PROBLEM.
"I am charged by my Government,
in order to avoid all possible' misun
derstanding, to communicate to your
Excellency that the lieutenant of his
imperial. Majesty In the Far East lias
just made the following declaration:
WASHINGTON, April 15.â -The Rus
sian Government has given notice that
newspaper correspondents using wire
less telegraph will be treated as. spies
and shot. This notice was served upon
the State Department by Count Cas
sini, the Russian Embassador, 1 to-day,
and it is understood that similar com
munications were made to all foreign
offices. The text of the communica
tion is as follows: . Â¦
Neutral Nations
; May Not Ac
quiesce.
A dispatch from St. Petersburg to . a London newspaper reports a rumor there that a Japanese army
of 12,000 men, which landed west; of the Xalu River, has been crushed by the Russians, who effected a
surprise and drove the, brown troops back to their ships. Â¦
Russia objects to thd v sending; of press dispatches by wireless telegraphy from the war zone and
gives notice that correspondents; captnred , with evidence of ; the use of that system will be visited with the
treatment accorded spies. 1 The question raised by this attitude niay be warmiy debated before the neutral
powers accept the .Russian 'ruling., Â¦Â¦Â¦".: ; .
The palace of the Emperor of Korea in Seoul has been destroyed by fire, possibly of Incendiary origin.
Etiquette prevented the admission of a Japanese fire department to fight the flames, but French and British
marines, scoffing at Korean custom,, forced their way. into the sacred precincts and prevented a spread of
the flames to the foreign legations. ' â¢'â¢ Â¦-â¢Â¦' Â¦ - ' â¢ ' â¢ - --
Even hi Russia the belief is becoming general that the battleship Petropavlovsk was sunk and
the Pobieda . damaged, not by, derelict Russian mines, but by Japanese torpedo-boats or mines placed by the
Japanese at the" entrance; to < the harbor before the- Russians were lured out to offer battle. Japan de
nies the possession of any submarine boats, but from several quarters it is asserted that such craft are be
ing operated secretly by the Tokio naval board.
The identity of the Russian torpedo-boat destroyer sunk by the Japanese at Port Arthur on Wednes
day is in doubt. The Russian Government announces that it was tho.Strashni, while unofficial advices insist
that It was the Bestrachni, as at first reported.
Admiral- Togo bombarded Port Arthur yesterday morning; the firing continuing three hours. Seven
Chinese, were killed in the town and five soldiers and three Chinese wounded. The Kussians report no
damage; to the fortifications br ". the. "ships. It is" probable that Togo's operations are intended to cover a
landing of troops near Newchwang, the belief In St. Petersburg being that the Japanese will strike withont
delay, now that, the: Port Arthur fleet Is at .the mercy of the doughty admiral.

On Wednesday the varsity nins will

The varsity nine played gilt edge ball,
securing ten hits off the delivery oS
Merkle and McGregor, who occupied
the box for the visiting team. They
were debited with two errors, but these
came to them on hard chances.
The Mayer Brothers' team made elev
en errors, five of them in the fifth
inning, when five of the fifteen runs
were made by the varsity. Neither
Merkle npr McGregor was effective as
a pitcher, but the support they were
given would have discouraged the best

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April

baseball this afternoon the varsity

MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR IN THE
NATIONAL. LEGISLATURE. WHO
SPOKE AT BOSTON CONVENTION.
The statement printed abroad that
United States Embassador McCormlck 1
had been Instructed to make repre
sentations to the Government of Rus
sia concerning anti-Jewish demonstra
tions at Eastertide Is Incorrect. The
Embassador received no instructions
and made no representations. Exag
gerated reports of possible outbreaks,
printed abroad, have caused numerous
inquiries here, but the apprehensions
seem to. have been groundless, not a
single anti-Semitic demonstration hav
ing been reported since the holidays
began.
General Kuropatkin is concentra:!ng
his second line of defense' between
Mukden and Liaoyang. He will have
120,000 men there. by April 24.
The prevailing belief here is that the
Japanese will take advantage of the
situation to make a renewed attack
on Port Arthur, with 'the object of
sealing the entrance to the port, or,
considering the Russian fleet to be
practically immobilized by Its inferior
ity, proceed with the landing of troops
at the head of the gulf of Liaotung.
It Would not be surprising If the Jap
anese attempted to invest the fortress
of Port Arthur by land.
The latest rer>orts are to the effect
that the Japanese fleet is still in 'aight
from Golden Hill.
But such talk finds no cchojn re
sponsible quarters, where, indeed, it
i3 remarkable how calm and confident
the officials are that a change of for
tune will take place as soon as the
land operations begin in earnest.
EXPECT JAPANESE ACTIVITY.
As a result of the depressing influ
ence produced by the loss of the
Petropavlovsk, some pessimism, is
manifested, and in consequence - all
kinds of wild talk is heard. This is
not strange, considering the fatalism
inherent in the Russian character. As
an example, the specter of foreign
complications has appeared.
It is said that the*Petropaylovsk was
blown up by a submarine, boat sup
plied to Japan by Great Britain, which,
of course, would mean war with the
British. In furtherance of this *flea
it is pointed out that the British Par
liament has granted permission for
Indian troops to cross the frontier of
Tibet, whic,h naturally means only
that Great Britain is preparing to aid
her ally by advancing upon Central
Asia.
I Altogether ten Russian vessels have
been damaged or lost since the out
break of the war.
j, The disaster of "Wednesday ends the
j hope that the ill-fated Port Arthur
squadron would be able to become an
aggressive factor in the operations be
| fore it is reinforced by the arrival of
l the Baltic fleet. Until then the aim
of the Russians will be to hold Port
Arthur and conserve the remaining
ships within the protection of its guns.
Temporarily, the - least faith In suc
cess at sea died with Admiral Mak
aroff, and the Russian people now
look to the army, in which they have
implicit confidence, to retrieve on land
the reverses and distress suffered on
the water.
Viceroy Alexleff , . who was at Muk
den . when the disaster occurred, pro
ceeded promptly j to Port Arthur jj to
personally assume temporary com
mand of the naval forces .there, and
reached his distinction last night. His
presence is expected to put an end to
the demoralization there.
Besides the two battleships, the
other effective vessels at .Port Arthur
are the armored cruiser. Bayan, the
first-class cruisers Askold and Diana,
the second-class cruiser Novik, the tor
pedo gunboats Vzadnik and Gaidamak,
the gunboats Gremiaschchi, Otvashni,
Gillak and Bobr, the cruisers Djigit,
Bazboynik and Zabiyaka and the tor
pedo-boat destroyers, whose exact
number is not known.
TEX VESSELS OUT OF ACTIOX.
There are now only two undamaged
battleships, the Peresvlet and -the
Sevastopol, in the harbor at Port Ar
thur, but some of the' damaged vessels
have been repaired. Captain Jakov
leff is still alive, but his condition is
critical.

At a time when, to all appearances,
a considerable sentiment in the con
vention was with Fosf, Senator Lodge
took the platform and by an eloquent
address stemmed the tide and carried
tho delegates with him:
Foss, in offering his resolution, ar-
Srued that the Republican party in
Massachusetts was in danger of de
fpat unless something was done to save
it. He said that a decrease of five per
cent in the Republican vote of the
Ftate would place it in the Democratic
column, and he contended that Cana
dian reciprocity would avert this dan
ger. When he concluded he was ac
corded applause, hearty and prolonged.
Senator Lodge, supporting the plat
form reported by the resolutions com
mittee of the convention, urged har
mony and before he had been speating
a great while the audience was cheer
ing at almost every sentence.
When the chairman called for a vote
on the substitution of Mr. Foss' reci
procity plank, a few scattered voices
declared in favor of the substitution,
fcut when- the vote of those opposed
was railed a thunderous "no" shook
the walls of the auditorium. Immedi
ately afterward the original platform
vas adopted.
PLEA OF MR. FOSS.
Mr. Foss made his plea for a recip
rocity plank yesterday before the
committee Â«n resolutions. The result
was not satisfactory to him and he de
dared he would carry the matter be
fore tho convention. In this connec
tion also he demanded that the Aus
tralian ballot he used in voting f*r del
t ..rates-ai-large. Opposed to Mr. Foss
on the reciprocity question are Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge and the State com
mittee, while his opponent as candi
date for rtripgate-at-large was Colonel
K. C Bectou <if Be&nonL
The genera! feeling before the con
vention seemed to be that Foss would
lÂ»o defeated and that the delegatcs-at-
Jnrge named by the State committee.
Senator Lodge, former Governor Win
throp Murray Crane, former Governor
Jthn D. Long and Colonel Benton,
would be chosen.
When the convention had been called
t<> <>rdor by Major Thomas Talbot. the
temporary chairman. Attorney General
Herbert Parker was introduced as per
manent chairman. 'Mr. Parker made
an address which occupied an hour in
its delivery, and then the platform was
presented.
The principles of reciprocity as enun
ciated in thÂ« national Republican plat
form of 1S00 are reafihmed. On this
subject thf- resolutions say further:
"Every effort to that end has hither
to been made by the Republican party.
Reciprocity with Canada is a mere
phrase until the concessions offered on
Â«â¢!!Â«â¢ side and demanded on the other
are stated in detail. No administration
imd no party can legislate or negotiate
n mere catchword into substance.
Those who demand reciprocity with
Canada should furnisb details if they
desire action, always remembering
that no trade can be a good trade un
]r-Fs both parties are benefited there
by."
COMMENDATION OF ' COXGRESS.
The administration and Congress arc
commended for having assured the
construction of the Panama canal. The
Sherman anti-trust law under a Re
publican executive has b^en tested and
enforced, and "the fact established
that no condition detrimental to the
public welfare can arise under a peo
ple's government that cannot be
checked by Congressional legislation."

vention had announced his intention
cf offering a reciprocity resolution and
of contesting as a candidate for dele
pate at large on this issue, carried out
his plan, llis resolution was over
whelmingly voted down and he was
rejected as a delegate by a vote of ITS

"Dimond proposes to clear himself by

since the dawn of Anglo-Saxon juris

""If such a rule exists." Heney retort^
ed, "no attorney, is safe In dealing, with

Wheeler declaring that Dimond did not

client, but adding, "I propose to go
fully into the whole connection between

"I object," shouted McEnerney of
counsel for the other defendant, Hyde.
"This is a privileged communication
from client to attorney and must not
be disclosed."

"Did you know that Hyde and Ben

est reserve lieu land interests?" asked
Charles S. Wheeler, Dimond's attorney.
"Just before I left for .Washington,"
the witness began his answer, "Mr.

He said in part
Dimond did not reach this part of
his story yesterday,, but when he re
turns to the stand on Monday morning
he will declare that his visit to Benson
was in relation to a matter # in which
he was acting as attorney for the land
speculator, and which is not included
in the indictment; that when Benson
heard a k.nock on his door he said to
Dlmond, "Please step into the bath
room a second until I get. rid of this
visitor," and that the lawyer did so
without knowing that Benson's caller
was an employe of the Interior Depart
ment with whom it was irregular to
have secret dealings.
Dimond's testimony was delivered in
a straightforward manner and covered
the greater part of the evidence in
volving his name that has been given
by the Grand Jury witnesses who have
been put on the stand by the defense.
EXPLAINS BATHROOM STORY.
.Henry "P. Dimond, the San Francisco
attorney who is one of the defendants
In the land fraud case, took the stand
in his own behalf yesterday before
United States Commissioner Heacock
and denied 1 in detail any complicity In
the alleged illegal operations of Fred
erick A. Hyde and John A. Benson and
any" knowledge of the conspiracy,
charged in the indictment found by the
Federal Grand Jury at Washington,
D. C. Dimond's testimony, which was
not completed â¢ when court adjourned,
is understood to be preliminary to a
motion by his counsel to dismiss the
complaint as to him. This motion may
be made on. Monday, unless the cross
examination of the witness by Gov
ernment Counsel Heney should prove
unexpectedly long. and severe.
Before . Dimond leaves the witness
stand he will admit tftat he was the
mysterious man behind the door of
Benson's bathroom at the time Wood
ford D. Harlan of the General Land
Office visited the well-known "scrip
per." This visit occurred in Benson's
parlors at the Willard Hotel in Wash
ington during May, 1902. Harlan al
leged In hi? testimony on Thursday
that Benson told him he had an agent
in the bathroom whom he wanted him
to meet, and that on his refusing to
deal with more than one man in the
sale of Government secrets- Benson had
asked him to step Into a clothes closet,
while he let his bathroom guest out
into the hall.
. Consideration of the general deficien
cy appropriation bill was resumed in;
the House to-day after a number of
minor r bills had been passed. Tha
President's recent order regarding ser
vice pensions was attacked by Under
wood of Alabama, who contended that
there was no warrant in law for it.
The President also was criticized by
Hay of Virginia h. cause of certain,
suspensions of the civil service rules
and regulations. General debate on the
deficiency bill will close to-morrow and
the bill will be read for amendment.
"You might have some one in.. the
Senate ask the Postmaster General
what members of Congress recom
mended their appointments." remarked
Bailey, and a laugh was provoked at
this Indirect reference to . the recent
controversy In the House.
At -5: 40 the Senate adjourned.
Hale interrupted Bailey with the
statement that he fully agreed with
ir.uch that the Texan had said, yet, he
added, it was impossible to get a
change because of the unwillingness of
Congress to put itself on record. He
called attention to the fact that when
ever there was a rolicall on the sub
ject in the House of Representatives it
failed to sustain other votes 'against
the civil service system. In view of
this fact, be asked, "Does the Senator
from Texas think there is the slightest
chance for a change?"
Bailey replied that he did not think
there was. and Hale said: * j/:
"Is there not a eort of pall resting'
on Congress which prevents its ex
pressing its conviction as to what
Ehould.be done?" '.
Galli nger, asked concerning executive
orders ' creating civil . service positibns
for many hundred employes in the
rural, deli very service.
"I believe." he said flatly, "that to
the victors the spoils belong, and if
1 had rrv way under a Republican ad
ministration I would not allow a Dem
ocratic indorsement to be filed; nor
would I. as a Democrat, permit the
filing of a Republican indorsement un
der a Democratic administration."
He added that he would ask no fa-,
vors of political em-mies, and said that
if such favors were granted he would
not thirk much of those who granted
them, as he would know that they
would expect favors in return.
He had no complaint, he declared,
that the Republicans now appoint their
partirans. He did complain when there
were violations of the law under
the political dilettantism connected
with the service under present condi
tions. There never had been more
scandals in the departments than since
the present system was inaugurated,
he said, and if the Republicans had
been able to turn, the Democratic ras
cals out of office when they took con
trol of the Government they would not
be able to plead even' time the Post
oifice scandal was mentioned that one
of the chief offenders had been la Dem
ocrat. Partisanship, he went on, never
ran too high to suit him, provided it
was intelligent enough to discriminate.
He predicted that if the present sys
tem should be continued the country
would soon have a civil' pension list.
HALE COINCIDES.
SPOILS FOR THE VICTORS.
The sundry civil appropriation bill
was taken up and when the Senate
adjourned about half of it had been
read. There was no debate until the
amendment authorizing the Secretary
of the Interior to appoint agents for
the protection of public timber, "with
out regard to party affiliation," was
reached. Gorman made an inquiry
concerning the civil service feature of
the provision, whereupon Bailey made
an attack upon practices under the
civil service law. He spuke of the civil
service requirement as a "dreamâ an
Iridescent dream," and added the con
viction that "the present President had
suspended the civil service law in order
to make political appointments more
times than all of his predecessors."
He then announced himself a spoils
man, and said that he delighted in it,
adding that he never had been able
to attain the intellectual enthusiasm
of those who would entirely disasso
ciate an applicant firr office from politi
cal conviction.
Hale was In accerd with much that
Bailey said, but thought that Congress
could not be induced to change the law.
even though convinced that it should
be changed.
The Panama canal bill occupied the
major portion of the day and was
passed without division.
Spooner made a vigc-rous speech In
support of the bill, and was replied to
by Morgan.
CIVIL SERVICE A DREAM. . .
WASHINGTON, April 15.â After a
day devoted to routine proceedings, the
Senate was treated to a spirited speech
by Bailey Just before adjournment on
the question of civil service. The sub
ject came up in connection with a
paragraph in the sundry civil appro
priation bill. Bailey announced in
plain terms that he had no sympathy
with the iridescent dream of civil ser
vice. . He declared that each party
should control the patronage while "In
power, and avowed himself a spoils
man.

Enerney's objection was again em
phatic, but the Government'attorneys
laughed. * ir "
"Mr. McEnerney doesn't mean to ob
ject," said Heney; "he is only making
a little stage play. But we object to
the introduction of the letter as a self
serving declaration. Wheeler is trying
to get on the record a lot of innocent
professions." The letter was excluded,
as were many other documents of a
similar purport offered later.
Dimond's examination proceededs He
declared that he had had no knowledge
of the methods by which Hyde ac
quired his lieu "bases," the State
school lands which the Government
charges were obtained from Oregon
and California by forgery. He had re
mained in Washington much longer
than he expected, but he neveY learned
that any clerks in the General Land
Office were receiving money from Ben -
Bon or Hyde. All his work there was of
a routine character, bringing him in
contact with the Commissioner and
rarely with any of the clerks. He had
entered appearances in many of the
Hyde selections, but never discovered
that any of them, were based on fraud
ulent titles.. In fact the only questions
raised by the department against these
claims were as to unpaid taxes on
some of the base lands and other
minor defects that .were easily cured.
He had never conveyed to Benson or
Hyde any information received from
a Government employe.
The only matter in which he had
ever represented Benson, the witness
said, was that of the San Francisco
Mountains Forest' Reserve in Arizona,
in which Benson got the agency for
the sale of 28,000 acres of lieu lands
for the Aztec Land and Cattle Com
pany, a New York corporation. Â¦ This
transaction Is not Involved' in the in
dictment. It kept the witness in Wash
ington until June, 1902, after the bath
room incident.
At this, point the hour for adjourn

MRS. I CURTIS ONCE MORE.
Earlier In the day -Mrs.-. Belle.; A.
Curtis had been recalled 'by McEnerney
and Questioned briefly but inconclu
sively regarding the Hyde-Benson
pooling â¢ Â« agreement. Then Samuel
Knight of Dimond's counsel asked her
whether she had ever had in her pos
session, while she was Hyde's stenog
rapher, any instrument relating-to lieu
land selections, which she knew was
forged. .This brought out some^ new
testimony to the following effect*

court, of inquiry to examine into the
cause of the explosion on the battle

thirty-two officers and men lost their
lives, reconvened on the battleship to
day after an adjournment yesterday to
attend the funeral services. Admiral
Coghlan of the Caribbean squadron is
president of the court, and the mem
bers of the court have been selected,
as far as possible, from vessels of other
squadrons. It is not expected, how
ever. : by those who are familiar with
the circumstances, that the court will
recommend any proceedings in the
case, inasmuch as those who are pre
sumed- to be at fault were the turret
olHcers. and they were killed by the
explosion. The bodies of the victims
are being 3ent away as fast as their
relatives make the requests. It is ex
pected that some of the sixteen bodies
interred yesterday will be .disinterred.
There are no developments to-day ex

ance of A. W. Boughard, a seaman
who was In the turret. Two seamen
who were on the afterdeck say they
saw a man's body blown through the

In addition to the constabulary the

FAMOUS CONSTABULARY BAND.
The famous Constabulary band ac
companies this 'sample of the Insular
Government's protective arm. Lieuten
ant W. H. Loving, the chief bandmas
ter and the man responsible for his
musicians' wonderful execution, is a
crinkle-haired negro Just brimming
over with martial melody. He is a
graduate of the Boston Conservatory
of Music and in the Far East has won
notable fame as a conductor. In the
band are eighty-three pieces, and, in
the words of Captain Peabody, the
Sheridan's commander, "it's the rlp
roaringest orchestra that ever blew sea
ajr through brass."
It was only at Honolulu and Naga
saki, however, that those who had not
made the band's acquaintance in Ma
nila learned anything of its quality.
Although good musicians, the bands
men were bad sailors. Seasickness
played no favorites with the natives.
They air succumbed and nearly all the
time the transport was at sea 280 dusky
constables suffered the dismal tortures
of marine biliousness and in groaning
heaps lay about the trooner's decks
like a bunch of sick monkeys. The Fil
ipinos came up from the transport in
bunches of twenty, and thirty last. night
and .were landed '."by cars at the
corner of Third . and Market streets.
They gazed around in great amaze
ment at the whirl and buzz of the city,
and were especially interested in the
electric light display. They looked at
the towering Call building with ad
miration and delight.
CONSTABULARY OFFICERS.
; Among the . passengers who arrived
here yesterday on the army transport

The Robinson estate Is the cause of
the trouble that led to the filing by
Attorney George D. Collins of charges
against Judge Kerrigan of the Supe
rior Court and the commencement of
disbarment procedings against Col
lins by the Hibernia Bank. C. W. Pur
rington, former administrator of the
estate, was removed by Judge Coffey
on complaint of the bank for "grave
neglect" of his duties.
Judge Coffey decided yesterday that
corporations, except those acting un
der the statute providing for trust
companies, cannot act as administra
tors of estates, and refused to grant
the petition of the Hibernia Bank for
letters of administration upon the es
tate of Caroline Robinson. He de
cided that such corporations cannot
nominate an administrator, and re
fused to grant the bank's request to
appoint Public Administrator M. J.
Hynes. Both petitions were filed to
forestall the efforts of Charles Robin
son to secure the appointment of ad
ministrator. The bank will now op
pose Robinson's apolntment on the
ground that he is unworthy.

District Attorney Byington said the

Mrs. Botkin will appear in Judge
Cook's court this morning to be formal
ly sentenced to imprisonment for life
for the murder of Mrs. Dunning. Her
attorneys will make a motion for a new
trial, which may delay the pronouncing
of the sentence.
The preliminary examination of Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin on the charge of mur
dering Mrs. Ida Henrietta Deane by
sending Mrs. Dunning, her sister, a box
of poisoned candy to Dover, Del., in
August, 1E98, was continued before Po
lice Judge Conlan yesterday, but noth
ing sensational developed! The defend
ant was alert yesterday. She had on
the table before her a transcript of
the testimony taken at her recent trial
before a Jury in Judge Cook's court,
and she followed closely the testimony
of the witnesses yesterday and several
times prompted her attorney.
When the case was called Attorney
Reese Clark surprised the District At
torney and the Judge by saying: "I
want subr>enas for the three witnesses
examined yesterdayâ Miss Lizzie L..
Kemp, Miss Josephine Bateman and
Hany C. Pennlngton. I will require
them for the defense."
"That's your own business," quietly
replied the Judge, who ordered the Dis
trict Attorney to call the next witness.
Three witnesses were examined yes
terdayâMiss Leila Deane, daughter of
Mrs. Deane; M4sÂ«- Ethel J. Mllllngton
and Dr. L. H. Bishop. Miss Deaije ate
one of the candles and was sick. Miss
Milllngton had a similar experience
and Dr. Bishop was called in to attend
the members of the Pennington house
hold when the poison began to take
effect. Their testimony was the same
as at the Dunning trial. The case will
proceed on Monday morning.
Attorney Clark, explaining his object
In subpenaing the witnesses, said he
had been placed at a disadvantage^in
cross-examining them owing to the
Jumbled manner in which the tran
script of the testimony at the Dunning
trial was jnade, and he had missed sev
eral important points favorable to the
defendant. He could not recall them
for further cross-examination, and he
had no other recourse but to subpena
them. He declared he was acting in
good faith and meant to subpena every
witness.

ant, in the slow, measured tone that
suggests pulse-counting, "I was struck
upon the head by an unseen robber at
Fourth and Brannan streets;- and since
then I have been subject to lntermit
ten attacks of torpor."
"I think about ten days in a quiet
cell, with no liqucr obtainable, would
restore you to old-time. immunity from

clerk will write out the prescription."

cash to spending it for luxuries.
"How would three months In the
County Jail suit your Idea of . econ
omy?" was the court's considerate
query.
"Oh, I guess I could get along there
all right," was Mary's answer.
She is there. .
mented the court, admiringly.
"Well," said Mr. Cameron, "I didn't
go to South Africa for fun."
Two policemen testified that one
evening not long ago they were called
upon by neighbors of Mr. Cameron,
who resides way out Point Lobos ave
nue, with a reeuest that he be re
strained from shattering the peace of
the neighborhood. When they ap
proached the dwelling of the offender,
which is on the side of a steep hill,
he ascertained they had no warrant,
and then bade them begone and fired
three shots. They retired, to devise
legal ways and means of storming the
domiciliary fortress, but when they at
last scaled the heights the defender of
the garrison had fled. He came down
town the next morning and surren
dered himself into custody, and in court
yesterday he denied haying aimed at
the invaders and proved that when the
shots were fired they were at least
seventy-five yards from his house. So
that charge was dismissed.
Then an inn-ke*Der named M. Mars
ton took the stand *rd complained that
on a separate occasion the same de
fendant had presented a pistol at his
body and threatened to shoot him be
cause he (the* witness) had expostu
lated against the rough manner In
which the defendant rode a horse at
him. To this charge Mr. Cameron
pleaded that he had simply "blufCed"
Mr. Marston by pulling frtnn his pock
et a monkey-wrench in a menacing
way, because he thought Mr. Marston
intended to assault him.-
Mr. Marston smiled Ironically at this
defense, and said to the defendant,
"Cameron, you are a good man with a
durned bad temper, and you know you
are."
"And you," retorted Mr. Cameron,
"would be a better man if you didn't
drink so much of your stock-in-trade."
Mr. Marston's quickly framed retort
was never uttered, for the Judge ab
ruptly dismissed that case, also.
W. J. Cameron, of shrewd eye and
military mien, recounted some of his
exploits as a volunteer in the Boer
army during the late unpleasantness
In the Transvaal, and Judge Cabaniss
listened attentively to the recital, which
was incidental to Mr. Cameron's de
fense on charges of carrying concealed
weapons and threatening to slay. .
"In three months I killed many hun
dred bloody Saxons," he stated with
due modesty. *S
"And that was going some," com-
"I dinna ken," replied Defendant
Burns, who looked as sheepish as the
carcasses he had purloined.
"Aweel, aweel," sighed the court, "I
hardly ken what tae dae wuth ye. an'
Meesther Stairk till I find oot some
thin* mair aboot the pair o' ye, sae
I'll e'en contlnny the case till the mor
row's morn."
"I can appreciate the hereditary! in
stinct that prompted ,yo,u, Robert
Burns, to 'lift* the mutton," said his
Honor, who Is 'a voracious ' reader of
Crockett and Stevenson, "for in- your
veins courses the blood that in- the
lang syne ran red in the clans of
Burns, famed for Its raids upon the
fleeced flocks that ranged the border
hills. The illustrious poet whose name
you bear has sung of those brave ex
ploits. May I ask if you are a direct
descendant of that Immortal bard?"
Sheep stealing Is such an innovation
In San Francisco's criminal happen
ings that Judge Mogan glared Incred
ulously at Clerk Gray when that func
tionary announced it as the charge
against Robert Burns and Frank Stack.
But the prosecuting testimony proved
conclusively that at an early hour yes
terday morning the defendants, who
are men of the sea, did feloniously
carry away two defunct bleaters from
the meat market" of Mr. Shenson,' 955%
Folsom street, and .deposit the: same
in an adjacent hallway,' whence they
were emerging when caugnt by a vig
ilant patrolman. â¢ In defense â¢ the Â¦ two
mariners pleaded that they were In
toxicated and did not know what they
had done while in that condition until
they recovered their senses and found
themselves In prison. The policeman
also said they were drunk when he
took them in. â¢ -, .

. Announcement was made to the City
Council to-night that the deadlock over
the appointment of a board of arbi
tration to fix the valuation of the Con
tra Costa Water Company's plant had
been broken. President : George "W.
Dornin said difficulties had been ad-
Justed between the special Council com
mittee and the water company's repre
sentatives, and that the committee
would report Monday night to the
Council on Its plan and the name of the
experts to represent the city and the
water company.
Councilman Cuvellier added a de
tailed statement of the situation. He
said the conferences of the committee
and the water company people up to
last Monday night had been unproduct
ive of results, because they could not
agree on the programme to be fol
lowed by the board of arbitration nor
to the instructions to be submitted to
the experts. Later conferences had
led to concessions on the part' of
the water company, a fair' ground of
operations had been established, and
the way had been cleared for speedy
organization of the board.
"In 'view of Councilman Dornin and
Councilman Cuvellier's explanations,
the Council to-night postponed further
inquiry in the' matter -of' water rates
,flxing until April 25, the next regular
meeting night of the committee of the
whole.

Dr. Abbott's last plea was for more
conscientious and self-sacrificing citi
zenship among ail classes of citizens.
It is the duty of university men to help the
Christianize this country; to see to It that our
revercne* for the law become* deeper and
Bounder; to see to It that the strife between
capital 8nd labor Is abated. Whether you
like the dutie* that our tremendous progress
has placed upon you. It ir certain we can never
po berk. The question is not "Shall we be
ccme a world power and take part In world
affair*?" We are already the first world
jx,wrr. The quertlon now Is, "How shall we
urc the power that our position has given us?"
Now. what do all these present day condi
tions mean to you men of th* university? Our
development has be*n unprecedented and
whether this development will prove a peril
or a blcrnlng will depend upon the men and
women who make up the nation. America â
and I wr>eak plainlyâ Is not entirely civilized.
A Government that allows come of Its post
office officials to go wrong, a Government -that
puts into its Legislatures men whow role am
bition in to thrust their arms deeo into the
public treasury, la not wholly civilised. A
country in which capital and labor are clutch-
Ing each other by the throat Is not civilized.
Let us not shut our eyes to this peril; let us
realize that a Government divided against
itself cannot stand. I cannot speak for your
oltj'. but 1 know what they are doing In New
York and Chicago. I hope you are all faints
In Kan FranclFco. but I doubt it. | America
rrally need" mrre good men.
Dr. Lyman Abbott, edUor of the Out
look and the E. T. Earle lecturer for
ISO* for the Pacific Theological Sem
inary, is an optimist of the most pro
nounced type. The material welfare of
the people of America interests him
quite as much as their spiritual wel
fare, and he calls their country the
greatest world power. Yet he sees
peri! in this very puissance and
prays that it may be counterbalanced
by a little more spirituality, "a little
more reverence for religion and a little
more respect for the law."
. Dr. Abbott's opinions were laid be
fore a thousand students of the Uni
versity of California through the me
dium of an address this morning in
Harmon gymnasium. Dr. Abbott first
traced the rapid development of Amer
ica within the past decade, and paint
ed an encouraging picture v of its fu
ture and then said:

OAKLAND. April 15. â Abe Swin
tkey, a young man who says he is a
graduate of the University of Chicago,
was sentenced by Judge Hall to-day to
four years In Folsom prison for hav
ing passed three fictitious checks, one
on A. C. Poole. another on L. Schwartz
and the third on Morris Isaacs. He
pleaded guilty to the charges.
In a plea for clemency Swinskey
told Judge Hall that his people were
well thought of in Chicago and he did
not want them to hear of hi* trouble.
He said he held a decree from the
University of Chicago and that he had
never been in trouble before. He said
he lost his money in San Francisco
playing faro bank and came over to
Oakland to raise money for his im
mediate wants by means of the
checks. They were for $10 each.

Childs was held to answer* by Justice
Cone on the' specific charge of hav
ing burglarized the residence of Mn>.
A. Â¦ M. Lusk, 1617 Clinton avenue, . on
February ll J .
"I got/ a 'split 1 on what I disposed
cf," explained Morton, "and never in
quired of Childs or Baldwin whether
they stole the goods or bought them.
I knew that Childs 'worked* Alameda
and that Baldwin 'worked* Oakland."
Morton testified that he first met
Childs in San Quentin. The (Jnly ques
tion asked by Childs of Morton' while
the latter was on the stand was, "Was
then* not something strange about
that meeting in San Quentin?". -
Morton paid that he remembered that
Childs gave him certain papers' at. the
time, but did not consider the trans
action strange.
MADE XO INQUIRY.
"Childs, Baldwin and I had an un
derstanding," said Morton to- Chlet
of Police John Conrad, in explaining
why he had turned against his pals,
"that whoever would 'go up against It'
first, the others were to hire for him
a 'mouthpiece/ or attorney. I wait
ed for five weeks after being arrested,
and never once openea my head. Thcs 1 ;
other fellows in that time did not even
send me a cigarette, and no lawyer
came to help me out of Jail. I have
grown tired of such ingratitude, and
will tell all I know about the criminal
work of Childs and Baldwin."
Morton related on the fitand, in
answer to questions put him by Deputy
District Attorney W. .H. 12 Hynes, how
Childs and Baldwin would visit' Ala
meda and Oakland, loot residences and
return to San Francisco. They woulu
turn the goods over to Morton, who
said it was "not good etiquette for
one thief to ask another where he got
the stuff."
Morton was arrested six weeks ago
in San Francisco and brought to this
city on a charge of having ransacked
the home of Gus Koch, 1315 San An
tonio avenue.
Morton, Childs and Baldwin were
members of a gang of San Francisco
housebreakers and robbers, and all
were taken into custody for numerous
thefts of jewelry and silverware in this
city and Oakland. Morton is known
as the "lesral burglar," by reason of
his knowledge of the law; and Childs,
who has but one arm, is known as the
"burglar with the bloody hand," be
cause of his method of breaking in
doors and windows and usually leaving
traces of his gore about the premises.
RANSACKS KOCH HOME.
ALAMEDA. April 15.â Neglect shown
him by his pals in crime after he had
been arrested and Imprisoned caused
Kdwnrd Morton, an ex-convict charged
with burglary, to turn on Harry Childs
and Harry Baldwin; also accused of
burglary, durir.g the preliminary hear
ing of Childs before Justice of the
Peace F. S. Cone to-day.
Morton said that had the other al
leged thieves "done the right thing"
with him he would willingly serve ten
or even twenty years in prison before
he would testify against them. Be
cause he believes that Childs and Bald
win broke their word cf honor with
him Morton turned State's evidence
and now wants to see both of his for
mer companions given the limit of the
law.- - i

111S Broadway. April 15.
Mr. Cooley next read a letter from
former Governor Taft of the Philip
pines in reply to the President's in
quiry regarding the civil service sys
tem in -the islands and his opinion upon
it. In this letter Mr. Taft advocated
an extension of the system.
"The Civil Service Commission needs
the co-operation of the people," con
cluded Mr. Cooley, "else the extension
of the system will hot be as gratifying
as it ha* been."
The system does no morn to'create an offlce
hotding class than does the Southern Pacillc
Company or any other great employing syÂ«
tem. It Is simply the common sense way of
engaging men who will give the Government
efllcient service. .Â¦ '. >~V: ":
The candidate for a scientific place Is not
examined afall. His degrees are sufficient
for the commission. All the system aims to
do Is to satisfy itself that the men are quali
fied for the position to which they aspire.
Another criticism is that the system creat'S
an offlce-Beeklnjr class. I don"t know exactly
what that means, but I presume that It 'â¢
burn of a. protest against some men holding
office for life. But that â¢ is where the power
of the thin* lies. If men could be removed
It- would be the sdoIIs system again. . It Is
designed to prevent removals of an arbitrary
kind. x .
DEGREES ARE SUFFICIENT.
There are many criticisms of the system.
It does not come from the men working under
It, but from the theorist*. One' of the mout
Useful to these theorists Is that the system
of examinations Is not practical. But I think
that It Is as practical as It may be. For
every position special attention ia Riven to
their Importance and the examinations fixed
accordingly. If a man wishes to be a Janitor
no educational qualification In required. All
that Is required of him Is good hralth and a
decent knowledge of a building. For a rail
way mall clerk only the most elementary edu
cational qualification is demanded. The can
didate murt be In good health because tho
character of the work he Is about to under
take demands It.
. The principles of the law were, re
viewed by Mr. Cooley at some length.
THe most valuable of these, he said,
is that which prevents the coersion of
men in the service for political rea
sons; another is that which demands
that the examinations shall be prac
tical in their character; still another
is that which requires that a candi
date for a permanent position shall be
received only on probation until he ha3
proved his fitness for his trust. In part
Mr. Cooley said: .
The civil 'Ben-Ice law allows for an Increase
In the number of offices under - Ha control.
There were only .thirteen offices within tha
jurisdiction of the - commission when It waa
founded, but' now, as you know; It extends to
roost of the subordinate office* In the land. - d
The commission" ftruggled along with fair
success until 1889. when Theodore Rooeevclt
was appointed a member of the commission.
and then It fairly Jumped ahead. It was
recognlied that he was a man of power and
under him the scope of the work Increased.
Mr. Roosevelt was for the enforcement of the
law above everything else and he law that
U did not become a dead letter.
BERKELEY, April 15.â Alford .. W.
Cooley, one of the two members of. the
United States Civil Service Commis
sion, addressed a gathering of faculty
men . and students \ in ! the observatory
building at the University of Califor
nia this afternoon,: on "Civil Service
Reform:" Mr. Cooley spent a half hour
deaiing with -the history and econom
ical value of that interesting system
and went away .frc-m a room ringing
with applause for his clear, exposition
of the subject.
"Mr. Cooley 's first task was- to show
the development* of the -'system from
the beginning, then to treat of its
workings and finally to deal yvith its
enemies and critics. George Washing
ton) he said, was the first man to for
mulate the first civil service rule. This
he did by refusing to continue the
spoils system of the English, against
which the colonies had revolted. With
out any statutes to demand it, men
were appointed upon their merits until
Jackson's time, when the spoils sys
tem returned with all Its corruption
and viciousness. Then it was that the
victor began to share in the spoils.
The victor shared in the spoils until
1881, when the first civil service law
was passed. Attempts had been made
in the interim to secure the adoption
of the reform, but it failed until Presi
dent Garfield was assassinated by an
office seeker. Â¦' Then, in' answer to the
demands of the country, the present
law was passed.- " ''

The- children and heirs of the tes
tator are Lydia J. Thomas, Annie R.
I^ey, Ellen McFadden and Sarah A.
Dean. They purpose giving their step
mother a battle royal in case she car
ries out her threat of attempting to set
aside the will of their late father.
In his will the testator affirms that
all of his property. is separate prop
erty, it having been accumulated by
him prior to his last marriage, and it
is to this clause that the children
point for a Justification of their re
fusal to give up any of their share of
the estate. / : 'Â¦ '?Â¦Â¦? Â¦Â¦*Â¦*Â¦ Â¦'-
Sarah A. ! yDean . and Jessie H.
Thomas were given special letters of
administration on the. estate to-day by
Judge Greene. In their petition they
set forth that the widow is riot satis
fied with her share and has threatened
suit unless she is given a third; that it
will probably be a long time before
matters are settled and that in the
meantime the estate needs attention.
Upon this showing the letters were
issued.
Mrs. Sarah L. Bump has disregarded
the wish of her deceased husband.
Nelson Bump, as expressed in his will,
and' has threatened the other heirs
with a will contest unless she is given
a third of the. estate, valued at $200,
000. Mrs.. Bump was decedent's sec
ond wife and was left the family resi
dence aX 918 Chester street and $5000,
while the bulk of the estate was left
to the four daughters of Bump by his
first wife. The deceased particularly
states in his will, as if he anticipated
trouble over the division he had made
of the property, that if Mrs. Bump
should bring legal proceedings to set
aside his will she should be disin
herited entirely.

Attorney Creely said the next step
would be an appeal to the Superior
Court and thence, if necessary, to thÂ«i
Supreme Court. Police Judge Mor
timer Smith will bear a number of
scavengers' cases to-morrow in his de
rartmenL
Police Judge George Samuels to-day
sustainrd the validity of the garbage
crematory ordinance by an opinion
overruling a demurrer to the com
plaints sworn out against a number of
scavengers that were arrested on a
charge of Illegally collecting garbage.
This'onlnicn is the starting point of
a test of the law which will be carried
to the Supreme Court of the State in
behalf of the Scavengers' Union.
For the scavengers. Attorney J. H.
Creely argued on his demurrer that
the ordinance granting exclusive
rights to the Pacific Incinerating Com
rany. to handle the garbage was un
constitutional in that it Invaded pri
vate rights and deprived persons of
their "property. He claimed that the.
City Council had acted in excess of its
police powers in passing the ordi
nance.
Attorney L. S. Church, representing
the crematory company, maintained
that the council, in matters affecting
public sanitation and health, had very
Inroad powers and that it had full war
rant to prohibit or to regulate a busi
ntss that misht become a menace to
public health or might become a pub
lic nuisance.
His Honor upheld the right of the
City Council to enact the law.

a very large . tree, about, sixty feet long and
four feet In diameter, surmounted by a large
bunch of roct* and branches of trees, between

J. C. BURNETT,
Lieutenant, U. S. N., in charge.
The Oceanic Steamship* Company's
liner Mariposa, Captain Rennie. arrived
yesterday from Tahiti with twenty
eight passenger? and nearly 600 tons of
cargo. She made the run from Papeete
fn eleven days and nineteen hours.
Most of the passengers had been to (he
South Seas in search of health and re
laxation from business, and none
looked as if the trip had been made in
vain. Among the passengers was L. M.
Thornton, an 'employe of the British
Government in India, who is returning
to England on a six- months' leave of
absence. J. C. Buckingham, another
passenger, is one of the most Invet
erate globe-trotters that ever stretched
himself in a steamer chair. He has
been traveling for the last twenty years
and in that time has- visited, literally,
ail the ends of the earth. In all his
wanderings, he gays, the journey he en
joyed best was the voyage Just ended.
Rev. G. Dowling of Los Angeles was
another passenger. With his daughter,
he made the round trip on the Mari
posa.
Seymour R. Church of this city, who
was a passenger on the Mariposa from
here and who is spending several
months at Papeete, created great ex
citement among the islanders with the
aid of a phonograph. He took with
him several hundred records of all
sorts of sounds, ranging from the sing
ing of Melha to the barking of the
Cliff House seals. Attached to the
phonograph was a megaphone of heroic
dimensions, which magnified the sound
to a great volume. Every evening after
dinner during the Mariposa's stay at
the South Sea port Church mounted
the bridge deck, pointed his megaphone
shoreward and turned loose the phon
ograph. The natives flocked to the
liner's side from all parts of the isl
and, and from 7:30 o'clock until mid
night the M.ariposa'8 quartermasters
were kept busy holding back the dusky
populace.
Governor Cor readjusted the execu
tive dinner hour so that he could at
tend, the Church concerts. As news of
the Mariposa's cargo of song traveled
through the island the nightly audience
Increased, and so infatuated did
Church become with this novel sport
that he hired a wagon and the day the
Mariposa sailed started on a tour of
the Island, with the Intention of exer
cising his megaphoned phonograph
wherever he could find natives to listen.
The Mariposa's cargo Included 47,847
cocoanuts, vanllJa, fruit, pearl shells,
copr4 and other tropical products.
Among her passengers were the follow
ing named:
I... M. Ih'tmtoa. Mrs. L. Schmidt. Miss I.
Gallagher. JMmond Fia, J. C. Buckingham. J.

cf the Union to assist in -carrying on
the good work. At an early date Judge
Morrow will take steps toward organ
izing a branch in this city. This will
b? the first society on record that in
cludes within its objects the enlisted
n:en of the navy and the marine forces.
Mrs. Grace Glenwood Higgtnson. wife
cf Admiral Hipginson. is president and
Charles H. Darling is corresponding
secretary. Among the honorary vice
presidents are President Roosevelt.
William H. Moody, Charles H. Darling.
Whitelaw Reid, Senators Hale and
Fcnrose and Juflge Morrow.
The funds of the society will be fur
nished from the dues and donations
from private persons. There will be a
life membership fee of $25, dues J'> per
annum and a membership fee of $1.
All thÂ° funds -wil: t>e devoted to the re
lief of the widows and orphans of of
ficers and enlisted men in the United
States navy.
In speaking of the society Judge
Morrow said yesterday:
"*A large proportion of officers and
enlisted men die in the navy leaving
families without any support except
perhaps a small pension. There is no
one to look after the children, to send
them to school, etc. These things the
society proposes to look after."
The new organization will be to the
widows and orphans of the navy what
the Red Cross Society has become to
the sick and wounded on the field of
battle, end it is destined to become
very popular.
BERLIN, April 15.â In the Reichstag
to-day Count Â¦: von Kanitz, the Agra
rian leadpr, referring-to ;the report of
Foreign Secretary^ von .Richthoff, on
the prop-ess . the commercial treaty,
negotiations, asked how matters stand
with the United' States!. The latter, he
added," had a heavy active balance of
trade, which'"' substantially is to the
detriment of Germany. The greatest
wealth jkji accumulated, in the United
States ; at the.cost of the entire world.
If new- commercial treaties must be
made, then let it be with the United
States above all..
. This agreed, Count von Kanitz
claimed; with what* Chancellor yon
Bulow â¢ formerly said. Nevertheless,
nothing . whatever had been heard in
dicating that treaty negotiations with
the United States has been com
menced.. .Von Kanitz expressed special
pleasure, at' the fact that- the com
mercial classes were beginning to see
'that the present status of trade rela
tions'; with the United States, cannot
boi continued. He cited the yearly re
port of the Hamburg Chamber of Com
merce, proposing that if the United
Slates does not conclude a tariff treaty
with Germany, American goods must
be tariffed differentially. Continuing,
Count von Kanitz said:*T
"We must at least try to conclude
a reciprocity arrangement mutually
advantageous with the United States.
America's reckless provocatory tariff
policy must be radically changed."
NEW YORK. April 13.â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say: Trade 1s still ir-,
regular, with unseasonable cool weath
er the chief and the, only drawback,
in some sections, notably the South
and portions of the East and West,
brighter weather has helped trade and
incidentally crop prospects, but the
poor winter wheat crop outlook In the
Ohio Valley, very cool weather in the
lake region and high water or frosts
in the Western part of the cotton belt
have affected business or retarded
spring planting. Foreign trade returns
have seemed to favor the manufactur
ing rather than the agricultural inter
ests. Â¦ Â«Â¦ :: . f /
Most measures of trade point to . a
smaller volume of business than a year
ago, but it is' to* be noted'that, while
a slight decrease may be shown in
gross railway earnings for March, the
first quarter's earnings will fall little
behind ! a year ago, showing that in
of products moved there is lit
tle difference from a year ago, and
that the railroads have so far this year
almost held their own.
The industrial situation .has .not been
entirely favorable. Iron" and steel, coal,
coke, lumber and naval stores inter
ests note either activity in production
and consumption or improved demand
from various sources, but the cotton
goods industry is curtailing production
steadily; there is less activity irrshoe
manufacturing, due to severe f winter
weather, curtailing demand- or divert
ing it to rubber goods, which have been
active, and the building and other in
dustries are marred by labor troubles
which, while not involving large num
bers of men, result in annoying and
expensive delays. The woolen . goods
demand is not up to expectations. The
strength of a large number of staples,
such as hides, leather, iron and steel,
cheese, tea, flour, copper and lead, is
a noticeable feature.
MARKETS ENCOURAGING.
While spring trade has been disap
pointing in many lines and immediate
business is not up to expectations, the
number of markets reporting -good or
ders for future delivery is large. Col
lections show little or no improvement.
-Iron is rather quieter this week, less
eagerness to obtain supplies of pig be
ing noted at several markets.-
] .Wheat (including flour) exports for
the week ending April 14 aggregate
1,213^55 bushels, against 1,854,370
bushels last week and 2,977,777
bushels last year.
From July 1. 1903, to date they ag
gregate 119.050.S59 bushels, against
179,762,553 bushels last season.
Business failures in the United
States for the week ending with April
14 numbered 198 against 201 last
week and 130 in the like week in 1903.
In Canada failures for the week
number 20, as against 24 last week
and 18 in this Week a year ago.
R. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review of
Trade to-morrow will say:
ADVERSE LiABOR CONDITIONS.
Â¦ ; Tardy spring weather, following an
unusually severe winter, makes it dif
ficult to restore satisfactory trade con
ditions, but it is encouraging to
find at many points this unseasonable
weather' the only, cause of complaint,
and there is. always, hope that the early
losses may be made up, at least in
large measure, when the normal con
ditions arrive. In the meantime sales
of dry goods are restricted and stocks
in all positions from producer to con
sumer are larger than is desirable.
Aside from the cotton States, where
business is brisk, the week's dispatches
indicate that early gains were main
tained, but little further, progress oc
curred. Labor controversies are still
an adverse factor. Â¦
' Railroad earnings in the first week
of April were 7 per cent smaller than
last year.
No definite check to progress In the
iron and steel industry is 'discerned, al
though it lacks . uniformity and in
some departments it is flifficult to find
encouragement.
Firmness and activity continue in
the Chicago hide market and foreign
dry hides are held steady by the
prompt absorption of arrivals.
. Failures this week number 225 in
the, United States, against 2>2 last
year, .and 16 in Canada, compared
with 16 a year ago. '.:../Â¦'.

THE news of the destruction of the Russian battle
ship Petropavlovsk. which carried to the bottom
with it Vice Admiral Makaroff and a crew of 8oo
men, has stunned Russia and elicited the sympathies of
all the nations, whether they favor the; arms of the Czar
or not. ,This sudden snuffing out of the lives of hun
dreds of brave men, not through the. shock of battle,
but by the terrible agency "of their own engines, turned
against themselves,- has nothing- of the halo of a glorious
defeat after manful struggle, butis i the grim essence of
pure mischance.
VVhen the Japanese torpedo-boats stole into the harbor

could not but applaud their daring, even though part of

of commiseration for the loss to Russian, arms. When
the gallant crews of the cruiser Variag and the gun
boat KorÂ«itz sailed but of: Chemulpo harbor oil the same
day to meet certain destruction at the hands of the
overwhelming Japanese fleet, 7 admiration .'for the heroic"
which is the same the" world over, pulsed in generous
measure for the men who could say: "Tell them at home
that we did our best." But the; trusted vice admiral of
the Russian fleet and his hundreds' of men Who went

Ansivers to Queries.
There is only one creature that we
know of besides mankind which shows
Its appreciation of flowers and green
foliage by adorning its . home with
them, and that is the "gardener bird"
of New Guinea (Amblyornls inornatus),
a member of the family of bower birds
which are peculiar to the Australian
region, Including New Guinea. Some
naturalists place these bower birds
among the birds of paradise. The first
account of this singular appreciation
of floral, beauty by birds was given by
Signor Beccari, who says that they
build a hut about two feet in height,
with a central support of a small tree
growing in a- glade or clearing in the
dense forests. The roof, which slopes
to the ground, is composed of the stems
of the orchids placed in a radiating
fashion. In the interior, access to
'which is by an angular opening, the
central support is covered with moss in
the form of a cone, so that a circular
promenade is made between it and the
sloping roof. 'But the extraordinary
effort of this bird is evidenced outside
this playhouse, for in front is laid out,
with infinite care truly, a garden. Fresh
moss Is brought by the" diligent occu
pants, and a verdant carpet, extending
about six feet, is first prepared, on
which are laid blossoms and berries of
every variety in profusion to delight
the eyes. As these wither or become
unsightly they are removed and laid
in a heap at the back of the hut, pre
sumably out of sight of these ultra
refined little birds, and upon the mossy
lawn are - placed continually fresh
blooms. As far as is known each of
these habitations Is occupied only by
one pair of birds, and it is not certain
whether the tasteful decorations are
arranged by the male only; it would be
pleasant to think that it was so â that
all this refined effort was but to show
his devotion and to make some little
reparation for his lack of beauty and
dingy appearance.â Westminster Ga
zette.
A Gardening Bird.
An Americanized Russian has pat
ented a new process of embalming,
which consists in casting a solid block
of glass around the subject to be pre
served, through which the features and
outlines of the body will be perfectly
visible. As no air can possibly enter,
the .remains are- expected to .-.last in
definitely, till some shock destroys the
crystal block which encases them like
so many files in amber. The inventor
hopes that the relics of great men will
be preserved in this way, remaining
to af tertime In their habit as they
lived, with vast mausoleums in which
to place them, entrance to which will
be deemed an honor like that of burial
in, Westminster or Santa Croce. The
mechanical process by which all this
is to be made possible, and on which
the Government has issued a patent. Is
quite simple. The remains are first
surrounded - with a coating of sodium
silicate, or water glass, which is al
lowed to dry. When the water has
been sufficiently evaporated, the sub
ject is â¢ placed in a mold which is to

A well known San Francisco journal
ist, whose hair has become white in
the pursuit of his calling, showed his
ready wit before a curious Market
street crowd recently. The day was
stormy and the streets were wet and
slippery. The newspaper man was
coming to work shortly before 1 o'clock.
As the car on which he was riding
approached Lotta's Fountain he jump
ed to the pavement with the Intention
of getting under cover as soon as pos
sible. But he struck a slippery spot
on the asphalt and went down with
a crash. His knee was wrenched, his
umbrella was broken, his glasses were
smashed, his coat was torn and alto
gether he looked like a wreck. A num
ber of people rushed to his assistance
and soon a large crowd had collected.
He arose unaided, however, and looked
around him in a dazed .sort of way.
A spectator grasped him by the shoul
der, turning him toward the retreat
ing car.
"Get the number and the names of
the gripman and conductor. That's
the only way you can get damages,"
he shouted.

It deeply grieved Sereno E. Payne,
the Republican floor leader, when Mr.
Maddox of Georgia raised the point of
no quorum last Saturday and thus
threatened to prevent the House from
passing a lot of bills. With a heavy
sigh Mr. Payne arose, steered his port
ly form across to the Democratic side
and looked down on Mr. Maddox with
a gained look.
"Maddox," said Payne in a seduc
tive tone, "why do you ball things up
this way just as we are getting along
so nicely? You have some secret rea
son, Maddox. Tell me what it Is."
"Mr. Payne," began Maddox with
dignity.
"Confidentially," said Mr. Payne in
a wheedling voice. "I won't breathe
it to a soul."
"As I was about to say, Mr. Payne
â " resumed Mr. Maddox.
"Just among us girls," pleaded Mr.
Payne.
The grizzled, lean, bald-headed old

gasped a couple of times. Then he

THE most noticeable feature in the popularity of
the Sunday Call Magazine are the names that give
it such a high literary tone, such names of world
wide fame, . indeed, as are not to v be fo'und together at
one time in any other magazine, daily, weekly or month
ly, anywhere else on earth for two or five times the
price of the . Sunday Call.
The w Sunday Call , to-morrow will be a particularly
pleasing and attractive confirmation of this fact.
To begin, with it will contain "The Lord of Chateau
Noir," by A. Conan Doyle, whose Sherlock Holmes
stories are not the most fascinating tales he has written,
as this unique story from his pen will bear ample wit
ness. It is replete with adventure and ends as only
A. Conan' Doyle's thrilling stories can end â in the most
unexpected manner possible. .
Another name. to be conjured with is that of the "Mark
Twain of England," the famous British humorist, Jerome
K. Jerome, who will begin a series of his pungently
vyitty articles in the Sunday Call to-morrow with one
entitled, "On the Drilling of a Modern Army," a timely,
topic which this clever writer spits upon his sharp pen
and grills to the Queen's taste. There is also a per
sonal interview, with this London literary idol, which
gives a new view of the pathetic life struggle from which
so much good fun has grown.
Â¦ Next in importance is the second installment of "The
Queen of Quclparte," by Archer Butler Hulbert, in
which both the author and his book are of exceptional
value and absorbing interest at this time, not more be
cause Mr. Hulbert is such an excellent writer than that
he knows so thoroughly the subject of which he writes,
the superstitions of the Koreans and Russia's secret
intrigue in the Far East, both of which have led to the
present war with Japan. This novel is historically true,
but it :s more fascinating than history because' of the
thrilling love story that runs' through it.
Albert . Sonnichsen is comparatively a new name in
American literature, but it. is a name that has already
won wide praise as the author of the "Deep Sea Vaga
bond" tales now running in the Sunday Call. "The Saga
of Trig Olafsen, - the Swimming Mate," in the Maga
zine-to-morrow, will be found as strange, as fascinating
and as all absorbing as its title.
Add to. this "His Own Heart," by Oliver L. Mitchell;
'Sarah's Strategy," by C. B. Lewis, and "Over a Honey
s?wk!e," by A. M. Davies Ogden, and a truly high-class
and entertaining fiction number is presented.
However, the Sunday Call to-morrow contains many
excellent features besides, notably, the "Czar's Wild
West in the Far East," by Ivan Vannekoff, a writer
famous in Russia; "How Admiral Togo Prepared for
War," by Toyohiko Turushima, an author equally famous
â¢n Japan. Together these two articles show why so
many of the Russian ships are being lost at Port Arthur.
Â£qua ; ly ; timely and an article that will create a furor
among the sporting fraternity, because of, its expose
of inr dern ring methods is "How Fighters Break Their
Own Bones," by Professor De Witt C, Van Court, box
ing instructor at the Olympic Club, a name that stands
for special excellence in his own field. The photographs
with this article are a remarkable feature in themselves.
To make tip a perfect artistic whole, the two sections
of the Magazine have been beautifully bound between
two notable paintingsâ that on the front page of Mrs.
Amy Talbott is the first* of a series of exquisite pictures
of Popular Society Women, painted from life by Mrs.
Rosa Hopper Plotner. That on the , front page of the
second section is one of a series of large paintings that
are now 'attracting attention at the Spring Exhibition of
the "Hopkins Art Association. It is called "In Egypt"
and is from the brush of. Matilda Lotz.
: Both of these beautiful pictures are reproduced in
multiple colors. Â¦ -

taste, but of far better quality than
some of the water a desert traveler i3
occasionally compelled to use. The
Papago, dipping this water up in his
hands, drank It with evident pleasure,

cessive drought, but that they used it
also to mix their meal preparatory to
cooking it into bread.
Illustrative of the energy with
which mining is nqw pursued in this
State and of the profits that are de
rived therefrom^when the business Is
carefullj* considered and economically
handled,' there might be noted scores
of mines that are known all over the
world for the wealth that they have
afforded and for what they still con
tain. An example of the interest now
attaching to mining in California is
afforded by the continuous acquisi
tion of Jands along the river banks in
certain localities for dredger mining
ground. One California county is op
erating successfully^ more than two
score expensive dredger gold mining
plants.
W. P. Hammon, the father of gold
dredging in this State, has recently
placed contracts for the con
struction of two great dredgers to
delve for gold in the Tuba - River,
above Marysville. As the Government
Xearly every county in this State
produces some mineral profitably.
The placer period has passed away to
a great extent, but this does not by
any means indicate that the greatest
record of the State for mineral output
has yet been made. Ancient river
channels promise great additions to.
the world's wealth when California
exploits them thoroughly. The quartz
mining along the mother lode and on
mountain ranges that are hundreds of
miles in length is yet email in extent
compared to what it will be. The
cheaper methods, electrical- power,
cheap petroleum fuel to take the place
of wood and other factors enter into
the consideration. Copper, gold, iron,
quicksilver, petroleum â these alone
make up a great array in behalf of
California and they represent only a
#hare of the mineral wealth of this
State. - Â» :/
"Because, without enterprise, energy,
push and business tact, the mine must
remain closed upon its hidden treas
ures; without it the stamp mill and
the smelter must remain idle; without
it the puddling furnace chilled and the
rolling mill rest upon its sleeping cogs;
without it the music of the anvil will
r.Q more be heard and the
sparks of grinding wheels no
more be seen; without it no
fiery, strained engine will dash across
the earth, or steel rails lie to afford
it safe transit; without it no !- teaming
monarch of the ocean will bid de
fiance to angTy waves and carry to dis
tant lands happy beings who laugh at
its fury; without it no Instantaneous
spark will flash, either its good or evil
news across continents, or illuminate
our streets and homes; without it no
busy hive* of Industry will be filled
with thrifty workmen, no loom weave
or spindle spin, no art adorn or science
enlighten; without it all industries lan
guish and commerce perish."
Attention is called to the represent
ations of Mr. Mahon, not because they
are more unusual in kind than any
statements made public in behalf of
mining States and Territories; on the
contrary they are Just of the sort that
has been made familiar by reiteration.
Capital being attracted to mines by
having their riches known and the
same applying verily to any mining
section as a whole, California should
be cushed to the front on merit as a
mineralized area.
"reasons" is that "Oregon has more
to interest capital in natural products
than any other State or Territory in
the Union." Of course. Mr. Mahon
does not mean this or else is ignorant
of what California contains in the way
of "natural products." This is not to
detract 'from the reputation of Oregon,
which is rich in resources, mineral
and agricultural, and in other ways;
but in justice such statements as are
sent out broadcast as an advertisement
for the coming Mining Congress
should conform to ascertainable facts.
Probably Mr. Mahon's enthusiasm has
misled him. Xo one will take excep
tion to the concluding paragraphs of
Mr. Mahon's energetic appeal "to the
miners and to Oregon at large to make
the Mining Congress what it ought to
be to command attention:
The American Mining Congress will
assemble at Portland, Or., on August
21. Irwin Mahon, the secretary of the
congress, has sent out a pamphlet, or
circular letter in which he gives
"nineteen pertinent and most prac
tical business reasons why Oregon
should be active and liberal in making
the coming session a success." These
reasons interest other portions of the
Â»oast outside of Oregon, because cer
tain assumptions are made that will be
open to question.
Setting apart the fact that Portland
is about to become, next year, the
scene of the Lewis and Clark Exposi
tion and that a little preliminary fan
fare of trumpets is more than excus
able on that ground, it is still not in
accordance with the facts* that "Ore
gon promises to be the greatest
mineral-producing State or Territtory
in the Union." There is every reason
to suppose that Oregon is surpassed
by California in variety of minerals
that can be produced commercially at
it profit; that in values in mineral de
posits there is a great advantage that
California can conservatively and
safely claim in comparison with any
other part of the Pacific Coast. This
has always been so and there is no
reason * to imagine that the mineral
deposits of California are even fairly
touched when the magnitude of what
remains to be uncovered is considered.
Another of Secretary Mahon's
Mining Activities.
The Butte miner who. is being put in shape to make a
"Roman holiday" with Jeffries acknowledges the latter
has the advantage of ring ex'perience, hitting power and
weight, but that "otherwise" they are evenly matched.
Some people can thrive on mighty little consolation.
THE revelations in the Smoot investigation have put
the Mormon hierarchy on the defensive. Inside
the church there was developed a spirit of revolt
on the part of the young men : and women that was
alarming tb the leaders* This revolt was in the form
of' opposition to the polygamous teachings of the church
and the polygamous practice of President Smith and
some of the ApJostles. The defense runs, therefore,
an appeal to these uneasy members of the church,
which is indirectly a defense of polygamy, by declaring
that the opposition to it in the Gentile world is produced
by immoral practices among Gentiles.
If â¢ the church can demonstrate to its faithful members
that polygamy is moral because those who oppose Â¦ it
are guilty of immoral^ practices, it may check the spirit
of schism in its own ranks; The fact that the defense is
of this character is evidence of , the strait in which the
leaders find themselves. When -President Smith returned
from Washington and was fnet by, his five wives and
thirty-two of his forty-two 'children, there was a public
acknowledgment following the admissions in his.testi
mony that he is the head of a harem. ' ..,'- :
While the enthusiasm of his fellow rulers of the
Mormon world was unabated and they hailed him as a
religious hero, a considerable part of the membership
did not share in these ascriptions to the leader. v These
look upon polygamy as an unnatural condition and their
association with the growing Gentile population makes
them ashamed of it. It becomes necessary then to im
press them Â¦ that the Gentile society with which they
associate is unworthy of their respect and that they
should not permit their conduct to be influenced by its
opinions. If this plan succeed they are driven back
into sympathy with the church and all that it teaches,
and to a firm support of the leaders and .all that they
practice.
The Deseret Ne,ws, the church organ, has undertaken
this work and carries it on by what we believe to be
a thorough misrepresentation of Gentile sentiment. In
its discussion the News says: "'Refined society' .was
much more shocked at the number of President Smith/s
children than even over the fact that he acknowledged
the wives whom he wedded previous to the issuance
of 'the manifesto.' So with the course of other 'Mor
mons' in the. same status. The objectionable thing is
that children are born to those plural wives: Punish
ment for this increase is the demand of modern moral
ists of the school of suppression." :â¢.'.,
This is not true. If the mothers of President Smith's
children have an equal number of children it would be
but little over eight to each. Families of eight children
in the Gentile world are common. They are no curios
ity, nor is their presence in "refined society/' or out of
it, a cause of criticism or offense. The President of tfie
United States has a family â¬>f six children, and^ if this
Mormon defense is true society should be shocked at it,'
but it is not. The numerous children of Senator Hale
of Maine and the large families of other Senators and
Representatives, in some cases numbering more than
the children of President Smith's individual wives, shock
no one and cause, no other than a feeling of admira
tion that such public men find their official duties con
sistent with the proper care of many children. Indeed,
among the Gentiles, husbands' and wives who have no
children are much more the objects of pity than those
who have are the, objects of aversion.
The objection to President Smith is not that he has
fort3'-two children, but runs to the number of his wives.
The results of such a system of plural marriage are
well known in Utah. The nurture and admonition
which a father owes to his children cannot be given
by him to such groups of families. During his testi
mony he was obliged to ask for time to refer- to memo
randa to answer either how many children a particular
wife had, or the date of their birth. It is certain that
these children are' without the joint care which those
receive who are reared in a home daily and continually
ruled by the presence of the father and the mother.
President Smith's five wives live in five separate
houses. On his return from Washington, after his gen
eral reception, he paid visits of courtesy to. eatfh of these
five homes of his forty-two children. If the Deseret
News thinks that "refined" or any othet form of society
has.no objection to that spectacle it is \ mistaken. If
the young Morman will choose to think he will learn
that that which in the Gentile world is regarded as
vice is taught by the church to be heaven inspired virtue.
Non-Mormon society is by no means, free of offenses
and vices, but its conscience stamps them as such. The
Mormon conscience, on .the other 'hand, is taught to
regard those very offenses and vices as moral and elevat
ing when they are enjoined by "revelation" and practiced
by the hierarchy.
There is a merchant of this city who
has a nice suburban home, an amiable
wife and a pretty little five-year-old
daughter. This couple, tofctheir morti
fication, a few evenings since at sup
per time learned that it is not wise
to discuss domestic econpmy in the
presence of the little one. They ex
pected company for supper and at the
last moment the servant entered the'
room where the three members of the
family were seated, awaiting the ar
rival of the company, and announced
in a whisper something that seemed
to astonish the lady. When the ; serv
ant retired the wife said to her hus
band, who was'to- act as host: "Dearie,
you will have to go light on the butter
to-night. Mary says there is only a
thin slice In the house and it's too late
and too far to send for a square."
After all had been seated and the
supper had in part been discussed v one
of the guests requested another helping
of butter, but before the host "could
comply with the request the little one
exclaimed: "Here, go light on the but
ter. All that's in the house is that lit
tle piece on the dish."
The mother blushed, the host looked
annoyed and said sharply to the child,
"Now, miss, you go right up to your
room."/
The little one stepped down and out
of the dining-room, leaving the host
to offer an explanation; but a moment
after he heard laughter outside the
door and, looking through the window,
saw his little daughter racing up the
road on her little bicycle.
Fearing that she might run away
because she had been punished, he hur
riedly excused himself and, rushing
outside, called' to her. The little one
wheeled back and then the father said
to her sternly, "Didn't I tell you to
go to your room?" The child inno
cently replied: "Yes, papa; I- went to
my room, but you didn't tell me to
stay there."
The father allowed the child to re
turn to the dining-room on her prom
ise not to speak another word.

A MORMON DEFENSE.
Just north of Sonora, Tuolumne
County, .is a deposit of marble that
has been, bonded by. TV. J." Holmes. A
quarry may be developed at that point
if the stone is perfectly white.
The Allen mine on Rogue Creek, In
Oregon, is reported to have been sold
to Charles d'Autremont of Duluth for
$750,000. C. J. Allen of Portland, with
associates, has worked the property
several years. According to the PortÂ»
land Oregonlan, $600,000 is paid in cash;
the remainder will" be paid later.
An electric lighting plant of 150 lights
has been installed at the Soulsby mine
in Tuolumne County, the lights to be
psed underground and also on the sur
face.
Between twenty and twenty-five men
are steadily employed on a desert mine
that is twenty-two miles. north of Bar
stow, to which It is necessary to haul
water a distance of fcnir^miles. Gold
and copper are found in the ores at
this point. A mill has been ordered
by the Red Mountain Gold, and Copper
Company, which is operating'the prop
erty. ; . Â¦ . â¢ Â¦ ;.-';;-,;.
Large values in gold are reported to
have been taken out in new gravel
mines at Calaveras County. At Doug
las Flat a main channel -has been en
countered, according to local report, at
a depth of 150 feet. Other gravel claims
may b'e opened in the same locality.
The substitution of electrical power
for steam has reduced the number of
men employed at the Keiswlck smel
ters of the Mountain Copper Company
by seventy-five. Five furnaces are in
operation, each needing the services of
forty men, twenty for each shift.
Late numbers of the Nome Nugget
report that there are about 100 men on
Candle Creek. The Xugget says that
the contributing cause for . the falling
off in the gold production of the Sew
ard peninsula in Alaska last year was
the lack of rain. "The falling off in the
production, while it is to be regretted,
is no reflection upon the gold-producing
capabilities of this section. The mining
man has much to contend with in these
high altitudes. An early spring and a
late fall mean an increased gold output,
and a late spring and an early fall will
inevitably bring a reduction in the out
put of the yellow 'metal. These fluc
tuations will always be found, notwith
standing the improved methods of min
ing which are rapidly being adopted
and the construction of many new
ditch systems. The gold is here; we
know that; and it will be taken out."
Speaking again of the conditions that
led to the falling off In the gold output
of Seward peninsula last year, the
Xugget says that "the preceding winter
was severe, there was an unusually
heavy fall of snow and heavy glaciers
accumulated In many creeks. Mining
operations were late In starting up. For
these reasons mining men generally
predicted a decrease in the* output last
fall at the close of operations, which,
too, was somewhat early." :
Additional space for the exhibition
of the California mineral display at St.
Louis has been secured, thirty-five feet
more length, so that the total exhibi
tion space in the Mines and Mining
building to be occupied by the min
erals, mining "machinery and illustra
tive mineral structures of California,
including the great arch, is 145x43 feet.
A letter has been received from State
Mineralogist Aubury announcing that
fact. Mr.. Aubury also writes that the
outlook is good for California having
a better mining show at St. Louis than
any of its rival mineral States. The in
stallation of exhibits has only begun.
According to the Rampart Forum
hydraulic plants will be large factors
hereafter in the development of mining
in the Rampart district. Rhode Island
Creek will be worked by the hydraulic
process. The Big Minook Mining Com
pany is putting in hydraulic apparatus.
More creeks have been worked In the
Rampart district during the past win
ter than in any previous season.
Several properties of some size are
reported to have been just sold. In this
list are included the Sierra Buttes mine
in Sierra County, which passes into the
possession of a company including E.
A. and J. O. Hayes of San Jose; the
Three Stars mine, in Placer County,
Including 2S0 acres of land, twenty
shafts, seven original mining locations,
a twenty-stamp mill, etc., for all of
which, so reports the Placer Heraldt
about J200.000 was paid. The Mountain
King mine, in Calaveras County, near
Hodson, has been sold to Allen & Lit
tlefield of San. Francisco. The local
papers of that place say that a sixty
stamp mill will be erected at the mine.
A San Francisco company has bought
the Punch Creek mine, on Humbug
Creek, in SIskiyou County, which was
recently purchased by G. W. Grayson.
The .Treka Journal says that the price
is between $60,000 and $70,000. There
have have been several sales of frac
tional interests in mother lode proper
ties in the past few weeks. There is
general activity in the California camps
and interest is thereby stimulated.
A large tract of land for. gold dredg
ing has been sold in the last fort
night, 200 acres in all, situated about
two miles south of Oroville. The sale

the entire tract. The land is one mile
from the Feather River.
proposes to build barriers on the Yuba
at and above Daguerre Point and as
Mr. Hammon knew that the ground
was good for gold 'dredging, he has
agreed to build a bank 100 feet at
the base and twenty feet below high
water mark and forty feet wide at the
ctown. The ground above Daguerre
Point, so says Mr. Hammon, will re
quire more powerful dredgers than
have hitherto been operated,, because
of the debris to be cut through. The
two machines that have been ordered
will dredge sixty feet below the water
line and ' will excavate from 2000 to
2500 yards daily. The dredgers will
be in operation by June next. Even
tually there will probably be as many
dredgers in the Yuba district as there
are in" the Oroville district. Two
dredgers will soon be operating on the
Bear River near Wheatland.

of the company, which Harriman has
purchased after promising to care for
the minority shareholders.
Although President John Martin
and his financial associates In the
North Shore road decline to give con

that the Cazadero line, with its elec

The road, 117 miles in length, had
been offered to several syndicates, but
declined on the ground that it was not
a paying investment, and was finally
bought by Harriman, who values it
only as a means of thwarting the
Santa Fe from acquiring terminal
rights on that section of the bay shore.
Although Its present owners claim
to have invested over $1,200,000 in
the improvement of the company's

forth at length the reasons why he dis
approves of the bills. Principal among
them is that the measures are Intend
ed to harass Gray "Bros., who have
established a quarry on Thirtieth
street, near Castro, and have agreed
to conduct it bo it will not be a nuis
ance.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday transmitted
to the Board of Supervisors his vetoes
of the two ordinances extending the
limits within which it is prohibited to
conduct rock crushing and rock quar

fact that t,he ordinances are identical
with two he recently vetoed and says
that as conditions remain the same he
sees no reason to change his attitude
on the matter. -

Since the mob dispersed this morning
no further attempt to lynch Azel D.

A lynching was prevented solely by
the bravery of Sheriff Thomas Cody,

The King Planing Mills, on King
street, between Third and Fourth,
were damaged by fire to the*extent of
$5000 shortly after 6 o'clock last even
ing. ' The fire, which jj started on the
roof, was caused by an overheated
smokestack.
L. C. Brandt, who occupies a build
ing adjacent, saw the flames and
turned in the first alarm. When Act
ing Chief Dougherty arrived on the
scene the fire had gained considerable
headway on the second j and third
floors and two additional alarms were
sent in. Dougherty and his men did
remarkable work in stopping the pro
gress of the fire as they did. The
building burned like tinder, but the
firemen succeeded in extinguishing the
flames before they reached the ground
floor, on which is located most of the
machinery.
The plant is owned by M. Hansen

PARIS, April 15. â The Council of
Ministers has decided that Colonel
Marchand's recent open letter refer
ring to his resignation is an offense
against military discipline and is de
serving of censure and punishment.
The nature of the punishment
awaits the action of War Minister
Andre, who was not present at the
Council, but it is understood that it
will be thirty days; confinement, his
resignation from the army thereafter
being accepted. Owing to the popu
lar devotion to Marchand as the hero
of Fashoda the case is receiving wide
spread attention.

IS CAUSE OF TROUBLE
PORTLAND, Or., April 15.â High
waters in the rivers of Eastern Oregon
and the Blue Mountains have so seri
ously affected "railroad traffic on. the
Huntlngton branch of the Oregon Rail
road and Navigation line that no trains
can be run over that division .of the
road for several days. Bridges have
been washed out in seVeral localities
and tracks built on, soft earth have
been so undermined and threatened as
to render their use for railroad pur
poses dangerous. ! .-.-.. .. '.'
Almost parallel conditions exist on
the Southern Pacific system near Ash
land, where landslides have so covered
the tracks as to fender traffic prohibi
tive. Half a score ' of trains are de
tained on either side of the obstruction
and nearly a thousand passengers are
waiting for the tracks to be cleared so
that they can proceed to their destina
tions. . ..Â¦;-. .
JACKSON*, Miss., April 15.â Ed Gam
mons, who murdered Lake Klnney and
the latter's daughter, with- whom he
was In love, at Walter Valley recently,
has made a confession. His statement
regarding the death of the young
woman is sensational. He says that
after he killed Klnney in the held he
went to the house and told the girl
of his deed. At first they planned to
run away and be married, but the girl
chanced her mind and asked him to
kill her. which he says he refused at
first to do. Then she tried to get the
pistol away from him. He then told
her to step off a few Daces and turn
her back, which she did, when he shot
and killed her.
In St. Petersburg this order is re
garded as an extraordinary precau
tion, which is bound to influence the
future relations of the Christians and
the Jews. " .
From the beginning of the war the
Jews in Bessarabia, like the rest of the
population, had shown their readiness
to serve their fatherland, which was
expressed in their declarations of loy
alty to the throne and their donations
to the sick and wounded. This was
pointed out by the Governor, who urged
the Bishop to direct his clergy to com
municate the facts to the people.
The Bishop immediately instructed
all the priests of his diocese to ex
plain on every civil occasion the loy
alty and patriotism of the Jews and
to point out that reports to the con
trary were false, adding that he
should be informed of air cases where
enmity was displayed toward the
Jews.
Before Easter the Governor of Bes
sarabia, Prince Ourusoff, called the
attention of Bishop Takoff of Kishe
nev to the malicious reports spread
among the people that the Jews, were
collecting 5 and sending money to aid
the Japanese. The Governor declared
the rumors to be absolutely without
foundation.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 15.â It
has Just developed that the powerful
influence of the church- was used in
Bessarbia to prevent trouble between
Christians and Jews. For the" first
time, so far as known, the church
stepped in to avert another Kishenev
affair.
There are many indications at this
time that J. X*. Gillette of the First
Intelligence comes from the south
that Senator Ward has developed con
siderable* strength as a candidate for
Congressional honors, it is said that
the Republican nomination in the
Eighth will not go to Captain Daniels
of Riverside. S. C. Smith of Kern
and MJ J* Ward of San Diego will each
have a strong following In the con
vention.
SOUTH DEVELOPS STRENGTH
The Republicans will open the
Presidential campaign in this State
at Sacramento on May 16, on the oc
casion, cf the biennial convention of
the California league of Republican
Clubs. The president of the league is
Lieutenant Governor Alrten Anderson.
He was chosen at Los Angeles four
years ago, and re-elected at San Jose
in 11*02. T"iere are indications of a
lively contest at Sacramento for the
honor of first place in the league. State
Senator M. L* Ward of San Diego,
Thomas Rickard of Alameda and Orrln
Henderson of San Joaquin are men
tioned as candidates to succeed A'den
Anderwon.
The B>;!id California Republican dele
gation in the House of Representatives
was brcken in 11*02 by the election of
Boll in the Second District, Livernash
in the Fourth and AVynn in the Fifth.
Republicans are quite confident of
thtir ability to achieve a victory at
the next election in the Second and
Fifth districts, and the prospects are
fair for Republican success in the
Fourth District. The opinion is wide
ly entertained that Frank L. Coombs,
the Republican nominee in the Second,
was really elected in 1902. but Bell
had a majority on the face cf the re
turns, and Coombs did not care to
make a contest for the seat. Duncan
K. Mclvinlay of Sonoma stands a
fair chanr.2 of securing the Republi
can nomination in this district. He
is a man of fine ability and exceptional
popularity.
The new committee will not have
much work of an imperative character
to perform until preparations for the
August primary election demand atten
tion. It is probable, however, that an
early meeting will be held to encour
age district organization and promote
registration for the Presidential elec
tion. The registration has closed, so
far as it affects the May primary elec
tion to select delegates to State and
Congressional cc-nventions for the pur
pose of choosing delegates to the na
tional convention. The number of vot
ers registered approximates 33,000.
The conventions to nominate Presi
dential Electors. Superior Judges, Con
gressmen, State Senators and Assem
blymen will not assemble until next
September. The delegates to these con
ventions will be chosen at a primary
election on the second Tuesday of Au
gust.

On'C. W. Clark's polo field at. San
Mateo, beginning at 2:30 p. m. to-mor
row, there . will be , a lacrosse match
between the. Talagoos of San Mateo
and an Olympic Club twelve.
The Olympic. Club team will be com
posed, of much the same 'men as on
last Sunday, though a I few new ones
will be tried.. The' Talagoos will take
the opportunity of trying out' some of
their junior, players and their team
will be somewhat, weaker, than the one
which played last Sunday at the Pre
sidio Athletic Grounds. The match is
one of a series of exhibition games
which are Intended to give men desir
ous, of learning the game a .chance to
practice and to, educate a body of spec
tators , in \ the points of the Canadian
national sport. The players appreciate
highly '- the . permission to. use. C. . W.-
Clark's field, which Is a much pleas
anter ground than the one near Harbor
Yiew.;-- !<j -: -'., . . Â¦'Â¦- -t. Â¦â¢'Â¦Â¦ Â¦-Â¦-â¢â¢Â¦Â¦ Â¦
The Olympic team will consist of the
following: .Gossip, goal; Burden, point;
Lynch," cover-point; 8 iiayfey, .de
fense; Minto, second defense; Petersen,
third defense; McCarthy,- center; Wim
perly,. third home;; Henneker, second

. In last -Sunday's game the Olympic
team lacked combination work and. fell
easy, victims â¢ to the Talagoos- : Peter
sen, the ; well; known fullback of... the
Vampire V. association'', football .. eleven,
will add to the strength of the | Olym
pics,, having been a member of the
English: international lacrosse team.
Last: Sunday : there were : some good
runs down; the; field for the Olympics,
but' the shooting; for . goal was. weak.
Some '; of the players, too, : seemed , in
clined to .turn the. struggle for.posses
sion of the ball into, a .wrestling match.
The model yachtsmen have had more
to contend with recently as regards
weather than the participants in any
other pastime. . For several weeks no
races could be held on account of the
wet weather. Last Sunday the heat
was beneficial to every other sport ex
cept model yachting. The sailors of
the small craft were all on hand to pi*
their boats against one another, but an
absence of wind made this impossible.
Up to date official races have been
held but once. The prospects this year
are better than ever, and so numerous
have the boats become that it has been
found necessary to restrict the' active
membership of the club to fifty. The
club officials feel that it will be im
possible to handle more boats than this
in the races.
Another reason for holding "back the
regattas is that M. C. Henschen, the
official -measurer, has had to resigrn.
owing to the pressure of business.
The Spreckels lake course is satisfac
tory, except in one place. This is the
big bay next to. the drive. This spot
is so sheltered by- trees as to rnake it
almost impossible for the yachts to
pass through the calm.
The first regular regatta will be held
on the 3d or 4th of July. In the mean
time trial races for the club p'ennant
will be held each Sunday.
The winning yacht each week re
ceives a pennant. At the end of the
season the boat with the most pen
nants gets the club pennant, emblem
atic of the championship.
~T. J. Cronin, a veteran of the leash,
will send his fast greyhound Fair Tra
lee against Lord Brazen, from the ken
nel of G. Lacy Crawford of St. Louis,
to-morrow at Union Coursing Park.
The. contest will be the second of the
series for the Grand National Cham
pion stakes. Contrary to his usual at
titude, Mr. Cronm announces himself
as being 1 satisfied with the way his
dog. has trained on. Trainer Jackson
is equally confident as to; the showing
his dog will make, so a 'spirited con
test is in prospect.
The reserve stake at Union Park "to
morrow has taken on the appearance
of an interstate affair. Among the
greyhounds which will start are: Mas

, At the last meeting of the California
Coursing Club A. C. Bradbury,: the vet
eran trainer, was restored to good
standing. Bradbury was ruled off by
the Ingleside, Coursing Club about four
years ago. - .
The Chicago Coursing Club will' hold
its'initial meeting on April 30 and May

will be continued weekly until ho't
weather puts a step to them. They will
be resumed in the fall.
The annual intercollegiate tenni3
tournaments between Stanford Univer
sity and the University of California
will be played this morning at Stan
ford. A month or so ago Stanford wa3
thought to have absolutely no chance
to -win. Her prospects % are much bright
er now, and although a cardinal vic
tory is hardly anticipated, the Palo
Alto players are expected to make a
good showing. The fact that the tour
nament is to be played at Stanford
â¢will give the players of that college
quite j an advantage. The California
players have played but once on the
Stanford courts, while their rivals have
been practicing there for weeks.
California will be represented by J.
Drummond MacGavin as first man in
singles, Neil Baker as second man in
singles and MacGavin and" Robert Va
riel in doubles. For Stanford George
Hodge will be first man in. singles.
Cleve Baker will be second man and
Baker and Hodge will play the doubles.
Hodge is a young player, frojn South
ern California, who has never played
on the courts here. He is considered
clever by some of the old Stanford
players.and as he has been' practicing
regularly of late he should be at his
best. He will be opposed to Drummond
MacGavin. The latter Is easily the best
player of the five- and is figured to win
handily from Hodge. MacGavin, how
ever, is erratic, and if he has an off
day his opponent will have an excel
lent chance to lower his colors. I *
The Baker-Baker match will probably
prove the closest of the three. - Cleve
Baker last year played George Baker of
California in the second singles match.
Neil Baker is a -brother of George and
hardly classes with, the latter. Last
year Cleve Baker won a set from
George : Baker and made the latter
work to beat him. From this.the Stan
ford players figure that Cleve Baker
has at least an even chance to beat his
opponent. Neil ' Baker is wonderfully
steady, and if Cleve Baker beats , him
it will not be on the former's errors.
The doubles, like the MacGavin-
Hodge ' match, should on f orin go to
California rather easily, but Variel,
like , MacGavin, is erratic and both are
hard men to figure on; Â¦ Â¦ Â¦'.* Â¦ ;
The entries for the Academic Ath
letic League tournaments must be In
to-day.' These* events will be held' In
the early part of May. As usual, the
greatest interest centers in the singles.
Herbert Schmidt of Boone's , University
Academy L and Herbert ' Long of Lowell
High" School "are easily the best play
ers, and one " of them is expected to
carry off the championship.
The Golden Gate Terinis Club has

Commodore Charles Stewart of the
Oakland Canoe Club is looking for
ward to an active season. A schedule
of events has been prepared, contain
ing several races and cruises in con
junction with the Encinal Yacht Club.
In the long championship canoe race,
â¢which will be held on September 10.
in order to induce a large number of
entries, seven cups will be presented
as= prizes. The contestants will start
from the California Yacht Club house,
proceed down Oakland Creek to the
bay. thence to the Encinal Yacht Club
enchorage and return. It is believed
the course can be covered in eix or
E'ven hours.
The first of the yacht clubs to open
the season will be the San Francisco,
which will hold its initial reception and
Jinks on Saturday, the 23d inst.. and its
first cruise on Sunday, the 24th. The
yachts are being rapidly put into com
mission and the whole fleet is expected
to be ready on opening day.
On Sunday, the 24th inst.. the South
Bay Yacht Club will hold its opening,
there being a high Jinks at the club
house at Alvlso, beginning at 11 a. m.
The officers of the South Bay Yacht
Club for the 1904 season are Dr. H. A.
Spencer, commodore; Louis Sonniksen,
vice commodore: Miles E. Wretman,
secretary; B. I. Schwartz, treasurer;
S. E. Smith, port captain; J. O. McKec,

J. R. Hanify's handsome new schoon
er, built in the yard of F. Stone &
Co., at the end of Baker street, near
Harbor View, was launched at 9:30 last
Saturday evening. M. A. JCewell's
schooner, Lady Ada, built in the same
yard, was launched at 10 o'clock on
Thursday morning, in the presence of
several quests invited by the owner
and by Mrs. Newell. Both are large,
roomy, comfortable, cruising craft and
should be by no means slow. Lady
Ada is nearly sixty feet in length over
all, while J. R. Hanify's boat is a little
shorter.
W. E. Lingard has sold the sloop
Flcetwing. which he owned for about
two years, to Dan Everett, also of the
Corinthian Yacht Club. It is said that
the sale- was made some months ago,
but the fact did not become known
"until lately. An agreement for the sale
of the "yacht at a certain price was
made after the close of last season be
tween W. E. Llngard and a well known
Journalist, but a higher sum was paid
by the present owner.
Secretary Henry Ward of the Ala
meda Cricket Club has handed in the
list of members of that organization,
which has thirty-nine names at pres
ent on its roll. These are A. E. Ack
lom, J. U. Bird, Harry Bird, B, Bird.

The foregoing list contains the names
of the Bird, Croll and Ward families,
who have been the mainstay of Ala

comprises A. E.'Acklom and F. J. Ben
nion, former members of the Pacific
Cricket Club, and of Bert H-- Kort
lang, who, on his return from Seattle,
announced his intention of staying
with the San - Francisco^ County Club.
It is expected that J. Mason, an
Australian, who played with some of
the best teams in his. own country,
will prove a valuable addition to the
strength of the Alameda eleven. A.
E. J. Chivers, the best goalkeeper . In
the California Association. Football
league, is an excellent cricketer- ae
well. Edwin Hood was one of the
strongest batsmen of the Alameda
team some years ago, but has played
little or no cricket Tor several sea
sons. G. I. Baugh is a steady man at
the bat and Â«*-gocd run-getter.
The name of .George Wiseman, for
merly a well-known member of the
Pacific Cricket Club, should be added
to the roll, of that organization. 'v,
The schedule of matches as issued
Â¦contains some errors, due to the neglect
of the committee appointed to prepare
it to regard the strong wishes of the
Santa Cruz Cricket Club, as express

San Francisco's "proposed athletic
field in Golden Gate Park, with its
nest of tracks for light harness horses,
cyclists and foot, racers and its .inner
oval for the use of all amateur sports
requiring" a large level . area' of ,turf , . is
pictured herewith for the first time.
It is a mind's eye view of the big pro
ject, drawn with faithfulness to. detail
by an artist who looked over the site
arid studied the j plans in Superintend
ent McLaren's hands. The picture is
more eloquent than- mere -words : and
explains the enthusiasm of. the work
ers who have done such "great service
In .collecting funds for the building
of it. â¢ .
In order to bring-out the perspective
more clearly the spectators pictured in
the. lower corner.are banked up a trifle
higher than they will be.-, in reality.
On this edge of the speed track a space
is provided 100 feet in- width and run
ning the length of the field. jA : gentle
raise of* twenty feet of this grass ? cov
ered surface will provide seating, ca
pacity for - many . thousands ! of specta
tors. The home stretch of all the
tracks will be located^ on this side and
just as excellent . a view of the field
will be afforded as though an unsightly
grand stand marred the landscape. The
absence of ' all' buildings and fences in
the amphitheater is .a -Mr.
McLaren's and will j make, the place
much more beautiful to the eye!
A tunnel for the admission of ath
letes to the oval will run, from a point
near the buildings depicted in the upper
corner. Polo â¢ ponies ' may be brought
through in this' manner and cyclists
may reach their" speed j track â¢ without
crossing the horse track. On the op
posite side of the field an entrance will
be provided for light vehicles. : On this
side will : be located the , sheds and
dressing* rooms . for. the reinsmen, the
buildings being situated a short
tance- from the oval â¢ and fitted wilh
all modern improvements. The > : ath
letes .will be quite as well provided for
in the manner of showers .arid rooms,
while a plunge is a possibility if the
money subscribed be sufficient. "
In dimensions â¢ the speed | track "will
measure exactly half : a mile in circum
ference. It .will ; be' "about; sixty feet
in width. Twenty feet', distant ,wln ;be
the cinder path, which is to run three
laps. to the mile, leaving ari inner' oval
of 900x480 feet. A gradual .slope from
the outer rim of green sward,: contirif
uing through the several J tracks,*-; r wlll
bring the surface of the- infield consid
erably lower than any other portion :of
tlie grounds. , - this scheme * will . bring
every part of the amphitheater in plain
view of the, spectators." â¢ In ; case! of' a
driving matlnce'the outen.rlm "will hold
the throng,, although the Â¦'. infield: will
be available". For cycle races the' same
space will be utilized, while an event 6n
the cinder path or the inner "field will
call the cycle track into; play, as a van
tage point for the spectators.
As the Place ; is planned >. it will i be
the finest public athletic 'field in "the
world and will set ;a ; pace "for "other
cities .to follow. [Members 'of the ' Ama

Scottish Bowlers Will Try Again.
After numerous postponements ths
new green in Golden Gate Park will
be thrown open this afternoon to' the
Scottish bowlers. This was announced
last Saturday, when the green was

A /variegated assortment of cheap
platers, fifteen in all, lined ap in the
curtain raiser, a mile' and fifty-yard
run. Vasallo, the mount of Jed Lewis,
had first call in the betting. He did
not finish among the first three. After
a long, hard drive, "Big Bill" Knappi
on the 15 to 1 srhot Quibe, caught the
pacemaker, Nellie Baun, winning by a
neck. Emil finished third.
Bob Smith's filly Del Carina, an 8

year-old scramble by, Sileo. The latter,
was: played -some days : ago for a "kill-:'
Ing," but failed to make, good on that
occasion. Yesterday, with Sheehan up,
the colt led from the start, running
ihlnearly three lengths before the. first
choice. Tommy -Butler finished . third
on Pirelia. Joe Jones had . the leg up
on Grenore, whi:Ii youngster appeared
a trifle shy on speed.- - .

firing line and then retired. Don Domo
held Sad ! Sam safe and, assuming the
leading position a furlong from the wire,
won going away from the favorite, At

ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
BERKELEY, April 15. â The ath
letes of the University of California
are about as fit as men can be for the
ordeal at Stanford Saturday after
noon. Trainer Walter Christie de
clares that their condition is the best
and that if the men can't win it is not
in them to. win.
As for the chances of winning the
field day California looks to have an
even break. At least. Christie think*
that way. He does not say California
will win or that she v.ill lose, but con
tents himself by saying that it will be
close. The fate of the whole day, ha
says, may rest on a single first or
second piace. as it did last year.
"I think it is pretty well even up."
said Christie to-night. "They will go
neck and neck to the finish. I wish
it was all over, so that we coald see
how they stand. -The California men
are in great shape now and so happy
and high spirited that it is encourag
ing."
The athletes will spend their last
time at the training table to-morrow
morning; when they will eat a light
breakfast before starting for Stanford.
They will lunch at the Occidental Ho
tel at noon and then take the 12:45
o'clock train to the rival university.-
There has been nothing but light
training on the track this "week. To
day nothing at all was . done. ;'Wil
cox's injured foot has mended so hÂ«i
will be able to go over the stick again
in the pole vault. He hurt the mem
ber in falling one day last week and
has been limping around ever since.

the extent of Tacoma's batting. To

The Judge, with the consummate art
of the actor, went about his work with
great deliberation, although the experts
at the ringside felt sure from the start
where the honors would rest. One by
one the entries were "given the gate,"
In show ring parlance, until only three
remained. These were Mrs. Charles
Newman's St. Bernard Lester C, Mrs.
L. S. Adams Jr.'s Great Dane Rupert
of Hentzau and Mrs. Charles K. Har
ley's bulldog Ivel Damon. The compe
tition finally narrowed down to the St.
Bernard and the Great Dane, and
Judge Mortimer looked them over crit
ically amid the breathless attention of
the spectators. He finally called for
the ribbon and handed it to Mrs. New
man. This Is the second year the big
St. Bernard Lester C has won in this
class.'
The most exciting and, incidentally,
the most picturesque competition of the
kennel club show In Mechanics' Pa
vilion last night was the Judging for
the best dog in the show owned by a
lady. The trophy was offered by Her
mann Oelrichs. Thirty-five prize ca
nines, with but few exceptions handled

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 15.
â The Stanford track athletes are in
the pink of condition for the annual
intercollegiate meet with Berkeley,
which will be held on the Stanford cin
der path to-morrow. Everywhere there
is a quiet feeling, of confidence, and a
determination to win. An exceedingly
close field day is anticipatedâ one that
will ;be a- duplicate of the.heart-break
ing meet of last year â and yet the
Stanford supporters can see ' nothing
but a cardinal victory, by a slight mar
gin. The most conservative of them
give Stanford 62 points to 60 for .Cali
fornia, while others quote the cardinal
as high as 73. There is nothing quite
so uncertain, however, as an'intercol
legiate contest, and it is safe to say
the outcome of- to-morrow's contest
will be in the balance until the end of
the meet. â - ..-v';; O
Trainer "Dad" Moulton. to whose un
tiring efforts the condition of the team
is due,- has this to say about the
chances: "I think our prospects are
good. Our team ought â¢ to' make 72
points. The condition of' the men is
fine â the nearer the time approaches
the more confidence they have."
Captain Holman also expects to head
a victorious team, but does not predict
so large a- score for the cardinal as the
trainer would give them. "We are go
ing to win," he said to-night, : "but the
score will - be â¢ close, and, of course,
something might happen to upset cal
culations." v
Picking out the men who look like
the â¢ largest cardinal point-winners,
there might be named N. E. Dole, "04,
Dunn, '04, Bell, '05. Holman, '04, C. E-
Hyde, '04 Crawford, '05, and Lanagan,
'04.'. These seven men will undoubtedly
carry off more than half of the points
made by Stanford.
Norman Dole, who earned the title
of champion pole-vaulter of the Pacific
coast last year, Is expected to carry
off the world's record to-morrow if con
ditions are favorable, He should put
the mark above twelve feet if he vaults
up to the; possibilities shown by his
practice work. He has also done high
er than 5 feet 10 inches in the high
Jump, and in the vicinity of 22' feet in
the broad 'Jump.
Walter Dunn of Stanford seems prac
tically conceded first place in both the
220 and 440 yard dashes by both the ad
herents of Berkeley and of Stanford.
He has covered the former distance
this year in :22 3-5, and the latter in
:51 3-5. Harry Bell, '05. tied with
"Brick" West, '06, in the broad Jump
in the Pomona meet, at 22 feet 2 3-4
inches, and practically equaled that in
jump a few days later in the Inter
class field day.
Captain Holman Is expected to re
peat his performance of last year In
winning the mile run, the first event
of the meet In addition Holman will
make some one run in very fast time
in order to win the half mile.

It was in the fourth that Dunleavy

and did well, as he sent the ball over

This invention has for its object the production of a novel lamp, particularly desirable for use as a
night lamp. Lamps for this purpose need not produce a-larjre flame; in fact, a comparatively small flame is
more desirable, but it is also desirable that the lamp be capable of burning for a long period without cefillinR
and without attention- and without emitting, any odor. These results are positively obtained. Directions

FRIDAY. APRII/ 15.
REALi ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Both Dr. Schafer and Boust were
discharged this morning by Justice
Millard after hearing the testimony in
the Midway 6ase, they having been
charged with assault to commit mur
der in connection with the shooting of
Cornell, which resulted-in the loss of
the latter's leg. At the time Cornell
fired on them they were discussing the
trial and not dreaming that their as
sailant intended to attack them.
Immediately following the shooting
Constable McKamy took Cornell and
his brother, who has been here during
the trial, ; into custody and conveyed
them in his buggy to the County Jail.
Cornell at the jail talked wildly and
apparently failed to recognize his
brother.
Cornell was not thirty feet from the
two men when he' attempted the
assassination. He, so far as is known,
spoke no words to any one, but a min
ute before he crossed over from the
Hughes corner toward the Arlington
and when he saw his Intended victims
he promptly, opened fire. He must
have been laboring under great excite
ment, for his bullets went wide of trfe
mark, save one, and that cut through
the pocket of Boust's coat.
BAKERSFIELD, . A*ril 15.â Shortly
before 3 o'clock this afternoon George
Cornell, who lost his leg in the Mid
way battle "of April, 19Q1, deliberately
opened flre_ on Dr. August Schafer and
former Deputy United States Marshal
E. J. Boust in front of the Arlington,
and as rapidly aa he could shoot he
emptied his pistol at the unarmed men.
Dr. Schafer and Boust were passing
down Nineteenth street and were close
to the car track conversing when they
were startled by a pistol shot. On look-
Ing up they saw that Cornell's * shots
were aimed at them. Boust dodged Into
Wlckersham's jewelry shop and Dr.
Schafer retreated a few feet.
As the last shot was fired Schafer
rushed frantically toward a citizen on
the sidewalk and asked for a weapon,
but the citizen was unarmed.
â¢ A short distance from the town
Stewart met an Italian, who said he
had seen a girl answering the descrip
tion of Dora Miller about three miles
farther on, going toward the Santa
Anita ranch. Stewart gave chase and
after a hard ride spied the girl across
a canyon. When. the horseman had
mounted the intervening ridge the
girl had disappeared.
A thorough search was made and at
last Stewart came across the girl lying
face downward in the high mustard.
He called to her to get up, saying
her sister was "waiting "for.- her- a few
miles down the' road, and receiving no
answer lifted her up-and placed her
upon the spare horse. Seeing that
further flight -.^as out of the question
Dora quietly submitted and was taken
back to Gaviota> She seemed perfect
ly sane, but refused" to talk of her
strange flight from. home. She looked
much the worse for her travels, having
slept in the open' Thursday night and
gone without food since Thursday
morning. After spending the day at
Gaviota, Dora took the evening train
for Los Angeles, accompanied by her
sister.
Thursday night Theresa Miller,
Dora's sister, came up from Los An
geles and got off the train at Naples,
sixteen miles, east of Gaviota. She
met Sheriff Stewart, who was return
ing from a trip to the northern end
of the county. Miss Miller interested
Stewart in her story and he promised
to return with her to Gaviota and aid
in the search. At 4 o'clock this morn
ing Miss. Miller and Stewart left Na
ples, arriving at daviota about half
past 6. Here they joined the search
party, Stewart procuring' a saddle
horse.
SANTA BARBARA, April 16.â
Pretty Dora Miller, the young L<os"An
geles girl who left ''her . home on the
7th of this month without giving her
family or friends a hint as to her
destination, was found this morning
near Gaviota by a search party which
had been scouring the country In that
vicinity for two days previous.
â¢ Thursday morning a party from
here started up the coast to follow
several clews of the girl's where
abouts, reports having reached here
of her passing through the upper end
of the county. The party reached
Gaviota and'there .pressed' a number
of recruits Into service, the country
around the town being thoroughly
searched before dark!
At about 9 o'clock Thursday even
ing one of the search party named
Roe came across the missing girl
upon a main road a short distance
from the town. He called to her, tell
ing her that there was 'a wire for her
at the station which she could get by
calling there, but before he could get
close enough to catch her. Dora made
her escape into the underbrush and
all efforts to find her were unsuccess
ful. The search party spent the night
at Gaviota, much -chagrined at having
their quarry" escape when capture
seemed almost certain.

Hides continue quiet and the local tanners

the East. There is nothing whatever new In
Hops. . A locaj house says of Wool : "The local
Wool market continues without interest. The
few buyers here are taking things coolly and
do not seem to care whether they do business
or not. Scourers complain that they cannot get
orders and therefore are buying sparingly. As
a matter of fact, there is only one scouring
concern here that operates with any degree of
liberality and for the time being even this firm
lacks the courage to purchase freely even of
cheap Wool, and no doubt California Wools
are cheap at the present time. Shearing In thÂ»
San Joaquinis pretty well over and the W00I3
as a rule are very defective. Only a small
share has been placed^ with scourers and ship
pers. In the Sacramento and Red Bluff regions
shearing has just commenced, and .within a
week cr ten days considerable country buying
will be in progress. Quotations continue purely
nominal."

CHICAGO, April 15. â Unofficial figures fore
casting an Increase Instead of a decrease in
the acreage of spring wheat caused weakness
In the wheat market to-day. At the close the
July option Hhowed a loss of %@%c from yes
terday's final quotations. Corn is down - %c;
oata are off 54 Cj and provisions 5c to 12 %c.
Small receiots and prediction of freezing
weather in Kansas had a strengthening Influ
ence on wheat prices at the opening to-day,
July being up a shade to M@Y*c, at 87%@
S7%c. Crop damage reports were- again in
evidence. In addition the information came
from the Northwest in regard to seeding .was
Ptlll bullish. ThÂ«? pit crowd was In humor to
listen to that kind of news. -and mattters of an
opjÂ»<?ite character were given scant attention
until after many of the bulls had bought what
whrat they could carry. That was done easily,
for there were few / orders from outside
traders. In the meantime the market 'had de
.veloped added firmn<*ss, the July delivery hav
ing- worked up to 87Vic. â¢ Toward the middle of
the session sentiment suddenly veered and the
market weakened rapidly. "The tauss of the
pronounced chance In sentiment was the an
nouncement that acreage in the' Northwest
would probably show a small Increase, not
withstanding an expected decrease. Several
of tjie larger commission houses had long wheat
for sale, and thPre was also some selling for
short account. The market lacked any influ
ential suDDort and continued weak until the
cloce. I After selling off to fctf%c, July closed at
87c. . .,Â¦
The most Important feature in ' trading in
corn was the selling of May . by the principal
holder, and a consequent decline of nearly 2
cents in the Drice of that delivery. The clos
ing was weak and near the low point. July
closed unchanged to %c lower, at 50c; May
was at 52Vic.
Oats showed considerable strength in the
face of the weakness in wheat and corn. July
clostd at 3S@3s^c.
Pit traders sold crovWons In >a small way
on the weakness in corn, which- resultefl In
small declines throughout the list. July pork
closed 12%c lower; lard, was off 5e, and ribs
werp off 7%c.
The leading futures ranared as follows:'

pressing effect on the sale of good fruit.- Yes
terday was shipping day for the Puget Sound
ports, but there was but little movement -in
that direction, as the -northern markets are
being supplied directly from the growing dis
tricts.: The auction sale was well attended,
but the prices obtained were low. as the offer

agers of the auction company were not inclined
to bid up prices, so the fruit was allowed to

15Black is 30 years old. He has served
eight years In Folsom for grand lar
ceny. He was released three months
ago.
When searched at the City Prison
four handkerchief masks, two revolv
ers, a tobacco .pouch filled -with car
tridges and. a large knife were found on
Black. The detectives assert that they
have positive evidence whereby they
will be enabled to connect Black with
the Mission robberies referred to. ,
In the . capture of Jack Black, alias
Tom Callahan, accomplished after a
desperate fight; in the presence of a
number of pedestrians on Eddy street,
between Powell and Mason, last night,
Detectives Freel and Bunner assert
that they have the Â¦ footpad that has
been terrorizing* the Mission for the
past month.
The detectives attribute to Black the
serious wounding of Elhammon J.
Treese, who, , while in company with
Mrs. Alberta Butler, was held up on
the night 'of March 26 on Twenty-sec
ond street^ 'near Dolores. Treese at
tempted to thwart the purpose of the
highwayman, by striking him with his
umbrella, whereupon the bandit opened
fire, seriously, .wounding Treese.
It is also charged that Black was the
highwayman that raided Knox's gro
cery, 876-8 Valencia street, a few
evenings after the shooting of Treese
and that he was one of the two high
waymen that â¢ engaged In a running
pistol battle with Policemen Walsh
and Skelly last Sunday night at Twen
ty-third and Dolores streets.
According to the story of the detec
tives, who have been working for some
time on the Mission hold-ups, the va
rious crimes were traced to the door
of Black,' who has been living at Twen
ty-second and Mission streets. The de
tectives -failed to catch Black at his
room, but after three days' work they
encountered him last night on Eddy
street.
When the officers attempted to place
the susoect under arrest Black drew a
revolver. Before he could make use of
the' weapon, however, the detectives
closed in on himf A desperate struggle
ensued, and Black was not 'subdued
until beaten almost into insensibility.

IIACKMEN'S STRIKE STILL- OX.
Owners and Drivers Both Say That
They Won't Give In.
The hackmen's fight is on in earnest
and only the cabbies that own their
rigs were seen^ on the Btreets yester
day. The stable owners declare they,
will hold out for an Indefinite period
and will make the drivers come to
terms.
The drivers feel confident, however,
that they can win out and claim that
already they have, gained a victory
over the owners.
Several owners, they claim, have
come over to their side and they are
more than pleased with the situation.
At a funeral yesterday an owner was
seated on the hearse and the. hack
man requested him to give way to a
union man. A member of the family of
the deceased, himself a union man, re
fused to allow a non-union man to
drive . at the funeral and i after some
argument the owner declared his loyal
ty to the union and the funeral pro
ceeded.
The hackmen say they are still will

from the State penitentiary, at San
Quentin. They had been taken f ro*m
prisoners entering the penitentiary
several years previous and had been
lying in a desk of the office of the
prison ever since. Secret Service men
make it a rule under their instructions
to confiscate all counterfeiting tools
and apparatus and send them to head
quarters at Washington, D. C, where
they are destroyed. The San Quentin
molds, Mr. Hazen says, were of the
finest make.
Mr. Hazen has written to the War
den of the State penitentiary at Fol
som to . surrender some molds and
other counterfeiting tools now in the
prison curio collection. He does not
think It proper that the penitentiaries
should be. converted Into kindergar
tens for counterfeiters.

TROUBLE IX -OAKLAND.
A communication was read from the
International Association of Carwork
ers of Chicago to the effect that they
are affiliated with the American Fed
eration of Labor. They state that the
international association has repeated
ly tried to form an affiliation with the
Brotherhood^ of Railway Carmen of
America, whose headquarters are in
Kansas, but that the Kansas associa
tion absolutely refuses to affiliate and
answers communications with the ut
most contempt.
An affiliation of the San Francisco
Sailors' Union with the Oregon State
Federation of Labor Is contemplated,
and D. W. Paul and J. V. Thompson
have been elected delegates (o repre
sent the SallonB* Union in the Northern
State. The ob'ject of the affiliation Is to
get more direct supervision over the
men whose work. calls them to travel
between here and the nqrth. It is hoped
that the affiliation will also bring about
more ' harmonious. , ; relations with the
headquarters in' this city.

despite the statements of the under
takers to the contrary.
At the meeting of the San Francisco
Labor Council last' evening Delegate
Bowlan of the Hack Drivers' and
Teamsters' Union took the floor, com
plaining thatf the executives of the
council had not treated his . union
squarely and that complaints from his
union were invariably ignored, while
complaints from other unions were al
ways looked into.
A heated argument arose and Bowlan
was ordered to sit down. A cry from
a hundred voices rang out "Sit Down,"
until the speaker's voice was drowned
by the din.
The chairman took a vote to ascer
tain how lone the speaker should Â¦ be
allowed to hold the floor. He was given
three minutes, and- through necessity
sat down before his plaint was fully
voiced.
CONTEMPT FROM KANSAS.
Santa Barbara is actively preparing
to receive the delegates and enthusiasm
runs high. It is supposed that every
county in the State will be well repre
sented, as the matter to be launched is
of vital interest to every good Callfor
nian.
Mrs. John Morrisey, -wife of the pop
ular manager of the Orpheum. left for
an extended trip through the East last
Sunday. She' went direct to St. Louis,
â¢where she will be present at the open
ing of the World's Fair, and will visit
New York, Washington and other East

On Tuesday afternoon the Camino
Real convention will meet in Santa
Barbara Â¦ to inaugurate an aggressive
campaign In California toward good
roads j and, primarily, for the recon
struction of the famous old highway
that ran from north to south through
the Stateâ El Camino Real.
The railroads have offered a round
trip rate of one and one-third of the
regular one-way rate to delegates and
accompanying visitors, and the hotels
have made corresponding reductions.
Delegates should request a receipt upon
purchase of their railway tickets, upon
the presentation of which hotel rates
can be secured.
CAMINO REAL
CONVENTION â¢
RATE FIXED
In the afternoon President Cornelius
and W. J3. Mahon, president of the
Amalgamated . Association of Street
and Electric Railway Employes, who
is here to watch the developments in
the controversy, went into conference
and discussed the various phases of
the situation for ! nearly two hours.
Each refused to make anything pub-
He afterward, nor would either dis
cuss what had transpired at the con
ference held in the morning.
Whether the company will again
take under consideration the statement
i>sued by the union on Thursday even
ing is not known, but it was under
stood that the conference of yesterday
was the final meeting between the two
contending parties pending either a
backdown by one of them or a declara
tion of war by the carmen.
At the United Railroads offices it
v/as intimated that the reply of Man
ager Chapman to the statement issued
by the carmen was the final disposition
of the matter so far as the company
was concerned. The representatives of
the company firmly reiterate that the
United Railroads will not recede from
its stand, and that the final disposi
tion of the matters at issue, whether
by strike or concessions, remains with
the Carmen's Union.
While the general impression given
out after the conference was to the
effect .that the meeting had no direct
bearing upon the question of whether
the carmen would inaugurate a strike
there was no effort among the car
men other than the union officials to
conceal their' belief that a strike' was
but a auestion of days, and that the
conference of yesterday, instead of
having had an alleviating effect, served
merely to widen the existing breach
almost to the unbridgeable point.
President Cornelius and Secretary
Bowling arrived at the offices of Man
ager Chapman shortly before 10:30
o'clock yesterday morning, and the two
interests at once proceeded to the
points at issue. The session lasted un
til long after noon, and at Its conclu
sion it was announced both at the rail
road office and at the headquarters of
the union that there would be no state
ment during the day.
CONFER TWO HOURS.
"The conference," he replied, "was
merely for the purpose of determining
a few minor disputes. What was their
nature? I cannot discuss that."
"The United Railroads has agreed
to concede certain minor points which
we desired settled," said Secretary-
Bowling after the conference.
"There was nothing of a conclusive
nature arrived at," asserted the com
pany representatives.
"Was there any discussion of the
vital questions at Issue?" was asked
of Secretary Bowling.
MINOR DISPUTES.
President Cornelius and Secretary
Bowling, representing the carmen, and
Manager Chapman and President Hol
land of the United Railroads, met In
conference yesterday.
While no definite conclusions were
reached at the meeting, beyond a few
minor concessions made on each ' side
regarding questions that have no real
bearing on the crucial situation, it is
understood that the conference was a
failure In so far as is concerned any
agreement that might eventually lead
to a settlement of the points at issue
without recourse to a trial of strength
between the forces of labor and capi
tal.
The Santa Fe Company Is preparing
to carry out a threat, made many
months ago, to make Sacramento a
terminal point of one of the California
divisions of its rapidly expanding
western system. Within the last six
months Its agents have been quietly
at work along the waters at the Junc
tion of the Sacramento and San Joa
culn rivers and up the former, secur
ing rights of way and surveys between
Martinez and Davis, with the undoubtr
ed purpose of gvtting Into the capital
of the State. Not only has the com
pany secured a strip of land along the
bay shore between Martinez and An
tioch, but It has secured an option on
en Island opposite Cornwall, which its
engineers are now surveying, with a
Mew of eventually establishing a car
ferry service across the mouths of the
two rivers. This ferry will be oper
ated in connection with a line which
the company purposes building along
the high ground back of Sulsun, to
Sacramento by way of Elmlra, Dixon,
or a point near there, and Davis.
The rights of way have been secured
by a. man named Buchanan, employed
by the Santa Fe. and they about tie
up the whole front on the eouth side
of the bay and river between Mar
tinez and Antioch. The Southern Pa
cific Company now controls the land
along the north side of the river,
which is paralleled by Its road to Sac
ramento. In acquiring its new rights
the Santa Fe will parallel the Southern
Pacific through a territory which that
company has held against all com
petition for manjj years and by con
necting with Its valley division near
Antioch and operating several boats
along the river, as It has already ar
ranged to do, the Santa Fe will be on
an equal footing with its competitor to
demand its share of the vast amount
of products annually shipped cut of
the fertile Sacramento Valley.
The delegates were hospitably enter
tained at the manse at luncheon and
dinner by the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Fisher.
The evening session was devoted to a
miscellaneous programme, beginning
with a praise service conducted by Mrs.
W.Â» J. Fisher. A recitation, "Child Life
in India," was given by Miss Myrtle
Kennedy of San Jose, and an address
on "Our Work Abroad â Mexico. Japan
and China," by Miss Aly M. Spencer.
MisÂ« Ina Jordan and Miss Mary Fisher
rendered the duet "Seek Ye the Lord"
(J. B. Roberts).
The election of a delegate to the
Woman's Missionary Convention, which
meets in Chicago May 12, resulted in the
unanimous choice of Mrs. B. F. Whit
temore of Mountain View, wife of the
Rev. B. F. Whittemore, stated clerk of
the presbytery and Pacific synod. Mrs.
W. J. Fisher was elected president of
the Woman's ' Presbyterial Missionary
Society; Mrs. E. J. Cooper, vice presi
dent; Mrs. F. P. Gray, corresponding
secretary and treasurer, and Mrs. I. G.
Kennedy, recording secretary.
At the close of the afternoon session
about 100 of those attending the delib
erations accompanied the Rev. W. J.
Fisher to the lots at Haight and Belve
dere streets, where the new Cumber-
In nd Presbyterian Church is to be
erected at a cost of $20,000.
LIVELY EVENING SESSION.
Frank M. Reed of Middletown. Cal.,
read an interesting paper on "The Prob
lems and Possibilities of the Christian
Endeavor Local Society."
Mrs. S. S. Phelps, president of the
Cumberland Presbyterian Chinese Mis
sion, presided at the afternoon deliber
ations, when Miss M. M. Crowder in
troduced several juvenile Chinese
wards from the Chinese mission, and
the Rev. J. P. Dixon delivered a ser
mon.
Rapt attention was given the read
ing of a paper by Miss Dell Hull of San
Jose on "The Enlargement of the
Christian Endeavor Society," in which
was treated the subjects of how and
why they should get new members and
the value and use of associated mem
bers.
HEAR
ABLE PAPERS.
Mrs. Gray said that there are many
Christian mothers who fail to train
their children in religion, and in some
cases there are mothers who lack Just
such training; hence the neglect in the
spiritual life of the child.
During the discussion of Christian
Endeavor the Rev. H. G. Culton. D. D.,
dwelt upon the probability of some
young r>eople concluding that the be
longing to the society meant "being in
it for a good time and for pleasure ex
cursions." If that was the thought, he
considered it a curse and heresy. Such
views, he thought, should be exposed
and placed in their proper light. To
those who had that idea he would say
that no one could come into the church
of Christ without coming up and out
of their sins. That was the object of
Christian Endeavor. L
Dr. Culton said further that "there
was a good time, but it was had in the
singing of praise and in the services
and in a sense of worthiness." He em
phasized his remarks by declaring that
the church is not a "social club."
FAIL TO TRAIN CHILDREN'.
The child of to-day, said Mrs. Whit
temore, must ultimately take up the
work which is now done by Its parents,
therefore she asked that mothers of
the community fit their children for the
religious responsibilities of life.
Women held sway at the third meet-
Ing of the annual gathering of the Cal
ifornia presbytery In Devlsadero Hall
yesterday.
One of the topics discussed was on
the "Junior Members of the Christian
Endeavor," "when Mrs. J. X. Crawford,
Mrs. Henderson, Mrs. J. H. Routte,
Mrs. L G. Kennedy, Mrs. W .J. Fisher.
Mrs. F. P. Gray, Mrs. Whittemore and
Mrs. Docker gave advice as to the
bringing up of children In the religious
life. It was agreed without exception
that home Is the place wherein the
child should receive Its first grounding
In all matters pertaining to church
work. v -~
Fortunately the car crossed Kearny
and Montgomery streets without ac
cident, and by that time the cars in
advance, h'aving been advised of the
danger behind them, availed, them
selves of the grade, cut loose from the
cable and began tobogganing toward
Jhe city front, tKereby increasing the
distance between themselves and the
Haight street car. . Meanwhile several
frightened women, aboard the runaway
car jumped from the platform of the
latter into the arms of willing rescuers
and a telephone message was sent to
the Valencia street engine house to
stop the cable, which was done Just as
the Haight-street car reached Main
street. There the grip was. released
from the v strand and the cable again
started, but unfortunately as the
snarled portion of the latter neared
the ferry it encountered car No. 262
of. the McAllister line and carrying it
forward dashed it into the rear part of
car 111 of the Castro street system.
In the collision the forward truck of
the McAllister street car was .-thrown
out of place and the rear platform of
the Castro street car was badly dam
aged. Again the engine house on Val
encia street was signaled to and th<*
cable was stopped until the wreckage
had been removed and the stray strand
cut from the cable. This work caused
a delay of nearly two hours, when
traffic was resumed on the various
branches of the cable system.
A snaggy strand in the Market street
cable played havoc with the passenger
traffic of the United Railroads late yes
terday afternoon and for a time put
the company out. of business.- At 5:20
o'clock, a Haight street car, traveling
eastward, picked up>a strand in the
cable opposite Fourth street and a sec
ond later the car was speeding toward
the Union depot at a lively clip. 'Â¦
The gripman,, quickly 'â realizing his
predicament, shouted ( a warning to the
car. in advance of him to keep moving
and frantically endeavored to shake
his grip" loose from the obstruction.
The strand- had. however, firmly tight
ened Itself on v the grip and all efforts
to cast it off Â¦ proved of no avail. As
the car proceeded >ln Its flight police
and pedestrians 'along the route pre
ceded it shouting to people to , keep
clear and between their cries arid the
clanging of the car bell many were
prompted to believe that the carmen's
strike was on and that a riot had de
veloped. -
