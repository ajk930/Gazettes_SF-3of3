a real fight to a finish, with all the ac- i
companiments-of a professional mill ex- â¢

of a scandal than anything in the his

of the regents.<many of whom are min-.;

pulled off In one of the recitation rooms
of the law school. -;> .V.^ .
In one of the bouts George H. Kelch,
a brilliant and husky young law stu- .
dent, was knocked out, cold and stiff,
by Charles Wilson, the crack football
man of the Methodist University. This
fight was refereed by J. .H. Summerfleld,,
an attorney of promise' and^at present,
assistant to the County, Coroner. ,
Another bout, between T. J v K.Mc-
Gowan andS. S. McCahill, was stopped
because it was" getting 'too." fierce and
hot and some one was in danger of get
ting hurt.vL The referee^bi'-thls scrap
was William KtieJin;' who, 'like all the ;
other participants, has entree to the
most exclusive set.
The mills were indirectly the result
of a session of mock court, in which all
the students -at the. law school partlcl- :
pated. The beaten side in a mock trial
suggested .that the winners could not
best them with the; gloves and ; the chal

Beef Magnates Claim That
They Were Promised Full

packers and 'agents: charged j with /being
promoters :of the ; so-called: ''beef, trust,'.'
In an additional plea in bar filed this af
ternoon by Attorney John IS.". Miller, the
packers' representative. The | new".. . plea,
which came as a complete surprise to the
Government, sets up as facts that -when
Commissioner Gar tie Id of the Department
of.< Commerce and ,- Labor .ln\ r estlgated the
beef business he promised - the | packers
that whatever -testimony they gave; with
out being-under oath or whatever docu
mentary â¢ evidence they volunteered 1 , the
defendants should: have -the ''same rights,
indemnities and immunities as if they had
testified under oath ': and compulsion.
.Under, this plea," Attorney Miller hopes
to establish the fact that â¢- there was an
agreement between the packers and the
Government that they â¢ should j testify and
produce evidence without being subpenaed.
or . the oath: being administered, but that
as ! far " as glmmunity'g Immunity' was concerned,' it
should be conslaered as If they had been
subpenaed and took the, oath. -: _Â« - 'â¢
:' The : allegation of an 'agreement between
Secretary^ Gar field and the packers was a
surprise to- District: Attorney "Morrison
and Assistant Attorney General â¢ Pagin.
It was said, to-night, that ' Secretary Gar
fleld has been \u25a0 asked Concerning j exactly
what occurred : during the Investigation
into the beef business. ;'.; '. '.
The plea alleges that the testimony and
evidence, it .was understood, ,, should ; not
be used by_ the Department of Justice in
any way as . a - basis for any prosecution
or proceedings against the 'defendants.;. \u25a0_
"Then; It is declared, ;. with*, the assurance
of :the Commissioner,: the defendants ap
peared before him and told concerning
the things to be Inquired': into and â¢; which
are now incorporated in the Indictment;
Notwithstanding the promises of the Gov

were given to the Department ' of Justice

MOTIVE FOX ATTACK
BY CHINESE UNKNOWN
Believed, That, Missionaries
Were -Killed by aXaw- ;
less Mob.
NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â The Presbyterian
Board of Foreign Missions to-day re
ceived a cablegram from Canton, China,
telling of the murder of the four Ameri
can missionaries and one- child at \u25a0 the
Presbyterian station, at Lienchqw, ne*rs of
which was received Mn a dispatch. .to the
press from HonukopÂ© yesterday. - The ca
blegram to the board-ifad ;as. follows:
Llenchow tUtlon has been! attacked. Mrs.
ilachle ' Alme (Mrs. Machle's daOghter), Mr.
PeVle ?'Mn l Wale and Che.tnut killed. Dr.
Machie and Patterson Â«aic Buildings de
stroyed. - .
The Chestnut referred to is Dr. Eleanor
Chestnut. .
: No motive which might have led the
Chinese to-murder'the American mission
aries is known by the iPresbyterlan Board
of Foreign Missions here. Rev. Dr. Ar
thur J. Brown, secretary of the board,
said to-day: r - , .. % \u25a0;,-
Letters from -the field 'during the past year,
have not Indicated any hostility or . cause for
alarm. The outbreak ,of violence Jhat * has ;
now. occurred can. hardly bave.been anUclpated.
OnÂ» k of the missionaries who was killed. Dr.
Eleanor Cliestnut. .wa.^ physician, who has
devoted herself ; for year* to mtnlsterlns to
the Blck r and Injured, and ehe was beloved
by multitudes who cared nothing for Chris
tianity. Of the others one was the wife and
anothlr the daughter of a physician. C.
E Machle, and the other two. Rev. and Mrs.
John Rogers Peale. were new mleslonaries,
who left this country August 16 and had been
In Llenchow only a few days. It therefore
appears probable that the attack was made
by some mob which had gathered for another
purpose and which gave lawless Characters, an
opportunity for plunder and bloodshed.
It should, bemadded., however, that nearly
all * the Chinese in * the United States haye
come from the province of \u25a0 KÂ«Â«nittÃnÂ«. in
which Llenchow- Is situated, and reports Of
their treatment here have greatly exasperated
many of the. people. The letters of the mla-
Monaries howler, have not indicated any ln
te"ferGnce with. their work or any .disposition
on the part of the people to molest . them. -
Under these circumstances it appears that
the attack was made by some- among that
teeming population who did not persona ly.
know It thTcharacter and work of,, the mis
sionaries. * ,-. . . - M ; â¢

United States, Frarce and Great Brit
ain for some time. The.American and
British Ministers at Caracas have pro
tested, but the French Charge ' d'Af
faires has not proi-isted, owing to the
interruption of. diplomatic relations be
tween France and Venezuela. The off.
cials here understand that the Ameri-.
car. Minister volctÂ«l .the protest ;of
France. The suspension occurred "yes
terday or the day before, and Jascjd a
day.
The ground for. the suspension was
that the/ Venezuelan Government had
not received a reply .to a cablevnies-.
sago sent to an agont abroad. Presi
dent Castro ' attributed [ the"; non-receipt
of a reply. to foreign influences.
The authorities here say the inci
dent is an additional provocation, but
that this does not change'their'inten
tion not to adopt coercive measures
I until no chance retrains of securing^ a
pacific adjustment.
The official reports further say that

v WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â Rear Admir
al Charles W. Rae,*engltieer-in-chlef of
the United States navy, .in his annual
report requests appropriations for : the
navy yard at Mare Island. for. the.con
struction of a foundry, smithies, boiler
shops, coppersmith' shop, pattern -shop
and administration buildings.r The
commandant ,at the ..'Mare Island 1 , yard
is quoted as saying the present boiler
shop there is a menace to the safety of
some of the boilermakers. ;. . â¢ : -
For the Puget Sound, navy yard'es-.
timates are 'requested" for a pattern'
shop and administration building
$50,000 is requested for the Cavite sta T
lion.-. .
Admiral Rae" calls attention to "the
critical condition of engineering In the
navy" and points to the explosion on
the* gunboat Bennington in 'San Diego
harbor, which, he says,- most forcibly
emphasizes the necesslty.of serious and
immediate attention. Speaking of the
operations of the, personnel bill; which
merges the corps of engineers into the
line of 'the navy, he says a corps of
specialists was virtually" abolished'and
their duties transferred to the line. As
all 'midshipmen at the academy . had
been given excellent personal instruc
tion ' in engineering, he adds, no ex :
amination other .than that .required for
promotion Is demanded of them for.
qualifying for- the performance* of the
joint duties imposed by the "personnel
act. The intent, however, he continues,
was that they should -be; ordered [at
once" to the performance' of engineer,
duty in -subordinate capacities as as
sistants' to the '"older .engineer # offlcers.
SITUATION ALARMIXG
"Owing to the absence of specific in
structions in the personnel bill, com
bined with powerful- adverse [Influences
within the department." he continues,
"for â¢ three years absolutely notning
was done by the younger officers to
ward acquiring engineering experience,
and later, owing to the large number
of ships kept in command 'and the
scarcity of offices, but little In that di
rection was accomplished."
"So few 'officers /Of tiie:line;are'tak
ing 'up engineering , seriously that the
situation :is becoming "alarming," says
the engineer-in-chief, '.and'hc adds: V
Were the country, suddenly plunged Into war.
the naVy would rind itself In no condition- to
win battle*. As necessary as good 'marksman
ship lÂ«. the ability to carry cut guns to the
firing- line and to keen them' there amid the
havoc created by , modern ordnancu; and this
will never be done wlth-amateurs In charge of
the machinery. That line officers can" become
Rood ; engineers has already been proved/but
they mubt.have experience to ' become so.- and
that experience must b? acquired In subordinate
positions.'. No young officer out of the acad
emy but a \ short tlrru?, ' who would not be
given charge of the deck except under- the
supervision of a senior orrtcer. should 'be
placed in charge of the engine department of
a ship as has beÂ«Â»ri done: EnKltieerlng logi
cally be loiiks to the line, and the. line should
be made to ' perform that duty earnestly.
â¢ \E\V PI.AA i SUGUESTKP.
Admiral Rae "submits a plan "for*
quickly supplying the navy with a
body of efficient engineers" which pro
vides that all the younger officers must
be given .engineering duty and be made
to realize their responsibility, the duty
to be performed tlrst'in a subordinate
capacity and examinations to be strict,
engineering ranking, with -marksman-;
ship', gunnery and /navigation. Further,
the plan provides^for v number of en
gineering specialists, in the line, whose
duty at seaand on shore shall be en
gineering, .such officers riot to perform
sea duty after reaching the grade (of
commander.- 'One (in- every ten ('\u25a0 above
the rank of i lieu tenant; junior grade,, is
suggested* as the number of such; offi-"
cers required, and lt| is proposed, that
such officers be recruited. from the" foot
of the list of lieutenants, the officers
so selected to be' given a course In
higher marine engineering for at. least
a.yeaf.'.'**' â¢ â¢ . ;V; V
This plan, it is explained, would
give a body of engineering specialists
as follows: Two. rear admirals. ': seven
captains, .eleven' commandors, i twenty
nine lieutenant commanders ;and ' thlr
â¢ty-fpur lieutenants," ; of which number
sixty-two would be available-; for â¢- sea'
duty.' ' . ,
Admiral Rae says the bureau -is op
posed to the forma tion of .a \ separa to

to that abolished- by the personnel. a:^t

our city governm'fent for the last four
years is largely responsible for our
slow and unsatisfactory growth; for
we know, and It is known all over this
country that we have a government
with which is arrayed every lawless,
idle and dissolute element in the corny
munity.'ahd a government which -has
frequently appointed to positions of the
greatest public trust and responsibility
unworthy and Incompetent persons.
The knowledge that we have such a
government is not conducive to our
city's prosperity. It frightens away
capital and it impairs our credit. We
see its evil results here in retarded
growth and impaired credit. This im
paired credit prevents _ the sale of our
city bonds for street and sewer im
provement. As a result ;the improve
ment of our city and the expenditure
of millions In the . profitable em
ployment of labor is made impossible.
SAX FRANCISCO'S DILEMMA.
â¢'It is time that' those who have
proporty interests in this city and all
those who have her welfare at heart
awake to a realization of our predic
ament. We have fallen behind, but we
still have a glorious opportunity^- Our
future greatness is assured if we do
our part and do not retard its coming.
Fifty years ago it was predicted that
here, would be one of the greatest cit
ies in the world. A prophetic eye
saw the trade with the Orient assum
ing vast proportions with the awaken
ing Oriental nations. It saw, as a re
sult, the commerce of the Atlantic be
ing transferred to the Pacific. . . It ;saw
the I United States -becoming a. world
power and .seizing its opportunity, and
it was prophesied, as .a result of all
these factors, that an unparalleled
growth would be seen in San Fran
cisco... After waiting fifty years . all
these- things have ' recently come, , to
pass. With them has come our oppor
tunity. Already "we have felt the im
petus of the upward movement: but
it has barely begun. If not arrested it
should, fere lor.g, givÂ« to this city a
million inhabitants. It should increase
â¢all property values many fold, for the
eyes of .investors all over this country
are turned toward San Francisco, and
millions upon ir.tllions are ready to be
Invested here, s.s it is recognized that
no city in tho United States has the
possibilities of development in the next
twenty years that San Francisco has.
"But what must we do in order to
make sure of that which is rightfully
ours? Surely v/e do not desire to so
act as' to drive to our rival cities cap
ital which would come here. We can
not be so blind to our own interests.
â¢The interests of all classes are here
Identical. The wage earner, the mem
ber of a trade union is as much inter
ested in' the prosperity of his city as is
the owner of property. Who more than
the va?e earner is interested In seeing
capital attracted to be invested in
manufacturing enterprises and in the
erection -of Improvements? Does this
all not furnish steady and profitable"
employment for labor? â¢ We must, then,
irrespective of class, unite- in setting
up a government "whfch will restore
confidence; which will build up our Im
paired credit, and which will invite
not rerjejâ capital. If we do this we
will secure . the, full measure: of our
.greatness . and prosperity,; and . we will
then soon take the proud position
which Is rightfully ours.
"We are fortunate in having, as a
candidate for Mayor a man on whom
â¢all classes can safely unite, whether
working men or capitalists; a man of
honor and ability; a man whose elec
tion will bring success and good repute
to" our city, prosperity to our property
owners and contentment to our wage
earners â John BS. Partridge, the rtext
Mayor at San Francisco.",

name â¢ and â¢ the crowd immediately
caught it up In a mighty roar that only
dfed away when the candidate was
seated on the platform. When, pre

uninterrupted several minutes. After
quiet was restored he spoke as. fol
lows: .

ir.tnts I have already raaCe. All that I have
paid I etand for: and everything I have prom

been made upon me have but etrengthened my
determination to eliminate politic* from tha
city government and conduct our cirlc af
fairs on a business basis.
Now the -prosperity of .a city/llfee that of a
firm or Individual, depends ' largely upon lv
reputation. So our, first task must bÂ« to re
ors&size all the commissions upon such a basis
that net even a breath or suspicion can touch
them. To. that end. even here in advance of

While the speaker was still on bis I

creed or party they say that which is false.
The'admintstration, here on the eve of elec
tion, is making some sudden show' of diligence.
Does the Mayor of thls.elty think the pecple
are all cflildrenâ <h*at they cannot see'thrcugn
hU death-bed repegtance-? WÂ« criticize him
for not- building^ the schoolhouses, though the
money has been available- for months, and
forthwith he. announces that the schools shaJ l
be built. Why wre they not built .before?.
Children liave been housed In election booths,
and in all sorts of ramshackle buildings, and
not 'even a beginning made .toward the neiy
Bchoolhouses. Does the Mayor think he can
(il.-arm criticsm by declaring - that ha will be
diligent now. If we will forgive him for the
remlsaness \u25a0of the past?
We called the people's attention to the
fact that no real effort had. been jnade to con
struct the Geary-street road; but that., on the
contrary, the Mayor had hampered it in every
way. ThÂ«> Very next night he announces that
he will cause work to be begun before election
day.- is tbat going to fool anybody?
The' world is apt to bfc cynical . when" men
become Virtuous under pressure* We always
have our suspicions when a man reforms be
cause he iis . afraid. And the .people of San
Francisco will record .their opinion of an ad
ministration whhih seeks, 'to accomplish in the
few weejts before election work which has
been neglected for the best part, of Its term.
The "Mayor's. piAcard3 and speeches boast of
the prosperity of the. city. Bat the whole
coast, the whole country 13 prosperous. Tn#
question to be "considered Is not whether San
Francisco is prosperous, but whether she wouldk
be more prosperous under a fair, liberal busl-Â»
ness 'administration. Our recent ' prosperity
\u25a0began with the Spanish war. The attention of
the world was directed here' and the world
became aware of our tremendous natural ad
vantages. At the same time a period of im
mense industrial and commercial . activity set
in all over the country." and natnrally we
got our share of it. But since Ure .present
administration has been In power the country
has become, distrustful of us. As a result,
though we have grown we have not kept
pace proportionately with other cities on the
coast â¢ which cannot compare with San Fran
cisco In any way. "We don't want anything
to hamper the splendid .future - of this city.
We can grow and prosper under a' disgraced
and discredited and Inefficient administration,
but why shockl we? So let's give San Fran
cisco the best we can. Let's remove the only
impediment to her growth.

Mayor Schmltz Â«nd the rest of tha
candidates- on the Union -Labor party
ticket are bending: their Â©very -energy
during: these last few days of the mu
nicipal campaign to the securing- of
every possible vote for themselves.
They maintain that' the election of the
Mayor and a straight ticket Is a cer
tainty, yet with the next breath, they
urge every wage-earner to capture at
least another vote for the Ruef ticket.
Meetings are being held In every part
of the city In the hope of. bringing
victory to their standard, and yet. in
spite of their boastful claims of great
majorities, the Impression Is steadily
growing that the candidates are fear
ful as to the outcome on November 7.
Last sight the Mayor spoke at four
crowded meeting's. The first was held
at Masonic Hall, Fourteenth street and
Railroad avenue. * Harmony Hall was
the next stop. At Washlngton-sQuare
Hall he was given an ovation. .The
final meeting was held at Electricians'
Hall. Here P. H. McCarthy paid a
fluent tribute to the character and
power of Mayor Bchmltz and hailed
Mm as the next Governor of California.
It would seem that the Mayor has
again let his ambitions sprout and

future chief , executive of the State.

BIG AUDIENCE
Tells of Pitfalls in the
City Where Weak Women
Go to Meet Their' Ruin
ARRAIGNS THE MAYOR-
Declares Schmitz Is Not an
American Because of His
Drawing the Class Line
"Good Citizenship" was the theme of
discussion at the seventy-flfth quar
terly convention of Golden Gate Chris
tian Endeavor Union at the United
Presbyterian Church, Golden Gate ave
nue and Polk street, yesterday. W. F.
Ellis presided over the afternoon ses
sion, which was attended by more than
200 members.
The most important address was
made at the evening session, when Rev.
S. J. Patterson spoke on the evils that
at present beset this city and arraigned
those who, are responsible for mem.
In view of all the Iniquities that ex
isted, he said it would be a "mortal
sin" to vote for the present Mayor.
G. H. Greenwell, M. D.. spoke in the
afternoon on "The Good Citizen â As a
City Official," and in part said:
It It blgb time that the good citizen should
bestir himself, should be lound at the head
of things and not lurking In the background.
From ona end of this city to the otbei
tha good people should be seeking relief from
corrupt political, social and economic condi
tions.
All these movements which are thrilling the
City at this time are encouraging signs of a
crowlnx determination under the evil con
ditions. > \
The time has come when Christian men must
lead and not be led around by evil and
designing political tricksters.
All political bosses have the same facial
appearance to me; therefore It behooves the
(rood people, of this Union to exercise theii
privileges and franchise, inherited from out
forefathers, who bought It by their blood In
177* and whose examples are being Imitated
by tbÂ» populace of Russia to-day.
A Mayor, a Supervisor, a Police Judge, has
.no right to sit-in office for any other busi
ness than for that which God sits on his
thront.
The city official should stand for what
Christ stood for: whatever would ' have been
Â» rorjg for Christ should be wrong for the city
official. If It would have .been wrong foi
Jesus to keep a saloon -it -Is surely wron&
for a city to protect a saloon.
12 the city and State would develop its
possibilities It must turn from Its political
machines Â«.nd reach forth to realize the life
of Jesus, by and through the Christian citizen,
who must, become a leader and not -a followerâ
not for' what there Is In It, but for the
welfare and wellbelng of the whole.
The rood citizen as a city official should
â¢tana for justice and equality, equal rights
for a.: I, special privileges for none.
Think of all the vice and shame existing
under the protection of our city government.
. Say you not that -we need the good citizen
in the official position, that righteousness
may prtvall and that sin may forever hid*

' PATTERSON MOVES HEAHEHS.
In- the evening the church, which has
& seating capacity of 900, was almost
filled- and 1 among the speakers was the
Bey. S. J. Patterson. . His subject was
"The j.i-lation of the Church to Civic
Righteousness," in which he 'admitted
that -while the church has no right in
politics there came occasions when it
was the duty of the pastor to speak out
for morality and against the pitfalls
which were proved to be a menace to
the youth and good name of a city.
Wherever the church had interfered
in- politics it had made "an instant mess
of it," but. that did not say that the
congregations 'should not consider the
lives of the men who were candidates
for public office.
He was thankful that the -public
men of to-day, and he Included the men
of national affairs, did not fear, as of
old, to mention the name of God; and
instanced President Roosevelt as one
who went* through thÂ»" country and
gave better sermons than many occupy
ing the pulpit. The President, he said,
was a man who looked another man in
the eye and let him know he believed
in God, fend he was doing more, almost,
than any other man in the -country for
righteousness.
Rev. Mr. "Patterson, in treating, on
the subject of the coming election, de
clared that it was not based on party
politics, but on social lines. There
was a Union Labor and not a "laboring"
ticket, and thus Â£he voters were
brought to face a question, of "class."
He disclaimed knowing Mayor Schmitz
personally, and, while he might be a
good man. Rev. Mr. Patterson claimed
the right as an American - citizen to
criticize fThe officer, who was not benefit
ing the community.
SCHMITZ NOT AMERICAN".
Rev. Mr. Patterson denied, that Mayor
Schmits Is an American citizen, charging
him with hot showing the American spirit.
He was doing something, said Mr. Patter
son, that never entered American poli
ticsâdrawing . a class line and making
"class" a party question, thus tending to
bring disruption in social conditions.
To show, that he himself had tasted of
the -bitters of poverty the sneaker I told
how he had walked the streets of San
Francisco one winter without a dollar in
his pocket. He had known what it is to
toil, for he had been j huefore the mast,
and subsequently eight men in his class,
studying for the ministry, to which they
felt they had a call, came from the work
shop.
The speaker maintained that this coun
tr>\ where the poor man's son- has every
opportunity if he wills, this country,
working up to a state of perfection, Is
not .going to be bettered by this raising
of class spirit.
Mayor , Scbmitz, said Rev. Mr. Patter
son, dared draw the line and divide the
people, and, while. there were as good men
as ever came to this country who will
vote for Mayor Schmitz, he charged that
the Mayor was making his canvass also
among people who are not moral and
have not the welfare of the city at heart.
The divine referred his hearers to the
Schmitz jsigns over the doors of dives and.
groggerles. and said if tney loved God.ifj
they loved their church, if they.:> loved
their innocent daughters; their innocent
eistcrs, they should not vote f(?r Mayor
Schmitz, because, he lends his "aid to the
forces which 'damn thousands of girls"a
year In this city. . ' .
- In view of all thatÂ»;to vote for him, said
Rev. Patterson, would* be a mortal sin
and the man who votes for him "ought
Xo go to hell."
- TELLS OF THE* PITFALLS.
The speaker said then ttiat. the labor
unions haa no more ..business to . enter
politics than had the church and if a*
man s unionism overrides his morality he.
thought? he, had , better .*\u25a0 give it up. \u25a0":' \u25a0
Rev., Patterson -described the "pitfalls
in! the' city wherein the weak' women are
lost;, where women "are ! made drunk,": and
asked them to think of "these "conditions.
By casting their votes fop civic; right
eousness his. hearers would make It eas
ier ; forÂ°the moral wave which was sweep-
Ing over the nation to roll, r the; speaker
said. o He instanced ' the change", tori pur
fty. which had spread ~ over ':. New vTork,
where Jerome is ' making ..the fight;' \n
Philadelphia and, â¢ Minneapolis, where
there had tfeen a ''cleaning out" and the
atmosphere. cleansed and wheth
er San Francisco 'was to lag In the pro T '

Rev.' Patterson called. upon his hearers
to - put \u25a0 out 'i the '\u25a0\u25a0 men who^ had ; practiced
corruption, to "breathe" the' spirit: of their
forefathers,- and -be- prayed J thatiGod

had forced the board to discover dirt,
pus and the like in all the samples, while
the same milk a morith before was found
only to be deficient in butter fati ;"\u25a0'\u25a0,
Dr. Dillon then . told of the unsanitary
plumbing In the homes of the poor and
how his threats and , cajoleries of the
owners were set at naught because - the
owners were protected by a boss to whom
they paid monthly tribute. He nailed the
Ruef lie that he was not asked to run
on the labor ticket this , time and said
that he was asked and refused to take a
nomination. He closed with an appeal to
the laboring men for whom he has
worked and towhom he has devoted his
life and service to realize the difference
between honest administration and graft
and vote. for the fusion ticket. from top
to bottom.:.; r:':
Chairman Kierce then Introduced In
surance Commissioner E. Myron Wolf.
Mr. Wolf told of the. force of public
opinion and how the forces of honesty
once . aroused are throttling the forces
of graft throughout the country. "He
said that graft is graft, wether in' an
insurance company, or in a street con
tract or In a branch of the civil govern
ment. He described the opposition to
graft as slow of beginning, but irresist
ible in its power to crush corruption. ;
In closing Mr. Wolf predicted, the plac
ing In the Mayor's chair by the voters on
Tuesday next the peerless John S. Part
ridge and the advancement of San Fran
cisco as a city properly governed. .. He
said that in Partridge the city would find
the kind of man' she needs for chief ex
ecutive and that no tainted meat or im
pure milk will be sold.
PLEA FOR BRAIIXH.IRT.
The next speaker was Robert J. I^ough
ery, who made a magnificent plea for
the support of the voters in behalf of
Samuel Braunhart, who Is sick In a hos
pital. He further reveiwed the fusion
ticket and told of the work of the men on
the ticket In behalf of labor and , added
that there were more true friends of
labor on the fusion ticket than on the
â¢ Union Labor ticket. He closed with a
call for three cheers for Braunhart,
which were heartily given. .
Frank H." Gould then followed Mr.
Partridge with a stirring address regard-
Ing the importance, of .the office of Dis
trict Attorney and the fitness of Mr.
Brandenstein for the position over his op
ponent. Gould paid a high tribute to
Brandenstein and spoke well of Langdon
In his capacity as, School Superintendent,
but 'said' that the District Attorney's of
fice was a place for a man tried in law
and not for a beginner.
The last speaker of the evening was
the candidate for District Attorney,
Henry U. , Brandenstein. He ridiculed the
Idea that there was a real issue to the
campaign except to crush the grafters
and said that the forces of Republicanism
and Democracy were arrayed against two
Immoral pygmies, against men -of ; v no
standing, and unfortunately the labor Is
sue was imported into the campaign.
They are champions of he j de
clared, defenders of nothing and offend
ers of everything. In conclusion he asked
his. hearers if they, honestly believed that
either Ruef or Schmitz ever, lost a min
ute's sleep in worrying over the cause
of labor. ;C^ 7

â¢ Broken Off: ,
Miss Fisher ' Says
VeFde Is Beyond \
Her Years
OAKLAND, Nov. 2.â After airthe prep
arations for the weddins had been com
pleted and the marriage license secured,
the engagement of Miss Marie M.. Fisher,
aged fifteen years, who. resides with her
parents at 146S Third street, and Viscount
de Villa Verde, has been definitely ended
by the refusal of the girl to marry a man
more than twice her own age. The wed
ding had been sat for next Wednesday,
but this morning the girl decided that
she would rather lose her chance of be
coming a. Viscountess of Portugal than to
spend her life with a man old enough to
be her father.- ._ -\u0084 . *i, .
. Immediately after he had been Informed
of Miss Fisher's., decision the Viscount
left the Fisher home, declaring, it is said,
that none. of the family would ever see
him again. Manuel Fisher, the father of
the girl, jsaid this afternoon that he had
left tbe matter', entirely with his daugh
ter, and that her decision was final. .
luquiry at the . home pi Mrs. Ferris,
Fifth and>Henry. streets., elicited the in
formation that the Viscount hadleftr the
house early in the day, saying t^hat he
was going to San Francisco. Miss Fisher
said that when he left her -home he had
told her "that he would not be seen' after
two hours."' ' V \u25a0 \u25a0
The Viscount's remark that he "would
not be seen after two hours" was taken
to mean that he intended to end his
earthly woes, but this could not have
been the case, for he appeared at The
Call office last night, saying he wished to
announce that he was exactly what he
represented himself to be. He left, say
ing he was going back to-Oakland.
BEGS FROM POLICE JUDGE.

rJturned only recently, from a year's study in
New York, under the chaperonage of Mrs.
Beatrice - Priest . Fine, the -popular- singer. â¢It
was while. there that she met Paul Armstrong,
the playwright, who was -so pleased with her
character work that he "padded" the part of

would rather . make " her first professional ap

will make' her initial appearance here as Polly
In "The Optimist." Miss Bradley is a great
social favorite, and her many friends will

BANK OF CALIFORNIA TO BUILD
STRUCTURE OF ROMAN TYPE.
Directors Adopt PJans for Modern Improvements on the North
west Corner of California and 1 Sansome 'Streets.
NEW BUILDING WHICH THE BANK' OF QAX.IFORNIA WILL. ERECT ON SITE OF ITS STRUCTURE AT CALIFORNIA AND
SANSOME STREETS. THD IMPOSING EDIFICE WILL BE OCCUPIED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE BANK AND OFFI
CERS.- TEMPORARY QUARTERS WILL BE ESTABLISHED AT CALIFORNIA AND LEIDESDORFF STREETS. -
The Bank of California directors have
decided upon the form of the' new' bank
structure th,at 'will be erected on the (
northwest corner of California and San
f-ome streets -to replace the historical
one that has been a landmark in that
yioinity for many years. Contrary to
general expectations, the new building
will not.be for office and banking pur
poses combined, with many stories
towering jfoigh above its surroundings,
but will be exclusively for the uses of
the banking corporation and will not
loom up as a skyscraper. A picture,
prepared at the direction of Bliss &
Faville. the architects, shows that the
general effect will be artistic -and im
posing.
With the land purchased some
.months ago "from the White Investment
Company, otherwise the Newhall broth
ers,, the Bank of California now owns
at the northwest corner of California
and San Some streets 87:6. feet frontage
on California, street, 124 feet on San
some and 87:6 feet on Halleck. The
banking building to . be erected will
completely fill these frontages and
cover the area inclosed by these boun
daries.
The general eff.ect will be of a one
story building, ; the classical designs and
the detail of- which ,are taken from
ruins foOnd in the Roman Forum. The
scheme is of a colonnade of Corin
thian columns, filled between . with
bronze grilles and glass to admit light.
The material is to be California granite.
The heighj; to the balustrade is to bo
seventy feet. The interior is" to be one
.large banking room, covering- the full
dimensions of the building lot, and with
a height of fifty feet. Above the bank
ing room, but hidden by the balustrade,
will be two rows of offices for the ac
commodation of the officials and for
various departments connected with
the bank. These will be reached both
by an electric elevator and. by a stair
case. The interior finish of the entire
bank structure will -be of marble and
mahogany. To be in harmony modern
furniture of the" best designs will be
installed.
The decision of thÂ« bank officials to
build only for. banking use is said to
have.been partly suggested by the prac
tice prevailing for a few years past in
large- Eastern centers of population.
Another consideration was the unde
sirabillty of tying up a large amount
of bank capital in a building. The
Bank of California- purchased the Lon
don- and San Frandisco Bank some
months ago. While the new bpnstruc
tion Is- progressing the former will oc
cupy the old premises. -of the latter at
the northwest' corner of California and
Leidesdofff streets. The demolition and
removal of the--. building now occupied
by the " Bank Q*f California will be
started "early in January... All speed
possible will be used. thereafter in sup
plying the, banking cor.pora.tlon with" a
new. and elegant home.

AMERICAN INFLUENCE ON RUSSIA. â¢
WITTE is.the man of the hour in Russia. To be Premier of all
great Russia at this hour, of crisis is to hold the center of the
world stage. Instantly as he steps into that position of vast
tfust* and power he calls out eloquently across continents and oceans
for the support of the American people and of the press which
voices^ the wish of lhat people. It is a moral support, of course,
that -|ie asksâ the sustaining influence of an enthusiastic and sane
opinion.' It-is a characteristic of. true greatness to seek enlightened
mpral backing for any momentous change. The place to get it is
especially when it relates to the matter of liberty, whereof
Â«we''frbld alpft the torch to all the world.
â¢ -If is not .merely as a courtesy that Russia's man of the hour
â¢ Sends his message to the American press and people. He knows
that -civilization .is progressing ever to higher planes of conflict
'\vhere the opinions of the best minds count for more than cannon.
He calls to us now to. indorse his stand, not only for freedom, but
conservatism in the methods of founding that freedom. The free
dom from autocracy is now assured. That issue is settled; but the
; new issue now trembling in the balance, and which he wishes
'American moral influence to help determine, is if the Witte plan
JDf -a peaceful, orderly, conservative arrangement for civil liberty is
to prevail, or if there is to be a complete revolution accomplished
[by more or less of fratricidal turmoil and domestic war.
The. new Premiers appeal is to the moderates; what he. fears
â¢ now is not the power of the autocrats â that is broken, but the delay
or defeat of his plans by the rebellion of the radicals, the socialists
and the so-called anarchists. That the American press and public
twill respond acquiescently to Witte's appeal to their good wishes
that the Russian people will be 'persuaded to co-operate with the
â¢ established government in the peaceful securing of the benefits of
ireedom is most likely. For America stands for liberty, and not for
.liberty run .mad into license. It .is well to have a strong central
government .to enforce law and order, and to bring in reform in an
orderly way.' There will be rampant, fanatical lovers of liberty who
â¢would destroy the tru'fr value of- the thing by grasping greedily for
too much of it. These will need to be held in check.
' 0 While Americans will rejoice in the new liberty given to the
\u25a0 Russians, 'we cannot Tjut Temember the vast amount of ignorance
/and prejudice there is still among them. There are provinces where
the temporary Cessation of the power of the centralized government
< ;would be a signal of prejudiced hordes to break loose in pillage and
massacre of Jews. Witte, whose wife is a Jewess, can keenly ap
cprcciate that danger. The mechanism of a new system of govern
ment could not be swiftly enough to -avoid mob rule
that would be "worse than autocracy. ..Let the moderates control the
situation, and the American people morally uphold *th<? hands of
AVitte, at least Until the sincerity and ability of the new Premier's
- promise of freedom is fairly tested. â¢
CENTRAL AMERICAN FINANCE.
'â¢\u25a0'Hp HE. greatest embarrassment in. dealing with the Central Amer-
I ican \u25a0 countries is caused by . the nature of their currency, and
/â¢ .the vast fluctuations, of -exchange'. Some of those countries are
< 'eh a silver basis and some are on no basis at all. In Guatemala
:*'monada nacional" is the basis, and the national moeny is a terri-
Wy depreciated 'paper Currency, ' worth about a. dollar <a. bushetfin
c United States gojd. \u25a0 In Colombia a gold dollar exchanges for about
$1560. in the national' money. There are. many foreign holders of
the b.onds of those .countries who arc- in despair. Their plight is
shared by other foreigners who hold, adjudicated claims for various
spoliations of property,. -South' of Mexico there seem to be no finan
cial statesmen capable of working out. a remedy-.and.applying.it.
Other countries, which 'export to those states, find the trade
\ risky; because, the rate of exchange is so easily affected that it falls
at the firing of a gun that- may mean- revolution or at a change of
rulers, which may mean a- fresh emrssion .of worthless paper.
c* . Compared -with the financial system and situation in those
States, the Chinese. system, with its. numerous tads of different
values and all legal tender and- the basis of valuation of exported
goods, is soundness" and.. simplicity. .Mexico- has heretofore suffered
from. like causes, but to a less degree, because she .did* maintain
the silver standard-, and suffered only from fluctuations in the price
"^of the fine bullion of that metal, which of course was reflected in
the * rate of.- exchange. . â¢ ' ; -. ." â¢
- L But Mexico has long had stability of government,, and her
. economic, situation ..-has constantly improved. President Diaz has
-been friendly to< American .-wtferprise, and at last has followed our
example by adopting- the' gold', standard. The Government mint
'}\u25a0 will soon begin the .coinage of .gold, and we will have a close neigh
bor living' under the same standard of value.' The -change from
the silver to the gold standard has been effected- without the slight
est loss or confusion. Exchange has steadied and all' the commerce
C*Â«f the country feels' the h.eaithy .impulse of the change. ' â¢
. * ' Unfortunately Mexico is regarded with distrust and disfavor by
the other Central. American* countries. What they fear is conquest
- by their grooving northern- neighbor. What they fear would be im
measurably to their. advantage. If Mexico owned the whole isthmus
of Darien to the Venezuela-a'and Ecuadorian line it would be better
for the masses of the people and immeasurably better for the com
rnerce r .of- the' world- â¢ .Only the ruling politicians, of those petty
states would suffer.- Their revolutionary changes of government
would have to cease and their opportunity to plunder the exchequer
e woujd disappear. .' '-.-â¢:
. c< Mexico has' a population of 15-,0q0,000. Th.c seven. nations south
' of 'he'r^ to the "Venezuela border have an. aggregate population ot
, only 8,000,000. ; "If these' populations^ were combined under one gov
ernment and that as enlightened .as Diaz has given to Mexico, with
sound finance-, a well regulated exchequer- and an honest budget,
c honestly , expended, there would rise 'a state of very great promise,
"Vure to increase- in "population, power and" position. Mexico seems'
to c have* been-, perhaps, .unconsciously',- preparing the way to such
0 expansion and absorption 'and to have now taken the last prepara
tory step in. 'adopting the gold standard and putting her credit in an
c irnprÂ£gnabltf condition.- She. could easily take over the small states,
their people, resources and debts and make them part of a great
\u25a0 # nation. 0 .'.â¢â¢*â¢
Guatemala has long watched Mexico in the fear of absorption,
Â» and- at the same .time lias made absorption more necessary by utter
.neglect of the internal conditions which make for national strength.
We by rio'ineans believe that 'a few countries have a mission
c .to -govern the whole; world by a sort of government trust. But it is
6 economic waste to maintain the seven separate governments which
"^<ifyide-the country between Mexico and Venezuela. The people-all
speak the same language, are of common ' descent and are in all
things homogeneous except in government.

THE; SAN FRANeiSGO^GALL^y FRIDAY^ ;NOVEMBER^3; :;I9OS'
WHAT IS IN EVIDENCE.
THE struggle for a better city government his been a campaign of disclosures*
Against the air-tight secrecy and the ropen use; of \u25a0 eyery.i official â¢ -it is
disclosed that Mr.Kuef is the actual administration. He is under every pile of
municipal dirt. Poke^vhere you please and he squeals. Theirrand Jury felt of^blie sit
jiatiou and jlublisliM what it felt. Imiuediat^iy>^M
the Grand Jury. The Republican; League was formed and pushed its quest, and in due
time published its verdict agaiiist the : ; conditions it found. At once Mr. Kuef' looked
his head out of those conditions wiioojping- at theEepublicaii League.
The clergymen of the city, deriving their k]iowledge from contact with the sin
and sorrow that flow from the partnership between government and vice, spoke .their
minds freely and pleaded with tlieircongTegations to end tlie earn
for a change. Then Mr. Enef hired a hall in which to make faces at the clergy. The
newspapers, compelled by their^ duty to the community, publislied -what is known of
the graft and crime indulged in or winked at by the municipal administration, and
suggested what is still siiccessfullyjiidden, to be known only when the peopled verturn
the municipal chip and disclose tli e bugs and worms that are under it. w
Then Mr.-Ruef grew red in the face, his choler rose and he poured himself upon
the newspapers: AVlien the administration is kicked, Mr. Kuef rubs Pond's extract on
himself and says things. When criminals are sent to the penitentiary for stuffing
the ballot-box, Mr. Ruef indulges in sad reflections upon the luiscaiTiage of justice.
When a citizen denounces gmft. Mr. Ruef says he is being personally abused. Stick a
pin in the Board of Wo^ks and Mr. Ruef bleeds.
Take a whack at the Election Commissioners and a bruise turns blue on Mr.
Ruef's reputation. Speak of the sinks of vice that pay a-price for immunity, and Mr.
Ruef advances to the footlights to^^ declare he^^ does not _-.use : tobaccos that the taste of
beer is a flavor unknoA\Ti to his castigated palate, and that he goes home every night and
stays there "till daylight does appear."
So, by circumstantial evidence it is proved that we have a government of Ruef, by
Ruef and for Ruef. Poor Mr. Sclimitz is out nights getting a frog in his throat, plead
ing with the people to re-elect Mr. Ruef as the 'Commissioner of Commissions and the
Board of Boards^ Jo rim San Francisco, for a consideration.- *
Every predatory politician Who works the workingman for a graft is making the
welkin ring in the train of the Mayor, joining him in the declaration that the election
of 31r. Partridge will destroy the labor unions. They have no such fear. They express
it*iu order to excite prejudice arid passion. The union that will be destroyed by the
election oi Mr. Partridge is the union between Schmitz and Ruef. That is a peculiar
union. To it the city is a big nursing bottle, Schmitz is the rubber pap and Ruef is
the sucker.
The bottle is getting empty, the rubber pap is not igetting any fatter, but the
sucker is bloating with blubber. Naturally he kicks and squeals as weaning time
approaches. The laboring men of the city are not getting any of the milk. They help
furnish it. Instead of making them fat it swells Mr. Ruef, and he walks around with
their meat on his bones, declaring that they will be fatally injured if permitted. to
carry their own meat on their oavii bones. v \
One of the humors of the campaign is that the rubber pap on Ruef s municipal
nursing bottle is calling on the people who furnish the milk to vindicate him! He
does not. need vindication. He needs a rest. # Being chewed by such a vigorous infant as
3lr. Kuef trying to deserve a vacation instead of a vindication.
The Mayor has a few more opi)ortunities to get laryngitis in the night . air. Will
he use them to explain what^possible interest the laboring men of San Francisco have
in Mr. Iliief that they should vote to continue him in power? It is better for the Mayor
to do this than for Mr. Ruef , for when Ruef presents himself as one of the necessaries of
life in San Francisco, and Imgins to praise himself and abuse other people, he employs
the Barbary Coast, vocabulary aiid ladies leave the room, blushing- and indignant. The
Mayor ha.s a vocabulary acquired while in the orchestra of the (ioluinbia Theater from
the actors on the stage. It may be stilted but it is not off color} and ladies do, not flee
from it in a*panic of offended modesty. :

WOMAN ANI> HUMOR.'
A party of men," among whom was
Colonel William Jennings Bryan, were
one night waiting for a train in a depot
hotel in -a small Missouri town. The
landlady was the only woman â¢ present.
The talk turning upon the alleged in
ability of women to see the point of a
joke as readily as do the' men, Mr.
Bryan took the ground that a sense of
humor was as^much a part of the femi
nine make-upa s it was that of man,
but that it merely lacked opportunity
for development.
; "To illustrate," said he, "take the
story of a party of excursionists in the
Aegean Sea. When approachingv the.
Grecian'Â» coast the â¢ party assembled
about the rails to enjoy, the beautiful
scenery.. One lady: turned inquiringly
to a gentleman at her right and said: '
" \W N hat is that white off there on the
horizon?' ;
; "IThat is the snow pn the. mountains,"
replied , the gentleman addressed.
. " 'Well, that's funny,' she replied.
'My husband said it was grease.' "
All -of the men in the group laughed
noisily at Mr. i Bryan's story, but the
landlady looked puzzled. . Finally she
said: - ' ! . . ."
, ;> "But, Mr. Bryan, how did the grease
get on the mountain?" '
: 'Mr. ; . Bryan at; once dropped the de
fense 'of / women as born humorists.- â

A. J. Waterhouse.
.* TO THE CZAR.
Now is the time. Czar Nicholas;, now
is the time, if you please,*
For. tfte sword of might and the will
to smite, and the strength ; that
is born of these; .* "*" *
Now is the time when the cruel blood
' of a Petef must fliish your veins,
For that which the force of the brute
hath 'won still naught but its
force .maintains.
You must follow now, though your soul
may shrink, where the foul,
great Catherine led.
For ha who is heir to a hall of crime
1 must see" that its walls are red.
And Moscow cries to Odessa,
And Warsaw mutters to Kieff:
"There is no space to bury our dead.
. We can spare no time to grief";
And Tiflis calls to her comrades.
While a hundred towns reply:
"When Liberty asks for victims
"Tis a r^gal thing to die."
Ah! Czar of the widespread Russias,
: \u25a0' let your timorous spirit note
That he who would throttre the people
must keep his hand at â¢ their
. â¢ throat. \u25a0 . "."â¢ l-
Scant is the time, Czar Nicholas, man's
pfty to give to you.
Though we know right well that your*
soul must dwell in' the valley of
shade and rue.
If your kindly heart be broken, there
are others that break to-day;
You are heir in time to your forebears'
crime, and the price of their guilt
-you pay.
There is never an hour for pity, there
is. never a moment for ruth;
Your ancestors bred the tiger, and
sharp is the tiger's tooth..
Ay, red is your fair Odessla,
And crimson your Moscow town,
And the people murmur, "The blood
we shed
Shall surely the tyrant drown."
From the Black Sea to the Baltic
The ground with their dead they
strew.
"Liberty beckons," the people cry,
"And this is" the time to do." -
Ah, Nicholas, Weak but; kindly, th.c
people might you forgive
Had they heard not Liberty's whisper,
"Rise in your might, and live."
"I told the people," said the profession
al office-seeker, "to investigate my record
and I said, further, that I relied upon it
for my indorsement. Now, I hope there
will be, plenty, of foggy and rainy yeather
between now and election day." â¢
"What makes you wish that?"
"Why, so that almost everybody would
catch a cold."
" "I don't see how a general cold would
advance your cause any."
"Don't, hey! Well, wouldn't it Interfere
with the normal exercise of people's ol
factory nerves, so that they wouldn't be
able to smell the record?"
OLD MAIf AND HIS | GItAXDSOX.
An old man/who had been cruelly treat
ed by his grandson, was about to pass
from earth, but before doing so he sum
moned the grandson to his bedside.
"You have treated me unkindly," the
old man said, "and I might curse you
with my dying breath, but I will do noth
ing of the kind. On the contrary, I have
left you as sole heir to all I possess.".
"Of what does it consist, grandfather?"
the young man eagerly inquired.
"Not of gold, or silver, or lands," was
the broken response, "butâ well, you
know that suit I began against Bings
when I was a young manâ l have left you
that' and you will have to consult the
lawyers." . v- \u25a0_â¢â¢â¢
Then, while the youth moaned bitter
ly., a glad and tranquil smile shone upon
the countenance of the old man as he
passed away.
For his experience with the law caused
him to realize that at last he was even
with his grandson.
SONG OF THE AUTOMOBUJS.
Hear the song of the automobile,
Of the chug-chug car of the whirling
wheel,
As it merrily goes on its whoop-la way.
With never. a mortal to bid it stay:
I blithely chug upon my way
Through sylvan brake and dingle.
Sometimes I hit a kiyi pup:
Anon with hens I mingle. \u25a0
The farmers hold their running steeds \u25a0
â¢That land them inthe ditches,
' But none the less I chug right on,
Nor mind these little hitches.
Eftsocn I strike the busy town
Where "cops" run out to bind me;
I do not mind their heated words
As they are left behind me.
Anon I strike the picnic crowd
That sought the sylvan shadows,
I leave some Clutching at the moon.
And some spread o'er the meadows.
Ah. men may run and women fly,
The hand is at my lÂ«rer;
And cats may yowl and dogs kiyi,
; But I chug on forever.
This is the song of the automobile.
Of the chug-chug car of the whirling
. wheel; .
And the, people who waflk had better "lay
low â " _ .
That is. if it's run .by a fool, you know.

LOXE FIELD PIECE
; . IS NOT ADEQUATE
Some Observations on Mili
tary Etiquette ATe Made
by the Gallant Young
Commander of Department
Your Uncle Samuel needs a new sa
lutlnff outfit at Alcatraz.
Such- is the conclusion of military
men at department headquarters. No
Ipss * personage than Brigadier Gen
eral Frederick Funston. commanding
the Department of California, confirms
this view of the situation.
Of course. General Funston. in his
official capacity, does not criticize the
subordinate officers who have charge
of the Important duty of replying to
the salutes to the American flag from
visiting warships of foreign nations.
In fact, the commanding general
says he is satisfied investigation would
tiisclose that, if there has been neglect
In this branch of military activity at
Alcatrar, he would have heard of it
long agro. But whether or no the bald
fact remains that the United States
army has not properly equipped the
post with a saluting battery.
One. lonesome gun, standing in state
ly solitude on a bluff of the rock far
from the post headquarters, is the
\u2666 quipment â¢ with \u25a0 which the United
States Government returns the cour
tesies of salutes from visiting war ves
sels. It goes without saying that this
solitary cannon is inadequate to meet
the demand Imposed upon it by army
regulations. These require that the
return salute, to the American flag
shall boom forth promptly and, fur
thermore, that, the twenty-one guns
shall be fired at five-second intervals,
r^ow any civilian,. let alone one of the
t-allant boys in blue, knows that five
eecond .intervals cannot be met with a
solitary cannon, no matter how agile
the powder monkey might be.
MORE CAWO.V XEEDEO.
So must be repeated with painful
emphasis- the glaring truth that Alca
traz must be supplied with more salut
ing guns I* the courtesies to our for
eign callers are to be shown in true
military fashion.
At â¢ department ' headquarters yester
day The Call's exclusive account of the
recent departure from regulations in
the failure to return promptly the sa
lutes-.of the homeward bound Russian
cruiser Lena, the arriving Italian war
&ft.ip Calabria and the German cruiser
Fiilke- provoked interesting discussion.
General Funston, most courteous and
affable, was disinclined to consider the
lapses as-- serious, because, as he ex
plained, representatives of the various
vessel's Governments would have sent
to tb-e department post haste for ex
planations had the slight been too
mark-ed, for there is nothing in the re
lations between Governments that re
\u2666luires'such- close attention as the ob
servance of official courtesies.

sten said:

MILK SAMPLES
CONTAIN GERMS
Several Dealers Insist on
Selling Commodity That Is
Far Below the Standard
GELATIN IN THE CREAM
Health. Officials Discover
New Foreign Substance
to Thicken Lacteal Fluid
City Chemist Gibbs and Bacteriologist
Canney yesterday filed with , the Health
Board their report of the analysis of ,124
samples of milk. The report demon
strates that while 'a great improvement
Is noted in the quality of the milk as the
result of the Health Board haying been
forced to action through the exposure of
the use of formaldehyde, yet some dairies
continue to sell milk that Is below the
standard and that contains pus and dis
ease germs of various kinds. Thirteen
samples analyzed disclosed the presence
of either germs or pus, or both, and four
were below the butter fat standard, one
being 2.3, a second 2.1 and a third 3.1 per
cent. A sample of milk from the Jersey
Farm Dairy submitted by Dr. Edgar Bry
ant showed the percentage of butter fat
to be as low as Lti. or just half what it
ought to be at this season of the year.
If Dr. Bryant will swear out a warrant
for the arrest of the proprietor of the
dairy, the Health Board will aid in the
latter's prosecution. Warrants may also
be sworn out for P. Menjou, whose milk
showed 3.1 per cent butter fat, L. dl Santi
2.1, and L. Span! 2.3.
A sample of milk from the New York
Dairy, the proprietor of which, George
Smart, was recently fined $200 for having
formaldehyde in his milk, which caused
illness in the Lent household, showed the
presence of detritus only, and butter fat
to the extent of 4 per cent, or 8-10 above
the standard, showing that his milk is
improving. Most of the samples analyzed
contained detritus, the polite chemical
name for dirt.
Three samples of cream from J. Sartori,
Davis & Co. and the Standard Milk Com
pany contained gelatin, which Is evidently
used to thicken the cream and is harm
less", but the law prohibits any foreign
substance to be mixed with milk. The
samples which contained germs or were
deficient in butter fat follow:
Marin County Dairy, staphyloeocci and pus;
S. J. Hopkins, Burlingame Milk Company, J.
Connelly, Marin County Dairy, Berkeley Farm,
Redwood Farm, Bay City Ranch, Mlllbrae

CUSTOMS OFFICES REMOVING
FROM THE OLD BUILDIXG
Wrecking of Ancient Ruin Will Be Fin
ished by Â»w Year's Day b y
'..â¢./. I ...Astute Contractors.
Customs Collector Stratton was notified yes
terday that the bond of Luhman & Connelly,
contractors, for \u25a0wrecking the old Custom-house,
had been approved by the Secretary of the
Treasury. The work of removing the offices
of the Custom-house- to the Appraiser's build
ing waÂ» begun yesterday and the new quar
ters will be fully occupied by Monday. The
wreckers will then begin the work of tearing
down the old building. The contract price
for the work Is $12,500 and the contractors
take all the material, ot which there is much
good granite, iron, brick and marble in the
building.
AH the cast-off carpets and furniture of the
Custom-house and Postofflce building will be
sold by .public auction on November 8 in front
of the building:. The site must be cleared
by December 31. \u25a0
Thomas Butler, the contractor .for. the erec
tion of the new Custom-house, has furnished a
bond to the Government of $1,194,000 for the
faithful performance of the contract. | The
bond has been approved.'
bria's officers were, therefore, not at fault.
So far as Alcatraz Is concerned, there is
only one gun there for saluting purposes. This
gun is stationed on the south side of the
island, so. that it can be heard. It is quite
a distance from the post headquarters. 1 have
no knowledge that there has been any lack
of proper reply to salutes, and I am of the
opinion that perhaps, if there has been any
failure there, it is due to misunderstandings.
Such a misunderstanding- as made In the Urn
bria's case.
SALUTES XOT GOLFING.
You must remember that saluting is done,
not. according to the rules that obtain in a
golf or a tennis club, but by the most rigid
of military regulations. \u25a0
When a foreign warship arrives at this port
It is "the duty of the commanding officer at
Alcatraz. the official saluting point, to board
the chip at once and to offer the courtesies of
the department and the official compliments to
the commander. That accomplished, the United
States representative leaves and repairs U> his
headquarters. Then the foreign vessel salutes
the flag. The reply should be prompt and ac
cording to regulations. Under the regulations
it Is the duty of the fort at Alcatraz to return
all salutes. I No salutes to the flag are ex
changed under regulations between foreign
vessels- and. land forts oftener than' once a
year, an exception being made In the case of
rh'.T-f carrying an admiral's flag.
Â£o far as the Lena, the Calabria and the
FaJke are concerned I have no official Informa
tion that the ealutec wÂ«re not properly given.
In the case of the German cruiser Falke, if a
salute were fired, whether tardy or not, ehÂ«
was not entitled to it. for the vessel had been
In this port only a few months before and had
then given and had received the salute.

DENVER, Nov. 2.â Mrs. I. T. Monihan
is suing for a divorce here ; from AJ I J.
Monihan, whom she married at Red Bluff,
Cal., despite the protests of; relatives
and friends. She claims' that her par
ents are wealthy, that she was left $15,000
worth of diamonds by ia. relative who died
last fall and that -her husband; has . dis
sfpated her fortune. The couple were
married on January 4 of \ this year | and
her husband | told her j he ; was ; a lawyer
and Denver, was the place for, money.
She supplied the money and they came
here. Upon the very: day : of their arrival
he returned to her : room under the
fluence of lid.uor, says the complaint,' and
Informed her that he married her, for her
money, and that as soon as he obtained
it he would leave her. 1 ; She was among
strangers ; and thought by kindness she
would be able to make a man of him. ,
â¢ On January 15 he took her diamond pin
and pawned ' it ; in a 'gambling house, she
says. .On January 19 he took: a large
number of her diamonds and jewelry and
secured/ $580 on v them* from a pawn
broker. Later, she says,; he Â«tole all of
her diamonds and; jewelry he could get
his hands on and squandered the money.
The complaint sets forth that he: beat
her over the head and in the 'face until
she had to wear a double veil. whenever
she appeared in public. .
Local attorneys state Monihan's career
as a lawyer In Denver was brief. He in
troduced himself as a \u25a0 lawyer, but spent
his time in the saloons and gambling
houses until his. wire's money | was all
gone. Mrs. Monihan asks that her hus
band be compelled to pay her $300 : a
month alimony, $150 attorney's fee and all
costs. ' / )

Experience at Cape Horn

Port Do Her Skipper and
Crew Feel They Are Safe s
The French bark Duchesse de Berry, 200
days from Swansea, arrived in port short
ly/ after , 10 : o'clock last night. . The De
Berry; .encountered i all kinds Yof | rough
weather while rounding the Horn and lost
a * set of her "\u25a0\u25a0 sails during . one siege of
tempestuous weather in the southern seas.
She wag quoted at 20 per cent on the over
due.list.. , :
', t Captain 'Kermoal, her commander," tells
a thrilling story of the. battle with the
elements while the good ship was round
ing the Cape. $ She tossed about { on the
billows, her crew expecting every moment
that she would 'be lashed to pieces or
driven on some treacherous rock. '
.; Luck favored the vessel, however, and
she managed to weather,, the terrible
storm;; tjiouehiher.! erew v were all worn
out and exhausted from their efforts to
.keep^her afloat. 'The weather still con
tinued bad,* and not until' the bark was
within, a few days of this port did her
skipper : and crew think their lives were
safe. "\u25a0:':â¢'-;" \u25a0:':â¢' -; -;'- \u25a0-\u25a0:\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0,;." - : \u25a0. ; ...
The Duchesse de Berry is loaded with
3100 tons of coal, /consigned to Girvin &
Eyre of this city. She presented a woe
begone appearance last night, her patched
up rigging and generally dilapidated look
telling only too plainly the hardships she
suffered while rounding the Horn,- as the
sea was washins over her. '
Bellboy's Plans Miscarry.
. John Shepherd, a bellboy at the St. Augusta
Hotel, 538 Geary street, is at the City Prison
and .will probably be booked on two "charges
of burglary. . He had charge of the keys of
the rooms on Tuesday night, and it is alleged
he entered the rooms of Joseph Kelly and Jo
seph Scott, stealing from the former a dia
mond brooch and - from the latter a diamond
stickpin and ?5 in coin. Detective Wren ar
rested Shepherd, but has not yet recovered
the stolen Jewelry. Shepherd had arranged to
leave for Los Angeles on Wednesday morning,
thinking that the Jewelry would not be missed
till after he had: gone.
Death Results From. Fall.
The body o f Alfred , Theall, a bookkeeper,
residing at 4030 Twentieth street, was brought
to the City Morgue yesterday afternoon, and
investigation proved that Theall ' had fallen on
Hartford street ' and "fractured his skull. It
appears that the man had been drinking, and
that, while on his way home, he stumbled on
a rock, f- He was found by a driver of a veg
etable wagon and taken to his home, where
death occurred. . â¢
. a Pang-Yanger?
Â«T A Pan? Yangcr Is a
native of Pang Yang, a
primitive village of tanners in
the Catskills. Abijah Bead is
the Pang- Yanger, a man with
a strange sense of justice and
revenge, who punishes \ his
faithless wife by bringing her
son; to grow tip in the com-
. munity, where she is best
known that his startling re-
semblance will be a punish-
ment to her. His purpose is
overwhelmed and set aside by
the irresistible impulse of his
love for a Southern girl who ,
comes to live in the mountain
village near Pang Yang, and
whose love for him sweeps
over his great nature like the
forest fire which .wiped -Pang .
p Yang but of existence. The
Pang- Yanger's comments on
men and things are a part of
the entertainment of the book. ,
This is the kind of a story
which, when you are once in
the heart of it, you finish
recklessly without laying it

CALIFORNIA BALL TOSSERS IN DEMAND
MAJOR LEAGUE MAGNATES
STILL AFTER NEALON.
Uncle's First Baseman
Likely to Become
a rirate.
Chicago Joins in Chase
and Will Try to
Land Prize.
i
The services of Joe Nealon are more in
demand now than ever. It begins to
look as though the big first baseman of
the San Francisco team can name his
own terms with the magnates of the big
leagues. Ted Sullivan came all the way
out from Cincinnati to sign Joe up. but
so far he has not been able to land the
prize.
Fred Clarke, manager of the Pittsburg
Pirates, is still camping on the trail of
the youngster. He says he is going to
land him at all costs and he \u25a0 probably I
I will. He has offered Joe more money
I than any of the others and inasmuch as
I Pittsburg is a much faster team than !
Cincinnati, it is likely Joe will make up
his mind to go there, for he will have
a chance to shine in the city of smoke.
A new bidder loomed up last night in I
the person of Charles \V. Murphy, presi- ]
dent of the Chicago National League
team. Murphy gave out a statement in
Chicago last night to the" effect that if
Nealon decides to become a big leaguer
he will wear a' Chicago National uniform
beyond a doubt. Murphy evidently fig
ures on getting the youngster somehow,
though he will have to go some in order
to beat Clarke and Sullivan.
Nealon in the meantime is holdhig off
and does not want toÂ»sign till he is good
and ready. He Bees they are hot. after
him and that he will be worth something.
If the present pace keeps up Joe will cer
tainly draw a salary of about $6000 in the
big league. Clarke has already offered
him $5000 and he, : will not let a paltry
thousand stand in the way of landing the
prize.
Nealon would probably have signed
"with the Pittsburg magnate in the first
place had he not received a telegram
from President Garry Herrmann of Cm- :
cinnati. requesting him not to sign with :
â¢any team till his agent, Ted Sullivan, ar
rived on thÂ« scene to talk business. Nea
lon promised he would not and. for that
reason he is still a free lanca.
Papa Nealon has already given Joe his
consent to sign with any team he pleases.
Nealon Sr. naturally wants Joe to get
in with. a fast club and at the same time
get as much money as he. possibly can.
He, too. favors the Cincinnati offer,
though he wants Joe to suit himself be
fore he signs the contract. It is likely
Joe will make up his mind to-day where
he will play next season.
There will be an unusual number of
California players on Eastern diamonds
when the ball is put into play next year.
REGISTRATION" CARD GIVEN*
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE
Pacific Athletic Association Recognize**
John Garibaldi of Polytechnic
School nn an Amateur.
The Pacific Athletic Association at a meeting
last night granted a registration card. to. John
Garibaldi, a member of the athletic team of
the Polytechnic High School by a vote of 6
to 4. .
Several days ago the Academic Athletic
League suspended Gapibaldi for a year for
participating in a game of baseball in Marti
nez, in which, it is claimed, professionals
played on the opposing team. The action of
the league officials caused considerable feeling
among the pupils of the school and their par
ents, and the matter was taken before the
Pacific Athletic Association. Testimony was
taken on both sides. Garibaldi' testified that
J. G. Boobar. who is connected with the Cogs
well College, and who is also a member of the
Academic Athletic League and actively worked
to keep him out of the game, offered him
(Garibaldi) ?2rt if he would leave, the Poly
technic High School an register at Coggwell'a.
As the acticn of the Academic League came
after the Polytechnic High School had de
feated Eevera] of the other high schools and
' was In line to compete for the football cham
pionship. th> games won were forfeited, and it
put that school out of the running. .
The members of the Academic League
claimed the Pacific Athletic Association had no
authority to rescind their decision, and credit
the Polytechnic team with the games and al
low them to take part for the championship.
The entire matter will be submitted to the
Amateur Athletic Union, ; which body is su
preme in amateur sport? in America. Its de
cision will settle the casa.

It's getting to be an old story, thÂ«
way the Tigers make codfishes out of
the Seals ' at Recreation Park. They
seem to be able to \u25a0 do It right along
without letting out any extra steam.
The whole team contributed to the
downfall of Uncle Hank yesterday, but
Keefe was the man behind the Indian
sign. The ones he twisted over the
pan were the real bewildering offer-
Ings, and the best the Seals could get
was three hits. ' -
For a tail end team the Tigers are
playing ball that is branded with a big
league stamp. â¢ They can get a man
over on a' hit cleverly, and when, they
are forced to do it they send 'em
through without the aid of safe drives.
For five innings yesterday Hitt was
as good a man as Keefe, and the team
was working right behind him. The
only thing he lacked was control, and
that finally got him. In the sixth he
passed Eagan and McLaughlin. Lynch
then laid down a bunt. Nealon tried
to head off Truck -at third, but was
late, so Hitt faced a full house with
not one down. He managed to throw
Eagan out at the plate on Casey.' s
grounder, but Graham got . away â¢ with
the squeeze play and sent McLaughlin.
through. \u25a0 â¢
It v seemed that one run would be
about all, but the eighth brought more
disaster for the Seals. Lynch opened
it with a hit and Casey sacrificed.
Graham advanced him on an out and
Shea let him in by failing to hold the
next ball pitched. Keefe walked and
Shea made another passed ball. Then
Sheehan and Doyle clouted the leather
for safe drives and the score was 4
to 0. .. . ./
Nealon and Householder were the
only Seals who were able to tap Keefe
for safeties. The ~ former was there
with one, while the latter grabbed two,
the last of which was a three-bagger
to the far corner of center field in the
seventh. There ; were two men down
at the time and Irwin could not come
through. This was the nearest the
Seals could, get in the direction of the
,rubber. The score:

OAKS TRY THREE PITCHERS.
Iberp, Hocan and Smith Unable to
Stop Seattle Men.
I Oakland went to pieces at the outset of the
game with Seattle at Idora Park yesterday and
finally settled - down to a try-out of young
Smith, -the busher pitcher* they: have, had on
their staff for a few : weeks. Smith made
good, and .if - he . has the strength, to hold out
he may perform well for . the . Commuters. â¢
The story, sad from â¢an Oakland . point of
view, was all told in the first inning. Ham
Iburg went to - pieces at the outset. The Si
washes landed on him - for four hits. He sent
In : two wild pitches, which \u25a0 landed - four - runs
over the \u25a0 plate.' Hogan \u25a0 was \u25a0 then put in to
pitch tha rest of the Inning, and from him
the northern team gathered one more hit and
one more run. In the second . Inning Hogan
fell \u25a0 before the . bats â¢of the northerners, and
with three â¢ hits . and a \u25a0 bunch of errors two
more runs came oyerthe plate. .. -\u25a0..â¢\u25a0'
, -All ' was off :as ' far as . winning : was con
cerned and , young Smith was put . in to be
slaughtered or hold up his end if he was able.
The - youngster did well and held the team
that - had - batted - two : experienced pitchers out
of ~ the box . down Â£to \u25a0 five - scattered hits. In
only one . Inning - did : they - duplicate hits on
him. - That > duplication, .with the aid of an
error,', resulted Tn . a run. - \u25a0 . -.
-" . Mosklman drove in . two of Oakland'! runs.'

ENSIGN WADE'S
TRIAL CLOSED
Accused Officer Takes the
Stand and Tells Court All
He Knows About Accident
SUMMING UP IS -BRIEF
Prosecutor Declares Defend
ant Should Be Convicted
Because He Left Station
Special Dispatch to Tbd Call.
VALLEJO, Nov. 2. â The court-mar
tial of Ensign Charles T. Wade of the
Bennington ended at Mare Island thts
afternoon. Wade went, on the stand
this morning in his, own defense. He
tokl his story without hesitation and
in an impressive manner. It is as fol
lows: I /\u25a0.,\u25a0;
When I-waÂ« assigned to the ship Com
mander . Mica was in command. That officer
called me to his cabin and told mo that the
discipline In the engine room was excellent
and that it was not advisable to make any
iadlcai changes. I went over the engine room
and inspected it thoroughly. I found boiler A
in a bad condition. B, which exploded, was in
better condition than any of the other boiler*.
For- the first month after my assignment I
went around the engine room constantly and
until the chief machinist told me that it was
not necessary for me to spend so much time In
inspections, as the men of that station were
required to perform a certain routine and 1 that
it was the chief machinist's duty to see that
they did.
Every time the Bennington reached a navy
yard I asked for 'authority to have the hand
raising gear repaired, but never received thÂ«
desired permission. The Bennington was at
Mara Island but six working days last May.
and to have repaired her properly at that time'
would have required twenty-Jive working days.
When the Bennington was at Bremerton the
; crown shfetg had to be Jacked up. and shortly
afterward at Valparaiso. Chile, all the crown
sheets had to be raised three Inches each.
When the ship was at Honolulu In June last
I reported all of the boilers In a bad condi
tion and repairs were ordered when the ship
reached San Diego. On the morning of the
explosion the safety valves were blown off ana
found to be in good condition.
Wade explained his absence from
the engine-room by stating that he had
inspected the boilers casually at Â»
a.'m. on the morning of the explosion,
and that a few minutes previous to the
explosion he had gone up on Heck to
watch for the return of Captain Young
from the shore in order to send word
down below to have the fires fresh
ened up as soon as he sighted the
ship's gig. Continuing, he said:
I told Chief Machinist Ferguson to go eaiy
with boilers A and B, as they would not be
required until aftÂ«r the vessel got out to â¢\u25a0*?..
On the morning of the explosion Hunt, thÂ«
water tender whose eyes were so bad that ha
could not read the eteam gauge, cam* to my
cabin and asked to be relieved.
Commander George Ransome of the
steam engineering department of the
Mare Island navy yard was a strong
witness for Wade. He said that his
examination of the safety valves
showed that the valves. should have
blown off at 150 pounds.. Ransome
said that it is not the duty of the en
gineering officer to be In the engine
room all the time.
Attorney Bell for the defense in the
summing up of the evidence said that
not a bit of testimony on which Wade
could be convicted had been intro
duced. West In summing up for the
department was even briefer than Bell.
He declared that Wade should be con
victed, as he should nave stayed in the
engine-room after assigning an oiler
to dut as a water 'tender.

' Quilla Wallace, who for two years
has been a citizen of Macon, Ga., began
migrating last week, following his usu
al custom as to route. He completed
the housekeeping arrangement and in
the morning, bright and early, hitched
up and drove. out into the street. N There
he poised his cane. Then he let" go.- The
cane fell to the West.
"It's Kansas, mother," he said to his
wife.' '. -'.. / -V. ;\u25a0â¢ -;s>- ;
The route was thus fixed and the two
comfortable wagons started on | their
journey. The town and the character
of business he will follow are open
questions with Mr./ Wallace. His usual
plan is to "look^ around" until he
strikes a place that suits all members
and then locate until it is time to move
again. **-â¢
The Wallace family started on. its
first pilgrimage In the spring of 1564,
when they left 'Macon. Since then they
have journeyed north, east, south and
west, renewing Its residence sixty-six
times. The boys of the family liked
the. roving life until they grew up,
when they settled down and went into
business.
But Mr. Wallace had the moving
spirit and a year was a long time for
him to stay in one place. His wife does
not object, because she recovered her
health by camping and. moving. In her
early married life she was subject to
spells' of headache, 7a malady that was
removed by three years of camp life. \u25a0
Mr. Wallace, who is now 66 years
old, says this is the last pilgrimage he
and his wife will make. Only he and
his wife and his granddaughter, Ollie,
12 years old, are in tne party this time.
They carry provisions, bedding and
every comfort for camp life.
' Husband and. wife have spent more
than half their wedded life in moving
about and are more at home on the
road than in the narrow limits of. the
conventional dwelling. They are in
comfortable circumstances financially
and if they do not find what they want
in the jayhawker State they will keep
moving.â Chicago Chronicle.
\o Thoroughfare to Science.
Luther Burbank, the vegetable wizard
of California, who, setting j aside a well
known version of Scripture, has Induced
nature to reproduce according to his will,
instead of each 'species after its own'
kind, is announced as a convert of the
new doctrine; of eugenlos. This doctrine
âby the way, a very old one dressed in a
new nameâ relates to the bettering of the
human species by more careful, breeding
and child culture. Mr. Burbank speaks of
children as "the most precious and pliable
product of the ages," and says that what !
"tne scientific breeder is called upon to do
is to inaugurate a system of selective
weeding." The spirit of old Lycurgus, if it
keeps in touch with affairs, must Invisi
bly applaud the vindication in the name
of modern science given to the principle
of the "weeding" out methods, which he
introduced on the Spartan hillsides.
But it may be'ydoubted whether "Mr.
Burbank will be as successful in eugenics
as in plant transformation. It may be
true that better bodies maybe secured for
the remainder by removing the deficient.
It may also be true that brain .lobes can
be developed as the cattle breeders have
developed loins in the short-horn cattle.
But if there is to be weeding it will al
ways be some one else's darling, not our
own, which must feel the scythe of the
aberuncator. Like Artemus Ward, who
was willing that his wife's -relatives
should be sent to the war, we would con
fine the scheme to other people's chil
dren. For our own we propose to pre
serve with small regard to the, effect of
the species. Moreover, for such is:one of
the most abiding mysteries, the more they
are crooked and lack, the more we cher
ish. . Survival of the fittest may be the
ruthless law of nature, but human nature'
seeks to repeal It; moved by an instinct
which is in the very fiber>of being, it
seeks to secure the survival of the un
fittest.âNew York Globe. S
Millionaire Palace*.
The palace of the/ millionaire, like the
p;ast Side tenements. or the suburban cot
tages, have been built . directly for the
market. The modern T*;ifth' avenue man
sion has become almost - a staple article
of merchandise.' Five or six years ago the
builder who risked his capital in, a, $20,000
or $40,000 house was , regarded -as a ,very
venturesome person. In the last six years,
however, a single New York builder has
erected houses at a cost of from $400,000 to
$500,000 on a purely speculative" basis, and
has,, moreover, \ sold them. Whether ; the
purchasers' contentment with; the ready
made article, \ however, is owing to /the
lack of Ideas or an indecent haste to es
tablish themselves on America's greatest
residential thoroughfare is not deter
mined.âMetropolitan Magazine. ; \

NATION URGED
TO GIVE THANKS
President Issues Proclama
tion Naming Thursday,
, Nov. 30, as a Day of Prayer 1
COUNTRY- IS AT PEACE
Its Only; Foes, He -Says,
Are Those That Spring
â¢ â¢ jh'om Passions and Follies
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. â The Presi-r
dent . to-day issued ; his proclamation
naming- Thursday, November 30 next,
as,a day for thankecriving. The procla
mation follows:
By the President of ' the United States of
*Amerlca, 1 a Proclamation â When, nearly ! three
centuries arco. the first ' settlers \u25a0 came to the
country which has now become this streat re
public, they faced not only hardships and
privation, but terrible risk to their lives/ In
those Krim years the custom grew of setting
apart one day in each yearj for a special
sen-ice of thankseivins to the Almlrtty for
preserving the people through the changing
seasons. * The '-custom has now become na
tional and ' hallowed by Immemorial usage. "We
live in easier and more plentiful times . than
our forefathers, the men who with rugsed
streneth faced the rugged days; and yet the
dangers \u25a0 to national life are quite as great
now as at any previous time In our history.
\u25a0 It la eminently fitting that once a year our
people should Bet apart a day for praise and
thanksgiving to : the Giver of good, and, at
the same time that they. express their thanks
fulness for the abundant mercies received,
should manfully acknowledge their shortcom
ings and pledge themselves solemnly and In
good faith to strive to overcome them.
During the past year we have been blest
with bountiful crops. Our business prosperity
has been great. No other people has ever
stood on as high a level of material well
being as ours now stands. We are not threat
ened-by foes from without. The foes from
whom we should pray to be delivered are our
passions, .appetites and follies; and against
these there is always need that we should
Therefore, I now set apart Thursday, the 30th
day of - this November, as, a day of tnanks
jrlvinz for the past and of prayer for the
future, and on that day I ask that through
out the nation the people gather -In their
homes and places of worship and In render-
Ins: thanks unto the Most High for the mani
fold blessings of the past year consecrate
themselves to a life of cleanliness, honor and
wisdom, so that this nation may do it* al
lotted work on the earth in a manner wortny
of thoae who founded It and those who pre-
Se in e iiinew whereof I have hereunto set my
hand and caused the seal of the Lnlted States
o Don(fat the city of Washington, this second
day of November In the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and five and of the
independence of the United. States the one
hundred and thirtieth.

' The advance in sterling cables to within 15
pcintÂ» of what is usually considered the point
At which. It i 9 profitable to export gold was
an Important market factor. The Internal dis
nrdess in Russia are causing uneasiness
abroad, end both Parts and London may draw
Fold from New York next week. Leading
ba.niers expect quite a substantial export
jr.ovament. This, together with the fact that
Â«on*Â» etockt had cone Into weak hands, was
r<-sDor.?'.ble for the weakness in the late trad
ir*.
"The business situation continues to show im.
rrovnnent in the iron and steel markets,
â¢which are certainly considered the barometer
et trade. In the long run s*icb a- condition
means higher prices, but for the next few
weeks the money market will probably con
tinue the dominant Influence. Special move
rneatJi, such as In the traction shares and in
; closely held soecialties. will urobably be the
market features, but we see nothing but a
r.Â«xrow professional market in eight."

THE" COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON. Nov. 2.â The story about Boston
Consolidated Is' that the American Smelting
people are buying control In the open mar
ket. They are said to have taken all the
stock of a pool here at about 12 and are after
more. The general copper market is without
feature except a ''little* activity In the Utah
group. Concentrated, buying of Amalgamated
rather, helped the market this . morning.

NEW YORK, Nov. 2.â Market opened
steady, onÂ« to two down. The trading- was
active around the call and there was free bid
ding for March that carried that month 'to
11.02 c. but there was a lack ot public buying
to hold it. . The foreign pÂ»litlcal outlook seems
to check bullish operations for. the time being.
Spots were strong and higher In the : South.
This is the sustaining feature or the mariet
now. Mr. PricÂ« is findinc out his bearish
ideas of the market. We are approaching the
issuance 'of the Government condition report,
which will be given out-next Wednesday noon.
There is a tremendous amount of March cot
ton for sale on a scale up from lie. Mar
ket has got to absorb' this before having tur
thcr advance. Think likely, to sell off* some
what on It first; but on any pronounced reces
sions will do to buy asaln. .

COLLINS CASE
MOVES SLOWLY
Accused Attorney Trying to
Quash or Set Aside the
Indictment for Perjury
USES BITTER AVORDS
Defendant Kefers to Mother
.of His Children in^Dis
paraging Terms in Court
<TeorpÂ« D. â¢ Collins, the attorney
charged â¢n-th bigamy and perjury, is
â¢videnfly moviiii? only the pawns In the
Â»ime of leca! chess he is playing. Yes
terday he examined all th* members of
the Andrews Grand Jury except three
on motion to fei aside or quash the
Indictment Jor perjury.
.During the session he referred to
his flret Wife, Charlotte B. Newman
\u25a0Collins, as "that new man-woman" and
the marriage as an "alleged marriage."
The array of lepal talent that has been
\u25a0with Collins formerly was not present
yesterday. He conducted his case
alone.
- Collins cqntests the indictment on
twenty-one statutory grounds. The
taost "startling: allegation Is that no
regular ballot for the Grand Jury
that indicted him was held, and that
tilt Jury was not drawn as prescribed
by law." The clerks of Judge Kerrigan's
eqyrt will tÂ»e called to-day to testify on
thjs point.
â¢Among the other allegations made In
â¢upport of the motion to Quash or to
Â»et aside the Indictment are: That the
indictment was not indorsed as pre
eoibed, that the names of the wit
nesses, examined were uot Inserted in
the indictment, that the jury was
biased, and a multitude of other techni
cal objections. ' .
All of the grand jtMors except Sulli
van, Davis and SmitiT were questioned
-by Collins. He asked each whether
ht was" present at the finding of the
Indictment lor bigamy and if at that
time they had formed an opinion as to
the "Alleged marriage with a woman
ssmtd Newman." All the jurors replied
that they were present. Each was
Questioned closfely as to the time of
lys residence in San Francisco.
The case will be taken up again to
day, when the three remaining grand
jurors and the clerk of Judge Kerri
gan's court will' be examined. It is
probable "that after they are heard the
cafe will proceed to argument on the
motion "to set aside or quash the in
diclment. Judge Lennon declares that
he will lengthen the Saturday session
$n 'Order to expedite the trial of the
case.
â¢ ; OlliYis made application at the Su
preme Court yesterday for a writ of
prohibition, restraining Superior Judge
Gsahaai from proceeding further with
the maintenance suit instituted by Mrs.
Collins No. 1. The Justices took no
'fctfbn in the matter yesterday.

CANNOT BEAR TO SEE HER
FORMER FIANCE FLIRT.
She Slaps His Face and THat
of Woman He Addresses.
Her Illogical Excuse Prompts Judge to
Argue, but He Reconsiders.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
For a while after the severance of
their tender relationship both Charles
Harrington of 863 Market street and
Mi?s Maggie Holland, address not dis
closed, went their respective ways and
ostensibly ench was willing that the
other should form new attachments
with members of the opposite sex. In
deed, on more than one occasion
Charles bestowed encouraging smiles
upon Maggie when he happened to meet
her walking or talking to a man, and
he reasonably assumed that she would
retaliate in kind if she would perchance
catch him in the act. of escorting or
conversing with a woman. But then
he did not understand the nature of
the feminine, human being as well as
he did later on.
While chatting with a lady on the
street one day he was both pained and
surprised to see Maggie approach him
with truculent mien. Instead of the
approving smile he expected her to
wear her face was expressive of fury
held in chock, and while he gazed at
her in astonishment she smartly
slapped his face with one of her hands,
while she aimed a blow at the coun
tenance of his companion with the
other. The latter person dodged' and
fled and Mr. Harrington gallantly, fol
lowed, with intent to protect her from
further onslaught.
After several repetitions of the fore
going seene â with change of place and
personnel of his vis-a-vis â Mr. Har
rington began to weary of the thing,
such weariness probably being pro
moted by the rapidly decreasing num
ber of women who "were willing to be
seen in his company on any. public thor
oughfare, and he decided to precipitate
the climax. The opportunity came to
him on the afternoon of October 21,
when Miss Holland pounced cpon him
as he stood and swapped small talk
with a female acquaintance at Powell
and Market streets. Both his face and
that of her to whom he- was speaking
were slapped by Miss Holland, whom he
promptly gave into custody.
"What did you do it for? Police Judge
Mogan asked the defendant.
"Because me and him was once en
gaged," she replied.
"But the engagement was broken by
mutual consent and you had no exclu
sive right to his attentions after that."
"Why did he go an' tell me that that
woman was out of town, an' then me
to see him with my own two eyes
a-standing talkin' to her?"
His Honor started to say something â
perhaps to point out the lack of logic
in Miss Holland's plea â but he recon-
Eldered and then pronounced her guilty
of peace disturbance.;
"I'll allow you" to; go ; on probation un
til November 16." he-said, "and if you
perform any face-slapping a*d interim
I'll send 'you to Jail." fj
"Of all things!'". was Miss Holland's
comment. â¢ .

Louis Bray, paperhanger, was smoking
a pipe as he sauntered . along Tehama
street and attracted the attention of sev
eral matrons groused, one of whom hail
ed him with the Jocular' greeting:
"Hello, hubby!" .
"You go an' -soak yer head," was Mr.
Bray's discourteous response, uttered
without removal of the pipe from his
mouth. * ,
"I'll soak yours instead." exclaimed the
lady and she swung. her right fist against
his jaw,, displacing the pipe, which drop
ped to the sidewalk and was shattered.
When he recovered 'from the stagger
ing effect of the wallop his assailant and
her companions had /vanished and while
he was profanely challenging any or all
of them to reappear and engage him In
combat a policeman arrested him for
disturbing the peace."
"Your story, Mr. Bray," said Judge Ca
baniÃS, "justifies this court In ventilating
the time-worn opinion that you. are more
sinned against than sinning. , You may
put that opinion In' your pipsâ when you
buy a new oneâ and fcmoke it. Go home."
Charles Clapeloni, scavenger, disciplined
his better half, Marie, by, locking herein
an empty apartraent of their home, 420
Locust street, 'confining her.dietary to one
meal a day and occasionally kicking, her
with a heavily shod foot. He was arrest-:
ed on his wife's complaint about sis
months ago for battery, but Judge Mogan
yielded to the woman's implorations and
dismissed him with a reprimand. His
second arrest for, the offense took place
Wednesday, and to-day the case will be
disposed of.

Mrs. B. Frances Rose \u25a0 reluctantly told
Judge Mogan of how she was dispossess
ed of her diamond. pin by*' Slats". Davis,
baseball umpire,- whÂ».e they were r dlnlng
tete-a-tete one day- last spring, In Talt's.
The jewel was stuck in her collar and,
after expressing admiration of It, ."Slata'.'
pulled it from Its nestling place and, said
he would like to "flash" it "on certain, of
his friends. She" demurred,^ but hâ¬ said:
"Never mind, kid : it'll. be all right,". and
he kept ft ,: She-did 'not 'cause 'his arrest
on the charge of 'felony; embezzlement un
til she became weary of importuning him
to restore her. property. After his arrest
he did restore it to her and she 'did not
desire to prosecute- him,' because. he was
eager to go to l^os Angeles and, she was
booked to start * eastward Uorday.
' "Slats" informed â¢ the " court % that ' his
THE -SAN GALL, FRIDAY; 3,-1905;
prolonged retention of the pin was
partly owing to his irrepressible spirit
of fun, which was tickled by Mrs.
Rose's anxiety, and â¢' partly owing to
his professional duties, which were so
onerous "as to afford him time to think
of nothing else; But as the pin had
been returned to its owner and she
was willing to withdraw her complaint
against him, he could not understand
wiiy he was kept dangling, around that
court unless he was the victim of a
deep-laid and far-reaching conspiracy
on the part of certain ball players who
were not :fond of him because he had
fined them. No,* he never told a cer
tain newspaper, reporter that he and
Mrs. Rose had dined together at. Talt's,
and his sworn statement that he never
had so dined was whole truth. .
"Somebody in this case, is swearing
untruth," said, the Judge, "and we will
have the newspaper reporter in ques
tion subpenaedto aid us in getting at
the exact location of the perjury."
So the hearing was -continued until
to-day. As. the pin is worth only $15
the felony embezzlement charge can
hardly be made to adhere. . nor is it
absolutely certain that -Mrs. Rose can
be induced to swear to an amended
complaint alleging misdemeanor em
bezzlement,, as she evidently has for
given "Slats" and js s as anxious as he
to quash the incident that has brought
s.uch undesirable notoriety to both of
them., \u25a0- : \u25a0'. .'. '.\u25a0â¢-,. ,- â¢ . \u25a0

Andrew , Peters, coachman, was 5n
plain attire and on pleaslire bent when
he visited the Olympic Dance Hall on
Pacific street, but the majestic mien
that made him such an Imposing figure
as he' sat behind ' the- horses and
handled the ribbons could not be doffed
with his livery, and no sooner did he
enter the aforementioned temple, of
Terpsichore than the 1 nymphs therein
employed scrambled to possess him as
if he had . been an , election -card -and
they so many. small boys.. His capture
was effected by a brunette hour! with
a swivel eye, and ' despite her visual
defect he bowed in submission. She
triumphantly swung him into a two
step and leered over his ; shoulder at
her crestfallen rivals. .. *
So heartily did. Mr. Peters relish the
dance that he demurred when the floor
manager silenced the ..orchestra and
suggested that *'all promenade to the
bar." His partner, while apparently
sharing his displeasure, solaced him
"with assurance that after, they had
partaken of liquid refreshments she
would see to it that the tfo-step was
repeated and' prolonged, and thus he
was induced to accompany her to tho
beverage dispensary. She called/ for
beer, 6 cents .where there. Is -no, danc
ing, and hedldjlkewls'e. and 'when he
laid upon the"cdtlnter:a quarter-dollar
coin in payment for the drinks the
bartender .swept It into the -cash, reg
ister and rang up a "25". tablet, 'at the
same time remarking, in cheerful tone,
"That's 1 just right." < â¢ ,
It was for hurling his emptied glass,
at the barman's head that Mr. Davis
was arrested,' despite the protests of
his partner, but in evident accordance
with the desire of all :the other ladles
present. .'Judge Mogan continued the
case until this morning:. â¢
Mrs. Maggie Flores affected deafness
when Judge Cabaniss sentenced her, to
sixty days for drunkenness, and she
was indiscriminately soliciting.verifica
tion of the r sentence when . Bailiff
"Con" Dono hue grasped her arm. and

MEMORIES
OVERCOME
MRS. TALBOT
3lillionaire T s Wife Gives Way
to Tears While Testifying
in Her Maintenance Action
Before- Judge Murasky
HINTS AT SCANDAL
DROPPED IN COURT
Social Leaders Are to Be
Called to Tell of the
Causes That Havei
rupted the Litigants' Home
Overcome by the memory of yester
years when- she was happy,, her children
gathered round her on the eve of Christ
mas, the Ideals for which all women live
realized, Mrs. Annie D. Tajbot grave way
to tears while on the stand. In Judge Mu
rasky's Department of the Superior Court
yesterday. \
The memory of theie days had been re
called to her by cou/lsel that her tenderest
recollections might be written In the cold,
formal record of her action for separate
maintenance at the hands of her husband,
Millionaire William H.Talbot: it' was re
called to determine whether or not she Is
entitled to a greater sum at this season,
when charities are to be aided, the poor
assisted and little ones and friends and
relatives remembered with gifts that bear
with them the warmth of affection, than
during the summer months when human
sentiments are less heavily taxed.
When this question was propounded the
attitude of defiance Mrs. Talbot had as
sumed, to' steady her voice and steel her
purpose was swept aside, and the ma
ternal Instinct prevailed. For the minute
she was not the wife of William H. Tal
bot, engaged with him in bitter litiga
tion, but was the mother of his children,
forgetful of all but their interests. As the
unhappy ; woman wept , Talbot sat with
folded arms, \ unmoved, no .trace of sym
pathy, marking his immobile- features, a
picture, of stoicism. v But hiÃ attorney,
William H. Jordan, dropped his eyes and
fingered some documents on the table in
front of him. and for him be it said that
for. the rest of the session his cross-exam
ination was less severe. , " .
DEVELOPMENTS TO COME.
The point most potent of developments
In tue future was that contained in the
statement to thecourtby Attorney Sam
uel M. Shortrldge 'that "a castle may be
come a place of horror, and that while
'Mrs.'; Talbot' s home is palatial it is in
tolerable, and that it Is her wish to leave
It because It Is the will of William, H.
Talbot that' she do leave it, and he is en
deavoring to see that she does." In this
charge there is hidden the view of ex
clusive circles that society has alienated
William H. Talbot from the little woman
who is yet his wife.
. Counsel contends that this society, how
ever, Is not that which recognizes the in
violability and sanctity of the home as us
foundation, but rather looks to social
achievements at the brilliant functions of
the : rich as tne stepping â¢ stone to great
ness in this "life and reward in ' the next.
It is the wish of some in * the veins of
whom the blood of Talbot flows that his
children be taÂ«.en to the East, there to
be educated , far from the environment
that now surrounds them. 11l health at
tendant upon the birth of her children,
and the strain of rearing them to conform
to her ideas, has left Mrs. Annie D. Tal
bot with but little time in which to wor
ship at the shrine of society. As she has
weaned herself away from the charm, of
Us glitter she has also nourished within
her little ones a love of home and a real
ization that in the home, when all Is well,
there lies the greatest happiness.
BATTLE OVER CHILDREN.
To those of the Talbot family that
have other Ideas there has come a hope
that the children may, escape this in
fluence that may stay the growth of
their 'social 'aspirations ' and education
for them in an Eastern college^ where
social training 'stands as the larger
part of the curriculum. - has "been sug
gested. William D. Talbot .Is not
averse to yielding to the wish of those
of his family that have thus Interested
themselves In his affairs," but. a full
measure of all of the heartaches that
such a course would bring -to . the
mother of his children has either not
been taken, or If It has, has not been
considered. *
. But Mrs. Annie D. Talbot will not
consent to give up' her. children. Aided
by counsel, she will wage a battle as
endless, unless victory be hers, : as the
affection she bears for the little brood
she brought into the world. There will
be .no member of the ' Talbot family,
that will escape a subpena- to j come to
court when the case in chief goes to
trial. Society will' be well, represented
in court and, .if the. theory; of counsel
for; Mrs. Talbot vbe" borne out by the
facts, Uherewiir.be told a tale of ;the
demands of society of which the ,iin- ;
elect : do not: even dream can exist
where royalty holds; no sway and
where the ladder of aspiration is built
of "sold. ~ ' "cÂ«. r .'"-'. '\u25a0':'.
When Mrs. Talbot was called to the
stand yesterday she was ,asked ; as to
what /sum she believed would be nec
essary for her; maintenance; pending
th*! final adjudication of the suit she
has instituted.;/ She answered that [ she
could spend s ssooo a month, very easily
if compelled togo to;a;hotel, and then,
after ia; moment's thought,! she Con
tinued: \"I | always try to ' live within
