Belshaw Gives an Account of Stewardship
1LZX WHO TOOK PROMINENT PART IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE OPENING
TAT OF THE ANNUAL. CONVENTION OF THE MINERS OF CALIFORNIA AT
T1IE HOTEL ST. KHAXCIS. â  .;_â '."
Nearly 400 delegates to the annual
convention of the California Miners*
Association assembled yesterday at
the St. Francis Hotel, listened to a
recital by President C. M. Belshaw
concerning the work in which the as
sociation has been engaged during the
year, resolved to remodel the consti
tution and by-laws of the organization
and began the consideration of the
work that is ahead.
The report of the president dealt
with matters of much concern to min
ers and others whose interests are af
fected. It va,s reported that while
there had been no attempt to attack
quartz or dredge mining under the
Kate Hayes decision. :t was advisable
that the association "rhould fortify
itself so as Fu<:eeFsfuIly to combat any
*-.Â£fort that might be made along the
line suggested."
Th<_* Caminetti act. so reported Pres
ident Belshaw. will | be brought Into
the SuDreme Court for a test when
the necessary costs are provided by
the miners to prosecute the suit. The
issue will be made in the Polar Star
mine case and final definition will- be
rought regarding hydraulic mining.
Dredger mining for. gold in the Oro
vllle district was described on ths ba
*is of a report made by a committee
that visited the field of operations as
"doing no material damage to the
river; dredge mining could be so con
ducted as to do absolutely no dam
age whatever." Laws to prevent the
operations of wildcat mining com
panies in this State v.ere recommend
ed by President Belshaw.

tence. with a request for an opinion as to whether
or not this decision might t>e made applicable
to Muartz and dredge mining. The universal
:-ep!y la . some " seven huncred letters which
were received by the association was to the
effect that thera Â«rai danger that this decision
might be used to the detriment of quartz and
dredge mining.
While there has been no attempt made as yet
to attack quarts or dredge mlnlrg under Oils
decision, there is no assurance that it will not
be mad?, and I am of the opinion that this
association should fortify ltrelf ko as to suc
cesjlully combat any effort which might be
made along the line suggested.
On March 3. 1SXW. a petition was received
froci the. miner* of /he Xanana River .district
of Alaska. requertinR thi5. acsociatlon to ute
Its influence for the purpose of having Cheena.
Alaekc. declared a port of entry. In order that
the inln-ni Â«! that Â«Jial:ict might receive better
transportation accommodations. This matter
was referred to .5Â«snator PÂ«rkins. who. upon,
investigation, informed the association that It
would be â¢ Impossible . to comply with the peti
tion.
At a meeting of the executive committee
held April 9. 1904. Messrs. Sollnsky & WehÂ«
meat kindly offered to take' the Polar Star
cape to the Supreme Court free of cost for at
torneye' fees, for- the purpoe* of getting an
adjudication at to the constitutionality of the
Camlnettl Â«ct. Messrs. Sollnsky & Wehe have
already done considerable work in the case in
the way of' correspondence and getting It in
proper shape to appeal to the Supreme Court,
and are now ready to go ahead and take the
appeal, and only await funds- to get copies of
the papers and also to print the record. It
seems to me that it ie of creat Importance
to hydraulic mining that we have a Supreme
Court decision en the Caminettl act, and I hope
that, eince Messrs. Sclfntky & Wehe have so
kindly volunteered their legal service? in the
matter, the association will see Its way clear
to provide for the necessary costs of conduct-
Ing the etiit.
DREDGING IS VIEWED.
In the early part of "Mar, 1904, a call was
made for a river convention to be held In San
Franciw-o on the 22d of that month, and It was
rumored that there might be some discussion
on the evil effects of dredge mining:. A special
meeting of the executive j committee was called
and It wai decided that the â  committee should
xo to Orovllle and make an examination of
the conditions : there in order that the repre
sentatives from this association to the river
convention might be thoroughly posted on
matters appertaining* to dredge mining. a
majority of the members of the executive com
mittee and Colonel Heuer of â  the California
Debris Commission - participated in this inves
tigation. We .were shown every courtesy by
the California Dredge Miners' Association of
Orovllle, and were given every opportunity
to Investigate the , working of the dredgers
of that district, both those that were â  work
ing In the river and those that were work
ing inland.. It was -the unanimous opinion of
the commute* â¢ that 'the dredgers of this dis
trict were doing no material * damage to the
river and ; that dredge -mining could- be so
conducted as to do absolutely no damage
whatever. - - \ ' , '
i Under data cf May 16. 1904. this associa

CRITICIZES
LAXITY OF
OUR LAWS
Conan Doyle Points
Out Danger to
â¢LONDON,- Dec. 6.~Lord Chief Jus
tice Alverstone was the principal guest
at the dinner cf the Authors' Club last
night. A. Conan Doyle; who presided
referred to the laxity of the law and
Its administration in the United States
and said that the great nation had out
grown its legal strength with appalling
results. While- Great Britain in the
Boer war lost 22,000 lives. ; the United
->n^ 8 ,, l0Bt> in tne same three years,
o- 000 lives through murder or homicide.
This, the speaker said, would be a pite
ous setback to the high hopes of those
who looked to America as the Utopia
of the future, but he added, America
would crush this foul growth by
strengthening the machinery of the law
and putting Judges on a higher basis.
Lord Alverstone in reply /said - he
agreed with every word Doyle had
spoken and that his remarks were
no stronger than he had heard from
many Americans themselves ; . But in
regard^ to the treatment . and reclama
tion of convicted criminals, . Lord â Al
verstone said^Creat Britain had much
to learn from America. . Americans he
said, were working hard to make their
system not only humane but trulv nre
ventlve of crime.

NEW YORK, Dec. 5.â Mrs. Cassie L..
Chadwick, whose financial difficulties
have caused widespread interest, is at
the Holland House tb'-night. At the
hotel are at least- three officers of the
United .States secret service and they
have been particularly alert for the
past twenty-four hours. A gentleman
closely connected. with the case says

Statutes which , provides " for the pun
ishment of any person, who "aids â , or
abets" a national bank official in the
performance of any act which is illegal,
Carpenter said thatlwhatever transac
tions Mrs. Chadwick had had with
bank officials had been strictly of a
business nature. She had borrowed
money as any person would,, and had
not interested herself in the capitaliza
tion of the bank in question. The law-'
yer.was asked what might be the result
if it could be shown that a violation "of
the statute which makes it a crime for
a person borrowing money fro-m a bank
to make a statement concerning her, as
sets or ability to meet the obligation
which was knowingly untrue. Car
penter reiterated his statement that
Mrs. Chadwick was absolutely innocent
of any wrong. â 
CAKXlXilK IS ANGERED.
Andrew Carnegie was shown a copy
of to-day's dispatch from Cleveland, in
which District Attorney Sullivan of
that city/ was quoted as having said
that he had recently in his possession
a note for $250,000 signed by Car
negie's name and indorsed on the back
"C. L. Chadwick." His secretary gave
out this statement: for Carnegie: .
"Mr. Carnegie says that it is years
since he has given a note of any kind
or indorsed any note. He says that
there are no notes, in his name out
standing at present. Mr. Carnegie
wants me to say. that' he does not want
to be bothered .;, any more about this
Chadwick woman. He is quite angry
over this persistent use of his name
and wishes it to cease at once. Once
for all, he never knew Mrs." Chadwick;
or any such other womani; and he
never signed, any such paper as the
reports credit him with. "That is all.".
; When the attention of Philip Car
penter was called to the dispatch that
notes purporting to have been signed
by, Andrew, Car negrie had been found
by "United States Bank Examiners he
disclaimed 'all knowledge of such notes
and, added: <â '.'.â 
X'.'Mrs. Chadwick has not only denied
that 'she is a relative of Mr. Carnegrie,
but has also 'denied that she; has ever

TOKIO, Dec. 6, 10 a- > m.â It is re
ported that the Japanese bombard
ment against the fleet at Port Arthur
is proceeding to the satisfaction of the
attacking forces. On the evening of
the 4th inst. (Sunday) tw6 or three
Russian ships were fired and burned
In a hiilf hour. Their names and the

LONDON, Dec. 6.â A dispatch . from

"Heavy firing continues at Port Ar

most determined and persistent efforts
to capture the northern forts.".
MUKDEN, Dec. 5.â A four-day artil

There is considerable illness among
the Russian troops, consequent upon
close confinement- to the trenches and
bomb-proofs and the continual nervous

nenkampff, who knew the ; movement
was maturing, awaited the Japanese
at the mouth of. one of the' captured
passes, and that the Japanese turning
force threw itself unsuspectingly, into
the ambuscade, where, after the. fight,
the .'Russians collected 500 Japanese
corpses.'. â  . .>
It* Is ; added that there are 1000 more
Japanese corpses. -which it is impossi
ble to collect, owing to the fire of the
Japanese. -This does not include the
Japanese loss In wounded.
The, Russian loss, according to this
account, was only thirty or forty men.
.KNTRAPPED AT POUTIL.OFF. -
On the night of December 2 the Jap
anese began a heavv artillery fire on
PeutllofÂ£,;(Lone Tree) Hill, paving the
way for an Infantry attack. The Rus
sian artillery answered vigorously for
several hours and then slackened. The
Japanese, believing the. Russian fire
had; been silenced, flung themselves In
masses â against the trenches, where
they were allowed to come within close
range and then' were met with wither
ing volleys; and a counter charge with
the bayonet. The Japanese fled, hav
ing sustained enormous losses.
A Cossack expedition which was sent
on the tiight of December 2 to capture
a Japanese battery, on the Russian
rierht flank was only partly, successful.
The â  Cossacks killed the Japanese sen
tries and gunners and got possession
of the battery, but were unable to re
move the Runs, owing to the rapid ar
rival of Japanese reinforcements.
On December 3 Captain Gichkoon and
Corporal Companetz crawled - v up close
to' the Japanese position, where they re
mained under a heavy flre all day,
making sketches of the, whole position,
and returning In safety.
An, attack by Japanese on Poutlloff
Hill on December 3 was probably due
in part to a wish, to distract attention
from sapper operations on -a neighbor
ing hill. near the, village of Shakhe, but
these - operations were "discovered and
repulsed, and the Japanese fled.
' RUSSIAN NIGHT ATTACKS.
Skirmishes continue. On the night of
November 30 Captain Alexandroff, with
thirty.men, routed a force of fifty Jap
anese by , a surprise attack on the
trenches. The : same night' volunteers
under; Lieutenant Videtska surrounded
and 5 destroyed â¢ a picket of., twenty-five
Japanese near Tougcru. This led to a
hand-to-hand fight in the'Japanese un
derground trenches, where twenty more"
Japanese were i bayoneted. The Rus
sians lost severely in this fight, a num
ber .being : caught : in â ." wire entangle

killed and fourteen wounded."

Dollars in Auction Sale In
London.
LONDON, Dec. 6. â What Is be
lieved to be a y genuine Romney, done
in that artist's best period, has Just
been sold at auction for $34,000. The
painting was part of the estate of a
man who lived in a miner's cottage
at White Haven, Cumberland, and
who had a hobby for buying and
cleaning pictures. Every picture he
cleaned he spoiled.
For some reason he did not clean
the Romney, and after his death It
was found tied nv /with two other
pictures, which, with the. Romney, he
had bought for less than $5. One of
the three Is believed also ' to be a
Gainsborough, though it brought only
$200 at the sale.
I The Romney canvas measures 60 by
47 inches. It Is a portrait of two
children walking in a landscape, ac

Supreme Court Decides Affalnst Ex

WASHINGTON. Dec. 5.â Justice
Brown to-day delivered the opinion of
the Supreme Court of the United
States in the case of C. M. Thomas
vb. the United States, involving the
rigtits of naval officers in respect to
extra pay under the naval personnel
acts of 1900 u.nd 1901. The opinion
is in favor of the Government. The
claim presented was that naval of
ficers who go to sea should be allowed
10 per cent in excess of their usual
pay because the increase is made to
army officers who are assigned to duty
at sea or at a foreign port.
Thomas is a captain in the navy
and mad* claim for the extra pay be
cause of his service in the Philippines,
in China and at sea. Most of his
claims were allowed by the Court of
Claims, but this decision was to-day
reversed.

TO EXTEND
STRONG ARM
OF THE LAW
Moody Would Break
Bars Between
States.
WASHINGTON, Dec". ; 6.â Attorney
General W. H. Moody, in his annual
report to Congress, recommends the
enactment of a law .which will provide
that where an indictment is* duly re
turned to a court of the United States
the Judge of that court may, in his
discretion, issue a bench warrant for
the arrest of the defendants wherever
they may be found within the territo
rial limits of the United States, and
that It phall be the duty of all nersons
authorized to serve such process to
arre6t the person or -persons indicted,
and if they fail after reasonable oppor
tunity to furnish bail for their appear
ance, to bring; them to the court in
which the indictment has been found.
The Attorney General explains that
much embarrassment in the adminis
tration of law has arisen from the in
ability of the United States to bring
an offender to the place and the court
where he must be tried. By the con
stitution the trial of all cases must be
held in "the State and district where
in the offenses shall have been commit
ted."
WOULD PUT EXD TO DEI/AYS.
It frequently happens that persons
accused are not found within the lim
its of the district where the offenses
alleged against them are triable. The
frequency of such cases increases with
the gravity of the accusation and
where it consists of a conspiracy, al
most invariably one or more of the al
leged offenders' are without the juris
diction of the district. â¢
That at some time injustice might
result to individuals, says the Attor
ney General, cannot be denied. The
occasionaJ abuse of power is insepara
ble from its existence. That innocent
men now and then are indicted for
crime must be confessed, but the-in
dictment of a Grand Jury, guided, as
such a body usually is, by the instruc
tions of the Judge and the counsel of
the District Attorney, affords assur
ances that such instances of oppression
will be rare indeed. On the other hand,
the possibility of delays and defeats of
Justice which the present system af
fords ! renders the power of the United
States ridiculous and brings contempt
upon the administration of the law.
BIG CASES IXSTAXCED. H" i
In support of his views Moody cited
a numbeivof cases in which Justice has
been defeated or greatly delayed and
large expense unnecessarily incurred
by the Government. Among these
cases is that of the co-defendants. with
Captain Oberlln M. Carter In the Sa
vannah Harbor improvement frauds.
Moody outlines the proceedings and
says that only after a delay of twen
ty-six months did the United States
reach the point where, - under the law,
it was permitted to take men, charged
with a grave crime to the place pro
vided by the constitution Sot their trial.
Then the two defendants -whose pres
ence was most desired .fled the coun
try and, although persistent and con
tinued effort for their ** recovery ' has
been made, they are still at large. Un
til they shall be apprehended it has
been deemed undesirable to proceed
with the trial of the other defandants
upon the indictment.
Another case, he says, is that of
George W. Beavers, under indictment
in connection with the postoffice
frauds. In relation to the case the At
torney General says:
FIASCO OF BEAVERS.
"When Beavers can be obtained for
trial no one can predict with certainty.
How much further immunity from trial
the intricacies of practice, the delays
of the courts and the ingenuity of
counsel may serve to procure for him
no one can foretell. It can only be
ho^ed that at some time before the
witnesses are dead or have forgotten
the circumstances, the power of the
United States may "i be proved to be
sufficient to bring the accused 228 miles
to the place appointed by the constitu
tion for his trial."
Another case Is that of Hyde, Ben
son, Dimond and Schneider, indicted in
February last in the District of Colum
bia for defrauding the Government of
large tracts of public lands. Only one
of these defendants thus far has been
placed under bail for trial, and yet the
case, the report says, has cost the Gov
ernment 120,000.
SUGAR COMPANY .LOSES.
Circuit Court's Decision in Govern

WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. â The Su

ican Sugar Refining Company of New
York vs. the United States, thus in ef
fect affirming the decision of the Cir

sugar refineries to test the validity of
the treasury regulations allowing for
the temperature modifications of the

MANY BILLS
ON SUBJECT
OF TARIFF
Several Are Introduced
First Day in the
House.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â Several bills
relating to the tariff were introduced in
the House of Representatives to-day.
The bill of Representative Spaldlng of
North Dakota provides for a tariff com
mission. The preamble of the bill re
cites that no ordinary session of Con
gress can fully investigate the subject
and determine what changes will best
promote the general welfare. Nine com
missioners are to investigate and report
to Congress recommendations. N as to
necessary changes in the tariff.
Representative Fordney of Michigan
also offered a tariff commission bill.
Representative Lovering of Massa
chusetts proposed three bills. The first
provides for the allowance of a draw
back and the remission of internal rev
enue, taxes on articles consumed on
vessels clearing for foreign countries
from United States ports. The second
provides for a drawbaok on imported
articles on which duties have been paid
which are used in the production of or
are joined to or form an inseparable
part of articles produced in the United
States. The third provides that where
imported materials on which duties
have been paid are used as coverings or
wrappings of articles produced in the
United States there shall be allowed on
the exportation of such articles a draw
back equal in amount to the duties
paid on the materials used as such cov
erings.
Representative Baker of New York
introduced a resolution reciting that
the tariff is a fraud on the American
people wherever it is levied on any ar
ticle whose labor cost is less in the
United States than anywhere else. The
resolution especially mentions steel, and
reseolves "that this despicable fraud on
the American people be stopped by di
recting the Secretary of the Treasury
to suspend the collection of the tariff
tax of $7 84 a ton on steel rails until
such time as the United States Steel
Corporation and others furnish conclu
sive evidence that the amount paid by
them to their employes for producing a
ton of steel rails is greater than that
paid by English steel rail manufactur
ers." .:.;â¢
Baker also introduced a resolution
calling on the Attorney General to
communicate to the House his opinion
as to the extent to which the alleged
combination of steel manufacturing
companies to restrict the output and fix
the price of steel constitutes a viola
tion of law.

BIG DEFICIT
IN NATION'S
FINANCES
Over .Forty Millions,
Including Canal
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.â In his an-,
nual report, for^the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1904, submitted to Congress to
day, Secretary of the Treasury Shaw
states that the total receipts for that
period were $634,214,373 14, and the ex
penditures $725,984,945 65. leaving a de
ficit of 541.770,571 91. The expenditures
Include the payment of $50,000,000 for
the Panama canal. Compared with the
fiscal year 1903, the receipts decreased
over $10,000,000 and the expenditures In
creased over $85,000,000, due mostly to
the Panama canal purchase, the in
crease in the navy and the discontinu
ance of war taxes.. .For the present
year the estimates provide for a deficit
Of $18,000,000, and for the year following
a surplus of $22,000,000.
Transactions in the interest-bearing
public debt resulted in a net reduction
in the principal of $19,383,970 and a de
crease In the annual interest charge of
$1,364,828 30.
The total stock of money in the coun
try at the close of the fiscal year 1904
was $2,803,504,135, an increase of $118,
793,148 over the preceding year. The
extraordinary 'amount of $42,193,282 94
in foreign gold coin and bullion and
$29,158,970 31 . in domestic bullion was
deposited in the Mint at San Francisco
during the year and paid for by the lo-""
cal office or by telegraphic exchange on
New York. .' â¢
The Secretary points out that steps
must soon be taken to provide bullion
for subsidiary coinage. He adds:
"In this connection, it may be pointed
out that no provision now exists for the
recoinage of standard silver dollars
which by natural wear have become
unfit for circulation. Many such are
now In the Treasury. They cannot be
recolned into dollars without loss, and
there Is no authority to reimburse such
loss. As the subsidiary coins are of
lighter proportionate weight than the
standard silver dollars, these abraded
and uncurrent coins might be recoined
into subsidiary silver coin without
loss."
MORE PLIABLE RESERVE.
It is recommended that the act provid
that "whenever and so long as the gold
coin held in the reserve fund in the
Treasury for the redemption of United
States notes and Treasury notes shall
fall and remain below $100,000,000 the au
thority to issue gold certificates be sus
pended" be changed by inserting the
words "and bullion" after "gold coin."
"The effect of the proposed amend
ment," says the Secretary, "would be to
vest in the Secretary- erf the Treasury
discretionary power as to the.propor
tion of coin and bullion in the reserve,
and it would be his duty to keep at all
times sufficient coin in the fund to meet
the demand." . , . '
The interest bearing debt ' oh'Novem
ber 1; 1904.. was $895,157,770. :
A reorganization of the customs dis
tricts , on a more^ businesslike basis is
recommended,* in view of the fact that
it costs more. to maintain eome stations
than' is collected 'there in revenues.
Among these is Humboldt, Cal., where
it costs $6 to collect $1.
Of the revenue' service the report
states that several new vessels are re
quired to replace an old, obsolete and
worn-out class, and at least one for a
new station at 'â " Honolulu, Hawaii.
There is' no vessel of the revenue cut
ter service available for service In Ha
waiian waters, where one is needed.
The Bear and the Thetis are annually
dispatched by the service for the re
lief and protection of whaling and oth
er interests in the Bering Sea and Arc
tic Ocean. They are still In great need
of extensive repairs and it is recom
mended that they be given the neces
sary overhauling. *â¢â
PAPER 3IOXEY DEMAND.
Preparations are being made for the
erection of wireless telegraph towers
at convenient intervals along the sea
coast. These ; towers, together with
those maintained by. private corpora
tions, will afford opportunity for
advantageous use of wireless teleg
raphy by the revenue cutter service.
This, service now has a coast guard of
modern vessels, ; and : the Secretary rec
ommends that at least ten of these be
provided with approved wireless equip
ment for communication with. the coast
stations.
All amounts which have become due
to the United States under the agree
ment dated February 1, 1899, for the
settlement of the indebtedness of the
Central Pacific * Railroad Company
have been paid by the railroad com
pany in full, including interest on all
outstanding notes to August 1, 1904.
The principal of all notes held August
1, 1904, amounted to: $26,465,722 02, and
first mortgage bonds to the amount or
$26,466,000 are held as security for the
payment thereof.
"Our currency system," says the re
port, "thousrh* somewhat complicated,
has been proved safe. and reliable un
der every practical test. The. exchange
of gold for all forms of money issued
or coined by* the Government, on de
mand, authorized by .act of Congress
approved March; 14, 1900, , removes ev
ery suggestion .of public distrust or
doubt. The system has one. recognized
weakness, however: it is nonelastic.
This criticism is sometimes | answered
by the statement that national banks
possess the power ; to â¢ increase circula
tion at will. Actual experience demon
strates the insufficiency of this prerog

To meet a demand for paper money

FOR GALLANT
OLD SOLDIER
LOS ANGELES, - Dec, 5.â Colonel
Isaac PL Dunkelberger, United States
Army < (retired), distinguished soldier
and citizen, and postmaster of Los
Angeles from 1878 to 1884, died to-day,
aged 72.
One hour after President Lincoln's
call" for 75.000 men .had been officially
proclaimed by - Governor Andrew
G. Curtln of Pennsylvania, Dun
kelberger enlisted in the ... First
Pennsylvania . Infantry. . , After .- the
battle of Bull Run, Dunkel
berger, who had been appointed cap
tain of Company E, First United States
Cavalry, served in all me great battles
of the Army of the Potomac and was
wounded twice, once- dangerously at
Trevillian Station. He commanded the
escort of General Meade.at the battle
of Gettysburg, and was recommended
for a brevet. He also served with dis
tinction in the Indian wars in Arizo
na from 1867 to 1871, and then resigned
on account of his disabled shoulder.
In 1876 President Grant reappointed
the colonel as captain In the regular
army, but he declined on account of
trouble from his old wound. In 1901
President McKinley, appointed him a
captain of cavalry, so that he might
be retired, which went through Con

POPE IS TAKEN
SUDDENLY ILL
After Conducting Elaborate
Ceremony Pius Suffers
From Attack of the Gout
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, Dec. 5. â After apparently en-
Joying the best of health since his ele
vation to the chair of St Peter, at the
morning session of the Consistory, his
Holiness Pope Pius X was this aft
ernoon suddenly seized with a recur
rence of his old complaint, the grout,
and had to be aided to his apart
ments. Dr. Lapponi and the sisters of
his Holiness were summoned, and at
their suggestion the Pontiff took to his
bed in order to regain his strength for
Thursday's ceremony, Dr. Lapponi
said there was no reason to feel
alarmed over the Pope's condition, that
it was not serious, and that a few
hours* rest would restore htm to per
fect health.
The Pope this morning held a con
sistory for the canonization of blessed
Gerardo Malella and blessed Alessan
dro Sauli, one of the chief functions of
the celebration of the golden jubilee of
the' proclamation. oCVttre dogma of the
Immaculate 'Conception. -The weather
was springlike, adding to â¢ the general
feeling of good will. The Pontiff went
to' the Hall of. the:. Cqnsistory, â  where
there was a most imposing gathering
of nigh. prelates, said to be the largest
since the fall of the temporal power of
the Popes, but the public was not ad
mitted.
Pope Pius, wearing his full pontifical
robes, seated himself on the throne
immediately after entering the hall. He
then recited in a sonorous .voice the
prayers for the occasion and proceeded
to expound the reasons which induced
him to sanction the canonization of the
new saints, inviting the sacred college
to give their views, which each, of the
Cardinals read in Latin. The Cardinals
were followed by Patriarchs. Archbish
ops and Bishops, including those from
the United States and Canada.
After this. the Pope proceeded to St.
Peter's, where the solemn rites of the
canonization were performed.
Later the Pope received in St Peter's
all the members of the International
Congress of the Virgin Mary, which
met to-day in Rome. Many foreigners,
including the American ecclesiastics
now in Rome, were also jiresent.
The Pope blessed the crown, com
posed of twelve stars of brilliants and
valued at $30,000, which will be placed
on the Madonna, whose image was
crowned by Pope Pius IX when he pro
claimed the dogma of the Immaculate
Conception. .
Replying to the address of Cardinal
Vannuteni, the Pope said the jubilee of
the Immaculate ConcÂ«ption was a new
affirmation of Christian feeling, true
religion and sincere loyalty to the pon
tificate, itssna
All the prelates and others were per

A policeman heard cries from under

An urgent call for more help brought
a flreboat and three members of a near

I desire to aea:n call the attention of the
association to the matter of wildcat mining
companies, and I earnestly urge the necessity

business for an time these illegitimate schemes
which have a tendency to oast a shadow on
legitimate mining enterprises.
While the association during the past year
tas had no active contests in behalf of mining
<m lta hands, nevertheless it has been alert
for the interests and welfare of mining in
*.; ltÂ« branches and has ever been ready to
extend a helping hard when called upon so
to Co. ** V ' â¢â â â ".Â£
I am eonr to note a lack of Interest In

Interested and for whom the ase-jciatlon stands
In a position u> do the mo*t good. I sincerely
hepe that this apathy will clve way to an

the association can do and that the comme

throughout the State of Calif om.a laboring
band in hand under the banner of the as

I desire to here publicly express my appre

poor secretary, E. H. Benjamin, ha* alwaya

to you. rsy fellow delegates, that whatever
COod the association haÂ» done In the past few
yÂ«-ars lies been through the untiring: efforts
of your secretary, and I now publicly thank

SPEECHES ARE BRIEF.
There was not much speech making:
on the opening day of the convention.
"W. C. Ralston described, without notes,
In an extremely interesting way, the
gold mining sections known as Tono
pah, Goldfield and the newer Xevada
camp of Bullfrog. He said that the
gniaera of Tonopah did not take any
account of ore that ran less than $40
a ton and that the Goldfield miners
f.xed the limit at $60 a ton when they
vere considering shipments out of
their districts. He believed strongly
in a treat future for Goldfield and for
Tonopah and predicted that in five
years they would make a record that
would amaze the world. He expressed
surprise that the miners of California
and the capitalists of San Francisco
had been so little represented at Tono
pah and at Goldfield, where Eastern
men 4T.d Eastern capital were reaping
returns.
At the forenoon session the Pioneers
â were complimented. Niles Searls ajid
"Jake" Neff were called upon and were
warmly applauded when they spoke.
Mr. Neff said that he was glad always
tu lend his voice for the success of the
California Miners' Association. His
every effort since the organization of
the association had been for its suc
cess. Mining was one of the greatest
industries of California. There was no
.reason why it should languish.
Xiles Searls said he had been con
certed v.ith mining In California ever
since 1S4S. The conventions of the Cal
â¢ifornia Miners" Association should be
instrumental in placing before the min
ers new ideas. Papers were read last
year in the miners' convention of great
value. Good results were sure to fol
low the convention of 1904. Some man
â whose head extended above his ears
was sure to provide something of im
portance to miners during the pro
ceedings of the convention.
AXDERSOX WELCOMES.
In extending welcome to the miners
in behalf of the State, in the absence
<it Governor Pardee, Lieutenant Gov
ernor Alden Anderson said in sub
stance that it afforded him great pleas
ure to greet those present. The people
of California were and always had been
interested in the mining industry of
the State, to which was due the first
great Immigration. The argonauts
were greater than were the compan
ions of Jason who sought for the gold
en fleece. They doubled Cape Horn,
crossed the isthmus, journeyed over
the plains, incurred danger and hard
ships in many forms and founded a
great State. There -xas present as
delegates at this convention pioneers
and desce^ of pioneers. All could
look with pride at the pioneers..
The Lieutenant Governor also Eald
that mining methods had changed.
JCow electricity, the modern stamp
mill, cyanide and chlorinatlon plants
and tn<Â» gold dredger have taken the
places of the pan and pick and rocker.
He added: "I believe I echo the gen
eral sentiment of the people in so say
ing, the mining industry Is wished suc
cess and the hope is entertained that it
may proceed with as little interference
and abridgment as possible."
The speaker referred to the possible
reed for new legislation. He said that
there was no industry in the State in
â which the conditions were bo favorable
for harmony. Gold had its own value
end was not subject to competition in
seeking a market For this reason
miners could act harmoniously and
unanimously. "The more prosperous
each and every miner is, the better it
Trtl! be for the State erf California."
Delegate Campbell read a paper
about hvdraulic gravel elevators and
asserted that the heavy material of
Alaska could be handled by the hy
draulic elevator at 10 cents a cubic
yard and that in California the cost
â¢would not exceed E cents a cubic yard.
TO FRAME RESOLUTION'S,
A comraittee jon resolutions was ap
pointed, composed of the following:

TO SET YOUR LIVER WORKING RIGHT
I is absolutely imperative if you are to get any comfort from life or
; nourishment from food. A torpid liver can be a \ery dangerous
condition and should not be neglected. Few medicines act as
thoroughly, promptly and safely as Beecham's Pills. They are .
I \igorous but mild, and cause no Inconvenience 1 or nausea.
1 TO BE RID OF CONSTIPATION
* There is no remedy quite as good as Beecham's Pills, not only; to
I loosen the bowels but in the after effects. There is no binding up
I afterwards, as these Pills aid Nature in a natural way. Persons
J chronically constipated can become regular and be rid of the con--
I sequent discomforts formerly theirs by use of BEECHAM'S PILLS. .

ty and Harry E. Bush of Shasta were

A report was received from the Unit
ed States engineers composing' the Cali
fornia Debris Commission relating to
the progress of the barriers on the Yu
ba River. The work is proceeding on
three sections. The first barrier, rising
six feet from the river bottom, is com
pleted. About half the work at Da
guerre Point is finished and 6000 feet of
a dike constructed there by W. P.
Hammon is also finished. A wide cut
has been about half completed at Da
guerre Point for the purpose of divert
ing the entire flow of the Yuba River
at high stages of water. On the third
section, near Marysville, easements on
property have been largely secured and
the surveying for a great settling basin
has been performed.
The first resolution that was Intro
duced referred to the necessity for good
roads to- the mines of the State.

Pacific squadron, which heretofore has
been repressed, is now growing more
acute, and prominent newspapers are
voicing the demand for determined ac
tion by the Japanese Government.
Apparently much will depend on the
course of events when the Russian
warships arrive in Oriental waters. If
the SQuadron shall have been permit
ted to exceed a fair construction of
neutrality it is probable that Japan
will consider herself under no obliga
tion to observe neutrality, and may
send her. fleet after the Russians into
ports of neutrality, of which she be
lieves the Russians are violating. If
the Russians seize a base in neutral
territory Japan probably will do like
wise, should urgency demand such acÂ«
tion.
Japan is keenly anxious to avoid
complications, but she will forcefully
insist upon what she considers her
rights.
Preparations for meeting 1 the Rus
sian warships are proceeding on an ex
tensive scale, partlculai+y in the ease
of the navy, which is confident of solv
ing the problem under fair conditions!
The preparations of the army include
the calculation that the Russians maj
attempt to cut the Japanese communi
cations to the Liaotung- Peninsula, but
when the Russian vessels arrive the
Japanese armies in Manchuria expect
to be in a position to carry on a cam
paign of many months without thÂ«
necessity of communicating with
Japan.
Commercial concerns expect a tem
porary disappointment In the matter
of mall and maritime service when thÂ«
Russian squadron arrives.
HAY DRAFTS NEW NOTE.
â WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. â Secretary
I Hay has drafted a circular note to
I the powers informing them of the an
! swers made by all the powers to
| which was addressed the note setting
forth President Roosevelt's suggestion
that they engage in a second peace
conference at The Hague. This sec
ond note will include Russia's an
swer that the time is not opportune
for a peace conference . .while the
j Russo-Japanese war continues. It
! will not be transmitted to the powers
for several days, by which time it is
expected Japan's answer will have
been received.
No statement is made upon the sub
ject, but it is believed the Govern
ment will not rest content ;$vith the
powers' acceptance of the principle of
the suggestion. The first opportune
moment will be taken advantage of to
set the date nrid place and to outline
the questions to be dealt with. This
will be decided bv mutual agreement
among the powers, the United States
merely acting as* the custodian of
their respective opinions.

of the Dmitri Donskol and Aurora suddenly
appeared on the left of the ironclad division.
The Dmitri Donskoi showed nignt nignals,
â¢whereupon, fearing projectiles from the hind
most 6hlps of our division should hit our own
vessels, either by direct or by ricochet, a gen
eral signal to cease fire was made from the
Souvaroff. The order was- at once obeyed.
The whole firing lasted less than ten minutes.
Communication by wireless stated that five
projectiles struck the Aurora, some rlcochetting
and others hitting direSt. Three were "G-mil

NOTES BEAR *
CARNEGIE'S
SIGNATURE
Continued From Page 1, Column' 4.
of Andrew Carnegie and was indorsed
by C. L. Chadwick. A widely-known
banker, who requested that his name
be not used, said positively that he had
seen the $500,000 note, signed "Andrew
Carnegie." This banker said he was
not familiar enough with Carnegie's
signature to say positively whether the
signature was genuine or a forgery.
Receiver Nathan Loeser filed his bond
to-day, thus making him the legal cus
todian of all property owned by Mrs.
Chadwick.
It is said that the approval of Loes
er'a bond ties up absolutely all of Mrs.
Chadwick's property, and not a dollar
of her debts can be paid out of the pro
ceeds of the estate. All creditors, it is
said, must share alike. This is supposed
to apply to the -Newton- claim if there
is any attempt to pay it out of money
that may be due to the estate.
> BECKWITH'S CONFESSION.
In the United States District Attor
ney's office to-day President C. T. Beck
with of the' failed Citizens' National
Bank of Oberlin made & confession re
garding: the bank's transactions with
Mrs. Cassie L. Chqdwick.,. Beckwith
said:.' . -'" . " . ..." .â¢;,-' â -.. ".-'.'. ' â¢>, â / *
"I am either an awful dupe -or a, ter
rible fool. I guess there is no doubt
about my being a fool."
Beckwith's acquaintance with Mrs.
Chadwick began three years ago. The
attorneys for Herbert D. Newton, the
Brookline, Mass., banker, have stated
that their client loaned Mrs. Chadwick
money only after a note signed "An
drew Carnegie" had been indorsed by
the president and cashier of a national
bank. The men who indorsed the note
were President Beckwith and Cashier
Spear of the Citizens' National Bank of
Oberlin, Ohio. Explaining this matter
Banker Beckwith continued his story
of the bank's transactions with Mrs.
Chadwick as follows:
"Yes, we indorsed the note, in addi
tion to one other note for $500,000, but
never for the purpose for which they
were used."
"Do you mean to say that there are
two $500,000 notes in addition to the
note for $250,000?" was asked.
"Yes, notes aggregating $1,250,000."
"It has not been generally understood
that there were two notes for $500,000,"
was suggested.
"I know it, but the notes exist just
the same," said Beckwith. "One of them
is in the hands of the receiver, and the
other ought to be in the hands of Mrs.
Chadwick. If she has disposed of it^she
has done something which she swore
she would not do, so please make it
plain that a solemn oath was taken
that the notes which bear our indorse
ment were never to be used by -Mrs.
Chadwick for the purpose of raising
money, and she knewit."
FORGERY NOT SUSPECTED.
"Did you have the slightest suspicion
that the notes carrying the name of
Andrew Carnegie were not genuine?"
"Mrs. Chadwick swore to both of us
and v one or more witnesses that she
personally saw Mr. Carnegie sign' his
name to the notes she placed before
us. But we said that we must be sure.
The answer came in less than two
days, when a New York attorney ap
peared In Oberlin who said he was the
attorney of Mr. Carnegie â his special
agent. He vouched for. the correctness
of the claims made by Mrs. Chadwick.
We had at least six conferences with
this lawyerâ two In Oberlin and. four
in Cleveland.
"It was -over a year ago that- I
learned that W. 5 S. Fay and Henry
Wurst : of Elyria had' some dealings
with Mrs. Chadwick. They were known
as shrewd business men. I began to
inquire, for as a' business man I want
ed to exert every effort to turn an hon
est dollar. I guess my inquiries reached
the ears of Mrs. Chadwick, in the light
of events of , the past ; t wo â¢ weeks. She
came to Oberlin, and it was there 1 the
thing began. A second interview and
I made, a .small loan, i; It was protnptly
met. 'In addition we secured additional
splendid business and all transacted â¢ in

the bank: When I got, to; New York
my heart failed 'â  me, for, something told
me that all was not right. I came back
home without an attempt to raise mon
ey on the note. .
"Mrs. Chadwick had secured high
loans from many other bankers. ' She
had, met -these obligations. Would she
not meet; obligations to the Oberlin
Bank ? . â¢ We prayed that she would and
we thought -that 'she would."

ROBS THE SANTA FE OVERLAND
AND SHOOTS BRAVE MESSENGER
Bold Grime of Bandit in the South
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5.â As a result
of a daring and partially successful at
temDt to rob the express car of the
Santa Fe Overland Limited train No. 1,
west bound, at an' early hourHo-day,
"Wells-Fargo Express Messenger Evan
O. Roberts lies in a dying condition at
the Sisters' Hospital in this city, a
sum of money is missing from the way
safe of the express car and the bandit
is in hiding somewhere on the desert
in the vicinity of Daggett. ",Â»'.-â¢
The' robbery occurred after the train
left Needles last night and before it
reached Daggett at 2 o'clock this morn
ing. Just at what point and what hour
the robbery and shooting occurred has
not definitely been determined . owing
to Messenger Roberts' inability to
make a clear statement. Posses are
searching the country along the line of.
the railroad and feel confident they
will capture the bandit.
Messenger Roberts believes the rob
ber was a negro.- He has been unable
to give the details of the affair, but
from the fact that the door to the ex-

press car shows it j was battered with
some heavy instrument,, it is probable
that the bandit broke into the car by
force. The interior of the car gave
evidence, of a struggle, - during which,
it is assumed, the bandit fired the shot
which sent a bullet through Roberts'
body. He then took the keys from Rob
erts' pocket and' opened the way safe,
taking all the money in sight. Just
how much this is cannot <be learned.
The express company officials positive
ly decline to talk, but let it be known
that about $400 is missing.
It Is not believed, either by the po
lice of Los Angeles or by the railway
officials, that - the robbery was other
than the act of a desperate man, in
experienced in that particular sort of
crime. There are no evidences that
more than one man was engaged in the
affair and Messenger Roberts has man
aged to tell that he saw only one man,
whom he took, in the dim light of the
car, to be a negro.
When the train arrived at Daggett
about 2 o'clock this morning 1 , Conduc
tor Hawes had occasion to go to the
express car. Failing to receive a re-
sponse to his repeated knocking at the
side door, he went to the end door 1 and
found it unfastened. Making his way
into the car he found Messenger Rob
erts lying on the floor with an ugly
looking bullet wound in his breast.
Roberts was conscious, but unable to
talk. The bullet had passed entirely
through- the body, piercing the right
lung. Conductor Hawes nad the mes
senger made as comfortable as pos
sible and notified the railroad and ex
press officials in this city. When the
train reached Barstow an employe of
the express company took charge of the
car and its contents.
Late to-night it is thought that Mes
senger Roberts will not recover. He
is one of the oldest Wells-Fargo mes
sengers. In point of service, running
out of Los Angeles, and has a wife
and children living here.

The're is a nobler purpose â one of

The daughters would succor the men
who shouldered muskets and offered
their lives in defense of that which they

BELITTLE CASE
OF GOVERNMENT
Attorneys for the Defense
in Oregon Land Frauds
Talk in Behalf of Clients
PORTLAND, Dec. 5.â The argument
of counsel for the defense in the land
fraud cases commenced to-day, Law
rence F. Puter of Eureka, Cal., brother
of one of the defendants, being the
first speaker to address the court and
Jury on behalf of the persons accused
by the Federal Government of a con
spiracy to defraud the United States
out of public lands. The speaker held
that JLhe' Government had failed to
make out its case against the prisoners,
and attacked the testimony of the
Government's principal witnesses, Mon
tague and Heidecke, as being unworthy
of belief. â¢ -,..â¢â â 
Counsel claimed that the principals in
the defense were innocent purchasers
of the lands and not responsible for de
ceptions practiced upon them, and that
the persons whom the Government
claims are fictitious are living human
beings, who actually went upon the
lands in question.
Judge O'Day ridiculed the testimony
of the defense' and belittled the wit
nesses. His argument was' exhaustive
in detail and covered the history of the
case from Its inception. When Judge
O'Day concluded the . court adjourned
until to-morrow. T It â  will take another
day to finish the trial. Special prose
cutor Heney will occupy the forenoon
with argument and possibly lap over
into the afternoon. Following this will
â¢come the charge to the jury by Judge
Bellinger. It is thought that the delib
erations of the Jury will be brief..
YOUXG PUTNEY DISCHARGED

False Pretenses.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 5. â The War
Department has directed that Recruit
Stephen Putney Jr. of the general
service, Jefferson Barracks. Missouri,
be discharged without honor from the
army on the ; ground ' that he enlisted
under false 'pretenses. Putney Is a
young Virginian, who recently got
into trouble in St. Louis, resulting In
-the loss of all his money.
One of the stories was that he had
been i ' kidnaped . and robbed of some
valuable family jewelry, and that ' he
enlisted in the army while suffering
from \ the â  effects of a' drug given him
! by the kidnapers. ; Putney is the son
of a wealthy Southern family.

BEBEL AGAIN
IT HIS CONS
German Socialist Throws
; Shot Into the Government
Camp for Growth of Debt
BERLIN, Dec. 5.â Herr Bebel. the
Socialist leader and the keenest .critic
of the Government at all times, ana-,
lyzed the budget in the Reichstag to
day. Secretary of the Treasury von
Stengel, he said, had sketched on Sat
urday the deplorable financial situation
of the empire in terms so true that he
regretted the French custom could not
be followed and the speech be posted
throughout the country as a minister
ial declaration of the position into
which the country, had been drawn by
the Government's policies', the national
debt having increased $100,000,000 dur
ing the year.
Why, then, he asked, should the
army be increased? Why should the
naval programme be continued? Why
should immense sums be sunk in the
colonies? Why should these and other
policies that together formed the so
called "world policy" be ! carried for
ward on an enlarged scale when the
country was thereby being brought Into
the most serious I financial embarrass
ment?, If the "world policy" is essen
tial to Germany, as pursued in former
years, why expand that policy by loans
that mortgaged the empire's future and
laid permanent burdens upon the In
dustrial activities of the country?
Herr Bebel, who spoke for about
three hours, discussed the 1 details of
the appropriations, deducing there
from that on works of general public
utility the Government was parsimo
nious, while on "glory policies" it was
generous at the cost of going into debt.

DENVER, Dec. 5.â Frank J. Kratke.
the city license inspector; Joseph Ray,
Edward O'Malia and Charles Kofsky
were to-day adjudged guilty of con
tempt by the State Supreme Court and
were sentenced to Jail. The sentences
are as follows: Kratke, one year im
prisonment and $1000 fine and costs;
Ray and O'Malia, six months* Impris
onment and $500 fine and costs each;
Kofsky, three months" imprisonment
and $250 fine and costs.
These men were officials in the re
cent election and were accused of dis
regarding the court's lnjunctive order.
The principal charge against them was
that they permitted repeating. Carl
Wilson, election clerk in the same pre
cinct, was found not guilty of contempt.
Arguments were heard this afternoon
on the contempt charges made against
six other election officials. Experts
George H. King and M. M. Hamma
submitted reports differing In detail,
but practically agreeing that sixty-one
Democratic ballots were written by
fc-urteen persons and seventeen Repub
lican ballots by six persons. The ad
ditional charge was filed against the
accused that they stuffed the ballot
box. No evidence was offered in their
defense, but their attorney, John Q.
Taylor, declared in his argument that
the Supreme Court watchers were
equally as guilty as his clients.
District Judge John I. Mullins Im
paneled a Grand Jury In the Criminal
Court to-day and will to-morrow de
liver his instructions to them in re
gard to investigating election frauds.
Judge Mullins questioned the jurors
particularly with reference to their
connection with corporations or bank
ing Institutions and from this it is in
ferred that he will instruct them to
make special inquiry concerning large
campaign contributions and the uses to
which they were put.
Before United States Commissioner
Capron to-day was begun the hearing
of the second lot of officials charged
with conspiracy to intimidate voters.
The defendants are: Max and William
Schradsky, Max Sissack, Sam Slatkin
and Sadie Pleusner, Democratic work
ers and officials. The complaining wit
ness, Rose Snyder, a Republican pre
cinct committee woman, testified that
she made attempts to vote during the
forenoon, but each time she was pre
vented.
Other 'witnesses testified to the
same facts, one adding: that a woman
worker was so badly beaten by men,
who were handling the Democratic
end of the precinct work, that she
was unable to leave her bed for a
week following. The trend of the tes
timony was that Schradsky ran af
fairs at this polling-place with a high
hand.
Girl Takes Strychnine.
SAX LUIS OBISPO. Dec. 5. â Mary
Cordero, a young woman from Ven

Hotel, in this city, yesterday after
noon by swallowing ten grains of
strychnine. The deed was witnessed ;
by Antonio Pena, and doctors were :
hastily summoned, but the young
woman resisted treatment and died in
half an hour.
PROFESSOR STEPHENS LECTURES â
Professor H. Morse Stephens of the University
of California delivered the fifth of a series of
lectures last night at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
The subject of the talk was "France, the
First Wars of the Empire."
Cleanse the stomach and restore and
tone it up by using Lash's Bitters. *C
the most part sat impassive through
out the speech, though he did now and
then' bite his finger tips restlessly or
nervously smooth his hair, replied to S
Bebel. j
The Chancellor agreed with Hexr Be- ,
â¢bel in the statement that if a great â 
European war breaks out the socialists
will profit thereby, adding:
"There is further reason why the
Governments of all the great powers j
are maintaining their present peace '
policy." '
Referring to Herr Bebel's description ;
of the internal conditions of Russia, ;
Count von Bulow remarked: I
"When Herr . Bebel thus warms up '
over Russian autocracy he condemns
himself without knowing it, for the !
manner in which he lords it over his '
own party corresponds with the Rus
sian conditions that so displease him.
The order of things he wants to intro
duce with us would lay Russian despo
tism in the shade."
Taking up the case, of the German
fishing vessel Sonntagi fired on by one
of the warships of the Russian Baltic
squadron, and other incidents. Chan
cellor von Bulow said the German
Government promptly took steps to get
satisfaction and all Justifiable demands
â were immediately met without diffi
culty.
Discussing the anti-German feeling
in Great Britain, Count von Bulow re
iterated that the purpose of the Ger

ARBITRATION TREATIES
PASS RESOLUTIONS AT BIG MEETING
At Temple Emanu-E!, Suttcr street,
near Stockton, advocates of peace on
earth gathered last evening to lend
their moral support to the great move
ment that has been inaugurated by the
7'nited States for international arbi
tration. The meeting was called
by the Pacific Coast branch of the
American Conference on International
Arbitration, and the call was answered
by hundreds of California's most distin
guished citizens.
Some of the foremost thinkers of the
roast were chosen to expound for the
audience the humanitarian philosophy
upon which the American statesmen
are proceeding toward their goal, and
for two hours they held the undivided
attention of all. In the absence of
Governor Pardee, who is ill. Chief Jus
tice Beatty of the State Supreme Court
presided and introduced as speakers

ble with my back, and latterly it
ached all the time. I dreaded to
stoop on account of the acute twinges
which shot across my loins when I
attempted to straighten, and many a
time I was compelled to place my
hands on the small of my back and
press them into my loins for the
.slight assistance that makeshift af-
forded. T>vo boxes of Doan's Kid-

positively removed other symptoms

slty of California. The object of the
meeting was first explained by Judge
Morrow.
RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED.
The other speakers followed, and then
resolutions, introduced by Mr. Lane,
expressing the views of the meeting:,
were unanimously adopted. The resolu
tions follow: .
â Whereas, the Government of the United
States has sanctioned the principle of interna
tional arbitration by frequent resort to it In
Its controvereies with other nations and by
joining with the civilized world in the creation
of th* permanent court of arbitration at The
Ha<m*: and
Whereas, treaties have been and are soon to
be negotiated by the United States with sig
natory powers of The Hague convÂ«ntlon, by
which submission of certain classes of dis
putes to The Hague tribunal is made obliga
tor}' upon the contracting parties; therefore,
be it
Resolved, by the citizens of California in
general mass meeting assembled. That It Is cur
profound conviction that an appeal to arbitra
tion in all controversies which mar fall of
diplomatic adjustment is the only humane and
rational method of settlement for civilized na
t'.T.j; and that to this end we view with great
satisfaction any action which will extend that
principle and thus secure the benefits arising
from the constantly enlarging political and
commercial relations of the world; and b* It
further
Resolved. That we view with unqualified ap
proval the negotiation of treaties by the
United States with other powers, which make
obligatory a submission to Th* Hague tribunal
of controversies between them, and we ear
nestly appeal to the Senators from the State
of California to use their influence In securing
the prompt approval of such treaties by the
United Etates Senate; and be It further
Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be
forthwith forwarded to the President of the
United States, to, the Senators from the State
of California, to the president of th* United
States Senete and to the chairman of the Sen
ate Committee on Forelen Relations.
TO STIMULATE SEX ATE.
In stating the object of the meet
ing Judge Morrow said that It was
the desire of the American people to !
stimulate i the United Slates Senate to
immediate action in ratifying the arbi
tration treaties with various foreign
Governments that had been 'drafted
by Secretary Hay.
"The coming session of Congress is '
short," said Judge Morrow, "and we
do not want this great question to
stand in abeyance longer than is abso
lutely necessary. During the week
there will be meetings in many of the
large Eastern cities to urge that . im
mediate action be taken on tftese
treaties. Looking out as we do on the
sea that sweeps the Orient we should
have a voice in this question and we
are here to-night to do what we can
to aid the movement to secure last
ing peace among the peoples of the
earth."
The Rev. Mr. Leavitt said that the
condition for which the world had
hoped for and despaired of was at
last near at hand.' Five hundred years
before Christ, he continued, the He
brew philosophers thought the time
for the end of war had come, but to
day finds men fighting more bravely
! and more scientifically than ever be
fore in the history of man. A thing
that made the present war in the
Orient, he concluded, stand out' most
strikingly was that the Czar, led astray
by the wiles of wicked advisers, failed
to make use of the tribunal he him
self established at The Hague. Never
theless he said, when war is replaced
with peaceful but not less virile and
stimulating occupations, it will ' be
swept aside and" men will dwell In
everlasting peace.
WAR OUT OF DATE.
President Benjamin - Ide Wheeler
said that the movement undertaken
by the United States was certain of
great results, not only because war
was out of date and waskilling itself
off. but because the words of ; John
Hay. carried more weight than those
of any statesman in Europe and ' be
cause In . his i magnificent ,navy 4 Uncle
Sam had the -"big stick" . with ; which
to support' his theories; there. being no
better insurer of peace than prepared
ness for war.' I ' .

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, TUESDAY; DECEMBER 6, 1904.
"THE SENATOR"
A DEAD PLAY
Clever Company at Majestic
Does the Best It Can to
Put Life Into the Piece
SCENERY IS HANDSOME
Audience Shows Its Pleasure
at Meeting the Old Favorite
in the New Playhouse
"The Senator" lacks only a ragtime
setting and a cast containing Williams
and Walker really ' to amuse. The
Majestic company did their best with
the play last night, something on those
lines. It was the only thing to Ao.
They had revived the play, and seeing
it one wondered why. They seemed
rather to wonder themselves. But,
like the clever and conscientious folk
they are, they decided to make the best
of it.
As will be remembered by some, "The
Senator" is a play of American political
life and manners, that was used with
considerable success years ago by W.
H. Crane. Its hero is a brusque, ener
getic. Western politician, who sends
word to the President "to wait, as he
hasn't time to see him now," and gen
erally runs Washington in our happy
Western way. Its heroine is a nice lit
tle girl in a black frock, who, is teach
ing piano and cheering up grandpapa,
who has been living in hope for ninety
years or so of the recognition of a val
uable claim against the Government.
The Senator falls in love with the girl
and takes ud the - claim. A ' musical
comedy villain who wapts an embas
sadorship in Bolivia; another, an Aus
trian diplomat, who is" very, catholicâ
and notably careless for a diplomatâ in
his love affairs; the Secretary of State
â nothing small, you know; a widow of
marital inclinations, and a sort of Ber-
stant internecine strife in South Amer
ica and pointed to the great good in
ternational arbitration would do to
these small nations that periodically
bleed themselves to death in purpose
less wars. In conclusion he support
ed President Wheeler's "big stick"
theory and gave as his view that the
offensive and defensive strength of
this nation will greatly aid it in its
campaign for peace.
Rabbi Voorsanger drew a striking
picture of what he believed would be
the last war on earth â a war, per
haps, in which the United States and
England, side by side, may battle with
the powers of the world to compel
them to submit to the ways of peace
and to throw their destinies into the
hands of a tribunal that shall hence
forth deal out Justice to the weak as
well as the strong. In conclusion he
said that before this peace can come,
however, nations, as individuals,, must
first learn the secret of self-control
and when this is done even the courts
of arbitration will find but small em
ployment.
TERRIBLE COST OF WAR.
The Rev. Mr. Brown spoke on the
business view of war; told of its ter
rible cost in human lives and gold and
said that from any standpoint it did
not pay. A better way to settle dis
putes of the nations must be found, he
said, and in the idea of arbitration it
had been found and when agreed to by
all nations it would be to the honor
and glory of God and to the credit of
all His people.
The question of war once settled, said
Mr. Lane, the nations of the earth
could turn their attention to questions
more directly bearing upon the hap
piness of their people. It would mean
that time could be given to the prob
lem of the congested city and the de
serted farm, to the growing disrespect
for law and to the settling of the trou
bles that are arraying class against
class and that are threatening even the
stability of the institutions of this free
nation.
But he said he had no fear that these
problems would not be met before it
was too late. When they were met it
could be said that at last the world was
at peace and that .the justice of law
had forever displaced the right that
comes with the might of the sword.

SEAMEN OF AMERICA CONVENE
NINTH ANNUAL : SESSION
Delegates From All Parts of Country
Are-Present at the Opening.
The Seamen's Union of America
opened : its ninth annual ' convention
yesterday morning. at. Eagles'. Hall, 731
Market street. Delegates from the At
lantic' States,- the Great Lakes and Pa
cific Coast were "present.'. '_. Many who
had -not arrived yesterday will be on
hand this morning.': V.
The convention was called to order at
10 'o'clock by President W.Penje of
Chicago. He got a cordial reception as
he ' took." the platform.*' He '. introduced
Walter Macarthur, editor of the Coast
Seamen's Journal, who made, the open
ing address and extended a sincere
welcome to the visiting delegates on
behalf of the local district.
The convention got its books and re
ports in order for the commencement
of' business. The;, committees were
named and the reports of the president,
treasurer and secretary were read. Re
ports of the organizing and. legislative
committees and also the reports of the
members of this organization who were
delegates to the recent convention of
the American Federation of Labor were
read and referred to the committees. A
report from the committee on rules rec
ommending that assistance be given
the licensed mates of the Great Lakes
in organizing a union was unanimously
adopted.
An open meeting under the auspices
of the Seamen's Union of America will
be held Saturday, evening at Sailors'
Union Hall, East and Mission streets.
The meeting is to give all* the seamen
in port a chance to meet the visiting
delegates and discuss the conditions of
their organization. ' Many prominent
tie the lamb lieutenant are among the
more important people.
It is comforting to think that to-mor
row will not depend upon "The Sena
tor" for a picture of American life. For
the play is already dead. It Is old
fashioned in the worst Bense of . the
word, with its asides, generally naive
construction, and prevailing air of un
reality. The politics are as convincing
as the financial flights of Kolb and DHL
The social habits of Washington, as
here exhibited, are even more brilliant
ly incredible. Then the fact that some
of the people are badly cast . does . not
conduce to illusion. Mr. Gould, much
be'tter fitted to the stuttering lieuten
ant's role, plays the Senator.- Mr. Gll
mour, j who should have been" playing
the Senator, is essaying the lieutenant
role. John.D. O'Hara again is a.con
vincing grandfather, and Robert Elliott
fairly good as the Austrian diplomat;
Harry Mestayer, George Woodward â
but why continue? -And to think of
these people in their admirable per
formance of "When We Were Twenty-
One!"
Miss Eleanor. Gordon appears as the
heroine,' and. ls : Blmple and engaging in
the part." Adele Block is cast as the
widow, and does her best with sumptu
ous gowns to blind one to the weakness
of the role,, and Elsie Esmond : figures
prettily as the ingenue. "But none of
the parts are played with full convic
tion, and there is no particular reason
to see "The Senator." The piece is very
handsomely staged, however, and the
audience seemed to get plenty of
amusement out of it.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Columbia.
The third and final week of Maxine
Elliott's engagement is now on at the
Columbia Theater, where her fine
production of "Her Own Way" has
been witnessed and enjoyed by some
very large houses. Seat sale for the
remaining five nights and Saturday
matinee is very large, and the de
lightful Clyde Fitch play will be
seÂ«:n by great numbers up to and in
cluding Saturday night, when the
final presentation takes place. There
will be a matinee Saturday. Next
Sunday night comes "A Chinese
Honeymoon."
Alcazar.
The three-act comedy, "The Pro
fessor's Love Story." began the week
last, night at the Alcazar. .It was
presented by the clever company most
acceptably to a highly gratified au
dience. The fun' of the comedy
limps somewhat in the first act and
trcts along nimbly in the second, but
the pathos, the humanity and the hu
mor are climaxed together In . the
third, and the curtain falls to con
tinued applause. , Mr. Craig has no
easy role in that of the absent-minded
Professor . Goodwillie, and adroitly
keeps back from that dangerous line
where eccentricity develops 'into .the
ridiculous. Much dry Scotch humor
Is there in the Pete and Henders of
Harry " Hilliard and John B. Maher,
respectively, the hot and. cold suitors
for the hand , of Effle Proctor, â¢ which
character, in dialect and action, was
well portrayed by Laura Adams.
Lillian Lawrence is the. heroine. Lucy
"White, and plays the part with her
usual fidelity and thoroughness.
Adele Belgarde and Elizabeth "Wood
son are cast in congenial roles, .and
share the applause with the heroine.
George Osbourne treats the audience
to a good bit of character In the part
of Dr. Cozens.
Central.
Race horses, jockeys, plenty of fun
and a well defined plot characterized
the excellent production of "The
Suburban" at the Central Theater last
night. This is the first time the great
melodrama has ever been seen in this
city .after having toured the , East for
several seasons. Ethel Clifton and Her
schel Mayall were as usual happily cast
and both were well received. .Mr..May
all is unconventional and does some of
his best work 'as -Donald. Gordon, th#
rich Scotchman's son. Henry. Schumer
gave' an exceptional fine performance
of a difficult Sir â  Ralph Gordon. James
Corrigan was . hilariously : funny; as the
honest German. .Ernest Howell as the
malicious old servant was unpleasant
ly cast -but treated the part in -his fin
ished manner and scored ;a\ hit. The
other members of the company were
seen to advantage. \

HEIRS FIGHT
OVER ESTATES
Mrs. Nelson Bump and Step
daughters Make Things
Generally Uncomfortable
TAKE FBOM EACH OTHER
Two-Year-Old Grandson of
Adeline 31. Sayle Wins
Out Against His Aunts
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Dec. 6.
Fuel was added to the flght between
the widow of the late Nelson Bump
and her four stepdaughters over the
property left by the real estate man,
when, through their attorneys, the lat
ter attempted this morning to have
the allowance of $125 a month
granted Mrs. Bump out of the estate
cut down to $20. While Judge Hall
reduced It to $100 a month, Mrs.
Bump succeeded in having the|rent of
property on Merritt Island, now un
der lease to H. S. Ivey. the husband of
one of the daughters, increased from
$2200 to $3000.
Bump married a second time late in
life and when he died left an estate,
valued at between $50,000 and
$75,000, almost entirely to his four
daughters, Mrs. Sarah A. Dean, Mre.
Lydia Thomas, Mrs. Ellen McFadden
and Mrs. Annie Ivey. The widow re
ceived a bequest of $2000 and a house,
valued at $2500. Acontest was Im
mediately begun by the widow, who
alleges that her late husband was in
fluenced by his daughters. Pending
the action she was granted an allow
ance from the estate.
By a ruling by Judge Ogden to
day in the estate of the late Adeline
M. Sayle Mrs. Helen E. Pearce and
Mrs. Luelen T. Gardner may only in
herit the interest from a $6000 estate
left by deceased, while the principal
must go to the testatrix's grandson,
Gutherie Courvoisier. a child 2 years
cf age. The will contained a trust
clause providing that the trustee,' in
his discretion, might give the benefi
ciaries the income or convey the prop
erty to them entirely. The grandson
was made the residuary legatee in case
sny of the property remained after the
death of the legatee.
Judge Ogden held that the trust
part of the will giving the trustee the
right to deed the property came un
der the rule in the Fair will case and
was invalid. Thft leaves the will
stand, so far as the interest for life
gees, but gives the principal to the
grandson at the death of his aunts.

PROPOSED HOSPITAL SITE

of Tidal Canal Ground to At

Council to-night heard protests from
residents and property owners of
Fruitvale Sanitary District No. 2
against the location of the City Hos
pital for contagious diseases on the

deeded to the city by the Realty Syn
dicate. A. L. Cohen, J. H. Richard
son. J. H. W. Riley and E.' H. Marwe-
del made speeches in support of the
protost. The opposition to the site

idents or taxpayers. The question was
referred to City Attorney McElroy for
an opinion.

ADVE^TISÂ£aiÂ£yrs.
FOR TWENTY YEARS.
Not an Unusual Instance.
"I used Pyramid Pile Cure and have ,
not had any trouble since. I have been
a sufferer with piles for twenty years.
I think it is the best remedy on earth
for piles. Hoping this may help
others /to use this remedy." Mrs. J.
D. Teller. R. F. D. 20, Sparta, Mich.:
It is a singular fact that although
many women suffer from piles, or
hemorrhoids, they frequently do not
have proper treatment because of a
delicacy women have in mentioning
such a subject. Especially is this the
case with those who have no hus-
band or brother in whom they can
eonflde; and a physician is seldom
consulted until the pain and agony in-
cident to piles become unbearable.
Thousands of women have suffered
even longer than did Mrs. Teller, al-
ways^experiencing slight or temporary
relief, if any, from the various reme-
dies used and finally settling down to
the conviction that a cure in their
cases was impossible.-. Pyramid Pile
Cure has come as a boon to all such,
as it seldom. If ever, 'fails to effect a
permanent cure. It Is sold by drug-
gists for 50 cents a package, or will
be mailed by the makers to any ' ad-
dress upon receipt of price. Absolute
secrecy is guaranteed and no name is
ever used without the consent of the
writer.
It is suggested that those interested
write to Pyramid Drug. Co., -Marshall,'
Mich., for their little book describing
the causes and cure of piles, as it is
cent free for the asking.-'"
GIVES UP LIFE
FOR ONE DUCK
Hunter Brendon Clark Dies
From Exposure in "Blind"
at Mount Eden Preserves
INQUEST SHOWS FACTS
Coroner Finds That Chill
and Dampness Brought on
Suddenly Fatal Illness
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 6.
Brendon Clark, the San Francisco
theatrical man, whose body was found
at the West End Club's preserves, near
Mount Eden, Friday by his hunting
companion, Frank W. Treat, lost his
life for one duck. Exposure that
caused congestion of the lungs and
paralysis of the heart ended the young
man's existence. For nine hours ' he
had kept vigil on the duck ponds. The
chilly air and dampness affected his
lungs. '
Such were the facts disclosed to-day
at the Inquest, held at Hay wards by
Coroner Mehrmann. Dr. O. G. Rey
nolds gave testimony concerning
Clark's physical condition, which ex
plained and cleared the mystery that
had surrounded the death.
Treat told how Clark and himself
had begun their hunt at 6 o'clock Fri
day morning. A few hours later they
met again for breakfast and after that
separated until S o'clock. Treat went
to Clark's "blind" to rejoin him, but
fcund his friend's body in the water.
He dragged the corpse out, but could
not imagine what had caused death.
Clark had stayed at his post anxious
to make a killing and had caught the
severe chill. His bag consisted of only
the one duck that Was found in his
"blind."
The Coroner's Jury returned a ver
dict in accordance with the evidence.

and childhood and a sympathetic interpreter

REMARKABLE FEATS
OF FIXING IN 'MIND
London Youth of Long Ago AVho;Re
membered All He Had :
- Rend. .
The London Times recently pub
lished an extract from its columns of
a century ago, In which were related
the remarkable feats of memory per
formed by T. P. Oldfleld, who died
at Grotto House, Margate, in! the six
teenth year of his age. The extract
reads:
"At the age of 5 years 6 months he
had scarlet fever, which brought' on
him paralysis of # the lower extremities
and debilitated his body for the rest of
his life, but his mind presented the
finest display of human perfection.
"Whatever he read he instantly had
by heart; his favorite pursuits were
the mathematics, philosophy, astron
omy, geography, history and painting,
In all of which he made a great pro
ficiency. His favorite authors were
Locke and Newton and his retentive
faculties were so strong that he never
forgot a single incident with which he
had been once acquainted. ,. -A
"He could relate every circumstance
of Grecian,. Roman and English his
tory; was master of astronomy and
had' pursued it up to all Its recent dis
coveries; had the finest taste for draw
ing and painting and would frequently
take admirable likenesses of persons
who struck him from memory. He
wrote a hand like copper plate and at
a very early period in life had made
himself master of arithmetic.
"He was never known to be out of
temper, and though he suffered an ill
ness of ten years, which terminated in
a dropsy and bursting of a blood ves
sel upon the lungs, he" was never
once known to repine or be impatient.
His wit was brilliant and refined and
his loss will ever be regretted by those
who had the happiness to know him."

Alameda City Trustees Pass
Law to Stop Hauling In
of Waste From Oakland
FORM HOSE COMPANIES
Will Replace Volunteers
Who Recently Withdrew
From Service of the City
ALAMEDA. Dec. 6. â The City Trus
tees to-night passed an ordinance pro
hibiting the dumping of outside garb
age within the municipal limits. The
measure was enacted at the request of
many residents of the east end, who
objected to Oakland scavengers dump
ing waste and filth from that city
along the Bay Farm Island road.
E. T. Probst, L. x C. Lenz. Henry
Rieschrath and E. O. Bishop were ap
pointed members of Hose No. 2, for
merly Whidden Hose Company of the
volunteer department. Walter Stern
metz, Sam Josephs, Howard Simpson
and George Wulzen were appointed
members of Hose No. 3, formerly
Sherman Hose Company.
THE BIBLE PRINTED
,IN MANY TONGUES
Translated Into Four Hundred and
Fifty Language* â Enormous
'â¢> ' : J - Circulation.
Three hundred million copies of the
Bible have been printed in a century.
The British and American Bible so
cieties circulate some 8,000.000 copies
a year. Forty per cent of the cost la
recovered from sales.
Often the payments are made in
curious substitutes for money, such as
cowry shells in Uganda, copra and
arrowroot | in New Hebrides, swords,
daggers, sandals, amulets, straw hats,
pieces of silk, eggs, butter, rotten
cheese, dogs' teeth, sea birds' eggs and
other picturesque circulating material.
Occasionally, even. Bibles are stolen.
Something like 2000 colporteurs and
Bible women travel in all manner of
outlandish places, "by railroad, car
riage, boat, bullock, wagon, sleigh,
bicycle, wheelbarrow, on mule, Jin
rikisha or afoot," to distribute Bibles.
Bibles must be packed in water
tight parcels to be landed through the
surf in Madras; they are made up in
fifty-six pound packages to' fit coolies'
backs in Annam.
A century ago the Bible was printed
in forty languages. It is now printed
In 450, and new ones are being added
every. year. "Sometimes languages are
practically made by the Bibleâ that Is
to say. It is the first book printed In
some obscure tongue, so rude that it
does not even contain words enough
to express thought.
Take, for example thÂ£ translation
Just matle' Â¥or*the Sheetswa r tribe : in
East Africa. 1, They, had no word .for
Supreme Being*., t or . home, father,
heaven, h6usÂ« and other ideas equally
fundamental. Qther .recent tran'sla*
tions have "been Into -Mare, Persian.
Uganda, Labrador-Eskimo, Kongo-
Baldo. Wedan, TFarig,. Madarese and
Nogugu. ..'â¢:, â¢
And there are said to be on the
borders of the Indian empire 108
languages in which there is.no Chris
tian scripture printed.â Century.
Settled Society In Kansas.
â¢ After the war a" Boston man was
stopping at the Planters' House, the
principal hotel of Leavenworth, and
coming down to breakfast* late one
morning: ho partook of that meal with
the landlord.
"Well, Mr. â :," said the landlord,
"how do you like our Western coun
try?"
"I like it very well." said the Bos
ton man, "or would If society here were
in a more settled state."
"Nonsense," said the landlord, "our
society Is as settled as that of Bos
ton."
Just then Anthony burst Into the din
ing-room and out of a back door, with
Jennlson pumping lead at .every Jump,
and following him out into the out
buildings in the rear of the hotel.
"How about society being as settled
here as Boston?" said the Boston man
as he and the landlord crawled out
from under opposite sides of the table.
"I had forgotten about that Anthony-
Jennison matter." said the landlord,
"but If Doc Jennison has caught up
with Anthony that Is settled by this
time." â Boston. Herald.
Physical Beauty Paramount.
. The late John Hollingshead, noted
in London as journalist, magazine
writer and theatrical manager, espe
cially in the last named capacity, had
notions of his own as to what consti
tuted attractions for the stage. For
instance, he bluntly maintained that
the selection of all ladies on the stage,
except for the chorus singers, where
vocal accomplishments were para
mount, should be governed by the de
sire to put pleasing forms and facas
before the public. His view of the
stage was that, however it might be
judged from. lofty heights, it was not
a . platform for the exhibition of
grandmothers and maiden aunts. If
-physical beauty could be got with
brains and talent, so much the better.
The first choice was physical beauty.
Wonderful Excavation Work
One of the greatest pieces of excavat
ing ever attempted for a building in
New York is being done - for the new-
Pennsylvania Railroad depot between
Thirty-first and â  Thirty-third streets
and Eighth and Ninth avenues. Two
large steam shovels are doing the dig
ging, and 125 teams, of two horses each;
cart the dirt away as fast as It can
be scooped up. The steam shovels run
the entire length*of the block, digging
their way as they go, very much like
a farmer plowing a furrow. "Alongside
the furrow is a string of carts waiting
to be loaded. Each cart moves prompts
ly v forward, as. the front cart is filled;
and the shovels work, so . fast that
the line is constantly on the move. â

Big Canadian Elevator.
The Canadian Government has re
tained a grain elevator engineer to
prepare plans and specifications for
the : large grain:" elevator to be built at
Port Colburn. the Lake Erie entrance
to the Welland canal, which will be
an adjunct to the canal system. The
transportation commission recently
recommended that an elevator be built
at this point for the purpose of trans
ferring grain from the large lake ves
sels, which carry cargoes of 150 000
to.260.000 bushels,' to- canal-size ves
sels or barges, which will then trans
port it through the Welland, Lake On
tario and St. Lawrence canals to Mon
treal." â New. York Commercial. â  *

FAIR INVOLVED
IN A SCANDAL
St. LOUIS. Dec. Â£.â In a letter to
Major J. G. Pangborn, president of
the United Exhibitors' Association,
made public to-day. President Thomas
H. Carter of the Xational World's
Fair Commission, declared that
"most ;rrave and serious charges of
corruption in connection with the
awarding of certain premiums have
been filed" with the National Com
mission.
The letter, after quoting that part
of the act of Congress making: an ap
propriation for the exposition, which
provide? "that the appointment of
ail judges and examiners for the ex
position and the awarding of pre
miums, if any, shall be done and per
formed by the exposition company,
subject, however, to the National
Commission, created by section 2 of
this act." continues as follows:
Vnder the rules adopted by the company
and approved by the commission the group
of jurcre were to be appointed by thÂ» com
pany before August 1, lÂ»04. None of the
Jurors was submitted to the commission for
approval In accordance with this provision of
U>e rules and regulations. A number of those
who acted were not submitted to the com
mission for approval until after they had
performed their functions and departed from

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER: 6. 1904.
ACTOR'S SENSE OF PROPRIETY
IMPELS HIM TO SMITE ARTIST
PREVENTS A- SNAPSHOT OF , SOUBRETTE
Prostrate and Unconscious, Neither Her, Attitude Nor Her
- Costume Made Her Fit for Photography.
Several members of "The Runaways"
company Baid in the presence of Police
Judge Conlan that the battering of a
newspaper photographer by Charles
Dox, an elongated comedian, was an
act to be commended instead of re
proved, inasmuch as the assailed one
had insisted on snapshooting: a sou
brptte whose pose and apparel should
have sufficed to restrain any decent
person from attempting such marks
manship. She had swooned and was
prostrate, the witnesses testified, and
her skirt was abbreviated to an extent
that exposed more hosiery than a
proper minded member of the opposite
sex would gaze at any longer than he
could possibly avoid. To photograph
such a display would be simply an out
rage; and its prevention by Mr. Dox
was a tribute to that gentleman's gal
lantry rather than provocative of his
punishment by fine or imprisonment.
Yes, It was true 'that the young lady
In question had exhibited her nether
limbs, encased in silken tights, on many
American stages and before large and
admiring audiences, nor would it be
gainsaid that her physical grace as de
picted on the billboards had interested
art-loving millions in the United States
and Canada: but the court should un
derstand that in the profession of which
she is an esteemed member it is con
sidered one thing to have your portrait
exploited after you have voluntarily
stood for it, and an entirely different
thing to be portrayed when you're not
looking.
Of such was the substance of the de
fense. The battery occurred on the
stage of the California Theater the
night of November 26, and the prosecu
tion alleges that the complaining wit
ness was summoned to the playhouse
by' one of the attaches and had the
manager's permission to go behind the
scenes with his camera. It was not be
cause his sense of modesty was shocked
that Mr. Dox smote the complainant,
the latter averred, but because he was
piqued, by the complainant's refusal to
photograph the lady who had fainted
and advertise "The Runaways" by pub
lishing the picture.
During the examination of Arthur
Dunn, a diminutive comedian, whose
physical foil Mr. Dox lÂ« in the play, he
was asked if he was an actor, and he
replied that some people seemed to
think he was.
"Does everybody think you are?" in
quired the attorney.
"Well." said the little man, "the peo
ple of San Francisco did not seem to
think so."
All the masculine mummers wore
long- overcoats, and all the ladies of the
company â singing and dancing sou-
CANNOT FIND
THE DIAMONDS
What has E. A. Read, dealer in jewel
ry on the instalment plan, done with
more than $10,000 worth of diamonds
which he bought on credit? That is
what four wholesale jewelry merchants
want to know. Read is at the City
Prison on a charge of concealing goods
with the intent of defrauding credit
ors. The diamonds cannot be located.
In May Read opened an" office in the
Crocker building. He was advanced
$10,000 worth of jewelry, mostly dia
monds, by four firms. The creditors
are the California Jewelry Company,
A. S. Eisenbers & Co.. George Desen
fant and J. Nufmacher. When Read
had been in business several months
without making any returns the firms
became anxious and put detectives on
his trail. They got out an attachment
on Read's stock, but nothing was found
in his office but a desk, a typewriter
and less than $1000 worth of stock. The
books showed no records of sales. Read
explained that he sold the jewelry but
had lost the money gambling at the
racetrack and playing poker. His cred-^
itors do not believe him. Read told
them that he had made some sales of
diamonds at the Oakland -racetrack
four months ago. The track was closed
at that time. They believe that Read
has cached the diamonds, and have en
gaged Attorneys Schleslnger and
Humphries to prosecute the case.
<"It was resorted to the creditors by
one of the Plnkertons, who shadowed
the suspicious man, that Read was seen
to pass a sealed package to a man In
Jefferson square just prior to his arrest.
Read's bail is nxed at 52500. He ad
mltted having obtained the Jewelry, but
says he sold it and lost the money
gambling. He says he made partial re
turns for the diamonds. Read is said
to have a fiancee in Fruitvale. ' '

saucy "broilers" â wore their 'Jroad"
wraps. The scene was somewhat sug
gestive of a railway, depot waiting-room
when a "troupe" is departing.
Harry Craig, whose appearance pro
nounced him old enough to know bet
ter,-brought shame upon his respectable
parents by stealing a fireman's coat,
with badge attached, from an engine
house in the Mission and strutting
around displaying the nickel-plated
shield and falsely representing himself
to be. a duly qualified fighter of flames.
His. life yearning was to be a â¢"laddie,"
but his family had higher alms for him
and declined to encourage his ambi
tion, . so he committed the larceny.
Judge Fritz has his case under consid
eration.
John W. Harding declared he did not
regret, his disturbance of. the peace at
the Jockeys' ball, nor did he believe it
merited punishment by. law. Two -young
women, a blonde and a brunette, were
under his protection at the festivity,
he explained, and it *?as in resentment
of what he considered an undue affront
to one of them that he provoked'ar

further elucidated^ to Judge Mogan.

Mr. Harding's dismissal was immedi
ately followed by the arraignment of
Peter Thomas, also charged with hav
ing failed to observe, the decorum in
sisted on by the directors of the
Jockeys' ball. No redeeming phase cf
chivalry, however, was urged in ex
tenuation of Mr. Thomas' transgres
sion. Instead of championing a dis
tressed female, he verbally abused the
lady whose "steady" he was. In his
behalf it was pleaded that her behavior
was such as to convey to him great
vexation of spirit. After the first dance
she seemed so eager to avoid a repeti
tion with him as her partner that he
accused her of deliberate coquetry. She
denied the impeachment and requested
him to try to: abstain from being hog
gish and to allot/ her to trip the light
fantastic with whom she pleased. He
retorted by saying that if he were an
inferior dancer he could "find logical
reason for 'her desire to whirl with
others, but as his Terpsichorean ability
was unquestioned he could only ascribe
her conduct to an innate love of flirta
tion. At which she tossed her head,
clutched her train and swung into a
two-step in the embrace of an eighty
seven-pound jockey who could scarce
ly dance at all. Thus it went, the lady
whirling with a different partner
through every number on the card,
while he who had imagined himself her
physical escort and intellectual dicta
tor, sat amid the wall-flowers and
gloomed, until "Home, Sweet Home,"
brought the function to a close. Then
he invaded the masculine circle of
which she was an admired center and
proffered to lead her to the cloak room
but she kept him waiting in humilia
tion until the last of her adorers had
bidden her good night. His chagrin
was kept in subjection, however, until
she postponed her departure at the re
quest of several weazened riders of
race horses who unanimously proposed
that she Join them at table and partake
of wine. No sooner was she comforta-
MORE TIME
ASKED FOR
BY WEBER
Special Dispatch to The Call
AUBUUX. Dec. 5.â When Adolph
Weber appeared in court this morning
to plead to the charge of murdering
his mother. Mary Weber, the court
room was crowded.
Pale-faced, but with no lack of the
steadiness that- has marked his every
move since his arrest on the awful
charge of killing his entire family,
Weber gave the crowd a contemptuous
look and then coolly took his seat be
side his attorney. When the case of
the "People versus Adolph Weber"
was called he raised his head and
smiled. Evidently the general words
affected him but little, and he smiled
again, this time derisively at the spec
tators craned their necks' and pricked
their ears as his attorney arose.
* The crowd was disappointed, and
Weber knew it would be. The accused
youth did not answer the court's ques
tion: "Do you wish to plead at this
time?"
Instead his attorney made a plea
for more time on the ground that
the transcript of the testimony given
at the. preliminary hearing was not
complete. â ' ".

was promptly arrested, and the last
he saw of the lady she was toasting her
companions in a bumper that sparkled.
"Dafs de trut* of it," said Mr. Thom
as to the Judge, and dismissal ensued.
It was the united opinion of Captain
Spillane land Patrolman Tillman that
Peter Hansen, 70 years of age and
slight of physique, must have been a
world beating: rough and tumble fighter
in his young; â  manhood. For the way
in which he handled the wiry captain
and the herculean Tillman when they
placed him under arrest would have
made James Edward Brit t- stare and
caused "Battling" Nelson to gape if
either of those stellar exponents of the
art manly had seen the performance.
The fray occurred on Natoma street.
near to Third, /where Mr. Hansen vio
lated the ordinance which prohibits the
depositing of garbage within the city's
boundaries. He appeared to be such
an easy subject to control tliat the of
ficers felt rather ashamed of laying
hands upon his rounded shoulders, but
no sooner did they touch him than
disillusion came. From a seemingly
decrepit and passive prisoner he-sud
denly became the personification of
Berserk strength and rage. Captain
Splllane denies that he was hoisted
higher than the first story of an adja
cent building, and Patrolman Tillman
avers that if he had not been taken
completely by surprlse^he could not
have been tripped uplfy the defendant
or a dozen like him. Each of the peace
guardians disclaimed having at any
time suspected the human tornado ol
being "Young Corbett" in disguise,
but they agreed that a harder tussle
could not have been given them by
that renowned pugilist. From the
time of their first laying on of hands
until they sat, tired and triumphant,
upon their prostrate opponent, exactly
thirty minutes were consumed in ac
tive fighting.
Judge Slogan is awaiting character
testimony In behalf of Mr. Hansen.
Fred Thomas, a discharged soldier,
saw a former comrade in arms playing
a nickel-in-rthe.-slot machine with pain
ful recklessness, and to save the gam
bler from threatening bankruptcy Mr.
Thomas surreptitiously extracted from
one of his pockets a golden double
eerie and substituted therefor a- sil
ver dollar, departing with the more
valuable coin. That's the excuse he
submitted to Judge Conlan, before
whom he was accused of larceny, but
it was. scoffed at and he will answer in
the Superior Court.
BUFFALO BANK
CLOSES DOORS
BUFFALO, N. Y., Dec. 5.â The
German Bank of Buffalo was closed '
to-day by State Superintendent of
Banking Kilburn". because or a "run,"';
which began with the opening of the,
doors and continued to grow in volume '
as the day advanced. A big crowd
of excited depositors gathered in front j
of the German Bank, seeking infor
mation. Officers were placed at the '
door and no one waa allowed to enter. !
All this excitement had the inevitable j
result of sending nervous depositors
hurying to the German- American |
Bank, a kindred institution. |
Soon after the- announcement was j
made that the German Bank had
closed,, the Buffalo Clearing-house As- '
sociation issued a statement that It*
would stand by the German-American J
Bank and meet all demands made
upon it. It was also announced that
President Emery and two of the direc
tors of the German-American. Bank '
had resigned and that their places had [
been taken by three wealthy Buffalo'
men. These two announcements had j
a reassuring effect and several large;
deposits, which, had been withdrawn,
were replaced in the bank. Small.de- ,
pcsitors, however, continued 'to draw J
out. their money and at 3 o'clock near- !
ly 100; persons were in line before â¢ the j
cashier's window. All of them were
paid before ' the bank closed \ for the
day.: \ , - ' I
Superintendent Kilburn is of the
opinion .that the German Bank will
not resume business. In regard. to the
bank's assets, he said: ' - ...
"A great deal of the money is out
on what might be designated as alow
loans. The deposits amount to be
tween'â$5,000,000 and $6,000,000.
About "$3,000,000 of that sum repre
sents business ; that should have been
done with a savings. bank, rather: than
a discount- bank, it being the accounts
of small depositors." â  .

NEW OIL PIPE
LINE PROMISED
Special I>l*patch to The Cx!l
I FRESXO, Dec. 5.â Coallnga expects
to experience a boom when a new
pipe line Is built to a point on the
San Joaquin River. The line Is
planned by a New Jersey corporation,
the Producers' Union Pipe Line Com
! pany, whose agent. Dr. Alexander Dol
| las, has been in the oil fields several
I weeks arranging the preliminaries and
j securing contracts.
It Is .reported that 6,000,000 barrels
have been signed for,. and considerable
more Is promised as soon as the line
has" materialized. ' The understanding
is that a new pipe line will be run to a
point on the San Joaquin from where
the oil can be loaded into vessels and
barges and shipped to San Francisco.
! The length of the line will be approxi
mately 100 miles, and will be at least
eight-Inch pipe, if not a ten-inch. Pre
liminary surveys have already been
made by surveyors.
It Is said that the company was en
abled to sign up so liberally, because
it offered 25 cents per oarrel for fuel
: oil of the same grade as that which is
! being sold for 15 to 20 cents per bar-
I rel to other pipe line companies. This
J is taken to mean that much drilling
j will be done In the fields. When work
on the new line will be commenced

PVBLICATIOX OmCE THIRD AND MARKET 8TREET3, SAN FRANCISCO
TUESDAY DECEMBER 6. 1904
THE UNIONS AND SOCIALISM.
THE large Socialist vote in the labor centers of the country con
tinues to attract attention. The Socialists were in considerable
strength in the recent meeting of the American Federation of
J-abor in this city, and Mr. Gompers claimed that he defeated them
at every turn. Since the adjournment, however, the Socialists claim
that they secured all they wanted in the passage of a resolution re
quiring that all labor organizations open their lodge rooms to lectures
on "the grand struggle for better conditions and higher culture
* ' * * for the enlightenment and advancement of the proletariat."
It is strange that it escaped the attention of Mr. Gompers that
this requirement is cast in the exact terms of Socialism, and that
the system of collectivism and collective bargaining, as against the
right of individual contract, is held by the Socialists as the prelim
inary to their whole programme. A Socialist labor organ in this
State says that the opening of the labor lodge rooms to the Socialist
propaganda will be the means in four years of swinging the great
bulk of organized labor into united political socialistic action, and
that "the sun has set on the day of Gompers and Mitchell,, who have
no other solution. of the differences between capital and labor than
the strike and starvation." â¢
That the Socialists are not reckoning wildly was shown by an
other incident. The Federation rejected the socialistic resolution
condemning the militia, but it did not order the raising of the boy
cott in San Diego against a militia officer which prevents his earning
a living as a punishment for belonging to the National Guard. This
is distinctly a case in which the unions have the theory but the
Socialists have the practice.
Another incident is claimed by the Socialists as strengthening
their side of this great conflict. The Western Federation of Miners
was fellowshipped by the Federation. It is notoriously a socialistic
organization. So the leveling propaganda issues from the meeting
with head high in the air. Mr. Gompers made a speech at Vallejo
in which he said that before union organization the American work
ingman lived in a hovel, but now his condition is superior and his
cry is for more, ever more. To this the Socialists reply that labor
lived in hovels in this country in the Eastern coal mining districts
only, and lives there yet, and has no hope except by the confiscation
and division of capital, as declared in Mr. Jack London's late procla
mation, on which The Call has commented.
All these claims indicate that the Socialist activity has suffered
no relapse. It drives at a definite solution of the issues raised by
the Federation and fastens itself upon the labor unions as the rep
resentatives of class solidarity, loyalty and prejudice, upon wHicIi
the levelcrs depend for final victory.
The trouble seems to be that Mr. Gompers contents himself
with antagonizing the Socialists in the annual meetings of the Fed
eration, but leaves them unopposed in the subordinate unions be
tween time?. In such a war between the House of Want and the
House of Have, instinct strongly leads man toward the party that
promises an equal division of wealth. A new cult in politics must
be expected to avail itself of the strength of existing organization.
It is hardly to be expected that the Socialists will try to enter the
Bankers' Association to control it in the interest of their movement,
or that it will seek strength in a country club or other organization
which is composed of those whose property is to be confiscated.
They naturally spread their theories before those who want what
others have.
The strife in the unions is watched with keen interest, which
promises finally to be greater than that felt in any other of the
phases of unionism. When it comes to such a pass that the Social
ists in the unions dispute Mr. Gompers' statement of the benefits
of mere unionism it will be seen that an acute stage is approaching.
When Mr. Gompers takes means to compel the capitalist, the em
ployer, to give up part of what he considers his own, and socialism
follows crying "make him give up all," it enjoys a distinct advantage,
because it makes a radical and distinct issue.
In its political aspect Mr. Gompers is contending theoretically
for the preservation of representative government and institutions,
and he should be careful to conform practice to theory, as long as
he remains the exponent of the principles he has elected to propagate
and preserve, for his watchful antagonists have shown their mar
velous capacity for taking advantage of any margin between theory
and practice. . -_ _^ ;â .
THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.
A SIGNIFICANT event recently took place in Russia. From
a meeting of representatives of the zemstvos, the district and
provincial assemblies, there was sent up to the Czar a me
morial expressing "the hope that it is the wish of the Emperor to
summon a national assembly." Not only has a meeting with an
avowed programme been suffered to assemble by the Government,
but the unanimous will of that meeting is to find its way to the
autocratic ears of the Little Father. History is in the making at
this moment.
A survey of the constituency and powers of the zemstvos reveals
the significance of this action of their assembled delegates. Spring
ing from the ancient convention of communal government in Russia,
the zemstvo is the representative assembly of the district and prov
ince, in so far as any body of citizens under the domain of the Czar
may be said to be representative. The body is composed of- repre
sentatives elected by the peasantry, the householders in the towns,
and the landed proprietors ; the few shreds of power allowed it are
those of an advisory nature only in the matter of the economical
administration of the district represented. The assembly of the
zemstvos, the unit of government from which the present radical ac
tion comes, draws its membership from the elected members of the
zemstvos themselves and heretofore has had no more shadow of
authority than that delegated to the subsidiary bodies. â¢
With this knowledge of the nature of that convention which
has had the temerity to petition the Czar for representative govern
ment, we are enabled to appreciate the true complexion of the ques
tion now pending imperial disposition. This memorial represents a
direct blow against the bureaucrats and the reactionaries for whom
and by whom the Government of Russia is administered. It comes
from the masses. It voices the ambitions and -desires of a newly
awakened proletariat. The great potential force in the Russian
state, which has remained immobile and yielding since the dawn
of the country's history, now stirs itself and takes accounting of its
strength.
"Bureaucracy promotes religious intolerance," reads a report of
the speeches made in the assembly of zemstvos; "it muzzles the
press and stifles freedom of speech in order to give a spacious ap
pearance of solidity to the structure of the state. The bureaucracy's
efforts to imprison the people's minds inevitably lead to brute force.
We want a free and independent administration of justice as an es
sential safeguard against this constant encroachment upon the life
and liberty of the individual."
. Strong words these, and strange words to issue from the mouth
of any Russian assembly of the people, however shadowy its power.
What answer will be vouchsafed to them by the jealous Czar is not
difficult to foretell. The significant fact is that they are spoken,
and, fruitless as their mission may be, the spirit that phrased them
still remainsâ a spirit portentous and gravely threatening for the
future of the despotism which rules the puppet Czar.
For some time trolley cars have been running: out from Cairo to the Pyra
mids and we have become hardened to hearing the station agent at Joppa
shout: "All aboard for Jerusalem!" So perhaps we should receive with stoic
ism the news that the City Council of Venice has bought several electric
launches for use on the Grand Canal. Did not the Pope the other day remark
that If he were a little younger he would buy a bicycle, and r is not a London
comuany threatening to set up stamp mills at King Solomon's mines? New

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6r 1904.
THREE ROSES
AND ANOTHER
DR. JOHN DUNHAM knew what
he did not want. He could also
Instantly recognize, what he did
want when he saw It. These
traits had been of use to him in
working his way through col.
lege, through medical school after that,
and into a flourishing practice now two
years old.
In love, as In business, it was the
same, only the girls he had thus far
met were undoubtedly the ones he did
not want. Dr. John's black-gray eyes
were always on the silent quest of an
unknown girl, the thought of whom he
linked with the thought of roses. She
did not appear. He was 32, and begin
ning to think he had missed her. and
was deciding to devote his spare time
entirely to rose culture, when the no
longer-expected happened.
In September, he went with a col
league, Frederick Mayne* M. D., to a
medical convention in St. Louis. Seat
ed at the formal banquet, he looked up,
Just across the table, at her! And then
he seemed to have always known that
she was small and blonde, \wlth the
sweet delicacy, of a pink tea rose; that
her head was poised like a flower, and
that breeding and courage showed in
every feature and gesture.
Instantly the thought of her as his
mounted to his head like wine, and
his look met hers with an intensity
that made her eyes droop. He turned
coolly to Mayne beside him and said
in a low tone:
"Look carefully at this ring on my
finger, and don't glance up! I want to
ask a question. Who is she?"
Strangely enough, Mayne knew who
"she" was.
"Dean Carroll's daughter. Rose," he
replied. Then, as they both looked up
carelessly, he continued: "I may as
well tell you that I shall try to get
her." Choking back a senseless anger,
trying to realize that Mayne had as
good a right to want her as he, Dun
ham nnswered quietly:
"And I may as well tell you that you
have ma to work against. I shall do
my best."
At the reception following John Dun
ham accosted his old professor, Dean
Carroll, shook hands and asked:
"Doctor, please Introduce me to your
daughter."
"Certainly, my boyâ with pleasure.
But"â and the old man laughedâ "I
warn you!"
"It's everlastingly too late, doctor.
All I ask of you is not to tell her I
wanted to meet her, and â not to praise
me to her." The serious eyes of the
young man checked the old man's
smile.
"Upon my soul! I believe you're in
earnest!"
"I warn you that I am." Dean Car
roll.'looked Dr. John Dunham over
carefully, from head to foot; then he
held out his hands.
"I wish you luck," he said slowly.
"You're as open now as you were dur
ingr the four years I knew you at col
leg-e and In your success Bince. Your
tactics are worthy of a general, and
victory. Come along â but perhaps
you'd like me first to suggest to her
that you're a dangerous character?"
John laughed contentedly.
"Better that' than encomiums."
Rose Carroll met her father's old
pupil none the less graciously because
he was tall and strong and because
the heavy, dark hair framing his
handsome j face was touched with
gray;, in fact, he was so interesting
that she met him with an armor of
protective resistance beneath her gra
ciousness. She was used to easy vic
tories over her admirers, but not anx
ious, though she was on the alert for
her own Waterloo. There was time
enough for that.
John began well.' While deferential,
he was not adoring; while entirely ap
preciative, he was not insistent in his
enjoyment of her society, which he
accepted with a sort of seemingly
transient 3plrit of camaraderie that
piqued her a little. Several times
during the evening he drifted care
lessly back near her and watched with
amusement Mayne's breakneck en
deavor to make use of his. time to Im
press his rather ponderous personality
upon the girl. Dunham asked per
mission to call next day.
He did call and was carelessly en
tertaining; he let himself go, showing
his real self, speaking of his youthful
adventures in the West, of his roses
at home, and leaving a sort of an im-

whoÂ»was not, as others, apparently in
the least subjugated by her charms.
He did not stay long, but as he rose
"This Is to remind you that
some day I shall brine you
that red rose.*'
to go he unwrapped a long, slender
parcel he had been holding, crushed
the tissue paper in his fingers and put
one perfect white rose into her hand.
He laughed down into her eyes.
"I wanted to give you a red one,
only â " The significance of his tone
and his hesitation made her rise to his
throw.
"Only you didn't dare!" she finished
for him.
"Oh, I dared," he replied coolly,,
"but I thought I wouldn't â yet! The
best for the last, you know." And he
left her trying to decide whether he
meant anything or nothing. As he
went out he met Mayne entering with
a large florist's box, and during his
call he had learned that she was leav
ing the next day for home. When he
reached his office he looked up the
northbound trains.
Next morning at 7:50 he walked up
to the station; just around the corner
on the platform he saw Rose Carroll,
smiling at Maj.;ne. who carried her
suit case and a great bunch of pink
carnations'; ; Before' they, saw him he
stepped back into the waiting-room,
bought a ticket to the next town
north and kept out of sight till the
train came in. lie swung on the reaf
platform, while Mayne, triumphant in
his moment of favor, put the lady into
a seat, bestowed ' her luggage about
her. As the train 'pulled out Dunham
looked from his window in the smok
er and beheld the idiotically adoring
face of Mayne, who was waving his
farewell.
When he had smoked a long black
.cigar John Dunham sauntered Into the
next car. About the middle of the aisle
he stopped suddenly at a quick excla
mation: "' i .-;Y
"Why, Mr. Dunham!".
, He looked down and saw, with appar
ent surprise. Rose Carroll, blushing and
smiling. He removed his hat, but made
no effort to take the seat which she
cleared for him beside her.
"Miss Carroll! So this Is your train
how pleasant! Lovely day. isn't it?"
"Won't you sit down?" she asked a
little timidly. And he did. and went on
talking so carelessly and yet so mean
ingly, so brightly and still so seriously,
that it seemed to her but a moment or
two before he looked from the, window
and stood up. Drawing a slender parcel
from his pocket he unwrapped a single,
long-stemmed pink rose.
"I must get off here In order to get
back to an important case with your
father. I only got on to tell you good
by. Didn't want to interfere with
Mayne at the station. I can't compete
Avith his floral generosity," and he laid
THE BEST OXE.
..Callerâ I'd like to suggest a name for

posed to spread so much destruction.

name doyou suggest?
-Callerâ The Hired Girl.;;
the rose In her lap, "but this is to re
mind you that some day I shall bring
you that red rose." He was gone, with
out touching her hand in farewell. She
sat gaspingâ pleased, astonished, half
angry, but completely Interested. She
looked at the pink rose. Then she
tossed the carnations from the window
and wondered how in the .world John
Dunham had managed to obtain her
promise to answer his letters.
Thereafter Dunham wrote her â not
regularly, but when the fancy seemed
to seize himâ whimsical, vigorous, joy
ful, masculine letters, wholesomely free
from lovemaklng. She answered, and
sometimes when he was very busy he
called her . up on the long-distance
'phone in lieu of a letter. Meantime
Mayne had sent bushels of flowers, had
written ponderously sentimental epis
tles and heaved many ponderous sighs.
Twice he had gone to see his divinity,
and on his last call her lack of interest
in his elaborate mention of Dunham
raised suspicion in his slow but relent
lessly logical mind. On his return he
sauntered into Dunham's office.
"Morning, old man."
"Morning, Mayne. Enjoy your visit?"
How the deuce did Dunham know
he'd been away? Mayne hazarded a
guesj.
"Yes, called on Miss Carroll. Write to
her, don't you?" Taken off guard, Dun
ham admitted the soft Impeachment
and was instantly sorry. Mayne
laughed with unctuous amusement.
"Thought you were too astute for
that. But she's got you going â has me!
Stringing you for all she's worth! Prac
ticed hand! Great girlâ no end popular.
Knows how to " do it,- Miss Carroll."
Dunham's anger rose, but he answered
carelessly:
"Lo Â»k lo yourself, Mrre; guers T
can take care of Johnny." But after
Mayne went the tide of his anger
surged toward Rose Carroll. "When
he. could stand it no longer, he went to
the 'phone, closing the door of the in
ner office, and called up St. Louis and
Miss Carroll. After an hour's delay he
got her, and went straight to the
point.
"That you. Miss Carroll? Know who
this is? Yes. Lovely spring day! I
want to ask you something. Forgive
my bluntness, but I must know. Miss
Carroll, in your letters and all, have
you meant everything? Or have you
been playing with me?" A long pause,
while he listened intently.
"No, I did not think so â I simply
asked. I have not the time â nor the
temper to play. You will forgive me
for asking you? No, I' can't tell you
what made me think of. such a thing.
Yes, some day I will. Certainly, I
believe you! What? May I? May
I come this week? Of course I want
to! But I can't reach you till Satur
day evening, and will have to start
back Sunday morning. It's a long
way, and connections are bad. All
rightâ good-byâ till Saturday!"
' At four in the afternoon of June 1
John Dunham stepped from his train
at St. Louis and went to a hotel to get
rid of his travel stains and appease his
hunger.
About seven he emerged faultlessly
attired,' visited a florist, and took a
cab to Dean Carroll's statelv old
home.
Rose came to him in the dim candle
light of the library, a vision in shim
mering gray. He had intended meet
ing her in his usual easy way, but
the clamor of his heart, and the wine
of a certain proud yielding in the
glance of her blue eyes, swept him in-
( to speechlessness. He stpod long look
ing at her, her hand still in his; then
he dropped the small hand back at
her side, and strode out into the hall.
In a moment he came back and
clasped her warm little fingers about
the stem of a glowing red rose.
"The red rose," he said simply, "the
time for it is now, isn't ft?" he ques
tioned quietly, stepping back with his
arms straight at his side to look at
her. "Isn't it time, dear?" he in'sisted.
"Yes," she murmured; "I â " And
as she did not finish, with a sudden
longing he held out both his hands to
her. "Will you come. Rose?" With
the pride of a small queen. Rose Car
roll laid her two hands in his.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. DECEMBER 6, 1904:
SOCIETY QUITS
DOLBEER CASE
Novelty of Going to Court
Seems to Have Worn Off
for Belles and Matrons
DAY'S TESTIMONY DULL
Draft Testatrix Executed
Few Hours Before Death
Introduced in Evidence
The "society corner" at the Dolbeer
trial yesterday was bare of occupants
who wear pretty millinery and fine
gowns. The novelty' of the experience
in court seems no longer attractive to
them. Attorney McEnerney says the
proponents will not close till next week.
The draft' for *S0O that Bertha Dol
beer drew in New York on the
morning of July 9. the day she met her
death at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
was introduced in evidence. John Turn
bull, the cashier to whom Miss Dolbeer
applied for the money, expressed an
opinion in the deposition that was read
to the jury that she was sane and ra
tional at the time. She conversed intel
ligently and signed the order without
betraying a sign of weakness of men
tal power.
The cross-examination of Addison
Mlzner was soon finished in the morn
ing. He produced a letter that he re
ceived from Miss Dolbeer while she was
in London. She wrote that she was
enjoying herself very much.
â Walter I. Treat, a salesman for
Shreve & Co., testified that on March
15 Miss Dolbeer purchased a sapphire
ring with two diamonds for $1400. She
was in perfectly sound mind, the wit
ness said.
Peter B. Kyne, stenographer for the
Dolbeer & Carson Company, told of the
visit of Miss Dolbeer to the office on
April 25 to get her first will, which was
deposited in the vault, and to replace it
with a copy of the new one she had
just made. To Kyne, who is not far
past his majority, $5000 was bequeathed
by John Dolbeer and the same amount
by Miss Dolbeer.
Clinton Worden, Mrs. A. X. Towne
and Mrs. Evelyn Towne Worden, who
knew Miss Dolbeer and met her at Del
Monte and in society, gave It as their
opinion that the testatrix was of sound
mind.
Leslie Elfendahl, chauffeur, eald that
he was in Miss Dolbeer's employ until
she sold her car in November, 1903. He
described many of her trips, said she
found keen delight in the diversion and
became a clever operator, displaying
rare good judgment and presence of
mind. He never noticed the slightest
indication of failing mind.
The will of John Dolbeer was intro
duced that the jury might see how his
daughter very largely followed its pro
visions in executing her own testament.
The trial will go on this morning.

The dread malady, kleptomania,

The contagious bacillus of the disease
made Its first attack on a woman yes
terday at the Emporium department
store. The periodically recurring af
fliction was rapidly , combated and
temporarily overcome by Special De
tectives Allen and Clinton.
"Mrs. - Marie Anderson, age 21
years, charge petty larceny"â such
â¢was the record entered last evening
at the Southern police station. Mrs.
Anderson was caught at 5 o'clock as
she was about to make* away with
eight gold breastpins valued at $40
and a bolt of silk ribbon.
Mrs. Anderson pleaded klepto
mania, but at the Central Emergency
Hospital Dr. Millar diagnosed her
complaint as "larcenus takus," a dis
ease that makes the fingers illegally
dexterous. Mrs. Anderson was -re
leased on *50 bail.

Bride as the Housekeeper of
the Groom Arouses the
Enmity of His Daughter
\ : -
After an extended courtship, which at
one time almost culminated in a trag
edy. Adolph H. Beth and Miss Clara
Lefevre â¢were married by Superior
Judge Murasky yesterday afternoon.
The ceremony was performed in the
presence of two friends of the contract
ing parties.
Beth's marriage to Miss Lefevra
brings to mind a bloody duel fought by
two women maddened with rage and
Jealousy, one the bride of . yesterday
and the. other Mrs. Anna. Speckman,
daughter of the groom. About two
years ago Beth took Miss Lefevre into
his home at 799 Cole street as house
keeper. His daughter, Mrs. Speckman,
objected. She and her father quarreled,
but Beth stoutly refused to turn Miss
Lefevre out. The culmination came
when Beth disowned his daughter. On
May 19 last Mrs. Speckman visited her
father's house on Cole street, as she
Bays, to get some trinkets she left be
hind. When Beth arrived home he
found the two women fighting in the
dining-room, one armed with a knife
and the other with a pair of scissors.
Their clothing was torn, their hair was
disheveled and blood was flowing from
many wounds on both.
Beth separated the combatants, who
were taken to the Receiving Hospital
for repairs. Charges of assault were
preferred, but the cases dragged on in
the Police Courts and no final action
was taken.
Mrs. Speckman first attracted public
attention about five years ago, when In
Alameda she killed her husband, to
whom she had been married but a
month, and then made an Ineffectual
attempt at suicide.
In the marriage license Beth's age
Is given as 56 and Miss Lefevre's as 34.

FAVORITES AT OAKLAND BURIED UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF LONG SHOTS
SLOW FIGHTING MARKS
OLYMPIC CLUB BOUTS
SAD NIGHT FOR WINGED Â».O"
Andy Gallagher's Opponent Absent
Crowd Cheers Game Lad.
The several unknown fist artists and
others who have shone in various rings
did little to make the members and
guests of the Olympic Club ehout lost
night. There -were eight bouts carded
and two of these would pass as fights
on Tehama street. The others might
have figured as a pink tea, but never
where a crowd of seasoned sports are
wont to congregate.
Before the entertainment had been
concluded. Announcer Frank Thomp
son, in a gentle voice, broke the news
to those present that J. Sullivan, who
waE due to mix it with Andy Gallagher,
â was not in the house, and as he did not
leave his residence address with/ the
directors they were powerless to ap
pease Mr. Gallagher's appetite ' for a
fight. Mr. Gallagher, garbed after the
style of Henry Irving, paraded
through the ring just to let the fans
knew he was there. Andy got a round
of applause and also a medal by de
fault. When he meets Mr. Sullivan in
a narrow alley- way he will probably
pet the decision, for it is evident that
the latter is afraid to take his beating
before a crowd.
Only one Olympian brought home a
medal. That distinguished young man
v.as Frank Flores and he made F. Nor
ton quit in three rounds with a few
5<Mid rights to the Jaw. I. W. Letcher
and Joe Leahy furnished the talked-of
mill. Leahy was all but gone in every
rour.d. but came back fighting each
time and in turn had his opponent

to Act Because of Uie
Kansas Incident.
CHICAGO. Dec. 5. â Followers of
the trotting: game are looking forward
to the session of the American Trot
ting Association at the Auditorium to
morrow, when it is expected that
Charles Ketcham, the owner of Cres
ccus. will be debarred from further
racing and that the famous stallion,
whose record of 1:53^ has for months
been under discussion, will also be de
riared out of the game, along with the
Wichita (Kan?.) track.
Evidence that the affair was "fixed"
by the owner of the stallion with the
fuli consent of the officials of the
track is said to have been unearthed
end according to the general belief in
tnrf circles the Wichita track. Ket
cham and Cresceus will be debarred
from further participation in racing.
The re-election of the present of
ficers of the association is said to be a
certainty.

Columbus, Ohio, May 20, 1903.
Six years ago I had a severe attack of
Inflammatory Rheumatism. I was laid up
in bed Tor six months, and the doctors I
had did me no good. They changed med-
icines every week and nothing they pre-
scribed seemed to help me. Finally I be-
fan the use of S.S. S. My knee and elbow
joints were swollen terribly, and at one
time my joints were so swollen and pain-
ful that I could not close them when
opened. I was so bad that I could not
move knee or foot. I was-gett ing discour-
aged, you may be sure, when I began S. S.
S., but as I savr it was helping me I contin-
ued it, and to-day I am a sound well man
and have never had a return of the disease.
S. S. S. purified my blood and cured me
of this severe case of Rheumatism after
everything else had failed. I have rec-
commended it to others with good re-
sults. R. H. Chapmau.

yearning for the bell. Letcher got the
decision and Leahy was given a medal
on Kddie Graney's suggestion, for his
gritty exhibition.
Jack Conroy, a bantam from the
Hawthorne Club, beat Jack Growley
down in four rounds. The former show
ed nice style and used both hands to
advantage. Pete Sullivan was too
many for Matt Granfleld of the winged
"O." and after Matt had gone down
twice in the first round and once in the
second Graney stopped the go and gave
Sullivan the verdict. Bert March could
nut take Jack McLaughlin's wallops
and his seconds came to his rescue
with a towel in the second.
J. Fitzgerald and J. McMurtry, the
only heavies, mauled each other around
the ring till every one was tired, and
when the latter's seconds tossed in the
distress signal every one felt gratified.
Joe Sonne knew more about boxing
than did Jimmy McBride, another
Olympian, and outpointed his man in
every round. Richard Gordon pot the
decision over Walter Merritt in the mill
that opened up the night's sport.
The tournament will close this even

PIPES BARKED
IN QUADRANGLE
Students of Stanford Have
Their Attention Called to
Unwritten Law of College
Special Dispatch to The Call,
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 5.â
"Until very recently the students of the
university" have respected the unwrit
ten law against smoking in and about
the inner quadrangle. Recently this
has been disregarded at the ends of
the arcades and at different places. I
trust that the students will not make
it necessary to change this unwritten
law into a written one. but in any case
the university -will not tolerate smok
ing about the recitation buildings nor
on the steps leading to them.
"DAVID STARR JORDAN."
Such was the order issued by the
president's office this morning:. It
caused a commotion among the stu
dents, who did not know that they had
been breaking any of the university
rules.
It seems that when Stanford was in
its first stages of construction Mrs.
Stanford expressed the wish that as
the university was to be a co-educa
tional institution there should be no
smoking on the quadrangle or near
the recitation buildings. This never
was a written law, but it has been sa
credlj- lived up to by the students. Only
at times has it been broken and then
by freshmen, who were soon told by
upper classmen of the wish of Mrs.
Stanford.
But smoking is a part of the stu
dent's life that he never entirely gives
ud, and the long morning hours grew
dull to the men when they could not
find solace in a quiet smoke. And so
between classes, when there Is a ten
minutes' recess, _ the men students
would P.ock to the eastern entrances
of *he quadrangle, where they would
puff happily away, not dreaming that
the:* were breaking the spirit of the
unwritten rule.
Dr. Jordan saw this, was displeased,
and so issued the order. The students
take the rule in good ptirt.

ANDREW B. COOK EASILY DEFEATED
BY FERGUSON'S THE MIGHTY.
u Big Bill" Knopf) Fust 071 Two Outsiders
The Lieutenant Drops
in at All Sorts
of Quotations.
BY FRED E. SIUIiHOLLiAXD.
Garnet Ferguson's colt The Mighty
administered a sound drubbing to An
drew B. Cook, the "bush Hindoo," over
the Futurity course at Oakland yester
day, and didn't make any bones over it
either, for he accomplished the feat
with consummate ease. All the friends
of the Cook horse made it a point to be
present, setting in their coin as a help
er in a sawmill would feed a buzz saw,
until the bookmakers were forced to rub
to 11 to 10. This enabled the admirers
of The Mighty to get 2 to 1 for their
money.
Travers rode Cook and experienced
some difficulty in shaking off Tacolaw
and Misty's Pride. This he ultimately
accomplished, though, and a furlong
from the wire looked a possible winner.
When Helgesen on the Ferguson colt
suddenly hove in sight the favorite
squawked ; and was subdued without
difficulty by more than two lengths.
H. L. Frank did not break with the
leaders and was not prominent. Misty's
Pride took the show.
The track over the bay was safe
enough, but speckled and slow. Some
excellent sport was witnessed,, even
though the favorites did fare badly.
Vaughan, Follow Me, Gallant ; Cassie
and The Lieutenant all won at long
odds.
Helgesen didn't do much with Mistle
tide, favorite for the opening seven
furlong event. The filly failed to show
any vast amount of speed, and at the
wire was fifth. The winner turned up
in Vaughan, a 20 to 1 shot, with Harry
Michaels in the saddle, which downed
Harka a length. McBride on Libbie
Candid, a 20 to 1 shot, was third.
Dr. Rowell's mare Briers ran a de
cidedly off race in the mile and a six
teenth selling event. Her price receded
from 3 to 5 to 9 to 10 and she finished
an Indifferent third. Mountebank,
after cutting out the pace, was beaten
in a gallop by Follow Me, a 15 to 1
shot, piloted by Knapp. Galanthus for
a time looked to have a chance, then
the Coffey entry faded away.
"Big Bill" Knapp appeared to have
on his riding clothes, for he came
through in the two-year-old scramble
with another long one.' He had the leg
up on Gallant Cassie, a 20 to 1 neplectr
ed outsider from the Miller stable, and
in a hard drive defeated Head Dance,
the mount of Sullivan, by half a length.
Head Dance closed favorite and only
for being pocketed more than two
.thirds of the route would have scored
hands down. Bob Ragon led Marie J
out for the show. George P. McNear
quit after displa'ying some early speed.
In the fourth, a seven furlong Belling
number, The Lieutenant, a 30 to 1 shot,
was awarded a nose decision over Lit
tle Wally. The odds about the latter
were played down from 7 to 5 to 7 to
10. Hugh McGowan closed very strong
and in a few more strides would have
beaten both of the leaders. Play Ball
did nothing, and Butler's riding of
North* West \vas*as usual a joke.
Byronerdale made it three straight
by capturing the final mile and a fur
long selling affair, closing a 4 to 5 fa
vorite. The big gelding raced Red
Cross Nurse into subjection, then came
home a clever first over . old Major
Mansir. Eight lengths farther away
Flying Torpedo finished third.

TRACK NOTES.
"Big Bill" Knapp and Harry Mi
chaels divided the saddle honors.
Knapp finished first on Follow Me
and Gallant Cassie, while^ Michaels
succeeded in making: the home plate
in front with Vaughan, a 20 to 1 shot,
and The Lieutenant, quoted at SO to 1.
Travers reached Oakland from Ben
nings Sunday night. He did not start
the season auspiciously, for his first
mount was on Dr. Rowell's Briers.
The mare was sore and would extend
herself no part of * the journey.
Travers did some brilliant work in the
saddle back East and will soon get
into his stride.
Frank Eckert is here and his slate
will be in evidence at the next draw
ing.
A. T. Van de Vanter, prime mover
in the Kings County Fair Association
of Seattle, was a visitor at the track
yesterday.
The Broadway Club is another boo_k
that will make the weight on Wednes
day. Spivens, the well-known St.
Louis penciler. will in all likelihood
cut in also.
1 M. D. Miller, the Chicago book
maker and owner of a big stable of
horses, Is a. fresh arrival. One por
tion of his string, in charge of Joe
Stern, has gathered in several purses
at . Oakland. Gold Enamel and
other good ones are now resting at Log
Angeles and will be seen here later
in the season. . - '
Boca, a three-year-old, owned by
Jeff Wells and trained by George Bur
ger, dropped dead on the track yester
day morning.
Allen Avon, the clever two-year-old
in the string of "Kansas" Price, is
dangerously sick and may notrecover.
Allen Avon was formerly the property,
of "Virginia" Bradley, that owner-los
ing him from a claiming race..
The El Primero- stable no longer
owns Head pance. The colt was
claimed from the third race for $825
by Early Wright, owner . of Ross
bourne. Wright also trains the horses
owned by Charley Henshall. V:- ,<-W:
- Ike Hakelberg: and L. Gilbert., two
well-known members of the Metro
politan Turf Association, . will reach
here within the next fortnight. -
Al Waddle, a colt owned by . Sam
Jones of Oregon, .was played from 15
down to 3 to 1 . in the betting on the
first race. It > was such a quiet good
thing that the < ' city poolrooms ' were
flooded with money. Waddle could al
ways step ; three furlongs with rapidity
and he accomplished the feat in the
rare.
Harry Stover chanced a ten-dollar
piece on The Lieutenant Wally Brink
worth bet enough money on his name
sake. . Little Wally. nosed out for first

SIX -DAY RICE
EULL OF FALLS
Cyclist Keegan Is Badly
Injured, but He' Pluckily
Returns to the Track
NEW YORK. Dec. 5.â The first tert
ous accident in the six-day bicycle race
at Madison Square Garden occurred
early to-day, when Patrick Keegan, the
Lowell, Mass., boy. was so badly hurt
that he was forced to leave the track.
While the men were engaged in a
heart-breaking sprint Hockowitz sud
denly went down, and Agraz of the
Australian- American team, who was
following close behind, crashed into
him. Just as both riders started to
slide down the embankment Keegan
came around at a terrific burst of
speed. His wheel struck Rockowitz and
Agraz with terrible force. Keegan
struck on his face on the board track.
He was a pitiable sight. His face was
covered with blood, which flowed from
his nose and from a deep cut across
his forehead, and his nose was broken.
Keegan's hurts were dressed by a
physician, and after a rest of an hour
or more he appeared on the track with
his head swathed in bandages and re
lieved his partner. Logan. He proved
his eameness by a remarkable burst of
speed as^oon as he took his place.
Frank Kramer, the champion sprinter
of the world, equaled the world's rec
ord for an indoor quarter-mile durln?
the afternoon, making: the distance in
24 2-5 seconds.
To-night the riders settled down to
their monotonous work, spurts being
few and fruitless. Some of the many
spills resulted in severe bruises. At 3
o'clock the leading thirteen teams were
nineteen, miles and eight laps behind
the record.
Frank Kramer, the American cham
pion, and Friol. the French champion,
to-night rode the first of three sprint
races, one-half mile, for the world's
championship. Kramer won in 1:14 1-5.
Kramer also won the second race.
Prlol led until the last hundred yards
was reached, when Kramer sprinted
and won by about six inches.
The midnight score in the six-day
race was: Walthour-Munro. Gougoltz-
Breton. Vanderstuyft-Steel, Dussol-
Mazan. Butler-Moran; Palmer-Agraz.
Samuelsan-Williams. Maya-Newkirk.
Bedell-Bedell. Root-Dorton, McLean-
Fowler, Turville-Mettling. Keegan-Lo
gan, each 480 miles 8 laps; Caldwell-
Hooper, Sulkins-Rockowitz. Downlng-
Llmberg, Krebs-Folger, each 4S0 miles
1 laps.
Record, twenty-four hoursâ 510 miles
1 lap.

and coast. It was the finding of, the
life preserver thrown to Olson -that
added force to the rumor of the ves
sel's destruction.
The men that find things on the beach j
of Vancouver Island are somewhat giv
en to enlarging upon their own conclu
sions in the reports sent out to the
world of their discoveries. By the time i
the tale of the finding of the Maka- i
well's life preserver reached the Mer- I
< hams' Exchange at this port, it was a ;
full grown story in which the life pre- [
server was a mere incident. Wreck
age had been found, said the report, '
part of the Makaweli's rail had been
picked up and the remnants of her
deckhouses and parts of her hull were
littering the beach. The shore of Van
couver Island was strewn with sou
venirs of the Makaweli, including, so
thf report read, the cargo cf lumber
with which the fine, new barkentine
wa= loaded. It wa.Â« this reference to- \
lumber that modified the effect of the {
report, as the Makaweli was carrying
.coal.
Hind. Rolph & Co. expressed confi
dence in the safety of their vessel from
the first and the underwriters, after
analyzing the report found in it little to j
worry them. To the friends and rela
tive* of the captain and his wife, and
of the officers and crew, the report
caused considerable worry and the an
nouncement of the Makaweli's safe ar
rival at Mazatlan will be welcome news
in many Quarters.

DR. SMITHERS.
RAPS UNIONS
Says the Cost of Buildings Is
Far Less in Los Angeles
Than in San Francisco
SOUTH ENJOYS LIBERTY
E. A. Sturge, M. D., Gives an
Interesting Account of
Japan's Big Kecruiting
That a handsome church can be j
built In Los Angeles for far less money j
than in San Francisco was told the j
Christian Church Ministers' Associa- j
tion yesterday by the Rev. Dr. A. C.
Smithers of the southern metropolis.
Dr. Smithers was telling of the erec
tion of a church for the religious body
to which he ministers and said it would
be one of imposing dimensions and
architectural beautv and the cost will
not exceed $12,000.
"Brethren," said the pastor, "you
could not duplicate the building in
San Francisco for anything like the
money and the reason is that in Los
Angeles we are not overridden by. labor
unions. There we enjoy American lib
erty."
The association resolved itself into
an executive committee and heard re-
ports on the preparations for the com
ing convention of the Christian church."
The Rev. P. C. ilacfarlane presided
and reDorts of progress were given by
the Rev. Walter M. White, D. D., the
Rev. Mr. Darst, Rev. W. B. Berry and
Dean Van Kirk, D. D.
E. A. Sturge, M. D.. gave the Pres
byterian Ministers' Association a
graphic and interesting account yester
day of social, spiritual and military
conditions in Japan. He told of the
humane characteristics of the Japan
ese, citing as instances their admirable
and liberal conduct of hospitals and in
stitutions for the blind and the deaf
and dumb and the completeness of the
Red Cross department of their army.
According to Dr^.Sturge, the Japan
ese army never lessens in strength.
When he was in Toklo some months
ago no less than 1,500.000 men were
ready to enlist and they were coming
all the time to offer their services.
Because, of the death of his child the
Rev. F. A. Keast did not preside at
the Methodist Ministers' Association
yesterday, his place being filled by the
Rev. W. S. Matthew, D. D. The body
sent a letter of condolence to the be
reaved colleague. A similar step was
taken in the case of Mrs. Nelson J.
Bird, expressing sorrow for the loss of
her husband. Dr. Bird.
After hearing an . address from Dr.
Matthew on "Evangelization." the
.ministers went in a body to inspect
and take luncheon at the Triangle
Tavern, which has been inaugurated
by the Y. M. C. A.
The Rev. E. S. Williams of Saratoga,
Santa Clara County, addressed the

Range Finders on Warships.
The British admiralty has suspended
the practice of fitting the position of
the range finder on an electric light
platform placed on the foremast of a
warship. It is imperative, to facilitate
the firing of the guns," that the , means
of ascertaining and transmitting the
range from the vessel to the antagonist
be communicated to the gun crew with
complete security, from ; a perfectly re-'
liable observing position.' The decision
of the naval department is due to the
result of the engagement" between the
Russian warship Varlag and the Jap
anese fleet. . In this conflict - the men
operating this vital department were
rendered hors de" combat early in the
engagement, with the; result that the
gun crews on the Varlag labored under
great disadvantages. From this ; It â¢ is
conclusively, demonstrated .that any ob
servation post placed in .the fighting
tops is impracticable. The Japanese
themselves have ' also recognized this
crucial point and in their. newVvessels
that are â  in course 'â¢ of construction ' in
England special armored observation
towers are to; be erected at various ad
vantageous positions on !. the ships ; for
the installation of the range-finding ap
paratus. In the case of the. British
naval (department '".' no decision has been
arrived at, 'though the matter is | under
discussion 'and investigation.â Scientific

UNUSUAL KINDS
OF INSURANCE
Risks Are Taken on Various
Members' or Organs "Which.
Livelihood IsDependent On
SEVERAL INSURE SKILL
Some Stars Renew Policy
pfor Each Public Appear
ance, Others Run for Years
In the early fall all over the world
during the beginning of the winter
musical and theatrical season a pecu
liar and large line of business is car
ried on in a certain channel of life in
surance, of which the general public
has little or no knowledge whatever.
By some underwriters it is termed
"freak insurance," and interests prin
cipally famous and notable celebri
ties in the musical and theatrical
fields, although this special line of in
surance has included costly trained
animals used for show purposes.
No less a personage than the cele
brated Mme. Patti was one of the
originators of this extraordinary kind
of insurance. Her gifted voice, which
has been heard all over the world and
which is the most intangible of sub
jects, is insured for $5000, on which
she pays a premium of $125 a per
formance.
. Paderewski, of international repu
tation, has his hands underwritten
for $50,000, and for each! of his con
certs a temporary policy is taken out
for $7500. " He considers his hands
more precious and valuabie to him
than any other member of his body,
for In the loss of them he would be
deprived of the means of revealing his
soulful music and making his liveli
hood.
Josef Hofmann, no less famous on
both continents, advocates most
strongly this kind of Insurance, as he
goes further into the financial end of
it, as can readily be seen when it is
known that he has set a price of $500
on each finger of both hands.
Think of it. Placing the sum of
$50,000 on the fingers of your hands!
As a matter of fact, Hofmann has
placed more Insurance on his fingers
than on his life. And the same treat
ment holds good for the vast major
ity of those who insure at a large fig
ure some particular portion of their
anatomy.
AGAIXST PARTIAL LOSS. 1
As a precaution against accident in
preventing him to open s his perform
ance, Kubelik, the famous musician,
has had his right hand insured for
$10,000"Tor each concert, and for $50,
000 against total disablement.
It was only a short time ago that
the scientific world was startled by the
unique and astonishing: faculty pos
sessed by Eva W. Spear, a young
woman of Bridgeport, Conn., who de
veleoped the rare and peculiar fac
ulty of being able to whistle through
her larynx. As far as known she has
the unique distinction of 'being:" the
only laryngeal whistler in the world,
without even an imitator. It has all
the softness and delicate shading of a
flute note and has already captivated
thousands who have heard it.
Following in the lead of leading
musicians and vocalists of the .world,
Miss Spear, who has afforded high
order of entertainment for cultured
audiences throughout the United
States the past few years, has had an
Insurance of $10,000 placed on her
voice and throat, and contemplates
this winter of having her throat un
derwritten for $3000 at every concert
at which she may appear in "whis
tling" numbers, which she does with
out the use of lips, tongue, larynx,
soft or hard, palate or cheek.
THE GOOD RIGHT ARMS.
Sousa, Damrosch, Victor Herbert
and other celebrated bandmasters and
orchestra leaders of the United States,
who skillfully wield with their right
hand the baton during every perform
ance of the musicians, have likewise
adopted the plan originated by Mme.
Patti of having their "good right
hand" insured against loss by acci
dent or inability to professionally
mark time.
Some suprlse was caused recently
among the uninitiated by the\" state
ment that the insurance of the late
Consul, the performing ape, was for
$125,000. As a matter of fact â and
without prejudice â this heavy insur
ance is the policy now followed by all
notable entertainers.
* It Is ' well known that large amounts
of Insurance have been placed on valu
able animals at home and abroad by
individual owners and proprietors of
circuses" and menageries, then why
should the sporting fraternity, with
speculative propensities, hesitate about
paying insurance premiums on the
lives of King Edward VII or other dis
tinguished members of the royal fami
lies of Europe, when they move about
the country, . sometimes traveling
among nihilists, who hae no great
amount of respect or love for them?
WHAT IS CALLED "FREAK."
That this is done is also a fact, and
for thin reason Kins Edward is known
to have his life insured for a larger
amount of money than any other liv
ing ' i man in the world. This line of
freak insurance obtains more widely in
Europe, however, than it does here in
the United States.
Scores of freaks in every rart of the
world, who ': have been born 'without
arms, but are blessed with feet, by
which members they sew, knit and use
in the same manner as people in gen
eral, who have come into the world
with a pair, of hands, have had their
lower extremities insured against loss
by; accident.' ' Deprived of their 'feet
they would be unable 'to, earn a living.
Many of the < uninitiated throughout
the country will thus learn for the first
time that many of the most "famous
and celebrated musicians, vocalists and
whistlers, .who use -their voices, * hands
and"throatsto entertain by .their rare'
gifts large audiences throughout the
world, - carry more insurance on their
hands and voices than the general run
of people do' on their lives.

GREAT DREDGING MACHINE
TEARS OUT SOLID ROCK
Most Powerful Accessory Is Brought
to Aid of Great Engineer
ing Enterprises.
The Susquehanna Iron Company's
big plant will be in operation within
thirty days. It has been finished and
the great furnaces are ready for the
ore. The stupendous 'task of digging a
canal or inland harbor nearly a mile
in length from the new outer. harbor to
the company's plant is now in prog
ress. This canal is to be 20 feet wide
and 23 feet deep. That is to say. it is
to be 23 feet below the mean level of
the lake, so that in some places the ex
cavation is to be forty feet in depth.
That's quite a big hole to dig In the
ground a mile long, but the BuffaJo
Dredging Company expects to dig it
and build solid cement wharves on
both sides of its entire length by the
first of next April.
It requires great engineering skill
and an enormous amount of physical
power to accomplish such a task.
There are 1400 feet of submarine work
to be done, nearly half of It through
the solid rock. Steam power and com
pressed air are accomplishing it.
When examinations were made It
â¢was found that a strip of rock nearly
a mile long, 200 feet wide and ten feet
in thickness had to be cut out. It is
not shale rock or slate, but solid living
rock. The Buffalo Dredging Company
is ripping through that solid ledge of
rock with a steam shovel. The dredge
used for that purpose is the greatest
tool of its kind in the world. It looks
like a giant mud dredge and is built
on the same principle as an ordinary
dredge. Down in Its hold it has a 500
horsepower steam engine. Its anchors
or spuds are made of giant Oregon fir.
.flfty-three feet long and forty-four
Inches through. It has a dipper or
dredge with a capacity of seven cubic
yards. One man. with a dozen levers
before him, operates the whole ma
chine. â Buffalo Express.
Joe Wheeler Still Ready.
General Joseph Wheeler ("Fighting
Joe") of Virginia thinks of going to
Manchuria as a spectator of the war
between Russia and Japan. The only
difficulty in the way is that of ex
pense, for General Wheeler is by no
means a rich man. He has always
been of opinion that in the end Rus
sia will win by weight of numbers and
superiority of resources. "Japan's
only hope," says the general, "was in
a series of smashing blows quickly de-"
livered which would have shattered
Russian power in the Far East In short
order. They have not been able to do
this, and. in my judgment, Russia will
certainly outlast them. Japan is now
approaching the first serious crisis of
the war. I refer to the conditions at
home. The first flush of triumph is
past. The hardship of modern war is
now being felt. There is hardly a
home in all Japan where there is not
mourning for a lost or wounded soldier.
The Japanese are experiencing the bit
terness and sorrows of war and soon
will have to show whether they care
to go on losing men."
Teaching Tourists Good Manners.
Bully for Colorado Springs! It made
three tourists from Nebraska come back
and obliterate their names from rocks
in the Garden of the Gods under threat
of worse punishment. It has a big stick
after the advertisers, also, who deface
scenery by their: signs. The news is
enough to- make lovers of beauty want
to emigrate to the charming city at the
foot of Pike's peak. â Philadelphia

EASTERN* MARKETS.
New York Stock Markcu
NEW TORK. Deo. 5â Dealings in stocks cx
pan&ed a*ain to-dar and the level cf price*
receded In â¢pite of marked gains In a number
cf-tfcs stock* la which the trading wai heavi
est. The sustaining power of these marked
*cvai.ces was effective during, the early part
or toe day and made possible large proft-t&k
ing with email effect upon price*. But " uixm
the unexpectc-d announcement of the purchase
cf a million dollars in gold bars at the Assay
Office fcr export to Europe to-morrow the mar
ket- gave way quite gent-rally. Thu effect of
thiÂ» news was aggravated by the information
that all available supplies of gold bars had
be*n t- j- ; â  h< r. fcr contemplated â  further ship
ment. The agents In this transaction were
exceedingly reticent regarding it. and the
ssystery surrounding it gave it additional in
fluence. The gold is generally supposed to be
destined for Berlin, although conjecture on
the subject ranged so widely as to include a
Japanese destination. The latter sur
miw may be dismissed as chimerical. Hut
.what extraordinary need there may be for gold
at any point that, causes such a special in
ducrtntnt ** mutt be necessary to take gold
Jrcm New York in the present state of the
foreign money market is a mystery to experts
in that department. The snarp decline in the
price of exchange en Saturday and again this
morning under the largely augmented supply
of cottcn bills caused the definite dismtesal of
pofsibie gold expert* from the realm of stock
market factors. Sentiment was all the more
Effected on that account by the news of the
.engagement. The transfer through the Treas
ury Deiiartment of $500.Â«iOO to San Francisco
and of S300.CKM to New Orleans made the feel
:r.g over the money outlook additionally sen
sitive. The money rate Itself was barely af
fected. Iâ r,d ;n discounts rweded this morning
and the price of gold there was marked down
an additional frartlon. The undisturbed tran
quillity of the money market effected some re
assurance and contributed to thÂ« later rally la
nocks. The strength in the market was gen
eral at the opening, induced by the strong
(.losing en Saturday, the good bank statemrnt
tad tbe Government's estimate of a bumper
icttcn crop. ThÂ«- rise in Reading to near hi
was not accounted, for by any new6 regarding
th* property, and there was a dlsposalon to
rtgard the movement as involving a negotia
tion against an outside line of bucket sheps.
A numtrf-r of the industrials made striking
movements, notably the leather stocks. Rail

THE SAN FRANCISCO- CALL: -TUESDAY^ 6, 1904.
Â«n active commiMlon house demand prices
neadily advanced. Snow was reported to have i
fallen throughout Kansas and Oklahoma, but
this bearish influence appeared to be totally
ignored. News from the. Northwest was bull- |
jFh. advices from Minneapolis stating that '
larxt sales of flour had been made there. The j
reports of flour sales, however, lacked con
firmation. A private cablegram from Austra
lia said that the wheat crop of that country
16 being seriously damaged by extreme heat, j
Additional bullish enthusiasm was created |
about the middle of the day by a report from j
a Chicago crop expert who is now in Argentina.
According to this, authority the. wheat crop
of the South American country Is in a critical |
condition, nearly one-half of the total crop
having been damaged by rust. The report '
was not replete with details, but it stated
that notwithstanding an Increase of nearly
2.000,000 In acreage the total crop is 15, 00O,(KK)
bupheis 1cm than last year. j
Theee figures were alarming to shorts, and
throughout the remainder of the day there was ,
an urgent demand from that source. Just
prior to the close May sold at $1 13*4 and
closed at ?1 13%. .
A large increase in the movement of the
new crop vis the dominant influence of the
corn crop. May closed at 44%@45c.
Weakness of corn had a depressing effect on
the oats market. May closed at 30*i@30%c.
Considering the immense hog receipts the J
provisions market held remarkably steady, al- i
though prices phowed a small decline. At the .
close May pork was off 7UÂ«?lCc. lard was I

Beans and Seeds.
A letter from Ventura to the LoÂ« Angeles
Times says:
"The Lima Bean market Is stagnant at (3 90
per hundred. Holders â the growers â are In
clined to' hold on for 4c a pound, while buyers
are not offering more than $3 $0 and not clam,
oring for Llmaa. even at that price. There
seems no outside demand for the Lima, East
or elsewhere. There has been but little move^
ment in Llmas this .. eeason. Of the 350.000
sacks grown In this county the 'past season no
more than SO.000 sacks have been shipped out,
bringing all the way from $3 50 to ?1 a hun
dred. Some of this 60,000 sacks, too. consisted
of last year's Beans, of which nearly 80.000
sacks were held over.
"The grower Is not anxious to sell. He In
sists that the lull is but temporary and that
soon or late there will come a crying demand
for the Beans and that he will be able to un
load at a much better figure than |3 00, the
rultng price."
Otherwise there Is nothing new. The mar
ket is of a holiday character. Beans being In
active at the old familiar quotations, and
Seeds as before quoted. Some Eastern Alfalfa
Seed Is at hand.

BEGINS FIGHT
FOR FORTUNE
George Monnier Will Try to
-Obtain Share of Big Es
tate Left by Wine Owner
The legal fight over the possession of
the 5225,000 left by the late wine manu
facturer, George Monnier,. began in
earnest yesterday morning In Judge
Graham's court. George D. Collins,
counsel for the proponents, attempted
to make George Monnier Jr. prove that
he had the rieht to contest the will on
the ground of legitimacy. The court
ruled that the points should be decided
by the jury in connection with the oth
er issues of the contest.
Collins In his opening statement ' to
the Jury asserted that George Monnier
Jr. was not even the natural son of
George Monnier Sr., but adopted at the
request of the old man's wife, Johanna
M. Monnier. The boy was given an
education and treated affectionately,
but in return, the counsel claimed, he
repaid them with curses and blows,
even to breaking a cane over his fos
ter-father's head. Collins said that it
was on account of this treatment that
the father disinherited his adopted son.
Matt Sullivan, for the contestants,
said that Monnfer's treatment of the
young man was always friendly, and
the son loved his father. The son mar
ried Violet Henry against the wishes of
his foster-Darents, but the old man
would have relented but for the influ
ence of Johanna Monnier, who, Sullivan
claimed, led him to disinherit his son.
Sullivan further said that George
Monnier JrT was the natural son of
Monnier and Mary E. Darling, and that
he was legally adopted and later bap
tized aa his son, with the consent of his
wife. The defense alleged that as the
baptismal certificate was written in
Latin Monnier did not know what he
was signing. This was disproved and
the record was admitted.
Mm. Elizabeth D. Leslie testified that
she had a conversation with Monnier
Sr/ when the son was a little boy. In
which the old man Indirectly admitted
that the child was his son by another
woman than his wife. The defense at
tempted to shake her statement, but
failed. .
Leon Miclo and Elsie Mugge,' formerly
employed by Monnier Sr., testified that
the relations between father and son
were always friendly. Miss Miclo said
that the father suppled the young
couple with money unknown to the
wife, .who objected ] to] their receiving
aid from him. The case will go on this
morning -at 11:80 o'clock.

other absentees were: â ' J. W. Carmany,"

In the raport of the majority, Jurors
Maurice , Levy and George '.., Purlenky
took exceptions to the portion referring
to the Mayor's. not having taken cog
nizance of the actions of certain of his
Commissioners. Theodore Bonnet, .Wil
liam Broderick and James C. Nealon
dissented : from the comments on the
Assessor .without wishing to impugn
the honesty of his. official acts. Those
who concurred in all" of the report
were:. Foreman Alfred Lilienfeld,
Charles A. Mcl^ane, Milton H./Esberg,
Maurice. Block and Otto Jungblut.
The major report found that "certain
Commissioners were engaged in prac
tices not consistent with a high sense
of civic duty" and cited that one Po
lice Commissioner was in the insurance
business, with the bulk of his income
derived from saloon-keepers, and an
other in the cigar business getting a
portion of his income from the same
source. The Election Commissioners,
the report declares, "were criminally
negligent in the performance of their
duties and with criminal Intent they
violated the laws"; that gross frauds
were perpetrated at the August pri
maries and that the election machin
ery v.as handled In a manner most dis
creditable.
The Jury believes that there Is room
for great Improvement in the Board of
Public Works. It is thought that the
question of the right . of the School
Board to the expenditure of public
school rmoney Bhould be Judicially de
termined.
POLICE INADEQUATE.
The jurors say they are impressed
with, the necessity of removing the
Police Department from the influence
of political masters, and recommend
the election of four Police Commis
sioners by the Superior Judges. The
police force is said to be entirely in
adequate, and the employment of one
hundred more patrolmen Is recom
mended.
It is urged. that the School depart
ment provide fire escapes and flre
alarm systems for all the buildings.
The Public Library is said to need
more light and room.
In the report there are various de
grees of praise for the Assessor,
Health Department, Board of Super
visors, Tax Collector, City Attorney,
Golden Gate Park, County Clerk.
Sheriff. St. Catherine's Home and the
District Attorney. It is recommended
that the latter be permitted to employ
three detectives for. use. in his office.
Ono of the minority, reports was
filed by Dr. George I. Drucker, xas
chairman of the committee on public
â¢welfare. - His first recommendation
is that "the presiding Judge especially
direct future grand Jurors not to
communicate: any of the proceedings
of a Grand Jury to any one connected
with a newspaper.
' An amendment' to the laws is sug
gested whereby, it, will hereafter be
impossible for citizens who have held
partisan offices to become members of
grand Jurtes. Political -partisanship
of members is said to have tinged
their actions, and as an example the
report instances "the . accusation
brought against -the Election â¢ Com
missioners as a concession to ; undue
influence and to political prejudices."
It is Â« declared that the attacks of the
press- and this Jury upon Mayor
Schmitz and: his appointees "are en
tirely unjustified and wholly without
foundation."
The report finds that the â¢ County
Hospital and Almshouse are crowded
and the cutting down of appropria
tions by the Supervisors for these in
stitutions is characterized as the j re
sult, of antagonism , to other depart
ments and a monstrous act, which
leaves the sick. and' poor to.die un
cared for.
FOR -FUTURE JURY.
The report says that, in Chinatown it
is apparent thafthe laws against gam
bling: are being constantly, violated, and
it is safe to believe that the stories rel
ative to payment for protection are
true. â¢ Further investigation is - recom
mended. ; The" social evil is^ discussed,
and the committee believes that if
brothels must exist they would be much
better in Chinatown than in many of
the locations where they now exist.
The other, minority report was offered
by James C. . Nealon and is a : criticism
of , the Assessor's office, with' "no desire
to find fault with; individuals or/ cor
porations." . . â¢: â â  , " .' â .:'â â '..'â 
Mr. Nealon declares . that it is well
known ,that real; estate. values in this
city are riot subject to violent fluctua
tions; that this is not a boom town;
that the value of realty is rising in â¢ a
safe and sane ratio.. He then discusses
the ) assessments of several large and
well-known properties : for , the years
1902-03-04, and refers to the. changing
values of the Palace Hotel corner, be
longing to .the Sharon estate, as "scan
dalously volatile conduct.? 'He -says
that if the values ; as assessed in i 1904
are a - criterion* for last 'â  year; then , the
Phelan-Sulllvari. estate paid taxes on
$1,186,990 less last year than ithis, the
Parrott estate $839,730 less and the
Sharon estate $1,397,930 ' less. ' In ' the ten
pages of his report many other'assess
ments are mentioned, and he concludes
by saying: "If .we combine the work of
a physician with a large and lucrative
practice " with' the .work " of an Assessor
in a large and -growing. .cltyv-it'is nat?
ural ; to presume i that , the . public . busi
ness may suffer." -He recommends that
steps be taken to amend or enforce, the
law ;so every official -of the? city and
county will give his, entire time " to the
duties -of his office. ' :

POLICE SCANDAL
DISSIPATES WHEN
PROOF IS ASKED
Charge of Corruption
in Chinatown Is
Partly; Heard.
THE witnesses who tried to prove that â  police corruption
exists in Chinatown failed to substantiate any of the
charges before the Police Commissioners yesterday. R. A.
. Crothers and Fremont Older were forced to admit in answer
to direct questions propounded by Attorney A. Ruef that they
had only hearsay evidence. Attorney Grant Carpenter said that
he had been told that a corruption fund was raised in China
town, but was not informed, that it was paid to Schmitz, Ruef,
Drinkhouse, Reagan or YVittm an. Police Commissioner Hut
ton said that there "had been less gambling under the present
administration than under preceding ones.
The investigation of the charges that
corruption and crime are rampant in
Chinatown is nearing the end. The
Board* of. Police Commissioners held a
meeting yesterday afternoon to hear
the evidence of R. A. Crothers and
Fremont Older, who made the charges,
and then/ in view of such testimony, to
determine what further action should
be taken. i
Crothers and Older insisted that they
give their testimony before the board
In executive session. A few minutes
prior to their arrival, however, Attor
ney A. Ruef appeared on behalf of him
self and' Mayor- Schmltz and requested
that the hearing: be open. While he
was making: his statement the wit
nesses referred to appeared, but seeing
Mr. Ruef in action they withdrew, into
the corridor.- After some discussion the
board decided that' the wishes of
Messrs. Crothers and Older that their
testimony . be given before the board
In executive session should be respect
ed. Then Mr. Ruef submitted two
questions which he requested the com
mission to put to "the witnesses.
These questions were accompanied by
a letter of explanation/ the most salient
portion* of which follows:
The important question in this investigation
it seems to me la not whether gambling has
been going on In Chinatown or whether the
Chinese gamblers have been paying money to
other Chinese ostensibly for protection, i These
matters were discovered and determined In the
affirmative Ions ago by ' Mayor Schmltz In a
full and complete investigation of the condi
tions in Chinatown, have been matters of com
mon information for many years and I re
spectfully suggest that for the purpose of your
investigation it may be assumed that these
conditions do exist.
ThÂ« important . question, the only remaining
question, and the question which' grave rise to
this Investigation, is whether the fund mo col
lected is paid over to any person or Â«et of per
sons whether in the Police Department or out
of it. for protection, through the Police Depart
ment, of gambling in Cfclnattown.
RUEE"S TVYO QUESTION'S.
The questions propounded by Mr. Ruef
follow: â¢ ' 'â  â  ' "';â  .
Question | No. 1â Have you any evidence or
proof whatsoever showing that Mayor Schmitz.
Police Commissioner I>rinkhouse, Polio* Com
missioner Reagan, Chief of Police Wlttman and
A. Rucf, or either or any of them, has at any
time received any, moneys for protecting- gam
blir.K In Chinatown, as charged by you in the
Bulletin? If so, please state or produce it.
Question No. 2â Do you swear that Mayor
Schmitz. Police Commissioner Drinkhcuse. Po
lice Commissioner Reagan. Chief of Polioe
Wlttman A. Ruef. or any or either of them,
has at any time or at any place or from any
person whomsoever, directly or J ndl "* u> vâ¢"
celved any moneys or other consideration what
soever for tho protection of gambling; nCtuna
town as charged by you in the Bulletin 7
In answer to these questions, it was
announced after the conclusion of the
hearing/both Mr. Older and Mr. Croth
ers testified that the only evidence they
had" to substantiate the charges was
that furnished by a reporter to the ef
fect that the reporter had been told by
several Chinamen that a fund was be
ing collected in Chinatown for the pro
tection of the gambling: interests,, but
to whom, it was being paid the wit
nesses did not know. Crothers and
Older were unwilling to swear that, so
far as they knew either Mayor Schmitz,
Police ''Commissioners Drinkhouse or
Reagan or Chief of Police Wlttman, or
either of them, had received any of
these alleged collections and stated that
their inference that such was the case
was based entirely on deduction, on the
fact that' money was being collected in
Chh.atc/wn for the purpose of corrupt
ing officials according; . to information
supplied them by a reporter arid Attor
ney Grant* Carpenter, who had aided
their reporter in gathering his facts.
ORIENTAL TESTIFIES.
As soon as Mr. Crothers and Mr. Older
withdrew a lean Oriental, who gave his
name: as- Dong Hong Ku, who kept
books at a Washington street gam
bling house, was called to tell what he
knew about the inmates of a gam
bling house at: 826 Washington street
receiving word that Police Commission
er Hutton was about to vi6it the placed
He was scattered In his views and was
not long held on the stand. Another
Oriental supplied some more misinfor
mation, and then James J. Scott, a Bul
letin reporter, was called":to tell his
story upon which the charges of cor
ruption were predicated^ /',
.;.; Scott told' about going to Chinatown
in - search of gambling, finding Chinese
going and coming from 820 Washington
street, and 'finally.; finding Police, Ser
geant Ellis, .-â whom he asked to.accom
pany him to the place. This Ellis con
sented to do, but when they arrived at
the resort it contained nothing but
eight tables and two sleepy Chinamen.
Then he searched further and. was told
by several Chinese, whose names he
gave the commission; that a fund â  was
paid weekly .-, to a combination of Ori
entals known as "the eight statesmen,"
who, it wus inferred, paid the money
over to the officials for protection.
Continuing. . Scott - testified . that . he
did not know to .whom the money was
paid ;i he had' received no information
that is was paid to either Mayor
Schmitz, Attorney Ruef, Police Com
missioner Drinkhouae,- or Commission
er. Reagan or Chief Wittman. He said
he had never told Messrs. Crothera or
Older that such was the case.
Attorney Grant Carpenter testified on
exactly the same lines. Se said he
had been .told that a corruption fund
was collected weekly in Chinatown, but
to whom It was paid he had no Idea.
He had 'never told Messrs. Crothers or
Older that the officials named were
sharing: In the spoils, and had given
them no Information that would assist
them .in their effort to. determine who
was receiving the bribe money he waa
sure was being collected.
WITTMAN OX THE STAND.
.Chief of Police Wittman was the last
witness. He testified 'as to the efforts
of the police to stamp out gambling In
Chinatown â  and told of the difficulty
that frequently confronted the depart
ment In view of injunctions that were
secured by the various incorporated
societies of Orientals.
â¢In conclusion, in answer to questions
put bv Mr. Ruef, he said:
' "I can testify that the ' town waa
never, so free of gambling as at pres
ent. There is less gambling in the
city under the present administration
than during the administrations of ex-
Mayors Phelan. Sutro or Ellert;. in
fact, there is less than at any time
during my connection with the Police
Department, which extends over a
perio4 of twenty-four vears.
"That is true." said Police Commis
sioner; Hutton, and every one looked
surprised. "I . know there is less
gambling in the city in general." con
tinued Hutton. "than during past ad
ministrations, but that doesn't answer
the question here Involved."
This afternoon at 2 o'clock three safes
that were taken from Washington
street . houses will be examined in
search of proofs of the alleged corrup
tion funds. In one of the safes it is
said there is $6000 in gold, which must
be returned to its owner. In the oth
ers It is said there is nothingâ nothing
that would give even the faintest clew
to even the nature of the resort from

KICKANDSCREAM
Baby's Awful Suffering from
Eczema.
Could Not Hold Her. She. Tore
Her Face and Anns.
Uuticura Saved Her Life, So
Mother Says.
" When my little girl wu six months
old, the had eczema. We had oaed
cold cream* and all kinds of remedies,
but nothing did her any good. In fact,
she kept getting worse. I used to
wrap her hands np, and when I would
dress her, I had to pat her on the table
for I coald not hold her. She woald
kick and scream, and when she coald,
she woald tear ber face . and arms
almost to pieces. I csed foar boxes of
Cntlcnra Ointment, two cakes of Cntl-
cnra Soap, and gare her the Catlctrra
Resolvent, and she was cured, and I see
no traces of the humonr left. I can
trnthfally say that they hare saved her
life, and any one a offering as she did, I
phonld advise them to give Cnttcnra a
fair trial." MRS. O. A. CONRAD, Lis-
bon, N. H., Feb. 7, 1893.
Five years later, viz., Feb. S3, 1903,
Mrs. Conrad writes :
" It is with pleasure that I can
inform you that the core has been per-
manent as it is now six years since she
was cored, and there has been no retnrn
of the disease since, and I have advised
a lot of friends to use the Cutlcnra
Remedies in all diseases of the skin."
Instant relief and refreshing sleep for
skin-tortured babies, and rest for tired,
fretted mothers, in warm baths with
Cntlcnra Soap and gentle anointings
with Cutlcura Ointment, the great skin
cure and purest of emollients, to be
â  followed in severe cases by mild doses
of Cntlcnra Resolvent. This Is the
purest, sweetest, most speedy, p sr- '
manent and economical treatment for
torturing, disfiguring, itching, burning,
bleeding, scaly, crusted and pimply
skin and scalp humours, eczemas,
rashes and irritations.
