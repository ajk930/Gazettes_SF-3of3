The convention will, in all
probability, as Is the glory of all
Democratic conventions, be an
animated one, for, unlike our
opponents, the Republicans, we
have no slate, and our conven
tion will be something more
than a ratification meeting. It
will be a consultation â¢ of the
Democrats of the State and the
debaters upon the floor to bring
about the results, for Demo
crats always exercise their rights
at a convention to counsel and
discuss their affairs in order to
reach conclusions, rather than
delegate' to a few leaders the
settlement of all questions that
win come before the convention.
M. F. TARPEY.
HEARST INSISTS
ON INSTRUCTION,
TARPEY STATES
MR. HEARST'S friends will
insist that the desires of
the Democratic votes of
the State shall be crjs
stallizcd into an instructed na
tional delegation from the State.
I do not think there is any ques
tion of the temper of the very
large majority, amounting to an
almost unanimous wish, to voice
that sentiment in this State- Con
vention.
The San Francisco organiza
tion feels that it has achieved
more in the elevation of munici
pal government than any other
organization in America. It Is
proud of the officials who have
through it been given to San
Francisco, none of whom has
violated a pledge or failed â¢ In
devotion to duty. The San Fran
cisco Democrats feel that if they
have peace they can achieve
great things â things which ac
complished will extend the in
fluence and power of the party
throughout the State. We hope
that this convention win result
In a united Democracy. ' We be
lieve that this result can be se
cured If the extremeists on each
side will listen to the arguments
that are being presented to them
by the many able, patriotic, and
unselfish men who are laboring
here for the good of the cause.
GAVIN" SIcXAB.
I BELIEVE that I speak for
I the San Francisco delegation
when I say that above all
thlnss It seeks to create in
this convention a spirit of har
mony. Conventions should not
be a series or revenges like Cor
sican vendettas. Rather should
every convention be a clearance
house where animosities and
factions are extinguished. The
sole legitimate object for the
existence 'of parties is the ad
vancement of. principles vital to
the happiness and welfare of the
people. When these purposes
are abandoned for factional or
personal strife the usefulness of
the party ends.

LOUISVILLE. May 15.â In a scath
ing editorial in the Courier- Journal
Henry Watterson denounces the meth
ods e.rid men employed by W. R. Hearst
to obtain the votes of the Kentucky
delegates to the St. Louis convention.
V.'attereon Â¦ declares his belief that
Hearst is insane. He says:
"Of Hearst himself the Courier-Jour
nal desires to speak, and has from the
first spoken In terms of personal kind
ness. There are some reasons why we
prefer to hold him in friendly regard;
none why we should not. That he Is an
insane man ought by this time to be
clear to all who have watched the
course of his truly insane campaign.
"Two million dollars is a good sum
even to the Hearst estate, though any
one with an occasional gleam of sanity
cuph t to know that under the condi
tions which face Hearst J200.000.000
4vould not suffice.
"And so it is that we unhesitatingly
declare It our fixed belief that the ex
â¢ placCtion of a spectacle so astounding,
eo revolting, maybe found in the cir
cumstance that Hearst Is mentally un
balanced and not wholly responsible for
nhat would otherwise be the most go-
Rantic fakeânot even excepting the af
faire Humbertâ of modern times in this
cr in any other country."

SANTA CRUZ, May 15. â There is
beautiful fighting along the whole line.
The forces opposed to instruction, un
der the leadership of Gavin McXab,
with Frank H. Gould of San Francisco
as their candidate for chairman of the
Democratic Stao Convention, are con
fronted by the Hearst followers, under
the leadership of M. F. Tarpey. with
former' Lieutenant Governcr W. L
Jeter of Santa Cruz as their chosen
.man for the honor of presiding.
Among the Democratic chieftains In
tho thick of the fray around the stand
ard of Gould are Gavin Mc^ab, Frank
lin K. Lane, San Francisco; Thomas
J. Geary, Sonoma: Isidore Dockweiler,

Quite a large body of McXab's re
serves, known as the San Francisco
delegation, is in the metropolis at this
hour and cannot leave there in time to
effect a Junction with the main column
in Armory Hall before the convention
is called to order.
The Hearst men may make a deter
mined effort. to capture the first line of

Xab may find it a hard task to dis
lodge Tarpey If the latter intrenches
himself behind the temporary chair
manship. If the fight is "pulled off"
before the San Francisco delegates get
here the roar of indignation will rat
tle slats from the Sierras to the sea.
There is talk to-night of advising the
organization Democrats in San Fran

PUES LASH
TO HEARST
The opinion of an eminent strategist
given to -the Associated Press to-day
is that the Japanese Intjnd to "attack
not only Liaoyang, but along the line,
in an effort to drive General Kuropat
kin into Mongolia, where the Chinese
are waiting for. him.
Knowing these conditions. General
Kuropatkin* he says, would not be like
ly to make serious resistance (at Kai
ping or Haicheng.but would withdraw
to the V north; . This would enable : the
Japanese to march .on , Newchwang
with'little hindrance and obtain an un
opposed use of; that point as a base
from which men_and. supplies could be
sent north_without any violation of the
neutrar zone west of the Lalo River.
The authorities here do not forget
that the Boxer revolt. Which spread
from Shantung, would have involved
the entire empire had It not been'' for
the firmness of "the southern viceroys.
The military authorities in St. Peters
burg claim to have information of a
sensational character to the effect that
the Chinese have -agreed to co-operate
with the Japanese operations against
the Russians. The Japanese purpose,
.it is 3tated, to drive General Kuropat
kin's forces Into Mongolia, which
would place the Russians in the posi
tion of invaders of neutral territory
and enable reprisals by General Ma's
army, which, it is asserted, is kept in
that region for that special object, thus
cleverly avoiding the slightest in
fringement of the neutrality of China
by Japan. TherChinese troops, by not
crossing the Manchurian frontier, could
not be charged with a violation 5 of
pledges in respect to non-interference
In military operations in Manchuria.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 15â In view
of the official dlspatohes regarding the
hostile attitude of the Chinese within
and without the Russian sphere of In
fluence, the authorities ,here do not
conceal their apprehension as to the
outlook, especially in the north of the
empire, for they purpose to call the at
tention of the Chinese Government to
the Impending uprising in Tapadzlatsl
in order that repressive measures may
be instantly taken.
It is known and appreciated here that
all the powers have made rep
resentations to Peking in the interest
of the preservation of the tranquillity
of the Chinese empire, but it is stated
that General Pflug's dispatch of May
14 shows the necessity for further Im
pressing the Chinese Government with
the advisability, of acting with a firm
hand. "

Leaders Planning
for Control of
Meeting.
RENO, Kerf, May 15.â By the break-
Ing of one of the strands of the sus
pension tramway across the Truckee
River at Lahghldn's. Springs, five miles
west of this city, at 2. o'clock to-day
four young people, Maurice Jacobs, a
young business man of this city; Miss
Nita McMillan, daughter of a prominent
Reno business man; Mrs. E. S. Ede
Jr. and C. T. Tilsman of Chicago,
were precipitated from the car into the
swollen stream and drowned. The ac
cident was witnessed by Fred Coleman
of San Francisco, who was unable to
render any assistance.
The tramway consists of two steel
cables stretched across the river, upon
which a car much used by pleasure
seekers runs. To-day the four young
persons entered the car to cross the
river. When they reached midstream
one of the strands parted. A shriek
was heard and the four were observed
for a few moments struggling in the
rapids. Both young men were athletes
and gave up their lives in a heroic ef
fort to save their companions.
Jacobs wag seen for a few moments
swimming with Miss McMillan, holding
her above 'water, when in her terror she
grasped his arms and both went down.
Kingsley swam for 200 yards holding
Mrs. Ede's head above water, then was
seen* to turn on his back the better to
save her, when she seized him and bore
the strong swimmer beneath" the cur
rent. There was no time that the young
men could not apparently have saved
themselves, although at the place
where the accident occurred there are
swift rapids, the water seething over
great rocks.
Hundreds of people are searching for
the bodies of the victims of the acci
dent, but up to a late hour to-night
only one has been recovered. Under the
direction of Chief of Police Leeper
electric lights have been strung across
the river at intervals for several miles
and nets have been placed. The search-,
ing party Is exploding dynamite over
the still waters of the stream, but thus
far their efforts have been unavailing.
Owing to the prominence of the victims
of the tragedy the entire city is In
mourning and the river banks are lined
with throngs of people.'

man of Chicago, # who was camping at

, LIAOYANG. May 15.â The Russian
attack on one of the Japanese cruisers
was carefully planned while the Japa
nese squadron was concentrated out
side Dalny devoting its whole'attention
to Talienwan Bay, and was carried out
at night. .
The attacking force was not a regu
lar torpedo-boat, but was only a small
naphtha launch in command of a young
naval officer, who had with him three
jackies. The launch ' mounted a- small
machine gun and carried three torpe
does. .
When darkness fell the launch crept
outof Port Arthur, hugging.the shore,
with no lights aboard. It was late when
she^gajned; the outer line of- tÂ£e : .:Japa- .
nfi?e..Bqnadrpa.' -'.Sliuping^jJjjrt'Ush the
torpedo-boat pickets and selecting the
nearest warship.- a big armored cruiser,
she stole toward her and succeeded in
exploding, against her side a single tor
pedo. ' . v
Immediately flames enveloped the
cruiser. v which evidently was badly
crippled. The crew of the cruiser was
seen to be fighting the fire, which they
at last succeeded in extinguishing. A
sister ship *ook the damaged vessel in
tow and disappeared to the southeast.
The launch escaped the hot fire di
rected against her by the Japanese
ships, but was unable to return to Port
Arthur.
Only a few of the higher officers were
aware of the plan. The achievement
raised the spirits of the Russians afloat
and ashore, and the young officer who
was the hero of the exploit was feted
and recommended for the Cross of St.
George.
The Russians on May 11, apprehend
ing that the presence of a Japanese
squadron meant an attempt to capture
Dalny. blew up the piers and evacu
ated the place.
Two thousand Japanese have reoccu
pied the road to Sanchilipu, again cut

SANTA CRUZ, May 15. â One of the
important matters to come before the
convention and the decision of which
/hay settle the results on every issue,
'is that of proxies. Many of the coun
try delegations are, not completely rep
resented in person, but in most in
stances proxies are in the inside pock
ets of those who are on hand.
In some few cases the instructions
issued in the call for the election of
delegates to the convention was lived
up to. Those instructions state that
no proxies would be allowed, and, in
a few instances, proxies were not pre
pared. The new primary law apply
ing to .the larger , cities was supposed
by many sections to be applicable to
the entire State.
Had that belief been correct those
who do attend the convention would
be allowed to cast the vote of the en
tire delegation, no' matter how many
delegates are -absent. It is now con
tended that the right to cast the bal
lots of all the absent delegates by
those. who are present is up to the
convention to . decide, as is also the
"recognition of the proxies. The ques
tion will be fought out on the floor. â¢ â¢
PROXIES ARE IN DEBATE.

SAN FRANCISCO NOT NEEDED.
One delegate from the Bay City was
brave enough to stand and announce
that he thought San Francisco was all
right and would line up properly. Thia
little soeech did not seem to enthuse
the members to any great extent and
Tarpey again announced that the San
Francisco delegation was not needed to
win the fight for Hearst.
When the last county had been called
and the last response delivered. Chair
man Tarpey, after glancing at his
figures a moment, said:
"Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to In
form you that this caucus here to-night
demonstrates that we will control the
convention by a handsome majority.
We will control the convention and
carry our point even though every dele
gate from San Francisco vote3 against
us. > =.'
"But there is one point I want trÂ»
strongly impress upon you. I want you
to know that "William T. Jeter is our

vention and I ask that you stand by
him as loyally In the convention to
morrow as you have and will bv our/
candidate for the Democratic nomina
tion for President of the United States.
William R. Hearst."
Each side is confident of victory.

sixty. The opponents of instruction
offer to wager money that Gould will
be chosen chairman of the convention.

will call the delegates to order at tire

SANTA CRUZ. May 15. â The ac
tion of the San Francisco dele
gates will decide the issue in the
Democratic State Convention. The
| forces of Hearst, under the leader 4 
j ship of M. F. Tarpey. count on the
support of this delegation. Without
this support the resolution to send an
Instructed delegation to the National

Should the solid delegation of 168

friends would be badly demoralized.
Such alignment would make 371, a ma

of fifty-nine delegates is not placed in
the foregoing alignment. Several of
the small delegations are known to
be neutral. The opponents of Instruc

as a candidate for chairman of the
convention did not come to me in a
deilnite way. Consequently I cannot
pay at this time what iny answer will
bo when the request is definitely made
lo me, if it is made.
"Yes, there are some conditions under
\i hich I would refuse to become a can
tiidate for the honur of chairman of
the convention, but Just what these con
ditions are I do run care to say. There
is a possibility of my becoming a dele-
Kate to the National Convention. I can
say that I have already declined this
Iior.or; that is I have told some of my
fjiends that have laid the matter be
*fcre me that I did not care to under
take the journey or the responsibility,
in view of the present condition of my
heaith. which is not of the best."
'Mr. Jeter, though he did not make a
positive statement to the effect that
lie would become the candidate of the
Ilear.st delegates, was careful not to
utter a positive statement to the op
posite effect. This leaves the infer
ence plain that he is waiting until the
political atmosphere clarifies somewhat
before positively declaring himself.
Should the anti-instruction delegates
rally to-morrow the strength they now
threaten, it is possible Mr. Jeter will
decline to permit his name to go be
fore the convention.
Notwithstanding Mr. Jeter's state
ment that no definite request had been
made to him that he become the can
didate of the pro-instruction delegates
for chairman, M. F. Tarpev, after the
' adjournment of tho Hearst caucus,
said: "Of course, Mr. Jeter has griver.
his consent to have his name pro before
the eonyer.tlon as the candidate for
rhairman of the pro-in5truction forces.
We would not have used his name here

OHIO REPUBLICANS AT SEAi
Dratli of Senator Hanna Leaves State
Convention Without Leader.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. May 15.â The Re
publican State Convention meets here
next Tuesday and Wednesday under
the new conditions. This is due to the
loss of Senator Hanna, who had at
tended the gatherings for a score of
years and dominated them for the last
decade. This year no one is supremely
master, and in place of Hanna there is
a group of leaders.'
There are $51 delegates in the conven
tion. A large majority is affiliated with
what is called 'The Old Hanna Guard,"
rind there is no doubt about the con
vention being controlled by Governor
Herrick. Georce B. Cox and Senator
Dick, who, with Senator Foraker, will
be the delegates at large to the Repub
lican National Convention at Chicago.
The principal contention is for con
tinuance of control of the party organi
zation, and it is conceded that Gov
ernor Herrick, who will be both tem
porary and permanent chairman of the
convention, will be re-elected as the
Ohio member of the National Com
mittee and that Senator Dick will bÂ»
re-elected chairman of the State Ex
ecutive Committee, so that the old
Hanna organization is assured of con
tinuance. What iÂ« called the "Old
Hanna Guard" will name the ticket
and the delegates, the latter including
Senator Foraker "for the sake of har
mony and in deference to President
Roosevelt." The "organization men"
will write the platform. The only "free
for-all" races will be for alternates at
large and minor places on the State
ticket.

The story is creating considerable ad

SANTA CRUZ, May 15.â With tho
arrival to-night of the balance of the
Los Angeles delegation comes a scan
dal. It is openly charged that many of
the delegates made the trip to Santa
Cruz and will return to their homes on
free passes issued by the Southern Pa
cific
The momentous question of the right
of the band to exist will be settled to
morrow. The Hearst managers say it
shall not play within the walla of thÂ»
convention hall. The citizens- commit
tee of Santa Cruz says it will play be
tween the efforts of the Bou-bon ora
tors; that what Is crootL-cnough for the
foremost citizens of Santa Cruz com
posing the committee is Rood enough
for the flower of the State's Demo
cracy. Th<*re is the rub.
Not long ago this band accompanied
the Santa Cruz committee on its tour
of the State to advertise this city by
the sea. It suited the committee ad
mirably, but to-day when it drew near
the headquarters of William Randolph
Hearst, even the unveiled compliment
that rolled out with the tune "Hail to
the Chief" failed to appease the man
agers of the editor's campaign. The
order went forth that the band with
draw from the neighborhood of the sa
cred precincts. Somewhat astonished,
but surrendering none of its dignity,
the band made measured retreat down
the streets of the city to the beach.
For the rest of the day its tunes swept
out over the sad and solemn sea. whllÂ«
on the esplanade young couples, arm
in arm, walked to Its measured har
mony.
SANTA CRUZ. May 15.--Enterpris
ing citizens of this city, learned in the
ways of hospitality but ignorant as to
the number of political parties William
Randolph Hearst and his adherents are
flirting with, threw the asplrtngr edit
or's headquarters into convulsions to
day. Anxious to entertain the vlsitins
delegates to the convention to the ut
most limit, the Santa Cruz citlaens'
committee employed a band, an aggre
gation of musicians whose harmonies
are of purest tone but of "unfair"
brand. It is a non-union band that
knows no affiliation and owes no alle
giance but to the Government and the
flag. It is the band of the Thirteenth
United States Infantry, stationed at
Angel Island â a band more used to the
battle march than to the tunes that
still the heaving Democratic breast.
Continucd From Page 1. Column 7.
.When San Francisco was called. Tar
pey immediately arose and frankly ad-
Â¦ Sacramento" 'came out strong with
twenty-six for Hearst, and Solano will
give him nine. San Diego forces are
also united for him, but Trinity, Modoc,'
Tehama, Napa, ! Nevada, Yolo, Yuba,
Trinity and Tuolumne did not respond.
The gentlemen from Orange ap
peared a little more noisy than the or
dinary delegates and every few mo
ments they announced their inten
tions of . supporting the man of their
choice. Marin will give five delegates
to the cause of Hearst and Mendocino
five. Merced is also unanimous for
him, while Placer was not there when
her name was called.
Alpine, Amador, Del Norte and
Butte were called- in the order with
the same result. Scouts were sent
around the hall to try and resurrect
some of the delegates from these
counties, but without success. Tarpey
after a pause decided to pass them for
the time being and proceed with the
regular order of business. Fresno
came out strong for Hearst. The
leader from the raisin county an
nounced with pride that the entire
twenty-one delegates -were lined up for
the Californian. This provoked quite
a little cheering and cries of "Give us
a few more like Fresno!" greeted the
announcement. The name of Los An
geles was next called, Tarpey explain
ing that the delgateg from that county
having just arrived from the south,
were tired and weary and wanted to
seek their beds.
The spokesman from the southland
announced that the delegates stood 49
for Hearst and 6 against him. When
Humboldt was called, there was not
a word and the name of that county
was thrown aside. Orange seems to
be the banner county for Hearst in
point of enthusiasm. All her dele
gates, nine strong, are for him
and favor Jeter for chairman. It was
also given out that each and every
delegate from the county, had been
fully instructed.
ORANGE ENTHUSIASTIC.
The first county called was Alameda.
There was no response. Some one sug
gested that the Alameda delegates come
out of their hiding places and declare
themselves. Aftr a brief wait Tarpey
announced that the delegates from that
county were delayed, but he assured
every one that they were solid for
Hearst and that no one need have any
doubt as to the outcome.
ALAMEDA IS ABSENT.
Tarpey opened up the caucus at
10:25 with a vigorous speech. In which
he -suggested that past differences be
buried and forgotten, and that all good
Democrats unite and pull for Hearst.
He talked at length of burying the
hatchet and added that unity was the
only salvation.
In part he said: "Gentlemen, we are
gathered here to-night to show our
strength. We want Hearst for Presi
dent, and when I call the roll from the
different counties I want each delegatp
to respond and tell how his county
Stands. We do not want the whole of
Santa Cruz to know what is going on
at this meeting, and therefore I will ap
point Thomas Bohan of Sacramento
County sergeant-at-arms and Instruct
him to clear this hall immediately of
every outsider." Â»
This portion of Tarpey's speech did
not seem to meet with the approval of
those present. There was no cheering
evident. It was very much otherwise.
Some one in the back of the hall yelled
out, "Well, that's the way with you
fellows all the time. You're afraid to
let the public know what's doing. Why
don't you act openly and let us all have
a chance?" Cries of "That's right; let
It be an open meeting," followed this
abrupt remark. Tarpey was perplexed
for a moment^ but he finally yielded to
the popular sentiment and said: "Well,
as long as you seem to' favor an open
meeting we will conduct this caucus in
that way. Now, vhen I call the names
of the delegates from the different
counties I want them to come forward
and announce how they stand."
It was some time before the house
was in . order. The gathering seemed
anything but harmonious, the men got
up from their seats and stalked about
the hall evidently for want of some
thing better to do. Tarpey made re
peated calls for order and implored
those present to settle down to busi
ness and have the thing over with as
soon as possible.
TARPEY OPENS MEETING.
SANTA CRUZ, May 15.â The power
ful opposition that developed to-day
against the instruction programme
seemed to freeze the Hearst adherents
to the very marrow and the thaw had
not yet come when they assembled in
caucus at 10:25 to-night, in Odd Fellows'
Hall, on Pacific Ocean avenue. There
were not more than 200 delegates in the
hall and- among them was a liberal
sprinkling of anti-instruction delegates.
Enthusiasm of the simon-pure, 18-ka
rat Democratic type was absent. When
there was a cheer it was thin chested
and from some lonesome delegation
trying to impress upon the others thai
it was first and foremost in the battle
line. Speeches were many, but positive
statements few, while silence, start
llngly often to the Hearst managers,
followed the call for county delega
tions to announce their allegiance.
' When the poll was . over M. F. Tar
pey, manager of the Hearst campaign,
announced that the figures proved that
the fight was won, but he refused to
show the . figures. They were for his
private Information, he said, not for
general knowledge. The night before
his figures were for general distribu
tion. To-night it was apparent that
full confidence had flown, but his im
passive face gave no sign. He let the
delegates depart with the statement
ringing in their ears that the fight was
Â¦won.

Forty-Seven Delegates.
The following is a list of the delegates
to the convention as compiled by the
secretary of the Democratic State Cen
tral Committee: .
and it is even said openly that some of
the delegation are looking for more
substantial reward than mere passes.
Several of the delegates from Los
Angeles are exhibiting their regularly
purchased tickets since the story was
circulated, but those having passes are
not anxious to display their transporta
tion. The anti-Hearst people are mak
ing capital of the affair and it is more
than likely that the matter will be
referred to in the convention.
The Los Angeles delegation organ
ized to-night by electing A. S. Petter
son chairman and Walter Horgan sec
retary. Both officers are anti-Hearst
men and their election is considered a
good omen as to the final outcome.
While Los Angeles is looked upon as a
split delegation, Hearst is said to have
the majority of the votes. The Sonoma
delegation of twenty-one, all against
instruction, will caucus at 9 a. m.
to-morrow. /

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, .MONDAY, MAY 16, 1904.
So far as the light for chairman of the convention is concerned it is the desire of those that oppose
Instruction that the man that holds the gavel shall be fair and impartial. The opponents of instruction will
insist that they be given full representation on all committees and that their right to be heard in the con
vention shall not be abridged. This will be insisted upon and without doubt the point will be won. As to
the convention adopting a platform, all it can do is to adopt a general outline or matters it believes
should be contained in the national platform. The Democrats of California have many well denned opin

and these may be set forth in resolutions. This convention should adopt a resolution upon the irrigation ques
tion â a very vital question to California. However, any resolution this convention may pass will not be au
thoritative. It will merely be an expression of the desires of the Democrats of California, but doubtless it
will have its effect, which is the desire of all those that will take part in the deliberations that begin to
morrow. . FRANKLIN K. LANE.
IT seems to me now almost beyond question that the convention will not indorse any candidate and will
send an entirely free delegation to the National Convention' at St. Louis.- As to who the delegates will be
there has been little discussion, this question at the nresent time not being so important as that of the
effort that is being made to tie up under definite instruction those that are finally selected. However,
Mr. Geary and Mr. Doekweiler have been most frequently mentioned for the honor* of delegates at large .
and they must be considered as having formidable backing. At the caucus In San Francisco 280 delegates
were represented and those that represented them realize that any situation that may present itself at Stl
Louis will have to be met at the time It arises. Hence it is the general desire of at least the country dele
gates to tills, the State Convention, that men best qualified to act in the interests of .the State and the
Democratic party be sent there.
FREE DELEGATION IS EXPECTED.

WASHINGTON, May 15. â The re
port that President and Mrs. Roosevelt
attend different churches was one of
the features of a sermon delivered this
morning by Rev. Dr. W. E. Parsons of
the Church of the Reformation. The
minister counseled his flock not to fol
low the example set by the head of
the nation and the first lady of the
land.
The day was the silver anniversary
of ', the pastor's ministry over the
church, which is one of the princ5pal
Lutheran churchen of the city.
"There are plenty of people In this
city who will testify that the pastor
of this church has told them not to
join his congregation," said Dr. Par
sons in speaking of the growth of
the church and of its organization.
"Notwithstanding the example of the
President of the United States, a man
and his wife had better go to one
church! On that principle the pastor
of this church has done his work."
As is well known, the President at

CONVENTION OF Y. M. C. A.
Events up to date have demonstrated
that the delegates to the convention, to
a greater extent than has ever been the
case before, are loyal to the candidates
in whose interest they were selected,
and are not easily led or shifted about
by the generally recognized party lead
ers. The convention will reassemble at
2 p. m. to-morrow.
SPRINGFIELD, 111.. May 15.â It
looks to-night as if there would be at
least another day of fruitless balloting
before the Gubernatorial deadlock in
the Republican State Convention is
broken. It is quite possible that a
break will come early to-morrow after
noon, but the developments of to-day
do not Justify any such prediction. A
small number of the delegates remain
here, most of them having gone home
for Sunday, but the candidates and
their trusted advisers remain on the
ground and numerous conferences have
been held during the day. It Is known
definitely that desperate efforts are be
ing made to take from the Yates col
umn enough delegates to nominate
Lowden on an early ballot to-morrow.
There is now no probability that a
"dark horse" will be chosen. Indeed,
the choice Is generally regarded as be
ing between Yates, Lowden and Dl
neen.

SAN MATEO, May 15. â The Tala

score of 14 to 7 in favor of the home
team. This is the third time this sea
son that these two teams have met,
the San Franciscos winning both
of the other games. Since the last
game, however, the Talagoos have
been tremendously strengthened by
the addition of Tom McLaughlin. who
as a field captain is unsurpassed, and
his son Frank, both of whom former

ST. LOUIS. May 15.â The total at
tendance at the World's Fair for the
second week, ending Saturday night,
showed an increase of over 50,000 over
the total attendance for the opening
week. The totals show a larger attend
ance for the second week of the Colum
bian Exposition, but it is taken into
consideration that no excursions have
been run to bring in visitors and the
attendance at present is largely local,
and also that the population of Chicago
far exceeds that of St. Louis.
The National Editorial Association
convention will begin to-morrow in
Congress Hall at the exposition, to con
tinue during the week. The World's
Press Parliament will convene on
Thursday, and It Is estimated that the
total attendance of newspaper men for
the two conventions will number about
3000 from all parts of the world. Al
most every press association and news
organization of the United States will
be represented. The Federation cf
Women's Clubs will hold its biennial
convention here this week, beginning
on Tuesday, and the National Good
Roads Association will hold Its annual
convention this week, beginning to
morrow.
McKinley and Peuter are supposed
to have made more than $100,000 out
of their .alleged illicit transactions in
timber lands. Both lived extravagant
ly and when they were apprehended
they readily furnished large sums for
their release and employed the best
legal counsel In the State for the de
fense of themselves and the two
women charged jointly with them.
The Portland case contains some
picturesque features. Miss Marie Ware
is one of the prettiest girls in Oregon.
Her father was United States Court
Commissioner at Eugene in this State
and was highly esteemed. At his
death two years ago she was orphaned
and without means. Formerly she had
clerked in her father's office and was
conversant with details of the work.
Out of pity for her helpless position
and at the request of many prominent
people of Oregon she was appointed
United States Court Commissioner in
her father's stead and proceeded to fill
the duties.
She met McKinley, who is accused
of timber frauds, and fell in love with
him. He is said to have converted her
into a ready tool in the conversion of
spurious homestead claims into timber
entries and is said to have induced her
to certify to the genuineness of these
in her official capacity. When the
Government finished its investigation
it was concluded that she was crimin
ally conversant with the forgery of a
large number of "dummy" names and
she was taken into custody. She is
now at liberty under heavy bonds.
Emma Watson, the other woman de
fendant in the case, is said to have
lived with Peuter in Portland as his
wife under the aliases of Mr. and Mrs.
Porter. She was one of the persons
who signed affidavits that she had oc
cupied a homestead "subsequently de
clared by the Government to be a for
est reserve. When the investigation
was commenced the Watson woman
disappeared, but was subsequently lo
cated in Chicago by that wonder of the
United States secret service force, Wil
liam J. Burns, and sent back to Port
land. She "also is under heavy bonds
pending the hearing. Peuter has a
family In Aiameda, who are not yet
apprised of his relations with the Wat
son woman. i
PORTLAND, Or., May 15.â Next
Wednesday morning the trial of A. S.
B. Peuter, G. McKinley Miss Marie
Ware and Miss Emma Watson will be
commenced in the Federal court. They
â¢ are jointly charged with defrauding
' the United States of large tracts of
| timber land by frogery and false rep
! resentation. An effort was made by
Â¦. the prosecution to obtain a postpone
i ment for thirty days, but this was re
i fused.
To-day United States Attorney Frost
i telegraphed to Francis J. Heney of San
! Francisco that the trial would begin
! Wednesday and an aswer was received
that Heney would leave San Francisco
on the Portland express at 7 o'clock
to-night. Heney has been appointed
I as special prosecutor in the timber
I frauds case by Attorney General
Knox. He has also conducted the
trials of Dimond and Hyde in San
Francisco by special appoinmtnet of
the Attorney General of the United
States.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 15.
âRev. Bishop Daniel A. Goodsell de
livered the baccalaureate sermon in
Memorial Church this morning before
the members of the graduating class
and the faculty alumni and students
of the university. The service was very
impressive. After the audience was
seated the class of 1904 marched in
slowly and occupied seats directly in
front of the members of the faculty.
The women all wore the black cap and
gown, but the men appeared without
this classic garb.
Bishop Goodsell spoke shortly and
directly. He took his text from Corin
thian, chapter thirteen, eleventh verse:
"When I was a child I spoke as a child,
I understood as a child, I thought as a
child: but when I became a man I put
away childish things." He urged the
class members to be simple and up
right in their life and to carry the
spirit of the Creator with them through
success or defeat.

THOSE WHO COME BEFORE.
An important matter of business to
come up for consideration during the
club convention will be the report of
the committee appointed at the San
Jcse convention two years ago to draft
a plan for putting the league on
a financial basis. Hitherto the local
clubs throughout the State have con
tributed nothing toward the expenses
of the State League. These have been
borne chiefly by the pincers. It is
understood that the committee, of
which Senator G. R. Lukens of Ala
meda is chairman, will report in fa
for of an assessment, to be paid into
the league treasury by each of the
constituent clubs. This assessment
may be put on a per capita basis or
may be a fixed sum for all clubs alike,
as the league shall decide when the
report is acted upon.

months-old baby through the head
three times as it lay in its cradle, and
then, lying down on the floor, placed

LIAOYANG,' May 15.â Chinese sol

only partly clad. The Chinese looted
the works and retired.
CHINESE BAXDITS KILLED.
LIAOYANG, Saturday, May 14 (de
layed in transmission). â Chinese ban
dits are becoming bolder and are caus
ing much trouble to the Russian out
posts. A swarm of the bandits at noon
of May 13 attacked the coal mines on
the branch line east of Yangtsai sta
tion, ten miles north of Liaoyang.
The mines, which supply the whole
railroad, were guarded by 200 riflemen
and 100 Cossacks. In a fierce fight the
Russians defeated the bandits and then
charged them, the bandits flying to the
hills and to three neighboring villages.
The troops surrounded the villages and
demanded the surrender of the bandits.
This was at first refused, but fears that
the Russians would destroy their homes
caused the villagers to reveal finally
the hiding places. The bandits fought
with the desperation of entrapped rats
and fifty of them were killed. The Rus
sians suffered no loss.
Among seventeen prisoners taken by
the troops were two Japanese officers
who had escaped from the Russians.
One of the bandits taken prisoner con
fessed that the bandits had been hired

The association supplied students
with 159 places during the year. Some
idea of the demands may be gained
from the statement that there were 263
applications' for places, so that all could
not be supplied. The cash value to the
students of these 159 places is conserva
tively fixed at 55183. Twenty-seven ap
plications were received for places as
dishwashers and cooks, though only
ten were supplied. There were thirty
one applications for waiters' places,
half of them being supplied, the value
being $1750. Berkeley housewives used
thirty-one students to help them clean
house and gave them $140, and thirteen
students took care of horses and milked
cows. Besides these menial places many
other positions were filled by students
as clerks and canvassers. Â»
Some interesting figures dealing with
the student labor problem are shown in
the annual report of the Young Men's

Mayor Warren Olney, George Dor
nin, president of the City Council;
Councilman Pendleton and other
municipal authorities are working in
defatigably to have the bond election
held on or before June 20, and it will
not be for want of energy if this plan
is defeated. Numerous details are re
tarding the work, but there' will be
no diminution in the efforts of the
city's officers to have the election
called at the earliest possible date.
Much work has already been done
by those who are directing matters
and much zest is being shown in
clearing away the balance of the de
tails.
Among the things yet remaining for
the Council to do Is passing the neces
sary ordinances relative to the pro
posal to pave all of the cross walks
of the city with bitumen at a cost
of $127,000. This matter was inserted
in the proposed bonding scheme at the
instance of Mayor Olney and is con
sidered a most Important matter in
the general plan of beautifying the
streets of Oakland.
It is necessary to change the de
scription of Sather tract and also of
the children's playground at Fifth and
Adeline streets before the bonds will
be ready for submission. This work
has been practically completed by the
City Engineer. The bond committee
is also to report on the advisability
of including in the bond issue the
improvement of the East Side sewer,
at a~ cost of $41,000, and also the out
let sewer for Twenty-first avenue, at
a cost of $10,000. There is before the
committee the matter of putting in a
culvert In Temescal Creek, near Clin
ton street.
When the matters above referred to
are finally disposed of the entire bond
ing'plan will be in readiness to sub
mit to the voters. Mayor Olney has
already signed the most important of
the ordinances, leaving only the minor
matters yet tp be considered.
Plans for the new city hall have
already been submitted to the bond
committee by Architect John Galen
Howard. Tlfc^e plans are merely a
crude outline as yet, and were drawn
to comply .with the law requiring that
all of the matter going into the bond
issue be accompanied by plans and
specifications. In adopting the plans
of Mr. Howard the Council does not
bind : itself to follow them, but may
change them at pleasure.
A number of ordinances relative to
the bonds will be passed on to-morrow
night by the Council.

Chief Marshal Bates requests that
the drivers of all automobiles, which
will form the third division of the par
ade, run their machines south along
Broadway to Eighth street, thence over
to the west side of Clay, street, where
the division will make up. He wants
this done to lessen the danger of the
automobiles in scaring horses attached
to the division of vehicles that will
form ahead of the automobiles. _
To-day those who have automobiles
and other vehicles entered in the par
ade were busily employed in decorating
them and the display of ornamented
automobiles is expected to surpass any
exhibition of its kind vet witnessed
here. Flqwers will be elaborately
utilized in all of the decorations. Many
of the stores along the line of the
parade have been decorated with flags
and bunting.
The parade will be formed as fol
lows:
Oakland means to make the advent
of a second great transcontinental rail
road a memorable occasion. C. D. Bates
Jr., chief marshal of to-morrow's
street demonstration, was kept busy
to-day receiving additional entries of
wheeled affairs, from large auto tour
ing cars to pony carts. He figured
this afternoon that there would be
more than one hundred flower bedecked
vehicles in the line of march. These
will include automobiles, bicycles, two,
four and six horse rigs, floats, traps
and carts. .
OAKLAND, May 15.â When the first
transcontinental train rumbles into
Oakland over the Santa Fe to-day
Governor Pardee will welcome it in be
half of the commonwealth. The Gov
ernor will be in the parade and will
speak at the new depot at San Pablo
avenue and Fortieth street. The floral
parade will start promptly at 9:30 a, m.
from Eighth and Broadway and will
meet the pioneer train, that is sched
uled to arrive at the depot at 10:35. The
train is known as No. 41 and is coming
from New Orleans. When it reaches
Fortieth street addresses will be made
by representative citizens of Oakland
and Emeryville and by officials of the
Santa Fe line.
After the speechmaking the parade
will go to the Emeryville racetrack,
where the decorated vehicles will be
Judged and prizes awarded. Automobile
and bicycle races and athletic contests
will follow.
Many inquiries for property in North
Oakland have been made of J. J: Lay
mance & Co. This firm recently
sold three pieces of property to Eastern
people and is counting on several more.
Mr. Laymance, the senior member of
the firm, predicts a rapid growth in
Oakland now, not only on account of
Eastern settlers but because of the in
crease in the number of business enter
prises.
"The coming of the Santa Fe is mak
ing history," he says, "and helping us
lay a foundation for a great city. Oak
land is growing along solid and sub
stantial lines and this is manifest
on every side. We really have now
a trading population of 230,000 people,
counting all our country backing."
Laymance & Co. have just sold
a big piece of property in North Oak
land for $21,000, the purpose of the
owners being to sell it in lots. The
firm also sold to Dr. Tuntington and
Dr. Stratton for $25,000 the lot at the
corner of Telegraph avenue and
Twentieth street.
From Berkeley comes news of a tract
that has suddenly been seized upon as
one of the most desirable locations in
the town for residences. It had been
almost overlooked until lately, but its
many advantages have been noticed
by intending purchasers and now many
lots are being bought. The property
lies along the foothills, ten blocks
above the university grounds. It is
picturesque, full of grand old oak trees
and commands a grand view of the bay.
Among those building homes in the
section are Professor Jacques Loeb of
the university, who has contracted for
an $8000 house at Virginia street and
Le Roy averrue; Professor John Galen
Howard, supervising architect for the
university, a home on Ridge RoaC,
near Mrs. Phoebe Hearst's home, to
cost $15,000; Mrs. B. H. Blossom, corner
Ridge Road and Le Roy avenue, $3500;
Mr. Freeman of San Francisco, house
just finished, Ridge Road and Le Roy
avenue, 520,000; Frank Armstrong,
home, corner Euclid avenue and Vir
ginia street; Mrs. Evelyn A. Ratcllffe
and Mrs. Scott, houses on Euclid
avenue; Miss Edith Bauerhyte, con
tracted for house on Arch street near
Cedar; Miss Irene Coil of Woodlawn.
a home on Le Roy avenue to cost $6000.
. These and a large number of other
purchases in this district show the
movement toward that direction of
the town.
The demand for suburban residence
property on this side of the bay keeps
up with remarkable briskness. This
obtains more in North Oakland, Berk
eley and Alameda than anywhere else.
It seems that Eastern people are a good
deal interested In these cities since
many of them are being attracted here
by the chances for business enterprise.
Naturally, many of Uum prefer to live
in a suburban city than a big city and
so they select the place that appeals
most to the-m.

PRESENT FAMOUS "EVERYMAN"
CE.NTERVlLLE,May 15.â Centcrville
is going to hold a. Fourth of July cele
bration, in which all of the lower part
of Alameda County and the northern
part of Santa Clara County will Join.
This has been decided by a committee
of enthusiastic and interested citizens,
and sub-committees are already out
working up the details.
It was thought advisable by the peo
ple of Centerville to discuss the ques
tion of holding an all-day, celebration
<_-f the national holiday, aa was done
two years ago. At that time all of the
residents of Washington and Murray
and a considerable portion of Eden
townships united to make the Center
ville celebration a success. The many
different towns of this section were
again communicated with, and the gen
eral opinion was that Centerville would
be the proper place in which to again
wave Old Glory and make the Ameri
can eagle scream.
The result was that a committee has
been organized, with F. T. Hawes, the
Postmaster of this town, as chairman
and J. J. O'Keefe as secretary. Every
citizen ot Centerville is a member of
the committee to make the affair a
pucce??.
There will be a baseball game in the
liKirnir.g. a good, old-fashioned oration
and then a barbecue. In the afternoon
there will be racing, athletic events
and daylight fireworks, to be followed
by the regular kind of fireworks and a
bi>ll in the evening.
There is no jealousy between the dif
ferent towns in the district and all
have united to make this a success.
Supervisor Homer, who lives in Center
ville, has promised his aid, and the i>eo
1'le- of lrvington. Mission Pan Jose.
Warm Springs, Kites. Decoto, Alva
rado. Newark, Mount Eden and ail
other parts of the lower section of Ala
meda County are aiding in the work.
Bishop Fowler then described at
length the towers of the city. The
citadel, the goal for men, he pointed
out, is the holy book. Another tower
he called unity, this standing for the
strength and power of the book. More
than forty men were the authors,
whose works extended over 1500 years,
yet there Js the everlasting tide of
revelation running through the writ
ings. All this points to a master hand.
The ceremonies closed with the sing
ing of another selection by the De
Koven Quartet and the pronouncing
of the benediction by the Rev. Mr.
Parsons.
Prom the towers of the city we may see
the yonder. We look down beneath and see
liow our defenses may be strengthened. We
fortify oursplvcs, if we will, for the morrow,
for the resurrection. There is a guide to take
Â¦us up thÂ»-re. if we will follow. A tiny bee has
a brain that Â¦will carry him back to the hive
he has left miles behind in the search for
honey. Now who pave him the compass? Who
Is his fruide? Will he not guide nÂ»o? The birds
migrate and live in perpetual summer. There
1> an everlasting feast set brfore them. Who
glides them? Will he guide me, too?
Out of our bodies we make the moat of the
walled city. And you will understand more
fully my drift when I say that so much has
it-'fn done for our bodies morally and spirit
ually and physically that we can make more.
It is constructed for defense. The vital organs
are walled in so that we cannot get at them.
The works are all stowed away In a nutshell.
The bo'ly la constructed in many ways to me't
our demands. There is a strange thoughtful-
Den about it all. We are put at our best in
this body. And I want to say that it is the
l>est known body, the best thinkable body and
the best possible body.
Now then whÂ»n so much is bestowed upon
the body we have a right to expect to make
more of It. It is not for us to abuae this
temple. It is given to us to improve and de
velop.
By saints 1 ra-an such men as William Me-
Klnlejr. who died In the faith. There is a
story of an agnostic who disbelieved until he
read of ilcKin'.ey's cloriGus death. And then
be said: "I am persuaded that I am wrong."
1 know of a doctor of Philadelphia who knew
of twenty infidels who gave up their infidelity
to live alter the ideals of William McKinley.
The walls of the ancient city furnlphr-d the
n>cÂ»1e of â¢Jrfense. On this continent there are
only two relic* of thÂ«> old walled cities. Of.
the old walls of Quebec little- remains, and
ttill ltss of Augustine in the South. Hut
on the other side of the watT. in China, there
are more than 1000 walled cities, built for
the defense of its people. The walls of
Zicn were buljt from out of the works of the
Mints. And the works of the saints were
founded on the gospel. So that now we have
a fair tost of the efficacy or the Kos-pel. If
the gospel saves live* it never can be super
annuated. If it fails, the sooner it becomes
eu!*rannuated she better.
Bishop CharliÂ»s Henry Fowler of Buf
falo, New York, preached the bacca
laureate sermon to the graduating class
of the University of California this
afternoon in the Greek theater. The
seniors and hundreds of their friends
defied the heat of the day and crowded
into the shade of the great classic pile.
It was altogether a solemn occasion
and the words of the venerable Bishop
fcll # upon eager ears.
President Wheeler presided and on
either side of him sat Bishop Fowler
and Kev. E. L. Parsons, rector of St.
Mark's Episcopal Church. They were
appropriately arrayed in the academic
cap and gown." The Rev. Mr. Parsons
delivered the praj'er, after the services
had been opened by a song: by the De
Koven Quartet. President Wheeler then
read from the scriptures and, following
another song. Bishop Fowler was intro
duced, who said in part:

Special Dispatch to The Call
The number of candidates for bish
opric honor* frrows daily, and no less
than thirty-five names are now men
tioned in this connection. It is not pos
sible to forecast at this time the prob
ab'.e successful a spirants.
It is quite likely that the election of
eijrht. possibly more. Bishops will take
j;Jace during the present week. The
day has not been decided upon, but it is
penerally believed that it will be
Wednesday or Thursday.
Other matters that will come before
the conference this week are: Action
of the Methodist church up'wj aivorce:
consolidation of the various branches of
the Book Concern; limit the tenure of
pastorates; placing the church on rec
ord in the matter of amusements, viz.:
dar.cinp, card piayinpr. theater going,
or., and many other matters that have
been brought up in memorials from
district conferences.
Eerraons by the following' Bishops
were preached to-day: Bishop H. W.
Warren, at Boyle Heights M. B.
Church; Bishop D. H. Moore, Centen
nial M. E. Church; Bishop F. W.
W&r^e. Boyle Heights, evening; Bishop
J. H. Vincent, at Vincent M. E. Church,
where dedicatory ceremonies were held;
Bishop Earl Cranston, Blanchard's
Hall; Bishop Joseph C. Hartzell, First
Mr E.'. Church, Pa.sadena.
All other Methodist pulpits In the city
end many of other denominations were
occupied by visiting clergymen. At the
First M. E. Church, this city. Dr. Jo
Â¦ eeph Berry led e large evangelical mass
meeting, and at the Simpson Audito
(Huni Dr. Frank Mason North, George
I\ Hckir.an and J. W. Bashford made
.addresses to a large crowd.
â Hazard's Pavilion was crowded to
overflowing in the afternoon to listen
to a sermon by the Rev. Dr. Waddy
Moes, fraternal delegate from the Meth
t ,odist church in England, and at the
came place this evening there was a
rneeting of the Woman's Home Mission
ary Society.
The happenings at yesterday's session
cf the General Conference, when a vote
was taken upon the retirement of five
c Bishops, furnished a live topic of dis
'cussiqn among the delegates to-day.
There' is no doubt In the minds of the
delegates that when the vote is report
ed to-morrow morning it will enow a
decided majority in favor of the report
â¢'of the episcopacy committee reeom
m'ending the retirement of Bishops
Vincent, Walden, Andrews, Mallalieu
itnd Foes. The prompt and determined
hianner in which the subject was put
through the conference yesterday, in
the face of strong effort to postpone
definite action until Monday, was much
commented upon. There are a certain
number of delegates, especially among
the laymen, who are disposed to criti
cize the manner in which the five aged
Bishops were deprived of their high of
fice, "but the leaders seem to feel re
lieved that the most unpleasant duty of
the conference has been performed and
that the way Is now clear to talte up
other pressing and important legisla
tion.
LOS ANGELES, May 15.â To-day was
welcomed by the delegates to the Meth
odist General Conference as a day of
rest, after a week of continuous ees
clor.s either of the conference or of the
various committees. While enough vis
iting Bishops and ministers volunteered
their services to the pulpit supply com
mittee to fill every Protestant pulpit in
the city and suburban towns, at both
morning and evening services, the
great body of the delegates rested end
talked over the events of. yesterday 'Â¦
eeasion of the conference.

"Why did Mrs. Burdette decline to
let her name stand before the bien
nial?" This is the question in all club
dom. When The Call announced her
wired declaration telephones got busy
all over town asking for confirmation.
Here were the delegates, with grips
packed, ready to start East carrying
Instructions to vote for Mrs. Burdette,
the California candidate. In fact, but
two Western women had been prom
inently mentioned for the honor â the
California candidate and Mrs. Sarah
Platt Decker of Colorado. It is an open
secret that many of the unpledged dele
pates admired Mrs. Decker exceedingly,
but patriotism soon decided the issue
and the clubwomen stood prepared to
show the politicians of California a few
things about "standing pat" on one
candidate and in boosting said candi
date, instead of knocking. But now,
unfortunately, this rare lesson is to be
denied them. Mrs. Burdette has de
clined at the eleventh hour to go be
fore the convention as a candidate, and
I There are to be morning, afternoon
I and evening sessions dealing with all
sorts of topics bv the leaders of the
work discussedâ by all but poor far
off California. Yes. frankly, California
with its 2S.000 clubwomen and 416 clubs
has not been given one place on the
programme.
Now that's a bad bit of manlpula
j tion on eomebojjy's part â riot to say
Ingratitude or lack of appreciation.
Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Col-
I orado and a few more rather
i provincial communities have been
! awarded several representations,
) but California with all her clever
! women is distinctly overlooked â that is,
I as far as platform courtesies have been
1 distributed. But somehow California
i has a happy way of always being on
j the ground smiling and debonnair and
â¢ not being an "also present." And
I thus will it be at the biennial. By a
I clever, but perfectly courteous and
permissible arrangement, California
will be heard from. How? Just
watch and see. .She'll carry her ora
torical banner as lofty as the older
j club States, even though she was
; omitted from the list of honors. Call-
J fomla has never figured in the sympa
i thetlc roll of Cinderella â it's too em
j barrassingjfor a strenuous State like
j ours. j
The State Federation will be repre
j sented by Mrs. George Law Smith, the
newly elected president. Tactful,
charming of speech and of manner,
high bred and a colonial dame in ap
| pearance as well as in fact, the State
j will have a striking representative.
Then she is ably flanked by the dele
' gates from all the clubs, more than 500
j â¢women having gone on from this State,
(among them the presidents of all our
! local clubs, besides the selected dele
j gates. And If they don't impress the
i Eastern sisterhood it will be because
I our women didn't get a chance "to get
: a word in." But they will, never fear.
j Our California women are pretty clever
j at "getting a word in" when they really
i want to.
St. Louis has been delivered Into the
hands of women from all over our
glorious country. And being club
women, they are the possessors of
ideasâ yes, and ideals-^on all things
moral, social, cultural, civic, altrustlc,
ethical, political and domestic.
To-morrow the convention convenes.
Mrs. T. S. Dennison of New
York will preside at the four days"
conference â she who won the national
presidenoy at the Los Angeles biennial
orer Mrs. Bob Burdette, who was
chosen for second place on the national
ticket.
At the regular monthly meeting of
the Outdoor Art League, held at the
residence of the president, Mrs. Lovell
White, Monday afternoon, May 9, the
members were entertained by. Mrs. Nel
lie Blessing Eyster, who talked of out
door art in Europe. Mrs. Eyster inter
ested her audience deeply as she pic
tured with exquisite grace the beauty
of Ireland, its verdant hills, its hedges,
woodlands and the decorative charm of
color produced â¢ by cultivated tracts.
The lecture was one of the rare pleas
ures of the month.
The x Papyrus Club held its regular
meeting for members only Thursday,
May 12, at 2:20 p. m., at its clubrooms,
Utopia Hall, 223 Sutter street. It was
French humor day. Mrs. A. C. GIrard
read a most instructive and amusing,
paper on French humor and humorists,
which was followed by French stories
by the members. The election of officers
and directors was held- and the follow
ing members were elected officers:
President, Mrs. C. Mason Kinne; first
vice president. Mrs. W. S. Leake; sec
ond vice president. Miss Ella V. Mc-
Closkey; secretary, Mrs. Louise Bat
tles Cooper; corresponding secretary.
Mrs. Henry Bergstein; treasurer, Mrs.
S. W. Backus; directorsâ Mrs. W. H.
Brown, Mrs. Samuel Bessinger, Mrs.
Kathryn Boyns, Mrs. W. W. Briggs and
Mrs. A.M. Ferguson.
The Phelomath Club', Mrs. Julius
Kahn president, held a red-letter day
last Monday, when Julius Kahn, the
ex-Congressman and ex-actor, address
ed the club upon "The ' Stage, tho
Actors, and a Few Other Things." Now.
If as clever a"n address has been heard
in the Phelomath this season, it is in
deed to be congratulated.
â¢ â¢ â¢
A delightful afternoon is assured to
those fortunate enough to hold guest
cards.
On Wednesday the Lauret Hall Club,
Mrs. Gevf'ge M. Haight president, will
hold a "regular meeting at 1620 Califor
nia street, at which the following pro
gramme will be carried out:
Installation of officers, by Mrs. Thos.
W. Collins; original writers, section
(programme in charge of Mrs. Ella M.
Sexton), stories by members of section;
a play. '"The Twentieth Century Lady
Helps," by Mrs. Ella M. Sexton.
Some splendid music was rendered by
Mrs. Erich Xeal, and by'a young Aus
tralian vocalist. Miss Gladys Ure, who,
by the way, composes much that she
sings.
Last Wednesday* the Forum Club
again distinguished itself by presenting
a smart programme. Miss Agnes G.
Murphy, the London journalist, who
with Miss Moore Is visiting in this oity,
talked in a delightful, reminiscent man
ner on "Side-lights of the Musical Pro
fession." She spoke at length of the
number of singers who flock yearly to
London â with more ambition than capi

the clubwomen have lost a neat little
opportunity of showing the men "a
good example." And that's one thing
a good clubwoman loves to do!
When the personnel law was passed
it was upon the specific understanding
that officers of the line could and would
familiarize themselves with engine
room duties and become all-around offi
cers of ships, but this scheme has fail
ed; few, if any of the line, have taken
kindly to engineering duties, while all
of the former engineers ranking with
and after lieutenants have qualified for
line duties, with the result that not
over seventy-five commissioned officers
are performing engineer duty at sea,
and this highly Important service is
mainly done by the corps of warrant
machinists selected for tnelr practical
knowledge of such duty.
The old engineer corps was estab
lished in 1842 and started with one en
gineer-in-chief, six chief engineers and
eighteen first, second and third assist
ant engineers. Only the engineer-in
chief was appointed by the President,
the others held their positions by "war
rants?." The number steadily Increased
until it reached 174 in I860, at which
time Its members had succeeded In ob
taining rank with other officers in the
navy. In, 1869. -through the efforts, of
Admiral Porter, this rank.was reduced
and designated as being relative only
with that of officers of the line. From
that time and until 1899 the engineer
corps fought far what Is considered its
proper J recognition in the navy and â¢ a
Theodore Ruggles Timby claims to
have invented the revolving turret,
such as was used on the Monitor in its
fight with the Merrimack in Hampton
Jtoads, March 8, 1862, and revolution
ized warship construction. He says
that in 1843 he filed a caveat in the
Patent Office at Washington for a
â¢'revolving tower for . offensive or de
fensive warfare, which could be used
on land or water." Mr. Timby has been
pressing his claim of $500,000 against the
United States Government for forty
years, and was recently assured that
the Court of Claims would probably
reach his case during the present year.
The claimant is eighty-three years of
age, but is still confident that he will
be awarded the sum asked for, as well
as the credit for the invention common
ly attributed to John Ericsson.
Secretary Moody's action In re-estab
lishing the engineer corps and organiz
ing a special ordnance corps is of de
cided benefit to the service and accepted
with general satisfaction by naval offi
cers. The personnel law of March, 1899,
which abolished the engineer corps and
transferred its officers to the line, has
proved a rank failure, and it will take
several, years to remedy the bad effects
of that illy-considered legislation. On
the July Register of 1899 there were 183
former engineer officers distributed
among the several grades of the line.
In January, 1904. this number has de
creased, by deaths, resignation and re
tirement, to 115, and of these twenty
four were available for shore duty only,
leaving 121 for shore and sea service.
Outcf this last contlgent, ninety-two
were at sea performing engineer or line
duty, and twenty-nine were on shore
duty or unemployed.
SCHEME PROVES A FAILURE.
At the British naval maneuvers
shortly to take place a large number
of soldiers will be sent on board the
several ships in order to get practical
instructions in the landing of troops,
embarkment of guns and their hand
ling and disposition on shore.
CHANGES IX CRUISER BATTERIES
Some very radical changes in -the
batteries of armored cruisers building
for the British navy are contemplated.
In the warrior class, designed to carry
four 9.2-inch in casemates and ten 6
inch in broadside at an elevation of
'fourteen feet above water, four 7.5-inch
guns are to take -the place of the 6-inch
and are tÂ« be placed on the upper deck
at a heisht of twenty-two feet above
the normal water line. The Devonshire
class is to have two 7.5-inch guns on
the upper deck substituted for the four
6-lnch as originally planned."
A new 2-inch quick-firing gun from
the Vickers* Sons and Magim Com
pany is to be introduced in the British
navy. *The cartridge is charged with
modified cordite and the gun, which
works with greater rapidity than any
other hitherto used, is fitted with au
tomatic sightt*.
The British armored cruiser Corn
wall, 9S00 tons, designed to steam 23
knots, averaged 24 kno'ts during her
speed trial of eight hours.
The Turkish Government Is so well
satisfied with the cruiser recently
built at Cramps' that it has ordered a
second vessel of the same type, to cost
$&50,000. The Medjidia Is of 3277 tons,
12,000 horse power and attained the de
signed speed of 22 knots. The Denevr
class of six protected cruisers in our
navy are of 3215 tons, 4700 horse power
and 16 1 " knots speed and their average
contract price was |1, 049.252, the high
est being $1,080,000 and the lowest $1,
027,000. Conceding that the expense of
wood sheathing and coppering a vessel
of that size adds considerable to her
cost, .this increase is more than offset
by theu"ar greater engine power in the
Turkish^ ship.
CLAIMS HE INVENTED TURRET.
The British armored cruiser Drake
has proved itself the fastest large war
vessel afloat, having recently made the
run from Portsmouth to Las Palmas, a
distance of over 1600 miles, at. an aver
age speed of 'twenty-four knots an hour.
Arriving on the West India station the
ship left Jamaica one Saturday evening
for Bermuda,* a run -of nearly 900 miles,
which she accomplished in less than
thirty-six hours. The Drake is one of
four armored cruisers of 14,100 tons,
and developed a speed of 23.05 knots
with 30,849 horsepower at her speed
trial of eight hours. All the cruisers of
this class are fitted with Belleville boil
ers, which seem to have given satis
factory results, except perhaps .as to
consumption. When these ships; were
first placed in commission they were
complained of as being almost unsea
worthy because of their rolling and
pitching propensities, and their machin
ery gave much trouble. These defects
appear to have been remedied by a re
arrangement of the battery and the en
gineer force becoming familiar with
their work. The reports regarding
these cruisers during the naval ma
neuvers last year were on the whole
satisfactory, and while the Drake holds
the championship for speed, the other
vessels are little, if any, inferior in that
regard.
It was believed that the disaster
which overtook the British submarine
boat, by which eleven lives were lost,
would have a bad effect on the crewa
of other submarines. In order to know
just to what extent this feeling existed
in the navy the Admiralty ordered ex
periments to be carried out with all the
completed boats. The officers were as
desirous as ever to go on with the work,
and volunteers were plentiful among
the crews. Only two bluejackets who
had been on board these craft lost their
nerve. A medical survey found that
they were incapacitated for such work
and they were discharged from the ser
vice.

compromise was reached by which the
corps ceased to exist and its former
members became officers of the line.
In order to compensate, to some extent,
for the loss of engineer officers, a corps
of warrant machinists was established
In 1899, and consisted of 100 members.
This has been raised to 150 with a
further authorization of twenty a year
as the President may consider needed
for the service. The new corps has
forsome time been preparing, notwith
standing G. W. lielville's disapproval,
to obtain better recognition and rank.
It is history repeating Itself. The
yearly increasing deficiency in commis
sioned and competent engineer officers
would in a few years raise the warrant
machinists corps to such' a number as
would exercise, the requisite influence
upon Congress to enact laws .that
would place the officers in charge of
engine rooms oryan equality with
other officers in the/navy, and it Is sur
mised that this u4'l grounded appre
hension has prompVd the advisers of
tfle Secretary of the Navy to re-es
tabltsh the engineer corps, the mem
bers of which will be graduates from
the Naval Academy, and thus exclude
warrant machinists from becoming
commissioned engineer officers.

"But I do not mind saying that I
have never seen a man this color be
fore," said one of the doctors; "never
anything like it. Cases 6f pigmentation
are not very rare, and arise from vari
ous diseases. But I have never seen a
man whose skin was so colored."
Goss has rapidly become an object of
great curiosity among the large hos
pital staff.â London Express.
The strangest case in the London |
Hospital at present is that of the white ]
man, Thomas Goss, who is gradually j
turning black. Â¦
Ke was taken there yesterday from !
the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum,!
where, as stated In yesterday's Ex
press, he has been an inmate for the
past three years.
He now lies at the end of a row of
patients in the Bedford Ward â an old,
decrepit man of sixty-six, with worn
face and emaciated hands, his skin of
a gray-black hue. looking like that of
a negro slightly bleached. His close
nopped hair is white, and he has a
thin white beard. His voice is very
weak, and he is partly deaf.
Thomas Goss was born in Bedford
shire, and about thirty years ago he
came to London to work as a laborer.
"I am very comfortable here," he said
to an Express representative, who
yesterday visited the bedside of the
biack- white man. "I have pains In my
legs, and it seems to catch me here," he
added, placing his hand on his side,
'but I am able to get about a bit. Only
I feel pretty weak."
Asked when his skin began to turn
color, he said, "It's more than three
years ago. I was working at Millwail
Docks. When the other men began to
tell me about my skin I came to the
London Hospital as. an out-patient as
long as I could. Then I got weak, and
had to go into the Sick Asylum, where
they did everything for me. but they
1 couldn't find out what was the matter.
"Any number of doctors used to come
there and see me, but they could never
find out what was wrong. Now I've
come here, and I hope they will find
out. It's the right place to come to for
that," he said, his eyes brightening at
the thought that the skill of the London
Hospital doctors would cure him if any
thing could.
What is the matter with Goss the
London Hospital doctors have not yet
fcund out- It may take several days to
discover even if they suceced in ascer
taining. Meanwhile the staff are reti
cent, for they do not wish It to be
understood that they have a case of
exceptional character in band before
they have thoroughly investigated It.

conflict, until the North gained control
of the river, commercial boating below
the mouth of the Ohio was broken up
entirely. On the Missouri a new source
of business sprang up in the early years
of the war by the discovery of gold at
the headwaters of that stream. Then
began that most remarkable episode la
the history of river navigation, the
sending of cargoes from Sr_ Louis "to
the base of the Rocky Mountains, mor
than two thousand miles distant and
half a mile vertically upward.
Long before the steamboat business
on the Mississippi and its tributaries
had reached its maximum, the forces
which were to accomplish its ruin had
begun to operate. The beginning of
practical railroading followed many
years after that of steamboating; but
when it once got well under way its
progress and development rapidly out
stripped those of its older rival. Here
was a steam engine that could go with
its load anywhere. It did not have to
follow water courses. It could climb
mountains if they were in its way. It
could serve the Inland town as well as
the river port. Its speed was four times
or more that of the steamboat. It was
not put out of commission by the win
ter's ice, but served the public the year
round. Clearly the steamboat stood lit
tle show in its struggle with a rival like
this.
For many years, from one came and
another, the boats held their own; but
finally the railroads got the upper hand,
and their vast development In the
twenty-five years following tha Civil
War practically drove the steamboat
business from the rivers.
The commercial interests of the coun
try have always looked with regret
on the disappearance of the steamboat.
There is a deep-rooted conviction that
our rivers have some value In the com
mercial economy of the country, as
regulators of freight rates If nothing
more: and there has been a strenuous
effort to maintain active navigation.
There is a hopeful belief that the future
will see the rivers again teeming with
boats, as they do in Ru3Sia, Austria
end France. But the logic of statistics
la against it.â H. M. Chittendea. In The

Curiosity.
A well-known family in the Western
Addition is the proud owner of a mag
nificent pointer dog, a several times
prize winner. He is a beautiful ani
mal, with Intelligence almost human,
and in consequence his owners give
him much care and attention. He is
so well behaved that the women in the
family frequently take him with them
on their shopping tours. Last Thurs
day they took him to a large millinery
store on Market street. The next
morning the dog was missing and a
very excited house became that West
ern Additioq home. The neighborhood
was thoroughly searched, but the
pointer could not be found. Later in
the day the dog was brought to the
house by a boy employed at the millin
ery store visited Thursday.
"He's been in the store all day,
ma'am," said the boy.
The next morning the dog was miss
ing again ahd. remembering the expe
rience of the day before, one of the
family went immediately to the millin
ery store. Sure enough, there was the
dog. He was the center of attraction.
He sat on his haunches with his eyes
glued to the little cash boxes used for
carrying the price of goods sold to the
cashier's -desk. The proprietor of the
store told the owner cf the dog that on
the day before as soon as he reached
the store the pointer ran over to the
counter where his mistresses had made
their purchase, gave a yelp when the
first little cash .box started on its rapid
flight to the cashier's desk and chased
after it. He followed the one the cash
ier sent back with the change and
every other box that went over the
line until he was taken to the base
ment and there locked up.
"This morning when he came in,"
said the proprietor, "he contented him
self with squatting himself where you
made your purchase and watching the
rapid flight of the boxes back and
'forth."

the manner in which our building is to be opened and the
way in which it will be conducted thereafter.
Only four buildings have been erected by cities of the
United States: New York, San Francisco, Kansas City
and St. Paul and Minneapolis jointly. Since other cities
are to open formally, it wrjl naturally be expected that
we do likewise, and there is no apparent reason why we
should not do so. A reception of a creditable nature
could be given without great expense, and the matter
should be taken up at once.
The second proposition, that of conducting our building
so as to attract the greatest number of visitors, is one of
much more importance. We are now squarely in the
center of the stage, with critical attention directed
toward us. Our venture has been duly launched and
will be measured in comparison with the surrounding
exhibits. â¢ The San Francisco building, with its tower
rising 100 feet from the ground directly in front of one
of the principal entrances in the Modef City, is visible
from every direction and makes us well situated to at
tract visitors. But location "is not everything. It must
be supplemented by energy and every effort made to
furnish proper entertainment and to make the exhibit
attractive.
We are part of a great fifty-million dollar show, where
fifty-one States and Territories and fifty-one foreign na
tions are taking part, and we cannot afford to make any
thing but a first-class showing. San Francisco's pride
and welfare demand that such be made, and if there be
any lack of money or material she should see to it that
it be forthcoming. It is not probable that in many years
to come â if at all â we shall have such a chance to ad
vertise our city and* illustrate her future, and if we make
a proper, showing now we will reap great, and lasting
benefit therefrom.

When so skillful a playwright as R.

one of the most thriving of London
theaters, and with his wife. Miss
Compton, in the principal role as usual,
one looks forward to an evening cf
undimmed pleasure. In all except
on? particular, "The Rich Mrs. Rep
ton." produced at the Duke of York's
Theater under the Frohman manage
ment on Wednesday evening, came up
to these high expectations. There was
bright, pointed and natural dialogue,
lots of cleverness in situation, really
excellent actingâ almost everything
playgoers could wish, except a story
that was worth telling. The Rich Mrs.
Repton is a middle aged widow vrho fs
a "good fellow." She has Immense
wealth, just a suspicion of a past, a
heart of gold,, and a delight in doing
good by stealth without being fussy or
"preachy." She has half a dozen hard
up men under her comfortable wing
and finds ingenious ways of benefiting
them all. One of them is young Lord
Charley Dorchester who has gone
broke on racing and has staked all he
can raise from money lenders on a
horse race that is not coming off for
two months. He refuses to accept a
loan from "Mrs. Jack"â as the boys all
call the adored Mrs. Repton â but says
if she would consent to be engaged to
him for the intervening two months
the money lenders would cease from
troubling, and thereafter he could ex
plain it easily to the young girl whose
heart he had won. That is so much
like Irresponsible farce than legitimate
comedy that it makes the spectator
feel as if he had been trifled with when
the good natured widow consents. At

Gilbert must have felt considerable
gratification during the last few days
at finding thatâ long as it has been |
eince the curtain fell at the Savoy upon j
the last of the famous operas that he
v-rote with Sir Arthur Sullivanâ he is
by no means a prophet without honor
in his own country. Seldom is fo much
anticipation aroused among London
"t heater-goer.* over a new piece as ex
ins concerning that with which Gilbert
iÂ«= about to break his long silence. And
Â¦when the other night "Pinafore's" au
thor departed from what for several J
years has been his rigid rule and made j
an address in jocular vein to a London j
dramatic society there was general de- |
light to discover that the wit which
sparkled in The Mikado." 'Patience'
and "The 1'irates of Penzance" abides
undiminished in their veteran author.
"A wild play" was the phrase in
which Mr. Gilbert described his latest
dramatic whimsicality to Arthur Bour
(hier, who was the first to hear of it.
The author and actor-manager, who
are friends, were lunching together at
the time. "I have a good idea for a
wild play." announced Gilbert. "Write
it for me. then," .quoth the manager.
Â¦The public certainly will welcome
your return to the stage."
And 60 it is that rehearsals, presided
over by Mr. Gilbert, are now going on
daily at the Garrick behind locked
doors and with the iron curtain down.
!<Â»?t the secret of the "vrild play" should j
leak out. Meanwhile we have the half- â¢
satisfaction cf hearing officially that i
the new workâ w hich if successful will,
cf course, be done at home â is in two
acts and absolutely Gilhertian in theme, j
Part of it is about a society woman
who is engaged to be married to an of
ficer in the army, and who unexpect
edly has some queer experiences as a
hospital nurse. Hot.- keen is public in
terest in the forthcoming piece can be ,
judged from the fact that it was grave
ly reported the other day that Mr. Gil
bert had made two visits to Drury Lane
recently with a view to finding out how
a pantomime clown "makes up," the
deduction being that there is something
about pantomime doings in the myste
rious play. The comedy, which has just

will be produced at the Garrick on

At the dinner of the Gallery First

to speak, blew out my brains.

The London Stage.
As already mentioned, the exports of gold, with the
uncertainty regarding its continued development, with
the slow decline in business throughout the country and
the reports from the iron and steel industry, which are
now unfavorable, have undermined public confidence in the
stock market, and sharcs^vent down pretty much all the
week. Steel common stock declined to $8 50, a sig
nificant quotation when it is remembered that not more
than a year ago it was loudly proclaimed that the vast
interests controlling steel would not permit the stock to
get below $10. The decline does not come in the nature
of a surprise, however, as the public have lately become
prepared to expect almost any bizarre emanation from
the steel trust. The recent free selling of the stock is
generally attributed to the throwing over of large lines
of Schwab holdings, and some operators on the New
York Exchange last week broadly stated that Schwab
himself was selling "out of spite," though this was prob
ably a mere matter of opinion. Anyhow the stock was
ladled out on the market and the whole list of shares
went down day after day.
With the decline in stocks money went up, as already
said, *and good judges predicted a further advance in
rates during the next thirty days. Thus far, however, the
advance is slight, and even at the increased quotations
money is still low.
General distributive trade made an important showing
last week, being promoted by better weather- The Govern
ment crop report, showing a winter wheat condition of
76.5 per cent, was considered bullish, as it indicated a
winter wheat crop of 340,000,000 bushels, compared with
a harvested crop of 401,685,000 bushels last year. The
great staples, such as grains, wool, hides, groceries, dry
goods, footwear, cotton, textile goods, iron and steel,
etc., showed no particular change from the preceding
week. The reports from /the iroa and steel industry, as
already stated, were poor. Quotations for cattle, sheep
and. hogs steadily declined, and present indications are
that the- era of high-priced meats is drawing to a close,
as either the production has" increased to > the limit of
consumption or the latter has fallen ofiV Perhaps both
conditions exist.
The bank clearings also made an improved exhibit last
week, the decrease from the corresponding week in 1904
being only 1.2 per cent, a much smaller decrease than
has prevailed for a long time past. The failures for the
week were 236, against 106 last year, and included none
of serious proportions.
There is nothing new in trade conditions on this coast
except that business is quieter in those lines which take
their cue from the Eastern markets and which naturally
follow the course of those markets in sympathy. Those
of our markets which are local and governed by our own
proper conditions, continue active_and in good, tone, and
even in the "lines which sympathize with the East no
serious complaint is heard. We seem to be doing an ex
cellent business all around and keeping, up a very satis
factory margin of profits. * .
country's wants."
The fact iÂ«, the public and private vaults of the country
are gorged with gold. Our stores of the yellow metal
had become so huge and unwieldy that our financiers
did not know what to do with them. One astute finan
cier, who keeps close tally on the financial situation,
points out, in a recent circular,- that "the amount of
money now in circulation' is $2,532,000,000, an increase in
twelve months of $158,000,000. These figures, however,
give only a partial idea of the tremendous expansion in
our circulation which has lately taken place. During the
last three years our currency increased nearly $330,000,
000, while in the last seven years the increase, has been
$847,000,000, and our per capita circulation has risen from
$23 to $31 in the last seven years. In other words, in
this short period we have added $650,000,000 to our stock
<Â»f gold and about $200,000,000 to our supply of bank
notts." He then pertinently asks: "'What is to be the
efi'tct of such an enormous addition to our currency
at a time when it is not needed? Is it likely to lead to a
period of inflation? It is to be hoped not; and in view
of the conservative temper which prevails in financial
circles no such contingency is in sight, although such an
cxppnsion as this must inevitably exert an important in-
Huence upon values. Such congestion would be impos
sible had we an elastic currency system capable of ex
panding and contracting automatically according to the
extent these current gold exports may be carried, it is
the general opinion that the present month will be a rec
ord one for gold exports. Since the exports began early
in April they already amount to over $40,000,000- They
have been largely offset by importations of Japanese gold
yen at San Francisco, and, as previously mentioned, much
of this gold now flowing out of New York to Europe is
simply the flow of the Japanese gold through San Fran
cisco and New York to Europe to pay for war supplies
purchased by Japan, so the real exports from the United
States are nowhere near as large as these figures would
indicate on their surface. This is probably the reason
why the proportions of the current outflow cause no par
ticular excitement in financial circles.
In addition to these gold exports there are other heavy
drains upon stocks of gold in one form or another.
The Treasury Department has sent notice of 'the with
drawal on May 25 of the final 10 per cent installment of
40 per cent of the Government deposit in banks, and these
withdrawals, when completed, will have taken some $50,
000,000 from the banks- Then there is the application
of at least $'5,000,000 to the floating of the Anglo-Amer
ican loan of $50,000,000 to Japan. Furthermore, there is
the financial operation connected with the floating of the
$30,000,000 bond sale of the city of New York with the
payment of $20,000,000 of telephone notes. To these im
mense sums must be added the huge borrowings of the
railroad companies, which aggregate $300,000,000, dur
ing the past several months. A mere glance over these
figures shows the vast dimensions of the financial move
ment now going on in the money center of the country.
And all this without a flurry, the only effect thus far
perceptible being a slight hardening in money rates, say
'/ 2 of 1 per cent.
COMMERCIAL interest last week centered in Wall
street, where the leading features were the ex
tremely heavy gold exports, the marked decline in
stocks and the changed aspect of the money market.'
â¢The gold exports on Thursday were $11,500,000, the
heaviest single day's shipments ever- known. They were
closely followed on Saturday by $7,000,000 more, and the
two shipments, with previous ones thus far in May, make
a total of more than $25,000,000. The largest amount
ever before exported in a full month from New York
was in May, 1S04, when $27,449,000 went out.
May is only half gone, ai:d as nobody knows to what
"The sight was too much for Dewey.
In three strides he was beside the fire
man. Quivering with rage, he stood
over the bluejacket and, pointing to
the mess upon the deck, said, with all
sorts of scorn and disgust in his voice:

The exquisite neatness of Admiral

Numerous stories have been told about

was walking about the ship, prying
into corners and, as we all well knew,
looking for dirty spots, he suddenly
stopped his promenade and stepped be
hind a covered hatchway. I was in a
position to note his every movement
and saw that he had his eye on a big,
husky fireman who sat in the bright

big piece- of 'navy' tobacco. Four feet
away from him stood a 'spit-box* (a

speculation as to the result. Bad luck
came at first, for neither "A Queen's

Waller followed the Davidson play, did
anything in particular. They were un
attractive pieces at best, however, so
it probablv wasn't the theater's fault.
Now, in "Miss Elizabeth's Prisoner"â
v.hich is a play about the American
Civil War â Waller seems to have found
a real "winner"â and It will be surpris

IN defense of Russia's position in the present war and
of her previous diplomatic policy in the Far East
"which culminated in the armed clash with Japan,
Count Cassini, the Czar's Embassador at Washington,
has contributed an article to the current North American
Review that contains several assertions open to debate.
After reviewing the Russian contentions in Manchuria
and berating Japan for not coming to a peaceable agree
ment concerning the same, Count Cassini proceeds to
demonstrate how American .interests are bound up with
those of Russia by ties far more material than those of
mere sentiment. HeySays:
"What then, taking these matters into consideration, is
the Far Eastern question viewed in its commercial aspect
from the American point. of view? On the. one hand (in
case of a Japanese victory) stands Manchuria open to
the commerce of the world â Japan in competition with
the United States, a manufacturing Japan capable of
inak-ng the goods needed in Manchuria and of making
them cheaper than America can make them and having
the additional advantage of short all-water freight rates.
On the other hand (should Russia win) stands Man
churia under Russian control with a friendly hand ex
tended to the United States and Japan given no en
couragement." To this promise Cassini adds, with
happy peroration, "What better evidence of Russian
friendship could America have than such an opening?"
'.'he meat in the forecast Cassini thus makes would
seem to be this: that if Japan wins there will be a free
Manchuria trade, but America will have to compete
against the superior advantages of the Japanese; if
Russia gains the victory there will be a restricted trade,
Japan naturally being discriminated against, but the
United States being the happy recipient of Russia's
"friendly hand."
Now, from what American trade has 'learned in the
past in the matter of that "friendly hand" of Russia on
the trade door of China, Count Qassini must pardon us
if we indulge in speculation whether it will be the hand
of Esau or the hand of Jacob. This sudden 'bout face
which Cassini prophesies in the nature of Russian trade
policy in the Far East comes as a surprise. even from a
nation who'se actions have ceased, to surprise.
In 1000 Russia pledged herself to the maintenance of
the "open door" in China after every power but the United
States had despaired of ever wringing this concession
from her- Then followed' one treaty after another be
tween that power and China by which China successively
gave up its rights to build railroads, dig mines and tax
Russian goods according to their valuation â all this in a
province nominally under the sway of the Chinese Em
peror. Then when our Government concluded a treaty
with the Emperor for the opening of two of his ports in
Manchuria to American trade Russia declared that China
had no right to break the rigid trade exclusion the Rus
sian "closed door" had so effectually built up.
In the lfght of these facts and of the many other evi
dences of Russia's feverish endeavors to get the trade of
the FaÂ«l East into the. closed Muscovite fist, can Count
Cassini persuade us that Manchuria under a continued
Russian domination offers the only hope of salvation for
American trade in the Orient?

CHICO'S POPULATION*.
School Census Shows Growth in Thriv

The Chlco Enterprise gives an ab

and says:
There are 1761 children In the Chico School
District. Of this number 405 are under the
age of 5 years, which. leaves 1330 children be
tween the ages of 5 and 16 year*. Of the
whole number there are MÂ«Â» girls and 8C2 boys.
A comparison of the report this year with
that of 19C3 shows an excellent growth. Last
year the Independence District was formed
and cut off from the Chico District. The
census of this year shows that there are J10
scholars, in this district. Last year. there was
in Chlco District a total of 1649 children, of
which number 418 were under the age of 5

of 2H in the two districts, there are thirteen
less children under 6 years than there were
last year. Chlco School District has an J in-
HAYWARDS, May 15. â The entire
fruit crop throughout Alameda Coun
ty will be light this year and some
varieties will only average a small per
centage of the usual yield. There will
be scarcely a third of the ordinary
crop of apricots, pears and almonds,
and prunes will be very light. Cher
ries will yield a fair crop, but it is ex
pected that prices will rule high, for
the distillers have already contracted
for large quantities of Royal Ann
cherries at 5*4 cents a pound. The
price offered by the canners isÂ«5 cents.
Â¦ The grain crops will be good, as
there has been a great Improvement
in conditions during the past month.
There will be a heavy crop of hay and
in some sections mowing has already
commenced. It looks at present as if
the prices of hay and grain would be
about the same as last year, but the
price of fruit promises to be high
throughout the entire season.
CROPS WILL. BE LIGHT.
Plums are reported to give fair promise, but
not hardly up to the average of the usual prod
uct of this section. The Bartlett pear will. It
is said, fpr outstrip any of the other fruits In
volume' of yield.
The peach crop, when the different varieties
are considered. Is reported an nearly up to the
average. Though the clings will be rather
.Â«hort. freestones give much promise of making
up the deficiency. The matter of loss from
split pits cannot yet be determined.
There will be a very decided falling eff of
prunes In thjs section. Many of the largest
orchard!*. It is said, will not yield more than
half the usual amount. It Is thought that the
biosuoms were injured* by the late ratns, as in
the case of the cherries. One encouraging fact
should not. however, be lost sight of. When
the fruit is thin upon the trees it usually at
tains a much larger eize and is, therefore,
much more marketable at the highest price,
and can be handled at lees expense.
The prospect for berries, a crop for which
Sonoma County Is justly celebrated, is good.
The bushes are at present In bloom and give
evidence of a very large yield, and^aa far as
the grade is concerned it is a well known fact
that the berries grown in this section are of the
very best quality.
The outlook for cherries, especially the Royal
Annes. is not at present very flattering, as the
late rains are reported to have damaged the
blosscms eo that this variety will not exceed
one-half the usual yield. Of course there are
exceptions to this rule in cases where the trees
ere In a sheltered position. The soft whites
and blacks wiU ccme up to nearly the usual
yield.
The Santa Rosa Republican says con
cerning the outlook for the fruit- crop
of Sonoma County:
The prospects for the numerous varieties Of
fruits grown In Sonoma County is a matter of
vital Importance to its residents; both those
who depend upon the industry for employment
and those who market the same in the various
forma.

SONOMA COUNTY FRUITS.
Santa Rosa. Â¦ the county seat of Sonoma
County, is the largest city but one in
California west of Sacramento and north
of Fan Francisco. It has a population
of about SfJOO, and double that number
of people live within a radius of a few miles.
The city is the natural capital of th* north
went coast and the. railway center for a larK<?
territory. Twenty trains arrive and depart
from Santa Rosa every day. connecting it
with all parts of the county, the Interior of
the State, San Francisco. Sacramento, the
overland trains for the East, Oregon, the
Sound cities and British Columbia.
When the first railroad reached Santa Rosa
in 1S71 it had fewer than one thousand inhab
itants, which , increased in the next few years
to three thousand, since which time It has had
a rapid rrowth. It is now surrounded by
many small, well-cultivated farms. It has
very large outlying hop. fruit and wine Inter
ests which center in the city. Not less than
sixteen thousand bales of hops and targe quan
tities of fresh, dried and canned fruit*, vege
tables, grapes and wine are sold annually In
Â£anta Rosa. There is a rapidly increasing
Industry in growing vegetables for canning,
especially asparagus, tomato's and etrins:
tx-nno. all of which are profitable crops. The
yield of tomatoes per ton is astonishing; they
thrive beyond all precedent In this atmosphere.
The Santa Rosa Progressive Associa
tion has in Santa Rosa a city of rare
attractions to promote. The Santa Rosa
Press-Democrat in a special edition
made the following statements.
Sonoma County has now in operation
woolen mills, boot and shoe factories,
mills for grinding the various cereals,
a large silk factoryâ the only dne of its
kind in the West, a cream of tartar
works, a must factory, lumber mills,
tanneries,. breweries, carriage factories,
wineries, incubator factories, ice and
refrigerating plants, pickle works and
other manufacturing enterprises.
The wineries at the Asti Swiss-Italian
Colony produce nearly one-fifth of the
dry wines of California, and connected
with them is the largest wine tank in
the world. Santa Rosa is renowned all
over the world as the home of Luther
Burbank, the wizard of horticulture.

LARGE MEMBERSHIP.
crease this year of 125 over the two districts
of last year.
The Cliico District takes In Chlco. Veclno.
Chapmuntown and Oakdale and extends for
quite a distance down the river road. The
Independence District was cut off from the
northwestern part of Chlco. and takes In a
greater territory than the mother district.
This Increase of 1-5 In Chlco District is about
1C 2-3 prr cent, and goes far to show what a
growth has been made In the last year. The
school census Is about the only way there. Is

For a long period Sonoma County has
had its County Board of Trade, the i
purpose of which is to foster the wel- 1
Jare of the county, to exploit !
abroad and at home its fertile soil and !
cenial climate, together with its many !
advantages, educational, industrial and i
Â«jocial," to induce desirable immigra- !
tion and to maintain in the County I
Courthouse at Santa Rosa a perraa- J
nent exhibition of county products j
at.d a supply of literature relating to j
tht county.
All these purposes have been kept j
in view since the County Board of j
Trade began its work. In all parts of j
the United States and in many parts j
â¢of Europe, the name and fame of So- j
noma County have been heard. Thou- j
cands have visited the exhibit in the.|
'County Courthouse; thousands have I
been La correspondence with the Coun- j
ty Board of Trade, which is repre- j
sented by Arthur 6. Luce as secretary. !
Recently the idea was entertained {
that Saxta Rosa needed a Progressive |
Association to call attention to its |
merits as an individual community in
Sonoma County. That was a popular
proposition from the outset. There |
Â¦was no perceptible reason why calling j
attention to Santa Rot-a, individually, j
would not be producive of good results, i
Many other California cities have j
r-lected not to hide their lights under a
bushel. What others have successful-*
â¢ ly accomplished Santa Rosa can do.
This sort of reasoning made it com
.fiaratively easy to give the new Pro
gressive Association a start and quite
a large initial membership of a repre
sentative sort.
The Association has held only one
meeting up to date, but It already has
an cxecut:e committee which includes
capitalists, bankers, merchants and
otbVra of enterprise and ability.
BOMB NOVEL METHODS.
The methods of the new Progressive
Association are novel in some respects.
One difficulty that is encountered in
an organization to help thfe' progress
of a town or city is the tendency of
members to drop out of active partici
pation in the work after The first few
meetings. In some places, in fact, It
. Is as hard to get a quorum of members
together for the public good, on or
dinary occeeiens, as it is to map out
definite lines of action that shall prove
; to be good when put to the test of
â¢ actual trial.
ThÂ«Â» Santa Rosa Progressive Associa
tion has embodied in its plan of organ
ization an idea that haÂ« been implicitly
believed in by women ever since the
dawn of the cookery of civilization â
the way to a man's heart is through
his stomach.
"The dues of this association," so
reads the circular that bears the sig
natures of the original members of the
Progressive Association, "are to be one
dollar, to be used for banqueting pur
poses only. Each member is entitled
to a seat at each banquet. Immedi
ately after the banquet an assessment
of one dollar will be levied upon each
member to be used to defray the ex
jx-nFes of a banquet that is to follow."
The sagacious inventor of the Pro-
BJXMlve Association has found a way
â¢ to get a quorum and to insure a series
.of pleasant occasions at which the 1
measures that are devised for the good
of Santa Rosa may be discussed while
the members feel comfortable and are
in pleasing touch at the banquet board.

THE FUTURE REVEALED, THE PAST
DISCLOSED.
Th* Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flam mar ion" a treatise that is
so electrifying the world to-day. He is no
imitator. His work is upon original lines,
' pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to kn\w and works in the open
light. } *
He is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis aa he is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
1b of little value; when tha mind ia troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.
.This Is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you when you call on him for a flrst-
class clairvoyant reading.
He asks you' no questions,- but tell* you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.
Permanently located 42S Eddy at.; 3 aep-

called.
The Oakland home contingent got
only seven innings tor their admission
price yesterday morning and most of
the excitement was condensed into the
two opening periods. In, the second,
with two men out, Baum was relieved
from slab duty and Hall was substi
tuted. Hall hit the first batter and a
wild throw by Eager brought in two
runs and practically settled the game.

The faithful who were rooting for
the southerners/ experienced some un
pleasant heart action yesterday after
ternoon at Recreation Park in Oak
land's fifth turn at wielding the stick.
"With but one hand turned down, the
corners quickly became â¢ filled with a
trio of Lohman's sprinters and It was
passed up to Kruger to bring his
brethern home.
It seemed almost a certainty the Aia
medans would at least make an even
thing of the score, but there are con
tinual reminders that the word "cer
tain" has long been classed as obso
lete in the lexicon of the national pas
time.
Kruger made the effort, and a des
perate effort It was. but his swift
drive into short territory was mftt by
such a rapid counter move in the
ehape of a double plav that Oakland's
hope of victory was squelched between
breaths.
The first fhird of the game was
marred by the unfortunate pitching of
"Whittredge, who was clearly not in
a mood for working effectively. The
record against him for his brief ap
pearance is five hits, two wild pitches,
a couple of passes and an injured
batsman. Then Buchannan was sum
moned from the bench and from the
fourth to the close the play was of
the snappy brand, transforming into
an enjoyable exhibition what had
promised to be a tedious performance-.
Despite the fact that he had been
deemed unworthy to continue through
out the morning game, Charlie Baum
was designed to the propelling post
of thÂ«Â» Los Angeles battery. Having
a double incentive to make good, the
youngster extended himself, and bar
ring a little weakness in the third, his
work would have been creditable to a
M&floned veteran.
The enlivening flashes of the after
noon were a splendid stop by Flood
in the second, the killing double play
from Raymond to Flood to Chase, and
the base running of Cravath.
In the first for the champions Ber
nard hit safely, stole second, went to
third on a wild pitch anfl scored on a
passed ball, j In the third Bernard
rapped a safe one over short, advanced
on a steal and came in on a double
shot by Ross. Cravath was hit by a
pitched ball and Chase's single brought
in both rurners. In the ninth Flood's
single. Cravath's force hit and -Chase's
double added a brace of runs to the
southern score.
In only one inning did Oakland give
work to the Scoreboard boy. In the
third Boettiger and Ganley waited suc
cessfully and finished the circuit when
Francks hit safely to right and Cra
vath failed to stop the ball. The error
sent Francks to third. He crossed the
plate on Kruger's out, â Raymond to
Chase. The score:

Sacramento greyhounds swept the
card yesterday at Union Coursing Park.
Barge beat Rubber Ankles, the Ameri
can Waterloo winner, in the seml-flnul
round of the Grand National champion
stakes, while Belle Free and Qulta
reached the deciding course of the open
stake. In the run-off Belle Free won.
Quita was so unfortunate as to get a
long trial in the semi-final round, which
dulled her speed when the supreme test
came. Belle Free led the Nethercott
representative eight lengths to the hare
and won by a score of 7 to 4.
The Grand National trials proved too
short to provide true tests of Bargo
and Rubber Ankles. The latter is es
sentially a stayer and won the longest
of the series. This lasted only thirty
five seconds, the shortest being thir
teen seconds. Barge led in each of the
four trials, the first time by four
lengths, then by two and in the others
bj- one length each.

! One of the most important shooting
festivals of the year was held yester
day at Shell Mound Park. The occas
ion was the fortv-flfth annual spring
shoot of the San Francisco Schuetzen
Verein. This society is the oldest or
ganized rifle association in the State
and has done much to foster target
I shooting in this community. As It
embraces among its membership many
of the best experts at the rifle range,
good scores are always expected.
Adolph Strecker fired 96 shots at the
point target and did not at any time
miss the 12-inch black at a distance
of 200 yards.
Frank E. Mason was away above
the other competitors in the 30-shot
class, scoring 63 and 68 points on each
ticket. On his 63 point ticket he wound
up with four dead centers and broke
the Pacific Coast record for a 30-shot
score. .On h!s best ticket he made 25
six-inch bullseyes, which is remarkable^
shooting.
August Pape in his first 100 shots
made five points more than an average
of two points per shot. As one and a
half points is considered good shooting.
Pape's performance was high class and
will stand for a long time to com*.
He fired 126 shots without missing the
black, a record hard to equal.
Among the visiting marksmen were
Jacob Myer. Captain Frank Ruhstaller
and Jacob Gruhler of Sacramento, who
all made good scores and carried oft
prizes as a memento of the occasion.
. Among the prominent shooterg who
appeared at the targets were:
Adolph Strecker. present shooting king of
thÂ»- United States; Frank E. tlamn, shooting
king of the California Schuetzen Club: F. At

The semi-final round of the stake at
Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday had
a material bearing: on the deciding
course. Doc Burns, which had been
running well all day, met Firm Fellow
and ran for two minutes and thirty-one
seconds. Miss Bummel then came out
with Royal Friend and ran one minute
and thirty-one seconds.
The half-hour's rest was not suffi
cient for Doc Burns and he was beaten
by Miss Brummel by a score of 15 to 4
for the long end of the purse.
Five hounds were withdrawn in the
second round owing to severe running
on Saturday. A plucky- hare caused
the downfall of Ragged Actor, a 1 to 5
choice over Evil Eye. The latter led
and then had the favor of the hare
throughout. The day's results with

The followers of tennis experienced
many surprises yesterday. At Golden
' Gate Park J. D. MacGavin. who car
ried off the honors in the last two class
tournaments, was beaten by Will Al
| len, who in turn succumbed to George
I Baker in the finals. The surprise was
I that Allen, though playing a poor
| game at present, beat a man like Mac
! Gavin. Allen's defeat at the hands
, of Baker was expected, but his failure
to make even a showing is hard to
[ understand.
! Another unexijected happening oc
j curred in the second class when Her
! bert Long was beaten by E. P. Finne
; gan. Long has been defeating some
| good players in practice and it is a
â¢ mystery how he could have lost to
j Finnegan. In the last two eets the
I loser won only one game.
Surprise number three occurred at
the California Tennis Club in the
j finals of the handicap doubles tourna
ment. Roy Cornell and C. J. Smith,
j after taking the first two sets and hav
j ing every appearance of being winners
were nosed out in the last three sets
by Schmidt and Itolfe.
As was expected, this match was
a long drawn out affair and proved
I rather poor tenni*. The players, all but
j Schmidt, played a safe, lobbing game.
i Smith and Cornell excelled in this in
the first two sets, but toward the end
their two lobs were shor,t and their
opponents had an easy time killing
them.
The victory of and Rolfe is
their second one. They need but one
more to gain permanent possession of
, the cups. The score was 6-8, 1-6. 6-4,
j 6-4. C-0.
At the public courts in Golden Gate
Park George Baker and A. H. Bra
bant carried off the honors. The for
mer won the first class and the latter
I the second.
Baker was at his best and at no
time was he in danger of losing a
! match. In the final match with Allen.
j he played an excellent game. Allen's
j errors were extremely numerous, hut
j Baker also scored' on aces. Allen
! seems to have forgotten how to play
I the game, as he was unable to execute
! a stroke in his match with Baker.
I How MacGavin could have lost to hirn
under these conditions is hard to con
ceive.
By winning yesterday. Baker gets
his name on the cup for the second
[ time, tied with MacGavin. The latter
wflj probably not be able to parti
cipate in the next tournament, in
which casf Baker should have an easy,
time winning the trophy.
In the second class Long," Foley and
Janes were thought to have the best
chance to win. but Brabant proved
loo strong for them, beating Foley
in the eemi-finals and Janes in the
finals.
The following tournament matches
were played yesterday at the Califor
| nia Club and Golden Gate Park
courts.

which was taken a purse containing
25 cents, and the residence of Mrs.
Watson at 2928 Pierce street, from
which was stolen a quantity of

minutive for their age, readily con
fessed to having committed the burg

having robbed several other houses.
The lads were turned over to the

Abraham, said the speaker, was ex
ceedingly wealthy, and his flock was
large in number. Still Christian and
Mohammedan look back on that rich
man as the friend of God. The Scrip
tures, He pointed out, do not condemn
wealth, but the use to which some
times it is put.
Reverting to his subject, he said
they must train the new Methodist to
learn to give, and he said further that
a moral purpose with an intellectual
clearness must go hand in hand in
the modern path.
There was no such thing mms the
mention of dividing property in the
Scriptures, said Dr. *Larkin, though
there are people of socialistic ten
dency who give that doctrine as scrip
tural.

of the nickname "Methodist" being
given the denomination in England
"because of theij^ method of doing

considered, must develop good meth

new method must be money making

automobile driven by Ben Holliday
turned over three times, pinioning he
oeath it Mrs. Holliday and her sister.
Miss Andrews. Mrs. I-.oIliday suffered
eevere and perhaps faf.al injuries, both
hips being dislocated. Her sister's col
larbone was broken. The accident, the
first serious one of the kind near Port
land, occurred near Trout/iale, twelve
xr.iles from here, this evening.
The auto was uninjured and by some
chance stopped right side up. Holliday
found that the machinery was sound
and managed to drive the automobile
Uj> the barTk and used it to carry his in
jured wife and sistcr-ln-'.aw into Trout
Â«lale. A physician was immediately
dispatched from Portland in another
o-uto. Mrs. Holliday could not be
moved to-night. Her father, George H.
Andrews, is the woll-known Southern
Pacific land agent. Ben Holliday is the
gon of the pioneer capitalist of the same
name. He is the local agent for an
automobile company. So far as can
now be learned HoHiday lost control of
the automobile while it was running

yesterday afternoon. They were the
last number on the programme, but
held the audience until the curtain
dropped. M. Jean Marcel reproduces
ten of the world's masterpieces in
painting and statuary, assisted by a
company of professional French mod

art. Without so much as a quiver of a
muscle they pose in varied and difficult
situations and lend a color of realism
that has made the act a rage in Europe

podrome was made especially realistic
by the introduction of the two African
lions, Nero and Juno, which were bor
rowed from the Chutes. They growled
and yelped and at intervals raised a
great commotion which barely aug
mented the effectiveness of the scene.
The play will run for the week. Next
week "Fedora," with MacDowell as
Louis Ipanoff.
Her personal charms were greatly
enhanced by a number of handsome
costumes.
Robert Elliott is deserving: of com
mendation for his impersonation of the
cowardly Justinian. Lawrence Grif
fiths was well cast as Marcellus. The
others filled in acceptably:
Melbourne MacDowell began the
third week of his engagement at the
Grand Opera House yesterday in an
elaborate production of Sardou's spec
tacular play "The Empress Theodora."
The main work of the tragedy devolves
entirely upon three characters, and
these three were most adequately por
trayed last night. MacDowell's imper
sonation of Andreas is one of the most
powerful of the impersonations of his
repertoire and in it he shines at his
very best. He has plenty of oppor
tunity to show his vigorous figure and
the outlines of his classical face to the
best advantage. He was very tender
In the early love scenes with Theodora,
and in the garden â¢ scene, where ne
parts from her, the passionate kisses
he showered upon her lips were of the
most realistic order. In fact, they so
approached reality that. the enthusias
tic audience demanded a double encore.
Ethel Fuller as Theodora showed un
usual strength and gave a worthy por
trayal of that difficult character. She
was handicapped by a cold, but even
with these odds against her she was
eminently satisfactory.

contests the day passed off with un
usual eclat. John S. Parry was given
c/redit for much of the good manage
ment that got a big crowd.

curred was when Mrs. Kearney, a vet
eran picnic-goer of 70 summers, who
had already run In the married ladies'
race and' won a prize, insisted in start
ing in the old maids' race with the cre
dential that "she was a widder a long,
long time." She took part in the race
and won the third prize.
The committees worked with a will
and there was not a single fault to be
found with the day's programme. The
gate prizes given away numbered
something like 200. The winners of
the races were:
First . race, boys under 16â Aaron Taussir
won, L. McCaron second, M. Murphy third.

Following were the committees:
Joseph Egan, a union stableman, .was
arrested yesterday afternoon by Po
liceman M. J. O'Sullivan and charged
with drunk and assault with a deadly
weapon. Egan, alias "Kid" Egan, has
been arrested on. a sfmilar charge
twice. He was identified yesterday by
J. W. Fuller, a non-union stableman,
residing at 328 Third street, as the man
who fractured his skull.
Fuller, who is. employed in the sta
bles of Kelly Brothers, on Pine street,
was driving a load of manure from the
stables to a vacant lot on Lombard
street yesterday morning. He was set
upon by four men. who seized him
from behind and dragged him from
his wagon. He was thrown to the
ground, beaten, kicked and jumped
upon by .his four assailants. 'One
grabbed a pitchfork and struck Fuller 1
on ,the head, inflicting several scalp
wounds and fracturing, his skull. His
assailants left him bleeding and made
their escape. He was .taken to the
Emergency Hospital, where the physi
cians have fears for his recovery. One
of his fingers was dislocated in the
struggle. .
Egan was arrested on Polk street
and taken before the injured man at
the hoBoltal and Identified as the one
who struck him with the pitchfork.
He was then taken to the city prison
and locked up. \ '.'
Last Tuesday Egan was arrestod
with two other union men named Rob
ert Hayes and Thomas White Â¦ and
charged with assaulting a non-union
man named A. Takain, on Washington
street, and making threats against his
life. Esan had a large plwe of iron
gas pipe when arrested and one of the
other two men had brass knuckles. The
case against Egan was dismissed in
the Police Court on the ground that he
threw away the gas plpu before the al
leged assault took place. !
The men working in the stables
about the city during the strike now
on between the union stablemen and
their employers have been subjected
to dastardly treatment at the hands
of unknown men on various occasions.
Early yesterday morning Jack Lin
hardt, a milk wagon driver, was drag
ged from his wagon and beaten by four
men. He eluded his assailants and
succeeded in getting away without be
ing seriously injured.
