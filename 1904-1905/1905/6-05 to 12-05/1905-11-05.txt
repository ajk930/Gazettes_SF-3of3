THE BEST OF THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES
THE MYSTERY OF THE BROKER'S CLERK
This U the tenth of a series
*t stories by A. Connn Doyle.
Â£rÂ«ilnc Trtth the adventures of
the fumoun detective, Sherlock
Holtnes, up to the time of his
memorable strasrcle for life
upon the Switzerland moun
tain path with <Ue~roloub table
Mortarirjr. These" are the orig
inal Sherlock Holmes stories,
and the ones which made' Dr.
Doyle*s fame. They are entire
ty apart from the ncries which
recently appeared fa the Son
far Call entitled The Return
â¢f Sherlock Holmes.*
'opyright by A. Conan Doyle and Har
per & Brothers.
*">r HORTLY after my marriage I
had bought a connection in the
M Paddington district. Old Mr.
Farquhar, from whom I pur
k chased It. had at one time an
xcellent general practice, but his age.
nd an affliction of the nature of St.
'ltus' dance from \u25a0which he suffered,
ad very much thinned it. The pub
c not unnaturally goes on the prin
iple that he who would ,hjeal others
lust, himself be whole, and looks ask
nce at the curative powers of the
lan whose own case is beyond the
each of his drugs. Thus as my prcde
essor weakened bis practice declined.
\u25a0
until when I purchased it from him it
had sunk from 1200 to little more than
300 a year. I had confidence, however,
in my own youth and energy, and was
convinced that In" a very few years the
concern would be as flourishing _as'
jtver.
For three months after taking over
â¢the practice I was kept very closely r.t
Vvork and saw little of my friend Sher
lock Holmes, for I was too busy to,
\iÂ»it Baker street, and he seldom went
anywhere himself save upon profes
sional business. I was surprised there
fore when, one. morning in June, as J
sit reading the "British/ Medical Jour
nal" after breakfast," I heard a ring
at the bell, followed by the high,
somewhat strident tones of my old
companion's voice.
"Ah, my dear Watson." said he strid
ing into the room, "am very delighted
to Bee you! I trust that Mrs. Watson
has entirely recovered from all the lit
tle excitement connected, with our ad
venture of the Sign of the Four."
"Thank you. we are both well," said
1, shaking him warmly by the hand.
"And I hope, aleo." he continued, sit
ting down in the rocking' chair, "that
the cares of, medical practice have not
entirely obliterated the interest > which
you used to take in our' littles deduc
tive problems." **'';.
"On the 'contrary," I 'answered, "It
was only last night that I- was look- :
ing over my. old notes and .classifying
some of. our past results.".'
"I trust you don't -.consider your, col
lection closed." - r . ( -; -
"Not ht all./ r should 'iwiih- nothing;
better tjiin'.to !iave some' more*, of 'such,
experiences." .
**To<-cay t; for vxaruplf?** ' â \u25a0'
"Tes;; to-day, if you like." .
' "And as far off ns Birmingham?" -
"Certainly, . if you wfsh.it.'! *>'
"And the practice?"- ;>
"I do aay neighbors when he- soea.

"Ha! nothing could be better," said
Holmes, loaning back in his chair and
looking keenly at me from under his
half -closed lids. "I jierceive that you
have been unwell lately. Summer colds
are always a little trying."
"i was confined to the house by a
severe chill for three days last week.
I thought,- however, that I had cast off
every trace of it."
"So you have. You look remarkably
robust."
"How. then, did you know of it?"
"ily dear felJow, you know. my. meth
ods." . . :
"You deduced it. then?"
"Certainly."
"And from "what?"
"From your slippers." '
"I glanced down at the new' patent
leathers which I was wearing. "How

swered my aucstion \ before; it wad

"Your slippers are: new." he Bald.

"There is one J other detail," said he.
"What do you intend to do about Maw
son's?" .
I had forgotten . all about Mawson's
in my Joy. "I'll write and \ resign,"
said i. \u25a0 .. f. '~\:
"Precisely what I don't want you to
do. I had a row over you with â¢ Mawâ
son's manager, i' had. gone up to ask
him about you and he was very, offen
sive; accused me' of coaxing' you away
from the service; of the firm and that
sort of thing. At last Ifalrly lost my
temper. "'lf you want good men you
should pay them a good' price/ said I.
"'He would rather have our small
price than your big one/.- said he. \u25a0 .... .
"TH lay you a fiver." said I, .'that
when he has my offer you'll ! never so
much as hear from h'.m again/ |
"'Done!' said he. '. 'We picked him
out of the gutter, and he" won't" leave
us so easily/ Those r were , his very
words." . r .
"The Impudent scoundrel!" I crle.L
'Tve never so much as seen him. ln 'my
life. Why should "I consider him in
any way? I shall certainly not write
if you would rather I didn't."
"Good! That's a promise," said he,
rising from his chair. "Well. I'm de
lighted to have got so good a man for
my brother. Here's your advance of
Â£100, . and here Is ..ie letter. Make a
note of the address. 126b Corporation
street, and remember that 1 o'clock to
morrow is your appointment Good
night, and may you have all the for
tune that you deserve!"
That's just about all that passed be
tween 5 us. as near as I can remember.
You can Imagine, Dr. Watson, how
pleased I was at such an extraordi
nary bit of good fortune. I sat up half
the night hugging myself over it, and
next day I was off to Birmingham in a
train that would take me in plenty
time for my appointment I took r.iy
things to a hotel in New street and
then I made my way to the address
which had been given me.
It was a quarter of an hour before
my time, but I thought that would
make no difference. 126b was a pass
age between two large shops, which
led to a winding stone stair, from
which there were many flats, let as
offices to companies or professional
men. The names of the occupants
were painted at the bottom on the
wall, but there was no such name as
the Franco-Midland Hardware Com
pany, Limited. I stood for a few min
utes with my heart in my boots, won
dering whether the whole thing, was
an elaborate hoax or not. . when up
came a man and addressed ' nig. He -
was very like the chap I had seen the
night before, the same figure and voice,
but he was clean shaven and -his hair
was lighter. . '/
"Are you Hall Pycroft?" he asked. .-.'â¢-â¢
"Yes," said I. \u25a0: ,;
"Oh! I was expecting you, but you are
a trifle before your time. I had a note;

PEOPLE who -don't know smile at
the gravity with which girls
take hold of what may be called
the machinery of school life.
People who know feel about tho
apparent trivialities just as you- do,
Dorothy. The class "flower has a mes
sage for every girl in the class and a
meaning, and many a time it helps a
girl to be true and generous, loyal and
faithful. ,
It does more than this, for if she
carry it through nfe as her special
flower It will often give her a lift
over a hard place, and often aid her
to be gracious . and sweet "and full 01
unobtrusive tact as a flower in the
right spot always is.
I know a mother who chose a flower
for every child v/ljo came to her and
so gave to one the thought of the
lily, brave and chaste and pure; to
another that of the. rose, lavish and
rich and beautiful; to another, that
of the violet, modest and unselfish and
serviceable, and to another tlia t of the
palm, strenuous and, versatile and
3turdy. The lily had been her class
flower in her girlish days, and her
children while in her home were to
her whaU her class had been in- close
ness and fellowship of love.
You must choose a flower, Dorothy,
on which everybody can agree. Also,
in a similar way, select an emblem.
This ;nay be a jewel tint, as ruby,
jasper, emerald or diamond. You need
not have the stone, but you may have
the -splnedld color and think what it
signifies. .
Once you have, as a class, selected
paper, basket,, made up .the whole
r'ture. .: "\u25a0'-,\u25a0 .-.:'i'-- "\u25a0'.,â¢" :t ; " _â¢\u25a0

I went back to the hotel with, the big
book under rrtv arm, and with very con- .
dieting feelings in my breast. On. the one â¢
hand I was definitely â¢ engaged and had ;
Â£100 in my pocket; on the other, the look
of the offices, the absence of name on the
wall, and other of the points which would
strike a business man had left a bad im
pression as to the position of my employ
ers. However, come what might, I had
my money, so I settled down to my task.
All Sunday I was kept hard ai work, and
yet by Monday 'l had : only got as far as
H. I went around to my employer, found
him in the same dismantled kind of room,
a^d was told to keep at it until Wednes
day, and then come again. On Wednes
day it was still unfinished, so I hammered
away, until Fridayâ that is, yesterday. ;
Then I brought it round to. Mr. Harry
Pinner- .
"Thank you very much," said he; "I
fear, that I underrated the difficulty of
the task. This/ list will be of very ma
terial assistance to me." '&p
"It took some time," Bald I.
"And now," said he. "I want you -to
make a list of the furniture shops, for
they all sell crockery."
"Very good." ,
"And you can come up to-morrow even
ing, at seven, and let me know how you
are getting on. Don't overwork yourself. ;
A couple of hours at /Day's Music Hall in
the evening would do you no^harm after
your labors." He laughed as he spoke,
and I saw with a thrill that .his second
tooth upon the left: hand side had been '
very badly stuffed with gold.
Sherlock Holmes, rubbed his hands with
delight, and I stared with -astonishment
at our client. '; / \u25a0 - :
"You may! well look surprised, Dr. Watp
son; : but it is this way," said he â¢;\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 "When |

I. found myself In, the . street/, hardly/
knowing â¢ whether I was. on my head or f
my heels, f Back I went tomy hotel,, put â¢
my head }n' a basin of cold water, and
tried to think It out -Why had he sent
me (from London to Birmingham? Why
had he got there before me? And/why
had he written a letter from: himself to
himself? It was altogether too much for
me, and I could .' make/ not sense of ; it."
And then . suddenly /it \u25a0 I struck .me that
what was dark to me might be very light,
your class color, and your class flower
and your class motto you, are, so to.
speak socially on a working basis.
When you have a meeting or a func
tion, you will decorate with the scheme
that is inclusive of your flower and .
your color. , ,
\u25a0 Very subtly, in a way hard to de- \u25a0
scribe and impossible to explain . and
define, your bit of ..ribbon, your little
inexpensive brooch or pin, your -lovely
daisy, pink, daffodil ; or pansy, will in-/
spire you to* what* we call' esprit de,
corps, will give you a sense of com-;
radeship and will make you careful of '
class honor. â¢ ' .'
A high ideal of honor, is one of the
most excellent and most Indispensable
things in your outfit,' both in your own
character and In your class life. . Some
girls have low Ideas of honor, and con 7 "
stantly violate its ethical code. It is
possible for a girl to-: be candid and ..
frank, to plume herself on telling the
exact and literal truth, # to be so accu- ,
rate about' little details that she fright
ens her friends into silence .when'they
try to tell stories in her presence, and '
yet -it is equally, possible f or ' the . same
girl to do dishonorable acts and speak
dishonorable words. . . ,-. .
May I illustrate? If ever you go. !
away on a visit and are admitted as'
a guest: into the home, for instance, of
a schoolmate, a high idea of .honor.":
would prevent you from even : hinting r
at any little . root of bitterness, :.; or
cause .of discussion in that friend's
home. All that passed. under that roof \u25a0
would have for you a certain- sacred-/,
ness. Equally , in' your class life, you*"'
will, if your, ideal of , honor Is high, |
feel disposed always to' defend the .
absent, always to : take the part, of the .
weaker and always/ to smooth : difflcul- /
ties out of the path/of the girl less for
tunate than : yoursel ves. A jchalnV is ; as /
strong as its weakest /link. If, your /
class chain has V anywhere a loosened
link, farewell- to the class spirit in per

:"Tha,t Is suggestive," remarked. Holmes. '.
; "By Jove, I told .you; so!" cried ; the .
clerk. "That's, he walking ahead of us
there."
He pointed to a smallish, dark, well
dressed man who was bustling along the
other side of the road. As we watched
him he looked across at a boy who was
bawling out, the latest edition of the even
ing paper, and running over among the
cabs and buses, he bought one from s
him. Then, clutching it in his hand, he
vanished through a doorway. .
"There he goes l ." cried Hall Pycroft.
"These are the company's offices into
which he has gone. Come with me, and
I'll fix it up as easily as possible." ...
Following his lead, we ascended; five
stories, until we found ourselves out--;
side a half-opened door, at which; our*
client tapped. . A voice within bade us
enter, and we entered a' bare/iunfur
nished room such as Hall Pycroft had
described. At the single table sat -the
man whom we had seen In the street, â¢
with his .evening paper .spread out in
front of him, and as he looked up at
us it seemed to me that I had/never',
looked upon a face which bore 1 such
marks of grief, and of something be
yond grief â -of^ a horror such as comes
to few men in a lifetime. His brow
glistened with" perspiration, his cheeks,
were of the dull, dead white of a/flsh's
belly/and his eyes were wild and star
ing. He looked at his clerk as though
he failed to recognize him, and I could/

What did you ask me, Dorothy? Oh,
to give you 1 some specimens of a good
class motto.
. Well, I fancy a few clever. girls can
conjure up mottos of their , : own, ;* but
I will make . a suggestion: A motto
must, be covering a,- sentiment
worth remembering, a sort of infinite
riches in .a â¢ little room affair. ' . ',
It may be in Latin or. French, if the
class prefer, but â¢on the whole. Eng
lish is a good enough medium for most
purposes. -But If the French be as fa-;
miliar as "English, or the .'Latin, \\ a
phrase that hardly needs translation,'
there is no valid. objection to theifor-;
eign . tongue. "Semper fldelis," or
"Noblesse oblige".' may be understood
by. every girl/ who has gone through
the grammar/ school. , ;
"Each for all" or" "all for each" *is
a good class motto.
."The greatest of these is charity,'.'
comes from . the Bible, which is, a
treasury of: short and noble sentences.
.."In honor, preferring one another,"
is a -good motto.
"Bear and J forbear," is a good and
pithy. legend. â¢
"I; serve." is a sentiment that^ a
schoolgirl may adopt, and ; . a
class carry forward, through its whole
career, for In ; this . world Iwe | have to
serve!one another, and only as "we fbr- :
get self and live in the .habit of j daily
kindness -will J our 'lives . reach the

"A desperate attempt at robbery, cul
minating in the death of one man ' and
the capture of the criminal, occurred
this afternoon in the city. For some time
back Mawson & Willams. the famous
financial house, have been the guardians
of securities which amount in the aggre
gate to a sum of considerably over a
million sterling. So conscious was the
manager of the responsibility which de
veloped, upon -him to. consequeace <of the
great interests at stake that safes the
very latest construction have been em
ployed, and an armed watchman*has been
left day and night in ' the building. It
appears that last week a new clerk named
Hall Pycroft was engaged -by ,- the, firm.
This person appears to. have been none
other than Beddlng'toni the famous for
ger and cracksman, who;' with his broth
er, has only recently emerged from a flva
-years' spell of penal servitude. By some
means, which are not yet clear, he suc
ceeded to winning, under a false name,
this official position in the ofÃce, which
be utilized to obtain moldings of various
locks, and a thorough knowledge of the
position of the strong-box and the. safes.

clerks to leave at midday oh Saturday.

that a -daring and gigantic robbery, had
been committed. Nearly a hundred

fortunate watchman was found doubled

not been for the prompt action of Ser

shattered by a blow from a poker, de

most inopportune hours, when he knows

. not at all up to the standard, and are
â¢ usually not at all what I meant to buy;
but he is so engaging and persuasive, and
/he has such friendly brown eyes and per
'â¢ feet faith in my reliabilityâ and vulner
ability â when other patrons fail, that on
many days, I cat the simple lettuce and
\u25a0 the loathly turnip when my plans call
for alligator pears and crinkly little
greeri peas. Sometimes 1 do it with the
blind hope that it may lead to another
suspender, . or a shirt with at least two
buttons on it; sometimes because the
brown eyes are so very big for the rtirty

that 'if I don't eat turnips once in a while

I know them only â as perhaps you
do, unless you have a boy or a girl in
one of them, or have wrenched your
own education from them by sheer
force of will, and so have come to know
the heart of them â I know them only
from the outside.
Yet in the many times I have passed
them and looked up at the bare, star
ing, yellow-lighted windows of the
Washington School, where the car
swings around the curve; of the Lincoln
School on Fifth street, just \v Undrawn

the toot of the whizzing: auto alter
nates with the .hum of class recitation;
of the half-dozen others illuminating:
the night in the" most uncxpecVvd
places â I have never looked without
the same sensation, the mingling: of ad
miration and pity.
. It is so fine a thing- to care so much
and so genuinely for education, for that
betterment of self that makes after all
for the betterment of the world.
And it is such a hard way to g-et it â '
for these boys and girls who work all
day in factory, shop and office, and who
at night must crush out the natural
youthful dexire for play and bend them
selves to study.
In the nine public night schools of San
Francisco there are over tOOO of such hard
working boys and girlsâ and ? men
and 'womenâseeking education after the
day's toil Is done. >
I suspect that there may be something
in my little vegetable boy's suggestion

The story of 'the night schools is not a
story of the merits of th-s school . and
that, but rather the heact stories of 'boys
and Kirls, men' and women, struggling
against adverse conditions to make some
thing of themselves. \u25a0
Here in one school is a little boy, under
sized and undernourished, a little Jewish
boy with the deep melting eyes of his
race and a haunting note of sadness in his
voice. He is "doi-ns for himself." Hi 3
father is /'away somewheres." His mother
is dead. He has an older brother of 16,
also "doing for hirnlrlfr" This little chap
of 14, and who looks 11, is working for .s4

kindly woman, and poor herself, gives
him a home and his. washing and mend

ov/n children, and he Hves her the^i a

blocks to his work/works from 8 until
5:30, walks the, twenty blocks back to his

v/alks another ten blocks to night school
and back again--Â«just because, as he tells

Many are the motives that bring pu
pils to the night schools, as iwell as
that one of the ambitious boy to make
something of himself. *_
â¢The oldest pupil ever enrolled was a
man of 75, bent, white-haired, white
bearded â a little old quavering Italian.
He came to learn English and in six
months, so^strong was his determina
tion, he went through the first three
books. He came to learn English for
just one reason. He had his own liv
ing to make, and he hoped to make it
selling papers-â he wanted enough Eng
lish to call" 'his papers on tne street
corner. '
â¢ One aged woman eameywith the
most careful regularity every school
night for two ' years, and labored at
her lessons- . with curious diligence,
'even -for an adult pupil â and the adults
are strangely. grim in their determina
tion to, get education. One night she
came- to the principal to say good-by
and he said:
."I am sorry you are going; I've got
so -used to seeing you every night. I
shall miss you. Why are you leav
ing us?"
-"Well, you see," she said with an em
barrassed little laugh, "I've got what
I came for. "All my life I never-knew
hovr. to write, but I never missed it
much -until my family broke up. I
have two granddaughter's I am very
fond, of* ; and they _wertt away from
here.~ They.^wrote .to me. of course,
but I .couldn't read thek- letters to me
nor write my own to them. I never
knew whether those who read their
letters -to me read-rwhat , was really in
thenj.iand I never could be sure that
the letters", that were written- to them
for me said : v.'hat I wanted to say, so
I made up;my rriind to learn .to write
to ; them myself, and I did it. I .can
write as well as my grunddaughters
now."
;.'; Devoted old grandmamma! And it
took Jier two.-y ears to learn.
' Do you remember -Robert' Louis Ste
venson's nun who learned- to read be
cause he heard .'a fragment of "Robin
son Crusoe" and thirsted for the rest?
His counterpart was a pupil in the;,
night schools.
<r One'. night; in one of the down-fown '\u25a0
pchobls. a saiior-looking man came in and
asked. f or ; the principal..
"What"; can- I do for y ou ?"/ asked ; the *\u25a0"
principal. ;
x want zct know if a man as big and
-ti oiu as I am can learn any thing?"
"I think so. I think we could teach
you something here."
"Do you think." and the- big sailor
looking man was hoarse with earnestness,
"do you think you could teach me to
READ?"
"I think soâ if you want to learn."
"I had a friend who came hereâ and hÂ«
learned. That's why I came. I thought
maybe if he could learn I couldâ and
there's a lot o' things I'd 'ike to know
about, and the only way to find out seems
to be by readinV
We who read as easily as we babble
can scarcely realize what a closed and
sealed world this is to those who have
not that little key of magic.
The sailor-looking man went to night
school and in a very little while he came,
with tears in his eyes and a strange won
der in his voice, to his friend the princi
pal, with his First Reader in his big
h-.uid.
"Say," he said almost awesomely, "say,
I think I'm learuin.' I've got so that I
know some o" these here wordsâ l can tell
them from the other words."
The principal said the kindly words of
encouragement U-at a wise and good man
who understands knows haw ,to say la
times like that, and the man learned not
only to tell apart the words in the First
Reader, but to aead in the Second. And
then he had to go away to sea again He
took his Second Reader w*ui him and the
principal gave him also the Third, and
when he came back from his long voyage
he could, read tight through from cover to
coverâ hu could READ at last.
We who have had our First Reader
education spunked into us can never
know the joy that triumph brought to
the big sailor man.
The night school, with all its pathos
of struggle and self-denial, is not with
out its humors.
In one of the primary classes a col
ored lady by the name of Mrs. Rebecca
Smith was enrolled.
In honeyed contralto she confided to
her teacher that:
"De only reason what foh I cpme to
school is jus' dis â I want3 # to luhn to
write mah name, jus' nuffln* but to
write .mah name." . \u25a0'.-Â£*.-.
'.'Why, that ought to be easyâ but why
do you want to learn only to 'write your
name?"
"It's lak dis',". explained the colored
lady, "I'se put some money in de bank,
an* ,yo* know you's got \u25a0to write yo'
name when yo* does dat, Especially
when yo' wants to get it out. Ah got
mah money into de bank easy miff, for
I had a frien' writ my name foh me,
an.; I took it there. Dose folks at the
bank ust me to writ mah name again
.an* so I took de pen and made some
scrf*ches jus" lak people does when dey's
writin'- an* I give it to dem. Dey ast
me what dat was an' I said, 'Why, dats
Mrs. Rebecca Smif, uv course.* Den dey
all laffed. So I jus' made up my mln*
dat I'd luhn to write mah name shuah
nuff, foh I went back againâ an* dar's
why I jus' wants to luhn to write mah
name."
The teacher toiled with her and wroto
yards of copies for her for three lons
months, but "Mrs. Rebecca Smith",re
mained as far beyond her reach aa at
first.
"Suppose." suggested the teacher, "wo
make your name shorter; suppose we
leave out part of it? We can leave out
'Rebecca,' you know." -. â¢'.
"Yassam, dafs a good, ideeâ to make It
shorter, but' if any thing's lef* out let's
leave out de Smif. Smif he ain't no good
nohow. He ran away to de Klondiek,
an* I ain't never heerd . uv him sence. So
if any thing's bes' lef* it's de Smif!"
A singularly interesting- fact about the
night schools is thisâ that of the 6000
pupils in attendance only one-fifth are
women and girls. The tight for education
is made by the boys and men In a pro
portion of four to one as compared with
the girls.
To speak of the; night schools and say,
;no word about the teachers would be unÂ»
just, for nowhere does such a bond of
sympathy exist between teacher and puplt
as in the night schools. It is perhaps be
cause to many of the teachers, like the
boys, are , making a struggle â¢to get on.
The two hours' teaching every night doe*
not.of course, command the same salary
as the, work in the day schools, and mani
oc the teachers in the nhgfct Â» schools are
young > men and young women â¢ fitting
themselves for; or establishing them
selves in a profession and teaching whllo
they: are making their^own fight. There
is an understanding born of knoMedga
that in- these cases brings teacher and.
pupil {very ' close ' togetherâ to benefit
of both."MRS. SHANKIN'S
AMBITIONS
(Ccpyrlght by the S. 8. McClure Co.)
Vâ VDWARD SHANKLIN sat in his
J kitchen door and looked moodily
j f at the chickens cluttering and
|J cackling below him. He and his
t*.' /, wife were disagreeing, and he
had reached that age in life where it up-
sets a man to disagree with his wife. He
â¢ leaned over to the pan of empty pods be
side him, picked out a handful and slung
them far beyond the quarrelsome chick
ens. They scuttled after them greedily.
"There you go." said Mr. Shanklin acri
moniously, "tearing off after something
you don't want, don"t like, and that may
give you the gaps, anywa3'."'
"If It's me you are talking at, Ed
â¢ward," said Mrs. Shantlin . instantly,
though her head v.as half In the, oven. "I
do want it, will like it, and I'm not afraid
of the gaps. That's the whole trouble
vith you. Edward; you are afraid: if
'tten't the gaps, it's something else." Mrs.
Shanklin banged the oven door and rose
to an upright position. She came over to
the open door and looked out beyond the
chickens The wheat fields rimpled up
to the hills, ar.d the hills rolled back,
high and green, into the blue of a Mis
souri sky.
There was promise of a brilliantly warm
day in the air, which Quivered with an
electric Intensity. The very beauty at
seme Missouri deys has been known to
Quicken even quiet pulses uncomfortably.
Mrs. Shanklin did not have a quiet
pulse, and, standing in the doorway, she
interlaced her bony fingers vehemently.
,= " 'Tlsn't only because I'm so tired of it
out here, or because of the inconven
iences, cr because of anything so
much, as it's because of Ellzaoeth." Her
vclce b^gran to shake with feeling. "I
wish you would tell me, Edward Shank
lin, I Just wish you would tell me what
you yourself count on for Elizabeth If
we stay on out here. Isn't she to have
any pleasure, any schooling, any girl
friends^-any young men friends?"
Mr. Shanklin put one of the succulent
pp<!s In his mouth and chewed it reflect
ively. It always seemed to him unneces
sary and disturbing to go rooting into
the future the way his wife did. He was
ready to admit that Elizabeth must be
educated, and that she must have pleas
ure and friends, but when his wife be
gan to project the Shanklin household
out of its old habits toward these con
summations for Elizabeth, that minute
he became woefully unhappy.
"What's to hinder Elizabeth from hav
ing friends out here?" he asked at last,
with a dogged twist of his head that
pointed to and made much of the beauties,
and the comforts of the farm.
"What's to hinder?" mocked his wife.
"Do you suppose for one minute, Ed
ward, that Penangton boys are coming
out here to see Elizabeth, and going to
take her in to town to parties when
there's fifty girls handier?"
"I drove out of town to see you, Mary,"
suggested Mr. Ehanklin remlnlscently.
""TXentucky ant Missouri, and Missouri
roads ant Kentucky roads. Oh, you go
on and talk me down, Edward." Mrs.
Ehanklln's voice rose to a nervous wail,
thin and taut. "Talk me down. I know
your father and mother lived, here before
you. I know they dug the well and built
the smeke house, and I know how fond
your mother was of the spring house, and
I know you think what was good enough
for your father and mother ought to be
good enough for us. Well, I'm. Just plain
to say It ant good enough. I want
Elizabeth should have better."
She turned from the door and sat down
â¢In the chair by the kitchen table with
her hands still knotted together. She
.had had so many times In her life to
watch what her husband said In order
to twist it Into another reason for mov
ing" into town, or for getting a piano for
Elizabeth, or for building an L, that she
had got a birdlike alertness â she
seemed always just ready to pÂ«Â»ck.
"It Isn't only that you are so timid
about planning yourself, Edward, it's
that you make everybody else timid. If
''twerent for you I'd have had many a
thin* over and done long since, and all
the good of it ours; but let a thing so
much as fly my lips, bat It to the ground
you will. If we weren't able to move to
town and give Elizabeth a chance I'd
feel different; but we are able"â she took
la the rpring house, and the smoke house,
end the well as she finished, and her
slim, eharp face contracted still moreâ
"and we got to go," ehe said.
After dinner was over Mr. Bhanklin
west cto the back porch to smoke there,
in full view of the spring house, end
fortify himself by regarding it Mrs.
. Bhanklin called In Hester and Jefferson,
and turned the kitchen over to the former
with relief. The day fairly swirle<Vwlth
heat at this noonday hour, and her head
had begun to ache. As she left the
kitchen her eyes rested for a moment
with surreptitious envy on the two
darkles, who were already Installed Be
fore the cornbread and shoulder with
beaming content.
"Just to be satisfied like that." said
Mary Shanklin to herself. "Well, what
we have out here Is Just about enough to
satisfy people like that." She went across
the porch and Into the sitting room to lie
4pwn. "Cows end plgÂ»â milk end creamâ
hog-killing time and harvest"â the words
went scurrying through her head as she
paseed her husbandâ "butter and eggs,
swill and fodder." Her head waa in such
a whirl she could hardly reach the' sofa.
Later on she was dimly -conscious that
some one came in and closed the shut
ters and put a wet towel on her head.
It was not Elizabeth. Then she slept.
Bhe awoke with a sensation of having
slept a long time, and a conviction that
it must be nearly night. The room eeemed
pitch dark. She could hear overhead the
sound of hurrying feet and the banging of
shutters. Her headache was quite gone,
and she got up and stepped to the porch
briskly. .
"Elizabeth! Elizabeth!" she called as
Ehe got to the outer door.
"Yes'm," tame Elizabeth's voice from
the upper story. "There's going: to be a
storm, mamma, and we. are shutting up."
From the porch Mrs. Shanklin could
see the storm gathering. Through the
<3!nlng-room door the clock on the mantel
pointed to half-past 4. She remembered
that distinctly, and it was well she. did.
as ehe was asked about the hour a thou
sand times afterward. She hurried on
into the dining-:~om and drÂ«w the. shut
ters in there
"Don't forget the windows in the spare
room, Elizabeth," she called. up the.stair
way, "la you pa "up there, Elizabeth?
Where's Hester and Jeff?"
Elizabeth and Mr. Shaklin came to the
head of the stairs.
R. E. YOUNG
"JefT and Hester are in the cabin," said
Mr. Shanklin. "Better call them to' the
house. Clouds look mighty ugly out west
here. Cyclone 1 , maybe." His voice
sounded as though he had forgotten about
the morning, and Mrs. Shanklin found
herself secretly glad that he had. She
went back to the porch and looked around
the horizon again. The whole sky to the
east was an evil, vaporous yellow that
dropped low to earthward, withering and
blighting like sulphuric fumes. In the
yellow glare the leaves on the trees
looked /ghastly, afraid for their lives. To
the west the clouds were banded In an
ominous cohort, black, still, sulky. Mrs.
Shanklin " could hear the horses in the
barn pawing restlessly, and now and then
a wailing whinny cut across the rank,
burdened air. She saw Hester and Jeff
come to the uoor of the cabin, and she
put her hands to her mouth to shout to
them to run for it to the shelter of the
house. The darkies, however, waited for
......
no bidding, but tore across the yard and
burst into the kitchen, their eyes dilated
with fear. . ,
"We cert'n'ly â¢ are gwlne be hjew. Into
kingdom come. .Miss Mary." said" Jeff.
"Better come way fm dat do*. Lightnen
mightly li'ble. to. fetch you a.llck dar'."
Hester had sunk .into a chair, and the
great voice, which had. rolled and soared
so bravely In the sunshine, shrilled" out
now In a hysterical ' falsetto' as ; the : dls-.
asters of the hilU skipping like lambs
bore in -home. \u25a0 -. . '\u25a0'-â¢ ' . .

A strange thing was happening.- The
clouds in the west -were for one mo
ment convulsed by a great heaving and
splitting, and then straight out of their
ranks, like some mighty projectile shot
from some mightier cannon,. came ' \u25a0 the
funnel cloud â swift, sure, deadly. Mrs.
Shanklin's scream was swallowed 'up
in the .weird yell of the negress and
the stentorian roar of Black Jeff. There
was a sucking trough of wind,; and
while they crouched back. to the door
the storm bulled clove Its path through
the back yard with the unreckonlng, *
inexplicable. deviltry of its kind. Dur
ing, the, wild minutes of that wind
orgye the air was thick with .outbuild-/
ings, with "livestock,/ with fences, , with
fowls and things. V It i was as
though the farm had. been . picked } up :
and reset In the clouds. As ; : Mrs.
Shanklin watched,* awestruck, she be-
came conscious that the. elements: of
the air had somehow taken side- with
her, and, noting that her husband! had
joined her and was .Watching: over^her
shoulder, she felt guilty and /treacher-*
ous. ' They saw the" \u25a0 smokehouacj
wrenched to pieces, plank by plank, -as
it seemed; they saw a horse that had
dashed into the stable yard picked up
bodily and laid across a five-barred
fence which led into the lower pasture,,
and then they saw two small, shed
like buildings whisked up on the wings
of the wind and go skyhooting ln,to ;
the air. Crash followed upon crash
as trees and great- branches of trees
fell groaning to the ground. The hoot
calls of the owls in Hickory Wood
rang out in unceasing: protest. ... Then
came a strange flashing as the wlirl
swell swept on over the hill Into Hick
ory Wood. The rain started In tor
rents and the, cyclone] was over In so
far aa the Shanklin \u25a0 farm was con-
cerned. Mrs. Shanklin looked again at
;the dining-room clock. It was 4:83.,

'-v- Mary*- Shanklin '\u25a0 was â¢ &. Brood ! mother . Ac-
cording to her lights, and Elizabeth was
not entered at the academy in Septem
" ber. Just how much it cost Mrs. Shan -
lin to see Elizabeth . reduced to the rank
and file' of "girls "who stop school when
they have learned ; to . read and write it
would; be hard to estimate. Like many
another mother she bad hoped her daugh
ter could* do what she herself had never
succeeded In, doing, and.it was aa hard
to give up the; hope as though she had
heavily endowed Elizabeth for this very
achievement." Elizabeth's young face waa
still rather pale, however; so Mrs. Shank
lin kept the disappointment conscien
tiously to herself.. the rather that Eliza
beth certainly did. not look much grlevea
over the doctor's decision.
! The nexttwo years were, on the whole,
pleasant j years ! for the Shanklins. Mrs.
Shanklin had' Elizabeth ' take up music,
and; although it .waa rather hard to stand
the practice, when Elizabeth got so she
could . play "Silvery Waves" even Mr.
Bhanklin felt in a measure recompensed.
It was pleasant to sit on the front porch
and hear the piano notes float out. One
evening while she was. playing, and her
.father and '\u25a0 mother.' were listening out
side,; Elizabeth heard her own name men
, tlohed.-* Her./wrists; wefe ; not strong, so

"She's so timid, Mary"â Mr. Bhanklin
had at -last found .his side of the fence
again. "She's so timid that I don't be
lieve she ever will take to men much. I
don't for my life see how you are. going,
to get her started out with these boys.
Maybe you know; I don't.
From , the picture . galleries to Penang
ton, from the knights to the young men
of the academy, was a long Journey. .
Elizabeth's, father- had unwittingly
turned the key on the door-of her ro
mances, and the knights stepped discon
solately back into their frames. The lit-,
tie maid , whom \u25a0 they had thus described
felt very much shaken and afraid, as she .
harkened on to her father and- mother, '
and her; hands \u25a0 rested quite idly on the
piano keys.
."You leave â¢me to manage. Edward,"
said Mrs. Shanklin.. "I'll get her-start

1 .Whether 1 the assured determination of
her . mother roused some latent force of
homologous kind in Elizaveta, or whether
Mrs.> Shanklin had at last set Elizabeth's
" face toward something Inherently Impos
sible, certain it is that Mary. Shanklin
had. never in her life. undertaken a task
so utterly difficult as that of, getting
Elizabeth started. :\u25a0 She tried, to neglect
: nothing that (.would be | of any advantage.
She v got Elizabeth some new dresses; and
sho kept ' her out on the front porch a
great deal. It was her idea to have Eliza
beth go to the front gate and bans; over
it , in a careless '; sort \u25a0:-. of way about 6
o'clock evenings, this being the hour at
which the academy boys and other Pa
nangton young men went home to supper.
Xot a great deal was accomplished In this
way, however, because as. soon as Eliza
beth saw a young man coming she got
around behind 'the syringa bush and hid
until he had passed by.'; A game of croas
purposes seemed finally to be In" opera
tion between mother and daughter.
Every tnlng } that * Mrs. Shanklin counted
upon as & lever, for/ Elizabeth, for one "
reason or another proved ineffectual.
It was at this tims that Mr. Shanklin.
who had always been a well-liked man in
his community,: 2?s%ims the Incumbent off
the County Clerk'^offlce. He : fell f or th- ;
with" Into : the /custom, honored of his
BredecessorsiTjf Heaving -the office, pretty \u25a0
much to his deputy.* This gave him time
to f go '-. out to ; the ' farm' In ;. the ' afternoon
and â¢ge t : back : before dark/; It had been
such: an -easy /matter for nzm to ,ge^ the
clerk's \u25a0 office, \ and ; the emoluments ot \u25a0 the
office : .were such a pleasant matter, Ithat
Mr.-; Shanklin had found himself/ unable \u25a0
to regret -the farm as . much as ]he had
expected to."- - Besides," Jhe had t& admit
that >lU was more convenient "to live in
town. He had the farm profitably rented,
and : what ; with '; the rentj and ' his office,
he was enjoying a season of prosperity
that ; he ,had ; not - known \u25a0 in" the* country.
He was very cheerful," and his back had
got -up out -.of the farm-like stoop. _He
took Elizabeth a with t him ;to tne country
nearly" \u25a0: eyery^ day, and " they \u25a0 had a " great
deal of 'enjoyment "out "of ; the ride there
and .back." Mary; Shanklin '. would" seldom
go. *? One*. October 'evening the" Shanklins,
f a ther.-and ; daughter," were Jogging down ;
Weaver * road Ito "the farm, when It sud
denly- came ) upon j Edward > Shanklin that .
he had \f or ; a great many /years opposed,
a move that had la the end ; proved to be
In every way .'to -his, advantage. He be
came- conscious â¢' of ia / little glow toward
his vwif e. . He) turned to "k" k Elizabeth :
. "Are " you :. sorry.^we .ain't Hying out '
here'; now, /Elizabeth?" ;he. asked in a '
slow,*. humorous -tonel, . â¢;Â£,
".1 Elizabeth, 'thought'. a good while ;be-
fWe she 'answered: "I don't think I
am. I like It in town better." \u25a0 She
stopped and thought things ovar-la her
careful way. "At least I will if mam
ma Â» doesn't \u25a0 give me that party,"' she
said. \u25a0 "c - -
"Is your ma going to give you Â»
party?" asked Mr. Shanklin in a trouÂ«
bled voice. , *i'A%
"She says she is/ answered Elizabeth
with more trouble In hers.
. "If Elizabeth had surprised her
mother somewhat- that year, she had
surprised her father still more. She
surprised him most of all when she now
said further, "But I don't think Tllgo
to lt.'^
Tne next" morning" Mr. Shanklin be
come further acquainted with the "mix
up." ' He never.bothered to get to his
office very early, but sat on the back
porch and smoked or whittled for a
time. Mrs. Shanklin and Elizabeth
were usually in the dining-room at that
hour, rubbing the silver or counting
the spoons and forks, 'and they could
talk out the window to him. To-day
they seemed to be talking to themselves
on the inside, somewhat to his exclu
sion.
"Do you think jam* cake would be
\u25a0better than lemon. Elizabeth?" she
asked incisively.
'There was so much frank finality In
Mrs." Shanklin's way 'of putting; the
matter; 'so much that" meant to walk
over -so- -much/ els*. J and the 'reply was
so long: In 'coining that "Mr. Shanklin
- uncrossed- his legs restlessly."
\u25a0 ; -"One's as good* as another, I gu*sv*
Elizabeth* said at last.' The pent-up
tone, something In the slim, contracted
face. Its habitual look of animation en
hanced now by pallor,' the stiffness of
Its habit, bore in the' fact of her daugh
ter's limitations to Mary Shanklin with
sudden.' unwonted directness. â¢* An ex
tremefear of fate ran through her. as
she turned bacfc to the forks with cha
grin and dlsapointment on her face.
"You might take a little more In
terest, Elizabeth," was all she said.
There was a quiver In the room, the
' quick-laden monrent before an out
break, and then Elizabeth began to
talk pantingly.
"Oh. I suppose I might, mamma. Bat
I don't. I hate It.' That's all. I don't
" want 'any party. . I don't want-to go
out In society. I don't want to meet
young 1 men. I don't want to marry."
She had put^the spoons down and was
talking now from the folds of her;
apron. . "You made me go to" school
.until you nearly killed me.' You never
did anything much at school, and papa
never did. but'you expected! raÂ» to. Just
the same. You made me taka muslo
when I haven't any talent for muslo
and knew the teacher was laughing- at
me all the time, and now I suppose you
won't rest until you've pushed me into
parties v-hen I hate them. I'm not that
kind of. a girl, and I can't help it. X
never will be. Yet you've got to male*
me miserable because you want mÂ» to
be that kind. Youâ^ou've made .me
miserable all my life' \u25a0**
Elizabeth's tears had come so rarely
In her life that . they were ixnpresslT*.
Besides, .for Mary Shanklm they were
washing away tha .very .foundations of
those castles in tha air to whlca. shs
had flown for. comfort through all thesa
years. It was a sorry sight to fee them
go. their. lh?*ibility & sorry truth to
come drlf ting home os the high \u25a0 tleS Â»
of Elizabeth's tears. * Yet \u25a0omethin*
more ancestral and vitaleTtn than her

AUGUSTA PRESCOTT
NEW YORK. Oct. 2S.â The Duchess cf
Mai iboroi:g"h has been visiting in a re
markably pretty Â«=uit. It is quite an Eng
lish visiting gown, and in texture, color,
style and general adaptability it is as
neat a garment as one would want to
â¢ee.'-'w'v
The color of this grown, while not origi
nal. Is* very well suited to Its mission. It
is a navy blue, rather bright In tone,
though not as brilliant as royal blue, and
the material with which it is trimmed is
a dull gr*en. So. In a gown of navy
blue serge suiting, trimmed with dull
green broadcloth, the American duchess,
the prettiest of all the titled American
women and the most romantic and at
tractive in every way. has been paying
her calls in her native land. The gown
is her ideal, one in which she wants to
have her friends see her.
When Mrs. Clarence Mackay came to
town the other day from I^ong Island she
wore a dress r.hich was as charming as
any that has been seen recently. It was
in a deep shade of purple broadcloth, and
its trimmings consisted of tiny pipings
of lavender. The suit was made in the
tashionable new styk. which shows the
three-quarter coat very tight-fitting and
!>nng ill tne way from the neck to ths
foot. This new long, tight-fitting gar
ment is of the coat variety, for it is made
with coat sletves, snug shoulders,
. trsmmrd waist and tiyht-titting hips. It
is stitched iill around the neck and the
sleeves, and its outer edge was what is
'cilled a tailored finish. It is a good coat
for either the society woman or the
'â¢working girl.
If you are building a suit these days for
winter, why, >ou cannot do better than
select a tight-fitting mode. The long,
loose cloak is fashionable, but, on the
other hand, the tight fitting one is equal
ly so; ajid. as to the appropriateness of
the two for every -day wear, there is no
question at all. The three-quarter tight
fitting coat can be worn on almost any
occasion, while the loose cloak is. en
tirely too dressy for every-day wear.
tÃet-n^en the two there Is something that
compromises in the shape of a coat
which lits very tightly in the back and
across the shoulders, -while it hangs
rather lors* in the front, something like a
straight-fronted English ccat.
Whvt the UebutaÃtca >VÂ«ir.
The debutantes of the season are ex
tremely smart and the accusation has
be^n made of them that they are out
<iv^ezins their elders. Miss Deacon, the
beautiful Newport girl, whose sister.
Gladys Deacon. . has attracted a great
dtal of attention abroad, appeared In
town the- other day in a tight-fitting
blacli broadcloth, thp very neatest any
ur-.c could possibly hope to see. It was
as snus as a riding habit and as devoid of
spaTe material. It fitted her right down
to the ground, as the faying is: and as
she walked there was a curious willowy
appearance as though she were very
much taller than she really is.
Another debutante. Miss Cynthia Burke
Roche, has been in town dressed in a
tight-fitting tailor-made. Miss Burke
Roche aftVots brown a preat deal and her
hew suit is a very pretty golden brown
of th.. tu-w tint, which is a deep Italian
gold, rather dull and in certain lights al
most bronze. Her suit is made with im
mensely wide shoulders and hijrh puffed
Eleeves. which look as though there, was
crinoline in them. The cuffs are em
broidered ones, bcins composed of ex
quisite Japanese embroidery, done by han l
upon mandarin silk in many colors. There
is a wide turnover collar of the same de
scription, with pointed' lapels to match.
With this there is worn a narrow leather
girdle, fastened in front with a Japanese
clasp.
Another very handsome costume is
worn by Miss Gladys Vanuerbilt, tlrc
newest debutante of the family and the
greatest catch in society. Miss Vander
â¢ tiilt is wearing an Immensely chic black
costume, black from head to foot, with
only s tiny suggestion of white in the
pipings and in me white buttons, which,
by the way, are covered button molds, all
..embroidered by hand. When the coat Is
unbuttoned and thrown back there Is
disclosed a very handsome white satin
vest, with an embroidery of raised black
flowers. This very mat costume, which
is called a trotting suit, can be seen al-
CAPTURE OF A CRUSTY UNCLE
MISS KENT stood in the hos
pital doorway and repented of
her folly.
Six months before she had
resigned a position as under
nurse in a Xc-w York hospital for that
of superimcndent,or head nurse in a hos
pital In the heart of West Virginia's
mining district.
The deadly monotony was getting on
Marion Kent's nerves. At St. Paul's
there had been no monotony.
The surest cure for Miss Kenfs present
mental condition was work, activity, and
a patient, who was at least interesting.
She fc!t a wild inclination to go Into the
convalescent ward and stir up the men,
stolidly sleeping even before the night.
At. this Earn? moment she glanced down
the road which led from the railway
tuition and saw that the superintendent's
tar, attached to the construction train
engine, was slowing up by the~ water
tank. A cot was carried out of the car
and four bearers brought out a limp
figure swathed In a blanket. Another ty
phoid patient, no doubt, probably a little
worse than ordinary or the special would
not have been called, into service.
She was further surprised- a few mo
ments later to find herself greeting : the
superintendent of the mining company.
"I want you to give this case particu
lar care. ~He is young Jack Stanton,
nephew of Mr. Grimm, president of our
company. It is the came old story of ty
phoid, and, though I warned Mr. -Grimm
that it would come, I feel responsible for
the boy. GJvc him the best nurse you
bavt and as much of your own time as
you can spare."
"Vou'caU him a boy?" said Miss Kent.
"Yes, he is only eighteen. Between our
selves, Grimm claims the youngster ' has
made him a lot of trouble. lie didn't
l:!;c school, and so Grimm sent him down
hero to learn the coal and. *uke business
from the beginning. You'll find him
icthcr a decent sort of patient, and for
heaven's sake uon't let anything happen
most any afternoon on upper Fifth aver
nue, as its pretty wearer goes out for ber
constitutional. Â«
There are In Xew York this"yÂ«ar nine
other Interesting debutantes, and to
watch their costumes and not their prog
ress along fashion lines is one of tue
most fascinating of studies.
Handsome Original Gowus.
Miss Fish wore the other day a dress
which from* a distance looked precisely
to him. Grimm seemed glad enough to
ship the boy on to me, but just tha same,
I don't imagine he will be any too gentle
with me if anything goes wrong."
Ten minutes later Marion Kent was in
the private ward in which young Stanton
had been placed. He. had just received
a cooling sponge bath and he looked at
her with eyes that shone with some
thing beside fever. "My, but that felt
good, ar.d it Is awfully jolly, don't you
know, to see a woman's face again."
Miss Kent turned up the lamp a trifle
and bent over her new- patient. It
seemed to her that she had never
looked into so marvelous brown eyes
eyes that could jt\yinjile < and dance and
hide the deepest*'^G(UC;teiiderest of feel-
Ing. She glanced\j!rom them" to the
boyish features, f > 4tant6'n lifted his
hand weakly and felt of his chin.
"I wanted 'em to give me a shave be
fore they brought me down. I. knew I
would give you women an awful .start.
I look so like a tramp." #
\u25a0 Here was novelty with a vengeance
â a patient who cared how he looked
In tue presence of the nurses.
Miss - Kent kat down beside him. She
felt somehow as if she ought to ad
dress him as *a willful boy. .
"You know, this Is sort of a low fe
ver you have, and you'll get very tired
cf it. and of os â "
"Not of you, you bet. Say, did you
ever sleep on the hard i^ide of a straw
tick?"
Miss Kent shook her head and con
tinued her little moral lecture. "I just
want you ,lo realize that while you
don't feel very sick; you're liable, to
be a good deal worse if you; are not a
good patient." , - '
And Miss Kent did watch him,close
ly; more, as a psychological â¢' study ; than
as a patient. Without asking, ques
tions, bit by bit she pieced together. the
history of his boyhood. 'She saw: the
business-like, uncompromising /attitude
of his, uncle, to whom the boy had ; been
left . as a . legacy ' by his ; dying j mother.
The wealthy, bachelor had given ; freely
of his money, but .not of Jhl.T sympa
thy.' He .had r made; no effort to'under
stand -the boy, to establish intimate
relations with him. If teachers â¢ and
like a Japanese kimono. As you irtm
near her you saw, however, 'that it' was
a street suifc made ; in. the very latest
European 5 deiign. I } The : material, which
tutors had said that the boy. was lazy
or indifferent, he had. accepted the* crit
icism without question. She was mor
ally- certain he, had never looked' Into
those luminous brown' eyes and read
the truth. V" " ;/ ~ ; / \u25a0 \ :

The empire cloak doe 3 not look well over
a loose dress. . It should be worn .over
somethli.gr which is as snug a3 wax.
Then, and then only, will it be pretty.
They are making gowns especially
to wear under .the empire dress, and
one of the prettiest of these is a per
fectly plain black tailor-made dress,
tight fitting as to the waist and with a
snug skirt. The foot flare is not very
pronounced and the gown is from head
to foot as scant as the present fashion
willSpermit. Over this, there is worn
the "long, full empire cloak, with its
high waist. Its full shirring. Its im

without cuffs and these,- as a rule, de
pend upon handsome stitchery to fin
ish: the wrists. ;>' One very pretty dress
was; finished with a wide band of
leather around.:" the 1 wrist/ Thi3 was

It is said that; the street dress win
be' very quiet and that" the street petti

father terse way 'of,; describing- ,the
handsome new petticoats' whichV are

./iThe truth of. the i matter Js'.thatithe. new
gowns "-"absolutely ; require": the /'foot ; flare
and in order; to r obtain' it^they '. must see ' a
great : many i ruffles 'underneath. â¢ A few of
the hew gowns have \u25a0\u25a0 invisible ruffles
sewed on around the foot in such a way
that they make the skirt set out; others
depend entirely upon the flare of the pet
ticoat.
"I am looking for a skirt with a pic
ture flare." said a woman to a salesgirl
in one of Jhe large department stores
the other day.
"I want a petticoat which flares like
the skirt one sees in the pictures, but
which one never sees in real life."
The salesgirl smiled. "You cannot buy
such a petticoat," said she, "'unless you
are willing to pay 540. The truth is that
petticoats which flare around the foot
are built almost entirely of ruffles which
are, set on. one right over the other, until
there is a foot flare which absolutely
compels the skirt to stand out. When the
skirt is lifted these petticoats cascade
around the foot in charming arrayr* Of
course they should be dark and, if pos
sible, should, match the gown in color
otherwise they will not be in good taste."
It is very interesting to study the shop
windows these days, for not only axe
they beautiful but they are in good taato
as well. In onÂ© handsome department
store are six model gowns standing In
the front window. AH were cut along the
general style yet all differed in important
detail-?. The colors were In deep *Â«*.â
navy blue, old brown and the bright
shade of red which is a little lighter thaa
cardinal.
Inclined to Be Qnlet.
As a background to the different reds
and browns, there are the varying
shades of blue, which range all th-j
way up as light as Alice blue. Theso

with rhrfce-quarter cloak! tight fitting

snirt waist. Dilow there was a skin
Quite plain in its finishings, yet full
around the foot and trimmed perhaps
with braid or v/ith narrow siik. .
"There Is nothing very conspicuous
about the new street tiress." said a
modiste, handling the handsome stock
which she bad just unpacked, "and it
you will notice my Farts importations
you will see that they arw devoid of ec
centricity. F.xceyt fey the empirÂ«
stylos there is nothing new this fall,
and if you look at* the empire dresses
you see that even they are not abso
lutely -novel. They are slightly differ
ent rrom the dresses of last year, but
â¢ not suffieitently s*> to make a great
change."
Women who are wearing last year*
gowns this year â and a groat many can
plead guilty to this charge â find that
they can remodel the dress of last sea
son without a great deal of trouble.
If they will clasp a high girdle around
the waist and will alter tue neck so
that it is round and fiat, and if they
will flatten the skirt around the hips,
and make it full around the foot, they
will come very near to the new styles.
The plaid suits and the checks ara to
be very popular, but they should bÂ«
worn with much discretion. They look
well on small slender figures, but ara
abominable where one is large and (full
in the belt line. English women wear
these suits for the street because they
defy th*- fog. but in a pleasant land
they are best worn with dlscretionand
selected with care. You can so easily
go astray on a check or a plaid.
Miss Roosevelt In the Far East.
A lady, .writing from the Far Cast.
thus describes a visit of the Taft ex
pedition: "The entire party, dressed la
navy blue, called upon one of the high
officials of the Orient, and remained for
dinner. Their gowns were selected
with an evident eye to color without too
much restraint. They showed ,the vari
ous dark shades of blue relieved. by pip- ,
ings and other trimmings In red, white
and green. One dress was particularly
smart. It was worn by one of Secretary
Taf f s immediate party, a woman of
small stature and lithe figure. The coat
was cut in pajama shape. 'loose , and
trimmed with bands of burnt leather."
very thin and J decorated at each edge
with pipings of : silk. . The . shirt waist
was in tan and there were lovely Orien- *
tal trimmings upon It."
How delightful It'l3 that the*Per
-sian trimmings will "remain in vogue.
It Is so very difficult to find anything
that acts as. a substitute for them, try
as you will, you cannot equal the Orien
tal, materials In color.
. Said \u25a0, a manufacturer: - "It is true that
most of the Persian trimmings. are made
in this country, yet .we. are .willing. to glvo
credit to the Orientals for originality and
for design. "We cannot Invent anything
which comes up to ; their color scheme,
prepared apparently with such careless
ness, yet really so elaborately and. pains
takingly. We .who get up the .stuffs for
women are only > too happy to have the
lovely Persian T materials upon which to
draw ; for designs . and ' color ' schemes.
""We 'are 'making " more Persian bands
than ; ever this year. Though 'they bear

to -Persian designs. We have buttons
this season and mahy^other things which

THERE are two features In Scots
character \u25a0which seem to be con
tradictors*, but whose combination
- has made the Scot a successful
citizen of the world. One Is his
'â¢ passionate devotion to his country. He
"may take his way to the ends of the
earth, but wherever he travels the Scot
. carries with him, and bequeaths to his
children, and even to his children's chil
* Ctcn, the indomitable Scots accent, his
. admiration for Burns, his loyalty to the
â¬cots nation, and, although he may have
â¢le.ft her communion, his respect for the
Scots Kirk. Scotland is but a small
country in geography, but like Greece
and Palestine it has made its Influence
felt; in the history of the race. Because
It has been email it has been the easier
carried m the heart of its people, and
because it has also been a hard land, with
'a poor soil and a stern climate, and a
masterful Kirk, Scotsmen have been the '
stronger and more strenuous. A severe
"mother, Scotland has been a faithful
nurse of men and no land has been more
dearly loved by her exiles. Wherever
there are half a dozen in a city they
gather on St. Andrew's Cay to eat their
national dishes and hear the national
mutic, and above all, to toast their na
tive land, and, to do the Scots patriots
justice, to help their poorer lellow citi
zens. If any man writes worthily of
* Scotland, the Scots people to the end of
the earth will buy his books, and if any
man of their blood carries himself well
in the battle of life they will celebrate
his name.
A Loyal Exile.
It has been brought against Scotsmen
as a serious 'charge that they have helped
one another, but if it be creditable for
one brother in a large family, surely it
cannot be discreditable for one member
of a email nation to lend a hand to his
brother as they both fight the hard bat
tle of life. If Scotsmen do not as a rule
return to their native land when they
have made a little money, as Italians are
apt to do, and also Germans, they love
'to visit it when they have opportunity,
and they are persuaded that there is
nothing in all the world so beautiful as
the steely blue of a Scots loch, or the
gray sea breaking on the northeast coast,
or the purple and emerald of the heather

THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF ECONOMY
THE gentleman who enunciated the
sage dictum to the effect that a
penny saved was a penny earned
couldn't have been aware of the
mathematical implications of his
â¢tAUmcnt. Fcr in order that a penny
,/ay be saved it must first have been
earned; saving it earns it again, and
the frugal soul by all the laws of
arithmetic and reason should have two
pennies. Then if he goes on and saves
the penny that he earned by saving
the one that he earned the first time
he ought to have four pennies. By this
simple method a man might easily be
come a millionaire â or a lunatic â in a
short time and still have only the orig
inal penny, if some one hadn't stolen
that while he was buried in his mathe
matlco-financtal meditations. That's
the way trusts are organized, except
that they aren't always careful about
providing the original penny.
A saving friend of ours who might

Soot* to the Fore.
It was not yesterday that the Scot
set forth to win his fortune abroad. In
the .fourteenth century Duns Scbtu's,
the. first of 'a series of learned Scots
men,; went abroad, and carried the con
tinental /universities; by storm, distin
guishing himself first at the University
of Paris, where, according to Hill Bur
ton, he demolished- 200 of the knot
tiest syllogisms: of his adversaries,
â¢â¢resolving them," as a bystander said,
"as . easily as Samson unloosed the
bands of Delilah." and then he went
on to found the University of Cologne.
He" was called the "Subtle Doctor," and
also ; the i.Resolute. Doctor/ and 'so one
recognizes in this.^ancient scholar the
slgnmark of hlsvpeople. '. â Dugald Dal
getty was the type of 'many more dis
tinguished", men, who served |ln '\u25a0':', the
armies of France and Germany and in
the navy of Russia. Gustavus Adolphus
had thirteen regiments of Scots infan
try, and many of his . other regiments'
had Scots officers. The names of Mun

were .known over,'- the length- and

days, 'while, in a stiliearller day Scots

It-was ; inevitable that when James

double his business in a year by the
expenditure of a comparatively small

sees in George Heriot, the Jingling

forerunners of a continuous emigra

If one enters' the House of Commons
he finds the Prime Minister a Scots

It cannot be erased. When the first De
claration of Independence was submitted
to the Continental Congress and that body
hesitated It was a Scots minister who
gave the deciding voice, declaring,
"though these, gray hairs must soon de
scend to the sepulcher. I would infinitely
rather that they descend thither by the
hand of the executioner than desert at
this crisis the moral cause of my coun
try." About the middle of Â»the eighteenth
century Dr. John TVltherspoon was a
leader in the Scots Church, and In 1775 he
became principal of Princetown College.

ace Walpole alluded when he said la the

guide American affairs than Scotsmen
and their descendants.
.An Italian Scot.
One does not need, however, to study
history in order to appreciate the
world-wide Scot; one has only to
travel abroad. and to keep his ears open
to identify this persevering, deter
mined, narrow, accommodating inflex
ible citizen of the world. You flnd
yourself one morning on the deck of
an Italian steamer, dodging about
among the Greek Islands. The cap
tain, who sat at the head of the table
at the morning meal, â¢ was an Italian
and the crew appear to be all of the
same blood. You have mustered all the
Italian you know, and are doing your
best to discover from one of the sea
men why the steamer's bows show
signs of recent repair and to satisfy
yourself that she Is In safe condition.
It is a somewhat fragmentary conver
sation, and although both sides arc do
ing their best It is not quite as lucid
and informing as could be desired.
The mate of the steamer has joined
you and is listening unnoticed to this
effort at national reciprocity. Then
suddenly he breaks In with a powerful
accent which could only have been
reared in one country under heaven.
"Ye're Italian Is not so bad, but I'm
judgin' you wouldna object to get 4he
information ye're after in ylr own
tongue." â¢
It was my own tongue with a venge
ance and I regarded the speaker with
silent amazement, for he was the first
officer in an Italian steamer and he bad
also all the appearance of an Italian.
It came out that his father had been
a Scots captain in the service of this
line and had married an Italian woman,
so that my good friend was practically
an .Italian and had only once been in
Scotland, ? but â¢ his father had brought
â¢him up with a sound accent, and after
we grew friendly he asked some
searching questions about the condition
of the Scots kirk and produced with
much satisfaction a copy of the Dundee
Advertiser.

Two steamers are tied up together in
the Suez Canal, and the chief engineers,
the one of a P. and O. boat and the other
of a Messagerle. come up to air them
selves from the terrible heat below. The
one recognizes his fellow officer by the
broad band on his cap. and they draw
near to have professional intercourse. It
is always .pleasant for a student of human
nature to see the meeting of different
peoples, and when that Frenchman and
our Scots engineer approached one anoth
er you remembered the ancient alliance of
the two nations, and were touched with a
feeling of romance. "Which would speak
first and what would be said? It was the
Frenchman who, after a pause and steady
examination of our pronounced Scot,
opened the conversation and these were
his first words:
"Losh preserve us body and soul, is
that you, Sandy Robertson? Man, I heard
about ye, but I've never clappit eyes on
ye since we were working together at
Dumbarton." After giving some direc
tions in French to a subordinate that he
might not be interrupted, this exiled Scot,"
compelled to live (and no doubt earninaf a
good living) among frivolous Frenchmen,
demanded and received the latest infor
mation on the Robertson-Smith heresy,
case, the prosperity of Kirkcaldy, what
the "Scotsman" had been saying lately,
and what was the present condition of

(Copyright, 1904, by Albert Britt.>WHEJC Citizen Lent recently
threw himself to the fore and
proceeded to have Dairyman
Smart punished for the shame-
less adulteration of pure milk,
he' started an agitation that promises
This time to work some good for thfe local
â¢ ommunity. Although it is not the first
time that the discovery has been made
that dairymen were resorting to what
the latv of the municipality plainly terms
a. criminal act, it is the first time, thanks
to the determination of ilr.' Lent, that
public feeling has been strongly aroused
asrainpt the sale of milk that carries
matter dangerous to public health.
In the trial of Dairyman Smart it was
, trarly established that h? had been uÂ»

Ye had hardly received the punishment
imposed on him by the court before an
Â«'."her dairyman was accused of using an
â¢ \u25a0yt'.ally dangerous preservative matter 10
insure his milk against souring within
;he natural course, of time. While it
Ijas been a common practice for years
among many of the local dairymen to
adulterate their milk, the fact has sel
dom been brought to the attention of the
general public ir. a manner that would
provoke indignation. Occasional raids
upon the mlk wagons in the early hours
of vhe morning, as they were setting out
6n their rounds, have been made and
duly hcra^drd in the daily papers, but
there the interest of the public seemingly
cfaseu. Prosecution in the courts was
lax ar.J in a week's time the incident haJ
been forgotten.
In the most recent case, however, a
citizen, with his feeMngs aroused over
t?,f: lrnnofition practiced upon him and
h:s family by a man uhom he had paid
liberally, as the latter admts, for pure
ralik, took the matter to the court*.
where a Judge had courage enough to
properly interpret the law and ad
rrilr.isier it to the offender. Since then
the impure milk question has been wide
ly discussed. There is a strong public
i^clins that the laws of the State and
city, the first governing the sanitary Â«on
dition of all dairies, and the latter ap
riying more directly to the adulteration
of the milk, should be properly enforced.
All this has grown out of the sympathy
for . Mr. Lent, but how many citizens
t.ave realized how often they have them-*
reives been cheated by their dairymen,
snd in how many different ways.
. The present investigation has brought
to light the deplorable fact that the u?e
6f preservalines is not the only uniaw-
Jui practice that many dairymen are
Â»ullty of. rt is Known to nearly every
ob% connected with the business that
cheating In the quality of the milk sold
to tht public has been a common prac
tloe with milk sellers for years, and is
â¢till being resorted to as a means of
tncreasint; the profits of the dealer. Dilut
ing: milk with what is commonly known
as "color dope*' insures the dairyman a
earing of from 10 to SO cents on every
Ave- r allon can of milk he sees fit to sell.
It Is a custom of the dairymen to di
vk!e their milk into three grades before
distributing It among their patrons. These
friGes are designated as "straight,"
"family" and "wholesale" qualities. The
"straight" is a pure milk and is put out
among customers, who like Mr. I^ent are
willing to pay the highest price for the
fluid, and is generally from one cow. The
"family" milk is a second quality into
which the dairyman puts a pint and a
half of "color dope" in making up every
three gallons of milk for distribution. In
the third quality, or "wholesale"' grade,
the proportionate amount of color dope
used in making vo three gallons of milk
is five pints.
The "wholesale" grade of milk finds
it? way into the cheaper places of con-
EHmptlon, such as the poorer class of cor
ner groceries, small bakeries and restaur
ants of the city. One would Imagine that
after having once adulterated his milk
the dairyman would be satisfied, but
apparently he Is not. for when his wagons
return after the morning round, the milk
that remains In the delivery cans is
dumped Into a big vat and then dlstrlbut-
the smaller cans again. Allowing
H a reasonable time to set, about half a
pint of cream is extracted from each flve
eallon can, into which in then emptied a
half pint of dope, to replace the cream
extracted, and the badly adulterated milk,
Â«iih a necessary proportion of preserva
tive matter' to insure it against souring,
is pent forth again for distribution among
the p'.aces that do not feel like paying
the higher prices for milk to'be consumed
By their financially impoverished custom
ers. Usually this strangely mixed prbd
â¢ufct sells at retail for 6 cents a quart. .
Tht water concoction used to Increase
<he dairyman's commodity is a mixture
of which burnt sugar is the principal
part, and which he. buys already prepared
from establishments downtown. A_tea
spoonful of the sugar powder Is dissolved
in a pint of water and the preparation
is administered in one and a half pint
doses to make up every three gallons of
milk. Anticipating a possible raid from
the milk Incjpectors. who generally con
fine their tests to determining the amount
of butter fat that the milk carries., the
dairyman frequently sends out several
cans on his wagons, that are apparently
empty. Regarding them as such the milk
THE PURE MILK QUESTION
inspectors, when they "overhaul the
wagons, promptly pass these cans. The
cunning dairyman, knowing that they
will be ignored In the raid, has placed in
the supposed empty cans a liberal quan
tity of. his sugar and water, dope. Later,
when the driver of the wagon reaches a
customer's place of business he fills a
can containing the sugar and water from
a fresh can of milk, delivers it to his
patron and saves his employer a pint or
so of pure milk.
Gain the confidence of a dairyman with
whom sou have had no dealings and he
will tell you that the adulteration of the
city's milk In the manner mentioned
above is a common practice In San Fran

Women's Vagaries as Seen in Mail Orders
1F ever>'body in the United States knew
how to write and address business and
social letters there would be little use
for the Dead Letter Office at Washing-
ton, and the big departriient stores,
which .do a large mall order busi

are received every day, and many of
them contain money in various forms
and sums. The unsigned^and undated
letters asking that goods be sent CO.
D. are seldom traced, for the persons
who write them do not bother, to in
quire why the goods never come. Where
money is inclosed, however, there is
generally a "come back" in the way of.
a caustic letter of criticism of the rirm,
and this serves to locate the negligent
correspondent.
The mail order departments of most
of the big department stores which do
mail order business have handwriting
experts among their clerical force who
spend most of their time over what are
known In mail order parlance as the
"undeclpherables," ; for some writers
who make every attempt to give their
names and postoffice addresses do it in
such "hen track. writing that .they v

milkmen to sell their product to consum

themselves the dairymen who are guilty
of these unlawful practices generally deal
fairly. When one buys from . another a
can of milk he gets the pure article, but
before he has turned it over to his,cus

Milk has been sold wholesale In this city
as low as 35 cents a can. Sixty, cents be

the purchaser of 35-cent milk just 35 cents',
worth of pure milk, the balance of the

a clew to certain letters from which

To stop j these health-menacing prac

of the fact that impure milk v has- been

medical men that San Francisco is behind
the other large cities in thej matter; of
proper legislation thatalms to enforce the
sale of pure, milk only. In Boston, New

ern cities, the law is now so stringent re
garding the handling of milk that flagrant
cases; such as have recently been brought
to light in San Francisco, would result;in
the severe punishment of those who were
guilty of them. In those cities the adul

adopted, as a food preservative la 1330
and has -since Increased in that use at
an alarming: rate.
. According to the medical authorities
borax, when taken In auantitiea as
small as 7% grains a day, 13 too much
for, the normal man,* and one-twentieth
of that*amount, administered dally to
an Infant. ln milk or any other fluid,
id a dangerous experiment. Both boric
.acid and borax, writes one prominent
â¢Eastern scientist, when continuously
administered In small doses for a long
period, or given In large doses during
a short period, create disturbances In
the appetite, "the digestion and the
general health of the human being.
Another medical authority describes the
symptoms of both formaldehyde aÂ»J borio
acid poisoning in the grown person as a
feeling , of fullness and nausea and a
headache after eating.
The unfortunate infant, which Is unable
to comprehensively express Its feelings,
probably suffers the same ailments after
Its weak stomach has been filled with
adulterated milk and is taken up by Its
devoted mother and caressed under the
mild apprehension that it is suffering
' from the traditional colic or some other
trifling affection.
There Is every reason to believe -that
the present agitation against adulteration
has had a strong tendency to compel
dairymen to give their customers a better
quality of Â« milk, but among members of
the medical profession, who are natur
ally interested in the pure milk question,
the fear exists that the former unscru
pulous milk vender will not stay reform
ed unless he is confronted with legislation
that will pave the way for his going to
prison in the event of future offenses
against the community. To guarantee this
condition of affairs the State Board of
Health Is now considering various meas
ures affecting the purity of milk that will
be presented to the next ; Legislature for
its formal approval. At the last Legisla
ture the law-makers showed a disposition
to adopt any 'measure submitted to them,
by the State Board of Health, and there
is little doubt that the purity of milk
question will receive Its full share of con
sideration at the- next session.
Dr. Martin Regensburger. president of
the State Board, takes the stand that the
adulteration of milk should be governed
by a State statute providing for severe
punishment for all persons found guilty
of placing colorations or preservalines In
milk. He declares that the board is In
need of greater authority and more funds
to carry out its theories for enforcing
milk regulations. At the present time.
'he says, California has no adequate laws
bearing on the adulteration of milk and
the regulating of the sanitary conditions
of the dairies.
"If I had my way," said he. "I would
send every man who sells milk con
taining the slightest adulteration
across the bay for at least two years.
I believe that the dairy milk should
be tested for butter' fat and examined
for adulterants, but I think that a far
more Important duty confronts the au
thorities of the counties and cities, and
that is an enforcement, of some strict
rule regarding the sanitary condition
of the dairies and milk ranches. The
majority of those in and around San
Francisco are In a most disgraceful
state. They reek with filth that Is con
stantly breeding disease, both In the
cattle and the milk. Insure the clean
liness of your dairies and you will not
have to worry so much, about your
milk. If milk is pure it will not have
to be poisoned with preservative mat-
ter. Tne cleanliness of dairies and
their surroundings should receive the
same attention here that Is riven them
In New Tork State. We might make a>
great step forward If we would adopt
the method In vogue In New Zealand
and Australia, where dairymen arÂ» In
structed by the Government In tao
proper management of their places and
especially as to their hygienic condi
tion.
"Go out among; the dairies In tas
suburbs and throughout the Btata and
you will find hundreds of them whers
not the slightest attention Is paid to
sanitary conditions. Cows ' arc ' poorly,
fed and are huddled together for shel
ter In badly constructed and ventilated
barns, where they are milked by,mÂ«a
who are subjected to no particular
rules for personal cleanliness. No at
tempt Is made to sterilize thÂ« cans and
other receptacles Into which fresh milk
Is received. There is little wonder that
our milk la filled with germ-braedlnr
impurities.
"The same conditions existed for a lon*
time in New York City until the County
Medical Board took the matter up and
Induced a trustworthy *nftn to establish a
sanitary dairy. ThÂ» schema worked to
perfection. The entire product of the)
dairy is handled under the direction of
the County Medical Board. If a man
wants clean milk he la referred to the
headquarters of this dairy, and he gets
what he wants and needs. A similar pro
ject could be successfully carried out In
San Francisco: Of course, the milk would
cost a trifle more to the consumer, but it
is pretty certain that most every, one
would, readily pay an advance price if
they could be absolutely guarantied pure
milk. . ..;: â:\u25a0-.:
"The root of all this milk trouble. I be
lieve, is to be found in the neglectful con
ditions that ' exist at the dairies. In the
first place, the cows should be curried
and washed at intervals, as they are on
several: model dairies in thl3 State, and,
milked away, from the barns, where the
haydust-laden atmosphere and the germ
breeding floors of the shelter place would
have no opportunity of contaminating the
milk. Immediately after the milk Is
taken from the cows it should be bottled
and placed in a refrigerator and kept in
a cool atmosphere until It Is delivered to
the consumer. In this way, a most neces
sary precaution Is taken against the In
trusion of all forms of * bacteria, which
multiply at an enormous rate in milk.
The thorough sterilizing of cans and bot-.
ties "by steam before and after they re
ceive milk should . also be made compul
sory, as in other States.
\u25a0", "To enforce all 'the * necessary regula
tions there should be an educational sys
tem, under the direction of the Boards of
Health . or , Dairy Commissions. If -the
New York plan of conducting a sanitary
dairy under the direction of the County
Medical Boards were carried out 'it would
furnlah -' much :in the way of. Instruction
for, the other. dairymen. Of course.'many
of the -smaller dairies'.' would ' have \u25a0to
eventually., go ; out. of business, but It
might " be ; ,well \ that they should if I they
were unable to comply with' the modern
requirements of a sanitary nature." Clean
milk ' means -good health, and the '"sooner
the people^ of California-, realize that^fact'
the quicker -will they appreciate theneed
of - sanitary surroundings , of dairies \u25a0â¢ and
ranches whence their milk supply cornea."Monsieur Beaucaire

CHAPTER V.
â¢â N EA.U N^SH stood at the door of
V ) the rooms, smiling blandly upon
ITS & dainty throng in the pink of
P? J Its finery and gay furbelows. The
gzeni' exquisite bent his body
constantly in a series of consum
mately adjusted bows: before a great
dowager, seeming to sweep the floor
in august deference; somewhat state
ly to the young bucks; greeting the
wits with gracious friendliness and
a twinkle of raillery; inclining with
fatherly gallantry before the beauties;
the degree of his inclination measured
the altitude of the recipient as accur
ately &6 a nicely calculated sand-glass
measures the hours. _- -
The King: of Bath was happy, for wit,
beauty, fashion â to speak more con
cretely: nobles, belles, gamesters,
beaux, statesmen and poets â made
fairyland (or opera bouffe, at least) in
his dominions; play ran higher and
higher, and Mr. Nash's coffers filled up
with gold. To crown his pleasure, a
Prince of the Frence blood, the young
Comte de Beaujolais, just arrived from
Paris, had reached Bath at noon In
state, accompanied by the Marquis re
Mirepoix, the Embassador of Louis XV.
The Beau dearly prized the society of
the lofty, and the present visit was an
honor to Bath: hence to the Master of
Ceremonies. What was better, there
would be some profitable hours with
the cards and dice. So It was that Mr.
Nash smiled never more uenignly than
on. that bright evening. The rooms
rang with the silvery voices of women
and delightful laughter, while the fid
dies went merrily, their melodies chim
ing sweetly with the joyance of his
mood.
â¢ The skill and brazen effrontery of the
Ambassador's scoundrelly servant in
.passing- himself off for a man of con
dition formed the point of departure
for every conversation. It was discov
ered that there were but three, persons
present who had not suspected- him
from the firs^; and, by a singular para
dox, the most astute of all proved to
â¢â¢be old Mr. Bicksit, the traveler, once a
.visitor at Chateaurien; for. hi, accord
ing to report, had by a coup of diplo
macy entrapped the Impostor into an
admission that there was no such
place. However, like poor Captain
B-idger, the worthy old man had held
his peace out of regard for the Duke
of Winterset. This nobleman, hereto
fore secretly disliked, suspected of ir
regular devices at play, and never ad
mired, had won admiration and popu
larity by his remorse for the mistake,
and by the modesty of his attitude in
endeavoring to atone for it, without
presuming upon \u25a0 the privilege of his
rank to laugh at the Indignation of
society; an action the more praise
worthy because his exposure of the Im
postor entailed the disclosure of his
own culpability in having stood the
villain's sponsor. To-night, the happy
gentleman, with Lady Mary Carlisle
upon his arm, went grandly about the
rooms, sowing and reaping a harvest
of smiles. 'T was said work would be
begun at once to rebuild, the Duke's
country seat, while several ruined Jews
might be paid out of prison. ; People
g-azlng on the beauty and the stately
but modest hero by her side, said they
would make a noble pair. She had long
been . distinguished by bis attentions,
aiid be bad come brilliantly out of the
episode of the Frenchman, who had
been his only real rival. Wherever
they went, there arose a buzz of pleas
ing gossip and adulation.
Mr. Nash, seeing them near him, came
forward with greetings. A word on the
cide passed between the nobleman and
the exquisite.
"I bad news of the rascal to-night,"
whispered Nash. "He lay at a farm
till yesterday, when he disappeared; his
ruffians, ; too."
-You have arranged?" asked the
Duke. â¢
"Fourteen bailiffs ere watching with
out. He could not come within gun
bbot. If they clap eyes on him, they
will hustle him to jail, and his cut
throats shall not avail him a hair's
weight. The Impertinent swore he'd be
here by 9, did he?"
"He said so; and 'tis a rash dog, sir."
"It is Just 3 now."
"fiend out to'see if they have .taken
him.''.' .\u25a0- KBpBBkE
; "Gladly." The Ecaa beckoned an at
tendant, and whispered in his ear.
Many of the crowd had edged up to
the two gentlemen with apparent care
lessness, to overhear their conversation.
Those who did overhear repeated it in
covert sides, and this circulating under
tone, confirming a vague rumor that
Bcaucaire would attempt the entranojb
that night, lent a pleasurable color of
excitement to the evening. The French
Prince, the Embassador and their suites
were announced. Polite as the assem
bly, was, it was also curious, and there
occurred a mannerly rush to tee the
newcomers. La<ly Mary, already pale,
grew whiter as the throng closed round
her; she looked up pathetically at the
Diike, who lost no time in extricating
iier from the pressure.
"Wait here." be said: "I will fetch
you a glass of negus," and disappeared.
He had not tbought to bring a chair,
and she, looking about with an Increas
ing fain In ess and finding none, saw
that she ..was standing by the door of a
small side-room. The crowd swerved
back for the passage of the legate of
France; and pressed upon her. She
opened the door and vent in.
" â¢ The room was empty save for two
gentlemen, who were quietly playing
cards at a table. They looked: up as
she entered. They were M. Beaucaire
and Mr. Molyneux. . ,
She uttered a quick cry. and -leaned'
against the wall, her hand \ to \u25a0 her
breast. Beaucaire, though white /and
weak, had brought tier/a chair before
Molyneux could stir. .
"Madcmoiseileâ â '\u25a0
"Do not touch -me!" she said, with
such frozen abhorrence- In her: voice,
that he stopped' short. \u25a0 ""Mr. Molyneux,
you seek strange-company!'.'
"Madam," replied Molyneux, bowing
deeply, as much to -Beaucaire as to
herself, "I am honored by the presence
of both of you.'.'
"Oh, are you mad." she exclaimed,
contemptuously.
"This gentleman has exalted me with
his confidence, madam," he replied. ;
"Will. you add your ruin to the scan
dal of this fellow's presence here? How
he obtained entranceâ - â "'
"Pardon, mademoiselle," interrupted
Beaucaire. "Did I not say I should
come? M. Molyneux was so obliging as
to answer for me to the fourteen frlen's
of M. de AVinterset and Meestaire
Nash." * -. -^- 'jj :
"Do you not know," she turned ve
hemently upon Molyneux, "that he will
be removed the .moment 'I leave' this
room? Do you. Wish- to be dragged out
with him? For your- sake, sir," because
I have always- thought -you'a.man of
heart, I give you a cliance to save your
self from disgraceâ andâ your compan
ion from Jail. ,Let him slip out by, some
retired way, and you may give me
your arm and we will enter, the next
room as If nothing had happened. Come,
"Mademoiselle- " -
"Mr. Molyneux, I desire to hear noth
ing from your companion. Had I not
seen you at cards with him; l should
have supposed him m attendance as
your lackey. Do you desire to take
advantage of my offer, sir?"
"Mademoiselle, 1 could not tell you,
on that night â râ ".; '-':
"You may inform your high-born
friend, -Mr. Molyneux, that I heard
everything he had to say; that my pride
once had the pleasure of listening to
his high-born confession!"
"Ah, it is gentle to taunt one with
his birth, mademoiselle? Ah, no! There
is a man in 'my ; â¢ country who " " say
strange . things of thatâ that a ' man 13
not his father/ but 1 himself." ' ,
"You may-inform your; friend, Mr.
Molyneux, that he had a chance to de
fend himself' against accusation; that
he said all â ~-" - .. - \u25a0
'That I did say all' I could . have
strength to say. a. demoiselle, you did
not seeâ as it was rightâ that I had
been stung by a big wasp. It was
nothing, a scratchr'but, mademoiselle,
the sky went round and the moon
dance' on the earth.* I could not wish
that big wasp to see he had stung me;
so I mus' only say' what I can have
strength for, and stan' straight till he
is gone. Beside", there are other, riz
zons. Ah, you mus' belief! My Moly
neux I sen' for, and tell him all, be
cause he show courtesy to the yo'ng
Frenchman, and.* I can trus' him.: I
trus' -you, mademoiselle â long agoâ -and
would have tol* you everything, excep'
jus' because â well, for the romance, the
fon! You belief? It Is so clearly so;
you do belief,' mademoiselle?"
She did not even look \u25a0at him. M.
Beaucaire lifted his hand appealingly
toward her. "Can -there be no faith in
âIn â " he said" timidly, and paused.
She. was silent,- a statue, my Lady Dis
dain. . ,
"If you had not belief me to-be- an
impostor; if I had ; never said I was
'Chateaurien; .if I had been ' Jus' that
Monsieur Beaucaire of. the story . they
tol' you, but never , with, the heart of a
lackey, an hones' man, :a man, the man
you" knew, himself, could you â would
youâ" He was trying to speak firmly;
yet, as he gazed upon her splendid
beauty, he choked Slightly, and fumbled
in the lace at his -throat -with unsteady
fingers. â "Would youâ have let me ride
by your side in the autumn moonlight?"
Her glance passed by him. as it might
have passed by a % footman or a piece of
furniture. He was dressed magnifi
cently, a multitude of orders glittering
on his breast. Her eye took no k'nowl
- edge of him.
"Mademoiselleâ l have, the! honor; to
ask you: if you had known this. Beau
caire was hones', though, of peasant
birth, would youâ â -"
Involuntarily, controlled' as her icy
presence was, she shuddered. . There
was a moment of silence.
"Mr. Molyneux," said Lady Mary, "in
spite of your discourtesy in allowing a
servant, to address me. :I offer you a
last chance to .leave this room undis
graced. Will give' me your arm?"
"Pardon me, .madam," said Mr. Moiy
neux.
Bcaucaire dropped into a chair with
his head ' pent low and his arm out
stretched on the table- his eyes rilled
slowly In spite of himself, and two
tears ro) lowed down the young, man's
cheeks.
, '"An' live men. arc jus'- â names!" said
M. Beaucaire.
CHAPTEK. VI.
, In' the outer room, Winterset, unable
to find Lady Mary, and supposing her io
have joined Lady Rellcrton, disposed
of his negus, then , approached the â¢ two
visitors to pay his respects to the young
Prince, whom he discovered to be a
stripling of 17," arrogant-looking-, but
'pretty as a girl; Standing beside the
Marquis de â¢ Mirepoixâ a man of quiet
bearingâ he /was., surrounded, by a
group of the great, whom Mr.
Nash naturally counted himself. The
Beau was felicitating himself that s the
foreigners had not^ arrived *a' week
earlier, iii which case he and Bath
would- have been detected in a piece of
gross ignorance \u25a0 concerning ' the .French
nobilityâ making much of de Mlrepbix's
ex- barber.
",*Tis a lucky thing, that fellow was
got out of. the way,", he ejaculated,
under cover. .- \u25a0 .
"Thank me for it,"; rejoined Winter
set:
An attendant : begged: Mr. Nash's no
tice. The head bailiff - sent word that
Booth Tarkington
Beaucaire had long since entered the
buildings by a 'side, door! It "was sup
posed .Mr. Nash, had known .ot it, and
the Frenchman '.was riot .arrested,- as
Mr. .' Molyneux was in his company, and
said lie" would be answerable for him.

Beau's trained face that the Duke
leaned toward him; anxiously. j '

Mr. Buntison, .who- had. been', liercely

sen' to him and â¢ tell him ev'ry

"I was speaking to messieurs about
my cousin, who will meddle in the
affair' or his relative". Well, that gen
tleman, he make a marriage for me
with a good and accomplish' lady, very
noble and very beautiful â and amia
ble." (The young Count at his elboÂ»v
started slightly at this, but immediately
appeared to wrap himself In a mantle
of solemn thought.) "Unfortunately,
â¢when my cousin arrange* so, I was a
dolt, a little blockhead; I swear to
marry for myself and when I please, or
never if I like. That lady is all things
charming and gentle,, and, in truth, she
is,â very much attach' to me â why
should I not say it? I am so proud of
it.- She Is -very faithful and forgiving
and sweet; she would be the same. I
think, if I â were even â a lackey. But
I? I was a 'dolt, a little uasensible
brute; I did not value such thing' then;
I was too yo'ng. las* June. So 1 say to
my cousin, 'No. I make my own choos
ing!" 'Little fool,* he answer, "she la
the one for, you. Am I not wiser than
you?* And, he was very angry, and, as
he has" influence in France, word come*

afraid of when he is angry, even In
England, and I mus* not get my Mlre
poix in trouble. I mus* not be discover*
till my cousin is ready to laugh about
it all and make it a joke. And there
may be spies; so I change my name
again, and come to Bath to amuse my
retreat with a little gamingâ l am al
ways fond of that. But three day' ago
M. le aiarquis send me a courier to say
that my brother, who know where I
had run away, is come from France to
say that my cousin is appease'; he
need me for his little theater, the play
cannot go on. I do not need to espouse

"There is one more thing to say, that
is all. I have said to- learn] a secret,

me of that promise, My f rien's, I had

The young man's manner suddenly
changed. . He became haughty, menac
ing. He stretched out his arm. and
pointed at .Winterset. "Now I am no
'Beauqrtfre.'* messieurs. T am a French
gentleman." "The man who Introduce*
me at the price of his honor and then
betray* me to redeem it, is that coward,
that card-cheat .there!**
Winter set "made a horrible effort to
laugh. The gentlemen who surrounded
him fell away as from pestilence.. "A
French gentleman!" he sneered savage
ly, and yet fearfully. "I don't know
who you arc. Hide . behind as many
toys and ribbons as you like; I'll know
the name of the man who dares bring
such a charge!"
"Sir!" cried de Mlrepoix sharply, ad
vancing a step toward him: _ .but 'J^gj.
checked himself at once. He made a
low bow of state, first to the young
Frenchman, then to Lady Mary and the
company. "Permit me. Lady Mary and
gentlemen,'* he said, "to assume .the
honor of presenting to you his High
ness. Prince Louis-Philippe de Valois,
Duke of Orleans, Duke of Chartres,

Christian Majesty, Louis the XV. King

"Those are a few of my brother's
names," whispered Henri of Beaujolaia
to Molyneu'x. "Old Mirepoix has the
long breath, but it take" a strong man
two day' to say all of them.* I can sup
pose this Winterset know* now who
bring the charge!"
"Castle Nowhere!" gasped Beau Nash,
falling back upon the burly prop of
Mr. Bantison's shoulder. ,
"The Duke of , Orleans will receive a

Winterset, as he made his way to" the
door. ,Hi 3 face was black with rage"
and shame.
"I tol' you that I would not soil my
hand- with you," answered the young
man. "If you send a message no gen
tleman will bring ie Whoever shall
bear it will receive a little beating
from Francois."
He stepped to Lady Mary's side. Her
head was bent low, her face averted.
She seemed to breathe 'with difficulty,

g-r^HAT is not just the way the poet
J wrote it, but it is the way it sang
J itself to me as I stood in a hat
I store and looked at hats, hats, hats,
of all sizes, kinds and colors, and
all for menâ not a single woman's" bonnet
among the lot.
I never dreamed there could be so many
different ports, and evtry variety as pro
nounced as ir it had chenille crown,
cogue feather, ostrich plume, chiffon roll
or any other purely, feminine detail to
<lining\iish it from its fpllows.
And as I looked, I marveled afresh that
. any man fchould have the courage or the
â¢ carelessness to appear in an unbecoming
chapeau. Dealers Bay they can tell at a
glance the style of hat a man should
wear so it must be that they are not firm
enough in urging their patrons to let
them do the selecting.
There is some good reason for all the
badly selected, badly worn hats we see on
the street, and every man Ehould go into
executive session with himself to deter
mine that in so far as his influence goes
it shall be exerted toward a needed re
form.
CHIMMIE FADDEN LEARNS ABOUT BOYS FROM EMMET

(Copyright, < 1903. by Edwards >V*. I^wn*Â«ad.}What to Do on the One
Night When You May
Peep Into the â
READERS (and lovers) of
delightful Leslie Gold
thwaite will recollect that
her All-Halloween party â
a model of its kind â was held in an
old-fashioned New England kitchen.
A New Jersey suburbanite achieved
a brilliant social success last year
by celebrating the ever-popular holi
day ir. a new and spacious barn.
Th<* revelers wore the rural cos
tumes of 100 years ago â the women
:-hort gowns, which we name now
"dressing sacques," of "gay calico
belted over brief skirts of the same
material. Their hair, drawn back
over high cushions, was covered by
coquettish caps with floating rib
bons. Men who could not borrow
, f rom country attics short-waistcd
coals end long-waisted waistcoats,
with knee breeches, improvised ha
biliments that lent fun and variety
to the frolic. All the devices for
forcing Dame Fortune's hand, de
scribed herewith, were practiced.
There was a jolly ''candy-pull," and
for a wind-up an Old Virginia reel,
in which â as a last century poet
' wrote of a Christmas "Sir Roger de
<>overly*' (the English dance which
American descendants have re-chris
' tcned under the name of our oldest
English colony) :
"From sixteen up to sixty.
All were dancing on the floor."
J^ince a majority of our readers
must high vainly for farmstead
kitchen and big new barn, let us
accommodate ourselves good-humor
edly to circumstance, yet retain the
spirit of. the time-honored festival.
Apart from traditions of our for
bears' manner of observing Hallow
een that make simple wardrobes
appropriate for the merry-making,
the character of the diversions in
dulged in forbids flimsy draperies,
delicate colors and expensive fabrics.
A tine chance is offered here for the
display of jaunty aprons and short
sleeved blouses that allow free play
to rounded arms and well-turned
vrists in manipulating candy ropes
and snatching at snap-dragon
"sweeties." She is a dull-witted host
ess who cannot suggest a degree of
uniformity in costume that will give
piquancy and picturesqueness to the
scene.
Refreshments should be archaic
and simple. Our clever suburhanit ;
actually broached a barrel of cider â
home-made and pure â and served it
(in old mugs. Doughnuts, crullers.
*'olecooks" and "cheese went around
with it. There were brown bread
sandwiches, plum cake, coffee and
tiny chicken pics, nuts and raisins.
Xo salads, no oysters and no ices,
and all present voted the bold ex
clusion of these conventional "must
bes?' of the modern "function" a
pleasing novelty. They would have
been incongruous with costumes,
place and occasion.
All-Halloween Diversions.
"Bobbing" for Apples.
If this is done in the drawing
room, lay a square of oilcloth or a
thick rug turned wrongside out un
der the large tub which is brought
in and filled within' four inche3 of
the top with water. A dozen or more
apples, with strong stems, are laid
on the surface. The sport is con
fined to the young men of the party.
Each gives to an apple the name of
something he would like to have or
accomplish, be it sweetheart, hon
ors or wealth. , A towel covers his
shirt front and collar, and, kneeling
down, he tries to get up the apple
with his teeth. Three trials are al
lowed to each diver.
Fairy Boats.
Halve English walnuts and clean
out each side neatly. Melt enough
white wax to fill as many shells as
there will be persons present at your
party, and stir in a few drops of per
fume. Have ready short lengths of
coarse c&tton cord, loosely twisted.
Hold a bit upright in the middle of
each half shell, and pour in enough
melted wax to fill it. It will harden
quickly.
Lanprn the spice lamp 3 in a tub
of water, and light the wicks, nam
ing each for a guest, or letting him
do it for himself.- To set them in
motion jar the tub lightly.
If two boats approach one an
other, touch and continue the voy
age in company, the owners' lots
will some time become one and the
same. If one sputters and soon goes
out, the owner will have a brief,
troubled career, v /'
If two jostle and ' interfere with
each other, those whose names they
bear will quarrel.
Should a boat, refuse to quit the
wharf or return when pushed* out,
its namesake is indolent and lacking
in enterprise.
Those that burn longest, predict
length of days.
Cabbage Stalks.
These are pulled from the garden
by the young people in the dark, or
if there is a moon, with closed eyes.
Each must honestly bring to the
light that which he or she first lays
hold of. If much earth clings to
the roots, the holder will have
wealth; if it is bare, poverty. A*
healthy, well-made stalk promises a
handsome partner for life., and vice
versa. A bit cut from the top of
the stalk indicates tJba â¢ temper of

said partner. Some are sweet, some
sour and a few bitter.
When cabbage stalks cannot be
taken from the earth,' order them
from a market gardener. They must
then be put into a bag- and drawn
out, one at a time, haphazard by the
girls, with no > masculine eye-wit
nesses. Each fair ownjr, after in
specting and tasting lurs, cuts her
initials on the stalk, and all are
laid on a table with it cloth cast
lightly over them. The young men
are now admitted, and draw in their
turn without uncovering the row.
If a dance is to come off in the
evening, each yournr men dances the
first set with the girl whose stalk he
haa drawn. The Christian name of
each girl's husband will be the same
as that of him who g(Â»ts the ctalk
marked by her.

. A NEW BEGINNER OMI tsburg. Pa.).
I do not quite comprehend whether
you want a recipe for making as well
as for baking, or it your desire is to
know how to keep the biscuits from
hardening while in the oven. To' make
sure of your wishes, 1 insert a recipe
for quick biscuits in the culinary col
umn. To prevent hardening:, cover â¢ the
biscuits with thick paper (never printed
paper) until live minutes before taking
out of the oven. Then remove the pa
per; set the pan upon the upper grat
ing of the oven to brown quickly and
delicately.
. An exceeding loud and bitter cry from
returned tourists and country boarders,
who find the city quarters they left
clean, swept and garnished, now over
run with insect squatters, moves me to
publish a formula sent in. by a valued
and Big Brother correspondent. One
sample of the above mentioned outcry
may serve as my apology to the unbit
ten who object to the reiteration of this
topic:'
The "B. B.'sV feasted royally on me last

Hints on Boiling.
- Boiled meats (er.cf-pt for coup and boiled
. ham) should be plunged into boiling water
to tear the outside and keep tHe Juices In.'
After it. begins to boll, it. should cook' viÂ»ry
gently for several hours. Five hours Is none;*
too long;for a large pfece; of corned: beef: â¢\u25a0
three hours fcr stewed beef or old fowl; fromr
three to â¢ four \u25a0 hours : for ; stewed \u25a0 (su-callud)
lamb; from four to ' five hours tor on old
wife will be sweet-fempered. These
rules hold good with "women, with,
of course, a change in the sex of the
"partners for life.

Beds and Their Makingâ A
Talk on the Practical .
Issue of Health and
Comfort
Mary E. Carter
Couyright. 1303. by A. S. Barnes &. Co.
ABLE-BODIED ones, old and young,
rich and poor alike, should be
taught to open their own beds in
the morning. Those who do not do it
immediately upon rising, or. else see to
it that it is done by a, trustworthy per
son can never be sure of sleeping in a
well-aired bed. Stripping one's own bed
is the absolutely safe plan, for that
ma- c*Â» neglect of airing out of the ques
tion for the one whu puts the room in
order, Xo matter how many servants
the*-- may be employed in a house, it is
imuossible to tell when negligence in
this particular may occur, 'lhe easiest
way is to make a habit of personally at
tending to this trifling, but by no means
unimportant, job.
\ couple of chairs placed facie- Â»?at
to* seat, a little space between then:, be
fore a window, will hold the bedclothes.
They should be laid over the chairs in
the order in which they are removed
from the bed. This brings the under
sheet uppermost, as it should oe, be
cause it requires the most airing, and
then. too. they will all be ready in just
the order required for making up the
Blankets require special care, and
should never be allowed to touch -the
floor for a second. No one willingly
sleeps under soiled blankets ; they are
not easy to clean at home, and sending
them out to the cleaners is expensive;
further, they lose some of their softness
and beauty with every cleaning. It is
unpardonable to drag blankets across a
floor however clean it may be. When
they hang over chairs, the corners
should escape the floor by two inches.
Observe a new housemaid when she
strips a bed. if you would know how
and in what sort of a house she has
been trained. Thl3 to one of the un
mistakable signs which reveal whether
she has lived with and been taught by a
dainty or a slovenly housewife. But if
she comes from an average boarding
house, you wili know beforehand Just
what to expect.
IN A BOARDING HOTTSE
After the bedclothes have been re
moved the mattress ought to be turned
down over the foot of the bed. By thus
opening a bed before going to the bath
room, and then, after getting dressed,
opening, the window, top and bottom,
before leaving the room, one may rest
tranquilly assured that, whoever makes
up the bed, its ventilation Is a foregone
conclusion.
Once upon a time. not. many years
ago. in a very nice boarding house sit
uated in one of the best portions of New
York I spent some months, and saw and
learned the ways of those places. Nor
was' that the only boarding house ex
perience that my malifle stars destined
.me to encounter. Those same unlucky
led me to dwell from time to time
"in several boarding houses in city and
country. Although they were all con
sidered of the better type. I sometimes
wondered if mine were the only bed and
bed chamber regularly airedâ such sights
and negligence as were patent to one
going to and -fro in those houses! It
seemed to me that scarcely any one
thought of oY knew anything about hav
ing fresh air daily in bed chambers.
One day as I passed an open door I
noticed the bed had been occupied by a
sleeper who. upon leaving it, left Just
the necessary opening where she had
got out. That and the dent on the
pillow were the only disturbed carts of
the bed. The young woman who had
the room had gone out. She knew lit
tle, and cared less, about what was done
in her room during her absence so long
as she found it in order upon her return.
I was not five minutes doing my errand.
When I passed the room again the bed
was all in order, made! Doubtless the
servant attending there knew how to
avoid work, apparently useless <?), cer
tainly not imperative, and had learned
the secret of decreasing the burden of
duties belonging to that floorâ was, in
short, an adept at labor saving.
A DISORDERLY HABIT
A young widow who was the sleeping
beauty of that room used to come to the
table beautifully appareled, but I never
saw her after that memorable day with
out seeing also. In vision, her bed. which
probably never got fully opened except
when it was the day for clean linen â
once a week! Several years have passed
since that time. The pretty widow mar
ried again and went to housekeeping!
Fancy what a housewife she must make!
Those who go about much or \u25a0 little in
hotels and boarding houses need not be
surprised should they discover like prac
tices if they trustfully leave everything
pertaining to : ventilation to much hur
ried and, too often, overworked servants.
The latter persons are not to be blamed.
The blame lies upon those who, having
had greater advantages, ought to look
after these things themselves. \u25a0
A lady well known to the writer used
to place a pin in the binding of her
mattress,' every morning, at the head in
a particular spot. \u25a0 The : next day when
.she turned her mattress over the foot
board she looked for the pin. If it was
still at the head, she knew that the maid
had neglected to turn the mattress en
tirely, and she would ask her why she
had omitted it. She trained several
housemaids, and it never took long to
get them into the habit of reversing tha
mattress unremittingly.
They never knew how she knew, but
they realized that skipping would not
answer in 1 that room. Â»
Sitting down upon a bed after it is
nicely made up is a disorderly habit to
which some are prone even if chairs are
plenty. It is impossible to keep a tidy
looking room where it is allowed. This
Is not the only . objection to that habit:
there are several, among them the soil
ing of the spread, and destroying the
freshness of the bed for the one who
occupies it at night; it is also unman
nerly."

Cynthia Westover Alden
Copyright, 1365. by A. S. Barnes & Co.
NOBODY has ever analyzed what
goes to make a man or woman a
successful seller of goods. Some
t . men and women have the facul
ty, others have It not. Any one can sell
a particular thing to one who has come
to the store to get that thing. But the
riagiclan of the counter takes us out of
ourselves, makes us forget that we have
no immediate use for a dress pattern, or
a lace handkerchief, or a bolt of rib
bon; smothers our senses in deft appre
ciationâand we buy in spite of ; our
selves.
Must Tell the Truth
The magician knows and feels more
about his or her f-Ã¼bject than we do. She
or he warms us with proxy enthusiasm.
In yielding we are not swindled; for no
really great store in these one-price
days lets anybody . lie about the goods
cold. We are hypnotizedâ that is all.
Now, if you have this faculty, you will
cot remain long on so low a salary as
115; and how high an Income you can
make will depend on your energy more
than anything else. But, granting that
you are without it, or have it In only a
email decree, there Is still promotion in
store for faithful work.
For example, there Is the position of
head of stock. That is really head of
department, so far as selling goes. It
pays from J9 to Jl5 a week. It involves
responsibility for all matters of detail in
the arrangement of stock in the depart
ment, and demand* knowledge of every
article Boldâ its cost and price.
Here, for the first time, you have a
power of discretion In dealing with cus
tomers. You may sign for articles re
turned, determining, first, that they are
in good condition, and your credit Blip
Is honored. If you refuse to accept the
return of anything, you must be sure of
your ground, for an appeal is- almost

THE CELLAR-A MUCH ABUSED APARTAMENT
THERE are rules and regulations
a-many for the proper manage
ment of household affairs; but
the cellar, in accordance with the
mlsetjlaneous collection It contains,
p eems to be relegated to the. farthest
corner of the housewife's consideration.
It ia first cousin to the. attic though it
suffers. under f ar more adverse circum
etancts; the attic Is at least light and
airy, even If it Is cobwebby. .. . :
Many housewives don't seem to realize
the importance of keeping the cellar in
&pple-pie ord*r. In more homes than
one would imagine the cellars are in a
condition that the owners would not
care to acknowledge, or if they would
their attitude is so serenely: indifferent
that one is moved to question their re
finement and intelligence.

weeÂ»c She stands for the buyer in
that official's long and necessary ab
sences. In all fixlnj: of prices the buy
er's word or the assistant buyer's word
is supreme. This is vital to the store's
prosperity. Prices often have to be fix
ed while the buyer is away. Track must
be kept continuously of goods that have
deteriorated and ought to be marked
lower, and of staple goods on ' v/hjeh
quotations have gone up, and which,
therefore, ought not to be sold so low
as at present . marked. \ Every day the
buy*r or the. assistant buyer will send to
the advertising manager a memorandum
of what . ought* to be advertised In his
or her department. This, too, is vital.
It demands a clear head, judgment as
to what the public wants, and quick de
cision as to a possible drive or. special
bargain, at cost or a little below. .
The Prize Position
The advertising manager will not take
all the assistant buyer's suggestions,
but he will take some of them. And
from the mass of suggestions he gets
will come the page advertisement that
will call thousands jh ' thousands of
women to the store next day.

they gave their brains a little vigorous

would soon decide that 'such- and such

Buns Like Clockwork
Some stores have women at the com
plaint desks, but not many. Women
customers prefer to complain: to a man.

simply . because the cogs and , .wheels

in good condition. , .â¢
; . Probably I have not given too much
space to thes^e great stores. But it would
not be just to . ignore the fact that in
villages all over the country, women are
found in stores, making from $5 to $20 a
week, and doing as good work as. men.
There Is no way of getting an estimate
of the number of women in " these small
stores, but the chances are, that" if you
could get them all together they- would
outnumber the department store people

Is almost "Invariably a purely feminine
festivity, the masculine mind "being
supposed '\u25a0 to vbe \u25a0' too greatly engrossed
by business in the daytime to pay heed
to anything so frivolous. But the great
popularity ['â¢ ot. this form ; of hospitality
among fair Americans shows thatthey
consider such ' a "hen party"/ as delight
ful to the average woman as a" "stag.
dinner is to a man.

The invitations should be sent "out
from a week â¢to two weeks in advance,
and almost always take the" form of

used.' : ..." -
It is a gTeat mistake to have too elab
orate a menuâ four or five courses are
all ' that are necessary^though at a big
luncheon f there \ are generally at least
six or" seven courses. For the first
course it is â¢fashionable to . serve 'half \u25a0 a

which must be dainty and light, as
heavy sweets and hot puddings are out
of place at a luncheon. Ice cream, cafe
parfait, charlotte russe, wine Jelly with
whipped cream, or something' of the
same sort >is the usual thing, . then bon
bons or delicious, home-made candles are
passed, and last -of all Â» comes black
coffee, although a"; fruit course may pre
cede this, : "if:. desired. The coffee can
either be] served at the table or in the
drawing room afterward, but' the first
mode is the more general at a luncheon.
Wine is sometimes ., served or claret
punch, but champagne should not ap
pear, as this' -is emphatically a dinner
beverage." At small luncheons of but
six or eight covers, -chocolate or tea Is
served with the meat or poultry course,
arid the \u25a0 black ''coffee is dispensed with.
A delightful lltHe luncheon for a woman
to' give to a few friends would be: Clam
consomme with i whipped cream.' broiled
chicken, -tomato jelly - salad, macaroon
russe made' by lining. "a charlotte mould
with -stale macaroons that have been
soaked slightly in sherry "and then filling
H with a charlotte russe mixture through
which is- stirred a good sprinkling of
macaroon crumbs, made by rolling them
like ordinary , cracker crumbs. .* Halted
almonds or peanuts are passed â¢ during
the : meal, and .chocolate ,or ;tea can be
served with the chicken; and left on the
table throughout; the luncheon. -
The Polished Table.
It'ls a little the most fashionable to
serve luncheon on a polished table, with
a dainty centrepiece and, doilies under
each "platen : But if -the \u25a0 table top is not
handsome enough ; for.; this, or has seen
such hard .usage that at' is no. longer

LONDON, Nov. 4. â Striking proof of
the faith of the English royal family
In the superiority of the American mo
tor car driver is afforded by the ap
pointment of an American chauffeur
to accompany the Prince and Princess
of Wales on their* Indian tour. His
name is Harry S. Schuyler and he is a
Philadelphlan by birth. He mastered
the mechanical details of his profes
sion at Pittsburg and put the finish
ing touches to his proficiency at Paris
and Berlin. He was the chauffeur of
Consuelo, Duchess of Manchester, dur
ing her recent visit to America. She
recommended him to the Prince of
Wales, and when it was found that
Stanton. the American chauffeur of the
King, also vouched for him, he was
promptly engaged. Schuyler will have
the distinction of being the first motor
driver to accompany a member of the
royal family to India. It . was an
American, J. Phipps, who, with his
bride, first crossed India in a motor
car two years ago a.nd. made known
to the motoring world how well adapt
ed to the automobile are its superb
trunk roads. Since then . "moting"
has become a. popular pastime in India
The Prince's car is being fitted out
in Paris under the supervision of his
new. driver. It is modeled on one
â¢owned by the Kaiser and is of the
most luxurious character, in order to
properly Impress the native Princes. It
will cost a pile of money, but that
won't come out of the Prince's pocket.
The nation will pay the bill as part of
the cost of cultivating a spirit of loy
alty in India.
TURKISH PASHA WHO LOVES
ACTRESS HUMILIATES RIVAL
Haa Snbjerts Beatrn With ThOMgÂ«
When They Jerr Substitute
Tenor la Play.
CONST ANTINOPLE, . Nov. 4.â Among
the few theaters which eater to the
amusement of . the foreign colonies in
the Turkish capital is the Theatre dcs
Petits Champs, where, during the sea
son, French and Italian companies give
operatic performances. This playhouse
Is under the direct supervision of Red
van Pasha, the Prefect of Stamboul,
who fell madly in love with the leading
woman of a French operatic company.
He suspected that the fair actress was
not Indifferent to M. Labany, the hand
some first tenor. Redvan Pasha was
not a man to tolerate a. rival, so he or
dered M. Labany to be succeeded by M.
DeperÂ«\ a singer of fewer physical at
tractions.
The younger members of the French
colony had. however, learned of. the af
fair, and attended the performance in
force one evening this week to show
their discontent. Before the curtain
rose a noisy contingent started shuf
fling with their fed, cries of "Down
with the management:" being distinct
ly heard. The appearance af,M. Depere
on the stasre was the signal for an ear
splitting din. But Redvan Pasha was
prepared for all eventualities. A num
ber of rough men, armed with leather
thongs, had been distributed by his or
ders among the audience, and they im
mediately grot to work.- An indescriba
ble scene followed, the Innocent suffer
ing with the guilty. Many persons were
badly hurt by. the thongs, and several
of the young demonstrators were
marched off to prison, only to be re
leased the next day through the inter
vention of the French Consul.

CHURCHILLS'
ARE AGAIN
RECONCILED
Winston Goes Mo
toring With Ti
tled Cousin.
Political and Society
Circles Are Greatly
Perplexed.
Duchess of Maryborough Will
Soon Itegin to Beautify
' Blenheim.
Special Cable to The Call
LONDON, Nov. 4. â People in political
and society circles are wondering who
or what brought about the reconcilia
tion between Winston Churchill . and
his cousin, the Duke of Marlborough.
Their estrangement was generally sup
posed to be due to the divergence In
their political opinions. Winston.
Churchill has inherited the brains of
the family and the Duke the money, to
which has been added his wife's share
of the Vanderbilt millions. The Duke
used to make Winston an allowance.
And apparently there was an' expecta
tion that in return ; for his. money the
Duke â or' at least his partyâ was to
get the benefit ' of ' Winston's brains.
But when Chamberlain launched his
fiscal policy "Winston kicked over the
party traces and joined' the Liberals, j
Then it-was suggested to the Duke
by the feminine adherents of his house
that he should- stop. Winston's, allow
ance. His mother. Lady Randolph
Churchill (as She will always. be best
known ) heard of. the talk \u25a0 that was go
nig on. made some sarcastic- comment
on the relative value of her son's
"think box" and iue Duke's^ and ad
vised Winston to decline any further
assistance ~ from him. The advice
chimed in well with Winston'sown in
clinations- and' the ; breach was com
plete. Nftw they have astonished
everybody by going off on a motor tour
together-^-the Duke, of course,, supply
ing the- motor. It is said that Win
ston discovered the Duke had: In his
possession sundry letters and papers
which he (Winston) greatly needed for
the life he is writing of .his â¢ father,
Lord Randolph Churchill. That led to
a meeting between them." The docu
ments "were promptly and cordially
placed at his disposal. Tne two men
shook hands, agreed to -let politics go
hang and took a holiday together.
When the Duchess of- Marlborough re
turns from America she will turn her at
tention to carrying out her plans for
beautifying Blenheim. . They include a
magnificent landscape garden, many,
acres in extent, with an artificial river,'
spanned by rustic bridges, meandering
through it. When nature has had time
to supplement art, it Is expected that the
garden will rank with the best in Eng
land. During the late Duke's occupancy
of Blenheim the grounds were woefully
neglected, for- the Duke, as everybody
knows, wasted his .substance in .riotous
living and mortgaged everything he could
lay his hands on. " His second wife, the
â¢rich American widow, Mrs. Hammersley,
might have restored them had she'chos
en, but she was not so completely dazzled
by a ducal title as to lose her business
head. Foreseeing that her tenure as mis
tress of Blenheim was likely; to be short,
nhe. declined to' lavish her. money on the
place. One of th*Â». sights- of Blenheim is
the American bower, which the present
Duke arranged shortly after his . mar
riage. It is an umbrageous arcade, near
ly a quarter of a. mile long, arched v/lth
trellis work, Â»which Is overgrown with
roses and honeysuckle. At intervals are
placed rustic seats arid tables', at which,
during the summer, tea Is frequently
served. When the' young' Crown 'Prince
of Germany was a gucstat Blenheim lie
was so captivated by the 'American, bower
that he persuaded his father to create a
similar one in the gardens of the Imperial
Palaceat Potsdamv' ; . '-\u25a0 ; >_'-'â¢ I';'.'

PARIS. Nov. 4.â Prince Ferdinand of
Bulgaria is proving r a thorn in the side
of President Loubet and Premier Rouvier.
They want ' to keep 'their feet clear *of
Balkan complications,^ so, when Prince
Ferdinand announced v his ; coming they
laid out such a" copious programme of.en
tertalnment^as-shoots.^visits,' etc., as to
give him no time to talk c business. :'â¢.
The Prince entered with apparent zest
into the round of gayeties, but. kÂ«cn as a
razor, he soon divined the true^nward
ne6s, of these energetic and unceasing
hospitalities. Whenever he : opened con
versation' about' the: real >\u25a0' object i' of : his
visit Loubet was called away or some one
else Joined tbe party .whose -presence
made high confidence impossible. ""
' When the day came for the parade at
Vincennes Prince- Ferdinand absolutely
refused to go, although the presidential
cortege: was lined up outside the'Elysee."
He 'entered; fully,; Into the spirit; of "the
diplomatic comedy of which he was being
made the victim and by this stroke out
witted his' French .hosts 'and passed ; the
morning with Loubet alone. . , ' ,
; The President, shrewd and wily;; found
all - his^ resources ; taxed to ; the utmost, in
dealing with "Ferdinand,, who. "under la

ceals a most alert," tenacious' and ; saga

WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE.
:. "Of course, I believe In woman's suf
frage â but my views on this are- not
extreme. . I don't say - that ignorant
women who know nothing about any
thing but clothes and chit-chat should
vote. If :1 gave wo,men the privilege of
voting, each woman who voted would
have ' to know certain things. They
â¢would' have to undergo some sort of
cross-examination to show their quali
fications. "Only those who passed suc
cessfully these tests would be given any
privileges. There are plenty of women
quite^. capable of voting right nowâ
r who contribute by work and money
toward 1 the support of free institutions
'â and yet 'who have no say-so what
ever. This ;is not right. Women don't
have a show because the men are afraid
to give it to them. Women are better
workers than men in many of the most
Important situations in life. Men can
goo ff and get drunk and do all sorts
of things which should disqualify them
as citizens, arid yet their votes are
.'counted;; and the hard-working
woman^can't.say a word. Is it right?
"I believe also in. a woman' worker's
wage. If a woman can do 9- man's
work, let her; arid let her have a man's
pay- â let the work.be paid for, no mat
ter .who does It. Why should women

saw that it would be best for these
dock laborer* to leave their squalid,
work, and get employment in y some
country village. Many dockmen are
\u25a0 drafted from the country and they
should go back to it Even halt the
! wages â if they can just subsist at all
in the countryâ is better than working
iin crowded" cities. I am a strong ad
; vocate of the back-to-the-land move
' ment, which should lead to the emanci
pation of the British labor slaves."
, While discussing these subjects, Mrs.
Dickson had walked down thÂ» village
of Sleights to her own home, a cozy
I little cottage, which, from the roadway.
: presented a very unassuming appear
! ance, save that it was distinguished by
\u25a0 a porch, all glazed-in like a conserva
tory.
"I call this place Porch House so that
folks can find it easily," she said, "as
It is the only one in the place that has
a porch." .
. The door of "he house was- conical
in shape, and evidently came from some
church. It was of heavy oak.
"That door, only cost me half-a-crowa
-*â I bought it at a sale," she commented,
as we passed through. "All the glazing
in the porch I did myself. I always
do my own glazing. You will ace that
the lines of the panes do not run ex
actly straightâ it was a hard job to get
myself up through the roof. I'm so
heavy, but I managed it; and it doesn't
leak." \
The roof of this porch was made up
of probably a couple of hundred names
of glass, ail of which Mrs. Dickson had
put in herself. She also put in all the
windows of her house, and was her
own architect. She Is an expert with
the soldering iron, and mends all her
own tinware.
"You just ought to haye seen this
i place when I bought it â ramshackle
1 wouldn't describe it at all. Roof cav
ing in; floor sunk; window frames all
out â In fact, the- local authorities in
tended pulling it down â it was such a
rubbish heap. Well. I took It; had it
jacked up and raised; new flooring put
in; a:il. practically, restored. I found
it a very quaint old place, with. line oak
frame and wooden ceilings. I had the
front faced with stone, and made a
new place out of it.
<\u25a0" "" M l believe in the very latest sanitary
improvements. The Americans are very
clever at heating their nom*s,-ao I have
had American heating appliances put
in. and I hope to have electric lights
before long. There is a stream down
here with a small waterfall, and I am
looking into the question of getting suf
ficient electric light from the water
power to supply the town. The Sleights
villagers think I am a holy terror when
I come out with these proposal*, and I
heard one man telling another In a
whisper that 'That ooman's the worst
deevil outen hell' â but maybe they will
know bettfr some day. H9|
Mrs. Dickson was asked about her
alleged /Tolstoyan proclivities:
' "I have read Tolstoy's life and think
he is a good, man for the Russian peo
ple. In" Russia, the laboring classes are
regarded more as ' donkeys than men. I
doubt if Tolstoy would do much good
In England. If to believe in the simple
life, to wear clothes that I make my
self, and that do not cost me more than
$23 a year (they are not things of
beauty or joys forever, however), to do
a lot of manual "work because you like
to do it. and to develop landed estates
and sell at "small* profits.- is to be a
Tolstoyan, then I suppose lam one. I
believe in open-air work, and plenty
of it.;"l.read a great dealâ whenever t

that -comes to hand. I am thoroughly

ECHOES FROM THE
LODGE ROOM
Le. Vespero, the first and only parlor of
Native Daughters of this city that has
undertaken to furnis-h entertainment for
the inmates of the Almshouso, on the
. last Saturday in October paid a visit to
that institution under escort of the drum
corps and members ot Sequoia Parlor of
the Native Sons. One of the instructions
to the Native Daughter? is that they shall
i revere the pioneers of the State. The
Vespero girls, aware of the fact that
there are among the unfortunates in the
city's institute some of the pioneers, who.
once in affluent circumstances, have by
reverse of fortune been obligeJ to seek a
home there. *hich has come to many old
Californians. concluded last year to de
vote a day to cheering these old folks,
and so well pleased were the city'p guests
with the visit and entertainment that the
girls decided to have a repetition of the
day. In addition to a programme of en
tertainment, the Vespero members
brought candy for the women and read
ing matter for the men, as well as to
bacco. The members of the parlor were
amply rewarded for their efforts to please
by the emiles and "God bless yous"' from
the recipients of their bounty. The girls
regretted only that their means and op
â¢ portunities did not permit them to show
' tfieir feeling for the inmates as they
would like to. A pleasing programme
entertained the old folks for an hour and
. A half.
.The following was the order of exer
cises in La Vespero Parlor on the oeca
* Hon of the observance of flag day:
"America." sung by the parlor; the "Flag
Charge," recited by Mrs. E. J. Anderson;
reading. "The Red. White and Blue," by
Miss Rita ODay: "The Star-Spangled
Banner," sung by Miss Ruby Davis; "The
American Flag." a reading by the genial
.and ever pleasant and courteous record
ing secretary. Mrs. Nell R. Boege, and
the singing of "My fcative Land"* by
â¢ * member? of the parlor.
Las Loraas Parlor had a very enjoy
able apron and necktie party in Pendo
Hall, Seventeenth street, on the night of
the first Thursday m November, which
was given under the supervision of a
very attentive committee, of which Miss
M. E. Waters was chairman. The large
\u25a0 number in attendance is proof of the pop
ularity of the social functions that are
given by this parlor.
â¢A very pleasant reception was teaaered
by 'Alta Parlor on the last Thursday in
October to Miss Sadie Kerrison. one of
the charter members, for the excellent
work she did for the parlor at Sacra-
Ttiento on Admission day. This was ar
ranged by the entertainment committee,
composed of Tilly Walker. Sadio Me
\ Nuliy. Gertie Sollman and Julia Marter.
The "reception was in Richmond Hall,
where there was an address by Miss
Walker on behalf of the parlor acknowl
edging the work of the guest, and a re
sponse by Miss Kerrison. Then followei
a. piano solo, by J. Clark; vocal selec
tions. Miss Harney Berkintz; banjo solo,
Robert Kerrison, and songs by Miss A.
Pete, after which there was a supper and
\ dancing. There were present about fifty
gentlemen.
After the last meeting of Buena
Vista Parlor in October the members
entertained the membership of Orinda
Parlor, present by special invitation.
There were present a large number of
the members of the sitting parlor and
of the guest parlor. The host parlor
provided a pleasing programme of
musical and literary numbers, as well
as specialties, after which a delicious
collation was served. This idek of in
viting other parlors to "spend an even
ing with us" is an innovation in local
and if adopted generally would
become very popular. Grand President
Mrs. Stirling will visit Buena Vista
Parlor on the night of November 16.
An energetic committee is planning a
very enjoyable meeting on that night
for the visitors and the members who
shall attend.
The following was the programme of
Las Lomas Parlor on the recent obser
vance of flag day: "America." sung by
the parlor; address by Mary Waters;
patriotic songs, by Agnes Troy, D. D. G.
P.; reading of the "Flag Charge," by
President May Lacy; flag drill, by the
parlor; remarks, by Miss Anna F. Lacy
and Mrs. Slddie P. Daggctt; select read
ing, by Liliie Kern, and the singing of
"The Star-Spangled Banner" by the
members of the parlor.
Within a. few days the order in this
city lost two well-known members by
death, one being Julia Lewis of Fre
mont Parlor and the other Birdie C
Ma'yer, once president of Orinda Par
lor. This makes three deaths of mem
bers of local parlors within three
weeks, the first being Mrs. Lucia Neu
c barth of Buena Vista Parlor, who was
one of the most conscientious workers
for the advancement of the organiza
tion.
Winona Parlor of Arcata celebrated
flag day" by a social evening in Wood
men's Hall in Arcata. It was the fourth
anniversary of the institution of the
parlor. There was a large attendance
and after dancing a banquet was served

Ursula Parlor had an elaborate pro
gramme of patriotic numbers on the
occasion of the celebration of flag day;
ulso an address by Judge R. C. Rust, P.
G. P., in Odd Fellows' Hall in Jackson.
TTeeemite Parlor will give a grand
ball 1 %a the main hall of the Mission
opera building. Mission street, near Sev
enteenth, on November ,l4.
During the latter part of October
Grand Secretary Laura J. Frakes paid
a fraternal visit tqTLa Paloma Parlor
at.Gilroy. The visit was one of Inter
est to all parties concerned and it will
undoubtedly be productive of good re
sults.
The following night the same grand
officer went to Black Diamond In Con
tra Costa County, -where she Instituted
a new patVjr with twenty-five charter
members, 'in the Institution she was
assisted by Sirs. West of La Bandero
Parlor of Re* Bluff, *ho acted as grand

named Stirling in UÂ»nor of the grand
president. After thÂ« installation and

evening ten candidates were initiated.
On the night of the "first Thursday
in- November. Junior Court Pride of
the Golden West gave an entertain
ment to its members, their parents and
their friends in -Lyric Hall. -The at
tendance was very large and the man
ner In which the affair was conducted
showed that the young Foresters are
*">t behind the times in carrying out a
social function. There was a pleasing
programme of music; specialties and a
pleasant quarter of an hour with Billy
Hynes. after which members of the
court presented an amusing sketch.
Dancing for two hours followed the
programme.
The sixteenth anniversary banquet of
Court Washington No. 37, Foresters of
America, in the Lick House on the last
' Thursday in October, was one of the
â¢grandest functions ever given in this
city by an individual court of the or
der. Four hundred and ninety-two
persons* nearly one-half of the number
ladies, occupied seats in the flag-deco
! rated dining-room. For each lady
I there was before her plate a butterfly
\u25a0 hairpin, and before the plate of each
! gentleman was a small silk American
j flag. These were worn as hair and
â¢ lapel decorations during the supper.
I While me courses were being discussed
an orchestra discoursed popular music.
At the outset there was an address of
welcome by Past Chief Ranger

tive." During the evening O. B. Greene
baum. P. C. R.. on behalf of the court
presented to Arthur Figel. the treas
urer, a handsome gold diamond-set
locket in appreciation of his faithful
services. The manner of seating the
people, the service. and as a prominent
newspaper man of this city once .said
"the tout ensemble of the whole" â¢ were
a magnificent success, due in a great
measure to Henry Goldman, the chair
man ,of the committee of arrange
ments, who has been at all times a
very active member of the court, and
who has been honored by being sent
as a representative from this State to
the Supreme Court session held in De
troit. Mich, in 1839; Baltimore, Md.'. in
1901; Providence, R. 1., in 1903, and

Fraternal Brotherhood.
. On the night of the last Friday in Ocr
tober Mission Lodge of the Fraternal
Brotherhood Initiated five strangers into
the mysteries of the order and received
several petitions for membership. Presi
dent Ada Schendel of this lodge, whose
picture is presented in. this issue, has
during the .current term done much to
create a degree of enthusiasm In the mem
bership that has served to keep It well
to the front. The lodge has organized
and uniformed a drill team which has
become almost perfect in the floor work
and the evolutions incident to the intro
duction of candidates. The uniform is one
of the neatest and prettiest that has ever
been adopted by a 'fraternal association.
During the latter part of October Su
preme Vice President Emma R. Neldig
instituted a new lodge in the Mission

Up, up. up the hill the car flew, i
Vaguely I noted on Its crest a huge, ob
servant eye a great, single parsed -win
dow giving toward the bay a scurry of
irr.patipnt purples Jn the twilight.
"A chocolate almond to a caramel that
that is not :he house." I -nasercci with
fate. '"Even if it !s." 1 argued, 'that will j
I -net be the room."
Yet that was the house and that was
the room in which I saw Emma. Eames, !
whom I had ccme to sec. So Is nothing |
too good to be true. They were the emi
nently suitable surroundings and the sing- i
er i\ as frankly luxuriating therein. For
myself, the room hel-i that windowâ made
of poet hands, surely; a blazing log fireâ
half a block away ii seemed; a long line
of noble Keiths; and a huge, cushiony i
couch. Mme. Eames at one end of It. her !
inquisitor at the other. Cordially the im
perial lady had put out her hand as I j
went in and together for a moment we
looked cut upon the city, splendidly pur
pllng upon her hills.
"You can Imagine," she said, as we
made for the couch, '"what all this"â,
window, fire, pictures, of the softly shad
â¢d room, were in the "this," not to speak
â¢ of the attendant friendsâ "what all this
means to me after being cooped up in the
train for so long. Not that I am not as
â¢' comfortable as it is possible to be in my
â¢ traveling. I have my private car, three
servants, bath, all the rest, you know." i
â¢ "Private car, three servants, bath "
"Private car. three servants, bath "
Tee. of course. It is the usual way
for prime donne to travel. Ah! we
are very far away here! Doubtless the
' natural history of the diva is accounted
unknown. Or was it as a child with a
new toy that Eameg so frankly showed
her pleasure here? It i; her first concert
tour. Or wae it a^aln simply as one
more fact about an enormously interest
ing; perÃon, tolfl to one enormously inter*
Â«eted? It was fun to wonder about this ;
afterward. Time there was not then to ;
\u25a0wonder, for Eames is swift and brilliant
of speech. ,
She went on to tell me of her work dur
lr.t the last summer, while I took in the
fvf- flushed beauty of her. â¢
Quite unreasonably I was disappointed.
For me Eames has spelt always a certain
Elsa, a woman of snow and silver and j
\u25a0moonlight, hardly with argent feet to ,
eerth. a goddess of the north, of a temper :
icity radiant as the voice, of her kind per
fect. Not fo the Eames I saw last week.
There were still the cool, chieeled line of
Up and nose, the clear oval of cheek and
chin, the pure arch cf the eyebrows. But (
this was a creature full to. the brim of
the joy cf life. Insolent with life were the ;
Â«?yes. sharply, brilliantly blue. Red with j
life were Up and cheek. Life, vividly, de- '
\u25a0 terminedly enjoyed, was written in every
line of .the royal figure. Where did she :
keep it all when it came to the singing?
But. my grievance. No goddess of the
snows then this, just very woman, and
vain enough to keep on for the other
woman's benefit a love of a hat, olive
' browr like her gown, with a wonderful
\u25a0blue plume that dared with all unsuccess
tfce challenge of the eyes!
What was it she had been studying this
year? "Ballo in Maschera," "Cos! fan
Tutte." and the Requiem Mass of Verdi, j
Did I know that the aria she had sung j
from "Cosi fan Tutte" the night before
was never sung now? Too difficult. One
can hardly even get the cpera. Her ac
companist had had to play his part from
the orchestra score.
Dear ilr. Webber, pianist without sin,
that accounts for something!

me. luxuriously settling into her corner of
- the couch. It was In "Romeo and Juliet,"
\u25a0in Paris. Gounod himself chose her for
the part.
I told her that we had chosen her here
this week for a Desdeinona at the Tivoli.
We have an admirable lago. I told her.
Really admirable. His name? Salassa.
Ah. she had not heard itâ though, of
â¢course, that she had not heard it did not
argue Mr. Salassa unknown.
A peal of laughter preluded this, then
"I sang- Desdemona once in the South,
" with Tamasno and Maurel."
"Ah!"
She continued: "And Tamagno was Â«=o
realistic that when he came to the bed
e'.de to smother me a man shouted: *If
that nigger lays a hand on her*â his
fate vat drowned In the laugh here.
"But why the ' nigger'?" I laughed,
"that was not made In Kentucky."
"I never use slang," Eames put
it, the sensitive nostrils curving slight
ly. "I'm. no precisian, but it does seem
to me that English pure Is so beautiful
that we should be careful to keep it so."
"How much English was asking me
thlÂ«?" I asked.
"Iâ** the Eames eyes blazoned forth an
intimate Drtde as she asked: "Iâ am I
not unmistakably American?"
But afterward she said that, born in
Shanghai, bred in Maine, her ancestry
was English and Scotch, with a dash
of French â not any Irish.
"Or Bernard Shaw, as we say now,"
I laughed.
"Oh, Bernard Shaw," and Eames
put up her hands In protest. "There is
a man I have my own ideas about.
Butâ"
"Oh^yes; go on."
"Do you know he to"â a classic frown
knit the brows.
"Rile*,"''! supplied.
"Irritates me." Eames rebuked.
"H.e riles me." I laughed.
"Sfet his people are all brain peo

can stand them at all. As they are

often foisted upon the art-loving public
"by unscrupulousâ^r to put -it charit

VAnd as to this "charity" phase of art
.patronage, it Is resented by the worthy

' Imrinslc value Just as Jefinlte as does an
other commodity or luxury of life, a truth

that's why he has never made a woman."
*Ml suppose," I dutifully interrupted
; here, "that we ought to be talking
, music."
I "No. why?" Eames asked.
That she did not care to talk of mu
| sic, of her art, of the "holy of holies"
\u25a0 only with those on the same plane of
; development as herself, she told me.
What was there of profit in it? For
I the same reason she never reads criti
] cisms.
"What, never?"
''No. never," she assured me. "I
I do this that I may retain my equili
brium. Imagine two critics, one jaded
yet learned and just, one young, en.

| quite different things to say of my

i would only disturb me, and it is my
i settled rule of life to avoid friction of
all kinds." * ./
"I should have thought . curiosity
would have tempted you here."
j "1 ha"ye no curiosity," Eames said.
"Really!"
"Quite really," the lady laughedâ
! "that Is, the ordinary curiosity. If
j-somelhing interests me tremendously
' I will take the trouble to find out about
i it. But take this: When 1 get letters
that I know are likely to bore me I
put them aside unread for a few days
until I am in the mood to be bored."
, And then I would talk music, even L
One wonders always just what a- singer
herself thinks of her art. The night
before for the rrrst lime I had heard
Eames without the orchestral frame,
without the Inspiration of drama, on a
bleak concert stage. The lower notes
of the voice, to me, had warmed and
deepened; the upper no tee, taken not
i unafraid Â»bmeUmeÃ, lacked sometimes
something of their former secure bril
! iiance. And, almost as unmagnetic as
the woman by me was pulsing with
magnetism, was Eames' singing at that
first concert. One victorious moment
there was in the Browning "God's in
: His Heaven"; it wa3 like that other when
\u25a0 she stood up, . eyes flashing, to say:
| "Power is a splendid thing to have!"
I But of tenderness, sheer humanness,
not a thread.
"Had not the voice deepened since
she was here last?" I asked.
Yes â and gained power In the upper
range, Eames thought. "However high
I sing, the voice Is always the same,"
she said. "With most sopranos you are
generally aware when they take the
upper range. There is a change in the
quality. With my voice you can hardly
tell .when I am singing high notes. I
never prepare for the high notes: one
note comes as easily as another. And
the more I use it the better the voice
gets. Every month it seems better."
"With whom did you learn to sing?"
"Hardly anifjody." the singer said.
"You may say I practically taught my
self. My voice was naturally- placed,
I suppose, and I learned more after my
debut, by listening always, to myself
and others; for the why of this and
that, why this was well, that ill. than I
ever learned before my debut."
A little then we talked of Julian
Story, first painter, then husband of
Mme. Eames. Of his famous portrait of
the singer we spoke; "the best thing
he has ever done." his. wife pridefully
avowed.
"Was it true?" I asked, "that Mr. Story
designed the Eames gowns?" So ran the
tale. â¢ " . . . .-.
"Not one of them," said the lady,
"neither for on the stage nor off." Only
one having seen an Eames gown, each
one an event, can understand of how
much glory Mr. Story was here sudden
ly shorn! She trailed behind her the
golden olive brown of the current crea
tion, as she gave me a farewell hand,
and with a glance backward at the Im
perial figure I came away with this
characteristic statement ringing- in my
ears: "I cannot help doing the things I
must."

The Theater Magazine for November
contains an interesting article by Mil
dred Aldrich, who tells of the American
girls who have achieved fame as singers
in foreign capitals.
Two things constantly amaze the Euro
pean teachersâ the beauty of the female
voice among Americans and the inability
of the average American, no matter how
gifted, to work seriously. American stu
dents think much more about. the mater
ial benefits of success than about the art
itself, even when they are studying, and
perhaps this is a logical result of Ameri
can life and Its scale of values. It Is
not to be wondered at that In a. country
where the great prizes may belong to
great effort, singers should all hope to be
Melbas and Calves, and have ever before
their eyes visions of Pattl and the fabled
wonders of Craig-y-nos- I doubt If there
Is a singer studying in Europe to-day who
does not dream of wearing the shoes of
one the six great stars who are passing,
and remember that only one of them has
made a really surprising- debut, and who,
failing of that ambition, will not. In later
years, be able toexplain just "how it did
not happen," . claiming that, even after
an American girl has wasted time, youth
and money^ acquiring the necessary Eu
ropean "hall-mark." the engaging, like
kissing, "goes by favor.". Forgetting that
a singer's appreciation of a fellow sing
er's art Is rarely -the public's, they will
support this statement, by listing you any
number of singers in the American set
who have had decent careers in Europe
and never been aÃle to set foot on. the op
eratic stage in New York,' either at the
salary. bo fondly dreamed' of, or at no sal
ary at: all. They never take into consid
eration that Americaâ that is the United
States-r-has only two grand opera troupes,
unless you count that at New Orleans,
while every continental city has its opera
house. France has alone no less than ten
outside its two and a half in Paris (the
Theatre Sarah Bernhardt has now a
three months', season of Italian opera).
The opportunities for a debut are, conse
quently, easily a hundred to one In favor
of Europe, not to mention the fact that
while one could hardly feel happy over
the prospect of a debut atâ well, say

Regarding Geraldine Farrar, whom
Mr. Conriea had engaged for the New-
York opera season. Miss Aldrich says:
"Duriag- that same season Geraldlna
Farrar. whom Boston may claim (Mel
rose is so" near by), made her debut at
the Royal Opera; Berlin. Many con
sider her one of the best possibilities
for the future in the American list.
This season she rounds out her five
years .in Berlin and she steps directly
over to New York, "being under special
engagement to Mr. Ccnried. Her flva
years in Berlin have been marked by
much hard work â latterly with Lilli
Lehnsann â some, success, much sensa
tion, plenty of lively and outspoken
opposition to her from singers, jealous
of her success, and much undeserved
notoriety, her name having been used
in connection with that of the Crown'
Prince In most reckless fashion. .Thia
will no doubt prove valuable to her
managers f<rr advertising purposes, but
it belies a simple, ambitious, brave,
hard-working American gir! wht> ought
to have been able to 'arrive* without
it. So great has been her success at
the Berlin Opera-house that the man
agement has allowed her a three years'
pension, which ordinarily accompanies
only twenty years of service. This
showing- of debuts Is by no means a
heavy percentage of those who have
tried for a start here. If one were to
set forth the tales of disappointments,
the heartbreaking stories of those- 'who
have tried and hoped and waited â and

my ears at this moment â it would ap
pall tAcse who have never been in
touch with the struggle. Yet every
failure I have seen has been just as
logical as any of the successes and
exactly as easy of explanation. Some
thing besides a voice is needed for a

and remarkable voices rarely come in
these days!"

dramatic squib published by John C.
Haynes, contains this week the following
interesting: list of plays that have made

LONDON. Nov. 4.â Lord Charles Beres
f ord now appears "as a convinced advocate
of temperance.
"I do not believe alcohol In any form
ever has or ever will do any one any
good," he said.
"I am now 60 years old. and since I have
entirely given up wine, spirits and beer,
I find I can do as much work, or more,
physically and mentally, than when I was
30. I am always well, always cheerful,
always feel fit."

Ie Door smart set!
What it do<*s have to put up with from
the ant-hill philosopher, the social fa
natic and the obscure preacher who needs
the money!
There fat impianied in the human race
an inborn antipathy toward the leisure
classes, the rich or the influential, and
the breaking down of such predjudice
comes' only from education.
Therefore, when a member of the smart
setâ who being in the smart s?t cannot
possibly escape the limelight upon # his
acts â breaks through the convention
alities, a terrible howl goes up about
the corruption of "society," its horri
ble immorality, its setting at defiance
the laws created fo^ the government
of men; when as a matter of sta
tistics â and incidentally as a. matter
of fact â such conduct is inSrUte-ly less
common, proportionately, among so
ciety people than among the body of a
city's population.
And the zeascn' that ihf world hears
such a lot about the drinking and smok
ing and gambling of the smart set is be
cause the numbers are comparatively
few, and the monitors many. Moreover,
because the acts of the few are as
cribed to the many.
It is true that drinkingâ and pome
drinking to excess â go*-s on in society,
particularly among women, who are on
the ragged edge of "nerves" from the
strain of social obligations. It Is like
wise true that a lot of pambHrigâ bridge
.and whistâ goes on in society, but the
â¢disease canr.ot be said to be general. It
is also true that the Ies!Â»Â» r of evils, ciÂ£
Â«rett<Â» smoking, holds some votaries in
the smart pet. but it cannot be said to
be essentially a smart set accomplish
ment.
Some women in the unsocial world drink
because of pressure â not because oÂ» eoc:al
duties, but from loneliness.- monotony and
o\-erwork. Some women in the substrata
of society gambleâ play the rates, and
whist, and five hundred for money. And
they know how to cheat," too. jest as docs
the sister in society, only her stakes may
not be so iarse. â¢
And some women without society's pale
know -how. to smokeâ and dn. But would
it be risrht or just to assert that tr*>se
a!ns WFrc th*' characteristics of the mid
dle and lower, classes?
Then it Is Â«*<iua!ly right and justâ and
equally intelligentâ to aÂ«rib<Â» these vices
to the gmart s*H as an entity. If you
.would attach th* I.**1 .** sins to the ""faFt" pet
of si-ciety that arraignment wouid be
. wholly fair â because it is "fast," and it
â¢doesn't care who knows it.
. But; bo that as? It may, the truth of thp
matter Is that the smart set is neither
. worsfâ nor much betterâ than the rest of
eooiety.
. There are sajnus and sinners "in" and ,
; "out" of the smart s<Â»t. and about equally I
'proportioned. Mrs. Rur-sell Sage and Edi- |
tor Watt^rson to the contrary.

If Ned Greenway hadn't called his
dance a "birthday", dance one would
never have guessed- him: a. year older
than when he gave that great dinner
this time last year."
Just as biithe . and debonair as fresh
man at a college rally, he went about
among; the dancersâ and happy^ little
debutantes â he danced a few steps
with each. And' she was O, So happy!
Right there lies the->amazing success
of . Mr. Greenway's- regime as .social
czar. He is, of all things, tactful.- He
essays to make the quivering, quaking
little debutante at home the moment
she puts the, toe -of her little white
satin slipper on the~ ballroom . floor. And
sllpplnÂ£_her arm through 'his,; he .walks
about with her, and always succeeds in
putting her at ease, ; just ; how I don't
know, unless it's his winning, ways. \u25a0>
Well, these debutantes forthwith put
Mr. Greenway upon j their staffâhence
forth and forever they are, his friends.
After the ball of Friday night who
can. say that San Francisco society Is
provincial? ; V
Never have we seen more stunning

AGENTS FOR. THE GREAT MAJESTIC RANGE. /^P ;
BERNHARDT SAID
TO BE IN NEED
Her Trip to America Under
taken Plainly for Purpose
of Recouping Her Fortune
Special Dlepatch to The Call.
LONDON. Nov. 4.â lt is possible that
readers in the United States may not
know why Sarah Bernhardt's present
lour to Amarica and Cuba has been un
dertaken. They may not be aware that
it is because she is in sore financial
f traits that the greatest actress of our
time has left her beloved Paris and grone
to the other side of the world at the end
of her sixtieth year.
Bemhardt. however, is desperately hard
up. Her experiment of having a theater
of her own in Paris has proved a disas
trous one. how disastrous even her inti
mate friends discovered only recently
when they found out that the rent of the
playhouse had not been paid for over
four years.
It must be confessed, however, that it
is because Bernhardt Is only an indiffer
ent business woman that she finds her
self In tier present situation. It is true
that she has had bad luck, but Fhe has
been recklessly extravagant in staging
ASale of Mahogany Furniture
L. KfCiSS will, during the month of
November, hold a Special Sale, offer-
ing Mahogany Furniture, by Ameri- v
ca's foremost makers, at a great re-
duction so as to avoid handling
and storing during alterations on the
premises. Fabrics and Lace Cur-
tains will also be sold at a discount.

most of her pieces. Her artistic con
science would not be satisfied with "well
enough," and one of her recent Sardou
productions cost in staging and costum-'
ing nearly three quarters Jof a million
francs or 5150,000. Moreover the actress
was generous to those dependent upon
her, and never counted what she gave
them. So her theater is let and Bern
hardt will not be seen in Paris again
until she has succeeded In making money
enough/to pay at least a part of her
heavy liabilities.
Plnero's new play, the first he has writ
ten since "A Wife Without a Smile." is
evidently all finished, for engagements
In connection with it are already -being
made. George Alexander, who has both
English and American rights, will pro
duce the piece at the St. James, when
the part of the heroine will be played by
Irene Vanbrugh, the Sophie Fullgarny of
"Quex." Herbert Waring, one of the
best villains on the stage, who for several
months has been playing in "Leah
Kleschna" with Lena Ashwell, will also
be a member of Alexander's company.
Regarding his new play Pinero is main
taining his accustomed secrecy, and about
all that is known regarding It is that the
scene is laid in a provincial town and
that none of the characters is a member
of the aristocracy.
WRITING XEW PANTOMIME.
As the Drurj' Lane Christmas panto
mimes are now regularly transported to
the United States, Americans will be in
terested in the announcement that the
forthcoming one is being written by Sir
Francis Burnand. It is only the fact
that the veteran editor of "Punch" has
been engaged In other ways for the last
few years, in writing his reminiscences
for example, that makes his present task
seem somewhat Incongruous. Sir Francis
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. , SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 5, -4 1905.-
Burnand began ;writlng burlesque almost
as soon as he had left Eton and is the
author of over a 'hundred iof them, the
most famous being' that 5 of . "'Black Eyed
Susan," which , ran for 800 ; nights . at the
Royalty Theater, ' and was . twice revived
after that. He is an amazingly rapid
writer. His burlesque of "Diplomacy,"
which he called "Diplunacy," was dashed
off inside of five hours. "
He "is an inveterate . and frequently
painful punster, but occasionally says
some really good things. When -an im
postor claimed to be his brother, Sir
Francis wrote to the papers to say that
he had no brother. He said it was true
that he* had two half brothers, but de
clared that In this case two halves did
not make a whole. In writing the Drury
Lane pantomime Sir Francis is haying
the assistance of J. Hickory Wood, who
has invented most of the other Drury
Lane Christmas shows.
After Edna May, the member of the
"Belle of New York" cast," who made
the biggest hit, was easily E. J. Sulli
van, who played "the polite lunatic."
Nothing has been . heard of Sullivan for
some time, 'but now It appears that he
has been occupied in writing the book
of a musical play which he calls "The
Girl From Texas." The score; is being
composed by a musician whose name Mr.
Sullivan will not reveal |at present and
arrangements are now in progress toward
getting the piece produced at a London
theater. The author himself will ap
pear in It, not however as one of the
chief characters, but in the part of an
eccentric little German professor.
LAST WORDS OF, ACTORS.
Evidently Mrs. Henry de la Pasteur Is
to figure largely on the English stage
next year, and perhaps the American
stage, too, although her name is scarcely
known yet In the United States. It Is
just announced thaLshe has arranged to
turn into a" "sentimental comedy" her
latest novel, "The Man From America,"
although it will not be published in book
form for two or three weeks yet. Her
last previous novel, "Peter's Mother,"
which Is now in Its seventh edition here,
was also dramatized by Ihe author and
sold forthwith to the management of the
Adelphi Theater, for production next
spring. She had previously written a lit
tle play for performance by amateurs for
a .fashionable charity. The new story,
"The Man From America," has 'for Its
hero a particularly attractive and ener
getic American youth. .The author has
never been in ; the United States, but
says she wants , very much to go.
The singular appositeness of Sir Henry,
Irving's last spoken words . on ,the ' stage
shortly before his tragically sudden
death, "Into thy hands, O'Lord! : Into
thy hands," has servod to recall several
similar . instances , ; which j are ; recorded in
English theatrical ", annals. , Peterson,' a'
contemporary of Garrlck,, while appearing
in "Measure for. Measure," expired in the
arms of a fellow actor, his last words
being: . "Reason, thus with; life. V lf I do
lose \u25a0 thee,' I . lose a. thing . that none \ but
fools would keep." : Harley," who was
playing Bottom in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," passed away after uttering.: the
drowsy speech, "I, have an exposition 7 of
sleep come lupon me."' * Almost, as. Iry
lng's was Eumund | Kean's exit. He , was
playing " Othello tolthe lago' of his son at
Covent Garden. After uttering the .words,
".'Othello's occupation's /gone," ihe - broke
down. "Get "me off," Charles," he gasped
to his son. "I'm' dying!"rand.soon,after
'ward breathed his last.' PhelpsMast words
before the ; footlights : "Farewell/, a ;
long , farewell ; to? all ; myj greatness." "; At
this point in the speech of .Cardinal Wol
sey, he collapsed and , never acted ; again. '

LONDON, Nov. 4.â Age cannot wither
nor custom stale the infinite carlety of
our inimitable - Labouchere. - His latest
is a defense of corsetsâ stays lie calls
themâ the denunciation of them by the
Congress of. y- Progressive German
Women giving him the opportunity.
"There is," he says, "a; great deal of
futile nonsense talked aooiit stays. I
believe that â¢ stays .are essentially a
hygienic garment. Not only do they
give useful, support to the figure, but
they protect all the vital organs
against cold. - Look at the way women
go about at night with bare chests and
shoulders. Look at the. 'pneumonia
blouse,' has 'ncyer -caused a
sneeze, so far as .1 know. . Look at the
flimsy garments, women , go about in
regardless of weather and. temperature,
and then compare them with what men
wear. Look at the way our grand
mothers dressed ; in their youthâ^from
their- chins to the soles of their feet.
How is it that women can do all of
these things .with" impunity? Because
of their stays.
"I have often thought," he adds, "ot
getting a. pair myselfâ not for the sake
of appearances, but In order to enable
me to dispense with anYovercoat, and
possibly other garments. ;If you had
them ' lined with .flannel, I do not know
that you need wear anything else, ex
cept, of course, for decency and orna
ment. I; believe' the only place where
a man (or woman) really- wants cloth
ing is the small of the back â the place
wher : you.put a horse-cloth when your
animal : Is standing in the rain.' With
a few thicknesses of stuff round that
part ! of , your , anatomy, you can defy
anything but propriety and convention.
Fortified 'by, stays, .some women even
manage to defy them."
A man jis never much nearer heaven
than when he makes a child happy.

KEOUSE^ OUT ON WEIT
Self - Constituted ; Counsel
of First Wife Eeleased
by Order of . Judge Dunne
In : his desperate endeavor to have
the indictment against him for per
jury, quashed or set aside, George D.
Colllns^had an extensive collection of
ancient volumes dragged before Judge
Lennon yesterday. ' . He .attacked thtt
impannelment of the Grand Jury and
also' the competency of the members
to,: vote on the perjury case, when he
maintained, ' they had already formed
ah opinion as^to the essential element,
the bigamy charge.';
Collins argued that as Walter B.
Bundschu, ; one ; of.the Grand Jurors,
was I not | on -' the assessment roll, the
fact that he-was present at the voting
on the indictment invalidated . the ac
tion.- In support of s this Collins intro
duced 'an archaen - decision : in a Texas
case regarding? a -juror -who belonged
to> an anti-rent " paying, -.. society. â¢ This
juror I was, held not-; competent to act

grasped at was the fact that four; or

Indignant at Mrs. Mackay.
LONDON," Nov. 4.â Much. indignation i 9
felt In Roman Catholic circles in Lon
don at an insult which it is alleged Mrs.
Clarence Mackay has offered to members
of that church. It appears that a lady
wrote to Mrs. Mackay asking for a sub
scription toward some philanthropic
movement promoted by : her for the bene
fit of Catholic children. She received a
curt reply â¢ln'which" Mrs. Mackay, pointed
out that she was not a Roman Catholic
and | that she did not approve of the
scheme which the applicant was promot
ing. In view of the fact that the Mackay
family have been brought up strict Cath
olics and that in London Mrs. } Mackay
Sr.'has always been a generous supporter
of Catholic charities, the action of Mrs.
Clarence Mackay Is Btrongly commented
on.

TALK OF BULLET HOLES.
\u2666
ON Friday night the followers of Mayor Schmitz held a meeting
in Saratoga Hall. They were not in an amiable mood. Mr.
Ruef has already suggested that the way to stop newspaper
exposure of graft is to murder the editors, but he did not go so far
as to advise massacre of the preachers who protest against the part
nership between government and vice. This was left to one of his
supporters in the Saratoga Hall meeting, who read the recent re
-marks of Rev. Mr. Patterson on the subject of graft and sin, and said
the proper thing to do would be to "fill Rev. Mr. Patterson's hide so
full of bullet holes that it would not hold corncobs."
This pacific proposition was received' with shouts of approval.
The newspapers have not been intimidated by Mr. Ruef's suggestion
that their editors be murdered, and we do not think that the clergy
men of the city will be awed into silence for fear of being shot full
of holes. These threats are part of a campaign of intimidation. The
Mayor threatens civil war in the streets if he is beaten. Ruef ad-
vises murder to silence the press, and now the pulpit is to be kept
quiet by the same means.
It will be a fine thing, surely, to go out to the world that San
Francisco was cowed by these threats and submitted to two years
more of rule by the gang that made them. It will establish our
reputation as a good place to avoid. If the men who make such
threats are given office by the people it will mean that they will pros
titute official power to the purposes of private vengeance. It will
speak ill for the spirit of the people of San Francisco if they seem
to be overawed and afraid to escape from graft by fear of murder.
W. RANDOLPH IS BUSY.
HON. WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST is not only running
with all his might and main for Mayor in New York, but is
busy with what may be termed concurrent activities. He finds
time to take his pen in hand and write for his paper editorials in
structing the world in biology, anthropology, economics and stirpi
culture. He has not only noted infant mortality and looked on as a
sympathetic observer, but he has gone knee deep into the cause
of the juvenile diseases that cause the mortality. Having found it,
he does not keep it to himself but prints it, lavishing big type upon
its emphasis, and publishes it fearlessly to the world of woe and
undertakers, fathers and mothers.
He finds the cause to be that babies have mouths and hands to
suck with them. Therefore he comes crying the message that
mouths are a mistake in babies. If they were only born without
mouths and cut them in their second summer as they do teeth, not
a baby would succumb. Or having the untimely and unfortunate
mouth, a mere hole in the upper end of the alimentary canal, into
which microbes crawl off their sucked fingers, if babies had no hands
to put in their mouths full of bacilli the navigation of their alimen
tary canals would never be interrupted by storms, and infancy would
be one long bliss.
Given now the mistaken mouth and the intrusive hands, what
is to be done with this little cuss who insists on using the one to
suck the other? A less analytical mind than Hon. William Randolph
Hearst's would have said, "Sew up the baby's mouth, stop that open
door to the entrance of bacilli."' Or. perhaps such an inferior mind
would say handcuff the infant hands between its legs or behind its
back and leave it its mouth for yelling and protest purposes. But
none of this for Hon. William Randolph Hearst.
When he knits his brows upon a great subject something has
to give. He will neither sew up the infant mouth nor plug'it like a
bunghole. He will leave that upper end of the tortuous intestines
open, free and unobstructed. Nor will he handcuff the xrhild between
its legs or otherwise, or*even disinfect its microbe fingers. All such
petty expedients are cast out of. his philosophy. He knows a trick
worth all of them in combination. It must have burst upon him like
a revelation from the high angels, for he bursts it in his paper with
black letter and bull type emphasis, and after it bursts here it is, in
his own few, well chosen words : "When a baby is born put cdtton
gloves on its hands and KEEP them there."
Then he explains that cotton gloves do not taste good and are
not pleasant to suck, and the simplest infant will keep them as far
from its mouth as possible, and will use that reprehensible opening
for the legitimate purpose of mewing and puking. It will be no
longer a microbe trap to convey the germs of colic, cholera infantum.
collywobs and other juvenile distresses and fatalities into the shoals
and quicksands of the child's insides.
It is a pleasure to us, as a matter ol human interest, to give this
life-saving device the benefit of our circulation. The graveyards are
full of dead babies who passed pathetically hence for the lack of
cptton gloves. Worse than this, the busy walks of life are crowded
with adults who are not what they should be, because immediately
upon their birth their infant hands were not cotton shod, and they
clawed up handfuls of microbes and emptied the mess into their
open and flaring mouths.
' We have no doubt that when the Hon. William Randolph
Hearst gets time to follow up his research and his discovery he â¢\u25a0will
connect its philosophy with its psychology, and the next time he-em
ploys bull letter emphasis will impart to a world that sucked its paws
and Ailed its belly with trouble the information that the bad men,
like Cleveland and the late President McKinley, whom he regards
as reprobates, sucked in evil on their lisping tongues from their in
fant hands.
When he exhausts this great subject it is expected that he will
give the world the long delayed answer to the question, "'Why is a
dog's nose cold?" ' v
NECESSITY OF ILLUSTRATION.
PICTURES â everybody loves them; in that way we are "but
children of a larger growth," and the value of pictures to a
successful periodical seems now to have passed from an added
desirability to a positive necessity. The recent death of the famous
English publication, Longman's Magazine, the cause of which is
diagnosed as the lack of illustration, is an evidence' of this neces
sity, and the failure of Longman's to hold a place in the field of
modern competition has precipitated some discussion of the mag
nitude of pictorial power. To the popular magazine of these! days,
and surely the times are not retrogressive, the illustrations are 'as
the breath of life ; they must have them or they pine and die.
Longman's Magazine had long established prestige, fine talent
in its text, and for its contributors writers whose very names should
have spelled conjuring power; but the attraction and adjutant* force
of illustration to make the text appeal to attention and lighten an
all too heavy look not being secured by its editor, even such names
as Kipling, Thomas Hardy and Rkler Haggard could not keep the
periodical alive. That the absence of pictures ruined 'hiÂ». magazine
is the admission of Longman himself. He, however, seems to fail
to recognize that illustration is of real importance outside of the
business necessity consideration, for he talks of the modern com
petition for the favor of "the sixpenny public," and somehow the
expression appears to indicate that he does not realize his failure to
keep the magazine afloat was because of his neglect, not of a foolish
fad, but of a real need of progress in widespread publicationsâ
namely, art progress. Crude to commence, perhaps, but progress;
and, as Huxley says, all things must have thtir humble beginnings.
The value of pictures to reinforce a story, to. make the mind
grasp an idea more quickly and more intensely, to bring out more
of meaning than the text alone could, is undeniable. It aids con
veyance of information with less wearing of the attention, and causes
memory to more distinctly retain it. Â» Whatever force the picture
or the text alone might have, when you aptly put the two" together
the united effect is very far more than merely the double of simple

AUTOMOBIGAMY.
THE most skillful chauffeur in Denver is under arrest for big
amy. Bigamy is a felony, but the law that makes it so was
passed long before automobiles were invented. Times "change
and laws and customs change witlr them. The automobile' .has
proved to be a lady-killer. Every, day somewhere on tlie road a
machine turns turtle with a lady under it, but the tragedy ,does. not
deter others and they go sailing into eternity as gayly as, to a picnic.
Under such circumstances why should not a chauffeur 'have a few
extra wives in stock? â¢ ,
In Utah, under the system. of matrimonial exuberance and,liber
ality followed by President Smith of ''the Mormon churchy this call
be easily arranged and' will make that State the chauffeur's para
dise. elsewhere the rigid and cqld-hearted law., will ..interfere
and prevent the chug wagon drivers having; extra establishments,
so that the summary taking off of one wife need not interfere with
regular meals and washing. .. j-. ;
The attention of Mr/ George Meredith should be called to this
conjugal. reform, and that Kansas legislator who proposed to change
the marriage contract system may study the matter to advantage.
There is no doubt that such a privilege conferred upon chauffeurs
would greatly increase, their number. ; Every garage (would have a
sign reading, "Come early and avoid the rush," and criauffeuring;
would be the most popular occupation of man.

PEARL IN
A TOOTH
J. ASK' you how I could help it?". was
all Alphonse Ducroit's defense when
called on in a Paris court to explain
why \u25a0he had playt*. a new trick on
a poor dentist. "It was so easy; he bit
like a ' pawnbroker." Here is what he
did: ,
The dentist. Hugues Holer, was eating
his lunch when a patient called with, ac
cording â¢to the servant, such a terrible
toothache that human pity could not re
sist. The dentist left his chops and put
the man In a chair.. C'
He found a hard substance in one of
the teeth in the back of the jaw which
looked like a metal rilling ready to come
out. . He touched it lightly with his in^
strument'and the next instant had a good
sized pearl in his hand. f
"Sapristi! but it's a pearl! Who's put
a pearl in your tooth?" .^
Ducrolt, for it was he* explained in a
mystified way that he had indeed been
eating oysters a moment before, and had
thought he had broken a tooth by biting
,on a piece of shell. He at tirst seemed
delighted and discussed with the aston
ished dentist the probable value of the
gem. Then: :_ >
"I am sorry I have no money to pay
you with; I went off in such a hurry that
I did not pick up my pocketbook."
"Oh, that's all right," said the dentist,
!'you can â "
'"Tlens l here's an idea." said Ducroit
suddenly. "You keep the pearl, till 1
come to-morrow, and, for form's -sake,
you might let me have fifty francs as
pledge of fair dealing."
The dentist thought that was all right,
too. He gave Ducroit ' the fifty and put
the pearl- away. Next day, -when the
lucky owner did not come oack, he
thought he would take a look at it. The
microscope showed it a vulgar imitation
that, said the magistrate, ought not to
have taken in a baby.
"It was only the eighth time I'd played
that . trick!" . he declared sorrowfully.
"There should have been 500 francs more
in it. Brains don't bring the reward they
used to, mes enfants!"

He extended boCh hands in passionate
appeal.
"No, Harold," said the fair, proud girl.
"I can never be yours.", *
"Never?" he cried, in anguished tones.
"Never," she answered coidiy.
His hiood changed.
"Oh, very well." he sneered. "There
are others."
"Yes, Harold, I know there are." she
said. "And I accepted one of them this
afternoon."

TOO LAZY
TO SPEAK
TOO lazy to work, or play, or even
speak and ambitious only to spend
the rest of his life In an English
prison.
-This is a fairly exhaustive character
sketch of Gustave Blankmeyer, a foreign
er, 22 years of age. who is proving a baf
fling problem to British poor-law ana
prison officials, and who was charged at
North London recently." with refusing to
do anything in the local workhouse but
eat and sleep, says the London Chronicle.
Given â¢' wood to chop at the workhouse,
he refused, observing that he did not like
work. "I prefer prison," he added, mak
ing a rare exception to his general rule of
restful silence, "and I hope to spend the
rest of my life in an Kngtlsh jail."
It was then suggested that Blankmeyer
should do some scrubbing. He explained
shortly that he did not like scrubbing.
Requested to pick up blocks of wood thai
the other men sawed from logs, he merely
shook his head^ and intimated that '.the
subject was closed.
"I am beginning to think.*" said Mr.
Fordham, the magistrate before whom
Blankmeyer was taken, "that prison is a
most comfortable place, with its freedom
from outside responsibility. It is a pity
I can't send this man back to his own
country. I see he has been thrice in
prison, and is Just released from a period
of ' twelve months' imprisonment as an
idle and disorderly person."
: "He has been kept in idleness in this
country for eighteen years," .. observed
Mr. Tllley, who prosecuted for the guar
dians.,
"Is he right in his mind?" inquired the
'magistrate. \u25a0 : - â¢ ' \u25a0 â¢
Mr. Tilley said that the prisoner had
been lexamined at various times, but no
mental defect Euflicient to warrant his de
tention ip an asylum had been discovered.
One report was that he "suffered from an
intense disinclination to work."
"Will he play?" asked the stipendiary
"No, he has never been known to play,
and he never speaks unles3 he is obliged
to do so,", was '. the reply.
Mr. Fordham 'said the only course open
was to send the prisoner again to the ses
sions as an incorrigible.

utter a single word, and he took no in
terest in the proceedings.
PUBLIC TO BLAME.
That the people themselves are to blame
for bad ! government, is the keynote of
the retorm efforts of Joseph W. Folk,
Governor of Missouri. Some of his perti
nent \u25a0 utterances, from the October Men
and Women, are:
: "If the people want good government
they can have; it. 'but they must want it
with an active desire and they must in
sist upon having It. The indifference of
voters is the greatest menace to a repub
lican form of government."
"Most people are honest, but they are
inactively so. while the vicious majority
are perniciously active. It is not enough
to be merely honest. We need more fight
ers in the army of peace. Aggressive
methods only will stamp out graft and
corruption."
"There are no 'necessary evils* in gov
ernment. It is the abuses of government
about which all good citizens have a
right to complain. If the honest voters
would assert themselves, however, they
could have local and national government
of which they could be proud.",
"Good men will observe even bad laws,
and bad men will break even good laws.
All men. good and bad, should be com
pelled to obey every law. good and bad.
because it is a law. Disregard of one
law breeds disrespect of all law."
"Many persons thrill with patriotic
fervor at the thought of risking their
lives en the battlefield, but they forget to
vote on electiop day. The patriotism of
peace is as necessary as the patriotism of
war. The man who will live every day
for his city and State Is needed more by
the Government than is the man willing
to die for his country."
"The best citizen seldom goes to the
primaries and often fails to vote â two
duties that the bad citizen never neglects.
And when bad men elect bad men to of
fice they support him loyally In the evil
he does. That Is the chief cause of cor
ruption in American municipalities."
"Let him who, without good cause,
avoids his simple duty of casting a bal
lot, be barred by law from all the privi
leges that flow from citizenship.. Men
appreciate something that they are in
danger of losingt
"In a word, we need the honest votes
of honest men. When these unite and
stay united, demanding honesty in the
conduct of public affairs, then graft will
become unknown."

AND SOME OTHER GOOD ONES.
â¢THE MOST SUBLIME DIVINATION
<>ver made by men is the declaration that
God is love." That is the way Hamil
ton Wright Mabie begins the eight
eenth chapter of his new book called
â¢The Great Word." and the essay in It
upon the theme of "Love and Law."
Love is of course the "great word" to
which the book is devoted. Mabie adds:
"Not only have all other explanations
of the universe seemed incredible, but
to reason itself have come great con
firmations of the 'truth of the sublime
divination, as^ through clouds and dark
ness science x has discovered the out
lines of an order â¢ â¢ â¢ passing on
through the passion for self to the pas
sion for others, and predicting the
other great truth that love and law are
spirit and method In a sublime pro
gression of creative energy."
The book is about a gTeat subject,
and to attempt to handle it seriously
\u25a0would be rash audacity in any writer
not of the first rank and winged by
lr-nsr obedience to the "great word" of
which he tells. But we know that
Mabie may. for he has reached three
score years of a life lived so reverent
to high ideals in literature that he cap
tured the technic of its letter and re
ceived the gift of its spirit. Of coun
try Is due him a great debt of word
created love because of the enrichment
his life work gives to American litera
ture. Now that at the mellow age of
â¬0 he adds to that already written al
brary of choice volumes a little book
about the word Jsvhich is the supreme
word in our language â the one that
may be linked by hyphen to God him
self without blasphemy, our gratitude
to this prince of essayists must needs
he overflowing- In bo worshipful a
manner does his art handle his lofty
theme that ail through his pages we
realize his motif of adoration for the
word whereof he bring-s to us his
trained interpretation: and tlTe reader,
beholding the attitude of our author's
spirit toward the word, might well
nitirmur the quotation from Victor
Hugo. "We salute the man who

tion to quote that the difficulty will
be to eliminate from the quantity of
fine sentences the much that would be
too much for my space. I will give
you a tiny bit from each of the beauti
ful chapters, seeking to suggest the
foul of that chapter In the fragment
presented, and so set the mind wander
ing into fair fields of thought.
The first chapur is "The Mystery
I'iay": "They come and go. the men and
v.omen who wear the masks of comedy
or tragedy, whose breath sounds the mu
sic or discord of speech in manifold tones
and words; â¢ â¢ nowhere is the mystery
of the play dispelled, nowhere is its ulti
mate issue revealed. â¢ â¢ The final
bcene is never disclosed, the curtain is
never rums up on the last act."
The second essay is "The Birth of
lajvc": '"Her heart was swept like a
sÂ«.a that is lifted m sui-ges. and the soul
in her seemed to struggle for space and
light and air; for her whole nature was
swept toward blossoming and fruitful
ness."
Chapter 111. "Infinity, Immortality and
Love": "For there is no word for infinity
and immortality in any language, divine
or human, save the word love. â¢ â¢ Amid
the t- Ings that perish it knows itself im
perishable and in a world of limitation it
'knows that it is iill: litable. â¢ â¢ Free to
compass all thngs, to survive all muta
tion, and to escape death by the power
of its immortality."
"The Vision of the Immortal."â "The
artist deals with all manner of crude ma
terials, but he knows what he can evoke
from them, and in every bit tft the mate
riaJ in his hand he discerns the Immortal
potencies of beauty. The lover, who is
the greatest of all artists, is not confused
or blinded by the imperfections which
perfection wears in this world."
"The Great Adventure."â** â¢ * for the
possibilities of the great adventure which
we call life are illimitable. â¢ â¢ The
great adventurer has dreamed no dream
more marvelous than what he calls the
reality of his existence. â¢ â¢ the dream
of love is the divinest reality; â¢ â¢ it is
a sudden flash of the- beauty which lies
in thÂ« heart of life, a touching of the
keys, brief but sufficient to sound the
master motive."
"The Mystery of Personality."â "And
nowhere is mystery, the sense of the
presence of that which transcends our
knowledge, more mysterious than when
we look into one another's faces and call
one another's names. â¢ â¢ Who knows
himself? â¢ â¢ The rose on a woman's
bosom â¢ â¢ is also a symbol of an invis
ible order in the universe, a single preg
nant word of a sentence that cannot be
'spoken, because it lies within the keeping
of the language of infinity and eternity."
"Love and Work." "Men are made
happy by the noble putting forth of the
eoul in love and work^ the two great
activities which are never divorced In
the harmonious and balanced life, the
two languages in which every true Ideal
ist makes confession of his faith and gives
evidence of its reality."
"The Appeal of Love."â â¢ â¢ the
one voice In all these activities that
bas pierced his soul and made him

after God has been the voice of the
master passion. â¢ â¢ For love is

' "The Silences of Love," â "For us, as
for our remotest ancestors, life Is still

when its depths are uncovered we
stand silent In a presence in which
silence is the highest form of prayer.
â¢ *. Therefore It Is. writes Maeter
linck, that such of us as have loved
deeply have learned many secrets."
"Day Unto Day Uttereth Speech." â
"In a vain endeavor to ease that pain
which is part of all great faiths and
passions, love uses a few words over

"The Prophecy of Love." â "Before

"The Expectation of Love."â "Love
gives herself not to that which is
achieved, but to that which is possible.
When others surrender hope she lights
it â¢with fresh sacrifice; when all seems
lost she sits clad with loneliness as
with a garment, but with expectation
still lighting the darkness of the
hour."
"The Highest Service of Love."â
"There is an instinct in the soul of
love which knows that it is Immortal.
â¢ * Love also knows that nothing
is ever really lost in this world except
opportunity. â¢ â¢ He loves me most
who helps me to do and to be the best
and the greatest in any human relation.
â¢ â¢ Send some one, Lord, to help
me so to live that, while I part with
many things by the way, I lose nothing
of the gift of life."

ILL USTRATIONSARE
BEAUTIFUL. *
"Constable," by M. Sturge Hender
son, a new book Imported by Charles
Scribner's Sons, is made ' very beauti
ful by thirty-nine illustrations repre
senting some of the notable works of
the great English painter, of whom the
text of the volume Is a history. The
landscapes of the famous master make
very handsome pictures even In the
| attempted imitation of them in the
soft black and whites and grays of the
book's prints.
John Constable was born in Suffolk
I in 1776 and was the son of a miller.
; The bent of his mind while he was a
young boy showed itself t to be land
scape painting, but his father was op
posed to his adopting art as a profes
sion, and wished him to prepare for the
church. This the lad could not con
sent to try. but he let art alone for a
while, in order to please his father and
learned the milling business. It is for
this reason that windmills are seen in
some of his paintings. Art would have
Its way with him and Constable
struggled for a long time with ob
stacles before he found recognition and
good pay. The most interesting thins
about his private life was his so long:
Laffled but nra'iy triumphantly suc
cessful love for Miss Bicknell. who
herself was willing enough, but . she
obeyed her parents, who were for long
years opposed to the union.
One of the most curious things about
the history of his art Is that, although
he has bad a most powerful influence
ou modern English landscape painting,
that influence was not direct, but came
about in a circuitous way. from France.
Constable's work strongly, impressed
itself upon the art of the. famous
French painter, Corot, of the Barbizon
Fchi 01, and aftsr; Coiot had. perfected
himself as a poetic, painter ; the Eng
lishmen arot their insoiration from him. ,
THE SAN .FRANCISCO GALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER >5, 1905.
It is in this way that Constable be
came the father of English landscape
painting.
A remarkable example of the growth
of Constable's art power is shown in
the two paintings tie made of .jal'.fc
bury Cathedral at different times in his
development. In 1522 he painted the
one called "From the Bishop's Garden,"
in which the great spire of the cathe
dral is seen from a foreground, in which
tall trees form an arch and through
this arch the observer looks upon the
church. It makes a* very pretty pic
ture, but art critics object to Its be
cause of its artifice, which they think
was unbecoming -n so great 1 an artist
as Constable. "The architectureof the
cathedral is adequately and faithfully
rendered, but the arching of the fore
ground trees is altogether beneath the
d pnity of the central con;:ption. I'
has the bad taste of an apology.for the
inherent and inevitable."
Nine years later he painted the
"Salisbury Cathedral From the Mead
ows." It is a much bolder and grander
conception and execution than the one
from the Bishop's garden and is among
the greatest of Constable's creations.
The rainbow of the finished picture
forms completely "the central and uni
fying- idea." â¢ \u2666 â¢ "Th* cross-sur
mounted spire, outreaching the. storm
to a sky that is serene, unites the
cathedral â monument of the toiling
faith of generationsâ with the bow of
the covenant In the heavens." '
An interesting story about this pic
ture Is that when Constable died It was
proposed by his friends that It should
be purchased and presented to the na
tion as a memorial of the great painter.
Irey decided not to ; because they were
afraid the work was too daring to win
pen aral favor. A beautiful but much
tamer picture was selected instead. The
loss to the public that this timidity
caused Is said to be very great.'

MASTERPIECES ARE
INTERPRETED. ,7
A very handsome book Is the thirty
four page "Womanhood in Art," pub
lished by our local . artistic publishers,
Paul Elder & Co. _ It is an interpreta
tion by Phebe Estelle Spalding of half
a dozen of the great masterpieces .. of
sculpture and painting, chosen' as giving
us types of womanhood. A large, beautiful
plate of each of these is given. The
subjects are Eve, Venus de Mllo, Mona
Lisa, Beatrice Cenci, Madonna Jof the
Chair and the Slstine Madonna. -It
has ah Introduction which Is a brief
well-worded' appreciation of the > great
in art, and a charming: explanation of
the purpose which impelled the prepa
ration of the brief book: "It Is with
,â¢ â¢ â¢ a keen appreciation, of% the
service which the genius of ancient and
modern times has rendered, one .woman
of my day that I have studied and
enjoyed some of 1 the world's ' master
pteces. And it Is with the enticing hope
of sharing with' those of kindred tastes
and aims a measure of the stimulus and
satisfaction which this study has | af
forded that I ' have written this : mod

best known Ideal conceptions of woman
in-art."- .', ; ' -- ; ;. Â»- . '.'\u25a0\u25a0' . \u25a0'\u25a0â¢\u25a0;;"
She Interprets the Venus de Mllo
as representing /the loftiest ideal in
women. "Lofty," : she says, "because it
bears no trace of \ weakness or -, blight
or; wrong."" â¢; She sees in it "strength,
beauty, freedomâ these are the' de
mands of normal, healthful life, â¢â¢â¢
and to develop into fullest fruitage, by
communion with their like*, aspirations
of , bravery,', serenity,: goodness Jand
powerâ this ' is j the appeal of the Venus
deMilo to 1 all of .womankind." ,
In Eveâ^it [is I Dargonet's of the Lux
embourgâshe sees the gentlest; of vic
tims, "most innocent enslaver.'.' It is
the grief ; and: repentance : that the art
ist has put into his statue that , makes

preter:* "O% frail, repentant Eve,' r " thy.

of .this' world-: renowned -.' painting*^ upon,
'which ; Da iiyinci; spent r four 3 years': and
then confessed he"could; hot i finish it;
She - admits: that Mona Lisa is J-aXtype
of : "the eternal . feminine,", but ; she does
not \u25a0 translate ; it as t a very:; noble '', oner*
; She â¢ knows â¢ that \u25a0. the devotees ;â¢ of i% the
Mona^ 'Lisa '?\u25a0 cannot I explain : - the" i mys-_
\u25a0 tery,' of her.eveh' to themselves; and' she"
states \u25a0 that V the Mona I Lisa lovers "say
that she has charm, fascination and
authority. She analyzes her elusive
ness down, however, to entrapping sub
tleties, "the most entangling gift of
coquetry." â¢ â¢ â¢ "The mystery of
resistless, treacherous lure?" She puts
her in a class of women "whose beauty,
gifts, or lack of both, are made ef
fective through feminine manipula
tion." And she closes the case. against
her thus: "Hulersare they of' king
doms, large or small; and though other
women with keener brains, perhaps,
and kindlier hearts, with finer tastes
and stronger souls, may despise their
arts and resent their sway, they must
recognize and reckon with their power."
It is the one severo arraignment of the
book; and what will many men â the
lovers of the unbeautiful but fascinat
ing face of Mona Lisa â say to that?
Is it a wise warning to men who love
witchery and mystery in woman? or
dare .we playfully to suspect that it
is just a little unconscious feminine
jealousy of the lavisnment of mascu
line adiriiration upon Mona Lisa? That
there is. allure in Mona Lisa's smiling
face all men -will admit; but as to the
whither of the allureâ whether upward
to love and life and light, or wayward
to love and dark entanglement â each
man must answer separately for him
self.
The author i ises to a culmination of
her enthusiasm when she reaches the
Sistlne Madonna." Any one considering:
that picture must wish for a good in
terpretation of the Intent, almost star
ing look that is ' depicted on the face
of the mother of the Savior. Our author
thus sees with her what Madonna sees:
"To her far gaze has been revealed a
countless throng of human lives of
every age and clime, dark-stained with
sin, heart worn with suffering, mad with
Injustice, sick with fear.". And in her
vision: she sees more than that â her
son, the Savior, dying on the cross be
cause he sympathized with all that suf
fering and pitied all that sin.

WORK VALUABLE AT
PRESENT TIME.
Because of .the . great prominence in
politics that the question of government
control of railways is soon to be given,
the new book called "Restrictive Railway
Legislation." by Henry 8. Raines, will be
especially valuable at this time. \ Mr.
Haines was formerly vice president and
general manager of the "Plant System"
of railroad * and steamship lines, com
missioner of the Southern States Freight
Association, president of the American
Railway Association, and he Is the author
Of "American Railway Management."
His V occupations s have, therefore, given
him both the, opportunity and the incen
tive to comprehend railway* problems.
In the study .of .the relations of the
railways and the - state we had " ; two
standard works, before \u25a0 this work, 'of
Haines'. namely "Railroad Origin' and
Problems," by Charles /Francis Adams,
and "Railroad Transportation," by Presi
dent A. 0 T. Hadley. Mr. Adams' work
reached to 1878 and President Hadley's
to 1885. Mr, Haines -takes up his line of
thought \u25a0\u25a0 from the periods \where these

An important chapter in the- work is the
one called "Railroad Traffic." That chap
ter would be interesting just as a story
even were railroads to us of no economic
concern and the vast combination of their
power no threat to our liberties. The
main factor in the development of our
railroad traffic system 'to Its present
complicated condition Is competition.
There have been innumerable defeats and
victories, and founded upon these have
grown great channels and conditions of
trade, manufacture, commerce,
tion of all kinds, forming a perfect net
work of Interrelated interests; to disturb
i one of which would be to unsettle some
whole vast establishment of industry and
welfare. Other factors have been trick,
underhand, greedy schemes of manipulat
ors, secret rebates, favoritism to locali
ties and innumerable shrewd rascalities.
Through all the bewilderment of the
complication, one thing stands out clear,
and that is the need of the United States
to control the railway system with a strong ,
hand. Otherwise the private wealth of rail
way investment could ruin or enrich in
dividuals or firms at their own selfish ca-.
price, and hold the fate of whole com
munities in their irresponsible grasp. Far
more than that, they could defy and
boss the nation itself. They could vir
tually nullify as big a thing as the tariff
law and make the will of Congress in
that way of non-effect by the counter to
it of granting rebates to importers. They
could shift the prosperity or comparative
impoverishment of whole sections, as the
Atlantic seaboard, or the Gulf States, or
the Pacific coast, just as they might se
cretly elect to pull the vast lever of their
combinations. The power is too great for
the people to entrust to the uncontrolled
manipulations of non-elected and non
dischargeablesprivate owners.

TELLS OF BALZAC'S
GREAT WORK.
The greatness of the celebrated "Coine
die Humaine" is well appreciated in a re
cently published -series of seven essays
called "AsDects of Balzac." by W. H.
Helm, the author of "Studies in Style."
etc. Most of these are reprinted from the
"Empire Review." The more interesting
of the essays are the two called "The
Method of Balzac" and "Women of the
Human Comedy." In his estimate of the
voluminous novelist Helm says that he
essayed the most stupendous task that
any writer has ever undertaken, a task
before which that of Herbert Spencer
seems comparatively small. Although
Balzac did not live to complete his vast
undertaking as Spencer had tue good for
tune to. nevertheless Helm considers that
Balzac achieved "immeasurably" more
than any other student or painter of social
life has accomplished.
In. describing to us the method of Bal
zac Helm hastens first to point out the
seeming unsultableness of .the term,
"method" as applied to Balzac; for the
novelist believed that a man should go at
his work with a headlong fling and arrive
at things as one plunges into a gulf.
Still be finds that the principal method is
the study of passion in humanity, as it
exposed itself to his observation, and the
portrayal of it by putting his personal
passion of working . sympathetically into
all his pictures of the human comedy.
He quotes Balzac to the effect that pas
sion is all of humanity. Without it re
ligion, history/romance, art, would be
useless. He does not mean merely the
passion of man for woman, though that
is said to be more abundantly . set forth
in Balzac's novels than in those of any
other writer. In Felix de Vanuenesse and
Henriette de Mortsauf he describes a type
of love that is among the forces that
move the world. But he tells also of the
passion for power; the passion of the
artist to greatly paint; of the miser for
gold, and of the villainous to prey upon
humanity. ' ,
| The portrayal of human character was
he discovered to be his greatest
power, after he had vainly tried to attain
a fine style. By the trine he was 30 he
became convinced that style and the or
naments of literature were, beyond bis
reach, :.' and so he bent his energies to
characterization, for In that he knew he
was above rivalry. A part of his method
was to \ give very long introductory ex
planations of the social conditions sur
rounding hia characters, so as to prepare
us; the better to understand the people.
If any think . this process is tedious, the
answer of Balzac to them is that they
want the 'flower without the grain, the
infant without the , gestation. "Is art,
.then," : he says,; "stronger than nature?"
" Intuition was' his greatest gift,, and
his method of putting it to use; was to
make concentrated observations and
from these few build a whole char
acter, just as the great naturalists can
construct the picture of the whole ani
mal if you snow them one bone of It,
or- even a tooth or scale.V Another
method of .his, was to stop a story
at "the point where* the interest cul- ;
minates. He would not always carry a'j
love affair to the conventional ending ,
of marriage bells; forifTthe interest
culminated short of that, \u25a0so would he
; his jstory. In ; every xasr where \u25a0 the
poighacy, grows intense it comes aDout
naturally in ithe course of '.the story's
developments and he never forces what
is I called "piling ,up ' the r agony.", -He
had 'great' imagination, bujt- he linked
it, with the reporters' talent 'for noting:
,the actual andthe material.". He writes
ih.a'way to compel his reader, to think,
and to* hurry > over, his pages is futile
iff you wish their- full effect. Two
qualities \u25a0 you . must bring . to his read
"ing-^-patieiice* and reflection. .He be
lieved Mn : types, and that "not only
manklnd.;but the notable events of his
tory : were , represented by - types." He
made -. his j fictitious characters so real
to himself m the process of their crea-
Uon that he would talk about their
forthcoming affairs, marriages, etc..
with more interest than of those of tha
members of his own family. "Sympathy
with the failings of man. recognition or
the resistless power of fate, of heredity,
of environment, are clear in every novel
from his pen. It is in his belief in the
determination ef human actions that ha
stands in his treatment of character?
aud consequences the most apart from
the other great novelists."
That his essay on the "Women of the
Human Comedy" is important we may
know from the fact that Balzac's sub
ject was society and his leading char
acter woman ii> a hundred forma. A
large proportion of these'women werÂ«
frail In the English sense of tho word,
and Balzac would not allow his' own
nieces to read a majority of his books.
For these nieces he wrote "Ursula
Mirouet." wherein ho woman "goes
wrong." His ideal woman Is said to be
Madame de Camps. "Her raillery
caresses and her criticism does not
.wound; she neither harangues nor
argues, but Is pleased to conduct a dis
cussion and puts an end to it at thÂ«
right moment. â¢ â¢ â¢ She accepts
men as God made them, pitying the
bad. pardoning faults and absurdi
ties. â¢ â¢ â¢"
. Balzac- had a remarkable power of
making himself sympathetically onÂ«
with the characters he describes. So
great was his Intuition and Imaginative
power In this way that he could, for
the nonce, bo thus \u25a0 a woman In order
to understand the sex opposite to him
self. Henry James expressed this fac
ulty by saying: "He bears children with
Madame de l'Estorade. knows Intimate
ly how she suffers for them. â¢ â¢ â¢
Big as he is he makes himself small to
be handled by her with youngr maternal
passion and positively to handle her In
turn with infantile innocence.**

Hay and , Fecdstuffa.
Air conditions ' under \u25a0 this head remain" as
before. ..â¢: The private circular! of Scott & Mag
ner says of Hay:.
"During the week' Just passed we have re
ceived 35C8 tons.of Hay.
- "This amount shows a decidedly heavy In
crease .over the preceding week. The reason
for . this has been that much Hay has been
hurrieilin on the schooners from the bay shore
warehouses," and,- as the railroad company has
permitted the use |of morÂ» of its cars for Hay
shipments, we have received' increased arrival*
also on the Southern Pacific. . ">
. "As the demand has been only moderate and
with no ( particular- featur* | In the situation at
present to warrant any activity, . this ' market
generally- has shown somewhat of weakness.
ThreÂ© or four cars of gilt- edge Wheat . Hay
have sold at figures - above the topmost quota
tion, but ' " with these exceptions the better
grades of Wheat and -Wheat and Oat * Hay
have been sold ' at from ' $12 50 to $14 60 per
ton here. Choice tame Oat Hay brings $13
to |12 50. .
"The account of stocks of Hay on hand In
the Â« districts Â» tributary to . the San Francisco
market ils now being , taksn and , is ' expected to
show up about as; much on hand as was re
ported on November 1, 1 1904, which was In the
neighborhoods of 140,000. tons, v "v ,â¢
"The ' export demand -has been very quiet. .
The : Government Is not In "ij the market, -nor
do we . see anything at present ' which might
lead to any expectation of orders for the Orltnt.
"The Alfalfa Hay Is now practically all
cleaned up from the fields, and this particular
variety la therefore in better favor and. the
market "is stronger. .

market Is fairly steady." \u25a0

Orders are still arriving freely from the East

continue to strengthen under light receipts and
a good speculative demand.

527 passengers. Of the latter 665 were

one steamship for a long: time.
Among the cabin passengers were
army and navy officers. Government
enapojes bound for the Philippines,
business men, globe-trotters and mis
sionaries. The strong ebb tide made
the' work of getting the liner away
from the wharf a delicate operation, but

sion and the Siberia made a good de
parture.

NEVADA COUNTY OFFERS
WELCOME TO MINERS.
State Association's : New Departure Takes
Well in thefNorthern Part of California,
Two large gatherings of American min
ing men are in immediate view. The
one of most local interest is the annual
convention of the California Miners': As
sociation,- which will be. held at Nevada
City this month. The second in local im
portance. is the annual : gathering of the
M niing Congress,/ to be held this year at
'ErTaso. â¢ -' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0: \u25a0'"'\u25a0" '. :.::'.: .::'. '-' -V";-^;
â¢ The Nevada* County miners are 'extend
ing the glad hand to the California Min
ers' Association, and the new plan of nav
ir.g the convention each year in a> differ
ent place and in the sections where min
ing is. carried on is proving so : popul iv
that it is somewhat remarkable that it
was never thought of before!
r The Grass Valley .Union editorially wel
comes the convention and^ says- in p.nt
that "this county will give cordial w-eN
come to the mining men. Themening
at Nevada City this month is expected to
be one of the important ones in the his
tory of the organization." .
The executive committee of the Nevada
County Miners' Association has met and
elected officers, and. thus rehabilitate'!,
will perfect arangements for- the conven
tion. The prominence of Nevada County
as a mineral producing section had much
to do with the selection of'the first' meet
ing place outside of San Francisco to be
named.
MIIVES SHORT OF WATER.
The expected shutdown of mines in the
northern counties because the rains still
hold off. has actually taken place in mar y
localities. The mines of the Nevada City
district were generally suspended on the
first day of November. This action had
been anticipated for a fortnight. The re
serve supply of the South Yuba Company
had been decreasing steadily and quite
rapidly for several weeks before' the clos
ing was made compulsory by reason of
lack of the. customary motive power. The
Home mine has been run on half capacity
and may be closed soon. At the. Moun
taineer mine only the pumps were' left
going when the order was promulgated
to stop operations. The head of water at
this mine was reduced two-thirds, and a
part of the smaller supply, had to go to
the Sierra Queen mine to keep the pumps
running. The Murcme mine , was drop
ping five stamps at the last. report, but
this mine may be compelled to hang up
its stamps in idleness for. a time. At the
Lecompton and othermines in the district
there has been a practical stoppage of de
velopment and mill work.' The Champion
mint-, which has water from the Excelsior
company's ditch, was able to work about
as usual, but the outlook for continuing
depends on the rains, that are eagerly
desired in all the mining counties.
A large concrete dam has been erected
by the Omega Mining Company, in Scotch
mans Creek, about a mile above the town
of - "Washington, in Nevada County, pre
liminary to the resumption of hydraulic
mining. Some description, in view of the
general discussion of hydraulicking in this
State that has taken place recently, -is in
teresting. The dam is built between two
great bluffs of rock that extend into the
creek and towers upward 'fifty 'feet; It i&
thirty feet wide at the base and fifteen
feet wide at the top. It is a solid mass of
rock and cement. Rocks two yards wide
have been put into the dam, being hoist
ed with derricks operated, by steam. In
the center there is an outlet for water,
and a hard rock tunnel will . carry away
the suplus water. As soon as the com
pany gets a permit, so the local -papers
report, hydraulic mining at,; Omega will
be started. . *-\u25a0â¢ -\- ,- , \u25a0
: CONTRACTS ARBCLO^ED? - ;
The Tuolumne Independent reports
that important contracts , have .-been
closed that will mean much 'for the "min
ing development of Tuolumne' County.
A railroad from Angels by way of Val
lecito, Douglas Flat, to Murphys,
will be operateti in connection with a
smelting- plant. A smelter, 1 according
to the same authority, will be in opera
tion next June, with a dally capacity
of 200 tons.
A bond has been closed", for a tract
of 2600 acres hi Trinity: County, near
Trinty Center, for dredging by Dr. ,T.
R. Heintz of Redding. Up to date only
one gold' dredger has been operating
in Trinity County, but the bonding of
a large tract- may bring Mother ma
chines into the Trinity field. The ma
chine that has been running 'and ex
tracting gold is on the outskirts -of
Trinity Center. It is run by Payne
Bros, and an Illinois banker named
Keenan.' Operations have recently been
suspendc-d on account of the approach
of 'winter. Those in .charge of thla
dredger report that the results of last
season's work have been satisfactory.

electric power, furnished by. the Siski
you[ Electric Power Company, and has
been" kept running day. and night. If
the results are found entirely satisfac
tory/another, machine for. securing ,the
gold in the gravels will be installed on
Yreka ,Cruek. The cteel: basin, from
the mouth of the: creek to Yreka, a. dis
tance of five- miles, is large enough to
supply work for months to come.
(Buyers of n.ines have recently- ac
quired properties .\u25a0; in Mono and Shaeta
counties. The Mono County property
that has been taken in is the Monte
CristoOniine.- which has been 'bought by
a San Francisco man. A syndicate, ac
cording to the l:edding Searchlight, has
bonded what are known as tht%Dakin
properties at Kenneth These Include
the '.Uncle Sam mine and the 'Shasta
Coppermine. -A. force of men has been
set to clearing up in preparation for
development. . . , i
. The Uedding Searchlight is authority
for the statement that Joseph Porter
and a companion recently brought down
from the Bonanza mine in Trinity Coun
ty, which they liuve been working un
der bond. the. sum of $20,000. in gold,
which represented the clean-up from ;x
recent strike. . \u0084 .-,
Some, statements are made by corre
spondents at GoldfleM that are suffi
ciently striking, to attract "attention.
One is that il.Ot'o,ooo a month is gbins
into- Ooldfield, Tonopah and Bullfrog
for investment in mining shares, and
the spirit of speculation is abroad.
STRIKE RICH POCKET.
The Redding Searchlight reports tha 1 ;
within a 'few days of the expiration
of ' the lease on the Van Ness mine in
Trinity . County Supervisor Pranck,
Martin Foster and Charles Francis
struck a ' rich pocket from which t'i*y
took $25,000 in gold. The Van Xes.s
mine is . on. Trinity.,* Mountain, twelve
miles from French Gulch. It has been
a good -producer, but was supposed Jo
have been worked out long ago. The
property was leased only a few months
ago. This, says the Redding Search
light, was the second rich strike made
in Trinity County in two weeks, the
other beings in the Bonanza- King, near
Trinity Center.
Preparations for hydraulic mining on
a large. scale in the Cecilville district
in Siskiyou County, are in progress.
The Salmon River , Hydraulic Mining
Company, according to .the Yreka
Journal, is extending "Â« ditch and Hums
to Petersburg, a distance of three
miles. The ditch will carry 4t)00 Inches
of water for- seven or eight months
each year and will open up a large
amount of new ground as, soon as the
winter, storms begin. ... According to
the same journal it is probable that a
gold dredger will be placed on Cotton
wood Creek.
â¢San Francisco parties have b.een in
vestigating deposits of sandstone at
Henley, In Siskiyou. County. The de
posits crop out for a distance of sev
eral miles between Yreka and the Sis
kiyou Mountain and .nrougnout Shasta
Valley. â¢
The Shasta Courier says of the
transfer of the Balaklala that the con
sideration named is $625,000, but what
it is believed to be much larger. . The
Western Exploration Company 'trans
fers a half-interest in -the properly to
the White' Knob' Copper Company, cjVd

. .The following. :is taken . from .the
lledding Searchlight: "Forest Supervis
or; Barrett', showed the Quincy .Bulletin
a. map of -the extensive mineral laaÂ«l
locations made by H. H. Yard and as
sociates. ,The map, based upon " the
county records, shows that the loca
tions figure up : 205,000 ; acres. Of
course,. some portions of this have been
quitclaimed to previous locators, but
Mr. Yard's holdings embrace about
200,000 acres of the mineral lands of

Premier Will Be Asked

the* Poor.
Five Thousand Women to
Accompany Delegation
of Workingmen.
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
LONL'ON. Nov. 4.â A remarkable
demonstration will take place in this
city on Monday, when a delegation rep
resenting 1,000.000 unemployed Vmen
and' women of Great Britain will wait
up'-n Premier Balfour and urge the ne
cessity for heroic measures to avert the
terrors of a workless winter.- Five
thousand women, wives and daughters
of unemployed workingmen, will march
from the East End of London as an
cscoit for the delegation to Downing
street.
The deputation, which will speak In
the name of the organized labor of Lon
don, will by beadtd by Henry Quelch,
chairman of the Metropolitan Trades
Council, who to-day outlined the pur
poses which the v.-orkingmen have in
view. . . . . â¢ â¢- '
\u25a0\u25a0Approximately 750.000 men and 250,
Â©OO women are out of work in the
United Kingdom," said Quelch. "They
represent 3,000,000 dependents, who are
lace to face with a breadless and fuel
less, and, in some cases, rooflc.*s win
ter. These people are not a pack of
lazy incompetents. They are men and
women who are able and willing to do
k day's work, but for whom the private
labor market affords no hope.
"We shall not approach Mr. Balfour
as supplicants for charity. We shall
point out that it is the state's duty to
wrestle with the serious and pitiable
economic problem which this horde of
hungry and idie citizens presents. We
shall ask that a special session of Par
liament be called to vote money for na
tional public works, such as the
reclamation of waste lands, reforesta
tion and road building. These will be
useful works that will give immediate
employment to -hundreds of thousands.
"The pathos and urgency of the sit
uation cannot be exaggerated. The
organs of the aristocracy are assailing
our demonstration as socialistic, but
Great Britain U confronted with a con
dition, not a theory. The time has
passed for controversy by doctrinar
ians. What is needed is action."

ST. LOUIS. Nov. 4.â State Insurance
Superintendent Vandiver said positive
ly to-day that unless the .New York Life
Insurance- Company had complied with
his demands, to reimburse the' polio
holders to the amount of $155,000, paid
as contributions to the Republican cam
paign fund, and had elected new offi
cers in place of the present oues by
Tuesday, November 7. he wo.uld revok.e
the company's license and thus prohibit,
it from further carrying pn business in
Missouri. â¢ â
. '"Xo jood reason has been presented
to me showing why this should' not' bo
done" said V.uidlver." '.'The thirty days
which I allowed the company, to meet
my requirements will expire dn Tues
day. According to my information John
A. MeCall is still "president of the com
pany, and the campaign contributions
are- still charged up' to the expenses
of the company: Xo changes have been
made in the personnel of the company's
officers. Hence I feel' that it Is my duty
to act promptly and decisively.
"The revoking' of the license would
have no effect whatever upon the pol
icies already in existence, except to
force upon the officers of the company
the necessity cf returning- to the policy
holders the dividends that are due to
then instead of squandering these div
idends in reckless _ and extravagant
management, high salaries and polit
ical lobbying purposes.
"The only thingr# effected by the re
voking- of the license would be the is
suing of new policies. They would not
be allowed to write any -new. policies
so lonp as the revocation or suspension
of the license migm remain in force/*
It is hinted that Messrs. Judson and
Crowe, St. Louis counsel for the New

which will be presented either, to the
State Supreme Court or one of the St.

surance Commissioner Vandiver be en
joined from revoking the company's

Most ofthe poisonous materials retained in the system by the checked

What can be done about this ? Of course, a careful avoidance of aU expo**

careful ventilation of the sleeping rooms, and the avoidance of drafts. The

NEW ORLEANS, Nov..4.âA clash be

through charges preferred against the

From these charges, which are qori-l

appears .that the '> police -objected 'to
Federal supervision of the rniimber of
passengers to be permitted, on the Co
mus, the vessel chartered' to take the
President and prominent citizens on "a
river excursion. While Cotter was
counting the passengers j going - aboard

taken . to' the outskirts 'of /the v crowd

Berlin Government Ready
to Enter * Upon Negotia
tions Witli Washington
>. WASHINGTON, Nov. 4. â Baron Speck
yon bterhburg, the German Embasaador,
called upon Secretary Root at the State
Department to-day and notified him that'
Germany was ready to negotiate a new
trade treaty with America. . The Baron
told the Secretary that a change must
be had in the treaty relations between
the two countries, and that. . realizing:
the dangers of a tariff war, Germany
was anxious , to effect some arrange
ment ,wiin' the United States that would
insure a- continuance of good feeling
and' make for. the, industrial develop
ment of both countries. Therefore he
said his Government had instructed him
to give notice that Â«t was ready to en-:
ter upon negotiations for a trade treaty.
He did hot use the word "reciprocity."
Secretary Root gave assurance of his
earnest desire to do everything pos
sible to avert trouble. He wished only
to be shown the opportunity to nego
tiate a treaty that would secure the
approval of the United States Senate.
*. was not his intention, he said, to
evade any responsibility by preparing
a treaty which the Senate could not ac
cept, his belief being that there should
be no attempt to divide responsibility
between the different branches of the
American Government. Therefore he
would send to the Senate no treaty that
did not, in his judgment, meet the
wishes of that body. It would be .by no
means certain â in fact it was doubtful â
that he could succeed in framing such
a convention and he earnestly wished
( to be shown the basis for promising
'negotiations. #\ .* ..
Baron Sternburg did not attempt to
go into details in his presentation, but
it developed th#t as soon he could
show that he had the basis of a treaty
which the Senate would be likely to
ratify Secretary. Root would immediate
ly send it to the tariff experts for re
port.
GUNBOAT PETREL. TO REMAIN
at mare: island navy yard
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4.â There have
been several surveys made of the gun
boat PetreKat the Mare Island- navy
yard, where the vessel 'is destined to
remain indefinitely. An investigation
showed that the Petrel is still in good
condition, but. that it would be advan
tageous to expend about $20,000 in re
pairs.' The Navy Department has de
cided, however, that it would be more
advantageous to keep the Princeton in
commission instead of the Petrel and
that work on, the latter vessel should
be confined to what is absolutely neces
sary to preserve the vessel from de
terioration. ' ... . â¢' ... â¢

IS 'ACaUITED BY JURY

Pladns Deadly Food to Kill
Shee^faJUera.
SANTA ROSA, Nor. 4^â Edward Rob
erts of Sebastopol has been acquitted
by a jury of poisoning' his neighbors'
dogs. The case attracted considerable
attention, owing to the fact that many
fine animals In this county have re
cently beei} poisoned. It was shown
that Edwards placed poisoned meat on
his premises to protect his sheep, but
that he had warned his neighbors of
his intentions after repeated efforts to
find whose dogs were the offenders.
Warm friendships are not likely to
be fused in heated arguments.
If you care not for the /fes&}^-?
name, then you care not for /mnsS^L
the piano. If you care about J^liliwilJiliSi^?'-^
the kind of piano, then you ' y
must needs choose the name. l^^i^^X^vmn <f ' f^
A person to whom it 1
makes no difference what gjjgij, ,J!jlSliÃÃsL---rJ
name is on his piano, then iC
can be said that he will r ~'
hardly be restricted in hi? ff $1^*1; W
choosing. Tlie world is full %^*
of pianos with all sorts of
names. .Some of them we
have heard of, many that
probably we have not heard of, but we hear of a new one
every little while.
\u25a0 ALSO IN THE WAY OF PRICE
person cares not what name is on his piano, then he need
pay no more than $00.50 for a piano. Pianos have been advertised
at this price. But if you would have a piano that is a piano in
other ways than mere shape, if you would have a piano that is new
and is a musical instrument, then it will cost more than Soo'^o,
and your choosing will be restricted; considerably so, too. for there
are not so many strictly hieh-grade pianos. There is only' one
Stcinway piano. There is only one A. B. Chase piano. Only' one
Estey, one Emerson. Of course, there are other pianos than these-
we cannot enumerate them all here, but these we have mentioned
are of the best. Confine your choice to one of these makes and
you will not have missed choosing well. You will" have secured
also, a piano at the lowest possible price consistent with the best
quality.

BULL AWAITING OEDEK-S
Former Commander of the
Solace Succeeds in Evading
Duty on Kef rigerator Ship
Sifdal Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Nov. 4.â lt has been decided
by the Navy Department 'to send the tor
pedo-boat destroyer Paul Jones to Hono-"
lulu with the Perry, which haa orders to
leave Mare Island 'on the 16th ins t. The
little vessels are now undergoing repairs
In the eteam" engineering department at
the navy yard. The crulÃer Marblehead
will also be ready to sail from here on
the 16th*inst., but up to the present time
her destination, has not been announced.
The Impression here Is that she will make
a cruise in Australian waters tn answer
to the petition of American citizens who
live In that part of the world.
Captan J. H. Bull, formerly of the So
lace, who waÂ» transferred to the refriger
ator ship Celtic, which is to be attached to
the Atlantic station, has succeeded in
having his orders revoked and Is now
awaiting orders at Mare Island. A line
officer Is to be placed in charge of the
magazine at Mare Island and It is said
that Bull Is straining every effort to get
this desirable billet.
Lieutenant Stanley "Wood, in command
of the submarines at Mare Island, has
been transferred to the gunboat Concord,
now at Bremerton. "Wood has caused a
great deal of newspaper notoriety since
coming to Mare Island. During a dense
fog last winter he ran the navy yard tug
on the beach at Angel Island and was se
verely reprimanded. Later on the crew
of the submarine Pike refused to dive
while Wood was In charge of the steering
gear, and while there was some talk at
the time of punishing the crew, nothing
was ever done about the matter.
Lieutenant Frank H. Schofield has been
relieved of the command of the Perry by
Lieutenant Frederic Freeman of the bu
reau of steam engineering. Acting Car
penters Charles J. Kerr, James J. Murphy,
P. R. Dickson, Mike Carroll and F. XV.
Mehlop have been detached from Mare
Island and ordered to the Asiatic station
by the transport Lawton, which sails
from Mare Island early in December. All
of these young officers are well known
residents of Vallejo.
The navy yard mechanics are rushing
work on the repairs to the boilers of the
Lawton in order to have the transport
ready to sail for the Orient early in De
cember. The ship will carry a big cargo
of supplies and ammunition for the naval
stations at Honolulu, Guam and Cavite.
The crew Is not at all pleased with the
orders, which' will cause them to spend
the holidays at soa.

POLICE PROBE
GIRL'S DEATH
Body Is Found Weighted
Down With a Heavy Stone
by the Side of a Bridge
VICTIM OF VIOLENCE
Theory Is Advanced That She
Was Killed by Her Sweet
heart, Who Is Now Missing
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Nov. 4.â The
dead body of Winona Charlotte New
ton, aged 15 years, daughter of Thomas
Newton, a painter, was found to-day
beside a bridge over a small stream
near Fifty-fifth street and College ave
nue, on the outskirts of the city. The
erlrl evidently had been murdered. Her
face) had been disfigured by many cuts,
there were finger marks on her throat
and a atone weighing 150 pounds
weighted down the body. The police
are looking for a young man with
whom she had been keeping company.
A hasty examination by the Deputy
Coroner at the undertaking rooms to
which the body was taken disclosed
that the stomach contained large quan
tities of acid, but the officers assert
that death resulted from violence be
fore the add had time to act. Above
the right eye was a cut made by a
blow delivered with such force that
the skull had been fractured.- The po
lice believe- that the girl went to the
bridge last night to meet her sweet
heart and that they quarreled, after
which the girl swallowed the acid in
an attempt to commit suicide, but that
she was murdered -before the drug
took effect.
Another theory Is that the girl and
her sweetheart had agreed to commit
suicide, that after the girl swallowed
the acid the man weakened and when
she screamed from the effects wrought
by the poison the man killed her to
quiet her.
Miss Newton recently had brooded
over her physical condition.
The spot at the bridge where the
girl's body was found was but 150 feet
from her home. She had frequently
met her sweetheart at the bridge. She
was last seen alive at 8 o'clock last
night, when she put a shawl over her
head and ran out of the house, taking
a cup, apparently to get a drink of
water at the well.

ly sixty years, a furrier, who died Thurs

erward followed. He wrote home that no
bility was. no longer a matter of concern
to him in* a free country, where all men
were sovereigns. After that he held no
communication with his noble relatives
until his cousin ascended the throne of
Servia. when he sent his congratulations
as a kinsman.
The old man's coffin bears a silver plate
emblazoned with the royal arms of Ser
via and the Inscription:
"Prince John of Belgrade, Servia, died

How to Test "Hair Dyes" Containing Sugar of
Lead (Poison) and Sulphur
TJ "."\u25a0â¢*
I FEEL It Is my solemn duty, as an analytical chemist familiar with the facts, to sound a
note of warning to users of hair dyes. The market is flooded with dyes 'that are not only
Injurious to the hair, but endanger the health of every person who uses them.
These preparations, variously advertised as "hair dyes," "hair renewers," "hair re-
storers," etc., are in the majority of cases solutions containing nothing more nor less than
Sugar of Lead and Sulphur.
And, Reader, Sugar of Lead Is â POISON!
In Justice to the public, every bottle of hair dye containing these substances should bear
tbe poison label and the poison emblem â tbe skull and rross bone*!
Thousands of people who have no idea that they are playing? with fire, are using these
preparations, and not knowing of anything better, arc slaves to them!
Now I am going to tell you how yon can detect the presence of Lead and Sulphur with-
out going to the expense of a chemical analysis.
The manufacturer of every Sulphur and L<Â«ad preparation gives emphasis "to the direc-
tions â "SHAKE THE BOTTLE BEFORE USING!"
\VTiy? Simply because the Sulphur and the Lead settle to the bottom of the bottle, form-
ing a tblÂ«Â»t sediment, and you mnwt shake the bottle and stir up this sediment, for It's the
sediment that does the vrork! Here is the test: Don't shake the bottle!
Just try to dre the hair with the clear liquid at the top and the stuff will fall absolutely
to color the liair.
So the vendoro of these dyes are always shouting â "Shake the Bottle!"
Lead and sulphnr make the hair sticky and greasy, and the stuff rubs off on everything
It touches.
There's another "old-timer" â the "two-bottle" dye, that's so popular with, many hair
shops. No one but an expert can use this properly, and the customer 'must, as a rule, pay
dearly to have It applied (from $5 to $15). Then, in a very short time, the gray hairs at the
roots must be retouched (by the expert) and another fee paid.
Right here Is where the real trouble begins, for the hair then takes on two and some-
times more colors, and the effect Is startling, to say the least. After the first application the.
hair has a "dyed" appearance that does not fool anyone but the user. But when a variety of
colors appear, even tho victim of the "expert" awakens to the shame of the situation.
Many people had a good head of hair when beginning the use of the "two-bottle" prepa-
ration or the "shake-before-using" mixture, but aft*-r two or three years, thin, short hair
â¢was their reward. In some cases the eyes and head are affected by the Sugar of Lead, and
the victim presents a truly pitiful appearance. The method by which these harmful nostrums
are commended to the confidence of the public consists in the liberal use, of so-called "testi-
monials." If you only stop to think, your own common sense will tell you'that no disinterest-
ed person would permit the use of his or her name in an advertisement, particularly for hair
dye. The very fact that one uses a hair dye is evidence of a desire to conceal the pres-
ence of gray hair. But even If any could be found honestly, do you suppose they would f
be willing to answer a hundred letters a day Just for the tnn of It? "Would yon, Reader, do
It for nothing?
Intelligent people will not be led astray by cunningly worded "testimonials" â tha v
real meaning is too transparent.
Thousands of men and women have learned by sad experience the truths above stated.

interest in the famous claim known as
No. 1. below Discovery, Little .Creek,

not then open for location and would not
be* until the following January, and asked
her not to record the location. The plain

ant that each should hold an equal share
in the property, when \it should be staked.
She avers that the defendant has extract

the ol aim and that he has invested the
same in such manner as to hide its place
of investment from her. On these grounds
she claims a half Interest in the property,
and damages amounting to $250,000.

Costs- Him His Life
George Murphy, .13 years of age, was
fatally injured by the explosion of a gas
oline tank near old St. Mary's College on
the San Bruno road yesterday. He died
an â¢ hour later at St. Luke's Hospital.
His brother, James', 15 years old, was
seriously injured. 'â¢ \u25a0:\u25a0- \u25a0 - ..
The Murphy boys and. a. crowd of younp
friends were playing in a vegetable gar
den behind the* old college building.. They
came across the tanks, which were sup
posed to be empty.
Little George ran up to one of them
saying, "Let's see if the thing will go
off," and drew some matches from his
pocket.
"Don't do it." said part of the crowd.
"Go ahead/1 said the rest. The little fel
low lit a match and held it near the
tank.
His brother, James, made a rush toward
him to drag him away. Just -as he was
about to seize the laughing" boy a jet of
flame burst from the tank. Both brothers
were hurled for several yards. The other
boys ran away shrieking.
Some men working in the vegetable gar
den hurried to the scene. Little George
was found in an unconscious condition.
There 'being ,no better conveyance at
hand, the injured boy was placed lp a
vegetable wagon and taken to St. Luke's
Hospital. He died shortly after arriv
ing there, without recovering conscious
ness.
James Murphy was badly burned on the
hands and face. He was taken to his
home. 3454 Mission street. None of the
other bos's were Injured.
George Murphy, the dead boy, was a
remarkably bright little fellow. George
had been living with > -his brother and
relatives at S4S4 Mission street, their
mother being dead and their father being
out of town on business.
The police are trying to find out who is
the owner of the gasoline tanks. , -

LIEUTEXAXT BURR MAY
ESCAPES COURT-MARTIAL
Gay Yoang Officer's Reaismatlon May
Be Accepted by the War De
partment.
Lieutenant Frank S. Burr, Fifteenth
Infantry, may escape the court-martial
that is now hanging over his head. He
has sent in his resignation. As the
acceptance of the resignation by the
department has received the indorse
ment of several members of his regi
ment there Is a possibility that it may
be. accepted. In this case his trial will
not take place and he will be allowed
to retire from the United States army.
Burr la under arrest at the Presidio of
Monterey. . â¢ .
â¢ Besides the gay' life which he has
been leading that brought him to . his
present position, .lt is rumored that he
has. run heavily in debt in the differ-,
ent posts in which he has been sta
tioned during the last , , three years.
Illness and dissipation are responsible
for his present condition. .
Before Burr enlisted as a private in
the army he was a member of a min
strel company, where his fine voice
and talents brought him considerable
recognition by the public. He had only
been in the service for a little over a
year, when by acts of heroism and
bravery he .was made a .commissioned
officer.

ensued between the twoV'with' the result
that both men fell down on the platform
and finally rolled off Into the street.- In
the meantime the women on the car be-*
gan to scream and jumped to the street'
5n all directions. The cause of the dis
turbance was finally knocked senseless by

when a trolley wire at Shattuck ave
nue and Center street was broken by a
Key route train's diamond trolley at
tachment. A marvelous electrical dis
play resulted from the accident and as
the moving- trolley car carried the de
tached wire iilor-.g. a series of explo
\u25a0lons wore heard. The wire bumped
the ground at intervals of a few sec
onds, each time sending out blinding
flashes of flame, frightening pedes
trians, who fled from the vicinity as
though a battery of howitzers was be
ing discharged on the spot.
A horse attached to a wagon belong
ing to Mason A: MeDuffie. standing at
the corner of Center street and Shat
tuck avenue, was stunned by the shock
of the live wire, as it passed within a
few Inches of the animal's head, and
dropped to the ground as if dead.
Wilmer Miller, a driver for Sandoz &
Sanderson, coal dealers, had a very
narrow escape from death. The de
tached wire broke just over his head
and Miller ducked forward a bit just
as it snapped. The movement saved
his life, for the deadly wire passed
within a few inches of his head.
Motorman Ogle was In charge of the
.Key route train which broke the elec
tric wire. He could give no explana

fic on the Key route was delayed for a
brief time. None of the passengers on

FINDS HE WAS
NEVER MARRIED
OAKLAND. Xov. 4.â T. B. Crabtree,
living at 362 Eleventh street, who brought
an action of divorce against a person
whom he designated as Mrs. Martha M.
Crabtree, was not only denied- a divorce
to-day by Judge Waste, but it was also*
held that they had never been married
and that his plea for a part of her prop
erty, valued at $30,000, was void.
The defendant in the divorce action was
the widow of John Taylor, a wealthy La
fayette farmer, who died, leaving her all
of his property. In a, contest of his will
brought by the daughter of Taylor by a
former wife she tried, to show that the
widow was not legally the wife of her
father, but the wife of Crabtree, and in
this she failed. Then Crabtree brought
his suit for divorce, and he was confront
ed by Mrs. Taylor's attorney with a
signed statement made by Crabtree that
they had never been married and releas
ing her from any claim he might have
upon her. He was then placed in the po
sition of swearing to the allegations in
his complaint and to directly the opposite
state of affairs in his statement.
Upon this showing Judge Waste dis
missed the action and held that Crabtree
had no standing in court.

CHOOSES MODE
OF HER DEATH
Ethel Cook Says Logan Told
Her to Select Razor or
Laudanum, for Suicide
GIKL; PILFERS POISON
Child Enticed From Home by
Disgraced Trustee Gives
Sensational Testimony
OAKLAND, Nov. 4.â "Just before Mr.
Logan purchased the laudanum which he
ga.ve me when we .were arrested at Med
ford he offered me the alternative of
either ending my life with a razor of hits
or dying by poison, and, naturally, 1
chose poison."
This was the statement made this
morning by Ethel Cook, the schoolgirl
who was enticed from her home by Henry
A. Logan, formerly a trustee of the First
Free Baptist Church, during cross-exam
ination this morning by Judge A. L.
Frick, who is conducting Logan's defense
on the charge of child-stealing. The state
ment was made In response to a question
of the defense as to whether or not she
knew Logan's reason for buying the poi
son at the Ashland' drug store. The girl's
answer made It clear that the man who
deserted his wife and child, leaving them
penniless in this city, was determined to
evade the consequences of his act by end
ing not only his own life, but that of the
girl as well.
Ethel Cook was recalled to the stand
this morning, and Judge Frick at once be
gan a searching cross-examination of the
prosecuting witness on her testimony 'of
yesterday. - The defense this morning
proved conclusively by the answers of the
girl that she had gone willingly with Lo
gan and knew at the time she left her
hf me that ne intended to desert his wife
and child. She also acknowledged that
she had asked him to take her away wltn
him.
From the questions of Judge Frick It
seems certain that the defense will at
tempt to prove that the girl, instead of
being enticed from her home by Logan,
went with him willingly, and even urged
him to take her with him.
Upon conclusion of the cross-examina
iion of the girl B. B. Clawson, proprietor
of the Elaterite Roofing Company, testi
fied that Logan's statement that he had
left the employ of the company because
there was an attachment on the works
was false. " .-
Professor S. P. Meads of the Oakland
High School identified the letter receievd
from Logan by Mrs. Ross, mother of
Ethel Cook, and Captain of Police Adel
bert Wilson told of finding the laudanum
bottle concealed on Logan's person when
he was searched at Medford.
This closed the side of the prosecution,
and the; case was continued to Friday,
November 17, for argument.
ATTACK OF SAVAGE
DOGRJNHINGES MIND
Little Girl Growls- and Bites
as Eesult of Terrible
Fright: ;
Her health' destroyed through the at
tack of a eavage.dog, the property of
Richard McCann, a wealthy contractor,
little Dorothy Feeney filed suit yesterday
through her mother, Frances Feeney, to
recover $25,000 damages from McCann to
In a measure compensate her for all of
the suffering she has undergone.
"Subject to periods of fright," says
Mrs. Feeney in the suit, "Dorothy Feeney
whila'thus afflicted growls and bites like
a dog. She is capable of no intelligent
act, her mental and physical health
stroyed forever." .
On July 15 last, when Dorothy Feeney,
then 10 years of age, was playing on the
street an immense and savage mastiff be
longing to McCann attacked her, knock
ing her down and severely injuring her.
The fright of that day. says her- mother,
has left her a wreck, and as McCann
â¢well knew that the dog was savage and
dangerous to be at large he should be
compelled to pay for the suffering her
daughter has undergone as a result of its
attack. Mrs. Feeney is represented by
Attorney William M. Cannon.

ball defeat . In her history at American
League Park this afternoon,. being beaten
by. the.score of 53 to'O. It was Yale's

quired more than one play to make it
first down. Tripp, . Bigelow and Forbes
comprised an irresistible secondary attack
and Devlin was" always, good for five or
ten yards. He made one ninety-yard dash
from the klckoff through the whole Co
lumbia team and over the goal line, but
the ball was brought back for holding.
The teams were made up of the following
players: \u25a0

a teamster employed on the Phoenix
Gulch dam by Contractor Andrew Erlck
son, was arrested to-day by Deputy Sher
iff Frank Farrell for robbing his tent
mate, "Dutchy" Haflin. of $104 last night.
He at first denied the theft, but later
when brought to the County Jail he ac
knowledged his guilt to Constable Hughes.
The only -reason he could give was that
he wanted to send the money to his
mother in Ireland. An international post
office money order for $100 drawn In San

Dublin, Ireland, was found in his wallet.
Callow is an ex-British aprentlce. He

are living in Dublin, Ireland. He has a
good appearance and evidently has been
well raised.

WOULD BUILD
A BOULEVARD
Road Giving a Magnificent
Marine View Is Suggested
for County of San Mateo
OPPORTUNITY IS GREAT
Drive Along the Beach From
Martini's to Lighthouse
Planned by Suburbanites
HALFMOON BAY, Nov. 4.â ln conneo
tion with the remarkable development of
this part of San Muteo County the sug
gestion is made that It would be a splen
did piece of public policy to construct at
public expense a modern beach boulevard,
extending from Martini's on the north to
Furissima on the south and connecting In
one long drive Halfmoon Bay. the new
town of Balboa, the wharf at Aroeaport.
Seal Cove, Moss Beach and the lighthouse
at Point Montara. Such a road as this
would be without parallel on the PaclSo
Coast and would have few equals In the
world. The marine view it would afford,
would be unsurpassed. Those who are
urging the proposition are convinced that
it will have a very material effect on real
estate values in this part of the country.
IT. S. GRAND JURY MAKES
FINAL REPORT AND ADJOURNS
The United States Grand Jury pre
sented its final report to United
States District Judge de Haven yes
terday afternoon and was discharged
with the thanks of the court for hav
ing so faithfully and conscientiously
performed its duty. The charges
against James Ernest and M. Petersen
were ignored. Ernest was accused of
having withheld on a claim for debt
the pension papers of Robert yon
Schllck. Petersen was accused of hav
ing been In possession of a fraudulent
naturalization certificate. He had been
naturalized legally at Merced, but
when he came to San Francisco he ob
tained a fraudulent certificate, having
been Informed by a grafter that the
Merced certificate would not be recog
nized In San Francisco.
Additional indictments were present
ed against the following for perjury
and being in possession of fraudulent
naturalization certificates: Hans Mor
thensen, Rendolf Rasmussen, John
Svensen, Andrew Thomsen. Sven Fern
strom and John O. Odland. The former

dictments are under section 5425 ana
charge them with using fraudulent na
turalization papers.
SUSPECTED BOMB EXPLODER
IS PLACED UNDER ARREST
Timothy Golden, who is employed in
the tunnel of the Southern Pacific
Company at the Six-Mile House, was
arrested yesterday afternoon by Po
liceman T. P. . Smith. He is suspected
of being the man who exploded a giant
powder bomb on the window sill of
Michael McAullffe's saloon at Fifth and
Natoma streets about 10 o'clock on
Friday night. The plate glass window
and sash were blown out, but no other
damage was done.
Shortly before Golderv's arrest he
went into the saloon, and said to 'the
bartender: "You had better look out, '
Bill, there will be a worse one to
night/* The bartender jumped to the
conclusion that Golden meant the ex
: plosion, and notified the police. Golden
was so drunk that he was unable to
talk when arrested. He is familiar
with the use of giant powder and thÂ»
police say they have the name of a
woman who saw Golden near the sa
loon a few minutes -before the explo
sion. He had been drinking In thÂ« .
neighborhood for several days. ,fThe Shield of

PEOPLE MAKE MIGHTY DEMONSTRATION FOR PARTRIDGE
FRANCIS J. HENEY FLAYS THE GRAFTING BOSS
FLASHLIGHT PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MIGHTY TH^
Fifteen Thousand Citizens Fill the Mechanics^ P
to Annihilate Municipal Gorriiption; in the City of San Francisco
The climax to one of the most ex
traordinary political """" battles ever
fought in the city of San Francisco was
reached last night when 15,000 men and
women gathered at the Mechanics' Pa
vilion to sound their loyalty to the
cause of good government, of civic de
cency and of honest administration in
public affairs.
No more impressive civic demonstra
tion than that of last night has been
witnessed in the city *y the Golden
Gate since the days the tocsin was
pealed to bring together the Vigilantes
of pioneer days.
It was the revolt of the people
against the boodling corruptionists who
have defamed San Francisco for four
ytears. It was the voice of decency, ac
claiming the man who stands as. the
representative of cleanliness in the bat
tle against knavery- John S. Partridge
received such a welcome from that tre
mendous throng last night as must
have made the faith still stronger in
him when he gave the word:
"We have made the fight and we
have won."
And after hours of eloquent, earn
est, sincere appeal to the voters of San
Francisco to stand by the men who
\u25a0were banded against vice and graft,
this magnificent audience poured Into
the streets, formed, into procession,
and, with banners waving:, bands.play
ing and cheering incessant, marched
down Market street by thousands as
escort to the; gallant leader who had
closed the campaign so gloriously.
IX THE AUDITORIUM.
A fitting close this .was .. to a contest
which will live in > the records as one of
the most remarkable inthe annals of any
city. The scene In the great auditorium
was a spectacle* the like of which \ ' has
rarely been witnessed In this- city; PolJ
tlcs. partisanship,, prejudice, personality,
everything was, swept a^Toe for the one
groat objectâ the defeat of the band of
thieving officials, the smashing of the
Ruef-Schmitz regime that has disgraced
and shamed San _ Francisco. Here was
the keynote of this popular uprising. All
through the speeches rang the. one' sentlr
: ment. Men who -had fought each other
for yeara In. partisan strife were here
presenting a* solid to the tgraft
ing foe. . Republicans. and Democrats,. yes,
but in this struggle to save the city. from
wretched Blavery they were . as' one man."
ARILVY OF SPEAKERS. . .
There was Francis J. Heney. the in
cisive, earnest, logtcal'flayer of graft, the
man selected by Theodore Roosevelt to
punish the rogues in high station who
had robbed . the -United . States Govern
ment. There was the eloquent Frank "H."
Gould, clean and forcoful.. a splendid
fighter for the right. .There was Henry
U. Brandenstein, honest,, tried and strong
in the line of battle { for civic righteous
ness. There was Daniel A^ Ryan, â¢ the
leader, of the fusion campaign commit-,
tee. ' There- was the witty . Charles 'A. r
Swelgert, whose sallies wjcre. as keen as
a blade of Damascus. There was " E.
Myron Wolf, who. presided, in' splendid
voice, appealing with clarion ring for the
upraisifg, of
There was \Wa shins ton Dodge, hon
ored by air of "his fellow-citizens, -who
cleanly, punctured' the Schmitz claims
of responsibility/ for;.the , city's" prosf

DEFEATS SCHEME TO APPOINT NO FUSION
ELECTION OFFICERS IN THIRTY-NINTH.
W. H. Hazell Appears Before Commissioners and Forces
Them to Change Their Original Selections.
TV. H. Hazell appeared before the
Election Commission yesterday and
protested against the appointment of
Felix McMann as a Republican elec
tion officer in the First Precinct of the
Thirty-ninth Assembly District. Hazell
objected to McMann on the ground that
he had filed two applications last year
as a Democrat to act as an election
officer. McMann admitted that he had
signed one of the applications, but
\u25a0wore that he voted as a Republican
at the last primary and also voted
for Roosevelt for President and Pardee
tor Governor. McMann said, however,
that he had voted as a Democrat at
the primary preceding the election or
Governor Pardee.
Commissioner of Works Maestrettl
argued that McMann was qualified to
act. as a Republican in the light of his
having voted as a Republican at the
last general election. Maeetretti and

surance to the public that John J. Grelf Is

A CONSTANT READER.
Raises a Technical Point.
When the case of Charles Boyle,
charged with assault with intent to
commit robbery, was called in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday for the de
fendant to plead, Attorney Guilfoyle
made a motion to set aside the infor
mation. He raised the point that the
defendant was held to answer by Po-
Jice Judge Fritz, but during the pre
liminary hearing continuances were
granted by Police Judge Cabanlss dur
ing Fritz's absence. This, Guilfoyle
contends. Invalidate* the- proceedings.
The motion was taken under advise

ask the Police Judges to meet him to
discuss the point.

KORWBGIAXS GIVE ANNUAL CALL.â
The Norwegian Club Fram . gave its seventh

Hall. 414 Mason street, last evening. The
Â«JecoraUonÂ» were very artistic and with thfe
aid of the pood music the large crowd present
bad every opportunity for a good time.- The

of graft meet, there is absolute confidence
In the Judgment of the people and com
plete assurance that Partridge will.- be
elected Mayor by a majority exceeding
8,000. There is not the .vestlga -or Sem
blance of doubt as to the victorious out
come of the battle. Events of the last
week have inspired theiWorke,rs and "lead
er with renewed' courage. ;
The- weakening of the grafters is every 7
where perceptible. It Is well known that
discord and dissension exist In the camp
of the boodlers. The union labor men who
are behind Schmitz look upon Ruef with
the keenest suspicion. P. H. McCarthy is
regarded as a "hoodpo." When the defeat
of Schmitz is announced many of the
workingmen will ascribe the result to the
presence of McCarthy and his pernicious
activity. The old-time leaders and organ
izers of the labor -column are taking no
hand in the campaign to help Ruef and
McCarthy.
The shameful "hold up" of the park ,la
borers to swell Ruef's campaign fund was
a topic of comment In political > circles
yesterday.' The forced contribution from
the wages of workingmen in ..the service
of the city was contrary to the. letter and
eplrit of the charter, and all. in all the
most cruel hold; up of -.Ruefs desperate
and despicable campaign. ''-'.' '
Hazell engaged in a wordy tllt,\ when
Hazell remarked that he did not place
any confidence in the six election of
ficers appointed in. the precinct, as not
one of them intends to. vote for Part
ridge, but are all in sympathy, with the
Schmitz administration. Maestrettl
said "It would be a "reflection on" -the
family of McMann vlf he ; we're not
sworn in as an election . officer after
having been selected for the position. :
"I am not objecting to McMann per
sonally," Â£aid Hazell. "All we want is
a square deal. The law requires bi-:_
partisan representation on. election
boards l and we are not getting , any
representation. In ; this precinct, j. ~ ln.
view of* past experiences in the' *Thir-"
ty-nlnth District, the fusion- party
wants to be represented., .. If the .law
had been obeyed .last year several
young men would not have â¢ had their
reputations ruined : ln this community."
Commissioners , Devoto and Voor
sanger finally asked Hazell If he would
of his office, but has completely wiped out the
legacy of back work lelt him by his pre
6ecessorÂ£. * -
The value of Mr. Grelf 's work can be
readily understood not only by the public but
more particularly by attorneys and searchers
of records, who are specially familiar with
the condition of affairs which existed some
months prior to his term of office. It
is Eafe to say that when he assumed charge
the office was apparently without any system.
Many important legal papers were missing or
had been mislaid, estates were tied -up by
reason of the delays \u25a0 and non-recordln* of
judicial orders, and thousands of papers had
been pl>d on the floor or stacked up In out
of the way corners and wholly undistributed.
This condition of things has been changed
and the office is now conducted in a manner
which gives entire satisfaction to the mem
bers of the bench and bar. Signed:

The campaign of the Union Labor party
is drawing to a close. Last evening the
candidates on the ticket made hurried
visits to, many different halls of the city,
said a few words to the crowds that were
gathered, then rushed to another, meeting.
Kach of these men asked for the votes
not only for himself, . but for the whole
ticket Â£rom top to bottom. Indeed, the
fight for the election of the entire ticket
has characterized the' labor campaign
from its inception, and last ' night . each
candidate hammered away with renewed
vigor. at the old strain; "vote for the
whole ticket. '-'. \u25a0--.'\u25a0: .. . .
Mayor Schmitz appeared a trifle .worn
by his flurried journey from hall to hall,
but he spoke with all of his old-time
vigor. He attributed much of the present
prosperity to hia administration, and as
sured the voters. that if he were elected
he would rule, for the good of the city
and for no class. â¢

JAMES DEVOTO
MEETS REBUKE
Election Commissioner Is
Grilled by Judge Sloss
for Unprofessional Conduct
KILGORE TO CAST VOTE
Effort of Board to Stop Him
by Switching View of
Law Rouses Ire of Court
Election Commissioner James Devoto
suffered a stinging rebuke at the hands of
Judge Sloss yesterday during the hearing
of the action instituted by Arthur M. Kil
gore to restrain the commission from
striking his name from the great j regis
ter. -, As Kilgore is not in sympathy jvith
the present administration, Devoto,' when
the case was called, took a stand dia
metrically opposed to v that assumed by
him when Perry H/ Newberry, represent
ing the Republican League, sought to
purge the register of hundreds of alleged
etuffers.
Devoto had hardly denned his position
yesterday when, to his great astonish
ment, Judge Sloss turned to him and
said: "You have no right to take one po
sition in one case and a directly opposite
position in another case involving the
same points, in an effort to win it. \u25a0 De
voto stammered that he and hjs col
leagues would do as the court wished, -a
fact that, was well known to everybody,
even though Devoto had withheld the
admission, as the wishes of a court are
generally obeyed in this State, even by
corrupt officials.
, Kilgore resides with his mother at 1007
Jackson â¢ etreet, and the Election Com
mission, after learning. that he is not a
friend: of the. administration, decided to
. cancel his registration on the ground that
his wife lives in Hay wards, where Kil
gore resided, up to last February. Kilgore,
however, stated that. he is permanently
residing with his mother, having left his
. Haywards place in order to' care for his
mpther'B interests in this city. It is well
known that he is a man of integrity, be
ing secretary . of the Russian Hill Im
provement Association, a graduate of Co
lumbia Law College and formerly a Judge
in Nevada.!, :
. After :the evidence, of Kilgore had been
taken.. yesterday Judge Sloss announced
that the only question he ; had Jurisdic
tion .to determine was the right ; of the
Election Commission to purge the regis
ter, and he announced that in his opinion
the commission had no such right except
in those cases -provided in the statutes,
when an elector had removed, been con
victed of a felony, found fobe insane or
had.died., .. , . '. ' -'.'\u25a0 h: . . '- : :
' The' only .'"remedy bf the! commission, he
said," was tO challenge Kilgore's vote at
the polls, and -then,'of: course, jKllgore
would have the right to swear in his vote,
the legality of which action could be.de-.
termined after the election In proper pro
ceeding., Judge Sloss ' then put the case
over until Friday, which means that the
commission -is without remedy to stay
the casting of the ballot by Kilgore if he
chooses to swear It in.
- Though Devoto contended during .,' the
hearing of the Newberry cases that ne
had no right to strike a name, from the
great register.' he had; the temerity to
admit yesterday that he had already
stricken Kilgore's name therefrom. He
was willing, though, he said, to waive
this fact and try the case on its merits.
As there were no "merits" on his side the
case was quickly decided in favor of Kil
gore, and with Devoto thoroughly im
pressed with the fact that the courts will
tolerate no jugglery with its processes.

NEW YORK ELECTION
SITUATION MIXED
'{ \ â \u2666â f
Party Lines Are Shattered in the Three-
Cornered Mayoralty Contest.
BE TTING STILL FA VORS McCLELLAN
Special. Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 4.â Jerome and
chaos â this describes the condition of
the municipal campaign as revealed by
The Call-Herald's secret canvass of
voters. The election of Jerome as Dis
trict Attorney seems to be reasonably
certain. The Mayoralty situation Is
confusing. The contest is between
Mayor McClellan and Hearst, with
Ivins third. An actual canvass of all
classes of voters shows a slight pre
ponderance of votes for Hearst. In
quiry also shows a strong trend for
McClellan among thÂ«; business element,
while a poll of election districts* places
McClellan In the lead. The 'outlook
,would seem to be such that the work
done at the polls on election day will
be the determining factor in the strug
gle. Indeed, the temper of the public Is
such that almost any result Is possible.
,The Call-Herald's canvass was taken
at random and is to be considered as a
strong surface Indication,* it being Im
possible to compare the' results ln.lo
ealities'wlth the balloting at previous
elections. * . . .
On the fnce of the return* Tammany
Hall has Rptrn split wide ojta. The
Republican party has been knocked to
pieces. 'There Is party chaos almost as
pronounced as that -which, on a larger
scale, engulfed the Democratic party in
1860. But the confusion extends to thÂ»
Republican party as well. There, is aa
uprising; against bosses and machines,
and it only remains to be seen whether
the. revolt. trill be far-reaching enough
to overthrow them both on election day.
â¢ It Is perfectly clear that Jerome Is
overwhelmingly the pre-election choice
of the citizens for District Attorney*
Barring the difficulties of the ballot, he
ought to receive more votes than" the
other two nominees combined. It Is
also shown that Tammany Is whipped
and that it can re-elect Mayor Mc-
Clellan only with the aid of Republican
and other votes which are not usually
cast under the Tammany emblems The
vote of union labor has been swept by
tens of thousands away -from the wig
wam; the support of streetcar em
ployes, of Iron workers, of mechanics,
of the printing trades, of plumbers, of
salesmen, of small salaried men, of la
borers has gone at the rate of 65 to 80
per cent. A surprisingly large number
of these voters have declared for the
Municipal Ownership, ticket.
It is not Tammany's vote alone that
shows an outspoken determination to
leave Its political home. The Repub
lican vote also Is deserting. Men in all
walks of life are declaring their Inten
tion of voting with Tammany. Others,
and they are quite as numerous, are
asserting that -they will have nothing
to do with either of the great political
parties and will support the Municipal
Ownership ticket.
This feeling. is rampant- all through.
In striking the final balance sheet the
vote cast for the nominees . for Mayor
the following result was obtained:
William It. Hearst. .'4477
George; B. McC1e11an. . ........... .3Â£83
William M. 1vin5. ...... \u0084. . ...... .2,333
.Voters in Manhattan 'and Bronx, com
priÃing New York County, were asked
to indicate their preference for District
Attorney, with the following result:
William Travers Jer0me. ........ : 3,634
James W.Osborne .1,138
Clarence J. Shearn 530
Charles A. F1amer ................ 105
McClellan closed favorite at 2% to 1,
and Jerome's chances 'lengthened to 10 to
7 in to-day's Wall-street betting. The
session on the Broad-street' curb was the
most active of the campaign. "It is esti
mated that fully JIOO.OOO was wagered In
the betting: ring. The bettors formed a
little market by themselves and continued
to offer odds until 1 o'clock.
At first McClellan opened a S to 1 fa
vorite, but the persistence with which
Hearst bettors offered their money drove
the odds back to 2%' to 1. For a period
there was every Indication that the. odds
â¢would shorten further on account of the
abundance of Hearst money, but this did
not occur. Tammany money rolled In and
the McClellan supporters finally closed
the odds at V& to L. --.v \u25a0
Practically all important wagers of the
day were on the ; result between Hearst
and McClellan. One of - the influences
which had an important- bearing on the
betting was the unfounded rumor that
The Call-Herald poll would indicate
Hearst's election. This report .was cur
rent on the Stock Exchange and soon
spread â¢\u25a0 throughout the financial district-
In the Jerome betting the odds of the
previous night did not last after 1 the first
half-hour. At noon the betting was 10
to 7 on Jerome.
SALT LAKE ELECTION.
Open Attack." IÂ« Made, on the Mormon
Element, Now Dominant; In City.
SALT LAKE CITY. Nov. 4.â The mu
nicipal campaign in Salt Lake has been
notable for an r open attack on the
Mormon ele^MÃit. dominant In both
municipal amHstate affairs. The Amer
ican ; party, organized previous to the
last general election, nominated a com
plete ticket, with Ezra Thompson for
Mayor, and made opposition to the so
called Mormon hierarchy the sole is
sue of Its campaign* The Democrats
renominated Mayor Richard P. Morris,
a Mormon, and the Republicans nom
inated for Mayor Chief of Police Wil
liam J. Lynch.; a Gentile. Up to to
night 'the Mormon leaders have made
no ' open expression of preference as
between Lynch" and; Morris. . In public
betting the odds favor Thompson or
Lynch as against Morris.

MRS. ARMSTRONG SAYS: I had been a
great sufferer for many years with catarrh and
diseased ears. I could stand the catarrh, but
the awful palna in my ears were at times al-
most unbearable. The pains, however, were
only a part of my ear trouble. I was at times
almost stone deaf and from both my ears th<srÂ«
was a constant discharge, tho odor of which
was most distressing. V. .
I kept myself poor paying doctor 'bills and
drug bills, and until - 1 : took tip the Electro-
Chemlc treatment nothing ever did me a bit of
good. - . ' .
I have taken a three raontha' Electro-Chernle
course. The first month's treatment cured all
pains. In two months' titna the discharge- from,
both ears was thoroughly : cured. -. and from the
Hart of the treatment my hearing gradually
returned and now I hear wel), my catarrh Is
;. cured. < all pain is gone, the awful -rinsing

four years Ago, when he took office, they
recoircized his strength of character and
his greatness of purpose, but were fearful
as to what the consequences might be In
the world. It Is because they have now
recognized that he is the possessor of su-_
perb honesty (applause), not only In pri
vate life, but In all public affairs, not only
in his dealing? with the people of the
United States, but In his dealings with
the. nations of the world. I think I may
be pardoned for dwelling upon the char
acter of Theodore Roosevelt, because it is
& proper and an appropriate introduction
to the subject, with which Â«c expect to
deal to-nlsht. In his recent tour through
the Southern States, no matter what
theme he might talk upon, there was run
ning: through his speech an appeal to the
citizens of the United States to throw
aside selfishness and self-seeking and to
work for the common good. In talking to
the students of Harvard a short time
ago he caid there never was a time in
the history of this nation when it was in
greater need of men among its leaders of
pfty Ideals, who tried to carry out those |
Jfleais and did not satisfy themselves by.
toerely talking about them. (Applause). )
APPEAL TO HONESTY.
"If ever there was a time when an ap
peal to the citizenship of this country to
put aside selfishness, to put aside self
Â«eeking. ever ought to fall upon willing
tars now Is the time, because we find
that throughout this broad country of
Burs men in high commercial life, the
presidents of our great insurance compa
nies, have been untrue to their trust and,
folding positions of honor, have used the
money of the widows" and orphans in
Sealing for themselves and their own
benefit.

"Parties are organized for the pur
pose oS putting into operation in the
carrying on of government certain
jrinciples upon which the members of
.hat party have agreed. It is next to
mpoesible for us all to agree upon all
:he principles that we desire to have
put into operation in the carrying on
>f the g-overnment, but we rind that a
arge number of us can agree upon a
lumber of important principles, and
mother large number have be.en able to
igree upon certain other principles
vhich they want to have put into oper
ition, and thus parties are organized.
(Vnd when a man is nominated for a
public office by one of these parties he
:s supposed to represent tlfose prin
ciples, and in voting for him you are
?upposed to vote to "put those prin
ciples into operation in carrying on

TO STAMP OUT GRAFT.
"Whenever it appears that the man's
nomination has been procured by cor
rupt practices, or whenever it appears
that the man himself is corrupt, he no
longer represents the principles which
led you -to become a member of that
party: he becomes simply a personality
and he is the representative of nothing
but corruption and graft. Under those
circumstances it not only becomes the
duty of every member of that party not
to vote for him, but it becomes the duty
of every patriotic citizen to let patriot
ism rise above party fealty, above'par
tisan unionism and to vote for the good
of his country and to stamp out graft
and corruption.
"2\o citizen of a republic can afford
to disregard interference with tho
rights of other citizens. If Hampden
had consulted his own personal com
fort and paid the 7 shillings of ship
money the Stewarts might -still have
reigned and constitutional liberty have
been a stranger to England. If Thomas
Jefferson had been content to settle his
stamp tax and if John Adams had been
satisfied to drink his tea in peace the
flag of our country might never have
fluttered in the breeze. And selfish in
difference of citizenship may still lead
to the possibility of the dissolution of
this republic.
"Honor Is the breath of a kingdom,
but virtue is the very lifeblood of a
republic (Aside â This is harder work
than prosecutng a United States Sena

**I want to Â»:iy a few word* about

DECENCIES CHAMPION.
"The issue here to-night is not
Sehmitz or Partridgeâ that gallant
young laborer who has worked ' since
he was 15 years of age, and who has
not yet accumulated more than enough
to live as every decent citizen of tte
United States hopes and expects to al
ways live â I say it is not the Issue be
tween Scbmitz and Partridge, but it is
the issue between Abraham Ruef and
the decent, honest element of the city
of San Francisco. And, after all, that
issue is not entirely local. If we look
to Philadelphia we see that the decent
clement there Is nghting under tht*
leadership of Mayor Weaver to down
the gratters. If we look to Xew York
City we find William Travers Jerome
running for District Attorney against
all the combined Indecency of all the
indecent bosses. If we lookV to St.
lxmis we find that Governor Folk has
fought boodling and graft to a stand
still. And when we come to our own
beautiful city we find that Ruef asks
the auestion. -here Is the proof that
any boodling or grafting: is going on?
"I want to apeak a* an expert on that
subject. 1 say that there are more bunko
Mtevrrrm and more thieves In San Fran
Â«'isro to-day than there ever were before
la the history of tbe* city <applause),
and every one of them to-nUcht Js oat
bowiloff for Senmlt* for Mayor. It Is
circumstantial evidence, I will admi/,
bat circumstantial evidence Is the best
kind of evidence when you have enoncb
of it. They Un%e not been Indicted, and
therefore their claim la there Is no
sraftinfr or boodliuff.
"Was Chris Buckley indicted before
he was driven out of bis stronghold by
the election of the decent element in
this city? Does anybody doubt that he
acquired his money by grafting? Was
Richard Croker indicted in New York?
Does anybody doubt that he acquired
his great wealth by grafting.
SIGNS POINT TO RUEF.
"Has the boss Derham of Philadel
phia been Indicted yet? Does anybody
doubt that immense grafting steals
were going: on there of which he was
the leader? I say to you that all signs
In San Francisco point to Abraham
Ruef as being the power behind the
throne, the man who is taking in the
money. ?-.*'\u25a0 vi:
**1 Â»ay to you, moreover, thai I per
sonally know Hint Abraliam Ruef Is
corrupt- And 1 any to you Hint when
ever lie wanta me to prove it In court
I vrlll do so. I suy to you further that
If Sehmltr. la re-elected Maynr-for an
other two yeurw grafting- will become
so bad, owluk *o the renewed courage
they will have, that the people of the
city of San Francisco will send for nit,
In whatever pjrt of the United States
I am, and bee >Â»ie to come back here
and put Ruef In the penitentiary, where
he belong*. :~V^"-"_
"I say to you that when I went to
the State of Oregon they told me it was
impossible to convict United States
Senator John H. Mitchell because he
had been the political boss for forty
years and was Intrenched behind all
the corruption that can be built up In
that time. But I convicted him with a
jury of Oregon citizens, and I am glad
to say that I found the standard of
citizenship in Oregon as high as It is
in any part of the United States.
"As compared with the task which I
undertook there, anion; a people to
whom I was a Mrnnsrer, the convicting
of Ahe Rnef for kml lint; In San Fran
cisco would be an easy task. I will
eunrantee that If I take charge of a
Grand Jury In this city it will return
indictmentH aeainst Rnef for grafting
Inside of a week. And I now here to
nlffht pledge myself to the citizens of
San Francisco that if Schmitz Is re
elected and this crafting; continues I
will devote my best energies Â« o sending
Abe Ruef to the penitentiary.
TO VOTE A DUTY.
"You would give your life to protect
your personal honor, but we only ask you
to give your vote to protect the honor of
your own city. No man can serve two
masters. Every man in the city of San
Francisco has a duty to perform, on next
Tuesday. It is his duty to vote for good
government, and the man who stays away
from the polls on that flay is not only a
traitor to his duty, but a traitor to civil
ization itself. The decent people 'are
largely in the majority in every city and
in every hamlet in the United States. All
they need to do is to go to the "polls and
vote and there will be no question about
the result.
"In my opinion, instead of being elected
by a paltry 1000 majority, John S. Part
ridge and the rest of this ticket is going
to be elected by 15,000 majority, and I will
tell you why. It is conceded by every one
who pays any attention to such matters
that the distinctive labor vote numbers
about 16,000, and no more. It in conceded
by every one who knows anything about
the subject that out of thÂ« 12,500 Demo
cratic votes that went to Franklin K.
Lane, Sehmitz cannot hope to get at this
time more than one-half thereof. I do not
believe he will get any. If you add one
half of the 16,000, making 22,000, and throw
in 3,000 more that come from behind the
red lights, making 25,000, you will reach
about the top limit that Sehmitz can hope
or expect to get, and you know how many
more are left.
IS RUEF LABOR'S CHAMPION*
"1 have heard quite a number of men
who belong to labor unions say that they
were going to vote for Sehmitz because
he represented labor unions. I wan to say
to these men that they are entirely mis
taken in their facts. 1 would like to know
by what process of reasoning it can be
determined that Sehmitz represents the
labor unions? By what God-given power
did Abe Ruef ever secure the right to
name the nominees for the Union Labor
men? But let me say more. There is no
issue now between labor^nd capital, and
there ought never to be any.
"The great national leaders of the
labor unions and of the labor people,
Samuel Gompurs and John Mitchell,
have botl^ declared that, in thefr opin
ion, the labor unions should keep en
tirely out of politics. And it must be
apparent to any thinking man that that
must be true. What principle can un
derlie the organization of a party that
is composed only of men who labor with
their hands? Does the .fact that Mr.
Sehmitz used to pull the bow across the
fiddle make him any more of a laborer
than it does the man who, with a little
/more brains, can write the music that
he plays? Or does it mafic Mr. Sehmitz
any more of a laborer than is John S.
Partridge, who commenced to work
when* lie was 15 years of age, who has
supported a family ever since, who put
himself through college by writing for
newspapers and by his brains,
and who has been working for wages
and for fees ever sinee â and working
from sixteen to nineteeA hours a
day? There was nobody to make any
law for him that would limit his work
to eight hours a day and make it suc
cessful.
"Do not take it, ladies and gentlemen,
that that means I am not the friend of
organized labor or that I do not believe
in unionism, because 1 do. I believe in
organised labor, but I do not believe
that organized labor has any more right
to violate the law than has an organ
ized trust. And the man who could ap
peal to organized labor and ask for
its .vote upon the promise that if
elected he will, if necessary/violate his
oath of office and aid it in break-
Ing the law is unfit to be elected to any
office within the gift of the American
people. He is ia traitor to the repub
lic, he is a traitor to this civilization,
he is a traitor to everything . that is
right and decent", to every principle that
we admire and that we all look up to. \
PLEA FOR BRANDENSTEIN.
"I want to thank you all for the, kind
attention that you have given, and with
the expression of one other idea I will
close.
"What difference does it make whom
we elect Mayor and whom we elect Dis
trict Attorney? My experience has been
that there are thousands of men in public
life who possess what I . term negative
honestyâ that is to r say, they would not
steal anything : themselves, but * they are
liable to wink when the other fellow is
stealing, and ' fail to see it. On j the 'other
hand, there are in public life a few men
who possess what I term aggressive hon-
THE: SAN. FRAN CISOUL^^
esty. Theodore Roosevelt is one "of that
stamp, and as the result thereof you iind
the grafters being driven out of every
department of the public service.
"Now, If Scbmltz Is honest he Is only
negrntively honest/ to May the least) but
In John S. Partridge we offer you a man
who possesses aggressive honesty.
"I am willing to-night to say that I am
personally acquainted with 90 per cent of
this fusion ticket, and I have no hesitancy
In indorsing that 90 per cent as each and
all possessing aggressive honesty. Most
of them have been tried for from four to
seven years in the public service, and you
know them. \u25a0 i
"Among them is a man named H. U.
Brandensteln, who is nominated for Dis
trict Attorney. My experience teaches me
that with an honest District Attorney
and an honest Judge all the grafters in
any city or State can be driven out, re
gardless of whether the other officials are
honest or not. An aggressively honest
District Attorney can make all of ahe
negative honest fellows keep honest as
long as they are in office, and those who
are not honest he can send across the
bay.
CROOKS WILL BE SENT UP.
"If H. U. Brandensteln is elected Dis
trict Attorney and John S. Partridge is
elected Mayor of your city I guarantee
that all the crooks who are now in office
will be removed from the boards and po
sitions that they now cocupy, and that
those who are overlooked will find them
selves on the way to San Quentin or Fol
som before Brandenstein gets through
with them.
"What need to ask you whether you
want to change\your Board of Supervisors
or not? You have tried them in the fire
and they have not' been found wanting.
"Just one word more. I have heard
people say, 'What is the use of trying to
stop graftâ you cannot stop it? As soon
as you have stopped it in one place it
commences in another.' Now, I am not
one of those Ideal reformers who believe
that graft can be stamped out absolutely
or that the world can be made a paradise
In a day or in a hundred years. But
graft is" just like every other vice. If
permitted to grow it continues to grow,
and it gains by accretions, just as a snow
ball rolling down hill becomes so large
that it is an avalanche and sweeps every
thing in its path.
' "On the other hand graft and vice
of all kinds can be controlled within
reasonable limits and I know of no
better illustration than that of the
electric car which we experience by
riding in every day. When we Start
dov&i one of these hills the brakeman
turns on the brake at the foot of each
hill before he comes to the cross track,
brings the car to a dead stop, and then
starts up again. You all know that
if that car were permitted to run
down three or four of those blocks
without the brake being put on at all
it would run away and destroy itself
by jumping the track and being
.smashed to pieces. Just so is this re
public in so far as graft Is concerned.
By a few honest men here and there
who are aggressively honest, earnest
ly endeavoring to stop graft and put
ting a few of the grafters in the peni
tentiary, the example is sufficient to
bring the car to a dead stop, and it has
to start all over again; by keeping at
it you will stop it again before it gets
to the foot of the next hill and by.
keeping at it you will stop it again
before it gets to the foot of the next
hill, and in that way, you will land
your passengers in the car barn in
safety or at their homes, or wherever
they are going.
MUST PUT ON BRAKES.
"Now that is what we must do with
this great republic of ours. It is rush
ing down through the ages at a pace
that requires us to watch the machin
ery, and at every crossing we should
get out, sound the wheels wit ha tam
pering hammer and make sure .of what
we are doing; otherwise we are bound
to meet with destruction because,
without virtue, a republic cannot ex
ist. - â¢ > -.
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have talked
as long as it is possible for me to talk
under" the 'circumstances. I have not
said half that I would like to say, but I
suppose that I have said almost all that
you care to hear from one man to-night,
and so I will quit while you sstlll are
hungry. If you say 'No,' and feel that,
I will be moie welcome another time.
"Now, in conclusion, I only want to say
this: We hear a great deal about the
rights and privileges of men, and we
hear altogether too little about the civic
duties of man. I wish that the grammar
schools of this country had a course in
which they instructed the youths in their
civic duties, in their duties as citizens, in
which they were taught that this Indiffer
ence to everything which does not seem
to afffict us individually Is all wrong.
Is there not too much of that sort of
statesmanship which says 'After me, the
deluge'? Is there not among us too much
of the philosophy of the Arizona gambler
who says, 'I make it a rule never to care
what happens as long as it does not hap
pen to me'? " PJvery citizen owes it to
posterity to do all in his power to hand
down the liberties which -we possess, to
our children, and our children's children,
and on next Tuesday I beg of you to go
to the polls and vote for civic righteous
ness, decency and honesty In this our be
loved city." * -
, Henry U. Brandenstein, candidate for
District Attorney, was one of the last
speakers of /the evening," yet the vast
audience was waiting for him and he re
ceived a splendid ovation. He cut his re
marks down as short as possible, saying
he knew the voters wanted, to hear Part

Frank Gould got a fitting reception
when he commenced his argument. , He
tc voted most of his time to tearing into
chmltz and Ruef and showing how the
present government had hindered San
Francisco in every way that would be of
benefit to her. In part he said:
The Republican and Democrats have fought
many a hard battle in bygone daya. The Re
publicans have generally beaten us, but we
have always come back fighting and were al
ways willing to do battle over again. Now
we are united In the cause of decency and we
("will forget about the past in an endeavor to
rid the city of the grafters. This time the
ltJ to 1 policy will mean that sixteen citi
zens to every one will vote for Partridge and
help snow thi 1 grafters" under. AYe have dis
agreed on tariff in the past, but now we agreÂ«!
that the tariff 'that harbors ' vice should be
abolished.
Outsiders will tell you we have a magni
ficent city, but the -worst government in the
United States. That is an awful, etate of af
fairs and keeps the decent Easterner away
from us. We are talking about nothing but
graft in this campaign for the very reason
there is nothing else for us to talk about.
DODGE PRODUCES ..FIGURES.
Assessor Washington Dodge devoted
most of his time to showing by means of
charts how San Francisco is being rap
idly outstripped in the matter of improve
ments and growth* by Los Angeles and
Seattle. Dr. Dodge gave out the same
figures as were printed the other day re
garding the comparatively small advances
being made here. He | blamed it all on
the present administration and said that
we would soon be actually overtaken in
population by our rivals unless the forces
of decency bhould manage to get control
of the government and run me city as it
should be run.
Charles A: Sweigert, one of the nom
inees for Supervisor, made the witty ad
dress of the evening: and at once won
for himself a favored place In the hearts
of his listeners by the clever and well
adapted remarks he handed out. He said
Ruef and Schmltz were cleaning up
everything In sight. He said Ruef had
taken the rumps of the Republican and
Democratic parties and had produced a
tenedrloin party of his own. He said
they were posing as unionists, but >-ere
the rankest kind of confederates, and
ttiat San P'rancisco was sleeping the sleep
of industrial peace under the present ad
ministration.
Partridge was cheered to the echo when
he was presented as the last speaker by
Chairman Wait: The crowd rose^ in a
body and it was several minutes before
the speaker could manage to make ready
to deliver, his address. He spoke as lol

"The long night is nearly over, and

HAVE .MOVED AWAY
Postmaster -.Returns to Reg
istrar 14,272 Sample Bal
lots Mailed to Voters.
There were 11.272 envelopes con
taining . official . sample ballots g ad
dressed to registered voters returned
to the Registrar by the Postmaster,
with the information that the persons
do not live at the residences designated
in the addresses. The. numbers re
turned^vs having- moved from. the vari
ous assembly districts follow:
Twenty-eighth, 1030; Twenty-ninth,
110S; Thirtieth, 785; Thirty-first, 821:
Thirty-second, Thirty-third, 402;
Thirty-fourth, 588; Thirty-fifth, 730;
Thirty-sixth, 524: Thirty-seventh, 899;
Thirty-eighth, 927; -Thirty-ninth. 563;
Fortieth, 457; Forty-first. 379: Forty
second, 1340; Forty-third, '1148; Forty
fourth, -1248: Forty-fifth, 303.
Unless some of the voters whose bal
lots were -returned have moved within
the limits of their precinct^ it will re
sult in reducing the total registration
of 97,792 by 14,272, making the net
registration only 83.520.
The highest number of envelopes re
turned are from the Twenty-eighth,
Twenty-ninth, Forty-second, Forty
third and Forty-fourth districts, the
last three having many boarding
houses therein, which may account for
the great number not living at. their
former address. A number of .voters
have died since registration 'began In
January, 1904.V-. which would also help
account for tfhe apparent great reduc
tion in the j registration.

SAN FRANCISCO. Cal., October 30, 1903.
At a meeting of members of the Bar of this city, held this day. It was
unanimously resoLved that \u25a0 publicity should be. given to the following state
mentiby the undersigned: -
.Believing that it is our special duty to aid every citizen to a -wiso
selection of law officers, we earnestly submit the following reasons for our
choice tor the office of District Attorney:
, The duties of the office, generally, are to prevent crime as well as to
punish criminals, and an able, fearless. and honest District Attorney will
work as much prevention as punishment: for the certainty of punishment is
the '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 surest " means to prevent crime, as ha 3 been notably demonstrated by
the splendid - work of Governor Folk of Missouri, and Mr. Jerome of New
York, who -earned national reputations as District Attorneys. ..
. ..While the" general duty of our District Attorney is to purge this city of
crime, it must be borne in mind: â¢
-First, that he appoints seven assistants, four of whom have entire
charge of police court prosecution: .- \u25a0Â». . .- â¢
- Second, he appoints four assistants who. control the issuance of warrants
and the fixing of* bail, and who handle over- $300,000.00 yearly in bail money.
-..-\u25a0 Third.-. he acts as legal adviser* to. the Grand Jury, the Police Department,
the Health Department and the Coroner.-^Â£g*a*iÂ»sSÂ£RiÂ«*9P*s
â¢ Fourth, it Is his duty to draw informations and indictments.
8 ;: Fifth. ' in a word, it depends on his ability, honesty and firmness whether
crime shall be lessened in the city. IFlnbUiOL ijlÂ»liHij|H' iPTIOrPi)
--;. - Inasmuch sts the criminal. law Is full of fine points.., and criminals . are
defended *by shrewd and . able counsel, no' District ; Attorney can perform hi?*
duties iriprhtly unless;he has had a large experience in the law. Mr. Langdon's
experience : Is as -a. : teacher, not ; as a lawyer. Jir. Brandensteln has been for
many .years past In.theactive practice; of the law. and his record in the Board
of i Supervisors'; has proven his ability, courage. and -persistence -in successfully
fighting fraudulent .schemes, no matter how rich or powerful their promotors.
- "We believe that'in'all qualities necessary for the veryimportant'offlce of
District. Attorney, ,the = administration of which must depend on one man, Mr.
Krandenstein is; pre-eminently -fitted and therefore earnestly recommend him
to the voters of San Francisco. \

SOUTHERN TEAM PROVES
NO MATCH FOR CARDINAL
Blue and Gold Players
Fail to Show High
Class Form.
Defeat Nevada Handily
but Style on Field
Is Not Good. .
University of California's football
victory over Nevada yesterday was a
foregone conclusion, but the score. 16
to 0, brougrht no especial joy to the
hearts of the rooters in the gTand
st&nd. who gathered in goodly num
bers. The varsity men played ragged
ball and apparently had slumped from
the high standard shown In their con
test with the Sherman Indians and
with the Oregon Agricultural College.
The only solace the rooters could sug
gest was that 'Perhaps it Is all a
blind to fool the cardinal and give a
false line 011 the condition of the team."
Fumbles were plentiful by the Cali
fornia men. Snedigar, Siern and Mead
were us prominent offenders in this
way as any of the freshmen who were
utilized in the game.
Assistant Coach Griffin issued the or
ders that cent three sets or players
into the game for California. First,
he used the team with the varsity suo
ttitute banks, and SchafCer at quarter.
Later he put In the varsity back field
and had Whitman run the team. Stow
taking Force's place at tackle. Last
ly, the freshmen backs were utiHzsd
with two substitute ends.
Nevada made an indifferent showing,
with the exception of Captain Masjee.
He did the punting and made the only
gains that were Vaade for his team. He
was injured in the second half and had
to be taken out. He returned soon
when it was seen the team was help
less without him.
California made a touchdown in the
tiret half just as time was called.
Force failed to kick the goal.
Nevada got the ball early in the sec
\u25a0ond half and Magee tried for a place
kick for goal on the thirty-yard line,
but failed. Then it was easy for Cali
fornia. The little Nevada men went
i*~ over repeatedly as the heavy California
chaps bucked the line. In ten downs
California made eighty yards, and
Snedigar finally carried the ball over
on a twelve-yard end run for a touch
down. He kicked a goal and the score
was 11 to 0. The second touchdown
\u25a0was made easily, but Snedigar failed to
kick the goal. Score. 16 to 0. - The
line-up follows:
Nevada â Stanwick, right end; Mor
ton, right tackle; Henry Coffin, right
guard; Hamilton, center; Jones, left
guard; Freeman, left tackle; Westall,
left end; Davis, right half; Hart, left
half; Huseman, Henry, full: Magee

STANFORD AND CALIFORNIA ELEVENS ARE VICTORIOUS
Outclassed . in Every
Way Throughout
Entire Game.
Vandervodrt Is Hero of
a Daring Seventy-
Yard Sprint.
PARK WINSLOW
Stanford, accumulated sixteen points
against the University of Southern Cal
ifornia football team at Palo Alto yes
terday in forty-flve minutes of "play.
The youths from the citrus belt did not
even threaten to score. One touchdown
was made in the first half and two In
the second. It was the result of bad
Judgment and a series of accidents that
the score was not twice as large.
The Lanagans outclassed their oppo
nents in every feature of the game.
The southerners had charge of the pig
skin only for a few. brief periods, in
which next to nothing was accom
plished. The most spectacular feature
of the contest was a splendid run of
seventy yards by Vandervoort. It hap
pened toward tne close of the second
half. The cardinal had made its second
touchdown. The visitors Kicked off to
Stanford's five-yard line. Vandervoort
drew the ball down out of the air and
Bhot across the field on the home trip.
Half a dozen men tackled him and were
left in the dust. Almost within reach
of the goal line and a score a yellow
haired boy from the orange groves laid
him low.
When the home team had succeeded
in making only one touchdown after
twenty-five minutes of play the Stan
ford adherents felt pretty blue, but by
the end of the game their spirits had
been raised appreciably.
VISITORS' LINK IS WEAK.
The visitors kicked off at the start.
Stanford worked the ball through the
opposing line for a touchdown after
losing the pigskin but once. â¢ The
southerners were weak at all points in
the line and the cardinal players were
good for a gain at every turn. Chal
mers secured the touchdown and Craw
ford failed to kick the goal.
During the remainder of the half
Stanford clearly showed her superior
ity, but lost ground through bad judg
ment on the part of the quarterback.
Stott at one time tried a quarterback
run when the required five yards' de
tour carried him OjUtside. Three other
times during the game he tried the play
for serious losses and once for a twen
ty-yard gain.
In the second half Stanford lost the
ball carelessly twice when within. easy
scoring distance. Finally the cardinal
team rallied and pushed straight along
through more than half the field and
Slusher was sent across the goal line
for a touchdown. Crawford again
failed to kick an easy goal after the
ball had been punted out. On the next
kick-off Vandervoort made his long
run. On the second succeeding play
Horton won a touchdown and Fenton
kicked the goal. . . .
KXIBBS WATCHES GASIE.
Knibbs, the California coach, went
down to see the game. He was not able
to get much, of a line on the Stanford
team in view of the fact that Lana
gan's men tried no new plays and did
not have an opportunity to show what
they could do on the defensive. The
favorite play of the cardinal is a slight
modification of Woodruff's old f "guards
back" with one man missing., as neces
sitated by the new rules. If Coach
Knibbs tells Bush and Force to play
farther out next Saturday that tackle
play will be stopped with disaster to
the cardinal. One year Hare, and Mc-
Cracken plowed through Harvard so
hard that it looked like cruelty to let
the game continue. The next year Har
vard drew out her tackles, Yale style,
and "guards back" went away back to
the woods.
Slusher played a rattling fullback for
Stanford yesterday and If he does not
commence the big game he will prove a
worthy substitute. Molflno and Van
dervoort did splendidly at center and
half respectively. Stott did well at
quarter except when he showed bad
judgment in giving the signals.
Captain Chalmers made a substantial
gain every time he got the ball. He Is
one of the best In the business and if
every Stanford man were a Chalmers
Coach Knibbs would soon be looking
up and down the street for a sign "Boy
wanted." The biggest part of Stan
ford's line needs more muscle and more
experience. For the visitors C. A.

play.a bit of ball now, and the Tigers are
not here any. more. Uncle's brigade did
.not' have to work hard yesterday to grab
three runs, and' those three carried them
through handily. ; : : "-
Slivers Henley mounted the slab for the
first time in weeks, . and did well. It was
the great work of Georgte Htldebrand out
in the left ' garden that helped Henley
stow the Tigers away. . Hllde : had five
chances, and none' of them looked easy at
that. He wound up the game by. hooking
two which would surely have tied up the
score. ; ';"-â¢:_\u25a0 :â¢,â¢:\u25a0\u25a0- --' \u25a0â¢. â¢'"-;'â¢â¢â¢;\u25a0'
Gochnauer made the first mistake of the
same in the ninth by booting one from
Mclaughlin's bat. Mike Lynch landed on
one and it made a noise like a three
bagger. Away it soared toward the left
field fence, ".but Hllde did an aerial plunge
and speared it with one mitt. Rlghfback
came Casey with a low, rakish one, and
again the fleet little left fielder got after
the ball and grabbed it .going at a full

The score was one all in the sixth, when
Hlldebrand led oft with a double to cen

IT IS A DEEP-SEATED BLOOD DISGI3DER
Catarrli is not merely a stubborn or protracted "] cold, as some people' seem to think, but
it is a deep-seated and dangerous blood disorder, more generally affecting the body than any
other disease. Hardly any part is exempt from the trouble; it attacks the .head, throat,
stomach, bowels, kidneys, bladder, lungs and other members, and its effects often break
down and completely ; undermine, the health. J"*6^; :^ &{ . v
Like all blood diseases, Catarrh comes from poisons and impurities accumulating in the
blood.- The refuse matter of the body, which should be expelled as nature intends, is left
in; the system because of a sluggish condition of the different parts. Then 'the blood, as it
circulates through the body, collects and absorbs the foul matter, becoming polluted and

FOR ACCOUNTING
â¢ Seattle Man Alleges That He
Is Entitled to Share in
Profits of Power .Company
ACCUSES HIS BROTHER
Declares That Relative Is
Trying to Keep Him From
Securing His Just Rights
CHICAGO, Nov. 4.â Charles H. Baker of
Seattle. Wash., filed a bill in the United
States Circuit Court here this afternoon
for an Injunction to restrain the transfer
of any of the stock or securities of the
Snoqualmie Falls and While River Power
Company of the State of Washington.
Baker, who claims a half-interest in the
plant, said to be worth millions, alleges
la his bill that he received only $465.
Baker 3b the son of William T. Baker.
now dead, former millionaire financier and
Btcek broker of Chicago. The latter fur
nished the money and the complainant,
the bill avers, the skill and brains for the
development of the plant. The complain
ant alleges that because of the relations
naturally easting between fainer and
ton no contract was ever reduced to writ
ing. However, the bill says, a verbal
agreement was made, the father agreeing
to furnish the money if the son would
develop the power plant, each to enjoy
half the profits. Howard W. Baker,
brother cf the complainant. Is ad
ministrator of the estate of the father,
and. It is charged, by alleged manipula
tion of more than $2,000,000 worth of stock
In the power plant has arranged matters
so the complainant cannot get what he
claims is his; that all he received was
ihe $465.
The complainant was a civil engineer,
but without means, according to the story
pet up in the bill. He discovered in ISS7
the possibilities of taking power from
certain water falls in the State of Wash
ington and furnishing electrical power to
surrour.ding cities. He worked over his
plan for ten years. When he discovered
the groat power sources in the Snoqual
mie Falls, in which he interested his
father, the verbal agreement was then
made. Baker declares that in developing
the water power plant at the falls and
making other vast improvements money
was being realized, bur still his father
had failed to draw the contracts. On
October 6, 1903. the father died. Baker
now alleges that his brother was made
administrator of tne estate ar.d refuses to
recognize his half-Interest in the company
a? it now stands.
Baker also alleges that his brother has
transferred the stock to the X. W. Harris
Company and N'orval H. La timer, repre
senting Dexter, Horton & Co. This stock
is valued at $2.451.j95. The stock is said
to be now in the control of the Commer
cial Trust Company. Baker alleges that
he turned back into the company all but
$IGj. This, he declares, was his only com
pensation outside of necessary expenses
in almost twenty years of work in devel
oping the plants. \ ,

Joseph 11. Call of California
Discusses Railroad Legis
lation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. N*ov. 4.â Joseph H. Call
of California, a member of the commis
sion appointed at the recent Interstate
Commerce Law Convention in Chicago,
called at the White House to-day. The
entire commission will shortly make ' a
rail upon the President to present him
with the resolutions that were adopted.
Call told the President that the commis
sion was a strongly representative body
and that it was unanimous on the propo
sition that the only way to regulate the
railroads was to empower the Interstate
Commerce Commission, or some adminis
trative body, to fix reasonable rates. The
convention was convinced, he said, that
the courts could not handle the matter
except on an appeal from a decision of the
commission.
"The sentiment .of the country unquali
fiedly indorses the efforts of the President
to secure a remedy for the present evils,"
declared Call. "I believe the President's
plan is one that not only will reduce the.
oppression that is now imposed upon the
people, but will protect the Interests of
the railroads as well. If action on this
question is postponed by Congress it will
continue to be an issue before the people
of the country . until Senators are elected
\u25a0who will <5o what the people want."
