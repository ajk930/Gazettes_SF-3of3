. BERLIN. Feb. 22.-The debate which

-. regarding the police surveillance of
Russian students in Germany was re-
Fumed to-day in the Prussian Diet, and
. the Prussian Minister of Justice, Dr.
Schoenstedt. and the Prussian Minister
Of the Interior. Freiherr von Hammer-
Etein, went at length into the allega
tions made in the Reichstag by Herr
Haas (Social Democrat), Herr Bebel,
â¢ the Socialist leader in the Reichstag,
and. others. The Ministers explained
the action of the Government in this
matter so satisfactorily that they won !
the approval of the opposition speak- !
trs.
pr. Schoenstedt gave a full statement !
<*f the reasons for the arrest of a num- I
ber of Socialists at Koenigsburg, which '
had aroused such bitter denunciations â 
from the Socialist speakers in the
; Reichstag. He said the state attorneys !
of East Prussia had long been aware i
cf the existence of a system of smug- i
pUng undesirable literature into Rus- '
siaÂ» and an examination had resulted |
in tae finding of extensive deposits of i
these pamphlets hidden in various bor
der towns. They succeeded in securing
".a number of these documents, most of \
which had been prepared in Switzer- ;
land and translated into Russian and j
Lithuanian. Translations into German j
. showed that many of these pamphlets j
were of a treasonable and anarchistic '
""character.
Dr. Schoenstedt read a passage from â 
one document which expressly advo
' cated murder, and quoted the following
phrase :
"I prefer, however, that Nicholas II
,Â«hould not die by a bullet, but rather
be reserved for the scaffold."
A search of houses where this litera
ture was found brought out the fact
that twelve to thirteen persons engaged
In the smuggling were all Social Dem
ocrats, and correspondence was seized j
â which points very strongly to the as
eumption that they were* acting under
orders of the party managers.
Freiherr von Hammerstein. in his
address, referred to a small book that
had been seized, which gave minute
directions for the organizing of mur
derous plots.
After the Minister of the Interior
concluded a few short addresses were
made aod every one expressed satis
faction with the Government's state
ment. One speaker regretted that these
explanations were not given in the
Reichsatg at once so that the force of
the Socialist charges there might have
been broken.

Army Movements
of Japanese
in Korea.
- LONDON, Feb. 23.â Indefinite reports
of the movements of troops in the vi
cinity of the Talu River and state
ments of attempts to cut the Siberian
Railroad are published this morning.
The Weihaiwei correspondent of the
Times describes a visit to Chemulpo,
Korea, on February 19, and the Japan
ese landing operations there, which, he
says, demonstrated that the Japanese
military organization is superior to
that of any European power. A gen
eral Japanese advance along the
Peking road to Plngyang, Korea, the
correspondent continues, is expected
shortly. The original plan was to land
at Masampho, but the naval successes
enabled the Japanese to, begin opera
tions at Chemulpo and a further
change of base to Chlnnampho is high
ly probable. As soon as the ice breaks
up troops .will be established at Ping
yang In sufficient strength to guard
against a sudden Russian descent. It
Is believed that while the sea power of
Russia at Vladivostok is intact the
Japanese will not attempt to land on
the eastern coast of Korea. As an evi
dence of Japan's intention, it Is worthy
of note that her cruisers are busy pa
trolling toward the northwest of Korea
and that she is not landing artillery at
Chemulpo.
Everything suggests an Immediate
dash for a strategic position in North
ern Korea, the c6rrespondent con
cludes, and It Is possible the-Russians
are considerably farther south than is
supposed. *

that the report of the Telegraph's

Is the reason why such pains have
I been taken of late to obtain the good
will of Austria. Germany very proba
bly will be willing to further Russia's
plan, being glad enough to find there
by a means of realizing her well
known ambitions in Asia Minor and
let Russia weaken herself in fighting
in the Far East.
Russia knows all this, but is never
theless determined to get her ships
through, even if it is necessary to
adopt the subterfuge of altering their
appearance, disguising them as mer
chantmen.
The Porte is almost willing, and If
England makes any objection to the
passage it will be the signal for an
immediate advance toward India.

owners four ships, which sail from
Black Sea ports with cargoes of coal.
Very high terms were given and in
case o( capture the Government will
pay the full value of the vessels.
. Admiral Alexieff's retirement to
Harbin with his staff is interpreted to
mean that he is convinced the Japan
ese will besiege Port Arthur, where,
as at Vladivostok also, supplies are
far from plentiful.
The order of the day is that Japan
will be. allowed to occupy Korea. The
fleet has received instructions not to
engage in any fight at present, but to
remain on the defensive until the be
ginning of July, when half of the en
tire Baltic fleet will be dispatched to
the Far East. It is hoped also that
by that time part of the Black Sea

of the Disaster.
ASTORIA. Or., Feb. 22.â The Ameri
can schooner F. .W. Howe, owned at
Boston. Mass., and on her way from
Ballard, Wash., to San Pedro with a
cargo of railroad ties, went ashore at
Seaview, Wash., a point on Long
Beach ten miles north of Cape Disap
pointment, this morning. She now Ile3
in the breakers, with a heavy sea
pounding her to pieces. Three lives
were lost in the disaster to the little
vessel and several of her crew were In
jured.
The Howe was sighted shortly after
10 o'clock this morning by the observer
at the North Head Lighthouse flyin?
signals of distress. About an hour
later she had drifted northward and
struck on the beach at Seaview. As
the craft hit the breakers she wa3
forced around and struck the beach
stern first.
The life saving crews at Point
Adams. Cape Disappointment and
North Beach went to the scene as
quickly as possible. Three lines were
shot toward the distressed vessel, but
none of them reached her. A lifeboat
was then launched, which, after con
siderable difficulty, reached the dis
tressed craft and took off her master,
Captain Keegan, and six of the crew.
Before' the vessel struck on the beach
two of the crew were killed. A Nor
wegian sailor, whose name c6\ild not
be learned, fell from the rigging and
was killed, "and shortly afterward "Wil
liam Vansanter, the cook, while taking
his turn at the wheel, was struck by
a heavy sea, which hurled him across
the deck against the rigging, killing
him instantly. Captain Keegan said:
"We left Ballard on February 12. and
all went well until the afternoon cf
Thursday last. We were then off Ya
quina Bay. About 1:20 o'clock in the
afternoon we suddenly filled. A strong
southwest gale was blowing at the
time and the seas were rolling moun
tain high. Since then the schooner has
been waterlogged and all that kept her
afloat was the cargo In her hold. We
have lived in the rigging and on the
deck since that time. Realizing our
desperate condition, I determined to
reach the Columbia River or Cape Flat
tery if possiblg. Sail was set and we
sailed and drifted before the gale, until
this morning we were off the Columbia
River. About 10 o'clock this morning
the schooner's back broke clear across
under the main hatch. I could not en
ter the Columbia and. finding the
schooner would weather Cape Disap
pointment, I headed her for the sandy
beach In order to save the Iive3 of the
balance of my crew."

ATTEMPT TO MAKE FOOD CONTRABAND
IS CERTAIN TO RESULT IN FRICTION
Issue V/iJl Be Raised by the United States Government Over the
First Seizure of Supplies Shipped From the Pacific
Coast to Either Russia or Japan.
WASHINGTON, Peb. 22.â Officials
here are apprehensive that friction may
follow the eSCorts of the belligerents in
Asia to define contraband of war in a
manner injurious to American trade.
While the matter has not yet been
treated in the negotiations had with
Russia and Japan on the one side and
the United State* on the other, there is
reason to believe that some of the Euro- !
jjea.n X'O^'^rs. have alrAidy been con
fronted with threatened restrictions
upon their trade, which they are dis
poeed to refist.
A vast o.uantity of American food
stuffs is now aflcat, destined for both
Russia and Japan, and it is probable
thnt the question will be very speedily
raif^d as to whether or not these sup
plies are contraband of war. The
United States has in recent years in
stetid that foodstuffs were not contra
band and could not be seized by a bel
ligerent unless it were shown that the
poods were consigned to or clearly in
tendc-d for a belligerent. This principle
was ic-rogTuzed by the British Govern
ment during the Transvaal war and
British courts awarded considerable
sums of money to American- shippers
on account of food seized by British
tranships.
TREATMENT OF REFUGEES.
The State Department' has heard
nothing whatever from United States
Consul Miller at Newchwang concern
ing the troubles he has had with the
Russian r>Â«Ticials in endeavoring to
xarry out the department's instruc
tions to look after Japanese interests
at that port.
The State Department has learned
through Emery, the Vice and Deputy
Consul at Chefu, that the Russian
Government has undertaken the trans
portation of the Japanese refugees
Who were at Newchwang, or were
bound for that port from interior Man
<hurian towns, to Port Arthur and
Dairy. Consul Miller is thus deprived
of an opportunity to extend protection
to more than a few remaining Japan
ese. The i-urpose of the Russian
Government in making, this move is
said to be to prevent Japanese leaving
Manchuria with news of the condition
of the defenses of the towns in military
occupation by the Russians. It is un
derstood that Newchwang and the line
of railroad connecting it with Harbin
vn the north and Port Arthur on the
south are especial objects of solicitude,
ap there are still many weak spots in
the scheme of defense which the Rus
sians desire to conceal.
The same desire to prevent informa
tion leaking out respecting what is go
ing on in Manchuria is said to be back
of the Russian refusal to receive Edwin
Morgan as Consul of the United States
at Dalny. Morgan is to sail next Friday
from San Francisco for the East, and
will remain at Shanghai until it is de
termined by the <-ourse of events wheth
er he may proceed to his post.
EVANS GOES TO HONGKONG.
The battleship Kentucky, flagship of
the American Asiatic fleet, has been
ordered to Hongkong, where she will
b*Â» docked for minor repairs. It is re
garded as probable that Admiral Evans

ron accompany hi^n to Hongkong, al
though he has not advised the depart
ment to this effect.
It is not intended at present that the
battleships shall go farther north. The
double-turreted monitors Monadnock
and Monterey, also a part of the battle
ship squadron, are at Shanghai and
Canton, China, respectively. The cruiser
New Orleans and the gunboat Wil
mington have been recalled from Chefu
leet their presence there might be re
sented by one of the belligerents, and
are on their way to Shanghai, where
the Raleigh is awaiting the arrival of
the remainder of the cruiser squadron.
The cruiser Cincinnati is in Philippine
waters under orders for Shanghai, and
the San Francisco reported on Satur
day at Bombay, India, on her way to
Chinese waters.
Rear Admiral Evans has distributed
the gunboat division which is attached
to the battleship squadron as follows:
The Callao was last reported at 'Can
ton, the El Cano at Nankin, the Helena
in the mud dock at Newchwang, the
Vicksburg at Chemulpo, Korea, and the
Villalobo at Hankow.
Of the Philippine squadron of gun
boats. Rear Admiral Stirling command
ing, the Annapolis and the Frolic are at
Shanghai and the remainder are in
Philippine waters.
Of the fleet of auxiliaries, according
to week-end reports, the collier Pom
pey is at Chemulpo and the supply ship
Zafiro is on its way to Cavite.
FLEET TO BE INCREASED.
Naval officers are considering earn
estly the strengthening of the Ameri
can Asiatic fleet in view of the vast
interests of this country in the Philip
pines and in China and Korea and the
probability that disturbances may ne
cessitate their protection at any time.
At the game time, while the fleet is
regarded as too small, there is a de
sire to avoid exciting the suspicions
of the Old World powers, lest this Gov
ernment may be put in the false light
of interfering in the Eastern struggle,
notwithstanding our declaration of ab
solute neutrality. A high naval officer
to-night said: \
"The need of increasing the Asiatic
fleet has been long felt. It was in
tended that the new battleship â¢ Ohio,
building at the Union Iron Works in
San Francisco, should be sent to the
Asiatic station in the spring, and that
she should be followed by the armored
cruiser South Dakota and the protected
cruiser Milwaukee as soon as these ves
sels are completed. The Ohio, how
ever, will not be ready before autumn,
and we are now considering the dis
patch within the next month or two
of an additional battleship. It has been
suggested that the Iowa be selected for
this mission, but no decision has been
reached. She is now receiving rush re-
pairs at the Kew York navy yard.
"In addition the Tacoma, which was
commissioned a short time ago and is
getting ready for sea, has been tenta
tively selected to go to Asia as the re
lief of one of the vessels of the cruiser
squadron, but under present circum
stances it is probable that none of the
cruiser squadron will be brought home
now, however many ships are added
to it. It also has been suggested
the New York, now at Panama, be re
turned to the Asiatic station and that
she make the cruise with the Tacoma.
This is undecided and the uncertainty
of the Panama situation, together with
the fact that the New York is due for
a thorough overhauling, rather mili
tates against sending that vessel to
join Admiral Evans' fleet.
ADMIRAL EVANS' ORDERS.
"So rapidly are events in the Far
East moving that it is impossible to
say one day what move on the Asiatic
station the next day's developments
may demand. It was originally sug
gested that the battleship squadron
go ur> to Chefu, but tl.ig was not ap
proved and an order was issued for the
battleships to remain in Philippine wa
ters and for the cruiser squadron to
assemble at Shanghai. Repairs to the

valves of tliÂ« Kentucky, the flagship of
the Asiatic station, have necessitated
the sending of that ship to Hongkong
to be docked, and it is probable the
other ships of the squadron, the battle
ships Oregon and Wisconsin, will ac
company her. Meantime the cruisers
will be used to keep in communication
with our agents at Newchwang, Chefu,
Chemulpo and Seoul."
Rear Admiral Evans has cabled the
Navy Department expressing a wish
to remain in the Far East for the presV
ent, in the event that the Kentucky Ds
not to be brought home when repaired.
He feels that the situation is extremely
important out there and for this rea
son offers to remain, although his time
of sea duty Is up next month, and the
plan is for him to return to New York
on his flagship. The department has
cabled him, leaving the matter entirely
to his judgment, and. the announce
ment was made to-night by a high of
ficial that the department had every
confidence in the wisdom of Admiral
Evans' decision. It is expected that
the docking of the Kentucky will show
just what repairs the ship needs, and
it was said to-night that she may be
on her way home within two weeks.
The Kentucky would come by way of
Suez, making the usual stops.
POSSIBLE NAVAL CHANGES^
In the event that Admiral Evans
decides to return new orders will be is
sued immediately assigning him to the
presidency of the Lighthouse Board.
Rear Admiral P. H. Cooper, now com
manding the' cruiser squadron of the
Asiatic fleet, will be named as the suc
cessor of Admiral Evans in supreme
command of the station and will in
turn be succeeded by Rear Admiral
Yates Sterling, now commanding the
Philippine squadron, the command of
that squadron being taken by Rear
Admiral William Folger.
SAVES HIS LIFE BY

and Has a Narrow Escape
From Death.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 22. â Dan Ply
male, superintendent of bridges and
buildings of the San Francisco and
Northwestern Railroad, had r a narrow
escape from being killed Saturday. He
was engaged in directing the removal
of a quantity of debris abcAit the ap
proach to the railroad bridge across
the Van Duzen, near Alton. The
man was standing on the forward end
of a flatcar, which was being pushed
along by an engine, and when he gave
a stop signal the engineer applied the
airbrake so suddenly as to throw him
from the car. Plymale fell ahead of
the slowly approaching train, and, be
ing unable to get oft* the track, lay
down between the rails and' one car
passed over him. The brakebeam of
the car struck him and Plymale suf
fered fractures of the upper- and lower
jaws and one finger of his left hand
was so shockingly torn as to necessi
tate amputation. Small hope is held
out of saving the remaining fingers of
the -hand, which were also badly
crushed. The man undoubtedly saved
his life by lying between the rails.
The engineer did not notice the acci
dent that had happened to Plymale
until several seconds had elapsed.

A GLOOM OVER THE SENATE
Statesman Exercised a Powerful Influence in' Upper House
and His Fellow Members Were Shocked When He Died.
Senator Was an Affable Man and Always Approachable
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL. BAR
TON, WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â The
shadow of the loss which the country
suffers in the death of. Senator Hanna
was cast from almost the day he so
far acknowledged himself ill as "to
remain away from his place in the
Senate. He. was then said to be suf
fering only an indisposition following
an attack of the grip." the mere ab
sence of .the strong figure, the knowl
edge that-he was not well, the. faint
possibility that what was said as^ to
the trifling nature of his sickness
might not be tr.ua. seemed, to. bear, upon
the chamber and to be felt over all
Its deliberations. When he 1 returned
from Ohio some weeks ago- he was
not well. â¢ He had caught cold, he
said. He was seen in the Senate after
that only a few times and for a few
hours. When there came to be con
sultations of doctors and when finally
it was definitely announced, that the
trifling indisposition .had developed
into typhoid the great place tlmt Mar
cus A. Hanna held in men's minds and
men's affairs was made manifest. The
day .before his death conflicting re
ports, encouraging and discouraging,
followed one another about the city.
GRIEF AT HANNA'S DEATH.
Senate and HouBe adjourned very
early, having done almost nothing and
confessedly unable to do much, except
to wonder and inquire what was the
latest report, and was it reliable. At
the Arlington Hotel, where the sick
man lay, the order of silence had been
in force for days, and its observance
became the more notable with the gath
ering crowd. --.For-- with adjournment
the lobby "filled up and anxious friends
overran the house. - Men moVed about
with Plow and careful step and spoke
in subdued tones and whispers." Bulle
tins were posted at the clerk's desk,
and every man maintained hope until
the late bulletins dismissed and finally
forbade it. Notwithstanding ". such
preparation the actual announcement
of death, the realization that Marcus
A. Hanna's place in affairs was perma
nently vacant caused among these, his
associates, something akin to a sensa
tion, a panic. Many of them wept. One
of them, a Senator, gave way to unre
strained grief, to sobs and tears, finally
collapsed 4 and had to be led away to
his home. These are the manifestations
of that which is not widely known
concerning Senator Hannaâ the power
that he had to attract and hold men
to him with ties of friendshipâaffec
tion. Before the country at large he
had but fairly emerged from the effect
of such a malignant misrepresentation
as perhaps no other man had suffered.
"Mr. Hanna was one of the easiest
men to approach that I knew, and to
get an interview fromâ when he had
anything to say for publication," said
a newspaper man who has looked down
on 'the proceedings of Congress from
the press gallery for many years.
"When he had nothing to say he said
that, he had nothing to say, and that
meant that the interview was ter
minated. There was never any nonsense
about Hanna of any kind whatever. He
was always direct and to the point. If
he had anything to say he would give
you the time necessary to say it, and
that was. all.' No newspaper man in
Washington but would swear by Han
na. He could be abrupt and blunt, but
the impression was carried that it was
because .his time was valuable. I never
saw him idle a minute.
SENATOR A BUSY MAX.
"In the Senate chamber if he wasn't
listening to some other member he was
busy all the time. I never yet have
seen him in the attitude of twirling his
thumbs. When Hanna first came to the
Senate it was with the reputation of a
successful business man and a great
political manager. We were all inter
ested as to what figure he would cut
in statecraft. Everybody knows what it
has been. I saw him when he first rose
to address the Senate. Oratory was an
entirely unrVied field with him, and it
was somewhat late to develop such an
accomplishment. It was with consider
able diffidence that he made his first at
tempt, but he soon came to be recog
nized as one of the readiest debaters
on the floor, quick to avail himself of
every fair advantage and to minimize
the points of his adversary.
But Senator Hanna was not the ab
rupt and gruff man that this single
view might make him appear. He was,
in fact, a joker and. his house, until
the ill health of his wife prevented, was
noted for its hospitality and cordial
entertainment. His last public appear
ance was at a session of the Gridiron
Club. The Gridiron Club is a bohemian
affair, largely composed of newspaper

men. Its frequent dinners are notable
for the riot of, fun and the extraord
inary liberty, taken with the names of
prominent public men that prevail
there. Mr. Hanna is said to have mad*

was overtaken for a moment with stage

the" wittiest and cleverest addresses
heard there. This last session was heftl

AT THE GRIDIRON* CLUB.
The utmost liberty of speech Is in
dulged in with reference to the dis
tinguished guests, who always prize
and. accept invitations. For.it is an
axiom of the club that "no reporters
are admitted." It is a sort of executive
session that, unlike those of the Sen
ate, remains inviolate. Nothing that
is said there ever gets into printâ that
is, nothing material. On the occasion
referred to, for instance, one member,
representing a ventriloquist, introduced
a string of manikins â all very much
alive but representing the conventional
thing. . Each manikin was labeled with
the name of some distinguished guest-
Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Gorman, Mr. For
ake'r and Mr. Hanna. among them. The
operator "addressed to each of these a
series of very pertinent and impertinent
questions, the answers to which, given
by the : manikin in a high treble, were
very entertaining to all present. Mr.
Hanna was not called upon this time
to make an address, not because H was
thought he could not respond but be
cause a club member preferred to speak
for him. Concealed by ferns and talk
ing through a megaphone he presented
the Hanna manner and style of ad
dress with great success. That was a
month ago.-
The funeral of a Senator is a matter
of precedent.' That which character
ized the first as observed by and in the
chamber must characterize all others.
The ceren.ony is made impressiw by
simplicity â simplicity is the keynote.
DISAPPOINTED CAL.I*X)RN'IANS.
The California delegation, and es
pecially the southern members, are
very much disappointed over the fail
ure of the attempt to get the neces
sary appropriation for the Los Angeles
Federal building into the urgent defi
ciency bill. The amendment passed
the Senate, but failed in the House in
spite of the recommendation of the
Secretary of the Treasury. The House
members of the joint committee to
which the bill was finally referred ab
solutely refused to reinsert it because
there were so many other cases of the
same kind that to insert one would be
to make trouble and enemies. * These
House members of the committee said
they would not oppose a general bill
covering all the cases. Such a bill will
be introduced. In case of failure here
an attempt will be made to provide for
It in the sundry civil bill. So that
there is yet a good fighting chance for
the appropriation.
Daniels' bill granting to the Califor
nja Development Comprn; the right
to divert the water of the Colorado
River for. irrigation purposes is going
to raise some interesting questions.
The California Development Company
has, in fact, already diverted the water
and has built seVeral hundred miles of
ditches, demonstratv d its utility by
growing big crops of alfalfa and things
in the desert, or what wa3 the desert.
NEW IRRIGATION* ISSUE.
Now the question has been raised as
to their right to do so, the Colorado
being listed as a navigable stream.
The State of California has given the
company the right to the use of 10,000
cubic feet per second, which is more
water than there is in the river at
certain times of the yearâ and the com
pany is prepared to take it, or at least,
all there is. Now, the Government has
had a plan for employing the Colorado
River in the same way, "and has made
large withdrawals of the desert lands
from location with this in view. The
Government plan is to take the water
at a point above where the private com
pany appropriates it. Should the plan
be carried outâ and a large sum of
money has already been spent on it
it would leave the private company
without water, and its work would go
for nothing. If Mr. Daniels* bill
passes it would confirm the right of
the private company and the Govern
ment would have to quit, because it
would have no right to deprive the
company of that which the bill grants
it. Governmenr officialsâ those in the
Geological^ Survey who have charge of
the irrigation work â differ as to the
merits of the case. Some â or, at least,
one â claims precedence for the Gov
ernment in the enterprise, and argues
against the bill before the committee.
Another and higher official Is disposed
to let the private enterprise spend its
money and reap its reward, if it will,
seeing no point in having the Govern
ment spend money where private in
dividuals are willing, and the same end
be served. It is certain, however, that
there will be opposition to yie bill, but
the company is preparing to make a
hard fight. The jquestlon of the right
to divert the water of a stream be
cause It is navigable, and because the
diversion will render it otherwise, will
not likely be forged, however, as the
objection would be against the Gov
ernment as well.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
jLONDON, Feb. 23.â Telegrams from
Vienna and Salonica published herÂ©
this morning give alarming but un
confirmed details of preparations point
ing to a war between Turkey and Bul
garia. The Sofia correspondent of the
Daily Mall telegraphs that the Bul
garian Government has declared a state
of siege over a zone nineteen miles
wide extending along the frontier from
Kustendll to the Black Sea, with a
view of preventing the Incursions of
armed bands.
Advices from Berlin to the Birming
ham Post to-day state that the Kaiser,
appreciating the extreme seriousness of
affairs in the Far East and recognising
tho fact that Russia will have her re
sources ' taxed 'â  to " the uttermost for
some time to come, has assured the
Czar of his resolve to prevent by all
possible means * an outbreak In the
Balkans. Every pressure . wifl bs
brought to bear upon Turkey to this
end. It Is regarded as certain, say thÂ«
advices, that the Sultan will listen to
the Kaiser more readily than to any
other man.
PARIS, Feb. 22.â M. Popovitch, the
Servian Minister here, said to-day:
"From the time of the rupture of
relations between Japan and Russia
the sympathy of all Servians has been
with the Czar, many of whom have
sought service under his colors. In
Servia no one intends to seek to profit
by the Russian embarrassment to fo
ment a revolt in the Balkans. I be
lieve this is also the attitude "of other
Balkan states. Without the support
of Austria and Russia they would be
powerless to settle the situation as they
wish. Should war break out in the
Balkans Russia and Austria would in
tervene In order to prevent a change
In the status quo. Moreover, war would
be dangerous, because it would end in
economic disaster and the financial and
industrial situation of the principalities
would be gravely embarrassed. In any
case Servia asks only to be allowed to
collaborate in the work of applying the
reforms in Macedonia."

vians 3 francs 50 centimes. During the

business was inactive" and calm, but the
good tone continued to the close, inter
nationals showing a general advance of

Rendue, secretary general of the
Chamber of Stockbrokers, said to-day
that the measures determined upon by
Finance Minister Bouvier and Devere"
nuil, representing the Chamber of Stock
brokers, at the conference yesterday
evening would, he felt confident, result
in a continuance of the good .tone of
the market. He added that there Would
be no active Intervention by the Gov
ernment, which will only seek to pre
vent the circulation of false reports,
and on their part the brokers w-ould
urge their clients .to be less excitable.
Regarding the offer 'of the French
Red Cross Society to send relief imme
diately to Manchuria, the Russian Em
bassador here has written to the Rus
sian authorities on the subject. He
says the land operations will not com
mence for some weeks, and then only
should practical relief measures be
taken. This statement is accepted as
an indication that the Russians wish to
complete the concentration of their
troops before engaging in a
combat.
The Japanese officials here insist that
Takahashi, the vice president of the
Bank of Japan at Tokio. and Baron
Kaneko, who start from Tokio on Feb
ruary 24 on a mission to the United
States, are not charged to enter into
any negotiations with the United

PARIS, Feb. 22. â The body of Hen-
pending. In a conversation, the Min
ister to-day said:
"Illness has prevented my transmit
ting heretofore an important communi
cation which I received from ray Gov
ernment several days ago about the re
ported trouble in the Roumanian
provinces. I hope to see the Secretary
of State some time this week, and have
a conference with him on the subject.
To correct the false Impression which
already, I fear, has gained ground in
this country about the attitude of my
country toward the reforms in Rou
mania, I shall give you the substance
of the cablegrams from my Govern-
ment. It is to this effect:
'â¢ 'The Porte most strenuously de
nounces as maliciously false the re
ports which have been given wide cir
culation in certain European papers
that trouble is breaking out In Rou
mania because of the failure of the Im
perial Government to carry out the
promised reforms. The facts In the
case are that the Imperial Government
is fulfilling, to the letter, its pledges;
the .reforms are being vigorously in
augurated and there Is no trouble in
that section, as reported. ' "
Of the Balkan situation. Chekib Bey.
who has had much' experience in that
section, said:
"Although my advices are meager,
the news I get indicates that the Bul
garians are assuming an attitude and
pursuing a course to which it will be
Impossible for the Imperial Govern
ment to submit much longer with pa
tience. It is reported that they are
arming the inhabitants, stirring up
strife In Macedonia and doing every
thing possible to harass the Imperial
Government. I hope this i3 not true,
but if the reports be true hostilities in
the Balkans cannot much longer bÂ«
avoided."
"Do you think it possible that Tur
key will address a note to the powers
on this subject?" the Minister waa
asked.
"I was interested," he replied, "to
see published some days ago the note
of last year in which Turkey clearly
announced her position and called the
attention of the powers to the unbear
able conduct of Bulgaria. ' While not
new, the contents of the note were
most timely and what was said then
on this point can be with truth reit

to Hay's Note.
Both Powers Place
Manchuria in the
. War Zone.
TFAEHIXGTONr, Feb. 22.â The State
repartment has made public the text of
the notes exchanged with the powers
respecting the Far Eastern war. The
United States' note has already been
.published. The text of the remaining
cotes follows:
On February 13 the following answer
was received from the Japanese Govern
ment, addressed to the American Min
ister in Tokio:
"In response to your note of the 12th
tost, on the subject of the neutrality of
China during the existing war, I beg to
Fay that the Imperial Government,
sharing with the Government of the
United States In the fullest measure
the desire to avoid as far as possible
any disturbance of the orderly condi
. tion of affairs now prevailing in China,
is prepared to respect the neutrality
and administrative entity of China out
ride the regions occupied by Russia as
long as Russia, making a similar en
rajrement, fulfills in good faith the
terms and conditions of such engage
mcnt. fl
On February 19 the following answer
*as received from the Russian Govern
ment:
â¢ "The Imperial Government, sharing
completely the desire to insure the tran
quillity of China, is ready to adhere to
an understanding with other powers for
the purpose of safeguarding the neu
trality of that empire on the following
conditions:
â¢Firptâ China must herself strictly
observe all the clauses of neutrality.
'Secondâ The Japanese Government
must loyally observe the engagement*
entered into with the powers, as well as
the principles generally recognized by
t'ho law of nations.
Thirdâ That it is well understood
â¢that neutralization in no case can be
extended to Manchuria, the territory of
v hieh by the force of events will serve
aip a field of military operations."
'â¢n the same day the State Depart
ment sent the following telegram to the
â¢ <">*>verr:ments of Russia and Japan,
rrrmmunicating its purport to the other
powers interested:
"The answer of the Russian Govern
ment is viewed as responsive to the
prdposal made hy the United States, as
veil as hy the other potmen, and this
Government will have pleasure in com
municating it forthwith to the Govern
ments of China and Japan, each of
i\ hich has already informed us of its
adherence to the firinciples set forth in
our circular proposal."

SUMMARY OF WAR NEWS.
Four Russian torpedo-boats have been captured by the Japan
ese squadron off Port Arthur by means of imitating Russian sig
nals, and another action off that harbor is reported from several
sources. . '
Japan ts reported to be taking steps to compel the Chinese to
maintain neutrality, Shanghai oflicials having been bribed to allow
the Russian gunboat Mandjur to remain there.
The Russian Enibassador in Paris has stated that land opera
tions would not begin for some weeks, and advices front Japanese
sources say that the Japanese are not eager to press the campaign
in Korea.
Viceroy Alexieff, with his full staff, has reached Harbin and es
tablished headquarters there.
GREAT DIFFICULTY
IN TRANSPORTATION
OF RUSSIAN TROOPS
BERLIN, Feb. 22.â The Militar Woch
enblatt, the organ of the German gen
eral staff, has published an article dis
cussing Russia's prospects of reinforc
ing her army in East Asia- The paper
takes a pessimistic view of the capacity
of the Trans-Siberian Railroad, and
especially of the section crossing Lake
Baikal, where, It says, the difficulties
to be overcome are enormous. The lim
ited capacity of the line is said to be
a much more serious matter than the
threatened damage to It by natives.
The paper estimates the present troop
ruovlng capacity of the railroad from
Russia's experience of last summer in
moving two brigades to Tschita, east
of Lake Baikal, which was accom
plished at the rate of only eight and a
hclf miles an hour. At this rate It
would take thirty-six days to convey
2^,000 men from the Ural Mountains to
Mukden or Vladivostok.
The paper assumes the present
strength of the Russian army In East
ern Asia to be 158,761 men, and upon
the foregoing estimate of time required
to move troops it declares it will take
until April 20 for Russia to raise the
strength of her East Asiatic army to
233,000 men.
The paper is of the opinion that the
easiest thing for Japan to do to com
pel Russia to abandon Manchuria is
to strike at the center of the country;
in other words, to concentrate her
forces against Harbin.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 22.â Prince
Khilkoff. Minister of Railroad Com
munication, has proceeded for Man
churia from Irkutsk, after having seen
that the railroad on the ice across Lake
Baikal was laid. He was personally en
trusted with $250,000 to effect the expe
ditious termination of this work. Prince
Khilkoff reports that the Siberian
railroad is able to move 30,000 men a
day to their destination, but that the
transit from western points to the Far
East will require six weeks.
Hearty manifestations of patriotism
are reported from Helsingfors, Finland.
It is said that several hundred persons
carrying Russian flags paraded there
on Sunday night and sang Russian na
tional hymns before the residences of
the Governor General and other au
thorities and the French consulate. In
the Russian theater the audience re-

peatedly demanded the playing of the
Russian national hymn. A consider
able sum has been subscribed in vari
ous cities for Red Cross work.
RUSSIA DENOUNCES
CONDUCT OF JAPAN
IN NOTE TO POWERS
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â Russia is
addressing to the powers, either
through their representatives in St.
Petersburg, the Emperor's envoys, or
probably through both, a vigorous com
munication charging Japan with re
peated violation of the laws of nations,
first, as the note alleges, in threatening
to attack a neutral port, Chemulpo, un
less the Russian ships within come out
to face^ an overwhelming force, and
second, it states, in attacking Port Ar
thur before war had been declared and
while the Japanese Minister at St.
Petersburg was still enjoying the pro
tection and the courtesies of the Rus
sian Government, to which, It is
claimed, he had Just previously ad
dressed a communication expressing
his belief that the interruption of dip
lomatic relations between the two coun-
tries would be brief.
In the diplomatic corps the news of
Russia's intended address to the powers
has caused great Interest. A diplomat
whose Government is inclined to sym
pathize with Russia said that the Rus
sian Government did not expect other
nations to pass upon the attack at Port
Arthur, but as to the threatened attack
on Chemulpo this diplomat said the
Russian Government expected that the
powers, In the Interest of international
law, would give this â  subject their
earnest consideration. Several foreign
naval commanders at CJhemulpo, he
said, were reported to have protested
against the action of the Japanese
commander at the time, and if It were
true that the American commander re
fused to johv with the other foreign
commanders In protesting to the Japa
nese commander against his action in
threatening the town, he thought it
likely the action of the commander of
the Vicksburg would be the subject of
an exchange of views between the St.
Petersburg and Washington govern
ments.

FLEET MAY PASS THE DARDANELLES
Continued From Page 1, Column 6
been notified that she has been cap
tured by the Russians at Vladivostok.
The latest advices of Baron Hayashi,
the Japanese Minister to Great Britain,
lead him to believe that the Japanese
troops may now wait possibly two or
three months before undertaking ag
gressive operations in Manchuria. HÂ«
said:
"Â»We have found that Russia is so
unexpectedly unprepared that I should
not be surprised if the Japanese land
forces contented themselves with es
tablishing a thorough organization and
advancing as the construction of the
railroad toward the Yahi River pro
gresses. Russia appears to be less
prepared than was China y in 1S95. I
believe that only three trains a day can
be run through Manchuria. Supposing
these are equally divided between
troops and supplies, as would be neces
sary, Russia could not perceptibly
strengthen her land forces before April.
Japan's naval coup has been so unex
pectedly successful that I rather think,
our. troops will take their time. The
shallow inlets are now frozen over, re
tarding the disembarkation of our
forces. This is especially true at Port
Arthur, where another landing of
troops is impossible, owing to the ice."Â«
Baron Hayashi does not credit the
report that 2500 Russian soldiers have
been killed in an outpost engagement
at the Yalu River. He says there is
no Japanese force in that vicinity large
enough to inflict such a los.5. i
The only naval development Baron
Hayashi expects in the near future is
an attack on the Japanese fleet by the
powerful Russian torpedo flotilla at
Port Arthur, hitherto unused. On the
Japanese side, except possible actions
against the Russian Vladivostok
squadron, the Japanese Minister does
not look for developments at present,
believing Admiral Togo w:ll be satisfied
to keen the disabled Russian squadron
prisoners at Port Arthur.
The Minister credits the Russians
with having barely ' 100,000 troops in
Manchuria.

Greaser and his eldest son spent some

went for a walk up the canyon. V
X little later., a second son, who*. is

and while trying to kill a lizard with
the butt end of the gun the weapon
was discharged and a bullet was fired
into his abdomen. The boy was

NAGASAKI, Feb. 22.â The steamship
Stolberg has arrived here fromf Vladi
vostok with twenty white foreigners,
1500 Chinese and fifty Japanese. She
brings in addition forty survivors of
the Japanese steamship Nakamura
Maru, which was sunk by the Rus
sian cruiser squadron from Vladivostok
on February 11. Two men were drowned
during their transfer to the Russian
ships. The survivors were well treated
and provided with return passage.
In an interview the captain of the
Nakamura Maru says that the Russian
cruisers first signaled the Nakamura
Maru to follow them and afterward
signaled that all on board should leave
the steamshio within fifteen minutes.
In the .meantime the warships opened
fire on the steamship. While the steam
ship was lowering her boats two men
were wounded and fell into the sea.
The remainder of the crew were taken
on board the cruiser Gromoboi and
provided with clothing. They were
later transferred, on the loth, to the
steamship Stolberg for Vladivostok, but
the Stolberg, after proceeding five
miles, was stopped by the Russians and
detained until the 19th.
The Vladivostok squadron intended
to bombard Hakodate, but a snowstorm
prevented the vessels entering , the
straits of Tsugaru. They intend to
make another attempt to reach Hako
date in March with the cruisers, five
torpedo-boats and an armed transport.
The civilians in Vladivostok have
been ordered to leave, owing to the
scarcity of food, as the Government Is
taking everything available. A panic
has seized the Chinese, who are leav
ing by hundreds.
ATTACK OX PORT ARTHUR.
TOKIO, Feb. 22.â It is reported here
to-day that Vice Admiral Togo has
again attacked Port Arthur. It is im
possible to confirm the statement, and
the Navy Department says it received
no news from Togo to-day. It is con
sidered very probable that the vice ad
miral has made another attack on the
Russians, as he is engaged in blockad-
ing Port Arthur. >
The news of the escape from death
of the crew of the Nakamura Maru
was received in Tokio with satisfac
tion and perceptibly lessens the feeling
of bitterness toward the Russians on
account of the sinking cf the ship.
A prisoners' intelligence bureau has
been created and regulations regarding
the treatment of prisoners of war have
been published. The Tokio Govern
ment, it is understood, has anticipated
the necessity of soon providing for the
care of Russian prisoners.
Baron Kanekcr, who, as already an
nounced, will sail for the United States
on Thursday, is charged with a diplo
matic mission concerning the neutral
relations of the two countries. Vice
Governor Takahashi of the Bank of
Japan, who goes to America and Eng
land,, will investigate the financial sit
uation generally, with a view of float
ing a loan later if one should be needed.
FRKX'CII COURSE SATISFACTORY.
â¢ The assurances of France that the
Russian flotilla, except two torpedo
boat destroyers which have been dis
armed and will be detained until the
war ends, have left Jibutll, French So
maliland, reached Tokio to-day and
produced a feeling of general satisfac
tion. The Government is confident of
the intention of France to refrain from
permitting the Russians to use her
ports as bases for naval operations,
but was concerned over the long delay
of (he flotilla at Jibutil, and had made
representations to France on the sub
ject. The reaffirmation of French neu
trality is highly reassuring tothe pres
ent diplomatic situation. ' It is -the
opinion here that the maintenance of
the neutrality of Oriental ports is ex
tremely advantageous to Japan, as it
insures her mastery of the naval sit
uation, and limits the Russian source
of supply to the trans-Siberian rail
way.

RUSSIANS OBSERVE
LENT WITH PRAYERS
FOR WAR TRIUMPHS
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 22.âCarni
val week closed on Saturday night and
yesterday all classes of the populace,
from the highest to the lowest, began
the observance of Lent with even more
than the customary rigor, doing pen
ance and praying for the success of
the Russian arms. The Czar will pass
the week fasting at the Winter Pal-
ace and immediately afterward the
court will remove to Tsarskoe-Selo, the
Czar's favorite abode.
Their Majesties and their children
attended religious services in the chapel
of the Winter Palace this morning from
9 to 11 o'clock, and will do so daily this
week. At 1 o'clock in the evening they
joined the Dowager Empress at the
Anitchkov Palace at a similar service.
On February 26 the Czar will go to
confession and visit the imperial tombs
in the fortress of St. Peter and St.
Paul, and also the Chapel of the Sa
vior in the house of Peter the Great-
Their Majesties on February 28 will
take the sacrament. The strict ob
servance of Lent will then be some
what relaxed until Passion week, when
similar rites will be observed.
Heavy snows and blizzards over the
Siberian Railway, especially east of
Baikal, are largely increasing the diffi
culties of transporting troops, besides
better enabling Chinese brigands to
operate. Japanese agents are reported
north of Vladivostok, inciting the bri
gands to action.
The Novoe Vremya, cornmentinjr
upon the report of Pavloff, who was
Russian Minister at Seoul, of the fight
at Chemulpo, declares that Japan's ac
tion there has stricken her from the
list of civilized powers and predicts a
revival of European solidarity against
the "wild Asiatic enemy." The paper
re-emphasizes the inevitability of Ions
delay befc-re extensive military opera
tions will be possible, owing to the im
mense area to be defended and the
rigors of the climate.

of ihe mix^d commissions at Caracas,
nor to judge their action or the char
acter of the warlike operations of the
blockading powers, nor to decide if the
three blockading powers exhausted all
pacific means to prevent the necessity
for employing force. The tribunal de
cides that it is only in a position to
certify that since 1301 Venezuela re
fused arbitration proposed on several
occasions by Germany and Great Brit
ain; that after the war no formal treaty
of peace was concluded: that the oper
ations of the blockaders were stopped
befvre they had received satisfaction
for all their claims, and. further, that
the Question of preferential treatment
was submitted to arbitration. The tri
bunal declares that it found and recog
nized in these facts precious evidence
in favor of the great principle of arbi
tration in all phases of international
conflict. In adhoring to the protocols
the blockaders could not have intended
to renounce their acquired rights, nor
thÂ«Mr privileged de facto position. The
Government of Venezuela itr*If has
rc< oRnized in principle the well-found
fdness of their claim?, while it had not
recognized those of the non-blockad
ing powers, and until the end of Jan
uary, 1503. made not the slightest pro
test against the claims for preferential
treatment.
Throughout the diplomatic negotia
tion? Venezuela constantly dis
tinguished between the allied powers
and the neutrals, these latter not
having protested against the clafms
for preference of the blockading
powers, either at the time the war
stopped nor immediately after the
signature of the protocal of February
13. The Government of Venezuela only
agreed in respect to the allied powers
to offer special guarantees for the ful
fillment of its engagements. The good
faith which should direct international
relations Imposes the duty in the tri
bunal of declaring that the words "all
claim*," employed by the Venezuelan
representatives in the negotiations with
th* 3 representatives of allied powers,
could relate only to the latter powers,
r'.'eutrals could in some respect profit
by the circumstances created, by the
operations of thf> war without requiring
new rights, the rights already acquiring
remaining absolutely intact.
In the decision the United States is
charged merely to supervise the carry
ing out of the decision regarding costs.
After the delivery of the decision.
President MouravlefE (the Russian Min
ister of Justice), in a short speech, de
clared that the findings had been
reached after a most minute and most
impartial investigation. Like all human
acts, he added, the decision was sus
ceptible to criticism, but now it was
made every one should accept it. The
arbitration, begun in times of peace,
had onded amidst t'ae sinister acts of
war, whicn was a terrible obstacle in
the path of light and progress.
In spite of all good will, alas, no one
was secure against unexpected hostile
attack. A nation was obliged to accept
a war when the legitimate defense of
honor and liberty was involved. The
just providence whir -h ruled over battles
will distinguish between right and un
founded pretensions.
At the end of this war between a
Hurep^an and an Asiatic people, the
right will shine out afresh. The presi
dent concluded with saying that The
Hague arbitration tribunal remains
always the rampart of justice, truth

AMERICA XOT PL.EASED.
estate I>cp:ntmont Says Decision Places
Prcniiuni on Force.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 22.â A promi
nent ofllcial of the State Department,
when shown the dispatch relative to the
decision in the Venezuelan arbitration,
stated that while the department re
gretted exceedingly the precedent which
The Hague tribunal had made in this
case, there was nothing for the United
States to do but accept the result philo
sophically as binding international law.,
The mere question of time when the
United Slates shall receive from Vene
zuela the amount of the awards in our
favor was the smallest consideration.
What the Government disliked was to
admit the principle that a mere show
of naval force by a creditor nation can
secure precedence in the payment of
debt over another nation that does not
exercise such force. It is regarded as a
premium on violence and as tending to
discourage nations that are disposed to
settle their claims by the peaceful
methods of diplomacy.
The Venezuelan Government, while
the principal party nominally to the
proceedings before The Hague tribunal,
was really rather indifferent as to
which powor should be paid first, rec
ognizing the fact that they must all be
paid in some order. That Government
has been carrying out the undertaking
reached in the protocols which ter
minated the allies' intervention, to set
apart 30 per cent of the customs re
ceipts at I,a Guaira and Puerto Cabello
month to month, and the money has
been placed in bank awaiting this di
rect order. The fund accumulated up
to date will be turned over to England,
Germany and Italy, as well as 30 per
cent of subsequent customs collected at
the ports named, until the claims of
these powers shall be satisfied in full.
This probably will take about two
years, and after that the claims of the
non-allied or peace powers will be taken
up and paid pro rata.
CALVE FAINTS
ON THE STAGE
Diva Is Suddenly Overcome
and Has to I5e Carried Off
by Employes of the Theater
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â Mme. Calve
fainted to-night on the stage of the
Metropolitan Opera-house toward the
close ft the performance of "Cavalleria
Rusticana." Herr Diple and two stage
hands carried her from the stage and
the curtain was rung down. Madame
Calve did not reappear in "Cavalleria,"
her place being taken by an under
study, and after about five minutes' in
terruption the opera was resumed.
A physician found Madame Calve
suffering from a weakened heart, but
he sanctioned her appearance in the
last number, the prison scene from
"Menstofele."
"Madame Calve had a tooth extract
ed on Saturday, since when she had not
been feeling well, and to this the faint

CLOVERDALB, Feb. 22. â Despite
the rain, a crowd of about 2000 per
sons came from points in Sonoma and
Marin counties to attend the citrus
fair to-day. Among Jhe prominent
visitors were General N. P. Chipman,
Arthur R. Briggs and L>. M. Fletcher
of the State Board of Trade. Com
mendable remarks were made by
General Chipman and Mr. Briggs.
G. W. Hoyle, acting chairman and

Citrus Fair Association and Sonoma
County to the members of the State
Board of Trade for the honor of their
presence and their kindly remarks as
to the fair; also to the people of So

for their loyalty to Northern Sonoma
by attending the fair, regardless of the
inclemency of the weather.
While the fair is not so much of a
success financially as on some former
occasions, the board of directors feels
well satisfied, considering the circum
stances. The words of cheer and com
mendation by the judges of fruit and
from the State Board of Trade will
nerve the people of Cloverdale to an
increased effort in future years.

TAFT A GUEST
AT A BANQUET
Secretary of War Is Honored
by Many of the Leading* Cit
izens of Ifis Former Jloine
CINCINNATI, Feb. 22.â Secretary of
War Taft was the guest of honor at a
dinner to-night at the St. Nicholas
Hotel, at which 250 plates were turned,
and the floral and general appointments
were very elaborate.
The principal address was by ex-At
torney General Judson Harmon, who
complimented Governor Taft upon the
manner in, which he had performed
his- duties as Governor of the Philip
pines, saying he was entitled to the
gratitude of his countrymen. He said:
"While the country is committed to
a course, and especially one which has
put welfare of another . people in its
charge, its honor is involved, whether
that course be one it should have taken
or one It should have avoided."
Secretary Taft, In reply, maintained
that this country was conscientiously
looking after the welfare of the people
in the Philippines. He made an elo
quent Dlea for the completion of the
work of* civilized government and edu
cation in the islands. He said the friar
question was about settled, as their
places had . been taken by Americans
and natives; that thousands of Ameri
cans were there teaching school and
hundreds of Filipinos were being edu
cated in this country and that the day
would come when the Philippines
would be for the Filipinos, but that he
would not obstruct the progress ; of
present operations to make any defi
nite declarations for - independence.
The present government in the; Phil
ippines must first succeed in complet
ing Its mission or independence would
be a failure and any change that
would abandon the Philippines would
cause such a disaster' as to disgrace
American history and modern civiliza
tion. .
WILL. SOOX ftATIFY
BASEBALL! AGREEMENT
Arrangement Between Pacific Coast
and National Leagues Seems
Satisfactory.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 22. â Rati
fication of the peace agreement with
the Pacific national organization by
the National Association of Minor
Leagues now seems .assured.
An informal conference of the mag
nates of the three class A leagues was
held to-night. President Hanlon of
the National League outlined the pro
posed agreement, which proved much
more favorable to the class A leagues
than had been expected. It is now
believed the only possible hitch will
be in the awarding of disputed .play
ers. It is thought the Pacific National
will be allowed to take all players for
whom a straight contract can be
shown providing It eliminates the one
that has been signed with a club in
side the ranks of organized baseball.
The real work will be done to-morrow,
when there will be a conference of
the representatives of all the minor
leagues and President Hanlon will
submit his official report.

COAST CITIES
GET DRENCHING
Kagiiig Torrents Take the Place
of Quiet Streams Near the
Towns of Yreka and Bedding
YREKA, Feb. 22.â Not since 1861 have
the waters in the various streams and
gulches about this place been as high
as they are to-day. Where formerly
ran slow, sluggish streams are now
running raging torrents and the dam
age to roadwavs, and bridges has been
considerable. The approaches to sev
eral railroad bridges have been swept
away, and numerous and hairbreadth
have been the escapes from death by
drowning. Humbug Gulch causes the
residents of this place a great deal of
uneasiness. So much was it feared
that the townspeople remained up all
last night prepared to defy the waters
that threatened at any moment to over
flow is banks. Fort Jones is cut off en
tirely.
REDDING, Feb. 22.â Redding was
isolated to-day, so far as stage traffic
was concerned, and railroad traffic was
crippled, owlÂ«g to the continued rains
which have brought the season's rain
fall already up to more than thirty-six
inches. The Sacramento River Is run
ning so high that the bridge ferry over
the stream at this point - Is useless.
Creeks to the west are so swollen that
trailic Is impossible.
.As the stage which left Weaverville,
Trinity County, this morning, bound
for this place, tried to ford East
Weaver Creek a few miles from its
starting point the swift current upset
the stage and carried It down stream
150 yards: Sam Miller, the only pas
senger, managed to get ashore on the
back of one of the three horses he cut
loose. Dick Heath, the driver, was
carried down stream. He landed on an
island, where he remained until relief
reached him. One horse was drowned.
GAZELLE, Feb. 22. â A bridge has
gone out near Granada, about thirty
yards from Yreka, and the railroad
track was washed out last night. Wil
low Creek threatens the Gazelle bridge.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 22.â Rain has fallen
steadily since 7 o'clock this evening,
the measurement at 11 p. ra. being .30.
For the season, 5.75, compared with
10.12 last year.
WINNEAIUCCA, Nevada, Feb. 21â
Telephone messages received here to
day report a cloudburst at Paradise,
fifty miles north. Cottonwood Creek,
running through the town, rose twelve
feet within a few minutes and both ap
proaches of the big county bridges
were' carried away. Several smaller
bridges were also washed out. It is
feared that a large loss of cattle in the
lower valleys by .drowning 1 will result.

BAKERSFIELD, Feb. 22. â The
bridge on the Edison Electric Com
pany's road In Kern Canyon was
blown up by dynamite yesterday af
ternoon and totally wrecked. The
perpetrators of the crime have not
been caught. The bridge spanned a
mining claim held by a resident of
this city,_who had been embroiled in
continued quarrels with the Edison
Company and the Power Development
Company, and is alleged, to have
made threats to destroy their property
if they attempted to build across the
land. '* .".-;
Though a very busy man, President

so he always has an Interpreter at hand
on such occasions.

German Embassador Praises
the Diplomacy of the Gov

PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 22. â Baron
Herman Speck von Stcrnberg, the Ger
man Embassador to the United States,
upon whom the University of Pennsyl
vania to-day conferred the degree of
Doctor of Laws, was the principal
speaker at the regular monthly meeting
to-night of the American Academy of
Political and Social Science at the New
Century drawing-room. A large audi
ence warmly greeted the Baron. In
the course of his address he said:
"It was tha far-seeing eye of the
Washington Government which saved
China from chaos and dismemberment
during the Boxer troubles in 1900. New
flames acain threatened to arise from
the still smoldering ashes. But in the
right moment we again see the Â»ame
ever- watchful Government arise and
invite the powers of the world to act in
concert so as to preserve the Integrity
of China and prevent a conflagration
the limit of which no human mind
would be able to foretell. Through
this strong and able stroke, not only
the powers at peace, but also those en
gaged in war, will reap the great ben
efits, and it is to be hoped that the
vast and increasing Chinese trade will
develop undisturbed."
After the Embassador had concluded
his address he was tendered a recep
tion by the members of the Academy.

IN THE IROQUOIS WIGWAM
Action of Committee Against Indorsement of Kansas City
Platform Denounced. as a Cowardly Dodgeâ Braves
Brandish Tomaha\vks--Victory for Gold Democrats
In the wigwam of the Iroquois yes
terday the scalping knife was un
fchcathed and the tomahawk was bran
.dithed. Warriors exchanged lmpreca
â tlcr.s. The brave men of the Bryan
tribe cast elurs at the committee on
resolutions because the report present
ed by- the committee did not contain
a direct indorsement of the Kansas
City platform of 1900. The warriors
â¢.w.;o were Eeekir.g to promo-te peace in
the councils of the Iroquois were de
. nounced as cowardly skulkers. The
feeling was eo intense for a while that
the spectators . were in mortal dread
least the epithet "old squaw" would
be Ehot across the room at one of the
euspected goldbugs from Ean Joaquln
County. William Jennings Bryan was
exalted as the grandest man of the
â world. In contemplating the greatness
of Bryan many of the warriors failed
to remember the Democratic achieve
ments of Jefferson and Jackson. Cleve
land's came was never mentioned and
not the slightest allusion was made
to any Democratic administration since
the days of Andrew Jackson. There
was a mild form of applause when the
name of Hearst wae mentioned in the
committee's report. The name of Liv
ernash elicited a little fluttering breeze
of adulation. The real hero of the
hour was Oscar Hocks. A great tu
mult of applause hailed the announce
ment of his election to the proud posi
tion of grand sachem of the Iroquois
League of California.
The brandish of the tomahawk and
. the .gleam of the scalping knife did
not strike terror to the hearts of the
committeemen. They fought vigorous
ly against indorsement of the silver
craze of 1S96 and 1900, and succeeded
â¢by a vote of 42 to IS in placing on the
table the proposition to amend the com
mittee's report. * â¢
â¢ So the message has gone forth to
kindred tribes that Bryan Is no longer
tho great medicine man of the Iroquois.
There was a small picture of William
Randolph Hearstâ a picture no bigger
than a man's hand â on the wall of the
wigwam.
- TALKERS TO THE FRONT.
The chief order of exercises yester
'day afternoon was talk, more talk and
â plenty of tauk. J. Aubury Jones of Al
ameda County held his own against all
comers. He wondered what spell had
come over the American people that
."'would permit them to tolerate a re
fusal on the part of Congress to ad
journ in honor of Washington's blrth
day. Is it not true, he asked, that thÂ«
words of Washington's immortal fare
vell address are a rebuke to the spirit
â¢ f. commercialism, greed and graft,
now eo rampant in the country. The
.>.Â«.! meda orator saw many danger sig
;:a!s. It was not hidden from his un
<â¢;â¢â ! standing that the dominant party
was preparing for an alliance with
"formidable European powers. He sus
.pected that the administration was
"pettiBjg ready to mix in the Russian-
Japanese war in order to obtain a
sphere of Influence in the Chinese em
. iÂ»ire.
Resolutions Introduced by Mr. Jones
r^nd amended on motion of J. C. Rud
dock of Mendocino were adopted. These
resolutions favor a quickening of the
spirit of patriotism and advise that the
'Governor of the State shall parade the
militia on Washington's birthday; that
every citizen should gpread the flag to
the breeze and that Congress should
either adjourn or hold fitting memorial
services.
There was no chance for a gcrim
â rnagre on the proposition to honor
"Washington's birthday. Ex-Senator
.Joseph Gorman suggested that the
Vchool children should walk out on that
Immortal anniversary.
The event of the afternoon was the
Report of the committee on resolutions,
W. J. Locke. San Francisco, chairman.
.Others of the committee were Judge
John E. P*aker. Modoc; Frank Garrett,
Los Angeles; W. M. Gibson, Stockton;
George Roe, Vallejo; A, D. Lennon,
' Fan Francisco; J. B. Sanford, Ukiah,
and William Cannon, San Francisco.
Sixteen subjects are treated in the
report. The course pursued bv the
dominant partv Is regarded as alarm
ing. Trusts are denounced. There is a i
declaration that the tariff laws should
be emended. The action of Congress
man Hearst in introducing a bill to
abolish the Elkins amendment and re
store the Imprisonment penalty In the
anti-trust law is indorsed. The con
tinued building un of the navy is fa
vored, with recommendation that the
.work be given to national shipyards.
The- immediate construction of an
interoceanic . canal is approved. The
Democracy of the country is congratu
lated on the seating of E. J. Livernash
from the Fourth Congressional district
of California. Scandals in the Post
ofP.ce Department are pronounced de
plorable. A Just and wise income tax
is favored. The right of labor to or
ganize is conceded. The recommenda
tion of the committee in this respect
was received with profound silence.
An intelligent system of improving the i
arid lands of the West is commended.
â¢One paragraph of the report reads as
follows:
T\> dfpicre the fact that ery official head of
nur Government should frair.e its policy upon
thÂ«; proposition that "the Â«>nd Justifies thÂ«
inf-ar.F" â Â»n<l. while we are firm in our belief
in the benefits to be derived from an infr
- oceanic canal, we regret that tuch an end
should b* brought about by the means that
the administration has pern fit to employ In its
: tTeriliiycs with ihÂ«Â« republic of Colombia. AA
\ vantage? obtained by the sacrifice of national
honor are too hiphly paid for.
. Immediately after the reading of the
report, J. B. II. Butler of San Francisco
pave the Fignal for strife. He said:

"What is the matter with the Kansas
City platform? Every principle of that
platform should be indorsed. (Great
applause.) It Is sheer hypocrisy to de
| nounce trusts and not include the
money trust, which has enslaved the
people. (Tumultuous applause.) I
move that the Kansas City platform
be indorsed."
Aft<*r a stormy discussion, in which
Max Popprr, Judge Raker, Charles
Gildea, J. Aubury Jones, J. C. Ruddock
and S. M. Hasklns participated, the
amendment was referred to the com
mittee. While the committee was out
considering the amendment the remain-
Ing warriors adopted the rest of the
report.
The committee presently came back
and presented this additional para
! graph :
"We reaffirm the time-honored prin
ciples of Democracy as expressed in
previous platforms of the party." ;
Warrior Butler exploded with rage
when he heard the foregoing. He de
clared: "This compromise is more
cowardly than the first omission. What
will the Democrats of the country say
when they hear of this cowardly
dodging? This is no time to cringe
In order to catch the contributions of
the money power. You can kick against
trusts until doomsday, but the people
will pay no heed to the kicking as long
as we shield the money trust. If Demo
crats desire to win in the great battle
this year they must abide by the true
principles of Democracy. If you con
tinue to dodge you will not get the sup
port of the people."
W. M. Gibson of Stockton hurled
back the insulting allusions. Senator
J. B. Sanford of Mendocino and Judge
Raker of Modoc joined in the hurling.
They maintained that the declarations
were broad and square.
In their Judgment, the action of the
committee was courageous, rather than
cowardly.
Mr. Gibson met the issue squarely in
declaring that the people of the coun
try were not In favor of the unlimited
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.
Judge Cubery favored indorsement of
the Kansas City platform and indi
cated that gold Democrats should leave
the room and Join the Republican
party.

J. Aubury Jones praised Bryan as the
greatest man since the days of Jeffer
son and implored against compromise
with wronsr.
M. C. Hassett held that the commit
tee's resolution was frivolous and
should be laid on the table. It reaf
firmed the Charleston platform which
upheld the doctrine of human slavery.
William M. Cannon asserted that
Bryan himself did not regard the
money question as paramount in this
campaign.
D. Gilbert Dexter said: "We would
make ourselves supremely ridiculous by
adopting all the platforms of the party
since 1792."
C. W. Moores moved to lay the last
resolution on the table. Many points of
order were raised andeonsiderable con
fusion followed. ' Mr. Butler insisted
on speaking to a question of privilege.
The question was finally put and the
motion to table the committee's sup
plemental paragraph prevailedâ ayes
42, noes 18.
Election of officers for the ensuing
year followed. Max Popper, in a
speech wherein the organization and
achievements of the Iroquois were elo
quently reviewed, nominated Super
visor Oscar Hocks for grand sachem.
Amidst great enthusiasm Hocks was
unanimously chosen as the leader of
the braves. Other officers chosen were:
Vice grand sachem, Frank Garrett, Los
Angeles; grand treasurer, Louis Metz
ger; grand secretary, L. J. Welch; as
sistant grand secretary, H. L. Bien
field; grand organizer, Charles H. Hol
combe; assistant grand organizer,
northern district, J. C. Ruddock, Men
docino; assistant grand organizer,
southern district, James E. Dunn, Los i
Angeles.
Grand Sachem A. A. Bailey presided
throughout the sessions yesterday and j
received a vote of thanks for his fair
ness*.
Among the leading Democrats at
tending were R. Porter Ashe, San
Francisco; Judge Saffold, Richmond;
Dr. R. V. Day, Los Angeles; Thomas j
J. Walsh, Joseph Gorman, Charles i
Gildea, William Ross, Max Popper and
M. C. Hassett, San Francisco. There
wag a fair representation of delegates
from the interior and the convention
was regarded as successful.
BP.AVES-AT AX-VUAIi FEAST.
Delegates to Conference Treated to
Patriotic Song and Sentiment.
Patriotic and partisan sentiment ran
high last night during the annual
Iroquois banquet.. All the delegates
to the conference were there and they
enjoyed an excellent dinner, good vocal
and instrumental music and oratory of
various degrees of attractiveness.
Barnes V. Coleman was the toast
master, and when he called the as
semblage to order every man rose to
his feet and Eang, "He's a Jolly Good
Fellow." Then the retiring president
of the club, "Joe" Gorman, was pre
sented with a diamcaid-studded locket
and the impromptu presentation ad
dress delivered by Police Judge Ca
baniss was felicitous and the re-
cipient's response neatly worded.
Mr. Coleman emphasized his state
ment that the Iroquois Club was born
for altruistic purposes and not for in
dividual advancement. "Xo m'an," he
said, "can make this club subservient
to his personal ambition â we have
said that before, and we say it again.
Let us send to the national conven
tion delegates who are looking for
principles instead of for men. And
let us promise to-night that we shall
stand behind the Presidential nominee
of our party, no matter who he
may be."
That sentiment seemed to be the ac
cepted keynote of the other speakers
when they alluded to the coming na
tional contest. Superior Judge Raker
of Modoc County, who responded to
the toast, "Our Countrj'," said he
hoped the Democrats of California
will send men without shackles to
the national convention
Superior Judge Murasky's response
to "California" was the oratorical gem
of the lot. He drew a beautiful word
picture of early mission life, and said

future of the State, he declared, rests
not upon her material wealth but upon
the moral quality of her men.
Louis Metzger read a number of tele
grams and letters of regret sent by
prominent Democrats, and among them
was a communication from one Fred
Williams, who stated he was in Boston
working in the political interests of
W. R. Hearst, and asked for informa
tion as to Mr. Hearst's chances of get
ting the California delegation to
the Democratic National Convention
pledged to his support. "I ask this
confidentially," added Mr. Williams,
and Mr. Metzger respected the confi
dence thus placed in him by reading
the entire epistle right out in meeting.
Among the other toasts responded to
were "Washington," by Jessie W.
Bryan; "Democracy," by Dr. R. V.
Day, and "Iroquois Club," by .William
M. Cannon. President W. H. Kline de
livered the address of welcome.
Body Recovered From Bay.
' The body of an unidentified man
V as taken out of the bay yesterday
afternoon at the intersection of Fifth
and Channel streets. It had been in
the water several days. The corpse
is that of a man about 40 years of
age and fairly well dressed. It does
not look like that of a laborer. On
the person were found a cover of a
bank book of the San Francisco Sav
ings Union, a tag of the Pearl Oyster
House with the number 368 written
on it and a newspaper clipping con-
taining an advertisement of the Union
Packing and Provision Company, 152
Third street. The corpse is that of
a man about five feet eight inches tall
and very stout.
Snatched Watch and Chain.
Harry Winters was arrested last
night by Patrolman Max Fenner and
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of grand larceny. As Alfred Siebe, a
bartender employed at the Ahlborn
House, was coming out of the saloon
situated at the corner of Belden place
and Bush street shortly after mid
night" Winters grabbed Siebe's watch
and chain, valued at $50, and took to
his heels. Patrolman Fenner was at
tracted by the outcry and gave chase.
Winters was apprehended on 1 Mont
gomery street, but denied that he had
committed any crime. When searched
at the City Prison the watch was
found In his pocket, together with a
choice collection of skeleton keys.
Girl Takes Poison.
Lillian Turner, a young woman liv
ing at 15 J^ Moss street, who claims
to have been employed as a chorus
girl at Fischer's, swallowed a half
ounce of larkspur tincture yesterday
with, suicidal intent. She said she was
despondent and, having the drug in
her possession, decided to end her life.
She was taken to the Emergency Hos
pital, where the stomach pump was
used. At Fischer's Theater nothing*
is known of the girl, although it is
said she may have worked there un
der some other name.
SIX GO DOWN
IN A WRECK
Three-Masted Schooner Benja
min C. Cromwell Founders
Off Coast Xear New York
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â Six men, in
cluding Captain Harvey McLean and
Mate John McComber, were lost to-day
in the wreck of the three-masted
schooner Benjamin C. Cromwell off this
port." Two men of the eight on board
came ashore on bits of wreckage and
were taken to the life-saving station.
The Benjamin C. Cromwell was a
Portland, Me., schooner from Charles
ton, S. C, for Halifax, with pine. At
tempt after, attempt of the life-savers
to reach the wreck was unsuccessful. ,
â  An unknown three-masted schooner
went ashore near Long JBeach, N. J.,
and' began to break up almost imme
diately under the blows of the heavy
breakers. The" fog and the heavy seas
made ' the work of the life savers ex
tremely difficult. Time after time they
Were, hurled back to the beach. The
guns were trained on the wreck just
as the fog closed in more thickly, hiding
the vessel from view. However, the
life savers, having the direction,; shot
the first line at the vessel. Several
other lines were discharged within the
next half-hour, but with what effect it
has not yet been learned. Several
pieces of wreckage had floated ashore,
.which led to 'the fear that the vessel
was breaking ud.

ATLANTIC CITT. N. J.. Feb. 22.-*-
After battling with heavy seas for sev

seven members of the crew of the
three-masted schooner Oliver T. Whit
tier, lumber laden, from Fernandina,
Fla., for New York, were rescued by
the life-saving crew of the Long
Beach life-saving station. The vessel
went ashore sixteen miles north of
Atlantic City. A heavy storm was
raging and the crew had to cling to
the rigging to save themselvegs. When
the fog lifted the life-savers, after he

HONOLULU. Feb. 16. â Governor
Sewall of the Island of Guam, com
mander in the United States navy, is
aboard the navy station ship Supply,
which arrived here from Guam on
Sunday evening. Commander Sewall
lies upon a cot, a very sick man.- and
is being hurried to San Francisco to
obtain the be3t medical treatment. He
is 111 with a tropical disorder and the
ailment became so malignant that it
was imperative for him to be removed
to the mainland. The Supply, which
has been at Guam for a year, was or-
dered to transport him.
The vessel left Guam on January 2S.
She experienced fair weather until
within the immediate zone. of the Ha
waiian Islands, when rough weather
was encountered. Several days ago
the Supply got into a heavy swell and
the vessel, caught in the trough, gave
the Governor little comfort. Every
possible aid is given the sick man. but
he is considered very badly off. He is
accompanied by three daughters and
their* governess.

To Keep in Trim.
FT AUHERT PKiaOM TBRHUNB.
[Athletic Expert New Yo; k Evening World.
Author of 'â¢Muscle Buildlr.B. 1 ' Etc.]
<Corrrttf5t. >.. hy Joseph B. Bowles )^
While boxing is, by itself, one of the
finest Imaginable exercise?, and while
It takes the place of all ordinary calis
thenics in developing the body and in
keeping the circulation In good condi
tion, yet the boxer will find that a cer
tain daily routine of exercise, diet, etc.,
will rreatly improve his wind, muscle
end general "boxing form."
It ie my purpose to-day to give sup
plementary hints on boxing and to
outline for you a simple course of ex
ercises, especiaJly adapted as an ad
junct to the manly art. I shall also
prescribe a diet which, while not se
vere, will enable you to avoid foods
that are deleterious to strength and
endurance.
Let me first sketch out your daily
programme of exercise. I shall go on
CHINNING
the supposition that you are a school
boy, and that your time, outside of
school and study hours, Is more or less
your own.
Rise early, at 7 or 7:30 at latest. Go
througrh fifteen minutes of such calis
thenics as I shall describe in this les
son; then take a cold bath. If you
have any heart trouble or If the cold
does not readily gflve place to a glow,
let the bath be slightly warmed. t
Do not stay In the tub longer than
one minute. Then "rub down" with a
rough towel and dress rapidly.
Eat a simple, substantial breakfast,
then take no exercise for at least half
/an hour (an hour would be better),
and, when you go to rchool, walk
thither if possible. If the school is not
more than a mile from your home.Vou
should always walk to and fro. If far
ther, ride part of the way,. leaving the
car a mile from school and walking
the remainder of the distance. When
I speak of walking I do not mean shuf
fling along at a snail's pace, wearing
out the soles of your shoes, stopping to
look in every window, and using no
more energy than will barely suffice to
keep your body in motion. By "walk
ing" I mean stepping out at a four
mile-an-hour gait, lips closed, chest
thrown out, shoulders back, breath
deep. Blow and regular, and muscles
aJert. One mile of such walking will
do you more good than ten miles of
such shiftless ramblings as is gen ;r-
ally implied by the term.
While at school put all thought of
athletics out of your mind and think
only of the work you. are doing. The
"boxing form âjust as a race of n\x
or seven" â¢ miles* would weary and
FOR BACK AND ABDOMEN'.
weaken a race horse trained for a one
mile run.
only part of your boxing knowledge
you need carry into the schoolroom is
that, which teaches you not to sit
crouched over your desk In cuch a way
as to cramp the lungs and to give the
eyes a wrong focus.
On leaving school walk a mile home
ward, or to the house of your sparring
partner. There, box three brisk rounds
ef thiee minutes each, with one min
ute's rest between each two, and punch
the bag for three similar rounds with
the same intervals.
Let me impress on you one or two
highly needful points in connection
v. ith these daily boxing bouts:
In the first place never box longer
than three minutes without stopping
for at least one minute's rest. It is
bad for the health and injures the
Do not try any outside exercises dur
ing the afternoon's boxing and bag
punching except that which is com
monly known as "chinning." This con
gifts of seizing with both hands a
trapeze or the cornice over a door and
drawing one's self upward by sheer
strength of arm until" the chin Is on
a level with the hands, then slowly
lowering the body until almost at full
arm's length, and repeat as often as
possible.
The foregoing exercise is good for
wind, muscles and endurance. It is, to
my mind, the only sort of callsthen'.c
work which should accompany the reg
ular boxing hour.
If your daily sparring is done at your
sparring firtner's house and not at
your own be careful on starting home
to wrap up warmly and to move brisk
ly. Many a man has caught a danger
ous cold by exposure to outdoor air too
soon after violent exercise.
In the evening do your studying; then
before going to bed take fifteen min
utes more of the same sort of exer
cise as on rising in the morning. Fol
low this with a cold sponge bath and
rubdown. Never sleep less than nine
hours a night. Ten hours will be still
better. Have enough bed clothes to
keep you comfortable, but no more.
Do not sleep under a mountain of cov
erings. The room must be well ven-
tilated; the pillow not too high.
I will now outline for you the form
of morning exercise. Before I begin,
however, let me warn you that, unless
you intend to continue this work per
manently and regularly, it will be bet-
ter for you not to begin at all.
When first you get out of bed, strip,
lie fiat on your back, and then with
arms folded across your chest raise
yourself toward a sitting posture. This
exercises the muscles of back and ab
domen,' two very important sets of
muscles for a boxer, and helps to build
the "plate" of muscular tissue which
should protect the stomach from solar
plexus blows. Do not rise entirely to
a sitting posture, but when there is
an angle of about 75 degrees between
your back and trie floor sink back again
and do it once more. The old-time
athletic instructors made their pupils
rise to a sitting posture, forgetting that
when a certain point is passed the back
and stomach muscles are no longer ex
ercised, but the strain then comes on
the base of the spine. Such a strain
is very Injurious and does not strength
en* the would-be athlete in any way.
Repeat this "sitting up" exercise five
times the first morning:, doing it one
more time each day until you get to
twenty. Then continue to do it twenty
times a day and no more. While going
through this evolution keep the heels
and knees together and the legs rigid.
Next stand up, put the heels near to
g-ether, stand on the ball of the foot
and. keeping the upper part of the body
rigid, bend the knees, sinking down as
far as possible. Never sjnk down so

far, however, that you. cannot recover
yourself and rise again to full height.
Lower and raise yourself thus five
times the first day, increasing the num
ber dally by one until you get up to
The foregoing exercise not only
strengthens and limbers the legs, but is
also excellent for the balance, thus
proving of direct use to all boxers. Be'
Fure to keep the heels off the ground, '
bearing all the weight of the body~on
the ball of the foot. Do not let the
weight of the body become shifted too
far forward or back, as this will not
only tend to throw you off your bal
ance, but will render the exertion of
rising much more difficult
Now stand again at full height as be
fore, legs together, but with feet flat on
the floor. Hold your arms above your
head. Bend forward, holding the lower
half of the body as rigid as possible,
letting the "hinge" come at the small of
the back. Bend as. far as possible to
the front; then, recovering yourself,
bend as far backward as possible in
like manner. This should be done less
quickly than the other exercise, and all
Jerkiness or strain must be avoided. Do
not, when leaning backward, start the
"recovery" with a sharp, snapping mo
tion, as such a move' is liable to Injure
you internally. This forward and back
bending gives suppleness to the body
from the waist up and strengthens the
muscles needed in the "recover" and
"rally" of a boxing bout. Do It five
times at first, increasing to twenty at
the rate of one a day.
Next stand as before and, keeping all
the rest of the body rigid, rise on the
tees as high as possible. Do this twen-
ty times a day from the first.
Bend forward (without lifting the
arms) and try to touch the ground in
front of you with the fingers of both
hands., Do not bend the knees in doing
this. Try It ten times a day. It is good
for taking the stiffness out of the knee

SAN FRANCISCO AT THE FAIR.
WITHIN a comparatively short time the St. Louis
Exposition will be open; the date fixed for the
event is rapidly approaching, but as yet there
has been little done toward providing for the special ex
hibit of San Francisco of which so much was heard
some time ago. Up to this time even the money re
quired has not been subscribed, and of course until that
is done nothing definite can be planned, much less
achieved.
The proposed exhibit can hardly be said to have been
a subject of discussion, for every one who has taken
enough interest in it to give.it any attention at all has
greeted it with approval, so that it may be said to have
been undertaken by acclamation. It is evident, however,
that all who have approved it cordially have not sub
scribed iiberally_and promptly, for according to late re
ports the subscriptions fall far short of the amount re
quired to make a proper exhibit. It goes without saying
that the time has come for united action on the subject,
if there is to be action at all. A fund for an exhibit is
not like a fund for a monument; it cannot wait forever,
nor even for years. It is one of the things that must be
provided at once if it is to be provided at all.
Of the importance of making such an exhibit at the
great fair there can be no question. The general ex
hibit of the State will be a display of rural industries,
but there will be nothing in the glowing masses of fruits
and wines and minerals and grains to show to the world
that we have here a great! city, facing the Orient/having
capacity for handling all the commerce that the growing
traffic of the Pacific will demand of its metropolis. That
showing must be made by San Francisco alone, and the
best time and place to make it will be during the coming
summer at the St. Louis Exposition.
in a city of the wealth and population of San Fran
cisco, if every one'docs hte rightful share in upholding
public enterprises for the general good no one will have
to do much. The amount required to make an impres
sive showing of our advantages and our attainments is
not large when the revenues of the city are taken into
consideration. It is a sum that ought to be subscribed
in a single day, and if we could once awaken here the.
civic patriotism that made Chicago and is making Los
Angeles no great urging would be required to get the
subscription within the week.
Every condition of the present, every prospect of the
future, has in it an incentive to enterprise on the. part
of our people. The past year was one of abounding
prosperity, and, the present promises to equal its abun
dance. It is true there has been a dearth of rain during
the early winter montlis, but there is now every reason
to expect spring rains sufficient to fully compensate *for
what had been lacking until the recent storms. The war
in the Orient may mean a loss to the world's trade as a
whole, but it will be a gain to that of this city; so that
even out of the general misfortune we get something of
a benefit. In short, every condition of the times offers
us an opportunity to increase our prestige as a commer
cial center and to augment our advantages. . We shall
be foolish indeed if we neglect to profit by them, and to
omit a good exhibit at St. Louis would be a-'serious
neglect of one of the most promising.
In sending a saucy note to Russia on the serious ques
tion of guarding the Manchurian railway China is sim
ply getting her friends into trouble. As soon as Chinese
neutrality threatens to become a fiction the. peace of the
world is hazarded and danger of international compli
cations becomes a grave reality. We desire the integ
rity of the Flowery Kingdom simply because we fear
the other fellow in the scramble for the fragments.
BUSTING THE ANTI-TRUST LAW.
THE anti-trust law provides certain penalties, in the
form of fines and imprisonment, for the punish
ment of its violators. It is known that the im
prisonment clause in the law gives it the greatest force.
The "criminal trusts," which Mr. William Randolph
Hearst has attacked with all the gallantry of Don
Quixote going up against the windmills, do not fear a
fine. They can pay it. But imprisonment is another
matter. The prospect of going to jail is so unpleasant
that the trust managers lie awake nights studying out
means to get around it.
Hereafter they may l^y them down to sleep all night.
Mr. Hearst, the trust-buster, has at last*; introduced a
bill for -their relief. It provides: "In all convictions oc
curring after the passage of this act for offenses under
said acts to regulate commerce, whether committed be
fore or after the passage of this act for offenses un
der this section, no penalty shall be' imposed on the con
victed party other than a fine prescribed by law, im
prisonment, wherever now. prescribed as a part of the
penalty, being hereby abolished."
The verbiage of the act raises a suspicion that- Mr.
Hearst wrote it s himself. A violation of the law is sub
ject to the penalties fixed by the statute at the time the
offense was committed. Were this not so, many pow
erful offenders would escape penalties by delay of trial
until they could procure the amendment of the statutory
punishment. < ' V^ I
It will be seen that Mr. Hearst's bill applies to the in
terstate commerce law as well as the anti-trust law.
When the interstate^ commerce law was before Con
gress, and later when it was in the courts, the powerful
railroad companies and the trusts objected to /the im
prisonment clause among its penalties. They wanted
only to be fined. The trust and railroad managers dread
the dark, damp atmosphere of the prison. They abhor
the plain and wholesome diet of the common jail, and,
above all, their pride revolts at being classed among the
jailbirds.- /
. Now. why does Mr. Hearst seek to cut out of the law
the only penalty that they fear? Has some' criminal
trust or predatory railway manager taken advantage
his innocence, to" bunko him into identifying his great
and growing name with, the darling desire of the trusts
and j railroads? Why shouldhe begin picking holes in
laws that arc salutary and for public protection? How
many a time and oft has he expressed, in his string of
newspapers, the burning and boiling desire to see the
trust and railroad, magnates behind the bars, meaning
thereby not the bars whereat alcoholic thirst is quenched,
but the common black iron bars of the prison! Then why
does he lift his legislative hand to destroy the only law
that can put them there?
Does he do this to convince "the wealth of the coun
try" that he is a safe man for President, as his papers
have lately been declaring?" Surely it looks that way.
While he is in an amending and merciful mood he might
as well strike our the &ne also and provide that violators
of the law be presented- with -the freedom of the city, for
the fine amounts to nothing. Imprisonment limits the
more flagrant acts against which the law canonizes. When
it is taken out the law is practically repealed, for it is
left without adequate penalty to secure obedience to its
provisions.
A Portland physician, fortified by the many lessons of
experience, has reached the conclusion that in the inevit
able, necessary and beneficial survival of the fittest rum
plays a great and good part by destroying persons in
herently unfit. If the learned .doctor can now suggest
a means by which rum may do its work more quickly we
will rise and call -him blessed. The rumster is slow in
A PROFITABLE CROP.
THE caption at the head of this article is taken from
the Los Angeles Times, which uses it" as a brief
summary of what it has to say about the home
value of the annual tourist travel from Atlantic and
Middle-Western States to Southern California.
While that is truly a commercial way of looking at the
matter there is no doubt that visitors who have money
to spend and'are willing to spend it are welcome- in all
parts of the world. The landlords of Paris, of Switzer
land, of Venice unquestionably regard tourists from the
viewpoint of profit to be derived from their sojourn.
But inasmuch as the storekeeper, the manufacturer, the
land owner and all other classes of citizens of all lands
expect to profit by the stranger within their gates, who
comes other than as a personal guest, there is no reason
for any one to cry out against mercenary considerations.
The winds .blow softly through the orange groves of
California, and such odors as might have charmed the
dreamy dwellers of "Araby the Blessed" or of the Vale
of Cashmere, of which Tom Moore sang so melodiously,
sweeten the air. Where the skies are genial and every
prospect pleases visitors will flock. The Southern Cali
fornia man who directs attention with pride to the at
tractions that lure new people and fresh money into his
vjeinage is no mere mercenary than is the landlord who,
pointing at Mont Blanc as it stands seemingly transfig
ured in ks ineffably beautiful pink mantle of the "Alpine
glow," complacently is aware that the recital by his guest
6i what; he has seen from that particular locality is good
to bring business in the next season
If fhe Alps in their lordly grandeur are "drawing
cards," and the people -who go to see them and to be
housed and spend their money* in the Alpine neighbor
hood .ire the basis of newer buildings, more spacious
hotels .and better facilities for contemplating nature *in a
supreme mood, then California, north and south alikeâ
the land in which latitude is not marked by differences
of temperature to any noticeable extentâ is not to be
spoken of adversely for its* appreciation of advantages it
possesses, nor to be blamed because it avails itself of
them financially.
The theme of profit from Eastern visitors is 1 an old
one. Southern California knows much about the facts.
Central California is to be the field of greater attrac
tions in the future than the southern counties have been
able to afford. Northern California will also have "a
profitable crop" of tourists. Great hotels are soon to be
opened in this city to make life pleasant for the winter
sc'.< timers from the East and from all portions of the
world, who will find here the conditions they desire
when seeking to escape from the rigors of less hospitable
climes and at the same time have all the attractions that
the metropolis of the Pacific Coast with its charming en
virons can supply for their beguilement.
The people of Southern California have found it good
to have a profitable crop. They' are advocating easy
grade roads to mountain summits, well watered high
ways in all directionsâ all the comforts that can be de
vised, in brief, to. hold the tourists. Northern Califor
nia, and the fact cannot be too often urged, nepds also
to care for. the comfort of tourists, to not only give them
what they ask, but also to anticipate liberally their wants
and to make life so pleasant to them while they are in
this region they will advertise it favorably all over the
St. Petersburg has canceled its censorship -upon war
news emanating from the Russian capital. This recom
mends itself as a correct policy. When the whole world
knows are in a bad fix why not earn a reputation for
graciousness by admitting the fact? Besides, St. Peters
burg has simply become an accident bureau for the re
port of. blundering bobbies in the art pi war. '
AN OFFENSIVE STATUTE.
IS everything to become the subject of statutory regu
lation? Is all grace and garnish to be banished to
conform to the merely external^ form provided by
an act entitled an act? The Virginia Legislature pro
poses to compel by law circus posters to tell the truth,
and nothing but the truth!
Are the people to be deprived of the pleasures of tne
many colored circus poster by bringing" it down to the
dead level of mere facts? Arc we to read no more of
"the only greatest show on earth. The combined com
binations and aggregated aggregations of the Princes
of the ring, the Empresses of the equescurriculum and
the only wonders of wonders now on the road"? Are we
to part with the pleasures of the imagination, and see it
ali brought down to a statement that men and women
will ride around a -ring?
The proposed law applies to the pictures as well as
the text. We are to see the circus ladies pictured as
plain as they are, and not as prize-winners in, a world
beauty show. We will have none of such a law. Life
requires every possible diversion from its hard duties
and various vexations. And now. just as the traveling
shows havc.decidcd to omit the street parade, the cold
and unfeeling law of the land proposes to stretch- forth
and tear from the circus poster its beauty and- style.
In the great name of theorising generation, we file a
protest thus/ far ill advance of the next session oi"thz
California Legislature, lest this more than Puritan prop
osition gain a foothold here. W^miM
King Edward; late in his conscior ness of s 'an over
sight of churlish Ministers, has bestowed upon Lord
Roberts tardy commendation and reluctant praise. Lord
Roberts ha's been .before a- world's audience, where a
.King's favor counts for no more than that of ah atom in
the 'multitude.' "Bobs" has made history in which his
sovereign plays but an incidental part.
' Russia has decided that under the exigencies of war
she must abandon her proposed representation at the
St. Louis Exposition. She is at present fully occupied
in blowing up her. own ships and defeating herself as
surely and as inevitably, by stupid blundering as if she
were an- active ally of her enemy.
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Missed Mother.
A few rights ago, when the rain was
coming down in torrents and a bit
terly cold wind was blowing:, a little
boy- who could not have been more
than eight years of age walked into
the insane ward at the Central Emer
gency Hospital. He was dren rhed to
the skin and shivering and shaking eo
that the kind hearted matron who wrs
on duty rushed him toward tha big
stove, stripped off his rain soaked far
ments, wrapped him up in':, heavy
woolen blanket and then gave him a
steaming hot cup of coffee and a hu&e
slice of bread.
"What in the world, you poor llttla
dear," she said, pressing him close to
her, "are you doing out in this storm?"
"I want my mamma," sobbed the lit
tle fellow, putting his arms around the
nurse's neck. A>?& '
"What's your. mamma's name?" ask
ed the nurse.
"Wilson," cried the boy.
And then the nurse remembered. A
week before the Lunacy Commission
had sent to Agnew a woman named
Wilson. She remembered also that
Mrs. Wilson was the mother of a large
family and that when she was commit
ted one of the children, the little fellow
she how held in her arms, had at first
tearfully refused to leave the hospital
with his father and his brothers and
sisters.
The Puzzle Solved.
On Friday last The Call published in
these columns the following delightful
mathematical puzzle, offering as a
prize to the one flying farthest from
the answer a nice second-hand copy
of "Differential Calculus":
Five men were allowed to share a
box of oranges among them. John took
10. Robert 20, George 30, Richard 40
and William 50.
"What an unfair division!" said the
donor, as the men carried the oranges
"Not at all." they replied. "The
numbers make no difference. We shall
sell at the same rate, and if we sell out
shall have exactly the same money
each. â¢ .
They sold out, and each took exactly
the same sum. How did it happen?
It was our opinion that the answer
was "two apple?," but an enterprising
subscriber has thought differently,
thereby winning the nice second-hand

IV here Conventions Meet.
One of the public buildings of which
Kansas City is justly proud is the Con
vention Hall. The present building oc
cupies the site of the former building
of the same general dimensions, which
was destroyed. by fire on April 4, 1900.
The Democratic National Convention
was to meet in this building on July
4 of the same year, and this now
seemed almost an impossibility. Be
fore the flames were distinguished on
the old building, however, a new one
had been pledged, contracts made and
in less than ninety days from the date
of the fire the new Convention Hall
stood on the site of the old qne, a fire
proof building, 198x314 feet, with a seat
ing capacity of more than 20,000 per
sons, under a steel roof which spanned
the whole without a column and at a
cost of $230,000.
The Democratic Convention was
opened on the Fourth of July, 1900, in
a building belonging to the same class
as the Madison Square Garden in New
York and which lacked very little- of
completion. Its exterior is cut stone
and . brick, its interior fire-proof
throughout and its floor area larger
than that of Madison Square Garden.
The architect of the general building
was F. E. Hill, who made the pla#s
for the second building, with the assist
ance of an advisory board of architects.
The achievement, from purely a con
structional point of view, was one of
the most, remarkable wnich has ever

After deliberation and. nu
merous conferences, the officials of the
St. Louis exposition , have decided
against, the, ragtime' song, c-r even tho
ragtime music without words to ac
company it. The musical director of
the exposition and the chairman of the
musical programme have Issued an
edict that all songs, either, In the State
pavilions. Festival Hall or along the
pike, shall be strictly classical and
modern 1 if possible, but all elements of
the ragtime music hall style of singing
shall be eliminated.
"I have no personal feeling of en
mity against ragtime," says the musi
cal director, "but I think too much of
it is a bad thing. I believe the people
like good music. There are many beau
tiful and. popular selections from the
classics. Because music can" be called
classic does not 'necessarily Imply that
if' should be heavy or generally unat
tractive.,.: Some of , the most popular
music of to-day is the lighter music of
the classics.'"
The chairman of the musical pro
gramme says that one reason the rag
time tune was, eliminated from the ex-
position was that, like the measles, the
air that Is given sentiment In these
tunes seems contagious, and the people
would %vish for nothing else once ins
ragtime tunes began.
The decision of the exposition offi
cials to exclude ragtime has created
a furor along the pike, where it had
been arranged to have some very new
and up-to-date songs with a ragtimi
air about them. The rlke concession
aires have held a meeting and have

CONFESSION
Police Find That the Two
3Ien Arrested for Recent
Robberies in Marin County
Are Experienced in Crime
AUSTIN HOOPER WELL
BEARED AT PETALUMA
Officers Have Learned That
Wilson Left San Quentin a
Week Ago, but the Prisoner
Will Not Discuss His Past
SAX RAFAEL. Feb. 22.â The career
of Austin Hooper has been one of
J crime for the past several years. His
I latest offense, the attempt to murder
Constable Louis Hughes and the sub
! sequent holding up of William Shan-'
j non and his customers last night, will,
from all facts thus far brought to
light. land him behind prison bars for
the balance of his life, likewise his
pal, George Wilson. Of Wilson little
is known other than that he has a
i prison record and that he- only left
I San Quentin last Monday morning.
J Hooper is the son of Mrs. C. T.
j Hooper of Petaluma. He was reared
I by indulgent parents, but at an early
j age developed many criminal instincts.
| He was in one Reform School fo'r sev
'â¢ eral years and on March IS, 1903, was
: sent to Sari Quentin from Rolano
j County for one year for assault with
' a deadly weapon upon Constable Jo
* seph Statton of Dixon. Hooper upon
j leaving San Quentin told Captain
j Swan that he was going home to his
! mother in Petaluma and lead a good
j life. No soonrr had the young man
I left the prison than he evidently
i planned the holdup in Sausalito which
! was successfully carried out on last
; Friday night. On this occasion he was
J joined by George Wilson, who helped
j him in the work at San Rafael last
night. The two men were arrested by
Deputy Sheriff George Martin at San
Anselmo about 1 o'clock this morning.
Several posses were out scouring the
country in search of them. Sheriff
j Taylor and Deputy Agnew were out!
j al! night searching the country in the
direction of Nova to. Many clews were
run down, but no tangible evidence of â¢!
the whereabouts of the fugitives could
be developed.
HOOPER IS WOUXDKD.
| Had it not been that Hooper was se
i verely wounded in the leg and could
not travel, the two men would probably j
have been at large yet. How the '
wound was received is a mystery yet j
unsolved. Hughes asserts during his ;
combat with the two men about 10:15
he attempted to fire, but his revolver .
snapped each time. Â» j
When the two men entered the Shan
non saloon the taller of the two did not
limp. Hence the belief is that the two
men. after they left Shannon's, at- ;
tempted another hold-up en route to
San Anselmo and Hooper got hit. â¢
After being wounded the two went to
the residence of James Taylor. Deputy
Sheriff Martin was there at the time
and nabbed his men. later bringing
them to the County Jail here. At 3
o'clock this morning Shannon positive- .
ly identified the two as the ones who '
rubbed him. Hughes also was positive
the smaller man. Wilson, shot him.
Later to-day Sausalito people who
were held u?> Friday night identified
Wilson, while Joseph Kelly of San Ra
fael was certain that Hooper was the
lad that hired a horse and buggy from ,
his stable on Saturday afternoon and â¢
has never returned it. j
Wilson would not- speak upon the
subject at all, while -Hooper told vari- j
ous stories establishing alibisi
BOTH MlfiX O6XFES& j
This afternoon, however, under a
sweating by District Attorney Boyd
and Sheriff Taylor, Hooper told his
name and admitted the Sausalito hold
up. Wilson confessed to having tried
to kill Hughes, claiming he believed
that the officer was after him. The
evidence against the two prisoners for
four charge? of highway robbery is
conclusive and it !s believed they will
soon make a clean breast of all their
infamous .conduct in Marin County.
Austin Hooper, though only 20 years
old, is an old hand at highway robbery.
Several years ago he stole a bicvele in
Dixon and was arrested by Constable
Joseph Statton. Later he shot Statton
and made his escape. He purloined
another bicycle and rode to Tremont,
there held up two men and relieved
them of considerable coin. He was next
heard of at Webster station, where he
held up another man and shot his vic
tim. He doubled back on his tracks
and eluded pursuit for some time, but
ultimately was located at the home of
his parents in 'Petaluma, He was ar
rested, tried and eventually got the
charge reduced to one of assault. He
arrived at. San Quentin March 18, 1903.
His number there was 20039. Hooper
also has relatives in Oakland. The
preliminary hearing will occur to-mor-
RAIN DELUGES HONOLULU
AND DOES GREAT DAMAGE
Storm. 'of a Week's Duration Endan
gers Roads and Bridges and Causes
n Loss of $100,000.
HONOLULU, Feb. 16.â A storm
which has broken all records here for
rainfall began a week ago last Sat
urday, since which date over twenty
inches of rain have fallen here. It is
estimated that "damages to the extent
of $100,000 have been done to roads
and bridges in the islands, the dam
age in Honolulu being estimated at
over $50,000. For a time the shore
line cable, connecting San Francisco
with the offices of the cable company
here," was , endangered by the washing
away of a bridge. The company had
instruments ready_ in their small sta
tion on the beach' in case of a break
and was ready. to pick up. the line and
continue receiving and sending mes

BAD WEATHER
IS A DAMPER
Washington's Birthday Cele
bration Checked by a Down
pour of Bain Throughout Day
BUSINESS HOUSES CLOSED
Sons of the American Revolu
tion and Other Organiza-
tions Observe â¢ the Occasion
Leaden skies and a drizzly downpour
of water effectively prevented any out
door celebration of Washington's birth
day in San "Francisco. So muggy was
the weather that the usual work-a-day
crowd was absent from the street's.
Some men and women wrapped in rain
j ccats and sheltered by umbrellas wan
idered. forth to watch the flags on the
I principal business blocks, hanging de-
I jectediy under the rain that came down
! in slanting lines.
I All of the principal business houses
j closed in honor of the day, and the era
i ployes enjoyed the holiday generally by
! stopping at home in the comfort of a
grate fire. Late in the afternoon the
â  rain ceased, and as a' consequence the
â¢ theaters heljf their usual holiday
j crowds. j
j There were absolutely no outdoor ex
ercises in honor of the great liberator.
Even the customary exercises before
j United States troops were foregone at
! the Presidio. The parade ground was
I an inland sea, and the commanding of
; fleer thought it would be an imposition
on the soldiery to compel the commands'
( to stand ankle deep in water and listen
j to "Washington's Farewell Address."
: SONS OF KKVOT.UTION DIXK.
I The Sons of the American Revolu- i
I tion celebrated Washington's bjrth- !
j day last night in the California Hotel
j at an informal dinner, at which Col- j
': onel A. D. Cutler, president of the so- j
j ciety, presided.
j Colonel Cutler reported that the Na
tional Society will probably hold its
I annual convention in San Francisco in
. the spring of 1905. A paper was read
i by M. Sims on "Washington, the Mak- i
' ing of the Man." in which he traced !
i the effects of Washington's early pur
psuit3 and environment upon the form-
S ation of his character. The paper was
â discussed by George C. Sargent, C. J. i
I King, Charles E. Greene and C. D. I
i Haven. i
j The society was also entertained by j
j General C. A. Woodruff, U. S. A., who j
I spoke of Washington and compared i
! him with the politicians of the pres
ent day.
The next meeting of the society will |
be on April 1!>, the anniversary of the I
I battle of Lexington, at which time a |
formal dinner will be given. Ladies j
| will be invited.
CLUB AT THE ALHAMBRA!
In the evening entertainments in
honor of the Father- of â¢ his Country
were' also given' by the Young Men's
j Institute at the Alhambra Theater
'and by the Pi Psi Sigma Club at the
-Young Men's Christian Association
auditcrrium.
: The Alhambra Theater was comfort
ably filled, despite the rain, with a well- j
( dressed and appreciative audience, j
which listened attentively to the pro- j
gramme rendered. John A. Dunleavy, '
president of the board of management .
j of the â¢ Young Men's Institute, made ,
some introductory remarks, outlining !
the purposes and achievements Qf the!
border. Joseph S. Tobin was the princi- j
pal sneaker of the evening, and the I
burden of his address was patriotism. !
He^dwelt at length on the services ren- |
dered to our country in war and peace â 
by Catholics, and impressed on his '
hearers the fact that the members of!
the Young Men's Institute were no less '
'â  ardent than were their forebears, who
\ had fought, died and helped build the
magnificent structure of the greatest
nation the world has ever known.

By Sally Sharp-
Colonial days were not mere things
of memory last nightâ the birthnight
of Washingtonâ for at Century Hall
the Pacific Coast Women's Press As
sociation held forth in ye garb of ye
olden day, and Priscilla, Penelope and
their other quaint compatriots were as
one with us of the later day. But we,
in our new-fangled garb, were simply
not in the runningâ as the racing men
would sayâ with their flowered bro
cades, their kerchiefs and panniers,
their powdered wigs and patches.
The reception committee, Mrs. Ada
Van Pelt chairman, was gowned in
the style of our -Revolutionary gran
dames, Airs. Hall, Mrs. Foster, Miss
, Gleason and Dr. JMlnora Kibbe look

! ered frocks. .

j Gleason; Mistress Lorena Klizabeth Hoag \vifl

ye corner.
N. B.â Inasmuch as ye maydens do be
shamefaced before so many people, ye goode
folke are asked to look ye other way.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The harpsichord "solo was a charm
ing initial number. Mr. Tillson giving
j the "Gondolier Song," by Liszt, and a
j medley of patriotic airs in good style.
| Mr. Olney's numbers, sung in cos
tume,' were very charming, the second
song reflecting rather better taste per
! haps in selection than the first. .
j Miss _Gleason's" solos were excellently
i received, and deservedly so. So, too,
! were the "pieces spoke" by the chic
little Miss Hoag and the whistling solos
of Miss Ludlow.
The Virginia reel, by the guests, was
| unquestionably the real thing in the
j way of reels, which was supplemented
i by the "Quaker's Greeting." Don't
j know what that is? Neither did we,
| whe-se forebears weren't in the May-'
, flower excursion, but Mrs. Ada Van
i Pelt explained its intricacies and a !
very jolly time resulted. '
America was then sung, and sung '
I with a fine ring of patriotism, and the
J well beloved but much battered "Auld
! Lang Syne" announced the programme
at an end. .,
The' coffee and crullers were espc- '
daily good, made by a writer member
who really can cook. . |
The following notice about contribu- ',
tic-ns is apropos:
NV B. â Ye goode people need not brynjre gin- i

I coffee and crullers for all ye men and women.

crumbs on ye floor.
X. B. â Inasmuch as ye meeting-house la '
lyghted by ye new-fans;Ied thynge called gas, i
goode people need rot brynge candles.
Thus did the spirit of '76 hover about \
the home of the Women's Press Club, j
and right worthily was the birthday of j
Washington honored by its members
and friends. And those crullers made;
by a member will survive as" a pleasant
memory for many a long day. <
The Outdoor Art League, Mrs. Lovell j
White president, held an important;
meeting yesterday at the Sorosis club- j
house, at which Mrs. Willis Polk made j
the principal address. The matter of
keeping vacant lots clear of garbage
and rubbish was the topic under dis
cussion, and from the earnestness of
the members good results must ensue.
To-day the California Club will hold
an interesting session, the day being in
charge of Mrs. Louis Hertz. "The
Ghetto" will be the topic of discussion.
Sixteen members of the California
Women's Whist League have organized
a little club for the purpose of bowling
on Wednesday and Saturday after
noons of each week. Mrs., Eugene Duf
fey. the popular vice president of the
California Whist League, will probably
accept the presidency of the new club.
Among the bowling enthusiasts who
will bowl in Mrs. Duffey's party are:
Mrs. W. A. Richardson, Mrs. E. B.

McCartney, Mrs. O'Brien and Mrs. Joy.
The Tuesday Afternoon Club enjoyed
an informal bowling party on its regu
lar day last week. The ladies bowled
from 2 to 4 o'clock, and Bfter the game
enjoyed a dainty luncheon. Among those
present were* Mrs. H. M. Breeden, Mrs.
J. S. Andrews, Mrs. C. Sharrocks, Miss
Giesting and Mrs. Butler.
SHOWERS ARE FREQUENT.
Central and Northern California Get
Slight Rainfall., .
Showers were frequent in Central
and Northern California yesterday. No
rain fell in the south, where it is most
needed. Local Forecaster Willson said
last night that" the storm w-as making
its way east and that this State would
see but little more of it. Clearing
weather generally is the prediction for
to-day. \
..The temperature was higher, than
for. several days previously. The
winds were .light off shore. Under
present conditions there 'is no unusual
danger for" the shipping interests.
The amount of rain that fell in this
city during Sunday and yesterday was
.46 of an inch. The seasonal rainfall
Is about five inches less than the aver-
age. ' /
Snow was falling, in the higher alti
tudes last night. The rivers in the
northern^portion of the State were ris
ing* slowly, but there is no danger of
an overflow, at any point according to

for years and claims to have effected
some remarkable cures. He is a home
opath and says that there is nothing
strange about his cure, excepting that
he believes he is the first one to try
homeopathy on the disease.
The Board of Health intends to give
the remedy a thorough test. For that
purpose a camp has been established a
couple of miles from Hilo and patients
will be sent there to take the treatment.
The Government bacteriologist. Dr. Mc-
Donald, will assist in making the test
successful. President Cooper has ap
pointed a commission, composed of Drs.
Grace, Hays and Rice, to note the con

will be prolonged so long as the doctors
in attendance believe it necessary f ( >r

CONGREGATION SHERITH ISRAEL LAYS
CORNERSTONE OF SPLENDID TEMPLE
Hundreds of Members and Friends of the Prosperous Hebrew
Society Brave the Storm to Participate in Impressive Cere
monies Conducted by Rabbi Nieto â Details of the Enterprise
Five hundred members and friends
of Congregation Sherith Israel showed
their devotion to their ancient faith
yesterday afternoon by braving the
Storm to attend the ceremonies of the
laying of the cornerstone of the new
?yna?ogue on the northeast corner of
California and Webster streets. The
.meeting was held under a temporary
..awning stretched over the foundation
and basement structure.
The president of the congregation,
Charles Harris, opened the exercises
with a short address of greeting to the
members present from that and other
synagogues. He dwelt upon the re
markable progress made by the con
gregation in its rifty-four years of pros
-perous histo-y and the encouraging
outlook fÂ«r the future in its new loca
.tion. He was followed by Rabbi Meyer
:S. Levy in an invocation, asking the
c!i\ine blessing upon the rising house
â¢of .worship, and by Rabbi M. Fried-
Umder in a reading from the Scrip- j
' tUFOS.
The old box of records that had been
placed in the cornerstone of the congre
gation's present synagogue at Post ana
Taylor streets when it was dedicated,
on August 26, 1870, was then laid by |
Hal-.r f heideman, chairman of the I
Uuildkig committee, in the new corner- i
etone. Among other contents it held â 
copies of the Alta ("alifnrnian and
other contemporary newspapers of that
date.
HISTORICAL SKETCH
â¢ An historical sketch of Congregation
Fherith Israel was read by Secretary
Alexander L. Badt. He told of the
foundation of the society by three He
brews from Kartern cities, who, in the

thousands of cases of inflamma-

RAEL, AND SCENE AT THE
CORNERSTONE LAYING.
summer of 1S19, prepared for the cele
bration of the Jewish holidays here in
September by erecting a temporary
structure at what was then the end of
Kearny street, where now stands the
Commercial Hotel. The fact that money
was more abundant then than build
ing materials or buildings was vividly
brought out by the historian's state
ment that for the use of this building
during the holidays alone the embryo
congregation had to pay the extraor
dinary sum of $1000. The next year,
said Mr. Badt, the congregation effect
ed a regular organization on August
20. Its first home was in rooms in a
building known as "Merchants' Court,"
on Washington street, between Mont
gomery and Kearny. The great fire of
1851 destroyed this structure and left
the congregation to seek new quarters
in rooms on Kearny street, between
Washington and Jackson. The first
synagogue was erected in 1854, and was
dedicated on September 8 of that year.
It stood on the east side of Jackson
street, between Broadway and Vallejo.
This humble structure of frame shel
tered the congregation until 1870, when
the large temple at Post and Taylor
streets wan dedicated. The growth of
the congregation and the removal of
its membership farther west had made
a change of location and a still larger
synagogue necessary, the steps taken
to obtain which were told at some
length.
PAYS WAltM TRIBUTE.
The historian paid a warm tribute
to the former rabbis and lay officers of
the congregation, whose long devotion
to its interests had built it up from a.
feeble organization with few members
to one of the most prosperous Jewish
societies in the country and made it
able to undertake the erection of the
coming magnificent synagogue, an or
nament to the city and a pride to its
members. i
Rev. Jacob Nieto, the rabbi of Sher
lth Israel, in a short but most feeling
address presented a silver trowel, the
gift of the congregation, to President
Harris, who was about to perform the
final act that had brought the com
pany together. Rabbi Nieto said in
part:
"We have selected for our corner
stone laying the natal day of that
great man that laid the cornerstone of
the most magnificent nation in the
world's history. The difficulties we
have met in building this congregation
and synagogue are, as nothing to the
heroic labors of the father of our land.
Let us remember his example and
build not for ourselves, but for poster
ity and country, for faith and free-
dom."
Architect Albert Pissis having certi
fied that all arrangements had been
made for the completion of the edifice,
President Harris called upon the vice
president of the congregation, Henry
Roman, to prepare the new box to be
deposited in the cornerstone with con
temporary records. This was duly
sealed, Its contents including copies of
the leading Hebrew and secular pa
pers, by-laws _ of all the San Francisco
congregations and charitable societies
of that faith and much other matter
of interest to the members of Sherith
h>rael.. * - .
A copy of the great American petl-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY. 23. 1901.
tion to the Czar of Russia in behalf of
his Jewish subjects was one of the
most noteworthy articles in the box.
There were also a copy of the consti
tution of the United States and a num-
ber of coins of current use.
Meyer Davidson, the senior member
of the congregation, placed the box of
records in position beneath the mas
sive cornerstone, which hung suspend
ed from a derrick, and which was then
slowly lowered into its final resting
place. "I now declare this stone duly
and truly laid," proclaimed President
Harris, "and may heaven prosper our
efforts and grant us the reward of our
labors and enable us all to see the
completion of the superstructure."
Just as the cornerstone descended
into its place the sun, which had been
hidden all the afternoon behind the
clouds and rain, broke through the dark
sky and shone bright and clear for a
few minutes upon the impressive scene.
It was accepted as a good omen for
the future of the new temple and its
congregation
The closing address by Rabbi Jacob
Voorsanger, D. D., of Congregation
Emanu-El, on Sutter street, was an
eloquent tribute to the work of his
fellow Hebrews of the Sherlth Israel
and it aroused hearty applause by its
references to the land where so many
Hebrews have found welcome and pros
perity. Dr. Voorsanger said among
other things:
EMANU-EL'S GREETINGS.
"Greetings from Emanu-El oh the
auspicious beginning of a holy work.
This rain to-day that blesses the earth
is a symbol of God's blessing upon a
dry and thirsty land. As it drenches
the soil, so shall the religion of Israel
drench and blesp this country and all
the countries of the world. We in
voke the symbol of the rain that this
faith may give spiritual prosperity to
our descendants for all future time.
"We lay this cornerstone believing
that the inspirations of our faith are
just as dear to us in this great, free
land as In those Oriental countries
where our forefathers struggled in cen
turies long agone. The civil loyalty of
the Jew is only matched by his loy
alty to Israel and to his own home and
family/'
The benediction was pronounced by
Rabbi Isidore Myers of Congregation
Ohabai Shalome.
The new synagogue, the massive
foundations of which have already been
completed, will be pushed rapidly for
ward, and it is the hope of Rabbi Nieto
and his parishioners that they may
be able to worship in the finished tem
ple during the Jewish holidays in Sep
tember. Their present synagogue at
Post and Taylor streets njay have to
be vacated upon short notice, as it has
been sold
The structure that is rising tot, the
growing congregation at California and
Webster streets will be one of
the finest pieces of ecclesiasti
cal architecture in San Fran
cisco. Planned in the" general style
adopted by the leading Hebrew socie
ties of the world, it will attract praise
by reason of the especially imposing
features of the facade and by great at
tention to interior convenience and
beauty. The building will cover a plat
128x100 feet. Its material is gray 'sand
stone.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â The declina
ticm of the honor of. serving, on the
Panama Canal Commission came along
In due form to-day, signed by J\jdge
Garber, as was expected. President
Roosevelt, in discussing the matter
with members of the 'California delega
tion later, intimated . that his next
selection -from that State for theroffia?
would probably b.e - from the ranks of
engineers.
The action of the President in offer
ing the appointment to Judge Garber
is probably responsible for a move on
the part of the California delegation
looking to the getting together of that
body in the matter .of distribution of
State patronage that will be productive
of excellent results. It isViot too much
to say that the nomination of Judge
Garber, while not criticized in the mat
ter of the nominee, struck the Cali
fornia Senators like a thunderclap from
a sunny sky. It is explained by the
fact that the Senators were not united
on any man acceptable to the President
and for that reason-he sought the ad-
Vice of representative men outside of
the deleg-ation altogether. This j divi
sion of sentiment and influence has
worked to the disadvantage of Cali
fornia Republicans aspiring to Federal
office in many instances, some of which
are notable, as well as to the great
embarrassment of members of the dele
gation themselves. The result has been
that where the President has not taken
the matter out of -the hands of the
delegation entirely, making his own
choice, the appointment otherwise to
have been made is simply held up.
SENATORS CLAIM POWER.
This matter has been a source of con
stant irritation to the Californiahs for
a long time and often the subject of
discussion among them. The Senators
have hitherto j claimed exclusive right
to name candidates for Federal offices
other than postmasterships in the sev
eral legislative districts. Where the
Senators each had candidates for any
single office and failed to come together
the delegation in the House has been
appealed to to serve as a jury and
render judgment.
The members of the House, however,
have respectfully declined to offer their
good offices at any such disagreeable
juncture. It is not for them, they say,
to judge between the Senators. If they
are to be consulted by the Senators
when they are in a dilemma they, the !
Representatives," insist .upon having
some 6ay in a clear field. The Sena
tors claim the right to the distribu
tion of patronage on the ground, that
it falls to them to secure the confirma
tion of the nominees. By this same
sign, say the Representatives, .they
must be held responsible for every act
of the officer appointed upon their ex
clusive motion.
But the system has failed to work
anything but failure, and the Senators
and Representatives alike have real
ized how it has weakened their effec
tiveness both here and at home in Cali
fornia.
Whether or not it was the Judge
Garber incident that brought the mat
ter to a head, Senator Bard to-day
1 submitted to Senator Perkins, and after
a slight amendment by the latter both
Senators submitted to the House dele
gation, a proposition calculated to clear
the sky, bringing about harmony and
work the much desired reform.
DELEGATION FORMS PLAN,
Briefly stated, it is that the whole
delegation shall decide who shall be
proposed for the Federal offices inv Cali
fornia. This was the proposition of
Senator Bard. Senator Perkins' only
stipulation was that the nominee in no
case should be o-bjectlonable to either
Senator. The proposition in writing
was sent to Representative Metcalf,
who will bring it before the other House
members at a meeting to-morrow.
"It will, of course, be accepted," said
Metcalf to-night, "for this is what the |
House delegation has been contending I
for all along. There will, I am sure,
be no objection to the only stipulation
in it, for the reason that no member
of the House would wish to force the
nomination of any man objectionable
to a Senator. We all desire that only
non-objectionable men be given the
Federal offices. 1 ;
The result of this move will prob
ably soon be felt in California official
circles.
HOUSE SHIES AT FAREWELL
, ADDRESS OF WASHINGTON"
Refuses to Listen to the Reading of
First President's Words of
Advice. < 7?
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22. â The low
er Housq of the American Congress
to-day refused to hear the reading of
Washington's farewell address. In
the Senate, following the usual cus
tom on February 22, the address wai
read immediately after the chaplain's
opening prayer.
Williams, the minority leader in the
House, moved that the clerk read the
farewell address of Washington" and
that immediately thereafter the House

Payne was sustained on the ground
that the motion embraced two prop
ositions.
Williams then moved that the
House adjourn and pending adjourn
ment that unanimous consent be given
for the reading of Washington's fare
well address. Having coupled a j re
quest with his motion it again was
held: not to be in order. Then Wil
liams asked for unanimous consent
that, this being Washington's birth
day," the farewell address be read.
Upon the demand of Payne 'â¢ for the
regular order Williams moved to ad
journ. On roll call the motion was
lost, 93 to 95., Three Republicans
voted with the minority for the mo
tion; otherwise there was a party
alignment with the Republicans op

BURTON OPPOSES
GREATER NAVY
Chairman of House River and
Harbor Committee Against
the Appropriation Measure
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â The naval
appropriation bill to-day encountered
opposition on the Republican side of the
House. Burton, chairman of the River
and Harbor Committee, announced in
a vigorous speech that he could not
support a bill which declared that the
United States, which in his view shoulrt
be the leader in all works for peace, is
going to double, treble and quadruple
its naval establishment, all under the
assertion that it is done for peace.
Consideration of the bill was pending
when the House adjourned, twenty-six
of the seventy-three pages having been
read for amendment under the five-
minute rule.
Burton'.' opposed the naval policy ex
pressed in the bill. as a departure from
the Doli<Jy which has been alike the
honor arid bulwark of the country. He
asked what was the necessity of so
great a navy; what nation was threat
ening and what nation was attacking
us, and what nation had questioned
the control of the United States over
the Philippines. Continuing, he asked
what country held back when Panama
broke away from Columbia. Turning
to the Spanish war, he declared there
was ample opportunity for foreign pow
ers to have formed combinations
against the United States if they had
so desired, but no such action had
been taken. The fact is, said Burton,
that the United States does not need a
large navy unless there shall be a com
bination of all Europe with their navies
against this country. - In such an event,
he continued, this country could not
provide a sufficient naval force without
a change that would be absolutely ap
pallingâa change in the social condi
tion.
"We could not build a navy like that
of Great Britain without changing the
whole framework of our society," he
said.
- Burton said the Monroe doctrine Is
in no danger and .that the supremacy
of this country in the western hemis
phere is secure. The Monroe doctrine,
he said, means that republics must
prevail on this side of the 5 earth and.
that the stronger are to protect the
weak. He wanted to know what hob
goblin disturbed the droam of the gren
tleman who feared Germany wonld at-
tack the United States,
-"'The nations of the earth respect us,*'
he said. "They honor tis^ and, so far
as fear is salutary, they fear us."

ARREST CRANK

WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â Edward
Relgar, who gave his address as Chi

to-day and locked up, pending an in
quiry into his mental condition. Rel
gar evidently is of unbalanced mind.
He has written \ many letters to the
President, suggesting that people be
named in accordance with their occu
pations. Thus he maintains that a
dealer in wood should be' named Wood,
a carpenter should be named Carpen
ter, and bo on throughout the list. He
said that the present scheme of nam
ing people has caused a war among
the flies which may be ended only by
the adoption of his suggestion. For
many weeks the Secret Service offi
cers have been on the lookout for him
and when he appeared to-day he was
promptly placed in custody. Relgar
desired to see the President to ascer
tain why his letters had not been ans
wered. When he was searched a load
ed revolver and a box of cartridges
were found in his pockets. The offi
cers had no difficulty in getting him
away from the White House. He was
then taken to police headquarters,
where he \\as turned over to the au
thorities. Relgar ssys he is a miner
and railroad man. He arrived here
Saturday night.

as Those Used in Oakland
POINT RICHMOND, Feb. 22.â The
Richmond East Shore And Suburban
Railway, which was .incorporated, in
Point Richmond last week, has begun
the work of laying its tracks, and the
directors expect that the ro-ad, which
will connect the two portions of the
town and the Southern Paciflc and
Santa Fe depots, will be completed and
in operation by the first of July.
The company will lay only about two
miles of track at first, but later the
road will be extended to San Pablo
Park, and it is believed that the build
ing of this system is the initial step
toward an interurban railway between
Point Richmond and Oakland. The
road will be equipped with 35-foot
double end cars of the same pattern
as those now in use on the lines of
the Oakland Transit Consolidated and
the rolling stock and other equipment
will be thoroughly up-to-date.
The new corporation is capitalized at
$250,000. divided into 2500 shares, and
of this amount $2500 has already been
subscribed by the members of the
board of directors. They are: H. C.
Breedon, H. D. P'li'^ury, H. A. Byrnes,
D. G. Scoficld and W. S. Rheem.
The franchise for an electric road
secured some time ago by W. S. Rheem
has been turned over to the new cor
poration.

BISHOP TELLS
OF CLUB WORK
Presents Views oil the Forma
tion of Auxiliaries Among
Episcopal Laity in Oakland
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
. 1118 Broadway, Feb. 22.
The clergymen and representatives of
the laity from the Episcopal churches
of Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley met
at St. Paul's Church in this city this
evening to formulate plans for the or
ganization of an Alameda County
branch of the Diocesan Church Club,
the men's organization of the Episcopal
church of this diocese.
The objects of the church club and
the method of organizing branches of
the general body were explained by
Bishop William Ford Nichols. The
Bishop told of the good work done by
the Diocesan Church Club in extending
the field, of the church, and' advocated
the formation of a single branch of the
organization in Alameda County, which
should elect a president and other of
ficers, the president to act as a vice
president of and be under the jurisdic
tion of the president of the Diocesan
Club.
The Rev. C. T. Walkley, rector of St.
Paul's, expressed the belief that the
work of organization could be more
quickly accomplished if a club was or
ganized in each of the parishes of the
county, the federation of these clubs
to form the Alameda County branch of
the Diocesan Club. The Rev. Edgar F.
Geo, rector of St. John's Chvirch, agreed
with Dr. Walkley as to the manner of
organization, as did the Rev. O. St.
John Scott, rector of St. Andrew's
Church. The Rev. W. M. Guthrie, rec
tor of Christ Church, Alameda, and the
Rev. Clifton Macon, rector of Trinity
Church, opposed the plan of forming a
separate club in each parish, agreeing
with the suggestion of the Bishop that
a single Alameda County branch be
first organized. The laymen present at
the meeting were almost equally di
vided as to the most feasible of the
two plans suggested.
A committee was appointed- to confer
with a committee^ from the San Fran
cisco branch of the Diocesan Club. The
members of the committee are B. Hay
den, F. M. French and L. J. Leconte.
The meeting adjourned to the call of
the committee chairman.

BERKELEY, Feb. 22.â Woman's day
at the University of . California was
spoiled for the outdoor games that had

HOWARD'S FATE
URGES INQUIRY
Brother of the Late Captain
Seeks Information of Offi

WRITES THROUGH LAWYER
Letters Revive Interest in the
Death of Man. Whose Body
Was Found Near an Old Barn
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
. 7> 2143 Center Street. Feb. 23.
â¢ Interest in the. fate of the late
Thomas Howard, about which there
was so much speculation laat summer
when his body was found near a
barn in West Berkeley, was revived to
day when letters of inquiry were re
ceived by the Morgue and police offi
cials of Berkeley from the attorneys of
relatives in the East.
At the time of Captain Howard's
death it was supposed that his only
relatives were his wife and children
and E. "W. Turner, a nephew, all of
Victoria. Now it turns out that there
Is another relative in Chicagoâ a
brother, named Arthur Howard.
Through his attorney, F. B. Crossly,
secretary of the Northwestern Univer
sity Law School, this brother is seek
ing information of Captain Howard.
Crossly's letter to Town Marshal Kerns
follows: . i
"City Marshal, Berkeleyâ Dear Sir: I
am making: an effort to discover one
Captain John. Howard, who "was found
dead in your jurisdiction- on or about
Saturday, July 18, 1903, and who was a
brother of a client of mine. I bear to
request of "you any information you
may be ai>le to furnish as to Mr. How
ard's family or relatives or his home.
"F. B. CROSSLY."
In a letter to Deputy â  Coroner
Streightif, Attorney Crossly says that
he had asked for information of Tur
ner, Captain Howard's nephew, but haa
been refused. He proposed then, he
said, to appeal to the Victoria police tot
the information.
It is understood that the Eastern
relative does not intend to go into the
details as to Captain Howard's death,
as the Coroner's jury settled all contro
versy over that question when it
brought in a verdict of suicide.

When David Klnlry, thÂ© murderer of
Police Officer Jamei II. Smith, left
this city after the shooting of the
brave patrolman at Fourteenth and
Jackson streets. It Is believed that h*
struck across the Contra Costa hills
tn the direction of Walnut Creek.
stopping at the home of J. Alameda,
about midnight, to Inquire th* way to
that place.
Alameda owns a small tfairy and
vegetable garden on the Redwood
Canyon road near the Bridges ranch,
and he says that near midnight on the
night that Officer Smith was murdered
a man answering the description of
Klnlry stopped at his house and awoke
him to ask the way to Walnut Creek.
Alameda told the man that there was
no direct road to Walnut Creek from
his place, but said that he could di
rect him so that he could reach that
place. The mysterious visitor then
asked if he would strike the railroad
at Walnut Creek, and when told that
he would he said something about
wanting to keep away from railroads
and left.
The description that Alameda gives
of his midnight visitor tallies with
the description of the murderer, even
to the striped sweater Klniry wore on
the night of the shooting. The man
was carrying a small grip and was
evidently a stranger in that neighbor
hood. The lateness of the hour and
the fact that after dark there is very
little travel on the Redwood road
caused Alameda to remember the
visit of the mysterious unknown, but
as the dairyman is unable to read
English he knew nothing about the
shooting of Patrolman Smith until
the news was told him by one of his
countrymen from this city. The de
scription of the murderer as recited
by Alameda's friend exactly fitted the
mysterious caller at the Alameda res
idence on the night of the murder.
It is supposed that when Kiniry
went back to the Steadman residence
after the shooting he secured the grip
and then went through Piedmont and
Jack Hays Canyon to the Redwood
Canyon road and, becoming confused,
stopped to ask his way.

Triple Stake Event at Union
Park Interests Crowd and
Affords Some Exciting Sport
FULL MOON WINS EASILY
Angus Cissns Captures Belle
Brandon Cup and Pocatelli
Lands the Consolation Stake
Interest and enthusiasm ran high
amon? the large crowd at Union
Coursing Park yesterday afternoon
and the big triple eventâ Belle Bran
don Cup, California Plate and Consola
tion stakes-brought out some of the
fastest ones that have been seen in
action for many moons. The Belle
Brandon Cup event went to Angus
Cissus, Pocatelli captured the Conso
lation stake and Full Moon won the
California Plate from Tillie R by de
fault.
When the fourth round of the latter
stake had been run down, only four of
the best hounds remained, Tillie R,
FuU Moon, Mount Rose and Sea Lion.
Sacramento Boy went out in the first
course after a great run against Tillie
R, and Mount Rose easily lowered the
colors of the speedy Palo Alto by a
score of 11 to 4.
Mount Rose was withdrawn after
his run with Palo* Alto and Tillie R
got a bye in the first round. Full Moon
outpointed Sea I Aon handily and much
interest was centered in the course
between him and Tillie R. But Tillie
was worked hard all day anc\ the day
before also, so her owner, W. T.
Iiaught, was forced to withdraw her
and therefore forfeited the stake to
Full Moon.
Flower Girl was the favorite all the
way through for the honors in the
Belle Brandon stake. But Angus Cis
sus proved to be a dark horse and kept
t-orning strong all the time. He had
everything his own way up to the final
round and when he went up against
the favorite he led her all the way and
won 'he stake as he pleased.
The Consolation stake was a hotly
contested affair and nearly every
course was a wonder for excitement.
Pocatelli, the favorite, was there all
the time and won without much effort.
It looked from the first as though he
v.ruld be up against Ragtime or Lord
Brazen for the stake. Brazen beat
Ragtime in the semi-final run, but
whfn he went up against Pocatelli he
looked like a third rater and never
scored a point. Following are the re

IIAKLEAX GLADYS COLLAPSES.
Courser Falls on Field at Inglesldc
Under Suspicious Circumstances.
Frank Jones* celebrated courser Har
lean Gladys collapsed on the field at
Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday and
was carried in a dying condition to
the kennels. The opinion of nine out
of ten of the spectators present was
that the dog had been doped, and cir
cumstances certainly warranted the
suspicion. A full Investigation will be
made and it augurs not well for some
of the trainers, who are liberal In the
dispensing of sure thing "preps."
Outside attractions hurt the attend
ance at the park. The small crowd
present was well rewarded by some
good coursing. Toward the last there
was not as much as a look in, for the
prevailing fog obscured everything
from view. Â»
Reckless. Acrobat . won the- deciding
course from Harlean Gladys after an
undecided in a long course. Relief
dogs were sent out, but It took them

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1904.
BOMBARDIER, PILOTED BY WILLIE SEE,
CAPTURES THE RICH CALIFORNIA DERBY
Frank 'Skinner's Three-Year-Old Is a 10 to I Shot in the Betting.
Judge Beats the Even Money Favorite Formaster Out for the
Place, but Is Disqualified for a Foul and Placed Last 1 by Judges
SNAPSHOT PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE FAST RACEHORSE THAT WON THE RICH CALIFORNIA DERBY
STAKE AT THE OAKLAND TRACK YESTERDAY AFTERNOON," AND THE GAME LITTLE JOCKEY
WHO PILOTED HIM TO A WELL EARNED VICTORY.
Nearly 8000 people saw the seventh
California Derby run at Oakland track
yesterday. In fact, it was a much
larger gathering than that which
cheered Modicum when he came home
winner of the Burns Handicap at
Ineloside. Rain fell at intervals and
the track was very sloppy, though pos
sessing a hard bottom. The field which
contested for the rich prize, worth
$2725 to the first horse, was reduced to
four starters by the owners of Alendon
and Ananias resorting to the scratch
ing process. Then nine out of every
ten figured the race a, certainty for
Formaster, the entry of Boots & Hol
lenbeck, which ruled an even-money
favorite. Frank Skinner's Bombardier
furnished the surprise. Superbly rid
den by Willie See and S and 10 to 1 in
the betting, he made all the running
and passed the judges two and a half
lengths l.efore Judfre. One and a half
Jengths further back followed the fa
vorite, and next Toledo. Just after
passing the stand the first time Bull
man, on Formaster, while trying to
pass between Bombardier and Judge,
was cut off by Johnny Daly, astride the
latter, and again on the far turn Bull
man claimed Daly interfered with his
mount. Pullman lodged a complaint
of foul with the 3udges, which was al
lowed, and Mike Daly's black colt was
placed last. This action gave Formas
ter the place and moved Toledo into
third, hole.
Although an outsider, the winner
was well supported and his victory wa*
a decidedly popular one. Owned by
Frank Skinner, the well-known news
paper man, Bombardier, which has dis
played striking improvement of late, is
trained by Tobe Ramsey, the big Ok
lahoma turfman.
Despite the rain and slushy footing
some fine sport was witnessed. Mo
gregor and El Piloto were the only
winning favorites. The betting ring was
packed to suffocation with spectators.
Vanderbout, the apprentice recently
secured by Dell Fountain, left the
maiden jockey class in the introductory
sprint on Cousin Carrie. Because of
her rider being an unknown quantity
the mare's odds went from 6 to 25 to 1.
Away fourth she soon showed in the
lead and won all the way. Sir Tom
Tiddler, the even-money favorite, ran
second throughout, beating old Pat
Morrissey less than a length for the
place. Handpress and Flaneur per
formed indifferently.
Mogregor, the 13 to 10 favorite for
the two-year-old scramble, earned a
nose decision over Gloomy Gus. The
latter closed very strong and would
have scored in another stride or so.
Steel Wire, the second choice, finished
third. Norinne, the Napa Stock Farm
entry, showed early speed, but it was
her first trip to the barrier and she
tired perceptibly the last part of the
race.
Another favorite registered first In
the six and a half furlong selling num
ber. El Piloto, ridden by Buxton and
2 to 1 in the* ring, passed Ocyrohe in
the stretch and at the wire disposed
of Meehanus in clever fashion., I Know
lost the show to Ocyrohe by nearly a
length.
Stuart made no mistakes with Caro
nal this particular trip in the mile and
fifty-yard selling affair. The St. Carlo
horse was quoted at 5 to 1 and simply
spreadeagled his company. At the
wire Rey Dare, the runner up, was
seven lengths away, with Cloche; d'Or
third, six lengths farther back. Then
followed G. W. Trahern, the 7 to 5
favorite.

YOUNG CORBETT
HARD AT WORK
Champion Training Faithfnlly
at the Beach for His Fight at
the Pavilion on Monday Sight
IS CONFIDENT OF VICTORY
Dave Sullivan Is Fast Round
ing Into Form and Expects
to Put Up a Good Battle
Young Corbett Is not losing any time
in getting intd condition for his fight
with Dave Sullivan next Monday night.
The champion has been working out
regularly at the Beach Tavern for sev
eral days past and at the present time
is in splendid form.
His present weight is 133 pounds. He
is to do 130 pounds ringside for Sul
livan and states that he will be down
to the required weight in a few days.
His wind is good and altogether the
little fellow looks to be in the best of
form and ready to fight the battle of
his life. .
The wet weather is not at all agree
able to Corbett and he has been chafing
under restraint for the last few days.
He has been compelled to confine him
self almost entirely to Indoor work and
as the champion is such a strong ex
ponent of road work and outside exer
cise in general the rain* does not suit
him exactly.
Yesterday a large crowd of well
known sporting men journeyed to the
beach tavern notwithstanding the rain.
They watched Corbett go through his
gymnasium stunts. He chatted pleas
antly to his friends as he worked and
seemed anxious about the outside
world, for he has not been along the
line much of late
He has had to cut out those pilgrim
ages to the track, though this has in
no way dampened his ardor. He is
still interested in the game and between
exercises plies his trainers with ques
tions regarding the ponies and the
jockeys. He is betting right along and
picking 'em right.
Sullivan is also rounding into form
across the bay and expresses himself
as fully satisfied with his training
quarters and the climate. He states
that he will make the required weight
and be able to fight strong. He is not
worrying about the outcome of the mill
and expresses himself as being con
fident of his ability to beat the cham
pion.

FUSILADE WINS
IN A GALLOP
F..T. CnrolaiTs Great Pony Takes
Two Events in Hollow Style
on the Del Monte Track
SILVER DICK IS A WONDER
Takes the Quarter-Mile Dash
From a High-Class Field.
End of a Successful Meeting
DEL. MONTE, Feb. 22.â Sliver Dick
and Fusilade, the fastest two ponies in
all America at their respective dis
tances, were the star performers to
day at the meet of the California Polo
and Pony Racing Association.
Silver Dick had Lawrence McCreery
in the saddle, as on Saturday, and he
received a perfect ride in the quarter
mile dash, his only start. As usual he
was first away from the post and he
won by a length in a swinging sallop,
running: the quarter on a slow track in
:24Â»4. F. J. Cardan's Bonnie was sec
ond. Becky, which finished third, was
away badly and never made up tha
lost gTound. Paul Clagstone's mare
Miss Miller cut up badly at the post,
throwing her rider. Walter McCreery.
He escaped unhurt, but thought It
safest to remain on the ground.
F. J. Carolan's great pony Fusilade
started In two races. He proved in a
class by himself, winning in hollow
style. He won the mile in a common
canter, being pulled nearly double for
the greater part of the journey. R.
and W. McCreery's Miss Giles flnishe-i
second, the others being beaten off.
Mr. Carolan sported his blue and
white colors again on Fusilade in the
five-eighths of a mile run. In this the
southern contingent thought they had
a good chance to beat the chestnut
horse from Burllngame with Carlotta.
a bay mare. Whatever chance they
had was ruim-d.at the start when F.
W. W r ilson, who rode the mare, lost
his stirrup. With this handicap he
finished second
The closest race of the day was the
second on the card, at three-eighths <>f
a mile. There were only two starters
and it was won by F. J. Carolan's
Florodora. ridden by Ti. MeCreery. She
finished a short head in front of Ru
dolph Snreckels' Fretful, ridden by K.
M. Tobin. The latter made his move
an instant too late, as in another stritl"
after they passed the wire his mount
was in the lead
The third race, at a quarter of a
mile, provided another sensational fin
ish. R. and W. McCreery's Sunset, rid
den by Walter McCreery, beat the
gray mare Sadie, from Southern Cali-
fornia, in a stirring finish.
Rudolph Spreckels' colors were car
ried to victory in the fifth race by
Maud H, the smallest pony at the track,
standing only fifty- five inches high.
Her size gave her a decided pull in the
weights. Bonnie finished second and
pulled up lame.
There was a touch of the wild West
in the rescue race by troopers of the
Ninth United States Cavalry. Some of
the men threw their horses to the
ground, while others started on a gal
lop toward them from a mark 150 yards
away. They galloped down the polo
field, and each rider picked up one of
the men on tha ground and galloped
back to the starting point. Sergeant
Tucker and Private Ogilsby of Troop
A finished first amid the cheers of the
spectators.
Thanks to the efficiency of the racing
secretary, Robert L.eighton, and to the
other officials, the affair went off with
out the slightest delay or hitch. The
attendance was large each day.
After the races a practice match of
polo was started. Play had been in
progress but a short time when E.
Ezra, the noted English noloist, was
thrown and sustained a severe injury
to the knee. It is expected he will he
laid up for some time.

NEVILL'S MINES
ARE TIED UP
I'nderjiTMnid Men Demand an
Increase in Hate of Wages and
Refusal Has Caused a Strike
PlXK-Lal Disratch to The Cail.
STOCKTON. F<?b. 21.â The strike of
n-.iners at the Rawhide and App mines,
â¢ .*ned by \V. A. Xevilis, has practi
cally tied up business at Jamestown, j
a iid i? very likely to result in blood- i
V-hed. *The strike at the App has been !
on for several months, but it was only '
:^5t Wednesday that the miners walked
'out at the Rawhide. Nearly all the
strikers are Auftrians and only a few
of them understand English.
The strikers are armed and they have
j",Â«ted pickets to prevent Captain Nev
ills sending men to the mine to take
their places. Last Friday Nevills took
right men through Stockton to work
ifa the Rawhide. The strikers* pickets
â¢^et the non-union men at Jamestown
and turned them back- j
The strikers are said to be unreason
able and in a dangerous temper. Cap
taJn-JfeVUIs is a fighter and is deter
mined "to run his mine with non-union
help. The Rawhide mine is within the
iur'.edic^Jon of the Jamestown union,
under whose auspices the strike is be
i'r.s conducted. It was declared for
the purpose of securing an increase of
2j cents per day for each class of work
ers.
It is said Ahat cme of the reasons for
the strike at the Rawhide was that
the management insisted that the min
ers board at the company's boardins
jjouse. It is also said that Assistant
â¢Manager Burk discharged a miner, giv-
Jnsr as a reason that the man ate too
c much butter.
Captain N'evills has had difficulty
â¢ ;n the miners' union for a long time.
Some time ago he imported Austrians
to do practically all of the underground
work In his mines. The Austrians did
uÂ«t learn the American language, but
jhey did learn American manners to
â¢ tbe extent that they became union men
to an almost fanatical degree.

of Chicago Bodies of Two
3Ien and a Woman Are Found
CHICAGO, Feb. 22.â Fire to-day
partially destroyed the building: oc
cupied by the Alhambra Theater,
hotel and apartments. The structure
was three stories high and fronted on
Archer avenue and State and Nine
teenth streets. After the fire was ex
tinguished three bodies were found
in a room on the ' top floor 'of the
Tmilding. From -the position of the
remains the two men had apparently
attempted to assist the woman to es
cape, but had been overcome by
smoke. All clothing was burned from
the bodies and the flesh seared and
scorched. The remains of the men
were identified as "William Fisher and
Frank Beckman, both of whom had
recently arrived here from Cincinnati.
The body of the woman was identified
as that of Anna Smith.
There were many narrow escapes
and several persons had to be car
ried down the fire escapes.
The Alhambra Theater, around
which the hotel is built, was partly
destroyed. In the theater new stage
fittings and furnishings had been in
stalled, and remodeling in compliance
with the new theater ordinance had
practically been completed. The fire
is supposed to have started trom an
overheated boiler in the basement of
the Alhambra restaurant- The smoke
soon filled the halls of the upper sto
ries, and but for the night clerk, Phil
lip Vingo, the firemen asserted, there
would probably have been much
greater loss of life. Vingo ran
through the halls, awakening the 200
guests. A moment later the halls were
filled with half-naked men and
women, who groped their way down
the stairs to the snow-covered streets
and sought refuge in neighboring
stores. The Alhambra Theater is
owned by Stair & Haviland. owners
of the Bijou, Columbus and other the
aters in Chicago.' The loss is estimated
at $75,000.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 22.â Tempted
by the promise that George E. Cham
berlain, the Governor of Oregon, should
be chosen chairman of a union of the
Democratic delegations of the Pacific
Coast States, the Democrats of Oregon
agreed to-day by resolution of the State
Central 'Committee to act in concert
with California and such other States
as might enter the merger. All sugar
coated from California came , the
scheme. Two ministers plenipotentiary
from California were presentâ B.
D. Murphy, chairman of the State Cen
tral Committee of California, and L.
H.. Mooser. its treasurer. They told the
Oregon braves that a union of the
Western States was the only way they
could compel recognition at the national
convention: that California would send
an uninstructed delegation; that .it
would not insist on foisting Hearst
upon the other States; that the present

HIGBEE TO GO
TO THE EAST
Manager of American and Red
Star Line of Steamers Has
Eeen Called to Xew York
NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â G. H. Higbee,
for some years the Pacific Coast man
ager of the American and Red Star
line of steamers, has been called to New
York to become manager at this port.
The American line will also bring to
this port its Pacific Coast steamships.
They are the Indiana, Pennsylvania,
Ohio and Conemaugh. The Indiana has
arrived here with the largest cargo of.
salmon ever brought from the Pacific
Coast, having 7000 tons on board. The
Pennsylvania and Conemaugh are on
their way now. The Ohio is being over
, hauled at Seattle and will be brought
East later. The Indiana and Ohio have
been in use as Government transports
doing service to the Philippines.
Higbee will occupy a position subor
dinate to that of Clement A. Griscom
Jr., who will retain his position as di
rector of the liqes. Higbee's special
work will be the insurance of the line,
in which branch he has had long expe
rience.
The vessels of the Pacific Coast fleet
will enter the North Atlantic service,
but the American line declines to make
public Its intentions at the present time.
One theory was that the vessels would
be put into the projected Scandinavian
service. Whether or not the Pacific
fleet will enter this proposed service
from the north, they are here for some
important purpose not yet explained,
and definite announcements will be
awaited with interest.
The sixty-six days' trip of the Indi
ana from Seattle was rather an un
eventful voyage, with but two stops for

at St. Lucia.
movement was not a Hearst scheme.
"We have nothing up t our sleeve,"
said the gentlemen, and to prove it
they proposed that the chairman of
the delegation be Governor Chamber
lain. The opponents of the measure
besought the committee to beware of
Greeks bearing gifts. They said openly
that California, the biggest State,
would dominate the merger and that
the movement was only a scheme to
vote the Western States solidly for Hie
man of many newspapers. They did
not want Hearst, and said so heatedly,
but the majority voted them down.
"Hearst is sure not to get it any
way," said the majority. "The killing
of his boom in the convention will open
a road for us to name Chamberlain for
Vice â¢ President. The vote of Oregon
could not kill off Hearst. If it did
Hearst would kill off CHamberlain
Therefore it behooves us to stand in."
The California politicians leave to
morrow for Seattle.
Society Buds in Wichita.
Recently a Wichita miss of 10 en
tertained eight friends at an evening
party and there were nine cream puffs
on a dessert platter. Each girl took
one except the hostess, which passed
without attracting notice. They were
delicious and the hostess urged tfie
ninth one upon each of her guests in
turn, but not one would take it. This
was before the gas company had en
larged its main, by the way. Suddenly
the gas flickered and went almost out,
so that the room was quite dark, and
eight dimpled hands met in that
cream puff platter. â Wichita (Ivans.)

HOAR SAYS HE
WAS MISQUOTED
Senator From Massachusetts
Declares He Had No Desire
to Reflect on the President
COLLOQUY WITH FOKAKER
Ohio Man Is Charged With
Misrepresentation and Quite
a Heated Debate Follows
WASHINGTON. Feb. 22. â The fea
ture of *o-<Jay's session of the, Senate
was a speech from Hoar in explana
tion of his former speech on the isth
mian canal situation. He complained
of the criticisms of his utterances at
that time, saying that he hud been
misunderstood and misrepresented
and contended that his intention on
that occasion had been, to secure full
information on the Panama â¢ revolt
and not to cast reflections on the Pres
ident. , â  :. \ ..-' Y ' '. ' "
Foraker was mentioned among oth
ers--who had criticized the first ipeech,
and after Hoar had concluded the
Ohio Senator replied that he had not
meant unjustly to reflect on Hoar and
justifying his , remarks, by quoting
from Hoar's original 'speech. , Hoar
replied, a causing Foraker j not . only .of
having misrepresented him on the flrat
occasion, -but of misrepresenting him
to-day. The result was/a sharp col
loquy at short range and when It-came
to a conclusion the Senators did not
appear to have approached any near
er to an understanding than at the be
ginning.
The two Senators Â»tood within two
or three feet of. each other and talked
back a.nd forth directly. They gestic
ulated earnestly and spoke with great
emphasis, frequently punctuating
their remarks with expressions of mu
tual regard. Each asserted more than
once that the other was mistaken and
as frequently the statement was made
that each had been misunderstood.
The situation was .quite tense and en
dured for several minutes until the
presiding officer called attention to
the violation of the rules of debate.
The immediate point of dispute was
the question .whether at the. time of
Hoar's former speech denial had been
made of the President's complicity in
the Panama affair. Hoar contending
that no such denial had been made.
Hoar quoted the President's denial
of complicity on the part of the Unit
ed States and asked;
"Is there any man, friend or foe,
who will doubt that statement? Will
the campaign orators from } Portland
to San Francisco .have among them
one who will accuse that brave and
honest man with dishonesty When he
gave utterance to that statement?"
WASHINGTON'S
NAME HONORED
In East and West, the North
aiid the South, Anniversary
of His Birth Is Celebrated
-CHICAGO, Feb. 22.â The anniversary
of the birth of Washington was ob- 1
served here to-day by the Union j
League Club with two meetings at the j
Auditorium Theater, one in the morn-
Ing and the other in the afternoon, and
a banquet to-night to the members of
the club. The principal service was
held in the afternoon when Elihu Root,
former Secretary of War, delivered an
address on "The Ethics of the Panama
Question." He said in part:
The independence of Panama, the grant to
the 'United States of the right to construct
the canal across the Isthmus and the as-<
Eumption by the United States of the duty
to construct the canal and to maintain It
for the equal benefit of mankind, are ac
complished facts. * Nothing can do away with
them unless it be some future war of con
quest waged against the liberties of Pan
ama, and at the same time against the rights
of the United States held in trust for the
commerce of . the world.
By all the principles of Justice among men
and among nations that we have learwed from
our fathers and all peoples and all govern
ment?, should maintain the revolutionists In
Panama were right, the people of Panama
were entitled to be free again, the Isthmus
was theirs and they were entitled to govern
it; and it would have been a shameful thing
for the Government of the United States to
return them again to servitude.
We shall not get back the money we spend
upon the canal any more than we shall get
back the money we, have expended to make
Cuba free and Independent, or the money we
have expended to set the people of the Phil
ippines on the path of ordered liberty and
competency for self-government. But we
shall promote our commerce, we shall unite
our Atlantic and Pacific coasts, we shall ren
der Inestimable service ' to mankind, and -we
shall grow In greatness and honor and In
1 the strength that comes from difficult tasks
accomplished and from the exercise of the
power that strives in the nature of a great!
constructive people.'

WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â Senator
Bard introduced in the Senate to-day
and. Mr. McLachlan in the House a
bill calculated to secure for Los An
geles the site for its Federal building,
which the conferees of the urgent de
ficiency bill refused to provide. The
bills are identical and authorize the
Secretary of the Treasury to enlarge
the ' present site as desired by pur
chase or condemnation, provided the
property can be had for not more than
$225,0001 In case of failure in ttiis
then he may secure by the same means

may. be suitable, the price not to ex
ceed $200,000, or he may sell the prop
erty owned by the Government and
purchase another site at a cost not to
exceed, in addition to the proceeds of
the .sale^. the . sum named. This bill
does notincrease the total appropria
tion of $850,000 for the site and build
ing, but the Increased allowance for
the site leaves a shortage of $19,600,
which the House refused to make
good, to ,be cut from the appropriation
for the "building. "A new bill next ses
sion, it Is expected, will provide the

Senator Perkins to-day Introduced a
bill to provide for the appointment of
an additional District Judge for the
Northern District of California. The
bill . provides that the senior Circuit
Judge of the Ninth Circuit, or the resi
dent Circuit Judge within the district
shall make the necessary order for
the division of business or assignment
of cases for the northern judicial dis
trict.
This bill is Identical with that intro
duced In the House by Metcalf. Letters
have been received by Senator Perkins
from Judges Ross, Gilbert and Mor
row, who join In paying that this bill
meets every, requirement for the relief
of Federal courts and that the creation
of an additional judicial district is not
necessary. .,..*.
The Judiciary Committee of the
House has ordered a . favorable report
upon Jones' bill for the creation of a
second judicial district in the State of
Washington, which provides for divis
ion of State by Cascade Mountain
range.
The three Representatives of Wash
ington have. each fathered a different
division of the State. Cushman would
have divided it with a line running
east and west between Tacoma and Se
attle, which would have left the seat of
the court in each of these principal
cities of the State. Humphrey would
have cut a square out of the northwest
corner of the State to include Seattle,
which would have left Tacoma and
Spokane to fight for the location of
the court. Jones' bill, which divides
the State by a north and south line,
leaves the court of the first district to
remain, as now, in Seattle, while that
of the second will naturally go to Spo
kane, the metropolis east of the moun
tains.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Feb. 22.â The
Citizens' Industrial Association of
America, in session in this city, by
unanimous vote to-day adopted the
following resolution:
nesolvcd. That the propajtanda of labor
unionism in the United States and the every

ary and subversive of the rights of labor and
the employers of labor and of the laws of the
land; above all they are destructive of the
rights and liberties of the great body of the
people. Irrespective of their affiliation with
unionism or with employers of labor.
Resolved further. That the present condition
of anarchy and contempt for law and the con
stituted authorities brought about by the law
less leaders and members of labor unions has
forced upon the peace-loving: citizens of the
United States the necessity of demanding that
the names and whereabouts of these law
breakers, who practice intimidation boycot
ting, picketing, destruction of property and
who commit assaults upon their fellow-iabor
ers or commit other crimes in â¢ the name of
labor, be made known for the protection of all
law-abidinr people and for the best interest of
labor itself and to the end that justice may
be meted out. â¢

mittee Is hereby directed to take the necessary
steps to ascertain the identity of such persons
and obtain full information in connection
therewith and that a report of the same bÂ«

The following resolution was passed
unanimously: i
That the use of the union label on manu
factured articles recognizes and indorses the
endeavor of the labor organization to control
the labor market and is no Indication of tha
quality of the goods, and its use is a surrender
of individual freedom and is a badge of sub
serviency; be it
Resolved. That the Citizens' Industrial As

the use of such labels and urges on manufac

AGED CHINESE
IS FOUND DEAD
Grass Valley Coroner Thinks
the Celestial the Victim of
War Between Rival Tongs
GRASS VALLEY, Feb. 22. â What
appears to have been a cold-blooded
murder was committed here last
night. The body of an old Chinese
named Yung was found in a shack in
Chinatown this morning with his head
hacked and gashed as though with a
hatchet. â  Coroner Hocking and th<Â»
officers who investigated the affair
found that all the blood had be"n
carefully wiped up from the floor aivi
that the weapon with which the crime
had evidently been committed was
missing 1 . A Chinese was found who
said that Yung had committed sui
cide, but the officers, who believe he
knows all about the cFime, refused to
place credence in his tale.
He was closely pressed and at last
led the officers to a rubbish pile in
which was found a hatchet. There
were no bloodstains on the weapon.
Coroner Hocking removed the body of
the Chinese to the morgue. It Is ex
pected that arresta will follow before
night, as it is believed Yung is a vic
tim of a rival tong. The presence of
some strange Chinese, who ''have been
celebrating the new year, lends color
to the theory.
provement in manufacture and national ad
vancement can be secured.
Separate resolutions denouncing the

resolutions will be sent to the Congres

ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL
MATCHES ARE DEFERRED
Sodden Condition of Grounds Prevents
the Contest Between Thistles and
Hornets of Oakland.
The match for the championship of
the California Association Football
League, set for yesterday on the Pre
sidio athletic grounds between the
Oakland Hornets and the Thistles, did
not take place. The playing field was
nearly covered with water. Shand a'nd
Pomeroy of the Oakland Hornets, and
several of the Thistle eleven reached
the grounds shortly after 2 o'clock
and found a notice, signed by King,
secretan't and Forrest, captain of the
Thistles, and by Chambers, captain,
and Pomeroy, secretary of the Oak
land Hornets, postponing the- match,
posted on the gate.
Airth, goalkeeper of the Vampire
eleven, while defending the goal in
the match between the Thistles and
the Vampires on Sunday, was knocked
down by Lydon, center forward of the
Thistles, and a few moments elapsed
before it was discovered that Alrth's
collarbone had been fractured. It is
curious that the accident should have
happened in the last few minutes of
the last match to be played by the
Vampires during the season* for the
championship of the league. It will
be necessary for the Vampires to find
a new goalkeeper for the matches for
the cup.

LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
Well-to-Do Citizen of Watson
ville Falls a Victim to
Cupid's Wiles in Stockton
Special Dispatch to The Call,
STOCKTON, Feb. 22.â The distinction
of having the first real leap year wed
ding this season can be claimed by
Stockton. It was a case of May, win
some and pretty, "popping" to Decem
ber, wealthy and jolly, a ready accept
ance and a happy ceremony on Wash
ington's birthday. County Clerk
Graham probably never before issued
a marriage license having behind it a
story so interesting as when he granted
Vernum Westcott, aged 60 years, of
Watsonville, the legal permit to wed
Miss Lizzie Shaver, aged 21, of Stock
ton this morning. To-day being a legal
holiday, the County Clerk's office was
closed. But that did not deter the aged
man, who was soon to become a groom.
Westcott called at the police office this
morning and asked where the County
Clerk might be found. The latter was
soon summoned and, as Graham was
making out the license, the happy old
man confided the story of how he was
wooed and won by a girl just past her
'teens.
Westcott stated that a short time ago
he came to Stockton from Watsonville
on a visit. Here he met Miss Shaver,
and cupid cut a strange caper. The old
man and the young lady grew very
friendly at once, though from his
standpoint it was more like the friend
ship of a father for a daughter. Then
came the leap-year proposal. As they
sat together, so Westcott told the
County Clerk, the young lady exclaimed
"You're an awfully nice old man; I just
like you. Why don't you get married?"
"W T hy, no one would have an old man
like me; it's too late. You wouldn't
marry me yourself," returned the gray
headed man.
The girl declared that she would, and
that, explained how a sixty-year-old
man happened to be securing a license
to wed a twenty-one-year-old maiden.
It is said that Westcott is quite
wealthy, but he denies that his gold,
as well as his good nature and gray
hairs, entered into the love affair. The
young bride-is a sister of a local clair
voyant and is well known here.

Boat Racing at Vallejo.
VAL.L.EJO, Feb. 22.â The exhibition
of submarine boats in San Pablo Bay
was postponed on account of bad
weather. The rowing regatta, how
ever, came off under, the auspices of
the Vallejo Yachting and Rowing Club.
There were four races on the card.
The first was between gigs from the
United States steamship Tacoma, the
Yacht Club crew and the Ragged
Edges. The Yacht, Club crew won,
Ragged Edges second, Tacoma third.
The second race was of ten oars be
tween crews from the Tacoma and the
Independence and was won by the lat
ter crew. The third race was between
apprentices from the Tacoma and the
Independence, in which the Tacoma
was again victorious. The last race
was between two four-oared shells,
both crews being from the Yacht Club.
The winning crew was composed of
Wood Watson, Frank Savage, Bert
Dunning and F. Morest. The other
crew met with an accident and was
practically out of the race. The course
was from Magazine to a point off the
Yacht Club house, a distance of about
a mile and a quarter.
Golf Contests Arc Postponed.
The qualifying round over eighteen
holes, medal play, with handicap, set
down to take place yesterday on the
course of the San Francisco Golf Club,
was postponed on acount of the In- 1
clemency of the weather. As next
Saturday ls open on the schedule of
events, the round will probably be
held on that day. The handicap for
ladies and a similar competition for
men arranged to take place yesterday
on the San Rafael links were also
postponed.
Rain Prevents Sports.
The champion tennis tournament
which was scheduled to be played "on
the East Oakland courts yesterday was
postponed on account of the rain. The
meeting of the Scottish bowlers on the
Golden Gate Park green and that of

FIRE FOLLOWS
OIL EXPLOSION
Railroad Depot and an Engine
and a Composite Coach Are
Destroyed Near Tehacliapi
FLAMES RAPIDLY SPREAD
Powder in Station-House Ex
plodes and With Great Deal
of Difficulty 'â  Town Is Saved
BAKERSFIELD, Feb. 22.â At 12:30
to-day the engine attached to the west
bound Santa Fe limited took fire while
stopping at the Tehacliapi station on
the joint track of the Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe railroads. The engine
was an oil burner and the oil caught
fire between the tank and engine. An
explosion followed, wrecking the loco
motive and setting fire to a composite
coach immediately behind. Both were
destroyed. From these the flames
spread to the depot, a frame structure,
which burned rapidly to the ground.
There was a large amount of powder
in the station building and when this
exploded It made an enormous confla
gration, which it was feared would
spread to the town and completely de
stroy it, as it has no fire protection
and ls composed mostly of frame struc
tures. The flre, however, did not get
beyond the railroad property.
The telegraph poles and wires run
ning through the town were burned
down, destroying all communication
to the south. The remainder of the
train escaped injury, and the wreck
ing crew was sent from Bakersfleld
with another engine, which is expected
to bring the train in about 5 o'clock.
None of the passengers or train crew
was injured.
The loss, including engine, car and
station, is estimated by the railroad
officials at about $50,000. A temporary
station will be opened in a boxcar until
it is possible to rebuild.
BURIED BENEATH
SHIFTING SANDS
Efforts to Sink a Well at the
Ocean Beach Almost Termi
nate'ln a~SEbcking Tragedy
A strange incident that nearly ter
minated in a tragedy happened on the
bleak sand dunes south of the Cliff
House during Sunday's storm. Manuel
Nicholas, a Greek, was digging a well
and the sides caved in on him. The
hole way some ten feet deep and the
shifting sands made it a difficult task
for the rescuers, who, however, fought
death inch "by Inch and finally pre
sented the Greek to* his sobbing wife
In a condition that might be described
as "slightly disfigured, .but still in the
ring."
The rescuers were a band of merry
makersâartists and writersâ who now
laughingly tell how they "jollied" Man
uel and kept his wife ( at bay, for at
times she came dangerously near the
edge and another "cave in" was mo
mentarily expected. It Happened in
this way:
Xavier Martinez, the well known art
ist, has taken up his abode in the re
motest car of Carville, with \he inten
tion of doing some sketching far from
the madding crowd. But, despite his
isolated situation, Martinez finds that
strenuous times follow him. Sunday
he Invited a number of his friends to
dine with him, promising them a Mexi
can dinner cooked by himself. A Slav
named George W. Weldon came over
the sand dunes to the hungry artists
and asked them to help him dig a well.
"We came not here to dig wells," an
swered Martinez. "We are here to rest
and eat and listen to the story of, the
sea." Whereupon ;the Slav hailed Man
uel Nicholas, who, with his wife, was
returning from an outing. The good
natured Manuel fell an easy victim to
the wiles of the Slav, and, armed with
pick and shovel, these two foreigners
set to work to dig a well in the un
certain sands.
The little crowd in the car dismissed
the matter from their minds until they
were about to sit down to dinner, when
Weldon rushed in with the news that
his newly acquired assistant was
buriedin the well. By this time it was
pouring. The men of the crowd rushed
hatless acros the sand. They found the
man buried to his neck and the sand
still trickling in. His arms were pin
ioned, and one of the men in his ex
citement jumped in, carrying an ava
lanche with him, that completely cov
ered the unfortunte man.
Meanwhile the sand was pressing on
the buried man's chest in such a Avay
that he could not breathe, and he
lapsed into unconsciousness. Clarence
Wilson, an able-bodied man, shoveled
unceasingly. Herman Scheffauer, the
poet, stood on a rudely constructed
scaffolding hauling up buckets of sand.
He was dressed in a cutaway, with a
carnation in his buttonhole and a book
of Stirling's poems sticking out of his
pocket. Charles Unger acted as nurse,
running for smelling salts, which he
and Malcolm Fraser in turns presented
to Manuel when his head was once
again in view.- Martinez also stood on
the scaffolding and held the ends of the
rope that was around Nicholas' body,
and when finally the weight of sand
was removed from his trunk the entire
company took hands at the rope" and
pulled. It was a "tug of war" in real
earnest, and the best of every man's
muscle was on' that rope. When Man
ueliemerged from his temporary grave
a shout went up.
The ladles of ' the party had mean
while taken the hysterical Mrs. Nicho
las to the car. It was hard to tell
which .was in the worse condition,
Manuel or his wife.
Now Mrs. Nicholas declares that
Manuel-. will never dig a; well again.

STRIKES A SUBMERGED OBSTRUCTION
AND DAMAGES STARBOARD PROPELLER
Steamship Sierra Hits Wandering Log -or Water-Covered Derelict.
Although One Screw Is Partly Crippled the Liner Makes Port
Within Limits of Schedule and Lands . British Mail on Time
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Sierra. Captain H. C. Houdlette,
which arrived yesterday fro-m the An
tipodes and Honolulu, came into port
I with her starboard propeller partly out
j of commission, the . result of an en
counter about 10:20 o'clock Sunday
nipht with some submerged obstruc
tion. With the port screw, however,
the liner made good headway a*nd
! reached port well within the limits of
j her schedule. The obstruction struck
t is thought to have been a submerged
I log or may have been some water cc-v-
I ered derelict that has retained of buoy
' ancy just enough to keep it sufficiently
I near the surface to catch the keels of
| vessels whose course may 'cross the
i wreck's submarine wanderings. The
j liner was churning along at full speed
j when she struck ar.d the impact jarrel
; the big steamship from end to end. It
is thought that one or two blades were
â¢tripped off the starboard i propeller.
The Siena will be drydocked and it is
possible that the marks on her hull
may reveal the nature of the hidden
menace over which she bumped.
The Sierra brought 200 passengers
and a general cargo which included
! shipments of iron bark. wool, tin, ilKnp,
| C0O0 bags of sugar and 1416 bunenes of
. bananas.
Among the passengers were two the
| atrical stars that have been playing in
1 the coionies and are bound for Eng
j land. Miss Maud Miltc-n and \V. H.
Denny are the names of these stage
folk and both are said to have been
popular In Australia. "I am something
of a celebrity in London," said Denny,
, "but Misw Milton is better known In
j provincial England than at the capital.
'â  'Dick' Mansfield and I are great friends,
; and Dave ISelasco asked me to let him
; know when I arrived."
Rodolph Tudor, manager of the Gros
| venor Hotel, Sydr.ej', and one if the
best known bonifaces in the southern
hemisphere, was a passengjr on the
Sierra. George Compere, the v:ell
known cntorr.e-Icgist, returned the
j liner.

PURE FOOD EXPOSITION
ARRANGED BY GROCERS
Will Ue HolÂ«l to Promote the Inter
ests of Producer, Manufacturer,
Dealer and Consumer.
The San Francisco retail grocers
have Rrranged to give a Pure Food
Industrial Exposition at Mechanics'
Pavilion, commencing April 30 and
extending to May 15. It is the pur
pose to promote the mutual interests
of the producer, the manufacturer, the
retail grocer and the consumer.
This being the first exposition 'under
the auspices* of the association, every
member is doing his utmost to make
it a success. Business Manager Clark
reports fifty-seven applications for
_space, which augurs well for the ex
position when it is considered that the
preliminary announcement was made
only a few days ago.
The committee offers a prize of $10
for the best design and $5 for the next
best design for a three-sheet poster to
be worded, "San Francisco ' Retail
Grocers* Pure Food and Industrial Ex-
position. April 36 to May 15, 1904."
As the subject of pure food Is one of
vital import, the forthcoming exposi
tion will present an i Invaluable object
lesson to every householder.
Thieves nt the Presidio.
O. C. . Davis of the Twenty-ninth
Coast Artillery stationed at the Pre
pidib. reported to the police yesterday
that a guitar,, eight razors, a leather
razor case* and a hone had been stolen
from his quarters on Sunday. Some
of the articles Were marked.
Earthquake .Visits 'City.
San Francisco was visited with a
slight earthquake shock a few minutes
alter three o'clock yesterday , morn
liig. The direction of the waves. was
from north to south. The shock lasted
only about six seconds.
TIME IS KIND
TO THOMPSON
Veteran Impersonator of Joshua
Whitcomb Is as Delightful
as Ever in "01(1 Homestead*'
APPEAKS AT THE COLUMBIA
The A r ersatile Alcazar Company
Drops Back Into Comedy and
Gives a Broadhurst Play
That Denman Thompson is. a little
older and the double quartet a very
good one is all of new that can be said
of . "The Old Homestead, " this week
and next at the Columbia Theater. One
of the oldest of the truly rural plays,
most of Its best stuff has been made
yet more familiar by the bucolic pla
giarist. Practically the only thing that
has not been plagiarized is Denman
Thompson himself, and the contingency
continues unlikely. With the shrewd,
quaint humor of Mr. Thompson behind
it, "The Old Homestead" is still strong
to amuse, as last night's good house
handsomely testified. What it would
be without the actor is interesting if
unprofitable surmise.
It. is a rarely easy and unobtrusive
art that Thompson brings to his pic
ture of the oldSwanzey farmer. Un
like a good many younger realists, Mr*
Thompson seems to consider it unnec
essary to chew his words into unrecog
nizable rags. He can be heard at will,
even to his softest and quaint inflec
tions, and his quiet, illuminative ges
ture is just as good money's worth. In
fact, Mr. Thompson's Joshua Whitcomb
remains one of the best portraits of
Its class, human', convincing and wholly
lovable.
The actor is well supported. Fred
Clare,' who booms a noble bass in the
double quartet, is clever as Happy Jack,
and the rest fill in acceptably in their
not too arduous roles. The quartet is
more than usually good, built upon a
couple of bassos with a sensational cel
lar note between them and an uncom
monly handsc-me diapason above.
There is a tenor, too (second), who
trills an agreeable and sympathetic
song, and a useful barytone. A woolly
arrangement of the "Flower Song" and
"Soldiers' Charms" from "Faust," well
sung, was among the new numbers,
but it is just as well, under the cir
cumstances to stick to the "Old Oaken
Bucket."
BLANCHE PARTINGTOX.
Alcazar.
The Alcazar company again displayed
its versatility last night by dropping
back into the rollicking Broadhurst
farce "The Wrong Mr. Wright." Bar
ring the fact that there was only one
member of the aggregation who did not
make a Blip in his lines, the fine .old
laugh-producer went off with a snap
and a vim.
'â¢ When he gets into farce comedy Mr.
Durkln has the trick of making people
wonder whether he shouldn't remain
there. The bluster and bluff of the gay
Mr. Seymour Sites seem to sit more
easily upon the leading man's shoulders
than some of the heavier parts which
have fallen to his lot. He has an aban
don of manner and a trite breeziness
which would seem to be all Willie Col
lier's ownâ with a little more effort.
Grand OÂ»>era-House.
'All the good old Irish plays you ever
saw contributed to the composition of
"The Gamekeeper." a piece of fierce
melodrama, produced by Thomas J.
Smith and an incompetent company at
the Grand Opera-house last evening.
The play, trite as it was, was far. too
good for most of the acting. Smith
himself was not a bad Derry fieolan,
the gamekeeper, with the alternate
role of Dennis Brady, and his songs,
though sung with a thin voice, pleased
the small audience. His acting is nat
ural and shows humor. In short, he
might fill third parts with some suc
cess. Ed Van Murrel's comedy in
Johnnie Drake, the country bumpkin,
was occasionally amusing, and his
song in caricature of "Bldelia" was
one of the few nearly good things of
the performance. Sam Simpson as
Lanty Hogan'was inoffensive. G. W.
Kno.Vs Sir LiUCius Brantford was
probably the very worst thing seen on
a San Francisco stage in many a day.
None of the women rose above medldc
rlty, although Sadie Marion as Kath
leen O'Neill and Pauline Seldon v as
Moliie Doolan at lenst meant well. Lit
tle Baby Patti did a pleasing child act.
Of the rest the less said the better.
The audience guyed the performance
liberally.
lecher**.
"ROly-Poly" IJontinues to attract
crowds to Fischer's Theater. Â»
Central.
A melodrama that bids fair to crowd
the house for the rest of the week
opened at. the Central Theater last
night â "The King of the Opium Ring."
It was well staged and costumed and
mdde a decided hit. The thrilling
scenes and startling climaxes were the
occasion of many bursts of applause,
and the characters were strong and
well sustained.
Chutes.
The Melnotte sisters, two . dashing
singing and dancing soubrettes, madfr
great hits at both performances at the
Chutes yesterday, as did also TIppel
and Kltment. unusually clever musical
comedians. Ziska and Kin?, "the ma
gician and his valet." gave a very
amusing turn, and Kelly and Violette,
"the fashion plate singing duo"; Irving
Jonfs,- the .diminutive colored individu
al who writes his own smigs, and Mabel
Lamson. the contralto finger of illus
trated all had new specialties
to Offer. The animatoscope
a capital programme. On account of the
damp weather the promised display of
fireworks did not take place. The ama
teurs will appear on Thursday night.
Fire nt Tread well Mine**.
SEATTLE, Feb. 22.â A special to
the Post-Intelligencer from Skagway
says the Treadwell Y. M. C. A. build
ing, the best equipped institution of
the kind in Alaska, maintained by the
employes at the Treadwell group of
mines, burned to the ground early
Friday morning, together' with five
other buildings. The loss will exceed
$15,000, covered by $8000 insurance.

QUICK TRIP FROM NORTH
Broker Henderson of Chicago
Finds 3Ieans for* Overcoming
'Delay Caused by a Landslide
T. S. Henderson, head of a prominent
brokerage firm of St. Louis, and his
attorney, Judge Fred W. Fickett of
Chicago, accompanied by Daniel Mc-
Carthy of Oakland and Charles Thomp
son of this city, arrived here yesterday
morning from Redding after one of the
swiftest trips ever made by a Southern
Pacific train over that section of It9
big system. Henderson and Fickett
had been spending several days ln
Redding in connection with a big mill
ing deal in Arizona and had made ar
rangements "to leave there Sunday
afternoon so as to meet parties here
regarding the same business matter
at 9 o'clock yesterday morning. The
regular train from the north passe3
through Redding at 6 o'clock in the
evening and it was nearly that hour
Sunday when Henderson and his com
panion learned that owing to a land
slide at Roseburtf. Of., the train was
many hours late.
It was of vital importance to the two
thatthey should be at the Palace at 9
a. m. yesterday, and appreciating their
predicament Henderson entered into
negotiations with the railroad officials
for a special train, which they finally
got, it being agreed by the company,
that the travelers should reach"" hete
in ample time to keep their appoint
ment. Although the. company prom
ifed to haul them out of Redding at 11
o'clock Sunday night It was not until
12:30 yesterday morning that the spe
cial was got under way, but the loss
of time was soon made up, for the train,
consisting of an engine, coach and a
fiatcar, maintained a high rate of speed
the entire distance.
The train came south by the longer
route, it being figured that time could
be saved by avoiding the necessity of
a transfer on the Benicia ferry. Tele
graphic arrangements had been made
for a special boat at the Oakland pier,
which wag reached at 6 o'clock yester
day morning, and four minutes later
Henderson and Fickett and their two
guests were on their way across the
bay.
The party arrived at the Palace Hotel
with plenty of time to spare and finally
kept their appointment. At the meet-
Ing, however, it was discovered that a
number of telegrams received from the
East and bearing importantly on the
mining deal, had been sent in cipher, a
code of which was not to be had until
late last eventng. so they had really
accomplished little by their fast and
expensive trip from Redding, other
than to establish their good faith in
the deal for the purchase of a copper
property which is said to be one of the
richest In the West.

TO INVESTIGATE
IRREGULARITIES
Grand Jury Coramittoe to Begin
Inquiry Into Alleged Jobbery
in the Almshouse Supplies
INDICTMENTS 3IAY FOLLOW
Testimony Will Be Taken as to
Why the Leg-al Specifications
Were Not Strictly Adhered To
The Health Department Committee
of the Grand Jury will begin to-day
to take testimony in relation to the
alleged jobbery in the furnishing of
supplies to the City and County Alms
house under the administration for
which ex-Mayor Phelan is responsible.
The committee to which the latest
Fcandal in municipal affairs was re
ferred, in conjunction with its regular
inquiry lnlo the operations of the va
rious city Institutions under the juris
diction of the Board of Health, is com
posed of Ira B. DaJziel (chairman), Her
bert Law and J. H. Mundy. The com
mittee has mapped out the lines upon
which the inquiry will be pursued, and
if the evidence shows any wrongdoing
on the part of contractors or employes
at the Almshouse indictments are sure
to f olkrw,
The scope and powers of the Grand
Jury committees are limited to the
gathering of testimony regarding any
dereliction on the part of the officials
of the municipal departments. After
their report has been prepared it is
submitted to the Grand Jury proper,
and en the findings of the committee
will depend the bringing of true bills
against the offending parties.
WILL TAKE EVIDENCE.
The first part of the inquiry will be
directed to the examination of the spec
ifications upon which the various 'con
tractors furnished their supplies. After
this is definitely settled in the minds
of the members of the committee evi
dence will be taken both from the em
ployes of the Almshouse and the con
tractors themselves as to the kind of
Roods supplied to the institution, which
were pronounced of inferior quality
and lacking in quantity by the com
mittee of the Health Board which first
uncovered the irregularities.
The contractors that will be called
tipon to explain their transactions with
the Almshouse include F. Uri & Co.
and Ryan & Ryan. The Health Board
Committee reported that cow's meat
had been furnished the city's poor in
stead of steer's meat, as the specifica
tions called for. As the latter is much
inferior to the former and costs less it
is clear that some one profited by the
nllesred substitution, and on this point
T'ri & Co.. who had the meat contract,
â¢rfU be closely questioned.
WEIGHT OF BLANKETS.
Ryan & Ryan furnished the blankets,
which the Health Board Committee
found were underweight. The specifi
cations called for five-pound blankets,
while those furnished only weighed
four pounds, it is claimed, and did not
have the name of the Almshouse
woven in them
Other alleged irregularities to be
probed by the committee include the
furnishing of half-barrels of pork and
charging for full barrels; the purchase
of Fix inferior milch cows; syrup that
did not accord with the specifications,
and the purchase of a horse at double
the value of the animal.
Judcing from the manner in which
the alleged irregularities were carried
on it is the general opinion that there
was collusion among some employes at
the Almshouse, and in that event those
who offended will certainly lose their
positions, even if something of a graver
character does not happen to them.

PHYSICIANS DISCUSS THE DEPLORABLE
STATE OF CITY AND COUNTY HOSPITAL
Second Day's Session, of the Third Annual State Conference of
Charities and Corrections Is Prolific of Valuable Papers on
Subjects of General' Interest Pertaining to Public Institutions
The second day of the third annual
session of the State Conference of
Charities and Corrections was com
pleted yesterday. Quite a large crowd
was present and it listened to several
papers, all of them dealing with med
icine and the treatment of disease.
The City and County Hospital was
the subject of much discussion at the
morning session. Papers on this in
stitution were read by Dr. Emmet Rlx
ford and Dr. William Watt Kerr. The
subject was discussed by Dr. James
Ward, president of the city Board of
Health, and Dr. A. W. Clark of the
Alameda County Hospital.
Dr. Rixford said:
To answer the question of whether the eer-
Tlce to the, sick poor is what it should be Is a
clmple matter, for every one who knows any
thing at ajl abont the City and County Hospi
tal knows that it is not, but to put the thing In
euch a manner that It will bear fruit In stimu
lating effort to better the institution is not so
Flmple. To those who live in San Francisco
and vicinity I can tell nothing about the insti
tution or" lta management â there is nothing
new to tell or to tell of. I was going to say
that there Is nothing new In the City and
County Hospital, nor has there been for the
last thirty years.
San Francisco has never had reason to be
proud of her municipal hospital, and she has
donÂ© but mighty little to better things since
the days when the present building was erected
as a temporary structure to house the patients
while a proper permanent building was being
constructed. She has lain apathetic while
other cities of her size and importance have
all etriven to keep pace with the march of
science and art in the care of the sick. She
has been left far In the rear by all the great
American cities, till to-day she can bos*t If
ehe would of the poorest built, the poorest
equipped and the most niggardly supported
municipal hospital of any city of her size In
America. And the condition of things is not
likely to be materially improved till the public
appreciates the facts in the. case and demands
a better state of things, and just here It seems
to me Is one of the fields In which this confer
ence can be of great assistance to the Institu
tion In helping to mold public opinion In Its
favor.
NEED NEW BDUiDING.
That the general public Is beginning to ap
preciate the needs of the City and County Hos
pital Is shown by the fact that in a recent
election the city voted to Issue bonds to the
amount of a million dollars for the erection of
a new building.
Another speaker will present to you a state
ment of how munificently our 'thrifty city sup
ports its charity hospital and will compare It
with similar Institutions In other cities. Suf
fice It for me to say that San Francisco ap
propriates less per patient than any other hos
pital with which we would like to compare
our Institution. The appropriation varies from
CO to TO cents a day per patient, including sal
aries. Of j thirty similar hospitals in Ameri
can cities fifteen I spend â  more than twice as
much and generally their salary list is smaller
In proportion. Have we a -right to expect our
Board of Health to give service comparable to
that In these . hospitals on less than half the
amount of money to dolt with? You will see
figures which will show that the cost of raw
food is less than In nearly all such Institu
tions. It Is 17 and 18 cents a day per person
fed â but a large proportion of the persons fed
are officers and employes, whose fare â none
too goodâ Is ' more expensive than that given
to the patients.
I have said that the salary list Is some
what larger than In Eastern hospitals, but,
considering the higher wages in San Pran
cIeco, It is not disproportionately so. But the
Individual -salaries are In some Instances ri
dicuolously low,, which simply means that the
institution has a larger number of employes
and that these employes are Incompetent and
cannot if they would give proper service. AÂ«
you will see. the large number of employes
contains a ridiculously email number of nurses
â which means that there Is a still greater
predominance of the inefficient help.
The Influence cf a lot of conscientious young
women In such an institution is not to be ex
aggerated, a physician who visited our city
from Massachusetts not long since, and who is
deeply Interested in the problems of hospital
management. *pent most of his time while
here in visiting the various public and private
hospitals. He found much to commend, but
also much to criticize. His attention was par
ticularly attracted to the character of the
nursing service in the City and County Hospital
and the relatively entail number of nurses as
compared with similar institutions In the East.
So convinced was he of the beneficent Influence
of women in the hospital that he was wont to
m:it> up the situation in the statement that a
hospital Is clean, the food well served, the
comfort of the patients assured In proportion
to the amount of control in the management of
<he affairs of the institution put in the hands
of the women.
Dr. Ward said:
From all that you bare . heard - and all that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1904.
you have read, you have no doubt concluded
that the City and County Hospital Is the
daikest hospital and the darkest managed hos
pital In the world.
The Board of Health has Its face set toward
a betterment. While Its' existence Is provided
by the charter, it is not a board of political
doctors. If the charter forces the medical man
into a. life on the Board of Health, that man
should not be ridiculed when he is trying to do
what the charter prescribes.
The policy of the present *board is to do away
with committee rule at the City and County
Hospital. J We have established new rules and
regulations, for the government of the hospital
patients and employes. The new regulations
have been taken from the best hospitals in
Chicago and New York.
The Board of Health cannot give you a new
hospital at once, but we can Rive you a cleaner
and more sanitary one than you now have.
The condition of cleanliness shall extend as
Tar us possible In an old building-, and shall
extern! to every department In the building.
SPEAKERS AT THE SECOND DAY'S
SESSION OF STATE CONFERENCE
OF CHARITIES AND CORRECTIONS.
We have formerly had no reception room at
the hospital. Of- late we have arranged to have
a room where patients applying for admission
can be examined without the publicity exist
ing before.
SEGREGATING CONSUMPTIVES.
Tubercular patients are now scattered
throughout the hospital. We are arranging: to
put them outside in another building, that they
may be given the benefit of the latest and
most successful methods of treating the dread
disease. ThiÂ» will be better for the consump
tive and better for the other patients.
The new Health Board has decided to run
the hospital for the good of the city. Certainly
the board has no ulterior motive. The staff
of nurses was formerly totally Inadequate, but
it has , been increased so that now we have
' two nurses to each ward during the day and
one in each at night. The force haa been in
creased to sixty, giving us latitude for sick
ness among nurses and allowing for nurses to
attend the operations.
The visiting physicians are allowed to prac
tically govern the hospital. There are flve
staffs, and each staff Is allowed to appoint a
director. Each of the directors is appointed
from the physicians of the hospital. The di
rectors meet once a month and discuss the
welfare of the hospital and make suggestions
to the Board of Health, so that the public can
now read-- the government of the Institution.
Tho attitude of the board toward the attaches
of the hocpital is as broad as it can be made.
Dr. Kerr said:
In the surgical department of the City and
County Hospital the patients were compelled
to' depend on the convalescent patients and
medical students for assistance. The nursing
was equally bad. Medicines were not properly
attended to or administered. nor regularly
given. With the advent of the new nurses,
things have been changed. We now have a
cleaner, better â¢service. We have not now
nearly enough nurses. Some of them are com
pelled to do a thirty-six or forty-hour, watch.
The nursing staff is not adequate for the work.
EXPENSES NOW GREATER.
.The medical requirements are not adequate.
The expenses to-day are greater than they
were rive years ago. Surgery has advanced so
that where an appendicitis patient was al
lowed to die, he is now operated on and suc
cessfully cured. Diphtheria is now treated with
anti-toxins, so that the disease has been robbed
of its danger. The anti-toxin is expensive and,
if we are going to practice modern surgery, we
must have funds.
The bacteriological laboratories in use at the
hospital are not run at the expense of the city,
the hospital are run at the expense of the city.
The niedlcal colleges installed them for the
benefit of their students and have maintained
them ever since. The colleges are doing a
great deal for the city In this respect..
The present building Is totally inadequate
for ths number of patients confined In it.
"Wards are overtaxed. Wards built for twenty
five patients are compelled to house forty. Then
some one makes a howl that! a patient has been
refused aJmission to the hospital. The forty
beds In one ward are given but 850 cubic feet
of air. It should not be less than 1500 cubic
feet, and I do not know of any modern building
that does not tlve to each forty beds from
1800 to 2000 cubic feet.
The site of the hospital is the best that can
be obtained. A city and county hospital should
be centrally located to be of the greatest good.
There Is a feeling that the management should
be entirely divorced from politics (applause).
Two of the trustees should be of the staff of
visiting physicians and be elected by members
of the Ftaff. The trouble with the City and
County Hospital Is that its management, has
been left too much to an executive head, who
knows nothing of the wants or needs of the
patient. The management should be given to
the men who associate daily with the patients
and are In a position to know their wants.
SHARP CONTRAST MADE.
Dr. Clark of Alameda read a paper
on the improvements made in the
Public Hospital of Alameda County.
A vivid contrast with the condition of
the Public Hospital of this city, was
shown.
Charles A. Murdock, representing the
Merchants' Association, gave a brief
talk, comparing the San Francisco
hospital with those of other cities. He
said:
A man from the East, unprejudiced. Investi
gated our hospital tr^ said It was the worst
institution of Its klnd~n the entire world. The
dangers from disease In Chinatown, In his
opinion, are not in it with those of the City
and County Hospital.
The city pours out money lavishly for the
securing of a convention of the Knights of
Pythias and for the building of a monument
to Dewey, who destroyed a bunch of tin ships
at Manila, but when It comes ' to- caring for
our sick, what have we done? . " â  %:
In the beet hospital In the United States
the average cos|, per patient per day is $1 96.
In San Francisco the amount provided is but
â¢:-s cents. Hospitals in the East 'have one
nurse to every three patients, . while In San
Francisco we have . but one to. every ten pa
tients. We have no detention ward j for pa
tients with infectious diseases. In other cit
ies the amount spent for raw food per day
per rtatlent Is 30 cents: in thie city It Is
but 1" cenu. These are the things we have
to think "of most.
John Chetwood made an address on
the legal aspect of the "Hospital Site
Question." He said:
Some time prior to last fall's bond election
the Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance
â electing the Almshouse Tract'aa the site of
the new city and County Hospital. Just be
fore the election Information as to the Im
provements to be voted for, their cost. | char
acter, etc., . was published in the j press, I and
In contemDtatlon of .law all voters were ap
prised of the facts and figures thus, published.'
This publication did not, however, directly
designate the Almshouse Tract as the hospital
site, but only referred by number and title
to the resblution by which it had been se
lected. The charter does not require the Su
pervisors to select a Â«ite In advance or to
supply information to the voters on this point.
Under the circumstances, and the authorities,
it does not seem clear whether the board is
or is not bound to adhere to the site selected.
And If public welfare requires a change a
proper application can be made to the board
to make one. If the board accedes to the de
mand for a change, an appropriate action on
its part looking' to one can be made the basis
of an injunction to test its power in the
But such injunction proceeding should not
be allowed to embarrass, impede or affect the
suit to test the validity of the entire bond
Issue, which has Just been brought In the
Superior Court, and on which it Is most Im
portant to have a ruling as sÂ«oon as possible.

LOVE AND RUM
CAUSE MURDER
Barkeeper Evans Is Suffocated
and His Consort Half Dead
After a Drunken Quarrel
ROOM IS FILLED WITH GAS
Woman Mad With Liquor and
Jealousy Is Believed to Have
Turned On the Deadly Fluid
Love, jealousy and intemperance in
judiciously mingled caused a murder
and an attempted suicide last Sunday
night in the lodging-house at 624 Kear
ny street. As the result of a slighted
woman's rage William Henry Evans
lies, on a slab in the Morgue and Annie
Newton, a dive waitress, is in the hos
pital being treated for carbon monoxide
poisoning.
Evans was 25 years old and was em
ployed as a bartender at 911 Kearny
street. He and the woman had been
consorting together for several months.
On Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock they
arrived at their lodgings drunk and
quarrelsome. One of the Inmates -named
Florence Bell informed Deputy Coroner
Charles Meehan that Evans threw the
Newton woman out "of the room and
threatened to have nothing further to
do with her. After the woman had
pleaded for a while he relented and al
lowed her to re-enter. It was then that
she declared that if Evans should at
tempt to cast her off she would commit
suicide or turn on the gas on both of
them.
F. A. Emerson, a friend of Evans,
called at midnight, and receiving no re
sponse to his knocks notified Landlord
Siersted and suggested that he should
force an entrance, but the landlord
said that they were in a drunken sleep
and he did not wish them to be dis-
turbed.
Emerson called again at 8:30 o'clock
yesterday morning and knocked again
at Â»the door of the room occupied by
Evans *and the Newton woman. Not
obtaining a reply and detecting the
odor of illuminating gas, Emerson
forced the door leading from the ad
joining room to Evans' and found
Evans lying dead across the bed, fully
dressed except his shoes. The woman
was in her nightgown, unconscious. The
keyhole was plugged with the end of a
towel. Two burners feeding a gas cook
ing stove were open. The woman was
taken to the Harbor Hospital for medi
cal treatment and the body of the man
sent to the Morgue. The hospital sur
geon says the woman will die.
interesting paper on "Modern Methods
in the Care anS Treatment of Insane."
Dr. Hatch said in part:
The best way to treat insane people is to
care for their morals. .We should have a hos
pital for the keeping and treating of the
slightly affected insane, so that they might
be kept from the asylums. There are many
cases of alcoholic ipsanity that would never
BO farther than this hospital. If there was
such a hospital these cases micht be easily
studied and better treated. If the cases are
incurable or acute, then the subjects can be
assigned to an asylum.
The hospital should be equipped with build
ings for the holding of subjects for observa
tion. Many cases of insanity, if quickly
treated, can be readily cured.
There should be wards where the conval
escents can be placed. The Insane not con
sidered hopeless cases should be provided
with work. A colony might be established,
where they could be put to work and get
plenty of exercise. I think that the State
should do away with the legal process in com
mitting subjects to the asylums; do away
with any semblance of criminality or courts
In the committing of weak-minded people.
Discussion of Dr. Hatch's paper wa3
opened by Dr. A. W. Hoisholt of the
Stockton State Hospital. He said:
The State hospitals of California are up with
any in the world, as far as housing and feed
ing are concerned. But in the treatment, the
insane do not fare as well as they, do in some
of the European countries, such as Germany.
Our hospitals are not equipped for treatment
of the subjects. Xhe person committed for
weak-mindedness Is as much a sick patient and
deserves treatment as much as any sick per
son. We need â¢ more means for treating the
insane. Merely housing and feeding them does
nothing toward their recovery.
I should advise a State institution where the
insane in cases not pronounced incurable might
be treated. It should be located near the Bay
of San Fjanclsco.
DRINK AS A CAUSE.
We have three prime causes; of insanity, I
which help to fill our asylums. Much of the j
correction of these causes can be done by char
itable institutions and cannot be done at the
asylums, " where it is too late. I refer mainly
to alcoholism. In a certain part of Germany j
,1 visited an asylum where 90 per cent of the !
inmates were victims cf drink. In others the I
percentage was 43 per cent. Another cause of I
insanity is that dread disease syphilis. Twen
ty-five per cent of all the cases I know of
have resulted from this terrible disease. The !
last cause is intermarriage of persons afflicted j
with some disease, causing the offspring to be
affected by heredity. Tne task of correcting |
these enumerated causes is Utopian, I know, but j
much can be done by a body like this which
undertakes the work in the right way.
' W. A. Gates, secretary of the State
Board of Charities and Corrections,
also spoke on the subject introduced
by Dr. Hatch. He said:
We should get over the idea that when a
person shows signs of mental derangement or
brain disease he must be dragged into court
by, the Sheriff. They say that it Is the law
that no man shall be deprived of his liberty
without due process of law. -A person found I
to have contracted smallpox is, not given a
trial, but' is hustled out to the pesthouse.
NEEDS OF STATE HOME.
There is too much tendency to fix a stigma
on a person who is weak minded. The only
way to get at the seat of the trouble is to re
move everything that Eavors of courts and
criminality.
"The Needs of the State Home for
Feeble-minded Children" was the sub
ject of a paper read by Dr. William
J. G. Dawson, Medical Superintendent
of the Home for the Feeble-minded at
Glen Ellen, Sonoma County. Dr. Daw
son told of the needs of the home in
the way of finances and new buildings.
He said that the institution was totally
inadequate for the number of persons
in it. A waiting list has to be main
tained, he says, so that the. place does
not become overcrowded. Many fami
lies have been waiting for three or
four years to get some one in the
home.
At the night session Andrew M. Da
vis, president of the .Charities Indorse
ment Committee of San Francisco,*
read. a paper on "The Charities In
dorsement Committee and . Its Aims."
Davis told of the work of the investi
gating committee in the matter of reg
ulating the donations tc charitable in
situtions.
".What the Associated Charities
Stand For" was the subject of a talk
given by Dr. Samuel G. Smith of St.
Paul. The discussion of the subject
was introduced by Osyood Putnam,
president of the. Associated Charities
of San .Francisco. : ...

the close of his remarks a great volley
of applause showed conclusively upon
which side the sympathy leaned.

observation, which led him to advofcate
it as a righteous war.

against Japan, which, though patient
for a length of time, had grown worn
