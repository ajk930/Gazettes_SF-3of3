ST. PETERSBURG, June 1. â The
reports of an attack upon Count
Lamsdorff, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, have their foundation in the per
sonal assault committed on Monday
evening by Prince Dolgorouky, a dis
appointed office seeker. The Prince is
an opponent of Count Lamsdorff's pol
icy and' is said to have become insane
through brooding over his alleged
grievances.
The. Prince met Count Lamsdorff in
the street on Monday evening, and
without warning struck him on the
head with a walking stick. In so do
ing he is said to have calmly announc
ed that he chastised the Foreign Min
ister in the name of the whole Rus
sian people. Police agents rushed to
the scene and seized the Prince, who
immediately handed them a card, say
ing it was a private affair. Neverthe
less he was placed under arrest.
The Emperor is highly indignant
over the episode and has directed an
immediate medical examination of the
Prince in order that it may be legally
determined whether he is sane. If he
is pronounced insane Prince Dolgor
ouky will be placed in an asylum. If
he is responsible for his actions he
will be punished.

IRONTON. Ohio, June 1.â The arrest

groups to discuss it. Both sides to the
controversy. assumed a threatening-at

critical. He thereupon called for troops
and his call was approved by the Gov

When the troops arrived this after
noon Hanging Rock was placed under

persed. Harvey Reed, who refused to
obey the troops, was arrested. James

A private letter from Liaoyang, dated
May 24, says that on good authority
General Kuropatkin then had 140,000
men ready to take the field.
The War Office does not believe the
report : "from Tokio that a Japanese
division has embarked for Northern
Korea to check an alleged advance of
Lieutenant General , Llnevitch's artny.
A high military official points out that
Linevitch would have to march 300
miles dyer difficult roads and to assure
supplies for that distance before he
could get within striking distance of
the Japanese army.
This authority admits that such a
task is impossible and not worth at
tempting, since it would imperil the
Japanese supplies in Manchuria, ( whlch
are coming by sea. The Japanese are
more likely to reinforce their armies
in Southern Manchuria, on the Liao
tung Peninsula, where it is_. believed
they are concentrating every available
man.
The admiralty attributes the failure
to destroy the crippled cruiser Bogatyr
to the absence of Japanese warships
near Vladivostok. .1
"The Japanese detachment which our
cavalry, successfully engaged on' May
SO is now stationed four versts from
Vagenfuchu, fortifying Its position.
"There has been no further Japanese
advance from Saimatza toward Feng
chowling Pass on the Liaoyang road."
. "On May 30 two camps of Japanese
infantry and thirty dragoons advanced
along the Takushan road toward Ona
lassi for the purpose of turning the left
flank of our outposts. Our scouts dis
covered the movement and fighting en
sued, in the course of which one Cos-
Back was wounded and one horse was
killed. â¢ ', â¢Â¦
"All is quiet' in the direction of Feng
wangcheng. Siuyen has not been oc

in an easterly -direction
."Rear Admirals Wittsoeft and Grlg
orovltch report that up to May 28 num
erous Japanese mines had been discov
ered and exploded in the roadstead of
Port Arthur. The Japanese evidently
have replaced the fire ships, which
they formerly used, by mines, sown by
merchant steamships in their service."
The Emperor has received the follow
ing dispatch from General Kuropatkin,
dated May 31: ' ' -
ST. PETERSBURG; June 1.â An un
confirmed rumor has reached here from
Mukden that the 'Japanese battleship
Fuji is aground on a reef off the Miao
tao islands, between tne Kwantung
and Shantung promontpries, where she
is being guarded by torpedo boats.
The following dispatch from Viceroy
Alexieff to the Emperor, dated May 31,
has been received here:
The correspondent of the Standard at
Tokio announces that non-combatants
are quitting Gensan on account of the
incursions of small parties of Russians
into Northeastern Korea. The situation
there Is not deemed a serious one.
Against these statements must be
placed the official denial, communicated
to the press and already cabled, that
General Kuropatkin would move south
ward.
"A recent council of war decided that
General Kuropatkin should risk an en
gagement. The Empfror deferred to
this Judgment, even going so far as to
authorize the dispatch of troops from
the German frontier to the Far East,
on the ground that as Germany w-as
benevolent she might be trusted safely.
All hopes are centered now in Kuro
patkin, who will make desperate efforts
to save Port Arthur."
No confirmation has yet been re
ceived of the reported heavy fight
ing near Port Arthur or with General
Kuropatkin's army, although the lat
ter is not regarded as improbable.
Rumors persist that court influence
at St. Petersburg is being actively ex
.erclsed "to induce General Kuropat
kin to assume the offensive in an en
deavor by a victory to retrieve the
Russian military reputation. The
Daily Telegraph's St. Petersburg cor
respondent says:
LONDON. June 2. â The Moscow
correspondent of the Times learns that
Harbin is to be fortified speedily
against the contingency of a siege.
Heavy siege guns have left St. Peters
burg already, really intended for Har
bin, and others' will' be sent from
Kronstadt and other first-class fort
resses for the same purpose.
A painful impression has been pro
duced by General Kuropatkin's in
sistence on the necessity of making
timely provision for a retreat to Har
bin.
The Cossacks picked up boots which
had been taken off by the Japanese in
order to facilitate the flight and /lour
itshed them on their lances as trophies.
The Japanese used the Boer trick of
displaying dummies, but the Cossacks
did not waste a shot on the: General
Samsomoff highly praised the practice
of the Russian gunners.
KAICHOU, Liaotung Peninsula.
June 1. â A Russian who was wounded
in the fight near the station at Vagen
fuchu May 30, says General Samsomoff
attacked the Japanese near the . rail
road a mile from Vagenfuchu station.
A cornet of the frontier gur.rds was the
herp of the fight. His sergeant was
lying wounded and a Japanese officer
was about to ride over him when the
cornet unhorsed the Japanese, mounted
the latter's horse and placed the ser
geant on his own charger. .The Jap
anese cavalry engaged was the Thir
teenth Regiment. Its horses were
splendid animals. S
LIAOYANG,: Monday, May 30.â The
Japanese lost 200 killed and a number
of horses in the fight at Vagenfuchu
to-day. The Russians opened fire at 8
o'clock in the morning and after two
hours and a half of long range^ firing
the. Japanese, under General Akklama,
prepared to charge and crush the
force which had been harassing them
for twenty-one days. In the mean
time Oeneral Samsomoff was ap
proaching Vagenfuchu with a strong
force of cavalry.
It was a sight worth seeing, when at
the | word of command the ' Russian
squadrons formed and rushed like a
whirlwind across the terribly .cut up
country, clearing away all obstacles,
the batteries at the same time trotting
along the frightful roads.
Having passed the railroad station,
the. troops came . under "the fire of the
Japanese machine guns, but withdrew
without suffering much loss. The
Fourth and Sixth companies of the
Eighth Siberian Cossacks furiously
charged the Japanese cavalry with
lances, attacking both flanks. In a few
minutes' they literally cut the whole
squadron to* pieces. This was the first
time lances were used and they struck
terror into the enemy. In some cases
the ' lances pierced the riders
through and wounded their horses.
Some of the lances could not be with
drawn from the bodies Into which they
had entered.
The Japanese infantry, numbering
four battalions of 300 men to a com
pany, and eight squadrons at cavalry,
attempted to advance, but the Russian
batteries opened and soon the slope up
which the enemy was advancing was
covered with black spots and the en
emy was forced _to scatter and retire.
Some of the Japanese cavalry were
wonderfully dashing, charging with
shouts upon the Russians, who met and
scattered them. .
A Cossacl who had lost his lance
and sword wrenched a sword from a
Japanese officer and cut off the officer's
head.
"Those Japanese fight well. Shoot
ing is their strong point/but the Cos
sacks' lance charge completely sur
prised them. Many of the Japanese
were ridden down, i Others ceased fir
ing' and.. fled.". . '. . â¢
MUKDEN/ June 1. â A hospital
train arrived last night with; wounded
from the fighting at Vagenfucho^
bringing three officers and twenty
three, men. General Kuropatkin vis

their bravery and awarded eight
crosses of; St. George.- Four of those
wounded, at Vagenfuchu_ were left at
LiaotunV in too seriousT a condition
to be moved. Some of these have from

TUCSON, Ariz., June 1.â After a. ten
days' chase, \ Tom Rlnning, captain* of
the rangers, and JacK Foster, the
plucky little Deputy United States
Marshal, yesterday captured Will
Woods and Kid Fluker near Paradise,
a new town in Cochise County.
Woods and Fluker are the two most
notorious men of the road In this
country and the officers knew that
they could not be taken without a fight.
The officers caught the trail of the
renegades at Paradise, striking that
camp a few hours after they had left.
At the San Simon ranch, Kinnijig. and
Foster were but a short distance.be
hind the fugitives and a few miles
further on they came upon the out
laws cooking their noon meal outside
of a lonely cabin in the foothills.
Fluker and his partner took refuge
in the cabin and, poking their rifles
out between the logs, opened fire. The
officers ran behind trees and rocks and
then put bullet after bullet through the
cracks of the cabin, compelling the out
laws to lie flat on the floor. In which
position the-v could do very little firing.
In this way Rinning and Foster closed
In on the cabin and made a rush for
the door. The outlaws surrendered;.
They were taken to Nogales, as- the
crimes for 'which they will be tried
were committed in Santa Cruz County.

Briefly stated, the Gayley process of
making steel is a modification of the
Bessemer process, which revolutionized
iron and steel industries. The process
will be applied to the manufacture of
pig iron as well as steel. Friends of
Gayley assert that the process will
greatly cheapen the cost of production.
For years Gayley has been working
on the process. He has recently told
his friends that his experiments con
ducted at the Isabella furnaces in the
Pittsburg district 'belonging to the
United States Steel Corporation have
Indicated that the new method will
prove a practical success. It Is under
stood that they have resulted In reduc
ing the moisture of the air applied in
the converting of ore to pig iron and
steel. Other new features have also
been introduced. â¢ ;.

men, the foundation of which was laid
when was laid the keels of the Charles

Monadnock, will enable you to demand
that your navy yard be given a chance

The banquet ended the day's demon
stration and was a most enjoyable af
fair. It was presided over by George
J. Campbell, secretary of the Vallejo
Chamber of Commerce.
Toastmaster Campbell called upon
Senator Perkins to respond to the
toast, "Our Honored Guests." The
response of the Senator was a-felici- ;
tous one, a3 was also the response of
Lieutenant Governor AJden Anderson
to the toast .of "California."
Walter* MacArthur responded to the
toast of "Organized Labor and Its Re
lation to the Navy Yard." The re
sponse of Frank R. Devlin, president
of the Vallejo Chamber of Commerce,
to the toast, "The Vallejo Chamber of
Commerce," brought forth hearty
cheers from the banqueters and a simi
lar reception was given the remarks of
CorÂ»gressman V. H. Metcalf, who, when
called upon, told what he knew of
"Governmental Shipbuilding."
James Roney, Vallejo's Mavor, told
what he knew of "Vallejo, Its Past,
Present and Future," and Mayor
Schmitz responded to the toast, "The
City of San Francisco."
The "United States Navy" was the
toast to which Rear -Admiral B. H. Mc-
Calla was called to respond. His re
marks were remarkably trite and
brought home to his hearers the fact
that "The Navy," as viewed from the
standpoint of Admiral McCalla, is an
institution of which we should be
proud. .
Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz took the
place of Congressman Bell, when the
latter, while the- cheers of the Vallejo
ites rang in his ears, stepped from the
bridge. Mayor Schmitz was given a
hearty greeting. His speech was very
short and was practically a repetition
of the words of the men who had pre
ceded him. He closed his remarks with
the wish that the mechanics of Mare
Island and the men of Vallejo would
seriously take the words of Senator
Perkins and Congressmen Bell and
Metcalf.

NORTHERN LEADER HERE.
Henry T. Oxnard of Ventura County,
one of the leading Republican aspir
ants for a seat In the United Statea
Senate, is in the city again, having
arrived from the south yesterday
morning. His position as a candidate
for Senatorial honors hasTbeen frankly
defined and is clearly "understood by
the Republicans of California.. Mr.
Oxnard will doubtless Impart consider
able activity to the campaign and will
surely use every honorable effort to
promote the election of Republican
nominees for the Legislature. It is
the general opinion of politicians that
this State will give an overwhelming
majority for Theodore Roosevelt for
President. Indications at this time
point to Republican supremacy in both
branches of the Legislature. The spir
ited contest in the south between Mr.
Oxnard and â¢ Senator Bard will insure
Republican victory in doubtful Assem
bly districts. The Democrats may be
come so Interested in the Republican
contest that they will neglect to make^
nominations for the Legislature..
Following this victory Daniel J.
Campau was re-elected national com
mitteeman from Michigan and of the
four delegates at large not one was
a member of the Hearst element.
The first test of strength. was on the
report from the committe on creden

INDORSEMENT. OP "BRYAN. ;
Democracy 'would restore- the tariff' to a
revenue basis and administer It for revenue
only, thus derr.olithimj the legal bulwarks be
hind which the, predatory trusts have found
r-fuge. Protection for protection's aake Is an
Ingenious device for the exploitation of the
masses by the privileged classes; It has
wrought jrreat injustice to the consumers and
has U-n the- fruitful course of widespread
political corruption.
Democracy would administer the Treasury
Department In behalf of the public, not, as
now, in the Interest of Wall street. It would
prevent the , recolnase of legal tender, silver
dollars Into, limited - legal tender subsidiary
coin. It wou.Id secure to the people a volume
of standard money sufficient to keep pace
: with the demand for money. It would favor
p*pÂ«r money Issued by the Government without
the Intervention of national banks. It would
resist the attempt to establish .asset currency
and branch banks, and it would oppose the
lOnnlng of Government Â¦ money to favored
banks â a scheme by which the people's money
Is employed to lay a foundation for a cam
paign fund and to bribe the financial In
terests to oppose any reduction of taxation.
The present admln!Â«tratlon of thÂ« Treasury
Department Is' progressively beneficial to tha
crpltalistlc classes and progressively harmful
to .the producers of wealth. â¢ .-.':;*..'â¢:/
INCOME TAX ADVOCATED.
' Democracy would make taxation more
equitable by collecting a part of the revenues
from an income tax, jipcured by a constitutional
amendment, and would bring ahe Government
'.nearer to the people by the popular election
of United States Senators and direct legis
lation.
Democracy, would strictly regulate the rall
roadt, thus protecting farmers and merchant*
- fri-m >xcÂ«Â«glve rates and discriminations.
â¢ Democracy would safeguard the interests . of
the wage-earner and the artisan by providing
for an eight-hour day: by substituting arbi
tration for strikes and lockouts, and by re
storing- the right of trial by Jury. now. sus
pended by Government by Injunction. -
Democracy would secure to the surviving
tiddler* and sailors and their dependents gen
erous pension*,- not by an arbitrary executive
order, but by legislation which a grateful peo
ple Ktand r*>ady to enact. Â¦
' Democracy would cqnetruct an.. Isthmian
car.al without, a violation of treaty obligations
and without exciting suspicion armjng- our
eiRter republics, of Central and South America,
â¢ Democracy would retrard public office as
a pvbllc trust, provide for ari honest, and
pcoTiomical ndmlnlstratinn. of . the Government
aixl punish with severity the betrayal of of
ficial duty.
Democracy has nothing to gain from ftm
bigulty and nothing to fear from the' light.
Democratic' platforms tihoulrt. therefore, net
forth Democratic principles, policies and pur
poses wfth frankness, clearness and definlte
rse**.
Democracy would relieve the country of th*
menace of militarism and Imperialism by fol
lowing the exaicule rtt by tb.Â» country In Its
dealings with Cuba ana giving the Philip
pints an immediate promUÂ» of ultimate In
dependence. Th<? administration of a colonial
system, according to monarchial principles, is
repugnant to cur theory of eovernment and
cannot be defended without the assertion of
doctrines which, if carried out. will under
mine free Ko.vC-rnment In the United States-
OPPOSES COLOXIAIj SYSTEM.
The. platform is as follows:
We. the Democrats of the State of Nebraska.
li> convention assembled, reaffirm our faith In
Democratic principles as thouf principles wÂ«re
sot forth in the last national jilntform of the
party, adorted at Kansas City In 1O0O.
nomocracy means the rule of the peopleâ a
ip.overnnient rtstlnit upon th^e consent of the
governed and administered according to the
will and In the Interest of the people.
With an, Increasing love for the principles
of Deinocracv and an increasing confidence In
their final triumph, we look uoon the pre&ent
time as ouuortune for their earnest and cour
ageous promulgation. With a chief executive
who haÂ» disresarded constitutional limitations,
stirred up antagonism between the races, em
ployed all the power* of his offloe to secure
a renomltiation and ourchasid political sup
port by turning the Treasury Department over
to the .financiers and putting the law depart
ment Into- live hands of the trust* â with such
a. chief executive- and with Republican lead
ers oi>Â»nly an.J arrogantly in alliance with or
ganized wealth. the country Imperatively
n<-*ds a. return of the Government to positive
and' clearly .' defined r>cmocratlc principles.
Democracy aÂ» tauKht by Jefferson and exem
plified by Jackson Is the . hope of the repub
lic and oilers the only relief from the plu
tocracy- wUc)i now dominates the Republican
party, anl, through that party, the country.
Democracy would oppose as inimical to thÂ«*
welfare of the people all private monopolies
arid would exterminate them by the enforce
ment of the- remedies suggested in the Kansas
City platform. The failure of the present ad
ministration to enforce exiMlnjt laws or to
tursrest more effective laws is conclusive proof
that It lacks' the d;siiv. the Intelligence or the
moral couras* to attack the conscienceless
combinations of capital that have flourished
during recent years.
DKYAX'S PLATFORM.
There was no opposition to- the
adoption of the platform as read, al
though one delegate attempted to se
cure the adoption of an adltional
plank pledging the jNebraska De
mocracy to the support of the nomi
ne eÂ£ of the St. Louis convention, re
gardless of whom they might be. He
was ruled out of order after reading
his resolution.
OMAHA, June 1. â The Democratic
State Convention to-day unanimously
selected W. J. Bryan to head the'Ne
braska delegation to the national con
vention ' at St. Louis and adopted a
platform which reaffirms the Kansas
City platform of 1900 and places be
fore the public Bryan's views of what
should be embodied in the platform
of the coming national convention.,
Bryan was himself chairman of the
committee on resolutions and wrote
the platform. He had associated with
him Inen who have been his most loyal
supporters.
the St. Louis convention aid and work
with those Democrats who supported
the Democratic platform and candl

In the adoption of the platform and

Is Arrested on a Warrant
Reuben A. Wolf, ah ex-sergeant of

force for "grafting" from saloon-keep
ers on his beat, was arrested yesterday
by Detective Bailey for. making a cow
ardly and unprovoked, attack upon
Edmond D. Coblentz, an Examiner re
.porter, on Tuesday night. The charge
against him Is assault with intent to
do grievous bodily injury.. Coblentz is
about half his weight and size and
wears glasses, as he is near-sighted. :
Wolf had been expecting to be ar
rested and was prepared with two
bondsmen. Bailey took him and his
sureties to Police Judge Cabaniss, in
whose court Coblentz had sworn to the
warrant, but the Judge was not satis
fied with the qualification of one. of
them and refused to accept him. The
bonds had been fixed at $500 or $300
cash. â* .":
Bailey apparently .hesitated to take
Wolf to the City Prison arid asked tha
Judge what he should do. The Judge
replied that he had enough to do to
look after his own business, and ad
vised Bailey to consult his superiors..
Bailey took Wolf to Chief Wittman and
Wolf asked the privilege of obtaining
another surety. The chief instructed
Bailey to'accompany Wolf to Pine and
Kearny streets and if the, surety could
not be procured to lock Wolf upJ Later
a friend of the prisoner put ! up $300
cash for his release. V* '. " â¢ â¢
Nothing could have been more un
provoked than Wolfs attack on Cob
lentz. who is but half the disgraced
ex-officer's size. : Coblentz was inter
viewing Wolf on the subject of his
connection with a company doing busi
ness in the Columbian building when
Wolf flew into a rage and declaring
that the newspapers . were hounding
him, drew back his mammoth fist and
without warning struck the reporter a
terrible blow on the nose. Coblentz
wore glasses at the time, but this fact
did not deter the bully. There were a
dozen eyewitnesses and all of them
say that Coblentz gave Wolf no provo
cation for the assault. â¢ * "
The Co-operative Mercantile Com
pany was formed in this city a few
months ago. The principals in the
concern were J. F. Olsen, who ran the
inside workings of. the office, and. R.
A. Wolf, who was the outside rustler.
The company offered, great ' induce
ments to all investors to get rich quick.
The Idea was to pay $1 25 a week until
$80 had been paid into the treasury
and when this was done the investor
was to receive $160. The scheme was
like finding money and it.- is reported
that the police force bit at the bait and
Jumped in right and left. Olsep disap
peared about two weeks ago.-
The office In the Columbian building
is closed and the furniture has been
moved away.
Among the members of the police
force who were Induced by Wolf to en
ter the scheme. are Captains Anderson
and Mooney i.nd Sergeants- Lionel

BRUTAL ATTACK
ON A REPORTER
There was little talk before the Har
bor Commissioners yesterday. The pro
ceedings were entirely preliminary.
In his complaint against L. Scatena
& Co. it was alleged by Pierrettl that
he was unable to buy twenty boxes of
potatoes at $1 55, the price asked for the
goods by.L. Scatena & Co. Pierrettl
and Lercari set up in their complaints
that they are solvent purchasers and
that the request that permits to sell
should be revoked was based on viola
tion of the Woodward law by the firms
that refused to do business with them,
and that this constituted discrimina
tion, which the law was devised to pre
vent.
When the Harbor Commissioners met
but two Commissioners were present,
Messrs. Spear and Klrkpatrick. W. H.
Davis, attorney for the board, was
present. Tne complaints came up early
in the meeting. Attorney Wise had
them, and also had prepared formal
notices to parties against whom they
runi All the parties, so Wise said, had
been notified of the bringing of the
action. He requested that a hearing
might take place as soon as possible.
The board agreed to summon the par
ties in interest to appear for hearing
at 10:30 a. m. next Monday.
May 28 was the date on which, as al
leged, the American Produce Company
and Wolf & Sons refused to sell to Ler
carl' at the price placed on the goods
by themselves. Lercari set up that he
went to the American Produce Com
pany and there was informed that po
tatoes were selling at the rate of $1 65
per box. He put down the price of
twenty boxes and was informed that
he could not buy less than fifty boxes,
because It was so provided by the Pro
duce Dealers' Protective Association.
He also, as set forth in another com
plaint, visited Wolf & Sons, and while
he offered the price that was asked by
that firm for twenty bags of onions, at
51 per bag, he was refused the goods
because the Produce Dealers' Protec
tive Association has decided ,that not
less than twenty-five bags of onions
shall be sold to any purchaser.
ANOTHER CO^fPLAINANT.
The complainants are Charles J. Ler
carl and J. Pierrettl. The first named
brought complaint against the Ameri
can Produce Company and Wolf &
Sons. . The complaint of Pierrettl Is
against L. Scatena & Co.
COVERS TECHNICALITIES.
The expected complaints against
members of the Produce Dealers' Pro
tective Association were filed before the
Board of Harbor Commissioners yes
terday by Attorney Otto Wise. The es
sential Â¦ allegation is that the parties
complained of, although they hold per
mits that were issued by the Harbor
Commissioners by virtue" of which they
are entitled to sell perishable produce
on the State property in this city, have
refused to sell their wares to solvent
purchasers who are not in the combine.
For thla reason Attorney Wise, In be
half of the complainants, asked that
their permits should be taken from
them.

The questions that have arisen will
be discussed at the next meeting of
The Buard of Education.
To offset the opinion members of the
board hope to arrange a contract cf
sale that shall provide for a surrender
ti> the board of all intere5t payments
on such bonds as fhall not be immedi
ately drawn upon. 'Unless some course
ehall be devised to enable the Board to
inove along Its originally planned lines
the State wilt be unable, to make an
Investment in the bonds as the Board
of Examiners had hoped to do. There
is in the State school lands fund $500,
000. which is available por purchase of
school bonds. The State board has
expressed a desire to buy that amount
cf Oakland school bonds.
This p'.an was dsvised that Interest
payments might be saved- pending the
development of plans, for new build-
Inrs. The general Idea had been to
use about T2O0.O00 5n the immediate
purchase of new sites and additions
to old lots for school, buildings and to
eper.d about $300,000 in the erection of
two new school buildings.

â¢ The Board of Education is in a quan
dary over the opinion given by the
Pistrict Attorney, which declares that
the school bemd i?sue of $360,000 must
be sold as a whole and' not in parcels,
as was contemplated by the board.
It had been tnÂ« purpose of the school
directors to sell at once not more than
$500,000 of the iFsue and tu reserve the
remainder until such time as it should
be .considered advisable to. dispose of
them. . ' . .
The' parties will meet to-night and
try to effect some sort of a compro
mise as to the disposition of the
children. Â«
Judge Ogden stated that It had been
with reluctance that he had listened
to the last two days' testimony.
"\Vhile there might be room for
doubt as to the guilt of the wife from
what had been testified to." he said,
"the letters which had paEsed between
the- pair made the proof as positive
as though all of their acts had been
done in the light of day. The very
denials of the wife only go to make
the proof against her more con
clusive."
At the close of a sensational day's
testimony in the Richards divorce
case the end came suddenly this after
noon. Judge Ogden without hesitation
giving the decree of divorce to the
husband. Unless the pair make some
arrangement between themselves the
three children will go to the father.
Damaging testimony of improper
conduct on the part of the wife with
George D. Cotton, who holds a good
position with the. Southern Pacific
Company, was introduced. Attorneys
Walsh and Pulcifer, for the husband,
then stated that while there was more
cumulative evidence they were Trilling
to submit the case and also willing
to stipulate that the other side could
tall Mrs. Richards arid Cotton and
that Â¦ they would make a general
denial. With this understanding the
case was submitted.

" The Claremont Country Club has
become the possessor of on&'of the
most ideal homes /or such an or
ganization in the country. Deeds were
placed on /record to-day by which it
becomes the owner of 134 acres of
land, embracing what is known as the
Rockridse Park tract, the Horatio P.
Liverinore . place ami Thermal Vale,
which is to be .converted into one of
the most beautiful and ' attractive
pleasure grounds to be found any
where in America.
A large portion of the tract is al
ready beautifully laid out with trees
of many years' growth, handsome
shrubbery, vines and arbors. It also
includes the Livermore home, a house
well constructed for the purposes of
the club. It contains thirty-four
rooms and is to be further enlarged
by the erection of an extensive porch
and other additions, at an expense of
$15,000. "
The purchase is the result of nearly
a year and a half's work. For a long
time little or no progress could be
made in the matter. The outlay will
involve the expenditure of $150,000.
There are to be golf links, tennis
courts, croquet grounds, with pro
visions for playing polo, hand ball and
other recreations. The site of " this
home is at the foot of the Contra

Lillian Sefton. the new soprano at
the Tivoli, Is a striking example of the
rise of a talented young American girl.
She was born in Washington, D. C,
and has received a thorough musical
education. Before she was out of her
teens everybody in Washington knew
of the talented little singer, and her
splendid success in concert work led
her to decide upon an operatic career.
Her first engagement was with Hen
ry Savage in the Castle Square Opera
Company. She advanced rapidly under
the management of Colonel Savage, and
then went into the Terrace Garden,
New York, .where she sang many im
portant roles. When Reginald de
Koven finished writing "Red Feather"
for Miss Van Studdeford, Miss Sefton
was chosen as alternate and won the
highest praise from critics. Her voice
is a brilliant high soprano, possessing
great carrying power and strength in
ensemble, and its quality in solo work
is sweet and sympathetic. Sergeant
Kitty should prove an ideal role for
her, and it is prophesied that she will
win the audience from the start.

FROM "a disgusted member of the Stablemen's
Union" The Call has reteived a note in comment
jpon our notice of the assaults and violence inci
dent , to the dispute between stable owners and their
former employes. He^says:
"These cowardly and brutal assaults are the more ag
gravated when it is considered that they are committed
by organized bands, partly hired thugs, authorized and
organized by the union, in secret session and with full
knowledge and consent of the Labor Council. It is to be
regretted that men and' citizens of a free and, civilized
country lower themselves to such beastly doings.- and
that they are encouraged by the city officials of-; our.
community. It is a shame and a disgrace to San Fran
cisco."
This, if true, puts the matter in a very serious light,
and we publish it to the end that steps may be taken to
determine the facts.- As we predicted last week, the lack
of protection to property owners and their employes has
compelled them to resort to self-protection. These as
saults and' attacks are serious enough if they originate
only, in a spirit of riot and revenge cherished by,individ
unK H they arc deliberately and secretly procured hv'

The Champion.
Michele Scagllone, whom the boys of
Harlem call "Flipper Mike," is the
champion bootblack of the world. He
won the title a short. time since in
strenuous competition with Billy, the
champion; Michele Luperto, who
wields a skillful brush In Harlem;
Bridge Street Tony, Luigi Riccitelli,
the artist of Madison Sauare. and
Pasquale dl Napoli, who says he is a
Count fallen upon evil days. .; Â« -'J. â¢
For h!s reward Flipper Mike got a
gold medal and a variety of curses In
three dialects. Incidentally, there was
$12 at stake. Tony Bastone, president
of the Shoe Polishers' Union, got that.
For the furtherance of art'the union
ordered the contest. It was held at
Billy's place, Ninth avenue and Ffty
first street. The preliminaries were in
teresting. Tony Bastone made an ad
dress which sounded like Rienzi's to
the Romans. He alluded to the art
of Mlchaelangelo, Andrea del Sarto,
Fra Lippo Llppl, Raphael and Ben
venuto Cellini.
Bootblacking was \ forgotten while
Flipper Mike and Pete Savine of Tenth
avenue settled a little difference which
came out of a heated argument as to
the superiority of Mlchaelangelo over
Raphael. A cop appeared In the door
way and growled.
""If yea dagoes don't ring off I'll run
in the boonch."
The critics of brush and paste shut
up until the barbarian had moved on
his way. but b<e would 1 have been a
hot cop if he could have heard the
"brutta bestlas," the "canagllas," the
stupidos" and the "accidentes" that
were. tired after him.
Then the artists got down to busf:
ness. Billy, the champion, had a try.
Then the Count, then Luigl, then Har
lem Mike.
Flipper, Mike came 'last,' and there
showed his headwork. All the polish
ing had been done on one pair of shoes,
and when it came the Flipper's turn
his rivals had put a layer of polish on
the : shoes that made It a cinch for
him. . . -
When he received the medal there was
a pretty row. Peopte came running
for blocks â¢ along Nlntlfcavenue. Billy,
the deposed champion, who once shook
hands with Joe Grim, wanted to fight
it out in the back room. The crowd
tailed the challenge with 'glee, - and a
Wine for a Gusher.
A corrcspo-ndent from Chandler, O.
T., sends the following to the Kansas
City Journal:
Miss Ethyl Houston, a local school
ma'am, established a precedent when
she christened the oil well which is
being drilled near the town here. While
there v/ill doubtless be few young wo
men, with the* temerity which she ex
hibited, in climbing the ladder and
breaking a bottle of champagne across
the -bar at the top of' the derrick, no
new oil company In the Territory can
start out, under auspicious circum
stances unless this is done.
Miss Houston is a quiet, unassuming
little woman and had no idea of chris
tening the well when she, followed by
her classes, went to the well. Some
one* suggested that the well be chris
tened before active operations, were
commenced and Miss Houston, in a
spirit of banter, agreed to perform the
ceremony if seme one would get the
wine. This was easily done and, true
to her word. Miss Houston climbed the
75-foot ladder and broke the bottle.
When the board of directors heard
of the act a meeting was called and
Miss Houston was voted a free pass to
the St. Louis exposition and to have
her other expenses paid during her
stay there, as well as coming from
and going to the fair.

Desdemona was dead, and all the

made her way daintily upon the stage.
She paused at the first prostrate body
she came to, and apparently said to
herself. "Ha. how is this?" Then she
looked at the body hard and went up
and sniffed delicately at Its face to see
If she could render any assistance. "
The body opened one eye and emit

cat went on. No first aid to the wound

next body was also suspiciously warm
and smiling. . Â«.t-
It did seem to this theatrical cat as
if grown humans ought to be able to
find something better to do than to He
rigidly on a draughty floor while- a man

wasju3t about to tiibble the "ear of 'this

CAVGHT BY THIS jCAMERA DURING THEIR INSPECTION OF THE ROMAN
' FORUMâ AS reCIUEST OF LOUBErS VISIT. r - \, Â¦Â¦. 'Â¦
WITH the recent terrific battle and the eviction of
the Russians from their heavily fortified posi
tions on Nanshan Hill at Kinchou, and with the
sub'sequent movement on the part of the first Japanese
ann3' under Kuroki to shut "off possible, reinforcements
for Port Arthur, from Kuropatkin's base at Harbin, it
appears that the investment of "the Gibraltar of the
East" is soon to be a matter of actuality. The Japanese
army is already within striking, distance of the fortifica
tions, siege guns and additional troops are supplementing
their forces daily, they have an open and direct commu
nication both with Kuroki's army on the Yalu and with
home ports through>thc medium of their fleet on the sea.
It is conceded even by, critics inimical to the interests. of
Japan that Port Arthur will probably fall within three
month's.
* Already the question is forming in the minds of the
diplomats and the war ministers of the powers: What
will be the effect of the fall of Port Arthur upon Russia,
upon the future operations of that power in the field?
Recent press dispatches from St. Petersburg declare that
the impression prevails there, even among the highest
in the Czar's government, that the fall of Port Arthur
means the ending of the war. French military experts
add the weight of their testimony, to this conclusion.
If Port Arthur falls Japan controls the key to the whole
of Manchuria;-it will not be to her purpose to enter upon
a-.wild chase after the retreating Russians along the
northern line of the railroad.
The Czar's government will probably never admit to
itself that the capture of Port Arthur means the end of
the. war; even if much territory is lost thereby, St. Peters
burg cannot let Russian prestige slip away in defeat
without a desperate effort to recoup. Furthermore,
there are at stake all previous treaties with China where
by Russia has enriched herself enormously^and builded
high promise for the future. Already it is being bruited
about that Japan is contemplating restoring Manchuria
to its rightful owner if she wins it by force of her supe
rior arms. This means that railroad rights, mining rights,
timber rights, all that has been wrung from China by
the long continued application of the screws of a devious
diplomacy, must go.
The query remains: What can Russia do if Port..Ar
thur falls? Already Korea is cleared of the Muscovite.
Count Ito was there, at last reports, seeing to it that
Japan's "friendly influence" was paramount in the realm.
The first army of Japan is successfully clearing the lower
Yalu country of Russian forces; the second army will be
supreme in the Liaotung Peninsula if it encompasses the
fall of Port Arthur. With that accomplished the Japan
ese need feel no necessity of following the Russians
up into the north country and pushing the offense. It
will remain for the Russians themselves to assume the
offensive and bring their desperate rally to bear upon the
brpwn men when and where the latter please. This is an
outlook gray enough for that greatly feared Adam Zad
of half a year* ago, the terrible unknown of the northland.

quandary Is as to whether I had better
eat him before he gets so poor from
eating rice straw and the labels from
soup cans that he isn't fit to eat, or to
hold him and take chances on getting
away some time. I would rather chew
him than some other brands of plug I
know. That's the best Joke I've sprung

Another True Story.
"Did you ever hear of the Galapa
gos Islands, . down In the South Pa
cific?" queried a weather beaten old
"beach comber" as he squinted from
under a pair of bushy eyebrows at the
half dozen loungers gathered on the
sunny side of the dock. Not waiting
for reply, the veteran continued:
"Me and a shipmate was stranded
there once and If it hadn't 'a* been for
one of them monster turtles that in
habits those rock piles I wouldn't 'a*
been here to-day to tell about It. It
was this way. ,
"We was in a little trading brigf and
had run short of water. The 'old man*
got bearihgs on the Galapagos and he
runs in there. Me and my mate was
sent ashore in a small boat with casks
to get fresh water, knowin' there was
plenty on the islands. Fact is, out
side of turtles and. rocks there isn't
anything else there.
"We made fast the boat after .hit
ting the beach and unloaded our
casks. But before we got back to the
beach from the fresh water pools it
corries on to blow a gale. The small
boat went adrift and before our eyes
we see the brig under heads'l and a
Professor - Finney. That record â¢ con
sisted of swimming 113 yards one inch
under water.
The management of the baths Con
sidered it presumptuous on the part of
such a youngster to aspire to any
thing approaching Finney's record,
but seeing he was a stranger they
agreed to allow him to test his abil
ities. He desired that the water should
be regulated at a temperature of 75
degrees. Plunging in ho did 112 yards
5 Inches to the amazement of the at
tendant and other? who came from
other parts of the building to see him.
He beat Finney's record for time at
this distance. It is also worthy of no
tice that while Smultzer had the water
at a temperature of 75 degrees
Finney's,, record was made at 80
degrees, whieh is considered among
.swimmers as a great advantage
to the latter. It is also point
ed out that If the Denver lad had es
sayed the task from the deep instead
of the shallow end of the bath he
would have beaten the world's rec
ord. The fact that this feat has re
ceived no publicity this side ' is ex
plained by the circumstances that the
â¢effort was bo informal and that the
newspapers are by no means friendly
to American athletes. Toung Smult
zer is coming over again in the au-
HIDDEN among the war news from St. Petersburg
is a little news. item that is suggestive. It says
that "Great Britain has collected indemnity: from
Russia for the benefit of British sealers whose ships were*
confiscated or interfered with by Russia while sealing in
the Russian half of Bering Sea. Hardly any who read
it connect it with the great international controversy
the settlement of which furnished the cause of action
which has enabled Great Britain to make this reclamation.
Just now when our fleet has been ordered to Morocco
tp protect 'the captured Greek-American Perdicaris, the
whole subject is invested with interest. When Mr.
Blaine was Secretary of State, in President Harrison's
administration, his attention was called to the seal herd
of Bering Sea. Its landing ground was on the_Pribi!of
Islands, where we had leased the' privilege of taking
seals. The lessees complained that their profits were
abridged by pelagic sealing in the open water. Mr.
Blaine conceived the idea that when we bought Alaska of
Russia we also bought that part of Bering Sea inclosed
by a line from the extremity of the Aleutian archipelago
to the continent, and by the Aleutian Islands and the
continental shore, and that all that water was under our
exclusive jurisdiction, a rqare clausum.
Upon exchange of diplomatic notes with "Russia that
Government joined in this Claim, and Washington and
St. Petersburg agreed that we owned that part of Bering
Sea, and that Russia owned the rest, and that thus the
whole water became a closed sea. subject only to the
municipal law and jurisdiction of the two governments.
In pursuance of this claim, the United States for sev
eral years seized or interfered with all sealing craft in
our half of the sea, and Russia did the same in her half.
Both nations in pursuance of this policy seized, libeled
and sold, or interfered with a large number of American
and British sealing vessels. Great Britain demurred to
this claun of a marc clausum. and claimed that beyond
the three-mile limit Bering Sea was open water, the
same as the rest of the'Pacific Ocean. After many dip
lomatic exchanges Great Britain and- the United States
agreed to arbitrate the matter by an international com
mission to sit in Paris.
The arbitrators heard the able presentation of the case
and decided against the American and Russian claim. of
a closed sea*. This decision was against the claim that
Russia and the United States had municipal jurisdiction
beyond the three-niile limit, and made all spoliations of
sealers on the open water unlawful, to be compensated
by indemnity! Thereupon a judicial arbitration was ar
ranged between the United States and Great .Britain to
determine the indemnity we owed to the British sealers.
The claims amounted to a million and a half of dollars,
and were arbitrated and paid to Great Britain by the
United States.
Then the United States demanded of her partner in
the alleged mare , clausum, Russia, indemnity for the
American sealers who had been despoiled in the Russian
half of Bering Sea. This claim was arbitrated at the
Hague by Dr. Asser, who gave large indemnity to the
Americans; which was promptly paid by Russia. Now
the British claim of like nature against Russia has been
paid, and as an international issue the incident is closed.
Just here appears the matter of final interest. The
United States seized a large number of vessels belonging
to American sealers. The Paris arbitration decided that
such seizure was unlawful. The Americans despoiled by
their own Government numbered three or four times
more than the British and Americans despoiled by Rus
sia and the British despoiled by the United States.
Their losses were so great that the most of them were
ruined outright and have since been in poverty. The
majority of them are San Franciscars. .But up to this
time they have not been paid one penny for the unlawful
seizure of their property by their own Government. It
has enforced their rights against Russia, and it 'has paid
the British dealers seized under the same circumstances,
and Russia has paid for seizing the British ships, but
these Americans, whose "rights l..cir Government en
forces againsf another nation, have asked it in vain for
the same justice from itself that it compels others r to
render.
The. case is very interesting and may well become the
subject of study for those who desire to learn the conr
stitution and functions of our Government. When i%
protects our citizens abroad only one branc.li, the executive,
acts, and acts efficiently always. But when our Govern
ment owes such indemnity to its own citizens injured by,
its own* unlawful act, the executive becomes powerless.
The President can secure justice, for American citizens
abroad, but not at home. Here-they must appeal to the
other two co-ordinate branches, the legislative^ and the
judicial, where too often, as in this case, their cry for
justice falls upon deaf cars.
In the relief of the American-for-convcniencc, Perdi
caris, we may spend twice as much as would compensate
these genuine Americans for their losses, and they, to
the extent of their tax-paying power, will have to con
tribute lo the relief of the Greek in Morocco, but they"
are powerless to get, the justice that is due from their
own Government. Â¦ ' Â¦.

ed by Ach as to jurors who had 1 been
on the regular list prior to January of

Judge in each case made an explana

said, had been summoned by the Sher

of the county to supplement the regu
lar list in accordance witn the code. ,

it the Judge said he had some business
to look after during the afternoon and
he would continue the further argu

appear in court at 10 o'clock this morn

The roll at talesmen was about to

manner of drawing the trial jurors In

defiant and impudent demeanor in
court did "not serve to help his case.
The complainant, who is a cripple,
testified that she was seated on the
grass when the defendant insisted up
on talking to her, and went so far
as to grasp her shoulder and restrain
her when she attempted to leave him.
Her testimony was corroborated by a
disinterested witness, a young man
from the country, who went to her aid
when she called for assistance. The
defendant's gray-haired father and
'mother were in court and the old man
wept when his son was pronounced

"If. it were not for the sake of your
respected parents, with whom I deep

for a new trial was denied, but an ap
peal to the quperlor Court was taken
and the defendant released on $500
bonds. |
"The evidence which led me to con
clude this defendant guilty," said the
Judge, "showed an offense which was
at once cowardly and brutal in the
extreme â cowardly, because it was
shown here that the complaining wit
ness while upon a public street, mov
ing along quietly In the exercise of his
constitutional right to do so, was set
upon by two men, one of whom was
this defendant, who struck him from
behind, felling him to the ground, and
that after having fallen to the side
walk he was kicked by the defendant.
That presents a grave case, and being
a grave case deserves severe punish*
ment. The defendant deserves to be
punished by reason of his wrongful
conduct, and it is to be hoped that the
punishment which I impose in this case
will have a tendency to deter others
from committing like offenses; It must
be distinctly understood that wherever
it is established by the evidence that a
man who is himself blameless in the
eye of the law, and particularly where
the assault in addition to being merely
an assault upon another man's person
Is In the nature of an asault upon the
constitutional rights of every citizen,
those offenses when proved by the evi
dence must be punished, and will be
adequately punished by me."
Egan Is now under bonds of $3000 to
answer for another battery case, which
was heard in Judge Mogan's court.
Both cases were prosecuted by the Citi

It is likely that the charge of grand

to allow another son of rest to perch
upon the bench that William was ar
rested and charged with vagrancy.
"I'll give you twenty-four hours,
Mr. Hughes," said his Honor Mogan,
"and the chances are that you'll get
a cell all to yourself. The jailers alp
stairs are more considerate of a gen
'tleman's desire for seclusion than the
policemen across the street appear to
be."
The Insanity Commissioners will in
vestigate the mental condition of Er
nest Dewey, who has been annoying
the night staff at the City and Coun
ty Hospital by appearing at unseason
able hours and demanding treatment
for imagined ills. If he is pronounced
sane he will be tried before Judge Mo
gan for disturbing the peace.
For drunkenness and disturbing the
peace Mary Fahey was sentenced to
six months' imprisonment by Judge
Mogan. She disturbed the service
last Sunday in St. Patrick's Church
and the united strength of three po
licemen was required to remove her,
so desperately did she resist arrest.
Israel Btrg, who was followed all the
way from England by the woman
whom he, had honored as his wife, and
two children which she swears are his,
was found guilty of falling to provide
for ' the little ones, and Judge Fritz
will sentence him to-day. When the
woman arrived here she found Berg at
the head of another household, and it
was one of her sympathizing friends,
Mrs. May Goldberg, who had him
taken into custody. The woman and
her children are kept from starvation
by the charity of philanthropists who
have heard her story, and an Â«ffort
is afoot to have her returned to her
parents, who are well-to-do folk near
Manchester, England.

"I know that his temper ain't of the
sweetest," said Mrs. Thomwell, "but
I'm ready to make allowance for the
fact that his teeth trouble him. Time
and time again I've advised him to get
'em filled, but he wouldn't do it. And
now see what it has brought him to."
Mr. Thomwell promised to take his
punishment from a dentist and Judge
Mogan let him go.

Mrs. Jacob Thomwell wore a brand
new white waist "when she appeared
before Judge Mogan and stated that
since having her husband arrested for
battery she had undergone a change
ol.mlnd and would like to see? him re
leased.
Mrs. Hicks, who dwells at 368 Geary
street, saw John Foley, teamster, force
a horse to "back up" until %he animal
fell down, and when she reproved the
teamster he told her to attend to her
own business. She had him arrested
and Judge Fritz fined him $10.
â¢ â¢ â¢
out her heart, that the jilted youth
was arrested by Patrolman D. Murphy
and charged with disturbance of the
peace and .vagrancy. The offense was
committed at 230. Mason street, where
Rose resides, and ere he was captured
the "Kid" had thoughtfully separated
himself from the pistol and knife with,
which he had menaced the life of Rose.
Judge Mogan will hear more about the
case to-day.

â¢ Jack Munroe did no work In the
gymnapiutn yesterday and the big
crowd that went out to the beach to
watch the husky miner go through his
stunts was sadly disappointed. Jack
injured himself slightly under the left
arm on Monday and as the wound was
progressing favorable yesterday he did
not wish to take any chances In open-
Ing It again.
The Injury Is a slight one and will
not Interfere with the miner's training
in the future.. He will do his regular
work to-day and will endeavor to make
up for the time he-lost yesterday. He
did not neglect his run on the road,

The victory, of Leopold de Roths

scene wrten M. de- Rothschild led in
his horse, was remarkable. -King Ed

the first to congratulate his old friend,
while' cheers resounded all over the
course. " . ' â¢

ARE HELD PRISONERS
to Withhold Results From
the Poolrooms.
CHICAGO, June 1.â In their efforts
to withhold race results from the pool
rooms, officers of the Hawthorne race
track held their patrons prisoners
within locked gates to-day. Soon af
ter the crowd assembled it was an
nounced that egress would be refused
to the spectators until after the fifth
race. Threats of damage suits did not
move the special policemen and con
stables, who barred all means of exit.
Although every effort was made to
cut off the poolrooms, canvas screens
even being placed along the jockey
board to prevent a free view of the
names of the riders, the agents of the
poolrooms succeeded in getting the
information. From a telegraph pole
on the east side of the grounds a look
out, armed with a powerful fleldglass,
telegraphed the results to the pool
rooms.

the Woods, but Escapes
Death.
CANBT, Or., June 1.â His faithful

from attack by a vicious hog yesterday.
Ziegler\was out in the woods gathering
cascara bark, when without warning
the hog rushed upon him. He was
hurled to the ground and, unable to
save himself, was gashed and bitten in
a horrible manner.
The bulldog was some distance away
when the. hog made its attack, but
valiantly ran to the rescue of his mas
ter. Hog and bulldog fought a fierce,
duel while Zlegler lay on the ground
bleeding In a dozen places. Finally the
dog drove away the hog, which was
afterward killed by Ziesler.

The .trainers and champion's admir
ers passed the afternoon hours in hot
air sessions. It seems to be a conced
ed fact up here that the contest will be
a short one. so the betting was fixed
at $100 to ?S5. This, of course, brought
the discussion down, to the number of
rounds it would last. As is generally
known. Proprietor Jim Hayes of Har
bin Springs is an ardent admirer of the
champion and when compared with the
latter Jim considers Spartacus of old
only a preliminary fighter. Hayes,
who drove a stage and six over St.
Helena Mountain when it was an ac
tive volcano, says he has not missed
calling a championship fight in ten
yoars and will soak the family plate to
wager that Jeffries cleans up Inside of
four rounds. Perhaps that isn't show
ing a quarter at a 'two-minute clip.
Fresh pipes were then served and a
recess was taken to compare notes.
In the evening Mr. and Mrs. Jeffries
and a big bus load of guests attended
a tent show at Middletown. The date
of the big contest is net far off and it
Is the intention of the champion to
break camp on the 14th inst. to take up
quarters at Oakland. '
F. E. MULHOLLAND.
After luncheon Jeff took a rifle and
wandered off in the jungles in search
of woodpeckers, wild canaries, hum
ming birds, hippopotami and "gators."
Then again the big fellow himself
did not seem to be bubbling over with
ambition, and worked but mildly in
the gymnasium after the breakfast
hour. He tugged with the pulley
weights, skipped the rope and then
hammered the punching bag untif the
leather spheroid collapsed under the
continuous bombardment. After this
came an abbreviated spell of shadow
boxing with light dumb bells, followed
by a game of handball.
It was the last Â¦ day In camp of
Officer Pat Foley, one of San Fran
cisco's finest, and he had blood In his
eyes. On Sunday last the champion
defeated Pat and Jack Jeffries at
handball two straight, the latter duo
playing as partners. This morning Pat
and Jack played with the skill of an
Eagan or a Fitzgerald, rubbing It Into
the boilermaker two straight games
21-13 â 21-9. Jeff, however, made
ample apologies for his inaccurate
serving and general lack of clever
play by claiming he could not get his
left arm limbered up. The drubbing
was so decisive, however, that Dick
Adams, the court jester, was speech
less and stupefied for nearly a minute,
when Secretary and Scorer Joe Eagan
announced the results. A run down
the Middletown road terminated Jeff's
work.
HARBIN SPRINGS. June 1.â This
could be styled an off day In
the Jeffries camp, for everything ap
peared to go at sixes and sevens. Joe
Kennedy is nursing his injured wrist
and went about with it so lavishly
frescoed with iodine that it looked like
the yellow peril. The wrist was hurt
while Joe was in the East many weeks
ago, and was never given an oppor
tunity to mend. His recent work
made it worse. Jack Jeffries, who has
marked respect for his brother's
punches, did not care about going it
alonei so boxing was crossed off the
menu to.-day.

CHICAGO, June 1.â The card pre
sented at 'Hawthorne to-day was an
unusually good' one; The feature
event was a purse affair at a mile and
a quarter, - for which Bad News was
favorite. The winner turned uo In
Colonial Girl,. which was given an ex
"cellent ride by Pollak. When. called
on in the stretch she responded game
ly, and crossed the winning line easily.
In the. second; race T. G. Ferguson's
Derby .colt, Bearcatcher, was easily
the best and won handily. Bearcatcher
was one of the .great three-year-olds
in California â¢ last winter. His race
to-day was his third victory. There
was a. flash of eight to five against
Bearcatcher in the opening betting^
but Â¦ the large amount of money : sent
Into the rlnsr forced the bookmakers
to cut his price to nine to ten by 'post
time. He is a bad actor, but got away
all right 'and went to the front and
stayed there. He won easily, by a
length from Soufrlere, a sixty to one
shot, 'which came with a rush in the
last furlong. New Mown Hay was
third, a half length back.
Johnny Dugan, a brother of jockeys
W. and -â¢ Clint Dugan, was seriously

NEW YORK, June 1.â Gravesend vis
itors were confronted with a heavy
track to-day and mud horses were in
great demand. There were only three
starters In the Carlton stakesâMontres
son, Ormonde's Right and Orthodox.
At the start Ormonde's Right was
rather slow . to move and was outrun
to the first turn. Montresson going to
the front. As Ormonde's Right wu
directly behind'hlm the Paget colt was
forced to run with more' or less slush
being thrown in his face. With Ortho
dox on his right hand side, Ormonde's
Right was in a pocket, and Lyne made
! a determined effort to rush. him up be
tween the rail and Montresson. Red
fern, however, let out a wrap and Or
monde's Right was cut off. At six
furlongs Orthodox was beaten, and then
Ormonde's Right was again sent on
after Montresson. At seven furlongs
R. T. Wilson Jr.'s colt was nearest the
rail and seemed running handily, but
soon thereafter Redfern shook him up.
I Then Lyne used the whip on his mount
and with both jockeys vigorously rid
ing their mounts Montresson won by a
length and a half, with Orthodox a poor
third, as his excessive knee action over
such a track presaged. The time,
1:43 1-5, was good on a heavy track.

Captain M. D. Garcia or the Argen
tine navy and Colonel V. del Solar of
the Chilean army, who have been de
tailed to represent their Governments
with the Japanese forces, sailed on
the Doric.
The passengers included the follow
ing named: .
Lee Chuck, the insane Chinese mur
derer, who was brought here from
Agnews to be deported, did not .sail
yesterday on the liner Doric and will
mere than likely have to be returned
to the asylum, where he has been de
tained since 1SS>2. Lee Chuck, who was
once a member of the notorious "'Little
Pete's" bodyguard, was pardoned by
Governor Pardee on condition that he
be deported. Neither Chinese nor Jap
anese authorities, however, will allow
an Insane person to be landed at any
of their ports, and knowing this, aware
that if they brought him back to San
Francisco the authorities here would
not receive him, and not anxious- to
provide permanent quarters on the
Doric for the demented Celestial, the
steamship company refused to receive
Lee Chuck as a passenger. As matters
stand there is no way of getting Lee
Chuck back to China until he dies, and
as no other country will take him the
Governor's pardon will avail nothing
and Lee Chuck will continue to be a
burden upon the commonwealth.
The Doric sailed yesterday with a
full cargo, 45 cabin passengers and 120
Chinese, of whom 75 were deported.
This is the largest number of deporta
tions made on one steamer for many
months.

has Just reached this city of a terrific
flood -which swept down the valley of
Horse Creek. 30 miles north of Chey
enne, yesterday afternoon. The flood
followed a tremendous fall of rain
about the headwaters of the creek and
within a short time the creek was j
transformed into a torrent from 200 I
yards to half a mile in width. It is
said that the damage to ranch prop- j
erty will be immense. There is no re- j
port of loss of life. i

Imitator. His work Is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire 10 know and works in the open
light.

preKion and vivid truthfulness.

you when you call on him for a first-clasa
dilrvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the 1HÂ» and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF.

troubling you. find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

NEW TORK. June 1.â There was a slightly
I wider m rrmrnt of prices in to-day's stock
market il.nn the recent average, but this was
largely ennfined to ppe<*lal otoclts of the dormant
class. The usual market leaders were sluggish
and neglected and their narrow fluctuations
cannot be accepted as Indicative of any widely
held opinions on the market. Many of the
low-priced stock* which sold off sharply to
day have had the appearance of' speculative
â¢affinities In the past under pool manipulation,
and the *ucÂ£e*tlons put afloat In the course
i of this iÂ«*t manipulation have implied a pos-
I f Utility of some ultimate combination between
a number of such roads, small in themtelves
I and of small financial Importance, with no
I dividend dlrtributlon on their Â» tocks and with
more or leg* myptery maintained regarding tho
actual earnings and operation. The common
Interest In theae stocks of a pneculatlve party
of gome prominence has constituted a vantage
point for speculative operations In the group
under leadership. The selling of these stocks
for the last few days Is attributed by the
seller* to fear* that the holdlnjr* of the rpecu
latlve party have been largely reduced and
supporting measures for the securities In the
I market abandoned. The downward cour*e of
railroad earning* delays the hope of dividends,
j which were- distinctively prospective at best.
Â¦ A number of Southwestern raHrnad stocks suf
fered from -professional uneaslneos over their
financial prospects. One or two point louses
resulted In the Colorado and Southern stocks,
the Toledo. .St. Louis and Western*, the St.
Louis -Southwestern utocks. Missouri. Kansas
and Texas preferred and some others. The
heavlncs* elfewhere In the market was largely
In sympathy with that In these special stocks.
News was taken little account of. Reports
of further depression of the Iron output In
prospect helped to depre** United Suites Steel
preferred and wore an Influence on the general
market. So were reports of additional rail
road retrenchments and Â»ome reflected effect
from this on railroad equipment companies..
Continued large demand for anthracite made
the coalers relatively flrm and there was be
sides *ome demand from short* to cover In the
â¢ Eriet on their recent drop. A number of re
port* of net earnings of railroad* for April
showed the declining tendency still in force.
The money market showed no change from Its
recent almost nominal character. There were
some recoveries by the weak * tocks and the
last prlc-s In the general list were little
chanced from last night.

with a total for the week ending yesterday ef
24<ii.i tons;. this Is 200 tons more than the report
shows for last week; in all this quantity not a
single bale of new Hay can t* reported. It
has become generally known that the market is
not quite ready for the new crop as yet and
the farmers are holding back for a more ad
vantageous-seasori. The situation Is not at
all satisfactory, for trade continues very dull,
and It Is generally believed that our regular
summer rush will be somewhat late this sea
eon. Old. Hay has declined to what Is now a
very reasonable range, and, as every one Is
well utocked up. there seems to be no particu
lar need of the new Hay.
"Crop reports are somewhat conflicting, but
as a general statement we can say that to tho
south of us the crop Is lighter than last year,
especially In the extreme southern portion of
the State; In the territory to the east of San
Francisco a very fair yield is reported, while
In the northern districts, throughout Solano.
Yolo. Napa and Sonoma counties, the yield iÂ»
much heavier than last season. Taken as a
whole. It would seem that In the country con
tributary to San Francisco the crop will be
somewhat heavier than last year.
"To summarize, we would say as being our
idea of the situation that this summer's de
mand will not be as heavy as that noted last
year and. although we anticipate no extremely
low prices, yet we believe the market will
range considerably below the figures noted
throughout last harvest season.
"Gilt-edged wheat Hay is somewhat scarce
on our market and meets with ready sale;
other Kradcs an? In plentiful supply and work
off rather slowly."

CHICAGO, June 1.â From the start wheat
exhibited strength. At the opening the strength
was due chiefly to reports of additional rains
In Kansas and other sections of the Southwest,
the fear being quite general that the growing
crop Is receiving too much moisture. Initial
sales on July were %c lower to %c higher at
83lÂ«c to 85%c. An official forecast of more
rairt In the Southwest intensified the general
desire to buy wheat. As a result the market
received excellent support. Decided strength
In corn was a further aid In creating the
urgent demand that characterized trading.
News from the Northwest was bullish, ad
vices from Minneapolis stating that the flour
situation was greatly improved. The claim
was made that mills there are In better shape
now than they have been in a long time,
owing, partly, to concessions In freight rates
granted by the railroads, thus facilitating ship
ments to the EaÂ«. The demand for flour was
also reported more active. During the latter
part of the session a decreaso of 2.50O.O0O bush
els in the world's visible a* shown Ty Brad
etreet's Imparted fresh zest, to the buying
movement. Shorts covered freely and there
was a good demand from Southwestern houses.
The market closed with prices almost at the
top notch. After selling up to 87%c July
closed 1%Â®1%c up at 87#S7%c.
Roports of poor germination of the newly
planted crop in addition to an extremely bull
ish Government crop report caused a bread
corn market. This market! closed at the high
point of the day, July l%c higher at 49%c.
Oats were strong In sympathy with other
grains. July closed at 39%639%c, a gain
of %c. ' '
Provisions were weak, owing to selling by
those who desired to UkÂ» profits resulting from
yesterday's advance. These offerings met with
an Indifferent demand. Increased 'receipts of
hogs generally restricting the desire to buy. At
the close July pork was down 15@17%c, lard
and ribs each off 7%c.

Berries and deciduous fruits continued to
arrive freely and prices of the leading varieties
were well maintained under a steady demand
for local consumption and a fair Inquiry for
shipping. The quotations for Longworth Straw,
benlei represent the prices obtained for choice
offerings. A small portion of the receipts con
tinued to show the effects of the recent hot
weather in the Interior, being more or less
sunburnt, and such stock was cleaned up at
$3ff4 per chest. Surplus lcta of the Mallnda
variety were bought at the minimum quota

market for Gooseberries at the Inside rate.
Blackberries, Raspberries and Loganberries
were offering freely and the latter were very
dull. Currants were easier and new Green
Apples met with very slow sale.
The market was heavily supplied with Cher

prices of packed stock were easier, and as
usual there was a heavy surplus unsold at th*

been any available. Loose stock was held

Everything is running quietly In the same
groove as for a week past and prices show no
marked variation. Most dealers report that
the quality of ranch Kggs Is falling off. and
some are disposed to aÂ»k a cent more for the
finrst, while most of the large handlers are
selling right along at previous quotations. The
present prices please the retailers, for they
enable them to sell at 22HÂ®23c per dozen and
thus dispose of large quantities: but they say
that any advance would cut off this very good
demand. The Egg market, however, is un
questionably In very good condition and Is
shewing signs of cleaning up better, though
some houses are still storing their surplus re
ceipts. Kastern are offering freely and are
competing with the store ! goods, which are
weak In consequence. Quotations for both
ranch and store will probably change very
shortly.

Inspector Jordan reported that the
high fences at the corner of California
and Flllmore streets had not been re
moved and it was agreed to make a
test case of a twenty-foot fence at Mc-
Allister and Larkln streets, which is
.prohibited by ordinance.
Mrs. E. Dunstan complained that a
house was obstructing the; street in
front of her store at 323 Hyde and
asked that it be removed. As the
question of moving houses across
street car tracks is being tested In
court the board decided it could take
no action in view of pending injunc
tion proceedings.
The petition of George Collins for
a permit to place four awnings In the
rear of the premises at 1129 Dupont
street was denied. Inspector Fltz
slmon reported that it was against the
law to erect awnings of inflammable
material in the fire limits.
In the even( that the charter should be held
not to prohibit the closing of Ocean avenue
and that the Board of Works considers It
advisable to recommend the acceptance of the
corporation's proposal to deed the land for the
boulevard in exchange for the closing of Ocean
avenue. I would suggest that the question of
the actual route be referred to this office for
a decision by Its engineers. Here would be
an opportunity to construct a boulevard to
conform to the character of the country to be
traversed and not to follow the rectangular
system that has eo marred the natural beauty
of San Francisco.
City Engineer Woodward filed a re
port showing that jthe cost of the one
hundred-foot boulevard proposed by
the Spring Valley Water Company
from Nineteenth avenue to the Great
highway would be approximately $75,
000. The report says:
Thfere are some architects who think they
can get their surveys made cheaper by em
ploying private surveyors and when a mistake
Is made they think it would be unjust for the
city authorities to have them remedy the mis
take. I think an example should be made in
thlp case by ordering thia front removed from
the sidewalk - or as much of Â¦ It aa would be
feasible without injury to the building.
The board ordered the owner of the
building to move it back to the line of
the sidewalk.
City Architect Shea reported to the
Board of Public Works yesterday that
owing to the error of a surveyor named
F. J. Baker the new six-story brick

The rueating apparatus of the lodg

ploded yesterday afternoon and caused
considerable damage to the upper sec

one -was injured, as the house is un
dergoing renovation and the portion
near the scene of the explosion was
not occupied.
The heating apparatus was located
on the top floor and consisted of a
large water vat over a small coal fur
nace. The draught was not sufficient
to carry off the gases of combustion
and the explosion followed. The roof
over the room was blown off and most
of the windows of the upper portion
shattered. The damage will amount
to about $500. -A flre alarm was
sounded, but "no blaze resulted, the

time other thsn that the City Council adopted
th"m In the belief that they are fair to the
company and just to the consumers. The City
Council used Its best endeavors to reach such
a result. I can say that many days and nights
cf arduous effort were exhausted In the work
of preparing this new schedule.
The proper place to reply to this lc In court
and In a leral way. Steps will be taken at
once to Fee that the City Council Is properly
represented in court, and that due resistance
be made to the water company's application.
It :s more thÂ«n likely that a special meeting
of the City Council will be called for Friday
night, that the situation may be canvassed
and a decision as to action be reached.
That the City Council will defend its action
In reducing: the water rate there is no doubt.
Officially I have yet to b; Advized; but. of
course. I know from report that the company
has filed n petition for injunction against the
enforcement of the rates, on the ground that
they are eonflycatory.
The Spring Valley Water Company
and the Contra Costa "Water Company
filed bills of complaint yesterday in the
United States Circuit Court against
the Board of Supervisors of San Fran
cisco and the City Council of Oakland,
respectively, complaining that the
water rates as fixed by those munici
palities are unjust, unreasonable and
oppressive, and asking that the water
ordinances fixing rates for the fiscal
year ending June 30. 1905, be declared
null and void^
Judge Morrow in each case declined
to Issue a restraining order, and set
next Monday at 10 o'clock as the
time for hearing the cases.
The Spring Valley Water Company's
complaint alleges that the rates as
fixed by the ordinance of 1902 have been
cut 7 per cent by the Supervisors; that
the hydrant rate, which should be $5
per month for each hydrant, has been
cut from $2 to $1. and that the ordin
ance does not allow the company suffi
cient by $104,000 on Its taxes. It is com
plained also that the ordinance does not
allow for the taxes on J5.395.233, the as
sessed valuation of the franchise. The
complaint alleges further that the City
Engineer's estimate of the value, of the
plant at $26,173,212 is too small, and that
the actual value exceeds $40,000,000.
Rates which will pay operating ex
penses, taxes, wear and tear and 7 per
cent income on the value of the plant
are asked for.
The Contra Costa Water Company's
complaint asks that the ordinance
passed by the Oakland City Council
last Tuesday be declared void. The
court is asjted to enjoin the City Coun
cil from reducing the general fund of
the city of Oakland for other purposes
than water. It is alleged that the
rates fixed are unreasonable, oppressive
and. confiscatory. The company asks
for a 7 per cent net income.
Service of summonses was begun on
the City Counclimen of Oakland imme
diately after the *order of court was
made and the necessary papers pre
pared. Concerning the action of the
Contra Costa Water Company, George
W. Dornin, president of the City Coun
cil of Oakland, said last night:
The Health Board will also appeal to
the Supervisors to increase its appro
priation, one item of $1000 to improve
the emergency hospitals being consid
ered Imperatively necessary.
During the present fiscal year fifty
five teachers were elected, but It is
claimed that owing to lack of funds
very few;, teachers will be appointed
next year.*.
During the preparation of the report
the members of the board discussed
the advisability of petitioning for the
submission of 3. charter amendment to
a vote; of ,the people providing for
levying a special. tax for the= mainte
nance of "the public schools. While no
definite action was taken, each School
Director expressed himself as strongly
in favor of the proposition.
The Board of Education is of the
opinion that the School. Department
should be placed in the same category
as. the parks and public library In the
making of appropriations. The charter
requires that the Board of Supervisors
shall annually levy a tax of not less
than Hf: nor more than 2% cents on
every 5100 of assessed valuation for the
support of the library and not 'less
than 5 nor more, than 7 cents for the
parks. The. School Directors claim that
a tax of, s"ay, 10 cents should be levied
for the schools In order that the School
Department should not be left to the
mercy of, a hostile Board of Supervls*
ors. This tax would mean an annual
contribution from the city of somn
$465,000 and is not considered high In
view of the fact that the State gives
nearly $1,000,000 to the San Francisco
schools. The Board of is
much wrought over the Including by
the Supervisors in its next appropria
tion of an 'alleged surplus of 5108.000,
which "it claims does not exist, and a
special tax would obviate a recurrence
of. such a condition. It would not be
necessary to go outside the dollar limit
for the purpose, as Is the case for the
parks. ' . Â¦
The Board of Education yesterday
completed Its statement showing what
it considers Is an injustice done by the
Board of Supervisors In 'making an in
adequate appropriation for the school
department in ,the municipal | budget
for the next fiscal year. The statement
will be filed with the Mayor to-day and
will be used as a guide by his Honor
In vetoing' specific items of the budget
should he decide so to do.
