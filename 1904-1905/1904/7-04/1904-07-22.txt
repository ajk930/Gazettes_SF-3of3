WAR'S COST TO JAPAN.
WASHINGTON. July 2Lâ According
to an official financial statement Just
received by the Japanese Legation,
Japan's -war account up to this time
aggregates $360,000,000.
This fact is set forth in the fourth
Financial and Economical Annual of
Japan, issued by the Japanese Depart
ment of Finance. The publication,
printed in English and Including a
large number of colored charts, con
tains a mass of statistical informa
tion touching Japanese resources that
is without parallel in corresponding
publications In this or any other Eu
ropean country. One attractive feature
Is the concise and easily comprehend
ed statement of Japanese foreijrn debts
and a comparative statement of taxes
indicating the financial ability of the
country to respond to the severe de
mands of the war.
One little table headed "Details of re
ceipts and expenditures In connection
with the Russian-Japanese affair '*
places the expenditures on that account
at 576.000,000 yen, a yen being estimated
at about C2% cents American mon-y It
should be stated that this total includes
a reserve fund of 40.000.000 yen for
emergencies.
NO MORE JAPANESE RISKS.
SEATTLE, July 21.â Local marine
insurance agents to-day received ca
ble instructions from' London to ac
cept no risksÂ«on ships or cargoes des
tined for Japan without authority
from London. This la considered a
suspension of the marine insurance
business to the Oriental belligerent
ports. The agents say It is the direct
result of the seizure of the Malacca.
But one American steamshiD is now
on the high seas from Puget Sound
â¢with a cargo for Japan. She Is the
Boston Steamship Company's vessel
Shawmut, which sailed July 16 with
15,000 tons of cargo, including 900.
000 pounds of canned beef from Chi
cago, billed to Kobe. The local agent
of the company declared to-day that
he did not fear the seizure of the ves
sel, as the cargo was consigned to
private Individuals and not to the
Japanese army.
Mrs. Rutter then departed for her
home, followed shortly by Rutter, who
stopped long enough to satisfy the cu
riosity of the crowd as to why the
fight had occurred, but cut his talk
suddenly short as a policeman ap
peared. Jealousy is believed to have
caused the affray.
NEW YORK. July 21.â The friendly
relations existing for ""years between
the family of Thomas N. Rutter, a
broker living at 477 Third street,
Brooklyn, and that of Arthur T.
Raynsford of 4S7 Third street, were
brought to an abrupt termination this
evening, when Rutter saw his wife
talking with Raynsford's brother, Len
Raynsford, a contractor, and proceed
ed to pummel him oji the street before
his wife and a crowd.
Rutter, returning from his business,
left a Seventh-avenue car at Seventh
street. As he alighted he saw his wife
with Raynsford, and, becoming en
raged, walked hurriedly to a peanut
vender's wagon, from which 'he ripped
a piece of wood. Then, rcfnning across
the street, he struck Raynsford on the
head. No words passed between the
three, but after four blows Rutter
dropped the short piece of wood and
went at Raynsford, striking him about
the face and shoulders with his fists.
Raynsford, from all accounts, was
taken by surprise, and it was some
minutes before he determined what to
do. Mrs. Rutter stepped back from the
two men and when Raynsford noted
this he gave Rutter several severe
blows on the face, sending him reeling
to the pavement. The men's straw
hats were knocked into the muddy gut
ter and were recovered by Mrs. Rutter,
who held them until/ the two had
parted. The fight was stopped by sev
eral friends.

special dispatch from Moscow, - the
Russky Listok of that city confirms
the report from Liaoyang that the Jap
anese have broken through the Russian
left flank and are marching on Muk

LONDON, July 22.â A Russian cor
respondent of the Daily Telegraph at
Mukden, under date of July 19, says:
"A fierce fight has been raging dur
ing the past two .days and continues.
The Japanese, who are superior in
strength, attacked with great daring
and coolness. The Russians are con
testing the ground splendidly.
"The Japanese flanking movement to
the east is the real cause of our retire

â¢ In a dispatch from Washington sev
eral days ago it was stated that the
American Government viewed with
equanimity the searching of merchant
men in the Red Sea, as the number of
ships of American registry traversing
that water was so small that the men
ace to this country's merchant marine
was Insignificant as compared with the
Interest of old world powers. There
fore this Government did not Intend to
be drawn into any quarrel concerning
the right of belligerent warships to
search neutral vessels for contraband.
As a matter of fact, this right Is con
ceded, and the dispute between Russia
and other/European vessels arises over
a question in' which America has no
concernâ the passage of 'the Darda
nelles by Russian volunteer steamships
and their subsequent conversion into
cruisers. The doubtful character of
these vessels has supplied the basis for
the protest sent by Great Britain to St.
Petersburg.
LONDON, July 21. â Tnere is reason
to believe that Great Britain Is ex
changing views with other powers re
garding the operations of the volun
teer fleet steamships and the hardships
thereby Inflicted on neutral commerce.
The State Department in Washington
particularly has kept informed of de
velopments. It is said in a responsible
quarter that the State Department is
giving especial attention to the legal
aspect of the question of the seizure of
contraband and it is believed Secre

feller is now a director of only the

connected. In doing this Rockefeller
has followed out a. plan formed a yea;
â¢ago to withdraw from every other cor\
poration with which he has been coni

pany and to give his attention wholly
to that. Just how much his course has
been suggested by fear of attacks now
being made upon him and others of the
Standard Oil ring by Thomas Lawson
can only be conjectured, but it Is cer
tain that he has now drawn in his lines
until he exercises directive powers in
but one great corporation.
John D. Rockefeller and "William
Rockefeller have both resigned from
the board of the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas Railway Company, their places
having been taken by Joseph Price of
London and F. N. Finney of Milwau

So quietly and so carefully has
Rockefeller carried out his" plans that
no effect of any importance has fol

Standard Oil. He is still a large stock
holder in many large companies.
Notwithstanding the fact that Rock

the directorates of all companies with
which he has been connected, stories

District Court to-day by the Boston
and Montana Company against F.
Augustus Heinze. the Johnstown Min

In the complaint it is stated that
the Colusa, Piccolo and Gambetta
mines lie adjacent to one another,
lormir.g one compact body of mineral
ground, and the properties are worked
as such. At a point In the earth the
three ore bodies unite and form one

three veins and the large vein after
the junction is formed, to all points

FRANCE ACTS FOR PEACE.
ST. PETERSBURG. July 21. â Gen
eral Kuropatkin in a dispatch to the
Emperor, dated July :J0, says there has
been no particular change . in his
sphere of operations.
"Last night," the dispatch says, "our
sharpshooters and Cossacks surprised
a Japanese outpost at thf village of
Khudianza, ten miles southeast of
Ikhauvan. Twenty-one of the Japan
ese were bayoneted. Those who
escaped were fired upon by mistake hy
Japanese who had come io their
assistance."
On. July 11 the Japanese fire from
the sea stopped and Japanese troops
ascended Kinsan Heights, from the
summit of which rapid fire guns were
used against the Russians. During the
evening of the Uth . the Russian bat
teries sent many shells from three po
sitions against the Japanese on these
heights. This fire was very effective.
Later the Russian reserves, accom
panied by bands of music, began a
movement toward Ludsigdao.
During the night of the ..10th sixteen
Japanese torpedo-boats formed for an
attack; they were, however, discovered
by the searchlights and retired under a
heavy fire froni the forts. At a later
hour that same0>tght a single torpedo
boat made for the entrance of the har
bor at full speed, but she also retired
under fire. Two Whitehead torpedoes
which had failed to reach the cruisers
at which they had been discharged by
the Japanese were found the next day
at the entrance to the harbor.
CHEFU, July 21.â Copies of the N T ovi
Krai, a newspaper published at Port
Arthur, including the Issue of July 11,
reached here this afternoon. According
to this paper the Japanese fleet, com
posed of six cruisers, five gunboats and
twenty torpedo-boats, was seen early
in the morning of July 10 to the south
east. At 8 o'clock in the morning part
of the Russian fleet moved to the en
trance of the inner harbor. The Japan
ese torpedo-boats then approached, and
at 10:30 they were fired on by the gun
boat Giliak and the cruiser Diana. The
Japanese vessels retired. At 5 o'clock
in the afternoon several torpedo-boats
again approached Port Arthur. The
cruiser Xovik, with an escort of tor
pedo-boats, advanced and the enemy
retired the second time. '
Admiral Edward Field, retired, speak
ing a,t a public banquet last evening,
said he believed that the Russian Gov
ernment was trying to drag both
France and Great Britain into the war.
"Do not let Russia play her game,"
he said, "but leave the matter to the
diplomatists. The Malacca Incident is
safer in the hands of Mr. Balfour and
Lord Lansdowne than in those of the
naval men."
The Times says If the report that
Russia has ordered the release of the
Malacca should be true, "it would be
hailed with profound satisfaction by
British public opinion, but it is clear
from Premier Balfour's statement that
no confirmation to this effect has yet
been received at the Foreign Office."
The Daily Mail says there is reason
to believe that the British garrisons in
the Mediterranean Sea will be strength
ened by drafts from the United King
dom, while several vessels will be sent
to the vicinity of the Dardanelles and
others to Port Said:
against the illicit inroads of pirates."
The significance of such language by
a paper so much In the confidence of
the Government and which has been
strongly in favor of an Anglo-Russian
entente can scarcely be overestimated.
The Standard also sees little abate
ment in the gravity of the crisis as a
result of the statement from St. Peters
burg that the Malacca will be released.
"Our dignity and self-respect." says
the paper, editorially, "demand that she
be released before she reaches the Bal
tic. The admiral in command of the
Mediterranean squadron has received
his instructions, tils cruisers are being
rapidly directed â¢ to the proper points
and we presume that if the Malacca Is
not voluntarily surrendered she will be
intercepted before she can pass the
Straits of Gibraltar."
Touching the general question of the
Dardanelles, the Novostl says it la a
great hardship for Russia that a con
vention closing the Black Sea exists,
but the fact remain* that there is no
reason why it should not be altered.
It says it would be an excellent time for
Great Britain to display a friendly

unfortunate if her alliance with Japan

cise her rights when at war and adds
that the right of search applies to all
neutrals.
Another cause for great apprehension
is the broader question of Russia's
right to send vessels of her volunteer
fleet through the Dardanelles. A strik
ing evidence that the danger of the
situation has not been mitigated in the
least, so far as British official i.nd pub
lic opinion is entertained, is afforded
by the Daily Telegraph, which -nder a
large heading. "An Acute Affair." de
clares that "relations between Great
Britain and Russia have reached the
state of an acute crisis, but behind the
incident of the Malacca is the far
lurger question of the status of the so
called-volunteer fleet. â¢ â¢
"It has, we believe, been made clear
to the Russian Government that the
transformation -of . merchant ; vessels
passing through . the Dardanelles into
armed cruisers canjiot-.be .recognized
under any pretext whatever as justi
fying .Russia's interference with Brit
ish shipping. It is not impossible that
as. a concession. to Russian dignity the
Government may offer to permit the
Malacca to put . into some neutral
port.r where her- cargo may -be exam
ined and Â¦ the statement verified jthat
whatever munitions she carried were
intended for the use of the British-
China squadron." :
In its editorial article the Daily Tel
egraph' becomes even more alarmistic,
declaring that '.upon response
to Lord Lansdowne "the issues of peace
or, wjar are staked." Continuing, the
Daily- Telegraph .eaya that only in the
event that Russia is preparing to ac
cept.'; the British' conditions on the
larger issuewould the Government, as
a -.'sop to Russian dignity," permit the
Malacca to be taken vto a neutral port:
'."The main question to be settled be
tween the Russian and British Gov
ernments, If we are; to maintain even
technical relations of friendship,"
says. the Telegraph's editorial, "is the
status of the Russian so-called volun
teer, fleet. The point, which has been
made clear to the Czar's Government
; by Lord Lansdowne is that Great Brit
&ing will not permit. a lightning change
from a merchant vessel to an armed
cruiser. In other! words, if these un
chartered libertines of the Russian navy
attempt to stop or search British ves
sels they will be called upon to desist
arid if they refuse to obey the demand
they will be fired upon and sunk. We
further understand i that the Ottoman
Government will take steps to prevent
the passage of the Janus-faced vessels
through the Dardanelles and in the
event of their evasion will notify our
Government of their departure. These
problems are altogether independent of
the war in the Far East. We are act

the ally of Japan, but as the greatest
naval power, protecting the highways

pers. Special dispatches to a some
what similar effect from St. Petersburg
do not allay the alarmist views. of the
leading organs, which construe Pre
mier -Balfour's post-midnight an
nouncement that the Governm- - had
received no confirmation of the report
in the case of the Malacca to mean
that the incident remains unsettled.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 21.â The
scare yesterday over the Malacca inci
dent has given way to a calmer and
more rational view. The feeling is
held in official circles here, where an
exact knowledge of the, attitude of the
Government exists, that the case will
be speedily and satisfactorily adjusted.
The main difficulty is the excited state
of public feeling in the two countries;
but the Russian Government, under the
directions of the Emperor, who is per
sonally anxious to avoid grounds for a
quarrel, is apparently ready to meet
Great Britain in the most friendly
spirit.
To the Emperor primarily, but also
in "a large degree to Foreign Minister
Lamsdorif, is due the credit for re
straining the Chauvinistic spirit of a
certain element which talks lightly of
the possibility of war with Great Brit
ain.
The Russian position can be stated in
a few words. While not admitting that
the Russian captain seized the Malacca
without some warrant, Russia will ac
cept without question Great Britain's
assurance that the war munitions on
board the vessel were Government
stores bound for the naval station at
Hongkong and order the immediate re
lease of the ship. At the same time,
she will maintain her right to stop ves
sels , believed to have contraband of
war on board and detain them if the
manifests are not plain, as required by
international law.
Whether Russia will agree to discuss
the war status of the Red Sea cruisers
is not plain, but if Great Britain in
sists seriously she may offer to refer
this and other collateral questions to
The Hague tribunal.
It Is said that the Foreign Office was
not consulted regarding tho, interna
tional questions involved when the de
cision to send the vessels of the volun
teer fleet and convert them into war
ships was reached, but this cannot be
confirmed. The Emperor's brother-in
law, Grand Duke Mikhalovitch, who is
a strong reactionary and who is said
to have planned the cruise, seems to be
responsible for the present entangle
ment.
Nothing is ascertainable here regard
ing the reported pourparlers of the
powers on the general subject of.neuf
tral commerce, but that these are pass
ing is not considered likely.
The Prlnz Heinrich incident seems
certain of satisfactory adjustment.
There appears to be no desire on the
part of Germany to crowd Russia, that
country being convinced that any
wrong which may have been done will
be righted and that proper reparation
will be made. :.

They- lived there in content until
their little boy passed away. Time was
f lowly mending the broken thread of
their happiness whpn trouble broke out
ngain and they were evicted as stran-
F'-rF. Another fight in the courts is at
hand.
A month away from his young wife
Â¦was all he was willing to stand, how
.er, and at the end of that period he
gathered up his belongings and return
ed to her. Within another month he
again absented himself from his wife,
and it was while she was wondering
end worrying that she was served with
a summons to appear and defend her
f-elf in an action brought by her hus
band's father to annul her marriage.
The case dragged along without the
appearance in court of either party to
the suit until February of 18&8, when
Mrs. Monnier filed her answer. The
case was called for trial and when the
young wife appeared to testify she
carried in her arms a pretty baby girl
two months old. She won her suit and
3-cung Monnier. for a time free from
the exactions of his parents, returned
to his wife. Another child, a boy, was
born to them, but-these two mites could
not stay the efforts of his parents to
part the young, couple.
Finally the young man deserted his
v-ife again and went to dwell with his
parents. His wife was forced to sue
him for maintenance, and after a lively
legal battle she won her suit, the court
awarding her the custody of her two
children and $30 a month for their sup
port. Then young Monnier's parents
yielded. Their son and his wife "and
children were taken into the Monnier
home on Folsom street.
RETURNS TO HIS BIUDE.
The married life of George and Violet
Monnier has been tempestuous, awing
to the interference of the senior Mon
niers. but their affection for each other
has never waned. In March of 1897
they were married. As a maiden, Miss
Henry was the belle of her set and
6oon after young Monnier met her he
proposed marriage.
She hesitated because they were un
der age. Yc-ung Monnier asked, his
father to consent to the marriage. The
father was obdurate, however, and de
manded that the son wait until he had
attained his majority. On the follow
ing day, the 4th of . March, 1897. he ap
peared at the home of Miss Henry
with a marriage license, to procure
v hich he had sworn that he had at
tained his majority. For a few min
utes the yc-ung lovers conferred and
then they left the house together.
Straight to Grace Episcopal Church
they wont and thefe they were united
in marriage by the Rev. Dr. Foute.
Leaving the church they enjoyed a
Eimple wedding breakfast, then re
turned to the home of the bride's par
ents. There they found a welcome and
for a month they lived there, not once
regretting the step they had taken.
Finally, however, young Monnier dis
appeared. At the earnest solicitation
of his parents, it was said, he took up
his residence on a farm near Calis
foga. Â¦ , .-
L&st night the your.g ecruple occupied
apartments in a downtown hotel, but
to-day they will take action to recover
vheir place in the Monnier household.
STORMY MARRIED LJFE.
Another sensation has developed in
the stormy married career of Georse
â¢ Monnier Jr. and his wife, Violet. -Yes
terday - afternoon this young couple,
Â¦Â» ith their little girl, were evicted from
â¢the home of George Monnier Sr., 231$
FolsuTn street, by the elder Mrs. Mon
nier. It was but one more violent
scene added to the many that have,
made young Monnier and his wife un
harpy ever since their wedding. -
After two legal battles they won a
Xoothold in the old Monnier mansion
and then they thought their troubles.
Tvere at an end. Last March they held
the funeral of their second child, a boy,
irom the old Monnier mansion, but
even this failed to soften the hearts
of the elder Monniers. The dislike they
ehowed from the first for the wife of
their son has' increased since that sad
incident. For several weeks the breach
between George Monnier Jr. and his
nvife on one side and his parents on the
other has been widening. Yesterday
it culminated when Mrs. Monnier Sr.,
through her attorney, George D. Col
lins, procured a writ of ejectment and
Â¦with the assistance of a policeman
placed the young people in the street
end removed their belongings to a
varehouse.

Once again the Pacific Ocean has re
ceived in its embrace a modern ship of
war. The South Dakota, sister cruiser
to the California, majestically treaded
the- ways yesterday and floating well
away across the pla^h of spume which
her advent to the bay occasioned
landed high upon a mudbank, with her
keel buried so deeply as to make' her
immune from tides or storm until such
time as the armorers have equipped
her "to open the purple testament of
bleeding war."
As the imposing mass of steel, grace
fully built as a pleasure yacht but con*
veying in her light lines and terrible
strength a portend of the speed of a
greyhound and the ferocity of a bear,
started slowly toward the water a pret
ty girl, gowned in exquisite taste, broke
on the prow a bottle of champagne. She
was Miss Graco Herried, daughter of
the Governor of South Dakota, who
had been honored with the duty of
christening the cruiser.
The visiting gubernatorial party ar
rived early at the Union Iron Works
on the United States transDort tug SIo
cum. Comprising it were Governor
Herried, his wife and daughter; Frank
Crane, clerk of the Supreme Court and
chairman of the State Republican Cen
tral Committee, and his wife; Code
Commissioner J. M. Brown and wife;
Professor E. W. Nash, State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction, and his
wife, and Miss Alda Johnson.
The launching was set for 6:40 p. m.,
and on account of the lateness of the
hour not more than 5000 persons at
tended, and there were few craft in the
bay carrying sightseers. One minute and
a half before the appointed time the
instruments measured high tide and
the key was pressed by Governor Her
ried. As the great shlD started to slide
Miss Herried raised high her berib
boned bottle of wine and crashed it
against the prow. It was broken into
many pieces. Her lips moved, but only
those nearest to her could hear the ut-
tered words, "I christen thee South Da
kota." #
Cheer after cheer followed the fight-
Ing craft to the water, and these were
continued long after she had found her
moorings. This ended the ceremony.
There were no speeches and no audible
prayers, but the prayers of the nation
will follow her future course.
The Invited guests boarded the Slo
cum and were landed at the Mission
street vrharf. Here automobiles met
the visiting gubernatorial party and
whisked its members to their hotel. The
visitors will Ieare for Portland this
morning, thence proceed directly home.
Governor Herded stated that when the
appropriation was passed by Congress
for the bulMing of the South- Dakota
the Legislature of his State, at his sug
gestion, voted $5000 for a silver service,
which has been manufactured and
turned over to the Navy Department
pending the manning of the cruiser
some two years hence.
Henry T. Scott, head of the Union
Iron Work3, said that the launching
was as successful In every wav as any
that has ever taken place from the
yards. He entertained Governor Her
ried and party at an elaborate luncheon
at the St. Francis Hotel previous to
the launching.
Among the invited guests present

The strikers say the packers are en

Consequently wherever a non-union

Special Dispatch to The Call.
"On the terminal site." said Albert G.
Wheeler, president of the Illinois Tun
nel Company, "we shall have a general'
distributing system for the transporta
tion of freight between stores and ware
houses and the steam railroads. Ws
also will have our own power plant. "We
shall spend 51.5W.CC0 Immediately and
Improve the property gradually. A fea
ture of the terminal will be a storaga
warehouse, where goods can be kept
until they are wanted. There are now
thirty-two miles of tunnels under tha
streets of Chicago."
The most important significance aZ
this practical completion of the tun
nel company's equipment will be the
probable ending of street congestion in
the downtown district by heavy team
ing. The tunnel extends under nearly
all the important streets of the loop
district, and connections will be made
with all the large wholesale and retail
houses and business blocks.
It is the intention of the company to
haul all kinds of freight and material
to and from these big establishments,
to carry goods from the stores to out
lying distributing centers and to trans
port all kinds of refuse which collects
in the large business blocks.
CHICAGO. July 2Lâ A site for & gen
eral terminal of the Illinois Tunnel
Company's system of underground elec
tric railroads has been secured by the
company at a cost of J2.5C0.0CO through
the purchase of the property on the
west bank of the Chicago Hirer nortn
of Taylor street, now occupied by thÂ©
Albert Dickinson Company's seed ware
houses and owned by the Chicago Dock
Company. The tunnel company will
proceed Immediately to remodel the
property, and promises to have its lines
in use by November for general trans
portation under the streets of much
traffic now carried on the surface. On
all sides of the purchased tract, which
measures 404 feet north and south and
700 feet east and west, are the ter
minals of trunk lines. The property has
connection with all the railroads and is
adjacent to the tunnel company's largs
conduit under Taylor street, which con
nects the tunnels under the business
district of the South Side with thÂ»
"West Side tunnels.
The men thus summarily removed
from their labors are accused of no
crime, the only accusation being that
they refused to sacrifice their member
ship in the Western Federation of
Miners and take out Mine Owners' As
sociation working cards.
After being tried by the military tri
bunal, if they still refuse to take out
â¢wcrkir.s cards they will probably be
deported from the district.
VICTOR, Colo.. Jirty 21.â The Port

packing establishments of this country,
where nearly 50,000 workmen went out
on strike ten days ago to enforce cer
tain demands of the union, will be
thrown open to the strikers at 7 o'clock

former employes as can be taken care
of Will return to work. A majority of
the butchers will be reinstated to-mor

days before all the strikers will be

shipments begin to arrive in the usual
quantity, however, the idle men will be
put to work and it is believed that by
Saturday night nearly all of the strik
ers will have been taken care of.

Judge Heacock refused to be con
vinced of Howell's innocence and held
him for trial.
: - C. J. Howell, a picturesque fraud,
formerly earning an honest living as
switchman for the Southern Pacific
Company, was held for trial yesterday
by United States Commissioner Hea
cock on a charge of having unlawfully
impersonated an Internal offi
cer. His bonds were fixed at $500.
The evidence was that on June 18
Howell entered a saloon on Mission
street, kept by a buxom lassie, named
Rose McArdle, and demanded $100 as
internal revenue license, representing
himself as a Federal revenue agent.
Miss McArdle demurred and said that
she had already paid her license for the
current term. Howell thereupon de
manded that she pay him $10, and, this
being refused, made her an insulting
proposal. Upon her expressing indig
nation, he placed her under arrest and
took her to. the police station in the
Hall of Justice, where he requested
Officer Ward to place a charge against
the woman of selling liquor without
having paid the special revenue tax.
He represented to the police that he
was a revenue officer, and when asked
to show his badge of authority replied
that he had forgotten it, but would go
and get it. He then started on a run
out of the door and was pursued by
two policemen, who caught him at the
Intersection of Montgomery and Mer
chant streets.
In his defense yesterday he swore
that he had received an accident to his
head several years ago. and that a sil
ver plate had been inserted in the
skull. The effect of the Injury, he said,
was to make him oblivious to all that
happened -when he was drinking; that
he was drunk when he placed the
blushing Rose under arrest, and that
he could not recall a thing that had oc
curred.
Wetter was brought to Grangeville
to-day and declines to make a state

Twelve extra policemen were sworn
in about 6 o'clock, and these, with the
regular uniformed men, are patrolling
the streets to-night with drawn revol
vers, keeping the crowds moving and
preventing congregation at 'any point.
About 10 o'clock a man under the in
fluence of liauor fired a revolver into
the air in .front of a saloon, then
stepped inside. Immediately a great
crowd collected in front of the saloon.
Two policemen forced their way into
the saloon and arrested the man who
fired the shot. When they reached the
street the crowd again attempted a
rescue, but the police succeeded in
jailing their man. Shots were fired in
different parts of the town, creating
intense excitement. .
Later in the evening a gambler was
arrested and safely lodged in Jail. It
is believed that an organized body will
attempt to release him before morning.
At 9 o'clock a crowd attacked an of
ficer, took his night stick from him and
beat him severely about the head. He
was taken in a bleeding condition to a
nearby drug store, where his wounds
were dressed. A few moments later an
officer made an arrest in a saloon and
got his Drisoner to the station, when a
crowd made a rush for him. Cries of
"Take away his star," "Beat him up,"
etc., rent the air as the mob pushed
forward intent upon a rescue. Reaching
the middle of the street the officer
turned, squared off and pointed his
gun at the crowd and slowly dispersed
it, and the officer landed his prisoner
at the station.
The approaching close to the regis
tration period is being illustrated in
the increasing numbers of those who
wish to add their names to the already
long lists.
BONESTEEL, S. D.. July 21.âEx
citement is running high in Bonesteel
to-night, brought about by the rescue
of an arrested gambleV, who was taken
from the hands of the police by a dozen
or fifteen of his friends and rushed
down the main street of the town and
secreted. The gambler was arrested
and was being escorted to the station,
when suddenly, at the word of a leader,
a crowd of cappers and friends of the
prisoner made a dash for the police
man having him in charge. Seizing the
prisoner, they' tore him from the grasp
of the officer,- who' drew his revolver
and struck one of the attacking party
a blow in the face. The attacking par
ty surrounded the prisoner and suc
ceeded in getting him away.
The city authorities immediately be
gan swearing in extra police and have
expressed the determination to enforce
the law at any cost.

CAI.IFOIIMANS'AT THE FAIR.
While other Elks have been enjoying
a series of festivities the members of
the Grand Lodge have been in session
all day and again to-night. The recom
mendation of Grand Exalted Ruler
Fanning abolishing the grip and sign
was adopted, and the committee on
ritual was directed to prepare a new
edition for exemplification at the Buf
falo lodge next July.
The awarding committee, being un
able to decide the contest between
Manila and Los Angeles for the lodge
having the greatest aggregate mileage,
has referred the matter to the commit
tee on arrangements. The Californians
claim that they expended $12-000 In char
tering a special train to brine a laree
attendance here for the prize, while the
sixteen men of the Manila lodge are
Government employes in the Philip-"
pines and have been traveling in the
United States for months. There are so
many questions involved in the contest
that the general committee does not
expect to settle the controversy until
next week. *
The Grand Lodge considered changes
In the ritual. It is settled that there
will be no change from annual or bien
nial reunions at this meeting.
Preceding: races and field sports there
was a mammoth midday barbecue at
Oakley racetrack, where over 20,000
pounds of beef was served and burgoo
was made in several kettles holding 800
gallons each, while other refreshments
were without limit.
CINCINNATI, July 21.â The feature
to-day of the reunion of Elks was the
session of sorrow in memory of Past
Grand Exalted Ruler Meade D. Det
weiler, who was at his death chairman
of the board of governors of the Na
tional Home for Elks, in Richmond.
Va. Among: those who delivered ad
dresses were Past Grand \ Exalted
Rulers Fanning and Rickett. Judges
Fisher of New York and Slelvin of Cal

adopted.

been added to the long list of Truckee
River mysteries. The body of N.

employe of the San Francisco Con

gaged in Government work in Nevada,
was found to-day floating in the
stream. His skull was frightfully
crushed, a rope was tied about his neck
and the pockets in his clothes were
turned inside out. ? Every indication
goes to show that Ahearn was mur
dered and that robbery was the mo
tive.
Ahearn was last seen alive on Tues
day, when he cashed a check for $100.
Not a cent of the money was found
upon the body to-day, and a gold watch
Ahearn was known to carry is also
missing. He was a peaceable man, so
far' as known, but on Tuesday stated
that he was going to quit his position
on account of not being able to get
along with one of the Government in-,
spectors on the work. He did not men
tion the man's name.

OLTMPIA. "Wash., July 21.â Because
of a defect in the papers presented by
Detective F. J. Coleman of the San
Francisco police department. Governor
McBride to-day refused to honor thÂ»
requisition for the return of Ah Oy,
alias Loy Sen, -a Chinese woman -who
is fighting against her return to San
Francisco, where she is wanted on a
charge of embezzling $1000.
Loy Sen, it is claimed, was brought
to the United States in slavery.
Through the agency of a mission la
San Francisco she escaped from the
slave owners and went to Seattle and
later to Walla Walla, Wash., where she
was married to one of her countrymen.
The charge of embezzlement, she
claims, was brought to secure her re
turn to slavery In San Francisco.
The affidavit of Charles Dowell, m.
Seattle lawyer, was presented. Dowell
swore that he was present at the
woman's wedding In Walla Walla, sev
en days after the crime was alleged to
have been committed in San Francisco,

PACIFIC GROVE. July 21.â Captain
Hobson lectured in the Chautauquan
Auditorium this afternoon on "The
American Navy," and made a strong
plea for its strengthening. He said his
highest ambition was to see America
mistress of the seas. He wanted to see
so many gund in our navy that their
great number would make it unneces
sary to use them.
"Give us an adequate navy,"|Said he,
"and no foreign power can ever land
on our 17,000 miles of seacoast, within
gunshot of which 20,000,000 of our'peo
ple have their homes. Russia would
now mortgage her empire for four gen
erations to get twenty battleships, but
she can't get them, while Japan is
happy because she sQent so much
money. on her navy."
Captain Hobson said that there was
an understanding among the military
powers of Europe to dismember and di
vide China among themselves, and he
wanted the Monroe doctrine extended
to China to prevent it. The powers
would take advantage of the present
war to divide China. He predicted that
Port Arthur would fall, as only 20,000
men were left there instead of 120.000.
"The European nations will not de
clare war on Japan," he said, "but will
notify her that she is disturbing the
peace of the world. Then the present
war will stop and the powers will ex
tend their possessions in Chiryi as an
excuse for maintaining peace there.
The moment the partition of China be-

Washington Democrats, part of whom

perfectly loyal to Bryan and his more
radical ideas. At Spokane it is pro

"We have also reached a time when
the Postoffice Department should em
brace a telegraphic system as well as a
mall system. While the telegraph
lines do not reach , as many people as
the railroads do, and while thQ abuses
of private ownership have not been so
open and are not serious, there is no
reason why this nation should not do

LINCOLN, Neb., July 21.â William J.
Bryan's plan for the reformation of
Democracy was published to-day.
Bryan favors radical changes, but ad
vocates the election of Judge Parker
for President as a good beginning. He
declares for state ownership of rail
roads. Government control of tele
graphs, abolishment of private monop
oly, the income tax and the election of
P'ederal Judges by the people. Bryan
says in part:
â¢'The money question Is for the pres
ent in abeyance. The increased produc
tion of gold has lessened the strain
upon the dollar, and while bimetallism
is as sound in the ordinary as it ever
was, the necessity for it is not so ap
parent.
"While I have heretofore refused to
take a position upon the question . of
Government ownership of railroads, re
cent events have convinced me that the
time is now ripe for the presentation of
the question. The plan usually sug
gested is for the purchase of these
roads by the Federal Government. This
plan, it seems to me, is more objection
able than a plan which involves the
ownership and operation of these roads
by the several States. To put the rails*
in the hands of the Federal Govern
ment would mean an enormous cen
tralization of power. It would give to
the Federal Government a largely in
creased influence over the citizen and
the citizen's affairs, and such centrali
zation is not at all necessary. The
States can own and operate railroads
within their borders just as effectively
as it can be done by the Federal Gov
ernment, and if it is done by the States
the objection based upon the fear of
centralization is entirely answered. A
board composed of representatives
from the various States could deal with
inter-State traffic of the various lines.
"While the Democratic party in the
nation is advocating Government own
ership of railroads, the Democratic
party in the cities should, upon the
same theory, espouse the cause of mu
nicipal ownership of municipal fran
chises.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., July 21.â
The Democratic State convention to
day nominated the following ticket:
Governor, Joseph W. Folk, St. Louis;
Lieutenant Governor, Thomas L.
Rubey; Secretary of State, Sam B.
Cook: Auditor, Albert O. Allen; Treas
urer, James G. Cowgill; Attorney Gen
eral, Elliot W. Majors; Railroad and
Warehouse Commissioner, H. Rubey
Ogles by; Presidential Electors, Robert
H. Kern, Moses C. Wetmore.
The Folk idea of fighting against
bribery and the corruption of officials
throughout the State was the elogan
of the convention, and the platform
adopted stands for the stamping out
of bopdling and the prosecution of
oorruptionists and boodlers to the bit
ter end. Folk, in accepting the nom
ination for Governor, said in part:
Grover Cleveland's published article
discussing the present Democratic
policy and Judge Parker's leadership
is regarded by Judge Parker as likely
to be of great value in the campaign
as one of the strongest appeals yet
made to Democratic voters. With re
g-ard to the frequently made statement
that an invitation to visit Rosemount
had been received and ignored by
Charles F. Murphy, leader of Tam
many, It is learned that the report was
based upon a remark made by Bourke
Cochran during his recent call upon
Judge Parker. Cockran Is said to
have suggested such a visit by the
Tammany leader and Judge Parker
said he would be very glad to welcome
Murphy to Rosemount whenever Mur
phy could find it convenient to come.
It is said that W. R. Hearst haa
been Invited to Rosemount, but no
date has been fixed for the call.

been the quietest day sit Rbsemount

only guest was Henry Loomis Nelson

liifiits of Grover Cleveland.
QUlli^ DAY AT ROSEAJOUXT.
Judse Parker Pleased With State-
Henry G. Davis, the Democratic
candidate for Vice President, started
for Bedford Springs, Pa., to-day.
Thomas Taggaft, member of the Demo
cratic National Committee from In
diana, to-day had a conference with
John W. Kern. Mr. Kern is just as de
termined as ever to insist upon Mr.
Taggart, and?is still talking about the
importance of the West in connection
with the campaign.
Tagffart, it is expected, will meet the
members of the national committee as
they arrive here. He says that there
is nothing for him to say now and he
does not intend to discuss the matter.
August Belmont settled all talk about
himself in connection with the national
chairmanship by telling his friends
that he would not be considered for the
place., It is said Belmont favors Tag
gart for the place.
Unless Taggart should voluntarily
withdraw it is not believed Senator
Gorman would allow his name to be
used, and perhaps not even in that con
tingency. At the same time some of
the ..Eastern men still' think that the
Maryland Senator is a possibility and
do not relinquish the hope that he will
manage the campaign.
Most of the Democratic leaders who
have been conferring about the chair
manship have left the city and are not
expected to return until Monday.
Gorman will not take the chairman
ship of the Democratic National Com
mittee, the men who have been urging
him for the place will turn their at
tention to William F. Sheehan and try
to cause his election by the- national
committee. They say either Sheehan
or Gorham is preferred over Taggart,
because either of them vrould be able
to command the attention of Eastern
business men and obtain. a large cam
paign fund. While the Judge's ad
visors say that Taggart will be amply
provided for in an advisory capacity,
they think that either Gorman or
Sheehan, with their wide experience,
would be better able to conduct the
campaign. -

Will Test Divorce I>a\v.
OAKLAND, July 21. â Attorney W.
H. L. Hynes will probably test the di
vorce law in the case of Ida Her
bert, who some time ago got a
final decree against T. J. Herbert,
her husband. Hynes may apply to -the
Hupreme Court for a writ of manda
mus to compel the issuance of a final
decree. If the court holds that Mrs.
Herbert is not entitled to a final de
cree she mujt wait one year before the
legal separation has become a finality
The question involved is whether a
final decree of divorce is valid, though
granted since the new law went into
effect. The law provides that divorced
lersons must wait one year for The
final decree. The present tangle was
caused by the Supreme Court when it
affirmed the validity of the interloc
utory decree law. Judges in this
county and elsewhere had held the
law invalid.

DIES OF HIS INJURIES
The physician hastily wrapped a

Ing the sidewalk, he hastened to a,res
idence opposite and Mrs. Robinson was
put to bed. .Dr. Emerson says the wo
man will recover, and that the opera
tion, notwithstanding the fact that it
was performed under extenuating cir
cumstances, will be a success.
The children started the fire under a
porch. The. damage Is about $500.
In speaking of the experience, Dr.
Emerson, deprecating personal hero-
Ism, said: "I simply used what I be
lieved to be the best Judgment in re
maining with my patient. It was very
fortunate that the operation was near
ing completion when the fire took
Time seemed to pass slowly. The fire
had gained headway and spread to an
adjoining residence, . that of R. Bern
hart, and the atmosphere was stifling.
Help seemed far away, and It appeared
as if no one would ever render assist
ance. Dr. Emerson had Just placed
the last stitch in the wound when a fire
engine drew up in front of ,the house.
Some one had seen the blaze from a
distance and turned In an alarm.
Soon the physician detected the odor
of smoke. Looking thrtmgh a window
he saw that the side of the house was
on fire. He . also observed the two
babies standing near by, gleefully
watching the crackling flames.
When Dr. Emerson discovered the
fire the Incision had been made and
he could not desert his post. His first
Impulse was to give an alarm, but he
realized that delay with his patient
might result fatally and he bravely re
mained at the operating table. The
nurse could not leave the room and,
\\*lth the doctor, displayed courage in
completing her work before the flames
were upon them.
' Had Dr. Emerson attempted to re
move his patient from the burning
building when he discovered the fire
the danger of septic poisoning would
have been great. The wound was open
and there seemed but one course for
him to pursue. Smoke puffed through
the crevices In the walls and the room
became hotter and hotter, almost to
a point . of unbearable temperature.
Meantime the uncbnsclous woman lay
on the table and the physician and
nurse worked with agility.
ACROSS BLAZING BOARDS.
OAKLAND. July 21.â Dr. M. Lewis
Emerson performed an operation yes
terday afternoon under conditions that
seem almost incredible. With flames
raging around him he sought no escape
until his work had been done and an
incision closed; then he carried his un
conscious patient down a burning
stairway to a place of safety.
While Dr. Emerson was operating on
Mrs. B. Robinson at her home, Sixth
and Harrison streets, two email chil
dren.set the premises on fire. To have
deserted his patient would have re
sulted in her death, so the plucky phy
sician completed his work, though the
smoke became so blinding that he
could scarcely see.
Dr. Emerson and Miss Alice Flynn,
a trained nurse, visited the home of
Mrs. Robinson early in the afternoon
for the purpose of performing an ab
dominal operation. The anesthetic was
administered and all went well until
the patient's childrenâ one two and the
other four years of ageâ caused a great
deal of trouble by running in and out
of the. room. Finally Miss Flynn suc
ceeded in keeping the children away,
but not until they had procured a box
of matches that had been placed in a
bureau drawer.

citing and I would rather never face
One of a similar nature again, espe
cially in a case where a life is at
stake. I cannot speak too highly of
Miss Flynn's bravery. She stood to her
post through it all and deserves
credit."
The general appearance of the body
was that of a man who had known the
refinements and luxuries of life.
An autopsy was held late this even
ing at the branch morgue, where Dr.
J. T.. Farrar found that the man had
died from natural causes. An ante
mortem blood clot was found on -the
heart and th.e lungs showed a bad case
of congestion. Either cause. . said Dr.
Farrar, would explain the death.
Hence it is believed that the unknown
man was suddenly overtaken by death
while strolling through the university
grounds.'
The man wore a checkered suit of
clothes, a good pair of shoes bearing
the mark "Sommers & Kaufmann.of
San Francisco," a white turned down
collar and a colored shirt. On the col
lar and the shirt were the laundry
marks "x8060," which is supposed to be
the identification mark of a San Fran
cisco laundry. Around the wrists were
rubber bands.
The dead man was beardless, about
5 feet 8 Inches In height. 160 pounds In
weight and m.ay have been anywhere
between 30 and 35 years old. Some of
the people who saw him to-day thought
they recognized him. as a man who

and Market streets, In San Francisco,
and frequented Aie racetracks.

the date of July 2 and two handker

The first clew to identity was found
in the sweatband of the black derby
hat the man wore. On this was punched
the initials "S. J. S." In the pockets
was a pair of eyeglasses. The case wa3
labeled "California Optical Company."
There were also a razor with the word
"Ellis" upon it, a comb and case, a
pocketknife, 35 cents in money, a call-
BERKELEY, July 21.â The body of a
man, well dressed and bearing marks
of some refinement, was found to-day
lying in the bushes on Strawberry
Creek within the grounds of the Uni
versity of California, above the dairy
connected with the College of Agri
culture. Three days ago the corpse
was first observed by James von
Loben Sels, a university student, who
paid no attention to the prostrate form,
because he thought the man was sleep
ing.' Von Loben Sels passed that way
again at noon to-day, and again he
saw the same still figure. The student
made a closer inspection and saw that
the man was dead.
The Coroner was called and removed
the corpse to the branch Morgue in
this city. Nothing was found to give
a clew to the cause of death.
In the dead man's pocket was a copy
of the poem "Opportunity," by ex-
Senator John J. Ingalls.
There were no signs whatever that
the man died from foul- play. The con
tents of the pockets were undisturbed.
OAKLAND SURGEON' WHO REFUSED TO BE DRIVEN FROM THE SIDE OP A'
PATIENT OX WHOM HE WAS PERFORMING AN OPERATION, ALTHOUGH
FIRE RAGED ALL AROUND HIM.
OAKLAND, July 21. â W. A. Ran
dle of San Francisco sued out a writ
of habeas corpus this afternoon to re
cover possession of his 14-year-old
daughter, Etta, who, he asserts, is be
ing unlawfully detained at Notre
Dame Academy in, Alameda. The writ
is returnable in Judge Ogden's court
Saturday morning.'
Randle says his child was to be al
lowed to visit him and that the Sis
ters have refused to allow her to do
so or to allow him to see her. The
Sister Superior of Notre Dame says
the girl was not placed at the acad
emy by Randle, but by Miss Esther
Hoover, daughter of Professor Hoover
of San Francisco, who was appointed
guardian of the child on the death of
the girl's mother three years ago. The
Sister Superior says Miss Hoover gave
orders that the father was not to be
allowed to see the child.

represent Oakland at the joint confer

ply, to take place Saturday at the City
Hall, San Francisco.
The reouest of F. E. .Chapin for the
return of $8500 paid by J. H. MacDon
ald for street railroad franchises on
College avenue and in East Oakland
was- denied to-night by the Auditing
and Finance Committee of the City
Council. Chapin is a San Jose railway
promoter. He is the assignee of the
MacDonald franchises. The Oakland
Transit Consolidated obtained a trans
fer from MacDonald of the East Oak
land franchise, which covers the Fourth
avenue cut-off, now used by the Key
Koute system. Chapin claims that the
College avenue franchise is defective.
The committee recommended that no
appropriation be made for a hospital
for contagious diseases, that smallpox
patients be transferred to the County
Infirmary, that police power be exerted
to compel such transfer and that the
allowance for quarantine guards at pri
vate residences be stopped.
A partial report from the special bond
committee named $2,492,000 as the final
figure for the bond issue. The election
date was not fixed.

The property is known as the Souther
ranch and is located about three
miles from San Leandro. It consists of
215 acres of rich farming land, upon
which there are many fine horses.
Fruit trees and palm driveways make
it one of the finest places of the kind in
the county. According to Charles H.
Lovell. the manager of the estate, the
attachment is only a legal formality.
He says that he will have the attach
ment released in a day or two, but be
lieves that the claim is illegal and will
make the firm prove its case in court.
The claim Is for handsomely bound
books and fancy etchings purchased by
Mrs. Dunsmuir shortly before her
death. Nearly $20,000 worth of these
claims are outstanding. Lovell says
that the prices charged were exorbi
tant and that Mrs. Dunsmuir, at the
time she ordered the books, was ill and
did not realize what she was doing.
An attachment was placed on the old
Dunsmulr home, near San Leandro,
to-day, the property of Edna Wallace
Hopper, the actress. George Barrie &
Sons of Philadelphia have a claim of
J&66 82 against the estate of Josephine
Dunsmuir, mother of Mrs. Hopper, and
in order to collect it they have had an
attachment issued and placed it in the
hands of the Sheriff.

If it be admitted, as It Is not. that a crime
was committed. It was by some other person
than Jacob Eppinger. I will ask you to con
sider four things: First, did Jacob Eppinger
have any Intent to commit fraud? Second,
was fraud committed? Third, did he knowingly
make any false pretenses? Fourth, was fraud
committed by false pretense? If you have any
doubt on any of these points you must acquit.
The testimony does not show that Jacob Ep
pinger was guilty of any of these faults. On
the contrary. It is shown that Topping wrote
out the note on data furnished by Josua Ep
pinger and that Bernard Ettlinger signed it
and some one else cashed it.

DISMISSES EMBEZZLEMENT CASE. â
Oakland, July 21. â The charge of embezzle
ment aralnst A. W. Berry, a money lender,
who was arrested on complaint of Amos Sea
ton, a local capitalist, was dismissed to-day
by Justice of the Peace James G. Qulnn. The
financial troubles of the parties have been
adjusted out of court.
General MacArthur announced yes
terday that he would attend the regular
annual target practice of the Pacific
Division to be held at Ord Barracks,
beginning on July 28 and continuing
until Aucust 3. Target practice is a
great hobby with the general. He has
always manifested a lively interest In
it and, although he has many duties to
perform in arranging for the big ma
neuvers to take place August 13 at
Camp Atascadero, he will be at the
competition from the beginning to its
close.
At the conclusion of the contest the
general will personally pin upon the
breast of each successful contestant a
badge of honor. Every company In the
division will be represented In this
competition and as the marksmanship
of this division has been of a very hljrh
order during the general practices this
summer, the event will be of more than
passing interest in military circles and
among: those interested in army affairs.

The question Is did Epplnger & Co., on April
14, 19C3, commit the crime charged. We start
with the undented fact that thÂ» bank was
defrauded of $8,S00. In some manner the note
of Eppinger & Co.. accompanied by securities,
found Us way to the International Bank and
from there to the London, Paris and American
Bank. The money was paid out on receipts
for wheat which was supposed to be In tie
warehouse, but which had actually been shipped
away in December of the year previous. Not
a kernel oftha t wheat was In the warehouse
when the note was executed.
The next question Is, by whom was the firm
defrauded? I want to deal only with uncontra
dicted evidence. Can there be any doubt as to
Colonel Beck's testimony? . When he asked
what had become of his wheat he was referred
to 'the firm's lawyer, who, in turn, referred
him to the. books of the warehouse. These, It
has been admitted, were removed at dead of
night and have since been concealed. Why
were they not produced In court? '
The books of Kppinger & Co. which were
produced show balances o! 27,000 tons of grain.
When the bookkeeper was asked where he got
his Information he said It was from report j
regularly laid on the deek of Jacob Eppinger.
You * have learned - from the lips of Jacob's
own clerks that he was the head of the firm
and attended to the business. Tou have also
been Informed that the firm owed $1,250,000 and
had no carh on hand or no grain of any conse
quence.
The Indictment was found on July 17, 1003.
and Bernard Ettlinger left this city in January
of the following year. Is it not strange that
during all those months, if he" is the guilty
party, as charged by x the defense, no attempt
was made to prove it either at the Grand Jury
Investigation or at any other time? It was
not until Jacob was placed on trial that the
blame was laid on Bernard.
For the defense, Attorney Shortridge
BANK WAS DEFRAUDED.
The taking of testimony in 'the case
of Jacob Eppinger, charged with ob
taining money from the International
Banking Corporation by fraud, ended
yesterday morning and at 2 p. m. At
torney J. C. Campbell made the open
ing argument for the defense. By
agreement the time for argument was
set at three hours for each side. Camp
bell occupied one hour; Shortrldge, for
the defense, took up an hour and a
half with a few minutes thrown in for
good measure; Dunne will have anoth
er hour and a half this morning; Dis
trict Attorney Byington two hours and
Ach will not be heard at all. Through
out the trial the most of the question
ing 'has been done by Ach and he has
left the argument to - his associates.
The case will go to the jury some time
this afternoon. ?*- ."-
Attorney Campbell, in his opening
argument, without any attempt at
dramatic oratory, clearly told the jury
on what grounds he expected a con
viction. Shortrldge, for the defense,
was his direct antithesis. "With im
passioned language and many gestures
he pleaded for his client, whom he de
scribed as "penniless, broken in health
and hounded and persecuted by a com
bination of bankers."
Attorney Campbell's opening state
ment in brief was as follows:
Gentleman of the Jury, the criminal laws
of this State are to' protect you as much ao
me and it is your duty in this case to act as
arbiters. We said at the outset we would
brine the facts before you. I believe we have
unraveled the tangle and laid bare one of
the most gigantic frauds ever perpetrated on
the mercantile community.

1. A low rate of fare: The Santa Te
round-trip to Yosemite Valley, flrst
class, costs only $28 50. This saves the
traveler 510 00.
t. No sleeping-car berth required:
The rail journey is made entirely in the
day time and the traveler Is not put to
the expense of a Pullman berth. This
saves $3.00.
3. California Big Trees seen without
side ride: Santa Fe Yosemite stages
pass directly through two groves of
giant sequoias without side ride or extra
expense. This saves 52 Â«0.
4. Good meals at a moderate price:
Meals alon^r the Santa Fe line to Yosem
ite are most toothsome and cost only 50c
and 75c each. These prices are reason
able and save the traveler on the round
trip about 515 00.
5. Modern stasje coaches: Santa Fe
coaches are new-built and especially for
Yosemite service. They are the newest
and most comfortable running into the
Valley. ,v ,-Â¦Â¦-Â¦
6. The Merced Canyon entrance to
Yosemite Valley: Santa Fe stages go up
into Yosemite Valley the way the river
comes down. This Is by far the grand
est entrance to the Valley and passes
cliffs and waterfalls seen. on no other
line.
7. The "Double Loop": By an unique
routing Santa Fe passengers are taken
into the Valley one way and out another,
giving a complete change of scenery for
over fifty miles. This makes the grand

The father and the mother of the
plaintiff separated shortly after their
marriage, the husband leaving his wife
and baby to provide for themselves as
best they could. Poverty and privation
soon caused the death of the mother,
and her\sister took charge of the af
flicted and helpless boy. She has man
aged to have him* partially educated in
a school for the blind and has also
given him some rudiments of a busi
ness education, but the lack of sight
prevents him from earning his support.
He is said to have remarkable musical
talent, which with proper instruction
might be developed into a means of
making a living.
Bacigalupi senior claims that his son
Is amply able to make a livelihood for
himself. He also denies that he Is in
receipt of an income greater than is
necessary for the support of his present
In the Superior Court a complaint
was filed yesterday by Luclen Peter
Bacigalupi against his father, Peter
Bacigalupi, asking for maintenance.
The complainant is 21 years of age. He
is totally blind and has been so almost
from birth. The complaint asks that
the father be compelled to pay the blind
son sufficient money every month to
maintain him decently, according to his
station in life. It also asks that a suf
ficient sum be paid for skillful surgical
and medical treatment for his eyes,
which he has been informed by com
petent medical authority may be cured,
wholly or at least partially, by proper
treatment. Another demand is for funds
to pay for an education that will ren
der the plaintiff self-supporting.
The attorney for the son is ex-Judge
A. F. St. Sure, who said in an interview
yesterday that since his client's birth
the father had utterly failed to provide
for his helpless son, except to give him
a watch some years ago and contribute
small sums at various times that
amounted in the aggregate to less than
$25 during the twenty-one years of the
unfortunate boy's life.
The complaint alleges that the elder
Bacigalupi owns city property valued
at $50,000 or more and is in receipt of
an income approximating 51000 a
month. Since his birth the boy has
been cared for by his aunt, a sister of
his mother, living at 144 Devisadero
street. What opportunities he has had
in the way of education and medical
treatment have been paid for solely by
her. Now she is in straitened circum
stances and can no longer provide him
with the assistance he needs. Hence
this suit.

It was reported by President Bab
cock that the subject of changes in
the shipping rules will soon be con
sidered. The coming: of the Merchant
Marine Commission to San Francisco
In August was declared to be of im
portance. While wheat falls off in vol
ume it was found to be a matter for
congratulation that the total value of
California products exported is in
creasing, the cause being diversified
farming. With cheap f u .1 oil San
Francisco was found to have a good
outlook for becoming a great manufac
turing city. Concerning two topics of
interest. President Babcock said-
SHIPPING AND FINANCE.
< â¢itipetition with wheat produced In ether
States. In thÂ« paet the prosperity of Califor
nia largely depended opon Its wheat crop, and
there it no reason why in the future It should
Dot be cue of its greatest resources. When a
HWBlfjr like France, where the land has been
cropped for centuries, can profitably produce an
annual yieia of ten million tone, or a average
r' thirty rxjshels per acre, can any one say
that this treat State of ours will never again
r*is*_ ore million tons? To-day our average
yieM'does not>xrÂ»e4 thirteen bushels per acre.
A irrrat deal can be done by the Jndl\-ldual
effort ct the farmer In planting proper seed,
ctid. p.-ith a scientific application ef the neces
sary fertilizer*, we can increase our output,
tni with profit, too, Just as the Hawaiian Isl
t.n<3s doubled their yield of sugar by the same
sc:ent!fic measure. This Is a matter of Â»uch
vital Importance to the State at large that cer
tainly the Legislature should make a liberal
appropriation for experimental purposes, as
Fuggeeted by the State Board of Trade. To
this city It Tneans much, for If we have no
Â¦wheat to export there will be practically few
â¢hips seeking our pert and our much vaunted
rcmTnerce will sink into greater Insignificance
than the position which it occupies to-day as
regarit Its foreign trade, which Is practical
ly at the" bottom of the list of the fifty rreat
mercantile port* of the world. This Is hard
for uÂ» to believe, perhaps, but It It true, never
theless.
At a recent meeting ef the California State
r>ard cf Trade the principal subject of discus-
Fiori was California wheat and Its merits in
Reviewing the work of the exchange
iluring the year President Babcock al
luded to the changes that have been
made in the rules of the grain trade.
Among the new provisions are require
ments for the registration of ware
house receipts "and regular Inspection
Â«>f lots of grain as to condition and
vresencp in warehouse at a certain
date. The most important rule con
fines the sale of futures to the floor
â¢ >f the exchange within certain hours.
This course has been adopted by all
the great exchanges in the United
Plates, and President Babcock said
That he believed it would -.. ork well in
San Francisco. The offices of the ex
change have been connected by tele
phone with the life saving station. The
Â¦>. urk of the committees during the
j>ast jrear came in for complimentary
mention.
Concerning: the wheat situation in
California, President Babcock said:
THE WHEAT SITUATION.
President Babcock appealed to the
members of the exchange to work 1 for
an increase of membership to double
the present limit. Within the hall of
the exchange, he said, will be posted
the telegraphic quotations of the great
stock exchanges of the world, the
prices of all leading products In the
exchanges of the United States anl Eu
rope, and a complete file of all the
leading newspapers of the world. The
movements of all vessels trading to or
from Pacific Coast points will be re
corded. Another feature will be views
"f trans-Atlantic lines.
ASKS 3IEMBERS TO WORK.
President William Babcock reported
to the members of the Merchants' Ex
change yesterday at their annual meet
ing that the exchange is thriving.
There is a shortage for the year of
52400. but this is due entirely to the
failing off in the wheat crop of last
year, and the consequent loss in the
business of the grain inspection de
partment of the exchange. Owing to
the loss of revenue, while the new
building for the exchange is in con
struction, it will be necessary to keep
the dues at 55 a month. The building
would be completed in September but
for the delay caused by the founda
tions. President Babcock reported
that unless something that Is not fore
seen happens the structure will be
ready to occupy by the end of the
year.
Certain Interesting facts vrere report
ed by President Babcock about the new
exchange building. Nine floors have
been leased to the Southern Pacific
Companv. The top floor will be occu
pied by "the Beard of Fire Underwrit
ers, excepting a few offices that are re
quired for the use of the exchange.
The ground floor is leased to bankers
and brokers. The second, third and
fourth floors have been partly leased.
Among the tenants will be the Mer
chants' Association and the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association.
Thus the building will become the
home, as originally planned for bodies
that are working for the advancement
of the city and State. Thirty feet of
forty feet owned by the exchange on
Montgomery street have been sold to
the Security Savings Bank, which is
erecting a banking building on the site.
An entrance ten feet wide to the ex
change building from Montgomery
street is in construction.
In supporting the constitutionality of
the law of 1903, which prevents injunc
tions against boycotting unions, Judge
Maguire maintained that the act was
not one of special legislation In that
the law restricting the use of injunc
tion is directed against seven other
classes besides that of employers. He
contended that the criminal acts com
plained of could be prosecuted under
the criminal laws and that the tempo
rary injunction issued by Judge Hunt
was an additional statute providing an
uncertain penalty for an uncertain
crime.
Mr. Van Ness answered the argument
and declared that all of Judge Ma
guire's points were unsound In that it
was attempted to deprive a property
owner of his rights without the guar
anteed recourse in the courts of equity.
Van Ness held that there was abso
lutely no remedy, if the act should be
constitutional, for the outrages com
mitted by unions under the name of
strike and boycott.
The decision of Judge Hunt will be
followed by an appeal to the Supreme
Court.
He charged that Pierce was debarred
from equity, because he was not with
out fault himself, the fault consisting
of the alleged fact that his non-union
watchman was paid by the Citizens'
Alliance.
Judge Maguire declared that the
criminal things done were not contem
plated nor sanctioned by the union. He
said that violence usually accompanies
strikes, but that it was because of the
thieves, bandits and camp followers
who usually collect at a disturbance in
order to satisfy their thirst for brutal
ity.
The courtroom of Superior Judge
Hunt's department was not large
enough to accommodate the crowd that
asked for admission yesterday to hear
the argument of Judge Maguire in de
fense of the Stablemen's Union, and
the answer thereto, by T. C. Van Ness.
representing the stable owners and the
Citizens' Alliance. t\
Judge Maguire's talk occupied all of
the morning session and a' part of the
afternoon. He devoted the greater por
tion of his argument to the contention
that the acts of assault complained of,
and proven in the testimony, were
committed by men who had not been
identified as members of the stable
men's organization. Furthermore, he
said that the commission of such acts
would have been against the interests
of the union in its purpose to accom
plish the ends contemplated, namely,
to compel Pierce to employ only union
men. -*Â¦

the Detroit station a few days ago Tom
appeared, carrying a mouse between
his teeth, as though provisioned for a

Such being the case it is the duty of employers who
have members of the guard in their employ to grant
them ample leave of absence for the encampment. It is
certainly to the interest of all business men that the
military efficiency of the guard be increased to the ut
termost, and there is no better means of doing that than
is provided by the proposed maneuvers. The matter in
deed is one of concern to the republic itself and no em
ployer should stand in the way to prevent a member of
the guard from taking part in the exercises, which, as
Major Gillette says, "should not only provide an excel
lent outing for the forces engaged, but should furnish an
experience to our officers and men that would be of incal
culable value to our country in time of war."
MAJOR GILLETTE of the. corps of engineers of
the United States army contributes to the cur
rent number of Sunset a short but fairly com
prehensive statement of the general character of the
maneuvers that are to take place in August at the grand
encampment near Paso Robles. The statement makes
clear the fact that the gathering of volunteers and regu
lars is not to be for any holiday outing, but for serious
work in solving certain important war problems that
cannot be so well learned in any other way.
In describing the course of instruction to be given
during the maneuvers Major Gillette says the trpops will
be employed in "practicing that part of the art of war
that lies beyond the drill ground and the target range,"
and adds: "The art of operating in the vicinity of an
enemy can best be learned by actual work in the field.
To camp in safety, to march so as not tp.be surprised or
ambushed, to be always ready to take an advantageous
position if attacked, to protect communications and
wagon trains, to arrange the movements of artillery,
cavalry and infantry so as not to interfere with each
other and yet be always ready for attack or defense, to
make hasty intrenchments, to improvise bridges and
â¢roads, to interpret maps and to make reconnoissances,
and in general to learn the handling of troops in the
field, are some of the things to be undertaken."
Instruction in such matters is, of course, of vital im
portance in military training, and it would avail but little
to volunteers to know how to drill with precision and to
shoot straight if they did not knojv these other things as
well. It is to be desired therefore that as many members
of the guard as possible should take part in the* encamp
ment to profit by association with the regulars in the
maneuvers.

Robbtn Island, where for many years
the diFeastd outcasts from all South
Africa have been isolated, invariably
excites the curiosity of passengers on
their arrival off Cape Town, and the
xr.ere mention of it creates a feeling of
horror in the minds of residents in the
Cape Colony. It was in the Cape As-
Etmbly the other day that Dr. Hewat,
who is one of the most prominent
medical men in South Africa, made
Borne astounding statements regarding
conditions in the leper island. The
doctor said he knew of between sixty
end seventy persons condemned to a
lifelong banishment there amid sur
roundings that were indescribable, but
who in reality never had been a source
of danger to any one and who would
. not be if allowed to go at large. In
consequence the medical man said that
he now refused to certify as lepers
those only slightly affected, as he knew
that to do so would be to banish them
at once aad for life to the dread island.
And Dr. Hewat instanced the case of
a man, who. after having been kept
on the island for eight years as a
leper, was finally discharged, it having
been established conclusively that he
had never been affected by leprosy at
all. Then this practitioner went on to
bring some amazing charges regarding
the administration of the leper Island.
Patients tent to Robben for examina
tion, he maintained, received no con
sideration at ail at the hands of the
advisory board there and were left
amid awful surroundings without hope.
The members of this advisory board,
the accuser continued, who should visit
the isiand every three months, had, in
fact, only visited it four times in three
years. In consequence of this neglect,
he declared, the unfortunates on the
island were dying like flies from tu
berculosis, due to overcrowding.
When several members of the Cape
Assembly, shocked by Dr. Hewat's
statements, visited Robben Island the
other day, they were met by a half
crazy wretch, who implored the vis
itors' help. A carpenter of Southamp
ton, England, he went to work at Kim
berley, contracted leprosy In a mild
fcrm and promptly was dragged off to
the leper Island. This was three
months ago. He now has loet all trace
of the disease, but is as much a pris
oner as if he were doing a life term of
penal servitude. Meantime he is the
more anxious to return to his family at
Kimberley, whom he has not seen
since his confinement, as they are de
pendent upon what his son, who is
only 15, can earn. Life on the island
he described as most horrible. There
are few books for the use of lepers, and
they pass the dreary days in- musing
en the terrible fate that has sent them
there. This victim adds that the food
supplied to the lepers is indifferent and
the mode of serving It bad. The man's
statements now have been Incorporated
in a Government blue book and his re
lease is likely, as well as an official in
vestigation into the conditions prevail
ing on the leper island.

WHEAT growers and millers are rallying to ac
tion in the solution of the wheat problem. The
matter, as far as it has advanced, illustrates the
mighty change that science has wrought in the arts re
lated to the soil. The French settlers in Louisiana de
voted themselves exclusively to the production of in
digo. That crop was profitable and the prosperity of
the province rested upon it. But a disease and a,para
site attacked the indigo plant and an awful calamity fell
upon rural Louisiana. It was then that the planters,
after they were practically ruined, turned to sugar-cane
and rice.
That was long ago. Had it happened now there would
have been no surrender to insects, or disease. 'Â¦ In the
far Creole days nothing was known about vegetable
pathology or the use of beneficial insects to destroy and
exterminate their predaceous brethren. Now we over
come phylloxera with resistant grape vines. We medi
cate plants that are beset by fungoid diseases, and we
clean California orchards of scale by the use of insects,
and we fight the Texas cotton weevil to a finish by im
porting ants from Guatemala. We take a beet and
breed it to find saccharine in the soil, just as we breed a
dog to find quail in the chaparral. In the lexicon of ag
riculture there is no such word as "fail."
When the first settlers plowed the prairies of Ne
braska their corn was regularly destroyed every year
by the early frost. When it was demonstrated that the
season was too short to mature that staple crop the ad
vance guard of civilization began to fall back, beaten
by General Frost. In this emergency appeared a greater
â¢leader than General Frost in the person of J. Sterling
Morton. He called a halt in the retreat from the fron
tier and told the routed settlers that what they needed
was "a ninety-day corn." "How will we get it?" howled
the discouraged and defeated plowmen. "Breed it,"
shouted the master of men, and breed he did, although
in that distant day little was understood and nothing had
been printed aboui breeding plants for a specific purpose.
He gave to Nebraska a ninety-day corn, that' was ready
for the husker three ' months after the planter put the
seed in the ground, and so saved the State to settlement
and civilization.
California is at a crisis in wheat growing. In other
days we would drop that crop entirely and find a sub
stitute for it as the Creoles did for indigo. But the
times have changed. Agriculture no longer surrenders
to conditions'". It improves them or creates new ones.
From the discussion of the failure of gluten in our
v/heat, making necessary the admixture of 20 per cent of
the gluten wheats of Kansas or Dakota to produce a
strong and merchantable flour, a few things are plainly
apparent. When our wheat made a large yield and grew
strongly on new land it contained abundant gluten and
produced a strong flour. As the land is successively
cropped and the yield per acre falls the gluten falls with
it and its place is taken by starch and we get a weak
flour.
Irrigation has been tried to induce a more vigorous
growth. But experience proves that irrigation pro
duces a "punky" wheat, very inferior and with no in
crease in gluten. When fresh seed is used, imported
from outside, the first crop is satisfactory in its gluten
content and after that comes a decline. As we cannot
afford to abandon wheat growing, as it is to be always
the main crop on our non-irrigable lands, the crisis is
real and must be met with all the weapons of warfare
furnished by modern science. It is demonstrated that
gluten is a variable quantity in our wheat. When the
plant is most vigorous it has the most gluten. The les
son is obvious. Reinforce the vigor of the plant.
If Nebraska could breed a corn so quick and vigorous
in growth that it could clear the frost in ninety days we
can find a wheat with its assimilative system strong
enough to get a due percentage of gluten out of the soil,
but we must do this by artful fertilization, fallowing and
all the other methods for promoting plant vigor. We
cannot go abroad and find a wheat that carries 50 per
cent gluten and plant it in the expectation that it will
continue to produce that much gluten, for it will not.
Fresh seed and fertilization seem to point to a solution
of this most interesting problem which the State Board
of Trade has brought into focus. The millers have sup
plied the means needed to begin the necessary experi
ments.
It is a matter that goes straight to every home in the
State aside from its commercial. feature. Everybody eats
bread, in the sweat of his own face or that of some one
else, and we demand our daily bread with less starch
and more gluten, for our people want more muscle and
less fat. Without wheat an appreciable percentage of
California land will be deprived of a profitable crop
and our export trade will suffer if we can send out no
wheat nor flour.
The eland is nearly six feet high at
the shoulder when full grown and
weighs 1600 pounds. It is not particu
larly swift (unlike most of its con
geners) and a. man can sometimes over
take it by running. Its flesh is con
sidered a delicacy. Commonly it
browses in herds In the waterless des
erts of South Africa, to which it is na
tive. Its ability to get along for months
together without water being a mys
tery. To some extent, doubtless. It de
pends upon moisture derived from suc
culent plants, such as the wild water
melon.
There are two varieties of eland, one
being reddish in color and the other
(known as the Livingston eland)
striped. It is one of about 200 species of
antelopes found in South Africa, where
animals cf this genus seem to have un
dergone the most extraordinary differ
entiation. Some of them are the swift
est runners of all animals, and certain
kinds are so wild and wary that hunt
ers cannot possibly get within gunshot
of them unless by the help of what Is
known as an artificial ostrich â a Hot
tentot contrivance, consisting of the
skin of an ostrich arranged to disguise
a man, who holds the head of the sup
posed bird aloft by means of a stick
thrust through the neck.
Elands are becoming scarce in South
Africa. Though they seem (o be the
most desirable species for importation
into this country, there are others
vhich might be valuable â notably the
srringbok, which is a graceful creature
less than three feet in height, of a beau
tiful fawn color, a prolific breeder and
well suited to the conditions, climatic
and otherwise, of the arid regions of
Arizona, New Mexico and Southern
California.â Saturday Evening Post.
leng, the Department of Agriculture
having given its approval to the Idea.
All that is needed is money, which
Congress will be asked to give. The
animals, which are the largest of all
antelopes, would be very valuable in
the desert regions of the Southwest as
a source of meat supply. They require
almost no water, are accustomed to
forage for themselves and are quite
tractable.
1 tient man who has been working so constantly and quiet
ly in their midst and that while they 'are pleased to call

Among the most startling of Burbank's successes, is
the anomally of a white blackberry, resembling clusters
of pearls. More marvelous still are a number of varie
ties of stoneless plums. Professor Wickson says of
them: "The kernel is fully developed, but nakedâ no
hard substance intervenes between it and the pulp. To
â¢take up a plum and bite through it without hesitation re
quires education, so strong is the conception of the dan
ger involved, but to bite freely and find the flavor en
hanced by the nutty savor of the kernel brings reward ia ,
the new sensation which the palate experiences."
Another of Burbank's creations is what he has named
the "plum-cot," a new fruit, the offspring of the plum
and rpricot. He has developed a giant prune, new styles
in berries and even provided vegetable monstrosities. In
v/rrting of his friends, the fruits and flowers, Burbank
says: "We have learned that they are as plastic in our
hands as clay in the hands of the potter or color on the
artist's canvas and can readily be molded into more beau- *
tiful forms and colors than any painter or sculptor can
ever hope to bring forth."

A. C. Freese, former Public Admin
istrator, yesterday sued John C. Lynch,
Collector of Internal Revenue for this
district, for the refund of $68638
taxes paid under protest for the estate
of James V?. Singer, who died Septem
ber 19. 1898. The tax was collected
under the provisions of the war
revenue law of 1898, but Freese al
leges that the distributive portion of
the estate was worth less than $10,000
and not subject to the tax. Further
more, the demand for payment by the
Revenue Collector was made four
years after the estate had been dis
tributed and after Freese had retired
from office. Freese's demand for the
remission of the tax was turned down
by the Government.

The property on Montgomery street,
a short distance south of Bush, a half
interest in which belongs to the heirs
of the late J. C. Yoell, will occupy the
attention of the courts for a while.
Yesterday Fred A. Vollmer, through
his attorneys, Bishop. Wheeler &
Hoefler. commenced suit asking the
Superior Court to declare that a parti
ton of the property would be prejudi
cial to the owners and to order a sale
and the distribution of the proceeds
among all who have an interest there
in. Vollmer claims an undivided half
interest in the property and the re
mainder belongs to the dozen or more
heira of Yoell. Vollmer's interest is
subject to a mortgage of $27,500, held
by the Hibernia Savings and Loan So
ciety. The other owners and cotenanta
will have to set forth their interests in
court before the sale can be ordered.

sors were appointed. The assignments
follow:
The Grand Lodge set aside a stated
sum to meet the expenses of grand of
ficers who during the year make of
ficial visits to the subordinate lodges.
The new constitution was taken up,
acted upon by section, and after re
vision and amendment, adopted as a
whole, and will hereafter be the guide
for the grand body. The same course
was pursued as to the new constitution
for the subordinate bodies.
It was also decided to have an or
ganizer in the field for the ensuing
twelve months.
The next session of the grand body
will be held in the city of Oakland on
July 18, 1905, upon invitation of Albion
Lodge.
In the evening a banquet in a
Powell-street restaurant to the retiring
and new officers and delegates was
given by Pickwick and Burnaby
lodges, acting Jointly in the entertain
ment of the guests. About 150 were
present, including ladles in the dining
hall, which was very artistically deco
rated with evergreens and festoons,
together with English and American
flags. The tables were also tastefully
decorated with roses, carnations and
smilax. It was a happy gathering that
during the evening rose and drank
the health of the King of England and
that of the President of the United
States. The toastmaster was Past
Grand President F. D. Brandon. The
toasts and those who responded to
them were: "The Empire of To-Day,"
Austin Lewis; "The Order," Grand
President Johnson; "Sons of St.
George," Past Grand President Charles
W. Pope; "Canada," J. L. West; "Our
Brothers in the Sunny South," Robert
Sharp, P. G. P.; "General Remarks,"
T. B. Bradbury, P. G. P.; "Our
Brothers in British Columbia," W. H.
Price, and "The Ladies," G. E. Fisher.
Those who contributed to the musical

V. Noyes, and an orchestra while the
King was toasted played "God Save
the King" and rendered "The Star-
Spangled Banner" when President
Roosevelt was toasted.
Riverside Lodge, recently instituted
by R. Sharp, P. G. P., was presented
by the grand body with a set of
officers' regalia.
The Grand Lodge of the Sons of
St. George closed its business in Red
Men's Hall late yesterday afternoon
with the installation of the officers
elected on the previous day. The in
stalling officer was Past Grand Presi
dent Robert Sharp, who was assisted
by Past Grand President F. D. Bran
don. The installation was followed by
the presentation of a handsome jewel
to retiring Grand. President J. H.
Cocking.
The per capita tax was fixed at $1
for the current year.
Giovanni Spingola yesterday filed
suit for divorce against his wife Maria
on the ground of cruelty. Among the.
speciflc acts complained of is refusal
to nurse him when he was ill with ty
phoid fever. After he had spent two
months in the country recovering hl3
health he came home and she is said to
have declared she would rather have
had him come home in a coffin.
It's a rare occasion when cruelty to
a wife Is supplemented by charge of
cruelty to the children in a complaint
for divorce, but Viola B. Daulton In a
suit for separation from Frank Daul
ton declares that besides threatening
to kick and kill her he choked their
daughter Effle and swung Gertrude,
another child, around several times by
the hair. Daulton Is said to own two
lots and a home on Carter street.
Other suits for divorce were filed by
Anna A. Tornroth against Werner
Tornroth for desertion; Josephine M.
Rodgers against Bertram Rodgers,
failure to provide; Kate Fowler against
John Fowler, neglect; Clara Hinehcllffe
against William Hinchcllffe, neglect.
Divorces were granted by Judge Ker
rigan to William A. Howey from Ro
setta Howey, extreme cruelty; to
Jeanette Elgle Paine from William B.
Paine, neglect; by Judge Troutt to Ad
die B. Foley from Ed F. Foley, deser
tion; Mary Agnes Lunn from Charles
A. Lunn, neglect: to Albert W. Bense
man from Julia Benseman, cruelty.
WISHED HE WAS DEAD.
On the following day the man Is said
to have represented to her that as she
had spent the night in his apartments
she was disgraced in the eyes of the
world and although nothing improper
had happened it would not be believed
that she was innocent.
Being only 21 years old and "unused
to the ways of the world," she says
that she believed his statements and
was overwhelmed with grief and an
guish. He insisted that she should
marry him to save her reputation. She
declares that he made the representa
tions for the purpose of "mortifying her
spirit and shaming her," and placed
her in a false position in order to com
pel her to marry him. He declared she
could only remove the stigma by be
coming his wife, and believing this she
consented. They were united on July
11. Immediately she discovered the
falsity and fraud of his conduct, and
now. ten days after the ceremony, she
seeks a legal separation, averring that
they have never sustained the relation
of husband and wife.
Ada R. Duncan, who sued Benjamin
B Duncan of W. B. Cluff & Co. for di
vorce on sensational grounds, and
whose case has since appeared in the
Police Court by reason of the violent
actions of her brother-in-law, yester
day began suit In the Superior Court
to recover from W. C. Duncan, her
husband's brother, the value of $1000
worth of furniture alleged to have been
removed from the family home on
June 8, 1903. Mrs. Duncan also filed a
supplementary complaint to her suit
for divorce, alleging the brother-in-law
and Duncan's sister, Eva. were in pos
session of $3000 cash belonging to Dun
can and $2000 worth of community
property.
In her suit for annulment Blanche
Gore Meyer tells a story stranger than
fiction. She says that on July 9 Meyer
was temporarily domiciled at a hotel in
San Francisco. He pretended to be ill
and sent for her to come and nurse
him. Believing him to be in need of
.her attention, she went to the hotel
and remained with him for several
hours, doing the good offices seemingly
demanded by his condition. Finally,
believing that her presence was no
longer needed, she prepared to leave the
apartments, but Meyer insisted that she
remain with him. Under his compulsion
she did remain throughout the night.
DISGRACED HERSELF.
An inspection of the records of the
local courts developed the fact that on
April 19 Meyer was divorced by his
wife, Grace A. Meyer, and that she ob
tained the custody of their two chil
dren.
An unophlsticated maiden acting as
nurse for a friend, who was the father
of a family but divorced from his wife,
was made the victim of a cruel play
upon honor, according to the complaint
filed yesterday In the Superior Court
by Blanche Gore Meyer for an annul
ment of her marriage with William H.
Meyer.
Her story is a tale of the wiles of a
conscienceless man. The Lick House
was the scene of the affair, although
it is not mentioned in the complaint.
Inquiry made of her attorney, G. Gun
zendorfer, discloses that the parties are
not of prominence outside of their own
circles. The lawyer says the girl is all
that she represents herself to be In the
way of maidenly innocence, and that
the man in the case is without prop
erty, means or employment, and his
reputation is nil. He is said to be a
citizen of New York and to have lived
there on West One Hundred and Twen
ty-eighth street.
No legal move was made in the Dol
beer case yesterday. The petition for
the probate of the will has been set for
hearing in Judge Coffey's department
of the Superior Court on August 2. At
that time Kiram W. Johnson will file
a contest to the will on behalf of
Henry Schander of Sacramento, uncle
of the late Miss Dolbeer. It is believed
others will take the same action, as it
will place them in a position to be par
ties to the compromise it is said tho
principal devisees are willing to enter
do.
If unfortunate Bertha M. Dolbeer
had felt a premonition of the disap
pointment and mystery that would fol
low her taking off, doubtless her good
heart would have failed her. She
would have borne her burdens in
pilence or disposed of her vast wealth
otherwise than by will.
There is no one of the many made
poorer by the loss of her association,
end richer with her gold, that is not
aiding in an effort to shroud her death
with mystery and to cloud the facts
that surrounded the making of her last
will. Her chief beneficiary. Miss Etta
M. Warren, is ill, all admit, and from
her DO explanation can be expected.
But then* are others â friends or of
distant kinâ who also find it advan
tageous to announce tl.at they are
prostrated with the shock and sorrow
that came with the tragedy.
None of these will be seen. The same
strange condition prevails in the
camps of the proponents of the will
and of the prospective contestants.
"William G. Mugan. one of the execu
tors of the will, is as exclu
sive as the others. He remains
in his private office and denies himself
to every caller whose business relates
to the Dolbeer estate. This but adds to
the mystery all seem determined shall
veil the case. They all claim they have
nothing to hide, but they hide that
nothing welL

' Miss Hapgood tells how she '
escaped an awful operatioa by
using Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound.
" Deab Mrs. Pikkham : â I suffered
for four years with what the doctors
called Salpingitis (inflammation of the
fallopian tubes and ovaritis), which is
a most distressing and painful ailment,
affecting all the surrounding parts,
undermining the constitution, and sap-
ping' the life forces. If you had seen
me a year ajro, before I bejran taking
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, and had noticed the
Bunken eyes, sallow complexion, and
general emaciated condition, and com-
pared that person with me as I am to-
day, robust, hearty and well, you
would not wonder that I feel thankful
to you and your wonderful medicine,
which restored me to new life and
health in five months, and saved me
from an awful operation." â Miss Irejte

Out. â $5000 forfeit If original of above letter

Ovaritis or inflammation of the
ovaries or fallopian tubes which adjoin
the ovaries may result from sudden
stopping 1 of the monthly flow, from
inflammation of the womb, and many
other causes. The slightest indication
of trouble with the ovaries, indicated
by dull throbbing pain in the side, ac-
companied by heat and shooting pains,
should claim your instant attention.
It will not cure itself, and a hospital
operation, with all its terrors, may
easily result from neglect.

A Gigantic Spectacular Burlesque.In the ninth Eagan slugged to the
right field fence. Sharp fielding by
McCreedle held him at first. Then
Lynch singled and McLaughlin made
one good for two sacks. Hastings, evi
dently rattled, tossed wild to Drennan,
who was holding down first, and every
body came home.
Graham died gracefully, but Hogan
scored on St. Vrain's liner to Druhot
in center field. Iberg then went into
the box. Doyle singled and Sheehan
made' a two-bagger. Nadeau's - long
throw nailed the latter at the plate
and the run getting ended, but the
Tigers had won.
In the sixth, Campbell at third nearly
lost a finger off his right hand. Steel
man went to fill that station and Shea
played behind the bat. Steelman was
the pivot . of a beautiful double play
soon after taking third, nailing a hard
liner from Graham and shooting the
ball to Castro at second in time to
catch Hogan. The score:

TIGERS AWAKEN' IX XINTH.
There was sadness on the counten
ance of Paul Steindorff last night and
starvation in the features of Ferris
Hartman. Behind the Tivoll^ curtain
rose the pungent aroma of fishâ not the
appetizing odor of little fishes fresh
from the brook, but the potent scent
of fish that were overdue for burial a
week ago.
Two boxes labeled "Yosemite trout"
arrived yesterday at the theater. One
was addressed to Hartman, the other
to Steindorff. Each thereupon tele
phoned to his respective better half to
be haughty toward the butchers and
get busy with the limes and mayon
naise.
At 4 p. m. the box of "brook trout"
arrived at the Hartman domicile, 633
Willow avenue. Mrs. Hartman opened
the box. and immediately, afterward
all the doors and windows in the house.
Given a week and a half to muster
scent In, thirty brook trout can cer
tainly make their presence known,
especially when they are assisted by
twenty-five sardines that were old resi
dents of the Mediterranean when Gari
baldi was a kid.
An excited neighbor telephoned the
Coroner's office, saying that some one
in the Hartman home had been dead
for some time. The comedian's wife
sent the package back to the Tivoli.
At the Steindorff home, 915 Eddy
street, another case of mummified
speckled beauties was opened. It was
no Jest there. The flve-Uttle Stelndorffs
were waiting: for their flshies. Like the
four and twenty blackbirds that began
to sing when the pie was opened, the
trout got noisy in another way. They
paralyzed the olfactory nerves of tha
little Stelndorffs and spread their
aroma over a radius of twelve blocks,
the messenger boy took them back to
the Tivoli and hurried to the Board of
Health for chloride of lime or anything
that smelled clean.
As Steindorff and Hartman were about
to depart to feast on brook trout they
smelt a rat â or rather a fish or two.
They did not dine. Yesterday evening
"Robin Hood" was produced with a
starved comedian and a hungry orches
tra leader. They were hot. too. They
had paid $3 In express charges for the
speckled dainties.
After the performance they sent a $27
telegram of thanks to the kind friend*
who shipped the fish from Yosemite.
The telegram was wired "collect." The
wilted trout were consigned to the
garbage crematory.
REFUSES TO PUT FREE
L.UXCHES UNDER THE BAS
Supervisors' Police Committee Denies
Petition to Prohibit an Estab
lished Saloon Custom.
The Supervisors' Police Committee
yesterday denied the petition of the
Retail Merchants' Association that an
ordinance be passed prohibiting the
giving away or sale of lunches or eat
ables In saloons. The committee did
not think it in the power of the Su
pervisors to prevent a man from hav
ing a free lunch in his establishment.
The committee recommended that
the sum of S8 be refunded to D. S.
Lewis, which he paid to the pound
keeper for the release of two illegally
impounded cows. Testimony was giv
en that the poundkeeper's deputy had
snatched the rope away from a boy
who was leading the two cows.' Wil
liam Doell had $2 50 refunded, which
he paid to the poundman to release a
dog which was in his possession when
impounded.
Commissioners Divide Precinct.
The Election Commissioners met
last night. The annual report was
filed by Registrar Adams, showing a
surplus of J2 71. Of the money dis
bursed was $ 21,367 for a brick ware
house for storing booths. Edward
Ewald presented a petition requesting
that the Eightieth Primary Precinct
be divided, with the result that a
resolution was adopted dividing thÂ»
precinct, giving: a polling place to th"
Almshouse and one to the voters of
Sunset and Carville. Tenth and If

of the United States Standard voting
machine will be determined Monday

Oakland got one in the first round
on Ganley's hit and steal 'and Schla
fiey's nice drive to center. In the sixth
they landed again, when Streib was
given a life on Delehanty's miscue and
came all the way to the rubber on Me-
Kune's two-cushion drive away out to
center field.
It looked as though Oakland might
have a chance, for the Commuters were
fighting hard and playing the game
well in every department. , But the
eighth inning settled the strife. A base
on balls and a couple of scratchy hits
filled up the bags. Hall's long fly to
deep center brought in a run and Dev
ereaux's error of the throw in advanced
the two base runners on the bacrs.
Parke Wilson swung through to left
field with a timely old single, bringing
in two more and breaking up the game
on the spot. The score:

Umpire â McCarthy.
Oakland played the game in fairly
good style, considering that an ama
teur, McKune, was stationed at short
to stop the torrid ones that came roll
ing on the green. They made a good
uphill fight, too, and all. but tied
up the score. . But when Seattle
landed thrice in the eighth round, the
Commuters quit, for the rally of the
northern hosts took all the fight out of
them. ;-. v :^ Â¦_-;.:.:
Mr. Hopkins, southpaw, bowed before
a Recreation Park gathering yesterday
afternoon for the first time in his life.
Mr. Hopkins is the latest importation
by Peter Lohman. He came all the
way from Colorado Springs with the
intention of handing it out to the ball
teams of the Pacific Coast. But his
first attempt was a failure, for the
Siwashes bumped him when bumos
counted most, and they won. Score â
Seattle 6, Oakland 2.
Mr. Hopkins was a sufferer from hard
luck and an umpire's injustice. He
held the sluggers of the north safe ex
cept in two rounds, yet they accumu
lated enough runs in these periods to
carry them through. He was a victim
of the umpire's bad judgment in the
second inning, when he had Smith
struck out. The umpire thought not. so
three runs soon followed.

SAN DIEGO, July 21. - Commodore
J. J. Jenkins of the South Coast Yacht
Club of Los Angeles, and San Pedro
will arrive here this evening for the
purpose of making investigation into
the conditions governing the Lipton
challenge cup races. The rules, govern
ing these races have been changed re
cently from the rules of the Great
Lakes, under which none of the yachts
of the Pacific Coast were built, to the
Seawanhaka, rules under which* thev
were all built and have raced. The
races are to be held on the 23d 24th
and 25th of. August, and the present
disposition is to make them a success
throughout.
The South Coast Club will send in
all about three yachts, the Mischief
Venus and Jlarie to enter the race as
challenger, and there will be three
others to attend i the races and possi
bly to enter. The three others are
Katrinu, Osborne and Portola. The
visiting yachtsmen took a look at the
San Diego yacht 1 Detroit, and they de
clare that there was nothing in her to
make any one of their boats stay out
of the race. Commodore Jenkins de
clared that the members -of the South
Coast Club were true yachtsmen, and
could look certain defeat in the face
with almost as much satisfaction a.i
though it were certain victory if a
good race were going to be sailed.

NEW YORK, July 21.â John J.
Ryan is going to quit the turf. He
has announced a disposal sale of his
entire stable at Brighton on July 28
and this will mark the passing of one
more Western plunger turfman. His
turf doings in the East and West have
kept the racing public supplied with
more or less unpleasant gossip for the
last year or two. Ryan's horse Mon
ster won the July stakes at Brighton
to-day., It was not an important
stake, as such things go in these days
of tremendous value, but it was im
portant to Ryan from a speculative
point of view.
Monster was heavily backed at. 6
to 1 and this may be about the last
of many a big betting coup success
fully put through by this remarkable
plunger. The retirement of * Ryan is
ostensibly for rest and to enable him
to take his family abroad for some
years.

This Attraction and Two Good Stakes
Will Keep the Leashmen Busy
Figuring Winners.
LILY WRIGHT AND DOREEX
TO MEET AT INGLESIDE
Yesterday was a scorcher at Battling
Nelson's quarters at Larkspur. The
boys of the camp, led by Captain Metz
ner, went on an exploring expedition
in the morning to Baltimore Canyon.
Metzner claimed the canyoi was alive
with deer, but the boys said they were
from Missouri. The afternoon was de
voted principally to boxing and Nelson
made life miserable for Frank New-,
house and Frank Raphael.
Jack Cordell joined the camp to-day,
but refused to don the mitts on ac
count of the heat. Jack watched Bat
tling box with Frank Newhouse and
said he looks good to him.
Many people visit the camp every
day and all express surprise at the
speed displayed by Nelson. Trainer
Murphy thinks the odds on the coming
bout will be about 10 to 8, i ith Bat
tling on the short end.
â¢ Trainer Frank McDon: d believes
that variety in exercising Is the spice
of training, and with a view to carry
ing out his belief he had his charge,
Eddie Hanlon, go through his gymna
sium stunts yesterday in a way some
what different from that pursued here
tofore. Instead of punching the bag for
six rounds consecutively, Eddie swat
ted it for two rounds, then donned the
mitts for two rounds with Toby Irwin,
after which he manipulated the wrist
machine. for six minutes and then took
Fred Landers for two more rounds of
boxing. â¢ Six minutes' shadow sparring
and two additional rounds of boxing
with Irwln and Hanlon's work for the
afternoon was complete.
In the morning Eddie traveled the
road for six miles with Irwin and Ted
Wolfe and after returning to his quar
ters was rubbed down. Hanlon evinced
a desire to walk and run more than the
scheduled six miles fixed for him by
Trainer McDonald and for this he was
taken to task by his watchful handler.
"Thus far shalt thou go and no far
ther," said McDonald to Eddie, and the
latter replied that he wouldn't do it
again. Hanlon is like an unbroken colt
in his training and McDonald is kept
busier telling him what not to do than
he is in coaching him what to do. Few
fighters are always as ready for hard
work as is Hanlon and that is why his
trainer has to watch him so clocely to
prevent the little boxer doing too
much.

and Dapple Gold in the sixth.
Only by a few inches was the last
race won and the victory was particu
larly timely to the stable. Buckleya
ivas beaten by a very small margin.
Because Rawhide had run second to
Albula at FoTt Erie, he was installed
:-. favorite, but steadily receded. After

Without doubt, the California colt,
Humo. winner of the fifth race, is des
tined to play an important part on the
line in races where he is asked to run
over a distance of ground. Early pace
making is not his forte, especially In a
large field. He was up with his pelt
to-day at the half distance, with Burns,
his Jockey, -punching" him to keep
him up with the others. The question
i hen was as to getting through on the
stretch turn and this was attended to
by Wonderly on Caper Sauce, who car
ried out Gold Ten and Tongorder, the
latter losing much ground. This let
Humo and St. Bellane through in a
flash.

Arabs Is Almost Ready.
The new towboat Arabs, which has been
built by the Fulton Iron Works for the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company, Is almost ready
for service. She ban not had her official trial
trip yet, but the builders' had her out for a
spin the other day and the new boat showed
her ability to sail all around the specifications
by which her ownera will judge the latest
addition to their fleet. The Arabs is almost
Identical in appearance and strength with the
Santa Ke Company's tug Richmond. She will
be used by the Pacific Mall Company
as a tender and to assist the Panama
and Oriental lineÂ« In docking. She will re
place the Millen Griffith, a time-worn craft.
wbcee value as a towboat has been for many
days purely perfunctory. The captain of
the Arabs has not been named, but Jt Is
understood that an experienced towboat man
will be selected, as with the Increasing eize
of the mail company's vessels skilled assistance
In docking is becoming even more of a neces
sity than it has been In the part.
The Arabs is fitted with a powerful steam
capstan, has an electric light plant. Is equipped
with pumps which will be Invaluable In fight
ing fire and in every other way is up-to-date.
Although built here, for service* in this har
bor, her home port, according â¢ to the legend
engraved acroce her stern, la New York.

a boat manned and equipped In accordance
with the regulations of the German mercantile
marine was turned adrift under orders to make

July for Port Blake'.ey, is havfng a
hard time to get away from the coast
and out amonjr the kind of ocean
breezes suited to her mode of travel.
When day broke yesterday morning
ihe United States Weather Boreau ob
servers stationed at Point Reyes dis
covered the Geneva anchored about 150
lards from the promontory.
The weather was hazy and for once
there was nothing doing in the zephyr
line at the windiest cape in America.
All day long the Geneva rolled in the
EweU, the rattle of her cordage and
spars makins up to the men at the
Â¦"eather station fc.-r the unwonted ab
sence of the wind's roar.
AVERS THAT'HIS ARREST
WAS MADE MALICIOUSLY
A. Xeuvohner Swears to a Complaint
Against Thomas Clay and Will
Sue for Damages.
A. Xeuvohner, 526 Sixth street, yes
terday swore to a complaint before
Police Judge Fritz charging: Thomas
Clay with maliciously procuring a war
rant for his arrest on a charge of ob
taining money by false pretenses. Neu
vohner says that he will also sue Clay
for damages in the civil courts.
The warrant was sworn to by Clay
for Neuvohner's arrest before Police
Judge Conlan on July 2. Clay, who
had an office in the Crossley building,
alleged that Neuvohner induced him
to purchase his one-half interest in
the "Little Hungary" roadhouse on
the San Leandro road for $800, which
was paid to Nuevohner at the Western
National Bank. The day following
Clay had to pay $150 rent. He de
clared that instead of the roadhouse
paying a good percentage on the in
vestment the daily receipts did not ex
ceed 65 cents, fitii' 1
When the case was called in Judge
Conlan's court Clay failed to appear to
prosecute and after two continuances
it was dismissed for lack of prosecu
tion. Neuvohner alleges that Clay's
statements were false. Clay is an Eng
lishman, but claims, it is said, to be
a grandson of Henry Clay, the famous
statesman. He is thought to have left
the city.

Keeps After Von Tiedemann.
Acting under instructions from Dr.
Dudley Tait, president of the State
Board of Medical Examiners, Henry
Wax, 426 Eleventh street, swore to a
complaint before Police Judge Con
lan yesterday charging Dr. Carl W.
von Tiedemann with practicing medi
cine without a license. Wax said that
Von Tiedemann had attended his wife
in her sickness and had sent him a bill
for $30. Von Tiedemann surrendered
himself at the City Prison and after
being booked on the charge was re
leased on bail, j He has an appeal be
fore the Supreme Court against a prior
conviction on a similar charge and
says he believes it will be sustained,
as his application for examination has
been before the board for the last two
years.

MOTORMAX EXONERATED
FOR A CHILD'S DEATH
Horticultural Commissioner Ehrhorn '
of Santa Clara County will probably,
succeed Alexander Craw as quarantine
officer against insect pests dangerous ;
to trees and vines in California. The"!
appointment has not yet been made by
Ellwobd Cooper, State Horticultural
Cdmmissioner, but the news from San
Jose, derived from trustworthy sources, ]
leaves little doubt that Ehrhorn is the ;
man. He has obtained the indorsement'
of S. F. Lieb of San Jose and of the '
leading fruit growers and canners of
the State. Ehrhorn has conferred with
Horticultural Commissioner Cooper and
has practically been assured that he is .
the leading candidate for the place. He ,
was required to get the indorsement of
men of weight engaged in horticulture
and viticulture or in the interests that
are bound up with these industries, and
in this he has succeeded.
From.theflrst Mr. Ehrhorn has been
favorably mentioned. His duties in
Santa Clara County have been princi
pally those of county entomologist. He
has, however, had experience in the
quarantine work that he will be called
upon to perform, having formerly been .
associated with Alexander Craw in this
city in the service of the State. : j
It is supposed that the appointment '
of Ehrhorn" will be announced in a few i
days, as Mr. Craw will depart for Ha
waii under a five years' contract at;
$5000 per annum about the middle of
next month, and will require some time i
to attend to his own private affairs be- j
fore he leaves. The position that Mr. |
Ehrhorn will occupy pays $200 per
month, and it is considered very im- j
portant to the fruit interests of the j
State.

George Spencer, charged with keep
ing an opium : 8moklng place on Stock
ton-street, and eight â¢ >ien and one
â¢woman accused' of being inmates of the
"joint" were discharged by Judge Fritz,
who said he felt certain that the de
fendants were guilty, but unfortunate
ly their guilt could not be legally
The material evidence consist
ed of half a dozen complete "pipe-hit
ting" outfits which the police found in
the | room occupied by the defendants,
all of whom had apparently, been smok
ing, and this "paraphernalia * the Judge
refused to order returned to Spencer.
"I .won't sign . any such order," he
said, "and if you get the stuff back it
"â¢ Preparatory to departing on vacation
next Saturday Judge Mogan is clearing
off his calendar of continued cases and
taking up no new Complaints, and the
vigor with which he is working war
rants a prediction that ere the week
expires he will run out of material.
Among the sentences handed down by
him yesterday were:
Innocente Glannlni, passing a ficti
tious check, three months; Y. Sodo, re
sisting a police officer, ten days; G.
Iwatankl, plumbing without license,
twenty days; Bessie Russen, Violet
Weaver and Truly Thome, I selling
liquor without license, $20 apiece.
Frank Kato, a Japanese cook, was
given three months' imprisonment by
Judge Conlan for having annoyed
Miss Matilda Gunzbergfcr, a waitress,
until she found his arrest essential to
her comfort. They worked together
at 320 Mason street, where Frank's at
tentions to Matilda became so irri
tating that she complained of his con
duct to their common employer and
his dismissal was the result. Then he
made a practice of hounding her and
alternating professions of admiration
with threats of violence.
Miss Rose Decker of 326 Mason
street showed such slight respect for
the dignity of Judge Fritz's court that
she' was fined $5 for contempt. She
was accused by Miss Pearl Rodgers of
illegally detaining a trunk containing
that young woman's wardrobe and
when the complaint was read to her
she laughed it to scorn. Then she in
sisted' that yesterday was Friday, de
ppite the Judge's assertion that it was
Thursday and carried her impudence
so far as to flatly refuse compliance
with the court's order that Miss Rod
gers be permitted to obtain some nec
essary articles of apparel from the
trunk. But not until she conveyed her
disorderly conduct to the corridor did
his Honor command that she be
brought back and charged with con
tempt. She paid the fine.
Mrs. Gertrude Hoffman of 172 Dor
land street failed to convince Judge
Mogan that Ong Gomie, a washerman,
was responsible for her alleged loss of
two diamond rings that disappeared
from the casket of jewelry which she
placed for hiding in a bundle of. soiled
linen. It was proved that Ong found
the box in the 'bundle and that he
marked on the cover of the former
the number of articles it contained, all
of which were restored to Mrs. Hoff
man when she applied for them at the
laundry. The Chinese was discharged.
Edward F. Beach, a carpenter, was
ordered-by Judge Mogan to pay his
wife $10 a month for the support of
their infant child. The~ woman stated
that she has been married thirteen
months and that her husband was
good to her until he went to Woodland
to work and there became enamored
of one "Jess," whom he brought back
to the city with him and installed in
his father's house, where he also
dwells.
Among the defendants sent to the
Superior Court by Judge Mogan were
Harry Scott, Edward Wood and Ed
ward Burke, for holding up Florain
Andre and robbing him of $80, with
bail fixed at , $1000 apiece; Frank
Jackson, for stealing a horse and bug
gy from the Haslett Warehouse Com
pany, bail of $2000.
Judge Conlan held E. R. Bratton for
forgery in $2000, and Walter Jen
kins for waylaying and robbing three
Chinese in Union Square in $3000.
Joe Podesta, who has attained some
local fame as an amateur lightweight
boxer, told Judge Fritz that he will
endeavor to pay his wife, from whom
he is separated, $4 a week for the sup
port of their infant child, although his
weekly salary as a grocer's assistant Is
only $9, and he has ceased depending
upon his fistic art far money-getting.
Moreover, he did not believe the woman
should be allowed to handle the money,
as she is givej to beer-tippling and
even more reprenensible failings, one of
them being a penchant for taking trips
to Canada with a man who is not her
father, although she told all her friends
that he bore that relationship to her.
However, he would endeavor to abide
by the decision of the referee, although
he reserved the right to believe that a
draw would have been more in the line
of justice.
Superior Judge Kerrigan has re
strained Police Judge Conlan 'from en
forcing his order that a Kearny- street
pawnbroker restore to Elbert C. Laws
one diamond-etudded gold badge which
the latter alleges was pledged for a
loan af $50 without his knowledge or
consent. The injunction suit will be
thrashed out in the higher tribunal
some time next week and until it la
decided the knight of the three balls
will retain possession of the badge.
According to- the testimony on which
Judge Conlan based his order, the
badge was presented to Laws by Aerie
No. 61, Fraternal Qrder of Eagles, of
which he is a past president, and was
borrowed from him â¢ by " one Carl
Schwartz, its designer and maker,
whose ostensible purpose was to use It
as a model for the manufacture of a
duplicate. Soon afterward Mr. Schwartz
abruptly left the city and tTien it was
discovered that for some "time prior to
his departure the jewelry business con
ducted by him on Market street was
in shaky conation and that he had
pawned for $50 the badge lent to him
by Mr. Laws, telling the pawnbroker
that its owner needed the money to
meet some pressing obligations and
was ashamed to dispose of the badge
himself. The pawnbroker in whose
possession the emblem was found- re
fused to give it up unless he received
the principal sum with interest that he
had loaned on it and Mr. Laws appeal
ed to the courts ta aid him in its re
covery.
Judge Conlan held that the pawn
broker had no legal right to keep the
badge, inasmuch as it was inscribed
with the fact that it had been pre
sented to Mr. -Laws and was not offered
in pawn by that gentleman in person.
So the pawnbroker was ordered to re
store the badge to Mr. Laws and in
stitute proceedings against the ab
sentee Schwartz for recovery of the
money advanced to him. Instead of
doing that the pawnbroker's attorney
hurried to the City Hall and obtained
the restraining order from the Superior
Court.
Just where Schwartz lsiat present no
one connected with the case seems to
know.
Patrolman McHugh arrested Ira C.
Hayes for conducting a poker game at
1219& Fillmore street, and at the same
time ran in six young men who were
on the premises and charged them with
gambling. Before Judge Conlan, how
ever, the officer couldn't swear that the
defendants were not holding a prayer
meeting or playing old maid, and dis
missal was promptly ordered.
Young W. Casteel, who shot R. TV.
Durham, manager of a business college
on Golden Gate avenue, is confined to
his home with a severe attack of ecze
ma, and said eczema being a repelling
disease Judge Mogan prudently de
clined an invitation to conclude the
preliminary hearing of the case at the
sick man's bedside. The examination
will be resumed in open court on Sep
tember 5.
Instantly, as if with a single voice,
both bench and bar exclaimed, "Why
isn't it TOpsy Turvy?"
Miss Burns calmly corraled her dis
ordered tresses and replied not. Bailiff
Conlan declared she had not seen the
joke.
It was the frowzled condition of the
woman's coiffure that inspired both
Judge Fritz and Assistant District At
torney Harris to utter the same bon
mot simultaneously.
"Your name?" said Harris.
"Topsy Burns," was the woman's an
swer.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Adolph Goldman, who shot with in
tent to kill R. W. Snow, a former
Mayor of Oakland, was sent to the Su
perior Court by Judge Mogan, with bail
fixed at $2000.
Judge Conlan sentenced Susie Rear
don to three months' imprisonment for
drunkenness after the woman had con
fessed inability to shun the cup that
inebriates. She was in the same court
on a similar charge several weeks ago
and the Judge dismissed her at the re
quest of an evangelist, who said he
could effect her reform by getting her
employed as housemaid for a respec
table family. He did so, but the first
wages received by Susie were spent for
drink. *
"It's no use trying to brace me up.
Judge," she said, "for when I'm sober I
can't stand It."
"You will have to stand it for three
months, anyway," was the Judge's
laconic response.
must be through civil process. I think
the law should provide for the destruc
tion of opium and opium-smoking im
plements."

In-Estes' Pofisfed and Engraved Turned-Wooden Boxes
These are the genuine "WORLD'S FAIR" Toothpicks, put up in handsomely engraved
and polished boxes. The engraving is in colors, directly on the wood (not a label), and the
Â» boxes are hand polished in the natural color of the wood, thus displaying to the best advantage
the fine grain of the silver white birch from which they are made. In a word, it makes a very
artistic package, and the most attractive novelty of this kind yet produced.
The "WORLD'S FAIR" Toothpicks themselves are so familiar as to hardly need de-
scription â they are rounded, polished and sliverless, and admittedly the finest and most popular
American pick on the market, and are sold in every section of this country.
In Polished '
The above cut is fac-simile of the package and exact size of box. The cover is engraved
in red and black, and as the cut reads. The box has a very neat appearance, and is filled with
about 300 of these popular, high-class toothpicks. When empty box makes a very suitable re-
ceptacle for hairpins, cuff, collar buttons, etc., and is a valuable and ornamental addition to any
dresser. The premiums are free to Want Advertisers in Sunday Call only. Gifts given Thurs-
day, Friday and Saturday.
Premiums can be obtained by presenting advertisements at:

Bell, in the semi-final round of the
open singles. The Columbian crack
won the first set after the Westerner
had gained a lead of four games on
him. He assumed the lead in the sec
ond set and seemed to have the set
well in hand, but tired rapidly from
his previous exertions and Bell won
five straight games and the set. The
third set went to Bell easily.
Columbia's Crack Player Makes Good
Start, but Bell Finishes With

CHICAGO. July 21. â Opening quotations In
September wheat were unchanged to i^c to Uc
higher, at S"6S7Uc to S7$ic. A resumption
of unsettled weather in the West and South
west was largely responsible for the firmness
manifented at the ' start. The further delay
In the marketing of new wheat, resulting from
rains, was a good reason for fresh purchases
by the holder who had sold out the day before.
In anticipation of Immediate heavy receipts.
Offerings were so light that the price was
soon more than 3c above the Initial figures.
The strength of July was reflected in the more
distant deliveries, September advancing to
8Â«%c. Sentemb-r closed at SS&SSS^c; j u j y
closed at Â»5%c.
The ctrenrth of wheat was largely responsi
ble for the firmness of corn. The market closed
almost at the high point. September closed at
49Â»4Â©4fi%c.
Hentiment in the oat market was bullish,
partly because of the strength of other grains,
but chiefly on account of the small local stocks
and the poor' prospects of receipts being much
increased in tho near future. September
closed tt 33%c.
The impression that packers were supporting
hog products turned a rather weak provision
market into a strong one. September pork was
up 12Hc and lard and ribs were up 10c at
the close. .' .

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ ThÂ« foreign markets continued
firm. The Marche Francais, the organ of the
French Millers' Association, says that the
French crop prematurely ripened before the
berry was matured and that It will in conse
quence be from 25 per cent to 30 per cent be
low that of last year. The Hungarian crop
is officially estimated at 127,200,000 bushels, :
against 151.500,000 last year.
Chicago advanced l%c. The private wires ;
of Mitchell, Mulcahy & Co. said:
â¢"The strength was on steady cables, unfav- j
orable Buropean crop news, showery weather i
through the West and lower consols. Prob- j
ably the latter had more Influence than any- ;
thing else. It was largely a covering Â¦ of
short?, of which there is a liberal class. Pri
mary receipts In excess of last year. Kansas
City reports a good cash market, but St. Louis
reports hardly go good. The millers are tak
ing the best Wheat and the elevator people j
the poorer Wheat. Cash prices a little better
than yesterday. Northwest crop reports re
main favorable. Both the supply and demand
conditions and the speculative conditions are
for the moment most uncertain. So far move
ment of new Wheat is meeting with a fair
inquiry. With good weather the movement In
likely to continue. Millers are under the
circumstances rather disposed to buy from 1
hand to mouth, and there Is no export busl- |
ness. Speculative situation Is complicated by
the European political news. While very few
believe In the probability of war, the uncer
tainty of.lt Is sufficient to keep an oversold
market In a vacillating condition."
In this market the cash grain continued
firm, though offerings were larger. Futures
were 2c higher on the morning session, with
a large business. The market is In fine shape
for sellers.

LOCAL MARKETS.
Receipts of Butter thus far this week havÂ»
averaged over 1000 boxes a day and the mar
ket Is staggering under the load. The bulk
of the creamery is going at 20c. and only the
finest brands now command 21c, and smart
buyers are getting even them at 20c. Sqme
houses have Instructed their salesmen not to
ask over 20c and to sell the goods, if not at
one price, then at aonther. for the. Butter
must be moved. Storing at current quotations
bids fair to turn out a losing business, bat
come houses have to resort to ic to get rid
of their surplus.
There Is nothing new In Cheese.
Eggs are Ic lower. The recent advance
obliged the retailers to ask the public 35c, but
the public would not pay It. so prices have
had to fall back where the retailers can again
sell at 30c. The supply is large and the de
mand is slow.

The Poultry market was In fair shape for
the selling interests, as the demand was fair,
receipts were moderate, and there was no
Weetern offering. Large young Roosters' and
Heavy Hens were- In good demand and small
young stock cleaned up well, but prices were
no higher. A car of Western falls due to-day
and will be. turned over to retailers by the
consignees. Gams was tn good request and
steady for sound stock.

r A CHEERFUL VIEW.
[Wall Street Considers the Outlook
Very Assuring.
The S'Mf York circular of Henry Clews say?:
lncr*eeing strength ar.d activity are the
features of the stock market. The most
noticeable Jnfuenoet contributing to this im
ir>rcves:er.t were, cf course, good crop reports.
Â«iiÂ«> money ar.d the certainty that the political
â¢campaign wou'.j develop no disturbing issues.
â¢ Eaxk of these facts. . however, is the support
â¢Â«:vtn tte market by the big owners of stocki.
â¢Of the latter thÂ«^re !Â« no question. They
: h<jld:cÂ«s have been rreatly aurmente>i during
the recession of the last few months; and
these gtr.tleiEen, who have the very best
jladlliiea for set-leg ahead, have undoubtedly
'cunit to the conclusion that the present is

MOXET AND STOCKS.
In this connection it is worth recalling teat
- tile Bf-vere contraction of l'JU3 forced many
Stocks belcw their intrinsic vaiues; this having
beÂ«?n demonstrated by the high rates of interest
mtich many securities were then yielding upon
their market values. At the *ame time the
, check to financial and industrial activities
vhich occurred in 1SÂ«O3. coupled with the
Â«aonnout additions to our fcold *uptlits and
cur hÂ»Â»vy bank :. :- expansion, left the money
market with an abnormal abundance of id!e
fundg seeking investment. It so happens thai
a very ccnsi'ierable portion of these funds
ha* already bv<?n absorbed in temporary rail
road leans, which will eventually be turned
into fixed capital. Another good share of this
â¢ccumulctlon has been utilized la the taking
cp of new municipal and railroad bonds,
which :cuad exceptional favor among con
servative investors an-i trust institutions. Yet,
In epite cf these past demands ui>on the
money market, thÂ»?re is still a great abundance
cf loanable fund*, and bank, reserves have
z:*ea to unusual proportions; so that bankers,
in face of larse crop demands, show no con
cern about the future of the money market.
Vmally this is the season when preparations
fcr the crop movement are in progress, and
la ordinary times no one calculates upon a
fctili movement in the stock market until thÂ»
tnore imperative dfrr.ar.iis of business and
crop* are satisfied. This year promises to be
â¢ :. exception in this respect, owing, as above
â¢tated. to the extraordinary ruethora of loan
*Â£>'.e funds. With ail doubts on this point re
saoved there is nothing to prevent the market
Irons re*j>on2inr to better crop, t-usin^ss and
political ccr.ciu&ns, and it's fact is daily be
coming more generally realized.
THE CROP OUTLOOK.
TfcÂ« outlook now ie for biff corn aad cot
ton crops. These are facts of the greatest
iniportaisce. Our corn crop. If it r^-aches
?<60Q.OUI>.000 bushels, should yield the grow
ers *bout d.QO(lOQUC0Oq, to tay i:othinÂ« of its
added value in the Â£har>e of pork and beef.
Our cotton crop. If it reaches ll.000.OuQ bales, j
will yield about 5400,OOU i *iuo to growers, to
ea>v nothing of the profits to railroads, ex-
I-urter* and manufacturers; so that from these
two croi>s alone the country's wealth will be
eugaiMitrf by more than 51,500.000.000. Other
err;* are doing fairly well, and there arÂ» no
Important rep.jrtÂ» of shortage in any direc
tion. Of course, caviare from drought now
end frwt lst*r is posElb'.e, even probable, for
cotton rsearly always deteriorates in August
and Setter. her. Yet all the crops have ma4e
Rich rood proirress and attained such strength
â¢ s to be able to withstand unfavorable con
ditions exceptionally well. The only excep
tion is Is wheat; Kansas. Missouri and Ne-
Vraska having suffered lnjurj- by exoef=iÂ«!\-e
rains eÂ»timiued at about 25.000.000 bushels.
B'Jt a eaO.OW.OOO bushel crop Is expected.
mrtlUh Â¦â¢ only 37.000.0<"iO bushels below last
>Â«-ftT, and the prkÂ». it should be noted, is
Pt 20 cents higher than a year ago.
THE BUSINESS PROSPECT.
*Â£ croj> rrospects are already exertlnt a
ulatlne effect upon business, and distrib
utors in the West a^d South are looking for
â¢Â»-ura to a satisfactory fall trade. Having
an Â«>cce?'.lor.ai!y cor.EervativÂ« policy
cur.r.g thÂ« past tw*2ve months they enter
The season ir. good f.nanc^.1 condition, with no
heavy etoefcs of merchandise carried over.
E'en is the East, where depression has been
>.?ene*t, there is a rr.cr* hopeful feeing. This

Jias *-j.H er:ierg*6 froni r'.x tncntfcs of stringent

feeling that a turn fcr the better has taken

., Potatoes continued to arrive freely and
the market ruled weak, with prices lower all
around. There was some call for cheap Bur
banks in sacks for shipment to the South
west, which held the market steady for that
class of goods, while higher grade offering*
lacked firmness, as the receipts were too heavy
for the regular trade to absorb. Salinas Bur
banks sold at a wldÂ» range as to quality.
Good Onions were firm and Silversklns had a
further advance.
v Changes In Vegetables wera slight, nearly
all kinds being in free supply. The bulk of
the receipts of Green Corn came to hand late
and large lines had to be held over. Chile
Peppers. Summer Squash and Cucumbers were
still in excessive supply and carried -over lots
of all three descriptions could be. bought below
the quotations. . String Beans were dragging,
with the canners taking -surplus Iot3 at the
minimum rate. Supplies of pickle Cucumbers
are steadily accumulating and there Is no
market for them, as the packers are not buy-
Ing, and retailers are taking only very small
quantities.

on the evening before had left a warning for
bear traders, which made them timid about
putting out short lines.
Thero was an attempt to read in the action
of Northern Securities directors in opening the
books for the transfer of holdings an intima
tion that a dividend, distribution was to be
arranged in some way which would not con
flict with the Judicial injunction upon the
vompany. Union Pacific would especially ben
efit from such an arrangement, owing to ita
large holdings of Northern Securities through
the. medium of the Oregon Short Line. The
news of the day eeemed to be little regarded
in the trading, although there was much dis
cussion of It in the Wall-street district. The
inflamed sentiment aroused in Great Britain
by the action of Russian ships in the Red Sea j
offers a palpable danger of the development
of trouble that would have far-reachinc con
sequences in the world's affairs. But the
anxiety over the matter was evidently not
very deep seated and the action of the mar
kets mast be construed as reflectlnsr a confl-
I dence that a peaceful outcome will result. The
! renewed fears of too much moisture for wheat
in th? West and Southwest helped the pressure
upon grain-carrying roads. The settlement of
the rr.eat-Dackers' strike was of very slight
effect, and was offset by the reported deter
mination of textile workers In New England
to go on strike. A fall of IVi points In Amal- j
gamated Copper measured the disappointment I
of these who had expected an increase over
the regular dividend declared.
Call money wan offered with great freedom
at 1 oer cent. Prices sold off to the lowest
late in the day, but the closing was quiet
and steady. *
Bonds were heavy. Total sales. $2,410,000.
