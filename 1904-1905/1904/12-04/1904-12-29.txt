MRS. ELLIOTT
LIVES IN FEAR
OF DR. IRVINE
Explains for First Time Her
* Position in the Bishop
Talbot Case.
Rector on Trial Twentu Years Ago
Special Dispatch to The Gall.
HUNTINGDON. Pa., Dec. 28. â Mrs.
Emma Desna Elliott consented to ex
plain to-day for the first time her po
sition In the controversy between
Bishop Ethel bert Talbot and Rev. In-
Crs ham Irvine.
Mrs. Elliott said her troubles with
Irvine started when ebe donated $30 for
church choir purposes and the rector
failed to turn over the money to the
choirmaster or to account for It.
"He is a cur and should be horse
whipped," the exclaimed.
"To tell you the truth, I am really
afraid ot Dr. Irvine. I am a South
ern woman, and my opinion of North
ern chivalry has not been improved by
my knowledge of what Dr. Irvine has
-eaid and done," Eaid she.
Mrs. Elliott's voice quivered and her
ey:s were filled with tears.
"I have hesitated to reply to tha
â base, false, cruel insinuations that
have been leveled against me by the
man whom I befriended, who brok<s
bread at my table and who took money
from my hand."
""Now. row. Emma," Interrupted Mr.
EJliott. "don't say too much. Control
yourself."
"If the truth must be known," re
plied Mrs. Elliott, "why should I not
do my part in showing this man to the
â *vorld In his true colors? He has again
tried to cast reflections upon me by
Plating that I wore purple when Bishop i
Talbot visited me. Suppose 1 did.
I frankly admit that I wore a gown of
purple on several occasions when
Bishop Talbct tvas a visitor to my
house, but I had the gown made in
' Philadelphia long before I ever knew
Bishop Talbot.
"My relations with Bishop Talbot
have been simply and only those of
t friendship. I was innocent of any
wrongdoing." ' '.' ' ...^

CHICAGO, I>ec. 28.â The Rev. Dr.
Irrtne. was tried by a commission of
Episcopal clergymen on charges of
UEtruthfulness and immorality at
Quincy tv.enty years ago. Bishop Bur- '
gess presented the charges. Rev. Dr. \
Davidson said to-night:
"The trial took place before the I
Bishop In the chapter room of the ca

" It lasted the better part of two weeks.
The only witness to the charge was

who ivas extremely simple-hearted, i
pave testimony which, while not es- j
ta.hlish.ing the exact charge, made it '
dear that Irvine was culpable. There I
vas a difference of testimony, princi

"The charge of untruthfulness. how
ever, was established. Our verdict,
therefore, found Irvine puilty of un
truthfulness without qualification, and
fustained the charge of immorality as
.to fact, but not as to date. Mr. Ir

and wife by calling attention to the
fact that the Bishop had * violated
church law by marrying a divorced
couple. A Btory came to the ears of
the latter persons, so they asserted,
that a girl had made charges against
the dean. It was found that the girl
was an opium eater. The alleged words
epoken were while she was in a den
tist's chair under the influence of gas.
The story was absolutely disproved,
and, although an ecclesiastical court
was called, Dr. Irvine never ceased to
officiate in the diocese of Quincy or
where he was located."
In support of this explanation, a let
ter from Bishop Burgess is shown
which exonerates Irvine.
PREDICTS BISHOP'S FALL.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 28.â Rev.
William S. Price, .the venerable ex
chancellor of the Episcopal diocese of
Pennsylvania, who drew up the origi
nal presentment against Bishop Talbot,
said to-day:
â¢'Talbot. I am afraid, is done for. He
has reached his end as Bishop. The
charges which have been preferred
against him are the most sensational
that I ever heard of being made against
a Bishoc" ' *
There will be no hearing of the
charges against Bishop Talbot by the
court recently appointed by Bishop
Tuttle, according to churchmen who
are well posted in the canonical laws
of the Episcopal church. A complica
tion has developed which they say will
put a stop effectually to the proceed
ings of the court of inquiry as now
constituted.
The trouble comes from a recent
change in the canons of the church re
garding tbe appointment of a courl of
that nature. The first intimation of the
trouble , comes in the shape â¢ of an edi
torial In the Church Standard, the"old
est organ of the church In this country.
MAKES PLAIN THE ERltoR.
In the issue of the Standard which
will appear : to-morrow Rev. Dr. John
Fulton, the editor, will say in reference
to the Irvine-Talbot case that the pre
siding Bishop has constituted the board
of Inquiry under a canon which, was
superseded by a new canon of the late
general convention. The new canon
will go into operation on January 1,
1905.
The board of Inquiry !b called to meet
on January 10, and when it does meet
on that day it will not be constituted
as the new canon requires. Therefore
it will have no power toÂ«proceed with
the Inquiry for which It is called.
Men versed in church law say the
only course open is to let the present
court meet on the date named. It can
then decide that it no longer has Juris
diction and refer the case back to
BiEhop Tuttle, the presiding Bishop,
for further action.
The mistake or oversight arose. It
Is said, because the movement to pro
cure a presentment against Bishop Tal
bot was begun last August and those
who had it in hand failed to take cog
nizance of the change in tne canonical
law when It was made at the last gen
eral convention.
drawn on the First National Bank of
West Superior, and were signed "Peter
the Great" and "Pope Plus X . of
Rome." .*J1 were indorsed in the flow
ing hand of St. Peter. On the tacks of
the checks were the replies of the va
rious bank tellers and many of them
would hardly be approved by the ln
doraer and his representative at Rome.
"Those grain men have fooled me,"
said Redmond, as the tears came.
"They said the checks were good and
could be cashed at any place. I have
worked hard all my life and last Feb
ruary I had thousands of bushels of
wheat on hand. They offered me a
fair price for it and I sold."
His troubles, however, were not yet
at an end. A week ago the parrot dis
appeared. - Yesterday Smith saw his
former wife, birdcage In hand, leaving
the Union Station , with "Al." Smith
seized his parrot /ja& ran. On com
plaint of Mrs. Smi' Ji he was placed un
der bontJs of $300 to keep the peace by
Justice Prlndeville.
As soon as Smith lert the Police
Court he hurried to the City Hall and
secured possession of the parrot.
"You're a good bird, even: if you did
make me - lose my wife/*, said ' Smith.
"Where** Air* asked the bird.

"Mr. Carnegie believes the woman

the case at length. There is nothing in
any of those stories connecting : Mr.

NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â It is probable
that the Hamburg- American line
steamship Pretoria, with Dr. Leroy S.
Chadwick on board, will not reach this
port until to-morrow, or possibly Fri
day. She was due to arrive at New
York to-day. The delay is owing to
the unusually heavy weather reported
by all incoming steamships.
When the Pretoria docks Dr. Chad
wick will be served with a summons in
a suit brought by Herbert D. Newton
of- Boston to recover 590,000 on two

Sxtodal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Dec. "8.â This was a busy
day for the teachers who are here to
attend 'the sessions of the California
Teachers' Association. After the recep
tion at the Vendome last evening they
â¢were all in a happy mood and had be
come better acquainted with each oth
er. The State Normal School, where
the meetings are being held, was
crowded to the doers all day long, and
the registration was very large. The
Elementary School Association and the
High School Teachers' Association met
at 9:30 o'clock this morning, and the
meeting attracted the attention and at
tendance of nearly all the visitors.
The California Teachers' Association
held its first meeting in Normal Hall
this afternoon. A large crowd was
present and many were unable to se
cure seats. Governor Pardee was pres
ent and with Mayor Worswick and oth
er noted citizens and educators occu
pied seats on the platform. All the of
ficers of the State association were
present. They are as follows:
President. Charles L. Biedenbach, Berkeley;
vice pre*idÂ»at. Miss Kate Ames. Napa; vice
president. B. W. Griffith Loe Anseles: secre
tary. Mrs. M. M. FltzGerald. 1627 Folsom
street. Ban Francisco; assistant secretary. Miss
A. G. Kelly. San Francisco: railroad secretary,
A. E. Shumate. San Jose; treasurer. Philip
Prior, San Francisco.
President Charles L. Bledenbach
called the meeting to. order and intro
duced Rev. 8. D. /Huisinpiller of the
First Methodist Church, who offered
an Invocation.
WELCOMED BY MAYOR.
Mayor George D. Worswick delivered
an address of welcome. He said he
was glad to welcome representatives of
Interests of such great;. moment, not
only to the State, but to the nation as
well, and paid a pretty compliment to'
the teachers as build* vs of the charac
ter of men In the high- places and tha
makers of America's greatest men. HÂ«
was proud of the schools of San Jose,
and wished the administration was in a
position to' raise the salaries of the
teachers. The visiting teachers were
asked to make their visit pleasant, and
he hoped they would accomplish much
In their meetings that would redound
to the credit of the commonwealth.
President Charles I* Bledenbach re
sponded on behalf of the teachers and
then delivered his annual address. Tha
progress made by the teachers was re
ferred to, and he attributed this to
clubs. Institutes and associations. HÂ«
said the California Teachers' Associa
tion always stood In the lead in edu
cational works and was making rapid
progress and assuming definite charac
ter. The association is an aggregation
cf associations, each with its own of
ficers and by-laws. This organization,
he said, would have been impossible
ten years ago, and ten years from now
a greater organization was expected.
It was hoped by that time that a per
manent annual meeting place would b*
secured, with a permanent and well
paid secretary in charge, whose duty it
would be to furnish information. He
said this was possible, as there were
10,000 eligible members in the State and
$1 each would furnish the funds, and
the teachers were anxious to pay tho
money for such work. One of the most
Important problems before the associa
tion was that of salary.
All agreed that the teachers wera
underpaid and many had come to be
lieve It- He believed a majority of the
Legislature favored an increase, of tho
pay of , the teachers and certainly the
Governor did. The enly way to pro
cure an increase, he said, lay in an in
crease of the school funds. The sew
text books and course of study -were
referred to and the speaker said there
was an improvement In each. Tho
ethics of teachers were touched upon.
GIVES AI>VICE TO TEACHERS.
P. F. Gosbey, president of tha San
Jose City Board of Education, deliv
ered an address. He Â«poke of the char
acter of teachers and showed how
much depended on them in forming tha
character of their pupils. He referred
to the life of Abraham Lincoln. Teach
ers were advised to tell their pupils oc
casionally of the great men that some
spark of emulation might be kindled In
the heart of the little student. He
spoke of the average school trustee
and the selection of men to rule tho
teachers who had no ideas of the art
of teaching. Teachers were advised
not to undermine one another, but to
live ud to a high code of ethics. Â»
Mr Roberts of Palo Alto rendered a
barytone solo that received much ap
plause.
Governor Pardee was then intro
duced, and spoke In a humorous vein
for some minutes. He said he wished
he could see more gentlemen present,
not that he would take away one lady,
but that he wanted to see more men.
He said that the people of the State
loved the public schools and that the
people were willing to do everything
they could to make them better. The
burning question now was money. He
had dug and toiled to get light* on -.the
vexatious question. His private sec
retary even admitted that more- salary
was due the teachers. He and Super
intendent of State Instruction Kirk had
fousht over and studied the question,
and now they had begun to see some
daylight ahead. He said that if each
pupil in a district was not receiving

In Captured Territory.
.-HUANSHAN. Dec. 28. â Even-thing
continues quiet along the front of the
hostile^ armies. There is little expec
tation "of a decisive movement till
spring, when it will be possible for
both Bides to throw in strong rein
forcements and recommence the cam
paign in earnest. In the meantime
the chief Japanese uneasiness seems
to be with regard to their communica
tions eastward. They have an un
usually full equipment of narrow
gauge field railways, one of which
connects General Kuroki's base at
Shahedzi with Fengwangcheng, with a
branch to Saimatsza also. A supple
mentary line is being constructed,
connecting Liaoyang with Haicheng.
There is an important line of ware-
Jiou^es along the Yalu River and
xnan'y bridges have recently been con
etructed with a care unusual in field
operations. This elaborate system has
been seriously threatened by General
Rennenkampff's raids southeastward.
â¢ There are many evidences that the
Japanese are strengthening and forti
fying their line of communication to

absorb a considerable force.

Two Bold Burglars Secure
Large Sum From Michael

ONE THUG COMES TO
RESCUE. OF PARTNER
Lock Their Victim . tip in a
Closet After Stripping
â¢ Him of All His. Valuables
and Beating Him Brutally
Michael Casey, a saloon-keeper at
1021 Howard street, had an exciting
struggle with two" masked burglars last
night shortly after 11 o'clock! Casey
made a game fight, but was finally
overpowered and robbed' of $196 15 in
coin and a gold watch and chain. The
robbers made good their* escape. ,
The ro"bbery was a daring as well as
a well executed one. Casey was walk
ing up and down inside his saloon, and
while his back was turned a- man wear
ing a black mask stealthily entered
and with a revolver pointed at the head
of the saloon man ordered him to
throw up his hands and keep quiet.
Instead of obeying the command
Casey grappled with the robber. They
struggled on the floor for more than
five minutes and the robber began to
weaken. Casey managed to get hold of
the gun and struck the intruder over
the head and face several times, cut
ting a wide gash on his forehead and
another on his nose.
The robber was about to give in
when his pal scented danger and en
tered the place. In a twinkling he
jumped on Casey and overpowered
him. Then the pair beat' the saloon
man nearly into insensibility and
dragged him into a closet, where they
went through his pockets,, securing
J1S0 in gold, a gold, watch and chain
and ?6 15 in silver. "This done, the
bold pair locked the door on Casey and
repaired to the barroom, where they
broke open the cash register and got
$10 more.
Casey's cries for aid were heard by
a passerby and he was released from
his place of imprisonment after being
locked up for about fifteen minutes. By
.that time the burglars were- many
blocks away and' Casey notified the po
lice at the Central station and detec
tives were put to work. Casey, says
the pair acted like men who under
stood their business and went at their
work in a brisk manner. They had
evidently been watching the place, for
they burst in upon Casey when he was
alone and about to close up for the
night.
HUNGARIAN PARLIAMENT

BUDEPEST, Dec. 28.â rThere was a
disorderly sitting of the Chamber of
Deputies to-day and Premier Tisza was
compelled, owing to stormy protests
from the opposition, to abandon his at
tempt' to induce the House to vote on
the Government's expenditure without
the sanction of Parliament. The Pre
mier then, amid a great uproar, an
nounced the adjournment of the Cham
ber until January 3, saying that the
house at that time would hear the Em
peror's speech dissolving Parliament.
Shouts were raised of " "the King 'is
breaking . his oath," together with de
nunciations of Premier, Tisza as "the
curse of an unfortunate dynasty."

School Director Roncovieri received a

Lahgdon, who is in San Jose attending
the session of % the State Teachers' '. As
sociation, to the effect that the legisla
tive committee is preparing a favorable
report; on a proposed act of the Legis
lature which will reduce the income of
the schools of San Francisco from the
State, by some $300,000 and ultimately
result in reducing the salaries of teach
ers unless the Board > of Supervisors
makes up the deficiency.
â  The proposed act provides for the
payment of $400 by the State to every
teacher in the public school department
of the State. The rest of the income
from the State is based upon the num
ber of pupils in average daily attend
ance) instead of on the school census.
The local Board of Education is up in
arms' at - the proposed legislation, and
Roncovieri at once requested Langdon
to fight the proposition. The committee
stands seven in favor to four against
the .measure, and will not bring it up
before the main body of the associa
tion until Friday. Langdon says that
many of the " San Francisco ; teachers

w anted it , brought up ' to-day (Wednes

"I do not object to fixing the salaries
of teachers throughout : the State at a
proper figure," said Roncovieri,' "but I
do object to it .being done at ; the ex
pense, of the San Francisoo teachers.
The â¢ San Francisco schools now receive
about $i;300,000 yearly from the State

NORTHWESTERN TRAIN
LOST IN STORM IN
WISCONSIN.
May Be Bttriedin Snow Drift
Railway Service of a Wide Section Crippled
as a Result of Great Blizzard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
: MILWAUKEE, . Dec. 28.â Somewhere
alonWt the line of | the Chicago and
Northwestern, Railroad, not many
miles from Madison, a passenger train
is lost. It is overdue thirty hours, the
schedule having called for its arrival
in this city- last evening at 4 o'clock.
Not a word has been heard from it at
this -end -of the line and it has been
impossible to establish communication
since the fierce blizzard put.the tele
graph and telephone wires out of com
mission. 4 v "
The supposition here is that the train
is buried in a snowdrift at some poirft
west of 4 Madison. Whether the passen
gers are stranded has not been ascer
tained, but unless the -train is caught
in, a deep/cut it is likely they have
found their way to a haven, safe from
hunger and exposure.
So severe was the storm over the
State last night that many trains were
abandoned altogether. Conditions are
coming back to normal to-day, but
the destruction of wires has handi
capped the operation of the/lines.
LA CROSSE, \vis., Dec. '28.â A drop
in temperature of forty degrees' fol
lowed the blizzard, which ceased at
midnight. Snow is . drifting to the
height of . eight . and ten feet In the

street railway tracks so traffic can be
resumed.

WHEN FINNIGAN MEETS KEHOE
SPIRITED BOUT IS EXPECTED
Two Olympic Club Men Will Defend
Titles Won ia the Ring at St.
Louis.
Sam Berger and Jim Casey have
completed their training for their
four-round bout to-morrow night in
Mechanics* Pavilion. The "amateurs"
are to fight for a trophy of gold val
ued at about $700. It is from an orig
inal design, guarded jealously by Un
cle Sam and made only in his mints.
The return match between Finnigan
and Kehoe is expected to provide a
spirited fight. Billy Roche will ref
eree the heavyweight and bantam
weight contests, while Milton Hayes
will pass judgment on the other bouts.
From present appearances Jack
Johnson and Marvin Hart will be two
of the best trained- heavyweight box
ers which have stepped into the ring
here in years. Hart has been train
ing at Larkspur for some time, while
Johnson settled down at Oakland as
soon as the articles were signed.
Johnson is anxious to win quickly
from Hart, as he thinks public opin
ion will then force Jeffries into the
ring ,with him. As the champion has
fought Peter Jackson, Bob Armstrong
and Hank Griffin, all colored men,
Johnson thinks it late. in the day for
the champion to draw the color line.
Young Corbett settled down at San
Rafael yesterday to undergo a severe
course of training under the direction
of Frank McDonald. Corbett has no
match in sight, but he wants , to be
ready in case one develops. He wants
to train down until he weighs about
126 pounds: This will require a lot
of work, which he feels will benefit
him.

CONSUMPTION
CAUSES CURED
Over - Feeding Is the Main
Feature of Treatment
Successful in New York
FIFTY EEGAIN HEALTH
Milk, Eggs and Easily Di
gested Fats Given to the
Patients in Abundance
Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK. Dec. 28.â That it is
possible to cure cases of consumption
in the New York tenements has been
demonstrated to a remarkable decree
in the recent records of the Post Grad
uate Hospital at Twentieth street and
Second avenue. The patients who have
been recorded as cured were taken in
hand when the disease was in its Drt
mal stages. They were treated at the
hospital, but were allowed to live at
their homes. They had merely to visit
the hospital for examination and wad
ed nourishment. Their diet was care
fully arranged and their dwellings
were kept perfectly ventilated.
Dr. Roosa, president of the hospital
staff, is enthusiastic over the success
of the system.' lie said to-day: â¢' i
"Out of approximately 250 patients
about fifty have been thoroughly cured
of consumption. â¢ Our treatment is an
exploitation of the theory of overfeed
ing. By overfeeding patients in the
first stages of the disease and watch-
Ing their surroundings at their homes
we believe consumption can bo con
quered.
"Milk, eggs and easily digested fata
are given to the patients in the hos
pitals. There is no restriction as to
other foods, however. We see that
they keep their windows open ! con
stantly. The men may go about their,
work as usual, there being no neces
sity for confinement. Heretofore -we
have treated consumption only from
Its walking stages, and have taken
no cases unless we were sure it was
really consumption with which oa
tlents were afflicted, so we can state
our cures with certainty."

THE VALUE OP CHARCOAL. â¢
Few Peoj.13 Know How Useful It I.* In
Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature,
but few realize Its value when taken
into the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; , it Is^ not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and Impurities always present
In the stomach and Intestines and car-
ries them out cf the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking' or after eating on-
ions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion; it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect In the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All ( druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably tho
best charcoal and the most for tha
money Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozen-
ges; they are composed of the finest
powdered Willow charcoal and other
harmless anttseptlcs In tablet form,
or rather In the form of large, pleas-
ant tasting lozenges, the charcoal bo-
Ing mixed with honey.
\ The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much Improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of it Is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but, oq the contrary,
great benefit'
' A Buffalo physician, In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I adrisa
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe tho liver is
i greatly benefited by the daily usÂ» of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores and although In eomÂ»
sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get- more and better charcoal
in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
any of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

BABE FOR PALTRY SUM.
Mrs.ClapKWoulfl
Sell Child to
Stranger.
Humane Official
Makes Strange
: Discovery.
' 'AthoufSi the days cf slavery passed
irttlx the Binning of the Emancipation
â¢Proclamation forty years ago, there is
at least one -woman in this city -who
hM to far overlooked this fact that
fhÂ« traa -willing to barter a new-born
baj>e for & few paltry dollars. Her
naaie Is Mrs. Emma Clark and she was
jtrrested yesterday afternoon on com
plaint of M- J. White, secretary of the
California Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. The woman
tried to make a bargain with White
â whereby he was U> receive a 3 weeks
eld boy in exchange for $75.
The case Is a strange one. The moth
er of the unfortunate waif is not
known to the authorities, as she kept
tn tfie background while Mrs. Clark
endeavored to make a bargain over the
unfortunate little child.
The story told by White is a realistic
one â as remarkable a tale of human
Irailty as ever came from the lips of a
public official. White, while perusing a
morning paper last Sunday, was at
tracted 2>y an unusual advertisement,
â which said that a healthy baby boy
xnisrnt be adopted by any one calling:
for It at 2106 Bush street.
OFFERS BABE FOR COIN.
. White called at the address last
Tuesday afternoon and was met at the
<Soor by Mrs. Clark. He asked about
the chlJd and the woman casually In
formed him that she was in possession
of a healthy infant whom she was anx
ious to eee placed in the care of some
worthy person. White was anxious to
find out more about the babe and the
woman volunteered him Information
very readily.
She stated the infant was the son of
a young girl of IS who called at her
home several weeks ago and Informed
Mrs. Clark that she was about to be
come a mother. Mrs. Clark said she
took the girl in out of sympathy, paid
her 'doctor's bills and nursed her after
tbÂ«*- child â was born.
The girl left the child In the care of
Â£Xr& Clark and informed her that she
wanted to have nothing more to do
with it. Mrs. Clark said she then ad
vertised for some one to adopt the
.child and when White offered to take
it- and rear It as his own she readily
consented, but In a business way she
told White that she wanted $75 for the
child.
The woman agreed to let White have
the babe and added that there "would
be no questions asked." Apparently all
f^ie* cared about was the money. When
.White disclosed his identity and in
formed the woman that he was a dep
uty health officer, as well as a humane
official. Ehe was taken aback and tried
to make excuse for her actions.
SHELTERS CHILD'S MOTHER,
-Mrs. Clark said she had taken the
mother of the infant In and given her
shelter in her hour of need, paid the
doctor's bill and nursed the infant, and
t&at the money 6he demanded was
merely to satisfy the expenses she had
undergone. She denied emphatically
that she intended to barter the Infant
for a suai of money, but at the same
tfme she refused to part with It unless
she received $75.
White reported the matter to the
Board of Health and yesterday swore
out a warrant charging the woman
with maintaining a maternity hospital
"without a license from the board. The
wonian was arrested yesterday after
noon on this charge, but under the law
ehe cannot be prosecuted for offering
a human being in exchange for a sum
of money.
At the City Prison last night Mrs.
Clark assumed a reticent attitude
â when questioned about the child and
Its parents, but stoutly denied having
tried to dispose of it for money.

ADAMS WANTS
A NEW COUNT
Asks That All the Ballot-
Boxes in Denver Be Gone
Over by Court Officials
DENVER, Dec. 28. â Lawyers Charles
Thomas and Samuel W. Belford filed
a petition in the Supreme Court to
day on behalf of Alva Adams, the Gov
ernor-elect, asking that either the
court or a commission appointed by
the court op^n all of the 204 ballot
boxes used In Denver at the recent
election a.nd make a. thorough exami
nation of their contents.
"I have no doubt as to my election
by substantially the majority reported
on the face of the returns," said Gov
ernor-elect Adams. "But I want no
tainted seat. It is of far greater im
portance that extensive election frauds
should be unearthed and punished
than that I or any other particular in
dividual should be sworn In as Gov
ernor."
The petition insists that however
extensive the frauds perpetrated, the
legal voters have a constitutional rignt
to have their ballots counted. To that
end the court is asked to open every
ballot box in the city of Denver and
scrutinize its contents.
Late this afternoon the Supreme
Court announced its decision not to
grant the application of Michael Bes
hoar, the Democratic candidate for the
State Senate in Las Animas County,
for leave to file an application for. a
writ of mandamus to compel the State
Eoard of Canvassers to canvass the re
turns showing his election and issue
a certificate to him. The decision ap
plies likewise to the contest from
Bculder County, where SenatorCharles
B. Ward, a Democrat, was re-elected
on the face of the returns and the Re
publican attorneys asked the board to
Issue the certificate to the Republican
candidate.
Immediately after the decision was
given the board proceeded with the
canvass behind closed doors in order
to prevent the service of a writ of in
junction restraining: the board from
issuing certificates of election to the
Republican contestants, Ca?imori Ba
rela and H. B. Millard. The deputy
sheriff bearing the injunction read it
through the keyhole. The board
nevertheless granted certificates to
Barela and MlHard.
District Judge Samuel L. Carpenter
and Attorneys Everett Be.ll and John
A. Rush were later served with notices
to appear before the Supreme Court.

WILL ABOLISH
GRAND JURIES
Minnesota Votes to Follow
in the Footsteps â¢ of Wis
consin and North Dakota
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call,
ST. PAUL. Dec. 28.â By a vote of
over 191,000 the constitutional amend
ment directing the Legislature to abol
ish the srand jury system was adopted
in Minnesota. The Wisconsin and
North Dakota courts are working with
out grand juries, and it was the satis
factory state of affairs in these States
that prompted the last Legislature to
r.ubmit the constitutional amendment
to the electors.
Attorneys argue that the grand Jury
has outlived the purposes for which
it was created In England, and should
never have been adopted in this coun
try. The grand jury, it was held, hears
but one side of the case, that of thu
prosecution, and frequently brings in
an indictment on little evidence. Fre
quent "quashings" by the court and
acquittals by trial juries led the Legis
lature to take action.
There will be no change in the trial
procedure, except that the grand jury
will be eliminated. The committing
magistrate will henceforth hold a pre
liminary examination. If the evidence
warrants it the prisoner will be bound
over to th* Circuit Court. The County
Attorney will then file an information
â with tha <x)urt and the case will be
placed on the calendar for trial. The
details will have to be provided by
an action of the Legislature.

/NEW YORK. Dec. 2S.âCommit
ment to Jail on a- charge of murder
in the first degree without bail was
the surprise which greeted Frank Mac-
Laughlin, a patrolman, when he ap
peared in the Criminal Court to-day to
plead to an indictment charging him
with assault upon James P; Robbins,
a newspaper reporter. The new charge
was based upon an indictment' which
District Attorney Jerome said would
be "returned by the Grand Jury to
morrow.
MacLaughlin was once before ar
restod in connection with the killing
of John W. Patterson, a â¢ colored
watchman. The Coroijer's Jury found
that he shot Patterson, in. self-defense
and he was discharged. The District
Attorney was . not . satisfied with that
disposition of the case, however, and
began an Investigation, . which, . he
says, has resulted in- an indictment
charging murder. In. the. first degree.

of the Accused Actress
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.â Xan Patter
son, the former show girl, who is in
the Tombs Prison charged with the
murder of Caesar Young, was in better
spirits to-day than at any time since
the second Jury which heard the tes
timony in her case reported that they
were unable to agree upon a verdict.
She believed, she said, that the freedom
for which she has longed for more than
six months was about to be granted.
Telegrams had come to her from
Wheeling, W. Va., announcing that
four prominent men in that city, were
prepared to furnish bail for her in any
amount up to $50,000. .
Later one of Miss Patterson's counsel
gave out a telegram sent her from
Fairmount, W. Va., offering to "give
bail for her release. It was as follows:
"FAIRMOUNT, . W. Va-, Dec. 23.â
Nan - Patterson, care Tombs Prison,

to the extent of $50,000 if necessary.
"T. A. DEVENEY,

Deveney is a lawyer, Price a mer

to-day. Afterward, it was learned that
both sides desired delay and it seems
probable that Miss Patterson will not
be put ; on trial . again for several
months. â¢ â  '.'.,.. . â  . *
Nan Patterson's father spent part of
the day with his daughter in the Tombs
and said after leaving her he feared
she was going insane. Dr. Maguire
was sent. for later and after examining
Miss Patterson . said:
, Miss -, Patterson is in a highly nerrom.and
even a hysterical "condition, but in my Judg
ment there need not be any fear of Insanity
from present -Indications. She laughs a good
deal, but -the. laughter It of a hysterical
character more than from any impulse that
appears like ' insanity. She needs good care
and constant ' watching and companionship.
The latter, as we. all- know, cannot be. very
well -cupDlled in: a.oriton. . . Â»' . .
FAIRMOUNT. W. Va., Dec. 28.â T.
A. Deveney, one of the wealthiest men
in this city, confirmed the -report to
day that he, H. J. Price and Edward
Stack, also local business : men, would
furnish Nan Patterson with bail to the
extent of â¢ $50,000 If necessary, not In
order I to receive j notoriety," but because
they believe her innocent of the crime
with which she is charged. A telegram

WHISKY KILLS
CHILD OF FIVE
Boy Plied With Liquor
by His Intoxicated
Parents Dies in Agony
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec .28.â The
death of John Clarlr. a five-year-old
boy, who expired last night after ten
hours' unconsciousness, was found at
the Inquest held to-day to have been
due to acute alcoholism. The child was
a son of Eliza Thurston and a stepson
of Sonnle Thurston, who live near Ba
shaws Station.
Thurston came into possession of a
Jug of wine and a quart of whisky, and
yesterday morning he and his wife in
dulged in an after-Christmas celebra
tion. When they reached the stage of
intoxication they plied, the child freely
with liquor. Some time later the boy
was found unconscious. Dr.. Talbott
was called in, but the poison had taken
too deep a hold on the little victim's
system to-be shaken off, and death
finally ensued from convulsions.
The mother told the Coroner that In
giving the child lfquor she thought to
dose him sufficiently to make him have
a distaste for it- After a full investi
gation the Coroner is satisfied there
was no criminal intent and that at the
worst It was a case of ignorance in the
parents, so he will not order a prose
cution. - â¢ -\ 'â ''-:

murdered!" was the startling cry made
by H. B. Klotz of 259 Fourth street
a3 he rushed wildly into the Police
Court this morning. Clerk Hennessey
glanced at his excited calier, but could
discern no evidences of violent death.
In fact, Klotz was anything but dead
as he danced around the clerk's of
fice, pitched to a high key of excite
ment.
"Yes, I've been murdered," - reas
sured Klotz, "and I want a complaint
for murder, battery and disturbing the
peace. He pointed a pistol at me."
Hennessey managed to quiet his
visitor long enough to learn that Klotz
had had a business dispute with Frank
Varrup of 637 Madison street. Prose
cuting Attorney Leach compromised
the murder charge- by issuing a war
rent for Varrup'a arrest for disturb
ing the peace.

AND ROBS HER
Thug Makes a Brutal Attack
on Pedestrian He Waylays
at a Dark* Street Corner
Berkeley Office Ban Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Dec 28.
Mrs. Beatrice Willmans of 2614 Haste
street was attacked Uast night by a
footpad, who struck his victim on the
head with a blunt instrument The
brutal robber grabbed a handbag con
taining a purse and money that Mrs.
Willmans was carrying and fled..
The woman was half senseless from
the blow for a few minutes, but when
she came to her senses she screamed
for help. Neighbors hastened to assist
Mrs. Willmans and they escorted her
to her residence, which is near the
scene of the robbery.
The attack occurred shortly after 8
o'clock. Mrs. Willmans had ridden to
Haste street and College avenue on an
electric car and was hastening home
when the highwayman met her. The
place he selected was well adapted for
the crime. It is shaded by trees and a
large hedge, the latter surrounding the
William L. Duff residence at the corner
of College avenue and .Haste street-
Mrs. Willmans did not see the face of
her assailant 'owing to the darkness.
The robber struck Mrs. Willmans
twice. The first blow glanced off her
shoulder, but the secona one, square
on the side of the head, staggered her.
She felt her handbag wrenched from
her grasp as she sank to the sidewalk.
The injury caused such a shock that
the footpad's victim was prostrated to
day and. could not talk about the oc-.
currerice. She expressed gratification
that the thug had not more seriously
hurt her.
Mrs. Willmans was unable to give the
police a description of her assailant.

According to Professor Twight, the
prices of grapes are already as low as
they well can be, and profits on wines

waa halted before the West Oakland HomÂ» and
Its burden transferred to the larders of the
orphanage with the Elks' best wishes for a
happy Christmas. It was- a generous gift. In
deed, but then our Elks never do anything by
halves. To-night a Christmas tree will delight
the little ones at the home. It was decorated
by Mrs. Charles Heeseman and Mrs. W. H. J.
Matthews, wives of two prominent Elks, who
took up a collection a few days ago wim whlcb
to purchase toy3 and otherwise provide, m. real
Christmas for the children.

of Mr. and Mrs. J. Walter Scott last week.
Juat a half dozen friends were invited to din
ner.- and then later . were witnesses to the
ceremony in which the host and hostess re
newed their marital vows. But the ceremony
was very different from the solemn one of
twenty-two years ago! Time has passed very
lightly over this Jolly couple, and one can
scarcely believe that they have enjoyed eo
many anniversaries. â  ;" ... :;
A big tin bell hung in one corner of the
drawing-room and under this Dr. Mehr
mannâ great beaming giant, in long coat and
the smallest book procurable â waited with
the groom. Little Adele Scott, bearing an
enormous cushion on which reposed an equally
enormous ring, led the bridal procession. E.
B. Davis was a most fascinating "maid" of
honor, and Dr. .'Porter save the bride away.
The risibilities of the guests had already- been
taxed, but when they caught sight of the
bride they were simply overcome. The eleeves
of her gown were short and so were the white
cotton gloves. The shower bouquet was com
posed of long etranda of ribbon with the flow
ers sewed on here and there, , 'and over all fell
a lace curtain veil. .As the showbilla say it
was "screamingly funny," and no one enjoyed
it more than Mr. and Mrs. Scott. May an
other twenty years find them as light of heart
and the same happy | pair they are to-day

PROPOUNDS NEW THEORY
OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT
Dr. Spitzka Says Not Gray Matter bnt
Health of Bundle of Fibers
Shows Mentality.
PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 28. â A new
theory of brain development haa been.
propounded by Dr. Edward Anthony
Spitzka of Columbia University before
the Association of Anatomists at the
University of Pennsylvania. It is in
effect that mentality 13 not dependent
on the relative proportion of white
and gray matter so much as upon th-*
health of the great bundle of fibers
known as the corpus callosum, -which
connect the two sides of the brain.
In announcing his theory Dr. Spitzka
exhibited .the* brains of more than *
dozen men who had been eminent in
science- and in each case endeavored
to show that they bore out his asser
tion. Said he: ,
The . relative importance of *thÂ« white and
rray matter In the brain la oftfh misconstrued.
Were it not for the manifold connections cf
the nerve cells In the cortex 'with each other
as well as with the periphery by means of thÂ»
millions and millions of fibers which make up
the white matter, such a brain would be a*
useless as a multitude cf telephone or telegraph
stations with all interconnecting wire* de
stroyed. . '
The corpus callosum Is an Index which place*
the brain of man so far over that of the brute.
"When this structure i? deficient or diseased It
is Invariably attended by profound weak mind
edness cr total idiocy. Ana the examination
of the brains of these notable men possessing
large capacity for doing and thinking showÂ»
the converse to be quite aÂ» true. .' .....
He ridiculed the idea that the crimi
nal brain was of a type distinct from
that of the ordinary person. He main
tained that the classification of crimi
nals must rest upon the observation of
each individual criminal, together with
his antecedent history. Speaking of
the brains of the various races. Dr.
Spitzka said eventually the bigger and
better brains will be found on thÂ«
American continent, because nowher*
in the world Is the mixture of the races,
chletly Teutonic. Celtic-Roman and Sla
vonic, going on so actively as here.

HEAR MITCHELL
Senior Senator From Oregon
Gives His â  Testimony in
Land Fraud Investigation
XEKVQUS AXD W0HB1ED
t >
Congressman Binger Her
mann Also Summoned Be
fore the Inquisitorial Body
. PORTLAND. Dec 28.â Bent with
"bis more than three-score years and
ten, and leaning up on the arm of his
law partner, the vhite-halred senior
S.eniitor froni Oregon, John H. Mitch
ell, who for the better part of a quar
ter of a century has represented his
State In the Federal Congress, to-day
vent Into the Government's Inauislto
rial chamber to tell what he know con
cerning frauds which the Government
he has served so long believes have
been perpetrated upon it in the acaui
sition of its public lands.
Tired and careworn he came from
the Jury room at the noon hour, only
to return in the afternoon. Later, when
the Senator left the courthouse. z.v
'parently nervous and worried, it was
stated that the investigation, so far as
'Mitchell was concerned, had ended.
â¢What transpired in that chamber is
.unknown further than that Mitchell
went into it with no more favor than
would have been extended the hum
blest citizen of his country. Neither
his request that he be confronted with
any testimony that the Government
may have found to his detriment nor
that he be furnished with the names
of his alleged accusers was era n ted.
.Whether he v.as allowed to make any
exculpatory statement is not known.
The Jury is sworn to secrecy, Messrs.
Heney and Hall, the Government's at
torneys, refusing to make any staie
"ment whatever of what transpired,
â¢and Mitchell, the only other person
â¢who knows, went directly to his apart
ments in the Hotel Portland and re
fused absolutely to receive callers.
The rest of the afternoon with the
jurors might have been a session of
Congress for all the effect it appeared
to have upon Congressman Binder
'Hermann. He appeared shortly after
2- o'clock in the afternoon and went
into seclusion in the inner office of the
District Attorney after he had erected
a' few acquaintances in the outer of
fices and the halL "When called to the
j\iry room he shook hands with those
v.hom he knew in the corridor and
patted Attorney Heney heartily on
the back. When the session had closed
for- the day Mr. Hermann remained in
the jury room for some time, convers
ing with Heney and the Jurors, among
w-hbm he found several whom Me had
known in various parts of the State.
. The time of the jury will be taken
UP by Hermann for the greater part
oi th*> forenoon to-morrow, but it is
thought that he will have told his
story by the noon adjournment.
The Government, so far as is
Known,- did not recede from its stand
â¢announced yesterday to the effect
that it vould neither make known Its
brUaeasea to Senator Mitchell and Her
mann nor tell them aucht of the case.
. In fact it is not thought that the
testimony of Mitchell and Hermann in
their alleged connection with the land
frauds has as yet been taken up by
ti-Â«Â»: Jury specifically. It is supposed
that a great deal of w"hat has been
t<jld the jurors by many of the wit
nesses who have been examined prior
to this time has had an indirect bear
ing on the case. It is thought that
Senator Mitchell and Hermann were
given this opportunity to give their
testimony and answer any questions
which might be asked by the jury be
fore the case itself has been brought
before it in order to enable the Con
pressmen to return to Washington In
time for the reconvening of Congress.
Some, of the men indicted on Tuesday
afternoon have appeared and will give
the $4000 bonds fixed by the court. S.
TJ.-'Ormsby of Salem was given five
days in which to enter his plea, and
was also allowed one day to secure
ball. In the meantime he was released
on his own recognizance. C. E. Loomis
of- Eugene gave his bond as required.
â  Mayor W. H. Darts of Albany did not
reach the city to-day, as expected. He
will probably arrive in Portland to
morrow, when he will give his bond.
George Sorenson is reported to have
returned to Portland to-day, but has
net as yet made his appearance.

LARGE DREDGER
The Mastodon, Owned by San

Levee East of Antioch
CREW MAKE GOOD FIGHT
Flames Break Out in Oil
Tanks and in Short Time
Envelop Entire Structure
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANTIOCH, Dec. 2S.â The large dredg
er Mastodon, belonging to the Bay and
River Dredging Company, was burned
this afternoon. The dredger had been
doing reclamation work on the Walker
levee, east of Antioch. This morning
the crew took on 10,800 gallons of fuel
oil, and shortly afterward the Japanese
cook reported that there was a fire un
der the oil tanks on the forward part
of the dredger. The crew of eight men
at once gave battle to the fire and man
aged to smother the flames for a short
time. The fire then broke out In the
hold of the dredger and the men were
compelled to abandon the fight. As the
dredger was at work In shallow water
the crew could not scuttle It. The
dredger was insured for about $20,000.
All that was saved from destruction
was the immense bucket, which fell on
the levee when the wooden boom
burned away. The crew lost nearly all
their belongings, and consider them
selves lucky that they escaped from
the flood of burning oil.
Captain Sandy, who had supervision
of the work, was In San Francisco at
the time of the fire. The dredger had
been at work since -midnight Tuesday
night, and only stopped long enough to
receive the supply of oil.
W. H. Wright, the principal owner,
was offered ?60,000 for the dredger a
short time ago. It was built about four
years ago and had been a profitable in
vestment.

Mrs. A- J. Vallade, who conducts a

PROBING DEEP
IN DODGE CASE
Jerome Anxious to Get at
the Bottom of the New
York Matrimonial Muddle
DETECTIVE I IS MISSING
BelieveU That He Can Throw
Further* Light on Identity
of the Others Implicated
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.â The statement
made to District Attorney Jerome by
Charles F. Dodge in connection with
the Morse-Dodge case was not present
ed to the Grand Jury to-day, and it is
understood to-night that all action in
the. case will be deferred until next
week, and perhaps longer. The Grand
Jury will be sworn in next Tuesday,
and it is expected the case will go be
fore it. - - ; ' â 
The District Attornev had and still
has strong hopes of securing all the
evidence needed, but is said to be hav-,
ing difficulty in obtaining witnesses to
corroborate Dodge's statement. Edward
J. Bracken, the detective who is alleged
to have been with Dodge in Texas, has
not yet been located. Jerome's detec
tives are said to be searching for him.
The first official move by District At
torney Jerome to uncover the conspir
acy and lawlessness which he believes
lie back of the long legal fight in the
Dodge-Morse case v/as made to-day,
when he swore out an attachment for
Edward J. Bracken, a detective. Brack
en, it is alleged, was with Dodge in
New Orleans and accompanied him to
Texas.
At the time the divorce of Mrs.
Clemence Dodge was first questioned
by her former husband, who alleged
that he had never been properly served
with papers in the proceedings, the le
gality of Mrs. Dodge's marriage to
Charles W. Morse was placed in ques
tion by the courts, and the tangle that
resulted has never been straightened
out. Dodge's confession is said to im
plicate other persons in a conspiracy to
keep him away from this State, where
he was wanted to answer a charge that
he had committed perjury in swearing
that he was, not properly served with
the divorce papers. Proceedings against
prominent lawyers before the law asso
ciation have been reported to be part
of the District Attorney's programme.
The great mystery of the affair has
been the fact that Dodge, himself a
poor man, was plentifully supplied with
money while he fought extradition from
Texas. Bracken, it is alleged, was with
him much of the time and is believed
to know where the funds came from.
Mr. and Mrs. Morse are in Europe,
but have announced their Intention to
return soon. Dodge, who is at a hotel
in this city, Is in bad health and was
said to-day to be on the verge of col
lapse.
CIGAR DEALERS
ARE INTERESTED
View With Concern Corpora
tion That Has Filed Ar
ticles at Capital of State
Special Dtanatchto The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 28.â Articles of
Incorporation were filed to-di.v with
the Secretary of State by the United
Cigar Stores Company, whose principal
place of business is given as Jersey
City, N. J.
Although the articles do not so state,
local dealers in cigars declare that the
new incorporation is a branch of the
Tobacco Trust. The object of the in
corporation, as set forth in the arti
cles, Is to buy, lease, acquire, establish
and maintain, or sell or otherwise deal
or traffic In cigar stores, shops and
stands; to deal in all kinds of tobacco
and pipes and smokers' articles; to
build and maintain shops and factories
and warehouses; to deliver tobacco in
all forms; to hold or dispose of trade
marks, patents or designs; to acquire
by purchase or otherwise stocks or
bonds; to aid arty corporation. The
corporation is authorized to issue a
capital stock of $2,000,000. The amount
of capital stock with which the cor
poration begins business Is $2500. The
lncorporators of the company are
Charles Levy, Newark, N. J.; Millard
H. Ellison, New York, and Sol M.
Stroock, New York. â¢
D. A. Lindley of the large wholesale
firm of Lindley & Co. said in an inter
view to-day that he believed the new
corporation is related to the American
Tobacco Company, which recently ab
sorbed the Continental Tobacco Com
pany. .He said the new company has
incorporated in many other States and
that its plan is either to buy up or
lease favorite cigar stand corners In
cities and place on sale lines of cigars
carried by the affiliated companies.
Lindley said most small retail dealers
carry their own lines of cigars and the
trust has often found it necessary to
acquire the stores themselves in order,
to control the character of the product
i sold there.

VESSEL STILL
AT SEA'S MERCY
Steamship Drumelzier-Beat
en About by Waves and No
Word Received From Crew
WRECKER'" STANDS NEAR
Life-Savers Ready to Go Out
to Give Aid to British
Ship at the Break of Day
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.â Still pounding
on the bar off Oak Island, where she
struck oiÂ» Christmas morning, there is
practically no change to-day In the
condition of the steamship Drumelzier.
To-night word was sent to the Sandy
Hook life-saving station to get ready
to start for the wreck at daylight.
Captain T. Patterson will have charge
of the crew of eight men, the hardiest
life-savers along the coast- The long
est lifeboat was made ready at once
and early in the morning will be taken
in tow by a powerful tug to where the
British tramp lies stranded.
The vessel lies about three-quarters
of a mile off the extreme end of Fire
Island beach. She is almost in the
channel leading from the ocean into
Great South Bay. All communication
between Oak Island and the mainland
is cut off by the ice that fills this bay
with drifting floes, driven hither and
thither with the winds and in some
places piled in huge hummocks.
The. position of the boat is one of
great peril. She Is lying bow on toward
the shore, with her stern resting on
the bar, showing about two feet above
her normal draft. As she lies the seas
are breaking over her port side, but
the westerly wind which came up to
night showed a tendency to beat down
the high running surf.
At 9 o'clock the wrecking steamship
Merritt was anchored about a mile
from the stranded vessel and the Mer
ntt's surfboat could be s^en lying
alongside the Drumelzier. Whether she
had taken off any of the steamship's
crew or whether she was standing by
as a precaution in case the vessel went
to pieces could not be determined from
shore.
During the day the steamship hoisted
no signals of distress nor did she even
use her whistle, although smoke and
steam from her funnels indicated that
the fires were still going.
UNKNOWN SHIP ASHORE.
Vessel Helpless in Rough Sea Off Cape
Hatteras.
NORFOLK, Va., Dec. 28.â Battered
by Jieavy seas that have been lashed
to fury by a forty-mile gale, an un
known steamship is helpless on the
inner Diamond Shoals, eight miles off
Cape Hatteras, to-nighi and faint
lights seen now and then carry a mes
sage to the life-saving corps on shore
that there are human lives aboard the
wrecked craft that cannot be saved
until the wind and sea have calmed
sufficiently to allow the surfboats to
be launched.
The observer of the United States
Weather Bureau at Hatteras first saw
the steamship when the fog lifted
shortly before noon, to-day. At that
time she appeared to be in distress,
and . later it was seen that she had
giounded on the Inner shoal, known to
mariners as "Hell's Hole." The heavy
seas careened the vessel on her beam
end and at 3 o'clock this afternoon she
was lying on her port side with seas
washing all over her.
SUIT INJURES
NEVADA CITY
Litigation Between Mining
Corporations Throws Many
Men Out of Employment
Special DisDatch to ThÂ« Call
GRASS VALLEY, Dec. 28.â The.Home
Mining Company entered suit this aft
ernoon ( against the Champion Mining
Company asking damages in the sum
of $200,000. The attorneys for the Home
Company have levied an attachment
upon the property of the Champion and
have, been granted an injunction pro
hibiting the company from working the
territory in dispute. One hundred and
ten men were employed at the mine,
and all of these are thrown out of em
ployment as a result of the injunction
order. ;âr
The Home Mining Company was re
cently enjoined from working In the
territory claimed by both companies,
and as a result the mining industry in
Nevada City is practically dead, as
these mines were the backbone of the
town. The contention between the two
companies is almost identical with the
famous Pennsylvania- W. Y. O. D. case,
which dragged out its weary length in
the United States District Court and
which finally resulted in a decision be
ing given the Pennsylvania Company."

o'clock and lying at the bottom of the
Willamette at 6 o'clock Is the fate of
an unidentified man, who went down
with 400 tons of coal from . the coal
barge Monarch early this evening. The
victim of the accident had been em
ployed so short a time that his name
had not been learned by the foreman.
. The barge was moored to the side of
the steamship Arabia, lying at a dock
in the - lower harbor. Waves from a
passing steamer started the barge to
rocking, and In a moment it turned
turtle. Five men were thrown into
the water, but managed to keep clear
of the coal and were rescued by the
crew of the Arabia. The unidentified vic
tim was caught by the falling 'coal and
carried down. The barge, after cap
sizing, remained on the surface. The
water where the accident occurred is
more than fifty feet deep.

FOUR WINNERS PILOTED TO VICTORY AT EMERYVILLE TRACK
BEING A NEW SEASON'S RACE RECORD BY JOKEY WILLIE DAVIS
FINISHES SECOND ON TWO HORSES
Ananias Loses to
Letola by Scant
Head. &
Albert Fir Beats
the Favorite
.Silverskin,
BY FRED E. MCMOLLAXD.
. W. Davis hung up a record for the
season yesterday at Oakland track
that I will keep the other riders busy
for a week or bo at least trying to
lowÂ»r. He finished first in turn on
M. A. Powell, Albert Fir. Augie and
Scherzo and with Mansard and Anan
iaji only lost by narrow margins at
the wire. Willie Harris' lightweight
had a great chance to make It six
â¢straight and with a bit more of racing
luck would have done so. But two
Of his winning mounts were favorites
In the ring. After his early successes
the big crowd unlimbered on Man
sard and Ananias, but the youngster
t;ould not put the last two over, for
tunately for the bookmakers.
While the track was not Lightning
fast, it ' answered all purposes and
some fast time was exhibited. Three
faces fell to favorites.
"Davis began by reaching home first
on M. A. Powell, backed from 7 to
L down to evens in the betting on the
opening- six and a half furlong selling
number for two-year-olds. The colt
jumped away in the lead and won as
he pleased five lengths before Baker
and Alone. The Gadfly had an uneven
voyage, finishing back In the ruck.
ALBERT FIR A WINNER.
""Next followed a higher class two
jear-old event, decided over the Fu
turity .course. Albert Fir was highly
Routed on his morning workouts and
"as Davis was slated to do the riding
the colt's price was hammered down
'from threes to 2 to 1 favoritism. Silver
jEkfn, which opened favorite, receded to
Tl to o. At the last moment the coin
â¢< ame in on the latter and he again en
â¢y.ved the call. Bilverskin was outfoot
ed the first part, and Albert Fir soon
Fhowed in front. Bonner, astride the
favorite, had to take the worst of the
coins on the Inside, and in the stretch
.was unlucky enough to lose a stirrup.
T.'nder theee adverse conditions the
tray ran a splendid race, Albert Fir
beating him but a neck. Bob Ragon
errived at the wire in time to linish
tfiird. â¢
Mr. Farnum possibly looked best of
the cheap assortment of platers start
ing in the mile selling run. The Wll
*on entry ruled favorite and never
looked to have a chance. Augie, sec
ond choice in the betting, received ex
cellent' handling at the hands of Davis
and easily disposed of "War Times
through the stretch. Cinnabar, a
backed one, took the show.
DAVIS' FOURTH VICTORY.
The fourth straight victory of Davis
was scored in the mile and a furlong
eelling -fixture on Scherzo, an 11 to 5
tavorite. He took the Crescendo colt
out in front at the start and, always
having a trifle in reserve, breezed in a
<-ouple â¢ of lengths ahead of Barrack.
IVenrick finished third.
Then Davis stubbed his toe, for in
the six furlong purse number, with the
mount On Mansard, the second choice,
he- was' defeated by Travers astride
Venator. Xnapp cut out the early
running- .with Iridius, the favorite,
Davis waiting with Mansard. Iridius
*ir*d and was cut off a furlong from
the stand, and it looked as if Mansard
wrjuld -win, for he was a head to the
Â£oed at the paddock. Travers, how
jevf'r, appkared at his best on Venator
and as Mansard swerved near the end
.landed Dr. Rowell's sprinter first by a
n.eck.;
Walter Jennings' fleet filly Letola
had- the call over Johnny Schorr's An
pn'iaÂ« for the final seven furlongs purse
run,, and she lowered the colt's colors.
Letola did not break any too fast from
the barrier,, but "Big Bill" Knapp soon
had. her in front. Ananias was at her
heets". bet Davis had to take the worst
of the .going and in a scorching finish
the favorite reached the wire first by a
head. Squire Johnson ran a close third.
â¢ TRACK NOTES.
''Kansas" Price purchased The Gad

had finished unplaced in the first event.

by -two-year-olds from the stable of

gocrtl Charley Lusk will soon be in Sam

"NO SABE,"
SAYS CHEUNG
Chinese Refuses to Tell of
Police Corruption and He
Is Charged With Murder
Chan Cheung, the Chinese merchant
who was spirited from his home Mon
day night by two grand Jurors, was
Indicted yesterday morning on a" charge
of procuring, aiding and abetting the
murder of Tom Ylck In Ross alley on
May 8, 1903. Nine Chinamen are now
in prison accused of participating in
the homicide, one being sentenced to
be hanged and the others awaiting
trial. During the trlalof the second
case taken up charges were made that
a lawyer, E. W. Gunther, had attempt
ed to bribe a juror.
Tom Yick was a member of the so
called "educational society," and ac
cording to the confessions of three
Chinamen now awaiting trial Chan
Cheung was one of those who offered
the reward for his life. The testimony
adduced before the Grand Jury is to
the effect that Chan Cheung was in
strumental In having Tom Ylck killed
by hired assassins.
The jurors were moved to indict Chan
Cheung, however, in the hope that he
would be frightened into revealing his
knowledge of police corruption in
"We took Chan Cheung from his
home and kept him In a room at the
Occidental Hotel till this morning, hop
ing that the threat of Indictment for
murder would frighten him into laying
bare the conspiracy of corruption In
Chinatown," said Foreman Andrews
last night. "But he was too wily for
us and did not give up a bit of evi
dence. He appeared to be more loyal
to the people with whom he dealt in
disbursing moneys for protection of
the gambling games than afraid of an
indictment for murder. Had he talked
he could have given us some .sensa
tional matter, I am sure. Matters are
now In statuquo and the police com
mittee may not meet again till the full
Grand Jury has had Its session to
morrow. We still have good leads for
investigations and there Is no telling
what is going to happen.
"Yes, I think that Sergeant Ellis and
Policemen Heinz and O'Brien are en
titled to a measure of sympathy."
Heinz and O'Brien explain that the
money they accepted from agents of
the gambling games In Chinatown was
as a gift and not for purposes of cor
ruption. The Chinese simply offered
them the cash . as presents, asked no
favors and received none.

lionaire, Led Into Lodging-
House on Kearny Street
Edward Rldeout, son of N. D. Rlde
out, banker and vice president of the
Sperry Flour Company, was the victim
of a footpad early yesterday morning.
The footpad, J. L. Carr, was arrested
by Policeman Nelson and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of robbery.
Hideout was in full dress and had
been dining, not wisely but too
well. About 5 o'clock Nelson saw Carr
leading Rideout along Kearny street,
and suspecting that something â¢ was
wrong he followed them-. They went
into a. lodging-house at 624 Kearny
street, and Carr led Rideout to the sec
ond floor, where he struck him a vio
lent blow on the face, knocking him
unconscious.
Carr was rifling Rideoufs pockets,
which he had turned inside out, when
Nelson's approaching footsteps made
him desist. Carr ran to the rear of the
hall, and Nelson after a search found
him hiding In a lavatory.
Nelson took Carr to the City Prison,
and when searched two bunches of
skeleton keys, a small file and a num
ber of cartridges were found in his
pockets. Some papers with "Wells,
Fargo & Co." on them were also in his
pockets. He put them in his mouth and
tried unsuccessfully to swallow them.
The police believe he is from Seattle
or Walla Walla, Wash. Every effort Is
being made to ascertain where he
lodges. A charge of robbery was reg
istered against him.

YOUNG CIVIL ENGINEER
ASPHYXIATES HIMSELF
W. C. Seidell Ends Life, but Leaves
Xo Clew as to Cause of
His Act.
A mystery lies behind the suicide
Tuesday night of W. C. Seidell, a civil
engineer, believed to be about 30 years
of age. Young Seidell asphyxiated
himself at 532 Ellis street, but for
what cause is not apparent. He left
nothing that would give a clew to the
cause of his desire to die and the po
lice must wait for a solution of the
mystery until they hear from Mrs. C.
C. Miller of Peterboro, N. Y... to
whom, it is believed, the young man
wrote two letters just before launch
ing himself into eternity.
A bunch of keys, on the tag of
which was the suicide's name and the
inscription, "Cornell, '03, Civil En
gineer," leads the police to believe
that the young man was well con
nected, but" this Is merely conjectural.
He rented the room in which he com
mitted suicide last November. He
never held conversation with the land
lady, Mrs. Eva Murphy, and she knew
nothing of him, save that his habits
were strange. He never went to bed
before 4 a. m., she said, and so far as
she could learn passed the hours of
darkness in the study of his profes
sion, reading and smoking. He gen
erally arose about 2 p. m. and left the
house. He returned early in the even
ing as a rule, had no company and
was not known to drink.
When his body was found it was
also discovered that he had burned
every document that would give a
clew to his family connections. A
blotter bearing the impresion of the
addresses on two letters he had evi
dently forwarded to Mrs. Miller was
the only evidence he left behind of
friends or relatives, and on this the
authorities are depending in their in
vestigation.

Alexander M. Lochwitzky, late of the
Russian army. He explained to the

as the Russians looked upon him as a
Japanese spy, and he declared that
the Russian Consul had spies watch
ing his every movement The permit
was granted.
Lochwitzky called yesterday and
received his permit. He said he had
been Invited to lecture at Vallejo, but
when he found that the crew of the
Russian cruiser Lena was there he de
clined the invitation. "It would be
easy to sandbag me," he said, "and
send me back to life In a dungeon."

the island of Saghalien without trial.

noon and by 2 o'clock was steaming
down, the harbor, bound for the Orient,
'jier decks crowded with passengers and
tarrying one of. the largest cargoes ever
laken out of this port. The Mongolia's
sailing hour was 1 o'clock. The tide at
tiXfeT-Mail dock was low, and as the
Â£iant liner was drawing thirty-three
â¢fpfet .of wa-ter it was deemed safer to
use tuÂ£s in getting her away from the
'wharf than to trust to her own pro-
The tugs Sea King. Sea Rover and
.Arabs- did the dragging, and slow work
: it-: proved, as the liner was most re
iiictaut to leave her bed of ooze. Gen-
VÂ»ral Manager R. P. Schwerin put in the
"â¢:jÂ«ie instructing captain and pilot In a
. i.?w of rhe rudiments of seamanship.
His. Imperial Highness Prince Sada

mere nearly 20,000 tons of it. Holds were
packed to the hatches, and even the
upper deck aft was piled high with
stores for which there was no room be
low. The cargo included pig Iron, pig
lead, cotton, leather, steel, machinery,

POOR MEN DIE
IN EXPLOSION
Four Boilers in a Sawmill
in Washington Burst Erom
Some Cause Not Yet Known
BUILDING IS WRECKED
Inspector of an Insurance
Company Recently Certified
to Soundness of Plant
CHEHAL.I3, Wash., Dec. 28. â Three
men were killed and two injured to
day, onÂ© bo badly that he died soon
afterward, by an explosion of four
boilers at the sawmill plant of Wal
worth & Neville at Walville, Wash.
The explosion occurred Immediately
after the mill started for the afternoon
run. The dead:
E. C. HICKS, single, 35 years old;
has relatives in West Virginia.
FRANK DOWELL. 38 years old,
married, of Walville.
PRES EPLING, single, 26 years old,
Walville.
Injured: â 
ROY HICKS, single. 26 years old;
relatives at Decatur, Mich.; died soon
afterward.
W. Buchanan, 22 years old, single,
was probably fatally injured.
The cause of the explosion is un
known. The mill plant had been shut
down for repairs and only sufficient
steam was kept up to run the cross
arm factory. The boilers were in
spected by the official inspector of an
Insurance company not more than ten
days ago and were then pronounced
in good condition. When the mill is
running 100 men are employed. The
fact that the mill proper was not in
operation accounts for the small num
ber of killed.
The mill was badly wrecked.

SAYS "BOUTON"
IS TALL MAN
Police Chief of Salt Lake
Tells of Companion of
Cutler Mountain Victim
KNOWN AS A GAMBLER
Colorado Officers Seeking
Further Facts Before
They Take Up the Search
OQDEN. Utah, Dec 28.â In connec
tion with the Cutler Mountain murder
mystery the statement made tp-day by
Chief of Police Lynch of Salt Lake
City, who is In Ogden on business, Is
interesting. Chief Lynch stated that
he remembered distinctly a Mr. and
Mrs. Bouton, who visited Salt Lake
City last August. The man, he said,
was there to take some sort of medical
treatment, and while in tfie city took
occasion to visit a gambling house,
where he lost a big sum of money.
â¢His loss caused him to apply to the
chief for redress and the proprietors
of the house were forced to refund the
money on pain of punishment.
The man was accompanied by the
woman he called his wife, who answers
minutely the description of the one
murdered. Bouton, says the chief, was
tall and more like the man described
in the dispatch. '
COLORADO SPRINGS, Dec. 28.â
AVhat was depended pn as one of the
strongest sources of Information In re
gard to Mrs. Bessie Bouton, the sup
posed victim of the Cutler Mountain
tragedy, resulted this morning in a
setback to the iavestlgation wben a
telegram was received from New York,
purporting to come from the J- Parker
Pray Chemical Manufacturing Com
pany, for whom Mrs. Bouton claimed
to be a traveling representative, stat
ing that this firm had no such agent
on the road. \
Chief of Police Reynolds is not satis
fied with this telegram, however, and
has wired to New York again, asking
for further particulars as to the move
ments of Mrs. Bouton, basing his re
peated inquiry (jn the fact that Mrs.
Anna Bethman, a local hairdresser, or
dered goods through Mrs. Bouton from
this /firm and received the goods.
It is believed that the message of
inquiry became mixed up In transmis
sion and the police are still confident
that they are on the track of the wo
man who was murdered on Cutler
Mountain.
Other inquiries were sent out to-day
to Syracuse to the relatives of Mrs.
Bouton, seeking to ascertain the name
of the dentist who performed the work
on the teeth of Mrs. Bouton. On the
receipt of his address he will be sent
for to inspect the work done in the
mouth of the woman whose body waa
found December 17, it being fully be
lieved that an opinion by the dentist
who performed the work on Mrs. Bou
tcn's mouth will be conclusive as to
whether or not she and the murdered
woman were identical.
With this point established to the
satisfaction of the officers a systematic
search for the men who have been con
nected with Mrs. Bouton in the facts
that have come to the knowledge of
the police will be instituted.

THE RUSSIAN REFORMS.
THE text of the Czar's answer to the demand for a more repre
sentative government is a declaration of the divinely appointed
. autocracy. It characterizes as seditious the movement for
â¢habeas corpus and the right of free discussion of public policies, and
informs the empire that the government will remain upon its present
foundations. The press is instructed in this document to attend to
its Suty of informing the people that the reforms demanded are un
necessary if not treasonable, and the press immediately proceeded
to do as it was ordered. The Czar, refusing what was asked, pro
ceeded to do what was not demanded, by raising the peasants, the
late serfs, a step in the scale, by putting them on an equality
with the rest of his subjects. The Russian press seizes upon this act
of grace and mercy as deserving the most enthusiastic commenda
tion and the Czar is thanked and flattered for it.
' * The outside observer, accustomed to representative institutions
; and to the judicial safeguarding of the rights of person and prop
erty, sees no reform at all in this elevation of the peasants to an
equality as subjects with the classes among which there exists the
keenest discontent with the rule of Russia by a family of Grand
Dukes,' headed by the Czar. Anarchy, nihilism and sedition have
never been among the peasants. They have not known enough to
be discontented with their lot, no matter how hard it was. Held
in the strong bonds of ignorance and superstitiQn, they have lpolred
upon the Czar as almost a supernatural personage, and, if they have
thought at all, have wondered at the sinfulness of the students, boy
ards and professors who have plotted and planned and murdered
to overthrow the autocracy. The relief granted by the Czar does not
change at all the political situation of Russia. It does not mitigate
nor soften the rule of the Grand Dukes, nor lift a feather's weight
of the load that is imposed upon the freedom of thought and action
in that empire.
The demands of intelligent Russia have been refused, and un
intelligent Russia has, perhaps, been put in the way of some time
sympathizing with those demands, provided this grant to it permits
the mental improvement of the individuals composing it. The
Grand Dukes seem to have merely put off the day of reckoning by
providing that the score will be longer when settlement comes. The.
refusal of participation in the government by the intelligent Russian
people is a flashlight that for an instant reveals the condition of the
empire. It is farther back than England was before Magna Charta.
It is where it was when Peter the Great whipped his own s(jn to
death and Paul murdered his heir.
It is true that the grant of representation in the English govern
ment, first to the Barons and finally to the people, did not at once
produce wisdom and protect liberty, but its effect. was the progress
ive elevation of all the people. The excuse for denying representa
tion- in their government to the people of Russia is that they would
riot use it wisely. But how are they to learn wisdom of a use that
is forever denied to them? England was wiser than that, and her
-people, threading through mam- mistakes, some crimes and disorders,
have stiH been in the lead in Europe and have been the center from
ayh;ch a larger liberty has radiated. She has learned many lessons
in the course of her parliamentary history and the greatest was that
people once enjoying constitutional rights and representative gov
ernment will die rather than suffer the abridgment of either. Our
taught that lesson, and when we took precedence of
lief oiir joint example impressed the people of the world. The re
sult is the granting of parliaments and representative powers in all
Europe except Russia and Turkey. Those governments remain
Oriental in form. It is the ancient Asiatic form, and its maintenance
in Europe is shared by the Czar and the Sultan. Between the two
there is nothing to choose. The Czar thinks otherwise because of
â¢what in his empire is called the beneficent institution of Orthodox
Christianity. But, judged by the results, there is no difference be
tween that and the Orthodox Mahometanism that exists in European
Tnrkev.
â¢ The experience of mankind is that in government, which is polit
ical, the recognition of the rights of man, his personal, political
rights, is to be considered and in its absence he is not compensated
t>y-the*Jcare which his government takes of his soul. As a rule the
strictest religious goverrJnient has been in all ages the most intoler
able political government. This is true in the rule of the Czar and
.the Sultan. The outside world has no hope of Turkey, but it did
â¢expect that Russia had been taught something in the hard school of
â experience, in which Japan is at present the school master, and
'would in this crisis deserve the helpful loyalty of the people by grant
ing them a voice in their government. But the ring of Grand Dukes
will not have it so, and the intelligent and aspiring people of Russia
have no recourse except the violent overthrow of avicious system.
VENEZUELA GETS UNPLEASANT.
PRESIDENT CASTRO, the gentle dictator of Venezuela, is re
ported to be lugging some big guns to the seaboard of his
.. country with the avowed intention of using them eventually
against the fleets of Uricle Sam. Further than that'Tresident Cas
tro has amused Jiimself by arbitrarily imprisoning citizens of the
Ujixted States, badgering the United States Consul and playing the
cut-up generally. President Castro feels his oats.
'..' The time is rapidly drawing near when a better understanding
of the intents and purposes of the Monroe doctrine on the part of
the belligerent South American republics must be inculcated. First
and above all else they must disabuse their minds of the erroneous
impression that Uncle Sam stands ready to resent any European
aggression u PO n their territories through sheer love of their idyllic
governments. Nor must they believe that the guns of the Old
World powers are warned away out of respect for the liberty. that
kindles its fires on the southern national altars. The brand of lib
erty that finds its general acceptance south of the isthmus would not
sell at par in an open market. This fact and this alone moves the
United States to uphold the integrity . of the South American re
publics, that it cannot look with favor upon the use of any part of
the American continent for the propagation of European colonial
schemes. This is because it must protect itself as the natural leader
of. affairs in the western world. ,t
Now this country is loth to play the policeman in the dis
turbed belt below Panama; that is not the spirit and intent of the
Monroe doctrine. But if such little nationals as Venezuelaâ for
whom, by the way, we but recently did a signal service in the.
matter of boundary adjustmentsâ if such so-called governments
continue to make themselves unpleasant and a general nuisance in
the family of nations, it may be incumbent upon Uncle Sam to incul
cate a little moral suasion into his policy of paternal protection.

HEALTH CULTURE
NOVEL
*-|pHB rivals are a man named Smigg.
Fat, lazy, smooth and wealthy,
11 And Amos Tibbies, brown and" big.
And poor and wise and healthy.
The heroine, fair Imogene,
At first seems prone to waver
Her two persistent swains between, '
Not knowing which to favor.
Fair Imogene Is hale and strongâ
For since she finished teething
She has been taught that it is wrong
To overlook deep breathing.
Her dally fare Is nuts and fruit,
And as at that she nibbles
She muses on the double suit
Pressed by both Smigg and Tibbies.
In chapter third Smi^g comes to call;
He pops the tender question;
He mentions his ancestral hall â
A very sage suggestion.
But Tibbies has convinced the maid
That houses are not needed â
That outdoor sunshine, breeze and shade
The house has superseded.
Still undismayed, Smigg comes to woo;
He mentions now his table,
And quotes a tempting menu through â
To buy all foods he's able.
He's foiled again, for Imogene
j Through Tibbies' long tuition
Believes the wheat grain and the bean
Are richest in nutrition.
Once more Smigg comes to seek her
hand â
This time he talks of dresses;
He hints at gowns and costumes grand
While he his love confesses.
"In fine attire, no girl on earth,"
Smigg says, "could match your
beauty."
Now, Tibbies flouts the work of Worth â
Says rough garb is our duty.
But Smigg, the crafty, begs that she
Will take It in advisement.
And hands her, still on bended' knee,
A fashion advertisement.
Poor Amos Tibbies keeps his health
But thinks no more of* marriage;
Smigg has to work to keep his wealth â
She has house, gowns and carriage.

VALUABLE OYSTER.
An oyster from Shrewsbury River
that found its way into the fish shops
of Thomas Mullaney, 522 West One
Hundred and Twenty-fifth street, and
was opened there last week, says the
New York Press, contained 195 pearls,
ranging from one which was 3%
karats in size to some that are mere
specks, weighing about one-twentieth
of a karat, the larger number being
about one-sixteenth of a karat in
weight.
The large pearl is irregular in form,
except that one of its sides is nearly
a perfect oval and its color Is not
even, but it could be mounted so as
to conceal its faults and expose a very
clear and beautiful ray. Two pearls,
next in wefght are about the size of
a pea, and are of perfect form and
very clear and distinct in ray and are
probably worth more than all the rest
put together. The others are merely
seed pearls, but all of them are high
ly iridescent and of perfect form.
Dr. I. M. Marks, the Amsterdam
avenue druggist, who is also an ex
pert on jewels, gave the value of the
find at $150.
"EASY MONEY."
Singing for phonograph seems to be
as high-paid musical exercise as there
is. A phonograph company has of
fered a prima donna, who sings at the
Metropolitan Opera-house this winter,
$14,000 for four songs. That is, $6000
as soon as the sonj^s are sung, and
$2000 a year for four years as a re
ward for not singing into any other
machine. Great and many are the
means of income of a goddess of
grand opera. She could live splen
didly on what she can get for using
a pill, a perfume, a piano or a phono
graph. â With the Procession, Every

NEW CARNEGIE STORY.
Andrew Carnegie found himself on
a street car in New York the other day
without a cent in his pocket. A fellow
passenger offered him the necessary
nickel, which was gratefully accepted.
"Are you coming back again?" asked
the stranger, who, on receiving - the
affirmative reply, said, "Then you'd
better take another nickel." The mul
timillionaire again accepted and asked
the benefactor's card. This was forth*
coming, and the next day the good
natured tmssenger received a case of
champagne and a cordial note of
thanks.

BURGLAR PLAYS
A DOUBLE ROLE
Honest Workman by Day
and Expert Cracksman
After the Sun Goes Down
BAFFLES LONDON POLICE
For Four Years He. Escapes
Suspicion, but Finally
Becomes Too Careless
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec 28.â If William Par
ker, who has just been sentenced to
fifteen months' > imprisonment, pos
sesses only a small share of that van
ity which Lombroso says is one of the
most striking characteristics - of the
criminal, he will find much solace for
his enforced retirement in recalling:
the encomiums lavished upon his ne
farious cunning by Scotland Yard of
ficials. He has again demonstrated
that fact still holds the lead over fic
tion, and his story will stimulate the
jaded Imagination of writers of de
tective fiction.
For more than four years he plied
the calling of a cracksman in the me
tropolis, displaying such amazing: skill
and celerity in looting that at one
time â for a period of two months â he
i% credited with having averaged four
burglaries a night, and yet he suc
ceeded in baffling the police. During
these years he was held in much es
teem in the neighborhood where he
lived as an industrious, faithful and
efficient workman. In the latter ca
pacity he gained the intimate friend
ship of several unsuspecting members
of the police force, which proved of
great assistance to him in eluding de
tection when the minions of the law
were spreading their nets to catch him.
His downfall was due entirely to his
disregard of one of the cardinal prin
ciples .which he had laid down for his
guidance as a criminal. But so skill
fully had he covered up his tracks
that, although it is certain he had
committed hundreds of burelaries.
only one could be proved against him.
On that account the Judge, much to
his regret, was precluded from inflict
ing a longer sentence.
Parker is only 24 years old, but his
plans show him to be possessed of a
perverted genius which places him far
above mature criminals, however ex
pert, who learn only from experience.
In his youth. he had been apprenticed
to a carpenter and was an excellent
workman. When he decided to become
a burglar he resolved to still keep to
his trade. A great student of criminal
literature, he had observed how profes
sional cracksmen exposed themselves to
suspicion and were compelled to con
tinually shift their ground because they
enjoyed no visible means of support. By
continuing to work as a carpenter he
could avoid being thus handicapped.
It necessitated double shifts, as It were
âcarpentering by day and robbing by
night â but he was content to make the
sacrifice for the sake of the additional
security it offered. He allowed himself
an occasional holiday, when he took his
fling in style, hiring a fashionable turn
out for the purpose, but when he thus
disported himself it was remote from
the scenes of his toil and plunder."
The premises he occupied consisted
of a bedroom, , sitting-room &nd work
shop. His rooms were neatly, but not
extravagantly furnished. There was
nothing about them to show that he
had other means than his trade of add
ing to his Income. To assist him In his
double role he fixed up a secret rear en
trance, by means of which he could ob
tain access to the street by traversing
the back yards of his neighbors. Thus
he escaped the suspicion which at
taches to a man who is known to keep
all sorts of hours. So well did he con
ceal his nocturnal movements that
among his friends he enjoyed an exem
plary reputation as a man who never
stayed out late o* nights.
In his burglaries he displayed re
markable prudence. His reading had
taught him that thieves were oftenest
run down by tracing the stolen prop
erty. Therefore he made it a rule to
take only money or small articles that
could not easily be identified. Better
small and safe hauls tnan rich hauls
was his motto. He played .the game
alone that he might run no risk of
being caught through the indiscretion
of a confederate; also because it en
abled him to keep all the swag himself.
He never mixed his trade and his
profession- As a carpenter he was an
honest man, as well as an efficient one.
Houses on which he worked were fre
quently robbed shortly afterward and
by him, no doubt, but he stoutly re
sisted all temptations to steal while
on a Job. As a workman his reputation
was above reproach. He cultivated
the police that he might obtain "tips"
from them as to what they were doing
to lay hold of him. Most of his burg
laries were committed in the Highgate
district. When their frequency aroused
the police to make strenuous efforts to
capture the criminal additional con
stables and "plain clothes" men would
be spread over the neighborhood. Then
the mysterious burglaries would sud
denly cease, to be renewed when the
extra force was withdrawn.
â¢ "The only inference," said Detective
Inspector Neil, who had cnarge of the
case,, "is that Parker learned of the
movements of the police through being
in touch with them and knew exactly
what they were doing." Â»
Nature had. bestowea upon him a
physiogonomy'that helped him to play
his dual role well. His features are of
the stolid type of the average British
workman who is content to plod
through life. There Is nothing in his
face to reveal the cunning and shrewd
Intelligence which he possesses. He
found it easy to make "pals" of the
police and they never suspected that
his outburst' of honest indignation
against the mysterious burglar who
was causing them so much trouble were
feigned.
With his plans so adroitly laid, Park
er, might have continued to play his
dual role of an honest workman and a
successful thief for. a long time to come
had he not succumbed to a temptation
which led him to violate his rule of
making only safe hauls.
One night in October he obtained en
trance to the house of a wealthy West
Highgate resident by cutting out a
pane of glass In the drawing-room win
dow. He was disappointed to find very
little money on the premises. On the
mantelpiece was a silver clock. He had
often passed over valuable clocks be
fore as too dangerous to meddle with,
but this one seemed to exercise a fatal
fascination for him; or perhaps his
long-continued Immunity and the ease
with which he had- baffled the police
had rendered him careless. Anyhow, he
decamped with the clock and later
committed the further indiscretion of
pawning it. The j police traced . it and
thereby obtained a clew by which final
ly, much to their own amazement, they
discovered that it had been pawned by
Parker, the man whom several of them
had chummed with.
"A '.man of his stamp and genius for
crime ; never j reforms in. prison," "said s a
Scotland Yard detective to : the .writer.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BLOOMINGTON. 111., Dec. 28.â There
are two children In Peoria County who
have six parents. This peculiar dis
covery waa made to-day when court
proceedings were filed. The children
are a girl of 7 and a boy of 5.
Their original parents were Mr. and
Mrs. Carl Orr of Averyville. Last Jan
uary the couple separated and Mrs.
Orr was awarded the custody of the
children and a divorce. She then was
married to William Bongartz of Free
port, where she now lives.
The mother recently visited Peoria
with her children and permitted them
to meet their father, who had since
married again. She returned to Free
port, leaving the children in the care
of the father, and upon her return
found that the father insisted on
keeping them. She then sued for a
writ of habeas corpus and this showed
that the children had been given over
to and adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Ed
ward Trapp of Averyville. who refuse
to give them up without court order.
The hearing is set for to-morrow.

MIRACULOUS ESCAPE
OF BRIDGE WORKMAN*
Fell From Structure 137 Feet Above
Water and Was Rescued
Alive.
Losing his balance while riveting
on a girder at the. top of the new
Williamsburg bridge. New York, to
day, Charles Summerfleld fell 137 feet
through the air, turned four complete
somersaults and landed In the river,
feet first, miraculously escaping death.
He sustained serious injuries, but the
doctors believe he will live.
Summerfleld, while stretching up
ward to put in a rivet, lost his footing
and fell. As he went down he caught
an ice-covered girder and held there
suspended above the river for several
seconds.
The workmen heard him cry for
help, and one of them tried to gather
up a rope to throw to him, but before
It could be slipped down Summer
field lost his hold.
Captain Kalllster of the tug For
tuna saw the man fall and headed for
him at full speed, just reaching him as
he was sinking the third time.
Summerfleld Is the fourth man to
fall from the Williamsburg bridge and
is the only one who was not killed
outright. Of these other three, two
were suicides and one was killed acci
dentally. â Cincinnati Enquirer. '
Battleships and Big Guns.
The war between Russia and Japan
has taught many lessons In warfare,
both at sea and on land. On the land
it is not unlikely that the most Im
portant instruction will be in the art
of sanitation. On thej sea there has
been the most decisive test of modern
naval architecture. This test seems to
have established the superiority of the
battleship over other classes of war
vessels and of big guns on such ships
over smaller guns, known as the sec
ondary battery. At the first naval
battle in the present war the great
guns on the Japanese battleships put
the Russian ships to flight before they
had approached each other closer
than four miles â a distance too great
for the six and eight inch guns to be
effective. That the Japanese could
strike their adversaries at that great
distance was an achievement in
marksmanship which has never been
excelled. Against such marksmanship
and such guns vessels of the cruiser
class carrying smaller guns would
stand no chance. The battleship with
its thirteen-inch guns manned by ex
pert marksmen could send a cruiser
to the bottom before the latter could
get within fighting distance. â Balti

Poverty and Science.
We must cease tinkering in a half
dozen different ways with the surface
.symptoms of poverty, and dig down to
the roots, says Â» W. H. Champness
in the Westminster Review, before we
can hope for any radical cure. All the
efforts of religion, philanthropy and
legislation having^ failed to mitigate
it, we must perforce turn to the great
modern miracle worker, science.
Boothe and Rowntree have estimated
that nearly 30 per cent of the city pop
ulations In Great Britain are below the
poverty line. What this line means
may be gathered from Mr. Rowntree's
description of a family above it. |Y?f:
This family must never spent a penny
on railway fare, must never buy a
half-penny newspaper, or concert
tickets, or write letters (because of the
postage), or contribute to the church,
or aid with money poorer neighbors, or
join "sick clubs'* or unions, .or buy
presents for the children. The father
must smoke no tobacco and drink no
beer. If a child falls 1 ill, the parish
doctor must be called; if it dies the
parish buries it. If any of these con
ditions are transgressed, and extra ex
penditure can only be met by limiting
the foodâ In other words, going hungry.
âNew York Globe.
when he gets out, but It. isn't* likely, he
will settle down to the burglary busi
ness again in London, he's too cautious
for that. He must have a lot of money
salted away somewhere,i and very like
ly he will go to America and resume
his career as a cracksman over there.
If he does the Yankee police will find
him a mighty hard man to nab, and he
may fool them as long as. he has fooled
us."
GEXERAIi KUROPATKIN*
IN EVERYDAY LIFE
Idol of the Russian Army Has a
Passion for Hard
Work.
At 66 General Kuropatkin has the
same restless energy that he had in
his youth when he stormed through
the horrors of Plevna with Skobeleff,
and he is one of the most famous mili
tary men now living. Like Skobeleff,
he is a great leader of men, and he
knows the value of theatrical pomp
and braggadocio that appeal to the
Tartar hearts of his Russian soldiers.
I'ut, In -spit* of his boasting addresses,
his ostentatious slapping on the back
of his "brother" Ivan, the private; in
spite of his carload of icons, amulets
and crosses, with the exhortations and
benedictions of his priests, he is a
cold-blooded calculator, patient and
untiring in his study of detail, modest
and Just. He is the ldoi of his army.
Endless toil has been the keynote of
his life.-
At 18 he scorned the fashionable
Imperial Guards and chose a commis
sion in the Turkestan Rifles, because
he wanted work. After brilliant ser
vice at Samarcand he returned to St.
Petersburg at 20 to complete his
studies in the Academy of the Gen
eral Staff. He was\a hereditary noble
of Pskoff, but he worked desperately
hard\and in 1874 took the highest
honors. On leave to study abroad
after tha Franco-Prussian â war he
helped to reorganize the French cav
alry. General de Galllfet, the first
cavalryman of France, declared in his
report that the most brilliant result of
the work had been gained through the
advice of young Kuropatkin. His re
markable strategic ability in the man
euvers near Metz made him the first
Russian to become an officer of the
Legion of Honor for military services.
He has been severely wounded sev
eral times. In the Russo-Turkis'a war
he was the battle brother of Skobeleff.
At Plevna, by Skobeleff's side, he saw
8000 of his chief's 18,000 fall. The
only officer not dead or wounded, he
led 300 men in a charge against a bat
talion of Turks. Only a hundred re
turned, but the Turks had been driven
back into the famous "Redoubt No.
IS." He has won every decoration for
valor that the Czar has in his gift.
Skobeleff said of him that he was the
coolest and hardest-nerved man he
had ever seen under flre. â World's
Work.
Dealing With Gypsy Moth.
The very fact that a group of promi
nent men in or around Boston are talk
ing of raising $60,000 to introduce a
parasite for the suppression or restric
tion of the gypsy and brown-tailed
moths shows how seriously the best
posted men take the pest. â¢ Yet In Prus
sia, where the gypsy moth is very well
known and rather common, it does not
do anything like the damage it has
done around here. The explanation,
scientific men say, is precisely that in
Germany the" parasite keeps the moth
down, while the moth was introduced
into this country without its old enemy.
Whatever is done in Massachusetts any
way, it is encouraging that there Is lit
tle talk about anv more State appro
priations. Some State legislation is
wanted, but it is rather of the kind
suggested by Mott Hallowellâ an act
that will hold the owner of land re
sponsible if he does not try to keep his
trees clear of the pest. â Boston Ad
vertiser.
Distribution of Immigrants.
There are communities in this coun
try which earnestly desire foreign im
migration. There are Others which are
pretty strongly opposed to it. It is
obvious to every one that the practical
immigration problem is one of distri
bution. The immigrant has a perverse
way of settling In those places which
do not want him and Ignoring those
places which do. Commissioners of im
migration for many years past have be
lieved that something in the â¢ way of
better distribution could be accom
plished by affording the States needing
labor an opportunity after the immi
grant has landed for giving him in
formation about conditions In their sec
tions and inviting him to settle there.
Commissioner Geperal Sargent renews,
the recommendation this year and asks
Congress for a chance to begin work of
this kincV at Ellis Island.â New York

GRAND DUICE TO BLAME
Scrgius Responsible for
tbe Arrogant Note of
Warning -to Zemstvos
SHUSHA. Russia. Dec. 2&.â Police
Chief Sakaroff was killed on the main
street here this morning.
6T. PETERSBURG, Dec. 28.â It Is
evident from the reports received from
the interior that the fairly good im
pression produced by the imperial man
ifesto on the subject of reforms may be
xnore than offset in many places by the
effect of the Government note of warn
ing to the Zemstvos. Private reports,
from Moscow especially, indicate that
much excitement prevails there, and
the gravest fears are expressed that
the ancient capital of Russia may be
tfce scene of sanguinary excesses. A
banquet arranged to take place there
last night on the anniversary of tho
Tronbetzskol revolution was stopped
by order of the police, and the Moscow
Zemstvo adjourned sine die as a pro
test.against the Government note and
the return of Grand Duke Sergius, the
Governor General of Moscow. The
Grand Duke is held to be responsible
for the note, which may signal a re
pewal of terrorism.
The Pskoff Zemstvo has followed the
lead of those of Chernigov and Moscow.
Altogether the moment is considered
critical, although the feeling in St.
Petersburg is quieter.
The papers are not disposed to re
gard the injunction to refrain from dis
cussing political matters. Under cover
of commenting on the manifesto, which
they really accept in a spirit of hope
fulness, they do not hesitate to point
out the vagueness of its terms and the
lack of guarantees.
Wine, president of the Committee of
Ministers, is acting with energy in pre
paring to organize the various commis
sions under the Committee of Ministers
to formulate the laws projected by the
manifesto. The destinies of Russia in
the immediate future seem to be in his
hands. The majority of the Ministers
are hostile to him, but with the warm
support of Interior Minister Sviatopolk-
Mirsky assured, no doubt is entertained
that WUtB will make himself complete
master of the situation.
The. big strike at the Baku oil fields,
coming at this time, is another cause
â¢fpr anxiety, as possibly forming a ral
lying cry for the workmen's organiza
tions.
. The meeting of the Zemstvo in Mos
cow lasted until 3 o'clock this morning.
Among those present were popular
writers, professors of the university.
Mining School and Technological Insti
tute,' editors and socialist workmen.
The text of the resolution, which was
adopted by 76G to 7 votes, after many
fervid speeches, was as follows:
.In. view of the horrors of the war, which
IS devcld of sense, and In view al*o of the
Â«^.orrrjpus 'sacrifices and ruin In which the
cbdmry is being involved, we. representing
the .liberal prolCFslon* and working classes,
protest against the war into which the Gov
ernment dragged the nation without consid
eration for the opinions or Interests of . the
"-â f-ar. i-eople ac<J we express our profound
bejief that only the nation itself can save
Russia from her difficulties through represen
tatives of the people elected by ballot on equal
rights. Our motto is peace and freedom.
MTXORITY STOCK ACQUIRED

New ilaven Railroad Wins Unusnal
CSisc in the Connecticut Supreme
Court.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 28.â A de
cision of the State Supreme Court made
public to-day Is considered of great
importance as bearing upon condemna
tion proceedings of minority stock in
consolidations and mergers of rail
roads. The case in point is that of the
New York, New Haven and Hartford
Railroad vs. Charles H. Offieid of Chi
cago, involving the condemnation of
the two remaining shares of the New
Haven and Derby Railroad stock held
by Offleld.
The court upholds the right of the
plaintiff to obtain the two shares by
condemnation proceedings under a stat
ute. The case will be appealed and it
Is expected will eventually be carried
to the United States Supreme Court.

GADSKI CONCERT
AT ST. FRANCIS
A SMART AFFAIR
BY SALL.Y SUARP.
Lucky Mr. Tauscher!
What a lucky chap, to dwell in the
eternal ioy of that Gadski voice and
that Gadski smile!
It was this dulcet duality that lured
the love of 300 of us last night at the
concert at the St. Francis, for know
ye all that last night marked the debut
of the St. Francis Musical Art Society,
whose mission it is to give us of the
West such musical pabulum as we
need â and such artists as we want.
Hence Gadski, bless her!
Unlike the Francesca concert, the
stage was placed in the middle of the
west wall of the ballroom, with the
great mantel mirror its animate back
ground. In this manner not a whisper
was lost, although it did bring the
fair songstress rather close to her au
dience. But to the credit of both let it
be said that the proximity was produc
tive of a warmth and a friendly neigh
borliness that brought out of the Gad
ski throat the best that was in it, and
that best was superb. The following is
the programme she gave:
Tart 1. classical sones â tt, "Wldmung"
(Schuir.ann) ; b. "Nussbaum" (Schumann*; c.
"I>r Jxlelne Fritz" (Weber); d, "Aus Mc-inen
Grotsen Scfamerzen" (Frana); Â«, "'KrikODig"
(bt-huberl).
Part 2, modÂ«rn miscellaneous arias and
songsâ a. piano colo. "Wotan** Abschfed und
I-cuerzauber" (Watrner): b, aria. "Aida"
< Verdi); c, "Vorabend" (Cornelius) ; d, "Stram
pelchen" (Hlldach); e, -Mel Bua" <Bahrn);
t. '"Von Ewtser I^iebe" (Brahms); w. "Traum
L>urch die Uammerung" (R. Etrause); h,
"Caecilie" (R. Straus*).
Part 3. Wacner â a, piano solo, prelude,
'Tristan end Isolde" (Wagner); b, traume,
study. "Tristan and Isolde" (Wagner); o,
symyhony. "SchlummerliPd" (Wagner); d,
Senta's ballade, '"Fli-egcnder Hollander" (Wag
ner).
Ot these "Erlkoni^," the axla from
"Aida," the "Mei Bua" of Bohm and
the two Strauss numbers proved to
be favored ones of the two first parts,
when an encore was asked for â and
charmingly given â "I Gave My Love
a Rose." Ah! but that was sweet,
sweet as the breath of the rose Itself.
In the AYagner selections Gadski
chose to blend lyrics with dynamics,
and the result was a Joy-
You should have heard the clatter of
palm on palm at Santa's "Ballade."
It brought madame back with a witch
ing smile and gladsome eye, as she
gave a splendid little finale to a bril
liant programme.
How fresh and fascinating she looked
in her robe â Venetian, ladiesâ with her
white shoulders and splendid chest,
framed squarely with a lace bertha,
wherein nestled a great diamond and
emerald butterfly. On her pretty head
she wore a tiara holding: aloft two su
perb diamondsâ a picture in all truth.
The pianist Herr Selmar Meyrowitz,
looks like ah artist, and plays like one.
His solos were well received, partic
ularly his "Tristan and Isolde." Herr
Meyrowitz Is a man of social distinc
tion on his own heath over the ocean,
likewise a man of reputation.
Many stunning gowns were seen in
the concert room, not a few of which
were full dress, a Gothamite sugges
tion. But somehow we of the West
haven't yet arrived at the decollete
stage of concert or operaâ but we may
â some day.
We all remember the time our men
wore high hats and sack coats. They've
outgrown that, which fact shows pro
gress. Perhaps next year. If Mr.
Greenbaum be good to us for the rest
of this year, full dress may reward
him then.
It gives a concert atmosphere.

Assemblymen W. F. Gates of Oro
ville, E. M. Pyle of Santa Barbara, H.
S. G. McCartney of Los Angeles, to
gether with Charles S. Hardy and Gra
ham Babcock of San Diego, wero at the
court of the Palace yesterday.
The nominating speeches at Sacra
mento will be Interesting features of
the Senatorial contest. It is already,
settled that Benjamin W. Hahn of
Pasadena In the Senate and Fred W.
Houser of Loa Angeles in the Assem
bly will nominate Frank P. Flint for
the United States Senate. It is the
common impression that Dr. Rowell of
Fresno will make in the Senate tho
leading address in behalf of Senator
Bard's candidacy. David T. Perkins
of Hueneme will surely speak for the
Senator in the Assembly. It is expected
that Senator Thomas H. Selvage -and
Assemblyman George T. Rolley of
Humboldt will present the claims of
George A. Knight. The privilege of
placing the name of A. Ruef before the
Legislature may be accorded to
Thomas E. Atkinson In the Assembly
and John H. Nelson In the Senate,
Governor Pardee went to San JosÂ«
yesterday forenoon and returned to the
city last evening. â
JUDICIAL ASPIRANTS.
In applications for appointment of
Judges to the Court of Appeals for the
Northern District, the Democrats! be
ing In the minority, seem to have the
greater number of aspirants than the
Republicans, who are conceded, under
the constitutional amendment, two ap
pointees.
As Governor Pardee is a Native Son
three prominent Democratic brothers
of the orderâ Judge J. E. Prewett of
Placer, Judge R. C. Rust of Amador
and Judge C. E. McLaughlin of Plumas
â have each lined up to their support
the several and different branches of
the order v*-hich are able to exercise or
assert various political and fraternal
claims on the generosity of Governor
Pardee.
A reporter, while talking to a prom
inent Republican State official in this
City, also a Native Son, the other day
about the likelihood of who the Demo
cratic appointee would be, was told
that if the wishes of the majority of
the Republican State officials were
asked there would be a unanimity of
indorsement for W. A. Gett of Sacra
mento, who was the Democratic candi
date for Attorney General. The reason
given was that Mr. Gett made a good,
clean, decent fight, and after the
"smoke of battle had cleared away"
and various Democratic politicians
were endeavoring to urge a contest, he
accepted the result as a part of the
immutable law of politics, and said he
was not sore and would not be a party
to a contest.
GKXEROSITY REME3IBERED.
It was principally through* his efforts
that a foolish contest was not inaug
urated on behalf of Franklin K. Lane,
the defeated Democratic candidate for
Governor.
It is questionable whether Mr. Gett
would accept the position, if it were
tendered to him, by reason of his being
in the enjoyment of a lucrative prac
tice both in San Francisco and at Sac
ramento.
The solid eight Democrats of the
Legislature will have the privilege of
extending the party vote for United
States Senator as a compliment to
some deserving Democratic statesman.
The Democratic caucus will probably
resolve to extend the compliment on
the first ballot to Charles J. Heggerty
of San Francisco. Later on Gavin Mc-
Nab, M. F. Tarpey, James H. Budd,
James H. O'Brien, Charles Wesley
Reed, James D. Phelan, Thomas J
Geary, M. V. Snyder, Tim Spellacy and
William T. Jeter may be compli
mented.

DANGLADA GETS
INTO A TANGLE
Salesman Tailor Plunges
Into Confusion in a Case
of Chinese Habeas Corpus
IDENTIFIES WRONGTBOY
Mongolian Trickery Exposed
in an Attempt to IiaiidJee
Hin as a Native American
A. Danclada, : salesman ;for a tailor
supply firm in the Jennie Flood build
ing, while under, oath In United States
Commissioner Heacock's court yester
day positively Identified Lum '.Wong as
Jee Hin. Danglada was given every op
portunity to examine Lum Wong. Even
then he swore "that Lum Wong-was Jee
Hin.
Jee Hin happened to be absent at
the time, and the little incident illus
trating the duplicity of the Chinese
character settled his fate, for an v order
was made remanding him for." deporta
tion to the custody whence he had been
taken on a writ of habeas corpus.
Jee Hln's case had been continued
until to-day for further testimony as
to his right to land. The documents
produced at the further hearing were
found to have been altered by some
person Interested in having him landed.
Mr. Danglada took the oath as a wit
ness cheerfully and without a snip.
Then he told how he had known the
boy's father, a tailor, for thirty years
and how he had often seen the. boy, the
last time being five years ago.
Sitting in the courtroom at the time
was a Chinese youth named Lum Loy,
who was awaiting a hearing on habeas
corpus as to his right to be landed as a
native American. After Mr. Danglada
had finished that part of his testimony
Mr. McKinlay pointed to Lum Wong
and asked, "Is that Jee Hin, the son of
your frien<^?"
"I think so," was the response!
"Well, I want you to be sure. Is that
the boy about whom you have been
testifying?"
"Yes."
"Now, I want you to . be positive.
Your evidence is very important in thi3
case. Take him to the window and ex
amine him closely."
Danglada did as directed and replied
that the boy was Jee Hin and that he
was positive In his Identification.
In the meantime Alfred Worley, at
torney for Jee Hin, was In a cold sweat.
While Mr. McKlnlay was examining
Danglada, Judge Heacock kept Worley
transfixed with his eye. When the wit
ness was turned over to him for exam
ination the Judge and Mr. McKlnlay
wore broad smiles.
"You are not quite sure that this is
the boy?" asked Mr. Worley.
"Yes," replied Danglada hesitatingly.
After a few more questions in -the
same vein by the lawyer Danglada ad
mitted that he might have been mis
taken.
During the progress of the case Wor
ley accused Chinese Interpreter David
D. Jones of having told Judge Heacock
that the man who claimed to be the
boy's father was a Sam Yup, while the
boy was a See Yup, or vice versa, and
that therefore they could not be father
and son.- Jones denied the statement.
lie admitted that he had -made, such a
statement to Worley, but Insisted that
he had not told the Judge or any one
else. Mr. Worley by this time betrayed
considerable irritation and spoke to the
interpreter in a way that Mr. Jones
resented. He flatly refused to put any
more of Worley's questions to a Chi
nese witness on the stand, and Judge
Heacock sent to the Chinese Bureau
and obtained another interpreter for
the case.

Joe Nolan,/l2 years old, living at
1210 Mission street. - was knocked
down and injured by a Market-street
car. last night, opposite the Central
Theater. The lad tried to cross the
street, but the car was too near him,
and before he had reached the other
side of the track he was knocked
down. The brakeman immediately
stopped the car and prevented the
youngster from being crushed beneath
the wheels. He was taken to the
Central Emergency Hospital, where it
was found, that the lad had probably
sustained a fracture of the skull. His
body was badly bruised and it is be

NEW yoRK.' Dec 2S.âThe same dull ris
$ek" tr.Â£! k*t aa<J the eaiae largely professional
e: i-.":.' ia the deaUnÂ£s were '.a evidence again

whfcrh Here picked for a5var.ces were much
'See* ISfltK&Uml on eentlmect by their move
'xsentk. tbafi were the high grade ttaiidard
.ytocti' Â»t.'.ch were conspicuous yesterday and
Â»til'i'"'eS~*c<2 evltience of reUizing to-day. This
Vaef-'r^jiably crue of New York Central, the
Â«tren/rtij cf .which infustd cor.ndeace through
put tfce^ whole market ytstorday. Low grade
indtisirial ElOcks ccme forward to-day. NewÂ»
*aÂ» .u:ii:orn.!y favorable for values, and the
extraordinary ea*e 0' money afforded means
tor' "embarking ia- stock market commitments.
But the dftnenEior.E of the day's business la
sufficiently convincing that there was no wifle
m read s Interest in the market. There is a
general belief that the lifting of prices is due
in eo:ne d^crc-e to the desire among great
financial inmtutio&c to help out that item in
their ajinual statement which is tilled 'mir
ket value of securities bÂ«rld." There is no
doubt of the scarcity of stocks offering at
irtsem. to that the process of marking up
price* is cpr.ducted a* & minimum of the ex
l*nse lavoived in assorting offeringa on the
advance. The cfinloa is widely held that an
active demand lor securities will be revived
in January, and it is supposed that preront
holders of stocks are anxious to ete prices
at a profitable level for themselves when this
â¦-xpectfd demand awakens. Advances for these
causes are justly attributed to eonw-what nar
row professional factors rather than to a
broad market demand for securities, but they
ere Figisinc;:nt. cf the underlying ctrtngth of
market., conditions nevertheless, without which
the profession*! tactics would, be unavailing
to move prices. The Interest manifested in
the industrials to-day was stimulated by the
color of trade ad\ices, esi>ecially from all de
rartrnente of the iron and ateel trade. Am
ciraraeted Copper responded to a fresh ad
vance !n crude copper and to a rerival of
the European demand for the rnetsX Refined
eugars were advamctd. The cottoa market
rff.ectÂ«d the pruwlng conviction that the Oov
ernmtnt'e estimate for an unprecedented yield
cf that crop is warranted, a fact that may
have It* naturally beneficial effect on stocks
modified by the refitted effect of speculative
idsws in cottAB.' Such importance was at
(tachtd to the'relief fir the breaking of the
(tdtcutn from wjene ar-rioirs restrictions on ln
ijlustrliil activity. A new high record price for
jfejortljern Securities on the curb was a fea
ture .Â«f. the day. The market closed quite

NEW YORK. Dec. 28.â The cotton market
broke 30 to 33 points on the census bureau's
ginr.ers' report, indicating a crop in excess
cf the Government's estimate. Thers was
heavy trading en the decline. ."â¢ â 
The bears contended that the tinners', re
port probably forecasted a crop of nearly 13 -

weakness since the opening, broke Eharply,
with January- selling around 0.C6c Slarch
6.63c and May 6.98o. or a net decline of 22
to 25 points and a break of practically $<S a
bale in two weeks' time. The markft was
very active during thÂ© afternoon, with big

Future Grain and Provisions. . < I
CHICAGO. Dec. 28! â The wheat market was \
weak at the start. Influenced by lower prices j
a^ Liverpool many of yesterday's buyers were j
liberal sellers when trading began". With
only a moderate demand initial quotations !
showed May %e*Vic to H@%? lower at $1 14Â® :
1 14%. Additional selling soon developed upon â 
receipt, of a cablegram from Argentina by a;
local commission house claiming that the crop 1
was in excellent condition and that shipments
â¢will begin in about four weeks. ,As a result
the market becajne still weaker. May grad
ually declining to $1 13%. There was also I
some selling occasioned by the heavy fall of !
snow which, it was claimed, would greatly
btnent growing wheat. Weakness at Min- |
neapolis was another factor that contributed ,
to the decline here. Two or three prominent
lcrgs sold freely during the latter part of the <-
day. Offerings were readily taken by shorts
and in consequence' part of the early loss was '
regained, but tho prevailing undertone was !
one of weakness. Final quotations on May i
were at $1 14.
The corn market was weak. May opened a '
shade to y t a lower at 45%@45%c and closed ;
at 45?4c.
Trading in oats was of small volume. May
closed at 31 %c.
Provisions were easy. At the close May
pork was off a shade, lard was down 2^c and
ribs were 2\Â«@!>c lower. : .

CODLIN MOTH'S
ENEMY ARRIVES
Horticultural Commissioner
Cooper Receives a Con
signment of Parasites
IMPORTS HARDY INSECT
Destroyer of Pests Is Ex
pected to Save the State
Many Millions of Dollars
The largest consignment of bene
ficial parasites ever Imported into
California to kill off the pests that are
dangerous to horticulture was* re
ceived yesterday by Horticultural
Commissioner Cooper. There were
more than 1200 of the parasites in
all. They axe all to be used for the
propagation of the millions of flies
that are expected to exterminate the
codlin moth in California, and thereby
â¢ to add millions of dollars to the an
nual value of the apple crops of this
â State.
Like their predecessors that were
received from George Compere, who
â¢secured them in his travels in South*
em Europe, it Is believed that they
are the proper Insects to do the most
g-ood. In fact. Mr. Compere, who has
studied their work in. Southern Eu
rope, reports that had the Governor
t charged the Horticultural Commis
'â loner -with the mission of .preparing
a" aet of agents to control the codlln
'moth he could not have provided a
â better set than nature has supplied in
these flies.
; : The 'first of the codlln moth de
stroyers are hatching out In tha
ferry building-, and the flr6t dlstrtbuÂ«.
tions -will be made among the hor
' tlculturists of the State during thÂ»
â  coming year.
â¢A strong demand has been made for
' eoaiin moths on â which to feed the
parasites while they are multiplying
..In the offices of the Horticultural
Commissioner In this city. Farmers
â¢have heard the appeal that has been
Â«ent out for food for the parasites. As
a eonseauence Infected orchards have
"-.been made the bases of supplies,
jforae ojf the parasites that were re
ceived yesterday will be placed In
storage'. The insects hibernate when
â¢ Printer comes in cold countries. They
will lire in the temperature of any
Vyid where apples -will grow and are
not killed by the cold.

FRUIT DEALERS
ON DEFENSIVE
Form Association for the
Purpose of Buying Di
rectly From the Grower
TO BETTER CONDITIONS
Goods Could Be Received
Without Gjoing Through
the Hands of Middlemen
Articlrs of incorporation were filed
yesterday by the Retail Fruit Dealers
of San Francisco, claiming all the priv
ileges under the statute on corpora
tions, for doing a general business. The
capital stock is 5500,000, of which $2350
has been subscribed by the following
directors: Joseph del Carlo, $500; John
Witt. 5500; J. L. Pollto, $500; G. Maltag
llata, 5200; H. G. Darrimon, 5150; Peter
Costamagna, 5200; W. Williams, $300.
The officers of the association are:
President, Frank Galli; vice president,
John Witt; treasurer, Joseph del Carlo;
secretary, John L. Pollto. The direct
ors are Henry G. Darrimon, John Che
lini, W. WilllamB and Peter Costa
magna. There are 350 stockholders.
The object of the dealers in incorpor
ating is to establish co-operative houses
for the object of dealing directly with
the growers of the State and buying
their goods at a lower rate. There has
been much dissatisfaction among the
dealers in regard to the way fruit has
been handled. They are compelled to
pay a high price to the Jobbers for
their goods, and In order to dispose of
them to the consumer they must sail
them at a price which leaves them but
a little profit for their labor.
If the co-operative stores are estab
lished the retailer could deal through
the association directly with the
grower and offer him a better price
than he has been receiving and also
receive a larger "profit for himself.
The first attempt to establish a co
operative store will probably be made
during the coming fruit season.
Good Time Ends in Death.
David Perceval, who had roomed at
681 Howard street, started out to
have a good time during the Christ
mas holidays, but miscalculated on
the quantity of liquor that was nec
essary to produce the desired result.
He drank so much that excessive al
coholism ended his earthly career
soon after his removal to the Emer
gency Hospital yesterday. The Cor
oner took charge of the remains.

INVENT DEFENSE
REFLECTS LACK OF INGENUITY
WEAKNESS SURPRISES COURT
BY JAMES O. CRAWFORD.
It was a spectacle both pathetic and
ludicrous that confronted Police Judge
Mogan when five masculine slaves of
the ODium habit were arrayed before
him to answer to the charge of vagran
cy. Each member of the quintet was a
woeful picture of physical debility and
sartorial dilapidation, yet each emaci
ated countenance was illumed with
fatuous hope."
They were arrested by Patrolman
Brady, who averred that they violated
the Injunction confining them to China
town? by visiting a drug store at Grant
avenue and Berry place for the pur
pose of purchasing "dope."
"Thov have had time and onnortunity
to put their hoppy heads together and
devise a defense, your Honor," said the
officer, "and the confidence shown by
them indicates that it's a corker.V
And it was. "The Human Skeleton
Kid." booked as John Cullen, an
nounced with show of pride that he
had unanimously been elected to serve
as spokesman for the group, not one
of whom had. he added, "crossed the
dead line" with the object in view
which the, policeman alleged. The fact
was that each one of them was em
ployed in some capacity at the medi
cine shop in question and was going to
work when arrested. If the court had
no objection he would describe the par
ticular vocations of- ca^h defendant, he
having jotted-down the same as protec
tion against a rather treacherous mem
ory. The court offering no objection, he
drew from his tatters a dirty bit of
wrapping paper and read as follows:
"Human Skeleton Kidâ Sweeps out
store every night at 11 o'clock.
"Nosey Jackson â Wipes woodwork at
the same time.
"Hypo McCulloughâ Sees If the drug
store man has any messages to deliver.
"Jimmy the Ragâ Feeds the cat and
empties the rat traps.
"Collars O'Brien â Washes bottles."
"An" dat's all dere's to it," said Mr.
Cullen, folding his documentary refer
ence and nodding his unkempt head at
the bench. "We's all hard-woikin' mugs
an', if youse don't let us out we loses
our chobs; don't we, kids?" â¢
The response was volubly affirmative,
and Mr. Cullen smiled with the non
chalance affected bv the advocate who
considers his case as good as won.
"Mr. Cullen, your lack of ingenuity
surprises me," said his Honor. "Of
course, the officer could bring the drug
gist here to brand your plea as a fabri
cation, but I won't put him, to that
trouble. You might have made It so
much more Interesting by averring that
you were employed as a medium of
testing the efficacy of new medicines
or medical appliances, or to pose as
living examples of before and after tak
ing certain specific remedies. The fact
is, however, that you deliberately dis
obeyed this court's order that you re
main within the boundaries of China
town, and for that offense I will send
you and your fellow, defendants to jail
for twenty-four., hours, at the expira
tion of which period you are to proceed
to the CeleBtial quarter and stay there."
The wretched five looked very wretch
ed, indeed, as they shufflingly followed
the bailiff Jallward.
The Christmas tree, emblematic of
peace on earth and good will 'twlxt
men, figured as a basis of discord in
the home of Edward McDonald's mar
ried sister at 906 Bryant street. Mr.
McDonald was awakened from slum
ber by feminine screams, and, rushing
to the sitting-room, he found his sister
valiantly endeavoring to protect her
Christmas tree from the vandal hands
of John Doe, who had been Invited to
inspect It. â¢ After soundly trouncing
the violator of hospitality Mr. McDon
ald ejected him from the house and
soon afterward was arrested for dis
turbing the peace. Judge Fritz dis
missed the case.
There was a Christmas party at the
home of Bernhart Johnson, 324 Rltch
street, and Mr. Johnson was "rushing
the growler," when James Pettlt of
224 Rltch street waylaid him' on the
street and demanded a drink from. the
brimming can. Mr. Johnson declined
to give to another the beverage In
tended for his guests and when * Mr.
Pettlt endeavored, to obtain; by, force
what he .failed to secure by suasion
he was struck on the head with- the
can, the foamy contents, of which
bespattered him from head to foot
and gave him the semblance of a
Santa Claus heavily, laden with snow.
He retaliated by casting fragments of
rock at Mr. Johnson until that gen
tleman had him arrested for battery.
Mr. Johnson told Judge Cabaniss that
his loss of the beer caused him less
pain that did the spots on his arms
and. shoulders that stopped the stones
cast by Mr. Pettit The case is un
der advisement
It developed that professional ' jeal
ousy, prompted Thomas Shirley's
breaking up of the Yuletide party
given by Mrs. Maddox at c her resi
dence, 215 Tehama street. Mr. Shir
ley was booked to appear as Santa
Claus at midnight ; and distribute the
presents dangling from the Christmas
tree, but his non-appearance at that
hour provoked Mrs. Maddox *to en
sragre another gentleman to fill the role
and thus it happened that when Mr.
bnJrley arrived on the festive scene he
found that the gifts had been disposed
of and the punchbowl half emptied
by the substitute impersonator of Kris
Kingrle, who was enjoying the popu
larity that Mr. Shirley had intended
to earn for himself. The story of how
Mr. Shirley felled the Christmas tree
and violently attacked Santa Claus has
already been told. In 'view of the lat
ter disclosures Judge Mogan has given
h.'mself another twenty-four hours to
decide Mr. Shirley's fate.
For five consecutive days and nights
Paul Ray had been drinking intoxi
cants at brief intervals, and when he
entered a Kearny-street restaurant and
ordered to be served with coffee and
cake his nerves were unsteady. In lieu
of cake the waiter laid before him a
twisted bit of pastry technically term
ed " a snake," and Mr. Ray's eyes no
sooner perceived it than he sprang
from his chair with a scream of af
fright and rushed frantically toward
the doorway, colliding with and smash-
Ing a glass panel en route, for which
he was arrested and charged with ma
licious mischief.
"It wasn't malicious, 'cause I didn't
see the glass partition," he pleaded to
Judge Mogan. "When that serpent
thing was placed, on the table it
squirmed and hissed at me. and I was
too scared to see anything while I
was trying to get away from it."
He will be sentenced to-day.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
Samuel Chamley, M. D., and C. B.
Waller, M. D., met and mixed at Third
and Market streets last Saturday aft
ernoon, and a result of the collision
was Dr. Chamley's arraignment before
Judge Mogan on the charge of batter
ing Dr. Waller.
Details of the fight have been pub
lished. Dr. Waller alleges that Dr.
Chamley falsely^ accused him of the
authorship of certain newspaper ar
ticles that reflected unfavorably on
Dr. Chamley's character, and that
when Dr. Waller denied the impeach
ment he wasipunimeled by Dr. Cham-
Icy. The defense will be heard next
Saturday.
Patrolman E. E. Lloyd said that
when certain householders informed
him of the surreptitious removal of
bread delivered upon their respective
doorsteps his heart was stirred by pity
for the unknown thief. He thought it
was tough that in the midst of a sea
son synonymous with plenty of good
cheer some poor wretch' should be
compelled to steal in order to save him
self and may be a sick wife and seven
bright but helpless . children from
starvation, and he hoped to detect the
unfortunate one and provide him with
means to avert the necessity of pilfer
ing. As the complaints multiplied,
however, he could, not help thinking it
remarkable that so much bread should
be required to feed a single family,
and when he discovered that one morn
ing on one block no less than seven
doorsteps had been plundered his pity
completely gave way to annoyance,
and he resolved to lay In wait for the
robber. That was how he came to
catch Amara Esmond and to charge
him with petty larceny. In the pris
oner's possession was a large gripsack
and In the gripsack were eight loaves,
which apparently had been stolen from
as many houses.
Mr. Esmond had no particular de
fense to offer, other, than that he stole
bread not for bread's sake, but because
he could easily dispose of it for money.
He had no starving wife or famishing
babies to provide with sustenance, and
the pecuniary proceeds of his plunder
were spent solely for his own comfort,
mostly for liquids. Judge Cabaniss gave
him thirty days.
Injured by a Street Car.
William McCarthy, a. laborer, while,
"under the influence of liquor yester
day, attempted to cross Fourth street
in front of an approaching Kentucky
street car. He failed to clear the
track and was hit by the car buffer
and thrown down. When picked up
he was found to , have received seri
ous , injuries to his back. From the
Potrero Hospital Dr. Buell sent the
patient to the Central Emergency
Hospital for treatment.
McCormick Gets Six, Months.
: John McCormick, a sailor, was sen
tenced to serve six months in the
County Jail by Judge Dunne yester
day. He was tried for grand larceny,
but ';, oonvicted of petty larceny. He
stole $2 50 from F. W. Smith, a sailor,
in a saloon on East street on Octo
ber 23.

Attorney Has an Uncomfort
able Morning 'While He
Testifies in Monnier Trial
PROPONENT IN TEARS
Wife of Deceased Wine Mer
chant Weeps When Telling
of Son's Attack on Father
I A mixing up of an attorney's state
ments by Sullivan and Roche, counsel
for George Monnier, who is suing for a
, share of his father's fortune; the preco-
I clous actions of the contestant, who at
the age of 3 years began drinking
liquor, and a description of the son's
assault on his father with a cane added
interest to the proceedings yesterday in
j Judge Graham's court.
j Attorney M. C. Hassett was called to
j the stand by George D. Collins, counsel
I for Mrs. George Monnier, the pro
r ponent, to testify as to his beginning
i of the suit for an annulment of the
son's marriage on the ground that the
young man was not of age. The wit
ness was called for the purpose of
j showing that Monnier Sr. advised with
j him with the view of having the suit i
brought.
Hassett told of the arrangement he
made with Monnier to take up the case, -
and said that the consultation took
place at the time the opening com
plaint was filed.
1 On cross-examination Sullivan and
Roche produced the annulment proceed
i ings in evidence and showed that the
J original complaint was signed by Has
i sett several months previously to the
time of filing. The witness then assert
ed that he thought his signature had i
been added after the witnesses had'
signed the document, and then recol
lected that I#awyer Barry had charge
of the opening of the case.
Roche then asked the witness wheth
er he dictated the document, and if not
whether he was In the habit of signing'
legal papers that he did not read. To I
this Hassett finally said he did not re- j
member the beginning of the annul- 1
ment suit, but he thought that what- j
ever the record showed must be the
correct statement of the proceedings.
He denied that his "name had been
fixed to the opening complaint until
after the proceedings had been started.
. J. B. Claveril, who was formerly em
ployed by Monnier Sr., caused much
laughter by testifying as to the unruly
actions of George Monnier Jr. at the
early age of 3 years, when he often
swore at his father, and on one occa
sion climbed on the bar and helped
himself to liquor. Bailiff Lemke was
compelled to rap for order several times
before the merriment subsided.
The latter part of the day's session
was consumed by Mrs- Monnier Sr.,
who described the fight between father
and son, in which George broke a cane
over his- father's head. She told how
George came Into the garden, where his
father was working, and made an in
sulting remark. His father called him
a loafer, whereupon he retorted with
a vile epithet. Monnier chased his son
into the parlor with a garden spade,
but according to the witness did not
strike him. She then said that George
seized a cane and struck his father,
causing blood to flow.
At this point Mrs. Monnier was com
pelled to cease testifying In order to re
gain control of herself. In words inter
spersed with crying the witness told of
Monnier's agony at the ingratitude of
his son, his threat to disinherit him and
his tragic command to his wife to place
the pieces of cane In his coffin when he
died. > â¢â 'nil
Several other witnesses were called
to testify as to the quarrels in the fam
ily and Monnier's desire to avoid scan
dal. The case will continue this morn-
Ing at 10 o'clock.

TAKE PATTERN
FROM MISSIONS
Preliminary Plans Embody
Governor Pardee's Wish
for California Building
Governor Pardee desires to have the
mission type of architecture exempli
fied in the construction of the Califor
nia State building to be erected at the
Lewis and Clark Exposition at Port
land next July.
Preliminary drawings for the build
ing have been prepared by local archi
tects. These were examined yesterday
by J. A. Filcher, Commissioner for Cal
ifornia to St. Louis, and by Mr. Bur
rell of the Burrell Contracting Com
pany, which has erected several build
ings at Portland for the Lewis and
Clark show. The general Idea embod
ied is that of a central structure sur
mounted by a dome, with four wings
radiating from the center, each repre
senting a separate California mission.
The California Legislature will un
doubtedly make an appropriation for
a building at Portland. Plans for the
structure are necessarily tentative at
this time, but Governor Pardee thinks
that an understanding may be reach
ed earlier with the legislators by pre
senting to their attention something
that will pictorlally approximate what
may finally be adopted. He also be
lieves that the idea of having the mis
sion architecture developed was valu
able in attractingattention at St. Loula
and will be considered equally attract
ive at Portland. x The size of the build
ing for Portland will depend on the ap
propriation to be made at Sacramento.
When the Legislature voted 5120,000
for the California exhibit at St. Louis
there wjis alsa an appropriation of
$20,000 for the preliminary expenses of
the Lewis and Clark Exposition. This
is the money that is now available and
is to be used aa needed. The building
at Portland will probably be made to
hold the California exhibit and to con
tain the offices and living apartments
of the California Commissioners under
one roof.
JAMES WOODS Wllili
3IAXAGE TILE ST. FRAN'CIS
Directors of the Big Hostelry Select
a New York 3Ian for the
Position.
It was officially announced by the
directors of the St. Francis Hotel yes
terday that their negotiations for a
new manager of that hostelry had fin
ally terminated in the acceptance of
the position by James Woods of New
York. He is expected here about
January 10 and will immediately en
ter upon his duties. Woods is at pres
ent room clerk of the Waldorf-Asto
ria of New York. He was formerly
connected with the Hotel Wolcott of
New York and the St. Chartfei Hotel
of New Orleans.
The selection of a man to fill the
position of manager of the St. Fran
cis Hotel, formerly held by Allan Pol
lok, has proved a trying ordeal to the
directors of the hotel company, and
Woods' formal acceptance of the po
sition comes as a great relief to the
gentlemen who have been directing
the affairs of that big establishment,
and to none more so than Will Dohr
mann, who has been temporarily act
ing as manager. It was stated yester
day by Director Thomas that Woods
had wired his acceptance two days
ago and would proceed to this city as
soon as he can arrange his affairs In
New York.
Early Morning Fire at the Grand.
Shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday
morning Morse's patrolman, W. A.
Read, at the Grand Hotel noticed
smoke issuing from the basement of
the hotel into the lobby. A hurried
investigation by himself and Night
Watchman Elmer Fields led to the
discovery that the smoke was coming
from the basement of the Southern
Pacific Company's ticket office, , which
occupies the corner of the Grand. A
chemical engine responded to a still
alarm. It was found that a defective
furnace in the basement of the ticket
office i had set flre to the flooring and
spread to a pile of rubbish. The
smoke slowly spread to the basement
of the hotel and then to the office
floor. The fire was extinguished be-
fore the guests of thÂ» Grand -wert
aware than any danger had threat'
ened.them. .
