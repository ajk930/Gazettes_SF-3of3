LONDON. March 3. â News from the Far East, published this morning, indicates the correctness of the information received in "Washington as to a change in the war plans of the Japanese,
involving a postponement of the attempt to capture Port Arthur. Official reports from Port Arthur show that not only was there no lighting there on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, but that the
Japanese fleet apparently has withdrawn temporarily. Japan is centering all her efforts at present upon the attempt to wrest Northern Korea from the Russians and send an army across the Yahi
for the invasion of Manchuria. The crisis is nearing in that region, and any hour may bring news of a battle that will decide the mastery of the frontier. While the movements of the Japanese
army in Korea are still cloaked with the utmost secrecy, It is probable that the Mikado has at the present moment forces aggregating 120,000 nearing the vicinity of Pingyang.

According to the report, our patrols
approached within 700 paces of the

"How can that be?" pressed Burrows. "One
, "And the same manifesto of President Wood
ruff declaring â¢. a . suspension ' of the polygamy
principle was a revelation, was It not?"-- â¢
Burrows directed a number of ques
tions to Smith' bearing upon the con
sistency of Smith's answers relating to
his belief and acceptance of the divine
revelations. He said:
. "I. understand you believe In'the revelation
of Joseph Smith 'Jr. in regard to polygamy
and still think It is right."
Smith said it was true.
Tayler asked:* "Do you so regard It? 1 ,'
"The command did not change my view on
the question of plural Â¦ marriage," - : he an
swered. "I believe plural marriages to be
right."
' Tayler then asked if it is true that
the revelation declaring plural mar
riage.8 remains in the books of author
ity as a part of the teachings of the
church.
BELIEVES IN MANIFESTO.
Tayler explained that he wanted to
Bhow that the demands of the church
are such that it might affect Smoofs
allegiance to the United States.
Wqrthlngton said thatthe line of
questioning was following out matters
dh which there was no dispute and
which are admitted by his client.
Burrows, ordered Tayler to proceed
with the case and the committee took
no notice of "Worthington's objection.
Continuing the inquiry in relation to
divine revelations, Tayler asked in re
gard to the, manifesto of President
Woodruff, in 1890, commanding a sus
pension of the requirement that polyg
amy be practiced in the church and
also the prayer for amnesty in 1891.
The questions were numerous and wen*
to ascertain whether the members of
the church considered these declara
tions affected the continuance of co
habitation of those previously married.
Smith said it was regarded that they
did affect such persons.
Beveridge Inquired concerning the
reasons for the line of questioning re
garding polygamy, as he said he un
derstood Smoot was not charged with
being a polygamist.
3IIGIIT AFFECT ALLEGIANCE.
In answer to a Question Smith said
that prior to 1862, when the plural mar
riages in the church were declared by
the church to be constitutional, polyg
amy had been practiced "in a limited
way."
Smith answered that the law question
was finally passed upon in 1889, and
that since that time he had no knowl
edge of any plural marriages taking
place.
At the afternoon session Smith was
again on the stand. Before proceed
ing Senator Hoar said he wanted to
understand one more point in regard
to the revelations and that was
whether women members of the
church were permitted to vote on
questions of acceptance or rejection of
revelations. Smith answered that
women voted on all of these matters.
It was brought out that the Su
preme Court decided in 1878 in the
Reynolds case that plural . marriages
as practiced in the Mormon church
are polygamous and Tayler asked
whether the church accepted that rul
ing of the Sunreme Court.
at 10:30 o'clock. An executive ses
sion of the committee was ordered to
determine on certain lines of conduct
ing the case.
That oath waa taken ' in 1900, and all the
evidence introduced thus far goes to show that
since that time the members of the hierarchy
have not been pledged to â¢ polygamy. Â¦ :Â¦
- The witness has been asked in regard to the
polygamous marriages of a certain Mr. Teas
dale, an apostle in the church. We have not
made objections before the testimony was tak
ing an irrelevant turn, because, we realize that
the practice of a court of Justice cannot obtain
In a committee hearing. But now an attempt
is being made to bring In testimony in regard
to the conduct : of this Teasdale some . fifteen,
twenty or thirty years ago* If you are trying
to prove merely that some members " of ' the
church have violated the laws of the land,
and judge Mr. Smoot from that point of view,
you might as well close the hearing now. '..-.
The committee went : into executive
session at 4 p. m. to determine the ad
visability of admitting the testimony.
It was finally decided, to allow special
latitude in the hearings.
Worthington, in reply to Tayler,
said that the charge that Senator
Smoot had taken an oath as apostle
which would be In conflict with his
oath to support the constitution of the
United States by reason of the fact
that the apostolic hierarchy was com
posed of men violating the laws of
polygamy, said: .
Smith said he was acquainted with
Lillian H. Hamlin, who was known
as the wife of Cannon, but that he had
never seen her before 1896.
Van Cott, on behalf of Senator
Smoot, made a protest against going
into the conduct of persons not inter
ested in the case and asking questions
which could have no bearing on it be
fore the committee. He referred to
questions which had been asked by
Senator Hoar concerning Smith's belief
and questions of Burrows in relation
to the inconsistency of his belief.
Van Cott declared that the State
laws protect a person In his belief, no
matter what the tendency of the belief,
so long as there Is no practice in vio
lation of law, and that therefore the
line of questioning was not reaching
any end. He read from Tayler's state
ment that Smoot was not charged with
any offense cognizable by law.
Tayler said he was pursuing the line
of Inquiry set out in the protest against
Smoot to the effect that the president
of the Mormon church and the major
ity of the twelve apostles were prac
ticing polygamy. He referred to Smith
as the dally associate and superior in
the church of Smoot, and said that
Smith is tho husband of five wives and
believes still in the principles of polyg
amy.
"Do you expect to prove In thatjeonnection
that the president and the twekre apostles
form a propaganda of polygamy?" asked Bev
erldge:
"We do," said Tayler.
"Then I think the course taken is perti
nent," said Bcveridge.
APOSTOLIC HIERARCHY.
Tayler asked a number of questions
relating to Abraham H. Cannon and
others of the Mormon faith in order
to bring out the witness* knowledge of
the question whether or not they were
polygamists and whether they had
married since the manifesto of 1890.
' VAX COTT ENTERS PROTEST.
"That Is right," subscribed Smith,
declares in favor of polygamy and the other
stops lt.' T
"I adhere to both In my belief." said Smith.
"I believe pblygamy was right, or I should
never have married more than one wife."
"As I understand It," Senator \Hoar Inter
rupted, "the last revelation does not prohibit
polygamy, .but merely suspends the former
principle commanding it. It may still be be
lieved that the practice Is Innocent and proper,
but as the divine command to continue it Is
stopped, the members of the "church submit to
the civil law on the question of plural mar
riages."
Smith, answered again that many
thousands in the church had declared
against the principle of plural mar
riage as given to the church In a reve
lation from Joseph, Smith Jr. To
bring out the effect of refusing- to sub
scribe to the- teachings of the church
Senator Hoar asked a' number .of
questions and Smith said: Â¦;
"The principle of revelation Is the funda
mental principle, of the church." "Â¦?
-â¢Â¦â¢â¢'Have- you ever received such a revelation
direct from God?" asked Mr. Tayler. '
"I notice that you say many thousands re
jected the doctrine of plural marriages. Do
you mean that they never practiced plural
marriages, or that they declared against the
doctrine?"
Senator Dubois remarked
"Not that I know of."
â¢ "Now, that lit Just what I have been calling
attention to." said Senator Hoar. "The wit
ness aajs, 'Xot that 1 know of.'-"
Turning to fcmith, he remarked that the an
swer exoresfled doubt, and more pointedly he
asked the witness: "Has the church ever re
jected any of your revelations? Have any of
the revelations to the presidents been re
jected?"
"May I say a word on that first?" asked
Smith. He stood up and was noticeably con
cerned at the trend of the questioning as he
replied: "The members of the Mormon church
arc among the freest, most independent people
of all the Christian denominations. They
have freedom of speech, freedom of thought.
They are not all united on every principle of
the church. They are not expected to be. They
are entitled to their own conception In- regard
to the principles of their church, their con-
Cf-rition of what appears to them to be tho
risht or the wrong. So long as one accepts
God end his opinion is not in conflict with
the accepted standards of the church he en
joys following the church. He who denies
God, he who commits adultery or steals or
lien or bears false witness against his neigh
bors in any -way or goes contrary to the car
dinal principles of our Christian religion. Is
compelled to withdraw. But one who is "hon
ect. virtuous, believes in God and haa a little
faith in our religion is nurtured, though he
may not believe in the church in all that
It teaches. In that book (Smith pointed to one
,of the volumes that had been Introduced
earlier in tho proceedings) is a revelation on
plural marriazes. Not 3 or 4 per cent of the
entire membership of the church have entereO
that state. All the rest have abstained from
plural marriages and many thousands have
rejected the principle- entirely." Â¦
FAVORS PLURAL MARRIAGES.
"May the members of the church say to you,
'We deny that God has told you to tell uu
that and we will not receive your revelation.'
Could that occur In the church?"
"It could." waa the reply.
"Has this ever been done?" asked Senator
Hoar.
REVELATIONS AKE ACCEPTED.
CHOSEN BY REVELATION.
Smith explained that the first presi
dency is the president of the church
and two high priests or counselors, and
that the twelve apostles are next in
authority.* The presidents are elected
by the council and apostles, but he be
lieved and it is taught that the presi
dents are really chosen by divine rev
elation and they are then endowed with
the authority of the holy priesthood
by authority direct from God. He said
the apostles might elect to their num
ber In the event of vacancy, but that
they would not go contrary to the wish
of the presidency.
In regard tc/ the revelations, the wit
ness said the church holas that any
elder may receive a revelation for his
own guidance.
"Mr. Smoot may receive a revelation
direct from God?" asked Tayler.
"For his own guidance, yes," -was the
answer.
In response 16 direct questioning
Smith said only those revelations to
the president which had been presented
to the church and accepted by Â¦ the
members were binding on them.
Overman wanted to know what hap
pened to those who did not believe in
the inspired revelations.
"Were they unchurched?" he asked.
"They unchurched themselves," was
the response.
After more direct questioning con
cerning the rights of the church mem
bers to reject revelations, Tayler put
the situation In this form:
and director or officer of a number of
mining companies. A list of first presi
dency or twelve apostles governing the
church \vas # read by Tayler and iden
tified by Smith. This list included the
name of Reed Smoot. '-'- ' â¢-
He said he was president of a num
ber of other small concerns, the names
of which he could not recall, and that
he is a. director, of the Union Pacific
Railway, Company, editor of the Im
provementer and Juvenile â¢â¢ Instructor
Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institute,
v/ith â¢ capital stock of more than $1,000,000;
Etate Bank of Utah. Zlon Savings Bank, Utah
Kugrar Company. Consolidated 'Wagon and Ma
chine Company, .Utah Light Railway Com
pany, Salt Lake and Los Angeles Railway
Company, f-'altair Beach : Company and Salt
Lake Knlttlnr Company.
The first question asked brought out
that Smith Is president of the church
and was born in Missouri in 183S, went
to Utah in 1848 and always has been in
the church.
Tayler asked Smith if he was a
prophet, seer and revelator.
The witness replied he was: "So sus
tained."
SMITH IS KEPT VERY BUSY.
Further questions along the same line
brought out the statement that he re
ceived his powers by reason of the po
sition he holds in the church. . , . ,
Questions directed to ascertain the
business occupation of Smith In addi
tion to the presidency of the church
brought out the following list of con
cerns of which he is president:
WASHINGTON, March 2.â An effort
to unearth secrets of the Mormon faith
was manifested in the first day's pro
ceedings before the Senate Committee
on Privileges and Elections which is in
vestigating the protests against Keed
Smoot retaining his seat as a Senator
from Utah. President Joseph F. Smith.
the highest official of the church, was
en the stand all day. He was ques
tioned closely in regard to the prin
ciples of divine revelations. He said
he adhered absolutely to all the teach
ings of the church in that regard and
that he himself had been visited with
divine inspiration from God directing
him as to details in matters pertaining
to the welfare of the church, though na
angels had come to him as in the case
of the revelation to his uncle, Joseph
Smith Jr., the founder of the church.
He subscribed to the standard of au
thority for the church in relation to the
revelation commanding polygamy as
made known to the first president in k
visit from "an angel in black." He also
said he still be'leved in polygamy.
The testimony was directed in a slight
degree at Senator Smoot and no at
tempt was made by the defense to cur
tail the admission of testimony until
President Smith was questioned in re
lation to Dolvgamous conduct of cer
tain officials of the church before the
manifesto of 1S90. The attorneys then
objected and much time was devoted to
the testimony. The committee then
went into executive session and after
a full discussion determined to allow
the utmost latitude to the hearings,
which means that court practices will
be a\'oided. The protestants sa^d they
regarded th!? as a victory for them
The committee will hear practically ail
the prosecution has to offer -and de
termine Itself what is competent.
At an executive session of the com
mittee following the afternoon hearing
it was decided to meet every day at
10:S0 a. m. and remain in session until
12 noon, meeting again at 2 p. m. and
continuing throughout the afternoon.
Five members, including the chairman,
will constitute a Quorum.
PRESIDENT SMITH IS CATTED.
The attorneys for the defense, A- S.
Worthlngton of this city and Waldemar
Van Cott of Salt Lake, Utah, arrived
early and engaged in consultation with
their client. J. G. Carlisle, former Sec
retary of the Treasury, and R. W. Tay
ler, former Representative in Congress
and the attorney who prosecuted the
successful contest against Brigham
Roberts retaining his seat in Congress,
on the ground of his violating the anti
polygamy law, are the counsel for the
protestants. Half a dozen witnesses,
nearly all of them officials of the Mor
mon church, occupied seats in the rear
of the large committee room.
Tayler announced his readiness to
proceed and asked that President
Joseph F. Smith be sworn.
DENVER, Colo., March 2.âAttor
ney General Miller to-day received no
tice from the Attorney General of the
United States that he will make appli
cation March 14 to the Supreme Court
of the United States for permission to
Intervene in the Kansas-Colorado suit
concerning the use of the Arkansas
River waters. This action on the part
of the Federal Government was a com
plete surprise to the Colorado officers.
Colorado's contention that no State nor
the United States has any power to
say what shall be done with waters
that rise in Colorado is opposed by
the Attorney General of the United
States, Miller said, only as regards the
General Government, which will in
sist on its water priorities. Otherwise,
according to Miller's claim, the posi
tion of the United States is favorable
to Colorado.

Th.e -debate was participated in by

pretation of the preferences of Secre
tary 'Taft. recently Governor of the
Philippines. It was stated thet he had
oxprrfsed a willingness that the pro
posed law should be enacted in case
ttie tariff .on Philippine products was
revised. It ' was intimated that the
tariff reclultion could be accomplished
"by the ejiort session of Congress, but
C'armack contended that in a short
session this would be impossible.
â¢PajtcrFon accepted the suggestion of
a " revision of the Philippine tariff as
a'' threat- of another raid on sugar and
tobacco/ and : said the friends of the
and tobacco industries would re
fis.f- f very effort of that kind by all
If gitimate parliamentary tactics. He
predicted that a bill of the kind. If an
administration measure and presented
by Lodge, would receive the unanimous
support of the Republican eide.

cut interrupted to say, and Patterson
replied that it had been uniformly so
in the past. Plait raid, however, that

ation at; the afternoon session. Car

' WASHINGTON, March 2.â The bill
for the regulation of Philippine ship
ping wes again the principal subject
of -consideration, by the Senate to-day.
It v/as amended bo as to defer for a
.year lhe time when the bill shall take
effect.
It is pointed out that it is not urged
by the President that all the people, in
cluding Indians, in the Indian Territory
shall be admitted as citizens immedi
ately, but that gradually, as the In
dians become -qualified for citizenship,
they may be accorded the rights of
citizenship and that eventually, per
haps the Indian Territory may be made
into a seoerate State.
WASHINGTON, March 2.â President
Roosevelt In the last week has had
several conferences with Senators and
Congressmen who are Interested in the
proposition to create new States. It is
believed to be the President's solution
of the problem that two new States be
created, one from Oklahoma and the
Indian Territory and one from the ter
ritories of New Mexico and Arizona.
In this respect he is in agreement, at
least so far as Oklahoma and the In
dian Territory are concerned, with the
Senate Committee on Territories. The
idea of the creation of only two States
does not meet the approval of the peo
ple in the Territories, and their objec
tion to it may delay statehood legisla
tion.

At this point Bailay said he assumed
that all of the testimony being
brought out in regard to the-x^ligion
of Mormonism had some sound rela
tion to the influence of the church In
civil affairs and that unless 'he was
assured of that he would object.
QUESTIONS RIGHT OP INQUIRY.
- "For my part," he said, "I do not
think Congress has anything to do
with rellsious affairs."
TayJer answered that the prosecu
tion would attempt to show that the
church directed affairs of state, poli
tics and, in fact, all matters, and con
sequently the method of procedure
was necessary. No further objection
was made.
The committee then adjourned until
2 p. m. and Burrows announced that
hereafter the hearings would be held

Smith described the accepted the
ory of the revelation of the principle

but that he had received direct reve
lation from God by inspiration.
"By inspiration."
"J uevjr said I had received a revelation,

NEW YORK, March 2. â Fourteen
persons are believed to have been
killed, of whom the bodies of only five
have been recovered; about a score
injured and , several are missing,
through the collapse to-day of the
steel skeleton of the Hotel Darlington,
a twelve-story apartment-house in
course of erection at 67 West Forty
sixth street. The steel framework had
been* erected as far as the eleventh
floor, and the structure was swarming
with ironworkers, masons and labor
ers when, without an instant's warn
ing, the upper floor sagged and col
lapsed, and the whole structure fell
with a crash that was heard for
blocks and shook all the buildings in
the vicinity. A portion of the steel
frame fell upon the rear of the Hotel
Patterson, on West Forty - seventh
street, crushing in the wall of the
dining-room and killing Mrs. Ella
Lacey Storrs, wife of Frank Storrs, a
wealthy resident of Rye, Westchester
County, as she was sitting at luncheon
with the wife of Rev. Dr. Minbt
Savage, who escaped unhurt.
The other bodies so far recovered
are Frederick Morrills, foreman of the
Roebling Construction Company; Far
rell I. Fagan, a derrickman, and two
unidentified men, apparently laborers.
The more seriously injured, with one
exception, are laborers on the building,
and are:
Joseph SInto, Andrew Maher, James
W. Smith, Henry Strobe, Tony Smith,
Dennis McGinnis, Frederick Weissen
muller, Gottlieb Witterau, A.V. Benter,
Joseph Gentry and Ernest Meier, a
waiter employed in the Hotel Patter
son. .
SEVERAL ARE MISSING.
Among those missing is Frank J.
Allison of the Allison Realty, Company,
the builders of the hotel, who is known
to have been in the building' when it
fell. Efforts to recover the bodies^of
the dead and rescue those imprisoned
In the wreck were begun by the fire
men Immediately after the crash, and
at 11 o'clock to-night the contractor
in charge of the wrecking work said
that his men had discovered seven bod
ies and that two were known to be
pinned under the wreckage on the east
side of the building. J
The cause of the accident was the
overloading of the floors. Foreman
James Halpin, in charge of the iron
workers, stated that there was a large
quantity of cement and other building
material on the fifth floor and on the
ninth floor were eighty-three beams
which were to have been used in con
structing the remaining floors of the
building.
That criminal carelessness is charge
able to somebody is shown by the fact
that the building department had
placed repeated against
the building, the"- last one being filed
to-day, at the instance of Inspector
Charles French, because "the side walls
were more than two stories in advance
of the front walls, and the floor beams
were not properly bolted and tied."
RECEIVED MAXY WARNINGS.
In spite of this and previous warn
ings those responsible for the construc
tion of the building went ahead regard
less of consequences.
Adjoining the collapsed building on
the west side is the four-story brown
stone residence of Harold Brown.
Some of the huge iron beams struck the
side of the house and drove holes in the
walls and roof and destroyed a part
of the brownstone front, which was
thrown to the street. The occupants,
escaped uninjured. On the east side is
a house occupied- by a school for boys.
The pupils had gone home td lunch a
few minutes before the crash occurred.
Some of the beams struck the house,
tearing off a portion of the roof and
smashing holes in the side walls. Mrs.
Storrs was sitting at lunch with Mrs.
Savage when the crash came, and she
and Meier, the waiter, were buried un
der the debris of the. roof and walls.
Mrs. Savage barely escaped being
struck, but her skirt was pinned to the
floor by a mass of fallen bricks. Mrs.
Storrs was breathing when extricated,
but died within a few minutes. The
waiter is believed to be fatally Injured.
The other occupants of the dining
room escaped unhurt.
The Hotel Patterson was shaken to
its foundation and the .flre es
capes on several stories were torn
from the fastenings and all the win
dows on these floors were \ smashed.
The occupants of these apartments
hastily quitted. them. Rev. Minot Sav-f
age was ill in his apartment in the
front of the hotel at the time of the
collapse. The ' plans for the building
were filed by the firm of Neville &
Bagge, architects, and called for the
construction of* a fireproof ; building/
twelve stories in height, with a front
age of 55 ;' feet and a depth of "100. of
steel, brick and stone, of a height when
finished of '- 199 feet. The approximate
building cost, exclusive of the plat, was
named at $350,000.
Arrested for Stealing Beer.
CALISTOGA', March 2.â Acting
night watchman Clarence Smith was
arrested here- last night "by Constable
Fosson a charge of burglary. . He en
tered the liquor store* of D. C. Wills
arid .was caught in the act of taking
two /bottles of beer. When arrested
Smith was struck' on the- head by .Wills
several times with a ; heavy- revolver,
which inflicted a severe" scalp wound.'
The town of Alturas was covered
with a sheet of water, in some por
tions attaining a depth of four or five
feet. Families along the river were
compelled to abandon their homes,
while on the first evening of the flood
the water backed up into the electric
light plant, extinguishing the flres in
the furnaces and left the town in to
tal darkness.
The estimated loss of stock on the
range is appalling. The winds which
brought rains into the valleys and on
the foothills left a heavy fall of snow
in the mountains. On the winter
range north of Canby In this county
is a fall of three or four feet of snow
on the level. Fifteen hundred or two
thousand head of horses are wintering
there, as the feed is good, except when
rendered unobtainable by such heavy
snows. Cattlemen have been trying
to break trails into this vicinity In or
der to rescue these poor animals, but
without success, as their efforts were
ever thwarted by continually falling
and drifting snow. It is estimated by
the stockmen that they cannot pos
sibly save more than half of all this
vast herd under most favorable
weather now, and that if the storms
do not cease immediately all will be
lost. '
ALTURAS, March 2. â The recent
floods here have been the highest In
years. Streams everywhere were be
yond the control of their banks and
considerable damage was done.
Bridges and dams are washed away,
while mountain roads are ruined by
torrents, either being cut away so as
to be impassable or covered with de

The message also stated that the
flood was headed south toward Stock
ton and would probably take every
thing in its way as far as the Cala
veras River. This afternoon the steam
barge Wright came up the channel
with 1800 sheep rescued from the
levee of Staten Island. The Wright's
captain stated that water was seep
ing fast into Bouldin Island and that
there was no hope. At 4 o'clock this
afternoon the crest of the flood and
the tide surged against the Bouldin
Island levees. Hundreds of men were
stationed at the threatened points to
give battle to the enemy. Prepara
tions had been made to remove such
property as could be transported in
case of a flood. Three distinct breaks
have occurred since and a small army
of men was rushed to the points where
the water had started over. By the
use of sand bags and shovels the men
held the water in check until stronger
supports could be thrown up. For a
half hour it looked as if the entire
island would be annexed to the In
land sea, but the workers finally tri
umphed and the falling tide left the
island dry- To-night a force of sev
eral hundred men is at work prepar
ing for the supreme test which is ex
pected at midnight when the tide
comes in.
Although there is considerable
alarm here to'-hight it is not believed
that the water will approach this city
on the north nearer than the Cala
veras, as the broken levees below have
provided an escape for the flood. The
situation is liable to change, how
ever, as it Is not known what volume
is yet to come down the Sacramento.
One thousand dollars was offered by
island residents this morning for a
steamer for one day, and the offer had
to be refused, for # there was not a
steamer available.
"Send us a steamer, or a launch and
a barge at any cost," was the message
that came to this city early this morn
ing from the Sargent tract, near Term
inous. "Can you go up the canal to the
Sargent canal farm and rescue stock
and beans from the levee?" was asked
this morning of the captain of the
steamer Jersey.
"I would . not attempt to take a
Bteamer up that canal for what the
boat cost new.. She would be swept
on .the top of the levee and capsized
as sure as fate," came back the answer.

STOCKTOX, March. 2. â Many thou
sand acres of the richest land in this
county, about one-flfteenth of its total
area, was under water at nightfall this
evening:. One million dollars is a con
servative estimate of the loss that falls
on owners and renters of reclaimed
lands. Unsatisfied and unchecked by
the vast area swallowed up yesterday,
the great flood that has come down
the Sacramento River and rolled into
San Joaquin County made further en
croachments and to-night it was fear
ed by the more timid that the surging
waters may leap the Calaveras, four
'miles north of this city, and overflow
Stockton before twenty-four hours
have passed. This afternoon came the
report that the great Terminus tract
had been added to the inland lake, and
later a message was received from
Antioch stating that Sherman Island
of 12,000 acres was flooding from large
breaks in the levee and that the water
at high tide at Antioch to-day was
nearly a foot higher than it was yes
terday. Sherman Island is not in this
county, but its levees made barriers
that are hourly growing fewer be
tween the delta of the Sacramento,
llokelumne and Calaveras.
M. D. Eaton of Eaton & Buckley,
who are extensively interested in the
Terminus tract, went out there this
morning. Shortly before 3 o'clock this
afternoon he telephoned to Buckley
that the levee had given way and that
the flood was rushing in on the tract.
He demanded that a steamer be sent
at once and added that he feared all
of the residents of the tract might not
escape.

last night:

Walrrut Grove is situated, are deemed
the -finest pasture and grain lands in

The reclamations on .the south side
of the San Joaquin River are safe. The
water about Victoria, Union and Rob
erts islands and the Jones and other
nearby tracts has raised very little and
there is no possibility of a flood in that
section.
It is stated that when the Staten Isl
and levees gave way the flood came
down in a big, high wave and took
houses and barns and swept them
across the island, smashing them
against the levee on the west side.
*'When morning came we found a
rowboat and sent a man for help. I
think he went to Bouldin Island. Last
evening the steamer Jersey came and
took us off, all but a few of the men,
who ctayed to watch the stock.
"Yesterday a man came v over in a
boat from Staten Island. He said that
the people of that district did not have
time to save food and he wanted to
borrow some. He said there were near
ly a hundred families camped on the*
levee over there."
"We made a camp on the levee. Fif
teen or twenty families got together
and we built a flre and made coffee.
The water came almost to the top of
the levee and we believed that we
would all be drowned.^. Once the levee
below us gave way With a roar and
the water poured ..through into the riv
er, which was lower than the water in
side the levee. It made an awful noise
there in the night. We fully thought
that the end was coming. The most
of our stock ran for the levee when the
flood came.
This morning some fifteen or twenty
men stood^in a dejected group on the
south wharf in this city, awaiting the
arrival of the steamer Jersey. They
had been tenant farmers on the Brack
tract and had accompanied their wlvei
and children to this city on the Jersey
last night. They were waiting to be
taken back so that they could help save
a part of their belongings. There were
between sixty and seventy persons liv
ing on the Brack tract, and all were
renters. Last Monday they were told
that there was a possibility of the levee
giving way, but they did not heed the
warning. It was nearly midnight when
the wild alarm was sounded that the
flood was coming.
"I could hear the men shouting and
I knew what it meant," said J. J.
Pimentel'in telling of his experience.
"I told my wife to get the babies and
some food ready, while I ran to the
barn and hooked up my best team to
the lightest wagqn. Before I could
drive to the door of our house the
flood was there. It did not come grad
ually, but swept down with a wave
more than a foot high. We did not
have time to dress the children. We
threw them, bedclothes and all, into
the bottom of the wagon, tossed in a
little food and scrambled in ourselves.
The water was then up to the hubs.
I lashed the horses into a gallop and
by the time we reached the levee the
water was coming into the bed of the
wagon.

DON'T RISK A PENNY.
GET WELL FIRST.
For SA years I've been a. physician!
Â¦Â¦ ' I hav* treated nearly two million
Â¦ i-ascs!
â¢ â¢ Surely you'll admit that such experi-
ence must have taught me some certain-
, tirs.
â¢ ' And â all that I know of disease and
< ; -jreâ all that I have proven to be worth
" knowing â 4s condensed into my six books
ior the Sick.
. _ Write for a free copy to-<lay.
They -tell of my great discovery that
" practically all diseases can be perma-
nently cured through the Sympathetic
Â¦ Xerves.
Xot <he nerves we feel with, see with,
â¢Hear with, but the inside nerves.
It is these that unconsciously operate
the vital Organsâ the Heart, Liver, Kid-
neys. Brain., etc.
: â¢ XVhen the inside nerves get run down,
.that Orpan which is weakest in the body
lop? s its power to act properly.
It then throws its work upon the other
Organs.
. These Organs in turn become affected
t-hrough over work, and so, scarcely any
. case is found without complications.
" I proved it useless to doctor tiie indi-
vidual Organs themselves while the
Nerve-power to fully operate them was
larking.
Sedatives temporarily deadened the
pain, but increased the distress after-
â¢ wards.
' - Tonics revived the drooping powers,
Â«>nly to insure relapse so soon as the
5timulus was withdrawn.
Â¦.Of what use to hourly move ahead the
hands of a watch if its mainspring be
seriously weakened?
There is but one sensible thing to do,
viz. â stiffen up the mainspring:.
That if? what my. now famous, pre-
scription â Dr. Snoop's Restorative
docs. . /
It acts directly upon the Sympathetic
>>rve Centers just as steam acts in an
â¢En'gine.
It provides, through these inside
. nerves. thÂ»> power -to make the weakest
â¢ <irfran do its duty. . -
] t enables weak organs to cast " off
. their clogging waste matter and to re-
pair their worn tissue.
It runs the human mill, at full capa-
'â¢â¢â¢ity. till that mill- produces enough new
material to keep itself running without
" further help.
So sure am I of this Restorative that
. T authorize certain. Druggists everywhere

Could anything better prove my faith
in this system than this voluntary test?
Could anyone furnish you better

Captain Peyton C. March of the gen
eral staff, one of the United States
military attaches to the Japanese ar/ny,
arrived yesterday from Washington
and is at the Occidental. The other
American soldiers who will accompany
the Mikado's troops are Colonel Enoch
H. Cfowder, Judge advocate United
States army and member of the gen
eral staff; Captain John F. Morrison,
Twentieth Infantry, now stationed at
Manila, and Captain Joseph E. Kuhn,
Engineer Corps, also stationed at
Manila, These . appointments were
made by General Adna R. Chaffee.
â¢Colonel Crowder will be here to-day.
With Captain March he will sail Satur
day on the steamship Doric for Tokio,
where they will be Joined by Captains
Morrison and Kuhn.' On arrival there
they will report to Minister Griscom,
who will in turn conduct them to the
chief of the War Department, who will
then assign them to the divisions they
will accompany through the war.
Colonel Crowder will have general su
perlntendency over the' party.
The Japanese Government will supply
the American officers with every facility
for noting as observers the different
movements In which the Japanese
armies will engage. It will be the duty
of these representatives of our Govern
ment to cable to the War Department
at Washington news of big battles and
to compile official reports upon these
actions. Daily bulletins will be for
warded through the mails.
Captain March is well known in army
circles. He graduated from West Point
in 1SSS. He is thoroughly conversant
with the situation in the Far East. He
has been twice to the Philippines. The
first time he went in command of the
Aetor Battery. He also served there as
lieutenant colonel in the Thirty-third
Volunteer Infantry. Captain March
has been stationed at the Presidio, Fort
Mason and other points. In speaking
of his present detail Captain March
said:
"I am greatly pleased to have been
chosen as one of the four officers to
be sent on this service. We expect to
gain a great deal of valuable informa
tion, as we are to have every facility
offered us by the Japanese Govern
ment for observing and noting means
and methods of warfare. I think it
will be a long war and a fight, to the
finish. Of course, we all know of Rus
sia's great army, but only those who
have been In the Orient and are well
acquainted with the Japanese people
can understand what a remarkable
and wonderful race they are. They
are thoroughly equipped for this war.
They are a very tenacious people, and,
from what I know of them, they, will
never be bulldozed Into making any
concessions, but will fight for their
rights to the end. Their greatest
power, perhaps, lies in the very fact
that to a unit they are of the same
opinion in regard toj the stand their
country has taken toward Russia.
"The Russians, df course, are equal
ly obdurate and possess equal
amount of stubbornness. Both being
of unyielding disposition, neither will
give, but will fight until the last
resource is gone.
"I am prepared to remain away at
least a year and a half. Other Gov
ernments will have the same facilities
as ourselves and will undoubtedly send
attaches. Two of England's represen
tatives are at present in this country
and I expect they will arrive here In
time to will on the Doric. They are

eral, and Captain Haldore, head of the

'Then came an elucidation of women's
rights and duties under the laws of
California, and the women went home
happy on learning from the lawyer all
the privileges they were enjoying,
without knowing it: also that they pos
sessed their privileges without the cor
relative "duties of citizenship. "But,"
said the club oracle, "the gentleman
didn't speak of the taxes we women
are* permitted to payâand without rep
resentation. Wasn't that what the
colonies raised such a row about?"
Notwithstanding this diplomatic
omission the talk was a rare treat.
Here's to Mr. Ford as a club talker.
May we hear him again.
The lecture was followed by three
well rendered dialect stories by Miss
Noonan, after which the hero of the
day partook of a fe\v cups of club tea.

ing one of the best teams in the East.
The railroad magnate plays polo
whenever the opportunity offers. The
game, he said, greatly Interests him
and consequently affords him a splen
did chance to get much needed exer
cise and recreation.
The party expecjs to leave some
time to-day for the East. -
The speaker then traced the spirit
of feminine progress through the Med
iterranean nations, on through the
days of old Englandâ where a husband
couldn't, under the law, beat his wife
with a stick any thicker than his
thumb â across the seas to America,
where "the laws of witchcraft and
sorcery followed the Pilgrims to Ply
mouth Rock, and the spirit of the
Scarlet Letter lived through the colo
nial days."
Tirey L. Ford, clubman and United
Railroads attorney, has always been
suspected of cleverness In the amicable
adjustment of strikes, of wisdom in
dispensing advice to carmen and of
strategy in averting damage cases
against his company, but his dearest
foe knew not that h<Â» had surpassed
the achievements that fall to the lot
of ordinary men, and had become the
petâ nay, the heroâ of the clubwomen
of San Francisco. And. mark ye. men
folk, how 'twas done: The Forum
Club, presided over by Mrs. Henry
Payot, extended an invitation to Mr.
Ford, by virtue of his legal knowledge,
to address the club upon a legal topic
of interest to women, and he chose the
clever subject, "The Lady and the
Law." And therein he made the hit of
his life! In fact, fancy and in gal
lantry, the address easily leads the
field of this month's unillustrated club
talks.
He outlined the progress of woman's
social and legal position thusly:
"With the dawn of civilization came
the first faint, feeble and halting recog
nition of woman's rightful station.
Thence on through the ages as civiliza
tion advanced, woman gradually rose
from the humble servitor of man to be
his proud equal and his household
queen. But the process was slow. The
Chaldeans framed the flrst code of
laws of which we have any knowledge
that gave to woman a legal and Indi
vidual status. But she was still in
bondage to the whims of men. Moses
gave to the Hebrew world a marvel
ous code of laws, but under its pro
visions the husband alone had the priv
ilege of divorce, and daughters could
not Inherit except in the absence of
sons, and then the daughter must
marry in her tribe."
By Snllle Sharp.
Â¦ Mr. " Gould and his two. sons are
great polo players,: a fact ; which he ia
seemingly proud 1 of, and" he laugh
ingly . that the trio, ' s with
"Ben" Nlcoll, prided themselves on be-
"I have been deeply impressed with
the 'indications of prosperity In your
State." continued Mr. Gould. "The
modern. character of the Southern Pa
cific "and j the " Santa Fe roads is ' very
noticeable to the experienced railroad
man and their equipment would be a
credit to any of the big Western lines."
FRIENDLY WITH HARRIMANY
Referring to his business relations
with E. H. Harriman of the Southern
Pacific and Union Pacific railroads,
Mr. Gould remarked that he and Mr.
Harriman a**e on the best of terms.-
The Southern Pacific connections with
the Gould and other roads to the West,
he said, were eminently, satisfactory
and he could see no reason why he
should contemplate an invasion of the
coast territory so long as these pleas
ant, relations continued. The same
statement, he kidded, would apply- to
the Santa Fe qonnections. He stated
that the .Wabash road. expected to' get
into Pittsburg by the middle of April
and that a great deal, of ; money is be
ing, spent to accomplish this work.
He has already arranged for an exten
sion of his railroad interests eastward
from Pittsburg to tidewater in Balti
more'and he remarked that the West
ern" Maryland . road would probably be
the nucleus of that extension.
"My trip to the coast," . said Mr.
Gould to the newspaper representa
tives, "was mainly for the purpose of
inspection. My family preceded me to
Southern California, where I joined
them and hoped to remain for some
time, but urgent business has called
me East again, and we decided to start
thither by way ; of San Francisco,
which I have not visited for a number
of years. I was pleasantly surprised at
the splendid condition of business af
fairs I found west of St. Louis, a fact
which I attribute to the fine crops of
last fall. In the East there was a se-.
rious depression and a slump in securi
ties, which has left a bad effect there,
but fortunately it did not extend to the
West. Business, so far as railroads
are concerned, could not have been bet
ter. All the available equipment of our
roads is being used, and I believe that
the other roads are enjoying the same
prosperity." ,
When asked regarding the frequent
reports that he is behind the Western
Pacific Railroad project, Mr. Gould,
with an air that would readily suggest
that he had tired answering the ques
tion, replied: "Not a cent of my money
is involved in that enterprise, and I
have never had any intentiornof invest
ing in it. I am not directly or indi
rectly interested in the road, and I am
certain that none of my business asso
ciates are."
George J. Gould, president of the" great
Gould systei.i of railroads, accom
panied by the members of his family
and several railway officials and
friends, arrived in this city from the
south at 8:30 o'clock last evening in
a special train, composed of four cars.
The party has been making a tour of
the Southern and Southwestern States
and left San Diego yes terday, stopping
over at Santa .Barbara for a few
hours and then proceeding on to this
city. Among the male members of Mr.
Gould's party are his two sons, Jay
and Kingdom their tutor, O. B. Hunts
man: Benjamin Nic-Il, a prominent
steel operator of New York; L. S.
Thome, vice president and general
manager of the Texas and Pacific Rail
road; E. T. Jeffery, president of the
Denver and Rio Grande Railroad; Le

sengers. They were met at Third and
Townsend streets by W. J. Shotwell.
general agent of the Gould lines, and
by him later shown through the main
portion of the city and escorted on a
trip through Chinatown.

The officials of the United States em

of the canal company that there is
nothing now in the way of the actual
transference of the ; concession and the
company's property. At recent confer
ences between Embassador Porter and
President Bo of the canal company, the
President pointed out I'.at two suits
are now pendingâ one involving Colom
bia's right to hold shares and the other
the general question of the company's
right to transfer its concession to the
United States. .
M. Bo was inclined to believe one
and perhapsjboth suits might be pro
tracted several months, but' General
Porter was satisfied, after hearing M.
Bo, that even if the suits are continued
they do not constitute any menace to
the United States, requiring putting off
the transfer. If this view prevails at
Washington it is expected that the
details of the transfer will soon be ar
ranged through the canal
representatives there.
WASHINGTON, March 2.â A con

to the Panama canal property is In
sight. Within thirty days, perhaps in
a shorter time, the United States will
be In full possession of the property,
and the money consideration will have

Attorney General Knox said to-day:
There are many drugstores in the
vicinity of California and Devisadero
streets, but at Hoover's, on the north
west corner of the street crossing
named," it was denied last evening that
any such young woman had applied
there for information as to a physician
who would treat her case. Dr. Ward
said last night that he knew of no phy
sician named Winslo'w in San Fran
cisco. The city directory gives no such
name in its list of physicians. | .....
Mr. Merchant, in whose family the
young woman's sister' lives, declined
last evening to disclose the name of the
missing girl or to give any information
that would assist in locating her.
The police are working on a new
mystery and as usual are doing all
they can to increase the difficulty of
its solution.
Last week a young Swedish woman
came to this city to visit her sister, a
domestic in the family of B. D. Mer
chant at 928 Van Ness avenue. Her
home is said to be in San Jose, where
the Merchants lived until about four
months ago. The young woman's
throat was ailing, and on Thursday
she called at a drug store to ask
where she could find a physician to
treat her complaint. According to her
statement made later to -her sister,
the Merchants' servant, this drug
store was somewhere in the vicinity
of Devisadero end California streets,
and she was there advised to consult
a certain "Dr.^Wirislow" at an address
which the sister cannot now recall.
On Friday afternoon she left her sis
ter at the Merchants' home,, saying
she was going out to consult Dr. "Win
slow. She has' not been seen since
and no word from or regarding her
has been received by her friends.
Mrs. Merchant communicated the
facts of the case yesterday to Dr.
James "W. Ward, the president of the
Health Board,\/and on his advice she
reported the matter to the police. De
tectives were at once assigned to work
on the mystery, but as yet they have
found no trace of the missing woman.
At police headquarters every precau
tion is being taken to keep the facts
secret.
Levinson was just closing the sajoon
for the night and was in the act of
turning out the lights, when two men
with handkerchiefs over their faces
ran up to him and. covering him wit:h.
their revolvers, ordered him to throw
up his hands.
Before Levinson was fully aware of
what had transpired he was .relieved
of two purses, the contents of which
amounted to about $40 in coin. He was
then thrust into the lavatory and the
door locked. He drew his revolver and
fired three shots into the' celling to at
tract attention.
Dan Cunaso, who runs' a tamale
stand next door to the Levmson place,
heard the shots and hurried to the aid
of the prisoner. The men had already
made their escape and no arrests have
been made. >V-'-V Â¦'Â¦â¢'
Levinson says that earlier in the
evening a man dressed as a sailor of
the navy, but who had anything but
a nautical bearing, loafed around, the
bar, and, he believes, sized up- tfre
chances for a good haul. The sup
posed sailor was slovenly in appear
ance and had three or four days"
growth of beard. Levinson. says that
he believes the sailor's costume was
merely a disguise.

The report that Japanese had landed at Possiet Bay for an In
vasion of Northern Jlanchurla is explained, seemingly, by a tele
gram from Vladivostok, which reports that about 2400 Japanese
have debarked on the northern coast of Korea and are threatening
Ilunchun, a Manchurian town not far from Vladivostok.
Martial law has been proclaimed In fifty-three Russian prov
inces, owing to the attitude of the peasant classes, which arc on the
verge revolution.
A^peace movement has been begun in France. It is believed
that Russia would welcome the mediation of the powers and it is
hoped by the promoters of the movement that the United States
can be induced to take the lead with a proffer of its good offices.
In a desire to accord fair treatment in its news columns to the
belligerents in the present conflict, The. Call to-day presents the
historical record of Russia's friendship for the United States dur
ing the Civil War. A controversy on this subject is being waged in
the Eastern, press, as a result or the statement by a prominent fin
ancier that the scope "and intent of Russia's action during the 60's
had been exaggerated.
Japan lms made a complete change In her plan of campaign,
and for a brief period Port Arthur will be granted a respite from
the rigors of war,, except such as" may be incidental â¢ to, a reported
shortage of provisions. " ~ A ' land investment of the stronghold will not
be attempted for at least a fortnight, and during the last four days
even the Japanese fleet has disappeared froni the vicinity of IJao
trfng Peninsula. It' is to be doubted, however, that Admiral Togo
has withdrawn to a great distance, as he is not likely to give the
"bottled up" Russian warships an opportunity for escape. Perhaps
the crafty naval hero of the Mikado's empire has retired simply
with the hope of luring Admiral Stark away from the protection of
the powerfnl land batteries of Port Arthur. '
' . Japan's decision to temporarily cease the attacks upon Port Ar
thur Is made for the reason that for the next few days her activity
will center in the ad\*ance of the army' now In Korea toward the
Yalu River, where it will battle with the Russian land forces for
the command of the frontier. Should the Russians be defeated and
driven back, the cutting off of Port Arthur from its base of supplies
and reinforcements, would be an easy matter and the downfall of
the stronghold would be practically assured. Japanese troops to
the number of 120,000 are now nearing the Yalu and the flrst great
land battle cannot- -long be -delayed.
* St. Petersburg has been, stirred, by, a rumor that Port Arthur
is to be abandoned, the Russians, retreating northward in Manchu
ria. Newspapers which are regarded as semi-official are presenting
reasons for such a move, which indicates that it is receiving strong
consideration in Governrhent circles.

haying been charged with assault with
Intent" to commit murder. His plea
was Insanity, due to drink. There was

which is two years in the penitentiary
and $5000 fine. After the verdict was

WASHINGTON, March 2.â The land
ing in force of the Japanese on Liao
tung peninsula and the beginning of
the land investment of Port Arthur will
not begin for a fortnight, according to
advices received here from what are
believed to.be reliable sources. It was
expected that the attack upon the
fortress would take place yesterday or
to-day, but these latter advices, with
out explaining the reason for the de
lay, show that there has been a change
in the original plans.
Army officers here believe that the
Japanese have decided that, with the
railroad connecting Port Arthur with
the outside world cut, thus preventing
supplies reaching the place, two weeks'
privation will render the final assault
easier. Moreover, as Port Arthur can
be safely left as it is for the time being,
the Japanese troops may be employed
instead "in Northern Korea and near
the Yalu River, where they are now
most needed.
Washington Learns
of Japan's. Change
of Plan.
An official of the Foreign Office
pointed put to-day the erroneous im
pression prevailing abroad that Rus
sian newspapers, owing to the censor
ship exercised over the news, expressed
only views sanctioned by the authori
ties, whereas, as a matter of fact, the
newspapers editorially have the widest
latitude and frequently embarrass the
Government by their unrestrained
criticism of other countries.
The correction of the original version
of the Vicksburg incident at Chemulpo
has already affected Russian . public
opinion favorably. The report of Com
mander Marshall, captain of the Vicks
burg, has been communicated to For
eign Minister Lamsdorff by United
States Embassador McCormick, and
the formal* thanks of the Russian Ad
miralty will be tendered as soon as a
detailed report Is received from the
captain of the Variag.
t The Foreign Office points out that
the view held in Washington, regard
ing foodstuffs as contraband of war,
agrees with theirs, if such foodstuffs
are destined for private individuals.
A difficulty will be to determine the ul
timate destination of such material. It
might be consigned to private parties,
but eventually reach the military Gov
ernment. The Foreign Office holds that
foodstuffs shipped in large
are subject to suspicion, as this would
be prima facie evidence that ' the ma
terial was designed for the use of the
military.
ST. PETERSBURG", March 2.â The
Russian Government earnestly desires
the conservation of the ancient friend
ship between the United States and
the empire. The opinion is expressed
here that the two countries are now on
the eve of a better understanding of
the points concerning which differ
ences have existed. The campaign of
recrimination, which is progressing' In
a portion of the press of both coun
tries, is deprecated, and the Govern
ment here specifically disavows respon
sibility for the utterances of some Rus
sian newspapers against the United
States, which In turn have Inflamed a
portion of the American press against
Russia.
GRIFFITH JURY
FINDS VERDICT
, Shipping men cannot figure how the
Northeast Siberian Company could af
ford to pay 5600,000 spot cash for the
steamships purchased.
The sale of the steamships does not
affect trans-Pacific traffic. 1 which for
two years has been handled chiefly by
three lines out of Tacoma, which ope
rate, larger steamships.

A young sea captain residing in Ta
coma says that a month ago he was
approached by an agent of the pur
chasing company and asked if he could

TACOMA, March 2.â The Northern
Pacific's trans-Pacific steamships Ta
coma, Victoria and Olympia have been
sold to John Rosene, manager of the
Northeastern Siberian Company, which
holds important mining and commer
cial concessions covering Eastern* Sibe
ria from the Russian Government. In
this enterprise Rosene is a partner of
Ferdinand Peck, fcfrmer Minister In St.
Petersburg. The fact that' Rosene has
recently returned from St. Petersburg
and the further fact that so much ton
nage is not needed in the trade of Cape
Nome and the northern coast of Siberia
leads to the supposition that he is act
ing as agent for the Russian Govern
ment. The belief exists among ship
ping men that the steamships will be
used In transporting supplies, forage
and possibly ammunition by the North
ern Siberian route to the Russian army
By crossing Bering Sea from Dutch
Harbor, thence through Kuril Straits
and across the sea of Okhotsk the
steamships could reach Nikolaivsk, at
the mouth of the Amur River, and sup
plies could thence be transported to
the Interior of Siberia and to Vladivo
stok. From Khaborovka, on the Amur,
a railroad runs direct to Vladivostok.

The authorities of New York, as did
those of San Francisco, gave the Rus
sians' a grand welcome. They showed
the Russian officers over the fortifica
tions of the port, and held a military
review in their honor, besides giving
them a reception. .
The significance of these acts was
the more marked in that an English
fleet, to whose officers only the usual
courtesies were extended, was at the
time lying In the harbor.
The fleet sent to Xew York was un
der command of Admiral Llssovsky,
and consisted of the flagship Alexandei
NevskI, the Oslabya, the Peresviet, the
Variag and the Vitiag.
The Variag â whose later namesake,
built at Cramps' yards in Philadelphia
in 1S00, went down in glorious defeat at
Chemulpo on February 10 last â came
first, in September, 1863, followed by the
admiral and the other vessels early In
October.
The reception' accorded to the visiting
guests was in every sense unequivocal
â a most cordial welcome and hospital
ity extended gratefully to openJy,

laterâNovember 17, 18C3âaccording to
the files of The Call of that date, the
civil and military authorities of San
Francisco and California gave Ad
miral Popoff and his officers a grand
ball, which was not a mere social
function, but a political demonstration,
which indicated a full understanding

their presence in the harbor.

RUSHING WORK ON FLEETS/
Although it is denied that the pres-,

the dispatch of either the Black Sea
or the Baltic fleet to the Far East,; It
Is beyond question that both are being

contents of the French note were
known in Europe, Russian fleets were
ordered to New York harbor and San

"I- wiil not- cooperate in such action

. OAKLAND, March 2.â An association
of the lumber dealers of Alameda Coun
ty has been formed within the last few
days. 'Most of the larger lumber firms
are members. The association has the
support of a number of the building
contractors of Alameda County, who
have agreed not to purchase from firms
not members of the Lumber Dealers'
Association, and there are indications
of a big building war in Alameda
County.
Representatives of the association
called upon Hugh Hogan, the president
of the Humboldt Lumber Company, to
day and requested him to become a
member of the combine, but he refused
to consider the proposition.

Joseph Kelly denied to-day that there
â¢would be any shortage, or at least not
entmgh of a one to speak of. All the

Austin was working amid the belts
and pullies when his blouse caught In
a cog-wheel and he was slowly, but
none the less surely, dragged into the
machinery. His left arm was caught
in the wheels and so crushed and torn
and that it was all but
pulled from the socket. The boy was
taken to the office of Dr. E. R. Sill,
where it was found necessary to com
plete the work of removing the arm.
The boy lives In San Francisco, at
the Presidio, but while working in the
East Oakland mill has been living
with A. J. Butler, at 1212 Twentieth
avenue.
While the shock has been very great,
it is believed that his youth will pull
him through. This Is the first accident
that has occurred in these new mills.
Ernest Austin, a lad employed in the
steel mill of the Pacific Steel and Wire
Works, in East Oakland; had his arm
torn out in the machinery this morn
ing, and the wheels were only stopped
in time to save his life.

More than two hundred representa
tive citizens of Oakland, interested in
the welfare of this city, have become
members of an organization known as
the "Oakland Boosters," the object of
which is, as its name suggestsrto ad
vance the interests of Oakland and to
use its influence for the accomplish
ment of much-needed public Improve
ments. The idea of forming a "boost
er?" club was first advanced by a num
ber of Board of Trade members, who,
on a recent excursion to Los Angeles,
saw how the inhabitants of the south
ern city always presented a bright
picture of their city to visitors. The
plan met the enthusiastic support of
many of the merchants and as a result
the "Oakland Boosters" has been
formed and Its members are pledged to
the extermination of the "knocker" and
the "chronic kicker."
The officers of the new club are:
President. A. D. Coplin; vice president.
Dr. H. B. Mehrmann; secretary. Wal
ter Fawcett. At the first meeting, held
layt night at the room of the Oakland
Board of Trade, the following commit
tees were appointed:

HIS Broadway, March 2.
The butchers employed in the mar
kets of Kohler Bros, and G. A.
Rothamel went on strike this morning.
The butchers' union has put the mar
kets on the unfair list and pickets have
been posted in front of them to enforce
the boycott. The cause of the trouble
is the refusal of the proprietors to
agree to the new schedule of wages
presented by the union, which calls for
a J2-a-week advance in wages. The
new schedule was presented to Kohler
Bros., who are the proprietors of the
Buffalo Market, at Twenty - second
street and San Pablo avenue*, and the
Excelsior Market, at Twenty - fourth
street and Telegraph avenue, and to
G. A. Rothamel, who runs the Pacific
Market, at Twentieth street and Tele
graph avenue, yesterday afternoon by-
Business Agent T. E. McGovern of the
butchers' union, and both firms re
fused to sign the agreement.
McGovern at once called a meeting
of the executive committee of the
union, and the men were ordered to
quit work this morning. Five men
were called out at Kohler Bros*, mar
ket and three at Rothamel's market.
The old schedule of wages for Jour
neymen butchers is $16 a week. It is
said that several other firms have re
fused to sign the agreement, and it is
feared that a general strike may be
ordered to enforce the demands of the
union.

With a pistol in his pnly hand, T. C.
Lane, a maimed brakeman of the
Southern Pacific Company, came out
of a lively melee in the office of Division
Superintendent Warren S. Palmer ot
the railroad at the Oakland mole'Mon
day afternoon and to-day he was ar
rested on a charge preferred againBt
him by A. W. Baker, an assistant su
perintendent under Palmer, who Lane
says attempted to throw him out of
the office. The accused man was ar
rested this afternoon, but was released
on bonds about 10 o'clock to-night.
There was a dispute over the amount
of wages he was to get and Lane went
to the mole to see Superintendent Pal
mer in regard to the matter. He did
not find Palmer, but found Baker. Lane
says that his complaint met with scant
courtesy from Baker and that he wa3
very shortly ordered out of the office.
He refused to go and says that he was
attacked by Baker and that when he
showed fight a second man came to
Baker's assistance. With but one arm
and attacked by two men he says that
he drew his pistol and made them stand
back while he made his retreat.
Lane says that he Is the victim of
duplicity and ingratitude. When he
met with the injury that cost him his
means of a livelihood he says that he
was promised a good job on the road
in another capacity if he would bring
no action for damages against the com
pany. He says that after he had re
covered he was sent down to Tracy,
where he has been doing work
that at the regular rate paid for such
work should have brought him 'about
$S0. Instead of this he was given $50.
Baker, when seen this evening, re
fused to talk.
Lane is well known in West Oakland
and has always been considered a man
of good character and habits. He lives
with his wife and family at 1032 Chester
street and those of his acquaintances
who know him well are surprised at
seeing him get into any such trouble.

Heretofore rummage Bales have
been held In this city without regula
tion or hindrance and several of the
churches were given to conducting
auctions monthly, finding them to be' a
source of considerable income. Inves
tigation on the part of the medical
members of the Board of Health had
convinced them that the dissemination
of infectious disease has in many in
stances been due directly to the pur
chase and wearing of clothing discard
ed by persons afflicted with contagious
ailments. This has been noticeable in
the prevalence of measles among the
local Japanese, who are liberal patrons
of rummage sales.
ALAMEDA. March 2. â All goods
hereafter offered at local rummage
sales will have to be thoroughly fumi
gated under the supervision of Sani
tary Inspector E. C. Maillott. This de
cision was reached after a general dis
cussion by the members of the Board
of Health last night of the danger of
spreading contagious diseases by the
distribution of cast-off clothing at sec
ond-hand auctions.

In obedience to the mandate of the
United States Supreme Court United
States Circuit Judge Morrow yesterday
dismissed without prejudice the bill
of complaint in the suit of the San
Joaquin and Kings River Canal and
Irrigation Company against the coun

Supreme Court was as follows:
That hereafter. In 3 caÂ»Â» the- counties i of

manner that, taken as a whole, the rates In
the three counties of Stanislans. Merced and

nished by Pattosien Co. read plainly
"$40.00 Fine Bedroom Suit for $26.00,"
and the error was made i by The Call
through the lise of a discarded copy.
This explanation is made by the paper

STOCKTON, March 2.â Albert J.
"Walters of Los . Angeles jumped from
the steamer Captain Weber this morn
ing on its -nay up from San Francisco
and was probably drowned. George
L.. Price of Alameda states that "Wal
ters said he had been on a spree for
five days and was so afraid that he
would harm himself that he offered
Price $100 to remain with him all night.
He seemed to have plenty of money.
He also asked Price to Inform his wife
in Los Angeles and a sister, Rebecca
Walters, in Randallstown, Md., if any
harm came to him. Early in the morn
ing, dressed only in his trousers and a
silk shirt, and apparently suffering
with delirium tremens, Walters, sud
denly jumped from the cabin window.
A search was made for him on the boat,
but without avail. One of the steamer
employes declares that he had seen
Walters take a life preserver.
According to Price, who left for Oak
dale to-day, Walters was well dressed
and seemed well-to-do. He gave his
age as 38, and said he was employed
with the Pacific Coast Borax Company.
Price, who is a member of the firm of
Price & Son, Alameda photographers,
says thaj Walters took his money with
him when he jumped from the window.
! Price declares that he gave the alarm

; and no attempt was made to rescue

F. S. Sutherland, known as the
"human fly" from his fearlessness In
climbing the dizzy heights of flagpoles
and steeples, is wanted by the police
on a felony charge of obtaining money
by false pretenses. The complaining
witness is J. L. Bronsted, a car
penter, living at 328 Eddy street.
Bronsted alleges that Sutherland
called upon him January 15 and
told him that he had entered into
a contract to tear down and rebuild 300
feet of the famous Eiffel tower in Paris.
He asked Bronsted if he would ac
company him, as he needed a good car
penter. Bronsted consented and the
following day he and Sutherland signed
a contract in which it was agreed that
Bronsted should be superintendent of
the Eiffel tower Job at a salary of $10
a day.
Bronsted and his wife left this city
for Paris accompanied by Sutherland,
who, it is alleged, on the strength of the
contract, borrowed at various times
sums aggregating $1000 from Bronsted.
After getting all the money Bronsted
possessed Sutherland disappeared and
Bronsted learned that the Eiffel tower
story was a myth.

"I didn't!" exclaimed Mrs. Gill, from

"You did," exclaimed Mr. Gill. .Then
When the wife of H. W. Gill, barber,
left his bed and board and returned to
the home of her father at 531 O'Farreli
street, the abandoned husband adopted
a peculiar means of occasionally re
minding her of his unaltered affection.
It has been his wont to station himself
in front of his father-in-law's dwelling
and voice his sense of deprivation in
coyote-like howls that make night hide
ous. While indulging In one of his
sleep-murdering serenades night before
last he was arrested and the charge
against him yesterday in Mogan's court
was disturbance of the peace.
"Why did you do it?" the Judge
asked.
"Do what?" was the defendant's
cross-query-
â¢ â¢ â¢
Mr. Gardner lost not a second in ac
cepting the invitation. A perfect cas
cade of autocratic sentiment was pour
ing from his lips when the court again
abruptly stemmed the torrent and pro
nounced him guilty. He will be sen
tenced to-day.
"Truly, that was going some," Mo
gan remarked in admiring tone when
John O'Donnell concluded his re
countal of how he had made Frank
Quesner, highwayman, look like the
proverbial 30 cents.
Mr. O'Donnell stated that at mid
night Tuesday he was seated In a Te
hama street saloon and "not paying no
attention to nobody," when Mr. Ques
ner entered and courteously solicited
information as to the exact time of
day. With equal courtesy Mr. O'Don
nell drew his gold watch from a vest
pocket and was about to supply the
asked-for information when Mr. Ques
ner wrested the timepiece from his
hand and hurried away with it. "When
he recovered from his astonishment
Mr. O'Donnell started In pursuit, and
after a sharp chase overtook the fleeing
thief, grabbed his coat collar with one
hand, "plugged" his eye with the other,
recovered the watch and handed his
prisoner over to the police.
"Mr. O'Donnell, you're a wonder,"
said the court, "and you will find your
gallant conduct rewarded by the pleas
ure of seeing Mr. Quesner deprived of
his freedom for as long a period as the
law permits. I will sentence him to
morrow."
"Let us remember that you are not
running this court," exclaimed the
power that was running it, "and we
may get along more amicably. Con
ceding that you are a pleader of more
than ordinary ability, this court can
not forget your position and give you
free rein to dispose of things as you
may desire. Now, go ahead."
"Xever mind the priors," said the
defendant, waving his hand as if he
desired to clear the atmosphere of his
past demeanors. "We'll let bygones be
bygones and confine our attention to
this unwarranted charge now before
you. Let the dead past bury Its dead.
Let us "
Nell Gardner wanted to do all the
talking when he was placed flbefore
Judge Mog?n to answer to a chajge of
petty larceny. He was specifically ac
cused of stealing two buggy robes
from vehicles standing on the street,
and, after glancing at him a moment,
the Judge recognized an old offender.
"You seem to be possessed of an un
controllable penchant for taking unto
yourself buggy robes without asking
permission of their owners," said his
Honor, "for here we find that on two
prior occasions you were arrested for
that offense."
"With this testimony stored away in
the judicial memory the case was con
tinued till to-morrow." :"'
Several witnesses testified that to
the best of their knowledge and belief
the horse had been shod when it really
needed shoes and had been as well
cared for as the average work horse
belonging to a ranchman of moderate
means.
Further questioning incidentally
elicited the information that Mr.
Young had labored in the spiritual
vineyard until he found the pecuniary
rewards therefor inadequate to sup
port his ever-increasing: progeny. His
children now number twelve and he
wrests a livelihood for them from the
stony and sandy soil at the southwest
corner of San Francisco County. In
his agricultural pursuits the equine ex
hibit in the case had been his faithful
and uncomplaining co-worker, and if
the quadruped were not in as fine fet
tle as Lou Dillon or some others of its
species the fault was owing to the im
pecuniosity instead of to the malice or
carelessness on the part of its owner.
I am a ranchman."
F. F. Young, a former expounder of
the gospel according to Presbyterian
tenets, was the stellar defendant of a
large and varied galaxy that passed in
irregular procession before the tribunal
of Mogan yesterday morning. The
charge against Mr. Young was cruelty
to animals and the prosecuting attor
ney depicted him driving a horse of
enfeebled physique and ramshackle
equipment. His defense was a com
plete denial of the accusation that his
treatment of the animal had been
wantonly inhumane.
Policeman Knight swore that the
horse appeared to be anaemic and un
kempt, that his rear feet were shoe
less, that his harness was a mass of
patches and knots, that a piece of
loose chain flogged his heels as he tot
tered along and that the vehicle to
which he was attached had a piece of
rough scantling serving for a whiffle
tree.
"Where do you dwell?" Inquired the
court, fixing a penetrative eye upon
the mild countenance of Mr. Young.
"My home Is at the southwest cor
ner of San Francisco County, two and
j a half miles south of the Southern
Life-saving Station, on the ocean
beach," was the deliberately delivered
reply.
"And your occupation?"
General Lew Wallace's penned nar
ration of the chariot race in "Ben Hur"
has just been pronounced a radiant
gem of literature, but there were folk
in Judge Mogan's courtroom yesterday
who opined that it was paled in thrill
ing effect by Patrolman Joy's recountal
of a sprint in which he participated
night before last on the Barbary Coast.
This verdict may have been Influenced
by the fact that the novelist's effort was
purely imaginary, while the policeman
told of an actual occurrence as he saw
it. Truth is always more Impressive, as
well as stranger, than fiction. Then,
too, the printed page lacks the direct
force of the recitation. Policeman Joy's
diction may have been less elegant than
General Wallace's, but any defect In
that line was more than compensated
for by his eloquent delivery.
The footrace had origin in a "scrap"
that disturbed the peace of Gomez's
saloon and dancehall on Pacific street.
The patrons of the establishment are
Afro-Americans and when L. R. Wal
lace, a piano mover, dropped in for a
drink and a pas deux there was nothing
distinctive about his color. Lottie
Smith and Ruby Galindo, belles of the
dusky district, divided the visitor's
terpsichorean indulgence while the
liquid refreshments were, set up c. o. d.
by Frank Silvey, the night bartender.
According to the story told in court
by Mr. Wallace, the first shadow of dis
cord was cast upon the gathering by
Miss Smith. Mr. Wallace could assign
no other reason for her '"obstrepelous"
conduct than her jealousy of the atten
tion paid by him to Miss Galindo.
Whatever the cause, Miss Smith sud
denly informed Mr. Wallace that he
couldn't dance enough to keep himself
warm â that he was awkward as a crab
âand she could not torture herself by
tripping another measure with him.
Mr. Wallace, who prides himself upon
his grace and agility as a cakewalker,
resented Miss Smith's criticism. "An*
den, yo honah," he concluded, "suthin*
wuz stahted an' we all mixed. When

Labrade Morales, a middle-aged Mex
ican woman, who resides in Hinckley
alley, will be compelled to explain to
Judge Mogan why she refuses to re
store to the custody of his mother a
17.-year-old boy, with whom she has
become infatuated. Mrs. Floss, the
mother, yesterday swore to the com
plaint, charging the other woman with
unlawfully detaining a minor, and
superfluously added that the moral
character of her son's abductor is not
above reproach.
â¢ â¢ â¢
After hearing: the testimony pro and
con Judge Mogan decided that Mr.
Sparrow had been sufficiently provoked
by the defendant to make the assault
justifiable and instead of obtaining re
venge Mr. Derocavich was made the re
cipient of a stern reminder that if he
did not keep his face in its natural
shape he would be temporarily de
prived of right of way to the Sparrow
restaurant.
George Derocavich resented his dis
missal by Restaurateur George Spar
row, whom he had been serving as
cook, by standing outside that gentle
man's rotisserie on Howard street, near
Ninth, and twisting his countenance
into flcnd-like expressions every time
his former employer looked at him
through the window. So distressing did
these facial distortions become to Mr.
Sparrow that on Tuesday last he sallied
forth and attempted to straighten out
Mr. Derocavich's features by vigorously
punching them, whereupon the assailed
one had him arrested for assault and
battery.
â¢ * â¢
Mrs. Gill repeated "I didn't," and Mr.
Gill retorted. "You did," until the
bailiff sternly silenced the lady and the
Judge shouted, "Stop it!" to the man.
"And you must stop your nocturnal
howling and . slaughtering slumber in
the 500 block of O'Farrell street," added
the court, shaking an admonitory finger
at the defendant. "If you ever come
back here on a similar charge I'll see
to it that you don't indulge in vocal
gymnastics tor a week or two, at any
rate."

Â¦ There are nja-ny good "people" who
â¢ Ere not good "parents." The qualities
' trhlch make a man a first-class gen
: -eral or banker or statesman or mer
chant do not necessarily make a first
"vlass father; nor do those which make
.'â¢a' woman a brilliant social leader or
;.rlub president or prize winner at whist
â¢ -parties, necessarily make a model
-jn other.
'.- In order to name all the qualities
"that go to make good parents one
â¢V-Culd have" to furnish a complete
jcatalogue of human virtues, but there
â¢are. a few that are essential.
.-. . â¢ â¢ â¢
"â¢ . And for -the first I select "a pro
â¢rcKind sense of personal responsibilr
lly." But some parents seem to re
gard themselves as merely links in the
â¢*Â«.:hain of life, to draw the next genera
tion after them with as much indif
/terence as iho links of a pump chain
; f'?el iti drawing one another over the
wheel! If the only influence in the
evolution of a child's life were
'^heredity, this might do. But environ
ment is, after ail, the main, shaping
""jjouer of character, and the true
parent feels that every day of a child's
life is a judgment day for him! He
"appreciates the perils of shipwreck.
â¢ He nieaf uros the tragedy of moral
-ruin. He holds himself accountable to
God for the character and destiny of
this b?ing he has summoned into life.
For the second 1 select "a 1 beautiful
Mending of sternness with gentleness."
I.t will not do for the father 10 be all j
.<>.ne and the mother all the other.
â¢JJa.cli must be both. But how difficult
;n is to keep the soul in this fine I
Â«-<!ui!ibriurr. â to be as hard as steel '
.and immovable as granite when a I
.cfeUd nef ds to be curbed or chastened i
:md . to be tis fluid as water and as I
caressing as air in all those moments '
.vvhen it needs sympathy and tender
.iksj! If you are not the first, the i
child will trample you under its feet, j
and if you are not the second it will |
.-consider you "an iceberg!
- ' In the third place (he prepared for a Â¦
furprife) I name "a keen sense of i
humor." So great is the importance of Â¦
thi5 pxacf in dealing with child life and j
.Â«o little recognition has it had that 1 1
may seem to exaggerate and throw it j
out of all proportion. But I had al- j
'â¢nost said: "PeoDle who cannot see a^
â¢jj">ke have no business being parents!";
Childhood is certain to be full of ab- '
Â¦ .-urditics. In adjusting themselves to !
the existing conventionalities of life Ceo j
many cf Which are irrational) the lit- â¢
tie i>eople will make ludicrous blunders '
by an unavoidable necessity. Nine- 1

as rational as the customs them- j

A Uttle girl was writing a composition '
en- "The Rabbit," and found herself in
the i>redirament of the port Schiller,'
Â¦who said of himself, "I have been for
â¢years trying to describe a hero without
-ever having seen one." This being the
case with the Ilftle girl, ehe asked the j
teacher "if the rabbit had a tail." "A |
Fmall oneâ none to ppeak of," ghe re-
T-lted. Whereupon the little girl af
firmed in writing: "The rabbit has a
rmall tail, but you must not speak of
it." ;
Â¦ Now, what is the parent to do who !
hasn't a keen sense of the humor ini
the thousand and one situations into!
which the ignorance of childhood i
crowds it, a-nd the quaint remarks in |
which it describes its impressions of
life? Â¦'Â¦?Â¦â¢ - ; :,L'

that was full of noisy boys. A half
dczÂ«n of- them were rolling and tum
bling en the dining-room floor, shout- j
ing ancJ pounding each other until the I
truest tiecanw- alarmed and asked the J
father why he did not interfere. The

tranquillity, "I>Â»t the lambs play!"
II i.Â« the ability to distinguish the

of th<"ir true relations. "Humor is
the invisible tear in the visible smile."
"Humor i* of a genial quality and
Â«-!ose!y allied to pity."
.Ah! There you come upon the deep
Virjd subtle beauty of a sense. of humor
in the parent! It is the feeling of pity
that lies bark of the emotion of fun.
All right minded parents realize the
;>ath?tic element in the ignorance and
Snexncrience of. the child. They laugh,
but 'hy also weep (secretly) at the
piteous situations in which the little
stranger flnds itself among all the ar
tificial conventions of our stiff and
formal social system. There is some
thing terrible about pouring the fluid
nnture of a little child into this rigid '
BECAUSE the usual spring floods, in the rivers of
California, are the only floods we have, the papers
make much of them for news purposes, but it is
well not to make too much, lest they be taken by East
ern readers as the Â£&.ual of the floods in the valleys of
the Ohio and the lower Mississippi country. . With
every acre counted, the tilled lands involved in our floods
seldom reach 50000 acres. While the flood is a very
serious matter to the owners of the inundated lands, it
makes comparatively little impression upon the general
production of the State.
Our rivers are land builders and these floods- transport
silt that raises the general level of the country. Man
cannot wait for nature to complete her slow construc
tion. He wants to use the land before its natural level
is completed, and does so by shutting out the water with
dykes and levees. When the rising waters make a
breach in these, the land is temporarily submerged, but
in the process it is raised a little and its fertility is in
creased, so that its future production compensates for
the loss of part of one season's crop and the cost of re
pairs. The water soon recedes and the same land is
planted later in the season, for the climate of California
permits the use of land for such a variety of crops that
only lack of water can keep land out of action for a
whole crop j-ear.
Putting floods among the accidents to which agricul
ture is liable in a very small part of California, an ex
amination of the effect and comparison with the accidents
that beset crops in the East leave such a balance in our
favor that it may be said that a wise farmer in the East
would gladly trade his chances for ours. There an in
exorable condition limits him to one crop a year. If we*t
weather destroy his small grain in the shock, or early
frost spoil his corn, he cannot plant a later crop of any
thing, and if the loss be so, large as to disorder his
finances, he burdens his land with a mortgage to tide him
over to the next seed time. Here he waits a brief space
and then crops his land to something else, for every day
in the year is seed time and harvest in California. Most
of the flood districts, in the sag of the great valley of Cal
ifornia where the. waters meet, in six weeks from now
will show no sign of the inundation, but every acre will
be growing some crop. The land owners whose fields
are involved naturally protest against 'such publications
as make possible an analogy between these floods and
the vast disasters of the same kind on Eastern rivers.
When the enormous drainage of the Mississippi and
Missouri rivers joins, and the snows of Nebraska, the
Dakotas and on the far watershed of the Yellowstone
melt and meet the rains on the drainage basin of the
Mississippi, an overflow is caused that overwhelms mil
lions of acres from Quincy to New Orleans. These
floods sweep away the crop possibilities of an entire year.
They cover a width of more than a hundred miles, and
their occurrence is a calamity that affects the revenues
of States, and the welfare of millions of people. In a
misfortune so vast the little and brief floods of the val
ley of California are lost sight of entirely.
Those Eastern floods frequently make necessary the
intervention of the Federal Government, and large ap
propriations are made from the Federal treasury, hi vain
effort to check them or to aid the people who are im
poverished by them. In this State the land subject to
occasional overflow is of great fertility, because it is
flood made land, the alluvium dissolved and divided fine
ly by the water, to make it the best medium for plant
food. This land is the equal of that built up by the an
nual floods of the Nile, on which were the world's an
cient granaries, and which to-day, under more skillful
cultivation, is regenerating Egypt, industrially and finan
cially, making it a greater country than the shepherd
kings dreamed of.
But California could spare all of these flood lands, and
by transferring the energies of their owners to other
fields suffer no loss in production. While this could be
done^t will not be, for the reason that there is no need
of it. These lands will continue to pour their product
into our horn of plenty, and their owners will prosper in
spite of storm and flood.
. mold and expecting it to take. the un
natural shapes without blunders and
protests.
Many tragic sights that I have seen
in homes where such formalism ex
ist and where childhood is judged
by parents who have no sense of hu
mor make me feel a profound relief
when I hear a hearty laugh from the
lips of a father or mother. For their
little new born souls need such laugh
ter as flowers need sunlight and rain.
* Let us laugh with them and laugh at
them! It has been sententiously said
"that Rome died laughing," for "the
j Romans were shouting and applaud
j ing in the theaters when* the vandals
were bursting open the gates." If
1 people had more children and a finer
I appreciation of the unconscious humor
in their thoughts and words they
would not need to go so often to cir
cuses and theaters for hollow and
empty laughter. The laughter pro
voked by childhood is as the music
I made by the rain upon the roof or the
I wind among the tree tops.
"Morally considered, laughter is
I next to the ten commandments."
i "Stupid people who do not know
I how to laugh are always pompous and
1 self-conceited."
"One pood, hearty laugh is a bomo
shell exploding in the right place,
while spleen and discontent are a gun
that kicks over the man who shoots
it off."
A home without laughter is a flower
without perfume, a bell without
sound, a lamp without light.
A keen sense of humor is as neces
sary in a parent as a keen sense of
justice is necessary In a Judge.

While facing the threat of a deficit in county funds the

has been demonstrated in young Hooper, the romancing

A few of his ilk would demoralize the best police force

on the Eastern shore.
Regarding this latter achievement,
the doughty Minnesota Senator spoke
playfully, but in considerable detail.
His account pleased the company
around the table immensely and, in
cidentally, it pleased the Senator that
he should be such an entertaining
post-prandial orator.
Now he is not without his regrets
for his playful speech, for yesterday
he received a letter from a resident on
the Eastern shore, demanding, in very
serious manner, full payment for that
horse. This Eastern shore man writes
that he was not present at the ban
quet tables, but stood in an adjoining
corridor and heard what the Senator
said. The letter gives additional infor
mation, so that Mr. Nelson has no
doubts of the claimant having been
the genuine owner of the captured
equine. â -Washington Post.

Solicitude.
Alice, the three-year-old daughter
of a local newspaper writer, is . the
happy possessor of a fine appetite,
which she uses to advantage at all
meals. One day at dinner Alice had
partaken freely of the dishes prepared
for her special delectation and then
expressed a desire for some cake.
"AliJe," said her mother, reprov
ingly, I do not think you should eat
any more. What an appetite you
have, to be sure! You certainly must
have a hungry-bug under your
apron."
Of course Alice had to know what
kind of an animal that was, and after
her mother had informed her to the
best of her ability she resumed ira
portunings for cake.
"Now, Alice," said her mother, "I'll
tell you what I will do. I will give
you two pieces of cake â one for you
and one for the bug 1 . But, remember,
you must not ask for any more."
Alice ate the two pieces of cake in
silence and then looked longingly at
the cake dish. Her mother's injunction
not to ask for any more had made a
d^eep impression, but finally the temp
tation was too great and the young
hopeful blurted out:
"Mamma, I think the hungry-bug
wants another piece of cake."
Fan History.
The name of the first fanmaker is
lost in obscurity, but Kan-Si. â¢ the
daughter of a Chinese mandarin, whp
flourished in an age that is long since
forgotten, was apparently the earliest
lady to use a fan.
So China â the cradle of the world'3
antique lore â was the birthplace of
the fan which is* in universal fashion
to-day. Chinese and Japanese " men
and women are rarely seen without
fans, and it is said that the very beg
gars in the Mikado's empire receive
the alms given them on the -tips of
their coarse fiber fans.
The ancient Greeks and Romans
used fans of enormous size. Some,
made of feathers, were so large that
they were 'borne by slaves over the
heads of their masters to protect them
from the sun's rays and to stir the
air.
The first folding fan seen in Europe
was a prized possession of the notori
ous Catherine de Medici and in the
reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI the
fan became a very gorgeous work of
art and was often jewel-studded and
exquisitely carved.
Catherine bf Arragon introduced
fans into England when she married
Henry VII's son, and Queen Elizabeth
owned some marvelous fans. one. rich
ly crusted *with brilliants, being a New
Year's gift from her favorite, the Earl
of Leicester.
Th~ Spanish conquerors of Mexico
and Peru brought Queen Isabel fans of
Inca feather work, which are to-day
in the museum of the Escurial and
are unique examples of the extraordi
nary skill of the vanished racr. '
Spain is, of course, the land of the
European fan, and few women can
equal th_? grace of the Spanish sendr;i
in the art of using the large black fan,
which she especially favors. â Weekly
Irish Times. ' t-Z " V
RUSSIA is wailing long and loud against. what it
terms the rank ingratitude on the part of Amer
ica in withholding from her the sympathy and
encouragement due a Christian nation and a friend who
is in combat with a pagan and an upstart people. To
this cry is now added that of sympathetic Germany,
whose press comes forward with invective and cartoon
against the pro-Japanese sentiment manifested by citi
zens of the United States. The most violent organs
even go so far as to state that when Japan is given a
trouncing by the sacred concert of the European powers,
it will be good employment for them to try a little sua
sion upon the most western of the_ white nations," "whose
growth during these hundred and fifty years has been like
that of some coarse turnip behind the barn."
Of course it profits not to take heed of the mouthings
of the jingo German press â its breed is even of a more
fearful and wonderful stripe than that on this side of the
Atlantic; but as the course of world diplamacy moves
along it behooves American statesmen to keep a close
eye upon the empire of William Hohenzollern. At first
glimpse it would seem that there is a very wide frontier
between the interests of the German state and those of
our own. We have no colonies along the Congo nor de
pendencies in China. There are no contending spheres
of influence in any barbaric state which harass the deli
cate diplomatic balance between nation and nation. The
strife of trade seems to be the only gage of battle which
has been taken up between us, but the force of circum
stances is bringing this country nearer every day to a
probable clash with Germany somewhere south of the
Isthmus of Panama.
Consular reports from our representatives in Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay are filled with the re
cords of German colonization, German trade develop
ment and German hands behind'Presidential chairs down
there. Only recently the Germans succeeded in obtain
ing from Paraguay a fat trade concession for one of their
lines of steamers and not many months ago an arrange
ment was made with the Government of Argentina by
which several thousand German agriculturists were es
tablished in a colony. on the Plata under practical self
government. So the tale runs continually.
It may be said that if the Germans are capturing
South America it is the fault of our American traders
themselves, and that the Monroe doctrine cannot be in
voked to keep out the merchant and the tiller of the soil
who choose to make their home in South America. But,
as this paper recently pointed out when the time comes
for a pan-American railroad to connect the United
States with the llanos of the Amazon and the Plata
there may be grave trouble.
At its present rate of growth German influence bids
fair to be the dominating factor in South American poli
tics within fifty years. When America wishes to build
its road down across the spine of the hemisphere it will
be, not with Brazil or Colombia that she must deal, but
with Germany, and it is that fact which renders the de
velopment of a sentiment hostile to us among the Ger
man people a matter of serious import to both countries.
GERMAN ATTITUDE TOWARD AMERICA.
No Cure, No Pay.
An elegantly dressed woman about 35
years of age called at the bond and
warrant clerk's office at the Hall of
Justice last Saturday afternoon and ap
plied to Assistant Louis Ward for a
warrant.
"What are the circumstances of the
case?" courteously inquired Ward.
"Well," she replied, "I was induced to
try a two days' cure for the liquor
habit at a place on Market street. I
paid the usual . fee, which was very
stiff, and after the two days expired on
Thursday I was discharged as cured.
Yesterday I was seized with an over
powering desire for strong drink, and I
am worse than ever. Now, I want you
to give me a warrant for the arrest of
the man for obtaining money by false
pretenses."
Ward"assured her that the law did
not cover such a case, but she protest
ed and insisted upon getting the war
rant. When Ward politely but firmly
refused her request she became very
indignant, and left threatening to take
the matter before the Grand Jury.

taking on passengers at stations. The '
new trains,. as planned, will cronsist; of
cars propelled by separate motors and
will work, says a waiter in Harpey's
Weekly, in the following manner:
"When a station Is approached the
passengers and baggage for that;st:*
tion are moved into the rear car,
which is cut off just before the point
is reached. The passengers desirous
of boarding the train take their places
in a car on a siding at the station;,
which proceeds to the main track a:
full speed and catches the- passing
train, to which it is coupled and the
passengers and baggage transferred.
Those for the next station are then
received, and in turn the car is duly
dropped. The scheme is most fan-'..
tastic, and at present impracticable, .
yet it must be admitted that many. of"
the elements necessary, such as se/p- "
arate motors which can be controlled
together or individually, are already
developed." .'

Love's Young Dream.
Her eyes were ' full of shy. sweet
confidence, if not assent, as they
looked up into his. What he was
saying to her was inaudible, but the
other people had no doubt it was
something exquisitely tender. They
were utterly unconscious of the other
passengers crowding about them as
they stood there on the upper deck of
the ferry-boat. It was evidently a
happy chapter in love's young dream.
A moment of silence between the
two. What need of words? They
watched the gulls sweeping and
curling hither and thither in swift
pursuit of the fragments of bread
tossed into the air by some children
on the boat. Then George bent low
and whispered softly to his inam

her countenance. All doubt and tim
idity disappeared. Slowly and delib
erately she spoke, as if to give fullness
to her expression. All the while her
eyes enveloped him with a look of
ravishing sweetness. He had touched
Angelina's heart, and her words told

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. MARCH 3. 1904.
THE Republicans of Ohio have acted most credi
tably in proceeding decently and in order, with
out wrangle or appearance of faction, to the elec
tion of Congressman Dick to succeed Senator Hanna.
Mr.dDick has represented the Akron district in the House
for four terms, including- the present Congress, and re
signs his seat as a Representative to take that of a Sena
tor. He is a young man, aged only 46, but has a long and
creditable experience in politics.
It was known that as Senator Hanna felt the uncer
tainty of life and the weight of age he indicated his wish
that Dick should succead him, and the party in Ohio has
not only respected that wish, but has affirmed its confi
dence in Senator Hanna's judgment of men. He rarely
failed in that faculty, which he had in a degree e,qual to
the late'Samuel J. THden's skill in seeing the capacity of
others and selecting them for a career. Iii.TUden's case
both Cleveland and William C. Whitney were brought
into public life by this faculty of foreseeing the results of
their individual quality. That Mr.Dick's career will in
like manner justify Senator Hanna's judgment there is
no doubt.
The Republican party is more concerned, however,, in
the selection of Senator Hanna's successor as chairman
of the National Committee. In the last two campaigns
the West was the Republican battle ground. The finan
cial issues promoted by Mr. Bryan had their origin and
stronghold in the Weft. Senator Hanna was peculiarly
fitted to fight that field and he did it, with tactical skill
that was the admiration of his party and theconfusion of
the. opposition. Now, however, the scene shifts and the
battle field moves with it eastward. Roosevelt's strength
in the West is inviolable. This is true not only of the
cis-Missouri country but of the trans-Missouri States of
the Middle West. The dalliance between Wall street and
the trusts and the Democracy makes the East the battle
ground, and acting upon the. good judgment that made
Hanna the general in two .Western campaigns it is pro
bable that an Eastern man will be chosen to head the
committee.
The party and the country will wait for that selection
HANNA'S SUCCESSOR.
Those qualified to speak of the affairs of Russia have
informed the world that the Czar is in no hurry to strike
a blow at the land forces of Japan, now intrenched in
Korea, but in good time and in the fullness of prepara
tion would drive the Japanese into the sea. It is per
haps timely to offer the uncomfortable suggestion that
Japan is aiso playing the game and will probably object
in her strenuous way.
Tzi'o Aspects of Panama.
Panama is not without development
in the present or promise for the future,
even away from the zone of great ex
pectations along the canal. Minerals
are in good evidence, gold, manganese,
copper and coal being found in prom
ising deposits. The central mountain
ranges aie but little occupied, and
amons them are . many beautiful and
healthy locations. There is a flourish
ins commerce, and some of the places
along the seacoast are of importance.
Bocas del Toro and the Chiriqui Lagoon
region enjoy an active fruit trade, and
lr.nd is still offered on favorable terms,
some of it Government land, to be had
for the taking. Probably the hill coun
try back of the Chiriqui Lagoon will
become one of the most favored agri
cultural regions in the tropics. From
Chiriqui Eouthward the coast is not
much occupied. Nearing Colon, cocoa
nut gloves become prominent and on
southward, among the islands of the
San Bias coast, such groves become
very abundant. In the interior of the
San Bias country are lofty, mysterious*
mountains, little known because the
San Bias Indians are hostile. It is
stated that among these mountains
gold is abundant; and from their po
sition in relation to other gold-bearing
regions of Panama and Colombia that
is not improbable. Farther south the
limits of the republic of Panama are
in the swamps of the Darien region.
Along the Pacific the land is not
greatly different from the Atlantic por
tions of the isthmus, excepting that in
the northern portions the hills come
more frequently close to the sea and
at some places gravel bluffs and coral
limestones are exposed to the action of
the surf. Well off the coast below Pan
ama City are the pearl fisheries, in the
waters surrounding groups of islands,
some of which are of considerable size,
and whose climate is said to be de
lightful. Near the Costa Rica bound
ary on the Pacific side is the David
region, a rich country, hospitable and
eager for development, where Amer
icans are sure of a hearty welcome.
On_ the swelling tides of the Pacific
one sees great steamers passing up and
dcwn.the coast to the city of Panama,
where commerce awaits, impatient at
the barrier of less than fifty miles
separating the mighty tides of the Pa
cific from the waters of the Caribbean,
where the tide scarcely rises at all.
The waters on either side of the isth
mus are as different as the waters of
one side of the earth can be from th^
waters of the other side. N6w the time
is at hand when they are to be united.
The great southern continent has
been for almost a century vitally in
terested in the various projects to con
nect by a canal the Atlantic and Pa
cific oceans.' But South Amerioa has
comparatively few voices of "public
opinion, and .it has been difficult to
ascertain just what the consensus of
opinion is among South Americans re
garding the independence of Panama
and the relations of the United States
to the entire canal project.
The general tone of the South Ameri
can press in its comments, so far as
can be ascertained, has been surpris
ingly mild and reasonable. Much bit
ter opposition to what has been termed
"the Yankee policy of aggrandizement"
might have been expected, especially
in view of what we have been hear
ing in the last few years about North
American* Insolence and the imperti
nence of the Monroe doctrine. The
present occasion might have been ex
pected to figure as a sort of climax to
Latln-Atnerican dislike for the United
States.
The animosity of Latin America for
TJnoIe Sam. however, has been a good
deal stronger in the newspapers than
In fact. The earliest comments on the
Independence of Panama and the canal
treaty were very mild, but later there
has appeared a spirit of animosity,
aroused no doubt by the reports of
opposition to the President in this
country and the utterances of Senators
and other public men on the "unjusti
fiable Interference" of the United
States. This later feeling has influ
enced most of the South American
countries to refuse recognition to the
new republic. Venezuela, Peru, Nica
ragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica and
Cuba are the only Latin-American
countries so far to extend such recog
nition. The. canal will so'- plainly "and
largely benefit the entire southern con
tinent .hat it is not surprising to find
bo few "expressions of rear or dislike
toward, our Government for the part
it has played in bringing about the
present situation âReview of Reviews.

LOS ANGELES, March 2.â Rendered
insane by a street railway accident for
which he was responsible and bellev-'

enforce payment by threatening to kill
H. E. Huntington and his son and to
blow up the power house and offices
of the Pacific Electric Railway Com
pany. After having been shadowed for
weeks by the detectives of the com
pany and after having once tried to
carry his threats into execution. Stark
was arrested to-night for insanity and
is confined in the County Hospital.
Stark was formerly an employe of the
Valencia-street line in San Francisco

SAN JOSE DE GUAYMAS, Mexico,
March 2. â Governor Rafael Ysabel of
the State of Sonora and General Lo
renzo Torres, in command of the Fed
eral forces, returned to this port to
day from an expedition into the Santa
Ursula Mountains against the Yaqui
rebels who -have been infesting that
country for months past, making life
unsafe on the surrounding ranches, pil
laging, killing and burning. A con
certed effort was made to dislodge the
Indians, and as a result they were sur
rounded, being defeated after a sharp
engagement. Fifteen Indians are now
known to have been killed and almost
a hundred braves taken prisoners. The
few who -"Â¦caped will hardly trouble
the ranchers longer.
General Torres and Governor Ysabel
personally ied the expeditions against
the Indians in response to many ap
peals which had been repeatedly sent
out from this district after each new
outrage committed by the savages.
The forces were brought as far as
Batamotal on the Sonora Railroad and
from there taken to San Jose de Guay
mas bv boat. In addition to the Fed
eral and State troops a volunteer force
was organized at San Jose de Guaymas
by the municipal presidente, Senor
Parodi, and Colonel Navarro recruited
a mounted force at the ranches in the
district.
Many prominent citizens took the
field with the force organized at San
Jose. The Indians felt safe In the re
treat as they had always been success

against them. The location of the
Yaqui's camp had previously been de

The country is rough and they, hav

tions. Robb said he believed such was
the case.
Senator Culberson then asked If
Perry S. Heath was not one of those
protected by the statute.
Robb answered in the affirmative,
adding that on account of the posi
tion which Heath occupied both offi
cially and politically he would have
been glad to have prosecuted him.
Senator Scott at this juncture de
clared that Robb was going outside of
his province in making such a state
ment. He moved that all reference to
the matter be stricken from the record.
This motion was carried by a strict
party vote.
Senators Culberson and Clay strongly
objected to the proposition to strike
the statement made by Robb from the
record.

BERIJN, March 2.â The rising of
native troops In the Cross and Nsasan
ang rivers region of German Kamerun,
West Africa, resulting in several fac
tories of the Northwest Kanierun be
ing burned and four Germans killed,
was caused by the eccentric conduct
of Count von Pueckler, and was direct
ly due to the theft of a lantern from
the Northwest Kamerun Company.
Von rueckler, who was the Govern
ment's District Commissioner, was re
puted to be a quiet and sensible ad
ministrator, having sound knowledge
of native ways and character. He for
merly was an employe of the North
west Kamerun Company, but recently
had . been employed by the Govern
ment. Ilerr Schoeller, president of the
company, received in December last a
.long letter from Count von Pueckler
regarding the stolen lantern, conclud
ing with the assertion that he intend
ed to make the property of^white men
respected by burning five villages.
Herr Schoeller inferred, ,from the vio
lence of the language, of Von Pueckler,
that .the latter was deranged, and
wrote both to the Count and to the
agents of the company commanding
that nothing be done over so trivial a
matter, saying that the company for
the first time was about to pay a divi
dend, and adding that the good will
of the natives must be cultivated. Herr
Schoeller's " letter arrived too late.
Count von Pueckler with twenty- five
men tried to arrest the head of one, of
the villages,, but the Count was killed
and his escort with difficulty escaped.
During the next few days the com
pany's factories en the Cross River
were : burned and four agents were
killed. A punitive expedition has now
arrived in the hostile district.
Count von Pueckler, as appears from
Information subsequently received by
Herr : Schoeller, had recently' given
away to fits of fury against the negroes,
attributable to the state of his health
as a result of his long residence in
the hot climate of Equatorial Africa.

CARDINAL BASEBALL) MEN
SHOW OIPROYTSD FORM
Defeat the Alumni Team by a Score
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
2. â The varsity baseball team braced
up in to-day's game with the alumni
and played in a way that made yester
day's showing appear like a night
mare. The alumni went to defeat,- the
score being 4 to 2. The ragged play
ing so evident in yesterday's contest
was noticeably absent to-day. But
three errors were made, two of them
being muffs of fly balls by Chalmers in
right field, and the other by Tritch in
an overthrow to first' base.
Shortstop Trowbridge and Second
Baseman Williams of the varsity
team played in particularly good
form, the former taking seven chances
and the latter six without an error.
Tritch pitched a steady game, striking
out two men, giving one his base on
balls and allowing but six hits. Sales,
Wirt. Ball and Trowbridge secured
the four hits with which the varsity
was credited.
For the alumni Elston. the second
baseman, put up the best game of
fielding, while "Brick" Morse, the cap
tain, proved best at the ball, getting
three hits out of four times up.
Parker and McKay pitched a fine ar
ticle of ball for the visiting team. The
teams were made up as follows:
Stanford â Williams, Sales, Chalm
ers. Wirt, Ball, Stott, Swain, Trow
bridge and Tritch.
Alumni â -Spencer, Morse, Elston,
Cowder, Hamlin, Waters," McKay,
Hatch and Parker'.
The big horse Proper, from the Jen
nings stable, cut in well when he en
deavored to concede sixteen pounds
and administer a beating to Mike
Daly's black colt Judge yeBterday ' in
the mile and 100-yard handicap at Oak
land. He came about as close to doing
it as Young Corbett will of stowing
away Jimmy Britt in a dozen rounds.
Proper was assigned 123 pounds, but
for all that the heavy track was fig
ured to be In his favor, and from 2\i
his price was played down to- 8 to 5.
The comedy was furnished in the
quotations about Judge and Celebrant,
each carrying 93 pounds. Of course,
last Saturday Celebrant defeated
Judge, but Johnny Daly, who rode the
latter, went all to pieces the last eighth
of a miie in that race. Yesterday
Judge opened at 10 and receded to 13.
Four was the opening price against
Celebrant.
Travers, on Celebrant, had orders .to
kick mud on Judge for some part of
it at least. Travers carried out in
structions, leading the Daly colt al
most to the stretch. Then "Willie Daly,
on Judge, picked up the running and
at the finish won about as he pleased
from Proper. Gorgalette ran third.
Much money was lost on the favorite,
and the pedigree experts are endeavor
ing to figure out how many double
crosses there are In Judge.
THREE FAVORITES SCORE.
There was a good crowd present, but
the betting for some reason was a trifle
lighter than usual. Favorites finished
in 1 front on three occasions. -
"Walter Jennings introduced a smart
filly to the public in Amy J, which ran
circles around the other starters in
the two-year-old dash. For some rea
son the books took no stock in the tip
that the daughter of Bendoran could
go some and the early risers obtained
a little 12 to 1. There was 7 and 8 to
1 for everybody. Eduardo ruled fa
vorite and Bell met with his usual ill
luck, poor old chap, finishing in the
ruck. Jack Martin piloted Amy J
and, shaking off his field at the start,
simply cantered in first by five
lengths, the filly covering the half
mile in 50 seconds. Salable ran his
race, downing My Order a head for
place honors.
With Geheimness, Ocyrohe and a
couple of others scratched from the
first event, James Neil's three-year
old, Distributor, was installed favorite.
The gelding was almost M.eft at the
post and finished third. , The; Hawaii
an played down ffom 3, and which re
placed Distributor for the honors of
favoritism at post time, collared Royal
White in the stretch, .winning handily.
Harka, backed from 10 and 12 down
to 4 and heralded as one of the best
things that ever came down the pike,
showed some early speed, but not
enough to Justify the plunge made on
her.
HULFORD WINS HAXDILV.
Harry Stover's Hulford completely
outclassed the starters in the five and
a half furlong sprint- following, and
from 7 to 5 the odds dropped to 9 to 10.
See got the gelding away first and won
all the way. Hoceo outstayed Box
Elder, \taking the place.
Both Elliott and Velma .Clark* wers
absentees from the fifth number, a" six
furlong selling run, which left MImo
a 6 to 5 chance. Travers rode a weak
race on El Piloto and the; favorite,
after leading from the Jump, beat
"Frisco" Hoag's sprinter a length.' St.
Winnifride was heavily backed, but
never evinced any particular liking for
a slow track and ran third. Mocorito
never cut any figure in the race.
Three pounds less weight worked
wonders in the form of G. W. Trahern.
On February 22 Joe Quinlan's gelding
started favorite in Â«. rape and ran un
placed. In the last race yesterday "the
ring laid 8 to 1 about Trahern and he
spreadeagled his company. Axminster
took the place, three lengths before
Oro Viva. Jimmy Coffey's mare Evea
G, the post favorite, showed a speck, of
speed early in the game, but soon grew
weary, falling back to the rear rank:'

Harka was reported to have worked

Hulford was bid up from $400 to $700

Achille Roos offered a valuable
trophy for competition at Stow Lake
among the club members In delicacy
and accuracy. It is to be won twice
before becoming the property of any
competitor. Those present last night
were:
Judge J. M. Seawell spoke, M. J.
Hyjies sang and F. H. Reed, Colonel
G. C. Edwards, Alex. T. Vogelsang
and James Watt all contributed to the
entertainment of those present.
A committee consisting of Judge
Hunt, Alex. T. Vogelsang and Achllle
Roos was appointed by President
Young to select a suitable testimonial
for Mr. Mansfield as a token of appre
ciation of the services he performed for
the club.
Judge John Hunt presided In his In
imitable style. As usual, Charles S.
Wheeler, who represents the highest
type of the angler, made the hit of the
evening. He pictured the delights of
the pastime so vividly as to make his
hearers long for the day when, with
creel and rod and flybook, they will
again seek their favorite streams.
George Lane paid a heartfelt tribute
to Walter D. Mansfield, who was
president of the club for seven years,
retiring at the recent election.
Those brothers of the angle, the
members of the San Francisco Fly
casting Club, met at a smoker last
night and exchanged reminiscences
of past seasons on the famous trout
streams of the high Sierras and talked
of the season soon to open.
Young Corbett intends taking; a boll
day afield before he settles down to
the routine of training for his fight with
Brltt. 'With Harry Corbett and Colonel
Martin Brady as guests he will tour, to
Del Monte In his automobile. He ex
pects to devote two days to the trip
down and back and will possibly spend
two days sightseeing on tha Seventeen
mile drive and elsewhere.
Corbett's trainers think this let up
will do him rood, sub he easily tires of
gymnasium work. Ho Is hardly lazy,
but the routine wearies him. When he
puts on the gloves It Is different and
he enters Into the boxing with great
spirit. He never became seriously In
terested in training: for Dave Sullivan
and It was difficult for his handlers to
get him to do the amount of work re
quired to put him In condition.
As he does not drink and smokes but
one cigar a day It will not take long
to get him Into condition, especially as
he knows the bruising battle he is en
tering upon.
Jimmy Britt began his training yes
terday for the contest. He Installed
himself comfortably at Croll's gardens,
where he will fit himself for the fight,
which it Is thought will be the hardest
In his ring experience.
He feels perfectly at homÂ« at Croll'a
and has the run of the place. He flnd3
congenial surroundings one of the es
sentials for the proper conditioning of
himself and Is careless and free as a
schoolboy while going through the daily
routine he has to undergo. He went
around yesterday and renewed his ac
quaintance with every one connected
with the establishment. There was lit
tle real work done, but the parapher
nalia In the gymnasium was tested and
a little light exercise was Indulged In.
In a day or two the regular daily grind
will be taken up and continued without
letup to the allotted date.
Brltt was accompanied by Fred
Landers, but the camp will be aug
mented In a day or two by the arrival
of "Spider" Kelly and Frank Rafael,
who are expected to Join the staff and
aid in putting Britt through his paces.
He and Landers went out for a stroll
last evening and talked over the pros
pective battle, which will be the one
topic of conversation until Brltt and
Corbett meet.

The factory of the Baden Company
is on the third floor of the building:
and is reached by a narrow winding
stairs. At the top of the stairs on
the third floor is the door to the ele

forced open. The elevator was found
at the top floor, but blood stains on
the floor of the elevator and on the
floor by the entrance at the thirQ

Baden has for some time occupied
an office at 112 First street and re
sided with his family at 10US Steiner
street. While his death was without
doubt the result of an accident, it was
at first thought by the police that mur
der had been committed. The body
was found lying in a mangled heap at
the bottom of the shaft with arms and
legs broken and the skull fractured.
Samuel Baden, a manufacturer of
ladies' skirts and shirt waists,
brother-in-iaw to Attorney Henry
Ach, met death in a horrible manner
yesterday morning. His dead body
was found by Gus A. Ston?, an er
rand boy, lying at the bottom of an
elevator shaft.
Baden leaves a widow, daughter
and two eons. The body was taken
in charge by Attorney Henry Ach.
Police Officer Chupelle stated yes
terday afternoon that he had often
warned Baden about beingr careless
with tmÂ» elevator. He" further says
that Baden was in the habit of arriv
ing 1 at the building before daylight,
and was invariably careless in the
manner he operated the cage.
The- theory of robbery and murder
was .quickly discounted when, upon
seaithing the-^oody, it was found that
the dead man was armed with a 38
caliber revolver and had about twenty
dollars on his person.
there that Baden met his death.
It is the belief that Baden, on
reaching the third floor, forced open
the door lending out of the elevator,
at the stame time starting the elevator
upward. In this way the body must
have been crushed between the ele
vator and the floor above.
Employes of the' Baden Manufac
turing Company say that Baden was
in the habit of getting down to his
office! very early in the mornings,
sometimes arriving: before 4 o'clock.

ceed with the incorporation under, the

chanpe Company. Nearly all the dele-
gale, present subscribed for stock. .'â¢ Provieior* were subjected to heavy > liquida
tion at the outset. Much of the selling press
ure-was due to the weakness, in coarse grains
and to decline In hog prices at the yards.
Packers aud foreigners became active' buyers
Oats were extremely weak early in the day
on heavy profit-taking credited to the principal
holder. May closed iÂ£Â®%c higher, at 42'/4<g>

at 3O9ic.
CHICAGO, March 2. â Perhaps the feature
that attracted meet attention from wheat
traders was the Gcvernment crop report, which
In its general summing up of the appearance
of winter wheat stated that the condition of
the olant was unpromising over much-- tho
greater part of the wheat belt, because of se
vere weather without snow covering. The Â«ie
rlouimeM of the Argentine railroad otrlke was
emphasized ajiew in a cable dispatch from
Liverpool stating that a fear of a curtailment
of wheat shipments from Argentina on ac
count of the ctrlke caused relative strength in
English markets In the facn of the sharp d<>
rllno here yesterday. Under thes*Â« . influences
the market ' onened strong, with May up
KiflVic, at J)894(g:Â«Â»c. and July %Â«S>Y*c higher^
at 02VtÂ©02>4c The May option soon lost all
Its initial gain, developing decided weakm>sR
on fffneral liquidation. Before any Â»Â«upport
came Into olay prices had dropped to Â»?Vic, a
loss of l*ic from the opening high price. With
the timid longs quite thoroughly aolrt out, of
fering* becarac scarce, and tho price gradu
ally worked its way toward a higher level. The
more distant deliveries held firm In rjiite of
the early decline In May, commission houses
being active buyers of both July and Septem
ber. The market later became strong. One of
the features in the late strength was a marked
improvement in the export demand. Prospects
of o cold wave in the Southwest gave added
zest to the buying, the volume of business
reaching a large total. Th* close was almost
at tho ton. After selling to 904c, final fig
ures on May were itOVic July closed at the
high point, at 05Wc Weakness prevailed in
corn diirlnr the opening hour, due to heavy
liquidation.- The strength 'In wheat, however,
caused an lmoroved demand. The close was
at the ton price of the day. May closing at
554Â©fÂ»5Wc. July closed at 54c, after gelling
between 52 He and 54c.

BARLEYâ Futures were slightly higher
agHln. The cosh market fxhlbited several note
worthy features. One was the statement that
ICOO. tons hud just been sold for shipment to
Australia and another was a demand for bright
Fe<>d for Honolulu, mentioned several dHys ago.
It appears that Honolulu has for some months
beÂ»n getting its Barley up in Â«ho two northern
State*, but has left there and come Into this
market, where It can do better. Barley Is
woitH $1 12'/i@l ir> up there, and the freight
to Honolulu is higher, than from San Fran
cloco, so this market Is now grttlngr the busi
ness. /

CASH WHEAT.
, WHEAT â The foreign markets, continued
quiet and featureless. { A cable from the Ar
gentine said that there was no prospect of a
settlement of the railroad strike, which has
assumed very serious proportions,- traffic being
paralyzed.
Chicago was 24c higher on the day, with no
news worthy of note. - j . ,
In this market futures were higher, but the
demand for cash Wheat was light, as next
Jlondny is tax assessment day and nobody
wants to own any more Wheat than he can
avoid on that day. '

The situation In Cheese Is like that In Kcga.
the market being glutted and 'leniorallzvil,
with buyers scarce and holding off. The low
prices do net f*>em to tempt them.
Â¦ Butter has turned weak a^nln, and some
dealers are shading the quotations to sell. It
was reported yesterday that strictly choice
creamery had been offered down to 21c. The
demand is slow and stocks are large.

. The depression In Eggs continues. Receipts
continue very heavy and the accumulation of
stock here i;, formidable. Great piles arc to be
sefcn 111 all the large commission houses, and
as Is always the case when the market is going
down everybody Is afraid to buy. Storing
would relieve the market, but most dealers
are afraid to store now. as Eggs that are stored
thus early In the season are not likely to keep.
This glut of Krss hnppf>ns tvery. yoar about
fhis time, but it seems to.be rather more pro
nounced this >THr than usual.

Harrison's circular says: "Since the last
mail per steamer Ventura there has been but
one arrival of coal from Australia, vli. : The
Drumcraig from Sydney, with 547 tons of coal
and 22S2 tons of coke. Within the past two
months we have had but two arrivals of Co
lonial coal, amounting to 3747 tons, hence the
stock of Australian on hand has materially
diminished. In fact there Is absolutely no
Australian steam grades whatever in first
hands. If It were not for the liberal arrivals
of Coast coal there would have been a marked
advance In valuen, but with fuel oil as a
competitor there is no noticeable change In
price. There are at present reperted on the
chartered list to load coal fropi Newcastle six
teen vessels, with a carrying capacity of
about ItO.CCO tons, and some of these will not
arrive hore before the latter part of this year,
hr.nce Colonial coal Is only a small factor
In establishing local values. Almost all the
transportation from our northern collieries is
being done by steam, at low rates of freight,
so that the future grades of foreign coal will
be best adapted fcr domestic uses only,* and
British Columbia and Washington will pro
vide about all that Is utilised for steam. We
have had a succession of rain storms locally
for the past several weeks, which has called
Into requisition an increased consumption of
fuel for house purposes."

will be vsry alow, as growers will have to ac
cept lower urices than they expect because
scourers here are restricted by the low quota

Is expected to come forward looking much poor

SUMMARY. OF THE MARKETS.
The only chantre is an advance in Cocoanut
Cake. Bran, and Middlings continue steady
and. the Hay market is again reported in gtiod
condition for sellers.
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"Receipts of Hay have been averaging about
450 tons per day for the past ten days, the
total for the week Just ended amounting to
2700 tons, about the same as that reported a
week ago. The situation remains unchanged
In every way. with two elements at work
which seem to about counteract each other.
Since the ralvs both consumers and retail deal
ers have felt, that prices should be 'lower and
have been withholding their purchases accord
ingly. On the oth? r hand, receivers of Hay,
knowing that stocks are very light throughout
the State, have felt that the situation does not
warrant a decline, and without any particular
effort in this direction have maintained last
month's conditions, without* material change.- It
was expected that shortly after our good rains
set in quite a number of -outside lots of Hay
would seek this market. It Is true that we
have heard from a few such lots, but nothing
of any great consequence, and as the Interior
demand from some Â¦ localities continues the
situation still holds quite firmly and will doubt
less continue so until the new crop begins to
be marketed In large quantities. It must be
remembered that we are liable to â¢ be called
upon at nny time for a large amount of Hay
for the Orient, which we are in no position
to nil to very good advantage. A call for
5000 tens might necessitate the shipment to
this market of quite a bit of Hay from Kansas
an-I Nebraska to tide us over until our new
crop Is ready. The lowest freight rate obtain
able on such shipments is $10 per ton. so it
can be readily seen that none of that Hay can
be sent here at present prices, especially as It
Is considered greatly Inferior to the California
product. ' : - â¢ - Â¦ Â¦ -
"On the whole our market shows no change
â¢from the report given last week, with quota
tions unchanged also."

*Y Sergeant Blank testified to making
the arrest and subsequent? events and
Assistant | Bond Clerk Bernard Flood
told about' taking the dying statement.
An adjournment was then taken until
to-day at. 10 a. m.
Ernest Fournier, a 14-year-old mes
senger boy, . residing at 683 San Jose
avenue, was placed on' the stand. : He
said he was going home, on the night
of November S and heard loud talking
coming from the Dirking residence.
He placed his bicycle against the fence
and listened. Feld wasoutside of the
partly -opened door, trying to force
his way into the house, and was strik
ing some-one. Dirking then came out
and said, "You , had ' better get away
from here." Feld- then stepped back
and fired' a shot at Dirking. Dirking
followed Feld up the hill toward Cali
fornia avenue. Cross r examihation
failed to shake the boy's testimony, al
though the defense adopted the same
tactics in regard to testimony, given
at: the preliminary hearing. â¢ * -
Mrs. Clementina Dirking.the widow,
was next called upon to relate her
story. Her testimony was practically
the same i as given j by, Fritz Dirking,
with the additional , Information that
Feld had struck her with the bar
while â¢ she was endeavoring to keep
him put. â¢ District Attorney. Byington
attempted to show by this witness that
from bruises on Mrs. Feld's body after
the tragedy her husband had. also
struck her, but the court sustained an
objection. During the recital of her
testimony Mrs. Dirking's eyes filled
.with tears on more than one occasion.
Cross-examination of the same char
acter to .which the preceding witness
had been subjected failed to shake her
testimony. ' .
WIDOW GIVES TESTIMONY.
the knife had never been found and
that when his wife accused him of do
ing the shooting Feld made a threaten
ing movement toward hen {
Dr. William P. Chilson of St. Luke's
Hospital was next placed upon the
stand and described the location of the
bullet wound -and the. extent of the
scalp injuries. He gave it as his opin
ion that the wound on the head could
have been made by a bar similar to
the one in evidence.
Dirking senior then pushed his wife
aside ; and Feld struck him with .an
Iron bar. The boy says he then
heard Feld use several vile names/saw
him draw a revolver and fire a shot.
Feld, followed by' Dirking, went - up
the street, and after going a- short
distance turned and said, "I 'have got
something quicker than a knifel"
Young Dirking then; ran* to . Mission
street for an officer and returned . to
the house. , He heard scuffling in \ r his
sister'p room and-thereupon went" into
an â¢. adjoining room *and secured, .his
father's revolver.' " At this . juncture,
Feld came' out into the hallway with
his wife holding him by the hands.
The boy stated: that he pointed' .; the
revolver at Feld's'head and tried ..to
pull .the hammer down, but without
avail. Some one.was'heard approach
ing from the' outside and Feld ' "said,
"Here, take this^gun; M the, police; are
coming," at the same time . handing
the. weapon to his. , wife. Two -men
came in and held Feld until \ the- ar
rival of Sergeant Blank. .. To , the.-of
ficer Feld accused the boy of." having
fired the shot, but Mrs. Feld said 'her
husband was the guilty person. â¢ '
- At this juncture the prosecution sub
mitted for, Dirking's inspection the;re- ;
volvers,' and, upon his identification,
they were admitted in evidence. ; An
iron bar, in reality a. "jimmy." Â¦ pur
porting to be the one carried by Feld,
was offered as an exhibit for the peo
ple, to which the defense. objected on
the ground that it had not been proven
that it was. the bar in question. 'After
some argument Judge Â¦ Dunne "over
ruled the objection, made. , The, dead
man's coat and .vest "were next v intro
duced by the prosecution. .
â¢Upon cross-examination the- defense
endeavored to impeach the witness by.
reading from -the record, particularly
relative to" the iron, bar. and what" Feld'
said f upon --the ; arrival of -Sergeant
Blank. From questions 'about the'size
of. the knife a foundation was ;laid for
Bell-defense. It was brought out that
KNIFE WAS NEVER FOUND.
The lad told a graphic story of the
tragedy, and, although somewhat
nervous upon cross-examination, all
attempts of the defense to impeach
his testimony on material points by
reading from the transcript; of v his
testimony taken in the police court
failed. . . .; ?
He said that on the night^of No
vember 2, 1903. he was in the kitchen
of the house at 11 Fair avenue, read
ing, and that his father, mother and
sister' were in the same room. Their
attention was first attracted by -the
barking of a dog, and then they,
heard the footsteps of a person com
ing toward the back door. Mrs. Feld
wife of the defendant, exclaimed,
"He's coming," and bolted the "door.
His father then told the women to
get out of the room and the. boy.
armed himself with a bread knife.
Feld started kicking on the door' and
Mrs. Dirking ran through the > hall
crying "Murder!" She went to the
front door and Feld ) came ud the
alley- way alongside of the house. The
boy's father then ~ went through' the
hallway, and as he did so the lad
gave him the knife and told him' "to
protect himself." ;- When he reached
the front door Feld was trying to
force an entrance and his mother was
endeavoring to.keei* him out.

Golden Gate Hall was very hand
somely decorated last evening for the
annual banquet of the association.
Festoons of flags and bunting hid the
ceiling and a flower screen stretched
across the stage concealed the or
chestra, which furnished music that
could not, however, drown the merry
din of hundreds of voices. About a
third of the diners were ladies. C. H.
Philpott was the toastmaster and kept
the company in a happy mdod as he
inntroduced the following speakers: J.
C. White, "General Topics" ;J.W. Hell
man, "Why the Retail Hardware Mer
chants Should Work in Harmony With
the Wholesalers"; Roy Hall, retiring
president Â¦ of the association, "Love
One Another"; G. A. Gutman, "Mr.
Dinkelspiel"; J. C. Nailor, "Standing
Together"; A. Carrigan, "Pleasures of
Business Life"; E. Janssen, "Once War
Was Business, Now Business Is War";
Mr. Harris, "Retail Merchants From
a Traveling Man's Standpoint." Other
addresses were delivered by L. Walsh,
A. A. Watkins, A. C. Rulofson and W.
R. Wheeler. The speeches were all
brief and pointed arid they were re
ceived with much applause.

Police Officer } George W. .Russell,
who made the diagram of the-prem
ises at 11 Fair avenue, was the first
witness called. He explained the dia
gram to the jury. Fritz Dirking, the
16-year-old son of the man who was
killed, was next placed on the stand.
District Attorney Byington then
made an opening statement of the facts
In the case and of what the prosecu
tion Intended to prove. He told of the
events of the night of the shooting and
said the prosecution would prove that
the crime 'was ' premeditated from
threats made by the defendant on three
occasions. . ..* â¢
Feld was one of the most interested
persons In the courtroom and at no
time did he evince any particular nerv
ousness. He held a handkerchief in
his right hand and the other clasped
the hand of his mother, who sat by his
side. He was to prompt his at
tcrneys on material points and during
the entire proceedings failed to show
by any outward sign that he appre
ciated the seriousness of his position.
During the testimony given by Mrs.
Dirking, the widow of the man he
slew, Feld eyed her steadily and even
the tears shed by the 'somber ..little
woman in black during the recital' of
the events of that fateful -night' failed
to move him.
BOV TELLS OF TRAGEDY.
In the cross-examination of witnesses
counsel for the defendant showed that
it will endeavor to combat the testi
mony of the prosecution's witnesses by
showing that Feld acted In self-de
fense and that a conspiracy exists in
the family of the deceased to manu
facture damaging testimony. This lat
ter feature was borne out by the ex
haustive cross-examination by Attor
ney W. IL Alford on contradictory tes
timony given by the witnesses at the
preliminary examination and the ad
mission by Attorney J. A. Spinetti in
an interview that it was the intention
of the defense to establish that fact by
pointing out to the jury the discrep
ancies in testimony given at the pre
vious hearing of the case.
Contrary to expectations the opening
day of the trial in Judge Dunne's couri
of Joseph Feld, the ex-policeman,
charged with the murder of Fritz Dirk
ing, his father-in-law, on the night of
November 2, 1903, was devoid of any
thing that savored of the sensational.
Rapid progress was made by the pros
ecution and by adjournment time this
afternoon it is thought the defense will
have presented all of its testimony.

LOS AGN'ELES. March 2. â Harry Fernald.
an employe of the Los Angeles Brick Com
pany, was caught by a heavy belt whlla oil
ing the machinery of the plant to-day, drawn
around a pulley and killed. Fernald leaves a
wife, who is seriously 111.
A charge of being found in posses
sion of tools for counterfeiting coin will
bÂ« made against tho prisoners.
Whether the woman informed him
as to the whereabouts of the die is
unknown, but Varni, suspecting that
it was in possession of Carossi, caused
his arrest on a charge of carrying con
cealed weapons. While Carossi was in
custody Varni searched his room, but
was unable to find the die. Then to
Fhow that he bore no enmity toward
his friend he engaged a lawyer to de
ffettd Carossi from the charge which
he himself had made.-
It w?s while these persons were in
the City Prison about a month ago
that Detective Sergeant McManus
Jearned that they were suspected of
being engaged in counterfeiting and
he communicated with United States
Secret Service Agent George W. Hazen,
â¢who at once detailed shadowers to fol
low the suspects wherever they went,
day and night.
At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon Vis
ciglio and Carossi were seen to enter
Varnl's shep with something heavy
wrapped in a newspaper. When the
men came out they were arrested by
Foster and McManus, while Hazen and
Cronin searched the locksmith. In his
pockets they found the steel die. to
gether with the collar and the chuck.*
Varni denied all former knowledge
of the die, but the secret service men
f'&y that they have a good case against
him. They have learned that his wife
used to buy the Mexican dollars which
Varr.i is said to have restamped into
American standard dollars.
Â¦ The exposure of the gang came about
indirectly through a woman who be
fore her marriage with Varni consorted
Â¦with him and was known as Julia Ca
riglia. The woman and Varni had a
quarrel, and in order to revenge her
pelf or to hold it over his head as a
threat she stole the steel die from
Varni. He was very much put out
about its loss and consulted a lawyer
concerning the matter. He was ad
vised to marry the woman, for as His
wife ehe would not be allowed to tes
tify against him in court. Varni ac
cepted the advice and nfarried the wo
man in the latter part of January of
this year.
For several months past the secret
service men have been trying to lo
cate the plant from which counterfeit
silver dollars have been issued. These
are the most dangerous of all counter
feits, for they are made of pure coin
eilver and would be received at par
anywhere. A close inspection of some
of .the pieces found recently shows that
they had been stamped out of Mexican
silver dollars.
United States , Secret" Service Agents
Hazen, Foster, McManus and Cronin
made important arrests yesterday aft
ernoon and seized a steel die that had
been used in the manufacture of. coun
terfeit dollar pieces. The prisoners are
Marsigrlio Yarni. a locksmith and gun
smith diring business at S10 Sansome'
street, and two of his companions
named Giuseppi Carossi and Francisco

lined the work before the; convention
at some length, and then the nominat

its recommendation the following offi
