Special Dispatch to The Call,
On the nights of July 2, 3 and 4 the
Japanese fleet bombarded the forts
from the south of the town. The forts
were not damaged. No further night at
tacks have been made since July i.
A Chinese mechanic from the Port
Arthur drydocks says that two largo
three- funnel ships have been missing
from the Russian fleet since the tight
off Port Arthur on June 23. The bat
tleship Sevastopol Is still undergoing
repairs and four torpedo-boat destroy
ers are in the drydock.
The Russians, on the other hand, say
that their fleet is intact and as a mat
ter of fact the Japanese, have been the
heavier losers In the recent- engage
ments off Port Arthur. The 'Russians
assert that the Japanese have lost no
less than ten torpedo-boats In their at
tempts to reach the Russian guardship,
which was protected by the stone-laden
ships sunk by the Japanese In their ef
fort to block the entrance to Port Ar
thur. The guardship anchored behind
the wrecked vessels. An entrance was
opened around the foot of Golden Hill,
but the remainder of the channel wan
closed with booms, making It impossi
ble for' torpedoes to pass.
Seven hundred Russians and 100 Chi
nese mechanics are still at work in the
dockyards af Port Arthur.
Some of the torpedo attacks by the
Japanese have been almost fanatical.
Frequently they have made attacks
where success was impossible, and
when the torpedo-boats have been sunk
the Japanese have refused assistance,
either committing suicide or fighting
off their rescuers.

outing. It-, consisted . of twelve cars
and two engines. The first engine had
taken water and the train had moved

beside the tank, when the regular
train drew near. The flagman of the
special signaled the engineer of the on
coming train; but. owing to a curve In
the mad, hiB flag was not seen until
too late. It is claimed that the engineer
of the -regular train had slowed down
to about ten miles an hour before he
crashed into the special, but his en
gine tore through the rear car and
drove the forward end of that car
into the car ahead. The killed and In

The wreckage did not catch fire, and
the work of taking out the dead and

Briefly summed up, General Kuropat
kin divides such a war into two cam
paigns, one ending with the capture of
Herat and the other, after two or three
years' administration of the country,
with the capture of Kashmir, Kanda
har and Kabul. After that, says..Gen
eral Kuropatkin, the British would
find themselves without native support
in India proper.
The plan deals minutely with the
methods Russia ought to adopt to se
cure the co-operation of the Persians
and Afghans by an elaborate system
of agents and sheikhs. It estimates that
one Turkestan army corps and' one
Transcaspian corps would be reaulred
in the initial stage of the campaign,
"which I would prefer to begin in No
vember, as the weather is healthier
for the men and all Russian ports are
frozen. A casus belli can any. time
wheit required be found through a col

The Colorado and West Virginia are
the two ships nearest completion, the
Colorado. standing on June 1 at 84.9 per
cent and the West Virginia at 85.49. The
Colorado's keel was laid April 25, 1901,
and the launch took place April 25,
1903. The first unofficial builders' trial
came off July 2, at which she is said to
have averaged 22.10 knots in two runs
over the measured mile course. The
trial was solely for the purpose of try
ing the machinery and was satisfac
tory, the Niclausse boilers giving no
trouble whatever. It Is somewhat pre
mature, however, to claim for the
Colorado, as the report states, that
"she is without a Deer In the American
or any other navy." The ship was fly
ing light at a draught three to four
feet. less than when loaded to her final
trial displacement, at which an average
speed of 22 knots must be maintained
during four hours. The Colorado and \
West Virginia class are of 13.680 tons
displacement, and are 1680 tons larger
than the armored cruisers of the Cressy
class and 320 tons smaller than the
Drake type In the British navy. Six
ships of the Cressy class designed for
21 knots speed have .been completed,
and all of them exceeded the contract
speed by one-half to two-thirds of a
knot. Fouf of the Drake class designed
for 23 knots gave even better results,
and as high as 24 knots sea speed dur
ing a continuous run of over twenty
four hours is claimed for the Drake.
The steam trials in all s other navies are
more exacting than In the United
States navy, not less than eight hours
being required in the British navy. It
is therefore unsafe to predict that a
vessel running light over a measured
mile course in less than three minutes
will do better, or even as well, with 1500
tons additional weight and maintain
the former speed for four hours. The
lines of the hull are all that can be de
sired, but it is a noticeable fact that
the phenomenal ' speeds attained by
earlier vessels In our navy In excess of
contract ' have been materially reduced
since the premium system giving $25,000
for each additional one-Quarter knot
has been discontinued.
The West Virginia's keel was laid
September 16, 1901,* and the ship was
launched April 18, 1903, thus beating the
Colorado by nearly five months. The
Maryland was begun October 29, 1901.
and launched September 12. 190S. The
Colorado arid West Virginia will prob
ably be completed and turned over to
the f navy within five months, - and if
there had been no delays caused by the
Navy Department the ships would un
doubtedly have been completed within
the contract time. of three years.

tractors on the reduced price to be
paid for the three armored cruisers
and three battleships on which wood
sheathing was discarded. This change
in specifications has been the cause of
some delay, but thÂ« more serious and
costly departure from the contract was
the elimination of torpedo tubes and
subsequent decision to reinstall these
.important adjuncts to the efficiency of
battleships and cVulsers. The cost of
making this late (change is estimated
at $2,500,000, which will be borne by
the Government, and the delay to
which the builders have been subjected
will further involve the Navy Depart
ment in controversy with the con
tractors on cl.-^ms for extra compensa

of money, time and litigation is direct

Admirai Kerr is 65 years of age and
has been in the navy a little more than
fifty years, and will be promoted .to
admiral of the fleet at a yearly salary
of $10,000. Admiral Fisher joined the
navy at the age of 13 and is just 63
years old. He has a brilliant record,
having served with great distinction
in the Crimean war of 1854; China
war, 1859-60, and Egyptian war in 1882.
His salary as First Naval Lord, to

The new yacht, named the Enchan

worse failure than the Victoria and

speed of IS knots, but she only reached
ltf knots. What is still worse is the
alleged fact that the vessel roils heav

The surveying veÂ«w=els .in the British
navy are doing a vast amount of work
valuable to mercantile and military
fleets.-' /The work extends all over the
world, from the home coasts to the dis
tant regions of the Far East, from
British Columbia to the shores of West
Africa. During 1903 four vessels were
employed in the home, work and seven
abroad. The operations were ham
pered by bad weather, still, no less
than 627 miles of coast line were chart
ed and an area of 20,467 square miles
was sounded. No less than 344 rocks
and shoals were reported as dangerous
to navigation. Of these 40 were re
ported by surveying vessels, .21 by
other navy ships: 245 were notified by
colonial and foreign governments, 13
were unfortunately discovered by
striking and 12 were reported by other
vessels. The yearly expenses of the
Hydrographic Department and Coast
Survey offices is about $310,000, a sum
that is' not extravagant considering
the vast amount of work done that is
of . incalculable benefit to all maritime
nations.
LAUNCH OF A BRITISH CRUISER.
The Duke of Edinburgh, an armored
cruiser of 13,500 tons, 23,500 .horse-power
and a calculated speed of 22 1-3 knots,
was launched June 14 at the Pembroke
dockyard. Her. keel was laid February
11, 1903. The ship Is the 238th vessel
built at Pembroke. Five armored
cruisers of this type are under con
struction, two at dockyards and the
others by contract. Their main bat
teries consist of six 9.2-inch and ten 7.5
inch guns, which is considered by some
naval experts as more effective than
the armament of the United States ar
mored cruisers Tennessee and Washing
ton of 14,500 tons, carrying four 10-inch
and sixteen 6-inch guns.
In the Italian navy the battleship
Regina Elena was launched at SDezia
June 19. The battleships Vittoria Em
manuel and Roma are to be launched
in August and November, and a third,
named Napoli, will be ready for launch
ing in February next. These ships are
of the same type, size, dimensions and
speed, namely 435.5 feet length. 12.425
tons displacement, ., 20,000 horse-power
and 22 knots calculated speed.
According to a French export's es
timate, the French battleships of the
Patrie class, of 14,865 tons, require 1.1S
horse-powep- per ton displacement for.
a Bpeed of 18 knots, against 1 horse
power for the British London class, of
15,000, for a like speed. In the German
Braunschweig class, of 13,200 tons, the
horse-power is 1.21 per ton displace
-ment. For armored, cruisers of 22 to
23% knots the proportions j are: 2.15
horse-power per ton of the British
Drake class of 14.1Q0 tons. The French
Renan type, of 13,200 tons, reouires 2.8
horse-power for 23.5 knots speed. â¢ He
also contends . that French- 12-knot
cruisers require 2.1 horse-oower
against .1.67 in the British navy.
These differences are due to the
superior lines of British ships. In
the American navy . the battleships
Maine and Missouri attain a soeed
of 18 knots with 1.26 horse-Dower
per ton, and in the Georgia class, of
15,000 tons, a speed. of 19 knots is cal
culated with a horse-power of 1.27 per
ton. The California class of armored
cruisers, of 13,680 tons, will reauire 1.68
horse-power per t ton for a speed of 22
knots. â¢
CONTEST IN SHIPBUILDING.
There . la to all appearances a race
between the shipyard at Newport News
and the Cramps for the completion of
the armored cruisers West Virginia.
Maryland and . Colorado. Newport
News is building the two first named
and the Cramps ' the Colorado. " The
contracts ' for, these â¢ ships were signed
in January, 1901; the price. to-be paid
being $3,775,000 for the Maryland.
$3,885,000 for the West Virginia and
$3,780,000 for the Colorado/ and they
were to be delivered in January. 1904.

While the particulars uf the fighting
are not known, it is evident that the,
Russians made a determined stand.
The losses and the number of men en
gaged have not been reported.
On the same day the right wing of
the Japanese army southeast of Kai
ping defeated a small force of Russians
and the left wing occupied the heights
to the southeast. ,
On Thursday the entire Japanese
army forced its way closer to Kaiping,
overcoming the stubborn resistance of
the Russian infantry, cavalry and ar
tillery located in the narrow defiles.
The Russians held many strong posi
tions In the mountain passes, but de
spite their desperate resistance they
were forced to abandon them one by
one. During the night the Russians
were largely reinforced by troops
brought from the north by train, in
preparation for a big battle on Friday.
The Japanese began the .last day's
fighting at daylight with an artillery
fire from guns placed on the heights
previously captured from the Rus
sians.*"
At 9. o'clpck in, th& moaning' they
drove the Russians 'from their posi
tions and forced them into their last
line of defenses around the town. . The
Russians evidently saw that the town
was doomed, as General Oku reports
that many troops were withdrawn dur
ing the morning.
The Russians finally tooX positfon on
the tops of high precipices and again
offered a stubborn resistance. At about
noon they were forced to again with
draw, the Japanese occupying the last
line of defenses. The Japanese pur
sued the enemy, despite a severe ar
tillery fire from the Russian batteries
on the high hills to the north. The
Japanese artillery finally occupied new
positions and silenced these batteries.
In the afternoon the Japanese occu
pied the town without further resist
ance.
TOKIO, July 10.â After three days'
severe fighting, characterized by the
desperate attacks of the Japanese and
the stubborn resistance of the Rus
sians, General Oku's army occupied
Kaiping (Kaichou) last Friday, driving
the Russians northward in the direc
tion of Haieheng. The Russians had
strongly fortified the hill situated in a
semi-circle south of Kaiping. Their
forces consisted of more than 30,000
men. In his report of the engagement,
General Oku does not give any details,
but shows the difficulties of the strug
gle.
The operations began j last Wednes
day by the Japanese driving 1600 Rus

TACOMA'. July 10.â Suit brought
at North Yakima by the former hus
band of Mrs. Rudkin forms the basis of
a political sensation involving . Frank
P. ' Rudkin, Republican candidate for
the Supreme bench in this State.
Judge O. S. Morford and Rudkin
were boyhood^friends in'Ohio. Rudkin
went to school to ; Morford, who is
eight years his senior." For many
years he was a protege of . Morford.
Morford came to Yakima. and estab
lished a law practice which was sub
sequently transferred to Rudkin. Mor
ford then devoted- himself to large
farming, interests. Rudkin lived in
Morford's house by the latter's urgent
invitation. Morford at first prospered,
but several years ago found himself
in financial straits.. . He straightened
out matters by> keeping three farms
valued at $60,000 subject: to. a mortgage
of twenty-six thousand. .7 Morford then
went to Dawson-to make another-for
tune and. again. prospered. > â¢ '
The story .runs that- he sent thous
ands of dollars to "Rudkin for the use
of Morford's family,* and. to pay off
mortgages Avhich were soon satisfied
Several years ago Rudkin visited Mor
ford in Dawson, borrowing money with
which to make the campaign which
resulted in his election as Superior
Judge. Previous to this Morford had
made 'three visits home. About this
time Mrs. Morford * wrote him she
could no longer live with him, and re
questing that he return home and di
vide the property. He came out and" is
reported to have again sought Rud
y's advice. It is alleged that Rud
kwi advised him to transfer his farms
to Mrs. Morford, besides- paying her
five* thousand dollars cash, and allow
ing her to secure a divorce on the
ground of abandonment.
The contract drawn by Rudkin In
volving transfers of property was
signed by Morford in December, 1901,
and three weeks later Mrs. Morford
sued for divorce on a complaint signed
by Rudkin's brother as attorney. As
! Superior Judge Rudkin heard the un-
! contested suit and signed ,the decree,
Morford returned to.Dawsbn, and was
j bewildered a year and a half;iater to
, hear that Rudkin Â¦Â¦Â¦ had injured Mrs;
j Morford. Stories of alleged,, fondness
between the pair previous to her di
vorce then reached his ears. Morford
returned and' counseled with Judge
Reavis, former Chief Justice of Wash-
I ington. Following this he brought suit
| to annul the contract of property set-
I tlement, alleging a conspiracy between
I Mrs. Morford and Rudkin. The suit
I was tried by Judge Bell, to whom Mor
! ford's attorneys objected because of al
leged bias and strong friendship for
Rudkin. They were overruled. Judge
Bell struck from the complaint allega
tions of undue intimacy between Rud
kin and Mrs. Morford, also holding that
Morford was not entitled to the prop
erty. Morford has now appealed to the
Supreme Court, seeking a new trial.

MOKELUMNE HILL* July 10.â John
Souden, a shift Inspector at the Gwln
mine, yesterday afternoon fell from the
skip to the bottom of the shaft, a dis
tance of 2000 feet, and was killed. His
body was mangled beyond recognition.
Souden and a fellow inspector. Chris
Curovich, were going up the sklD in
specting the shaft, a dally custom, pre
paratory to lowering the 3 o'clock shift
of miners. Within .fif ty feet of the too
Curovich, who was examining his side
of the shaft, heard his partner give a
warning signal, "Look out." Turning
around, he saw Souden' s body betns
drawn between the skip and the wall
plate.
The body was crushed throueh a
space of six inches and fell below be
fore a signal could be given to stop.
The supposition is that Souden. seeing
something was wrong, thrust his head
out to examine more closely and
his head was caught between the wail
and the skip. The miners below knew
nothing of the accident until they heard
the body plunge Into the sump. Sev
eral hours passed before the head and
all the members were recovered.
Souden was 27 years old and leaves
a widow and child. He had been work

detachment near the north entrance
to Fenshui Pass. The Russians were
repulsed and the Japanese retained
possession of the entrance to the pass.
The Japanese had four men killed and
three wounded.
Colonel Lctchitsky's force marched
more than sixteen miles in a single
night, carrying the wounded back over
a mountainous road. Count Keller is

Colonel Garnetsi's column arrived at
the Japanese camp at midnight of
July 4. A Japanese picket wps sur
prised and destroyed after fighting
bravely, one Japanese killing a Jlussian
oflicpr in a sword duel.
The Russians, without pausing,
swept into the camp, carrying the
half awakened Japanese over the brow
of the hill at the point of the bayonet.
The few who escaped carried the news,
as the result of which on the next day
the Japanese brought up two regi
ments and forced a Russian retreat.
Colonel Letchitsky had a very sim
ilar experience. He caught the Jap
anese camp asleep at 2 o'clock in the
morning and carried it with the bay
onet, after a terrible slaughter and
without firing a shot.
The Russians lost heavily on the re
treat next day. but the reconnaissance
was satisfactory, as it developed the
strength and location of the Japanese
forces.
Count Keller personally accompanied
the force to Hoiyan, and from there
sent Colonel Garnets! with three com

ST. PETERSBURG, July 10.â A sen-'
sation has been caused by the publi
cation in the Russky Invalid, the army
organ, of a telegram from Emperor
William to the colonel of the Wyborg
(Finland) regiment, of which the Em
peror is honorary colonel in chief.
The Emperor congratulates the regi
ment on the prospect of meeting the
Japanese and adds that he is proud j
his regiment will have the honor of
fighting for its Emperor, the fatherland i
and the fame of the Russian army. In
concluding- the Emperor says:
"My sincere wishes accompany the
regiment. God bless its standards."
This, telegram was published only this
morning, but by evening its contents
bad become widely known and formed
the general topic of conversation. -A
considerable section of the public even
deduced from the message that Ger
many intends before long to abandon
her position as a mere onlooker with
regard -to events in the Far East.
In the diplomatic circles, while the
telegram has caused much surprise and
comment, it is immediately associated
with the approaching commercial
treaty negotiations in Berlin. It seems
to be generally understood that Russia
is prepared to make considerable tariff
concessions in exchange for the benev
olent neutrality of Germany during the
war, as well as for the assistance Ger
many is rendering in keeping the ene
mies of the Russian Government in
Germany under police surveillance.
Moreover, it has been repeatedly af
firmed that Russia desires to raise
money in Berlin.

ELKINS, W. Va., July 10. â Two
thousand persons had gathered at the
West Virginia Central and Pittsburg
Railroad station here to-day to greet
former Senator Henry G. Davis, who
arrived on his special car from the
convention at St. Louis at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. When the train pulled
in at the station the music of the
Elkins band, which headed the throng,
was drowned by the shout that went
up when the Democratic candidate for

shouts joined those of the crowd at
the station. T. W. Dailey and Senator

congratulation, to which the ex-Sena

of the honor that the convention had
conferred upon him and commenting
upon the fact that in his home town

that party lines had been lost sight of.
He spoke from the rear platform of
his car and his words were wildly
cheered.
Hundreds of those in the throng
marched to the music of the band to
the Davis home as an escort. At his
home, which is on a commanding hill
west of the town, Davis slept most of

Senator James K. Jones, the retiring
chairman of the National Committee,
made this statement: \
"The National Convention, by spe
cific resolution adopted last night,
authorized me, In fact, Instructed me,
to call the first meeting of the new
committee in New York City. Until I
call it the new committee cannot or
ganize and the meetings It has held are
unauthorized. Now let me say, forci
bly if need be. that, acting under the
convention authoritv, I shall call the
National Committee to meet in New
York City at such time as Judge Par
ker shall designate. Before I call It I
shall consult him. It would be an un
precedented thing for the new com
mittee to organize without consulta
tion with the candidate."
Just after the afternoon session
began, Taggart, who was presiding,
was asked to retire so that he need
not be embarrassed. August Belmont
The early morning meeting was not
fully attended and the object aimed at
was not accomplished. 1 It was pointed
out by Mack of New York that it
would be discourt&ous to take any ac
tion until Parker were consulted. The
Tapgart men, while not enough to
elect, suggested that Hill, Sheehan and,
Belmont, the nominee's friends, were
still here and adopted a resolution that
they be invited to meet the committee
this afternoon.
When afternoon came there were
three new complications in the way of
electing. Chairman Jones of the old
committee boldjy asserted that such
action as contemplated would be un
precedented and, in fact, illegal. It
also turned out that at a late hour the
convention | adopted a resolution
authorizing Chairman Jones of the old
committee to call the new committee
together in New York City at such time
as he might suggest.
Another obstacle was that Hill and
Sheehan left for New York at noon
and therefore could not attend the
meeting.

MAJORITY FAVORS TAGGART.
The following national committee
men, or their proxies, as designated,
were present and unanimously voted
in favor of the adoption of the reso
lution indorsing the candidacy of
Thomas Taggart for chairman:
of New York was called into the room
and asked \ to give Judge Parker's
views. He said he could not do so.
TAGGART IS INDORSED.
Colonel Guffey insisted that precedent
demanded that the committee cour
teously await Judge Parker's opinion.
"In fact," he said, "the resolution
of last night precluded any action until
Chairman Jones issued a call for New
York."
Senator, Bailey of Texas said that the
question should be settled at once. It
was customary for the committee to
meet immediately after the adjourn
ment and elect, and a resolution was
passed last Tuesday to that effect by
the convention.
"I guess," he said, "that we can have
Judge Parker's views in a few mo
ments from his friends here if they
care to. give them."
After nearly two hours of debate,
Senator Bailey offered as a compromise
that the committee adopt a resolution
indorsing the candidacy of Thomas
Taggart for chairman of the commit
tee. Mack agreed to this and the reso
lution was adopted.
Taggart of Indiana Indorsed for Chairman

Many visited the World's Fair, as by
special permission they were admitted
on Sunday, but the early hours of the
evening found the politicians again
clustered in the hotel corridors and the
tcpic of conversation seemed, by gen
eral consent, to change to statements
concerning individual physical discom
forts and the amount of sleep necessary
to restore them to a normal condition.
Then followed a general exodus and
the Union station to-night was crowded
with departing delegates.
ST. LOUIS, July 10.â Very few of the
delegates to the Democratic National
Convention left the city on the early
morning trains to-day. The unflagging
interest that had spurred them through
the long hours of the convention per
mitted them to obtain but little sleep
after Its adjournment and the hotel
ccrridors were crowded with groups of
heavy-eyed and apparently thoroughly
exhausted politicians. The events of
the past four days formed the chief
topic of conversation. All who had sat
through the weary sessions declared
that the convention just closed was one
of the greatest assemblages in the po
litical history of this country and from
the standpoint of physical endurance
was certainly one of the most enhaust
ing. Many of the delegates decided to
enjoy gome recreation and street cars
to suburban amusement parks were
crowded during the late hours of t"he

LONDON, July 11.â Several news
papers this morning print editorials re
ferring to the National Democratic
Convention in St. Louis, but most of
them merely recapitulate the events of
the convention. All of them agree
that Judge Parker's personality is in
accordance with the traditions as to
candidates for the Presidency: but. ex
cept for the expression of general sat
isfaction that silver will not be the
issue of the campaign, there are few
comments showing any particular Brit
ish opinion on the judgment of the dele
gates.
The Standard, however, declares that
Judge Parker's message to Sheehan is
a "deed which will give Parker a place
in history. Conceivably it may send
him to the White House, but it will
certainly make him a force to be reck

time to come."

Rowell F. Spence. a detective em
ployed by a Chicago agency, has re
turned to that city after obtaining iden

he had in his possession, supposed to be

train near Parachute. Colo., but. after
blowing open two safes and shootirut
one railroad employe, they obtained
only $10. A posse of cowboys was at

In the chase one of the bandits waa

as soon as he fell, was seen to shoot
himself through the head. Pictures
were taken of the dead man. Bellevinsc

been confined more than a year.
Sheriff Fox, from whom Logan es
caped, positively identified the photo
graphs as those of Logan. So did Jailer
Thomas Bell, whom Logan held up at
the point of a pistol while escaping
from Jail.
The outstanding reward for tha
bandit is variously estimated at be
tween $18,000 and $30,000. It is probabla
that the body will be exhumed and fur

carried many bullet marks. When ha
escaped from the Knoxville jail he was
under sentence of twenty years for
having brought into the State and

in the next Legislature. I expect to
win and have no thought of making a
money fight for the place. As to the
outcome, whether I win or lose, I shall
give my remaining years of activity
in public life, which may be estimated
;it seven or eight, to the cause of the
Republican party."
"1 have not spoken to Mr. Herrin
on the subject and have no assurance
that' he favors my candidacy and no
intimation that he is against me. If
he should elect, however, to support
pome other a5pirant our personal
friendship would not be ruffled at the
close of the campaign."
Last night at the Bohemian Club
iir. Knight spoke frankly concerning
his candidacy, saying that he was in
the tight to win. He spoke of his ser
vices jn the Republican cause, remark
ing that he made sixty-two speeches
in the gubernatorial campaign of 1ST0,
which contest resulted in the election
of George C. Perkins Governor of Cali
fornia. In every subsequent campaign
Mr. Knight said he had taken the
etump for the party and had never
been paid a dollar by the Republican
State Central Committee for his ser
vices.
Mr. Knight was asked if he had any
assurance of the support of W. F.
Herrin, and in response to the question
said:
As forecasted by The Call, the con
test for United States Senator to suc
ceed Thomas R. Bard Is enlivened by
the introduction of GÂ«orge A. KnighCs
candidacy. The new aspirant for Sen
taoria.1 honors makes definite an
nouncement of his position in the
campaign. It is noted also that Frank
I\ Flint of Los Angeles has entered the
race for the Senatorship. All the
fiigns are indicative of an animated
iiiid interesting contest. The political
storm center is in the south, where
Senator Bard, Henry T- Oxnard and
Frank P. Flint are deploying their
forces.
Chatterly's friends declare that the
examination was a "put up job" and
that he should have been examined
on cotton machinery, which comprise
the principal imports here.
BOSTON, July 10.â A sensation has
been created in customs import cir
cles, here by\^*ie announcement that
Acting Examiner of Machinery George
Chatterly of San Francisco had failed
to pass the civil service examination
here for the position of permanent in
spector of imported machinery. His
marks totaled only 27.50 per cent
against 77 per cent obtained by William
I. Hodges, his chief competitor.
Chatterly was appointed acting ex
'aminer in place of Colonel William W.
Castle, dismissed, having been brought
on from San Francisco for that pur
pose. He is an expert on cotton ma
chinery, and Appraiser Snelllng of
Boston has gone on record as saying
that his services here were invaluable.
But his experience has been mainly
with cotton machinery, while the ex
amination was conducted principally
on woolen and silk machinery, with
which he is unfamiliar.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, July 10.â Going the
round in Washington to-day was a
story alleged to reveal the inside facts
about the telegrsjm with which Judge
Parker threw the Democratic conven
tion into turmoil.
According to this story August Bel
mont and Wiliam F. Sheehan, realiz
ing that a fatal mistake had been made
In allowing the omission of a gold
plank from the party platform, agreed
that Judge Parker should -counteract
the baneful effect upon business inter
ests. This resulted in the drafting of
a telegram which, it is said, was sent
to Esopus and elicited the telegram re
ported to have been sent by Judge
Parker to Senator Carmack. .flatly de
clining to run upon the platform with
out a sound money plank.
Senator Carmack denied having re
ceived such a telegram, but the Wash
ington version is that he did be
cause Bclmont and Sheehan at once
declared that Judge Parker had over
done the thing and immediately sent
him another message outlining the
message from Judge Parker which
was read to the convention and which
merely announced his gold standard
views and his willingness to decline
the nomination if these views were
unacceptable to the majority.
The first telegram, it is said, was
sent to Carmack to prevent the sus
picion that it was a part of a scheme
on the part of the New York dele
prates. Senator Carmack, taken entire
ly by surprise, it is supposed dis
closed its contents to some one before
Eelmont and Sheehan, learning how
dangerous their work really was,
hastened to suppress it and arranged
the second message.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Very soon after it had been sent the
superintendent of the Western Union
Telegraph Company in New York
called up the Esopus operator and re
quired him to personally verify the
original telegram by a visit to Judce
Parker himself. The delivery of the
message in St. Louis, it appears, was
being delayed until the authenticity of
the dispatch could be proved beyond
discussion. The operator called Judge
Parker's house on the telephone and,
insisted upon talking with the Judjre
himself (whose voice he recognized)
and told him of the situation. At Judge
Parker's request the operator read the
message to the Judge, and, upon the
latter's assurance that it was all risht.
St. Louis received'word to deliver it to
Sheehan.
MESSAGE IS VERIFIED.
Judge Parker has not yet received the
telegram which the St. Louis conven
tion voted should be sent to him . in
reply to his dispatch addressed to
William F. Sheehan, in which he de
clared his allegiance to the gold stand
ard. While i| has not yet reached him
in any formal way, he is acquainted
with its wording, the text of it having
been communicated to him at Rosemont
last night by the press as soon as it
had been adopted by the convention,
together with the main (acts of the bat
tle over the question and the details
of the vote.
It is now known that Judge Parker's
telegram to Sheehan was sent from the
Western Union Telegraph office at
Esopu3 and the story of the precau
tions taken, both to keep it secret and
to verify its authenticity before it was
delivered, constitute a remarkable
chapter in the story of this extraordi
nary political incident.
Judge Parker's coachman, Robinson,
took the original message to the West
Shore station at Esopus at 11:30 o'clock
yesterday and delivered it to the West
ern Union operator there with im
pressive caution as to its secrecy. The
message was addressed' to William F.
Sheehan at the Jefferson Hotel. St.
Louis. i
"I congratulate you and the party on
your nomination for the office of Vice
President." .
THAT FAMOUS TELEGRAM.
Telegrams of congratulation for
Judge Parker continued to arrive.
Among those reclved to-day were the
following:
From Cord Meyer, chairman of the
Democratic State Committee: "After
receipt of your message to Sheehan and
final action of the convention, I hasten
to congratulate you heartily on your
nomination. Our work in New York
is lightened and success assured.?
From Arthur P. Gorman Jr. at St.
Louis: "Maryland delegates congratu
late you upon your splendid victory."
From United States Senator George
Turner of Washington State at St.
Louis: "SIncerest congratulations and
confident prediction of victory."
Judge Parker to-night sent the fol
lowing telegram of congratulation to
Henry G. Davis, who was nominated
for the Vice Presidency:
This afternoon the Democratic nomi
nee for President spent his leisure time
seated on his veranda with a number
of friends. .
Judge Parker's visitors, John B. Mc-
Donald and Judge Hatch, had remained
with him until 3 o'clock this morning
receiving bulletins, and then departed
for New York.
CHATS WITH HIS FRIENDS.
ESOPUS, N. Y., July 10.â In spite of
the very unusual hour at which Judge
Alton B.' Parker retired this morning
after receipt of the news from St.
Louis, he was prompt in his departure
for church at Kingston to-day. He
drove with Mrs. Parker to the Episco
pal Mission Church of the Holy Cross
at Kingston, where his son-in-law, Rev.
Charles M. Hall, is rector. Mr. Hall
had been attending: tthe St. Louis con
vention, and in his absence Rev. Dr.
Edward Cooper, rector of the Church
of St. John- the Divine at Hasbrouck
Heights. N. J., conducted the services.
Judge Parker assisted in taking up the
collection. â¢
The sermon included no reference to
matters civic'or political. After the ser
vice Dr. Cooner was asked if he had
Judge Parker's silence in mind in his
reference to the eloquence of life rather
than lips when he said:
"It is not the eloquence of life that
speaks as loudly or counts as much as
the life itself of a man."
The doctor smiled, but declined to
say.

*She entertained but little for an
heiress to a million, took small account
of charities, held no very deep interest
in menâ that is, in the individual man â
and appeared to dwell in a little dark
world all within herself, i It was in that
little dark - world, peopled by unreal
creatures, wljo neither spoke to her, nor
loved her, nor made merry with her,
that she grew silent and gloomy. Then
came the. sleeplessness and the pains.
They always come with the peopling of
the brain with unreal creatures. There
are those who say that the unhappy
maid drank from her mother's breast
the substance of the unreal people
and with the growing. years they took
shape. Loved and honored with fine
friendships, and possessed of rare
beauty, there was not in life that un
purchasable thing, happiness.
The 'inanimate body, its soul â¢fet rest,
will start on its trip homeward to-mor
row.
The death of Bertha Dolbeer, beauti
ful, cultured, wealthy and loved, smote
her friends a cruel blow, a blow from
which they have not rallied, though the
newspapers of yesterday morning bore
the awful tidings to them. Nor will
they fully feel the loss that has fallen
upon them until there comes the bat
tered bodv of her who left them but a
short time ago to mingle with the
throngs in European capitals.
On the day of leaving as she bade
adieu to a dear friend she whispered to
her, "I dread this trip. I fear it. I
wish I might withdraw, but I cannot."
A change of scene had been recom
mended for her as an alterative to her
depression, which of late had been as
suming a serious persistency. Going to
London, she found life there dull, and
cutting short her stay she crossed to
Paris, hoping the joy of the boule
vardler might enter into her soul and
lift jt from the depths, but the hope
vanished in sleepless nights and haunt
ed days. With youth, beauty and
wealth, joy was not to be lured into the
darkened chambers of her soul, and
sickening of the elusive chase she de
termined to return home. And it was
on this homeward trip that, maddened
by pain in her head and sorrow at her
soul, she made the fatal leapâ to rest.
And who is there with aught but pity
in his or her heart for the suffering
soul who flung away her,young'life in
a mad moment of pain?
' As a character-study," Miss Dolbeer
had always been interesting to her
friends. Unlike other girls from her
birth, she grew to womanhood with her
individuality unchanged. Truthful,
frank, straightforward, economical (in
spite of her $7000 of monthly income),
self-reliant, phlegmatic, wholly devoid
of enthusiasm, unless it be concerning
athletics, in which she. manifested some
interest, she was a type of woman
wholly unlike any other similarly situ
ated. -:^

1016 Broadway, July 10.
The Oakland boys who claim to have
been offered commissions in the Chinese
army in consideration of drilling Chi
nese sufficiently to put them on a foot
ing with European soldiers are won
dering how far the invitation may point
to a revolution of the yellow races
against the Europeans.
I Ralph J. Faneuf and T. J. Thompson,
both Philippine veterans, have received
messages indicating that the Chinese
reform party is trying to obtain the
services of well-trained American sol
diers to take charge of the reorganiza
tion of the Chinese army. These young
men are sturdy young Americans and
they are trying to find out from what
source these overtures come. If they
come, even indirectly, from the Chi-,
nese Government, they suggest inter
national questions.
The first word received in Oakland
in regard to these overtures was from
H. J. Kemper, secretary of the army
of the Philippines. Kemper wrote to
Thompson and Faneuf, telling them a
company of Chinese was to be formed
in Oakland and setting forth what is
deemed to be the offer of the Chinese
Government, that the American drill
masters should receive commissions in
the Chinese army while the drilled Chi
nese should become the non-commis
slolied officers of the reorganized Chi
nese army. The young soldiers to
whom this proposition has been made
are trying to find out how far they may
become implicated in International
complications.
Ralph J. Fanuef is at present em
ployed in the United States postoffice
department in Oakland. He was in the
Hawaiian Islands at. the outbreak of
the - Spanish-American war. A young
man of strenuous tendencies and eager
to fight for the country of his birth, he
enlisted in the Tenth Pennsylvania Vol
unteers when they stopped at, the isl
ands. : He served through the war with
credit to himself and the flag and made
a, record with General Bell, then a
colonel. Thompson, now commander of
Colonel Liscum Post of Veterans Qt the
Spanish-American War, was connected
with the hosDi tal service in the islands.
This is what Fanuef said to-night:
"Camp Colonel Liscum of the Span
ish-American War Veterans "is in re
ceipt of a very peculiar communication
from- Mr. Kemper at Los Angeles. This
communication was originally sent to
Mr.. Thompson, the commander of our
local camp, and then turned over to
me. I do not know what it means, but
it would seem that the Chinese Govern
ment is looking I for American soldiers
to . reorganize its army, j They , offer
American soldiers commissions in v the
Chinese army, and the | men they may
drill in this country are to have j non
commissioned posts under. them."
Commander Thompson confirmed Fa
rmers . statement. . Both the veterans
4 are convinced that the Chinese Govern
ment is ' seeking * American "soldiers -for
the reorganization of Its army."

Dispute Over Who Should

in /Preventing Marriage
ALAMEDA, July 10.â Cupid and
Christopher* Grau, a. Park-street no
tion dealer,, are at outs and all be
cause the girl whom Grau secured a
license to marry declined to become
his bride when he refused to pay for
her wedding "trousseau. At least, that
is the chief reason that Grau gives
why he it not a bridegroom, as his
friends expected he would be when he
secured the necessary legal permit to
marry Miss Juanita Lewis.
Grau still has his marriage license
and to-day asserted that he would try
it on another girl, and placed the fol
lowing notice in the window of his
store: "Wantedâ-A young lady with
$1000 to invest in this business. Ob
ject, matrimony if dispositions are
congenial."
Yesterday Grau had a: clearance
sale of marked-down, love-scented en
velopes and paper that he decided to
get rid of when Miss Lewis informed
him that she did not wish" to take
his name. Before the auction Grau
posted the following in a conspicuous
place in his display window:
"On account of a disappointment in
marriage I will sell out this entire sup
ply of June wedding paper, which I
intended to use myself. Very fine for
invitations, love letters and billet
deaux." To-day Grau had but three
boxes left, and, says that he expects
a run on the store to-morrow..
In speaking of his matrimonial af
fairs Grau said: "I bought; a license
to marry Miss Lewis, but after I had
obtained it some Â¦ of .my enemies told
her parents .that I -had several chil

before, but ray wife 'died, leaving me

In an announcement Just published
at the university it is pointed out that
there is nowhere a more inviting geo
logical field than that which . lies im
mediately at the gates of the univer
sity itself, i In addition to this there
is the whole phenomena of California
that offers itself for study. Th<; pos
sibilities are limitless. . In paleontol
ogy and historical geology California (
offers immense material for the student
contemplating engaging in research.
Almost the entire geological column
from Cambrian to Quaternary is rep
resented by fossiliferous horizons and
many of the more important problems
relating to the geological positions and
faunal relations of the State remain
unsolved.
The laboratories and museums of the
department are well equipped for re
search and new materials and appara
tus are being added yearly. There are
20,000 specimens of minerals at the dis
posal of the, student and "all the rock
types are represented in the petro
graphical collections.
With such opportunities for research
and study offered to the student, the
university authorities hope to attract
men from all over the country and thus
to establish the graduate school upon
a firm basis.
VISITING CLERGYMEN
PREACH IN' OAKLAND
Berkeley Office, San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, July 10.
In order to increase its rreight hand
ling facilities, which have lately be
come overtaxed on account of the big
advance in the volume of freight traf
ficked through Oakland, the Southern
Pacific Company is making arrange
ments to purchase a long stretch of^
land on the water front of Berkeley,"
between the north and south bound
aries. The railroad has been farced
to take this step so that the burden on
the trackage on Third street may be
relieved and . it has set Us agents to
work bonding all the property it may
find useful in its enlarging scheme. So
quietly have the agents worked that
property owners did not suspect the
hand of the Southern Pacific until a
day or two ago when a real estate
agent, through . whom negotiations
were being carried on lor the purchase
of one piece of land, inadvertently let
the cat out of the bag. The corpora
tion went ahead stealthily because it
feared opposition and high prices from
the property owners, but now that
practically all the little deals are com
pleted, there is nothing to fear. The
property owners, too, realize that it
is now too late for them to interfere.
The land that the Southern Pacific
will acquire through its bonding scheme
all lies west of its main line tracks. on
Third street in West Berkeley, stretch-
Ing between. Addison street and Folger
avenue. It is a strip that lies between
the tracks and the bay and varies in
width according to the indentations
of the shore line." In some places it is
a block wide and ip others it is less
than a hundred feet.
For- this strip the Southern Pacific
expects" to pay something between $80,
000 and J100.000. The money will be
distributed among the following own
ers of the land: H. W. Carpentier', J.
A. Heywood, Mrs. Jane- Thomas, Che
ney & Berry, the Avery estate, the
Grayson estate. Flora D. Jones and J,
A. Boardman.
When title to the property is secured
the corporation will begin a series of
improvements that' will call for the
expenditure of perhaps another $100,
000 or more. Among other things, it
will connect the track that now runs
on Second street, between Addison
street and the north boundary line,
with the main line on Third street.
This will be a costly" project that will
require considerable piling and filling,
as at the point where the connection
will be made, between Addison street
and Allston way, the land is quite nar
row and near the bay. ' , -1 . .
The railroad has two good reasons
for wishing to increase its trackage
in West Berkeley. The primary one
is to relieve the congestion on its pres
ent trackage, but the other is almost
as necessary and it is to retain the
traffic diverted io It by the big manu
facturing plants in the district. There
is a soap works in West Berkeley, a
furniture factory, a candy factory, a
chemical works and three or four other
big Industries that need to be nursed
along, and the Southern Pacific seeks
to prevent the Santa Fe from cutting
into a field that has been such a source
of income for a long time.

SCIENCE TO FIGHT
THE ARMY WORM PEST
Promoters of Scenic Way Secure Con
sent to Run Through Garber and
Palache Estates.
BERKELEY, July 10. â The boule
vard skirting the Berkeley hills, for
which the people of Berkeley have
been working for more than a year,
is about to become a reality. Con
sent for a right of way through the
property of Judge John Garber and
the Palache estate has at last been se
cured, so that now the last barrier to
the project has been removed. Sur
veyors started the work of marking
off a road through the estates this
week.
The boulevard, ..when completed,
will begin, on Spruce street, run
through the Scenic tract to the north
gate of the university grounds back
of the university buildings, along
Piedmont avenue to Warring street;,
through the Garber and Palache es
tates into Claremont avenue, and
thence to Oakland.
Farmers of Kern County Appeal to
Agriculturists at the University
, to Help Them.
BERKELEY, July 10.â The farmers
of Kern Cpunty are sufferers! from the
ravages of the army worm, a little in
sect that gets its name' from the fact
that iÂ± moves in dense masses. -So de
structive are the little bugs , that the
farmers have appealed to the authori
ties of the agricultural department of
the University of California,^to assist
in their extermination. . -
The worm lives off the roots of fruit
trees, berry bushes and grape vines
and burrows into them underground
to get at. the most nutritious parts.
Once\ they attack a growth it means
certain death and loss to the farmers.
Invents a New Trolley.
OAKLAND, July 10. â John Q.
Brown, assistant general manager of
the Oakland Transit Company^, has just
been granted a patent on the new dia
mond trolley, how in use on the Key
Route motor cars. Mr. Brown's inven
tion .is very simple, consisting of a
diamond-shaped spring frame, which
is surmounted by a brass roller two
feet long, the roller forming the con
tact with the overhead wire. The ad
vantage of Mr. Brown's invention is
that there is no small wheel to slip
from the wire.

During the fiscal year Just ended
nearly sixteen hundred houses were
erected in Oakland and this means that
several thousand new people have
taken up their residence in the city
with the intention of making their pery
mtnent homes here. This activity in
building operations has, of course, giv
en a stimulus to many other branches
of industry. Mills have been, and are
eull, running day and night, with a
double shift of men, in a.n effort to
ram the demand for building material
for homes now in course of construc
tion.
On? of the most important of these
improvement? is involved in the Oak
land Water Front Company's plans to
leclaim ten acres of tide land adjacent
to Adam? wharf. The company has
just let a contract to the Hyde Hargls
Construction Company for the bulk
heading of the Land, which will be re
claimed by filling in' sand from the
channel in front. The reclaimed land
will be occupied with lumber wharves
and piers. .. .
A CITY IN* ACTION*.
In spits of. the usual 'midsummer mi
gration of citizens of Oakland to pleas
vt-e resorts, local and suburban real es
tate dealers report a fairly good mar
ket, and many inquiries for business
and residence property, and all of them
are weil satisfied with the progress
made during the year. William J. Lay
mance. president of the. Laymance Real
Estate Company, made the following
statement concerning the present con
dition bf this ctty and its suburbs:
itekland is not only a city in size but in
action. Afwr trre greatest Fourth of July
tfjebraticn in its history, It may be likened
t6 all large cities in the summer season. The
Tar-ople will ' be found in all of the summer
resorts in the East. West. North and South,
an indication that Oakland citizens have been
Lnsy ar.d prosperous during the year
to be able to tajce needed r*st.
ReÂ«j estate salt-* have, therefore, not been
Â£o numerous as in tbe early spring. There is,
howev. r, splendid evidence - of activity, not
czAv- in residence building but along substan
t'al industrial lines. Throughout the city
there nevÂ«Â»r was eo much rood street work
and street railway construction, or so much
tiuildinp of blocks, small stores, fiats, room
ing hcus*.s. apartment houses, enlargement of
preMTt nwrroantile and manufacturing enter
rrise* as at present. I doubt if there is any
better bufintfcs barometer to judge of. a city's
real Â«olid grewth "over a, 1*Dod of - ten* years
than its strÂ»?eV railway earnings. It measures
the growth of pro--T>erity. Tne announcement
this we*k thai. .OtkiiiDiie street railway sys
tem is iÂ«yinÂ£ C_ i*-r cent net on $12,000,000,
wfcÂ«?re t^n years ajro it was not paying on
ti.0uo.O00. is masnincent evidence of growth.
Another tinpsrtast announcement this week
is the interact manifested by the great railway
rnrnagprs in providing Oakland with adequate
pesf-PTijrpr and shipping facilities. The. South
ern Pacific Railroad Company's new freight
d*-pot. now building in \Yf*t Oakland, will be
th<* lars^t west- of the Missouri River. The
new narrow pauge d*pot, the new Key route's
fÂ«Try with its additional two new ferry-boats
and the plans of the Southern Pacifle for
FUbFtituttng 'electricity on the Seventh -street
local lines, will within this year assure Oak
land the finest rajHd transit nervice to be
found in any city in the United States.
IMPROVING SAXTA FE TRACTS.
The following is from Holcomb, Breed
& Bancroft: f
' The summer vacation, period has apparently
not affected in the Sea*t the activity and sale
of Key IUnjte lots in the "Santa Fe" tract*.
A lively interest is shown in this location In
the heart of Greater Oakland by people now
living in San Fraricisco, who are fait discov
ering the advantages of owning modern, ar
tiitic homes, costing, with 40-foot lots, 52000 to
SoOCO. within twenty-eight or thirty minutes of
San Francisco and with a 5-cent fare. Not only
are Ban Francisco people seeking to save them
selves the expense of high rents in the city by
buying these lots with a view of building, but
many residents of Oakland are improving the
opportunity of obtaining building sites In this
new and very desirable home center, which
will, eoon.be thickly built up with attractive,
up-to-date houses. All street work is done by
thÂ« owner of the tracts. This includes grad
ing, curbing, guttering, eewering. sidewalks
ana palms planted along the sidewalk line.
Lot buyers do not Ehare any part of this ex
pense and they have the certain knowledge that
all rtrwt work will be Immediately completed
and that their homes will have. all the modern
advantages of jjas, electricity, etc
A large part of the Â«reet work is already
crmpleted and more than 100 men with teams
may now be seen engaged on Santa Fe Tract
No. 6, now being cp^ned for sale. These tracts
extend from Fifty-first etreet to Sixty-fourth,
and from the Key Route line on the west for
â¢everal blocks toward the Berkeley hills.
The Santa. Fe Tract No. 5 comprise* some
cirteen blocks and parts of blocks, extending
(ram Fifty-eighth street to Sixty-fourth, and
east from the Key Route on Adeline etreet.
ThlÂ«, property I* close to the Berkeley local

XEWCOMI&IS.IX BERKELEY.
' BERKELEY. July 10.â From infor
mation that has been received by the
firm of Cheney & Berry it would seem
that Berkeley is about to get the bene
fit of a movement already begun anibng
roany people of Southern California to
ccme to the section of the State about
the bay. -Discouraged over their losses
due to the lack of water. Southern Cal
ifornians are coming north and many
of .them will settle in the university
city. J. C. Rudplph, who recently pur
chased a home in Berkeley, says that
all the south is talking about Berkeley
as the ideal place, for homes. â¢
â¢ Cheney & Berry have been selling a
rimber of lots and homes in the Crys
tal Springs tract, which borders on
Grove street, in the neighborhood of
Dwight way. The firm has sold no less
than fifteen houses lately and all "but
â¢two of them went to newcomers. They
consist tnostly of five and seven room
houses. , , Â¦ â¢;.
Lyman Allen negotiated a number of
sales in different parts of town to out
side purchasers intending to make their
homes in Berkeley. Among these are:
Carrie E. -Wilmans, eight-room house
en Ktna street: Xelson Kofoid. father
Qt Professor Kofoid of the University
The police are doing the best they can
under the conditions. The building Is old and
out of date. It is a disgrace to the city that
such a place as this prison in its present state
should exist. Present conditions cannot be
remedied in the building as it stands.
After a careful insi>ection. I can sÂ«ee nothing
to be done except to reconstruct the Interior
somewhat. In order that room may be ob
tained for the women and the Juveniles. By
constructing a small building outside, along
th*> west wall of the Jail, some j additional
space for prison use may be gained. The mat
ter will be given into the hands of the City
Council as soon as the are made.
Mayor Olhey_expressed himself strong
ly concerning the conditions; : bu,t said
only temporary changes could be made
pending .the construction of a new City
Hall and a modern prison. The Chief of
Police has been instructed to turn over
his plans and estimates to Councilman
Pendleton, who will submit them to the
City Council as soon as possible.
The Mayor" said:
Attention wag called to the fact that
five juvenile. prisoners, the youngest a
boy 10 years old, were confined in the
regulation prison cells because there is
no fit room outside of the barred holes
In the wall for this class of Inmates. A
girl 15 years old is among these.
Further investigation disclosed the
inadequate sanitary arrangements.
There are only two bath tubs in the
jail, one bf. which must accommodate
fifty male Drisoners. The other is for
women's use. There has been no alter
ation or improvement made in the jail
for many years.
. The" Mayor found that the prison was
seriously overcrowded, even in summer
time, when the number of occupants is
greatly under the grist of unfortunates
that is turned in during the winter
months. In the women's quarter the
Mayor found eleven occupants, al
though the ward has barely proper ac
commodation for live persons*
"The City Prison is not fit for human
beings to live in," declared Mayor War
ren Olney to-day after he and City
Councilman B. H. Pendletorj had made
a thorough inspection of the jail. The
Mayor was particularly impressed with
the lack of facilities for proper care of
women and juvenile offenders. In order
that temporary improvements in the
conditions shall be made the Mayor di
rected: Chief of Police Hodgkins to pro
cure estimates immediately as to the
cost ot reconstructing a part of the
prison, with "enlargement along the
west side,. for use until a new City Hall
shall have been built:

The hotel committee, which has its
main office .at the "Templar, headquar
ters, will", establish 'branches .. at the
ferry depot. and .the one at.-Townsend
and Third streets, fully equipped with
telegraph,' telephone and' a corps of
messengers, and be ready to \_ assign.
and pilot every â¢ Sir' Knight arriving
unassigned â¢ to- suitable j quarters. The
transportation, reception; 'and. escort
committees will- co-operate with: the"
hotel committee. The system thus far
is deemed ' perfect .for' the comfort of
the visitors and no hitch is anticipated
in properly. assigning ; ,.tevery man,
woman and child to ' rooms upon ar
rivaL Chairman Growall is still "en-.
deavoring to secure* absolute -comfort
All of . the larger hotels will send
clerks up the road to meet irfcoming
Sir Knights and make arrangements
with those who j have, neglected to se
cure rooms in advance, and with .par
ties or groups that have failed to spe
cify particulars in asking for Â¦- rooms.
The clerks will have complete : lists of
each commandery- that- is coming, and
the places where they will be located,
either as Individuals, families, groups,
drill corps and. bands. . Copies of. these
lists will also .be placed at all hotels
for the information of the guests, â¢
TO 3IEET VISITORS.
The committee in charge, of which
Sir Knight W. L. Growall is chair
man, has thus far placed over 15,000
Sir Knight3 and members of their
families. As many more are expected
to come, though they have not yet
reported to the committee. Advices
received from different sources give
assurance that fully 'as many more
will make the pilgrimage to the Gold
en Gate and will have to be provided
for, and that before the great com
pany shall arrive that* is sure to come
from the interior of California up and
down the coast and from all sections
of the Pacific Slope.
The parade will be the most impos
ing demonstration ever seen in San
Francisco, while the competitive drill
by the crack drill corps of the United
States will be held on the Golden Gate
Park recreation grounds and will be
free to all spectators. The vast throng
of people that will be attracted by
those two events alone will certainly
remain in the, city a few days and
must necessarily be reckoned with.
After engaging every available room
in the hotels, lodging and boarding
houses, the committee, has obtained
the services of a room renting agency
In securing comfortable quarters ' in
the most desirable locations and at
the most reasonable rates. Contracts
are still being made almost ever^' day
for parties of from 150 to single indi
viduals for from four to ten days.
Persons having desirable rooms,
either in hotels, apartment, rooming
or private houses may list them at the
agency, 1104 Market street, without
paying commission fee or any charge
whatever.
Conservative estimates, based on
careful calculation, places the number
of persons who will visit this city dur
ing the coming conclave of Knights
Templar at 100,000 and the most com
plete arrangements are being made
for housing and caring for all who
come. The attendance will doubtless
exceed that of any previous function
held in San Francisco.
The excursion committee has made
arrangements with all transportation
companies for special rates for daily
excursions on September 7, 8, 9 and 10
via the Southern Pacific Company's
lines to Del Monte, Monterey, Pacific
Grove, Big, Trees, Santa Cruz, Vallejo,
Napa, St. Helena, San Jose and Palo
Alto. Round-trip tickets at one and
one-third of the regular fare will be
sold to all points in California, with
stop-over privileges, to holders of ex
cursion â¢ tickets and those accompany
ing them. The Santa Fe route will also
sell round-trip tickets at one and one
third of the regular ratâ¢ to any point
in California. The California North
western Railway will sell round-trip
tickets to any point on the line north
of San Rafael at one fare. The North
Shore Railway Company will make the
same arrangements, and will also have
special excursions for each day to Mill
Valley, Mount Tamalpais and San Ra
fael. The Lake Tahoe Railway Trans
portation Company, the Yosemlte Stage
and Turnpike Company and the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company have made
an exceptionally low rate for all tourists
holding Templar excursion tickets.
It has now been definitely determined
that- the competitive : drill will be open
to, all. regular' Knights Templar.: drill
corps throughout ,the. United States and
.Canada,, with 'the exception of Califor
nia, the host on that occasion, Â¦ and* will
be held' on -the "baseball, grounds {of
Golden Gate. Park on Wednesday. Sep
tember" 7, .open .to ; the public and free
to all spectators. The prizes ; will; be
distributed, on the stage of the. Grand
Opera-house on Thursday evening, Sep
tember 8. The Knights [ Templar^have
secured the Grand Opera-house for two
weeks to produce" Chinese plays," but the
entertainment ; committee gives j way, to
the drill committee for that evening.
THE P1UZE DRILLS.
The ladies' Â¦ reception , committee has
outlined Its programme for the week.
It will Invite Reuben H. Lloyd, past
grand master of the order, to deliver
the address of welcome on the first
evening. To the ladies has been as
signed the task of supervising the deco
rating and ornamenting of the apart
ment's at the Palace Hotel reserved'for
the Grand -Commandery^ of California,
the Grand Encampment of the United
States and the Great Priory of England
and Wales. The executive committee
has appropriated a liberal amount for
that purpose, because it is desired to
show California ,to the best advantage.
The choicest flowers will "be sent daily
from: Golden Gate Park and from many
private gardens during the stay of the
visitors. . . . -
The transportation committee has
made arrangements with all railroad
companies to have the special trains
run on schedule time and that they
reach this city as near the time indi
cated In their itineraries as possible.
The transfer companies have made spe
cial provisions to receive baggage and
deliver promptly immediately upon and
after arrival, so that there shall be no
delay. Members of the transportation
committee Avill be at the depots and as
sist in every way to have the baggage
promptly attended to and V assist the
reception committee as much as pos
sible.
for every Sir Knight and for those
who shall come with the fraters at the
most reasonable rates. The ordinary
rates will prevail at all hotels, restau
rants and boarding-houses. '
Growall began the work of taking
care of the visitors nearly two and a
half years ago, and the system is as
perfect as zeal a/id human ingenuity
can possibly make it. He was assisted

During the afternoon the Claftin
University jubilee singers rendered
several fine selections. Dr. Freden
hacen addressed a congregation at the
First United Presbyterian Church yes
terday morning, and delivered an ad
dress at the Howard-street Methodist
Church last night.
In the course of his remarks yester
day afternoon, the doctor dwelt on the
fact that .the criminals were mostly
ycung- men found among the homeless
ard friendless. He said that the crim
inal was the result of two things â
heredity and environment â and that all
ehould bear in mind that the hearts
beating beneath the stripes were hu
man. He advocated the changing of
the workshops of prisons into class
rooms for the instruction of the crim
inals, and closed with an appeal to the
oudience to support the California
branch both morally and financially.
Several years ago Dr. Fredenhagen
â¢was made aware of the cold reception
given to the discharged prisoners of
the various State prisons, and resolved
to devote ail his life work to the re
claiming of criminals who wished to
begin over again. His wife Joined him
and was his constant partner in this
great work. Starting with a small
house, which they rented, with the pur
pose of aiding discharged criminals,
the society, with the aid of influential
tr.en, soon spread throughout the na
tion. In addition to its gTeat work of
helping *he unfortunate, the society
has succeeded in effecting many prison
reforms. Dr. Fredenhagen, who is the
general superintendent uf the society,
is here for the purpose of helping to
organize a California branch.
The members of the Young Men's
Christian Association, their men
friends and many strangers, turned
out in force yesterday afternoon to a
lecture given by the Rev. E. A. Freden
tia^en. Dr. Fredenhagen addressed the
assemblage on the work done by the
Society of the Friendless, whose real
object la the redemption of the crim
inal'classes.

"Confound the railroads!" exclaimed
Suburbs,' as he entered the office an
hour late and took off his coat. â¢
"Train late again, I suppose?"
asked Townley.
. "Not at all. For the first time In
six months the measly thing was on
time, and. of course, I missed it."â
Town Topics.
Local milkmen have become decidedly more tractable
to the demands which the Board of Health has made
upon them for the proper sanitation of dairies and the
purity of the liquid most frequently misnamed milk. It
will soon be the public's turn to take part in this vitally
important controversy and to determine by experience
whether or not this new reform is simply the repetition
of an old story of imposition.
THE DAY WE CELEBRATED.
Spoke in Wrong Ear.
A certain young man about town Is
afflicted with the extremely bad habit
c-f borrowing money from his friends
and of never repaying the loan. His
reputation on that score is generally
known and on that account many of
his friends get out of his way if they
see him coming first.
One day an elderly friend of his
acquaintance- met him in the street
before he could dodge behind the near
est telegraph pole to escape his impor
tunities. Now the elderly one is rather
deaf so far as his right ear is con

his left. He braced himself for the
"touch," which he knew was inevitable,
as his young frierM approached him.
"Hello, governor," said the latter,
grabbing his hand and addressing him
self to the right ear. "I am a little
shfrrt to-day. Can you accommodate
me with the loan of ten dollars?"
"I can't hear very well in this ear;
go 'round to the other," said the partly
deaf man.
The young man did as he was bid
and speaking into his friend's left ear,
said:
"I say, old chap, can you let me have
$20?"
The "old chap" winced as he heard
the second request for the increased
loan, and as he handed over the dou
ble eagle sorrowfully said:
"Dear me. I wish you had spoken in
the left ear in the first place."
Men as Projectiles,
A Singhalese newspaper published
in Colombo, Ceylon, is tired of the
paucity of news about the war and in
order to regale its readers it now and
then manufactures some, of which the
following is a sample â a translation
by the Ceylon Times:
"The Sultan was communicated
with regarding an approaching con
flict and, being a great friend of the
Japanese monarch, he sent a specially
trained company of swordsmen, each
of whom with a sword In his hand is
shot away from the mouth of a run
at the enemy Just as ordinary shrap
nel would be. On arrival among; the
enemy he makes short work of them
by his sword play. These swordsmen
are now fighting for Japan and gain
ing victories."

THE general movement against the toy pistol
proved ineffective in keeping down the number of
Fourth of July accidents. The reports next morning
from a small part of the country, brought the details of
fifty accidents causing fifteen deaths and with the lock
jaw returns to come. The toy pistol and did-not-know
it-was-loaded shotgun were in evidence in several States
and Territories making jocund the grave digger and
bringing joy to the undertaker. The rocket's red glare
injured the insurance companies by over-glaring on a
great many buildings, and even the fizzy pinwheel
started things going in several towns, resulting in a. fine
crop of burns, blisters and burials.

Royalty Prefers Partners.
That royal women are so passionately
fond of dancing is not to be wondered
at since It is only within a compara
tively recent period that the rigorous
etiquette by which they have been sur
rounded has been modified to the point
where it is permissible, in a game of
golf or tennis, or any game whatever,
for an opponent of less exalted rank
to play his or her best game without
infraction of the I rule that, not even
by accident, should the royal player
be defeated. Golf, tennis and such
games lost interest with those who
were obliged to play under these con
ditions, and it was only natural that
queens* and princesses regarded the
ballroom as the sole place where they
might indulge in exercise on an equal
footing with the partner instead of an
opponent. Queen Wllhelmina of Hol
land prefers the waltz. Queen Alex
andra, although over sixty, still waltzes
with as much pleasure as In the days
of her youth. Her sister, the Empress
Marie of Russia, despite her widowhood
and her many grandchildren, is still
an indefatigable waltzer. as is also
Queen Charlotte of "Wurttemberg. So
Important, indeed, is the matter of
dancing to crowned ladies that many
foreign governments make a point of
selecting for certain missions envoys
noted for their skill as waltzers.
.Throughout the reign of Queen Mar
gherita of Italy the British Foreign
Office took care to be represented at the
Italian court by the best dancer availa
ble, the late Lord Vivian; his successor,
Sir Francis Ford, and after him the
late Lord Dufferin, having been as
much noted for their dancing as for
their diolomatlc skill. Germany, too,
followed the example of Great Brit
ain, and was for years represented at
Rome by Count Solms, who was in
variably selected by Queen Margherita
to open the ball with her at any. enter
tainment where she happened to be
present.â Illustrated Sporting News.

there to ask where Rae lived.* I sim

to where a crowd stood around the
gate of a humble cottage which has
already become famous throughout
England as the Scottish Lourdes. Some
of the pilgrims limped painfully on
crutches. Others wore clump-soled
boots and irons. Gray-headed men and
women and little children in arms were
among them. While I stood there, tak

tears of gladness trickling down her
cheeks, came out of the bouse, and in
response to eager inquiries related her

The Tuileries' sparrows have implicit
confidence in Pere Pol. They perch on
his hands, his head and his shoulders
and accept bread from his fingers or
his lips indifferently. He has given
names to his favorites â Madeleine,
Belle Etoile. Marguerite, Boblnet, Joli

which they recognize and respond to
with exemplary promptness. At a
word from him, "Choco," or "Rivoli,"
or "Jeannette," or "Qui-Veut-l'Argent"

order given, salutes him with a dainty

keenly sensitive to both the praise and
the blame of their devoted friend and

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
Â£ HENRIETTA STREET, COYENT
GARDEN. LONDON. June 25.âMusic
lovers here had their anticipations
aroused by the reports from Monte
Carlo as to the merits of Saint-Saens'
new opera, "Helene," which was given
In the Riviera for the first time last
February, and its production at Covent
Garden was waited for with uncommon
interest. First night opinions pro
nounced the new work, which is in one
act, worthy to rank with its author's
r>cst efforts, and it may be said with
out exaggeration that nothing more
operatically dexterous or tunefully re
f.ned has been heard at the Royal
Opera-house in many years than this
new piece by the author of "Samson
â¢t Delilah." The scoring, beautifully
balanced, is an impressive feature of
"â¢Helene." and particularly satisfactory
to the modern ear is the low-toned,
ecnorous bass, which lends dignity to
the effect of the music
Seldom, at least in London, has an
opera been staged more beautifully.
The fecne is, of course, Troy, and this
has given the opportunity for a series of
stage pictures which are a delight to
remember. The whole thing is the story
of the flight of Helen and Paris turned
into a love allegory and purposed to
chow the supreme royalty of love over
all the other passions of man. Melba,
â¢who sang the title role, already had
done so at Monte Carlo, but since that
time the composer has made many
changes in his score, so that the prima

ly at . the annual competition at the
headquarters of the Central Shoeblack
Society, in Great Saffron Hall, the
honor was won by C. Smith, who for a
year will have the right to wear a gold

rapidity with which the transformation
from dirty to clean was effected was
marvelous. Lord Kinnaird, who was

"Several months ago I happened
across a pamphlet published by the
government of ay Southern State in
which were some 'interesting statistics
regarding the complexion of the inmates
of the State insane asylum." Hobart
Langdon said. "Only 3 per cent of
the total had light hair and only 2 per
cent blue eyes.
â¢ "It struck me as a rather curious
fact that dark-haired and dark-eyed
people should so largely predominate
among the insane, but the matter of
latitude might play some part in this".
I thought; for naturally there -were
more dark than light-haired people
in "that section. Just as a matter of
curiosity, however, I thought I would
write to asylum authorities in. certain
other parts of the country to see what
the ratio of light-haired inmates was
to those who were dark, and expected
to find the percentage Increase in com
munities where . the total of light
haired was larger, but in this I was
mistaken; so I. am led to infer from
the statistics I gathered that there is a
greater possibility of insanity among
dark-haired than among light-haired
people.* ;: V
"My figures were obtained from
sixty-eight asylums, located in nearly
every State in the Union, and a few
in .Canada and England. The total
number of patients in these institu
tions was 16,512, of whom 70S had
light hair and only 66 red or auburn
locks. In other words, 96 per cent of
the inmates were brunettes, with either
black or brown hair, the latter in
varying shades. In one asylum in New
England there was not a single in
mate that was "not a brunette. Of
course, I do not know how to account
for this, for I am not a specialist In
such matters, and only secured the
statistics out of pure 'curiosity, but it
certainly looks as though blondes were
less liable to insanity than those with
darker hair or eyes.
"Another peculiar feature about the
facts I obtained, however, was that
the percentage of those regarded as
incurably insane was much greater
among the blondes than among the
brunettes. The totals show that among
the dark-haired inmates only 53 per
cent were marked hopelessly, Insane,
while among the blondes 81' per cent
were put in this category, and that
only three among the red-haired pa
tients escaped the same classifica
tion." â St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
Complexion and Insanity.^
Provisions. -Â»'l;ich have been more active and firm at
Western packing centers during the past two or three
weeks, are row showing less activity and the paciers
have apparently ceased to support the market. The
disposition now is to sell. Speculation on the Chi
cago Board of.Tr.-.de has been somewhat livelier in all
lines of produce, as the wet weather throughout the
West has unsettled the markets and imparted a feverish
tone to a previously tame and uninteresting situation.
The statistics are now running better. The railway
earnings for June as far as received show gains of from
3 to 4 per cent over the corresponding month last year.
Collections at the end of the fiscal year closing June 30
were better than anticipated. The reduction in the out
put of many products has led to a corresponding reduc
tion in stocks of general merchandise, and the jobbers
and retailers are making better reports in consequence.
The bank clearings keep about where they have been
for some weeks past, the aggregate weekly clearings
averaging about $1,800,000,000, while the loss from last
year ranges from 5 to 20 per cent. The decrease last
week was 5.6 per cent, with the largest cities about,
equally divided between losses and gains as compared,
with 1903. The failures for the week were 206, against
104 last year, and included none worth talking about.
The national market for securities, such as railway
and industrial shares, has apparently emerged from its
stagnant and despondent state, which may be character
ized as a prolonged fit of the blues, and is now buoyant,
with a tendency toward a higher plane of quotations.
There are now signs that the public, which so long re
fused to touch stocks even with a long and safe pair of
tongs, are now nibbling at the market again, though
nothing is expected in this line until the midsummer
holidays are over, some weeks hence. â¢
The situation, yi Wall street is clearly expressed by a
leading bond house as follows: "The present activity
in the b6nd market, which has been apparent to all
since the.city of "New York succeeded in floating its big
May loan, ought to continue well into July. Conditions
are very much different this summer than they were last.
A year ago there # was an utter lack of confidence in the
financial situation and investors were afraid to buy any
thing. Confidence is now returning. Investors have had
time to separate the wheat from the chaff, and they are
re-entering the investment market with caution but with
courage.^ There is a general feeling that the crops can
not turn out, very badly, that we have seen the worst of
the business depression and that the election of Mr.
Roosevelt is a certainty. Investors who . earlier in the
year believed that they could buy bonds during the sum
mer at lower prices are now coming, into the bond mar
ket because they believe that we are to have a steady
improvement in prices.^
Our local coast situation remains unchanged. There
is no depression here, nor has there been any. It looked
for a time as. if the wave of recession slowly advancing
westward across the continent would soon. reach us, but
it has not and may never. Traders quieter than last year
at this time and margins of profit are probably narrower,
but considering their abnormal width, of. the past five or
six years what pruning they have received thus far in
1004 will not seriously injure any interest. Ships and
lumber are the quietest lines on the coast at present, al
most, all others being fairly active and in good condition.
Crop prospects continue excellent.
THE commercial and financial elements of the coun
try are now in the height of what is usually termed
the midsummer lull, and at this season nobody ex
pects any activity. Even- in the liveliest times business
is always slack during July and August and part of Sep
tember. Yet from all sections cheering reports are re
ceived and none report trade actually dull. The spirit
of pessimism which so generally prevailed during the
spring has almost wholly disappeared, and all markets
reflect the tone of confidence which became perceptible
about a month ago and /which has been gradually in
creasing ever since.
This confidence is based upon three factors: 1 First,
the general abundance of money both in this country
and in Europe; second, the generally excellent condition
of the three or four important crops, and third, the con
viction that the coming elections will not result in any
violent disturbance of financial and commercial condi
tions. It is distinctly seen that the country is on a sound
business basis and that there is nothing in sight to cause
any apprehension, as to the future.
As far as the important industries of the country are
concerned the most cheerful reports are coming in. True,
excessive rains throughout the West, Southwest and
Northwest have materially reduced previous estimates
of the yield, particularly in Kansas and the Red River.
Valk-3', but in spite of this the crop will be ample to
satisfy the requirements of the country. There will be
less for export, but the export of wheat is not the over
shadowing factor that it was some years ago, for as the
country's population increases and its wants become
more diversified, we are heeding more wheat at home
and care less for an exportable surplus. Still, we shall
probably have a respectabie quantity for export in any
event. The cotton crop bids fair tc be very large, with
the chances for good prices excellent. Cool weather
has been rather asjainst the corn crop of late, but an
ample yield of this cereal is almost assured.
As for wool, it is remarkably active. Boston reported
last week th?t the demand was livelier than for a year or
more, the American Woolen Company alone taking some
8,000,000 or 10.000.000 pounds of the raw material, while
the demand in the Northwest of late has been unprece
dented. In Wyoming and Montana Eastern buyers have
been .^couring the country for fleece, and such has been
their eagerness f>>r supplies that they have bought the
clip on the sheep's back. According to a reliable au
thority there some .20.000,000 pounds have thus far been
secured and about half of it brought 17c per .pound. It
ha? been a Scramble for wool. Buyers have not waited
for ihc usual public sales, but have dispatched mounted
mm Jo every nook and corner in quest of fleece, and
prices have advanced from ic to 3c per pound. Not for
some years have current prices been equaled. How this
boom in wool- will be received by the manufacturers and
what effect it will have on the manufactured product
later on remain to be seen, but one thing is certain â thus
far 1 he grower ha:Â» made a lot of money.
The lumber trade continues quiet and iii some sections
H d^pres<ed, with stocks burdensome and the mills de
i creasing; the Prices for iron and steel products
I are slightly lower, with all markets reported quiet.
1 This industry, which maintained such a fever heat for
rive or six ; c-r< that its soil produced the steel trust.
is now well down toward the tail end of the industrial
I column. The hide market has been firm of late, with
: fair activiÂ»>'v'Ci>orted.
"Gum! It's a' richt," he exclaimed,
"an' I'll be able to play in the next
njatch."
So things went on for the couple of
hours that I remained in the room.
Two little mites, swathed almost from
head to foot with bandages and sur
gical appliances were brought in by
their mother. She said the doctors had
told her they were suffering from hip
and spinal diseases, and held out small
hope of cure. When the Jiparted with
them, radiantly happy, the surgical ap
pliances had r.ll been discarded. Sev
eral other cures were wrought on the
spot. In nearly every instance Rae was
able to afford some relief. W'.ien he
could accomplish nothin he would ac
cept no fee. In other cases his charge
was to all the sameâ JÂ»2 50., But when
patients were obviously too poor to pay
it he bestowed just as mu.h care on
them for nothing. So great have been
the demands on his skill that the rail
way has run special excursion trains
to accommodate those who sought re
lief from him. In a single day he has
treated as many as 200. The train by
which I returned to Glasgow was filled
with people who were loudly proclaim
ing their admiration of him. One
Scotchman, after pitching the crutches
that he no longer needed out of the
window, declared his conviction that
William Rae was a greater man than
"Robbie"' Burns.
An old man next entered the room.
One leg was fairly straight, but the
other bont inward, so that he rolled
rather than walked. He hud been that
way for ""nigh on fifty years." he said.
The ex-miner passed hiÂ« hand care
fully over the leg that was all awry,
only to confirm the judgment he had
indicated to me I a significant glance
when the man entered the room that
his case was a hopeless one.
"Ye've bin ower. king, mon," he said,
returning to his chair. "Ye should
ha' haed this seen to when ye were
a bairn." The disappointed sufferer
slowly nulled on his socks and boots
and then as slowly put his hand in
his pocket.
"Na, na," said Rae, with a wave of
his hand, "ye can poot that back an'
gang awa' hame, my mon."
A youth of about sixteen, whose'ap
pearance plainly proclaimed curvature
of the spine, was the next patient.
Â¦ "Look at that, noo," exclaimed Rae
angrily, after the lad had pulled up
his shirt and exposed his back. "He
wouldna have a humpit back if his
fouks had brought him in to me when
he was a bairn. Xo man in the world
need ha' a humpit back if it's taken
in hand early enoo'."
He made the boy lie breast to breast
with himself and began handling the
spine, apparently with the object of
pressing it into place. This process he
continued for quite five minutes. When
at length the lad stood up he declared
that he felt much better, and, encour
aged, presented a thumb that had been
damaged by a ball in a game of cricket.
Rae felt it, pulled it, there was a click
and the boy's face lighted up as he
bent it to and fro. ;. -" : Â¦"/.--Â¦
"Xa, na," he answered, shaking his
bead, "not in every case. Those aw can
du .nothin for aw leave alane, but
roaist time? something can be done if
they're na too old."
Rae was born at Larkhall, then a
sparsely populated village some fifteen
miles from Glasgow, ana when a lad
began to earn his living by working in
a colliery. He rose to be pit-head fore
man at Larkhall, but before he was out
of his teens, yielding, as he says to
"something that told me aw had it in
me." he began tq practice bone-setting,
giving his services gratuitously at first, !
but as experience rendered him more !
expert so numerous became his patients !
that he found he would either have to
relinquish his work at the colliery or
abandon the practice of bloodless sur
gery. He decided to stick to the latter
and in a rough way, by means of such
books as he could get hold of, he
studied anatomy, but in the school of
experience he has gained nearly all his
training. For doctors generally he has
a great contempt, which .is not un
natural, seeing how many come to him
for relief, and often obtain it, too,
whom doctors have failed to benefit
and pronounced incurable.
"Doctors'." he exclaimed scornfully,
"what du they knaw aboot these
things? Maist of the puir people that
ccme to me have had doctors enoo
fooling with 'em an' na guid have they
dcr.e 'em. They Juist tak their money
an' label their trouble with wrong
names an' maybe, after a lot of experi
menting, tell 'em they can't be cured.
I've had lots o* such cases that juist
needed some bones being set straight to
niak" all richt. There's doctors for ye!"
When he had finished his pipe he
said. "Aw must besrin wark again,
noo; there's lots waiting for me," but
he acceded to my request to be al
lowed to remain and see how he op
erated. The first case was a little chap
! with a six-inch pattern fixed on to one
boot. His mother brought him in and
told the old story that the "doctor"
must have heard hundreds of times
before. He hardly seemed to listen to
it. though his face lightened up, for
the case was a good one.
"I was saying just noo," he observed
to me after having carefully examined

THE dogged tenacity shown by the Japanese on
land and sea and the surprise given by them to
the world in encompassing for the first time the
defeat of European troops by an Asiatic army makes in
teresting any information as to the contributing causes
thereof.
No factor bears more directly upon success or defeat
in battle than the quality of patriotism within the breast
of the common soldier. As it is upon him the^brunt of
the battle falls, anything tending to stimulate or detract
from his notriotism is of, high importance. At the out
break of the Russo-Japanese war reports were circulated
of the^great enthusiasm with which the cry to arms was
hailed from end to end of the Czar's "domain. It seems
now that the light which is beginning to sift through
the despotic envelope surrounding that country will show
that the conditions are hardly as tticy were described in
the beginning and that the Russian autocracy is whist
ling to keep its courage up. . . _
The limelight which was thrown on Finland by the
assassination of Governor General Bobrikoff has brought
into prominence the desperate efforts made by the little
father in attempting to force his military policy upon
that country. It has been apparent that the heavy penal
ties imposed by Bobrikoff upon those not complying with
the summons to military duty has had little effect." In
fact, in many places the summons has been entirely
ignored, not a single recruit appearing, while in other
localities only those presented themselves who were cer
tain to be rejected on account of bodily ailments.
The economic, depression and political discontent within
Russia are undoubtedly accentuated by the war and from
late reports the condition of things is not likely to be
bettered. A number of large firms in Moscow have be
come insolvent and business in Poland and Siberia is
practically at a standstill. Such cinformation has not
acted as a stimulus upon the Russian soldier, and per
sistent .reports of many desertions from the Russian
army come from widely -scattered points. Besides, that,
the socialistic propaganda has greatly interfered with
the mobilization of troops in the manufacturing districts.
A correspondent writing from the seat of war to a
Russian paper published in Geneva declares there is little
truth in the reports of the high military spirit and patriot
ism felt by the Russian soldiery, but that on the con
trary he has never heard an expression of enthusiasm
or even of, satisfaction from them. "He says, the regulars
go to the war resignedly because they are obliged^to go
wherever they are driven s and that the reserves all look
sad and erief-stricken, as ! nearly every one of them is
leaving behind a wife and three or four children without
any means of support. They do, not approve the war
and believe it is one of military conquest.
In speaking of the condition of the men the. writer
says the soldiers are aware that while they get perhaps
hardly one-tenth of what is appropriated for them, their
superiors are eating and drinking of the best at their
expense. The mode of transporting the soldiers to the
front is described as being enough to kill the most ardent
enthusiasm had there been any and that while the Red
Cross is appealing to the public for warm -clothing, the
reserves have to sell for a trifle or throw away their
civiliÂ«-yi overcoats, which have in many cases done duty
for a whole family, because the Government makes no
provision for returning them free to their homes.
These reports may account in some measure for the
gradual givinpr way of Russia's troops, who without
heart are fighting with a valor born of desperation, and
j may mr.ke patent the fact that the existing conditions are
not calculated to strengthen the moral authority of that
Government in the minds of the men who are struggling
to the death in her defense.

A daring burglary that has been
engaging the attention of the detec
tives occurred early Friday morning
at the Manhattan Hotel bar, 1706
Market street. The thieves, who were
undoubtedly familiar with the interior
arrangement of the saloon and the
custom of leaving considerable cash in
the place, obtained $65 as a result of
their operations.
The saloon adjoins the office of the
Manhattan Hotel. It . was closed at
two o'clock Friday morning by J. La
Verche, the bartender. About an hour
later Peter Mosher, the night clerk in
the hotel, heard a noise in the bar
and, under the impression that the
bartender had returned, went to the
door and called him by name. Re
ceiving no response, he came to the
conclusion that burglars were at work
and went in, search of an officer. Sev
eral minutes elapsed before he re
turned with a patrolman, but the
thieves had made their escape.
An examination of the premises
showed that the crooks had effected
an entrance by cutting away a por
tion of a glass door on Fell street and
slipping the. bolt. Nothing? was dis
turbed in the place except the coin,
which had been hid behind some bot
tles on the back bar. In view of the
fact of the proximity of the hotel of
fice and the all-night traffic on Mar
ket street the burglars showed great
boldness In their work. The police
have discovered no clew to the rob
bers.

from the wound on his neck and when
questioned he said that Chanez had
cut him with a razor. Chanez admitted
doing the cutting, but said that he did
It in self-defense, as Brown had made
two cuts at him with a razor which he
received on his coat and he showed two
cuts on that garment to confirm his

WEBSTER CITY. Iowa, July 10.â
Webster City's penchant for municipal
ownership is to take new form â that
of a city-owned daily newspaper. This
departure in municipal enterprise
probably has not a counterpart in the
United States. The paper is to be
known as the Daily Graphic-Herald
and will be issued from the office of
the present Weekly Graphic-Herald,
the only Democratic paper in Hamil
ton County.
Webster City began her career as a
municipal ownership city many years
ago. She first-acquired possession of
her waterworks. Next came an elec
tric light and power plant. Then came
the city heating plant and now this
latest venture.

MUNICIPAL. OWNERSHIP
PLAN* TAKES NEW FORM
The transport Thomas, from Manila,
will be due here' late Wednesday night.
She brings 327 cavalry, 327 casuals, 40
general prisoners, 4i sick and 1 insane.
At the Presidio corrals are 210 mag
nificent specimens of thoroughbred and
high-class stallions, mares, geldings
and mules. The geldings and mules
will be sent to the army post in Hono
lulu, but the stallions and mares will
go out to the insular service in the
Philippines. There they will be inter
bred with the small native horses of
those islands with a view to raising
the standard of the stock in the
islands.
These animals have come from all
parts of th6 country and are the best
the Government officials could pur
chase. They have been bought in the
finest marts of New York. Boston.
Kentucky, Texas and Mexico. Presl^
dent Roosevelt has taken a personal
interest In the move that resulted In
the shipment, and it was at his sug
gestion that the Government decided to
send the animals out. A further ship
ment is expected from the East daily.
The lot will go out in the transport
Dix, which Major C. A. Devol is busily
engaged in getting ready for their ac
commodation. He expects she will sail
about August 1.
The transport Buford, which arrived
at Skagway on July 7, sailed from that
port for Valdez Bay last night. She
carried away from here the Third In
fantry, which is to be stationed at dif
ferent Alaskan ports.
The transport Sherman, which sailed
from this port for Manila on July 1,
arrived 8t. Honolulu Saturday night,
bring twenty-four hours overdue. She
has on board a large number of army
officials, a lot of casuals and a small
body of recruits.
Private aflvices received here yester
day state that General Adna R. Chaffee
will arrive in San Francisco early in
August. Borne time ago, when General
Chaffee announced his intention of
coming: westward to make a tour of
inspection, his itinerary only embraced
the northern departments, this depart
ment being omitted. Since that time,
however, he has evidently changed his
mind, as he is coming to San Fran
cisco. He will be accompanied by Mrs.
Chaffee. Whether or not the visit here
will be in the form of a tour of in
spection or simply a visit of a personal
nature has not been announced. '
The following order has been issued
by General MacArthur regarding the
United States troops to take part in

composed of Companies A, C, D and K, Thir
teenth Infantry; Lieutenant Colonel William L.
Pltrher- and the Provisional Battalion, com
posed of Companies B. F, I and M. Twenty
eighth Infantry; the Fifteenth Infantry (entire
regiment), and the Company of Instruction,
Hospital Corps No. 2, are designated to take
part in the field exercises to be held at the
camp at Rancho del Encinal, San Luis Obispu
County, California, and will proceed by rail, in
time to be in camp on the night of August 8,
l'.<04. Â»
Company C, Signal Corps, now absent at
tending- the field exercises In the Department of
the Columbia, will, upon its return to this de
partment, proceed as soon as possible to the
camp at Rancho del Encinal to take part In the
field exercises at that place.
The quartermaster's department will furnish
the necessary 1 transportation, the subsistence
department suitable travel rations, with funds
for the purchase of liquid coffee, and the medi
cal department will provide medical attendance
and supplies.
Mannix had been before the Citizens'
Committee several times during the
past week and his resignation demand
ed. This he refused to give and the
County Commissioners were requested
to remove him. They replied that they
were advised by counsel that they had
no authority to remove Mannix and de
clined to meet the request of the com
mittee. Mannix feared for his safety
and a guard of military was placed at
his residence. Late last night he de
cided to leave the district and General
Bell and a detail of soldiers accompa
nied him. Mannix said he was not being
deported. Discussing the case, Gen
eral Bell Is credited with saying:
"There is no telling what would hap
pen if Mannix remained in the district.
He left because he thought it would
be facing death to remain about Crip
ple Creek with conditions as they are
to-day. Many of these men are al
most mad and probably would be
guilty of foolish acts Â«r the occasion
came up. They are not sane in their
judgment and their prejudices carry
them to extremes. It seems to be now
a case of settling up old grudges and
you can't tell what will happen. We
are doing the best we can with soldiers
who sometimes work day and night."

The latter hope is voiced by most erf
us who are interested in the preserva
tion of historic buildings, relics, and
the traditions that cling about them.
But there seems to be a divergence
of opinion about the Camino Real
among some excellent people, who are
likewise pood Californians, and who
labor under the belief that a terrible
burden of debt is about to be unloaded
upon a guileless publicâ some millions
of dollars with which to hunt far and
identify the "real truly" trail of the
honored padres, which, by the way,
cannot possibly be found nor identi
fied, since there were dozens and dozens
of trails and carreta roads used in
the pastoral days, and then a whole
new system of reads builded upon this
visionary highway. Now, In the
minds of the most practical leaders of
this movementâ who at the same time
entertain a large need of sentiment for
it â the Camino Real exists to-day. It
exists in the prosaic guise of county
roads, winding from San Diega Mis
sion to San Juan Capistrano, to San
Luis Rey, to San Fernando, and on
northward to the Mission de Ios Do
lores in our own city. What if the
exigencies of time and conditions com
pelled a swerving of the road to the
east or west, a lowering or a raising
of the grade? What If the building of
a fence threw the old beaten road
way ten or twenty or a hundred feet
out of the best remembered course?
What of It, bo long as a good road
lies in the immediate neighborhood of
the paths trodden by the sandaled
monks in the ' long ago? Shall we
abandon these good roadways and
spend years in quibbling over routes,
of which no living man hath knowl
edge or shall we unite to improve the
roads we already have â the county
roads that to-day link Mission with
Mission? While the sentimentalistsâ
and heaven bless him who hath senti
mentâwill balk at the alleged "fak
ing" and "misrepresentation" of this
project, it must be conceded to be the
only sensible and tenable proposition.

"I suffered from continuous nervous
twitching, insomnia, restless, miserable
nights, nerves all gone. Craving for
coffee was intense, but It put me lower
and lower in health. Something must
be done, eo I tried leaving: off the cof-
fee and using PoBtum Food Coffee. The
first trial wife and I were both disgust-
ed for we were careless in brewing it,
but we went carefully into the subject
of preparing Postum and found we had
only allowed It to brew about five min-
utes, and that won't make good Pos-
tum. So nexf time it was boiled full
fifteen minutes after boiling: began,
then served with good cream and it
was toothsome and delicious. That
marked the beginning of my return to
health. Now I sleep well, the old
twitching has disappeared, and in
ehort I am well again. My good wife
has also been much benefited by leav-
ing off coJTee and using Postum Food
("cfTee. \\> have abandoned the old
coffee for all time." Xatr.e given by
Postum Co.. Battle Creek, Mich.
There's a reason why so many intel-
ligent people and physicians drink
FÂ«>Â«tum in place of ordinary cofft*e.
Look In each pkg. for the famous lit-
tle book, "The Road to Wellville."
If coffee has you where your nerves
demand it each morning you have a
wrÂ»ck ah<?ad sure.
Think back for a year and notice how
the 1 sick spells grow on you Instead of
pr-itlrig less.
You are rannjns into nervous pros-
tration or some fixed disease absolute-
ly certain, and when it suddenly take3
full possession you will find nothing;
absolutely nothing; in drujjs that will
heal you. Xature demands penalty for
the daily hurt to the nerve centers by
coffee, and you must pay the full price.
A physician of Cornwall, Ont., says
of himself: "For years coffee was to
me what rum is to the toper, but I kept
getting worse and worse in health.

A friend that you have to buy won't
be worth what you pay for him, no
matter what that may be.â Prentice.
This story is. being told of a certain
New York politician: He had suc
ceeded in securing for a friend of his
a place as tax assessor, at the cost of
considerable exertion. Not long after
the friend had begun work in his new
place the v politician was surprised and
grieved' to see that he was taxed un
der . "personal ' property" $24 as tne
possessor of one goat. He called on
his friend the assessor for an expla
nation, accusing him of ingratitude
and forgetfulness of favors received.
"But I /could do no less than obey
.tne specific ' details of the law," pro
tested his friend; - "lookâ here's what
it says," and he read from, his papers:
"For all property bounding or abut
ting on the highway, $12 per front
foot."â Harper's Weekly.

fering, perhaps, as to details of cus
toms, ideas, standards and observ
ances, but nevertheless the same In all
essential thingsâ whether we find them
in England, Germany, France, Italy or
Spain. The suggestion we wish to
make Is that wealthy Americans will
be wise to inquire ' Into the personal
character and repute of foreign suitors
much more anxiously* than Into the no
biliary titles they may parade. And
this relates especially to France, where
one may assume any titleâ from
Comte to Princeâ which 'happens to
suit his fancy, without provoking the
smallest interference by the Govern
ment.âWashington Past. /

"If there were any bad news," she
said, "it would have come by telegraph.
It must be that something has hap
pened to Mr. Hlghmore's rich cncle."â
Chicago Tribune.
The present railway sleeping car i3
ideally bad from a hygienic point of
view. The bedding material is tigthly
closed up during the day, from the
purifying effects of sunlight and fresh
air, and is of such a nature as to read-l
ily catch and retain, Infection. The up
holstery and decorations of the car are
perfect dust and germ collectors, and
the toilet appliances are of such a na
ture that a man with a "walking" ty
phoid fever might readily infect a num
ber of communities along the railway
line. The ordinary day coach, in its
decorations and lavatory, is open to
the same condemnation. Although at
tention has been repeatedly called to
these dangers by physicians, little has
yet been done to remedy them, or even
to regularly disinfect the cars. The
latter process has been used to some
extent on several roads, but there is
apparently no attempt to supersede
the extremely dangerous open hopper.â

New Sleeping Cars.
But he was drawn up in good time,
the bag was repaired and the leak
stopped.â London Sketch.
Then the captain stepped into the bag
and bv means of tackle he was drawn
under water, so* that he could see the
leak. The other end of the bag being
open and above water he had plenty of
air, and also an opportunity of commu
nicating with his men.
Two sleeves had been made and were
tightly bound at his wrists, so that he
could. work freely.
In" this way, looking at the leak
through the window in the bag, he
worked steadily while the ship was
hove to. The vessel rolled in a heavy
swell, and sometimes Captain Mattson
found himself from seven to ten! feet
below the waves.
At one time it seemed that the work
would cost the captain his life, as the
chafing of his feet against the vessel's
side wore a hole . in the bag, and the
water entered and covered him. .- v^V 'Â¦':
Captain Mattson found that the leak
was getting worse, and he had a wind
mill rigged up to help the men. Even
this was found insufficient, bo he had
recourse to his ingenuity.
He constructed a great waterproof
canvas bag, sixteen feet^long, six feet
in circumference and two feet in diam
eter. This he keDt extended by means
of hoops. A 'window of glass was let
into the side five feet from the bottom.
All hands were kept at 'the pumps
day and night without intermission. As
the gale abated the vessel drove before
it into calmer seas.
Bound from Norway to Cape Town,
the Flora experienced terrific weather
in the bay of Biscay and was compelled
to lie for si* days. In ; the buffeting
she received she sprang a leak,
which let in the water at the rate of
six inches an hour.
Captain Iver Mattson of the Norwe
gian bark Flora, who has just brought
his vessel to South Africa, has invented
a novel and ingenious method of stop
ping a leak at sea, writes our Cape
Town correspondent.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
The unfotunate' young man was im
mediately conveyed to the Park Emer
gency Hospital, and James and Harry
Delcasso, members of the Sexton par
ty, were later placed under arrest
pending an investigation of the affair.
A young man named Van Issendorf,
living at Page and Lyon streets, was
badly beaten and struck on the head
by a rock.
According to a report made to Po
lice Sergeant Gamble by witnesses.
Van Issendorf, after being beaten,
drew a revolver and fired five shots
into the crowd. One of the bullets
struck Sexton in the abdomen and he
sank to the ground with what is be
lieved to be a mortal wound. Van
Issendorf was arrested and admitted
tiring several shots.
R. Pe,rcy Sexton, a clerk in the store
department of the Southern Pacific
Company, was shot and probably fat
ally wounded, shortly after midnight,
at Page and Lyon streets, during a
fiee-for-all fight In which seven or
eight young men were engaged.
In company with a number of
friends, Sexton had been at the ocean
beach during the evening and returned
quite late. While coming in on the
car words passed between another
party of young men and the friends of
Sexton. Ail had been drinking. When
the terminus of the road was reached
the words led to blows and an incipi
ent riot followed.

The Gutta Percha Supply.
The last source of gutta percha de
veloped is thatjjn th* Philippine Isl
ands, but there the regions which pro
duce this material for the market are
confined to the Islands of Mindanao and
Tawi-Tawi. The method of harvesting
used at present by the natives consists
In cutting down the large trees, ringing
the trunk, lopping off the larger
branches and then catching the milk as
it flows out. This is very wasteful, as
but a small part of the milk Is secured.
Fortunately, however, this process pays
only with large trees, so that the small
er ones are not destroyed. This method
of harvesting has been prohibited and
rules provided for tapping the trees,
but these have never been enforced. At
the present time the gutta percha trees
have disappeared from the coast re
gions and are along the large rivers.
The various governments with trop
ical possessions in the East are study
ing the gutta percha and rubber situ
ation, with a view of determining
proper methods of propagation and har
vesting.âElectrical Review.

"Besides, this man has agreed to go
where his family now resides, Virginia,
and not again reside in Kentucky. His
wife has died since he has been con
fined and left to him two little children
that need his care and attention. Be
lieving this man, who is yet a young
man, if spared fr6m the ravages of
Bright's disease, may yet make a use
ful citizen, I do my part toward re
deeming him, pardon him of the crime
for which he stands convicted and all
charges growing out of said feud and
the killing of Altfalr McCoy. Tolbert
McCoy, Farmer McCoy. Randolph Mc-
Coy Jr. and Coleman McCoy."
The McCoys joined In the petition
asking for the pardon of their old foe.
They claimed, with his kinsmen, that
he was not a member of, the Hatfield
party in the midnight August raid in
188S, in â¢ which many McCoys â men.
women and children â were shot to
death and others cruelly wounded.
Both said he was miles away, sick in
bed. On the petition for a pardon the
Acting Governor wrote the following:
"The McCoy and Hatfleld people,
parties to this feud, after twenty-six
years, desire peace. Both sides of the
old feud are anxious to cross out all
old scores and settle their differences,
and every law abiding man should be
only too glad to render whatever as
sistance he can to bring these results
about.
FRANKFORT, Ky., June 10.â Giving
as one of the reasons that the Hatnelds
and the McCoys, the famous Kentucky
Â£nd West Virginia feudists. are now at
peace and anxious to forget old scores.
Acting Governor Thome last night
pardoned Johnson Hatfleld. one^ of the
survivors of the deadly mountaineer
vendetta. Â» Hatfleld had served four
years of a life sentence for the killing
of a McCoy. He was granted clemency
tor all his crimes.

The visit creates no little adverse edi
torial comment, its object being held
to be a mystery which, the Daily Mail
declares, is only explained by the anxi
ety of the German officers to see the
mobilizing of the British fleet, which is
now preparing for the maneuvers.
PLYMOUTH. England, July 11.â
Thousands of persons witnessed the ar
rival in Plymouth to-day of the most
powerful German fleet ever seen in
British waters. Eight battleships and
seven cruisers steamed into the naval
basin on a visit of courtesy amid deaf
ening salutes, and the British and Ger
man admirals exchanged visits. The
courtesies wjll be kept up until July 13.
when the Germans will depart.
Owing to a wish expressed to King
Edward, the Germans will receive no
formal public welcome, and the cere
monies will be confined to naval honors
and an Informal luncheon by the Mayor
of Plymouth.
LONDON, July 11.â The arrival of the
German squadron at Plymouth has cre
ated an excellent impression here. The
Daily Mail's naval expert, who is one
of the best specialists in his line in
England, says the squadron Is "incon
testabaly superior In fighting qualities
to the British home or channel fleet, as
now constituted."
The ship Celtic Monarch, another
overdue, 213 days out from London and
bound for Puget Sound, was apoken on
April 4. She was in latitude 54 24. de
grees south and longitude 47 14 degrees
west. This position places her In the
South Atlantic well to the eastward of
Patagonia.
Among the overdues are the ship
Wanderer, now out ISO days from
Antwerp, and the Routenburn, from
Newcastle, Australia, 206 days out, both
bound for this port. The French bark
General de Boisdeffre, .sister bark to the
Montebello and bound forÂ« San Fran
cisco, is out 160 days from Swansea,
but she probably found the same light
and head winds the Montebello did and
is delayed thereby. This also may ac
count- for the slow voyage of the
French ship Vauban, now 138 days from
Swansea,
In this age of steam, of electricity
and of bo many new methods of me
chanical force and propulsion the /utter
unreliability of sail power on a ship
becomes more apparent every day.
"As variable as the wind" is a saying
old and worn with constant use, but It
is true, however trite. The Montebello,
which slipped into port late Saturday
night, demonstrates this fact. She is a
big'salling ship and left Swansea, Eng
land, 182 days ago for San Francisco.
Her log reads light and head winds,
and she came into port about fifty days
behind time. So slow was she in her
coming that her owners put 15 per cent
reinsurance on her probable loss, and
if she had remained out of sight forty
eight hours longer the rate would haVe
been advanced to 20 per cent. As it is,
she has cost her owners a pretty sum
because the breezes would not blow
when and where she needed them.
On the other hand, the steamer Ha
waiian, which arrived yesterday morn
ing, left New York sixty-one days ago.
She came through the straits of Magel->
Ian, hardly .varying in her daily speed
as the propellers drove her ahead. The
Hawaiian is one of the large freighters
of this port, being 425 feet long, 52&.
feet beam and 28 feet in depth. She is
commanded by Captain C. W. Delano
and is of 3700 tons register.
Noerling, full of the notion that
some of the frequenters of his store
were paying too much attention to his
wife, j became insanely jealous. .The
family .lived in a tworstorv frame
dwelling in the rear of the store.
It was nearly midnight when he
reached home Saturday night and he
began abusing her. He flourished a re
volver In his wife's face and told her he
was going to kill her, the children and
himself and end his troubles.
Mrs. Noerling and the children at
tempted to make their escape past him
on the stoop, but Noerling intercepted
her and as she faced him he fired at
her. The bullet struck her just over
the right eye but she did not fall.
Noerling fired again, the bullet passing
through her right hand, and she fell
to the ground. Thinking that he
had killed his wife, Noerling fired two
shots at his children, and then barri
cading himself in his room, he sent a
bullet through his own brain.
NEW 'YORK, July 10.â Upon rally
ing at the hospital to-day after the
surgeons had dressed her wounds.
Mrs. Susan -Noerling, when informed
that William Noerling, her husband,
who had shot her twice and then
turned the revolver on himself at their
home in Brooklyn, was dead, with
brightened face smilingly, declared
that she was "glad of it." Noerling,
who was 35 years old, shot his "wife in
the presence of the.ir nve children
shortly after 2 o'clo'ck this morning
while in a jealous r5ge. Previously he
had beaten her with a wooden medi
cine chest, gashing her scalp. He
struck his son Peter, 13 years old, in
the reouth when he attempted to in
tercede in his mother's behalf.

The Queen of Holland is an en
thusiastic farmer. A dairy has been
established in connection with the royal
castle of Loo. and it Is run on quite
businesslike lines by its owner, large
quantities of butter and milk being
sold regularly from the dairy, which
Ik now self-supporting and profitable.
Another hobby of the young Queen is
photography, and, like Queen Alex
andra and other distinguished ama
teurs, she is quite an expert with the
camera. A pretty story is told of the
Queen's fondness for the accomplish
ment. Noticing a peasant woman on
one of her drives in picturesque cos
tume, holding a baby in her arms, she
asked permission to take a picture, to
the great delight of the woman, who
received a present after the snapshot
had been taken, while the baby got a
kiss from the Queen.â Westminster Ga

Of one singularly attractive and dec

touches all classes, from nobles to cool

They are used to tie up the gifts which

After the presentation of the gift the

W. B. Collier's model yacht Fannie,
after qualifying for the finals many
times, finally carried i off the pennant
yesterday in competition on Spreckels
Lake, Golden Gate Park. 7 The winning
boat is one of the fastest built this
year,; but has had poor racing luck.
Competition narrowed down to the
Fannie and Apache in the finals, and
the former proved her superiority by
winning three straight races. The
Apache, however, sailed the course in
3:20, the best time of the day. -
Collier's new racing rules were used
and seemed {o give general satisfac
tion. Under, them a boat failing to
finish first after three trials drops out.
The average time was not taken, as
heretofore. . As held yesterday/ the
element of luck does not cut as much
of a figure as formerly. Every boat
has at least thre'e chances. When the
race narrows down to two ; boats they
race until one boat beats the other
three times. By winning three straight
from the Apache the Faijnie proved
she was the best boat yesterday. Of
the nine races she won <nve and the
Apache four. No other boat won a race.

they beat Charles Foley and Charles
Dunlap. Both sets were close and in

to Whitney. Foley and Dunlap played

The tennis players took advantage
of the pleasant weather yesterday and
appeared in force on me courts. The
attraction at the California Club was
a practice match between Percy Mur
dock and Drummohd MacGavin. It
was their flrst meeting since the San
Francisco championship, when Mur
dock took MacGavin into camp. The
match was watched witn interest, as
these two players are the best in the
vicinity of San Francisco.
Neither player let himself out as he
would in a tournament, but both were
out to win. After losing the first set
Murdock pulled out the next two hand
"ily. In the first set Murdock started
off in the lead, winning the first five
games. At this Doint MacGavin set
tled down to hard play and by some
fast -volleying and smashing took seven
games straight and the set. The State
champion eased down after this and
Murdock annexed the last two sets
easily.
Murdock and MacGavin have decided
to Join forces and play as a team in
the coast doubles tournament. Grant
Smith will not be able to participate
in any more tournaments this year
and his place will be taxen by Mur
dock.

Men of the South Go to Pieces In the
Eighth Inning.
PORTLAND, July 1 10. â Ira Hastings
is the real thing in the box. Ira is the
youth Dugdale discovered with the
Hoquiam team. The Loo Loos saw
him in the box to-day, but they did
not discover him. He toyed with the
men from the. southland in a fashion
of a cat with a niouse. When the
dazed batsmen began to take courage
the brunette acquisition let out a few
more kinks and his contract was again
complete. Dolly Gray did brilliant
work, but weakened in the eighth
inning and was touched up smartly.
His support was good until Chase
fumbled in fielding Beck's slow hit
toward flrst. The score:

Statistics ot the Church.
According to Dr. Walter Laidlaw, an
authority on church statistics, there
are about 30,000,000 church members
out of 82,000,000 inhabitants of the
United States. Of these 30,000,000 the
Roman Catholics number more than
one-third. These have gained enor
mously in recent years by the heavy
Immigration from countries such as
Italy, Poland "and Austria-Hungary,
where the vast majority of the popula
tion is loyal to the church of Rome.
It is calculated that since 1830 the Cath
olics lnVthe United States have in
creased about 60 per cent, or over 4,000,
000. In the same fourteen years the
growth of the population cannot have
been more than 30 per cent, or at most
35 per cent. So it appears that the
Roman Catholics constitute about 15
per cent of the entire population of the
United States.
According to Dr. Laidlaw the Pro
testant church members have Increased
about 35 per cent since 1S90. thus gain
ing at least as fast as the gross popu
lation of the United States.â New York

In His Own Estimation.
"A hero is a man who does something
bold and desperate for his country'*
good, isn't he?" said Senator Sorghum.
"Tea," was the reply.
"Well, I don't see why nobody comes

where I could serve my country."â

TACOMA, July 10. â The game to-day
was the most exciting of the present
series. San Francisco would have been
shut out had not Umpire McDonald de
clared a balk in the fourth inning on
Overall, walking Anderson from third
home, as .otherwise he would never
have scored. Overall was a foot out
side the box and made a motion to
throw to first, tnis constituting what
McDonald called a balk. San Francisco
was on the bases every inning, but
could not get hits from the giant col
legian when hits meant runs. A two
bagger by Casey and McLaughlln's sin
gle in the second, and a two-bagger by
Overall and Sheehan's single in the
eighth scored Tacoma's runs. The

STANDING. OF THE CLUBS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The sloop Thelrna, sailed by S. S.
Marshall, won the annual race for the
Wallace trophy of the California Yacht
Club yesterday by the narrow margin
of seventeen seconds., a closer race
than that between the Corinthian and
the Challenger for the perpetual chal
lenge cup on Saturday. Robert Vin
cent's yawl Iola was second and C. E.
Clark's yawl Gypsie third. W. Rosen
feld's sloop Jessie E., sailed by J. T.
Carrier, did not finish.
The preparatory gun was fired at 12
noon and the starting gun at 12:10 p.
m. It was a flying start, the yachts
crossing the line in the following or
der: Gypsie, Iola, Jessie E. and Thel
ma. The course was across a line
drawn from the southerly pierhead of
the Oakland broad gauge mole to a
stake boat anchored 100 yards off, to
and around Presidio Shoal buoy, leav
ing Goat Island on the starboard
hand; thence back to the finish, across
the starting line, leaving Goat Island
on the port hand. The sloop Jessie E.
sailed well, but her skipper, not wish
ing to gybe her with watersail set,
g;iv(j up the race. The yawl Iola finish
ed first, the sloop Thelma second and
the yawl Gypsie third. As it was low
water at Fort Point at 2:15 p. m. the
race was sailed wholly on an ebb tide.
A moderate but not strong breeze
blew steadily and the water was
smooth. The race was under the
management of A. Vekander of the re
gatta committee of the California
Yacht Club. The yawl Iola was
srratchboat; but, though she finished
lirst, the race went to the sloop Thelma
on time allowance. The details are
shown in the table:

Runs at the fall of each wicket â One for 4,
The Alameda cricket team succeeded
in drawing the rnatch with the San
Francisco County eleven yesterday on
the grounds at Alameda. Going to the
wickets first, the San Francisco County
team scored 153 runs, the chief con
tributors being H. B. Richardson (59).
H. Roberts (25) and M. Eubanks (24).
Richardson's score included one 5 and
eight 4's. Harold Ward and W. G.
Fortmann were the most successful
bowlers, the former taking 4 wickets
for 36 runs and the latter 3 for 36. H.
Roberts kept up his wicket for nearly
three hours and proved a valuable help
to his side.
When eight of the Alameda wickets
were down for 101 runs and only twen
ty minutes of play remained, it became
evident that the San Francisco score
could not be beaten, , and the Alameda
batsmen played for a draw. Ward
went in to hit, but after one or two
narrow escapes, was caught, having
made only 7 runs. Fortmann hit free
ly, but was bowled when his score
stood at 14. All depended upon Ben
nlon, who, by taking all the bowling
and playing coutiously, kept his wicket
up. making 18 runs. Time was .called
when the Alameda team had scored 137
runs for nine wickets. The details fol

rounds by Pocatelli and Belle Free and,
fleet as they are, they could never
break him down. The trial lasted 2
minutes and 29 seconds and ruined
Pocatelli's prospects for the open
stake. He was withdrawn and the
Ion? end of the purse went to Hap
hazard by default.
The latter did not fare much better
than his -opponent, running 2 mlmites
and 7 seconds in the seml-Ilnal. â¢
Full Moon, the 1 to 3 choice, was
beaten in the third round by Royal
Friend by a fluke, the hare breaking

Jar, "if you make the least outcry I will

According to the .records of the
Morgue there were no bodies delivered
to the city, undertakers last week and
the records of the Almshouse show only
two and those were taken away from
the Institution on July 7. The officials
at the City and County Hospital could
not give any definite answer last night
regardinafthe number which had been
tuken . from there during the week. If
any. James Hagan Ms loud in his de
nunciation of his brother and Kelley
and insists that he will have them both
arrested this morning.
Dr. Ragan of the Board of Health
stated his attention had not been called
to the matter and he knew nothing of
an order -being issued to remove the
bodies and have them buried.
Kelley and' William Hagan have a
barn at the rear of the house occupied
by Mrs. Cassia, at 3620 Nineteenth
street, and outside of the barn the dead
wagon was standing last night, but
William Hagan had gone to San Ma
teo and his statement could not be
secured.
James D. Hagan says that to-day, he
will swear out warrants for the arrest
of his brother, William Hagan, and
John Kelley, for burying dead bodies
in ground belonging to James D. Hagan
and Joseph Hagan, his brother. Kelley
and William Hagan are the authorized
undertakers for the burial of the city's
dead. There is "a family feud over the
matter "and if James Hagan carries out
his threat there will .be some airing
of the undertaking business in the
courts. The whole matter is summed
up in the following statement from
Jcmes D. Hagan: .
Early in June the Board of Supervisors ad
vertised for bids for burylns the city poor.
The bids j were called for far ahead of the
usual time and no attention was paid to the
call. My brother William, who is a grave
digger by occupation, and John Kelley, the
man who was mixed up tn the charge of brib
ery against Ounther. pat in a bid for $o SO
for each body burled. They are not undertak
ers and. are not equipped for the work, but
the contract was awarded to them on the
statement that they had a cemetery In which
to bury the corpses. On Wednesday night
they took -three bodies to San Mateo and bur
led them, in the Sunset ground, which is
owned by my brother Joe and myself. Wil
liam telephoned to Joe and told him that
their permits had not been granted and he had
buried the bodies tn our lots, as he thought
it would be all right. Under the circum
stances Joe said it would be all right, but not
to do It asain.
Â¦ By Saturday afternoon eight bodies were
stored In an old barn, which William had
rented from some Italians S on Nineteenth
street, and the matter was complained ot by
the neighbors and the Board of Health ordered
them removed. . At midnight Kelley and Wil
liam Hagan took the bodies to San Mateo and
burled them in our lots, near where they had
buried the others. My brc'her Joe had for
bidden him to use our ground, hence I will
have them both arrested in the morning.

BAVARIAN MURDERED SOX OK HIS tSMPLOTUR \VD TRIUD TO KIT I
ENTIRE FAMILY. HIS VICTIM AND' INTENDED VJCTIMS ; ivn i LIAGRVM
SHOWING COURSE HE TOOK IN TRYING TO ESCAPE DIAGRAM
All who know Gerbersay that he is
frequently seized with' ugly moods.
Two months' ago he applied to War
rant Clerk Ward for the arrest of a
bartender at the Avalon saloon. On
being searched Geber was found to be
the owner of an ugly knife and a long
dirk. These were taken " from him at
the time and later he procured the
slungshot which was found in his
room. He denies that he owned, the
revolver with which he did the shoot
ing, asserting that he found it in the
Hartmann home. " The police believe
him to be an ex-convict. Â¦ '
"They would not feed m^," asserts
the prisoner. "Then old Hartmann
called me names and attacked me. Â¦ I
shot in self-defense."
Geber is held at the City Prison on a
murder charge. . . "
Clifford Anderson, a fourteen-year
old boy, who lives at 141" Hawthorne
street, heard the. first shots and rushed
into the front . yard ,of the Hartmann
place Just as Geber sent the bullet into
Charles' throat. The boy says that the
murderer tried to escape over a back
fence, but that his clothing caught.
Then he rushed into the street and
was run down by Policeman Tyrrill.
Geber is a Bavarian about 50 years
of age. For many years he has. been
a noticeable figure about * town. He
has a high philanthropic forehead,
restless brown eyes, a scraggy pointed
beard and long iron-gray hair -that
hangs over his shoulders like a mane.
He has practiced palmistry and phre
nology in the past and .has ridden
other hobbies, such as socialism, the
osophy and the nature :crazte. For' a
year he carried a banner along Market
street, for a ticket brokerage firm.
GEUKK HAS BAD RECORD.
Geber, with a vile . Imprecation,
straightened his arm and fired. With
a choking sob Charles Hartmann reeled
and fell dead on the threshold of his
home. The bullet pierced his throat,
killing him almost instantly.
The murderer ran up Third street,
still flourishing the pistol. As he
neared Howard street Policeman Tyr
rill called upon him to halt. Geber
only ran the faster'and turned into a
lodging-house at 153>i Third street.
Tyrrill followed closely upon his
heels and cornered him in a small
yard # in the rear of the lodging-house.
Here "a desperate struggle took place
between the brave policeman and the
murderer. Tvrrill clang to the revol
ver with one hand and managed to
draw his club with the other. Geber
had to be beaten into submission like
a wild animal. In the struggle for the
weapon the policeman's hands were
painfully lacerated.
The murdered youth was carried into
his home by his grief-stricken parents.
Medical assistance was summoned,
though Charles Hartmann was beyond
any help. His brother was taken to
the Central Emergency Hospital,
where his Injured arm was dressed.
BOY WITNESSES SLAYING.
SON DIES OX THRESHOLD,
Young George staggered back as he
felt the sting of the bullet and Geber
burst through the doorway. With a
corse the enraged man struck the old
woman brutally across the face, knock
ing her to the floor.
Like a Malay running amuck, Geber
rushed through the house into the front
yard, waving the smoking pistol in his
hand. Here he encountered Charles
Hartmann.
After diseussingr the matter with his
wife and family Hartmann Sr. walked
into the outhouse and called Geber.
Geber hurried downstairs, and stand
ing in a narrow landing fired point
blank at Hartmann. The old man fled
in terror and his son George rushed into
the place. The plucky young fellow
slammed a door in the murderer's face
and held it fast. Quickly Geber fired
two shots through the \ door, one of
which pierced young Hartmann's arm.
The other narrowly missed Mrs. Geber,
who stood behind her son, screaming in
terror.
it." Young Hartmann told his father
of this incident, and the old man deter
mined to dismiss Geber.

shouts of " laughter at the many good
points of the play. . Edythe Chapman

she 'played "that- role in a finished and
charming manner. Her magnificent
costumes caused a thrill of excitement
among' the" fair sex In attendance.

excellent " impersonation. '. ' . . .;
The fun-making of the "play mainly
developed upon Lillian Andrews as. the
flirtatious Widow. .Lady Chartris." . She
was ably assisted by Faye' Wallace as
the precocious Maud. This little -miss
is a. niece of the famous Lotta, and
has , much Â¦ of that famous come
dienne's; style -'and ability.' Frances
Slossoh was especially fetching in the
railroad scene, when she â¢ was trying
to get a sandwich to satisfy the rav
enous pangs of hunger. Donald Bowles.
J. W. Burton, Reginald Travers and
George Bloomquest. were equal to re
quirements of their respective roles.

"A Perfect Paradise." They introduce
a trained dog. "Zero," and- the trio af
ford, an. abundance of fun. . Walter Le
Roy and Florence Clayton made a de
cided hit in an Irish comedy, "A Horse
on - Hogan," and Etelle and Babette
d'Arville. acrobatic singing girls, intro
duce many new features in their line.
Harry Seeback punches the. bag in a
fashion that would- bring .envy to pro
fessional pugilists. He entertained the
audience for many minutes and his
work was out of the, ordinary line.
Green and Werner, as babes of the
jungle, are, heartily encored. Glllihan
and Murray, singing and dancing come
dians, continue to j do ; excellent work.
The : Leigh brothers, acrobats, and the
motion pictures, all of which are new
and. interesting, complete the show.
For two acts one saw no reason why
they shouldn't. Though the comedy is
not a political satire, . nor indeed a
satire of any sort; It Is bright, original,
amusing â for two acts and part of the
third. The people in it are live people.
The situations are possible and neatly
posed. The action Is quick, the dia
logue bright, and above all 'these is a
fresh. Western, tone to the piece that
comes with- agreeable pungency to the
jaded appetite. % The Honorable John
North is a Seattle politician running
for Governor, and a divorced man with
a second wife, with strong prejudices
.against divorce,, and whom he has
therefore kept in ignorance of the fact.'
He* returns from' a successful campaign
to find his first wife installed as French
teacher to his second wife's daughter,
and with a pretty. blackmailing scheme
for fiis own annoyance.
. .One is plunged without ado into the
heart of the story, that goes - with a
swing until the third act. The author
has prepared for the disaster, however,
by giving the adventuress an impossi
ble pretended son in the act before.
This son, a Chimmie Fadden sort of
chentleman, hides behind a piano and
plays a hoodlum Banquo at a banquet
in the good old conventional farcical
fashion, and Mr. Bashford becomes im
mediately unconvincing where he be
comes conventional. - New York looks a
long way off for "the honorable John"
during, this scene. Yet it were easily
redeemableâ space alone debars me
from the essential suggestion. The
fourth act picks up again, and the play
as a whole leaves a distinctly pleasant
impression. The wholesale laughter and
applause last night testified to an un
common enjoyment on. the, audience's
part. Â¦ . .Â¦;â¢.!
Mr. Stockwell has gathered a clever
company together for the production.
As John North he is himself ablv . hu
morous and convincing.. .Mrs. Belmour
is admirable as Mrs. North, and. Miss
Xevada Hefron is an excellent adven
turess. Charles Erin Verner as a French
Count looking for an heiress is delight
fully clever, and Miss Hannon. Louis
Belmour. Marion Drewe .and- Maurice
Hyde-Chick all deserve more than mere
mention. BLANCHE PARTINGTON. .
For two acts "The Honorable John
North" at the California last night
looked like "a' rattling success"-r-what
ever that may happen to mean. ' "The
Honorable John North" is of local
growth, a "political satire," in four acts
(per programme), .by Herbert Bash
ford, who . is well known to the local
magazine readers. I-.. R. Stockwell and
his company produced the play, in
which they have toured for some time,
and in which they hope to take New
York. " c :

Geber ate a hearty meal and went to
his room in a small addition to the
house, fituated in the rear of the dwell
ing. His Furlinoss caused Hartmann
fr. to discharge the fellow.
The elder Hartmann had been warned
against Geber !>y his son Joseph, who
v.orked with the man in the Hartmann
faint shon. The young man had no
tired a few day? ago an ugly looking
plu-pshot on Geber*a person. On being
asked why he carried the weapon
Geber answered. "Oh. 1 drive nails with
At about 9 o'clock he accosted Charles
Hartmann in the yard in front of the
houFP. "I want some breakfast, and
I want it now," he said, preceding his
demand with a foul oath.
Youn? Hartmann answered in a good
r.atured way. "Well, come ahead; you
can have mine."
The shooting occurred at the Hart
mann home, 321 Third street, where
G^ber has been obtaining board and
lodging as part payment for his work
at Hartmann's paint shop. Geber rose
early In the morning In a very surly
mood and attended.'to his work In the
ftables.
Because he was discharged from a
position that netted him $2 50 a week
August Geber, alias Schell, yesterday
tried to exterminate the family of Â£is
former employer, George Hartmann Sr.
One of Hartmann's sons, Charles, aged
19 years, was shot In the throat and al
most Instantly killed by Geber. An
other eon, George Hartmann Jr., re
ceived a bullet through the arm as he
tried to close a door upon the frenzied
murderer.
