VOLUME XCVITâNO. 41.
FIGHT FOR TOGA WAXES HOT IN CAPITAL CITY
YESTERDAY was the liveliest day Sacramento has had during the present session of the Legislature. The Senatorial fight assumed pro
portions that made many of the old-time politicians think of days gone by. The headquarters of the aspirants for the toga were thronged
all day with men who have interested themselves in the fight between the north and the south. Rumors of orders from the railroad were
rife, and these naturally tended to excite the interest of those who have votes and those who want them. George Knight claimed the toga
immediately upon the arrival of his law partner, bearing a letter from Senator Perkins, in which the latter assured Knight that he would be
an acceptable colleague. But his claim did not affect the other aspirants. The meeting of the Electoral College was an inter
esting feature of the day.

Operations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 9.âAn explosion
which bids fair to rival the Chadwick
exploit in some respects is promised
fn the ease of Mrs. Alice Webb Duke,
â¢wife of Brodie L. Duke, the son of
Washington Duke, the tobacco mer
chant. The incarceration of the
bridegroom in a private insane asylum
on Long Island a few days after his
marriage in New York to the Chicago
woman, and the bitter fight now being
made by the bride for his release,
charging fraud and conspiracy, led to
a scandal. This, it is said by those
claiming to know, is only at its be
ginning. It is claimed that men of
prominence in New York, Chicago,
Pittsburg and other cities are in
volved.
. Alice L. Webb, as she is known in
a business way, was and is yet asso
ciate.! with Charles F. Taylor in busi
ness in room 514 of the Continental
Bank building, 218 La Salle street. The
â¢ firm is knÂ»7\vn as Taylor, Webb
& Co.. the Texas-Cuba Tobacco
Company and the Nacogdoches Tobac
co Company of Nacogdoches, Texas.
Alice L. Webb is president and Taylor
is tht- secretary and treasurer. The
partnership was formed for the pur
pose of ' forming, promoting and as
sisting, financially or otherwise, com
panies, syndicates, partnerships adn
associations of all kinds, commercially
undertaken by contractors, capitalists,
financiers, etc."
Alice L. Webb is said to have first
met Brodia L. Duke in seeking to
Interest him in land deals and to
bacco plantations in Nacogdoches. It
â¢is said that she and Taylor needed
aVbout $150,000 for the purpose of pro
moting property, and Duke was finally
induced to invest $40,000, but whether
the.money was paid over or not ib
not made clear.
Before the woman had known Duke
long she went to New York, and on
December 21 they were married.
In Chicago Miss Webb lived at 427
Forty-seventh street with her maid.
She was exclusive and passed as the
wealthy divorced wife of E. H. Powell,
a former Pittsburg hotel proprietor.
A story is afloat that she abandoned
her apartments and creditors swooped
down upon the place. It is declared
that the Arm that sold her the fur
nishing for her fiat secured an attach
ment and tradesmen of every class
clamored for payment. This is de
nied, however, by her friends, who as
sert that she had plenty of money.
rWhen she left it wa3 rumored that
she had gone away with her business
partner, but this Taylor denied em
phatically. He declared the firm's
business took them out of town very
often. He said:
"Mrs. Duke is really the daughter of
the late William H. Webb, the wealthy
corporation lawyer of New York.
When her father died ten years ago
he left her $100,000 and she engaged
in business. She did not care for so
ciety and proved to be a very shrewd
"business woman. She told me that
her first husband, Powell, had squan
dered her fortune. Since forming the
partnership I have been associated
with Miss Webb in many business ven
tures. She is still the Junior member
of the firm."
NEW YORK, Jan. 9.âThe announce
ment was made to-day that Lawrence
Duke, son of Brodie L. Duke, recently
committed to a sanitarium on the or
der of a magistrate, had taken initial
steps to secure the annulment of his
father's marriage to Miss Alice Webb.
What turn the investigation by District
Attorney Jerome may take is yet uncer
tain, but it was said that there would
certainly be no immediate arrest in the
case, the investigation not having
reached a stage where a criminal pros
ecution involving such action was pos
sible.
John D. Lindsay, attorney for Law
rence Duke, said to-day that he knew
nothing about a statement attributed
to Mrs. Duke that an offer of $300,000
had been made to her on condition that
she consent to the annulment of her
marriage. He said that he was confi
dent that no offer hud been made.

IS GRANTED
A DIVORCE
Pittsburg Millionaire
Loses Case by
Default
Allegations of Gross Indig
. nities Form Ground
ol Complaint.
Wife Gives Sensational Recital of
Incidents Revealing Husband's
Cruelty.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Jan. 9.âJudge
Evans to-day handed down a decree of
divorce to Eliza Sutton McKee from
A. Hart McKee, the Pittsburg million
aire, who lately caused much comment
by traveling to and in Europe with
Mrs. Hugh Tevis of California, McKee
made no defense.
Mrs. McKee was granted a divorce
on the ground of indignities so gross
and frequent that she was forced to
withdraw to the shelter of her father's
home. After reciting the history of
her marriage to the young millionaire,
Mrs. McKee said to-day:
"After our marriage we went abroad,
returning in February. 1893. I suffered
the greatest indifference and neglect
during our trip abroad, and I was very
much neglected while at the Hotel
Metropole, Monte Carlo. This was in
January. 1903. I was very ill at the
time and when I went to that hotel I
had no attendant âno one but Mr. Mc-
Kee with me. I was left there alone
and a servant finally discovered my
condition. A physician found me there
alone in a dangerous condition and he
remained there with me until 12 o'clock
at night, until Mr. McKee could be
found.
"After we returned to this country
Mr. McKee's treatment was unkind. On'
one occasion he said to me that the
house and everything in the house be
longed to him; that I had no right
there, except what he saw fit to give
me. He called me insulting names. He
threatened to make me cringe and that
he would make the place ring with re
ports of me. On one occasion he threw
a loaded revolver across my body. On
another occasion he threatened that
his mother would break my neck.
There were several instances of vio
lence at times when I was ill, two oc
casions being at the births of my two
children.
"During that time Mr. McKee re
moved the doors between his room and
the room occupied by myself and a
trained nurse. He would arrange the
mirrors so that he could watch this
young woman in all her movements
about the room, her patient and the
baby. I requested that the doors be
put back; I begged that they be put
back. He refused to have them put
back.
"On one occasion I went to a bath
room adjoining my own room and
locked the door. Mr. McKee appeared
at the door and demanded that it be
opened. I said that I would open it
when I was through with the room
He then picked up a chair and bat
tered in the door."
R. A. Booth May Be Drawn Into Port
land Inquiry.
PORTLAND, Jan. 9.âlt is stated
that the suspension of Booth and
Bridges of the Roseburg, Land Office
foreshadows an investigation by the
Grand Jury and subsequent indict
ment. It is also said that State Sen
ator R. A. Booth, a brother of the re
ceiver, may be involved in the case.
It is alleged that the Senator had
an arrangement with his brother
whereby the Land Office could be
opened at any time in the night to re
ceive filings when so desired by the
Senator or his friends.
I to a sanitarium and the sensational de-
I velopments growing out of the case
i were investigated to-day by District
Attorney Jerome. The affidavit on
which the commitment was issued was
made public to-day by Justice Wyatt.
It bears the name of Victor G. MltliCh
of this city, but does not give his oc
cupation.
Assistant District Attorney Lord said
that he understood that the manage
ment of the Park Avenue Hotel, where
Mr. and Mrs. Duke had been stopping,
had made the first complaint, which re
sulted in Duke's removal to Bellevue
Hospital.

SECRECY SURROUNDS
SACRAMENTO MARRIAGE
Miss Gertrude Dockweiler Becomes
the Bride of William V.
MacNevin.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9. âWilliam
V. MacNevin and Gertrude Dockwei
ler were married in this city at 2
o'clock last Saturday afternoon by
Justice of the Peace Arthur H. Mc-
Curdy. The ceremony was witnessed
by courthouse attaches. The bride
appeared to be about 19 years old
and the groom 24. They spent Sat
urday night at a downtown hotel and
left Sunday for San Francisco.
The secrecy which seemed to sur
round the marriage gave rise to the
belief about the courthouse that it
was a runaway match.
Alaska Railroad Sold.
SEATTLE. Jan. 9.âThe Alaska
Central Railroad,'building from Sew

has changed hands. Canadian capi
talists, following the advice of ex-
Senator George Turner, who is attor
ney for the road, have purchased the
interest owned by Shedd Bros, of Chi
cago. The Chicago capitalists did not
want to build more than twenty miles
a year. This did not suit the stock
holders, so the sale was perfected.

TREASURER
FOR DODGE
IN FLIGHT
Latest Witness to
Escape From .
Jerome.
NEW YORK, Jan. 9.âEdward J.
Bracken, whose presence is so greatly
needed by District Attorney Jerome as
a witness in the Dodge-Morse case, is
no longer in this country. On good
authority it was learned to-day that
he is probably at this time somewhere
abroad, having sailed from Halifax.
He returned to New York from Texas,
where he had Â«cted as treasurer for
Charles F. Dodge, two days before
Dodge was brought here *oy sea. After
a brief conference with a relative he
visited his house in Harlem under the
very eyes of two detectives and im
ada.
Bracken succeeded in reaching his
home here while it was being watched
fey the detectives by taking a round
about route and gaining it from the
rear by climbing several fences. He
ran almost into the arms of the two
detectives and then decided quickly to
get out of town again.
It was through his evidence that
Jerome hoped to learn where the
money came from which was supplied
so liberally to Dodge during all the
monthsÂ»that his extradition from Texas
was being contested after his indict
ment here for perjury last winter.
Bracken was Dodge's constant com
panion and from some source had
plenty of money to settle Dodge's bills.

Special Difpatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9.âln the,
preliminary canvassing to-night the
conference at Bard headquarters
called together more than twenty
members of the Legislature. It was
the largest demonstration of actual
strength so far made in favor of any
aspirant for United States Senator.
The general judgment of onlookers
inclines to the view that Frank P.
Flint will get more votes on the first
ballot to-morrow than any other can
didate, but there are some predictions
that Bard will take the first place.
All along the line the Southern
Pacific political agents are hammering
Bard and asserting that he has not a
ghost of a chance to win out. The
Knight boomers are very much
elated over the assurances of esteem
and personal friendship which Senatot
Perkins now conveys to Knight. This
is accepted as quite a triumph of
Knight over Fisk.
Assemblyman Held of Mendocino,
who has been rated in some quarters
as a Bard man and in other directions
as an "undercover" Flint man, has
been captured by Knight. A deluge
of telegrams from Ukiah importun
ing Held to stand up for Knight had
the desired effect.
Frank P. Flint's round-up of the
Los Angelas delegation at the French
restaurant this evening was an inter
esting event. The Los Angeles candi
date gave the programme for to
morrow's work to his immediate
supporters in the Legislature.
LUKENS TO BE ABSENT.
Senator Russ Lukens fof Alameda
will not be present when the vote on
Senator Is taken to-morrow. He is
going to San Francisco to see his
father and mother off on a trip
around the world, which they begin
that day. Senator LUkens has openly
expressed himself as believing that the
next Senator should come from the
south and he is rated as a strong ad
mirer of Senator Bard. He is rated
in the present fight as a Bard man.

SENATORIAL EIGHT
LIFTS LOAD
FROM MIND
OF KNIGHT
Perkins Lays Ghost
That Has Haunt
ed the Orator.
Lawyer Receives a
Letter From Sen
ior Senator.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9.âThere is
exultation in the camp of George A.
Knight. Knight and his supporters
feel that they have laid a ghost that
has been stalking about frightening
away men they said would be first
and last for the United States com
mitteeman but for the presence of
this specter. This ghost was in the
shape of the rumored opposition of
Senator Perkins to Knight's aspira
tions and this morning Knight deter
mined to still the rumors or verify
them beyond a question, sent the fol
lowing telegram to Senator Perkins:
"It is openly said here that some of
your friends are opposing my election
to the Senate because you are interest
ed in my defeat. Will you state wheth
er my candidacy Is antagonistic to your
Interests, and whether you are opposed
to my election? answer at my
expense."
Now, here comes the unlooked for co
incidence. Up to dark Knight had re
ceived no response to his telegram, but
the 8:30 train brought Charles J. Heg
gerty, who carried several letters to
his law partner. Among them was one
from Senator Perkins bearing date of
January 3, which had been addressed
to Knight's office in San Francisco.
This letter immediately brought the
smiles to Knight's face, but It was only
after consultation with his supporters
that he decided to make the most inter
esting portion of it public.
"I would not make this public," said
Knight, "except that some of those that
ar> opposing me are stating that my
election would displease Senator Per
kins, and they are trying to make po
litical capital out of this assertion, and
undoubtedly it has had considerable
effect upon many of his friends. This
letter, however, lays at rest all of these
assert inns, the portion directly refer
ring to this point being as follows:
"I hear from our mutual friends in
California that your Senatorial chances
are very bright. I am sure there is
none more interested in your success
and good fortune than myself. In
this connection it may not be improper
for me to state that I have received
numerous telegrams and letters from
friends of other candidates for the
Senatorship who wish me to made
declaration in their favor, but have
stated that you were my personal
friend and that you had not asked
me to declare in your favor, but sim
ply to state that you would be an ac
ceptable colleague.
"Your action In this respect has been
most generous in relieving me from
embarrassment with my present col
league, as you know my feelingâof
friendship toward your good self. With
best wishes for your success, etc."
While there is no direct assertion on
the part of Senator Perkins in the let
ter that he would lend his influence to
assist in the election of Knight the
last-named points to the fact that Sen
ator Perkins frankly states that he has
refused his support to those that are
opposing Knight. This is a sufficient
guarantee to Knight that his election
would be pleasing to Senator Perkins
and that Perkins may be counted
among his friends. In consequence,
this letter is the basis of renewed activ
ity in Knight's stronghold.

CAMPAIGN ENLIVENED BY ARRIVAL
OF FLINT "BOOSTERS."
MEN FROM SOUTH PAY NOISY TRIBUTE
TO THEIR CANDIDATE.
Continued from Page 1, Column 5.
Flint noise is in the air here to-night.
The Los Angeles man Is the only Sen
atorial candidate who is bringing
"shouting and tumult" into his cam
paign and whether it Is making him
any votes or not it is certainly giving
his fight a spectacular aspect. More
than half a score more of enthusiastic
Flint "boosters" reached Sacramento
to-day from the south. Among them
were William P. Jeffries, engraver and
printer; John Summerfield, Deputy
Coroner; Claude Parker, Deputy Coun
ty Auditor; J. L. Flanagan, capitalist;
W. C. Patterson, president of the Los
Angeles National Bank; Dr- G. W.
Campbell; Cal Hart well, County Re
corder; Mark Jones, County Treasurer;
Judge William P. James and Motley H.
Flint, postmaster, all of Los Angeles,
and Major James Campbell, City
Treasurer of Pasadena, and J. W.
Walker, an orange grower of Orange
County.
VISIT FLINT'S RIVALS.
After demonstrations In the hotel
corridors the new Los Angeles arrivals
and those "boosters" already on the
ground and who had joined them, voted
to visit the headquarters of all the
opposing candidates. Led by Jeffries
and Leo Youngworth they first stormed
the rooms of George A. Knight and
gave three cheers for him. Each was
introduced in turn to Knight and he
made a speech, thanking them for the
call. They departed with Candidate
Knight's happiest smile glowing full
upon them.
Into Henry Oxnard's headquarters
was sent a card bearing the inscription.
"Oscar Lawler and the Los! Angeles
bunch." Oxnard shook hands down the
line, and after listening to cheers for
himself said:
"I thank you for your expressions of
friendship and wish to say that, wheth
er I am elected or not, I think the place
should go to a southern man."
Arthur Fisk listened appreciatively
to the cheers when the crowd reached
his headquarters, and met the attack
by saying he intended to be the next
T'nited States Senator.
At Senator Bard's headquarters the
Flint people fell In with old friends,
with only political differences to divide
them, and a* exchange of banter fol
lowed the cheers. Frank Brandon on
behalf of Bard expressed thanks for
the call.
Flint sat down to dinner In a private
apartment at a local rotisserie to-night
with his supporters in the : outhern
delegation and several of the boosters.
There was a caucus over the viands,
and it was decided what course the
delegation should pursue to-morrow. It
is understood that plenty of noise from
the "boosters" chorus whenever any
thing drops Flint's way will be part of
the programme.
ELECTORAL COLLEGE
CASTS CALIFORNIA'S
VOTE FOR PRESIDENT
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9.âWith most
impressive ceremonies, witnessed by
hundreds of visitors who thronged the
Assembly chamber of the Capitol, the
formalities attending the casting of j
California's ten electoral votes for |
President and Vice President of the i
United States were carried out this j
afternoon. Although the change of I
years has destroyed the necessity for ,
the electoral college and while It was
known ever since the Bth of November
last that California's electoral votes
were to be cast for Roosevelt and Fair
banks, this fact did not rob the pro
ceedings of any of their interest. The
spectacle was arranged with the great
est regard to details and the event was
one not soon to be forgotten.
The programme was opened at 2
o'clock with a medley of national airs
by a stringed orchestra. As the strains
were continued the Presidential electors
were escorted to their seats on the
Speaker's platform by Governor Par
dee, Lieutenant Governor Alden An
derson, Secretary of State Curry, Pres
ident Pro Tempore Wolfe of the Sen
ate, Speaker Prescott or the Assembly,
Chairman Stone and Secretary Wood
ward of the Republican State Commit
tee.
Brief Introductory remarks were
made by General George Stone. With
due solemnity Secretary of State Curry
presented the Governor's certificate for
electors of President and Vice Presi
dent of the United States. The ad
ministration of the oath of office to
electors was carried out by Judge E.
C. Hart of the Sacramento Superior
Court. The electors are William S.
Wood, U- S. Grant Jr., Edward Swee
ney, C. M. Hammond, Francis M.
Smith, William J. Dingee. George H.
Pippy, Morris B. Harris, C. J. Walker
and Richard Melrose.
U. S. Grant Jr. then nominated Wil
liam S. Wood chairman of the college.
In taking his office Wood delivered the
following address:
"The mode of electing the President
long baffled the convention and was
one of the most perplexing and momen
tous questions with which the body had
to deal. Finally, by one of the cele
brated compromises of the constitution,
it was voted that the selection of the
President should be confided to electors
in each State, appointed as the Legis
lature might direct, and to equal in
number the representation of the State
ln Congress.
"The original design and purpose of
the office of Presidential elector con
templated a body of men chosen be
cause it was expected that they would
be the best men in their respective
States, who, in their unfettered discre
tion, would choose the fittest man for
President in all the country. They
would be wholly Independent and un
pledged; and yet, by usage alone, the
electors have lost all their indepen
dence of action and have become mere
cogs in the machinery by which a Pres
ident is elected.
"This loss of the active exercise of the
powers of the electors has been accom
plished without depriving ahem of any
of their legal powers. Any electors
could vote for any native-born citizen
of the United States of the age of 35
years and his vote would be counted.
The electors are under no legal obliga
tion to vote for Roosevelt and Fair
banks, but are bound to so vote by the
unwritten law, which by' long use has
become of equal force and dignity with
constitutional and statutory provisions.
"It has been proposed to abolish or
change the system of the electoral col
lege and proceed to the election of

TAXES THE ENERGIES OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE MEN WILLING TO ACCtPl Irit
HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE GOLDEN STATE AT THE CAPITAL OF THE NATION
The advent of Ruef, with renewed
instructions from the Southern Pacific
office that the Republicans of the Leg
islature must take either Knight or
Flint causes Indignation in the ranks
of the stalwarts. If Ruef programmes
Flint, George Knight will roar as no
statesman ever before roared. The in
dications to-night seem favorable to
Flint's selection by Ruef, although
nothing will be definitely settled until
the development of strength by each
of the aspirants is made.
NOT FOR SHORTRIDGE.
Samuel M. Shortridge arrived here
to-day and the gossips soon had it that
he was a horse of the darkest hue and
that he had arrived at the brightest
hour to shape his career. But Short
ridge would not have it that he is here
as a dark horse and said that he had
come on only- as a spectator.
"I am here to see a Republican elect
ed to the United States Senate," said
Shortridge, "and to get pleasure from
the contemplation that in a measure I
aided in securing the splendid Republi
can victory that so utterly eliminates
any Democrat, no matter how great
he be, from the contest. I have long
been of record as saying that the Sen
ator this time should come from South
ern California and my measure of influ
ence will be bent to this purpose. But
any statement that I have Joined in the
open espousal or caucus of any of the
candidates is not true. I am Just here
to watch, not to fight."
William H. Brown, formerly of El
Dorado County, also came to town to
day. He is one of the old-timers in
politics. He was in Stanford's fight
and voted for General Miller for United
States Senator when PerkinÃ was Gov
ernor. At one time he was a member
of the State Harbor Commission. He
hopes to see Knight elected Senator.
John T. Dare, United States Ap
praiser, is also here. He says he Is
not in the fight, but that if: he had it
to decide Knight would be the Senator.
Henry Ach is another of the San
Francisco politicians who reached
here to-night.
The news that F. S. Stratton has
1 fteh reappointed to the Collectorship
Of Port'of San Francisco is taken here
as favorable to the candidacy of Sen
ator Bard. Stratton's influence, it is
thought, will be turned in Bard's dl
rectlon in return for Senator Bard's
good offices in relation to securing for
Stratton the office he will continue to
hold for. the four years.
The Presidential Electors who re
mained in Sacramento to-night dined
with Governor Pardee at the latter's
residence. U. S. Grant left the Capitol
tor San Diego at 5:55 o'clock.
Major Charles Hardy of San Diejro
Is here in the interest of Frank P.
Flint's candidacy and ex-State Senator
E. C. Seymour of San Bernardino is
here advocating the re-election of Sen
ator Bard.
President in other ways, such as a di
rect vote of the whole people, a propor
tional vote, and a vote for electors m
Congressional districts, but to each of
these serious objections have been
raised and the present system will be
continued until, as in the convention,
some happy compromise is suggested.
"And now, when the votes to which
the State of California is entitled are
about to be cast, the electors may con
gratulate themselves that they have
the distinguished privilege of being one
of the bodies whose immediate votes in
thirty-two States of the Union, will
name for President and Vice President
of the United States two. eminent men,
distinguished in ability and statesman
ship, of conceded courage and integrity,
of tried and proved characters, and in
every way fully equipped for the high
Stations to which they will be elected
and further, that in each case they are
acting in consonance with the expecta
tion at the time their office was created
WT casting the votes of California for
the fittest man in all the country.
"And finally, the electors of the State
of California may at this time consider
with great satisfaction that as citizens
or this great commonwealth, proud of
h e K Vem w n 18 and hap Py ln
pects, they have been called to repre

The Electors then signed the three

to deposit the certificate in the nost

States to Judge de Haven of the United
States District Court. unuea
Colonel George H. Pippy was select
ed to carry the votes of the Electoral
College to Congress. The honor was
formally bestowed upon him by Chair
man Wood. His appointment was de
termined on after a contest in caucus
held Just before the exercises were
commenced.
Governor Pardee, appreciative of the
dignity of the office that was beins
performed in the Assembly chamber
made this dignity the keynote of his
address.
There Is too little cerenjony in the
induction into the great offices at the
head of this Government, he said, and
It was with pleasure that he noted that
the people, mindful of the height to
which man reached when he was se
lected as the President of all Ameri
cans, had gathered in such force to
witness the formality of casting the
electoral ballot for Roosevel. and Fair
banks.
Toward the close of the ceremonies
Colonel Pippy Introduced a resolution
commendatory of the loyal and effic
ient work done by the State Central
Committee during the last campaign
and particularly that of General George
Stone, its chairman, and E. F. Wood
ward, secretary. That the resolution
met with popular approval was man
ifested by the outburst of applause it
received.
PRESCOTT'S
APPOINTEES
MADE PUBLIC
Few Surprised by
Speakers Com
mittee List.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9.âSpeaker
Prescott fooled a number of doubting
Assemblymen this morning by an
nouncing the committees for the House.
There were few surprises for those on
the inside, but some of the members
were disappointed at what was handed
out to them. There was little open ex
pression of dissatisfaction.
The Assembly also reached the intro
duction of bills. Under a new method
âdrawing names of the members to be
recognized from a hatâthis work was
expedited and a flood of measures
swamped the unfortunate clerks behind
the desk, who are among the few who
have to work for their . diem.
Houser introduced the bill providing
'for three additional Superior Judges
for Los Angeles County, and, retaining
the floor, said:
"I ask, Mr. Speaker, that as the ap
pointing of these Judges is a matter of
urgency, and as the Los Angeles joint
delegation has caucused and agreed on
its passage, it be placed at once on the
second reading file that it may be
passed as early as possible."
"I would ask," said Anthony of Can
Francisco, "whether this bill carries an
appropriation with it?"
"The salaries of the new Judges will
have to be paid in part by the State, '
replied Speaker Prescott. "and an ap
propriation will be necessary to meet
its share."
"1 think' the action requested v.ould
be premature," said McGowan from
the San Francisco side. "Others here
have similar bills to Introduce and they
can't all be granted this favor."
"Do I understand there is an objec
tion, Mr. McGowan?" asked the
Speaker.
"I think we shall object," was Mc-
Gowan's reply.
"The bill will take its regular course,
Mr. Houser," said the Speaker. "It
looks as if Los Angeles and San Fran
cisco would better caucus on the mat
ter."
And that Is what they will have to
do, for the San Franciscans want the
salaries of .superior Judges in their
city raised to $6000 a year.
Among the- bills introduced was one
by Jones of Tuolumne, asking an ap
propriation of $300,000 for a hotel in the
Yosemite Valley.
Estudillo of Riverside introduced a
measure calling for a Joint investiga
tion of the water resources of the
State. This is of especial importance
to the people of Southern California
and Los Angeles, which city, it is said,
is already facing a serious problem in
the obtaining of an adequate water
supply and in making provision for
future growth.
San * rancisco got two places on the
Ways and Means Committeeâone more
than it has ever had before.
McCartney, who doesn't seem to
have much of A romantic spirit, put
in a bill that *iIL prevent eluoenrfnts
if it becomes a law. It provides that
a marriage license,can be obtained
only after a notice of five days and
that the marriage, must take place In
the county where the bride resides.
Both parties must appear when the
license is granted.
McCartney presented a basketful of
bills, many of them relating to di
vorce. Ore provides that an attorney
shall be appointed for defendants In
divorce suits who are not represented.
He also introduced a bill establishing
Saturday from r.oon as a half holiday.
Mindham of San Francisco County
introduced a bill to cause the payment
of 135,135 to Patrick Creighton for
money allesed to be due him by San
Francisco for street work done in
1869, 1870 and 1872.
A department of music at Berkeley
is asked for in a bill presented by
Pfaeffif of San Francisco. It calls for
a professorship at $3000 a year and an
appropriation of $6000.
The Assembly broke the record to
day in the introduction of bills. Dur
ing the morning session 164 were in
troduced, read and referred in fifty
five minute. Chief Clerk. Clio Lovd
was highiy complimented by Assem
blymen on the way he carried on his
work. Including the afternoon ses
sion. 177 bills were introduced and not
a thing will be left over for to-mor
row.

POCKETS OF SOLONS BULGE WITH
ALL KINDS OF BILLS.
SAN FRANCISCO SUPERVISORS
INTERESTED IN TWO MEASURES
WOLFE WANTS A TWELVE-HOUR DAY
FOR FIREMEN OF THIS CITY.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9. âSenator
Charles M. Shortridge, who says he
will oppose all new legislation, hold
ing that the people are destroying
their liberties by creating a surplus of
petty restrictions, received a shock
this morning when President Ander
son called for bills. For an hour
proposed bills and amendments
poured over the desk in a steady
stream, and there were bulging pocÂ«
kets still when the hour for adjourn
ment came. It is possible that all day
to-morrow will be occupied in calling
the roll and announcing the titles of
measures prepared.
Prior to the introduction of bills,
however, an important joint resolu
tion, having the indorsement and sup
port of the California Viticultural
Club, was presented by Senator Wood
ward of Santa Rosa. This resolution
has in view the defeat of the recom
mendation of Internal Revenue Com
missioner Yerkes that a tax be Im
posed upon grape brandies used in the
fortification of sweet wines. It is as
follows:
TAX ON GRAPE BRANDY.
Whereat, Commissioner Yerkes of the In
ternal Kevenue Service of the United States,
In his annual report to the Congress of ttye
I'nlted States, recommends the levying of a
minininin tax upon the grape brandy now used
in the foititication of sweet wines manufac
tured within the United States, amounting to
twenty-five csnts per proof gallon, and
Wh-treas. undeniable proof has been pre
sented to this body that suCh tax is exorbitant,
unjust and that in effect it would absolutely
destroy that part of the viticultural Interests
of this State, and
Whereas. California is the largest grape
growing State In the Union and th~ largest
producer of sweet wines manufactured withtu
the Inited States, and
Whereas., the viticultural Interests, .â¢ both
growers and manufacturers, in all parts of the
State have unanimously protested against any
meas'tre being enacted into law by the Nation
al Contftaa providing for such tax,
Therefore lie it resolved, that the Senate
of the State of California, tare Assembly coil
curring. hereby directs the Senators of the
State or California and hereby requests UV
Representatives of the State of California m
the National Congress at Washington, to ener
getically and unalterably oppose the enactment
into law ofvsuch an act, 01 of any act having
any such tendency.
Be it "rosÂ«.lv*d. That the Secretary of the
Senate is hereby directed to telegraph the sub
stance <:i thcie res.Unions to each Senator and
Representative of the State of California in
Washington, and
Be tt further resolved, That the Secretary
of State is hereby directed to send ty mail
tortkWith, certified copies of this resolution to
Â«-ach of our Senators and Representatives in
Washington.
The resolution was referred to the
Committee on Fruit and Vine Inter
ests, with instructions that it report
tOA'naorrow at which time the resolu
tion will be made the special order.
DEPOSITORIES WANTED.
The Senate was also memorialized ]
by the Board of Supervisors of San i
Francisco tlds morning. The board, j
in its memorial, requests the L'igisla- j
ture to take action on two important |
matters directly affecting the funds in
the municipal treasury. The more
important of the two relates to the
establishment of depositories for pub
lic funds, it being the desire of the
bo;:rd that the present law be
amended, or, in other words, that f a
constitutional amendment be provided
for, by which the municipal govern
ment shall have the right to deposit
its moneys with certain institutions at
interest, the moneys so deposited to
be secured by United States, State,
municipal or school bonds of greater
value than the moneys so deposited.
This measure has the support of not
only the San Francisco delegation,
but of the delegations of all of the
large cities of the State.
The second petition of the San
Francisco board provides for the ex
tension of time in which claims may
be filed for the refunding of taxes il
legally collected. The present law
frequently works a hardship, the dis
covery of Illegal collections often not
being made until near the time
for the filing of claims for refunding
the same has expired.
The recent request of Police Com-,
missloner Hutton of San Francisco that
his associates on the board join with
him. in a request to the City Attorney
for an opinion as to whether the board
had the power to dismiss police officers
without trial will result in the presen
tation to-morrow by Senator Wolfe of
a bill to forestall any such action on
the part of the city official. Hutton
claims that the section of the charter
guaranteeing every police officer the
right of trial is in conflict with section
16 article 20 of the State constitution,
which provides that the tenure of
every office not fixed by law is at the
pleasure of the appointing power.
Wolfe will Introduce a bill providing
for the exclusion from the effect of
this provision of the constitution of
every police officer, teacher, etc., whose
term is not fixed by law, employed by
any municipality that is governed by
a legally adopted charter.
. SHORT HOURS FOR FIREMEN.
Wolfe will ajso present a bill limiting
the hours of the members of the Fire
Department of San Francisco to
twelve hours a day. Wolfe points out
that under the present system, where
the men are on duty day and night,
they are practically prisoners, ire
denied the right to live with, or the
time to even associate with, their fam
ilies. He also points to the good re
sults of the bill limiting the hours of

the police force of San Francisco to
eight hours a day and says that in
view of the fact that the policemen
were granted this great concession
he Is sure the people of San Fran
cisco will not object to giving the men
that risk their lives to save the lives
and property of others the privilege of
living as white men should.
Amons the most important bills In
troduced to-day was one by Senator
Wolfe providing for the appropriation
of $150,000 to be placed at the disposal
of the trustees of the State Normal
School at San Francisco for the pur
chase of a site and the construction
and furnishing of a building. The bill
provides that not more than $50,000 of
the sum shall be used for the purchase
of a site and $10,000 for the furnishings,
the balance to be used in the construc
tion of a building.
Senator Markey introduced a bill
that if carried means much to San
Francisco. It provides for the appro
priation of $100,000 for the purchase of
a fire boat to be stationed at San
Francisco, the the same
to be \mder the supervision of a "com
mission of four members ij to serve
without pay. Upon the completion of
the boat, if the measure, is carried, it
will be turned over to the. Fire Com
mission of San Francisco and will be
under the direct control of the Chief
Engineer of the metropolis.
Senator Keane introduced a bill that
will probably receive the indorsement
of the United States army. Its terms
prohibit the selling or giving away of
liquors, within a radius of 1000 feet of
any military reservation in the State,
provides for the condemning of saloons
within such radius as public nuisances
and makes it a misdemeanor to violate
the' provisions of the bill. ' (
Senator Nelson also introduced a
bill that will prove of interest to the
police department of San Francisco. It
provides for the purchase of a police
patrol boat at a sum not to exceed
Â§10,000. Nelson says he is going to
center much energy in an effort to car
ry this bill as San Francisco is .the
only important seacoast city in the
United States that has not at least
one police boat.
Following the casting of the ballot
for Roosevelt and Fairbanks by the
electorial college, the Senate recon
vened and upon motion of Senator
Leavitt immediately took up the ques
tion of per diem and mileage of the
electors. A bill providing for the ap
propriation of $558 21 to cover these
points was immediately passed and
transmitted to the Assembly, where it
also nassed, and the electors-.were giv
er- Â«heir money with but little delay.

RUEF CALLS
FOLLOWERS
TO A CAUCUS
Tells Faithful Ones
What He Wants
of Them.
Henchmen to Await
Orders From the
Leader.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9.âAbe Ruef ar
| rived from San Francisco to-night and
for half an hour the streets gave back
the echo of scurrying feet. Messengers
were rounding up the faithful, and it
was not long before all Sacramento
knew it. Men whose acquaintance
Ruef has hardly enjoyed wrung his
hand with the warmth of admiration
and hope. And their affection even
I increased when they watched him
| march away to his rooms at 523 X
l street with no less tljan fourteen good
Senatorial votes proud to follow in his
trail.
The word went out that Ruef had ar
rived and that "doings" were at hand.
Candidates stood back and longingly
watched the San Francisco dictator
lead his followers to his place of seclu
sion that they might lend* him their
ears. But before requesting the loan
Ruef decided to count noses to see
whether all were on hand to hearken to
his wisdom. The rollcall disclosed the
presence of Senators Harry Bunkers.
George B. Keane, Frank A. Markey
and John H. Nelson, while the lower
house was represented by Marc An
thony, Thomas E. Atkinson, Samuel H.
Beckett, John A. Cullcn, Gub Hartman,
Fred J. Meincke, William J. Mindham,
Fred V. Severance, Louis Strohl and
Mcl Vogel.
Here were fourteen of the good and
faithful, but Ruef was Informed that
five more San Franciscans would be on
hand at the next caucus and that two
more could not be found, but could be
counted among the loyal and as yet
undeflected owners of Senatorial votes
Then Ruef borrowed the ears of his
little group. He said he had learned
with pleasure of the desire of the San
Francisco delegation to give him its
complimentary vote, but that he did
not desire It to take such action. He
said he was in the fight and that such
action could have no effect otiier than
to reflect honor upon him, but ne would
accept the spirit for the deed in order
to facilitate matters and speed the con
test to a conclusion. He was not pre
pared, however, to suggest which of
the several candidates enjoyed his
favor; this matter would be determined
la ter.
The caucus then discussed the mode
of procedure to be followed by it in
the contest that goes to ballot to-mor
row. It was agreed that throughout
tho contest the legislators pres
ent â¢ should stand as a unit
and vote as the word was
given them. This decision doubtless
ly will further increase the affection
of the candidates for Ruef and his un
swerving delegation.
To-morrow morning at 10 Ruef will
again meet with his delegation, at
which time a candidate wdl be select
ed to bear up under the weight of its
first ballot. It is said J. O. Hayes
of San Jose will receive this first honor
and may continue to receive it until
the crucial hour arrives. Then its
whole strength will be thrown to the
proper one, and out from among the
cheers a. new United States Senator
will arise.
At a late hour Ruef was surrounded
with members of the Legislature and
outside supporters of Several Sena
torial aspirants. He said to a Call
reporter that the logic of the situation
favored a Senator from the south and
as Herrin has given orders that Bard
must not be considered, it is inter
preted that Flint or some other south
erner will get the prize. To a State
Senator Ruef spoke of the responsi
bility attaching to the duty of passing
out the gold brick to either Flint or
Knight.
It is said that the San Francisco
delegation is now in a position to de
cide the issue. The claim is made that
Senator Bauer, who came out for Flint
yeFterday, will act with the city dele
gation.
Let your blunders educate you.

NORTH SEA COMMISSIONERS RESUME
THEIR SESSION IN PARIS.
Admraf F urnier of France Made Chairman of Board
LOSES POSITION
IN WHITE HOUSE
Major Montgomery Unex
pectedly Ordered to Com
mand Company at Benicia
Special Dispatch to The Call.
( ALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.âAn was
issued by the War Department to-day,
by direction of the President, relieving
Major Benjamin F. Montgomery, sig
nal corps,, from duty as chief of the
telegraph and cipher bureau in the
executive office in the White House
and ordering him to Benicia Barracks,
California, to assume command of
Company F, signal corps, on arrival of
that company at that post from the
Philippines, where it has been stationed
for several months past.
Major Montgomery has been in the
White House twenty-eight years- For
fourteen years he was there as an
operator, assigned from the signal
corps, in which he had begun as a
private. Seven years ago he was on
the White House rolls as a clerk and
when the Spanish war came he was
made a captain in the signal corps and
assigned to the White House telegraph
room.
To-day's order came as a complete
surprise to Major Montgomery, who
had been ignorant of the intention to
have him changed from his position.
The order not only relieves Major
Montgomery from duty in the White
House, but also has the effect of re
ducing him to the rank of captain. No
reasons are assigned for the change
except that it was felt at the White
House that the telegraph bureau ought
to be directly under the control of the
secretary to the President.

THE SAN 1 FRAXCISCO CALL. TUESDAY. JANUARY 10. 1905.
DOORS CLOSE
AGAINST HIM
James Caradoc Kees and His
Chinese Valet Persona Xon
Grata at the St. Francis
James Caradoc Rees, gentleman of
leisure of New* York, and his Mon
golian valet, were missed in the lob
by of the St. Francis Hotel last night.
Differences between the management
of the hostelry and Rees as regards
the latter's account with the estab
lishment arose early in the day and
later Rees found his apartments
locked against him. His protests were
of no avail and night found him and
his scowling Chinese attendant look
ing for quarters elsewhere. For sev
eral weeks Rees has been a notice
able figure about the Palace and the
St. Francis. He is the son of a
wealthy resident of New York and a
cousin of Banker Roberts of Ma
dera.
Arriving here from the East, Rees
got apartments at the Palace and then
hurried forth in search of a valet, who
was eventually discovered in the per
son of a Chinese. For a week or more
the visitor attracted considerable at
tention by his eccentricities. Finally
he had some dispute with the man
agement and went to the St. Francis.
Although his account at the Palace
was not paid as promptly as the ho
tel would have it. the management
made no protest, it being understood
that a draft on the senior Rees in
New York would be quickly acknowl
edged.
The St. Francis Hotel, however, had
no such guaranty and when Rees be
gan giving elaborate suppers and ig
noring suggestions from the manage
ment that prompter settlement would
be more pleasing a dispute arose and
for a time the guest and Assistant
Manager Wills were at swords' points.
Their troubles culminated yesterday
when Rocs was ren.uested to call at
the cashier's window, and he refused
to do so. An hour later he was eat
ing a swell luncheon in the ladies'
grill. About that time a porter was
bundling Rees' valet out of his mas
ter's apartments and once vacated the
hotel employe made sure that the
rooms would not again be occupied by
Rees by inserting a check in the lock.
Late last evening Rees visited the ho
tel and demanded admittance to his
rooms, but his request was denied by
the night clerk. He left the estab
lishment in anything but a peaceful
,mood.
Death of Horse Causes Suit.
Colonel G. C. Sawyer brought a suit
yesterday In Judge Van Nostrand's
court to recover $250 alleged to be
the value of a horse that Adam Mil
ler, a liveryman, vr&B boarding. Al
though the horse was owned by Saw
yer, it appears that H. R. Rand, a lo
cal hotel proorietor, was in the habit
of renting the animal. James H. Bab
cock, a restaurant man, was also in
the habit of using the horse. This con
tinued for some time until one day the
horse was brought in a physical
wreck. Despite the services of a vet
erinarian, the animal died. The case
comes up for trial to-day*
Illness generally runs from a person

PRESIDING OFFICER AND MEETING
PLACE OF INTERNATIONAL, NORTH
SKA COMMISSION.
PARIS, Jan. 9. âThe international
commission appointed to inquire into
the North Sea incident resumed its
m BBtoM at the Foreign Office to-day.
Admiral yon Spaun of Austria and
Doubasoff of Russia were present.
The latter's appointment was officially
announced, thus making permanent
Admiral Kaznakoff's retirement on ac
count of illness. Admiral Fournier of
France was unanimously chosen per
manent chairman. In the course of
h;s speech of acceptance Admiral
Fournier said he hoped the commis
sion would be inspired with the same
moderation and wisdom which in
duced Emperor Nicholas and King
Edward to refer the question to arbi
tration.
The admirals have decided thai the
meetings of the commission shall be
semi-public. Admirals Beaumont and
Davis argued for ,full publicity, but the
others considered that that course
would be inconvenient, and finally it
was decided by a unanimous vote to
admit representatives of the press to
hear the testimony of the British and
the Russian witnesses, the admirals'
deliberations remaining private.
The apartment in which the sit
tings of the commission are being held
is one of the most sumptuous salonS
of the French Ministry of Foreign Af
fairs. It is .situated on the second
story, far ing the panorama of the
Seine quays and opposite the Alex
ander 111 bridge and the Palaces of
Fine Arts. The chamber forms part
at M. Delcasse's private apartments
j and is occasionally used by him as a
sitting room.
During the recent visit of the King
and Queen of Italy to France, >vh v
they were lodged at the Foreign Min
istry, this room served as the official
royal drawing-room. It has never be
fore been used for a conference. It
was at one time proposed to put at
the disposal of the commission the
same room which had been used by
the Hispano-American Commissioners,
but it was decided that it would be
better to select entirely new quarters.
The furniture is finely upholstered
and the room is hung with red velvet,
the wood and brass work being richly
gilded. When lighted by electricity
the effect produced is magnificent. A
smaller adjacent room has also been
placed at the disposal of the Com
missioners for their private confer
ences when considering the evidence
that is placed before them or deciding
important questions that, may arise in
the course of their investigations.

SURVIVORS
MARCH OUT
OF CITADEL
Pitiful Procession of
Slav Prisoners
of War.
PORT ARTHUR, Saturday, Jan. 7 â !
Five thousand men of the Russian :
garrison at Port Arthur were marched
from the village of Yahulsui, on the
shores of Pigeon Bay, for fifteen miles !
to the railway station at Changling- j
tzu yesterday. The long procession of 1
the remnant of the gallant Russian
garrison was a pathetic spectacle. The
tirst arrivals at Changlingtzu were j
four droskies, drawn by sorry-looking
horses. They contained the staff of- I
licers who had refused to give their
parole. All wore their swords, as they
were allowed to do under the terms of
the capitulation compact.
A few minutes later the first detach
ment arrived. The regimental officers
marched with their men, their heads
bowed and their faces seamed with
lines showing the result of the mental
and physical strain they had under
gone during the long defense.
As the Japanese soldiers crowded
about them with evident curiosity the
faces of the Russian officers were an
interesting study. All of them ap
peared to feel their humiliating posi
tion keenly, and though some seemed
to be resigned to the situation, others
were resentful as being regarded with
curiosity.
The horses drawing the transport
i aiis were staggering with fatigue,
though the loads were small. They
were tied to the carts and led by
orderlies. In the procession were
many lean looking pet dogs belonging
to the officers.
In many cases officers refused to
wear their swords, but had them car
rteÂ«J behind them by orderlioe. The
officers saluted the European and
American correspondents with the
Japanese army, and appeared to be
both pleased and astonished at seeing
Europeans and Americana there.
The prisoners were treated with the
greatest respect and kindness. The
soldiers were given food, cigarettes and
beer, and the Japanese soldiers were
seen even voluntarily carrying the
effects of the prisoners when they
were overcome by fatigue.
On the evening of January 3, Cap
tain Tsunoda, a Japanese staff of
ficer, was sent to Port Arthur to in
form General Stoessel of the contents
of the message from the Emperor of
Japan to General Nogi. giving instruc
tions that the garrison should be treat
ed with the greatest consideration.
Captain Tsunoda took with him a pres
ent for the Russian commander, con
sisting of chickens and wine.
Stoessel's first inquiry was as to the
whereabouts of General Kuropatkin.
said he had last heard from
Kuuopatkin on October 6. when the
commander of the Manchurian army
said he would soon come to the relief
of Port Arthur. He had, he stated,
sent out Chinese spies, who on their
return reported that Kuropatkin, with
a relieving army, was at Kinchow,
twenty miles to the north of Port Ar
thur. ,
Stoessel listened with evident in
credulity to the statement that Kuro
patkin had been defeated and driven
back toward Mukden, so the captain
produced a map which showed the re
spective positions of the Russian and
Japanese armies near the Shakhe
Kiver. the story of Kuro
patkin's defeat and said that the Rus
sian losses had been between 50,000
and 60.000. Stoessel expressed his
amazement and then quietly remark
ed that he had been misled.
The general asked where the Rus
sian second Pacific squadron was and
was told that some of the ships had
not yet passed the Cape of Good Hope.
With a hopeless expression General
Stoessel s.-'id:
Xotv that Port Arthur has fallen
there is no use of the squadron com
ing farther."
Captain Tsunoda asked what caused
the most damage to the garrison dur
ing the siege, to which General Sto
essel replied:
"Your eleven-inch howitzers. Since
they arrived our defensive works have
been useless."
The general said that he and for
mer Viceroy Alexieff had been
through the Boxer trouble and had
then seen the work of the Japanese
army. He had been associated with
'the Japanese eenerals, Yamagouehi
and Fukushima, at that time, he said,
and he expressed tne opinion that the
Russian and Japanese forces had then
borne the lion's share of the work.
Since that time, he declared, he had
always entertained a high idea of the
organization and fighting qualities of
the Japanese army. The real cause
of the war, in General Stoessel's opin
ion, was the ignorance of the Russian
people regarding the fighting qualities
of the Japanese.
The first attack on Port Aiythur by
the Japanese fleet In February was a
tremendous surprise to the Russians,
General Stoeaael told Captain Tsun
oda, as the forts were then only partly
completed and were garrisoned by
only from 2000 to JO 00 troops.
BALL IN PENSION BUILDING.
House at Last Agrees to Permit Use
of Hall.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.âThe House
to-day adopted the Senate resolution
providing for the holding of the in
augural ball in the Pension building.
On a viva voce vote the resolution was
lost, but a rollcall enabled those fa
vorable to the Pension building propo
sition to muster their strength and
pass it. Speaker Cannon and several
of the Republican leaders recorded
themselves as opposed to the employ
ment of the Pension building for the
purpose of the inaugural ball.
For the third time during the ses
sion the resolution granting temporary'
occupancy of a portion of the District
of Columbia monument lot for an
American railway appliance exhibition
in connection with the meeting of the
International Railway Congress to be
held in this city was called up. Favor
able action on it was previously pre
vented by the opposition of Mann of
Illinois. To-day the resolution was
passed in spite of Mann's objections.

BEEF TRUST

Attorney General Moody for
the Government Argues
the Case Before Supreme
Court of United States
SHOWS AGREEMENT
TO RESTRAIN TRADE
.Maintains the Packers Have
| Manipulated the Price
by Means of \<rents in
All Parts of the Country
. I
WASHINGTON. Jan. 9.âAttorney 1
General Moody to-day concluded his
argument on behalf of the Govern
ment before the Supreme Court of the
United States in the case of Swift &
Co. vs. the United States, commonly
known as the beef trust case, begun
last Friday.
Moody said none of the agreements
acts complained of related to manu
facture or production, but to com
merce. He said the inquiry is nar
rowed down to only two questions for';
the determination of the court:
whether the commerce in the case was
commerce among the States, and if
so, whether the agreements constitute
a monopoly or any part of it. Moody |
maintained that the following had i
been shown:
Personr owning live stock and living in other
States and Terrltoiles than those where the
stockyards are situated were accustomed to
send such stock to the various stockyards
named for the purpose of sale there. The de
fendants, who were severally engaged In the ;
business of buying such live stock for the pur
pose of slaughtering and converting It into
fresh meat, entered into an agreement with I
each other to refrain from bidding against I
each other with the purpose and result of I
suppressing all competition in such purchases. |
The interstate character of the
ti..nsaction, he said, where an owner
â¢of a commodity living in one State
ships it to another, continues from the ,
beginning of the shipment to and in- J
eluding the sale of the commodity* if
It has not lost its identity by the 1
breaking of the original package. In ;
speaking of the packers' contract, j
Moody said:
It creates such a relation between inde
pendent persons as will result In the control- i
ling or limiting of production, the suppression
of competition, either with respect of prices, (
territories or customers, the destruction of
competition of others outside the combination
and the creation by such means of a monopoly
in the mod'-rn sense of the word. Such con
tracts as these, If not universally, have by the
great mat* of authorities been held to be
against public policy and unlawful in the sense
of bÂ«lng unenforcibie between the parties.
Controlling Â»;0 per cent of the fresh meat In
dustry of the whole country, the packers sit
down at their slaughtering and packing estab-.
lishments and. and, with the aid of the tele
graph, through the instrumentality of count
> less agents and attorneys spread throughout
I the country, clothing their transactions and
sheltering their misconduct by ciphers and
secret codes, lower or raise, and when thus
lowered or raised, tlx and maintain absolutely,
as among themselves, the price of every pound
of one of the great necessities of life as it
enters and foUowa, the channels of Interstate
I commerce. This 1s an unlawful restraint of
commerce among the States and was so de
' clared in the Kddystone pipe case, from which
all the ingenuity of counsel cannot distinguish
| the case at bar.
Continuing. Moody said:
From this it appears that the defendants are
all engaged 1n the common effort to obtain un
lawful rates, which they subsequently share or
pool among themselves, and that their scheme
contemplates not only the pocling of these un
lawful rates, but the exclusion of all outside
competlto-s from obtaining them.
No combination can long endure against
those who are secretly and in defiance of the
law en)oying rates for the transportation of
their propesty in interstate commerce which
constitute a preference over all others in the
same business. No more fruitful source of
monopoly can be found than the enjoyment of
preferential rates. The history of the country
demonstrates this.
In pursuance of the ronsplracy among them
selves, their agents bid up the price of live
stock at certain selected times to an abnormal
point. This naturally Induces the shipment
I from other States of live stock to the points
where the price is bid up in quantities much
] larger than under normal conditions. Then.
> taking advantage of this congestion of the
â¢ markets, they refrain from bidding against
each other In the purchase of livestock, with
. the result that the producers and owners of
the stock are forced to sell <,t ruinous prices.
Thus the unlawful conspiracy to refrain from
i bidding against each other is undoubtedly
profitable, and the great profits that will come
from, the transaction In turn increase the power
of the combination and tend to fasten upon the
people a monopoly. The conspiracy In this case
is ancillary to the conspiracy to refrain from
bidding and to the creation of the monopoly
. which this whole case discloses.
In conclusion the Attorney General
argued:
They cannot be permitted to ingenuously sep
arate the various steps of their undertaking
and so deal with them that they cannot be
regarded as interstate transactions. The court
met and answered such a device as this in the
case of Montague k. Co. vs. Lowry. There It
was truly claimed that the sales of unset tiles
In San Francisco by the local dealers were con.
sldered by themselves interstate transactions.
The court held that the sale should be sepa
rated from the main purpose of the comblna
i tion, which was to fix and maintain uniform
; prices for goods which were the subject of
i interstate commerce.
Moody was followed by Miller, who
closed the case for the packers.
Miller took up the charge of re
i bates, and said the facts must be set
up in some way before the court could
take cognizance of them. v
"Suppose," said Judge Harlan, "the
combinations alleged were confined to
domestic commerce in the State of
Illinois, would you consider It a re
straint of trade 1 ?"
Miller replied In the negative.
Justice Harlan asked how It would
be if there was a combination by coal
miners to control the price of coal.
Miller replied that it would largely
depend on the extent of the combina
: tion and also upon whether there were
< State anti-trust laws. Taking up an
other line, he said no commerce be
tween the States was involved.
Justice White asked a question as
to the effect of an agreement to fix
i the price of meat In another State,
i but Miller contended that the charge
'in the pending case did not go so far
as that.
TRUST AGENTS RELEASED.

Eves of All
Germany on
Boy of Seven
GRANDSON OF IRON CHANCETLr-
LOH, WHOSE DEVELOPMENT
GERMANS ARE WATCHING.
BERLIN, Jan. 9.âThe eyes of the
entire nation have been turned upon the
heir of the house of Bismarck, for since
the death of his father 7-year-old Otto
yon Bismarck is the oldest male mem
ber of the family. It is said of him
that he bears the proudest name in
modern German historyâthat of his
grandfather, the Fatherland's empire
builder and "Iron Chancellor." Born in
September, 1897, little Prince Otto al
ready gives promise of perpetuating the
mental and physical traits of his great
ancestor, whose name he is the first of
I his line to bear.
' Under the fond guidance of his hand
some and vivacious mother, who was
the Hungarian Countess Hoyos when
she married Prince Herbert Bismarck
in 1871, Prince Otto is growing into a
manly fellow, and even at this early
period of his life has developed traces
of the characteristics which carved his
family name so indelibly in the world's
history. He is a big boy for his age
and Is passionately fond of vigorous
sport, especially horseback riding, at
which he is an adept. He speaks Ger
man, English and French fluently, and
is an extremely handsome little gentle
man. His type is more American in its
aspect than either German or Hun
garian.
Prince Otto is getting his schooling
from home tutors, but when he is old
enough he will be sent to the "gymna
sium"âthe German equivalent for the
American college preparatory schoolâ
and when he attains university age he
will be entered at a student at Bonn,
the classic university on the Rhine,
where his father was a classmate of
Emperor William II and where the,
Hohenzollern Princes and all the noble
boys of Germany get their university
training.
Then, so his mother Intends, Prince
Otto shall still further adhere to fam
ily traditions by joining the army, al
though It has not yet been fully deter
mined that he will make a military ca
reer his life work. His father, like his
grandfather, won fame in diplomacy,
and the little Prince may eventually
decide to serve his Fatherland In the
realmlof politics too.
Prince Otto has two sisters older than
himself, the Countesses Hannah and
Maria, and two younger brothers.
Counts Gottfried and Albreoht. The
family lives amid Ideal surroundings on
the old and beautiful Bismarck estate
at Friedrichsruhe-Schoenhausen. The
Princess Bismarck Inherited extensive
and valuable landed properties from
her late husband and father-in-law
and is In position to keep up a mag
nificent social establishment, but since
the relations between the Iron Chancel
lor and the present Kaiser were broken
off none of the Bismarck family has
sought to participate actively In court
life or noble society.

Booth is a brother of the principal

CLARK IN LAND CASES.
Senator the Purchaser of Vast Tract
Connected With Frauds.
HELENA. Mont., Jan. 9.âJudge Wil
liam K. Hunt in the Uniter States Court
here to-day overruled the demurrers
of the defendants to the indictments in
the cases of the United States against
R. B. Cobham. J. B. Cattlin and many
others, charged with subornation of
perjury and perjury in connection with
timber land entries in Western Mon
tana, and the accused will now have to
come to trial. There are twelve indict
ments for subornation of perjury and
ninety for perjury.
Included among the defendants are
many settlers in Powell and Missoula
counties, who are alleged to have made
false oaths in proving up on their tim
ber lands, which were afterward ac
quired by Senator W. A. Clark. It is
c harged that Cobham and Cattlin, well
known citizens of Missoula, induced
these people to swear falsely. The in
dictments were returned in June, 1901.
and the cases have since been pending
in court.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.âThe follow
ing authoritative statement was made
to-night:
In the spring of lf>o2 the Interior Department
wa<= informed that extensive land frauds were
being perpetrated in Montana and Idaho-under
an act of Congress known as the timber and
stone act. Secretary Hitchcock immediately
eet on foot an investigation, and in the State
of Montana it was discovered that at the Land
Offices of Helena *nd Missoula many fradu
lent entries had been made. It was soon dis
covered, it is alleged, that under the leader
ship of R. B. Cobham a conspiracy was or
ganized and a lot of people living in the vicin
ity of Missoula âmen and womenâwere direct
ed to make applications at the Land Office.
Under the act of Congress it wu necessary
for the applicant, when he made his applica
tion, to take an oath that the land was not
taken for speculative purposes, but for his own
use, and that no one else was directly or in
directly interested in the purchase.
Cobham and his associates prepared all those
affidavits and paid all expenses and $2 50 an
acre for the land, and gave these persons from
$100 to $150 apiece for fnlse swearing and
entry. There v.ere 102 perrons, men and
women, indicted and a number of indictments
were filedâCobham being indicted some ten
times. These Indictments were for perjury and
forgery'- A!! landr. amounting to some
15.000 acres, were sold by Cobham to United
States Senator W. A. Clark. Demurrers *ere
filed to these indictments and they have, been
delayed from time to time until now. To-day
the Attorney General received the following
telegram from United States Special Attorney
Maynard. dated a" Helena. January 8:
"Judge Hunt overruled demurrer in twelve
subornation perjury cases and ninety perjury
cases. Having exhausted all dilatory pleas,
defendants must now stand trial."

RUMOR FALSE

Proposal to Transfer Navy
Yard to a New Location
Is Not Being Considered
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL. BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â"lt is no
more true to-day than it has been for
several years that the Government in
tends to abandon the Mare Island
Navy Yard," said Rear Admiral En
dlcott, chief of the bureau of docks
and yards, when a newspaper story
to this time-worn effect was called to
his attention to-day.
But then he qualified it, saying:
I mean by that that there Is no intention
to take action in the matter pending- the ef
forts now being made to make a good and
permanent channel in Mare Island Straits.
A large sum of money has been expended in
dredging the channel and still there Is a call
for more every year and every year there Is
enough impatient questioning by the House
Committee to start this story on its rounds.
I was before the committee the other day and
while explaining the situation there a member
"Is It not time to take the bull by the horns
and abandon Mare Island as a navy yard and
secure a location in San Francisco Bay, where
we will have permanent deep water?"
I did not agree with him. We spent last
year $100,000 on the channel and this year
$150,000. We are asking for $100,000 for next
year. We ere making improvements in the
"channel that we hope will effect a permanent
cure by quickening the current so that the
silt will be carried through the straits. A
million already spent is not to be lightly
thrown away, though there Is also wisdom
in the old advice against throwing good money
after bad.
I believe, however, that the expenditure of
the money we are asking for this year will be
sufficient and the problem will be solved. If
not we will then be forced to see It a new
location. In that case we would find It in
San Francisco Bay, somewhere where we
would have deep water. The contingency, how
ever Is not worth talking of at this time, for
the reasons I have given.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Jan. 9.âEngineers in the

Railroad Company are setting grade
stakes between Durango, Colorado,
and Farmington, N. M., which shows
that Gould will enter Into competition
with the Santa Fe Central, the South
ern Pacific and other roads in build

and will Invade Southern Pacific ter

open up the greatest agricultural re
gion in Northern New Mexico, which
is reported by experts to be one of
the finest in the world.
General Superintendent William
Coughlln of the Rio Grande Railroad
Company, with headquarters in this
city, does not deny the report that
the Rio Grande intends building such
a road. He admits that engineers are
working for the company at the point
mentioned and expresses the opinion
that the construction of a road be
tween Durango and Farmlngton would
be a. paying investment.
It is an opinion freely expressed in
railroad circles that, now that the
Rio Grande has become active in this
section, it will be the first to complete
a line. The Santa Fe and Southern
Pacific companies have contemplated
building roads in the same territory
and have made no effort to conceal
their intentions or their preliminary
work In the district. The latter road
has gone so far as to complete a sur
vey and take up estimates with con
tractors for the laying of the track.

NEW YORK, Jan. 9. âA tale of re

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
COUNCIL IS READY TO CALL
THE BOND ELECTION.
Vote on Bay Citaes 9 Plan
Councilman Howard Urges the Pur
chase of Company's Plant.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 9.
The City Council to-night, after pro
tracted debate, adopted by unanimous
vote, Councilman McAdam being ab
sent, resolutions ordering the prepara
tion of an ordinance calling a bond
election for the submission of the Bay
Cities Water Company's project to sell
the city a municipal water supply.
Councilman John L. Howard read a
long paper, in which he favored making
an effort at once to get the Contra
( nsta Water Company to submit a fiat
offer to sell or within ninety days to
agree to an arbitration upon the value
of its plant if the sale figures should
not satisfy the Council. Howard strong
ly favored the purchase of the Contra
Costa plant, but said he was not in ac
cord with the company's methods of
finding a valuation. He opposed lt3
proposition to submit to a condemna
tion suit, saying that this wodld lead
to interminable litigation. Touching the
Bay Cities project as presented, Coun
cilman Howard said:
"I believe the Bay Cities Company
makes its offer in good faith, but I
am unwilling to vote to assume the
risk of tying up the city's partial pay
ments to the extent of perhaps 75 per
< ent of $3,750,000, awaiting the prob
lematical issue of litigation, which the
company's attorney is frank enough to
hay he expects.
"Unless steps are immediately taken
to change existing conditions I will
favor a contract binding the city to

ADVERTISEMENTS.
HE HAD FAITH
And It Was Justified.
"In reply to your letter of recent date
will say that I am cured as sound as a
dollar. I used about three of the fifty-'
cent packages. I was going to write
you, but was holding up to see If the
plies would give me any further
trouble. I feel no signs of the piles
and believe I am cured entirely. I had
faith in Pyramid Pile Cure at the start
end stuck right to the treatment. You
can refer any one to me you like. I
can soon tell what Pyramid Pile Cure
has done for me. Washing you much
success I remain, J. C. Kinkaid, Mgr
lor Fleischman & Co., agency at Knox
ville, Term."
It is a well reoggnlzed fact that the
best advertising In article can have is
that which is known as "word of
mouth"; this rightfully carries more
weight than an the claims which can
be set forth. It follows that Mr. Kin
kaid, with his wide acquaintance, will
largely promote the sale and use of
Pyramid Pile Cure becauseâand here
is the vital pointâhe knows whereof
he speaks and not only advocates Its
use but does so with enthusiasm; this
It not to be wondered at, and in point
ni fact can any one, after reading his
letter, doubt that this remedy cures?
Pyramid Pile Cure is sold by drug
gists for the low price of fifty cents a
package; it is in suppository form, is
applied directly to the parts affected
und does its work quickly and pain
lessly; there is no other remedy "just
as good."

when it is completed and ready to turn
over free and clear. Further, in recog
nition of the practice of making pro
gress payments, I would agree to allow
them interest on such progress pay
ments as would be made by the city if
the proposition itself were free from
the serious attack that is admitted to
be Impending.
"I am willing to vote, both as an offi
cial and a citizen, for any safe business
proposition that will give the city an
assured supply of water and thus re
lieve the tension of the public mind.
Let the Bay Cities Company in some
way compose its difficulties with ad
verse claimants, or so assert Its rights
that its decks will be cleared, and then
come to us with a proposal that is free
from doubt and safe from attack, that
will give water and not the possibility
of delay or the certainty of litigation.
We want both water and peace because
we are sick of strife."
Howard said he voted for the resolu
tions with reservation. Councilmen
Dornin, Elliott and Pendleton said they
believed the time past for arbitration;
that the citizens had called for the sub
mission of the Bay Cities plan. Attor
ney R. M. Fitzgerald for the Bay Cities
Company declared that if the bonds*
carried the company would pay the
cost of the election if the City Attorney
should not pass favorably upon its
titles to watersheds and rights. City
Engineer Turner submitted an approx
imate cost of the plant at $3,750,000 and
the distributing system $1,950,000, total
$5,700,000.

EVIDENCE IS WEAK
Inquisitors Informed That
It Would Be Useless to
Indict Four Ex-Policemen
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 9.
The new Grand Jury held its first ses
, sion this morning and has begun the
i work laid out for it. District Attorney
! Allen and Judge S. P. Hall were before
'it in regard to the recent police scan- j
dal, and the matter of taking any ac-
I tion is still under advisement. In his
â¢ address to the jury upon its impanel- !
! ment Judge Hall called attention to the j
i published accounts of the police scan
> dal and said that it was a proper sub- i
' Ject for investigation.
The District Attorney is of the opin- J
ion that if indictments are found no
prosecution would be successful, as the |
only evidence against Sergeant Clark i
! and Policemen Stahl, Hamerton and
Andrews is their own confessions, given
under promise of immunity from prose- I
cution in consideration of their hand- i
ing in their resignations to the Chief of â¢
Police and the threat that if they did
not the entire matter - would be pub
lished. Such a confession could not be
introduced as evidence, and there is no
other evidence against them.
The thefts charged against the police
men were done in such a way that the
owners of the stores themselves were
not aware In many instances that any
thing had been taken until the confes
sions were made public, and so far no
witnesses have been found willing to
go before the Grand Jury and make
complaint.
The matter of appointing an expert
to investigate the accounts of the coun
ty offices was laid over until the next
meeting, which will be held next Tues
day.

Down Mother-in-Law and
Takes Away Child by Force
CROWD SEES STRUGGLE
Divorce Proceedings Pend
ing Between the Parents
and Father Had Kept Boy
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 9.
Without waiting for a process of the
law to give her custody of her two
year-old son, Mrs. Cecelia Klllian took
the Infant away from her mother-in
law, Mrs. Rose Killian, on a public
thoroughfare this afternoon. The elder
Mrs. Killian was about to board an
Eighth street car at Broadway when
she was fiercely attacked by the mother
of the child and knocked down. In the
struggle which ensued, and which was
witnessed by many people, both women
lost their hats and were generally
tousled.
There is a divorce suit pending be
tween the young Mrs. Killian and her
husband. During the the
proceedings the mother-in-law has had
the custody of the child. The mother
has been waiting just such an oppor
tunity to get her child as was presented
this afternoon. She fought like a tigress.
She was accompanied by her father,
John Madden, who stood a passive
spectator of the struggle between the
two women, allowing his daughter to
take her own. He accompanied her up
the street after she had taken the
child, and said that his daughter's hus
band was a habitual drunkard and that
she was suing him for a divorce upon
that ground.

OAKLAND, Jan. 9.âA birthday Is always
an important event In the life of every child,
and until one's teens are reached birthdays

made merry and enjoyed the Impromptu pro
gramme of fancy dances and songs rendered
by several clever little ones. To the delight
of every one Kendall Fellows and Elmer Booth,
the latter the children's matinee Idol just now,
were Miss Ftoele'a guests. Mr. Kendall told
some of his inimitable Chinese stories, with his
audience crowded closely and eagerly about
him.
At a late hour the little hostess led the way
to the lower hall, where the real "party" be
gan, for there, on tables glowing with red
lights and flowers, were all the "goodies" that
apreal most to the inner Juvenile. The round
table, over which the bonnie little hostess pre
sided, was exquisitely decorated. A cloud of
red tulle occupied the center of the table, from
the midst of which rose a tall cutglass vase
filled with potnsettlas.
Altogether the day was one that will long

MORRIS ISSUES
NEW CIRCULAR
Director and Former Cashier
of Central Bank Fires Sec
ond Gun in His Attack
SCORES VICE PRESIDENT
Charge of Forgery and Fraud
Is Made Against Officer
of Important Institution
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 9.
The second gun in the fight among
| the stockholders of the Central Bank
was fire dto-night when S. H. Morris,
the - recently retired cashier and a
director of that institution, issued an
other circular to the stockholders of
the bank. Morris was for a while cash
ier of the bank, and after his retire
ment from that office he remained as a
director. He is still one of the largest
stockholders, if not the largest single
stockholder. In the big financial con
j cern, but he is fighting the manage
ment.
He fired the first gun two weeks ago,
when he issued a circular that stirred
Oakland to its financial center. The
stockholders of the bank answered his
circular by meeting and removing him
; from office as a director. Now Morris
has mailed to every stockholder in the
bank a circular letter that is bitter to
the last degree against W. G. Palman
teer, the vice president and general
manager of the bank. The charge of
forgery that Is made against Palman
teer In this circular has been inves
tigated by the directors of the bank,
and Thomas Crellin, the president of
the Institution, is the authority for the
statement that it has been thoroughly
inquired into and disapproved. The
majority of the stockholders are with
Palmanteer in this fight, but Morris,
who holds the largest single block of
stock, still keeps up the fight In his
circulars. The latest circular issued by
Morris Is as follows:,
OAKLAND, Cal.. Jan. 8.
To the stockholders of Central Bank: I was
director In the Central Bank for several years,
and at the last annual meeting of the stock
holders I was turned out by the use of forged
and fraudulent votes. I was naturally very
indignant when I discovered that W. G. Pal
manteer was the perpetrator of these unlaw
ful and dastardly crimes. I now denounce
and charge W. G. Palmanteer with willful
and deliberate forgery in connection with the
affairs of the Central Bank.
I further charge him with manipulating and
using forged and fraudulent proxies at the
annual meeting of stockholders held In March
last, and with the further Iniquity of falsify
ing the records of the Central Bank. Forgery
is the criminal's most potent weapon. The pen
in the hands of a forger (though at times it
may only make an X) Is more feared than any
competitors, and It requires eternal vigi
lance to guard ourselves from Its secret and
dangerous attacks.
A bank officer's reputation for honesty. In
tegrity and business probity should of all In
dividuals be above reproach. When he Jug
gles with the affairs of the bank and violates
the laws of the State, when he resorts to for
gery, ballot stuffing, falsification of records,
intrigue and other reprehensible practices that
if known would bring ruin and disaster In
their wake, it is time for the stockholders of
this bank who possess the old-fashioned
standard of business morality to take such
steps as will safeguard the interest' of the de
positors and patrons of this Institution. The
retention of a forger at the head of this insti
tution Â«fter the exposure of his unlawful and
dangerous practices will be a constant re
proach and menace to the prosperity and safety
of this bank.
What I ask and desire is that the stock
holders of this institution attend In person
the annual meeting to be held January 10, 1905,
and after learning the exact state of affairs
take such action as Is necessary to purge the
Institution of the criminal element; eliminate
all taint of wrongdoing and erect on the ruins
of forgery, fraud and corruption a standard
of honesty, probity and Integrity unsullied
by the taint of crime and uncontamlnated by
any act of trickery or deceit.

SAYS CHARGES
ARE UNFOUNDED
Oakland City Council Exon
erates Associated Chari
ties From Accusations
IS WORTHY INSTITUTION
Funds Have All Been Ex
pended in Right Manner
and Investigation Is Made
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
1016 Broadway, Jan. 9.
The City Council to-night dismissed j
the charges filed by Mrs. Agnes Burke
Sheppard against the Associated Char- ,
Ities and fully exonerated the officials
of the organisation. The charges of
Mrs. Sheppard were declared to be en- j
tirely without foundation and unworthy
of further consideration.
The Auditing and Finance Committee
of the Council, by which the charges j
against the Associated Charities were j
investigated, submitted the following
report this evening:
The undersigned members of the Auditing
and Finance Committee visited the rooms of
the Associated Charities in order to examine
into the system pursued by that beneficiary
of the city. i
We found that the president of the assocla- i
tion is B. H. Pendleton, a member of this [
Council. Hia associates are Rev. Charles R. i
Brown, Rev. Charles W. Walkley and John D. I
Isaacs. This fact in itself warrants the be
lief in a conscientious supervision of the so
ciety's affairs.
That the secretary and the executive of the
association Is Miss Anita C. Whitney, a re
fined lady of manifest executive ability.
That receipts *nd warrants are Issued for
all sums received and expended and that from
the stubs of such books debit and credit en
tries are made in a cash book. This cash book
Is checked in detail at the end of each three
months by D. Edward Collins, a member of
the association, whose certificate of correct
ness appears on such said cash book. Owing
to this fact the committee did not make a
detailed audit..
That for the character of the work Intended
to be done by the society, the system pursued
commends itself to us and that the society
itself is a praiseworthy enterprise.
That the attack upon the society, which
was the cause of our visit, is entirely unwar
ranted, apparently personal In character and
with the manifest motive of seeking notoriety.
In our Judgment it is entirely unworthy of
further attention by us.

First District were 10,543,743 gallons,
and for the Fourth 2.580.195. Ft
some years it has been consider !
that ten million gallons made a big
showing, but the former comes to 1904

to the Board of Supervisors saying he
will be glad to assist in procuring an

to the question of refunding taxes

Iwlll give it careful consideration. In
the meantime the resolutions memo
rializing the Legislature to pass the
amendments will be submitted to the
Assembly. Prescott says:
..Secretary H. A. Mason of the League of
Municipalities has received a number of com
munications in reply to requests from city
officials and others stating that they are in
â¢ favor of the amendment to permit banks to
act as city depositories. Among these arc

this, city and Attorney General Webb will

Inventor Loses Suit.
J,\ Judge Seawell yesterday decided for
the defendant in the suit of Bernard
\v. Augustine against the Augustine
,!Ma nurturing and Graining Com
pany, Thomas W. Gardiner and others.
The plaintiff, an inventor, sold the
â¢California rights to his patent grain
ing machine to the defendants under
an', agreement that they should pay
him' $5000 and a salary of $75 a
.month. Payments of $2020 were made
'"before a lapse and he sued to set aside
. frhe > pntract. The defense pleaded that
â b* had given extensions of time on the
payments and had broken the contract
,;â¢ in failing to deposit in escrow a writ-
description of the secret ingredi
ents of the material used with the ma
-4 h-ine and instructions for its manu
facture.
Says They Were Incompetent.
. The Fiseher-Rebmann Theater Com
pany yesterday answered two of the
â Bits of the footlight personages who
â¢demanded damages for breaches of
â¢ Iheir contracts last spring. To Helen
â¢Russell's claim for $1800, the company
replies that she resigned voluntarily
and furthermore that she had been
found incompetent, and the right un
der the contract to give a two weeks'
'notice of its termination had been ex
ercised. The company also claims a
[release in writing from any liability
â¢for further demands. A like answer
Is. made to the suit of John P. Ken

DOAX'S PILLS.
I] j CITIZEn'S STORY i
..Told, bj a San Francisco Citizen fo

â The greatest importance attached
..to the following is that it concerns
a. San Francisco citizen. It would
lose three-quarters of its interest if
.it: involved some resident of Kala

Like all the testimony which has ap
peared here, and like all which will
follow about the Old Quaker rem
.edy, Doan's Kidney Piils, it comes
â from residents, fellow citizens and
'.neighbors. No other remedy can
show such a record of home cures.
â¢R : ead this case:
â¢ -Louis Sanquinetti. huckster, of
:I3io Dupont street, says: "I was so
"crippled with pain in my backâin fact
, I.was laid up with itâthat I could not
attend to my work, when Doan's
Kidney Pills came to my notice and I
took a course of the treatment. Pre
vious to that I had exhausted my
'. knowledge of known remedies gath
ered from reading and prescribed by
'my friends. Some recommended this
and some recommended that. I took
.â¢Doan's Kidney Pills as I had taken
'other preparations in the past, with
. very little expectation of receiving
'any results, and I must confess I was
â¢ more than surprised when the aching
iij my back stopped. That is six
: m.onths ago, and it has not returned.
I honestly recommend Doan's Kidney
Tills to others, so that they may
know about a preparation upon which
they cap. depend."

by the Mayor's wishes he will also iake
his seat on the board. Commissioner
Maestretti has been decided upon for
the presidency of the board for the en
suing year.
Fire Commissioner Henry M. Wreden,
who is ill, will take his oath of office as
soon as he is able. Because of his ab
sence the Fire Commission held no
meeting.
The Police Commission will meet this
evening to seat Dr. Poheim, the new
member, who in all likelihood will be
elected president of the board.
The Mayor made no announcement as
to his appointments to the vacancy on
the Health Board and that on the Park
Commission. William H. Metson seems
to be the only one mentioned for the
latter place.
It has now been definitely settled that
Alexander O'Grady will not accept the
secretaryship cf the Police Commis
sion. Morris Levy, secretary of the
Board of Works, will shortly carry out
his intention, decided upon several
months ago, to resign the place in or
der to devote his entire time to other
and more profitable interests. It is on
the cards that Secretary James de
Succa of the Park Commission will suc
ceed Levy and that Herbert Schmltz,
ex-Commissioner of Works, will resume
his old position as secretary of the
Park Commission. It is said that a deal
is on involving the shifting of several
officials, but it will not come for sev
eral days yet.

WORK ON NEW
LINE DELAYED
Supervisors Defer Action on
the Permit to Electrize
California Street Road
PASS ROOF-REPAIR BILL
Ordinance Requires That
Fireproof Material Shall Be
Utilized in a District
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
postponed action for one week on the
resolutions granting the United Rail
roads permission to use electric mo
tive power on that portion of the
steam road on California street from
Parker to First avenue. The franchise
for the rest of the road already per
mits the use of electricity thereon.
Supervisor Boxton urged that ac
tion be postponed, saying that the
privilege was In the nature of a new
franchise. Braunhart explained that
the privilege simply gave the United
Railroads the right to use electricity
instead of steam on two and a half
blocks where it has now no such
right.
E. P. E. Troy filed a communication,
which was referred to the Street Com
mittee, asking that the following con
ditions be imposed on the United
Railroads in return for the privilege:
That cars shall be operated in an eas
terly and westerly direction to each
terminus at intervals of not less than
five minutes; that each car shall be
equipped with air brakes and emer
gency hand brakes; that mail car
riers, members of the Police and Fire
departments shall ride free; that all
machinery, iron, cars and other ma
terial used in the construction and
operation of the road shall be of Cali
fornia manufacture, except when the
same cannot be made here; that
the grooved rail shall be used
throughout; that, as provided in the
charter for new franchises, all the
roadway and street equipment shall
revert to the city at the expiration of
the franchise; and that ornamental
iron poles shall be used.
The United Railroads obtained a
permit to explode blasts for grading
purposes along the right of way
through the Sutro estate property
bounded by Thirty-third avenue, Pa
cific Ocean shore line. Forty-eighth
avenue and by the notherly boundary
of the city cemetery.
The ordinance regulating the con
struction of fireproof roofs and the re
pair of roofs within certain limits* so
that if they are destroyed fireproof
material only shall be used in their
reconstruction, was finally passed.
Little interest was manifested in the
measure, some of the Supervisors not
taking the trouble to answer their
names, though they were marked as
voting in favor of it.
The proposed ordinance prohibiting
the keeping of swine within the city
limits was recommitted to the Health
Committee owing to a clerical error
in the draft. A petition was filed by
the Santa Fe Railway Company that
the bill be amended so as to permit
the loading and unloading of cattle
and swine at the Union Stockyards.
The bill fixing widths of sidewalks
on Lincoln street was passed to print.
The grades on the. street were ordered
changed. Preliminary steps for the
improvement of Fulton street were
taken by the adoption of a resolution
changing the grades on the thorough
fare from Twenty-sixth to Thirty
sixth avenues.
Grades were ordered changed on
Forty-sixth, Forty-seventh and Forty
eighth avenues.
A demand for $650 was drawn in
favor of J. H. Dockweiler for expert
services.
The width of sidewalks on Lake
street, from First avenue westerly,
was fixed at fifteen feet.
BALLINGER ARRESTED ON
GRAND JURY INDICTMENT
Accused of Felony Embezzlement
While Bookkeeper for the Cali
fornia Art Glass Works.
George T. Ballinger, indicted by the
Grand Jury on a charge of felony em
bezzlement, was arrested by Detec
tives Dlnan and Wren yesterday on a
bench warrant arid booked at the City
Prison. He was at once released on
$2000 bonds, his sureties being Mat
thew Nunan of the Hibernia Brewery
and Colonel Thomas F. Barry. The
case has been assigned by Presiding
Judge Lawlor to Judge Dunne's court.
Ballinger was bookkeeper for the
California Art Glass Bending and
Cutting Works, 120 Second street, and
was arrested in March, 1904, on com
plaint of William Schroeder, president
of the company, on a charge of felony
embezzlement, the amount alleged in
the complaint being $392.
On May 9 an application was made
before Judge Graham for a writ of
habeas corpus for Balllrfger's release.
The writ was granted and the prison
er discharged. When the case came
up for trial In Judge Dunne's court
the Judge ignored the action of Judge
Graham and insisted upon its going to
trial against the vigorous protests of
Balllnger's counsel. The case did not
go to trial, however, the District At
torney having decided to take the
matter before the Grand Jury.

Majority of Joint Committee
Recommends Distribution
of Horse Shoeing Contracts
GRAY'S BILLS ARE CUT
Supervisors Believe Eight
"Dollars a Day Is Enough
for a Sweeping Machine
The Supervisors' Joint Committee on
Police, Health and Electricity met
yesterday to consider a proposed reso
lution favored by a majority of the
committee awarding contracts to six
bidders for shoeing horses of various
city departments which the three
committees control. The resolution
divided up the work by awarding con
tracts to M. McNeil, Nick Morrissey, J.
F. Farxell, J. F. Mooney and Norris
& Lynch at $2 50 for shoeing and $1 50
for rubber pads and to Ed Toy at
$2 25 for shoeing and $125 for pads.
Supervisors Boxton and Rock desired
to know why Edward Graney, who
had also put In a bid, did not get part
of the work. D'Ancona replied that It
was the opinion of a majority of the
committee that Graney had received
more than his share of the city's work
in the past and that it was time for
him to defer to others. At this point
the further consideration of the awards
was postponed until next Monday at
2 o'clock.
The Finance Committee cut down
the bills of Gray Brothers for the
rental of street sweeping machines
from $2812 51 to $2093 26. The firm
asked $12 per day for each of three
machines. The committee agreed that
$8 would be a fair charge and ordered
the bills paid as reduced.
The Board of Supervisors adopted
a resolution directing the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company and
other corporations furnishing gas and
electricity to file before January 31
the usual annual statements showing
their revenue from all sources, the ex
penditures made, the original cost and
estimated present value of the plants,
amount of capital stock, bonds and
floating debt of the companies prepar
atory to fixing the lighting rates.
The proposed resolution granting
permits to various hospitals and sani
tariums went over for one week, owing
to a protest having been filed against:
one of the hospitals to be established
by Drs. Harvey and Hunsaker at 2117
California street.
City Attorney Long advised the
board that resolutions be so amended
as to authorize him to permit judg
ments In greater amounts than those
obtained by the Pacific Coast Com
pany, J. D. Spreckels & Brothers Com
pany and Hyman Brothers, whose at
torneys have satisfactorily convinced
Long of the validity of the larger
claims.
The City Attorney advised the board
that the resolution accepting Pierce
street between McAllister and Golden
Hate avenue before a sewer was laia
in the block was void and that the
city was not liable for the cost of the
sewer since constructed, which was
assessed by the Hoard of Works to the
property owners.
Consideration of the Mayor's veto
of the proposed amended ordinance
permitting the reconstruction of
stables on existing sites without the
consent of surrounding property own
ers was deferred one week.
WIDOW OF WINEMAKER
TELLS OF HER COURTSHIP
Mrs. Monnier Married at Sixteen and
Lived Under Old "Melodian"
Music Hall.
The attorneys for George Monnier
Jr. devoted yesterday to a further
cross-examination of Mrs. Anna Mon
nier in an effort to trap her into con
tradictions of her deposition taken in
the will contest. In instances where
discrepancies were brought out the
widow explained that the reporter had
made a mistake in rendering her evi
dence or she had refreshed her
memory.
Among other things she told the
stcry of her courtship and marriage
with George Monnier nearly a .half
Century ago. She was only sixteen,
she said, and she met him on a street
car going to a then popular resort in
the Mission. Four months later they
were married. He was interested in
the "Melodian," an old-time music hall,
and took tickets at the door. Their
living rooms were beneath the hall.
Mrs. Monnier was questioned as to the
circumstances surrounding the making
of her will and that of Monnier. She
said that since his death she had made
another will, because she was afraid
she was going to be killed. In the lat
ter testament she has provided for
George Monnier's daughter, "so she
will have something to be raised on."
JURY BEING IMPANELED
FOR GEBER MURDER TRIAL
Plea of Insanity Will Bo Made for
Man Who Shot and Killed Charles
and George Hartmann.
A jury is being impaneled in Judge
Dunne's court to try August Geber on
a charge of murder. From the ques
tions put to the jurors it is evident
that the defense will depend upon a
plea of insanity. Eleven jurors were
accepted yesterday, their names being
J. T. Hunter, C. Daly. C. P. Wright,
P. H. Fleming, Robert Haight, Louis
Schneider, Frank Mousley, Edward
Case, F. E. Strohman. August Brown
ing and Raoul Chartrey.
Geber had been employed by
George Hartmann, painter, 321 Third
street, and boarded at the house. On
Sunday morning, July 10, he objected
to the food, prepared for his breakfast
and Hartmann discharged him. Ge- j
ber went upstairs to his bedroom, <
armed himself and shot two of Hart- j
mann'-s sons. He also attempted to
shoot Hartmann and his wife, but was j
overpowered by Policeman Jerome H.
Tyrrell. For his bravery Tyrrell was
presented with a gold medal at the
annual inspection of the Police De
partment last October.

YORKE WANTS
DEMANDS PAID
Company Says It Will Not
Repair Pavements Until

IN REPLY TO SCHMITZ
Finance Committee Issues
Statement Showing Money
Allowed for Street Paving
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday again considered the resolu
tion authorizing the payment of $3727
to F. M. Yorke & Co. for repairs to
bituminous pavements, the bills for
which have been held up because the
company refused to continue the
work. Alexander O'Grady, attorney
for the company, said the repairs
would be resumed only on condition
that the bills of the company, amount
ing to $14,000, be paid by the city.
"The company is unable to carry
out its contract," said O'Grady, "be
cause it has no means to do so. Things
appear to be in such a hopeless condi
tion that we do not know where we
stand."
The committee replied that it had
imposed a condition that repairs
should be proceeded with before the
September bill would be paid. D'An
cona,said that the September bill and
all subsequent demands would be paid
if the contractors would go ahead
with the work according to the speci
fications and file daily records of the
measurements of the areas repaired.
O'Grady agreed to confer again with
his clients.
The petition of the Mission clubs
that the Southern Pacific Company's
bridge at Mount Vernon and San Jose
avenues and the approaches thereto
be put in good condition was referred
to the Street Committee.
The Finance Committee submitted
to the board a reply to a statement
made by Herbert Schmltz, the retiring
president of the Board of Works, giv
ing as his reason for resigning that
the Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors had not allowed suf
ficient money to keep the city thor
oughfares in shape. The committee's
statement contains figures showing
that the committee recommended
$109,000 for repairs to streets for
1904-1905, or an increase of $JO,
--822 07 above the amount allowed in
1903-04. In new construction of
streets during 1903-04 the Works
Board allowed $69,442, while during
the present fiscal year, when the seg
regation of the funds has been made
by the Board of Supervisors, the al
lowance is $220,000, or an Increase of
$150,553. The statement says:
For the fiscal year 1903-1904 the Board of
Supervisors appropriated for the use of the
Board of Public Works $416,720. the Beard of
Public Works being allowed to subdivide this
fund as It might deem best. During said fiscal
year the Board of Public Works expended In
the repair of streets paved with bituminous
rock and asphalt. $22,964 37: basalt block and
cobbles. $57,183 09; street and water front,
$1308 M; county roads, $8746 0-1; San Bruno
road, $6496 45; extra amount taken from re
serve fund. $1429 17: total. $98,177 93.
In the preparation of the budget of the
present fiscal year, in order to prevent the
diversion of the funds from the purposes In

A committee from the California

the committee in support of its peti
tion that its -members and mediums

CITY MAY LOSE
A CONVENTION
Christian Church Ministers
and Railroad Companies
at Variance as to Rates
The International Convention of the
Christian Church, which has been
given to San Francisco for August next
year may be called off and given to
some city in the East. The Rev. Wal
ter M. White, D. D., reported to the
Christian Church Ministers' Associa
tion that they had not been able to set
tle on a rate with the Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe companies, which might
be the cause of the convention s going
to another city.
Dean Van Kirk, D. D.. and Professor
McAneney, president of the Berkeley
Bible Seminary, the Rev. P. C. Macfar
lar.e and the Rev. Mr. Berry took part
In the discussion, with the result that
it was resolved to draw up a letter to
thÂ» railroad companies setting forth
the desire of the committees as to a
rate. This must be decided upon on or
before Monday, January 16.
The letter says that at the last con
vention, held in St. Louis, there were
20,274 delegates and that under favora
ble circumstances the convention held
In this city will attract not less than
8000 to 10,000. It says, further, that at
a meeting of the Ministerial Associa
tion it was unanimously agreed that
unless they be assured of railroad rates
from Eastern points to San Francisco
at least as low as those to Portland for
the Lewis and Clark Exposition they
will be compelled to surrender their
rights to the convention, referring the
matter of the place of the next conven
tion to the American Christian Mis
sionary Society of Cincinnati.
Dr. White said that at the convention
at St. Louis there was a verbal assur
ance made by the representatives of
the two companies that the convention
could have as low a rate to San Fran
cisco as was given Portland this year,
but since that time the committee had
been informed that the assurance was
given without authority. The rate to
the Portland Exposition Is $45 from the
Missouri River, $52 50 from St. Louis
and $56 from Chicago. The rate offered
the Christian Church, said the doctor,
is $62 50 from Chicago, which is consid
ered too high, and in view of that fact
it would not be considered advisable to
hold the convention in San Francisco.

I BUCATION OFFIOTr~~7.TT.TTHIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
: I E.SDAY 10, 1905
A MEASURE relating to child labor is before the Legislature.
It proposes an age limit on child labor, which is fixed we be
lieve at 14 years. There is no room for discussion of the dele
terious effects upon the race of certain forms of child labor. Under
ground and mill work are unfit for children. Constant employment
indoors at any kind of labor in the early teens is injurious. Indeed,
in some cases, indoor occupation*in school five days of the week
during nine months of the year is harmful.
What is needed for the wholesome and symmetrical develop
ment, physical, moral and mental, is proper occupation, suited to the
age and strength of children. When the subject is approached from
ihe side of those who desire only the elimination of competition in
labor, the view is one sided and defective. The stringent limitation of
apprenticeship has put into our social body a problem of vast and mel
ancholy import. The importance of preventing improper child labor
below a minimum age cannot be overestimated. But what is to be
come of the youth of the country above that minimum presents per
plexities that may well engage public attention.
Under present conditions the only life in which youth may pre
serve health and at the same time be occupied and trained in thrift
and industry is in the country, in rural occupations, and outdoor
life. A hard and fast law which will prevent this, by compelling the
parents of rural families to get the consent of the sch6ol teachers to
the employment of their children in the light and necessary work of
the farm seems not only an improper invasion of the domestic rela
tion of parent and child, but it is a limitation hurtful to the children
themselves. A law that forbids the employment of children below
a minimum age in certain specified and hurtful occupations, putting
no limit on harmless and useful kinds of work which children may do
beneficially to themselves and helpfully to their parents, would seem
the wiser solution of the problem. Many a family is saved from
indigence and pauperism by the services of its children, and in such
families it is the rule that the children mature into good citizens,
temperate and thrifty.
The country has recently had an inspiring disclosure of this fact
in the election of Mr. John Johnson to the Governorship of Minne
sota. His father was an immigrant who had been a drunkard in
Sweden. After he came to this country he reformed, married, ac
quired property and thrived. When a young family depended upon
him he lapsed and rapidly went to the gutter, finally deserted his
family and left it to be supported by the mother as a washerwoman.
The oldest boy. John, under 12 years of age, of his own motion, quit
school and went to work at $10 a month, to aid his mother. He earned
$12 a mo;ith at 14. and then rapidly rose until he released his mother
from the washtub. supported the whole family, educated his brothers
and sisters, paid the mortgage on the home, acquired property, influ
ence and position. After serving in the Legislature he became the
Democratic nominee for Governor. His opponents sought to beat
him by disclosure of his origin. In their "street parades they carried
transparencies inscribed: "Don't vote for Johnson. His father was
a drunken loafer, llis mother was a washerwoman."' Johnson <
friends in alarm asked him to deny it. He said he could not. for it
was true. The people took the matter up: the career of the boy
was looked into; its struggle and its triumph were made public, and
he was elected by a large majority, although President Roosevelt ca- r
ried the State by 152.000.
Now if the law had prohibited that splendid boy working, his
mother would have broken under her burden, the family would have
become paupers, and he and his brothers and sisters would have
grown up in ignorance, and most likely in vice and uselessness. He
had helpful freedom and a great State gladly makes him its Gov
ernor and first citizen. Such an incident exhorts to legislative mod
eration in the matter of limitations upon the labor of the young, li
is true that there are parents who evade their natural duty to their
children and are willing to reverse the natural order and compel
them to work that the father and perhaps the mother, too. may live
in idleness and sloth. There are greedy and heartless employers, too,
who are willing to coin the future blood of the nation into money, by
employing children in places and in occupations fit only for the de
veloped strength of the adult. There are still others who with equal
greed seek a monopoly of the labor market, by denying the right of
apprenticeship to the youth of the country. But all of these denials
of the natural and legal rights of the young can be so dealt with as
to leave fitting forms of labor open to the John Johnsons of the coun
try, the brave little fellows who take the burden of their mothers and
step in the path of duty that may lead to the headship of a State.
The country wants that kind of material to have a chance. It wants
such families saved from the humiliation of pauperism and the
shame of dependence. We know of no way in which the State can
step in and take the place of such boys, and do the duty they elect
for themselves.
In discussing the divorce problem Dr. Jordan says, wisely, that
people must have leisure to be unhappy. If they are occupied con
tentment and patience have a chance to resist the temptations to con
jugal infelicity. So it is true that young and old must have leisure
to be vicious, criminal, disorderly and unclean.
WHILE reform in systems of taxation is in the air is the time
to give to it intelligent legislative attention. The subject of
taxation was formerly loosely considered all over this coun
try. Systems founded in a lack of scientific knowledge of the sub
ject have been permitted to endure, and their infirmities have even
been added to by subsequent legislation. But study of the whole sub
ject, which began in Xew York, where it was taken up by a commis
sion of which Francis E. Spinner was chairman, has gone on, until
certain definite principles have been developed and settled upon.
Governor Pardee's recommendations are in line with these prin
ciples. They require that an object of taxation shall be taxed by
but one taxable body, and for one purpose or connected series of
purposes. The objects of taxation should be so divided that the
State revenue is derived entirely from objects different from those
which yield the local revenue. This is the principle of local option
in assessment and taxation. When the local assessment is made, as
it does not touch the objects from which the State derives its reve
nue, the State will have no power to interfere by raising, lowering
or equalizing that local assessment with some other local assess
ment. Each locality will stand on its own bottom in respect to
taxation. â
In this way considerable economies will appear in the whole
process of assessment and taxation, and where now is cost and con
fusion there will appear economy, simplicity and efficiency. If the
constitution must be amended to secure this reform the object is
worth all the trouble.

now and then the delectable picture
of two young people, de;id in love With
each other, who are realizing at least
one brief hour of perfect bliss. What
we want is that aureate dream of love
which has more of truth in it than has
any sober-tinted fact. We feel the
need of an uplift of heart and spirit
such a.3 Tennyson gives us in the in
spiration of his poetic version of the
old romance of the sleeping Princess,
whose story' sweet he sings in his de
licious "Day Dream."
Every now and then a critic raises
the question: W r hy should love, either
aa a sentiment or as a passion, be \he
chosen theme Of story writers, to the
virtual exclusion of other interests?
When we look about us in the world
with which we are familiar, they say,
we do not see love as the central in
terest of most lives. If appearances
speak true, love does not take up
much of the average man's time, or
of his attention; and the situation is
practically the same with women.
In youth love dominates brilliantly
for a little while, or else it glows and
fades like an intermittent flame. But
it generally is a side issue. It is not
the plain business of life.
As if this were not in itself reason
enough for wanting love in our Ac
tion!
We have plenty of problems of our
own every day without paying good
money for imaginary woes to vex our
brains, unless they are mere nothings
thrown in for good measure and to
increase our ultimate satisfaction. The
stern realities of life are kill-joys,
every grim one of them. And we all
have an uncomfortable way of grow
ing old before we feel half ready to
do so.
At the same time, as long as we
live the thought of love will be to us
a thought of youthâdear, starry-eyed,
hopeful youth. 'Tis the only idea
the mind possesses which never grows
old in the course of our individual
experience, and the only one which |
carries with it no suggestion of age.
Even the associations we have with
spring and childhood and the beauties
of youth are significant of change.
But love is the one perfect, imperish
able idea which has come down to us
from the long ago golden age, when
everything was perfect and imper
ishable.
T.ove, you will remember, perhaps,
was the only one of the famous triad
of virtues Dante found in heaven.
Faith was not there, nor was Hope,
for the former is by nature an earthly
dream, which implies realization in
the perfected life, and the latter car
ries in its very longing for fulfillment
the promise of fruition. Love alone,
according to Dante, is immortal.
RETIRING THE SENATORS
Editor The Call, San Francisco:
With the opening of the present ses
sion of the State Legislature and the
election of a Senator, I ask your con
sideration of the following:
The Government of these United
States retires, at the age of 62, its mil
itary and naval officers. This is done
without reference to any officer's birth
or district of birth.
Now if the experience of years dic
tates this as prudential, why should
not each Senator at the same age of
life also be retired? Has politics a
stronger hold on the Government than
the Government has on its educated
and mature officers?

TELEGRAM
Otho B. Senga
FROM Gertrude Gates, visiting at
North Platte ranch, near Sidney,
Neb., to her young sister in Bos
ton:
"My Dear Helenâl am glad I told
you in my other letters of my trip,
and the ranch, and the beautiful
scenery, for hereafter I fear I shall
write mostly about Mr. Lloyd Burke,
Oh, Helen, he is splendidâso tall and
strong and commanding! He has
charge of a big ranch near here, which
is owned by a wealthy man in Chi
cago. Cousin Amy says he will have

see Lloyd coining."
one of his own some day. He has lent
me one of his horsesâa perfect beauty
âand we shall ride together often.
The girls in our set would envy me if
they could see Mr. Burkeâhe is very
handsome, and, he has the most de
lightful way of speaking. I don't know
a man in Boston to compare with him.
Don't fear that I shall fal! in love with
himâl hope I have sufficient family
pride to prevent that. I think he is
Irish. Don't let any one else see this
letter. Lovingly yours,
"GERTRUDE."
From Helen Gates to Gertrude:
"Dear Gertrude âIt's just as well
that you have no intention of falling
in love with the Irishman. Mamma
would never forgive you. The three
other gtriS have married to her entire
satisfa.. . .i>n. and you know she has
selected 'Pinky' Stauffer for youâthe
dear little doll with his millions.
"Of course I, a crippled dwarf, need
have no thought of marriage, but if
I were a tall, handsome girl like you
I'd marry a manânot a tailor's model.
And I wouldn't care if he were a Fee
jee Islander, if he were 'strong and
handsome,' and I liked him, as I be
lieve you're going to like this Mr.
Burke.
"Claude grows lazier every minute
âhe has engaged a valet now, trying
to be as near like "Pinky' as possible.
"Mamma expects to see your let
ters to me, but she shan't. If she
insists I'll scream, and she'll think I
am going to lose my mind. Oh, I know
how to fix mamma. I wouldn't do that
to papa, but he understands lots or
things that mamma doesn'tâgirls, for
instance. Write me all about the rides
and Mr. Burke. Your loving little sis
ter. HELEN."
From Gertrude to Helen:
"Dear Little Sisterâl wish I could tell
you of the beautiful life here âevery-
thing is so free and natural, and peo
ple seem to be glad they are aliveâ
I know I am. It's in the atmosphere,
I think.
"We go riding every day. I never
before knew the real pleasure of rid
ing. Riding around the parks on our
horses with their mincing little gait
isn't much like flying over the prairies
on this horse of Lloyd's. She takes a
long, swinging lope, and you feel as if
you and the horse were one, and that
you were being wafted through space
without effort or care.
"I am very happy, but sometimes I
am half afraid, because I believe Lloyd
is In love with me, and if he is, think
how dreadful to have to go back to
Boston and marry 'Pinky' Stauffer! 1
suppose mamma and 'Pinky' have set
the day, and" I dare say Claude will go
to Paris to buy the trousseau. The
mere thought of 'Pinky' Stauffer
makes me sick and faint. What a ter
rible thing to have to pass years and
years in his company! I know I can
never forget Lloyd Burke as long as
I live. I wish I felt as near to papa
as you do, Helen. Perhaps if I only
knew how to tell papa, he would find
some way to help me. Good-bv for
this time. I can see Lloyd comingâ
we are going for a long ride.
"GERTRUDE."
From Mrs. Gates to her daughter
Gertrude:
"My Dear DaughterâYour sister is
quite illâprostrated with nervousness
because I took your letter from her.
However, I always obey the dictates of
duty, regardless of the consequences to
any one, and under the care of your
father and Dr. Payne I trust she, wUI

"I desire your immediate return to
Boston. You may make Helen* illness
an excuse to Amy. Give our kind re
gards to her and her husband and ex
tend to them a cordial invitation to
visit us next winter.
"As for this person, Burke, you will,
if possible, make your departure with
out seeing him again. If this is not
possible I trust your sense of decorum
will suggest that you confine yourself
Bimply to that kind of courtesy that a
lady always bestows upon a worthy

FOR A MANAGER
Julius Kruttschnitt Says
Man for Southern Pacific
Has Not Been Chosen
HARRIMAN IX XO HURRY
Chief Operating Official
of Associated Railways
Here on Inspection Tour
â¢ Julius Kruttschnitt, vice president
of th' Southern Pacific Company and
or of maintenance and opera-
Liuns of the Harriman line 3, arrived
â¢ yesterday from the East by way of
Los Angeles and is staying at the St.
. Francis Hotel. His visit is for the
purpose of making a careful inspec
tion of the various branches of the
Harriman associated roads, where
millions of dollars are now being ex
pended in betterments, The moat im
portant improvements under way are
those on the Southern Pacific signal
.system, where the relaying of rails
â¢and the extending of the block signal
syÃtem is in progress. Of this work
Director Kruttschnitt said last even
' ing:
The company la laying about 100,000 tons of
'SO-pound steel rails which means about 800
mile* of track. Whin this work is completed.
â¢ which will bo before the end of 1905, the oom-
Dany will have the largest line of heavy railed
.-nd well balanced track in the world, extend
' leg from New Orleans to the Oregon boundary
.and back over the Central Pacific system.
â¢ which Is already In excellent shape. L*et
year the Southern Pacific Company estab
lished about 230 miles of highly developed
block signal system, and by the end of this
year the associated lines exjx-et to have be
tween 800 and 700 miles of the system In per
fect operation. We are putting the signal
Kj-stem In selected places, where the greatest
danger la supposed to exist. For years the
company has had a complete chart of the road,
and as fast as the points of danger are desig
nated the company extends this valuable sys
tem, which allows for two danger signals be
hind each train, onÂ« a caution, the other an
.absolute block.
PROUD OF ROADWAY.
Director Kruttschnitt added that
the company is making large addi
tion* to its rollin;; stock in the way
of locomotives, of which 100 have il
ready been ordered; also many new
passenger coache:; and freight cars.
Asked if the recent denial by the
Washington authorities of the com
- pany's application for a permit to
. construct a bridge across Carquinez
Straits would materially affect the
plans of the Harriman syndicate for
: improving its big Western system, he
said it would not. and remarked:
We should have liked to construct the bridge.
. for it would not only greatly facilitate the op
eration of our trains, but It would be of
â¢benefit to the traveling public. But the Gov
ernment having decided not to permit tho
liuilding of the bridge, it bimply remains for
the Southern Pacific Company to continue the
operation of Its trains under the present meth
ods. An elevated bridge is out of the ques
tion, for the cost would be beyond all reason.
â¢For months the Southern Pacific Company has
been expending vast sums in improving its
lin<-s and will continue to do so. Since I left
San Francisco to take up my duties In Chi
cago 1 have done much traveling over many
of the crack Eastern roads, and my judgment
is that nhared by a number of prominent rail
road officials of the East who have traveled
over our line, that wo have got a permanent
roadway equal to anything In this country.
" Between this city and Los Angeles there is
almost a perfect strip of roadway and few
lines can boast of anything surpassing the line
between Kan Francisco and Ogden.
NEW GENERAL MANAGER,
The coming of Director Kruttschnitt
to. San Francisco has been eagerly
looked formard to. Many local rail
road men had expected that while
here the head of the operating depart
ments of the Harriman lines would
decide Â©n a new manager for the
' Southern Pacific Company. Last even
ing, however, Director Kruttschnitt
â  said that no decision had been arrived
at. He admitted that the matter had
been discussed several times by Pres
ident Harriman and himself, but they
had come to no definite conclusion
and the question would probably not
be settled for some time. Meanwhile,
said Mr. Kruttschnitt, W. H. Bancroft
will continue to act as the general
manager. In discussing the appoint
ment he said:
It Is a pleasant boast of the company that
it has to-day the best set of officers of any
. road In the oountry. Everywhere they have
been working like soldiers, and we have ample
evidence that they enjoy the good feeling of
â¢ the men under them. These existing condi
tions naturally have a tendency to enhance the
value of the properties and give assurance to
. the men who are responsible for their financial
obligations.
Mr. Kruttschnitt expects to remain
in San Francisco until the end of the
week, during which he will be a very
busy man catching up with work of
his office in Chicago.
Why White Rode the Horse.
The parties contending over the
account of the executors of the estate
of Thomas J. Clunie were in Judge
Coffey's court again yesterday after
noon, but because of other pressing
engagements stipulated for a con
tinuance of a hearing until a week
from to-day. A moment's time was
given to the examination of Mabry
McMahon, a real estate dealer, in ex
planation of Burrell G. White's use
of a horse belonging to the Clunie es
tate, for whose keeping a bill was
c harged. McMahon said that he had
a Drivate stable and Clunie's horse
was kept there on a pro rata charge.
After Clunie's death McMahon had
. asked White to exercise the animal,
and these were the only occasions
upon which he used it.
Eppinger Case Continued.
The cases of Jacob and Herman
Eppinger, charged with obtaining
â¢money by false pretenses, were on
Judge Lawlor's calendar yesterday for*
trial. By consent a continuance was
ordered till February 13. The Grand
Jury has the Eppinger failure under
consideration, and is expected to act
between now and the date fixed for
the trial.

day brought suit in the Justices' Court agaiiiÂ«t
the Southern Pacific Railroad for $8 Ofi, al
leged to be rebate due on tickets purchased bj
him on December 2 of last year. Hister al
leges that he bought tickets from the company
entitling him to ride from Suisun to Mary?",
ville and was told at the time that If he
bought $20 worth he would get $8 SO as a
rebate. The company adopts this method to
prevent stop-overs during the trip.' When
Hister arrived at Marysvllle the rebate was
refused and the suit resulted.

General Convention to Open
in Denver To-Day and- to
Continue Through Week
DENVER, Jan. 9. âA meeting of the
cattlemen from every part of the coun
try was held to-night, at which the re
port of the board of managers was
read. It related chiefly to the efforts
made by the committee to secure leg
islation favorable to the cattle inter
ests. The members were warned that
the railroads would advance rates on
cattle in the near future unless the
cattlemen took active measures to pre
vent it. The report of the committee
was approved, and it was ordered to
continue its work of safeguarding the
interests of the cattlemen.
The city to-night is filled to over-
Mowing with delegates to the National
Livestock Convention, which, will open
here to-morrow, and which will last
through the greater part of the week.
There will be held throughout the week
meetings of numerous affiliated organ
izations, the wool growers leading off
this morning with their annual meet
ing.
There is a sharp division between the
cattlemen as to the advisability of al
lowing railroads and packers to have
representation in the governing body
of the association if the new plan of
organization is carried through. Presi
dent Frank G. Hagenbarth of the Live
stock Association is strongly in favor
of admitting them and he has a nu
merous following.
Many Western stockmen, while not
opposing the proposed reorganization,
are against allowing either railroads or
packers to have anything to say about
the affairs of the livestock men. They
contend that the railroads working in
conjunction with the packers have
compelled them to sell their cattle at
the lowest possible prices, and they ob
ject to an alliance with either one of
them.
At the meeting of the National Wool
Growers' Association this morning a
committee of seven was appointed to*
consider the proposed reorganization of
the National Livestock Association.
The proposed reorganization is based
upon the various branches of the live
stock industry, each branch being con
sidered as a unit.
L. V. Olcese of California and James
Gwin of Oregon were among those
who spoke on the wool industry.
CHILD WIFE HAS COURT
CORRECT HER MISTAKE
Married Before She Was Fourteen
Without Mother's Consent, She
Gets Union Annulled.
Ora McKean's infantile indiscretion
in marrying Fred James Leary when
she was only thirteen and a half years
old was rectified yesterday by Judge
Troutt, who annulled the union upon
testimony of the girl's mother that the
step had been taken without her con
sent. The marriage took place at
Oakland in November, 1898, and the
girl wife left her husband when she
was 15 years old. She does not know
where he now is.
Carl Jonnevold makes a shrewish
picture of his wife in a complaint for
divorce filed yesterday. He says that
she is habitually Intemperate, has
threatened to murder him in his
sleep, spit in his face and threatened
to get her friends to beat him. Other
suits to sever the marital tie were be
gun as follows: Mary Vavlo against
Pietro Vazio, for neglect; Mary Alice
Richardson against Robert E. Richard
son, whom she married In 1872,
habitual Intemperance; Mary E. Gil
lium against C. L. Gilllum, cruelty;
Tillie Debauge against Paul Debauge,
who was convicted in 1899 of man
slaughter and sentenced to ten years
in prison; Oscar Gordan against
Myrtle Gordan, desertion and infi
delity committed in Whltechapel dis
trict of Portland; William Baddeley
against Laura Baddeley, desertion.
Divorce was granted by Judge Mu
rasky to Francis Wacker from Eunice
I. Wacker on a cross-complaint for
desertion; by Judge Graham to Dorris
D. Ulrich from John F. Ulrich, cruelty;
by Judge Troutt to Aileen G. Wilkin
son from H. A. Wilkinson, neglect; to
Anna Kordt from Fred Kordt, intem
perance.
Judge Graham yesterday cited** John
R. Wood, former paying teller of the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank, to show
cause why he should not be punished
for contempt for not paying his wife's
December alimony.

JUDGE MORROW RETURNS

Carnegie Trustees Pro-vide Luther
Burbank With Means for Going
Ahead With His Life Work.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
returned yesterday after a month's
visit to Washington and New Tork.
He had been called to attend a meet
ing of the trustees of the Carnegie
Institute. The most important thing
done by the trustees, he said, was to
make financial arrangements whereby
Luther Burbank may be enabled to
devote himself exclusively to his life
task of experimenting in plant varia
tion for the benefit of the wor!.d.
Judge Morrow thinks the present
session of Congress will be a short
one. Nothing much will be done be

ing for cutting down the national ex
penditures.

NOT SURE THAT
HE IS MARRIED
Captain Milliken Tells of
Relations Between Himself
and Young FHipino Girl
â¦
ILLEGAL CEREMONIES
Army Officer States That He
Afterward Learned That
She Had Married Before
CHICAGO, Jan. 9.âCaptain Dawld B.
Milliken took the stand to-day in his
own defense at the court-martial at
Fort Sheridan to-day and detailed how
he and a Filipino girl, after eight
months of wooing in the town of Esca
lante, Negros Island, P. L, were "ille
gally" married, and how after a period
of uncertainty whether he was married
or not he participated in another "ille
gal" marriage, only to And. according
to his story, that his wife had been
previously married to a native Filipino.
This complication of marital doubt
induced him, he says, on one occasion
to report to the War Department he
was unmarried, and on another occa
sion to put an interrogation point after
the printed form "Married or single."
Milliken asserted that he made no at
tempt to conceal from the natives that
he had "gone through a sort of cere
mony" and that he considered himself
married.
"Why, then, did you not bring; your
family with you when you returned to
the United States?" asked Lieutenant
J. M. Kimbrough, Judge advocate and
prosecuting officer. "Did not your wife
and boy want to come?"
"Every effort to induce them to come
with me failed," he replied. "They did
not want to go so far away from home.
Her mother was old and feeble and
needed her attention, so I left them
there."
The captain said he met Reglna Ba
tlsmo, who is 20 years old, soon after
his arrival in the islands, in 1899, and
that his Interest in her began at once.
"Did you go to see her regularly?"
he was asked.
"Yes, I went to see her frequently.
Her parents were aware of my inten
tions," was his reply.
"Did you intend to marry her?"
"Yes, I did. I made no secret of that.
I tried to get the consent of her
parents, but could not because I was
not of the same religious faith they
were."

FIVE HUNDRED
AT ASTOR BALL
Leader of New York Society
Makes a Big Cut in Her
List From Last Winter
EVENT OF THE SEASON
Two Homes Thrown Open to
Receive the Guests, Which
Include Young and Old
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 9.âMrs. Astor, the
grand dame of New York society, to
night gave her annual ball. The Fifth
avenue home of the hostess, as well as
that of her son, John Jacob Astor,
which adjoin* it, waa thrown open,
giving ample space for the 500 or more
guests who accepted Mrs. Aster's Invi
tation. The scene was a most brilliant
one, made picturesque by a display of
superb costumes that has not been
surpassed by any private entertain
ment here.
Among the guests were the leaders
of New York society and many for
eigners of note now in the city. The
elder set, the representatives of "Old
New York," always conspicuous at
Mrs. Aster's, war* present in large
numbers. The younger set. Including
the charming debutantes of the season,
were upon the dancing floor and among
the men were not only the elders, but
the younger members of the dancing
set.
A spirited cotillon, led by Harry
Lehr and Mrs. Elisha Dyer Jr., was
danced, and when at a late hour,
when the last of the guests had de
ported, it marked the close of the most
successful event of the winter of 1904
--1905. There were about 500 guests pres
ent Instead of the proverbial "400" and
the 600 of last year.
There were elaborate floral decora
tions throughout the two houses. The
marble foyer was a mass of flowers,
palms and exquisite plants, bright
scarlet blossoms being used to great
advantage and contrasting with the
white marble walls. There were also
groups of deep red and brightest pink
azaleas. In the ballroom and the ;
drawing-room quantities of American
Beauty roses were used.
Mrs. Astor wore a superb costume of
royal purple velvet over pale blue
satin. The bodice of velvet waa em -
broidered with paillettes of gold in !
elaborate design and combined with I
cream lace and pale blue tulle. The
petticoat of Marie Antoinette effect,,
was on blue satin and the long train
of purple velvet. She wore magnificent
jewels, including a stomacher and cor
sage ornament of diamonds, a riviere"
of solitaires and a tiara of the same
gems.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD. Jan. 9. âRain was
fallinsr this morning when the sports
men who are here attending the field
trials awakened, and for a time it
seemed none of the Derby dogs would
he seen in action to-day. Shortly
before 10 o'clock the skies cleared,
and after a consultation between
President Van Arsdale and Secretary
Betz it was decided to make a start
for the preserves of the Field Trials
Club, upon the broad acres of the
JTevis property. Shooting clothes
were donned hastily and the cavalcade
pf enthusiasts soon moved off.
Four heats of the Derby were run
Â©ff and a series of beautiful sporting
pictures resulted, which delighted the
enthusiasts who watched the clever
Work of the highly bred setters and
pointers. The young dogs showed uik
usual class and were pronounced su
perior in the aggregate to those
shown in any previous year. The con
ditions are considered ideal for the
trials, as quail are found in great
numbers, and the rain has Improved
the ground over which the dogs will
work.
Brilliant sport is expected when the
older and more seasoned dogs meet
In competition.
The first brace of dogs were cast
â¢off near the Gosford ranch, in a pas
ture field. After two heats were run
the party repaired to the Gosford
house/where an elaborate luncheon
was discussed.
SPORTSMEN WELL SATISFIED.
After luncheon the party repaired
to the little schoolhouse, where a
brace of setters were turned down
and readily found birds. After this
brace was taken up the judge moved
off to a place about two miles east,
where a large covey was found scat
tered in excellent cover and were
â¢well handled by a brace of pointers,
which were put down on them. The
dogs were taken up at 4:40 p. m. and
the sportsmen returned to town well
pleased with the day's work.
The first brace put down was J. W.
Flynn's lemon and white pointer Nellie
P, handled by Charies Coutts, and the
Stockdale Kennels' liver and white
pointer Checkmate, handled by R. M.
Dodge. Nellie proved a fast, wide
ranger, making some brilliant casts
and working industriously in her efforts
to find birds. In this she succeeded

IMPORTED DOG WHICH MADE A
GOOD SHOWING IN FIRST DAY'S
TRIALS.
after a run of twenty minutes, locating
a small bevy in some low bushes.
Checkmate was sent over to back, but
on approaching Nellie caught scent and
pointed also. Both dogs proved steady
to shot. These were the only birds
pointed by this brace except one run
ning bird, which Checkmate caught
sight of and was inclined to chase. J.
W. Flynn's lemon and white pointer
Romp On, handled by W. B. Coutts,
and W. W. Van Arsdale's black, white
and tan English setter Modesto, handled
by C. H. Babcock, were put down near
the same place. A bevy was found in
some high weeds, which both dogs and
handlers went through without flush
ing. The spectators coming up flushed
a part of these birds and the dogs were
turned back on them. Romp On secured
two points, one of which was a bit un
steady. Modesto put to her credit the
same number. One of these Romp On
refused to back, and a rabbit running
within eight or ten feet of Modesto's
nose developed for her more interest
than the birds. She abandoned the
point and took after the rabfflt, but
soon returned to her handler. Modesto
started lame, but afterward developed
good speed and range, running with a
high head and merry tail action, out
classing Romp On in these respects.
The next brace was made up of J. E.
Terry's orange and white Better Romp,
handled by Fred Coutts, and J. H.
Schumacher's black, white and tan

English setter dog Sir Roderick, hand
led by W. B. Coutts. They were cast
off in an alfalfa field. Both dogs showed
good range and speed. Sir Roderick es
pecially making some wide casts.
DOGS LOCATE THE BIRDS.
Sir Roderick was first to locate birds.
He scored seven points to Romp's three.
This brace was a pair of real bird find
ers.
The last brace of dogs was J. W.
Flynn's black and white dog Burbank,
handled by W. B. Coutts, and the
Stockdale Kennels' black, white and
tan pointer Japan, handled by R. M.
Dodge. These were put down in a new
field, where a large number of birds
were scattered in splendid low cover.
They proved a brace of fast and merry
workers and wide rangers. All condi
tions being favorable, each scored a
large number of points and delighted
the spectators with as clever an exhibi
tion of point work as any fancier could
wish to see.
Burbank was a bit the faster and
proved the widest ranger. He some
what spoils his style by running with a
low head. The trials are run under
what is known as the "spotting sys
tem," and no decision is made between
any dogs until all have been through a
thorough trial. There are three and a
half brace of Derby dogs to be run to
morrow in the first series. While it is
possible the stake may be finished to
morrow, in all probability it will be
Wednesday noon before the winners
are known.

CHILD SPENDS NIGHT
IN THE CITY PRISON
little Ellen Harvey, Who Waa Kid
naped by Her Mother in Un
accustomed Lodgings.
Little eleven-year-old Ellen Harvey
spent last night in charge of the
matron at the City Prison because her
divorced parents quarreled over which
shall have custody of her. The child's
father, William Harvey, got a divorce
from her mother in 1897 and was
awarded custody of four children.
Ellen was the one dearest to him.
The mother drifted to this city, and
four years ago married J. Newberg,
a saloon-keeper at 66 Jackson street.
Harvey lived at Redding with his
four children. Last Wednesday Mrs.
Newberg made a flying trip to Red
ding and induced little Ellen to leave
with her. The father was distracted
by the disappearance of his favorite
child. He suspected that the mother
had a hand in it and traced the pair
to this city, where he engaged Attor
ney William Barnes. A writ of ha
beas corpus was granted by Judge
Lawlor and the mother surrendered
the child, who was taken in charge
by the matron at the City Prison.
Judge Lawlor will decide to-day as to
which parent is entitled to custody of
of the child.
The father says that the mother
visited the children only once a year.
He says he thinks Mrs. Newberg want
ed to put little Ellen on the variety
stage, as the child is bright -and tal
ented.
SAILOR WANTS DAMAGES. âGustave Carl
son filed a suit yesterday In the United States
District Court to recover $3132 from the Amer

juries. Carlson alleges that through negligence
of the master and owners of the vessel his
left band was mangled in a winch.
JOCKEYS M'BRIDE AND W. DAVIS APPEAR
TO THEIR BEST ADVANTAGE AT OAKLAND
Sea Air Downs Both
Silverskin and
Dr. Leggo.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The alertness of Jockey McÃride
stood him in good stead at Oakland
yesterday and the youngster demon
strated effectively that he is a mud
rider for fair. Three of the winners,
David Boland, Oro Viva and Sea Air,
but one, the first named, a favorite,
were driven in by McÃride, and the
Knebelkamp pilot finished second on
Dora I and third astride Silurian be
sides. As a post rider McÃride has no
equal at Oakland, but his clever work
was somewhat dimmed by a seemingly
unquenchable desire to resort to rough
tactics. Possibly the young man likes
to pay fines and take vacations on
the ground. W. Davis also kept his
excellent average up by twice passing
the wire on winners, as well as being
placed with Silverskin.
- A first-class card drew a large at
tendance and little fault could be
found with the caliber of the sport.
While the course itself looked slushy
and uninviting, form was well main
tained, three public choices earning
brackets and outsiders being kept
well in the background. Haven Run
at o\'z to 1 proved the longest priced
winner of the afternoon.
FAVORITE FIRST AT WIRE.
Serenity, the entry of Dayton &
Kahn, was much the best of the dozen
starters in the opening mile selling
run, and won easily, after looking
hopelessly out of it at one stage. Al
Waddle and Maxtress alternated in
cutting out the pace for half the route,
then Maxtress forged ahead. The lat
ter tired the last furlong, and C. Mil
ler, bringing Serenity along, scored
without difficulty by a length. Sam
Greenfield kept Al Waddle going long
enough to take the show. The winner
went to the post a 13 to 5 favorite.
In the selling number for 3-year-olds
at six furlongs, David Boland, the
favorite, with McÃride in the saddle,
made his company look like thirty
cents. At the wire David finished un
der wraps, with Handy Bill, the closest
horse, six lengths away. Golden Buck,
which met with some interference at
the start, ran a fair third.
Willie Harris finally drew down a
purse with Haven Run. The gelding
was 5% to 1 in the betting on the split
of the mile selling fixture. And. ridden
by Davis, won all the way. The fa
vorite, Silurian, lost the place to War
Times, the mount of Tommy Clark.
Trapsetter. a warm tip, finished back
in the bunch.
McBRIDE LANDS AGAIN.
McÃride landed his second winner
when he placed Oro Viva over the
home plate winner of the mile and 100
yard run, also decided under selling
conditions. McÃride kept Bullman,
astride Darksome, pinned in on the
rail where the going was deepest, arid
at the finish received a neck decision
over Briers, the lukewarm favorite.
Travers, who rode Dr. Rowell's marc,
bumped El Piloto and Darksome the
last part of the race and was disquali
fied. This moved Darksome into
second place and gave the show to
El Piloto.
At any of the shorter sprinting dis
tances Bell, Reed seems well nigh
unbeatable; that is. in his class. The
chestnut had a decided call in the
betting on the five and a half furlong
scramble, and. excellently ridden by
L%.vis, assumed the leading position
early, and at the wire disposed of
Dora I with something in reserve.
Matt Hogan moved up from fifth po
sition, leading Hainault, the second
choice, out for the small end of the
purse.
Charley McCafferty's good colt, Dr.
Leggo. a 7 to 10 favorite for the con
cluding six-furlong purse affair, for
three-year-olds, was not there with his
customary assortment of speed. Bon
ner rode the Doctor, of course, and
picked the worst going he could find,
finishing third. The smart division
played Silverskin and, they went down,
too. McÃride got away sailing with
Sea Air. and. in a driving finish,
downed the gray mare more than a
length. The favorite ran third.
TRACK NOTES.
J. W. Brooks of Ascot Park was a
visitor at Oakland yesterday.
"Kansas" Price, who sent School
mate down to Los Angeles last week,
will ship the balance of his string to
the southern city within a few days.
Tony Barrett is now the owner of
Silicate, having purchased the mare
from Walter Jennings. She is a full
sister to Fossil.
Keene & Co. have sold The Repro
bate, and Mansard will be fired. Jack
Keene leaves for Kentucky soon.
Walter Jennings has received an of
fer for Arabo from "Kansas" Price,
and the chestnut horse will likely
change hands. Arabo is at present in
Los Angeles. <
Charley Henshall is hot on the trail
of any horses trained by George
Wentworth ever since the latter
claimed Ishlana. After Oro Viva had
run the fourth race Henshall bid the
bay horse up from $800 to $I<2oo and
secured him.
Frank Doss is also out and ready
with his halter ever since Major Man
sir was claimed. He bid up David
Boland from $600 to $1200, but did
not secure the three-year-old, aa
Baird & Co. came back with the cus
tomary Â»$ 5 to retain.
The decision of the judges disqual
ifying Briers met with general ap
proval. The rough riding of Travers
was no doubt unintentional, but that
is no excuse for knocking down half
the horses starting in a race.
Every time the names of Miss Cul
ver or Handy Bill appear among the
entries it rains.
Both Princess Zula and Golden
Buck were interfered with at the start
by David Boland.
Davis, who rode Silverskin, lodged
a claim of foul with the judges against
McÃride, the pilot of Sea Air. Mc-
Bride did some jockeying all right,
but as Davis has been handy at the
same game himself the officials proba
bly concluded to let the numbers
stand as they finished.
Roach May Be Drafted.
CINCINNATI, Jan. 9.âAt a long
session of the National Baseball Com
mission to-day various pending dif
ferences between the national associa
tion and the minor leagues were set
tled. In the case affecting Roach's
connection with the Butte, Montana,
club, the minors to-day finally acqui
esced in the decision of the national
commission that that player had
signed a non-reserve contract and
therefore was subject to draft.

four clubs in four cities. Lucas and
John McCloskey are now in Spokane

BIG WRESTLERS
MEET TO-NIGHT
Jenkins and Carkeek Will
Compete on the Mat for
Championship of Country
Jack Carkeek will make his San
Francisco bow to-night on the big mat
at Woodward's Pavilion to swap trials
of his great strength with Tom Jen
kins. For more than fifteen years
Carkeek has held the palm at catch-as
catch-can wrestling, defying the best
men in the world to put his shoulders
to the floor in this particular style of
the game. Jenkins has won and lost
with men that Carkeek has never met
in the last few years and he is consid
ered America's greatest wrestler be
cause Carkeek has spent most of the
last few years in foreign lands. In
bringing them together Manager Mor
ris Levy has made one of the most in
teresting matches possible and the en
tertainment promises great results.
The catch-as-c'atch-can style permits
of more action than any other. Prac
tically any hold is permitted, the legs
as well as the arms being brought into
frequent play. To eliminate any aem
blance of brutality the strangle hold
has been barred; everything else goes,
and the spectators will see some clever
tricks between these two masters.
Falls are limited to an hour each, best
two in three, but both men say there
will be no need of the stipulation. They
are both out to win early.
To popularize the sport with ladies
it has been determined to admit them
free when accompanied by escorts, and
the balcony will be reserved for the
gentler sex.
Shortly after 8 o'clock the prelimi
nary match will be called between two
local favorites, George Braun and Al
Brill, representing rival clubs. This
bout will be under the same conditions
as the big affair. George Miehling will
act as referee.
FAINTS AND FALLS INTO
AN OPEN FIREPLACE
Mendocino County Resident Is Se
verely Burned at His Home
Near Covelo.
COVELO. Jan. 9.âNews has Just
been received here of the severe burn
ing of Charles Coulter at his home on
the North Eel River yesterday. While
sitting in front of a fireplace he fainted
and fell into the fire. The upper part
cf his body was badly burned and he
Is not expected to live.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
In July, 1883, I began to break out with
Eczema on my head, legs and arms, and
began treatment with local doctors, but
did not get much relief. They said the dis
ease had become chronic. I then quit them
and tried various ointments and soaps for
another two years, but as soon as cold
weather came I was as bad off as ever, so I
finally decided to let medicine alone, and
for twelve or thirteen years did nothing
towards curing the Eczema, except bath
ing. This seemed to do about as much
good as anything I had tried.
During the time I lost about one-half of
my hair. I began S. S. S. doubtful of a
cure, because the disease had run so long,
but soon discovered your medicine was
doing me good, and continued to take it.
I used seven bottles, when I was com
pletely cured, not having a single spot on
my body, which before was almost com
pletely covered. F. C. Norfolk.
1017 Hackberry St., Ottumwa, la.
The head*, feet and hands are usually
the parts affected, though the disease ap
pears on other parts of the body. While ex
ternal applications allay the itching and
burning temporarily, it is the acids thrown
off by the blood that cause the irritation
and eruptions upon the skin. The acids
must be neutralized and the system cleans
ed of all humors and poisons before the
cure is permanent.

Wrecked on the Drydock.
' Placinz the steam schooner Lakme on the
â¢ drydock at Hunters Point has proved more
disastrous for the coaster than all the bump
ing she experienced on the Humboldt bar.
When the Sea Rover, which brought the
Lakme in from sea. shoved her waterlogged
charge Inside the big basin the Lakme, al
though full of water, was sound of hull. So
'jight, In fact, were the coaster s seams that
holes had to be bored through the planking,
as the. drydock slowly emptied, to release the
water shipped at sea. Before the Lakme's
hull was out of water the steam schooner,
which had not been securely braced, toppled
over and in the fall several of the keel blocks
were driven through the Lakme's timbers. A*
a result of this fall the Lakme is a good dea
of a wreck and the cost of repairing her will
now be some thousands of dollars greater than
it. otherwise would have been.

CAPTAIN ANDERSON
ESCAPES BY BLUNDER
Prosecution Fails to Attempt to Prove
That the Schooner Vine Is an
American Vessel.
Because of a blunder made by the
prosecution, Olaf Anderson, master of
the schooner VJ/ie, escaped conviction
yesterday In tLe United States Dis
trict Court and was released. Captain
Anderson was charged with beating
and wounding his steward, John San
ders, on the high seas while the Vine
was at the Caroline Islands last Aug
ust. Sanders is a Japanese, and he
failed to have the captain's coffee on
time. The beating was proved by all
the witnesses and it looked like a
conviction until Judge de Haven ex
ploded a thunderbolt in his charge to
the jury. He said that among other
things, before a conviction could be
had, it was necessary that it should
have been proved that the Vine was
an American vessel. The jury might
possibly remember, said the Judge,
that such testimony had been intro
duced, but the court did not.
Upon this hint the jury acquitted
Captain Anderson.
Balcony Gives Way With Load.
A balcony in the rear of 106 Haight
street gave way yesterday while
Thomas Shea, who lives at 41 Erie
street, was passing over it with, a load
of coal on his back. Between the
weight of Shea's burden and the
broken pieces of wood he sustained
injuries about the head, shoulders
and back that necessitated his
moval to the Emergency Hospital for
treatment. This was given by Dr.
Herzog.

STEAMBOAT COLLISION
UNDER INVESTIGATION
Masters of the Grace Dollar and the
Saint Helena Make Statements
of Conflicting Nature.
United States Local Inspectors
Bolles and Bulger began an investiga
tion yesterday into a collision which
occurred on the bay on December 15
between the steamer Grace Dollar and
the steamer Saint Helena.
E. M. Olsen, master of the Grace
Dollar, testified that at 2 o'clock on
the morning of the date mentioned,
while coming in abreast of Lombard
street wharf, he saw the Saint Helena
approaching and blew two blasts of
the whistle, while putting the helm
hard a-starboard. He said he received
no reply whatever from the Saint He
lena. When the vessels were coming
together Captain Olsen reversed his
engines and went full speed astern.
Then he heard three blasts from the
other steamer and the collision took
place.
Captain McNulty of the Saint He
lena said that just before the collision
he heard two blasts that he could not
locate. As soon as he saw the Grace
Dollar approaching he stopped, back
ed at full speed astern and blew four
blasts, then three. No answer waa
made by the other steamer. The Dol
lar struck the Saint Helena amidships
and pulled away without offering any
assistance or giving her name when
requested to do so. Captain McNulty
finding his ship leaking badly, beached
her at the Occidental Warehouse
flats.
Brewery Wagon and Car Collide.
An inbound Turk-street car came
into collision with a brewery wag-on
yesterday at the crossing of Leaven
worth. John Lafranz, the driver, was
knocked from his seat on the wagon.
In falling he struck the ground with
sufficient force to fracture his right
shoulder blade, besides inflicting con
tused injuries on his back and shoul
ders. The injured man waa treated
at the Emergency Hospital by Dr.
Carl G. Wilson.
HARRISON TELLS
OF BIG THIRSTS
Says Alexander Dunsmuir
Never Quit Until He Got
to the Physical Limit
OLYMPIAN IS NETTLED
Athletic Clubman Offers
to Put on Gloves With
Cross - Examiner ' Coyne
William Greer Harrison was the star ;
witness in the Dunsmuir case yester- i
day. He told what he knew about the
clubman's propensity for drink and
said that Alex Dunsmuir had a tremen
dous thirst. He did not drink any more
than the set he moved with in club life.
When questioned by Judge Coyne as to
what he called a drinking man, or a
man who enjoyed the indulgences of
club life, Harrison said that Alex kept
about even with the pace.
"Well," said Judge Coyne, "what is
the pace?"
"Oh." said Mr. Harrison, "anywhere
from ten to twenty drinks a day."
"Now, Mr. Harrison," said Judge
Coyne, "was there no limit to Mr, I
Dunsmuir's drinking?"
"Oh, yes," said Harrison, ' Mr. Duns- i
muir had his limit."
"Well, Mr. Harrison," questioned
Judge Coyne, "what was that limit?"
"The limit was when he couldn't
drink any more."
Mr. Harrison waa then questioned re
garding the domicile of Alexander
Dunsmuir. Harrison had frequently
heard Dunsmuir say that his home was
in Victoria, but what the real meaning
of the word "home" was, Mr. Harrison
did not fully answer. He admitted that
he had lived for twenty years in New
Zealand and that sometimes the people
over there referred in a general way to
England as home.
When closely questioned by Sir
Charles H. Tupper he said that while
England was really his home, after all
he meant to say Ireland was really
where he was born.
At this stage of the game Judge
Coyne took up the cross-examination.
From the start of the questioning Har
rison was nettled. The first thing he
said was that h- trusted Judge Coyne
would be very short in his cross-exam
ination. The witness said he had an
engagement with a lady.
GALLANT HARRISON.
"Now," said Mr. Harrison, "if I keep
this lady waiting she will be very mad
at you, Judge Coyne."
Judge Coyne replied, "Oh, I am used
to having the ladies mad at me."
"Mr. Harrison, I understand you to
say that Mr. Alexander Dunsmuir,
during the years of 1892 and '93, while
he was a member of the Pacific Union
Club, was not a robust man?"
"Well." answered Harrison, "he
never was an athlete, and I measure
most men by that standard."
"I understand that you consider
yourself a first-class athlete?"
Harrison sharply replied, "I should
be glad to put on the gloves any day
with you at the Olympic Club."
Judge Coyne said he*was not in the
sporting field, so he declined the invi
tation. This ended the little bout, and
i matters again got down to the pro
i sale.
1 "Mr. Harrison, I want to ask you."
' said Judge Coyne, "was Alexander
Dunsmuir at this time getting in
firm?"
i "Years were telling on him," replied
Harrison.
i "Was he well preserved for a man
lof 50?"
At this point Harrison parried the
question, but .said that he was sure
that "Dunsmuir is well preserved now."
t Judge Coyne asked if the physical
! condition of Alexander Dunsmuir
! would have been improved if he had
i led an athletic life. "I cannot answer
that," said Harrison, "for I did not con
nect his physical condition with his
; long thirst."
"When you called on Mr. and Mrs.
! Dunsmuir at their home in town, or at
! the residence of Mrs. Wallace, as you
! state, do you know who paid the rent
jof the house Mrs. Wallace was living
I in at that time?"
Harrison promptly responded. "I
| don't know who paid the rent, but I
have no doubt that Alexander paid it
all the same."
FIXING DOMICILE.
The task of establishing the domicile
of Alexander Dunsmuir was the pur
! pose of the attorneys of James Duns
muir yesterday. Following Mr. Har
i rison A. E. Brook Ridley was
j called. He was a non-communi
cative witness on every point. He
had only known Alexander Dunsmuir a
short time. He knew him because he
was asked to make a bid on the install
ing of an electric power plant on the
Dunsmuir coal docks here. He also
i put in an electric plant at the home of
| Alexander Dunsmuir at San Leandro.
'He could not tell much .. f the put
j ting in of the plant at San Lean-
I dro and he knew little about where the
! power came from. He always thought
i the home at San Leandro was intended
; for Mrs. Wallace. When Mrs. Wallace
went East with Mr. Dunsmuir he un
derstood that she was going East to
buy furniture for the San Leandro
; home. He admitted that before the
! couple left for the East they were
i married.
; J. Eugene Freeman, the architect
who built the San Leandro home, was
: one of the witnesses. He did not know
! Alexander Dunsmuir very well. He
had a general impression that his
home was in Victoria.
Rufus Van Schaick testified that he
had known Dunsmuir for twenty-eight
years. He said he "joshed" along with
Dunsmuir. He called Dunsmuir "Alec"
and Dunsmuir called him "Van." They
occasionally took a drink together. He
had never heard Alexander Dunsmuir
say whether he had closed up the coal
business here. '
Further taking of testimony before
Commissioner Bennett will be resumed
to-morrow morning at 10:30 o'clock.

FOLK PROPOSES
MANY REFORMS
Public Integrity Key Note
| of Inaugural Speech of
| Missouri's New Governor
WOULD STOP LOBBYING
Favors Compulsory Voting
and Says He Will Try to
Settle Labor Disputes
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Jan. 9.â
William J. Bryan, who came with his
wife to-day to attend the inauguration
of Governor Fulk, addressed the Leg
islature at the invitation of the Re
publican House. The speaker, who was
heartily received, congratulated the
people on the election of Folk, because,
he said, It was the reward for duty
well performed. Corporation influ
ences, the speaker said, often controll
ed officials, and to stop this he favored
municipal ownership of public institu
tions. He advocated the establishment
of State fire and State life insurance
departments to furnish insurance to
the people at cost.
"I do not think our banks are safe," |
said Bryan. "They are so arranged j
that they make money in good times
and throw the? risk on the depositor in |
bad times." He then made reference j
to the affair of Mrs. Chadwlck.
Bryan commended President Roose
velt for recommending legislation to
have campaign contributions printed, j
Promptly at noon Joseph W. Folk j
was inaugurated Governor of Missouri.
The ceremonies took place in the j
House of Representatives, which had
been appropriately decorated. Gov
ernor Folk in his inaugural address
said, in >art:
Partisanship is a good thing sometimes, but
patriotism Is a better thing all the time. Par- |
tisanship iÂ» well enough when it does not l
conflict with patriotism, but patriotism is a
higher virtue than partisanship. Some of you !
are Democrats, Borne are Republicans, all are (
Missourians. In the discharge of official dv- |
ties let .is be Missourians before we are any- â 
thing else. Do not forget that you will be ,
aiding the party you may belong to most by t
giving the public the highest service. You
cannot help your party by injuring the public, j
One may be in private life a Democrat or ,
Republican, but when he steps into public
office he becomes a public servant âa servant of
ail the people.
If there be any corruption during this ses- |
sion of the General Assembly it would be a :
disgrace to the Stat? and a reflection on every
man of this body and upon every official In
the State government.
It is not always by taking money that an
official may prostitute his trust. He does it
whenever he uses the power given him to be
exercised for the public good for any other
purpose.
In order to aid in the investigation of rumors
of corruption, laws should be enacted com
pelling witnesses to testify as to their knowl
edge of bribery transactions and exempting
such witnesses from prosecution for any mat
ters directly or indirectly growing out of such
testimony. . ..
When a legislator accepts a pass he puts it
in the knowledge of the representative of the
railroad that he has violated the law and is
subject to indictment. This knowledge can be
used by the railroad representative to club the
legislator into submission to corporate inter
ests. Professional lobbying should be made a
crime. . , .
When a corporation obtains a franchise it
Is forfeited by non-use. Apply this Principle
to the privilege of voting and it will do more
than anything else to remedy the evil of civic
indifference that Is the weakness of a republi
can form of government. :,
As another step in (he direction of govern
ment by the people. United States Senators
ought to be elected by the people, and Mis
souri should lead the demand for a constitu
tional amendment providing for this reform.
I believe it is the province of the Governor
of the State to keep the public peace by
settling disputes between employers and em
ployes and he should make it his busings as
tar as possible to do so, if the contest involve,
the public Interest in any way.
BLITZ PAXTON ESCAPES
PAYING DOCTOR'S BILL
Supreme Court Thinks Mother Is
Technically Liable for Debt of
Minor Daughter, Roma.
The Supreme Court decided yester
day that Blitz Paxton could not by
law be compelled to pay for medical
services rendered to his minor daugh
ter, Roma. The defendant's wife,
Bessie, must settle the bills out of the
$100 a month paid her by her former
husband. The action was instituted
by Grant Self ridge.
The Paxtona were divorced in 1894,
but no mention was made in the de
cree as to which should have the cus
tody of the daughter. By private
agreement Paxton paid his wife $5620
and promised to contribute $100 a
month for the support of the children.
Several years later the little girl Roma
was taken ill and heavy medical bills
were incurred before her sickness was
ended. , .
Selfridge brought suit against Blitz
and Bessie Paxton jointly and the Su
perior Court held that the husband
was financially responsible for the
doctor's bills. The Supreme Court re
verses that decision on technical
grounds.

San Francisco and one in Oakland.
The sale of the property was consid
ered to be the best way for all con
cerned. The creditors, through their
committee, have acquiesced in the
sale, which is satisfactory to all par
ties in interest. An investigation of
the affairs of the Olsons convinced
the creditors' committee that the only
cause that led to the Olsons' financial
trouble was the attempt to carry a
large volume of business with too lit
tle capital. The business will be car
ried on by Mr. Fish.

PLEA FOR BOY
OF THE SLUMS
Jacob A. Riis Says Environ
ments Are Responsible
for Making of the Tough
LECTURES AT ALHAMBRA
Sprightly Humor Enlivens
a Thoughtful Address on
Reforming Street Savage
Jacob A. Rlss gave his famous lec
ture, "Tony's Hardships," to an aud
ience that crowded the Alhambra last
night. He told of the making of the
"tough," how the environments of
the slums stifled moral sense and de
veloped the character of the hoodlum,
driving home his thrusts at society
for denying a chance to the boy of
good opportunity. There were fre
quent sallies of humor.
In battling with the environments ,
of tenements In thickly populated
streets and alleys, In Improving the
conditions to give the boy a chance,
lay the keynote, the speaker urged,
of any plan to reclaim a community
from the terrorism of the hoodlum
gang. Twenty-five years of earnest
work among the slums of New York
have taken out of Riis the folly of the
theorist.
The name of President Roosevelt
was frequently mentioned in telling
of his efforts while a Police Commis- I
sioner, in co-operation with the speak- j
er, in the war they carried on for the
light and air and health and better j
conditions In the tenement districts of
New York. Jacob Riis is very earnest
on the platform. He pleads with heart
afire "to let the boy play ball." He
says the lad is like a boiler and there
must be an exhaust valve. The boy
must let off steam in play, and when
the policeman drives him off the va- |
cant lot he becomes one of "the ;
gang," and seeks his joy and glory
and spice of danger in acts of hood- !
lumism. Playgrounds, good schools
and good homes are what Riis wants
for the boy.
WANTONNESS BORN.
Denied every advantage of life vir
tually was Tony and there was noth
ing in the institutions of society that
he had respect for. The lecturer de
scribed how the spirit of wantonness
was thus inculcated on every hand in
this boy, whom he caught in the act
of flinging mud at the stained Window
of a church. Even when he laid his
hand on Tony's shoulder the boy
started as if a policeman was on him.
for the thought could not enter his
mind that it was a friendly hand.
The speaker had small with
the' theory that heredity is a factor
of any consequence in the formation
of character. Environment is what
goes to the making of the bÂ«V, he in
sisted. Here Riis told one o. his bf-st
stories. He said:
I dlreussed this question of heredity with
Grover Cleveland on one occasion. He dis
agreed with me and in Illustration of his point
end that he believed it was dv-? to character
inherit-d from his good New England ancestors
that prompted him. when a very small boy.
t.. n turn the egp that a neighbor's h?n had
I. ' in his father's yard.
jw my father and mother were very good, j
Ood fearing peopl", and I can remember how
I coaxed a neighbor's hen. by laying out a
trail of grain, to come over Into my father s
yard and lay the egg she was cackling about.
"There is not so much in heredity as
neoole think," declared the speaker,
"and thank God for that, because it
gives us a working doctrine to shape
things. It is the environment, the
drunken father, the want of a good
mother, the corrupting influences of the
tenement, in fact, an utter lack of any
and all opportunities to grow into good
manhood, that makes the savage of
the boy Tony."
BEWARE OF TENEMENTS.
The warning was sounded to San
Francisco to beware of the building of
tenement houses, some of which had
bfen erected, according to letters re
reived by the lecturer. "You will have
to pay a frightful interest in money,
In wasted manhood and bad citizen
ship," was the message of one who
knows the depths of the tenement evil
of New York. He said:
In the kindergarten problem there are two
pillars of truth that must be observed. First,
play is normal occupation in which the
chlid first receives knowledge of moral rela
tions: second, the child learns by doing things.
There must be ample playgrounds and in doing
things he must come in contact with the good
things of iife. But every little plot of ground
that a municipality possesses is usually fenced
off and a big sign reads "Keep off the grass.
It looks as if the nation were a worshipper of
grass.
Riis argued that it would be far bet
ter to let the children have these
grounds for their play.
For the most part the parents of the
little savage of the streets are of for
eign birth. Tony comes to regard his
father as "Dutch and slow." He loses
the respect for paternal authority. He
grows up without moral sense, without
character, and the authorities in the
reformatories will invariably say that
it is this weakness, and not wicked
ness, that ails the boys.
GOD'S IMAGE THERE.
"But," said the lecturer, "the Image
of God could always be found where
the face had been crusted over with
the slums." There was abundant hope
for the urchin of Tony's class. The
speaker related the story of the arrest
of the "Kid," one of the most hardened
characters of darkest New York.
While being marched to prison between
two policemen, it remained for the
"Kid" to risk his life to save a child
from being run over by a car. The
spark was there that should have been
kindled when the now desperate crim
inal was a boy.
"Fighting Mary" was one of the sad
dest productions of the New York
slums, yet when she was caught se
creting food at a charity dinner for the
poor her confession was that her moth
er was starving at home. Here, as well,
was the wisp of a flame that might
have been fanned into good woman
hood.
Reformation of the landlord, the
kindergarten school, the settlement,
and, most important of all in the
speaker's estimation, the boys' club,
were the principal lines of effort to fol
low in the making of a better boy of
Tony. The boys' club is Intended to
head off the reformatories, not by
teaching the three R's alone, but the
three H's as well âthe heart, head and
hand. It must be guided by the three
S's âsense, sympathy and sanityâand
when its fruits shall become manifest
there will be less disposition to follow
the political boss and a great upbuild
ing in good citizenship.
The entertaining and instructive lec
ture was frequently interrupted by ap
plause, and it was evident that Jacob
A. Riis held a warm place in the hearts
of his auditors. He was Introduced by
Fairfax H. Wheelan as "our brother."
and the sentiment waa given more
than warm approval.
To-morrow evening Mr. Riis will lec
ture at the Y. M. C. A. auditorium on
"A Vacation in Denmark." It will be
illustrated by stereopticon views and
Â£iven for the benefit of the building
fund of the Danish Lutheran Church
of this city. The lecture will begin at

THE OOFFEE SITUATION.
Position of the Staple and Its
Outlook.
The New York circular of Henry Nordllnger
. A Co. says:
"As to the prospective position of Coffee
as a result of the movement during the next
six months, the last six months of the crop
...year. While the port stocsk in the United
: States are unuaually large. It is well known
.â  that, the interior cities (barring one or two
which have of late begun to buy more freely)
.are very poorly supplied and we do not think
â¢ we lean to exaggeration In our estimate that
. the Interior cities of the United States as a
whole carry at present three quarters of a
â â¢â  million to a,million bags less Coffee than they
bave uaually been carrying heretofore. From
tÂ«rope we receive similar reports, but the
;;o*itioa in Europe Is even worse in this re
Â»peot, that their port stocks are about one and
:'. a half million bags less and their Interior
. f locks from one to one and a half million
rags less than they were a year ago. We
.. have, therefore, very good reasons to look for
;an improved consumptive demand and while
.â¢ We put the deliveries for the next six months
â¢.at only 7,800,000 bags, we expect them to
â¢ reach fully eight million bags.
â¢ "Although we start the second half of the
â .crop year with a visible supply of about the
. rime extent as a year ago, we must remark
tnat on October 1 last the world's visible sup
ply was about 500,000 bags in excess of what
â¢ it-was on October 1 the year before. This aa
. cess has since been wiped out. The ae
â¢â c.reaa* In existing stocks will no doubt con
tinue- and we expect same to become acute
'.Juring this and the following months. The
. receipts during that time at Rio and Santos,
is well .as those of mild sorts, will be con
â¢ eic'eraMy less than came forward in previous
years and the deliveries from ]Â«>rt stocks on
â¢the other hand are sure to show an unusual
â¢ expansion due to the depletion of stocks in
et distributing centers in this country as
/Will as those of Europe. From these ex
pected increases in the deliveries we exclude
."â¢tin? month of January, during which the de
liveries last year reached unusual proportions,
;du<Â» to belated purchases by interior merchants,
â  conditions which prevailed at thnt time having
. been similar to those existing at present.
"European houses with hardly an excep
tion, believe that the current Rio and Santos
crop will be In the neighborhood of ten mil
lion bags and their belief is not an unreason
â¢â  able one In view of the quantity received so
tar. Had we not followed the causes of the
.movement so closely as we did, we would most
'likely agree with our European friends. On
the basis, however, of information received
"by us from most reliable and disinterested cor
; respondents In Brazil, we are willing to go
â¢in record' that the present crop will not be
. more than about nine and a half million bags,
-and may turn out to be quite some less.
"MiH Coffees, the bulk of which usually
o<>fr>e forward during the months of March.
'â¢April and May. and of which last year a sur
i i.i burly end exceptionally heavy movement
Vat encountered for trie whole period of the
."sis ninths from January to June, will show
,;in? off as compared with last year to the
exten.l of about one and a half million bags.
â  Reports from Venezuela. Colombia. Costa Rica.
Nicaragua. Salvador, Porto Rico and Haytl
are all to the one effect, that a very small
.-cop has been grown and we calculate the
.fallimt oft" m the receipts from those coun
tries In the aggregate at fully 40 per cent.
. On. the other hand. (Guatemala and Mexico
' lvÂ« : â¢ nt favorable reports and their crops will
ibt show seme Increase over last year."

New York Stock Market.
;.:NEW YORK, Jan. 9.âThe second week of
. Jhe new year in the stock market started off
with some animation and brisk advances were
scored pretty generally. But the start proved
i. Ta o ls'e one, like that of the first week of
'rhe year and Interest had almost completely
died out by the afternoon. It was apparent
that the movement represented very largely
â  a trial of speculative sentiment In professional
â¢Derations. Lust week the hnlt and the re
action In the market were attributed In a con
tsileraf.ie degree to the Influence of the threat
of - legislation to regulate corporations. The
lsfbrer.ee of the professional traders that the
sellers of last week on this account would turn
â¢ Buyers on the new situation wps general, but
Proved to be 111-founded. The bank statement
of last Saturday was little regarded. Loans
for sixty days could be had for below 3 per
o/-nt to-day. ThÂ« operations for further cx
tenslve gold imports this week were also de
prived of much of their effect by this con
dition of the local money market. With dis
counts advancing In London and the pros
pect of some further largo loan Issues In
that market the movement of capital to that
center lr. ; m here with money at the present
â  unrenttineratlva ratot Is not to be wondered
a - ;. The routine news cf the day continued
â¢favorable to values. Railroad traffic officials
erraln reported the freight maximum limited
only by the ability of the railroads to carry
what was offered, while heavy car shortages
tend to congest what cannot be promptly
carried. The morning's upward movement waa
fairly general, as was the afternoon reaction,
ajany of the morning's gains were wiped out
.1 4he afternoon and the closing was dull and
â¢J^ak.

CHICAGO BOAK1) OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 9.âWith the exception of a
short period of uncertainty immediately after
the opening, sentiment In the wheat pit was
decidedly bullish. Influenced by firm cables
and by a liberal decrease in the amount of
breadstuffs on passage, the market was firm
at the opening, May being up %c to %c at
11 13% to Â«1 15%. The situation in the
Northwest, however, was apparently less
bullish, arrivals to-day showing: a considerable
increase over recent receipts. As a result of
the freer movement there was fair scattered
selling by commission houses. Offerings were
not readily taken and In consequence prices
reached a slight setback, May declining to
$1 15%. Later news f;-om the Northwest be
came more encouraging to bull traders, an
excellent demand for cash wheat, especially of
the lower grade, being reported at Minneapo
lis. On active cohering by shorts prices be
came quite buoyant. A decided source of anx
iety to shorts was an official forecast for a
cold wave in Kansas and Nebraska, where the
winter crop is said to be Insufficiently protected
by snow. A report that the world's monthly
visible supply would show a decrease of 10.
--000,000 bushels compared with the correspond
ing week a year ago. was another factor partly
responsible for the strength manifested later in
the day. After May had sold up to si 17%
a reaction occurred on profit taking, the price
dropping back to |1 16%Â®l 17. The market,
however, quickly rallied on renewed covering.
Final quotations on May were at $1 17%.
Notwithstanding the strength of wheat, the
corn market was barely steady. May opened
unchanged to a shade lower at 44%Â®44%c to
44% c, sold between 44%0 and 44%@44%c, and
closed at 44%@44%c.
Mr.y oats opened a shade lower at 30% c.
sold between 30%Â®30%c and 31c and closed
at 30% c. /
A lite advance In the price of hogs had a
strengthening effect on the provisions mar
ket. At the close May pork was up 7%c, lard
2%<65c higher and ribs 5c higher.

Butter. Cheese and Eggs.
Eggs were lower yesterday, with receipts
rather liberal for Monday and stocks showing
an accumulation in a number of stores. Deal
ers are meeting buyers more than half way, as
they want to keep their supplies as low as
possible at this time of the year, when the
production Increases rapidly. Stocks of fresh
Eastern are reduced to a low point, but there
are still a good many cold-storage goods here.
Butter was dull and easy at the quotations
ruling on Saturday, and some houses reported
accumulating stocks, which they found very
hard to move.
Cheese was dull and unchanged.
Receipts were 44,100 lbs Butter, 503 cases
Eggs and 0400 lbs Cheese.

WHEELAN GIVES
HIS EVIDENCE
Accuser of Wyman Declares
That Election Officers
Knew Vote Was a Fraud
DEFINITION OF A BOSS
Â«
Says That Siaestretti, the
Employer of Defendant,
' Answers the Term Fully
Interest in the trial of Charles Wy
man for fraudulently voting reached
an interesting stage in Judge Law
lor's court yesterday afternoon when
Fairfax H. Wheelan took the stand.
In a clear manner the witness de
clared that he had seen the defendant
copy the name of S. H. Mann from the
roster of the Seventy-third primary
precinct on August 9 of last year and
enter the same as his own on. the
precinct register. Then, declared
Wheelan, "Wyrnan, purporting to be
S. H. Mann, voted ballot No. 31,928.
Attorney Countryman cross-exam
ined Wheelan minutely, but the wit
ness was ready for every point.
"What do you consider good citi
zenship?" asked Countryman.
"The ticket opposed to Mr. RuÂ«,"
replied the witness quietly.
"Do you know Mr. Kuef ?"
"Only through Mr. Maestretti, boas
of the district."
"What is a boss?" was asked.
"A volume could be writen in ex
planation of the term," was the re
ply. "Mr. Maestretti fills it to the
full."
The witness was pressed to define
the word boss, with Mr. Maestretti as
an example.
"Maestretti sends to conventions
delegates he can use," declared Whea
lan. "He never sends any one whom
he cannot use. He distributes the
loaves and ri3hes. He holds meetings
on the nights before primaries."
Wheelan gave an account of h's
movements on the date of the pri
mary, telling how he visited the
Almshouse yrecinct "to help prevent
the unfortunates from being voted like
cattle." .At about 4 he visited Precinct
73 of the Thirty-ninth District, where,
he declared, he saw Wyman commit
the felony.
"When you saw Wyman enter the
name of S. H. Mann in the register
why did you not challenge the vote?"
asked Countryman.
"Because some of the election of
ficers were not of the faith, and oth
ers were controlled by Maestretti. 1
acted as I thought best for the inter
ests of good citizenship."
"You say you saw Wyman commit
a felony. Why did you not accuse him
at the time?"
"T was not certain as to who he was
and I had no protection against the
election officers. They might have
said that he was S. H. Mann. I am
satisfied that they all knew Wyman
was voting fraudulently."
When District Attorney Byington
pointed to Wyman and asked, "Is thi*
the man?" the defendant looked
down and naled a trifle.
Before the cross-examination was
finished Countryman asked permission
to withdraw to the telephone.
The court then asked if the jury
was tired. On receiving a decided af
firmative, the trial was continued un
til 9:30 this morning.

POWDER TRUST SEEKS AN
INSPECTION OF RECORDS
Applies for Writ of Mandate to Com
pel Opening of Peyton Chemical
Company's Books.
The E. L Dv Pont de Nemours
Powder Company of New Jersey,
otherwise known as the powder trust,
which was recently defeated in a suit
for injunction to prevent the Peyton
Chemical Company from selling $30,
--000 worth of the trust's stock in the
â¢ local concern for delinquent assess
ment, yesterday applied to the Su
perior Court for a writ of mandate
compelling the company and its secre
tary, J. P. Wallace, to permit an in
spection of the records, minutes of
meetings and stock books of the chem
. ;lcal corporation.
It is set forth that application for
the inspection was made to the sec
retary on October 29, before the stock
was to be sold for assessment, and that
it waff refused. Therefore, says the
trust, it has been damaged in the sum
of $30,000. Judge Lawlor granted an
alternative writ in the case, returnable
to-morrow morning before Judge
Seawell.

ASTHMA AND AESTHETICISM
IN FAMILY CONFLICT.
SON ADJURES PARENT
TO CHANGE HIS TUNE
Limited Gamut Causes a Domestic Jar
Discord was foreign to the home of
the Millers, 1153 McAllister street, until
asthma entered and clashed with es
theticism. Since then the peace inter
vals have been infrequent. \
It was the father of the faVnily who
introduced the pulmonary ailment.
From an occasional wheeze it was rap
idly promoted to a steady purr by un
avoidable contact with the winter at
mosphere, greatly to the distress of its
possessor and the unfilial disgust of his
first-born son, Frank C, a husky young
patternmaker, who had absorbed a
yearning for life's sweetness and light
and an inverse ratio of loathing for all
that savored of the coarse and vulgar.
Father's labored breathing jarred
harshly on the son's refined nerve
fibers. The younger man shunned the
older's society as well as the limited
hide-and-seek facilities of the house
would permit, but there were places
and times when the dreaded meeting
could not conveniently be sidestepped.
The dining-room and the dinner hour
were the youth's daily horror. There
and then he must sit at table with the
author of his being, whose struggles
with food were unpleasant to see and
to hear. They almost impaired Master
Frank's appetite.
The climax came last Sunday, after a
long period of "nagging" by the son
and inarticulate repartee by tha sire.
The latter was engaged with soup
when Frank sarcastically requested
him to change the tune.
"So long as you are doomed to par
take of your bouillon vocally, as it
were," Frank is reported to have said,
"there is no reason why you should
not vary your selections. You are the
most monotonous soup-gurgler I ever
heard. Your gamut covers about four
notes. Please try and extend your
range. If you must give this daily re
cital, why not rehearse some more pre
tentious number, such as 'The Tann
hauser Overture' or 'Tip, Tip, Tippe
canoe'? As a human wind instrument
you are amenable to improvement."
Mr. Miller, between splutters, retort
ed in anger, and word provoked word
until the Dea.ee was disturbed most vio
lently by Frank. So now he is a de
fendant before Judge Mogan, who will
hear all the testimony to-morrow.
Pat Cooney was inebriated when he
lurched and fell against the window of
Henry Augestine's tonsorial parlor at
3201 Nineteenth street, but the crash
of breaking glass apparently had a
sobering effect, for heÂ«ran away. The
barber and a constantly enlarging
crowd went in pursuit and nabbed the
fugitive while he was endeavoring to
burrow his way to concealment in the
sand of a vacant lot. Burglary was
the charge booked against him, but
.Judge Mogan scouted it and pro
nounced him guilty of malicious mis
chief. Sentence to-day.
George Connell, who was contem
plating suicide by means of poison and
pistol when a policeman thwarted his
intention, said he was unmarried and
without dependents.
"Which makes your intended self-de
struction appear all the more coward
ly," remarked Judge Fritz. "The man
who has a family suffering because of
his Inability to prevent it can be ex
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
cused, perhaps, if he seeks to evade
tugnizanoe of it by killing- himself, but
the man whose world-battle is for him
self alone shows a paltry spirit when
he abandon:- the field, especially when
he has such rugged health as you pos
sess. Go and try to keep yourself
alive."
A philosophical bailiff declared that
self-removal of the Connell spirit from
this sphere would %c the, best thing
that could happen to him and a good
tlung for the s;.here itself.
â¢ â¦ â¢
'Tin not guilty," was Dorothy Mc-
Cade's answer to Judge Mogan's query
as to how she desired to plead to two
charges of passing worthless checks.
Then her attorney waived a jury trial
and the court set January 17 for the
hearing.
The complainants against the woman*
are Weinstock, Lubin & Co. and the
Emporium Company, each having ac
cepted from her a, check for $50, drawn
on the State Bank of San Bernardino,
in which institution she had no funds.
She remains in prison.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Frank McGovern obtained from John
Flaherty a meal ticket by pleading that
he was hungry and penniless, but Mr.
Flaherty discovered that his benevo
lence had been imposed on and he
soundly thrashed the impostor. Judge
Fritz gave both of them twenty-four
hours.
* * * â¢
Louise Mason, young, pretty and
gowned in brightest blue, laughed de
risively when Solomon Cople, peddler,
told Judge Cabaniss that she had ob
tained by false pretense two floor rugs.
Mr. Cople could have his old rugs, she
averred, for goodness knows she must
have been crazy when she admitted
sue h trash to her home. Since she com
mitted that indiscretion her artistic
sense has been constantly jarred by the
hideous design and garish coloring of
the things, and they could not be re
moved any too quickly to suit her. At
tempt to steal them? Mercy! She
would as soon think of attempting to
steal the man who inveigled her into
purchasing them, and gracious knows
nobody would ever think of adopting
him for purpose of household decora
tion. Ha! ha! '
Mr. Solomon testified that when he
displayed the rugs to Miss Mason at
the front door of 235 Shipley street
she rapturously gazed upon them and
eagerly inquired their price. He offered
to accept $1 on the spot and 25 cents
a week until she paid him a total of
$8 50, when he would give her a re-
i ceipt in full. She said she did not have '
j a dollar in her possession just then, ;
i but would he trust her till the mor-
I row and leave the rug? He would, and
;he did. When he called to collect, as
j per appointment, he was met by an
-1 other lady, who assured him that Miss
' Mason did not reside there at all.
, Alarmed, he obtained a warrant for
' Miss Mason's arrest, and the police
i man to whom the service of the docu
ment was entrusted found and ar
rested her on the ground floor of that
very house.
The Judge advised Mr. Cople to go
to the house and recover his prooerty,
i but the advice was rejected. "There's
I a man there," said Mr. Cople, "and I
! don't desire to meet him again."
"You needn't be afraid," said Miss
Mason, "for he won't eat you."
Mr. Cople finally decided to revisit
235, but a policeman will accompany |
him. v

In the language of the music halls,
"it look.* like curtains" for John Smith
âwhich is not his nameâwhose arrest
for burglary was effected through the
courage, presence of mind and strategy
of a woman, MrÃ. E. Baumbach, of 1661
Golden Gate avenue. Not only have
the police testimony more than ample
to convict him of that particular fel
ony, but they have two more burglary
cases against him which, they aver, are
equally well fortified. *
Mr. Smith was actively plying his vo
cation at a grocery opposite Mrs.
Baumbach's residence at 1:30 o'clock
yesterday morning when intuition or
something else induced the lady to peep
out of her window, and there she saw
the burglar at work. She neither
screamed nor swooned, but quietly
went to her telephone and notified the
nearest police station of what she had
seen. When the police arrived they
found that Mr. Smith had effected an
entrance to the store and was inside,
where they cornered him as if he were
a rat in a trap.
Two other stores in the Western Ad
dition were robbed the same night, and
the police claim ability to prove Smith
the perpetrator of both of the rob
beries. He was arraigned before
Judge Mogan and will have a hearing
to-morrow.

William Beppler, who manages a sa
loon at 204 Third street, was annoyed
by the snoring of Robert Davis, a

ejecting its operator from the premises.
Mr. Davis resisted expulsion and Mr,
Beppler struck his head with a club,
inflicting such severe injury that the
man is still in the hospital. Judge Mo
gan has continued the hearing against
Mr. Beppler until next Thursday.

STATE INCOME

Lawsuit Over Eight to Bun
Ferry News Stand Proves
Beneficial to Taxpayers
FOSTER & OREAR WIN
Supreme Court Says Harbor
Commission Must Award
Lease to Highest Bidder
Charles Foster and Horace Orear
have won their legal battle- for the
privilege of conducting the ferry news
stand and parcel repository. The ap
peal of the Harbor Commissioners for
a new trial was dismissed by the Su
preme Court yesterday after extended
argument. Charles Spear's brother-in
law, John Rooney, will have to seek
some occupation other than retailing
The Call, current magazines and chew
ing gum to commuters. The fight in
the courts has been of long duration, .
but it has been a benefit to the tax
payers.
Poster & Orear conducted the fer- |
ry news stand for many years prior j
to Spear's appointment to the Harbor 1
Commission. The profit from the goods
they sold to travelers enabled them
at some personal sacrifice to pay $430
a month as rent to the State. Rooney
thought he might improve the busi- j
ness to such an extent as to be able
to pay a rent of $600 a month. Foster j
& Orear subsequently decided they I
would rather pay $1180 a month than j
be separated from the business that
they had developed so well. Rooney j
went into a trance and offered to '
donate $1200 to the people of Califor- j
nia each month for the right to con- \
duct the news stand. Foster & 1
Orear raised to $1500 and Rooney failed
to call, but the commission awarded i
him the contract.
The erstwhile lessees appealed to the ,
Superior Court, which decided that they ;
were entitled to continue in the busi- I
ness provided that no one raised their
bid. The Harbor Commissioners
a\Varded the privilege to Foster &
Orear and then appealed.
The Supreme Court says that the
point is a purely academic one, in view j
of the fact that the award has been i
given and the appeal of the commis- j
sion is accordingly dismissed. Until |
Rooney or some one else bids higher
than Foster & Orear, they have the
right to remain where they are. The i
controversy has netted the State $1070
a month.

"SALAMMBO" PROVES
STANGE A DRAMATIST
Warde and Kid
der Effective in
Main Roles.
Brilliant Stage
Pictures Add
1 to Plag.
Stanislaus Stange and "Salammbo"
! are a conjunction that suggests visions
i not wholly irreverent. To Mr. Stange
jwe are indebted for much that is en-
I gaging in comic opera libretti. To him
I most lately has been intrusted the flt
! ting of Madame Schumann-Heinck into
j comic opera garb, and with entire suc
cess by report. But Stange and "Sa
, larambo!"-Harry B. Smith might
come a little more hilariously in the
connection, but not much. You cannot
help expectingâthey did the play last
night at the Columbiaâthe barbarian
| Matho to jaunt into Carthage on a toy
j auto, or Salammbo to plan a theater
I hat out of the veil of Tanit.
But things do not fall out at all that
I way. Mr. Stange's dramatization of
Flaubert's immortal work proved to
jbe as dignified as it is genuinely dra
-1 matic. The tremendous spectacular
i possibilities of the story are, of course,
: immediately evident; its dramatic ele
-1 ment, separated from the brilliant de
scriptive detail of which it is so inti
j mately a part, seems a less certain
I quantity. Granted music, yes, for the
I story suggests eminently operatic
. treatment. Reyer, Ferdinand Reyer,
j some time ago made opera of it with
| out any very pronounced success. (It
I was produced in Paris perhaps four
I years ago, with only 700 people in the
J cast.) Mr. Stange, however, has suc
ceeded in building a lucid, well-knit
i drama on the story, with the salient
; situations retained and with the essen
! tial dramatic rhythm. The situations
. are posed in logical and cumulative
fashion, and it is not Mr. Stange's fault
that the leading lady suggests "Judith"
i ânor perhaps that of Flaubert. I am
j unsure of the "Judith" date. Mr.
I Maeterlinck's "Monna Vanna" has,
however, the distinction to come after
! both of theseâwith the heroine in the
| tent of th,e tyrant, whom/she afterward
! loves.
j Again Mr. Stange's exposition is par
-1 ticularly clever. The situation In
Carthage, the Greek view of it, the
! mercenaries' view, the characters in
the play are all brought quickly,
easily and happily to the attention and
from then on the interest never flags.
The pictures, also, are admirably
characteristic, the scenes including the
garden of the temple of Tanit and
Moloch, Salammbo's apartments, the
tent of Matho, the ruins of the temple
:of Delos and the Acropolis, all staged
j with considerable splendor and com
| mendable regard for historical accu-
I racy.
A word as to the dialogue. Here
: one naturally feared. Yet Mr. Stange
has acquited himself here again with
dignity and even distinction. Even
Flaubert, with his irritable ear, could
hardly find that which would much
offend.
To Frederick Warde and Miss Kath
ryn Kidder we are indebted for the
i production of the play, Mr. Warde
I himself appearing as Matho, the bar
barian, and Miss Kidder as Salammbo.
I The work of both players is too well
known here to require much com
! ment, nor is there any new phase
jto demand it. Mr. Warde is the same
! earnest, mannered, dignified, emphat
jic person as always, his clean cut
; word, however, coming with new
! agreeableness. He does not convince
! wholly as the barbarian, but there are
; some moments when even Mr.
, Warde's very clean and very pink
tights and curried skins do not pre-
I vent one's belief in his Matho. These,
mostly, are in the tent scene, when
Salammbo comes to wile the veil from
Matho.
I Miss Kidder is stately, classical and
| cool as usual as Salammbo, looking
the part very effectively, and lifting
sometimes to its dramatic need. A
bit of quite good work is that done by
Thomas Coffin Cooke as Spendius. an
oh* Greek slave. Dudley Kellerd,
, Wadsworth Harris as Hamilcar, and
â¢ Robert Dempster are all worthy of
I mention, and the whole'of the large
; cast keeps well within the picture. The
j musical setting by Henry K. Hadley
; adds mueh v to the charm and atmos
j phere of the play.
The audience last night gave token
I of enjoying the play, which is, indeed,
; well worth seeing.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
The Chutes.
Plenty of good variety is offered at
| the Chutes this week. The new pro
gramme yesterday was thoroughly en
joyed at both performances. Ernest
Wilson and Marie Leicester present a
i very pretty singing act, which they
style "Love Stories Told in Song." The
four Gordons give a startling acro
batic exhibition, Dan Russell and
Blanche O'Nell have some capital fun
in "Sullivan, the Coachman," and the
Burton bell ringers produce charm
ing music from their sweet toned in
struments. Eldridge, who paints por
traits and pictures in sand; Mabel
Lamson, the popular singer of illus
trated songs, and the American Bio
graph, showing American and Euro
pean moving pictures, complete a
strong bill.
Majestic.
A crowded house greeted the initial
1 performance of "Mizpah" at the Ma
jestic last night. It is a magnificent
poetical drama created by Ella
Wheeler Wilcox and Luscombe Sea
relle. Blanche Partington will visit
th* Majestic this evening and one of
her characteristically entertaining and
instructive criticisms of the perform
ance will appear in to-morrow morn
ing's edition of The Call. %
Lyceum.
The Lyceum Theater has scored suc
cess with its new programme, which
is strengthened by a number of the
most popular and successful artists in
vaudeville. Among those who are de
servedly popular are the Star Trio, the
Four Oliphans, the Yale Duo, Sallie
Randall, Charles Richards and Ward
and Cantor. The motion pictures are
a fascinating feature of a delightful
programme.
Fischer's.
' An excellent bill is being presented
this week at Fischer's Theater. The
new numbers are exceptionally good.
The large audience that attended the
performance last night showed its ap
preciation of the show
Burnt Cork Is
a Diversion at
Central.
Minstrels Deal
Out Some New
Jests. â¢
"How do you feel, Mr. Mayall?" In
quired the interlocutor.
"Me, Mistah Webstah? Oh, sah, Ah
feels quite spiritualistic, Ah does," was
the prompt answer.
"Spiritualistic? How bo, sir?"
"Kase Ah feels medium, sah."
That was neither the oldest nor the
newest of the quips launched from the
"ends" at the "conversationalist in the
center" of the Central Theater minstrel
show, first part. The shelf-worn tale
of the two little fleas, one of whom
urged the other to "get on to the dog,"
was narrated in detail, and the same
Mr. Mayall declared that he did not de
sire to go to heaven because there are
no ladies there. Interlocutor Webster
laughed the idea to scorn and vehe
mently declared that heaven was pack
ed with femininity, but he was instant
ly driven to confusion by Mr. Mayall's
quotation from the Bible: "There was
silence in heaven for half an hour."
But it was an extremely interesting
show. The "troupe" comprised the
players who have been mouthing melo
dramatic lines on the same stage all
this seasonâmen and women whom one
would suppose were least fitted by
temperament and training- to undertake
delineation of the Ethiopian of min
strelsy, either old-time or modern.
That's what made the performance so
interesting. Nobody expected lifelike
portraitureâand nobody got it. From
the stately leading man down to the
humblest actor of "bits," the spirit of
the "legit" refused to be eliminated.
When a pun was expounded the tone
was heavy and the delivery deliberate.
Mr. Mayall's voice descended to subter
raneanism in his duologues with Inter
locutor Webster, who also measured his
words with the precision essential to
effective enunciation.
Of the singing, the least said the bet
ter, if serious criticism had been angled
for by the vocalists. In the opening
chorus the voices were as uneven in
attack as a squad of rookies tackling
the goose step, and when they were not
dodging each other they were either
leading or chasing the orchestra. The
solos fared better as to tempo, but the
singers were undisguisedly gratified
when permitted to resume their seats.
"Thank the Lord!" fervently exclaimed
Mr. Corrigan after he had toiled
through a topical ditty. But his prayer
was made premature by the laughing
audience compelling an encore. When
Mr. Shubert toed* the scratch to venture
"Come Back, Babe," he glanced whim
sically at the grinning spectators and
audibly hoped they "didn't have 'em
with 'em," thereby meaning eggs, of
course. But he was rewarded with
hearty handclaps instead of hen fruit.
Only one conundrumâa metrical
poserâwas sprung during the even
ing, and Ben T. Dillon, formerly of
Fischer's and later of the Tivoli, did
it. Mr. Dillon, by the by, was as much
at home in blackface comedy as he
ever appeared in burlesque or comic
opera eccentrics. He joked, sang and
danced with an ease that provoked
envious glances from his stage com~
panions. Just wait till they get him
in melodrama!
Mr. Halifax, on the tambo end. de
plored the spectacle oi so many
straight actors descending to negro
impersonation, and averred that they
should be with Booth or Barrett or
McCullough. Whereupon the inter
locutor reminded Mr. Halifax that the
once great histrionic named were
"dead ones." But not a word of his
averment did Mr. Halifax take back.
Mr. Webster's announcement that
he wasVoing to sing "A Warrior
Bold' started a wcrdy altercation be
tween two young men in a stage box,
and their discussion waxed so loud as
to provoke indignant murmurs from
the parquet, angry glances from
the stage, and finally to interrupt the
song. No sooner did the singer re
commence, however, than the squab
ble reopened with augmented fury
and developed into a fight with fists.
One of the combatants fell, the other
stooped over him, and next instant a
heavy body was hurled to the stage.
It was a dummy. That brought the
curtain.
A regulation olio embraced the
usual sketches, songs and dances.
Walter Shannon, the new juvenile
man. proved possession of a remark
ably fine barytone voice. The per
formance concluded with a fares
that brought out the entire strength
of the company.
The Central Minstrels will be one
of the week's big drawing cards. Their
exact like was never attempted be
fore, but the cordiality with which the
innovation has been received indicates
that other dramatic stock companies
will relieve their routine once in a
while by donning the burnt cork.

CURED BY CUTICURA
IN TWO WEEKS
Mrs. George J. Steese, of 701 Coburn
St., Akron. Ohio.'tells in the following
letter of another of those remarkable
cures of torturing, disfiguring skin
humors daily made by Cuticuri Soap,
assisted by Cuticura Ointment,
after physicians, and all else had
failed: "I feel it my duty to parents
of other poor suffering babies to tell
you what Cuticura has done for mr
little daughter. She broke out all
over her body with a humor, and we
used everything recommended, but
without results. I called in three doc
tors, they all claimed they help
her, but she continued to grow worse.
Her body was a mass of sores, and her
little face was eaten â¢ay, her ears
looked A if they would drop off.
Neighbors advised me to get Cuticura
Soap and Ointment, and before I had
used half of the cake of soap and
box of ointment the sores had all
healed, and my little one's face'and
body was as clear as a new-born babe's.
I would not be without it again if it
cost five dollars, instead of seventy-five
cents, which is all Â«it cost us to cure
our baby, afterupenling many dollars
on doctors and medicines without any
benefit â whatever."
SLEEP FOR BABIES
Rest for Mothers.
Instant relief and refreshing sleep
for skin-tortured babies, and rest for

Alcazar.
"Lost River," by Joseph Arthur, au
thor of "Blue Jeans" and "On the
Wabash," was produced last night at
the Alcazar before a large and well
pleased audience. The play is well
constructed, the story developing in in
terest untillthe climax. The third act
is melodramatic, the heroine on horse
back being pursued by two robbers,
also mounted on spirited steeds, which
on making - their first appearance be
hind the footlights seemed to have
half a mind to take a header into the
orchestra. In this scene Mr. Craig
warms up and exhibits real dramatic
fire when he breaks down the toll gate
with a new ax to let his sweetheart
ride through and when he holds the
mounted robbers at bay at the pistol's
point. Mr. Craig is well supported by
Lillian Lawrence, who gives a faithful
dramatic portraiture of Ora Jones, the
country girl. Grandma Gates, an ec
centric but lovable character, is in th 9
capable hands of Miss Christie Mac-
Lean, her business in the ballroom
scene being specially good. Luke Con
ncss and John B. Maher are the high
and low villains of the play and keep
the ball rolling. The character of
Gladys Middleton, the handsome and
peppery tempered daughter of the
wealthy contractor, is well portrayed
by Ruth Allen, who looked and acted
the part most ingenuously. Harry
Hilliard and Elizabeth Woodson, the
juveniles of the cast, furnished much
Innocent fun. *

The last week of Blanche Bates In
