**Â«"! OLMES," said I, as I stood
â¢ â¢ I \ ont morning In our bow
jj window, looking down the
~J street, "here Is a madman
**^ coming along. It - seems
rather sad that his relatives should al
low him to come out alone."
My friend rose lazily from his arm
chair and etood with his hands in the
pockets of his dressing gown, looking
over my shoulder. It was a bright,
crisp February morning, and the snow
of the day before still lay deep upon
the ground, shimmering brightly in the
wintry inn. Down the center of Baker
street It bad been ploughed into a
brown, crumbly band by the traffic, but
at s either side and on the heaped-up
edges of the footpaths It still lay aa
white as when It felL The gray pave
ment had been cleaned and scraped, but
was still dangerously slippery, so that
there were fewer passengers than
usual. Indeed, from the direction of the
Metropolitan station no one was coming
save the single gentleman whose eccen
tric conduct had drawn my attention.
~^He was a nan of about fifty, tall,
portly and imposing, with a massive,
strongly marked face and a command-
Ing figure. He was dressed In a somber
yet rich style in black frock coat, shin
ing hat. neat brown gaiters and well
cut pearl-gray trousers. Yet his actions
were in absurd contrast to the dignity
of his dress and features, for he was
running hard, wi i occasional li--ie
springs, such as a wearyman gives who
is little accustomed to set any tax upon
his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands
up and down, haggled his head and
writhed his face into the most extraor
dinary contortions. \u25a0
"What on earth can be the matter
with him?". I asked. "He Is looking up
&i the numbers of the* houses." **
"I 'believe that he JÂ«* coining here," said
Holmes, rubbing h<g hnnfl*,
"Tes; I rather think he is coming
consult me prof essionally. I , think that
I recognize the . symptoms. Ha! Did I
not tell you?" As he spoke the man, puf
fing and blowing, rushed at our door and
pulled at our bell until the whole house
resounded with the clanging.
A few moments later he was In our
â om. still puffing, still gesticulating, but
th so fixed a look of grief and despairf
his eyes that our smiles were turned
1^- an Instant to horror and pity. For a
he could not get his words out, but
swayed his body and plucked at his hair
like one who has been driven to the ex
treme limits of his reason. Then, sud
denly springing to his feet, he beat his
head against the wall with .such force
that we both rushed upon him and tore
him away to the center of the room.
Eberlock Holmes pushed him down into
an easy chair, and, sitting beside him,
patted bis hand and chatted with Mm in
the easy, soothing tones which he' knew
so well how to employ.
**You have comÂ© to tell me your story,
have you not?" said he. "You are fa
tigued with your haste. Pray wait until
you have recovered yourself, and then I
shall be most happy to look Into any lit
tle problem which you may submit to
xae."
The man sat for a minute or more with
a heaving chest, fighting against his emo
tion. Then he passed his handkerchief
over his brow, set his lips tight and
turned his lace toward us.
"No doubt you think me mad?" said
he. " â¢ *
. "I see that you have had some great
trouble," responded Holmes.
"God knows I have! â a trouble which
Is enough to unseat ray reason, so sud
aÂ«i and so terrible is It. Public- dis
gÂ£sce I might have faced, although I
am a man whose character has never
yet borne a stain. Private affliction
also is the lot of everyjnan. but the
two coming together and in so fright
ful a form have been enough to shake
my rery souL Besides, it is not I
aline. The very noblest in the land
may suiter unless some way be found
out of this horrible affair."
"Pray compose" yourself, sir," said
Holmes, "and let me have a clear ac
count of who you are and what It. is
that has befallen you."
"My name," answered our visitor, "is
probably, familiar to your ears. I am
Alexander Holder of the banking firm
of Holder & Stevenson of Threadneedle
street." ...
The name was Indeed well known to
us as belonging to the senior partner
in the second largest private -banking
concern In the city of ILoridon. . What
could have happened, then.': to bring
one of the foremost citizens of London
to this most pitiable' pass? We waited,
all curiosity, until, with .another effort,
he braced himself to tell "his story
"l feel that, time Is' ;*of; value," said
he; "that Is why I hastened Jiere when
the police Inspector suggested - that I

When ;l\was < a youngster I have opened

"He i often had a'wild way of talking, so

could not bear' the disgrace. I must raise
the money in some way, and If you will
not let me have It then I must try other

"I was very angr>\ for. this was . the
third demand during the month. 'You
shall not have a farthing from me!' I
cried, on which he bowed and left the
room - without another word.
"When he was gone I unlocked- my
bureau, made sure that my treasure was
safe and locked it again. Then I started
to go round the house to see that all was
secureâ a duty which I usually leave to
Mary, but which I thought It well to per
form myself that night. AÂ» I came down
the stairs I saw Mary hÂ«iÂ«elf at the Bide
window of the" hall, which ehe closed and
fastened as I approached.
" *TÂ«11 me. fiad,' said she, looking, I
thought, a little disturbed, 'did , you

""Certainly not.'
'"She came in just now by the back

"'You must speakto her in the morn
ing, or I will,, if s"bu prefer^ it. .Are
you sure that everything is fastÂ«ned?'
" 'Quite sure, dad.!
" 'Then, good-night.' I kissed her
and went up to my bedroom again,
where I was soon asleep. :
"I am endeavoring to tell you every
thing, Mr. Holmes, which may have any
bearing: on the case, but I beg that you
will question me upon any point which
I do not make clear."
"On the contrary, your statement is
singularly lucid."
VI come to a part of my story now
in which I should wish to be particu
larly so. lam not a very heavy
sleeper and the anxiety In my mind
tended, no doubt, to make me even less
so than usual. /About 2 in the morn
ing; then, I was awakened by some
sound in the house. It had ceased ere
I was wide awake, but It had left an
Impression behind it as though a win
dow had gently closed somewhere. I
lay listening with all my ears. Sud
denly, to my horor, there was a dis
tinct sound of footsteps moving swiftly
in the next room. I slipped out of bed.
all palpitating with fear, and peeped
round the corner of my 'dressing-room
door.
"'Arthur: 1 I screamed, 'you villain!
you thief! How dare you touch that
coronet?'
"The gas was half up, as I had left
it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only
in his shirt and trousers, was stand
ing beside . the light, * holding the'
coronet in his bands. He appeared to
be wrenching at it, or bending- it with
all his strength. At my cry he dropped
it from his {jrasp and turned as pale
as death. I snatched it up and ex
amined it- One of the gold corners,
with three of the beryls in It, was
riilssing. - : ..*i^
tou blackguard!' I shouted, beside
myself with rage. 'You have destroyed
It! You have dishonored me for ever!
A\ here are the jewels which you have
stolen T .'. â¢ '
"'Stolen!' he cried.
"'Yes, you thief!" I roared, shaking
him by the shoulder.
" 'There are none missing. There
cannot be any -Isslng,' said he.
" 'There are three missing. And you
know where they are. Must I call you
a liar as well as a thief Did I not see
you trying to tear off another piece?'
"'You have called me names enough,'
said he; 'I will not stand It any longer.
I shall not say another word about this
business since you have chosen to in
sult me. I will leave your house In
the morning and make my own way in
the world.'
"-'You ' shall leave it in the hands of
tne police!" I cried, half mad with grief
and rage. "I shall have this matter
probed to the bottom.'
.' "'You shall learn nothing from me,'
said he, with a passion such as I should
not have thought was in his nature. 'If
you choose. to call the police, let the
police find what they can.'
"By this time the whole house was
astir, for I had raised ray voice in my
anger. Mary was the first to rush into
my room, and, at the sight of the coronet
and of Arthur's face, she read the whole
Etory. and, with a scream, fell <*S wn
senseless on the ground. I sent the hcvfc-e
maid for the police, and put the inve.%l
gation into their hands at once. When
the inspector and a constable entered the
house Arthur, who had , stood sullenly
wilh his arms folded, asked. me whether
It was' my Intention to charge him with
theft. I answered that It had ceased to
be a private matter, but had. become' a
public one, since the ruined coronet was
national property.! I was determined that
the law should have its way in every
thing.
"'At least,' cald he, 'you will not have
me arrested at once. It would be to your
advantage as well as mine if I might
leave the house for five minutes.' -
"That you may get away, or. perhaps
that you may conceal what you have
stolen." said I. And then: realizing the
dreadful position in which I was placed,
I Implored him to remember that not only
my honor, but that ot one who was far
greater than I was at stake; .arid that
he threatened to raise a scandal which
would convulse the nation. He - might
avert it all if he would but tell' me. what
he had done with the three missing
stones.
"'You may as well face the matter,'
said I; 'you have been caught in: the act,
and no confession could .make your guilt
more heinous. If you but make such
reparation as is In your. power, by ..telling
us where the beryls'are, all khali be for

at ' great risk, .to your \u25a0 dressing-room;
opened your bureau, took out your coro
net, broke off by main force a small por

concealed three gems out of ' the' thirty
nine with such skill that nobody: can find
them, and then returned with the other
thirty-six into the room in which he -ex
posed himself to the greatest; danger of
being discovered. .1 ask you now, is such
a . theory.; tenable?"
"But what other is there?" cried the
banker, with a gesture of despair. "If
his motives were innocent, why. docs he
not. explain them?" ;c; c /
"It is our task to find that out," replied

already! spoken to me, and Inquiry showed
it was !so. 5 -I passed ' round the garden
without' seeing anything .more than I ran
dom tracks, which I took to be' the police:
but ' wh*n I . got , into the . stable â¢ lane a
very long and complex story was written
in the ; snow , in front ; of me.
"There was a double; line of "tracks of
a booted man, and a second ; double line
which I .saw with -delight belonged to . a
man with naked feet. I was at once
convinced from what you told me that
the ' latter was your. son. The first had
walked both ways, but the .other had
run swiftly, and, as his tread . was
marked in places over the depression of
the boot. It was obvious that hs had
passed after the other. I followed them
up, and found that they led to the hall
window, where Boots had worn all the
snow away while waiting. Then 1
walkod to the other end, which wa3 a
htindred yards or more down-, the lane.
I; saw where Boots had faced round,
where the ground was cut up as though
there ' had been a struggle, and, finally,
where a few drops of blood had fallen,
to show me that I was not mistaken.
Boots had then run down the lane,' and
another little smudge of blood showed
that it was he who had been hurt. "When
he came, to the high road at the other
end,. I found that the pavement, had been
cleared, so there was an end to that clew.
VOn 'entering the house, however. I ex
amined, as you remember, tha sill and
framework of the hall window with my
lens,- and I could at once see that some
one had passed out. .1 could distinguish
the outline of an instep where the wet
foot had been placed in coming in. I
was'then beginning to be able to form
an opinion a3 to what had occurred. A
man had waited outside *. the window,
some one had brought the gems 7 the
deed had been overseen by -your 'son. he
had pursued the \u25a0 thief, had struggled
with him, they had each tugged at the
coronet, their united strength causing in
juries which ncuaer alone could have
effected.-' He had returned with the prize,
but had left a fragment in the grasp ol
his opponent. So . far I was clear. The
question now was, who; was the man,
and -who -was "it brought him the coro
net?."-'/ \u25a0'- \u25a0"."*â¢"\u25a0\u25a0. v _;.:';'".'-' ."'â¢'. \u25a0;;
\u25a0-' "It 1 is an old maxlm^oi mine that when
you have excluded : the impossible," ,whatr
ever 1 remains, however improbable, must
be the truth. "'Now, I knew that, it was
not" you "who had brought', it .'do'wn^ so
there only remaineu your- niece and the
maids. , But if It were the maids, why
should your son allow himself 'to be ac
cused' In their place? "There could be no
possible reason. A"s he loved his cousin,
however, there- was" an excellent explana
tion why" he should retain her secretâ
the more so as the. secret was a disgrace
ful \ one. When I remembered that you
had seen her at the window 1 , and how
she had fainted on ' 'seeing ) the coronet
again, my Conjecture became a certainty.
â¢ "And .who ', could" It be ' who was her
confederate? A lover evidently, for who
else -could outweigh the love and grati
tude which she" must feel to you? I
knew that you 'went out little,' and that
your circle of "friends was a very limited
one. \u25a0 But "among \u25a0 them wa3 Sir ',George
Burnwell. I had heard of him 'before as
being a man of- evil reputation among
women.' It must have been he who wora
those boots and retained the missing
gems.. Even though he* knew that Ar
thur ; had him,* he might still
flatter himself "that he was safe, for tho
lad coulu not say a word : without com
promising" "his own family. <"
."We..;: your own good sense will sug
gest what measures I took next. I went
in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's
house, managed to pick up van' acquain
tance .with his valet," learned 'that hla
mastÂ«r had cut' bis head the night before,
and. finally, at the expense^ of six shill
ings. : made all ;sure by buying a pair
ofhis cast-off shoes. With'these I jour
neyed-down to Streetham.-an- saw that
they exactly.: fitted the; tracks."
' "I " saw an" ill-dressed;, vagabond in the
lane yesterday evening." said Mr.'Homer.
"Precisely.; It- was LI found that I
had- J my '-'man, so I- came", home" and
changed my clothes. "It was a delicate
part which I had to play then, for I saw
that -a" prosecution must be avoided to

a villain would see that ' our hands were
tied in â¢ w.e matter.' I went and saw him.
At '\u25a0 first, of course, he denied everything.
But: when 1 I gave him every particular
that had occurred, he tried to bluster,
and took down a' life-preserver from the
wall. I knew my * man,* however, - and I
clapped ia . pistol -to â¢ his ! head before " he

more! reasonable. I told him that we

BEFORE beginning a de*cription of
the fine table linen that is seen
to-day on the tables of the rich
families of our society, it will be
interesting to consider the history
of Unen and to understand exactly what
It la. Although it is universally used to
day for clothing as well as for the table,
there are probably but very few people
who are familiar with the Interesting his
tory of this commodity nor how it is
Of course every one knows that it is
made of fmx, but as a general thing that
is about the beginning and the" end of
the knowledge that -we possess on the
subject.
I have recently had a very interesting
conversation with a manufacturer of
lintn. who came here from Ireland and,
with the happy faculty that Irishmen
have, he nude the subject so interesting
tnai he iic.u my attention much longer
than 1 wuu.ii liuve thought it possible.
tie described to me me immense care
witu v. inch the Irish farmer selects his
t-t iv. and with what pains he watches
anti uncs its growth â and he portrayed
lv me in growing terms what a beautiful
bignt tiie liowtiing; ilax is. The flower is
an exquisite shade of blue, and the Held*
of iliix frequently cover many acres.
The .liowers la.it but a short time, how
ever â 1 think he t-aid only about two
weÂ«ktâ and then they fade and; drop off,
leaving only capsules full of se*ds.
Fiaxsttd ig a common article in every
family, familiar as household words, and
almost every one has had some experi
ence with * flaxseed poultice. But a. flax
seed potiltjce is very different- resultant
from the plant from, fine table linen,
which is made from the outside fiber of
the plant.
That nber must be pulled off. and the
task of "pulling" must bÂ«, from the. de
scription, an arduous one. requiring not
only hard work but unlimited patience.
In the first place the work has to be
Â£Â£*& on a fine day, when the greatest
*si> and attention must be given to it.
All the stems cf the plant must be select
ed and piled together according to their
length.
Fancy going through* a wheat field and
picking the heads of the wheat and then
assorting the stem 6, putting together
those of the same length! It would seem
to represent an almost endless task.
Uy Informant then wÂ«nt on to tell me
of what he called "rippling" the flax, and
the subsequent watering of it, a process
that requires a fortnight or so to com
plete.
Generally the flax is watered in a
stream or river near the fields. The
water in which flax is soaked becomes
so fu!l of the poison of the plant as to
kin. the fish that may be in the stream.
But on the ' other hand it absorbs all
the nourishment that- the.- plant- has
taken vp from the earth In its growth
and It becomes a liquid manure of great
strength. In that condition it is spread
cpon the fields,' restoring uncommon vigor
to the exhausted soil.
These details, proved very interesting:
fliTl inspired sentiments of respect for
xny linen dresses and skirts, especially
when . my informant went on to explain
farther that it required another fortnight
to dry and bleach the plant in the sun.
In this latter process each piece must be
takes up and turned over every few
days so that the bleaching, may come
out even.
--The Sax has then to, be broken and
\u25a0^KSitcsed." whichT may be done cither
toy znacijne or by" hand. The hand
scotched. flax is mucli more expensive
than that scutched by machine. ~
The process of weaving seemed very

The Story of
Table Liner
- - - - - . - .
I confess to a weakness for fine linen
that has always impressed me. although
In a state of complete ignorance as to
"rippling" and "scutching," and stem
ming and all the other processes neces
sary io bring it uron our tables. And'
nowhere is linen so much exposed to crit
icism as on the table. It is a very essen
tial" part of the dining-table, where fine
iimn is always handsome and much ad-;
mired, and coarse or uneven: linen is ah V
exponent; of grave housekeeping defects. l'
In these later years the/ patterns^
which are woven In table linen- are* so
pretty and artistic that there seems to
be no excuse for an ugly tablecloth.
But of course the quality
also. Good linen, if more expensive In
the beginning, is the most economical
in the end. as it- wears so much better.
Very elaborate tablecloths are much
ii\ fashion now. In fact, everybody
must have noticed how much more or
nate they' are now than they were a
few years ago. A monogram, and some
times even a motto, is woven in on each
side of the centerpiece and on each
napkin. This has been done for quite a
long time In Paris. I dined with an
American woman-there a few years ago
and remember noticing that her table
cloths and napkins all had her mono- *
gram beautifully embroidered on /the
cloth.
Mr. Samuels told mo that a .great
many ladies were having their table
sets made in this way.'
The manufacturers of linen some
times make, for their'own gratification,
table linen of some elaborate or freak
ish pattern, not with any expectation of :
selling it. but as an advertisement or
display, card. . . \u25a0". ..
I saw one of these at the Lace I^ouse.
and was Informed that there were only
six like It In the" world. I was gratified
to learn that fact, because.lt was.cer
tainly not. a pleasing, design, and Its
grotesqueness did not seem to me a suf
-flclent excuse- for its -being.-
It was made of unbleached linen,
which Is a queer coffee brown color
and not attractive, and .the' pattern, of
.which. l attempt a description, was sin
gular enough.
The.centerpiece represented the sun
and the sun's rays. Around this were
designs of . all the â Erigllsli colonies.
The photograph 5 may - help i to; give some
idea of it, but I cannot Imagine tho
most enthusiastically^loyal^of;English
men desirous of; possessing it..
Apropos of ; freak patterns on table
linen, I am reminded of a rather amus-,.
Ing ..experience ; that happened to a
friend of-mine. A linen peddler came
to her. door offering. to sell 'fine -linen
cloths at a very low figure,' and, llko
most, good .housewives, she wiis eager
to see his- stock.
. Finding /a tablecloth which her. ex
perienced eye showed . her to be
beautiful-, quality, and' then â¢â¢ learning
that the price was singularly low,, she;
-bought the treasure, without paying:
any. attention to the design of the, pat
tern.- Bat later- when she spread ;the =
tablecloth out to be admired " by: .; tier '

A table dressed in blue as the domi

-than any other color., especially, for

: preservation of linen is of. the
very greatest ' importance and a great
factor. In it is the washing.
'-:-. Captain Douglass, who has charge of
the linen of .the Palace Hotel, gave me
some figures" that were startling. jHo
said that the linen kept in stock in thÂ«
hotel amount to J3500. ThÂ»y have 1000
tablecloths. 6009 napkins and 1200
"tops." ; He . explained the meanln; of
the. Word "tops" by saying that 'when
a tablecloth was soiled a top. or smaller
cloth, is laid over It instead of chang
ing the whole cloth.
Their table linen is bought -in Bel
fast and sent on direct from the fac
.tory there, saving in that way a very
. large amount of money. They hava
their own special pattern and the linen
is of excellent quality.
I suggested to Captain Douglass that
great care should be taken In the wash
ing of such an expensive outfit of linen,
and he answered that ."it was all in the
washing," and that he believed that tha
pains he took with the washing saved a,
large sum 'yearly to"; the hoteL HÂ«
added that, of course, he could not taks
as muchpalns with It as he would like
to, for. want of time, but he took car*
that" the ; linen should be given a con
siderable time to rest after coming from
Ithe laundry before it .was used again.
"While the linen is damp or warm the
threads are ~ apt to break and thus the
cloth is sqon.worn out.
' It *is .most Important, too, that the
linen 'should be thoroughly ; rinsed and
every bit" of the soap taken . out of Itâ
.otherwise it soon gets a dirty. ; stained
look .that cannot .be washed out. .And
it must be 'thoroughly T dried,' as a great
deal'depends on drying It thoroughly..
Captain * Douglass thought " It "would
be a,good_idea to buyj an . acre : or â¢ twÂ«
of grass \ land : In the country,' whÂ«n' he *
could have . his . linen spread out to be
al#ed "and sundried every: week.' "He

thtt such mta are UkÂ« a civilized maa

To keep Â«Jlv%, to have lacaenee, hÂ«
xnast prelead tÂ» accept tha savage
polat of view, must pretend to disre
gard fcls own knowledge and Intelligent
methods, must play the . frame of life
with the eru4Â«. dumzy counters of
oast* and custom and creed and thought
which the savages regard as fit and
proper. InttUlgest mÂ«n of action do
tee as clearly as the philosophers; but
they have to pretend to adapt their
xaeat&l vltlon to that of the mass of
their fellow men or. like tha philoso
phers, th*y would lead lives of profit
less laactlon, enunciating troths which
are of no value to manklad until it
rediscovers them for itself. No man of
trained reasoning power could fail to
see that the Golden Rule is not a piece
of visionary altruism, but a sound prin
ciple of practical self-interest. Or.
could anything be clearer, to one who
takes the trouble really to think about
it, than that ho who advances himself
at the expense of his fellow men does
not advance, but sinks down Into the
class of murderers for gain, thieves,
find all those who seek to advance
themselves by injustice? Yet so
feeble is man's reason, so near to the
brute -is Â« he, so under the nils
of brute appetites, that he can
cot thick beyond the Immediate appar
ent good, beyond to-day's meal.
I once e&ld to Scarborough: "Politics
is the science and art of fooling the peo
ple."
"That is true, es far es it goes," he
said. "If that were all. Justice, which is
osly another name for common sense,
would soon be established. But. unfortu
nately, politic* is the art of playing upon
cupidity, the art of fooling the people
Into thinking they are helping to despoil
the other fellow and will get a share of
the ewsf." '
And be Â«as right. It is by subtle ap
peal to the secret and shamefaced, but
controlling, appetites of men that the
clever manipulate them. To get a roan to
vote for the right you must Bhow him
th*t he is voting for the personally profit
able. And very clow he is to believe that
what is right can be practically profitable.
Have not the preachers been preaching
tb* reverse all thefct years; have they not
been insisting that to do right means

It was In my second term as Senator,
toward the middle of it. 1 was speaking,
one afternoon, in the defense of a meas
ure for the big contributors, which the
party was xorcing through the Senate in
face cf fire from the whole country- Per
sonally, I did not approve the measure.
It v/fes a frontal attack upon public opin
ion, and frontal attacks are as unwise
fend as unnecessary in politics as In war.
But the party leaders in the nation in
sisted, and. as the move would weaken
their hold upon'tne party and so ira
prove my own chances, I was not deeply
aggrieved that my advice had been re
jected. Toward the end cf ,my speech,
aroused by applause from the visltore'
gallery, 1 forgot myself and began to
look up there as I talked, instead of ad
dressing mytelf to rcy fellow Senators.
The tjes of a Epeaker always wander
over hie audience in search of eyca that
respond. My glance wandered, uncon
sciously, until it found an answering
glance that fixed it.
Tiils answering glance was not respon
sive, nor even approving. It was the re
verseâand, in epite of me, it held me. At
first it was just a pair of eyes, in the
shadow of the brim of a woman's bat, (be
rest of the face, the rest of the woman hid
by those in front and on either side. There
â¢was a movement among them and the
whole face appeared â and I stopped
thort Sn my speech. I saw only the
face, really only the mouth and the
eyes â the lips and the eyes of Elizabeth
Crosby â an expression of pain and of
Pity. .. .
I drank from the glass of water on
my desk and went on. When I ven
tured to look up there again the face
was gone. Had I seen or imagined?
Was it ehe or was it only memory sud
denly awakening and silhouetting her
upon that background of massed hu
manity? I tried to convince myself
that I had only Imagined, but I knew
that I had seen."
Within meâ and, I suppose, within
every one else â there Is a dual person
ality; not a good and a bad, as is so
often ehallowly said, but onÂ« that does"
and another that watches. Tha doer
seems to me to be myself; the watch
er, he who stands, like an Idler at the
rail of a bridge, carelessly, even in
differently, observing- the tide of my
thought and action that flows beneath.
â who is he? Ido not- know. But I
do know that I have no control over
him â over his cynical smile, or his lip
curling in good-natured contempt of
me, or, his 6hrug at self-excuse, or his
moods when he stares down at the
fretting stream with a look of weari
ness so profound that it is tragic It
was he who was more interested In the
thoughtsâ the passion, the protest, the
defiance and the dreadâ which the
sight of that face set to boiling within
me. Sometimes bA emlled cynically at
the turmoil, and at other times he
watched it with what seemed to ma
bitter dlEguÃt and disappointment and
regret-
While this tempest was struggling
to boil over Into action Carlotta ap
peared. She had never stayed long at
Washington after the first winter; she
preferred., for the children and'per
haps for herself, the quiet and the
greater simplicity of Fredonia. But
"I cot to thinking about It," said she,
"and It seemed to me a bad Idea* for a
man to be separated so long from his
wife and children â and home influ
ences."
That last phrase was accompanied
by one of her queer shrewd looks.
. "Your idea is not without" merit," re
plied I judicially.
"What arc you smiling atr* she de
manded sfi&rply.
"If It was a smile." said' l, "It was at
myself."
"No. you were laughing at me. You
think I am Jealous/tMRgOSfS
rof what?. Of whom?"
She looked fixedly at me and anally
said: "I want to tell you two things
about myself and you. Ths first Is that
I am afraid of you.**JgHÂ«
".'^yr, said L;
I don't know/'., she answered. â¢
"And the second 'confession ?"â¢"
"That I. never trust you?".
"Why?" .
"I don't know."
"Vet you are always telling me I am
cold."
She laughed " shortly. "So is a stick
of dynamite," said she. .
She stayed on at Washington. .

He seated himself and- ran his fingers
up and down his temples and through his
wet hair that was being so rapidly thin
ned and -whitened by the struggles and
anxieties of his ambition- *"My Ood!" he
cried out. "how I am punishedl When 1

pacing the floor again. "Governor!"â and
he laughed in wild, derision.

might have been; and rejoiced that I had
had- my mother with me and in me to

"Come, come,' Burbank." ; said I.
"you're not yourself: you've lost sleep â "
"Sleep!" he interrupted, "I . have not

CHAPTER XIL
Burbnak Fires the Popalar Heart.
That was," Indeed, a wild'; winter at ths
. State capitalâ a "carnival of corruption."*
_ the newspapers' of â¢ other States called it.
[One Toff the; first "of the '."black: bills" to
;go"throuÃh was a disguised street railway
urab. out of which x Senator ' Croffut sot
a handsome .''counsel ;fee".-.of ; fifty-odd

inn. And. If I am re-elected, I've got a.
Zikhl chance for the. Presidential nomina
tion. Should I get it and be elected, we
could form a. combination that would in
terest you, I thinK."
It Â»r^ a. beautiful irony that in his con
ctit he should give as his reason why I
should help him the very reason why I
was net sorry he was to be beaten./For,
although he was not dangerous, still he
was a. rival public figure to Burbank ; in
ovr State, anaâ well, accidents sometimes
happen, unless they're guarded against.
"What shall. l do?" I asked him.
"Stop them from passing any .more
black bills. Why. they've got -half a
Cozen ready, some of , them worse' even
than the two they passed over Burbank's
veto, a week ago."
"For Instance?" -
He cited -three Power, Trust bills. V
"But why don't you stop those three?"
said I. "They're under the special pa
tronage of Dominick. You have influence
with him."
"Dominick!" he groaned. "Are you
cure?" - And when I nodded emphatically.
he went on: "I'll do what 'l can, .but â "
He threw up his hands.
He -was oS for the .West that night.
When he returned his face wore the look
of doom." He had always posed for the
benefit of the galleries, especially the
women In the galleries." But now ihe be
came sloven in dress, of ten \u25a0 issued forth
unshaven, and sat sprawled : at his desk
in the Senate; his chin on his shirt bosom,
looking vague and starting when any one
spoke to him.
Following my advice on the day when
I sent him away happy. Burbank left the
capital and the State Just before the five
worst bills left the committees. He was
called to the bedside of his wife who,
so all the newspapers announced, was
at the point of death at Colorado
Springs. : .
While he was there nursing her as she
"hovered between life and death." the
bills were jammed through the Senate
and the Assembly.
He telegraphed the Lieutenant Governor
not to sign them, as he was returning
and -wished to deal with them himself.
He reached the capital on a Thursday
morning. sent the bills back with' a.
"ringing" veto message, and took the
late afternoon train for Colorado Springs."
It was as good a political "grand -stand
play" as ever thrilled a people.' -
The Legislature passed the bills over.
his veto and adjourned that night.
Press and people, without regard to
party lines, were loud in their execra
tions of the ''abandoned and shameless
wretches" who had "betrayed the State
md had covered themselves with eternal
nfamy.*' I quote from an editorial in
.he newspaper that was regarded as my
personal organ. But there was only
praise for Burbank: his enemies, and
those who had doubted his Independence
and had suspected him of willingness to
<la anything to further his personal am
bitions, admitted that he had sho.wn
"'fearless courage, inflexible honesty, and
the highest ideals of private sacrifice to
jublic duty." And they eagerly exagger
lted him, to make his white contrast
more vividly with the black of the "sa
tanic spawn" in the Legislature. His
fame spread, carried far and wide by the
sentimentality in that supposed struggle
between heart and conscience, between
love for. "the wife of his bosom and duty
to the people.
Carlotta. who like most women took
no interest in politics because, it lacks
"heart-Interest." came to me with eyes
swimming and cheeks aglow. She had
just been reading about. Burbank' s hero
ism.' - .
"Isn't he splendid!" she cried. "I al
ways told you he'd be President. And
you did n't. believe me."
"Be patient with me. my dear." said
I. "I am not a woman with seven-league
boots of intuition. I'm only a heavy
footed man."
Roebuck * Co.-PaÂ». Under the Yoke.
And now the stage had^ been reached
at which my ten mutinous clients could
be. and must -be, disciplined.
As a first step. I resigned the chair
manship cf the State Committee and or
dered the election of Woodruff to the
vacancy- I should soon have substituted
Woodruff for myself, in any *event. I
had never wanted the place, and had
taken It only because to refuse It would
have been to throw away the golden op
portunity Dunkirk so unexpectedly thrust
at me. Holding that position, or any
other officially connecting me with my
party's machine, made me a target; and
I wished to be completely hidden, for I
wished the people of my State to think
me merely one of the party servants. In
â¢sympathy with the rank and file rather
than with the machine. Tet, in the
chairmanship, in the targetship, I must
have a man whom I could: trust through
and through; and. save Woodruff, who
was there for the place?
When my resignation was announced,
the independent and the opposition press
congratulated me on my s high principle
In refusing to have any official connection
with the machine responsible for such In
famies. When Woodruffs election was
announced it came as a complete sur
prise. Such of the newspapers as dared,
and they were very few, denounced it as
infamy's crown of Infamy; and; the rank
and ' file of the party \u25a0 was shockedâ as 1
Had known it would be. He made : not a*
murmur, but I knew what must be in his
mind. I said nothing until six weeks
or two months had passed; then I went '\u25a0
straight at him.
"You "are feeling bitter against me.'.'
said I. "You think I dropped out when
there was danger of heavy firing, and
put you up to take it."
"No. Indeed.; Senator." he protested,,
"nothing like that. Honestly, I have not
had a- bitter thought against you. I'm;
depressed/simply because. Just as I had a
chance to ;get on my feet again, they
won't let -me."
"But," I v rejclned, "I . did resign and
put you In ; myi place I didn't want to
take the fire and thought you could."
"And so I can," said lie. "I. haven't
any reputation'; to lose. I'm no worse off
than I was before. .Let. .'em do their
damnedest."
"Your jirrt campaign will probably; be a
failure," I went on.- "and. we day after
election, there'll be a shout, for your
head."
He shrugged his shoulders. "I'm en
listed for the war.': said he. "You're my
general. I go where you order."
I hope the .edings that surged up in me
showed in my face, as I stretched out my:
hand. "Thank you. Doc," said I.' "Andâ
there'? another side ; to' it- * It; isn't .all'
bIack.^BHOHBBQpVMPVI
â¢It Isn't black at all." he replied
stoutly.
. I explained: "I've wanted you to have
the place from the outset. But I shouldn't
dare give it to you except at a^time like'
this/ when 'bur party has done" so \ many!
unpopular, things that * one . more won't
count; an- .aere'B so- much' to -be;- said"
against ,us. so much worse* things than
they, can pocribly make out your, election/

knowing it I , heavily subsidized ; the â¢ op-;*:
position machine. ' Wherever/; It could? be;
done with safety "7 arranged. for/the trad
ing off of our 'legislative ticket for our
candidate for Governor.
Â»"The Legislature is hopelessly/ lost," . I
told Woodruff; "we must concentrate on
the Governorship. We /must? save â¢* what
we can." In fact.\ so overwhelmingly was
our party In the majority ' and Â» so ? loyal
\u25a0were Its rank and file that ilt was "only, by
the most careful arrangement,; of :weak
candidates and of Insufficient -campaign
funds that I was able- to > throw^ the Leg
islature to the opposition. Our (candidate
for Governor, /.Walbrookâ Burbank j, was
Ineligible ;to " a second â¢ successive 'termâJ

And, by- the way,. I saw to "it -that; the
party organs gave Woodruff enthusiastic

had looked like utter ruin.* / . ;\u25a0 v /

naturally made', him their agent ;\u25a0 for the
conveying of their .wishes an d their bribes
of â¢ one kind and , another^ to the national

'\u25a0 With such resources any man of good

mean only one weakness.
Throughout , his eight years of con
trol of our party it had had possession
of 'all the departments of the national
administrationâ except of the House of
Representatives -during the past two*
years./ This' meant the uninterrupted
and unchecked - reign of the : interests.'

however offensive to abstract justice,
still; has, as it seems to me, a practical
justice in it, and, at any rate,; must be
pursued so long as the masses of the

Amman's rights, whatever -they may be

; has "1 the ' Intelligence and the power to
compel./ But," for the sake of the nation,
for the upholding of civilization itself,
.these overpowerful Interests should
never be. given their: heads, should be
restrained as closely as may be to their
rights-^-their political rights." Goodrich
had neither the sagacity 4 nor the pa

matterâ to keep them within the limits
of decency; and discretion./ Hence the

(Continued \ Next Sunday.)May Sutton Who beats the World
at Tennis.
* . -r "*-t "k HAT I" exploded the
â¢* \ A I amazed* % yousg iromas,
y V/ "What! Hs THAT May
' Â«^ Button? Why." I didn't
know she was a child!** \u25a0
"She isn't," assured tie young xnaa
privileged pro tern, to carry her. parasol
and explain thir.gs.
"But look!" Insisted the young
woman, with the finality of the un
convinced disdaining argument, ,
The- amazed young woman, with a
perfunctory 'pardon me," hau in&eriea
a. fine shoulder betwixt my eye* and
the tennis court, electric with the
match ot the day â the ladles* singles
between May Suttoa and her sister,
Florence.
i The crowd was big- thougii the space
was small, .for a champion Is a cham
pion and the beloved of the world.
I hid taken some pains to comÂ© early
acd get a point of vantage without ac
tual usurpation, and â
Well, never mind-
The amazed young woman "did it
to politely that I really couldn't care."
And anyway, the voiced exactly tbe
public impression of . this wonderful
little Califomian girl who has Just
brought home the British tennis scalp
at her belt, and who wears as many
captured scalps besides as the biggest
blg-chief-Indian-man.
She to unquestionably looks the child
\u25a0when you see her on the tennis court,
racket in hand, in hot pursuit of the
flying ball, that all assurance to the
contrary leaves you as unconvinced as
the amazed young woman. Her short,
ctocky Â£grure in tbe exceptionally suit
able and service: Die short-dKiried. col
larless tennis costume, .white in al) Its
detail*, had the grace and elasticity and
unconscious freedom of a child in the
ewift action of the game, and as she
bounces like an India rubber ball In her
unerring plays you credit her with
sweet sixteen at the very most.
I tell her so as she gives me a firm
emphatic handclasp with her strong
brown right.
Her talk is like her tennis plnyiag â
full of snap, vigor and directness.
If it were not, this would have been
the interview that never was, for the
Hotel Rafael did all it could to make
It co.
I am prompt to tbe second ia keep
ing our appointment, for Miss button,
who is the pet of the hour on her vic
torious boine-com'ing; has engaged to
go yachting, and 1 must catch a train.
I trust air card to the office staff of
the Hotel Rafael and wait â five min
utes, ten, twenty, twenty-five, impa
tience and the time-table playing havoc
with my serenity.
"Has iliss Sutton sent any answer â "
It isn't necessary to g/j on. I . see
she has not. for there is my card, still
gathering tl:c dust of'the Hotel Rafael,
while the office staff of the Hotel Ra
fael is Sherloek-Holmesing the missing
price of a dinner through register.
ledger and till.
There Is but a- scant quarter of an
hour left, and that's why I have what
Myra' Kelly calls "a glad" when I. find
that Miss Sutton talks as she plays â
with decision and authority and di
rectness, straight to the point.
It takes more to make a champion
than, the single talent that is tested.
The metaphorical wreaths of laurel,
and the real and tangible loving cup
prizes and brooches and rings and
bracelets and necklaces are not won
by the single talent that is the gift of
the gods. They are won by the work
an d- pluck and persistence that make
the best of the single talent specially
bestowed.
In tbe making of every championâ
even of the sweet grirl tennis champion
in the once again laehionable game
there are certain qualities of character
that must go*wlth the special quality,
and May tiutton has them. .
She Is not merely a girl who happens
to be a- sensationally good tennis
player. â
On the contrary, she is a sensational
ly good tennis player because she hap
pens to be a most unusual girl with
exceptional qualities of mind and char
acter.
She is a daughter of the sunshine â
tweet, buoyant, wholesoarand refresh
ing, -with none of the feminine subtle
ties of the boudoir beauty.
She is untroubled by a vagrant
fancy, unhampered by "the fatal habit
of reverie." She simply hasn't got. ft
In her mental makeup, as nine out of
every ten young girls have.: to fritter
and dream the time away.
She is all action and concentration
and directness.
Her mind is alert, active, inquiring,
watchful, analytical, possessing all the
qualities 'that make one good at games,
and the want of which makes most
grirls poor at sanies.
TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE A FORTUNE.

day. Mr. Cartarct had been as

was so out of colts that she did not
even smile upon Jirnmie, the elevator
boy. When she found Billy Teller
waiting at the door she tried to pass
without speaking.
"What* the matter, girlie?" he asked,
as he caught up with her and fell into
"Do go'awny," she said crossly. "I
don't want ever to sjÂ»cak to a man
again."
'".N'ot even me?" demanded- Billy in
affected surprise "I'm not the head of

"Don't you ever be such a horrid

Florence
Thrale
Her speech is so direct it Is almost
laconic.
. She seems to have no more need of : .
the modifying- phrase than she has for
false iroves or tricks in the game she ,
plays fo decisively.
She takes -a laughing interest/in., the
amazed young woman who didn't. know
that May Sutton was ja.child,;and- says:
."It's because I 'v/ear such" a. -short '
skirt that people think that" >/.
I think not, remembering the buoy
ant figxre bouncing after, the ball..
"Do I still look itâ close up?" she
wants to know,
She Isn't, fishing for compliments.
-She isn't guilty of such coriversxtional
fol-de-rol. She -is demanding' the an
swer with clear inquiring* eyes of .boy
ish frankness, and I deliberate. The
attractive brown face that much hat- :
less outdoor life has brenzed'into a fine
even color, the yellowy-brown hair
parted in the middle, fluffing around the
brow and decorated the modish
bow of pink at the > back, -.the firm,
strong, beautifully muscled, stocky
little figure in the dainty /white frock
all say sixteenâ and I wonder at the
mental poise of sweet sixteen.
'â¢Well, Fm not," she says.
"Ytould It be a fair question to ask
how old you are?"
It is one of the penalties of celebrity
â and royalty â that the world may
share secrets like this. .
"I'm nineteen," she says without par
rying-.
And nineteen is young to beat the
world at anything.
I want -to know aboiit the; making- of.
a champion, of a young girl champion
who lias all the allurements i ' of luxuri
ous idleness and social life to resist.^
"We Dl&yed tennis at homeâ ln order
to have something to do."
"We" means the Sutton family -of
girls, who have won tennis prizes up
and down the State until the truth has
passed into a proverb that "it takes a
Sutton to- beat a Sutton"; .and "at
home" means the pleasant Sutton name
at Pasadena. â¢
"And you began,!' I inquire, "when
you; were about co high?" measuring
off an imaginary little May Sutton some
two feet hish^
"Oh. no; I didn't play until I was
about elevenâ and" when I was. twelve
I was awfully keen on. tennis and went
in for the, ladles' singles- in the South
ern California tournamentâ and was
beaten."
The little girl of twelve didn't relish
being . beaten, even though -it "was by
a Sutton; but she didn't retire ' ln cha
l*rin. Not a bit of XT She studied her
ov/n game, and tbe game that others
played. ;
She noted -her weaknesses and- their,
strength with a discernment and as-,
tuteness quite unusual in 'little girls of
twelve 'and. as she says in her -laconic
way:
"I tried. to strengthen my game." '
That firsit defeat was. I believe, the, only
defeat" In ladies' singles that May Sutton
has known, and she'has, ac they say In
the sporting world, "met all comers."
She has 'gone on "strengthening" her
game, -keeping an- unprejudiced eye. open
to her own faults and a most observing
one upon the excellences of crack players.
She . has played with confidence ' ln ; her
self, tut a vigilant eye on others, and she
has gone on winning, winning.-' winning
the championship of her own section of
the State, the Pacific coast championship,
.the National Championship. ; /-.- â¢
Then, having no more scalps to capture
at home, she repined with Alexander, and
studied the map.
There "was England and Irelahd-r-Eng

(Copyright. t904. c by. K. M.,WhltÂ«hÂ«Â«d.)San Francisco's Bargain Counter for
Babies
DO yon know that there Is In Ban
Francisco a bargain counter for
babies?
An exchange vrbere the com
modities are boys and girls T
Aa cgency for the distribution of chil
dren that will provide you with sons and
danghters cf aay age, Â«iÂ« zr.i complex
ion your need demands, to repair any
deficiency that may exist in your family
circle?
Sounds Knocking, doesn't It?
Yet it isn't; not in u.e least.
It is really a very "beautiful work; a
work of loving hearts and great unself
ishness, both on the part of the agency
that is the purveyor of bargain counter
babies, and on the parts of itsâ shall we
csll them its customers? *
It is one more proof that there is much
kindness and helpfulness and generosity
ia this complex old world of ours that
to cften we are Inclined to regard as
such a hard and cruel world.
This agency for the receipt and dis
tribution of children is the outgrowth of
a demand, the direct response to a great
*ndâ l was about to say crying need, but
1 must not be too explicit and scare off
possible patrons..
Miss Flint of the Associated Charities
tells me that in the State of California
alone there are SOOO dependent children,
5404 children that are public charges.
&OC9 little human creatures cast out
ziaked. shivering, helplees upon the high-
of life. under_ the leet of the hurry
ing/ striving., struggling." contending, self
interested throng of humanity.
Une of the most beautiful, chastening,
softening things in life is that In this
throng there are some .who slip out. as
watcheis by the \u25a0wayside, to rescue and
shelter and protect these little helpless
buman creatures until they, too, are
tiroug enough in limb and wind and wis
dom to enter the race.
Thoce who step aside perform a double
task: Tnejr put forth one hand to res
cue, they put forth the other to exact a
toll. Here and there one in the hurrying
throng sees that hand and pays the toll;
but for the most part self-interest makes
them blind. &nd they brush by.
There are so' many little castaways and
co few who pay tolls that the rescue
work must be done in a wholesale wayâ
and we have institutions.
. Experience has taught the whole world
that the institutional herding of children
is not a success; that you casnot get the
, best results by rearing children whole
. sale, like vast broods of incubator chicks.
The heart of the "doorstep" baby, to
tally unconscious that it has been de
prived of the coaraon birthright of spe
cial love and special care, puts out its lit
tle tendrils of longing and affection confi
dently.
The institution little boy or girl, how
ever csrefully and exactly classified, how
ever scientifically reared in batches, is
still a. nonconformist, is still an exacting
little individual demanding individual
* rightsâ an individual love and sympathy
and possessions and interests, and the
right to be an individual.
The older institution child, brought to a
reasoning, self-sustaining age by public
care, turns upon the world in bitterness
asd says:
"I want ldsfolks. I want a name. 1
want a home. Why haven't I got them?"
To remedy thisâ so far as it is in human
pewer to -remedy \u25a0 the human wrong
doings and misfortunes that make waif Â»â
this bargain counter for babies, .this
agency for the distribution â¢of - homeless
children, has been established. -'
Its regular and official title-is the Chil
dren's Agency for San Francisco and
Vicinity.
It is the go-between for homeless,chll
dicn and childless homes.
In a strangely ill-assorted world there
are mauy ut both, and the Children's
Agency a.!r.:s to be the hyphen to connect
tbcra.
On tfa o one sidP its field extends over
the entire State; ou the other it pro
vides for the charges In the _ many
charitable Institution devoted lÂ« chil
dren.

that are willing .to give a place and a
welcome toi one of them, the agency, on
the other hand apportions arid: dis
tributes the children In accordance
with the requirements, picking out the
"blue-eyed, golden-haired baby girl"..
demanded by one, "the strong willing
boy who will not tell lies" required by
another, the "da.rk-complected" little
girl or "the fair little boy that will
match the rest of .the family. -
This work of assorting and apportion- j
ing is not all, 4 however. Its chiefest
work is of Inquiry and supervision. ,
It runs a bargain counter for bable3,
but It is a very carefully guarded bar
gtiin counter. It rnns "a distributing
agency for children, but it Is a * very
watchful. Inquiring, exacting agency.
Do you want one of the bargain counter
babies for your, very 'own? '
Then you must- make a satisfactory ac
counting of yourself to the Children's
Agency; you must show that you are
financially able and morally fit to be {rust
ed with the care of a child, and you must
produce references to prove that you are.
And that Isn't aIL
You can't make a good showing, pick
up the baby you select and disappear into
the world with it, to do with it as you
please.
The agency, follows its bargain counter
baby into its new home, visits it from
time to time, watches" its condition and \
the treatment it Â» gets; and if. everything
is not satisfactory takes > back its baby
again. \u25a0 '/
This Is a very necessary precaution, for
It is not always generosity and kindli
ness-and the heart-hunger for .something
to love and care for that prompts the 'ap
plication for a child.
There are many base and sordid mo
tives that must be discovered and circum
vented.
There are those who want babies for
blackmailing purposes, for the securing of
property interests, for the furthering of
selfish, strangely wicked schemes. â¢ There
are those who want children for drudges,
and others, discordant husbands and
wives or unhappy women, who have "gone
to housekeeping" without the formality
of a marriage ceremony, who think to ce
ment the domestic ties by having a baby
in the house. â¢ , . â¢ ,
. These the agency, must detect and deny.
But these, of course, are incidental. *
Aside from them irrtre is still the legiti
mate demand and the big supply to' meet
li. the supply, unhappily, always exceed
ing the demand.
Nothing: can show better than Illustra
tion and example bow one meets the oth
er, how the Children's Agency does its
work and Trhct it does. '.'.,.\u25a0
There's the caseâ they .. are all "cases,**
these, little tragedies and dramas of child
liteâ cf the little three-montlvold boy
who was abandoned by his mother.. The
mother had come here carrying her baby
in her arms and "seeking the husband
who had deserted her. She left the : baby
with a woman to board while she ,went
on with bÂ«r search, working the while
for her own and the baby's support. She
paid $3 boaTdanU disappeared. The baby
was. kept, partly, as a. hostage, partly out
"of" kindness for two .months, -and- thenj
the desertion becoming, so-evident, was
taken out to f the, foundling asyiqm. on

. Just â¢ how fortunate some .of the little
c*es ! are can be gathered from this bit
.of 11133 ' McCarthy' 3 report to the Boys*
-and Girls*, Aid Society on the home found
for one Qf , its waifs.
All relations between the Children's
.^Agency, and the good people \u25a0 who open
their hearts and homes tn waifs are con
fidential, so I omit trie names of Willies
friends. . Willie, himself; whispered to
iUss McCarthy when she made the visit.
"Don't tell 'em my real name in town.
They call me Willie \u25a0- â here, Just the
same as the other children!".
This is Mis 3 McCarthy's oSSclal report,
under the heading of "remarks";.
..^Willie was - out squirrel hunting
-when I arrived at this home, and my
. first sight of him was when two ponied
came careering over the meadows, the
first carrying- a girl of 15. and the sec
ond a boy of about 12 (Willie), with a
little girl of 7 seated behind him hang
ing; on for dear life.
"â¢lira. â â is very much pleased with
the boy. and so is her . husband, who
was out after cattle, so that I did not
, see him. The house is a large, roomy <
one. The* ranch of 800 seres Is owned
by the -. The household consists
of three daughters-^-the eldest to be
married . soon, and the others aged 15
and ? â a son about 25 and a young girl
\u25a0whom Mrs. -is coaching for bu3t
" ness college,
"Mrs. - â â seems to be a woman of
fine character, and has taught school
a great deal. The two younger girls
are bright and Jolly, and the whole at-:
mosphere of the place is cheerful and
homelike. \u25a0 . .
."Willie does not look very strong.
but Mrs. i says he is gaining ' flesh
and strength. He says he is happy and
contented, and certainly looks so."
' Here is another small boy/Â» report
on himself. v He writes In a careful.
vertical hand, - with, an occasional slip
in ! spelling, and an enthusiasm that il
luminates the plain sheet:
VI like It op here very much.' Mrs.
_!_' plays the piano and Eddie plays
the harmonica. Easter Sunday we got
seventy-two more little chickens from
eight hens, and about a month later wo
got 205 little chickens. ,This Thursday
they wilt be one month' old. We haye t
three pigs and seveaty-nlne laying
hens. We had 100 laying hÂ«ns. but tho
wildcats got them. -The house Ufull
of books and papers. I have red cheeks
now. and I guess" I* will grow fast be
cause I drink lota of nice fresh milk

"I am getting along fine with Mrs. â "- T .-
I feed the little pigs behind tae barn
morning, noon and night. Mrs. â â
calls me Dickie and she U very
kind to me."
This isn't literature, perhaps, out
think of it!
"He's a little institution boy â and
"Mrs. â â calls me Dickie ."
The Joy of it thrills through the care
ful vertical writing â and it. make* as
-nothing all those detul,. gray Institution
years of -waiting, for a home and a
narneand folks of hi 3 own.
Mri, â â is his "folks" now.
is the letter that got Dickie out
of the Institution be was la. Mrs. â =â
has had several boys before Dickie from
the same Institution. One "of them is
married now, a decent, honest, prosper
ous young man of family, thanks to the
start she gave him, and another la still
on her ranch, working on shares. \ Here
Is the letter she wrote that brought
Dickie to her: -
\u25a0 ; . -iV want " a boy . between the ages . of
nine and twelve years; one who Is do
mestic .in his tastes and affectionate;
easy. for a \u25a0woman. to control; of good.
lHwri disposition; without parents; one
that I can -love and care for as my own
rhild. Eddie is getting to be snch a big
bey now that I fear hi 3 parents .will
take him away some day. That la the
reason that I would like a boy that has
,no parents, for I love Eddie 'and shall
very much dislike" parting with him."
To this wealth of hungry. love little-
Dickie.- who has no parents, was sentâ
" and you read Dickie's letter.

TALK. and ungainly, young and self
conscious, he walked Into ' the
crowded courtroom, fresh from
the law school, utterly without
advice or experience. His pale,
boyish features wore the flush of knowl
edge, but it was the painful knowledge
that every one was looking at him. Con
vinced that he was creating an unusual
Btlr among the old and staid lawyers,
the straight-laced bailiffs and the habit
ual hangers-on, he took a seat at one
of the broad tables and assumed that
posture of importance attained only by
extreme youth.
By his side was another youth, not over
sixteen, fair, ruddy cheeked and comely.
It may seem strangely coincident that
on the day Edward Gray first entered the
courtroom as a full-fledged attorney his
younger brother should be there as a
witnessâ a witness in a case wherein a
man was being tried for forgery. The
brothers had gone to the courtroom' to
gether, the elder leading the way with
the Importance of bis position, * the
younger following in some trepidation,
full of inquiry as to how he should act,
what he should do. With superior in
difference the attorney replied gruffly,
affording the earnest Interrogator but lit
tle satisfaction, no consolation and the
assurance that he was going into a place
where none but the greatest of men
could enter. Â«
When Frank Gray stepped into the big
courtroom for the iirst time in his life he
knew no more of its etiquette than if he
had been an untutored savage. His mag
nificent brother, upon whom he looked
with respect and awe. had told him noth
ing except that it was the home of jus
tice, of truth and of dignity. Little did
he know that the strutting attorney at
whose heels he tagged was filled with a
fear and trembling in comparison with
which his own was but a trifling flutter.
Ignorant as was the honest country lad,
raw from the district school, unlearned in
the ways of the gTeat city proudly known
as the county seat of a community whose
total population did not exceed 50,000, he
was not half so crude as the mighty
brother felt himself at heart. His dignity
was assumed, his importance the fruit of
a determined ambition, his superiority as
feeble in reality as the years which mark
ed his bare majority. But he assumed, he
acted all three with the desperation of an
unpracticed Intelligence; he distressed
himself with the wish that he could be
seen for all he was worth, that he could
display in himself all that had taken
others a lifetime to achieveâ ability. Such
Is youth.
The cause on trial was of considerable
prominence. A cashier, holding a respon
sible position In a large mercantile estab
lishment, had forged the name oÂ« a cus
tomer and had drawn the money, intend
ing to replace it and destroy the check
before discovery. His plans had gone
awry, and he was arrested. Frank Gray,^
the boy. was in t~e store when the ser
geant-of police served the warrant on the
lorger, and heard every word of the con
versation which passed between them.
He was subpenaed by the defendant, who
wished by him to disprove certain allega
tions made by the officer.
'The boy was alarmed at the prospect,
dreaming for nights before of the ordeal
through which he expected to pass on
that awful day when he faced the court.
His brother merely â and sharply â In
structed him to see that nothing but the
truth was toldâ "the .whole truth, and
nothing but the truth."
Tbe lad's honen, wondering blue eyes
had barely become accustomed to the
strangeness of his surroundings when he
was suddenly startled by hearing his
brother's name called out in the metallic,
rasping tones, of the court's voice:
"Any motions. - Mr.â Mr. â " (here the
court leaned over and asked the nearest
bailiff a question) "Mr. Gray?"
"None, yourâ your Honor," came the
wee. small voice of the mighty brother,
notwithstanding the ponderous effort put
forth to make the tones loud and firm.
"Then, bailiff, you may call the case of
the State vs. Royal."
The usual preliminaries were rushed
throusrh. the indictment read, and . the

"r-y XAMINATIOXS loom large in
school life, because they are
I t tests of progress. When the
' \ \u25a0 school year is at an end and
,^Â» you look back over its course,
as over a journey from one point to
another, the examinations stand*, out
in memory like milestones on the road.
In some schools there are weekly
tests. In others reviews come monthly,
and in nearly every school there are
half-yearly examinations which very
fairly show the work that has been
assigned and demonstrate the faith
fulness with which it has been done.
A student whose work is fairly well
performed every day, who never brings
half-learned lessons to a recitation,
who never shirks a task of accepts
help Instead of working out problems
lor herself, -. need have no dread of Cex
aminatibns. /They/, will take. care, of
themselves. But \u25a0* there are girls who
have - an easy way of slipping, through,
their tasks, who? are not at all"
thorough, nor diligent, and yet Vho
manage to j seem prepared when .they
are just the reverse, I* have known
opening statement made by. the prosecut
ing attorney before Frank quite under
stood what was. happening. Several wit*
nesses were introduced, examined . -and
cross-examined, proving the fact that the
signature was a forgery, and then the
police sergeant was called, to the stand. -
The'omcer was asked to ' detail; or 1 to
give in substance the conversation which
had passed between him and Royal, the
accused man. By this time young Gray
was deeply interested, his ruddy face the
picture of rapt' attention. He drank in
every word of the sergeant's story, ap-V
proving it as remarkably., accurate. In
fact, he could hardly comprehend- how. the I
man remembered everything so clearly:
His learned brother apparently, ignored
the case on trial, looking/over the pages
of a volume of -reports with . a very in
tellectual frown between. his eyes. <â¢
"You may state. Sergeant^ Greeting, if
possible, the exact reply, of the defendant
when you asked what cause required him
to secure the money at that' particular
time." asked the counsel for the State.
"You want me to give his very words?"
"Yes, sir; if you can." ,;
"Well, he said this: 'I just had to. have
$35 that night. I had been gambling and'
had to pay my losses or be kicked out of
the clubâ l belong to the Bear. Club.' "
Frank heard this statement with grow
ing wonder. He straightened up \in his
chair and allowed his astonished . eyes to
wander from the witness to the prisoner.

FRANK V. KINGTON
- - . \u25a0 - . Â« . - \u0084
f'xHE heraldic American weapon, the
J. protector of the 'citizen? the tare
guard of the nation, the great
equalizer of men; it places the
giant within tfce punishing: power
cf the 3warf.
It is to be regretted that no literature
is extant treating of this very important
American topic in a manner understand
able and salted to the needs of the be
ginner. There are a few publications on
the subject, but t^ese cater to the ex
perienced marksman and presuppose an
intimacy with the art. So. at the most
critical period cf the shooter's career, he
Is forlornly without even .a blot of ink.
Until the shooter has passed, with rough
experience, the danger point of
our truly beneficent weapon is a constant
threat and menace. This .danger is di
rected not only at the -shooter's asso
ciates, but at himself as well. Many who
might have made fine . shots have gone
abruptly before merely by looking down
ihÂ« barrel of an unloaded .gun.. Good
friends, too. have gone also. It is to
supply this literary deficiency to a de
gree that this article is intended; the
many abstruse probltms and contentious
questions will be avoided,' and the ex
pert, bearing in the higher circles of the
game, must keep shifting for himself.
The revolver is to be acknowledged the
most -difficult o* all firearms to be mas
tered. Rifle shooting is simplicity when
compared. Revolver experts take a short
step to the rifle; but. the converse is
r<?t. true of riflemen, they, must: begin all
over again. This may 6eem ." ' 6trarige,
though nevertheless true. And the reason
for this is, the rifleman applies his two
hands, one. of which steadies and corrects
the other; the revolver man must aim
and fire with one alone.
The general idea of results that may
be accomplished with the revolver is not
very complimentary to, this, very reliable
and' sturdy little shooting-Ircri.~~Host
think the revolver is a usele*s arrange
ment even on a full-grown man, at say, a
distance cf ten paces. This is gross in
justice wantofcly applied to' our snappy
little gun, But let it be understood briefly
in Us defense, that If tome one would
place dollar pieces tt fifty yards and
allow a club of experts to keep what
they hit, that some "one would' lose a
let of money before the day was over.
And if ther* is a mas in America who
cannot hit the ace of rpadts at ten
long strides, It Is bis own fault. \u25a0:
First, to state: TTbat a revolver 1Â» and
how to select It/* Second: "How is it
to be handed and fired?" with many
CLCUonings Interspersed.
The revolver Is a type of pistol, dif
fering primarily. In having a revolving
cylinder; hence the name. A pistol is a
sort of rifle, classified as such. So ire
have a relation between the revolver
end the rifle; the gist of which relation
Is & rifled firearm. Rifling consists- of
altercate grooves and lands throughout
the barrel. | A revolver is nothing more
cor less than a short rifle having a re
volving cylinder wherein arÂ» seated the
cartridges or ammunition.
\u25a0 ELECTING A REVOLVES.
In selecting your revolver It Is as Im
portant to know what to avoid as what
to value. Selection very often depends
upon intelligence, rejection and elimi
nation. And, primarily, in choosing
your weapon. 'look for defects even in a
brand new gun.
In the beginning of things never buy
a weapon of cheap manufacture. There
are many revolver* catchliy advertised
as "don't pay for J reputaUon,**"aa hon
est weapon at an lionest price," whose
chief virtues exist, only in ink. Shun
these as evil, for danger, lurks in every
inch of them. If you would enjoy your
eport. enjoy it safely. A first-class re
volver is the only. kind you are Justified
in using. No weapon can be too good;
a high-grade weapon." is never .cheap.
Then, again, allowing a cheap revolver
to be safe, they* are" .-certainly in
accurate. Where lies ' the . use in hand
ling an inaccurate weapon when ac-~
curacy is the thing striven for? It has
been said that experts use high priced
weapons because they are -fancy. Nbn-.
sense. Safety und accuracy are what
they pursue. lam personally acquaint
ed with every revolver man of note on
this, coast, but I do not know 'of one
who even owns, much less uses; a fancy
grun. '?3HPI
ii', perchance, you cannot; feel. 1 just!-.
ficJ In affording a high-grade gun, new,
by :;2l means select a second-hand
weapon of merit. I repeat, because of
its utmost importance, reject all. cheap
revolvers. There are but two high
grade brands of revolvers made rin
America; these are well established and
need not be named here
Use a hammer gun only; hammerless,
automatic . pistols, and double-action ? rÂ©^'
volvcrs are delusions, and snares." 'The
hammerless is a' covered donble-action,
and double-actions are' accurate iSipos-"
sib:! Sties. ThÂ« hammer, must be" raised
to full cock, leaving nothing: to do but
aim and pull the trigger. In a double
action the trigger , lifts , the ', . hammer
while sighting, your, ravolver, trembles
and 'twitches; and this absolutely, pre
cludes an aim. \u25a0. Many good revolvers
(for example, figure 2) are madewith
double-action devices; but; 1 these . are
used, entirely ; as single-actions; many
shooters remove the double-action part.
An automatic Is' fairly . reliable, but 'Is
cumbersome and , " unwieldy. .;. , The first
shot Is slow, to fire.: Afterjrard ltbe
comtt'a matterj of .unnecessary danger
and Is far; from- satisfactory. .Auto
matics ' are 'â¢ now" in '- the â¢ most embryo (of

Picking up the weapon for the first time
at the gunsmith's, open' lt and make ab
solutely sure it. Is -not loaded. If you do
not know how to open* the j gun, | get the
gunsmith to show you or" have him do It;
himself. He will think a great deal bet
ter of you than if ; you undertook to
wreck the whole Implement. Nothing an
noys a gunsmith so much as a prospective
customer putting his stock in trade out
of commission. In this gunsmiths are
somewhat peculiar people.- Further, an
old shooter is never backward about ask
ing Questions; gunsmiths know this; and
here we find the converse to be true with
the novice; gunsmiths know -this; also.'
So be an old shooter. and be respected.
Instead of being a matter of apprehen
sion.
Having the weapon open in your hand,
carefully inspect all the exposed parts
for- rust -and corrosion. Don't take the
gunsmith's word for Itâ not that he is at
all mendacious, but to be your own judge.
Then, carrying the weapon to the sun
light, hold a piece of white paper at the
lower end of the barrel "at an angle I re
flecting the light up through it, so that by
looking through : the â¢ other end you can
see the entire inside of the barrel with
great distinctness. Don't look through
the barrel dlreetly at th*. light, for the
intense - glare will preclude a .careful', in
spection, .but use the piece of paper as
suggested.' Notice carefully the "grooves"

Liiow why, and what to substitute

should know, furthermore, what
course of diet will correct stomach

rvhat to eat in hot weather, and
what will suppN fuel to the human

Making Money by Amusing Others
How to Manage Entertainments for the Childrer
and for Grown- Ups
Cynthia Westover Alden
Copyright. 183 S. lr A. S. BameÂ« & Co.
NO matter whether you are In the
country or not, about you some
where there are children. They
get tired of their own little ways
of amusing themselves and hail with
loud delight anybody who will play with
them. Why not make a business of this
"playing"? Don't call it play, call, it
"The Children's Club." The mother often
wants to be free from the care of the
children, yet she must know that they
are having the best of attention. The
club might meet after school hours
every day. If "business" demands it, or
it might meet only Saturdaysâ this, of
course, according to the wish of the
mothers.. -.. . .. : :-Vj,v: ; ':'
Every little youngster will want to be
long to a club like mamma. Have every
thing you can in the way of amusement.
As you are paid by the mamma for the
time devoted to this hour, make It a rule
that the children are so amused that
they will tease mother "to belong."
There will be no rest until he or she has
"Joined the club." Supposing you charge
r* cents . a week for each child.
If you have forty of them, that is more
than $10 a month. '
Teach them in these "play hours
whatever Is agreeable, of course, to the
mothers. Dancing is fun for them and
makes them graceful. Certain kinds of
gymnastics are possible. You will think
of many things to do. and what doesn t
come to you the children will propose.
The "club" takes walks, rides, spends
whole afternoons In the park, visits all
the museums, takes short trips to; the
beach Has natural history days, when
the children take their books with them.
It is wonderful how relieved mamma
is when ber children are at the "club."
She knows they are learning something,
and at the^ same time have what the
children call a "mighty good time."
Any one thus â¢ interested in children
coald enlarge her, business by going to
homes of the little ones who are 111 or,
convalescing. When, the sick child, Is
strong enough, members of the club
might be appointed as a visiting com
mittee to carry their good times over to
the little shut-in.
From this amusing of children one
certain woman I "have In mlrid~ worked
up a marvelous business in amusing
grown-ups. One of the mothers was
wondering one day what she could do;
to ' some, strangers that uer.
husband, had phoned he was bringing
to dinner! Our"; young friend set her
wits to work and helped the hostess out
She not ' only supplied \u25a0 a whole â o-
gramme for an evening, but made many
of the souvenirs. Now she always has
on hand dinner and luncheon cards, and.
often appears at the little affair as a',
guest, and "works'* the programme so
effectively that, though every one goes
home thinking he had a "most extraor
dinarily" pleasant evening,' he never
suspects that it was all outlined before
hand.
If It It a big affair, our entertainer
often takes all responsibility, sending
out Invitations from lists furnished, or
dering extra chairs, seeing to the ca- '\u25a0
terlng, etc; in fact, taking charge- gen
erally. If the hostess so wishes It; Cir
cumstances tell you what to charge..
One's .' services, I think, are always
worth \u25a0at least 60 cents an hour, in
cities you can charge more.
Incidentally, while stopping at a sum
mer hotel I found out that a pleasant
boarder, as I supposed she was,, .re-^
ceived her board and five dollars a week
besides for, making it . pleasant ; for the
other guests at; the 'house. Naturally,
It is not to be known that her services
are paid for. Such knowledge would
take much of the charm ; away from
the business. Of course,' she must be
a lady in every respect: She must have
tactâ a great dÂ»al of . it Often "mak
ing things pleasant" would drive* the
very best boarder away' from the place,
especially If he went there for quiet.-
Her duty is to find out what the" guests
would like and tell die host, so he can
help her carry out plans' for "their
pleasure. â¢
A leader is always needed In every
undertaking/arid it Is often hard work;
for the one who Is known as such.- Al- .
most everybody will follow, and have
a , good . time; but few would care ' to
suggest and carry <jut the entertain
ment. - â¢ \ -â¢ , > .
This young woman told me that,shÂ«
was In college, this year, to be her last,
and her ; vacations'" for the last four
years-had been spent in.' this way. \
Here is a suggestion for somebody;
may you profit by itâ it is a novel one
to me. , . .

WHEN you get out winter clothes
and pack* away summer ones
..,-\u25a0 in their places, the most com

PERHAPS the most popular of ' all
: entertainments,* . because suited
both to the slender and overflow-
ing purse, is the afternoon tea. It
can, with perfect | good taste, " be^any

For. the more elaborate and formal aft

of invitation to, all pone's- friends '\ have
been sent out ten. days in advance nam
ing a special ; day "and ; hour, -there are
certain s requirements 1 that are univer

If a large tea or "at home"; is given In
the ' spring :or summer, : common '< sense
and comfort . both dictate', the"/ admission '
of as much sunshine and outside light as
possible. : But in the winter the'^ays are
so short that (darkness ; comes 7 long be

would *; be very .awkward 1 , to^; : have .'the

When the Baby is Four Months Old
Do Not Allow Him to be, Kissedâ Flay With Him

Dr. Emelyn L. Coolidge
Copyright. 1303, by A. 8. Barnes & Co.
FOLLOWING "the normal develop
. ment of our baby,' we find ', him
at; the age of 4 months able to.
hold his head' erect 1 without sup
port. He now. begins to use bis hands
much better than', he has yet done, and
seems to ; have \u25a0 found the value of his
little thumb' when taking hold of objects.
Instead of moving his arms and hands
\ n . '"â¢ a \ perfectly,; aimless fashion he
now shows that" his brain is beginning to
control," to some' extent at â¢ least, his
m?m ?I ecn<;n ts. ; He .will, of ten grasp an at
tractive object/ and after looking at It or
putting it in his mouth, he will throw it
on^ the floor and expect some one to
pick it up' for hfm.
*^V*l en^ .'carrying /the baby about ; the
hous^ change ;hlm,"from one arm to the
:o: ot ne L? cc aslonally, so that If he wishes
to u 'Â°, h'Â» hands" each one of them "may
be exercised -equally. < In "after-years \it
will be: a great advantage to him, if he
: can -use one. hand as", well 'as the other.
; Frequently ..by Uhe," end of the j fourth
- month the" baby .will show signs' of , fear.
â¢ f - *J stranger (enters "- the 'â¢ room and at
tempts to take him,' he of ten'scream
: & n( ? : not ; . be T \u25a0 pacified -until his mother" or
nurse holds' himjin l her arms. It;is well
.1 t0 ".," accuatbm 1 babies to "the sight of
strangers, but let them ] get a ] little Ae'd
'to the , new, person . before allowing that
person to" hold the child.' :
' .-; So many: well-meaning people, rush "up
to a young â¢infant.* talk , nonsense in [ a
; loud L v ?Jce or cover ; him ';. with klsse3. no
â¢ wonder". thÂ« babyrÂ«icreams with fright. : ," .
v Never; under any circumstances allow
the baby, to be "kissed 'on the mouth.
-Tuberculosis", \u25a0diphtheria and . many other
dreadful diseases are "contracted. in .this
way. It is 'no "doubt "a: great temptation
to l , kiss a, sweet . little 'lnfant;; but ; * think
of his best} good. I and choose : the little
hand for, the ;careÂ»s. , V
"It is' an excellent plan t to â¢ let the baby

to play with a baby Is Just after his
morning nap. Do not allow him to be
tossed .violently ; Into the. air in order to
make 'him laugh 'and crow: remember
how tender and delicate a little creature
he Is, and be gentle when handling or
playing with him.
Dainty Baby Hampers
FROlt the mest attractive of baby
hampers, with its trays and con
veniences, .to home-mado affairs.
the main j thing to 1 bring out to
making a baby basket Is daintiness.
Some of the larger hampers tak* thÂ«
place of baby bureaus, as well as Â«Â«rv
ing for the nicest sort of [ basket, for
they have one tray after another nicely
fitted in the hamper, with a sort of well
under the trays and with* the top -.tray
formed Into divisions.
The usual hamper has a single tray.
Most of them come already; trimmed,
but they can be got plain and trimmed
at home. . \ . >
The "trimming" consists in lining,
usually with dotted swiss, gathered up
over a second lining of pale pink or blue.
For i this china silk Is the softest, most
easily arranged material, although ,thÂ«
inexpensive lawns are even more used.
There's a bow of ribbon stuck on some*
where," Just by way of expressing the de
light in. baby prettiness that every
mother feels. â¢ â¢_
. Baskets are to be had to suit almost
every purse, some of them already lined,
and some ready to be lined. .The plainer
shapes are usually finished with a deep
ruffle ; (of both swiss and color) on the
outside, with the rows of gathers, where
the ruffle is attached to the basket, con
cealed by a twist of ribbon. ~^BPOQi
Even a small clothes basketâ Just baby
lengthâ can be transformed by the aid of
a few yards of material into as dainty a
basket as a bu by need want. \u25a0
An occasional box is made/something
like a shirt-waist; bos. with a lid that is
set ; on - hinges, and tbe â¢ box * Itself fur-*
nlshed with rollers, and perhaps there's
a \u25a0 tray, in it. ., if the tuaateur carpenter
can â¢ fit , it. ijag^teay^wp^â KaÂ»BâB|
; . AVith a box there's no full lining. . ThÂ»
outside Is usually . covered with cretonne.
- of . ; a~- white ground. \u25a0 dotted with tiny '
flowers, tacked smoothly on. The lining:
â¢ may be , either of the cretonne or ."of -
lawn â¢ or dimity, laid as smoothly. \u0084:,\u25a0; \u0084,
.^Whichever you; get "(though." if money
has, to be considered, a box Is the least
expensive of all), it must be fitted. out
vWtth'a lot of little necessary things.
A soft little brush 'and tne most baby
ish apology for a comb you'll have 10 it;

RICH AMERICANS LEAD THE UNIVERSE
IN SPORT FESTIVAL ON SCOTCH MOORS
Slaughter of Grouse Merely IFurnishes, Pretext for
Diversions That Wealth Only Can Obtain.
Cousin of President Roosevelt Shoots Birds That Cost
Him the v Neat Sum of $3.25 Apiece; V
LOKDON, Sept 17.-Amertcans are this
3 ear Betting the pace, by raeson of which
tne grouse seasonâ that great annual fes
tival of fashion and sport for which Par
1-ameat adjourns and leaves the British
empire to run itselfâ will undoubtedly
pass into history as the most successful
ever known. By that one means the most
costly. Here grouse shooting, much more
than horse racing, has become the exdu
Â«lre pastime of the wealthy. And because
fashionable Americans have more money
than other folk and are more reckless in
spending It they have taken the lead In
the social carnival, for which the killing
of grouse merely furnishes the excuse.
It matters nothing to them that the birds
elarn by them and their guesta costs them
from flO to US apiece and can be boug-ht
la the market for a mere fraction of
theee rems. It is for the social eclatâ the
eistljieUon of bÂ«lng in tne iwun- taat tney
ungrudgingly pay the difference and con
elder that they get full value for their
money.
The ahoatlng season began on August
12 and lasts three months. During that
period It Is estimated that, directly or in
directly, on account of its grouse, $20,000,
000 will be expended in Scotland. Of this
sum $2,000,000 goes for the rental of moors
end shooting- rights, and the larger share
of the balance for entertainments, social
distractions and high living generally.
Still the expenditure which might be
properly charged to the shooting account
âproviding gillies, beaters, gamekeepers,
fiogs. guns, conveyances for guests, lunch
eons, etc.. is a heavy one. When to the
rental and running of .the mcors is added
the cost of the social diversions for which
the slaughter of the grouse furnishes the
pretext, each bird killed represents, at a
moderate estimate, an expenditure of $9.
AMERICANS PAY MOST.
Of course the Americans will achieve
the distinction of paying most for their
birds. In the aggregate the number of
Americans who have leased moors is
not larsje; yet they pay over $500,000
in rentals and will probably spend at
least five times that much in maintain
ing their reputations for generous hos
pitality and lavish expenditure. Taking
into account all their expenses during
the season It Is estimated that each
bird bag-gred on the moors they lease
will rÂ«aily cost them about 315. X If
or'y the rental and the actual expense
of t 'running: the moor" and tiie shoot-r
ing* are taken into consideration, each
bird would represent a, trifling expen
diture of $3 25 to $5 50 each. . J.- R.
Roosevelt eat 6 his birds at the lower
price. If Andrew Carnegie leased his
moors his birds would coEt him con
siderably over $S apiece upon the same
basis oi" calculation. Of the renters
â¢'Silent Smith" pays the most, while.
Colonel Payne, the Bradley-Martins,
Mrs. Poor and E. D. Jordan of Boston
are not far behind.
Mr. Roosovelt. who is a cousin of
President Roosevelt, has leased Arma
dale, in the county of Sutherland, at
55000 for the season, more with a view
to a full enjoyment of the sport than
to a social campaign. The lodge Is an
unpretentious one and not particularly
suitable for the entertainment of large
parties. There are 40,000 acres in the
Ehooting, which should yield abundance
of grouse, at least ten stags and va
rious quantities of ptarmigan, wood
cock, snipe, hares, etc. The total ex
pense. Including- rent and extra ser
vants for this place, will be not far
from $16,000, so Mr. Roosevelt's grouse
will cost him an extremely low price
as srrouse s*>.
Richard A. McCurdy, president of the
Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York, has taken Braeroy, In Inver
ness-shire, and will entertain some of
his intimate friends there during Sep
tember and October. Some rather large
parties may be conveniently taken care
ot at the lodge, as It has been nearly
doubled in sire since last year. There
are 20.000 acres of good moons, which
extend over the whole upper valley of
the Roy and the upper series of the
famous parallel roads of Glenroy. The
rent for this property is $SOOO. Based
upon the number of birds killed upon
this moor last year and excluding the
cost of Mr. McCurdy's entertainments
and other extraordinary expenses, each
bird bagged will cost him $4 75.
MRS. POOR'S COSTLY GOWNS.
Mrs. H. W. Poor of New York, who
recently has been staying at the Hyde
Park Hotel, has taken Alvie, In the shire
of Inverness. This Is an exceptionally de
sirable moor and as there are ample fa
cilities for a large number of guests Mrs.
Poor will make the most socially of her
Scottish outing. There are some 8000
acres, of land which offers what sports
men call "a well mixed bag." There are
grouse, snipe, duck, plover, roedeer, stags
pnd blackgame, besides 6almon and trout
fishing. The house contains fifteen bed
rcoms. three reception rooms, a billiard
room, nine servants' bedrooms, and all
modem conveniences. In addition there
are the usual kennels, stables, gardens,
etc. ; The quality cf the sport and the
superior residential facilities make this an
expensive Dlace and the cost of each
grouse, exclusive of the purely social
social side, will easily be $5. With the
social mixture added, 115 per bird is
rather under than over a correct esti
mate.
Colonel Oliver H. Payne will make No
ver, in Ross-shlre, the scene of that lav
ish hospitality for whlcn he Is famous
and can so well afford. Novar Is an ex
cellent sporting and residential estate,
with a large and handsome mansion and
extensive shootings, yielding all kinds. of
Highland game. Assuming that Colonel
Payne's grouse bag equals that which the
property yielded last year, his grouse will
cost him over, i $17 apiece, as his social
everts are of the most elaborate kind.
Besides the shootings which go with
the 21,800 acres belonging to the Beau
fort Castle estate of Lord Lov.att,
Henry W; Phipps has acquired ihe
grouse . moors and . deer forests known
as Boblainy, Convinth and Fanblair.
while J. S. Phipps has taken Gleiico*',
In all the Messrs. Phipps have lea -ted
63,000 acres, which,' however, showed a.
low yield of: grouse last year; In fact,
only aboul 2000 \u25a0 birds. But ; this was
more thanrnade up for by the number
of other same captured, 'which included
over 100 deer, 15,000 peasants, - 2000
partridges/. 1000 hares, 10.000 rabbits,
besides liberal quantities of .. black-

game, woodcock and teal. The rents
paid for these properties aggregate
fully $80,000, and the cost of entertalri r
Ing, etc., is estimated ;at twice that.
amount. The Phipps' grouse will be
valued at about 512 Â«4ch without addl
ing the cost of shooting gillies In the'
closed season, one of whom was mis
taken for a poacher by the young Mr.
Phipps In July.
i With Inverary Castle, which he has
, leased from the Duke of "Argyll, E. D.
Jordan of Boston has this year . about
16,000 acres of grouse moor, which
should yield something like 900 birJs
at a cost of $3 75 â¬ach, taking into con
sideration only the rent . of the property.
C W. Ogden "of New York has again
taken Achdalieu in Argyllshire. Last
year there were 1226 birds killed there
at a cost of $3 10 â calculated on the
same basis as Mr. Ogden's bag. There
are 25.000 acres of well timbered land,
mostly forest, In this shooting, and deer
are plentiful, sixty-two stags 'having
been killed last year. â¢-.-. ,= \u25a0.
i "SILENT SMITH'S" CAMPAIGN.
Andrew Carnegie has let . Inveran,: one
of his Scotch grouse moors," to Lewis D.'
Hall, who should be able to bag fully IDOO
birds at a cost of about $5 each. That
does not Include, social expenditures. Mr.'
Carnegie's grouse are expensive - because
of the many improvements which he has
made on his properties. Old sport-loving-
Scotsmen are disposed to criticize. Mr.
Carnegie for the extent of the* changes
which he is making. In consequence ,of
the Increased expenditure upon his es
tates It Is estimated that, Mr.. Carnegiels.

The Bradley Martins, have -again leased
the jrrouse moors and deer forests of Bal
macaan.. Lochletter, Abriachan arid Loch
Nfss. FYom this-. domain of 42.000 acres
there should be some 1200 grouse ' bagged
at a cost of $4 50 each, besides large num
bers of deer hinds and other game. The
social outlay will ralsp. the value of the
birds about $17 apiece.
James Henry Smith has under; his con
trol as tenant this year more acres*. of
grouse land than; any, other American/
These moors Include Phones, Dunachton,
Dalnavert,' Inchreach and Klncralgi They,
extend over some 80,000 acres and so plen

only the rent Is considered./ ."Silent
Smith's" social campaign this year though
will come high. Lady Cooper presides
over that department and each -.bird
would be able to pay the $5 annual .tax
upon armorial bearings and still have , a
net valuation of 115, should Mr. Smith
care'to adorn every grouse with a sep-
arate lordly crest. .. \u25a0 . - :
.The King honors only one of the
great social Highland fixtures with his

are three of s 'these affalrs-^one .at In

DWELLS OUR
EMBASSADOR
Mr. Reid Occupies
Home Fit^ for
Any King.
To Produce Its Charm-
Ving Effects Art and â¢
_ Nature Blend.
No Other Foreign Diplomatist
in England Is Nearly
so Well Housed.
Special CablÂ« to The Call.
LONDON. Sept. 16. â So far as toclal
splendor and luxury can be made to
contribute to diplomatic success. It .is
evidently Embassador Reid's- Intention
to spare no expense on Uncle Sam's be
half. When he secured Dorchester
House In Park Lane as a town abode,
a London paper said of it. "Afost of .us
would prefer It as a residence to Buck
ingham Palace." Its occupation made
him the most sumptuously housed rep
resentative of a foreign power in thÂ«
land.- But for those who undertake ,to
live in style a town house necessitates
a, country one. In Wrest Park, leased
from Lord "Lucas, Mr. Reid has secured
a country residence that matches well
with the more artificial magnificence of
Dorchester House. It Is admittedly by
far the most .beautiful of Bedfordshire's
country homes, .though Woburn and
The.-. Hoo are i perhaps more; widely
known. With Dorchester House and
Wrest Park at his disposal. Mr. RÂ«ld
has .the - satisfaction of knowing that
no other diplomatist hers '-has such
"ample facilities for - . maintaining . his
countryrs , reputation \ for. dignity,.mun
lrtcence and hospitality. .
* ' No r muitl-mtlllohaire could create a
place \HkÂ« iWrest JPark-.^.lt^U a ; job
that '-has - taken Nature. Judiciously and

somely,.furnished and 'well ' supplied
.wfth* those important accessories which
arV-'dubbed modern conveniences. " But
money might duplicate It anywhere
without- much trouble. It is Jits 'Old-
World setting, which- no ' -'amount , -of
"money "could reproduceâ -for Time . will
not be hurried iv such mattersâ that
constitutes its mondrous charm. An
English writer, who is. well acquainted
with all of the "stately" homes of .Ens
land,", has, well said of It. "If it were
desired. to let a stranger of more than
average ,taste learn for himself what
the great_country \u25a0 houses and - their
parks and 'gardens mean to the country
districts of. England, we should be.ln
clined to think that as a whole. Wrest
Park would- teach him rather moro
than any other.", .
\u25a0 Situated within forty miles of town,
the. contrast* which it presents Jto the
surrounding region greatly enhances
Its attractions. , The land round about
is quiet, and - comparatively featureless
â just plainly rural, with. few woods or
streams, or even pretty cottages. .Then
withoutv encountering any preparatory
hint of the impending change, one sud
denly, emerges upon a far -reaching
scene of entrancing beauty â stately
parks.- lawns of , the -tenderest,. green,
sueh \u25a0. as are found only in England:
magnificent woods, groves' and walks;
avenues ; lined ;by .grand ; old trees, ex
quisite.; gardens, pool*., canals, statues,
monuments,, terraces, bridges and-pavi
lions.; It is a veritable earthly paradise
In. which Art. has -been, made to blend
with Nature with such rare > taste that
they seem to' have" sprung from the soil
together. ; ; . The domain \u25a0 Is an^ extensive
one, . but â¢ every portion of i lt seems- en
dowed with a beauty of its own. The
walks alone are seven miles in length.
There are two parkaâ one for deer &a 4
another, grazed by cattle. - -
:The'place appears never to have suf-
Jered .from neglect. Generations of
owners , have -devoted -the most Jealous
care, to 1 ; It,; and. the combined results of
their " labors â¢" It require ; a book
to' describe adequately.

The activity that Is being displayed in
the several local councils of the National

Native Daughters.
The members or La Vespero Parlor were
an attractlx'e feature of the parade in
Sacramento on Admission day. There
â¢were thirty members in line, attired in
prettily made light Wue lawn dresses and
carrying white . parasols. They were pre
ceded by Past' President Miss Annie Las
tein on horseback carrying the flag of the
parlor, said to be the most beautiful In
the order. The white satin banner of the
parlor was carried in line by a pretty
little maid. Marcella Connolly. All the
members were decorated with magnificent
badges. The parlor maintained' the repu
tation It has had for. many years of being
" the swellest parlor in the parade."
There are not' many Native Daughters
of this city who have so much endeared
themselves to the; membership, of their
particular parlors as has Miss Lastein.
During her term of office she proved her
#clf an excellent officer, and now that she
ha 6, as it .were, gone on the retired list,
cfae works just as hard for the success of
ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOM
the parlor as she did in the days when
she wielded the gavel. Miss Lastein is
now filling the responsible position of
treasurer of the parlor.
Grand President Ariana W. Stirling an
nounces the following official visits for
the remainder of the current month: To
Berendos Parlor, Red Bluff, on the 19th;
20th, Camellia Parlor, at Anderson; 21st,
Hiawatha Parlor, at Redding; 22d, Las

Eschscholfcsia Parlor, at Etna Mills, and
30th, La Estrella Parlor, in San Fran
cisco.
During the parade in Sacramento, on
Admission day the Native Daughters
made .q. .very fine showing, ,but there Is a
great deal of dissatisfaction over the fact
that while the executive board of the Na
tive Sons was given due prominence on
the programme, the executive" board of
the Native Daughters was cut out. Many
of the leading parlors throughout the
State have already announced that they
never will again help make the day or an
Admission day parade a success so long
as the head of the order- JÂ»- not recognized
as it should be. \
During the celebration days In Sacra
mento Grand President Mrs. Stirling was
the' guest of Mr. and Mrs. Job Wood.
Grand Secretary Miss Frakes.Past Grand
President Miss Keith and Past Grand
President Mrs. Caminetti were the guests
of Laura Fox, past president of La Ban
dera Parlor. .. . . .
Much praise was given to Keith, Sans
Soud'and La Esjrella parlors for the
magnificent showing each made in the
parade, and there was considerable dis
cussion as to which was the most mag
nificent. It may be asserted also that on
no parade did the Native Daughters make
a better showing as to numbers, costumes
and general appearance than did all the
parlors as a whole on the 9th of Septem
ber.
The following "is the programme of
Ruby Parlor No. 46 on Pioneer day: Song,
"My Native Land," by the members of
the parlor; address, Laura Manuel; duet,

HERE COMES
THE BRIDE
"Here comes the bride!"
From this eun-browned week till" the
dawn of Lent shall wedding bells jingle
In the ; air, and orange blossoms and
Batln and salt tears will be with us till
the break of Ash Wednesday.
And Joyous is the tradesman, and
blithe Is the gownmaker and merry the
milliner at wedding time. It's the time
for making hay, for the bride never
cays nay at the price. And therefore
is there joy in the land.
As to papa, who foots the bills, it Is
probable that he has opinions as to the
Idiocy of feminine necessities; but it's a
paying proposition on the whole, since '
some other fellow will be paying the'
bills after the wedding â that Is, he i
hopes so. I
Few winters have dawned with such <
a. crop of fascinating brides as are now I
on the threshold of matrimony. And j
not only are they pretty and charming,
but they are mostly intelligent and I
clever, which augurs well for their
cumulative happiness.
There Is Pearl Sabin, who is to marry
Captain A. W. Bjornstad. one of the
cleverest Klrls I know, possessing tact,
that priceless gift of womanhoodâ
an inherited gift that social education
has developed.
Besides, there's pretty Ethel McCor
miok, who is to wed Napier Means
Crossett; Miss Beatrice Spllralo, the
nancee of Lieutenant William Rawles
Shoemaker, a gallant sallorman; Miss
Carol Moore, who weds Arthur Duncan
Geissler on Tuesday next; Genevieve
Peters, who becomes Mrs. Arthur Dun
can, and charming Miss Alice May. who
â¢will be wed to William Aloysius Sexton
on the 21st. ii;
And thus does * the winter of '05 be
gin with a bevy of beautiful brides â a
health to them!

Charity calls' again! this time in be
half of waif babies. Now, who could
resist the appeal of unwelcome, un
loved, lonely little babes' who find
themselves stranded In this Queer old
world, full of noise and cold winds, and
not half enough milk to keep their little
tummies full.
On Thursday evening, ' the 21st, at
Steinway Hall, a concert will be given
for the relief of the Foundling Asylum
babes, Hotber Wlsmer to direct It..
And Denis O'Sulllvan has promised
to assist, as .have Mrs. M. E. Blanchard,

quintuple millionaire. And how the
clever mammas have been baiting their
hooks! But 'tis all in vainâ at least
at present, since the young man
seems to be more occupied with his
work and play at college than with
dalliances in the court of love. .
However, cheer up, mammas, cheer
up!
The young man Is taking up his offi
cial residence at San Mateo, so he Is
not to be lost sight of, even If he does
put in the next two years at Yale.
He will be with us again; don't
worry.
It Is said that the unwed and im
pecunious peers of England raised an
awful fuss when they discovered ; that
a flve million-dollar American heiress
had been among them and got away
unattached. And such was the case.
And the heiress was Miss Jennie
Crocker, sister of young Templeton,
who had been a euest of the Whitelaw
Reids at Dorchester House.
While in London the modest, de

SUNDAY . . . . . . . SEPTEMBER i>,\- 1905
AFTER all the hard experiences of war, followed by rioting in
Japanese cities, and by disturbance and. bloodshed in Russia
from Finland to the Caucasus, there is one pleasant picture in
the return of the Chinese in Manchuria to their war-wasted homes.
Their country has been for nearly two years turned into a battle
ground on which two armies of aliens strove for the mastery. Their
villages have been burned, their fields- laid waste, the landscape
seamed and blackened, and soaked with the blood of strangers.
They tied with what they could carry from all that they called
home and hid in the mountains and forests, living as they could,
and wailing. Xo matter what may be thought of the peace in Japan
and Russia, these humble folk arc happy, and if they know tha,t
the war was ended by the act of President Roosevelt his name will
cause an effusion of gratitude that is seldom accorded to any but the
gods they worship.
Manchuria is a fine and fertile country. It is not exposed to
the disastrous floods that sw-eep the vast valley of the Yellow River.
Its climate is temperate. It has the four seasons and in the people
is the vigor of the temperate zone races. The Manchu'rians proper
proved their quality by a political conquest of China and the in
stallation at Peking of the Ming dynasty. The labor of the province
and its potential population are from China. It was the prize that
incited the commercial and territorial ambition of Russia, and it has
been traversed first by the Czar's army that went to Peking in the
Boxer war and again by the devastating armies of Japan and Russia.
After such an experience the heart of the world is made glad
by the picture of long trains of carts and people returning to their
- own from their mountain cover, smiles on all faces and happiness in
every heart. As they march they cry out in joy ''Peace, Peace!"
The scene is more thrilling than an action at arms. They go
patiently and with courage to rebuild their homes, stake out and
till their fields, and resume the life of contentment which they
led before war fell' upon them like a storm from the sky, without
their act or agency or wish.
Asia has suffered from the real or supposed' richness of her
resources, and war has for ages swept over that vast continent,
surprising the plain and humble people at their toil. Manchuria
was the latest temptation, and -let t:s hope will be the last sufferer.
It was the analogue of the Indian Carnatic, whose green mountains
and well watered plains were not permitted to support in peace the
natural owners of the soil. Where should have been pastoral peace
and plenty hateful war raged and ravaged until the main river of
the land flowed red into the sea at Muntafilly. Forts and strong
holds crowned the hills at Madura, Tranquebar. Negapatam and
the other cities that never should have seen greater disturbance
than market day. The Polygars led their troopers like an evil spirit
over the growing fields, and left the- plowmen dead behind them.
There Hyder AH left the land behind his cloud of savage Moham
medan warriors, bare and smoking as a furnace floor. Then fell
upon the land the Pax Britannica. The peasants returned to their
fields and the towns to their tranquillity. Now over the Carnatic all
that stands to tell the story of the past war and woe are the dis
mantled fortresses, and where the Polygars prepared their death
dealing sorties the vine hangs its perfumed bloom and birds sing
to their young. â¢
So may it be in Manchuria and wherever war has left its abhor-
â -- â . -- â â â - â â â
rent track. The happy song of the Chinese peasants, going home
again, crying "Peace," is sweeter to the hearing and heart of human
ity than all the deeds of heroism that gem the war that is ended.
May the people of Japan recover from their war frenzy and be
made to understand that this is a new world, and not theÂ» world of
Ghengis, Tamerlane and Hyder AH. May they also learn that the
statesmen of Japan by their poise and balance have touched, this
new World with its most alluring light.
The abstention and self-control written large upon the peace
treaty by Japan is the most significant event since Christianity
emerged from the cave^-and catacombs and became the religion of
* the Western world. Let the people of that empire go forward to
the place where their leaders and statesmen stand, and they will not
dim the glory that shines upon their country in the smiles of the
home-going peasants of Manchuria. â¢
A PEACEFUL INVASION.
CANADA'S western provinces are receiving a remarkable sim
ulus because of the incoming of multitudes of settlers from
the United States. This movement is spoken of in Canada
as "the Yankee invasion." It is not only a peaceful, but a heartily,
even urgently, invited invasion, and will bring added prosperity to
the country entered and at the same time make, in a way, a conquest
for the United States. By sending over the border this industrial
army we will win a good will and a fostering and developing of
mutually profiting trade relations. Probably nothing we could do"
would be more likely to insure the permanency of friendly relations
with our northern neighbor than this intermixture of our people
with the Canadians in the work of developing their great Northwest.
An article in Public Opinion," a report by Jackson Tinker of a
trip through Canada from Montreal to the Pacific Coast, says that
James J. Hill, president of the Great Northern Railroad, thinks.there
is no reason why Canada should not have, 50,000,000 population in
fifty years hence. Ji:mes W. Taylor, for many years United States
Consul at Winnipeg, is convinced that Canada will become the
great wheat-producing country of the world, and that three-fourths
of the spring wheat area of this continent will be north of the
boundary line.
Yankee settlers have increased the wheat-growing area of the
Northwest Provinces by millions of acres. They have taught the
Canucks some very valuable methods of handling prairie soil, and
in the building of grain elevators and the organization of traffic and
transportation their energy and enterprise have been appreciated
factors. The Dominion Government has appropriated $1,000,000 to
procure immigrants of a desirable class to" take up land in Western
Canada, and of this $300,000 will be spent in inducing farmers from
our- Northwest to come and make^ their hpmes in the Dominion.
Upward of. $100,000,000 of American capital is said to be invested
in Canadian enterprises. This year 50,000 immigrants are moving^
up there, and in the past six years the number of such settlers has"
reached the large aggregate of 200,000.
There is an amusing incident' told of the thrift of a pair of these
settlers. Two Americans, man and wife, were divorced in "the
States" in order that they might go into Canada and take up- two
homesteads of 160 acres each under the Canadian law. They got
what they went for and are holding down the claims. They live in
separate shacks: but apparently arc exceedingly neighborly and. visit
back and forth oh the best of terms. *
REGENERATION OF AFRICA!

pÂ» ORMAL opening of the bridge over the Zambesi River near
ri Victoria Falls, which has just been reported, is a' reminder of
1 the wonderful changes that are taking place' in- the Dark Conti-

tum from the Khalifa and so made the supremacy Vof England '"as
sured all over' the Soudan. The completion of this great bridge, the
highest jn?the world, marks a period in the progress of the "Cape

will soon be made a reality.

"A fellow of infinite Jest" is Alfred
Tresidder Sheppard, author of the new
novel, "The Red Cravat." but some
times he can be almost serious. The
story Uof the year 1730; and the eccen
tric Prussian King. Frederick William,
he of the famous fondness for exceed
ingly tall grenadiers, is the personage
whose portrayal giy^es a semi-historic
tinge to the tale and whose cranky
tyranny is the cardinal thing on which
l*anÂ« all the sad, the glad and the
humorous happenings that make the
story go.
It does go, with a swing, as you will
find almost as soon as you get started
en it. â¢ The writer is fluent, abundant of
pith: 1 -taiion, ac/I must be of exten
sive ..;g and retentive memory, in
an ii.w. .ouctory rhyme to the reader he
liki :> his composition to a play and tne
characters to puppets taken out of a
dusty box, the Past. ~Â«e begs forgiveness
1U the wires are rusty now, and if the
Victors move "stiffly in antick strife or '
love." He need not apologize for his pup- 1
pets; they play their parts very well,
especially the old Countess yon Schunk,
whose wickedness Is piquant and whose
wits are more than a match for the
King's. Â« .
If you are impatiently, curious about
knowing the meaning of the title you
must jump to the book's middle and learn
that "The .Red Cravat" was, with the red
coat, the uniform of the King's gren
adiers. The imperious monarch made the
kidnaped recruit. Catherwood," the hero
of the story, wear the red cravat, will
he nlll he. because he was tall Â£o the
extent of six feet four, and the King
â¢was capturing all he could of such for
soldiers. For that same tall reason he
ordered cur hero to marry a very tall
woman, with the intent of helping to
keep up the stock of big grenadiers
hereditarily in the kingdom of Prussia.
Now Catherwood was in love with a lit
tle, slender slip of - a girl named Joan,
and it struck him as a very grim joke
to be under military orders to marry a
big, tall woman and go occupy a cottage
provided for his honeymoon convenience.
The story gets exciting when you come
close to that crisis. However, that doesn't
become imminent until far along in the
narrative, and to get nearer the beginning
we must consider the love affairs of ;
Baron yon Gundling, the King's cham
berlain and court jester, the fun of which
is unmitigated by any sympathy for the
'old worldling of a courtier who was oyer-
L to the extent of trying to play
p^j. the heart strings of three women all
*t once.
The fun begins "with the exclamatory
sentence. "A plague on the traitorous
noses of little girls!" The said little noses
had all gone off. at once in "loud
a-tishoos" because the old chamberlain
had scattered snuff as he took It to hide
his agitation, and the sneezes, which
occurred in church, attracted attention
to the awful embarrassment of the old<
man. He was worried because his love
letter, clandestinely placed in a hymn
book, fell into the hands of a lady for
whom it was not intended, to wit: the
Princess Frederika Louisa, second
daughter of the terrifically tempered
King. The Princess read the note and
turning looked with eyebrows raised at
Grundling as he trembled in despair.
TLen the little girls' noses went off,
"a-taosh! a-toos!" where they sat in
the oil*, courtier's pÂ«w, and -everybody
looked. "A plague on the traitorous
noses of little girls"*
The letter which the Princess read was
& proposal of marriage to the Baroness
yon Gossling. Gundling, whose first mar
riage haul not been a very happy one, had
for long years made his rule of life that
maxim of Sir Thomas Browne's which
says: '"Know no woman In particular,
but commend them all in general to God."
However, there were two who dodged
each other in his dreams at night; and
after much cogitation and long halting
between Gretchen Lleberlich and the
widowed Baroness he fixed his choice
vpon the latter. Hence the letter in the
, hymn book and the Princess' discovery of
I tie infatuation.
*Â» Another of the characters for whose
funny misfortunes we are not made to
feel axy sympathy deterrent of laughter
is Fassman, an understudy of Grundling,
and who has ambitious hopes of stepping
into the latter's shoes as soon as he can
scheme out some plan to get rid of him.
The King's anger at Grundling's love
letter gives Fassman a suggestion of a
plot to eend the old man packing to ban
ishment while Fassman would take his
offices and emoluments.. He gets some
armed guards to aid him, and hustling
old Grundling out of bed late that night
informs him that the Infuriated King had
ordered him immediately hanged for
writing love letters to the Baroness.
Gundling pleads for Just a little time in
which to writ* some letters. He com
poses thre*â all lovÂ« letters, and all to
different women. They are sad, heart
rending farewells, and to each lady he
Intimates that if his life had beÂ«n spared
he would have wooed her ardently. To
the widow he scribbled: "Utterae non
erubescent, as Cicero says, a letter does
not blush. I. a dying man, with a few
minutes only before meâ the sands of
my life fa*t running outâ tell you what I
have hitherto tried, but failed to do. I
have no time nor space to chow the depth
of my affection. In happier circumstances
it would have been my dearest hope to
have won you for my bride. Alasâ the
might have beens!"
To the young girl, Gretchen, he wrote
that he' was at the point of cleats, and
that she was the flower he wished to
rollick; "but the reaper's Bcjrthe, alas. Is
busy at Wusterhausen. Amor et melle et
fella est fecundlsaimusâ love, as Plautus
cays, Is fruitful In honey and gall; sweet
ness and bitterness mingle in my thoughts
of you."
His third letter was to a married lady,
end the prospect of immediate death gave
him his golden opportunity to make love
to her: "Dearest Frau Muller." he wrote},
"Moriturus te salutoâ a. dying: man salutes
you: and at this moment my lips which
hare been sealed for so lons, and will
soon be sealed forever, can say what they
have never dared to sayâ can tell you of
the affection which your marriage (though
to an uncongenial man; a man, to say
nothing unkind of him, too gross for your
fine nature) has kept me from disclosing.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Love Is incompatible with fear,
says Publius Eyrius; and the knowledge
of your love, chaste yet tender, sustains
in this moment your unhappy Grundling."
These notes were duly delivered to the
ladies, but, after all. Grundling was not
hanged. It would have been almost better
for him If he had been hanged than to
have to face the consequences of those
three letters.
One of the most humorous scenes In the
book Is between the brilliant old virago,
Countess yon Schunk, - and the tantrum
subject king of the Prussians. The
Countess owed allegiance to George of
Hanover and England. She was in Ber
lin. She saw the King, finely arrayed in
his "blue and red uniform, his nankeen
breeches, and spatter-dashes all fresh
pipe-clayed."

Is the seriously good part. Even that Is
mixed with jest. A combination scene of
prettiness, pathos and humor lies where
the irate Countess first gets a hint that
Catherwood loves her niece. The hotel
chambermaid comes down to where this
trio are breakfasting, and, winking at
the â¢waiter, she hands Catherwood a
handkerchief, telling him he had left It
under his pillow. It's a dainty little
lace affair, and the suspicious Countess
demands to examine it. Joan blushes
deeply and the old lady recognizes it
as one she had given her niece. , Then
she cross-examines Catherwood as to
why he wanted to keep the long ago
captured trophy under his pillow, and
the young lover had to own up.

Crisis Period
Russia has for long been a very Inter
esting study, but probably never more so
in the history of civilization than at the
present time. By those who have looked
deeply into its history and its recent con
dition this is regarded as a crisis time for
the Slavs, therefore the contribution to
the study from the University of Chicago
Press called "Russia and Its Crisis," by
Paul Mllyoukov, is timely, and it Indi
cates by Its title just the point of view
from which we wish to see that big and
backward country cleared.
Paul llilyoukov is a Russian who speaks
and writes In English. He was a lec
turer on "Russian Civilization" at the
University, of Chicago in 1903, and as
late as December, , 1304; was lecturing at
the Lowell Institute in Boston on the
subject of '"The Russian Crisis." The
present book is essentially the same as
those lectures, but the author has con
sidered events up to - January, 1905. and
has not altered his conclusions as ex
pressed In his lectures. The opinions of
this scholar are in strong opposition to
the Russian Government and to the prin
ciples of autocracy.
To swiftly get to a brief statement of
: what he sees the "crisis" to be we may
pick this passage: "No form of govern
ment can survive, we may say with
Speransky, which possesses no moral
force and Is obliged to carry all Its orders
! into execution by mere material force.
\u25a0 And if the only question that remains
Is: How long will the material force of
the bayonets side with the government?
then the position Is desperate."
, This student of the history and the con
ditions of Russia finds that there is noth
ing opposed to autocracy's overthrow ex
cept the mere fact of its being there in
ftll possession of power! There is /no
similar, foundation In the Czar's power 'to
that strength of the British monarchy
which : is said to be broad based upon
tho people's wIIL There; are two things
which may* bring about a general out
breakâpolitical disaffection and material
wanU/Both of these are reaching a very i
\u25a0acute stage. ' j
.The first is.not so easily estimated as
to Its growth and present strength as is
the other, for secrecy is both the policy
and the necessity, of those citizens who
emphatically; differ,- with the vGovern
ment. ? The , peasant population of I Rus
sia constitutes SO per cent of the whole,
and these are mostly very Ignorant, dif
ficult to induce . to . organized effort, and
have non:resistance '': Ingrained into
them by centuries of- the habit of sub
mission to absolute; authority. What
the educated classes who are not them
selves direct partakers in . the , tyranny
think of; autocratic government \ may Â« oe
estimated '\u25a0 from | the , fact that] last Jan
uary about 400'professors^fromall the
Russian universities' and, other .higher
Institutions of learning signed a decla
ration stating that no educational ac
tivity, no study of science's possibe so
long as the people are ' not 'granted , po
litical: representation.
THE SAN FRANGISCOUCALL, :l SUNDAY,, SEPTEMBER- 17, 1905:
As for the second factor that goes to
make the urgency -.* of reformâ the
gTowth of material wantâ that . Is a
power that can be positively measured
by statistics, and the rapid year by
year intensification of it calls out that
a crisis of some kind must be close at
hand, either a reform willingly granted
by the-'Government, or a big, blind, in
stinctfv e ( revolt against a condition of
things so intolerable that even the fa
mous stolid Russian patience could not
bear it For a nation, the great major
ity of whose subjects are as poor as
are the masses of the, Russians to make
war unless honor or self-defense posi
tively compelled it seems little short of
a. crime. Some figures showing the de
cay of prosperity, are: Since 1860 the
allotments of land holdings In the com
mune has shrunk from 100 to 54.2 per
cent; this has not been: made up for. by
intensive cultivation, for the crops have
diminished, and so have the number of
cattle on a unit of arable land; arrears
of taxes have increased from 22 to 117
per I cent, and the emigration has in
creased 546 per cent. Those figures are
for the whole of Russia; but In the cenr
tral provinces much more ominous sta
tistics are evidences of dire distress.
Sometimes the distress will be so
great In a community that many of the
men will wander off to find work and
the lucky ones among these will return
with. from $28 to $46 as the resulc of
their year's toil. Some fall to find work

tic orders that "sayj^inust,'i-',when" his 'con
scious \ reason â¢ knew} not iwhy-^-the . haunt-
ing urge being hidden cause of bis genius
for success. V ." -
' Once ; started on his 'biographical task,
Carnegie enjoyed the . study ' of the great
steam - master i thoroughly, and expresses
the hope; as of utmost he could ask,' that
the ; reader will enjoy \u25a0\u25a0'- the perusing as
thoroughly as he did the writing. He tells
of Watt's * youth ; ' and It is -: fine encour
agement -â¢ to those who might be apt to
consider themselves starting out on life
handicapped to "hear the proverb, ap
proved, "The best heritage to which a
man can be born is poverty." , He got the
best of the thoughts that stimulated the
young Watt woven Into the narration.
When . the . young t man was for the first
time alone In London, witnout a relative,
a friend, or ; even one acquaintance, and
forced to make his way, he Just has to
let the lines swing mill tantly In his
memory from Walter Scott:
- For . this Is Collantogle ford.
And . Thou must keep thee with thy sword,
and apply them figuratively to his pres
ent plight. Watt had "been fed on
Wallace and Bruce." "Did Wallace ever
give up the fight or ever think of giv
ing up?" and then again he Is ever, as
a Scot, to remember Bruce and the spi
der. -'DldrÃruce-falter? Never. Nei
ther would he." Then Carnegie tells
1 how many ; a Scottish boy : has - been
steeled i to go through life's worst crises
with the stir of that battle cry ringing
within him ever since It was planted
there while In his teens, "Scots wha
hae." , â¢-'.'"\u25a0
So much for a suggestion of his
youth; and now for a gllmps*e of him
when far along in the stern struggle of
middle, life. "This tells the whole story,
and once again reminds us that without
imagination and something: of the ro
mantic element little great or valuable
is to be done in^ny field. He _,"runs his
business as If i^Tirere a romance," was
said upon one occasion. .^The man who
finds no element of romance in his oc
cupation is. to be pitied." He recognized
in.Watt not only the original inventive
genius, but the â¢ indefatigable, earnest,
plodding. and thorough mechanic of te
nacious grip; and withal, a fine, modest,
true man, who cared nothing for wealth
beyond'a very modest provision for old
age."
': Passing -from Watt the genius to
consider Watt the man. we get this:
"We ; hasten *to record that In the'do
main of . the personal graces and vir
tues, we have evidence of his excellence
as copious and assured as for. his pre
eminence in invention and discovery."
And nnally. "So passes Jamie Watt, the
man. from view â a man w.ho attracted,
delighted, ijipressed. Instructed and
made lifelong friends of his fellows to
a. degree unsurpassed, perhaps un
cqualed."

Literary J\fotes
and Excerpts
A statue of. Tennyson by G. F. Watts
was recently unveiled on the Minster
Green in the city, of Lincoln. The London
Athenaeum complains that the event at
tracted ' less j attention J than - would have
been expected from the combination of the
two names. Members of the Tennyson
family were ; on the platform. -r One of
them. Mr. Tennyson d'Eyncouft, briefly
seconded a motion of thanks to the widow
of- the sculptor. Lord ! Hallam Tennyson
was present, but did not speak. The chief
orators* were the Bishop and 'Dean-i of
Lincoln. The latter in Tennysonlan phrase
described " the " statue as ~ "molded of Ar
thur, made by Merlin." Its Inspiration Is
found in the lines of Tennyson quoted by
the Bishop:- '
Flower In th* crannied wall,
I pluck you ' out Of the crannies.
I i hold you here, root and all. In my hind.
Little flower; but if I could understood
What you are, root' and all. and all in all.
I should , know what God and man is.
: It shows the poet with bent head pon
dering on the flower. he holds. A dog by
his side looks trustingly and. lovingly up
to his face, seeking, as Watts himself ex
plained, for that "guidajice to the secret
of the larger, life." which the poet sought
to wrest from the flower.â New York Her

To the more discriminating reader the
very multiplicity of magazines even of the
other sort Is & serious Inconvenience.. It
Is Impossible to keep up with them,. and
the best . things are so scattered that
many of them are Inevitably missed. It
would be a real boon, If there were any
way of bringing it about, to establish an'
American eclectic, not a patch- work of
snippets such as & number of useful
periodicals give us, but a selection each
month of the best stories, poems and art
icles that appeared In the magazines of
the month before. The obstacle would,
of course, be the question of copyright,
but If everybody were - reasonable even
this could be surmounted. For if such a
review had a large circulation It . could
afford to pay handsomely for the privi
lege of reprinting, and if It did not suc
ceed so well It would by so much less In
terfere with the sale of the article in the
original package. The disheartening;
thing In reading magazines Is their dif
fusion and their impermanence; the good
things are so scattered that It is hard to
keep track* of them. Readers who like
to keep a little hold on things, to pick
up and carry with them a few grains of
gold as they pass through the desert,
.would welcome a magazine which even a
little tardily should gather together the
best things that are being done. Such a
periodical would be an honor class; out of
the great mass of the fairly good it
would pay attention only to what had
conspicuous merit. It would be, In short,
such a magazine as we might have If
there weren't so' fatally many.âSprtng

In Harper's for. September Mr. Alden
makes some Interesting statements on the
relations of author and editor:
"When all has been said. It comes to
this, as far as magazines are concerned,
that the best of them must insist upon
the thing rather than the name, to such
an extent. Indeed, that they more eagerly
welcome the thing without the name.
Hence the Inconsistency of the claim
sometimes made by an author, and made
with every appearance of modesty, that
his reputation, fairly won, entitles him
to the unquestioned acceptance of a con
tribution which an editor has m general
terms solicited. As a writer of marked
distinction puts It: .'I, years ago, ceased
to submit stories "on approval." Another,
writer, of equal distinction and greater
popularity, claims that only on the ground '
of moral impropriety can an ordered story
be declined. Still another makes it a.
condition that his stories shall be paid
for. at the price agreed upon, on the de
livery of the copyâ that Is, before the
editor has the privilege of even reading It.
The assumption 13 that, in such a ca3e.
the author must be the sole Judge of tho
acceptability of his story. The position,
frankly and honestly enough taken, mani
festly puts the editor, at an unfair dis
advantage, and would probably never be
assumed but for the sanction given it by
the custom of periodicals which are con
fessedly satisfied to secure the distinction
of the author's name Irrespectively of tha
Intrinsic value of his contribution."

Household charm is the most precious
of all household qualities. It Is.inde
finable, elusive, delicate quality that per
haps every householder seeks to have,
and which every one ought to wish, to
give to his house. It is a quality not
measured by cost. for,*as a matter of
fact," It Is quite Independent of cost.
Many costly houses, on which ; great
sums of money have been expended.* are
intlrely without " charm, while many In
expensive dwellings ' are thoroughly
charming In every way.
Do not. : however, make the mistake
of Imagining that charm only obtains In '
low cost houses and low cost rooms.
The comparatively "-^expensive room on *
which thought and care." love and in
terest, have been lavished Is more apt
to be attractive than a high priced room
simply because V all these things have
gone Into Its furnishings and arrange- \u25a0.
ment. Richly, furnished rooms can be
as thoroughly " charming as : those fur
nished at less cost, but their charm will
be of a different. nature, since It r will be
produced by different materials and In a
different way. \u0084. V. ."
The .charming room Is the personal
room, the " room that gives evidence of .
personal : car* , and thought, in which
every object . seems to . nave personal
merit, "in which the" color scheme, the
walls,, the ; curtains, the carpet, or rugs '\u25a0â¢
give evidence, as -they are thoroughly
capable of giving, of personal selection
and value. It Is thought that produces
results in room arrangement, exactly as
it brings results In other things; and un
less a room gives evidence of thoughtful
care, of Intelligent study, of manifest In
tent to produce a ' harmonious Interior.
It can have no charm, and. at the most,
will have only Interest of a comparative
ly slight 'â¢\u0084 amount.â From . 'American

Rhein Real Estate Ccmipany, .and 'the
Frank estate, the sellers, : by ; A". , J. j Rich

most important deals pf the year. The
property commences at the Intersection of '

JEALOUS RAGE DRIVES WIFE
TO COMMIT BLOODY DEED.
Cuts Throat Af
ter Wounding
Husband.
Ghastly Trag
edy Enacted in
Oakland.
OAKLAND, Sept 16.â Insanely Jeal
ous and fired with the determination to
end her misery and the life of the man
She held responsible for it, airs. Anna
C Dauth first shot her husband in the
bead with a revolver about 6 o'clock
this morning: as he lay sleeping: beside
her, and then, when the wounded man
had blindly wrenched the weapon from
her, attacked him with a razor and
gashed his neck and wrist. She then
used the blade upon herself, cutting: her
own throat and ending: her life.
It was in the gray dawn of the morn
ing: that Arthur K. Dauth. salesman for
C. W. Kinsey. furniture dealer at 527
Twelfth street, was awakened by the
Etingr of a bullet from a revolver. Blood
gushed from . a wound in his temple
made by the bullet. The missile, after
striking: him, had glanced and em
\ bedded Itself in his pillow. The shock
\u25a0 : not stun him. but the blood blinded
**his eyes as he grappled with his in
furiated wife. He wrenched the weapon
away from her as she tried to shoot
him a second time. He broke the re
volver in trying to take the cartridges
from it and thew the weapon out of
the window-
It was at this juncture that Â« Mrs.
Dauth made her second attempt to kill
him. Coming swiftly up behind .him,
she drew the keen blade of the razor
across his throat, making a gaping
wound. He turned upon her, and, in
trying to grasp the razor, his wrist
was badly cut. Seemingly satisfied
that he could not survive, the woman
drew the razor across her own throat
aiid died while being taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital. -^;;;
*, .inoisEDÃv cnv of murder.
"5" Th 6â apartments of the pair were Â«t
the Colonial, a boarding-house at 914
Castro street, near Eighth. Here they
had three rooms. The report of- the
pistol roused the sleeping inmates ot
the house, as did the cry of "Murder!"
from the affrighted man when attacked
by his wife with the razor. Park Pal
freenian, a tea dealer and son-in-law
of Cecil Drake and his wife, who con
duct the place, ran to the door of the
Dauth apartments and found it locked.
Dauth, in answer to Palfreeman's
knocking, said he could not find the '
key, as it had been hidden. He begged j
"P^lfreeman to summon a doctor and |
the police and have the door broken in.
In the meantime his wife was breath- !
ing her last, writhing in her own blood
|Â£a the floor at his feet. â¢
Drake went to a nearby stable and
called up the police. The patrol wagon
was immediately sent to the house and
husband and wife were placed inside
and driven rapidly to the Receiving
Hospital, where they arrived at 5:50
o'clock, nearly an hour after the shot
was fired. A look at the woman told
Drs. R. T. Stratum and L. L. Riggin
and Steward Harry Borchert that her
case was hopeless. She had died on
the way to the hospital. When she was
lifted up the head fell back, showing
the vertebrae, and the surgeons turned
to the husband, who, fearfully cut and
covered with blood, still was able to
talk and realize what was. going on
about him.
KISSES DEAD WOMAN.
The surgeons turned their main at
tention to the wound in Dauth'* neck.
A quick examination of the wounded
forehead had told them that the bul
let had not penetrated the skull. While
the razor had made a long gash, the
big veins, seated deep in the sides of
the neck, had escaped. This wound was
eewed up and the flow of blood from
his wrist was stopped. Then the pistol
wound was probed, and It was found
that a groove furrowed the bone, but
there was no fracture. When all had
been attended to Dauth was able to
leave the hospital, and, for some rea
son, only known to Chief of Police
Hodgklns, he was kept in the City
Prison all day.
s' An affecting scene occurred at the
iospital when. In answer to the notice
cent to the Morgue, the wagon arrived
at the former place to take away the
body of the unfortunate woman. Dauth
heard that the body was to be removed
and begged to be allowed to see It once
more. Though his wounds were only
partly dressed he stooped over the mo
tionless form and kissed the ghastly
face, still warm, and tears filled his
eyes and his emotions choked his
speech.
Dauth was taken to the City Prison
and there made the following state
ment: "My wife had accused me of go
ing about with other women and said
â¢he would kill herself, but that when
Bhe did she would take me with her. I
flid not take much stock In what she
Bald, â¢but about a week ago I hid my
revolver after taking the cartridges out
and putting them in a bureau drawer,
[t was of 38 caliber. "She evidently
found It and the cartridges.
MRS. DAUTH COMPLAINS.
"The razor was .also mine, being part
5f a shaving set she gave me last
Christmas. She evidently took it for :
:he purpose she made of It, and. I am
;onvinced she laid all her plans very i
carefully. The door was locked on the
nsJde and the key hidden on the man
el-piece/, where I found it afterward,
she also coaxed me to" go to bed after'
ye had had a quarrel last night about j
I o'clock. She had, however, no cause
o be jealous of. me. and I. believe she
:ould not have been exactly right in
ier mSnd." >_ " \u25a0
Miss May Barthold, a friend of the
Scad woman, tells a. somewhat differ
Â£it story of Dauth's action. She said:
.Annie was; worrying [terribly over the
ray her husband .was acting.. He left
ler for four days last week and went
o San Francisco. Monday, morning she

that they had had a quarrel. Saturday
night near the Bell Theater and he had
pinched her hand until It was black
and blue to make her stop talking. She
showed me her /hand at the time. She
said- she had refused to go home with
him after that and she told me to tell
him. If he asked me anything about it,
that . she had stayed with me at my
room at the Hawthorne at Thirteenth
and Washington streets. j> \u25a0 \u25a0 .;
"Thursday night I went around to
their house and Arthur asked me if
Annie had stayed with me Saturday arid
Sunday nights and I told him that 'she
had. Before he came home that night
Annie told me that at lunchtlme they
had had a quarrel and that he had
choked her. She seemed very down-,
hearted about her, troubles and I. told
her to brace up and not worry herself
to death over any man. and she said'
she would not give him that much sat-
Isf action." \u25a0 . , . â¢
HER SECOXD MARRIAGE.
Mrs. Drake/, the landlady at .the Co
lonial, also tells 'of the. wife. worrying:
"Last Thursday," she said, "I' took a
letter up to Mrs. Dauth for "her hus
band and asked her ; if he .'was home."
She told me that he had Just come home
and had been away four. days. 'If;- 1
could only cry.' she said. 'I would feel
better.' I asked her what was the mat
ter and she said, 'Oh, it is the' old 'story
of wine and women.' ".. . ,
C. W. Kinsey, for whom Dauth has
worked for the last year,. eays that he
has been a good salesman and "the
steadiest he ever employed/ He said
that prior to working, for, him he had
been with the McCarthy Furniture
Company of San Francisco f or .â¢\u25a0 f oiir
years and came to him with an excep
tional recommendation, which he had
made good while in his employ.^ -
Before her last marriage Mrs. Dauth
was the wife of Ike Anderson, the son
of a Pioneer expressman of this' city
He got into trouble here and was ar
rested and afterward went to San
Francisco, where he-got into 'more
trouble, and.it was then that his' wife
got a divorce from him. She had one

KARLSTAD. Sept. 18.â The first of
ficial announcement Indicating that tha
delegates of Norway and Sweden weru
approaching any understanding in their
effort to establish a modus vlvendl for
the countries as separate Governments
was given out to-night at the close of
the joint session of the delegates. Tha
announcement reads:
â¢The probabilities are that In the
\u25a0ear future .' the nc go tlatiuns . cam be
brought to a definite result."
This somewhat cryptic announcement
Is accepted as indicating that the nego
tiations have reached a stage when an
agreement is in sight and that a re
sort .to arms, : which might have In
volved other powers, may ' safely be
considered :to be out of the Question.
At this hour the delegates and other
officials decline to throw further light
on 'the subject ot the negotiations,
which will be resumed to-morrow.
J It is taken for granted that a com
promise ' has been reached on the sub
ject, of fortifications, which haa been
the- crux of the situation since ,' the
start, and that the main questions will
be arbitrated.
It is believed hero "that considerable
influence was brought to bear on both
sides looking to concessions by which
the wounding of the sensibilities of the
people of either nation might - be
avoided , and an entente between tha
Scandinavian people secured
* The report that the powers had made
representations: to Sweden was based
on the fact that Great Britain, France
and: Germany offered their services it
they became necessary.
LONDON*. Sept. 16. â During the day
the belief that. there. would be an ami
cable â¢ settlement of the Swedish and
Norwegian dispute developed into con
fidence. There is reason to believe that
King Edward had taken a direct per
sonal interest in the matter, and it U
known that messages bearing upon tha
situation . at Karlstad have been con
tinually passing between the Foreign
Office and the King for the last two
days. In fact, it is believed that Kins
Edward suggested a modus vlvendi.
The exact nature of this, of course, is
not known, but it is understood that
Dr. Nansen. the Arctic explorer, who
has been mentioned as the first Nor
wegian Minister to London, and tha
Swedish Minister here approved of the
proposal that, instead of demolition of
the frontier fortresses, they should ba
disarmed, Sweden and Norway agree-.
Ing not to Increase armaments and en
tering into a permanent peace treaty.
This is believed In London to form the
basis of the agreement.
It is understood in London that, after
a full agreement is signed. Prince
Charles of Denmark will be elected
King of Norway.
PARIS, Sept. 16. â Despite the contra
dictory statements made on the sub
ject, information reaching the highest
authorities shows that the mobiliza
tion ;of Norway's forces is now going
on. The French Government has made
conciliatory representations at Stock
holm,' with the view to averting a rup
ture. Official; sentiment here tends
toward, ar arrangement whereby Nor
way would be permitted to continue
some of her frontier - fortifications. It
Is " understood v" that * other powers '.are
Joining, ln pacific representations, as a
rupture \u25a0 Is considered likely to cause
entanglements throughout Europe.
*-. CHRISTIANIA,.Sept. 16.â The official
communication Issued at Karlstad was

and * was immediately . spread on bul
letin boards, to be :. read by crowds

MARCONI SECURITIES
Through an agreement with Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Com-
pany. Ltd., we offer a limited amount of shares Â©< the JIARCOXI WIRE-
LESS TELEGRAPH COMPANY OP CANADA. LTD., at par, $5.00, full paid
and non-assessable. On or before October 6th an
In the trice of these auares to $5.00 will be made, which will be fol-
lovveo within a short time by a further advance to 5G.00. and we expeci
the price to reach J7.00 before January Ist.
A few reasons lor recommending : strongly the purcEase Of these
shares are as follows:
â¢ Ist. Because Canada, by reason of the vastness of Its territory and
its widely separated centers of population, offers an unusually favorable
iKIJ for the establishment of an internal"*system of wireless telegra-
phy. Tiie great Canadian Northwest, including British Columbia and
the Yukon territory, is now almost wholly without telegraphic facili-
ties-, and the Marconi system can be installed for a mere fraction of
the cost ol wire systems. The need for parly extension of the Marconi
system throughout tho Dominion must thereiore be apparent.
2nd. Kecause there Is at present n* direct means of communication
by cable or otherwise between Canada and England other than by the
Marconi .system, ali messages ha\ing to pass over foreign cables. Over
\u2666 u.000.00y a year is spent by Canadian citizens for cable massages,
.mere is 1.0 reason wny this great sum ot money should go as tribute
to cable companies owned in Europe. â¢
3rd. liecause all trans-Atlantic steamers now equipped with Mar-
coni \\ ireless on their voyages between Kurope and either Canada or
tne United States must pass within 100 miles of a Canadian Marconi
wireless station. A very considerable traffic must therefore pass through
this station.
4th. Because the Marconi Company is already firmly established in
Canada, v/bere it has already fourteen stations in successful operation
and seven more under construction.
sth. because the Canadian stations thus far built have been erected
at a cost of over $500,000, including equipment, ar.d others are to be
immediately erected in Western Canada at Nelson. Cranbrook. Calgary,
Edmonton. Brandon. Winnipeg. Fort William. Rossland. Vancouver and
victoria.
tith. Because one of the greatest trans-Atlantic Marconi stations has
been erected at Glace Bay. Cape Breton, at a cost, including the real
estate, of. $150,000. This station is in constant communication with
steam, rs at sea and is only awaiting , the eauinment. of the Poldhu sta-
tion,' in England, with new and more powerful apparatus to inaugurate
Its trans-Atlantic wireless service.
The transmission of messages clear across the ocean has been thor-
oughly tr.stf>d for over two months. As a result of these successful tests
the announcement will be made within the next few weeks of the open-
ing of these stations to the public for regular commercial business.
The n<t annual revenues of this station alone, working jointly with the
Polclhu station, are conservatively estimated at $1, 120,000, or nearly 25
per cent of the total capitalization. .
7th. Because both the Dominion and the Newfoundland governments
have officially adopted the Marconi system and give it their unqualified
support and indorsement and granted it substantial subsidies for the
erection and maintenance of a chain of wirrless stations along the St.
Lawrence River and the coast of Labrador. The Canadian Marconi
Company is already earning from its operations, aside from Govern-
ment business, very considerable revenues. The Canadian revenue cut-
ters Stanley. Mlnto, Canada and Montcalm are all equipped with the
Marconi system.
Slh. Because th*' Marconi Company has.mnde co-operative commer-
cial alliances with thÂ« established telegraph svstÂ«?ms, and Marconi mes-'
snpre!< are now received at every Western Union. Postal Telegraph. Can-
rrii.-n Pacific Railroad. Great Northwestern and Dominion Tclearraph office

George P. Rowell's
! Rise to Fortune
i. Narrated.
; At 10 Spruce street, in New York
City, under the shadow ; of the struc
.tures occupied by the Tribune and the
Times. [- there is issued every week a
publication, called Printers' Ink, de
voted to matters of publicity. For sev
eral months, in serial form, it has pub
lished from the pen of George P.
Rowell, its founder, an article entitled
"Forty Years an Advertising Agent,"
which is probably the best history of
the growth of the advertising business
that, has ever appeared in print,-- :
Mr. Rowell has so interesting' a per
sonality, has in his long service as an
advertising agent' gained so - wide a
circle of friends and has. created, as
any strong man will, sueh 1 a consider
able amount of antagonistic feeling that
it is regrettable the interesting recital
of his experiences -are not to have a
wider publicity than that confined to
his own journal. It is a far. cry back
to 1563. when the Civil War was de
vastating so many thousansds of
American homes, but it .was in April
of that year, in a back officeâ rent
$150 a year â up two nights of stairs,
over a liquor store, in Congress street,
Boston, the firm of George P. Rowell &
Co.. advertising agents, commenced
business.
Mr. Rowell had served a seven years*
apprenticeship in the counting-room'of
the Boston Post and then, at the agre
of 26, having accumulated a, net in
debtdeness, over all assets, of $2000,
threw. up his situation and a salary of
$1S a week to enter upon "a business of
which he had" little knowledge and no
experience. His partner, Horace Dodd,
had nqt even the advantage of a news
paper office training. To him "solid,"
"leaded," "display,"' "electrotype,"
"agate" and "nonpareil" were, unknown
terms. Such a thing as a list of news
papers published in the United States
was not then accessible to the public.
FIUST OUTLAY; IS 90.
Shortly after putting out the sign
and issuing- with much care and hesi
tation, a circular which involved' \u25a0 an
outlay of J6, v the new firm received an
application from Scranton & Burr, sub
scription book^ publishers at Hartford,
for information about the cost of ad
vertising in New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia* Neither Rowell nor Dodd knew
so much as the name of a single paper
in either of the two provinces, but not
being pressed with business they had
time to seek the needed information.
. Visits-, were "paid, to -'the Boston news
paperfofflces for lists of .their. exchanges
from these regions. .In twenty-four
hours a list had been prepared -and a
price given. Nothing Is such a stum
bling block to a new advertising agent
as a card of rates, and this embarrass
ment these embryo agents escaped.
The order was received and sent out.
I Back it came from many. Some papers
were dead. Some had changed names,
consolidated, or changed from a weekly
to a dally or vfee versa. Others; were
so unnewspaperlike as to want'pay
ment before doing work for unknown
parties; finally, however, the applica
tion for agents to sell* the "History of
Methodism" (or was it "Beyond the
.Mississippi"?) had been inserted in a
good many papers and by taking; care
to charge the' advertiser enough and
not to offer to pay the publisher too
much there was a handsome profit,
provided Messrs. Scranton & Burr
should fail to, notice, that the - list of
papers named tm the bill bore scarcely
so much relation to the list named in
the estimate as the class of, a mission
ary Sunday-school in July does to the
same, school .catalogue made up the
preceding Christmas time. The bill
was made out with doubt and misgiv
ing. Rowell and Dodd went together
to the 'postoffice to mail the-all-Im
portant document And then ,they
waited! Fortunately the book was a
success; the publishers made./ money
and by return mail' came a check in full
payment for the bill, and \u25a0 for many
years' Scranton & Burr, who had sep
arated and afterward conducted dif
ferent houses,/ were among the most
constant and valued' patrons of this
youngest advertising agency.: .::./>:

credit was given for an article or item,
to note' the name in. a book for future
reference. Finally a list of newspapers
for a. single State was compiled and
printed and sent to all 'the T papers
named upon It and each publisher was
asked to return it with corrections. In
this way; as time went on the ; firm
finally became, possessed of -the names
of about .3000 papers in the United
States, and Canada. SsjiSEililÃa*
NOVEL SCHEME CONCEIVED.
When the ) business was, inaugurated
a novel scheme was conceived: and
worked out. The plan was to bargain
with 100 papers in New England,; an
other 100 in New York and so on for
other< sections. for a column of space
to be. used by the year and peddled out
to advertisers who should jÂ»ay $100 for_
an inch. to' be inserted in the 'whole, lot
for a month, ' The alliteration "$lOO for
100 papers" had a certain charm and
as the. average charge of the papers
for inserting, an inch a month .was
about >$2. ftO each theprice seemed low,
'enough. 7 ..-.There .was the additional
advantage.'' that- what ;,was sold for.
$100 -cost- only about $35,. so yj that
It sometimes only; half the space could
be sold there was still;. a | modicum of
profit.; So :well didithis plan- work that
while ; established agents ?,were j| unable
to -compete j.with'ithe^new^scheme 'the
first t yearls transactions of the new
agency showed a net profit,' after all
expenses! were, paid, of $10,000 on a
gross business of only $27,000. /.
It was soon noticed that the head
quarters of advertising; was New York
and in April, .. 1 8C7, Mr. Rowell opened
an office in the New York Times : build
ing. In that year Charles N. Kent be
came, and has ever ; since been, asso
ciated, with him in business. , In 1969
the American Newspaper Directory was
issued and then for. the first time every
body had access to a complete list of
newspapers. The number of newspa
pers in that first edition was about
5000. In 1905 it had increased to 22,704.
The American Newspaper. Directory
has opened a means of communication
between. v - advertisers â¢, and \u0084 = publishers
such as did ; not before: exist, and has
resulted in securing for. papers of j all
classes a, .very? considerable increase of
edvertising r patronage over what they
would otherwise have obtained.
' In-:l870 Rowell & Co. bought out the
business -of John Hooper,; the pioneer
advertising agent) in New \u25a0 York. Mr.'
Rowell was original in his methods and
never having had any training in an
advertising agency , he invented the
plans of conducting the business - and
these were conceived "with 'such good
judgment that the methods which have
prevailed in his office have been gradu
ally adopted by. all the successful agen-'
cies of _ the country. : , \u25a0â¢".'-.
. In 1876 Rowell '& Co. invested about
$25,000 in making an exhibit of ; newspapers
at the' Philadelphia Centennial ExhibN
tion/ : Eight . men . were, 'kept â¢'. there
throughout;, the entire six months while
the; show ; was; open. ; Every'',newspaper
in the country was on' file," and the vis- 1
itor from the most remote region could'
step- in and seei his ; home .paper." iAIl 1
of these papers were contributed to the
exhibition . by the'publishers^ without

Downing had been Assistant Postmaster

to have obtained entrance to his home
secretly and -were â¢ astonished when ' they

' /THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SUNDAY/^SEBTEMBER 17, 1905^
RAISES VOICE IN VAIN
TO CALL HIS SHIPMATE.
S^ARILESCOURTWriHSHOU^
Thompson Fails to
Produce His
Witness.
Mariner Convicted
of Breaking a
Window.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"Me shipmet." hoarsely growled Henry
Thompson, able seaman, "kin tell ye
'twuzn't me that broke th'-windy.V
"Well, bring on your shipmate and we'll
hear his testimony," said Police. Judge
Mogan. before whom Mr. Thompson was
accused of having committed malicious
mischief by^ deliberately falling against
and shattering the plate-glass front of a
notion store at 622 Kearny street.
Turning and facing the auditorium, Mr.
Thompson scanned the sea of faces and
then, apparently having * failed to find
what he sought, made a trumpet of his
hands and raucously \u25a0 bawled, "Are ye
there, Bhlpmet?" ;
There was no response, and with a sigh
Mr. Thompson relinquished his -quest and
Informed the court that he guessed his
shipmate had gone to sea.
"Wese both on th* "books o'th'Nebras
kan," he explained, "an' she's doo t'
start fr Honolulu today. Guess me shlp
rnet's aboard."
"Then we'll listen to your story of the
window-breaking," said the Judge. '
" 'Twas this way," he began. "Me an'
me shipmet's a-comin' along 'th' street
an* we. stops an' -looks into. a : windy.
Wese a-talkln, but not j dispootln', \u25a0 about
seme o* th' things wese a-lookin* at, an'
a lot o* people gathers 'roun' an' starts
a-jostlln* an' a-pushln' us. an' 'th' fust
thing we knows we're shoved through th'
glass. Me shipmet starts after th. bloke
what 'c thought pushed 'im, an* th'nex*
thing I knows a p'leecem'n hez*me. Mo
shipmet keeps on a-runnln', an' I haven't
seed *im since."
Mr. Thompson, under stress of interro
gation, confessed that he and his ship
mate had been drinking intoxicants quite
freely ere they halted at the notion store
â¢window, and he acknowledged also that
when he is under the influence of alcohol
his gait is unsteady. AH of which evi
dently satisfied the Judge that he would
be justified In pronouncing Mr. Thomp
son guilty and remanding him for sen
tence. N
â¢ o â¢
' Christian Hansen, Xels Nelson and Emil
Engell, entire crew of the - stanch scow
echooner Fredericka Frederickson, pro
tested against. the diminutive size of the
glasses in which beer was served to them
in a saloon at Clay and Kearny streets.
Speaking for the trio. Mr. Nelson in
formed the bartender that on the water
front more than twice as much beer could
be purchased for the sum he charged. , ,
â¢*We -ain't, glyin' no -.beer baths for fl'
cents per," was the response. 'y
"Ay ban hey goad mind toe hellep mine
selef," Mr. Nelson threatened, with eye
fastened on the beer kegs behind the
counter.
"Change, yer. mind if ye love yer fam
ily." rejoined the mixologist.
In the ensuing fight, precipitated by, Mr.
Nelsdi and his companions . advancing
upon the kegs, the bartender held the
odds even until police aid arrived. Judge
Conlan will sentence the mariners "three
for peace disturbance.
James B. Turner (colored) stole some
solder from the store of* Matteo Farno, 507
Pacific street, and a few hours later sold

to secure an entrance to Portland.
President Elliott's announcement, as
I given out by Charlton, follows:
I ."The' Great - Northern t and Northern
r Pacific companies have organized and
'own Jointly the Portland and Seattle
Railway Company. That company will
'< build a railroad as rapidly Â«i 3 men and
j material will permit from Kennewick.
i opposite Pasco. along the north bank of
the Columbia River to Vancouver,
Wash., bridge ' the Columbia and Wil
lamette rivers.' forming a connection
| with the present line of the Northern
Pacific north of Portland.- When the
railroad bridges are finished they will
give to the Great Northern and North
ern Pacific a first-class entrance to
Portland and a direct line to and from
the East."
S Supplementing President Elliott's an
nouncement Charlton said it is estimat
ed that - about two ' years ' will be re
quired to put the road in operation.
Articles of incorporation of the Port
j land and Seattle Railway Company
t were' filed at Olympla, Wash., yesterday,
the nominal Incorporators being Port

with any necessary branches.
The distance from I^ennewick to
Portland is a little more than 200 miles
and unofficial estimates place the cost
at approximately 112.500,000.

RfiflSOTtS * These pianos which we have reduced
in price are mostly made of oak, but in
the assortment are a few of mahogany. Many people
with artistic taste find that an oak piano does not har-
monize with the other furniture in the room as they
would wish. But we know there are some people who
buy a .piano for its tone and lasting qualities rather than
the finish of the instrument. As an inducement to
these buyers we have reduced the prices as above
mentioned.
Reductions * s yÂ° u seCj t^ le ret^ uct^ ons are about
20 per cent. This means a great
deal to you. The actual saving of $60, $70 or $80 on a
brand new piano is worth your consideration.
"TTpprnc â¢ E ven though the pianos are - considerably
* reduced, we will sell them as low as $6
down and $6 a month. These are the terms that other
dealers extend when selling a $200 piano at its regular
price. We allow the same terms when selling a $350 piano
at a greatly reduced price. We save you from 10 to 13
payments through our reduced prices this week. Buy now
and the piano is paid for one year quicker than if you
bought the instrument at its regular price.
GllSralltSG * ac^ P^ ano bears the Kohler & Chase
guarantee which protects you' now and
for years to come. It's a guarantee you will welcome now,
but truly appreciate ten years hence when your piano is
still in good condition after years of service. So come
this week â get a reliable piano, save a year's payments,
make a piano in your home a fact as well as a desire.

duty, but he says that one clause in the
bill seems ambiguous and reads as fol
lows:
"Repair pieces, by which are to be un
derstood such as form an integral part of
the machine for which they are intended,
ehall enjoy the benefits accorded by this
law only when they are imported with the
machines." !
The Minister has been Instructed to be
unceasing in his efforts to bring about a
satisfactory adjustment of the matter.
From some statements made to the de
partment by American' exporters it is sur
mised that the purpose of this new Ar
gentine legislation may be to stop a prac
tice which is said to have grown up of
evading larger tariff duties on machines
exported to the Argentine republic by
shipping In a large number of parts at a
lower rate of duty and assembling these
parts Into complete machines after their
admission into the country.

The man who Jumps at conclusions gel
dom lands on facts.
If the investment* is intelligently and wisely laadeâ if the prospective investor studies the
real estate tendencies of the timeâ if he carefttfly watches the drift of affairsâ if he exercises
sound common sense.
And what conclusion will such a one reach?
It is our sober belief that his conclusion will be that the drift of population is from
the ugliness. of cities to the pleasantness of suburbs, like Piedmont. In Los Angeles this move-
ment has long been very marked arid conUnoes in swelling volume. Ini San Francisco this
movement is redly just begmning-â tow wise and intelligent investor
will not fail to learn a lesson from the experience of other cities and seize the opportunity
that presents itself to acquire a lot in the suburb of Piedmont at # a reasonable price.
Piedmont Is the fairest of all suburbs, a place of gently rolling hills, with a view of sea
and bay; sunny, fogless; thirty minutes from the center of San Francisco, and equipped with
every improvement, such as sidewalks lined with palms and other fine trees, sewers, gas and
The raresti opportunity^eyer offered an investor is that, offered in Piedmont.
Have you the intelligence to perceive it., the courage to act?

ACCIDENTALY
KILLS BROTHER
Frank Mears Admits That He
Is Responsible for the
Death- of- His , Relative
MAKES A CONFESSION
Says He Was Carrying Grim
When Hammer Hit Door
and Caused the Fatal Shot
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VENTURA, Sept. 16.â The - death ,of
John W. Wears of Santa Paula Canyon,
who was found dead:ln*a chair in. the
Mears ranch-house last Friday; is no
longer a** mystery. His brother," Frank
Mears, ; to-day confessed to the killing,
but insists that it was an accident.
His cpnfession, made to his; sister
Florence, 1 immediately, after his prelim
inary examination at which he was held
for murder was to the effect that on
the day in question he was alone in the
house with John. The pair had been
shooting-* hawks about the place. John
went into the house and ; sat down.
Frank followed soon after with the gun
in his hand. In massing through the
door the hammer of the gun caught
and the. weapon was i discharged, the
load entering, the back- of John Mears'
head, killing him : instantly. . ..,..â¢
Mears declares that in his terror he
dropped the gun and rushed from the
house and : to the schoolhouse to tell his
sisters, who were pupils there. To a
teacher he said to tell his sisters John
had shot himself and was dead.', He
explains that he was so distracted by
what .had * happened that he scarcely
knew what-to say. .
This latter story he told at the in
quest and stuck to it until to-day. To
-the: officers .it .'did not sound probable,
and they; began an investigation, with
the result that they found a Mexican
who worked on the Mears ranch, who
said he was driving to the ranch on, the
day of the I killing and that when near
the house he heard a shot "within, and,
saw Frank Mears rush from the door.
Upon this evidence Frank was arrested
and charged I with his brother's murder.
-The Mears brothers are well-known
native sons. Their parents are" dead.
They were left - a valuable "property
which was managed by John Mears.
The confession' created a sensation.;

TOPEKA. Kans.,.Sept- 16. â The flood
situation here to-night is more serious.
The levees protecting the farming lands
along Soldier Creek have broken and
thousands of acres of corn fields are
under water. A wagon bridge across

Deprecate Acts \u25a0 of Mobs
in Japanese Cities as
Humiliating to Empire
NOT ANTI - AMERICAN
Official Statement Asserts
tlie Nation Is Friendly
to the United States
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.-An official re
port concerning the recent anti-treaty
riots in Toklo was to-day received by the
Japanese legation. On the basis of this
report Mr. Hlokt, Charge d 1d 1 Affaires ot
Japan, said to-day:
"My advices from Tokio do not attempt
to minimize the importance of affairs as
they existed.
"The immediate provocation of the
riotous outbreak was the action of the
police, who sooght to prevent a political
mass-meeting, and not the slightest feel-
Ing of hostility toward foreigners in gen
eral or Americans in particular entered
Into the spirit of the mob.
"Of course, there are many Japanese
who are disappointed at the terms of the
peace treaty, and It Is natural that they
should express their disappointment, but
the majority of the thinking class of my
country deprecate the riotous action anu
regret the Injurious Impression created by
these disturbances, which apparently led
some people to regard them as an indica
tion of a feeling of hostility on the part
of Japan toward, the United States.
"I am authorized to say that; notwith
standing what differences of opinion may
exist in Japan over the terms of peace,
there is a strong, united and friendly
feeling toward the -United States and
deep appreciation of the earnest, impar
tial and sincere good will which has at
tended the efforts of President Roose
velt."
KOMCRA USING DRUG.
Japanese Performer Says Baron Is Try-
Ing to Kill Himself.
SIOUX CITY, Sept. 16. â An improvised
method of hara kiri is being employed by
Baron Komura, the .Japanese plenipoten
tiary to the pca.ee conference, according to
Manager Takashita of the Japanese'
vaudeville performers appearing at the
Interstate Fair. Komura has chosen to
commit suicide by means of a subtle poi
son which will make it appear that he is
dying a natural death and not bring dis
grace upon him in America, at the same
time appeasing the wrath of his country
men. r->X-;V
Takashita eaid to-day: "His nation
has spoken. It demanded Komura's
death as the only means of atoning for
such a bad bargain with Russia. Hara
kiri means little to you In America. To
us it is the only means of redeeming him
self and enabling him to die a hero's
death."

The shops and offices remain closed.
Prince Louis Napoleon, the new Gov^
ernor General of the Caucasus, report
ing on the situation, confirms the re

under the eyes of the commissary of
police, who took no action and did not
even inform the military authorities.

TOKIO, Sept. 16. â According to re

OAKLAND. Sept. 16. â Pain's great
spectacle. "The Last Days of Pompeii,"

also been set up. The arena covers a
space of five acres and seats 10,000
people.

latter story and Police Judge Smith

MINISTER HITS
AT TOWN CLUBS
Liquor Problem Discussion
Has Unexpected End at
Temperance Folks' Meeting
LATHEOP DBOPS 80318
Unitarian Divine Asks Why
Fashionable Resorts of
Community Should Escape
BERKELEY. Sept. 16.â A bombshell
'was dropped by Rev. John Howland
Lathrop of the First Unitarian Church
at a meeting: last night of the confer'
"fence committee of Improvement clubs,
held In Trinity Methodist Episcopal
Church, when he declared, during a dis
cussion of the saloon problem in Berke
ley, that fashionable clubs In Berkeley
are quite as reprehensible as saloons
In West Berkeley arftt that he desired
a halt called In the practice of scoring
West Berkeley for its saloons until
such time as all the drinking places In
the town could be given attention.
The meeting of the conference com
mittee had been called to discuss the
measures necessary to get a prohibition
section in the proposed new charter
now being framed. ; A number of speak
ers, including several prominent min
isters, had denounced the conditions in
West Berkeley, where there is a score
of saloons. Sentiment apparently was
unanimous that West Berkeley needed
a lot of missionary work done in its
various parts and that official action
also should be secured to wipe out the
saloons there.
Then Rev. J. 1L Lathrop spoke, creat
ing a mild sensation with his words.
He said In part:
"If the people in West Berkeley want
saloons there must be some reason for
it. We should find out what part the
saloon plays in the life of the West
End. To be frank, what right have we
to eliminate saloons from West Berke
ley when we have the same under a
different name In East Berkeley? The
clubs in this part of the town act In
part in the same capacity as the sa
loons in West Berkeley. It Is only a
matter of names. I am not out of
sympathy with the meeting, Dut I sug
gest that a halt be called so that we
may get a comprehensive view of the
whole situation.
"The clubs as drinking places are an
evil, as are the saloons. If the evil
of liquor drinking is to be eliminated
let us eliminate it from the entire
town. The saloon in West Berkeley Is
the club of the working man and if
you deprive him of that you are taking
something out of his life without rec
ompense apparently. In the East End
the lack of saloons is compensated for
by the fashionable social clubs, where
as much liquor as is desired may be
maintained."
No rejoinder was made to Mr. Lath
rop's argument and the conference
committee adjourned â without taking
definite action In the matter. Other
conferences are to be held, when a de
cision as to what course to pursue to
secure a prohibition feature in the
charter will be made.

the board at an early date.

MAYFIELD. Sept. 16. â Palo Alto was
scored Friday night at a meeting of
the local Board of Trade by Contractor
Olson, who said the business men of
Palo Alto belonged to the Coast Coun

sort of selfish spirit should be put down.
Mayfleld citizens are angry at the

lated numerous Instances of narrow es

request that the Southern, Pacific stop

released this morning on | $2500 cash ball
advanced by Attorney Grove 1 L. Johnson.
Wright's bonds were, fixed at $5000 by Su
perior Judge Hart or half that amount In

risking his own gold in a' gamble that
Wright will not decide to leave the State
before being called to 'trial, or whether
the pile of twenties was \u25a0 gathered i " to

mains, however, that Johnson holds the

the young butcher of Mountain \Vlew.

made a; thorough investigation,' and late
to-night decided that Blasius'; death was
caused by a fall from a . surrey while

THUGS MURDER
YOUNG WOMAN
Fifty New York Detectives
Are at Work on a Mys
terious Strangulation Case
VICTIM, NOT IDENTIFIED
Evidence Indicates That
She Fought Desperately
Against the Assassins
NEW YORK, Sept. 16. â The finding
to-day of the body of a handsome young
woman, about 26 : years of age, lying
bruised and battered In a clump of briar
bushes. near .the Pel ham \ road, in the
Bronx, : revealed one of. the worst crimes
with which the police have had to deal
in many: years. An . autopsy to-night
showed that the woman had been choked
to death. There was every indication
that she had fought her j assailants des
perately. Her garments i were torn al
most to shreds. To-night the body rests
in the Fordham morgue," while fifty de
tectives are endeavoring to establish the
victims' Identity and to find some clew
to ,the murderers. -.-
The physicians were jof the
opinion that "the woman had .'been dead
about twelve hours.. Evidence points
to the fact that "at least two' men were
implicated in the crime. That the
woman was robbed is- not : doubted, for
nothing of value was left on her person,
while her fingers show that rings which
she must have worn were torn from
them. .
The girl , was 5 feet 2 inches in
height, of fair complexion, i with brown
hair and blue eyes.
An empty dress suit case was found
near the scene of the crime, but neither
In this nor on any. article of clothing
was there the slightest means of Iden
tification. * ,:.; \u0084-;jT' c .v..

DEFIES MOST
DEFT FORGER
Paper on Wiiick Notes of
Bank of England Are Print
ed Has Never Been Imitated
SEGKET WELL GUARDED
Colors Defy â¢Reproduction by
Aid of Camera, While Hand
Work Is Alike Impossible
The Bank of England note 1* the most
easily forged of all, for it is the simplest,
consisting as It does of black printing on
a white paper. The great safeguard lies
in : the quality of the . paper, the quality
of the printing and the watermark on the
paper. ; â¢
To make the actual paper Is beyond the
skill of the cleverest forger. It is made
at a small town near London, but so well
has the secret been guarded that the
most skillful note printers In the trade
do not understand that, though they
know most of the other secrets.
Note printing is one of the highly skill
ed trades which still is a virtual mo
nopoly of the city of London. It has al
ways been so and the great banks of
the world' come to the ~ engravers and
printers of London to have- their notes
or their plates made. They turn out the
most beautiful printing in Europe. Some
of it Is of the most complicated descrip
tion, and in this fact lies Its great
safety. ,
The steel plate Itself ts the work ; of
many hands and many brains: When the
main design has been decided upon the
parts of the picture have to be given
over to several engravers, each of whom
is skilled in one branch of his art and
could not exchange his part with any of
the others.
SUBDIVISIONS OP WORK.
One Is an architectural engraver, and
with a fine needle he labors for weeks In
the effort to convey to the metal a per
fect picture of ' a building. Another, with
skill of quite a different sort, makes por
traits, a third draws scenery, while a
fourth fashions the letters. Still others
contrive corner pieces, and then there Is
the" machine engraving, which is more
wonderful still, for the machine does
work so fine that no j human hand can
imitate it.
The complicated work of tracery which
you see on the back and front of Scotch
and foreign notes is so minute that the
camera cannot effectively copy It. To
reproduce with photography on zinc it
is necessary to employ a^cid and the acid
would ' eat away these fine lines. The
work is done by a machine which Is made
on the principle of the pantograph. It
seems to consist of a multitude of wheels
and eccentrics and apparatus for guiding
and checking the needle and sending it
in new directions at all sorts of unex
pected-angles and. curves.; - \u25a0;. =.'< . -
OPERATOR NOT IN SECRET.
After the design has been worked out
on the machine In accordance j with the
secret code, '.which Is kept by the proprie
tor locked in \u25a0 the : safe, the machine does
the. work itself If the operator will go
on turning the. driving crank slowly and
steadily. The plan is taken out with
numbers, which represent the wheels and
the. code qf figures, showing the work
which is to be done by each wheel and
how It comes into play. But the opera
tor cannot know that secret. The ma
chine simply goes on In Its own way and
the least slackening of any of the parts
will Dut it all out. - A workman cannot
repair the error, for he does not know
the code, and the whole work will be

resets the wheels and other parts in their

Only 'a small part of the design -is
worked out by this - delicate machine â
just enough to give a complete represen
tation of the pattern. Then that portion
is stamped off on soft steel, which is
hardened by another secret process and
made into a sort of a die, which Is used
to impress other plates of steel till the
full border is thus completed or a band

of the note.
COLORS DEFY CAMERA.
In the best l of the colored notes three
or four tints are used, and generally you
find that * one *of ' them Is blue. It de
fies the camera.- The different colors are
put on : with different plates and each
means a separate printing. . The result
is-.that if you hold one of the notes up
to the light ;\u25a0 you will find that the lines
of the different colors run into and
through one another, making it impos
sible ito take a perfect , copy even If the
camera could catch them all, which It
cannot. .
No forger can get the tracery done by

and he cannot get the machine. If he
had the machine it would take years to
work out the secret combination of fig
ures which make any particular design.
There are only three or four, of these
machines in . the world. Then for his
design, in the shape of portraits and arÂ«
chltecture and scenery and lettering, he
would want a combination of four or
more engravers of high ability and bad
character, which . would be as hard to
come by as the machine. It cannot be
done. v.
But the English note is protected by
none of these things. Its lettering and
general design can be copied quite as
easily by the camera and a good plate
reproduced on zinc for printing. It can
be photographed on stone . and the print
ing is ready at. once if the forger; can
get paper, of. the right sort.

for many years .been $1 a day, most 'of
which goes . for necessities,- the , cost lot
living here, being very high, 'and It is im
possible for the native to save more than
a few cents a day from his dollar. . , ;
\u25a0 Upon being x notified that their pay was
to be reduced to 8j cents -per â¢ day, the
laborers affected held a meeting and de
cided to- quit work, ; and upon belngjcall

One of : the -natives, a Fijian," blessed

who was threatened by the ; Governor with
Jail, told , the Governor that^he was. a

WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.â A proposition
is being considered in the Navy Depart
ment for removing the navy yard from
Bremerton to a site on Lake Washing
ton near Seattle, the discovery having
been made that the remoteness of Bre
merton from sources of supply and the
labor market has been a serious handi
cap. This argument was used original
ly against the location of the navy
yard at Bremerton, but Congress went
ahead and expended more than $1,500,
000 on the plant that is now admitted
to be poorly located. Seattle Influences
are at .work. It is said, to persuade Con
gress to relocate the yards.
-Word has been sent to Mare Island

LAST PRICES
THE HIGHEST
NEW YORK. Sept. 16.-There was a
burst of animation with the closing deal
ings in stocks to-day, making the last
prices the highest of the week and at con
siderable gains over last week's closing.
To-day's market was very dull until after
the appearance of the bank statement,
and was similar to Its predecessors of the
week In being largely professional in its
character. The undertone was strong
throughout, as confidence was strong that
the banks would manage to conserve their
showing of a surplus reserve by the shift
ing of loans to trust companies and other
institutions, as was done last week.
The appearance of the bank statement
justified this confidence, and was followed
by the final outburst of demand, which
made the closing strong. The loan reduc
tion, while very heavy, was only about
two-thirds as large as the unparalleled
contraction effected last week. The de
cline in cash reserves was up to the com
mon expectations. Stock market comment
shifted to the prospect of further gold
Imports next week as a relief from the
continued drain upon the bank reserves
by the sub-treasury absorptions and the
movement of funds to the interior. Re
ports from London of a demand for gold
upon that center from other sources were
studied with interest as a bearing upon
the chances of securing for New York the
large shipments of gold now moving to
ward London from South Africa and Aus
tralia. Of special Interest was the report
that Paris was competing to secure some
part of these expected arrivals.
If London becomes hard to
maintain her gold supply "It Is* expected
that the demand from New York will be
shifted from that center to Paris.
The special strength of Canadian Pacific
in the market was due to the report of an
offer for the purchase of the company's
land holdings. Chesapeake and Ohio re
flected the strong showing of its annual
report. Some special demand also con
tinued for the Wabash Issues.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $1,230,000.
ROLLER SKATING.
A Craze In the KnÂ«t.
That king of all winter sports, roller
skating, with the advent of a new pat
ent ball-bearing roller skate, has sud
denly sprang Into popularity again.
Every city and village in the East has
a rink.' The fact that the very J best
class of people have taken hold of this
sport tends to make it more popular
than ever. ": :.'\u25a0 \u25a0'\u25a0;'-:Â».i\,.
There are other reasons, too, why
roller skating In the large cities is more
popular than ever. One of them Is be
cause rinks are being conducted In a
much different manner- now than they
were back in the eighties. For. Instance,
twenty years ago a man could go into
the rink business on two hundred dol
lars, while to-day it costs from four to
eight thousand dollars to equip a first
class rink, owing to the price paid fox
first-class ball-bearing skates. There
fore it has become necessary for the
man with this amount of money invest
ed to study the business thoroughly.
All up-to-date roller skating rink man
agers agree that there is but one way
to run a rink successfully, and that Is
by eliminating the use of liquor in any
form in the rink and to reserve the
right to refuse admittance to any whom
the management might deem objection
able. In order to have a place of amuse
ment where a brother can take his sin
ter, or sweetheart or a father can take
his wife and children, knowing that the
moral atmosphere of the place is whole
some.
We understand that the main part of
the Mechanics' Pavilion has been leased
to Eastern parties for a roller skating
rink, and that the \u25a0 opening will take
plsvce October. 2. If run In the proper
manner we predict a "great success, as
people will certainly, welcome a change
In amusements.

SON OF A RICH
MAN A SUICIDE
Young: Soutlierner Hangs
Himself After Squander
ing- Periodical Allowance
SPENDS ALL ON WOMEN
Told by Father to Shift
for Himself Until Next
Installment Became Due
NEW YORK. Sept. IP.â The body of the
suicide who ended his life by hanging last
night at Mammaroneck, near this city,
was positively identified ' to-day ds that
of a young' man who had represented
himself to be William A/ King, son of a
wealthy cotton mill owner of Augusta,
Ga. The identification was made by Mrs.
George E. Jardlne, at whose house young
King stopped for shelter last Monday
during the height of a" severe storm.
The identification was confirmed by Mrs.
Jardine's son.. j-'&'Jt.'
Young King had told Jardlne that he
was penniless, having spent all of the al
lowance from his father. He had been
warned by the latter that if he overlived
his income he ' would have to shift for
himself until the next installment was
due. King said he had met a number ot
women while stopping in New York and
had squandered his money on them.
It was at first reported that the suicide
was Paul Kelly, motorman of the ele
vated railroad train which was wrecked
recently with a loss of twelve lives. ,
In an unaddreseed note which King. left
In his room he named a Baltimore man
as the cause of his trouble. Tue note also
said that the writer had had a good time
since his arrival in New York. To it was
pinned a $2 bill, the purpose of which, he
letter said, was to reimburse the hotel
people for the inconvenience to which his
death might put them.

BLADDER AND PROSTATIC
TROUBLE IN AM OLD HAIt
QUICKLY CURED BY ...
E E c 2 RO ;Â£ BE ESE
This Is a good picture or another old Cali-
fornia r-ioneer of Bakersfield, Cal.. Mr. Ben-
jamin H. Carter. Mr. Carter suffered for years
w-Ufc rheumatism. He dosed and dosed and
doted with medicines, but. as in most case*.
medicines did him no good. He -went to dU-
ferent eprings and epent lots ol money at ho-
tels and boarfilr^-houses. Â»\u25a0 â¢ ;-\u25a0*Â«
The cprinrs would help him tor a little
\u25a0while, but pocn as he rot back home the rheu-
matism would gradually return.
A few years ago the rheumatism began to
be complicated with bltlder irritation and. en-
larged prostate. The t^fferer would have to
ret up majry times during the night, which,
of course, spoiled his rest and finally began to
affect the nervous system and bis general
health began to fall. Occasionally the urine
had to be drawn and this caused great suf-
fering, owing to the Irritated condition of the
bladder.
It Just took three' months for Electro-Chemlc
home treatment to cure this bad case. After
having suffered for years, and after having
tpent hundreds and hundreds of dollars with-
out relief, to think that In three months' time,
at a trifling expense, be was cured at his boms
by Electro-Chemistry seems truly wonderful.
Patients living at a distance are loaned a
complete Electro-Chemlc apparatus for the ap-
plication of Electro-Chemistry. They use It
until cured, then return It. They don't have
to buy It.
It is always best for outslj* patients to come
to the In*tltute onre for a' personal examina-
tion. Â»o there can be no possibility of a mis-
take !n diagnosis.
The proper treatment can be prepared, the
i'fe of the apparatus explained and the patient
can return to his or her home the same day,
taking the proper treatment along.
No woman, no matter what her trouble' may
be. should think of -undergoing surgical treat-
ment before investigating and positively know-
-i*>.g just what Electro-Chemistry is accomplish-
in? in bad female disorders.
ElectrcwChemistry cures cancers, tumors, dis-
rl&c^ments, irregular and painful periods,
weakness, headache, backache, nervousness.
sleeplessness, melancholia.
In the diseases of the air passages, catarrh,
consumption, astbma. bronchitis, deafness,
ringing ears and head noises, almost hopeless
cases have been promptly cured, and in the
milder cases it never falls. In all stom-
ach, liver and bowel diseases Electro-Chemis-
try cures from the very begrlnnlng most serious
srsd long standing raFes. This is also true in
tad kidney and bladder troubles and in epe-
ciai diseases of men. Tounp men who are ncr- â¢
nous and fuffering from weakness and loss of
nervous and muscular strength can hardly real-
ize how promptly Electro-Chemistry will cure
them after medical treatments iiave absolutely
failed. In old men suffering from prostatlc ,
trouble? relief is Immediate and the cures are
prompt and r^rmanent.
In all specific blood and skin diseases Elec-
tro-Chemistry cures the very worst cases quick-
ly, cheaply and permanently.
CocsiiJtation lA the office or by letter In all
cases is free. Examination Is also free. There
are private apartmer.te for the accommodation
of the maJe and female patients.
ThÂ» Electro-Chemlc Institute, the only one
on thÂ« Pacific C^ast. is now located on the

equipped rooms. The office hours are?' from 9

SCHOONER IN COLLISION
WITH ANCHORED SHIP.
Sequoia, Inward Bound, Runs |lntol the
Charles E. Moody Off Presidio.
There was a coll 1 eon on the bay Fri
day night and as a result there is -work
for rigfgrers and ship carpenters on two
recently arrived sailing: vessels. The
schooner Sequoia, bound in, collided
with the ship Charles E. Moody off the
Presidio. The weather was thick, the
\u25a0wind on which the i schooner came in
light and when the Moody loomed up
ahead a smash waa Inevitable. For a
time the greatest confusion reigned.
The Sequoia later was hauled away,
from the Moody and taken to a safe
anchorage. Yesterday \u25a0morning ac
count was taken of the damage.
The Moody** headgear and stem were
badly damaged and in doing the harm
to the anchored sailing vessel the Se
quoia nearly wrecked herself. Her
spanker boom, gaff and mlzzen rigging
on the starboard side were carried
away, the port quarter was badly
chafed and other damage was sus
tained.

" ' " T-^J^ >S ~^V'. \ \t J IJy y^Ctfl^ ~~ ~~~-'-- \u25a0 electricity- to develop physical strength and endurance. I?octors who want

"" '. " ! " ' â¢~^^^^^^^>^-^r^7?^^^l^~-^i^-â Ji âr~_. x a want of vitality. The "day of the stimulating drug is past.
\u25a0_!L-J"^^nlP^^^l.^^ ??--' ; : You see they are all' coming to it. They wouldn't recommend ray belt
'. â -i^*^Zt--^i^s^^^l^^V> :^^^ âstill a few of the good doctors, do. recommend it when they care more
_^j^^Â£^2^Wfc'p^^>^7[^^ for a man's health than they do for his dollars â but most of them call me
" ==:: ~^^^^^if^" r '^^ - a. quack because I pay for my advertising. But tKey all- admit that elec-
. ' â¢ tricity increases strength. That is all I claim for it. That's all you want,
anyway. If you have enough strength you'll never be weak, nor suffer pain.
It used to be considered sensible to take drugs. to "wake up',\ sluggish circulation, to stimulate weak nerves, to make the stomach take food N
that it was too weak to digest, and then another drug to drive this food through the intestines, which were too weak to do their work. Men would
take drugs to make them sleep and an eye-opener in the morning to make them feel as if they had rested â all dope.'
It is well-known novy that nearly every drug contains from one-half to nine-tenths alcohol, and the rest poison. I'm no advocate of the intem-
perate use of .alcohol,- but' if you have to take it, why can't you take it without the poison? It is proven that in thirty minutes after a drug is
taken the physical . vitality is five per cent lower than before taking the drugâ that ; is, 1 after the stimulation has passed off.
Taking stimulants is like borrowing .'money -for; half an* hour at'five per cent dnterestâ you borrow a dollar axtd pay back a dollar five in half
an hour. If that scheme kept up it would break your bank account; it will just as surely. break you down physically. Wouldn't it?
Nature will stand a great deal of punishment, but she will not stand it always. She gives you a strjong body to start with, and demands an
accounting. â¢'..â¢\u25a0 : . ' â¢ ..\
My method is to help natureâ to add artificial vitality to that you already have. Every one of us has a certain amount, according to our
strength, because vitality is strength.. When you lose some of this vitality you are weakâ a weak man. My appliance pours a fresh supply into
your body while you sleep:- It generates electricity and pumps that into your nerves. . Professor Loeb says that it is the basis of vitality, and ray
cures prove it. ' >, * \u25a0- ' ' -
.'. V Mr. E. B. J Budg:e,. 1915*"Amador street. Fresno, Cal., writes: "All signs of the weakness, the lmpotericy and the premature discbarge of -which I
complained have passed away. A few. months ago f was a very, sick man. and this weakness had , sone so far- as to affect my digestive organa, but
now lam up and around and attending to my business .without* any trouble at all. In fact, I fegl well enough to make a-trip to the Tosemite. I have had
several opportunities to recommend your Belt, and I alwaysflnd it a pleasure to say 'all the good things the treatment deserves."
\u25a0\u25a0.: . Now, if ;yo.u-. don't feel right, I can cure you with my Electric Belt.. If you are" full of rheumatic pains, I can knock them out. ' I can pour !
oil 'into your joints and limber them; up. I have often said that pain and electricity can't live In the same house, and I. prove it every day.
If it were not! for Ihe prejudicedue to- the great number of fakes in the land I would not be able to handle the business that would come to
me. The "Free Belt" fraud and the "Free Drug" scheme, which are not free at all, have made every one skeptical, but I'know. that 'l have a good
thing, and I'll 'hammer away ..until you know' it.
v \u25a0 One thing every man- ought to know is this: "Your body is a machine. It is run bythe steam in your blood and nerves. When you begin â¢
to break dovvn in, any .way. you are out of steam. That's what I want. to give you back.;.
'; Mr. p L. J. Berryessa. Piedmont Road, San Jose,. Cal., writes: "In making my final report of the work .of the Belt. I -must say that It has done well. :
all that could be expected, and mine was a very severe case, indeed. A broken down condition of the system, induced by a bad case of varlcocele. stomach
trouble and asthma, were a few- of the symptoms that wrecked my happiness, but lam completely cured of all these troubles, well and strong In every way,
and am only too glad to show my appreciation of what you have done for me." ... .
V \u25a0 -I have a cure in every town. Tell me where you' live and I will s giye you the name of a man I've cured.
Tell me your trouble and I will tell you honestly whether. I can cure you or not. If I can't cure you I dont want your money. I have been

Yankee Scheme to :Eaise
Produce in Big Cities
PHILADELPHIA IS CITED
"Potato Patch" of the Quaker
Town Is to Be Duplicated
in Capital of England
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON, Sept. 16.â Chief among' the
objects aimed at by the "Country in
Town" Exhibition Conference shortly
to be held In London is the starting of
a movement for. utilizing vacant build
ing sites as farm and market gardens,
as Is .done In Philadelphia and some
other big. American cities. * One of the
leading promoters of the scheme is the
veteran co-operator, E. O. Greening. In
conversation : with your : correspondent
he frankly acknowledged that it was
the "splendid, example of Philadelphia"
which had prompted him and his asso
ciates to , agitate for the adoption of
similar methods here. . -
"The facts and figures which we have
collected," he said, . "show that the 'po
tato patch* scheme, as Philadelphians
good-naturedly call It, has been emi
nently successful. During the first flye
years the plan was in operation In
Philadelphia the public had. to: sub
cribe only. $15,000, while the workers
benefited. to the extent of nearly $85,
000. It has been proved that it pays
and does not pauperize. And this dem
onstration will' 1 be : of great value to us
in ' appealing to . the : practical 'f minded
British public, which *is prone, to be
skeptical about untried experiments.
. "We cite the results achieved in
Philadelphia . as \u25a0 proof \u25a0 that ; no ;bit â¢of
vacant land need be wasted. The waste
that has thus occurred In" the past is
sad to contemplate. There are' always
a large number of vacant building; plats
in London and many of Â» them stand
vacant -for years.- I: have "known large
areas in Deptford. to remain" in' a desert
condition for" twenty : years. All.; that
time' a crowded . population, of .working
men and women! were cooped up : In ,the
little streets around, sighing for, a bit
of garden. Oir.theilsle.of s Dogs r a great
district ; lay ; waste for ' years.' ' Even in
Parliament : street * the ' site now > being
covered !, by, the .new-War^, Office ./lay

ist found' there no! less than* sixty vari

themselves ; inside I. the y forbidding j pal^

ly what"is : ; wanted- is an -association
which i can ;bring ? the i principle '{, of 'â¢" co

holders who happen to be dispossessed.
I hope to see the 'Country in Town"
Exhibition Conference 'form such an
association. U' .t -
: "It is not our purpose," added Mr.
Greening, "to work on exactly the same
lines In this matter as is done in Phila
delphia. Our object is to .make use
of vacant sites In London not so "much
for the as for the. man in
work who could . cultivate his plat in
the evening. So far as the unemployed
are concerned Mr. Fels, who was asso
ciated with the Philadelphia: scheme in
its earlier stages, has already - intro
duced the principle of farm colonies
into this country."

features of its work it will set an ex

STEPHEN OUSTED
FROM HIS JOB
President of Health Board
Formally Orders Dismis
sal of the Chief Surgeon
DR. MILLAR APPOINTED
Takes Place of Disgraced
V Official, Who, Mayor Now
Says, Was "Indiscreet"
Dr. Junes W. Ward, president of thÂ«
Board of Health, yesterday formally
ordered the dismissal of Chief Emer
gency Surgeon John I. Stephen from
his position because of Irregularities
in the performance of official duties.
Dr. Ward directed Health Officer Ragan
to Install Dr. Charles F. Millar In the
position mad* vacant. The action of
the president will be ratified by the
Board of Health when it meets next
Thursday morning. Dr. Millar assumed
his duties as chief emergency surgeon
Â«.t once.
Dr. Stephen was asked for his res
ignation immediately after the. ugly
disclosures made in connection with the
suicide of Archibald Ralston in Del
rnonico's. Stepnen had also brought
another scandal on the Schmitz admln
istnation, it is alleged, through his ac
tions with a nurse in the Emergency
Hospital service. The doctor had in
formed several of his intimates that he
would not resign and would fight any
attempt at his removal.
"When Dr. Ward heard of Stephen's
utterances he at once communicated
with Health Officer Ragan and in
structed the latter to locate Stephen
and demand his instant resignation.
Ragan began the quest for Stephen, but
after several hours was unable to find
Mm. Eany in the afternoon Stephen
*j\Â»r:g up the main health office and
tsked for Ragan, but was told to go to
Ragan's private office.
Stephen did not make any attempt to
find Ragan and the latter, after tele
phoning to various places where Ste
phen was supposed to be, gave up the
hunt. Ragan thereupon reported-to Dr.-
Ward that he had used due diligence
to locate Stephen, but without success.
It was then that Ward ordered Ste
phen's removal.'
Mayor Schmitz now says that it was
decided to oust Stephen not because
he had done any wrong, but because
he had been "indiscreet."

LEAGUE FORCES FIRM
Democratic Local Convention
Will Meet and Organize
Next Thursday Evening'
The Democratic .Municipal Conven
tion, consisting- of 335Â» delegates, -will
meat and organize at Pioneer Kail next
Thursday evening:. The convention will
be called to order .by Thomas W.
Hickey, chairman of the Democratic
County Committee.
The majority caucus of delegates to
the Republican local convention was
called to order at Pioneer Hall last even
ing- by Daniel A. Ryan. The caucus ad
journed to meet again at the call of the
chairman.
The organization committee of the
San Francisco Republican League met
yesterday afternoon at 636 Market
street and adjourned to meet to-morrow
afternoon. Topics relating to coalition
of Republican and Democratic forces.
were discussed.
The Republican local convention, con
sisting of 38S delegates, will meet and
organize at the Alhambra Theater next
Tuesday evening. The convention will
be called to order by Charles Sonntag.
chairman of the Republican County
Comittee. â¢
Progress of registration at the City
Hall convinces leaders in the battle for
creditable lofki government that the
vote cast on November 7 will exceed
70,000. The league has a list which
contains the name of every unregistered
citizen of the metropolis. The system
employed by the league for bringing
out the exceptionally large primary
election vote is being effectively applied
to the work of bringing out a full reg
istration of voters for the election in
November.
The incident is still fresh in the
mind of the* public that the grafters on
the day before the primary election
boasted that Ruef would carry every
Assembly district of the town. Many
weak-hearted Republicans were de
pressed by the boasts of the enemy and
were ready to give in before the bat
tle. The grafters are again resort
ing to the old game of "bluff." assert
ing that Ruef will win out by 20,000
majority. The facts are that the wage
earners .are not'Snovf'J as ' Enthusiastic,
for Ruef s candidate : as : they - were two
years ago. when Schmitz got \ 26.000
votes. Ruef knows that he -will be a
dead cock in the pit on November 7 At
Republicans and: Democrats coalesce,
hence he is working overtime to balk
fusion and" divide the forces- of good
citizenship.
Several of the anti-Ruef delegates
know what inducements have been of
fered by the grafters to defeat fusion
of Republicans and Democrats. The
gangsters have gone to the verge, the
very brink of bribery, in their solicita
tion of support. There is not- the
slightest indication of a fall-down on
the part of , any delegate in the anti-
Ruef column. In fact, a change of
front by any delegate of the league
forces would be viewed with grave sus
picion. \
Ruef's candidate for Mayor is not
gaining strength In any Assembly dis-.
trict of the*cityand is not anything
like as invincible as his followers
would have voters imagine. The bat
tle against Ruef was more than half
won when the Republican League
elected 231 delegates to the convention.
The same sort of. earnest work that
characterized the league's campaign foÂ»
the primary, will result in a complete
victory over the Ruef gang at 'the polls
on November 7. Every unregistered
wage earner, salaried, man, clerk,
banker, merchant, lawyer, doctor and
capitalist,' who is sincerely- in favor of
taking the reins of local government
out of the hands of Boss Ruef, should
get on the register at once. Any delay
in registration is dangerous. .Â»

PHOTO CEREMONY

Pretty Miss Nui From the

Spouse in American Style
PICTURE RITE INVALID
Immigrant Inspector H. A. S.
Perscli Does Not /Deem
Japanese Custom Lawf ul
Risaburo Fukuda of the houseclean
ing company at 3034 Sacramento street
was married. yesterday in" Miss Lake's
mission to a beautiful young Japanese
girl, whom he had never seen before.
Under Japanese law and custom r she
had been his bride since last Febru
ary, for ' in that month, in the moun
tains of : Nara in her own, picturesque
country, she was married 'to him by
photograph â that is. the photograph of
the bridegroom took the place of that
rather important factor of the wedding
ceremony, . â¢ Mr.; Fukuda being at- \u25a0 the
time in San Francisco.
The girl arrived here on the steam
ship Manchuria last Thursday and was
the only one of the Japanese passen
gers found by the quarantine officers
not affected with a contagious disease,
the remainder being detained in quar
antine or refused landing.
When United States Immigrant In
spector H. A. S. Persch heard of the
photograph marriage he refused to al
low the girl to land unless she and
Fukuda would become husband arid wife
according to American, law. . Nui was
accordingly taken as a prisoner to Miss
Lake's mission and was handed? over
to the custody of her husband imme
diately after the wedding. \u25a0 "- .
The affair was arranged by S. Uchlda,
a friend of the groom. The mountains
of Nara are noted for their beautiful
Shinto temples and handsome women.
When Mr. Uchida's eyes fell upon the
lovable Nui he at once selected^her as
a fitting bride for his friend, at that
time in this city wearing somewhat'
rusty widower's weeds. Uchida had the
photograph and the girl liked the looks
of the widower. She was at once
married _ to the. photograph, promising
at the same time to love, honor and
obey the original.
Before the wedding could take place
here It was also necessary that the
groom should present to , the Immigrant
authorities recommendations of good
moral character and. of ability to sup
port aiwife. â¢\u25a0-.''â¢ .â¢',..'" -'"' :' '

" United States Senator Thomas C. Platt
of New York, accompanied by his young
wife and a party .of friends, arrived here
yesterday from the south In a private car
and is registered at the Palace Hotel.
Senator Platt" 3 appearance fully substan
tiates the recent reports from the East
of his failing health. That he was In
very bad health' -was plainly evidenced
In bis walk yesterday when he entered
the Palace on the arm of his wife and the
feeble utterances made when acknowledg
ing the greetings of old friends who were
at the hotel to meet him. Too . weak to
even register the names of his party, the
Senator left that duty to his wife, and
when the task was finished he bestowed
a faint smile upon those who had assem
bled about him. Taking his wife's arm,
he slowly shuffled off to the elevator.
The balance of the day the Senator re
mained in his apartments, excusing him
self to callsrs on the plea that he was
greatly fatigued after his overland jour
ney. The s/ime plea was sent to news
paper men who sought to Interview him.
and the only statement given out was
that the Senator and his party contem
plate remaining In San Francisco five
days, when they will return to the
East. The report that Senator Platt on
his Western tour has been dodging the
service of papers on him by the lawyers
of Miss Mac Wood, who is now in New;
York threatening . to sue him for breach '
of promise, was strenuously denied by a
member of the Senator's party, who said:
"Senator Platfs proposed trip to the
coast was known to nearly everybody in
New York several week 3 before he em
barked upon it. and If any service of pa
pers was contemplated it cculd have been
effected there, either upon the Senator or
through the medium of his attorneys. Nor
has the Senator come West to avoid any
threatened suit. On the contrary, he was
ordered to make the trip by his physi
cians, and the fact that he returns al
most directly to New York five days
hence upsets the theory, if any such the
ory exists, that he is dodging trouble
with: Miss Wood or any one else. There
is' no denial that is a very, sick man.
but he has not lost hope of recovery, la
fact, he is much Improved since his jour
ney began, ancT to those who have been
with him his spirits seem a great deal
brighter."
! The fact that Senator Platt was too ill
to leave his apartments yesterday d!d not
deter ' his wife . and the fair members of
the party from doing so. In the afternoon
Mrs. Platt and her friends made a tour k
of the downtown portion of the city and
made a few purchases and returned to the
hotel. Mrs. Platt Is an exceedingly j at- *
tractive woman, who is taking a deep in
terest in the welfare of her invalid hus
band and Is said to be of valuable assist
ance to him In the transaction of minor
affairs of .business that he Is permitted to
give his attention to.
. Besides . Senator and Mrs. Platt there
are in . the party Mrs. Gay " Robertson of
.Washington." Mrs. ,W.j E.' Rugby of New
York, Miss M. L. Snow of New York and
J. K. Hedges.

Wsuilildclob Crop Bolletla.
ThÂ» report of O. N. Eallsbm-y, section di
rector, United State* Weather Bureau, for the
Washington, Crop Bulletin, week ended Sep
tember 12. Is a* follow*:
The weather of the past week was warm
and dry throughout the eastern counties, and
therefore favorable for harvesting. There were
chowers in the western counties, which In the
cxtrerae northwest were quite heavy, delaying
threshing axd oaueing. It 1* thought, some
damage to cats in, the shock. Pastures were
oonslderably freshened and forest fires ex
â¢ tlcgulshed.
In the southern counties there was no rain
and pastures are drying up. Corn, tomatoes.
punsr>klr.Â» and squashes are ripening \u25a0well. The
pi-use crop, although good In some districts. Is
generally poor. In Clarke County the Italian
prunes are shriveling up aad falling badly.
Pears and fall apples are plentiful. Late
potatoes were benefited by the rain In the
northwest counties, but In the southern coun
* ties some blight is reported. The oat harvest
is well along toward completion In the western
counties. In the La Conner district the Indi
cated yield in below average and not as plump
ac usual, although latest reports are more en
" couragmg.
Owing to favorable weather, harvesting In
the eastern counties has advanced rapidly.
\u25a0Wheat cutting is nearly completed even In the
latest localities and threshing is about two
thirds done on the average, ranging from half
finished to nearly all done In places. In Lincoln
and i>ouglas counties the spring wheat yield
appears excellent. In Adams. Spokane and
"Walla Walla counties the winter wheat yield
Is excellent, and In some of the southeast coun
ties there was considerable injury to spring
\u25a0wheat, shortening the yield, but It is'now report
ed that the wheat will grade well, which is con.
trary to earlier reports. In the Horse Heaven
country the yield is light to average. Oats and
barley have made good yields in Spokane.
"Whitman and southeast counties Potatoes in
Â»mÂ« localities will be a good crop and In
others a light one.
The warm, dry weatber ripened hops rapidly
and plcklrg 1* under way in the earliest yards
It will be general by the 13th. The yield Is
cot as large as wa* expected In the Yaklma
. Tards, and in the western yards the yield will
Â»c generally below average, although in a few
yards good. Lice have damaged the crop in
King County.
Rain is now greatly needed to put the soil
to good condition for, fall wheat sowing and
Also for the sugar beet crop.

NEW YORK. Sept. 10. â COTTONâ The cot
ton market was fairly steady and unusually
active for v Saturday. The market did not
respond to the^ weakness | In ' Liverpool and
soon moved up* sharply. Spot houses were
good buyers of October. Exporters say it is
hard to buy cotton in the interior at quoted
prices. Figures show a good absorption of
; cotton by spinners, with -takings \u25a0of about
1G4.000 bales, or about 30,000 bales more
than the same vreek last- year. W'enther ad
vices are somewhat mixed, but indicate no
decided deteriorations.

There was a good Saturday . trade In fresh
fruits, ; but the market was liberally supplied
and remained weak, there - being \u25a0 no \u25a0 particu
larly.brisk demand for anything. The. market
was still badly, congested with Peaches, and.
despite the efforts of dealers to urge business,
there was a ' heavy, surplus at j the close. The
ctnr.ers were taking bulk lots of . Salways at
$20 per ton. Table Grapes were In heavy sup
ply, and weak, over, 2000 packages being re
ceived on the early . express alone. -_ Seedless
wtre relatively weaker than the other descrip.
tiens nnd the best . lots -of \u25a0 that variety were
being- press* d for \u25a0 sale .at 50c : per \u25a0 box In the
afternoon. -Wine Grapes sold well and a small
ad\ ance 'was obtained for hlgM-grade offerings.
Plums, Prunes and Bartlett - Pears ' continued
to command good prices and fancy Apples wero
firmly -held, but the; demand .; for . the latter
was less urgent than previously. Green Apples
and i low-grade * eating) kinds \u25a0 were very dull.
Figs and Quinces were s plentiful and \u25a0 weak.
Melons moved : off well, but supplies were. well

was the arrival of .the .first 'Cranberries :of

Billy Xolan Claims Corbett
Knew That Check He Gave
Did Not Call for Money
Detective Phil O'XolH of Sacranicnto
Brrived fn (own last night and quickly
l:ui:i<-u up Hilly Xolan, Battling- Xel-
ttm'< mnnacrr. Tocetber the pair !
*\u25a0 *>rullrd aloiiK the liiir, and A'olan I
j.oiiitrtf out the various prise-fisht pro
moters and ntneasrerat to the sleuth
In. in Ihe Cupital City. OWelll baa been
Â»iti <luÂ«ili brre by the Sacramento
Crnnd Jury l<Â» InveKtlgrate the alleged
*-<n-i -;i]:ii<su fiiiui um'il to defeat the Hitl
â¢ itn. jiri/.0-tis.ht bill. Aa .Volan has
\u25a0bunn bIM Â«villlngues>t to tell all lie
known about the affair, O'.Veill will
â¢tlt-k with hint and tlnd out everj-thingr.
X'exultH are looked' for 10-ilay when
O'At'ill has a line ou which to worli.
The tirumotcrN and fisht managen do
not aeeiu to be worried over the affair.
The scandal that has arisen. over the
controversy between Harry Corbett and
I?il!y Nolan is stil! at its height. The
promoters of the boxing game have ap
parently decided that too much has been
eai<J regarding the Ralston bill and
other matters, so the noise along the
lim- has ceased to a certain extent.
Buttling Nelson has evidently come
to the conclusion that the best thing he
can do is to stick with his manager,
Uilly Xula.n. It was known to the
UiVlie's lrier.ds that he was- anxious for
to cut up the receipts of the big
light in a hurry. .Last night the Battler
said he was satisfied with the condi
tion of affairs and would let the matter
run along without making any more de
mands.
According to Kelson. Nolan has done
the right thing by him. and he will not
make any fuss about the fight money
tii! he is sure tliat everything is .not as
right as it should be. The Dane and his
Jj?inanagÂ«r will linger but one more day
in S.ir. Francisco before they take. their
departure with the road show. They
â¢will not hesitate here unless the Grand
Jury happens to subpena them to tell
what thoy know about the corruption
fund. Then the getaway may possibly
be delayed.
Noian says there is nothing wrong
Rbout the check he gave Harry Corbett.
According- to his statement, he drew
down the J3OO and told Corbett he
aroold sjive him a check. Corbett. ac
cording to Nolan, was not at all wor
ried and handed Nolan his own check-
Look. The Dune's manager says he
th<-n wrote out the slip.
Xolan says Corbett knew he did not
have an account with the Western Xa
tlor.al Bank, on which the check was
drawn, and that the transaction was a
mere matter otform. Corbett, however,
says Nolan had the check In his pocket
end that it was cashed by Corbett as a
legitimate piece of paper. He did not
discover its worthlessness until he made
en attempt to cash it at the bank.
"I do not intend to prosecute Xolan,"
paid Harry Corbett last night. "I will
be out the ?500. but I will let it go at
that. It's all a mean business and will
do the game no good. "What I have said
etill goes, .md that Is all. I do not in
tend to get into any more arguments
over the affair. Xolan did- me on that
check, no matter what he says. The
check Itself Is evidence enough of that."
\olÂ»nn on the Eastern Stagrc
NEW YORK, Sept. 16. â Battling Nel
son is coming East to disport himself
on the stage and gather a harvest of
dollars. One would think that, having
won the championship by such Infinite'
labor and pain. Kelson would take some
care of it, try to hold on to it. if not for
the sake of the honor, at least for some
cf the money that can be made by fight
ing for it, and keeping it. But, no. sir,
it is the stage for his. Nothing else
will do. He cannot have both. Just as
sure os he begins prancing behind tho
footlights Nelson will get licked. But
he must do it. It is inevitable.

Before the smiling countenance of
Mr. Schmidt had become acclimated at
I Recreation Park yesterday afternoon
the Seals managed to clout every ben
der on the nose and dispatch it to some
part of the lot where fielders lingered
not. For flve Innings the task was so
agreeable that eight runners amused
themselves by skipping lightly over the j
paths and the game was in before the
finish was anywhere near in sight.
The only thing that made the game
worth viewing was the rally which
Oakland made in the sixth. On a com
bination of misplays' and a base on
balls a full house resulted after two
had been mowed down. Kruger pro
duced a -single. Dunleavy swung
through- with a double against the
right field fence and the fans began to
yell, as Oakland had annexed four runs.
There was still a chance for the rally
to continue, but it was not Moski
man's batting day and the best he had
was a pop fly, which blighted the hopes
of the Oakland rooters. The score:

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 16.â Inability

Portland to-day by the score of 4 to 0.
Gray was wild but effective when' men
were on bases, allowing but five scat

fielding feat of the game by pulling
down a line drive with one hand that

AWartor Pimple

When a wart,* mole or jnnple shows
any sign of tenderness it is a warning
that bad blood is behind it Often these
places are on the face, hands, legs or
other part of the body for years, andgive j
no sign to cause uneasiness, and then'
with a little rough handling, a slight cut
or bruise will develop into a sore that re-
fuses to heal, and the sufferer finds him?
self afflicted with a cancerous ulcjer.

but increased when the sore began to
Inflame and discharge matter. At time*
tho place would scab over and appear to
be getting well, but the scab would drop
off, leaving 1 a red, angry looking ulcer. I
had almost despaired of ever curing it,
when my attention was called to S.S. 3.,
and after taking a few bottles the sors

discharge stopped and I was cured. Â» ,-

SPEED IS WHAT
HE NOW WANTS
President Boosevelt Urges
Necessity for Eapid Com
]>letion of Panama Canal
ADDRESSES ENGINEERS
Chief Executive Declares
Himself in Favor of Build
ing on Sea Level Plan
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.â President
Rooeevelt is urging in the strongest terms
the necessity for a plan for the construc
tion of the Panama canal which may be
'accomplished In the shortest possible
time. In his recent remarks to the con
sulting board of engineers of the Isthmian'
Canal Commission he Â£&ld many things
which are regarded as of the utmost im
portance in that connection. These re
marks have been transcribed and trans-'
mitted to the board here, and General'
Davis, its chairman, has been authorized
to make them public.
The President said!
"What 1 am about to say must be con
sidered in the light of suggestion, not as
direction. I have named you because in
my judgment you are especially fitted to
serve as advisers in planning the greatest
engineering work the world has yet seen,
and I expect you to advise me, not what
you think I want to hear, but what you
think I ought to hear."
SEA LEVEL THE BEST.
. "There are two or three considerations
which I trust you will steadily keep be
fore your mind in coming to a conclusion
as to the proper type of canal. I hope
lhat ultimately it will prove possible to
build a sea level canal. Such a canal
would undoubtedly be best in the end, it
feasible, and I. feel that one of the chief
advantages of the Panama route Is that
Ultimately a sea level canal will be a pos
sibility. But . while paying due heed to
the ideal perfectibility of the scheme from
an engineer's standpoint, remember the
need of having a plan which shall provide
for the Immediate building of a canal on
the safest terms and in the shortest pos
sible time. If to build a sea level canal
Trill but slightly increase the risk, then,
of course, it is preferable, but if -to adopt
a plan of a sea level canal means to in
cur hazard and to insure indefinite delay,
then It is not preferable. If the advan
tages and disadvantages are closely bal
anced I expect you to say so. I desire
also to know whether, if you recommend
a high-level, multi-lock canal. It will be
possible after it is completed to turn it
Into or to substitute for It, In time, a sea
level canal without interupting the traffic
upon It. Two of the prime considerations
to be kept steadily in mind are:
SPEED OF CONSTRUCTION.
"Oneâ The utmost practicable speed of
construction.
"Secondâ Practical certainly that- the
plan proposed will be feasibleâ that It can
be carried out with the minimum risk.
"The quantity of work and the amount
of work should be minimized as far as
possible.
"There may be good reason why the de
lay incident to the adoption of a plan for
an ideal canal should be Incurred, but if
there is not then I hope to see the canal
constructed on a system which will bring
to the nearest possible date in the future
the time whea It is practicable to take the
first ship across the isthmusâ that is,
which will In the shortest time possible
secure a Panama waterway between the
oceans of such a character as to* guar
antee permanent and ample communica
tion for the greatest chip of our navy
and for the largest steamers on either the
Atlantic cr the Pacific. The delay in
transit of the veÂ£selsÂ»owlng to additional
locks would be of small consequence when
compared with shortening the time for
the construction of the canal or diminish
ing the risks In its construction.
"In short, I desire your best judgment
on all the various questions to be consid
ered in choosing among the various plans
for a comparatively high-level, multi-lock
canal for a lower level, fewer locks and
for a eea-level canal. Finally. I urge upon
you the necessity of as great expedition
In coming to a decision as is compatible
â¢with thoroughness In considering the con
ditions." â¢' \u25a0 ' \u25a0
BOMB EXPLODED IN
FRONT OF HIS SHOP
Brooklyn Barber Refuses to
- Comply With Blackmail
; ers Demand for $600.
NEW YORK. Sept. 16.â A bomb was
thrown . against the front of the Casino.
P, Liiotta's barber shop, in Flushing ave
nue, Brooklyn, to-day. The explosion
blew in the front doors and windows and
tore up a portion of the floor. L>iotta had
received many threatening letters within
a year, and within a week the writer ot
one had informed him that he would be
killed if he did not at once put $600 where
It could be found by the writer.
.When the bomb exploded three' families.
Including that of Llotta, who lived in the
building, fled. from It In a panic. Liotta
opened fire on a policeman who came run
ning to find the cause of the explosion,
but the bullets went wild.
It is believed the bomb was thrown
from the platform of a passing street car.
DEPLORES ABOLITION
OF THE ARMY CANTEEN
Brigadier General Frederick D. Grant
Makes Many Suffffestlons In tils
Annual Report. '
WASHINGTON. Sept. 16.â 1n his an
nual report Brigadier General Fred
erick D. Grant, commanding the De
partment of the East, makes the sug
gestion that the families of some of the
officers and enlisted men In the army
transferred to the Philippines be al
lowed to live in the barracks and quar-"
ters in-a limited number of abandoned
forts while the husbands are absent
from the country. He suggests Fort
Trunibull, Conn., as an excellent place
for such use.
Speaking of the many trials by court
martial General Grant says that fully
76 per cent of these trials were due to
the use of bad Hcuor in dens of vice
near military posts. Says the General:
"It Is* distressing that the prosperity
of the vile resorts Is due to the activity
of good and worthy, though misguided,
.citizens who have succeeded In abolish
ing the canteen of the army."
