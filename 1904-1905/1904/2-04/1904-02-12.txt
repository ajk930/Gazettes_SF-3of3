THREE JAPANESE TORPEDO BOATS SUNK WITH HEAVY LOSS
OF LIFE IN ATTACK ON RUSSIAN FLEET AT PORT ARTHUR
JAPANESE FLEET IS SAID TO HAVE RENEWED BOMBARDMENT
LONDON, Feb. 12. â In a dispatch from Shanghai dated February 12 a correspondent of the Daily Telegraph says: "The bom
bardment of Port Arthur continues. Three Russian cruisers have been sunk. The Russian-bank building has been destroyed. There
have been disturbances at Port Arthur in which a number of Japanese civilians, were killed or imprisoned. A Chinese mob has de
stroyed the telegraph line-around Newchwang."

CHEFU, Feb. 11. â Out of the four Japanese tor
pedo-boats which made the first attack on Monday night
at Port Arthur three were sunk,, with great loss of life.
The fourth was a 28-knot boat and escaped. The Japanese
torpedo-boats effected an entrance to the outer harbor by
using Russian signal flashlights. Consequently the Rus
sians did not fire upon them.
I have heard the following account of the first sur
prise from a Russian naval officer: The battleship Pallada
was on the outside edge of the Russian fleet and r on duty
lhat night. The chief artillery officer noticed four tor
pedo-boats approaching with full lights and in all respects
jike Russian torpedo-boats. The officer informed his cap
tain that the approaching boats, were Japanese. The cap
tain denied this and said they were built, in Port Arthur,
The artillery officer insisted that they were, Japanese and
the captain became angry, saving:
"I am in command of the ship, sir."

Tokio Welcomes Plan to

of China.
Not All of the Nations
Are Ready to Make
Prompt Reply.
' WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.â The move
â¢made by Decretory r Hay in connection
with the proposed neutralization of
China has aroused the greatest interest
in. diplomatic circles here, , and in con
t-equencr, this being the regular weekly
diplomatic day, many more than the
us tit I number of Kmbassadors and
Ministers called at the State Depart
'snent. It is understood that while, as a
matter of courtesy, the representatives
J;ere of the powers signatory â  to the
i'eking treaty were informed by the
Secretary of the nature of his proposal,
ytt this was only for their information.
"The Secretary ts negotiating directly
with the European Foreign Offices on
this subject through the reEident Amer
ican Emtassadois and Ministers.
â¢ It was said to-day that sum.', but not
all. of the countries addressed had re
i-Sied. and that these replies were gen
erally favorable and satisfactory. As
tome doubt- was expressed in certain
*4uart?rs as to whether Japan would
consent to be. bound in the manner
Iiroposed. it can be eaid that such in
formation as the State'Department has
on the subject Is to the effect that
Japan would welcome an international
agreement neutralizing China.
An intimation has been thrown out
that one reason for this apparent sacri
fice by Japan of the prospective fruits
of victory, if she succeed in her cam
raign. is a fear that some of the great
neutral powers may grow covetous of
more Chinese soil and seize the oppor
tunity when the belligerents are ex
hausted to extend their Chinese hold
ings.
One of the incidents of diplomatic
day, which was witnessed with interest
in the neighborhood of the diplomatic
room of the State Department, was the
meeting of the Japanese Minister and
the Russian Km'oassador. Count Cas
rini was chatting with the Russian
< - har?e; Takahira was alone. The Rus-
Fian bowed with marked politeness and
formality when he perceived the Min
isterâ not once, but twice; and the
Japanese returned the bow in like man
rer. Wirhout speaking, they parted.
R^sardinc the criticism of Baron
Hayashi <>n Secretary Hay's note to the
powers, it can be stated that the word
â¢ 'Manchuria" is not used in the note,
rior has thÂ» State Department author
ized any interpretation of the note so
as to specifically include that province,
though the State Department will not
be led into a discussion of details at
t.iis stage of the negotiations. By a
fcigh official it was said to-night, that
the powers agreed to pres?rve the in
teprity of China in 1900 and that it was
not specified how much of China was in
cluded in the general term. Secretary
Hay's note merely follows the lines of
the principle then enunciated.
RUSSIA WILL REFER
AMERICAN NOTE TO
ADMIRAL ALEXIEFF
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 11.âSecre
tary Hay's note to the powers has at
ti acted much attention in diplomatic
circles here. Any movement having
for its purpose the limiting of the
scene of hostilities Ms received with
sympathy, but in certain quarters the
practicability of the action suggested
is questioned. A prominent diplomat
expressed surprise to-day that the pres
ervation of Korea was not included in
the rote.
The wishes of the United States have
bttn communicated to the Russian
Oovernment and presumably also to
Japan. At the Foreign Office the press
learned this afternoon that no responses
had been made and it wes considered
extremely doubtful whether Russia felt
herself in a position tn make any dec
larations now, as these might hamper
her military operations. The question
â wast said to bÂ«? one for th" military
authorities to decide and the repre
sentations of the United States, which
are understood to be couched in the
most courteous terms, probably will be
referred to Viceroy Alexieff.
Newspapers her* do not fully under
stand the purport of the note and re
gard it as an attempt at mediation,
the bare ruggestion of which, while the
country is smarting under the sting of
defeat, creates irritation.
The VednxnoKti points out that the
United States should have initiated a
Joint action a fortnight ago to restrain
Japan and that it is now too late.
Furthermore, Russia, after her experi
ence at Berlin, has had enough of in
ternational congresses.

Hay's note is considered here to be im
portant:
"Proposing joint representations to
Russia and Japan to prevail upon them
to circumscribe the war operations as
far as possible with a view to prevent
ing disorders in China which might
threaten international trade and to the
preserving of the integrity of China."
The prompt declaration of the neu
tiality of the United States, although
ei pected as a matter of course, lias
niadÂ° a good Impression here. The bit
terness against Great 'Britain, already
great during the negotiations between
Russia and Japan, Is assuming most
alarming proportions. The supposition
that Great Britain evacuated Weihai
wei to 'give Japan a base has called out
the deepest indignation, which has been

RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT
WILL FORM A THIRD
SIBERIAN ARMY CORPS
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 11.â The
Minister of Finance has issued a cpm
municatlon which warns the people
against becoming panic stricken and
sacrificing the securities they hold, as
thereby they will benefit only the spec
ulators. The Ministry exhorts the peo
ple to remain icaUn and collected re
garding the events In the Far East,
which, while they may create tempo
rary difficulties, cannot shake Russia's
economic power. It points out 'that
stocks fell at the outbreak of the
Russo-Turkish war, In 1877, but that
within a fortnight quotations recov
ered. This experience, it says, is now
being repeated.
The note of the Finjfnee Ministry
had a good effect. On the Bourse 1 Rus
sian bonds recovered 2 per cent and
rentes and other securities improved.
Orders have been Issued for the form
ation of a _third Siberian army corps
and a trans-Baikal division of Cos
sacks. These will be incorporated in
the Manchurian army.
Rigid censorship still prevented the
newspapers this afternoon from receiv
ing war news from either Russian 'or
foreign sources. No news has been
received since Viceroy Alexleff's dis
patch* and the public consequently is
still completely in the dark. All man
ner of rumors are afloat. The Govern
ment, however, has taken measures to
counteract their publication, forbid
ding the retailsale of the principal of
fender, the St. Petersburg Gazette.
The Government expresses great dis
pleasure at the publication of the re
port of a Russian victory and the rais
ing of false hopes among the peoble.
Nevertheless the rumors circulated
verbally are\greedlly swallowed. Ac
cording to one report here the Russian
armored cruiser Gromoboi recently
sailed out of Vladivostok, destroyed
twenty Japanese transports off South
ern Korea and was herself sunk by the
Japanese cruisers. Another story
claimed that four of the Vladivostok
warships, under Admiral Stackelbers,
had sunk four Japanese transports.
The most circumstantial story cur
rent In St. Petersburg is a report of the
sinking of the Russian cruiser Variag.
off Chemulpo.
Still another is to the effect that the
recent Japanese attack on Port Arthur
was a feint to protect the passage of
transports bound to Shanhaikwan to
land Japanese troops there and effect
a conjunction with the forces of^ Yuan

The report circulated here that the

"In allowing Japan to use the harbor

German naval experts regard Japan
as having already proved its superior
ity over Russia at sea. Count von
Reventlow said:
'The final issue must be decided on
land. Therefore the main object of
the Russian fleet should be to prevent
the transportation of Japanese troops.
That the Russians permitted them
selves to be attacked unawares at
Port Arthur shows that their strategy
is second rate and their watch ser
vice inefficient; in other words, they
are fatally unready for action. If the
Japanese continue to disable Russian
battleships their command of the sit
uation will be absolute, enabling them
to land troops at will."

"WASHINGTON, Feb. 11. â Senator
Kanna's condition Is very serious, if
not precarious." His physicians realize
this and are watching the case with
the greatest concern. The Senator is
much weaker to-day and as a result
his pulse ran up at 6 o'clock to 104
pulsations to the. minute.
The increased weakness is the direct
result of the fever, as the official bul
letins show there are no complications.
The physicians hope that the fever has
reached its worse stage, but â¢whether
or not it has, they declare they are
unable to say. They are' simply wait
ing for developments aad realize that
the patient has lost ground during the
last two days. Stimulants have been
jriven during the day and with a bene
ficial result.
The Senator rested well during the
past twenty-four hours. This latter
feature of the case is encouraging to
the physicians. Extraordinary pre
cautions are being taken to insure
c;uiet In and around the hotel, so that
the Senator may get all the natural
Fleep possible. The motormen of the
street cars a block away have been re
quested not to ring their gongs, as the
pudden clanging seemed to irritate the
Senator.
After the evening visit of the phy
sicians the Senator slept for about an
hour and a half, which refreshed him.
Dr. Carter remains at the hotel all the
time so as to be on hand in case there
Is a call for him.
The folowing bulletin on Senator
Hanna's condition was Issued to-night:
"At S p. m. Senator Hanna was rest
ing quietly. His temperature when
taken at 4 o'clock was 102 2-10: pulse.
104: respiration. 28. There has been

Three thousand laborers reported to

were diveded into squads and marched
Into the burned district. Accompany
ing the workmen were hundreds of
carts and trucks. 'By 9 cTdock this
force was busily at work in the debris
piling the bricks and broken timbers
on the sidewalks, where theywere then
loaded Into carts to be hauled away.
Besides this force, 700 railroad work
men under the supervision of contract
ing engineers of the Pennsylvania and
Baltimore and Ohio railroads began to
take down the pillars and girders left
standing around the ruins, which in
their present position constitute an ele

WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.â The jfouse
to-day by a vote of 172 to 103 concurred
in the Senate amendment to the ur

The proposition was strongly opposed
in the debate, which covered portions
of three days. There were arrayed
against it some of the House leaders.
Among those voiced their opposi

Hemenway of Indiana, chairman of
the Appropriations Committee, opened
the debate with a strong appeal in
favor of the loan. There was no party

Storm In the Senate Over Pressure
From the White House.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.â The Sen
ate was in executive session more than
four hours. Senator Teller in a speech
lasting more than two hours and
filled with incidents where he alleged
the President had encroached on the
Senate in regard to the making of
Federal appointments, aroused a
number of Republican leaders to the
defense of President Roosevelt. Some
of the Republicans agreed with Sena
tor Teller that there have been many
encroachments from the White House
on the rights of the Senate. The po.
litical phases of the debate were
finally eliminated, with the result that
several ' administrations -were dis
cussed and brought under the ban of
disapproval.
The first was the Cleveland admin
istration, in which it was said that the
President used undue- influence for the
repeal of the purchasing clause, of
the Sherman .act. McKInley's"" in

Senate for the ratification of the Paris
treaty and President Roosevelt's pres

of the Cuban treaty and also the in
fluence he has brought to bear' look

canal treaty were cited as instances in
which the Senate has not been left
free to deal with these topics accord

cism was not alone of the 'executive,
several Senators, including Spooner.

CONFESSE S
THE CRIME
Walter McGuire, Who Was Held
on Suspicion, Pleads Guilty
to Having Stolen Safe From
a Gar Near San Luis Obispo
GOES TO. PRISON -.
FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
Breaks Down When He Learns
That Former Trusty, in
Whom He Confided, Is Caught
While Digging Up the Money
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Feb. 11.â "Walter
McGuire,' alias Fred A. McGuire, alias
, Walter* Clark, who was bound over to
the Superior Court January 26 under
the name of "John Doe" for the al
leged robbery on January 21, 1904, of
a- Wells-Fargo Company safe from an
express car near this city, pleaded
this afternoon to burglary in
"the first degree and received a sen
tence of fourteen years' imprisonment
at hard labor in Folsom prison. Mc-
Gulre's confession was cleverly
brought about by the aid of a trusty
in the County Jail, J. W. Riordan, who
gained the confidence of the thief, and
was told where the stolen treasure was
buried. Wednesday night Riordan went
to dig it up and the officers were on
hand. The stolen money consisted of
$385 In" gold, $332 in currency and $40 63
in silver, a total of $757 68. A $300 dia
mond was .also found. The sack con
taining the *noney was buried in a
ravine a mile and a quarter noTth of
town. When Sheriff Ivens confronted
McGuire with the facts of the finding
of the money the prisoner confessed
and expressed a wish to plead guilty
and have the matter over.
McGuire stated in an interview to
day that he bought a ticket for San
Luis Obispo from Santa Barbara and
came ud on the second- section
of No.* 9 as a passenger. He noticed
while in Santa Barbara, that the bar
usually thrown across the front door
of the express. car as an extra precau
tion was not* in place and that one
man had charge of both cars.
Upon reaching San Luis Obispo
McGuire went to the end. of the car
next to the engine and climbed Into
the vestibule from beneath, after "pro
viding himself with a jackscrew from
the engine. When Express Agent Sul
livan went into the other car McGuire
easily battered in the door and en
tered. Once inside he rolled the little
safe over to the side door, opened it
and, watching his chance between
tunnels, dumped the safe out and
jumped after it.
McGuire stated that he then search
ed in the tunnel for something to open
the safe, but could not find anything.
I He went through the tunnel ' and
down to Cuesta, where he broke open
the section men's time box and pro
cured a hatchet. Going back, he took
the light from the entrance to the
tunnel and with it discovered a fish
plate. With the fishplate and hatchet
he battered open the safe.
The wind was blowing hard and
McGuire. says his hat blew off when
he jumped out after the safe. He.
hunted unsuccessfully for an hour and
a half for his hat. He next told of
buying a hat from a hobo, trying to
hire Farmer Cheney to haul him to
'â  town because he had sprained his an

Will Do for YOU, Every Reader of The Call May Have

It used to be considered that only urinary
and bladder troubles were to be traced to the
kidneys, but now modern science proves that
nearly all diseases have '.heir beginning in
the disorder of these most important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify the blood â
that' is their work.
Therefore, when your kidneys are weak or
out of order, you can understand how quick-
ly your entire body is affected, and how ev-
ery organ seems to fail to do its duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly," begin taking
the great kidney* remedy, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
, Root, because as soon as your kidneys begin
to get better thev will help all the other or-
gan r to health. A trial will convince any one.

Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible
for many kinds of diseases, and if permitted
to continue, much . suffering and fatal results
are sure to follow. Kidney trouble irritates
the nerves, makes you dizzy, restless, sleep-
less and irritable. Makes you pas3 water often
during the day and obliges you to get up
many times during the night. Unhealthy kid-
neys cause rheumatism, gravel, catarrh of the
bladder, pain or dull ache in the back, joints
and muscles; makes your head ache and back
ache, cause indigestion, stomach and liver
trouble, you get a sallow, yellcw complex-
ion, makes you feel as though you had heart
trouble; you may have plenty of ambition, but
no strength;, get weak, and waste away.
The cure for these troubles is Dr. Kilmer's

AMERICAN MINISTER
TO KOREA DESCRIBES
BATTLE OF CHEMULPO
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.â Two ca- I
blegrams were received at the State
Department from Minister Allen, dated
Seoul, both referring to the naval en
gagements off Chemulpo on the 8th
and 9th. In his rirst dispatch the Min
ister reports the arrival of twenty-one
Japanese naval vepsols at Chemulpo on
the afternoon of the 9th. Two. Rus
sian naval vessels, the Variag and the
Korutz. were in Chemulpo harbor and
attempted to prevent the landing of
Japanese forces, but with no success.
The forrign naval vessels, the Minis
ter says, were generally leaving the
harbor. There was a report that the
Japanese naval vessels had captured
tranpports off Mukpho on the 9th. The
second dispatch says: ,
"A running naval engagement took
place at Chemulpo harbor about noon.
Tthe Variag and the Korutz again at
tempted to escape, but failed. The Va
riag was injured. On their return the
Japanese naval vessels announced offi
cially that they would attack the place
at 4 p. m. At the latter hour the Ko
rutz blew up and sank. She was a
slow vessel, which made.lt difficult for
her to escape. The Japanese naval
vessels attacked the Variag from the
outside harbor until she sank. â¢
"Twenty-five hundred Japanese troops
are in Seoul."

TOKIO, Feb. 11.â Further details of
the naval engagement at Chemulpo on
Monday, in which Admiral Urlu's.Jap
anese fleet destroyed the Russian
cruiser Varlng and the gunboat Ko
rutz, show th.at these vessels fought
separate battles and were crushed by
the superior force of the Japanese.
The Russian steamship Susyari also
was destroyed and sunk.
Both warships tried to escap? from
pen before dawn on Monday, but
eventually put back. At 9:30 o'clock
'.hat mc-rnlng the Korutz accepted the
Japanese challenge and alone v/r.nt out
to f.ght the whole fleet. She v.ms com
pletely outmatched. Japanese broad
sidt-s raked her continually until she
st;rik. â  '.
Mnny of her crew were killed \>y
chelta or drowned, and the few who es
copeO to shore were captured. The
Variag, steaming out .to sea, was mei
by a hail of shells. Her mast was
speedily dismantled. The Russians
fought most desperately and retreated
to- the harbor at 2 o'clock in the ufter
noon. One account says her 'emv set
her on fire when they saw she must be
captured or sunk.
Another report has it that the Va
rlag's commander, Captain Vladimir
Behr, ordered his officers and crew to
jump overboard and save themselves
If they could, and then blew up the
ship, sacrificing his own life.
Some few of the crew. were drowned
in the attempt to escape, but the men
loyally aided their officers, not one .or
whom was lost thus, llapv swam not
to the shore, but to foreign men-of-war
in the harbor, which promptly lowered
boats and went to their rescue. These
were the. Italian cruiser Elba, the
French cruiser "Pascal and the English
cruiser Talbot.

JAPANESE ADMIRAL
IS .A 1 GRADUATE OF
ANNAPOLIS ACADEMY
Rear Admiral Sovokichl Uriu was the
â fifth and last Japanese student at the
naval academy at Annapolis to grad
uate. In 1S68 Congress passed a law
to permit the Empire of Japan to send
to Annapolis a limited number of stu
dents to obtain a naval education and
during the succeeding nine years
twelve young subjects of the Mikadu
entered the naval academy on proba
tlpn.
Seven of. these withdrew after terms
of one to three years and five gradu
ated with the first class after a four
years' course.
The brightest of the latter was Ta
suker Serato, or "Tim" Serato. as he
was dubbed by his class, mates. Sevato
and Urlu graduated in June, 1881. Ser
ato standing number fourteen . and
Uriu number twenty-sixMn a class of
seventy-two members. Serato scored
599.47 marks and Uriu 570.45 marks out
of a possible aggregate maximum of
760 for their four years.
Their standing in studies of a nauti
cal character was. good but somewhat
backward in such as public law,
French and Spanish, which deficiency
pulled down the final aggregate. Their
conduct, judging from the number of
demerits, was of the average, Serato
having 63 and Uriu 60.
Considering the difficulties under
â which these Japanese students under
took to get a naval education those
who graduated acquitted themselves
remarkably well and gave promise of
becoming efficient officers. The name
of Serato has not yet been mentioned
in - connection with the . late brilliant
naval attack, but if he is still alive he
is likely to distinguish himself as
greatly as his class mate, Sovokichi
Uriu.

LOCAL JAPANESE
TO RAISE FUNDS
FOR FATHERLAND
Free. Trade With the Orient
of Great Importance
to This City.
The' Japanese in the United States
propose to raise $5,000,000 in aid' of their
country during her time of peril. Meet
ings are being held in all portions of
America and much enthusiasm has
been manifested. Yesterday being a
holiday, the twenty-five hundred
and sixty-fourth anniversary of ttie
birth of Jlminu, founder of the Japa
nese empire, was selected as a day par
ticularly fitting to call together tne lit
tle brown men who love their country.
A meeting was held in this city last
night, attended by more, than 200 Japa
nese merchants, and the situation was
fully diBcu-sed. It was the consensus of
opinion that the Pacific Coast States,
which include California, Arizona, Colo
rado, New Mexico and Idaho, should
contribute $500,000.
Consul Uyeno, who presided at the
meeting-, was given charge of the col
lection of funds and the appointment
of such committees as he might deem
necessary. No subscriptions will be so
licited, and those contributing money
will have the privilege of offering their
coin either to the war fund, the family
fund or the Red Cross fund. Money
donated to the war fund will' be for
warded at once to the Government, to
be used' in the equipment of the army.
Funds donated toward the family fund
will be used In alleviating the distress
of those who are unfortunate enough
as to be deprived of their means of
support by the war, while donations to
the Red Cross fund will be used for
the relief of those stricken on the bat
tle field, r no matter under what flag
they may fight.
Local Japanese are sanguine that the
Eastern States of America will raise
their share of the $5,000,000, as they
state that while there may not be many
Japanese in the East, the few are
wealthy: and will contribute liberally.
SAX FRANCISCO'S INTERESTS.
The size of the commercial stake that
San Francisco has in the maintenance
of free communication by sea with Chi
na, Japan and that part of China that
Is, known as Russian China, Korea and
Hongkong is made clear by figures that
were secured at the Custom-house in
this city, yesterday.
- The exports for the calendar year
ending December 31, 1903, to each of the
regions indicated in the foregoing Were
in total as follows: To the Chinese em
pire, $2,363,985; to Russian China, $134,
466; Hongkong, $3,682,798; Japan, $3,980,
697; Asiatic Russia, $114,622; Korea,
$85,153.. The Imports as tabulated in the
Custom-house were as. follows: From
the Chinese empire, j $5,903,095; â  Japan,
$10,182,213. Adding together the exports
and imports shows the total Interest
that San . Francisco alone had in open
transportation last year amounted to
$25,417,024 to and from Ihe places men
tioned. â¢ . . â¢,-..-.
From" the Official figures it appears
that Japan was the largest customer
of all for exports, and. la

turn.- the greatest value of imports to
San Francisco came from Japan. Here
tofore flour has figured as ah export
more than It may in the future, espe
cially into the country that is tribu
tary .to Manchuria.
The exploits of Japan in destroying
the Russian war vessels, by which it
has secured predominating naval force
in the Pacific, makes the chance .bet
ter that shipments between Japan and
the United States will not be Interfered
with as a result of the war. It Is
reported en excellent authority that
a shipment of 5,000,000 pounds of bar
rel' beef for Russia will soon pass
through this city."
Not long ago 1.000,000 pounds of beef
went out through the Golden uate for
Russia. The 5.000,000 pounds to ce-me
are undoubtedly for war uses. The
previous shipments was the regular an
nual supply for Siberia and Saghalien.
to be consumed In Siberia and by the
prisoners and others at Saghalien.
From a recent consular report It was
expected that by the close of the pres
ent vcar there would be at least ten
flouring mills in operation at Harbin,
a new Russian tc-wn in Manchuria that
now has a population of 60.000, but
which two years ago was only a ham

SPEAKS WEIX OF JAPANESE
Lieutenant Charles W. Farr, medical
department. U. S. A., who is now sta
tioned at Fort Mason, has had consid
erable experience in Japan. In speak
ing of the Japanese army he said yes
terday:
"The Japanese are thoroughly well
drilled and equipped. The nation is
very proud of the army and att tender
to it the most loyal support. A fea
ture which strongly impressed me was
the fact that the email boys ranging
from 5 to 10 years of age were in
structed in military training. I went
to several of the large schools in Yo
kohama and I saw these little yunsr
sters going through a precise military
drill, and all carrying little wooden
guns, which they seemed to manipu
late with natural aptitude.
"They all entered into the spirit of
the drilling with great enthusiasm and
it was quite remarkable to see the In
telligence displayed by the little chaps
!n executing the difficult maneuvers."

ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 11. â The
Czar to-day received a telegram from
Viceroy Alexieff. describing the dam
age done to the Russian warships dur
ing the bombardment by the Japanese
fleet at Port Arthur. It says:
"The Cesarewitch and Pallada were
brought Into the harbor on Tuesday.
The Retvizan is making temporary re
pairs to a hole. Repairs to the battle
ships are so complicated that It is dif
ficult to say when the ships will be
ready. The Pallada and Novik will
be docked in turn and I expect them
to be ready in a fortnight. All the
other vesels injured in the fight are
now repairing: and coaling in the har
bor. I expect them to be ready in
three days.
"The wounded officers are doing
well. Four of the wounded have died.
A majority of the wounded belonged
to the cruiser Pallada and their in
juries are due to gases from the ex
plosion of a melinite torpedo. A care
ful search by cruisers and torpedo
boats day and" night has not revealed
the presence of the enemy."
It Is officially announced that nf>
news "has been received here of the
fight at Chemulpo, the landing of Jap
anese or the blowing up of a bridge
on the Manchurian Railroad.
The admiralty has issued specific
orders that no telegrams from the Far
East, whether for private persons,
newspapers or news agencies, will be
transmitted. The admiralty will give
out official reports.
Admiral Strydloff. commander of
the Russian Black Sea fleet, has quiet
ly left for the Far East to take com
mand of the Russian fleet there. All
the unattached naval officials in St.
Petersburg and Kronstadt have been
ordered to go East promptly, without
making farewell calls.
Students In uniform and bareheaded
this afternoon paraded in front of the
Kazan Cathedral and went to the Win
ter Palace. They were followed by
several thousand persons singing the
national anthem.
The Assistant Chief of Police
thanked the students for .their evi
dences of patriotism, but he requested
them to no longer disturb the Czar.
The, crowds then returned, singing.
Serious disturbances are reported to
have broken out at Reval. the fortified
seaport on the Gulf of Finland. Four
companies of soldiers are said to have
been dispatched to suppress the riot
ing. The disturbances are believed to
be connected with labor troubles.
There is a general movement among:
the public to raise money for the pur
pose of increasing the navy.
The Red Cross Society sent the
steamship Mongolia, laden with hos
pital stores, to the Far East on Sun
day.
The question of abandoning Russian
participation in the St. Louis Exposi
tion Is under consideration. The mer
chants of Moscow to-day notified Com
missioner General Alexandrovisky that
ttiey would devote the money intended
for the exposition to the Red Cross So
city and to assisting the war orphans
and widows. They intend to con
tribute $500,000.
If it is decided to abandon the Rus
sian exhibit the Government will fol
low the example of the Moscow mer
chants and appropriate the St. Louis
fund and the remainder of previous
exposition funds, amounting to about
$225,000, to the Red Cross Society.

LONDON*. Feb. 11.â King Edward, at

Special Dispatch to The Call
LONDON, Feb. 12.â The Daily Mail
this morning publishes a dispatch
from Copenhagen stating that the
Russian Baltic Fquadron of fifteen
warships passed yesterday through
Danish waters on its way to the Far
East. As a fierce storm raged in the
North Sea, It was added, the Russian
admiral ordered the squadron through
Kaiser Wilhelm canal. The Daily Mail
editorially refers to this as verging on
a breach of neutrality, if not an ac
tual breach on the r>art of the Ger
man Government, but no confirmation
of the report is forthcoming, except
the Berlin Lokal Anz^iger's statement
that Russia had given notice of a de
sire to pass Fhi;is through Kiel canal.
A British naval officer whom 1 ques
tioned on the subject last night said:
â¢Russia has in the Black Sea a very
fine squadron, but by existing treaties
this fleet cannot pats through the Dar
denelles. In the Baltic fleet, on the
â¢ â¢ther hand, there are at least four bat
tleships, but they are of somewhat ob
scure types. The four battleships could
possibly be made ready in a short time,
ar.d with the Oslabia, now on its way
to the Far East, which could be de
tained, a small squadron of battleships
could be formed. There are no modern
cruisers in the Baltic fleet to accom
pany them. Â£til! th?re are a number
of torpedo craft which might be util
ized as attendants upon such a fleet."
At the Japanese legation to-night no
pi-eat importance was attached to the
report that the Russian Baltic squad
ion is going to the Far East. It was
explained that even were the report
true the fleet would not reach the scene
of operations under sir weeks, by
which time the situation might have
changed materially In any case It was
paid the J a panesÂ© navy would be on
puard to meet the ships. It was also
pointed out at the legation that Great
Britain had declared her neutrality,
and that as nearly all the coaling sta
tions east of Suez are British the Rus
sian men-of-war will experience diffi
culties in coaling and will be hindered
by the necessity of having colliers ac
company them.
PARIS RECEIVES NEWS
OF JAPANESE REPULSE
IN PORT ARTHUR BAY
PARIS, Feb. 11.â The Temps says It
has received confirmation from official
sources of the report from Port Arthur
that the Japanese attempted to make
a landing at the bay of Port Arthur and
were immediately repulsed.
The Journal des Debats in a special
dispatch from St. Petersburg announces
that a bombardment of Port Arthur
occurred the day before yesterday, and
pgain yesterday, and says that the
Japanese fleet withdrew after having
suffered severe losses. To-day, it is add
edj all is quiet off Port Arthur.
The Foreign Office received a dispatch
to-day, dated yesterday, reporting that
f>|>09 Japanese troops are encamped near
Seoul, Korea, some of which have en
tered the town. It is added that quiet
Xo mention is made in the dispatch
of the presence of the Korean Emperor
r.x. the French legation, where he is re
ported to have sought refuge, and there-
J'jre the authorities here place no cre
ii"nce in the report.
Regarding the announcement ttfat
]:ussian sailors from the Variag and
Korutz, sunk by the Japanese off Che
irulpo, have sought refuge on the
French cruiser Pascal, which are con
firmed, the Foreign Office says the
French commander offered them an
asylmn only in the interest of human
ity, that no protest on the subject has
been made by the Japanese Govern
ment and that the refugees will be
f-nt to Russia. They probably will be
T'quired to give their parole not to
Sf rve again during the war.
Advices received here by the Foreign
Office ore to the effect that the damage
f u?tained by the Russian battleship
Cesarevitcb. beached at Port Arthur on
the night of February 8 after having
been torpedoed by the Japanese, is not
serious, and that she will bo able to re
sume active service shortly.
The rutting of the cables compels of
ficial messages from Korea to come
bere by way of St. Petersburg, causing
a delay of twelve hour?, therefore no
official confirmation has been received
of the report that the Emperor of Ko
rea had sought refuge in the French
legation, nor has the Foreign Office
been officially notified that the crews of
the sunken Russian warships Variag
ahd Korutz took refuge on the French
cruiser Pascal after the engagement
with the Japanese off Chemulpo.
Official sentiment here is somewhat
reassured concerning the United States*
note to the powers on the subject of
the neutrality and integrity of China,
United States Embassador Porter
pointing out that the powers have a
common Interest in keeping China neu
tral. Foreign Minister Delcasse evinces
the utmost desire to co-operate with
the United States so long as nothing
irfmleal to Russia is done.
The friendly Fcntiments of the French
Government toward the United States
are indicated by the message of both
President Loubet and Delcasse con
cerning the Baltimore disaster.

TOKIO, Feb. 11. â The following is
in the draft of the imperial rescript

was issued in Japan yesterday:
"We, "by the grace of heaven Em
peror of Japan, seated on the throne
occupied by the same dynasty since

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12. 1904.
THE CALL'S SPECIAL SUMMARY OF THE DAY'S WAR NEWS
The only. Important changes In; the relative positions of the Russian and Japanese forces reported
In the special cablegrams to The Call up to 2 o'clock this morning were that the Russian Vladivostok
squadron had sailed southward, presumably to effect. Impossible, a junction with the Russian fleet nt Port
Arthnr, and that Japanese transports, under cover of warships, had attempted to land troops in the
vicinity of Port Arthur for a, land attack.
Japan continues to pour troops into Koreii. and the advance northward probably has been begun.
Russia U strengthening her forces on Uio.Yalu River, 'Where the first important land battle seems cer
tain to occur. .â¢
ence to our will, so that our relations
with all the powers have been steadily
growing in cordiality. It was thus
entirely against our expectation that
we have unhappily come to open hos
tilities against Russia. The integrity
of Korea is a matter of gravest con
cern to this empire, not only because
of our traditional relations with that
country, but because the separate ex
istence of Korea is essential to the
safety of our realm. Nevertheless,
Russia, in disregard of -her solemn
treaty pledges to China and her re
peated assurances to other powers, is
still in occupation* of Manchuria, has
consolidated and strengthened her
hold on those, provinces and Is bent
upon their final annexation. And,
since the absorption of Manchuria by
Russia would render it Impossible to
maintain the Integrity of China and
would, in addition, compel the aban
donment of all hope of peace in the
Far East, we were determined; in
these circumstances to settle the ques
tion by negotiations and to secure
thereby permanent peace. With that
object in view, our competent author
ities, by our order, . made proposals
to Russia and frequent conferences
were held during the last six nfonths.
"Russia, however, never met such
proposals in a spirit of conciliation,
but by wanton delays put off a settle-
captured seven Russian ships and chased others-" This
probably refers to the Tuesday battle.
In a dispatchfrom Copenhagen a correspondent -of
the Daily Mail says: "The Russian Baltic squadron of fif
teen warships passed through Danish waters to-day'v en
route for the Far East, around Cape Skagen; but a fierce
storm was raging in the North Sea .and, the Russian ad-
ment. of. the six. questions, ostensibly
advocating peace on one hand, while
on the other 1 extending her navy and
military preparations, so as to accom
plish her own' selfish designs.* We
cannot in. the least admit that Russia
had any serious or genuine desire for
peace. .She rejected the proposals of
our Government. â¢ The safety of Ko
rea was in danger and the interests of
our empire were menaced. The
guarantees for the future which we
failed to secure by peaceful negotia
tions can now be obtained only by an
appeal to arms. . â¢ . â  f
: "It is our earnest wish that by the
loyalty and valor of our faithful sub
jects peace may soon be permanently
restored and the glory of our empire
preserved." .

most - conservative commercial houses
in this city, with immense interests
in the Orient, has received a message
in cipher from Its representative in
Chefu that the Japanese have cap
tured Port Arthur and destroyed the
entire Russian tteet. It was stated
that the Japanese army first blew up
the railroad fifty miles from the coast
to cut off relief and~then carried by
assault the promontory overlooking
the city and harbor.
Mounting heavy artillery here, they
shelled- the city --and- harbor, driving
the Russian" fleet into the sea, where
the Japanese battleships -and cruisers
met them.' h\ the resulting fight the
Russian ships were' all either cap
tured or destroyed.
The Japanese then * attacked and
crptured Port Arthur, taking posses
sion of the' immense stores of. coal and
provisions.
It was also reported that the Jap
anese had planned explosions all along
the line of the Siberian railway and
that thus the Czar's army in the Far
East was isolated..
While this startling message is giv

British Foreign Office
Gives Warning Through
the Press.
Would Consider Move
ment of Fleet as Breach
of Treaty.
L'ONDON, Feb. 12.â The question of
tho passage'of the Dardanelles by the
Russian Black Sea fleet has not been
raised at the Foreign Office here, where
the following statement was made to
the press last night:
"Russia has not asked permission for
the passage of warships through tho
Dardanelles. If Russia should attempt
any such thing without asking permis
sion it would constitute a grave breach
of the treaty on the subject."
"Vice Admiral Sir Gerard Henry Noet.
who commands the British Asiatic
squadron In succession to Admiral Sir
Cyprian Bridge, will sail from Mar
seilles to-day for the Far East.
It was said at the Foreign Office here
yesterday afternoon that the assertion
of the Novoe Vremya of St. Petersburg
that the Japanese fleet used "Wei-hai
wel as a base for its attack on Port
Arthur Is absolutely untrue.
Statements of all kinds concerning
the Port Arthur fight are published
here this morning. According to thÂ«
Chefu correspondent of the Daily Mail
the lack of preparation on the part of
the Russians at Port Arthur was due
to the fact that all the naval and mili
tary "officers were attending a circus
performance at Port Arthur, which did
not terminate until early Tuesday
morning.
A correspondent of the Standard at
Tokio sends In this morning an en
tirely new account of the Port Arthur
encounter. He says Admiral Togo's
fleet arrived on Monday night and
found the Russian squadron drawn up
In battle formation outside the harbor
and under "the shadow of the forta, thÂ»
destroyers being spread out over a dis
tance of five miles. Admiral Togo de
cided on a rjght attack and opened
fire at 11 o'clock. While the cannon
ading was going on a number of Jap
anese boats crept to the foot of tfie
cliff and succeeded In getting in be
tween the Russian ships and the land.
Here they lay unnoticed until the Rus
sians began to give way before the
Japanese fire and sought to re-enter
the harbor. Thfe torpedo boats then
opened fire at comparatively close
range and sank two battleships and
one cruiser close to the entrance to
the harbor. The effect of this coup
was the retreat of the remainder of
the squadron into the harbor. All was
safe on board the Japanese ships at
i noon on Tuesday. The correspondent
concludes that the engagement was
then still In progress.
In a dispatch from Toklo a corre
spondent of the Times comments upon
the grim determination of the Japanese
people, as evinced by the expeditious
and absolutely undemonstrative man
ner in which the mobilization of troops
has everywhere been carried out. The
correspondent Is of the opinion that
Major General Baron Kodanra will be
In command of the Japanese land ope
rations.

objections. . .
Miss Hennessy" is one of four sisters
reared in Grass Valley and all of them
teachers in the public schools of Ne
vada County. Objections were made to
the courtship of the fairest daughter of
the family by the young Sacramentan.
So the pair decided to elope. The brido
received some assistance from one of
her sisters and this morning the couple
boarded an early train and got off at

They proceeded at once to the mar
riage license clerk and then to the
priest. They will spend some days in

CUTS SPRAYING
COST ONE HALF
Warren T. Clarke of Uni
vcrsitv of California Saves
State Prune Growers Money
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street. Feb. 11.
Where the former cost of spraying
prune trees to rid them of the San Jose
scale was four cents a tree, it is now
only two cents a tree: This 50 per cent
reduction has been secured by Warren
T. Clarke of the University of Califor
nia after . a campaign in the prune
growing district of Kings County,
whence he has just returned. It means
an immense saving to the growers of
California and they have good reason
to rejoice over it.
Mr. Clarke, who is superintendent ot
agricultural extension, accomplished
the reduction by inventing a cheaper
means for securing a spray of the
proper consistency. The ingredients of
the spray consist of lime, sulphur, salt
and water, which under the oldLmethod
must be boiled for two hours. Now Mr.
Clarke has achieved the same results
by treating the ingredients with chemi
cals. The nature of these chemicals
Mr. Claeke will not divulge. He desires
to wait until the success of the new.
process is proved.
"It used to cost the orchardlsts two
cents a gallon for the spray," said Mr.
Clarke to-day. "As It takes two gal
lons to spray a tree that is four cents
a tree. If there are 100 trees in an
acre that means a cost Of $1 an acre.
If a man had 500 acres, say, it would
cost him $2000 to spray his orchard
every year. Under this new process
the cost Is cuMn half.'
'"Another advantage is that the work
is more thoroughly done. The orchard
laborers are likely to get careless when
they have to do a thing dVer and over
again and eo do it in a slipshod way.
If they have to boil a thing for two
hours they are apt to think an hour Is
enough, which, of course, destroys the
efficiency of the spray."
While in Kings County Mr. Clarke
treated some 1246 acres of prune trees.

WANTS TO KEEP
MASSIE BABY
Foster Father Says That for
Nine Years He Has Cared
Lovingly for His Charge
J)EXIES STORY OF CRUELTY
Bov Kisses the Mother Who
Deserted Him, but Says^He
Does Xot Remember Her
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Feb. 11.
Bereft of his father, who was killed
by a btHlet, and deserted by his moth
er while yet in his baby clothes. Wil
liam Massie. a bright lad of 9 years, is
the center of a legal struggle, in which
the Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children Is ranged on one side
and John A. Massie, the boy's cousin,
and his wife on the other. Report is
that Massie has been cruel and the so
ciety has taken action.
The case first came up last Saturday,
when John Massie appeared in court to
answer to a summons and stated that
the child was on a ranch some dis
tance from Portland, Or. Yesterday
morning Mrs. Massie and the lad v.ere
located by the Sheriff's office "at An
tioch, in Contra Costa County, and the
lad was seized there by a deputy sheriff
as he and Mrs. Massie were about to
take the train. The boy was brought,
into court in the afternoon" and Judge
Hall made an order that he be taken
out of the possession of the Massies
and placed in charge of Miss C. Anita
Whitney for safe keeping.
This morning Massie and his wife and
the boy's mother appeared in court,
represented by an attorney, and asked
that the child be given, back to them
pending the hearing of the case next
Saturday. They finally gained their
point, as Attorney W. H. O'Brien prom
ised the court that they would produce
the child at that time. Judge Hall inti
mated that he had been purposely mis
led and said:
"Mr. O'Brien, last Saturday I was
told that this child was in Oregon and
out of the jurisdiction of this court. It
was found yesterday in the next coun
ty, where 1 firmly believe it has been
all the time. I do not propose to take
any chances that this lad will not be
present at the hearing of the case."
It was, however, represented to Judge
Hall that the child was homesick, and
at his ; own request, coupled with the
guarantee of the attorney, the Judge
revoked his order of j-esterday and al
lowed the child to return to the home of
his foster-parents, who live at 1013
Linden street, Oakland.
In the background there is a rumor
that a mysterious rich uncle and aunt
of the boy would like to get him. and
it is to their door that Massie lays the
charges that have been made against
him. He now says he will adopt the
boy as soon as he gets out of his trou
ble with the society, and to this end
has found the lad's mother,' who he
says will aid him in his fight for the
child. She was in court this morning,
and though the boy kissed her when
told to do so, he knows little about her.
and looks upon Massie and his wife as
his- parents.
Though Mrs. John Massie was found
to be in Antioch with the child, she de
clares that she has been in Portland,
and that while she was there her hus
band was called upon to surrender the
child to the Oakland society. Mrs. Mas
sie admits, however, that she was only
in Portland one day and that she had
not informed her, husband of her plans.
The boy's father was killed by a bul
let fired from a revolver in the hands
of his mother. In a dying statement
made by the wounded man he exon
erated her from all blame and said that
the shooting was accidental. The baby
was hardly a year old when It was
taken by the boy's cousin, who has had
It for the last nine years.
Massie's friends declare that he idol
izes the child and has given the boy
the" best of care for years.

YOUNG MEMBER
Business Methods of Charles
J. Haars Are Investigated by
Kev. A. C. Bane and a Jury
METHODISTS' FIRM STAND
Condemns Real Estate Man to
Banishment From Church and
Defendant Will Now Appeal
A unique trial ha? been proceeding
Â»t the Howard -street Methodist
Church, in which the business meth-
Bds of Charles J. Haars, a real estate
tg?nt and yo'^n? member of the
rhurch, have been under investigation.
The Rev. Mr. Bane, the pastor, and
Â«â  jury of members of the church have
listened to the charges, which were:
First, that Haars obtained a loan from
A. H. Junod cf 51000 by false pretenses
tnd representation in connection with
a mortgage on certain property located
at T57 Howard street; and second, that
be had been jruilty of falsehood in the
transaction with Jurod.
The charges, which were made by
Arnold Nelson, a member of the church,
began on Thursday night, February 7,
and the case did not terminate until
iast night, when the Jury brought In
a verdict of guilty on both charges.
There had been a mass of evidence
produced by John Ralph Wilson, who
appeared as prosecuting attorney, and
records from the County Recorder's of
fice were put in evidence to prove the
case against Haars, and fully a dozen
Witnesses were called.
After the jury had brought In Its
verdict the Rev. Mr. Bane pronounced
Judgment, expelling Haars from the
Methodist church. Haars gave notice
of appeal to the quarterly conference.
BAY THEY FIXD DEFECT
IX A VOTING MACHINE
Frank C. Jordan Meets a Perplexing
Problem Before the Ixw Angeles
Board of Supervisors.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 11.â "Whether
or not it will be possible for a dis
honest voter to beat the voting ma
chines which are Intended mechanic
ally to prevent fraud and insure honest
elections Is now a mooted question,
because of a seeming defect which has
bfÂ»en pointed out to the Board of Su
pervisors by Walter F. X. Parker, for
.mer expert of the State's Board of
Examiners and now the political rep
resentative of the Southern Pacific
Ilailroad in thi? city. Frank Jordan,
clerk of the Supreme Court, is here
trying to induce this county to pur
chase the Standard voting machines,
one of the two which the State com
mission has approved. He appeared
before the Board of Supervisors and in
the presence of a number of politi
cians and offiicals was extolling .the
virtues of his machine, when Parker
interposed a question which may re
suit in Los Angeles Cqunty not in
restins In machines for the present.
Parker's point is that any voter may
vote for any piven enndidate and then
vote a second time for the same can
didate by simply writing the name of
s:.< h candidate in the blank space pro
\ided for registering votes for any per
f=on whom a voter may desire to vote
â for. It was admitted that the ma
chines do not cover this point com
pletely and the Supervisors have de
ferred the purchase of machines pend-
Its a legal opinion on the matter.
Senator Leavitt's machine was not rep
resented.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
?L\KE PEACE WITH
YOUR STOMACH
Yon Art? Certain to Ix>se If You At-
tempt the Use of Force and
Violence.
You cannot force your stomach to do
rrork that It is unable and unwilling
to do. It has been tried time and time
again with always the same result.
The stomach is a good and faithful
servant, but when pushed beyond the
limit it rebels. Some stomachs win
stand much more abuse than others,
but every stomach has Its limit, and
v.-hen that limit Is reached It is a very
dangerous and unwise proceeding to
attempt to force it Into doing further
â work. The sensible and reasonable
course Ik to employ a substitute to
carry on the work of digestion and give
the stomach an opportunity to recu-
perate and regain its lost strength.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
only perfect substitute to take up and
carry on the work of tired, worn out
Etomachs. They are natural and eaey
in their work and cause no disturb-
ance in the digestive organs. They con-
tain all of the essential elements that
rr.ake up the gastric juice and other
dipestSve fluids and will digest any
food thai/ a strong, healthy stomach
.â will, and do it in the same time and
in the same way. They work indepen-
dently of surrounding conditions and
the fact that the stomach is weak or
diseased docs not influence them at all
in their useful and effective work.
They will digest food just as well in
a Siass jar or bottle as they will In a
rtomach. You can see that for your-
self by putting one of them into a jar
with a square m^-al and some water to
enable it to work.
Stuarts Dyspspsla Tablets, by thus
relieving th? stomach of its work, en-
able that orsan to rezi and recuperate
and regain its health and strength.
The process is perfectly natural and
plain. Nature will heel the stomach
juft as fchc heals a wound or a broken
limb, if she is not interfered with and
is permitted to do her work in her own
way. AM interference is prevented by
Stuart's D>>pejÂ»t?:a. Tablet?. *
Smart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
rale by druggists everywhere at 50
cents a box and if you are afflicted
with dyspepsia, one box will make you
feel ZO times better. Ycj wiil forget
you have a stomach and rejoice in the
forgetfulness. No drussist would be
so short-sighted as to try to get a!ons
without Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
for ;'-ey arc so popular and are so well
known for the good they have done
and the happiness they have caused
that any druggist caught without them
lose the confidence cf his cus-
tomers and be regarded as below the
standard. His business would suffer as
a result and his patrons would go to
other stores and buy their other drugs
there as - ell as their Stuart's Dyspep-
ela Tablets.
INTERVENTION OF AMERICAN
WILL COST HIM A SENTENCE
Judge Conlan Finds Fred P. Scott Guilty for
Battering a Russian in Argument Over the
War Question âSearch for Sister Rebuked
According to the latest and most
reliable sources, drawn from the Po
lice Court presided over by" Judge
Conlan, the Russo-Japanese war has
been "intervened" by America.
Wednesday night Fred P. Scott, who
claims descent from the commander
of the United States forces at the bat
tle of Vera Cruz, became involved in
an argument with Peter Vladivostok
Whitski, a native of the Volga River
section and an ardent Russian.
What happened to Whitski is really
too painful to tell. He looked on riv
ers of blood and he viewed the far
northern constellations. Sometimes
he grasped at shadowy forms of loved
ones long lost and they slipped from
his hands. It was a frightful quarter
of an hour.
When he awoke he was on neutral
ground in the saloon of A. Carlson, a
Swedish man. He was cared for like
a stricken soldier by the Red Cross
nurses, and Scott was Don Juan on
first base to aid the injured man.
There really was nothing but patriot
ism behind the assault.
Whitski viewed himself yesterday
morning and concluded he had been
sadly abused. That is the first con
clusion he would naturally come to
after he lamped around a bit. So he
swore out a warrant agaist Scott and
the case was before Judge Conlan yes
terday.
All would have been well for Scott
had it not been for a diminutive Jap,
who butted in unexpectedly. Scott
testified that the Russian, in discuss
ing the war, had made remarks about
the United States that an American
could not stand for reasonably. The
Russian was called to the stand and
said that he was not sure who hit him
and really couldn't identify his as
sailant. It came so suddenly, he said,
that it was like the Russian warships
in tha cold waters of Port Arthur.
He was hull-up before he knew it.
Scott and Whitski had evidently ar
ranged a protocol. Then along came
an intervenor in the person of Finna
hashi Marrideorr, a Jap, who is al
lowed the high privilege of cleaning
out the saloon where the trouble oc
curred. He testified that Scott was
the man who beat the Russian and
the witness thought Whitski got
merely what was coming. On this
testimony the Judge was compelled
to find Scott guilty of battery and will
sentence him to-day. It is about a
one to six bet that the sentence will
be lightly laid.

Charles Hanlon, who was gathered
into custody for disturbing the peace,
was before Judge Mogan yesterday.
He was arrested because he approach
ed a number of women conferences in
front of the ferry building, and when
the groups broke up he followed them
persistently.
He told the Ju^ge that he was look
ing for a long-lost sister, who left her
happy "home yeahs and yeahs ago."
He said he hoped to find her among
the groups in front of the ferry build
ing and his insistence In disturbing
bunches of women was due to the fact
that he hoped to recognize his missing
relative. The plea did not buy any
thing, and he was sentenced to three
months in the County Jail.

HAVANA, Feb. 11.â The report is

street saloon and her duties are to sell
beer at 51 per bottle. The strenuous
life she leads grated on her nerves
Wednesday night, and when a cus
tomer began to make light of her oc
cupation she threw a beer glass at
him. With the proverbial woman's
aim she missed her intended mark and
landed heavily on W. J. O'Neill, who
was on the firing line, and cut a deep
gash in his face.
O'Neill, who is employed as a ma
chinist at the Union Iron Works, had
no desire to prosecute, and Mary was
dismissed with an injunction to study
up on Rube "VVaddell and the art of

had been on a "whiz" that would put
an electric motor out of business in
seven and three-quarter minutes.
Joe Poheim, the tailof, and W. A.
Roberts, a liquor dealer, who accepted
Bowen's paper to the amount of two
$10 checks, told the court that they
had no desire to prosecute, as the mat

Bowen was allowed to journey back to

and Kruger wore them off, while a
menial messenger awaited; his coming
with payment for the raiment.
The police located the man in the at
tire and he was 'before Judge Fritz
yesterday. Lame excuses and previous
records were listened to and at the end
Kruger was given six months in the
County Jail, where he can get clothes
for nothing, if need be.
Chris Miller was so busily engaged In
reading The Gall bulletins of the Rus
so-Japanese war Wednesday night that
he forgot the expectorating ordinance.
Every time that an exclusive piece of
news'came forth he took another chew
of tobacco and said, "By Gar, d-e-e-s
is de stuff!" Then he spat plentifully
until the congregated crowd was In
danger of a flood.
Policeman . Dan Driscoll happened
along in time to keep the throng from
being overwhelmed by the yellow peril.
Judge Slogan dismissed Miller yester
day on the ground that the superior
war news furnished by The Call was
an excuse for making any one forget
an ordinance.
Theodore Ellenbach is one of those
fresh and dangerous Germans who

When the police finally ran him down

He was before Judge Fritz yesterday

SAY THEY HAVE A CORNER
OX THE RADIUM SUPPLY
Apents of British Capitalists Purchase
Land Bearlns Mineral PJtchblend
In Lower Callfoma.
SUPERIOR, WIs., Feb. 11.â Dr. J. G.
Barnsdale of this city and two English
physicians have what they claim will
prove to be a corner on the radium
supply, of this country. Representing
largely British capital, they have pur
chased 300.000 acres of land bearing
mineral pitchblend in Lower Califor
nia. They claim that the deposits on
these lands will enable them to cut the
price of radium from $6,000,000 to $2,
500,000 a pound.
Dr. Barnsdale, who Is a specialist in
X-ray work, lived in Lower California
more than twenty years ago, and at
that time discovered the land with
mineral pitchblend deposits. He never
supposed it would be of value, but re
cently decided to investigate. He and
his companions on their trip went from
the British Northwest to Mexico in their
search for all pitchblend deposits they
could find. The result was the pur
chase of 200.000 acres at $350,000. The
samples of pitchblend have been tested
and it Is claimed that the results sho.v
that the owners of these deposits wiil

Women Wlio Grumble at the~ Way
They Are Treated by Those Who
Should Be Deferential.
"Of course, like every other rational
mortal, I like to know all there is to
know abou* things, especially If it
costs nothing to acquire the informa
tion," said a bright little woman to her
companion as they were disposing of
an eclair and luncheon in a de
partment-store-last week. ."But 1 do
detest having a clerk â  treat me like a
regular baby and insist upon dabbling
out chinks of information about his
wares and even spelling the names of
some of them. That's what happened
to-day. I do not pretend to be a con
noisseur, but f. am reasonably familiar
with the art pottery that one sees In
the ordinary shop, and this little fel
low Insisted upon spelling the names of
all the stock for me, and adding dabs
of personal opinion as to the artistic
and commercial value of the different
wares. To cap the performance, he
toted me to a corner where there were
some freaky, ugly-,lOQkinE. things on
display and remarked with a nourish
of his arm and an air of undisputable
authority, 'These are gnomes, and the
word Is spelled k-n-o-m-e-s.' I escaped
and after lunch I'm going to look at
art pottery In a shop where the clerks
sell by pantomime."
"My experience was Just about the
same a couple of days ago," said- the
friend, "only the stock was furniture.
The clerk spelled 'Vernis-Martln' and
told me .how to pronounce it and gave
out some other nuggets from his store
house of knowledge. Then he showed
me some specimen rooms, among them
one fitted up in Louis XV style. I may
not know Louis XV furniture when I
see it, but I do know modern furniture,
so I got one inning and brought the
lecture to a close by asking 'why
twentieth century table and cabinet
â were included in the furnishings* of a
Louis XV room.' " â -Brooklyn Eagle.
A FUZZLIXG PROBLEM
IX EXCHANGE VALUES
Sharp Work of a Border Bum
â¢ Gives Thought for
. Financiers. .
"On New Year's eve, while we were
sitting out the old year, somebody
started the following appalling fiscal
problem. We have spent our time ever
since in seeking a solution, and are
now driven to ask your readers to help
us:
"In the United States a Mexican dol
lar has an exchange value of only 99
cents. In Mexico a United States dol
lar has the same value. On the fron
tier of the United States, where Texas
joins Mexico, are two drinking saloons,
one on each side of the frontier. A man
buya a 10-cent drink of whisky at the
American saloon and pays' with an
American dollar. He receives In
change a Mexican dollar. Therewithal
he goes to the Mexican saloon and buys
a drink of whisky, receiving an Ameri
can dollar in exchange. It is evident
that the limit to his purchasing power
is merely the length of time he can
continue on his feet. He wakes event
ually with a bad headache and the
original American dollar with which he
started.
"The puzzling question is â who paid
for the whisky?"â r i . James London
Gazette. ' ;
Plends "Official Death."
A curious incident occurred In an
English police court recently- when a
man named Travis was sentenced to
a month's Imprisonment for obtain
ing a postal order by false pretenses.
He pleaded that he was "officially
dead," and his story was that when
with the British army in South Af
rica he' deserted^-- obtained some
clothes from the Kaffirs, made his
way to the coast and worked his pass
age home. He then discovered" tha(
he, was reported dead, and though he
subsequently gave himself : up- as a

the front," and would not arrest him.

OCCURRENXE OF WARS AT
BEGINNING* OF CENTURIES
Belief That Nations Fight at the
Beginning of. Each Hun
' dred Years. '.
The superstitious notion is extant
that there must soon be a great war
because the opening years of every
century have always been thus
marked. Of course, If the latter were
true it would form no sufficient reason
for a war ''at. this time. A century is
not a natural division of time,, as Is a
day, a season or a year, but Is entirely
artificial, and there is no more reason
why war should occur at the beginning
than at. the middle or. the' end . of it.
However, as a matter of fact, the
statement" is not true, as every one at
all acquainted* with history should
know. ' ' '
The nineteenth century began with
the, establishment of more general
peace than the world had known for
many years, and if a couple of years
later war broke out it was o'nly the
renewal of the wars that had marked
the closing years of the preceding cen
tury. The eighteenth century began
with' wars,; "but they, were merely the
continuation of conflicts begun in the
seventeenth. . The early years of the
seventeenth were - marked with more
peace making' than war making. The
wars at the opening of the sixteenth
century were prolongations of those in
the fifteenth and were, at most, petty
affairs. â¢ Those at the opening, of the
fifteenth were; left over from the four
teenth. There .were no important wars
in the first years of the "fourteenth cen
tury, 'save those at Constantinople and
between England and Scotland, both
legacies from, the thirteenth. No great
war occurred in the first decade of the
thirteenth century or of the twelfth.
At the opening: of the eleventh Mah
mud of' Ghazni invaded India. The
tenth, was marked with no new war,
nor was the' ninth. The eighth was ten
years old when the Saracens invaded
Spain. The beginning of ; the seventh
was peaceful! .' The first . years of the
sixth and fifth saw Rome involved in
war, but- war^ was then the habitual
state of i Rome. ' The â¢ fourth and third
began in comparative peace. The sec
ond saw ho -new war, but rather the
ending of 'the old struggle in Dacia,
and the fierce conflicts of the early
years of the first century of our era
were merely the continuation of those
begun a dozen years before. In all
these last nineteen centuries, indeed,
not more than two are to be charged
with having opened with new and im
portant wars. Of the centuries before
our era, the first began in peace;, the
second with nothing but the. second
Macedonian war: the third with the
third Samnite. war; the fourth with no
great struggle; the fifth with the burn
ing of Sardls and the battle of Lake
Regillus, continuations of wars begun
long before: the sixth with Nebuchad
nezzar's conquest of Jerusalem* and In
the earlier centuries, so far as chronol
ogy informs us, there were' no initial
wars of magnitude. â¢ â  â¢
The current superstition, then, is In a
noteworthy degree contrary to the
facts. Instead of being Invariably or
even generally marked with the .out
breakings of great wars, the begin
nings of centuries have in the vast ma
jority of cases been remarkably free
from such catastrophes.. If. we were to
form any rule from historical - prece
dent'it would be. therefore, that this

British Orchids.
It may to many seem somewhat ex
traordinary to write of a field of or
chids in England; but such an occur
rence is not altogether uncommon. A'
few years ago, while botanizing in the
neighborhood of Burnham Beeches,
a correspondent in the Garden writes:
"I came upon the most beautiful dis
play of wild flowers it has ever been
my good fortune to see, namely, a
large field whose surface was a blaze
of color, varying from deep purple
almost to white, made by the flowers
of the early Orchis, O. Morlo. I have
never seen such a colony of this pret
ty little orchis, nor had I any idea
that it ever srrew so abundantly In our
meadows. I have, however, since
heard of other similar Instances."â

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES
BY NOTED MEN AND
WOMEN
Developing Tone.
BV VEiRXOX DAKN'AaE.
(Distinguished baryton* an<i. lÂ«*cturer en muÂ«ic
at the 1'nlvemity of Chicago.)
â¢ Copyriitht. I9O4. by Jo*Â»Â»ph B. Bowles. >
Having learned to breathe properly,
the next step for the student of the
voice will be the proper production of
tone.
What is the sensation when singing a
tone properly? In the first place, with
ihe lungs well filled and with freedom
from any contraction of the throat
muscles the tone should seek as a focus
the frontal bon^s of the face. But this
is easier said than done. There are a
hundred and fifty odd muscles in the
throat, and we all know what a small
thing it takes to disturb the production
of a perfect tone. A slight chip on a
violin or a small thread on a piano
Ftrinje may absolutely mar the beauty
of its tone, and so. with the voice a
Flight contraction of any of those 150
muscles which is not needed in the pro
duction of a tone may destroy its
beauty.
The sing-er's throat, so far as the
singer himself is concerned, in the
production of a tone should play no
part at all. It i? entirely passive. The
ideal to be obtained is a complete re
laxation of all ihe muscles around the
throat and the absolute lack of any
pressure which may disturb the natural
vibrations of tone. It is a good plan al
ways to think of the throat as if It were
wide open. Let one yawn, or perhaps
make a movement as If he expected to
drink, and hÂ» will have the sensation of
an open throat. Above all things, those
who are troubled with throatlness in
ringing should confine themselves to a
few tone's which are easy and lie in the
natural ppeaking voice, and perfect
these tones, gradually enlarging the
range around them until the habit of a
loose throat is established. A frequent
cause of a hard and throaty quality of
tone is found in the fact that the chin
and the lower jaw are stiff.
There are a number of exercises which
may be used with benefit by those *vho
have a tendency to stiffen the jaw. It
is difficult to describe Just how a vocal
exercise should lÂ»e carried out, but one
of the simplest for this defect is to use
the tone "ma" four or five times in suc
cession. In enunciating the "m" press
the lips together and then let the "a"
follow quickly and in an almost explo
sive way. taking care that the lower
jaw drops down and back quickly.
English-speaking people are troubled
most of all by this defect, because their
language calls for very few tones where
the mouth is really open. One of the
best cures for throatiness is to see that
the jaw is open in a relaxed manner
and yet that it falls back toward the
neck. The lower teeth should always be
under â or farther back than â the upper
teeth.
In the stiffening and hardening of
the throat thÂ«* tongue is one of the
worst foes to freedom. Unfortunately
â¢with this unruly member the more it
is discussed with the student the worse
it behaves itself. The tongue should
also be a passive factor in the produc
tion of tone. It should maintain Us
normal position in th<* mouth and be
allowed full liberty for its v/ork in
enunciating words and changing vowel
rounds. In trying to overcome the de
fects of tongue and jaw there is no
better remedy than constant daily
practice before the mirror.
So much for the muscular difficul
ties which every young singer will en
counter. Now as to the production of
tone, we shall concern ourselves with
its proper placement.
Nature has made for the singer a
fir.e sound board in the roof of. his
mouth. Besides this, in the large
nasal and head cavities as well
as in the walls of the jaw
and teeth he has reinforce
ment* which priye the voice sonority
and power. The control of the breath
after it has been converted into tone so
that it fills all of these resonance
chambers, thus producing beauty and
power of tone, with the least possible
physical effort, is the object of voice
placing.
The external sensation of a tone
thus brought forward should be felt
through the front of the face. Exer
cises for the accomplishment of this
object are numberless. Among the
most important is the use of the soft
nasal hum. Slany teachers do not use
this because it is difficult to acquire
always the proper mode of humming.
However, I think there is little danger
If it is done softly and confined at first
to the range of the speaking voice.
A good way to bring this hum to its
proper focus is .to sing softly "mum
mum-mum" and watch the tickling
sensation on the lips. This is an exer
cise which M. Jean ' de Reszke and
Mine. Emma Eames use constantly.
Behind the scenes' one may frequently
hear five or six worM-renowned sing
ers "tuning up," as n were, with this
simple exercise.
After practicing this exercise until
the student is sure that the vibrations
are front let him open the mouth and
sing the tone "Aw," striving to keep
the tone where the hum was. In this
way he will discover a number of tones
in the middle voice, which are more
or less perfectly placed. It should
then be his endeavor to perfect these
few tones easily within his reach, and
from the *?s'peri?nce !hn3 sained . he
may enlarge his range as far as his
voice will admit without forcing. The
average person has as a rule about
an octave of tones which can be sung
without great effort. One of the most
beautiful voices I have ever heard
started -with only three tones*.
The use of single sustained tones,
while censured occasionally, is never
theless the best means for the student
to study his own voice, since the dura
tion of tones gives him time to make
a note of sensation, to hear clearly
and to control the outlay of breath.
Should his throat crow rigid in the
effort to sustain the tone let him fol
low it. running .1 short scale of five
tones in a soft hum, taking care that
the vibrations are felt on his lips.
Another way to loosen the throat
is to come back to the breath exercise
of "panting:," singing: softly "ha" with
each outgoing breath, taking care that
the Jaw and throat are thoroughly re
laxed. Then let the student make the
effort 10 produce a tone, as if he were
sighing, first allowing: the tone to be
breathy and uncontrolled: then take
the sam tone, using more *tone and
less breath, and still keeping the jaw,
tongue and throat in the relaxed con
dition they occupied while "panting."
Although this exercise appears to be
very simple, it is one of the most im
portant of all vocal practices.
Strictly speaking, the two mechani
cal things with which the student of
voice is occupied should be a correct
attack and the ecualization of vocal
registers. The above exercises all
have their bearing upon vocal attack,
in so far as their object is to free the
voice from muscular pressure and to"
bring it front. Attack in its proper
use refers to the beginning of the tone:
The Germans have a better name for
it, "Ansatz," which conveys the idea
"to set on." Attack for the singer is
what the managemnt of the bow is
to the violinist. A tone should be com
menced firmly, held steadily and end
ed smoothly without a tremor, with
cut a scratch and without the sense
of force. Even the smallest pianis
simo should have all these qualities.
At the same time it is not desirable
for a young singer to attack his tones
too softly, since by this the tone is
liable to stick in the throat. Nothing
is more pernicious and productive of
bad habits than singing too loud. It
should be the young singer's ambition
to have the mouth full of tone and
the muscles concerned so free that the
tone seems to "float."
Although the singer may gain proper
breath support and have a free throat
and focus the tones forward, he will
tind at certain places in his voice the
occurrence of a break, when some new
mechanism or use of the voice seems to
take place. This brings us to the much
discussed question of vocal registers.
Strictly speaking, the female voice has
a chest register, a medium register and
a head register, while the male voice,
with the exception of the tenor, has
only tw\> registers, the medium and the
head. Just what causes the break in
registers is a mooted subject and one
which Is not yet settled. Certain it is
that for the singer there should at least
mentally not exist the conception of
the registers, although physically ne
must be intelligent enough to overcome
those breaks which occur.
In the equalization of registers the
upper should be brought down and
lapped over, as it were, the register
below, but the most pernicious of all
habits is to force a lower register ap
into a higher register. This is the cau3e
usually of all breaks. A bad break
between the chest and the middle voice
is of frequent occurrence among wo
men. . Here the constant practice of
bringing the medium voice down into
the chest register will gradually smooth
over the difficulty.
A splendid exercise to keep the voice
free from breaks Is to sing softly the
tone "Aw" with a slight nasal tinge.
Increasing the nasality as*one sings
high. A student may sing a whole
scale of an octave, or even ten notes
thus, and by emitting the tones very
carefully and softly will be able 10
avoid the breaks and different qualities
which occur frequently when using the
voice more powerfully. The use of
quick scales Is also excellent, provided
care is taken not to smear the tones
into each other. If the singer has ac
quired a perfectly free hum he will be
able to accomplish much in the way of
practice, because nothing so saves vocal
force and at the same time condenses
the voice into its proper channels.
The study of a sustained swelling and
diminishing of the tone should be the
singer's daily practice. Joachim, the
greatest violinist of our times, has all
his life devoted some time every day to
practicing long, sustained tones on the
violin in order to maintain a sure and
steady bow. So with the singer, study
of the swell and the diminuendo has
the same purpose vocally. In this way
the breath supply is regulated and,
above all, the quality of tone from its
commencement to its finish must be
kept the Fame.
The practice for high notes should
be a matter of the greatest care and
consideration. It is right here that the
majority of young singers are most
reckless in the expenditure of voice.
The high tones should be taken with
the same ease as are The low tones.
There should be no strain on the throat
and there should be the utmost care
to see that they ring in the proper
resonance cavity. It is a bad habit of
many young singers to strive for high
notes at the expense of vocal beauty.
The question too often asked is "How
high da you sing?" And this is used
as a criterion 0/ one's vocal endow
ment. The practice or the low notes,
particularly the chest tones, should not
be carried on by young singers. Above
all things, the middle register should
be beautifully and correctly developed.
If this is once accomplished both the
upper and the lower -voice will yield to
the proper treatment and the whole
voice will be improved In freshness and
vitality.
The young singer should make It a
rule not to practice over fifteen minutes
at a time, and to give the voice at
least a full hour between times.. Prac
ticing in this way, he may use the
voice altogether as much as an hcrur
and a. half to two. hours a day with
out fatigue.

A BRISK WAR.
FOR. a war less than a week old, the brush between
Russia and Japan has been not only brisk, but has
furnished several surprises interesting to professors
of the art of war. It is already evident that Japan has
made the same studied, systematic and careful prepara
tion that Germany made pnior to the Franco-Prussian
In that struggle it was found that Von Moltke was in
possession of the grade and condition of every 'French
road, had the measurement and weight capacity of every
bridge, and knew the topography of the country around
every French fortress and stronghold. Equipped with
this knowledge, no time was lost in marching backward.
The forts and their garrisons were left in the rear,
while the German forces marched around them to attack
unprotected cities and. to return and invest the garrisons
at their leisure, after isolating them.
The leaders of the Japanese navy were educated in this
country, learning their profession at Annapolis, and seem
not only to have absorbed the tactical knowledge neces
sary, but to have become impressed with the dash and
initiative which have characterized our navy from Paul
Jones to Dewey. They know the waters on which they
;tre fighting, and their gunnery is all that is to be desired.
In that, too, they have taken a lesson from our navy. In
the Spanish war we met ships that were our. equal in all
respects but that. One of the captured Spanish admirals
explained his flight by saying that the Government had
refused to furnish the navy with ammunition for gun
practice, and, therefore, in action h'e found his armament
useless because his men had no practice in handling it.
Japan has hot practiced that unwise economy, and so
her gunners are able to hit a ship in her vitals, either
above or below the water line. 'The next significant
action may be expected on land. It is believed in mili
tary circles, here and in Europe, that the Russian mili
tary force in Eastern Asia has been purposely over
stated by that Government. This belief is strengthened
by the capture of troop ships by the Japanese navy with
2000 soldiers on board. If Russia had the force she pre
tended to have, with the railroad to bring more, it is
hardly likely that she would be using transports and the
slower route by water to recruit her strength.
If it be true that the Japanese have cut the Siberian
railroad beyond Port Arthur, their land tactics rise to
an equality with their naval skill. With that road cut it
is probable that the military force available by Russia >s
less than that which Japan has within striking distance.
It will be very interesting if the Japanese tactics succeed
in actually equalizing her land strength with that of her
gigantic enemy. If the railroad be permanently crip
pled, and Port Arthur be invested by land and sea, there
will ensue a struggle of the most vivid interest to the
whole world.
If Port Arthur fall, the pride and prestige of Russia
fall with it. In possession of Japan the whole scheme
and military purpose of the trans-Siberian railroad arc
lost to Russia, for Port Arthur is the terminal of that
line, toward which it aimed from the time it left Slatoust,
in European Russia, and jumped the Ural Mountains.
Russia's long lease on Port -Arthur, for a ter
minal, was secured from China by craft and duress, and
Russia immediately began fortifying it likÂ£ another Gib
raltar, as an outpost of the empire. Of this there was no
necessity if the purpose of Russia were peaceful and not
sinister. The Canadian Pacific Railway has terminals in
the United States, and extensive running connections
with our roads, but they are for commercial purposes
only, and are not treated as advanced posts of the British
Empire. If the Japanese take Port Arthur, or by their
naval primacy isolate it from the sea, Russia's covert
plans will prove to have been merely putting her imperial
foot where it gets stepped on.
The Czar's empire gets but little sympathy in the cap
itals of Europe and almost none in the United States.
Along the Rhine the unspeakable inhumanity of the Cos
sacks is remembered, and the Western nations saw them
duplicated in China during the Boxer war. If it be the
destiny of Japan to avenge atrocities that are not in the
record of any savage people, the world will owe her its
thanks.
The sensational announcement has been made that the
Chinese Six Companies of Pittsburg have given material
aid to the authorities in capturing coolies that have resi
dence in the country in violation of law. It is patent
that the Six Companies of Pittsburg have absolutely
nothing in common with the Six Companies of San Fran
cisco. The Pittsburg outfit is suspiciously honest.
WAS IT BUNKO?
â¢m * R. BRYAN has done and said more remarkable
l\/\ and extraordinary things than have been said or
J. Y A done by any other American politician in all our
history. He has seemed a mixture and combination of
Jack Cade, John Wilkes, Robespierre, Karl Marx and
Solon Chase and "them steers." It seemed as though he
had exhausted his capacity to originate novelties in ex
pression and a'ction. But, when he returned from Europe,
saying that he had got one new idea, the country settled
itself in its chair to hear what it was. There were no
means of guessing it. The only way to catch it was to
watch Mr. Bryan until it escaped him, and then grab it.
There is a suspicion that he let it go in a speech at
Burlington, New Jersey, two weeks ago, in the form
of this statement: "I was put in, nomination twice by
my party, only because it was known there *was no
chance for my election." .
That is new enough and startling enough to have been
discovered by him during his European tour. -It is sug
gested by a Chicago paper that he got the idea from
Tolstoi that a man who really serves humanity, greatly
and beneficially, must be a martyr. It is in line with the
usual working of Mr. Bryan's mental processes, that he
regards his money theories as the offer of a sort of plan
of material salvation, of such conspicuous importance to
mankind that its author crowns himself with martyrdom.
There is no doubt that in 1896 he felt a more than hu
man commission to this work, for repeatedly, when
flushed by speaking to a crowd, he said to those around
him: "There is another evidence that I am divinely
called to free these people." It is entirely possible that
long contemplation has convinced him of his own in
fallibility and has confirmed him in the belief that his
financial theories are invested with a sort of supernat
ural sanction. In 1896 he declared this when he said that
"God has stored silver and gold in the earth in the exact
ratio of 16 to I." This made it a divine ratio and war
ranted him in treating all who opposed it as enemies of
a power higher than man.
By this analysis he appears as an instrument, an evan-
gel, the visible manifestation of a power invisible. But
all this being so, is it fairjn him to accuse his party of
playing a bunko game on him in his two candidacies? If
he is merely a hand lifted in the world by a power un
seen, was not the Democratic party under the same con
trol? An attentive reading of the Pentateuch excuses
Pharoah for his exactions of which the Israelites were
victims, because "The Lord hardened Pharoah's heart."
Pharoah could not help this cardiac induration, and un
der the principles of the commorf law would be acquitted
by a jury, at least. on the ground of contributory negli
gence by Moses and the others.
The declaration of Mr. Bryan reclassifies him. It is
easy now to understand his demand for disciples. He is
a monomaniac, no doubt more honestly under an illusion
than Dowie, the second Elijah.
At a recent poultry show in Salt Lake th<j, interest
ing discovery was made that many a fine bird. there on
exhibition had bogus- tail feathers pinned to the scrubby
appendage with' which nature had adorned it.
One does not have to go to a poultry show to learn
that fine feathers do not make .fine birds. A glimpse
into the foyer on an opera night is a revelation.
DESTROYING THE DEFECTIVE.
j-^RESIDENT ANDREWS of the University of Ne-
Iâ â * braska is the last college man to make a proposi
*â¢ tion that attracts attention, not because it is novel,
but because he indorses it. He thinks that society will
be benefited by destroying all weakly and defective chil
dren. The proposition is not new. nor is the plan un
tried. The Spartans exposed all weakly and defective
infants, that they might die and not live to .impair the
physical characteristics of the race; but there is in his
tory no evidence that the benefit to the Spartans physi
cally made good to them the loss morally.
The races and nations around them, and in their time,
that did not take such means to secure physical strength
were as potent in war, and the institutions they founded
and defended were as long lived. Other contemporary
states left a much deeper impression on the world, and
gave to science, art and literature an impulse that is not
yet spent. We do not recall a single case in which
Sparta in this respect was imitated by any of the ancient
civilizations; a failure which may be taken as evidence
that the results of the Spartan plan did not commend it.
But from the standpoint of that people it had some
justification. They had to maintain the independence
of their commonwealth by the .fighting power of their
people. War in that time was a matter of personal,
physical strength. Battles were decided by hand to
hand encounters. Spears and missiles were effective
only within the range determined by the strength of the
arm Which cast them. Before we blame the Spartans
for the cruel means they took to preserve their physique,
all of these things must be considered. When it is pro
posed to copy them now, it must be remembered that
their reason for such a policy no longer exists. Strength
of arm no longer counts in battle- 14 is replaced by the
expulsive force of powder. The weakest finger can pull
a trigger that explodes a charge capable of carrying a
bullet two miles. War is no longer hand to hand busi
ness. An army of prize-fighters matching muscle
against powder could be routed now by a company of
marksmen armed with the Krag-Jorgensen.
We may turn then to the moral effect that may be ex
pected to follow adoption of President Andrews' pro
posed revival of sacrifice of the weakly and defective.
If he have a defective child, is he willing to begin? If
not, that is the complete answer to the proposition.
Nature has put in the parental heart an affluent foun
tain of love and care for a defective child. For its com
fort no sacrifice is too great, no care a burden^ Instead
of its poor and weak life being an injury to society, it
keeps alive those tender impulses of the heart from
which radiate all the humane element that is in our
laws and our habits. Destroy the defective and this
humane impulse gradually dies'. If so monstrous a thing
were possible as for parents to assent to such a thing,
the very halo of motherhood would fade away, and the
hard heart of society would work out in laws and insti
tutions, and the charm of mercy and justice that is their
panoply would disappear. We would save the expense
of our institutions for the mute, blind and insane, of the
children's hospitals and the homes for the crippled and
distorted, but we would be. living in an intolerable world.
Such a policy would have strangled Helen Keller in her
infancy.
President Andrews may ask: "What economic value
is. there in the education of Helen Keller?" As well ask
what is the economic value of the march of Xenophon
and the 10,000 Greeks; in the "story of the loyalty to
Athens of the Plataeans; in that x of Horatius at the
bridge; in the victory of Hermann in the Teutoberger
wald; in the sufferings at Valley Forge and the sea fights
of old Ironsides! THey thrill in men that spirit that
makes states and institutions and defends them.
When children read the story of Helen Keller, living
in a world of everlasting darkness and grim silence,
overcoming the iron jailers of blindness and deafness
and muteness, and acquiring an education that opens to
her the pleasures of all literature and a knowledge of
all life, they are inspired to the best use of all their five
senses and of all their faculties, to make of themselves
the. best.
When President Andrews finds a cow so lean that she
will not defend her helpless calf against the wolves, he
may begin his search for human parents that will not
defend their weakly and defective young.
Dominican insurgents have murdered an American
sailor. That should be the signal for Washington to
exact immediate and terrifying vengeance. The mur
derous spitfires of Latin America need a lesson and they
seem to understand nothing that is not preached to them
in shot and shell. If these pests cannot be taught to
respect the American flag. they should be made to fear it.
The last of Uncle Sam's troops has left Cuba and the
restless little island has been consigned by the United
States to its own devices in working-out its scheme of
peace, prosperity, and civilization. The date for the first
Cuban revolution has not yet been fixed/ but it probably
will receive due announcement with all the necessary
spectacular effect.
It required eight shots from a revolver into the body
of a New Britain suicide to bring him the death he
sought. He could havesaved time/and energy by firing
one bullet into his head. The missile would probably
have encountered no resistance from wall to wall oPhis
skull.
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
The Price of a Life.
.Times are hard with the fiends â
opium and morphine slaves who mfest
the alleys in the Latin quarter. In
this, stormy weather visitors are few
and far between and so, as a matter
of course, are the nickels- and dimes
they usually throw to the creatures of
the drug habit. The users of morphine
seek almost in vain for the wherewithal
to purchase the little white pellets that
are to them food and drink, and the
devotees of the long bamboo pipe con
sider themselves extremely lucky if
in passing a "joint" they can get even
a faint whiff. of the Oriental drug.
A few nights ago two of them were
standing in a dark doorway, on Dupont
street alternately cursing their luck,
the weather and themselves. Suddenly
they saw a pedestrian approaching.
Their eyes lighted with a strange fire
and their faces wore a look of expect
ancy as they rushed toward him. "Give
us a dime, mister, for a cup of coffee,"
they asked in the same breath.
Carelessly and with a knowing laugh 1
the stranger took from his vest pocket I
what looked like a coin and cast it into
the gutter. The drug-hungered wretches
threw themselves on their hands and
knees and unmindful of the filth and i
slush that filled the gutter began a
search for the coin. For more than
five minutes they crawled about in the
slime and dirt. With their glassy eyes
strained they put forth their palsied
hands and raked over the dirt. Like
hawks they watched each other, and
when one made the least sound indie-,
ative of succ/ess the other pounced upon
him only to retreat with a curse and
resume his search when he found the
other empty handed.
Finally the taller of the two yelled
at the top of his weak voice and Jumped
to his feet. As fast as his trembling
limbs could carry him he ran in the
direction of a drugstore a block away.
His companion, with a snarl and a j
curse of disappointment, also rose and j
ran, striving with all his might to ;
overtake his lucky companion in mis- I
ery and calling him all sorts of names |
at every step. But the tall man only
ran on and on,, never for a moment
taking his eyes from the blue and green
lights of the druggist's shop. His
breath came in gasps, and more than
ence he placed his hand over his heart.
Just as he reached the entrance to
the store he fell on his face and with
a moan turned over on his back. His
companion, with a wolfish shout,
spurred forward and fell upon the pros
trate form. Eagerly he put forth a
shaking hand and grasped the tightly
clenched first of the man whom he had
chased. He could not unbend the stif
fened fingers, so he raised the hand to
his mouth and buried his yellow teeth
into the flesh. Still it refused to open
and the frenzied creature burst into
sobs.
When they found him there five min
utes later, crying like a child, they took
him to the hospital. The other was
removed to the Morgue. When his cold
fingers were straightened out in the
palm of his hand was found a tin to
bacco tag about the size of a dime.
Rare Michael Joseph.
When Michael Joseph Conboy. now
lieutenant of police, was doing patrol
duty at the base of Telegraph Hill He
was approached one day by a very ex
cited Italian who complained to him
that a frolicsome nannygoat had come
near\ eating up "his wife's baby," to
quote the language of the son of Italy.
The substance of the complaint was
that the^ Italian's wife put her ba"by
on the back porch, wrapped with a
white shawl, when the vagrant nanny
came along, gobbled up the white shawl
and dragged the Innocent baby out of
its carriage.
Conboy looked wise and scratched
his head a few minutes before answer
ing the questions put to him. Then all
of a sudden he replied:
"Under the treaty made with the
commonwealth of Milpetis and the de
cision of the Supreme Court of Sausil
luto that nannygoat must be annihil
ated; that Is the word, sir; annihilated;
shure, sir."
"Oh, thank you. signor; very wise
good officer," responded the. Italian, re
moving his hat. "Annihilata â thasa
ver' gude word-rannihrlata."
Pardonable Pride.
It is pardonable that any individual
or organization should take pride in
{-â¢raise for accomplishments well done.
The Call therefore offers no excuses for
offering to its readers the opinions of
others concerning Its efforts. From the
Alameda Argus the following good win
comes:
"The Call is a commendable paper,
and we are. glad to acknowledge the
fact. It has submerged many of the
traits that are too often found in the
big modern papers and that have come
Into fashion from the idea that the pub
lic demands them. The Call is giving
its attention to supplying the news and
the general reading jn a rational man
ner. We "are sure it finds that It pays.
The public ought certainly to appre
ciate any effort that is being made in
that direction."
The Modesto Herald has this good
word for us:
â¢'The San Francisco Call Is forging
ahead as a bright, live, newsy sheet at
a pace which is disconcerting to the
other dailies of the city. In every, de
partment and in its general tone and
make-up The Call is rapidly growing
into favor as a home paper, this fact
especially noticeable in the rural dis
tricts, where The Call has a constantly
growing circulation. Their new policy
of special writing, devoted to the inte
rior portions of the State, telling of the
various industries of these sections,
their growth and development, and Il
lustrating these articles with well
selected views, is especially pleasing:
and productive of much good In" the
work of development. The new Call is
receiving many most favorable notices
from the rural press of v the State, and
we are glad to record its progress."
Santa Rosa Republican the
following:
"Readers of "the San Francisco Call
must have noticed its steadily increas-
ing excellence the past few months.
The new editor is taking care of his
field, and he is making a public Journal
that is second to none at the metropo

French Nerve.
From one of the French' naval ports
comes an interesting: story of an inci
dent which recently occurred there. A
general holding a high command made
his appearance suddenly a few days
ago at the barracks of an Infantry regi
ment, which in obedience to his orders
was promptly drawn up in the yard.
Then he explained the reason in a brief
address. He said that as he was walk
ing in the town attired in mufti on the
previous day a man belonging to thÂ«
corps, who was the worse for liquor,
accosted him rudely and asked him to
stand him a drink. "Let him step out
of the ranks," he concluded. Imme
diately a bugler emerged, and saluting
said, "It Is I. mon general." The inci
dent is characteristic, and apropos of it
we are reminded of such an adventure
which befell a certain French marshal.
A grenadier who was exasperated at
some injustice that had been done him
pointed his pistol at him and pulled the
trigger, but it did not go off. Without
moving a muscle the veteran cried.
"Four days in the cells for keeping
your arms in a bad state." The bugler's
honesty can scarcely have failed to be
an extenuation of his offense in the
eyes of the general.
Sculptor Harvey.
The celebrated animal sculptor Ell
Harvey has just finished the execution
of two statues for the Louisiana Pur
chase Exposition, a bull and a steer.
These statues are to be enlarged to
gigantic size and will flank the entrance
to the agriculture building. The bull.
which is of the Normandy breed, win
be sixteen feet long, and was modeled
from a three-year-old bull on the Sulli
van County estate of Chester W.
Chapin. This animal is taken to typify
the highly bred domestic cattle, while
the Texas steer represents wild cattle.
Mr. Harvey's success as an animal
sculptor has been remarkable. His com
mission to execute the sculpture for the
new lion-house at Bronx Park, New
York, was one of the most important
of the kind ever given an American
sculptor. Harvey won his fame chiefly
abroad and has often exhibited in the
Paris Salon. He has won medals in
Paris and at the Pan-American for hia
animal sculpture, and in 1900 In Paris
he took the American Art Association
(John Wanamaker) prize for sculpture.

pMvents a disaster
Uullots Strike the Woman,

land BoHding Is Averted
â â¦ .
PORTLAND. Or.. Feb. 11.â A trag
edy of unusual fiendishness and which
narrowly missed being accompanied by
horrifying results, occurred this oven
ing in this city. Edmund D. Tobin, a
mining man from Baker City, this
State, visited the rooms of his divorced
wife in the Ainsworth block and begged
her to accord him an Interview.
Tho woman, who conducts a dress
making establishment, spurned the
man persistently, refusing to havÂ»Â» any.
ihins to do with him. Seeing that his
ex-wife was determined to avoid him.
Tobin drew a revolver and fired three
Fhots at the woman, two of the bullets
striking her body, but were deflected
by her corset steels and the third
pierced her arm. inflicting a serious
injury. Mrs. Tobin and a Mrs. Bur
phee. who was visiting her. rushed
from the apartment screaming.
Loft to himself, Tobin applied a
lighted match to a ten-pound box of
dynamite which he carried. From one
corner of the box protruded a fuse,
. i.hich was hidden in the folds of the
paper in which the box was wrapped.
Tobin then placed the muzzle of his
revolver to the back of his ear and
killed himself.
Attracted by the noise of the shots.
Robert F. Dean of the United States
recruiting service, who has an oftlce in
the Ainsworth building, rushed to Mrs.
Tnbin'R apartments, and. seeing the
box blazirg on the floor beside Tobin's
body, succeeded in extinguishing the
fiamep.
It was then that the full scope of
Tobin's horrifying plot was laid bare.
It appears that in his excitement Tobin
lighted the wrong corner of the box
and the flame had not yet reached the
fuse. There was enough dynamite in
the box to have demolished the Ains
worth building, which is one of the
largest business blocks in this city.
Had Tobin's plan not miscarried it Is
probable that a score or more lives
would have been sacrificed.
The Tobins were divorced last April.
Mrs. Tobin coming to this city from
Baker City to go into the dressmaking
business with a Mrs. Pin. Tobin has
been in this city for several weeks. lÂ»ut
his presence was unknown to Mrs.
Tr>bin until to-night, when he made his
appearance at her rooms, bent upon
â¢nurder of the most horrible descrip
tion.

BUISUN, Feb. 11.â A heavy rain com
menced falling this -afternoon. While
nothing in this vicinity has suffered so
far from lack of rain, to-day's precipi
tation was most welcome. Farmers
and orchardists throughout Solano
County feel elated over the present fa
vorable conditions.
COLUSA, Ftb. 11.â Rain fell here at
noon to-day and it is raining to-night.
All crops are in fine condition.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 11.â Sonoma
County was treated to a generous
Â«hower to-day, the precipitation being
estimated at about two inches since
morning. The rain began falling early
and has continued without a break
ever since. At times it fell in great
quantities and was accompanied by a
brisk wind. The season is well ad
vanced and everything Is growing
finely. Grass is tall and succulent and
stock Is doing well. At the present
time this county has had twenty inches
of rain for the season. This is about
two inches short of the last season at
a corresponding date, but sufficient
rain has fallen to insure abundant har
vests.
STOCKTON, Fob. 11.â Rain began
falling at 4 o'clock this afternoon, with
conditions excellent for a generous
downpour. Up to midnight the gauge
indicated .19 of an inch. While this
county was not in need of moisture the
raip will nevertheless be of much value
to ihe growing crops.

Storm in Marin County Nearly Causes
Wreck at Iloss Station.
SAN* RAFAEL. Feb. 11. â The storm
that visited Marin County to-night is
almost without parallel in severity.
Many acres of ground are inundated
and water surrounds the North Shore
Railroad depot. The train from Sau
salito which connects with the San
Francisco "theater boat" ran
through water for 200 yards near Ross
Station late to-ni&ht and came very
near being 1 wrecked. At Kempsfleld
there is something: of a flood and in
the house of an Italian the water is
several feet deep. The water is high
also at Larkspur and Escalle, and the
boathouses and arks are endangered.
KainfuJl Is General.
Rain fell generally in Central and
Northern California yesterday and last
night the storm was reported to be
making its way southward. The wind
was unusually high, a velocity of more
than fifty miles an hour being at
tained at various pofnts along shore.
The weather bureau officials predict
more rain for to-day.
DYNAMITE IS EXPLODED
UNDER RAILROAD IIRIDGE
Attempt Is Made to Wreck Property
of New York, New Haven and
Hartford Une.
ANSONIA, Conn.. Feb. 11.â An at
tempt was made last night to blow
up the railroad bridge being erected for
the New York. New Haven and Hart
ford Railroad across the Naugatuck
River here. Apparently the object was
to wreck one of the abutments and
also a big traveling crane which the
constructors, the Boston Bridge Com
pany, have placed in position for hand
ling girders. Little damage was done.
The bridee watchman was in his
shanty when he heard an explosion,
and looking out saw four men running
away. Later seven sticks of dynamite
were found about the structure.
The police are working on the theory
that the attempt was connected in
some way with the troubles which are
alleged io have been threatened fol
lowing the bridge company's refusal
to employ only union men on the
bridge.

MOUSE SCARE
AT CONVENTION
Fair Delegates to the Federa
tion of Women's Clubs Ke
ccivd Katlicr . Serious Shock
OFFICERS ARE ELECTED
Mrs. George Law Smith of
San Francisco Is Chosen Presi
dent to Succeed Mrs. Darling
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 11.â It re
mained for a wee mouse scare to stir
up the first semblance of excitement
that has so far disturbed the serenity
of^ the California Federation of
Women's Clubs. It was just before the
balloting began this morning and each
fair voter was trying not be nervous
over the important question she was to
decide, when somebody jumped up in
a startled way and somebody else
promptly screamed "Mouse!" Imme
diately half the assembly was wob
bling unsteadily from the uncertain
vantage of the revolving chairs, and
the silken skirts of the other half were
gathered safely out of reach of the
dreaded monster-mouse. Not until the
lady who started the commotion ex
plained that she "thought she smelled
smoke" did the fears of the timid legis
lators abate. â¢ Even then dainty ruffles
were frequently given a nervous shake
and many a furtive glance sought the
floor.
With such an auspicious start things
kept moving at a lively rate and the
scheduled events followed each other
in rapid succession.
For the first time in the history of
the federation the election of new State
officers was the most, absorbing topic
of the convention, owing to the fact
that the president will represent Cali
fornia at the General Federation of
Women's Clubs at St. Louis in May.
The three-cornered fight in the nom
inating committee, the quiet, smiling,
but deadly work carried on among the
different district delegations and the
usual dissatisfaction with the commit
tee's plans were very evident. The gen
eral result, however, seems to be fairly
satisfactory.
The precedent of a one-year term and
also of giving the presidency alter
nately to the north and south seems to
have been established. Mrs. L. F.
Darling gives place to Mrs. George
Law Smith of San Francisco as presi
dent. Mrs. J. E. Cowles of Los An
geles developed" such surprising
strength, both north and south of Te
hachapi, as to alarm Mrs. Smith's ad
herents for a time. It was with sxcat
relief they learned that Mrs. Cowles
would accept the second place of honor,
thus shutting out any possible nom
ination from the floor, which rnieht
have resulted in, defeat for the San
Francisco candidate.
Mrs. George W. Haight of Berkeley,
president of the Laurel Hall Club of
San Francisco, was nominated from
the floor by Miss Maria Babson of the
Oakland Ebell Club. Through a tech
nicality the nomination was not al
lowed. â¢
The large complimentary vote given
Mrs. Haight in the balloting, however,
Indicated that she would have made a
formidable fourth in the race for pres
idential honors had there been an or
ganized effort on the part of her
friends.
The following State officers were
elected:
President, lire. George Law Smith of San
FranclFco; vice president at large., Mrs. J. E.
<*owle.Â«, Los Angeles; corresponding secretary,
Mrs. Arthur W; Cornwall. San Francisco: r.e
cordlnK secretary. Mrs. Charles X. McLouth.
Pan JoÂ»e; treasurer, Mrs. Charles M. 13eck
with, Sacramento: auditor*. Mrs. Oliver C.
Bryants Ix>s Angeles, and Mrs. E. B. Wrenn.
Bakersfleld; State secretary to the General
Federation, Mr3. L. F. Darling: district vice
president* â San Francisco district. Mrs. A. E.
Osborne: Los Angeles district. Mrs. Frank E,
Prior; Kan Joaquin Valley district. Mrs. E. IJ.
Uujs; i?an Dietfo district, Mrs. Victor Mont-
Komery; Alamrda district, Mrs. Frank M. Wil
son; northern district, Mrs. W. II. Lawson.
The principal speakers of the morn
ing session were Mrs. Emma Fox,
Mrs. H. E. Thompson and Dr. Doro
thea Moore' of Juvenile Court fame.
The latter urged the women to keep
on "nagging the men to do what was
necessary to save not only the little
boys, but the big ones," from be.
coming criminal charges on the pub
lic.
An important resolution was offered
by Mrs. Kate Bulkley of Oakland, as
follows:
"Resolved, That the chairman of
the education committee be instruct
ed to recommend the clubs to unite
in an effort to raise $1000 to estab
lish a clubhouse for the women stu
dents of the University of California,
such clubhouse to be established by
the board of trustees of the clubhouse
loan fund and to be governed by the
rules put forth by that body."
Mrs. Bulklpy talked to the resolu
tion and considerable discussion fol
lowed, much interest being manifest
ed by the federation women.
The talk of Mrs. J. B. Hume of
Berkeley at the evening session on
"Mormonism" was one of the most
remarkable and eloquent of the fed
eration and was frequently interrupt
ed by applause. At times her state
ments seemed overdrawn, her statis
tic.! showing the startling growth of
Mormonism and its deadly menace to
the United States being almost in
credible. ' v
A. II. Elliott of Oakland was un
able to bo present, so Mrs. Robert
Burdettff took up the thread of his
chosen discourse, 'â¢Uniform Divorce
Law," nnd spoke at length in strongly
denunciatory terms of the present lax
ity of the marriage tie.
The defeat on Wednesday of the
proposed amendment to the constitu
tion eliminating the word "women's"
from the title of the Federation of
Women's Clubs came as a great sur
prise to the advocates of the measure.
The proposed change | having been
voted down by a vigorous' majority, it
Is doubtful if it ever will be suggested
Â«xain.
The convention before adjourning sine
die to-night passed resolutions favoring
the granting of lands in severalty to
landless Indians in Northern Califor
nia, and pledging loyalty to the Big
Trees.
After choosing delegates to the bien
nial convention' of the General Federa
tion at St. L.oufs the convention in
structed its delegates to St. Louis to
propose for president of the General
Federation Mrs. It. J. Burdette.
The convention tabled the resolution
of sympathy for Clara Barton . in her
Rea Cross troubles, and the resolution
favoring Bible literature study in the
schools was defeated.
Fatally Injured. by a Car.
Guelfo Giuliani of 1506 Polk street
died at the City and County Hospital
yesterday from a fractured skull re

when, becoming violent, he was sent

VIENNA, Feb. 11.â The Politiache
Correspondenz, a semi-official news
paper, to-day published a communica
tion from Constantinople, saying: that
in Turkish governmental circles the
conviction prevails that the present
situation in the Far East renders war
in Bulgaria Inevitable.
In view of this condition of affairs it
is considered unnecessary that the
Porte should burden Itself with the se
rious obligations Involved in carrying
out the principal measures of the re
form plans for Macedonia,
Commenting on this statement, the
paper says the fact that such an opin
ion prevails merits the most earnest at
tention of the interested powers.
. BERLIN, Feb. 12.â A dispatch to the
Lokal Anzeiger from Sofia. Bulgaria,
quotes a Government organ as saying,
in the course of an article en the war
in the Far East, that Bulgaria is
watching events in Eastern Asia with
close attention, as they may lead to
important developments for Bulgaria,
3UCHAREST, Roumania. Feb. 11.â
It is reported here that Premier
Stouddza has been sounded by the
Austro-Hungarian and Russian gov
ernments as to whether in the event
of the Macedonian movement assuming
Berlo'ia proportions in the spring, Rou
mania would accept a mandate from
the European powers to occupy Bulga
ria with troops.
According to the Statesman's year
book, the army of Roumania, on a war
footing, numbers about 170,000. The
war strength of Bulgaria is estimated
by the same authority as being about
205,000 men.
SEARLES . GAIjLKRY GAYLY
DECKED 1<X)R MARDI GRAS
Egyptian Pageant Will Re a Brilliant
Feature/ of the Annual
Festival.
The preliminaries of the Mardi
Gras ball are quite complete and the
decorations are nearly all in place.
Never before was the Searles gallery
so pretty as now in its -dress of violet
and yellow and hung with numberless
lanterns of carnival colors. Golden
spheres, birds, butterflies and numer
ous other things of the air and sea
float overhead and the effect is mag
ical.
The Egyptian pageant will be a
strong feature made up from the
members of the Alumni Association of
the School of Design, of which A. Alt
mann is president. These gorgeously
costumed sons of the Nile will have a
king trll their own, Newton J. Tharp,
who will reign for one brief night as
would become a king of the house of
Pharoah. And surely Isis must, be
there, but who the fair maid will be
is not vouchsafed to the inquiring
world.
Invitations that do not arrive before
Sunday will not be considered, but it
it is believed that nearly all who con
template attending have already at
tended to the matter.
Numerous groups of society maids
are plotting to attend in the same dis
guise, much as was the vogue last
year, when twenty Topsies, all the
same size and of the same circle, set
the guests' heads aglee.
The music for Tuesday night, will
be under the dirÂ«ction of Henry Hey
man.
Supper will be served at 11:30 and
600 guests may be accommodated at
once.

TAFT REVIEWS CONDITIONS
IN PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
Says Beneficial Effects From a. Politi
cal Standpoint Juslifv Purchase
of the Friar Lands.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 11.â Secretary
of War Taft reviewed conditions in the
Philippines before the House Commit
tee on Insular Affairs Wednesday. The
Secretary turned his attention to
the Patterson bill to abolish slavery in
the islands. He stated that there was
not the slightest objection to the pass
age of the bill, although in his judg
ment there was no cause for the meas
ure, as slavery had already been abol
ished legislatively by the terms of the
Philippine act. The Bates treaty, he
said, had been abrogated by the Sultan
of Sulu and his dattos, and he had for
warded a recommendation to the Secre
tary of War for its abrogation officially
by the United States. Secretary Taft
reviewed the friar land negotiations,
which had successfully been concluded.
While the Philippine Kovernment might
lose perhaps Jl.aOO.COO or 52,000,000 by
the purchase of the friar lands and
their subsequent sale to Filipinos, he
thought the beneficial effects from a
political standpoint amply justified the
transaction.
Secretary Taft will continue his ac
count of Philippine matters before the
committee at another time, aria will
also be heard later by the House Com
mittee on Merchant Marine and Fish
eries on the Philippine shipping bill.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 12, 1904.
BOSE ELY, A BACKED 100 TO 1 SHOT,
CAPTURES THE TWO-YEAR-OLD EVENT
Hildebrand Hasan
Off Day in the
caddie
Bose Ely, a two-year-old, was made
the medium of a "killing" yesterday
at Ingleside, A. Mr. Somebody from
Somewhere, report said Oakland,
backed the youngster from 100 to 1
down to 15 and 20. Boss Ely displayed
exceptional, speed in the slushy going,
outfootingr Edith Vice at the finish and
winning: by more than a length. Speak
er Fontana, the favorite, got cut off
! less than a furlong away from the
I judges and ran unplaced. After the
; race the man. from Oakland collected
â between $15,000 and $17,000, It was aaid,
and departed for home.
The admirers of Hildebrand spent a
wretched afternoon, as the crack light
weight did not land a winner. Glls
sando and Letola were the only short- 1
priced horses to capture purses. Rain
fell almost continually and the track
was a sea of mud.
BELIj AND WHISKERS FAIL.
Bell rode "Whiskers In the introduc
tory sprint. From 9 to 5 the price about
the Petaluma horse went to 2*4 and
Bell and Whiskers finished third.' Fair
Lady Anna, which ran for the Native
Sens on Wednesday, was a starter in
this number. With Solomon Bonner
again at the wheel and heavily played
at 3 and 4 to 1, the mare led from start
to finish, beating out Handpress two
lengths.
A grand aggregation of. platers start
ed in the mile selling affair. Nothing
I was known about the condition of Glis
sando, so he closed a slight favorite
over Emily Oliver. Pastmaster was
blessed with some speed, but Glissando
held him safe, scoring without effort
by three lengths. Emily Oliver finished
in the show. Norford had Gruwell on
his back again and the young man is
certainly a crude piece of workmanship.
In the hurry and confusion to back
Walter Jennings' Stllicho to win the.
mile and seventy yard run the shrewd
ones overlooked everything else. Daisy
Green had Hildebrand up, but that ap
peared to cut no figure yesterday.
STIIJCIIO AWAY BADLY.
Unfortunately Jack Martin got awtty
from the post badly with Stilicho, fin
ishing third. The Don. a 15 to 1 shot
piloted by Travers, made all the run
ning and at the wire downed Esherin a
length with nothing to spare.
With Hildebrand up. Letola, another
from the Jennings stable, would have
been a 1 to 2 chance to annex the six
furlong selling affair. With Willie Daly
in the saddle some 7 to 5 was obtain
able and the fast filly won in a gallop.
Bombardier outstayed George Berry,
taking the place.
Mike Daly's three-year-old Sailor
Knot r was backed from 4 to 2 in the
speculating on the concluding mile and
fifty yard- event, and a poor send-off
spoiled a good thing. The colt was
pounds the best, but did not get away,
running a close third. Ridden out, G.
W. Trahern, an 11 to 1 shot, led Axmin
ster, the second choice, past the judges
less than a length.
XOTKS OP TIIE TRACK.
Bell was highly complimented for his
ride on Whiskers â by the admirers of
Fair Lady Anna.
On his previous race Bose Ely
looked a certainty to win the two
year-old race. That is, if one had the
nerve.
My Order is a good-looking two-year
old and won't be a maiden long.
O'Hagen ran a poor race for a mud
lark. He may start again this week.
From a dispatch received at the
track yesterday it was learned that a
Victorian sport named Ross made a
$500 bet at Seattle that George Berry
would beat Bombardier. Ross wired
E. G. Harmon, trainer of George Ber
ry, that he was in on half, the bet if
Btvry won. Bombardier finished second
without much effort. â¢
Steve Judge sold Mr. Dingle yester
day to E. Tierney.
Barney Schreiber took a trip to Los
Angeles and has no book on this cut
in.

SEEKS LIGHT
ON DIVIDENDS
Stockholder in the United States
Steel Corporation Begins
Some Interesting Litigation
TRENTON, N. J., Feb. 11.â Alfred F.
Stevens of Newark to-day instituted
suit in the Court of Chancery against
the United States Steel .Corporation to
have that corporation show cause why
it first increased and subsequently dis
continued payment of dividends on its
common stock.
Stevens in his petition claims that
the steel company since its incorpora
tion has had net earnings over and
above its fixed charges of about $65,000,
000. Of this amount $18,000,000 was
earned in 1901, $34,000,000 in 1902 and
$11,000,000 in 1903. He claims that under
Its charter the corporation is obliged to
pay quarterly dividends to the extent
of 4 per. cent per annum; that In Octo
ber, 1903, a dividend of only one-half
of 1 per cent, or at the rate of 2 pef
cent per annum, was declared, and that
in January. 1904, no dividend at all was
declared on the common stock. He at
tacks the validity of the recent by-laws
of the corporation, which authorize the
directors to set aside from the earnings
of the company from time to time such
amounts as they may determine.
Stevens contends that the by-law Is
in violation of his rights as a stock
holder; that he owned his stock before
this by-law was adopted, and that he
never consented to Its adoption. He al
leges that even under this by-law, no
money was set aside for working capital
until February. 1904, whereas it was
prior to this that the dividend of Octo
ber, 1903, was reduced and the one of
January, 1904, was passed.

WATER RATE
IS DISCUSSED
Supervisors Meet as InYestigat
ing Committee to Examine
Affairs of Spring Valley
The Board of Supervisors met last
night as a committee of the. whole and
devoted two hours and a -half to the
Investigation into the affairs of the
Spring Valley Water Company, with
a view to fixing the water rate for the
coming year. In the absence of the
Mayor, Supervisor d'Ancona acted as
chairman.
The Spring Valley Company was rep
resented by its chief attorney, M. B.
Kellogg; Pelham Ames, secretary of
the company; George E. Booker, head
bookkeeper; M. Garoutte. assistant
bookkeeper, and Assistant Engineer
Williams. These men successfully
evaded all questions put to them that
had a tendency toward eliciting an
swers that would give to the board the
value of the water works.
Much of the time was taken up In an
attempt on the part of the investicat
ing committee to secure information
concerning the property owned, the
property not now in use and the oroD
erty mentioned in tho reports of the
water company not now beinc used in
the production of water for the city.
WILLIAMS- IS GUARDED. ; / ."
Assistant Engineer Williams did
most of the explaining, but whenever
a question . was put '. the answer to
which would give the committee any
light on the holdings and the value of
the same Tty the company, he was not
ready, or did not remember the data.
Attorney Kellogg was Asked to tes
tify as to the value of the company's
property, but said he could not do so
until he had consulted his superiors.
The Spring Valley Company still main
tains that the value of its plant Is $40,
000.0C0. while City Engineer Grunsky
says that it is worth but $24,000,000.
It is evident that the. investipatinj?
committee will be confronted with as
much trouble in ascertaining what is
necessary for it to know in order to
fix the water, rate for the coming year
as it has .experienced in previous in
vestigations. The Spring Valley Com
pany filed a report estimating the ope
rating exnenses for the fiscal year of
1904-05 at $560,000.
LIST OF QUESTIONS.
Engineer Grunsky was not satisfied
with the enumeration of the estimated
operating expenses for the comins: year
and dictated a number of questions,
to be nns wered by the company next
week," the oj)ject of the questions be
ing to obtain from the Spring Valley
Company a more detailed account of
expenses.
The Spring Valley reports did not
give the amount of land owned by the
company. All efforts to get the truth
In this matter were fruitless.
Attorney Kellogg was asked by Su
pervisor â¢ Brandensteln if all of the
property of the, Spring Valley had been
enumerated in : the reports filed with
the committee. He refused to answer
the question one way. or another until
the next meeting. 1 , so that he mijjht
have a chance to consult h!-3 employers.
When the committee found that the
water company was not prepared to
give .the testimony that was most
necessary, the meeting was adjourned
until next Wednesday.
BOXING CLUBS
MAKE NEW LAWS
Kocently Formed Association
Assumes Jurisdiction Over
the Amateur Glove Artists
ALLOWS MEN EXPENSES
Managers Agree Not to Bid
More Than $35 for Any One
3Iatch Under Penalty of Fine
The managers of the various amateur
boxing clubs of this city and of Oak
land met at the Hayes Valley Athletic
Club last night a'nd perfected their in
dependent boxing organization, which
will hereafter govern the game here
and across the bay. When the new as
sociation was completed the representa
tives of the various clubs declared
themselves no longer under the control
of the Pacific Athletic Association.
The new combine will be known as
the California Amateur Athletic Asso
ciation, and to-day it will be duly In
corporated under the laws of the State
and city. Its membership consists of
the Bay City, Hayes Valley, Lincoln
and San Francisco clubs of this city
arid the Sequoia Club of Oakland.
The following officers were chbsen to
serve for one year: President, E. J.
Kaplan; vice president, Matthew Rlley:
secretary, E. J. Harrington; treasurer,
Eugene Pfaeffle; board of directors â
Morris Levy, E. J. Harrington. William
J. Winterbottom. Sol Levinson and
Matthew Riley. A committee composed
of Al Murphy, Sol Levinson and Morris
Levy was appointed to see that the
rules of the new association were car
ried out while the by-laws are being
prepared^ j
The association will apparently have
absolute control of the amateur boxing
game in this city, the Supervisors hav
ing recognized it as the governing au
thority.* Under the new regime no boxer
will under any circumstances be al
lowed a prize to exceed $35 for appear
ing In a ring contest. This amount will
include the trophy and his training ex
penses.
Each club will be compelled to post a
forfeit to guarantee that It will live up
to the by-laws of the association, and
any club falling to keep its faith will
be summarily dismissed from member
ship and not allowed into the fold
again under any circumstances.
A committee composed of E. J. Har
rington, Al Murphy and Sol Levinson
was appointed to frame the by-laws.
The members will meet next Monday
night, and this part of the programme
will then be arranged.
The West Oakland Club of Oakland
was not represented Â«.t the meeting,
but will probably send a delegate to the
next session, when It will be formally
admitted to membership.
The San Francisco Club sent E. J.
Harrington as a delegate, and this re
moves all doubt as to the attitude as
sumed by the sonthslde organization. It
was rumored that Alex Greggalns
would cast in his lot with the Pacific
Athletic Association, but this proved
untrue.
Tradition In Architecture.
Professor Hamlin, writing In the
Forum, has the following remarks on
tradition in architecture: "The Euro
pean designers have been so carried
away with the freedom of the 'new
art' that in architecture, where law
must reign at least in a measure, they
have allowed the freedom of the new
spirit in design to degenerate into li
cense and even anarchy. The reason
of this is clear. Tradition, which has
always, in architectural styles, minis
tered for a while to progress In re
finement, by concentrating all effort
upon the perfecting of the details of
the style, has just as uniformly in the
end led to sterility In design and then
to a final reaction. This is what is
taking place in France, Belgium. Ger
many and Austria, where the too
academic formality of the long ac
cepted classic revival has bred weari
ness and revolt."
Professors of Engineering.
One of the problems to which engi
neering schools ought to give imme
diate and serious consideration has,
says Cassier's Magazine, grown out of
the practice of obtaining professors.. by
"In-breeding." as it has been charac
terized, meaning by this the recruiting
of the young teachers, soon to be de
veloped into full-fledged professors
from among recent graduates, with
little more than their school experi
ence to their credit. This damages the
school. There have been occasional
lectures by prominent engineers, act
ively engaged in professional work,
and now and then men fresh from en
gineering fields have been secured as
the heads of engineering school de
partments. But these are only Iso
lated examples of what should be
general practice.
Pathos and Bathos.
Not all the sacrifice as between hu
man beings and animals lies with the
brutes. Charles I's Queen, driven by
Cromwell's cannonade from the house
In v/hich she had sought asylum
at Burlington Bay, remembered that
she had left a lapdog in th?
house and returned under a heavy fire
to recover It. Lord Methuen's grand
father took a crew of British tars with
him to rescue a 'dog from a burning
ship; and more recently, General von
Sehwarzoff lost his life in attempting
to save that of his hound In a burning
building at Peking. Byron thought
more of his pet goose than of all the
fair women who offered themselves un
conditionally to him. He -had bought
the bird to fatten up for his Michael
mas day dinner. In the interregnum
the poet and the bird, became so mu
tually attached that he could not kill
it.- Instead, he bought another, and
had the pet goose swung in a cage un
der his carriage when hs traveled. In
time the matronly bird reared three
more. â St. James (London) Gazette.
The trouble with the chronic kicker
is that he is too busy klckinR to take
the. trouble to lind out what he's kick
ing about. '
When one is jilted nowadaysâ there's
many a good fish in* the market.

Ruf" us P. Jenningrs, executive officer
of the California Promotion Commit
tee, has made a report to thÂ» commit
tee relative to the growth of Califor
nia's population, thÂ© substance of
which is as follows:
Inquiries have been Â«ent to all county clerk*
of the State asking for Â«stlina.teÂ» en lncrÂ«a*Â»
in population sine* th,Â« census of 1900. Re
turns receired to date ahow mich lncreaÂ»Â« to
be from 15 to 35 per cent, 'and postal receipt*
show a corresponding Increase. TnesÂ» return*
Indicate a great Increase ln.t&e population of
California durin* the last UirÂ«Â« years.
The population of California, in 190O waa X.
4S3.O53. ehowlnjr an Increase over that of 1S9O
of 270,923. Assuming on & conservative esti
mate, based on returns already received, taat
the population of the Stata has increased, 20
per cent since 1900, an increase- would bÂ«
ehown of 237.000 for the three years, or 20.000
I more than the total Increase for the ten year*
previous. At this rate the population of Cali
fornia at the time of thÂ® census of 1910 will
be approximately 2.5OO.00O. It is estimated
that San Francisco alone has Increased over
10O.C0O people since 1B00. A conservative entl
mate places the population to-day at 43O.f >>.
Thla Is exclusive of the bay cities fcmmediately
adjacent to San Francisco, the population of
which can be safely estimated at 13Â«Â».0<X>. mat
ins in all CW.0CO people about the Bay of Saa
Francisco.
CITY'S GREAT GROWTH.
The population of San Francisco proper la
1*00 was 20S.COO. In 1900 042.782. or an In
crease in the ten years of 43.7S3. or 4378 Â»aeh
year. Tie population in 1003. estimated at
4.V\00O. would show an increase over that of
l'JOO of T07.COO. about i>Â«Â«.00O each year, or
nearly nine time* greater than the yearly aver
age for the ten years previous. LoÂ« AnÂ«elÂ»*.
th* second largest city In th* State, had la
1.S90 a population of SO.3U5; In 1900. 102,4.9.
thawing an Increase of 52.CS4. or 62CS each
year. The population of Los Angeles In ldU.
an given by the Clerk of L^s Angeles County.
Is estimated at 150.000. an increase In th*
thres years of 47.521. being 15.S4O each year,
or three times greater than the yearly averag*
for the ten years previous.
From latest official returns it Is shown that
121.9C3 persons took advantage of th<Â» colonist
rates to California durlnjc the periods that
colonists' rates were In force, namely. March
and Ariil and SpjUember and October, \9*Vi:
February 15 to June 15. 1903, and September
15 to November 15. 19Â«tt. a total of 31Â» days.

tinue for sixty rtayÂ«. A review of these figures
is rtsniflcant as fhowinx a much larger per
centage it inrrÂ»ase in population during thÂ«
three years Just passed than that cf the ten
years vrev'ous. Particular attention Is called
to the larser number of colonists comins to
California In 1W, than In 1002. all of which
points to th<* fact that the systematic ar..*. well
dlreetea work of the committee is producing
results.
The California Promotion Commute*
has made plans to have a dinner at th-Â»
St. Francis Hotel in the latter part of
March, this to be thÂ» first function held
in the new hotel. This was announced
at a meeting of the committee yester
day. Circulars have been sent nut to
associate members, so it was reported.
in which each member is asked to
bring in two more members. The com
mittee is arranprinpr with European
newspapers to publish articles on Cali

DEATH CLAIMS
YOUNG HEIRESS
Mrs. Gopchcviicli, the Wife of
Reputed Servian Nobleman,
Expires After Long Illness
The romantic courtship and marriage
of Miss Harry A. L. Floyd and M. B.
Gopchevitch, a gripman and a scion of
a. reputed noble Servian family, has
tnded in the death of the bride of a
few months, who passed away at dawn
yesterday.
It was the la Ft chapter of a romance
that was both pretty and sensational.
L*eath called the young bride and heir
ess ere she had an opportunity to en
juy her vast wealth or take her hus
b~nd to the Old World, where his title
and rank might ;>erehance have been
given due recognition.
.Mis. Gopthevitch had been in poor
health for some time, in fact ever since
ihe day uf her marriage' last October.
A fexv weeks ago she became very ill
and all hope of saving her life was
abandoned. She rallied, however, and
uetxneA to be on the road. to recovery,
but a relapse set in a few days since
&r.d death claimed the young bride.
The beautiful mansion on Sacramento
street where the couple lived is shroud
ed in gloom. â¢ The husband makes
known to the world that he is pros
trated and unable to receive the words
of sympathy which friends offered to
extend yesterday.
ROMANTIC COURTSHIP.
The deceased bride had no near rel
atives and consequently her widower
has an excellent chance of becoming
the sole possessor of her princely es
tate or of a large part of it. Whether
cr not Mrs. Gopchevitch left a will
remains to be seen. It is believed that
rhe made ample provision for her hus
band, to whom she was devoted.
The lovemaking of Gopchevitch was
lomantic. He was a gripman on the
Sacramento street cable line. One day
â while ridi.Tg downtown M^ss Floyd
looked into the eyes of the man who
v.as running the car on which she was
seated. Her glance was returned and
each was conscious of the other's love.
They beheld each other on many uc
casions thereafter, their acquaintance
soon ripened into love, and on October
6 last the pair hied themselves to Miss
Floyd's beautiful country home near
Lakeport and there were made husband
and wife bv Judge Sayre of the Su
perior Court of Lake County.
No one knew of the romantic mar
riage, not even the closest friends of
the bride. They returned to this city
a few days later and informed their
friends whal had happened. Just how
the acquaintances of the lady received
the news was never made public, but
the was always a strong-minded per
son and mistress of her own affairs.
ESTATE LEFT i.V TRUST.
Kver sine* the marriage the couple
had resided quietly in this city. The
health of the bride had been delicate
and she was not granted the oppor
tunity of enjoying her vast wealth. The
pair were hnppy together.
Mi?s Floyd was the daughter of the

a quarrel with one of the Mexicans, but
this nuarrel had been patched up dur

NEEDHAM TALKS
FOR CALIFORNIA
Congressman Urges That Thi3
State Be Selected as* Location
for the Maneuver Grounds
Special Dispatch to The Call
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.âRepresen
tative Needham appeared before the
House Committee on Military Affairs
this morning and made a telling ad
dress, not in behalf of any one of the
sites for a camp and maneuver grounds
claiming preference in California, but
for the State as a location against any
other State on the coast. His speech
was a business and common sense ar
gument against theory and sentiment.
He set forth that the California Na
tional - Guard numbered 3400 and the
regulars now stationed in the State
7300, or nearly 11,000 *Tnen to be moved
long distances by rail or ' steamer
should the camp be located in some
other State. Washington, which is the
only competitor on the coast for the
camp ground, has but 800 militiamen
and only 2200 regulars are stationed
there. The number of both militia and
regulars In Oregon, Idaho and Arizona
which would be mobilized at the camp
is very email. The cost of transporta
tion and the time spent en route by a
larger body of men seemed to Needham
a factor of such importance as to al
most necessarily determine the location
in California. As between the several
sites under consideration, he declared
he had no word to say, but thought
that this, and, indeed, the whole mat
ter, could be safely left to the War De
partment.
Representatives Cushman and Jones
of Washington will be heard next
Tuesday in behalf of the claims of that
State.
Several bills introduced a few days
ago by Senator Perkins, making appro
priations for the improvement of the
lighthouse service along the Pacific
Coast and by Senator Foster in the in
terest of the same in Puget Sound and
en the Washington coast were reported
favorably from the committee to-day.

OPEN VERDICT
IN MOAK CASE
Inquest Fails to Throw Any
Light on 3Iysterious Murder
of Young Woman Near Chico
CHICO, Feb. 11.â The Coroner held
an inquest to-day in the case of Eva
Moak. the young woman who was shot
on her mother's ranch near here Tues
day and Â«who died on Wednesday. A
verdict of murder by some unknown
party was returned by the Jury.
James Moak, brother of the deceased,
testified that on Wednesday night he
received a communication that caused
him to suspect a certain person. The
name of the suspect was not divulged,
but was given to the District Attorney.
The theory that the young woman
knew her assailant and shielded him is
not credited in the face of the testi
mony of the family. Each member of
the family declares that the dead girl
did not know her assailant and repeat
edly so stated. Mrs. Moak testified
concerning her daughter's flight from
the barn to the residence, bleeding
from three wounds. She also told of
the measures taken for the girl's relief.
None of the family noticed any one
about the barn or ranch.
The peddler who claims to have seen
the body of a man in Butte Creek to
day said the body was covered with
slime and appeared as if It had been in
the water for several weeks. The body
was not found, though the creek was
searched for a mile.
The officers are workjng on a theory,
but decline to talk for publication.

ground that at the time the document
was made her father was not of
sound mind and that further his mind
had been poisoned against her by her
brothers.
The province of the Jury was to
answer two questions. The first was
as to whether Descaiso was incompe
tent. The decision was nine to three
in favor of incompetency. The sec
ond was as to whether undue influ
ence had been brought to bear. On
this question the jury disagreed. It
was out half an hour.

Fire. <n the basement of the premises
at 525 Union street, occupied by Mich
ele Foglia as a grocery and bar, shortly
after C o'clock last night, caused slight
damage by smoke and water. The
property Is owned by D. Cervall! and
the origin of the blaze is unknown.
John de Luccl. who resides on the sec
ond floor of the building, upon being
advised of the fire, climbed to the roof,
and in endeavoring to cross to an ad
joining building , fell through' a lisht
â well, striking the ground fifty, feet be
low. He miraculously escaped fatal in
juries and was taken to the Harbor
Hospital, where it was found upon ex
amination that his right shoulder had
been fractured.
The sexton who gave his love a dia- j
mond sparkler on their engagement I
was merely ringing the belle as usual. J

. Crop and Stock of Beans.
The circular of the Schuitz-Hansen Company
e$j s of beans :
'â¢Since our last ttati?tical review of Septem-
Jx-r. 1903. the bean crop of r.*>3 has been har
vested. i>art!y marketej, and a portion ware- !
houwed throushr>ut Â»he State. For the flrst |
t!?".je in years growers have ..eld back ship- I
ting,' warehousing and marketing, and at pres- j
Â«r.t there i>re mere ' beans on the ranches j
stored to larns than ever b<Â»:ore in the history j
of the .State. A fallin? rr.nrket and Inactive j
demand created among th-? trrowers a wide
t-l-reau difpcsition to hold their uroduct on
the ran--h and ehii) to market only when sale
Â«i; made in advance. This holding back has j
made it difficult for the exchanges and mer- j
chants to arrive at accurate figures as tÂ» the
â¢tacks in the State December 1. and the result
has been that up to the present date no re
liable firures have be*n given as i<.Â» the crup :
estimates of 1SW3.
"From various t=tate agents, interior ware- i
hous* connections and growers, -we have care- I
fully complied an wrtimate ot stocks of beans !
on hsr.d February 1. 1004. amounting to TOO.- |
V*' *acks. Of thiÂ« amount 4tÂ«>.<XÂ«) &acks are (
conceded to be Hrr.as. the balance consisting of j
large and small whites. Bayos. pinks and
Mackeyes. The stocks ot i^inks are the light
â¦*t in years, and with only a fair demand be
tween now and October 1 there will not be
pink beans enough to supply this trade. A
eharp advance is looked for. _
"The wiener trade from the F-arPfor Cali
fornia beans was- very light, which was due
to the cheapness of Michigan etocks, T>ad
leather conditions and a tight money market.
However, at the present writing, these condi
tions are completely turnefi ground: the East
ern m<ne- market is easy, an.l most all points
â¢ re now arXing tat sampler and quotations of
the California rroduct.
"A weather condition Is now confronting the
â¢outhern part of The Ptate that, unlesn that
â ectloa of the State that produces all the
limas. [inÂ» whites and bla^ker-e* gets on an
â  verage nix inches of rain between m>w and
Way 1, the bÂ»an crop, ss far as Southern Call- j
Jo:x:a if concerned, will be light."
Panama Canal Payment.
â Late msll edviceÂ» from New Tork say of
the Panaiaa canal paym* nt :
"The announcement that the Gr.vprnment hart
ti'^Ct-4 to make- a call of 20 per cent of the
publ!': fua^s Oil deposit with national barks
toward thf f54t.OCO.CKJO canal payment was some
Â»ha.t of a surprise. Additional calls of 10
per r-ent v.-i!l follow until the full payment
is rr.a-if-; and r-fficial assurance is given that
the payment will be conducted po as to create
the least possible effect upon the money roar
k*t/ The valur of th"sÂ« assurances depÂ«nds
very largely â .-,-, circumstances which the
Btcretmrj cannnt control. | <joid export* can
rossib'.y be averted provided there U a suffl
rt*-nt supply of exchange in which to Invest,
the .pruc^Mie of wnkh crÂ»jM be at once re
Â«Jercrft~l in o^r banks. The payment to Eu
rope, however, will bÂ« materially lessened liy
the jeet that a. verj' confiderable portion, per
haps half, of the Panama stock is already
he',d n. the United Stales. Unfortunately thÂ«
prirsent high price* of cotton and wlvat do
not encourage exports, and while hitherto we
have ltrs*!y profits by the*Â» fipureÂ« and the
supply cf bills has been large. Indications fuk
gcsl that values have resetted the limit for
expert. The monetary kltuatlon Js further
complicated by tfc'e fict that .bank loam In
New Tork have expanded over $100,000,003
during the la*t five weeks end nrrtir stand near
t$* fl.OOO.OOO.fiOO mark. It in quite evident,
therefore, that should any further rtrcis be
put upon the money market there will be a
calling of loans ar.d a consequent increase in
Interest ratee. r.'tr.k officials, bovevcr, chow

Nezc York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 11.â Only three or, four
stock? of the fiist importance got as much as j
a joint away from last 'night' a level at any
time to-day. This serves to Illustrate the life
leÂ»-eness ot the trading and the sluggishness of
the stock market. The Imminence ot a holiday
mi in yart the cause of this stagnation. The |
smallness of the speculative position now open j
was thus clearly indicated, the approach of a|
holiday usually prompting traders to close up j
their accounts. This would be especially true I
with the extra uncertainties of a time of war. i
The uncertain wa\-ering of the market during >
the week ha* discouraged speculative ventures j
entirely and news of the day was practically ;
ignored, whether of a favorable or unfavorable !
character. The market again offered sturdy*:
resistance to the depressing influence of the j
war situation abroad, making an effective
rally from the opening decline. But there was
no disposition to follow the advance. While
the readiness of effective support to appear in
face of any attack upon values leaves no op
portunity open for profitable operations on the
short side, there Is an Inclination to sell
' stocks on advances which makes the long side
equally unattractive. The stock market feeling
toward railroad borrowings was expressed tÂ»
â  day in the r>ersistent selling of New York
Central, owing to the prevalent rumors that
that company was issuing notes for means to
continue Its betterment projects. The denials
of the truth of thesÂ« rumors did not help the
stock much, owing to the recent experience
with the Pennsylvania borrowings which were
admitted beforehand. The admission that or
ders for sfitjie 63,000 tons of steel rails had
I been placed on behalf of the Harriman lines
' was accreted cs a favorable factor, the more
j eo as It was believed that the schedule price
was to be paid. But the stocks affected 're
sponded but slightly to the news.
The Brmnefli of Amalgamated Copper, which
vai lifted over a point in the late dealings,
was nominally due to trade conditions and it Is
argued that the outbreak of the war will cut
off the Japanese product from the market, thus
appreciably affecting supplies.
Money was easy and time money rates
yielded slightly. Call money also maintained
Its notable ease. A canvass of the banks shows
that the rn-vemont of currency is still In favor
of New York. In spite of the expectations that
a tem in the tide *as at hand. The market
closed lairly steady near the top, but the
tn<3ing was almost stagnant.
BobZi tvt-re dull, but slightly irregular.
Tntal salep. par value. $1,000,000. United

NEW YORK. Feb. 11.â Bradstreefa to-mor
row will say: Cold wÂ«athcr is still a bar to
expansion in spring trade throughout the West
but signs of life are found In leading Eastern
markets. . The Baltimore fire and the begin
ning of hostilities In the Far East, though af
fecting speculative markets to some- extent,
have not had notable results In jratJp outside
of nectionn Immediately concerned though
come nf the present great strength of price*
of roost commodities may be attributed to the
latter development. Trade and Industrial op
erations betray effects of conservatism some
time ago predicted, but.lt Is yet too early to
measure the possible extent to which tho eea
fon's turnover will contrast with the excep
tionally large business done In all lines one
year ago. Railroad operations, owing to ae
verÂ« weather In January, are resulting In de
creased grosa earning* of the reduced net earn
ings for December. Outside of the division of
some Immediate distributive buslr.et-s from
Uie burned city to other markets, the effects
of the Baltimore flro have. been striking in
contrast with corresponding events In the dis
tant past. Good management of-*the insurance
bueinees Is Illustrated In 'the fact that with
a poEFible loss of $C5.O00,000. no- real embar
rassment In meeting obligations Is expected
and" the restoring of the city normal condi
tions Is making swift progress. Cold weather
prevents outeido activities in building and
limits buying of material. On tho Pacific
Coast trade is improving, and special activity
In war supplies, coal, fodder, dried and canned
flfh and flour is noted. .

displaying most strength.
Tho Iron trado Is Irregular. Other metals

Nczv York Cotton Market.
NEW 'YORK, Feb. 11. â The cotton -market
opened firm at an advance of 21 points to 52
points on covering and moderate bull support
following higher cables than anticipated the
result of a good spot demand at .advancing
prices and rumors that a fresh bull syndicate
had been formed. There was * however no
sign of aggressive buying for long account,
and after, the can -the market ruled quiet
There was a good deal of profit-taking by
yesterday'* buyers, who were not disposed to
carry their holdings over the holiday In view
of the possibility of complications In the Far
East, and during the forenoon there were fre
quent though narrow setbacks, with the mar
ket generally showing an upward tendency
until shortly after midday, when March was
quoted at 13.850. May at 15.09c and July at
14.18c. a net advance of 68@74 points on these
positions.' . This '. level attracted . heavy : offer
ings, but' after a recession of , 8 or -10 point*
the market t-ho wed resistance to a further d.:
cline ruling generally -steady .to firm. Just
before the close - the local bull leader bid for
March, rallying the market-to about the best
for the day. The close was very steady at a
net advance of 35 to 72 points.

I NEW ORLEANS, FebJ. ll.-^-Cotton, to-day
made what would .be . considered sensational
advances in ordinary times, closing prices be
ing 85 to 96 points higher than the close of
yesterday. The market, however, showed little
excitement and the tone throughout was
steady. Tho demand for March contracts Waa
enormous, bids beinc continually made for
from 1000 to 5000 bales. - Offerings were not at
all free and the consequence was that March
made the greatest gain of the day, 99^ pplntfl.

Chicago Board of Trade.
Fnture Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 11.â Initial sales of May
wheat were made at 06c to OX5V4e â prices a
shade higher to %Â®Hc lower than yester
day's closing quotations. July was unchanged
to \\e lower at S7Vic to.S7%c. Several large
commission fiouws and many local holders
were liberar sellers at the. Â»tart, . influenced
by the fact 'that there would' be no session
of the board to-morrowâ Lincoln's birthday.
Fears of .serious developments before, the' re
sumption VÂ»f trade Saturday, caused much even
ing up of fifties. Within the -first hour May
declined to U4%c, while July sold off to 86%c.
Buying on the break,, however, was of equally
as good a character as the previous selling.
Commission houses had -plenty- of orders to
purchase July, and the price' of that' option
soon started upward again. . May followed In
sympathy. News from the j XorthweaT con
tinued of a bullish niture and, the demand for
cash wheat here and at the seaboard wab much
Improved. Toward th* en4Â«*rfwttwÂ».ae*sfon there
was considerable selling of 'both May and July
by the leading bull factors. As a ! rule i many
local traders took the iÂ«elHng side of the mar
ket. An easier tone developed, â  lasting until
the close, May leaving off' at 959iÂ©05%c. July
closed unchanged at 87%c, after reaching 88%c.
Weakness was In evidence in the corn pit
early. - TheVe was heavy selling by the large
bull interests. Late in the day there was
liquidation by holders who did not care - to
carry lines over the holiday, and thin selling
cfyired some reaction. The close, however,
was firm. May-opened a shade to ViÂ®%c lower
at 53%c to M*,c. sold off to 52Hc. and after
advancing to !U%c closed at 63 T /i(B54c. July
showed a gain of \i@%c. closing at I>2%@
02i*c.
The oat market was Influenced to a large
extent by the action of corn, prices showing
moderate losses during the first . hour. The
close was strong, with May %c higher at 4,1cV
after it had ranged between 41'.4@43V4c. July
wan up %c at 30Vic.
The feature in trading In provisions was the
early break In the price of May pork, that
product losing 30c on general liquidation. The
decline was all regained later on an active
commission house demand. Packers were
credited with selling ribs, but the offerings
were all absorbed In buying for Investment ac
count. The close. was steady, with May pork
7%c higher at $14 82H- The range on pork
was between $14 42H@14 85. May lard closed

Holders were still asking high prices, but trade
was of at hand-to-mouth character.; The Ore

'regular^ trade, brought 3612 sacks, a much
smaller quantity than expected. Salinas and

firm at previous prices, receipts being moderate

which were In demand among the Chinese, and
occasional lots of fine large stock sold above
the quotations. â¢ The third car of Western for
the current week was on sale and cleaned up
quickly at good prices. A few straggling lots

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There was no further decrfSe In Butter, but
t.he market was liberally supplied and weak,
with a slow demand and gradually enlarging
stocks â  â 
Cheese Is demoralized, with many sellers
and few buyers, and these exacting conces
sions from the quotations, which sellers, as aÂ»
rule, are only too willing to grant.
Rainy and warmer weather, heavy receipts
and accumulating stocks â¢ made Eggs weak,
and though there was no positive decline close
buyers could shade the quotations. The great
bulk of the business In ranch Eggs was at
25c. and sales at 20c were the exception
rather than the rule. ' -â

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The low prices of. Oranges seemed to attract
trade and there was some little activity In
that fruit during the early morning, but the
market was very dull during tha greater part
of the day owing to the rainy weather. There
was nothing dolns In the shipping line, as all
orders had been filled at the auction sale on
the preceding day. Supplies of the large sires
of Navels while still comparatively light, were
more plentiful than they have been, and It was
difficult to obtain over $2 per box for the very
finest offerings. The other citrus fruits were
dull and unchanged. The Panama steamer

j . Harrison's- circular says: "8lnce the de
[ parture of the steamship Sonoma there has
â¢ been but one delivery of coal from Australian
ports, namely. Bt. Mlrren. with 3200 tons of
coal. There are fire cargoes now afloat bound
for this port, and there are In * all fourteen
cargoes. Including the five now en route en
gaged to transport coal here; the total carry
ing capacity of the fourteen vessels is about
35,000 tons. The quantity of colonial coal
here In yard Is very. light; it consists princi
pally-of coal suitable for house uses; the coal
required for steam purposes Is being - freely
delivered . from the British Columbia collieries
at prices with which the Newcastle collieries
cannot compete ; with, as the freight on coal
from , Newcastle to San Francisco is fully
double what is asked for the same service from
British Columbia, . hence if the colonial mine
owners are solicitous to retain their trade here
locally,- they "will be forced to reduce their
figure* materially below, their present asking
prices. The war between Russia and Japan
now commenced, will not ..In any way affect
the coal trade on this. side so long as no other
nations shall become Involved. Tha output
of fuel oil Is still further Increasing; the
prices remain steady. The Government' trans
ports 1 returning from the Philippines have re
cently been loading coal at Japanese ports, as
they have had* but' little freight, and few
passengers returning here."

DESERTS WOMAN
AT HOTEL DOOR
Frank Graham, Son of Rich New
Yorker, Attempts Suicide at
Occidental, Then Disappears
POLICE SEARCH FOR HIM
Companion He Claims as Wife
Is Prostrated, and Then Con
fesses They Are Not Married
! .After a futile effort to end his life
I with the aid of gas. a recent arrival at
the Occidental Hotel, supposed to be
Frank Graham, son of a wealthy resi
dent of Riverdale. one of the aristo
cratic suburbs of New , York City, yes
[ terday disappeared in' a mysterious
t manner.
I The woman, whom he claimed as his
wife, is now prostrated by nervous ex
citement at the hotel. The police were
called in yesterday to assist her to lo
cate the missing man.
Graham is about 40 years of age, of
robust figure, and is supposed to have
â been drinking heavily of late. In com
pany with a young woman he arrived
j from the north 'on Sunday and regis
' tered at the Occidental as "F. Gray
j and wife, Seattle." En route to this city
i he told several of his traveling com
panions that he was engaged in the
lumber business in the north and was
coming to this city on business. At
times he acted rather peculiarly,^ fact
which was remarked by others on the
train. On Tuesday he and his compan
ion mad* a trip through Chinatown.
Later at night thÂ« woman summoned a
bellboy to her apartments and asked
| him to fetch a doctor, explaining that
j her husband had attempted suicide by
I locking himself in the bathroom and
j turning on the gas. Dr. E. K. John
ston, who resides in the hotel, was
called and after several hours' work, in
which he was assisted by a trained
' nurse, the patient was pronounced out
! of danger, but it was decided to keep
| the patient under the watchful eye of
i a nurse, for he had shown symptoms of
! delirium.
GOES FOR CO1X.
Yesterday morning the guest ap
peared to have fully recovcxed, and
about 10 o"clock he expressed a desire
to go out and cash a draft. Accompa
nied by the woman he was driven in a
hack to the Market-street entrance of
the Palace Hotel, where he alighted,
after telling her that he would be back
as soon as he had secured an indorse
ment to this draft. That is the last his
companion has seen of him. She wait
ed for almost an hour in the carriage
and finally ordered the driver to take
her back to the Occidental, where she
thought her friend might be awaiting
her. .In this hope she was disappoint
ed, and later in the day. apparently
fearing that he might have met with
some mishap, she notified the manage
ment of the hotel, and later the Police
Department.
NOT HIS WIFE.
The woman showed signs of nervous
ness that might naturally be expected
of a wife who had passed through a
similar ordeal, and a great deal of sym
pathy was being extended to her by
other guests of the Occidental, when
she finally made the surprising admis
sion to one of her newly made friends
that she was not married, but had met
her male companion in Seattle arid had
journeyed to this city with him.
It developed Jater that Graham, when
he visited the Palace, went direct to
the office, where he asked for a room,
but his inebriated condition caused his
request to be denied by the clerk. He
then crossed the street to the Grand
Hotel bar. and from there he was
traced to the Lick House, where he en
gaged a room, registering as A. M.
Springer, but later he gave It up. The
last seen or heard of the missing man
was about 2 o'clock, when he turned
over his key to the clerk of the Lick.
The belie/ exists at the Occidental
that the man is temporarily insane
from the effects of excessive drinking,
and that his attempt to commit suicide
was the result of this condition.

yesterday. In respect to constitutional
officers the question is left open,.al
though Justice Van Dyke asserts that
they are not affected by the judgment.
Those who occupy minor positions In
State, county or city governments will
have to-pay their bills if their creditors
so desire.
This is a cruel blow to many who
shape our public policies. It- has all
come about through the successful at
tempt of some bill collectors to slip an
inoffensive looking measure through
the Legislature during the last days of
the session. The bill as passed reads as
follows: â¢
The duly authenticated transcript of a judg
ment for money against a defendant rendered
by any court of this State, may b* filed with
the Controller of the State of California or the
Auditor of any county, city and county, city
or other municipal or public corporation, for
which money is owing 'to the judgment debtor
in such action (and In case t here : be no Au
ditor, then with the officer whose duty corre
t--l>ords to .that of Auditor), whereupon it shall
txÂ» the duty of any such offlcia.1 or of such
public officer with whom such transcript shall
have been filed to draw his warrant in lavor
of or to ray into the court from the docket
of which the transcript was taken so much of
the money, If sufficient there be, over which
such State of California, county, city . and
county, city or other municipal or public cor-
IKiratlcn of which he is an officer, or .over
which such public officer has control or cus
tody, and which belongs to or is owing to the
judgment debtor In the cause designated in
said transcript, as will cancel said Judgment,
the money so raid Into court shall be a dis
charge pro tanto of any amount so due or ow
ing to such Judgment debtor. â¢â >,â¢ â¢
It is alleged that some of the solons
who voted for this bill did not clearly
understand its import until the collect
ors attempted to secure the payment of
debts through its provisions. George E.
Ruperich, an employe in the local de
partment of electricity, was selected to
make the fight against the obnoxious
measure.
/A transcript of a judgment for $98
against him was filed with Auditor
Baehr, who then refused to allow Iiupe
rich's salary demands. The latter pe
titioned for a writ of mandamus to
compel the Auditor to act, and on re
fusal of vthe Judge of the lower court to
issue the desired order appeal was
taken to the Supreme Court.
The last named tribunal holds that
the Legislature has the power to pass
such laws In regard to public officers
over whom it has control. It is stated,
however, that the measure is not a
wise one, in that It furnishes opportu
nity for the "embarrassment of public
officers, who should be allowed to pef
form their duties with as little outside
Interference as is possible.
The petitioner claimed that the law
was special legislation, not uniform in
its operation and that it could not be
applied to officers of the city and coun
ty of San Francisco by reason of con
flict with the charter. The court shows
that none of these arguments are valid
by numerous citations from authorities.
The opinion is written by Justice
Shaw, with whom Justices Angellotti,
Henshaw, McFarland and Lorigan di
rectly concur. Justice Van'Dyke writes
a concurring opinion, in^which he states
that the law does m>t apply to consti
tutional officers. Justice Beatty dis
sents on the ground that as the law is
partly invalid it must be so as a whole.

FIRE WARDENS CAUSTIC
Send Second Reply to Super
visors Regarding Condition of
Hotels and Lodging-Houses
The Supervisors' Fire Committee
yesterday recommended the passage of
an ordinancp. prohibiting any person
from standing In the aisles or passage
ways; of a theater, except in that por
tion known as the foyer. The exception
was made, on motion of Supervisor
Lunstedt; althougft* Chief Sullivan of
the Fire ; Department gave it as his
opinion that no person should be al
lowed to stand In any theater. He said
the Fire Department takes care of the
stage of. a playhouse and the Chief of
Police- should watch the front portion
and see that no one stands during nÂ»
performance." " - . â¢ -
The committee also reported in favor
of the amended ordinance providing
that, all frame buildings sh,all have
exits and glass doors leading to fire es
capes, together with apparatus to
break the doors.
- The Board of Fire Wardens submit
ted a supplementary and somewhat
caustic report, stating that it is im
possible, to comply with the terms of a
resolution requiring a detailed report
of each and every hotel, hospital, lodg
ing-house \ and ': boarding-house. The
first report ..was deemed inadequate by
the committee. In its second report the
Board of Fire. Wardens says:
"The first report' in answer to resolu
tion No. 4314 ; was not 'presumably'
made, but it'was'jma'de at a meeting
after due deliberation, of the board's
members. â¢ The report tells you the
frame buildings referred to were con
structed under previous laws, and no
inspection or reports can alter that
construction and no law can be passed
to alter them. We told you they were
too high and we considered .them dan
gerous in cases of fire. It would take
months of Inspection and thousands of
reports to give a detailed statement of
the conditions of the buildings".
"We advised the extension of the fire
limits, asked for better water supply,
mains, hydrants and a salt water sys
tem and to pass ordinances to stop
such frame construction as is allowed
to-day."-*, ~ .
The committee placed the second re
port on file.
Home Companies Not Shaken.
C. W. Kellogg, Eastern manager of
the Fireman's Fund Insurance Compa
ny, is now In Baltimore settling the
losses of th,at company and of the
Honie -Fire and Marine Insurance Com
pany of California in the recent confla
gration. A telegram received yester
day, at the Home Office from him con
firms his first estimate that the aggre
gate Baltimore loss for the two com
panies will be about a quarter of a mil
lion dollars, and President Dutton ac
cordingly at once wired him as follows:
"Telegram received. Congratulations
at learning that your original estimate
was sulnclentlyiiberal. Remit you one
hundred thousand Immediately, and
more as fast as needed." Make prompt
and liberal settlements, without-, dis
count, realizing that now, in the hour
of their distress, our Baltimore policy
holders are entitled to not only Justice
but liberality at our hands." . .
This conflagration, destroying prac
tically, the entire business portion of a
large city, and costing the two Califor
nia companies each only about one
tenth of its net surplus, which has been
laid aside for just such catastrophes,
should be a great satisfaction to our
people, as indicating the conservative
management of Its two local compa

Applicant Is Required to Pay
All Claims for Damages Re
sulting-From the Operations
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday recommended for passage, a
proposed 1 ordinance introduced by Su
pervisor Connor making it unlawful
for any; person, firm or corporation to
carry 'on the business of rock crushing
without first obtaining from the Board
of Supervisors a permit for the same.
Action was taken as the result of the
board's ! investigation Into the rock
crushing operations of Gray Brothers
at -Thirtieth and Castro streets, when it
was ascertained that there was no law
to compel the securing of a permit for
the maintenance of a rock crusher.
The- ordinance â¢ as recommended by
the Street Committee provides that the
permit must specify tho location of the
proposed rock crusher and the manner
in which the business is to be conduct-,
ed. No permit will be granted, how
ever, unless the applicant therefor
shall file a bond in the sum of not less
than $2500, nor more than 550,000, to be
fixed by the Board of Public Works in
accordance with the estimated value of
the property in the vicinity of the rock
crusher. The bond shall be conditioned
so that the p person receiving the permit
and his sureties shall without delay
adjust and pay any and all damages
which in the judgment of the Board of
Public. Works result from the operation
of "such rock crusher. â¢ .â  . â 
Nothing in the ordinance shall be so
construed as to repeal, amend or in any
sense alter or affect the provisions of
the ordinances specifying the limits
within which rock* crushers are pro
hibited.
The committee reported in favor of
granting the Moody Estate Company a
permit . to construct a spur track on
Seventh street, .between Irwin and

GARNETT MAKES
SUDDEN CHANGE
Withdraws -Motion' for the Ap
pointment of Commission to
Take Deposition of Mrs. Coit
The numerous attempts made* by At
torney W. D. Grady to delay the trial
of Alexander B. Garnett, charged with
the murder of Major J. W. McClung,
came to a sudden termination yester
day afternoon in Judge Lawlor's court.
Two motions were on for argument
one to set aside the information on the
ground of -errors in the transcript of
the testimony taken at the preliminary
examination before Police Judge Fritz,
the other to appoint a commission to
take the deposition of Mrs. Elizabeth
Coit in Xew York.
Judge Fritz and Stenographer Blum
of his court had been notified to give
their testimony on the motion to set
aside the information, but they failed
to attend. When the Judge ascertained
that they had not been regularly sub
penaed he was angry.. He said that
the Assistant District Attorney's ac
tion in not conforming to the regular
process of the court was censurable.
Assistant District Attorney Ferral In
reply contended that the defense had
not made a proper showing, and he
was satisfied to submit the matter with
out any testimony.
Attorney Grady said he would also
submit the case, but asked for sixty
days' postponement to give him an op
portunity to produce Mrs. Coit in court
or have her evidence taken by depo
sition. <
Grady finally withdrew his motion for
a commission to take the deposition.
After some parleying it was decided to
argue the points at Issue on next Wed
nesday afternoon. ?X*
