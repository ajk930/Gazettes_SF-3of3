NEW YORK'S
HIPPODROME
IS OPENED
Largest Place of
Amusement in
the City.
Hundreds of Persons and
Many Animals on Stap
at One Time,
Performance Is Begun With Spectscu
lar Production of "A Yankee
Circus on Mars."
NEW YORK, April 12.â The Hippo
drome, New York's newest and larpest
place of amusement, was opened to the
public to-night under the management
of Thompson & Dundy, and every one
of tho 5200 seats was taken, some of
them having been bought at auction
at high premiums. Wherever there
was standing space it was filled.
The performance was begun with the
spectacular, "A Yankee Circus on
Mars." The first scene showed a
stranded American circus about to Â£c
sold at auction. It was bought by a
Martian, who took it to his planet, and
this gave opportunity in the fallowing
scene to show very elaborate stage set
tings.
Following the circus on Mars came a
spectacular production of American
Civil War incidentsâ â¢Andereonville, a
Story of Wilson's Raiders." In this
there was a battle scene, bringing
numbers of mounted men on the stage.
The great Hippodrome tank was util
ised in the battle scene, the fore part of
the stage sinking, this process of sub
n continuing for several minutes
until the stage represented a river.
With mounted troops represented in
retreat, horses and riders rushed for
ward and plunged into the water,
many feet deep. Many hordes were in
the water at the same time and the
magnitude of the presentation of the
battle made a very effective scene.
The Hippodrome Ftage is remark
ably large, and at times was crowded.
Hundreds of pertspnF and many ani
mals, including elephants and horses.
were in view at one time, making a
very animated and picturesque stage
scene. The circus specialties intro
duced in the first part of the perform
ance were unusually good.
MOUNTAIN
BANDS RAID
AND MURDER
Lawless Conditions
in Part of New
â¢ Hampshire.
Special Dispatch to The Call
BOSTON. April 12.â A startling ex
posure of the dreadful degeneracy and
lawlessness existing in the New Hamp
shire mountain regions at the present
time, with details of outrages that have
been going on unpunished and unpub
lished for years, is being made by a
Boston daily, which has a special cor
respondent in the field.
The conditions in the regionâre
mote towns and villages of the Gran
ite - Mountain Stateâ are almost unbe
lievable and rival the feuds of the Ten
nessee and Kentucky mountains, while
ihe condition of some of the people
is as bad as or worse than the tra
ditional Southern "cracker."
There are several gangs of crimi
nals, among the chief of which is the
so-called "Osipee Mountain gang," to
which have been charged numerous
robberies, assaults, incendiary fires, a
murder or two, and many unspeakable
outrages. These gangs are not all out
laws, some of them living in the set
tled comunities and going about their
ordinary affairs through day and work
ing their criminal wills at night.
L-eagued with them are persns in high
standing who â¦profit in various ways
by their operations. Peaceable resi
dents have been terroized into silence
and this influence has even extended to
the newspapers and to State officials.

New Preferred Stock Issue

Northwest
Social DlÂ«rnt !i to The Cell.
NEW YORK. April 12.â Following
the elimination of MJward H. Harrl
man from the directorate of the North
ern Securities Company, and the prob
able retirement frofn the board of Ja
cob H. Schiff and James StUlm&a, the
only remaining representatives of
I'nion Pacific interests, railroad and
financial circles have placed a new
construction on the proposed author
ization of $100,000,000 in new Union Pa
cific preferred stock.
According to a statement made to
day by a leading railroad authority
it is not improbable that at least a por
tion of the preferred stock issue is to
provide sinews of war for a great rail
road contest for the supremacy of the
Northwest, to be launched by the Har
riman interests against James J. Hill.
There are indications that the funds
will be expended in constructing a net
work of branch lines from the Union
Pacific into Northern Pacific territory.
It is expected that this action would
be met at once by Kill by an invasion
of Union Pacific territory, with exten
sions from the Chicago, Burlington
and Quincy Railroad.
The remainder of the Union Pacific
stock issue is intended to reimburse the
company for sums expended in many
of tho system's recent acquisition?,
such as the San Pedro road, its many
traction properties and small lines to
the Pacific Coast. At least this con
stiuction is placed on the wording of
the statement by the directors, in
which it was said a portion of the issue
was intended to pay for stocks of other
companies. The companies referred to
would thus resolve themselves into
lines already acquired and not pros
pective purchases.
Further developments in this direc
tion are expected after the distribu
tion of Northern Securities assets,
which is scheduled to follow, as soon
as practicable, the issuance of the
mandate by the United States Supreme
Court on Monday.
If the Northwestern railroad war is
to bÂ« precipitated, railroad circles
would not be surprised if Harriman
representatives retired from the direc
torates of other Hill properties. The
Burlington would play a conspicuous
part in the contest. Harriman, Still
man, Schiff and Colonel William P.
Clough are members of its board of
directors.

Charles Merrill
Is Captured at
Milpitas.
Former Conduc
tor False to
Promise.
Charles E. Merrill, star witness
against Publk Works Commissioner
Frank A. Maestretti, under indictment
! for subornation of perjury, was
| broujtt back from Milpitas last night by
i Detective Bolger of the Curtin agency,
! Merrill had played the Grand Jury
\ false and tried to make his escape Horn
j the city. The suspicions of Foreman
j Andrews of the jury v. Kr* aroused On
j Monday and MerriJ- has been closely
I watched since that tim<\ with, the re
sult that he was intercepted before he
had proceeded far.
Merrill was the car conductor who
went to Foren\an Andrews a few weeks
ago and told a sensational tale of how
he was offered $1500 to leave the State.
He boasted of his honesty in spurning
the tempting offer and vowed he would
stand by the jury and give his testi
mony at the trial ot Maestretti. But
an ofter of mure coin or some other
inportant factor must have been
brought to bear on Merrill since that
time, it seems, for he laid his plans
carefully to play the Grand Jury false
at the last moment.
The suspicions of Andrews were
arou&ed when Merrill called on him
last Monday morning and informed him
that he was sick and tired of the city
and wanted to get away to iht- country
for a while. He told Andrews he was
going on a camping trip to Fairfax by
himself and that his wife would be
home. He added that the Grand Jury
could keep in touch with her and in
that way be familiar with his where
abouts.
SAYS HE WAS HOUNDED.
"They have been hounding me to
death," said Merrill. "Men have been
coming to mv house at all hours of
the day and night and trying to get
me to play the jury false. J have got
a leave of absence from the railway
company and 1 am going to Fairfax to
get a rest and dodge tht;se fellows."
Fairfax Wheelan, president of the
Merchants' Association, was present
when Merrill made this statement. An
drews and Wheelan became suspicious
of their man and they notified Detec
tive Bolger of the Curtin agency to
have him watched. A sleuth was set
on Merrill's trail, but he suddenly
dropped out of sight.
The detective went to Merrill's house,
3265 Sacramento street, on Tuesday
morning and discovered that the fur
niture of the place was being moved
out. Inquiry disclosed the fact that
Merrill had sold all his household goods
the day before.
The detective asked Mrs. Merrill where
her husband was and she replied he
had gone across the bay. She did not
know when he would return or what
his mission was. This confirmed the
suspicions of the sleuth and he watched
the woman.
Yesterday morning she took an early
boat to Oakland, accompanied by her
two children, and two detectives from
the Curtin agency were also on board.
The woman got off at Broadway and
there met her husband, who had ar
rived ahead of her on a bicycle. He
had a camping wagon ready for the
woman ajid children.
GIVE CHASE OX BICYCLES.
The detectives secured bicycles and
followed Merrill out the Haywards
road. He drove his team fast and
made excellent time over the highway.
The sleuths kept at a safe distance,
but never lost sight of the wagon.
Shortly after 10 o'clock yesterday
morning the detectives wired Chief
Bolger that Merrill had passed through
Alvarado and was evidently on his way
to San Jose or some other town in the
vicinity. Bolger decided to ko after
the man himself, so he boarded the 2:15
train for San Jose and Intercepted
Merrill at Milpltas as he was passing
through the town.
Merrill was overcome by surprise
â when Bolger confronted him, and did
not realize for several minutes that the
deep game he was playing was known
to the Grand Jury. Bolger informed
him that it was all off and he had bet
ter come back. Merrill readily yielded
to persuasion and came back with
Bolger last night, arriving in this city
at 10:45.
It was a lucky coincidence that Fore
man Andrews of the Grand Jury took
the precaution to have a detective
shadow Merrill, for otherwise the lat
ter would /.' probably ? have . \ made , his
escape : and be. out of reach by the time
that '/,. the .'=; trial eg -Maestretti ',';â¢ came
around. He had "> evidently planned a
long trip, for he .went well prepared. : f

: â¢ That â¢ Merrill; had planned to play the
Grand Jury false â¢â . and .' that \he must |
have been j reached ;â  by j some- of the : on- i
position faction is the theory 5, of An
drews - and " Bolger. He i' told > three-lies
to the foreman of the Grand Jury, so
the i latter/ says, and ; ; tried to/. put him
off the trail in every manner possible,'
so as to ward ? off "suspicion.',-'. â¢Â£.' " -â¢"
In -; the â  - first $ plate. Merrill ; said â }. he
was going ; away *; alone and :i that ;â  his
wife and % family would .'remain â â  in this
city. !>. 4 When & the i; detectives 5 found out
that 'Merrill: had. sold out all his housed
hold effects and ;. was ;; about" to take
his family with him on the trip, : they
lost confidence in the .witness*^ and felt
sure he ; - was ; about ; to ;. give the Grand -
Jury the slip. :; - '-'-.-/r â -'.';'â¢ ''â¢ . --' v
Then Merrill said he was going to
Fairfax. This was also untrue, for
Fairfax lies on the line of the North
Shore Railroad in Marin County and
Merrill was going as fast as his camp
wagon could carry him in the direction
of San Jose, ar.d it is likely that he
would have kept on his journey had he
not been interrupted.
Merrill spoke falsely v\hen he told
Andrews he had secured r leave of ab
sence from the United Railroads. It
was* learned by the detectives that
Merrill had resigned his position sev
eral days ago and since then has been
making preparations to leave the city.
THINK HE WAS REACHED.
That Merrill had been reached by
some one high in power who is work
ing in the interest of Maestretti is be
lieved to be true by Andrews.- Merrill
was a man who liked to accumulate
money and was always anxious and
ambitious to secure as much of the yel
low metal as he could. For that reason,
it is argued, he did not ask for a leave
of absence, from the United Railroads,
for if he had, he would lose his de
posit of $25 which each empleve is
forced to put up as a guarantee to
work steadily till he either quits his
position or Is discharged.
Merrill, as Andrews thinks, would
never have quit his Dosition so ab
ruptly unless he had good reasons for
so doing. He was in the best of health
and sickness never compelled him to
resign. Since quitting his post, he
seemed to have been well supplied with
money.
Merrill's wife undoubtedly knew all
about the plans of her husband,
though she told the detective she was
ignorant of his movements and did "not
know what his plans were. She did her
best to throw the sleuth off the trail
and was evidently satisfied she had
accomplished her purpose when the lat
ter left the house and did not put in
an appearance there again.
Merrill and his wife visited Adolph
Steffens. the convicted stuffer. at the
County Jail on Monday night. They
had a long talk with the latter and
remained at the prison with him for
a long time. It is thought that Mer
rill visited Steffens for the purpose of
telling him what was going on and
perhaps confiding in him his phÂ«ns for
leaving town.
Foreman Andrews will not trust
Merrill agaip. From now on the star
witness will be watched closely and his
every movement reported to the
Grand Jury. He has lost the con
fidence of Andrews and his fellow
jurors and now they are more deter
mined than ever that Merrill must tes
tify against Maestretti.

Special Dispatch to The Call
CHICAGO. April 12.â John W. Gates
reached Chicago this morning on his
way to St. Charle6 to pay his last re
spects to his father, who is dying.
On the Board of Trade some 20,000,
000 or 30,000,000 bushels of wheat
bought for delivery next month were
awaiting Gates' will. Market prices
nervously bounded up and down, prin
cipally up. Still, this did not interfere
with the speculator's one thought to
get to St. Charles and say a last fare
well to the man who gave him life.
Finance shrinks into insignificance
when it meets filial love. That prob
ably is why the trading to-day did not
amount to more than 250,000 bushels.
but during the conversation in the
Grand Jury room he was heard to say,
"Well, I was not trying to run away.
You could have found me any time
you wanted me."
Merrill is practically under arrest.
He was given in charge of one of the
detectives, who had instructions to
stay right by him and not lose sight
of him. The detective will keep guard
over the former conductor till the
trial of Maeatretti is at hand, as the
grand jurors have lost faith in him
and will not give him another chance
to make his escape at the last moment.
Foreman Andrews was reticent re
garding the situation and refused to
make any statement. He was of the
opinion that the arrest of Merrill was
an absolute secret and seemed rather
ruffled when the news of thÂ« arrest
had become public. Andrews said:
"Yes, we have discovered that Mer
rill played us false. You can draw
your own conclusions as to whether
he was offered or received a bribe or
not. It takes money for a man to
make a trip such as Merrill had
planned and he would hardly have
given up his position unless he had a
guarantee of something. He will be
watched fror.i now on, so there is no
chance for his playing Us false again."

Negotiating a Special Com

Germany to Be Given Fa

by Tangier Government
TANGIER, Morocco, April 12.â is
officially confirmed that Dr. yon Kuehl
xnann, who provisionally is acting, as
Charge d' Affaires of the German . lega
tion here, will proceed to Fez at an
early date to arrange a special Ger
man-Moroccan commercial treaty.
American Consul General Philip j ha*
cancelled his projected visit to Fez. â 
BERLIN, April 12.â The new commer
â¢ciai treaty between Germany and .Mo
rocco, which is being negotiated \ by
Dr. yon Kuehlmann, the German
Charge d' Affaires at Fez, is more than
â¢ an arrangement covering \ coasting
trade rights. It embraces all the most
favored nation guarantees in the pre
vious treaty. It is upon this treaty
that Germany will press her resistance
to France's efforts to become the pre
dominating power in Morocco.
LONDON. April 12.â The Tangier
correspondent of the Times learns I on
srood authority that the advisers of the
Sultan of Morocco purpose inviting the
French mission to return from Fez to
Tangier, where the Sultan's definite re-
fusal to accept the proposed reforms
will be officially communicated to the
t French legation. It is believed. . says
* the correspondent, that Germany will
accept the tan's invitation to send
a. mission to Fez to negotiate a new
Â« ommercial treaty and personally dis
cuss , the best means of procuring a
European convention on the Moroccan
Question and international guarantees
of the integrity of Morocco.
PARIS. April* 12.â Germany's efforts
to secure an international conference on
Jthe Moroccan question do not cause
further apprehension here, as the Gov
ernment is aware thai practically all
the powers having any political interest
in. Morocco would not participate.' This
applies to France, Great Britain, Spain;
Italy and Russia, and the other Euro
pean sowers have little or no inter
est in Morocco. Consequently, Ger
many would be practically alone in
favoring or participating in an inter
national gathering.
It is assumed that the neutral,
tude of the United States probably will
lead her to withhold participation, if
all. the Interested parties except. Ger
many declined to take part in : the pro
posed conference. The French-authori
ties, therefore, do not attach further

The resolution recites that the
hours as divided at present have nu
merous objectionable features. The

ing, when the schools are being dis
missed. The 3 to 11 and 11 .to .7.
watches are changed as the theaters
are. closing. The patrolmen on the

early in the morning that they would
sacrifice their rest if they attended
any place of â¢ amusement on the pre
ceding evening. The patrolmen on
the" night watches are either con
cluding or beginning their watches
each night at 11 o'clock, consequently
it is impossible for thsm to attend

of the policemen has been made and
they are all in favor of the contem
plated change of hours.

"'Naif Patterson Is Permit

Prisoner in the Tombs
NEW YORK. April 12. â J. Morgan
Smith and his wife, who were brought
here from Cincinnati yesterday to an
swer a charge of conspiracy with
"San" Patterson to obtain money from
'Caesar' Young, will not plead to the
indictment until next Friday. They
were arraigned in the Court* of Gen
eral Sessions to-day, but, upon request
of their attorney, the case was con
tinued. Judge Foster reduced their
bail to $3000 each.
The continuance was asked for by
the Smiths to permit them an oppor
tunity to examine the minutes of the
Grand Jury which indicted them on
the conspiracy charge. Arraham
Lfevy, counsel for "Nan" "Patterson, re
quested to be heard in the proceed
ings. The court gave Levy one day
in which to notify the District Attor
ney, making the motion returnable to
morrow. At that time arguments will
be made and Mi9s Patterson will be
arraigned on the charge of conspiracy.
Before being taken to the Tombs,
Smith made a statement, in which he
said:
i am very glad to be back in New York. ,'
â  he name of my family has been besmirched. ;
I have not had a chance to clear it, but I
will. My movements on the day the pistol
was bought are very easily traced. I had
written them out, naming every person I met
that day that I knew. My record was in the
trunk which wae conflicted in Cincinnati
and is now In the posselsion of thÂ« District
Attorney. 1 am very grateful for the District
Attorney having It. I did not buy that re
volver, and 1 defy any one to swear or
identify me a* the man.
Hyman Stern, the pawnbroker, who
sold the revolver with which "Caesar'
Young was killed, said before going
into court that he was doubtful if he
could positively identify Smith. After
he had seen Smith, Stern said:
"What I said before about not being
positive goes."
There was an affecting scene when
"Nan" Patterson and her sister met In
the Tombs Prison. When last they
saw each other they occupied an
apartment together in an uptown
hotel. To-day both were prisoners.
Miss Patterson had gained the con
sent of the warden to see Mrs. Smith ;
as soon as she was brought to the
prison. They were left alone, stand
ing with their arms around each
other's shoulders, weeping bitterly.
As the attorneys and several prison
officials stood outside the room, J.
Randolph Patterson, the aged father
of the prisoners, joined the group. He
pleaded with the warden not to sepa
rate the girls.
"If you can grant an old father's
wish." said he. "keep the girls as near
together as you can while they are In
carcerated."
Warden Flynn said he would do all
he could, and has arranged to have
the prisoners on the same tier in the
woman's prison.

CORONER'S JURY FINDS
DEATH WAS ACCIDENTAL
Railroad Men Exonerated in Case of
J. Minis A. Fleming, Who Was
Killed by Electric Car.
SAN JOSE, April 12. â A verdict of
accidental death and exonerating the
railroad from blame was rendered at
the Inquest to-day over the remains
of Lymus A. Fleming, who wac killed
by an electric car near Los Gatos last
night. He was 69 years of ag* and a

He was childish and wandered on the

joining thoroughfares. At 6 a. m.
Policemen Evatt and Esola boarded
the schooners Mizpah and Oriental,
which were ready to sail from Val
lejo-street dock for the Alaska fishing
stations. These vessels carried about
200 Sicilians, who were going to work
at fish catt-hing and canning up north.
The captains lined every man on the
decks, and the officers, after scrutin
izing each face, searched the boats
from stem to stern. The hope of
finding Torturlci was vague, but one
which the police could ill afford, to
east aside lightly.
Chtef Dinan has received word from
Kansas City that the train on which
Torturici was supposed to be was
searched, but no one answering the de
scription of the fugitive was found.
Hourly reports are coming from
country Sheriffs and Constables who
think they have a clew to the where
abouts of the murderer. These are
investigated, but fail to bring out any
new Information. Likewise are re
port* constantly being received by
Captain Burnett from people about
the city who think they have a clew.
Every bit of information that comes
into the hands of the police is inves
tigated, but so far none has proved
of any great valuue.
The reward of 1250 offered by the
Police Department for the arrest and
conviction of Pletro Torturici will be
printed this morning. Chief Dinan
has not yet heard from Governor Par
dee in response to his request that
the State offer a reward of 1500 In

EVENT VIEWED
AS A MIRACLE
ROME. April 12.â An lntÂ«r*Btire cer
emony took place to-day in the Basilica
of St. Agnes, two miies outaid* of
Home. The building stands over the
catacombs, wnere. among others, the
body of St. Agnes is burled. While
Pius IX. on April 12. 1855, was receiv
ing there the Colle- of the Propa
ganda the floor gave way and all pres
ent were precipitated in to the cata
combs twenty feet below. Fortunately
no one was injured, this being by some
persons considered a miracle.
The only survivors of the accident
still living are the Rev. Dr. Richard L.
Burtsell of Rondout, N. V.. and Arch
bishop Rubian, the resident representa
tive of Armenians in Rome. This
morning they were both warmly greet
ed by the assemblage at the BÂ«.Â«ilic*.
Dr. Burtsell celebrated high mass and 1
Bishop Rubian intoned the Te Deum
and bestowed the benediction on the
members ol the College of the Propa
ganda. A number of American stu
dents were present.
The Pope later In the day receivÂ«d
at the Vatican the members of the Col
lege of the Propaganda and also Dr.
Burtsell and Archbishop Rubian. who
were presented by Cardinal Gotti, pre
fect of the propaganda, as the only
survivors of the accident of 1855. The
Pontiff took the occasion to speak of
Plus IX. He said many persons were
urging him to begin the process to
ward his canonization.
'The miracle of the Basilica of St.
Agnes," the Pope continued. "Is one of
thÂ«* events which will be brought for
ward to establish the fact that Pius
IX performed miracles. It Is a good
thing that there are living witnesses to
give their evidence." Continuing, the
Pope delivered a short address <>n
Pius IX.
Dr. Burtsell will leavÂ» Rome on Fri
day and will spend three weeks in
Spain. He will reach the United States
in the middle of May.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 12.â Admiral
George Dewey believes the outcome ot
the war between Russia and Japan
will depend largely on the approach
ing battle between the fleets of Rojest
vensky and Togo. He also thinks the
utility of the battleship has been clear
ly demonstrated. The existing condi
tions, in his opinion, justify the naval
programme arranged by the General
Naval Board, of which he is the head.
"Whether Russia or Japan will be
the victor in the Far East war de
pends, in my opinion, upon the result
of the battle about to occur between
the fleets of Admiral Rojestvensky and
Admiral Togo," said Admiral Dewey.
"If Togo is beaten, all the money and
lives that have been sacrificed by his
country in Manchuria will go for noth
ing. The Russians, in command of
tho pea. would cut off communication
between Japan and the mainland and
the Japanese army in Manchuria
would be powerless.
"Think what Japan would give for
two or three battleships at this critical
moment, when her national safety
would be secure.
"This is a thing we should take to
heart. We have done much in a mili
tary way to protect gurselves. What
we must do now is to complete the
arming of ourselves upon the sea.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1905.
"The programe which the General
Board worked out contemplates the
construction of forty-eight battle
ships â not all in a lump, but two or
three a year. The battleship is the
main thing. All the rest are auxiliaries.
"It has been asserted that it was
the intention of the Navy Department
to keep all these ships in commission
and this would be an expensive opera
tion. Only a part of the fleet would be
kept in commission and others would
be held in reserve. To-day we have
no reserve. Every battleship is in ser
vice or undergoing repairs.
"It is a mistake to believe a bat
tleship would be obsolete in a few
years. Ships of this, type should be
good ships for fifty years to come.
"It has been estimated that a fleet,
of forty-eight battleships would cost
the country annually $200,000,000, but
this estimate was based on the idea
that all the ships would be in commis
sion at the same time. This would not
be the case unless we were engaged in
war. I don't believe our expenses
would be more than $100,000,000 per
annum. The country surely ought not
to begrudge that amount for its pro
tection.

MEYER ENTERS
RUSSIAN COURT
Czar Nicholas Receives the
American Embassador "in
Great and Solemn State"
Washington Government's
Representative Appears in
Simple Evening Dress
ST. PETERSBURG, April 12.â Em
bassador Meyer this afternoon present
od his letters of credence to Emperor
Nicholas at Tsarskoe-Selo. In diplo
matic circles much interest is mani
fested in the first interview between
the Emperor and the new American
Embassador, owing to the widespread
belief that President Roosevelt has al
ready allowed the information to be
conveyed to both belligerents that he
stands ready, upon their mutual re
quest, to undertake the promotion of
peace. It is supposed that Meyer this
afternoon delivered a confidential com
munication to his Majesty from Pres
ident Roosevelt, but so far as is ascer
tained the Emperor did not discuss the
question of peace with the new Em
bassador.
Meyer's reception followed the tra
ditional Old World pomp and ceremony
observed at the court of the Roman
offs. He was received literally "in
great and solemn state." Accompanied
by Secretaries Eddy and Bliss and at
tended by four chamberlains of the
court in full uniform, he traveled by
a special imperial train to Tsarskoe-
At the station the party was
met by Count Hendrickoff, master of
ceremonies and a mwsiber of court of
ficials. Four golden state carriages
were in waiting. The coach occupied
by Embassador Meyer and Baron Korff
was drawn by six white stallions, with
the grooms and footmen in the im
perial scarlet livery and with out
riders on either side. Arriving at
Alexandra Palace, Baron Fredericks,
surrounded by court officials, all on
blazing steods, greeted the party.
Embassador Meyer was first present
ed the Empress' mother, to whom, in
I turn, he presented the embassy secre-
I taries. Then, preceded by Count Hen-
I drickoff, bearing his staff of office, and
; a solemn procession of court function-
I aries, the Embassador passed the sa
1 lons to the Emperor's private apart-
I ments. Here the imperial bodyguard
! saluted. The processiffi halted and the
doors of the private reception room
; were thrown open by the Emperor's
I picturesque turbaned mamelukes, and,
;as the personal representative of the
president, as well as of the Govern
j ment of the United States, Embassa
: dor Meyer advanced alone to meet the
Emperor and Empress.
Their greeting and reception were
! cordial. The letters and credentials
' presented by Meyer were in the usual
form and were addressed "To His Im
perial Majesty, the Autocrat of All the
Russias." The audience lasted ten or
fifteen minutes.
The occasion marked a notable de
parture from the custom of the St.
Petersburg court since the days of
Minister C. P. Breckinridge, Meyer
wearing no uniform, but appearing in
the simple evening dress of an Ameri
can gentleman.
PEASANTS SEIZE ESTATES.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 12. â The

big estates and proceeded to divide it.
Troops have been dispatched to the
scene.
Near Byelostok the peasants de
manded that the landlords cease to
use agricultural machinery, and as
their attitude became threatening
Cossacks were required to disperse
them.
An additional force of Cossacks has
been dispatched 'i to _: Saratoff to quell
the agrarian movement there.

REFORM WAVE
IS SPREADING
Lawyers of the Czar's Em-}
pire Take the Initiative;
in an Ambitious Project
ST. PETERSBURG, April I* 1:11
a, m. â The formation of a national pro
fessional reform league to unite the
activities of lawyers, doctors, teachers,
engineers and other professional classes
of Russia to bring about the democrat
ization of the Government and the in
stitution of representative parliament
and responsible ministry is the ambi
tious project set on foot by the Na
tional Congress of Lawyers, which fin
ished its work here last night. The
plan proposed is the formation of na
tional associations of the various pro
fessional classes, each of which shall
elect delegates to a central bureau,
which is to direct and co-ordinate the
efforts of the "intellectuals" in the di
rection of reforms.
Other classes which have openly man
ifested liberal tendencies on many oc
casions â notably the doctors at their
recent congress in Moscow â are likely
to accept the invitation, and. unless
interfered with, a powerful reform
force is likely to spring Into being
soon.
The deliberations of the* lawyers,
which were carried to a conclusion in
direct disregard of police orders, and
which were particpiated in by 173 dele
gates, representing every judicial dis
trict in Russia, except Siberia, resulted
in tho organization of the National Le
gal Association and the election of a
central bureau of thirteen, which is
empowered to select legal represeata
tives for a proposed central committee
to ydraft preliminary plans for the
organization of that body.
The leaders of the movement declare
that their plans do not contemplate
any assault on the monarchical form of
government or disloyalty to the Em*-

District Attorney Dozier of
Shasta Will Not Accept
a Judicial Appointment
CLINGS TO OLD OFFICE
Declines Honor Tendered as
a Political Eneniy Was
Selected to Succeed Him
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call
REDDING, Cal., April 12.â Thomas
B. Dozier, District Attorney of Shasta
County, who was recently appointed
by the Governor to the new Judgeship
of this county, has refused to resign
his present office to accept the more
remunerative position tendered him.
The reason for this decision is that
Charles H. Braynard, a Redding attor
ney against whom Dozier cherishes
feelings of personal animosity, was
found to have the vacant office clinched
as soon as Dozier stepped down and
out.
Dozier had his resignation drawn up
and ready to flje witn the county clerk
and in fact was preparing to go to
the court house and take the oath of
office when a friend informed him that
Braynard had the pledge of three out
of five of the Supervisors for the ap
pointment. Rather than see his enemy
obtain the District Attorneyship, Doz
ier will refuse the Judgeship and retain
his present office. When these facts be
came known there was great excite
ment on the streets, as each man has
his clan of followers who are willing
to take up his fight.
The political excitement caused by
this turn of affairs caused several fist
fights among prominent politicians, the
most noteworthy being between James
Holt, a wealthy building contractor,
and W. D. Tlllotson, an attorney, well
known throughout Northern Califor
nia, who was former United States
Consul at Yokohama. Holt became so
enraged that it required several men to
drag him from the fight and Tillotson
was taken into his office by friends
and keot there until he had cooled off.

court-martial. He appealed to the
cour* for release on the ground that
there was no war between the two
countries and that therefore the
court-martial had no power to convict
him. The case will be appealed to
the Supreme Court of the United
States.
MORE PENSIONS GRANTED
CONTRARY TO THE LAW
Commissioner Warner Will Require
Money to Be Refunded In
a Hundred Cases.
WASHINGTON, April 12. â Commis
sioner of Pensions Warner has dis
covered that, in addition to granting
pensions under the "old age" order to
members of a Pennsylvania military
regiment, the Pension Bureau has al
lowed about a hundred claims on ap
plications made prior to April 13,
1904, the date on which the order
went into effect. The Commissioner
will require that the money be ' re
funded. He says that in this matter
the mistake was due to error in the
construction of the laws.

I WEEKLY CALL TEARVOICES AND STAGE SETTINGS GIVE
SUPREMACY TO "LA GIOCONDA"
Opera Produced as
Never Before in
This City.
"Dance of Hours"
Great Scenic
Feature.
BLANCHE PARTING TON
They did in tAg "what last Saturday
afternoon they did in little with the
cae-act TPagUacd" with "La Gio
taaioa.- last night at the Grand Opera
house. Modestly the management has
hScted at a sensation In productions
with, the Poachielll opera. The pre
diction was glltteringly fulfilled last
night- In fact. for the first time the
opera has been really heard here. Like
seme beautiful ' women "La Gioconda'
demands lavish adornment, demands
the jeweled setting, demands the ut
most splendor of surroundings. Then,
too, for its proper performance it de
mands -. cast that only a Maecenas
*.raoi:p- managers will afford. These it
had last evening in the superlative, and
.Mr. Ponchielli's opera in consequence
Slitters up into one of the gems of the
season.'
One had felt the opera before almost
a "Les Huguenots" in its ponderous
and turgid t-plendor without, too, some
of th^t opera's most melodious raisons
d'eLres. Under the mettlesome baton
of V igaa and with the dramatic verve
and vocaJ glory brought to it by every
member of the cast, the opera devel
oped a plc-t seeable without a telescope;
and a vivid dramatic and musical
movement that swung through tri
umphantly from beginning to end. The
settings were admirably illuminative.
Venice, the courtyard of the Doge's
pa bice, pictured iii the first act, with
its splendidly garbed people, set one
handsomely and at once in key â with the
Ik riod. The scenic illusion of the sec
end act could not be bettered.
It had. with its misted moonlit sea, a
silvered gondola floating by. the for
est of lazy, hazy ships and . a dim
shrine with its little, nickering lamp,
much of the vague, clinging charm
evoked by De Maupassant's "Moon
light" Nor could one ask a richer pic
ture than thrt of the final tableau of
the third act, Badoero's "Marble Bells,"
the cobles in slashed velvets and silks
payly crowding the foreground, and in
the background the sheeted figure of
Liaura, watched over by the pale, tall
tapers. No care, nor expense, no-lir
tistry that could be gathered into the
service has been spared all the way
through. And, still to speak of the.as
sistant detail, the ballets are the best.
not excepting even those of "Tann-Â»
hauser." that have been brought here.
La. Scala. might do more, but not
more exquisitely, with the "Dance of
the Hours." than the Metropolitan
Company did last night- The "dance"
itself we know to its last tinkle." But
with t.he illuminative symbolism' fur
nished by the dancers it was a new
thing. Six maidens, rosy with the
dawn, first appear, bearing the flow
ers of the morning. Then comes an
other six. golden in the full flush 'of
noon and overshadowing the pearly
daughters of the dawn. After these
of course comes the twilight six, in
cool grays and purples, lulling the day
to sleep. Six more shrouded in the
starred blue of the night come then.
The night conquers. Dawn, noon and
evening sink under its shadows one by
one. But dawn lifts again and day and
night, evening and noon, melt together
in a swirl of lovely color and form. A
charming bit of symbolism, beautifully
carried out. There is another ballet,
of pantalon. columbine and harlequin.
that but *for the later one of the
'Hours" would be prominent in one's
memory.
The castâ only Caruso and Nordica,
Eeotti an.i Homer., and a few others al
most such. Perhaps it was Xordica's
n?Â£ht last night, and one grieves to.
learn her last of nights here only Sat
urday evening for aM time. The man
apement : rr>res that on Saturday
Tiight we shall hear the last of this
famous American sinser. If this be
actualiy so.- it -Will b-Â» the first CRse
within one's acquaintance of a singer
retiring at the very 1 1 â >: of her powers.
One har, wished that such might be the
c?s<? just once, for the S2ke of a single
radiant memory. Yet, tooth and nail,
one fiphts against the possibility. But
if si it be. with her Gfocqnda of last
nieht in evidence, Xordica. will retire
in t??<Â» full blaze of her glory. One
vished for more roles In Italian opera
like- that, of La Gioconda last night, in
order to .give chance to hear Nordica in
therr. -
To the role Rhe brings all the intense
drair.atic fiber of her Brunnhilde, with
a plasticity, a litrhlr.ess of handling of
which wiih NordScaJnne rarely receives
tokÂ«n. The delicacy, of the vocal treat
ment in her little scene with Laura,
where '- she brings the. sleeping potion,
as well as the suppleness of the acting.

was of the surprising delights of the
interpretation.
In the heroic moments the prima
donna was of course splendidly suffi
cient, as usual, and, moreover, gave an
uncommonly convincing and ungrand
operatic picture of the. street girl. Her
scene with L.aura by the sea was lovely
in the extremeâ lt should not be , for
gotten that Homer at her best added
greatly here. â  Hut it v.as a triumph of
Nordic* all through, one of the hundred
laureled days that have been hers here.
They did bring on a wreath of bay for
her last nightâ an incongruous .and
sheepish gentleman in "the tubular
black garb of the dayâ an unpardon
able anachronism,' Mr.. Conried.
Place aux dames. Btill to gay that
Honv-r. M s I>aura, hap never been seen
or heard to better advantage here. She
has taken off a score or so of pounds of
flesh since she was here last and put it
all on again in distinction and poise.
Her voice â still a little throaty â is of
plushlike richness, and has gained
notably in d^pth and smoothness. Miss
Homer, too, got a distinctly tragic note
and throughout was admirably con
vincing in her acting as Badoero's wife.
It would not be Miss Homer, either,
with a oeautiful picture rising to the
eye at the name, and in her broidered
purple velvet last night the contralto
was her most lovely self.
Mme. Jacoby, not v^ry well, one
hears, was the' third American woman
to win laurei? last night. Mme. Jacoby
gave a very sympathetic and very well
pung interpretation of the blind moth
er's part. The voice develops as a true
and fine ccntralto, not so rich as
Homer's but of the same valuable fiber,
and her acting lent true pathos and
dignity to the character.
Caruso charmed again in the fashion
that has become history here. Some one
said that Whistler (it was George
Moi.-re if my memory serves me) given
twenty pounds more would have been
a Velasquez. / One wonders if it is
that slight erâ roundness that makes an
Israfel out of Caruso. It is a voice
that suggests the oil and corn and
wine, suggests the milk and honey of
the Promised Land, suggests all things
golden, sweet and wonderful. He has
the "Clelo c Mar." as chief titbit of the
6core. One simply throws up ong's
hands before its beauty, turns helpless
eyes ui> to heaven. Caruso satisfies one
to the very core of one's musical mar
row. In the light passages his voice
dips into tone as lightly as a bird
skimming and touching the sea. In the
heavier passages it has the clang and
ring and fury of a full chime of bells.
Anything he can do with his voice.
This only one can say, he sings of
God
The part of Grimaldi affords Mr. Ca
ruso good acting opportunitiesâ but
there Is still his lanio In front of it.
However, one may be content to hear
his lenzo. It will not be any trial to
sit to it. And Mr. Caruso does every
thing for the part dramatically that
can be done.
Scotti has the acting role of the opera
in the spy Barnaba. Mr. Scotti has not
yet quite recovered his vocal tone, but
sang gloriously Just the same. To the
role he brought all the grip, pulse,
vigor and subtlety that it demands, and

throughout shared the lavish honors
of thf evening. Mr. Journet was an
excellent Badoero. impressive, noble,
and vocally valuable.
The chorus also took active part in
the success of the performance, the
choruses going with an elan, precision
and smoothness altogether satisfying.
Mr. Vijrna and thÂ° orchestra â well.
they werp Mr. ViÂ£na and the Metro
politan orchestra. Enough said.
AIDIKXCE ENTHUSIASTIC.
Another great audience crowded the
Grand Opera-house last night. From
the proscenium boxes the view of the
magnificent audience was a picture of
rare beauty. White seemed to be the
favorite shade for the fair sex and
that color predominated. The boxes
were all filled with lovely women in
magnificent gowns. Jewels sparkled
from Bwanilke necks and blazed in
brilliant tiaras.
Applause and recalls were the or
der of the evening. Everybody took
a hand in applauding the great artists.
The onthuEiasm was general from the
front row of the orchestra to the last
row of the top floor.
In the foyer between the acts a
general handshaking took place.
Kv**rybody was congratulating himsflf
ami his rreighbor that he and she were
th^re. So such another lively and
enthusiastic atmosphere hss pervaded
the great marble hallway since this
6eason of brilliant opera , began.
Everybody liked the music of the
opera, and they liked the great artist 3
who interpreted it. There was but one
sentiment and that was of delight.
The opgra and its splendid rendition
struck a great sympathetic chord and
no more delighted audience ever sat
within the walls of the Grand Opera
house.
'La Gioconda" will be repeated for
the farewell performance of the sea
son on Saturday night.

"PARSIFAL" FOR IiAST TIME.
The third and only matinee per
formance of "Parsifal" will be given
to-day. The curtain will rise on the
DISAGREE WITH
THE PRESIDENT
WASHINGTON. April 12.âAmend
ments to their constitution. Increasing
representation In the annual executive
session as well as in the triennial ses
sion, were adopted by the National
Council of Women in triennial session
to-day. Miss Susan B. Anthony was
designated founder of the Interna
tional and National Council of Women.
A defense of wur was made by Mrs.
Belinda S. Bailey of California.
"Ihere is," she said, "a growing sen
timent against war. Yet, horrible as
war appears in some of its aspects, all
Us flowers are not red." She spoke of
the American wars from 1776 down,
and paid all had been waged in the
interests of civilization and progress.
In a quiet way the observations of
President Roosevelt on the question
of race suicide are receiving the at
tention of some of the prominent del
egates. Some of them take issue with
the President on this subject and say
he should look to the women of his
own social set for race suicide.
â¢'The women of the middle classes
and the women of the 'submerged
half," as we call it, do not practice
race suicide," ' said one of the dele
gates.
To-morrow a resolution will be re
ported on the question of parenthood,
which, it is said, will take issue with
the President's views on the question
or race suicide and will declare that
"quality, not quantity." in children is
to be desired.
To-night Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,
president of the National Woman's Suf
frage Association, made an address In
which she openly spoke her mind on
the question of parenthood, saying in
part:
It is said' thfit women should rear more chil
dren, but I say that you must flrat make your
country fit to roar children in. We neÂ«d to
make this world safe for children. To do so
we must irivc them social heredity, so that
th^y will be born in cafe conditions and pro
tected until grown. This cannot be done un
til women have rights in the State to pro
tect them. We must have city mothers as
well as city fathers. We desire the suffrage
as a means to an end.
first act at 11:30 a. m. At 1:15 p. m .,
at which time the first act will end.
there \\|ill be an intermission until
2:30 p. m.. when the final acts of the
opera will be given.
The cast will be the same as on
Tuesday. Fremstad, who scored such
a tremendous triumph, will sing Kun- 1
dry. and Burgstaller will do Parsifal.
The house will be undoubtedly packed
to its utmost capacity and will proba
bly equal the great audience of Tues
day night. Nearly every seat is al
ready taken, but those who come ear
ly this morning will have a chance of
getting some of the few remaining
seats not yet sold.
SEQUOIA CLUB
TO MOVE INTO
ITS NEW HOME
SALLY SHARP
San Francisco is fast becoming a city
of clubs.
It holds clubs for men and clubs for
women, some forty of them.
And since September, 04. it has held
a club for botn men anu women â an
organism and a rendevous thai the
gentle Knocker predicted could not live
â and tor the very vital reason that
women weren't born clubable.
For nearly a year, the clvb â the
Sequoia â held headquarters in the St.
Francis, where on Tuesday evenings it
held informal "at homes. ' These, for
the most part, were delightful affairs,
many interesting men and women
gathering together to swap storiesâ
and sip punch.
And besides, when big people came
amongst us, the club put on its dress
suit and entertained them in a pretty,
modest way that caused many nice
things to be said of the club and of its
personnel.
Betwixt times, several artist members
of the club held exhibitions in the club
rooms, and many a nice little cud of tea
was sipped of afternoons after a shop
ping skirmish.
Then the club outgrew Its quarters
and moved to the Palace, where it hunc
out the latchstrlng to such as loved
the camaraderie of the Sequoia.
And now, hehold the club that the
Knockers predicted would die a prema
ture death â die of petticoatitis â is en
tering into its own home on Sutter
street, near Mason, where, at its own
glowing hearthstone, it will radiate
good cheer "'to all who enter here. 1 '
And thus will the 25th day of
April (Easter Tuesday) be a day of
glad rejoicing, for on thai, day will salt
be spilled upon the doorstep, the house
hold gods be toasted with red, red wine.
and the quarters taken in the name of
the Sequoia â and goodfellowship and
blessings on both!
In the evening a reception will be
held, and an exhibition of some artist
members of the club may form a motif.
But of course, the \ ital interest will
center in the appointments of the new
club-home.
And herein does the club stand alone.
In the seven rooms of the nt\v home
there's not a chair, a table, a tabouret,
a picture or a picture frame that ia
not the handiwork of, a club member.
Now, isn't that a thing to be proud
of? You can't say until you see them?
âthat's true, but when you do. you'll
declare them ideals of simplicity and
elegance â in perfect ecr-ord with the
club's personality and purposes.
On the other side of the building.
known as the Lloyd, is the French
Club.
Now, a fine spirit of neighborliness
exists twixt the two clubs â who us?
front stairs in common. To be
Sure, housewives in fiats, with stairs
in common, ofttimes go to war over
who shall clean them.
It is believed that the ethics herein
involved has been solved by the boards
of directors of the respective clubs.
There is in prospect a Joint bowling
alley and many other interesting
phases of club fun.
To be sure, these achievements have
meant much work for the directors.
But what of that, so long as the
Knocker lost his quarry?
Count Yon Schmidt of Los Angeles
entertained a supper party at the
Palace last night, entertaining Mrs.
Lydla Burrage of Paris. Mr?. Isabella
Whitney. Dr. and Mrs. Loefler of New
Orleans, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Schmidt
of New Orleans.
Miss Elizabeth J. Gunn yesterday be
came the bride of Lyman I. Jlowry, the
well-known Federal court lawyer. The
wedding came as a surprise to their
friends, who received the first intima
tion of the matrimonial step when the
groom applied for a license.
The happy pair have gone to South
ern California for a short wedding
trip.
The French Club of the University
of California will give a dramatic even
ing on Friday, April 14, at S o'clock ia
Hearst Hall. It will consist of two
plays. First. "Gringoire. " a comedy of
Theodore de Banville, in which King
Louis XI marries a young heiress to
a Bohemian poet: second, "Le Premier
Mai." a pastorale comedy with old
French songs, dances and choruses.
Tlm latter was composed by Robert
Dupouey. instructor at the university,
and directed by Mrs. Frederic Ernest
Farrington.
Those desiring to attend the French
evening will find it convenient to take
the 7 o'clock Key route from San Fran

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
MURDER STALKS
IN BOY'S MIND
Arthur Rowe Conceives Plans
to Slaughter Family.
Keeps Them in Fear of Death
and Law's Aid Is Asked.
OAKLAND, April 11â Arthur Ftowe.
14 years old, who has kept his family
in a state of terror for months by mur
derous threats and actions, has been
* certified to the Juvenile Court, after
an examination by Police Judge Morti
mer Smith, which disclosed astounding
mental depravity in the boy. George
Rowe, the youth's father, residing at
1558 Eleventh avenue, gave further, tes
timony to-day in court concerning the
boy's conduct, which is strangely vio
lent.-
At dead of night, according to the
parent, his son would conoelve awful
echemef of murder, the father, the
moth"! and little brothers to be vic
tims. Rowe testified that two weeks
ago the boy ground up a lot of matches
which he dropped into coffee, poisoning
the entire family, who were made se
riously ill. One night last week the
boy slashed his sister's hand with a
knife and tried to torture a sister and
a brother by setting fire to their hands
and feet.
8 "Two weeks ago," continued Rowe,
"the boy threw an ax at me, and
missed my , head by not a hair's
breadth. The blow would have killed
me if the weapon had struck its tar
get. With his mother and other mem
bers of the family the boy has been
as violent. We .cannot explain the case.
He- does not seem to be insane In the
ordinary sense of the word, but at
times is seized with what* appears to
be an uncontrollable desire to commit
murder. Matters reached such a pass
that we could do nothing more to try
to restrain the boy."
The authorities will place Arthur
where his case can be watched, studied
and given expert attention.
FREE LICENSE
GRAFT CHECKED
OAKLAND, April 12 âCity Treasurer
CharieÃ D. Batee Jr. and Mayor F. K.
Molt have united to suppress the free
license nuisance, which has grown to
intolerable proportions. Applicants for
free licenses to sell merchandise in
competition with established shopkeep
er* are to be hemmed in by rules and
regulations which, the city officials
think, will correct what they declare
has been a greatly abused privilege.
Hereafter an applicant must be an
American citizen, resident of Oakland
at least two years, of good habits, head
of a family and without police record,
before his petition will be considered.
Besides he will have to be physically
infirm or maimed and incapable of
earning a livelihood by ordinary
means.
The investigation of recent appli
cants for the free license certificate
has uncovered cases where the peti
tioner has not resided more than three
months in the United States. It has
been such disclosures that have in
duced the more drastic methods of
handling the bureau.

and Effect?. ' Miss Brownsill. who has
been conected with the Chinese mis
sion, displayed profound erudition,
and her thorough acquaintance with
her subject and the masterly way in
w hlch she handled it roused much ad
miration, which extended even to the
members of the faculty who were
present. After a lengthy review of
our relations with China, past and

tionally interesting. Miss Brownsill ar
rived at a conclusion deprecatory of
unrestricted immigration of and iiiter

raoÂ«e.
The course now adopted by the
Government toward the Orientaf races
she believe* to be more conducive to
attaining their friendship and confi
dence than the more forceful policy
formerly in vogue, and she maintains
that the reparation due from this
country for former wrongs is in fair
process of accomplishment, justice be
ing tempered with kindness and stern
enforcement of th*> law with consid
eration for those affected.

KATE WIGGIN
DAY AT THE
OAKLAND CLUB
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND. â Xpril 12.â The problem of.Juit
how much of a good thing: Is enough Is- an
old one. and one that few women ha-â¢- solved,
v.'hen club women learn to curtail their pro
rramroes to reasonable lengths, they will have
-made a notable stride in the . march of pro
gress. Club entertainments, as 1 a rule are
merely pleasant' excuses to bring the members
twiner and the most . enjoyable part of the
meeting is really the few moment* 1 , visit over
the teacup, at the close of the afternoon.
To-dayâ Kate Wiggln dayâ at the Oakland
Club was of more -than ordinary Interest to
the hundred or -more women present, not only
on account of the authoress's popularity but
because her life and Interests have been so
closely identified with California affairs. One
might say she began the â  kindergarten ' work
now so successfully conducted on this coast, for
It was she who adapted the Froebtl system to
the needs of restless American children.
A brief sketch of her work and personality
was given by Mrs. Frame* Gray,, who knew
Mrs. Wiggln well, and then extracts were read
by Mrs. Reamer from "Rebecca of Sunny
brook Farm." Between the readings scenes
from the hook were enacted by Miss Lillian
Swale as Rebecca, Mrs. -E. F. - Cold as' Aunt
Miranda, Mrs. Martin Brtgman as Aunt Jane,
Austin Oegood a* -Mr. Cobb and also as
Mr. Ladd. This clever quartet showed !n their
work not only complete understanding of the
various characters, but considerable â  histrionic
ability. The club was quite prepared for ex
cellence from Miss Swales,,- having already
had examples of her ability, 4 but Mrs. Oole
and Mr*. Bridgman were surprisingly good. -
The old-fashioned sonjrs that Interspersed the
readings were. very sweetly sung .- by Mrs.
lyucien Lanrw-orthy. . '
I must not frorget to mention the little
kindergarten people from West Oakland, who.
under supervision of Mlsr Winnie McFarlanu.
sang a number of playtime nongs before the
real programme began. There were ten or
twelve tots of every shade, from the little
eb^ny four-year old chap to a Dale golden
haired little girl irt nlnk and white. Small
white hands clasped black ones with ni
thought of caste, and who runs might read the
(rlarlng irtory of equality as taught In our
public schools. The little tykes were well
drilled In their songs and evolutions and were
happily Interested In everything.

GIRL'S SANITY
IN QUESTION
Dr. Selfridge Swears That
He Believes Miss Alice
Courtwright's Mind Sound
COOT HEARING CASE
Young Woman Says Fath
er and Her Brother-in-
Law Drove Her From Them
OAKLAND, April 12.â The attempt
by her family to have Miss Alice B.
Courtwright, daughter of an aged re
tired minister, sent to an insane asy
lum, promises to precipitate a big fam
ily row and an ugly household skeleton
may be dragged out into the light of
day. Miss Courtwright has retained
Attorney H. G. Walker and is pre
pared to fight the insanity proceedings.
She states that she has been forced
to leave the home of her father, Rev.
W. C. Courtwrlght, and that of her
brother-in-law, Thomas Glenn, on ac
count of their actions toward her.
Dr. Clarence Selfridge testified this
morning when the proceedings began
that he had visited Miss Courtwright
at the detention ward a number of
times and could find no indication of
Insanity. He states that she is suffer
ing from nervous indigestion.
Thomas Glenn testified that his sis
ter-in-law had behaved strangely
while at his home and that his wife
had sworn to the complaint. Being a
druggist he had prescribed the cold
water cure for her and also given her
a massage treatment.
With the hearing of these two wit
nesses, the case was continued until
to-morrow morning, when Miss Court
wright will make a statement in her
own behalf.
CHINESE YOUTH
AS SUB-EDITOR
BERKELEY, April 12.â A novelty in
the university's annual Blue and Gold,
to be prepared by the 1907 class, is an
nounced by Editor in Chief Gabbert in
the form of an Oriental department,
with a Chinese student in full charge
of that portion of the annual.
S. Y. L. Jee, a sophomore, whose rec
ord for scholarship is said to be excel
lent, was chosen by Editor Gabbert,
after a careful consideration of the
score or more of men from the Orient
who are now receiving instruction at
the State University. Jee has perfect
command of the English tongue, is a
fluent speaker and writes with ease
and clearness. He is regarded as fully
qualified to give the Blue and Gold a
creditable department dealing With
Oriental affairs.
Jee is expected to describe, in detail,
for the Blue and Gold the various
steps that have been taken by Oriental
countries to send their young men to
America for instruction, and how the
influx has increased until the Oriental
contingent now at the university is an
appreciable part of the student body
deserving of serious consideration in
the representtaive publication of the
colleges.
Jee bf-lleves that he has a fund of
picturesque material, including plc
nirep and other features with which
to make his department in t the Blue
and r;r.)d a ? interesting as any between
the covers of the big: book, and already
has begun to delve for rare photo
graphs and other Chinese, Japanese
and Filipino inpigna that will later be
reoroduced for the students' publica
tion.
He will seek the aid of Professor
Fryer, head of the department of
Oriental languages, in preparing the
material for his department in the
Blue and Gold, the professor always
having manifested a deep interest in
the welfare of the Oriental contingent
at the university, and being now en
gaged in founding a special prepara
tory school for them In the vicinity of
the university.

CARNEGIE'S GOLD
FOR COLLEGES
Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
GRINNELL, lowa, April 12.â The
first authetic statement Of the plan of
Andrew Carnegie for the distribution
of a large sum of money to all colleges
throughout the West has been made
on information from President Daniel
of the Bradley-of-lowa College.
President Bradley and President Mc
1 Clellan of Knox College at Galesburg
were deputed to prepare for submis
sion to Carnegie a plan by which he
could distribute a number of millions
among the smaller colleges. Carnegie
had considered for two years requests
aggregating five millions from Congre
; gational colleges at Beloit. Wls.;
; Galesburg. 111.; Grinnell, Iowa; Colo
rado Springs, Colo., and declined to do-
I nate in this way, but asked that a com-
I mittee of college presidents prepare for
I him a comprehensive plan by which the
institutions might be helped in ac
cordance with their merits and needs.
The result is the proposal which has
recently been laid before the iron-
I master. It looks to the distribution of
$12,500,000 among fifty colleges in seven
teen States. It Is understood they are
all west of New York. The money is
i not asked for in equal amounts, though
I no allotment departs very far from the
j average of a quarter of a million.
It is expected Carnegie will consider
ably modify the plan. He wants a re
quirement that each college shall raise
an equal amount from other sources.
One of the first fruits of the clean
heart will be clean hands.
OFFICERS LOSE
COVETED CAPS
Captain Nance Punishes Men
at University Who Failed
to Keep Order in Ranks
SEQUEL TO CAMPUS RIOT
Bulletin Issued Announcing
Fall From High Places
of Company Commanders
BERKELEY. April 12.â Captain J. T.
Nance, military instructor at the State
University, dropped a dynamite car
tridge in the ranks of the cadets who
drill under him, when he Issued, late
this afternoon, an official bulletin an
nouncing the derating of the officers
of Company E, First Regiment of the
University cadets, and transferring
various privates to other companies.
Not in the history of the institution
has a military instructor found it ne
cessary to thus punish refractory pu
pils, and the disgrace attending the
loss by company officers of their caps,
gold braid and epaulets is keenly felt
by the men marked for discipline.
There is no redress for them. Captain
Nance's bulletin makes it plain that he
has acted with the approval of Presi
dent Wheeler.
The order as posted in the military
department to-day reads as follows:
With the approval of the President, the fol
lowing officers and non-commissioned officers.
Company E. First Regiment, are reduced to
the grade of private, viz:
F. N. Baker, second lleuianant; C. U. Smith
aid G. A. Wltte, sergeants; M. E. LÂ«ach, K.
T. Rosenlund, F. O. Slevera. R H. Van riant.
D. G. Whitelaw and T. W. Wlnsor. corporals.
With the approval of the President, the fol
lowing named privntes, Company E, First
Hegrimeni, are transferred to other companies,
First Regiment, as Indicated opposite their
names: J. H. \V. Barms, A. T. Howe and
H. W. Ixisse, to Company B; C. H. McCharles,
C K. McKilllcan. H. R. Mead. G. D. Hock,
J. C. O'Connor and L. R. Rt-ed. to i*ompany C;
E. A. Richards, to Company A; R. J. Wulzen,
to Company D.
No announcement has been made by
Captain Nance regarding the names of
the officers who will be appointed to
take the places of the derated men.
Captain Nance alsb refuses to discuss
the bulletin he has given out.
The derating of the officers, how
ever, Is known to be a sequel to the
riot In Company E during drill hours
two weeks ago, and is deemed to be
significant of the policy that is to pÂ»e
vail during Captain Nance's tenure of
office as military instructor, a policy
that includes the preservation of dis
cipline and the placing of his depart
ment on a sound military footing.
Captain Nance was horrified a fort
night ago when he unexpectedly ap
peared oh the scene during an exhibi
tion of cat-calling and rioting by the
men of Company E. and at once called
upon the officers of the company for
the names of all the defenders. The
officers hesitated, declaring finally that
they could not provide Captain Nance
with the names of the guilty cadets.
That was a confession of their Ina
bility to preserve discipline, according
to Captain Nance, and he proceeded to
probe the matter to the bottom. He
confined the offending company in the
armory at the next drill hour, told
them how their conduct failed to re
semble that of soldiers or officers and
again called for the names of offend
ers during the miniature riot of a few
days before. Again he failed to get
the information. There the matter was
allowed to rest, supposedly, and the
officers and privates who had been on
the inquisitorial rack breathed easier.
To-day the surprise for them came in
the form of Captain Nance's announce
ment of the loss of their positions, with
the honors and merits accompanying
the places, and the shift of various pri
vates, supposed to have been among
the rioters, to other companies under
officers that are expected to keep the
refractory cadets In lii\e.
ORDER BLACKS
TO LEAVE TOWN
COFFEYVILLE, Kans., April 12.â A
race war has narrowly been averted
here as the result of the assault by a
negro upon Mrs. John .Griffith, white,
the wife of a machinist, and serious
trouble la still likely. Negroes of the
worst class have been ordered to leave
town before night.
In anticipation of a clash between
the two races the Mayor to-day issued
a proclamation ordering that all cit
izens disarm, and at the same time
many special officers were sworn in.
Since the negro's attack upon Mrs.
Griffith fellow negroes have been arm-
Ing to prevent the lynching of any in
nocent negro, as seemed likely, and
early to-day an attempt to disarm a
number of blacks resulted In a dozen
revolvers being leveled at Chief of Po
lice Smith's head. Other negroes rushed
to the scene, but a body of whites stop
ped them with leveled rifles. The leader
among the negroes was choked into in
sensibility and the others were sub
dued.
The negro who assaulted Mrs. Grif
fith is still at large.

ASIATIC LABOR
FOR THE CANAL
WASHINGTON, April 12.â Chairman
Shonts, Governor Magoon and Chief En
gineer Wallace of the Canal Commis
sion met in Secretary Taft's office to
day. It was the first meeting of the
executive committee of the Isthmian
Canal Commission and the details of
the organization were considered.
On the whole the commission had a
long and satistactory discussion with
Secretary Taft and reached some con
clusions as to the organization of thÂ«
Panama Railroad directorate at the
meeting which is to take place next
Monday in New York. Chairmaji
Shonts of the Canal Commission will be
the next president of the Panama Rail
road Company and every member of
the commission will be made a director
of the road. That will leave four mem
bers of the directorate to be named and
they will be civilians.
The labor problem was discussed at
length and it was resolved that con
tracts should be made for the employ
ment of 2000 Japanese and 2000 Chinese
coolies In the canal construction. This
Is merely a preliminary and experimen
tal move, but if it succeeds the engi
neers will have an almost unlimited
force of labor to draw on.
An interesting feature of the discus
sion tn-day was a statement by Engi
neer Wallace to the effect that it is en
tirely feasible to construct either a
tide-level or lock canal across the isth
mus, though he himself strongly favors
the tide-level project.
XO I/ONGER APOSTOLIC
DELEGATE TO CUBA
An-hbishop Chapelle to Be Succeed-
Ed in Vntiiles by a Prelate
of the Curia.
HAVANA. April -12.â According to
news received here, Monsignor Cha
pelle, the Archbishop of New Orleans,
has been definitely relieved from the
office of Apostolic Delegate In Cuba.
It seems that after Monsignor
Chapelle was in Rome last winter it
was decided at the Vatican that he
should give up jurisdiction in the An
tilles, but, once in America, he wrote
to the Holy See asking that this meas
ure be postponed. The Vatican, how
ever, to put an end to the troubles
arising from the accusations of a per
sonal character against the Arch
bishop, has now confirmed Its deci
sion.
So Monsignor Chapelle will not re
turn to Cuba, and, according to what
has been learned here from Rome, it
appears that he will be succeeded by
a prelate of the Curia, that is, one
now employed at the Vatican.

moval of Justice Warren B. H
from the Supreme Court bench of
New York by a concurrent resolu
tion of the Senate and Assembly was
recommended in an argument to-day
by former Deputy Attorney General
Henry B. Coman, counsel for the com
mittee of Inquiry.
John P. Stanchfleld, counsel for Jus
tice Hooker, announced to-day that no
testimony would be submitted In behalf*
of the Justice. The conclusions of facts
submitted by Coman substantially were
as fallows:
In the case of Frank P. Ball, Justice
Hooker in 1398 asked George W. Bea\ -
ers, then superintendent of the salary
and allowance division of the Postofflce
Department, to appoint Ball to the Fre
donia postofflce, and it Is allaged that
the motive that "prompted Hooker t>>
secure the appointment for Ball waa to
permit him to pay a note of $3000 Ball
had given the wife of Justice Hooker
in the course of a business trans
action.
It was further shown that Hooker
entered into a partnership with per
sons in Dunkirk fcrr the constr'i
of a building and that a lease was exe
cuted with the United States Goven
ment for the use of a portion of .the
building as a postofflce at a rental of
11350.

LANTERN CLUB HONORS
CAPTAIN CANTWELL
GIVES BANQUET TO NAVAL OFFICER
PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE LANTKRN CLUB AND WELL-KNOWN T*A
VAL OniCKK WHO WAS THE GI'EST OF HONOR AT A BANQUET GIVEN
BY THE ORGANIZATION LAST SATURDAY NIGHT
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO, April 12.â The Lantern
Club was the scene, Saturday night,
of one of the most thoroughly enjoy
able festivities in the history of this
popular and prosperous organization.
The guest of honor of the evening Mas
Captain J..C. Cantwell, who has been
appointed to the command of the rev
enue cutter McCulloch, and who will
sail shortly for the north. Captain
Cantwell is deservedly popular wher
ever he is known, and as his journey
to the frozen seas will separate him
for a long time from his host of friends
here, the banquet in his honor was not
alone a tribute of good fellowship and
good will, but a farewell, and sincere
good wishes for his future.
The toastmaster of the occasion was
H. Clay Miller, who was particularly
happy in the role. Among those who
spoke were President George A. Story,
to whose energies so much of the per
manent success of the club is due,
Captain J. C. Cantwell, W. J. Martin,
A. J. Treat, W. M. Field, J. W. Har
rison, Mrs. J. W. Harrison and W B.
Gilbert. Gordon Robs, one of the ar
tist members of the club, presented
Captain Cantwell with a cartoon rep
resenting him as inflicting one of his
poems upon a captured poacher of the
frozen north. The victim showed his
terror and spoke in lineaments the
horror of the punishment meted out to
him. Captain Cantwell's versability
with the quill was splendid food for
the shaft of the cartoonist. At the con
clusion of the banquet the guests re
paired to the assembly hall for a
dance and another success of the club
had passed into its history.
The Lantern Club is now one of the
most popular social organizations In
the State. Within a year it has grown
from a mere handful of enthusiastic
whist players to a thoroughly organ
ized club of more than one hundred
members, men and women prominent
in the best affairs of Sausalito. So
rapid has been the growth of tbe so
ciety as one of the leading country
clubs about the bay, that a movement
is now on foot among the members to
build and equip their own home.
Until a month ago the fair sex was
barred from the pleasures of the Lan
tern Club, but the ladies demurred and
had their way. The Lantern Club ab
sorbed Las Amigas Club, and the
united organization is infinitely better
for the absorption. The officers of the
Lantern Club are: George A. Story,
president; John M. Kilgarif, vice presi
dent; W. M. Roberts, secretary and
treasurer. Directors: Captain J. C.
Cantwell. Bruce Bonney, E. Alexander
and H. Clay Miller.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1905.
ASKS FAIRNESS
FOR TURCHETTI
A jury was impaneled in Judge
Dunne's court yesterday afternoon to
try the case of Blviso Turchetti on a
charge of murder. The defendant is
represented by Attorneys A. Ruef and
Lynch. Assistant District Attorney
Whiting is prosecuting.
Attorney Ruef asked each juror if he
had any prejudice against Italians,
particularly in view of the horrible
murder of Blaggio Vilardo at 736^A
Green street. He received an answer in
the negative. The defendant's attor
neys think that in view of the strong
public feeling against the murderer or
murderers of Vilardo the defendant will
not have as fair a trial aa if that mur
der had not occurred.
Turchetti is charged with the murder
of William McAllister, a marine en
! gineer, at Kearny and Pacific streets
|on last Christmas night. McAllister
: and some friends had been celebrating
! and while turning from Kearny into,
i Pacific stree^on their way home they
| bumped into the defendant and two
i-other friends.
Daniel Webster, who was walking
beside McAllister, said he heard Mc-
I Allister say "Excuse me," which was
; immediately followed by a shot and
; McAllister staggered against the wall.
Webster saw the defendant with a re
volver in his hand and saw him put it
in his pocket as he walked away. A
revolver was found in the defendant's
pocket when he was arrested by Po
liceman Evatt a few minutes later.
( Witnesses for the defense allege that
McAllister and his friends attacked the
defendant and friends and profess not
to know who fired the shot. The ex
amination of the witnesses will go on
this morning.

DEVLIN ABATES
LEGAL VOODOO
Secures Conviction of W. H.
Boren for His Connection
With Timber Land Entries
ACCUSED DENIES ALL
Federal District Attorney
Makes Vigorous and Clean
Cut Plea to the Jury
United States District Attorney Rob
ert T. Devlin took the voodoo off the
office yesterday by personally securing
the conviction of W. H. Boren. indicted
fc-r subornation of perjury in con
nection with timber land entries in
Shasta County. After a clean cut and
logical presentation of tacts by Mr.
Devlin the jury did not require more
than sufficient time to take one ballot
on each of the four counts of the in
dictment. The first three cases tried
under Mr. Devlin's administration re
sulted in acquittals. Two were counter
feiting' cases and oflie was the prosecu
tion of two sailors for goins on strike
at sea.
Mr. Devlin had taken no part in these
trials. Boren was an associate of H.
W. Miller and Frank E. ivineart, who
were engaged in having persons in
California and Oregon make entries
for timber lands and transfer tha lands
to the Washington Mining: Company.
Miller was indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury of Oregon and was taken
to Portland for trial, and Kincart
escaped. In all the eases Miller and j
his confederates made the victims Day
the filing fees and $25 for Bortn's ser
vices for picking out and describing the
lands, and after the victims had trans
ferred the claims to the niiliinK com- .
pany the money promised them was
never paid.
The indictment against Boren
charged him with having caused Mr.
and Mrs. John G. Martin. John M. Lay
ton and Jesse Stump to swear falsely to
the applications for entry. These wit
nesses testified to the. facts as set forth
in the indictment implicating: Boren as
the steerer and adviser of the scheme.
Boren went on the stand yesterday and
swore that when he went to the lt>nrl >
office at Redding last November with
the persons named he held no conver
sation with them whatever. Mr.
Devlin put him through a rigorous and
crafty cross-examination and drew
from the witness the fact that he had
been eneraged in the business of select
ing timber lands in this State and Ore- 'â 
gon for four years past, and that tim
ber "cruising" was his means of liveli
hood.
Judge de Haven instructed the iurv
after Mr. Devlin had closed his areu
ment that he could not find any statute
which requires a person aPDlyinÃ for
land to state that he has visited and
examined the tract personally, but that
other statements made by the appli
cants should be considered.
Friday morning: was fixed as the
time for sentence, and Boren was re
manded into the* custody of the United
States Marshal. Attorney Devlin was
warmly congratulated by the bystand
ers on his victory.
SAYS ATTEMPT WAS MADE
TO KILL HIM WITH POISON'
Jerome Childs Gives Alle?*ed Reason
Why He Deeded Probity
to His Wife.
"While it is true that prior to Octo
ber 14, 1903, I deeded the Tower
House, nineteen miles from Redding,
to my wife, Edith, I did so through
her false protestations of love and be
cause I was in fear of sudden death
from poison at the hands of persons
unknown to me, who had attempted
my life, and I wanted my wife to- get
my property," says Jerome Childs in
an affidavit filed yesterday against his
wife's petition that her suit for divorce
against him be tried in this cfty.
Mrs. Childs asks that her husband's
application for a change of venue to
Napa County be denied, she claiming
he is a resident of this city. She
stated in support of her claim that he
had deeded her the Tower House and
then left Napa County for this city.
His answer to this claim is given
above. He says he is now residing at
the Tower House and has brought
suit to cancel the deed given his wife.
The application for a change of venue
will be heard next week.
Decrees of divorce were granted yes
terday to Cora C. from James E. Far
ley for desertion, Lizzie J. from Charles
Roper for extreme cruelty, Emma A.
from John S. Ford for willful neglect
and Evelyn from Edward A. Zinn for
desertion. Suits for divorce were filed
by Adelaide against Joseph Knight for
infidelity, .Sarah against Michael Mul
rooney for cruelty; Annie J. against
Walter B. Kelly for failure to provide,
desertion and cruelty; Annie against
Gustav Keiser for cruelty, Edward A.
against Avy A. Kitto for desertion,
Jeannle against Fulmer Carlton for

CHINESE PRISONER TRIES
TO END LIFE IN CELL
Ixrale Dip Makes Several Ineffectual
Attempts and Is Sent to Insane
Ward in Hospital.
Louie Dip, a Chinese, made several
ineffectual attempts in his cell at the
City Prison yesterday morning to
commit suicide. He tied his queue
around his neck and tried to strangle
himself. Then he attempted to tie
the end of his queue to a projecting
piece of iron on top of the cell, but
failed to reach it. His next attempt
was to butt his head against the wall
of the cell, and finally he shoved his
head through the hole in the iron
door and sawed away his neck on the
sharp edge in the effort to cut
through the skin. He was sent to the
Insane ward at the Central Emer
gency Hospital.
Last Sunday Louie Dip made two
attempts to murder Louie Hong, a
teacher, in his room at 738 Washing
ton street because Hong did not com
ply with his demand for money. On
the first attempt he used a hatchet
on Hong's head, and on the" second
attempt a cleaver was utilized. Dip
is a highbinder and had returned
from a trip to Sacramento on Sun
day morning. He is waiting his pre
liminary examination on a charge of
assault to murder.

THREE MEN PUT
END TO LIVES
Nicholas Blanken, a grocer, 75
years old and who resided at 505
Broadway, shot himself through the
brain with a revolver last Tuesday
night. Mrs. Herrera, a Mexican wom
an who did his "cooking for him,
found his dead body sitting in a chair
at 9 o'clock yesterday morning, a re
volver clutched in his right hand. He
had put the muzzle of the weapon
into his mouth and discharged one
shot. Blanken had been sick for
some time and suffered from despond
ency because of that fact. He was a
native of Germany.
George Staacke, a commission mer
chant, whose place of business was at
320 Sansome street, killed himself for
a similar reason yesterday forenoon,
and in a similar manner at his resi
dence, 2610 Howard street. He had
been despondent for some time on ac
count of sickness and the threatened
loss of his sight. At half past 8
o'clock Mrs. George H. Howard, a
relative, went to his room and gave
him a cup of coffee. At that time he
complained of sore throat and tooth
ache and of having slept but little
during the night. Two hours and a
half later Mrs. Elizabeth Howard
went to his room to make up his bed
and found him dead in bed with the
revolver clutched in both hands and
blood streaming from his mouth. Mr.
Staacke was a widower, 67 years old
and a native of Germany.
Richard Hennessey, a laborer, who
had been rooming off and on for three
years in the lodging-house at 502
Washington street, hanged himself to
his bedpost with a strap last Tuesday
night. He was intoxicated when he
retired. He had been in the habit of
going to the country and working as
a laborer for a few weeks and then
coming to this city and spending his
money on a spree. W. P. Thompson,
manager of the lodging-house, re
marked that a man who would work
hard in the country for a little money
and then spend it all In dissipation in
the city ought to be chloroformed.
Hennessey was 38 years old.
IMPROVEMENT CL.T7B HOLDS
MEETING AT PIXLEY feAIiL
Is Making: Efforts to Have Polk
Street Opened to the
Bay.
The Polk-street Improvement Club
had a rousing meeting Tuesday night
at Pixley Hall. The members are very
much in earnest in a campaign to have
Polk street improved. Qoldwin Mc-
Avoy, the president, was in the chair.
J. W. Usilton acted as secretary. The
extension of Polk street from Bay to
Le\\is, which would give Polk street di
rect communication to the bay, was
the principal subject discussed. The
executive committee, composed of Val
Schmidt, L. H. Kohn. L. E. Bovin,'
John E. Quinn and Join Elliott, re
ported that it was making splendid
progress in the campaign and that they
hoped soon to see a straight sweep of
street to the. bay.
The club is greatly in favor of hav
ing the underground system of elec
tricity run cm the Sutter-street line
when it is changed, but will support
the overhead system in preference to
the present cable line. The club also
wants the big arc lights that are now
hung on the poles on the corners of thÂ«
streets placed directly in the center
of the street intersection.

THE MODERN CITY
OUR war of the Revolution was fought by a population o
which only 3 per cent lived in cities. Self-government was in
stituted here by a rural population, self-dependent and self
centered. It valued freedom and good government, and secured botl
'self and for us. Now more than one-third of our population v.
penned up in cities. At the present rate of increase in a few years ;
majority will be in cities. The tendency of our present Europea!
immigration is to herd in the towns. The immigrants get naturalizec
nas they legally can. and many of them sooner. Their first ex
perience in American institutions comes in their contact with th<
corruption and graft of municipal government, and when this ex
perience is carried over into State and national politics there will b<
prepared a situation that threatens to destroy the republic.
Mr. Fairfax Wheelan. in his address to the Y. M. C. A., state,
with his usual clearness and force the danger to all government thai
lies in the misgovernment of cities. His words may well arouse the
Thoughtful attention. The people of San Francisco cannot bet
ter things by being horrified at the corruptions of New York. 1101
ihose of New York by contemplation of the worse state of Philadcl
phia. This city must look at home and can benefit New York and
Philadelphia only by showing them an example in the cleansing
that can be done here. It is of no use that the audience in the
hall of the Y. M. C. A. listens and approves when Mr. Wheelan tells
ihe truth. If those who hear do not gird them and go forth to do.
r applause is an empty and vain demonstration.
If a city is a dangerous place to rear children, it is so by assent
- parents of the children. No father willingly brings up his
g where their physical health is imperiled. If the peril is cor
rijjible by himself, he corrects it. If it be due to public neglect, he
rebukes the public authority that should correct it. Then why should
ung where the moral conditions, permitted or imposed
by public authority, make it sure that they are to be corrupted and
degenerated by contacts that they cannot avoid? With one-third
of our coming citizens exposed to the wide open influences, fostered
for the sake of graft by a corrupt municipal government, how dark is
the outlook for the future !
It becomes the highest patriotism to work for a higher standard
ty government. The peril of present conditions is shown by
"he plainest of sign?. The demoralization of the young in cities
res now a special juvenile court to deal with offenses committed
by the youth as a result of evil communications to which they are
Bed. Men go about thoughtlessly, while complaining of gov
ernment blackmail and graft. This one is the victim of graft be
cause he wants to build a house, and another by official blackmail
of his business. Yet another is injured in his business because an
â  iffice holder in a position to dictate to some line of trade compels it
to buy where he orders.
All these go but a little way into the matter when they treat
these things as affecting them alone. The same system from which
they suffer is the destroyer of their children. It smites them and
a 1 the same time infects the future with a pestilence of immorality
\\!iich will finally extend to the larger concerns of government and
â  helm the country with an epidemic of corruption. Surely San
Francisco has had an object lesson that should rouse her people to
action. It is criminal folly to content us with saying that we are not
;:ic worst city. Patriotism and self-preservation require that wo
should be content only with being the best city. That is the object of
the movement in politics that is now stirring here.
These words of Fairfax Wheelan should be displayed in every
. school and counting-room in San Francisco: "If we are going
'<â¢ make America free, we will have to make over our cities. If you
would keep the nation worthy, you must keep your cities worthy â
make them righteous temples of self-government. The children of
. are the citizens of to-morrow. What will you do with them
in cities where there is no proper place to rear children?"
If we say that is the businessof the school teachers, we are at
The teachers are as apt to be the victims of graft, against
which they protest at their peril, as are the business men. Tf we say
be business of the preachers, we are at fault, for in cities they
are crying aloud to ears that hear not. But if we say it is our busi
we. being the business men. the teachers, the preachers, the.
professional men and the mechanics and laborers, all embarked in a
common destiny and with the welfare of one household related to the
welfare of all. we say wisely. But no matter how wisely we say,
1 isdom is vain unless we do as well as say.
If the spirit of Fairfax Wheelan become the spirit of the city,
aft nor greed, nor combined malfeasance in office, no height
nor breadth nor depth of cunning and corruption can prevail against
it. He has shown the courage of his convictions and has coined his
convictions into deeds and has invoked the law to punish criminals
against good government, at risk and peril to himself. If his ex
ample inspire the people, it will become the large example set by the
tself to inspire other cities.
In the coming election there is only one issue: Make the city
government decent by putting it in the hands of decent men. When
it is made decent all proper things will be done. The enemies of de
cency will propose novel things and profess zeal for many things.
They will hinder and try to divide and balk and bar the determined
which inscribes the one issue on its standard. Hut we have
faith that decency will prevail and San Francisco will cast off the
shame of being ruled by officers under indictment, and by covert
felons who are fattening on official opportunities. Our government
is now farmed out to bloodsuckers, like the tax collecting of a Turk
ish vilayet. It is Siamesed with boodlers and bums. Let 11s cut
cament by doing: our civic duty.
LADIES, AND LAND CULTURE.
ASTUTF statesmen of France have been trying to solv< that
modern problem, "back to the land" ; how to preserve the right
balance of a nation's greatness by keeping some of the ablest
of the population devoted to the cultivation of the soil, and how to
make ambitious people tend the land for the love of the kind of life it
bring*- to its devotees. To this end they seem to be getting a grasp
cm! a new idea, and a most promising one. It is to educate a superior
if women at agricultural colleges and train them to make look
er the land profitable, pleasant and dignified.
That's a good idea â just to get woman talent directed land
but French statesmen see farther afield than just that. The
attraction of superior women living on the land will naturally pull
'he capable and ambitious men back to the gleam of the bright steel
hare and the lure of the waving grain. It is the most sensible
ion of the great problem yet proposed.
This question of the tending of the land being neglected bc
of the excitement and larger promise of city life is one of the
- studies of the modern sociologist. It is important even
here : but in France it has become grave to the degree called critical.
Some of their land troubles, though, are just the opposite of ours.
Here, our economists tell us, the holdings are too large. In France
he holdings have become so small that the system is ruinous to
:ltural welfare. The juxtaposition of these two facts makes
rine example of the truth that the art of industry as of life con
n finding the golden mÂ«an.
France's experience should warn us to avoid extremes in seeking
to change our land-holding system. In France the continuous pro
vision after the death of the holder has reduced the
size of holdings till they will not support a family. M. Rueau, Min
ister of Agriculture, wishes to remedy this by a new homestead law
making the land inalienable, and held by primogeniture. A feature
of the proposed law is that mortgages on the farm would be forbid
den except for actual cultivation and improvement of the land. Thai
is part of the plan to make rural industry appeal to intelligent and
well trained people. Another is the before mentioned scheme of
hol4inÂ£ capable men where superior women are content to stay.

ASTOR FORTUNE WILL
REACH BILLION MARK
IN FIFTEEN YEARS
The Astor properties now increase |
as never before, writes Burton J. Hen- !
; driok in the April McClure's. Land i
values in the last five years "have
jumped fifty and one hundred per
cent. The forces already described
i have been especially marked sinre
â¢ 1900. The city's population grows at
j the rate of 100,000 a year. In many
i sections New York has been largely
reconstructed; new headquarters of
retail trade and business have devel
oped; public improvements initiated
since then â tunnels, bridges, subways,
railroad terminals â aggregate in cost
not far from $300,000,000. There
; has been a general movement of cor-
I porations toward New York: prae
! tioally all the newly organized com
i binations. for example, have located
I there. When John Jacob died. In
| 1S90, his estate, inherited by William
' Waldorf, was estimated at $l50.00D.
000. If it were worth that then, it
is worth $300,000,000 now. The es
f tate of William Astor. who died In
I 1892. inherited by the present John
I Jacob, was generally placed at about
! $65,000,000. If that were an accu
j rate figure, It must now aggregate
at least $100,000,000. The combined
Astor fortune thus increases with ac
1 celerated momentum. In fifteen or
j twenty years, at the present rate of
: progress, it will have reached the
â¢ billion mark. And then it will go on
! even faster, until the ordinary mind
is appalled at the portentous figures.
We have seen that the $2,000,000 in
vested by John Jacob has multiplied
at least two hundred times in one j
hundred years. (It has reached, at
j a conservative estimate, $450,000,
: 000.) If the same rate be main
tained for another century the Astor
fortune will attain the unimaginable
I total of eighty billions. We stand
j aghast at such a possibility; but not
i more so than would have John Ja
cob's contemporaries had they fore
seen the present reality. In 1830
John Jacob Astor was the only man
In New York who was worth a mil
lion dollars.
one who is responsible for the prickly j
barrier of conventions which seem to
tlie impatient suitor an evil spell.
Probably she as well as old Dime Na- I
ture knows what she is about.
The wedding is for the bride. '
Everybody knows it. even those who !
hesitate about admitting the fact. It
is for the bride's sake that the short
quarter of an hour which the mar- I
riage ceremony actually takes is
raised above its ordinary market j
value as mere lime and becomes the j
most expensive quarter of an hour in i
parental experience.
All the pomp and circumstance of
the conventional wedding is full of
symbolism to the girl who feels that
the rite is the consecration of her love.
â  Vanity becomes a humble handmaid
en of sentiment.
The bride does not glory in her rich j
gown, with its train and its expensive i
; accessories, chiefly because it Is a con- I
j spiouous waste of goods, although this
fact may gratify her pride, but be
! cause it is her wedding gown, the
j gown that means more to her than
Rny other which she will ever wear
i In al! her life.
She does not covet orange blos-'i

' Not one girl in ten would wish to
two-step into marriage. ; The solemn
strains of "Lohengrin" suit well a
I bride's young mood of mingled fear
' and faith. The occasion is not an
hour of careless joy. It is a serious
! moment of coronation, which requires
â  a setting worthy of the crown. Rarely
would a girl take away, from it a par

THE FARMER'S WIFE
FREES HER MIND
To thÂ« Editor of The Call:
Tour editorial under the heading of
"King Farmer" leads one to believe
that you understand one phaee of the
subject under discussion. But there
are several phases and on a better un
derstanding of the farmer's position
and an adjustment according to the
merits of his case depends the weal
or woe of our nation. It is true that
Secretary Wilson showed the "ugly
duckling" farmer his relation to the
rest of thÂ» country, and Uncle Sam's
efforts in the promotion of irrigation
show that he realizes he must do
something besides pluck the "goose
that lays the golden egg."
How long must we wait for our
State papers to say, "If you don't see
what you want, ask for it?" When
can we as farmers and their families
get the same space as the "sports"
and the "smart set?" In other places
it is said the farmer is sure of a living,
Deo volente. But here we, who de
pend on some one else for our water
for irrigation, must go through the
whole act, though that water may be
doled out so as to prevent any possi
bility of profit
We read of the experts on Irrigation
holding a meeting in Berkeley, March
18. Among other things we see this
report: "One of the actual discoveries
of irrigation engineers is the extraor
dinary importance of winter irriga
tion." Don't we relish that, we who
haye seen our husband practice win
ter irrigation for fifteen years, only to
be ignored when they presumed to ask
thai they, who made a lifework of
MANY THINGS BEST
LEFT UNSAID
"Yes.V said ' the young
woman.
SOME persons are the happy pos
sessors of what is called tact. There
are not many of them, and those
that have it are more likely to be
women than men. The ages have given
womankind social faculty. Consequent
ly, when a woman lacks it, it is much
more noticeable than a corresponding
deficiency on the part of a mere man.
A well-known and highly esteemed
resident of another city, himself an ex
emplar of delightful manners and cour
tesy, has for wife a woman whose ten
dency to say just the wrong thing can
hardly be overcome. A woman of the
kindliest feeling, it is continually
bringing her into situations which
would be intensely embarrassing if she
were at all aware of them.
For instance, a modest young man
approached Mrs. Fairbrother at an
afternoon reception not long ago. and
the following: conversation took place:
I am Mr. Castor, Mrs. Fairbrother,"
said the young man, not quite at ease;
"dc-nt you remember me?"
"No," riaid Mrs. Fairbrother, with en
tire candor, after studying him through
her lorgnette for a lonp: moment.
"But â but â I was introduced to you,
Mrs. Fairbrother," he stammered.
"Oh, yes, I remember that!" said the
lady.
She did not mean that at all, but it
left those who heard it gasping.
"1 am going to give a public reading
next week," a young lady c-f much
literary talent said to Mrs. Fairbrother
a \vs>ek or two ago.
"From your own works?" inquired
Mrs. Fairbrother, interestedly.
"Yes," said the young woman of let
ters, pleasantly.
"It is Lent, isn't it?" commented Mrs.
Fairbrother, sweetly.
It is difficult to jest with talent like
that. Two young men were going to
dine the other evening, and they ask
ed an older man who was standing
beside Mrs. Fairbrother if he would go
with them.
"I have company coming to dinner at
home," explained the man invited.
The man inviting him, seeing a
chance for a little jest, said, "But we'll
bn company, too."
"You would not be the company he
has at home," explained Mrs. Fair
brothei.
Her husband had a slight attack of
illness, just enough to keep him in the
house, without any suffering. Mrs.
Fairbrother herself did not mention it,
and it was not known outside of the
household.
'Won't you and Mr. Fairbrother
come to dinner next Tuesday?" asked
an acquaintance during the progress
of this indisposition, seeing the wife in
the afternoon.
"Not this next week." said Mrs. Fair
brother, with the best intentions in the
world. "I have to be very particular
where Mr. Fairbrother goes this next
week."
A youthful poet spent part of an eve
ning explaining to Mrs. Fairbrother
that his verses always came by in
spiration and not by design. A few
days afterward she overheard a young
lady importuning the poet to write
some verses for her.
"But he never writes poetry inten
tionally." explained Mrs. Fairbrother,
in his defense.
In much the same way she succeeded
In misrepresenting a well-known
painter, who is notoriously particular
about the preparation of his pigments,
by telling a crowd who were admiring
one of his pictures. "Mr. Vandyck al
ways mixes his colors, doesn't he?"

lieve there is a sentiment in favor of
Justice and right. The newspapers are
to be the means to bring it about.
While we must know the history of
the past to work out the solution of
our future, the daily press must be the
medium of progress.
The farmer's status has not only a
financial and commercial aspect, but
must be considered, patriotically, from
his moral responsibility to his race."
As a farmer's wife these truths have
been emphasized to me, when not one
of my six babies, before it couM walk
or talk, crept after me with any paper
or Journal they could reach, when they
wanted to be taken up. The signs of
the times tell us that we who feed and

with no better employment than dis

sheds crocodile tears over the woman

Which to Further Idea
There is considerable activity among
the Irish societies affiliated with the
Celtic Union a* to the proposed Irish
hall. This project has been going for
ward for some years and there Is about
$15,000 in the treasury, 5500 of which
came from the last St. Patrick's day
celebration. The slow progress was not
the fault of the Celtic Union, but was
owing to various matters that Inter
fered with the work.
The St. Patrick's day convention
urged the building of the hall, and as
a consequence new life was given to
the movement There are several
forces now at work and a preliminary
meeting wae held last week at Knights

DAMAGES ARE SETTLED
Street Committee Refuses
to Allow Any More Blast
ing on Telegraph Hill
The Supervisors' Street Committee j
yesterday recommended the final pa*- I
sage of the ordinance granting the
Santa Pe Railroad Company a fran
chise for additional track privileges in '
connection with its existing right of
way in the Potrero. Caotain A. H. '
Payson, vice president of the company,
effected a settlement of the claims for
damages with all but one protestant,
and the committee decided to hear no
more claims of that character. The
ordinance will be considered by tht I
board at its meeting on Monday, April
24.
The committee yesterday refused to I
grant the request of the Globe Grain
and Milling Company, that it be al
lowed to continue blasting on Kearny ;
and Chestnut streets. The committee
expressed its determination to stop the
general demolition of Telegraph Hill,
because the desire of the general public
seems to be to preserve the landmark.
The committee stated that the com
pany's permit called for the privilege .
of grading for a spur track, but advan- '
tage had been taken for more extended '
operations. The committee agreed not j
to bring injunction proceedings to re
strain the company from blasting on
condition that it cease operations.
W. E. Keller, president of the com
pany, wanted to apply for a new per
mit to blast, but the committee de- !
clared that the application would be
denied. Keller then informed the com- .
mittee that the company would cer
tainly continue to blast away the rock ,
in order to lower the street to the of- j
ncial grade so it could get across to
Its warehouse.
Keller wanted the committee to allow â¢
the company to cut away a cliff on its
property 100 feet in height. Keller said
it would take about a year to do the
work. Braunhart declared that Gray
Bros., who have the contract for the
blasting, would take three years, as
they would remove the rock only as
they needed it. He said It would sim
ply mean a transfer of its quarry from ;
Douglass street.
The committee decided to have an
appraisement made of the property of j
the company, with a view of its ac- I
quisition by the city. Action on the
proposed injunction proceedings was
postponed until a week from next
Monday, and Keller agreed to do no
blasting during that period.

WATER EXPERT TESTIFIES
FOR SPRING VALLEY
Hydranlic Engineer Rudolph Herinar
Comes All the Way From New
York to Give His Opinion.
A new and important witness was
examined yesterday before United
States Commissioner Heacock in the
case of the Spring Valley Water Works
against the city and county of San
Francisco to prevent the enforcement
of the proposed schedule bt water
rates. He is Rudolph Hering. consult
ing engineer of the New York water
supply system. Mr. Hering is well
known as a hydraulic and sanitary en
gineer in New York, Chicago. Phila
delphia, Washington, Buffalo, New Or
leans, San Francisco and Honolulu.
He testified in answer to questions by
M. B. Kellogg, attorney for the water
company, that he had studied the
Spring Valley system for two years.
He said that there was more necessity
in California for the storage of large
quantities of water than in the Eastern
States. wJiere rain fell during the sum
mer months, on account of the danger
of a dry season and a consequent
diminution of the water supply. In
this climate, he said, it was absolutely
necessary to provide storage sufficient
for two or three years' supply. He
added that It was good financial policy
to purchase real estate years in ad
vance of its being required for water
supply purposes.
Mr. Hering's direct examination will
be concluded to-day and the cross-ex
amination by Assistant City Attorney-
John S. Partridge will be begun next
Monday.
OFFICIAIjS MUST PAY

Judge Troatt Enjoins Auditor and
Treasurer From JUslnjtl' Public

Judge Troutt has decided that prem
iums upen bonds of city officials must
be paid by the officials themselves and
that the city cannot legally pay them.
This opinion was reached in the case
brought by Julius C. Saulman to re
strain Auditor Baehr and Treasurer
McDougaJd from paying the bond
premium claims of city officials.
The city officials demurred to Saul
man's complaint, but when It was
overruled they made no further de
fense and failed to file an answer. De
fault was entered against them and
yesterday Judge Troutt Issued a per
manent Injunction prohibiting the
payment of the premiums by ths de
fendants.

that the land at present fronts on a

the Cause for Complaint
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April
12. â The recent strictures made against
Hurdler Lanagan by Trainer Christie
of the Berkeley track squad has caused
much indignation at Stanford. This
criticism has culminated in the follow
ing editorial, which appeared in to
night's issue of the Daily Palo Alto:
The apology of Trainer Christie of the Uni
versity of California for his recent outbreak
in the case of a Stanford athlete of whOK9
standing he was In doubt Is but small repara
tion for his offense. The eligibility of the man
in question had been passed upon by the man
agers and the faculty athletic committees of
thÂ«> two universities, whose duty it is to deal
wllh such matters. The public attack upon
these committees by a man employed to at
tend solely to the physical ne*Hl? of the track
candidates was an Insult to the representative
men who compose the committees, and the
practical assertion that Stanford was paying
the athlete's railroad fare was an added
gratuitous insult to the man himself and to
tho university. Apologies for offenses of this
kind do little good: the charges have been.

Cnnavan Gets His.
Matt Canavan the Beau Brummel

liner, was stowed away in four rounds
at the San Francisco Athletic Club
last night by a youth he was to have
stopped in four rounds. Matt escort

south side to root for him, but they
had to go without shouting. Canavan
says he broke his wrist in one of the

STILL UNPLACED
Managers and Their Politi
cal Friends Continue to
Make Sullen Warfare
HANLON COMING HOME
Popular Little Boxer Prom
ised a Match Soon by
the Hayes Valley Club
There is still a sullen warfare going
on among the fight promoters and their
powerful political friends over the per
mit for this month. Persons who are
supposed to be in touch with such mat
ters say there is not a possible chance
of the Britt- White fight taking place
this month under the auspices of the
Yosemite Club.
The question of granting the permit
will come up again next Monday. Man
ager Jim Coffroth and his friends have
used every influence at their command.
Instead of gaining votes they have been
losing some which there is apparently
no chance of regaining.
If some other promoter should have
the required strength on Monday it is
possible the fighters would sign new
articles and the fight could then go on.
The quarrels of the promoters have
proved wearisome to the followers of
boxing, and there is apparently little
interest being taken in the affair. The
fact that the serious charges made by
Manager Nolan have not been contro
verted has also had a depressing effect
on the meeting of Britt and White.
Many people in this city like to have
a little bet on a fight, and when they
learn they did not get a run for their
money their interest in a boxer be
comes lukewarm. This was shown in
the case of Walcott, who was never a
drawing card after his fake with La
vigne. A boxer may buy a referee once
and get away with it, but he cannot do
it all the time. The same holds good
of one who would agree to lose to a
negro.
Battling Nelson is in light training at
Larkspur and will be ready to enter
the ring at short notice if an oppor
tunity presents itself. He does not in
tend to be taken unawares.
Eddie Hanlon is on his way home
from the East. He will fight some one
before the Hayes Valley Athletic Club
either late in this month or early next
month. Manager Levy first thought
of matching him against Young Cor
bett or Willie Fitzgerald, but neither
of these can do 130 pounds at such
short notice. Among the boxers un
der consideration are Harry Lewis,
Chester Goodwin, Young Erne, Tim
Callaghan and Kid Herman. The ob
jection against all these is that they
are not well known here.
The Hayes Valley Club has a strong
card for its regular exhibition to-mor
row night In Woodward's Pavilion.
Bob Lundie and Bob Cairns, both hard
hitters, will meet in the principal bout.
The last time they met the Judges or
dered an extra round to determine the
winner.

Portland Defeats Oakland in
a Sensational Game at
Idora Park.
V
Graham and Essick Engage
in a Battle Royal With
the Sphere.
OAKLAND. April 12.â Sixteen stren
uous, nerve-shattering spasms were
reeled off by Hawbacker's Oaks and
McCreedie's Monsters on the Idora
Park diamond to-day before the great
game was won by the plucky players
from Portland. Score 3 to 2.
It was a "Parsifal" performance of
the popular national pastime that be
gan in the afternoon and ended in the
evening when the sun was about to
duck its face. The few fortunate and
favored fans who witnessed the mem
orable contest will recall it whenever
they grow reminiscent of doings on
the diamond.
Graham and Essick were opponents
on the firing line, and both twisted su
perb ball during the prolonged and
frenzied fray. Essick was relieved by
Garvln in the sixteenth frame, as the
strain was evidently weakening his
working wing. Although the Commut
ers hammered out fifteen hits, four of
which were tagged for two sacks, they
were able to work but two players over
the pan. Portland plucked a dozen
swats from Graham's delivery. Includ
ing a three-bagger and a brace of two
baggers.
Pitcher Essick. after grittily serving
up the sphere for fifteen innings, won
his own game in the sixteenth by
soaking a solid swat to center good for
a pair of corners and sending in his
battery mate. Ladder McLean, who got
on the paths through a scorching
smash over the third sack. Oakland
got three men on bases in the last. half
of the sixteenth period, and. with no
one out, it appeared that the Commut
ers would tie the score or win the
game, but they did neither. Byrnes,
the first man up. tapped a safety to
third. Graham lobbed one to Runkle,
who dallied with the package while
Graham was moving to first and
Byrnes to the halfway stopping place.
Then Van Haltren paraded to the
plate *with his walloping willow, bunted
a joker to . Garvin, who tossed it to
Runkle to catch Byrnes. Jimmy dived
in without being touched, and the
house was full. Francks batted to
Schlafley. who heaved the leather to
McLean in time to end Byrnes' useful
ness. Kruger, the next Commute- up,
was fcunkoed into biting-. \
The Oregon Giants manufactured
their third and winning tally in the
sixteenth round. Beanpole McLean
swatted a vicious one to left and
crossed the rubber on Essick's beauti
ful biff to the Scoreboard for two bases.
Moskimon was ordered to bat for Mc-
Murray in the ninth, when the Com
muters had Kelly on third and only one
man down. The medico drove a high
fly that Schlafley captured. Graham.
th<? next Oak to bat. sent a terrific
bingle to Jakey Atz, who made a star
tling stop and threw Oscar out at first.
Van Buren was fined $15 by Czar
Slats Davis while at bat in the sixth
Inning for using language unbecoming
a gentleman and was banished from

STEAM -HIP WILL CALL AT MIDWAY ISLAND FOR ORDERS
Fear of Russian interference with
contraband laden steamships bound for
Japanese ports is again beginning to
affect shippers and shipowners at this
port, and Captain Smith of the steam
ship Doric, which sails to-day for
Japan, has received orders to go from
here direct to Midway and there await
instructions. It was intended that the
Doric should go from here direct to
Yokohama. The possibility of Russian
naval success has caused a change of
plan. as the- Doric's hold con
tains enough contraband of war
to damn her in . short order should
i ho ships of the Czar overhaul
her. So from hire she will steam
with all speed to the midocean cable
station. By the time she reaches Mid
way, it is expected, the naval situation
will be clearer than it is now, and the
Doric's subsequent movements will be
directed accordingly.
The Dorie'a cargo of 4500 tons includes
â¢ge shipment of mess beef for
Japan, about 300 tons of leather and
machinery.
will carry about 50 cabin pas
. fetngcrs, luo Chinese and 50 Japanese.
Among the cabin passengere will be
rml tea buyers from the East and
Europe. Louie Eppinger, proprietor of
tht- Grand Hotel at Yokohama, is re
turning to Japan on the liner. Among
passengers for Manila, at which
port the Doric will call, is Miss Ruth
a of Osage, lowa, whu goes to the
Philippines to becomt the wife of an

STORM SWEEPS
SOUTHERN ISLES
Liner Mariposa Brings Word
of Hurricane Which Visits
Tahiti and the Vicinity
BIG TREES UPROOTED
Most Serious Loss Is in the!
Cocoanut Groves, Where
Many Palms Are Destroyed
Although the reign of equable sum- '
mer in the South Seas is rarely disturb
ed by storm, when the storm comes it
usually leaves behind a trail of trouble
which is remembered long: after the
skied have recovered their serenity.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Maxiposa, which arrived yester
day from Tahiti, brings word of two
hurricanes which visited that part j
uf the world in March. As far aa
known only one life was lost, but con
siderable damage was done, particular
ly to the cocoanut groves. While not
nearly so serious as the tidal wave and ;
hurricane on adjacent atolls more
than two years ago, this latest disturb- !
ance was sufficiently severe to be given '
a place in the annals of South Sea
storms.
The first hurricane visited the Pau
â  motu, or Low Archipelago group, on
March 13, and unroofed most of the
â  houses located in its path. No lives
i were lost, and the damage to shipping
I is supposed to have been slight. No re
! ports had been received from three or
four islands when the Maripoea left
Tahiti, but no news was considered
good news, as bad news travels swift
ly, even in the easy-going South Seas.
On the evening of March 24 a south
east gale developed into a hurricane
! near Tahiti, and the following day the
storm burst over Papeete. Great trees
were uprooted and in their fall car
ried to the ground houses and fences.
In the harbor the schooner Roberts, |
! better known here under her old name,
I the Herman, of treasure-hunting fame,
narrowly escaped destruction. A steam
launch owned by Peter Martin was
dashed on the rocks with a broken
back, and a Government cutter went
to pieces in the breakers. The French
missionary' schooner Le Voix dv Sud
lost all her sails. The schooner Teite,
owned and manned by natives, is miss
| ing and may have been lost.
The Marlposa encountered the outer
edge of the hurricane two days out
from Papeete. Not caring to take any
chances In the comparatively narrow
passage between the Tuamotu Islands,
Captain I<awless took the Mariposa
around Mutuhiva. This course adds a
hundred miles to the journey, but in
pplte of the storm and the extra dis
tance, the Mariposa was only six hours
iate reaching Papeete.
The most serious damage was the de
struction of many cocoanut palms. Not
until it is seven years old does the
cocoanut palm begin to bear profita
bly. Its value to its owner after that
is estimated at about $30 a year, so
that a hurricane which uproots a few
hundred of these stately trees is a Beri
ous visitation.
All was smiling at Tahiti when the
Mariposa started on her homeward
voyage. The paradise of the Pacltic
was itself again.

*n>e Cotton Markcn.
Brokers' wiras from New York yesterday
saiO; . ..
"Business in cotton was quiet and th* mar
ket featureless and dull. The unsettled
weather In the" South seems to check aggres
sive selling, and, while the market sold -off
some few points, there were good buying orders
on the ecale down. Wall street continued to
absorb the new crop - month. There was a
somewhat better spot demand in the South.
New Orleans sent a lot of bearish news to
the Â«ffeot that the producer would not cur
tall his acreage^ to any extent, and that many
cf them are withdrawing from th* organiza
tion to -reduce th* acreage. This was the im
portant cewa. There . seems to be a class of
buying in the market on the theory that cot
ton cannot go very much against th* pur
chasers,"
Dried Fruit in Â»w York.
' jt test mall reports from New York say:
â â JTelegraphic-adrtces from, the coast report a'
continuance of the demand for prompt shipment
of prunes, which has heretofore been referred
to in this column. Yesterday's advices reported
â ale* of 10 cars on the barfs of l^c'for the
intermediate cises. which, It Is stated, has re
ouced the â â  vii held in the Santa Clara Valley.
Thr. Middle West, as heretofore reported, is the
principal buyer, â  while tome sales of email sixes
are be-lng made for export. Included in the
rales above noted were 4 cars of 60s to go to
Chicago. There is reported to be a little more
interest shown In forward shipments from the
coast, but it â â â¢me to be confined to - 40Â»,
â¢which also re said to be In slightly better de
-~.ri.nd on the spot, with sales at 5%C. Bide cf
l?*c f. o. b. were wired out from here yester
day on several can of 40s, with what result
was not learned up to the close. Apricots for
future sbipment from the coast seem to Bat
no attractions for buyers at the prices named
and the market is easing off. It was reported
yesterday that last half or July shipment has
been offered here at 7c f . <v b. for choice Roy
e!s. * Spot stocks are going slowly Into con
sumption on small orders at about the prices
qucred below. Peaches are In limited supply
end with a fair Jobbing demand are firmly
held. There is no animation In raisins, except
in fancy Mi coast seeded, which are in small
Â«ock h*re; the tone of the market is weak.
While the Greek market, -according to some
cables, was a shade lower yesterday, spot cur
rants wrtrt '-K'&iy, with nothing offered at 4%c,
which prick, it is claimed represents an actual
Ice? to Eellers. I Persian dates continue to go
<jiiite freely into consumption, and with Â»up
plieÂ« on the spot limited tne. market is firm.
Kljtf are quiet, and In some quarters the feel
ing is rather easy."
Condition of General Trade.
.-^iÂ«- advices from New York say of current
business conditions: _ , '.. Â» â  _-ââ .._ . - Â
"Our railroads have been wonderfully . fa
vtT*d by national prosperity. In spite of the
grtat increase of facilities made In the last
two or three years our principal systems still
find themselves overtaxed with traffic and
with every probability of Its continuance for
me nth* to come. Both agriculture and In
dustry are also enjoying much prosperity. In
eitry part of the country trade is showing
increased activity and the volume of business
re-ported exceeds even the unprecedented vol
ume of the last two years.- The South Is
prosperous, having realized good average
prices for cotton; and so. too. the West, which
ie receiving good prices for Its products. In
the East the Iron and steel boom continue*
unprecedented. We are already beginning to
import plglron from abroad, our domestic fur
naces being unable to meet the demand. The
railroad* have again entered the Iron market
as heavy purchasers of steel rail*, ban, loco
motives, etc.. while thÂ» demand for Iron and
steel for - all sorts of constructive purposes Is
expanding marvelous!?; hence record prices
for United States Steel preferred. Just . now
real estate Is also experiencing one of those
periodic booms for wnicb the United State*
is noted. Land values are rising rapidly and
Dew buildings of all sorts are being erected.
This movement may be attributed to several
causes. First, security values have risen so
high hat .in many cases a satisfactory return
thereon is no â¢ longer possible and holders are
exchanging stocks and bonds for real estate,
which, for the time being at least, offers
better prospect*. Another influence in the
real estate market is the rapid growth of
population asd the fact that building has been
xnuch .restrained for a year or two by the high
cost of materials and high wage*.- In con
sequence rent* hare been steadily advancing,
especially In oosgested districts, until they
have reached a point attractive at least -to
speculative capital. It cannot be said, how
ever, that the speculation In real -estate has
yet obtained dangerous â¢ proportions; much of
the activity It perfectly legitimate and seems
destined to continue for some time 'to ' come,
although It is well worth remembering that
the climax of all great upward movements in
the United et&taa has usually been marked
by a real estate boom. History shows that
thea* movements la real estate â¢ have almost
la variably â  marked â¢ the crest of a forward
wave., and while the top may not have been
reached, there Is do reason to me why this
particular .movement should be any *yieep

New York Stock Market.
NTO' YORK, April 12â MovenssnU of stock
continued. to give evidence to-day of much un
certainty- on the part of the speculative oper
ators. â¢ The current new failed to account for
any depression and conjecture pointed to va
iioua explanation* of the palpable weight upon |
the market. Sign* of considerable strength
and of sharp weakness succeeded each other
all ay. Aggressive strength shown by 'a" few
stocks .failed to overcome the skeptical and
suspicious ' attitude of the , trading. Some of
Ciose.who sold stocks protested that they saw
- -iubiitbt* cvidtnc* of the setting: Tor thÂ« ac- j
vunt of some of the persons who have been ;
3:e mosty demonstrative .leaders of the bull I
cuspsilgn. - Considerable ' liquidation ~ was at
tributed to the account of orders received from
Western sources, .and the conviction held that
this reported >-* sure of . precaution was a
strengthening position on the part, of those
<:cmroltted Xo the speculative deal In wheat. i
Tht wheat t market was comparatively quiet j
io-<iay. but developments Â« there are. watched j
with .k<*en- attention- from the stock market |
point ; of' .view, owing i to the â¢ identity of exten- (
sive speculation, both in the wheat and the
etnek markets. . The. share taken by -this in
terest in the . bull . campaign â¢ which t has -been !
conducted In stocks Is variously estimated, and j
the extreme .estimates ; current," If they â¢ should 'â 
prove Justified. . would sufficiently explain the
uncertain tone of the present market. The sub
stitution In tfce Northern Securities directorate
for that of the head of the Union Pacific party
was belittled -on behalf of both sides to the old
quarrel in that property, Fears of an outbreak
of this. old quarrel- were emphatically, <JedarÂ»d â 
to be unjustified. - But the Wall street- view of
this matter has gone considerably â¢ beyond . a
mere' cuiet-inr -cf the , old ' , dispute â : and has
adopted, a yin- of thorough harmony and , co
operation In going forward to new projects of
Â«-yen t Zargev scope than even ; those ,-. of -, the
pant.'' There has been unquestionably speculs
- . tlon in stock*- based"" on. this view. and the
*" rkth-r . curt manner of â  yesterday's action -of
the directors shake? the confidence held in that
cuopoettlon. " Definite news from the hostile
1 fleets in the China seas was eagerly looked for,
and the possible outcome of the threatened sea
fight was a restraining Influence on the securi
ties market. Notwithstanding - the discussion
of the Northern Securities decision. Union Pa
cific was firm to strong all day. The other
principal points of strength were in the indus
trial list, notably Smelting, Amalgamated Cop
per and the Locomotive stocks. The weakness
of New York Central was a strong contrary
Influence and Illinois Central also suffered
fr -m free realizing on yesterday's % wide . ad
vance. ThÂ« electric stocks suffered on rumors
of a rupture of a working agreement and of
the expansion of competition in their field. A
sharp break In 'People's Gas was also an ef
fective Influence. An enthusiastic weekly re
view of the iron trade awakened a lively de
mand for United States Steel preferred, and
'< an active absorption of Union Pacific jat the
I same time carried the market upward to a
1 strong closing. '
Bonds were heavy. Total sales, par value,

â¢" CHICAGO, April â Bullishness was mani

Initltal 'quotations on May . were, up %c to lVÂ»c
at $1 1514 to $1 15%. '-' July .was unchanged to
a shade' higher :at 87% cto .87V4Â©87%c. Im
mediately after ' the opening 1 shorts ;;â¢ bid ;â . up
the- price of May ;to ' $1 16%. ; The . demand
was brought out by a rumor that a leader of
a Wall street clique Is Bald to control I a long
line of May WbÂ«at that had arrived in Chicago.
An intimation that the visit of * the Eastern
speculator might -. have - as ; an object r a further
squeeze in 1 May .wheat was the â  main -'â  cause
of ". the .' eudden ; advance *in â¢ .- the * price â - of 'â -â  that
option. On : the ; sharp upturn s offerings were
liberal. and I the price quickly reacted to !$1 15.
FirmneeÃ of distant futures was due - largely
to higher 1 prices at Liverpool. Cold * weather
â  in :' the ' Northwest ; also : had - a I bullish 1 effect.
Later the market received additional strength
I from I a report by a Minneapolis : crop : expert
alleging I that the â¢ Government crop .report . re
. cently ._.â  Issued < is ' altogether ".: | too > optimistic.
Damaging *Â reports were - - also f. received .- from

rael CJive Startling Fig
ures in Briefs Against
fcitro Will Trust Clause
ASK FOR DISTRIBUTION
Say One Twenty-Fifth of
Land in City Is Tied Tp
utrary to Public Policy
From the Ma^na Charta to the con
stitution of California the argument
of counsel reaches in the action insti
tuted by the heirs of the late Adolph
Sutro to declare invalid the trust
clause in the laat will of the departed
millionaire. 4Thla argument iÂ« con
tained in briefs filed for Judre Cof
fey's cogitation, "durins the vacation
period when all others are enjoying
themselves." says the court- Bishop,
\Theeler A Hoefler and J. F. Bowie of
counsel are the authors, the briefs
being In support of their motion for
distribution to the heirs of the vast
reaJty holdings of the estate.
The lands tied up in the trust clause
of the will, it is stated In the briefs,
comprise one twenty-fifth of the total
acreage of the city and county Â«>f San
Francisco and one-fifth of the land of
the city and county that is neither
covered by dwellings nor embraced
within municipal or Federal reserva
tions for park and other purposes. The
trust clause, it is further set forth.
restrains absolutely the alienation of
all these lands until such time after
the death of the last of the six sur-
Tiving children of the testator as the
trustees deem a release would be to
the best interests of the heirs.
Thie effort to restrain for an indef
inite period the alienation of such
larr*? holdings. It is contended by
oounsel, is against public policy and
In support of this contention section
3 of article IT of the constitution,
which is as follows, is quoted:
"The holding of large tracts of land,
Uncultivated and unimproved by indi
viduals or corporations is against pub
lic interest and should be discouraged
by ail means not inconsistent with the
rights of private property."
Here i 6 one twenty-fifth of the en
tire acreage of this city about to be
withdrawn for perhaps half a cen
tury from any use whatsoever, say
the heirs, and they pray that the ef
fort of Adolph Sutro to preserve in
tact his lands for the use of another
generation be defeated as being in
conflict with modern ideas of prog
ress.
In an effort to determine the valid
ity of various devises of the late John
S. Doe counsel have also filed long
briefs. These will furnish Judge Cof
fey milh more vacation reading in
event those in the Sutro case do not
exhaust his entire time during his
supposed period of leisure.

CELESTIAL BOYS HORRIFY
CAUCASIAN LOAFERS.
Deluge Them With' Strange Liquid
Resultant Panic Suggestive of the Descent of
a Hawk Upon a Pigeon-House.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
While historic Portsmouth Square
v>as bathed in midday sunshine and
tattered masculinity on the benches
snatched siesta, the spirit of mischief
entered the Christianized souls of
Wong Suey and Louie Him. thirteen
year-old native sons, and the result
was panic. Slyly attaching a long gar
den hose to a convenient hydrant, the
two youths turned on the faucet and
then directed the nozzle fairly and
fully at the slumbering loafers. It was
a forceful stream. Caucasian witnesses
of the deluging: informed Police Judge
Mogan. and If It had consisted of vit
riol instead of aqua pura the effect
could not have been more electrifying
upon those against whom it swished.
In an instant the atmosphere was
laden with profane expletives and the
sward dotted with indignant men vig
orously shaking from their garments
the strange liquid. Park Custodian
Gardener shut off the water and ar
rested the hose-bearers. â¢
"What did you do it for?" the Judge
asked the defendants.
"Me likee see sleepee go way," was
the answer of little Wong Suey.
"Me thinkee washee glood fo' bum
mee." replied little Louie Him.
"Yep," rejoined Wong Suey; "bum
mee needee washee."
Officer Gardener testified that the ef
fect of the unlooked for douche on
some of its recipients was startling,
not to say alarming. One man sat
and contributed lachrymal moisture to
the general dampness, and another man
shouted "Fire!" as he ran and wrung
his saturated beard. The commotion
was suggestive of that created by the
appearance of a hawk in a fowlyard
or a bear's Invasion of a sheepfold.
Mr. Gardener opined that some of the
routed ones did not cease running until
they were as dry externally as they
were chronically perched within.
After exhaustively pointing out to
"Wong Suey and Louie Him the serious
ness of their offense and their unde
sirable fate if they persist in such un
lawful behavior, his Honor permitted
them to retire with their respective
parents.
After Bitting through the last "Par
sifal" performance and perforce inhal
ing its "reverential atmosphere," Ru
dolph Hagedorn, whose fame as an
adept ,slaughterer of beef cattle is not
confined to the Potrero district, drank
copiously of steam beer with intent to
cleanse his senses of the Wagnerian
thralldom and resume psychological
fitness for his labors in the abattoir.
The endeavor had not entirely suc
ceeded when he was arrested by Pa
trolman Skdly and booked for dis
turbing the peace at Third and Harri
son streets by shouting German words
in execrable tones.
"Was he trying to sing?" Judge
Mogan asked the policeman.
"1 didn't regard it as singing," was
the answer, "but he said it was. He
told me the tune was some kind of a
motiveâ the wrong motive I think he
called it â that a fellow named Bung
starter had sung at the opera."
"Nein!" exclaimed the defendant,
palpably shocked; "Id vas nod Boong
shtarder vod I salt â it was Boorg
shtailer. Und it vas not 'wrong mo
dif vat I salt, but 'Schwan modif. 1
Ach, id vas lofely moosic."
"Don't try it again until you're in
the slaughter house," was his Honor's
method of dismissing the case.

Edward Jackson, accused of stealing
a watch from a man in a saloon on
Jackson street, was defended by At
torney Jackson and Judge Fritz con
tinued the healing.
John Laumeister, hirsutely quail
fled to pose for a portrait of the late
Oom Paul Kruger, was given until
next Saturday to show Judge Caban
iss why he should not be severely
punished for cruelty to his wife and
August Arnold, his stepson. The fam
ily dwells In discord at 529 Hanover
avenue.

William Little, arrested for begging
from householders in the neighbor
hood of Oak and Octavia streets, pavo
his residence as 2557 Post street and
said he was driven to mendicancy by
inability to obtain employment and
earn food for his family. The com
plaining policeman testified that Mr.
Little clung to cash offerings and
threw away such food as was given
to him. and Mr. Little declared that
the only edible he thus disposed of
consisted of scrambled eggs, which
were defectively cooked and unpalat
able while cold. Then It was proved
that on two distinct occasions he had
been arrested for ill treatment of his
family and Judge Mogan promptly
gave him three months' imprison
ment.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Frank Skiffington attributed his dis
orderly behavior to unwonted absti
nence from intoxicants, and not to
overindulgence, as Judge Fritz might
suppose. He was arrested for disturb
ing Lenten services in a Roman Cath
olic church at Ocean View by acting in
a most, erratic manner, and he informed
the court that not since last Jnuary,
when he took a pledge to abstain from
drinking ardent spirits for one year,
had he touched, tasted or handled an
intoxicating beverage.
â¢That's what's the matter with me,"
he declared. "Fighting the craving for
whisky has turned mÂ» brain."
He was given twenty days in prison

to continue his combat with the rum
demon.
Philip Hackmeler, brawny and red
haired, utered a dismal howl when
Judge Mogan intimated intention to'
sentence him to six months' imprison
ment for having cruelly abused his wife j
and children.
"You're a bully." said his Honor,
with contemptuous glance at the blub- i
bering fellow, "and like all the bullies
you are a coward when confronted by
prospect of undergoing punishment."
The Hackmeiers live in a boarding- ]
house at 71 Sheridan place, and it was
on complaint of Julius Oppenheimer, a
fellow boarder, that the bully was ar- '
rested. Mr. Oppenheimer told of vari
ous acts of cruelty committed by the
defendant on those dependent upon him :
for sustenance, and an eight-year-old ';
son of the defendant corroborated the
testimony. The wife did not appear
in court because she was afraid to do
so, Mr. Oppenheimer explained.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Daniel Shea, arrested for battering !
Patrick Carr at Eighth and Folsom
streets, told Judge Mogan that he acted
in self-defense.
"I'm slandin' at de corner," he said,
"Wen a guy wid half a heat on comes
up an' punches me. Wot can I do but
hand it back to him?"
Mr. Carr more than corroborated the
foregoing by explaining that it was a
full heat he had on when he assailed
the defendant. "When I get in a few
drinks I'm scrappy," said Mr. Carr;
"there's no denyin' that. I guess I got
mine all right when this man hit me."
Mr. Shea triumphantly acquitted.
Harry Nolton, a bottler of beer, and
his wife. Marie, employed such en
dearing terms in their controversy be
fore Police Judge Fritz that every one
else in the courtroom assumed an ex
pression of weariness. When they ap
proached the altar Marie was a widow
with two adult sons, and Harry was
the father of two motherless young
sters. Marie's offspring objected to
the union, and when it was effected
despite their protest they made life
so unpleasant for their stepfather that
he removed his portion of the family
from 25 Morris avenue and took up
residence with his children at 110
Sixth street. It was agreed that he
should give Marie $10 a week for her
separate maintenance, but his neglect
to live up to the covenant resulted in
his arrest for disturbing the peace
when he went to visit her a few days
ago.
"He licked me because I would net
live with him," she told the Judg*.
"Now, Marie, deary, you know that :
ain't so," Harry expostulated.
"Henry, dear, you know I'm no
liar," she retorted sweetly.
"How can you say such a thing,
honey, when you know I love vo:i,"
the man protested.
"That's all right, pet, but you know
you struck me â you know you did,"
the woman Insisted.
"Darling, you know your Â«!oris are !
the cause of all our trouble, now don't
you?"
"No, lovey, I can't say â "
"Case continued till to-morrow," ;
shouted his Honor, in tone denoting I
desire to rest.
As the husband pleaded, his long
face was tensely drawn and his eyes
protruded until, as Clerk Duffey re
marked, they were serviceable for ,
hatpegs. In the matter of looks the
wife had much the better of it, as she
was buxom and comely of counte
nance.
H. Boynton, who owns ranches In So
lano County that yield him an Income
of $10,000 per annum, boasted of his
ability to pay for whatever offense he
had committed when a policeman ar
rested him for disturbing the peace at
Kearny and Commercial streets. Judge
Mogan ordered that he be kept in cus
tody until he is sober enough to realize
that even a Rockefeller cannot violate
with Impunity the ordinances made and"
provided for the preservation of the
public peace in this town.
It was stated that at various times
Mr. Boynton has contributed in fines
and bail forfeitures a total of $2500 to
the treasury of Sulsun and that on
several prior occasions he has enriched
this municipality by paying cash pen
alties for misdemeanor.

WINS FIGHT
AND CARRIES
CHILD AWAY
Dr. E. H. Porter, After Bitter
Struggle, Succeeds in Elud-
ing Pursuers and Retains
Possession of Daughter
CONTRACT SUBGEON
GAINS HIS VICTORY
Despite Efforts of Dissolute
Mother Father Manages to
Get Girl on Transport
and Sails Away to Manila
After many trials and tribulations
Dr. Ellas H. Porter, contract surgeon
U. S. A., has evidently managed to get
his little 12-year-old daughter out of
this country and away from the hands
of itÃ mother. The fight for the child
has been a bitter one. Dr. Porter, how
ever, has apparently come out victori
ous, as he sailed away with hia little
girl for the Philippines on the transport
Thomas, which left this port March 31.
Dr. Porter, in his presentation at his
case here to the army officials, said
that v hen he returned last year from
the Philippines and went to his home in
Cincinnati, Ohio, he found his wife con
sorting with another man. The man in
question, he said, was a cook, and a
cook in a place of not the most savory
repute. He found his little girl there
in this same place. He immediately
took the child away. He says he at
once began proceedings for a divorce
and that when the presiding Judge
heard the conditions of the case he was
at once given a divorce. The court
awarded the custody of the child to
the father.
Dr. Porter says that a great fight en
sued on the mother's part to regain
possession of the child. Dr. Porter came
to San Francisco early in February,
bringing his daughter with him. He
made an attempt to sail away to the
Philippines on the 28th of that month.
In the meantime Mrs. Porter and her
partner had rushed out to the coast
to put a stop to the proceedings. Porter
was afraid to make an attempt to get
away on that date and with his little
daughter went to the discharge camp
at Angel Island, where they remained
in seclusion. Mrs. Porter in the mean
time put detectives on the Jrack, but
evidently the whereabouts of the hid
ing couple was not ascertained, as they
were not molested while . on the
island. ,Â»
Mrs. Porter, it is reported, says that
Dr. Porter did not get a divorce from
her, but that he took the child away
by main force.
When the transport Thomas sailed
on March 31 Dr. Porter decided he
would make a bold stroke. He knew if
he attempted to board the vessel the
morning that she was scheduled to sail
detectives would be on the dock
and with a writ of habeas corpus would
try to prevent him from taking the
child away with him. To circumvent
any such contingency it was arranged
that Dr. Porter and the child should
go on board the transport the evening
before. This was done and the couple
quietly stowed themselves away some
where on the ship, where they were
hidden from view until the transport
had glided out through the Golden
Gate.
The couple were so carefully con
cealed that the sergeant of the chief
of staff of the medical department
United States army could not locate
them when he visited the transDort the
morning she sailed. Colonel John D.
Hall, chief surgeon, Department of
California, in speaking of the case
said: "I don't kiow whether Dr. Por
ter got a divorce from his wife' or not.
I know that he bears an excellent
reputation, as he served under me in
the Philippines. He was efficient in
his duties there. He stood in erood
favor of his brother officers in the
islands. The arrangements for his go
ing away were made prior to my being
in command of this office here. I was
at the transport Thomas the day she
sailed, but I did not see Dr. Porter or
his daughter on board. He was
scheduled to Bail and his reservations
were made. I suppose on account of
the conditions of affairs he kept In
hiding."
It is reported that Mrs. Porter was
on the watch on the dock on the morn
ing of the sailing, accompanied by a
detective armed with papers to hold
her daughter here.
The Thomas is now on the way from
Honolulu to Manila. So the next step
to be taken by Mrs. Porter to recover
her child will have to be made when the
ship arrives at that port.

GOSSIP IN CAMP
OF POLITICIANS
Election in San Bernardino
Is Announced as Victory
for Steve Kelley's Forces
INCIDENTS OF THE FIGHT
Governor Pardee Considers
Long List of Applicants
for State Mineralogist
Steve Kelley still holds the works
in San Bernardino County and there
are indications that he will be able
to deliver the goods in the campaign
of 1906. He won out at the recent city
election through the agency of a non
partisan ticket. It was planned that
the Republican Committee should not
call a convention to nominate a city
ticket, but minority members of the
committee met, filled vacancies, called
a convention, nominated candidates
and demanded that the nominees
should be placed on the official ballot
under the regular party designation.
The City Clerk in the face of a deci
sion of the State organisation of the
party, that the minority members of
the committee had the right to fill
vacancies on the committee and call a
nominating contention, refused to act,
and did not put the ticket on the ballot
until the Supreme Court issued a writ
of mandate in which the ruling of the
State organization was sustained.
The opponents of the Kelley faction
fancied the victory was won when the
court recognized the right of a minor
ity of a committee to present the party
organization, but the voters of San
Bernardino expressed the opinion that
the ticket presented by the minority
members of the local Reoublican or
ganization represented the machine
element in politics. The result of the
election in San Bernardino is not con
strued as an indorsement of Speaker
Prescott's course In the Senatorial
contest at Sacramento.
The term of office of L. E. Aubury,
State Mineralogist, expired February
23 last, and there is gossip in mining
and political circles to the effect that
his successor will soon be chosen.
The appointing power resides with the
Governor, but the wishes of the Board
of Trustees of the Mining Bureau are
generally considered. Word comes
from Sacramento that the Governor
has a long list of applications on
file. Among the applicants are W. A.
Storms, Louis Janin Sr.. Harold Fair
banks, W. H. Turner, D. Loudertmck
and others. The Trustees would not
be surprised if the Governor should
go outside of the list of applicants
and select E. H. Benjamin for the
place.
