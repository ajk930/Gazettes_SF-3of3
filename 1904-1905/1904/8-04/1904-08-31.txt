5rÂ«3Â»i Disraich to The CÂ»:i,
The theory is that Marx drugged his
victims- when they pressed him too
hard for their wages and then crushed
their head3 with an ax, after which
the bodies were dismembered and
buried. Each of the bodies already
found bears a hole in the forehead.
The missing peddler went to the Marx
home with a large quantity of articles,
including clothing, cheap jewelry, etc..
and was never seen again. A few days
after this Marx tried to sell a miscel
laneous collection of. clothing to a
neighbor. /
The two bodies for which the search
was begun to-day are those of an
eighteen-year-old boy and a Hebrew
peddler.
The boy, who was known as Harry,
arrived in New York from Russia about
three years ago and he came here
soon after to work for Marx. Ha
worked on the farm about six months
and then suddenly disappeared. Marx
said he had gone to Hartford to find
employment. The Hebrew peddlerwent
to the Marx home 'one evening two
years ago and he has not been seen"
since.
The motive for the crimes can only
be traced to a desire on the part of
Marx to escape paying money to per
sons to whom he was Indebted. The
two men whose bodies have been found
were six months behind in their wages,
as was the young boy Harry, of whom
no trace has yet been found.
COLCHESTER, Conn., Aug. 30.â The
discovery of a second body on, the farm
of Gershon Marx, the octogenarian
farmer of this town, who is in tha
Norwich Jail, charged with the murder
of Joseph Paroll in April last, leads
the police fcere to believe that other
victims of the old man's temper are
buried on the place. The State Attor
ney will order the entire farm plowed
up in a search for more bodies.
For several days Alphonse Grant, In
terpreter for the New London court,
has been searchingrfor the body of Tom
Palm, who he knew disappeared from
the farm a year ago last October, rfit
that time Marx told his friends that
Palm had been paid off and had gone
back to the old country.
About a mile from the house yester
day afternoon Gi*ant came upon a spot
in the woods where the underbrush
seemed less bushy than elsewhere and
showed signs of having been disturbed
within a year or two.
He began to dig and soon he struck
layers of stones. Removing these he
struck soft earth, underneath which
he found the dismembered body of a
man tied up in a sack.
A similar sack was found around
the body found in the cellar on tha
Marx farm in April last. The head,,
arms and legs of the victim had been
cut off and there was little left of tha
man but the bones. From the clothes
the body was identified by Sheriff
Jackson as that of the missing Palm.
Four murders and an attempt to
poison another man can, it. is believed
by the officials, be traced to Marx.

LI AO YANG, Aug. 30. â The Japanese artillery fire ceased at 8 o'clock this evening. All attempts to turn the Russian flank were repulsed. The Third Russian Corps repelled

than six times. Two Japanese companies which succeeded in occupying a Russian position were mistaken for Russians and annihilated by Japanese artillery fire.

The Russian retreat from Anshan
shan was ordered for strategic reasons,
practically no resistance being of
fered. A light scree* of batteries fac
ing the Japanese guns, beautifully dis
posed on a chain of hills, marked the
withdrawal of the main' force.
When night fell the batteries also
took up the retreat, their rear guard
lighting bivouac fires to conceal the
movement. But the Japanese soon dis
covered this ruse and pressed forward,
coming up with the Russian rear
guard on Sunday morning. For an
hour the light batteries were hotly en
gaged.
To the lot of the Omsk, Tobolsk and
Krasnoyarsk regiments fell the duty of
covering the retreat of General Zarou
baleff's Fourth Siberian Army Corps.
The task was difficult, as the enemy
continued to advance, deploying light
mountain guns against the Russian
rear and left flank, and It was impera
tive that the enemy should be held
back to permit the removal of the bag
gage and artillery trains. The rails
were washed out and heavy with mud
produced by the deluge of rain preced
ing Friday. Many guns were mired
and the horses exhausted.
Cossacks and Infantrymen were har
nessed to the guns and managed to
haul them along. It was slow work,
but was successfully accomplished.
The greatest difficulty of the retire
ment on the east front was exper
ienced before Vanbantal Pass, where it
was necessary to hold the Japanese in
check until the artillery transport
passed through, and also to keep in
touch with the Tenth Army Corps,
commanded by General Herschelmann,
to the north, as well as with the south
ern divteon. In order to prevent a turn
ing movement.
From dawn until dark the eastern
troops, although fatigued by four days'
fighting, sustained a rear-forward
action.
LIAOYANG, Monday, Aug. 29.â
Throughout August 27 and 28 the Rus
sian eastern divisons continued to fall
back in good order on Liaoyang, but
the movement was slow on account of
bad roads and the difficulties of trans
portation, and the Japanese pressed
closely several times with light batter
ies, dragging guns to the hills and

PRI3IARIES IX THE SOUTH.
Although Murad is announced to have
died from diabetes, it has generally
been understood, according to the pal
ace reports, that he was suffering from
tuberculosis.
In ppite of the secrecy of Murad's
removal, he was seen as Le passed by
several foreigners, who declared that,
though he had aged and was haggard
in appearance, the former Sultan had
not lost his majestic bearing and that
he preserved the appearance of a man
in the fufl possession of his mental
faculties.
The confinement of Murad has bein
of the crudest character. . Only his
jailers were allowed to see him and
every precaution was taken to prevent
any intelligence of what was going on
in the outside world from reaching
him.
It was reported in May last from
Vienna that Murad V, the thirty-third
sovereign of the house of Osman, was
dying and at the same time it was re
ported from the tame source that his
adherents all through Turkey, known
as the Young Turks, were secretly
arming and only awaited the signal to
arise in insurrection*!
Murad V was burn in 1S40 and as
cended the throne after the murder of
the Sultan Abdul Aziz in Ma>, â¢ 1876.
In July of that year Murad was placed
under the regency of his brother, the
present Sultan Abdul Hamid II, and
August 31 he was dethroned. Outward
ly, this act was legally performed by
the Council of Ministers on the ground
that he was insane. The real facts in
the case, however, probably will never
be known, but it has been asserted that
Murad was a good deal more sane than
his brother, and one o-f the greatest
terrors of Abdul Hamid's existence was
the fear that this Turkish "man with
the iron mask," as he has been termed,
might escape from his place of con
finement in the Chera Gan Palace, and
some six years ago he was confined to
the Malta Kiosk in the grounds of the
Yildiz Palace, occupied by Abdul
Hamid, which is surrounded by lofty
walls.
Southern California, and especially
Los Angeles County, is sending on a
great deal of fruit. At the very front
of the California horticultural display
are two large stands given over to Los
Angeles and San Bernardino counties.
The principal exhibits on these are ap
ples and citrus fruits. Inside Los An
geles and other southern counties have
displays everywhere, which show the
horticultural wealth of the State!
Los Angeles in her display in the
Palace of Agriculture does not stop at
showing a profusion of products, but
makes a etrong appeal to the artistic
natures of such visitors as have them,
and probably arouses some artistic sen
timents in people normally without
them, and thus keeps up her reputation
as a show place worth the expense of a
Visit. Such displays as this county
makes at expositions doubtless attract
many visitors. New industries of an
artistic sort are advertised in the dis
play. Crystallized candied, rose leaves
are among the articles that hold the at
tention of women. They almost vie
with the ostrich feathers. Citron of a
size and appearance never found in Im
ported cases occupies another plate
glass compartment. Kernels of nuts
are displayed on dainty dishes in a
Â¦ way that tempts visitors to break the
! glass in order to get at them. Golden
globes of honey glow at the top of the
booth. Los Angeles does well her part
in the general effort to show the beau
ties and riches of California,
The most noticeable recent display
at the horticultural building was that
of Calimyrna figs. These were sent by
George C. Roeding and constituted the
first successful shipment of fresh figs
ever made to the East. They were sent
by express in crates with ice tanks in
the center, and reached St. Louis in
fine condition. The luscious display
held the attention of many, visitors and
members, of the jury covering this line
of display took samples that they might
prove to their satisfaction by analysis
the truth of the statement that these
figs contain more sugar than the Smyr
na article.
San Joaquln County has sent some
of the finest peaches seen here yet.
They are from the orchard of J. W.
Dougherty of Lodi. Some of them were
placed alongside the big ones in the
jars at the San Joaquin exhibit as a
refutation of the statement often heard
from Eastern people that the jars mag
nify their contents. â¢
R. E. Wilholt of Stockton has sent
some Kelsey plums and C. R. Smith of
Woodbridge some pears that cannot be
surpassed, and the few dishes of them
shown hold a circle of admirers about
them. 1
Grapes are slow in arriving. One day
there was one solitary bunch on exhibi
toin, Los Angeles being the 'exhibitor.
It is expected that a fine showing of
table grapes will be made later. Grow
ers do not care to send a great quan
tity of their first grapes to the fair, as
prices are high when the first ones
ripen. Some big clusters of fresh to
kays, muscats and black table grapes
like those shown in jars will make the
exposition visitors think that grapes
grow in California.
SOUTH TO THE FORE.
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING, WORLD'S FAIR GROUNDS. ST.
LOUIS, Aug. 30. â Receipts of fruits
for prize competition to date show that
California is not keeping up to hej*
horticultural standard at this exposi
tion. She will doubtless carry off all
the prizes in this line, as no other
State can compete with her, even
when she is not ait her best, but a bet
ter effect could be made on the gen
eral public if more enthusiasm were
shown by growers in the Golden State
and more and bigger fruit sent on.
Some contributions of very fine fruit
are being made, it is true,. but there is
much that- doesn't show the best Cali
fornia can do and in- no case are the
quantities sufficient to make the im
pression, on sightseers that California
can make. ''..
The reason, for. this apathy is not
known, but apathy seems certainly \p
exist. The poorer quality of material
sent is due to the fact that this is
something of an off year for fruit in
California. In the northern section
there were storms and drought af
flicted the southern portion. '
The State of California should pay
the expense of shipment and the grow
ers should contribute enough fruit to
make it possible to give away carloads
of it at the fair. It is not the peach
or the apricot or plum that some indi
vidual eats that counts when such dis
tribution Is made, but the fact that
every person goes home and talks
about California's peach or apricot
day at the fair and the fact that a
whole carload of whatever fruit is dis
tributed was given away. It is one of
the incidents of their visit that they
remember, even If they were not pres
ent to partake, for the news of such
a distribution goes all over the fair
grounds and is heralded in the exposi
tion city papers and those of other
cities,
FIGS FROM FRESNO.
BY PAUL EDWARDS.
SHANGHAI, Aug. 30.â A revival of
"Boxerism" is reported from Tamingfu,
in the southwestern part of Pechili
province, 215" "miles ' from * Tientsin:
More than twenty American
aries, including, women andf.children,
have been obliged 1 to leave, .Ta
mingfu, owing to- an intended massacre
by "Boxers," who call themselves
''Tsaiyun." â¢
The local telegraph company refused
to transmit a message from these' mis
sionaries to Minister Conger at Peking.
Fortunately, however, 5 an English
friend in Honan forwarded their mes
sage, whereupon Yuan Shih Kai, .vice
roy of Pechili province! dispatched,ur
gent orders for their protection.
In view of the fact that ..the local
authorities gave them no protection
and there- was no hope of continuing
their work, the missionaries all came
o-ut.: They, traveled fn' safety.
Grave doubts are felt In. some quar
ters here as to the real intentions of
Tie Hiang, who is at present absent
from Peking on a visit to the southern
provinces. ; A similar mission under
taken by Kang Yi before the last
"Boxer" -rising is recalled.
In his complaint Robertson recites
the events that occurred on June 6 last,
when he was compelled to resign. Soon
after the Independence explosion, he
declares, he was induced to enter Ar
mory Hall, where a large number of
mine owners were congregated. The
doors were immediately locked and a
guard placed on them. Then he was
informed that unless he resigned as
sheriff he would be killed. He demurred
and a rope with a noose was shown to
him and he was informed that unless
he resigned quickly the doors of the
hall would be opened and the mob per
mitted to enter and lynch him. He re
signed in order to save his life.
Informations were filed before Dis
trict Judge Lewis to-day charging
Rev. T. S. Leland. L. E. Jenks and Ar
thur Parker with a conspiracy to mur
der Sheriff Edward Bell and Deputy
Sheriff Underwood. These cases are
based on the shooting from Leland's
house on** Sunday night when Sheriff
Bell demanded admittance. Bail was
fixed at $2500. The accused are still in
jail.
E. S. Holden, former secretary of En
gineers' Union No. 75, was brutally

The first of the promised actions by

the court to oust Edward Bell from the
office of Sheriff and assess J5000 dam

CONSTANTINOPLE, Aug. 30.âFor
mer Sultan Murad V died yesterday of
diabetes, from which he had long suf
fered. His body was interred to-day
in the Yenidjami Mausoleum at Stam
boul, where his mother is buried.
Frequent efforts to dislodge and break
up the band proved of no avail until
two weeks ago, when the desperadoes
began attacking and looting the
ranches around Matape. The presi
.dente of that town organized a pursu
ing party, composed of rurales and vol
unteers, and they surrounded the ban
dits at the Burrola ranch. The rene
gades succeeded in fighting their way
out and all escaped with the exception
of their leader, who fell wounded in a
hand-to-hand conflict with one of the
Mexican rurales.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HERMOSiLlo. Mexico, Aug. 30.â
Frederico Cortes, the Mexican bandit
chief, who at the head of a desperate
gang . had raided and robbed the
ranches around Matape, Sonora, "was
taken into Urcs Saturday last and
placed in the prison there, according to
advices just received by stage from
that point.
Cortes and his men, who It is said
number thirty, made their headquarters
in the Sierra Madres, from which they
swooped -down on their excursions for
plunder. For some time depredations
committed by Cortes and his followers
were attributed to Yaquis, but on one
occasion a trader attacked by the
bandit king succeeded in escaping and
the authorities learned of the existence
of the band. Cortes at first wiade it a
business to leave no survivwr to tell the
story of his depredations, but after sev
eral escaped he made no effort to con
ceal his identity.
"The prosperity of this country is
greater than ever before. The vrork
ingmen of Vermont know that wag -3

than In any other country on earth.
During the last three years of Mr.
Cleveland's administration 3,000,000
laborers were Idle. If Judge Parker 13
elected this fall these conditions are
likely to return. Parker was frank
enough to tell us In his speech of ac
ceptance that If elected he would at
tempt to reduce the tariff.
"The common people believe Roose
velt and every State "from the Alie
ghanies to the Pacific slope will cast
its electoral vote for him in November."
Wilson declared that the only danger
to be avoided was that of apathy oa
the part of the Republicans.

to-day. The Boston Knights left this
evening for San Francisco, where they
will attend the Grand Conclave. The
New Haven Commandery left the train
at The Dalles and came to Portland by
boat in ord^r to view the Columbia
River scenery. They will remain over
until to-morrow night.
Entertained at Portland.
The St. Francis Hotel and some of
the larger business houses facing the
square will have brilliant illuminations
ornamenting their structures. Open air
concerts will be given In the center of
Union square every evening during the
conclave.
Union square will be illuminated for
the Knights Templar conclave, but not
bo extensively as was originally
planned. It will be attractive, however,
considering the Illumination of the
square and of the builidings facing it.
Twenty-four masts, about thirty feet
high, painted white, will be placed
around the park. From the top of each
pole will float an eight-foot American
flag, at the base of which there will be
a cluster of electric lights. Five feet
below the cluster of lights will be a
battery of smaller flags. Ten feet above
the sidewalk there will be clustered
about each post a battery of green palm
leaves forming the basis of garlands
of green, which will be twined about
the posts to the top.
Strings of electric lamps will be sus
pended between the posts, thirty feet
above the sidewalk, in graceful loops,
encircling the park in rows of brilliant
lights. Varicolored Japanese lanterns
will be ssupended from the wires and
loops at regular intervals to the num
ber of 250, each Illuminated by an elec
tric bulb.
At each of the four entrances to the
park a huge Japanese lantern, six feet
high 'and containing a cluster of elec
tric lights, will be suspended. This sort
of illumination and display is entirely
novel.
Novel Scheme of Illumination Is Sub

some September weather.
JÂ»nÂ»fo*or McAdJe Issues Statement
Covcrins Thirty-Three Years.
The weather will be an interesting
topic in connection with the two con
claves to be held here during the
month o, f September. In answer to
many inquiries the local weather bu
reau has a statement of condi
tions in September for the last thirty
three years. This, of course, is not to
be construed as a sure forecast of the
â¢weather conditions for the coming
month, but may be accepted as a rea
sonable basis of prophecy.
For the period mentioned there has
been an average of 61 degrees, the
warmest month occurring in 18S9,
when the thermometer averaged 65
degrees. The coldest September av
eraged 53 decrees, in 1S83. The hot
test September day occurred on Sep
tember 22,. 1S94, and the coldest on
the 30th, 1900. The rainfall for the
month has averaged throughout the
period .29 of an Inch, while for six
years of the period no rain at all fell.
The average is 14 clear days, 12 part
ly cloudy days and 4 cloudy days. The
average velocity of the wind was 10
miles an hour, although on September
27. 3 899 a gale blew from the west at
the rate of 4<* miles an hour.
Accident Narrowly Averted.
The work of installing the illumin

Committee Meeting Called.
At a special meeting of the retail
merchant members of the Merchants'
Association, held to consider what ac
tion would be desirable in regard to
closing their places of business during
the week of the Knights Templar con
clave, it was decided that, inasmuch
as this would be an unusual occasion,
the large number of visitors to the
city during the first part of the week
could be better accommodated, and the
city made more attractive, if the re
tall stores were kept open Monday and
Tuesday, except during the hours of
the parades. The following resolution
was unanimously adopted:
"Resolved, That It is the sense of
this meeting that the retail stores in
San Francisco should .be kept open
on Monday, September 6, and Tuesday,
September 6, and close on Friday, Sep
tember 9, and that during the hours
of parades on Monday and Tuesday
stores, at their discretion, should close
in order to allow their employes time
to view or participate In the parades."
The association requests that all re
tail stores in the city will, so -far as
possible, conform to this recommenda
tion, in order to secure uniformity of
action.
The citizens' committee, formed for

here and there were golden candelabra
holding candles surmounted by rose
tinted silken shades. Soft music rip
pled forth from a stringed orchestra,
hidden behind a screen of tall ferns.
The menu was elaborate, and served
In excellent style, and was accompa
nied by a sparkling flow of White Rock
and Castle Hock mineral waters. These,
with coffee, were the only beverages in
evidence. Wines of all kinds were en
tirely excluded, in accordance with the
recent rulings of the grand masters of
the order.
Among those present were seventy
eight members of the Louisville Com

marks were concise and to the point.
After a general speech of welcome he
presented to the guest of the evening,
on behalf of the California Comman
dery, a magnificent sword with massive
golden scabbard and superb jeweled
hilt.
Grand Commander Pierce, in accept
ing the beautiful token, said he would
always wear it in a symbolical manner
to protect the widow and the orphan,
and to protect the great Christian re
ligion.
Grand Captain General William B.
Melish of the Grand Encampment of
the United States was very happy in
his remarks, which were decidedly of a
jocular character. Speeches were also
made by Post Commander Heppner of

A telegram has been received by H.
C. Wyau, the local theatrical manager,
from the Public Administrator of Chi
cago askir.s him to take charge of the
body and personal effects of Mrs. J. H.
McVicker at Pasadena. Wyatt has
been acting as the representative of
th<* stepson of the deceased, Howard
McVicker, since the death of Mrs. Mc-
Vicker, and ordered the holding of the
eutopsy over the body, which took
place a couple of days ago. Wyatt

LOS ANGELES, Aug. SO.â Dr. Zeigler

Man East with the body of Mrs. Mc-
Vicker as soon as a few preliminaries
are arranged. He expects to reach Chi
cago on Monday next. He states that
be h'-'s made arrangements for police
protection there, and will resist any ef
fort on the part of the Chicago rela
v.ves to gain possession of the body. He
inaracterizc-s the story from Chicago
of a shortage in the funds of the estate
as being entirely untrue.
A conference of the California rela
tlves of the deceased was held in the
offive of a local attorney here to-day,
and it is stated that it was decided to
m?fce a vigorous: contest for a share of
the McVicker estate.
CHICAGO. Augr. 20.â An analysis of
the .contents of Mrs. J. H. McVicker's
etornach is to be made Â«i Chicago. A
telegram to have the stomach brought
to this city was sent to Pasadena by
Horace McVicker. the stepson, to-day.

In accordance with her request Mc-

would indicate that the rumor that she
has joined the forces of Dr. Zeigler is
untrue.
Mrs. McVicker's will was opened and
read to-day. Neither Horace McVicker
nor any of the other persons present
at the readies of the will would dis
cuss its contents. A mutual agreement
has been made to keep the provisions
of the iv ill secret.
The heirs-at-law of the dead woman

CANANEA, Mex.. Auc SO.â Lem
Quiones, at the head of a score of pris
oners, made a desperate break for lib
erty at the prison at Ronulllo Sunday
evening. They were discovered and
overpowered Just as the first of their
number was emerging from a hole in
a wall on which they had been at work
for weeks, but which they had been
successful in concealing.
A man sleeping under the wall was
disturbed by the pushing away of the
thin wall which separated the prisoners
from libert/ and called to the guard,
who was around a corner.
Quiones had his head and arms
through th^ opening in the wall when
the guard covered him and ordered
him not to stir, threatening him with
instant death. Quiones dropped his
head first to the ground. The officer
fired a half-dozen times. He failed to
hit him, as the convict started off on
a zigzag course. By this time a half
dozen officers had assembled and
Quiones was surrounded and taken.
He Is under sentence to die on Sep
tember 1. He said that as a few days
made no difference he was ready to
take any chance.
His companions turned back when
the Mexican gondarme commenced fir-

hosts en route to the triennial conclave
at San Francisco began to arrive to-day
and by to-night more than 500 men of
nearly the highest rank In Masonry
were In Los Angeles. Many of them
had been delayed by washouts on the
railroad In Arizona and New Mexico,
and some of the special cars had been
kept back four days, but they arrived
here with only praise for the treatment
given them by the railroads and thank
fulness lhat the delay was no longer.
The experience of some of the com
manderies was anything but pleasant,
their trains having been blockaded by
washouts, and it was necessary to hold
their trains until miles of track could
be rebuilt before they could proceed.
If a hearty welcome to . California
will add to the success of the San Fran
cisco conclave the Los Angeles Knights
Templar are contributing to that suc
cess. Committees sometimes twenty or
more strong have been Bent out to meet
Incoming trains and give to the delega
tions aboard them a real California
greeting. These committees have taken
with them the choicest fruits of this
section and carloads of flowers, and the
belated Sir Knights who have been the
recipients of these favors were more
than delighted. At the Masonic Temple
to-night there was a public reception
on a scale never before attempted here.
Nearly 300 visiting Knights attended,
and until nearly midnight they were
entertained. Then it was announced
that the most eminent Knight of all the
eminent Sir Knights would arrive at
midnight, and it was decided that all
the visitors go to the depot to greet
him. When at nearly 1 o'clock the
train bearing Grand Master Henry
Bates Stoddard of Bryan, Texas, ar
rived and he stepped from his special
car, he was greeted by nearly 500 Sir
Knights in full uniform. The com
mander of all the Knights Templar was
so wearied from his journey that it
was out of the question to hold a re
ception to-night, and he was escorted
I to a special car and departed immedl
1 ately for Santa Monica, where he will
j spend the night. With him came the
officers of the Grand CommarwigEles of
Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi, and
they accompanied him to the ocean
town. To-morrow trains bearing dele
gations of Sir Knights are expected to
arrive at intervals of two hours, and
every member of the Los Angeles com
manderies will assist in the reception
of these guests.

"The center of our position Is lo

east. The fighting there was of the
most desperate character,- but is now
going on nearer at the flanks.
"The hissing of shells is distinctly
audible, and from the city it is easy
to see the sheila bursting.
"Heavy Runs were brought into ac

dull roar was discernible above the
sharper detonation of field and moun

"The Russians are using big ord

ring of the Liaoyang' forts.
"The noisy Chinese population has
suddenly become quiet. The main
street of Liaoyang, always the scene
of the busiest traffic and usually re
sounding with thousands of shrill
voices from sunrise to sunset, is now as
silent as If it were night.
"The inhabitants are watching the

Japanese evidently had numerous guns.

white smoke being distinctly traceable
against the dark foliage of the

heavy, especially to the regiments
which sustained bayonet charges.
All the men serving one Russian

9:25 o'clock this morning, said:
"What appears to be the deciding
battle began at 4 a. m. Since then the
artillery hag been thundering and rifle
fire has been rolling incessantly. The
encircling heights resemble fire-emit

the attack east of Liaoyang, along the
Taltse River, but were repulsed.
"The firing is now specially heavy
south and southwest of Liaoyang. One
can no longer distinguish individual de
tonations. The Wyborg regiment, of
which Emperor William II is honorary
chief, is deploying upon the battlefield.
The Rueslan army is full of confidence.
"The total strength of the combat
ants engaged is estimated at more
than a half-million men. The battle

days."
Colonel Gaedke, correspondent of the
Tagcblatt at Liaoyang, telegraphed to
his paper at noon to-day as follows:
"The battle has been in pro
gress since early dawn. The 'Russian
positions are on the heights surround
ing Liaoyang, making a semicircle of
about eight and a half miles from the
railroad to the upper Taitse River, and

SHRAPNEL TIRE IS DEADLY.
The Manchuria sailed yesterday for
Honolulu, China and Japan. Her cargo
measures about 13,000 tons, and more
than half of It is. for Japan. The total
cargo is valued at 55-0,692. In addition
she carries treasure valued at $941,631,
of which $SOO,000 is for Japan.
Her cargo for Japan is valued at
$35,413. and Includes 1243 rolls of leath
er, 1541 bundles of steel. 1405 steel bars,
402 bales of cotton. 929 bales of cotton
goods, 40,057 centals of barley, 17,100
pounds of tin foil and 230 packages of
machinery. She also has 35,500 barrels
of flour, consigned, however, to China.
The nature of the 239 packages of
machinery has been kept a profound
secret, but it is said that when this
shipment is unpacked and put together
by the Mikado's naval engineers the
result will closely resemble a submarine
boat. This boat is said to have been
purchased in Europe and was left on
the hands of the railroad when the Pa
cific Mail Company decided, in view of
the activity of the Vladivostok squad
ron, to go out of the contraband busi
ness. Subsequent Japanese victories
have cleared the seas of danger from
Russia, and the company does not an
ticipate any interference with the Man
churia.
Every cabin on the big liner was
crowded. The Manchuria carried about
forty passengers for Honolulu, and
among those bound for Oriental ports
were many missionaries.
Captain Saunders, commander of the
Paclnc Mail Company's new 13,000-ton
liner Manchuria, was a proud man yes
terday as his huge charge glided from
her berth, made a graceful swing just
far enough from the wharf end to be
cltar of danger and straightened out on
her course for the Golden Gate. It was
as pretty a departure as liner ever
made. It was 2one 'skillfully, and to
those of the crowd on the wharf who
were not weeping over a recent good
by the sight was most majestic. Any
fiallorman would have been proud of a
command that behaved so spendidly be
fore an audience. Superintendent
Hauxhurst looked pleased, and an al
most genial smile softened for a second
the face, of General Manager R. P.
Schwerin.
But the pride of Saunders will be as
nothing to the pride of the Russian
commander lucky enough to make a
prize of the $2,000,000 steamship and
her ?1.000.000 cargo. Should some sh!iÂ»
of the Czar's fleet encounter the Man
churia the Russian officers will find in
the liner's hold plenty excuse to inter
rupt her journey to Japan. A Russian
prize court would enjoy sitting on the
Manchuria, and there will be no "re
gret to report" In the message to the
father of the tiny baby colonel if the
Manchuria falls into the clutches of
the bear.

CHEFU, Aug. 20.â A junk which left

August 2i brings confirmation of the
report of fighting at l'alichuans on the

in holding their position and mount

in the vicinity of Taplngtze.

affirm that the Hussions are firing

forts. This may mean that there Is
another und<?stroyed fort at Etzshan,
*n that the Russians have recaptured
that position. One of the Chinese de
clares that he has been engaged for
tv\e:;ty days in carrying Russian dead
from the fort near Tapingtze.
The Port Arthur Novo Krai, in its
issue of August 2tJ. speaking of the in
cidents of the siege occurring between
August 22 and August 26, makes no
mention of any general assault during
that period, but records Beverardeeper
ate attacks on the Russian positions.
Following a grand three days' as
sault on the defenses of Port Arthur
the Japanese rested during the day
time of August 23. At 11 o'clock that
right they concentrated a strong force
to attack the Zareuoutni fort, which is
a strong position on the Russian right
flank. The Japanese made clever uss

The advance of the Japanese was
like that of a swarm of locusts. They

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 30. â Di
rect news from Lieutenant General
â¢StoeFsel, commander of the Russian
military forces at Port Arthur, up to
August 25, and of a favorable char
acter, has been received here. Gen
eral Stoessel's report soys that the
Japanese were repulsed on August 23,
with heavy loss to the attackers. He
gives no details of the positions held
or of the Russian losses in men, but
says the officers suffered severely,
especially the younger men. Some of
the larger Russian guns were placed
out of action by the Japanese batteries
and were replaced by field pieces.
The general describes the stench
from the decaying bodies between the
lines as being horrible. He reports
that the morale of the garrison is ex
cellent.
Port Arthur Commander Reports Re
pulse of Fresh Attacks.
WORD FROM BRAVE STOESSKL.
In tho vicinity of Louisa Bay, north
west of Port Arthur, the Japanese have
200 guns concealed in a cornfield.
The last issue received here of the
N'ovo Krai contains an account warmly
praising the conduct of Captain Lebe
dieff, oommanding the marines at Zare
doutni, who stood on top of a wall, his
revolver in one hand and his sword in
the other, and killed or wounded twen
ty odd Japanese, who, mounting on the
shoulders of their comrades, attempted
to scale the wall. When the Japanese
were repulsed Captain Lebedieff sat
down and was wining the perspiration
from his face when a shrapnel shell
tore his body to pieces.
During the night of the 25th Captain
Stempncffsky with a small force made
a sortie and attempted to disperse a
Japanese battery located on Corner
Hill, but without success. This sortie
was made from High Hill. The Nova
Krai adds that the Japanese were
building trenches In front of the hills
from Corner Hill to High Hill, but it
does not mention the retreat of the
Russians from the latter place. The
Japanese had about thirty guns, some
of them mounted In stone Chinese
houses and others in the foothills along
the beach.
The night of August 24 was quiet. On
the morning of the 25th the Japanese
artillery opened up along the entire
eastern front, but most severely on the
northern pection.
defenses, hut they were compelled to
retire with considerable loss.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the
24th the Japanese began a heavy bom
bardment of the Russian position with
their 120-millimeter guns', and at the
same time a Japanese column of infan
try and cavalry appeared at Pali
chuang. At 6 o'clock that afternoon
the Japanese furiously attacked the en
tire northeastern front of the Russian
Daylight found the belligerents in
that quarter engaged in an artillery
duel. General Gorbatowsky personally
directed the Russian fire, although he
had been six days and six nights with
out sleep. The .fort suffered consider
ably from the Japanese artillery, and
General Gorbatowsky ordered the gar
rison ipto undamaged trenches.
The next glimpse the Russians had
of the Japanese was at 10 o'clock on
the morning of August 24, when a
mountain battery on mules was seen
in motion. The Russians opened fire
on this battery and dispersed it.
At noon of the 24th two Japanese col
umns were observed, one behind Sugar
head. Hill and the other near the rail
road bridge, but they retired when the
Russian artillery opened upon them.
the enemy the Russian troops cheered.
The Japanese searchlights showed
ghastly heaps of dead, like magic lan
tern pictures.
The Japanese soon were reinforced
and recommenced the attack furiously,
but again they were repulsed. The
N'ovo Krai soberly asserts that the
Japanese troops were forced forward
by their own shrapnel fire, the guns
being placed behind them to prevent
a retreat.
A third attempt to capture the posi
tion also failed, and, anticipating a
fourth attack, 1 ' the Russians were rein
forced; but a fourth attack was not
made.
The Zarcdoutnl fortifications present
ed to the Japanese a high stone wall of
Chinese construction, and the fact that
one detachment succeeded in scaling it
is accounted marvelous.
The fiercest engagements of August
26 occurred at Hungshaling and
Kungshaling. The moonlight revealed
the Japanese troops as they advanced.

tions. lSesides opening a fierce rifle fire

position at Hungshaling. where they
captured eight guns which had pre
viously wrought havoc in their lines.
On the morning of the 27th,
through mists and haze, all three of
the Japanese columns moved forward.
The Russians resisted this advance
vigorously and it was nightfall before
the Japanese were in possession of
the long ridge. â¢
In the meantime the Japanese cen
ter hud pierced the Russian line, com
pletely dividing it, but both the Rus
sian wings held their positions firmly.
During the afternoon of the 26th a
great thunder storm broke over the
battlefield, covering the hills with mist
and preventing accurate use of the
guns. â¢
RUSSIAN LINE PIERCED.
The Japanese left column, the prin
cipal strength of which was in in
fantry, attacked an eminence north of
Tahsikou at dawn of the 26th. ThÂ©
Russian artillery was in peml-perma
nent fortifications north of Tatientsu
,and north-.vest of Kaefengsu and, in
strength, was superior to that of the
Japanese. This bombardment reached
its height between 2 and 4 o'clock in
the afternoon. The Russian fire dwin
dled at times, but the Japanese were
unable to silence the enemy's guns.
The Russian infantry was reinforced
and pressed against the left wing of
the Japanese left column. The Japan
ese troops here were dangerously ex
posed and the advance of the left col
umn returned.
The Japanese right column made a
night attack on Hungshaling, Chipan
llng and the Intervening positions. Its
left wing was successful, but the Rus
sians held A part of the position at
Hungshaling. A severe rifle and artil
lery duel opened at dawn and lasted
until dusk.
The Russian forces on the second and
third lines were then strongly rein
forced and offered determined resis
tance. A fierce rifle engagement en
sued sfnd continued without abatement
throughout the 26th. The Russian ar
tillery posted at Anping got the range
of the Japanese lines and sent in a
deadly fire. The Japanese artillery was
not able to secure good positions and
was badly exposed. The Russian in
fantry endeavored to recover its lost
ground, but the Japanese held their
positions and managed gradually- to
press the Russians toward the valley
of the Lan River.
TOKIO, Aug. 30.â Details of the oper
ations against Liaoyang from August
25 to August 28, which include an ac
count of. the desperate three days'
battle in the neighborhood of Anping
and the abandonment of Anshanshan,
reached Tokio to-day.
The first Japanese army was divided
into three columns and mc-ved against
1 Anping, where the Russians occupied
a steep and well fortified eminence,
which they had spent months in
strengthening. The Russian position
to the east and south of Anping ex
tended along a ridge north of Tai
shukou to Hungshaling, through Han-
PC-lln and Tatientsu. The advantages
were with the Russians. The Japanese
were not able to secure good positions
for their artillery, except along the
Liaoyang road.
The Japanese left column moved for
ward on August 22. driving back e
small force of Russians 1 , and on the,
25th took pusÂ£eiÂ»siun of a line on an
eminence north of Erhtaokou and
south of Pelingtzu. and prepared to
give battle tne following day. The cen
ter and right columns made their pre
paratory moves before the nigat of
the 2oth. At midnight of the 115th the
Japanese tenter suddenly rushed for
ward in a bayonet charge against the
Russian center, which was located in
the vicinity of Kungchangling. This
charge was a surprise and proved to
â¢be eminently successful. The Japan
ese captured the entire position.

A te'egram received here yesterday
from Manila announced that Second
Lieutenant Fitzgerald R. Turton,
Twenty-second United States Infantry,
had committed suicide in the Island of
Mindanao. The message gave no rea
son for his self-destruction and his
friends in army circles hfÂ»re are at
loss- for an explanation of his rash
act.
Lieutenant Turton was well known
In this city, where it was made known
yesterday that he was engaged to be
rnarried to Mrs. Donald IXcLeane, for
mer wife of Dr. McLeane of the United
States army, from whom she was di
vorced several months ago. Mrs. Mc-
Leane is now residing with her two
children In Mill Valley, where she was
apprised of Lieutenant Turton's suicide
late yesterday. She admitted that she
was betrothed to the lieutenant and
had planned to join him in Manila
next May, when they were to be mar
ried. The news of his death came as
a severe shock to the fair fiancee.
Lieutenant Turton was a native of
New Zeaiar.d. In the army he rose'
from the ranks io the position of a
commissioned officer. He first met Mrs.
McLeane early this year in the East
while she was visiting friends and
latf:r showed her much attention after
Fhe and her husband had separated.
Dr. rirLeane became addicted to drink
and was finally forced out of the army,
owing to his arrest on a charge of
th^ft. Through the efforts of his wife,
who is an attractive and accomplished

Captain Michael A. Healy, one of the
best known navigators of the Pacific,
ended his long and eventful career
shortly after 10 o'clock last evening,
when he passed, quietly away at the
Waldeck Hospital. Captain Healy had
been sick for some time, but his con
dition did not take a serious turn until
a few darvs ago, when he was advised
to go to the hospital. A failing heart
and a general breaking down of what
was once a robust constitution has
tened his end.
Few mariners who have traveled up
and down the coast could not boast
of an acquaintance with Captain
Healy, who, for many vears, com
manded the United States revenue cut
ter Bear and rendered valuable service
In the northern waters, where his duty
as guardian of the fishing industry and
sealing interests caused him to remain
for months at a time. He was a na
tive of Georgia, 65 years of age, and
was educated In France. When fifteen
years old he ran away to sea and trav
eled over the entire world In the mer
chant service, where he rapidly rose
from a cabin bo*' to the position of
captain. In 1S67 he entered the reve
nue service as a third lieutenant and
was made a captain about 18S4, finally
retiring In 1003, after fifty years of
nautical experience.
At Washington he was regarded as
one of the best informed mariners on
the coast and during his many years
in the north he was frequently called
upon to exercise his Judgment in mat
ters of national and International Im
portance that gained for him a world
wide reputation.
Captain Healv Is survived 'by a wid
ow and one. son, Frederick A. Heaiy, a
well known newspaper man. Since his
retirement from the revenue service
Captain Healy has resided with his
wife at the Occidental-. Hotel, where
he was a daily habitue of the lobby..
The. news of his death will be received
with a feeling of deep regret by a large
number of. friends "along the entire,
northern coast and by the natives of
Alaska, who looked upon him as their
protector through many trials and trib
ulations.. The funeral, for which the
date has not v yet been set. will take
place from St.- Ignatius j Church.
Captain Healy was. a brother of
Aichbishop Healy of Portland, Me., and

RETURNS TO THE PRESIDIO
The members of the Stablemen's
Union are very much disgruntled over
the action of the Hackmen's Union in
calling off the strike with the Stable
and Carriage Owners* Association
without even consulting any of the
stablemen's leading lights. It must be
trorne In mind that the Hackmen's
Union went out on sympathy when
the stablemen decided to strike. After
ward the hackmen became convinced
that they were not fairly treated by
the stablemen. Relations between the
two unions are how far from harmoni
ous. The internal workings of the Sta
blemen's Union are also the reverse of
harmony and brotherly love Just at
present. -
Like the barbers, who agreed to keep
open shop during the holidays next
week, the journeyman bakers have also
waived their'holiday rights out of con
sideration for the unusual number of
visitors coming into the .city during
next week. They will man their ovens
and dough troughs to keep the wolf
away from the hotel doors during tha
conclave. Concessions will be made by
the Master Bakers' Association to give
their help holidays as soon as the con
clave is over. f
Relations Between the Hackmen's
Union and the Stablemen Have
Been Jarred Severely.

That meeting on September 13 will be
fun". And 'tis said that the members
â¢Â»to are allied to lawyer-husbands
have given them strict instructions to
stay at their posts en the afternoon of
the engagement â lest the disputants
wander beyond their legal depth â and
to answer promptly a hurry call for
advice.
Meanwhile Architect Plssis is lying
Â£ ?.ake nights, lest he dream of the
clubhouse, with the 500 clubwomen
after hifti in full cry-
On : the heels oÂ£ this conies the in
formation that the president has dis
solved the building committee of fifteen
â without even a pension â as a body
that had outlived its usefulness. Many
*cf its . members, however, refuse to ac
cept her view and decline to dissolve,
insisting that they had served faith
fully and v.ell for thr^e years and that
as the work in hand is not complete
the committee could not be dissolved
at the wave of the presidential wand.
And thus the matter stands, while
whispers wander abroad that "there's
politics in It," and that the dissolving
process was a simple ruse to create a
cew building committee â although it is
univeiealiy admitted that many of the
ctror.gest women in the club were in
tfiat extinct body.

And It a!l came about so innocently
ard femininely. The club bought a
Joity-foot lot on Clay street some years
ago. which it unanimously agreed to
Improve. But how? There was the
Question. Should it be a clubhouse
Â¦worthy the dignity and prestige of the
California Club, or would It be a sort of
houseboat ashore?
.â¢Vfter many months of more or less
Intelligent discussion it was decided to
make the clubhouse fit the club â which
vas distinctly large and dignified. And
then the idea expanded into executive
ariion, the building committee and the
board of directors deciding to expend
520,000 in the construction, and to award
the plans to Architect Pissls â unhappy
day for Architect Pissis, who has been
nade to suffer through the beautiful
reil of his friends.
Before the motion had time to cool
It was carried into the open club at
a regular meeting, and the proposition
presented. With an amendment to raise
the turn to $35,000 the motion went
through with a zip â without even a
whimper from the members who are
now finding ail sorts of phantasmagori
al faults with the whole proposition.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 30.âRepre
sentatives from the ten local dairy as
sociations met to-day in the Senate
chamber for the purpose, of forming a
State Dairymen's Association.
Edward F. Schulz, secretary of the
San Francisco Dairymen's Association,
called the meeting to order. He Bpoke
on the objects and purposes of the as
sociations, and said that their object
was to combat such legislation as
would have a tendency to Injure the
dairying business as a whole.
George L. Perham of San RIateo
County was elected temporary chair
man and Edward F. Schulz temporary
secretary- ..,....:
Perham on taking the chair said that
a dairymen's association had been a
blessing- to the dairymen In the city
of San Francisco, and he thought that
if a local organization could benefit the
dairymen, certainly a State ; organiza
tion could be of much greater benefit
to the dairying interests.
. Samuel E. Watson read a report of
the proceedings of the old State Dairy
Association.
Secretary Schulz then read a commu
nication from the California Promotion
Committee, in which congratulations
were extended to the new organization.
The association was asked to help se
cure the national convention of butter
makers for San Francisco in 1905.
Chairman Perham then appointed the
following committees to perfect perma
nent organization:
On organization â George Hopping of
Woodland, Edward S. Babue, secretary
Dairymen's Association of Oakland,
and John D. Daly of San Francisco.
On resolutions â Samuel E. Watson of
Alameda, Albert Meister of Sacramen
to and J. L. Beecher of Stockton.
A recess was then declared for the
purpose of allowing the committees to
prepare their reports. After reconven
ing the committee on organization re
ported that the association be named
the California Dairymen's Association,
and that its object and purposes be to
secure the co-operation of local dairy
men's associations and county associa
tions, to be formed, and to promote the
social, moral and -business interests of
its members.
The following commlttea of five at
large was appointed for the purpose of
organizing the respective localities: M.
P. Hansen, Alton, Humboldt County;
A. B. Evans, Fresno; Samuel E. Wat
son. Alameda: J. L. Beecher, Stockton,
and J. R. Hebbron, Monterey.
The meeting then adjourned to call of
the chair.
The tbtal membership of the ten local
organizations is estimated at 1100.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ»> Call.
CHICAGO, Aug. SO.â A strong effort
is to be made by the leaders of the un
ions now at the stockyards to spread
the scope ot the strike so that it will
include every trade which is affiliated
in even a remote degree with the pack
ing industry. â¢
The first step in this direction was
taken to-night, when the stock hand
lers now employed at the yards voted
to so on strike at 10 o'clock in the
morning. There are about 1000 of these
men, and their duties are to look after
and feed the cattle in the pens between
the time of their arrival and the time
of their killing. Their action to-night
therefore will make it incumbent upon
the packers to provide other men to
take their places.
President Donnelly of the Butchers*
Union declared to-night that he would
also be able 'to call out all the switch
men employed on the railroads which
do business at the stockyards, and pos
sibly to extend the strike to other de
partments of the railroads.
A mass-meeting of the strikers is to
be held to-morrow afternoon at Watita
Hall, near the stockyards, at which ad
dresses are to be made by a number of
labor leaders.

By a unanimous vote the Master
Builders' Association put itself on
record to-night as being in favor of the
proposed bonds to be voted for the pur
pose of beautifying this city. A meet
ing for the discussion of this question
was held at the headquarters of the
association at 425 Fifteenth street, and
after a number of members had ex
pressed their views the meeting was
'addressed by Councilman Elliott, who
presented in brief outline the general
scheme of the proposed improvements.
The meeting waa addressed by J. "W.
Fisher of the Fisher Lumber Company,
I*. J. Brophy, Ben O. Johnson, W. E.
Gibson and A. G. Pillsbury. The gen
eral sentiment expressed was that the
Master Builders' Association should
put Itself on record as being in favor
of bonding the city in order to im
prove It and make it attractive for
home-seekers. Johnson called for a vote
upon this question and the entire as
semblage signiiied its sentiment' by a
rising vote without a dissenting voice.
Not only did the meeting result in
the association voicing its sentiment in
regard to the bonds, but those present
pledged themselves to do what they
could toward urging others to work for
the passage of the proposition. It was
the expressed sentiment that the ex
penditure of this money was absolutely
necessary for the proper growth of the
city. Fisher said: ,
"Unless we beautify th's city it will
not make the proper advance."
Brophy voiced the sentiment: "We
need have no fear of the present Coun
cil misspending this money."
Gibson predicted that in ten years the
population of California would be
doubled, and to get her share Oakland
would have to be up and doing. .
Pillsbury said: "The money we spend
now will all be returned to us, princi
pal and interest, by the enhanced value
of the property." "^

, In certain of the hop-growing sec
tions of California the hop aph!s Is at
times a serious menace to the industry.
Owners of hop yards dread the appear.
ance of these malicious little insect.*,
well knowing that if they Increase
great losses will result. Instances have
been known where the value of the
crop was reduced nearly one-half bs
eause of the ravages of the aphis.
But the aphis will bother the hop
growers no more after this, becausa
th^agricultural department of the Uni
versity of California haa settled its ca
reer. Experiments conducted by War
ren T. Clarke of the entomological de
partment show that the insect can be
exterminated by the use of a very sim
ple spray, so that it may be usherei
out of existence before It passes even
the baby age.
The spray that was so successful in
dealing death to the aphis consists of
a tobacco decoction and a kerosene
emulsion in combination. It doesn't
Â¦cost much per gallon. and is so effective
that the insects were under complete
control after a short trial. The details
of Clarke's success are contained In a
bulletin issued at the university to-day.

the University of California, upon
which it was purposed to connect a
welcoming sign to the freshman class,
were given their freedom in the pres
ence of three attorneys and a Judge
this morning in the Justice's Court
after a brief examination.
Charles E. Snook, â¢ representing the
Board of Regents; District Attorney J.
J. Allen and Town Attorney Brewton
A. Hayne and Judge Robert Edgar sat
in judgment upon the accused. In the
face of this preponderance of legal tal
ent the students quailed at first, but
they revived when they looked around
and saw that they had the moral sup
port of a courtroom full of their fel
lows, including one or two center
rushes and halfbacks. The legal lights
of the bar talked it over in the Jus
tice's chamber for a while and then
emerged into the courtroom, where At

would be no prosecution, because there
was no evidence against the students.

Two score young women students at
the Oakland High School, more or less
closely identified with a Bchool society
known as "The Lambs," have been in
vestigated by J. W. McClymonds, City
Superintendent of Schools. "This
Lambs" were too frisky, according to
a complaint that found its way to-day
to the offices" of the Board of Educa
tion. The girls indulged in overmuch
demonstration during the noon hour
when sister pupils not initiated into
the mysteries of '"The Lambs" ap
peared in sight.
"The Lambs," it was said, had been
given to tantalizing those who were
riot of their association.
It was declared that "The Lambs"
would blockade the Jefferson-street en
trance to the high school and would
compel their unlucky schoolmates to
run a gauntlet of very lively badinage.
All of this was related with so much
force that the superintendent was com
pelled to go to the school.
"It's only a tempest in a teapot,"
said Superintendent McClymonds. "So
far as Principal Pond and myself
could discover, no great harm has been
done. I know boys will be boys at
school and their sisters, I imagine, en-
Joy a bit of fun- as well. We might
have to curb the frolicsome 'Lambs' a
bit, but it is only an incident of school
discipline."

had a fortune of $250,000 given her
at her mother's death, which she
spent at the rate of $3000 a month.
Her estate now is very small and if
she were given <t she would return to

The recent parsing of thousands of wagon
loads of ;nicrobe-lr.fested earth and dirt along
Harrison street has left in its wake an epi
demic of malaria. Numbers along that aristo
cratic thoroughfare have recently been afflicted
with malarial troubles and they one and all
avcribe this sudden ailing in a hitherto healthy
neighborhood to the unclean debris which was
carted from the lot where the new Polytechnic
building is bflng erected, the wagons paÂ«sing
in dally procession along Harrison street. At
any rate it is only since the dirt-hauling
b<gan that residents along the line of parade
have fallen ill and when all are afflicted In
the same way it is natural to ascribe it to a
common cause.
Stephen Gage was among the first to fall ill
and he is Just beginning to enjoy his usual
good health again. Then young De Golia.

The conference is likely to be an in
teresting one, as the ground for the
objection of the Alameda County Asso
ciation to the completion of the work
is the subject of much speculation. It
is understood that this objection is
based purely upon economical lines.
There is going to be a general dis
cussion of the proposed scenic boule
vard between Oakland and Haywards,
the date to be agreed upon between
the various commercial and improve
ment bodies in the district through
which the boulevard will pass and the
Board of Supervisors. This is. the out
come of the protest that was presented
to the Supervisors yesterday " against
any further action upon the boulevard.
The protest came from the Alameda
County Association^ an organization
which has been looking very' closely
into the tax affairs of the county, and
the Supervisors at once postponed ac
tion until the members of the associa
tion could be heard.
This is one of the largest pieces of
work that the county of Alameda now
has on hand, and when the Supervisors
suspended action a number of other
public bodies took the matter up. The
Oakland Board of Trade and the Mer
chants' Exchange decided to-day that
they wanted to be heard in the mat
ter, and they will send committees to
the coming conference. ,
Haywards, which will be thesouth
ern terminus of the boulevard, took ac
tion to-night, when a mass meeting
was held, which was presided over by
George Oakes and which was called
by the Board of Trade of Haywards.
President Oakes was authorized to ap
point a committee to attend this con
ference, and the committee was in
structed to urge upon the Supervisors
the importance of constructing the
boulevard. Havwards Is much inter
ested in this work and is strongly in
favor of its completion.

The case against Sargent was not
strong. "The material had been stolen,
it was found in a shed in the rear of
the Sargent residence and Sargent was
said to have told- .a. deputy town mar
shal of ; Berkeley that "he didn't know
why he did it." But the shed was used
jointly by a number of people and Sar
gent went pn the stand and swore that
he made no such statement as the one
that seemed to implicate him.
A. L. Frick, who" defended Sargent,
rested his case with Sargent as the only
witness" and "the Jury decided' that the
theft had not been sufficiently fixed
upon the student and acquitted him.
It had been Intended by' the defense to
claim that the young man's mind was
a blank if he took the stuff, but this
was found not to be necessary.
Earl Sargent, the university student
who was arrested for stealing material
from the partly completed residence of
Professor John Galen Howard of the
State University, was to-day acquitted
without having to resort to his plea of
insanity that his attorney expected to
make.'
The rear of the Sargent residence at
Berkeley was found, to be filled with
material that had been taken from this
and other residences and two charges
were lodged against the young mar.
One was .dismissed some time ago as
being . technically defective, but the
second case went to trial to-day before
Justice Qulnn. There was an array of
university professors and officers from
the college town, including John Galen
Howard, Professor W. E. Ritter and
William F. Wilson Jr., the plumber
who owned the material that was
taken.

tence. Curtis says that he fails to find
any authority or law for this custom.
Curtis says he does not want to as

Yesterday morning's session of the
commission of engineers that is con
sidering the problem of flood control
was spent in listening to the opinions
of Titus Hale and J. Warren Dutton,
who discussed the dredging of the
Sacramento River and the protection
of lowlands from flood waters.
Mr. Dutton said the obstruction of
channels was almost entirely caused
by the debris from the mines. The
building of levees resembling those on
the Mississippi would tend to confine
the river waters to their proper chan
nels. At present some of the small
levees are weak, and on- the Feather
River, for instance, when the water
begins to rise, hundreds are called out
to watch the weak places night and
day. The amount of rise in many of
the rivers is almost unbelievable. Sev
eral times It has been . necessary to
raise the towns along the river batiks.
Former State Engineei H. Hall
presented a voluminous Report on the
conditions during his administration.
He asked for a further hearing at a
later session.' 1 . I---;-

Daly Will Change Bill.
The management ot- the Columbia
Theater has made the interesting an
nouncement to the effect that Arnold
Daly has decided, in deference to the
many requests sent him, to appear in
Bernard Shaw's one-act play, "The
Man of Destiny." The play will be
given in conjunction with "Candida,"
commencing with to-morrow night,
and the double bill will be offered for
four nights and Saturday matinee. It
will show Daly and his players in a
widely different line of work.
"The Man of Destiny" deals with
Napoleon's early life and is termed a
satirical comedy. The two plays
make quite a long bill and the cur-
tain will necessarily be raised at 8
o'clock sharp on "Candida" so that
"The Man of Destiny" will be over at
a seasonable hour. There will be
short waits between the acts of "Can
dida" and between that play and "The
man of Destiny" time will be taken
only for the setting of the scene as
quickly as possible.
"The Man of Destiny" was played
in New York by Daly and his com
pany and was received with every
mark of approbation. It is said that
the Napoleonic satire is one of the
best recent one-act dramas and will
serve to show Daly in a forcible and
entertaining performance.
Performances will be given every
evening, with prices of 25, 35 and 50
cents, and a few front rows in the or
chestra, and a few front rows on the or-
Saturdays and legal holidays prices
will be 25 and 50 cents. A new feature
made by the management will be the
"bargain matinee" every Thursday
afternoon, at which the uniform price
of 25 cents will be charged for reserved
seats in every part of the house. The
box office will open Thursday, Septem

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Aug. 30.
Despite the efforts of the faculty to
prevent any rush between the sopho
mores and the freshmen, the trouble
that has been brewing during the past
two or three days came to-night. Al
most as soon as the electric lights went
out in Encina Hall, in the big general
dormitory, the rush began. Freshmen
to the number of about 100 gathered in
the vestibule of the hall and the sopho
mores, fewer in number, ->on the broad
stone walk outside. Upon the steps,
commanding a good view of the pros
pective battlefield, stood a large num
ber of the men of the upper classes.
Suddenly, with a yell, the sophomores
came through the big entrance door
like a shot and in a moment the big
fight was on. The aim of each side
was to carry away its opponents to the
bath tubs at either end of the hall and
there was hardly a moment that these
did not have from one to two occu
pants. Special efforts were made to
duck the most prominent members of
each class and several of these went in
three or four times. Owing to their
superior numbers the freshmen had
considerably the best of the argument.
The rush came to an end after an hour,
when the men were all completely woft
out. No one was seriously hurt.
An effort was made by several upper
classmen to prevent the rush, but
without success. The trustees of the
university and the faculty are strongly
opposed to rushing." Although the rush
was in progress for mare than an hour,
fio one in authority appeared to sup
press it.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Hon. Leslie M. Shaw, Secretary of
the Treasury, will arrive in San Fran
cisco next Saturday, and in the evening
of that day will speak in the Alhambra
Theater. The meeting will be held un
der the auspices of the Republican
State Central Committee, General
George Stone chairman. It is expected
that a large audience will assemble at
the Alhambra to hear the eminent
speaker. The meeting will signalize the
opening of the Presidential campaign in
California. Secretary Shaw speaks at
Portland, Or., this evening. He will
leave San Francisco Tuesday evening,
September 6, and on Wednesday even
ing, September 7, will speak in Los An
geles.
Activity prevails at the headquarters
of the Republican State Committee in
the Palace Hotel. The party nominees
for Congress are preparing for a thor
ough and vigorous canvass of their re
spective' districts.
J. N. Gillette, who so ably represents
the First District in the House of Rep
resentatives, is on his way to Modoc
County. He will speak at Alturas, Su
sanville and other points in that region
of the great district early in the cam
paign.
Duncan K. McKinlay of Santa Rosa,
the able and eloquent nominee of the
Republican party in the Second Dis
trict, will speak to the people of Sono
ma County this week. McKinlay was
nominated for Congress by the people
of the Second District. The large and
enthusiastic convention at the Casino
in Santa Cruz registered the will ot the
people. The Democratic Congressional
Convention at Santa Cruz was a small
cut-and-dried affair. Tho gathering in
the ladies' parlor of the St. George
Hotel consisted of twenty-two dele
gates by actual count and a few petri
fied politicians, who were ready to
adopt the resolutions of 1798.
Dnncan McKinlay in Congress will be
able to accomolish something for the
farmers who dwell in the great valley
of the Sacramento. His abilities will
command a hearing and his position as
a Republican will give him recognition
in committee work. Reports come from
every county in the Second that the
district will be redeemed in November
by the triumphant election of the Re
publican nominee.
J. C. Needham. who was first elected
to Congress in 189S and who has served
with distinguished ability in every ses
sion since that time, will begin his
campaign for re-election on September
15. A little bunch of Democrats, thir
teen in number, met at Santa Cruz last
week and nominated William M. Con
ley of Madera to run in opposition to
Needham. Conley, of course, will
traverse the Sixth District and talk
pleasantly to the voters, but in the end
he will share the fate of Castle, Crich
ton and Ashe, who went down to de
feat in a struggle to wrest Congres
sional honors from the Republican
standard-bearer, J. C. Needham. The
impression that Judge Conley is a vote
getter is misleading. Official records
show that he fails to get the average
vote of his party.
The Republican State Committee will
soon be advised of S. C. Smith's tour
of the Eighth District and of the cam
paign of E. A. Hayes in the Fifth.
MISSOULJ, Mont.. Aug. 30.â United
States Senator W. A. Clark was at
tacked here to-day by an insane man
known as "Joe" Peg, who thought the
Senator had been breaking the game
laws and was carrying a grouse in his
pocket, and who had threatened to take
the Senator's life. Peg followed the
Senator several blocks, persistently
calling upon him to hand over the
grouse.
Senator Clark ran panting into the
lobby of the Florence Hotel and de
manded protection. He was sure that
Peg had a revolver, for several times
the latter had made motions as though
to draw one and threatened to shoot
unless the Senator gave up the grouse.
Several persons sprang to his assist
ance and the man was overpowered.
He imagined he was the State Game
Warden.

When the writer was about to
marry, the wife of a well-known Judge
gave her this advice:
"My dear, a woman needs the wis
dom of Solomon, the patience of Job
and the meekness of a dove to get
along with the best man that ever
lived. I have my third husband, all
good men, but all cranky at times.
When they are cranky, keep still:
when they fret, hold their tongue, and
always remember that it takes two to
make a quarrel."
In writing the dear old lady after
some years of experience at the head
quarters of an army, where I was sur
rounded by some 30,000 men, I took
occasion to say: >^ 7
"The more I see of men the bet
ter I like them, and as to quarreling,
you are quite right. I should like to
add that your admirable advice might
perhaps be supplemented by adding:
'Exercise tact, and spell It large.' Tact

open hostility and aggressiveness

weather, and these obtuse creatures
never can understand that harmless
insincerities are demanded everywhere
save in a savage state. Absolute sin
cerity is only possible to a hermit in a
wilderness. Hence it is that when one
meets an entirely honest man or
woman, who tells the unvarnished truth
â as he- or she conceives it â on every
occasion, one turns about and goes the
other way. Charm and absolute frank
ness are strangers to each other. One
person who speaks the truth in a com
munity of others who do not is like a
bull in a china shop; if all said exactly
what they meant, then it would be pos
sible.
cerity on the part of a woman, but this
writer does not think so. Indeed, a
great desire to please usually springs
from a warm heart and is a much more
charming characteristic than an indif
ference to the opinion of others and
not" caring whether one is liked or not.
Many will disagre with - the writer in
thinking that a power of subtle flattery
is desirable, but few persons who have
come much in contact with others or
who know life will disagree., The
woman who. is charming knows how to
flatter with sincerity, if such an ex
pression may be allowed. It is always
pleasant to meet this sort of a charm
ing woman because she makes us feel
kindly toward ourselves. She- brings
out our good points and makes us ap
pear well. That is a secret of many
a woman's charm; she knows how: to
aiake her friends appear at their best.
The above is a letter which appeared
in a New York paper in response, to
some request for different ideas of a
charming woman, and there are points
in it worthy of comment, says a con
tributor to the St. Paul Globe. One
thing is quite evident, and that is it
was written by a thoughtful person
who has not formed his opinion impul
sively and knows whereof he speaks.

Beauty is not essential, but grace of
bearing and daintiness in surroundings,
with an air of the world going well
with one, are. They give a sense of
case and restfulness.
The charming woman never has
grievances; never lives in a vale of
tears or sits in Judgment. She is the
pleader, the consoler.

writers call "a pretty wit."

Then began the acute antagonism of Hill against Cleveland. After

in taking the party away from the President's leadership. Alter his Sena

entire control of New York and enabled that gigantic steal of $30,000,000,
the di>covery and punishment of which by Tilden secured his leadership of
the Democratic party and his nomination for the Presidenc\\
Hill was retired from politics when Tweed went to jail and his fellow
citizen of Elmira, Lucius Robinson, was made Governor by Tilden. Robinson
was no sham reformer and' used his power as Governor to oust from office a
lot of predatory Tammany officers in New York City. By that time John
Kelly had inherited Tweed's war paint, feathers and scalping knife as chief
of Tamnwny and when Robinson ran for re-election Kelly ran against him
und defeated him, electing Cornell. This revival of Tammany in the over
throw of Robinson brought Hill out of retirement, and he emerged as Major
of Elmira and then was put on the ticket with Cleveland for Lieutenant Gov
ernor, bringing Tammany back from its wanderings. He became Governor
when Cleveland was elected to the Presidency. In 1888 he was. the nominee
to succeed himself, and with Tammany again conspired the treachery which
defeated Cleveland 'in the State, but secured h% own election, defeating

HILL RETIRES.
growth. H. J. OSTRANDER.
Merced, Aug. 27.
Editor The Callâ In your issue of the
26th you mention the arrival of William
C. Hodge, an expert of the Unitel
States Bureau of Forestry, who Is in
charge of the co-operative forestry in
vestigations being carried on by th*
State and Federal governments.
Being a lover and worshiper of for
ests, I am always glad to. know that
any effort is being made that will tend
to protect our wonderful forests.
Mr. Hodge says that E. A. Sterling
will make a study of the forest fires,
their causes and effects, and recom
mendations for their control.
With the prevention' of â¢; forest flrea
the whole problem of forestry is solved,
together with winter floods, summer
droughts and reforesting the already
denuded districts over which devas
tating fires have passed. An effectual
system of preserving the forests should
be established and indorsed in all na
tional parks and forest reserves.
Having been familiar with the forests
of the Sierras for fifty-five years, I know
of no way of preventing fires but by
preventing the accumulation of great
quantities of fuel for fire, such as dead
trees (fallen and standing), dead brush,
pine needles, pine burrs and dry grass
and weeds. These should be burned
each year under the supervision of
competent foresters. This practice has
been successfully followed In the Mari
posa Big Tree grove of sequoias, near
Wawona, which was some ten years
ago threatened with being extinguished
from the great accumulation of debris
then upon the ground.
It seems that a part of the duties of
this commission is to map out the for
ests with a view of their withdrawal
for forest reserves. Would it not seem
a wise policy to protect the reserves
already withdrawn?
With all the science and knowledse
of the present time I can see no prac
tical and sure method of preventing
forest fires but by returning to the
practice of the Indians in burning the
accumulation of debris each year.
These Indians burned over the ground
so that they could more easily hunt
their game.
When I first traveled in the moun
tains they were a beautiful park, with
very little undergrowth and brush, and
by returning to the habit of the Indians
Ihe mountains will again be a lovely
park, in place of thickets of under-
How To Protect
Beautiful Forests
of Golden State
Of this the settlement and proper adjustment of the hack drivers' strike
is a satisfactory evidence. An organized community has imposed itself be
tween the parties to a strike and has declared itself on the side of the law.
As a rfMilt a new baÂ«e line is established on which all future settlements ot
:-uch dispute* will be made, and the organized community will neither permit
nor tolerate any other. The gain lor law and order is immeasurable. The
reputation ot San Francisco is higher advanced than ever, and it is easily
seen that from this city the correct principle will issue .for the guidance and
jiood of other communities in which the same situations may develop.
After all the qreate-t gainers from the settlement should be the labor
unions them^eh e-. AH reasonable members of those powerful Organizations
know that it is viciously wrong to deny to other? the rights which they claim
for thcmstlves. The law confers equality of right on all citizens. Therefore
those who bv force. destroy that equality place themselves in criminal opposi
tion to the law. The Hack Drivers' Union has^reccded from that form of
violation of the law and by doing so it has set a good American* example for
other union* to follow. The Call heartily eongratulatesQiH parties that tiffs
dispute has been amicably settled and that g&at.and enduring principle?
underlie lhat Settlement:
Organization means power, and power strong enough to def^i the law has
a uniform tendency. toward intolerance. When such power is strong enough
to paralyze ihe arm of the peace establishment, strong enough to enjoy the
tigni of policemen looking on indifferently at personal assaults and breaches
of ihe peace of ta\j>ayer> r.nd injuries to their property, while in other fields
men clothed with the same public authority murder or maim citizens in a
petty dicpste over the enforcement of a tax on dogs, the community may
wÂ«?ll take alarm. That alarm has been felt and has resulted in opposing
organization with organization, with the result that here at least the day
has gone by in which employers and property owners could Â©te compelled to
surrender to -un'.awn:! physical force.
THE hack drivers' strike, which began in May last, has been settled
on what seem to be sane and reasonable lines. Several times during
the pendency of the struggle there appeared, in it the evil features that
attended a similar strike in Chicago, such as interference with funerals and
assaults on drivers who took the place of the strikers.
There is no doubt that here and elsewhere the interests of law and order
end the permanent welfare of union labor have been greatly injured by the
use of physical force by mistaken men as means of winning a strike. This
evil feature appears in the butchers' strike in Chicago. When President Don
nelly appealed to the law against the meat packers in the matter of lodging
their employes in the plants he said that would get the new employes out of
the plants and the strikers would see that they never got back. Yet the
law to which he had appealed successfully, if enforced, made the streets of
Chicago free and safe for the use of the new employes on their way to
and from their work. His boast. that he had sufficient physical force at his
command to destroy this freedom and safety was a dedar.C$ion that he was
above the law and could safely defy it.
When such boasts are made and arc carried out by denying free use
of the streets and highways and by putting the property of others in a state
of siese, under conditions that can legitimately prevail only in a state of
public war between national belligerents, a situation is created that is in
tolerab'e in a country like this. Yet that situation has freque&ly occurred,
until there has grown up a powerful public sentiment ag^in^t yielding to any
demands that arc backed up by unlawful force/
The employers and owners of property must obey the law because
their property is a tangible hostage given to the law to secure such obedience.
Hut ihe law owes them value received. For their obedience they arc cn
lit'ed to protection in the uÂ»e of their property. Whenever and wherever they
surrender to physical force, that surrender is Â©arlet testimony to treason
of the officer? of the law, who have failed in its enforcement. The result may
he Seen in Colorado, where those who sowed oÂ°c the wind have been reaping
of ihe whirlwind.

THe trial of Alexander B. Garnett,
charged with the murder of Major J.
Vv\ McClung on November 25, is draw
ing to a close before a jury in Judge
Lawlor's court. The evidence for the
defense was given yesterday and As
sistant District Attorney Ferral con
cluded his itrgument to the jury- He
will be followed this morning by At
torney George D. Collins for the de
fense and District Attorney Byington
will then close for the State.
Dr. George H. Martin waa called for
the defense to testify to a re
mark Mrs. Elizabeth W. Colt was al
leged to have made in his hearing that
the shooting was accidental. This tes
timony, however, was excluded. At
torney H. T. Creswell. William A. St.
Amant and Captain Stafford H. Par
ker gave testimony as to defendant's
character. , ' .
The defendant testified In his own
behalf. He asserted that the shoot
ing was, accidental. He said that Ma
jor McClang advanced upon him and
hf- (Garnett) drew the revopor. The
major seized his arm and while forc
ing it downward the. weapon exploded.
Ho had no quarrel ; with Mrs. Coit, but
she had "got mad"-at him while they
were playing at bridge whist on No
vember 12 because he had told her
she had made a wrong lead.
Attorney Collins wanted to introduce
a transcript of the statement made
by Mrs. Coit to Coroner Leland in her
rooms in the Palace Hotel on the day
prior to the inquest, but it was ob
jected to by the District Attorney and
the objection was sustained.
The jury to try the<:ase of George T.
Querbach, charged with the murder of
Mrs. Annie Wilson at, her residence, 5

Ross. Daniel S. Davis, J. W. Tamm,
Patrick Riley, W. B. Wetmdre, George
E. Kidder, G. Zintner, Joseph A. Stultz
and J. J. Kreisa.
A number of witnesses were ex
amined, but nothing new whs elicited
from them. The most important point
was the introduction of a letter writ
teu the day . after the murder by
j "Charles George Smith" to Captain
; Martin. The handwriting was identi
; fled by Expert Theodore Kytka as that
> of the defendant. He wrote confessing
that he had killed Mrs. Wilson and
that the police would search for him
| in vain, as he would be dead. He had
a bottle of carbolic acid in his pocket,
which he would swallow as soon as he
; had finished writing the letter. He
had killed Mrs. Wilson in a frenzy and
passion. She was the only woman he
had ever loved and friends had set her
mind against him. When he had gone
;to her for his clothes on the day be
fore her death she had threatened to
put a bullet through his brain.

The dairy inspectors are engaged in
serving copies of the new ordinance
prescribing regulations for the sani
tary conduct of dairies, which will go
into effect on September 15 next". Al
ready the milk' dealers have expended
thousands of dollars in improving the
conditions of their dairies. Unless they
comply I with the rules the Board of
Health will revoke their permits to sell
milk.
In connection with Ragan's investi
gations the Board of Health is pre
paring to recommend to the Board of
Supervisors the passage of an ordi
nance requiring the presence of 30 per
cent of butter fat in cream. Hereto
fore there has been no standard in that
regard. The standard of butter fat
in milk was recently raised to 3.4 per
cent. â¢ â¢ Â¦ '
Dr. Ragan further learned that it
was the common practice of some deal
ers to mix the cream which was re
ceived in its pure state from dairies
with skimmed milk and also the thick
ening with the result that one gallon
of cream would be transformed into
two Kallons of the mixture, which was
then sold as pure cream. Deputy
Health Officer Levy reports that thirty
three samples of cream out of forty
eight examined were found to be adul
terated.
Following close upon its crusade for
pure milk the Health Board, upon the
recommendation of Health Officer Ra- :
Ban; will, within a week, order the
arrest of some thirty owners of dairy
depots on the charge of adul
terating cream. Deputy Health Officer
Levy stated yesterday that prosecu
tions will be conducted under the State
law which forbids the adulteration of
any kind of food U8ed for human con
sumption. >
Dr. Hasan has been making a quiet
investigation for the past three weeks
and ascertained that the cream sup
plied by dairy depots was being mixed
with thickening for the purpose of,
doubling its quantity. Ragan secured
samples of cream and also of the thick
ening, which is sold to milk dealers,
and the samples were submitted to
Medical Chemist Bothe for analysis.
One of the samples was found to
contain vegetable coloring matter, to
gether with borax and gelatine. A sam
ple of thickening known commercially
as "viscogin" was analyzed and, found
to be nothing but cane sugar. The
sample resisted the test for grape and
milk sugar.

In Judge Seaweli's court yesterday a
hearing was started in the retrial of the
contest begun in Sonoma County
against the will of Lydia C. Wicker
sham. The contestant is Cora L.. TV'ick
ersharn, widow of Frank Wickersham,
who before his death was a political
boss at Fresno and at one time chair
man of the Board of Supervisors there.
Lydia Wickersham was the widow of
I. G. Wickersham, the Petaluma bank
er, who left an estate appraised at
$650,000. Her own estate approximated
$500,000. There were four children-
Fred W. and Frank Wickersham, Mrs.
Lizzie Maclay and Mrs. May Berge
vin.
Frank Wickersham received nothing
by his father's will. It is claimed that
it was represented to him before hia
mother's death that she had made a
will cutting him off. On this repre
sentation, the contestant charges, he
sold his expectancy in his mother's es
tate to his brother and sisters for $28,
000. The mother died in February,
1900, and when her will was produced
it was found that it gave Frank only
$50. Within a year afterward Frank
Wickersham died and his widow con
tended that his mother had left him so
little because the old lady had been led
to believe that he had received in ad
vance his prospective share in her es
tate from his brother and sisters.
The suit was tried first at Santa Rosa
and decided against the contestant. A
motion for a new trial was made and
granted and from the later order an
appeal was taken to the Supreme
Court. The lower court was sustained
and the new trial has now come on be
fore Judge Seawell.
Some of the depositions in the case,
tending to prove that Frank Wicker
shum was of unsound mind when he
sold his interest in his prospective es
tate, were read yesterday by Attorney
Francis K. Heney. The other side was
represented in court by J. C. Campbell
of this city and Thomas J. Geary of

NEW YORK, Aug. 30. â In view of
the fatal accident during the auto
mobile races at St. Louis because of
dust clouds obscuring the view of the
competing drivers, plans are being
made to obviate the same danger in

be done by sprinkling the course with
oil at the approaches to railroad cross-
Ings and turns. The course is thirty
miles ln length, and, owing to the cost,
only the danger points will^be oiled.
The same plan has been followed suc
cessfully in France during recent

Dies From a Fractured Skull.
Jack Munroe will leave for the East
to-day, seeking new fields to conquer.
He knows there is nothing for him here
but a job on a scow schooner or some
thing of the sort. Jack does not know
yet what he will do In the future, but
expects to make some kind of a pick
up away from the Golden Gate. He
still bears some of the marks of his re
cent beating, but otherwise looks in
good form.
There seems nothing ln sight for Jef
fries but absolute retirement from, the
ring. The big champ seems to have
gone as far as he can, and unless he
contracts to beat an army of men in
one night he will probably be forced
to say good-by to the prlzering for a
while and perhaps forever. As wide
awake and diplomatic as the fistic pro
moters are none of them is equal to the
situation of digging up a man to pit
against the champion of all cham
pions. â¢Â»"
A story was sent over the wires from
the East last night to the effect that
Jeff had signed to box. Jack O'Brien.
The knowing ones here would not stand
for anything of the kind and the rumor
was passed up as the most idle kind
of weak fight talk.

The Secretary' of the Treasury has
denied the petition of J. M. Rigrgs for
a remission of the fine of $200 paid
by the Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company for bringing Mrs.. RlgrgT3
from Honolulu to San Francisco on
June 1. Mrs. Rigga is one of the
Afong Rirls. When the Coptic arrived
at Honolulu Mrs. Riggs paid the
master of the vessel $200 to pay the
fine, in addition to her passage money,
because she was in a hurry to join her
mother, who was then sick in Phila
delphia. The Coptic, being a foreign
vessel, ls not allowed to trade between
one port and another of the United
States. The Secretary of the Treasury
could not see any valid reason why tha
fine should be returned.

brought forth another. Spencer hit;
stole to second; advanced on an out
and arrived on Steelman's flukey one to
third. Ham Iberg swelled the score in
the final spasm by bringing in Beck
from second with a scorcher to center.
For five innings Oakland never got
a man to first base. Then, with one
in the cellar, during rqund six, Jimmy
Byrnes tore off a scratchy one to third
base. Buck Francks followed with
one to left, but they both died there.

The cellar brigade, otherwise the
Oakland ball team, kept swinging their
heads off yesterday at Idora Park at
Mr. Ham Iberg's collection of slow
ones, fast ones and easy ones. They all
looked 'alike and the Commuters were
lucky to chase one man home in the
final round. This would not have been
either had Mr. Spencer refrained from
dozing at his post of duty. Score:
Portland 3, Oakland 1.
The game was a battle of the tail
enders and therefore no und'ie enthu
siasm was exploded. Althougn slow in
the matter of hours and minutes, it
was a fair enough exhibition of the
pitchers' art, with the honors on
Iberg's side all the time. Even errors
did not unnerve Ham, for he mixed
'em up and pitched the same kind of
ball all the time.
Fred Lord of New York City was the
first runner to cross the goal line, but
he was immediately disqualified on the
charge that he had ridden about three
miles in an automobile in traversing
the course over the country roads.
Lord readily admitted that he had done
to because of physical exhaustion for a
time. Forty runners had been en
tered In the race, but only thirty-one
Ftarted. Of these sixteen were Ameri
cans, ten Greeks, two Kaffirs, one
<'uban, one Frenchman and one man
fixin South Africa.
The 6tarter's pistol cracked at 3:03
o'clock ar.d Hicks sprang into the lead
with the field following at his heels.
The racers ran five laps on the Stad
ium track and then, passing through a
pate, struck out on the country road
course, which was designated by red
flags placed along the way.
In entering the course Hicks had
fallen back with six men ahead. The
course led ow*er hills and through dales
innumerable, being pronounced one of
the most uphill and downhill courses
ever traveled by athletes in any event
and the roads were deep in dust. Spec
tators were gathered In throngs at dif
ferent points along the way and lustily
cheered the men as they passed. A
vanguard of horsemen cleared the
thoroughfares and judges, physicians
and newspaper men followed in auto
mobiles.
IOCKS' GREAT PERFORMANCE.
When the halfway point was reached
Lord, who had become exhausted,
passed in an automobile. Mellor was
the first man to pass the halfway
point, followed by Newton a short dis
tance behind. Closely following New
ton, came Hicks, running easily.
When the twenty-mile point had been
reached Lord again started running.
Hicks was running "with mechanical
exactness, slowly and with every mo
tion of his body Indicating by Its regu
larity and apparent effort that he was
Buffering from fatigue. But he was still
full of grit. In answer to a question
as to how he was feeling he called
back over his shoulder: "I want some
thing to eat as soon as I get there. I
am nearly starved."
He maintained his pace until within
two miles fit the goal, when he drop
ped to a walk in climbing a hill, the
first time he had ceased running. At
the top of the hill a crowd cheered him
vigorously, which renewed his flagging
energy and he broke into a run, main
taining it until he reached the entrance
to the Stadium track. Then, amid tre
mendous cheering of spectators he re
doubled his pace, rushed half way
around the track and in the gathering
darkness crossed the tape a winner.
The crowd had scarcely quieted from
Its ovation when Corey, who had made
tremendous headway in the last
stretch, ran into the Stadium and
crossed the line second. Again the
cheering ensued and when it had died
itway Newton ran into the Stadium
find scored as third man.
Long after night had fallen other
runners straggled in.
William R. Garcia of San Francisco,
nne of the runners, was found lying
unconscious to-ni e ht by the roadside,
several miles from the Stadium. He
was conveyed to the Emergency Hos
pital at the World's Fair, where he was
restored to consciousness. The physi
cians state that he will probably be
fully recovered after a good rest.
ST. LOUIS, Aug. 30.â The Olympic
Marathon race, the third foot race con
test of the kind ever held and the first
ever held on American soil, partici
pated in by thirty-one men, classed
among the fleetest "runners of the
world, was won to-day by Thomas J.
Hicks cf Cambridge. Mass.. who is thÂ«
i';rst American to win this event, cele
brated In the revival of Olympic games.
Albert J. Corey of Chicago, a native
born Frenchman, crossed the goal line
tecocd. A. L. Newton of New York
City finished third. The distance of the
race was forty kilometers, equal to
twenty-four miles and fifteen hundred
yards. This distance was run by
Hicks ln the officially announced time
of 3 hours. 2S minutes and 53 seconds;
Corey, 3 hours, 34 minutes and 15 sec
onds; Newton, 3 hours, 47 minutes and
S3 eeconds.
The first Olympic Marathon race was
held at Athene, Greece, in 1S96, and
Â¦was won by Lieues, a Greek, 2 hours
and P5 minutes; the second Olympic
Marathon race was held In Paris in
1S00 and won by Teato of France in
T hours and 59 minutes. The winner
of to-day's race received a cup pre
sented by President Francis of the ex-
I'crsltion and an Olympic championship
Fold medal; second, a silver medal, and
third, a medal of bronze.
KUXXER IS DISQUALIFIED.
Many pin their faith to James
Sweeney's fast puppies. Rocked Asleep
and Rusty Anchor. The Sacramento
contingent will be strongly represented
by Georse Xethercott's La Ro3a and
Clydette and by W. T. Rausht's Fear
less Lad. Dr. F. P. Clark of Stockton
will start Son of Erin and Free Erin.
Eugene Geary has Ina Cissus and An
gus Cissus ready f6r the struggle. John
Sutton will start Secretive and Sampler,
which have done well ln trials.
A party of fifteen coursing men of
Los Angeles will come north to see the
stake run and large delegations are
expected from the Interior.
The draw will be held to-night at
Pythian Castle after a meeting of the
Interstate Coursing Club, when the
prize money wi'l be apportioned and
the officials chosen. Each stake will
be run down once on Saturday. There
will be two trains on that day, one at
10:15 o'clock and the other at 1:30.
There will be four trains on Sunday.
Coursing men are looking forward
with the deepest interest to the fifth
revival of the California Futurity, for
greyhounds whelped ln 190C. which will
be run at Union Coursing Park on Sat
urday and Sunday. One hundred and
forty-four greyhounds in all will start
at the meeting, there being an open
and a reserve stake to fill out the card.
There will be no coursing at Insrleslcls
Park this week.
It is conceded vhat the Futurity of
this year outclasses in quality any of
those already run. Usually one ruppy
stands out above the t/thers in Â«pee<i
but this year there are a number vt
promising ones, thus giving thi stake
an open look. Contrary to the usual
conditions nearly every dog in th-Â»
stake has been tried publicly so that
the form of them all is known.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 30.â There was j
not much of interest to-day in the rac- !
ing card. The absence of close finishes
made the results uninteresting -save i
from the bettors' standpoint. In the ,
harness division Erosmont, well '
handled by Ben Chaboya, won a special
trot, which was made to do duty for
the two harness races which ordinarily
head the card.
Tuck Back won the five furlong
dash from a field of thirteen. He was
well played at 5 to 2. Maggie Mitchell,
at 20 to 1, secured the place, the show
going to Hurrah at 30 to 1.
Sir Preston, the favorite, captured
the money ln the six l^rlong race, win
ning by a length from Aunt Polly, with
Nullah third.
The mile dash went to Pilot at 2 to
1. He won by a length and a half.
Tannhauser, at 3 to 2, was second and
Dr. Birdsall third.
Brennus, at even money, was banked
upon by the talent to win the last race
at five and a half furlongs. He did not
show inside the money. Sol Lichta
stein won by a length from Potencia,
which beat Victoria a half length for

SHEEPSHEAD BAT, N. Y., Aug. 30.
It was with regret the race-going pub
lic saw Delhi beaten so easily in the
mile handicap to-day, vvhich was never
really a contest after the first five fur
longs. The winner, First Mason, is a
slashing four-year-old, a half-brother
to McChesney, and was developed by
the racing firm of Oots Bros, of Lex
ington, who developed both llermis and
McChesney. Few thought First Mason
was good enough to beat Delhi, not
withstanding that Mr. Keene's three
year-old was conceding the Western
horse twenty-two pounds. That some
one backed First Mason is a fact, how
ever, as his odds were cut ln the clos
ing betting from 8 to 1 down to ( to L
Hardly had the barrier been released
and the field was well under way be
fore it became apparent Delhi could not
run away from First Mason, as he had
been doing with other horses. This in
itself was an ominous sign, and as the
two horses raced almost on equal
terms, with Lyne sitting still on First
Mason and Odom uneasy, and, in fact,
"niggling" at Delhi, all hopes vanished
that the Keene colt would win. As the
horses finished the first, six furlongs it
was conceded that Delhi was beaten,
and First Mason came home with Lyne
still taking it easy, the horse winning
by three lengths. Under a drive of
more than a quarter of a mile Delhi
saved second money from Marmee, an
outsider, which but for getting off a
bad last might have finished second.
Beldame won the Dolphin stakes, at
one mile and a furlong. Ormonde's
Right was second and Aurumaster
third. Summary:

CHICAGO, Aug. 30.â Bragg upset one
of the biggest attempted killings of the
racing season to-day when he beat Fos
sil a neck in the third race, a handicap
at a mile and an eighth, at Harlem.
Fossil, which ran some sensational
races in California, but which has not
shown *his true form until to-day, was
backed from 15 to 1 down to 5% at post
time, and was still being played when
the field went to the post. Dr. Stephens
and Bombardier went to the front at
the start, but down the back stretch
Mountain rushed Fossil to the front
and thereby made his run too soon.
Rounding the half-mile pole Bragg set
sail for the good thing, and when
straightened out for home Fossil led by
only a length, with Bragg gaining at
every stride. It was a long, hard drive,
but Bragg displayed the greater game
ness and won the verdict by a narrow
margin.
The track was fast, the weather per
fect and the attendance good. Sum

KKING. Aug. 30.â Professor Jere
r.iah Jenks, Commissioner to China
frosj the United States, has just com
e;cd the first step toward the estab
:fhm<Â»nt cf a gold standard. After
sue months of -hard work he has re
crnetj to America.
!>.? object of Professor Jenks' mis
sion was to advise with the Chinese
I vrrnrn^r.t on the advantages of a
nfform monetary system with a gold
and to make and receive sugges
rs as to the best methods to employ
changing from silver to gold, with
- J^ast economic disturbance.
J'rofesscr Jenks interviewed the high
ondals at Peking and the
t important viceroys and governors
throughout China. The interest in the
abject has b^en remarkable and ex
â¢ ds anything shown before along
three !:rÂ»s of legitimate r^Torm. Pop
th:s work may result in the
--â¢ .ir-3 charge.
enks ? Visit May Result in
the Country's Conversion
to Uniform Monetary Plan
The launches were then tied together
and with a line to- the foremost the
General Sternberg took them all to the
quarantine station. All hands were
ordered ashore. The Sternberg re
turned to the Skagit and in about an
hour the violators of the quarantine
regulations were allowed to return to
their boats and make the best of their
way home against a strong tide.
There was a stampede over the side
and silence reigned on the Skagit's
deck. Thomas Crowley, the launch
king, was discovered by one of the
surgeons in the barkentine forecastle,
explaining to a Chinese that it would
be cheaper for the Oriental passengers
to ride ashore in a Crowley launch at
'steen bits a head than to go with any
one else at half the price.
I want you, Mr. Crowley," said the
surgeon.
'"Oh, how do you do, doctor. I want
to talk to you just a minute."
"Talk tcr me! Oh, no. You're too
persuasive for a weak willed mortal
with my sort of soft heart. I've talked
to you before, Mr. Crowley. You're too
eloquent for me. Go to your boat."
The barkentine Skagit, second of the
salmon fleet to arrive, 'reached this
port yesterday, 21 days from Naknek.
She brought down 800 barrels of sal
mon. Vessels from Alaska have to
pass quarantine inspection before being
granted free pratique. A misunder-
Btacding of this yesterday got three
launch loads of boatmen and runners
into trouble. The Skagit was from
Alaska and without a thought of quar
antine the boatmen headed their
launches for the salmon packet. As
soon, as she dropped anchov, the
launches were run alongside and with
in a few minutes Captain Robinson
was the center of a clamoring throng
who wanted to sell him meat, to do
his boating while in port; wanted the
privilege of taking ashore his fisher
men passengers; wanted to sell him
anti-fouling paint; to fix up his chro
nometers; to mend his clothes, to take
his photograph; to sell him lottery
tickets; to carry his baggage; to sell
him Pill's manual. They were all there
on business bent,
When the quarantine doctors stepped
aboard tho air was filled with what
s> runded like an operatic chorus chant
ing the want columns of a daily paper.
"All you men get back to your
launches and wait for me," said the
surgeon in charge.

about 21s 3d. usual European options, with no
spot charters reported for some time. The

WHEATâ Chicago advanced l%c on further
damage reports from the Northwest.
Jones of the Commercial West Issued a re
vised estimate of the crop in the Northwest,
placing the figures at 128.000,000 bushels, and 1
estimating the total yield at 504,000,000 bush- 1
els. This Is the lowest crop estimate yet. I
In this market futures were l%c lower on j
the morning session, in sympathy with Chi- |
cago. Spot Wheat was offered freely, but It '
was mostly old crop, which buyers do not
want, taking the new In preference, and then
only sparingly. There Is now plenty of old
Wheat on this market. Quotations are un
changed.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Receipts of small orchard fruits are steadily
decreasing and Drices of all kinds have an
upward tendency. Local trading was even
more active yesterday than on the preceding
day and the best offerings of all kinds were
closely cleaned ux> at the close. Receipts of
Peaches from Oregon were light and It Is ex
pected that they will continue so for some
time, as supplies have been diverted to the
East. Apples and Pears were quoted firm,
with stocks comparatively light. â¢ and Plums,
Prunes and Figs did better. Melons were in
good request and Cantaloupes and Nutmeg
Melons brought higher prices. Grapes In small
packages were plentiful and rather weak, ex
cept for the fanciest shipping stock, while !
open boxes were firm and generally higher. !
The canners were offering $5y&i'.O per ton for
Clingstone Peaches and bid as high as $35 for
Freestones, but were unÂ«blo to procure any
I great quantity at these figures. The demand
j for Lemons and Grace Fruit showed some lm-
I provement, but prices were no higher.

Dried Fruits, Nuts, Raisins, Honey.
All descriptions remain about as before
quoted. Prunes continue weak and quiet. Re
newed attempts are being made to continue the
Raisin Growers' Association, but are thus far
I meeting with poor support. There is some de
; mand for assorted cars of new Fruits, but the
! general business Is not heav. Almonds rule
1 firm at the unusually high prices. Honey Is
I heJd so high by growers that the buyers
1 are not taking hold of the market, as al-
I ready mentioned. Were it not for the com
'Â¦ petition of the Cuban and Hawaiian products
! this staple would probably be selling much
i higher than It Is.
The Los Angeles Times says of the Walnut
I crop: "Based on reports from growers and
i shippers of walnuts, this year's crop la estl
! mated at between &00 and 85O twelve-ton car
loads. This is a great advance over the crop
of last year, which amounted to 625 ten-ton
car loads. The wind and rain storm of Sat
urday damaged walnuts somewhat In this end
of the Ean Gabriel Valley, but not enough to
affect to any extent the above estimate of the
season's output. The increase from 6250 tons
last year to about 9750 this year Is said to be
due in large measure to the decrease In the
I falling of the nuts from the blight which
j thrives In damp weather, eating away the
j stem*. The quality this year la the finest."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Aug. 30.â The professional
traders were again In control of the stock
market to-day. Trading was almost exclusively
confined to operations for this account and
manipulation in a number of issues was in
evidence. The day was barren of news or Im
portant developments, though private advices
dealing with the crop situation were rather
pessimistic. The active stocks were at im
provt-J prices at the opening, particularly
United States Steel preferred, which wae the
most conspicuous feature. London was report
ed to have taken frcm 10,000 to 15.000 shares
of this stork, but much of this was believed
to be f9r the thcrt interest there. The advance
in Â£teel preferred was coincident with the
return from abroad of an influential interest
in that corporation, as well as an optimistic
opinion on trade conditions by a former high
official. There was a simultaneous upward
movement in Reading, Southern Railway,
Union Pacific and the local tractions, includ
ing Brooklyn Transit. The strength of these
issues was used as a clcak to cover heavy
realizing pales, a i-onsiderable portion of which
emanated from high-class commission-houses.
A more pronounced reaction began with a
drive against Metropolitan Street Railway and
Metropolitan Securities. This move was ac
companied by detailed statements to show how
the opening of the subway system, now close
at fcan.l, must sÂ»riouÂ«ly affect Metropolitan
<arnings. The closing was irregular, with
net losses in most of the active stocks, though
in few instances were the declines more than
fractional. T:me and demand money show no
tendency to harden. The few railroad returns
of the -iay included that of the Canadian line
for .July, showing a net Increase of $131,000.
United States Government 2s advanced *4
pe-r cent and 3s (coupon) declined as much
on call.
Railroad bonds were irregular. Total sales,
I>ar value, were $.'5,870,000.

CHICAGO, Aug. 30.â For a brief period at
the opening wheat exhibited a fair degree of
firmness, as a result mainly of the bullish
enthusiasm of yesterday. Initial quotations
on December were Uc lower to Me higher, at
$1 O9ii@l 10- Considerable lonr wheat was
offered for Bale, but for a time offerings were
readily taken by commission houses. Senti
ment in the pit had swung around to the
bear side. Many traders were disappointed
at the poor responses made by foreign grain
markets to the sharp advance here yesterday.
Weather conditions also were regarded as
more favorable, temperatures in the North
west, where the previous night the thermom
eter had hovered around the freezing point,
showing a moderate upward tendency. To
add to the eellinsr pressure there was some
talk among traders regarding the probable
effect of the free movement of spring wheat,
which it was confidently predicted would be
induced by present high prices. Consequently
the eariy demand gradually subsided and prices
steadily declined. The weekly Weather Bureau
report was bullish, but the effect on the mar
ket was imperceptible, inasmuch as the report
had been entirely discounted during the past
week by various private advices from the
Northwest. Liberal profit-taking continued
throughout the entire session, the market clos
ing practically at the low point. After touch
ing $1 07fi, December closed at $1 07T<t- Sep
tember sold between $1 05V5 and $1 08^4 and
closed at $1 05%, with a net loss of 2c.
Owing to continued coolness of the weather
a firm tone was manifested in corn at the
start. The clone was weak and almost at the
lowest i>oint of the day. December opened
i,ic to %c higher, at 52H(&^2V4c, and closed at
51VÂ»@51^c.
Bearish statistics and weakness of other
grains caused an easier tone in the oats mar
ket. December opened unchanged to
higher, at Xi^&Xi^c. and closed at 32TÂ»c
Foreign demand for lard stimulated trade in
provisions, the market being fairly active, with
a steady undertone-. At the close October pork
was down 5c; lard was up 5c and ribs showed
a loss of 2J4c.

the car to a stop, but the child was
too near and she was mangled under
the front wheels. The body was so
tightly wedged in the running gear
that it was found necessary to take

Mrs. Mary Large of 3211 Sixteenth
street.* this city, was killed last Mon
day In Mendoclno County as the result
of, a peculiar accident. She had been
enjoying a vacation in the woods near
Albion with a party of friends. They
were riding on a flat car when the
loose end of a broken telephone wire
was caught on one of the wheel. The
wire was wound around the axle and
the strain broke a telephone pole, the
upper end of which fell upon the car,
striking Mrs. Large and breaking her
skull and collar bone. She died within
a few hours after being taken on board
the steamship Pomona. The body m
brought here yesterday by that boat
ant was taken to the Morgue.
Mrs. Large was the wife of Charles
F. Large, the druggist who killed a
man seve'ral months ago by carelessly
giving him carbolic acid instead of dis
tilled water to drink. She was 26 years

Edgar D. Plexotto Banqueted by Fel
low Clubmen on Eve of Depar
ture for Xcw York.
Bohemia was in her most charming
mood last evening to extend a farewell
and "good luck" to Edgar D. Peixotto,
attorney and clubman, who will leave
for New York in a few days to take
unto himself a wife.
Mr. Peixotto made It known to his
fellow Bohemia Club members some
two weeks ago that he had decided to
come from under the wings of the owl
to the shadow of the altar. His en
gagement to Miss Melvina Nathan of
New York, niece of Mrs. Frederick
Nathan, a woman well known in wom
en's club circles, was announced. Hence
the banquet of last evening, the toasts
and all the rest of it.
Thirty-five friends of Mr. Peixotto
gathered in the red room of the Bohe
mian Club at 9 o'clock, and the "round
table" held the viands. Dr. J. Wilson
Shield acted as toastmaster, and, of
course, "Joe" Reddinjj and "Uncle"
George Bromley were there. Newton
Tharp designed the decorations, which
were simple, yet handsome, and Ned
Greenway was not missing at the com
mand to advance and uncork.
Among the representatives of the
army and navy present were Dr.
Brechemin, U. S. A., and Captain Hun
ker of the U. S. S. New York. Charles
Rollo Peters made studies in black cof
fee and white sugar at the elbow of the
guest of the evening. William Greer
Harrison was not among those unac
counted for.
Mr. Pelxotto expects to leave late this
week for New York, where he is to
meet Miss Nathan. The wedding will
take place on September 23 at the resi
dence of Mrs. Frederick Nathan in that

INDICTMENTS PENDING
FOR YEARS DISMISSED
District Attorney Admits Lack of Evi
dence to Convict the Alleged Con
spirators -to Defraud City.
The indictments against Thomas A.
Burns, John J. O'Brien and Edward
D. Swift, charging them with de
frauding the city and county, were
dismissed by Judge Cook yesterday on
motion of District Attorney Byington
on the ground that the evidence was
insufficient to secure a convictlon>
The three defendants were indicted
by the Grand Jury in 1898. Burns was
a school director, O'Brien an inspector
of school buildings and Swift a lum
ber merchant holding the contract to
supply lumber for school buildings. Jt
was alleged that they conspired to de
fraud the city. There was also an In
dictment against Swift, charging him
with obtaining money by false pre
tenses.
Burns and. O'Brien were tried joint
ly before a jury in Judge Cook's court
on May 6, 1901. They both pleaded
"once in jeopardy," but the plea was
unsuccessful. Burns was, acquitted by
the jury under instructions of the
court, but no agreement was reached
in regard to O'Brien. Swift was never
brought to trial. â¢

These changes will be followed by the
closing of the North Shore's general
cflices on Market street and the consol
idation of its ticket office with that of
:he California Northwestern Railway,
a few doors away.
The recent retirement of Assistant
General Manager Rank from the North
Shore is expected to be followed in a
few days by the resignation of several
other officials of that line who served
under his administration.
It was reported on good authority at
the Southern Pacific ofllces yesterday
that several changes are contemplated
in the operating department of the
road. T. R. Jones, who has held the
position of superintendent of the Tucson
division for some time, it is said, will
shortly succeed R. J. Laws, superin
tendent of the Sacramento division, and
another report is that G. C. Pratt, mas
ter mechanic of the road at Sparks,
Nev., is scheduled to supersede H. H.
Forney in a like position at Sacra
mento.
That the Western Pacific Railroad is
nearly ready to undertake the construc
tion of- portions of its projected line
from this city to Salt Lake was evi
denced in an announcement made yes
terday at the local offices of the com
pany to the effect that its agents have
been instructed to secure the necessary
operating material â¢ for this gigantic
task.
Representatives of the company have
gone into the Eastern market for twen
ty freight engines, 200 ballast cars, two
ballast spreaders, two ballast unloadere
and a line of flat, box and gondola cars.
It was also learned that Attorney
Bartnett, who has been in the East for
several months in connection with the
financial end of the enterprise. Is ar
ranging for a trip to the Pacific Coast
of a number of prominent financiers
who have become interested in the
handling of the company's bonds. The
purpose of their visit will be to look
over the company's terminal properties
and inspect as much as possible of the
new overland route.
United States Immigrant Commis
sioner North admitted yesterday that
he had denied a landing to Lee Mee
Ho, a sixteen-year-old Chinese girl
who arrived July 25 on the steamship
China and who was allowed to lie for
thirty days in the detention shed at
the Mail dock without examination.
Even then, it was not until after the
newspapers had begun an inquiry into
the girl's case that the bureau took
any action whatever. Pressure of busi
ness was the excuse given.
The girl claimed to be a native of
this city a/id to have returned to China
twelve years ago. The photograph on
the return certificate was that of a girl
about 4 years old, and the bureau was
unable to identify it as that of the
applicant. On being interviewed by
Mrs. Davis of the Methodist Chinese
Mission the girl expressed her willing
ness if landed to become an inmate of
the mission. The only pretended rela
tive here was a Chinese who said he
was her godfather. She later changed
her mind and refused to go to the
mission, having evidently been in
structed in, the detention sheds by
some of her countrymen. A Chinese
cook who claimed he was engaged to
marry the girl went among his friends
recently and said he wanted to collect
$1200 for the purpose of landing the
girl. He will be obliged to disgorge
the money, now that he has failed
to secure her admittance. An appeal
from North's decision will doubtless
be made to the Secretary of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor.
Mrs. Thompson when seen yesterday
afternoon was very indignant. Sjhe said
she was positive the body of her broth
er-in-law had been sold to one of the
local colleges, and she will compel the
undertaker to produce it or suffer the
consequences. The warrant for Ha
gan's arrest has not yet been signed.
When she visited the potter's field
with Hagan he was unable to find the
body. She alleges that medical colleges
would pay a large sum for the body of
her brother-in-law, as he died of an un
common disease. He was in the City
and County Hospital fully a month be
fore he died, but she did not see him
during that time, and in fact had not
seen him for five months prior to his
death. To satisfy Mrs. Thompson,
Hagan exhumed several bodies, none of
which proved to be that of her missing
relative.
The committee of Supervisors on Hos
pitals and Health yesterday afternoon
began an investigation into the matter
to ascertain if one body could be sub
stituted for another. The undertaker.
In his defense, said that the body he
had received from the City and County
Hosiptal bore the name of Dunn and he
had no other means of identifying it.
If, instead, it was John Daly's body, he
did not consider himself at fault. Ha
gan has no regular undertaking estab
lishment, but houses the dead in an
extemporized morgue on Nineteenth
street, near Guerrero.
Application was made yesterday by
Mrs. Kate Thompson of 228 Nevada
avenue for the arrest of "William J.
Hasan, city undertaker, whom she
charges with having: wrongfully dis
posed of the body of her brother-in-law,
Jolm Dunn, who died at the City and
County Hospital on the 20th of this
month. According to her statement
Hagan at first demanded $20 to disinter
the body, but later reduced the demand
to $15.

Among the defendants sent to the Su-
Charles D. Lvons. whose home is 600
State street. Santa Barbara, was on
combined business and pleasure bent
when he came up to the great city,
and while engaging an apartment at
4S^ Seventh street he saw and was
instantly smitten by the charms of
Miss Rosie Shier., a buxom brunette
who pursues dressmaking for a liveli
hood in that select lodging-house. If
any question had existed , in Lyons'
mind as to the suitableness of the
chamber he was then inspecting it
vanished when he caught a fleeting
glance from Miss Shier's dark orbs
as she sat in an opposite room and de
murely xilied her needle. For another
soul-thrill he would willingly have paid
thrice the rental asked for the sleep
ing place then under discussion. He
hired it on the spot.
No time was lost by the man from
Santa Barbara in forming a speaking
acquaintanceship with the lady of his
adoration. With an infatuated lover's
indiscretion he had not known her two
hours before he told her all about
himself that was worth knowingâ
among other things the fact that he
brought to town with him a consider
able sum of money and that for safety
he always placed it beneath his pillow
before he went to sleep. That's why
he suspected her of having been im
plicated, to say the least, in the ab
straction of his purse, containing $90,
from Its hiding place under his head.
Miss Shier indignantly denied the theft
or any knowledge of it until he ac
cused her, but he ungallantly had her
arrested, just the same.
Between the time of the woman's
arrest and the calling of the case yes
terday before Judge Cabaniss some
one had evidently exercised good of
fices in her behalf, for when Lyons
was called to testify he showed a re
luctance to prosecute that angered the
Assistant District Attorney and final
ly provoked the Judge to order abrupt
ly a dismissal. Under sharp question
ing Lyons acknowledged that Just be
fore entering the courtroom he had
been approached with a proposal to
compromise, and he thought he would
better accept it, as he could not posi
tively swear that Miss Shier had either
taken his money or Informed somebody
else how it might be taken. After the
dismissal he and Miss Shier and a mas
culine arbitrator- held earnest and ex
tended converse in the corridor.
There was nothing effeminate about
Dennis Keefe's personal appearance as
he stood before Police Judge Conlan
yesterday morning, but he displayed
less firmness of purpose than did either
his wife or . daughter," who jointly
charged him with having disturbed the
peace. Their accusation was unequivo
cal and their desire _to prosecute him
inflexible, while he faltered and toyed
with the court's courtesy and time as
the debutante juggles with her first
proposal to wed.
"I demand a jury trial," he said after
the two women had sworn that on Sun
day last he invaded the restaurant
they keep at 150S Kentucky street and
behaved so boisterously that in self-de
fense they were compelled to summon
police aid.
"All right. Mr. Keefe, a jury trial
you shall have," said the Judge pleas
antly; "and until you have it you must
furnish a bond for your appearance
when called."
Dennis then turned to his attorney
and asked if that person would furnish
the required bail. The attorney replied
that he would like a little. time to con
sider the question.
"Oh, if that's the case." exclaimed
Dennis. "I don't want a jury trial. Let
us go on with the case right now."
"I would be delighted to accommo
date you, Mr. Keefe," said his Honor,
"but we are a little pinched for time
this morning. Your case is continued
till Saturday and you are ordered into
custody till then."
"Oh. hâ 1! Then I guess I'll have a
jury trial."
"All right again," was the unruffled
response from the bench. "A jury trial
you'll get, and on September 30 the
date for it shall be set. You shall re
main In jail until September 30, and
how much longer than that your incar
ceration shall continue depends upon
the date I set for your trial and what
the jury shall then do with you."
Keefe looked rather dazed as he re
turned to the cage. If he had not fooled
with the court's good nature, but stood
trial then and there, his total sentence
would not have exceeded thirty days.
John Ross denied that he had struck
a lad named Venezuela, who accused
him of battery, but Judge Fritz elicited
from Ross a confession that he had
kicked the complainant. Sentence to
day.
Antonio Fenlpo, scavenger, dumped
a wag-onload of garbage upon a vacant

For stealing a -watch from Edward
Rolkins In a Third-street hotel W. J.
Greenfield was given six months by
Judge Conlan.
"Without attempting to go. for a rec
ord I'll send you back there right now."
"For how* long?" Inquired Mamie.
"Six months," the Judge answered.
Mamie Marsh was released from pris
on ten days ago after serving three
months, for drunkenness, and yester
day she reappeared before Judge Con
lan on a similar charge, pressed by
Patrolman Stelzner.
"What did you come back so soon
for?" the Judge asked.
"Just to see how quickly I could get
back to Jail," replied Mamie, laugh
ing.
J. T. Early of 131 Polk street'con
fessed that he was. not entirely sober
when he missed a five-dollar gold piece
from one of his pockets and formally
accused John Haggery, an able sea
man, of having feloniously abstracted
It. It was in a Third-street saloon,
Early averred, that he was spending
his money like a gentleman when the
coin disappeared. Among the benefi
ciaries of his prodigal outlay for liquids
was Haggery, a fact that made that
person's alleged conduct all the more
reprehensible. If he (Early) had not
Imbibed so heavily he might have sus
pected that Haggery had designs upon
his treasury, for the devotion with
which Haggery clung to his side was
extraordinary. There was no question
that the half-eagle was removed by
the finger of some person who
"dipped" for it, nor was there any
doubt in Early's mind that Haggery
was that person. Judge Conlan con
tinued the case till September 7. v
Both the defendants politely but
firmly denied that they had disturbed
the peace or that they were "soused"
in any degree. , While returning to
their home from the dance hall in
which they had been engaged all the
evening they were struck by the beauty
of the night and as if by single im
pulse they started to humâ not to sing
âan air brimming with tender senti
ment. At no time did they lift their
voices to the peace disturbance pitch,
nor did they at any time create vocal
discord. Thev had sung "O, Promise
Me" often, and in unison, and by prac
tice were Qualified to bring out all
the harmony it was capable of yield
ing. The accusation that they were
"soused." or in any thing like that
condition of inebriety, was simply too
absurd to merit serious denial.
His Honor firmly declined an offer
from the defendants to let him heir
for himself whether they could alng
or not, and then allowed them to go
free.
Lucy Kellv, soprano, and Alice Ber
nard, contralto, were raising their
voices in song when Policeman Nelson
arrested them at 2:15 o'clock yesterday
morning on Pacific street, near Kear
ny. "O, Promise Me That Some Day
You and I," from the opera of "Robin
Hood," was the song they warbled, and
the officer told Judge Cabaniss that at
a more seemly time and place it would
have been rather pleasing. Miss Ber
nard's lower register was rather rau
cous, he hinted, but her middle voiceâ
the real singing voiceâ needed no ren
ovation. As for Miss Kelly, her vocal
ism would doubtless have been clearer
of tone and her enunciation of the ap
pealing words more intelligible if she
had not been "half-soused." However,
he had paid money and got worse sing
ing in return for it than the defend
ants jointly produced, and as a music
devotee he felt rather reluctant to press
the peace disturbance charge which he
had entered against them.
It was for stealing $250 from Hugh
McKay of Oakland that Harry Fox
was sent to stand trial in the upper
court. McKay was intoxicated on the
Barbary Coast, and swore that he was
escorted from there to a lodging-house
at 116 Fourth street by the defendant,
who engaged a room for him. The
landlady of the house testified that
Fox left McKay in the room a few
minutes after they had entered it to
gether, but returned about an hour
later, softly stole into the same- room,
stayed there about a minute in the
darkness and then rushed out and down
the stairs. It was her positive identi
fication of Fox that led to his arrest
and conviction. He had no attorney
and made a sorry bungle of attempting
to conduct his own defense, eliciting
statements from the witnesses that an
experienced practitioner would have
guarded against.
